INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM — DAY 1

A WEIRD FLICKERING WHITE LIGHT strobes the screen accompanied by
PROJECTOR NOISE and an OFFSCREEN CONTROL VOICE

CONTROL VOICE
54321detonate

The light becomes brighter as we pan over to

MARTY MCFLY 17 agood looking kid wearing Porsche mirrored sunglasses The
mirrored lenses reflect the MUSHROOM CLOUD of an ATOMIC EXPLOSION

THE RED HOT OPENING MUSIC KICKS IN MAIN TITLES BEGIN
Marty starts bopping along to the rock and roll he’s plugged into a WALKMAN STEREO

We are in a contemporary HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM where 30-odd STUDENTS are 2
watching a 16mm documentary about nuclear tests of the 1950s

SERIES OF SHOTS — MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE 3

BORED STUDENTS watch the black and white movie Only MARTY is enjoying himself as
he listens to his stereo MARTY’S FOOT taps in time to the music

The teacher MRS WOODS 45 looks around the classroom making sure the students
are paying attention She has her “Classroom Planner” in hand

The DOCUMENTARY depicts preparations for another atomic test noting that as many as
20 were done per year in the 1950s Footage shows how tract houses were constructed
and peopled with mannequins to measure the effects of radiation

MARTY oontinues bopping along

MRS WOODS notices the one head in the classroom bobbing MARTY’S FOOT continues
tapping in time Now a PAIR OF WOMAN’S SHOES step into FRAME

MRS WOODS is standing next to Marty arms crossed staring at him But Marty is
oblivious to her

SUZY PARKER 17 an attractive girl looks over at the situation in horror
Mrs Woods waves her hand in front of Marty’s sunglasses No reaction
Suzy turns her head — she can’t bear to watch

Mrs Woods gently removes Martys sunglasses His eyes are closed
Now Marty opens his eyes He looks up at Mrs Woods and smiles weakly

Mrs Woods does not smile back She rips the headphones off — the MUSIC abruptly
stops

MRS WOODS
Mr McFly detention
CUT TO
INT STRICKLAND’S OFFICE — DAY

CLOSE ON MARTY’S WALKMAN in a pair of ELDERLY MALE HANDS being placed in a
WOODWORKING VISE mounted on the corner of adesk

WIDER — STRICKLAND ’S OFFICE

Marty fidgets uneasily in an uncomfortable wooden chair in the sparse office as MR
STRICKLAND a humorless disciplinarian tightens the vise Strickland looks 60 but he
could be 160 — he was born old and stayed that way and has been at this school forever

Strickland gazes at Marty then gives the vise a hard mean wrench The Walkman
CRUNCHES itsounds like bones breaking

Marty cringes
Strickland smiles sadistically and hands it back to him

MR STRICKLAND
That’s number three isn’t it McFly

MARTY
Four

MR STRICKLAND
You don’t like school do you McFly

Marty rolls his eyes Is this question for real

MARTY
Oh no sir LOVE school

MR STRICKLAND
(snaps at him)
Youve got a real attitude problem you know that
(opens a file on his desk)
Youre a slacker McFly Youve got aptitude but you don’t apply yourself
You remind me of your father He was a slacker too

Marty just sits there bored

MR STRICKLAND
Now for slacking off in class and for having a serious attitude problem your
punishment is two weeks in detention with me starting this afternoon

MARTY
This afternoon But can’t Me and my band have an audition at 345 for
the YMCA dance It’s really important that be there — they’re counting on
me gotta be there at 345

MR STRICKLAND
Too bad McFly guess this isn’t your day
Marty is sick
CUT TO

INT DETENTION CLASSROOM — ON A WALL CLOCK — DAY
It’s 328

WIDER

A regular math classroom used as detention after hours Again we see signs of an old
school dressed to be more modern green chalkboards repainted walls new desks anda
sprinkler system

8 or 10 STUDENTS are seated far apart from each other throughout the room All are
supposedly studying One of them has a SKATEBOARD along with his books

MARTY is at the pencil sharpener in the back sharpening a pencilbut the look on his
face indicates he’s up to something He looks at the clock looks up at the SPRINKLER
PIPE then glances toward the front of the room

MR STRICKLAND sits at the teachers desk grading a LARGE STACK OF PAPERS
Marty finishes at the sharpener He sticks a PIECE OF GUM in his mouth and starts
chewing like mad Then he steps alongside the CAROUSEL SLIDE PROJECTOR and
surreptitiously sneaks the lens into his jacket pocket He quickly retums to his seat

Now Strickland stands up and starts toward Marty Did he see Marty swipe the lens No
he’s merely “patrolling” the room

When Strickland isn’t looking Marty produces a matchbook and a rubber band from the
pencil pouch of his loose leaf binder He opens the matchbook cover and sticks his gum to
the backside

He waits for Strickland to walk past him then quickly Marty stands and using the rubber
band fires the matchbook at the ceiling

Strickland whirls around upon hearing the snap but Marty is already seated “studying”
Strickland looks around suspiciously but sees nothing He continues along

Marty glances up The gum is holding the matchbook on the ceiling right near the sprinkler
valve He smiles

Now Marty sets his mirrored sunglasses on his leg positioning them to reflect the rays of
the sun up at the matchbook

That done he pulls the lens out of his pocket and focuses the beam onto the matchbook
He adjusts the lens ever so slightly there Perfect A hot white pinpoint of light is focused
on the matchbook

MR STRICKLAND returns to his paper grading He marks an entire set of answers wrong
and puts “F” at the top of apaper The next paper has two right Strickland gives it an “F”

MARTY continues holding the lens as steady as he can watching anxiously for results

ABOVE there is a faint trace of SMOKE on the matchbook

THE CLOCK now reads 337

STRICKLAND grades his LAST PAPER THEN STANDS UP AND STARTS PULLING
DOWN THE WINDOW SHADES

MARTY is horrified Strickland is 3 shades away from Marty’s window Marty looks
anxiously up at the matchbook

MARTY
(under his breath)
Come on come on
Strickland pulls down the next shade

There is more smoke from the matchbook

MARTY
Burn you sucker

Strickland pulls down another shade The next one is Marty’s
Strickland steps toward it

Suddenly the matchbook ignites FIRE

Immediately the FIRE ALARM SOUNDS and the SPRINKLERS GO OFF

MARTY
FIRE

Students jump up and scream as water sprays all over them They rush for the door
MARTY grabs the kid with the skateboard named W EEZE

MARTY
Weeze — let me borrow this Ill bring it back tomorrow

Marty takes the skateboard and dashes out

MR STRICKLAND
Stop Wait We must file out in an orderly fashion

Another sprinkler goes off and sprays Strickland right in the face
EXT HILL VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL — DAY

It’s a classic WPA style high school built in the 1930s Marty dashes out jumps on the
skateboard and skateboards down the front steps

EXT HILLY RESIDENTIAL STREET — DAY

Marty comes from around the corner skateboards down a hill weaving through traffic He
skateboards like a champ

EXT STREET — TOWN SQUARE — DAY
This is HILL VALLEY a northern California town it’s October The town has been here a
while — and its town square business district is beginning to deteriorate undoubtedly
because there’s a mall someplace

The old courthouse now the Department of Social Services has a clock tower — but the
clock is stopped at 1002

A time and temperature clock on the BANK reads 343

MARTY skateboards down the business street and across traffic narrowly missing being
hit by a car

INT YMCA — STAGE — DAY

3 MEMBERS ofthe PINHEADS rock band KEYBOARDS BASS and DRUMS exchange
nervous glances repeatedly checking their watches Theyre all set up on stage

SUZY PARKER is also here — but she’s not part of the band
Suddenly Marty skateboards onto the stage

SUZY
Marty

Marty gives her a wink she smiles

Marty’s guitar amp and microphone have already been set up for him He picks up the
guitar and tunes up then looks over at Suzy

Suzy smiles and holds up her crossed fingers Marty grins back Clearly theyre “an item”

Marty practices a riffand he’s great You can’t tell where the guitar ends and the man
begins He turns and addresses the dance committee

MARTY
All right we re the Pinheads and we re gonna rock ‘n roll

They kick into a red hot number Martys fingers dance across the strings and frets in a
complicated lead line He’s terrific and the band sounds great

They get only about 25 seconds into the number when a VOICE calls out

DANCE COMMITTEEMAN
That’s enough Thank you

Marty and the group stop playing exchanging bewildered glances

CUT TO

EXT TOWN SQUARE — DAY

On some of the boarded up buildings are ELECTION POSTERS “RE-ELECT MAYOR
‘GOLDIE’ WILSON HONESTY DECENCY INTEGRITY” and a picture of the incumbent
Mayor Wilson is black about 45 with aGOLD FRONT TOOTH

MARTY and SUZY are walking together She carries her schoolbooks he has the
skateboard And he’s depressed

SUZY
Marty one rejection isnt the end of the world

MARTY
don’t know Maybe I’m just not cut out for music

SUZY
But youre good Marty You’re really good And this audition tape of yours
is great (she gives him back aCASSETTE TAPE) Youve got to send it in
to that record company

MARTY
But what if they hate it What if they say “get outta here kid you got no
future” Why should put myself through all that anxiety (He sighs) I’m
sorry guess sound like some kinda schizoid neurotic

SUZY
Well according to my shrink all of our emotional anxieties are a direct result
of the influence our parents had in our childhood

MARTY
In that case you can kiss me off right now Youve met my old man You
know what a zero heis

Suzy nods knowingly They are walking past a TOYOTA DEALERSHIP

SUZY
At least he’s letting you borrow the car tomorrow night Thats a step in the
right direction

MARTY
Hey I’m TAKING the car tomorrow night That way it saves him the anxiety
of making a decision

Marty spots a tricked-out black SUPRA in the showroom

MARTY
Hey check out that tricked-out Supra Now THATS a car (sighs admiring it
longingly) Someday Suzy someday

SUZY
What about your mother Does she know

MARTY
Are you kidding She thinks I’m going camping with the guys If she found
out was going camping with you shed shit

Marty sprays some BINACA in his mouth
SUZY

(nods knowingly)
My shrink says a lot of parents are sexually repressed
MARTY
My moms not sexually repressed How can you be repressed about
something you know absolutely nothing about

They pause across from the former courthouse building

SUZY
(flirting)
She’s just trying to keep you respectable

MARTY
(flirting back)
She’s not doing a very good job is she

They move closer

SUZY
Terrible

Theyre about to kiss

CLOCK WOMAN (OS)
Save the Clock Tower

Marty and Suzy turn A middle-aged CHURCH GROUP TYPE WOMAN has a donation can
and an armful of printed FLYERS

CLOCK WOMAN
Please make a donation to save the clock tower

MARTY
Lady can’t you see I’m busy here

CLOCK WOMAN
Mayor Wilsonis sponsoring an initiative to repair that clock

She points to the stopped clock on the old courthouse building

CLOCK WOMAN
(continuing)
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

MARTY
But it doesn’t tell time What good is it

CLOCK WOMAN
It’s part of our history Here — it’s all in this flyer (gives Marty one) 30
years ago lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasnt run since
We at the society feel it’s a landmark of scientific importance attesting to
the power of the Almighty

MARTY
All right lady Here’s a quarter
Marty drops a quarter into her can
She nods and moves along to bother someone else
MARTY
(to Suzy)
Now you were saying that my mother wasn’t doing a very good job
They move closer again as before about to kiss

Suddenly a MALE VOICE booms out over a PA

SPEAKER VOICE Marty Marty McFly

Marty turns

A medium sized RV with speakers mounted on the side is idling across the street The
vehicle is quite used Its towing a tarped vehicle on a trailer

Marty recognizes it and rolls his eyes

MARTY
Doc I’m busy

DRIVER
Itll only take a minute

MARTY

(to Suzy)

Come on you should see whats inside this thing
They go over and step inside
INT RV — TOWN SQUARE — DAY

The driver is DR EMMETT BROWN about 65 He looks like an old hippie with shoulder
length white hair Hawaiian shirt faded jeans an Indian turquoise around his neck and
lively — almost wild — eyes He’s full of energy full of life talks fast and is immediately
likable for his eccentricities

With him in the RV is his big DOG “EINSTEIN”

The inside of the vehide is full of CLOCKS — every imaginable type a Cuckoo a
Grandfather even a classic “Felix the Cat with moving eyes” All of them are in dead sync
There is also a bank of state-of-the-art component video and audio equipment The 25-inch
monitor is tuned to MTV There are discarded fast food cartons anda spilled box of sugar
coated cereal an unmade bed a doggie dish and tools and electronic parts We might
also notice a lead canister with purple radiation symbols

MARTY
Whats up Doc

BROWN
One am right Marty Youre gonna be there right Twin Pines Mall
MARTY
Yeah right

Brown takes the “Save the Clock” flyer out of Marty’s hand

BROWN
Let me write it down for you so you dont forget (writes on the back) “Twin
Pines Mall one am” Twin Pines Mall — remember when that used to be
Peabody’s farm It was all farmland out there No — guess that was
before your time Marty

He folds the flyer and sticks it in Martys pocket
BROWN
(continuing)

Youre feeling all right Marty Youve been getting plenty of rest

MARTY
Yeah but Doc exactly what are we gonna do at one am

BROWN
You want me to spoil it for you Don’t worry about it — it’ll be great

MARTY

Youre not planning on breaking into another power plant or something
That was kinda risky

BROWN
That’s the point Marty Risk Risk makes life worth living What would you
rather do sleep
Brown checks one of the 4 watches on his arm
BROWN
(sudden urgency)
It’s almost time — quiet

Suzy gives Marty a bewildered look but Marty knows what’s about to happen

It’s exactly 4 oclock and all of the clocks CHIME at once — dings dongs electronic
tones cuckoo birds

Brown loves it — he drinks it up like a proud father

BROWN
love that
MARTY
Look Doc weve gotta go Illsee you tonight
BROWN

Yes At one am It could change your life

Marty and Suzy step out of the RV

OF

EXT STREET — TOWN SQUARE — DAY
Marty and Suzy watch the RV go

SUZY
don’t know if you should be hanging out with a guy like that after midnight

MARTY
Doc Brown’s all right — he’s just a little hung up on time A couple of years
ago he showed up at my house and hired me to sweep out this garage of
his He pays me 50 bucks a week gives me free beer and gives me total
access to his record collection — he’s got this great old record collection
(a beat)
Hard to believe he was one of the world’s greatest nuclear physicists

Down the street Brown’s RV waits for an ELDERLY MAN to hobble across the street
Brown’s voice booms out over his P A

BROWN (VO PA)
Let’s move it Gramps Youre not that old

Suzy gives Marty a look of disbelief
MARTY
(shrugs)
Too much radiation guess
(a beat moves closer to her)
Where were we
She smiles and moves toward him

SUZY
think we were right here

Again theyre about to kiss
A CAR HORN HONKS LOUDLY Suzy turns away

SUZY
Thats my Dad See you tomorrow

She hops into the waiting car Marty watches it go

MARTY
This is not my day

EXT MCFLY HOUSE — DUSK

A WRECKER is in the McFly driveway with a 1979 Plymouth Reliant in tow its front end is
completely smashed as if someone rammed it into a brick wall The truck driver is

unhitching it

Looking on with horror is timid GEORGE McFLY 47 abalding boring uninspired man

13

who wears a suit he bought at Sears 4 years ago

Next to him is BIFF TANNEN 48 an intimidating lout who wears gold chains and pinky
rings with sartorial taste to match

MARTY skateboards up to the scene and is shocked He listens as Biff lambasts his father

BIFF
can’t believe you did this McFly can’t believe you loaned me your car
without telling me it had a blind spot could have been killed

GEORGE
Biff never noticed any blind spot before

BIFF
It’s there McFly How else can you explain this

GEORGE
Can assume that your insurance will pay for this

BIFF

My insurance It’s your car Your insurance should pay for it wanna know
who’s gonna pay for THIS (indicates his stained suit) spilled beer all over
it when that car hit me Whos gonna pay the cleaning bill

George hesitates then meekly pulls out his wallet

GEORGE
Do you think 20 dollars will cover it

Biff snatches the 20 dollar bill out of George’s hand

BIFF
It’s a start And hey where’s my reports

GEORGE
Well havent finished them yet figured since they werent due till
Monday

BIFF
(knocks on Georges head)
Hello Anybody home Think McFly think Ive gotta have time to get ‘em
retyped If turn in my reports in your handwriting Ill get fired

GEORGE
Okay Ill finish them tonight and run them over first thing in the morning

BIFF
Not too early — sleep in on Saturday
(about to leave)
Oh hey McFly your shoe’s untied
GEORGE
(falling for it)
Huh

He looks down and Biff hits him on the chin Biff laughs loudly

BIFF
Don’t be so gullible McFly

Biff walks over to his sparkling year old CADILLAC on the street He spots Marty

BIFF
Hiya kid How do you like my new paint job

Marty doesn’t He steps over to his father outraged He’s about to say something but
George raises his hands and cuts him off

GEORGE
know what youre going to say son and youre right Youre right But he
happens to be my supervisor and Im afraid I’m just not very good at
confrontations

MARTY
But Jesus Christ Dad look at the car Look what he did to the car
GEORGE
know And I know you were counting on using it and Im sorry
MARTY
Do you have any idea how important this was to me Dad Do you have any
idea at all
GEORGE
(shrugs)
Well guess don’t
Biff screeches out in his Cadillac
MARTY
Dad did it ever occur to you to say “no” To just once try saying “no”
GEORGE
Son know it’s hard for you to understand but the fact is I’m just not a
fighter
MARTY

Try it once Dad Just one time say “no”

Now the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR sticks his head out the window of the adjacent house
He’s 40 pot-bellied named HOWARD

HOWARD
Hey McFly My kids selling Girl Scout cookies told her youd be good for
a case
Marty shakes his head George gulps then calls back

GEORGE
Well okay
Marty shakes his head hopelessly

INT AT THE McFLY DINNER TABLE — NIGHT 15

The McFly family is dining on meat loaf Kraft macaroni and cheese Bird’s Eye mixed
vegetables and French’s instant mashed potatoes

Martys mother LORRAINE 47 was once very attractive Now she’s OVERWEIGHT in a
rut a victim of suburban stagnation She has more food on her plate than anyone else and
a glass of vodka

GEORGE has papers in front of him instead of food he’s doing the work Biff gave him
He’s also glancing at the TV which is tuned to a “Honeymooners” rerun

Sister LINDA 19 is cute but wears too much eye makeup brother DAVE 22 wears a
MCDONALD’S UNIFORM and is wolfing down his food

GEORGE

(to Marty)
Believe me son youre better off not having the aggravation of dealing with
that YMCA dance Youd have to worry about getting all your equipment
there making contingency plans in case someone got sick making sure you
got paid correctly settling with the Musician’s union and what if you were
so good that other people wanted to hire you Youd have to worry about
scheduling your jobs around school Believe me son youre better off
without those headaches

LINDA
Oh Mother there’s nothing wrong with calling a boy

LORRAINE
Well think it’s terrible girls chasing boys never chased a boy when was
your age never called a boy or asked a boy on a date or sat in a parked
car with a boy Because when you behave like that boys wont respect you
Linda They’ll think youre cheap

Linda rolls her eyes She’s heard this a million times

seemed so helpless like a little lost dog And my heart just went out to him

LINDA
Yeah Mom youve told us a million times “Florence Nightingale to the
rescue”
LORRAINE

(thoughtfully remembering)
The next weekend we went on our first date the “Enchantment Under the
Sea” school dance Ill never forget it — it was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm Remember George

GEORGE
What’s that dear

LORRAINE
(ignores him to Marty and Linda)
Your father kissed me for the very first time on the dance floor and that
was when realized was going to spend the rest of my life with him
Marty and Linda exchange a look and shake their heads

LINDA

LORRAINE
Well may have encouraged him a little

MARTY

Marty gets up finished eating
LORRAINE

from the table

Marty is already out of the room

MARTY (0S)
May be excused

16 INT MARTY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT

Marty’s walls are covered with posters of rock stars and cars — particularly Toyota Supras

There is also a portable home synthesizer a tape recorder and a stack of lead sheets
Marty sits at his desk with an submission form that has an “R and G RECORDS’ letterhead
an envelope and the cassette tape Suzy Parker gave him There’s also a picture of Suzy
there

He signs the form and puts it in the envelope along with the cassette tape He is about to

seal it — then he hesitates and ponders a moment He stares at the envelope — it’s
addressed to the “R and G RECORDS NEW TALENT DIVISION” He sighs shakes his
head pulls the tape out and chucks the envelope and application into the trash can
CUT TO
16-A INT MARTY’S BEDROOM — CLOCK ON MARTY’S NIGHTSTAND 16-A
It’s almost 1230 CAMERA PANS to pick up Marty lying asleep on the bed fully clothed
Now Martys CORDLESS PHONE beeps Marty stirs and answers it
MARTY
(into phone)
Hello
(a beat rolls his eyes)
No havent forgotten Doc One am Twin Pines Mall
He hangs up and shakes his head
CUT TO
17 EXT TWIN PINES MALL PARKING LOT — NIGHT 17

CAMERA PANS from the lit entrance sign depicting 2 PINE TREES with “TWIN PINES
MALL” in lettering below (along with a digital clock at 1259) to pick up MARTY on his
skateboard with another WALKMAN (it’s a different brand than the one Strickland

smashed) Marty skateboards around a corner of the mall and sees Brown’s RV on the

vast sodium vapor lit parking lot DR BROWN is dad in a white radiation suit hood off

(still with his Indian turquoise around his neck)and EINSTEIN are both next to

A SLEEK STAINLESS STEEL DELOREAN SPORTS CAR It’s been modified with some

wicked looking units onits rear engine giving itt a particularly dangerous feel There are
coils along the front and rear decks

There are also several small cases of supplies and equipment and a piece of American
Tourister luggage around the RV

Marty skateboards over totally blown away by the car

MARTY
Jeez Doc a DeLorean What the hell did you do to it

BROWN
Grab the camera and start taping Marty Ill explain as we go

Brown indicates a HOME VIDEO CAMERA nearby Marty picks it up

MARTY
And whats with the Devo suit

Brown lifts open the driver’s side gull wing door

BROWN
Come on Einstein Get in boy
The dog obediently jumps in and sits in the drivers seat Brown buckles him in with the
shoulder harness The dog has aBATTERY OPERATED DIGITAL CLOCK hanging
around his neck
Marty begins taping handheld cinema verite style
BROWN
(to Marty and video camera)
All right this is test 1 Please note that Einsteins clock here is in precise
synchronization with my control watch
Brown holds up a digital watch next to Einsteins clock indeed the two are in dead sync
BROWN
(to the dog)
Good luck Einie

Brown reaches in and starts the ignition The DeLorean engine ROARS to life Brown turns
on the headlights and lowers the gull wing door sealing Einstein in

He steps back and picks up a REMOTE CONTROL UNIT similar to one for a radio
controlled toy car There are buttons labeled “Accelerator” and “Brake” a joystick and an
LED digital readout labeled “Miles Per Hour” Brown flicks the power switch on and using
the accelerator button and joystick for steering sends the DeLorean down to the far far
end of the parking lot He turns the car around so that it’s pointing toward them idling
BROWN

Here we go Marty If my calculations are correct when the car hits 88 miles

an hour youre gonna see some serious shit
Brown takes a deep breath then pushes the accelerator button
The DeLorean takes off shifting gears automatically
The LED speedometer passes 30
The stainless steel vehicle zooms faster past 40
Marty is getting it all on tape

Brown watches intently The speedometer climbs past 60

IN THE CAR Einstein remains calmly in the drivers seat Gauges and instrument lights
mounted behind him begin flashing

Brown’s finger holds the accelerator button down
The meter passes 75

The DeLorean keeps accelerating approaching Marty and Brown The coils mounted
around the car begin glowing

EXT MALL DELOREAN — NIGHT

The speedometer hits 85 86 87 88

The automobile is suddenly engulfed by a BLINDING WHITE GLOW — then BLAM It’s
gone a TRAIL OF FIRE left in its wake

Brown and Marty are hit by a sharp blast of air Marty blinks in disbelief it’s as if the car 19
never existed Only the LICENSE PLATE is left behind — a vanity plate “NO TIME”

BROWN

(elated)
Whatd tell you 88 miles per hour Temporal displacement occurred at
(checks watch) exactly 102 am and zero seconds

MARTY
(shocked)
Christ Almighty You disintegrated Einstein

BROWN
Calm down Marty didn’t disintegrate anything The molecular structure of
both Einstein and the car are completely intact

MARTY
Then where the hell are they

BROWN
The appropriate question is WHEN the hell are they You see Einstein has
just become the world’s first time traveler sent him into the future — one
minute into the future to be exact And at exactly 103 am and zero
seconds we shall catch up to him and the time machine

MARTY
Time machine Are you trying to tell me you built a time machine out of a
DeLorean

BROWN

(smiles modestly)
The way figured it if youre gonna build a time machine into a car why not
do it with some style Besides the stainless steel construction made the flux
dispersal—
(his digital watch BEEPS)
Ten seconds Roll tape — and brace yourself for a sudden displacement of
air

Marty aims the camera right where the DeLorean disappeared Brown grips the remote
control unit tightly and counts down

BROWN
54321

Their hair stands up on end charged up with static electricity

Suddenly a SHARP BLAST OF WIND comes up out of nowhere along with a 20
DEAFENING SONIC BOOM — and the DELOREAN REAPPEARS right where it vanished

still going 88 mph

Brown hits the brake button 21

The car wheels lock up and the DeLorean comes to aSCREECHING HALT smoke
pouring off the body

Brown and Marty rush over to the car Brown approaches cautiously and reaches for the
door handle He touches it and recoils in pain

MARTY
Is it hot

BROWN
It’s cold Damned cold

Brown raises the driver’s side door there sits Einstein none the worse for wear Brown
again compares his watch with Einstein’s

INSERT — WATCHES
Einsteins reads 10210 Brown’s is 10310
BACK TO SHOT

BROWN
Exactly one minute difference — and still ticking

MARTY
Is Einstein all right

Brown unbuckles the shoulder harness and Einstein bounds out happy and playful Brown
gives the dog a Mik Bone reward

BROWN
Good boy Einie

(to Marty)
He’s fine And he’s completely unaware that anything happened As far as
he’s concerned the trip was instantaneous Thats why his watchis a
minute behind mine — he “skipped over” that minute to instantly arrive at
this moment in time Come here let me show you how it works

Marty is still a bit skeptical uneasy Brown waves him over like a kid who wants to show
off a new toy Marty approaches cautiously

BROWN
First you turn the time circuits on

Brown flips the labeled switch An array of indicator lights go on inside

BROWN
(continuing)
This readout tells you where youre going this one tells you where you are
this one tells you where you were

The three readouts are respectively labeled “DESTINATION TIME” “PRESENT TIME” and
“LAST TIME DEPARTED”

BROWN
(continuing)
You input your destination time on this keypad Want to see the signing of
the Declaration of Independence

He punches 7-4-1776 The “DESTINATION TIME” readout lights up with the date
BROWN
(continuing)
Or witness the birth of Christ
He punches in 12-25-0
BROWN
(continuing)

Here’s a red letter date in the history of science March 19 1955

He pauses realizing something — as if something suddenly makes sense to him

BROWN
Yes of course March 19 1955

MARTY
What happened then

BROWN

That was the day invented time travel Actually it was night remember it
vividly got hit over the head and when came to had a revelation — a
vision — apicture in my head A picture of THIS

Brown points to a particular centerpiece unit mounted inside the DeLorean

Marty aims the video camera and gets it on tape He continues taping as Dr Brown
explains

BROWN
This is what makes time travel possible the TFC — Temporal Field
Capacitor

MARTY

Temporal Field Capacitor huh Howd you get beaned

BROWN
Well was trying to— (stops short thinking better of it) Well it’s not
important What is important is that it works It’s taken me over 30 years to
fulfill the vision of that night

He faces the DeLorean proudly

MARTY
Heavy duty Doc And it runs on like regular unleaded gasoline

BROWN
Unfortunately no It requires something with a little more kick
Brown indicates a container with purple radioactivity symbols on it

MARTY
(reads the label)
Plutonium You mean this sucker’s nuclear

BROWN
Electrical But need anuclear reaction to generate the 121 jigowatts of
electricity need The TFC stores it then discharges it all at once like a
gigantic bolt of lightning Oh youd better put on this radiation suit before
reload Not that there’s any danger but it never hurts to take precautions

Brown hands him the YELLOW RADIATION SUIT which is near the RV Marty puts the
camera down

MARTY
Hold the phone Doc — plutonium’s illegal Did you rip it off

BROWN
No of course not Here let me help you with that

Brown helps Marty get into the suit

BROWN
Put your hood up Marty while reload and keep Einstein covered too

Marty and Brown both pull their hoods over their heads Marty covers Einstein with a sheet
of the same radiation proof material

Brown opens the container and removes a 4-inch clear cylinder with a plutonium rod within
(it’s surrounded by water) then closes the container

Brown steps over to the rear of the DeLorean and places the plutonium cylinder into the
loading hopper The plutonium rod drops down into the reactor which then seals shut

BROWN
(removes his hood)
It’s safe now Everything is lead lined

Marty removes his hood and releases Einstein He picks up the video camera and starts
taping again

BROWN
Oh — mustnt forget my luggage

Brown grabs his suitcase and puts it in the trunk (it’s in the front)

BROWN
Who knows if theyll have cotton underwear in the future I’m allergic to all
synthetics
Brown slams the trunk shut
MARTY

The future Is that where youre going
BROWN

That’s right 25 years into the future Ive always dreamed of seeing the
future — looking beyond my years observing the progress of mankind It’s
almost like cheating death
(pauses then smiles wryly)
Ill also be able to find out who wins the next 25 World Series
Suddenly Einstein starts BARKING at something
BROWN
What is it Einie
Brown turns and reacts with horror to an APPROACHING PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS it’s an
ominous VAN
BROWN
Oh no — they found me don’t know how but they found me
MARTY
Who
BROWN
The Libyans
MARTY
What Libyans
BROWN

The Libyans who got me the Plutonium They wanted me to build ‘em a
bomb — told ‘em would but lied

The van side door slides open and a SWARTHY CHARACTER who resembles Yasser
Arafat leans out with an AK 47 submachine gun He OPENS FIRE

BROWN
Run for it Marty Ill draw their fire

Brown pulls a 45 revolver from inside his radiation suit and FIRES at the van He then
breaks for the mall a good 500 yards away

The terrorist van SCREECHES around sharply and gives chase The terrorist FIRES a
machine gun blast

MARTY
Doc — no Wait

But Brown keeps running and firing — and the van closes the distance No way can Brown
outrun it to the mall

The Terrorist gunner screams a Libyan curse then FIRES a burst at Brown
The bullets rip into Brown’s chest and the scientist goes down

Marty stands frozen in horror video camera still in hand

As if hearing Marty the van makes a U-turn it’s coming for Marty
Marty looks around Hes out in the open and has only one chance The DeLorean

Marty dashes for it even as the van accelerates toward him and dives into the still open
drivers door

IN THE CAR

Marty swings the door shut then looks over the array or switches and buttons on the
consok with frightened bewilderment how do you start this thing

Then he spots the keys in the ignition on the steering column just like any other car He
turns it over and shifts into first He floors it

The mall parking lot is suddenly changed into an OPEN FIELD with a SCARECROW in the
middle of it

Marty is speeding toward it at 88 miles an hour — he hits it The scarecrow’s face is
hideously smashed against the windshield

Marty continues toward a HAYSTACK He’s completely disoriented

EXT FARM FIELD AND BARN — NIGHT

The DeLorean speeds right through the haystack and then into an OPEN BARN

We hold on the barn exterior — we hear a CRASH hay and dust are kicked up out the
door then a CRACK OF WOOD — and ALARGE SECTION OF THE BARN ROOF
CAVES IN

We hold on the barn We hear a DOG start BARKING

out in his red flannels carrying a lantern Behind him is his wife MA their buxom 14 year
old DAUGHTER and lively 11 year old son SHERMAN

They approach the barn and cautiously enter through the rear doors

INT BARN — NIGHT 29
The Peabodys stare in open-mouthed astonishment

The stainless steel vehicle faces them head on headlight beams shining through the dust
Suir wheels buried in the straw and amber hazard lights blinking it looks like a SPACE

The COWS in the barn don’t seem to care much but Ma and Pa look up at the hole where
the roof caved in then exchange an uneasy look

MA
What is it Pa

PA
Looks like an airplane without wings

SHERMAN
Airplane It’s a flying saucer Pa From outer space

The driver’s gull wing door rises slowly just like a hatch

Pa motions them all back They watch expectantly uneasily with expressions of curiosity
mixed with fear

Now Marty steps out dazed — he’s in the radiation suit and the HOOD IS DOWN giving
him the appearance of an alien

Ma SCREAMS and faints

PA
Run children Run for your lives

They all run like hell out of the barn
Marty takes a few steps then removes the hood

MARTY
Hey Hello Where am 1

Marty looks around The cows in the barn just chew their cud

Marty shakes his head then steps out the barn door

EXT BARNYARD — NIGHT 30
Marty steps out into the barnyard

MARTY
Excuse me Anybody here
EXT FARM HOUSE — NIGHT

PA busts out of the farmhouse with a double-barreled shotgun Sherman is right behind
him with something rolled up in his hand

SHERMAN
Look Pa — it’s already mutated into human form Shoot it

Pa raises his shotgun and FIRES
Buckshot cracks into the barn wall behind Marty

PA
Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch

He squeezes off the second barrel
Shot explodes in the dirt near Martys feet He dashes back into the barn

Pa breaks the gun and reloads then moves cautiously toward the barn Just as he’s about
to enter the DELOREAN THUNDERS OUT

Pa Peabody jumps back
The car spins around in the barnyard and smashes through a white picket fence
surrounding 2 NEWLY PLANTED PINE TREES IN A LINE just like on the sign at “TWIN

PINES MALL” The DeLorean takes out one of the small trees then finds the dirt access
road and ROARS AWAY

PA
You space bastard You killed one of my pines

Pa FIRES both barrels at the departing vehicle then runs over to his “pine grove”

PA
(extremely upset)
Now I only got one

Now he looks up and sees Ma coming out of the barn She’s dazed rubbing her head

PA
Ma Are you all right

Sherman runs over terrified with a rolled up something in his hand

SHERMAN
Pa No Don’t go near her She’s a zombie Shes got no more free will The
spaceman took over her brain

PA
What the hell are you talking’ boy

SHERMAN
Read this It’s all right here

Sherman shows him his WEIRD SCIENCE COMIC BOOK On the cover is a space ship
that resembles a 50s version of the DeLorean An alien is stepping out who looks
something like Marty in the radiation suit and he appears to have enslaved several human
females The title of the story is “Space Zombies From Pluto”

Pa looks at it then glances over at his wife with trepidation

EXT STREET — DAY

The DeLorean pulls into frame and stops Martys gull wing door opens revealing Marty’s
shocked expression as he sees

HIS OWN HOUSE — (MATTE PAINTING)

BRAND NEW freshly painted — a MODEL HOME complete with colored pennants and
“model home” signs without any landscaping

Next to it is a LARGE SIGN with an artists rendering of an idyllic home nestled between
magnificent oak trees with a proud family of four beside their Cadillac Below in big block
letters “Live in the home of tomorrowtoday Lyon Estates scheduled completion This
Winter”

Beyond it is vacant land with some of it graded for construction There are a few
foundations and perhaps a wood frame or two and the familiar high tension wires

MARTY
is in shock He looks at the dashboard readouts

INSERT — DASHBOARD LED

The date on the “Destination time” is Saturday 3-19-1955 535 am and that matches
the date on ‘Present time” (“Last Time Departed” is 10—5 1985 111 am)

Below the “Plutonium Chamber” light flashes “EMPTY”

MARTY

He gets out of the car and picks it up

INSERT — NEWSPAPER 38

MARTY
This is definitely not my day

On the back of the newspaper is an AUTOMOBILE ADVERTISEMENT with a picture of a
“new” 1955 Studebaker The copy clearly says “YOULL BE NOTICED driving the car of
the future — the All New 1955 Studebaker”

Marty looks at the DeLorean looks again at the ad copy then looks at the garage door of
his house-to-be

MARTY
Why not

He tries to open the garage door it’s locked

Then he reaches in his pocket and pulls out his KEYS He tries one in the garage lock It
works Marty smiles and opens the garage door

ANGLE ON THE OPEN GARAGE — DAY 40
The DeLorean backs into the garage
Marty is about to turn off the car when he hears the RADIO DJ from the car radio
DJ
(VO RADIO)

And now one of the top records of the week

Marty turns up the volume he wants to hear this “Papa Loves Mambo” by Perry Como
starts playing Marty can’t believe what he is hearing He shakes his head

MARTY
This is nota good year

MUSIC BECOMES SCORE AND CONTINUES OVER NEXT SEQUENCE
EXT STREET IN FRONT OF MARTY’S (MODEL) HOME — MATTE SHOT — DAY 41

MARTY walks down the street toward Hill Valley He’s out of the radiation suit and in his
street clothes

CUT TO

EXT HILL VALLEY TOWN SQUARE — DAY 42

The town square is immediately recognizable because the courthouse clock tower is now
working In 1955 the town square is ahealthy vibrant center of commerce The same
buildings are well kept and clean and the street bustles with Saturday morning activity
Marty notices

THE MOVIE THEATER is now playing “Cattle Queen of Montana” starring Barbara
Stanwyck and Ronald Reagan

THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP is now a STUDEBAKER DEALERSHIP selling new 1955
cars

AN APPLIANCE STORE is selling “modern” small appliances
A WOMANS STORE displays tie latest fashions
A TRAVEL AGENCY advertises “Fabulous Vacations in Cuba”

THE BANK has a round clock instead of the digital version of 1985 A sign in the window
promotes “Passbook Savings at 2-14”

A RECORD STORE displays the latest records and albums Eddie Fisher Perry Como Pat

Boone There is no Rock and Roll

AN ELECTION POSTER “Re-elect Mayor Frank ‘Red’ Thomas Honesty Decency
Integrity” With the exception of the name and face it’s the same as the “Goldie Wilson”
poster of 1985

MARTY walks along tie street staring at the places and people The people stare at him
too particularly his green shoes

The previously boarded up CAFE is now open for business Marty notices a PUBLIC
TELEPHONE SIGN on the window he’s got an idea He enters

INT CAFE — DAY

A typical cafésoda fountain of the period 2 or 3 CUSTOMERS are at the counter

Marty stares at the signs advertising menu items Hamburger — 25 cents Ham and Cheese
— 30 cents Chocolate Sundae — 15 cents A sign over the cigarette display says “All
Brands 20 cents”

LOU the counterman spots Marty

LOU
Lookin’ for something kid

MARTY

Lou points it out in back a phone booth

MARTY
goes into the phone booth and flips through the directory

smiles — just what he was hoping for The sign on the phone says “Local Calls — 5 cents”
Marty digs out a nickel and dials the number It ringsand rings and rings No answer
He hangs up

MARTY
Not my day

He rips the page out
INT CAFE

Marty saunters out of the phone booth and takes a seat at the counter ANERDY
LOOKING KID is seated nearby sipping asoda and reading a comic book

Marty looks at Lou indicating the address on the phone book page

MARTY
Can you tell me where 1640 Riverside—

LOU
You gonna order something kid

MARTY
Uh yeah Gimme a Pepsi Free
LOU
Kid if you want a Pepsi you gotta pay for it

MARTY
No a Pepsi Free — you know diet soda

Lou looks at him like he’s from another planet

LOU
No don’t know

MARTY
Uh well just give me something to drink that doesn’t have sugar in it

Lou gives him a look then puts a cup of coffee in front of him Marty looks at the bowl of
sugar cubes in front of him

MARTY
Have you got any Sweet ‘N Low

LOU
Sweet and what
(eyeing him suspiciously)
Say kid youd better pay for this right now

MARTY
Okay

He pulls out his wallet and gives Lou a crisp new 20 dollar bill Lou’s eyes nearly fall out of
his head

LOU
A 20 What do you think this is a bank can’t break a 20 for a nickel cup
of coffee (suddenly suspicious) Say whats a kid your age doing with a 20
dollar bill anyway

Marty gulps pulls a nickel out of his pocket and takes back his 20 Lou gives him a look
then walks away

Marty raises his coffee cup and just as he’s about to take a sip

VOICE (08S)
Hey McFly

MARTY
Huh

He spins around on his stool

The voice came from a PUNK 17 behind him are 3 OTHER PUNKS The lead punk is
coming right toward Marty no he’s stepping over to the NERDY KID next to him

NERDY KID
Uh hi Biff how’s it going

Yes the punk is BIFF TANNEN aged 17 And the nerdy kid is GEORGE McFLY also 17
Biff takes Georges soda and drinks it all

Biff’s boys buy cigarettes at the counter They are MATCH perpetually chewing a wooden
matchstick SKINHEAD who has a crewcut just this side of being bald and 3-D who
always wears red-green 3-D glasses

Marty watches the exchange between Biff and George with utter amazement

BIFF

GEORGE

Biff knocks on George’s head

BIFF
Hello Anybody home Think McFly think I’ve gotta have time to recopy it

GEORGE

MARTY

A BLACK BUSBOY has been sweeping up in the background making his way over He
looks at George As he talks we see he has a gold front tooth — it’s GOLDIE WILSON
aged 22

GOLDIE
Say what do let that boy push you around for

GEORGE
Well uh he’s bigger than me

GOLDIE

GOLDIE
Mayor Thats a good idea could run for mayor

George slips out as the conversation continues

LOU
Ha A colored mayor Thatll be the day

GOLDIE

LOU
Just keep sweeping Goldie

Now Marty notices that George has left He goes out after him

But George doesn’t hear him He disappears around a corner
Marty runs after him

The homes evoke pleasant nostalgia front porches and white picket fences

MARTY comes from around the corner and sees GEORGES BIKE parked underneath a

tree Marty looks around then spots

GEORGE up in the tree precariously out on a branch overhanging the street about 12 feet
up George has a PAIR OF BINOCULARS trained on a second story window in the house

across the street
MARTY cant figure it out He moves closer for a better view

GEORGE focuses the binoculars

MARTY watches in disbelief as he realizes wnat George is doing

MARTY
Hes a peeping tom

as the girl moves closer to the window

GEORGE tries to move closer but loses his balance — he tumbles into the street
WIDER

MARTY watches as George groans then slowly tries to get up Now a CAR comes from
around the oorner

George doesn’t see it but Marty can see that it’s going to hit George

MARTY
Dad Look out

But George is still dazed Marty dashes into the street and in a spectacular flying leap
knocks him out of the path of the oncoming car

As Marty moves to avoid the car the car swerves in the SAME DIRECTION — theres a
screech of brakes and the car hits Marty

George never one to get involved grabs his bike and pedals off leaving Marty lying in the

street unconscious

MARTYS POV THRU THE WINDOW — BROWN’S LIVING ROOM 60-C

The PARTY is an eclectic collection of SOCIETY TYPES COLLEGE TYPES BEAT
GENERATION TYPES and lots of attractive WOMEN

Brown wanders over to the best looking WOMAN in the place Brown whispers into her ear
She responds by hitting him in the head with a BEER BOTTLE Brown goes down dazed

She walks off in a huff

Brown rubs his head then his eyes open wide in the same crazed expression we ve seen
in 1985

BROWN
Of course Of course It’s so obvious
(jumps to his feet shouts)
All right the party’s over Everybody go home have work to do
The guests exchange looks

BROWN
Go home Everybody out need quiet

Some of the guests begin to leave

64 INT BROWN’S GARAGEWORKSHOP — NIGHT 64
Its a large closed garage witha PACKARD CONVERTIBLE and a large work area

organized and well-kept
A clock shows the time is 1245

BROWN is hunched over his workbench furiously scribbling down notes and plans He’s
disheveled — he’s been here for a while

Browns DOG is sitting near its “bed” The name on the dog dish is “COPERNICUS”
Copernicus suddenly reacts to something

MARTY appears at a partially open WINDOW He opens it the rest of the way and climbs

in
MARTY
Doc listen you gotta hear me out—
BROWN
Get lost kid I’m working
MARTY

know And know what youre doing — youre inventing time travel It

came to you in a vision when you got hit over the head with that beer bottle

And that thing youre drawing is the TFC — the Temporal Field Capacitor
Brown is totally astonished

BROWN
My God How did you know that

MARTY
told you — Im from the future

With that he walks over to the garage door and raises the overhead door revealing THE
DELOREAN sitting there in the driveway

Browns mouth falls open as he stares at it — and the mechanism visible through the open
gull wing door He grabs the DRAWING he’s been working on and runs over to the
DeLorean to compare it
Its a DRAWING OF TIE TFC It matches the real thing perfectly
CUT TO
65 INT BROWN’S GARAGE — A LITTLE LATER — NIGHT 65
The DeLorean is now in the garage the garage door is closed The 1985 suitcase is open

and we can see its contents — clothes toilet articles and a CONAIR (battery) HAIR
DRYER
MARTY is busily attaching the video camera into a 1953 model TV

MARTY
Okay Doc Take a look at this

Brown comes over and Marty rolls the tape he shot in the mall parking lot where Brown is
explaining the operation of the time machine

Brown is amazed to see himself as a man of 65

BROWN
Why — that’s me I’m an old man Incredible Thank God I’ve still got my
hair baldness runs in my family you know But what on earth am
wearing

MARTY
A radiation suit

BROWN
Of course because of all the fallout from the Atomic wars And whats that
thing around my neck

MARTY
Indian jewelry

BROWN
I’m not even gonna ask

66 ON TV 66

The part of the tape comes up about the Plutonium We see the image of the Plutonium
cannister with old Dr Brown next to it

MARTY
(VO tape)
Plutonium You mean this sucker’s nuclear

OLD BROWN
(on TV)
Electrical But need a nuclear reaction to generate the 121 jigowatts of
electricity need

67 YOUNG BROWN is taken aback 67
BROWN
121 JIGOWATTS Kid youre outta gas going no place fast
MARTY
Huh
BROWN

Look I’m sure that in 1985 plutonium is available in any corner drug store
But in 1955 it’s a little hard to come by And unless you figure on driving out
into a nuclear test site while an A-bomb’s going off Im afraid youre stuck
here

MARTY
But isn’t there some other way to generate that kind of power

BROWN
121 jigowatts Oh sure We can tie into Hoover Dam with a very long
cable Or we build a turbine on the back of this thing and you can drive it
over Niagara Falls Or you can drive across the country at 88 miles an hour
and hope that you get struck by a bolt of lightning

MARTY
Lightning Hold the phone Doc — check this out

Marty pulls out the “Save the Clock Tower” flyer from his pocket (with it is the mysterious
“headless snapshot” we saw earlier) Marty shows the flyer to Brown

INSERT — FLYER 68

It includes a photocopy of a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE dated March 27 1955 with a picture
of the clock tower stopped at 1002” The headline “CLOCK TOWER STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING CLOCK STOPPED AT 1002”

BACK TO SHOT 69
Brown reads it nodding He’s getting an idea

BROWN
Kid if this is true we just might be able to get your ass back to the future
It’s totally insane but it’s certainly no crazier than building a nuclear reactor
onto the back of a car According to this we know the exact moment
lightning will strike a specific spot — at 1002 pm and 11 seconds on next
Saturday All have to do is rig up a conducting system thatll channel the
lightning directly into the TFC As long as youre doing 88 miles an hour
when it happens See you later alligator

But Marty isn’t paying attention He’s looking at the snapshot again and he’s quite
concerned

BROWN
Whats wrong kid

MARTY
don’t know but something weird is going on with this picture My brother —
he’s fading out

BROWN
Lemme see that

Brown studies it He too reacts with concern
INSERT — SNAPSHOT 70
Indeed more of Dave has faded away — his neck is gone along with part of his shoulders

BACK TO SHOT 71

MARTY
It looks like he’s being erased or something

BROWN
Erased from existence

Kid — weve gotta get you some new clothes

EXT HILL VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL — DAY 72

Hill Valley High looks pretty much the same in 1955 but with a little less graffiti There is
not much activity in front — school is in session

BROWN’S PACKARD pulls up and DR BROWN and MARTY get out

Marty is now dressed in total 1955 period garb He and Brown ascend the school steps
Marty seems unsure confused

MARTY
Are you sure about this

BROWN
Figure it out kid Your old man was supposed to get hit by your Grandpas
car not you — therefore you interfered in your parents’ first meeting If they
don’t meet they don’t fall in love if they don’t fall in love they don’t get
married if they don’t get married they don’t have kids Thats why your
older brother’s fading out — he’s being erased from existence He’s first
since he’s the oldest Your sister’ll be next and then you unless you
repair the damage by getting your folks back together Once you introduce
‘em to each other nature will take its course

Marty pauses to check his reflection in the windowed door He combs back his slicked
down hairin a ducktail only to get a handful of “greasy kid stuff”

MARTY
can’t believe you actually put this crap in your hair

BROWN
Come on kid let’s get this over with

As GEORGE walks down the hall students laugh at him behind his back and some of the
boys kick him in the ass

George turns He has a “KICK ME“ sign hooked on his collar DR BROWN shakes his
head at this pathetic sight

BROWN
(to Marty)
Are you sure youre not adopted

Now a hand yanks George by the arm MR STRICKLAND — and he looks exactly the
same Marty is amazed

STRICKLAND
McFly Shape up man

He pulls the sign off Georges shirt and shows it to him

STRICKLAND
Youre a slacker Do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life

George shakes his head unconvincingly

Marty and Brown look down the hall in the opposite direction where
LORRAINE is at her locker giggling with a girl friend

George has run off in the opposite direction Marty stands in the middle of the hall
completely bewildered

Brown joins him

MARTY
She didn’t even look at him

BROWN
Obviously you being in the picture is areal distraction for her Youve got to
get him to ask her out on a date — so they can be alone together

MARTY
A date What kinda date don’t know what kids do in the 50s
BROWN
What do they do in the 80’s
MARTY
Sex and drugs and rock ‘n roll
BROWN

No comment kid

Brown notices a hand-painted banner in the hall announcing the “Enchantment Under The
Sea Dance” this Saturday night

BROWN
Look — there’s a dance coming up Get him to take her to that

Marty sees the sign and has a revelation

George looks at his “script” and mouths the words to himself He gets up his nerve and
approaches Lorraine Despite his awkwardness and fear there’s something endearing
about him like alost dog

Marty drops his head in his hands and sighs

BIFF
Well it’s gonna cost you McFly How much money you got on you

It’s an incredibly steep hill and at the bottom is a
railroad crossing Marty accelerates and he coasts down Now Biff’s convertible shoots
onto Hill Street actually lifting off the ground as it comes over the hill

Biff drives like hell after Marty and he’s closing fast Then Marty drops into a crouch cuts
his wind resistance and speeds away

AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING

the warning bells start ringing and the gate begins to lower
Marty reacts with fear

A Diesel Freight is approaching

The gate drops all the way down

Biff speeds up to stay on Marty’s tail

Marty has no choice — he vaults over the crossing gate and lands back on his
“skateboard” crossing the tracks just inches in front of the barreling Diesel

Biff slams on his brakes His wheels lock up and rubber SCREECHES across the
pavement but nevertheless he CRASHES through the crossing gate coming to a stop
right at the edge of the tracks and the Diesel engine runs over his front bumper

Brown is shocked to hear what Marty has just told him

BROWN
What do you mean you said “yes”

MARTY
had to At least that way Ill know shell be there Now all Ive gotta do is
figure out some way to make her end up with George

BROWN
Youre not gonna have much time kid Youve gotta make everything
happen by 930 — 945 at the latest — because youve gotta beat it back to
the courthouse square in time for the fireworks

Come here Ill show you the set-up

Brown takes him over to a CRUDE PLYWOOD TABLETOP MODEL of Hill Valley town
square which he’s constructed himself

A “lightning rod” (a nail) has been attached to the top of the “clock tower” (a piece of wood
with a watch strapped around it) A wire runs down from the “lightning rod” across “town
square” and between two “lamp posts” (candles in candlesticks) across the “street”

Brown explains the layout to Marty

BROWN
We put a lightning rod on the clock tower and we run some industrial
strength electrical cable from the lightning rod across the street
Meanwhile we ‘ve outfitted your car with a big hook directly connected into
the TFC

Brown brings out a wind-up toy car with a wire sticking straight up from the back Theres a
hook on the top of it (There is a similar rig on the real DeLorean visible in the
background) Brown winds up the toy car

BROWN

(continuing)
On a signal youll take off down the street toward the cable accelerating to
88

Brown releases the toy car from one end of the model toward the strung wre

He picks up a STRIPPED WIRE plugged into the AC outlet and brings it toward the
“lightning rod”

BROWN
(continuing)
Lightning strikes electrifying the cable just in time to

He touches the live wire to the nail The toy car’s antenna snags the cable SPARKS FLY
and the toy car catches FIRE It flies off the table top into some drapes and they catch fire
as well

Brown grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER and puts everything out Marty shakes his head

MARTY
Youre instilling me with a lot of confidence here Doc
BROWN
Don’t worry Ill take care of the lightning You just take care of your old

man

GEORGE seems very bewildered about what MARTY has been trying to explain to him

GEORGE
still don’t understand How can go to the dance with her if she’s going
with YOU
MARTY

She wants to go with YOU George — she just doesn’t know it yet That’s
why weve gotta convince her that youre not a chicken — so shell realize
that

Now come on hit me in the stomach Right here go ahead
Marty makes himself a target but George seems quite unwilling In the background a
homemade body bag (a duffel bag filled with clothes) is hanging from a clothesline pole

GEORGE
don’t want to hit you in the stomach
MARTY
Youre not gonna hurt me Just give me a punch
GEORGE
Look Im not a fighter
MARTY

How many times do have to explain it to you We know youre not a
fighter You know it know itbut she doesn’t know it Thats why weve
gotta make you look like a fighter somebody wholl stand up for her
somebody wholl protect her And youre not gonna look like a fighter if you
cant hit me in the stomach

GEORGE
But Ive never picked a fight in my life

MARTY
Youre not picking a fight youre coming to her rescue Maybe wed better

EXT TOWN SQUARE CLOCK TOWER — NIGHT
It’s a few minutes before 8 oclock

We hear a RADIO WEATHER FORECAST as the CAMERA takes us from the lightning rod
atop the clock tower along the cable strung down across the square to the STREET
where Browns Packard is parked nearby — the weather report emanates from the car
radio

BROWN is ona ladder he’s connecting the paddle plug end of the clock tower cable to the
socket on an extension cable tied around a lamp post

The DeLorean is nearby covered with a tarp MARTY arrives dressed up for the dance

FORECASTER
(VO radio)
Area weather on this Saturday night An electrical storm in the vicinity will
bypass Hill Valley but we can expect continued cloudiness and some light
rain

Brown reacts to the weather report

BROWN
Kid are you sure about this storm

MARTY
Doc since when can a weatherman predict the weather — let alone the
future

Brown smiles He plugs in the cables then descends the ladder

BROWN
Right

(a beat)
You know kid well I’m gonna be sad to see you go Youve really made
a difference in my life — youve given me something to shoot for Just
knowing that I’m gonna live to see 1985 that Ill succeed in this that Ill
get a chance to travel through time well it’s just gonna be hard for me to
wait 30 years before we can talk about everything that’s happened in the
past few days I’m gonna really miss you

Marty is particularly uncomfortable knowing the fate of Dr Brown

MARTY
Yeah uh Doc about the future

BROWN
No kid Weve already agreed that having knowledge of the future can be
extremely dangerous Even if your intentions are good it could backfire
drastically Whatever it is you want to tell me Ill find out through the natural
course of time

This is not what Marty wanted to hear but he can see there’s no arguing with Brown

MARTY
(sighs)
Yeah Listen Im gonna get a candy bar or something You want anything

Suddenly the drivers door is opened an arm reaches in yanks Marty out and Marty finds
himself face to face with
BIFF

Match 3-D and Skinhead are with him

BIFF

by Lorraine’s muffled screams

121 EXT SIDE OF SCHOOL 121

Skinhead Match and 3-D drag Marty around the corner to the side of the school where a
CADILLAC is parked with its trunk open

SKINHEAD
Hey — lets lock him in that trunk

They throw Marty into the car trunk and slam the lid shut Then the Cadillacs drivers door
is thrown open and the DRUMMER from the band steps out He’s smoking a reefer

DRUMMER

The other 3 car doors open and MARVIN BERRY and the OTHER BAND MEMBERS get

Biff’s boys exchange worried looks as the band members advance on them

SKINHEAD
Hey don’t want to mess with no reefer addicts

Biff’s boys take off (in the opposite direction from the Packard) but Marvin and the band
manage to kick ‘em all in the ass as they run away

Now we hear beating on the trunk from the inside and Martys muffled voice

MARTY ’S VOICE
Lemme out Lemme out

lets go with a TREMENDOUS LEFT HOOK SMACK INTO BIFF’S FACE

Biff hits the ground out cold

George can’t believe he did it He looks at his fist looks down at Biff and grins widely

LORRAINE
Oh George you were wonderful

She looks at him with adoring eyes
AT THE CADILLAC

Marvin has his screwdriver in the lock He gives it a hard jerk the trunk pops open but he
puts a big gash in his hand

Marty jumps out of the trunk

MARTY
Thanks a lot

He dashes back toward the Packard
MARTY
rushes onto the parking lot and is astonished to see GEORGE AND LORRAINE
EMBRACING and BIFF out cold on the ground He keeps his distance allowing them to

MARTY is turning pale He can barely stand up

MARTY

The band keeps on playing

GEORGE sees Dixon with Lorraine His anger rises and he strides over the them

Get lost jerk

He yanks Dixon away from Lorraine and shoves him hard sending him sprawling into the

color returns to his face and he looks at the snapshot

The pandemonium continues

Now Marty tears open his shirt and does some Elvis pelvis moves

Girls scream

Marty’s movements become Mick Jaggeresque then take on a Michael Jackson style
Finally he drifts into pure HEAVY METAL puts his guitar next to the amp making
FEEDBACK

This goes a little too far for 1955 musical tastes — the band stops playing and the kids
stop dancing They all watch Marty not sure what to think

Marty suddenly realizes he’s gone too far He smiles sheepishly and steps up to the
microphone

MARTY
Uh sorry you guys aren’t ready for that yet But your kids are gonna love it

He picks up the song again with the band They do one more chorus

Marty wraps up the song with a final riff and the students all go berserk with applause

At last the PACKARD pulls up across the street from the tarped DeLorean Marty jumps
out dressed in his 1985 clothes

BROWN
Youre late Do you have no concept of time

Brown pulls the tarp off the DeLorean and raises the “trolley hook” on back to its full height

MARTY
Take it easy Doc had to change my clothes Everythings cool — theyre
back togetherand heres the proof

Marty shows him the fully restored snapshot

MARTY
Yeah old George really came through Laid out Biff with one punch — cold

(continuing)
Ten minutes isn’t long enough for you to be missed Now Ive painted a
white line on the street up there — that’s where you start from

(continuing)
I’ve calculated the precise distance taking into account the acceleration
speed and wind resistance retroactive from the moment the lightning will
strike

He picks up a WIND-UP ALARM CLOCK
BROWN
(continuing)

When this alarm goes off you hit the gas

Brown gives it a wind then sets it on the DeLorean dashboard

Brown looks around then sighs

BROWN
Well guess that’s everything
Marty extends his hand
MARTY
Doc thanks for everything
They shake hands
BROWN

Thank YOU Ill see you in about 30 years
Marty sighs again thinking of Brown’s destiny and the letter

MARTY
I hope so

BROWN
Don’t worry As long as you hit that wire with this hook everything ’Il be fine

MARTY
Right

Brown puts his hands in his pockets and withdraws the letter Marty put there He looks at it
curiously Marty turns away

BROWN
Whats the meaning of this
MARTY
Youll find out in 30 years
BROWN
It’s about the future isn’t it Information about the future
MARTY
Youll find out in 30 years
BROWN

MARTY
Youve gotta take that risk Doc Your life depends on it

BROWN
(shakes his head)
No I’m not going to accept the responsibility
Brown tears up the envelope and shoves the pieces into the Packard ashtray

MARTY
All right Doc in that case Ill just have to tell you straight out—

But before Marty can get the words out a TREMENDOUS GUST OF WIND comes up
accompanied by a loud CRACK They turn A TREE LIMB in the square has blown down
right on top of the cable between the clock tower and the first lamp post

The paddle-plug attached to the lightning rod on the clock tower is yanked out and the
cable drops down from the clock tower

BROWN
Great Scott Kid — find the end of that cable — ’ll throw the rope down to
you
Brown grabs a big coil of rope and dashes into the courthouse

Marty gulps He takes a look at the fallen tree branch on the cable then goes hunting for
the end of it

The wind is picking up and the sound of THUNDER approaches

Brown almost loses his balance with the huge bells tolling so close He regains his footing
then pulls the rope up the rest of the way Hes got the paddle plug in hand

Brown yells at Marty but he can’t be heard over the bells Brown gestures that he’s got the
cable and that Marty should go

MARTY
hesitates but Brown gestures adamantly At last Marty nods and runs to the DeLorean

BROWN

unties the rope from the end of the paddle plug and looks up at its socket mate dangling on
the clock face He reaches up for it but he can’t quite get it He’ll have to move across the
ledge to get coser to it

Suddenly the ledge CRACKS and CRUMBLES beneath his feet Brown drops the cable
and grabs onto the CLOCK HANDS to save himself The cable drops onto his left foot

Brown hangs precariously from the clock face like Harold Lloyd wind blowing his hair and
lightning cracking in the sky

Brown carefully moves his right foot toward the intact section of ledge while trying to keep
the cable balanced on his left foot

His right foot moves closer at last it finds safe footing Brown takes a deep breath then
hops over onto the ledge

He kicks the cable up with his left foot and catches it in his hand

as MARTY arrives at the Mall He keeps onrunning past the entrance sign that reads
“LONE PINE MALL” (with an image of a single pine tree) into the parking lot just in time to
see a good 150 yards away

MARTY ’S POV OF

the Terrorist van chasing down Dr Brown — with Martys younger self watching frozen in
horror

MARTY
is both horrified and amazed — horrified at being too late amazed at seeing himself and
to be seeing something he’s already experienced from a third person point of view

MARTY
Oh God no I’m too late

HIS POV
The Terrorist leans out of the van with the machine gun

happened

MARTY

MARTY
Oh no

HIS POV

The Terrorist van turns and goes after the younger Marty Just as before Marty dives into
the DeLorean and roars off

MARTY
watches himself chased by the terrorists

HIS POV 221

The DeLorean accelerates even as it’s being shot at going faster and faster until it’s
enveloped in the BLINDING WHITE GLOW and vanishes

But the terrorist van drives into the white glow we hear cursing as the blinded driver loses
control of the van It swerves and goes out of control hitting a parking median and flipping
over on its side

MARTY 222
now runs toward the fallen Dr Brown lying face down in the parking lot

He reaches him along with EINSTEIN the faithful dog
Marty turns Brown over tears in his eyes

MARTY
Doc no

Suddenly BROWN OPENS HIS EYES and SMILES

Youre alive
Brown stands
BROWN

Brown tips open his radiation suit revealing a BULLET PROOF VEST

BROWN
It’s the latest fashion in personal protection Itll stop a slug from an
elephant rifle at 30 yards

MARTY
But how did you know

Brown smiles reaches into his pocket and pulls out the LETTER THAT MARTY WROTE
— SCOTCH TAPED TOGETHER Its yellow and brittle 30 years old

MARTY
(smiles shaking his head)
After all that lecturing about screwing up future events and the space-time
continuum

MARTY is on top of the bed asleep in his clothes Morning light streams in through the
bedroom window he stirs and opens his eyes He blinks several times as if getting his
bearings then sits up and looks around

Yes it’s his room all right and everything seems the same from the Z-28 posters to his
audio equipment

Marty looks at the clock 830 He looks at the wall calendar the first four days of October
are X’ed off — todayis the 5th Could it have all been a dream

He gets out of bed and looks at himself in the mirror then pinches himself to make sure
he’s real He is On the nightstand is a framed 5 x 7 version of the snapshot with he and
his siblings it looks the same

He reaches into his waste can and pulls out the SUBMISSION FORM TO THE RECORD

and puts it in the envelope with the form

why Marty is making such a big deal about this

SUZY

He pulls her toward him theyre about to kiss closer closer

And just as they kiss their HAIR STANDS UP ON END Martys eyes widen with the
inevitable expectation

We hear a SONIC BOOM and Marty turns — the DELOREAN STREAKS UP in front of the 233
house

DR BROWN 234
jumps out more wild-eyed and frantic than we ‘ve ever seen him His clothes are

particularly bizarre — a weird mixture of past and future a cowboy hat a strange variation

on a Roman tunic a cape and striped plastic pants
