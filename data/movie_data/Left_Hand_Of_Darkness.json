    "overview": "The piece is inspired by Le Guin's novel and by Vasulkas' lesson. A tribute to both of them. It looks like a drawing exercise but, recording in real time my left hand, the right hand was not holding a pencil but rather adjusting knobs and patching oscillators, of a Jones Raster Scan, similar to the Rutt Etra Scan Processor, but one of a kind built by Dave Jones for Sara Hornbacher. It looks easy, but it is not so comfortable, rather a process of prosthetization in which a very familiar part of the body becomes alien, sucked by the uncanny vortex of the machines, in which we believe to see a glimpse of creation, when two index fingers touch each others, but the triangulation ends up with a unsettling unity, summed up with an idiom, in Mandarin: 孤掌难鸣 meaning something like It’s hard to clap with only one hand.",
