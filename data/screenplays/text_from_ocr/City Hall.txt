noisily into the chamber but before she is fully inside she

the back of the room KEVIN CALHOUN 35 Chief Deputy
Mayor is a lanky deceptively sleepy-looking man a tall
drink of water who watches and listens closely to
everything his clothes don’t quite seem to fit him (he
would be more comfortable in sweater and jeans) but there
is an energy that radiates sexual dynamic and above all
intelligent

MAYOR (CONT’D)
Please walk abroad now my friends
in this fair city and recreate
yourselves And then return and
return again and again Goodbye for
now and adieu

Calhoun bends his ear to Angie’s mouth As she whispers

Well find out
CALHOUN Important but more
Where’s the probation report to the point who’s
going to give Eddie

a filledout form hands it to wife and children
Calhoun whose brow furrows) No forensic ex-

Questions

a ae et ee ee ee

ABE
Very good But there is a
conviction Criminal posses-
sion in the fourth degree

CALHOUN
A probational offense A 4-C
That’s practically a mis-
demeanor

ABE
There are 4-C’s and there are
4-C’s

(Abe turns the probation report
over and over checking it out
front and back)

CALHOUN
(to Abe)
--You keep looking at that as
if it were not kosher

ABE
A cut of meat is kosher A
piece of fish ‘Savory foods
and all kinds of dainties’
are kosher But a probation
report is not kosher It is
merely a probation report

(Calhoun measures Abe abruptly
he reaches up and MUTES the TV)

CALHOUN

(He nods to Sadler
of The Post)

SADLER (V0)
Why was Tino Zapatti out
on probation

MAYOR (V0)
I have not seen his
probation report
yet and I will not
speculate I do
know that Judge
Walter Stern is
perhaps the most
reputable jurist sit-
ting on the State Supreme
Court bench If the
probation report was good
what choice did he
have

SADLER (V0)
What choice did James Bone
have

(Yeah yeah what
choice reporters
crowding each other
interject raise
their hands “Over
here Mr Mayor

MAYOR (V0)
Mr Sadler James
Bone had no choice
Nor did Detective
Edward Santos
There is one thing
as Mayor I will never get
over the death of a
police offier And there
is one thing in life I
will never get over the
death of an
innocent child

Abe bends low over the report examining the words as if
they were lacunae in the Talmud

ABE (CONT’D)
A Probation Supervisor signed this
An Assistant Probation Supervisor
countersigned it

CALHOUN
So

ABE
That’s a lot of weight for a 4-C
Where was the original little
Probation Officer where’s his
signature
Calhoun snatches the report from Abe scans it tries to
fathom its meaning but can’t

CALHOUN
Surely there must be an explanation

ABE
‘The more flesh the more worms’

Calhoun glances at the television set above the Mayor is

May I have a seat

Schwartz doesn’t answer waits for Calhoun to sit

SCHWARTZ
I know why you’re here I’ve logged
- twelve calls already today Mr
Zapatti --

CALHOUN

Tha extra-specials

CALHOUN
Such as a Zapatti Family member

‘ SCHWARTZ
Something like that Look Mr
Deputy Mayor --

CALHOUN
Kevins good enough

SCHWARTZ
Any case comes in here that looks
like it’s ‘connected’ I take an
interest in --

CALHOUN
why

SCHWARTZ
To avoid making mistakes

CALHOUN
You made one on this one

SCHWARTZ
I blew it and I don’t mind admitting
it -But I’d rather blow one out of
a hundred than send ten men away on
mandatories who don’t deserve them

CALHOUN
You sound like an enlightened man
Mr Schwartz

‘SCHWARTZ
And you sound like youre fucking
with me

Calhoun sighs

CALHOUN
How do these things happen

SCHWARTZ
These things happen because we’re
drowning -- in criminals in half-
baked social workers ina city that
doesn’t function in a world that
doesn’t know right from wrong

More silence Calhoun finally stands

A moment

CALHOUN
So there was no probation officer on
this case

SCHWARTZ
Wrong You’re looking at him -

CALHOUN
But you’re a supervisor

SCHWARTZ
More precisely a Branch Officer

SCHWARTZ (CONTD)
Okay same thing We were
understaffed I always oversee files
that are flagged red

CALHOUN
This one you handled alone

SCHWARTZ
Yes I’m afraid so

Calhoun walks out meets up with Abe in the anteroonm

the good things of the earth flow
into the city because of its
greatness’ Well we were great
once and we could be great again
This is the ‘palace that was the
city’ but the city is no more when
a child’s body lies before us But
I pledge we will find obr spirit

The Mayor smiles
MAYOR
I am Greek man When I was James
Bone’s age I used to have to sit at
Easter services for two hours and
after that the Archbishop would pass
out eggs which had been dyed red for
the blood of Christ -- I loved those
red eggs My dad had one he kept
it in a glass case with an ivory
crucifix and a Jesus palm card for
thirty years Your ass gets hard in
those pews especially if there’s no
egg at the end of the line

MAYOR

‘Distance’ is shit Distance is
what you do to your enemies It’s an
invention of the 90’s to make
friends extinct

When I was a kid we used to go to
Vidalia they had a little Greek
Orthodox church there The
restaurant people and shoemakers
from Natchez across the river held
Sunday services but in the Spring
they’d put on this Greek Festival --
and I remember one time I won a
footrace and they had this little
stand they called Mount Olympus and
I stepped up on it and they laid a
laurel wreath on my head

HOLLY
There had to be someone else there

CALHOUN
If there were why didn’t Santos let
anybody else know

HOLLY
Because it was his collar He made
that case on Tino and then the judge
went south Eddie went crazy when
he heard that sentence I had to tie
him down in the hallway There is
no way Tino Zapatti could’ve walked
two years agounless interested

JUDGE STERN
Where are you going with this Mr
MacKenzie

CALHOUN

DEAN KERR

JUDGE STERN
And then what happens

DEAN KERR
You will fall into the water -- and
float onto another shore

JUDGE STERN
Of the disbarred and the disgraced

DEAN KERR
You’ve had a good run Walter You
know you were the best law student
I ever had There’s no way you’ll
ever be a disappointment to me

JUDGE STERN
Why are you being so kind

DEAN KERR
You didn’t know it was going to turn
out this way

JUDGE STERN
All I wanted was to do some good I
was tired of being the white-shoe
litigator Defending the
arbitrageurs and the 80’s go-go boys
-- and all it took was 50000 to
change my life Fifty-thousand and
the judgeship was mine I felt
honored there were lots of others
out there with the same 50000 but
the one they took was mine
Ridiculous isn’t it

DEAN KERR
Not at all --

JUDGE STERN
The law was pure I thought I’11
go back to the law But to get
there I paid with my blood --

DEAN KERR

As I said Walter it’s just another
shore It won’t be so strange once
you set foot on it

(a moment)
But I must ask you one question
When you went to hand the money over
to Anselmo --

JUDGE STERN
In a brown paper bag That was the
moment How should I folid the bag
Roll the top down like my mother did
for my baloney sandwich on a
basketball trip Or should I fold
it neatly Crumple it perhaps --

DEAN KERR
Stop Walter
JUDGE STERN
That was what did me in The bag
was the River Styx when I filled it
I was on my way to the other side
No turning back

DEAN KERR
The first bite’ as they say

JUDGE STERN
Tell me what to do

DEAN KERR
Make a clean breast Call the
District Attorney who is it anyway
these days

JUDGE STERN
Harry Barclay

DEAN KERR

And then

MAYOR
A short sojourn in Albany to be
followed by a long one in The White
House

Calhoun smiles looks around

CALHOUN
Is it just you and me here right
now--
MAYOR

You bet Pappy
‘4

Silence

CALHOUN
I want to tell you that if I didn’t
know you I would be bursting with
admiration I thought I’d come here
to find you on your knees -- instead
I see you ready to turn adversity
into triumph

MAYOR
Then you still believe in me

CALHOUN
You’re Mayor Boss and Father rolled
into one

MAYOR
Where is your father

CALHOUN
These days In a nursing home in
Crowley He plays dominoes with the
orderlies And fulminates over his
oatmeal

MAYOR
Don’t be too hard on him We can’t
dictate our finishes

CALHOUN
I don’t like the sound of that

MAYOR
Why should you Because under all
that need to believe all that
concrete you’ve poured into my
pedestal way down in the deepest
reaches of your destroyed
Confederate soul something is
struggling to cry out

CALHOUN
What

MAYOR
You know I made that phone call to
Walter Stern

More silence

bee eeee cee ete ee

MAYOR (CONT’D)
Frank called me And I knew who had
called him But in this business
you never trade names Then I
called Walter -- he said there was
nothing he could do with the
probation report he had in front of
him I asked him what would happen
if we got him another probation
report

Silence again

A moment

MAYOR (CONT’D)
And that’s all there was to it A
little favor I’ve been running
caution lights all my life --

CALHOUN
But this time you ran a red
Someone cut across the inter-
section A cop and a six-year-old
child -

MAYOR
That’s with me forever

CALHOUN
-- Not good enough John

MAYOR
It scares me when you call me
‘John’

CALHOUN
Yeah Why

MAYOR
Because when we were taking that
trip to the White House a few
moments ago I felt you come on
board The old menschkeit

CALHOUN
Horseshit Menschkeit is horseshit
You ought to carry it out of the
barn and spread it over the fields

‘And if we all cross our fingers and

get a lot of rain maybe a flower
will grow

“A terrible moment the Mayor leans ‘towards Calhoun

f

Ae ee nee eee tee -

MAYOR
That’s you Out of all of this
crap maybe you’ll emerge Don’t
you see you’re the only voter I
ever cared about A constituency of
one

CALHOUN
I’m getting the con feeling John
the old copping of a plea --

MAYOR
No plea No nothing Just a pol
who kept rolling along - until he
ran into a stone wall I don’t know
what it was that stopped me What
is it you said ‘Confederate honor’
An old Southern boy’s sense of
justice The pain of it was
whatever it was in you it reminded
me of myself when I was young
Ambitious a go-getter but fair

(after a moment)

Then somehow one day the line got
rubbed out in me

He opens a curtain the room is downstairs the trees of
Gracie Park branch out over the high-rises looming above

The Mayor

The Mayor

CALHOUN
Don’t indulge yourself

turns back to him

MAYOR
What do you mean

CALHOUN
You’re going to take yourself out
waits

CALHOUN (CONT‘D)
A long vacation in Greece Pick up
the law again maybe catch on with
some international firm in Rome Go
the way of Bill O’Dwyer he
succeeded LaGuardia fucked up and
played Ambassador to Mexico

MAYOR
I’m not that ambitious --
ow

oe ne ae ee ee

CALHOUN
Then suck it up and find some other
way

Calhoun closes the window closes the curtain faces the
Mayor

MAYOR
Why are you doing this

CALHOUN
Because I love you

A moment

Calhoun smiles

MAYOR (CONT’D)
I thought I’d see a son’s tears
instead I feel a man’s spine

The Mayor embraces Calhoun

MAYOR (CONT’D)
You’ve got the stuff Pappy I love
to see it in a guy

He goes

joys of this fair city and the
aspirants those who come to make
their mark in the arts or the
professions or politics That’s me
