Synopsis

After everything in her life falls to pieces including her marriage to wealthy businessman Hal
(Alec Baldwin) elegant New York socialite Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) moves into her sister
Ginger’s (Sally Hawkins) modest apartment in San Francisco to try to pull herself back together

again

Jasmine arrives in San Francisco in a fragile mental state her head reeling from the cocktail of
anti-depressants she’s on While still able to project her aristocratic bearing Jasmine is
emotionally precarious and lacks any practical ability to support herself She disapproves of
Ginger’s boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) who she considers another “loser” like Ginger’s
ex-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) Ginger recognizing but not fully understanding her
sister’s psychological instability suggests that she pursue interior design a career she correctly
intuits that Jasmine won’t feel is beneath her In the meantime Jasmine begrudgingly accepts
work as the receptionist in a dentist’s office where she attracts the unwanted attentions of her

boss Dr Flicker (Michael Stuhlbarg)

Feeling that her sister might be right about her poor taste in men Ginger starts seeing Al (Louis
CK) a sound engineer whom she considers as a step up from Chili Jasmine sees a potential
lifeline when she meets Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard) a diplomat who is quickly smitten with her

beauty sophistication and style

Jasmine’s flaw is that she derives her worth from the way she’s perceived by others while she
herself is blind to what is going around her Delicately portrayed by a regal Cate Blanchett
Jasmine earns our compassion because she is the unwitting instrument of her own downfall
Woody Allen’s new drama BLUE JASMINE is about the dire consequences that can result when

people avert their eyes from reality and the truth they don’t want to see

About the Production

Throughout his career Woody Allen has created many indelible female characters portrayed by
some of the world’s greatest actresses including Diane Keaton Geraldine Page Mariel
Hemingway Charlotte Rampling Mia Farrow Barbara Hershey Gena Rowlands Dianne Wiest
Mira Sorvino Judy Davis Samantha Morton Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz to mention
only a few Whether they appear in light comedies dark dramas or anything in between these
complex female characters resonate in our memories as the focal points of his movies Certain to
take her place in this gallery of multifaceted complex and richly observed women is Jasmine
the troubled heroine of Allen’s new drama BLUE JASMINE portrayed by another one of the

world’s most extraordinary actresses Cate Blanchett

We first meet New York socialite Jasmine shortly after she has suffered a breakdown triggered
by the cataclysmic collapse of her marriage to wealthy financier Hal (Alec Baldwin) Up until
that point Jasmine’s entire identity was wrapped up in being an elegant well dressed culturally
sophisticated woman living the Manhattan high life but now that life is over and her mental and
emotional state is rapidly veering off course ““We know from the minute the movie opens that
Jasmine is lost” says Allen ““She’s already someone who has been found talking to herself and
has had real problems” Hitting rock bottom both financially and psychologically and having
nowhere else to go Jasmine turns to her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) a grocery store cashier in
San Francisco “Jasmine has really been through the mill” says Allen “In a fit of anger she did
something that caused dire consequences she never anticipated and she brought on herself an
extremely potent series of traumas” Says Blanchett “Jasmine is in freefall and has to leave
behind everything she knows and has expected She’s entering the realm of absolute unknown

moving from one coast to the other from one social set to the other one class to another”

Jasmine wasn’t born into wealth she met and married Hal a handsome high-flying
businessman when she was a college student Hal quickly transported her to a world of high
fashion clothes precious jewelry elegant dinner parties beach houses and private planes “She

was captivated” says Allen “Hal was good looking charming successful dynamic and wealthy
and he swept her off her feet She changed her direction and suddenly found herself leading the
life of a wealthy wife—and she got used to it” Blanchett feels that marrying into money wasn’t a
completely unexpected path for Jasmine to take in her life as she might always have had a vision
of a handsome prince who would come to take her away “To get a job and forge your own way
in life you have to be able to weather the knockbacks that life deals out to you and I don’t know
if Jasmine is like that For her to have to roll up her sleeves and get her hands dirty by taking a

job is probably not in her ideal picture of the universe”

Hal portrayed by Alec Baldwin is a man whose fortune is as bountiful as the source of his
income is questionable “I think Hal is like a million guys out there who have this big shot
complex” says Allen “They make a lot of money and they’re charming and generous with
people They stay just within the law when they can and when they have to stretch it a little they
stretch it” Hal is also equally flexible in his attitudes towards fidelity “I think Hal is like a lot of
hard-charging successful men who feel the need to take the edge off of a stressful life and expect
their wives to understand” says Baldwin “In his case Jasmine isn’t able to accept that but he is
very adept at reassuring her that she has nothing to worry about” Says Allen “For Hal Jasmine
is elegant and knows how to keep up the social end of things and yet he’s always playing around

because he’s good looking and dynamic and that’s his style”

Born with the name Jeanette Jasmine took on her more poetic moniker around the time Hal
came into her life “It’s quite a theatrical choice” says Blanchett “and it’s very telling that she
didn’t call herself Scarlett or something completely different—she always steps slightly
sideways from the truth Small fantasies like this are harmless in of themselves but the more you
do it the further you get away from reality” Blanchett continues “This leads to the question ‘Is
Jasmine predisposed to being a fantasist or is she a fantasist through circumstance’ I think
there’s a certain type of person who has a more fragile makeup and a less tangible grip on reality

and Jasmine probably is in that camp”

Arriving in San Francisco Jasmine is dismayed to see Ginger’s modest apartment and lifestyle
so completely different than what she is accustomed to Adding to her discomfort is the fact that

her relationship with her sister has always been complicated Jasmine and Ginger were adopted
children from different parents and from the beginning Jasmine was the favored child bathed in
love of which Ginger received very little “Jasmine had this golden aura around her” says Sally
Hawkins (HAPPY-GO-LUCKY) who plays Ginger “She was brighter and prettier and more
elegant from birth Ginger saw herself as the lesser child and the one who wasn’t really liked—
sort of the runt of the litter” The impact of the different treatments they received as children
created a degree of tension between the two of them early on as well as two very contrasting
viewpoints of life Jasmine grew up with a sense of entitlement and found Hal to give her the life
she felt she deserved whereas Ginger had very modest expectations but developed the robust
strength and skills to make it on her own Her approach to life was always more hands-on She
bartended and waited tables married a rough-hewn handyman named Augie (Andrew Dice Clay)
with whom she had two boys When Jasmine on the other hand was forced by circumstance to
work in a fancy shoe store in New York it was devastating for her to be seen by women she had
previously socialized with “Her focus on the outward appearance or what the neighbors will
think has probably led her to the state that you find her in when she hits San Francisco” says
Blanchett “She fled because she was feeling judged by others She is very conscious of how
she’s perceived and her desire to control that perception the outward shell of who she is trumps

the discovery of who she actually is”

The sisters have lived in two completely different worlds for most of their adult lives but now
that Jasmine needs her help Ginger willingly takes her in “Ginger would never be close to her
like she would a sister with a loving background” says Allen “but their situation isn’t so cold
that when Jasmine’s in trouble she would turn a completely blind eye” Says Hawkins “I don’t
think Ginger could ever turn Jasmine away Ginger is really kind and even though there’s great
tension there As the younger sister she has always looked up to Jasmine and now sees the
opportunity to have a real connection with her” Unfortunately by the time of her arrival
Jasmine may be too far gone for Ginger to be able to reach “Ginger does try but she just doesn’t
know where to begin to unlock Jasmine” says Hawkins “She’s so trapped in a different world
that Ginger doesn’t really understand that Ginger has no grasp of how to get to her” Trying to
be helpful Ginger suggests that Jasmine pursue interior design a profession which would allow
for her to express her cultivation and taste Jasmine is enthusiastic but comes up with the highly

impractical idea that she take an online course even though she can’t use a computer “Her ideas
are ill thought through but she’ll throw everything at them” says Blanchett “TI think the thing

that’s relatable and humanizes her is the panic that underlies that”

Jasmine does have enough lucidity to try to convince Ginger to break up with her mechanic
boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) “Jasmine thinks her sister’s first husband Augie (Andrew
Dice Clay) was a loser” says Allen “As any good sister or friend would do she’s advising her
not to fall into the same trap again picking another guy who has no refinement whatsoever”
Clay feels that Jasmine doesn’t give Augie a fair chance “He may be an ordinary working class
guy but he really loved his wife I think Jasmine doesn’t like Augie because she’s all about
money and jewelry and how much money the guy she’s with has” Blanchett sees some truth in
that appraisal “Jasmine is someone who has pinned all of her ability to rise up in the world upon
being connected to the right man believing that it’s about who you attach yourself to not
through any of your own agency How could you ever rise up if you’re connected to the wrong
man It’s very revealing about the way she sees her own ability to move and shake in the world”
Says Hawkins “Ginger is very aware of Jasmine’s distaste for the men in her life That pains her
but she also feels that maybe she’s right There’s a part of Ginger that wants to better herself At
the same time she’s confused and thinking that she should be looking for someone better just

because she wants to make a better connection with Jasmine”

Chili recognizes very quickly the threat that Jasmine’s arrival poses for his relationship with
Ginger “As soon as Jasmine gets there he can see that Ginger is changing” says Cannavale
“He understands that she’s very susceptible to Jasmine and the stakes are high for him It’s
obviously very important for him to fight for Ginger because he’s very much in love with her”
Unfortunately Chili’s attempts to hold onto Ginger are expressed in explosive acts that only
serve to confirm Jasmine’s low opinion of him Says Allen “Even though he makes a scene in
the apartment and in the grocery store where she works he’s not a villain he feels he loves her
and to the best of his ability he’s trying His heart’s in the right place but I don’t know what will
happen in future years” Cannavale believes Chili sees Ginger as someone who is very easily
manipulated and he has taken it upon himself to look out for her ““He’s a very natural sort of
protector” he says “He’s interested in giving her unadulterated love a real physical kind of guy

who’s vulnerable too I think she needs that from him and he needs somebody to protect”
To make money for her computer classes Jasmine takes a stopgap job as a receptionist at the
office of dentist Dr Flicker (Michael Stuhlbarg) work that she finds highly beneath her and
which she is ill-suited to do To make matters worse things quickly become awkward between
Jasmine and her employer “On the surface Dr Flicker might appear to be generous to Jasmine
but he has an ulterior agenda” says Stuhlbarg “He wants something from her” It soon becomes
clear what that is as he clumsily and inappropriately tries to come on to her ignoring her highly
distressed state “He’s not really paying attention to what she’s going through” says Stuhlbarg
“His desires blind him to what she’s going through” No matter how much she resists he only
becomes more aggressive and insistent “By the time Jasmine finds herself at the dentist’s office
she’s really beginning to be in freefall because nothing is working out” says Blanchett “It’s like
they’re speaking Swahili in these computer classes and if she can’t learn the computer then she
can’t study interior design and then she’s got no other ideas She has no money no skills and

she’s clearly on the verge of outstaying her welcome at Ginger’s place”

An unexpected potential lifeline turns up for Jasmine when she goes to a party and meets Dwight
(Peter Sarsgaard) a genteel diplomat who takes an interest in her “Dwight is very ambitious and
wants to go into politics” says Sarsgaard “Based on how Jasmine looks and the way she’s
dressed and acts he sees her as the kind of woman who would really be an asset for his political
plans But what draws him to her is a certain nervousness and vulnerability that she has She’s
not comfortable with herself and that makes her easier for him to approach—I don’t know if he
would have done it otherwise” Not wanting to fill Dwight in on the calamity of her recent
months she quickly invents a much more upbeat and elevated persona for herself “She’s able to
lie” say Allen “She’s saying I’m a decorator and my late husband was a surgeon She has a
certain built in elegance in her persona and from years of social activity and upper-class social
interaction she puts on a good show and he’s not looking for or suspecting any lies” Says
Blanchett “I think Jasmine has so little faith in her own abilities that she has to make herself
more than what she is constantly It’s an instinctual response she doesn’t think things through
And once those words come out of her mouth she can’t put them back in—she just has to keep
going The truth is often very terrifying particularly when you’ve spent your entire life in a

fiction”
At the same party where Jasmine encounters Dwight Ginger meets Al (Louis CK) who has a
more upscale job and a sweeter manner than the men she’s used to going out with Even though
he is only modestly above the level of what she’s used to she sees him as a step up “Al is a guy
living a kind of drab life where he’s fixing people’s audio systems” says Louis CK “and he’s
trying to trying to find some happiness by carving out a little romance with this very innocent
and nice young woman He’s got a very simple way of paying attention to her and showing that
he likes her and it makes her feel really good” Says Hawkins “Ginger has aspirations for a
better life and thinks that Al is the solution It’s like she’s playing a role—she’s really liking this
world that Al seems to offer He’s showing her a life that could be better than what she sees her

life to be”

As is always the case Allen assembled a stellar cast for BLUE JASMINE toplined by Cate
Blanchett who was his first choice to play Jasmine “Cate is one of the great actresses of the
world” says Allen “She just has that thing There’s a tremendous amount of depth there
There’s no way to quantify it You can get other actresses who are very good and they’Il be
playing frustration and despair and they’1l weep the way Cate does but for some reason she
projects on the screen a tremendous depth that sucks you in You just feel how deep she’s going

and that’s her gift”

Blanchett was very enthusiastic about working with Allen and the screenplay but she also found
Jasmine to be a particularly daunting role to play A lot of the challenge for her involved the way
the script cuts back and forth between the San Francisco present and the New York past The
New York sections don’t just provide the backstory for the present they mirror and parallel what
is going on For example as Jasmine arrives at her sister’s cramped place the film cuts to her in
an enormous empty Fifth Avenue apartment “Because Jasmine is such an unreliable narrator
the flashbacks are there to find out what’s truly going on underneath the surface” says Blanchett
“In a way I wish we’d shot the New York stuff first before we’d gone to San Francisco because
it was in doing that that I sort of fully understood her character” Blanchett continues “I did go
in every day and say to myself ‘Don’t screw this up’ ‘Can you please not screw it up today’”
On the set she discovered that Allen was willing to give her an unusually large amount of

freedom think he really doesn’t want to get in an actor’s way” she says “and that’s something
Thad to sort of deprogram myself from because I love the suggestions that come from directors
So I just kept asking him questions and he’d answer them Most of my questions were about
tone because when you’re working with the director who made BANANAS and INTERIORS
you can read this script and think it’s terribly tragic and painful and there’s another way you can
read it where it’s just absurd I think he’s a master at that people who are completely immersed

in the seriousness of their own lives—which are utterly absurd”

Having enjoyed working with Sally Hawkins on CASSANDRA’S DREAM where she played
Colin Farrell’s girlfriend Allen thought she would be a great choice for the pivotal role of
Jasmine’s sister Ginger “She’s a fabulous actress” he says “She’s real all the time she’s never
actressy” Hawkins has high praise for Allen’s no-nonsense directing style “Woody doesn’t
want to deal with chit chat He just wants you to turn up and for your character to be fully
formed and ready to work” As a long-time admirer of Cate Blanchett’s work Hawkins was
thrilled at the opportunity to play her sister “Cate has no ego” she says “She just wants to
investigate life create incredibly rich layers and make the work as good as it possibly can be I
believed every single moment of her as Jasmine and being so close to it just saw this woman
completely trapped and lost and alone It was a highly tuned performance—it’s like the strings
on a guitar being tightened tightened tightened until she snapped I can’t imagine how difficult
it must have been to take that character home with you at night” Says Blanchett “Sally’s got the

biggest heart of anyone I’ve ever met I clung to her like a life raft”

Alec Baldwin makes his third appearance in a Woody Allen film after ALICE and TO ROME
WITH LOVE portraying Jasmine’s well-heeled entrepreneurial husband Hal “Alec is the
perfect guy to play Hal because he’s got everything going for him” says Allen “He’s good
looking he’s a tremendously talented dramatic actor and yet if you need somebody to be funny
he can be funny” Playing Dwight Hal’s counterpart as a wealthy and refined suitor for
Jasmine’s attention is Peter Sarsgaard (AN EDUCATION) “Peter projects intelligence and
literacy as well as a sweetness that makes him a guy you root for Jasmine to wind up with
somebody who would come into her life and under other circumstances really save her” On the
other side Jasmine receives highly inappropriate and unwelcome attentions from her employer

Dr Flicker played by Michael Stuhlbarg star of the Coen Brothers’ A SERIOUS MAN and

currently portraying racketeer Arnold Rothstein on HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire” “Michael is a
very natural actor which I like” says Allen “It never looks like he is acting which is the best

kind of acting He also can be funny and serious with great effectiveness”

Allen had seen Bobby Cannavale’s work on the New York stage and he felt the actor would be a
perfect match for the character of Chili “Bobby can do all kinds of things but he’s very good at
playing this kind of character which is his natural persona” says Allen “He just seemed a
natural for the part plus he has a built-in likability” Foul-mouthed comedian Andrew Dice Clay
might not seem an obvious choice for a dramatic role as Ginger’s hapless ex-husband Augie but
Allen had his eye on Clay for a long time “I always thought Andrew could be a wonderful actor
in the right circumstances” says Allen “He’s a great type and he’s got a wonderful quality He’s
a guy who not only does the written lines you give him but he builds the character himself He

adds things never in a pushy way but in a creative way”

Portraying Al the third man in Ginger’s life is Louis CK one of America’s most beloved
comedians and the creator of the Emmy-winning series “Louie” “Louis is very funny and that
accounts for the success he’s having as a comedian but he’s also got another dimension to him
where he’s not just a guy who writes or buys a million jokes and stands up and just shoots them

off” says Allen “ He’s got a depth or pathos about him and that makes him very sympathetic”

Given Jasmine’s emotional state BLUE JASMINE might seem an apt title “At first we named it
“Jasmine French” says Allen “but then because of the score we felt BLUE JASMINE best
characterized the mood of the picture” Jasmine also references “Blue Moon” several times as
the song that was playing when she met Hal—a tune whose famous lyric “you saw me standing

alone” resonates with the scene where Jasmine meets Dwight

Unlike many of Allen’s recent films which are set against some of the most iconic images of
their respective cities BLUE JASMINE doesn’t showcase the most picturesque aspects of San
Francisco (a brief view of the Golden Gate Bridge from a Marin hilltop being a notable
exception) For the most part the San Francisco scenes are set in the workaday world inhabited

by Ginger The New York sequences on the other hand take you to Fifth Avenue and shops like

Fendi and Jimmy Choo offering the kind of luxury goods that define Jasmine during her New
York years

As she is such a creature of privilege one could easily take the position not to care about
Jasmine Says Allen “So she lost her charge account to Prada she lost her gold card and her
duplex on Fifth Avenue That’s too bad there’s a lot of people in America that can’t eat But
what makes her a person that you care about is that her story isn’t just about economic
deprivation it’s a tragic flaw in her character that made her the instrument of her own demise”
Allen continues “She is someone who chose not to look too deeply at the source of her pleasure
her income her security and because of that paid a terrific price To look the other way is a
human flaw we all share people do it in little ways all the time with their children and with their
husbands and wives” Says Blanchett “We all to a certain degree see what we want to see in the
people who we are surrounded by and certainly in ourselves It’s very very difficult for a human
being to truly look at themselves in the mirror to truly see who we are warts and all—and it’s
very difficult to change In the end Jasmine is a product of all the delusion and evasion that we
all have to some degree but as time has passed she’s become deluded on an epic scale”
Ironically it is precisely through these fantasies of Jasmine’s that her true personality seeps
through—it’s where her dreams and aspirations crystallize and appear in stark contrast to her

actual circumstances Says Blanchett “Our fantasies are always more than what we are”
