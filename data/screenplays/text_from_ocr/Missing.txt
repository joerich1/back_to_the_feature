This film ts based on a true story

The incidents and faccs are fully

Some of the names have bean changed
to protect the innocent

The guilty are already procected
EXT A CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

A weapons carrier straddles the center line of a road
in the outskirts of a large town Lined behind the
APC a dozen cars and trucks await permission to pass
Several soldiers accompany a nervous OFFICER down along
the vehicles checking IDs rummaging through trunks
and truck beds The uniformed men are tense skittish
heavily armed On che sidewalks other soldiers
brusquely search pedestrians An air of confusion and
disorder casts an added menace and danger over the
scene

A blue Chevrolet sedan arrives at the end of the line

The DRIVER is a self-assured middle-aged man Next
to him an attractive YOUNG WOMAN is turned sideways
so she can also see the rear-seat Passenger a thin
studious-looking YOUNG MAN The Woman and Young Man
are obviously on edge But the Driver acts merely
annoyed by the inconvenience Apprehensively the
Young Man glances out his window

The setting suns flickering Tays cast eerie reflec-
‘tions of shadow and light

4and group of barefoot barrio urchins playing soccer on

a side street are oblivious to the tur ulent situation
The Young Man ts mesmerized by their energetic anrics
Suddenly an Army truck careens INTO VIEW and the kids
scatter Leaving che ball in mid-screec uclained
The truck hits the ball which bursts And the NOISE
LIKE A GUNSHOT triggers a moment of panic

an overwhelmingly dangerous silence The Officer waves
his revolver The soldiers seek targets for their
weapons Terrified of triggering suspicion pedestri-
ms dont know whether co mm fall to the ground or
reeze

A jittery soldier approaches the car and jabs his AR-
L6 through che open rear window its muzzle jusc inches
from the Young Mans face He stiifens but holds his
composure Without be asked the Driver produces a
laminated 1D card Soldier grabs it squints sus-
piciously then beckons the Of icer who approaches
with self-righteous belligerence He recognizes the
card at a glance however takes it returns it to the
Driver and salures smartly

OFFICER
Captain Davis my bien vase
pase

The Officer signals with his gun to pull our of line
then walks ahead ordering others to let che Chevy
proceed

To the right in the mid-distance the Young Man no-
tices a woman in flight Through the tattered cloth
of her shredded slacks patches of white skin are visi-
ble As she runs the woman clutches at the flapping
remnants vainly trying to cover her bareness

The Young Man checks the Woman and Davis but they
havent noticed her The Officer salutes a final time
and the car moves off As che roadblock recedes che
Young Man opens a battered spiral notebook unclips a
pen and begins writing With slightly perturbed in-
tensity Davis studies the Young Man in the rearview
mirror Davis glances at the mirror onca more chen
focuses back on the road

CENTER OF THE CITY - DUSK

Streets are alive with prowling soldiers Armored
vehicles RUMBLE by A matte black HUEY GUNSHIP CRACK

overhead Occasional civilians shoulders hunched
against imminent blows hurry along as if pursued by
invisible demons

The Chevrolet CRUNCHES over broken glass liccering a
square In che bg heavy bonfire snoke vises curbu-
lently Soldiers are feeding the flames but we cant
distinguish what theyre using for fuel

Davis glances at his watch then tuzms to the Woman

DAVIS
Where do you Live Terry

Alartly the nervous Young Man interrupts efore she
can answer

thy YOUNG MAN
yy
DAVIS
(matter of fact)

So I can take you home Its
only thirty minutes until curfew

Terry is startled and begins co speak but the Young
Man jumps in once more

YOUNG MAN
Just drop us at che Hotel Carrera

Thats news to Terry Davis checks the mirror again
frowning slightly then looks to the street

EXT HOTEL CARRERA

The Chevrolet halts near the entrance Across the
street a tank is stationed in front of 2 frashly
bullet-pocked government building Descending the
Young Man hurries to the drivers window

YOUNG MAN
(curely)
Thanks for the ride

And he heads for the hotel without waiting for Terry
From his briefcase Davis removes a business card and
hands it to her

DAVIS
TE you need anything feel free to
call My home numbers on che back

TERRY
Thank you

Opening her door she gives a little shrug trying to
atone for her friends discourtesy But Davis waves it
off with an understanding smile Just then a TANK

PAST Standing up outside che car Terry watch-
s the tank as it heads down the street As a squad
of surly tou locking soldiers in riot helmets and
crossed bandoliers marches past Davis leans over
closes the passenger deor and pulls away Absorbed
by che soldiers Tarzy barely notices

INT HOTEL LOBBY

Bitterly upset and flustered the Young Man exics a
phone booth as Terry approaches

YOUNG MAN
The telephones arent working here
either

TERRY
Charlie why didnt you lec him
dvive us home

CHARLIE (YCUNG MAN)
And hand him where I live on a
platter Come on Lets grab a
taxi

As she starts to follow a loud piercing SIREN SOUNDS
outside signalling the starc of the sarfaw

They stop -- and are immediately engtifed by civilians
streaming through the front entrance looking relieved
to have made it inside in time Many are journalists
and foreign TV crews noisy jocular sros at home with
the vagaries of war They seem to be enjoying then-
selves immensely

Charlie and Terry realize its too lara to reach their
destination Charlie gestures dejectadly one step
closer to tears of frustration and apprehension

CHARLIE
Ioblew it Im an idiot

INT A ROOM IN THE HOTEL CARRERA - NIGHT 3

A shirt is draped over the lamp shade Terry sleeps
on ome of two beds The other its mussed buc empty
Charlie stands at the window head Pressed to the glass

HIS POV - THE STREET 6

Acsoss the square in a brilliantly lic villa surround-
ed by a large garden a party is going on Couples
lounge against wrought-iron balconies others dance or
relax on couches g and laughing Big shiny
gars are parked willy-nilly in che drive Charlie is
fascinated by the unzeality of the scene

An army jeep moves slowly across the expty square fol-
lowed by four transports bristling with helmeced
troops Several balcony couples applaud the convey

A few dancers emerge and join in Others look on in-
disferently from cheir surreal haven cf safety

INT HOTEL ROOM 7
We hear a RUSTLE OF BEDCLOTHES as Terry sits up

Are you okay
ae pnorts gloomily and settles into « chair by a small
esk

CHARL
Never falt becrer
TERRY
(drowsily)
Hey come on -- dont dwell on it

CHARLIE
Ive been thinking about whac

Ryan said About the piles of
bodies

TERRY
Hey come on Charlie Beths all
right Nothing can happen to her

Charlie smiles weakly grateful for the little pep talk

CHARLIE
Lord I hope so

TERRY
Do me a favor Leume see you
smile like for reals

Charlie launches a sickly strained imitation grin

TERRY
Yuuch You lock gruesome

He actually misters a flicker of humorous sarcasm and
morose comedy as he makes a dispirited V-sign

CHARLIE
Just call me Mr Opeimistic

But chen their eyes meet full of mutual anxiety and
the bluff collapses
CHARLIE
God I wish it was morning
Then picking up a pen he opens his notabook

CHARLIE
Does che light bug you

TERRY
Net at all

She settles back down and turns facing the wall From
the party villa SOUNDS OF HARD ROCK seep through rife
with rhythm and violence -

TERRY
Do you think its smart to keep
all those notes
Instead of answering Charlie begins to write
September 16 -- 310 am Terry just asked if its
smart to keep all these notes

EXT SQUARE ACROSS FROM HOTEL - EARLY MORNING

A last car parks and the Villa is silent now closed
up deserted At the end of the empty driveway stands
a massive gate

Outside the gate looking in Charlie wonders if last
nights party was just a fantasy Suddenly three
SNARLING DOB NS rush the fence leaping angrily
against the wire Several feet behind Charlie Terry
jumps back nervously Though frightened he holds his
ground further antagonizing the dogs

Then a window opens and through it pokes a long gun
barrel aimed down at chen ms ind

TERRY
Look

She turms to run away but he grabs her arm

CHARLIE
Dont run

EXT CHARLIZS HOUSE - MORNING

Street is frontad with drab gray apartment buildings
A cab pulls up before one of the few private homes --
a large weatherbearen structure sec off by a rusting
iton tence

Charlie and Terry leave che cab Anxiously he unlocks
the gate amd they start across a sczuffy lawn Charlie
in the lead Terry follows him around the main house
and through a scorched garden As Charlie approaches
phe house a duck waddlas out and he nearly trips over
t

CHARLIE
Ooops sorry duck Beth Beth
Then he and Terry stop The house is absolutely quiet
CHARLIE
Jesus what if

TERRY
She must be still asleep
Charlie approaches the house The frone door opens
and BETH in jeans and work shirt falls into his arns
her face radiant with happiness at the sight of hin

ly pulls back

Charlies voice is extraordinarily tender like a per-
son allaying the fears of a child beset by scary dreams

CHARLIE

She starts to cry

BETH
T was so worried about you
Charlie pulls her to him

You were worried

She looks at him a moment -- then her anger and tears
begin to fade She turns co Terry smiling -- reach-
ing for her

BETH

Beth pulls her close and they all embrace -- dancing
around in a circle

BETH

They stop She pulls back again but this time the
anger is mock

BETH

INT CHARLIES HOUSE - DAY

The cluttered cheerfully scruffy little place is bad-
ly in need of paine and repair Knick-knacks posters
and other stuff speak of disorganized yet sincere com-
mitment and youthful energy

No partition divides kitchen area from living room
where a large plywood desk is coverad with stacked

Papers and a wide bookcase overflows with paperdacks

Rewspapers pamphlets Wall posters range from Che
Guevara and Unidad Popular to the Beatles and slogans
such as Eat Oysters Love Longer

Terry has her suitcase open on the bed and is packing
her things Beth helps her

BETH
The first I heard of the coup was
on the radio Right after there
were bombings and explosions thac
went on for hours

Tn the kitchen Charlie checks the RADIO for a news
station There is noching but MILITARY MUSIC He
turns it OFF

Beth had told him there was a day-and-night curfew
until just yesterday

Charlie lights gas under a pot of water and then pre-

pares to make breakfast under the critical eye of the
duck perched on a counter

and Spanish olives

He leans over confidentially to che duck

CHARLIE

Beth appears at the kicchen door

BETH
Dont you dare

Charlie cuts off the spigot and drops the duck into
the sink full of water

CHARLIE
Relax I wouldnt dream of cooking

TV buffoon

CHARLIE

ANOTHER VO is followed by ANGRY SHOUTS The funny

Beth takes Charlie in her arms

BETH

Another BURST OF GUNFIRE brings them all up short
They wait in flinched attitudes for something more
horrible Ac length Bech speaks with deep fright-
aned determination

and clacks it againsc the cup she holds in her hand

CHARLIE

Beth gives him a playful punch in the gut

BETH

Charlie turns serious again

CHARLIE

things in Vina

Beths face lights up like a child being introduced to
a new game Charlie takes out his notebook

BETH

Whichever you prefer

They seem to be playing a familiar game

He pulls the book back ouc of her veach

EXT A STREET IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD - pay

tion Beyond them about twenty people ara lined up
at a bus stop

CHARL
Wait Beth maybe you bettar go

BETH
No Ill be all right I promise

Charlie is torn and then grudgingly srarts up again
A jeep inches by the bus stop as though passing the
would-be travelers in review As they reach the stop
a collective taxi arrives and the driver calls out his
planned destinations

BETH
‘avenue Picard I think Ill
grab it

CHARLIE
You sure its worth the chance

He kisses his index fingertip points it at her nose
and fires the love gum

Beth hugs Terry

Bech wedges into the already overcrowded taxi Sud-
denly che cruising jeep backs up and slams co a halt
Three soldiers jump out and start towards them Char-
lie and Terry gird themselves Beth sequs raady to
hop our of the taxi but Charlie makes a discreet sign
for her to stay put

Shouting threats in Spanish the soldiers pounce on
two women and slash their slacks wich iauives

TERRY
What are they saying

CHARLIE
‘From now on women in this camery
wear dresses

The soldiers swagger back to their jeep waving at the

rifles for her to pick up the bag and walk ahead of

Charlie reaches the kiosk just as the man in frone pur-
chases the Last paper Groaning he turns and sees

Te being marched off His face contores anxiously

Should he run after her or shout for help Instead
he follows at a distance as they cros the square en-

tering a Large neighborhood Laundry

Charlie hesitates screwing up his courage then pur-
posefully strides steaight for the laundry

INT EXI LAUNDRY - DAY

‘The soldiers lead Terry to a fiercely stem OFFICER

seated behind a counter The Officer peers over his

its contents then removes her passport handing it

to a soldier behind him who begins checking it against

finish unpacking As she complies Charlie is marched
up

The Officer jabs a stiff finger through her belongings
then gestures for her to repack The soldier hands

‘her passport back to the Officer He recums ic to

Terry Tension lessens a trifle

Piles of laundry lie about

In one corner a sheet is draped over a human form
Just above the body around chest height a half
dozen blood-ringed craters mar the wall Terrys eyes
pivot from the corpse to the Officer He nods at the
suitcase

OFFICER
Where are you going with that

CHARLIE

eyes Charlie warns her fiercely Dont look back

REESE
Tf I were you Id juse forget

Charlies not quite sure what that means

Suddenly a commotion A table overturns dishes
splinter Two large men in cheap black suits struggle
with an elderly gentleman and his lady They manhandle
the man forward steering him through the cables
knocking customers and waiters aside The woman fol-
lows beseeching someone to intervene

Without thinking Charlie jumps up and hurries ac an
angle between tables to propel himself in front of
them Not belligerently nor Like a hero but actu-
ally scared to death he Lifts one hand

Charlie is literally gasping from fear adrenalin
shock He is also almost crying

CHARLIE

because he knows he just did a very stupid thing

Reese checks the tables around then’

REESE

torial)

No deal The taxi SCREECHES away Beth checks her
watch then glances across the street at a bus stop
where anxious pecple are milling She considers the

jeins the crowd

A packed bus comes INTO VIEW but despite frantic ges-
tures from people at the stop it zooms by

Then yet another bus overloaded with Passengers cling-

ing to the doors and windows hurtles pest

People panic Several rush away Some begin to run
Beth hesitates then heads up che avenue striding
quickly through Lengthening shadows

AVENUE

Grateful for the relief small knots of soldiers
stationed at each corner ogle Beth almost harmlessly
as she passes

She approaches a shopping district as che last stores
close Many fewer people are on the streets Normal
city sounds have vanished Soon Beths own footsteps
are all shes aware of

She steps off the curb frantically asking an approach-

car to stop But it swerves reckless
Back on the curb Bech is seriously shaken

A tree-lined boulevard looms Several people scurry
actoss 1t toward shelter Then without warming che
Sum sets and darkness seals the eity The raucous

OF A LOUDSPEAKER on an army truck rumbling down
the avenue announce the impending curfew

around her

Beth freezes an army car slows up diractly across
the boulevard somebody shouts an order Rifles aim
in her direction Bech whirls diving into an open

a army truck illuminate two sprauled corpses Beth
tuns in the oppesita direction Rounding a corner
she draws up short utterly amazed A white horse is
galloping thr che square chased by a jeep full
of soldiers G tracer bullets ad shouting happily
at the animals panic

Beth ducks behind an cutdcor staircase as the jeep
jounces by Then shewiles exhaustedly onto the pave-
ment and closes her eyes huddling wp into herself
knees cupping her chin -- shocked fearful cold

EXT BOULEVARD - LaTER THAT NIGHT 25

Beth is jolted awake by sporadic GINFIRE -- some of

the clear night straining to listen -- and catches
stray words trom a family conversation snatches of

night sky Beth focuses on the soldiers feeding the
flames And abruptly realizes they are burning

pooks She is appalled chen tightly squeezes shut

DAVIS
But if he falls behind the power
curve and something happens --
‘Adios pal

A LOCK TUMBLES che door opens Terry steps back as

gulps aiz and tries a different cack

BETH
You want to know why I took 2 bath

Huidobro never showed right So
IT had to sit there and po itely
gobble down turkey a salad fresh
vegetables Beaujolais wine and
a creme custard with caramel syrup
for dessert in a country where
you have to stand in line for hours
to buy a loaf of bread And that
made me so tensa I couldnt see
straight

BETH
So as soon as I had the chance I
draw myself a hot bath in hopes
that the soak would quiet sy nerves
I locked the door too in case such
details matter to you but apparently
he had a stinking pass key

Elevator stops the doors open Horman marches out and
begins to stride across the lobby

BETH
Where are you going

HORMAN
(without turning)
Out for a walk

BETH
TheyLl kill you because of the
curfew

He stops and turns He is struggling to get something
off his mind Finally he manages to speak

RORMAN
Did she and Charles have an affair

Beth decides to play it differently A sarcastic smile
masks her rage

BETH
Yes they did Terry told me just
this morning that shes pragnant
with Charlies child

BORMAN
You dont need to be snotty

BETH
Well what kind of a stupid question

EXT CHARLIES HOUSE - DAY 54

Our CAMERA IS POSITIONED on the opposite side of the
street from the Horman house The WIDE ANGLE

the house OVER the SCENE a WOMAN SPEAKS low muffled
in Spanish Beth interprets

BETH (V0)
It was late afternoon when they
brought him our Four soldiers
and an officer were wich him and
two other soldiers carried boxes
of things

HOLD THE FRAME Then SOUNDS BLEED IN shouts
commands boots shuffling weapons Glanking An IMAGE
SUPERIMPOSES OVER the SCENE four soldiers and an
officer lead a young man through the garden toward
the street Young mans head is slumped making
recognition difficule Two soldiers in the lead
carry books and papers

BETH (V0)
Habian otres soldados
WOMAN (V0)

Si Estuvieron muchos esperando
cerca de un camion militar

BETH (V70)
There were many other soldiers
waiting at an Amy truck

We see them now milling around the Parked truck A
MANS VOICE interrupts objecting

MAN (V0
Que dices Mujer Yo vei solamente
ty pocos soldaos y el carro fue

privado
HORMAN (V0)
What did he say
BETH (V0)

He claims there werent many
soldiers And it was a civilian
truck

The SCENE ALTERS Now only two soldiers stand by a
battered Ford panel cruck Back Co us the Young Man
is shoved into the rear of the tzuck by one (not four)
soldiers The Woman protests

WOMAN (V0)
No estuvieron muchos soldades
y el camion fue del ejercito

BETH
She says No there were many
soldiers and ic was definitely
an army truck’

The SCENE SHIFTS BACK as before The squad piles in
after the Young Man and the truck takes off Now che
SCENE APPEARS as it was when first viewed

NEIGHBORS HOUSE - DAY 55

Horman stares PAST CAMERA at the house A tiny gnarled
old woman in a nearby wheelchair argues Rashomon- like
in Spanish with a chin pale man Beth kneels next

to the woman Horman walks over

HORMAN
Shes sure it was Charles -

BETH
Seguro que el muchacho fue ai marido
The woman hesitates then nods

BETH
(to Horman)
Pratty sure

HORMAN
With witnesses like this no wonder
nobody can find him

He heads across the street toward the house Seth pats
the old womans hand in gratitude The woman holds on
squeezing Beths hand sympathetically

INT HORMAN HOUSE - DAY 36

Scill a mess The door opens and Horman appears in
silhouette He is joined by Bech

HORMAN
Lord is this the way you found it

BETH
(joking Ly)
No It was a raal shambles

No reaction as he launches a brief inspection He
circles an overturned couch to reach the bedroom

Kicks pillow feathers from his shoes in the dingy bath-
room with its rusting shower walls and peeled plaster

His nose wrinkled in distaste he returns to che living
room area

HORMAN
You were living like this

She nods

HORMAN
Godl Why

BETH
Charlie wanted to live like the
people here

HORMAN
T guess its easy to be poor when
youve got a round trip ticker in
your pocket

Learning to recognize the trap Bech doesnt blow up

BETH

Let me explain something Ed We
dont look at it as ‘playing peor
We look at it as trying to be a
part of the community The people
feel we care about chem because we
live and work and play at cheir
level Its a way of giving respect

and of earning ic

While speaking Bech moves around in the rubble pluck-
ing at papers scanning then briefly letting them fall

BETH
Maybe it sounds weird to you but
this is one of the happiest homes
T ever had Charlie too We
really had our acts together

prooping she discovers a book Sc Exuperys THE
LITTLE PRINCE

83ETH
When we first got marvied Charlie
would read a chapter of this book
to me every night

HORMAN
What is it

Holding it up so he can read the title she quotes her
husbands inscription inside

She leoks up compelled to explain

BETH
Tn the book the Prince comes
across a wild fox in the desert
And little by lictle by being
very gentle and choughrful he
tames the fox So che fox tells
him a secret

She reflects for a moment

BETE
Charlies real good at caming people
She has been Leafing through the book Now she reads

BETH
It is only with the heare chat
we can see rightly what is
essential is invisible to the eye

HORMAN
Whats that

BETH
The foxs secret

She hands him the book then meanders a faw more steps
and locates a handful of kids bright innocent crayon
dvawings She riffles through chen

BETH
Neighborhood kids drew these When
we first arvived Charlie would
invite them to visit us They were
too peor to buy crayons and paper
At first their drawings were very
small Before Long y wanted
larger and larger sheets of paper
They had come to realize art was
Something they could be delighted
with and very proud of

She faces Roman straight on

BETS
Thats a gift Charlie gave to the
kids of this neighborhood

Hormans eye is caught by an ink drawing tacked to the
wall The sketch is of a fey fantasy animal half-duck
half-rabbit wich big limpid eyes Under ic is written
The Sunshine Grabber”

RORMAN
Charles drew this

Beth nods

HORMAN
What does it mean ‘The Sunshine
Grabber

BETH
Tes a poem and the name of an
animacion film hes been working
on Thats one of the characrars

Ed folds the drawing and places it in his pocket
HORMAN ’
He seems very innocent almose
deliberately naive
‘ B
Is that so bad

HORMAN
Ts this so good

Hold it Then a KNOCK on the half-open door breaks the
confrontation

Who is it
WOMAN
Hello
BETH
Eello
(to Horman)

Mrs Duran the lady I cold you
about Her mother lives across
the street —

EXT AN AVENUE - DAY 37

ing left and swings onto an avenue

A large ominous structure looms to our right Mrs
Duran speaks OVER the SCENE

’ MRS DURAN (V0)
The truck turned into che driveway
of the stadium

The taxi eases to a stop in the driveway

MRS DURAN
They waited a moment for the gate
to open then drove inside

EXT THE STADIUM - DaY 38

Soldiers and armored vehicles guard the entrance Many
women keep an anxious vigil near the main gate Some
have photos of missing Loved ones hung around cheir
necks Whenever a soldier or vehicle approaches they
hold up the photos desperately pleading for information

HORMAN (V0)
Hew come you followed it

BETH (V0)
She didnt She --

Horman sits next to Beth Mrs Duran is at her right

HORMAN
Let her cell ic please Why did
your taxi take the same route as
the truck

MRS DURAN
(points)
I live just beyond che scadium --

house of my mother

Borman decides to open his door and get our But a
black sedan swerves beside the cab just inches from
the half-cpened door and Horman pulls shut che door
startled

Three lethal-looking men and a woman are inside One
gestures for the taxi to move on

Horman would object but Beth grabs his arn

BETH
Dont

When he looks at her he sees Mrs Duran is serunched
down trying to be invisible

BETH
She could be arrastad jusc for
talking to us

Horman faces the Sedan again The man gestures not
a suggestion this time but a command The cabbie
shifts into gear and pulls away

The sedan pulls our behind it

INT HOTEL CARRERA - END OF THE DAY

Horman and Bech emerge from an elevator aimed toward
a small salon off the lobby Kate Reese sees then
and moves into their path She smiles familiarly ac
Beth then addresses Hormzan

REESE
My name is Kate Reese Mr Horman
Tm a reporter

Though Hormanis more interested in the salon where
Purdy Davis and Hon are waiting he nevertheless
attends her question

REESE
Ts it true youre fed with the
Embassys handling of things Are
you planning your own investigation

HORMAN
Im noc interested in challenging
what they’ve done Miss Reese My
only concern is getting back my son

And he heads anxiously Coward the salon

REESE
Try and get him co talk with me Beth

Beth goes to the salon Reese continues to look at
them - her smile is gone

SCENE begins in a room empty but for our players As
it progresses other guests arrive forcing the prinei-
pals to shift around sesking privacy

Horman arrives at the officials

Whats up Any
p yY news

PURDY
Shall we sic down

Horman shakes his head eager to proceed

DAVIS
Well we backtracked over our leads
with the milicary but they still
deny any knowledge of his arrest

HON
We also ran a fingerprint check arc
the morgues They came up negative

HORMAN
You trust your sources Colonel

HON
Captain Davis checked them himself

BETH
Well then Im sure theyre
impeccable

PURDY
What we now need is more informacion
mostly from you Beth For instance
why were you here

BETH
We were tired of seeing the world
through the New York Times We
wanted to to travel

PURDY
Why this country specifically

BETH
Wed been all over Lacin America
and we decided this was the best
of is

HON
You mean politically

SETH

I mean every way -- until your generals
took over

DAVIS
(smiles)
Theyre not our generals Beth

She doesn’t respond to that -- but Horman does leveling
another critical eye on Davis

PURDY
What kind of work was Charlie
involved in

BETH
What do you mean was

PURDY
What kind of work is he involved in

BETH
Hes making an animated Childrens
film and researching a screenplay
He also writes articles --

PURDY
You mean for FIN

HORMAN
Whats thac

DAVIS

A left-wing newspaper

BETH
FIN is about as ‘left-wing as
Colonel Sanders And Charlie
doesnt write for it he translates
news and feature stories from such
bastions of American communism as
the New York Post and The Wall
Street Journal

Her antagonism suggests they try a different tack

BON
Mr Horman theres anocher theory
kicking around

HORMAN
Yes

HON
He could have been picked up by
leftists posing as soldiers

DAVIS
tn fact some people think it may
even have been his idea

BETH
Which people Are you kidding

DAVIS
(to Horman)
He might have done it to embarrass
the government Make ic look like
theyre arresting Americans

BETH
They are arresting Americans Or
dont Frank Teruggi and David
Holleway count

HORMAN
I heard about them in Washington
They were released tight

Nobody really wants to field that question

HORMAN
We should talk to chem

BETH
Were seeing David tomorrow
HORMAN
(surprised)
We are
BETH
Tf they dont get to him firse

Horman takes a typewritten page from his pocket and
Passes ic to Purdy

DAVIS
Ts that my liste
HORMAN
No
(to Purdy)

Tes just some things Id like you
to check out

Purdy scans the page then shoves it into his jacker

PURDY
TLl do my best

(a beat)
Well if thats all I guess

HORMAN
Just a second Gentlemen

His face becomes cougher more authoritative

HORMAN
Im going to be perfectly frank
with you I know chac avery
American Embassy down here has
agents involved with Local police
and military training programs

Davis and Hon regard him with stone-faces Purdy is not
quite as cool

PURDY
Mr Horman

HORMAN
T assume that such an operation
exists here I dont want to know
what it is and I dont care who
runs it All Im asking is chat
you use it to help find my son
Davis opens his mouth but Horman cuts him off

HORMAN
Thats all I have to say right
now Thank you goodnight

He takes Beth by the elbow and ushers her out

61 INT LOBBY AND ELEVATOR

They hale

BETH
(rather awed)
I dont believe you said that
about the police training programs

HORMAN
Why

BETH
You cam get into big trouble with
loaded requests like thac
He punches an elevator button
RORMAN
Ive always believed char if you
call a spade a spade people will
respond favorably
open

BETH
You could get dead with chat kind
of ‘favorable response’

They enter The doors close

RORMAN
Thats your paranoia And of
course Charlies

BETR
Ed he ts not a failure

HORMAN
I didnt say he was

BETH
But every time you open your mouth
you imply ic

HORMAN
Well if you and he had just paid
a little more attention to che basics
this never would have happened

JOYCE
Oh and what are the basics God
Country Wall Street F

HORMAN
Theres nothing wrong with God or
your country young lady

BETH
I know I know God bless our
way of life

HORMAN
Ics a damm good way of life too
Ro matter how much people like you
and Charles may try to tear it dow
with your sloppy idealism

BETH
My idealism happens to be based
om facts in the real world not
on some kind of of Super Bowl
pizzified Tricky Dicky power
trip

62 INT HALLWAY AND HORMANS ROOM 62

The elevator doors open discharging Beth and Horman

RORMAN
I cant stand people who live off
the fat of their country and
their parents and then whine and
fuss and complain

BETH
Is that your image of Charlie
and me How could chae be

He opens the door enters his room and turns to face
the rast of Beths wrath

BETH
Ed were not some kind of freaked-
out acid-tripping Charley Mansonices
Weve just two normal slightly
confused idealistic American people

trying to be connected positively to
the whole dam rotten enchilacat

Bang He shuts the door in her face

Beth steps forward and slams the heel of her fist once
hard against the door

His back is against the door he is pale and trembling
and in shock from such a bitter explosion Ed is not
aman who likes or is used to vaising his voice
losing control or dumping soiled linen so crudely
upon the table

BETHS VOICE
(low)
Screw you then Mr Horman

Beth strides angrily down to her room unlocks the door
and slams it behind her

HOLD on the empty hallway for a moment

Beths door opens she storms out cancers purposefully
up che hallway to Hormans door composes herself with
two deep breaths -- and knocks

No answer

BETH
Ed Im sorry

No response

BETH
Can you hear me Are you all right
I said Im sorry

Nothing

BETH
Oh shit I blew it Me and ny

She shakes her fise in almost comical anguish at the
deor then backs away down the hallway making all

frustration ac Hormans door

INT HOLLOWAYTERUGGL APARTMENT - NIGHT 66

David is typing at a littered desk surrounded by book-
shelves and scattered papers ‘The room is large
eclactically furnished like that of a well-heeled
grad student Posters and prints decorate the walls
Skis adorn a corner

Opposite the couch 2 high Franch door leads to the
terrace where David and Frank said goodbye te Beth
earlier Suddenly we hear NOISES ourcsida BOOTS
CLOMPING UP STAIRS ROUGH VOICES SHARP SOUNDS Then
a rifle buts SMASHES glass che door flies open and

‘Soldters burst into the room

David jumps up crying Hey Frank Buc he is immedi-
ately pinned against the bookcase by a rifle jammed in
his belly His reaction from hundreds of childhood
westerns is to fling up his hands exclaiming Dont

shoot
an OFFICER checks a list of names

OFFICER
David Ol-avai

DAVID
Holloway

- OFFICER
Frank Teruggi

David points to a door Several soldiers spring over
flanking it with ostentatious skill The door opens
and Frank appears a copy of MAD magazine in hand

Two soldiers grab at him but Teruggi shakes them off

FRANK
Get away from me you assholes
What do you think youre --

Furiously -- and stupidly -- he goes ape swinging his
arms butting with his shoulders

DAVID
Step it theyll kill you

4and soldier swings his rifle butt knocking Frank onto
the couch Another goon lands on his belly jamming
a 45 into his neck

FRANK
Okay Youwin I give up

Meanwhile other soldiers search the room dumping
books tearing off poscers confiscating reams of

typescripc

INT POLICE VAN AND STREETS - NICHT 67

The van speeds down an avenue desarted except for other

military vehicles Occasional soldilers warm themselves
at bonfires

Hands bound behind them David and Frank are next to
the driver faces pressed up against the windshield
The Officer and several soldiers crouch in the rear
where hay bales procece against sniper fire

EXT THE AVENUE - NIGHT 68

The van swings into the National Stadium driveway
Many other vehicles -- both army and civilian -- await
clearance to enter

EXT NATIONAL STADIUM - NIGHT 69

The scene is electric with tension Harsh spotlight
beams roam che bleachers reflecting off prisoners --
Standing seated supine -- each one alone

Other groups huddle together for Protection Strange-
ly most appear to be spectators waiting for the show
to begin

The playing field is dark silent Soldiers Lean
againse vans and armored cars weapons aimed up toward
the bleachers

Tt seems each side is waiting for the other to begin
some kind of stylized cragic set-piece

ANGLE - INSIDE THE MAIN GATE

Guards yank Frank and David from the van and prod ‘then
forward Ac the same time almost a dozen prisoners
are shoved out of a nearby eruck and muscled brutally
onto the same ramp toward which Frank and David are
headed Again Teruggi reacts to the abuse He slaps
away rifle barrels knocks off rude hands They jostle
among the ocher prisoners Frank is almost felled as
David hollers

DAVID
We have a right to call the
American Embassy

Of a sudden a skinny handsome Latina student type

prisoner explodes at the abuse He Swings back at a
soldier and ancther soldier clobbers him behind the
head He drops poleaxed and is immediately booted
over sideways Both blows are astonishingly brutal

Six soldiers jump among the prisoners

OFFICER
Beat chem Kill anybody who
resists

Ic begins Each soldier kicks the Rearest prisoner in
the stomach two three times The entire body jumps
with each kick Men cry out Soldiers rap heads with
their machine » and stomp on ankles while the men
groan One soldier steps between the students legs
hauls him back and boots him in the crotch

The student flops forward shrieking and turns in-

Sanely lunging at his tormentor who knocks him silly
with a rifle blow

David and Frank are Paralyzed at the swift brutality
of this scene

INT STADIUM CORRIDOR - OFFICE - NIGHT 71

The corridor is an office Desks line one wall an
officer behind each one Frank and David are waiting
to be registered and questioned Soldiers everywhere
are herding prisoners or congregating around
“praseros keeping warm drinking soup

The most fear we have yet seen permeates this place --
palpable gritty sickening CRIES and SCREAMS spatter
up from the basement beneath the stadium often fol-
lowed by GUNFIRE The sounds are bizarre che absence
of any human reaction in the guards heightens the
unreality Davids eyes dart about his face terri-
fied Despite his hurt Frank is more watchful
calcula

INT CELL IN THE BASEMENT OF STADIUM - NIGHT 72

A locker room has been converted ince a detention area
Prisoners lie around on the benches Most have been
beaten Theres little conversation -- and thac is
mostly in whispers

Frank and David sit om the floor backs to a wall
Near panic David studies the trapped men around them

He shivers whenever MUFFLED GUNFIRE carries through the
corridors to their holding area

DAVID
Theyre going to kill us arent
they

FRANK
T dont chink so Theyre juse
trying to scare us

© pavtp
Well they sura as hell succeeded

FRANK
Hey man were Americans If

Davids Laughter triggers tears instead Teruggi puts
an arm around his shoulder Like a big brother’

FRANK
Hey Im telling you were going
to be all right

DAVID
I cant help it Theyre gonna

Frank figures his job is te hoid David together He
smiles gruffly

FRANK
Listen Ill bet you a dinner

David is willing to grasp at thee scraw and be a
little soothed

DA
Okay You gor a ber

They shake hands just as a door opens an OFFICER
sticks in his head checking a clipboard list

OFFICER
Tear0Gee

FRANK
(chilled but
doesnt let on)
Hah Looks like you lose turkey

Rising he squeezes Davids shoulder with affeccionate
concern

Be strong Soon as L get out
Tll head seraight for the Embassy

David nods with a gliomer of hope

OFFICER
Tear-0-Gea

Then he straighcans and limps toward the Officer
‘snarling under his breach

FRANK
Hold your water Mickey Mouse
The laste glimpse David has is Franks shoulder
Then David is alone glancing timorously around at
other prisoners as we hear the incongruous WHOP of

a tenis ball being seruck followed by a BRAVO
and a smattering of LIGHT APPLAUSE

INT AMBASSADORS OFFICE - Day 76

A large piccure window in che brighc high-ceilinged
parlor overlooks the Embassys vast well-tended gar-
dens The Ambassador rises as he and Ed perform the
amenities Beth hangs back avoiding the ricual

AMBASSADOR

Horman settles on the edge of a leather club chair
Bech remains standing

HORMAN

The Ambassador is puzzled Silently he queries Purty
then abruptly understands

AMBASSADOR
Oh no not thac ac all Is
Sorry

EO
What is it then

AMBASSADOR
T hear youd like to discuss some
political questions

Now Horman is confused Uneil che Ambassador clarifies

AMBASSADOR
You suggested that there might be
some kind of American police
assistance program down here

Ok Horman nods back on the track And relieved

AMBASSADOR
Id like you to know that nothing
of that sort exists in this

A pause Rorman doesnt buy irc

HORMAN
Tm not interested in che politics

resource at your disposal

AMBASSADOR

PURDY

to visic

HORMAN
What about the Nacional
Stadium

PURDY
Im erying But thats kind of
touchy

AMBASSADOR
Handle it

Another awkward pause Horman glances around the room
uncomfortably then decides to orge ahead anyway He
speaks slowly deliberately extra careful to make sure
his tone accuses nobody He is afraid of losing these
people as allies and regrets perhaps that he ever
brought up the police assistance progran

HORMAN
Look I know these are bad times
This ts no fun for you people
and it certainly isns any fun for
Beth or me or for Charles
wherever he may be I know youra

He halcs He is a little disconcertad by che faces of
his listeners The Ambassador is completely neutral
Purdy is anxtous his mind also on something else

But Bech is rapt and deeply moved by Eds plea

RORMAN

McNally and the Woman wait at the door while Horman

he might question Beth floacs away from him in a
peculiarly indecisive agony Its as if Charles his

Young Man squirms away

The Young Mans eyes dart around the room then back

Beths shoulder Sefora Beth can react Horman lunges
grabs the gun barrel and yanks ic away The soldier
jerks back on his weapon and he and Horman lock eyes

Mant girl Her tears have been replaced with a smile
She beams up at a YOUNG MAN perched on the sofa arn

of prasoners are scattered guarded by a hundred
soldiers

Horman Beth Purdy and Davis are in the empty playing
field Espinoza is at a microphone in front of them
addressing the prisoners in Spanish

Incroduction over Espinoza Passes che mike to Horman
For a long deathly-quiec moment blinking his eyes in
the cruel sunlight Ed erties to formulate words All
the prisoners are attentive A sea gull flies over
the stadium Hormans lips quiver he wipes his brow
But how to begin

Bech steps forward touching his shoulder

BETH
Are you all right

Ee nods Yec his face is cormented his brow heavily
furled
HORMAN
I domc I cant seem You

He hands her the microphone Realizing Espinoza is
impaciant and they have to begin she speaks

The statement echoes eerily across the stadium
“Char-leeleelee thisisis is is Bechethetheth

Ies embarrassing in a brutal way but she mist con-
tinue

Please come with us

The weird echoes die away No prisoners no soldiers
have moved a milimeter

Abruptly Horman takes the mike Now that she broke
the ice he can do it He speaks with a strange
strained formality

HORMAN
Charles Horman this is your
father Edward Im here in the
hope chat you can hear me In
order that you may know who I am
and trust ma Im going to

That does it A little flurry at the far end of the
Stadiim A figure breaks loose from a group of

prisoners and begins to run forward toward Horman
He rums in a distinctly disjointed way his arms and
lags flapping all over reminiscence of that time we

saw Charley in Vina running wich Terry to catch a bus

BETH
No Ed its not hial

He makes it down and stumbles over 2 concrare barrier
onto a track surrounding the playing field Ac the
same time a soldier brandishes his rifle to halt the
running fellow who is close enough for Horman to
realize his nistake

The Man puffs to a hale juse in frone of Horman His
crazed grief-stricken eyes flicker confusedly over
Eds face Then he raises his fist angrily and in
heavily-accented English

MAN

support ‘there we never would have had
these problems here After thar I

Budweiser (except Charlie who smiles thinly taking it
all in)

FIRST MAN

REESE
Herb Thompson didnt ride back

I wonder what Herb was doing there

HORMAN
Whos he

REESE
The number two man in the Embassy
(beat)
So the boss cf Milgroup and the
senior political officer boch happen
to be in Vina when the coup starts

Wearily Beth closes the notebook Horman goes to
Reeses desk looking down at the note pad He
notices a number tattooed on har forearm de looks at
her shocked she looks at him with a small sad smile
She reverses the pad for him One note stands out

underlined We came down to do a job and ics done

RORMAN
What do you chink Creter meant
by that

BETS

Obviously our Navy came down to
help out with the coup

This time Horman neds his head taking her dead seriously
LiL

REESE
Perhaps Considering our track
record in Latin America

She starts pacing trying to put it all together

REESE
T£ we werent involved in the coup
every les saw in Vina means
nothing If we were involved it
still doesnt mean much but it
could be significant Or somebody
might think it was At least enough
to take a Look at his jackec

RORMAN
Jacket

REESE
His record There is a file on
every American national living
here And if somabody reviewed that
file and discovered hed been working
for FIN well that somebody might
conclude Charles was a guy they should
take a closer Look at

BETH
Do you think thats whac actually
happened

REESE
Tt sounds very possible

Horman tubs his brow then his eyes He mums his fingers
through his hair

HORMAN
Te doesnt Look good does it

Suddenly from Beth we hear a sickening gasp of recog-
nition

BETH
(almost whispering)

His head snaps around He sees her standing over a
corpse He rushes over

The body in frone of her is not his son

HORMAN
Who is this

Raising her face she closes her eyes and snarls in
desolate frustrared keel-hauled Tage

his eyes Finally he murmurs bleakly

BORMAN
What kind of a world is this

Wow thats weird

114 INT HORMAN’S HOTEL CARRERA ROOM - NIGHT 114

Dressed in a robe Ed is seated next to the bedside
table talking on the phone On the table is a Bible
a travel alarm that reads 122 and a small framed
photograph of Elizabeth His voice is drowsy with
atigue

HORMAN
- No it’s just that every new

vaceiver)
Elizabeth Hello Yeah thats

(pause)
Yes okay you too I will
« God bless

He hangs up stares at the phone a toment then lies
back on the bed closing his eyes

A few seconds pass Then the phone starts to vibrate
giving off a RINGING SOUND Hormans eyes blink

en to lift che receiver he notices the
clock and the photo ara also Teer eng- A SHARP
CRACK follows And the room is jolted by the opening
tremor of an earthquake

Horman sits up just as the second shock hits He swings
‘his feet onto the flocr and is about to tise

He braces awaiting the next jole When it doesnt hic
he rushes cto the door and enters the hall

115 «INT HALL 115

Beth is racing out through her door pulling on a
tobe Other doors bang open panicky half-drassed
guests surge into the hallway Then a big jole hits
triggering SCREAMS and SHOUTS Horman grabs Beths
hand and they head for the staircase

116 «6 INT LOBBY 116

Pandemonium here Disoriented people stagger around
etying hysterical Perched on a chair the nighe
MANAGER shouts alternately in Spanish and English

MANAGER
Be calm The hotel s earthquaka-
proof No need for alarm You
ate all safe

But the next tooth-rattling giant tramor stampedes
guests toward the front door Leaping off his chair
the Manager caces to the exit and tries to fighe back
the terrified crowd

MANAGER
No please the curfew Dont
go out

A man jostles him aside and shoulders open the door
dragging his wife and child outside Qthers follow
into the night The Manager pleads with che reset
mot to follow

MANAGER
You must not go outside The
soldiers

A BURST OF AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE from outside Then
che fizst man owt bangs into the door and he and his
family topple back into the lobby followed by the
others who escaped

117 THE LOBBY MEZZANINE 117

Hormam and Beth have descended to this level A large
window behind them looks down onto the street MORE
GUNFIRE They rush co che window and look down

EXT THE STREET

People tumble out of their houses in panic Soldiers
tace up and down waving rifles shouting threats
Terrified civilians in pajamas and bathrobes are
shouting back at them angrily A soldier raises his
AR-16 and FIRES into the air The civilians are tora
between two terrors in a crazy Catch-22 scene

INT MEZZANINE

Beths fingers dig into Hormans arm and they lurch
away from the window heading for a railing that

circles the upper level

Everybody is rigid poised awaiting the next after-
shock Seconds tick by -- nothing happens We hear
SHOTS again -- but from farther away

The stillness is gradually broken Snippets of
dialogue carry from the Lobby Somebody Laughs
Rervously Slowly things return to normal Lights
in the upper level bar snap on And in no time a
small gang troops upstairs toward the bar

Beth still grips Hormans arm He ives her a fragile
smile die g 5

le § ¥ aware that shes been clinging
tightly Beth relaxes her hold Shes about to lac
go when he touches her hand Cenderly

RORMAN
Ts all right I donts
mind

Beth shivers brushing her head against his shoulder

BETR
Whew Thank you

HORMAN
Do you want to go up

BETE

Not juse yet Im still trying
to ‘come down’

Ed doesnt gec ic at first Then he understands the
play on words and chuckles

llg

Its starting to swing A guest at the piano plays
Scott Joplin Horman is drawn to che scene

HORMAN
Do you feel like a drink

She hesitates

RORMAN
Might help you get back to
sleep

BETH
All vight But not in there

Looking around he spies two chairs at a small round
table a nearby alcove

HORMAN

(pointing)

You go sit down What woul
you like

BETH

A triple shot of bourbon neat
with a vodka chaser

He blinks she chuckles sadly

BETH
Im only joking A glass of
white wine

For a second Beth watches him walk toward the bar
Then she heads for the alcove

INT ALCOVE - MINUTES LATER 120

Horman arrives placing two drinks on the table He
settles opposite Beth This is an awkward moment

as each takes their glass in hand Theres a pressure
to offer a toast But given the circumstances what
kind of toast could they possibly suggest

‘Then Beth vaises her wine glass extending it toward

her facher-in-law
lig

BETH
Ed

He lifts his own glass They clink vims

BETH
L chain

HORMAN
What does that mean

BETH
To life Charlie and I always
say ic

They drink

Then a rude little aftershock brings them both to the
edge of their seats They await anxiously but
theres no further disturbance and they settle
back a little

His drink between his hands gazing down into irc

unable to lock up Horman gathers the courage to
Speak

HORMAN
Beth I owe you an apology

She starts co shake her head softly

HORMAN
For a long time I have sold
you short both of you 1
dont know why I guess In
Older and stubborn

He halts Still wuable to look up

‘Beth stares straight ac him her eyes wide open with

intense compassionate concern She is very tired
also depressed

4nd yet in chis light in this circumstance Liste
-to whac this man is quietly and humbly saying to her
she appears extracrdinarily beauriful

HORMAN
In the past week 2 feel as if
my heart has been ripped our of
my chest and beaten to a pulp
and then stuffed rudely back in
my body again

Beth reaches almost touching his hand

BETE
Ed its all right
He looks up

HORMAN
I feel very guilty

BETH
Charlie once told me guile feelings
are like fear -- given us for
survival not destruction

After another pause Ed speaks quietly passionately

HORMAN
For what its worth Beth I think
you are one of the most courageous
People I have ever met

Now its her turn to look down bicing her lips to
stop the tears

FORMAN
T mean it
She nods refusing co look up
BETH
Thank you

They allow their feelings co settle for a momenc
When she is in control Beth looks up

BETH
Can I ask you a veal hard question

He nods sure

Beth gathers herself for a moment Then

BETH
De you think hes dead
His eyes flicker away In turmoil he sips his drink

RORMAN
t den (vaguely evasive)
onte know

B
(gently)
But thats not how you feel is
it

‘Slowly Horman shakes his head He looks very close
to defeated Then after a while in a truly weary
voice he changes the subject

HORMAN

I spoke with Elizabeth tonight
BETH

And

RORMAN
She talked with somebody at the
Ford Foundation today They chink
we should contact Peter Tell The
man who heads up their office here

BETH
De you mind if I skip chat one
They lift their nearly emty glasses to each other
again

HORMAN
- I guess you kids love each
other
BETH
Very much

We see in his eyes suddenly an apprehension for her
- £2 Charles should be dead

121 INT RECEPTION ROOM - FoRD FOUNDATION - DaY 121
A middle-aged WOMAN looking PAST CAMERA shakes her
ead

WOMAN
Im very sorry siz but Mr Tell
is out of the country ¢ill Monday

Horman stands across a desk from the Woman On the
wall behind her glitters a huge brass Ford Foundacion
prague 4 door opens and a young MAN appears asking
politely

MAN
Can I be of ‘any help

HORMAN
No I was just paying a courtesy
call on Mr Tell

Suddenly interested the young Man sticks out his hand

MAN
Youre Me Horman arent you

Nodding yes Horman shakes hands yet one more time
vary mechanically

MAN
Peter Jarvin m an economic
advisor with the Foundation
Would you come with me for a moment

HORMAN
T dont want to bother

JARVIN
Tes no bother Please

HORMAN
All righc

Jarvin walks ‘off and Ed follows ac the end of the
hall Jarvin opens a door ushating Horman through it

INT A CONFERENCE ROOM

The large panelled room is dominated by an enormous
oval cable surzounded by tan chairs Jarvia points
to a chair

JARVIN
Please Have a seat

Horman obe Jatvin plants a hip on the adge of the

3s
table looking down at him

JARVIN

I have a friend I play tennis with
I wont identify him except to say
that he works for an English-
speaking embassy here and is close
to someone with good contacts in the
military

(beat)
He thinks your son was executed in
the National Stadium on September 20th

A tiny rush of air escapes Hormans lips He sits
there for a long moment then checks the date window
on his wrise watch

EORMAN
(bewilderedly)
That was almost a month ago

Jarvin nods

HORMAN
Can I speak with your friend Or
with his contact

JARVIN
Im afraid noc These are very
dangerous times

Suddenly Hormans eyes grow sharp and urgent He
realizes that if he doesnt grab this opportunity

he may never have another one like it And his words
spill out in a rush as his whole demeanor as every
molecule in his body positively aches for a break

T’ll eon

’ Oo anywhere In way
You con take me blindfo lied with
my hands tied behind my back

JARVIN
T cant do that Im sorry

Standing he walks to the window

JARVIN
I probably should not even have
told you

Horman gets up shakily peering at Jarvin whos
silhouetted against the Light

JARVIN
This is a terrible tragedy

With all the controlled intensity and convicrion and
heart he can muster Horman begs

RORMAN
Please Just give me a name

But the mans silence is absolute Ed confrones that
blinking He canc accept ic But then he realizas
that Jarvin is giving him no choice at all And so
sagging he must acceape it
124

HORMAN
ALl right I understand Thank
you for telling me

He heads in the wrong direction for the door corrects
his error and walks out

123 INT HALLWAY - DAY 123

Horman stops disoriented Where is he and why
What should he do now Befuddled he gestures help-
lessly to nobody in the deserted shiny hallway

124 INT US EMBASSY - HALL - Day 124

At his desk Purdy is Teading a copy of the Oct 21
1973 New York Times headlining Nixons Saturday Night
Massacre Glancing up he spots Horman passing in
the hall Purdy hurries out

PURDY
Me Horman

Horman is moving with wounded Purpose toward the
Ambassadors suite Purdy trots after him catching
up at the Ambassadors door

PURDY
Tve been trying to call you all
morning

Oh Ed cocks his head

PURDY
Weve got some good news for you

HORMAN
Waat is it Thar my son was
executed in that stadium two days
after his arrest

PURDY
(startled)
Who told you that
Horman opens the suite door crosses to the Ambassadors
office and enters Purdy on his heels
125 INT AMBASSADORS OFFICE 125

The Ambassador sits behind his desk Ray Davis is
nearby

A rotund middle-aged MAN in a rumpled blue suic is
seated across the desk The Ambassador smiles

AMBASSADOR
4h good Consul You found hin

Purdy isn’t that overjoyed about his find In fact
he plays the next minutes with a nervous frown aware
of what is about to be said and unable to warn the
others °

AMBASSADOR
Mr Horman this is Mr Timothy
Ress

Ross starts to get up But Horman looks very tense
and sort of lopsided and hes obviously unincerested
in amenities So Ress slumps back down

AMBASSADOR
Mr Ross is a journalist with good
access to left-wing circles down
here And hes dug up some
interesting information about your
son

Horman fixes the Ambassador with a strangely inex-
pressive eye and makes no comment

ROSS
I believe that your son is alive
and well Mr Horman

Eds expression doesnt change But Purdy cringes

ROSS
Captain Davis asked mea to iacuire
about Charles’ whereabouts
spoke with a guy whos currently
helping political refugees escape
He told me his organization had
secured credentials for three
Americans to leave Santiago And
one of them was your son

HORMAN

(flat wemetional)
4nd wkhera is he now

ROSS
Tn the North He sould be out of
the country sometime next week

B
Can I contace him
Ross
No Im afraid nor
(smiles)
Bue I’Ll lay odds hes home in
New York before you are

Horman studies Ross briefly Then he locks eyes on
the Ambassador and gestures at the journalist His
voice when he speaks is calm but it projects
enormous possibly dangerous emotion

HORMAN
Please Get him out of hera
AMBASSADOR
Mr Hor--
HORMAN

I said please
Usdieacing Davis
and the Ambassador)

I want to talk with you two Alone

For an instant nobody quite knows what te do Then
Ross starts to leave Purdy begins following stops
and returns to Horman

Clow)
IT ll check your information
out

Horman is unresponsive Purdy backs away and he and

Ress exit When the door is closed Ed speaks

HORMAN
IT have reason to believe thac my
son has been killed by the
milicary

DAVIS
(almost scoffing)
Whered you hear chat

HORMAN
And they wouldnt have dared to
kill him wmless some American
official co-signed the kill order

DAVIS
Ridiculous Were here to protect
American citizens

His words sound patently hollow

Korman wavers t § to maintain his self-control
staring at che inbaseaioe’ His lips quiver Hes
also aware that theres something terribly banal
‘and useless in this conversation

AMBASSADOR
Mr Horman this mission has done
everything humanly possible to
locate your son

HORMAN
IT think you knew he was dead
right from the start And I
was hunting 2 corpse

DAVIS
If we knew why wouldnt we tell
you

Horman peers at hin trying not just to penetrace
Rays eyes but to understand something about the
spirit that drives this kind of man

RORMAN
I don’t know the answer to that
But I am going to find out

DAVIS
Why would we want him dead

HORMAN
Maybe because he knew about our
involvement in the coup

AMBASSADOR
Were not involved Mr Hornan
Our position has been completaly
neutral

Ed explodes

RORMAN
How can you say something thats
such a bald-faced lie six Youve
got naval engineers and arny
colonels in Vina del Mar Youve
got American military people
practically ruming the Ministry
of Defense

He sees then tolerating his outburst with absolute
hard-assed impercurbable calm And stops astonished

at both his own fury and their infinite indifference
to ie

He blinks His face ts squinched in disbelief
HOLD it a beat Then

AMBASSADOR
- Please Sit down

No thanks Horman opts instead to go to the picture
window overlooking the Embassy gardens As he walks
Ed staggers wuncertainly a couple of times but he
catches himself all right Ambassadors eyes
follow him across the room

AMBASSADOR
Its very obvious that youre
harboring some misconception
vegarding our role here

HORMAN
What is your role To support a
regime that murders thousands of
human beings

AMBASSADOR
Lets Level with each other sir
Tf you hadn’t been personally
involved in this unfortunate
incident youd be sitting home
complacent and more or Less
oblivious to all of this

Its hard for Borman to argue with that

AMBASSADOR
This mission -- is pledged to
protect American interests Our
interests Mr Horman

HORMAN
Not mine

AMBASSADOR
There are over three thousand US
firms doing business here And
these are American interests --
in other words your interests

Horman looks out upon the garden He studies the
broad manicured lawns che Neat carefully-crimmed
shrubs No refugees out there No tents no fires
no desperate women and children seeking protaction
and sanctity Only a pretty inescapable emptiness

AMBASSADOR
Im concerned with the preservation
of a way of Life

129

DAVIS
And a damm good way of Life at
that

Horman flinches remembering that he used that ex-
pression on Beth just a short while ago

Then he indicates the expty garden speaking half to
himself

HORMAN
Maybe thats why theras nobody
out there

The Ambassador stands up looking past him into the
garden He mills over the words and gets the
Message

AMBASSADOR
You cant have it both ways

Horman turns away from the window facing the
Ambassador and Davis I appears he will speak
but what else could he say And to what avail

So Horman crosses the wide room Ac the door he

auses looking back at those two for che last cime
is beaten They are implacable veiled serene

Horman understands this more from their posture and

attitudes than from anything else For now they

are dark silhouettes against that picture window

beautiful lawns and garden areas that
positively glimmer with controlled amtiseptic radiance

And chen Davis adds an epilogue His matter of fact
voice coming out of that faceless silhouette is extra-
ordinarily calm almsc gentle I seems to come to
Horman out of an anormously placid and yet also
profoundly evil draam

DAVIS

I dont know what happened to your
kid Ed But I widerstand he was
and snoop who poked his nose into a
lot of dangerous places he didnt
belong Now suppose I came up
to your town New York and started
messing around with the Mafia and
wound up dead in the East River
and my wife complained to the police
that they didnt procect me

(pause)
She wouldnt have a case would she

(pause)
You play with fire you get burned

And thats it Absolute silence The silhouettes
do not move A butterfly flutters outside the picture
window

Beth and Ed are poking around in the shambles gather-
ing whatever papers drawin 3 books notebooks or
other pertaining to Charles that che soldiers
left behind They place everything in the cardboard
boxes There is a desperate kind of softness in
their moves suggesting slow motion a trance-like

quality to the scene tinging ic with exceptional
sadness

Ed may not be crying but there is that air of pro-
found anguish in his look in his moves Perhaps his
eyes are red suggest it is the same day he Learned
for certain Charles is dead

McNally stands aside ineffectually Hes embarrassed
to be intruding on this tense private moment

Horman halts for a moment straightens up He exhalas
for emotional as well as physical relief His be-
wildered eyes take in che mass Then he goes ovar
and places his hand against a wall ina strange
touching way almost as if feeling for a heartbeac

Then he rests his head wearily against thac arn

Horman invading them like hope

Unless thar is nothing but despair
