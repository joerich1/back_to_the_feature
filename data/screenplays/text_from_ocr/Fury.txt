INT FURY FACILITY - THERAPY ROOM - NIGHT

OLIVER concentrates on the CREAK of LEATHER STRAPS as a
group of doctors tightly restrains him to a table

Oliver a gangling man in his early-30s lies worn battered
and bruised He’s weathered and has lived too much life He
clenches his hands nervously as he stares ahead -- a movie
reel playing behind his eyes

MEMORY FLASH

A close chaotic CUT of a fist smashing into Olivers face
Oliver crashes to the ground but there’s no time to just
sit and bleed -- Oliver quickly scampers away A man who
can only be described as the personification of a crazed pit
bull pursues

END MEMORY FLASH
No one reacts to the symphony of SCREAMS in the background
A DOCTOR fits a helmet onto Oliver’s head that covers his
ears while another injects a drug into an IV bag
MEMORY FLASH
A close chaotic CUT of Oliver viciously being choked by the
pit bull fighter They are both dressed alike in white
outfits and fighting on a grated metal platform CHEERING
AND JEERING fill the air

END MEMORY FLASH

Olivers eyes dart around the room

OLIVER
What happens to everyone else

MEMORY FLASH

A close chaotic CUT of a bloodied Oliver and the pit bull
furiously wrestling He stuns Oliver with an elbow and

stands to finish him off -- a crazed glare in his eyes As
he stands another fighter female but also dressed the
same comes out of nowhere with a savage tackle -- they both

fly off the platform

Oliver crawls to the edge of the platform and looks over He
is on the top level of a four-story structure -- a demented
neo-ziggurat The top level is roughly 15’ x 15’ The level
below where Oliver now sees the pit bull fighter and the
woman who tackled him both lying unconscious is roughly 40’
x 40’ Below that are four single levels standing 10’ off
the ground all approximately 15’ x 15’ The ground level is
circular and is enclosed by a type of plexi-glass

No walls or rails -- it’s treacherous

The whole arena is brightly lit with massive event lighting
Behind the plexi-glass walls there are rows of stadium
seating patronized by a rabidly excited but an extremely
well-dressed and obviously affluent crowd

END MEMORY FLASH
The Doctor looks into Oliver’s eyes

DOCTOR
You were the last man standing
Oliver You’re the only one who
gets to go home They’1l be fine

Oliver slowly slips into unconsciousness as MUFFLED SOUNDS
begin to play through the HELMET

FADE TO BLACK
INT ARCHER HOUSE - EARLY MORNING (SIX MONTHS LATER)

The sun rises as ANNIE ARCHER navigates the kitchen of a
modest two-story house One wall is having an interior
window put in but remains covered in plastic and
unfinished A small scruffy three-legged mutt -- Crouton
-- follows her around Annie is slender vibrant and
uncommonly pretty She has a simple small streak of purple
in her hair which is a fitting symbol of her personality

Annie unsure of herself opens the refrigerator and begins
pulling out breakfast items She looks through some cabinets
before going back into the bedroom

SAMS BEDROOM

SAM ARCHER lies sound asleep as Annie crawls into bed and
moves closely into his face He is a man in his late-30s in
shape and handsome in an utterly unremarkable way

ANNIE
(sotto voice)
Sam Sam Where’s the spray stuff

SAM
(stirring)
What
ANNIE
The spray stuff to cook with I’m
making you eggs and I can’t find
the stuff to spray in the pan

SAM
Why are you making eggs It’s five
in the morning

ANNIE
So you won’t have to get up

SAM
(endearingly sarcastic)
Thanks
(beat)
It’s down in the bottom cabinet
with the canned things

Annie kisses him on the head and prances out of the room
SAM’S KITCHEN

Annie looks in the bottom cabinet and unsurprisingly finds
the cooking spray She awkwardly cracks the eggs -- she
doesn’t cook

Sam enters the kitchen He’s without a shirt his back
putting a number of shrapnel scars on display On his arm
an Army tattoo

ANNIE
(disappointed)
Babe it’s supposed to be breakfast
in bed

SAM
I hate breakfast in bed

ANNIE
I know but it’s my special eggs

SAM
You have special eggs

ANNIE
Yes special eggs that can’t be
consumed outside of a bed

Crouton hops over to Sam but Sam shuffles to the
refrigerator and pours a glass of chocolate milk Crouton
barks and then rolls over He does it again
SAM
(to Crouton)
I see you Crouton

Sam bends down and starts petting Crouton He then lets
Crouton lap chocolate milk out of his glass

ANNIE
Honey I know you all are war
buddies but that’s plain nasty

Sam smiles takes a drink himself scruffs Crouton’s head

and gets back up

SAM
(to Annie)
Come back to bed You have to be at
work in a couple of hours

ANNIE
And you mister have another job
interview today and I think this is
going to be the one Did I tell you
that my special eggs are actually
special good luck eggs that make
you more handsome and endearing

Sam opens a cabinet reaches in and pulls something out
walks behind Annie hugs her and kisses her on the head
then places a small fire extinguisher next her

SAM
Just in case

Annie turns and throws and empty egg shell at him Sam
smiles and leaves as Annie turns and awkwardly cracks
another egg

EXT ARCHER HOUSE - MORNING

Annie leaves for work while Sam in his robe holds the
leash as Crouton does his morning business

INT CORPORATE OFFICE BUILDING - EXECUTIVE’S OFFICE - DAY

Deep within the maze of beige cubicles Sam very
uncomfortable in a pieced-together suit slowly opens an
office door

Behind the desk sits a late-20s pure jerk corporate

He
He

executive his name HAROLD WILLIS etched into a nameplate

on his desk He’s surprised by Sam
WILLIS
(quickly clicking off
something on his computer)
Whoa Have you heard of a knock

SAM
Oh I’m sorry Your secretary sent
me in I’m here for an interview

WILLIS
Well how about we run that back
and try it again but this time
pretend this is actually someone
else’s workspace

Sam slightly taken aback takes a beat and then walks back
out and closes the door He KNOCKS

WILLIS
Yes

Sam reenters shakes Willis’ hand and gives him his résumé

WILLIS
Have a seat

They both sit and there’s a beat while Willis reads

WILLIS
So Sam -- can I call you Sam
-- it says here you were a doctor
in the Army

SAM
A combat medic actually

WILLIS
Wow

Sam forces a smile Slightly uncomfortable Willis gets a
text and takes a beat to respond

WILLIS
(still looking at the phone)
And you were fired Is that the
right word

SAM
It was a medical discharge

WILLIS
(looking up)
Are you disabled or on some sort of
medication or something
SAM
No sir

WILLIS
Because we need to know these
things if you are

SAM
I’m not I’m perfectly healthy

Awkward beat

WILLIS
(not paying attention reading
an email on his phone)
Right
(re email angry)
Unbelievable
Un-freaking-believable

Willis barges out of the office and launches into a wave of
expletives and criticism at his secretary Sam uncomfortably
sits fighting the urge to leave

INT CITY BUS - DAY

Sam sits on a bus independent and aloof but simultaneously
observing the world in detail Even in a crowded bus he
possesses an air of isolation as if he’s set apart from
other living things

EXT ARCHER HOUSE - EVENING

Oliver walks down a sidewalk with a bag slung around his
gangling shoulder He has slightly longer hair a beard and
a tired defeated look about him

He looks down at a torn-out white pages sheet and then looks
up at Sam’s house

INT ARCHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - EVENING

Annie dries Crouton post-bath Sam is in the kitchen
preparing dinner

ANNIE
Well what’s your gut tell you

SAM
I can never tell about these type
of things
ANNIE
Did he like you

SAM
The guy was a jerk

ANNIE
Does that mean I don’t have to
count it against the stellar
reputation of my special eggs

SAM
Funny

Sam opens a door and goes into the basement for something
The DOORBELL RINGS

ANNIE
(still drying)
Sam can you get the door

No response The DOORBELL RINGS again

ANNIE
Sam

When Sam doesn’t respond Annie stops drying and with a
huff of mild frustration traipses to the door

ANNIE
(opening the door not
recognizing Oliver)
Hello

Oliver takes a beat to look at Annie then checks his piece
of paper again

OLIVER
I’m looking for Sam Archer Does he
live here

ANNIE
Yeah sure I’m not sure where he
is right now
(to Sam)
Sam
(to Oliver apologetically)
Just a second

OLIVER
Are you his wife
ANNIE
Yes I didn’t get your name

OLIVER
I’m Oliver

ANNIE
Well it’s nice to meet you
Oliver You know Sam

OLIVER
(slightly hesitant)
I’m his brother

This is news to Annie who stands there confused If there
was a definition for an uncomfortable awkward moment this
would be it

SAM’S LIVING ROOM

All three sit in the living room obviously uncomfortable
Oliver only occasionally looks Annie and Sam in the eyes

SAM
What are you doing here

OLIVER
I just want to talk Can we talk

SAM
You look awful

OLIVER
Yeah I’ve picked up some rust
along the way A little bit

ANNIE
So where do you live

OLIVER
Between situations I guess

Uncomfortable beat

ANNIE
Would you like some coffee

OLIVER
No No It’s just been a long
time I just knocked on the door
I don’t know I’ve been
traveling I’1l be in Manhattan
for New Years Eve actually I

Afghanistan
OLIVER

SAM

road before -- too many times
OLIVER

Gods honest Sam I’m clean I
don’t want any money or anything I
got some perspective I just felt
like I should come see you I don’t
know why

ANNIE
Where are you staying

OLIVER
I just got into town

ANNIE
Then you can stay here

INT ARCHER HOUSE - SAM’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Oliver almost childlike is in the kitchen eating a
sandwich while Annie spreads a sheet over the couch

SAM
He shouldn’t stay here Let’s just
pay for a hotel

ANNIE
(sotto voice trying to stay
calm)
Youre going to have to help me
here Sam because I’m really not
sure what to say

SAM
You don’t know him

ANNIE
(biting)
Whose fault is that

INT ARCHER HOUSE - SAM’S LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Oliver lies on the couch which is now covered with sheets
and a pillow He stares at the ceiling

SAMS BEDROOM

Sam and Annie lie in bed -- neither can sleep and neither is
enthused about the proverbial elephant in the room

ANNIE
Why didn’t you tell me about him

SAM
He’s a miserable drunk It’s
probably been 10 years since Ive
seen him

ANNIE
He’s your brother

SAM
I know I’m sorry

ANNIE
Maybe he just wants a fresh start

SAM
I can’t tell you how many times my
mom emptied her bank account to

(MORE )

SAM (cont’d)

send him to rehab -- always saying
the exact same things She died
broke because he couldn’t keep his
hands off a bottle

(beat)
He should only stay one night

(beat)
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you

INT ARCHER HOUSE - KITCHEN -— MORNING
A HAMMER CLANGS through the house

Sam comes down the steps and finds Oliver working on the
unfinished window in the kitchen wall and listening to TALK
RADIO on a BOOM BOX

SAM
What are you doing

OLIVER
(jumps startled)
You scared me Did I wake you up I
thought I heard you upstairs

SAM
I was up

Sam takes the hammer from Oliver and lays it on the table
Neither one of them really knows what to say

OLIVER
When did you get married

SAM
A few years ago

OLIVER
She seems happy It’s good

SAM
So where have you been

OLIVER
I got help They really helped me
They showed me a whole new reality
of peace It was amazing

Beat

OLIVER
Do you remember when we were kids
and we would memorize the lineups
of the teams playing in the World
Series I was just thinking about
that the other day
(beat)
I was at mom’s funeral you know

SAM
What

OLIVER
I know you think I missed it I
stood back but I was there I was
messed up back then and I can’t
change it now I saw you

Sam opens the refrigerator and gives Oliver a water He
looks at what Oliver has done to the window frame

SAM
This looks good
(softening)
Look if you’re really getting it
together That’s good

Annie rushes down the stairs with Crouton She’s running
late for something

ANNIE
Sam I’m late and Crouton needs to
go out
(to Oliver remembering her
manners)

Did you sleep okay

OLIVER
Yes Yes I did It was nice
ANNIE
We’re glad to have you Oliver
(to Sam)

After you take the dog out can you
drop me off downtown so I don’t
have to find parking

Sam grabs Crouton’s leash and takes him out

SAM’S FRONT YARD

Sam waits as Crouton sniffs around the yard He notices a
black SUV with tinted windows parked down the street He
doesn’t recognize it

He’s out there for a few beats A WOMAN’S SCREAM and a CRASH
explode from Sam’s house Sam drops the leash and runs

SAM’S LIVING ROOM

Sam barges in and is met by a bizarre SONG BLARING from both
the BOOM BOX and the TELEVISION equal parts odd catchy and
sinister -- the Trigger Song

He charges into the kitchen to find Oliver covered in blood
and holding the hammer Annie bloody and unconscious is
sprawled lifeless on the floor

Oliver’s demeanor and body language are stunningly different
than before -- animalistic and lunatic He’s weeping and
screaming at the same time a symphony of pain and anger

Olivers eyes meet Sam’s -- he leaps and attacks Sam with
the hammer -- a glancing blow to the head Sam falls and
backs away in a blur of desperation and fear He has no idea
what is going on

Oliver relentlessly and ferociously pursues -- lunging at
Sam again and again Frantic Sam grabs a screwdriver and
jabs it into Oliver’s neck causing him to fall back and
slump over

The suddenness of the situation is frightening Sam
stunned takes a beat to gather himself

SAM
(coming to scrambling over to
Annie)
Annie Annie

No response

SAM
You’re going to be alright
Somebody help me

OLIVER
(still weeping dying)
It won’t stop I’m sorry

The purple streak in Annie’s hair becomes stained red with
blood as the TRIGGER SONG playing from the RADIO and
TELEVISION ABRUPTLY reverts to their REGULAR PROGRAMMING

Sam frantically dials 9-1-1 as the CAMERA PULLS BACK out of
the house The black SUV disappears down the street

INT ARCHER HOUSE - ONE YEAR LATER

The CAMERA DOLLIES through Sam’s house SUPER One Year
Later It’s the same location but a very different place
There’s no warmth in the house and the project in the
kitchen is still not finished

The CAMERA SINKS into the floor and shows
SAM’S BASEMENT

Notes and papers are scattered -- a mess A small bed is
situated in the corner next to an equally small
refrigerator Crouton lies by the bed

Sam stands in front of a large cork board His tired and
unkempt look conflicts with his steely focus The board is
completely and utterly covered in newspaper articles maps
pictures etc

With each article certain things are highlighted some
things circled Push-pins abound and notes are scratched in
a nearly incomprehensible manner

Sam is holding a cover from New Medicine magazine showing a
late-40s male doctor -- Dr Julian Sandeen and his wife by
his side He’s put together well and you wouldn’t know his

nationality by looking at him The magazine reads SANDEEN

LEADS WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE INTO THE FUTURE

Sam in an act of defiance slams a pin into the cover
EXT BRIGHT SPRINGS INDIAN RESERVATION - NIGHT

Deputy Sheriff SHANNA OKERNOW drives a police SUV down
small reservation streets hundreds of miles away from Sam
She is early-30s Native American small and
delicate-featured but pretty in a flawed accessible way
She doesn’t stop the party when she walks in but she’s
pretty enough that you’d like to get to know her Above all
she has a vulnerable quality about her that masks a strength
even she doesn’t suspect exists

Her RADIO CHIRPS DEPUTY SHUTTER’s voice is heard
SHUTTER (VO)

Shanna looks like we have a 10-56
You need to get over there

SHANNA
(picking up the radio)
Where

SHUTTER (VO)
Preacher’s house

She curses under her breath as she puts the radio down and
does a U-turn

EXT MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Shanna comes around the corner and steps out into the rows
of near-identical mobile homes The flashers from her
vehicle light the side of the one that is her destination as
hastily dressed neighbors stand across the street

Shanna weaves through a small handful of officers and
paramedics and rushes

INSIDE THE MOBILE HOME

SCREAMS and CRIES hang solemnly in the air as she strides
down the hallway She stops a late-20s crime scene
photographer DANIEL PURSER

SHANNA
What do we got Purser

PURSER
Teenage boy Self-inflicted gunshot
to the head Grandfather found him
It’s pretty bad

SHANNA
DOA

Purser nods

PURSER
Looks like he killed his dog too
Who does that

She takes a breath and enters the bathroom Water covers the
floor A rottweiler is drowned in the overflowing bathtub as
an impossibly old Native American man PREACHER cradles a
dead teenage boy in his arms

A paramedic is trying to pull Preacher away from the boy
but the old man is fighting

PREACHER
No You get away from me

EXT MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Shanna sits with Preacher outside the mobile home Preacher
is stunned Shanna finds it hard to frame words as the
ambulance drives away

PREACHER
Don’t make no sense Miss Shanna

SHANNA
I know

PREACHER
Justin ain’t been right for a time
but this just don’t make no sense

SHANNA
I know

PREACHER
That place did it to him Sure as
the moon He ain’t been right since
he came home

Solemn beat
PREACHER
Just a boy Don’t make no sense He
deserved more winters than he got

Shanna puts her hand on his shoulder and gets up

SHANNA
I know

INT SHANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Shanna drops her keys on the end table of her sparse
bedroom She sits on the edge of the bed as she undoes
whatever ties her hair back Her hair falls and frames her
face as she removes her Kevlar vest

She collapses back onto the bed and stares at the ceiling
for a beat as tears fight their way out of her eyes

EXT SHANNA’S HOUSE - MORNING

Shanna walks out of her small proud home with coffee
in-hand and locks the door Her PHONE RINGS and she tries to
answer it as she juggles the phone the coffee and the keys

SHANNA
(into the phone)
Yeah Tell him I’m working Fine
I’1ll give him five minutes

EXT BLACKWATER CASINO - MORNING

Shanna pulls into the parking lot of the Blackwater Resort
and Casino an opulent establishment perched as the jewel of
a destitute reservation

Shanna parks walks inside and makes her way to the
OWNER’S OFFICE
Shanna barges into the office without hesitation

There are four people in the office ROBERT the casino
owner a Silver-haired mid-50s Native American mountain
of a man who commands the room with his presence JOE
SHIRLEY late-40s Robert’s right-hand Dr SANDEEN the man
we saw on Sam’s board CHAN LAI a stunningly beautiful
slender and dangerous Chinese woman dressed in sleek white

It’s obvious Shanna’s interrupting
ROBERT
(to Dr Sandeen)
Well I appreciate the visit

He shakes hands with Sandeen as Joe approaches Shanna

JOE
Good to see you Shanna

SHANNA
Joe

Joe leaves Sandeen follows but stops in front of Shanna

SANDEEN
(familiar faux politeness)
Good morning to you Deputy
Okernow You’ve met my assistant
Chan Lai I believe

Cold Obvious tension

SANDEEN
Let me know if there’s anything I
can do for that boy’s family
Suicide can devastate if not
properly handled

SHANNA
His name was Jeremy Id like to
talk about the time he spent at
your hospital

SANDEEN
Treatment center Schedule a time
and I’11l accommodate as best I can

He tries to hand her one of his cards

SHANNA
I know where to reach you

SANDEEN
(laughs off her rebuff puts
the card away)
Well then You tell Sheriff Aitken
that I said hello

Sandeen strolls out leaving Shanna alone with Robert
There’s an awkward beat as Robert pours two drinks

ROBERT
How’s the investigation going

SHANNA
It’s underway

ROBERT
(offering Shanna a glass)
What have you found

SHANNA
(short refusing the glass)
It’s underway

Robert pours it into his glass
ROBERT
(unsurprised smirks)

How’s Preacher doing

SHANNA
Not well He’s suspicious

ROBERT
Of course he is
(beat)
I know you’re close to him --

SHANNA
The man raised me for ten years

ROBERT
I know you’re close to him but I
don’t think I need to explain that
we can’t let tragedy linger It’s
in the community’s interest to have
this thing put to bed quickly

SHANNA
What Suicide bad for business

ROBERT
This rez is my business

SHANNA
Are we done

Robert sits down behind his desk

ROBERT
You know whether you like it or
whether you don’t you’re always
going to be my daughter You’re
going to have to find a way to live
with that

Shanna takes a breath and then turns toward the door

NEIGHBOR
Oh Certainly Vacation

SAM
Something like that

Sam turns and walks off the porch Crouton does his rolling
over trick to get Sam’s attention but Sam keeps walking

INT CORPORATE OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

The ELEVATOR DINGS as the doors open and Sam steps into the
lobby We’ve seen this place before Sam on a mission
defiantly strides past the receptionist and stalks through
the maze of beige cubicles He stops at a SECRETARY

SECRETARY
He’s in a meeting --

Willis can be heard BERATING someone as Sam walks past the
Secretary and barges into Willis’ office

Sam walks straight to Willis and before Willis can utter a
word Sam punches him from across the desk Willis tries to
back away but Sam grabs him by his collar pulls him over
the desk and throws him to the ground

Viciously deliberately and stoically -- this is how Sam
pummels the man as the Secretary runs for the phone

INT COUNTY JAIL - VISITATION ROOM - DAY

Sam sits on the wrong side of a county jail visitation room
His hands are bruised and cut and he’s dressed in an orange
jumpsuit but he doesn’t betray any hint of concern

Sam waits as an over-worked under-paid ATTORNEY reads his
case file

ATTORNEY
I’ve got to be honest with you
Sam You beat this guy pretty bad

on other things

JUDGE

INT BRIGHT PLAINS RESERVATION - SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAY

Shanna enters a small ill-equipped sheriffs office and
sits at her equally small ill-equipped desk She is the
sheriff-in-waiting The current sheriff SHERIFF AITKEN
late 60’s is asleep in his office

Deputy Shutter a portly late-40s man is talking with a
frantic citizen on the phone

SHUTTER
(into the phone)
Yes I understand ma’am I know
but there’s nothing we can do about
your five-year-old hitting you
Right Are you in danger Are you
in danger ma’am

Shanna can’t help but crack a smile as she looks for a file

SHUTTER
I’m hanging up now That’s fine

Shutter hangs up the phone -- exhausted Purser opens the
door and throws his stuff on his desk

PURSER
That kind of morning Shutter

SHUTTER
The picture of persecution Things
get crazy before the holidays

SHANNA
Did you start the file on the
suicide from last night

SHUTTER
Sheriff has it He closed that a
few minutes before you got here

SHANNA
What Do we even have statements

SHUTTER
Whatever we took last night

Shanna is disgusted She sits restlessly at her desk before
getting up and heading into the Sheriffs office

AITKEN’S OFFICE
She knocks on the door as she opens it The Sheriff stirs

SHANNA
Sir

SHERIFF
I was up way too late Deputy
which means it’s way too early for
any your complaints

SHANNA
Shutter told me you already closed
the case from last night

SHERIFF
Is that why you woke me up

SHANNA
We haven’t even investigated

Seeing that she isn’t going away the Sheriff takes his feet
off his desk and finally looks at her

SHERIFF
(irritated)
What else do you need to know

SHANNA
Don’t you want to know why

SHERIFF
Of course I do but I’m not a
psychic a shrink or a priest so it
ain’t my concern

SHANNA
But Sheriff --

SHERIFF
It ain’t my concern Deputy Now
shut the door on your way out

Shanna marches out of the office frustrated and incensed

INT PRIVATE JET —- DAY

Dr Sandeen sits in his private jet with his wife HELIN --
a striking woman that old writers would describe as a
vision She is looking out the window -- the Eiffel Tower
can be seen below Chan Lai is reading a magazine behind
them Next to her is a mid-30s first-year resident-type
doctor DR OWEN FINLAY

Sandeen crunches on dry toast while intricately whittling a
small piece of wood into a detailed figurine

SANDEEN
Hand me the roughing knife
beautiful

Helin turns her attention slightly annoyed There is a box
of knives next to her

HELIN
Which one

SANDEEN
The roughing knife puppy pot

HELIN
I don’t know which one that is

Sandeen looks up but his knife slips and he cuts his finger
very badly Wincing he drops his knife and his figurine
Suddenly he stands and violently stomps the figurine

HELIN
(seeing the blood)
Julian you need a doctor

Sandeen finally stops and sits back down He examines his
finger and after taking a beat to calm down he removes his
tie and wraps it around the wound

SANDEEN
I am a doctor teddy bear

The PILOT’S VOICE comes over the INTERCOM

PILOT (0C)
Prepare for final descent sir

EXT AIRPORT - DAY

Sandeen Helin Dr Finlay and Chan Lai walk down the stairs
of the plane and are greeted by a handful of older
businessmen Sandeen approaches the one in the middle and
holds up his hand that’s still wrapped in his tie

The men speak in French with SUBTITLES

SANDEEN
Forgive me for not shaking your
hand Delmon

DELMON
I take it you’re still whittling
your wooden pieces

SANDEEN
They say it’s good for the soul
but I’m starting to question
whether it’s good for the hands

They have a nice superficial laugh as the group turns and
begins walking toward a couple of expensive luxury cars

BUSINESS MAN 2
We’re excited for you to see the
updates we’ve made to our facility
Dr Sandeen

SANDEEN
You mean my facility

Chan Lai’s PHONE RINGS and breaks the awkward beat She
steps away to answer as Delmon opens the car door

DELMON
Of course We have your office set
up for after the New Year

SANDEEN
Wonderful

Chan Lai returns just as Sandeen is getting in the car

CHAN LAI
Doctor he’s in

SANDEEN
(in English)
I take it this has been confirmed

CHAN LAI
The paperwork has already been
filed with the court

Sandeen laughs -- unbridled joy Everyone else blindly
smiles along

SANDEEN
Well played sir

INT BRIGHT PLAINS RESERVATION - SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAY
Shanna hovers over Purser’s desk where he is printing crime
scene photos of the suicide She is almost mesmerized by the
gruesome photos as they are spit out onto the printer tray
Finally she breaks her stare grabs her coat and leaves
EXT SCHOOL - DAY

A high school girl ANDREA walks by herself down the
sidewalk It’s just starting to rain as Shanna pulls up

beside her reaches over and opens the passenger-side door

SHANNA
Andrea let me drive you home

Andrea climbs into
SHANNA’S SUV
Andrea is distant and isn’t looking for small talk
SHANNA
I didn’t expect you at school
today
Uncomfortable silence
SHANNA
You and Justin were together for a

while right

ANDREA
Two years

EXT AIRPORT - DAY
INTERCUT scenes

Sam carrying a small bag steps out of an airport terminal
and hails a taxi

SHANNA’S SUV

SHANNA
Listen I need you to help me make
sense of why he would do this

ANDREA
How am I supposed to know

SHANNA
Did you notice anything different
about him Was he acting funny

ANDREA
We were supposed to leave together

SHANNA
His grandfather says he wasn’t the
same after he was released from the
Whitestone Wellness Institute

ANDREA
(restless)
You can just let me out here

SHANNA
Anything you can tell me will help

ANDREA
I just want out

Shanna pulls over and Andrea gets out It’s raining harder
now Shanna sits there for a minute frustrated but the
door opens Andrea gets back in

ANDREA
Look all I know is that he started
having nightmares

SHANNA
Nightmares

SAM

Sam’s taxi drives onto the reservation and stops in front of
the Whitestone Wellness Institute -- an impressive
establishment which aesthetically looks like a health spa
but practically is built like a fortress Sam pays the
driver and takes a beat to look at the building before
heading up the steps

ANDREA (VO)
Really bad ones He would scream
and thrash around He’d wake up
exhausted I told him to go to the
doctor but he wouldn’t remember
having them It got so bad that I
wouldn’t stay over there anymore

SHANNA’S SUV

SHANNA
Did he say anything about what he
went through at Whitestone

ANDREA
Not really He would just say that
they helped him find peace and
whatever I don’t want to get
into trouble

SHANNA
Why would you get into trouble

ANDREA
I don’t know How am I supposed to
know that

SHANNA
Andrea do you think something
happened to him

Shanna notices Andrea’s hands shaking

ANDREA
Do you have a cigarette

SHANNA
Let me take you home

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - LOBBY - NIGHT

Sam enters a chic clean lobby A RECEPTIONIST sits behind a
desk wearing a headset Sam approaches

SAM
My name is Sam Archer I’m supposed
to be here

RECEPTIONIST
It’s very good to see you Mr
Archer Your liaison will be out in
one moment

Emotionless Sam waits

Finally a near perfect-looking LIAISON emerges She’s
dressed in a flowing white suit with a lime green broach
that pops against the rest of her outfit She approaches

LIAISON
(shaking his hand)
Mr Archer We’re so glad to have
you here We look forward to
witnessing your growth

The Liaison takes Sam’s bag and leads him through a set of
double doors They disappear down a long white hallway

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

Sam sits in a small dormitory room -- a living quarters
though there is no door It’s simple white and spartan
except for intermittent splashes of green He is now dressed
in loose white pajama-type clothing

The Liaison knocks on the door frame

LIAISON
It’s time for orientation Sam

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - SEMINAR ROOM - DAY

Sam dressed in his new clothes sits in a large room with
around twenty other patients who are all dressed the same
way A beautiful female SPEAKER stands

SPEAKER
Good afternoon everyone My name is
Ambretta and I would like to take
this wonderful opportunity to
warmly and truly welcome you to the
Whitestone Wellness Institute

A screen lowers behind her and a clichéd video begins to
play -- happiness smiles rainbows butterflies etc

AMBRETTA (SPEAKER)
During your stay at the Whitestone
Wellness Institute you will
construct a new reality a reality
of peace

The last phrase catches Sam’s attention -- he remembers
Oliver saying something similar

AMBRETTA
Now please turn your attention to
this beautiful video presentation

The lights dim A NARRATOR’s VOICE is heard as the VIDEO
visually depicts what the Narrator is saying

NARRATOR (VO)
For too long we have been taught to
avoid our anger to suppress our
frustration to ignore all the
emotions that God has given us

WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - MONTAGE
Sam participates in therapy sessions He takes two pills

NARRATOR (VO)
We have come to live in a culture
of distraction avoidance and
pharmaceutical ignorance

He runs shirtless on a treadmill wires attached everywhere

NARRATOR (VO)
It will only be until you learn to
embrace your anger and learn how to
use the primal emotions you were
fashioned with that you will truly
live a life of peace fulfillment
and total actualization

He sits in an isolated room across the table from another
patient A therapist screams insults and obscenities at them
both Sam looks angry but focused while the man across the
table snaps and grabs the therapist around the throat
Orderlies pour into the room to break up the fight

NARRATOR (VO)
At the Whitestone Wellness
Institute you will not learn how
to remove your anger Instead you
will become as special as you
deserve to be by learning how to
both use it and master it
Congratulations on making this step
and good luck on the spectacular
journey that is ahead

He lies on his bed staring at the stark-white ceiling

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Sam sits in a circle of patients Another patient stands in
the middle of the circle with a THERAPIST and screams as
loudly as he can -- a cathartic primal scream

THERAPIST
Don’t fear it Embrace it That’s
it Release it

The patient crumbles in a mess of emotion as the other
patients applaud

The CAMERA PULLS BACK into a security camera and continues
to PULL BACK into

SANDEEN’S OFFICE - DAY

Though dimly lit the expert feng shui of the room is offset
by the overall Stygian spartan atmosphere A plethora of
video monitors line the wall giving Sandeen visual access
to the entire facility A three dimensional hand-carved
board game with figurines sits close to his desk

Dr Sandeen watches the video and pays close attention to
Sam Dr Finlay stands with him obviously uncomfortable

SANDEEN
How long has he been here
FINLAY
A week tomorrow
SANDEEN
A week tomorrow What do you think
of him
FINLAY

He’s focused but it’s obvious he
is an extremely deep repressive

SANDEEN
(studying Sam’s face)
The stare is the familiar part Can
you see it Dr Finlay

FINLAY
I can see he needs help

SANDEEN
(suddenly excited
gesticulating wildly)
The winch of fortune is turning in
our favor sir

(shutting the video off)
Process him into FURY

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Sam lies on his bed staring at the ceiling Just as he
closes his eyes two orderlies charge into the room and grab
him Sam struggles as one holds him down and the other stabs
a needle into his neck

Sam slowly loses consciousness as the CAMERA SINKS into the
floor and

DISSOLVES TO
INT FURY FACILITY - ARENA - NIGHT
Sam buzz cut and clean shaven wakes up in a chair

He comes to in a dark much dingier much more industrial
place He can’t see the walls because of the darkness but
the place simply smells fouler He looks around and sees
another man in a chair next to him whom he remembers from
his therapy sessions They’re in the middle of a circle of
patients -- all stern bruised and worn

Dr Sandeen and Chan Lai enter the circle examining them

SANDEEN
Gentlemen We haven’t had the
pleasure of meeting

Sam’s eyes widen as he shakes his head to clear it He
focuses on Sandeen The man in the circle with Sam SCARED
MAN mumbles to himself

SCARED MAN
(sotto voice mumbling)
I want to go home

SANDEEN
Take genuine comfort in the
knowledge that you’ve been brought
here because you are special

SCARED MAN
(louder but still sotto voice)
I want to go home

SANDEEN
Until now you have been bred for
weakness Well we are not going to
allow you to run anymore

(MORE )

SANDEEN (cont’d)
gentlemen In here fear pain and
anger will become your constant
companions You will have to learn
how to use your anger as a workman
uses a tool You will have to learn
because if you do not well you
will become steam on a mirror

SCARED MAN
(becoming more agitated)
I want to go

Sam’s eyes dart around -- dissecting the situation

SANDEEN

(glancing over at the Scared

Man but maintaining rhythm)
While in here you will fight when
I say You will fight everywhere
including in this arena Pain will
be both inflicted by you and upon
you Don’t try to escape Don’t try
to resist Don’t plot or plan For
every ten of you there is at least
one person within your ranks that
reports back to me so definitely do
not trust

(with increasing excitement

and intensity)
Rest assured though that once
this pain this wonderful gift of
fear and anger is allowed to
freely operate you will be better
It’s simple gentlemen Pain is
your friend Anger is your brother
Fight well and it will be well with
you Fight poorly and it won’t

SCARED MAN
(extremely agitated)
I don’t want to be here I want to
go home

Sandeen approaches the Scared Man leans closely to his face
and touches his finger to the Scared Man’s lips

SANDEEN
Sssssshhhh Quiet now Quiet
There’s simply no time for this

SCARED MAN
Send me home You hear me I want
to go home

With frightening suddenness Sandeen grabs the man by the
hair drags him through the circle and throws him off the
edge of the platform in which they are all standing The man
lands with a thud on the level below Sandeen wildly
excited leaps down to the man The man is still alive --
bloody and moaning

Sandeen flips the man over straddles him and looks
intensely into the Scared Man’s eyes He’s looking for
something -- looking to see the pain Sandeen’s face bears a
look of both anticipation and pride

Tears form in Sandeen’s eyes He’s happy Not for himself
but for the pain the Scared Man is experiencing

He gets off the man and looks up at the rest of the patients
now looking down from above

SANDEEN
This This is what it’s about
gentlemen Welcome to Fury

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that they are on the top
level of the four-story fighting structure on which Oliver
was fighting

INT FURY FACILITY - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

Sam sits on his bed -- a small uncomfortable cot in a room
with at least 20 identical cots One of the walls is a heavy
gauge steel grill with a door that opens into a type of day
room The door is closed On the far side of the day room
there is a long hallway with other doors opening into rooms
the latrine washroom cafeteria seclusion room etc

The ceiling is grated and directly above is the main
fighting arena Six mechanical lifts that lead up to it sit
along the wall There are guards patrolling the area but
Sam isn’t looking to escape From the look on his face he’s
right where he needs to be

The Scared Man from earlier is a few cots away He lies ina
fetal position and continues to let out a mixture of weeps
and screams

Sam tries to shut the noise out while other PATIENTS YELL
at the Scared Man to shut up

Sam finally begins to recognize the danger of the place

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - HALLWAY - DAY

Shanna wearing an official Whitestone Wellness visitor’s
badge follows a Whitestone employee through blinding white
hallways Shanna looks out a window and sees a handful of
workers having lunch at picnic tables under some trees She
recognizes a young orderly before she turns a corner to
find Chan Lai standing outside of Sandeen’s office

CHAN LAI
Deputy

Shanna nods

CHAN LAI
Would you like a ginger ale

SHANNA
No

When Finlay walks out of the office Chan Lai turns and
leads Shanna into

SANDEEN’S OFFICE

Shanna immediately notices a sea of photographs of Sandeen
with seemingly every influential personality in the country
-- politicians judges stars athletes etc

Sandeen rises to greet her

SANDEEN
It’s very nice to see you Deputy
Youve caught me at a good time

SHANNA
Im glad

SANDEEN
I’m sure you are Come on I’11
show you around

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - HALLWAY - DAY
Sandeen and Shanna walk down a hallway
SANDEEN
To date we’ve trained and employed

over 100 people from the
reservation

SHANNA
Is that right

SANDEEN
You should thank your father He
championed the process of bringing
in non-native businesses

SHANNA
What made you decide to come here

SANDEEN
This is a beautiful place Deputy
Who wouldn’t want to be here

They pass a line of therapy rooms

SANDEEN
This is our main treatment area

SHANNA
Is this where Justin was kept

SANDEEN
This is where all of our patients
go through their growth stages I
understand you’re close to his
grandfather

SHANNA
He’s a family friend

An elevator opens to Shanna’s left An employee exits but
she notices an armed guard remains in the elevator and
proceeds downward

SHANNA
What exactly was Justin in for

SANDEEN
(laughs)
This isn’t a prison The boy was
here because he wanted help He was
intensely troubled To be honest
there wasn’t much we could do

SHANNA
What was your diagnosis

SANDEEN
Youll have to understand Deputy
that our patients’ privacy is
extremely important to us so I
can’t fully discuss

SHANNA
He’s not a patient anymore

SANDEEN
You’re correct which is why his
file is sealed

SHANNA
People say that when he left here
he was experiencing violent
nightmares What would cause that

SANDEEN
I can imagine a number of things

SHANNA
He didn’t have them before Did
they start while he was here

SANDEEN
I really can’t say

SHANNA
Was he given drugs

SANDEEN
Again privacy Should I call
Sheriff Aitken about this I’m sure
he’d be happy to help clarify the
legalities of the situation Maybe
your father could help as well

Trump Shanna’s frustration is almost palpable They turn a
corner and are at reception

SANDEEN
I’m sorry I can’t be of more help
I’m sure you’ll let me know if
there’s anything else I can do for
the family

SHANNA
Kid comes in with some sort of
teenage angst Kid leaves is
tormented drowns his dog and takes
his own life Something isn’t right
and I swear to you this sort of
thing doesn’t go away easily

SANDEEN
Well then Have yourself a good
rest of the day Deputy You can
leave your badge at the desk

As Shanna walks toward the door the CAMERA SINKS into the
floor and goes lower and lower until

INT FURY FACILITY - CAFETERIA - DAY

Sam stands in a stripped-down cafeteria with the other
patients He is handed a small metal box full of bland
unappetizing food

He sits down at a long table with a handful of other
patients including a huge glowering FORREST MACY FLYNN
who is equal parts hot tough and crazy -- always rocking
never still and BODIE CARTER a pudgy southerner who
carries a very gentle jovial look

Everyone eats though the silence in the room is so
uncomfortable that it’s nearly suffocating Everyone is
tense wishing they had eyes in the backs of their heads

SAM
The man who was screaming last
night was gone when I woke up

Macy and Bodie look up at him surprised Forrest doesn’t
respond choosing to concentrate on his food

SAM
Does anyone know what happened

Beat

MACY
(glancing over sotto voice)
He’s eatin’ the devil’s smoke she
whispers Fists didn’t abide all
that noise

FORREST
Macy
MACY
(little-sistery)
Forrest

Macy quietly laughs but it quickly turns to crying

FORREST
(to Sam)
We’re minding our business

SAM
(to Forrest)
How do I get to Sandeen

Forrest stops eating and sizes Sam up

FORREST
(distrustful)
We’re just keeping to ourselves
You just keep to yours

A BELL RINGS and an extremely pleasant FEMALE VOICE SPEAKS
over an INTERCOM

FEMALE VOICE (0C)
May I have your attention The
Whitestone Wellness Institute has
selected Patient Camacho and
Patient Archer as part of today’s
lottery

Everyone at the table looks at Sam gathers their lunches
and moves away Sam is confused On the other side of the
room an absurdly tattooed muscular man rises and scans the
room This is CAMACHO -- violence personified

SAM
(confused)
What does that mean

Everyone in the room is on their feet except Sam Camacho
looks at Sam and stalks toward him with a ghost-like smile
-- he doesn’t need much of an excuse to inflict pain

BODIE
(moving away inconspicuous)
Time to fight baby Turn around

Sam spins around just in enough time to get out of his seat
before Camacho reaches him Camacho viciously tackles Sam
over the table -- they fall to the floor

Camacho pulls Sam up and pounds him with two solid punches
Sam staggers back confused overwhelmed and nose dripping
with blood Sam defensively punches -- Camacho ducks

BODIE
Dis ain’t gonna end pretty

Macy rocks back and forth and Forrest watches with interest
as Sam is dropped by a kick from Camacho Sam pulls himself
up and exhausted backs up against a wall

POV - SAM

He looks at Camacho but instead of Camacho he sees his
brother Oliver charging him with a hammer Oliver swings

BACK TO SCENE

Sam’s eyes widen and an intensity washes over him He ducks
Camacho screams in pain as his fist slams against the wall
Sam quickly grabs one of the metal lunch boxes and dents it
with Camacho’s head -- he’s staggered Sam jumps on
Camacho’s back wraps his arm around his neck and squeezes

Struggling violently Camacho is subdued however Sam’s
intensity remains dangerously high -- tears forming in his
eyes Finally the BELL RINGS again and guards rush in and
pull them apart

Sam panting bloody and exhausted catches Forrest’s gaze

BODIE
(to Forrest)
Undercovers don’t have dat fire in
the eyes bossman

Forrest watches as Camacho and Sam are dragged away
INT FURY FACILITY - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Cut and bruised Sam sits on an examination bed Dr Finlay
is tending to his wounds Sam is wincing

FINLAY
(pulling a stitch tight)
You’re going to want to try and
keep this as dry as possible

SAM
Can I expect to keep seeing you
like this doc

FINLAY
(putting down his instruments)
It’s likely

Dr Finlay flicks a syringe

FINLAY
Try to hold still

SAM
What is it

FINLAY
It helps your therapy

Another doctor straps Sam’s arms down

SAM
Why are you strapping me down

FINLAY
It’s for your own safety

The other doctor hooks Sam up to an IV as Dr Finlay injects
the syringe into an IV stream Sam resists but becomes
drowsy and weak

SAM
(becoming less lucid)
I’m not safe

CAMACHO SCREAMS from another room

FINLAY
(Not reacting to the screams)
Of course you are

SAM
Did you know Oliver Archer

Dr Finlay pauses and then fits a helmet over Sam’s head

FINLAY
Just relax

The TRIGGER SONG PLAYS through the HELMET Sam’s eyes widen
but he can’t react He loses consciousness

DREAM SEQUENCE - EXT ARCHER HOUSE - DAY

Sam still hears the TRIGGER SONG PLAYING as he stands
outside his house He is dressed in his Whitestone Wellness
clothes He runs to the door but this time he can’t open
it He looks through the window as a crazed Oliver grabs the
hammer and rushes toward an unassuming Annie

SAM
Annie Annie turn around

Sam tries to kick the door down but to no avail He tries
to use a rock to break a window but the glass holds The
dream feels so real so vivid as the TRIGGER SONG PLAYS
louder and louder

CLOSE ON Sam’s face as he screams for Annie

MATCH CUT TO
SAM SCREAMING IN THE EXAMINATION BED
EXT LOCAL BATTING CAGE - DAY

Shanna walks past empty batting cages until she reaches the
end where KENNY stands inside swinging and hitting the
rubber balls fired at him from a mechanical pitching
machine He’s the young orderly Shanna saw eating lunch at
the Whitestone Wellness Institute He looks like an addict
that is still holding on to a vestige of an athletic past

She stops and watches him smack a couple of ground balls

SHANNA
Youre not getting your hips
through Kenny

Kenny glances back but proceeds to hit

KENNY
They teach you how to sneak up on
people in the Academy

SHANNA
Kind of I need a favor

KENNY
(laughs as he hits a ball)
Oh you need a favor from me

SHANNA
I’m serious Kenny

KENNY
What is it

SHANNA
I need some information on
Whitestone Wellness

KENNY
So go to the library

SHANNA
I need you to get me a roster of
patients that have gone in there

Kenny swings and misses

KENNY
Right

SHANNA
I said I was serious

Kenny turns and looks at her as the pitches continue

KENNY
First off I’m just an orderly An
orderly that needs his job to pay
rent Secondly why in God’s name
would I want to do you a favor

SHANNA
That’s what cousins are for

KENNY
And apparently for putting each
other in jail

SHANNA
You had coke in your pocket What
did you want me to do You’re lucky
you didn’t get a distribution
charge on top of it

KENNY
Whatever

Kenny turns and hits another ball

KENNY
Youre a cop Just go get it
SHANNA
I can’t
KENNY
Why not
SHANNA

Because I can’t Are you going to
help me or am I going to have to
bust you for the dime bag in your
glove compartment

The machine is out of balls and the mechanical arm flaps as
Kenny spins around

KENNY
(panicking)
You searched my car
44

SHANNA
No but based on your reaction I
guess I should

KENNY
You gotta be kidding me
(relenting)
How far back you need

SHANNA
Five years

Shanna’s RADIO CHIRPS Shutter’s voice is heard

SHUTTER (VO)
Shanna looks like we have a 417 at
Whitestone Sounds like it’s
Preacher

She curses under her breath as she puts the radio down and
runs back to her vehicle

INT FURY FACILITY - WASHROOM - DAY

Sam clearly shaken splashes water on his face in an open
Roman-style washroom He clenches his fists in an attempt to
keep his hands from shaking Forrest enters and starts
washing his hands Bodie stands in the doorway as a lookout

FORREST
(to Sam)
I wish I could say it gets easier

Sam doesn’t respond

FORREST
But it doesn’t

SAM
Youve got a way about you

FORREST
No sense lying Funny that this
part wasn’t in the pamphlet

SAM
No it isn’t funny at all

Point taken
FORREST

You can’t stay bowed up like that
and expect to survive this place

Sam starts to walk out

FORREST
(shaking the water off)
I knew your brother

He has Sam’s attention

FORREST
He was in here but I suspect you
already knew that

SAM
What do you know about him

FORREST
The difference between one of us
and one of Sandeen’s undercovers is
fine which makes everyone suspect
He gets off on the paranoia

SAM
And I take it you have me pegged

Another patient walks past causing Sam and Forrest to pause
their conversation Once it’s safe they resume

FORREST
Diogenes walked around Athens for
years with a lamp looking for an
honest man I do the same Whatever
you have bottled up inside --
that’s honest

SAM
Listen Forrest I need you to tell
me what you know about my brother

FORREST
(moving closer intense)
I know he got what we all are
trying to get Oliver got out Why
didn’t he go for help

SAM
He’s dead
EXT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - DAY

Shanna pulls into the Whitestone Wellness Institute

Preacher stands in the bed of an impossibly old pickup truck
and SHOOTS a RIFLE that looks even older The BULLETS
EXPLODE into the side of the main building The recoil
nearly knocks Preacher down SECURITY GUARDS yell at him

but are too afraid to approach
Shanna calmly walks up to the truck

SHANNA
Preacher

PREACHER
Ain’t movin’ me Miss Shanna

SHANNA
Go ahead and put your gun away so
we can get you home

PREACHER
I says you ain’t movin’ me Not
until I tear it to the ground

Preacher FIRES another ROUND

SHANNA
(moving closer)
Seems to me that you’re going to
run out of bullets a lot sooner
than that

This somehow makes sense to Preacher He lowers

PREACHER
Suppose you’re right Ain’t worth
the shells

Shanna climbs into the bed of the pickup as the
Guards come out of hiding

SHANNA
(reaching for the gun)
Go ahead and give that to me

PREACHER
They swirled his mind It shouldn’t
be on the rez

his weapon

Security

SHANNA
(unloading the gun)
I know
The Security Guards rush toward the truck -- guns drawn
SHANNA

(drawing her own weapon)
Drop your weapons and back off

After a tense beat the Security Guards comply

SHANNA
(to Preacher)
Let’s get you home

INT LOCAL RESTAURANT - DAY

Robert sits at a table with Joe eating a steak A napkin is
tucked into his collar protecting his tie The
establishment is small and is much more hole-in-the-wall
than one would expect a man like him to eat in An elderly
Native American woman MILLIE refills his water

ROBERT
(playfully)
You keep feeding me like this
Millie and one day I’11l make an
honest woman out of you

MILLIE
I know you Robert You’re just
after my money

Robert and Joe laugh as Millie ambles into the back
Suddenly Sandeen storms through the door obviously not
happy Chan Lai follows closely

Joe hops up defensively in mid-chew while Robert breathes

heavily out of irritation He lays down his fork and yanks
his napkin out of his collar Joe steps up to stop Sandeen
from getting too close but Robert waves him back

SANDEEN
What do I need to do to remind you
of the specifics of our
arrangement

ROBERT
Nice to see you too Julian Why
don’t you have a seat Have you
eaten lunch

SANDEEN
Your daughter has been making my
life very difficult

ROBERT
Let her kick up some dust You’re
insulated here
(picking up his utensils)
You mind

Robert takes another bite of steak Millie reenters

MILLIE
(to Sandeen oblivious)
Take a seat anywhere honey

Sandeen doesn’t even acknowledge her existence

ROBERT
It’s alright Millie He’s a friend
of mine Give us a few minutes
alone will you

MILLIE
You let me know if you men need
anything else

Millie turns and walks into the back

SANDEEN
Our arrangement which by the way
is more than likely paying for that
piece of meat on your fork is
prefaced on you controlling what
you people pass off as authorities

ROBERT
Everything is handled doctor

SANDEEN
Well it’s unfortunate that I am
rapidly losing confidence in that
very solitary fact

Robert stands seemingly taking up the entire room with his
presence It takes everything he has to keep his temper in
check but his eyes and the veins bulging from his neck
slowly betray his anger

ROBERT
Listen to me doctor I allowed you
to set up shop here to shield your
operation but this is my rez

(MORE )

ROBERT (cont’d)
These are my people This is my
daughter you’re talking about And
the only reason I let you come in
here and disrespect me like this is
because I like the way your money
spends But believe you me that
only goes so far

Intense beat Sandeen finally breaks his gaze and defuses
the intensity with joyous laughter The shift in his mood is
sudden and dramatic He loves the tension

SANDEEN
I like that Robert I really do
but we both know where all your
bodies are buried so let’s not
forget we need each other to make
our family function properly

Sandeen walks to Robert’s table and eats a bite of steak

SANDEEN
Mmmmm Excellent steak I have to
remember this place

Robert isn’t amused

SANDEEN
Clean up your end Robert and the
status quo will continue to profit
us both
(patting Robert’s shoulder)
I can expect to see you and your
men this week at the event

ROBERT
I suppose so

SANDEEN
Well then

Sandeen and Chan Lai exit and leave Robert fuming Robert
sits back down and pushes his plate away

EXT SHANNA’S HOUSE - EVENING

Shanna walks from her SUV to her door and finds a
nondescript envelope waiting for her

INT SHANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Shanna sits at her kitchen table leafing through a stack of
papers -- the names she asked Kenny for Her mind is
relentlessly working as she pours over the names Purser
wearing casual clothes appears in the doorway of the kitchen
holding a DVD

PURSER
You joining me anytime soon or are
me and Will Smith on our own
tonight

SHANNA
(half-listening)
I’m missing something

She opens up her laptop and starts typing the names into a
search engine

PURSER
I can just go

She finally stops takes a breath gets up and gives hima
kiss It’s actually a soft moment for Shanna

SHANNA
I’m sorry Are you in tomorrow

PURSER
Picture day at the high school

SHANNA
I’1l1 call you

Purser leaves and Shanna sits back down at her computer
INT FURY FACILITY - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

There is a nasty fight in the corner Some patients are
screaming and rocking back and forth lost in their own

minds but most of the patients are watching and yelling

Sam is standing in the far corner of the room away from the
fight and observing the exits -- the number of guards etc

Macy approaches and stands next to him

MACY
She wanders over to the stranger
and asks him why he isn’t watching
all the spectacle

SAM
Are you talking to me

MACY
He sits and ponders the obvious as
she tells him her name It’s Macy

Sam doesn’t know what to make of her

MACY
Will he be one of the six chosen
for tonight she asks the man with
the steel cold eyes

SAM
What’s tonight

MACY
(leaning in sotto voice)

And she is taken aback at his

ignorance
She smiles and walks away like a leaf blowing in the wind
Without warning a distinct SHRILL HUM from the INTERCOM
SYSTEM invades the room making all the patients in the room
drop to the floor

Sandeen enters the room looking very pleased He approaches
Sam who lies on his side dizzy and disoriented

POV - SAM
It’s difficult to focus as Sandeen looks in his eyes

SANDEEN
Prep him for the arena

Two guards grab him pick him up and take him away

FURY FACILITY - MONTAGE

The CUTS are very quick and chaotic

Sam wheeled through a hallway

Sam fighting orderlies as a doctor injects him

Sam shoved fighting and struggling in a tall black box
that looks like a coffin stood on its end The door slamming

shut

CUT TO BLACK

EXT BRIGHT SPRINGS INDIAN RESERVATION - LATE NIGHT

It’s late and the town has shut down for the night This
makes the string of limos and luxury cars that appear and
drive through the heart of town an even more peculiar sight

EXT BLACKWATER CASINO - FRONT ENTRANCE - LATE NIGHT

One by one the limos and luxury cars pull up in front of
the casino dropping off extremely rich extremely
well-dressed extremely successful men and women It’s
obvious this is the cream of the proverbial economic and
social crop Senators judges executives etc They all
saunter into the casino

EXT BLACKWATER CASINO - BACK EXIT - LATE NIGHT

These same people are funneled to the back of the casino
where a series of black SUVs wait Security checks names on
a list as people fill the SUVs and the vehicles disappear
into the dark reservation night

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - PARKING GARAGE - LATE
NIGHT

The SUVs pull off the main road and take a service road
From there they file into the entrance of an old diamond
mine that goes four stories underground and into a hidden
garage that sits beneath the Whitestone Wellness Institute
Once the vehicles stop the high-rollers exit are frisked
and are then led by multiple liaisons inside the facility
They are each given a booklet of fighter profiles

The buzz of excitement is palpable
INT FURY FACILITY - ARENA - LATE NIGHT

The Fury arena is brightly lit The high-rollers from the
limos are excited raucous and are quickly filling the seats
which have individual automated betting computers attached

Robert and Joe sit in the front row as six large reinforced
black boxes are raised from the floor of the arena When the
CROWD sees the boxes it ROARS with anticipation

INT BLACK BOX - LATE NIGHT

Blackness That’s all Sam sees He can feel motion and hear
sounds of MOTORS WHIRRING but can’t determine where he is
or where he is going The box is stood up and the TRIGGER
SONG is PLAYED through hidden internal speakers

FLASHES of Annie’s death mixed with memories of his time in
war invade his mind as fear and anger well up inside of him
He screams but no one is listening

The MUSIC STOPS -- just HEAVY BREATHING and Sam’s HEARTBEAT
A LOCK CLICKS and the door swings open to reveal

THE ARENA FLOOR

The CROWD EXPLODES as the doors open and six fighters emerge
from their boxes eyes burning with anger and internalized

emotion Sam’s mind swirls as fast as his heart races

He takes a beat to gather himself as all hell breaks loose
around him

The CUTS are QUICK and CHAOTIC as two fighters charge each
other and viciously attack each other Another fighter
races toward one of the platforms and is launched on top of
it by a pressure-sensitive catapult hidden in the floor

Sam looks across the arena and sees Macy already on a
platform fighting an extremely fat extremely tattooed man
The man clobbers Macy with an elbow snapping her head back
and dropping her to the ground however almost immediately
she hops up and spits blood -- she can handle herself

Sam turns and makes his way onto the arena floor -- no
strategy just survival

AERIAL SHOT - FURY ARENA

The six fighters swarm the arena floor -- launching onto
platforms getting knocked off platforms attacking one
another with animalistic adrenaline When a fighter is
knocked unconscious orderlies enter the arena and drag the
fighter off

GRANDSTANDS

Joe clearly enjoying himself leans over to Robert who
seems to be there more for business than pleasure

JOE
I can’t get enough of this

SAM

Seeking an elevated position Sam fights off a couple of
fighters and desperately works his way to the third level

The CROWD ERUPTS when one of the fighters is knocked off a
level and is knocked unconscious -- he’s out

Sam clearly fights more defensively than aggressively and he
doesn’t know it but Camacho who already sports a broken
nose has spotted him and closes in from a lower level

LIVING AREA

Forrest Bodie and the rest of the patients watch through
the grated ceiling as the fighters battle above The SOUNDS
of the CROWD can be heard Every roar is equated with
someone getting hurt

BODIE
She’1ll do fine bossman

Forrest doesn’t respond

BODIE
(convincing himself)
She wins and she’1ll get out Dat’s
the deal Dat’s what they told us
Dat’s what we want

FORREST
That’s what we want

SAM

Sam makes it to the third level He sees a woman charging
Macy with a pipe Quickly Sam grabs the pipe and throws the
woman onto a catapult launching her onto the top level

That gives Camacho the opening he needs He comes from
behind spins Sam around and uppercuts him snapping Sam’s
head back Camacho shakes out his knuckles

Bleeding Sam stumbles dangerously close to the edge of the
platform Camacho swings wildly at Sam with a fist full of
proverbial vengeance

Sam tries to duck -- too late --
The CROWD OOOH’S AND AAAH’S as Sam is hit solidly in the

face and flies off the platform and lands with a THUD on the
platform below

Gasping for breath and staring at the ceiling Sam sees
Sandeen watching from a glass booth high in the arena

Sam tries to fight it but loses consciousness as the arena
FADES TO BLACK

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - PARKING GARAGE - LATE
NIGHT

The gamblers still amped from the excitement file out and
get back into their SUVs Robert and Joe move toward their
SUV when a southern CONGRESSMAN slaps Robert on the back

CONGRESSMAN
(shaking Robert’s hand)
You weren’t ribbing me about this
Robert Worth every penny

ROBERT
(getting into his SUV)
I’m glad you enjoyed yourself
Congressman

INT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - CONFERENCE ROOM —- DAY

A handful of doctors and administrators including Dr
Finlay and MS BATA an intellectual analyst type sit
around a table papers in front of them Sandeen enters

SANDEEN
What is the report from last night

FINLAY
Well initial triage shows that
physically only one patient with
serious injuries

SANDEEN
Is the winner being processed out

DOCTOR 1
Yes sir He’s being wiped

SANDEEN
Good How’s Patient Archer
responding to the therapy

FINLAY
Slowly He’s more resistant than
the others

SANDEEN
(circling the room)
That’s to be expected Patients
driven by personal motivation will
always maintain a resistance to the
therapy I assure you it fades
Will he be ready for Times Square

FINLAY
He’s behind schedule It’s unlikely
at this point

SANDEEN
No need He can watch with the rest
of us How many actives do we have
in operation right now

MS BATA
Five hundred eighteen domestic
Weekly reports have all been issued
and show no anomalies They’ve been
cleared for the New Year’s event

SANDEEN
(suddenly grabbing the
shoulders of a nervous doctor)
Bravo

Leaning down to the doctor’s ear

SANDEEN
Never doubt as to whether we’re
making a better world You all are
part of that change

INT FURY FACILITY - LIVING AREA - DAY
Sam lies on his cot trying not to move Pain laces through

his body with every breath Forrest approaches and sits next
to the bed
FORREST
The first one’s always tough Some
people don’t make it out

Sam doesn’t respond
FORREST
I appreciate you looking out for

Macy

Forrest starts to get up

SAM
How long have you been here
FORREST
(sitting back down)

Too long

(re Army tattoo on Sam’s arm)
I suppose a combat man’s seen a lot
more than this

SAM
Do you really think he’1ll just let
you leave

Forrest laughs Beat

FORREST
Your brother was friends with this
kid in here from the reservation
Whenever Oliver couldn’t take this
place anymore this kid would tell
him this Native American story
about a man named Coyote Coyote
was a giant killer but was warned
to stay away from one particular
giant He didn’t listen and he
ended up getting eaten

Sam stares at the ceiling as Forrest talks

FORREST
But here’s the thing -- he didn’t
know it He thought he walked into
a cave but he actually walked
right into the giant’s belly So
now he’s stuck It was easy to walk
in but no one ever walked out

SAM
Sounds like a sad story to me

FORREST
No it’s not because after he found
out Coyote decided to take his
knife and start cutting the giant’s
heart from the inside When he did
that the giant opened his mouth
and everything that was trapped
went free All those things in the
giant’s belly weren’t as strong as
Coyote so they needed his strength
to get free

Sam looks at Forrest

FORREST
Oliver survived this place because
other people relied on him to be
strong I try to fill those shoes

Sam looks away

SAM
I’m not a coyote

FORREST
That’s what he said too

Forrest walks away The door to the living area opens and
Dr Finlay flanked by orderlies approaches Sam and shines
a small light in his eyes

FINLAY
He wants to see you

EXT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - ROOF - DAY

Sandeen and Chan Lai stand on the roof of Whitestone
Wellness Institute Sandeen hits golf balls into the
surrounding woods A hatch opens and Sam climbs onto the
roof He’s followed by two large orderlies

Sam worse for the wear with his ribs heavily bandaged
tries to disguise his limp as he squints at the brightness
of the sun Sandeen slices another ball and then turns
toward Sam

SANDEEN
(clapping pleased)
Behold the mighty gladiator in all
his thunderous applause

The orderlies exit down the hatch and leave Sam staring
intently at Sandeen -- Chan Lai skulks in the background
Unconcerned Sandeen turns his attention back to golf He
WHACKS another BALL

SANDEEN
Do you play golf Sam

Sam’s eyes are steely focused on Sandeen

SANDEEN
Most people find it to be calming
and recreational but I admit that
I find it to be one of the most
infuriating games ever invented

WHACK

SANDEEN
It’s like Beelzebub himself
delivered this game straight up
from hell It’s awful Especially
in the cold

SAM
Why am I here

SANDEEN
That sounds philosophical but then
again you don’t strike me as the
philosophical type

WHACK Sam’s hands ball into clinched fists

SANDEEN
If it isn’t philosophical then it
must be rhetorical because I’m
certain we both know why you
decided to come here

They stare at each other -- Sandeen with quizzical
anticipation and Sam with brooding internalized anger

SANDEEN
So in all actuality the question
you need to ask is what are you
going to do now that you are
indeed here

WHACK
WHACK

WHACK

SAM
I want answers

SANDEEN

(getting excited)
Yes Yes you do sir All of this
has been to get answers to the
questions that have been plaguing
your seemingly complex mind and how
ridiculously fortuitous is it that
I happen to be a man of many
answers Supply and demand The way
of the world

SAM
And you’re just going to tell me
what I want to know

SANDEEN
I don’t have anything to hide Sam
I mean I’m being serious when I
ask you who are you going to run
to after I tell you what you want
to know We both know that you
never intended to leave once you
got here

SAM
Why did my brother kill my wife

SANDEEN
Outstanding Getting right to it
Well to put it simply I don’t
know exactly People respond to
stimuli differently That’s why
were testing it Trial and error

SAM
He was an experiment

SANDEEN
We just did what we do to everyone
here We took a miserable weak
insignificant worm of a man and
turned him into a strong pillar of
direction The caterpillar to the
proverbial butterfly You know I
hate the way clichés taste coming
out of my mouth I apologize
Sam scans

WHACK

SAM
You killed her

SANDEEN
Now that wasn’t a question but
strictly speaking no Oliver has
to take responsibility for his own
actions I was simply the catalyst
I suppose this is the part where
you threaten my life

SAM
I guess that makes me predictable
for possible weapons -- rocks anything
SANDEEN
(elated)

Slightly Now I picture Annie as a
good person Like the kind that has
butterflies flying around her on a

sunshiny day

Sandeen slices one very badly

WHACK

SANDEEN
Are you sure you don’t want to hit
a few balls

SAM
Why do the ones that leave end up
killing other people

SANDEEN
Not all of them do but you’re
right there are some select ones
that absolutely do When their
treatment is finished we use them
to spread what they found to
others

SANDEEN
It’s simple evangelism And let me
tell you do I have something
special planned to ring in the new
year

SAM
The music I heard when Oliver
killed her You use that somehow
These people think they’re being
released but they’re not really
free

SANDEEN
(angry throwing his club)
And they were free before
(beat)
Why do you want to know these
things so badly

SAM
Because I’ve spent the last year of
my life trying to find out why my
wife was beaten to death

SANDEEN
(taking off his glove calmer)
Of course It’s your penance

Without warning Sam leaps on Sandeen and wraps his hands
around his neck Both men crash to the ground Sam has a
vice grip on Sandeen’s neck but Chan Lai quickly smashes
Sam in the ribs with her boot -- blinding pain Sam slumps
over and Sandeen climbs on Sam’s back his entire weight
holding Sam down Intense excitement oozes from Sandeen

Sam struggles more out of principle than practicality
Finally he stops -- beaten Sandeen gets up and checks his
neck Sam can’t rise because of the pain

SAM
I’m going to kill you You know
that You won’t do this again

SANDEEN
(worked up)
Of course I will Sam I’m a doctor
to the people who don’t know
they’re sick

SAM
What makes you think I won’t try to
stop you

SANDEEN
Oh no Sam You still don’t
understand I hope you do

Sandeen smiles gets up and walks to the hatch He looks
back up as he opens it

SANDEEN
Feel free hit a few balls

Sandeen and Chan Lai climb down the hatch leaving Sam on
the roof beaten and alone

EXT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - EARLY EVENING

Dr Finlay obviously tired walks to his car after a hard
day’s work Even though he’s a doctor his car is modest and
obviously a few years old He throws his bag on the
passenger seat gets in and drives away

Once he leaves the Whitestone premises Shanna’s SUV appears
and follows

EXT BRIGHT SPRINGS INDIAN RESERVATION - CITY STREETS -

Dr Finlay drives off the reservation Shanna still tailing
INT CONVENIENT STORE - NIGHT
Dr Finlay grabs two six-packs of beer and sets them on the
counter He reaches for his wallet when Shanna approaches
She’s in plain clothes but is still packing heat
SHANNA
Is this how you celebrate
Christmas
Finlay recognizes her but doesn’t react
SHANNA
Dr Finlay I’m going to need to ask
you a few questions

Not tonight
Finlay exits with Shanna quickly following
CONVENIENT STORE PARKING LOT
Shanna quickens her step to keep up with Finlay
SHANNA

It’s going to have to happen sooner
or later Might as well be now

FINLAY
I don’t have anything to say

Finlay unlocks his car and gets in Shanna hurries to the
other side of the car and gets in the passenger seat

INSIDE FINLAY’S CAR

FINLAY
Cmon You can’t get in my car

SHANNA
You’re just about to tell me that I
don’t have jurisdiction off the
reservation so let me go ahead and
let you know that I really don’t
care The only thing that matters
is that I’m a girl with a gun and
an agenda and you’re not Now all
I’m asking for is ten minutes of
your time

Beat Finlay gives in He nervously looks around

FINLAY
We can’t talk here

INT FINLAY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sounds of a KEY IN A LOCK are heard as Finlay and Shanna
enter Much like his car Finlay’s apartment isn’t what you
would expect from a doctor It’s small and plain

He walks in flips on the lights puts his beer in the
refrigerator and then turns around to see Shanna pointing
her gun at him

FINLAY
(startled)
Hey I said Id talk

SHANNA
I’m just trying to ensure the
quality of our conversation
(sitting down at a small
kitchen table)
I want to know about the Whitestone
Wellness Institute

Finlay sits down

FINLAY
What about it

Shanna throws her printed articles on the table

SHANNA
Tell me what Sandeen’s doing to
these people

Finlay gets more nervous

FINLAY
(pointing to the refrigerator)
You mind

Shanna nods and Finlay plucks two beers from the
refrigerator He slides one over to Shanna who ignores it

FINLAY
You know when I got hired by
Julian Sandeen I thought I’d won
the job lottery

SHANNA
What goes on in that place

He takes a drink

FINLAY
You have to keep my name out of all
of this

SHANNA

Just tell me what you know

on underground fights

Finlay looks away He betrays a hint of shame

FINLAY
The patients

Shanna is taken aback Now that Finlay is opening up she
lowers her weapon

SHANNA
Why are people snapping once they
get out

FINLAY

It’s a part of Sandeen’s program
Some are tests Some mistakes

SHANNA
Which one was Justin

FINLAY
(shamefully)
A mistake

Shanna smolders but stays focused

SHANNA
Tell me about Sam Archer

FINLAY
How do you know about Sam Archer

SHANNA
When someone goes into Whitestone
gets out murders his brother’s
wife and then that brother admits
himself into the very same place
it piques my interest You’re going
to tell me what’s happened to him

FINLAY

He’s with the patients

(pleading)
I didn’t know about this when I was
brought on But once you’re in
he just keeps enveloping you I
just got stuck I’m the one who
treats them

Shanna gets up and starts pacing around the room

SHANNA
Sam Archer put himself in there for
a reason He knows something
There’s a storm brewing in my
backyard so I need to get to him

FINLAY
You can’t

SHANNA
Why not

FINLAY

Because you can’t Sandeen keeps
the patients locked away You’1l
never get to him

Shanna processes all of this Finlay keeps drinking

SHANNA
That’s not all

FINLAY
I don’t know anything else

SHANNA
Tell me why they snap

Finlay is quickly going from nervous to terrified

FINLAY
Look I gave you ten minutes --

SHANNA
You need to tell me the truth

FINLAY
There’s nothing else to tell

Shanna thinks quickly raises her GUN and FIRES it past
Finlay He screams and ducks

He implants subconscious triggers
in them before they’re released He
sets them off and they snap

lunatic Does it matter

Shanna quickly calculates her next move

Shanna raises her gun threateningly again

INT CITY DELI - NIGHT

Shanna in plain clothes sips on a cup of coffee in a city
deli She focuses on a man bussing tables who’s prepping the
deli for closing He turns -- it’s Camacho -- but he has a
remarkably different demeanor than he had in the facility
After wiping down some tables he removes the bag from a
couple of garbage cans and exits toward the back Tracking
him Shanna puts down her coffee and follows

BEHIND THE DELI

Camacho throws the trash into a dumpster closes it and
turns to see Shanna standing behind him He’s startled

Suddenly the MUSIC on the RADIO cuts out and is replaced
with the TRIGGER SONG Camacho grabs his head and starts

rocking back and forth Tears stream down his face

When Forrest gets knocked back to the edge of a platform
Sam leaps out of nowhere and tackles one of the men

With lightning quickness though the man pops up and
charges Sam At the last second Sam dodges and the man
flies off the platform The CROWD ROARS

Forrest disposes of the man he’s fighting and then turns
wild-eyed and bloody toward Sam -- no recognition in his
eyes His shirt has been ripped off -- the bruises and scars
on his body showing just how long he’s been in the program

Sam works against the other fighters as he makes his way
from platform to platform toward Bodie

Finally he reaches him as he climbs a set of steps to the
top level Sam grabs Bodie’s foot and pulls him back down

Bodie swings wildly at Sam -- a shot to the face -- it
knocks Sam back but Sam quickly recovers and smashes Bodie
headfirst into the steps -- Bodie’s out

There are two left Sam and a ridiculously obese man who is
shockingly agile for his size Sam moves onto the top level
where the obese man waits Once on top the obese man
charges like a sumo wrestler Sam glances up to Sandeen
before a large forearm smashes him in the face

Two orderlies wheel Sam who is strapped to a gurney down a
hallway The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic
regularity Sam’s eyes are closed -- he is motionless

INT FURY FACILITY - EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Dr Finlay preps the examination room as the orderlies wheel
Sam through the doors They pull the gurney next to the
examination bed unstrap the restraints grab Sam’s legs and
begin to move him to the next bed

Now’s his chance Quickly Sam opens his eyes and viciously
kicks one orderly in the face The orderly stumbles back and
Sam leaps onto him Fumbling for a taser the orderly takes
a headbutt to the face Sam grabs the taser and pushes it

into the orderly’s neck until he slumps over The other
orderly injects Sam in the neck with a syringe but Sam
turns and hits him with the taser as well

Finlay surprised and nervous backs into a corner With the
orderlies incapacitated Sam turns his attention to him

Slow down Sam

SAM
Where’s Forrest

to figure it out from there

If you get out you tell the cops

SHRILL HUM penetrates every pore of his body He looks to
his left and can see through a window -- Annie is in the
kitchen getting beaten by Oliver Drudging up every last
ounce of fight in him he crawls toward her

Forrest’s eyes widen as Bodie dies beside him He sees that
Macy is still standing as he slips into darkness

The SHRILL HUM shuts off and there is a beat of silence

INT FURY FACILITY - SECLUSION ROOM - DAY

His eyes wet with tears Sam squats in the corner of a
small isolated room lit only by a thin shaft of light It’s
the type of room where screams simply return to you It’s
unclear if Sam’s waiting on another opportunity to escape or
simply waiting to die

The door opens Sam shrinks from the light spilling in
Sandeen enters and sits down in the corner across from Sam

SAM
What do you want
SANDEEN
I simply want to talk

Sam smirks

SANDEEN
I want to know if you pray Sam

SAM
I used to

SANDEEN
For yourself

Sam’s silent

SANDEEN
That doesn’t surprise me You know
it sounds cliché but my
grandfather used to send me out to
break limbs off the trees when he
wanted to punish me That man was a
virtuoso with those things I used
to pray the whole way to the tree
and the whole way back that he
would change his mind And you know
what Sam it never worked Not
once So you know what I did

SAM
What did you do

SANDEEN
I got angry I funneled every
single drop of it and one day I got
the most impressive stick my
12-year-old hands could break off
went back in the house and tried to
break every bone in his body Do
you understand what happened that
day Sam I didn’t need to pray any
more because in that moment I
became the Father the Son and the
Holy Ghost all rolled into one

SAM
If you’ve come to kill me youve
got your work cut out for you

SANDEEN
You still don’t understand Sam I
don’t want to kill you I want to
show people what fear anger

someone I need to see how far
someone can go

SAM
What are you talking about

SANDEEN
(jumping up getting excited)
You were weak Sam You had to have
recognized that The war broke you
and I took a man who had no
direction no drive no ambition
and look at what he’s become

SAM
Shut up

SANDEEN
Oliver wasn’t the only one I
wanted to see how it affected you
Sam You’re the extension the
second generation of a beautiful
work

Sam is noticeably upset

SANDEEN
Why do you think I let you in here
That escape attempt was fantastic
by the way It’s obvious that your
anger your guilt they’ve turned
you into strength Own that Be
proud of that I don’t want to kill
you because you sir are my finest
creation to date And in just a few
short days they’1ll be many more
becoming strong just like you

Sandeen knocks on the door

SAM

Do you think I’m afraid of you
SANDEEN

Not yet But there’s always

tomorrow

Sandeen leans down -- face to face with Sam

SANDEEN
Boo

Sandeen laughs as the door opens and there’s a doctor and
team of orderlies waiting

SANDEEN
(to the doctor)
Maintain a high dosage

The orderlies storm into the room and hold down Sam He is
wild and emotional fighting with whatever strength he has
left but the orderlies overpower him The doctor gives him
an injection in his arm and fits the helmet on him Sam

Finally driven by emotion he breaks it

Sam runs in as the TRIGGER SONG from the RADIO PLAYS louder
and louder He tackles Annie’s attacker and they struggle
and crash around the kitchen Finally Sam pins the
attacker picks up the hammer and starts to swing but stops
-- instead of the attacker being Oliver Sam sees himself

He’s stunned and confused He drops the hammer and puts his
hands over his ears He focuses and slowly the TRIGGER SONG
from the RADIO becomes QUIETER

He stumbles out of the house ANNIE’S SCREAMS resume as Sam
ignores them and resolutely walks down the street

Forrest wrestles free from Sam charges Macy again and
doubles her over with a kick Sam jumps back in front of him
and raises his gun at Forrest

Sam we have to hurry

ears and starts rocking back and forth The CHEERS of the
CROWD get louder as fighters fall above them

MACY
She maintains her innocence --

FORREST

Stop talking like that
(to Sam)
They knew we were planning an
escape I’m telling you Sam she’s
been with Sandeen the whole time

Sam lowers his gun When he does Macy quickly and catlike
leaps on Shanna takes her gun and puts it to Shanna’s
temple The patients scatter as she stares at Sam and
Forrest Her innocence is gone Her demeanor becomes cold

(ice cold)
Drop the gun and get on the lift

Macy fires a shot past Sam The GUN BLAST is muffled by the
CROWD NOISE above Sam drops his gun and kicks it to Macy

MACY
Get on the lift I swear to God
I’1l put a bullet in her brain
before you can blink

Forrest starts to charge her again but Sam holds him back

SAM
Let her go Macy

seconds

Sam and Forrest step onto the lift A fighter crashes down
on the floor above them and blood drips through the grates
and onto Sam’s shoulder Once they’re on Macy pushes Shanna
to them Gun still raised Macy backs up and switches a
lever that causes the lift to rise up to the

Shanna looks nervous as the lift rises revealing the top
side of the arena floor an inch at a time

SAM
(to Shanna)
Stay close

Shanna nods as the lift clicks into place The CROWD ERUPTS
upon seeing new fighters on the floor

FORREST
Here we go

Immediately they’re charged by two wild-eyed fighters

SAM
(to Shanna)
Stay back
Forrest doesn’t waste time -- he runs and viciously tackles

one of the fighters in a way that makes the crowd’s insides
ache Sam plays it more defensively ducks a couple of wild
punches and throws his attacker to the ground The attacker
jumps back up grabs Sam’s legs and takes him down

He grips Sam’s neck but almost instantly freshly painted
nails are dug in the attacker’s eyes The fighter climbs
off giving Sam an opportunity to jump up and knock him out
with a knee to the face

SAM
(catching his breath)
Thanks

the GRINDING of the LIFTS as they rise Sam sees a host of
fighters coming up and grabs Shanna’s arm

(looking up at the top level
of the arena)
We have to get to the top

The lifts click into place and the CROWD absolutely GOES
CRAZY when the floor floods with more fighters Sam Forrest
and Shanna sprint to the first catapult platform to get to
one of the second level platforms Just before they reach
the platform they are stopped in their tracks as the
TRIGGER SONG booms through the INTERCOM All the fighters
grab their heads and start wailing -- screams of pain and
anger -- a cacophony of human emotion

Flashes of Annie’s murder try to dominate Sam’s thinking as
he covers his ears and fights through it He runs over to
Forrest grabs his face and looks into his eyes

SAM
Look at me Forrest Fight this I
need you right now Don’t let
Sandeen in your head

Forrest desperately trying to focus finally nods

SAM
Let’s go We have to get to the

platform and start making their way to the top level as the

gamblers Gamblers trampling gamblers trying to get out
GUNSHOTS RING out People are screaming

Complete disorder and utter confusion -- the purest
definition of chaos

Sam Shanna and Forrest continue to fight people off when
Sam looks up and sees Sandeen leaving his luxury box Fire
returns to his eyes

SAM
Forrest keep her safe You
concentrate and focus on what
youre fighting for Don’t let
Sandeen in your head You hear me

Forrest nods

SHANNA
We have to find Sandeen

SAM
Stay with him

SHANNA
What are you going to do

SAM
Act like a coyote

Sam leaps off the top level and starts fighting his way back
down the structure Slowly but with aplomb he fights and
claws his way toward the grandstands He finally reaches
them He pushes his way up the stairs and down the hallway
in search of Sandeen

EXT TIMES SQUARE - LATE NIGHT

Times Square is a sea of glittering multi-color pom-poms
camera flashes and bright balloons Continuous MUSIC BOOMS
as the crowd anticipates the ball dropping

The Bearded Man stands next to a young couple who have
brought their five-year-old daughter to this once ina
lifetime event

The Sorority girls are still partying when the NYPD Officer
approaches and grabs the beers out of their hands

NYPD OFFICER
No alcohol

The girls pout for a second but then laughter takes over
INT FURY FACILITY - ARENA - LATE NIGHT

Robert is wading through the chaos toward Shanna Two of his
guys are leading the way smashing fighters with their
shotguns and firing if necessary

CHAN LAI

A catlike Chan Lai negotiates through the chaos like a
professional Finally she sees Robert and sprints to cut
him off

When she gets close she leaps and in one deadly yet
graceful move kicks one of Robert’s men in the face
disarms him and -- BOOM -- SHOOTS the other in the chest

Robert swings and knocks the gun out of her hand Chan Lai
responds with an open palm blow to Robert’s chest which
makes him lose his grip on his own gun and stumble back

SHANNA

Forrest and Shanna are doing all they can to maintain their
strategic high ground when she notices Robert on the arena
floor She does a double take but there’s no question She
runs to the steps that lead to the lower levels but Forrest
grabs her arm

FORREST
Where are you going We need to
stay here

SHANNA
My father’s down there

Forrest looks and though he doesn’t like it he knows what
they need to do

FORREST
Stay behind me

Without hesitation Forrest starts barreling down the
stairs running through anyone who gets in his way like a
linebacker Shanna stays close behind

ROBERT

Chan Lai is lightning fast but Robert although older is
huge and old-school tough Robert throws a couple of mighty
punches at Chan Lai but she ducks and dodges all of them
She kicks him in the knee forcing him down on the other
Robert clutches his knee -- excruciating pain -- but climbs
back to his feet hobbled

MAINFRAME ROOM

Sandeen runs back into the mainframe room most of the
workers have fled Ms Bata is still there

SANDEEN
Have the actives been triggered

MS BATA
(trying to keep it together)
We just finished coordinating with
all the on-site monitors The
authorization codes just need
inputted and it’1ll begin

Sandeen studies the sea of video monitors He looks up and
reads Ms Bata’s face

SANDEEN
(disgusted)
Go

Ms Bata scurries out of the room Sandeen sits alone in the
mainframe room furiously inputting codes into a computer

EXT TIMES SQUARE - LATE NIGHT

The huge lighted ball descends as the CROWD COUNTS DOWN
CLOSE ON the Bearded Man the NYPD Officer and the Sorority
Girl as the clock strikes midnight and the TRIGGER SONG

begins to BLAST from the SOUND SYSTEM All three grab their
ears and begin screaming

INT FURY FACILITY - ARENA - LATE NIGHT

Chan Lai connects with a flurry of blazing fast punches that
continue to stagger Robert He falls and reaches for his
shotgun but Chan Lai kicks it up to herself before he can
grasp it Before he can react she smashes the butt of the
gun into his face -- knocking him out

SHANNA AND FORREST

Shanna makes it to the arena floor and sprints to Robert
however as Forrest begins to follow he sees Macy running
across the third level of the structure He looks at Shanna
but vengeance and anger well up inside him The intense
stare returns as he goes after what he really wants -- Macy

ROBERT

Chan Lai far from exhausted looks down at Robert and
smiles She points the shotgun at his chest

Out of nowhere Shanna flies in and tackles Chan Lai
causing the shotgun to skitter across the floor Both women
get up and the phrase ‘hell hath no fury’ has no greater
application than at this moment

Shanna swings first with two hands -- like a mace Chan Lai
dodges and follows with a knee to the ribs Shanna winces
but is able to hit Chan Lai with a vicious backhand

HALLWAY

Sam focused and determined marches down the hall as
employees are scattering He finds Sandeen’s office and
bursts in Helin spins around They stare at each other for
a beat

MAINFRAME ROOM

Sandeen is still sitting at the computer The door swings
open He glances up from his keyboard to see Helin enter

SANDEEN
(looking back down)
Apricot I told you to stay put

HELIN
Julian

Sandeen looks up again and sees that Sam has her arm behind
her back and his roughing knife at her neck They move into
the room Fear crosses Sandeen’s face as he stands

SANDEEN
Well then

Tense beat

SANDEEN
What’s your play Sam

SAM
It’s over

SANDEEN
(glancing at the monitors)
Oh contrary to your shockingly
under-articulated opinion it’s
actually quite far from being over

Sam glances at the monitors and a look of horror crosses his
face He sees former Whitestone Wellness patients all over
Times Square writhing from the Trigger Song Sam knows where
this is going to lead in just a few short seconds

SAM
Shut it down

SANDEEN
That’s an extremely unrealistic
thing to ask don’t you think

SAM
(tightening his grip on Helin)
For Gods sake I’m not playing
with you

SANDEEN
God For God’s sake Really

HELIN
Julian stop it

SANDEEN
Now tell me Sam is this the part
where you tell me I’m out of
options and there’s no way out

SAM
This is the part where I show you
what it feels like to have a dead
wife I really don’t care what you
call it

HELIN
Julian do something

SANDEEN

You know what That’s the best idea
youve had all day But I don’t
know if you’ve considered
something How in fact do you
hurt someone who wants to feel
pain

(to Helin)
I’m sorry puppy pot

Sandeen draws the pistol he had hidden in his waistband and
shoots Helin in the stomach The look of shock and confusion
on her face is haunting as she slumps to the floor staring
in disbelief at the blood soaking her shirt

EXT TIMES SQUARE - LATE NIGHT

The Bearded Man screams and writhes the man next to him
hands his daughter to his wife and goes to check on him

The NYPD Officer tears in his eyes eyes his gun

The Sorority Girl sees a beer bottle on the ground and picks
it up

INT FURY FACILITY - MAINFRAME ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Sandeen genuinely looks moved at the sight of Helin dying in
front of him He looks back at Sam and drops his gun

SANDEEN
(tears flowing)
I glory in what Annie’s death has
done to you Sam Why wouldn’t I
want it for myself

Not knowing what else to do Sam screams and tackles
Sandeen Quickly though Sandeen viciously bites Sam’s
cheek Sam screams but Sandeen is animalistic and
relentless Sam finally pulls away -- he’s bleeding
Sandeen’s face is a mixture of blood and tears

SHANNA

Chan Lai has Shanna in a chokehold but Shanna drives her
head back into Chan Lai’s face The two women continue to
fight -- Chan Lai with obvious training and precision and
Shanna with sheer determination

FORREST

Forrest moves quickly across the fighting arena and once on
the third level he sees Macy trying to hide She finally
sees Forrest as he approaches Fear fills her face

As he reaches her two attackers fly from the top level and
topple him to the ground He stands and viciously defends
against the two fighters He knocks one out cold with a
headbutt and grabs the other by the arm and slings him over
the edge like a rag doll But as the fighter falls off the
edge he grabs Forrest’s leg and pulls him over the edge
with him

Macy darts to the edge and sees Forrest hanging on for dear
life -- a fatal fall to the arena floor underneath him

FORREST
Macy Help

SAM
Sam with his cheek bloodied throws Sandeen around the
room but oddly Sandeen isn’t fighting back -- he’s

enjoying it

SAM
Youre going to stop this

Sandeen looks up at Sam with a bloody smile

SANDEEN
We’re making a better world Sam

Sam enraged throws Sandeen to the ground and pummels him
-- punch after punch after punch

EXT TIMES SQUARE - LATE NIGHT

The Sorority Girl quickly spins and smashes the bottle in
the face of the Blonde Friend who is trying to help her

The NYPD Officer pulls his gun and waves it at the crowd
The Bearded Man grabs the man who is helping him and
viciously throws him into a street light The wife screams

as the Bearded Man turns his attention the five-year-old

The CAMERA FLIES UP and hundreds of people can be seen
snapping and attacking others

INT FURY FACILITY - ARENA - LATE NIGHT
Macy takes a beat and looks at Forrest hanging

FORREST
Macy help me up Grab my arm

Nothing
FORREST
How long were we together How long
did I try to protect you Come on

Macy considers

FORREST
I know that wasn’t for nothing

MACY
(finally softening)
I didn’t want that for Bodie

FORREST
Okay

MACY
I didn’t want him to die He was my
friend

FORREST

Fine Now grab my hand Hurry

Macy finally reaches down and grabs Forrest’s hand to pull
him to safety But instead of climbing back up Forrest
with steel-cold eyes looks her in the face and pulls her
over the edge They both free fall to the arena floor

SHANNA

Shanna and Chan Lai trade punches and both bloody and
exhausted go for the shotgun on the floor Chan Lai is
there first but Shanna is on her pinning her down Four
hands one GUN and -- BANG -- wild shot

Still wrestling Shanna breaks Chan Lai’s nose and the gun
is knocked away again Chan Lai flips Shanna over and now is
on top their hands locked around each other’s throats

Shanna looks to Robert who is still unconscious

This is as real as it gets
SAM

Sam wildly beats Sandeen who still isn’t fighting back He
picks a bloodied Sandeen up and throws him across a table
He screams in frustration Sam exhausted picks up the gun
from the floor and presses it against Sandeen’s forehead

SAM
Tell me how to shut it down

SANDEEN
Why would I do that

Sam presses the gun in harder

SAM
Because you’re too arrogant to want
to die like this Alone No blaze
of glory No pageantry Quick and
painless Is that what you want

Sandeen listens the wheels in his deranged mind turning
Blood gurgles up as he laughs

SAM
Your call

Sam presses harder on the gun and on the trigger as panicked
realization finally washes over Sandeen’s face

SANDEEN
Wait wait I can stop it

SAM
Do it

EXT TIMES SQUARE - LATE NIGHT

The crowd is in full-blown panic as people are being
attacked all around

INT FURY FACILITY - MAINFRAME ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Sam picks himself up pulling Sandeen up Sandeen sits down
grabs a pen and scratches a code on a piece of paper

SANDEEN
(sliding the paper toward Sam)
Input this into that computer and
it’ll send out the hum that will
drop everyone Even you

Sam takes the paper and points the gun at Sandeen
SANDEEN
Wait a minute Sam What if I gave
you the wrong code If you kill me
and it doesn’t work you don’t have
another play

Point taken

SAM
You’re not going to walk away from
all this

SANDEEN

That’s up to you

SAM
This is all going to come back at
you one way or another

SANDEEN
Possibly If it were me --

SAM
I’m not you

Sandeen spits out a couple of teeth

SANDEEN
I guess we’ll see

Tense beat Sam looks at the carnage on the monitors and
then back at Sandeen Finally he smashes Sandeen with the
gun -- knocking him out Then he quickly takes the paper and
inputs the code

The SHRILL HUM blares throughout the facility INTERCOM as
well as throughout Times Square Sam grabs his ears
fighting to stay awake Finally Sam drops unconscious

EXT TIMES SQUARE - LATE NIGHT

Once the HUM begins BLARING the attackers including the
Bearded Man the NYPD Officer and the Sorority Girl all
collapse -- unconscious

INT FURY FACILITY - ARENA - LATE NIGHT

Chan Lai chokes Shanna but looks up as the SHRILL HUM drops
all the fighters in the arena and in the grandstands

Out of nowhere Robert’s giant boot smashes into Chan Lai’s
face -- knocking her out Shanna struggles to catch her
breath as Robert helps her up Exhausted she stands over
Chan Lai unconscious fighters all around
SHANNA

I don’t know if you’re dead but if
you’re not you’re under arrest

MAINFRAME ROOM

Sandeen and Sam lie on the floor

It’s almost peaceful

Finally Sandeen stirs and pulls himself up He’s badly
injured but mobile He looks at Sam disappointed

SANDEEN
Well then

He turns and walks out

EXT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - LATE NIGHT

Sandeen hobbled bloodied and
he can out of the front of the

injured limps as quickly as

fumbles through a set of keys
phone

SANDEEN

He dials a number on his

A small army of ambulances police cars and FBI vehicles

arrested gamblers are giving statements body bags are
being carried out etc

Sam bruised and injured sits alone on a curb staring
ahead -- his hands stained with dried blood most of which
isn’t his own Shanna approaches and sits down next to him

Beat as they both take in the enormity of what just
happened

SHANNA
What you did was pretty much the
most foolish thing I’ve ever seen
You put a lot of people in danger

SAM
A lot of people were already in
danger

SHANNA

You put yourself in danger

SAM
Well you met me at a very strange
time in my life

Shanna smirks

SAM
What happened to Sandeen

SHANNA
We don’t know

Sam shakes his head

SHANNA
We know where he lives We know
where his plane is He can’t hide
for long We’1ll find him

SAM
Is Forrest going to be alright

SHANNA
(looking away)
He didn’t make it Sam
Sam drops his head He would be upset right now if he didn’t
feel so numb

SAM
What happens now

SHANNA
The Whitestone folks are being
rounded up now Homeland Security’s
swarming New York rounding up the
attackers They have to try to undo
what Sandeen did to them

SAM
What happens to me

SHANNA
Same thing I guess

SAM
(contemplative)
What if they can’t undo what
Sandeen did to me

Shanna doesn’t know what to say

SAM
I have a dog His name’s Crouton

Shanna can’t help but laugh

SHANNA
Crouton

SAM
I let my wife name him I’d like to
get my dog back

Shanna feels bad for laughing She looks up and sees Chan
Lai handcuffed being put in a police car She also sees
Robert being questioned by a federal agent They share a
look -- one of thankfulness and respect

SHANNA
Listen thanks for what you did for
me in there

SAM
I should be thanking you for coming
after me
SHANNA
It’s all part of the job

SAM
What a way to ring in the New Year

They share a smile as the FEDERAL AGENT that was questioning
Robert approaches Shanna

FEDERAL AGENT
Deputy we’re going to have to get
a statement from you

Shanna nods and gets up wincing from her various bumps and
bruises PURSER runs up

PURSER
Shanna they found Sandeen

Sam jumps up as he and Shanna share a surprised look

SHANNA
Where

PURSER
Found his body in front of the
building He was shot in the chest

Sam looks at Shanna -- confused

SHANNA
Who shot him

PURSER
Don’t know They just found him
lying there

SAM
He’s dead

PURSER
Oh yeah He’s extremely dead

FADES TO BLACK
EXT WHITESTONE WELLNESS INSTITUTE - EARLIER
Preacher puts down his whiskey climbs into the bed of his
pickup truck points his RIFLE and FIRES a shot into the
side of the building He’s wobbly on his feet and quite

drunk so the recoil throws him backward

It’s very dark and visibility is poor because of the fog
that blankets the area
PREACHER
(drunk mumbling to himself)
As I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death

Preacher raises his rifle again

PREACHER
I will fear no evil

BANG

Sandeen reaches his car and as he puts the keys in he’s
blown backward by the gun shot -- square in the chest
Preacher however is oblivious he hit anything

PREACHER
‘Cause every time evil shows his
squirrely little face I’m gonna’
be shootin’ Ain’t meant to be his
valley Meant to be ours

POLICE SIRENS sound in the background Preacher hears the
sirens and puts his gun down

PREACHER
Alright Miss Shanna No need to
wake the snakes I’m goin’

Preacher gets in his truck and pulls away as Sandeen slowly
bleeds out in the parking lot

His spirit and life leave him not furiously or with pomp
but slowly and uneventfully

A mild look of panic flashes across his face as he takes his
last breath on the pavement -- cold alone and emotionless

The CAMERA FLIES UPWARD to show the whole parking lot then
the Whitestone Wellness Institute and then the reservation
before everything

FADES TO BLACK
