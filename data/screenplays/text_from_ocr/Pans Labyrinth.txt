A female voice hums a sweet lullaby

SUPERIMPOSITION

SPAIN 1944

THE CIVIL WAR IS OVER

HIDDEN IN THE MOUNTAINS ARMED MEN FIGHT THE NEW
FASCIST REGIME MILITARY POSTS ARE ESTABLISHED TO
EXTERMINATE THE RESISTANCE

Then the raw raspy SOUND ofa child struggling to breathe

FADE IN
EXT LABYRINTH - NIGHT

In the foreground OFELIA - 11 years old skin white as
snow ruby lips and ebony hair - is sprawled on the ground

A thick ribbon of blood runs from her nose

But - the blood is flowing backward into her nostril Drop
by drop the blood leaps up and disappears

Ofelias pupils dilate-

NARRATOR
Long ago in the Underground Realm

CAMERA MOVES INTO THE DARK PUPIL-

BLACK SCREEN

NARRATOR
where there are no lies or pain there
lived a Princess who dreamt of the human
world
The sound of muffled wind

NARRATOR
She dreamt of blue skies the soft breeze
and sunshine

A dark CASTLE takes shape Here a tower there a
turret and lighted windows

Finally the damp mildewed walls of a water well come into
focus

NARRATOR
One day eluding her keepers the
Princess escaped

A womans silhouette crosses CAMERA-

NARRATOR
Once outside the brightness blinded her
and erased her memory

A circular staircase leads up toward daylight where the
image

NARRATOR
She forgot who she was and where she came
from Her body suffered cold sickness
and pain Eventually she died

FADES TO WHITE

EXT BOMBED CITY - DAY

CAMERA TRACKS past scenes of destruction bombed-out
buildings cathedrals in ruins

NARRATOR
Her father the King always knew that
the Princess would return perhaps in
another body in another place at
another time

On half-demolished walls Falangist posters declare Francos
triumph Among the ruins smaller poignant traces of war
shoes broken eye-glasses

NARRATOR
And he would wait for her until he drew
his last breath until the world stopped
turning

Through the ruined buildings a SMALL CARAVAN OF BLACK
BENTLEY CARS comes into view

The shiny chrome fenders pass directly by CAMERA they bear
all the Fascist insignias and flags

INT MAIN CAR - SAME
Looking out the window OFELIA

Shes dressed in plain slightly frayed clothing Not very
dainty On her lap is a book of fairy tales

CAMERA studies one of the watercolors that adorn the pages
an illustration of a little girl dancing with several
fairies flying around her

At her side a small pile of similar books in a book strap

CARMEN
I dont understand why you had to bring
so many books Ofelia

Ofelia turns her gaze toward the opposite seat where her
mother CARMEN 28 is napping her enormous stomach
evidence of advanced pregnancy She too has black hair

CARMEN
Were going to the country the
outdoors plenty of fresh air

She takes the book away from Ofelia
CARMEN

Fairy tales Youre too old to be filling
your head with such nonsense
She pauses feeling nausea

CARMEN
Ask them to stop the car- please-

Ofelia knocks on the partition window of the sedan The
Driver stops

EXT WOODS - SAME

The caravan of cars stops Carmen hurriedly climbs down and
moves to the front of the main car

Gasping for air she battles the nausea Ofelia timidly
approaches her

CARMEN
Ofelia wait up

She grabs her pregnant abdomen

CARMEN
Your brothers not well

Ofelia nods and moves away SERRANO a military man climbs
out of the car behind them and approaches Carmen solicitous

SERRANO
Madam are you feeling ill

CARMEN
Water- just a bit of water-

SERRANO
(to one of his men)
Water bring water for the Captains
wife

Ofelia walks alongside the road moving into the woods and
further away from the caravan of cars

CAMERA surveys the heavy forest a tangled tapestry of moss
and fog
The trees swayed by the wind murmur softly around Ofelia
She stumbles upon a strange stone by the side of the road

Roughly the size of a fist- carved on it the outline of a
human EYE

Fascinated the young girl picks it up

She looks around and finds -amidst the shrubs- an ancient
stone monolith incised with Celtic lettering

Its crowned with the grotesque face of a satyr- mouth open
wide

A piece of the brutish face is missing an eye

Ofelia fits the piece of engraved stone in the missing area
A perfect fit

From inside the statue a clicking noise emerges The wind
picks up and-

-out of the satyrs open mouth a STICK INSECT lazily crawls
out Ofelia smiles The insect climbs atop the stone head
and studies the girl for a moment Then-

CARMEN
Ofelia

The sound of Carmens voice startles the creature which flies
off

Ofelia runs to her mothers side

OFELIA
(enthusiastic)
A fairy- I saw a fairy

CARMEN
Oh- look at your shoes Theyre covered
in mud

They head back to the caravan

CARMEN
When we get to the mill I want you to
greet Captain Vidal

That man- has been very good to us
darling You have no idea-

So I want you to call him Father Do
you hear me Father

Its just a word Ofelia

The Stick Insect lands in a nearby tree and observes inquisitively
as Mother and daughter climb into the main car and head off

A beat later the Stick Insect flies after them

CUT TO

INT WATER MILL - DAY

CLOSE-UP a gold pocket watch on a heavy chain The glass
dial is cracked

A gloved THUMB snaps the cover shut A VOICE - CAPTAIN VIDAL
- mutters in irritation

VIDAL
Fifteen minutes late

ANGLE WIDENS to describe a dilapidated WATER MILL

The site consists of a pair of dark stone buildings with
corrugated roofs connected to the mill by a small stone
bridge A large water wheel hangs over the dry riverbed

The wooden beams and columns bear sculpted Celtic motifs and
here and there small odd carved creatures

The walls have been reinforced with hundreds of sand-bags
and wooden pontoons as if preparing for an attack

CAPTAIN VIDAL and a small group of SERVANTS and SOLDIERS
wait patiently outside
SOLDIER
Captain Theyre here-

The caravan of Bentleys stops in front of the building Vidal
and his group moves in Servants and Soldiers unload luggage
withy military efficiency In charge is MERCEDES a young
but strict country woman

Vidal greets Carmen

VIDAL
Carmen- Welcome-

With a pleasant smile he touches her pregnant belly and
then points at a wooden wheelchair pushed to Carmens side
by a small nervous man SGT GARCES By his side stands
DOCTOR FERREIRO a pleasant scholarly man in his mid
forties

CARMEN
I- I dont need it- I can walk by myself

VIDAL
Doctor Ferreiro prefers that you dont
exert yourself

CARMEN
N-no

Vidal leans towards her and whispers -ever so softly- in her
ear

VIDAL
Then do it for me

She obeys As she sits Ofelia exits the automobile holding
her books close to her chest

CARMEN
Ofelia Greet the Captain

She is wheeled away An awkward silence passes between the
young girl and the Captain

VIDAL
Ofelia-
The girl extends her hand He grabs it firm but cold It is
her left hand

VIDAL
Its the other hand Ofelia

He turns to the servants
VIDAL
Mercedes take my wifes luggage to her

room-

MERCEDES
Yes sir

Mercedes glances back to find Ofelia curiously gazing at-
-a pile of sandbags Perched on top-
-the big Stick Insect

It fans out its multiple wings Twice Ofelia runs over and
tries to catch it

But the Stick Insect takes off and escapes The girl drops her
books and goes after it

EXT GARDENS - FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
Ofelia follows the Stick Insect to the edge of a small rise

She follows it with her eyes and sees about 100 meters
away surrounded by trees the ruins of a garden LABYRINTH

The CAMERA glides up for a better view The labyrinth is
circular its paths overgrown and partially blocked

Ofelia enters the labyrinth through an archway She ventures
down one of its pathways and stops-

MERCEDES
Its a labyrinth-
Ofelia turns- the young woman stands by her side Ofelias
books in hand

MERCEDES
Just a pile of old stones
Theyve always been there even before
the mill Better you dont go near it-
You could get lost

A ray of sunlight breaks through the grey clouds and
illuminates the old ruins Mercedes hands her the books

OFELIA
Thank you

MERCEDES
Have you read them all

Garcés shouts from the mill

GARCES
Mercedes
(Mercedes reacts)
The Captain’s calling you

Mercedes makes a small gesture of goodbye to Ofelia

MERCEDES
Your father needs me

She turns and walks away-

OFELIA
Hes not my father

Mercedes doesnt understand The girl runs up to her

OFELIA
The Captain- hes not my father My
father was a tailor He died in the war
The Captains not my father

Mercedes cant help but smile at the girls sudden
vehemence

MERCEDES
Well youve made that clear enough
They walk away together

OFELIA
Did you see my mother
(Mercedes nods)
Shes pretty isnt she
(Mercedes nods)
You saw her belly Shes sick with child

As they go into the house the Stick Insect - perched atop
the labyrinths archway - monitors their every move

CUT TO

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

VIDAL
The guerillas are sticking to the woods
because its hard to track them down up
there

Vidal is standing at an enormous dining table Serrano
Garcés and a few lower-ranking officials surround him

VIDAL
Those pricks know the terrain better than
any of us We need to force them down -

Vidal sticks pins into one of the larger maps

VIDAL
-lets block their access to medicine and
supplies

Mercedes enters bearing a tray of olives cold cuts and a
bottle of Orujo liquor

VIDAL
Well set up three command posts Here

here and here

Mercedes glances briefly at the maps concealing avid
interest
Suddenly Vidal grabs Mercedes by the arm

VIDAL
Have Dr Ferreiro come see me

MERCEDES
Yes Sir

Turning his attention back to his maps Vidal takes two
olives and pops them into his mouth

VIDAL
(chewing)
Those bastards are going to starve
youll see

INT UPPER BEDROOM - DUSK

The doctor stirs some drops of medicine into a glass of
water Carmen lies back in a monumental carved bed On her
lap there are several playing cards

DOCTOR
Just four drops at bedtime and youll
sleep all night long

He gives her the water and the medicine vial Carmen drinks
weakly Ofelia stands by her side

DOCTOR
Dont hesitate to call if you need
anything Madame You- or your little
nurse

He grins at Ofelia then exits the room Carmen gives Ofelia
the medicine vial

CARMEN
Go Close the door so I can sleep
INT FOYERSTAIRWAY - NIGHT

In the hallway the doctor finds Mercedes waiting for him
They proceed in silence down the hallway and look down into
the foyer empty

MERCEDES
You must come up the mountain and see him-
the leg wound- its getting worse

The doctor nods timidly and gives Mercedes a small PACKAGE
wrapped in dark paper and neatly tied in string

DOCTOR
This is all I could get Im sorry

Mercedes sighs disappointed

MERCEDES
Hes downstairs- dont keep him waiting

The doctor moves downstairs Mercedes glances toward the
Upper Bedroom and-

-discovers Ofelia watching her attentively- how long has
she been there

The girl closes the door quietly

INT UPPER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Ofelia takes off her shoes and climbs into her mothers bed
As she cuddles close to her mother-

CARMEN
Jesus- Your feet- theyre frozen

She caresses Ofelias head The wind picks up and the house
timbers moan and creak

CARMEN
Are you scared
OFELIA
A little bit

OFELIA
Whats that noise

CARMEN
Nothing just the wind Nights here are
different from city nights There you
hear cars trains Here the houses are
old and creaky

The house utters a series of deep rumbling noises

CARMEN
Almost like theyre speaking

Tomorrow Im going to give you something
special

OFELIA
A book

CARMEN
No something much better

A beat of silence and then-

OFELIA
Why did you have to get married

CARMEN
We were alone too long

OFELIA
You werent alone You were never alone

CARMEN
When youre older youll understand It
hasnt been easy for me

She winces in pain-
CARMEN

Your brothers- hes acting up Tell him
one of your stories so hell calm down
Ofelia gently leans on her mothers stomach and taps it with
one finger as if it were a telegraph key

CARMEN
My brother my brother

Carmen closes her eyes and listens to her daughters voice-

OFELIA
along long time ago in a grey sad
country

INSIDE THE STOMACH

Floating in a limbo of amniotic fluid the BABY opens his
eyes and listens

OFELIA
There was a magic rose that made whoever
plucked it immortal

EXT MAGICAL MOUNTAIN - SUNSET

Against a scarlet sky a BLUE ROSE Its thorny stem clutches
the dagger-like crest of a black granite mountain

The thorns grow around the granite like suffocating
serpents

OFELIA (VO)
But no one would dare go near it because
its thorns were full of mortal poison

The Stick Insect lands on one of the thorns and then flies off
into the night sky-

OFELIA (VO)
So amongst the men tales of pain and
death were told in hushed voices But
there was no talk of eternal life
because men fear pain more than they
want immortality

-up up and then through-

EXT GARDENS - TWILIGHT
-the WINDOW of the Upper Bedroom

Through the glass the Stick Insect observes how Ofelia hugs her
mother

OFELIA
So every day the rose wilted unable to
bequeath his gift to anyone--

The Stick Insect clicks its jaws in excitement

CUT TO

INT VIDALS STUDY - DAY

The improvised office is in one of the lower rooms where
the gigantic mill wheel and the wooden gears lie in a heap

OFELIA (VO)
Alone and forgotten at the top of that
mountain Forgotten until the end of
time

Small steel gears shine like metallic stars on a small
swatch of black velvet

Tweezers pick them up and-

-put them into place within the workings of a watch

Using a jewelers magnifying glass Vidal oils and closes up
his pocket watch while he listens to cuplé (traditional

Spanish music) on a phonograph

The doctor comes to the door Vidal motions for him to
enter
VIDAL
Come in-

How is she

DOCTOR
Very weak

Vidal closes the watch

VIDAL
Shell rest as much as she needs to Ill
sleep down here

And my son

DOCTOR
Your-

Serrano and Garcés enter the room

GARCES
Excuse us Captain

Vidal motions for them to be silent Then he looks at the
Doctor again

VIDAL
My son How is he

DOCTOR
For the moment theres no reason to be
alarmed

VIDAL
Good That’s good

DOCTOR
Captain

Your wife- she shouldnt have traveled
this late in the pregnancy

VIDAL
Is that your opinion
DOCTOR
My professional opinion yes sir

VIDAL
Well a boy should be born wherever his
father is And thats that

He heads for the door

DOCTOR
Captain

Vidal stops and looks at him fixedly
DOCTOR

One more thing sir What makes you so
sure its a boy

VIDAL
Dont fuck with me

He exits the mill

CUT TO

EXT MILL - NIGHT

The mill and the tents are silhouettes in the night
Soldiers patrol the gravel paths

Vidal Garcés and Serrano walk towards the outer Water
Wheel There a small group of soldiers surrounds an OLD MAN
and his young SON

GARCES
At 8 oclock we detected activity in the
southeastern sector Gunfire Sergeant
Bayona captured a suspect The other
prisoner is his son whos here from
town

SON
Captain my father is an honorable man

VIDAL
Tll decide that Take your hat off when
you talk to me

The Son quietly obeys BAYONA hands the Captain a small
gauge rifle and a leather pouch

VIDAL
We found this weapon Its been fired

SON
He was hunting rabbits -

VIDAL
Shut up damn it

Vidal takes opens the leather pouch and finds a farmers
almanac He reads an inscription printed on the back page

VIDAL
No God nor Government nor Master

GARCES
Red propaganda sir

SON
Its not propaganda Sir

Vidal impatiently motions for him to be silent

OLD MAN

Its an old almanac were farmers sir
VIDAL

Go on
OLD MAN

I was in the forest hunting rabbits for
my daughters Theyre sick

VIDAL
Rabbits uh

In the pouch Vidal finds a half-empty bottle of wine
SON
Captain if my father says so- he was
hunting rabbits

Vidal hands Garcés the pouch and moves towards the boy
bottle in hand

BAM Without warning he flattens the boys nose with the
bottle bottom The Father screams horrified but without
the guts to intervene

Vidal lifts the Son up bashes his nose again and again
leveling bone and cartilage

FATHER
No No You killed him You son ofa
bitch

Vidal drops the boy who falls to the ground spitting blood
He turns to the Father and shoots him twice in cold blood
then turns to the Son and shoots him once in the head

Then all is silence The distant whistle of a train can be
heard Vidal heads back towards Garcés and calmly searches
the pouch Inside he finds two scrawny rabbits

VIDAL
Learn to frisk these motherfuckers before
you come bothering me

GARCES
Yes my Captain

He moves away And he takes the rabbits with him

CUT TO

INT UPPER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eyes wide Ofelia hears a dry rattle followed by a soft
ululation at the window which is half open The curtains
billow
The mill groans Ofelia is restless
Then- a dry clicking noise

OFELIA
Mama wake up-

Carmen doesnt move A scuttling noise reaches her ears as
something small and quick skitters over the floor

OFELIA
Mother- please Theres something in the
room-

Impossible Ofelia gets up and carefully puts on her shoes

Something shifts in the ceiling beams Ofelia looks up
searching

Nothing Suddenly something the size of a human hand
scurries past her feet and hides under the bed

Then pulling at the goose down comforter the Stick Insect climbs
up into the bed Ofelia leans over it shocked

OFELIA
H-hello- Did you follow me here

The Stick Insect clicks its mandibles

OFELIA
Are you a fairy

The Stick Insect regards her with curiosity

OFELIA
Look- This is a fairy-

She picks up one of her books and opens it to an
illustration a beautiful fairy

The Stick Insect scrutinizes the illustration and sits upright It
opens and closes its wings transforming into a GREEN FAIRY -

a tiny human form with striped wings

The Green Fairy flies to the foot of the bed pointing to
the window
OFELIA
You want me to go with you Outside

Where

CUT TO

EXT GARDENS - NIGHT

The Green Fairy flies swiftly but Ofelia follows close
behind Suddenly it stops

They’re at the ruins of the labyrinth which is bathed in
moonlight

Trees and roots crowd the broken niches as if fused with

the stone Some of the pathways are blocked by gnarled trees
that have grown through the rock

LABYRINTH - CONTINUOUS

Ofelia runs through the narrow spooky pathways but she has
lost sight of the Green Fairy

Ofelia stops and looks around until she spots it waiting
for her at-

ROTUNDA AT CENTER OF LABYRINTH - NIGHT

The Green Fairy alights on an ancient monolith at the edge of an
empty stone pool Its decorated in Celtic lettering just

like the one in the forest

Another monolith stands at its center

Ofelia nears the edge of the pool

OFELIA
Hello
The pool returns her cry again and again The tree trunks
creak- and a cloud covers the moon

OFELIA
Echo Echo

Then she hears the sound of something big clattering about
on hooves like a horse or a bull

VOICE
Its you- Its you- Youve returned

The VOICE is cold and full of sibilance The cloud moves
aside

On its hind quarters in the shadows is the twisted and
sinister figure of a FAUN Hes covered in roots and moss

Ofelia backs away- speechless

FAUN
No- no- dont be afraid- I beg you
Look

He opens a small wicker basket and from it emerge two more
FAIRIES one BLUE one RED

Ofelia smiles

OFELIA
My name is Ofelia Who are you

FAUN
Me Ive had so many names Old names
that only the wind and the trees can
pronounce

The Green Fairy flies toward its colorful companions
FAUN
lam the mountain the forest and the

earth I am a faun

As he bows to her moonlight dapples his body His coarse
hooves and the strange angle of his legs make his courtly
manner clumsy yet oddly gracious

FAUN
Your Highness-
OFELIA
No Im -
FAUN
You are Princess Moanna daughter of the
King of the Underworld
OFELIA

No- My father was a tailor

FAUN
You are not born of man It was the moon
that bore you

Look on your left shoulder and you will
find a mark that proves it

Ofelia instinctively touches her shoulder with a strange
expression on her face

FAUN
Your real father had us open portals all
over the world to allow your return This
is the last of them

He opens his arm and gestures at the well around them

FAUN
But we have to make sure that your
essence is intact that you have not
become a mortal

To insure your return you have three
tasks to fulfill - before the moon is
full

The Faun steps back a few paces He deposits a large leather
bound book on the ground as well as a leather bag

FAUN
This is the Book of Crossroads Open it
when youre alone and it will show you
your future - show you what must be done

Then he and the Fairies fade back into the shadows

Ofelia goes to the book and opens it No matter how many
pages she turns-

-they are all blank

OFELIA
Theres nothing here-

But she is alone Absolutely alone in the well MUSIC starts-

Now alone in the massive dining room Vidal shines his
boots Methodically

This is obviously a daily ritual for him By his side the
two scrawny rabbits he impounded the night before

Mercedes brings him a cup of coffee
VIDAL
Mercedes prepare these rabbits for
dinner tonight

Mercedes eyes the scrawny animals-

MERCEDES
They are too young
VIDAL
Well see if theyll do for a stew

MERCEDES
Yes sir

She turns to leave but Vidal stops her gently

VIDAL
And- This coffee- was burnt Taste it
yourself

She does Vidal places a hand on her shoulder

There is something unpleasant about this sudden contact
something too familiar She bears it in silence

VIDAL
You should keep an eye on it

MERCEDES
Yes sir

She moves into-

INT KITCHEN - LATER

The kitchen is enormous The open charcoal cook stove is two
meters high by five meters wide

MERCEDES
(hands out the rabbits)

Two old stout cooks JACINTA and PAZ wash the gigantic
work table with boiling water

MERCEDES
(to the others)
He didnt like the coffee

JACINTA
Agh- Hes nothing but a fussy dandy A

CARMEN
Ofelia Your father is giving a dinner

party tonight Look what Ive made you

She lifts out a beautiful green dress in shiny silk and
ivory tulle
Ofelia studies the dress as if it were a strange artifact
rather than something she might wear Mercedes enters with a
break fast tray

CARMEN
Do you like it What I wouldnt have
given to have a dress as fine as this
when I was little

In a reverie Carmen takes out a pair of new patent leather
shoes and a green silk hair ribbon

CARMEN
(to Ofelia)
And look at these shoes Do you like
them

Ofelia makes an effort and smiles a weak smile

OFELIA
Yes they are very pretty

But Carmen is not fooled-

CARMEN
Go on now Take your bath Go-

Ofelia obeys- She enters-

INT BATHROOM UPPER BEDROOM - DAY

Ofelia alone in the bathroom opens the magical book At
first the page is blank but a wondrous image takes shape
Ofelia and five chestnuts Squatting at her side under a
huge tree a massive TOAD

Then a KNOCK on the door-

CARMENS VOICE
Ofelia-

INT UPPER BEDROOM - DAY
Alone now Carmen readies the little green dress

CARMEN
Hurry up I want to see the dress on you

On her right shoulder Ofelia examines exactly as the Faun
said a birthmark in the form of the crescent moon

CARMEN’S VOICE
Youll look like a princess-

Ofelia smiles

OFELIA
(to herself)
a princess

CUT TO

INT KITCHEN - LATER
Mercedes organizes the kitchen

MERCEDES
Make sure those chickens are cleaned
properly and the beans

Mercedes takes out a small sharp knife from the folds in
her apron She skillfully chops an onion

The bustle suddenly stops Everyone looks toward the door
where among chicken feathers floating like confetti Ofelia
stands dressed in green silk

CONCHITA
You look marvelous my girl just
gorgeous
JACINTA
What a dress

Mercedes smiles Shes pleased too but she claps her hands
together-

MERCEDES
Get back to work stop wasting time

They obey Mercedes goes next to Ofelia

MERCEDES
Do want some milk with honey

Ofelia nods eagerly

INT STABLE - LATER
Mercedes puts a bucket under a huge milk cow

MERCEDES
Step back I dont want you getting milk
on your dress with you looking so

pretty
Mercedes begins to milk the cow

OFELIA
Mercedes do you believe in fairies

MERCEDES
No But when I was a little girl I did

I believed in a lot of things that I
dont believe any more

OFELIA
Well last night a fairy visited me And
it wasnt alone there were lots of them -
and a faun too

MERCEDES
A faun
Mercedes picks up the bucket and fills a wooden bow with
milk

OFELIA
He was very old very tall and smelled
like dirt

MERCEDES
My mother warned me to be wary of fauns-

Suddenly Vidal and Garcés approach them

VIDAL
Mercedes come with me

EXT STORAGE BUILDING - MILL - DAY

Vidal and Mercedes walk toward the bodega or storage
building adjoining the mill

Guards unload giant sacks of provisions from trucks A Civil
Guard CAPITAN supervises the operation and greets Vidal

CAPITAN
Captain everything is here

INT BODEGA - MILL - CONTINUOUS

The men fill the enormous bodega with grain bottles of
wine barrels of oil salt and sugar etc

Vidal grabs a packet of tobacco

VIDAL
Tobacco huh Real tobacco
The CAPITAN hands over some papers with the Falangist
letterhead

Mercedes is stunned by the quantity of food and supplies
Vidal checks the padlock on the door

VIDAL
Mercedes the key-

MERCEDES

Mercedes hands over the key from her large key ring

VIDAL
(to Mercedes)
Is this the only copy

MERCEDES

Vidal locks the padlock Yanks on it nice and strong

VIDAL
From now on Ill carry it

From outside Serrano calls him

SERRANO

binoculars and points to something on the horizon-

SERRANO

Through the binoculars Vidal sees a plume of SMOKE on the
horizon

VIDAL

EXT FOREST - DAY

Garcés Vidal and a few of his men ride through the forest
on horseback

OFELIA (VO)
When the forest was young a fig tree
took root and grew to colossal size

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - DAY
Ofelia walks away from the mill and into the woods

OFELIA (VO)
When the forest was young it was home to
creatures who were full of magic and
wonder

EXT WOODS - DAY
Vidal and his men ride through the forest
OFELIA (VO)
At the heart of this forest stood a

colossal fig tree The Forest Folk slept
in its shadow

EXT EDGE OF THE FOREST - DAY
OFELIA (VO)
But now the tree is dying Its branches

are dry its trunk old and twisted

Ofelia finds herself under a huge FIG TREE that has twisted
into an arch reaching to a nearby crag

OFELIA (VO)
A monstrous toad has settled in its roots
and wont let the tree thrive

Ofelia opens her leather bag Inside there are five large
chestnuts

OFELIA (VO)
You must put the three magic rocks in its
mouth and retrieve a magic key from its
insides Only then will the fig tree
flourish again

The tree roots are partly exposed The tree itself is
surrounded by a large mud puddle

Ofelia decides to take off her fancy silk dress She
carefully hangs everything - including her hair ribbon - on
the tree branches Finally shes down to only a simple
cotton slip and her shoes

As she enters-

The wind picks up and moves her hanging dress Then a
sudden gust sends the hair ribbon flying

INT GALLERY UNDER FIG TREE ROOTS - DAY

Ofelia crawls slowly the gaps between the roots are narrow
and claustrophobic

A few big black pill bugs are nestled in the mud
Ofelia keeps going

CUT TO

INT CAMPSITE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST - DAY

Vidal and his men probe a forest cave Inside they find the
remains of a campfire Vidal removes a glove and touches the
embers

VIDAL
Less than twenty minutes they left in a
hurry

He finds the remains of food and drink

VIDAL
A dozen men at most

In the dirt he discovers the remains of the package the
doctor gave to Mercedes

Inside he finds empty antibiotics containers

VIDAL
Antibiotics

Garcés comes upon a half-burnt lottery ticket

GARCES
(showing him the lottery ticket)
Shit- They forgot this lottery ticket

Vidal motions for silence
VIDAL
Theyre here Those bastards are here and

they are watching us

He stands in rapt silence The trees sway gently He hefts
the empty package like a trophy

VIDAL
You left this behind And the lottery
ticket Come back and get it This could
be your lucky day -
Silence

Then they mount up and ride off

Invisible under the trees six GUERRILLAS are indeed
watching Among them is PEDRO a tall and serious young man
In a flash they all disappear into the underbrush

CUT TO

INT GALLERY UNDER FIG TREE ROOTS - DAY

Ofelias progress is slow Water oozes from the surrounding
roots and mud

Bugs crawl on her arms

She hears a sudden soggy movement up ahead She takes out
the five chestnuts - which are so large they barely fit in
her hands - and works her way toward the noise

Soon she comes face to face with-

-an immense TOAD as big as a boar His golden eyes blink
his cheeks puff rhythmically in and out

OFELIA
Hi-

The Toads long tongue flicks out trapping a couple of
beetles and pulling them back into his mouth Their
chitinous shells crunch noisily in its slimy jaws

Ofelia shudders and tries to stand up As she speaks a
large red pill bug clings to her cheek

OFELIA
I am- Im princess Moanna and Im not
afraid of you-

The Toad observes her unmoved

OFELIA
Arent you ashamed Living down here
eating all the pill bugs and getting fat
while the tree dies

FWAPPPP The Toad sends out its soft pink tongue which
flattens against her face then slides off taking the pill
bug and leaving a gelatinous goo
Three of the chestnuts roll to the ground Ofelia spits in
disgust

The Toad hunkers down shaking violently as it croaks

Ofelia backpedals frightened The Toad resumes its resting
position

Ofelia scoops up the chestnuts Two fall back into the mud
She kneels to get them and-

-deftly palms a juicy fat pill bug It curls itself into a
tight ball She keeps it in the same hand as the chestnuts

The Toad croaks again shoots out its tongue which wraps
around her wrist She stays calm When the tongue retracts
covering her hand with viscous spittle the pill bug is

gone

And so are the chestnuts

The Toad croaks violently and suddenly burps up a gigantic
pearly bubble which floats in the air bathed in blood and

saliva

And with this the Toad shrivels away like a serpent
shedding its skin

Ofelia picks up the warty empty skin and looks at the
bubble

In its center a GOLD KEY

Ofelia plunges her hands into the bubble to grab it

EXT EDGE OF THE FOREST - TWILIGHT

Ofelia emerges from under the tree with the golden key in
hand Shes filthy sweaty and exhausted

She nears the place where she left her dress-

-but its not there
After a brief search she finds her hair ribbon Covered in
mud

A few meters away the dress- covered in wet mossy mud
It starts to rain

Carmen is stony-faced in her distraction

MAYOR

PRIEST
If people are careful it should be

He eats more potatoes

VIDAL
What we cant allow is for anyone to send
food to the guerillas in the mountains
Theyre losing ground - and one of them
is wounded

DOCTOR

sure

VIDAL

Vidal pulls out one of the antibiotic vials

VIDAL

Mercedes briefly catches the Doctors eye

PRIEST
God has already saved their souls What
happens to their bodies well it hardly
matters to Him

MAYOR
We’ll help you in any way we can
Captain

We know you’re not here by choice-
Vidal pauses and locks eyes with him

VIDAL
Youre wrong about that

The guests grow silent

VIDAL
I choose to be here because I want my son
to be born in a clean new Spain

Because these people have the idea that
were all alike But theres a big
difference The war is over and we won

And if we need to kill each of those
motherfuckers to agree on it then well
kill them all And that’s that

He raises his glass and toasts

VIDAL
Were all here by choice

All the guests raise their glasses

She pauses next to a large wood pile and sadly gazes at the

make the Captain’s uniforms-

MAYORS WIFE
I see-

CARMEN
-and after he died I went to work at the
shop A little more than a year ago the

Vidal moves his hand away from Carmens

MAYORS WIFE
Curious isnt it Finding each other
after such a long time

DOCTORS WIFE
Curious indeed- very curious

VIDAL
Please forgive my wife She hasnt been
exposed to the world She thinks these
silly stories are interesting to others

Carmen grows silent Ashamed

Mercedes discreetly comes over to Carmen and speaks to her
Carmen pushes back from the table

CARMEN
Please excuse me

All the men get up as Carmen leaves the dining room The
Guardia Civil Capitan smiles at Vidal

CAPITAN
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father Captain

Vidal cant suppress a brief grimace

VIDAL
No- I had no idea

CAPITAN
In Morocco I met him only briefly but
he left a great impression

Vidal chews his food nervously

VIDAL
An excellent soldier

CAPITAN
The men in his battalion said that when
General Vidal died on the battlefield he
smashed his watch on a rock so that his
son would know the exact hour and minute
of his death

So he would know how a brave man dies
All eyes turn to Vidal

CAPITAN
Nonsense He didnt own a watch

INT UPPER BEDROOM BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Ofelia is floating on the warm water of the tub

CARMEN
What youve done hurts me When you get

Ofelia listens in silence holding back
CARMEN
Are you listening Sometimes I think

youll never learn to behave

Youve disappointed me and your father
too
OFELIA
The Captain

CARMEN
Yes- Him more than me

The faintest trace of satisfaction is visible on Ofelias
face Carmen leaves

greets it

From out of the shadows comes the Faun The Green Fairy
hurries to him

OFELIA
And the baby

The Faun comes near Ofelia chewing a chunk of raw meat

FAUN
I see that you got the key-

The Green Fairy lands on his shoulder He feeds her some meat
FAUN

Shes very glad you succeeded Shes
believed in you from the very start

Out of nowhere he produces a piece of white chalk

FAUN
a piece of chalk-

Ofelia takes the chalk

FAUN
There are still two tasks left and the
moon is almost full Be patient

He caresses her face with his dirty hands which are covered
with creeping bugs

FAUN
Well soon be strolling through the seven
circular gardens of your palace

OFELIA
How do I know that what you say is true

As he comes closer the Fauns face again comes into the
light A wicked grin is revealed-

piece and starts reciting the printed legend

Ofelia looks at a beam of sunlight coming in from the small
bathroom window She reaches out her hand and plays with it

She looks down at a page in the book A small red stain has
appeared Blood

It spreads rapidly until it covers the whole page

INT ATTIC - SUNRISE

Ofelia takes the book out from under her bed Opening it
she sees herself illustrated in a room with a lavish table
full of food In the wall are three niches And at the far
end of the table a pale human figure

OFELIA (VO)
Use the chalk to trace a door anywhere in
your room Open it and start the
hourglass - let yourself be guided by the
Fairies-

Ofelia draws the outline of a door on the wall and then
opens it onto a long hallway Ofelia goes through wearing

INT HALLWAY LEADING TO DINING HALL - SUNRISE

The girl walks down a corridor with a low ceiling and a
multitude of arches Each column represents a tree with
fanning branches An elaborate mosaic pattern spreads over
the floor the ceiling fresco depicts the lunar cycle
INT BANQUET HALL - SAME

In the next room a large wooden table overflows with a
cornucopia of cakes meat fish liquor exotic fruits

Light and warmth pour forth from a roaring fireplace

A PALE MAN with a gaunt featureless face and skeletal body
sits silently at the far end of the table

Hes ominously still his head hanging at an odd angle In
front of him a small metallic plate displays two human

eyeballs

Its very hot beads of sweat roll down Ofelias face Her
hungry stomach growls

She spots the three niches

She takes out her golden key and considers the doors Each
one clad in smooth gold with identical locks

The wicker basket starts to shake furiously Ofelia opens
it The Fairies fly out

They buzz around the three niches like flies around honey
They fan their wings repeatedly vibrating communicating

sniffing the gold doors

Stepping back to let the Fairies investigate Ofelia knocks
over a platter of green grapes

She picks them up and puts them back on the table One of
the grapes remains on the floor

The Green Fairy stops in front of the door in the middle
announcing its decision

Ofelia goes to the door and puts the key in the lock

OFELIA
No- Its this one-

-she goes to the adjoining door sticks the key in the lock
and turns it CLACK

She opens the door and reaches through the doorway to take
whatever is there

Her hand nears a package about 16 centimeters long wrapped
in a dirty rag

Ofelia looks around nothing has happened All is calm The
Pale Man is immobile

Ofelia readies to exit but then she spots a plate full of
ripe grapes so many of them

She looks back at the eerie sitting figure immobile and
seemingly lifeless The Fairies warn her repeatedly trying
to prevent her from eating any grapes But the girl sneakily
picks one up and eats it

Unseen by her- The Pale Man lifts his head and grabs the two
human eyeballs from the metallic plate in front of him

He introduces the eyeballs into twin stigmatas in his palms
and uses his hands to look around splaying his fingers like
excited peacock feathers as he discovers-

-Ofelia eating yet another grape

The Pale Man jerks toward her in spastic disembodied
steps He crouches like an animal ready to pounce

Ofelia turns just in time The Pale Man roars The Fairies
fly at him and attack

Flailing his arms the monster turns over the table dumping
all the food Swatting and snapping he eats two of the
Fairies They HOWL as he bites down

Ofelia runs carrying the precious package The Green Fairy
follows her

The Pale Man comes after her

INT LONG HALLWAY
Ofelia gets to the end of the hallway She pounds the blank
wall where moments ago there was a door

INT ATTIC

Ofelias thumping is barely audible

INT HALLWAY LEADING TO DINING HALL
Ofelia sees the Pale Mans silhouette coming up the hallway

Ofelia searches her pockets for the chalk Finding it she
stands on tiptoe and traces the outline of a door

Ofelia pushes against it and opens-

INT ATTIC - SUNRISE

A trapdoor in the attic floor

INT HALLWAY LEADING TO DINING HALL
Ofelia crawls out the new exit Her legs dangle briefly
The pale monster leaps at them snarling Ofelia pulls

herself up and out just in time The Green Fairy follows shortly
thereafter

INT ATTIC - SUNRISE

Ofelia slams the door behind her The marks on the floor
disappear and it seals itself shut

All the while something directly below bumps violently
almost bursting through the floor
When all is calm Ofelia sits on the bed exhausted The
Green Fairy flutters and chirps excitedly

LATER - RIVER BED

The Doctor washes his bloody hands and his surgical
instruments in the stream that runs through the mountains

DOCTOR
Youre screwed no guns no roof over
your heads You need food medicine
You should take care of Mercedes If you
really loved her you would cross the
border with her This is a lost cause

PEDRO

choice

He moves away towards Mercedes who awaits him nearby She
hands him a copy of the warehouse KEY

MERCEDES
Here’s the key- but you cant come down

He kisses her on the cheek

PEDRO
Leave it to me

MERCEDES

PEDRO

profusely She caresses her face

There is a breakfast tray on the night stand
Ofelia empties a glass of milk into a bowl and pulls the
mandrake root out from under her clothing She submerges it

in the milk then slides the bow under the bed

She bites her finger until a small drop of blood appears It
falls into the milk

The mandrake twitches sucking avidly at the pink liquid

The root uncoils into the floor spiralling around the legs
of the bed-frame

Ofelia hears FOOTSTEPS somebodys coming into the bedroom
Ofelia stays down she can see a pair of shoes

It is the Doctor He checks Carmens pulse and temperature

DOCTOR

Vidal paces nervously nearby-

DOCTOR
Her temperature is down

VIDAL
But she still has a fever

DOCTOR
Yes but its a good sign- her body is
responding

Vidal stares at the Doctor not a trace of emotion in his
eyes

DOCTOR
Listen to me If you have to choose save
the baby That boy will bear my name and
my fathers name too

Ofelia hears this from beneath the bed

Suddenly an explosion shakes the room Vidal looks outside
then another explosion rattles the windows

Bits of plaster drop down from the ceiling onto the ground
near Ofelia

Cursing Vidal rushes from the bedroom The Doctor follows

Vidal inspects a couple of charred BODIES by the wreckage

ENGINEER
I sounded the whistle- but they wouldnt
move I tried to stop but it was too
late-

The long freight train has derailed in the middle of
nowhere Dozens of GUARDIAS CIVIL patrol the disaster

The engineer and the FIREMAN walk among the burned freight
cars with Vidal and his men Some GUARDIAS CIVIL ride up and
dismount

VIDAL
What did they steal from inside the
freight cars

FIREMAN
Nothing They didnt open a single one

VIDAL
What the hell are you talking about

FIREMAN
This whole mess- and they didnt open any
of the cars They didnt take anything

boulders blasting away A guard falls down dead at Vidals
feet three bullets in his chest

Vidal Serrano and Garcés take cover behind a craggy
outcropping Bullets explode onto the stone

Excited Vidal glances at his Fathers watch and smiles

VIDAL
C’mon Serrano this is the only decent
way to die

He leaps out firing Two bullets whiz by his head and bury
themselves in a tree

Vidal keeps shooting wounding two of the guerrillas Garcés
follows also firing

Vidal and Garcés get to-

-the boulders kneeling there is a YOUNG GUERRILLA panting
torn to pieces by the gunfire

VIDAL
Let me see- Can you talk

The Young Guerrilla gasps for air a gaping wound on his
neck bleeds profusely

VIDAL
Pity

He empties his pistol into the Young Guerrilla Garcés is
appalled Vidal reloads and finishes off the second one with
a shot to the temple

VIDAL
(to Serrano)
This is useless- we need one alive- Just

Yes thank you But things havent turned
out so well

FAUN
No

She gives him the package The Faun opens it inside there
is a long gold dagger Its beautiful The blade is

engraved with Celtic lettering and on the handle is the
figure of a satyr hugging a girl who holds a baby

OFELIA
No I had an accident

FAUN
An accident

She hands him the Fairy basket Out of it comes the damaged
Green Fairy who immediately perches atop his shoulder and
starts chattering and pointing at the girl

FAUN
You broke the rules

OFELIA
It was just two grapes I thought no one
would notice-

FAUN
We made a mistake

OFELIA
A mistake

FAUN
You failed You can never go back

The moon will be full in three days
Your spirit will stay forever among
humans

Youll live among them youll get old
like them youll die like them-- and
your memory of us will fade

And well vanish along with it

The Faun backs into the darkest corner of the attic

FAUN
You will never ever see us again

A flash of lightning briefly illuminates the corner The
Faun is gone

arrives with the Doctor

VIDAL
Good day Doctor Sorry to wake you so
early but I think we need some help

The Doctor goes inside

INT BODEGA - MILL - SUNRISE

The Doctor comes into the bodega Vidal stays at the door
Stutter is curled up on the ground His nose is flattened
one eye is bloodshot and a head wound is bleeding Flies

buzz around him

DOCTOR
My God what have you done to him

VIDAL
Not much But things are getting better

Vidal surreptitiously removes a vial of antibiotics from the
Doctors medical bag He wraps it in a linen handkerchief

VIDAL
I like having you near Doctor It has
its advantages

He moves away along with Garcés

VIDAL
Serrano stay here-

Once alone the Doctor opens up his bag and takes out some
alcohol and gauze to clean the wounds

STUTTER
I spoke Not much- b-b-but I did-

The Doctor sees the mans hand its a mess of broken bones
and lacerations

DOCTOR
Im sorry-

He glances at Serrano outside smoking a cigarette

STUTTER
No Kill me kill me now

The Doctor looks him in the eye unsurprised

INT VIDALS STUDY - DAWN

Vidal brings out the packet of medicine from the cave He
takes out a vial of antibiotics and compares it with the one
from the Doctors bag

They are identical

VIDAL
Son of a bitch-
INT BODEGA - SUNRISE
The Doctor prepares an injection

Stutter gratefully squeezes his hand After a brief
hesitation the Doctor administers the injection

The men stare at one another Slowly the life ebbs from
Stutters eyes

INT MILL VESTIBULE - SAME

Vidal briskly leaves his study Hearing a door click shut

There she finds the mandrake root bloated and immobile

He rips it off the milk plate
OFELIA
No Nooo

Vidal is about to hit the girl when-

CARMEN
Please leave her be

Vidal turns Carmen has awakened She motions for him to
stop

VIDAL
Look what she hid under your bed
What do you think of this

He hands Carmen the mandrake root Ashen-faced and weak
Carmen looks at the disgusting thing trying to make sense
of it

CARMEN
Ofelia what is this doing under the bed

OFELIA
(matter of fact)
Its a magic root the Faun gave me

VIDAL
This is all because of that junk you let
her read Look what youve done-

CARMEN

Darling

VIDAL
As you wish

Vidal furious leaves the room

OFELIA
The Faun told me you would get better -
and you did

CARMEN
You have to listen to your father You
have to stop all this
Ofelia hugs her mother with all her might

OFELIA
No- I want to leave this place Please
lets just go -

CARMEN
Things are not that simple

Carmen pries her off and looks her in the eye

CARMEN
As you get older youll see that life
isnt like your fairy tales The world is
a cruel place

She moves away and near the open chimney The firelight
cast shadows over her sweaty face

CARMEN
And youll learn that even if it hurts

She throws the root into the fire

OFELIA
Noooo

CARMEN
Ofelia Magic does not exist

She grabs the girl by the shoulders shaking her

CARMEN
Not for you me or anyone else

Then- a horrible inhuman squeal The dying shriek of the
mandrake Ofelia watches in horror as the humanoid root
writhes and squeals in the chimney flames

Carmen gasps and doubles over in pain clutching her
stomach Ofelia holds her as best as she can

OFELIA
Help help help
INT BODEGA - SAME
The Ddoctor and Vidal study each other

VIDAL
Why did you do it

DOCTOR
It was the only thing I could do

VIDAL
No You could have obeyed me

DOCTOR
I could have But I did not

From somewhere in the house someone CRIES OUT They hear a
commotion among the servants The Doctor stands up and
collects his bag

VIDAL
But it would have been better for you-

Vidal grips his arm stopping him
VIDAL
I dont understand- Why didnt you obey

me

A long beat The Doctor knows that his response will seal
his fate

DOCTOR
To obey without thinking- just like that-

Well- thats something only people like
you can do- Captain-

Vidal takes out his gun and shoots the Doctor who drops to
the ground Vidal stands over him and finishes him off

A stunned Garcés looks on It begins to rain Jacinta and
Conchita approach Vidal- an urgent murmur
VIDAL
Garcés Have the troop paramedic come to
my wifes room right away

knife in her apron

VIDAL
At first I wont be able to trust-

Suddenly- WHACK
Vidal’s body shudders-

-he puts his hand to his left shoulder blade He looks at
his bloody fingers He turns around and stumbles

Mercedes holds the knife Vidal reaches for his gun
Mercedes stabs him again this time deep in his upper arm
As Vidal doubles over in pain she sticks the knife in his
mouth

MERCEDES
At first I wont be able to trust-
Im not some old man - Not a wounded
prisoner- Sonofabitch- sonofabitch-
Don’t you dare touch the girl You wont
be the first pig Ive gutted -

With a brutal thrust - from the inside out - she slices open
his cheek Vidal collapses gurgling blood Mercedes uses
the knife to cut the ropes as quick as she can

Once free Mercedes runs toward the door

spots her at the last minute

She gets to a clearing Closing in Garcés dismounts Six

other riders surround her Mercedes flashes her knife The
horsemen tighten the circle around her
GARCES
Itll be better if you come without
struggling The Captain-

She puts the blade to her own throat
GARCES
Dont be foolish sweetheart if anyone
is going to kill you-

He takes out his gun

GARCES
Itll be me-

He walks up to her Suddenly a gunshot hits him in the
chest and then another and another He falls to the ground
dead

A series of gunshots pick off the other horsemen

The last three soldiers try to escape One is killed by a
furious hail of bullets Serrano and another one manage to

Vidal sews his split cheek and then wraps a blood-stained
bandage around it

Ofelia steals in past the Captains desk
In the cradle the baby starts crying

The babys wails grow louder The Captain turns around
Ofelia hides but leaves her magic chalk behind

Vidal goes to a small table and serves himself the last of
the Orujo Hes takes a sip The bandage soaks up in blood
and alcohol He grunts-

-and pours himself another one

Hes about to take a sip when he sees the chalk on his desk
He instinctively readies his gun Then-

Captain- Captain- Please come quickly-

VIDAL

SERGEANT
None of the watch posts are responding

VIDAL

How many men here in camp

SERRANO
Twenty maybe less sir-

Vidal does the math

INT VIDALS STUDY - NIGHT
Ofelia lifts her brother from the cradle

OFELIA

Nothing is going to happen to you

She wraps him in a blanket and tries to soothe him Halfway
to the door she hears footsteps and hides in a nook

VIDAL
Put the remaining men on picket duty at
the tree line- when another squad gets
back have it report immediately to me

Vidal comes back in followed by the Sergeant

VIDAL
Call for reinforcements

SERGEANT
Yes sir
The Sergeant leaves Vidal goes to his drink But he stops
to pick up his gold and silver watch he winds it and slips
it into his pocket

Finally he drinks his Orujo
In the shadows Ofelia takes a few steps towards the door

Outside the sound of SHOUTING and GUNFIRE An explosion
illuminates the room revealing Ofelia and the baby to
Vidal

Vidal takes out his gun and takes a few faltering steps

VIDAL
Put him down-

The girl edges toward the study door Vidal stumbles toward
her Outside a terrible explosion shatters the window and

shakes the whole house

Im warning you- put him down-

He trips on his desk barely staying on his feet Ofelia

runs away Vidal tries to shake himself awake and goes after
her

The girl runs toward the kitchen Another explosion lights

up the room allowing Vidal to see her He heads straight at
her

EXT BEHIND THE MILL - NIGHT

Ofelia runs outside holding her brother She looks up The

The sleeping medicine makes him stumble and falter He
slumps against a wall Ofelia gains on him

But right away she loses her way but the leafy walls move
aside to guide her-

-first one then another-
-and yet another

Vidal meanwhile bumps into obstacles at every turn Head
spinning he pauses

INT ROTUNDA IN CENTER OF LABYRINTH - NIGHT
Reaching the rotunda Ofelia sees the Faun waiting halfway
up the stone staircase

Ofelia calms the baby and starts down the stairs toward him

FAUN
Quickly Your Majesty give him to me
The full moon is almost here and we need
him to open the portal

OFELIA
(seeing something)
Whats that in your hand

Its the golden dagger

FAUN
The portal will only open if we shed the
blood of an innocent A pin prick- Thats
all Just a drop of blood-

Its the last task Hurry

The basket shakes furiously The Green Fairy escapes and
buzzes furiously around Ofelia

FAUN
You promised to do it so give me the
boy I want to leave this place I cant
wait any longer

The Faun comes closer to the girl His face radiates a
wicked hunger She steps back horrified

OFELIA
No My brother stays with me

FAUN
You would give up your sacred rights for
this brat

OFELIA
Yes I would

FAUN
You will give up your throne for him He
who has caused you such misery such
humiliation

Vidal comes into the rotunda He sees Ofelia alone He
cant see the Faun With enormous effort Vidal lifts his
gun

OFELIA
I will

FAUN
As you wish- Your Highness-

As he recedes into the darkness Vidal shoots The bullet
hits Ofelia in the stomach She falls gently to the ground
at the edge of the well clutching her baby brother

With a loud bang- gunshots tear into Vidal Vidal falls to
his knees hoisting his howling son in the air

VIDAL
My son-
Mercedes walks forward Vidal and Mercedes look at each
other

VIDAL
Tell him about his father- About the time
his father died-

Mercedes takes the baby in her arms

Vidal understands the situation He takes out his pocket
watch and smashes it on the ground

VIDAL
Tell him-

MERCEDES
No-

Pedro steps over to Vidal gun in his hand
MERCEDES
(to Vidal)

He won’t even know your name

Mercedes’ words are Vidals last and most painful wound His
face goes pale-

- and Pedro shoots him in the head

Vidal collapses dead

INT ROTUNDA IN CENTER OF LABYRINTH

Mercedes and Pedro reach the rotunda Mercedes kneels next
to the dying girl Crying Mercedes hums a sweet Galician
lullaby

Ofelias pupils dilate

Her blood runs down into the well into the puddle at the
bottom The moons reflection shimmers

In the book an image takes shape Ofelia at a royal court
in front of a fabulous banquet

KINGFATHER (OS)
Arise my daughter

INT VAST HALL - NIGHT
Ofelia stands The labyrinth has disappeared

This is an immense hall in a dark sumptuous castle A
swarm of fairies floats around her head Before her on a
golden throne sits the KING OF THE UNDERWORLD

At his side an almost unrecognizable Carmen - radiant and
gilded she has transformed into a FAIRY QUEEN Between
them there is another throne empty waiting

Ofelia looks at the King-

OFELIA
(a whisper)
Father

KING
It was your blood and not that of an
innocent that made you worthy of the
throne It was the last task The most
important one

And out from behind a pillar comes out the Faun Smiling
surrounded by the Fairies

FAUN
And you chose well Your Highness

He bows down
QUEEN
So come sit by your Father’s side my

child He’s been waiting so long

The Green Fairy flies around Ofelia celebrating her return
Ofelia is cheered by a hundred voices
Ofelia smiles-

INT LABYRINTH - NIGHT

- and finally dies In her eye one frozen tear Mercedes
hugs the dead girl

CAMERA dollies back The moon is reflected at the bottom of
the pool Buzzing in the night air is the Stick Insect

And it is said that the Princess went
back to her fathers kingdom-

And that she reigned with justice and a

kind heart for many centuries And that
she was loved by all her subjects

EXT EDGE OF FOREST - SUNRISE

The sunlight emanates gradually from the darkness and shines
on the silhouette of the fallen fig tree

And like most of us she left behind

small traces of her time on earth

Visible only to those that know where to
look

The fig tree is flowering again
