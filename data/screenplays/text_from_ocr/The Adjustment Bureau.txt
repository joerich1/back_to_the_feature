EXT ROOFTOP NEAR WALDORF -- NIGHT

A light snow falls Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS
overcoats and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story
building Their clothing is more timeless than old-
fashioned And somehow so is their demeanor

The men get to the edge and look down over the city almost-
as if its their domain

21209 5
INT WALDORF HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
David watches the election coverage on TV Pundits are

discussing the New York Senate race which CNN has already
called for Davids opponent
PUNDIT 1
Congressman Norris has a reputation
for being very direct even blunt
in his campaign speeches which is
great until you say too many things
you wish you hadnt Then you
start to look like an amateur

PUNDIT 2

Thats bad for any candidate but

its fatal if youre running for

Senate at the age of 33 your

opponent keeps calling you an

impulsive kid and you almost

killed your entire political career

five months ago with an act of

immaturity that ended up on the

front page ofthe New York Post

David winces slightly This is excruciating Just then
Charlie enters The nerve centersuite is visible through
the open door behind him

-CHARLIE
Why are you still watching CNN
They called this way too early
David doesnt share his friends optimism

SENIOR AIDE

Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC

BRIAN WILLIAMS
Turning now to the New York Senate
race NBC is now calling the
election for RogerLynfield After
a shockingly poor showing in both
Suffolk county and in his home
county Kings it now appears that
David Norris will lose this
election badly perhaps by as much
as 10 points

INT MENS ROOM -- NIGHT
David enters the huge ornate mens room and goes to the

of sinks He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his
pocket He twirls them in his hands for a moment

Then tosses them into the trash can He looks at himself in
the mirror fighting to hold himself together

A sound behind him David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one
of the stalls Shes in a stunning ball gown and carrying an
expensive bottle of champagne

WOMAN
Hi I hope I didnt startle you

DAVID
What are you doing in here

WOMAN
Hiding from security

DAVID
Oh What did you do

WOMAN
Crashed a wedding One floor up
DAVID
Its almost midnight Theyjust
caught on now

WOMAN
Ivana Trump finally realized I
wasnt her niece I think after
the fifth glass of champagne my
Czech accent started slipping
spite of Davids state that gets a grin

DAVID
Are you for real

WOMAN
Life is short

DAVID
Hard to argue with that

WOMAN
Youre that guy running for Senate
arent you

DAVID
Im that guy
21209 9

WOMAN

DAVID
No

WOMAN

Too bad The other guys a tool
DAVID

(LAUGHS)
Maybe I should have made that
clearer in my ads
WOMAN
Personally I think mooning your
friends at a college reunion is no
big deal

(BEAT)
And I dont think the Post should
have printed the photo
David just shakes his head He will never ever live that
down and he knows it

WOMAN
At least not full page
He cant help but crack up

WOMAN
Listen Ive done it

DAVID
You werent running for Senate at
the time

WOMAN
Do you still have a chance or is it
over

DAVID

He crushed me
She has beautiful eyes And an exceptional gift for
conveying empathy

WOMAN
You must I dont know what you
must be feeling

DAVID
Winning would feel better But
losing has its advantages

21209 10

WOMAN
Like what
DAVID
The only time a politician is alone
is when hes asleep or in the
bathroom After eight years in
politics that gets kind of hard to
take
She tilts her head a little gives him a curious look

WOMAN

Watching you youd never know it

The way she looks at him the way she says it David knows
she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isnt even
quite sure what it is Not yet

DAVID

Thank you

WOMAN
Well everything happens for a
reason right Even losing God
Im really rollrng out the
platitudes tonight arent I

DAVID
Its the champagne Brines out the
Hallmark in people

WOMAN
After it kills their Czech accents
She offershim the bottle He hesitates then takes it

DAVID
Why not I have to think up some
good platitudes for my speech
He takes a gulp of champagne

WOMAN
Why the hell would you do that

DAVID
Apparently even if I hadnt been
caught dropping my drawers in the
middle of a senate campaign I would
have lost the election anyway
because Im too blunt

WOMAN
(swig of champagne)
Says who
21209 11

DAVID
The TV pundits

WOMAN
Fuck em They just wish they had
the balls to be candidates
themselves
She hands him the champagne bottle again

WOMAN
And they work for the Man anyway

(BEAT)
You going to run again

DAVID

(DRINKS)
Tonights probably not the night to
ask

WOMAN

(FINGER POINTING)
No it is Look at me You have
to run again Do-yo hear me
Shes serious about this Intense

WOMAN
Otherwise the-country will be run
by tools like Lynwood

DAVID
Field

Lynfield
A beat She shrugs
Then they lean toward each other and kiss It turns more
and more passionate When they finally pull apart

DAVID
Holy shit
She seems just as surprised They look at each other and
laugh
Just then the bathroom door opens Its Charlie He sees

INT GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

David as he walks out from behind a
His supporters start clapping
heartbroken David looks completely

DAVID
I grew up in Red Hook and I dont
want to shock anybody but I got in
a few fist fights along the way
Laughter ripples through the crowd
to get the joke

21209 13

DAVID
And we used to have a saying when
you got in a fight its not
whether or not you get knocked down
-- because eventually everyone does
-- its what you do when you get
back up

(BEAT)
Dont worry Im not going to moon
you
The audience explodes with laughter

DAVID
But I am

to die down)
But I am going to get backup I

deal you the cards you want

curtain onto the dais

peaceful

We dont know enough yet

this time
The audience sobered now Reflective

DAVID
My life changed when I was ten
years old My entire world turned
upside-down
His audience knows exactly what hes talking about

DAVID
And as I looked for something to
-hang on to something to help me
cope with what had happened the
only thing that made sense to me
was service Finding a way to do
something with my life that left
this world a little better than I
found it
The audience is moved Tears begin to well up People dab

You cant get away David
David spins and rushes back into the main office then down
an internal staircase to the floor below Jumps the last
five steps and hits the floor hard
As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who

frozen solid

David curses then dives around the frozen employee to find
Richardson coming out of another office down the hall
Again physically impossible for him to get there that fast-
David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a

chloroform rag shoved right at us FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT

FROM DAVIDS POV BLURRY FOCUS as hes carried toward one of

the large corner offices on the 40th floor

The nameplate reads Steve Kincaid

Richardson opens the door and ushers his men carrying
David

INSIDE --

Except when they walk through the door theyre not in an
office 40 floors above lower Manhattan they step inside a
large warehouse

Their movement completely violates the laws of physics

BLACK SCREEN
Silence Then voices come up slowly

RICHARDSON (0S)

Yes sir No sir No sir I
understand that sir Absolutely
Ill do that sir

(BEAT)
What a goddamm mess

MCCRADY (0S)
Was that Donaldson

RICHARDSON (0S)
Yes

MCCRADY (0S)
What do you want to do

21209 28
FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVIDS POV of the
warehouse
David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out
A half-dozen members of the Intervention Team (the Silver
Suits) stand nearby Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men
from the rooftops) stand behind David about 20 feet away

RICHARDSON (0S)
Can you reset him
to

MCCRADY (0S)
I dont think we have the authority
in a situation like this

RICHARDSON (0S)
CALL LEGAL-

BURDENSKY (0S)
Legal just arrived

INT WAREHOUSE -- DAY

REVEAL BURDENSKY a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit
carrying a briefcase Hewalks to Richardson

BURDENSKY
Re-settings off the table This
is our fault
Richardson glances irately at Harry who stands by himself
off to the side clearly disgraced
David who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson
cranes around to see whos talking

DAVID
Hey
The suits stare back in silence for a beat then turn back

talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume

RICHARDSON
What are my options

BURDENSKY

(IGNORING DAVID)
You could bullshit him but youll
never be completely successful

DAVID
Can somebody tell me whats going
on
21209 29

BURDENSKY
(still ignoring him)
The questions will burn in him till
the day he dies Youll have to
monitor him constantly

ON DAVID
He can hear little snippets of what Burdenskys saying--

BURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE)

-to make sure he doesnt talk

the endless ripple effects

REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him

ON THE SUITS

BURDENSKY
If it were me Id level with him

RIC HARDSON
Completely

BURDENSKY
Thats the only way to extinguish
his curiosity
Richardson turns and studies David Then walks over to him
An uncomfortable pause

DAVID
Who are you guys

RICHARDSON
Were the people v ho make sure
things happen according to Plan
David stares back at him for a moment
then leaps up His rope comes off and the chair falls He
sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse
Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--

CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR
It cracks and displaces upward so its uneven just as
Davids foot comes down on it
21209 30

BACK TO WIDE SHOT
David trips and goes flying--

MOMENTS LATER
David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed
back in his chair in front of Richardson

RICHARDSON
Did you really think I couldnt see
that coming
David dabs blood from his lip which split during the fall

RICHARDSON (CONTD)
I can read your mind
David stares back

RICHARDSON (CONTD)
Yeah really

(BEAT)
Choose a color
(barely a beat)
Blue Choose a number
(even less time)
Seventeen
Davids jaw drops slightly Richardson was clearly right

RICHARDSON
Now why are you still deciding
whether or not to run
Davids hands go to his head involuntarily an atavistic
response as ifsomehow that will keep his thoughts from
spilling out into view

RICHARDSON
You saw the futility of that back
at the office
Davids entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
point He cant hang on any longer to an explanation for all
this based in the world hes known to date

DAVID
What the hell is happening to me
21209 31

RICHARDSON
You just saw behind a curtain you
werent even supposed to know was
there Mr Norris Its jarring
Im sure

DAVID
I just came to work

RICHARDSON
It wasnt your fault Your Path
through the world this morning was
supposed to be adjusted
(glancing bitterly at
Harry in the corner)
Your coffee was supposed tospill
onto your shirt as you left
Starbucks near your apartment
You would have gone up to change
and arrived at work ten minutes
later than you did By then we
would have left

(BEAT)

People call it chance when their

coffee spills or their internet

goes down or they misplace their

eys Sometimes it is Sometimes

itsusnudging you back on Plan

David takes all this in Hes still shell-shocked

DAVID
Whatever you were doing to Charlie
back there it wasnt misplacing
his keys

RICHARDSON

Sometimes when nudging a person
back on Plan isnt enough we
intervene directly

DAVID
Why Charlie What did you do to
him

RICHARDSON

You need to worry about getting
back on your Plan David not worry
about us putting him back on his
David stares back still trying to get his bearings

RICHARDSON (CONTD)
Only a handful of human beings know
what you now know David Were
determined to keep it that way

21209 32

RICHARDSON (CONTD)
So before I let you go you need to
understand something If you ever
reveal our existence we will erase
your brain Your memories your
emotions your entire personality
will be expunged Your friends and
family will think youve gone
crazy You wont think anything
because a blank slate cant
think
Davidstares back

RICHARDSON
Do you understand what I just said

DAVID
Yes

RICHARDSON
Not a word Not one word about us
(long beat as he studies

DAVIDS FACE)

David stands there a monentnot sure its real
Richardson
points at the door David walks toward it
Just then another man comes up to Richardson

NEW MAN IN SUIT

Two men come through from outside and block Davids exit

DAVID
He said I could go

He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see

21209 33

RICHARDSON
How is that possible Why didnt
we get an alert

NEW MAN IN SUIT

He wasnt supposed to be on that
bus He was supposed to be
changing his shirt in his
apartment It was a controlled
situation It was supposed to be
The new man looks at Harry

AT THE DOOR
David looks back at Richardson

DAVID
You said I could go
Richardson walks over to him

RIC HARDSON
You ran into a woman named Elise on
the bus this morning

DAVID
(going very still)
Why does itmatter

RICHARDSON
You werent ever supposed to see
her again

DAVID
Why do you care

RICHARDSON
Because David you cant be with
her And we didnt want to have to
resort to this--
Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
prison guards incapacitating a prisoner Richardson reaches
into Davids pocket and pulls out his wallet--

DAVID
What the hell-- What are you--
Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her
number on from Davids wallet--

DAVID (CONTD)

No--

21209 34
Richardson places the wallet back in Davids pocket then
pulls out a lighter--

DAVID (CONTD)
No
And burns Elises number David strains and tries to pull
loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team
men But he cant get free

DAVID (CONTD)
What is wrong with you people
Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn
ON Davids reaction CUT TO

EXT PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY

David sits on a bench looking at the water The wind picks
up and he puts his hands in hiscoatpockets to keep them
warm His right hand feels something He pulls out a
ticket for the 4 pm CircleLine tourist boat cruise
EXT CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY

The boat pulls away frontthe dock Its misting rain so
theres only asmattering of tourists on-board David stands
looking back at Manhattan Harry is next to him

HARRY
A lot of people just collapse when
they see what youve seen Their
personal choices suddenly seem
meaningless to them Life starts
to feel pointless

DAVID
I was raised to believe theres
something behind the curtain I
just never pictured it quite like
this

HARRY
Most people dont
Harry looks over his shoulder scans for any signs of his
colleagues Hes far from relaxed

HARRY
How are you feeling

DAVID
You should know You can read my
mind right

21209 38

Harry hesitatesas if hes not sure how much to tell
David

how far to go with this Finally

HARRY
Richardson was just trying to scare
you

DAVID

He knew what color I was thinking

HARRY
Because he set it up as a choice
Choose a color Choose a number

DAVID
So
Harry looks away Hes crossing a line Hes really putting
himself out there

HARRY
We cant read your mind or hear
your thoughts But before you make
a choice your brain weighs options
and we percpite that We know if
youre going to go off Plan or not
because as long as were close
enough we cansense it when its
about to happen

DAVID
it- s like a sixth sense for you

HARRY
Seventh actually

DAVID
What did they do too Charlie

HARRY
Made some small change in the way
he assesses risk

DAVID
What type of risk

HARRY
(this is beside the point)
I dont know Something arcane
Something to do with mortgage-
backed securities

DAVID
Thats all
21209 39
HARRY
Yes
DAVID

What would your colleagues do to

you if they knew what you were

telling me

This is precisely what Harry has been worried about

HARRY
Thats why were meeting out here

DAVID
Theyre not following me

HARRY
We dont have the manpower to
follow everybody all the time
Theyre checking in on you Just
not here Not right now
ON Davids face considering this

EXT UPPER DECK DAY
Moments later They stand out of earshot of the few
tourists up here

DAVID
Why are you helping me

HARRY
I have my reasons
David studies him Harrys clearly not ready to go into

THEM

DAVID
Why do they care if Im with Elise

HARRY
Your entire reality gets shattered
this morning and you want to know
about a woman

DAVID
Why do they care
Harry looks back at him Taken aback a bit by how much David
seems to care

HARRY
I dont know

21209 40

DAVID
You have no idea

HARRY
All I know is given the amount of
resources theyve used keeping you
from her is pretty important to
them
(off Davids silence)
Youre going to look for her arent
you
Again David is silent

HARRY (CONTD)
There are twelve million people in
this city On a slow day Youre
not going to find her you do
realize that dont yore-

(BEAT)
Even if a hypnotist pulled her
number out of the recesses of your
brain no matter how many times you
called it youd never get
through

DAVID
(his face hardening)
They send you here to tell me that

HARRY (CONTD)
You want my advice Forget about
her Accept that you1l never see
her again Move on with your life
ON David as Harrys words sink in

DAVID
No girlfriend
She looks at him with continued skepticism But his
expression is dead serious

DAVID (CONTD)

herself for that but its the truth

ELISE
(re his suit)
Dont you have to get to work

DAVID

Off Richardsons surprised look--

INT MAIN DINING ROOM -- DAY

Davidand Elise eat brunch

ELISE
Ballet is basically impossible to
do correctly

DAVID
Why

ELISE
You just do absurd things with your
body The movement is completely
unnatural It requires incredible
strength in all sorts of random
muscles And you have to be born
with ridiculous amounts of
flexibility in your hip or youll
never be an y good

EXT BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

McCrady examines his Planbook diagram With each new update
of the diagram red inflection points move across the pages
toward a heavy black present time line on the right side

the right page
Richardson points at the red point closest to the present
tithe hrie

RICHARDSON
Whats that
MCCRADY
If they kiss
RICHARDSON
(DISBELIEVING)

A kiss thats all it takes

MCCRADY
A real kiss But once they do that
every possible adjustment thats
strong enough to break them up will
cause ripples over your limit
21209 52

If Melton and Morris do their jobs
right well be okay
But Richardson is clearly worried

INT MAIN DINING ROOM -- DAY

ELISE
In the history of ballet thereve

DAVID
I think Americans are tired of
electing automatons whose every
word and move is stage-managed so
as not to offend anyone I think
they want somebody who doesnt hide
who he is or what he really
believes I guess Im hoping they
want to elect someone whos
actually like them

But I could be very wrong about
that

21209 92

THOMPSON
Who said anything about Free Will
David stares back at him

THOMPSON

You know we actually tried Free
Will before After taking you from
hunting and gathering to the height
of the Roman Empire we stepped back
to see how youd do on your own
You gave us the Dark Ages -- for
five centuries -- until finally we
decided we should come back in

(BEAT)
The Chairman thought maybe we just
needed to do a better job of
teaching you how to ride the bike
before we took the training wheels
off again So we gave you the
Renaissance the Enlightenment the
Scientific Revolutonizg’we spent
six hundred years tempering your
passions with reasonthen in 1910
we stepped ba izgc again Within
fifty yearsizyou brought us World
War I the lepression Fascism the

Holocaust ani capped it off by
bringingtheentire planet to the
brink of destruction in the Cuban
Missile Crisis A decisiOfl was

taken atthat point that we should
stop in again before Atou did

You ont have Free Will David

Will

DAVID
You expect meto believe that
THOMPSON

(BORED SHRUG)
You have Free Will over what tie
you pick in the morning or what
beverage to order at lunch But
humanity just isnt mature enough
to have control over the important
things

DAVID
If youre in control of the
important things then youre
incompetent cause when I look
around at the world these days it
seems pretty fucked

21209 93

THOMPSON
Its still here If wed left
things in your hands it wouldnt
be

DAVID
Why are you trying to keep me from
Elise Or are you just another
lackey who doesnt really know
Thompson studies David for a long beat Then decides its
time to level with him

THOMPSON
We put Elise in front of you three
years ago to inspire you to g ‘ve
that speech -- the speech that
pulled you back from the brink of
oblivion and overnight itiadeyou
the front runner for this coming
election The intervention on
Charlie was to prevent the hedge
fund you had just become vice
chairman of from going belly up in
the sub-primecrisis bringing two
major banks down with it arid in
the process making you unelectable

him He doesnt know any of them-but they sure know him

EXT RED HOOK DOCKS -- NIGHT

David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers
holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag

21209 104

There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off
the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls

A figure in a suit approaches David from behind He turns
to see the man

DAVID
Why are you here
REVERSE to REVEAL Harry in a suit and raincoat

HARRY
I would have come earlier but I had
to wait for the rain
(off Davids confusion)
Water interferes with their ability
to sense your decision tree
Thats why we met on a boat last

time

(BEAT)
I guess Im here to set the record
straight

DAVID

About what
HARRY -
Thompson was lying when he said
they couldnt let you be with 8lise
because it would bring out your
reckless side

DAVID
Why then Why do they care so
much

HARRY
8ecauseshes enough David If

you have her r tau rtt ght not need to

fill the d side you with votes

and ataplauseand dreams of one day

becoming p sident

if Harry haslooked straight into Davids soul

HARRY
Ive watched you a long time
Theyre right to want you in the
White House It would be good for
the world Thats important but it
cant be the only thing that

matters

DAVID
Why are you so different than they
are

21209 105
A long beat then

HARRY
You know your Dad was a smart man
He could have been a lot more --
and he wanted to be So did your
brother But the Plan didnt call
for that
This hits David hard

HARRY
In my job you implement the
Plan

(EMOTIONAL)
And most of the time you dont
even know why
(BEAT)
Im sorry
DAVID
My mom
HARRY
That wasnt me that wasnt us at
all
David takes all this in After along be t he takes a
drink
Then he offers the bottle to Harry who h a esitates then
takes

a drink as well

DAVID
When Thompson told methe choice
as Elise or the White House I
barely hesitated

D1 ID
But the trt t i “is after making that
choice I went into a free-fall
Dont getme wrong it killed me to
see Thompson hurt herbut I used
it as an excuse I think I left
her more to save my career than
hers

(STRUGGLING)
Thompson wasnt lying The press is
already talking about me as a
future president Im phoning in
my speeches and Im still sixteen
points up in the polls

HARRY
The public loves you
21209 106

DAVID
Before I met Elise that was all
that mattered Now I hardly
notice Shes all I think about

(BEAT)
Do you know where shes getting
married

HARRY

is and Ill walk away

HARRY
Thompson wont let you get near

away

DAVID
What if Icould move as fast as you
can

HARRY
What do you mean

DAVID
Teach me about the doors
HARRY
How do you know about that

21209 107

DAVID
The first day after they caught
me they carried me through oneI
thought it was a hallucination at
first Eventually I realized its
how you move around so fast
(off Harrys reluctance)
If you dont want to help me
because of what theyll do to
youokay thats your choice
But if this is about protecting me
then shouldnt the choice be mine

HARRY
Do you have any idea how
complicated it is to navigate
through those doors how many
thousands of permutations there are
in even a simple several block
journey

DAVID
You know when I do town hall
meetings I usually get introduced
to forty or fifty people between
when I walk through the door and
when I start speaking But when
Im done with the speech I can call
on each one of them by ‘game
A beat

HARRY
Ive seen you do that
(taking tl leap )
The rain is supposed to stop in the
nexthour Were going to need all
night to do this And were going
to need aplace surrounded by water
to do it

MOMENTS LATER
Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the
end of the pier Harry dons his hat

HARRY
Put your hand on my shoulder And

in martial arts movies but at the same time something fluid

Harry rolls out a block-by-block map of lower Manhattan
There are intricate red pen markings all over the map

HARRY
Lower Manhattan is a nightmare
Layer upon layer of substrate --
thats what we call the system of
doors -- has been added over time
That makes it a lot more complex to
navigate down here than it is
uptown And a lot slower
Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors interior

there alone

Hello David Good morning
Elise
His voice is gentle paternal

DAVID
Who are you

THE CHAIRMAN
I think you know
David and Elise stand in awe-as they realize

DAVID
You cant otirn Fate
Tf£t CHAIRMAN
Its more- complicated tan that
Fate am Free Will coexist
Theyrein tension with each other
And pure chance
A beat David looks back at him

DAVID

TH2igHAT RMAN

I could control everything Youd
be ha 3 ou d be puppets I

try to keep things from getting too
out of control But that has a
cost Most people go through life
like pinballs reacting predictably
to the stimuli I apply They

accept the path they find
themselves on And perform
accordingly But every once ina
while someone comes along who
refuses to be bound by his fate
someone who understands that Free
Will is a gift most people are too
afraid to use

(BEAT)
Which you see is partly the point
of all this
21209 129

THE CHAIRMAN (contd)
Or maybe you dont see it Maybe
you just feel it And thats even
better Because thats the other
part

David and Elise take it in

DAVID
And all the misery all the pain

THE CHAIRMAN
I sit up there and I watch it and
it hurts me but if you could see
the incredible courage people show
the random acts of kindness the
love If you could see huitan
beings choosing every moment
every day to be better thAn
them you would know its all
worthwhile

I made

(BEAT)
Good luck David And good luck to
you Elise Youre a-beautiful
dancer And so much more
The Chairman turns to his aide who we didnt know was
there

THE CHAIRMAN
Their case isclosed

AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN

But Sirisnt this a majtr

deviation from The Plan

The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper

THE CHAIRMAN
Not anymc3e
David and Elise watci The Chairman walk away still awed by
whattheyve just experienced As He disappears around a
corner the sun comes out from behind the clouds
After a long beat Elise turns back to David as if to say
what do we do now

DAVID
Maybe we should go dancing
A smile slowly spreads across her face

THE END
