LIVES

FADE IN

EXT MEADOW - NIGHT

Moonlight drips off dewy weeds like diamonds

Heavy BREATHING suggests climax

CLOSE ON - a girl’s lips wet with exhaustion Hair in her
eyes sticking to her forehead She wipes strands away with

cracked bloody nails

Blood smears her rouged cheeks Moonlight reflects in her
eyes Blinks Enough time has passed She flips over

She’s 18 with a natural beauty punctuated by fierce
determination The look in her eyes is not yet that of fear
but rather hatred

She focuses on the perimeter of the field where -

The foot tall grass meets a wall of dense forest Nothing
alive in there Nothing moving

She holds steady Staring Counts in nervous rasps
GIRL
One two three four five six
seven eight nine ten

No movement Nothing

GIRL
Come on bitch You can do it

She can’t move Frozen in place when -

A FIGURE a man steps out of the forest into the meadow’s
edge We can’t see his face but she knows

He’s staring right at her

She drops into the grass Eyes flitting at the massive open
night sky above her Too many stars No focus Fuck Fuck
Fuck She RUNS

Wearing only panties and a guinea T she bolts on strong
legs The dew causing the dirt to smear along her thighs like
so much mascara She runs for the far edge of the meadow
where the great lawn meets an intimidating thick of trees

As she closes in on the forest
The Man STEPS from the woods into the meadow The very grass
seems to wither under his weight Faceless cloaked in
shadow he breaks into a steady run

The Girl hits the woods in a full panicked run

EXT WOODS - SAME

Bramble and twigs meet her exposed flesh and tear at her She
ignores the pain Runs on bare feet over decades of
desiccated foliage The sloughing of nature

Trees seem to grope for her Out the corner of her eye she
sees a SILVER BOX

A WIRE glitters
She jumps the wire Runs on

Slides down a ravine kicking away sharp branches reaching
the bottom She looks UP

The Figure approaches the edge

GIRL
FUCK YOU

He begins to slide down the ravine She runs

Beelines straight through a wall of bramble

EXT CREEK - NIGHT

Moonlight ripples through the overhang of leaves onto a slow
creek She doesn’t slow down and splashes through four inches
of water

ON HER BARE FEET - slicing through the creekand then into
the water over the creek bed that’s lined with BROKEN GLASS

She runs missing the shards of glass and then CATCHES ONE
GLASS TEARS INTO THE SIDE OF HER FOOT

The Girl holds her hand to her mouth to stop from screaming
She stops in the middle of the creek and looks around

BROKEN SHARDS OF GLASS surround her Tears explode
Hyperventilating she eases her way to the other side of the
creek
Inspects her foot Rips out a three inch piece of GLASS
Takes off her T-shirt and ties it around the gash Ties it
tight Runs holding the glass tight in her hand

She runs through the woods

EXT CREEK - NIGHT

The FIGURE splashes through the creek Glass means nothing to
his heavy boots

He reaches the far side The woods echo silence He bends

down and dips his fingers in a PUDDLE OF BLOOD Catches the
MOON GLITTER WHITE off a second shimmering puddle

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The Girl can HEAR THE ROAD ahead

Through the trees she can see cars The roar of eighteen
wheelers She pounds over the terrain running for the road
but before she can react to the -

SILVER BOX

She trips a wire and

THREE THICK NYLON CABLES triangulate and catch her at the
knees She’s hauled off her feet SMACKING HER HEAD ON THE
GROUND and then pulled up

-and off the ground Swinging Blood from her head
dripping peppering the forest floor with an all too real
fate

She REACHES OUT GRABS hold of a nearby Alder tree on her

pendulous arc Holds herself there and uses the shard of
glass in her hand to CARVE

EXT WOODS - SAME

The Figure stops dead He directs his attention toward the
East

Slowly methodically he breaks off a HEAVY BRANCH and heads
toward the sound of the road
EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The Girl painstakingly carves her message into the tree the
glass cutting into her palm Blood peppering the forest
floor She finishes and we read her handiwork

EMMA WARD IS ALIVE

EMMA lets go of the tree Swings

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

From the depths of the woods the Figure draws closer

EXT WOODS - SAME
Emma’s POV - The FIGURE enters her periphery

EMMA
Oh please no

Emma holds the SHARD OF GLASS in her hand like a knife As if
it will help

He approaches swinging the HEAVY BRANCH at his side Emma
stabs futilely at the space between them

EMMA
Stay away Stay away Please

He takes a running start and swings the branch at her head -

ALL GOES BLACK

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

Washington State Route 90 The road itself cuts a swath
through a dense sea of forest

A BLACK 7 SERIES BMW pulling a small U-Haul trailer blazes
east

We stay on the car as it travels from the semi-populated
what could be said suburban part of the state to the sparse
off the grid no man’s land

INT BMW - DAY

A dark beauty in a pretty flowered dress stares out the
passenger window at the blur of trees

In her late 20’s BETTY flirts with melancholia She’s lost
something in her life but knows that happiness is within her
grasp

BETTY
I don’t know it’s just not going
to be the same

The DRIVER 38 handsome with piercing eyes an inner
strength to match his muscular prowess smiles at her

DRIVER
Trust me It’ll be the same

BETTY
I’m going to miss everyone

Driver ruminates on that one He’ll miss them as well
DRIVER

It’s life Betty Sometimes it’s
necessary to relocate

BETTY
Don’t make it seem like it’s not
your fault

DRIVER

Out of every bad situation comes
something good Don’t you agree

BETTY
You have a truly demented way of
looking at things

DRIVER
And if I didn’t I don’t think
you’d be so in love with me

BETTY
Don’t flatter yourself Everything
gets warped in definition

DRIVER
We’re splitting hairs here You
know that don’t you

She continues to stare out the window Silence Driver can’t
handle the cold shoulder

DRIVER
Hey why don’t we do a little
sightseeing

(MORE)
DRIVER (CONTD)
I’m sure there’s something to look
at besides all these trees right

EXT GLACIER NATIONAL PARK - DAY
Driver and Betty gaze out from an outcropping at

ACRES OF BURNED FOREST

BETTY
It’s beautiful

DRIVER
Apparently sixteen firefighters
were killed during the blaze
Eleven in a firestorm Five from
smoke inhalation

BETTY

Their ghosts are down there
DRIVER

If you believe that sort of thing
BETTY

Don’t you
DRIVER

No I don’t believe in ghosts

BETTY
No I don’t imagine you would

Driver puts his arm around Betty She lays her head on his
shoulder Together they look at the blackened landscape like
lovers standing on the beach

EXT RURAL ROAD - DAY

The BMW navigates the winding road Up ahead is a small
motel The Highwayman with a vacancy sign

Adjacent to the motel a rotary is under construction

INT MOTEL - OFFICE - DAY
The BELL over the door rings when it opens Driver enters

The owner of the motel HARRIS 50 enters from the back
room
HARRIS
Please don’t say you’re here for
directions I’ve got fifteen rooms
all with your name on it

DRIVER
The good news is I know exactly
where I’m going The bad news is I
only need one room

HARRIS
I’1l take what I can get

Harris clicks the computer off of sleep Sits in front of it

HARRIS
Let me ask you What would you do
if the county tells you they’re
going to tear up half your property
to build a goddamn rotary No one
asks They just tell

DRIVER
I don’t know I guess I’d make
someone pay

HARRIS
Damn straight Stinking
bureaucrats

(beat)
I just need a credit card

As Driver goes for his wallet
HARRIS
You solo Not that it matters All

the rooms have two queens

DRIVER
Travelling with my girlfriend

HARRIS
Is it serious

DRIVER
Serious as a heart attack

HARRIS
That’s what I like to hear

Harris looks over Driver’s shoulder Spots Betty in the car

HARRIS
Pretty Young
DRIVER
Exactly the way I like them

Driver hands over his credit card

HARRIS
Good for you Good for you Me I
been married to the same woman for
thirty two years Since we were
eighteen The only part of her that
works the same is her mouth

DRIVER
Well that might not be such a bad
thing

Beat

HARRIS
Ha I just got that That’s funny
(beat)
But not what I meant
unfortunately

Harris looks at the card

HARRIS
What an unusual name

DRIVER
My father had an unforgiving
commitment to historical reference

HARRIS
Well let’s get you set up here
huh How’s the number eight sound
to you

DRIVER
Infinity I like it

INT MOTEL - ROOM 8 - DAY

It’s the top of the hour Driver lays on the bed watching the
news

Betty comes out of the bathroom fresh from a shower She’s
wrapped up in a towel Her damp hair only makes her sexier
Driver holds up his hand

DRIVER
Here it is again
NEWSCASTER (VO)
Local law enforcement and the
FBI are scouring the area north
of Spokane for any evidence that
can lead them to missing heiress
Emma Ward

A local SHERIFF talks to the media

SHERIFF
(on TV)

From what we can tell the carving
is about six months old It’s
impossible to get an accurate date
but tree growth on that particular
Alder indicates about half a year
Probably done in the spring right
around well after her abduction

Driver turns down the TV Betty looks at him

BETTY
You think they’1l ever find her

DRIVER
Doubtful

BETTY
Doubtful suggests there’s a chance

DRIVER
There’s always a chance But you
know how these things turn out

Driver gets off the bed Turns the TV off He
of Betty She smiles at him

DRIVER
Take off the towel

Betty undoes the towel It drops to the floor
naked vulnerable He drops to his knees Buries his face

into her belly His fingers caressing a TWO INCH SCAR THAT
CREASES HER PELVIS

DRIVER
I’m sorry I’m sorry about
everything

ON THE NEWS - Forensic teams are searching a wooded area
Lots of police tape

CLOSE UP SHOT OF - the carving that reads EMMA WARD IS ALIVE

stands in front

leaving her

BETTY
The man who lacks emotion is sorry
I don’t believe it

DRIVER
I don’t lack emotion I just
process it differently

BETTY
Must everything about you be
different I’d like normal just
for this
(she motions “between the
two of them)
a little normal

DRIVER
I would change it if I could but I
can’t I just can’t

BETTY
What doesn’t kill us makes us
stranger
(beat)

Just tell me you don’t love her
more than me

Betty shuts her eyes Waiting for his answer

DRIVER
I don’t

BETTY
But I need to hear it

DRIVER
I don’t love her more than you I
never did It was justdifferent

Betty pulls him up Face to face She begins to unbutton his
shirt His pants

Clothes fall to the carpet

Their naked bodies meet on the bed Writhing flesh A
symphony of forgiveness met with explosive love making
EXT HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Two MOTORCYCLES a DODGE PICK-UP and a WHITE WORK VAN are
parked outside this quaint off the road vacation home

As we get closer to the house we can HEAR the dull thump of
BASS

INT HOUSE - DAY

The dull bass morphs into SCREAMING DEATH METAL as

A YUPPIE DAD 35ish stumbles out of a bedroom blood
streaming down his face from an open gash across his
forehead

OFF CAMERA - A woman SCREAMS

Yuppie Dad falls to his knees furtive glance behind him
reaches into his pocket and retrieves his cell phone

Hands shaking he tries to dial a number
CLOSE ON - The PHONE fingers punching out91

BAM Shotgun blast and the PHONE AND FOUR FINGERS
disintegrate in a spray of blood and cheap plastic

Yuppie Dad stares where his fingers used to be Sprays spit
as he begs the figure looming behind him

ELLIOT HOAG 38 hardened and unforgiving pumps the gun
Terminator style

Yuppie Dad crawl on his knees and elbows Hoag follows
casually behind him

Yuppie Dad reaches a door Turns the knob with his good
hand

INT HOUSE - KID’S ROOM - DAY

Yuppie Dad crawls to the RACECAR BED in the middle of the
room Leans up against it His helpless plea’s lost under the
pounding music

BAMHoag ends Yuppie Dad right there

Hoag just stands there Savoring the silence And then from
the other room another GUN SHOT

Beat

Hoag turns to face

FLYNN a sinister looking lowlife around 28 stands in the
doorway Dirtbag good looks punctuated by soulless eyes 357
Magnum hanging in his hand Flynn assesses the room

Flynn walks to the closet Opens it to find

A TEN YEAR OLD BOY is huddled in fear in the corner of the
closet

INT HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY

TWO MEN and a WOMAN are packing up the living room They are
single minded like movers on a job Constructing boxes
Carefully wrapping the finer things Labeling Sealing them
up An efficient machine

A THIRD GUNSHOT shatters the upstairs

The woman TAMARA 28 and sizzling hot and with the moral
center of a concentration camp guard flits her eyes upward

Hoag and Flynn enter the living room

ALBERT 26 a loyal acolyte of Hoag’s grabs the box and
heads to the door

DENNY 19 with the spine of an oyster dutifully follows
Albert opens the front door where

A GIANT A HULKING FIGURE 6’8” maybe 450 pounds stands
there Dumb obedience Albert shoves the box in his hands

The Giant takes the box and loads it into

EXT HOUSE - DAY

The WORK VAN He slides the box in with a couple dozen more
just like it All neatly labeled and inventoried

Suddenly the music stops and the silence is slowly replaced
by the delicate sounds of nature Hoag and the crew silently
exit the house

EXT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

The Van is pulling out Hoag driving Tamara next to him
Behind them Albert drives the Pick-Up and the Giant rides
shotgun

The bikes roll up to Hoag’s side Hoag rolls down the window
Flynn flips his visor up

HOAG
Flynn clear the path with Denny
Angel’s coming in tomorrow so that
should give us plenty of time to
unload

FLYNN
Done

He flips his visor and both bikes scream out of the driveway
The Van and Pick-Up pull slowly after them
INT MOTEL - ROOM 8 - DUSK

Betty sleeps soundly Suddenly her eyes snap open The CREAK
AND CLICK of the room door opening

She slowly rolls over as
Driver enters She looks at him A sadness in her eyes

DRIVER
I had to

BETTY
Dont

Beat

DRIVER
I’m hungry

BETTY
So go eat

DRIVER
And leave you here alone Right

BETTY
Why don’t you just go to dinner
with your girlfriend

DRIVER
Would you be rational

BETTY
How dare you ask me that I know
what you were doing out there

DRIVER
You’re wrong

Beat

BETTY
Fine

INT BMW - DUSK

Harris stands outside the passenger window Gives Driver and
Betty directions

HARRIS

You wanna head through Missoula
Not much there but straight up fast
food and then shoot about twenty
minutes or so down 56 Youll pass
some bombed out gas station on the
right and then about ten minutes
after that is Helen’s Place Great
fish Good pasta Knockout steak

DRIVER
Great Thanks

Harris leans in to Betty

HARRIS
This guy treating you well

Betty just stares at him Beat
HARRIS

Alright then Well you two kids
enjoy yourselves

EXT MOTEL - PARKING LOT - SAME

The BMW eases its way onto the road and pulling the U-Haul
heads north

INT BMW - DUSK
Driver and Betty drive in silence Then

DRIVER
This is all about her isn’t it

BETTY
Can you possibly imagine it being
about anyone else

DRIVER
Might we just enjoy a pleasant
dinner

Beat
BETTY

I suppose so
EXT RURAL ROAD - DUSK
The dipping sun filters orange through the dense forest The
BMW cruises navigating languid curves as it chases the day
INT BMW - NIGHT
Passing the ABANDONED GAS STATION Harris told them about

DRIVER
There it is

A sign hangs askewletters missing - HOAG’S FI LI G
STATION

BETTY

The WHITE WORK VAN IDLES next to one of the beat up
buildings

DRIVER
The gas station Restaurant must be
right up here a bit
EXT ABANDONED GAS STATION - NIGHT
As the BMW drives past headlights on Hoag’s van dim to
black
EXT HELEN’S STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
The BMW turns into the deserted parking lot Parks
Driver and Betty get out of the car Walk to the front
BETTY
I don’t think we’ll have any
trouble getting a table

DRIVER
Note to self don’t order the fish

Betty giggles
DRIVER
Ah ha A sign of forgiveness

BETTY
Don’t get carried away

INT HELEN’S STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
Cozy and cheesy Helen 60 greets her guests

HELEN
Hello there weary travelers

Driver looks at Betty “Weary travellers”

HELEN

Harris called ahead Said you’d be
in It’s awful quiet these months
Not quite summer not quite fall
No one wants to freeze their butts
off and look at a bunch of green
leaves

(beat)
Sit anywhere you want

(beat)
In about a month these parts’1l be
crawling

Driver gestures for Betty to pick a table She grabs
closest one

HELEN
You sure you want to sit there
There are some nicer --

BETTY
This will do

As they sit
HELEN
Of course Amber will be right with
you

Helen walks off Shouts into the kitchen

HELEN
Amber Table

the

INT HELEN’S STEAKHOUSE - LATER

A personable WAITRESS AMBER 18 with a hard local edge
rattles off some specials

AMBER
The fish tonight is a terrific John
Dory Fantasmic And the steak is
an aged rib-eye

DRIVER
Is it aged because no one orders
it

AMBER

Very funny Let me get you
something to drink to start

DRIVER
Wine

Suddenly the front door swings open and Hoag Albert Denny
Tamara and Flynn enter

Amber mutters
AMBER
(sotto)
Ah crap

They walk past Driver’s table Driver stares at them but
they never look his way

They grab a table and sit down Hoag snaps his fingers for
Amber’s attention
INT HELEN’S STEAKHOUSE - LATER

Driver is carving into a fat steak bloody Betty eats a
salad

DRIVER
You sure you don’t want some of
this It’s not bad at all

BETTY
I’m sure

DRIVER
Betty

She doesn’t look up Tears in her eyes fall to her cheeks
It’s tragic

Just then FLYNN flips one of the chairs and sits down with
them

Driver and Betty share a troubling look

FLYNN
You people from around here

Beat Flynn turns to his companions

FLYNN
I think they’re mutes

DRIVER
We’re just passing through

Flynn looks out to the parking lot Sees the BMW and the U-
Haul

FLYNN
Are you moving

DRIVER
Relocating

FLYNN
Must make you nervous

DRIVER
What’s that

FLYNN
Travelling with all your worldly
belongings
Driver looks at Betty
DRIVER
(re Betty)
This is my only worldly belonging

FLYNN
Aw That’s sweet

Betty turns to Flynn

BETTY
Please We don’t want any trouble

FLYNN
Excuse me

DRIVER
Look just forget it

Flynn smacks the table with the palm of his hand silencing
Driver

FLYNN
Way I see it your girl views me as
the unsavory type Is that true Do
you see me as someone not worth
knowing Uncouth perhaps

Flynn reaches across the table and places his palm over
Betty’s hand

FLYNN
Is that how it is

Driver stands up but Betty pulls her hand away first
BETTY
(to Driver)
Don’t

Flynn is on his feet as well Stares Driver down

FLYNN
You best listen to the girl --

Hoag places his firm hand on Flynn’s shoulder The others are
next to him with bags of take-out

HOAG
Don’t mind my buddy here His idea
of friendliness is to scare the
tourists

Flynn smiles a broad grin at Driver and Betty

FLYNN
Boo

HOAG
Let’s go

Flynn pauses then follows the others as they exit the
restaurant As they leave Flynn mutters softly

FLYNN
(sotto)
Seems Christmas come early this
year
And as the door closes

Amber appears next to the table

AMBER
Sorry about them They’re the local
color that insist on painting
everything black All small town’s
got ‘em

Driver observes through the window as Hoag Tamara and Albert
climb into a Dodge pick-up Flynn and Denny get on their
bikes Multiple engines roar to life and the vehicles kick up
gravel out of the parking lot

DRIVER
That’s fine
(beat)
We’1ll just take a check thanks

EXT HELEN’S STEAKHOUSE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Driver and Betty walk to their car Driver disengages the
alarm

He opens the door for Betty As she slips into the passenger
seat she notices him staring off down the road

BETTY
Don’t worry about it

He snaps out of it
DRIVER
People like thattheylack

creativity

BETTY
There are worse sins

DRIVER
Not many

He walks around the driver’s side and gets in

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

Heading back the BMW passes the abandoned gas station It’s
empty now

INT BMW - NIGHT

Driver and Betty drive into the bleak night Headlights pick
up the occasional set of eyes peering curiously off the road

Driver is stone Betty sits morose in the passenger seat The
tension in the air is thick

DRIVER
I thought we were moving on

BETTY
That’s easy for you to say

DRIVER
Can’t we just let it go Agree to
disagree

BETTY

I’ve been here before remember I
replaced the last one I’1ll never

forget how I felt when you got rid
of her Like it was just a matter

of time

DRIVER
That’s not going to happen In fact
it’s demeaning that you view our
relationship in those terms

BETTY
It feels the same now
(beat)
I’m fighting for my life here

DRIVER
If it’s a fight you want there can
be only one outcome You might want
to do some soul searching before
you go there

Just then a MOTORCYCLE flies past the car Must be going 180
mph And then the other one

BETTY
Oh my God

Driver weaves to the side of the road He looks in the side
mirror Nothing

BETTY
You shouldn’t have started with
those locals They were weird

DRIVER
They don’t know from weird

Driver accelerates Ahead

The MOTORCYCLES HAVE TURNED AROUND Blinding HALOGEN

He flips his lights back on and --

HOAG is dead center in the middle of the road He wields a
SLEDGEHAMMER right at DRIVER’S WINDOW and

The WINDSHIELD EXPLODES Glass showers Driver and Betty
Betty screams

DRIVER cranks the steering wheel

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

ON THE BMW - The right front tire BLOWS

The RIM bends and twists under the wheel well and the axel
SNAPS
The BMW fishtails

The U-HAUL throws off the distribution of weight and
suddenly

The BMW twists over itself and FLIPS

The U-Haul SNAPS at the hitch and bounces off the road into a
tree as -

INTEXT BMW - SAME

Driver and Betty are batted back and forth as the BMW rolls
tires popping against the charred blacktop windows
imploding

There’s a moment of anti-gravity as everything loose in the
car just hangs in the air and

Betty’s head smashes against the door and then the dash
Drivers WALLET ricochets off the interior of the car
settling in the back seat as

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

The car finally comes to a stop A smoking heap in the middle
of the road

No movement Just the eerie post collision silence

And then EMERGENCY LIGHTS speckle the road

INT BMW - NIGHT
Driver is in and out of consciousness He looks over at -

Betty looks dead Her head rests on her chest Blood drips a
thick hot soup from her nose and mouth

And then Drivers door opens cranked ripped off People are
in the car with him Orders being given but warped like
underwater

Driver tries to move can’t and PASSES OUT

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT
A SERIES OF SHOTS -
Driver dragged out of the car onto the road

Betty’s passenger door cranked off its hinges A bowie knife
cutting her free of her belt

Betty dragged and placed next to Driver

Heavy chains UNSPOOLED from the tow truck

The BMW is cranked up onto a flatbed tow truck

The U-Haul is pulled from the woods

Clothes and boxes scattered along the road

A smashed TV

DVD’s like so many ornaments litter the roadside brush

Drivers eyes flutter open The smell and smoke of the crash
still thick in the air He looks up at the open night sky

A FIGURE OF A MAN hovers over him

Driver spits blood and the man delivers a canon punch with a
GIANT MEATY FIST

BLACKOUT

INT ROOM - NIGHT

Driver wakes He’s being dragged across a concrete floor He
looks from side to side

An empty room Cinderblock walls Completely bare of
furniture

He lifts his head to get a better look at his captor
We recognize the GIANT Driver manages a few words

DRIVER
The girl Is she alive

The Giant stops and turns framed in the bare light of the
room He LIFTS DRIVER BY HIS FEET and WHIPS him like a wet
towel cracking Drivers skull against the hard floor

OUT AGAIN

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

A FLATBED TOW TRUCK carrying the BMW and the remains of the U-
Haul bounces down a rough driveway to a nondescript unkempt
three story house that’s set far enough back from the road to
never be noticed Lights are on inside Music Loud
conversation

The tow truck pulls up alongside a low slung work shed
Mostly corrugated steel and boarded up windows It parks next
to the Dodge pick-up and the two motorcycles

Albert and Flynn get out They walk across the lawn thick
with crabgrass and weeds Hoag meets them halfway

HOAG
Look at that mess

FLYNN
We’‘ll strip her down There’s parts
there Any idea on the driver

HOAG
Some uppity pussy There’s a payday
here it’s just a matter of finding
it Pour some drinks boys cause
tomorrow we got some torturing to
do

Flynn and Albert head inside Hoag stands staring at the
wrecked car and U-Haul He spits before turning around and
walks back to the house

EXT ABANDONED GAS STATION - DAWN

The sun eases over the hills striking the decrepit buildings
with morning light

A CB squawks off screen

MANS VOICE (0S)

Brother Wake his ass up

INT ROOM - LATER

A pool of blood catches Driver’s reflection

POV - OF DRIVER - slumped forward handcuffed to a chair in
the center of the room A Rorschach test of blood smeared
across his face

A single light in the otherwise dark grey room illuminates
him

Driver stirs He looks up at

BETTY sits across from him handcuffed as well She’s been
crying She turns her head away not looking at him

The Giant emerges from the shadows In this light the
speckled rays of dawn coming through the slit windows he’s
the embodiment of ominous

DRIVER
Who are you

GIANT
Your worst fucking nightmare

Beat

DRIVER
You’ve been talking to my shrink

GIANT
A comedian

The Giant waves a huge GLEAMING HUNTING KNIFE

GIANT
This strike you as funny

He holds the knife to Betty’s soft white throat

EXT HOUSE - DAY

The BMW is lowered onto the lawn

MOMENTS LATER -

FLYNN is going through the car He finds Drivers wallet
Opens it Flips through a wad of cash

INT ROOM - DAY

Driver looks through bloody matted hair at the Giant

DRIVER
(to Betty)
Have they hurt you

The Giant pulls Betty’s head back Caresses her throat with
the knife

GIANT
No talking

Flynn walks around the car POCKETING DRIVERS WALLET He
taps the side of the BMW with his knuckles Gets to the
TRUNK

Jams a CROWBAR into the space just under the lock

POPPING THE TRUNK It’s full of clothes scattered paper
more DVD’s all individually dated Flynn gets close and then
reels back

FLYNN
Fucking stink
INT ROOM - DAY
Betty stares at Driver
BETTY
I’ve made a decision Don’t think

it’s rash

The Giant presses the blade into her neck A DROP OF BLOOD
stains the feathered steel

GIANT
No talking means shut the fuck up

A resignation is drawn across her features

EXT HOUSE - SAME

Flynn his face screwed up from the smell braves the odor
and PULLS some clothing out of the trunk Throws it on the
ground Goes back to the trunk pulls some more clothing
and

REVEALS - A COMPARTMENT Latched from within the trunk

INT ROOM - DAY

A single tear drops from Betty’s eye

BETTY
It’s the best thing for the two of
us

DRIVER

She smiles at him

He leans in curious Suddenly through one of the
airholes

AN EYE It blinks

INT ROOM - DAY

Betty DRAGS HER THROAT against the blade BLOOD GOUTS just
as

EXT HOUSE - DAY

The compartment within the trunk is KICKED OFF ITS HINGES to
REVEAL --

THE GIRL FROM THE OPEN THE MISSING GIRL FROM THE NEWS EMMA

Shorter hair pale wild eyes wearing a pretty flowered
dress identical to the one Betty is wearing

She’s strapped down Leather cuffs preventing her escape
Leather gag clamped across her mouth

Her terrified eyes plead with him “Please save me”

INT ROOM - DAY

Betty thrashes The wound yawns and blood comes in thick
waves

As the Giant tries to keep Betty from thrashing

ON DRIVERS HANDCUFFED WRISTS - He reaches his right hand
with his left and

DISLOCATES his THUMB FOLDS HIS PALM like a slice of pizza
and SLOWLY pulls his hand free

Betty gasps for breath that bubbles up at her throat
The Giant turns his attention to Driver

Driver his head hung low seems wracked with devastation He
shakes his head from side to sideslowly

GIANT
Why’d she do that you --

The Giant reaches for him just as --
DRIVER WHIPS HIS ARM and catches the Giant through his LOWER
MANDIBLE with the open end of the handcuff It punctures the
LOWER PALATE and locks literally handcuffing the big
fucker’s jaw
DRIVER

He YANKS the Giant down and grabs the KNIFE from him Driver
spins the blade in his hand

How many are in the house Do the
math Quick

Minus one and a half really Okay

Driver RELEASES the rope

Hoag rockets toward the chipper blades The rest are SFX

INT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Tamara sits at the kitchen table a bottle of cheap vodka in
front of her She looks in shock Flynn enters

She pours herself a shot and downs it Flynn pulls out a
chair Sits down

FLYNN
You know how much he meant to me
How much I liked him

He pours himself a shot Drinks

FLYNN
But I particularly liked his taste
in women

Tamara grabs the bottle Places it next to her

TAMARA
That’s awfully romantic Flynn but
I don’t go for chicken shits

FLYNN
I’m sorry I wasn’t brave enough for
you but let me ask you thishow
would you feel about splitting two
million dollars reward money
(beat)
Think about it

Tamara just stares at him but he can see the wheels
spinning Gives a miniscule grin Tamara looks toward the
kitchen window which RATTLES in it’s frame when

SUDDENLY OFFSCREEN - A EXPLOSION KA-BOOM

The WINDOWS SHATTER blowing shards of glass into the room

Flynn dives on top of Tamara Their faces inches
apartFlynn goes in for a kiss

Tamara KNEES him in the balls

TAMARA
What the fuck is wrong with you

She gets up a bolts into

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Albert Amber and Emma are staring out the back window the
TOW TRUCK is in flames

Albert turns as Tamara runs in Flynn limps in behind her

FLYNN
FUCK FUCK FUCK

ANOTHER EXPLOSION -

They all flinch at the sound Through the front window we
see

Albert’s PICK-UP is in flames

AMBER
He’s trapping us here

ALBERT
When we don’t show up Angel’s
gonna come looking

TAMARA
He’s right

EMMA
Oh so Angel’s going to save you

Flynn turns to Amber

FLYNN
Amber get this bitch outta my
sight cause if I have to hear one
more fucking word --

EXT ABANDONED GAS STATION - NIGHT

An EIGHTEEN WHEELER rolls into the lot Takes it’s time to
park behind the STORE ROOM

The driver’s side door opens and

EXT EIGHTEEN WHEELER - NIGHT

ANGEL 45 year old tatted out highway smuggler jumps out of
the cab

He lights a smoke Inhales Ahhh
ANGEL
HOAG Come out come out wherever

you are

He kicks it against the chrome bumper and waits Takes a long
drag

ANGEL
HOAG Where the fuck are you
people
INT HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

Emma stands at a small circular window in the peak of the
attic staring out

From behind her
AMBER
I bet you want to kill the man who
did this to you
EMMA
Your powers of perception are
staggering

Beat

AMBER
Does helove you

Emma leans her head against the glass

EMMA
Yeahhe loves me
Puts her hand up to the window

MATCH CUT TO

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT
Emma’s HAND pressed up against a damp stone wall

REVEAL - Emma is crouched in the corner face turned away
from

DRIVER standing against the far wall She flattens herself
against the wall and huddles in silence

DRIVER
Today we’re going to advance to
something much more challenging

Driver drops down before her sits Indian style

DRIVER

(earnest)
Let’s meditate for a moment on the
power you have over living things
The gift we bestow just by
allowing innocent life to

(deep inhale)
take its next breath

Emma mutters something

DRIVER
I’m sorry

Silence He lifts her face She looks up with deep hatred

DRIVER
Say again

EMMA
I don’t want to know

DRIVER
That’s not for you to decide

Driver walks around the bare windowless room He knocks on
the walls
DRIVER

The only thing keeping you in
hereis me Anything happens to
me and there’s only one single
outcome

(beat)
You die But not an unremarkable
death Fun fact There documented
cases in which prisoners who were
found in cages long after their
captors surrendered typically
POW’s you know that well left to
their final desperate measures and
to evade starvation they actually
cannibalized themselves You know
what the technical term for that
is

EMMA
Pleasestop

DRIVER
Sarcophagy Onomatopoeic dont’cha
think

He pulls a BOX CUTTER from his pocket

DRIVER
Now Emma listen carefullywhen
the arterial vein is sliced the
body tends to bleed out within ten
minutes It’s not like in the
movies when someone’s jugular is
severed and they immediately drop
dead It takes a while But it’s
also impossible for the victim to
administer the proper medical help
Do you know what that is

EMMA
Ino

DRIVER
No biggie I’m no doctor either I
can tell you this much though
Elevate the wound over the heart
and apply pressure to the area And
bandage tightly That’s important

EMMA
Why are you telling me this

Driver has opened the BOX CUTTER baring the gleaming razor

edge

DRIVER
Because as much as you hate me you
now have the opportunity to save my
life
Driver SLICES HIS NECK with the box cutter

DRIVER
I love you Emma

Blood SPURTS splattering Emma’s face Driver’s hand goes
instinctively to his neck but with the blood pumping between
his finger he promptly drops to his knees

EMMA
You’re fucking crazy

DRIVER
Yeah sorry about that

Driver falls face first at Emma’s feet BLACKOUT

INT HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

EMMA
You and your father you not get
along

AMBER

Put it this way He wasn’t the best
role model

Beat

EMMA
He’1l torture him Kill him in ways
that no one should ever imagine

AMBER
Hmm
(beat)
Why didn’t he do that to you

EMMA
I think he was trying tocreate
me Build something out of despair

AMBER
He hurt you

EMMA
At times He would get carried
away

AMBER

Like those scars

EMMA
Like the scars

AMBER
(points to her stomach)
And what about the one right there

Emma looks down lifts her shirt and runs her fingers along a
SCAR that is IDENTICAL to the one we noticed on Betty’s
stomach earlier

EMMA
Amber you don’t want to know his
kind of love

Fear is beginning to consume Amber

EMMA
You’re a nice person You should
have run when you had the chance

AMBER
Can you help us You know him You
can figure out how to end this

EMMA
Except right nowit’s only just
begun

And we see
EMMA’S POV - Driver standing in the MOONLIGHT a thick

BURLAP SACK dripping blood in his hand He stares up at the
window He whispers something but we can’t read his lips

Then he touches his throat tracing a long healed scar

AMBER
Is there someone out there

Amber approaches the window

AMBER’S POV - Driver is gone Just a deep red stain on the
grass The sloughing of Hoag

EXT ABANDONED GAS STATION - NIGHT

Angel walks through the lot We’re with him when he spots --
THE BURNED OUT VAN

Angel approaches Looks around Clearly this is recent Runs
his finger along the side Still warm

ANGEL
HOAG

It’s dark on this side of the station and pitch black in the
burned out van

Angel takes out his ZIPPO He reaches through the drivers
window and FLICKS THE LIGHTER to --

REVEAL - BETTY’S BURNED CORPSE

Angel SCREAMS and panics and KNOCKS Betty’s head which snaps
at the neck like a fried pretzel and DROPS INTO HER LAP
Angel fumbles the lighter Drops it into the van and STUMBLES
back falling on his ass gets up and then runs back to his
truck

ALBERT

Denny begins to cough A wracking hack Blood bubbles up at
his lips and choking he pukes blood

ALBERT
Oh fuck Tamara Help

Tamara takes Denny’s head and props him up higher

TAMARA
He’s going to die if we don’t get

The impossibility of this is staggering

FLYNN

TAMARA

AMBER APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY She pushes Emma into the room

AMBER
I’m with Albert We take our
chances on the Jeep

Tamara takes Emma by the arm and pushes her onto the couch
Then she turns on Amber

TAMARA
No one cares what you think

AMBER
Just cause my old man was givin’
you the deep dicking doesn’t make
you my mother bitch

(MORE)

AMBER (CONTD)
And with Hoag dead that pretty
much makes this my fucking house
so get the fuck out
Tamara turns her back on Amber

TAMARA
Suck me

Amber hauls off and sucker punches Tamara Tamara goes down
FLYNN
(pumped)
HELLO

And Tamara comes back all hellcat Full on pulling hair
kicking punching

Tamara and Amber fall into the couch on top of DENNY

DENNY
OHHHHHH

And then onto the floor They’ve got each other by the hair
trading punches

Albert’s looking for a way to grab one of them

ALBERT

Flynn shakes his head exasperated gets into the middle and
tries to grab Tamara but she HEADBUTTS him with the back of
her head

He stumbles back Nose gushing

FLYNN
GODDAMNIT

The girls flip over They’re back on their feet now kicking
and slapping

They fall into Denny again

DENNY
OHHHHHH

Tamara bites Amber’s tit She screams and sinks her teeth
into the back of Tamara’s head

Albert makes his move Tamara kicks him in the balls and he
crumbles

ALBERT
Oh dear Godpain

Flynn is staunching the bleeding from his nose Tamara sees
the 44 sticking out of Flynn’s waistband

Flynn looks to the front door Hears something

Tamara grabs the gun Turns it on Amber Cocks it Pulls the
trigger --

FLYNN’S HAND COMES DOWN ON THE HAMMER IN MID DESCENT

He yanks the gun away from Tamara

FLYNN
There’s someone at the door

Silence Then a THUDechoes down the hallway

INT HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Indeed there’s a DULL POUNDING at the front door
THUD THUD

Flynn Tamara Albert and Amber all stand near and around the

Beat THUD

ALBERT
Flynn is right Hoag’s dead

FLYNN
Well take a look

They all look at Flynn like he’s out of his mind THUD

ALBERT

FLYNN

right up against there and the
second I put my eye up thereBAM
So no fucking thanks

Amber pushes her way forward

AMBER
You gigantic pussies I’11 look

AMBER PUTS HER EYE TO THE PEEPHOLE
The others all take a step back

AMBER’S POV - A BURLAP SACK hanging from a rope swings in
the wind knocking against the door

AMBER
It’s a bag

FLYNN
What kind of bag

Amber turns to the others Dawns on her that they were all
just waiting for her head to get blown off

AMBER
(pushes past Flynn)
I don’t know A bag

Flynn looks through the peephole Again the others take a
protective step back

Flynns POV - The SACK swinging in the wind

FLYNN
He’s trying to bait us

TAMARA
Well duh

Flynn steps away from the door Paces

ALBERT
What

FLYNN
I don’t know what to do

TAMARA
What we do is not open the door

FLYNN

Whatever’s in the bag is bad

Flynn can’t stop pacing

ALBERT

Flynn turns Stares at the door Before anyone can stop him
he

REACHES for the knob and SWINGS THE DOOR OPEN He stands
there all brave and scared shitless at once

FLYNN

ASSHOLES BRING IT

But nothing happens And now it’s just him and the swinging
burlap sack

The SACK spins lazily from it’s rope to REVEAL - Hoag’s
SHOTGUN is sewn onto the other side Flynn backs away

FLYNN
What the hell

Flynn stares into the darkness then turns to the group

FLYNN
Why would he give us back the gun

TAMARA
To send a message

FLYNN
Yeah What kind of stupid message
is that “Shoot me fuckers I want
to die”

EMMA
He’s evening the playing field

FLYNN
Since when is this a fucking game

The SACK drips blood on the front porch

EMMA
For him since the beginning

FLYNN
You know ominous is a terribly
unattractive quality

TAMARA

ALBERT
Leave it Close the damn door
Flynn

FLYNN

It’s a gun dipshit You put
bullets in it and blow douche bag’s
head into Chunky Soup You don’t

Flynn grabs the gun and TEARS it away from the bag which in
effect causes

The BURLAP SACK splits down the middle
AND HOAG SPILLS OUT ONTO THE FRONT PORCH

Everyone SCREAMS Tamara backpeddles in blood and pieces of
Hoag Pandemonium

Amber is STARING AT HER FATHER’S MASK OF A FACE She starts
SCREAMING UNCONTROLLABLY

NEARBY TREE

Amber looks fierce

EXT HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

PULLS THE TRIGGER putting Albert down

rubber out of the garage

Flynn uses his palm to wipe away the slick of blood clotting
his vision

FLYNN
Sick

He fishtails down the driveway grinding gravel

EMMA
Turn on your lights

FLYNN
Did I ask for your opinion

Being an ass hair away from death has kicked Emma into
serious fuck you mode

EMMA
We’ve come this far it would be
nice to actually live

Flynn strains to see out the windshield Between the blood
and the darkness there’s negative visibility

Car fishtails
The Jeep hits pavement and Flynn flips his lights

A HUGE FUCKING DEER is standing dead center in the middle
the road

EVERYONE braces for impact

But Flynn swerves at the very last second and

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Driver finds the spot where Amber stripped off her jacket
assesses his options staring into the thick woods
listening

Suddenly something BEEPS BEEP BEEP BE

He REACHES INTO HIS POCKET and stops the sound He looks
behind him back toward the house

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

The Jeep screams down the road

She pops the trunk on an old Chevy Finds a TIRE IRON in
back
She hefts it in her hand It’ll have to do

She looks to the house Debates whether or not to go inside
She turns to the woods

No sign of Driver

She ducks down behind the car Tries to catch her breath
Waits a few beats and then

SLOWLY STANDS UP She scans the perimeter She’s all alone
Takes a deep breath FEELS A PRESENCE

Amber SPINS AROUND swinging the TIRE IRON
DRIVER swings his AXE and they meet in the middle
DRIVER
Couldn’t be happy with a twenty

percent tip could you

Driver hooks the tire iron with the axe and rips it from
Ambers hands

He SWINGS THE AXE at Amber’s face
She arches her back and the blade GRAZES her FOREHEAD

Amber stumbles back Falls on her ass Driver comes at her
She kicks at him catching his KNEE with her heel

Driver drops to his other knee

AMBER
Fuck you

Amber scrambles to her feet and runs for the house Driver
uses the axe to pull himself back up and LURCHES AFTER HER

But Amber is fast She races up the front porch and gets
inside Slams the door
INT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT

Amber stands against the door holding it closed Driver hits
it from the outside It shudders but holds

AMBER
LEAVE ME ALONE

The BLADE of the AXE punches through the door an inch from
Ambers head

She stares at the reflection of her eye in the gleaming blade
and then RUNS

DRIVER kicks the door off its hinges
Amber runs up the stairs four at a time

HER FOOT GOES THROUGH THE FLOORBOARD She turns as Driver is
upon her but

Amber grabs for the banister It splinters in her hand and --
SHE SWINGS THE BROKEN PIECE AT DRIVER’S HEAD Catches him in
the temple and he stumbles back loses his footing and FALLS
BACKWARD DOWN THE STAIRS

He lays still at the bottom

Amber tugs her foot free

Driver stirs Hand to head He gets to his feet

And Amber is moving again Up the stairs She crosses to the
bedrooms where

INT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME

We make out Amber’s terrified eye peeking through a wide
CRACK in the wall

INT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - CRAWLSPACE - NIGHT

Amber slowly backs out of the crawlspace Ducks around the
wall She can hear Drivergetting closer Closer

Amber flattens against the wall The SOUND of Driver dragging
the axe against the walls She holds her hand over her mouth
to keep herself from screaming

Stone still she listens Doesn’t hear a thing Gathers the
courage to

PEEK AROUND THE CORNER OF THE WALL

DRIVER IS RIGHT IN HER FACE and HAS HIS HAND over his own
MOUTH TRYING TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM SCREAMING MOCKING HER

Defiantly he throws the axe to the floor Beckons her with a
flutter of fingers

DRIVER

Amber looks for a way out There is none So she does what
any good hellcat can do

SHE CHARGES DRIVER JUMPS AT HIM and

Driver SNAPS his arm

THE GRANDDADDY OF ALL HUNTING KNIVES shoots out from within
his sleeve and slips smoothly into the palm of his hand It’s
coronation time

Driver meets her in the center of the room

The knife catches her in the sternum

Driver runs her into the wall and pins her like a bug feet
dangling off the ground

Amber stares at the knife sticking out of her chest

AMBER

DRIVER
But if I let you downyou
mightcrawl away

She wriggles in place oblivious to the pain Blood bubbles
up in the corners of her mouth

DRIVER
Okayfine

He pulls the knife and Amber drops to the floor Driver
watches her for a moment She presses her hand to her chest

DRIVER
It’s totally amazing that you’re
actually still alive

He descends on her knife in full arch Plunges the blade
deep Again Again Again

Hello Sheriff

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

Angel’s EIGHTEEN WHEELER barrels down the road It’s
headlights illuminate

ANGEL’S POV - In the distance Driver bloody dirty
walking

DRIVER hears the roar of tires against asphalt A smile
creases his lips His kind of car

As the truck slows

DRIVER steps out into the middle of the road Holds his arms
up for the truck to stop and then dramatically --

SINKS TO HIS KNEES blocking the road The truck stops and
ANGEL gets out stands cautiously next to the cab

ANGEL
Buddy you might be the icing on my
shit cake of a night

He reaches into the truck and yanks a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN off
its spot on the door

ANGEL
Now why don’t you tell me how you
came to looking so fucked up

Driver sits prone Head hung low As Angel approaches gun
aimed low even with the crown of Driver’s skull

ANGEL
I’m talking to you fella

He shoves the gun under Driver’s chin and lifts his face to
the moonlight Driver stands before him

ANGEL
Is that blood on your face

DRIVER
What’s with all the questions

Driver KICKS Angel in the chest just as

ANOTHER EIGHTEEN WHEELER roars down the other side of the
road and Angel is jacked between THE CAB and THE LOAD He
vanishes under the remaining 12 wheels

The passing truck doesn’t even register the death and keeps
going

Driver walks along the stain that was once Angel and climbs
into the cab of the dead man’s truck

shotgun

Emma stumbles back into the bathroom mouth gushing

TAMARA

blade Legs kicking wildly as blood and water spiral down the
drain

SHERIFF

outside with me

Flynn steps out with the Sheriff

EXT MOTEL - ROOM 15 - NIGHT

The Sheriff has his back turned to Flynn as he walks several
paces away from the door

SHERIFF

Now I think we have ourselves a
case of identity confusion Harris
here at the Highwayman seems to
remember a fella coming through
with the same name as you

(beat)
Now I know that wouldn’t be so
strange if it wasn’t for the
fella’s name being so unusual

As he turns around Flynn pulls his gun and

BLAM The slug punches a softball size hole through the
middle of the Sheriff’s face

INT MOTEL - ROOM 15

She hold out her hands to REVEAL - she’s been gutted and
Tamara’s insides fall out onto the gravel parking lot

EMMA

Tamara falls to her knees and then face first onto her own
internal organs

THE SOUND OF A CAR REVVING andFlynn and Emma turn to
see

THE SHERIFF’S CAR IN REVERSE BEARING DOWN ON THEM

Emma runs Flynn fumbles with his gun is about to take aim
when --

The CAR HITS FLYNN He pirouettes over the trunk bounces off
the hood and slams onto the parking lot
INT SHERIFFS CAR - SAME

Driver SNAPS THE CAR INTO DRIVE and

EXT MOTEL - SAME

EMMA RUNS toward the construction zone at the far end of the
parking lot

Suddenly she’s bathed in headlights
THE SHERIFF’S CAR IS BEARING DOWN ON HER

She makes it to the pavement’s edge and slides down a steep
embankment just as

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

THE SHERIFF’S CAR PLOWS through a pile of dirt and gravel and
catches air

The CAR clears Emma and NOSE DIVES twelve feet down the
embankment slamming grill first and turtle-backs hard
crushing the roof

Suddenly everything is very quiet

As the dust settles

THE DOOR TO THE CRUISER KICKS OPEN

Emma can’t believe it

DRIVER crawls out of the car His shoulder is badly
dislocated It’s pretty fucking ugly He grabs his wrist and
JERKS his shoulder back into its socket CRUNCH

AND THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND IT’S BIZARRE THE LOVE IN
DRIVER’S EYES IS SO REAL

Emma shakes her head This can’t be happening Not again

She runs

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

Emma sprints past a slew of heavy machinery
Driver limps after her

She turns Sees him She’s hysterical

EMMA
LEAVE ME ALONE

Keeps running Driver is silent in his pursuit As they near
a column

FLYNN TURNS THE CORNER BEAT UP BUT STILL TICKING SHOTGUN
IN HIS HAND

Life slows down Emma hits the dirt just as

Flynn FIRES catching Driver in the chest and he is launched
backward He lands hard Lays there not moving

Flynn walks forward Approaches prone Driver

Suddenly Driver heaves back arching catching his breath
Flynn backs away

He claws at his chest to REVEAL -- a BULLETPROOF VEST under
his coveralls He pulls at it loosening it taking the
tightness out of his lungs when he looks up at

FLYNN smiles his finger on the trigger

FLYNN
Do they make one of those for your
face
CRACK Emma delivers a shovel blow to the side of Flynns

skull
Flynn drops like a stone
Emma picks up the shotgun Driver struggles to sit up
DRIVER
Must admit I didn’t see that
coming
Emma turns the gun on him
EMMA

Let him get the honor of killing
you I don’t think so

DRIVER
Emma C’mon We have a special
something

EMMA

You’re out of your mind

DRIVER
No I’m very much in my mind

Driver struggles to his feet

DRIVER
After all weve been through
you’re going to go with this Don’t

EMMA
This isn’t one of your sociopathic
stagings This is you dying

DRIVER
Now there it is If this were I
don’t know say one of my
sociopathic stagings I would have
you say exactly that

He takes a step toward her
DRIVER
And then I would say “Go ahead
pull the trigger”

EMMA
No problem

Emma pulls the trigger An EMPTY CLICK
DRIVER
College girlsthey think they got
it all figured out
He takes the barrel in his hand and
DRIVER
It’s called pump action for a

reason

YANKS THE GUN FREE FROM HER GRIP Pumps it and FIRES IT right
past her head BAM She doesn’t even flinch

But she doesn’t run either She’s resigned
DRIVER
You can’t kill me Emma I’m deep
inside you
He places the gun at his side and FLICKS OUT HIS ARM --
The HUNTING KNIFE slides into the palm of his hand

He places his palm on the back of her neck and JAMS THE KNIFE
RIGHT OVER HER PELVIS at the point of HER TWO INCH SCAR

DRIVER
Now it’s my turn to set you free

Emma gasps at the pain Driver holds her tight as we go --
CLOSE ON - Driver plunges his fingers into the cut digging

into Emma’s abdomen right under her skin between the fat and
muscle

DRIVER
(softly in her ear)
Breathe

And PULLS OUTA BLOODY TRANSISTOR A GPS DEVICE THAT HAD
BEEN EMBEDDED INTO HER FLESH

Driver pushes away from Emma She looks up at him

DRIVER
Now it’s your turn to find me

Emma drops to her knees holding her bleeding side Driver
picks up the gun notices

FLYNN is pulling himself along the gravel

ON FLYNN - He looks around for Driver Sees Emma alone
holding her side and

BUMPS INTO DRIVER’S BOOTS Shotgun hanging at his heel Eyes
peel upward

ON DRIVER - He flips Flynn onto his back Lays a heavy foot
on Flynns chest

Driver looks up the embankment

HARRIS the motel owner stands silently watching from the
embankment’s edge

DRIVER
(to Harris)
I think this fella stole my wallet

Driver reaches down and PLUCKS HIS WALLET from Flynns
pocket

DRIVER
Look at that
(beat)
Stop Thief

And nonchalantly points the shotgun against Flynn’s face and
BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF

Harris is frozen in fear
DRIVER
One of the unfortunate drawbacks to

learning my name

AS WE GO TO BLACKANOTHER SHOTGUN BLASTand the SOUND OF
SIRENS

INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

It’s controlled mayhem Clearly it’s been a busy night

INT HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT

A DOCTOR we don’t see his face walks down the hallway He
looks in on several patients and stops at

DENNY Wounds dressed Drugged Resting peacefully

The Doctor approaches Denny’s bed He reviews the chart
Flips through it Denny opens his eyes

ON THE DOCTOR - It’s DRIVER He smiles at Denny

DRIVER
No one lives

And he DRIVES THE CHART INTO DENNY’S THROAT and PUSHES with
all his strength until

Denny’s HEAD FALLS AWAY FROM HIS BODY

EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

An AMBULANCE roars up and parks LOCAL NEWS CREWS ARE ALREADY
ON THE SCENE

Paramedics race around and open the back and wheel out --

EMMA on a gurney The NEWSCASTERS descend on the girl but
are strong-armed by the paramedics as they wheel her past

DRIVER He turns away an imperceptible inch and just like
that Emma is gone enveloped again into the womb of the real
world

FADE OUT

THE END
