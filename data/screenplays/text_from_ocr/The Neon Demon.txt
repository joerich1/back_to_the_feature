DRAFT 11114
INT STUDIO - DAY 1
CLOSE ON JESSES face eyes closed angelic beautiful

Slowly the CAMERA PULLS BACK and her twisted bleeding body
is revealed tangled in a tattered dress It appears a
violent crime has just taken place

CLOSE ON a mans face It is DEAN handsome slightly
awkward He stares at the scene entranced by Jesses
figure

He raises a still camera Jesse’s image is reflected in
miniature in the glass lens He takes a photo and the black
shutter closes and opens on Jesse’s body the mechanical
sound a startling contrast to the eerie quiet of the room

The CAMERA PULLS BACK again revealing that the crime scene
is actually a fashion photo shoot

The clicks of Dean’s camera uneven at first grow rapid and
regular A frenetic percussive score With every shot a
new image of Jesse appears on the nearby computer screen

As though waking from a dream Jesse’s eyes open

INT MAKE-UP ROOM - DAY 2
She is seated in front of a mirror staring at her reflection
with wide eyes Her face still appears bloody and battered
from the shoot

She begins taking off the make-up

From across the room RUBY 27 simultaneously iron-willed
and fragile watches her every move Jesse senses her gaze

RUBY
Am I staring

JESSE
I don’t mind

RUBY
Sorry Occupational hazard

Ruby waves a fist full of make-up brushes
JESSE

(a revelation)
You did my make-up
RUBY
Yeah Like an hour ago You don’t
remember

JESSE
Sorry -

RUBY

What did you have a stroke between
then and now

JESSE
I thought you were in the next
shoot

Ruby laughs Jesse doesn’t understand the joke

RUBY
(touched)
Oh you’re serious
JESSE
Yeah
RUBY

Well here let me help you

Ruby rushes over and begins wiping away some bloody make-up
out of reach behind Jesse’s ear

RUBY (CONTD)
I’m Ruby by the way

JESSE
I’m —-

RUBY
Jesse You told me earlier
Youre a little bit deer-in-the-
headlights

JESSE
I just moved here Six weeks ago

RUBY
Please don’t be from New York
Last thing we need is another
pretty bitch without a soul

JESSE
I’m from Ridgecrest

RUBY
Where’s that
JESSE
Near Death Valley

RUBY
Spooky What’s in Death Valley

JESSE
Nothing worth sticking around for

Ruby smiles a genuine understanding

RUBY
Your skin is perfect Look at you

She leans in examining Jesse in the mirror their faces
nearly touching

RUBY (CONTD)

I don’t think you’re even human
(whispering)

If I killed you would you die

Ruby playfully holds up her hands covered in bloody make-up

RUBY (CONTD)
I swear I didn’t do it

She begins cleaning her hands with a small cloth

RUBY (CONTD)
Shit what time is it I promised
Dee and Dum over there a ride

Ruby nods toward two ULTRA-THIN MODELS leaning against each
other in the corner of the room They are totally bored It
looks like it takes every bit of effort to hold themselves
upright

RUBY (CONTD)
You think they’ve ever had lunch
Probably don’t even know what it
is ‘Wanna go to lunch’ Probably
think it’s a day-spa

(to Jesse)
Hey you wanna come We’re going
to this club in West Hollywood
Please You’ll be saving me from a
thirty minute ride with the world’s
only living exoskeletons

One of the thin girls sighs deeply

JESSE
Do I get shotgun
RUBY
Deal

Ruby tosses the blood-covered cloth on the make-up table
She claps loudly startling the thin girls to life

RUBY (CONTD)
Ashley Mary-Kate Andele Party
time

They stand and slink out of the room Ruby rolls her eyes as
they leave

Jesse turns back to the mirror and runs a hand down the side
of her face touching her skin

INT MAKE-UP ROOM - DUSK - LATER 3
Jesse finishes changing

Several MODELS in various states of undress sit at a row of
tables as stylists scurry between them

At the corner mirror one girl places a palm to her
reflection tears running silently down her face Jesse
notices her as she stands to go

INT STUDIO - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 4
Jesse heads through the studio toward the exit the set from
her shoot disappearing farther and farther into the
background

INT HALLWAY - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 5

She walks alone through the winding hallways of the building

INT STUDIO STAIRS - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 6

We watch from above as she spirals down a long internal
staircase

The sound of wind gradually intensifying

EXT RUBY’S CARHIGHWAY - DUSK 7

CLOSE ON the sleek hood of the car slicing through the air
It flies down the highway weaving defiantly through traffic

INT RUBY’S CAR - DUSK 8
Ruby drives the two thin models slumped in the backseat
Jesse stares out the passenger seat window mesmerized by the
neon lights of Los Angeles

Ruby pays dangerously little attention to the road in an
effort to sneak looks at Jesse

One of the thin models springs to life

THIN GIRL
You missed your exit

RUBY
Oh it speaks

The thin girl hisses at her

RUBY (CONTD)
Back in your cage

Ruby makes a risky maneuver on the highway and Jesse grips
the car door white-knuckled

RUBY (CONTD)
I won’t really kill you I promise

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 9

The car exits the highway and drives into West Hollywood

EXT RUBY’S CAR - NIGHT 10

It pulls up to the curb and screeches to a sharp halt

INT RUBY’S CAR - NIGHT 11

Jesse releases the car door stretching her cramped hand

EXT STREET - NIGHT 12

All four girls exit the car We watch them disappear down
the street headed to the club

INT WEST HOLLYWOOD CLUB - NIGHT 13

Jesse and Ruby stand inside the entrance
MUSIC BLASTS at a deafening level The tremendous main room
is completely congested with sweaty dancers The walls
lined with floor-to-ceiling mirrors reflect a galaxy of
pretty bouncing lights

Someone waves to Ruby across the room She turns to Jesse
and shouts over the music

RUBY
Be right back

JESSE
What

RUBY

Don’t go anywhere Promise

JESSE
I can’t hear you

Ruby disappears into the crowd

Jesse walks around the perimeter of the room watching the
reflections of the club in the mirrored walls

She spots a pair of eyes watching her They belong to JACK
37 leaning casually against a pillar in a shadowed corner of
the room He is striking fashionable and holds himself
with unintentional arrogance When their eyes connect it is
unclear how long he has been looking at her

SARAH 24 plenty of eyeliner flirts with him but fails to
hold his attention

Jack makes his thumbs and forefingers into a square holds
them up and squints

JACKS POV Jesse gazes back at him captured within the
frame

Sarah sees the gesture and looks across the room for the
recipient Jesse is identified

She whips around and crashes head-first into DEAN He smiles
at her

DEAN
I was hoping you would be here

Jesse cannot hear him

JESSE
I’m looking for my friend

He leans closer
JESSE (CONTD)
(louder)
Ruby Do you know Ruby

He nods in acknowledgment and gestures for Jesse to follow
him They start across the room searching for Ruby

Dean glances over his shoulder and sees Jesse struggling to
make her way through the crowd He reaches out

Their hands lock

EXT CLUB ALCOVE - NIGHT 14

Dean and Jesse push through a back door into a small dark
alcove The MUSIC still pulsing is muffled

They both exhale relieved to be away from the crowd

A LONELY SMOKER dressed in black leans against the brick wall
while two GAY MEN kiss hungrily across from her The smoker
watches them sucking her Marlboro unmoved

Jesse and Dean smile at the scene then look at each other
searching for something to say

DEAN
You hungry

She shakes her head
DEAN (CONTD)
Do you want a drink I could get

you a drink

JESSE
I’m okay

A silence
DEAN
You did great today By the way
At the shoot

JESSE
Thanks

He looks down hands in pockets and shifts nervously Jesse
watches him carefully amused
JESSE (CONTD)
Would you say I really killed
it
He looks up surprised She smiles coy

JESSE (CONTD)

Bad
DEAN
Pretty bad
JESSE
I can do worse
DEAN
Okay
JESSE

Why did they build a gate around
the cemetery

DEAN
I don’t know Why

JESSE
Because people were dying to get
in

Small laughs

JESSE (CONTD)
What do you do with a dead chemist

DEAN
What

JESSE
You Barium

More laughs They move a little closer

DEAN
Okay I’ve got one

JESSE

DEAN

DEAN
What did one dead guy say to the
other
JESSE
What

They are close enough to kiss Dean looks down at her face
He is once again enraptured

DEAN
I - can’t remember the punch line

The moment is broken as the back door swings open and music
blasts into the alcove

RUBY (0OS)
Jesse

Ruby heads toward them clutching a bottle of champagne She
is followed by GIGI 21 very charming very sexy

Ruby sizes them up trying to decide what she interrupted

JESSE
You know Dean

RUBY
Yeah sure

JESSE
We were just looking for you

RUBY
Clearly

Gigi giggles

DEAN
I should get back in there Nice
to see you Ruby And -

GIGI
Gigi
Dean places a hand on the small of Jesse’s back and whispers
in her ear

DEAN
Find me if you need a getaway

She nods

RUBY
Well that was rude

Jesse smiles unable to take her eyes off him as he walks
back into the club We move in on her face until

INT CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT 15

The sound of a POP breaks Jesse’s trance Bubbles spill down
the side of a champagne bottle

Jesse blinks and looks around the room as though only just
realizing she is there She glances curiously at some
graffiti on the wall which reads ‘DO WHAT THOU WILT’

Ruby drinks straight from the bottle perched on the edge of
the sink nearly slipping Gigi checks her reflection in the
bathroom mirror smoothing the skin around her nose

GIGI
Does my nose still look swollen

RUBY
No but your ass does

GIGI
Very funny

Someone knocks on the bathroom door
RUBY
(shouts)

We’re in here

JESSE
What happened to your nose

GIGI
Why Does it look bad

RUBY

Gigi’s going full Barbie
JESSE

What
RUBY

All plastic

Gigi slaps Ruby playfully on the backside and chases her
around the room Ruby hops on the toilet seat for safety

RUBY (CONT’D)
Sanctuary

JESSE
You had surgery

GIGI
God you say it like it’s a bad
thing

JESSE
No it’s just - have you done it a
lot

GIGI
Not really

Ruby hiccups and holds up seven fingers behind Gigi’s back
GIGI (CONTD)
I go to this guy in Beverly Hills
if you want his number
RUBY
(dreamy )
Oh Andrew

GIGI
Doctor Andrew

RUBY
You love him

GIGI
Of course I do Look at me

Gigi presents herself

GIGI (CONTD)
He calls me the Bionic Woman

JESSE
Is that a compliment

Ruby snorts champagne Someone knocks on the door again

GIGI
(shouts)
We’re in here

RUBY
Where’s Sarah I wanna dance

GIGI
Just go She’1l be lurking around
Jack for the rest of the night
poor thing

RUBY
Sarah’s in love with Jack because
they fucked once like a thousand
years ago -

GIGI
Be nice

RUBY
But everyone knows he’s only
interested in starving preteen

babydolls -

GIGI
Hey -

RUBY
What

GIGI

Not in front of the kid
Gigi and Ruby turn to Jesse

JESSE
Oh I’m not a virgin

A strange silence as the conversation comes to a halt Gigi
and Ruby exchange a quick look Ruby dangles the champagne
bottle lifelessly between her knees

Another knock at the door breaks the tension Gigi annoyed
undoes the lock and Sarah bursts in pushing Jesse behind the
door

SARAH
Well he’s stoned out of his mind
and acting like an asshole
surprise-surprise
(to Ruby)
Move

Sarah pushes Ruby off the toilet and sits to pee
SARAH (CONTD)
I’1l probably still go home with

him because I’m such a pushover

Ruby slams the bottle on the sink and storms out of the
bathroom

SARAH (CONTD)
What What did I say

Gigi presents Jesse

GIGI
Sarah this is Jesse

Jesse offers a hand but Sarah grabs the toilet paper
instead

SARAH

I think we met
INT WEST HOLLYWOOD CLUB - NIGHT - LATER 16
Even LOUDER MUSIC
Sarah Gigi and Jesse dance in the middle of the crowd
Gigi bounces around like a ball on a string She grabs
Jesses hand and spins her The world whips around in
circles
As she spins Jesse sees Ruby watching them across the dance
floor With each turn Ruby’s face becomes closer and

clearer her expression hard and fixed on Jesse

The sound of RUBBER AGAINST THE ROAD as

EXT DEAN’S CARHIGHWAY - NIGHT 17

The wheels of the car spin down the highway

INT DEAN’S CAR - NIGHT 18

Jesse stares at her reflection in the window of the car She
looks past herself and sees Dean’s reflection driving
steadily

She leans her head against the window next to his image Her
eyes begin to close

JESSES DREAM 19
A fuzzy pink surface An image out of focus After a
while the image becomes clear and we realize we are looking
at skin We see an arm A pair of shoulder blades A

collarbone An elbow A mouth Odd angles of seemingly
dismembered portions of a WOMAN’S BEAUTIFUL BODY

INT DEAN’S CARJERRY’S MOTEL - NIGHT 20
CLOSE ON Dean’s face The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see that
he is watching Jesse sleep in the passenger seat After a
few moments her eyes open and she looks around

disoriented

JESSE
Where are we

She glances out the window The motel is run-down
depressing cheap She is a little embarrassed

JESSE (CONTD)
Oh How long was I asleep

DEAN
Not long

She rubs her eyes and gathers her things
JESSE
Thanks for the ride
EXT JERRYS MOTEL - NIGHT 21

Jesse climbs up the rusty outdoor stairs to her motel door

EXT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 22

She pulls a set of keys from her bag and is about to open the
door when

DEAN (0S)
Hey

She turns and leans on the balcony rail looking down over
Dean

DEAN (CONTD)
What did one dead guy say to the
other

JESSE
What

DEAN
Nothing He’s dead

Dean smiles Jesse smiles

DEAN (CONT’D)
I want to see you again

JESSE
Okay

DEAN
Tomorrow

She nods

Dean points up and she turns her head to the sky The full
moon is perfectly luminous She gazes at it in awe as Dean’s
car springs to life and drives away

She turns to her motel room One number hangs on the door
the other has long gone missing The color has chipped away
revealing multiple coats of hideous paint The lock takes a
bit of effort with the key but it finally clicks

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 23

Jesse steps into the room leaving the front door half open
She flips the light switch a few times but it doesn’t work
Aside from the ambient moonlight shining through the window
the room is dark and eerie

Jesse tries to see into the space Her skin prickles as she
senses that something or someone is in the room She makes
out a shape in the dark which starts to approach her She
quickly steps out of the room slamming the door shut

EXT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 24

Jesse stares at the door unsure of her next move The
drapes inside the room move slightly as if someone brushed
past them

She glances around her but the parking lot is deserted The
only sounds come from televisions in neighboring rooms and
the muffled roar of the distant highway

She turns to the door again and takes a deep breath She is

about to slip her key in the lock when a loud bang hits the
door from the inside She drops the keys and walks away

INT JERRY’S MOTEL MANAGEMENT - NIGHT 25

A LITTLE BELL JINGLES as Jesse runs through the door and
hurriedly approaches the Night Manager HANK He is a fake-
tanned hair-straightened middle-aged failed actor He was
obviously once very good looking but now borders on the
grotesque

Hank sits at the front desk feet up cutting his nails with
a small switchblade

JESSE
Someone is in my room

Unimpressed he does not look up from his work

HANK
What do you mean someone is in your
room

JESSE

I went to let myself in and I
heard someone

Hank takes her in

HANK
Are you high

Jesse takes out her cell phone and starts to dial

HANK (CONTD)
What are you doing

JESSE
I’m calling the police

HANK
Whoa Relax okay

He snaps the blade shut and whistles to the back room
MIKEY a skinny grungy biker kid appears

HANK (CONTD)
Mikey

MIKEY
Yeah

HANK
This lady has an unwanted guest

Mikey looks at both of them He picks up a baseball bat

EXT JERRYS MOTEL - NIGHT 26
The threesome climb the stairs Hank following at the rear
looks at Jesse’s ass and grunts impressed She turns around
and he winks

EXT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 27

Jesse struggles to make her key work in the lock Hank sighs
impatiently

HANK
Mikey go get the spare Uh -

JESSE
Jesse
HANK
(suggestively)

Jesse and I will wait here

Mikey scrutinizes the door makes a decision and kicks it
open

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 28

Hank shines his flashlight in the room which we now see has
been torn to pieces Jesse’s clothes are scattered
everywhere

HANK
What the fuck You’re going to
have to pay for this

JESSE
I didn’t do it It wasn’t me

HANK
Nice try sweetheart We don’t
foot the bill for your pissed off
boyfriends

JESSE
I’m telling you it wasn’t me

Mikey meanwhile is investigating the room He shines a
flashlight across the back wall revealing that the window is
open

He moves the light down and stops on a crouched figure It
is a WILDCAT eating into the cheek of another dead animal on
the floor The wildcat slowly glances up and stares into the
light for a moment before returning to his meal

MIKEY
There’s your visitor

INT ELEVATOR - THE NEXT DAY 29
The SOUND OF A DING

Stainless steel elevator doors close on Jesse’s reflection
She grazes her fingers across her cheek thinking about the
wildcat from the night before

INT OFFICE BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY 30

Jesse walks down a long stark white hallway of doors

INT CASTING WAITING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 31

She opens the door to a room crowded with plastic folding
chairs FIFTY MODELS all variations of the same girl sit
anxiously quietly waiting Every head snaps to Jesse as she
steps inside

She crosses to the CHECK-IN GIRL at a folding table in the
corner The Girl twenty-something smacks her gum hard and
does not look up from the fashion magazine she is reading

CHECK-IN GIRL
Write down your name and your
agency Have a seat They’ll call
you in

Jesse scribbles her information on the clipboard She pulls
a comp card from her bag The Girl flips a page

CHECK-IN GIRL (CONTD)
Just put it with the others

Jesse places her photo on top of a very tall pile

She turns around and sees every set of eyes still fixed on
her They follow her as she finds an empty folding chair in
the corner of the room and sits

The door swings open and every head looks to the NEW GIRL as
she walks in

Jesse slumps down in her seat She pulls a pair of
headphones from her bag and puts them on

MUSIC BLASTS as her thoughts leave the room

JESSES DAYDREAM 32

A series of JUMP CUTS Sun shining through the clouds Bare
feet run on hard concrete A pair of skinny knees drop to
the ground A girl’s hands grip the edge of a swimming pool

We see YOUNG JESSE’s face reflected in the water She looks
at herself for a long time before reaching out a hand and
skimming the surface distorting her face

INT CASTING WAITING ROOM - DAY 33
Jesse peels the nail polish off her fingernails

Every model in the room rises at once A female CASTING
ASSISTANT stands by the door ushering the girls into the
studio Jesse rips off her headphones gathers her things
and follows the line inside

She passes the Check-in Girl still engrossed in her
magazine as she blows an enormous bubble which threatens to

Pop

INT CASTING STUDIO - DAY 34

The studio is very bright Big windows line one side of the
room and racks of clothing line the other

Jesse stands with the group of girls against a side wall
They are positioned shoulder-to-shoulder almost militant
awaiting instruction

In the center of the room the fashion designer SUJI an
elegant Korean woman in her 40s sits at a long table
Standing behind her right shoulder is the TRANSLATOR

The Casting Assistant slams the door hard She places the
stack of comp cards on the Designer’s table and crosses to
the models

ASSISTANT
You can undress

Like clockwork the models strip off their jeans and t-
shirts dropping them in heaps on the ground They stand
tall in their underwear and heels

The Assistant hands each model a paper sheet with a number on
it

The FIRST MODEL is called forward She holds up her number
as the Assistant snaps a Polaroid

The Translator converses for an interminably long time in
Korean pointing to the model’s face and hips clearly
discussing the girl’s features The model tries not to look
nervous Suji remains silent simply shakes her head

TRANSLATOR
Thank you That will be all

The model rejoins the group as another is called forward

Jesse scans the faces behind her wondering how long this
will take She spots an anxious SARAH in the back corner

Another model is dismissed and Suji frowns surveying the
group She locks eyes with Jesse She points

TRANSLATOR (CONTD)
Come forward please

Jesse points to herself

TRANSLATOR (CONTD)
Can you come forward

Jesse walks to the center of the room Suji speaks

TRANSLATOR (CONTD)
She wants to know how old are you

JESSE
Nineteen

The Translator repeats this in Korean Suji puts on her
glasses and examines Jesse suspiciously

JESSE (CONTD)
I just had my birthday

Jesse fidgets

The Assistant stands in front of her and takes a Polaroid
The bright flash startles her

ASSISTANT
Raise your arms

Jesse raises her arms above her head We see that she is
very thin her ribs clearly defined under stretched skin

The Assistant pulls a measuring tape from around her neck and
begins to measure the various circumferences of her body
scribbling notes on a clipboard

She notices the models watching her every move

ASSISTANT (CONTD)
How much do you weigh

JESSE
(distracted)
Sorry

ASSISTANT
Your weight

JESSE
One-oh-two

The Assistant scribbles

ASSISTANT
Can you do the walk

Jesse walks from one side of the room to the other her HEELS
TAPPING a confident rhythm on the hardwood floor Sarah
peers behind another girl to try and get a better look

When she finishes Jesse stands in front of the table A
long silent moment as Suji decides She nods

TRANSLATOR
Very good
INT HALLELEVATOR - DAY 35

An ELEVATOR DING

Jesse’s smiling reflection is torn in two as the elevator
doors part ways She is about to step inside when she hears
a LOUD CRASH She turns toward the noise The crash is
followed by the SOUND OF A WOMAN CRYING

She walks slowly down the hall to investigate

INT RESTROOM DOOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS 36

Jesse presses her ear to the bathroom door which bears the
hot pink icon of a woman’s figure

JESSE
Hello

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Please go away

She pushes the door open

INT WOMEN’S RESTROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 37

Jesse steps inside and sees SARAH’s distorted reflection in
front of a shattered mirror Shards cover the sink and
floor Sarah turns toward Jesse mascara running down her
face red from crying

SARAH
I SAID GET THE FUCK OUT Are you
deaf

JESSE
Sarah

SARAH

Fuck it’s you Perfect

She slides down the bathroom wall and slumps on the ground
The broken mirror crunches under her weight

Jesse notices a few cuts on Sarah’s arm which have already
begun to heal Sarah covers them with her hand

SARAH (CONT’D)
(defensive)
I cut myself when the mirror broke

Someone tries to open the door from the outside Jesse
pushes it shut

JESSE
We’re in here

They try again and Jesse bangs on the opposite side of the
door

JESSE (CONTD)
I said we’re in here

The woman gives up mumbling some profanity Jesse clicks
the lock Sarah is impressed

Jesse sees Sarah’s book under the sink torn apart and picks
up a photo

JESSE (CONTD)
Are you here for a casting

Sarah scoffs

JESSE (CONT’D)
I’m sure you were great

SARAH
I know you saw me

JESSE
Oh

SARAH
Yeah Oh

JESSE

It’s a great photo You look

SARAH
Waste of time Everyone wants you
to look like a fucking preteen

This is pointed Jesse does look like a preteen She kneels
beside Sarah and holds out the book

JESSE
I bet you can fix this

Sarah makes no move to take it

JESSE (CONTD)
They’re expensive

SARAH
Do you know how lucky you are

JESSE
What do you mean

SARAH
Don’t do that

Sarah pulls the box of cigarettes from her purse lights one
and sucks hard

SARAH (CONT’D)
Sometimes I think God has
favorites you know Some people
are just born with more People
look at you They notice I walk
down the street and no one sees me
I’m a ghost

She exhales and a puff of smoke winds up into the air

SARAH (CONTD)
What is that like

JESSE
What

SARAH
To be you To walk into a room and
all of a sudden it’s like - in the
middle of winter you’re the
fucking sun

Jesse swallows

JESSE
(quietly)
It’s everything

Sarah pulls Jesse toward her and puts the cigarette to her
lips Jesse takes a deep inhale coughs

SARAH
Careful

Sarah brushes a piece of hair from Jesse’s face and tucks it
behind her ear She brushes her lips down Jesse’s neck
Jesse closes her eyes full of desire until

JESSE
Shit

She loses her balance and stabs her hand on a piece of
mirror She rushes to the sink and runs the water A large
triangular shard is stuck in her palm She pulls it out
wincing and it clinks in the drain Blood follows

SARAH
Let me see

JESSE
Fuck

SARAH
Let me see

JESSE

It’s really bad

SARAH
Here let me see it

Jesse holds out her hand The fatty muscle is visible
JESSE
Do you think I need stitches I
don’t have insurance
Sarah is staring at the cut
JESSE (CONTD)
(desperately)
What do I do

Sarah impulsively puts Jesse’s hand to her mouth and begins
to suck the blood from the wound Jesse tries to pull away

JESSE (CONT’D)
What the fuck

Sarah sucks hungrily Jesse manages to yank her hand away
Sarah’s mouth is covered in blood

JESSE (CONTD)
What is wrong with you

SARAH
Nothing

JESSE
What the fuck is wrong with you

SARAH

Sarah’s face streams with tears Jesse runs from the

button leaving a streak of blood She looks toward the
bathroom

INT WOMEN’S RESTROOM - DAY 39

across the room
SARAH
Jesse

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - DUSK 46
Jesses reflection in the medicine cabinet is deathly pale

She opens the cabinet and examines the meager contents
toothpaste deodorant a bottle of peroxide She grabs the
peroxide and shuts the cabinet

She opens the bottle and pours a healthy amount over the
wound on her hand now caked in dried blood The wound
bubbles up and the pain is almost unbearable Jesse makes a
sharp sound and sinks to the ground clutching her hand to
her chest

A KNOCK at the door

A LITTLE BELL JINGLES as Dean enters the office door

HANK has his feet up flipping through an out-of-date Hustler
Magazine and shovelling sticky red Chinese food into his
mouth with a fork

INT MOTEL ROOM - DUSK

We ZOOM in slowly on Jesse’s body lying motionless on the
bed She appears to be asleep until we see her eyes open
wide She stares at a patch of wall covered in deep gashes

from the wildcat

IMAGES FLASH through her mind

The wildcat’s yellow eyes

The models looking her up and down

Sarah’s bloody mouth

Suddenly Dean shoves the door open with some force and
stumbles inside He carries a plastic sack from the

drugstore

DEAN
(re the door)

They’1ll fix that soon

Jesse runs to him and wraps her arms around his waist
Surprised by this sudden gesture of intimacy he runs a
gentle hand through her hair curling the soft waterfall of

strands through his fingers

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - DUSK

Jesse sits on the toilet seat knees to her chest like a
child Dean kneels beside her picking a small shard of
mirror from the cut with a pair of tweezers

She winces He hesitates

JESSE
It doesn’t hurt

He dabs a damp piece of tissue around the wound places a
large Band-Aid over the cut and wraps it tightly in an ace

bandage
DEAN
Best I can do
JESSE
Thank you
DEAN

You’re welcome

He thinks about kissing her

but instead

starts to

clean up

Dean tries to start Jesse’s car a run-down Buick past its
prime He has been working at it for some time and sweat
beads cover his brow

Jesse sits on the back bumper watching

Frustrated Dean powers through one last attempt We see the
motor of the car as it springs to life He slams the hood
and wipes his greasy hands

Behind him the sun sets in brilliant red and orange

INT AGENCY OFFICEHALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY 54
The relentless high-pitched RING OF A TELEPHONE

Sitting rigid at a desk is JAN CAMPBELL-COOPER a ferociously
attractive thirty-something sporting a tight-lipped smile and
a power suit with a plunging neckline Every word from her
mouth drips with sing-song saccharine despite her dying
patience

A framed magazine cover bearing a photo of Jan as a model in
her earlier days hangs askew behind the desk

Jesse sits in a shabby upholstered chair pulling at a loose
thread as they wait in silence for the phone to desist

JAN
Cara sweetie would you like to
answer the phone today

Through the door we see Jans twiggy perky blonde
assistant CARA gabbing with the MAIL CLERK unaware of the
phone’s insistence

JAN (CONTD)
(a little too harsh)
CARA

Cara jumps She picks up the receiver

CARA

Jan closes the office door with force

attention lately

plastic straw and scrutinizes Jesse

years

Jesse shrugs

JAN

Rome He kissed me right here

She points to the very corner of her mouth

JAN (CONTD)
What do you think about that

Jan turns to Jesse expectant

JESSE
Wow

Jan turns back to the photo her face reflected in the glass
Jesse attempts to recover

JESSE (CONTD)
You were so beautiful

Jan frowns at the past tense

JAN

overseas How does that sound

JESSE
Sounds amazing

JAN
Cara will have you fill out a W2

simple since you’re over eighteen
Jesse pulls harder at the loose thread in the fabric

JAN (CONTD)
You are eighteen

JESSE
Not exactly

JAN
It says nineteen in your file

JESSE
That might be a mistake

Jan grins knowingly

JAN
Stay right there

She walks out of the office shutting the door behind her

INT AGENCY HALLWAY - DAY 55
Jan marches up to Cara

JAN
I need a parental consent for a
minor International

Cara rummages through her desk which is in total disarray

Jan looks over at three other HOPEFUL MODELS sitting in a row
of chairs She shoots them a half smile She speaks to Cara
through clenched teeth

JAN (CONTD)
I thought I told you to keep the
others in reception

CARA
I thought this would be better

JAN
Oh you thought it would be better

CARA
(confused)
That’s what I just said

Jan rips the paperwork out of Cara’s hand and storms back
into the office

INT AGENCY OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 56
Jan hands a stack of forms to Jesse

JAN
Here we go

JESSE
What’s this

JAN
All we need is a signature giving
parental consent Just one little
signature right there and off you

Jesse takes the papers looking closely at the line reading
‘Parent or Guardian”

JAN (CONTD)
Is that a problem

Jesse shakes her head

JAN (CONTD)
Good Now we need to work on your
book before you go so I’ve
arranged for a test shoot It’s
thirteen-hundred which I know
sounds astronomical but again
well cover it A small price to
pay for all the work you’ll get

in the business Real Jackson-
Pollock-meets-Marlon-Brando type
And his photos are good too So
my advice is Don’t mess it up

She hands Jesse a slip of paper with an address
JAN (CONTD)
You can meet him at one

Elevator doors close shut behind a frozen Jesse On the
other side of the studio is JACK A silent moment passes

between them Jesse is acutely aware that they are alone

JACK
Come closer

Jesse walks to him

JACK (CONTD)
Take off your clothes

She looks around for a place to change The studio is
modest minimal clean Brick walls and large windows
Various lighting instruments and a small desk in the corner

JACK (CONTD)
Something wrong

JESSE
No

She tosses her bag on the ground and strips to her underwear
She stands tall awaiting instruction

JACK
All the way

Jesse swallows hard She slips her underwear down her legs
brushing them to the side with a foot She unhooks her bra
and drops it to the ground

He stares at her for a long time It is not sexual rather
the look of a sculptor sizing up an untouched ivory block

JACK (CONTD)
Pull your hair up and turn

She does

The idea comes to him He walks out of the room and Jesse
is left alone Shivering she attempts to cover her body
with her arms The rays of sunlight shooting through the
window shine down on her like a spotlight

He returns carrying a large metal box and a bundled plastic
tarp He stretches the tarp out in the corner of the room
smoothing every corner with great care and deliberation

He motions for Jesse to come

He opens the box and examines the contents making his
selection Curious Jesse tries to peer inside

JACK (CONTD)
Put this on

He tosses the object to her She drops it nervous and
bends down to pick it up before he notices It is a tube of
gold paint

Jack cleans a lens with a small cloth and attaches it to the
camera base on a tripod

JESSE
Um -

She looks at the tube unsure of what to do

JESSE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry -

He either doesn’t hear her or doesn’t care to respond

JESSE (CONTD)
I don’t know what to do with this

He goes to her and takes the tube

JESSE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry

He squeezes a good amount of paint on his hand He stands
behind her placing a hand at her collarbone

A SERIES OF JUMP CUTS He slides his hand across her chest
Between her breasts Down the soft flesh of her belly

JESSES POV Jack stands back and admires his work wiping
his hands

JACK
Over there

He motions for her to stand in front of the camera He
clicks a small remote and MUSIC begins to play through the
studio

We only see Jack as he stands behind a camera and begins to
take pictures He stops looks up unhappy He walks out of
frame to adjust something then back to the camera

JACK (CONTD)
You look stiff

JESSE (0S)
How’s this

JACK
Better

He clicks a few more photos He takes the camera off the
tripod and walks closer the CLICKS OF THE CAMERA growing
rapid and regular louder and louder

a buck each I never got caught

JESSE

RUBY
Look the point is sometimes you
have to do something a little bit
bad to get something really really
good And usually no one ever

sign-sign’ Jesse scribbles the signature Ruby tosses
tissues into the air like confetti a celebration

Yeah

CONRAD
What kind of fish do you have

JESSE
Um a red one

Jesse looks as sheepish as possible Conrad thinks she’s
adorable

JESSE (CONT’D)
Can I come back and take a look

He motions her behind the counter As they turn away from
the door Ruby slips inside and disappears to the back

CONRAD
So these are flakes and these are
pellets Really they’re the same

want to spend This is fourteen-
ninety-nine but it’ll last you a

produces a large orange and yellow cockatiel

JESSE (CONTD)

RUBY
They wouldn’t sell him to me

JESSE
Why not

She runs a finger down his back

RUBY

Ruby’s living room is a bona fide zoo A giant cage holds at
least thirty restless parakeets flapping and CHIRPING
incessantly An upset deck of tarot cards is strewn across
the coffee table On the wall a framed quote “The light is
mine Its rays consume me”

Jesse scans a shelf running her fingers across a row of
books including The Holy Book of Thelema and Magic and
Alchemy She selects a thick leatherbound book opening to
a page covered in Latin scrawl and a reverse Pentagram
Ruby reappears with the cockatiel in a small cage
RUBY
I should name him Conrad What do

Jesse looks up from the book

JESSE

Do you believe in it This
magic stuff

Some of it

Jesse flips a page Ruby watches her intently

Jesse shrugs

RUBY (CONTD)
Everyone believes in something

Jesse flips the page to images documenting various animal
sacrifice rituals She glances nervously at the birdcage

JESSE
Why wouldn’t they sell you the
bird

Because they’re a bunch of
Fascists

Ruby grabs the book and puts it back on the shelf

paying attention Jack clocks him Dean tumbles backwards
and trips over a rack of women’s clothing The whole thing
topples over

EXT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 82

The feet stop in front of Jesse’s door

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 83

The door slowly opens The feet creep to Jesse’s bedside
Fingers rub greedily against sweaty palms We see that they
belong to HANK He looks down on Jesse sleeping quietly
his expression full of longing

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the switchblade
Opens it He sticks the blade between her slightly open
lips Between her teeth Down into the soft hollow of her
mouth

Jesse wakes She sees the knife and freezes fearful of
slicing her tongue on the blade She locks eyes with HANK
who is panting hard

HANK
Wider

After a beat Jesse opens her mouth wider

HANK (CONTD)
WIDER

She opens wider still the skin of her mouth stretched taut
at the corners He sticks the blade down into her throat
She begins to gag

Jesse sits upright in bed She flips on the light and looks

around the room for Hank but she is alone She holds a hand
to her mouth realizing it was all a dream

Cool water runs in the sink as Jesse splashes her face She
has not removed her make-up and it is smudged across her
face

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 86

Jesse lies back on the bed and curls into the fetal position
She picks up her phone from the nightstand and sees that she
has two missed calls She ignores them and clicks the light
off again

While attempting to drift back to sleep the SOUND OF
FOOTSTEPS startles her A man’s shadow looms outside her
window She rushes to do the chain-lock backing into the
dark corner She watches the shadow pass under her door to
the neighboring room

Jesse puts an ear to the wall The faint whispers of a YOUNG
GIRL’S VOICE startled by the unexpected company Her eyes
widen as the whispers become FEARFUL CRIES Some awful
violence is taking place in the room next door
CUT TO Behind the wall Jesse is silhouetted as the CAMERA
TRACKS BACKWARD creating a tunnel effect

Wrapped in a white towel she draws the large outline of a
heart with her finger on the foggy mirror in front of her
She stares at the heart before wiping it away revealing her
image

For the first time we see her without any make-up or
glamour She looks incredibly young a girl of sixteen

INT HILLS HOUSE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT 90

The room is luxurious clean comfortable - the complete
opposite of Jerry’s Motel She towel-dries her hair as she

cover her nude body with the towel

RUBY

She holds up a small bottle

JESSE

She points to Jesse’s hand

Helps it heal

Jesse sits on the bed Ruby carefully unwinds the bandage
and doctor’s her injured hand

RUBY (CONTD)

JESSE
Thank you

Ruby looks down at her exposed body

RUBY

Jesse swallows hard Ruby touches her ankle up her leg
over her knee to the inside of her thigh

scrunches into a tight ball a mix of pain and pleasure

is slightly too large and she looks very much like she is

A SHARP SCREAM

A YOUNG WOMAN is being chased around the neighboring
backyard A YOUNG MAN catches her and throws her over his
shoulder upside down The young woman squeals with delight

Jesse frowns She turns away

She walks to the edge of the diving board and jumps high in
the air The sound of the DIVING BOARD SPRINGS

Mid-air she twists and lands back on the board clinging to
it with both arms struggling to maintain her balance

She looks with horror at the concrete bottom of the pool
which holds no water only two large round drains

RUBY
Did you go swimming

JESSE

Jesse laughs hysterically teetering on the edge of drunk

RUBY
What’s so funny

Jesse’s laughter fades to nothing She is very still
contemplative

JESSE
When I was eleven I asked my
mother for a swimming pool I
begged and begged Please let me
have a swimming pool Please Of
course she said no But my
Stepdad he said ‘You want a
swimming pool you got a swimming
pool’ Two months later -

She snaps her fingers

JESSE (CONTD)
My mother told me I was dangerous

JESSE
She was right She wasn’t wrong

I supposed to feel bad Sometimes
I look at myself and I think I
actually think - God Was there

mean look at me What else is
there

She takes a drink

has been ripped out

A very YOUNG MODEL in a robe enters from the make-up room
Her hair and make-up are elaborately constructed She stands
in front of Jack

wearing very little underneath

The wind whips sand in the air The sun has disappeared and
the beach is misty gloomy ready for rain

The rhythmic SOUND OF THE TENT grows stronger stronger
It is a full heartbeat now

Gigi is pulled to the water drawn by some magnetic force
The HEARTBEAT grows louder

Gigi wades into the water up to her knees She looks down
searching for something Gentle blue waves lap around her

She stares at her reflection in the water She reaches down
and touches it lovingly

Suddenly the reflection transforms into JESSE’S FACE A

Bright light flashes across her face every time Jack snaps a
photo Her patience is diminishing at a rapid rate

Jack signals to the Model with his hand indicating that they
are done She high-fives him and heads back into the make-up

room

Sarah sits up hopeful Then

The elevator opens and a dozen new MODELS walk out chatting
noisily A few of them wave to Jack as they make their way
to the make-up room

her jaw

around anticipating an apology but the Brunette Model
continues laughing and chatting with her friends unaware

SARAH
Excuse me

The Model turns around

She looks fully at her reflection and screams hysterically

INT DOCTOR’S WAITING ROOM - DAY 161

Gigi is damp and covered in sand Mascara is smeared beneath
her eyes She is arguing with the RECEPTIONIST a
conversation which has gone on for some time

RECEPTIONIST
I’ve already told you -

GIGI
Yes but I’ve been waiting for an
hour

RECEPTIONIST
Like I said before ma’am you
don’t have an appointment

GIGI
(an insult)
Are you new

RECEPTIONIST
There’s no need for that tone

GIGI
Please tell him I’m here

Gigi slumps back into a chair She puts her head in her
hands

A woman exits through the door beside reception Gigi sees
her chance and runs through it

RECEPTIONIST
Excuse me Excuse me what are you
doing
INT DOCTORS HALLWAYPATIENT ROOM - DAY 162

Bright white doors to various patient rooms line the hallway
Gigi flings them all open searching desperately for
something

She opens the door to one room and a naked woman turns
around Hideous black tick marks cover her body prepped for
surgery

Gigi back away She slams into a doctor in a handsome tie
standing in the doorway It is DR ANDREW 43 charming
perfect smile The fluorescent light from the hallway shines
down on him and he looks like an angel

Gigi throws her arms around his waist He brushes some sand
from her hair

DR ANDREW
Were you building a sandcastle

The Receptionist rounds the corner in hot pursuit

RECEPTIONIST
I’m sorry - I tried to stop her

DR ANDREW
Annie -

RECEPTIONIST
(annoyed)
It’s Anna

DR ANDREW
Anna please find a room This is
my best patient

Gigi beams at him

INT PATIENT ROOM - DUSK 163

The room is almost luxurious Gigi sits on a table in a robe
while Dr Andrew presses the skin around her nose

DR ANDREW
It’s healing nicely Looks good
Open up

Gigi opens her robe and Dr Andrew feels her breasts For
the first time we see small scars from her implants

DR ANDREW (CONTD)
Does this hurt

Gigi shakes her head

DR ANDREW (CONTD)
And I gave you a prescription for
Vicodin just in case

GIGI
And Xanax

DR ANDREW
Turn for me

Gigi turns to the side

DR ANDREW (CONTD)
Everything looks fine You’re good
to go

He snaps off a pair of rubber gloves and tosses them in a big
metal can

GIGI
Please - I need you to do
something
Dr Andrew sighs
DR ANDREW

I told you kiddo four in one year
is all I’1ll do If you want to
talk about a fifth this soon you’1l
have to wait or go find somebody
else but I cannot give you my
blessing Your body can’t go
through that kind of trauma -

GIGI
I need you to take it out

DR ANDREW
Take what out

GIGI
All of it

Gigi begins to cry Dr Andrew pats her hand gently He
sits beside her and she melts into him

GIGI (CONTD)
I did something I think - I can
feel it inside me I need you to
take it out okay Can you just -
can you just take it out Please
Please I can’t go home I can’t
leave until you do

DR ANDREW
Hey hey It’s okay Look it
isn’t uncommon After something
like this You’ve put a foreign
object into your body Plenty of
women feel this way Plenty of
women experience some sadness
discomfort even depression We
talked about all of this remember

Gigi nods

DR ANDREW (CONTD)
Youll be fine If you want a mild
anti-depressant call me and we can
figure it out okay

He starts to leave but she clutches his hand so desperately
that one of her nails breaks his skin

DR ANDREW (CONT’D)
Ow Jesus

He looks at her frightened and concerned
DR ANDREW (CONTD)
Wait right here Okay Don’t go

anywhere

Dr Andrew leaves Gigi gasps for breath half smiles
simultaneously relieved and at a loss

She sees Dr Andrew whispering to a NURSE in the hall The
Nurse peers in the room furrows her brow

Gigi backs away from the door realizing he is not going to
help her She looks around the room desperate What to do
now

She sees her reflection in a metal cabinet walks up to it
Touches it

GIGI
(whispers )
Jesse

Suddenly the outrageously loud BEAT OF A HEART Gigi covers
her ears as though someone had blasted music through
headphones

She stumbles around the room throwing drawers open She
spots something in one reaches in

Dr Andrew enters the room Gigi’s back is to him as he
steps inside

DR ANDREW
Gigi Honey Someone is on their
way over here to talk to you okay
Help you out Okay Kiddo Can
you hear me

Gigi turns to face him She is holding a scalpel

DR ANDREW (CONTD)
What are you doing

Gigi slices across both of her breasts Blood and silicone
ooze from the wounds

DR ANDREW (CONTD)
Jesus Christ

She jams the scalpel into her stomach She pulls the scalpel
down cutting across her belly Blood everywhere She cries
from the pain brought to her knees Her flesh rips open as
she makes one last cut and drops the scalpel on the ground
She plunges a hand inside of her searching for something

Dr Andrew runs from the room
She pulls her hand from her stomach It is covered in blood

empty She looks at the blood pooling around her knees and
realizes what she has done

164 INT STUDIO BATHROOM - DAY - LATER 164

Sarah sits in the corner of the bathroom knees pulled to her
chest Her face is red and hot from crying but now she is
still calm

A NOISE from the opposite side of the door draws her
attention up The door opens and light from the make-up
room pours in

Jack appears in the doorway

JACK
How long have you been in here

Sarah shrugs

He looks down at her his expression pitiful He sits on the
floor in front of her She smiles a little at this
unexpected gesture of kindness

JACK (CONTD)
You have to stop this

SARAH
Stop what

JACK
This Coming around all the time
Showing up wherever I am

SARAH
I thought you’d be happy to see me

She places a hand on his knee

He sighs He puts his hand on hers and pats it lovingly
before removing it

SARAH (CONTD)
(confused)
We slept together

JACK
Three years ago

SARAH
You make it sound like I’m crazy

JACK
Well -

Jack holds two fingers close together as if to say ‘just a
little crazy’

Sarah smiles at this They share a small laugh Her
laughter ceases as a wave of realization passes over her

face

SARAH
You’re never going to love me

He does not respond

SARAH (CONT’D)
Are you

JACK
Sarah -

SARAH
Why Why won’t you love me

He looks to the ground does not respond
We ZOOM IN slowly on her face as she speaks

SARAH (CONT’D)
(a realization)
I thought I could make you love me
I thought - But it’s too hard All
of it All of it Be young Be
thin Be perfect It’s too hard
(pointed)
You have no idea what I’ve done
All for you It was all for you

JACK (0S)
What did you do

The camera stops Time seems to stand still

SARAH
I ate a young virgin because I
thought it would make me beautiful

Jack freezes his mouth gaping For a minute he thinks she
must be serious Then his mouth begins to curl into a smile
He starts to laugh

SARAH (CONT’D)
I’m serious It’s not a joke

He laughs harder

JACK
What’s with you today

SARAH
What do you mean

JACK
I don’t know Something’s -

SARAH
What

JACK
Different

He looks at her for a long time He smiles

JACK (CONTD)
Okay

He holds up one finger

JACK (CONTD)
One drink One

Sarah can hardly believe it She holds up one finger to
match his

SARAH
One

JACK
Just one

SARAH

Ill meet you after work We can
go wherever you want

JACK
Okay

SARAH
Just one I swear

He starts to leave changes his mind

JACK
You do have beautiful eyes

He goes

Sarah is very still for a moment She tries to control her
breathing but she is overcome She holds a hand to her
heart and closes her eyes Fat tears roll down her face
She weeps convulsing for a very long time Deep sharp
exhales Years of longing met in a moment

She is suddenly still A look of disbelief crosses her face
Did she really get away with it Did it really work
She scrambles off the floor and looks into the mirror
Tentative at first she wipes away the tears and takes a
moment to truly examines her face turning this way and that
She searches for some change

Her hands rise to her eyes Her beautiful eyes

IMAGES FLASH through her mind Jesse’s eye on the bathroom
floor Her hand picking it up Putting it in her mouth

A smile creeps across her face It worked

She begins to laugh Wild manic laughter escapes her lips
She is the portrait of a deranged lunatic

She stretches top and bottom eyelids away from her eyes with
her thumb and forefinger Her mouth opens wide Her eyes
bulge out She appears utterly grotesque

We slowly ZOOM IN on her eyes growing wider and wider her
laughter growing louder and louder until finally

It stops
