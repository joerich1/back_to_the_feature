VOICE (OVER)
Hello hello hello is there anybody
out there

FADE IN

EXT MAIN STREET - DEVAR-TOI - END-WORLD - DAY

A small town like any other Finely tailored lawns Handsome
colonial houses Adults under porch shade sit sip tall ice
filled glasses of lemonade KIDS ride bikes play freeze tag
bounce big red rubber balls between them

The only odd thing here all the children wear small badges
like radiation monitors each lit to varying levels of red

A kick goes wide and the ball lands caught in mid-air by two
strong hands

TILT UP

A MAN DRESSED ALL IN BLACK Handsome Eyes you might mistake
for kind instead of entirely empty

BOY
(smiling)
Thanks Mr O’Dim

The Man In Black ruffles the child’s hair those pale eyes
untouched by even his own smile as (OVER) A BELL RINGS

Kids stop their playing and look up The adults stand now
too coming off the porches falling into step with the

children all heading towards a high steeple at the town’s
center

EXT LIBRARY - DEVAR-TOI - HIGH ANGLE

The children queue into the old and steepled town library

INT LIBRARY - DEVAR-TOI - NIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS

Children are strapped into chairs by their adult minders IVs
slipped into implanted ports on small arms

An aging high tech serum pump snakes thin mottled tubes into
the children’s IVs

Something is wrong with the adults faces they appear slack
ill-fitting almost like masks

On the CHILDREN’S FACES as they all SHUT THEIR EYES The IV
PUMP begins CHUGGING an awful LOW-TECH NOISE HARDER
spitting milky fluid into the IVs as the Man In Black walks
the floor among them nodding as if supervising

MAN IN BLACK
Good children

The PUMP increases in speed The children appear focused
behind closed eyes CONCENTRATING and

OBJECTS in the room begin to rise slightly off the floor
when --

The children’s EYES SNAP OPEN HEADS GOES BACK WHITE ENERGY
STREAMING FROM SCREAMING MOUTHS AND EYES

The Man in Black turns turns as if he’s facing us And God
help all that is innocent or good he smiles

CUT TO

A BOY - CLOSE
Sits up in bed Eyes wide Mouth barely stifling a SCREAM

WIDER

INT BEDROOM - NEW YORK CITY - PRESENT DAY - DAWN

A terrified JAKE CHAMBERS dark hair sharp eyes takes
a moment breathing away the nightmare

He climbs out of bed and goes to the window past dozens of
PENCIL SKETCHES taped to the wall a familiar Man in Black a
single rose men with ill fitting faces children with light
shooting out of their eyes their mouths

EXT NEW YORK CITY - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAWN

The morning sun stains the familiar silver spires a crimson
hue Jake’s face is small in one of the endless windows As
he stares out at the sweeping dawn we HEAR his voice

JAKE (VO)
There are other worlds than this

INT PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - UPPER WEST SIDE - MORNING

Modern Affluent Jake sits on the couch It’s hard not to
notice the deep circles under the boy’s eyes
JAKE
And what happens in one happens in all
the other worlds too Only
differently Like

Sitting across from Jake is a silver-haired PSYCHIATRIST
He is flipping through Jake’s latest DRAWINGS

JAKE (CONTD)
Like

(searching)
echoes

The psychiatrist lingers on a drawing a tall DARK TOWER
rising from a vast field of red roses

He sets down the sketch book looks up at Jake The clinical
appraisal in his eyes doesn’t hide his concern

PSYCHIATRIST
Tell me about the earthquakes

JAKE
I told you already--

PSYCHIATRIST
Tell me again

Jake stares

JAKE
I think the earthquakes are the beams
starting to fall

PSYCHIATRIST
The beams that hold up the tower that
holds up the universe

JAKE
I know how it sounds

Hates how this sounds

PSYCHIATRIST
And the doorways

JAKE
Please John

PSYCHIATRIST
The doorways Jake
JAKE
The doorways are how you cross from one
world to another

PSYCHIATRIST
I don’t see them

JAKE
Because they’re hidden So not just
anyone can find them

PSYCHIATRIST
But you can

JAKE
I don’t know Yes Maybe

PSYCHIATRIST
But you’ve said before the doorways are
protected by guards

JAKE
Not guards
PSYCHIATRIST
Go on
JAKE
Demons

The psychiatrist scribbles on his pad

PSYCHIATRIST
Aren’t you afraid
JAKE
(of course)
Yes But I think I’m supposed to do
this
PSYCHIATRIST

Youre supposed to cross over to
another world Supposed to help save
the universe

JAKE
What if it’s not made up What if it’s
not like you’re making it sound

PSYCHIATRIST
How am I making it sound How does it
sound to you

Jake glances away not wanting to answer The doctor looks at
the anguished boy with empathetic eyes

PSYCHIATRIST (CONT’D)
Let’s talk a little about your father

JAKE
This isn’t about that

PSYCHIATRIST
What happened to your father Jake

The moment lasts finally Jake speaks

JAKE
He died

PSYCHIATRIST
How

Jake looks away hating this

PSYCHIATRIST (CONT’D)
How did your father die Jake

Jake is fighting back the tears

JAKE
Everything in my life can’t be about
that

PSYCHIATRIST

But this is entirely about that You
lost your father Your world has been
collapsing ever since So youve
created a fantasy in which you alone
can hold the world no the entire
universe together

Jake looks away It takes all he has not to cry

JAKE
It’s doesn’t feel like a fantasy --

PSYCHIATRIST
Bad things happen Sad yes Awful
sometimes But they’re random

He reaches out and touches Jake’s hand

PSYCHIATRIST (CONT’D)
So sometimes faced with the
senselessness of life our mind makes
up stories to help us feel in control
(MORE )
PSYCHIATRIST (CONT’D)
But they’re just that Jake stories
Stories that can feel terribly real

Jakes eyes are welling with tears

PSYCHIATRIST (CONT’D)
Let’s try something Your head is
throwing a lot of bad guys at you
(hands back Jake’s sketch
pad)
How about you draw some good guys see
how that feels

Jake looks at him

JAKE
I don’t want to be
PSYCHIATRIST
I’m sorry
JAKE

I just don’t want to be crazy

EXT AMSTERDAM AVENUE - NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

Halloween decorations in store windows Dervishes of leaves
whip the curbs Jake walks head bowed Arrives at a bus
stop

INT MTA CITY BUS - DAY

Jake sits alone amidst morning rush hour Folks watch their
phones read copies of The Post with the headline MORE
EARTHQUAKES ROCK MIDTOWN

The city slows down outside the window as the bus pulls to a
stop in the low 70’s A PASSENGERS REFLECTION in the window
the man rubs his head and his face adjusts as if ill
fitting

Jake’s eyes SNAP to the man as the side doors open and the
man follows a teenage girl off the bus now looking perfectly
normal Was it just his imagination

The bus starts moving again But now Jake’s heart is racing
in his chest He looks down at his sketch pad in his lap

He takes a few deep breaths trying to contain his panic
JAKE

(small)
Draw some good guys
He flips to a new page Hasty lines begin to form as he
DRAWS a face takes shape Weathered yet handsome Jake
intently draws

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MID-WORLD - DAY

The sound of the bus has become the steady CLIP-CLOP of a
CHESTNUT HORSE traversing rugged rocky terrain A FIGURE on
its back silhouetted against the falling blood red sun

The MAN carries a satchel bearing some sort of faded crest
He wears dusty road leathers mixed with chain-mail cobbled
together over countless years face hidden in the brim shadow
of his old leather hat

He draws his horse to a stop atop the crest of a RIDGE
Removes his hat and rubs sweat from his forehead as he gazes
down at the ONE ROAD TOWN far below And we get our first
good look at him

He is ageless and rugged But his handsome features have been
worn down by time like the dog-eared pages of a book Once
brilliant sky blue eyes that have lost all passion replaced
by a weary doggedness

His name is ROLAND DESCHAIN And he is inarguably the man
from Jake’s drawing

Roland replaces his hat and spurs his horse which starts
reluctantly down the rocks

VOICE (OVER)
(singing Pink Floyd)
Okay okay okay is there anybody out
there

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

We are looking into a BLACK SPHERE about the size of a
bowling ball The ball -- BLACK 13 -- HUMS like a swarm of
angry bees the image within is the cowboy from Jake’s

drawing riding horseback

WIDER TO REVEAL

INT LIBRARY - DEVAR-TOI - NIGHT

The MAN IN BLACK stands in the now empty library gazing
into the cue ball-sized crystal
MAN IN BLACK
(darkening)
Well hello you And today of all days

Annoyance in his TONE but also something else Respect He
returns Black 13 to an ornately carved GHOSTWOOD BOX

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
So be it old chum One last time
around the mulberry bush
(singing)
There is no moon upon the horizon My
hands felt just like two balloons

The lone figure on horseback is still visible within the
enchanted sphere as the box CLAPS LOUDLY SHUT to BLACK --

EXT TULL - MID-WORLD - DUSK

CLOSE BLACK BOOTS walk over dusty ground Tiny dirt
tornadoes swirl in their wake Unnatural

WIDER

The Man in Black now strides down the dusty main street of
this dusty town Tombstone by way of Camelot by way of The
Last Picture Show Squat wooden buildings some with
parapets Telephone poles sport broadcast hubs instead of
wires

The Man heads towards one building in particular A faded
sign hangs CREAKING and swinging above the door “Olaf
Shillestad Cabinets Upholstering and Undertaking

INT UNDERTAKER’S - TULL - DUSK

THE UNDERTAKER (50s) HAMMERS a nail working by candlelight
as he builds a wooden coffin On his table lays a corpse once
named NORT (30s but the ravaged face of a 90-year old)

As the door beyond him swings open the Undertaker misses the
nail and strikes his thumb He mutters a CURSE as he turns to
face the Man in Black who smiles

MAN IN BLACK
Sorry Didn’t mean to startle you

UNDERTAKER
Help you

The Man in Black walks inside eyeing the corpse He takes a
deep inhale through his nose the dead body his snifter
MAN IN BLACK
Devil weed Never had a taste for the
hard stuff myself

He looks up at the Undertaker his colorless eyes glinting in
the candlelight as he gestures to a silver cross on the wall

MAN IN BLACK (CONT’D)
Though you’re taking quite a risk with
your man upstairs are you not

The Undertaker frowns not quite understanding The Man in
Black indicates the deceased

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
OD If it’s a sin to kill yourself
wouldn’t your God consider it a sin to
help one such as this cross over

UNDERTAKER
I take it you do not accept His glory

MAN IN BLACK
The newer gods are more to my taste

The Undertaker’s eyes narrow with understanding

UNDERTAKER
The Crimson King is no god

MAN IN BLACK
He’s going to cleanse the universe
remake it in his image populate it
with his denizens and rule over it for
all eternity

He smiles

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
Sounds pretty god-like to me

UNDERTAKER
You have a name mister

But his gaze is not as welcoming by half as his words The
Man in Black ignores the question as he walks around the
body now stroking dead Nort’s mane of unkempt hair

The Undertaker’s distaste doesn’t prevent him from using the
opportunity to edge toward a GUN sitting on a side table

MAN IN BLACK
A man in your profession you must have
given a lot of thought to death

(MORE)

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
Of lives well lived and heavenly
rewards Of sinners and well their
opposite

The Undertaker reaches the table reaches for his gun

MAN IN BLACK (CONT’D)
Do our actions really matter Does all
this end in death Is there an after

Without looking up The Man in Black raises a finger and the
gun SLIDES AWAY from the man’s grasp falls off the table
Magic The Undertaker’s gaze SNAPS UP

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
What if I could give you proof

The Man in Black looks back at him

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
What if I could bring our friend here
back so he can tell you for himself
what it’s like beyond this mortal veil
Would you like that

His eyes are magnetic drawing in the Undertaker’s gaze

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
I could do that But not without
cost Would you invite me into your
heart for such a glimpse You would
have to do so willingly

The older man’s fear giving way to something else now Awe
perhaps

OLAF
W-who are you

MAN IN BLACK
I go by many names Death Flagg The
Walking Dude
(casual)
But hey call me Walter

And so from henceforth that’s what we’ll do

Walter handsprings over the body Then back the other way
He repeats the action quicker and again quicker still

He’s like a black silverfish dancing back and forth over the
body in a motion that is both not human and disturbing in
the way of car wrecks and misborn animals

Then suddenly he has stopped is standing stock still beside
the corpse Nort sits up eyes wide

UNDERTAKER
-N-nort

But something’s not right Nort’s mouth is slack and drool
spills from his lips His eyes are the same colorless hue as
Walters

NORT
Hubba-hhba-whoo

OLAF
(horrified)
W-what’s-- what’s wrong with him

Walter’s eyes twinkle A man with a plan
WALTER

I said he’d come back I never said
he’d come back the same

EXT TULL - MID-WORLD - DUSK

PAN DOWN from a shattered wooden post sign (TULL) which
launches a single crow to find Roland as he approaches the
edge of main street

INT KENNERLY’S LIVERY STABLE - DUSK

Roland rides his horse through the open stable doors A
robotic baler hi-tech by our standards but seemingly a
century old here struggles A MAN works alongside the
failing robot in the deep shadow pitching hay

Roland rides his horse through the open stable doors A MAN
works in the deep shadow pitching hay

ROLAND
Hey

MAN
Hey yourself

ROLAND
Horse here I’m looking to put up

The man stabs his pitchfork into the hay KENNERLY 30s

KENNERLY
Good for you How long

ROLAND
Night maybe two

As he approaches Kennerly assesses Roland Notes the
ornately painted HORN OF ELD slung around his waist
Kennerly tries to hide the sudden greed in his eyes

KENNERLY
You looking for charity you come to
the wrong place But I’1ll do ya an
exchange for that horn ya got there

Roland simply pulls a GOLD COIN out of his pocket flips it
to Kennerly as he dismounts Kennerly REACTS as he eyes the
coin Bites it to make sure it’s real His eyes NARROW

KENNERLY (CONT’D)
Man’s riding a threaded horse what
ain’t got two heads or six eyes
tossing around gold coins You got
yourself a name Mister

But Roland just walks out into the darkening sky As Kennerly
watches him go

EXT TULL - DUSK

Roland walks down the middle of main street Past a hi tech
automobile APPLE and TESLA logos still visible half buried
in blown sand all usable parts long ago stripped

A Boy tosses a stick to a mangy dog An Old Woman knits on
her porch humming along to faint PIANO MUSIC that drifts
from a SALOON ahead “Hey Jude”

The setting sun casts long shadows as Roland passes a CHURCH
Fresh whitewash not quite hiding graffiti of a single CRIMSON
EYE

PRIEST (OVER)
My brothers and sisters in Christ the
subject of our meditation tonight is
The Interloper

INT CHURCH - DUSK
CLOSE A match ignites a tall candle
PRIESTESS (OVER)

The Interloper who looms with his face
in the shadow

A WOMAN PRIESTESS stands at the altar lighting candles that
surround a crucifix

PRIESTESS (CONTD)
The Interloper whose poison fingers
handed Eve the rotted apple Who took
our Lord up the mountain and showed him
all the world’s pleasures Who smiled
when Jesus Christ had his moment of
doubt and pain

The wooden pews are half full with TOWNSPEOPLE

PRIESTESS (CONTD)
Who among you fears the Interloper
(looks from face to face)
Who among you has the strength to
resist him To fight the Dark Days that
surround us

A Congregant answers in a hesitant VOICE

CONGREGANT
I do

PRIESTESS
(nods “good for you”)
Who else Who among you will resist his
efforts to drag your soul into the muck
and mire of Hell

And now a few others join in “I DO”

The candles on the altar FLICKER as the church doors open and
someone slips into a back pew

PRIESTESS (OVER) (CONTD)
Lucifer Satan Beelzebub Abaddon --

Suddenly her voice falters as her eyes land on the
newcomer The Man in Black

PRIESTESS (CONTD)
he goes by many names

Something about him makes her blood run cold Walter nods a
small grin on his lips “Please go on”

PRIESTESS (CONTD)
and it’s he who will return to
usher Last Times unto the world

She looks back to her Congregants regains her footing

PRIESTESS (CONTD)
When he comes to you-- when the devil
shows his face will you renounce him

CONGREGATION
Yes
PRIESTESS
Will you renounce the Interloper
CONGREGATION MAN IN BLACK
Yes (under his breath)

Praise the Lord

INT SALOON - DUSK

Sawdust on the floor Townies drinking hunched over the bar
or playing Watch Me at the tipsy-legged tables Some others
by the piano SINGING along to the wheezy rendition of “Hey
Jude” The batwing doors swing OPEN and Roland enters

The patrons take subtle notice of him as he sits at the bar

ROLAND
Steak Whiskey

The bartender ALICE (30s) gives him a bemused smile

ALICE
How’s a hamburger and a beer

The light falls on a nasty scar across her cheek She was
pretty once maybe even beautiful Now just sad eyes

Roland nods Puts a gold coin on the bar

ALICE (CONTD)
Ain’t got change for that

ROLAND
Don’t expect any

Alice sets a bottle and mug down Moves off to get the food
Roland pours the beer Indifferent to the suddenly charged
atmosphere in the room the sidelong glances of the townies
the card game slowing down

And the approaching MAN who pulls a KNIFE
Without looking at the man Roland opens his duster to reveal

a GUN hanging from a holster Seeing it the man stops in his
tracks

ROLAND (CONTD)
Pass the salt

Roland looks up and meets the man’s stare Eye-lock Then the
man SPITS onto the floor saving face and turns away

Alice has noticed the gun too her eyes linger on the worn
sandalwood grip as she sets the hamburger down

She passes Roland the salt as the Piano Player closes the
piano lid and heads out followed by most of the patrons
Only a few drunks remain

ROLAND (CONTD)
Friendly place

ALICE
Long days since anyone’s seen an
unfamiliar face ‘round here You’re the
second stranger pass through this week

We see that news land on Roland

ALICE (CONTD)
People ‘round here are superstitious

Spook easy
ROLAND
Boo
Alice smiles
ALICE

Guess they’re wondering if youre an
omen that the world’s about to move on

again
ROLAND
I’m hardly that important
ACROSS THE ROOM -- The batwing doors open and a man slips
in NORT the recently resurrected corpse

He notices Roland at the bar and something ticks across his
rheumy eyes (which have returned to normal) Something

IMPORTANT A memory But one just out of his grasp
AT THE BAR -- Roland takes a bite of his burger Disgusting

but he expected that Asks

ROLAND (CONTD)
This other stranger Happen to be
dressed all in black

ALICE
You mean like a preacher-man

ROLAND
(nothing like that)
Something like that

ALICE
I didn’t see him myself Just heard
people talking

Roland nods as if this is always the way as if he has been
chasing the man he seeks for a very long time

ROLAND
They say which way he went

ALICE
Maybe

She meets his eyes

ALICE (CONTD)
But information like that has a price

Roland reaches for his money pouch but she puts her hand on
his stopping him

ALICE (CONT’D)
I don’t want any more of your money

He looks down at her hand on his then back up to her eyes
A desperate needy look there

ALICE (CONTD)
Youre easy to look at You don’t seem
nice or nothing But maybe kind Or
maybe I just been alone too long and
youll deer gut me in my sleep

She shrugs still holds his eyes
ALICE (CONTD)
We can turn out the lights if I’m too
ugly
HOLD on Roland returning her stare impassive

INT ALICE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Moonlight silhouettes entwined bodies They’re in her bed in
her small bedroom above the saloon

Their movements are awkward raw An act of release more than
of connection As Alice moans and Roland grunts

ROLAND
Susan

ALICE
What

He says nothing

ALICE (CONTD)
Alice

She looks away
AFTERWARDS Roland stands at the window gazing up into the
night As if he’s looking for something up there among the

twinkling orbs

Alice lays wrapped in the sheets She’s trying to get up the
courage to ask him a question Instead what she asks is

ALICE (CONTD)
What do they look like

ROLAND
Hmm
ALICE
What you see up there
ROLAND
(a beat)

Nothing up there but stars And they’re
going out one by one these days

He turns from the window Retrieves his pants and steps into
them She shakes her head his answer somehow insufficient

ALICE
So you going to save all of us Save
the whole damned world

Roland looks at her his brow furrowing

ROLAND
Why would I do that

ALICE
Because it’s your job I reckon

ROLAND
Some job But I think you got me
confused with somebody else

ALICE
Hell I do

He retrieves his shirt Seems amused by the notion

ROLAND
What’s worth saving anyway

ALICE
Compassion Reason Honor

ROLAND
Long gone all of them

ALICE
-love

Roland looks at her

ROLAND
Just a word Hardly even a memory

Alice watches him as he dresses She’s fascinated by him

if she knows better than to ask these questions but can’t

help herself

ALICE
Can you show me them Up in the sky

He just looks at her

ALICE (CONT’D)
The beams of light hold up the Tower

ROLAND
Like I said Lady Wrong fella

ALICE
I see that crest on your bag That gun
of yours You’re a Gunslinger

If her words cause a slight reaction in Roland he hides it

well

ALICE (CONTD)

My father he said all your kind died
killed when the world moved on But if
there’s even one of you left then
maybe there’s still some hope for us

As

ROLAND
Alice I found this bag and gun on the
side of the road next to a corpse who
maybe had higher ideas than I do

He looks at her as he buckles on his gunbelt

ROLAND (CONTD)
I’m sorry I can’t see beams in the
sky And I’m not looking to save the
world I’m just looking for a man

ALICE
Why

But his cold stare is all the answer she needs Finally
ALICE (CONTD)
Folks say he headed Southeast Toward
the desert

With that Roland nods heads into --

INT HER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Roland turns on the faucet Splashes brown water on his face
He looks in the mirror standing in unkind judgment of what
he sees there Closes his eyes to hide the sight of himself

EXT TULL - ALLEY - NIGHT

In the narrow brick darkness sits Nort He’s sprawled in the
dirt back up against a building stoned out of his mind

He digs in his pouch of devil-grass for another hit when a
PAIR OF BOOTS step into frame

Nort follows the boots up to the Man In Black who reaches
inside his jacket and pulls out a SMALL BOX which he
carefully hands over to Nort

Nort turns the box over in his hand it’s made of ghostwood
similar to the box The Man in Black stored his crystal ball
in Though this one has the number “19” carved atop it

As he looks back up to the Man In Black perplexed --
WALTER

No use wasting a perfectly good
resurrection

INT ALICE’S SITTING ROOM - DAWN

CLOSE ROLAND’S HANDS LIFT A DECK OF OVERSIZED PLAYING CARDS
from atop the freshly laid coffee table

Cards are shuffled notice a card with a drawing of THE
TOWER another with a likeness that resembles WALTER

WIDER Roland continues to shuffle as slanted morning sun
highlights dust motes in the air Alice appears behind him
with a pot of coffee as he cuts his deck twice

ALICE
Nescafe No real coffee anymore

He nods MUTTERS a ritualistic SAYING under his breath
begins laying out the cards inward to form a simple cross

ROLAND
(without looking up)
Can you draw me a map
ALICE
There isn’t enough of this place to
need a map

ROLAND
Of what’s Southeast Beyond the desert

She fills the mug before him

ALICE
Men and vengeance

He ignores her cuts his cards again places two more
ALICE (CONTD)
Suppose this fellow you seek kills you
instead that’s all it amounts to
One card is The Lady of Shadows The next is The Prisoner
ROLAND
What happens when I find him is in the
hands of Ka

Then Roland draws and lays down the final card in the center
of the cross It’s one word and image are simple

The Boy

Roland stares at the upturned card Confused

ALICE
I don’t know what’s beyond the desert
Nobody crosses it Muties I reckon
Maybe the preacher will have a map

Roland takes a sip of coffee It burns his throat

ALICE (CONTD)
Some say it’s where you can see the end
of the world coming

ROLAND
I wouldn’t believe them

ALICE
Why not

ROLAND
The end of the world came a long time
ago

He gathers his cards stands She puts her hand on his arm
stopping him Finally that question

ALICE
Take me with you

The look she doesn’t want him to see that he’s her last
chance Final life line before she lets go and simply drowns

ALICE (CONTD)
I can trap I can cook Do more like we
did last night Different ways

Which affects him Maybe she’s even touched some emotion in
him that has been dead for a long long time

ALICE (CONTD)

Please
But still
ROLAND
I can’t
ALICE

Why The scar Too old Too hurt
ROLAND

Maybe Can’t say what you are or

aren’t But no one walks with me now

And though he doesn’t feel he owes her an explanation

ROLAND (CONTD)
Anyone who does dies Sooner or later

He heads away towards the door
ROLAND (CONTD)
(nods turns to go)
Thanks for the coffee Allie

Her eyes suddenly wet with tears

ALICE
-how did you know

He turns back

ALICE (CONTD)
They used to call me Allie

ROLAND
(a small shrug)
Seems like it suits you

As she watches him go it takes everything she has not to
shatter right there

EXT TULL - MAIN STREET - MORNING

Roland walks down the middle of Main Street The Boy tosses
his stick to the mangy dog The Old Woman knits on her porch
HUMMING softly to herself

Roland looks up at the church’s steeple-cross in the

distance With a grimace he heads towards the battered wooden
symbol

INT SALOON - MORNING

Nort enters finds Alice drying her tears at the bar He sets
something down on the bar Wildly pleased with himself

NORT
It’s for you He told me to give it to

you

Alice looks at it confused It’s the ghostwood box

NORT (CONTD)
He said it was important “Essential”
that’s what he said Give it to you
before the cowboy left town -- I hope
it’s not too late

ALICE
Who said

NORT
(confused by the question)
-him The man

ALICE
(suddenly fearing the
answer)
Whatman

She has opened its lid her eyes staring down at what
appears to be an old white jawbone inside

NORT
See see

But Alice’s eyes have gone a colorless shade of empty
NORT (CONTD)

He said you should show it around Like
a fancy

INT CHURCH - MORNING

The heavy doors open and sunlight BLASTS in Roland enters
eyes trying to adjust to the eerie darkness

The Priestess stands at the alter
ROLAND
Mother I’m looking for a map and I’1l
pay the poor box to get it --
But he is interrupted by a GURGLE Roland’s eyes NARROW

PRIESTESS
Hurts

What he sees THE PRIESTESS HAS BEEN PINNED TO THE ALTER

PRIESTESS (CONTD)
So much

Hands staked to the pulpit by candle holders back pinned
upright to the floor by a giant taper Bleeding from ears
mouth and eyes But alive

PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
Said you’d be coming by

On Roland realizing he has a problem

PRIESTESS (CONTD)

Said I had to tell you so I could
die Said to tell you

(she struggles to finish)
Said it’s been fun but all good
things must come to an end--

(final breaths)
Said he’d meet you outside--

With that her head drops and she dies ON Roland darkness
seeping into his eyes

EXT CHURCH - MORNING
Roland steps out of the church to find

All the TOWNSPEOPLE are there waiting The church
congregation the drinkers from the bar the Boy and his
mangy dog the Old Woman Nort All now with colorless eyes
armed with weapons of every nature guns knives pieces of
wood

Roland stares at them hands drifting toward the guns on his
hips

ROLAND
I don’t want any trouble Stand fast
where you are and I’‘1ll leave
peacefully

He commands them with his gaze takes a step forward but

VOICE FROM THE CROWD
Leave to spread your evil you mean

Roland scans the crowd to identify the speaker as -- unseen
by him the batwing doors to Sheb’s Saloon OPEN and Alice
walks out

MORE VOICES
It’s him He’s the Interloper
Kill him Kill the Interloper --

And suddenly BANG Someone takes a shot at Roland -- but he
spins -- BLINDINGLY FAST -- draws and returns fire -- BAM
The shooter drops a bullet hole in his chest

The shot ECHOES -- then in the freighted silence --
ALICE (0S)

(sing-song)
Yoo-hoo

He turns Sees Alice walking toward him Her eyes are
colorless Like glass

ALICE (CONTD)
Hile Gunslinger

Colors cross Roland’s face we have so far not seen Rage
And fear He closes his eyes worst suspicions confirmed

ROLAND
Walter

ALICE

Guess what you found me

can’t believe you’re still banging away

purpose is all well and good but damn
boy don’t you know fixation can be a
tad unhealthy Not to mention
boring Since we last met I’ve burned
cities to ash killed worlds with the
flu -- which I might add was one of my
more creative touches -- and what have
you done Chased after me Drank a
bunch Gotta hand it to you son you
sure are persistent

ROLAND
I am not your son

ALICE

Well I’ve been where only a father
should go don’t you think Why sweat
the small stuff

(down to business)
I’ve got big work to do Universe
wrecking work And Ka says youve
become an impediment Hooray you

ROLAND
Let go of her Walter

Alice kneels down beside the dead body then stands back up
holding a big gun pointed downward

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Don’t --

Alice facing Roland channeling Walter raises her gun Her
hands are shaking as she pulls back the hammer

ALICE
You and me cuz One last time around

ROLAND
Please

ALICE
Time to get you out of my way little
boy Old man Hard to know what to call
you after all these years Well soon
to be a moot point

Alice starts to squeeze the trigger

I thought you deserved a proper
execution

Roland SHOOTS her Dead

A frozen moment as Roland stares at her crumpled body Then
Walter’s plan is revealed as the town ATTACKS

People SHOOT throw knives launch themselves at him They
appear on rooftops Race from buildings

As Roland engages --

EXT ROAD OUT OF TULL - MORNING
Walter walks off into the rising sun his back to Tull

WALTER
(singing)
There is no pain you are receding A
distant ship smoke on the horizon

Tiny DIRT TORNADOES swirl in the wake of his boots growing
in size as --

EXT CHURCH - MORNING

ON ROLAND his pupils rack focus Only the important aspects
of FRAME are featured the targets the exits etc Roland’s
ability to shoot is spellbinding balletic --

WALTER (OVER)
(singing)
I have become comfortably numb

Roland SPINS -- fends off a knife attack with his forearm
ignoring the pain as the blade slices his skin -- he bolts
for cover behind a cart as his eyes tick up Main Street to
see a DUST STORM rolling in when -- CRASH -- a wooden fence
comes crashing down behind him and ROLAND’S CHESTNUT HORSE
CHARGES THROUGH -- in the instant before it lands atop him
Roland drops to the ground and rolls away -- BANG BANG
Roland’s bullets find the rider -- Kennerly -- who falls from
the horse dead

And still the townspeople come at him The DUST CLOUD semi-
obscuring our vision now as Roland kills with no regard for
age or sex women and children fall among the men and still
he continues killing proverbial like the slaughtering of
lambs

He was born to wield a gun But we see that doing what he is
best at makes him feel the worst about himself The violent
blows that get past his defenses almost like a penance until
finally ROLAND TAKES A CLUB TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD -- he
spins and shoots the man in the chest as the dust cloud
overtakes everything and Roland’s knees go out and HE FALLS

A long pregnant moment then the dust cloud dissipates on
the wind and among the bodies no movement at all It
appears that Roland the Gunslinger has made his last stand

The sky outside the windows is now smoky blue Jake sits at a
desk trying to focus on the math on the cabled computer

Amidst the quiet storm of furtive glances and stolen
classroom secrets Jake looks out of place solitary

Jake stops working looks up sensing something He glances
at the pencil on his desk which has begun to TREMBLE

building And then it stops

That’s when he’s attacked from behind

Jake spins TWO MONSTERS clawing at him Jake shoves one
back hard over a chair hits the other with the computer

Jake just stares in confusion at the two kids who decided to
test out their Halloween masks on him Now one is on his ass
the other is rubbing a nasty gash on his forehead

A red demon MOON plump and full TWO 34 MOONS hang low in
the dusky sky beside it above the silent town

TILT DOWN

All the roof gutters are lined with vultures beady eyes
staring hungrily at the carpet of dead in the street The
bravest among them take flight alighting pecking biting

One vulture dives down to land on a single hand the bird
pecks pecks again

WHAP A fist grabs the bird sending the others FLYING in
CACOPHONOUS SCREAMS into the closing dark

Roland rises gun still in his other hand beaten bloodied
but still alive

He stares at the dead making a small sign with his hand like
prayer He bends finds his hat and limps off down the road

EXT MID-WORLD - RECEDED OCEAN BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

The three moons glow ever brighter Beneath the water has
pulled back from the shore like gums from diseased teeth

Roland sleeps fitfully beside a dying campfire (OVER)
RUMBLING Suddenly the ground TREMBLES Exhausted wounded
Roland sleeps on

A thin wash of SICKLY GREEN LIGHT appears at the waterline
as if from the shaking of the world like an opening wound in
space -- hovering above the sand

The surface of the wound roils and creatures burrow through
Theyre abominations crustacean albino the size of
puppies eyes on stalks dripping foul venom

The world RUMBLES again and the rift closes bisecting or
maiming those creatures still trying to wriggle through

But the surviving monsters clamber up the beach -- oozing
pinchers SNAPPING CLICK CLICK CLICK --

CLOSE ON ROLAND His eyes twitch as if from a nightmare
when -- SHREEEEEEEEE

His eyes POP OPEN

Roland spins gun in his hand before he is awake SHOOTING
the small horror that is leaping towards him then NAILING
two more attackers in fast skitter-scamper advance

He doesn’t see the larger creature over his shoulder as it
leaps from a rock behind him -- Roland stands -- SNAP -- its
claw clamps shut on his hand severing two of his fingers
his gun flying

Roland HOWLS in pain as BLOOD SPURTS from his hand He rolls
free of the creature-- hand finding a ROCK and SMASHING it
down on the creature which lets out a blood-curdling CRY --

MORE CLICKING SOUNDS come from behind -- Roland rises
spinning to see -- another larger lobstrocity launching

itself at him -- WHAM It knocks Roland to the ground

SHREEEE -- the creature opens its mouth and SINKS ITS TEETH
into Roland’s side --

He SCREAMS IN PAIN as he pulls his second gun from the
holster and WHACKS the creature dislodging it from his hip -
- CLICK CLICK CLICK CLAWS SNAP AIR as it lands on the sand --

Roland BLOOD spilling from his side FIRES a cross volley
with his left hand killing the remaining creatures
Roland looks down at the wreckage of his hand his side at
the beach and the scar of the vanished portal like a dark
mark on the world

He touches his wounds Nothing good will come of this

Jake sits on the floor his sketches spread out around him
staring at image filled pages eyes frantic Searching for
something amidst the hand drawn lines

DETAIL An idealized drawing of a beach with three moons
hanging overhead

DETAIL An idealized PORTRAIT of Roland

DETAIL A frightening PORTRAIT of two men with the heads of
rats

He’s looking for something anything HIS EYES NARROW The
way the drawings haphazardly overlap

Jake begins connecting random points with a pencil until a
mosaic forms a shape of its own It could be

A HOUSE

Low-slouching roof Collapsing porch Shuttered windows like
angry black eyes

And underneath if he connects the lines just right don’t
they almost form numbers 1919 --

dangerous levels of fear and vulnerability

Jake breaks out the front doors racing across the street

EXT 1919 DUTCH HILL - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

The steepled Victorian is clearly abandoned boarded windows
sloping porch

WIDER

Jake stands on the sidewalk looking up at the perfect match
to the picture in his hand

On the porch in spray paint “TRAVELER BEYOND LIES MID-
WORLD” and “LOVE IS A ROSE BUT YOU BETTER NOT PICK IT”

Somewhere a SIREN WAILS Jake looks over his shoulder then
starts up the cracked cement path

He pushes through a rusted PROTESTING gate climbs onto the
rickety porch faces the door knob

Deep breath Moment of truth Jake reaches for the knob It
turns easily He pushes the door open and steps inside

INT 1919 DUTCH HILL - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

An immense living room illuminated by street light through
boarded windows walls stripped down to struts floorboards a
jagged toothed maze over darkness

At the far end of the room is another single door over which
grows a thick vine of bright red roses

Nothing Just an old abandoned house after all

Then the door SLAMS shut behind him Jake spins back over his
shoulder reaches back tries the knob Locked

When he looks back the room seems to have stretched away
from him the rose-covered door now a football field away

Equal parts riveted and terrified Jake takes a tentative
step toward the door then another

He’s unaware that behind him material from the house --
boards nails -- are starting to tremble and pull free

Jake is about halfway to the door when he hears a PIANO
behind him start to tremble He turns to see it slide across
the floor --

The piano picks up speed and suddenly is flying towards him
Jake has to hit the deck as it SMASHES the wall behind him

All hell breaks loose Pieces of the house are hurling
towards him more gathering like a storm in his path

The stairs ahead rip apart wood hunching up -- transforming
violently into a shape

An abomination of wood upon wood with nails as teeth under
a maw of splintering boards ROARS blocking his way --

EXT 1919 DUTCH HILL - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
From the outside the house is unchanged

A GRANDMOTHER carries a bag of groceries her young
GRANDDAUGHTER beside her

As they walk down the sidewalk the small girl glances toward
the house Then instinctively hastens her pace

INT 1919 DUTCH HILL - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

The house is anthropomorphizing around Jake wood and struts
becoming reaching ARMS and HANDS the door now in its belly

Jake is RUNNING for that door but the floor is tilting back
SLIDING away behind him

Jake DODGES the SMASHING FISTS of the wall struts

Jake is almost at the door when -- the HOUSE DEMON RISES UP
finally formed The door in its gut rises with it

As the monster bends to devour its prey Jake LEAPS toward
the rising portal in its belly --

BUT HIS JUMP IS TOO SHORT He barely manages to grab the door
frame as --

-- THE HOUSE DEMON’S HAND CLAMPS AROUND JAKE ENGULFING HIM
But to Jake’s surprise he isn’t killed Instead he hears an
(OVER) unearthly SCREAM as if it’s grabbed a burning coal

and the hand springs open

Jake falls through the doorway which is now collapsing around
him and out of our world

BLACKNESS OUR VISION FLUTTERS

Three blood red moons hang in deep sky above Two of them now
full the third nearly so

EXT MID-WORLD - NIGHT
Jake lies on his back blinking the wind knocked out of him
WIDER

Jake is in the middle of a wide ring of large druidic stones
that sit in a clearing at the edge of a forest

He takes a moment to recover his breath assess his injuries
One arm is scraped and bloody But otherwise fine

As he sits up he sees beyond the stones amidst the trees
incongruously a GAS STATION It looks a thousand years old
The area around it overgrown Still the horse and letters on
the hanging sign are familiar CITGO

Jake stands more than a bit freaked out He takes a step and
his shoe SINKS into the ground which seems somehow bloody
With effort he tugs his foot back Disgusting

That’s when a CLANGING NOISE makes him SPIN --

Hanging over the weedy ground is a Keystone Cop traffic sign
CLANG CLANG the STOP placard is replaced by GO

Jake just stares at it Bumblefucked

At the desk sits PIMLI PRENTISS round balding Mayor Or
warden depending on your point of view

Sitting on the desk legs crossed at the ankles and giving
Pimli a manicure is a buxom girl with the head of a red fox

PIMLT
Lovely dear lovely

Hello Pimli

The door swings open Pimli practically knocking the girl off
his desk as he recognizes stands to face his visitor

WALTER (CONTD)
Dont get up on my account

PIMLI
(flustered)
All hail the Crimson King

WALTER
Yes

Walter steps into the room towards a liquor cart the young
Fox-headed Taheen is already pulling on a human face mask
bowing and backing out as Walter pours two drinks

WALTER (CONTD)
I would have been back sooner Had to
kill an old friend

Pimli accepts his scotch throws it back in one shot

WALTER (CONTD)
Your hand is shaking Pimli

PIMLI
You scare the shit out of me Walter

This seems to please Walter He takes a step closer to Pimli

WALTER
Yes well You know what they say
(Pimli blinks in fear)
Never let them see you sweat

With that Walter reaches up and adjusts Pimli’s face which
we now realize is also a skin mask

Pimli breathes again as the Man in Black walks to the window
stares up at the darkening sky

WALTER (CONT’D)
Did you know they have names The
Elephant The turtle The one we
cracked last week is called the Hare

PIMLI
Sir

WALTER
The beams that hold up the Tower
Theyre really quite beautiful in their
way Frankly I had hoped we’d have
broken at least one by now
(beat)
Are we ready for tonight

PIMLI
(really scared now)
Weve gotten new children Better
children

Walter opens his hand and a small ball of fire forms in his
palm Sweat beads on Pimli’s face as the fire grows

WALTER
The third moon will be full by tomorrow
and then we’1ll have lost our chance

Pimli fights to keep his knees from knocking
PIMLI

Youll see we’ll crack the beams
before the moons turn full

WALTER
Good You wouldn’t want to fail me
Pimli

PIMLI
Fail No No It’s perfectly under
control

The fire in his palm reflects in his colorless eyes

VOICE (OVER)
We have a situation --

The door is already swinging open to produce FINLI head of a
weasel who now seeing Walter drops to one knee and bows

FINLI
All Hail the Crimson King

PIMLI
(worried for him)
Not the best time

Finli is pulling a skin mask from his back pocket and donning
it hastily so it doesn’t quite fit a disconcerting result

FINLI
Let me just put on my face

WALTER
What situation

Finli glances nervously at Pimli

WALTER (CONTD)
I’m not fantastic at waiting

FINLI
We’ve had an unauthorized crossing The
Brooklyn portal on Keystone Earth

PIMLI
That’s impossible

No one says anything

WALTER
Howd they get past security

FINLI
That’s just the thing The house demon
is offline I think it’s dead

Walter SIGHS

WALTER
Listen today’s my day at the prom
The tower falls tonight Nothing screws
it up I’m going to see what all this
distraction’s about

He closes his fist around the fire EXTINGUISHING it

WALTER (CONTD)
You get the kids ready Maximize them
Drop them in a tank full of nightmares
and steroids Strip their skin off and
feed them back their screams Do
whatever it takes but make sure they’re
fully charged

With that Walter turns to leave

Today’s not a good day to disappoint
me Comprende

EXT MID-WORLD - ROAD - WALKING - DAYBREAK

Hazy morning sun cuts through the trees casting the gas
station in a golden hue Jake moves cautiously across the
broken tarmac unsettled by the foreign surroundings

A bird WAILS in the distance Jake’s eyes snap up to the sky
The clouds seem to drive towards the distant horizon
rushing as if pointing the way

Ahead Jake spots a kiosk of apparently ancient vending
machines tangled in overgrowth on the side of the broken down
road ahead Realizes he’s starving

CLOSE ON A VENDING MACHINE A sign indicates it’s made by
“North Central Positronics -- Bringing You the World”

Jake stares at several empty snack racks behind cracked
dusty glass Most of the old labels are unfamiliar to him

He spots a lone box of Junior Mints He looks around
furtively then pulls the corresponding knob No luck He
slips his arm into the drop slot trying to pry the candy out
of the machine when he hears a RUSTLING --

His back stiffening in fear he turns as trees shake and a
DEER emerges into the road As it ambles toward him Jake
sees that it has a blind third eye in the center of its head
and a hanging vestigial fifth leg

Eyes wide with terror Jake is frozen to the spot his arm
stuffed up inside the vending machine as the awful creature
stumbles toward him then --

A muffled K-RACK The deer startles bounds off back into the
tree line

Jake lets out a breath as he hears another K-RACK echo
through the woods Sounds like a GUNSHOT

CLOSE ON ROLAND’S GUNBELT as he shifts it across his waist
onto his left hip

ROLAND’S VOICE (CONT’D)
I do not shoot with my hand He who
shoots with his hand has forgotten the
face of his father I shoot with my
mind

Roland stands forty yards from the row of impromptu targets
His right hand is wrapped in a field dressing the strips of
fabric stained with blood

Angry red striations snake up his forearm infection
spreading in his blood But Roland ignores that as he softly
mutters his mantra

ROLAND
I do not kill with my gun He who kills
with his gun has forgotten the face of
his father I kill with my heart
With that he QUICKDRAWS with his left hand
FIRES

And misses

Roland just stands there Gun still leveled Staring at the
can Not at all happy

EXT MID-WORLD - GREAT WEST WOODS - MORNING

Jake peers from behind a tree In the distance he can see the
man from behind He watches as Roland draws and FIRES

Jake ducks out from behind the tree and creeps closer

He loses sight of Roland as he moves past more trees -- then
steps out into a clearing and stops confused --

The man is no longer there
CLICK

Jake spins Finds himself staring into Roland’s gun barrel
Roland draws back the hammer

ROLAND
Sneaking up gets you killed

Roland has somehow crept up behind him But despite Jakes
fear somehow he’s also quietly thrilled

JAKE
Youre real

Roland just stares at the boy His odd clothes His twinkling
eyes As if part of some great cosmic joke

JAKE (CONT’D)
I knew you were real

ROLAND
Who are you boy

JAKE

ROLAND
(frowns )
You drew me From your deck

Jake slings his backpack from his shoulders removes his
sketchbook and offers Roland some drawings in his pad --

JAKE (CONT’D)
See

Roland looks at the drawing flipping through Jake’s hands

JAKE (CONT’D)
I think I was sent here to help you

Rolands eyes tick from the drawings up to Jake If you were
to say he’s displaying an emotion it wouldn’t be
fascination Or amazement More like annoyance

JAKE (CONT’D)
Help me

If he had it in him Roland might CHUCKLE He doesn’t
JAKE (CONTD)
You look like you were in some

fight

ROLAND
Where do you hail from Jake Chambers

JAKE
Sorry

ROLAND
Your home

JAKE

New York But you’ve probably never --
Roland’s eyes darken but he says simply

ROLAND
Then I bid you safe journey back

JAKE
Back What No --

Jake looks up from his drawings sees that Roland has turned
and is already headed off

JAKE (CONTD)
Wait

Roland doesn’t look back just disappears into the woods

Wait

EXT HAUNTED HOUSE - BROOKLYN - DAY

Walter stands looking at the house which from out here
still looks perfectly normal He starts up the cement path

INT HAUNTED HOUSE - BROOKLYN - DAY

Walter opens the door walks inside CLOSE ON HIS FACE as he
surveys the room

WHAT HE SEES the structure has seemingly restored itself to
its benign state Just the interior of an abandoned house

But Walter notes DETAILS the iron staircase RAILINGS are
subtly mangled the plaster MOLDINGS oddly out of place
FLOORBOARDS out of alignment As if the house has been
reassembled by Dr Frankenstein

And from the closed doorway at the far end of the room comes
a faint BUZZING

Walter frowns crosses the room to the doorway and opens the
door to reveal a flat BRICK WALL

The buzzing is LOUDER here Walter grips the door-frame and
the rotted wood easily peels away in his hand revealing
teaming scores of TERMITES which BUZZ excitedly as they
scatter down the wall

Walter spots a small DARK STAIN on the door-frame He scrapes
some off with his long fingernail examines it closely

WALTER
Who’s been sleeping in my bed

EXT WEST 61ST STREET - DIXIE PIG - NIGHT
A dark storefront bar That single crimson eye painted on

the heavy door JAZZ spills into the night as Walter vanishes
inside

INT DIXIE PIG - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Walter walks wordlessly past a burly bouncer who simply
averts his eyes heads down a long red hallway into --

INT DIXIE PIG - BAR - CONTINUOUS

The bar is crowded with patrons very few of whom are human
Taheen Low Men and Vampires play pool slide the puck up a
bowling machine feed the JUKE BOX flirt or feed

Weasel and chicken countenances look up and fall silent as
Walter passes the monster who scares all the other monsters

At a table in the back a group of men and women are playing
poker They look up as he approaches faces white as sheets
fangs glistening behind joyless smiles VAMPIRES

The thinnest of the group has a frowning face and oddly
laughing eyes His name is RICHARD SAYRE clearly the boss

WALTER
(perfunctory)
All Hail the Crimson King

SAYRE
Yes All do

He holds Walter’s eyes competition respect loathing a
heady brew of bitter emotions and history between these two

SAYRE (CONTD)
To what do we owe this visit from his
Majesty’s loyal servant

Whatever the backstory here it’s not pretty
WALTER

The house demon we bought for our door
in Brooklyn is dead

SAYRE
(shrugging)
They just don’t make ‘em like they used
to
WALTER

Maintenance is part of the contract
One stud vampire takes a drag of his cigarette FRANK

FRANK
You’re the ones using the house to
transfer children off world Who says
you didn’t break it yourselves

Walter’s eyes flick to the youth

WALTER
Did you just speak to me without being
spoken to vampire

Hard to make a table full of vampires’ blood run cold But
apparently Walter has done just that

SAYRE
No need for unpleasantness The boy is
an idiot But he does make a point

Walter withdraws from his pocket a small plastic baggy
Offers it to Sayre

WALTER
Whoever got through left a little blood
behind Be a good dog

Sayre glares at Walter a beat then shakes the BLOOD SAMPLE
out onto his palm LICKS IT with forked tongue

WALTER (CONTD)
Vampires So few uses so much time

SAYRE
A boy Young On the cusp of puberty

Walter just stares at him I’m listening

SAYRE (CONT’D)
(then)
House demons are old Outliers They
can transport all the little telepaths
his Majesty’s heart desires

WALTER
But

SAYRE
But in theory try to send a strong
enough psychic through he might
overload it

WALTER
Kill it you mean Just by using the
portal

SAYRE

He’d have to be tremendously powerful
Walter nods thought something like this might be the case

WALTER
I need him identified

SAYRE
Do you now What’s in it for me

WALTER
Don’t play games with me Richard You
swore your kind to His service

SAYRE
Ah but this matter seems so timely

Walter says nothing

SAYRE (CONTD)
I’ve felt the earthquakes Word on the
street is you’ve got something big
coming down in the next few days
Something world shattering you might
say

WALTER
What do you want

SAYRE
I know that when the tower falls He has
promised you this world I want enough
humans to breed and keep me fed for a
very long time Say eternity

WALTER
Done

Sayre nods turns to one of the others

SAYRE
Send a conjurer and a tech team to
Brooklyn

WALTER

Next time I’1l teach you how to roll
over Maybe even play dead

(off Frank)
And he did

FRANK
What

WALTER
Speak when not spoken to
(to Sayre)
Kill him

SAYRE
(sighs )
As you wish

As Walter walks away from the table we hear Frank’s PROTESTS
silenced by the sound of his SNAPPING NECK

EXT MID-WORLD - RYE PLAYLAND - DUSK

The amusement park has been abandoned centuries earlier The
skeletons of rides and arcade booths litter the fairway

Roland stands cooking over a small fire against a sea of
stars He is wrapping his damaged hand in a fresh bandage
The angry red infection stripes are chasing up his shoulder

He wipes sweat from his clammy forehead tosses the
discarded bloody bandage HISSING into his FIRE

He glances up at a boy’s silhouette sitting on an elevated
fragment of blacktop thirty yards away Roland turns a small
carcass roasting on a spit After a long moment he SIGHS

ACROSS THE PARK --
Jake sits with his arms wrapped around his shoulders

shivering His stomach growls as he hears a crunch and looks
up to see Roland walking toward him

Roland stares down at Jake a long beat then

ROLAND
I thought I was clear boy Go home

JAKE
(really pissed)
Don’t worry On my way First thing in
the morning Next flight out

ROLAND
(turns to go)
Good

JAKE
I was joking

Roland stops turns back

JAKE (CONT’D)
You have that here Everyone is like
you I’m guessing not so much

Roland just looks at him The boy is trying hard to hide his
vulnerability behind the bravado

JAKE (CONTD)

Look I can’t leave okay I don’t know
how

(then)
And I don’t want to I mean as much as
I want to I don’t

(threadbare)
You don’t understand how hard I’ve been
trying to

(believe in)
Find you

ROLAND
Then you’ve wasted your time

JAKE

(as Roland turns)
Wait

(off Roland’s glare)
I’m scared all the time You don’t know
what it’s like Like there are bugs
inside the walls of the house and no
one can hear them just me Only its
not just the house it’s everywhere

(finally)
Am I crazy Am I crazy or is everything
really ending

Roland stares at him a long beat

ROLAND
Yes

JAKE
Yes what

ROLAND

You aren’t crazy

Jake closes his eyes in a combination of confirmed dread and
impossible relief

JAKE
Why

ROLAND
There is nothing exists that something
doesn’t long to destroy

JAKE
But it’s your job to save it right

Roland just stares Who is this kid

JAKE (CONT’D)
That’s why I’m here I can help you--

That’s when Roland draws and aims his gun right at Jake

JAKE (CONTD)
Wait-

Roland FIRES Actually past Jake’s shoulder Missing but
scaring off a mutated three headed snake Jake stares after
the slither-limping creature in horror

ROLAND
Help me Wanton impudence

Roland glances at his gun worried that he missed the snake

ROLAND (CONTD)

You have forgotten the face of your
father you shame him I have no job to
save anything and even less use for a
child such as you

(holsters his gun)
Stay leave As you wish But when I
set off in the morning I set off
alone

With that Roland turns and heads back to his fire
JAKE
(small)

Draw a hero Nice Some fucking hero

Jake wraps himself in the blanket looks off into the
darkness and the unseen horrors there determined not to cry

EXT MID-WORLD - RYE PLAYLAND - LATER - NIGHT

Jake lays asleep under the blanket the old tin clown on
Pennywise’s House of Horrors bowing in the wind

MANS VOICE (OVER)
(very faint)
Jake

Jake’s eyes flutter open

MANS VOICE (OVER) (CONTD)
Jake

He sits up Looks at Roland asleep by his fire

MAN’S VOICE (OVER) (CONTD)
Over here kiddo

Jake shakes his head Then with a last look to the sleeping
Roland heads towards the sound into the darkness

EXT MID-WORLD - NIGHT

Jake walks away from Roland’s campfire into the woods The
night is sharp as crystal stars shine through the canopy of
trees like pinholes in the black velvet sky

A SIGN that must be at least a hundred years old reads
Welcome To Roosevelt Syracuse International Airport
Spray painted across the sign are the words We All Float
Jake can see beyond the edge of the woods a long strip of
tarmac once an airfield but now cracked overgrown with

weeds and littered with broken aircraft

MANS VOICE (OVER)
Jake

From beyond a distant ravaged service building golden light
halos into the night sky

MANS VOICE (OVER) (CONTD)
Jake Back here

Jake frowns then he heads toward the building and the
glowing light beyond shining like a beacon

EXT MID-WORLD - RYE PLAYLAND - CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

Roland opens his eyes to a DEAFENING ROAR as if his campsite
is in the center of a ROILING WAVE He sits up

Actually takes him a second to get his bearings as he shivers
and wipes the clammy sweat off his brow

He glances up to where Jake was sleeping The boy is gone
ALERT now

ROLAND
Boy

But he cannot hear his own VOICE so loud is the ROARING And
Roland can now hear the tip of another sound a thousand
VOICES calling SCREAMING

Roland flips open his gun shoves a bullet in one ear
halving the SOUND then another bullet in the other ear
world now mercifully silent

ROLAND (CONTD)
Damn him

He is up and racing fast into the night

EXT MID-WORLD - ABANDONED AIR-FIELD - NIGHT

Jake walks towards the building golden glow spilling from
beyond it making the cracked tarmac glitter like diamonds

MANS VOICE (OVER)
Back here kiddo

Jake rounds the crumbling building and is washed in warm
golden light his eyes going wide in wonder

EXT MID-WORLD - BEHIND THE BUILDING - NIGHT

A large shimmering PORTAL hovers over the tarmac Beyond its
glittering surface is a New York street busy with the
pedestrians and traffic of a contemporary Manhattan night

On the sidewalk stands a MAN in modern dress his face half-
shrouded in the shadow of a street lamp

JAKE
-Dad

JAKE’S FATHER
Hey kiddo Long time How you doing

JAKE
You -- You can’t be here You’re dead

Jake’s father CHUCKLES a rich kind SOUND full of sweet
mischief

JAKE’S FATHER
Son have you seen this place Magic
portals Three-eyed deer Welcome to
Mid-World Normal rules need not apply

Jake stares at his father only now really knowing how fully
starved for him he has become

JAKE’S FATHER (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I let you believe I was dead
I should never have gone along with it--

JAKE
-- What I don’t understand You --
they gave us a medal
(near breaking)
We buried you

JAKE’S FATHER
It’s a long story But we’ll have time
for that now I made a mistake Jake
I should never have left you and your
mother alone Especially not with that
asshole

Jake can’t contain a surprised smile

JAKE
You know about Lon
JAKE’S FATHER
Jake I’ve been watching you every day

of your life

Jake can think of a thousand things to say but only finds the
very simplest of words

JAKE
I missed you so much Daddy

JAKE’S FATHER
I know son I’m sorry But I’m here
now

Jake’s father his face still half obscured reaches across
worlds out towards his son

JAKE’S FATHER (CONT’D)
I’m going to take you home

EXT MID-WORLD - ABANDONED AIR-FIELD - NIGHT

Roland breaks the tree line racing dead out across the
tarmac Ahead is the broken building and glow behind

But the light spilling past it onto the tarmac isn’t golden
instead the sickly pallid green of the portal on the beach

Instinctively Roland’s right hand reaches for his gun
realizes fingers missing -- draws instead with his left --

EXT MID-WORLD - BEHIND THE BUILDING - NIGHT
Jake faces his father

JAKE’S FATHER
Take my hand son Come home

Jake reaches toward his father

EXT MID-WORLD - AIR-FIELDBEHIND THE BUILDING - NIGHT

Roland whips around the building gun opening in front of his
chest still running --

What he sees No New York No smiling father

About a hundred yards away Jake reaches up towards a nasty
event horizon beyond which roil INNUMERABLE MONSTERS OF
IMPOSSIBLE SIZE AND VARIATION linked only by their utter
otherness their pure insatiable hunger --

A school of creatures like bloated ambulatory piranhas with
legs and eyes on stalks and fanged mouths press against the
inside of the thinny gnashing maws distending the
dimensional membrane towards Jake as he reaches out --

Suddenly a large shadow rushes from behind the piranhas and a
much BIGGER MONSTER chimps them RAMMING the membrane moving
teeth stretching the lip of the membrane even closer to Jake

SUDDENLY SHOTS -- the creature’s eye stalks EXPLODING the
giant mouth jerking incrementally backwards with each IMPACT

WIDER Roland is SHOOTING with his left hand what he lacks
in precision he makes up for with an unyielding attack as he
runs straight toward the thinny’s watery face --

As he reaches Jake he jerks him back with his ruined hand
and FIRES a SHOT right next to Jake’s ear with the other

Jake is reaching up to his father’s hand when the sudden
EXPLOSION tears away half the world of New York the monsters
revealed in its place

Jake’s hand goes to his RINGING ear

Another SHOT in his other ear and the other half of New York
is gone replaced by the monsters

Jake just stares -- his ears RINGING as --

Roland throws Jake backward hard hurling him onto the tarmac
behind him --

ROLAND
(lips moving)
Run
Jake is scrambling away -- Roland marching backwards

SHOOTING holding the ground between the boy and the
expanding membrane of monsters until they are out of reach

Jake sits on his butt terrified out of breath as Roland
crosses and stands over him looking down expression dark
Jake just stares past him at the portal Finally finds his
voice

JAKE
My father I saw him in there

ROLAND
Your father

JAKE
(nods a beat)
He died A long time ago When I was a
kid

ROLAND
(considers that then)
That was not anyone you know

Roland breaks open his gun struggles with his injured hand
to replace the spent bullets as Jake continues to gather his
wits

ROLAND (CONTD)
To use your language the walls of the
universe are growing thin Those are
the bugs that chew on them servants of
the Crimson King One of their more
pleasant traits they can use your hope
like a lure to a cattle fish

JAKE

-I saw my dog get runover once

(off the portal)
That light feels like that I cant
explain

(beat)
He’s the one who’s doing all this The
Crimson King Who is he

ROLAND
Not who What

Roland holsters his gun Starts off

JAKE
(to himself)
Not really an answer

Close on Roland as he moves away from Jake who throws a last
troubled look back to the disappearing thinny and gets up to
follow Close enough to see Roland’s uncaring gaze but
also something else the dazed feverish look in his eyes

EXT NEW YORK CITY - JAKE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Jake’S MOTHER SITS IN THE LIVING ROOM PHONE BY HER SIDE THE
NEWS on the TV as she pours herself another drink Jake’s
stepfather crosses takes the drink from her hands

She looks at him with red-rimmed eyes as he sets the drink
down

JAKE’S MOTHER
How can they not have any news It’s
been almost a day

JAKES STEPFATHER
The police have his picture They’re
all looking for him He’s just a kid
How far could he go for Christ’s sake

The doorbell RINGS Jake’s mother looks up hopeful

INT THE FRONT DOOR - SECONDS LATER

As Jake’s stepfather pulls it open Walter stands there

Jake’s stepfather frowns puzzled as Walter SMILES
WALTER

So sorry to bother you I’m here about
your son Might I come in

INT JAKE’S APARTMENT - JAKE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Walter ENTERS the room holding his GHOSTWOOD BOX in his
hands He removes the small black sphere BLACK 13

JAKE’S MOTHER
(trying to contain her

hope)
You said you may have an idea where
Jake is

Walter looks up at Jake’s mother and stepfather standing in
the doorway Then down at Jake’s computer

JAKE’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
The police said he erased the drives

WALTER
Everything living or dead leaves a
stain You just have to know what
youre looking for

Walter raises the ball Utters some LOW WORDS and --

The room is suddenly occupied by the frozen ghosts of moments
past -- TABLEAUS in time overlapping one another in space
moving in reverse order Jake exiting the room stuffing his
drawing pad into his backpack working at his computer

Walter walks around the floating images examining the ghosts
of Jake’s sketches as they hang taped to the walls

JAKES MOTHER
How --

Jakes stepfather is already backing out of the room pulling
Jake’s mother with him her eyes filling with frightened
tears Walter smiles walking towards her

WALTER
He’s quite special your son isn’t he

EXT MID-WORLD - ROAD - WALKING - AFTERNOON

Roland traverses what was once a paved highway across high
green cliffs under blue sky Jake follows a dozen paces
behind walking awkwardly

JAKE
Hey Can you wait a minute

Roland keeps walking well ahead of the boy

JAKE (CONTD)
Cmon you wouldn’t have saved me last
night if you were just gonna let me die
out here

Jake sees Roland momentarily stumble as they make their way
down a slope toward a fast moving river

ROLAND
(to himself)
Bad habit

They are passing an endless spreading field covered with
swaying flowers

JAKE
Hey Please

Roland ignores him and finally Jake can’t hold it anymore
Steps into the field of flowers unzips and begins to pee

But as he waters them the flowers begin to take flight
Because those aren’t pistils they’re eyes And the velvety

petals are wings Jake jolts wide-eyed as they soar about
him in a rising wave

Ahead Roland has stopped at the river filling a jug from
his satchel Jake comes up behind him zipping up

ROLAND
(not looking up)
Stop following me

JAKE
Why won’t you let me help you

ROLAND
I’m trying to kill a man No higher
cause than that And unless you have
something more than that lawyer’s
weapon in your satchel
(Jake is surprised)
You’re no help to me at all

JAKE
Who are you trying to kill

But Roland’s answer is silence Jake watches him a moment
his mind turning over an upsetting thought Finally

JAKE (CONTD)
It’s true What you said earlier I try
to remember what he looked like but --

Roland turns to look at Jake more curious than empathetic
man long inured to heartbreak

JAKE (CONT’D)
I can’t remember his face

ROLAND
Your father is dead Like all the past
The world has moved on You should
follow its example and do the same

Roland’s body shivers despite the high sun He spills some
water on his pale clammy face

JAKE
You don’t look too good by the way

ROLAND
Ah universe saver and nurse’s maid
too Are there other wonders you have
in store

Roland crosses past him and returns the water jug to his
satchel

JAKE
(to himself)
Dick

Just then a nearby CRUNCHING NOISE makes Jake’s back
stiffen He turns scans the tall grass seeing nothing

JAKE (CONT’D)
What’s that

ROLAND
(unfazed)
Were being watched Have been for the
last six wheels

With that Roland heads off Jake looks around the fuck
TENSE now as he follows

EXT RIVER CROSSING - MID-WORLD - HIGH WIDE - SUNSET

Jake follows Roland down rolling hills towards a village of
variously sized GEODESIC DOMES made of colorful sail cloth
set amidst rich blowing corn fields

But then noting the tarmac and towers upon which the domes
sit Jake’s eyes alight with wonder and recognition

JAKE
Echoes

ROLAND
What

JAKE

It’s Newark airport

Which amazes Jake but means nothing to Roland who turns and
continues down toward the village

EXT RIVER CROSSING - CONTINUOUS - SUNSET

Roland pauses glancing up at a weather-ravaged sign
(ARRIVALSDEPARTURES”) Then his shoulders stiffen and he
continues past

Where once were runways are now lush fields being tilled by
men and women with tan skin and tied back long hair

The farmers start to notice them One by one they still their
rakes

Jake is suddenly anxious He picks up his pace sticking
closer to Roland as more folks stop working and just stare

An OLD MAN up ahead selling apples from a cart turns and
sees them suddenly going stock-still

He steps out into the middle of the road standing directly
in their path Just staring at them at Roland

Then the old man drops to one knee puts his fist to his
forehead He bows When he looks up his eyes are full of
tears

OLD MAN
Hile Gunslinger

Jake’s fear turns to fascination clocking the respect
afforded to Roland All the men and women in the fields are
dropping to their knees and saluting as well

ROLAND
(taking his hand)
Put on your hat old timer The sun is
hot

As Roland helps the man back to his feet he notes someone
moving through the field toward him

A VERY OLD WOMAN approaches Roland Jake watches Roland’s
back straighten A gesture of respect Surprising coming from
Roland The woman stops when she reaches him

ROLAND (CONTD)
Long days and good nights

VILLAGE ELDER
And to you Gunslinger
(then)
My scouts saw you coming We thought
all your kind vanished from the land

Roland says nothing She squints as she considers him Then a
smile creases her ancient features

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
Well well And on the eve of the three
full moons And here I thought all my
interesting times were behind me
(then)
But why do I ken you’re here for more
than refreshment

Roland meets her eyes A beat then simply

ROLAND
Refreshment is always welcome

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - NIGHT - HIGH ANGLE

An open air common amidst the brightly colored domes of sail
cloth Tables are set with torches and electric lanterns
Fresh food is abundant

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - HEAD TABLE - NIGHT

Roland sits at the right of the Village Elder Jake across
from her The air is festive celebratory Jake can’t believe
what’s being put down in front of him

JAKE
Pizza

He’s about to dive in when he notices the Village Elder make
a gesture over her food with her hands She circles her hand
over her plate then closes her hand in a fist and wraps it
in the other palm Apparently some form of Grace

Jake watches Roland and the villagers do the same and
approximates the gesture himself

Then he digs in Closes his eyes in delight The Elder looks
at him

VILLAGE ELDER
Good

JAKE
(smiles)
Good as Ray’s

She winks at him as he grins stretches the cheese He notes
a MANNI GIRL about his same age staring at him frankly from
across the table He awkwardly raises a hand

JAKE (CONT’D)
What’s up

MANNI GIRL
(smiles testing out the
words )
What’s up

Several more children stare at Roland When he looks at them
they race away GIGGLING

VILLAGE ELDER
(calling after)
Stop that
(to Roland)
I cry your pardon

ROLAND
They commit no offense

VILLAGE ELDER
They have never seen a gunslinger

Jake clocks the word but Roland says nothing to that
continues to eat in silence

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
That you are here gives me hope that
the world may turn again Your quest
for the Tower --

ROLAND
Ended ages ago I don’t mean to be rude
but it’s been a while since I’ve eaten

VILLAGE ELDER
Of course

Roland looks down continues eating is silence

EXT MAIN STREET - DEVAR-TOI - END-WORLD - SUNSET

Kids race their bikes play on lawns in the fading light of
another perfect evening (OVER) A BELL RINGS

Kids stop their play and look up The adults are standing
now too a few not wearing masks displaying heads of
featherless birds hairless weasels rats ferrets

The kids head towards the center of town their minders
falling in walking beside them

Norman Rockwell by way of Charles Adams

EXT LIBRARY - DEVAR-TOI - HIGH ANGLE

As the children queue into the old and steepled town library
we can see that quite a few of them now have white hair

INT LIBRARY - DEVAR-TOI - NIGHT

Children are strapped into chairs IVs slipped into implanted
arm ports by as Pimli walks the floor supervising

At the center of the circle is a DARK HAIRED BOY in a POLKA-
DOTTED CHAIR that by its design resembles a throne First
among equals Pimli CLAPS his hands a jolly camp counselor

PIMLT
Ice cream for those who do best today
And red cars and dollies Extra TV and
a trip to the fair What could be
better Isn’t this best

There is something SING SONG about his voice and liquid
amber like honey as he goes about his practiced routine

PIMLI (CONTD)
I’m proud of most of you already
Eager to say well done well done

Pimli joins Finli who is manning the bulky and aging high
tech serum pump that leads to the children’s IVs

A rusting ID plate on the machine reads “North Central
Positronics” Pimli appraises the children anxious

PIMLI (CONT’D)
(off the kids)
Some of them look pretty alert

FINLI
Pimli dessert was packed with more
antidepressants antipsychotics age
retardants and just plain old opiates
than the pharmacy counter at Rite Aid
You really need to chill

PIMLI
Chill Seriously

Finli gestures to the CLICKING pump milky viscous fluid
traveling through plastic tubes into the children’s arms

FINLI
Honey you want the neural enhancer to
work right

He gestures to the ancient machine

FINLI (CONTD)
Telekenisis is a tricky thing

Finli puts his hand on Pimli’s calming him looks at him
with beady weasel eyes mimics taking deep breaths

FINLI (CONTD)
In and out babe In and out It’s all
under control

Pimli steps out in front of the row of children

PIMLT
Time to play the storybook game
children you remember how

He closes his hands and a large patch of air in front of him
shimmers and glows filling the SCREEN

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - NIGHT

The feast is well under way A villager approaches the Elder
with TWO MUGS atop a silver tray She takes them offers one
to Roland

VILLAGE ELDER
Old Miller From the cans Saved for a
special occasion

Roland accepts a mug holds it up and toasts an old toast

ROLAND VILLAGE ELDER (CONTD)
Beer after beer One beer stands clear

They CLINK Roland takes a long draught of the beer
ROLAND

A taste I did not think I would ever
taste again Thank you

VILLAGE ELDER
So you no longer search for the Tower

Everyone’s eyes are on him Including Jake’s who pretends
not to be paying the rapt attention that he is

ROLAND
I’ve traded futility for a goal that’s
more achievable

VILLAGE ELDER
I see And what would that be

ROLAND
Revenge

The Manni woman looks at Roland Her eyes subtly narrow As
if she’s doing her best to keep judgment out of her gaze

VILLAGE ELDER
What happened to you all Our knights
Our Marines Our gunslingers

ROLAND

(simply)
We lost

He tips his mug to the air and drinks

INT LIBRARY - DEVAR-TOI
Pimli walks among the children strapped into their chairs

PIMLI
Once upon a time there was a wise and
kind ruler called the Crimson King

He opens his hands and the shimmering air now fills with a
Disney-like animation of a handsome man in flowing red gowns

PIMLI (CONTD)
He ruled over a dimension both bright
and beautiful

Now the handsome man in red robes stands on green rolling
hills populated by bounding deer and bouncing rabbits

PIMLI (CONTD)
One inhabited by the most magical
creatures ever created

One mighty elk-like creature noses up to the red-robed king
and the sovereign turns and feeds it out of his open palm

PIMLI (CONTD)
But then something awful happened

The skies over the kind handsome king go dark and stormy and
all the animals turn and run away into the forest

PIMLI (CONTD)
A hole was torn

The landscape behind the king bursts open revealing a white
hole the handsome man sucked rudely backwards through it

PIMLI (CONT’D)
And the Crimson King was pulled into
our universe and imprisoned

The handsome man now stands in a dark telescoping chamber
revealing itself to be huge the cartoon king tiny

PIMLI (CONT’D)
Trapped in a terrible Dark Tower

The chamber shrinks until we are outside a monolithic black
turreted castle set in a field of black roses the king’s
face a small white shape in a high-barred window

PIMLI (CONT’D)
Can you help the king children Can
you break down the Tower and set him
free so he can bring kindness and light
to our universe I think you can
Concentrate

THROUGH the turning animated image of the Tower the children
around the room all close their eyes

PIMLI (CONTD)
Concentrate You’ve already done well
before The beams that hold the Tower
grow weaker each time we play Maybe
today will be the day when the terrible
Tower falls

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - NIGHT

A small BAND strikes up Guitars violins and a penny
whistle Roland looks up from his food as villagers joyfully
rise from the tables forming two large circles as the band
settles into a lively IRISH REEL

A WOMAN approaches Roland offers her hand

MATRONLY WOMAN
May I have the honor

Jake expects this to go poorly but instead Roland glances at
the village elder stands and nods

ROLAND
The honor would be mine

Jake watches in wonder as Roland joins the dance

INT LIBRARY - DEVAR-TOI

Pimli paces the row of children continuing this Montessori
exercise gone mad

PIMLT
You know how to play

Pimli touches the old control deck on the pump and the fluid
delivery increases in speed and volume a reverse milking

PIMLI (CONTD)
Focus on a single point Draw light and
power to that point

Objects in the room begin to rise slightly off the floor
Even people

Suddenly one of the children’s heads goes back white energy
streaming from her throat and eyes forming a glowing bolus
in the center of the room

PIMLI (CONTD)
Those are my good good children Think
about the Tower Bring it down

Another child’s head goes back streaming energy growing the
bolus as his hair starts to turn gray

EXT DEVAR-TOI - LIBRARY - NIGHT

The windows of the building glow in the night

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - NIGHT

The dance CONTINUES Partners are exchanged The Village
Elder watches Roland bow to a new partner Though he keeps up
the dance his eyes narrow with exertion and fever

INT DEVAR-TOI - LIBRARY - NIGHT

A gray-haired child’s face begins to become translucent
Then he actually collapses into himself like glassy ash

PIMLT
Sheemie can you help the others

That turns out to be The Boy with Dark Hair’s name Energy is
flowing from him into the bolus brighter than any of the
other streams Unlike most his badge is entirely red

PIMLI (CONTD)
Can you help your brothers and sisters

Sheemie shuts his eyes tight and the beams coming from him
grow brighter and stronger still a workman straining to take
more than his share of a heavy load and slowly the few
suddenly fading kids around him remain solid again

Sheemie brow beading sweat almost shines with power

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - NIGHT
ON ROLAND as the music speeds up and the pace of the dance

quickens As Roland is joined by a NEW PARTNER the sea of
dancers seems to blur around him

EXT DEVAR-TOI - LIBRARY - NIGHT

The windows burn like suns

INT DEVAR-TOI - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Two more children become translucent and then collapse into
glittering ash gone on the wind Pimli looks to Finli

FINLI
Hang on--

PIMLI
We’re loosing a lot of them--

FINLI
One more second--

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - NIGHT

Roland twirls trying to keep up with the dancers that seem
to speed around him as the music THROBS in his head

Suddenly his dance partner is replaced by A16 YEAR OLD
GIRL impossibly beautiful golden hair and eyes like liquid
sky smiling back at him

Roland FLINCHES as if he’s been struck tries to blink away
the glowing vision --

INT DEVAR-TOI - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Another child dies vanishes in falling spirals of glassy
ash Finally Finli nods

PIMLT

Now children Let the energy free
Break the beam Now

EXT DEVAR-TOI - LIBRARY - NIGHT

The throbbing bolus of energy EXPLODES upward For an
instant a high lattice of BEAMS is visible in the sky

The energy EXPLODES in the sky high above the steeple ROARS
out in both directions in a straight line over the world

EXT MID-WORLD - BREAKER’S ENERGY PULSE - MOVING

We RACE along with the energy wave EXPLODING AND DESTROYING
land creatures all life leaving dessication and decay in
its fading wake RIPPING AWAY and supplanting even sky itself
with an ugly wet scar and the suggestion of moving shapes
beyond lurching with the unmistakable hunger of death

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - NIGHT

Still dancing Roland reaches for the young woman the
glowing vision reaches back

ROLAND
Susan --

But the dance ends the music coming to a stop and Roland
stands alone across from his dark haired partner

Roland takes a moment to recover breathing away the vision
He turns back to the Village Elder but his eyes land on
Jake who is staring back at him

JAKE
- Who was she
(off Roland’s look)
The girl
Roland’s eyes narrow

ROLAND
There was no girl

He looks to the Village Elder
ROLAND (CONTD)
Thank you Sai for your hospitality

I will be on my way --

JAKE
There was a girl there dancing--

Jake begins to stand as Roland straightens his gunbelt --

JAKE (CONT’D)
I could see her--

ROLAND
Now I would ask a favor

The Manni woman nods as if she knew this was coming

VILLAGE ELDER
You graced our table and danced the
coma-la I did not think you did so for
enjoyment much as I wished it were so
Ask and what is ours is yours

ROLAND
Id be obliged if you’d custody this
boy I’m sure he’1l work for his keep

JAKE
What

ROLAND
Take him use the old doors to send him
back to his earth make him work the
fields--

JAKE
You can’t--

JAKE (CONTD)
Sell him to the harriers for meat I
don’t care --

JAKE (CONT’D)
No --

The dishes on the table begin to CLATTER People STOP as the
plates mugs and smaller objects begin to rise slightly

VILLAGE ELDER
(darkening)
Beam quake

In the sky above them cracking energy glows Like heat
lighting and yet not at all like heat lightning

The energy created by the children rips along the horizon a
savage horizontal tornado of light

ROLAND
stands silent staring at the sky as women are rising from

the tables hurrying children back inside as the world
CRACKS shakes and MOANS

Across the river beneath the tear of spilling green light
trees and animals struck by the sickly glow turn into GLASSY
ASH that now collapse and blow away on the wind

Jake watches too scared to move as the lethal light
continues tearing open the sky overhead the spilling decay
beneath racing up the hill and towards the clearing towards
them grazing feast tables barking dogs and stunned
villagers transforming life into sudden glassy ash

WIDE ANGLE

The rend in the sky closes like diseased lips the light
falling dissipating darkness returning

JAKE

stares as floating objects drop back to the table and ground
with prosaic THUNKS (OVER) Villagers WEEP

Jake looks up at Roland with stunned horror Roland wobbles
His eyes widen as his legs give out and he falls face first
onto the ground

People GASP as the Manni woman kneels over Roland’s fallen
body She looks up dark eyes telling the tale

VILLAGE ELDER
(quiet urgency)
Sick bay And get Henchick

OFF JAKE trying to blink through the shock and horror

EXT NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

The two kids from Jake’s class the ones with the Halloween
costumes well here they are trick-or-treating

Suddenly the whole world begins to SHAKE and RUMBLE setting
off dogs and CAR ALARMS before it finally subsides

KID 1
Biggest one yet

INT DEVAR-TOI - LIBRARY - NIGHT

The children have gone A Taheen sweeps up the glassy remains
of the burnouts as Pimli stands with Finli over the console

PIMLI
(comforting)
You did your best hon

Finli shoots him a dejected look

PIMLI (CONTD)
We could try and get away

FINLI
Where could we go He’s everywhere

That’s when the door opens and a figure ENTERS so framed by
light that his black clothes make him a walking shadow

WALTER
Hello boys How’s the universe
wrecking business tonight

Both bow slightly but Finli steps forward
FINLI
It’s my fault sir The beam cracked
But it didn’t break I don’t have
enough children for another attempt
before the moons wane I failed you

Finli squeezes his eyes shut waits to die

WALTER
Tish tosh

Still bowed Finli opens his eyes casts a sidelong glance at
Pimli who almost invisibly shrugs

WALTER (CONTD)
You still have a few of the little
buggers right

FINLI
Yesyes sir

WALTER
Great Well finish off the beam
tonight Hyper stimulate the survivors

Pimli and Finli exchange a look

PIMLI
As I mentioned sir we’re too short-—-

But Walter is practically jocular

WALTER
I done found us a new quarterback

Walter walks over and pats the old US Positronics pump

WALTER (CONTD)
Dosed and wired up he’1ll probably
bring down the Tower all by himself
(turning to Pimli)
I want you to find me a boy

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - IN FRONT OF SICK-BAY - NIGHT
Jake waits nervously in front of the tent

WALTER (OVER)
His name is Jake Chambers

The Elder exits the tent Beyond the closing flap Jake can
see Roland unconscious IV bag running fluids into his arm

JAKE
Do they know what’s wrong with him

But she is clocking the destruction wrought on her village
gaze so intent Jake thinks she may not have heard

VILLAGE ELDER
Yes

And with that she starts walking

JAKE
Wait--

Jake has no choice but to follow her

VILLAGE ELDER
Whatever bit off his fingers was sick
with radiation And now that poison has
spread inside his blood too

JAKE
Will he be okay

But they have arrived at the spot where the sickly light
touched down Amongst the petrified tables and chairs
VILLAGERS caught in shock turning to flea now transformed
into GLASSY ASH A sculpture garden of the dead

VILLAGE ELDER
A beam has been weakened Here the
results are death and decay

Family members WEEP at the feet of the dead laying yellow
flowers where they stand But even now the dawn winds pull
their loved ones apart ashes lifting onto the breeze

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
But in the heavens worlds are dying
The stars themselves are winking out
Soon our universe itself will cease to
be

Jake looks at the desiccated ground the frozen dead the
WEEPING men and women impossible horror all around him

JAKE
Is he the devil The Crimson King

Her LAUGH is utterly without humor

VILLAGE ELDER
The devil is a puppy he can kick

Jake sees what he didn’t before A small glassy figure The
girl who smiled at him her eyes wide face frozen in a final
gasp of fear MAN standing WOMAN heaving in WRACKING SOBS

JAKE
Why is he doing this What does he
want

VILLAGE ELDER
Evil always whispers promises to those
who will listen But I’1l tell you what
the King really wants He wants to tear
down the walls of the universe and let
his monsters spill in No more light
No more time No more life at least
not the way we know it Just his
ungodly horrors endlessly devouring
and devoured feeding on each other for
all eternity

She looks back over her shoulder at the sick tent
VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
And our best hope to defeat him was

likely that Gunslinger

JAKE
He’s going to die isn’t he

VILLAGE ELDER
He won’t live out the week

OFF JAKE surprised at his sudden rush of spilling tears

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
I’m sorry

INT DEVAR-TOI - PIMLI’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Pimli has moved to an old computer powers it up as Walter
and Finli watch from the doorway

PIMLT
Jake Chambers We’ll issue a bounty
Get the lost pet posters up
(to the computer)
Open search protocols All worlds

Instantly a field of tiny bursts of color emit from the
machine like stars appearing in the air all around them

WALTER
This one’s shielded somehow It’s the
only reason we haven’t detected him by
now

PIMLT
He’s on keystone

WALTER
He may already be here on Mid-World

PIMLI
-here But how did he --

WALTER
Just get to work please

Pimli doesn’t have to be told twice The stars around them
begin to move Finli sifting them like a virtuoso

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - CLIFFS

Jake stands looking out into the valley and the corpse of a
city that might have once been Newark beyond

Golden light breaks on the horizon as the SUN appears The
world for all its dying can still look peaceful and
startlingly beautiful

VILLAGE ELDER (OVER)
Our doors can send you home

The older woman stands behind him

JAKE
How is he

VILLAGE ELDER
Ka is a wheel

JAKE
Whatever that means

VILLAGE ELDER
Resting
(wry)
Not very peacefully I might add

Jake turns to face her

JAKE
My world This is going to happen there
too

VILLAGE ELDER
Yes

JAKE
(agonized)
I was supposed to help him I was so
sure Why else would I have seen all
this

This gets her attention

VILLAGE ELDER
Seen how

The Elder’s eye are narrowing still fixed on Jake

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
Like you saw the girl in the dance

JAKE
I know I’m sounding crazy--

VILLAGE ELDER
I saw her too

Jake looks up at her startled

JAKE
She was there She was real

VILLAGE ELDER
There no But real yes Once

The old woman considers Then she takes his hand He feels a
light JOLT

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
The knack is called the shine or the
candle flame Most have none past
childhood Some have a touch like me
(MORE)

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
It’s how we both saw the dancing ghost
he carries with him

It is only then that Jake realizes she isn’t TALKING He can
hear her in his mind She lets go of his hand

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
(using her VOICE again)
But in a precious few it burns so
bright that the world peels back and
reveals the whisperings of places and
old things and even the inside of mens
minds A precious few like you child

As Jake hears that she nods
VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
So you say you were sent here to help

him So help him

JAKE
How

VILLAGE ELDER
Ka is a wheel

JAKE
Please stop saying that

She can’t help but smile
VILLAGE ELDER
The old mercuries might have cleansed
his blood but radiation poisoning is
an illness for which there is no longer
a cure

JAKE
The mercuries

VILLAGE ELDER
Ancient medicines Now long gone

Jakes eyes brighten

JAKE
Youre shitting me

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - MORNING

Sun washes over the brightly colored sail cloth domes

ROLAND (VO)
What’s a pharmacy

INT SICK BAY TENT - MORNING

Roland sits shirtless on the edge of the bed pulling on his
boots Ancient medtech machines line the room most broken
and patched together An IV hangs on a wooden pole

VILLAGE ELDER
It’s where medicines are kept in his
world According to the boy mercuries
are plentiful there and easy to obtain

Roland finishes pulling on his boots

ROLAND
Good luck for those who live there
(then)
I won’t burden you any longer I feel
much better now

Roland stands Tries to ignore the wave of dizziness that
triggers

VILLAGE ELDER
Right And a quest to resume
(then)
I suppose walking yourself into a grave
is not a powerful enough deterrent

He ignores that as he retrieves his shirt The ANGRY RED
INFECTION MARKS that streak his spine and back make her
pause

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
Who is Susan What happened to her
(off his look)
You called for her in your delirium
Again and again

ROLAND
All the past is dead

VILLAGE ELDER
I think I begin to understand now
(then)
With her loss went your hope

ROLAND
I have hope I hope to kill a man snap
his neck like a bird’s

The older woman says nothing glances at Roland’s deck of
cards spilling out of his bag on a small wooden table

VILLAGE ELDER
-SO when Ka speaks you listen

An uncharacteristically challenging tone in her voice He
looks at her

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
Yet Ka sent you the boy and you dismiss
him

ROLAND
He is easily dismissed He’s a child

VILLAGE ELDER

Perhaps so

(then)
Do you remember the story What the
fox said to the little prince ‘It is
only with one’s heart that one can see
clearly What is essential is invisible
to the eye’

He’s buckled on his gun-belt Now stabs his GUNS into their
holsters

ROLAND
My mother read me that story If I told
you hers I don’t think you’d like it

He starts past the Manni woman toward the door But then
STOPS He’s caught his own reflection in a mirror

VILLAGE ELDER
Youre dying gunslinger

WHAT HE SEES His face is white and sleek The red lines of
toxin are visible creeping up under the collar of his tunic

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
Youll be lucky to make it half a
wheel

He can see her reflection in the mirror behind him Despite
her advanced age he is clearly closer to death

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
Roland Deschain Son of Steven last of
the line of Eld Roland the White

He glances at her sharply She meets his gaze matches the
challenge

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
Yes We knew all your names once

She stares at him

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
So how will you exact your precious
revenge If you are a corpse

The question hangs in the air SLIGHT RACK in the mirror from
the old woman’s face to Roland’s

EXT MANNI VILLAGE - DAY

At the edge of the valley is the footprint of what was once a
terminal What remains of the building are infrequent DOORS
set in fragments of wall Some doors still have native
control panels others are connected to jury-rigged switches

Manni Technicians are attaching power enhancers to one of the
more broken ancient doors Taking readings with a set of
magnets and plumb bobs

Jake stands nearby watching He notes that on each door is a
now familiar name and logo

JAKE
Who are they anyway

One of the Technicians looks at Jake who indicates the logo

JAKE (CONT’D)
North Central Positronics

The Technician considers then shrugs as if to say no harm

TECHNICIAN
Legend has it was them that punched a
hole in the sky and allowed the Crimson
King to enter in a place called
Arrow’s Head Them and the USE Army

JAKE
The US Army

But hearing a MURMER ripple through the crowd of gathered
Manni Jake turns --

Approaching up the hill he sees the old Manni Woman leading
Roland Roland’s slow pained gait sparks Jake’s concern all
over again

WITH ROLAND AND THE MANNI WOMAN

Roland fights the temptation to take the Manni Woman’s arm
for support as he uncomfortably eyes the villagers who line

his path

He looks

bowing to him as he passes

ROLAND
They embarrass me with their respect

VILLAGE ELDER
Because you’re not the hero they want
you to be

ROLAND
I’ve made myself perfectly clear on
that account

at Jake up ahead

ROLAND (CONTD)
I’m no one’s hero
(then)
I’ll have his mercuries But for my
reasons Not yours and not theirs

VILLAGE ELDER
We’re not so naive as to doubt your
sincerity
(beat)
But as long as you’re alive we still
have a chance

Roland looks around at the broken landscape

ROLAND
World ran out of chances long ago

The lead Manni Technician nods that they’re ready

TECHNICIAN
Portal regenerator should target the
nearest un-occluded area in a twenty
meter radius for the return door

ROLAND
Should

TECHNICIAN
(I’m sorry)
The Tech is really old Sir

The Tech holds out a 70s style DIGITAL WATCH

TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
May I

Roland offers his wrist

TECHNICIAN (CONTD)
When it reaches noon it will be time
for you to cross back to this world

Jake looks at the watch confused It seems to be going
crazy the time running impossibly fast

JAKE
But -- it’s not --

The engineer meets Jake’s eye Smiles kindly

ENGINEER
Time is funny here Don’t worry --
it’ll work fine once you cross over

Roland pulls his sleeve down over the watch Jake looks
toward the high tech WHINE as the old doorway powers up

VILLAGE ELDER
(to Roland)
Ka be with you both

They walk towards the door Roland stops turns back towards
the old woman

ROLAND
I thank you for your kindness

VILLAGE ELDER
Not kindness Opportunism I still have
faith in you

He nods almost smiles
ROLAND

You think me a fool to have given up
hope

VILLAGE ELDER
Son the brutality of life leaves us
with hope or hopelessness I just think
hope is a better place to shoot from

With that she reaches up on tip toe and kisses him on each
cheek

VILLAGE ELDER (CONT’D)
It was an honor to meet you

Roland turns away before she can see the sadness in his eyes

The Elder kneels to Jake kisses his cheeks as she WHISPERS
something to him we don’t hear

Jake looks at her nods soberly then looks to Roland who is
opening the door and stepping through without a look back

Jake rolls his eyes -- dick -- then follows through the door--

And steps into BLACKNESS A beat as his eyes look to make out
any kind of shape in the darkness when SUDDENLY --

—- HONNNNKKKKKKKKKKK
Jake’s head WHIPS around as HEADLIGHTS SWEEP across his face -

- his eyes SAUCER as he sees a TRUCK bearing down on him --
HONNKKKK -- and realizes he is --

EXT NEW YORK CITY - CANAL STREET - LATE NIGHT

They’ve crossed over directly into the middle of the busy
thoroughfare to the Manhattan Bridge

Jake spins out of the way of the truck -- sees Roland frozen
to the spot amidst the NOISE and WIND and CONFUSION -- Jake
races across traffic grabs the cowboy by the arm --

JAKE
Move --

-- pulls him staggering to safety at the side of the road
Roland looks back as a car WHIPS PAST inches from his nose

ROLAND
Thought we came here to save my life

Jake breathing hard grabs the taller man by the sleeve and
pulls him away

JAKE
Come on --

EXT PRINCE STREET - SOHO - NIGHT - HIGH ANGLE

This late everyone looks a little out of place Jake and
Roland move down the sidewalk approaching a 7-Eleven

INT ELEVEN - NIGHT

DING a bell over the door CHIMES as Jake leads Roland inside
the all-night convenience store The overhead fluorescents
amplify Roland’s sickly pallor as he follows Jake across the
store to the back He gawks at the stocked shelves

ROLAND
All this is for purchase

JAKE
Yeah But it’s mostly crap The
medicine’s back here

FEMALE VOICE
Hey cowboy --

Roland’s eyes snap around Two WOMEN stand down an aisle
Low cut tops short shorts over black stockings

HOOKER
(smiles)
Wanna ride my pony

The other hooker chuckles As Roland opens his mouth to
reply a small hand tugs his sleeve Jake Pulls him away

JAKE
You don’t want to talk to them
They’re --

ROLAND
-- We have their kind in my world too

(musing)

Though usually we don’t buy them in a
store

JAKE
-- what No -- they’re not --

Jake has to stop himself from smiling Hands Roland two small
boxes of MERCURY TABLETS

JAKE (CONTD)
Hold these Don’t move I’m gonna get
us some hot dogs
(off Roland’s look)
Food Stay here I’1l be right back

Jake heads off Roland looks down at the packages in his
hand CUT TO

THE FRONT COUNTER --

The TWO MERCURY BOXES are set down on the counter TILT UP to
the CASHIER Who looks from the medicine up to Roland His
eyes twinkle in contained amusement as he rings up the
packages

CASHIER
Howdy That’s fifteen ninet--

Roland places a GOLD COIN on the counter ON THE CASHIER the
fuck Jake appears holding two Big Gulps and two hot dogs
offering a CREDIT CARD

JAKE

That’s when he notices a rack of New York Posts His own
smiling picture is on the cover under the word MISSING

through them bunching and spreading them like sail cloth

He holds up both hands and the storm stops He pulls one
close up a small bright point of light

PIMLI (CONTD)
He’s on keystone Earth

Walter who has been standing in the corner crosses

WALTER
Odd

PIMLI
And sir he’s not alone

Walter’s expression darkens as Pimli pulls up another light
point overlapping Jake’s a small rose blossom

Finli cocks his head a remarkably non-human gesture

FINLI
I thought they were all dead

Roland hikes up his sleeve 3AM

JAKE (CONTD)
Nine hours

ROLAND

Jake looks up at him surprised

ROLAND (CONTD)
That you would eat your own dogs

Shaking his head he takes a rough bite He is pleasantly
surprised

ROLAND (CONTD)
What breed is this

Jake starts to answer Decides better Looks around Even in
New York a man and a young boy alone in the street late at
night are bound to attract some attention

JAKE
Listen people are looking for me

ROLAND
A bounty

JAKE

No but -- something like that I ran
away from home

(realizing)
And I just used my mom’s credit card

(then)
We have to get away from here It’s not
safe

He pulls something from his hip
ROLAND
I’ll wait here for the door to reopen

I can defend myself

Jake glances over sees Roland raising his big GUN

JAKE
What th-- Put that away --
(quiet urgent)
You can’t do that here There are laws -
- well be arrested

ROLAND
Come as they may I am
(beat)
Hard to detain

Jake looks at him Roland’s eyes are bloodshot Unfocused
And he’s holding a loaded gun For the first time maybe Jake
is feeling that this was a mistake in over his head

JAKE
Please I’m not saying you couldn’t
kill a whole city’s worth of cops But
is that what you want

Roland says nothing

JAKE (CONT’D)
It’s too dangerous out here

ROLAND
Yes For anyone who challenges me

JAKE
Yes Fine For them Whatever We need
somewhere warm and safe where I’m not
going to get recognized -- somewhere
the medicine can start to work

The gunslinger remains impassive

JAKE (CONT’D)
Jesus Put away the gun

ROLAND
Jesus

JAKE
What

ROLAND

Jesus The Nazarene You’re familiar
with the old gods too

JAKE
Look this is my world okay You don’t
understand how things work here If
we’re going to survive you have to
listen to me now So please put away
the gun

Roland stares at him Finally holsters his weapon

ROLAND
So boy what do you suggest

The moment lasts as a MAN passes on the sidewalk As he meets
Jake’s glance passing under a neon light just for an
instant his face SHIFTS almost resembles a chicken

Just a trick of the light but Jake tenses perceptibly

JAKE
We have to go home

hand)
Here Take five

He hands Roland the medicine The Gunslinger just stares at
the small round tablets in his quivering hand

JAKE (CONT’D)

Haven’t you ever -- you swallow them

(hands him a Big Gulp)
Use this Just put ‘em on your tongue
and --

(mimics)

unexpected DELIGHT

Roland is still trying to process the cascade of sights and
sounds of the city as they arrive at the busy intersection

Jake spots an opening in traffic starts across the street
but Roland is staring at a HORSE attached to a buggy -- the
animal wears a tuxedo jacket and black top hat

Animals here still have speech

Come on

Roland follows Jake into the street

ROLAND
Then why is that horse wearing clothes

bad feeling

his eyes narrow as he follows Jake’s eye line to see --

A dark splatter on the pale carpet another on the far
wall Roland recognizes them instantly

ON JAKE just standing there staring at the blood stains as
we PUSH IN ON HIM his mind trying to deny what his heart
already understands CONTINUE PUSHING IN when --

JAKE (CONT’D)
I can’t stop I can’t stop
(starting to scream)
SEEING IT

And his SCREAMING has no end Roland glances up at thin
walls kneels before Jake gun coming up in one fluid motion

Hands moving like poetry sure despite the boy’s WAILING
stock breaking open a bullet spilling into weathered palm

ROLAND
Okay boy

Roland flips the bullet to the back of his fist fingers
moving as if playing an invisible piano the shiny cylinder
rolling from knuckle to knuckle in front of Jake’s eyes

ROLAND (CONTD)
Okay
(first time)
Jake

The bullet dances back and forth across his hand hypnotic
like water the glinting light reflecting in Jake’s eyes

ROLAND (CONTD)
Close your mind’s eye Don’t see
anymore boy

The bullet moves faster and faster still Jake’s MOANS have
quieted to WHIMPERS

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Don’t see

The boy is quiet now the fugue of seeing giving way to the
shock of loss Jake looks up tears spilling from his eyes

Roland looks back at him Despite Jake’s moment of weakness
what Roland sees instead for the first time is his
strength

EXT NEW YORK CITY - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - MORNING

The sun breaks over Central Park

INT JAKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Roland stands at the floor to ceiling living room windows
gazing out as sunlight bathes the city in a golden haze his
first view of the city in daylight

After a moment despite himself he looks up into the sky
nothing but clouds

And though he expected as much we see the flicker of
DISAPPOINTMENT in Roland’s eyes

INT JAKE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Jake’s eyes flutter open He lays on his bed a moment
disoriented trying to get his bearings

And then we watch as awareness floods into his eyes as he
remembers

INT JAKE’S APARTMENT - HALLWAYLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jake moves down the hallway As he turns into the living room
he visibly girds himself preparing himself to see the
evidence again of his mother’s death

But when he looks the bloodstains are gone

Roland stands at the window staring down at the spreading
city He turns to face Jake

ROLAND
So much like Lud before the fall

JAKE
How did I get to my bed

ROLAND
I carried you

JAKE
(off the cleaned floor)
Thank you

Jake meets the cowboy’s eyes The two just stand there

JAKE (CONTD)
I couldnt stop seeing it Like it was
happening right in front of me

ROLAND
Your time on Mid-World likely polished
your shine

Jake just nods not sure what to say
ROLAND (CONTD)
Your second sight seems to have been
all but hidden Did someone once cast a
protection glamour on you

JAKE
We don’t have magic here

Roland frowns -- unlikely -- but says nothing

JAKE (CONT’D)
You look like you’re better

It’s true the angry red stripes have vanished from Rolands
neck and arms his complexion has taken on a rosy glow

ROLAND
I swallowed another handful of
medicine I feel much stronger

Jake nods That’s good

JAKE
(first time)
Roland

Roland glances up

JAKE (CONTD)
Who was he The man whodid it

Roland closes his eyes briefly opens them again

ROLAND
One who enjoys destroying childhoods as
others do a good meal

Jake opens his mouth to respond then just closes it again
Roland has already turned away

ROLAND (CONTD)
In my world bullets have become scarce
very hard to come by I take it that’s
not the case here

JAKE
Not so much No

ROLAND
I’d like to purchase as many as I can

JAKE
Sure I can search for the closest ammo
stores

ROLAND

We have no time to search this city
The portal re-opens in two hours

Jake has crossed to the kitchen laptop

JAKE
Not that kind of search

Roland comes around to look at the screen instead fixes on
framed photo on the shelf of a handsome man in uniform

ROLAND
Is this your father

JAKE
--Yeah That’s my dad

ROLAND
He was a soldier

JAKE
No a policeman

Jake looks at Roland And for perhaps the first time in his

JAKE (CONTD)
When I was a kid some bad guys
hijacked two airplanes and flew them

into two tall buildings downtown -- the
World Trade Center The buildings
caught fire my dad he ran in to

pull people out a few years later he
got sick from what happened when they

collapsed Then he died I guess those

towers kind of held up our world too

ROLAND
When was this

JAKE
About 10 years ago

Roland seems to be doing math in his head
ROLAND

About a hundred years on my world When
the first beam broke

JAKE
What happens on your world echoes on
mine
ROLAND
(surprised but yes)
Echoes
JAKE

You see why you have to start looking
for the Dark Tower again --

Roland’s eyes cloud
ROLAND

I’ve told you the Dark Tower means
nothing to me --

JAKE
I’ve seen you looking up Looking for
the beams I know you still --

ROLAND
(killer)
Enough
(softer)
Enough

Jake has taken a step back pushed by Roland’s rage

ROLAND (CONTD)
You have done me a great service Jake
of Earth You have healed me and put me
back on my quest to find the Man in
Black By now you can swear how evil he
is as much as any of us

JAKE
Okay we’ll kill him first But then --

ROLAND
There is no we Jake Chambers Our
journey together is done and I fare
thee well

Roland glances at the computer screen then grabs his bag is
heading for the door when he stops sensing what’s happened
behind him

WIDER

Jake has drawn his gun hands shaking

JAKE
Don’t you get it You need me

Roland turns

JAKE (CONT’D)
You can’t leave me here You need me to
help you

ROLAND
Put the gun down Jake

Jake just holds it trained on the gunslinger

JAKE
Please
(small)
He killed my mom because of me

Roland stares at him a long beat Then he moves impossibly
fast Jake’s gun is on the floor and his is to Jake’s head

JAKE (CONT’D)
What are you going to do

Roland stares deeply at this boy seeing something familiar

JAKE (CONT’D)
Go ahead then shoot me

But Roland has pulled his gun away He SAYS something Jake
cannot hear

JAKE (CONTD)
What

Roland is already breaking the stock that single bullet
finding his knuckles

ROLAND
Brave
(compassion)
I said brave

And with that the bullet begins to move across Roland’s hand
like water

watching him in this otherwise empty store

Roland stabs one of the images

FAT JOHNNY
Winchester 45s Makes sense That’s
about the right caliber for a
gunfighter

ROLAND
I cry your pardon

FAT JOHNNY
Just making a joke No offense How
many you need

ROLAND
Bullets As many as you have

And we see in the salesman’s eyes that what has been mild
amusement at Roland’s get-up now turns to concern He notes
the bloodstained bandage on Roland’s damaged hand

FAT JOHNNY
50 rounds per box I think I have about
20 boxes

ROLAND

In that case all of them

As Fat Johnny moves to the storage shelves his eyes tick to
the CONCEALED GUN stored beneath the display counter

FAT JOHNNY
sure thing I’1l just need to see
your ID and gun license

ROLAND
(incredulous )
Gun license

Fat Johnny sets the first boxes down on the counter Roland
notes the sets of HANDCUFFS for sale as Johnny retrieves more
ammo

FAT JOHNNY
I know Blame Uncle Sam Can’t even
sell you any ammo without one

ROLAND
Of course --

A moment as the two men LOCK EYES

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Dont

But Fat Johnny’s hand is already darting out for his
concealed gun

Roland is way quicker moving so fast that we almost don’t

him vault over the counter -- snag the handcuffs from the
wall and -- SHNIKK -- cuff Fat Johnny’s gun hand -- SHNIKKK --

to the display case

gone The cabbie lies on the sidewalk body twisted in ways a
body is not meant to twist dead

(OVER) A MOAN Coming from inside the cab

Roland moves to the taxi looks through the shattered front
windshield -- and sees the black-cloaked form inside

ROLAND
(simple)
Where did they take him

The Vampire lifts his head looks up from beneath his cowl
HIS SHOULDER AND HALF OF HIS FACE HAVE BEEN SHOT OFF he’s in

horrible pain and despite that he curls what remains of his
lip into a grin

VAMP
Gotta hand it to the kid tough little
shit

ROLAND

--how ‘bout you How tough are you
Tough enough to spend the rest of
eternity in pain With half a face and
only one arm

The Vampire meets Roland’s eye confused

VAMP
Can’t say I won’t miss my cheek But I
still got both my arms

ROLAND
-so far

With that Roland slips his HUNTING KNIFE from his waistband -
- the Vampire’s face dawns with a horrible understanding as
Roland reaches in through the open door --

VAMP
No --

ROLAND
Tell me or I cut off the other arm And
a few of the smaller bits too

The SOUND of approaching SIRENS in the distance
ROLAND (CONTD)
You know the rules You’1l have to burn

yourself up before they see you

getting LOUDER

Where did they take the boy

Roland leans in with his knife

VAMP (CONTD)
Hey -- we had a deal

Right No cutting

Roland roughly grabs the Vampire by the cloak and DRAGS him
from the cab into the street

As the cowl falls from the creature’s face and the SUNLIGHT
hits his body the Vampire catches flame -- SCREAMING
horribly as he turns to DUST

Roland has already turned away moving to his horse when

REVERSE TO REVEAL Roland across the street arriving atop
his horse eyeing the bar Measuring the place

Then he draws his gun swings himself down and we CUT TO

A SONG plays on the JUKE BOX as we PUSH THROUGH THE LENGTH of
the crowded bar and as we approach the front door --

WHAM The door BANGS open sunlight spills in The Vampires
reflexively shield their faces as all heads -- Vampire
Taheen and Low Men alike -- turn to the open doorway

But no one is there

A frozen moment then the BARTENDER flicks a look at two
LARGE BOUNCERS who nod in response

The bouncers each draw a GUN cock them and step outside
into the light

A long moment all eyes on the empty door-frame no one
uttering a sound just the MUSIC playing on the jukebox
then just as the song ENDS from outside

BANG BANG

A moment of silence as glances are exchanged then almost as
one every patron in the bar withdraws a weapon the juke
box WHIRS as a new platter is put in place and a song starts
A familiar MELODY

Hey Jude don’t make it bad

CRASH The WINDOW furthest from the door SHATTERS as Roland
BURSTS INSIDE HIS GUN ALREADY BLAZING AS SHOCKED PATRONS
TURN TO HIM RETURNING FIRE --

What happens now happens all at once as for the first time in

our story we see what Roland is truly capable of with his
GUN in his left hand and his HUNTING KNIFE in his bandaged

right he is poetic operatic a soul meant for shooting --

Take a sad song and make it better

Roland shapes the arc of his BULLETS with his HAND with the
movement of his BODY as he advances through the bar --
Taheen Low Men and Vampires FALLING SPINNING bottles and
mirrors SHATTERING bodies FLYING backwards from the load of
his bullets Returned FIRE is a rain that never touches him --

Remember to let her into your heart

ROLAND’S EYES a light we haven’t seen before dizzying and
terrifying -- a warrior’s light -- as he moves through the
enemy ranks like a swimmer through water -- grabbing them as
semi-human shields FIRING SLASHING --

Then you can start to make it better

His HANDS KNIFE and GUNBUTT like clubs as he SLAPS his chest
to reload between vollies -- spinning as he FIRES crouching
standing -- all the while driving toward the back of the bar

and the stairs that lead to the basement --

small drop of FIRE which floats above his open palm

a HOLE beginning to burn a slowly growing PORTAL OF FIRE
spreading to REVEAL THE FABRIC OF REALITY ITSELF rending as
if made of knitted thread

BAM -- slaying them both -- the Taheen crumple to the

A teen boy seems to react first eyes springing wide head
going back in a kind of rapture

A force can be seen emanating from his throat and chest like
light like water streaming towards the center of the room

Now another two children’s heads go back eyes rapt energy
flowing from their throats growing the indoor sun

In the center of the circle of children a blinding bolus of
energy begins to form

Jake resists A VIBRATING WHISPER He looks up to see Sheemie
looking back at him

SHEEMIE
(mouthing)
Fight it

Sheemie is obviously trying to do just that but the strain is
showing Suddenly his head goes back eyes locking as energy
pours from him and the bolus glows ever brighter

ON Jake as he stares at the slowly fading portal in the wall
the basement of the Dixie Pig slowly vanishing from sight

Suddenly Jake’s head is snapped back power pouring from him
his stream exponentially larger and brighter than the rest

in front of the bar

A doorway stands in the middle of the street invisible to

Cops are spilling out of their cars drawing their guns

Drop your weapons

But Roland pays them no mind simply opens the door and steps
through it

As far as the startled cops are concerned the guy just
vanished

EXT MID-WORLD - DAY

And steps through a doorway in the Manni Village The Village
Elder stands with many of the others

She looks to the door behind Roland But one look at his eyes
tells her all she needs to know

Roland looks around his face hollow grieving but then
as his eyes tick up they WIDEN with surprise

And we slowly ANGLE AROUND to what he sees
High in the sky set amidst puffy cumulus clouds
Isa beam ONE OF THE BEAMS THAT HOLD UP THE TOWER

Roland’s humorless chuckle lives somewhere between awe and
irony He wipes his brow with his hat

ROLAND
Just a boy the one owed for this

VILLAGE ELDER
Old enough to do some good is old
enough these days

ROLAND
Glad to have walked with him Sorry for
what he spent

VILLAGE ELDER
Id wager he’d say fair price if we
could ask him

Roland looks at her a long moment then he nods for the
first time in ages embracing the burden of leadership

ROLAND
Long days and pleasant nights

VILLAGE ELDER
Long days and pleasant nights to you
young man And to us all

Roland returns his hat to his head tips it begins to walk
away in the direction of the beam

MANNI ENGINEER
That man’s going to save us all

VILLAGE ELDER
Better him than you or me

He might just have a chance at it

There is a twinkling light in the old woman’s eyes as she
watches him go vanishing into the setting sun

Above him the BEAM is plainly visible in the night sky
Beyond it we see the waning moons The danger has passed

having arranged them in the familiar cross now MUTTERS his
ritualistic saying -- as he turns over the CENTER CARD And
his eyes widen because

It’s THE BOY

ON ROLAND He just stares at the card as the fire lights his
eyes If Ka deems it then so it shall be

Roland picks up the card slips it in his shirt’s breast
pocket As he slings his pack over his shoulder his eyes set
in determination And something else HOPE

WIDE Roland sets off across the desert

horizon walking beneath the fast rushing light of the BEAM
