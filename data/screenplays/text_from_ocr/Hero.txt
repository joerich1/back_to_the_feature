INT COURTROOM - DAY
JUDGE GOINES turns to the Jury FOREMAN
JUDGE GOINES
Mister Foreman have you arrived
at a verdict
FOREMAN
We have your honor We find the
defendant guilty of all the charges
TITLES BEGIN OVER THE SCENE
ANGLE ON THE DEFENDANT BERNIE LAPLANTE

Forty rumpled cheap suit cheap haircut He reacts turning
to the jury indignant

His attorney DONNA ODAY rises Shes twenty-four looks
younger

DONNA
Your honor may I approach the

bench

As BERNIE fumes the JUDGE DONNA and the youthful clean-cut
PROSECUTOR engage in an earnest inaudible discussion

Frustrated Bernie is watching them when he notices something
that distracts him from his anguish

Donnas wallet is lying in her open attache case The open top
of the case screens the wallet from the view of the JURY THE
JUDGE COURT REPORTERS etc

Bernie looks around checking the spectators section

No spectators
TITLE CONTINUE

Bernie gets the wallet to his lap In between cautious glances
toward the bench where the conference continues inaudibly he
surreptitiously selects some of the twenties and some of the
tens from the wallet

AT THE BENCH

The conference breaks up DONNA heads back toward the defense
table

The wallet still concealed in his lap under the table BERNIE
is indignant

BERNIE
Whats going on Guilty What
is this

DONNA

I got your bail continued

BERNIE
Bail for Chrissake Im innocent

The JUDGE gavels for order as BERNIE slips DONNAs lightened
wallet back into her attache case unseen

JUDGE GOINES
Mister LaPlante I have been
persuaded in view of your continued
employment and your lack of prior
convictions to continue your bail
under the same conditions
heretofore pending sentencing six
days from now In the meantime you
will make an appointment with the
probation officer who will make a
recommendation to me regarding your
sentence I urge you to use these
six days to set your personal
affairs in order in anticipation
of incarceration

THE TITLES CONCLUDE

INT CORRIDORHALL OF JUSTICE - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

BERNIE and DONNA are hurrying along the crowded corridor outside

BERNIE
Anticipation of incarceration

income a little with some
business deals maybe summa the
guys I sell to are crooks how

responsibilities who happened to

(with difficulty)
Uh I know youre having financial
difficulties Mister LaPlante but

slightly soiled look

JOEY

JOEY is indicating the next cage where a BLACK PANTHER is pacing
restlessly to and fro

been favorably resolved Ina
business sense I believe weve
turned the corner

GALE GAYLEY a TV reporter is standing close to BROADMAN a
microphone in her hand Shes thirty attractive dignified
We can hear SIRENS in the distance and closer the CRACKLE

of radios and walkie talkies

GALE
Mister Broadman your wife and
children are on their way here as
we speak Dont you think --
BROADMAN
I feel Ive done very well in
life good health wonderful
family much wealth I guess what
were talking about here is a kind
of despair I just have the
feeling that everything from here
on is going to be downhill
At a time like this I think Im
entitled as the saying goes to
look out for number one and put
my own needs first That pretty
much concludes what I have to say
Thanks for coming out here to let
me talk to you and your viewers

A nice smile as he drops RIGHT OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME
ANGLE ON GALE
Looking down horrified

GALE
Oh my god Chucky tilt down

Her cameraman CHUCKY twenty-five is already urgently tilting
his vidpak as WE REVEAL that he and GALE are standing on a ledge
many stories above the street

GALE
Did you get it
(then doubly
horrified)
Jesus did I say that

CHUCKY

skyscraper over there find you
here then reveal the drop

TV IMAGE (EXT OFFICE BUILDING LEDGE - DAY)

Later the CAMERA finds GALE in mid-sentence standing on the
ledge wearing her broadcast voice and persona

GALE
(into mike)
Suicide number 137 of this year
in this city was neither a
destitute nor a lonely man but
a successful executive with a
loving family and forty million
dollars in the bank If theres
nameless despair in executive
offices what can there be sixty
stories below where the hungry and
the homeless the brutalized and
the addicted fight their daily
battle for survival

GALE

CHUCKY
I told them how you were upset we
didnt save the guy

DEAKINS
Saving people is not our job Its
as wrong to step in and save someone
as it would be to push someone off

WALLACE
You wouldnt push the guy would
you

GALE

I didnt say I thought we should
have saved him

WALLACE
You didnt

GALE
I said I wished it had at least
occurred to me to consider saving
him

DEAKINS
What good would that do

GALE sits on Deakins desk

GALE
It would make me feel like a human
being instead of a cynical
hardbitten newswoman Besides it
wouldnt be a bad story would it
Newswoman Saves Suicide

DEAKINS
Unprofessional

GALE

ugly scandal behind the falling
millionaire the dirt you mean

DEAKINS
That too

GALE
(to Wallace)
Would the station put me up ata

WALLACE
(a look toward Deakins)
Absolutely

GALE gives DEAKINS a big grin and starts out

DEAKINS
Okay hell with it Party hearty

something out
(once shes gone)
Shes just pretending shes a
person Shes really a reporter
Fifty bucks shes on the first
flight back

CHUCKY

get why a guy whos gonna jump asks
to talk to a TV reporter

DEAKINS
Cause hows he gonna know hes
jumped if its not on the six
oclock news

INT BALLROOM NY

VIGOROUS APPLAUSE
Award a tastefully

BERNIE has just shot himself in the

HOTEL - DAY

GALE has just received the Silver Mike
small mike-sized replica of a microphone

from the MASTER OF CEREMONIES Clutching it she faces the

applauding AUDIENCE
microphone

Thank you
for this

across a podium speaking into a real

GALE
very much Im grateful
Since youre all
colleagues here you know what kind
of a team it takes to put a story
on a screen I dont have to
explain to you how much the
cameraman the editor the
assignment editor and the news
director to mention a few did to
get me this award

GALE pauses She reaches into her purse and pulls out an onion
She holds it up

GALE

This is an onion

(dramatic pause

then)
Its a metaphor for a news story
Only a few hours ago I was standing
on a ledge sixty stories above a
street interviewing a man who
subsequently jumped to his death
Forty million dollars in the bank
happily married good health Great
story

The AUDIENCE is attentive mesmerized as they watch her rip off
the outer skin of the onion and toss it dramatically aside

GALE

(continuing)
Theres gotta be more Were pros
right Some kinda extramarital
hanky panky maybe Another good
story

(she peels another layer
of onion)
Maybe the guys been accused of
child molesting Terrific story

(she peels more off the
onion)
Then it turns out the accusation
was false Wonderful More story

The AUDIENCE watches captivated as the onion gets smaller

GALE

(continuing)
Maybe the alleged mistress was
lying setting the guy up
Sensational story

(the onion is very
small)
We keep going keep digging keep
investigating We expose the
guys whole life his family
Why Because were pros
Because

(she pauses
dramatically)
were looking for the truth

GALE considers the tiny remains of the onion in her hand
Then she peels it down to nothing and lets it fall

GALE
But what if after all our
digging after all our painstaking
investigation what if it turns out
there wasnt any truth Just
stories One story after another
one layer then another layer
until theres nothing left And
if its like that do we have any
obligation to stop at any point
Or do we just keep going digging
digging digging peeling
peeling peeling until weve
peeled it all away until weve
destroyed what we were
investigating in the first place

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE
attentive as GALE pauses dramatically then

GALE
Ill bet all of you like me
yearn for just one story that
isnt about uncovering layer after
layer of human weakness a story
that reveals with each new layer
of investigation something finer
and nobler something even
inspirational

GALE gazes soberly across the podium at the AUDIENCE

Im going to ask you to fasten your
seat belts while the Flight

procedures with you I apologize
for the necessity and the
inconvenience

Murmurs in the cabin What does this mean SUSAN looks a
question at GALE puzzled as Flight Attendants LESLIE and FREDDY
take their positions to demonstrate safety procedures

LESLIE
First make sure your seat belts are
fastened securely Then brace your
arms against the seat ahead at you

The engine struggles continues

BERNIE
Come on come on
The engine surges to life again then begins to throb with
downright vigor

BERNIE frowns Its getting louder
AND LOUDER AND LOUDER ITS ROARING

BERNIES eyes bug with the realization that either hes about
to take off OR THAT ISNT HIS ENGINE THUNDERING THUNDERING

A great shadow blurs in the rain ahead
BERNIE brakes hard skidding sliding wildly
BAWHOOOOOOOOM HUGE NOISE IMPACT GRINDING

BERNIE skids to a halt eyes shut tight to prevent himself from
dying

But hes not dead He opens his eyes Stares out the
windshield

A blank wall greets him bouncing back his headlights in a blur
of rain

BERNIE
Now what

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
BERNIE gets out of his car Everything is spooky quiet

The tail section of a huge aircraft blocks the road directly
in front of Bernies car He skidded to a stop two feet short
of ramming the twenty-five foot high vertical fin The rest
of the craft is sprawled off the low bridge and into the water
lost for the most part in the darkness

Suddenly a VOICE calls out from somewhere forward along the
fuselage

VOICE
Hey Help Somebody Help

BERNIE frowns Helping is not his instinct Approaching the
edge of the bridge he peers into the darkness

The plane is corkscrewed through the bridge at such a freak
angle that the tail rear doors are wedged shut by the metal
super-structure the wing exits are blocked by the up-bent wing
stubs and the right forward doors are canted hopelessly toward
the sky while the left exit is partially jammed in the mud near
the river bank in three feet of water

VOICE
Please Help us Were stuck
Hello Anybody

BERNIE
Whatsa problem pal

INT MAIN CABIN727 AT REST - NIGHT

Engulfed in darkness except for strings of floor lights leading
to the exits the cabin is a confusion of GROANS COUGHS CRIES
and the piercing WAIL of a screaming BABY The floor lights
seem to be on the walls high on one side and low on the other
as the cabin is dramatically canted making movement along
aisles nearly impossible

LESLIE battered from the impact her uniform torn is
struggling to open the forward emergency exit Angled downward
the door will only open six inches before being blocked by mud
Water pours in around her ankles as she shoves furiously

LESLIE
Somebody give me a hand

A VOICE
Were on fire

LESLIE
Lets stay calm everybody
Everybody stay calm please
Please stay calm Everything will
be all right if we stay calm
Somebody give me a hand with this
door

Her flashlight stabs the darkness reveals frightened FACES
Slumped motionless forms
LESLIE
Help the people around you

everybody Please help each other

AAAAAAAAAH SCREAMS as the plane suddenly shifts violently from
the interior movement canting further

ANGLE ON GALE

Staggering from her seat WHAM Hand luggage slams into her
from an overhead rack As GALE goes down a PASSENGER lands
on top of her catching her arm at an angle breaking it The
PASSENGER climbs off her and struggles down the slope

GALE realizes she cant get up her leg is wedged in the
framework of a seat PASSENGERS are climbing past her heading

forward

SUSAN is fighting her way out of her canted seats clutching
the terrified KELLY to her

GALE
I I cant move Im caught

SUSAN glances at her and their eyes meet KELLY is screaming
SUSAN turns away from GALE and half-carries KELLY toward the
exit leaving GALE alone trapped in pain and fear

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

BERNIE is climbing cautiously down the undercarriage of the

bridge toward the water as OTHER VOICES callout from the
twisted fuselage

BERNIE
Hold on there hold on there Just
a minute
BERNIE is awkward and very careful climbing down not

brave or dashing He doesnt notice that behind him where
the plane is corkscrewed through the bridge a BOUQUET OF ORANGE
FLAMES IS BLOSSOMING IN THE FUSELAGE OF THE JET

INT MAIN CABIN727 - NIGHT

Thick smoke is oozing through the cabin PASSENGERS are
stumbling over each other clogging the canted aisles while

in the darkness for a place to leave them

VOICE
Help us Help please

BERNIE
Hold on buddy I got hundred

dollar shoes here

More cries BERNIE steps cautiously into the water Up to his
ankles Deeper

BERNIE wades along the huge fuselage toward the VOICES
stumbling landing on all fours in the water

BERNIE
Jesus Christ

Struggling to his feet hands muddy he blunders toward the
Emergency Exit and finds it canted into the water jammed into
the mud so that it only opens a crack

MR BROWN is wedged in the crack trying to force the door open
without success Glimpsing BERNIES hands in the crack he
pleads

MR BROWN
Help us please We cant get out

BERNIE makes a tentative attempt to open the door He has no
effect whatsoever

MR BROWN
Push it You gotta push hard

BERNIE
Whaddaya (grunt) think Im (grunt)
doing

Reluctantly BERNIE digs his feet into the mud puts his shoulder
into the door and shoves with all his might Because he has a
better angle on the door and better purchase hes actually able
to move it several inches

MR BROWN
Harder Push it harder

BERNIE leans back into the door again and pushes with all his
might It gives ever so slightly Another inch MR BROWN
is trying to squeeze out

MR BROWN

BERNIE

MR BROWN

INT MAIN CABIN727 - NIGHT
PASSENGERS stumble over each other while a flashlight makes
panicky stabs at the darkness RICHIE cries out for FLETCHER
to wake up the BABY screams

Someones trying to get out the overhead exit others are
hammering at an aft exit

GALE slumped in her seat fades in and out of consciousness

Above her across the canted aisle SUSAN is calling out for

help Then GALES eyes flicker with awareness at the sound
of an urgent shout

VOICE
THERES A GUY OPENING THE DOOR
HES OPENING IT

A sudden shadowy surge of movement in the darkness PASSENGERS
urgently scrambling over seats toward the exit

EXT AIRPLANERIVER - NIGHT

BERNIE gives a great heave and goes down in the river face
first

Hes opened the door just wide enough for MR BROWN to squirm
through the narrow opening then pull MRS BROWN through

BERNIE sputtering is trying to get to his feet when the BROWNS
knock him down again in their frantic rush to get as far away
from the burning plane as they can

As BERNIE struggles to his feet yet again more PASSENGERS are
oozing out the door They brush him aside splashing toward the
river bank while orange flames are flickering wildly now in

the tail section

INT MAIN CABIN727 - NIGHT

LESLIE is beside the exit using her flashlight to guide people
Her face is bruised and bloody her uniform torn but she is

needs help

Scared PASSENGERS are struggling to get over the seats that are
close to where the floor ought to be

LESLIE
Please everybody one at a time

Just then the young RICHIE caught in the surge of PASSENGERS
bumps into her

RICHIE
Please Miss my father cant move

LESLIE grabs him and shoves him bodily out the narrow exit as
she speaks urgently

LESLIE
Well try and help him you wait

Just then LESLIE sees the bloody PILOT and CO-PILOT staggering
toward her

She helps them out the narrow opening half pushing them

A flashlight lies on the floor sending a useless knife of light
into the smoky darkness He grabs for it drops it urgently

BERNIE

and points it revealing FREDDY the other Flight Attendant

A MAN reluctantly turns and with the help of LESLIE they manage
to shove FREDDY out the exit LESLIE instructs the MAN

I asked John Bubber about the
Medal of Honor

BUBBERTV
As far as the medal goes well
that medals for something me and
my buddies did almost twenty years
ago in Viet Nam So if Im a war
hero today then I was a war hero
last week when I was selling cans
and sleeping in my car when I
didnt have a medal I dont think
a medal makes a hero You dont
need machinegun fire or burning
planes to be brave People do
heroic acts every day only theres
nobody around to take their picture
or decorate them Little things
can be heroic Helping someone
day in and day out giving up your
life a little every day instead
of all at once to help
Maybe maybe were all heroes

about

Yes everybody is in love with John

Bubber The whole country

in fact
And theyre not going to be happy
if he jumps to his death because
he was harassed by a lousy little
money-grubbing low-life fence

He had one tiny uncharacteristic
moment of weakness Thats not the

In all that smoke and fire John
had a moment of weakness Hed been
down and out destitute living in

stealing my purse

Swiped your purse While he was
saving you You gotta be kidding

GALE
(a triumphant 190k at
Bernie)
And sold it to Mister LaPlante the
fence whos now trying to blackmail
poor John

BERNIE is too stunned to speak

CHUCKY
Hes gotta be a nut He saves all
those people and swipes a purse

GALE

(emotional)
Because he was a real hero Chucky
He was acting out of a deep
instinctive decency not out of some
ego thing He didnt expect the
media to lionize him He didnt
expect a million dollar reward
He saved fifty-four people because
something inside him some
fundamental love for his fellow man
made him rush into that plane when
good sense told him otherwise
He was willing to settle for some
credit cards he sold to LaPlante

(to Bernie)
For how much LaPlante A couple
of bucks Did you give him enough
for a decent meal

BERNIE whos been listening to the description of his own deeds
with slack-jawed amazement is too taken aback to answer

The van zips past dark city streets populated by DERELICTS and
HOMELESS PEOPLE as GALE continues her emotional outpouring

GALE
All this is off the record Chucky
because if John Bubber lives Mister
LaPlante is going to give him his
assurance that there will be no more
misbehavior on his part Whats
more hes going to apologize

BERNIE
Im going to apologize to Bubber

GALE
I could deny I had those credit
cards on the plane with me
LaPlante
BERNIE
(amazed)
Lie you mean

GALE
Well maybe I wouldnt liebut
I could tell the story the way I
did just now so that people could
understand that John is even more
of a hero and that you
youre the lowest thing that ever
crawled Your name will be
synonymous with cynical opportunism
and blackmail You wont get a
cent

I remember when you were in the
hospital when you had the
appendicitis your father stayed
all night by your bed and he
hates hospitals always thinks hes
going to catch something and then
that time when your Uncle Howard
got hurt It seems like your
father is at his best in a crisis
when things go really wrong or
theres some kind of emergency your
father forgets to be Bernie LaPlante
and acts sort of like a human
being

tears in her eyes as she drives The RADIO continues
