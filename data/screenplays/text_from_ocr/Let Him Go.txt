INT BLACKLEDGE RANCH - BARN - PRE-DAWN 1

Horses stir and pace black silhouettes in dark stalls frail
morning aglow in the gaps between wall boards as a MAN
enters He murmurs in greeting and moves easily among them

A SERIES OF SHOTS The Man checks and feeds each animal
changes water examines saddles and tack the sounds of these
tasks alone punctuate the early hour’s church-quiet

EXT BLACKLEDGE RANCH - DAWN 2

The Man slides a rattling door open revealing himself fully -
JAMES BLACKLEDGE (late 20s work-strong determined but with
an open face quick to smile)- as he guides a glossy black
horse from the barn to a fenced ring under an empty sky

GEORGE BLACKLEDGE (60s straight-backed of few words but sly
humor with a perpetual squint from gauging great distances
weather and the character of other men) steps to the fence
as his son clicks his tongue and gets the animal moving

George watches the horse circle at the end of its lead
studying the animal as it canters past appraising nodding

GEORGE
Yep Yep

The sleek black creature throws off sparks as the sun crests
the soft far hills to light the horse ring with a gold fire

INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN 3

An egg yolk breaks and smears with a hiss in a hot pan and
LORNA (20s blinking and watchful bird-like) winces

Her eyes shoot from the egg she’s broken to MARGARET
BLACKLEDGE (still handsome over five decades in faintly
lined by a life under open skies a jut to her chin)
engrossed by paperwork at the table

Lorna shifts the INFANT BOY squirming in her arms and
surreptitiously flips the egg before Margaret can see just
as Margaret looks up from her work to the door opening

George and James enter on a trajectory for the large
farmhouse sink where they wash and dry their hands

MARGARET
How’s that black doing
GEORGE
Leg seems better Looking good

He helps himself to Margaret’s coffee as he takes a seat and
she nudges her plate of toast towards him with a smile

JAMES
Thinking I’d take him out to check
fence line after breakfast

LORNA
It’s almost ready

James spins the radio dial from cattle reports to George
Jones singing and dances across the room clowning to nuzzle
Lorna He snatches the baby launches it into the air

MARGARET
(laughing)
Careful
JAMES

Oh he likes it Don’t you Jimmy

He catches the happily gurgling baby tosses him up again

INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER 4
Lorna playfully rubs the baby’s tummy with her nose as she
undresses him on the drain board while water pours steaming
from the faucet to fill the giant white sink for a bath

MARGARET
Lorna This is too hot

Lorna glances over to find Margaret pulling her fingers from
the stream of water face creased with impatient concern

LORNA
Oh I know I didn’t-- Haven’t
checked it yet--

Margaret spins the cold water tap comes to tend the child

MARGARET
Here Let-- You rest

Lorna holds a beat weighing a response but then steps away
INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER 5
The baby stares up in mesmerized wonder at the shifting
patterns of shadow and light cast by the leaves of the yard’s
shade tree as Margaret soaps him in the giant white sink

MARGARET
What is it What do you see

The infant’s eyes roll and search until they finally come to
rest on Margaret His mouth twitches into a smile

MARGARET (CONTD)
Yes I’m right here Hello

The baby’s smile flickers and fades as he continues to stare
eyes locked on hers in a spell of deep penetrating inquiry

Margaret slows arrested by the steadiness of his gaze and
her own humming sense of profound communion

The baby’s expression screws down into a tight furious knot
He squeaks as he passes gas then relaxes again with a smile

Margaret laughs She cups water in her palm and sluices it
over his head a bit of suds running into the baby’s eyes

As he begins to fuss and cry movement beyond the window
snags Margaret’s attention and she glances out just as the
black horse James had trained earlier enters the yard alone

She watches the dark animal bring itself to a stop under the
shade tree where it stomps the ground and flags its tail

Margaret sees nothing but the empty saddle on its back

INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 6

Lorna looks up from reading Life magazine on the sofa when
Margaret hustles through with the wet crying baby

Margaret pushes out the screen door with a hip and dashes off
the porch The door springs back behind her with a slap

MARGARET (0S)
George George
EXT BLACKLEDGE RANCH - DAY 7
George shields his eyes against the sun as he steps from the

barn to look in the direction Margaret points running
towards him with the bawling baby He spots the black horse
He turns back to Margaret the urgency on her face then
drops the tools in his hands and breaks into a run

He crosses the yard in a bound seizes the horse’s trailing
reins and launches himself up into the empty saddle

GEORGE
Yah

He spurs the animal which takes off in the direction it had
come across the stretch of rolling fields beyond the fence

The screen door claps again and Lorna comes to join Margaret
who stands with the baby eyes pinned on George as he goes

LORNA
Where’s George going

Margaret shakes her head vacantly as Lorna tentatively
reaches to reclaim her baby to jiggle and soothe

LORNA (CONTD)
Shhh It’s okay It’s okay
(to Margaret)
Where’s James

Margaret opens her mouth but nothing comes out as the horse
carries George away from her over the edge of the world
INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 8

The shadows of bare branches ripple the blank wall reflected
in a bureau’s mirror a patch of hard winter sunlight

Margaret steps into the mirror’s frame

She checks herself a simple dark dress hair scraped back
She meets her own eyes at last and all the sadness there
She steels herself and applies a line of red lipstick

The floor creaks breaking the mournful quiet and she turns
to George who holds out two neckties one in each hand

Margaret chooses one loops it around George’s neck and
begins to form a knot She pauses wipes a dab of missed
shaving cream from his earlobe and returns to tying his tie

George watches his wife closely as she concentrates but she
avoids his gaze focusing on her task
INT COURTHOUSE - DAY 9

LORNA
I Lorna Blackledge

She stumbles slightly over the last name throwing a quick
nearly apologetic glance at George and Margaret standing
witness Margaret holds hands with JIMMY (now 3 years old)

LORNA (CONTD)
Take you Donnie--

She breaks off with a nervous laugh a cluster of white
flowers and holly trembling in her hands takes a breath

LORNA (CONTD)
Take you Donald Weboy to be my
lawfully wedded husband

DONNIE WEBOY (20s darkly handsome) gives her an encouraging
wink the two of them standing in their best clothes before a
JUDGE A portrait of President Kennedy hangs on the wall

JUDGE
To have and to hold From this day
forward For better for worse

LORNA
To have and to hold From this day
forward For better for worse

Jimmy watches all the adults George and Margaret stoically
enduring this ceremony with ramrod-straight backs

JUDGE
For richer for poorer In
sickness and in health

LORNA
For richer for poorer In
sickness and in health
JUDGE
Until death do us part

LORNA
(a breath)
Until death do us part

JUDGE
By the power vested in me by the
State of Montana I now pronounce
you man and wife You may kiss the
bride

Donnie turns to Lorna with a sexy teasing grin

DONNIE
Thank you sir I think I will

Margaret drops her eyes as Donnie kisses Lorna catches Jimmy
watching her She smiles thinly gives his hand a squeeze

George steps forward as the couple parts and offers his hand
to Donnie who makes a big show of respect looking George in
the eye nodding solemnly as he shakes his hand

Margaret meets Lorna stiffly patting at her without
embracing without meeting the girl’s searching expression

Lorna gives up and drops down to Jimmy’s level

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 10

Lorna throws her arms open to Jimmy who lets go of
Margaret’s hand to run to his mother in the snowy side yard

Lorna catches him up laughing and Margaret watches her
pepper the boy with kisses as feathery flakes swirl the air

George retrieves a box of Jimmy’s toys and a small cardboard
suitcase from the back of a parked station wagon

He turns for the ramshackle building and follows Margaret up
a peeling wooden exterior staircase behind Lorna and Jimmy
toward Donnie standing in an open second story doorway

INT LORNA AND DONNIE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 11

George sets the box of toys down in the all-but-empty living
room a couch a lamp chipped enamel-topped kitchen table

LORNA
We’ve got some more stuff coming
I put some chairs on lay-away

She gives an anxious tour of the few rooms wanting to impress
and George observes his wife take it all in without comment
INT LORNA AND DONNIE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 12
Lorna ratchets up her enthusiasm for Jimmy’s benefit as she

opens the door to a narrow room the only one freshly
painted A cowboy-theme blanket on a twin bed makes it nice

LORNA
And this is your room

Jimmy throws himself on the bed with delight and Lorna turns
to Margaret with a smile that goes unreturned

Margaret nods at the bare window overlooking the parking lot
MARGARET
We can sew you some curtains
EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 13

George looks on as Margaret clutches Jimmy to her in the yard
with Lorna and Donnie Margaret kisses the boy tenderly

MARGARET
(choked)
You’11 come visit soon

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY - (MOVING) 14

Margaret watches Jimmy waving her good-bye in her passenger
side mirror as George turns them out of the building’s lot

A last glimpse of the boy hand in the air beside his
mother Donnie already climbing the stairs Then they all
slide from the mirror and Margaret’s field of vision

She closes her eyes because there’s nothing left to see

INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 15

George enters to find Margaret standing motionless at the
sink staring out the window into the snowy yard

He leans a hip against the counter studying his wife
transfixed by the bare arms of the shade tree outside

He sees her chin begin to quiver
GEORGE
(quietly)
He isn’t far Just in town

Margaret angles her face away She won’t get caught crying

MARGARET
Fix you some lunch

She straightens up and steps away from the sink leaving
George alone to contemplate the white glowing porcelain as
dry and empty as the fields beyond the window

EXT GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY 16

Margaret steps out the door into bright summer sunshine
following a BAG BOY who carries her groceries to the car

cut TO
Margaret tips the boy with a couple dimes and a nickel

BAG BOY
Thank you Mrs Blackledge

He rattles the change in his palm as he lopes back to the
store and Margaret climbs behind that station wagon’s wheel
INT BLACKLEDGES CAREXT GROCERY - STREET - DAY 17
Margaret backs her car out from its space and navigates the
lot to the exit where she stops to wait for a break in the
cross street’s traffic She signals to turn

Her eyes flick to the far sidewalk as she scans the passing
cars and she spots Jimmy holding hands with Lorna walking

with Donnie each with an ice cream cone

Jimmy gives his scoop of ice cream a lick and it tumbles
from the cone landing on the sidewalk with a dull plop

MARGARET
Oh--

She sees Jimmy stop walking and abruptly drop Lorna’s hand

Lorna turns back to Jimmy who stares in forlorn confusion at
the lost ice cream at his feet the empty cone in his hand

Jimmy looks up at the sudden bark of Donnie’s laughter sees
he’s being laughed at and his own face caves in despair

Donnie impatiently grabs Jimmy by the arm to drag him along
but Jimmy digs in his heels yanks his arm free and--

Donnie’s hand lashes out quick as a striking snake He
slaps Margaret Blackledge’s grandson across the face

The boy’s sudden shock matches Margaret’s sitting helplessly
in the station wagon across the street She blinks

Jimmy bursts into hot tears

Lorna swoops down to comfort him but Donnie jerks her back
to her feet She tries squirming from his grip but Donnie
squeezes her upper arm and she twists in pain

Jimmy stops crying instantly seeing his mother struggle and
Donnie releases Lorna The three stand a breathless beat

Lorna scowls at Donnie then extends her ice cream to Jimmy
but Donnie swats her hand and the cone falls into the street

Margaret can’t hear from this distance but Lorna spits a few
choice words at Donnie who may be nodding his head tightly
but he’s not agreeing with anything she says He’s coiling

And then he springs He mashes his own ice cream in Jimmy’s
face surprising the boy who falls back on his butt

Lorna lunges at Donnie but he’s anticipated this and meets
her with a sharp slap across the face

Lorna’s hand goes to her cheek as Margaret’s hand flies to
the car’s horn just as another car sounds its horn

Margaret glances in the rearview mirror and sees a line of
three cars waiting directly behind her

She pulls out of the parking lot and quickly over to the
side but by the time she’s stopped and cranes around Jimmy
Lorna and Donnie are nowhere to be seen

INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 18
Two steaks sputter and pop in an iron pan

The back door opens and George enters in his work clothes
making a beeline for the sink where he washes his hands

dries them with a dish towel hanging there

He observes Margaret adding frosting to the top of a coffee
cake and smiles He dabs up a taste with a clean pinky

GEORGE
Mm

Margaret blocks him from taking more with her elbow

MARGARET
That’s not for you

INT BLACKLEDGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 19

George eyes Margaret as they eat their steaks at the table
Something’s going on but she’s keeping it to herself

GEORGE

something for Donnie next month

he glances at the coffee cake on the counter for a clue

Margaret checks herself in the rearview mirror then picks up
the coffee cake from the seat beside her opens the door
EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 21

Margaret knocks on the door at the top of the rickety stairs
and waits listening the coffee cake offering in her hands

She glances at the building’s small lot where trash blows
free then brings her attention back to this closed door

She knocks again with a frown

MARGARET
Hello lLorna

A dark window reflects morning sky on the other side of the
railing and Margaret leans out straining for a peek inside

WOMAN (0S)
Who you looking for

Margaret startles wheels about in surprise

WOMAN (0S) (CONTD)
You the girl’s mother

It takes Margaret a moment to locate the voice a WOMAN (40s
sallow) clutching a bathrobe closed tight at her neck in an
open doorway at the bottom of the stairs

MARGARET
No I’m her--

Margaret comes down the stairs and the woman retreats to
stand just inside her apartment door out of the light

MARGARET (CONTD)

She notices drawings scratched with a rock on the surface of
the cracked cement landing under her feet A child’s work

The clock on the wall ticks Ticks Ticks Ticks
The coffee cake minus one piece sits off to the side on the

PEOPLE heading home for supper or to the one movie house

They pass a liquor store and George spontaneously unhooks
Margaret’s arm from his and goes inside without a word

From out here her lips compressed into a straight line

resume walking as he unscrews the cap He offers it to her

MARGARET
Thank you No

George takes a nice pull and recaps the bottle

Gonna hide the evidence

He bends to slip the bottle of whiskey beneath the drivers
seat and meets something already hidden there

He pulls the heavy object wrapped in a dish towel from
beneath the seat and drops it on the upholstery with a thump

Margaret opens her mouth to speak but--

GEORGE (CONTD)
What the hell Margaret

He turns from the Colt service revolver on the car seat to
glare at his wife

GEORGE (CONTD)
What the hell

MARGARET
That was before I knew you were
coming-—

GEORGE

And you thought you’d need it

MARGARET
I didn’t want to find out I did and
not have it

roughly by the elbow angrily shaking her He pulls her with
him to the rear of the car

GEORGE (CONTD)
Was this going to be part of your
argument

MARGARET
George I would never--

GEORGE
It’s got bullets in it

He lets her elbow go still furious and opens the back gate
to pull out his suitcase He glances around to make sure no

searching the horizon He spurs the horse

EXT FENCELINE - DAY 46
George pulls up on the reins stopping the horse near a line
of fencing where James lies motionless across uneven rocks
beneath a cluster of cottonwood trees

George climbs down from the saddle

Eyes soft with pain he takes in the details of James’s body
boots tangled head turned on a neck broken where he fell

A buffeting wind crosses the fields and rustles the branches
of the trees overhead stirring James’s straw-colored hair

George picks up his son’s hat from the rocks

INT BENTROCK SHERIFF’S OFFICE - CELL - NIGHT 47

EXT FIELDS - DAY 49
George lifts his dead son’s body up in his arms

The horse shies when he approaches

GEORGE
Shh Shh S’okay boy

He lays James’s body across the saddle on the animal’s back

George’s worn fingers form knots with a soft rope tying the
body down He takes his time there’s no need to rush now

He cups the back of his son’s head with his hand when he’s
done and stands a silent beat eyes open

Then he secures James’s hat on the saddle’s horn and starts
to lead the black horse on the long walk for home

INT BENTROCK SHERIFF’S OFFICE - CELL - NIGHT 50

A bell clangs over the door as George and Margaret enter and
a YOUNG MAN (20s scrawny) looks up from behind the counter

MARGARET
Good morning

The Young Man nods tightly and Margaret pours on the
sunshine making a show of astonishment at the array of
saddles while George scans the shop’s layout

Margaret slips a wrist through the stirrup of one elaborately
hand-tooled saddle the new leather creaking loudly

MARGARET (CONTD)
Sounds like my knee in the morning
But beautiful saddles Wouldn’t
you say George

George doesn’t say as he takes up a tactical position just
inside the door where he can keep his eye on everything

YOUNG MAN
Fella in Miles City makes ‘em The
fancy ones

MARGARET
Very impressive
(smiling bigger)
But we’re not shopping for saddles
today Or bridles and bits

She advances on the Young Man who backs up a step behind the
display counter his eyes darting to George who allows
Margaret the stage

MARGARET (CONTD)
Now would you be a Weboy too

YOUNG MAN
No ma’am A cousin to Ima
Tucker

Closer now Margaret sees the freshly sewn welt puckered as
a mattress seam that runs throbbing-red down the Young Man’s
neck from one ear She blinks forces her eyes from it

MARGARET
Well we’re relations too then
Of a sort Donnie Weboy married
our daughter-in-law Former
daughter-in-law Which makes him
stepdaddy to our grandson

The Young Man cocks his head raw stitches straining

MARGARET (CONTD)
My husband and I found ourselves
over in this part of the state and
I said to him let’s look in on
Lorna and Donnie while we’re here
So here we are To see Donnie
Well really our grandson of
course but

YOUNG MAN
I don’t know no Donnie Or a Laura

MARGARET
Well I understood it’s why they
relocated here Donnie was going
to hire on at his uncle’s saddlery

YOUNG MAN
His uncle’s saddlery-- Who

MARGARET
George didn’t Lorna say

YOUNG MAN
You sure you don’t want Gladstone

GEORGE
Gladstone

The Young Man looks to George at the door nods

YOUNG MAN
North Dakota Just the other side
of the line Not that there’s work
there either No good work anyway
But they got a Weboy or two

MARGARET
Well maybe we should give there a
try Though I don’t know why Lorna
and Donnie would have been talking
up Forsyth like they did

Her eyes light on items under the counter’s display glass
blade-sharp spurs and knives skins snake rattles

YOUNG MAN
What was your names again

GEORGE
Any idea who we might ask to find
Donnie if we went to Gladstone
The Young Man reaches up a hand rakes his stitches itchy
YOUNG MAN
You let it be known you’re looking
for a Weboy they’1ll find you
EXT BADLANDS - DAY 52

An armada of mountain-high clouds sails the sky over the
endless bleak landscape in ringing silence

Light and shadow paint the land in undulating waves as a
faint droning growl pierces the vacuum growing until

George and Margaret’s car appears tiny in the distance

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY - (MOVING)EXT BADLANDS 53

Patsy Cline crackles and fades on the radio Margaret tries
to chase her on the dial but Patsy evaporates into static

Margaret fishes around as a sign flies past - WELCOME TO
NORTH DAKOTA and a VOICE suddenly leaps from the radio

VOICE (0S)

What you have done to your Christ

How you made him suffer Crucified
him Spilled his blood For your

sins--

George snaps the radio off

MARGARET
Goodness

GEORGE
Turn it back on if you want

MARGARET
I don’t want it either

She rearranges herself on the seat leans against the window

MARGARET (CONTD)
Sounds like your Daddy Thumping
his bible

GEORGE
Wasn’t just bibles he thumped

He scrolls his window down to let in a jet of air blowing a
fine grit of the pulverized land

EXT BADLANDS - DAY 54

A buffeting breeze reaches George and Margaret perched on a
mesa overlooking the distant small city of Gladstone a grid-
like concentration of buildings spread out as randomly as
buckshot across the desolate valley below

MARGARET
You’re with me on this right

GEORGE
I’m right behind you

His tone flat as the land before them turns Margaret from
the view to study her husbands profile

MARGARET
I don’t want you behind me George
I want to know you’re beside me

GEORGE
Who’s been doing the driving

MARGARET
You could say you want him back I
haven’t heard that yet

George turns now selects his words with great care coaxing
an animal in a direction it doesn’t wish to go

GEORGE
We’re not young Margaret

MARGARET
(laughs)
Well we’re not old

GEORGE
We’re not young

Margaret looks across the valley away from George who
clocks a slithering movement in the pebbled dust behind her

A black and tan snake oils a path for Margaret’s turned back

MARGARET
You saying you don’t miss him

George snatches the snake up and flings it away

GEORGE
I’m saying he’s not even in school
yet Years before he’ll read He
hasn’t had measles Or rode a
bike He’s young And we’re not

Margaret stands oblivious of having been saved from a snake
dusts the back of her pants

MARGARET
Well you can drive me into town
then Drop me off and turn around
take yourself back home I’11 do
what I need to do and take a bus
back to Dalton with Jimmy

GEORGE
Once Lorna’s handed him to you A
smile on her face happy as a clam
And if they’re not down there
What You gonna chase them around
the country on a bus

Margaret pulls a face

GEORGE (CONTD)
What if they go where Greyhound
doesn’t

MARGARET
Ill walk

GEORGE
(a resigned laugh)
You would too And when you
finally learn that what you want to
make happen isn’t going to happen
What then Margaret Meloy

MARGARET
I suppose I’1ll learn what I’ve
never been able to Isn’t that
what you’ve told me Over and
over That I don’t know when it’s
time to call it quits

George stands now shies a rock at the far distant town
GEORGE
Yep And I’ll be the one gets the
job of picking up those pieces
EXT BADLANDS - DAY 55

George and Margaret trudge back from their lookout as the sun
falls walking together but separate lots of space between

George spots the shape of a horse and then a MAN leading it
by his and Margaret’s car

He blinks Is it James His son A phantom Then he sees
that the Man is nosing around the parked car peering inside

GEORGE
Hey

Margaret looks up and sees the Man and horse too

GEORGE (CONTD)
The gun

They both break into a run and the Man jumps on his horse

GEORGE (CONTD)
Halt Right there

The Man throws up his hands astride the horse and Margaret
grabs the horse’s worn bridle while George goes for the car

MAN
Okay Okay I didn’t take
nothing I was just--

MARGARET
You were just what

Face to face Margaret now sees the Man for what he is
barely twenty Native American more skittish than his horse

MAN
Fishing

GEORGE
Fishing around this car

MAN
No sir I’m coming from fishing

He indicates the rod tied to his horse pulls a bundle of
fish from a tackle box as George joins them

MAN (CONTD)
I just seen your car and was
wondering who’s setting up camp out
here That’s all

GEORGE
And who are you

MAN
Peter Dragswolf sir I live over
there Have my own place

He lifts his chin to the other side of a rise

PETER
I’ve got my own money too I
don’t need none of your goods

Margaret strokes his horse’s long nose the animal’s quiet
ease rendering a verdict for her on Peter himself She
flicks a glance at George then extends a hand to Peter

MARGARET
I’m Margaret Blackledge Mr
Dragswolf This is my husband
George Sorry if we’re trespassing

PETER
Where you’re standing’s as much
yours as mine

MARGARET
And what’s this girl’s name

PETER
Cant say She don’t belong to me
But I call her Silverflower

Margaret regards the horse warmly like an old friend

GEORGE
How’d you come by her

PETER
She come by me Showed up outside
my shack one morning Out of the
snow last February Thought she
was wild at first but
(shrugs )

She came from somewhere I don’t
know But she found me

MARGARET
Same as us

EXT BADLANDS - SUNSET 56

The horse’s pounding hoofs churn up dust as she gallops
hanging a gossamer contrail bright as flame behind her in the
evening air lit by the lowering sun as it settles

The horse rockets forward arrow-straight neck lunging
surrendered to Margaret on her back and the joy of motion

Margaret suddenly pulls the reins hard to the right and the
horse follows easy wheeling around and Margaret whoops

George sits with Peter on the hood of the car watching
Margaret turn the horse again and spur the animal

PETER
Maybe the horse belongs to her

GEORGE
Near about every horse does

Margaret sails past all-but-standing in the saddle as the
horse reaches speed legs a blur

cut TO
Margaret dances the horse through various walks turns and

tricks the two in natural rhythm and George tracks his wife
becoming easier more fluid as she remembers an old self

57 EXT BADLANDS - DUSK 57

MARGARET
I used to ride

Peter watches his fish roast over a fire as Margaret prepares
a meal and George finishes pitching his and Margaret’s tent
the lights of Gladstone peppering the distant valley floor

GEORGE
She’s being modest with you

MARGARET
I used to break horses Along with
our son James Then he died And
I guess I lost my appetite for it

George stops working watches his wife stare into the fire a
thoughtful beat then she looks to the horse tied to the car

MARGARET (CONTD)
Havent kept animals for a while
It’s nice to spend time with a
sweet one like your girl there

PETER
I’m sorry About your son

George comes to join Peter and Margaret at the fire

GEORGE
What about you How long you been
out here

PETER
Three years

MARGARET
All on your own No family

Peter shrugs circumspect

GEORGE
Where were you before

PETER
(vaguely)
Indian school sir

GEORGE
You don’t have to call me sir
George’1ll do the job

MARGARET
You finished that school How old
are you

Peter stands abruptly stepping toward the horse escape

PETER
I don’t bother anybody If
somebody comes for the horse they
can have her back The skins I
sell those are animals I catch
The fish are free I don’t steal
I mind my own business

George and Margaret don’t even look at one another neither
moving as Peter remains standing uncertainly ready to flee

GEORGE
That’s a good business Sit

Margaret portions food onto three tin plates

MARGARET
Peter Come eat what you caught

Slowly he returns to accept the plate she offers

PETER
Thank you

MARGARET
Thank you

She passes a plate to George as Peter sits and they eat

GEORGE
You’re familiar with the area
though Gladstone

PETER
I can tell you where the folks are
buried that ain’t buried in the
cemeteries

GEORGE
Weboys

Peter stops chewing swallows

GEORGE (CONTD)
You had any dealings with them

PETER
I go careful through life so I
don’t have dealings with Weboys

George and Margaret exchange a glance

MARGARET
We’re looking for our grandson
Our boy’s boy

GEORGE
He’s with a man named Donnie Weboy
You ever heard of him

PETER
No But if you’re looking in
Gladstone look for Bill Weboy

GEORGE
You think he’d help us

PETER
Help Maybe But Go careful
EXT BADLANDS - NIGHT 58

Margaret wraps the last of her coffee cake in a dish towel
and gives it to Peter as he climbs up and sits in his saddle

He shakes hands with the Blackledges and turns the horse for
the near hills

Together George and Margaret watch after the horse and rider
as they cross the rocky land beneath a dense river of stars
and vanish over a ridge

EXT GLADSTONE - STREET - DAY 59

The Blackledge’s car rolls slowly down a raw-looking street
in the shadow of Gladstone’s water tower

A tall MAN rakes leaves from the gutter into the road up

ahead in front of an unadorned house painted mint green

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY - (MOVING) 60

George and Margaret scrutinize houses as they drive
MARGARET

That’s got to be it Only green
house on the street

George pulls to the curb and the Man (40s strangely handsome
despite a shattered nose) lines himself up with the center of
their car’s hood and leans on his rake staring with a grin

George’s brow furrows but Margaret’s quick out of the car

EXT BILL’S HOUSE - DAY 61

MARGARET
Mr Weboy

MAN
Who’s asking

George steps from the car taking measure of this Man as
Margaret goes to offer her hand and shake

MARGARET
Margaret Blackledge And my
husband George If you’re a
Weboy were family After a
fashion

MAN
How you figure that

The Man shakes George’s hand as he joins them but his focus
is wholly on Margaret as he unfolds a smile

BILL
Bill Weboy A cousin are you

MARGARET
Could be But probably not
exactly Our former daughter-in-
law married a Donnie Weboy He’s
step-dad to our grandson now
That’s pretty tangled up isn’t it

BILL
Like family usually is

GEORGE
We heard they might have come to
settle here in Gladstone

MARGARET
We wanted to pay a visit See our
grandson Jimmy Since we were in
the neighborhood

BILL
Since you’re in the neighborhood
And since you didn’t find them up
in Forsyth

George eyes Bill narrowly while Margaret turns up the dial on
her smile

MARGARET
You heard we were coming did you

BILL
Oh I did I did A little birdie
flew over here ahead of you

He pinches the air to make a bird’s beak

BILL (CONTD)
Cheep Cheep Cheep

GEORGE
(enough with this guy)
Are they here or not

Margaret shoots George a sharp look and Bill hooks a thumb

BILL
Is he always like this Big hurry

MARGARET
My husband likes to get down to
business

BILL

A hell of a lot of men are like
that Can’t wait to get to where
they’re going Women in my
experience would as soon take
their time

(winks at Margaret)
Enjoy the ride so to speak--

GEORGE
Mr Weboy I’m going to tell you--

BILL
Oh they’re here I’m just funnin’
you George Donnie’s my nephew
They’re safe and sound out at his
mom’s place Why don’t we all go
inside and give the old homestead a
call See if anybody’s at home

(MORE )

BILL (CONTD)
Hell maybe you can drive out there
this morning and see that precious
grandson of yours

MARGARET
He is that to us Mr Weboy

BILL
Doesn’t even need to be said

He starts for the house flinging the rake onto the scorched
patch of earth that passes for a yard Margaret looks to
George who lifts his chin let’s get this done

INT BILL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 62
BILL
Had your coffee yet I could puta
pot on

Bill pauses in the center of the room as they follow him in

MARGARET
Were fine Thank you

BILL
Well make yourself at home I’11
make that call See what their
schedule is like

He exits for the kitchen and Margaret survey’s the home
spare as a furniture store not one sign of hobby or habit

George hears the heavy rattle and clunk of a wall phone’s
handset as it’s lifted from its cradle in the kitchen

BILL (0S) (CONTD)
Hey Mabel Can you connect me
with the ranch

Margaret takes a seat on the davenport and George sits beside
her alert his ear cocked toward the kitchen

MARGARET
What What is it

George gives his head a tight shake

BILL (0S)
Blanche It’s Bill

MARGARET
What

GEORGE
(quietly)
You don’t want this man’s help

MARGARET
We can’t do this on our own

George turns slowly to his wife but then there’s the clatter
of the telephone again and Bill suddenly enters the room

BILL
You two have plans for supper

MARGARET
(impulsively)
We surely don’t

George fixes Margaret with a look

BILL
How would you like to be the guests
of the Weboy clan out at the ranch

Margaret hesitates deferring now to George

GEORGE
We don’t want to be any trouble

BILL
No trouble at all My sister-in-
law wants to meet you Says you
all can swap grandma-and-grandpa
stories And just between me and
you she’s a hell of a cook

Margaret turns to look at George as she addresses Bill

MARGARET
You’d have to give us directions

BILL
Nope Not a chance I could be
the best damn direction-giver in
the world and you still wouldn’t
find it You’d be out there
wanderin’ all over Four Bridges
Road and never see a one No You
make your way back here at four
o’clock and you can follow me

The sun ducks behind a cloud and the room irises dim

Not one of the three people moves Then the sun reemerges
the room flares bright and Margaret gets to her feet

MARGARET
Thank you We’ll come back then

EXT BILL’S HOUSE - DAY 63
George takes Margaret’s elbow as they walk towards their car

She glances at him but George isn’t looking at her He’s
scrutinizing the line of wires that run overhead pole to
pole down the street bypassing the house they just left

George gets Margaret in the car and takes a furtive look back
at Bill’s house as he goes around but the dark windows make
it impossible to tell if anyone’s watching from inside

EXT SCHOOL - GLADSTONE - DAY 64
The empty seats of children’s swings sway on rusty chains

George idly eyes a CLUSTER OF YOUNG BOYS lighting matches in
boredom and mischief in the distance as he eats a sandwich
seated beside Margaret on a cracked wooden bench overlooking
the school’s bone-dry playground He checks his watch

MARGARET
Time is it

GEORGE
I’m thinking I should find a phone
booth give Jack Nevelson a call
See what he might know about your
friend Bill Weboy

MARGARET
What’s there to know

GEORGE
How he managed to make that call
when there’s no phone wire to his
house For starters

He fishes the bottle of whiskey from his pocket and Margaret
looks elsewhere as he takes a sip

MARGARET
I thought you were done with that

GEORGE
There’s a lot I thought I was done
with

Margaret’s head swivels to look at George askance but he
stands tucks the bottle and jerks his chin towards town

GEORGE (CONTD)
Come on Let’s scout a hotel for
tonight

MARGARET
Hotel We’re heading home tonight
I don’t need to stay a second
longer than I have to in this
place thank you very much
(decisively)
We get Jimmy we start driving

George laughs an astonished exhale and shakes his head

GEORGE
Now there’s something you do
Count a thing done because you want
it so

Margaret surveys the withered houses that ring the school

MARGARET
Youve walked through Gladstone
now Seen this town same as me
Tell me what there is here for a
boy

GEORGE
Id think you’d be able to answer
that for yourself easy enough

MARGARET
Help me--

GEORGE
His mother Margaret

Margaret stops looks up at George flatly a long beat
GEORGE (CONTD)
Open your eyes honey See what’s
in front of you

Margaret looks away

GEORGE (CONTD)
You’re not going to get him back

Margaret shakes her head and folds the rest of her sandwich
away in its paper for something to do then she stands

She avoids George’s eye as she angles around him and heads
for their car

GEORGE (CONTD)
Can’t leave me here I’ve got the
keys

EXT BILL’S HOUSE - DAY 65

The rake still lays in Bill’s yard right where he’d thrown
it when George and Margaret pull up out front

Bill emerges from a truck parked alongside his house and
ambles to the passenger window as Margaret rolls it down

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY 66

BILL
About time

He flashes a smile and leans low to the window

BILL (CONTD)
One of you should ride with me and
the other follow I can tell you
where we’re going and why and that
way maybe you can find your way
back on your own

He turns without waiting and starts away back to the truck
spinning his keys on a finger

Margaret looks to George who shakes his head watching Bill
go She reaches for her door handle

GEORGE
Where do you think you’re going

MARGARET
You think he wants you in the
passenger seat

GEORGE
(a sour laugh)
No I know he doesn’t

They watch Bill climb into his truck see him reach across
and swing the passenger door open

GEORGE (CONTD)
I don’t care what he wants I’m
going you drive

Margaret opens her door

MARGARET
It’s fine George

He grabs for her arm but she slips from the car snatching
up the old stuffed toy horse from the back seat as she goes

GEORGE
Margaret get back in--

MARGARET

Follow close
EXT BILL’S HOUSE - DAY 67
Margaret shuts her car door and walks across the dirt yard
Not one other thing in the world moves not a leaf not Bill
in the truck’s cab or George watching her from their car
INT BLACKLEDGE’S CAR - DAY 68
George grips the wheel a hawk on its a perch

He sees Margaret arrive at the truck’s open door She
glances back at him for the briefest moment then climbs up

GEORGE
(a muttered curse)
God bless it

Margaret pulls the truck’s door closed behind her SLAM

EXT HIGHWAY - GLADSTONE - DAY 69
Bill’s truck rips down the knife-straight blacktop heading
out of Gladstone George’s car right behind the land on
either side flat as still water

INT BLACKLEDGE’S CAR - DAY - (MOVING) 70

George drives eyes locked on Bill’s truck in front of him

INT BILL’S TRUCK - DAY - (MOVING) 71

Margaret sits rigidly keeping her eyes on the road ahead
though she’s fixed on tracking Bill peripherally alert

Bill’s eyes move from the toy horse Margaret holds in her lap
to explore the curve of her hip her breast He flicks his
eyes to George following in the rearview mirror

BILL
Pretty bird that old jalopy won’t
have trouble keeping up will it

MARGARET
You’re looking in the mirror often
enough You know where he is

BILL
I guess he don’t want you to get
too far out of his sight Which I
understand

He pulls a White Owl cigar from his shirt pocket

BILL (CONTD)
You mind

MARGARET
Your car You don’t need my
permission

BILL

You strike me as the kind of woman
aman is always asking permission
of Or excusing himself to

MARGARET
An expert are you On kinds of
women

BILL

I’ve been around more than a few
women who want men to ask before
drawing a breath

MARGARET
Well Air is free Mr Weboy And
so are men

BILL
You and I got a lot in common

Margaret turns sharply to look at him and Bill meets her
with a sly wink and grin as he lights his cigar

BILL (CONTD)
Seems you’re an expert too

Margaret cranks her window down an inch to let the smoke out

MARGARET
And Mrs Weboy I’11 bet she’s an
expert

BILL

Blanche Donnie’s mom

MARGARET
I meant your wife

Bill draws deeply on his cigar fills the car as he exhales

BILL
You saw my place how tidy it is
Used to be a regular pigsty Or so
my wife called it Sniped away at

me for years “I’m sick of
cleaning up after you” “Just
leave it” I’d say “Who gives a

damn” Oh we’d go round and
round Then her mother took sick
and Clara-- that was my wife--

Off to Idaho To take care of her
“Im leaving this house clean and I
don’t want to find it any different
when I come back” Ha I tore the
place apart Every room right
down to the lath Opened it up
real good Me a claw hammer and
Mr Jack Daniels Well Clara
comes back the sight of the place
scares the hell out of her She
saw to it I was locked up For
destroying something that belonged
to me if you can imagine She
cleared out while I was behind
bars Left me nothing but a bowl
a spoon and a house without walls

He checks Margaret can tell she’s listening but she keeps
looking straight ahead

BILL (CONTD)
I put that house back together
You saw it walls just where
they’re supposed to be Plastered
and painted The hell of it was
once I finished the place I was
finished with her Now that house
ain’t ever anything but neat as a
pin just the way Clara would like
it Except she’s never setting
foot inside again

Margaret denies Bill a reaction when he looks to her again
He grinds out his cigar and they ride on in prickly silence

BILL (CONTD)
We turn here

MARGARET
Why don’t you signal instead of
telling me so George knows what’s
coming

Bill turns a smirking smile on Margaret

BILL
Aye aye cCap’n

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY - (MOVING) 72

George explicates where an unmarked road ahead will meet the
highway so he’s ready when Bill signals at the last possible
second before swinging the truck from the blacktop onto dirt

George spins the car’s wheel makes the sharp turn and rocks
and gravel explode beneath the vehicle as it leaves the
pavement to follow in the truck’s billowing wake

INT BILL’S TRUCK - DAY - (MOVING) 73

Margaret grips the armrest on the door out of Bill’s sight as
he speeds them along the rutted trail She tries to keep an
eye on George obscured by dust in her side mirror

MARGARET
How much further is it

BILL
You mean how much more of me do you
have to put up with

MARGARET
(trying for lightness)
I-- We just want to see Jimmy

BILL
(not buying it)
Yeah Fine-looking boy there And
his mother is a good-looking woman
You know Donnie never asked me for
a word of advice in his life--

MARGARET
(laughs despite herself)
Is that so

BILL
But if he had I might’ve told him
to do exactly as he’s done “Marry

yourself a widow Donnie You’ll
be getting a grateful woman”

He bounces his eyebrows at Margaret when she looks at him

MARGARET
You could slow down

BILL
But then it’d be longer until you
see your grandson

EXT BADLANDS - DAY 74
Dark clouds hang heavy with rain at the horizon sheering the
rays of the lowering sun as George’s car keeps pace through
every hard climb steep descent and sudden curve with Bill’s
truck as it leads him further and further from Gladstone
INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY - (MOVING) 75
George never blinks keeping his eyes fixed on Margaret in
the truck in front of him using her silhouette to steer by
EXT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - SUNSET 76
The carcasses of vehicles litter the property as though
they’d tried to crawl on rusted rims to reach the brittle two-

story Victorian farmhouse in the middle of nowhere and died

George’s car passes the wrecks as it follows Bill’s truck
through an open gate and circles to the back of the house

Margaret is out of Bill’s truck before he kills the engine
Bill takes his time sliding out saluting George as George
moves quickly to meet Margaret with an unspoken exchange
with mere looks Are you okay Yes
Thunder rumbles deep in the distant dark clouds

BILL

Never be able to find this on your
own Was I right

George ignores Bill who laughing shakes his head as he
leads the way past a tree from which an engine block swings
on a creaking rope over the open hood of ruined car

George tracks the hammering and clanging coming from a nearby
shed as he and Margaret climb the worn steps of the house’s
sagging enclosed porch Bill holding open the screen door

BILL (CONTD)
After you

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - BACK PORCH - DUSK 77

George and Margaret navigate a path ahead of Bill through a
clutter of shotguns boxes of shells snow shovels boots
cans of kerosene tumbling piles of firewood farm
catalogues and broken jars of nails to reach the house door

BILL
Blanche

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN - DUSK 78

The Blackledges step into the semi-dark room similar in
shape to their own kitchen yet different in every other way

A thin haze smudges the air from cook smoke or the cigarette
burning in an ashtray on the table over which a lamp hangs
low casting the only light in the apparently empty room

BILL
We’re here

Bill enters behind George and Margaret who have stopped
BILL (CONTD)
(calling into the house)

Blanche

A slender white hand floats down to take up the burning
cigarette on the table and lift it from the pool of light

Only now is it clear that a WOMAN stands directly in front of
them though on the far side of the table her dress blending
into the background her head obscured by the hanging lamp

They hear her inhale on the cigarette see the exhaled smoke

Then she leans down bringing her face into the lamp’s light

BLANCHE WEBOY’s smile stretches over fifty years from one ear
to the other but there’s nothing friendly in all that span
A fuss of makeup undermines her striking natural beauty

BLANCHE
I hope you like pork chops

George squints getting a bead on this woman as Margaret
rounds half the table stretching out her hand to her

MARGARET
My mouth’s watering already

BLANCHE
Youre the grandma

MARGARET
Iam Margaret Blackledge

Blanche looks at Margaret’s hand before she shakes it clocks
the stuffed horse in Margaret’s other hand

BLANCHE
Blanche Weboy

MARGARET
Thank you for having us

Blanche rotates her head in George’s direction

BLANCHE
And you’re the lawman

GEORGE
Retired ma’am George Blackledge

He goes and shakes the hand she trails in the air before him

BLANCHE
Well why don’t we all retire toa
seat at the table Shall we

Bill double-times it to pull out a chair for Blanche taking
the seat beside her as she sits George and Margaret seat
themselves opposite empty chairs separating the two couples

Margaret rests the toy horse on the table set for dinner and
Blanche picks up an open bottle of wine already there

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Now who can I interest in a glass

MARGARET
No thank you

Blanche looks to George who shakes his head She shrugs and
refills the jelly glass in front of her

BLANCHE
Well I don’t mind drinking alone

She takes a long sip stubs out her cigarette

and died right where she stood
not thirty feet from that back
door Hard life And not for
everyone My other brothers and
sister lit out as soon as they
could never looked back I stayed

Thunder crashes overhead startling everyone at the table
with its nearness Blanche lifts her eyebrows laughs

BLANCHE (CONTD)
When I first met Henry Weboy he
couldn’t stop talking about heading
for Florida I figure I had more
than a little to do with his
decision to stay Now he’s buried
in the same cemetery as my folks
and his And my boys are fourth
generation Weboys and Gannons born
and living on North Dakota soil

Thunder rolls low as George watches Bill drape an arm across
the back of Blanche’s chair intimate

Blanche slides her gaze to George then Margaret

BLANCHE (CONTD)
But you didn’t come to hear me
yak You came to eat Bill why
don’t you call the boys for supper

Bill jumps up and goes out the way they came in and Blanche
moves to the oven to pull out a pan of charred chops

BLANCHE (CONTD)
I suppose you could tell a story
not a hell of a lot different from
mine Am I right About family
Hardships

Neither George nor Margaret answer and Blanche turns to catch
them glancing about for any sign of their grandchild

Bill returns trailed by TWO MEN (30s nearly identical both
enormously tall and hulking in grease-stained coveralls)

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Meet the boys Tall one’s Elton
and the other’s Marvin
(to her sons)
Say hello to our guests

The brothers grab cans of beer from the refrigerator with oil-
black hands pop them open using a church-key on a string

ELTON
That your wagon out there

MARVIN
We tried to get inside Take a
look

ELTON

Tighten a couple bolts we could
probably get you a few more horses

George ignores both sons as he slowly stands up to his full
height

GEORGE
Where’s Jimmy Where’s the boy

Blanche leans against the counter lights another cigarette

BLANCHE
Why he’s not here He’s with his
daddy

MARGARET

His father--
George quiets Margaret with a staying gesture of his hand

GEORGE
We came here to see our grandson

BLANCHE
You mean you didn’t come here to
eat my pork chops

The Weboy men join Blanche in a laugh

GEORGE
If you brought us all the way out
here for the sake of a joke

BLANCHE
Lorna said you were rough bark

She points her cigarette at Margaret

BLANCHE (CONTD)
And I can see already you’re no day
at the races No ma’am

She brings the pan to the table where Elton and Marvin grab
seats and she forks chops onto each person’s plate She
gestures for George to sit again

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Your grandson’s with my Donnie He
took Jimmy along to pick up the
boy’s mother from work

MARGARET
Lorna

BILL
She’s working at Monkey Ward

MARGARET
In Gladstone We could’ve seen
Lorna and Jimmy in Gladstone

BLANCHE
Now I am feeling insulted by you
You really don’t give a damn about
sharing a meal

MARGARET
(dialing herself back)
I just meant--

BLANCHE
Maybe you’re a Jew Maybe you
can’t eat pork chops

Margaret looks to George who regards Blanche unflinchingly
from the far side of the table Thunder rumbles outside

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Oh breathe easy Anyone who knows
me knows I can’t be insulted Eat
my chops or don’t

Her sons eat her chops They gobble them up seemingly
oblivious to the tension at the table

MARGARET
Wed certainly hoped to meet
Donnie’s family someday

BLANCHE
Had you Well I’m glad to learn
it I thought we should meet too
Have ourselves a chat It would
have been nice if it was at the
wedding But maybe that was too
much to ask For his mother to be
invited Or his brothers

BILL
His poor Uncle Bill

Margaret looks to George again then back at Blanche

MARGARET
You weren’t invited He didn’t--

BLANCHE
You recollect seeing us there

Margaret blinks at the heat and absurdity of Blanche’s blame

MARGARET
And that’s our fault

BLANCHE
You didn’t stop and think to
yourselves he must have come from
somewhere Must have family

MARGARET
Frankly we thought only that
Donnie was a grown man

Blanche studies Margaret a long measuring beat

BLANCHE
Your son’s dead

She blows smoke into the center of the table

BLANCHE (CONTD)
It’s understandable you forget
We’re never really done raising
them Teaching them the right way
Why I had to bring my boy home
where I can keep an eye on him

George watches his wife as Blanche stubs out her cigarette

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Your boy’s perfect now Not really
fair to compare him and Donnie

MARGARET
I wouldn’t ever compare Donnie to
our son

Blanche’s smile stretches unnaturally Cheshire cat-wide

BLANCHE
He says you two don’t approve

GEORGE
I’m surprised to hear he gives a
damn what we think He couldn’t be
bothered to let us know they were
leaving

Blanche looks at George in surprise he’s been so quiet

BLANCHE
My boy doesn’t have to answer to
you

GEORGE

(almost a laugh)
No He does not

MARGARET
And we don’t have to answer to you

Blanche’s eyes go wide turning to Margaret and she brings
both hands slapping down on the table with a high hoot

BLANCHE
Hoo We better get some food in our
bellies before this get-together
turns into a real blood feud

BILL
And we’ve got numbers on you

A car’s headlight’s sweep the room

BLANCHE
Why here come the newlyweds now

Everyone falls silent waiting listening for the slam of car
doors that finally comes Footfalls sound on the porch and
Lorna and Donnie’s voices pitched in hushed squabbling

Donnie enters the room first scanning all the faces turned
in his direction He reaches reflexively for his hat’s brim
on seeing George a tell of deference as he removes it

Blanche’s eyes twitch in tracking this signal of respect from
Donnie to this retired sheriff who merely nods at her son

Donnie steps aside to reveal Lorna frazzled after a work
day in a blouse and skirt a size too big Jimmy on her hip

GEORGE
Lorna

Lorna glances around the Blackledge’s car outside and her
former-in-laws in here are all apparently fresh news to her

Margaret has eyes only for her grandson softening completely
at the sight of him a naked longing opening her face

MARGARET
Hello Jimmy

George sees the boy’s head snap in his grandmothers
direction recognition flaring bright in Jimmy’s eyes

Then the child glances furtively at Donnie Blanche the
other men in the room and he pops a thumb in his mouth

BLANCHE
Uhn-uhn

She hastily snatches his thumb out
BLANCHE (CONTD)
Am I right Sure way to end up
with buck teeth

Margaret rises from the table and walks to the boy her arms
floating out in front of her extending reaching

MARGARET
May I

George watches Jimmy fall into Margarets arms wrap his arms
around her neck and bury his face an animal hiding

He sees his wife’s eyes fill as she presses her nose to the
boys skull his hair breathing him in deeply

She kisses the top of the boy’s head and he squeezes her

Lorna looks to Blanche who observes this reunion with a mask-
blank face then turns back to Margaret laughs nervously

LORNA
He’s turning into quite a load

DONNIE
I told you you pick him up too
much How’s he supposed to learn

LORNA
Learn what How to walk He knows
how to walk

DONNIE

Hell I’d probably unlearn how
myself if someone carried me
everywhere I wanted to go That’s
flat-out spoiling him

Margaret hefts the child in her arms thinner than he was

MARGARET
He weighs nothing

BLANCHE
Has he eaten

DONNIE
I got him a burger at Ressler’s
while we were waiting

BLANCHE
And did he eat it

DONNIE
Half

BLANCHE
Does he want a pork chop Some
potatoes
She tugs at Jimmy’s trailing foot
BLANCHE (CONTD)
Do you Can I cut up a little meat

for you

Jimmy wont lift his head from Margaret’s shoulder

JIMMY
No
Blanche yanks harder on the toe of his shoe
BLANCHE
What’s that What are you supposed
to say

He rolls his face away from Blanche and into Margaret’s neck

JIMMY
No thank you

Blanche lets go of his foot and looks to Lorna

BLANCHE
Take him up to bed then

George clenches his jaw bracing

MARGARET
What

Lorna doesn’t move but looks between the two women

MARGARET (CONTD)

We just-- He just got here
BLANCHE

We believe in early-to-bed in this

house

She pats Jimmy’s bottom in Margaret’s arms
BLANCHE (CONTD)
And we believe in walking up stairs
on our own two feet

Margaret backs away from Blanche tightening her hold on
Jimmy as her eyes dart from one Weboy to the next

Bill strolls to stand in front of the back door
BILL
Easy now Grandma You know who
makes the rules around here

George’s chair scrapes the floor as he stands abruptly

Marvin pushes away from the table at the same time but
remains in his chair hands on his knees ready

A crack of thunder pins everyone in place Margaret clutching
the blinking child the men cocked and tensed Blanche turned
casually toward the counter and Lorna stuck in the middle

Thunder booms again with a crackling tail then a hush
Finally the hiss and patter of falling rain fills the room

Elton spears another pork chop Marvin takes a sip of beer
Donnie rolls his shoulder And Bill slowly unwraps a cigar
Each Weboy man makes himself known one way or another

Margaret looks to George He meets her desolate gaze nods

She holds then slowly bends down and sets Jimmy on his feet
The boy looks up at her in bewilderment Abandoned

JIMMY
There was mustard

MARGARET
On your hamburger

Jimmy bobs his head and Margaret follows his gaze to the toy
horse as he spies it on the table Margaret picks up the
horse extends the old toy towards her grandson

MARGARET (CONTD)
You don’t like mustard do you

He wags his head forlornly as he reaches for the horse but
Blanche claps her hands and the boy flinches at the sound

BLANCHE
Off you go Up the stairs

MARGARET
Please

BLANCHE
Now that you know where to find us
youll have to visit more often

Donnie gives Lorna a shove and she lurches forward reaches
down to take her son’s hand

LORNA
Come on Jimmy

The boy slips his hand into hers and lets himself be led
towards the dark mouth of a back staircase

Margaret reflexively follows pulled as by a magnet still
holding the stuffed horse in her hand

MARGARET
Please

GEORGE
That’s enough

He moves quickly to Margaret’s side encircling her shoulders
with his arm either to support or restrain her

GEORGE (CONTD)
Enough

Jimmy looks back at his grandparents from the stairwell then
matches his steps to Lorna’s as they climb out of sight

GEORGE (CONTD)
(whispers to Margaret)
Don’t beg

The stuffed horse slips from Margaret’s hand as George steers
her now towards the door

GEORGE (CONTD)
We thank you but we’1ll be on our
way

Blanche scoops the horse up from the floor and holds it out
but George has already maneuvered Margaret out the door

BLANCHE
Well I guess we know who matters
to you You’re rushing off before
the pie But if you have to go
you have to go

George hustles Margaret through the labyrinth of junk
kindling and spare parts the tin roof ticking with rain

Hey Blackledges
EXT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - NIGHT 80

BILL
Hold up there

Bill appears on the porch behind them as George and Margaret
reach the car George unlocking Margaret’s door in the rain

BILL (CONTD)
You need me to show you the way

George mutters angrily but doesn’t answer as he gets the door
open and Margaret into her seat Suddenly Bill is with them

BILL (CONTD)
If you left a trail of bread
crumbs the coyotes have got ‘em by
now Or they washed away

He passes the stuffed horse to Margaret who vacantly turns
the toy in her hands as though she’s never seen it before

BILL (CONTD)
She won’t say so but I can tell
Running off like this you hurt
Blanche’s feelings--

MARGARET
(instantly ignites)
Her feelings We’ve come all this
way to see Jimmy-- Our grandson
Not hers And she gives us less
than two minute’s time--

George slams the door cutting Margaret off and heads around
for the driver’s side to unlock his own door

GEORGE
Go back inside Mr Weboy

BILL
Why was your car locked

George stops Bill with a look across the car’s roof rain
splattering the metal plane between them

GEORGE
What’re you doing out here

Bill smirks seems to realize the rain now

BILL
Damned if I know

He spits as he turns and heads back to the house where a
figure in a lit upstairs window snags George’s eye Lorna
holding Jimmy watching after him and Margaret

George pauses a moment with the rain pelting down then Lorna
steps away from the window leaving the empty frame behind

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - NIGHT - (MOVING) 81

GEORGE
Goddamnit

The wipers scrub a throbbing tempo as George finds himself
lost on the trail through the dark rain

He stops reverses turns the car around and heads in another
direction checking Margaret throughout but she’s turned
away from him in her seat turned into herself

George reaches a hand to comfort Margaret but she bats it
away and the toy horse spills from her lap to the footwell

EXT BADLANDS - NIGHT 82

with the end of the unpaved track and pauses a deliberating
moment rain slashing through its headlights

INT MONTGOMERY WARD - MEN’S DEPARTMENT - DAY 85

Lorna helps a WOMAN select a neck tie to go with a shirt her
easy confident smile fading when she spots the Blackledges

Her cheeks flush red as they land at her counter and Margaret
pretends interest in the trays of handkerchiefs on display

Lorna turns to ring up the woman’s purchase at the register
and becomes flustered hits every wrong key again and again

LORNA
(to the Woman)
I’m sorry--

A rigid FLOOR MANAGER goes behind the counter to take over
and Lorna steps back from the register in embarrassed defeat

INT MONTGOMERY WARD - MEN’S DEPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 86

LORNA

Lorna comes to the opposite side of the counter from George
and Margaret who idly picks through a tray of handkerchiefs

MARGARET
I’m like a bad penny

Lorna doesn’t respond flicks her eyes to George with a small
smile of greeting as she shifts from one foot to the other

MARGARET (CONTD)
Who watches Jimmy while you’re
here

LORNA
Who do you think Donnie His
mom Or maybe you think I just tie
him to a tree until I get home

Margaret looks fully at Lorna now stung

MARGARET
Youre a good mother Lorna I
know that
LORNA
(tell me another one)
Right
MARGARET

I was merely wondering how you’re
working things out with this job

George tracks Lorna glance at the Floor Manager who watches
them all from a distance

Margaret indicates the handkerchiefs

Lorna steps away to attend to another CUSTOMER

Waitress’s face flickers at “lemon” a request with airs

collects menus from the Blackledges and leaves them to

with their former daughter-in-

law in an awkward silence

clap and ring of lunch hour dishes fills the void

Lorna peeks at them both but it’s George she finally
addresses

LORNA (CONTD)

know One four five two But
now he understands they go in
order And I’m working on his
alphabet He can spell his name

Lorna attempts a sip of scalding tea sets the burning cup

down with a clatter too hot

She stares at the cup a beat

you

Margaret looks to George at this opening

MARGARET

We miss him too Both of you
That’s what we wanted to talk to
you about Lorna And I won’t beat
around the bush

I remember when James first
introduced us This wonderful girl
he’d told us so much about So
beautiful and funny No family of
her own but--

LORNA
Thought you weren’t going to beat
around the bush I have to be back

catches him She smiles herself rolls her eyes

MARGARET
All right Here it is Let Jimmy
come back with us

Lorna’s smile goes fast

You know he’d have a good home
One he knows One he remembers--

LORNA
Stop

MARGARET
You know the school he’d go to
The teachers he’d have--

LORNA
No God Stop I can’t hear this

Her outburst hushes the nearest tables and the three sit in
silence until conversation and the scrape of cutlery resume

MARGARET
(discreetly)
I saw Donnie hit Jimmy On the
street I saw him hit you And it
didn’t look like a first time

Lorna drops her eyes again reaches for her tea but then
remembers its heat and leaves it

MARGARET (CONTD)
A little or a lot no amount’s
good That’s why we’re here

LORNA
You came to take him

GEORGE
Lorna

Lorna looks up at George’s voice its inherent authority

GEORGE (CONTD)
We came to help Whatever the
situation is
(simply)
Jimmy can’t stay there

Margaret blinks in surprise at her husband’s verdict When
did he come to this She watches Lorna’s eyes fill as George
holds her with his sure gaze

GEORGE (CONTD)
He can’t stay here

LORNA
(almost a question)
He needs his mother

MARGARET
You come with us then You and
Jimmy Live with us Like before
Well take care of you too

Now George looks to Margaret in surprise he hadn’t
anticipated this invitation Lorna checks George and he nods
his ascent just as their meals arrive None of them eat

LORNA
We were supposed to have a place in
town That’s what Donnie said Or
what they told him What they
promised Now we’re stuck out
there

She fidgets the frilled toothpick holding the sandwich
together on her plate with zero appetite

LORNA (CONTD)

He’d kill me Him and his mother
She couldn’t care less if I fell
off the face of the earth really
but She’d never let me go Or
Jimmy Donnie got away from her
once She’s not gonna let that
happen again

Tears stand in her eyes when she looks up miserable

LORNA (CONTD)
I don’t want him to grow up like
them To be like them

Margaret gets up to slide into the other side of the booth
beside Lorna the young woman swiping her eyes dry

MARGARET
Then you know what’s right

George sees Lorna’s almost imperceptible nod

MARGARET (CONTD)
You want us to drive you out there
We can do that Right now Right

insistence her look specifically to him

GEORGE
Something I’ve always wondered
about When we had to put her
down You whispered to her Do
you remember Like you were
telling secrets

Margaret nods softly

GEORGE (CONTD)
What was it you told her

MARGARET
I reminded her of things How she
liked to gallop through the first
snow every year About the time we
raced Ernie Dahlberg and his big
chocolate mare and left them
choking in our dust I reminded
her of this one time I was in high
school some October we were
heading home and the full moon was
just coming up over Dollar Butte
and she stopped Stopped and
stared Like she cared about the
moonrise as much as me And when
we put James on her back the first
time and she stood so still like
she knew she had to take care of
him

She trails off falls silent lost in her own thoughts
Then she comes back with a teary smile

MARGARET (CONTD)
I wanted to send her on her way
with happy memories

GEORGE
I’m sorry

Margaret dabs at her eyes with her napkin laughs at herself

MARGARET
Sorry Why

GEORGE
I made you sad I didn’t want
that

You didn’t make me sad George

What I wanted is to tell you what
sticks with me Strawberry and
you This woman I married but
can’t figure who doesn’t believe
there’s any world but this one but
still believes a horse has got a
soul somehow

to her across the table in the crowded dining room

bullets in and spins the cylinder back into the gun’s frame
He turns with the gun to the rust-colored mare standing in
the shaft of sunlight flooding through the tall open doors
gray hairs edging all her features like a lacy frost
Margaret (30s) whispers closely in the horse’s ear words
only she and the animal can hear as she strokes its head and

George comes to stand five feet in front of the old horse

George takes a mental bead gun still at his side as
Margaret raises the animal’s head to face him He nods

Margaret drapes sheeting across the horse’s cataract-clouded
eyes wraps its head She kisses the fabric and steps away

She goes to James in the open doorway and folds him in
turning him with her to face out to face the open land Her
eyes swim as she waits tensed for the gun’s report

George lifts the revolver and aims it at the shrouded head of
the animal standing still and tall as a mountain before him

His finger tightens on the trigger

Margaret covers her son’s ears

INT MOON WINK MOTOR COURT - CABIN - NIGHT 102
BANG
George’s eyes open in the dark Margaret stirring beside him
BANG Another knock sounds at the door a voice outside
MAN (0C)
Mr Blackledge Mrs We have an

emergency here

George gets himself up and to the door while Margaret fumbles
for the light switch

MARGARET
Is it Lorna

George opens the door and then struggles to shut it again
just as fast fighting against a force from the other side

MARGARET (CONTD)
George--

The door flies open and George staggers back as Marvin and
Elton shoulder their way in followed by Bill Weboy

GEORGE
What the hell Get out

Margaret pulls herself up as the men step aside to make room
for Donnie to enter Blanche Weboy bringing up the rear

MARGARET
You can’t come in here
BLANCHE
Too late for that Grandma We’re

in
She closes the door and slips its locking chain in place

BLANCHE (CONTD)
He let us in

GEORGE
No You get the hell out now

He moves for the door but Marvin cuts him off and Elton
barricades the door with his body his back against it

George looks to Donnie but Donnie won’t meet his eye

Bill circles the bed stopping near Margaret while Blanche
drops a canvas satchel heavy with shifting tools on the
mattress with a clank and takes a seat on the other side

BLANCHE
See you think you can gang up on
Lorna But then when it’s done to
you it’s a different story

MARGARET
What are you talking about

BLANCHE
Is that what you’re going to do
Pretend like you don’t know what
I’m talking about Pretend like
you two didn’t jump Lorna at work
Shame on you

ELTON
Two against one

George abruptly stops taking measure of each Weboy and their
position in the room when Blanche turns her attention on him

BLANCHE
Shame on both of you Badgering and
bullying her To give up her boy

She turns back to Margaret and George resumes casing the
room estimating his distance to the open suitcase laying on
the dresser behind Bill He begins inching his way there

BLANCHE (CONTD)
You’re lucky Lorna doesn’t have a
little mama grizzly in her Come
between that kind of mama and her
baby You’re fixing to get your
hand bit Or worse than

MARGARET
That’s not exactly what happened

BLANCHE
Somebody would have tried to come
between me and one of my boys
Tried to talk me out of my child--

MARGARET
That’s not what--

BLANCHE
It’s no wonder Lorna don’t want to
go with you It’s a wonder she
lasted long as she did in your
house Big bull-hen always sure
you know what’s best for everybody

She lifts an eyebrow to George half his way to the suitcase

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Pecking you to death no doubt

MARGARET
I never said she shouldn’t marry
Donnie

Blanche reels back pointing a finger at Margaret laughs

BLANCHE
Oh-ho I never said you had

MARGARET
He hit the boy

Blanche cocks her head at Margaret who turns to Donnie

MARGARET (CONTD)
I saw you Across the street from
the IGA Jimmy dropped his ice
cream And you hit him

BLANCHE
Is that what all this fuss is
about He hit-- Grandma you
gonna tell me you didn’t paddle
your own Not ever

MARGARET
He knocked him to the ground He
hit Lorna too

Blanche turns focuses on Donnie now as well

BLANCHE
Come here

George takes a step towards the suitcase when Donnie goes to
Blanche but gets blocked by Elton as bodies shuffle in the
too-tight room Blanche waves Donnie down to her level

BLANCHE (CONTD)
You hit your wife

MARGARET
I saw him

BLANCHE
Howd he do it

MARGARET
With his hand

Blanche rolls her eyes and hooks a thumb at Margaret
BLANCHE
Alberta Einstein I know his hand
I’m asking how Like--

She lashes out whip-quick slaps Donnie in the face

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Was it like that

Margaret blinks too shocked to respond

George watches Blanche’s other sons as she slaps Donnie
again dull-eyed at the sharp crack of flesh on flesh

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Donnie how’d you do it
(turns to Margaret)
How was it

MARGARET
It was harder

BLANCHE
Harder Like this

Blanche slaps Margaret A lightning strike fleet stinging

The room goes still and George sees Blanche’s handprint rise
red on his wife’s cheek but Margaret never flinches

MARGARET
Like that But harder

Blanche smiles

BLANCHE
Donnie I think you’re going to
have to show us how you done it--

George lunges for Donnie but Marvin knocks him sideways and
George falls striking his head on the bed’s iron frame

MARGARET
George

Margaret scrambles the length of the bed as a gash opens
above George’s left eye He blinks dazed wipes blood from
his brow as he hauls himself up unsteadily by the suitcase

GEORGE
(reassuring Margaret)
I’m okay

BLANCHE
Yeah Maybe you want to try
talking this over again now like
reasonable folks Or maybe youd
prefer gettin’ some sleep so you
can get an early start back home
tomorrow

Bill drifts closer to Margaret now at this end of the bed
glancing briefly at George who appears woozy unfocused

BILL
Or maybe you’d like to send him
home while you stay on for a spell
(MORE )

BILL (CONTD)
I could take you back when you’re
ready Of course by then you
might decide you’d rather stay

He snakes a finger inside the neck of Margaret’s shirt as
George reaches his hand behind his back to the open suitcase

BILL (CONTD)
We could go for another ride

Margaret slaps his hand away

MARGARET
I want to take Jimmy back with me

BLANCHE
I know what you want woman

Margaret doesn’t back down meets Blanche glaring fiercely

MARGARET
I will not let you ruin him

Blanche holds a beat then gets up without a word nodding to
Bill a shrugged signal of permission She’s all yours

BILL
Yeah

He winks at Margaret as he starts towards her on the bed

GEORGE
Stop Right there

Everyone spins to George holding the gun pointed directly at
Bill’s head not as dazed as he’s been pretending

GEORGE (CONTD)
You move away from her

Bill raises his hands in surrender and starts slowly easing
back from Margaret but Elton makes a run at George

Margaret screams as George turns the gun on Elton

Bill grabs the satchel of tools and swings it knocking the
gun from George’s hands at the same time Elton hits George

BANG
The gun fires hitting the floor at the same time as George a

stunningly loud concussion in the small space George crawls
for the gun

BLANCHE
Get it Get the gun

Marvin Bill and Elton scramble to get the revolver before
George sending it skittering across the scuffed linoleum
where it stops at the toe of Donnie’s boot He picks it up

BLANCHE (CONTD)
Get him up

The brothers haul George to his feet and pin him against the
wall bleeding again from the cut above his eye

Blanche takes the gun from Donnie to examine shaking her
head in a show of regret looks between George and Margaret

MARGARET
Please

Blanche retrieves the canvas satchel from the floor and opens
it on the dresser She reaches in among the clanking items

She locates what she wants and slowly draws it out a long-
handled iron combination tool with a double-sided head
Hammer and hatchet both A Farmer’s Ever-Ready Toolkit

George surges against Marvin and Elton already knowing
what’s coming as Blanche holds the heavy tool out to Donnie

DONNIE
What-- What do you want me to do

Blanche impatiently forces the tool on him repositioning it
in his reluctant hand hatchet blade leading

BLANCHE
Make sure he can’t pull a gun on us
again

MARGARET
No

George bucks and fights breaks one arm free to punch Marvin

Elton hangs on grinding an elbow into George’s throat as
Margaret screams The men wrestle George pin his right hand
down on the dresser top Bill forces George’s fingers apart
splays them over the lip of the dresser as George kicks

Donnie looks miserably between George’s hand and the tool
BLANCHE

I’m teaching you to teach him
See

George storms against the brothers holding him down and Bill
cracks him on the back of the head

MARGARET
Stop Please Stop Please

Donnie glances around the room as if for an exit an escape

BLANCHE
Quicker’s better

Donnie swallows and hefts the Ever-Ready

MARGARET
Donnie Don’t

George locks his eyes on Donnie’s the fierce sternly
challenging glare of a steady parent Don’t Don’t Don’t

GEORGE
Donnie You don’t have to

Donnie wields the tool up over his head

MARGARET
Donnie please

Donnie looks at George as he steels himself George shakes
his head a single tight shake No

BILL
Do it boy

GEORGE
Donnie--

Donnie swings his arm down and the hatchet’s blade plants
itself in the dresser’s wooden top separating George’s
index middle and ring fingers from the rest of his hand

His pinky hangs by a horrible mangled thread of skin

Margaret screams yet George barely grunts at the blow His
knees fold beneath him and he slides silently to the floor

Margaret scrambles down to throw herself over George as Bill
pries the Farmer’s Every-Ready blade out of the dresser

MARGARET
George My God George

Blanche watches Donnie turn away from what he’s done as she
opens the satchel for Bill to drop the tool inside

BILL
Won’t be doing much shooting now

Marvin picks up one of George’s fingers goofing

MARVIN
Trigger finger

He drops it as Donnie unchains the door to bang out of the
cabin leaving the door open behind him

Marvin and Elton follow him out as Blanche strips a pillow of
its case and slips the gun inside

BLANCHE
I’1ll hang on to the evidence if you
dont mind

She takes a last look around the cabin at Margaret crying on
the floor with George shakes her head

BLANCHE (CONTD)

Lorna told me you don’t even go to
church Yet you think you’re the

ones ought to be raising that boy

She sniffs as if disappointed in the room itself and leaves

BILL
Safe drive you two

He closes the door behind himself leaving them alone

MARGARET
George What have I done to you

GEORGE
You haven’t done a goddamn thing to
me Not yet anyway But you’re
going to have to drive me to the
hospital

EXT MOON WINK MOTOR COURT - NIGHT 103

MARGARET
We should call the police

George spies someone watching them from the motel office
window as he gets in the car with Margaret twisting a towel
tightly around his hand

The office light snaps off

GEORGE
We’re on our own Margaret

She urgently glances about sees a GUEST lower the paper
blind in the window of another cabin No one wants trouble
INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - NIGHT - (MOVING) 104
Margaret drives the night streets of Gladstone turning down
one street and then another navigating by instinct and
hunch on the lookout all the while keeping one hand
tethered to George slumped against the passenger door

She looks over at his gray pallor inert form

MARGARET
George

GEORGE
You haven’t lost me yet

EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT 105
The Blackledge’s car pulls up to the entrance and Margaret
jumps out runs around to the other side

INT HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT 106

The blood-soaked towel is unwrapped revealing Georges
mutilated hand crimson gristle bone the dangling pinky

A DOCTOR (30s) looks up in shock from the hand to George
Margaret beside him and an attending NURSE (40s)

DOCTOR
This was an axe you said

George’s thin lips barely move white in this light

GEORGE
I didn’t A hatchet

NURSE
Police are on the way

The Doctor examines the hand more closely under a lamp
DOCTOR

Look I can put you under or I
can numb it up and you stay--

GEORGE
Awake I’11 stay awake

DOCTOR
Ma’am you’re welcome to wait out--

MARGARET
Youd have to carry me out I’m
not leaving him

George smiles faintly at Margaret’s fire

GEORGE
She’s a little excited
(a joke)
Mittens are easier to knit than
gloves

INT HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM - LATER 107

The doctor cleans George’s wounds the stumps of his fingers
trimming back the ragged skin to stitch with black thread

Margaret grips her husband’s good hand leaning her head on
his broad back facing away from the Doctor and Nurse’s work

George sits upright rigid and pale as dawn as he’s sewn
together eyes fixed unwavering on a far distant point

EXT VALLEY - DAY 108
VIEW From a horizon line across a great amber valley a

range of mountains soar skyward mantels of violet snow
draping their shoulders crowning their craggy peaks

INT HOSPITAL - GUEST ROOM - DAY 109

A panoramic photograph of mountains hangs above the bed in
which George recovers hand bandaged Margaret sitting vigil
in a chair beside him lost in fretful contemplation

A window on the opposite wall offers counterpoint
Gladstone’s grim downtown and its omnipresent water tower

A knock at the open door draws Margaret’s attention to the
MAN (40s potbellied) standing there in sheriffs uniform

110 INT HOSPITAL - GUEST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 110

SHERRIF
Well now I’ve already been out to
the Weboys’s and had a chance to
hear their side of--

MARGARET
Their side-- Side of what

George restrains Margaret at her perch on the edge of his bed
while the Sheriff prowls the room a bad actor on stage

SHERRIF
The way they tell it it’s Mr
Blackledge who pulled a gun--

MARGARET
In self-defense

SHERRIF
(to George)
That your service revolver Blanche
showed me

George eyes this Sherrif striking a pose at the window and
finds not one thing he likes

GEORGE
I’m sure it is

SHERRIF
You wore the badge once

MARGARET
He wore it over thirty years

SHERRIF
Then you know how the law works

GEORGE
I’ve got a fair idea I know how it
works around here

The Sherrif shows his teeth but he’s not smiling

SHERRIF
Blanche explained things got a tad
rough persuading you to set your
weapon down

MARGARET
They chopped off his hand--

George gives Margaret a squeeze with his good hand cool it

SHERRIF
Their account is that the two of
you came here looking to take a
child away from his mother First
with talk Threats Then a gun

MARGARET
Lorna The boy’s mother Did you
see her--

SHERRIF
Oh sure She was there--

MARGARET
And you spoke with her She’s
terrified of them you know She’s-

SHERRIF
She was married to your son

GEORGE
She was

SHERRIF
He died Right He’s dead

George regards the oily man doesn’t bother answering

SHERRIF (CONTD)
How exactly did that happen

GEORGE
Why don’t you tell us

SHERRIF
An accident she said Thrown from
his horse Broke his neck
Snapped in two An accident

He sighs sadly points to George’s hand

SHERRIF (CONTD)
An accident

Margaret opens her mouth to object but then closes it

SHERRIF (CONTD)
Blanche Weboy expressed real
concern How accidents follow your
family She fears for that little
one she’s looking after now

(MORE )

SHERRIF (CONTD)
And how the longer you two stick
around the chances of something
happening to him Well those
chances keep creeping up I don’t
even want to contemplate what a
tragedy that would be

He gazes out to the water tower wags his head with a sigh

SHERRIF (CONTD)
Nothing smaller in this world than
a kid’s casket

He gives this all the air it wants then turns back to the
Blackledges Margaret now faded as gray as George

SHERRIF (CONTD)
Consensus over there is you won’t
be making any more trouble here
And because you are family by a
way the Weboys aren’t going to
press charges You are free to go

George glares at the Sherrif who pushes away from the window
begins a slow showy amble towards the door

SHERRIF (CONTD)
If I were giving out advice--

GEORGE
You can save that

SHERRIF
Well See I’m thinking on your
grandson here He’s a Weboy now
Margaret turns her anguished face to George
SHERRIF (CONTD)
Best you put Gladstone behind you
EXT MOON WINK MOTOR COURT - DAY 111

She climbs behind the wheel beside George his arm in a
sling and pulls the car out of the lot and onto the road

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY - (MOVING) 112

Margaret drives her face a map of worry passing a sign by
the side of the highway GOODBYE GLADSTONE - COME BACK SOON

Margaret glances at George his eyes closed head lolling

MARGARET
What’s wrong

GEORGE
Just pull over

MARGARET
Are you going to be sick

GEORGE
Pull over goddamnit
EXT HIGHWAY - GLADSTONE - DAY 113

Margaret wrests the car to the shoulder of the highway and
George clumsily shoves his door open nearly tumbles out

He catches himself and sits bent over breathing hard while
Margaret scrambles out of the car and around to his side

MARGARET
George Are you all right Talk
to me
GEORGE
(covering)

I’m fine
She lowers herself to his level touches him
GEORGE (CONTD)
I needed to stop s’all Give me a

second

He leans back on the seat sweat beading his pallid brow and
Margaret stands to scan the empty landscape helplessly

A wind catches her hair whipping it around and she turns in
that direction to pull it from her face

She surveys the scrubby horizon thoughtfully focusing turns
again and scrutinizes the ragged foothills and bluffs

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - DAY - (MOVING) 114
The toy horse tumbles from the seat and George lurches like a
rag doll with every rut and divot in the dirt track as
Margaret drives the distant town of Gladstone below them

INT BLACKLEDGES CAREXT PETER’S SHACK - DAY 117

A small shack crouches on a bare patch of land at the base of
a bluff gray asphalt roof shingles tacked to a patchwork of
found lumber red paint clinging to its sides and a shed

GEORGE
Where in hell are we

Margaret sounds the car’s horn She waits sounds it again--

The shack’s door cracks open and Peter Dragswolf peers out
Margaret waves as the smiling young man steps from his home

MARGARET
We’re here

INT PETER’S SHACK - DAY 118
Late sunlight cuts hard across the floor climbs the bed

Margaret gets up from her seat beside the bed to adjust the
bit of faded fabric tacked above the window shielding
George’s face slack in slumber from the spill of light

She glances around taking in the details of the shack’s one
large partitioned room Plank floor Low ceiling Frayed
magazines Dirty dishes piled in a salvaged sink beside a
small stove A beaded buckskin displayed on the wall

The bright chirp of a bridle’s bit and the thump of a hoof
draw Margaret’s attention to the shack’s open back door and
Peter removing the horse’s tack just outside

She observes the young man tending to the animal that rubs
his shoulder with its chin one creature caring for another
the other wordlessly expressing its gratitude

EXT PETER’S SHACK - SUNSET 119

PETER
What will you do

MARGARET
I don’t know

Peter feeds the horse oats from a dented pan while Margaret
replenishes the water in its trough with fresh

PETER
I heard what the Weboys done to
you Except I didn’t know it was
you

MARGARET
What’d you hear

PETER
They chopped off someone’s arm

MARGARET
Who told you that

PETER
My uncle in Gladstone

MARGARET
You have family in town then

PETER
An uncle and aunt They sell skins
for me Other stuff

Margaret studies the young man as he works
MARGARET
Why do you live out here then All

alone It’s not where you’re from

Peter continues in his chores long enough that Margaret stops
waiting for an answer turns her attention back to the horse

PETER
I ran away From the school in
Bismarck

Margaret sneaks a glance at Peter

PETER (CONTD)

The government agents came into the
house when I was eight Took me
Put me in their truck I thought
Id done something wrong that my
mother didn’t want me anymore

But then I could see she was
crying All the mothers were

MARGARET
You were eight

PETER
They cut my hair off Washed me in
kerosene Beat me To kill the
Indian inside I guess they did
When I came home I couldn’t
understand my grandmother’s words
anymore “My name is Peter now” I
tried to tell her But she
couldn’t understand me either

He surveys the landscape as the sun drops from sight shrugs
PETER (CONTD)
If I don’t belong any place here

is fine

Margaret takes in the view beside him sees the wide flat
disc of a nearly full moon on the rise opalescent at dusk

MARGARET
You picked a good spot

She lays a maternal hand gently on his arm

MARGARET (CONTD)
But it’s not good to be alone

I’m not alone

He smiles and strokes the horse Margaret nods conceding

INT PETER’S SHACK - EVENING 120
Margaret pulls the iron skillet from the box she’d packed at
home and sets it to heat on the stove scraping in potatoes

to brown She tastes soup she’s making in a big enamel pot

She takes a can of beans from the box of groceries when
her attention snags on a man’s humming just shy of a tune

She listens then goes to the room’s makeshift partition and
peers around to discover Peter humming as he rebinds George’s
hand weaving a meticulous web with a ribbon of white gauze

She holds watching Peter as he works singing his hushed
song in an ancestor’s tongue to her husband as he sleeps

Peter glances up at Margaret
PETER
Can you die from getting your
fingers cut off
GEORGE

(not asleep after all)
Jesus Christ I’m not deaf

INT PETER’S SHACK - NIGHT 121

Margaret ladles soup into a bowl at the stove

INT PETER’S SHACK - NIGHT 122
George sits himself up in bed to receive a bowl of soup from
Margaret and they both realize at the same moment that he
wont be able to hold it himself with his damaged hand

George takes a spoon from Margaret and she sits facing him
cradling the bowl near enough so he can feed himself

George exhales a mirthless laugh at their pitiful setup

Margaret leans close lowers her voice so Peter won’t be able
to hear on the other side of partition

MARGARET
I have an idea

GEORGE
That’s not a first

He scoops a spoonful of the soup eats

MARGARET
Now let me finish before you make
fun of me And if you don’t know
what to say don’t say anything

GEORGE
Let’s hear it

MARGARET
What if we stayed Here

George pauses the spoon and Margaret rushes ahead

MARGARET (CONTD)
I’m sure Peter’d be glad of the
company We could build on to this
place put another room on the
backside of the kitchen--

GEORGE
You hold the boards while I hammer
in the nails s’that it

MARGARET
You said youd let me finish

GEORGE
Youre finished now you just don’t
know it

He drops the spoon in the bowl Done

GEORGE (CONTD)

You want us to live in the shadow
of a rock with an Indian boy and a
lost horse Just so you can drive
into town every now and again to
try and catch a peek at Jimmy

(shakes his head)
You gonna follow him to school
Hope time untwists a sour mind and
Blanche Weboy lets you hold him
again Someday For more than
thirty seconds’s time

GEORGE
And when they hack off another
couple pieces of me Or when they
start taking pieces of you if
there’s anything left once you’re
done tearing yourself apart

GEORGE (CONTD)
What then And when they hurt
Jimmy And they will Just for
spite How’re you gonna feel then

Margaret stirs the cold soup unable to meet George’s eye

MARGARET
First time I held him He
arranged himself easy Just right
in my arms Snug to me And light
as can be Like feathers--

GEORGE
Jesus Christ Margaret When will
you stop torturing yourself

She stops stung but still can’t bring herself to look at
her husband as she struggles to keep her tears at bay

MARGARET
I’m sorry I know I’ve tortured
you too

GEORGE
No

MARGARET

I know I have
She sets the bowl down to take his good hand in hers

MARGARET (CONTD)

We’ll go But not home There’s
nothing for us there now We’ll
keep driving Car’s packed We
can go to California Maybe see an
ocean Or north But I can’t
go back

Her voice breaks apart as she looks at George now

MARGARET (CONTD)
I tried I tried George

George slips his hand from Margaret’s to wipe away her tears

GEORGE
I know Shhh I know

MARGARET
I couldn’t save him God help me

George pulls his wife to him and holds her tight rocking her
like a child as she finally surrenders to all her
overwhelming grief Margaret weeps in George’s embrace

pile of blankets on the floor at the foot of the bed

Margaret’s eyes open in the semi-dark She listens in bed
suddenly alert unsure what’s woken her

Then the churn of a car’s ignition cuts the night

She sits straight up as the car’s engine catches and she
turns to George beside her

She scrambles up and dashes past Peter on the floor to fling
open the door just as the car outside shifts into drive

in to fit the bit and reins working together with speed

outside the kitchen door noiselessly makes a selection

He breaks a double barrel shotgun open one-handed cradles it
in the nook of his arm to load in shells with his good hand

George scrutinizes all the closed doors surrounding the open
U-shaped railing at the top of the staircase orienting

himself to the layout of rooms in near-pitch blackness

A muted cough and the faint twang of a bedspring stop him in
place as someone rolls over in sleep behind one of the doors

George waits

Jimmy sleeps on a folding army cot by the window his mother
in the room’s big bed her back turned to Donnie

Donnie sleeps on his back but his eyes spring open when
George covers his mouth and nose with his bandaged hand

Donnie starts to struggle for air reaching for George
standing over him but George presses the open barrels of the
shotgun he holds in his good hand to Donnie’s temple

GEORGE
Settle Be still

Donnie stops staring up wide-eyed and George jerks his
chin at Lorna whispers low

GEORGE (CONTD)
Wake her

Lorna’s already stirring when Donnie shakes her hip

LORNA
Wha--

She barely keeps herself from screaming when she rolls over
to find George holding the shotgun on Donnie in the dark
Her eyes dart to Jimmy still asleep on the cot and back

GEORGE
Do you want to go back to Dalton
You and Jimmy You have to decide
Go or stay

DONNIE

George presses the gun’s barrels cutting Donnie’s temple

GEORGE
Not you You don’t get to say a
goddamn word This is up to her

Lorna stares at George paralyzed He keeps his voice low

GEORGE (CONTD)

You know what life will be Here
or there you know This isn’t
something you need to think on

Go I’11 go

She turns on the bedside lamp revealing a ripe black eye to
the light She throws off the covers and goes to lift Jimmy
carries the child as he stirs in sleep back to George

feet plucks at his pajamas

Jimmy’s things I have to--

GEORGE
No Out now Quiet as you can
Take the front door Then run like
hell

Lorna steps into her shoes and puts her hand on the door
knob She takes a last look at Donnie glaring from the bed

GEORGE (CONTD)
Lorna

She looks to George Jimmy’s head on her shoulder

GEORGE (CONTD)
The front door

Lorna nods slowly eases the bedroom door open its hinge
chirps She stops holds then dares to inch it wider

Her nostrils flare when she detects the thin layer of smoke
accumulating in the dark hallway and turns back to George in
alarm He prods her forward with a look mouths the words

GEORGE (CONTD)
Front door

Lorna steps shaking into the hall and Jimmy lifts his head
squinting sleepily at George in the room behind them smiles

JIMMY
Grandpa

The child’s clear voice carries bell-like on the night

Lorna freezes mid-stride Donnie’s eyes dart to George who
makes a shushing shape with his mouth for Jimmy

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 134

Lorna listens to the still house a breathless beat eyes
squeezed shut then she exhales and dashes forward

Lumbering movement erupts in one of the rooms and Lorna skids
to a stop when a door bangs open and Elton steps out directly
in front of her He puts his nose to the air

ELTON
Something’s burning

He doesn’t give her a second look but dashes for the rear of
the house and the back stairs pounding down to the kitchen

MARVIN
Did you leave the stove on

Marvin passes Lorna and Jimmy still frozen on the landing as
he pulls on his coveralls following right behind Elton

DONNIE (0S)
Help

Lorna’s head swivels towards the bedroom at Donnie’s shout

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - BEDROOM - NIGHT 135
Donnie grabs for the shotgun but George fights it free spins

it to bring its butt cracking down knocking Donnie out The
force of the blow shears the skin back on Donnie’s forehead

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - UPSTAIRS HALLSTAIRS - NIGHT 136

Jimmy screams when the door right beside Lorna crashes open
and Bill Weboy steps bleary-eyed into the hall

BILL
The fuck is going on

Lorna breaks for the stairs but Bill snags Jimmy by the
sleeve of his pajamas yanks the child from Lorna’s arms

BILL (CONTD)
Where ya think you two are going

LORNA
No

She springs at Bill snatching for Jimmy who falls to the
floor just as Blanche appears in the open door behind Bill

BLANCHE
What’s--

BLAM

The hall flashes blinding bright when George fires the
shotgun narrowly missing Bill who pivots in his direction

Blanche slams her bedroom door and Lorna scoops Jimmy up but
Bill grabs him back clasps the boy to his chest as a shield
as George advances Lorna claws at Bill for her crying son

LORNA
Stop Stop it Let him go

Bill shoves Lorna away and she staggers backwards blindly
stepping right off the landing She cries out as she falls
banging banging banging down the stairs to a stop midway

George lunges and seizes Jimmy from Bill hooking the arm of
his damaged hand around the boy’s torso shotgun in his one
good hand but Bill keeps a grip on the boy’s leg and pulls

The bedroom door springs open again and Blanche reappears
aiming George’s service revolver at the men and the boy

George raises the shotgun but Bill bats it from his grip
It clatters over the railing lands in the hall far below

BLANCHE
Bill Outta the way I got him

BILL
Christ Blanche Don’t shoot

She squints an eye closed finger tightening on the trigger
and Bill tries to dodge clear but George seizes him back

BANG

The gun fires cracking lightning-bright in the dark hall
the gathering smoke holding its flare like storm clouds

LORNA
No

Bill looks at George with bemused surprise a small hole in
his cheek He opens his mouth as though to ask a question
and falls dead Blanche gapes blinking at George

GEORGE
(calling down)
Lorna

Blanche points the gun again at George holding Jimmy and
George swings the clinging child out over the railing
dangling him high above the steep stairs Lorna craning up

LORNA
Jimmy

BLANCHE
Give the boy to me old man No
one gets hurt
George lets Jimmy go The child drops through the smoky air

Blanche shoots George

He falls carried by the bullet that strikes him high in the
chest as Lorna catches Jimmy on the stairs below

Blanche cranes over the railing locks eyes with Lorna and
Lorna breaks for the front door standing open to the night
across the deep foyer at the bottom of the stairs

Blanche dashes for the top of the stairs at the same time
Marvin and Elton explode up the back stairs into the hall

ELTON MARVIN
Who’s shooting We’re on fire

Blanche comes around the end of the railing

BLANCHE
Get her

-And George’s hand suddenly closes over hers from behind
He snaps the gun up still in Blanche’s grip and fires

Marvin drops dead while running his momentum sending him
down the front stairs as Blanche screams

George pivots with Blanche taking aim at Elton as he comes

EXT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - NIGHT 137
BANG

The horse shies and rears up as the echoing gunshot reaches
Margaret and Peter riding into view of the distant house

front door yawning open a spiral of smoke threading skyward

MARGARET
Oh my God

And then she spots Lorna a lone figure stumbling at a run
away from the house pitched forward with her son’s weight
EXT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - FRONT DRIVE - NIGHT 138
Lorna desperately searches the inky night ahead for the car

LORNA
It’s okay baby It’s okay

MARGARET
Lorna

Lorna ducks at the call reflexively veers away from the
galloping horse headed in her direction

MARGARET (CONTD)
Lorna Wait Stop

Lorna recognizes Margaret’s voice now and slows as Margaret
and Peter arrive She begins to cry as Margaret climbs down

Margaret embraces Jimmy and Lorna with urgent relief

MARGARET (CONTD)
Are you all right

Lorna nods rhythmically but can’t speak

MARGARET (CONTD)
Where’s George

Lorna shakes her head pitifully her breath ragged and wet

LORNA
He said to run To take the car

Margaret turns to Peter

MARGARET
Stay with them

He nods and Margaret takes off on foot

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - FRONT HALLSTAIRS - NIGHT 139

The shotgun lays on the floor where it fell from upstairs
deep in the foyer far from the front door framing the moon

Beyond the door Margaret steps from the pitch night into a
spill of light She cautiously approaches mounts the porch

She peers from the threshold taking measure of what she can
shotgun smoke the fire snarling behind the kitchen door

She sees Marvin’s prone body facedown on the staircase

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - FRONT HALLSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER 140
Margaret breaches the double shotgun to check its load
plucks the spent cartridge from one barrel closes the gun
the crack and click of metal ring loud in the stillness
despite the fire’s growing voice at the rear of the house

She scans the ground floor rooms for any sign of George
backing away from the snapping heat of the kitchen aflame

She carries the shotgun to the stairs inches her way up
straining for a view of the upper hall one eye on Marvin

She stops at his body nudges him with her toe Dead
She stretches her neck to bring the upstairs floor into view

A spray of blood clouds the far wall Elton sitting blank-
faced under its spatter staring dumbly at Margaret in death

She sees Bill lying dead in the murky hall and George
sprawled on his back on the floor

MARGARET
George

She clambers over Marvins body scrambles up the stairs

INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 141

Margaret drops to her knees beside George his chest rapidly
rising and falling beneath his bloodstained shirt

MARGARET
George George

His eyes swim and search for Margaret in the smoky dim

GEORGE
Jimmy Where’s Jimmy

MARGARET
He’s safe George With Lorna
And Peter They’re waiting for us

She helps him sit up and he takes count of Elton and Bill

GEORGE

Where’s Blanche
MARGARET

I don’t-- I don’t know
GEORGE

Go Get out of here

MARGARET
Not without you

She loops George’s arm around her neck and he leverages
himself up with the railing He takes the shotgun to use for
support shuffling with Margaret through the gathering smoke
as the back stairwell glows bright with licking flames

DONNIE (0S)
Momma

George looks behind them as Donnie pulls himself from the
bedroom crawling blind blood running down his face
INT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - FRONT HALLSTAIRS - NIGHT 142

George grits his teeth navigating his way down with Margaret
Donnie calling above them as the fire enters the upstairs

DONNIE (0S)
Help

PETER (0S)
Margaret George

They both look to where Peter arrives on the porch outside

GEORGE
Stay there Where you are

But Peter dodges inside despite the fire He crosses the
foyer climbs the stairs to help takes George’s other arm

A crash sounds at the back of the house as the fire runs
riot roaring up the back stairs from the kitchen

George Margaret and Peter reach the ground floor together
but only George senses Blanche as she enters the hall behind
them George’s revolver raised and pointed in her hand

George pushes Margaret from as him as he turns

BANG

The banister’s newel post splinters beside George
BANG

George lurches backwards stumbling out of Peter’s grip and
falls to the ground

MARGARET
George

She drops to the floor beside him as Peter spins around to
see Blanche framed by the kitchen in flames behind her

MARGARET (CONTD)
George George

His eyes won’t focus as fresh blood soaks his shirt

MARGARET (CONTD)
George Look at me Please

He gropes for his wife’s hand as a widening pool of blood
spreads from beneath him She grasps his hand in hers

MARGARET (CONTD)
I’m here I’m right here

George places Margaret’s hand on the shotgun on the floor
beside them

BANG

Peter ducks when Blanche fires again advancing on them
through the smoke eyes dancing furious and bright

BLANCHE
Why WHYYYYYYYYY

Margaret lets go of George’s hand to take up the shotgun
She lifts it from the floor fits its stock to her shoulder

Blanche stops in place when she sees Margaret turn sighting
down the long length of the shotgun’s double barrels at her

Blanche laughs aims George’s revolver squarely at Margaret

BLANCHE (CONTD)
You You go to hell

BOOM

Margaret fires The shotgun flashes And Blanche falls
backwards into a wall of flame Dead

Margaret drops the shotgun and comes back to George his face
smooth now in complete stillness eyes closed

MARGARET
George George

Peter tugs at Margaret’s arm and she looks up at him
Peter shakes his head softly grimly
Margaret looks back to George Her husband No longer

DONNIE (0S)
Help me

Peter glances to the top of the burning stairs where Donnie’s
managed to drag himself among the flames

Margaret traces George’s features with shaking fingers

Peter pulls urgently at Margaret again She tries to shake
him off jerk her arm free But he keeps his grip

Margaret blinks at Peter in torn anguish
She turns to George searches his familiar face now empty

She lowers her lips to his and kisses him a last time Then
Margaret puts her mouth to George’s ear

She whispers words meant only for him

Peter seizes Margaret forcefully and hauls her to her feet
and leads her away through the smoke and blistering heat

DONNIE (0S) (CONTD)

EXT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - NIGHT 143

The blazing structure reflects in the dark gleaming eyes of
the horse standing with Margaret Lorna Jimmy and Peter

Margaret stares into the pyre shattered confounded by shock
and fathomless loss Lorna rocks Jimmy shielding his view

The house collapses into itself the second floor caving
under the burning roof Swirling sparks and embers swarm the
sky as the flames climb high to light the night

PETER
People will come We can’t be
here

EXT WEBOY HOMESTEAD - FRONT DRIVE - NIGHT 144

The group hikes from the burning house towards George and
Margaret’s parked car highlighted by the setting moon

EXT BADLANDS - NIGHT 145

Peter settles Jimmy on Lorna’s lap in the car’s passenger
seat and turns to Margaret who holds the horse’s reins

Margaret regards Peter in the near dark then steps forward
and embraces the young man her voice faint and choked

MARGARET
Thank you

She hands him the reins then goes around the car climbs into
the driver’s seat and reaches for the keys in the ignition

She falters a moment when she takes the keys in her hand but
she sets her mouth decisively starts the engine

INT BLACKLEDGES CAR - PRE-DAWN - (MOVING) 146

Margaret tracks Peter waving them goodbye from his mount man
and horse silhouetted against the night’s lightening sky
receding in her side view mirror then swallowed by distance

Margaret turns her eyes forward navigating the way along the
dirt road through the semi-dark keeping her headlights off

Jimmy sits beside Margaret wide-eyed encircled by his
mother’s arms Lorna scanning the gloom as tense as a doe

The pop and crunch of rocks hitting the car’s underside and
the running engine are the only sounds as they drive

Jimmy spies the old stuffed horse laying on the floor of the
car and reaches to pick it up hugs it to him

They come to the intersection of the main road with the end
of the Weboy’s track and Margaret pauses peering along the
ribbon of black leading to Gladstone No lights No sirens

LORNA
Go

Margaret glances at Lorna who indicates only forward Go
Margaret rolls them out onto the pavement and points the car

in the opposite direction of town switching on the
headlights as they steal into the still-dim landscape

The thrum of paved road beneath the tires creates a faint
rhythm a phantom heartbeat that invades the car

Margaret searches the dark road ahead her forehead knotting
over with the twist and pull of thoughts

Lorna lays a hand on Margaret’s arm and Margaret turns to
meet her eyes shining at Margaret in the gray light before
day a steady gaze of witness understanding connection

Lorna lowers her eyes to Jimmy now asleep his head in her
lap and takes her hand from Margaret’s arm to smooth the
boys hair raked by the breeze from her open window
Margaret scrolls her own window down letting fresh air in
A flare of light sparks her eye in the rearview mirror

She squints into the sheering ray of reflected light

It takes her a moment to recognize the light for what it is
the sun breaking the distant horizon behind them in the east

The strong light grows illuminating Margaret’s face by the
mirror and floods the car with its warmth as she drives
EXT ROAD - DAWN 147

The car follows the road flowing west chasing the endless
string of pavement across the valley floor and out of sight

Gone

The sun keeps coming long fingers of light scrabbling for
purchase on the land
