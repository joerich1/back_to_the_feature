with one fact is king You said there was
another thing

In the meeting with the Foreign Office
the Committee was accidentally briefly
alluded to

LINTON
(putting his hand over his
mouth so he cant be lip-
read)
Which committee

BOB ADRIANO
(doing the same)
The war committee

LINTON
Karen must not find out about that She
is an excitable yapping she-dog Okay get
the minutes of the meeting we need to
correct the record

BOB ADRIANO
We can do that

Page 33

32 CON TINUE D 32

LINTON
Yes we can Theyre an aide memoir for
us So they should not be a reductive
record of what happened to be said but a
more full record of what was intended to

be said I think thats the more accurate
version right

LATER Bob Adriano is going through the minutes with
Linton

LINTON (CONTD)
I dont like this section Cut that I
dont think this is really what France
are saying Lets change that And these
And lets reverse this

BOB ADRIANO
Thats something Karen said

LINTON
Thats way off agenda Karen Although it
would seem a general consensus may be
forming

KAREN
What makes you say that

LINTON
Well I noted with interest the recent
comments of our colleague Simon Foster in
that regard

Simon is texting under the desk and not really paying

full attention

He hears his name looks up waves to th

group He doesnt clock Karens intense look that says

“You are going

to rebut that arent you

KAREN
Perhaps Mr Foster would have something
to say about that

SIMON

(politely)
Im justwatching with interest IN
Britain we have a saying for complicated
situations such as this which is that
its

(he cant believe hes going

to say this)
“Difficult difficult lemon difficult

He goes back to his text

As I say it seems a consensus is forming
