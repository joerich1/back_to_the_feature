her child (Mary Cassatt’s painting Mother and Child) and a
painting of naked woman lying provocatively on a couch
(Goya’s The Nude Maja)

spend days looking at

AGNES
What do you mean

YOUNG MAN
They’re each a thousand pieces
They take forever

Agnes looks at them

AGNES
Ill take both

She carries her pile of puzzles to the counter The Young Man
starts RINGING her up

Agnes focuses on a handwritten sign with tiny tabs hanging
off the bottom on a bulletin board nearby “CHAMPION
DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR PUZZLE PARTNER” She gazes at the
sign for a while then looks away and finds her wallet but
then her eyes land on the sign again

AGNES (CONTD)
(pointing to sign)
What’s that about “Desperately”

The Young Man turns to look at the sign

right choices No matter how many
wrong pieces you tried to fit into
the wrong place at the very end
everything makes one perfect
picture I know it sounds
simplistic but-- Why would I ever
want to deny myself that kind of
feeling What other pursuit can
give you that kind of perfection

(reading)

I love my mother but I also feel
bad for her She’s a sheltered
person and doesnt think of
anything but serving the men in her
A child of Hungarian
immigrants she lost her mother
when she was young and grew up
doting on her dad She’s stil
living in the house he raised her
in When he died after a long
illness she fell apart She was
treated for emotional problems and
has never been the same from what I
remember I want to be different I
want to go to-- collage -- and
learn about other cultures not
just my own and other ways of
being I want to travel I want to
gain self-awareness and be sane I
want to try new religions New
foods I don’t want to just become
my father who is too scared to

ink outside the box or m
mother who just wont let herself
come alive

He puts the essay down Awkward pause

ROBERT (CONTD)
He does say he loves you
