OVER DARKNESS

we hear what we will come to know as the VOICE OF THE
GUIDE
GUIDE VOICE
It is an important and popular fact that
things are not always what they seem

A small square image appears on screen Home video The
dolphin stadium at Sea World

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
For instance on the planet Earth man had
The

always assumed that he was the most
intelligent species occupying the planet
instead of the third most intelligent
which was in fact entirely accurate

dolphins perform leaping through hoops etc

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
The second most intelligent creatures
were of course dolphins who curiously
enough had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet Earth They had
made many attempts to alert mankind to the
danger but most of their communications
were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to
punch footballs or whistle for tidbits so
they eventually decided they would leave
Earth by their own means

leap madly desperately Higher and higher

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
The last ever dolphin message was
misinterpreted as a surprisingly
sophisticated attempt to do a double-
backward somersault through a hoop while
whistling the Star-Spangled Banner but
in fact the message was this
So long and thanks for all the fish

ES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES)

hins leap over and interact with the opening titles
thtaking somersaults back flips choreographed to a
y Berkley-style song called SO LONG AND THANKS FOR
THE FISH We end with a wide shot of all the

hins jumping out of the top of frame but they never

dolphins have vanished

CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates
A hand shuts it off ARTHUR DENT is awake 30s Kind

IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror
He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER
through the window crawling toward his house A TEA
KETTLE WHISTLES OS

INT ARTHUR DENTS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline DOLPHINS
VANISH) on the table removes the kettle Doesnt notice
through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS

He pours a cup of tea sets the pot down next o his
mobile phone He picks it up stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO
ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)
at a costume party

He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold
compress Suddenly theres a LOUD RUMBLING os The
tea cup RATTLES Arthur looks out the window Now he
sees the bulldozers

The tea cup shatters on the floor
CUT TO
EXT ARTHUR DENTS HOUSE - MORNING

Arthur dressed in pajamas and robe lies in the dirt in
front of a bulldozer blocking it from destroying his
house He yells into his mobile phone

ARTHUR

(into phone)
What do you mean hes gone out to lunch
You just said he was still at breakfast

MR PROSSER a bureaucrat leans over him

PROSSER
Come off it Mr Dent You cant lie in
front of the bulldozers forever

ARTHUR
Im game Well see who rusts first
PROSSER
This bypass has got to be built and its
going to be built You should have made
your protest months ago

ARTHUR
The first I heard of it was when a workman
came yesterday I asked if hed come to
clean the windows and he said hed come
to demolish the house He didnt tell me
right away of course First he wiped a
couple of windows and charged me twenty
quid Then he told me

HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8803

The bulldozer driver looking guilty ducks behind the
steering wheel Prosser removes plans from his briefcase

PROSSER
Look These plans have been on display at
the planning office now for a year

ARTHUR
On display I had to go down to a cellar

PROSSER
Thats the display department

ARTHUR
I eventually found them in the bottom of a
locked filing cabinet in a disused
lavatory with a sign on the door saying
beware of the leopard

PROSSER
Mr Dent have you any idea how much
damage that bulldozer would suffer if I
just let it roll straight over you

ARTHUR
How much

PROSSER
None at all
FORD (0S)

Arthur

Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill
pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
bags of peanuts This is FORD PREFECT Wiry intense

As he heads downhill he leaps up and rides the cart down
towards Arthurs house -- like a kid in a supermarket

He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers

ARTHUR

Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the
bulldozer driver He pushes the cart over to him

ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves
his hand and the all the dozer engines die
The bulldozer drivers step down start drinking the beer
and eating the peanuts Ford returns to Arthur

FORD
Cmon Lets go to the pub He said they
wont destroy your house until theyve

ARTHUR
I assumed you were drunk

FORD
(shaking his head)

ARTHUR
STOP STOP YOU BASTARDS

Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we
hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY

A GIGANTIC YELLOW SPACESHIP (picture a concrete tower

block) ) sweeps overhead Ford hits the deck Arthur is
blown sideways Trees are uprooted

Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthurs

house He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes
up with -- A TOWEL He hurries to Arthurs side

development of the outlying regions of the
galaxy involve the building of a

snowy distorted image Jeltzs voice blares through the

The VOGON BRIDGE is like a waterlogged old Skoda

JELTZ (INTO THE PA)
Theres no point in acting all surprised
about it The plans and demolition orders
have been on display at your local planning
office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your
Earth years so youve had plenty of time
to lodge formal complaints

Like a giant casino going down in Vegas there are a few
small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES Just collapses
in on itself Gone

The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation leaving
nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS

Then a distant RED GLOW appears As it gets nearer we 21
see that it saysTHE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

GUIDE VOICE
The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a
wholly remarkable book

The title draws nearer We see that it sits on an
electronic book with lots of buttons

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
Perhaps the most remarkable certainly
the most successful book ever to come out
of the great publishing corporations of
Ursa Minor

The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS Images appear A
star map layers of data captions video animations

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE
OMNIBUS better selling than 53 MORE
THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY and more
controversial than Oolon Colluphids
trilogy of philosophical blockbusters
WHERE GOD WENT WRONG SOME MORE OF GODS
GREATEST MISTAKES and WHO IS THIS GOD
PERSON ANYWAY

Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as

the book presents itself like some hi-tech infomercial

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
In many of the more relaxed civilizations
on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy
the Hitchhikers Guide has already
supplanted the great Encyclopedia
Galactica as the standard repository of
all knowledge and wisdom For though it
has many omissions and contains much
which is apocryphal or at least wildly
inaccurate it scores over the older more
pedestrian work in two important respects
First it is slightly cheaper And second
it has the words DONT PANIC printed in
large friendly letters on its cover

The book closes The words DONT PANIC appear just
below the title blinking like a tacky diner marquee

PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it the
blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face

HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8803

INT HOLD OF VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP - NIGHT

Arthur in total shock holds up the guide

ARTHUR
So youre not from Guilford which would
explain the accent -- which Ive always
wondered aboutand youre not an out of
work actor -- but rather a writer for
thisthisbook thing

Ford nods Arthur rubs his weary brow

ARTHUR (CONTD)
I dont feel well I need a cup of tea

Ford hands him a fistful of peanuts
FORD
Here Eat these If youve never been

through a transmat beam before youve
probably lost some salt and protein

Arthur eats some peanuts sits up squints Ford feels
his way around the room looking for something

ARTHUR
If I asked where we were would I regret

FORD
Were safe For now

ARTHUR
Good
FORD
Were in a storage hold in one of
the
ships of the Vogon constructor fleet
ARTHUR
Obviously some strange usage of the word
safe I wasnt previously aware of
FORD
(not getting the sarcasm)
Is it
ARTHUR
Tell me youre joking
FORD
Okay Im joking
ARTHUR
And do a reassuring little laugh
Ford does a reassuring little laugh

He pulls out his cell phone Desperately punches numbers
Ford flips on a light switch revealing a messy chamber
full of alien junk and old mattresses

FORD
You dont remember do you
(taking his cell phone)
Okay Ive got something to tell you It
aint gonna be easy but youre gonna have
to just deal okay

Blown up BLOWN UP Couldnt you have
done something

FORD
I did I saved you

HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8803

ARTHUR
But theres six billion other people

FORD
And all those ants

ARTHUR
Yes but ants arent exactly people

FORD
And now youre thinking like a Vogon
(before Arthur can respond)
I saved your life okay Which makes us
even Next thing

Ford throws Arthur a towel Arthur looks confused

FORD (CONTD)
Its a tough galaxy You want to survive
out here you really gotta know where your
towel is Now gimme a hand over here

Arthur joins Ford near a rusty ventilation pipe

FORD (CONTD)
Careful its hot

He slides the towel behind the pipe holding each end of
it Arthur does the same

FORD (CONTD)
Weve got to get off this ship before the
Vogons find us Vogons hate hitchhikers
Which is why they make ships with walls
that wont allow the Sub-Etna signal to
pass through So weve got to send the
signal up and out if we wanna catch a
ride Pull

They both pull A section of pipe snaps off Steam
shoots out Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
Vogons are one of the most unpleasant
races in the Galaxy - not evil but bad-
tempered bureaucratic officious and
callous They wouldnt even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers from the
Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without
orders signed in triplicate sent in sent
back queried lost found subjected to
public inquiry lost again and finally
buried in soft peat for three months and
recycled as fire-lighters

Arthur touches HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon
is to stick your finger down his throat

Arthur touches WHAT TO AVOID

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
On no account should you allow a Vogon to

read poetry to you

FORD

They cant think they cant imagine most
of them cant even spell They just run
things

(turns dial opposite direction)
And if we dont get a ride soon you wont
b need the guide to illustrate just how
unpleasant the Vogons can be
Theyve destroyed a planet today that
always makes them a little feisty

one knew much about Earth Thats why I

was there To expand the entry I fired

off a new one to the editor before I got
stranded

What does it say now

FORD
Mostly harmless

Before Arthur can react a speaker HUMS to life with
screeching HOWLS and GARGLES Arthur cups his ears

ARTHUR
Ahhh what the hell is that

FORD
Here Put this in your ear

Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch He
moves to put it in Arthurs ear Arthur struggles

ARTHUR

The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues Ford has to wrestle to
get the fish in Arthurs ear

JELTZ (ON SPEAKER)

ARTHUR
Argh Whats happening

As he succeeds the noise mutates to the Vogon Captains
voice Arthur looks incredulous

JELTZ (ON SPEAKER)
This is your captain speaking so stop
whatever youre doing and pay attention

FORD
The fish Its translating for you

JELTZ (ON SPEAKER)
According to our instruments we have
unwittingly picked up a couple of
hitchhikers who must be apprehended and

It feeds on brainwave energy absorbing
unconscious frequencies and excreting
a matrix of conscious frequencies to the

upshot of which is that if you stick one in

said to you in any language

The second worst is that of the Azgoths of

Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found
in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning four
of his audience died of internal
hemorrhaging and the President of the Mid-

So Earthlings I present you with a
simple choice Either die in the vacuum
of space or -- tell what you thought of

Yes No wait Whats this switch

No its nothing We are going to die

Arthur sits for a moment then oddly chuckles to himself

ARTHUR
You know its at times like this when
Im trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man
from Betelgeuse and about to die of
asphyxiation in deep space that I really
wish Id listened to what my mother told
me when I was young

FORD
Why What did you she tell you

ARTHUR
I dont know I didnt listen

Ford folds his towel into a tiny square holds it up
toward Arthur He raises an eyebrow Will this help

to each other Shrug They might be okay Then --

Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship holding their

Space says the introduction to the
Hitchhikers Guide is big Really big
You just wont believe how vastly hugely
mind-bogglingly big it is I mean you
may think its a long way down the road to
the market but thats just peanuts
compared to space and so on

The weightless guide twirls away Arthur reaches for it
The words DONT PANIC alight

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
It also says that if you hold a lung full
of air you can survive in the total vacuum
of space for about thirty seconds -- but
with space being really big and all the
chances of being picked up within that
time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1

Something else falls out of his pocket -- his digital
phone with the photo of he and Tricia at the fancy dress
party

GUIDE VOICE (CONTD)
which by a staggering coincidence is
also the telephone number of the Islington
flat where Arthur once went to a fancy
dress party and met a very nice girl whom
he totally failed to connect with

He reaches for the phone its just beyond his fingertips
His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away

EXT SPACE - NIGHT

The HOG arches away The whale in mid-air stops
rising starts falling

GUIDE VOICE
It is important to note that suddenly and
against all probability a sperm whale had
been called into existence several miles
above the surface of an alien planet And
since this is not a naturally tenable
position for a whale this innocent
creature had very little time to come to
terms with its identity as a whale before
it then had to come to terms with suddenly
not being a whale any more This is what
it thought as it fell

The camera moves around the whale as it falls

what it is Calm down get a grip now
ooh This is an interesting sensation

WHALE (VO) (CONTD)
Oh This is an interesting sensation
what is it Its a sort of yawning
tingling sensation in well I suppose Id
better start finding names for things if I
want to make any headway in what for the
sake of what I shall call an argument I
shall call the world so lets call it my
stomach Good Ooooh Its getting quite
strong now And heywhats this whistling
roaring sound going past what Im suddenly
going to call my head Perhaps I can call
that wind Is that a good name Itll
do Perhaps I can give it a better name
later when Ive found out what its for
It must be very important because there
certainly seems to be an awful lot of it
Hey Whats this thing this lets call
it a tail - yeah Tail

The whale thrashes its tail Between the camera and the
whale drops the bowl of petunias It falls from sight

WHALE (VO) (CONTD)
Hey I can really thrash it about pretty
good cant I Wow Wow Doesnt seem to
achieve much but Ill probably find out
what its for later on How Have I built
up a coherent picture of things yet
No Never mind Hey this is really
exciting so much to find out about ao
much to look forward to Im quite dizzy
with anticipation Or is it the wind
There really is an awful lot of that now
isnt there

Its eye tries to look down Camera pulls back from the
whale abandoning it

And hey Whats this thing coming
suddenly coming towards me very fast so
big and flat and round it needs a big
wide-sounding name like ow oundround

itll be friends with me

We hear a sickening thud os

Curiously the only thing that went
through the mind of the bowl of petunias
as it fell was Oh no not again

We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING

the bowl of petunias had thought that we
would know a lot more about the nature of

The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the HOG parked in the

along with a few petunias They all grimace

BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks
aligned in a circle Its the only structure in sight

They walk toward it

Arthur looks up registers surprise

THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer
The rocks letters carved into them that read DESIGN

Must be portal doors

ARTHUR
You mean -- the hippies were right

In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist
desk with a sign on it that says OUT TO LUNCH

Zaphod heads for the To Design Department stone
Trillian and Ford follow

Zaphod feels around it looking for a switch a knob
anything He mustve hit something because the front of
the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING
VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE

They all start arguing over each other We focus on

Trillian -- Anger and frustration building she covers
her ears -- then screams
TRILLIAN
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH III tre

And she takes off running for the door Suicide Bravery

They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex
She YELPS as her body is bent in half twisted like a
rung mop then sucked inside

Arthur is horrified literally gasping for air Ford is
semi-impressed Zaphod unfazed

Ford shrugs throws his towel around his neck like a
scarf and dives through Same thing Bent twisted

He runs after Ford stops at the door turns like hes
about to board Air Force one gives a salute jumps in

Arthur finally gets his legs to move steps up -- but
hesitates at the threshold paralyzed with fear unable
to take a step Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut

No No Nooo

He bangs on the stone slides his hand around like Zaphod
did desperately looking for a way to open it He
collapses and buries his head in his hands

across the field at the beautiful double sunset He looks
over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying
toward one of the giant stone doors They slip through a

Arthur rises cautiously moves over to Slartis side

SLARTIBARTFAST
I must warn you We are about to pass
through well a sort of gateway thing It
may disturb you It scares the willies out

He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and
presses The stone dissolves revealing once again the

jet engine swirling vortex Slarti motions -- after you
Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in

Yeah I kinda like this

She take the gun from him

TRILLIAN

ZAPHOD (CONTD)
Of course youre edgy your planets been
blown up and youve been tooling around

CLICK She shoots him again

ZAPHOD (CONTD)
You actually wanted to know the Question
because you always thought there was more

you find out there really isnt

Shes getting angrier and more hurt CLICK

ZAPHOD (CONTD)
Youve got no home no family no one to
be with -- and youre stuck with me
another in a long line of men who doesnt
appreciate you because hes too busy
appreciating himself

Hearing this puts a lump in her throat causes her eyes

Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off
realizes what he said and doesnt like it

Earthman you must realize that the planet
you lived on was commissioned paid for
and run by mice It was destroyed shortly
before the completion of the purpose for
which it was built Ten minutes later we
would have been free and clear But we
gave them our standard ten million year
warranty and they have come here to
retrieve this back-up copy And theyve
brought you with them

mice do you mean the little white furry

creatures with the cheese fixation

SLARTIBARTFAST
These creatures you call mice are merely
the protrusion into our dimension of hyper-
intelligent pan-dimensional beings The
whole business with the cheese mustve

been a front They were experimenting on
you you see A vast computer program

ARTHUR
Ah I see where youre confused You see
-- we were experimenting on them

SLARTIBARTFAST

Oh I gather they arranged for you to
conduct some primitively staged
experiments so they could prod your

They really are very clever hyper-

The platform slows to a stop Arthur steps out and is

stunned to see

Zarking incredible

They cant seem to stop eating like theyve been
drugged

Hosts attack you -- And then you sit
down for -- is that tea

Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table He hurries to
it feels it Warm He pours a cup takes a sip
Closes his eyes enjoying it
ARTHUR (CONTD)
Now thats a cup of tea

FRANKY MOUSE (0S)
Were glad you like it Earth creature

He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a
silver platter

BENJY MOUSE
After ten million years on Earth anda
rather large chunk of that time in

if we didnt know how to make a decent pot
of tea

Arthur stares in shockcant speak

Arthur these are our hosts Benjy mouse
and Franky mouse (chew chew)
They control a large sector of the
Universe in our dimension (chew chew)

Im sorry I thought you were told about
the mice

Yes Yes I was I just wasnt quite

prepared for the full reality of it

He steadies himself on the table

shamelessly but once we learned you were

universe it was important that we get you
here by any means necessary

Weve spent a considerable amount of time
on your planet trying to find this
wretched Ultimate Question and the
thought of doing it all over again on
account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me
to no end Which is why youre here

Sit Earthling Sit

Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him

BENJY FRANKY
NOT THERE
Arthur jumps The others look up Benjy and Franky

cover their outburst with a smile

BENJY MOUSE
This chair is much more -- comfortable

Benjy makes a motion The chair he pushed out before
slides over behind Arthurs knees making him sit

He slides the cup of tea over Arthur takes a sip

ARTHUR
Mmmm This really is delicious

Good Glad you like it Now -- to

Sorry Thought you were proposing a
toast

Ford and Zaphod eat Benjy turns to Arthur Smiles No

one notices through the window a row of Vogons cresting
the hill

BENJY MOUSE
About this Ultimate Question You see
weve been offered a quite enormously fat
contract to do the 5D TV chat show and
lecture circuit and quite frankly were
very much inclined to take it

HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8803

O3a 103a

FRANKY MOUSE
But - and heres the point - we have to
have product Which means we still need
an ultimate question

BENJY MOUSE
Or at least one that sounds ultimate

FRANKY HOUSE
Yes Got to sound good

ARTHUR
An Ultimate Question that sounds good
From a couple of micefor a chat show

FRANKY MOUSE
And as it turns out the chances are
astronomically high that the structure of
the question is encoded in your brain
Which is why we need it More tea

Franky tries to pour more tea Arthur stops drinking a
little woozy Did he hear them right

ARTHUR
Im sorry -- did you just say you need my
brain
BENJY MOUSE
Yes To extract the question

ARTHUR
You cant have my brain Im using it

FRANKY MOUSE
Barely

BENJY MOUSE
We can replace it if you think its
important An electronic brain maybe

FRANKY MOUSE
A simple one should suffice Who would
know the difference

ARTHUR
I would

FRANKY MOUSE
No you wouldnt We could program you not
to

Dont worry You wont feel a thing

The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur
Arthur still attached to the chair backs away

Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot

out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain

Wait a minute JUST WAIT A SODDING
MINUTE

The scythes and arms stop spinning Arthur stumbles
backwards and sits down in the chair The others stop
eating and listen

You want the question that goes with the
answer 42 How about Whats six times
seven Or How many Vogons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb Or heres one
How many roads must a man walk down

BENJY MOUSE
Hey thats not bad

Through the opposite window (in much the same way
bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons
arriving

Fine Take it Theres plenty more where
that came from because my head is filled

They try to lift the POV gun but its way too heavy
Arthur his butt still strapped in the chair leaps over
to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg
of mutton He raises it high Benjy and Franky look up

FRANKY MOUSE
Oh shit

Arthur brings the mutton down squashing them flat

The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze
Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut

An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it Amongst them

barrage of fire continues Trillian drops the POV gun
goes back for it Arthur stops her and pulls her behind

twisted and taught He leaps up and runs towards

towel held like hes going to whip someone on the ass
