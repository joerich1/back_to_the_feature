EXT PACIFIC ISLANDLANDING CRAFT - DAY

MAJOR JOHN SKEEN 27 sweaty and unshaven struggles for ballast
in a landing craft (LC) tossing through heavy seas When the
craft dips WE SEE the objective a jungle beach front

The LC is packed with FIFTY US ARMY INFANTRYMEN mortars
cannons and ammunition boxes ROCKETS SOAR overhead BOMBS
EXPLODE in the adjacent water

Skeen peers over the gunnel where more LCs make a parallel
approach to the beach He yells to the stern where CAPTAIN
CLIFTON COOK 25 stands next to the NAVAL HELMSMAN

SKEEN
Were drifting Get us further
south

COOK

Can’t do it Wind is coming right
off the island

SKEEN
I don’t give a shit -- get us south

He tries to check his map but the heaving sea slams him against
the side of the LC He steadies himself shouts

SKEEN
This is it men -- lets get ugly

The soldiers prepare their weapons some eager some wishing they
were anywhere but here The craft surges on the crest of a wave

SKEEN
We’re in the break drop it

The bow plate drops

SKEEN
Go Go Go

Men charge into the surf with MACHINE GUN FIRE zipping overhead
A few topple in the water failing to negotiate the surf with
their heavy packs Others form a gauntlet from boat to shore
passing equipment man to man Skeen saves a TERRIFIED PRIVATE
from drowning dragging him by his pack to shore They hit the
beach and bury their noses in the sand All along the beach
more infantry are reaching the beach head Materiel starts to
pile in designated areas
It’s chaos until GENERAL MARSH 42 grizzled vet marches out of
the smoky jungle toward the sea An AIR HORN SOUNDS and all
fire ceases ending the training exercise

GENERAL MARSH
(ON BULLHORN)
That was the biggest piece of shit
landing I’ve ever seen I want all
officers in HQ at twenty-one-hundred

Exhausted Skeen gets to his feet He and his buddy Cook share
a ‘what can you do’ shrug as a jeep speeds across the beach to
stop by the general An OFFICER confers with Marsh

GENERAL MARSH
(ON BULLHORN)
Men of the 31st Regiment -- you are
some lucky sons-of-bitches I’ve
just been informed that Japan has
surrendered The wars over boys

Up and down the beach infantrymen holler and hug in ecstatic
celebration Skeen falls to his knees and vomits in the sand
Cook lifts him to his feet

COOK
We made it Johnny boy we made it

They embrace

SKEEN
We’re going home

He scans the war supplies piled all around

SKEEN
Hey Cookie -- whaddya say

Smiling devilishly they grab hold of a heavy mortar and run it
toward the sea They heave it into the breakers out of their
minds with joy

EXT HOTEL MANILA - NIGHT

AMERICAN and FILIPINO SERVICEMEN stream through the doors of the
war-damaged Hotel Manila once the jewel of the Philippines

INT HOTEL MANILABALLROOM —- NIGHT
A SWING BAND PLAYS “GI JIVE” in a decorated ballroom there’s an

energy in the air that comes with the end of a long war Among
the DANCERS are Major John Skeen and partner a WAC OFFICER
Another couple swings too close bumping them -- FIRST
LIEUTENANT ROBERT PELZ 27 a dashing New Yorker spins around

PELZ
Out of my way Major

SKEEN

Snockered Pelz snatches Skeen’s dance partner

PELZ
Sorry sir but tonight I dance with
every girl in Manila

Laughing Skeen inherits HELEN WATKINS 25 an American civilian
with girl-next-door good looks and a spirited demeanor Not
missing a beat Skeen and his new partner twirl across the floor

SKEEN
End of the war beautiful girl --
does it get any better

HELEN
Settle down soldier I havent
stepped on your toes yet

SKEEN
Step all you want doll

HELEN
Are you really a major or did you
just steal those bars

SKEEN
I stole em -- from Major John Skeen
31st Regiment Artillery

HELEN
Did he see any action

SKEEN
He came he saw he conquered

HELEN
That’s what they all say

They share a laugh while spinning through a maze of couples

HELEN
When do you ship home
SKEEN
Counting the days -- I got a wife and
kid back in Baltimore plus a baby Ive
never seen What about you

A pained look crosses her face

SKEEN
You okay Wanna sit down

She shakes her head but stops dancing

HELEN
I should go

Smiling sadly she gives him a quick kiss on the cheek

HELEN
You’re a lucky man

Puzzled he watches her disappear into the crowd as the band
kicks into “IS YOU IS OR IS YOU AIN’T MY BABY” An exuberant
Captain Cook grabs Skeen and dances him across the floor

HALSEY
Oh come on Elliott If we’re
lenient with these people sure as

another war

THORPE

But when in military history did the
victors put their defeated enemies on
trial

MACARTHUR

Skeen turns to see a YOUNG LIEUTENANT hustling up the line He
shares a look with his buddy before acknowledging the summons

The lieutenant hustles over salutes then hands him a sealed
order -- Skeen opens it reads

SKEEN

BROWN

defense counsel for General Masaharu
Homma the man behind the Bataan

Skeen conceals his shock with good-natured humor

SKEEN
Excuse me sir but this must be a
mistake -- I did pass the bar but I

never tried a case in court in fact
I’ve never actually been ina
courtroom I was commissioned right
after graduation

BROWN
Well look at the bright side Major --
now you get some experience

SKEEN
With all due respect sir I haven’t
seen my family in four years

Brown offers a manila folder -- several photographs spill onto
his desk Skeen cant avoid the grizzly images emaciated
prisoners a mass grave a beheaded torso Brown tucks the
photos back into the folder and slides it across the desk
Skeen doesnt pick it up

BROWN
Is there a problem Major

SKEEN
Believe me sir a mistake has been
made -- I’m not qualified to handle
this case

BROWN
Anything else

SKEEN
Well yes sir -- I feel I’m well

prejudiced and wouldn’t provide
satisfactory defense for a Japanese
officer

BROWN
Is that everything

SKEEN
No it’s not I’ve got sixty-five
points I’ve done everything the Army

A grim-faced Skeen drives through the Luzon countryside Riding
shotgun is CAPTAIN GEORGE FURNESS 43 wire-rim glasses genial
with a calm demeanor and dry wit -- he’s reading a file

FURNESS
Donovan He was one of the judges
that convicted Yamashita Hes got
less background in criminal law than
I do

SKEEN
How much do you have

FURNESS
None

Coming around a bend the jeep skids to a halt -- a herd of
goats are crossing the road
FURNESS
Some other big hitters -- Generals

McNaught Gard and Trudeau

In the back seat Lieutenant Robert Pelz 27 the ladies man with
a healthy sense of humor from the Hotel Manila shakes his head

PELZ
Ive never even seen a general -- now
I got to face off with four of ‘em

FURNESS
Five General Basilio Valdez former
Chief of Staff for the Filipino army
And by the way a famous surgeon

Also in back CAPTAIN FRANK CODER 30 brusque with stocky
build leans out to pat a goat

CODER
Theres one for the prosecution
Valdezs brother was beheaded by the
Japs

The jeep continues on threading through the goats

PELZ
I cant figure out why they picked me
for a big case like this Ive just
been doing low level courts martial
What about you guys

FURNESS
I used to do real estate law in New
York

CODER

Last I saw a courtroom was the time I
got drunk and stole a chaplains
jeep They made me dig a hole six by
six by six then bury a match

Laughing they look to Skeen who shrugs

SKEEN
My father has an Admiralty law
practice in Baltimore -- does that

count

PELZ
(grinning)
Gentlemen -- I believe were ready

Skeen pulls to a stop at the guard house of BILIBID PRISON a
decrepit Spanish fortress He gives the on-duty MP a copy of
their orders

MP
Tough luck sir Drive ahead

Skeen accelerates into the prison yard

CODER
So how we supposed to defend this
butcher after what he did to our
guys

PELZ
I know I’d sleep better if I was
prosecuting instead of defending

CODER
I heard he used to entertain his
troops by tossing babies in the air
and spearing ‘em on his sword

FURNESS
(disapprovingly)
Funny I haven’t come across that yet
in the file

CODER
Oh yeah these nips are cruel sons
of bitches -- I had a buddy on that
March walked the whole nine yards
let the Beast of Bataan hang is what
I say

Skeen parks in the shade of the only tree left standing in the
barren terrain

SKEEN
If you fellas don’t mind once we’re
inside -- Ill do the talking

Coder shrugs a grinning Pelz half-salutes
PELZ

Major tell me Im wrong but I swear
you and I have met somewhere before

Skeen remembers but hes not in the mood He gets out of the
jeep and hands Pelz a rumpled grey suit on a hanger

SKEEN
I highly doubt it Lieutenant

INT BILIBID PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

In the dim corridors of Bilibid the four officers plus assigned
Nisei translator KISHIMOTO walk past cells holding JAPANESE
PRISONERS and FILIPINO COLLABORATORS They reach a separate
cell-block where MASTER SERGEANT WILLIAMS 30s tough and bulky
checks Skeen’s papers then unlocks a heavy wooden door

INT HOMMA’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

The defense team finds LIEUTENANT GENERAL MASAHARU HOMMA 59
dressed in his generals uniform writing at a small field desk
in his windowless cell He stands Japanese general and
American officers stare as if across a firing line He’s not
what they expected tall and powerfully built a commanding yet
disarming presence handsome

SKEEN
(to interpreter)
Okay Tell him my name is Major John
Skeen United States Army

Kishimoto does SIMULTANEOUS TRANSLATION -- Homma bows to each
attorney as he is introduced

SKEEN
This is Captain Furness Captain
Coder and Lieutenant Pelz Weve
been assigned to act as his legal
counsel His arraignment will be in
two days before a United States
military tribunal -- does he
understand what an arraignment is

Kishimoto and Homma speak rapidly in Japanese

KISHIMOTO
Yes he does

SKEEN
Good In order for us to do our job
well need to ask him a number of
questions

As KISHIMOTO TRANSLATES Pelz mutters to Coder

PELZ
I guess if you have to meet the Beast
of Bataan better here than some
jungle right

The general’s gaze falls on Pelz unnerving him

HOMMA
Im a soldier Lieutenant Pelz Not
a beast

The Americans are stunned by Homma’s precise diction and British
accent

HOMMA
The press called General Yamashita
the Tiger of Malaysia -- they had to
give me a contemptible name too It
makes for a good headline

CODER
GIs gave you that name not the
press

HOMMA

Forgive me but I haven’t spoken
English for several years

(ironic smile)
There was a war so I’ma little out
of practice

Unsure how to interpret this comment Skeen gathers himself

SKEEN
Do you want to conduct this interview
in English

HOMMA
As you wish -- I’ve already spoken
with two American Army psychiatrists
and some officers from the
prosecution

FURNESS
The prosecution

HOMMA
At Yokohama They questioned me for
two weeks

FURNESS
(to Skeen)
Thats illegal Defense counsel
(MORE )

FURNESS (CONTD)
should be present when prosecution
questions an accused

HOMMA
In Japan this would be common
practice

CODER

Well I’ve got news for you bud --
you aint in Japan anymore

Homma offers Coder a half smile

SKEEN
Captain Coder see if we can get
transcripts of those interviews

Homma picks up a sheaf of papers from the desk

HOMMA
Gentlemen please if you will
permit I wrote some notes in
preparation for my defense

He motions for Skeen to sit at the table for the others to sit
on his bunk -- no one accepts the invitation

HOMMA
Firstly I wish to thank the United
States Army for providing your
service and thank you for your
impartiality in taking my defense

Skeen and Furness share a raised eyebrow

HOMMA
Every commander has his own way of
discharging duties What is good in
one country may not hold as much good
in another Especially Oriental way
is vastly different from Occidental
one and American way is not our way

CODER
That’s for damn sure

HOMMA
Whether I discharged my duty rightly
or wrongly should be judged by persons
who understand and appreciate our way
Nevertheless I have tried

SKEEN
Okay thanks -- may I

Homma gives him a look before handing over his valuable ream of
notes

HOMMA
I have tried to respond to the
accusations against me

SKEEN
We’ll be sure to read this

HOMMA
Major please one other concern I
have a son in the army Masahiko He
is missing in China since 1942 I
wonder if you could help to locate him

SKEEN
If I can find the time

Skeen hands the notes to Furness then takes the suit from Pelz
and gives it to Homma

SKEEN
Youll wear this at the arraignment

Homma lays the suit on the bunk His disdain is obvious

HOMMA
I admired General MacArthur I thought
of him as a good soldier and was quite
satisfied to have fought against him
for my honor But now -- why must he
rob me of my self-respect

SKEEN
This was a decision by the
Commission not MacArthur

HOMMA
I think you are naive Major

SKEEN
(irritated)
Maybe that’s my problem because I’m
having trouble trying to figure out
how to defend you against the charges
-- bayoneting beheading burying
alive

HOMMA
(imperiously)
Major Skeen your own American army
its discipline worthy of the highest
(MORE )

HOMMA (CONTD)
praise committed hundreds of crimes
in Japan during the first months of
occupation

CODER
Son of a bitch

He makes a move toward Homma but Skeen steps between them

HOMMA
- including rape robbery murder
SKEEN
That’s got nothing to do with this
HOMMA
Sorry -- I believe no American
commander is awaiting trial for these
crimes
SKEEN
Are you telling me you excuse this
behavior
HOMMA
I do not
SKEEN

Then help me understand why so many
atrocities occurred under your
command

HOMMA
(flaring)
Major did you lead an army into
battle

SKEEN
Ill ask the questions

HOMMA
Men can do terrible things they would
never contemplate in the peace time
Its a kind of insanity Some
allowance should be made for this
state of mind

He picks up the despised suit and hangs it from a crevice in the
cement wall

HOMMA
If you don’t mind I am feeling very
tired

Dismissing his attorneys Homma lies down on his bunk None too
happy Skeen goes to the door and raps impatiently

SKEEN
Have it your way General

The attorneys file out of the cell Homma hears the door lock shut

years his junior

at another then turns again

with a tilt toward the emotional
artistic which they claim is an
unusual profile for a career officer
in the Imperial Army

FURNESS (VO)

MacArthur

In the DEFENSE OFFICE Pelz rechecks the file

PELZ
Oh yeah -- and he likes to sing in
the shower

SKEEN

(smiling)
Okay thanks Lieutenant
(to Coder)
You got a problem with your watch

CODER
I was detained but so what -- this
case is a fuckin joke

There’s a tension around the table which Furness tries to diffuse

FURNESS
John if you don’t mind I’d like to
spend a few days looking at case law
I think we may have some legitimate
questions pertaining to chain of
command
SKEEN
On what basis

FURNESS
The charge says he failed to control
the members of his command -- that’s

not saying he did something it’s
only saying he didn’t do something
I’ve got more law to look at but
something here doesn’t sit right I
think the army is opening up a huge
can of worms maybe even more than
they realize

Skeen and Pelz nod respectfully at the analysis

SKEEN
That’s good George keep us posted
Id like you to also handle the charge
of refusing to accept Wainwrights
surrender Bob you take the open
city charge All of us can work on
the Death March and mistreatment of
prisoners at the camps -- thats where
the bulk of the specifications are
So Captain Coder -- did you discover
anything in the prosecution’s Q and A at
Yokohama

CODER
He repeats the same bullshit he wrote
down on paper has a comeback for
nearly every specification Just one
more sneaky Jap trying to save his
yellow ass

An uneasy silence prevails

FURNESS
You know Frank -- it might make it a
little easier if you tried to think
of it as not defending the enemy but
simply upholding the law

CODER
You learn that crap at Harvard

Furness shakes his head with a wry smile

PELZ
I learned it at CUNY but hey try
this one -- every beast is presumed

innocent until proven guilty

CODER
Maybe that works for guys who spent
the war pushin’ papers around some
desk but not

SKEEN
That’s it Coder we get your point --
and this is mine
(gives folder)
You’re on your way to Tokyo to track
down witnesses and go through
archives at the War Ministry

CODER
Not a chance

SKEEN
Maybe you’re not listening my friend
-- that was an order

A smiling Coder looks away watches the army personnel positioning
the last desk in the corner

CODER
Okay Major -- anything for the war
effort

PELZ
Hey Frank really make a run for
that General Wachi -- he was Homma’s
Chief-of-Staff

CODER
Yeah sure When I find him I’1l
run a bamboo shoot right up his ass

SKEEN
Look Coder none of us want to be here
so just do the job

CODER
I’ve been doing the job from Leyte to
Mindanao this is nothing to me --
what about you Major where did you
serve

Skeen clenches his jaw doesnt answer

CODER
Right You’ll get your witnesses

He grabs the folder and goes In the awkward silence the
irrepressible Pelz raises his hand

PELZ
Can I go home now

SKEEN
(trying to smile)
Sure -- go see Colonel Brown about
getting yourself replaced

PELZ

I tried that already

Yeah -- me too

Anyway Major next time I pour

SKEEN
(shaking hands)
Colonel there is one thing Some of
us were a little concerned that Homma
was interviewed in Yokohama without
defense counsel present

MEEK
(laughing)
Oh come on Major -- did you
actually think I was going to sit on
my hands when we’d just captured the
most notorious criminal of the war

SKEEN
It’s a question of fairness sir

MEEK

(smiling)
‘Fair’ Is that what you just said
Major Fair Because if it is I
would ask whether your General Homma
thought about fairness when he forced
75000 soldiers to march eighty miles
with no food and no water under a
tropical sun for days on end and
subject them to the most heinous acts
of torture

He taps a stack of affidavits on a desk

MEEK
Ive got a hundred stories here but
they all end the same way

He pulls a few off the top

MEEK

(reading)
I watched two Japanese soldiers
strip a GI of his watch canteen
wallet and finally his belt When he
started to resist one soldier jabbed

Was that fair Major

MEEK
Oh heres a good one

On the second day of the march
outside Balanga I saw

haggard faces decrepit boots bedraggled American soldiers
stumbling along a hot dusty road Riding in an open truck on
their way to the front laughing Japanese soldiers swing their
rifles like baseball bats knocking marchers to the ground

On Skeens face shaken

Further trying the court’s patience Skeen again confers with
colleagues When Homma stands Skeen looks up in surprise The
general offers him a reassuring look then picks up the table
microphone -- a HUSH falls over the courtroom

HOMMA
I plead not guilty

The GALLERY ERUPTS in protest Skeen struggling for ballast
glares as Homma sits back down

DONOVAN
This Commission will reconvene in two
weeks -- on the 3rd of

FURNESS
Sir excuse me please but we would
like to place before the court a motion
to postpone trial for two months in
order to locate and interview
witnesses most of whom are now in the
United States China and Japan

Across the aisle lead prosecutor Meek confidently stands to
address the judges

MEEK
May I remind the Court of General
MacArthur’s mandate to proceed
expeditiously

DONOVAN
Motion to postpone denied Major
Skeen do you have anything else

SKEEN

No sir
DONOVAN

This Commission will reconvene
PELZ

May the defense say one thing more

sir
Skeen looks with annoyance at his colleague

PELZ
Sir these incidents occurred over
three years ago It is the
tremendous amount of research and
investigation

DONOVAN
I understand that The Commission
will now be in recess and reconvene
on the 3rd of January 1946

The generals depart as Skeen steamrollered gathers his papers
without returning the concerned looks of his co-counsel

FURNESS
What do you think Major

SKEEN
I think three days ago I was on my
way back to Baltimore

He indicts Homma with an accusatory glance then shoves papers
into his briefcase The general shakes his head in dismay
before MPs lead him out a side door

EXT HIGH COMMISSIONER’S RESIDENCE - DAY

JOURNALISTS confront Skeen with QUESTIONS as he exits the
courthouse Waving off their queries he starts down the steps
passing a GROUP OF REPORTERS including New York Times
correspondent ROBERT TRUMBULL gathered around prosecutor Meek

MEEK

General MacArthur wants to send a
message to the whole world that
Japanese war mongers will not be
tolerated in a civilized society

(a look to Skeen)

and we’re confident that all
patriotic Americans feel the same way

TRUMBULL
Youll ask for execution right
MEEK
I can tell you this boys -- it won’t

be three weeks in Shangri-la

EXT TOKYO - DAY

Tokyo - 24 December 1945
Coder drives his jeep through the shattered remnants of an urban
neighborhood staring at the pitiful sight of REFUGEES living in
its skeletal remains When the jeep stops at a checkpoint
Coder is surrounded by ragged children begging for handouts He
shoos them away and continues on
INT TOKYOWAR MINISTRY - DAY
CAPTAIN SANGER leads Coder down a corridor filled with US ARMY
PERSONNEL and JAPANESE BUREAUCRATS They enter a small office
where SONOKO 25 pretty and demure waits nervously
SANGER
This will be your office for the next

few weeks Sorry its not bigger

Coder drops his briefcase on the desk

CODER
Better than a foxhole
(pointing at Sonoko)
Whats this

SANGER
This is Sonoko Sasaki The Colonel
thought you could use an assistant

CODER
Dont need it Im kind of a one man
show here

SANGER
Unless you speak Japanese a
translator is pretty much a necessity

Sonoko avoiding eye contact stands and bows Grunting Coder
sits at his desk and starts pulling papers from his briefcase

SONOKO
Excuse please Captain Coder but I
wish to thank you for this honor
Before the war I studied English at
the Iowa State

CODER
(ignoring her)
Thats great

SONOKO
I was asked to search for General
Hommas 14th Army records

CODER
Well good -- that should keep you
busy

She picks a box off the floor and puts it on Coders desk then
points to a dozen others stacked in the corner

SONOKO
It is the full archive including
orders of each day medical records
and all court martial

Coders unable to conceal his surprise Sanger gives him a see
what I mean look

SANGER
Ill let you two get acquainted If
you need anything just give a shout

After Sanger departs Coder glances at his new assistant

CODER

Underneath a huge Red Cross tent Skeen scans through paperwork
at a make-shift admitting desk FILIPINA NURSES assist PATIENTS
both American and Filipino with their physical therapies a
small group of CHRISTMAS CAROLERS stroll among the beds --
theres a spindly Christmas tree in the corner

HELEN
Hey Major

He turns to see Helen Watkins dressed in Red Cross uniform and
carrying a tray of blood samples

SKEEN
Well hello there
HELEN
Dont you remember our dance
soldier
SKEEN
Oh yeah -- Hotel Manila What are

you doing here

HELEN
Im a volunteer I can empty a
bedpan with the best of them My
names Helen Helen Watkins

SKEEN
John Skeen

HELEN
I know I saw your picture in the
paper yesterday What’s all this
about you and the war crime business
I thought you were practically home

SKEEN
I was until the army suddenly
decided I was a lawyer

HELEN
The trial hasnt even started yet and
youre already famous

A new arrival passes by on a stretcher -- she checks to see the
identity of the patient

SKEEN
Dont remind me -- reporters from all
over the globe movie cameras I
mean everybody and his brother is
watching this thing and Im a guy who
doesnt even like to get his picture
taken

HELEN
Better get used to it

A FILIPINA NURSE arrives with a chart

NURSE
Sir -- I’m sorry but the patient
youre looking for Captain Koznicky
died several days ago

Skeen closes his briefcase

SKEEN
(to Helen)
He was an aide to General Wainwright
actually sat at the table when we
surrendered to Homma at Corregidor

HELEN
He wouldn’t have testified for you --
Peter hated the Japanese they
tortured him

SKEEN
Was he a friend

HELEN
(nodding)
The one thing I really try to do at
this place is look out for the Bataan
vets

SKEEN
Its about time somebody did Well
listen I better get going My lifes
a little crazy right now -- tracking
down witnesses case law putting an
office together it’s endless

HELEN
I think you’re working much too hard on
this -- after all he’s not called the

Beast of Bataan for nothing is he
INT HOMMA’S CELL - DAY

In a rage Homma tears the blankets off his bunk and throws the
ragged futon against the wall Hes stomping on his bedding
when the cell door opens -- Skeen stands in the threshold

HOMMA
Bedbugs

He tosses the futon and blankets back on the bunk then invites
Skeen to sit at the desk

HOMMA
Its good youre here Theres much
for you to learn about this case and
we have very little time

Skeen offers a caustic smile irritated by his clients didactic
manner

INT BILIBID PRISON CORRIDORHOMMAS CELL - DAY

Sergeant Williams carries two cups of coffee down the corridor
unlocks Hommas cell then enters Homma sits at the desk
swatting mosquitos and calmly answering questions while Skeen
alone with the enemy for the first time cant sit still

SKEEN
General King turned over all vehicles
to your forces on the day of surrender
in Bataan -- why didn’t you use them to
help transport the prisoners

Williams places the cups on the desk and leaves

HOMMA

This is a good question In the last
days of fighting the American army
intentionally destroyed most
vehicles We had no parts for
repair

(slight smile)
The 14th Army was by no means
mechanized Our primary transportation
was walking and bicycle I even had to
purchase 3000 Filipino ponies

Skeptical Skeen makes a note on his clipboard Homma hands a
coffee to his attorney takes the other for himself

SKEEN
Explain to me who was in charge of
the transport and feeding of
prisoners

HOMMA
That was General Kawani

SKEEN
Where do we find him

HOMMA
He’s dead Committed seppuku after
the surrender Suicide

Skeen shakes his head in disgust

HOMMA
But you should talk to General Takatsu
-- it was his responsibility to carry
out the order

SKEEN
Takatsu
(flipping through notes)
He’s a witness for the prosecution

Homma cant hide a look of betrayal

HOMMA
Im not surprised This isa
difficult time for us -- everyone is
afraid they are the next one to be
arrested

SKEEN
Okay what about specification 4

(reading)

‘Widespread raping and brutal
mistreatment of American and Filipino
women throughout

Homma stands manifesting his full stature as an Imperial General

HOMMA
I prosecuted every case of rape
brought to my attention we court-
martialed over one hundred men If
my conscience wasn’t clear do you
think I would have given myself up to

HOMMA (CONTD)
the Americans It is not the way of
the Japanese to be alive with shame

SKEEN
So tell me this -- did you and your
conscience ever meet up with 1200
American soldiers marching to their
death on the East Road

HOMMA
(CURSES in Japanese)
I was fighting a war in Corregidor
not supervising prisoners

SKEEN
Let me advise you of something -- if
you get angry like this in court
the prosecutors will bury you

He abruptly goes to the door knocks
HOMMA
Im simply trying to explain my

feelings concerning these charges

SKEEN
Your feelings are irrelevant

The general shakes his head in frustration The door opens but

Skeen hesitates -- Hommas staring at him tears welling in his
eyes
HOMMA
Major Skeen -- youre not the only

one who wants to go home
Skeen hovers surprised by Hommas display of emotion

SKEEN
Lt Pelz will come by this afternoon
to discuss your decision to bomb
Manila after General MacArthur
declared it an open city

HOMMA
Its a false charge -- MacArthur was
warehousing materiel for his troops

there

Skeen departs Homma angrily sweeps his papers off the desk

EXT WACK WACK CLUBVERANDA - NIGHT

With the SOUNDS OF SWING echoing from the club Helen gazes out
at harbor lights at night the devastation of Manila isn’t so
visible Skeen carrying two beers threads past OTHER COUPLES
to join her at the railing He shows her a coin

SKEEN
Look what I got back in change -- a
Japanese yen Want a souvenir
HELEN

He takes aim and fires -- the coin pings the helmet of an MP on

the street The guard looks around wondering where it came
from Skeen and Helen smother their laughter

Bedlam Helen and Skeen share a smile then kiss -- she’s more

passionate than he expected When they part he sees that she’s
crying

HELEN
I’m sorry I didnt I just didn’t
think another year would get by

SKEEN
Helen what’s the matter

HELEN

That’s why I’m in the Philippines

The celebration swirls around them as the BAND PLAYS Auld Lang

A platoon buddy said he saw Tommy at
the start of the March near
Mariveles but somewhere along the
road he disappeared -- back up to

either I find him or they give me
his dogtags

He opens his arms and gives her a comforting hug She looks
over to Pelz whos got a girl in each arm -- he kisses one
then the other long and hard She can’t help but laugh Skeen
taps Pelz on the shoulder

SKEEN
Happy New Year Bob -- dont forget
to come up for air

Pelz surfaces his face smeared with lipstick

PELZ
Ill breathe tomorrow Tonight Im

He plants a wet kiss on Helen

SINGING along with the BAND he claims a kiss from every woman
in the club Furness emerges from the raucous crowd throws an
arm around Skeen and Helen

Hey kids welcome to 1946

INT BILIBID PRISON - SAME

CAMERA DRIFTS down a corridor past despondent prisoners to find
Homma on the floor under his bunk -- hes carefully prying a
long splinter of wood off the frame He sits against the wall
feels the pulse of his carotid artery then presses the wooden
dagger against his neck From down the hall a SINGLE VOICE
begins to SING in JAPANESE Homma hesitates his eyes welling
as he listens to the emotional New Years song

INT WACK WACK CLUB - LATER

Skeen and Furness feeling no pain sit shoulder to shoulder at
the bar At the far end a group of REPORTERS are SERENADING
TWO pretty FILIPINAS

FURNESS
This is our ticket to bigger things
John better not muck it up This is
the biggest trial you and I will ever
see

SKEEN
Too bad were up against the best
lawyers the army can find

FURNESS
Dont worry we got your back you
got good personnel What we lack in
experience we make up for in
something due diligence well do it
right

He offers his glass Skeen clinks

SKEEN
Even if the guy is guilty as sin

Furness shushes Skeen while pointing to the nearby journalists

FURNESS
(to the bartender)
Another round Captain

FELIPE the Filipino bartender refills their glasses as Pelz
three sheets to the wind rolls up to the bar with FELICIA an
alluring 25-year old

SKEEN
Hey there he is where you been

PELZ
(squeezing Felicia)
Lots of investigating gentlemen if
you get my drift

FURNESS
Thank God youre on our team

The defense team is laughing when COLONEL WILLIAM LECK 40s a
hardened combat vet approaches the bar

LECK
Skeen -- I want a word with you

Their laughter stops as all glance at the hostile stranger

SKEEN
You are

LECK
Colonel William Leck 21st Field
Artillery Regiment 21st Division
You got a lot of nerve coming here

SKEEN
Excuse me

LECK
Im one of the Battlin Bastards
Ever hear of us

SKEEN
Of course let me buy you a drink

LECK
I’m not gonna drink with any goddamn
shyster -- I just want to hear you
say to my face that Jap son-of-a-
bitch isnt guilty

He shoves Skeen hard -- Pelz and Furness try to step between
them

LECK
Go on say it say it to my face

SKEEN
Colonel believe me I know you men
went through a lot but

LECK
(another shove)
No goddamnit you don’t know --

LECK (CONTD)
traitors like you ought to have that
uniform burned right off their backs

Skeen lunges but Furness hugs him from behind pinning his
arms Before Pelz can restrain the colonel Leck throws a hard
punch knocking Skeen and Furness to the floor The bartender
blows a whistle

LECK
You piece of shit disgrace get up --
I’ll kick your ass to hell and back

Skeen scrambles to his feet and tackles Leck -- a full-scale
brawl ensues as MPs swoop into the bar

EXT MANILA STREET - LATER

Skeen and Furness both drunk and bruised stagger along a city
street littered with New Years carnage and other STRAGGLERS
An ACCORDION ECHOES from a small bar

SKEEN

Armys fault they kept me teaching

FILIPINAS motion them inside

know why

Good night Captain

He salutes then enters the adjacent door as the Filipinas
engulf Furness Skeen staggers up a flight of stairs to his
spartan APARTMENT where he collapses on the couch

EXT BILIBID COURTYARD - DAY

Standing in a cramped courtyard under a gray sky Homma COUNSELS
FIVE JAPANESE PRISONERS -- they listen raptly When one man
covers his eyes in despair Homma puts a hand on his shoulder
comforting him

INT DEFENSE OFFICE - DAY

Both hung over and sporting bruises from the night before
Furness writes amid a stack of books while Skeen studies a
witness list with MANNY 50 a Filipino investigator PRIVATE
ROY 19 the secretary bangs away on a typewriter

SKEEN
Private -- you mind going a little
easier on those keys

PRIVATE ROY
Yes sir

Pelz hustles up the stairs into the office

PELZ
Come on Major we’re running behind
I got the jeep out front

SKEEN
Im not going anywhere -- especially
with you
(pointing at Furness)
Or him for that matter

PELZ
Remember Felicia Wack Wack Club My
work paid off

SKEEN
Congratulations Bob I’m happy for
you

Pelz grabs Skeen’s elbow and maneuvers him toward the door

PELZ
Lets go sir -- she helped me
wrangle a meeting with the ex-mayor
of Manila and for this we should not
be late

As they go out Pelz kisses his fingers then pats the ass of
the Betty Grable cut-out tacked to the wall

EXT JEEP (TRAVELING) - DAY

Pelz drives on a war damaged road through an up-scale section of
Manila Suffering the bumpy ride Skeen leans out the window
pukes then settles back in his seat Pelz gives hima
handkerchief

PELZ
Youll never guess what Homma’s
favorite book is

SKEEN

Mein Kampf
PELZ

Nope one of ours -- Gone With the Wind

Frankly my dear I don’t give a damn

Laughing Pelz turns into a driveway with locked gate patrolled
by FILIPINO SOLDIERS

EXT VARGAS HOUSETERRACE - DAY

Sipping coffee on a terrace overlooking Manila Pelz questions
JORGE VARGAS 60s a white-haired Filipino aristocrat while
Skeen hunched over the rail looks out over the war-torn city

PELZ
What were your day-to-day dealings
with General Homma

VARGAS
Very little

PELZ
Would you know why Homma was recalled
to Tokyo so soon after conquering the

Philippines
VARGAS
No
PELZ

We have a report that you and the
general played tennis together ona
weekly basis

VARGAS
I dont remember

Skeen takes a seat across from Vargas

SKEEN
Look Mr Vargas were not here to
arrest you Our sole purpose is to
gain information that might be useful
in the defense of our client Please

Vargas lights a cigarette inhaling deeply

VARGAS
Do you want them to shoot me as a
collaborator It’s not a propitious
time to identify oneself with a
Japanese commander

Skeen and Pelz share a somber look

PELZ
Do you think Homma should hang for
what happened in the Philippines

VARGAS
Masaharu was a good man but I’m
afraid he is a victim of
circumstance Let me tell you
something so you won’t be wasting
your time

35 INT HOLDING CELL - DAY

Manila - 3 January 1946

In his rumpled suit handcuffed Homma stands by the window with his
forehead pressed against the bars gazing sadly toward the sea

VARGAS (VO)
«-- no Filipino will testify for him
in your courtroom

MPs unlock the cuffs then escort him down a hallway toward the
DIN of the courtroom

EXTINT HIGH COMMISSIONERS RESIDENCE - DAY

Patrolling the courthouse steps MPs monitor Filipinos simmering
behind barriers as CAMERA CRANES through the mansions tall
windows to find prosecutor Meek as he stands confidently before
the Commission judges

MEEK
The prosecution is ready

Homma watches attentively as a nervous Skeen rises from his
chair

SKEEN
Colonel Meek I beg your pardon but
if I may interrupt

Meek stares annoyed as Pelz delivers a binder to each general
saving the last for prosecution

SKEEN
- at this time defense would like
to file a motion for a Bill of
Particulars

Homma offers Furness an approving nod

SKEEN
We find these charges to be vague
indefinite and

MEEK
Major Skeen as to whether this
accused is adequately advised of the

charges against him -- to me that is
ridiculous
Homma expecting a response looks to his attorney -- Skeen is

tentative Furness comes to his aid

FURNESS
If the Court please this is not a
guessing game A man’s life is at
stake and we should know everything
they intend to show in this case
which is a fundamental right
guaranteed by the 6th Amendment to
our Constitution

General Trudeau appreciating the argument whispers something
to General McNaught who frowns Homma catches Trudeaus eye
trying to make a connection

MEEK

Your Honor the purpose of a charge
is to acquaint the accused with the
nature of the offense and it does so
here adequately clearly and justly
We allege that his troops committed
numerous atrocities and for that he
must stand trial

FURNESS
If I understand that it means that
every time a soldier commits a crime
that crime becomes the crime of the
Commander-in-Chief That is all the
charge is

Homma listens hopefully as the American attorneys exchange
volleys

MEEK
Captain Furness this is a war crimes
trial the defendant

FURNESS
I think no such manner of fixing
guilt exists in the jurisprudence of
any civilized country

SKEEN
If the Commission please we would
like to quote from some well-known
cases

DONOVAN
I don’t think that will be necessary
Major I’m going to settle this thing
right now -- the motion for a Bill of
Particulars is denied
44

Homma stares in disappointment at the presiding judge Even
Assistant Prosecutor Schwartz seems surprised by Donovans
summary judgement

DONOVAN
Major Skeen anything further from
the defense

SKEEN
(flustered)
Not at this time sir

A smug Meek watches Furness and Skeen return to their chairs
Skeen makes eye contact with Helen taking a seat in the gallery
She offers a friendly wave

DONOVAN
Colonel Meek go ahead

MEEK
Thank you I do not intend to make
an extended opening statement for
there is in possession of the
prosecution a great mass of evidence
of the cruelties the starvations
the tortures the most cold-blooded
murders under the most sadistic
conditions imaginable

Skeen sits ramrod straight feeling like a freshman on his first
day of school Homma in the adjacent chair reconnoiters the
hostile terrain particularly the stern demeanor of the five
generals

MEEK
We will show conclusively that these
atrocities were committed by the
forces under the command of the
accused with his knowledge and with
his consent that as Commander-in-
Chief he could have prevented these
violations of war but failed to do
so that therefore the guilt and the
responsibility for the commission of
these violations rest squarely on the
shoulders of Masaharu Homma

CAMERA SETTLES on Homma trying to suppress the anger rising in
his face

MEEK
For these crimes the prosecution
will demand the conviction of this

MEEK (CONTD)
accused carrying with it a sentence
of death

CAMERA TRACKS across the grim faces of the judges to the
elevated witness box where MAJOR GENERAL TOSHIMATSU TAKATSU uses
a pointer to indicate the route on a large map of Bataan
Assistant prosecutor Schwartz questions the witness SERGEANT
YAJIMA TRANSLATES

TAKATSU
- the plan was to march the
prisoners from Mariveles to Balanga
a distance of 19 miles -- this is
considered an easy day’s march for a
Japanese soldier From Balanga we
can move prisoners by truck 33 miles
to the railhead at San Fernando

SCHWARTZ
General Takatsu tell us the plan
from San Fernando

TAKATSU
Use freight trains to move men north
30 miles to Camp O’Donnell

SCHWARTZ
What about food

TAKATSU
Prisoners would eat their own rations
on first day Then same as Japanese
half ration

SCHWARTZ
How did you plan to provide for the
sick and wounded

TAKATSU
Establish field hospitals at Balanga
and San Fernando and ‘resting places’
every few miles along the route

SCHWARTZ
Isn’t it true sir that this plan of
trucks equal rations field
hospitals resting places was a
complete fantasy from the outset

Homma shakes his head offended by Schwartzs sarcasm

TAKATSU
I don’t think so

SCHWARTZ
In fact General Homma knew there
would be no adequate food no
adequate water no adequate medical
attention did he not

Homma expecting an objection looks to his attorney -- Skeen
feeling his gaze stares back

PELZ
Objection -- calls for speculation

DONOVAN
Sustained

SCHWARTZ
Did General Homma show any interest
whatsoever in the prisoners of war

TAKATSU
I don’t understand

SCHWARTZ
Sir the question is quite simple --
how much interest and consideration
did General Homma have for the
prisoners of war

Takatsu shares a resigned look with his commander

TAKATSU
I think he was very much concerned
over the prisoners but I do not know
the details

A seated Meek hands Schwartz a document WHISPERS instructions
Schwartz approaches the witness

SCHWARTZ
For identification I show you
prosecution’s Exhibit number 6 dated
10 December 1945 and I will ask you
if it bears your signature

TAKATSU
Yes

When Pelz sees that Skeen again isnt going to object he jumps
to his feet surprising all with his stridency

PELZ
Whoa hold on there -- how is it that
a witness says nothing to indicate he
(MORE )

PELZ (CONTD)
is hostile and now out of a clear
blue sky an affidavit is given to
the court and introduced as evidence

SCHWARTZ
This witness was a staff officer of
the accused a potential hostile
witness

PELZ
Sir this is an entirely new doctrine
of law which is being perpetrated on
the court today

Skeen is intrigued by his colleagues argument until its
punctured by Donovans brusque ruling

DONOVAN
Just a minute -- I think the
Commission is perfectly capable of
deciding for itself what someone is
trying to do to it We will accept
the document into evidence and give
it whatever probative value we see
fit Major Skeen is there any
question about that

SKEEN
No sir

DONOVAN
Proceed

Pelz shares a disgusted look with Furness as he returns to his
chair

SCHWARTZ

Paragraph 3 of this document signed
by this witness reads as follows

(reading)
‘I can say that if these things
happened that is the atrocities on
the “Death March” and other
brutalities by the Japanese against
American and Filipino prisoners of
war it was due to the fact that at
the time interest and consideration
for prisoners of war was thin from
General Homma on down’

(to Skeen)
Your witness

He returns triumphantly to his chair Homma rivets a withering
glare on his former staff officer Takatsu sits with bowed head

unwilling to look in his direction Skeen shuffles his notes

then stands tentatively to do the cross
FURNESS
If it please the Commission defense
requests a recess at this time

DONOVAN
Ten minutes

Skeen caught off balance returns to his chair

INT HOLDING CELL - DAY

Furness and Pelz watch an angry Homma pace the room
mind elsewhere stares out the window toward the sea

HOMMA
My order was to treat the prisoners
in accord with the Geneva agreements

FURNESS
All right But what did you do to
make sure the order was carried out
by your subordinates

Homma levels Furness with a chilling gaze

HOMMA
Nothing It is not the practice in
the Imperial Army for the Commander
to follow behind his officers and
make sure they carry out their
responsibility That’s the officers
duty not the Commanders

Skeen turns back to the room

SKEEN
Unfortunately the Japanese military
system isn’t on trial here -- you
are

HOMMA

I refuse to admit that I failed to
discharge my duty as Commander-in-
Chief because I did not interfere
with my staff officers

An MP sticks his head in the door addresses Skeen

MP
We’re back sir

Skeen

his

The MP takes Homma away The others start to follow but Skeen
remains at the window intimidated by the prospect of litigating
on a world stage

FURNESS
You all right John

SKEEN
I don’t know I’m feeling a little
queasy
Furness and Pelz share a look
FURNESS
Why don’t you let me handle the
cross you do the next one
A chagrined Skeen nods then trails Furness and Pelz out the door

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Homma seems relieved when Furness replacing Skeen stands to
cross-examine Takatsu

FURNESS
General Takatsu what were your
duties at the time of the Bataan
surrender

Takatsu hesitates before responding

TAKATSU
I was in charge of the prisoners of
war

FURNESS
I see -- you were in charge In what

condition did you find the prisoners
of war at that time

Skeen studies Furness at work

TAKATSU
There was nothing especially
noticeable about them

FURNESS
Did you make any report to General
Homma

TAKATSU
There was nothing special to be
reported and I believe I did not make
any reports to him

FURNESS
Is it the practice of the Imperial
Army for the Commanding Officer to
supervise the actions of his
subordinates

TAKATSU
I do not understand

FURNESS
Was it General Homma’s responsibility
to supervise your handling of the
prisoners of war

TAKATSU
No

BETTY ROLLINS 26 attractive blonde transcribes the court record
her fingers flying over the keyboard as Meek rises from his chair

MEEK
Was the East Road the Death March
Road visible from General Hommas
headquarters

TAKATSU
I do not think so

Meek picks a document off the table approaches the witness

MEEK
Because your memory seems a little
hazy let me help by referring once
again to your statement signed and
sworn at Los Banos on 10 December 1945

PELZ
(rising)
If it please the Court I would like
to inquire whether this man has been
offered immunity in exchange for
testimony against his commanding
officer

MEEK
How dare you

Donovan slaps his hand on the table

That’s it Lt Pelz the Commission
will accept the testimony of this
witness and give it whatever
probative value we see fit Colonel
Meek carry on

At the defense table Homma is frustrated by Donovans hostile
rulings He leans past Skeen to whisper to Furness

HOMMA
What is probative value

FURNESS
Demonstrating proof or evidence

SKEEN
It means whatever they can use to
convict you

Homma returns a sardonic smile Meek hands the affidavit to the
witness

MEEK
General Takatsu please tell the
court how far the East Road was from
General Homma’s headquarters at

Balanga

TAKATSU
Approximately 500 yards east of the
road

The judges are attentive aware of the import of the testimony

MEEK
And now I will ask you again -- was
the Death March road visible from
General Homma’s headquarters

Yes

An ANGRY MURMUR ripples through the gallery Helen fanning

Pelz sneaks

SKEEN
Theres no question we need to
address it Theyve got hundreds of

PELZ
How are we supposed to cross-examine
a piece of paper It’s a complete
violation of due process

FURNESS
At least we have the law on our side

SKEEN
Bob Ill need to get your notes I
want to present in court on Monday

a look with Furness

FURNESS

I still want your notes

PELZ
Of course

MANNY
Went out over the AP worldwide --

Frowning they scan the article

PELZ
I can’t believe this -- they already
got him convicted over a piece of
geography

SKEEN
Well -- his headquarters was 500
yards from the road

HOMMA

FURNESS
Whats the difference how far it was
Its not like they were going to
commit atrocities under their
generals nose

Holding the paper aloft Pelz calls to Trumbull and other
JOURNALISTS seated two tables away

PELZ
You guys don’t call this journalism
do you
TRUMBULL
(grinning)

We dont write the headlines

Pelz strides with a stern look to their table

PELZ
(imitating Donovan)
Well gentlemen -- I guess we’1ll just

have to accept this for whatever
probative value we see fit

He pretends to wipe his ass with the paper then tosses it on
the table -- the journalists burst into laughter

clipped accent An ARMY STENOGRAPHER takes notes

PIGGOTT
Nanking was just another word for
hell-on-earth The Japanese 10th
Army burned raped and looted for ten
days without pause And this is
hardly conjecture -- in 34 I was
military attaché in China

CODER
General Piggott sir what was
Homma’s role in the massacre -- was

he 10th Army staff

PIGGOTT
Bloody hell

In his PRISON CELL Homma tries to clean his shoes with a dirty
rag and water

PIGGOTT (VO)
he was the only officer who went
to Nanking on his own recognizance
mind you and personally disciplined
the field commander of record He was
outraged by the comportment of the
Japanese soldiery

In the CONFERENCE ROOM Coder shares a skeptical look with the
stenographer

PIGGOTT
That MacArthur’s now trying him on
these insidious charges
(searching for words)
Well the irony’s absolutely
staggering

CODER
Irony I beg your pardon sir but
similar atrocities occurred on his
watch in the Philippines

PIGGOTT
Captain Coder let me explain
something -- I’ve known Masaharu

since we served together in the First
War I consider him one of my dearest
friends There is no way on God’s
earth he is guilty of these charges

Coders surprised by his passionate defense

CODER
Then I assume you’re willing to go to
Manila and testify

PIGGOTT
I’d consider it a duty anda
pleasure Believe me there’s more
than a few back in England who join
me in praising you chaps for the job
youre doing

CODER
Yeah well an orders an order

PIGGOTT

Jolly right Let’s hope your efforts
are not in vain shall we

They shake hands salute then Piggott departs

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Homma fidgets with the sleeves of his suit as Meek approaches

the Commission with affidavits

MEEK
The prosecution offers into evidence
Exhibits number 7 and 8 which have
been marked for identification being
the affidavits of Sergeant

PELZ
If the Commission please we will
object to the introduction of any and
all affidavits

MEEK
Sir the atrocities in this trial
happened three and four years ago
Many affiants are not able to appear in
this courtroom some have died if

DONOVAN
Hold on Colonel
(glaring at Pelz)
I would like to ask Major Skeen if he
has taken up with the members of his
staff the regulations governing the
conduct of this trial

SKEEN
Sir we realize it is within the
discretion of the Commission to admit
evidence of this type however

Homma stops fidgeting when Pelz bolts out of his chair and
plants himself in front of the Commission

PELZ
Gentlemen please it is shocking to
anyone trained in Anglo-American law
to try a man by affidavit and
deposition

MEEK
I don’t know where counsel for the
defense studied law but

PELZ
to sentence a man to death
because of statements made by other
men who never appear before the
court As Americans we are outraged
at the thought that one of ours could
be summarily dealt with by our
enemies How can we then deny this
defendant the right to confront the
witnesses against him

MEEK
(pointing)
Are we going to allow this accused
this war criminal to hide behind
technicalities

PELZ
Technicalities Without cross-
examination defense counsel is
crippled

Skeen and Homma are both surprised by his vehement demeanor

FURNESS
(rising)
If the Commission please Article of
War 25 as stipulated by the United
States Congress expressly forbids
depositions in a capital case tried
before a military commission

Donovan confers with McNaught and Gard who nod agreement

Homma nods

MEEK
Is it possible that anyone in this
courtroom is still unaware that the
Articles of War do not apply to this
Commission

FURNESS
Thank you that is exactly the
problem -- this Commission is not a
legally constituted court of law

staring at the judges as if willing them to agree

FURNESS
Only the President of the United
States can prescribe the procedure
for military commissions Because
the President has not done so this
Commission is required

DONOVAN
All right that’s about enough -- I
would like to say right now that this
Commission will function under the
rules governing the trials of war
criminals published by General
MacArthur Supreme Commander of the
Allied Powers About that there can be
no question The objection is not
sustained Affidavits will be allowed

Homma slumps in his chair Skeen looks accusingly at Pelz and
Furness as they return to their chairs believing that their
strident approach assured a defeat Meek positions himself near
the defense table as if reading for Homma’s benefit Homma
stares straight ahead unflinching

He then made the other seven members
of the family kneel and one by one he
chopped their heads off with his sword
and let them lay on the ground

A bloody sword slashing the air again and again

staggers out of the line A Japanese soldier runs after him
stops aims and fires

McConnell to halt before they killed
him

BALDASSARRE (VO)
No they never do such things in the

shoot you It’s just a life They
just want to take a life away

The shot knocks McConnell off his feet -- he falls face forward
in the dirt

ask that it be stricken

General did you order anyone in your
command to abuse prisoners of war

HOMMA
(sighing)
My orders were to treat all prisoners
humanely and honor Geneva convention
That was my command that was my
sincere wish

SKEEN
Did you know your troops were
committing atrocities up and down the
East Road

HOMMA
I did not know

SKEEN
Do you feel you are responsible for
what happened during the Death March

Homma ponders before answering

HOMMA
When a boy goes out and does wrong
won’t the policeman come to the house
and seek out the father

It’s Skeen’s turn to ponder

Homma nods

SKEEN
But that father isn’t punished for
his son’s crime I’m sorry -- Im

your attorney and I can’t comply with
your request to change the plea

HOMMA

I can not go back to that courtroom
SKEEN

You must sir -- if you’re not the

tell them so

FURNESS

He is a student of many disciplines

Skeen peers at a framed case containing a MILITARY MEDAL

TOKUGAWA

tea set places it on the table

SKEEN
Thank you Mrs Homma for seeing us

everything ready for the time when
Masaharu can return to us

Skeen nods Fujiko begins to pour

FUJIKO
You heard Hisako at the piano

SKEEN

FUJIKO
She was embarrassed you were
listening

SKEEN
Gee I hope not -- Id love it if my
girls could learn to play like that
someday

FUJIKO
Ah you have a family

SKEEN
We have two daughters

Fujiko looks to Coder

CODER
Ive got a wife and a little boy

FUJIKO
Then you can appreciate the
difficulty of this time

SKEEN
Yes we can

FUJIKO
They would not let us see him since
the day he was arrested

CODER

FUJIKO
What is tough
Tokugawa translates IN JAPANESE -- she nods readily
FUJIKO

Ah tough yes thank you Major
John Skeen Captain Coder what do

happen I can only promise well do
our best to defend your husband

Tokugawa and Fujiko speak IN JAPANESE

FUJIKO
We are fortunate to have you

She bows her head respectfully

SKEEN
Mrs Homma -- we would like to
request that you come to Manila and
testify on your husbands behalf

She looks to Tokugawa

TOKUGAWA
Im sorry but for Fujiko this can
not happen In our culture it is
not acceptable for a wife to appear
in public in this way

Fujiko and Tokugawa speak in JAPANESE Frowning he shakes his
head

SKEEN
General Piggott weve arranged for
you to sit up front with the pilot
You should be more comfortable there

PIGGOTT
I have some rather disappointing news
London just issued a directive --
under no circumstance should a British
officer testify for the war crime
trials in Japan or the Philippines

CODER
Says who

PIGGOTT
The Prime Minister But Im afraid
this has more to do with my
particular case as I rather doubt
anyone else is anxious to testify on
behalf of a Japanese officer

The disappointment weighs heavily on the American defenders

He salutes

SKEEN
Why would Churchill care

PIGGOTT
I dont know but the timing
certainly smacks of politics Im
sorry gentlemen More sorry than
you know Tell Masaharu Im thinking
of him All the best

then rolls up his window and the Rolls drives off

SKEEN
Son-of-a-bitch

CODER
It didnt take em long to put the
kibosh on that one

They return to the stairway where Sonoko is waiting

SONOKO
Captain Coder sumimasen -- I dont
think we will see each other again

CODER
Probably not Thanks Sonoko for
all your help Much appreciated

Skeen watches as she gives Coder a small gift wrapped in tissue
paper

SONOKO
In the beginning I was afraid of you
and all American army Thank you for
your kindness

Unsure what to say he bows awkwardly Smiling she returns the
bow

SONOKO

a raised eyebrow

time
CAMERA CRANES through the mansions front doors
78 INT COURTROOM - DAY

to find Skeen as he rises from his chair determined
forgetting his lack of experience

SKEEN
defense counsel will introduce a
motion to dismiss all charges

Helen stares stone-faced as a shock wave ripples through the
gallery Homma his heart racing watches Pelz deliver a copy

of the motion to a confounded Commission and outraged
prosecution attorneys

SKEEN
We move that this case be dismissed
for the following reasons -- one

that the evidence provided by the
prosecution does not support said
charges rendering them moot and
without merit

Donovan puts his hand over the microphone and WHISPERS urgently
to Generals McNaught and Gard

SKEEN
Second that this Military Commission
does not have jurisdiction in this
case because at the time of its
appointment no state of war existed
between Japan and the United States

Prosecutors read the motion Meek in disbelief Schwartz with
professional respect

SKEEN
Third that the Supreme Commander for
the Allied Powers General Douglas
MacArthur has no authority to
appoint this Commission and even if
such authority did exist the accused
is denied a fair trial in that the
military commander who ordered this
trial was defeated in battle by the
accused

DONOVAN
(standing)
Hold it right there Major Skeen I
want all attorneys in my chambers

Livid he exits as defense attorneys share a wary look Homma
offers Skeen a respectful nod

INT DONOVAN’S OFFICE - DAY

Prosecution defense and Commission generals watch Donovan his
face beet-red slam a copy of the motion on his desk

DONOVAN

SKEEN (CONTD)

judge jury court of review and
court of final appeal which is what
General MacArthur

DONOVAN
Son of a bitch who the hell do you
think you’re working for You’re an
officer in the US Army and you’re
about this far from a court-martial

SKEEN
I understand that sir but as a
lawyer appointed to defend the
accused I believe my duty is to
pursue all legal remedies including
to question the issue of jurisdiction

DONOVAN
Don’t you lecture me goddammit
Major -- your duty is to help us
determine the facts nothing more

SKEEN
Yes sir

Donovan scans the motion with a disgusted shake of his head

DONOVAN
This motion will not go into the
record as worded -- ‘defeated in
battle’ -- Jesus Christ

There’s a silence until Pelz ventures innocently

PELZ
What about ‘unsuccessfully opposed ’
sir Something like that

Donovan shares a look with his colleagues -- Trudeau shrugs

DONOVAN
(disgusted)
Fine

FURNESS
Sir regarding our contention that the
prosecution has failed to prove

DONOVAN
We’1l rule on that

so help me God I’11 hold you in
contempt -- you personally Major

Homma studies the five judges

as they take their seats

challenging them with his fervent gaze Donovan looks at the

accused with pity

DONOVAN

(V0)

is get this trial over and done

and put the sob

out of his misery

Shifting his glance he rivets a punitive stare on Skeen before

going on microphone

DONOVAN
With respect to the motion to dismiss
-- denied Is the defense ready to
proceed

Skeen takes a deep breath then stands before the Commission
He gathers himself with a look to Homma

SKEEN
If the Commission please the defense
will show that the accused is
innocent of the charges brought
against him It is our intention to
prove that any alleged offenses
committed by individual members of
the Japanese forces were not only
done without his consent but were
done without his knowledge and even
against his very orders

Coder and two MPs usher General Wachi into the courtroom

SKEEN
It will be shown that the accused
believed in the humane treatment of
civilians and prisoners of war as
opposed to the severe policy
advocated by the Imperial
Headquarters in Tokyo Upon proof of
the above facts it will be evident
that the accused cannot be held
responsible and is innocent of the
charges brought against him

ANGRY PROTESTS ripple through the Filipino spectators Helen
shakes her head in disgust

SKEEN
As its first witness the defense
would like to call General Takaji
Wachi to the stand

Reporters scribble notes and photographers shoot FLASH PICTURES
of the belligerent General Wachi

SKEEN
Were you formerly chief-of-staff to
General Homma

WACHI
Yes

SKEEN
Is it true that a plan was prepared
regarding how to handle the prisoners
of war some two weeks prior to the
surrender of the American forces

WACHI
That is true

SKEEN
And who prepared this plan

WACHI
Major General Kawani General
Takatsu Major Wada and Major
Sekigushi from the Medical Section

SKEEN
And who approved this plan
WACHI
First myself Then the commanding
general
SKEEN
Whose obligation -- strike that --

whose job was it to see to the
prisoners of war

WACHI
The chief of logistics General
Takatsu

SKEEN

As a reminder to the Commission this
is the same General Takatsu who
appeared in this court and tried to
deflect responsibility

DONOVAN
We know General Takatsu -- continue

In late afternoon the gallery listens riveted despite the
debilitating heat

SKEEN
General Wachi did any staff officers
from Imperial General Headquarters in
Tokyo come to Bataan at the time of
the surrender

WACHI
Yes

SKEEN
Who was that
WACHI
Colonel Tsuji
SKEEN
Was this officer on Tojo’s General
Staff
WACHI
Yes

Glancing at Homma Trudeau leans into the mic

TRUDEAU
I would like to know what General
Hommas relationship was to Prime
Minister Tojo

WACHI
General Homma was leader of the
minority faction who favored peace
with England and the United States
Tojo was leader of the German faction
that came to power There was much
bitterness between them

Trudeau understanding real world politics shares a sympathetic
look with Homma

SKEEN
What was Colonel Tsuji’s reputation
in the Japanese military

WACHI
Extreme right wing

MCNAUGHT
Just a moment please
(to the witness)
What does that mean -- extreme right
wing

WACHI
He believed Japan was fighting a
racial war to end western imperialism
in Asia

SKEEN
Is this the same Tsuji who ordered
the execution of five thousand
(MORE )

SKEEN (CONTD)
Chinese in Singapore in February ‘42
for their support of the British

WACHI
It was said

SKEEN
Did you hear reports of this Colonel
Tsuji visiting units along the Bataan
road

On the EAST ROAD TSUJI jumps from the passenger seat of a jeep
and marches toward a field tent Through the open flap we see
him berating a JAPANESE OFFICER

WACHI (VO)
Yes -- Tsuji had been threatening
many officers ordering them to
punish the Americans and Filipinos
with severe treatment

SKEEN (VO)
What did Tsuji mean by severe
treatment

WACHI
It means to kill He wanted to
execute the white colonialists and
the Filipino soldiers for betraying
their fellow Asians

SKEEN
How did Homma’s officers respond to
this order

WACHI
Well I heard that one commander
Colonel Matsunaga told Tsuji

MEEK
Objection this is pure hearsay

An indignant Pelz jumps from his chair

PELZ
If the Commission please I am amazed
-- this is the first time we’ve heard
prosecution object to hearsay We’ve
been objecting to it right along

DONOVAN
Overruled -- witness may answer
94

WACHI
Matsunaga rejected the order

SKEEN
Why did Matsunaga reject the order

At BALANGA HEADQUARTERS Wachi reports Tsujis activities --
Homma angrily overturns his field desk

WACHI (VO)
When General Homma learned of Tsujis
actions he issued contrary orders to
treat the prisoners with friendly
spirit and not to mistreat them

SKEEN (VO)
What about other officers

WACHI
Tsuji was persuasive He may have
had influence Wed been fighting in
the jungle for five months and
suffered many casualties our troops
were very angry

SKEEN
Do you recall the date when Colonel
Tsuji was in Bataan

WACHI
He arrived in Balanga on the afternoon
of April 10 and left on the 15th

SKEEN
Do those dates correspond to the
first five days of the march of
prisoners

WACHI
Yes

CAMERA WHIPS across blurred faces of the Commission to settle
Meek

MEEK
So let me understand this little
story of yours -- you’re telling this

Commission the reign of terror now
known as the Death March was in fact
caused by the five-day visit of a
single Japanese officer

on

WACHI
You twist my words I said

MEEK
A yes or no answer will be quite
satisfactory

Wachi’s expression reveals a contempt for the entire proceeding

WACHI
Tsuji reported directly to Tokyo he
undermined General Homma’s authority

Homma looks to Skeen confirming that the testimony is true

MEEK
So then is it your contention Tsuji
was the real Beast of Bataan and not
the accused sitting before us in this
courtroom

Neither Meek nor Wachi avert their piercing glare

MEEK
Could the witness at least tell us
where we might find this notorious
Colonel Tsuji

WACHI
He is reported missing

MEEK
Missing Well isn’t that convenient

SKEEN
Objection

MEEK
Are you sir presently under
indictment

WACHI

disheveled Skeen bustles into court He slips into the empty
chair next to Furness who gives him a disapproving look

FURNESS

Skeen smiles then addresses the Commission

SKEEN
At this time the defense would like
to recall General Takatsu to the

Whats this kid up to now

In the witness box Takatsu glares defiantly as Skeen approaches

SKEEN
Sir you previously testified that
General Homma’s headquarters was 500
yards from the East Road did you not

TAKATSU
Yes

SKEEN
And you also testified the road was
visible from that Headquarters isn’t
that right

TAKATSU

MEEK

Objection -- what possible relevance
SKEEN

If the Commission please we believe
this demonstration to be highly
relevant

DONOVAN

nub of it Major

Skeen nods to the witness Takatsu though reluctant goes to
the window

SKEEN
All right Mr Takatsu -- look to the
end of the pier and tell the Commission
what you see

Takatsu squints into the distance there’s something out there
but what The Commission members crane their necks curious

TAKATSU
I see nothing

SKEEN
Please look again

TAKATSU
Something red

SKEEN
Can you be more specific

TAKATSU
No

Takatsu returns to the stand as Skeen addresses the Commission

SKEEN

describe is in fact Lieutenant Pelz
standing at a distance of 500 yards
signaling an SOS with regulation Navy
flags

(to Takatsu)
Is it still your testimony that the
Death March Road was quote ‘visible’
from General Homma’s headquarters

Takatsu drops his chin ashamed In the gallery Helen watches

INT COURTROOM —- DAY
EXPLODING FLASHBULBS reveal Furness probing MAJOR MORIYA WADA

WADA
Rice was very scarce and General
Homma sent a wire to Tokyo and
Saigon but no rice came

FURNESS
How many requisitions were made in
that manner

WADA
Six times Finally General Homma sent
Wachi to Tokyo to demand that prisoners
be included in the Order of Battle for
the 14th Army -- this was the only way
to get food for the camps

Homma whispers to Skeen who scribbles notes

FURNESS
Was General Wachi successful

WADA
Hmmnn we asked for one hundred
thousand tons of rice but we
received only two thousand

FURNESS
How then did General Homma handle the
problem

WADA
In June he released most of the
Filipino prisoners from the camps as
a gesture of good will He hoped
they would find food with their
families

FURNESS
Were you surprised by this decision

WADA
To release prisoners of war so soon
after they were taken was I believe
unprecedented

FURNESS
Were there repercussions

WADA
The War Ministry felt his polices were
too soft Tojo relieved General Homma
of his command only one month after
his victory at Corregidor then denied
him the commanders privilege of
reporting his victory to the Emperor

CAMERA WIPES across the blurred faces of the gallery to settle

Dr Horiguchi at the time of the
surrender what was the condition of
the Japanese 14th Army

HORIGUCHI
Very poor -- malaria dysentery beri-beri

General Valdez leans into the mic

VALDEZ
Can you tell us approximately what
percentage of Japanese troops were
afflicted with these diseases

HORIGUCHI
80 percent

Skeen watches Homma cleaning his nails with the edge of a folder
PELZ

What was your situation with regard
to medicines

HORIGUCHI
For malaria we had only one-fourth of
the required quinine Medicine for
gangrene and tetanus only one-third
Dysentery diphtheria we had none

CAMERA drifts behind a column to reveal Meek cross-examining the
witness

MEEK
Out of 75000 prisoners of war
walking on that March do you have
any record or any recollection of any
more than one prisoner of war being
placed in your hospital

HORIGUCHI
I think that there were others but I
do not remember the exact number

MEEK
Would you care to make an estimate of
the total number placed in hospital

HORIGUCHI
No I cannot

What is the answer

HORIGUCHI
No I cannot

INT HOMMA’S CELL - NIGHT

Skeen enters the cell to find Homma bare-chested sitting cross-
legged in a corner peeling paint off the wall He adds it toa
ball of paint that hes shaping in his hand

SKEEN
Ive got some good news sir

He hands the telex to Homma

SKEEN
Your sons alive The Russians are
holding him prisoner in the Kurile
Islands

Emotional Homma reads the telex

HOMMA
I do not like war

SKEEN
When did you last see him

HOMMA
Five years ago before I took command
of the 14th Army He was so eager to
fight for his country

He carefully folds the telex stands and places it on his desk
then slips into his shirt

HOMMA
Fujiko and I thank you for this
kindness

SKEEN
Sir we should get to work on your
testimony

Homma motions for him to have a seat A KNOCK -- Sergeant
Williams enters with two plates of food and sets them on the
desk

WILLIAMS
Army favorite -- shit on a shingle
HOMMA

Thank you Sergeant
Williams departs

HOMMA
What will the American people think

SKEEN
What do you mean

HOMMA
In Japan it is not considered
dignified for an accused person to
defend himself The Creator knows
the truth and will make the final
judgment

SKEEN
Well General in this courtroom we
can’t trust heaven to that extent
Cmon lets eat

Homma joins him at the desk Skeen digs in but Homma just

Thirty-eight years

In COURT Skeen approaches the witness box

SKEEN
When did you assume command of the
14th Army

HOMMA
November 1941 Two weeks before I
was ordered to attack the Philippines

SKEEN
Did you choose your own staff
officers

HOMMA
No I did not I was almost the last
one chosen

SKEEN
Prior to the invasion of the
Philippine Islands did you issue an
order to the 14th Army regarding how
to treat prisoners of war

HOMMA
Of course My order was to treat all
prisoners in accordance with
international law To treat them
with a friendly spirit

SKEEN
General Homma as Commander-in-Chief
of the 14th Army would you say you
had control of the sixty-five
thousand troops under your command

MEEK
Objection Calls for speculation

DONOVAN
Sustained

General Trudeau leans into his mic

TRUDEAU
I’d like to hear the answer to that
question please

Donovan gives Trudeau a look then nods begrudgingly to Homma

HOMMA
I do not think so The most perfect
Commander-in-Chief finds himself
powerless in controlling the individual
actions of sixty-five thousand men In
my case I was given command of an army
organized by others

CAMERA TRACKS into Homma the General inspects his troops --
the gaunt faces of battle-weary VETERANS the naive bravado of
eager DRAFTEES

HOMMA (VO)
- some from the 26th Army were
veterans from Manchuko very cold-
hearted and resentful to be
transferred to the Philippines after
fighting the Chinese for many years
The rest were farm boys with no
education and minimal training

SKEEN
Did the war in the Philippines
proceed according to your
expectations

HOMMA
Far from it My order from Imperial
Headquarters was to secure the
Philippines in three weeks Instead
it took me six months I was
considered a failure We suffered
many casualties -- it was only six
weeks into the battle when Tojo took
away my best troops to fight in Java
From my original troop strength of
sixty-five thousand I was for a time
down to three thousand men I was
sure MacArthur would attack and
destroy me

SKEEN
Is it true you contemplated suicide
during that time

Unprepared for this question Homma hesitates -- CAMERA TRACKS

concept of surrender doesn’t exist

father tells him come back victorious
or die in the field If you fall
into the hands of the enemy don’t
come home at all

MCNAUGHT
Whats that got to do with the Death
March

VALDEZ

It played a part -- they despised the
American and Filipino boys for not
fighting to the death To them a
prisoner wasn’t even a human being

MCNAUGHT
I dont understand those people and
I never will

DONOVAN
Ill say this -- I see pain on his
face and that I never expected to

see
Trudeau flicks his cigarette over the parapet

TRUDEAU
The whole thing’s a goddamn bloody
mess Sometimes I think we make a
mistake looking too closely at what
men do in war-time -- better to draw
a curtain across it and forget the
whole damn thing

DONOVAN
It’ll be a long night in hell before
this war’s forgotten

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Despite non-stop questions the tropical heat and the lateness
of the day Homma maintains his composure -- the packed house
listens riveted

SKEEN
So then is it fair to say you were
surprised when the American and
Filipino forces on Bataan surrendered
only three days into the April
offensive

HOMMA
Yes we were utterly unprepared it
was chaos -- our intelligence told us

to expect twenty-five thousand
instead

CAMERA TRACKS into Homma HUNDREDS of RAGGED GIs emerge from the
jungle waving white flags and carrying their weapons overhead

HOMMA (VO)
- there were seventy-five thousand
soldiers and thirty thousand civilian
refugees twice the number of my entire
army We had no food or medicine to
give them no trucks to move them out
of the battle zone and not nearly
enough officers to supervise the
enlisted men

SKEEN
After the Bataan surrender when did
you first leave your headquarters

HOMMA
I believe it was one week later

SKEEN
During the time your troops were
moving prisoners to San Fernando did
you have occasion to travel on the
East Road

SKEEN
Sir during your time on the East Road
did you see any of your troops harm or
mistreat prisoners in any way

HOMMA
I did not

SKEEN
Were you kept informed about the
condition of the prisoners

HOMMA
A fighting Commander-in-Chief depends
on his staff to handle those details
I heard nothing until I arrived in
Manila in mid-May after the
Corregidor campaign

SKEEN
Once you arrived in Manila were you
then informed of any atrocities that
had occurred

HOMMA
No No kind of report of
mistreatment or cruelty official or
otherwise nothing to say of
atrocity reached my ears

SKEEN
Was it the intention of your
administration to rule the
Philippines by force

HOMMA
No I well understood through
Japanese experience in China the
folly of turning native peoples
hostile towards our army

CAMERA TRACKS into Skeen the doors of the prison swing open to
free hundreds of sick and emaciated Filipinos

HOMMA (VO)
It was not my intention to harm the
sons brothers and fathers of Filipino
people I sought cooperation with
Filipinos by winning their good will

SKEEN
General Homma -- did you order or
instigate the commission of any
atrocities

HOMMA
I did not

SKEEN
Did you condone any atrocities

HOMMA
I did not

SKEEN
Were you aware of any atrocities
being committed by members of the
14th Army

HOMMA
I was not

Skeen returns to the defense table pauses then turns back to

Homma

One final question -- while Commander-
in-Chief of the 14th Army in the
Philippines did you act under the
rules of war and comply with
international treaties and the Geneva
Convention

Now you testified yesterday the

important matters

HOMMA
Yes

Do you consider the treatment of
prisoners of war an important matter

HOMMA
It was one of the important matters

MEEK
One of the important matters You
previously testified that you didnt
leave your headquarters until one
(MORE )

MEEK (CONTD)
week after the Bataan surrender Is
that correct

HOMMA
Yes I went out on the 16th I
believe to Bagac

MEEK
You want this court to believe you
didn’t leave your headquarters for
one whole week

Trudeau and Valdez share a knowing glance -- they understand the
rigors of commanding an army

I was planning the attack on
Corregidor -- it was considered to be
an impregnable tunnel fortress

CAMERA TRACKS into Homma on a hill Homma looks through
binoculars at the stone fortress of Corregidor -- bombs explode

HOMMA (VO)
there was great pressure from
Tokyo to capture it quickly I was
already three months behind their
schedule

Oh -- behind schedule So when you
finally did make your trip to Bagac
will you describe the prisoners that
you saw

Coder whispers his concern to Pelz and Furness

(in COURT)
So let me understand this -- you made
three trips along the Death March
Road yet you expect this court to
believe you saw no mistreatment of
prisoners

Homma hesitates

SKEEN
Objection -- what exactly is the
question

MEEK
Withdrawn Did you see any bodies
along the road

HOMMA
No I did not But I wasnt
particularly looking for bodies
I was conducting a war

MEEK
Did you receive any reports after
the prisoners were in Camp O’Donnell
as to the number of deaths that were
occurring there

HOMMA
A report came that more than 100 a
day were dying

CAMERA TRACKS into Skeen prisoners bury prisoners in a mass
grave under the shadow of Camp ODonnell

MEEK (VO)
Did you think that was an excessive
amount

HOMMA (VO)
Yes it was

MEEK (VO)
What did you do about conditions
there yourself as Commander-in-
Chief

HOMMA
I thought I made myself clear on the
point When requisitions for food
and medicine were not forthcoming
(MORE )

HOMMA (CONTD)
I came to the conclusion to release
the Filipino prisoners as a means to
ease the situation of the camp

MEEK
But after getting this information
that more than 100 men a day were
dying you didn’t yourself
personally go to O’Donnell to see
what you as Commander-in-Chief
could do about it did you

HOMMA
As Commander in Chief I was
responsible for establishing an
administration to govern the country
fighting guerrilla insurgencies and

MEEK
Sir answer the question -- I asked
if you personally went to Camp

ODonnell

As a fellow general Donovan appears uncomfortable with Meeks
persistent attack

HOMMA
I was planning to but I was relieved
of my command only thirty days after
the fall of Corregidor

MEEK
So your answer is no We have heard
testimony that prisoners were beaten
beheaded bayoneted and shot Does
that indicate to you that the order
for the ‘friendly’ treatment of
prisoners of war that you issued
prior to the invasion was being
followed

HOMMA
I came to know for the first time in
this court of such atrocities

CAMERA TRACKS into Homma -- through his imagination we see RAPID-

head mounted on a post three men drinking from a dirty puddle

Should they have happened What is
it we’ve been listening to for the
last month

SKEEN
Objection

MEEK
Withdrawn You knew when you were
placed in command of the 14th Army
and ordered to invade the Philippine
Islands you knew what your
responsibilities were did you not

HOMMA
Yes I knew

MEEK
Did you know that your responsibility
was to treat prisoners of war
according to the terms of
international law and the Geneva
convention

HOMMA
It should be observed

team braces for the worst

Is that the best answer you can give
Are you not responsible for the
actions of your troops

MEEK
That included the care feeding the
furnishing of medicine to prisoners
of war

HOMMA
(impatiently)
Everything that happened under my
command I said

MEEK
I want to specify some of them --
would that include responsibility for
the 17000 who died on the March and
the conditions at O’Donnell where
100 men were dying each day was that
also your responsibility as
Commander-in-Chief

HOMMA
I am morally responsible for whatever
happened under my command

MEEK
I did not ask if you are morally
responsible I am asking if you
considered yourself responsible as
Commander-in-Chief for conditions on
the Death March and at Camp
ODonnell

MEEK
Were you responsible

SKEEN
If the Commission please I think the
witness has answered that question

DONOVAN

I don’t think the witness has

I repeat the same answer -- I am

morally responsible

FUJIKO
He disagreed with the war from the

politicians but no statesmen

Was he subjected to criticism for his
views

FUJIKO
Yes His views were not popular and
not welcomed People used to call
him pro-American At that time that
name was an insult

SKEEN
Can you tell us what kind of man
General Homma is

gradually to absorb his wife’s presence

FUJIKO
My husband is a man who likes to
create a peaceful atmosphere and get
inside it and live at peace within
that atmosphere and all his conduct
is based on this And for instance
no matter what troublesome affair may
have taken place outside whenever he
came back home he always came with a
smile on his face

Homma overwhelmed by memory listens transfixed

FUJIKO
I have come from Tokyo to here and I
am proud of the fact that I am the
wife of General Homma

She pauses to gather herself For a moment husband and wife
lock on each other’s gaze -- Homma fights for composure

did everything in my power to get out

of it

I understand I am the enemy

Not only that -- I had no experience

in criminal law in fact none of us
did and that was a great disservice
For you everything is at stake here
your life You deserved better sir
much better than I could ever be I
am truly sorry

Touched Homma goes to sit beside Skeen on the bunk

HOMMA
Major Skeen -- I want you to accept my
gratitude for the impartial stand you
have taken so bravely I respect
Americans all the more for your sake
You stood by justice You left no
stone unturned to give me a fair trial

SKEEN
But I’m afraid sir that I won’t be
able to change the mind of the

Homma nods sadly

HOMMA
Sometimes we begin a battle knowing
we can not win yet we fight on
because it is our duty because we
are soldiers

Skeen absorbs every word from ‘his’ general grateful for

There’s great anticipation in the crowded court -- the
overflowing gallery includes JAG brass Colonels Brown and Leck
plus many who testified including Baldassarre Ball and
Aguilar Skeen shares a look with Homma and colleagues as Meek
rises to begin his closing

MEEK
If the Commission please I ask you to
go back with me to 1941 and 1942 Let
us not consider this accused in the
light of his appearance here today but
rather when he was the dominant
victorious commander of the Imperial
Japanese Forces in the Philippines
And what do we find when we return to
that time We find the testimony of
the dead and the dying There has been
proven in this courtroom a pattern of
atrocities starting with the initial
landing on December 10th and it carried
right on through It is not that the
accused did not have knowledge of the
atrocities They were too widespread
not to be known He knew But did
nothing about it -- because

He turns on Homma with an accusing stare

MEEK
Because he did not care Never will
there be a blot on human history to
compare with the Death March that
eighty mile long path of infamy
Someone is to blame and that someone is
this accused His headquarters was 500
yards from the Death March as those
75000 Americans and Filipinos dragged
themselves past day after day within
sight of his headquarters within sound
of it If he would have cared to
listen he could have heard the screams
of the wounded and the dying

The gallery watches spellbound emotionally charged by Meek’s
oratory

MEEK
I submit that this accused by his
own admission is responsible for the
actions of his troops that he knew
or he should have known of the
conditions existing not only on the
Death March but in the prisoner of
war camps as well that resulted in
thousands of brutal deaths and
torturings He knew but he did
nothing about it -- because

CAMERA PANS slowly across the faces of the men at the defense
table to settle on Homma his gaze even

MEEK
Because he did not care General
Homma has said he is morally
responsible -- I submit to you that he
is responsible in every sense of the
word There is but one plain and
clear duty for the members of this
Commission and that is to find this
accused guilty as charged and in
doing that the prosecution expects
and demands the penalty of death by
hanging Thank you

Meek rivets a disdainful stare on Homma while returning to his
chair Skeen touches Homma’s shoulder as he finds his way to
the heart of the court He gathers himself then confronts the
five stony faces of the judges

SKEEN
‘The only good Jap is a dead Jap’
That’s a quote from the general I’ve
always admired more than any other
He said that he would return to the
Philippines and return he did And
it was on one of those beaches
coming upon the dead body of a
Japanese soldier that General
MacArthur said those famous words
It’s occurred to me that if things
hadn’t gone our way and God forbid
Japan had won the war General
MacArthur might be the one on trial
here today

POPPING FLASHBULBS the WHIR of newsreel cameras A seething
Donovan Gard and McNaught glare the blood rising in their faces

SKEEN
Members of the Commission with this
trial we are setting a dangerous
precedent If another war occurs we
face the possibility that next time we
won’t be the victor And then what
Is it possible someone who doesn’t
look like us and doesn’t speak our
language will come knocking on our
door And then will it be our turn to
answer for the inevitable cruelties of
war Will we be arrested and put on
trial for our lives Please --
consider the implications

The JAG brass and gallery listens impassively Homma riveted

SKEEN
I say to you that those American
leaders who ordered the bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki knew that
hundreds of thousands of innocent
civilians including women and
children would be killed -- but we
have not yet put those men on trial
Isn’t Homma’s real crime not that he
violated the laws of war but only
that he ended up on the losing side

Skeen faces Homma as if speaking only to him

SKEEN
Yes he did accept ‘moral
responsibility’ -- but this was not an

(MORE)

SKEEN (CONTD)
admission of guilt but rather a
profound expression of personal regret
for the things which happened in
Bataan The things which he learned
about for the first time with us
listening in horror to the atrocities
visited by one man upon another

Impassioned committed to every word Skeen appeals to the
members of the Commission focusing on the sympathetic faces of
Trudeau and Valdez

SKEEN
The prosecution would like you to
believe they’ve proved their case
but I am still asking -- where is the
evidence General Homma did not
commit any crimes nor aid in their
commission nor order them nor
condone them

The other defense counsel members listen with pride Skeen
locks eyes momentarily with an emotional Homma

SKEEN
Finally it must be stated that not
all the evidence is to be found
within the pages of the court record
In the short space of six weeks
defense counsel has become thoroughly
convinced of the sincerity and
integrity of General Homma and we are
proud to have represented him He is
a man who can do much in the coming
years to mend the wounds of war and
build the peaceful world for which we
all pray We submit that after a
careful analysis of the evidence and
in the name of American justice this
Commission must render a verdict of
not guilty

Homma nods gratefully as Skeen returns to his chair
107 INT HIGH COMMISSIONERS RESIDENCEOFFICE - DAY

Skeen waits while Betty the court stenographer pulls papers
from a file cabinet

SKEEN

BETTY
The Beast of Bataan General Homma

Skeen smiles knowingly then leaves As he comes down the
corridor he hears a VIGOROUS DEBATE He turns the corner
glimpsing the Commission generals through the partially open
door of Donovans chambers

TRUDEAU
the question is whether or not the
senior commander can be held accountable
down to the last private

MCNAUGHT
Oh come on Art -- thats no excuse
besides weve already been over the
chain of command

General Gard looks up and sees Skeen in the hallway -- he
motions with his eyes to someone else

VALDEZ
The problem here is that the
prosecution has charged him with
everything they could think of to
charge him with

Suddenly Donovan is standing in the threshold -- he closes the
door on Skeen

108 INT HOMMA’S CELL - NIGHT

Hommas on his bunk killing bed bugs when Skeen knocks and
enters the eerily quiet cell

SKEEN
You wanted to see me sir

Homma sits up on his bunk

HOMMA
Yes thank you for coming

SKEEN
Nothings back were still waiting
for the verdict

HOMMA
(nodding)
Ive been having a dream of losing
all my teeth and I wasn’t able to
wear false teeth You see there is
no way I can have a good dream here

He gets a sealed envelope from the desk and hands it to Skeen

HOMMA
Please for my children

SKEEN
Ill make sure they get it

Homma retrieves Fujikos black-lacquered case from under his
pillow

HOMMA
I have been thinking about the days
to come and realize it’s possible
they won’t return my body to Japan
It may go to ashes To the wind To
nothing

SKEEN
General let’s wait for the verdict

HOMMA
No now is the time After the
verdict they may isolate me and make
it impossible for us to see each other

SKEEN
Sir I don’t

Homma puts up his hand for quiet then proffers the case

HOMMA
Please Give this to Fujiko Unless
my body is consecrated at a funeral
ceremony I will not be able to find
my wife and children in the next life

Skeen seems reluctant Homma rests a hand on his defender’s
shoulder touching him for the first time

HOMMA
So they will know a place to find me
So I can be at peace
Skeen accepts the case

She waits for his reply but theres only an awkward silence

MacArthur nods Fujiko leaves followed by Skeen but he
hesitates at the threshold

SKEEN
General MacArthur sir I feel
compelled to make a request

MACARTHUR
Yes

SKEEN
I ask that you treat General Homma as
a solder because sir if nothing
else he is that -- he is a soldier

MACARTHUR
Whats your point Major

SKEEN
I’m asking that General Homma not
hang I spoke to the Commission and
everyone except General McNaught has
agreed but of course I understand it
requires your approval

When the photographer leaves Homma gathers some items

HOMMA
Please don’t go until I have given
you a small token of my appreciation
for what you’ve done for me and my
family

SKEEN
It’s unnecessary sir

HOMMA
I say necessary and in this battalion
-- I’m the general

They smile He begins with Coder wrapped in tissue a shot
glass

HOMMA
Captain Coder please I hope you
will accept this -- it was a gift to

me from my good friend in the British
Royal Army General Piggott

CODER
Thank you General

HOMMA
He told me it was for ‘throwing back’
scotch whiskey -- my only regret is

there were never sufficient supplies
of single malt in my country

They laugh He hands Pelz a dog-eared book Gone With The Wind

HOMMA
For you Lieutenant Pelz a man of
many words -- one of my favorite

books Gone With the Wind Please
excuse all my writing in the margin
a bad habit I acquired long ago

Pelz is moved in a way not seen before
PELZ
Thank you General Homma -- I wish I
had something to give you but

HOMMA
Will they let me take it with me

The team smiles at Homma’s dark humor
PELZ
Sir what I mean to say -- it’s meant
a great deal to me to have known you

Homma has to gather himself before responding

HOMMA
And to me All of you

He hands Furness a small tea set

HOMMA
For you Captain Furness my tea set
because well because you’re the

old dog who understood so much

attorneys for the next round of
trials

HOMMA

I hope they thank me for providing
you so much experience

They laugh Homma removes a medal from his uniform

HOMMA
Major Skeen for you I want to give
this medal which I used to give to
my bravest men in Bataan

He pins it on Skeen’s uniform
HOMMA

You are a soldier worthy of honor
and respect

Skeen swallows the lump in his throat So does Homma

SKEEN
I was told sir you wrote the poem
the inscription on the back

HOMMA
(modestly)
It is my poem

SKEEN
I’d like to hear it

The others murmur agreement Homma takes a deep breath For
him this poem embodies his love for the men he led into battle

HOMMA
‘In such a situation it should be
forgiven In such a jungle beyond
the shade of a tree disappeared
friends This should be called to
mind’

All are moved

HOMMA
Twenty thousand of my ‘friends’ were
lost in Bataan and other islands of the
Philippines It is not without
significance that I can join them now

They stare at the emotional Beast of Bataan Skeen fighting his
tears All hover awkwardly no one wanting to say good-bye

Homma lightly claps his hands twice trying to break their
somber mood

HOMMA
All right men we all have much to
do I’m sure

Homma goes to the door knocks

HOMMA
I wish you all a safe journey

The door opens With final looks they leave

Major Skeen

Skeen hovers on the threshold
