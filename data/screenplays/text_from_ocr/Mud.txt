1 INT ELLIS ROOM - PREDAWN 1
ELLIS sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed He is

wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip
struggling desperately to be a mustache

His room cluttered with junk is dark quiet and tiny A
backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him
The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie Ellis
quickly grabs it

ELLIS
Im comin out now

He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over

shoulder On his feet he slides open a window at the foot
of his bed Hes out in one motion

2 EXT HOUSEBOAT - PREDAWN 2
Ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room ona

foot-wide section of decking

He lives on a HOUSEBOAT anchored just off the bank of the

Arkansas River The boat is really the combination of a

double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together
atop large flotilla

Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat He

slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a

window VOICES come from inside
Slowly Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window
3 INT ELLIS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 3

MARY LEE takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator
SENIOR sits at a small table reading a newspaper The
mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis room

MARY LEE
I just want to have a conversation
I just want to talk about it

Mary Lee sits down across from Senior who doesnt look up
from his paper Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger
toward him

MARY LEE (CONTD)
If you dont look up from that
goddamn paper

She stops before completing the thought
After a moment Senior lowers his paper He stares across
the table at his wife He looks at her with true disdain

His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally
settling

on his cup of coffee He picks up the cup takes a sip and

sets it back on the table He raises the paper up

Mary Lees eyes soften She bites the inside of her cheek
to

keep from crying Her eyes move to the kitchen window

4 EXT ELLIS HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 4

Ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word shit

He slips under the window toward a metal carport that
covers

a boat fish cleaning station and industrial ice machine

The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick

ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla The ropes

extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees

Ellis sprints across a simple wood-planked bridge to
shore

His houseboat is one of several in a row along the
riverbank

5 EXT ELLIS RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 5
Ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt

path
Waiting for him there is NECKBONE a scrawny kid with
slicked back blonde hair wearing a FUGAZI T-shirt He sits
atop a smallish dirt bike Ellis hops on the back
NECKBONE
What the shit man
ELLIS
Suck it Drive
The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail
6 EXT RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 6
From a distance the single headlight of the dirt bike
snakes
up and down in and out of trees along the riverbank
ON THE BIKE
The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees
illuminated by the straining headlight
7 EXT RIVERBANK - DAWN 7
The boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill Now on
foot they are silhouetted against a light blue morning
sky

NECKBONE
How old is she

ELLIS
A Junior

At a collection of trees growing out of the water the boys
move branches away from a tarp covered boat

NECKBONE
Shes got nice titties You talk
to her

ELLIS
Nah

NECKBONE

Youre gonna have to talk to her

ELLIS
kills

river

I know

NECKBONE
Remind me when we get back to my
house Galens got a book on that
Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small flat-bottom
boat Ellis a foot on the bank and one in the boat
launches them out into the water

8 EXT RIVER - MORNING 8

A chunk of Neckbones greased back hair bobs in the wind as
they cruise down river Ellis steers a small 15 horsepower
motor An orange sun is coming up now

Neckbones eyes lock on whats in front of them Ellis

the motor Neckbone stands up a serious look on his face

NECKBONE
Shit
Ellis raises up behind him He takes a deep breath nods

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Your dadd kill us he knew we went
out there

ELLIS
Im not worried about my dad
killin us
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them Its
enormous
Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas a small

by comparison The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown
water and yellow foam six football fields wide

NECKBONE
What if it sinks

ELLIS
It aint gonna sink We gotta move
if were gonna make it back Set
your watch Well need a good
fifteen minutes
Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch They
take their seats Ellis cranks the motor
The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river
flinches

stop

9 EXT MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MORNING 9

The boat lurches through the murky rushing water

Neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boats edges
Ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact
against this current

The tail end of the boat swings to the right Ellis

and grabs an edge to steady himself The front of the boat
bobs toward an ISLAND in the middle of the river
Neck turns to Ellis and points

NECKBONE
THERE IT IS
10 EXT ISLAND SHORE - DAY 10

The boys splash down in ankle deep water They take hold of
the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore
Neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island
Ellis snatches up his backpack and follows

11 EXT ISLAND WOODS - CONTINUOUS 11
The island only 60 some yards in diameter is separated by

clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center
The trees make it so you cant see from one side of the
island to the other

NECKBONE
Galen thinks its been here awhile
Thinks the last flood did it
Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees They

at a deep creek that cuts across the island Neckbone looks
to his right then his left Sees what hes looking for

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Its down there
A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek Ellis starts
across

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Hold it
Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground
of

off

on

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Look
Eight feet below the tree trunk a nest of water moccasins
curl around in the creek Neckbone drops the stone on top

them The snakes fan out

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Little shits
Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk

12 EXT ISLAND WOODS - DAY 12

The boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up
Ellis cranes his neck back Awestruck

NECKBONE
So there it is

ELLIS
Yeah there it is
A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above

13 EXT BOAT IN TREE - MOMENTS LATER 13

The boys scale up the tree from low lying branches

Ellis hands on the edge of the boat gets a leg over the

side and pulls himself onto the deck He reaches down and

helps to drag Neckbone on board

They get to their feet steadying themselves on the wooden
deck Its solid They take in their new vantage point

ELLIS
It came down from up there
Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken

Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head
over He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood

NECKBONE
Motor broke off
Ellis isnt concerned with the motor His eyes are locked

a covered cabin at the front of the boat

ELLIS
Who else knows about this

room

provide

cabin

NECKBONE
Just me and Galen

ELLIS
Whats he think

NECKBONE
He dont care about it

ELLIS
Good
Ellis walks to the cabin He pushes a vinyl door open

ELLIS (CONTD)
Cause this boats ours
Ellis has to duck down to go inside Neckbone follows

14 INT BOAT CABIN - CONTINUOUS 14

Ellis stooping over makes his way into the tiny cabin

Yellow floral curtains stained with age cover a row of
windows that wrap around the top of the cabin These

an odd glow in an otherwise dark wood paneled space
There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left To
the right a mold-covered sink and mirror

Neckbone peers over Ellis shoulder at the front of the

room A small booth sits to the right across from a
miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door

NECKBONE
Its got its own shitbox
Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light
streams in He starts opening small closets and drawers
Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions

ELLIS
This is perfect

NECKBONE
Ho-Lee-Shit
Neckbone stares in an open drawer He removes a stack of
Playboys from the 1980s
Ellis smiles at him He leans back and props his foot
against the sink cabinet across from him This is home
Neckbone opens the first Playboy It disintegrates

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Aw shit
empty

As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages Ellis notices a
dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot He lowers his shoe from
the cabinet leaving a smaller muddy print of his own

He leans in to examine the larger print The impression of a
CROSS has been left in the heel

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Her tits are so small
Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the
cross marking His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin
On the table across from the toilet he notices several

cans of Beanie Weenie In the booth he sees a grocery bag
Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it

ELLIS
Neck

NECKBONE
Look at that beave You gotta see
this

Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag His fingers pull back
the edges to reveal its contents one can of unopened Beanie
Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD

ELLIS
Neck
Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze Its
FRESH Ellis freezes

NECKBONE
What

ELLIS
Someones here

NECKBONE

What
Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone

ELLIS
Someones livin here
Neckbone sees the grocery bag His eyes widen The boys are
stone frozen They listen for other sounds Silence

BEEP BEEP BEEP
Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds Neckbones hand flies
to cover the alarm on his wristwatch
NECKBONE
Shit

ELLIS
We gotta go I cant be late

15 EXT BASE OF BOAT TREE - MOMENTS LATER 15
They drop out of the tree and hit the ground running
16 EXT ISLAND WOODSCREEK - MOMENTS LATER 16

The boys feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the

creek
17 EXT ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 17
They launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat
Neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the
water Ellis slings his backpack in and joins him
Suddenly Ellis straightens up leaving Neckbone to
struggle
NECKBONE
What are you doing
Ellis stares at a muddy boot print cross in the heel
stamped in the center of their boat He looks back to the
treeline then down the shore He looks to his feet
The boys shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud
Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline
NECKBONE (CONTD)
What is it
ELLIS
(POINTING)
I saw that same boot print up in
the tree It has a cross in the
heel Somebodys been in our boat
NECKBONE
Shit Lets go
Ellis begins following the boot prints around the
shoreline

NECKBONE (CONTD)
We gotta go if you wanna make it
back

(NO RESPONSE)
Your dads gonna kick our ass
Itll take twice as long goin up
river

ELLIS
Hold it

Ellis stops and points ahead of them

ELLIS (CONTD)
Up there They stop
Neckbone takes the lead walking up to the last boot print
They appear to vanish

NECKBONE
Where the helld he go

ELLIS

I dont know
Neckbone turns and freezes A MAN has appeared in the
distance behind Ellis He stands between the boys and their
boat
Ellis notices the look on Neckbones face and turns He
flinches at the sight of the Man
MUD stands near the boys boat holding a pink childs
fishing pole with cartoon characters on it He stares back
at them and casts his fishing line into the water

NECKBONE
Shit You know that guy

ELLIS
Ive never seen him before

NECKBONE
Shit
Mud not taking his eyes off the boys slowly reels in his
line His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of
growth on his face
With a cigarette clinched he cracks a smile revealing a
MISSING CANINE He holds a hand in the air as if to wave

NECKBONE (CONTD)
Shit
Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back Mud wears
jeans and cowboy boots His filthy button-up shirt looks
like it hasnt left his body in years
He breaks his stare with the boys Continuing to reel in his
line he walks over to them

MUD
What you say
The boys dont respond Mud walks past them and casts again

MUD (CONTD)
Helluva thing

ELLIS
Whats that
Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth A tattoo of a
snakes head covers the top of his right hand Two large
cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws

MUD
Boat in the trees Its a helluva
thing
Mud continues walking down the shoreline reeling in his
bait The boys follow tentatively

ELLIS
You talkin bout our boat

MUD
Im talkin about my boat

NECKBONE
We found it

MUD
You found it with me livin in it
Possession is nine tenths of the

law
NECKBONE
So
MUD
Dont tell me you boys are from
Mississippi
ELLIS
No

They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and
spits on it Then tucking the pole under his arm he ties a
lock of his hair into a knot He finishes this process with
another cast

ELLIS (CONTD)
You got crosses in your heels

MUD
Nails Shaped liked crosses

ELLIS

MUD
Ward off evil spirits A man I
called an Indian but was Meskin

Ellis confused wont take his eyes off the man

MUD (CONTD)

They just good luck but so far

they aint been workin too well

(missing tooth smile)

Whats your name
Mud seems easy to smile which softens his otherwise coarse
look His words spill from the mouth rapidly without much
thought for punctuation Neckbone emboldened by these
facts steps forward to answer

NECKBONE

Neckbone looks at Ellis frustrated by his friend

MUD

arm and holds out a hand to shake Ellis stares at the hand
unsure He takes it reluctantly

begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in

ELLIS

Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm

Ellis studies Muds face clothes tattoos Hes thinking

his jeans revealing a PISTOL at his backside

Ellis sees this and motions to Neckbone The boys stand
their ground cautious

makes short order of the can lid He tips the can up letting
the beans fall into his mouth Juice flows down his cheeks

Mud walks to a tree branch that has grown out over the
bank
nearly resting in the water He sets a trot line from it

MUD

NECKBONE
Whatd they do

MUD
Gave me antivenom For a cotton
mouth See here
Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand He points
out
the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snakes mouth

MUD (CONTD)
Problem with antivenom is they can
only give it to you once Its
made from horse blood Your body
would reject it a second time The
cure ends up being more dangerous
than the poison

ELLIS
What happens if you get bit again

MUD
I die or just sweat it out
Neckbone not buying it looks at Ellis and taps his watch

ELLIS
We gotta go help Necks uncle

MUD

On the verge of hyperventilating he stares out the dark

light into the woods

44 EXT ISLAND WOODS - NIGHT 44

Ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island
He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the

around Nothing but trees

Ellis takes a deep breath Finding the log to cross he
shines his light down into the creek The nest of snakes
show their backs

A campfire burns at the base of the tree The firelight
illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above
Ellis his flashlight off crouches behind a tree and

the campsite There is no one there He looks into the
black forest behind him thinks of going back

A twig snaps in the distance and hes back on guard Ellis
nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the
light of the campfire

The SOUND of a guns hammer drawing back CLICKS behind him
Ellis freezes

Mud emerges from the trees a 45 extended toward Ellis
back

MUD
Ellis
Ellis still frozen slowly turns to him Mud huffs out a
laugh and drops the pistol to his side

MUD (CONTD)

Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand

ELLIS

Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the

Ellis stares at the farmland passing by outside as Mary Lee
steers the compact Toyota down a four-lane interstate

MARY LEE
Ellis I know what your father told
you last night Thats not what I
wanted I wanted to sit you down
and talk about it

ELLIS
What do you wanna talk about You

MARY LEE

Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in
front of her She slows to a stop

MARY LEE (CONTD)

Oh no I hope no ones hurt

There are flashing police lights up ahead Ellis tries to

see whats going on but cant make anything out past the
line
of cars They inch forward

MARY LEE (CONTD)
Im just saying there are two sides
to this I havent made up my mind
about anything because I want you
to be involved in my decision but
I need a change Ellis I deserve
one
As they approach the flashing lights they see three State
Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane
The STATE TROOPERS stop each car checking the trunks

MARY LEE (CONTD)

I think theyre searching people
A Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop Two other
Troopers approach her vehicle The first begins looking in
her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her
She lowers her window

TROOPER
Can you open the trunk please
maam

MARY LEE

Of course

Mary Lee pulls the lever by her knee and the second Trooper
walks around the back of the car

TROOPER
Have you picked up or seen any
hitchhikers today maam

MARY LEE
No sir
The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it

TROOPER

The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis

TROOPER

Muds smiling revealing his missing tooth

NECKBONE

NECKBONE

inching his way up Neckbone begrudgingly follows

52 EXT BOAT IN TREE - CONTINUOUS 52

Ellis pulls himself over the edge of the boat He finds Mud
sitting in the swivel chair behind the steering wheel He
writes in an open spiral notebook with a black Sharpie

ELLIS
What are you doin

MUD
Im gonna have to go back on our
deal for the boat I dont feel
good about it but I dont see any

Neckbone makes his way on board Mud has pulled a panel off
the steering column Exposed wires dangle

ELLIS
So you know about the state
troopers
He looks up from his notebook

MUD
What state troopers

NECKBONE
The ones spreadin your picture all

Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing

MUD
I didnt know about that but it
doesnt surprise me There plenty
of folks lookin for me right now

ELLIS
Why
MUD
I shot a man Killed him

Mud stands and walks to the back of the boat

follow him cautiously

The boys

eyes

Mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the
batteries and engine wiring Theres nothing left but a hole

into the trees He makes a note

MUD (CONTD)
Im sorry I didnt tell yall

Mud turns to really face them for the first time

MUD (CONTD)

165 blocked theyll have others
blocked too I wont get anywhere
in a car I want to try takin
this boat down see if we can get
it in the water

Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground They dont say
anything Mud walks back to the steering column He drops to

his knees and fiddles with the wires

MUD (CONTD)
With a boat like this I can make it
to the gulf in two days I could
get anywhere from there But Id
need a boat at least this big to
make it on open water Its got no
title no owner nobody lookin for

NECKBONE
Whod you kill

MUD
It was a bad piece of business
Yall dont need to hear about it

ELLIS

Mud sits up He looks at Ellis deciding how much to tell
MUD
Juniper made a mistake She hooked
up with a guy He was no good
His name was Hutchins Family owns
a chain of restaurants down in
Texas

ELLIS
Where were you

MUD

I was around but me and Juniper
were on the outs She met this
Hutchins he sold her on some lies

He dropped June down a flight of
stairs after whoopin her half to

things you can get away with in
this world and things you cant I
tracked him down at a motel just
outside of San Antonio He was
there with another woman Thats
where it happened

Muds done with his story He goes back to the wiring

MUD (CONTD)
I understand if you cant help me
anymore but I need this boat And
I need to get it in the water fast
After a moment he sits up and wipes sweat from his
forehead

MUD (CONTD)
Ive made a list Things well

Ellis takes time to consider everything He looks at
Neckbone who has a disgruntled look on his face

ELLIS
You did it for her To protect
her

MUD

Yeah
Ellis nods Mud looks over at Neckbone who still has the
disgruntled look on his face

MUD (CONTD)
What do you think

NECKBONE
I think you want us to run around
stickin our necks out gettin
everything you need just so you
can take our boat

MUD
Thats about it
Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter

NECKBONE
What do we get out of it

MUD
What do you want
Neckbone looks to Ellis judging his bargaining position

NECKBONE
What about that pistol
Mud eyes the boy pulling on the nub of cigarette

MUD
I only got two things out here

Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans Neckbone
tenses but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm

MUD (CONTD)

And this pistol I cant give you

the shirt ‘cause I need it for

protection but if you help me get

this boat in the water the

pistols yours
Neckbone squinches his face in thought sizing up this

trade

NECKBONE
What kind is it

MUD
A forty five
NECKBONE
I guess we could work a deal like
that
Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol but Mud puts it
back in his jeans

MUD
We get this thing floatin first
Neckbone looks over at Ellis who shrugs

NECKBONE
All right then

Mud smiles flashing his missing tooth He spits in his
palm

and holds it out to Neckbone Neckbone not sure about

taking the spit hand reluctantly shakes

Mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to Ellis

MUD
Yall scrounge what you can off

ELLIS
Tom Blankenship
Mud has smoked down to the filter He crushes the butt into
his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket

MUD

ELLIS

They continue down the rope Mud continues his work

53 EXT SHELLYS OXBOW - DAY 53

bend in the river that holds he and Tom Blankenships

You know why hes stuck out on that
island

ELLIS
Yeah

(HESITATES)
He shot somebody

TOM
He tell you why he shot that man

ELLIS
Because he hurt Juniper

TOM
Right The real reason Muds in
the trouble hes got is because of
her Hes been in love with that
girl since he was your age They
used to run all around here and it
was the same back then Hed
follow that girl wherever she led
him Problem is she dont care
about nobody but herself Ive
told him as much Shed bed down
with the meanest snake she could
find then when things went bad

shed go runnin to Mud Mud would
take her back then go find
whatever unlucky sonofabitch last
put a hand on her and beat “em ‘til
they knew to never touch her again
And this time I guess he thought a
beating wasnt good enough Had to
shoot that fella I dont know for
sure but Id put money on Juniper
nowin hed do it And I have a
suspicion she might of even told
him to Either way those two are
set for failure Only chance Mud
has is to cut her loose Cause
Ill tell you what Muds no bad
ass Hes runnin scared
Ellis cant look Tom in the eye hes offended by the old
mans remarks Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk

ELLIS
I gotta go
Ellis heads for the door but stops short

Ive never took a thing from you
that I couldnt provide for on my

you out of my life for good
She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis
MARY LEE (CONTD)

Ellis Youll return that motor

from where you found it and youll

apologize in person to the man you

took it from I wont hear about

Mary Lee walks to the front door She collects her purse and
keys and exits quietly

Senior and Ellis stand in silence which feels even more
uncomfortable than the shouting Ellis finally speaks

ELLIS

I cant take that motor back But

Ill pay him for it Ill pay him

what he wants for it
Senior stoic pivots his body away from the boy

SENIOR

I dont care what you do Ellis

Senior retreats to the bedroom Ellis is left alone in the

From the ground Ellis can see that Kyle is big and
considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before

converge on them

pavement Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him
Another punch to Ellis face May Pearl is out of the car
and yelling

MAY PEARL
Kyle Stop it Kyle

May Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar By his own will he
raises off of Ellis keeping an eye on him

A streak of blood stretches from Ellis nose to his ear He
gets to his feet dazed

Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle Kyle
smiles and turns to his friends who laugh The CROWD that
has collected consists of older high school guys and girls
