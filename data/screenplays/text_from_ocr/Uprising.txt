A US aircraft carrier slices through dark seas

INT COMBAT DIRECTION CENTER — CARRIER - NIGHT

A comms screen goes blank It didnt lose power it just

WIDER to reveal the windowless nerve-center of the carrier
Now another screen goes down And another And another
COMMS AND NAV OFFICERS GROAN -- this isn’t the first time
they’ve been off-line A DUTY OFFICER snaps up a phone

DUTY OFFICER
Chief we just lost half our comms
Maybe you can round up a few of your
best geeks see if they can’t plug me

The rest of the screens go down

DUTY OFFICER (CONT‘D)
Make that “all” communications

He scratches the time in his log “0315”
DUTY OFFICER

Sorry to wake you Sir-

INT CORRIDOR - CARRIER - NIGHT

Snugging down his cap THE OLD MAN stalks a corridor This
is a CO whos seen it all Twice

INT BRIDGE - CARRIER - NIGHT

The Officer Of The Deck is a late-20s lieutenant His badge
says “J STEVENS” The Old Man swings onto the bridge

THE OLD MAN

The Old Man turns back “But what

J STEVENS (CONTD)
Having trouble with our GPS-compass
It’s not locking in

An itchy beat First their comms and now this

THE OLD MAN
Put it at the top of Engineerings

even navigate anymore without the
blasted satellites

J STEVENS
Youll correct me if I’m wrong sir
butdidn’t the Vikings make it
halfway around the world without GPS

He’s planting a seed in The old Man’s head

EXT FLIGHT DECK - CARRIER - NIGHT

START on the great “island” of the Carrier bristling with
antennae now useless CRANE DOWN to include the c0 on the
launch deck stance wide wind in his face

THE OLD MAN
More right rudder more more

Polaris the north star is swinging into view on the
starboard side of the turning carrier The Old Man is
steering his four-billion-dollar ship by eye His orders
get relayed up to the bridge via a PHONE-TALKER

PHONE-TALKER
“More right rudder”

THE OLD MAN
Keep coming keep coming and

EXT FLIGHT DECK — CARRIER — NIGHT

Support personnel hustle away The Old Man and Duty Officer
zip up jackets against the North Atlantic wind Trying to
convince themselves they’re okay

THE OLD MAN
Any second now Chiefs gonna run
down here and put a blown fuse in my
hand ‘Bout one inch long Cost

and it just knocked the stuffin’s out
of 200 million in electronics

DUTY OFFICER
Or tell us that someone spilled a
Mountain Dew on his keyboard

THE OLD MAN
Sumpin’ crazy like that

DUTY OFFICER
Yeahgotta be our end right
Because the more complicated these
systems get the more they --

An ERUPTION OF WATER off the starboard beam Jarringly

close a huge black submarine slams back down to the surface

completing its emergency blow
TIME CUT TO
A flashing light It’s a louvered signal lamp circa WW2

Carrier officers are squinting at the light from the sub
jotting down possibilities comparing notes It’s been a
long time since anyone here used Morse And it shows

CARRIER OFFICER 1
(with binoculars)
Ohio class Strange configuration
though with those dry-shelters just
behind the sail
(MORE)
CARRIER OFFICER 1 (CONTD)
(realizing)
Unless Is that

THE OLD MAN
“Boat 19”

CARRIER OFFICER 1
Never thought I’d see it

To most here it’s like spotting Ahab‘s whale But The Old
Man is more interested in what that sub is saying

THE OLD MAN
(snapping fingers)
The text the text

He gets a chill when he reads the decoded message And it
has nothing to do with the Atlantic wind

THE OLD MAN
“No comms with VirginiaNORAD
DC What is happening”

EXT NORTH ATLANTIC — NIGHT

Launched from the carrier a zodiac smashes through swells
A crossing party of officers holds on grimly They’re headed
toward the sub now floodlit by lights from the carrier

INT BRIDGE - CARRIER - NIGHT

Left behind Lt J Stevens focuses on Boat 19 It means
something special to him too He checks the time on his
Luminox watch -- then flips his hand and slips down the watch-
band to reveal a private tattoo on the white of his wrist

“HOME ALIVE”

INT READY ROOM - BOAT 19 — NIGHT

A hatch opens Carrier officers drop down inside as the
SUB CAPTAIN enters Cutting short the INTROS

SUB CAPTAIN
We fired a burst communication to
Washington soon as we surfaced
No response

THE OLD MAN
Do you have anything on the L1 or L2
channel Any GPS at all
SUB CAPTAIN
Precision codes Y-codes - it all
dropped dead at 0315 You

DUTY OFFICER
Same thing Same time

A STIR goes through the compartment mostly from the sub’s
young blue-shirted crew

SUB CAPTAIN
Adults only Clear the room

EXT NORTH ATLANTIC — NIGHT

Surrounded by lonely black sea the sub and the carrier run
side by side

INT READY ROOM - BOAT 19 — NIGHT
Privately now the naval officers churn scenarios

CARRIER OFFICER 1
--CME” “coronal mass ejection”

STEVENS (0S)
I think we’re listening just fine

They all turn Standing in the shadows of the room is
TERRENCE STEVENS He doesn’t wear the Dolphin badge of
submariners He wears the Trident of a Navy SEAL

STEVENS (CONT’D)
Problem is no one’s talkin’ So let
Me just say what we’re all thinkin’
Someone hit our command-and-control
Hard
EXT CONNING TOWER — BOAT 19 — NIGHT

FOUR LOOKOUTS with night-vision sweep the sky Over the
horizon we see discharges of unnatural light Eerie light

INT READY ROOM — BOAT 19 NIGHT

SQUAWK BOX VOICE Lookouts reporting”explosion—
events” sir Port flank several
hundred miles out

DUTY OFFICER
That’s where our battlegroup is

A heart-stopped beat — then The Old Man Snatches a walkie-
talkie off his hip

THE OLD MAN
Mr Stevens copy me

J STEVENS (OSRADIO)
Bridge go

THE OLD MAN
You ring up battle stations and put
the interceptors on-deck Break off
this heading I want te come about
hard you got that son

J STEVENS (0SRADIO)
Copy that but do I wait for you --

THE OLD MAN
Negative negative you do not wait
for anything you just do it

CLOSE on Terrence Stevens - reacting to the familiar voice
on the radio His brother’s voice

EXT NORTH ATLANTIC - NIGHT

All PROPS CHURNING the carrier peels away from the sub
And behind the two vessels

More of those eerie “explosion events” light up the horizon —
“and then even more chilling they end Whatever battle
raged out there now seems over
INT RADAR STATION - BOAT 19 - NIGHT

As a blip appears on the radar screen

I WANNA DRILL A BIG HOLE IN THE

WATER NOW NOW NOW

Secure him

Stevens pounces on the ladder

EXT FLIGHT DECK -— CARRIER — NIGHT

As INTERCEPTORS SCREAM OFF the carrier

EXT DRY SHELTERS BOAT 19 - NIGHT

Lookouts are scrambling to get below passing
The Old Man He Can see the after-burners of interceptors
leaving the Carrier Desperate for a glimpse of the enemy
he snatches night-vision goggles off the last look-out
Instantly someone snatches them from him

STEVENS
Sorry sir no time Captain
requests your company below

The Old Man looks to the zodiac stored near the dry-shelters
Can he launch in time

STEVENS (CONTD)
And I am insisting sir

THE OLD MAN
That’s my ship out there

STEVENS
Trust me I know how you feel

THE OLD MAN
You got no goddamn idea how tf feel

Big dark swells rise all around them as the sub floods its
tanks Supremely frustrated The Old Man drops below

But Stevens

Stays put for a few heartbeats more dragging on the goggles

NIGHT-VISION Pov Jumping ahead of the interceptors
ZOOMING IN on that “airborne contact” to get our first

eyes-on look Even miles out the thing blots out stars

(NOTE This is the “Hunter-Killer”)

EXT NORTH ATLANTIC - nicHt

As the sub dives

INT CONNING TOWER — BOAT 19

Sub Captain bangs down handles and throws his face to the
Periscope just as

EXT BOAT 19 UNDERWATER — NIGHT

The whole ocean fills with an unnatural light from above
It’s so bright it seems to X-ray the diving sub
INT CONNING TOWER - BOAT 19

That same light fills the periscope bleeding from every
crack It blinds Sub Captain

INT READY ROOM - BOAT 19

THE OLD MAN
(to look-outs)
Who saw it Huh You WHO SAW WHAT
IT WAS

The look-outs wag their scared heads —- and defer to the last
man down the hatch

STEVENS
(to Old Man)
Wasn’t ours It wasn’t anything like
one of ours

The DIVE BELLS STOP Shocked silence gives way to a new
sound COLLAPSING BULKHEADS It’s the sound of an aircraft
carrier dying along with 5000 good men The AWFUL SOUNDS
paralyze The Old Man with grief But no one takes it harder
than

Terrence Stevens He pulls down his watch-band to reveal a
familiar tattoo the one made in tandem with his kid brother

“HOME ALIVE

EXT AIRCRAFT CARRIER — UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Surreally F-14 Tomcats and F-18 Hornets are “flying” through
the ocean in slow motion spilled from the deck of

The carrier As it chases the planes into the depths we

realize that this is only the stern Something vaporized the

front half And all along the sheared-off edges —— that
impossible cross-section of ship -- the carrier is still

burning Whatever weapon struck it was so intense that the
ship still burns even underwater

FADE OUT

OVER BLACK we hear HUMMING The melody is so soulful as to
be mournful full of haunting loss — loss of an entire way
of life The melody is AMAZING GRACE and it carries over
the images were about to see

And reveal the THRONG OF PEOPLE viding there some with
Suitcases Some with whole families Refugees

EXT RURAL CHURCH BIBLE BELT — DAY

The church is packed Worshipers spill out the front doors
and into the Parking lot SINGING HYMNS from outside this
classically steepled church Presently

SONIC Booms lift fyes Contrails grow above the steeple
The aircraft are too far away to really See but the
contrails are strange Unearthly Druuben

The Parking-lot worshipers go back to their HYMN SINGING
They’ve seen these contrails before Too many times

INT INNER CITy APARTMENT — DAY
CLOSE on a cell phone “No Service”

Hoping today will be different an URBAN MOTHER Searches her
apartment for reception She passeg a plucky SON at
his PlayStation embroiled in some hot conflict Supplying
his own Sound effects

EXT RED SCHOOLHOUSE — NEW ENGLAND - DAY

A Chevy pickup parks at a red schoolhouse framed by green
woods and a cornflower-blue sky The motto on the license
plate is “Live Free or Die”

A CHEVY MOTHER AND FATHER get out and tug-of-war over their
8-year-old SON The father doesn’t want him in school today
But the mother wins marching her son to the front doors

Chevy Father remains outside in protest A TING-TING-TING
lifts his eyes to the flag-pole where he sees

No flag today Just a lonely cable hitting the pole

Full of impotent rage Chevy Father sits on the steps of the
schoolhouse he probably attended 25 years ago He can barely
stand to listen to what’s happening inside

INT HANGAR - COMMUNITY AIRPORT - DAY

A hand flips a radio dial There is no music today no talk
radio AM or FM there is just PERSISTENT STATIC —— and then
finally a voice A voice as pleasant as Tokyo Rose

TOKYO ROSE VOICE
---NYSE NASDAC and the NEKKEI
remain inactive while undergoing
evaluation Travel bans are still
in place for those of us not involved
in essential services — but the good
news is that the main post office in
your town or city is most likely open
again for business Please pick up
your new Code of Conduct there
I’m also pleased to report that food-
distribution is flowing at nearly
60-percent of Day One Capacity and
basic staples can be found in most
markets You see as more of us

restored each and every day Again

Expanse Check here daily for more
updates

The VOICE REPEATS IN DRUUBEN The AVIATION MECHANIC snaps
the radio off Seeing a moving ground-shadow outside he
crosses to the mouth of the hangar to see

EXT COMMUNITY AIRPORT - DAY

A recon ship unlike any other It makes almost no sound as
it patrols the airfield ensuring all planes are chocked all
runways are blocked by bulidozers As the Druuben aircraft
vectors away we CRANE DOWN to include the locked gates of
the airport And a sign

“NO FLY -- ANYTIME ANYWHERE”

EXT HILLY ROAD — PENNSYLVANIA — DAY

A black FARMER motors down the roadway on his John Deer
Occasionally he steers the tractor right to let a minivan or
Honda Civie go by The farmer has a grim wave for each
Passing car aA survivors wave

REARVIEW MIRROR POV Topping a hill something dark and
hulking appears about a half-mile back Soon it vanishes
into a dip in the road

The farmer sets his jaw He hates these things Hates what
they represent

ANGLES ON DRUUBEN TRANSPORT Shovel-nosed Spiked with
antennae No windows no wheels —— it skims the road unseen
ENGINES HOWLING And it comes fast

(NOTE Call it a “Road Hog”)
CLOSE on the tractor speedometer 22 mph

In the SAME FRAME now the Road Hag appears behind the
tractor It’s big as a locomotive and twice as menacing

But instead of staying right the farmer actually drifts to
the center of the road It’s an act of fed-up defiance and
just when we think the Road Hog will plow right through the
tractorjust when the farmer regrets playing chicken

The Road Hog slows to 22 mph

FARMER
(crowing)

That’s right Uh-huh Forty years I
drive this road Should say “Willie
Tucker Parkway” right on them signs
You travel on my road you travel at
my speed And if you don’t like it
you can kiss my old saggy ass - from
the front you Druuben motherfu——

The tractor is shattering apart in gruesome SLOW-MOTION
BLASTED SIDEWAYS by something that Willie Tucker of Willie

Tucker Memorial Parkway never saw coming

Now we reveal the two Druuben gunships flying escort for the
Road Hog

Road clear the convoy continues on

EXT DRAGON FIELDS — PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE — DAY

AERIAL SHOTS PURSUE the alien convoy through wooded hills
Soon the woods give way to something else

Imagine the teeth of a 1000-foot dragon planted in the
ground Now imagine acres of these dragon teeth all leaning
“outward” away from our direction of travel Away from
something we’ve yet to see

INT ROAD HOG Day

It would be utterly dark inside the Road Hog if not for thin
air-slats along the flanks In slivered light then we make
out POWs on their knees like downed cattle They’re bound
together by heavy shoulder-yokes

EXT ROAD HOG DEPOT — DRAGON FIELDS — DAY

The Road Hog slows to a stop It joins another Road Hog
already docked Just ahead the state highway is broken
apart into huge slabs and it would be impossible for a
ground vehicle to go further That’s the point

EXPLOSIVE BOLTS FIRE on the Road Hog One whole side drops
open and slams to the ground exposing

32 POWs two rows of 16 Half-blind they crab-step into
daylight still yoked together medievally Among them we
find

Terrence Stevens
serrence Stevens

Overhead the gunships are replaced by two new Druuben
aircraft the “Dog Walkers” Hovering the Dog Walkers each
lower a cable with an articulated end The two cables snake
around like things alive searching for

Matching cables on the yokes of the two lead POWs All four
cables cobra-dance ag they line up and

SH-KINK SH-KINK Connect
In the air the Dog Walkers start moving

On the ground the POWs start walking

EXT DRAGON FIELDS — PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
The Dog Walkers gain speed

The POWs start running through the obstacle field The two
leads are Stevens and REGGIE They try to maneuver but don’t
have much slack The Dog Walkers are spreading tightening
their leashes pulling the Pows straight for

A big dragon tooth Edge-on

The two lines of POWs slam into it - and it splits their

okes right down the mid-line Like a human zipper
unzipping the Pows Pass on each side of that killer tooth

Now there are two chain-gangs of 16 Pows The yokes they
still wear have fore and aft hinge-points and that creates a
snakelike motion as the POWs get hauled onward It‘’sa
hellish game of “Crack the Whip”

Soon the POWs top a hill to behold

EXT HILLTOP RIDGE -— DRAGON FIELDS - LATE DAY

Their destination Their fate

It stands a half-mile ahead The sun is low behind it
giving the Pow camp a dark hulking look Surrounding hills
have been defoliated replanted with dragon teeth and other
escape obstacles

The Dog Walkers jerk their leashes

Stevens and Reggie run on

EXT DRAGON FIELDS NEAR POW CAMP — LATE DAY
REGGIE
(spotting something)
Oh no No no no no

Ahead is a culvert lined with smaller teeth POWs try to
put on the brakes knowing itll be like running through
lawn-mower blades But at the last second

The Dog Walkers gain a few feet of elevation

And suddenly the pows are flying over the culvert

They SLAM DOWN on the far bank Almost impossibly Stevens
lands on his feet The POWs behind him keep their balance
too But Reggie isn’t so lucky A LEG SNAPS on impact

He goes down ugly

And his whole line goes down ugly behind him

The downed chain-gang gets dragged by their yokes dragged by
their collective necks The strongest try to get their feet

back under them but they can‘t carry the weight of the whole
chain-gang And REGGIE SCREAMS all the way

EXT ENERGY FENCE — POW CAMP LATE DAY

A series of 30-foot pylons describe the outermost fence of
the camp Energy fields flow between pylons but as the POWs
approach one field vanishes The “front gates” of the camp
are being opened for

EXT POW CAMP — LATE DAY

The new POWs The first chain-gang enters the yard
Theyre half dead but still on their feet

Reggie’s gang enters like losers ina tug-of-war

The Dog Walkers circle overhead dragging the downed POWs
some more slamming them into walls and posts until
finally

It ends The forced march is over

WIDE ESTABLISHER This is a Victorian prison in disrepair
abandoned by humans long ago but pressed back into service by
the Druuben after being upgraded with their technology

EXT WATCH TOWER — Pow CAMP - LATE DAY

OATES
Catch of the day

On the walkway of a watch tower once used by prison guards
we find OATES and ERSKIN roosting over the yard These are
two of the senior POWs who run this place - the human part
of it They wear remnants of military uniforms

ERSKIN
Don’t see that too often - someone
comin’ in vertical

OATES
I’ve seen it before Once

He looks over his shoulder at COLONEL TRAPPE inside the watch
tower He’s plunging a coffee-press making himself a nice
cup of Yuban

EXT YARD POW CAMP — LATE DAY

Still breathing like race horses the new POWs struggle to
free themselves of the hated yokes Suddenly

An ENERGYPULSE fires down the leashes The PULSE cracks
open their yoke-collars

Stevens and the standing chain-gang throw their yokes to the
ground The fallen chain-gang rolis out of theirs

One newbie is COFFEY 24 a black female dressed in ragged
cammo hair pulled back in a clumsy knot serious eyeglasses
Shes trying to deal with Reggie’s wounds gushing blood

COFFEY
Need a belt a tagsomething to
shut down this artery ‘fore we even
try to deal with the rest of his
Stay with me now Reggie you stay
right here with me

None of the long-term Pows move to help They’re watching a
BIG PLATFORM RUMBLING toward the ground descending from the
alien billet built high over the camp

COFFEY (CONT ‘D)
Can I get maybe ONE CRAPpy SHOELACE
OVER HERE

OATES
Just leave him be

Oates strides into the yard Hes pure Sergeant-at-—Arms

COFFEY
“Leave him ” Hes gonna bleed out
right here unless we get him some
help some real help Wheres the
infirmary at

OATES
When they want to move him
they’11 move him Dont interfere
when they do and take a knee
Everybody Down down down

All POWs in the yard double over For the long-termers
its not bowing in the religious sense —— it’s more what
beta-chimps do around alpha-chimps Deference born of fear

OATES
When you hear the order “Troondo”
just put your left arm out like
you’re gonna give blood Do not ask
why just do it and you might live
long enough to see why

RAAB a newbie steals a look
RAAB’S POV The Druuben who ride the platform down are just

silhouettes against a half-set Sun We can only see that
they’re tall hominids with crested helmets Wait are

TRANSLATOR 1 bumps Raab

TRANSLATOR 1
(sotto)
Don’t look -- thats “Oko-Oko” a
challenge Not unless they speak
first

Stevens too keeps his eyes down -- but trained on a rill of
ground-water In it he sees tantalizing reflections of the
coming Druuben Gorgon Viewing 101 Oh and one more thing
we notice about Stevens

He’s squatting not kneeling No knee touches ground

DRUUBEN VOICE
TROONDO

POWs push up sleeves and extend arms

SNAPSHOT CLOSEUPS Druuben hands - with twin opposable
thumbs The hands speed-wrapping spiky wire around the arms
of POWs just above the elbows cinching the wires tight and
clamping them off with curious tools Pows gasping in pain
Druuben feet - with outriggers that spread to the sides for
superior balance The feet moving from POW to POW all
movement accompanied by a strange SEETHING SOUND

DRUUBEN VOICE
TROONDO

The voice barks at Stevens the one Pow not extending an arm
Stevens just cobra-spits in the direction of a Druuben boot
We aren’t sure whether he gets hit by a hand or a baton but
the net result is that they just

Lay Him out

He gets the wire anyway

INT WATCH TOWER — Pow CAMP - LATE DAY

INTERCUT Trappe up in the walkway of the watch tower He
notes Stevens -- and his attitude -- while sipping Yuban

EXT YARD POW CAMP — LATE DAY

The only POWs who don’t receive arm-wires are the fallen the
ones like Reggie who couldn‘t even make it to their knees
Now Druuben hands start grabbing these POWs dragging them
effortlessly across the ground and flinging them into

A big pit

REACTION POWs Wanting to look but hot wanting to look

RAAB
(through teeth)
Tell me this ain’t happenin’

Beside Coffey the semi-conscioug Reggie begins sliding out
of FRAME She clings to his pantleg

COFFEY
Don’t take him don’t take please
dont

Her grip is broken Reggie is taken

CLOSE on curved metal casings each four inches long
Druuben hands twist stem-caps activating timers The
casings get pitched into

The pit Activating the casings FLASH-BURN and spread a
white-hot energy over the fallen PoWs

RAAB
What the hellcouple those guys
are still

A BIG BLATTING SOUND It comes from massive diaphragms hung
high overhead

COMMANDANT’S VOICE (OS)
KRAGAMODON INKHARATE ROGOTTUN

Now spoken to POWs stand and look up at the Druuben billet
As THE VOICE quakes the diaphragms two POWs translate for
newbies The TRANSLATORS are still working out nuances of
the Druuben language

TRANSLATOR 1
(announcing to POWs )
“Your leadership has been removed °
The Great Druuben Race”

TRANSLATOR 2
“Expanse”

TRANSLATOR 1
“the Great Druuben ‘Expanse’ now
governs this land and all lands like
it You are here because you have
Challenged or threatened this fact
In time some of you will grow”

TRANSLATOR 2
“Submissive” or “compliant”

TRANSLATOR 1
“-and be returned to the main
population The non-compliant will
remain here Escape cannot occur”

TRANSLATOR 1
“Again your leadership has been
removed”

COMMANDANT’S VOICE (OS)
“VOSHAK-TOSHAK”

TRANSLATOR 1
“It had to be

POWs break formation as if coming out of a trance The
Druuben guards are gone the platform now ascending Even
though they cleared the yard of the dead and wounded we
never got a good look at them We never dared

Bloody-faced Stevens joins Coffey and others at the edge of
the pit The bottom smolders with bony ash

BAINES
There is no infirmary They think
of the wounded as weak

The longer a POW has been here the more in-grown his
arm-wire is And BAINES’ wire is part of his anatomy now
It’s under his skin

Stevens’ gaze turns to the “front gates” of the prison
The downed section of energy field is regenerating

In a zombie-daze a young newbie is walking straight for
those “gates” CORPORAL DASH can see through the energy
field and figures he can walk right through it too But the
pylons are generating new “black-nasties” - baseball-sized
clots studded with hooks and barbs And they patrol the
energy fields of the perimeter fence like wasps guarding
their nest

WORTHY
Hey Where you goin’

WORTHY wears the tatters of a Canadian Air Force uniform

DASH
Home

WORTHY
And where’s “home”

DASH
Hawaii

WORTHY

(collaring him)
Hang on hang on Why don’t you
just rest up little while before
you go an’ try to walk --

Dash shakes loose Worthy grabs him again The kid
struggles even harder Worthy decks him with a forearm
then squats to help with the resulting nosebleed

WORTHY
Head back head back You know
someday you’1l thank me for this
bloody nose

With the energy fence up and running the old prison doors
start CRANKING CLOSED in front of it

OATES
Awright little fishies listen up

cup of water and an empty bag
Drink the water judiciously as it is
hard to come by In the bag you
will place your first feces and turn

Plantings so keep your mouths shut
and your bowels open and we’ll all
get along just fine You have been
assigned to Cellblock “Charlie”

Dash rolls to his feet and runs
™ enn tO his feet and runs

WORTHY

Dash beats the closing doors and slams headlong into

The energy field Instantly his body downshifts into a
FREAKY SLOW-MOTION

That gives the black-nasties a chance to swarm and attack
And when Dash spills out the other side of the fence back
to NORMAL SPEED

The black-nasties come with him burrowing into his body and
DISRUPTING HIM on a molecular level

POWs watch in dull horror until the IRON GATES BOOM CLOSED

Now the sun winks out behind those thorny hills It brings a
series of DEMANDING BLATS from the camp diaphragms

Like Eloi heading for the cave POWs head for cellblocks

HOLD on Stevens as others vacate He stares at that energy
fence still visible above the old prison wall wondering how
to get over it Or under it or through it

EXT DRAGON FIELDS - NIGHT

From a hill in the Dragon Fields a WOLF BAYS at the moon —-
our old familiar moon now crossed by unfamiliar aircraft

INT CELLBLOCK CHARLIE - NIGHT
No heat No electricity No lights except for

“Spud lamps” From a 50-pound sack of potatoes POWs have
crafted small potato batteries copper pennies serving as one
electrode zinc nails as the other Wire runs from the
electrodes to bulbs salvaged from the cellblock ceiling

All around the dim lamps glow to life like campfires

Stevens walks this decrepit two-tier cellblock clocking the
SOTTO CONVERSATIONS of newbies and long-termers Outwardly
hes searching for an Open cell Inwardly he’s sizing up
his blockmates assessing the material he has to work with

BAINES
--held some of the worst ever this
place Capone included And none of
them ever busted out neither Mind
you this was before the Droogs came
in with new paint and carpet

There is no “escape” in the Druuben
language Just no word for it

of Iraq and the Baltimore projects But somehow she still
doesnt think of herself as good enough Never has

over of that base -—- tryin’ to find

INT STEVENS’ CELL -— CELLBLOCK CHARLIE — NIGHT

The cell is furnished with a three-legged chair a rusted-out

cot a rain-soaked mattress crawling with centipedes But
what clinches the deal for Stevens is a small window in the
ceiling 12 feet overhead It’s got iron bars

STEVENS
Sold

TIME CUT TO

Stevens hanging from the ceiling He’s managed to loop
electrical wire over a window bar The ends of the wire
are wrapped around his padded hands and he “saws” on that
bar with a punching motion -—- left right left right —-
all the while supporting his own body-weight

He’s got to get out

Yoked together eight newbies ride the platform up toward the
Druuben billet Coffey and Worthy are among them They ‘re
scared appropriately shitless

EXT YARD - POW CAMP — pay

Sudden brightness Were looking at the sky —- and two
growing specks Now a hand appears in CLOSEUP The hand
holds a mock-up of a Druuben ship made out of boot leather
and it compares the mock-up to the real Druuben ships on
approach

SPOTTER
Twin engines pulsed exhaust
clearly sub-sonic haulers so
(turning to CAMERA )
Spotter calls “Pack Rats” Inbound

SPOTTER small and scrappy has a dozen mock-ups strung
around his neck Once there were train spotters and plane
spotters Now there are alien-ship spotters

Stevens and other newbies appear in the yard just as the
long-term POWs are Clearing out The Pack Rats hover above
the camp - and release their cargo Heavy pallets tumble
through air

And CRASH LAND in the yard Seals break on impact and
hundreds of small cans fly like shrapnel

Stevens snags one out of the air The emergency ration is
stenciled “COURTESY oF USA -- FOR DISASTER ONLY”

STEVENS
Guess this qualifies

POWs emerge and start foraging for cans It’s like some
Third World Easter-egg hunt Stevens keys open his can
fingers out some hash

closer ready to help off

Those First Eight newbies They’re all down on their knees
and reluctant to move from that position They’ve been
through a night of interrogation -- Druuben interrogation --—
and just what that entails can only be guessed at by their
harrowed state

RAAB
Holy crap What happens up there

Nearby a POW punctures the bottom of his empty rat-can and
slides it across a clothes-line smacking it up against 88
other cans He is THE KEEPER OF THE CLOCK

KEEPER OF THE CLOCK
TODAYS DATE DAY 89

Stevens stoops to gather more rat-cans Now he spots
A small “oO” in the ground It’s the corroded end of an

ancient pipe flush to the ground Intrigued Stevens starts
searching for others

STEVENS
So how’s a map guy wind up here
Raab

RAAB

You find out you let me know

STEVENS
Had your maps when they Picked you up

Good ones too with all my notation
Burned ‘em all up with those little

all that down Just crushed it as
soon as it broke out

STEVENS
Well if that was true Raab you
wouldn’t think theyd go to the
trouble of building their very own
Abu Ghraib would you

Stevens finds another “O” pipe 15 feet away flush to the
surface just like the last one “Air pipes” ye lines up

the two Pipes -- then extends that line in his head sourcing
it back to

wrought-iron fence

Stevens backpedals and looks up 25 feet overhead Trappe is
Still buffing his shoes

Trappe gestures “kill it” to the minister In turn the
minister nods to a POW seated at an old pump organ who
STARTS PLAYING with more volume than skill We understand
that Trappe wants audio cover for this next part

TRAPPE
The problem we have “Mr Stevens”
is that sometimes the Druuben place
sympathizers among us

STEVENS

‘Mean “spies” Human spies

TRAPPE
Happened once already Fortunately
we picked up inconsistencies in that
POW’s story

Once that we know of

TRAPPE
Sergeant Oates I believe you know
ERSKIN
Whyd the Druuben pick you up
Stevens
STEVENS

Firearm possession

TRAPPE
Weapon violation won’t land you here

STEVENS
Well it wasn’t the weapon that they
objected toas much as the rounds I
was dumpin’ into a Droog’s chest

ERSKIN
You killed a Druuben

STEVENS
Several How many you bag

TRAPPE
(willing to ignore)
So in all the weeks you apparently
spent Kung Fu-ing your way across the
Earth did you --

STEVENS
In all the weeks you been here how
many escapes have there been

Oates punches the back of Stevens’ head

OATES
Listen up Kung Fu These officers
have given up a lot just to provide

Stevens plants a boot on the pew in front and piston-kicks
back overturning his own broken section of pew right onto
Oates’ legs pinning the guy in place while he

DRIVES A KNEE into his face

STEVENS
And I gave up my only brother to
these Droogs a guy I convinced to go
Navy a kid I swore I’d look out for
no matter what --

vanish from sight Stevens looks down -- and finds himself at
the edge of the cremation pit Trappe appears

TRAPPE
We all lost somebody in this war
Stevens And I won’t take more loses
in escape attempts that have no
chance of success

STEVENS
(re the pit)
Should bury them proper

Commandant won’t give that I know
how he thinks It won’t happen

around camp ISSUE A SERIES OF BLATS Stevens joins the flow
of POWs heading for the cellblocks HOLD on Trappe as Oates

ERSKIN
Never came clean did he

OATES
So if you think it’s a real problem
we do it like last time -- just break

They leap a span

And hook onto a leg of the camp’s 1940s-era water tower

EXT TOP OF WATER TOWER —- POW CAMP - NIGHT

START on the Druuben billet erected overhead Closer now
we can see that the lowermost level has telescope-like
protrusions around its perimeter These “telescopes” move
slowly sweeping the camp below

JOHNSON 2 (0S)
That’s where they listen So long as
we stay right here

PULL BACK to include Stevens and the two Johnsons They’re
lying on the top of the windswept water tower this the
tallest human structure in camp It’s a “dead spot” for the
Druuben listening post

JOHNSON 1
We can talk

He pulls out a scrap of paper hidden behind his belt
Scrawled on it are geodetic coordinates

JOHNSON 1 (CONT’D)
Located some decent secondary targets -
this a weapons depot in southern
Virginiathis old air base Droogs
took over outside Baltimore

JOHNSON 2
Counted 24 Droog ships just sittin’
on the tarmac Lined up all pretty
beggin’ to be taken out

Stevens doesn’t respond He’s studying the layout of the

old Victorian prison with its 20-foot stone wallinside the
30-foot energy fenceinside the endless Dragon Fields

He’s already thinking ahead

JOHNSON 1
Been workin’ on a way to smuggle
these coordinates out Gonna be a
bitch But every once in a while
they do cut someone loose -- usually
some small fish they throw back
some guy who showed he was no threat
to them in the first —-

STEVENS
Y’mean some guy who bought his way
out by doin’ favors for the Droogs
Huh-uh No way do I trust him with
my coordinates

JOHNSON 1

(piqued)
Your coordinates For

Now Stevens makes eye-contact -- and confirms with silence
Johnson 2 looks like he’ll bust loose with a war-cry so
Stevens muzzles him Soon a TORRENT OF HISSED QUESTIONS

JOHNSON AND JOHNSON
You found “Gomorrah” Where at How
far away They’re actually building
it Above ground or below One of
their no-go zones Where

STEVENS
(holding up hand)
Just get all up on this idea If any
coordinates are leavin’ this camp
They leave in our own pockets

The Johnsons trade dubious glances

JOHNSON 1
That’s a 30-foot Druuben energy fence
out there ‘tenant You touch it
you die cryin’

JOHNSON 2
And that’s before you hit the
obstacle fields Nobody knows what
kind of ruin-your-day shit they put
out there

JOHNSON 1
And may I remind you this is Day 89
Last rendezvous was scheduled for -

STEVENS
Day 100 Which gives us one whole
week to bust outta here don’t it
(off their looks)
The Prime Target That’s what I got
in my pocket

And that overrides all concerns Somewhere below them

Trappe appears having himself a smoke on the walkway of the
old watch tower Maybe it’s just a privilege accorded the
senior human officer but for whatever reason Trappe isn’t
locked down at night

JOHNSON 1
Gonna run this by him

STEVENS
Now when did Navy SEALS ever ask
permission of a goddamn Marine

JOHNSON 2
I assume that means “Fuggim”

STEVENS
Hooyah Mr Johnson Hooyah

JOHNSON 1
Gonna need certain liberties to
pull this off And one thing Trappe
does good is get concessions from
the Droogs Don’t know you can just
end-run him like that

150 feet above the yard the platform docks
An energy-pulse surges through the umbilical cracking open

nothing except slabs of woven steel until

ADOOR FLY-TRAPS OPEN right in his face
OST SRR SEEN right in his face

Too dark to see inside Stevens takes a deep breath and
hoping it’s not his last steps through

INT GENESIS HALT — DRUUBEN BILLET - Day

Purple gasses seep from fissures in the ceiling augmenting
Earths atmosphere The walls skimmed by sunlight from the
still-open door show monochromatic reliefs These arent

works of art -- the Druuben aren’t interested in art or
culture These are testaments to their own existence
And by default a record of their genesis Stevens moves
ahead warily scanning the reliefs seeing

A pre-Druuben race Not unlike primitive humans they have
binocular vision and hunt in packs Theyre capable
predators but not the most dominant species on this alien
world Then

The Volcano Epoch Endless volcanoes belching ash into the
sky Eclipsing the sun Clogging the air with ash-rain
Then

Vegetation withering Animals dropping A great die-off
Then

A bacchanalia of murder Pre-Druuben killing their own
eliminating the weak and the small and even the infantile
Culling their own herd Then

Only the strongest few pre-Druuben still standing at their
feet a Vigeland tableau of death Then

These few strong specimens evolving The eyes that no longer
serve them vanishingthose bony ridges extruding forward
those sagittal crests growing tallerthose hackles rising
up to form “Romanesque” crests Finally

A present-day Druuben warrior emblematic of all Druuben
Standing tall and hubristic like the apex Predator he now is
Surrounded by cities and aircraft reaching for the heavens
With this world underfoot the Druubens face is upturned —-
Pondering which world to conquer next

The entrance DOOR FLY-TRAPS SHUT behind Stevens Now he’s
standing in total darkness A beat -- and the FLOOR VANTSHES

beneath his feet Stevens falls

INT INTERROGATION CHAMBER - DRUUBEN BILLET — CONTINUOUS

And crash-lands in a circular chamber Just indigo twilight
here whatever light seeps out of unfathomable machinery

QUISLING Not often someone gets sent up alone
You must be special -- or especially
stupid

STEVENS
Momma thought “special” Daddy
thought “stupid” Never did get it
settled
44

A shaft of light snaps on to reveal THE QUISLING He’s a
human who wears whatever parts of a Druuben uniform will fit
his well-fed anatomy

QUISLING
Do you know why you’ve been brought
to this prison

STEVENS
Killed a Droog

QUISLING

Actually no

(off his look)
Their code of honor says it’s not
improper for an enemy to kill a
Druuben during “Vykookando” - the
Time of Conquest They’1l actually
respect you for it What they have
no tolerance for is when you try to
kill a Druuben -- and fail

STEVENS
SoI‘m free to go

The chamber starts SEETHING around him It’s like Stevens
fell into a rattlesnake pit He backpedals but

EXPLOSIVE SHOTS Shadows lifting Stevens off his feet
Body-slamming him to the ground Hauling him up jerking him
sideways locking him bodily into

A head-and-shoulder yoke -- with teeth inside Its the
Druuben equivalent of an Iron Maiden one of eight that
dangle here Dazed Stevens pants hard until

QUISLING
The only right answers will be those
that he believes

STEVENS
(dazed)
I don’t see “he”

More SEETHING -- but this is a BIG AND SINGULAR SEETHING
In response the arm-wire Stevens wears heats up the tips of
the barbs glowing

QUISLING
“He” sees you Mr Stevens

COMMANDANT’S POV Of Stevens trying to place the sound
For the first time we see how a Druuben “sees”

More light slivers into the chamber It’s just enough to
reveal the Druuben guards that jumped Stevens Theyre
imposing but nothing compared to

The silhouette that now circles the room

Stevens is transfixed Even with its crest down this thing
scrapes the seven-foot mark In a society where strength is
everything this is a bull Druuben This is Original Stock
This is the COMMANDANT

(NOTE As the interrogation ensues assume that the
Commandant is originating the questions in DRUUBEN TONGUE )

QUISLING
“You are a former member of the
former Navy of the former United
States of America correct”

STEVENS
You know his question was a lot
shorter than yours Are you askin’
the same -—

The COMMANDANT SEETHES Stevens’ arm-wire heats up again
stealing his breath

QUISLING
“Yes” or “no” please

When the pain passes

STEVENS
Look I know how it works —--— get ‘em
to bite on the easy ones then bring
the hard stuff So why don’t we just
get to it “Are you a member of any
group who seeks to challenge the
Great Druuben Expanse”

The Quisling rocks forward

QUISLING
Well
(waiting a beat)
The session will end only when you
answer your own question

STEVENS
I’1l answer only when he opens this
thing

The Quisling rocks back indolently not translating

STEVENS (CONT ’D)
Tell him Tell this big Droog
wadsucker that “the session will end”
when he proves that he aint afraid
of one POW without a weapon When he
stops showing me weakness

QUISLING
You don’t want to do that

STEVENS
I think I do

QUISLING
To accuse a Druuben of weakness is
to make an
(leaning forward
whispering it)
-Oko-Oko” - a formal challenge

STEVENS
‘Fraid he’ll kill the messenger

The Quisling hesitates He hadn’t thought of it that way

STEVENS (CONT’D)
Tell him Word for word

Reluctantly the QUISLING BEGINS TRANSLATING The Quisling
even uses the word “wadsucker” because not surprisingly it
has no Druuben equivalent

The Commandant stops circling If an eyeless being can

War-scythe on the Commandant’s hip worn where a human
officer might wear a cutlass It is ceremonial isn’t it

COMMANDANT
SHOOKSGIM

A guard moves forward aggressively -- and stomps an actuator
The Iron Maiden opens Stevens extricates himself

STEVENS
(to Quisling)
Now question for you No need to
translate

QUISLING
I do it because they will survive ail
others I do it because it is my
privilege to serve such a masterful
civilization

ROUND TWO OF EXPLOSIVE SHOTS Stevens driving an elbow into
a guard’s quadra-cles Grabbing its head Throwing it into
the Iron Maiden Stomping the actuator to snap it closed

From darkness Droogs lurch forward with weapons glinting
But they freeze at the sight of

Stevens Aiming a Druuben fist-gun at their Commandant

QUISLING
(with dire implication)
Oh I think Daddy was right

STEVENS
(to Commandant)
We believe we should have the right
to dispose of our own dead We need
to bury them okay Per gur customs
hot yours And by the way this
ain’t a challenge

He drops to his haunches -- and lays down the fist-gun

STEVENS (CONTD)
Its a gift

A heart-stopped beat We note that Stevens still won’t let a
knee touch ground

The Commandant reclaims the weapon aims it dead-bang at
Stevens

And then BLASTS THE SPINE off the guard in the Iron Maiden
The one who lost his weapon

Stevens calculated that might happen But what happens next
no one could predict The hackles on the back of the
Commandant’s head reorient toward

The other guards They break and run

The Commandant hunts them into the dark rim of the room
turning the chamber into a kill jar FLASHING FIST-GUNS
giving glimpses of things that will haunt us for years But
amid the chaos we note this The Commandant uses his scythe
to “scalp” the guards chopping off their sagittal crests
before dispensing with them Then abruptly

It’s over

Stevens forces his eyes down as HEAVY FOOTFALLS approach
Druuben boots re-enter his view -- along with the war-scythe
we realize is far from ceremonial

COMMANDANT
OKO-—OKO

STEVENS
No boss No challenge here

The COMMANDANT SPEAKS again

THE QUISLING
He says “You may start with him”

A beat of confusion for both Stevens and the Quisling --
“Whats that supposed to mean -- before the Commandant

decapitates the Quisling
Holy Fuck

Maybe he did kill the messenger Or maybe it was just a
grace note to the other killings But Stevens suspects the
Commandant did it to make a non-verbal statement “Never
come this close to challenging me again Never

Stevens bounces off the platform - and now spots Trappe

reach Schultz

STEVENS
Okay Schultzie new rule —- were

way ‘round here No more pit

SCHULTZ
“No piihht”

STEVENS

Stevens heads out but not before dropping a contemptuous
look in Trappe‘s direction Johnson and Johnson fall in step
along with other POWs who pepper Stevens with QUESTIONS
wondering how the hel he did it Clearly Stevens‘ stock is
on the rise

Oates and Erskin join Trappe They watch Stevens and his

There’s a man we call “Romeo”
Every 10 days Romeo appears at a
lighthouse Hes only there at
midnight and never for long - just
long enough to smoke one cigar from
his shrinking stock of primo Havanas

WIDE to show a bayside lighthouse ROMEO waits up in the
widows walk visible only when the great Fresnel lamp sweeps
behind him

Romeo is hoping to make rendezvous
with someone like mesomeone like

leaves disappointed he leaves
seaward rejoining a vessel that
barely escaped on Day One -- and
hasn’t surfaced since Now the
Druuben arent really sure if this
sub exists or not --

SPOTTER
(daring to say it)
Boat 19
COFFEY

What what is that

Stevens shoots a look to Johnson 1 then nods to Spotter
“Run with it”

SPOTTER

(amped up)
Technically it doesnt exist
Technically the US only had 18
SSBNs -- subs with nuclear missiles
But for years there’s been a rumor
that they’ve kept one sub out of the
budget and off the books It was so
secret it had no name just --

But it’s a boomer yeah Is Spotter
right is Spotter right

“Find it”

the lighthouse door “Romeo y Juliet” It joins eight other
cigar-bands there It says in effect “On Day 90 I was
here”

CUT BACK TO

WORTHY
Where is this lighthouse And how
many check-points you expect us to
cross to get there

SPOTTER
That is enemy territory out there

Stevens squats pulls a spud-lamp closer then uses a shank
to write the answer in the dirt “MAINE”

STEVENS
And by the way anybody who repeats
this wakes up without a tongue

And it was usually the one who talked
about it most

Trappe initials a barrack-schedule for Erskin then starts
back inside the watch tower But he stops seeing

Or is it fresher than that

Need you to beat Worthy to Romeo --
in case I can’t

RAAB
“Beat Worthy”

STEVENS
We cannot let the Droogs backtrack
Romeo to the one thing they been
lookin’ for all along Clear

COFFEY
Sir I’m just a Mechanic Fourth Class
in the National Guard ain’t really
set up to be a shot-call --
(brain catching up to ears)
What does “K” stand for

Stevens gives her the fist-gun “Exactly what you think”
A beat -- then Coffey picks up right where she left off

COFFEY (CONT’D)
---and I only signed up for Guard cuz
the vision program was better than
WalMart’s I don’t know if I can --

STEVENS
How many tours of Iraq

COFFEY
Three

STEVENS
You’ll be fine Coffey
INT SUV -— HIGHWAY - SUNSET
Worthy is at the wheel of an SUV speeding east On the seat
beside him are two items A Druuben fist-gun the one he

used to kill ”“O” team with and

An arm-wire The one he didn’t throw out of the truck

EXT MARYLAND BACKROAD - SUNSET
Reaching water Worthy’s SUV turns south

500 feet above that WHISPER-QUIET RECON SHIP makes the same
turn And even higher a gunship joins flying escort

EXT GREAT FALLS PARK - UPPER POTOMAC — SUNSET
The river is strewn with flotsam

Swimming Stevens catches onto a wooden skiff and rights it
Trappe struggles aboard with him There are no paddles so
they use whatever the waters offer up Stevens pulls out his
Luminox “1845”

STEVENS
Five hours and change
(to Trappe some heavy
shit ahead)
Guess I just assumed you’d be takin’
the hard way too

TRAPPE
You assumed right

Paddling hard they start down the Potomac

INT TRACTOR-TRAILER CAB - NIGHT

Coffey and Raab Grim determination on faces HOWLING down
the highway in a tractor-trailer cab no load to slow them

EXT RAPIDS - UPPER POTOMAC - NIGHT

Stevens and Trappe Fighting their way down rapids by night
just trying to stay upright in a boat never meant for this

EXT “HEART OF DARKNESS” — POTOMAC — NIGHT
They clear the rapids to reach slower water Here all
foliage is denuded the air heavy with dust and ash Soon
DRUUBEN ENGINES APPROACH forcing them under an arbor of dead
trees A SQUADRON OF PACHYDERMS appears heavy-lifters with
payload beneath Waiting them out Trappe notes
Crows in the trees framed against a full moon
TRAPPE
(hissing)
Still alive crows

STEVENS
I know

When the Pachyderms retreat Stevens and Trappe start
paddling again

Ahead the fires of Dc burn ever brighter

INT TRACTOR-TRAILER CAB — NIGHT
Coffey brakes hard at the top of a rise In the valley

beyond are two long lines of tail-lights There must be 100
cars here all stopped by

EXT DRUUBEN CHECK-POINT - HIGHWAY — NIGHT

A hovering gunship that blocks the road Droog soldiers are
checking drivers and vehicles

INT TRACTOR-TRAILER CAB — NIGHT

Coffey GRINDS into reverse Fast

RAAB
Wai’ wai’ wait May not be lookin’
for us -- could be one of their

travel check-points

She looks again Some motorists are outside cars
commiserating nervously Most wear barbed radio-bracelets --
civilian versions of the in-skin wire used on POWs

COFFEY
Well we still dont got time to get
stuck here Better find another —

RAAB
But what if he’s stuck here

Coffey shuts down the engine -- and picks up the fist-gun

EXT DRUUBEN CHECK-POINT - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

In an SUV near the front of the line we find a nervous
Worthy Will his POW wire get him through Or will it

get him killed He checks his mirrors considering turning
around and taking another route But now he spies
Coffey On foot Searching cars Fist-gun at low guard

Worthy slides down in his seat -- and slips a hand inside his
own fist-gun

CLOSE on the SUV’s side mirror Moving Tracking her
Inside Worthy raises his fist-gun anticipating Coffey on
his passenger side And just as she does enter viewjust
as Worthy squeezes the trigger-grip

The DRIVER’S WINDOW IMPLODES

Its Raab with a tire-iron He found him first

Worthy FIRES REFLEXIVELY in Raab’s direction

The Droog soldiers alert

With a KAMIKAZE CRY Coffey UNLOADS with her fist-gun

Half the SUV ROOF MELTS AWAY Worthy drops down and smashes
the accelerator with his hand

Running the check-point the SUV low-bridges the Droog
soldiers cartwheeling them over the top The SUV SMASHES
into the gunship glances off accelerates past

The gunship pivots weapons and OPENS FIRE on the fleeing SUV
But insanely that GUNSHIP TAKES FIRE from

Worthy’s airborne escort Like dragons doing battle the two
DRUUBEN GUNSHIPS BLAZE away at each other

Chaos Cars are peeling off to the sides SCREECHING away
Some people just bail out and run off into the dark everyone
fleeing the area

The check-point gunship is reduced to PHOSPHOROUS CHUNKS
We assume the airborne gunship won the battle until

It SLAMS down right in front of us a smoking molten mass
They killed each other

EXT THE ROAD AHEAD — NIGHT

As Worthy drives on alone

EXT DRUUBEN CHECK-POINT - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Everything is eerily quiet when Coffey rolls out from under
an abandoned car She’s the only thing alive here because
Raab is dead newest victim of Worthy On any other night
shed take the time to mourn him But tonight

Coffey grabs a new car and presses on

EXT KEY BRIDGE - POTOMAC RIVER - NIGHT

Rounding a river bend Stevens and Trappe see

The Francis Scott Key Bridge It’s partially collapsed
But on still-standing spans isa cordon of Droogs armed
silhouettes that stretch the breadth of the river Indians
on the ridge

Stevens signals “out” then rolls the skiff as they slip into
the water

INT OVERTURNED BOAT — POTOMAC -— CONTINUOUS

and reappear under the skiff In the air-pocket

TRAPPE
‘Sposed to be a no-go zone for them
and us How the hell do --

Stevens motions “Quiet” He knows

EXT UNDERWATER - POTOMAC - NIGHT

Just their feet Still kicking Still moving forward

EXT KEY BRIDGE - POTOMAC RIVER - NIGHT

The overturned skiff reaches the Key Bridge -- and drifts
right under To the Droogs above its just more flotsam

INT OVERTURNED BOAT - POTOMAC —- NIGHT

No words Only BREATHING Only the STRAIN of keeping the
skiff moving The water around them seems to light up now
taking on a fiery hue

They BUMP to a stop

EXT WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

The skiff has grounded on a shipwreck in the Potomac
Salamandering out of the water Stevens and Trappe climb
onto the hull And look

DC is blown away to its foundations our great monuments
toppled But alien architecture is rising in their stead
Pachyderms and other heavy-lifters ferry payloads to
construction platforms And the fires They aren’t from
burning buildings -- they’re from forges that burn in support
of this colossal construction campaign The Druuben are

erecting their capitol on the ruins of ours

TRAPPE
(overwhelmed)
This what I think it is
STEVENS
“Gomorrah”
TRAPPE
An’ all those peoplewith radiation
burns
STEVENS

Scarecrows To keep us out

TRAPPE
It’s likelike Istanbul building
on the ruins of Constantinople
after it was built on the foundations
of another city

STEVENS
It’s them pissing on our grave
That’s what it’s like

He pulls Trappe back to the boat

INT LIGHTHOUSE - CHESAPEAKE BAY — NIGHT

Wet boots trudge up a spiral staircase

EXT WIDOW’S WALK - LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The lighthouse stands at the confluence of the Potomac River
and Chesapeake Bay Taking up position in the widow’s walk
a lone man is revealed by the great Fresnel lamp that sweeps
behind him

He opens a tin and removes his last cigar The paper band
gets put on a finger for safekeeping A lighter strikes
The cigar is lit

ROMEO
C’mon Stevens

EXT LOWER POTOMAC -— POTOMAC - NIGHT
Stevens checks his Luminox “2400” Midnight

TRAPPE
How Long

The fires of DC are behind them Vegetation has reappeared
on the river banks The skiff is upright again moving under
the combined strength of Stevens and Trappe They make good
time but still

TRAPPE (CONT’D)
How long will your man wait

EXT WIDOW’S WALK - LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
Romeo nearly burns his lips on the cigar He waited until

the last possible second With regret that aches he tamps
out the butt

INT COFFEY’S CAR -— NIGHT
Were OVER COFFEY’S SHOULDER as she drives suicidally fast

seeing what she sees in headlights Dark winding road
Then a flash of a sign “Point Hope State Park” Soon

Qur headlights find the lighthouse

INT LIGHTHOUSE CHESAPEAKE BAY — NIGHT
Clutching the fist-gun Coffey whips open the door
COFFEY

(a quick probe)
Romeo

Ground floor of the lighthouse holds a nautical museum an
admiral’s dress uniform among the displayed items Coffey
reaches the big spiral staircase and looks up

COFFEY
ROMEO

Only her ECHO answers She closes the entrance door to check
the backside

COFFEY
(a punch in the gut)
Ten

There are 10 “Romeo Y Juliete” cigar bands stuck to the back
of the door Romeo has come and gone She rakes them away
in frustration swings the door back open but a cold 45
touches the rear of her skull GO DESPERATELY CLOSE on
Coffey “Is it Worthy

ROMEO (0S)
Drop the weapon

COFFEY
(flooding with relief)
Stevens sent me He’s still alive
and he sent me here to warn --

ROMEO (0S)
Drop the weapon or die

She complies It gets kicked clear

COFFEY
He sent me ahead to tell you warn
you about a guy named “Worthy”

ROMEO (0S)
What about ‘im

COFFEY
He may work for the Droogs sir
An’ he may be backtrackin’ you to
Boat 19 But hereif I can just
right in my side pocket got some
coordinates here that --

ROMEO (0S)
How you know Boat 19 Coffey

A heart-stopped beat

COFFEY
How you know my name

ROMEO (0S)
Because everything you just said
He said you’d say

She turns around Behind Romeo is Worthy

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - CHESAPEAKE BAY - NIGHT

VERY WIDE on the lighthouse We‘re eye-level with the

Fresnel lamp Its beam catches OUR LENS a few times --
before briefly catching and outlining a recon ship that
circles the lighthouse from afar

INT LIGHTHOUSE - CHESAPEAKE BAY - NIGHT

COFFEY
(to Romeo pleading)
It’s him it’s him it’s Worthy
Please you gotta trust me now The
Droogs put him in that camp just so’s
they could get to youjust to get
him hereright here right now

Romeo slides a look at

WORTHY
Who came in here carrying a Droog
weapon Her or me

COFFEY
Stevens gave it to me He gave it
to me so I could WHACK HIS ASS WHEN
I FOUND HIM

WORTHY
Just tell us why Coffey

COFFEY
Why what

WORTHY
Why you’d would give up like that
Why you’d sell out

COFFEY
Oh don’t you even start with that --

He shoves her hard and before she can recover Worthy
slings her into a display case

WORTHY
C’mon let’s hear the rational
Coffey And make it good huh

He‘s trying to work up enough righteous indignation to
justify killing her right now He snatches up a fallen
sword part of the admiral’s dress uniform

WORTHY
TELL US WHY

COFFEY
(to Romeo)
If you listen to him --

WORTHY
If you listen to her you’re playin’
right in their hands Now these are
the targeting coordinates as vetted
by Stevens himself

COFFEY
Herelookit mineI bet they’re
different than what he’s --

WORTHY

I bet they are -- since she already
changed ‘em Now these are the real
coordinates expressed in geodetic
longitude and latitude Stevens
himself told me to put this targeting
information in your hands and your
hands alone So take them Take
them back

Romeo deliberates Who to believe Who to kill

ROMEO
Yknow maybe Stevens should settle
this

WORTHY

Oh Id love him to -- but what if
he didn’t make it What if he never
shows Sir every minute you delay
is another minute they can track us
to this very

Romeo pitches his 45 across the room Hearing it CAUGHT
Worthy has an oh-fuck moment before turning

STEVENS
(closing in)
RY -- theyve got your family
BY -- they’ve got your crew the
one you said you had to bail out on
“Cc” -- well you tell us why Worthy

Surrounded Worthy clams up Coffey loosens him up with a
vicious right-cross

COFFEY
“And make it good huh”

WORTHY
Y‘know what There‘s a lot more
guys like me out there than you
think guys smart enough to know we
ain‘t goin’ back to the way it was
Hey you wanna die for some country
that no longer exists Fine you do

definition of loyalty not mine
All you people think -

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - CHESAPEAKE BAY - NIGHT

GUNSHOT Muzzle-flash in windows

INT LIGHTHOUSE - CHESAPEAKE BAY - NIGHT

STEVENS
“C —— you were just a dick

He squats to search Worthy’s body Trappe appears in the
doorway drawn by the gunshot Stevens finds Worthy’s hidden
arm-wire

STEVENS
(to Trappe)
Take his clothes take his car -- and

then take this damn thing far away
from here as you can Should draw
off that recon ship circlin’ the area
and buy us enough timeto

Faintly A SHORT-WAVE RADIO HISSES to life and dies Just
some anomaly Stevens looks down at

The wire heating up in his hand

COFFEY
Get rid of it

STEVENS
Move out Everybody

COFFEY
You know what that means Just get
rid of the damn thing ‘fore --
STEVENS
(with bedrock)
I said “go”

He knows what it means

INT LIGHTHOUSE - CHESAPEAKE BAY — 60 SECONDS LATER
The DOOR GROANS open

Two Droog boots cross the bloody floor of the lighthouse
They find no humans on this level Not even Worthy

DRUUBEN POV Orienting upward Catching a data-stream at
the top of the spiral staircase

The boots take the stairs three at a time And they bend the
iron steps

EXT WIDOWS WALKLAMP ROOM -— LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

The great Fresnel light sweeps inside in the lamp room
On the walkway that encircles the lamp room the Commandant

appears suddenly in a sweep of light

COMMANDANT’S POV Of the data-stream stronger now It
emanates from a pair of legs -- Worthy’s body -- lying on the
walkway 20 feet ahead

Now reveal Stevens Hunkered down on the other side of the
lamp house 45 gripped in hand Eyes trained on

A small mirror cocked just so In it he sees the reflection
of the Commandant

COMMANDANT’S POV OF MIRROR No reflections in DRUUBEN POV
He can‘t see Stevens

Stevens waits for the big Droog to enter his kill-zone
Each sweep of the light gives a new snapshot of the
Commandant approaching But now he stops Hackles bristle
Does he smell an ambush Or is he alerting to something
else

COMMANDANT’S POV Of a car leaving the area

INT COFFEY‘S CAR - NIGHT

Coffey Speeding away

EXT WIDOW’S WALKLAMP ROOM - LIGHTHOUSE NIGHT

COMMANDANT’S POV Of the shoreline Two figures running

EXT WHARF — CHESAPEAKE BAY - NIGHT

Romeo and Trappe are charging down a wharf Diving into dark
water Swimming to reach

An SPWS (Surface Planing Wet Submersible”) Rising
dramatically from the water is a next-generation Special Op

delivery craft It’s a speedboat that can operate above
water or below FOUR NAVY SEALS in wet-gear man the craft

EXT WIDOWS WALKLAMP HOUSE - LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

Stevens realizes he can’t wait any longer He corkscrews up
and FIRES SIX TIMES IN TWO SECONDS at

Nothing The Commandant moved away between light-sweeps

Speed over caution Stevens pushes through the lamp—-house
door

INT LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

and sees the reaching the base of the spiral stairs
Stevens SPENDS FOUR MORE ROUNDS before clicking dry

The big Droog TAKES TWO to the shoulders -- and his only
reaction is to pause and look up Right now it would take
the Commandant 10 seconds to climb the stairs and finish
Stevens off

But he doesn’t He bulls outside

STEVENS
Hey HEY

EXT WHARF - CHESAPEAKE BAY - NIGHT

Romeo and Trappe pull on masks and air-tanks The SEALS
fire up a NEAR-SILENT INBOARD MOTOR on the SPWS -- and get
moving

EXT LIGHTHOUSETOP OF CLIFFS - NIGHT
The Commandant Pounding toward low cliffs Bleeding from

shoulder wounds but not seeming to notice SEETHING with a
predatory excitement as he scans the waters in front of him

EXT SPWS - OCEAN - NIGHT

Graining speed Romeo and his team bite down on regulators
The pilot throws levers The SPWS starts free-flooding

EXT LIGHTHOUSETOP OF CLIFFS - NIGHT

underwater And getting his fix

EXT SPWS —- UNDERWATER -— NIGHT

As the SEAL pilot switches to battery power and keeps going

EXT TOP OF CLIFFS - NIGHT

Stopping at cliffs edge the Commandant extends his hackles
and holds them there uplinking to

EXT OVER THE OCEAN - NIGHT

The Druuben Hunter-Killer This is the “airborne contact”
we only glimpsed in the opening of the movie - the massive
thing that took out a carrier and its whole battlegroup

Ominously the Hunter-—Killer comes about

EXT TOP OF CLIFFS - NIGHT

The Commandant communes with the unseen Hunter-Killer
feeding it directions

STEVENS
OKO-OKO

Half of the Commandant’s hackles do a sudden about-face
reorienting on

Stevens He holds the admiral’s sword Brazenly

STEVENS
You heard me I said “Oko-Oko”

More hackles “look” at Stevens - through the Commandant
continues to face seaward torn by pride and duty But when
Stevens charges him

That war-scythe opens switchblade quick

Stevens dives drags his sword along the big Droog’s knee
tumbles clear Now he’s got the Commandant’s full attention

COMMANDANT
Voshak-Toshak

“It had to be”

The Commandant goes for a quick decapitation Stevens drops
rolls springs clear needing to draw this out as long as
possible -- needing to give Romeo time to escape He lands a
series of slashing blows to the Commandant’s lower body But
somehow he reminds us of a south-paw setting up his opponent
with a bunch of right-jabs Is something bigger coming

EXT SPWS - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The SPWS augurs through water Far away the OCEAN LIGHTS UP
eerily Again and again

EXT OVER THE OCEAN - NIGHT

The Hunter-Killer approaches fast From its belly studded
cubes are plunging into the ocean

EXT UNDERWATER -— NIGHT

---and detonating with PITCHFORK EXPLOSIONS a mile long
It’s overkill -- like fishing with dynamite - but overkill
is a Druuben specialty

EXT TOP OF CLIFFS - NIGHT

Stevens attacks again But this time he feints low —- and
swings the sword high

100 hackles hit the ground dancing there

Now reveal the Commandant - with a brand-new haircut
Stevens did to him what the Commandant once did to his own
guards

COMMANDANT’S POV Blurry Hazy Seeing Stevens only as a
ghost in a ghost world

The Commandant goes on a reckless offensive sweeping his
war-scythe like a punch-drunk fighter now just trying to
land anything on Stevens

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT

MORE PITCHFORK EXPLOSIONS more intense Unsure of the exact
location of the sub the Druuben are carpet-bombing the whole
damn ocean The DETONATIONS spike ever closer to

The SPWS Romeo checks his watch compass speed -- and
signals for the SEAL pilot to CUT ENGINES Dead-reckoning
tells him the sub should be here Somewhere Now a new
EXPLOSION illuminates

Boat 19 Right below them

Romeo and his team abandon the SPWS They swim hard for the
dry-shelters on the deck of the sub

EXT TOP OF CLIFFS -— NIGHT
The sword swings again

And CONNECTS with something soft behind the big Droog’s leg
Finally it happens The Commandant’s knee touches ground

STEVENS
So hows it feel

The Commandant staggers back up If he spoke English
hed be saying “Fuckin lucky punch” The big Droog snatches
up his war-scythe -- and goes after Stevens with new fury

INT READY ROOM —- SUB 19

The escape trunk purges A hatch opens In a cascade of
