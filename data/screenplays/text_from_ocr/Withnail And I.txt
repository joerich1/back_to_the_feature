Withnail and I
Camden Town London 1969
The Flat

A few shafts of sunlight sneak through the curtains and illuminate a
sitting room There are empty bottles everywhere I who is smoking
a
joint gets up somewhat precariously and walks into a kitchen which is
full
of bottles and dirty washing up He lights the gas on the stove and
puts on

the kettle

I knocks on the door to Withnails bedroom

I
Im having a cup of tea do you want one

He waits for a response

I
Do you want a cup of tea Withnail
Withnail
No
I leaves the flat slamming the front door behind him
The Cafe

I is reading a paper at a table in the cafe The proprietor is
cooking

eggs in a frying pan full of grease She takes one out inserts it
between

two slices of bread and places it in front of an elderly woman who
inspects

it doubtfully and bites into the sandwhich Yolk runs out of the other
edge I turns his attention to his paper The story is about a
transexual the headline Love made up my mind I had to become a
woman

He looks around at the other customers

I mentally

Thirteen million Londoners have to cope with this and bake beans
and

allbran and rape and Im sitting in this bloody shack and I
cant
cope with Withnail I must be out of my mind I must go home at
once
and discuss his problems in depth

The Flat

I stumbles up the barely lit stairs looking unwell Withnail emerges
from
his room holding a bottle and glass and follows him

Withnail

I have some extremely distressing news
I

I dont want to hear it I dont want to hear anything Oh God
its a

nightmare out there I tell you
Withnail pouring some wine

Weve just run out of wine what are we going to do about it
I

I dont know I dont know I dont feel good Look My thumbs
have

gone weird Im in the middle of a fucking overdose My hearts
beating

like a fucked clock I feel dreadful I feel fucking dreadful
Withnail

So do I So does everyone Look at my tongue A grey yellow sock
sit

down for Christs sake whats the matter with you Eat some
sugar

I goes into the kitchen which is by now full of steam and turns off
the
kettle Withnail follows him around reading from a newspaper

Withnail

Listen to this Curse of the superman I took drugs to win
medals

said top athlete Geoff Woade
I

Wheres the coffee
Withnail reading from the paper

In a world exclusive interview 33 year old shot putter Geoff
Woade

who weight 317 pounds admitted taking massive doses of anabolic

steroids drugs banned in sport It used to get him bad tempered
and

act down said his wife He used to pick on me But now hes
stopped

his much better in our sex life and in our general life
I pours water from the kettle into a bowl and goes back into the
living
room Withnail follows him

Withnail

My God this huge thatched head with its earlobes and cannonball
is

now considered sane Geoff Woade is feeling better and is now

prepared to step back into society and start tossing his orb
about

Look at him Look at Geoff Woade His head must weight fifty
pounds on

its own

(Withnail stands infront of a mirror and brushes his long greasy hair
with

a comb I sits on the settee and starts drinking the coffee from the
bowl

using a spoon

Withnail

Imagine the size of his balls Imagine getting into a fight with
the

fucker
I

Please I dont feel good
Withnail

Thats what youd say but that wouldnt wash with Geoff No Hed
like

a bit of pleading Add spice to it In fact hed probably tell
you

what he was going to do before he did it Im going to pull you
head

off Oh no please dont pull my head off Im going to pull
your

head off because I dont like your head

he notives I drinking from the bowl

Withnail
Have you got soup Why didnt I get any soup
I
Coffee
Withnail
Why dont you use a cup like any other human being
I

Why dont you wash up occasionally like any other human being
Withnail

How dare you How dare you How dare you call me inhumane
I

I didnt call you inhumane you merely imagined it Calm down
Withnail
Right you fucker - Im going to do the washing up

He strides towards the kitchen I jumps over the arm of the settee
and
stops him

I
No no you cant Its impossible I swear it Ive looked into in
Listen to me listen to me There are things in there theres a
tea-bag growing You havent slept in sixty hours youre in no
state
to tackle it Wait till the morning well go in together
Withnail
This is the morning Stand aside
I
You dont understand I think there may be something alive
Withnail
What do you mean a rat
I
Its possible its possible
Withnail brandishing his comb
Then the fucker will rue the day

He rushes up the the sink

Withnail

Oh Christ Almighty Synous nicotine based Keep back keep back
The

entire sinks gone rotten I dont know whats in here

He picks up the kettle from the stove then throws it suddenly into
the
sink

I
I told you youve been bitten

Withnail

Burnt burnt the fucking kettles on fire

Theres something floating up
Withnail with a fork in his hand
Fork it
I
No no no I dont want to touch it
Withnail

You must you must The poop will boil through the glaze Well
never
be able to use the dinner service again

He rumages about in a drawer
Withnail
Here get it with the pliers
I
No no no no no no Give me the gloves
Withnail
Thats right put on the gloves Dont attempt anything without
the
gloves

I starts to move things about in the sink rather gingerly

Withnail

What is it What have you found
I

Matter
Withnail

Matter Wheres it coming from
I

Dont look Dont look Im dealing with it
Withnail

I think weve been in here too long I feel unusual I think we
should
go outside

The Park
(Withnail and I walk along a path in the park

Withnail
This is ridiculous look at me Im thirty in a month and Ive
gota
sole flapping off my shoe
I
Itll get better it has to
Withnail
Easy for you to say lovey Youve had an audition Why cant I
have an
audition Its ridiculous Ive been to drama school Im good
looking I tell you Ive a fuck sight more talent that half the
rubbish that gets of TV Why cant I get on TV

I

Well I dont know Itll happen
Withnail

Will it Thats what you say The only programme Im likely to
get on

is the fucking news I tell you I cant take much more of this
Im

going to crack
I
Im in the same boat
Withnail
Yeah yeah I feel as sick as a pike Im going to have to sit
down

They sit at a bench in the park

I
You know what we should do I say you know what we should do
Withnail
How should I possibly know what we should do What should we do
I
Get out of it for a while Get into the countryside Rejuvenate
Withnail

Rejuvenate Im in a park and Im practically dead What goods

the

countryside What time is it
I

Its eight
Withnail

Fours hours to opening time God help us Have we got any
embrocation
I

What for
Withnail

To rub on ourselves you fool Well cover ourselves in deep heat
and

get up against a radiator Keep ourselves alive until twelve

He spits

Withnail

Jesus look at that Apart from a raw potato thats the only
solid to

have passed my lips in the last sixty hours I must be ill

The Flat

I is writting in a notebook on the settee while Withnail wonders
round

wearing his overcoat and his underpants smearing himself with deep
heat

I mentally

Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day And for
once
Im inclined to believe Withnail is right we are indeed drifting into
the
arena of the unwell Making an enemy of our own future What we need
is
harmony Fresh air Stuff like that
Withnail

Wasnt much in the tube theres nothing left for you
I

Why dont you ask your father for some money If we had some
money we
could go away
Withnail inspecting a bottle for dregs

Why dont you ask your father How can it be so cold in here
Its
like Greenland in here Weve got to get some booze Its the only
solution
to this intense cold Somethings got to be done We cant go on like
this
Im a trained actor reduced to the status of a bum I mean look at us
Nothing that reasonable members of society demand as their rights No
fridges no televisions no phones Much more of this and Im going to
apply for meals on wheels
I

What happened to your cigar commercial
Withnail

Thats what I want to know what happened to my cigar commercial
What
happened to my agent Bastard must have died
I

September Bad patch
Withnail

Rubbish Havent seen Gylgod down the labour exchange Why
doesnt he
retire

He picks up a paper

Withnail
Look at this little bastard Boy lands plumb role for top Italian
director Of course his does Probably on a tenner a day and i
know
what for Two pound ten a tit and a fiver for his arse

He points accusingly at I

Withnail Have you been at the controls
I
What are you talking about
Withnail
The thermostats what have you done to them
I
I havent touched them
Withnail
Then why has my head gone numb I must have some booze I demand
to
have some booze

He lunges towards the mantlepiece where there is a bottle of lighter
fluid

I standing up
I wouldnt drink that if I were you

Withnail
Why not
I
Because I dont advise it Even the wankers on the site wouldnt
drink
that Thats worse than meths
Withnail

Nonsense this is a far superior drink to meths The wankers
dont
drink it because they cant afford it

He pours the contents of the bottle into his upturned mouth

Withnail
Ah Ah Have you got anymore

I shakes his head Withnail presses forwards and I backs off

Withnail

Liar whats in your toolbox
I

No we have nothing Sit down
Withnail

Liar youve got antifreeze
I

You bloody fool You should never mix your drinks Withnail
laughs

histerically collapses to the floor and emits unpleasant
vomitting

noises

The Street

They walk towards a rather rough looking pub The Old Mother
Blackcap

Withnail
All right this is the plan We get in there and get
wrecked
Then well eat a pork pie Then we drop a couple of soamser
fifties each means well miss out Monday but come up

smilling
Tuesday morning Whats that appalling smell
I
Perfume on my boots I had to scrub the with essence of
petunia
The Pub

Withnail moves somewhat precariously to the bar The pub is a
simple
affair with a few men sat round at tables drinking

Withnail

Two large gins two pints of cider Ice in the cider
I

If my father was loaded Id ask him for some money
Withnail

If your father was my father you wouldnt get it
Barman

There you are lads
Withnail
Chin chin
(Withnail chinks his glass against the other which I has not
picked
up yet and downs the gin in one I follows suit but gags
slightly

I

Ugh What about what-his-name
Withnail

What about him

I

Why dont you give him a call
Withnail

Withnail
You want me to call what-his-name and ask him about his

I

Next to the door to the gents is a rather large Irish man sat

his pint and his paper

Big Irish man
Ponce
I ignores him and goes into the gents

I to himself

I could hardly piss straight with fear he was a man with
£

an inch of brain whod taken a dislike to me What had I
to

offend him I dont consciously offend big men like this

this ones a decided imbalance of hormone in him Get any
masculine than that and youd have to live up a tree he
the grafitti I fuck arses Who fucks arses aloud Maybe
fucks arses to himself again Maybe hes written this in
moment of drunken sincerity Im in considerable danger in

I must get out of here at once
He walks back into the bar

Big Irish man
Perfumed ponce
(Withnail is still at the bar He has made considerable progress

his cider and is eating some snack

Withnail

Youll be pleased to hear Montes invited us for drinks
I

Balls to Monty were getting out
Withnail

Balls to Monty Ive just spent an hour flattering the

bugger

I
Theres a man over there doesnt like the perfume The big

one
Dont look dont look Were in danger weve got to get
out
Withnail
What are you talking about
I
Ive been called a ponce
(Withnail turns to address the room in general
Withnail

What fucker said that

The large Irish gentleman in the corner gets up and walks over to
them

Now he is upright we see he is very large indeed and does not look
friendly

Big Irish man

I called him a ponce And now Im calling you one Ponce
Withnail (smiling)

Would you like a drink
Big Irish man

Whats your name McFuck

As he says this he jerks the scarf from around Withnails neck

Withnail

Ive a heart condition Ive a heart condition If you hit me
its

murder
Big Irish man

Withnail

My wifes having a baby Listen I dont know what my f he
starts

to say friend but decides on a better course of action
acquaintance

did to upset you but its nothing to do with me I suggest you
both go

outside and discuss it sensibly in the street

They push past the man and rush to the door

Withnail
Ahhhh out of my way

The Bathroom
I is in the bath shaving

I

Speed is like a dozen transatlantic flights without ever getting
off

the plane Timechange You lose you gain Makes no difference so
long

as you keep taking the pills But sooner or later youve got to
get

out because its crashing then all at once the frozen hours melt
out

through the nervous system and seep out the pores
(Withnail enters with their lunch from the chippy

Withnail
The bastards Justice suck Its a miserable cheap cigar and the
bastards wont see me

I
Why are we having lunch in here

Withnail
ts dinner and Dannys here
I
Danny How did he get in
Withnail
let him in this morning He lost one of his clogs Hes come in
because of the perpetual cold I hope the buggers sales plummet
I
ve got your savaloy Here I dont want it
Withnail
Then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later

He scrunches up the paper that was holding his chips and puts it in
the

toilet
I
Dont vent spleen on me Im in the same boat
Withnail
Stop saying that Youre not in the same boat The only thing
youre

in that Ive been in is this fucking bath
I

Dannys here Head hunter to his friends Head hunter to
everybody He

doesnt have any friends The only people he converses with are
his

clients and occasionally the police The purveyor of rare herbs
and

prescribed chemicals is back Will we never be set free
The Flat

I comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel

I
Danny
Danny
Youre looking very beautiful man Have you been away St
Peter
preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that
Have you
got any food
I

Mmm As a matter of fact got a savaloy
Danny
How much is it
I
You can have it for nothing
Danny sniffs the sausage Withnail enters from the kitchen
gluing the
sole back on his shoe He is wearing a rather expensive looking

suit
Danny
I see youre wearing a suit
Withnail
Whats it got to do with you
Danny
No need to get uptight man I was merely making an observation I
happened to be looking for a suit for the coal man two weeks ago
For

reasons I cant really discuss with you the coal man had to go to

Jamaica Got busted coming back through Heathrow had the weight
under

his fez We wored out that it would be handycarma for him to get
hold

of a suit but hes a very low temperature spade the coal man
went

into court wearing a kaftan and a bell This doesnt go down at
all

well They can handle the kaftan but they cant handle the bell
So

theres this judge sitting there sitting in a cape like fucking
batman

with this really rather far out looking hat
Withnail

A wig
Danny

No man this was more like a long white hat So he looks at the

coalman and says whats all this This is a court man This
aint
fancy dress and the coal man looks at him and says ‘you think
you
look normal your honour Cunt give him two years

I laughs a little Withnail looks on unamuzed

Danny

Im afraid I cant offer you gentlemen anything
I

Thats alright Danny Wed decided to lay off for a bit
Danny

Thats what I thought Except for personal use I concur with you
asa

matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into business
Withnail Scoffing

Doing what
Danny

The toy industry

There is a stange looking contraption on the table involving a
bottle

Withnail
Thought you were in the bottle industry
Danny
No man thats a side line You can have that Instructions are
included Yeah My partners got a really good idea for making
dolls
His names Presuming Ed His sister give him the idea She got
a
doll on Christmas what pisses itself
Withnail
Really
Danny
Then youve got to change its draws for it Horrible really but
theyre like that the little girls So were going to make one
that
shits itself too
Withnail
Shits itself
Danny
Hes an expert Hes building the prototype now To I Whys he
behaving so uptightly
Withnail
Because a gang of cheroot vendors consider a hair cut beyond the
limit
of my abilities
Danny
I dont advise a hair cut man All hairdressers are in the
employment
of the government Hair are your aerials They pick up signals
from
the cosmos and transmit them directly into the brain This is the
reason bold-headed men are uptight

Withnail
What absolute twaddle
Danny
Has he just been busted
I
No
Danny
Then whys he wearing that old suit
Withnail

Old suit This suit was cut by Hawkes of Saville row Just
because
the best tailoring youve ever seen is above you fucking appendix
doesnt mean anything
Danny
Dont get uptight with me man Because if you do Ill have to
give you
a dose of medicine and if I spike you youll know youve been
spoken
to
Withnail
You wouldnt spike me youre too mean Besides theres nothing
invented I couldnt take
Danny
If I medicined you youd think a brain tumour was a birthday
present
Withnail
I could take double anything you could
Danny removing his sunglasses
Very very foolish words man

I

Hes right Withnail Look at him His mechanisms gone Hes had
more

drugs than youve had hot dinners
Withnail

Im not having this shag-sack insulting me Let him get his drugs
out

Danny gets a doll out of a bag

Danny
This doll is extremely dangerous It has voodoo qualities

(Withnail snorts Danny takes the head off the doll and extracts a
handful
of pills

Danny

Trade Phenodihydrochloride benzelex Street The embalmer
Withnail

Balls Ill swallow it and run a mile
Danny

Cool your boots man This pills valued at two quid
Withnail

Two quid Youre out of your mind
I

Thats sense Withnail
Withnail

You can stuff it up your arse for nothing and fuck off while
youre

doing it
Danny

No need to insult me man I was leaving anyway Have either of
you got

shoes

Montes house

A battered Jag pulls up outside Montes house and Withnail and I get

out
There is a rather flash looking open-topped Rolls parked outside The

sound
of a Schubert piano sonata comes from the house

Withnail
Montes car

(Withnail knocks on the door Monte a rather fat effeminate middle-
aged

gentleman opens the door He is holding a very large fluffy cat anda
watering can

Monty
Oh hello Come in

They enter and go into the lounge

Monty
Sit down do Would you like a drink

They sit together on a sette

Withnail
Sherry
Monty
To withnail Sherry To I Sherry
I
Sherry
Monty
Sherry
Monty moves to the sideboard and pours the drinks Withnail lights up
yet
another cigarette

Monty

Do you like vegetables Ive always been fond of root crops but I
only
started to grow last summer I happen to think the cauliflower more
beautiful than the rose
Withnail

Chin chin

He drinks the sherry

Monty

Do you grow
Withnail

Geraniums
Monty

Oh you little traitors I think the carrot infinitely more
fascinating

than the geranium The carrot has mystery Flowers are
essentially

tarts Prostitutes for the bees There is youll agree a certain
je ne

ses quoi oh so very special about a firm young carrot Excuse me
Do

help yourselves to another drink

(Withnail turns and reaches a bottle over from the sideboard He takes
a
long swig

I

Whats all this The mans mad
Withnail

Eccentric
I

Eccentric Hes insane Not only that hes a raving homosexual

There is a yowl from the cat Monte storms back into the room
preceded by
the cat

Monty

You beastly little parasite How dare you You little thug How
dare

you Ooohhhh Beastly ungrateful little swine

He deposits his considerable bulk on the other settee facing the
first
Withnail

Shall I get you a drink Monte
Monty

Yes Yes please dear boy You can prepare me a small rhesus
negative

Bloody Mary And you must tell me all the news I havent seen
you

since you finished your last film

I smiles wriley to himself Withnail downs the drink he has prepared
for
himself pours another and starts making the Bloody Mary for Monty

Withnail
Rather busy uncle TV and stuff My agents trying to edge me
towards
the Royal Shakespeare again
Monty
Oh splendid
Withnail
Hes just had an audition for rep
Monty
Oh splendid So youre a thespian too

(Withnail delivers Montes drink and sits beside him

Withnail
Monte used to act
Monty
Id hardly say that Its true I crept the boards in my youth but
I
never had it in my blood and thats what so essential isnt it
Theatrical zeal in the veins Alas I have little more that
vintage
wine and memories

He stands and looks at a photograph on the mantlepiece

Monty
It is the most shattering experience of a young mans life when
he
awakes and quite reasonable says to himself He puts his hand on
his
heart I will never play The Dane When that moment comes ones
ambition ceases Dont you agree
Withnail
A part I intend to play Uncle
Monty

And youll be marvelous He starts quoting from Hamlet We do it
wrong being so majestical To offer it the show of
violence
As Monte rambles in the background I steps over to Withnail and
whispers

I
Hes a madman Any moment now hes going to rush out and get into
his
tights
Withnail
Ok ok Give me a minute
I

The house or out
(Withnail stands and moves over to Monte

Withnail
Could I have a word with you Monte
Monty
Oh forgive me dear boy forgive me I was allowing memories to
have
the better of me
Withnail
Shall I get you a top up He moves to the sideboard again Monte
sits
down and reminisces
Monty
Indeed I remember my first agent Raymond Duck Dreadful little
Israelite Four floors up at the charring cross and never a job
at the
top of them Im told youre a writer too Do you write poems
I
No I wish I could Its just thoughts really
Monty
Have you published
I
No no
Monty
Where did you school
Withnail
He went to the other place Monte
Monty
Oh you went to Eton
The cat reappears on Is chair

Monty

Get that damned little swine out of here Its trying to get
itself in

with you Its trying for even more advantage Its obsessed with
its

gut - its like a rugby ball now It will die it will die

He storms around ineffectually
Withnail
Monte Monte
Monty
No dear boy you must leave you must leave Once again that oaf

has

destroyed my day
Withnail

Listen Monte Can I just have a quick word in private
Monty

Oh very well
Later they are leaving the house Monty shows them to the door

Monty

Good night my dears
Withnail

Good night Monty

Monty closes the inner door to the porch behind them

I

Whats all this going off in private business Why did you tell
him I

went to Eton
Withnail

Because it wouldnt have helped if I hadnt
I

What do you mean by that
Withnail Showing him the key to the cottage

Free to those that can afford it Very expensive to those that
cant

The car

They leave Camden in Is battered old Jag Withnail still in
his

suit has a bottle and is clearly drunk They pass some
schoolgirls

Withnail

Scrubbers
Scrubber

Up yours grandad
Withnail

Scrubbers scrubbers
I

Shut up
Withnail

Little tarts they love it
I
Listen Im trying to drive this thing as quietly as
possible If

you dont shut up well get stopped by the police
The pass a notice anouncing an accident blackspot

Withnail

Look at that look at that Accident black spot These
arent
accidents Theyre throwing themselves into the road gladly
Throwing themselves into the road to escape all this
hideousness

To a pedestrian Throw yourselves into the road darling

you
havent got a chance
Somewhat later they join the motorway

Withnail
At some point or another I want to stop and get hold of a
child
I
What do you want a child for
Withnail
To tutor it in the ways of righteousness and procure some
uncontaminated urine
He takes out the bottle and instructions provided by Danny

Withnail
This is a device enabling the drunken driver to operate in
absolute safety You fill this with piss take this pipe

down the

trouser and sellotape this valve to the end of the old chap
Then

you get horrible drunk and they cant fucking touch you

According to these instructions you refuse everything
except a

urine sample You undo your valve give them a dose of

unadulterated childs piss and they have to give you your
keys

back Dannys a genius Im going to have a doze

They drive on Later with the light fading they leave the

motorway It becomes clear that the car has only one
functioning

headlight Still later it is totally dark and raining
heavily I

stops and attempts to transfer the single wiper from
Withnails

side of the car to his own but it refuses to come off He
gets

back in the car and in shutting the door wakes Withnail who

looks considerably the worse for wear

Withnail
Are we there

I
No were not were here and were in the middle of a
fucking
gale Now youll have to keep a look out your side If you
see
anything tell me Get hold of that map
Withnail
Wheres the whisky
I
What for
Withnail
Ive got a bastard behind the eyes I cant take aspirins
without
a drink Wheres the aspirin
I
Probably in the bathroom
Withnail
You mean weve come out here in the middle of fucking
nowhere
without aspirins
I
Where are we
Withnail
How should i know where we are I feel like a pig shat in my
head
I
Now get hold of that map and look for a place called Crow
Crag
The cottage
They draw up in a yard and get out of the car Withnail staggers
around aimlessly as I gets the baggage from the boot
Withnail
There must and shall be aspirins
I
Give me the key and get out of the way
Withnail
If I dont get aspirin I shall die here on this fucking
mountainside
They enter the house I lights a match and finds a lantern which
he
lights As the light comes up the inside of the cottage becomes

visible It is rather spartan

Withnail
Christ almighty
I looks round a little more thouroughly He notices a picture of
Monty on the wall

I
Monty
He looks accross to Withnail who is sat dejectedly in a chair

I
What are you doing
Withnail
Sitting down to enjoy my holiday
I
Right now were going to have to approach this
scientifically
First thing weve got to do is get this fire alight then we
split into two fact finding groups Ill deal with the water

and
the plumbings you check the fuel and wood situation
A little later Withnail re-enters the cottage from a rather wet
and
windy night He is holding a small stick
I
Whats that
Withnail
The fuel and wood situation Theres nothing out there
except a
hurricane This place is uninhabitable
They sit close to the fire which is rather small
I
Give it a chance Its got to warm up
Withnail
Warm up We may as well sit round a cigarette This is
ridiculous Well be found dead in here next spring
He attemps half-heartedly to light a cigarette
Withnail
Ive got a blinding fucking headache Got to have heat
He stands and smashes a chair against the floor A little later
the
fire is burning considerably higher
Withnail
Problems weve got to keep this bastard burning
I
Well weve got enough furniture for tonight Tomorrow we get
down

that farm and get some logs
Withnail
This is a mistake I tell you This is a dreadful mistake
Is bedroom

I wakes the next morning and gets out of bed He checks on
Withnail

who is still asleep He steps outside and walks accross the yard
to

examine the view It is quite magnificent Later he is dressed
and

walks down to the farm The building is surrounded by an
assortment of

farmyard junk He knocks at the door

Old woman
Whos there
I
Me
The door opens cautiously and an old woman peers out
inquiringly

Old woman
What do you want

I
Im a friend of Montague Withnail Hes lent us his cottage
I
wondered if you could sell us some food Eggs and things
She looks blankly at him
I
What about wood and coal
Again he elicits no responce Seeing she is wearing a hearing
aid
he bends down and talks directly to it
I
Im not from London you know
Old woman
I dont care where you come from
She slams the door I walks away
I
to himself Not the attitude Id been given to expect from
the H

E Bates novel Id read I thought theyd all be out the back
drinking cider discussing butter Clearly a myth Evidently
country people and no more receptive to strangers than city
dwellers

He walks back to the house and addresses the door

I
Do you think you could tell me where I could buy some coal
and
wood
Old woman
Youll have to see my son He runs this farm
I
Where is you son
Old woman
Up in top field You cant miss him his legs bound in

polythyne

The cottage

I walks back into the yard outside the cottage slips and falls

in

I

He bangs on the ceiling and moves to the sink to wash
I

(Withnail enters dressed already and wrapped in a blanket
Withnail

absolutely

being
on stage
He stands up and takes a foil from its bracket on the wall and
strides up and down in actorly fashion

I
Then they must be delighted with your career
Withnail
What do you mean
I
You rarely are
Withnail points the sword menacingly although there is a cork
on the

end
Withnail
You just wait Just you wait When I strike they wont know
what
hit them
He hears a noise from outside
Withnail

Tractor approaching
He goes to the window and knocks his head on the lantern hanging
from
the ceiling

I
Then get after it Thats the man
They rush out of the cottage and pursue the tractor

Withnail
Hey stop
I

The tractor driver notices them and stops

Withnail

They run up to the side of the tractor and address the driver

to the

fire

I
You want to get out the back dont you Get some spuds up
Withnail
Sorry I cant My boots are in the oven
I

Withnail
Gladly
(Withnail emerges from the back door with polythene bags tied
around
his feet He walks into the garden and after a little unearths a
potato

Withnail
Ive got one

Later the potatoes are peeled and ready to be cooked I sits
reading

Journeys end while Withnail dozes in front of the fire I
hears the

tractor once again and goes out to meet Parkin He is there with
some
logs

I
Great How much do we own you
Parkin

I

Withnail

Later I is washing his hands in the sink having finished getting the
chickens guts out Withnail enters with a shotgun and points it at Is
head

I
Never point guns at people Extremely dangerous Now what about
this
roasting dish What are we going to cook it in
Withnail
Youre the food and plummings man Ive no idea I wish Id found

down

He pokes the chicken with the gun It still has a few feathers

Withnail

Shouldnt it be more bald than that
I

No it shouldnt Right were going to have to reverse the roles
We

can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this bastard over the
fire

He tries to push the chicken into a kettle but it is too large to
fit

Withnail
Lets get its feet off
I
No its going to need its feet

He removes the chicken and takes it to the fire Opening the oven he
removes Withnails steaming boots and points the the brick in the
oven

I
Straddle them either side of that

He sits the chicken on the brick

A phonebox
I is smoking stood outside the phonebox waiting for Withnail

Withnail
Ive already put two shilling pieces in No I havnt got
another
Its not my fault if the system doesnt work
He emerges from the phonebox
Withnail
Bitch hung up on me
I fishes around in his pocket and finds a shilling for Withnail who
goes
back into the phonebox and dials

Withnail
Hello How are you Very well What Why wouldnt they see

months

He takes out his frustration on the phone hitting it for a while
then
leaves the phonebox

Withnail
Bastard asked me to understudy Constantine in The Seagull
Im
not going to understudy anyone especially that little pimp
Anyway I loath those Russian plays Always full of women
starring out of windows whinning about ducks going to
Moscow

Returning from Penryth they walk accross a field I is carrying some
shopping

Withnail
What do you think to Desmond Wolf
I
With respect to what
Withnail
Im thinking of changing my name
I
Too like Donald Woolfe
He hands the bag to Withnail and opens a gate It is clearly marked
Shut
this gate

I
Here changeover point
Withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesnt fasten They see
Parkin
on his tractor

Withnail
Do you think hes happier than us
I
No
Withnail
I suppose happiness is relative I never thought it would be
a
polythene bag without the hole in it
Parkin turns the tractor towards them stops and runs towards them

I
Whats up with him
Parkin
Shut that gate shut that bull
I
You didnt shut the gate
Parkin
Shut that gate shut that bull
A bull appears and pushes the gate open Withnail thrusts the bag
into Is
hands and vaults the wall I is left facing the bull in a narrow
corridor
between two walls

Withnail
Grab its ring Keep your bag up Outvive him
Parkin
Hey listen show no fear Just run at it
I
Well that cant be sensible can it The bastards about to

Withnail
Wants to get down there and have sex with those cows
I
Shut up Withnail
Parkin
Just run at it shouting
Withnail
Do as he says start shouting It wont gore you
I

A coward you are Withnail An expert on bulls you are not
He shouts and throws the shopping in the air The bull roars I
shouts
again and runs at it It turns and retreats to its field

Parkin

Shut that gate and keep it shut
Withnail

I think an evening at the Crow

The fields
It is dark The silloutes of Withnail and I appear on the skyline
I narrating

If the Crow and Crown had ever had life it was dead now It
was

like walking into a lung A self-sustained nicotin-yellow
and

fly-blown lung Its landlord was a retired alcoholic with

military pretentions and a complection like the inside of a

teapot By the time the doors opened he was arseholed on rum
and

got progresively more arseholed until he could take no more
and

fell over at about twelve o clock

The Crow and Crown
(Withnail and I are stood at the bar

Withnail
Well have another pair of large scotches
Raymond the publican gets the drink and takes the money for them
In

opening the till he just avoids falling over Withnail and I suppress
laughter

Raymond

Raymond

I

The door clatters open and a man in a thick coat walks in leans over
the

bar and helps himself to a beer I nudges Withnail The man takes an
eel

from his trousers which wriggles around violently He strikes its head
on

the bar and returns it to his trousers

I

So that we can eat it Were fed up with stew
They approach the bar

Withnail
Excuse me could we have an eel Youve got eels down your

post
but misses and staggers a bit He points meaningfully at the
various customers as he leaves shutting his coat in the
door

The cottage Withnail and I are sat inside There is no sign
Monte I has just finished shaving and is rubbing his face
with a
towel
I
Where is he
Withnail
Sulking up the hill He says he wont come down for lunch

a
glass
Withnail

trap
Hes so mauve we dont know what hell do next I walks out
in
distgust as Monte sips the sherry
the kitchen I is at the sink peeling potatoes Monte
enters
Monty
Im preparing myself to forgive you I think youve been
punished
enough I think we better release you from the legume and
transfer you talents to the meat he takes him by the hand
into
the lounge
Monty
You shouldnt treat each other so badly Hes been working
his
fingers to the bone and all you do is sit in here drinking
Now
hes going to revitalize himself in here while you finish
the
vegtables
Withnail

I dont know how to do them
Monty
Well of course you dont Youre incapable of indulging in
anything but pleasure am I not right I merely smiles
Monty
You dont deserve such loyalty Now come along Im going to
teach you how to peel a potato He rolls up Withnails

sleeves

and takes him unwillingly into the kitchen Withnail swipes
a

glass of sherry off the table on the way there

the dinner table All three are sat around the table eating
a

good looking roast dinner There is plenty of extra meat and
a

good supply of wine
Monty
Its very stimulating getting back to a basic sort of

lifestyle

Without effecened emotion and poisonous inhibition
I
Except the problem do tend to take the edge off it
Monty
What do you mean
I
There are no proper facilities
Monty
All the glorious trials of youth dear boy When I was a lad

rocket off on my tandem with Wrigglesworth and ride and
Find some old barn and fall asleep with the sweet perfume of

on our lips
Withnail
Would it be in poor form to plagarise a toast
Monty
It depend entirely on the quality of the wine In this case

most certainly would not
Withnail
In that case to a delightful weekend in the country
Monty
Oooh we were expecting a volley of argument concerning Mr
Redgrave I gives Withnail a look of daggers
I
Youre forgetting Jake
Monty
Jake can wait too
I
Jakes not a friend Monte Id hoped to avoid telling you

this
but theres a madman on the loose outside
Monty
Is this true
Withnail
Well theres this local type Poacher We got into a bit of
a
tiff and he threatened me with a dead fish Yes it was
rather
amusing acutally When you came into the house we thought it
was

him and we thought that you cleaning your boots was him
sharpening the knife

Monty
Oh how delicious

Im going for a walk

Oh wait for us dear boy well all go

Outside the cottage I is leaning on the wall Withnail
emerges
and walks briskly over to him
Withnail
Look I know what your thinking but I had no alternative

The old
beggers come a long way and I didnt want to put the wind up
him
I
You sensitivity overwhelms me If you think youre having a
weekends indulgence up here at his expense which means him

another thing coming
Withnail
Anyway he sent me out to say the coffees ready

back
such memories of Oxford I voice over followed by yet
another
anecdote about his sensitive crimes in a punt with a chap
called
Norman who had ref hair and a poetry book stained with the
butter
drips from crumpets
Monty
Indeed I often wonder where Norman is now Probably
wintering
with his mother in Guilford a cat rain vim under the sink
and

decay
Withnail
Legium pro Britania
Monty

Withnail
Sorry about that got a bit carried away Sort of said it

I

room
again its murder and youll be held resposible in law
The cottage Withnail is eating lunch at the table I is
reading
a note
I
Perhaps it is just that the evesdropper should leave as his
trade dictates in secrecy and in the dead of night I do
sincerely hope that you will find the happiness that has
saddly
always been denied me Yours faithfully Montegue H
Withnail

Poor old bastard
Withnail
Now I must say that represents a level of hippocrasy in you

that
Id previously suspected but not noticed due to highly
evasive
skills
I
Youll suffer for this Withnail What you have done will
have to
be paid for
Withnail
Ill say one thing for Monte he keeps a sensational cellar
There is a knock at the door
I
Who is it VOICE Telegram I gets the telegram and opens
it He
shows it to Withnail
Withnail
Well done
I
Well it doesnt mean to say Ive got the part They probably
just

want to see me again Well that settles it we leave
immediately
Withnail
What
I

Get you stuff together we leave in half an hour
Withnail

Dont be ridiculous I need at least an hour for lunch

The car Withnail is eating the lunch from a plate on his

knee
It is raining heavinly and Is side of the windscreen is
impossible to see through
Withnail
You got a truck coming up in this lane followed by a slow
right-hander
I
This is insanity
Withnail
Stay in this lane
I
What lane I cant see any lane
Withnail
Bear right bear right
I
I cant keep this up And I must get some sleep
The car It is daytime again and the rain has stoppedI is
asleep in the back on the car The car jerks around and he
woken
As he looks out the window the camera moves with his view
The
car is hurtling down the motorway swerving between the other
cars
I
Whats going on
Withnail
Im making time
I
Pull over you havent got a license
Withnail
No Im making time Here comes another fucker They swerve
infront of several more cars Then I sees a police van
behind
them
I
On no
Withnail
Its perfectly alright leave him to me
I
Youre full of scotch you silly tool The police van comes
along

side them and a policeman leans out pointing markedly to the
roadside Withnail pulls over the van draws up in front on

them
and the officers approach the car One knocks on the window
and
Withnail winds it down Pl Bit early in the morning for
festivities isnt it sir There is a large pile of bottles
on
the passenger seat of the car
Withnail
Theyre not mine they belong to him Pl Youre drunk
Withnail
I assure you Im not officer Ive only had a few ales Pl
Out
of the car Please Sir Withnail makes no move so he opens
the
door Withnail virtually falls out then stands against the
car
The policeman offers him a breathaliser Pl Would you fill
this
bag please sir Withnail shakes his head Pl Are you
refusing
to fill this bag
Withnail
I most certainly am Pl Im placing you under arrest
Withnail
Dont be ridiculous I havent done anything Listen my
cousins
a QC P2 Get in the back on the van
Police station Withnail is behind a screen A sergant is
sat at
a desk while other policemen wonder around P3 Serg whats
that
clown up to The sergent pulls a gap in the screen and sees
withnail with the contraption Danny gave him He grabs the
tube
and urine splashes everywhere Withnail grins sheepishly
The flat Withnail and I enter their flat They look through
the
post
Withnail
Wheres our checks
I

We didnt sign on
Withnail
That wouldnt make any difference to last weeks payments
They
hear music from upstairs The door to the bathroom is ajar
and in
the bath is a large black man who looks at them inquiringly

I
looks in his bedroom The bed is occupied by Danny
I
What are you doing in my bed D Having a sleep
I
Whos the huge spade in the bath D Presuming Ed
I
Well I want you out Youve got ten minutes alright Coz I
want
to get in
The lounge All four are sat in the lounge
Withnail
How did you get in D Inginuity man - come up the
drainpipe
Would you like a smoke
Withnail
Yes
I
No thanks Ive got a call to make Danny starts pulling
out
vrizzlers at a prolific rate
Withnail
What are you going to do with those D The joint I am about
to
roll requires a craftsman and can utalise up to twelve
spliffs

It is called a Camberwell carrot
I
Its imposible to use 12 papers on one joint D It is
impossible
to roll a camberwell carrot with anything less
Withnail
Who says its a Camberwell carrot D I do I invented it in
Camberwell and its shaped like a carrot Cut to Danny on
the
settee The Camberwell carrot is complete and is indeed of
prodidiuos proportions As Danny lights it we see only the
end
but as he hands it to withnail we see the true size It is
enormous D These will tend to make you very high
(Withnail
takes a long draw D This grass is the most powerfull in

the

western hemisphere It grows at exactly two thousand feet
above

sea-level I have it special flown in from my man in Mexico
His

names Huang Hes an expert I returns from his phone
call D
Did you get the part man I takes a draw on the joint and
splutters He shakes his head

I

No I got a different one They want me to play the lead
Withnail

Congratulations D Where exactly have you two been
I

London is

A trip to the countryside D That is a very good idea

a city coming down from its trip and theres going to be a

lot of
refugees Presuming Ed laughs deeply D Did you realise
this
gafs overrun with rodents When I came in I saw one in the
oven
the size of a fucking dog
I
That is a dog belongs to the man downstairs D Does his
dog get
in the oven
Withnail
No his dog doesnt come up here D Then it was a rodent
Quite
freeked me at the time I was going to cook onions There
was
some bald gieser round here the other day reckoned you owed
him
235 quid backrent I told him there was no question of
paying
rent on a property infested with rodent Started coming on
all
bald with me
Withnail
You mean ratty D I told him to piss off
I
You bloody fool Hell have us up in court again D No he
wont
its not legal
Withnail
We can quote you on that I presume D Law rather appeals to
me
actually Withnail laughs uncontrolably and drops to the
floor
D Just high
I
Stop laughing will you Withnail this is serious D No it
aint
I looked into it Studied the papers
I
What papers D Legal papers He shakes the papers out of a
bag
Look hes got our checks What are you doing with these D

I
was going to pay them in for you
I
For christd sake Withnail stop laughing will you Look
this is
a notice of eviction
Withnail
Give it to my barrister Presuming Ed starts chanting and
rotating a globe Ed Harriramma Hariramma
I
Shup up will you youre giving me the fear Give us a
downer
Danny Ive gone and fucked my brain D Sit down man take
control You have a rush It will pass
I
Arent you getting absurdly high D Precisely the reason
Im
smoking it
Withnail
I couldnt Im spaced D Not as spaced as you rodents
I
Dont talk about them D I expect theyre talking to each
other
I
Talking to each other What do you mean D Ive dealt with
them
Given em all drugged onion
I
Whyve you drugged their onions D Sit down man find your
neutral space You have done something to your brain You
have
made it high If I lay 10 mills of diazipan on you you will
do

trust one

something else to your brain you will make it low Why

drug rather than the other That politics aint it

I
Im going to eat some sugar D I recommend you smoke some
more
grass
I
No way no fucking way D That is an unfortunate political
decission
Withnail
What are you talking about Danny D If you are holding onto
a
rising balloon you are presented with a difficult political
decission - let go while youve still got the chance or hold
onto

We are

the rope and continue getting higher Thats politics man
at the end of an age The greatest decade in the history of
mankind is nearly over Theyre selling hippy wigs in

wolworths
It is 91 days to the end of the decade and as presuming ed
here
has so consistently pointed out we have failed to paint it
black
I
Right Im off now
Withnail
Already
I
My father will pick up my stuff in the week and do something
about the car
Withnail
But Ive got us a bottle open Confiscated it from Montes
supplies 53 Margaux Best of the century
I
I cant Withnail Ill miss the train
Withnail
Theres always time for a drink
I
I havent the time
Withnail
Alright Ill walk with you to the station We can drink it
through the park He grabs his coat and an umbrella and
takes
the bottle
The Park It is pouring down with rain Withnail offer the
bottle
to I
I
No thankyou no more Look its a stinker Withnail why
dont

Withnail
Because I want to walk you to the station
I
No really I really dont want you to They stop by the
wolves
I
I shall miss you Withnail
Withnail
Ill miss you too I departs Withnail walks to the fence
and
leans against it
Withnail

I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth

and
indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this
goodly
frame the earth seems to me a sterile promotory this most
excellent canopy the air look you this mighty orehanging
firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire
why it

appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent
congregation of
vapours What a piece of work is a man how noble in reason

how

infinite in faculties how like an angel in aprehension how
like

a God The beauty of the world paragon of animals and yet
to

me what is this quintessence of dusk Man delights not me
no

nor women neither nor women neither The wolves are
unimpressed Withnail exits into the rain
