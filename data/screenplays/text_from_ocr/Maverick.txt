As the SONG FINISHES --

-- CREDITS COME TO AN END

And the movie begins
FADE IN ON

EXT DESOLATE LANDSCAPE - HANGING TREE - DAY

Rocks Cactus The occasional tree

Not a place youd like to spend your summer vacation

Now there are sounds A WHIPPING WIND begins to get
LOUDER And in the distance but GROWING THUNDER

CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE --

SLOWLY INEXORABLY ACROSS this dead place --

-- suddenly it STOPS

We are in a Sergio Leone TIGHT CLOSEUP of just a hideous-
looking man One eye looks straight ahead The other
wanders

CAMERA MOVES AGAIN

The wind is really kicking up --

-- suddenly another STOP

Another Leone CLOSEUP

A second man This guy makes the first one look
handsome Both his eyes work which is an improvement
But his neck has been horribly burned as if from a noose
CAMERA IS MOVING AGAIN

LOUDER THUNDER A storm is coming fast

CAMERA STOPS

We are LOOKING AT the least appetizing of the three Not
that hes scarred not that all his parts arent in
proper working order -- its just that hes so damn
frightening

Not to mention huge

This is THE ANGEL and like the other two he is seated on
a horse And he is staring intently at something FROM
The Angel -- we go to

BRET MAVERICK

for this is who the trio is looking at

( )

MAVERICKs 30 give or take Enormously appealing
Whether thats because of his considerable physical
skills or his sunny personality who knows It might
be his quiet wit

In any case we are looking at a handsome young man that
everybody likes --

-- oops --
-- make that almost everybody

Because just now he is seated on a horse beneath a tree
and a thick hope has been tied around his neck the rope
thrown over a branch His hands have been tied behind
his back We are about to watch a hanging His

THE ANGEL

(riding closer)
I almost got hung myself once
didnt much care for it how about
you

(as Maverick

says nothing)
Were gonna leave now but Im
worried about your well-being

Maverick just stares at him makes no reply
THE ANGEL

He gestures for the other two to ride and they take
off

THE ANGEL
See I dont think its a good
thing for a man to be alone out
here Your mind can do cruel
things

And now he takes a burlap sack tosses it toward
Maverick It lands nearby

THE ANGEL
Enjoy the company

He spurs his horse rides away
MAVERICK

managing to turn his head in the direction The Angel
took

EXT SKY - DAY

EXT SKY - DAY

EXT HANGING TREE - DAY

Maverick staring at his horse The noise was loud

This time the horse doesnt move at all

Maverick sighs with relief glances around

headway

MAVERICK

his fight for life --

MAVERICK (VO)
It had been just a shitty week for
me from the beginning

Now FROM that --
FLASHBACK - EXT ROAD - LONG LENS - AFTERNOON 9A

A lone rider rides through dusty area up and down dips
in the road It is Maverick He rides a mule Angel

Maverick rides his mule along dusty trail as we PAN WITH
him a wagon train travels in opposite direction kids
play poker in the fg -- one smokes a corn cob pipe we
CONTINUE PAN WITH Maverick and REVEAL the town of Crystal
River a ferry coming across the river in the bg

MAVERICK (VO)

I was heading into Crystal River
to take some money from the bank
Probably I should have expected
bad luck on the horizon when my
horse got stolen and I had to
replace it with something less
than a thoroughbred

EXT CRYSTAL RIVER - AFTERNOON 10
Crystal River Not much of a place Dusty One main
street -- and almost every storefront indicates that it

is either a saloon or a gambling hall

Maverick riding into town from the other direction as
the dust whips up Hes wearing different clothes than

CUT TO
12 EXT CRYSTAL PALACE - AFTERNOON 12

The biggest establishment in town This place actually
has a second floor and advertises rooms as well as vices

13 INT CRYSTAL PALACE - STAIRCASE - AFTERNOON 13

Maverick is starting up the stairs when the REGISTRATION
CLERK hurries over from his desk

CLERK
You got a wire want me to read it
to you
MAVERICK
(reaching for it)
No
CLERK
(reading)
It just says ‘Watch your back

(beat)
No signature

(hands it over)
Here

Maverick takes it glances at it heads upstairs
13A EXT CRYSTAL RIVER - SUNSET 13A

The town and river look beautiful as the sun is going
down

INT CRYSTAL PALACE - DUSK 14
The place is busy enough the bar doing a brisk business

A poker game is in session Half a dozen play A
cattlehand a preacher a small-time local businessman
But its the other three we pay most attention to

First is a very young man Late teens looks less
Thin Small A hundred and thirty pounds after a big
meal This is THE KID Seems ordinary

Next to him sits of all things a woman But not
ordinary certainly not in these surroundings Shes
elegantly-dressed close to being beautiful Shes
married has a deep Southern accent and hasnt been
poor for a long time Maybe shes thirty She seems
a rotten poker player but a wonderful flirt This
is ANNABELLE BRANSFORD

Next to her sits The Angel We met him already -- he
tossed the burlap bag of rattlesnakes at Maverick just
before the hanging Huge powerful not much makes him
smile except winning at cards

There is an empty seat at the table
STAIRCASE

as Maverick descends If before he was grimy from
travel he isnt anymore He wears a black hat a black
jacket a black string tie --

-- and just the most beautiful white lace shirt you ever
saw

POKER GAME
as Maverick approaches

MAVERICK
(indicating the
empty chair)
Taken

ANNABELLE
(lilting Southern
accent)
It is now
(smiles at him)
My name is Annabelle Bransford
And what do people call you

MAVERICK
Bret Maverick mam

And as he starts to sit --
( )

14
THE ANGEL

glaring at Maverick (We know that within a week
hell hang Maverick But they havent met before)

THE ANGEL
I like the game the way it is

MAVERICK
I bring all kinds of plusses to
the table I hardly ever bluff and
I never ever cheat

THE ANGEL
I dont believe it

MAVERICK
Neither do I

THE ANGEL

(voice rising not
in pitch but
intensity)
I like the game just the way it
is
MAVERICK
Bet I can change your mind
(beat)
I promise to lose for at least
an hour
THE ANGEL
(without a pause)
Were playing five card draw
As Maverick sits --
MAVERICK
losing a hand to The Angel The Angel smiles --
-- but so does Maverick
MAVERICK
losing again this time to Annabelle Shes happy --
-- but again so is Maverick
And now we begin a SERIES of VERY QUICK CUTS
Of The kid holding his cards Tightly

( )

14A

14B 14
Of the cattleman casually making a bet Very casually

Of Maverick who doesnt seem to be paying much
attention

He loses again smiles

Now the preacher is staring at his cards before betting
For a long beat

And the cattleman is fiddling with his chips

The chips in front of The Angel are sloppy

The chips in front of Annabelle are neatly stacked She
flicks her fingernails against her front teeth makes a
bet

The businessman is toying with his necktie

The Angel is holding his cards moving the top to the
bottom then repeating the top to the bottom

And Maverick loses again smiles again just happy to
be there

Annabelle is suddenly helpless giggling staring at
what shes been dealt

The Angel is smiling happily He rakes in a pot
The businessmans fingers are tapping on the table
The Kids hand covers his mouth

The Angel is bored looking neither at the other players
or the pot

Annabelle bets big and wins -- maybe shes not such a
rotten poker player after all

Maverick tosses in his cards Another loss He smiles
glances at the clock on the wall -- an hour and a half

have gone by

EXT CRYSTAL RIVER - TWILIGHT 14A

It is getting dark Fewer people move about A lamp-
lighter is at work carriages pass with lanterns lit

INT CRYSTAL PALACE - TWILIGHT 14B

The table Maverick and the kid are the last two in the
game The kid turns his cards over

( )
14B

14B

Two pair aces over queens Maverick has three sixes
He looks at his winning hand almost in surprise Its a
good sized pot hes won As he reaches for it

THE KID
(mumbling something)
Dont think

The rest is unintelligible

MAVERICK
Didnt get you

THE KID
I said I dont think that hand
should count

MAVERICK
You got any logical reasons going
for you

THE KID

My mind wasnt on the game
His voice is always soft
CLOSEUP - THE KID

He stares at Maverick and something is suddenly clear
His eyes are deadly

MAVERICK
Hesitating now

MAVERICK
Whats your name son

THE KID
Johnny Hardin

MAVERICK
And what do you do for a living

THE KID
Oh mostly I kill people Ima
gunfighter

MAVERICK

Since youre still alive I have
to assume youre good at it

THE KID
Care to find out

( )
14B 14B
MAVERICK
(a beat -- then)
This hand definitely does not
count

(indicating chips)
Take whatever you thinks yours
Ill be content with the leavings

As The Kid does --

ANNABELLE

A quick look of disappointment crosses her face
THE ANGEL

A look of contempt crosses his

THE ANGEL
You always been gutless

MAVERICK

(thinks a minute --

then nods)
I think so At least for as long
as I can remember My pappy
always said He who fights and
runs away can run away another
day

(now he stands --

like every other

man in the room he

wears a six gun)
Heres the truth -- I dont see
whats so great about being brave

Pulls back his black jacket clearing his gun
KID

Watching His hand begins to move to his gun
ANNABELLE

This is not a nice place

TABLE

All watching Maverick now

( )

14B 14B
MAVERICK
(chatting idly away)
See youre a gunfighter and Im
not I like to play cards so the
fact is if Id faced you down
what chance would I have had
Answer Zero
MAVERICK

suddenly he draws -- and its lightning -- you never saw
anyone so fast

THE KID
Stunned
MAVERICK
His voice casual

MAVERICK
No chance whatsoever

And now he expertly twirls his gun back into its
holster

ANNABELLE
Leaning toward The Kid
ANNABELLE
Was that fast
(as The Kid manages
a nod)
I thought it was fast
MAVERICK

sitting back down at the table again This has all gone
quickly and quietly Now he looks at The Kid

MAVERICK
May I suggest that from now on
you keep your mind on the game

THE KID
Yes Yessir

MAVERICK
My deal

( ) 14B
THE ANGEL

Not remotely afraid of Maverick

THE ANGEL
You say you like to play cards
MAVERICK
Passionately
THE ANGEL
How come when you lose all the
time
MAVERICK

Oh I dont lose all the time --
just the first hour or so I like
for people to be happy

THE ANGEL
What happens after that

MAVERICK
Probably Ill win all your money

THE ANGEL
Arent you a little overconfident

MAVERICK
No Ive just been here before

POKER GAME BEGINNING AGAIN
And again we see a SERIES OF VERY QUICK CUTS

In fact we see many of the same cuts we saw before --
only this time Maverick doesnt lose he wins

The Kid holds his cards tightly Too tightly He makes
a bet Maverick doubles it The Kid folds He was
bluffing

The Cattleman casually makes a bet Very casually
Maverick doubles it Another bluff Maverick wins again

Annabelle is suddenly helpless giggling

Maverick folds The others bet Annabelle wins -- she
wasnt bluffing

The Angel is guarding his cards with both huge hands He
makes a big bet Maverick makes a bigger one The Angel
folds Angrily He was bluffing

( )
14B 14B
The Businessman is playing with his tie He bets
Maverick makes a big raise The Businessman calls They
both have good hands But Mavericks is better
The Angel is bored makes a bet looking at neither the
other players nor the pot Maverick makes a big bet The
Angel throws his cards down his anger building as he was
caught in another bluff
CLOCK
Time is passing
POKER GAME
Maverick has cleaned out everybody but The Angel

The Angel hesitates moving the top card to the bottom
does it again moves the top card to the bottom --

-- now he makes a bet

Now Maverick makes a bet A huge bet

THE ANGEL

scowling staring

MAVERICK

Nothing shows on his face He just waits Then --
THE ANGEL

He wants to bet but you can tell it in his eyes -- hes
scared hes not strong enough

MAVERICK

The others are watching Annabelle smiles at him He
politely touches the rim of his hat

THE ANGEL

he hurls his cards to the table Maverick wins
MAVERICK

putting his cards face down starting to collect the pot
THE ANGEL

suddenly reaching out grabbing Mavericks cards
turning them over --

( )

14B 14B
MAVERICKS CARDS
He has shit Not even a pair This time he was bluffing
THE ANGEL
on his feet with a roar --

THE ANGEL
You said you never bluffed

MAVERICK
(very calm
collecting the pot)
No I said I never cheated and I
dont I also said I hardly ever
bluffed This was one of the
hardlys

THE ANGEL
You cheated the whole goddam game

MAVERICK

What do you think I was doing
that first hour Learning your
‘tells thats all Once I could
read your hands once I could read
you --

(shrugs)
-- things just kind of worked out

THE ANGEL
I just called you a cheat

MAVERICK
You also called me gutless I
figured you were teasing --

THE ANGEL

blind mad He reaches his huge arms across starts to
grab Maverick

15 INT CRYSTAL PALACE - NIGHT 15

FOUR UNSHAVEN BIG MEN bursting through the front door of
the place the LEAD GUY has his gun drawn --

LEAD GUY
(to The Angel)

MAVERICK

and hes not so casual now His eyes flick around
looking for a place to move

FOUR UNSHAVEN BIG MEN

Three of them fanning out behind the Lead Guy blocking
anyplace Maverick might go

LEAD GUY
I spotted ya through the window
and it made me believe in The
Almighty

MAVERICK
You fellas were drinking you

your fault
(beat)

But its our time come now

swinging front doors --

FOUR GUYS

He turns now turns to face them

THE ANGEL AND OTHERS

watching as the Four Guys stare at Maverick wary ready
for anything

MAVERICK
MAVERICK

Three of them look to the Lead Guy He hesitates drops
his gun belt too

THE ANGEL

FOUR GUYS - THE LEAD GUY
cracks whip
LEAD GUY

MAVERICK

faster in a fight -- faster and fearless and as he wades

in --

ANNABELLE

watching Eyes bright
THE ANGEL

watching stunned at what hes seeing out there in the
night and --

MAVERICK

spinning throwing an elbow into the gut of the nearest
big man The blow connects perfectly and the Guy starts
to double over his knees weak and he falls

SECOND BIG MAN

swinging viciously and he knows how to use his fists --
-- but hes slow too slow

MAVERICK

ducking the blow coming up with a punch of his own that
lands on the side of the jaw and the guy staggers back
and down

THE KID

watching and probably hes never seen anything like this
one guy attacking four

THE ANGEL

and for just a moment now as he stares out almost in
disbelief theres something new behind his eyes Fear

MAVERICK

leaving his feet kicking out with both legs at the third
guy crunching him in the chest sending him careening
back cartwheeling to earth

LEAD GUY

diving at Maverick from behind and for a moment hes
got him his arms tight around Maverick

( )
MAVERICK - Rev 111593 19

MAVERICK

and the instant this happens he lets his body go totally
limp so the Lead Guy is left having to hold him up and
he hadnt expected this and as Maverick sags --

LEAD GUY

stunned as suddenly Maverick stiffens tosses the Lead
Guy over his head and through the air where he lands
hard

MAVERICK

moving back on the First Guy the one he creamed the air
out of and as he approaches the First Guy turns runs

LEAD GUY

on his feet running too

MAVERICK

watching as all four take off into the night Maverick
picks up his gun belt straps it on as he heads back
toward the frontier

INT CRYSTAL PALACE - MAVERICK - NIGHT

enters He seems remarkably calm considering what hes
just done Breathing heavily sure a little dusty
absolutely but no more

Annabelle hurries to him

ANNABELLE
That was the most amazing thing

MAVERICK
(shrugs)
Sometimes you get lucky is all
And as he walks forward --
MIRROR
as he passes
MAVERICK
a glance --

-- and then he stops dead --

( )

-- now he moves forward --

-- he touches his beautiful ruffled lace shirt --
-- no question about it its dirty from the fight
CLOSEUP - MAVERICK

A look of blind fury is there

THE ANGEL

watching as Maverick storms toward him

MAVERICK
All right -- my shirts damaged
what the hell else bad can
happen --
(pointing to The
Angel)
-- you were saying something

THE ANGEL
(pacifying)
-- Nothing nothing wasnt
important --

ANNABELLE
(thinking back)
-- Didnt you call him a gutless

coward -- Im pretty sure that
was it
THE ANGEL
(sweating)

-- never said such a thing --

gutless cheat yes but I would

never call a man a coward --
(hopefully)

-- and I was teasing

Maverick studies the bigger man for a moment Then
amiably --

MAVERICK
(as he sits)
Lets play poker

As Maverick turns --
JUST AN INCREDIBLE-LOOKING MAN
-- well find out soon enough his name is ZANE COOPER
He is raw-boned blue-eyed muscle and sinew rugged as
they come There is also something about him we dont
know yet but we will Coop is so good so fucking
honorable he seems like someone out of another era --
-- which in point of fact he is Coop is the western
hero who dominated movies for most of this century In

other words we are looking at John Wayne or Gary Cooper

ANNABELLE

At that moment Annabelle loses her footing on the trail
and lurches forward She grabs onto Maverick clutching
onto his gunbelt as she tries to keep her balance
Annabelle FIRES ONE ROUND into the ground (with his gun
still in his holster) Maverick turns and looks at her
in amazement

ANNABELLE

MAVERICK

MAVERICK - Rev 83193 52B 56

down to the earth listening

ANNABELLE
Oh right Lemme guess You smell

MAVERICK - Rev 83193 52c 56

over his eyes)

Thats all it is just dirt
MAVERICK

still watching it Then he rises whistles for his
horse gracefully mounts

And rides very slowly forward

If it isnt clear by now it should be Mavericks fol-
lowing something

Who knows Maybe he was an Indian Scout after all In
any case this much is clear the man has instincts

other people dont have

EXT TRACKING AREA 3 - WATERFALL - LATE AFTERNOON 58

Maverick riding along watching the terrain The sound
of a WATERFALL GETS LOUDER as he approaches it

-- he stops --
-- listens --

-- no question hes hearing something it is FAINT
MUSIC

He urges his horse forward very slowly

EXT WATERFALL AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

The terrain theyre going over Rocky again The
HORSES HOOVES make sounds Over the RUSH of the WATER-

Staring ahead Now --

EXT CAMPFIRE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON 60
Across a pond -- a campfire Half a dozen men They are

ANNABELLE

CLOSEUP - MAVERICK

MAVERICK
Not a thing Personally I think

I say its their fault for being
on our land before we got here

ALL THREE
Annabelle nods
MAVERICK

ANNABELLE
(rising along with
Coop)
This could be exciting

ANNABELLE
Couldnt be as dangerous as being
a married woman and standing next
to the most blindingly-attractive
man on the face of the earth

MAVERICK

His back has been to her but its clear to him shes
talking about him

He turns --
-- oops --

-- shes looking at Coop and thats who shes been talking
to

Maverick embarrassed turns away

MAVERICK

MAVERICK

I couldnt make you great if I
lived to be even as old as Coop

Shut up Shut up Shut up
EXT CAMPFIRE VICINITY - NIGHT 64

every one of your pretty little

heads
SIX GUYS
blinking Theyve all had too much to drink sure but
this is news you dont forget in a hurry Now they stare
at the area around them
MAVERICK
Going on calmly without a care in the world

MAVERICK

Now youve got a perfect right

to know whos out there and why
COOP AND ANNABELLE
crouched hidden watching Coop misses nothing

MAVERICK

pointing to the nearest of the six

MAVERICK
The man wholl blow your brains
out is Marshal Zane Cooper I
know what youre thinkin’ I

know hes old and decrepit and he
guns his food and his women But
he can still shoot straight

(to the next guy)
Johnny Hardins out for you You
probably know him unbeaten as a
gunfighter And hes not dead
but he hangs out with dead people

MAVERICK

(to third guy)
You belong to Ugly Annie Bransford
-- clocks have been known to beg
for mercy when Ugly Annie comes
near -- Shes so ugly her mother
had to hang pork chops around her
so the dog would play with her
Shes so ugly that when shes
making love she has to pretend
shes someone else

is steaming
COOP
(whispered)
Admit it that was funny

ANNABELLE
I didnt think it was funny

chatting amiably on

THE SIX

MAVERICK
Whistle come on what
another wheel off Okay clap

Why this fuss Cause some Indians
killed some whites attacking a wagon
train I believe that but some of
the women you know how hysterical
they can get think it might have
been whites masquerading Silliest
thing I ever heard of Besides no
fool of a woman could recognize a
man in war paint on horseback anyway
So all this is going to cost you is
a few hours of beauty sleep

scared worse than before scared of all kinds of things
now Hes getting them no question

MAVERICK

Convincing as hell

MAVERICK
The reason Im the one out here is
well some people think I can
talk pretty good -- not that Im
exactly helpless with a gun --

MAVERICK - Rev 111593 65 66
COOP WITH ANNABELLE

the SOUND OF GUNFIRE begins --

ANNABELLE
Arent you going out there

COOP
(aghast)
A man could get killed doing that

Now from them --
MAVERICK
-- only he isnt there --
-- because from here on until its over hes in constant
movement and weve known he could draw and weve known
he could play cards but we didnt know til now how quick
he was --
-- plus one more thing --
-- every time he FIRES he hits what hes aiming at --
-- and hes in mid-dive now as the BULLETS land where
he was and he comes out of the dive into a roll and
as he comes up out of the roll FIRING --
FOURTH GUY

forearm and he screams drops the gun scrambles after
it with his good hand and --
MAVERICK

risking one more shot and he squeezes it off goes into a
sideways roll as we --

THIRD GUY

the one who began the firing as Mavericks SHOT crushes
his shoulder and he screams too but the pain has him and
he drops his gun and falls and --

COOP

isnt over for him and --

FIRST AND SECOND GUYS

the ones with their hands on the tops of their heads
and by now theyve managed to drop to earth reach
around find their weapons and --

MAVERICK

diving again rolling up --

-- but this time he doesnt fire instead goes into a
second dive and we hadnt expected it and neither
did anybody else as --

FIRST AND SECOND GUYS

doing their best to shift their aim and --

MAVERICK

coming up to one knee concentrating on the first guy
and --

SECOND GUY

moving away and for just a moment hes got Maverick
dead in his sights and --

MAVERICK

BLASTING the first guy hitting him in the thigh and as
he starts to fold --

SECOND GUY
about to squeeze off a deadly shot when we --

MAVERICK - Rev 111593 67 66
ANNABELLE

terrified and then something amazing happens --

-- Coop draws And if Maverick is fast well Coop is
too and TWO SHOTS come almost at once and --

SECOND GUY

as the first shot from Coop takes the gun from his hand
the next SHOT crunches into his shoulder and he cries
out begins to spin to earth and --

COOP

the gun already back in its holster --

ANNABELLE

did she just see what she thought she saw Coop just
stares out as before as if nothing had taken place

MAVERICK

looking at the second guy -- watching him hit the
ground and for just a moment hes not quite sure what
happened but there isnt time to think as we --

FOURTH GUY

who was hit in the forearm and now hes got his gun in
the other hand and as he does his best to aim --

MAVERICK
FIRING another perfect SHOT --
-- ooops --
-- his GUN makes a CLICKING sound -- no more bullets --
MAVERICK
(cursing himself)

Learn to count asshole --

And as he drops his pistol reaches around for
Annabelles --

ANNABELLE

clearly the leader of his tribe and his teepee reflects
this Gorgeous skins as rugs gorgeous feather head-
dresses hanging from the walls

Joseph is helping Maverick test a brand new bipedal

duct of decades of inbreeding he is reminiscent of Peter

Ustinov in Quo Vadis when he played Nero

Majesty has had a happy day

EXT TRAIL — DAY

Maverick riding along a trail going the opposite direc-
tion as when he left

TURNING IN TRAIL
Rocks on either side As he takes it he sees a
RIDERLESS HORSE

The rider face down lies moaning in deep pain His
body is at a funny angle -- legs could be broken

MAVERICK
reining in dismounting

MAVERICK
Hang on

GUY ON GROUND

Groaning is louder

MAVERICK

kneeling gently turning the guy over
CLOSEUP - GUY

Hes the first person we saw in the movie the guy with
the wandering eye who witnessed the hanging

Has no idea who the guy is

WANDERING EYE

He whispers As Maverick bends close --

ANGEL AND GUY WITH BURNED FACE
appearing behind him and while he is unaware burned face
grabs his gun from its holster while Angel delivers a
vicious kick to the back of the head

MAVERICK

falling to the ground stunned in sudden pain He
starts to rise --

-- but too late --

-- Angel delivers another terrible kick -- this one flush
in the stomach Maverick gasps

ANGEL
Another kick into the stomach This one harder
Maverick is beginning to go pale Impossible to breathe
now

ANGEL

Should have paid your cowhands
more Maverick

(and now kicks

Maverick brutally

in the neck -- )
Lucky for you Im not the kind who
minds being made a fool of

As he gestures for others to join him in beating the hell
out of Maverick --

ANGEL

I never would have let you make

done what you done I might have

let you live

EXT HANGING TREE - DAY 84
The sky THUNDER

-- we are back at the shot that ended the opening
sequence --

-- Mavericks hanging
The rattlers are moving out of the burlap sack
They wriggle closer to Maverick on his horse
His horse is a rock

Maverick struggles to free himself harder than ever all
hes got and more and

The rattlers will not stop -- will -- not -- stop --
The horse sees the rattlers now --

-- and doesnt budge

Maverick in desperation increases his efforts
THUNDERCLAPS

Lightning

The rattlers start to curl

Totally without warning Mavericks horse bolts
Mavericks body drops into space

He hangs helpless in mid-air

The rattlers continue to curl

Maverick fights somehow to free his neck from the
noose --

-- trying somehow to find a way to survive
No good

Not enough breath

His bodys struggling becomes more feeble
Then more feeble still

He is a strong and powerful man but in the last hours he
has been in gunfights been beaten half to death --

-- his energy is going
Going
Almost gone now

( ) 84
His body hangs motionless in space
Nothing left
As his eyes start to close --
EXT HANGING TREE - DAY 85
-- the LOUDEST THUNDERCLAP of all Deafening --
-- and the whole goddam branch Maverick is hanging from
is ripped from the tree and as it falls hard to the

ground Maverick with it --

-- the rattlers are all around him Hes landed stunned
in their midst

Its impossible to tell which one of them will strike
first Now --

TWO GNARLED HANDS

Thats all we see at first just the hands One of them
grabs the burlap sack the other starts scooping up the
rattlers putting them back inside

No fear of consequences One-two-three-four-five-six
and the rattlers are gone from view And once they

are --

PULL BACK to reveal

the MAGICIAN for that we will learn is the name of the
woman we are looking at

Little old woman more precisely

Weird-looking little old woman more precisely still She
is dressed in clothing that neither fits nor matches

When she talks she talks very loudly Clearly she
doesnt get a lot of company Right now she isnt
talking at all just staring at Mavericks still body

Mounted on her strange little cart is the biggest buffalo
gun you ever saw It is what blasted the tree branch to
the ground And smoke still drifts out of the barrel and
hangs in the air

Now she takes a foot pushes Maverick over so hes on his
back

Next she aims the huge weapon at Mavericks heart

85
THE MAGICIAN

MAVERICK

Barely able to speak Still this latest piece of news

Thats exactly what you look like

MAVERICK
Youre wrong -- I play cards

THE MAGICIAN
(shakes her head)

but because he is far beyond exhaustion His body begins
to shake as if with fever HOLD ON Maverick Now --

would close my eyes and cut her
the ace of spades -- it was her
favorite card Whenever Id ask
her to think of a card she always
said ace of spades

THE MAGICIAN

Watching The snakes are moving around her chair She
gestures for them to stop -- instantly they go still

MAVERICK
Still in the reverie

MAVERICK
I closed my eyes and she shuffled
and I cut --
(beat)
-- but I failed Got a spade but
it was just the nine anyone can
do that

THE MAGICIAN
Ill get some cards This time
youll cut the ace for sure

MAVERICK
It wont work

THE MAGICIAN

Try

MAVERICK
Im not going to do it Im not
going to fail again -- get that

through your head
THE MAGICIAN

as suddenly she makes a sound we havent heard from
her before and --

RATTLERS
starting to go wild and --
MAVERICK
staring frozen --
MAVERICK
Maybe I will give it a shot after

The Magician makes another strange sound The snakes
calm own

( ) 88
THE MAGICIAN
Somehow I figured you might
change your mind
Now from that --

DECK OF CARDS

The Magician is finishing shuffling She plops them
down on the tree trunk makes a neat pile

PULL BACK to reveal

MAVERICK AND THE MAGICIAN

seated across from each other The snakes are all around
-- they seem fascinated all of them facing the tree
trunk

Maverick eyes the snakes -- they dont do much for his
peace of mind or his confidence -- but clearly he has

no confidence anyway

THE MAGICIAN

She places the wad of money next to the cards gestures
for Maverick to start He hesitates then --

MAVERICK

He starts breathing more deeply Its almost as if
hes trying to enter a different state He stares

up --
GIANT CLOUDS
moved by the wind
THE MAGICIAN
waiting
RATTLESNAKES
waiting
MAVERICK
Voice almost in a reverie
MAVERICK
I loved my mother a whole lot
she was everything you could

want --

THE MAGICIAN
You stalling

MAVERICK
I guess

THE MAGICIAN
Well quit it

CLOSEUP - MAVERICK
He puts his hands in his lap
Its as if hes trying to go into a deep trance now

Hes breathing deeply And now something strange the
wind turns into MUSIC A gorgeous theme It plays on

THE MAGICIAN

caught up in it watching The snakes seems caught

up in it too -- they arent watching the cards anymore
theyre turned to Maverick

MAVERICK

And now he closes his eyes His breathing grows very
deep The wind MUSIC is louder more beautiful

He drops his hands into his lap
His head lolls back -- and suddenly the music is gone --
-- his eyes open he shakes his head
MAVERICK
I was trying to go somewhere

in my mind Couldnt

THE MAGICIAN

I was watching -- you were getting
into a trance -- you were almost
there
MAVERICK
(dubious )

You just want it to happen thats
all -- nothing felt right

THE MAGICIAN
You give up too fast -- if magic
was easy everyone would do it
You want to win that poker thing
dont you

( )

CLOSEUP -

RATTLERS

They have 88

MAVERICK
I do

THE MAGICIAN
Well youre not gonna win nothing
without a spot deep inside that
tells you its okay A spot that
says Be a fool if you want just
be the best fool around and Ill
stay with you forever’

MAVERICK
I dont want to be a fool

THE MAGICIAN
You think when I was little and
playing with dolls I thought ‘I
cant wait to grow up so I can be
a hermit and have rattlesnakes for
friends

THE MAGICIAN

THE MAGICIAN

I was whipped and beaten and left to
die and I could have but that spot
talked to me it told me No
dont let the world piss on you
its okay to live alone rattlers
dont talk back and theyre more
honest than most people get a
move on

(beat)
Now Im a great hermit and I
wouldnt be nothing else

at Maverick

MAVERICK

been watching The Magician Now they look
MAVERICK
(soft)
I was whipped and beaten and left

to die

THE MAGICIAN
Point of my story

For a moment he doesnt move at all Then he sits

deeper in

the chair again closes his eyes breathes

deep deeper The wind MUSIC is back

( ) 88
His hands are limp in his lap The music is glorious
THE MAGICIAN

money shoves it at Maverick

THE MAGICIAN

reveals it into her face and she screams She clutches
it to her breast and then realizes its intimacy and
slaps him

ANNABELLE
How did you ever escape from
those hostiles
He doesnt answer

MAVERICK - Rev 111593 110

MAVERICK
Mrs Bransford I like to think I
enjoy a prank as much as the next

robbing me blind as I went off to
face death with the Indians

natural modesty makes me so

casually watching him
INT MAIN SALON - LAST HAND - DEALER - DAWN 145

Coop probably never had a
dishonest thought til this
happened And for the rest of
his days Hes going to be
haunted whatever we do And
thats punishment enough for a
man I wont swear out a warrant
against him

THE COMMODORE

(to the crowd --

unexpectedly moved)
Ill be damned Ill be damned
I know a little something about
money -- made a lot in my lifetime
gonna make a lot more But this
young man has more wisdom now about
whats really valuable than I11l
ever have I had two wives leave
me on account of my obsession with
making money

to Maverick)
Dont you ever change

imaginary glass --

toasting)

And on that --
MAVERICK

as he suddenly grabs her lovely blouse and rips it wide
open --

-- Annabelle shocked cries out opens her eyes her
hands trying to cover her suddenly revealed body --

-- but too late
Over her slip she is wearing the most Rube Goldberg-like

thing you ever saw (It was called the Kepplinger Hold-
out and was a series of pulleys and cords that hid a

remarkable number of cards The thing worked believe it

or not by using the knees and is generally thought of
as being the greatest card-cheating device of the past
century)

ANNABELLE
(embarrassed)
I didnt wear it til the
break --
MAVERICK

-- and you didnt have to Heres
my gift to you the truth You
were one of the six best players
out there

(pulling the

holdout off her)
Get rid of this

ANNABELLE
(confused embarrassed
touched)
Would you believe me if I told
you it didnt work Look -- all

the cards are still there --
Contraption just jammed on me I
couldnt get it to function
(now as her arms
go around Maverick)
Lets hope I have better luck
with you

MAVERICK

Long pause Then --

No It would be wonderful we

PULL BACK to reveal

THE COMMODORE
I had to say good-bye I couldnt
risk looking like I was rushing

and turns backtracking a lot
Made sure nobody was following me
You dont seem happy to see me

COOP
(angry)
I thought you and me were in this
thing together -- you win I do

nothing Someone else wins I do
what I did Why didnt you tell me
Angel was in it too

MAVERICK - Rev 111593 149

THE COMMODORE

What did Maverick say to that

sweet young thing ‘You never want
to give everything away If
Angeld won wed still have split
it the same way I telegraphed him
-- keep Maverick from the game He
messed that up Poor dead bastard

COOP
I just dont like secrets

one either

THE COMMODORE

as suddenly he draws his gun cocks it --

-- theres that sound again --

But Ive decided not to share it
with you --

COOP

In a perfect world thats true

in the water ready

to fire)

idiot speech about my wisdom --
how could you expect me to fall
for that You must think Im
awful damn dumb

(to Coop)
But you you fooled me And
not many can But you saved me
so I wont kill you

(beat)
Just remember the whole world
knows what you are Thats
punishment enough All your
lifes work all the good you

did you wiped it away You dont

have anything to show for it

COOP
Youre young so you dont know
that much about mistakes but
youre making one now

MAVERICK

His hands fiddle a little with the gun we cant really
see what hes doing Then he points the gun at the
Commodore as if to shoot him then at the last minute
he flicks the GUN to the side and SHOOTS The bullet
just misses the Commodore and scares him very badly

MAVERICK
Maybe the fairest thing would be
to just let one of you kill the
other -- Ill let you decide which
And with that --

MAVERICK

Not a sound

COOP

closing in Louder

COOP
Couldnt sneak up on a corpse

MAVERICK
(beat)
Actually I kind of liked that
one

MAVERICK

watching as Coop holsters his gun

COOP
Lucky for you I have a forgiving
nature

MAVERICK

I take it the Commodore will not
be a problem

( ) 154

COOP
It was worth everything to nail
that crooked bastard

MAVERICK
My pappy always said nothing was
a deeper religious experience
than cheating a cheater

COOP
(big)
Now I never once said that -- you
been misquoting me all your life
and Im sick of it --

MAVERICK
You say such dumb things Ive got
to improve them

As they look at each other --

INT FANCY BATHROOM - DUSK 155
A deck of cards It is being manipulated dazzlingly with
one hand -- exactly as Maverick did before in the
stagecoach

PULL BACK to reveal

We are in exactly the same spot as before only now it is
Coop that is manipulating the cards

Both men lie relaxed eyes closed in tubs There is a
sense of peace and harmony

TWO OF THEM
relaxed We are looking at both of their backs
Now that sound again --
-- KUH -- LICK --
MAVERICK

(doesnt bother

opening his eyes

or turning)

Satchels right here

And on that as both men open their eyes --

ANNABELLE

her gun aimed at them She moves fast grabbing their
guns their clothes Then the satchel --

ANNABELLE
(tossing something to
Maverick who catches
it -- its a silk
shirt)
Hope it fits -- just know its the
best San Francisco has to offer

PAPPY
(touched)
Isnt that sweet

MAVERICK
(snarling)
Get hold of yourself shes
robbing us

ANNABELLE
What a remarkable family
MAVERICK
(to Coop)
Howd she figure that
ANNABELLE
Give me some credit -- you dont

own the exclusive on tells --
(rattling it off as
Maverick had done
with her)
-- youre both the same height
youve got the same build youve
got the same eyes you both kiss
the same way you both draw your
guns the same way --
(a breath)
-- and you both sing the same
wrong words to ‘Amazing Grace

Now she studies their naked bodies in the tubs
CLOSEUP - ANNABELLE
ANNABELLE
Oh my yes there are just a lot

of splendid similarities

( ) 155

She smiles her dazzling smile goes to the door opens
it blows a kiss -- impossible to say to which man --
and good-bye

MAVERICK AND PAPPY

They stare at the door a moment Neither of them seems
anxious to get moving or particularly upset

PAPPY
Woman with her looks cant hide

MAVERICK
(nods )
Whenever we decide to catch her --
(snaps his fingers)
-- its done

PAPPY
(nods too)
The truth If someone had to rob
us Im glad it was my little
Annie

Hes never called her that before
MAVERICK
as this registers
MAVERICK
Your little what
(beat)

Ill tell you the real truth --
every time you got near her it

was
(squints)
Im looking for the right
word -- you are after all the

man who raised me and I hold you
in the highest respect

(beat)
It was disgusting

PAPPY
as this registers
PAPPY
(chuckles )

My my green with envy

( )

155 155
TWO OF THEM
some heat now

MAVERICK
Youre right
(beat)
After all when shes a hundred
youll only be a hundred and
thirty-five

PAPPY
I would be careful if I were you --
just know that splendid creature
was almost your stepmother

MAVERICK
She was a lot closer to being
your daughter-in-law

PAPPY
Would have been sheer disaster --
youre totally lacking in the
maturity needed to satisfy a
woman like that

MAVERICK
Not what she said

PAPPY
I know what she said about you --
and I would never humiliate you by
repeating those terrible words

MAVERICK
I dont believe you

PAPPY
Neither do I

Now they both start to laugh lie back A pause
PAPPY

What we ended up with is one half
million dollar silk shirt

MAVERICK
Quarter of a millions more like
it -- I mixed in a Sears catalog

along with the cash --

Annabelle1ll enjoy that
(beat)

Hope you enjoy this

( ) 155
MAVERICK

as he takes a quarter of a million in cash from his boot
and hands it to his father

PAPPY

There are no words for what he feels but you know he is
deeply moved by the gesture

MAVERICK

pleased and proud

TWO OF THEM

as Pappy takes the money holds it in one hand

PAPPY
(soft an emotional
moment is on the
horizon)
Bret son

MAVERICK
(quiet)
Yessir

PAPPY
(zap)
This feels like you shorted me --
Im going to count it back in the
room

MAVERICK
(zap)
That might take the rest of the
week since we all know your
trouble with counting once you
get past your fingers and toes
They look at each other

And then they smile And lie silent for a moment
Then --

CAMERA begins to PULL BACK

and now Maverick begins to hum Amazing Grace
Pappy joins him doing the harmony

CAMERA continues PULLING BACK

( ) 155
Maverick starts to sing the song
Pappy joins him doing the harmony
Its just lovely
INTEXT FANCY BATHROOM (SAN FRANCISCO) - DUSK 156
CAMERA PULLS BACK and OUT the window to reveal the
exterior of the beautiful hotel and the city of

San Francisco

The two of them sing on Their voices ring out loud and
clear

Theyve never sounded better
Lets leave them there

FINAL FADE OUT

THE END
