noise that gets louder and louder

DOOR SUPERVISOR (contd)

He reaches a larger corridor with many doors on both walls
The loud voices sound to come from one of the rooms in the
back

A small group of people - three men one of them in a white
overall and one woman - rushes out of one of those rooms in
a distance They look enraged snarling drooling blood Their
eyes are blood red They turn their heads almost at the same
time and see him and they violently freeze looking daggers
at him then they run straight to him faster and faster
snarling ferociously

The heavy pain stops him from quickly realizing whats
happening When he finally does its too late

EXT LABORATORY - DAY

A big white truck is parked just outside facing the lab
entrance door Two men two ACTIVISTS seated on the front
seats are waiting

About time

ACTIVIST 1

Theyre not carrying anything

ACTIVIST 2
Open the back doors

ACTIVIST 1 is uncertain as he still leaves his seat on his
way to open the back doors He does it and the first and only
thing he sees is his female teammate MIKA standing right in
front of him looking straight at him Her eyes are blood red
her face expressionless

The only thing she carries is one single monkey Dead covered
with blood

ACTIVIST 1
(interrogative)
Mika
She suddenly snarls and throws herself towards him making
both fall inside the truck She bites him ferociously in the
throat he yells with heavy pain

DAVID (Activist 2) turns and sees this
staying close to his seat

frozen He stands up

DAVID
Mika MIKA What the hell are you
doing What is this

MIKA stops the biting and looks up at DAVID
evil version of the woman he knows Her eyes
pointed straight at him ready to be thrown
Almost supernaturally she stands up about to attack him and
as she does DAVID sits back down and puts his foot down

DAVID can see her
He

MIKA is thrown backwards out of the truck
ending up on the pavement through his rear-view mirror

ACTIVIST 1 is still inside the truck Kind of convulsing on
the floor DAVID sees this too in his mirror He stops the
truck and turns to his mate

DAVID
Bruce

BRUCE turns abruptly showing DAVID a horrible face totally
twisted Before giving him the time to rush him DAVID opens
his door and gets out

EXT PHONE BOX

He starts running back to the truck as fury and panic gain
ground

INT TRUCK

He gets back into the truck through the drivers door and
locks it as he starts the engine again an infected shows up
banging the window DAVID drives away quickly

He turns and through the back doors that are still open he
sees that hes chased by at least two infected ones running
very fast As one of them is about to board the vehicle he
drives faster losing the thing that falls down on the
pavement

PENNY

WANDA
(after a break)

PENNY picks it up and throws it to her she puts up the volume
on a TV set Then she keeps changing channels until she stops
on BBC News
She doesnt see anything so special right away so she puts
her phone down and keeps working on her pet

INT POLICE STATION - DAY

KATHARINE HARRIS a police detective is inside her own
office on the phone behind her desk receiving an emergency
call taking notes with a pen

KATHARINE
Thank you

She stands up a piece of paper in her hand She looks dazed

She leaves her office and walks through the station strangely
empty Almost everybody has converged towards another office
A private office They are all gathered at the door and
pretty agitated all talking together at the same time

She manages to find her way through the pack and sees the
LIEUTENANT in his office seated behind his desk There is a
pile of reports on the table Hes busy reading one of them
then he gets rid of it and takes another on the pile

After a very short moment he gets rid of it as well and gets
another he gets rid of quickly then he looks up at the people
packed at his door

LIEUTENANT

What the hell is this

(as he stands up)
God knows if I have worked plenty
of cases at the same time in my
career but this

(he shakes his head)
this is nuts

He leaves his office through the human pack Nobody says a
thing to him except

KATHARINE who hands him the report she has

KATHARINE
Lieutenant we just received some
more calls we also have some
footage now coming from CCTV
operators may I suggest you have a
look
The LIEUTENANT stops and looks at her stunned He sees the
report

KATHARINE (contd)
I got all of it on my computer

LIEUTENANT
Youre not the only one Its already
everywhere

He passes her not taking the report

He looks highly surprised about how quickly all this is going
The reports had come in within less than fifteen minutes and
all of them were about the same thing

LIEUTENANT (contd)
Lets have that look I hope its not
some stupid kid joke

He goes to a corner of the station where a big screen is set
high up on a wall Its divided into 16 square screens

The LIEUTENANT enters the place almost all his squad follows
The footage is played as soon as he looks up

What they see defies our imagination It is like a riot but
with something else The police or army is not involved Only
civilian people attacking other civilian people and doing it
with extreme violence and for absolutely no reason

Everybody is watching like hypnotized unable to move and say
anything It lasts a moment until the LIEUTENANT turns

LIEUTENANT
Hey what are you doing Wake up

They all do as he speaks

LIEUTENANT (contd)
What Am I dumb or am I supposed to
go out there by myself and play Rambo
on these guys Just move and send all
units there Everything you have And
I want the whole area sealed off within
a 30-mile radius 30 miles you hear
me
The ones concerned disperse at once Some others stay close
him KATHARINE included As he watches again

ATHARINE
Sir theres something I need to show
you Its very important

LIEUTENANT
What We are watching it right now

ATHARINE

That report is about something on the
footage About what could have started
this Its there but I suggest we have
a look

LIEUTENANT
We have footage about this

ATHARINE
Apparently yes

LIEUTENANT
Lets see it

They go to a desk and a computer on it controlling the big
screen and both have a seat in front

KATHARINE
One CCTV operator found it and wrote
that report he followed to us as
quickly as he could

She starts working on the computer and soon the big screen
shows one image instead of sixteen She rewinds the image

KATHARINE (contd)
Okay apparently it all started
from that spot

The image shows a big white truck with no outside mark or
brand parking Then three black shapes coming off the
back entering a building

LIEUTENANT
What is this Some robbery

KATHARINE
It may be what happened before this
(MORE)

to
ATHARINE (contd)
whole thing started sir Those three
guys are hooded but they have no guns

LIEUTENANT
They have no guns Whats making you
so sure about that

ATHARINE

Im not sir The operator is You
should be as well when you see what
happens next Now the place they just
got in its not a bank or anything
else financial Its something else

LIEUTENANT
It can be anything Like some flat

ATHARINE
Not on this I dont think any robber
would break in any flat in downtown
London during daytime

LIEUTENANT
Dont be too sure about that either

She fast-forwards the tape

KATHARINE
From the report they came out six
minutes later

She keeps fast-forwarding until the footage shows them
coming out

Five people instead of three All acting mad And attacking
people at once

LIEUTENANT
(astonished)
My God

KATHARINE
Notice anything

LIEUTENANT
Yes thats the starting point all
right

ATHARINE
And the three guys sir the three
guys

LIEUTENANT
They brought out some friends

ATHARINE
With their hoods off They dont wear
them any more

LIEUTENANT

Thats right This means well be
able to identify them This is very
good

ATHARINE

Sir you wont be able to even go
for them Theyve gone mad Theyre
finished

LIEUTENANT
Of course

She freezes the image

ATHARINE
Anything else

LIEUTENANT
Yes the guy in white

ATHARINE
Must be some scientist Doctor or
researcher

LIEUTENANT
Oh

ATHARINE

It means that the guys broke in a
medical or research place Like a
clinic or a lab And that they
unleashed something that should have
stayed locked

LIEUTENANT
Yes holy shit

She plays the footage again

KATHARINE
Look at this

The footage shows the truck abruptly starting then stopping
about fifty yards ahead

Then the driver gets out of the truck and runs away
frantically like hes chased by the Devil Himself Until he
enters a phone box

The guy is all dressed in black like those who entered the
mysterious place Hes not hooded

LIEUTENANT
He escaped from his own friends

KATHARINE
Its possible to identify this guy

LIEUTENANT
(showing no joy)
Good you do that Very good job
(he stands up)
You do that while I alert all the
medias right away

She nods he leaves

INT TRUCK — DAY

DAVID is still heading to the school His radio is on As he
approaches the school he begins to hear about the mysterious
wave of fury

RADIO VOICE
we have to interrupt our programs
to report you of something totally
unusual currently happening on the
streets of London several assaults
still unexplained have occurred and
apparently havent stopped yet we
are waiting for more details from the
police but the motives of these
aggressions are still to be

DAVID manages to park the truck he has to turn off the radio
as he gets out He runs to the school entrance

INT VETERINARIAN SHOP — DAY

WANDA looks stunned as she watches the first TV developments
Her eyes and mouth widen

The news is hosted by one single man revealing the breaking
info WAVE OF FURY BREAKING OUT IN LONDON

NEWS HOST
It has started for about twenty
minutes and doesnt seem to have
stopped since reports from calling

no apparent reason and the number is
still growing We still have no
precisions about what is still causing
these assaults but as it develops

WANDA suddenly drops her tools and turns runs to her coat and
handbag and rushes out of the room

PENNY

The door slams the pet moans on the table
The door reopens WANDA reappears

WANDA
Penny close the place and go

She slams the door again

He leaves quickly The RECEPTIONIST notices

As DAVID climbs some stairs the two women at the reception
desk hear from a small TV set about whats happening The
sound is low but they can hear They focus on the screen
suddenly highly worried

Soon some portraits of suspects come up The RECEPTIONIST who
talked with David recognizes him quickly from one of them

She picks up the phone dials 999
INT SCHOOL - CORRIDOR

DAVID walks through an empty corridor watching the walls
looking for a door with the correct number He finally finds
it

He looks inside the classroom through a rather small square
glass window trying to spot Robert his eldest son among all
the pupils

Some of the kids turn their heads to him None of them is
Roberts but DAVID manages to locate him

He fights the urge to get into the room and drag his son out
deciding to wait for the class to finish His teeth clinch as
he looks at his watch Four minutes before the bell ring

He stays put

INT POLICE CAR (PATROL 76) - DAY

They all stay quiet in the car for some time

Both police officers look relax with the feeling of a job
well done

DAVID looks different he keeps looking outside the car left
then right then straight ahead sometimes in the back In all
directions

He doesnt look frantic But hes like hes feeling the storm
coming after calm

OFFICER 2

suddenly)

OFFICER 1

DAVID
You mean try to set animals free

OFFICER 1
Are you only aware of what youve
started

DAVID
You guys dont seem to worry very much
about that
OFFICER 1
(to his partner shrugging)

Forget it
After a short break the radio bursts out
RADIO VOICE

(female)
Patrol 76 whats with your suspect Over

OFFICER 2
(taking the radio)
Hes in the car with us ETA ten
Over

RADIO VOICE
Very well The lieutenant needs to
talk to you

As she finishes a heavy shock is heard

An infected just landed on the hood Snarling at the two cops
who gape at him

As the bloody guy moves to them with the obvious intention to
smash the windshield with one of his hands OFFICER 1 brakes

The creature is thrown off the hood

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Hello

Because of the braking the car behind them has to turn
quickly to avoid the shock It passes them and becomes the
target for another infected

We can hear a window being shattered Then some screaming
They can do nothing but watch helpless

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Hello

DAVID
God

OFFICER 2 takes out his gun as he sees another infected one
rushing to them He puts his window down and shoots All of it
very quickly The infected collapses

OFFICER 2
Drive

OFFICER 1 puts his foot down as his partner talks in the
radio again

OFFICER 2 (contd)
Lieutenant

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Yeah What happened

OFFICER 2
Weve got trouble Wait a second

They have to take a quick turn as a couple of other rabid ones
rush to them

OFFICER 2 (contd)
Lieutenant

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Youre okay

OFFICER 2
No worries so far

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Hows the suspect

Both cops turn to DAVID who looks very agitated They nod

OFFICER 2
Hes all right

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Tell him to confirm the address of that
lab they broke in
(He gives an address)
Go ahead

OFFICER 2 turns to DAVID again OFFICER 1 looks at him
through the rear-view mirror

DAVID nods a yes

OFFICER 2
(in the radio)
He said yes

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Okay Make sure hes alive and kicking and
listening We have some trouble here as well

OFFICER 2
Have you been attacked in there

LIEUTENANT (vo)

No but the place is almost empty Two
police headquarters both located in a short
distance from that lab have been overrun
So many guys here havent waited for the
same thing to happen here they went to
pick up their kids at school or straight
home Were receiving always less and less
reports of the situation and these reports
always get more and more specific about
that disease and the damage it just keeps
causing

OFFICER 1
Its a disease

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Its something in the blood So yeah its
a disease Rage Id say A secret virus

INT POLICE STATION

The lieutenant is speaking inside his office seated behind

his desk

As he speaks several police cars patrol throughout the city

of London
alternate

some of them being attacked one after another We
from one car attacked or not to another And from

POLICE STATION to PATROL 76

LIEUTENANT
m talking now to all cars and Im
asking you to listen to this without
interrupting even if you get attacked
The situation hasnt improved but it
hasnt gone worse either It can get
better only if you keep shooting those
freaky things on sight From some of the
(MORE)

LIEUTENANT
reports we received once they get
infected they start running around and
they do it very quickly frantically
without stopping until they hit
anybody else Thats mainly why its
spreading that fast The underground
traffic also helps much If possible
dont wait until they rush to you to
pull the trigger since their infected
blood may hit you and reach your eyes
or enter your mouth The situation was
considered so serious that the upper
hand was just given to the army over
the government

INT PATROL 76
BRIAN and JEFF look at each other as the LIEUTENANT continues

LIEUTENANT (vo contd)
The armys already given everyone the
instruction to stay home lock their doors
and windows and close their shutters
Theyve also posted soldiers in front of
every public place in town especially
schools and hospitals it doesnt mean you
cant use your guns on those things any
more But it means that all our regular
communications will be shut down We also
can expect radio and TV stations to stop
broadcasting in any minute until the
situation is under control again That’s
why I asked you not to try to ask any
question and to start any discussion We
dont have much time left Just keep
using our cars to go home and put your
families together and safe Many
civilians will try to leave the city
please dont do the same We need all of
you here Now this is for Patrol 76 The
other cars are dismissed Thank you

OFFICER 2
Lieutenant

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Jeff

OFFICER 2
Yes Brian is driving

LIEUTENANT (vo)
Check on our guy Check his face

JEFF
Hes looking green now He just shitted
his pants

LIEUTENANT (vo)

I guess you understood you cant bring
him here Therell be nobody to question
him not even to take him to the toilet
Youll have to let him go

DAVID
I knew it

BRIAN
Dont play with us now

DAVID
Im not I could have said that way
before but Im polite

LIEUTENANT (vo)
All this is your fault mister If I
were you I wouldnt be so proud

DAVID
Go say that to those who made that
stinky virus

LIEUTENANT (vo)

Im saying that to you You were stupid
enough to try to release animals that
have been injected with all kinds of shit
You also know that most lab experiments
are classified Its your only fault

BRIAN
Lieutenant instead of letting him go
what about shooting him right away He
deserves to pay he should pay

DAVID
I wasnt inside the lab I didnt see
what happened If we knew for sure that
(MORE)

DAVID (contd)
the chimps were infected with that shit
wed have shot them all instead of
trying to set them free

LIEUTENANT (vo)
No excuses please Youre the ones who
released that thing Nobody else did

DAVID
Im not saying otherwise Do you really
believe we didnt suffer My own friends
attacked me Now theyre gone I really
lucked out

LIEUTENANT (vo)
You guys take him home Once there with
his family he wont be able to go
anywhere its too dangerous I guess he
knows it better than anybody else Over
and out

He cuts JEFF puts down the radio

DAVID
(after a few seconds of silence)
Well I would say you aint cops any more
What do you say

BRIAN
Youre right asshole but you know
what We aint taxi drivers either

DAVID

JEFF

home youre out of your mind

DAVID
And what about what your lieutenant
said

BRIAN

You just told us we aint cops any
more Youre right about that And
our radio communications will be shut
down at any time Hell never know

JEFF
Unless you go report to him at the
station but I dont believe you wanna
do that

Both ‘cops’ reach the next corner then BRIAN stops the car
He takes out his gun And has looks all around

EXT PATROL 76
He gets out of the vehicle his gun in his hand not pointed
Nothing suspect around him so he opens one of the back doors

BRIAN
Get out

DAVID
(getting out)
Youre leaving me here

BRIAN
Turn around

DAVID
Thats not what youre supposed to do

BRIAN
(as he uncuffs DAVID)
I know But we have families too
We dont have time for you Just take
the underground or a cab

JEFF joins them his gun in his hand as well looking around

JEFF
(handing something to DAVID)
Take it
DAVID

Whats that

JEFF
What does it look like Its a walkie-
talkie Its on my private frequency
Keep it carefully and use it if you
manage to get home
(as DAVID takes the device)
Good luck asshole
Both cops get back in their car and drive away

EXT STREETS - DAY

DAVID stays there not moving And not totally believing
After escaping from infection and doing everything so his
family doesnt have to face it he is exposed again

With a fair chance to escape from it again though

But he doesnt know at once what to do or which way to go He
doesnt even know where exactly he is

He stays there like hes waiting for a taxi But theres no
one coming

From the lieutenant on his radio he knows the underground is
no more an option

So he keeps waiting

EXT SCHOOL — DAY

Davids kids ROBERT EMILIA and VEE are in quite the same
situation waiting for their mother to come and pick them up

They look rather anxious since they can hear more and more
sirens from more or less big distances

ROBERTs phone rings He takes the call

WANDA (vo)
Robert

ROBERT
Mum

WANDA (vo)
Are you in front of the gate

ROBERT
Yes were all waiting What are
you doing

INT WANDAS CAR

WANDA
Ill be right there baby Im so sorry
Im blocked at an intersection
(she sees an infected one
get into the traffic)
look I have to hang up just stay
where you are Ill be right there

She cuts and watches for a moment The infected one a girl
manages to smash a car window The people in the car scream in

terror

The light goes green but theres no car moving And no horn
yelling

WANDA turns her wheel and gets on the sidewalk driving away
from the scene just as some other cars finally follow and
as another infected one shows up attacking another car still
stopped

EXT STREETS - DAY

DAVIDs still standing at the same spot Still no taxi

He looks at the radio device Jeff gave him Unusable despite
the operational frequency

He takes his cell phone out of his pocket Usable Yes His
networks still operational

But his batterys almost dead

He looks around trying to find a street name he can use The
first valuable thing he sees is

an infected one running frantically from a distance
looking around for a prey Then running straight to somebody
and attacking with amazing ferocity

DAVID looks away escapes from that sight of savagery
surrounded by panic He dials a number

INT CAR - DAY

WANDA can hear her phone ringing as she approaches the school
So she cant take the call

EXT SCHOOL — DAY

ROBERT EMILIA and VEE are still waiting outside among a
growing number of other kids waiting as well Its not school
bus time yet The gate is wide open theres one soldier in
his uniform standing close by holding a machine gun and
carrying a gun in a pocket

WANDAs car finally gets on the street at high speed But she
loses control and hits a parked car

And there it stays The engine has stopped
WANDA is not injured but looks knocked down

EMILIA and ROB
(simultaneously)
MUM

The three kids run to the car which is not seriously smashed
ROBERT manages to open the drivers seat and sees her mother
half unconscious

He shakes her as hard as he can

ROBERT

Mum Mum come on
(keeping shaking her)
Come on Wake up

The two others start crying as ROBERT keeps shaking and
shouting

Then some heavy snarling ROBERT hears it despite the
weeping He freezes

He slams the door opens the back one and rushes his brother
sister and himself into the car

INT WANDAS CAR

He locks both back doors then he takes the passengers seat
quickly and locks both front doors

ROBERT
(harshly)
Get down and keep quiet

He takes his still unconscious mum down with him as the two
others obey

ROBERT (contd)
Now dont move an inch
EXT SCHOOL - DAY
On the outside two infected ones get closer coming from
different directions One of them runs straight to the small
group of kids The other one stops on the sidewalk close to
the parked car
INT WANDAS CAR
ROBERT
(whispering)
Both of you hit the floor And

dont make a sound

As EMILIA and VEE reach the floor WANDA moans a little
ROBERT puts a hand on her mouth

EXT CAR

The creature is still standing on the sidewalk snarling in
the empty still seeming to wonder which car to tear apart

It moves quickly reaching the front of WANDAs car It stands
there waiting for some signal to attack and sees nothing
feels no movement inside right away

EXT SCHOOL

The other creature approaches the group at high speed roaring
with dementious rage ready to attack and bite deep

Holding his machine gun in his left hand the SOLDIER uses his
other hand to take out his gun He aims and fires Only
once

The infected one drops dead shot in the chest

EXT CAR

The thing hears the gunshot and turns his torn face to the
group with a mad snarl

And it runs to them like crazy screaming louder than ever

The SOLDIER fires again
INT WANDAS CAR

ROBERT moves up The thing is gone He starts working
mum again

ROBERT
Mum Mum Wake up Mum come on

After a short moment she finally emerges

WANDA
Oh Rob

The three kids hug their mum from all sides
WANDA (contd)
(holding her head)
What happened

ROBERT
Youve had a little accident

She seems to remember

WANDA
Oh

She shakes her head

EMILIA
Mum I wanna go home

WANDA
Sure baby

She turns her key but the engine just splutters She
two three more times No positive result
Then she looks up and freezes

looking straight at her

the glass two times

ts the SOLDIER WANDA puts the glass down

SOLDIER
Hello guys Sorry if I scared you

on his

tries

A shape is standing on the outside right in front of the car

Then it moves to the side It stops by her door and knocks on

WANDA
Its all right

SOLDIER
Is everything okay

WANDA
Not really

SOLDIER
I see I have many kids with me they
need to go home but their parents
havent showed yet Is it possible for
you to take some of them Wed really

WANDA
Wed love to but I think my car is
dead

SOLDIER

Try again

She does turning the ignition key again two more times
Nothing

SOLDIER (contd)
Keep your foot down on the accelerator
It will go

She presses the accelerator and turns the key again and after
a little time the engine starts at last

ROBERT
YES

SOLDIER
Good Please stop by the school gate

WANDA
Okay

As she drives to the gate the soldier takes out his machine
gun for better cover

EXT STREETS — DAY

A soldier in his uniform is unloading his machine gun Hes
standing inside a big army jeep along with some other
soldiers One of them is also firing

Many people get ruthlessly riddled with bullets before going
down We dont know if they are infected or not The guys
dont take any risk

Then another soldier not holding a weapon jumps off the
vehicle He takes out a gun as he walks to the bodies for
checking Some of the faces are torn the others are not

He turns his body head and gun to a shape a man-like being
standing not far from the scene not moving

The soldier hesitates From where he is the guys face looks
normal

Its DAVID He puts his hands in the air

DAVID
Im okay Im not infected

The soldier puts his gun away looking around for safety

SOLDIER
All right

DAVID
I made the call about this

SOLDIER

Nothing and nobody

Relieved or kind of he gets inside every room opens every
window and closes all the shutters Then he goes back

Several enraged shapes are running straight to them
INT HOUSE - HALLWAY

They manage to get inside and DAVID locks the door just before
a big thud hits it followed by more

The hallway is almost totally dark

FADE TO BLACK

CARD 9 HOURS AFTER VIRUS OUTBREAK

FADE IN

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A TV screen a news break emerges

A woman is showed on the street She holds a microphone
acting like everything is normal

WOMAN
Were about to enter the closest
police station from Buckingham Palace
its also the most protected and
guarded one The city is on high
alert but lets see if well be
able to collect some valuable info
about the situation

She enters the building Inside she sees people some with
army uniforms some others with police uniforms

WANDA
Nothing else

DAVID and WANDA are seated beside each other in a couch
facing the set

The screen shows the woman stopping a SOLDIER

WOMAN
Sir

The man turns to her then to the CAMERA

SOLDIER
No photos no interviews please

WOMAN
Could you tell us how the situation
is evolving

SOLDIER
Were doing the best we can Thats
all I can say

WOMAN
Anything else

SOLDIER
Yes Turn off that camera and go
home Thats the best you can do
to help us Thats it

DAVID and WANDA smile at each other

The light is on in the room there are also many lighted
candles all across it and all across the house in case the
light goes off

DAVID changes the channel and sees a blank screen

He continues changing channels And finally comes back to the
still broadcasting one

This time the WOMAN stands close to a POLICE OFFICER

POLICE OFFICER
the most important thing to
understand is that people must stay
home and lock themselves up but
many of them dont follow that very
simple instruction or make mistakes
do stupid things like throwing
parties and making noise From where
we are weve been receiving reports
of families attacked in their homes
As long as this kind of thing occurs
this plague - because we can call it
a plague - will always gain ground
You want to know about the situation
Its not good and its not getting
any better I wont lie to make people
feel better Even if we get this
situation under control again there
will be many casualties

WOMAN
What about the Royal Family

POLICE OFFICER
You can check for yourself outside
Buckingham Palace is closed to the
public and it will stay closed until
this is definitely behind us Thank
you

WOMAN
Thank you for talking to us officer

POLICE OFFICER
Now you should go home Especially if
you have a family Its dangerous on
(MORE)

POLICE OFFICER (contd)
the streets In case you dont know
there is an army of psychopaths
growing out there

WOMAN
Thanks again
(to the CAMERA)
Lets go back outside and try to get
closer to Buckingham Palace where some
Royal Family members took refuge a few
hours ago

The screen goes blank DAVID just changed the channel

WANDA

She stands up and walks to the chimney Some pork ribs are
roasting inside

She opens the chimney and works on the ribs with a fork
Then she closes the chimney puts the fork down stands back
up and comes back to DAVID sitting down close to him like

Robert Emilia and Vee are sleeping on another couch Theyre

STREETS - NIGHT

JEFF approaches the police station He turns off his car
lights and parks not far from the parking lot

He takes out one of his guns checks its fully loaded does
the same with another one

He gets out of the car and walks slowly and silently to the

parking lot then he walks through it very carefully looking
around one of his guns pointed

Everything is quiet Its almost all dark around despite some
street lights still on

He quickly reaches a back door but he cant open it Then he
quickly gets back in the police car shadows and protection

He moves again heading to the stations main entrance through
the parking lot He reaches the right level then he runs to
the entrance door He opens it and gets in the building

All of it very silently

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Its weakly lighted by wall sources activated by the usual
spare generator The visibility is okay everything is quiet
as well

JEFF keeps walking through the station until he reaches a
range of lockers

He opens one of them having to make some noise The gun room
Not totally empty Some weapons and ammunition boxes left
among some other things

He enters the small room and takes all

Hes so busy doing it making more noise hes still able to
hear a creaking sound from the outside

Quickly he turns around pointing a gun

At two dark weakly lighted shapes standing outside in
different positions but their heads turned to him

At once they snarl savagely
JEFF fires twice They drop dead

He picks up one last gun and leaves the empty room two guns
pointed

As he sees more shapes snarling running to him he shoots at
those coming from the entrance side Fortunately they are less
numerous than those coming from the other side

EXT POLICE STATION

He leaves the building chased by four rabid creatures One of
them wears the police uniform

He runs through the parking lot to his civilian car heavily
loaded The infected get closer so he has no choice but
turning to them and fire

He kills two more the closest ones quite easily Then he
runs again approaching his car

As he reaches it he turns around drops his loot and shoots
the before last one of them This leaves him just enough time
to pick up a riot mask and to put it on just as the last one
reaches him his mouth wide open

The creature is so fast it manages to disarm JEFF who grabs
his throat as the creature falls down on him

They both fall down JEFF ends up under the rabid guy but he
keeps squeezing its throat as he keeps its face away from him

The creature suddenly spits a whole lot of blood down at JEFF
whos now almost blind his mask red spoiled with infected
blood

They keep fighting that way for about half a minute rolling
around on the pavement JEFF keeping squeezing the infected
keeping snarling and spitting blood at him

Until the infected stops moving Strangled choked to death

Everything is quiet again

Both stay motionless for a moment Then JEFF stands up
slowly

He takes off his bloody mask and drops it Then he picks up
his gun and looks around Nothing

He takes out his keys opens the front door of his civilian
car and throws the arsenal inside the vehicle the spoiled
mask included

Then he gets in the car starts the engine

-but he doesnt drive away Not yet
He takes a long breath then he picks up his two guns he
reloads them then he takes his flashlight

and he gets off the car

He walks back to the station his guns pointed staying
carefully away from the infected dead bodies

INT POLICE STATION

Once inside he turns on the flashlight The building is
definitely empty and quiet

He heads to the main room To his own desk

He opens one of the drawers (the biggest one) and takes
several radio devices out of it

CUT TO

EXT POLICE STATION

He gets back in his car gets rid of his stuff starts the
engine and drives off the parking lot at full speed

LIVING ROOM

The whole family is around the dining table along with JEFF
They all look very tired But they cant go to sleep

WANDA
(about the numerous lighted
candles on the table and all
across the room and house)
All this has nothing to do with

pans with the dinner inside

WANDA
Thank you

JEFFs radio gear is also on the table And its on as well
Some voices break off once in a while

DAVID
What can you get with this

JEFF
Everything

WANDA
Which is

JEFF
As you know David the police radio
comms have been shut off Now the army
is leading this but they still
collaborate with the police ata
certain level notably with some of
our mounted division Especially about
the protection of the Royal family and
the government With this I can
pick up their chats from their
walkie-talkies And keep myself
posted about the situation

DAVID
Why did you bring all that stuff in
here

JEFF

Why not Its better than a black
TV screen Dont you think so

DAVID
I dont know

JEFF
You dont know Im not sure if youre
really aware of the seriousness of
the situation

DAVID
I am dont worry about it I have
survived many attacks today And I am
probably the only one to have done
so

JEFF
You lucked out David Thats what
you said Since this started youve
been very lucky And because of that
you may believe that everybody else
will be as lucky as you have been
and still are You were the first
man exposed to the infection and
also the first one who survived an
attack So you began with sort of
an advantage You were prepared
when nobody else was Think about
that

DAVID says nothing

JEFF (contd)
(to him)
I need to talk to you privately

Both men stand up

DAVID

All right
JEFF
(to WANDA)

It wont be long Your kids dont
need to hear this

lab monkeys you guys tried to set
free right

DAVID
Im talking about normal animals
not lab guinea-pigs

JEFF
Whats the difference A virus can
mutate and adapt to any environment
Lab or not

DAVID
What do you know about it

JEFF
Its pretty obvious you dont need
to be an expert to know that There
are many dead bodies all across
London now you know lying on the
streets I guess cats and dogs also
foxes come to those bodies and lick
the blood off them

DAVID
Of course I hadnt thought of that

JEFF
I think that the infection spreads
like this at night Most of the way

DAVID
My God

JEFF
As soon as I saw those cats rushing
to me their faces I saw that this

would be real hell

DAVID
We have to deal with infected
humans as well as with infected
animals

JEFF

The army doesnt bother too much to
take the bodies away When its the
first and most important thing they
have to do

DAVID
Did you see the bodies in front of
the house as you were coming

JEFF
(after a pause)
I did see some yes

DAVID
Lets go back

EXT BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

The most important number of soldiers has been deployed all
around the big long royal building Inside and outside the
property on both sides of the triple-locked gates they stand
on the sidewalks and pavements surrounding the building
pistols and machine guns and shotguns ready to be fired There
are also many officers from the police mounted division men
and women young and old slowly riding their horses rifles
in hands The lights have been kept on all around so they can
see whats happening

The show is impressive but its not for the tourists And its
not a show

Once in a while a soldier takes out a walkie-talkie and
speaks soon imitated by another one and so on

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
All their communications are captured by JEFFs gear DAVID

an infected one rushes to a standing

who turns his head and fires his machine gun
riddled with bullets

The

Then the soldier uses his radio And keeps watching

Mayday

SOLDIER
(in his radio)

Theyre coming

I just nailed one here

The alert increases Soon two more infected are put down by
the soldiers A few seconds later another one is killed by a
cop on his horse

INT LIVING ROOM

The radio communications get intense After a moment they get
back to normal

JEFF
Do you have a generator

DAVID

JEFF
(shrugs)
Thats too bad But it doesnt really
matter

DAVID his wife and kids are still around the table with JEFF
They have finished dinner

WANDA
hat do you mean by that

JEFF

What they have to say doesnt matter
Unless something goes badly wrong And
in case something serious happens to
them at Buckingham or Number 10 or any
other key point of the city theyll
have to cut off the power around so
the infected cant see them

DAVID
hen they will use infra-red equipment

JEFF

Exactly All we can do is hope that
they dont get overrun so the power
stays on

WANDA
And if they have to cut off the power
that our block doesnt get hit

JEFF
If they cut off the power they will
hit all blocks Those guys dont move
slow

EXT ARMY QUARTER —- NIGHT

WANDA (vo)
Neither do the infected

As she says that a soldier is chased by a snarling infected
gal

The quarter is savagely attacked Its a small two-floor
facility deserted by its usual staff and taken by the army
Some gunshots are fired from pistols and machine guns some
infected ones drop but they are quickly replaced

The soldier runs frantically as fast as possible from the
mad girl who just keeps running after him without showing any
sign of fatigue

As we believe he may lose her another infected rushes him
from a side Hes thrown to the ground and the two infected
fall down on him

Immediately they all get shot from nowhere

Inside the quarter the gunshots progressively die down In the
end there are no more shots The attackers run away first but
they dont have time to go far They get shot as well
systematically

After a very short moment the lying soldiers who are still
alive stand up again quickly Infected They all run
away and get shot in their turn

The shooting came from a flat above

We can see the smoking ends of two machine guns but not those
who hold them

INT POLICE STATION (BUCKINGHAM) - MAIN ROOM

A police officer is receiving a report by phone

POLICE OFFICER
Okay Thank you so much for your call

The female journalist and her camera man are inside working
and broadcasting talking to another police officer

The first one hangs up Then he walks to the closest soldier

POLICE OFFICER (contd)
One of your quarters just got attacked

SOLDIER
(his eyes wide opening)
This is impossible We havent received
any comm about this And how do you
know that anyway

POLICE OFFICER
I just received a phone call

SOLDIER
A phone call from who

POLICE OFFICER
Not from your friends

SOLDIER
Witnesses then

POLICE OFFICER
Im afraid so

SOLDIER
Did they tell you where

POLICE OFFICER
Northwest of the city Close to
Wembley

SOLDIER
Shit

He walks away To a table with a group of other soldiers in
their uniforms standing by

One of them a sergeant picks up a device and calls loudly

SERGEANT
Captain Hebron do you copy

EXT NUMBER 10 —- NIGHT

The comm is not taken by any of the numerous soldiers standing
by the building Its all quiet there

INT DAVIDS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

But it is captured by JEFFs gear Soon some other voices
break off making it a mess

A mess not loud enough to wake up the kids

WANDA
Where is this coming from

INT POLICE STATION
SERGEANT
(putting down his device)
There is no response Send a vehicle
or a chopper over there We need to
know what happened

As he speaks some noise can be heard from the outside
Shooting

SERGEANT (contd)
(pointing at two soldiers)

You two go now Get the chopper

The two designated soldiers rush to the back of the room to a
door they pass

HALLWAY

They go upstairs climbing some stairs

EXT BUCKINGHAM PALACE

The soldiers and mounted police officers have to face another
attack

The infected are more numerous than before Plenty of them
drop very quickly from a big distance

One of them gets closer and closer to a soldier who just ran
out of bullets Fortunately as its about to reach him and

bite deep the roaring creature drops shot from aside by a
mounted cop with a shotgun

he lucky guy looks up at the cop who just keeps firing his
hotgun aiming to the right then left etc So are all the
other soldiers and cops

n

The lucky guy reloads and gets back to it

INT POLICE STATION

Which is also attacked in the meantime Six infected ones
(among them two soldiers) manage to get inside snarling
with hunger and fury blood dropping from their mouths

Everybody else inside freezes gaping at them with horror The
cameraman captures it walking backwards

CAMERA MAN
Oh God

The shooting starts and the WOMAN starts yelling

NT DAVIDS HOUSE —- LIVING ROOM

They can hear the heavy noise The comm hasnt been cut off
WANDA stands up terrified She finds the force not to scream
as well

NT POLICE STATION

The shooting continues four infected drop dead one soldier
included whatever on the floor or on the tables

4d

he other infected soldier suddenly turns to one of his mates
ho is standing close staring at himit with horror unable
o shoot It rushes him they fall down on the floor and it
ites him frantically at the throat with extreme violence
he guy yells

IOodc se

The last infected civilian (a woman) rushes to the screaming
woman and her camera man He sees it she doesnt too busy
yelling with terror and blowing her ears

A soldier shoots at the monster with his machine gun but hes
panicked and misses many times giving it the opportunity to
reach the two TV workers

The cameraman passes her and hits the snarling thing with
his camera Its not powerful enough to knock it down but it

gives it the time to get finally shot once Its thrown
against the wall by the impact

It stands up again looking daggers first at the still working
and filming camera man then at the soldier who got closer He
shoots it at point blank in the head

In the meantime the last one is finished by its victim who
manages to shoot it from under

His fellow soldiers are around him and watch the infection
make its effect The woman is still yelling too terrified to
be aware of anything her camera man doesnt pay attention he
comes over to the scene and tries to capture it but hes kept
away by two of the boys

SOLDIER
(pushing him back)
Go shut her up

The guy turns enraged his eyes turn red some blood start
dripping off his mouth and nose

Then he looks around at his mates his face twisted his
teeth clinched He doesnt have the time to attack

One of his mates puts a gun on him

SERGEANT
Not in the head

The guy aims at the things chest and fires

NT DAVIDS HOUSE -— LIVING ROOM

4d

he comm is still on but theres no more noise

WANDA sits back down Very slowly her face very pale

The three kids are still asleep on the couch far from
everything

DAVID
(to WANDA)
Maybe you could take the kids to bed

She nods stands back up and walks away

INT POLICE STATION

The soldiers keep standing around their two dead mates for a
long moment

One of them moves to the TV workers The CAMERA MAN is holding
the sobbing WOMAN tight

SOLDIER
Youve had enough You almost got
yourselves killed

CAMERA MAN
I know Its part of the job risks

SOLDIER
You still want to stay around

CAMERA MAN
We need to cover this Dont worry
about us

SOLDIER

(gesturing at the sobbing WOMAN)
Are you serious

The CAMERA MAN doesnt say anything more the SOLDIER looks at
them with despair and walks away

He joins his group The SERGEANT gets to the table and picks
up the radio

EXT ARMY QUARTER - NIGHT

The helicopter approaches the building and soon hits the
ground Five armed soldiers come out with their weapons
pointed two of them stay close to the chopper the others
walk to the building and can immediately see the damage

Dead bodies everywhere on the pavement and sidewalk Soldiers
and civilians with all their faces twisted and their eyes
blood red

SOLDIER 1

EXT ARMY QUARTER

They meet again just outside Again they check the bodies all
riddled with bullets Then they nod to each other and without
saying anything they look up

SOLDIER 2

They follow the direction and all point their weapons at a
light source from a flat above The light source is pointed
straight at them

SOLDIER 1

INT DAVIDS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

JEFF
Theyll cut off the electricity Im
pretty sure about that They dont
have a choice

He takes his flashlight out of his coat and checks it

WANDA
Ill check whats on TV

She stands up and goes to pick the TV remote control As she
uses it to turn the TV on she quickly notices something
burning in the chimney

The WOMAN appears on the screen Shes still inside the police
station

WANDA (contd)
Come on guys look at this

DAVID and JEFF stand up in their turns and come over

DAVID
(frowning)
Theyre still broadcasting

JEFF
(looks surprised)
pparently yes

Pa

WANDA
(frowning)
She looks different than before

WOMAN
after suffering a couple of bloody
attacks the army has decided to cut
off the power throughout the city of
London but only during night time in
order to fight the threat more
effectively To the people who are
watching this and who dont have a
generator please get as many candles
and flashlights as you can The
electricity will go off in five
minutes from now Take great care of
yourselves I wish all of you a
normal peaceful night anyway We
will be back on track first time next
morning at sunrise

The CAMERA turns to a SOLDIER standing by

SOLDIER
And of course stay home all your doors
and windows carefully locked If you
have parties planned postpone them
and wait until the problem is solved
(his eyes drift to the woman)
Come over follow me

The CAMERA follows the SOLDIER and soon captures his dead
mates on the floor It ZOOMS in on the twisted bloody faces
Faces of nightmare

DAVID
(horrified)
Jesus

WANDA
Is that what you saw

DAVID
Yes

JEFF
Me too

WANDA
We all did

DAVID

Turn it off Ive seen enough
As WANDA turns off the TV DAVID goes back to his seat and
holds his head in his hands

DAVID (contd)
(after a moment)
If even groups of soldiers can get
infected with all the weapons they
have

JEFF
Yeah but in the dark they will have
the advantage Lets hope they will
eliminate the threat during this night

WANDA
We should all go to bed

DAVID
(with a big sigh)
Yes

JEFF
Thats the only thing we can do now
Ill turn these off

WANDA
Ill take care of the fire

As JEFF turns off his radio gear WANDA goes to the chimney
squats by it opens its door

The thing burning inside is still there Its not a pile of
wood Its something else Something roasting WANDA frowns
with disgust from the smell

As she gives it a poke the thing moves very slightly A
part of it turns to her

WANDA opens her eyes wide as she understands but its too
late

With a muffled growl the roasting thing leaps off the chimney

and reaches her hand
And bites
WANDA screams with the burning pain as well as with horror

DAVID and JEFF turn to her to the ball of fire sticking to
her hand

DAVID
WANDA
WANDA
(still yelling)
HELP ME Take that thing off me

JEFF takes out his gun and points it Both men go to her not
knowing too much what to do

JEFF
Wanda stop moving

He gets closer aims carefully and fires

The thing is thrown off WANDAs hand to the floor where it
starts moving and rolling around furiously and frantically

Soon it reaches the back of the den and the long curtains
setting fire to them

As JEFF keeps his eyes on the still roasting and rolling
thing DAVID looks down at his trembling gasping wife He
squats by her

DAVID
Baby youre okay

WANDAs burned hand is bleeding very bad the blood coming off
it almost black But soon the blood starts coming off from
another part of her shaking body

Horrified DAVID sees his wife turning into the same kind of
rabid thing he saw before at the lab He stands up quickly
with a hiccup

In the meantime JEFF shoots the frenzy ball of fire again
killing it for good as the curtains combust progressively
rather quickly He manages to get them down on the floor and
starts working on the fire with his feet And finally controls
it surrounded by black heavy smoke

He still can see whats going on WANDA now infected still on
the floor her husband walking slowly backwards away from
her his face in total pain

He coughs and WANDA suddenly turns to him with a furious
snarl Her face has totally changed Her eyes have turned
blood red

Shes finished
JEFF puts his gun on her

DAVID
(crying out)
NO Dont do it

JEFF
Shut the fuck up David Keep away

JEFF keeps his gun on herit as DAVID keeps walking backwards
away Slowly His face is in tears The rabid thing keeps its
eyes on JEFF and his pointed gun

Suddenly at full speed it bolts up and charges at JEFF He
fires as quickly

It gets hit in the shoulder and is thrown backwards falling
heavily on its back Thats not enough to calm it down

JEFF fires again one more time shooting it in the leg so it
cant rush him again It roars with pain The noise is awful

JEFF
(his eyes still on it)
David

He gets no response

JEFF (contd)
David

He looks at him DAVID is like paralyzed Unable to move and
say a word

JEFF (contd)
(yelling)
DAVID

DAVID moves a bit And looks at JEFF

JEFF (contd)
My blackjack is in my coat on the
chair Go take it and give it to me

DAVID moves to the other side of the table He reaches JEFFs
coat and finally takes the blackjack out of one of his inside
pockets

JEFF (contd)
Throw it to me Come on

DAVID throws the object to JEFF who catches it with his free
hand Then JEFF starts walking to the mad thing on the floor
with much precaution his pointed gun in one hand his
blackjack in the other It cant rush him no more but it
still can spit blood towards his face And he doesnt have his
mask

The door opens and ROBERT appears in the doorway in pyjamas
not coming in He sees his father first

ROBERT
Dad Whats happening here
Whats that smell

The smell gets quickly too strong and he puts a hand up to his
mouth and nose with a moan

They all turn to him with totally different expressions as
he looks around the heavily smoky room While JEFF and DAVID
show total surprise the thing on the floor snarls furiously
and despite its shot leg it charges at the kid crawling
frantically to his legs

JEFF knocks it on the head with his blackjack before it can
reach the boy He does it again so it doesnt move any more

ROBERT his hand still blowing his nose gapes at what used to
be his mother It doesnt last long DAVID grabs him and
leaves the room

JEFF closes the door before too much smoke runs out He puts
the blackjack on the table then he looks around takes out a
pair of cuffs and his gun still on the unconscious creatures
head he closes them around one of its wrists and drags the
bleeding body until he ties the hand to a pipe running close
to the floor far away enough from the door

This done he quickly moves away from the body takes out a
hankie and puts it up to his nose catching his breath through
the still heavy smoke

He finds his way back to one of the windows The one with no
more curtains in front

With his two hands he opens it then he opens the shutter and
immediately points his gun around

Its all quiet outside Not a movement not a sound but some
light wind The street lights are still on Not for long

The burned smoking curtains are still lying on the floor
JEFF has to turn his face away from the outside for two
seconds as he picks them up then he throws them out

The curtains end up on some human shape moving very close
His face covered JEFF gasps with horror as the shape
struggles to get rid of the big piece of tissue

As it finally does it roars horribly at JEFF showing an
awfully rabid face and big blood red eyes lit up by the
candles reflected in them
JEFF manages to shoot it fast and it drops without a sound
JEFF
(panting)
What the f Shit

Still panting hard he looks down at the ground outside and
sees only the smoky curtains partly covering the dead body

just as a shroud would

As he does it a CARD appears fading in
14 HOURS AFTER VIRUS OUTBREAK

The CARD is still on as the street lights go off Total
darkness outside

JEFF (contd)
Dammit

He closes the shutter fast and the CARD fades out Only a
couple of seconds later a thud hits it hard

He closes the window as DAVID shows up

DAVID
What happened

Another thud this time muffled

JEFF
I had to open a window

DAVID
Why
JEFF
What do you think Close the door
(as DAVID closes the door)
I had to there was no more air And
I had to get rid of the curtains

DAVID
Why did you fire your gun

JEFF
Dont you hear that

DAVID can hear the muffled banging on the shutters with the
snarling going with it

JEFF (contd)
Watch your wife

DAVID
I know

JEFF
Stay away from her

DAVID looks down at herit still lying unconscious by the
pipe as JEFF walks back to the table

He picks up his flashlight turns it on and puts it down on
the burned little animal on the floor

DAVID
What do you think it is

JEFF
(shaking his head)
No idea It could be anything dog
fox skunk one sure thing it was
very young And it stinks

He comes closer to DAVID and together they look down at what
used to be called Wanda

JEFF puts his gun on it

JEFF (contd)
Your decision Try to make it quick

DAVID
(shaking his head)
I cant make such a decision now

JEFF
Yeah whatever She can wait The
first thing you need to do is make
sure your son doesnt tell his brother
and sister about what he saw here

DAVID
Yeah

JEFF
Can you handle that

DAVID
Ill have to

JEFF examines the door There is a lock on it

JEFF
Do you have a key for this door

DAVID
Its upstairs

JEFF
Okay this door needs to be locked
for the night So your kids dont have
a chance to see their mother like this
(DAVID nods)
And it would be better if you and your
kids stay in the same room tonight

DAVID
Sure

JEFF
All right Lets extinguish the candles
and go upstairs Come on

Without keeping watching the thing on the floor JEFF picks up
his blackjack from the table then DAVID blows off one of the
candles and

JEFF

(shaking his head)

DAVID nods takes out a key off one of his pockets He unlocks
the door as JEFF cocks his pointed gun And as some snarl
gets heard

JEFF gets against the wall

JEFF (contd)
Stay behind me

DAVID gets against the wall behind JEFF who pushes the door
open without going into the living

Some heavy snarl but no infected coming out

JEFF (contd)
(nodding)
All right Were going in You stay
behind me and you dont show her your
face Understand

DAVID
Yes

JEFF nods then he takes out his riot mask and puts it on -
then his gun and flashlight still pointed he enters the

LIVING ROOM

ct

he thing in front of him DAVID carefully following a hankie
up on his nose

The thing is half squatted half lying its arm still tied to
the pipe Made more furious than ever by heavy blood hunger
and the light sent straight to its face

JEFF and DAVID progress inside the room away from it

JEFF
Go on switch on the TV

DAVID
I would if I knew where the control is

JEFF moves his flashlight around catches the device DAVID
goes for it

JEFF
Easy

DAVID picks up the device pushes a button and switches on
the TV set

JEFF (contd)
(removing his mask)
The power is back on

The channel is broadcasting live from the Buckingham Palace
area With a big difference its now showing images from CCTV
cameras around and inside the police station Alternating from
one camera to another

DAVID
This doesnt look so good

JEFF
Its still better than a black screen

DAVID
The TV guys must have been attacked

JEFF
Maybe they got home

DAVID
Look at the doors

JEFF
I see theyre all closed It doesnt

mean a thing

DAVID
Hope youre right

He changes channels and finds nothing else

DAVID (contd)
Great

He gets back to the only channel still broadcasting before
turning to the spot where what used to be his wife is stuck
Its still snarling hard Struggling as hard to turn loose

He can hear it suddenly vomiting

DAVID (contd)
Oh God

JEFF
Hey David look at this

DAVID turns back to the screen They see a soldier entering
the frame followed by two people

They recognize the female TV journalist followed by her
camera man

The soldier knocks three times on the police stations
entrance door which is opened from the outside And the two
TV workers walk out The soldier closes the door

Only a few seconds later the light is turned on

Both men are totally caught off guard by this So isa
little boy by something else He starts screaming very loud
with terror JEFF and DAVID turn around and see ROBERT in the
doorway The kid just saw his mother Or whats left of her

DAVID
(yelling as well)
ROB What the hell are you doing here
ROBERT
MOMMY MOMMY NO

His mommy roars furiously as a response fighting even hard to
turn loose Her wrist is bleeding hard under and around the
tight braces

DAVID
Get away from her

JEFF
(putting his mask back on)
Take him away

He grabs DAVID forcing him to his son as he stands between
DAVID takes ROBERT out of the room JEFF closes the door

He still can hear ROBERT crying loud and David saying

DAVID (os)
Stop Youll wake up the others

Then JEFF looks at the thing and has a gasp What he sees is
horrible What used to be Wanda is lying in a large and thick
pool of her own infected blood Blood from her two bullet
wounds and from her vomiting

The creature had changed horribly its nothing more than a
human shape painted in red blood with spoiled clothes anda
torn face in a grotesque position

AS JEFF takes out his gun and puts it on it a CARD fades in
18 HOURS AFTER VIRUS OUTBREAK

The thing almost calms down asking for him to shoot
But he doesnt

nstead he walks away to the TV screen putting his gun down
removing his mask

The CARD fades away

The WOMAN had started talking Shes standing OUTSIDE the
station with soldiers surrounding her

WOMAN
the sun is rising over London now
and the electricity was just put back on
all over the city by the army which
unfortunately had to suffer some other
attacks and casualties during the night
The situation has not improved so the
instructions remain the same for
everyone stay locked up in your homes
dont open your doors and windows to
anyone and watch your youngest kids
very carefully in case of banging on
your doors so they dont open them Some
other army units are expected to come
from other cities not only in England
but also from other countries such as
Belgium France or Holland London was
declared yesterday in a state of siege
please dont misinterpret our presence
on the streets theyre totally dead
except around some of the key spots like
this one

The CAMERA turns to the Buckingham Palace area where a large
quantity of gunmen mounted or not is gathered

JEFF
(shaking his head)
No good at all

He turns away from the screen but cant find the remote so he

cant switch off the TV

As the WOMAN keeps talking he puts his mask on the ground

then he looks for the wire and plug he finds them and unplugs

the set

Then he picks up his mask puts it back on manages to pick up

the set and carries it out of the room to the
KITCHEN

He manages to find the switch and to turn the light on then
he puts the TV set on the table

DAVID finally comes back and almost sees a stranger with a
mask on Until he hears his voice

JEFF
Stay here

He has to go back to the
LIVING ROOM
and gets his radio gear back
JEFF
(as he leaves the room)

Close this door and lock it for good

DAVID does it as JEFF re-enters the kitchen with his gear

INT KITCHEN — MORNING

The light is on the shutter still closed according to
instructions JEFF and DAVID are alone around the table

JEFF
I guess we need to talk

DAVID

your protection It was very careless

JEFF
Will he be all right

DAVID
(shaking his head)
I dont know
(pointing at the TV set)
Have you heard anything

JEFF
Yes that journalist gave her report
Its bad really bad The soldiers are
on the edge More of them are expected
from other cities and countries
but You know the more this is
getting serious the more Im wondering
if the infected have the ability to see
clearly in the dark

DAVID
You mean all their senses like
tenfold

JEFF
Not all but some better vision

Something like that What do you plan
to do About all this

DAVID
(shrugging with despair)
What would you do except try to protect
your kids from this I guess it all
depends on you

JEFF
Not on me I wont do a thing And
even if I wanted to I couldnt

I cant even contact my wife and
kid Theres no way for me to know
if theyre okay You know why I get
hosted by you and your family for
only one night and I see this

DAVID tries to stop him but the

DAVID
What do you think we should do

JEFF
Except wait until something good
comes up I dont see anything

We cant get out of the house we
cant even open a shutter its too
dangerous But I must try to contact
the army and tell them to burn any
dead body in sight

DAVID
I think they know it already

JEFF
But I dont believe they do it
properly I can bet that there still
are bodies lying in front and still
intact What about you any idea

DAVID
Your mates are probably looking for
me again

JEFF

Its a possibility

DAVID
Its more than a possibility But
they dont know where I live This
house is under my wifes name I mean
her maiden name Not mine And the
army doesnt have any file on me

JEFF
So they wont find you

DAVID
unless you call them about me

JEFF
I just told you

DAVID
I know Even if you wanted to
you wouldnt be able to

JEFF
I wouldnt help them anyway I saw
you losing your wife and almost
losing your eldest kid all this
within only a few hours I wont
add to it They will find you but
without my support

DAVID
And I guess not before some time

JEFF
(nods)
You should go take care of your
kids Ill set everything here

doorway he turns to JEFF

EXT STREETS AND SKY OF LONDON - DAY
An army helicopter flies over the city as some army jeeps and
police cars roll fast along the streets seeming to converge

to one point

The vehicles finally stop in front of

DAVIDS HOUSE
The helicopter stands by in the air

A whole lot of soldiers and policemen emerge from the
vehicles their guns pointed at the house but not only
Theres no word said loudly through a speaker or anything
else

There are gunshots and some infected drop in the distance

A POLICEMAN in his uniform finally walks to the entrance
alone He bangs on the door

The door opens and JEFF emerges In civilian clothes He
closes the door behind him

POLICEMAN
David Harkins
(as JEFF nods)
Youre under arrest I guess you know
what Im talking about

JEFF

He puts his hands in the air

POLICEMAN
Get on your knees
(JEFF gets down on his
knees)
Hands behind your head

JEFF puts his hands behind his head the policeman puts him
down to the ground and takes out a pair of handcuffs he uses
on JEFFs wrists As he does there are some more gunshots

POLICEMAN (contd)
Where are your wife and kids

JEFF
You dont need them Take me away
and lets get this over with

POLICEMAN
Good idea Better than the one you

He takes JEFF away pushes him inside one of the police cars
through the back all the men get back inside the vehicles who
leave the area with no delay hunted by some infected running
frantically So does the chopper

Back at the house another door opens The garage one
Wandas car is parked just in front

INT HELICOPTER — DAY

There are three soldiers inside the PILOT and the CO-PILOT in

family is expendable Over and out

he PILOT and the CO-PILOT look at each other stunned

4d

he helicopter turns around

Soon it gets back to where it was before facing the house
This time it turns 90 degrees so the gunman can face the house
and fire straight at it Then it stands by

The car is not in front of the houses garage door any more
ts gone Nobody inside the chopper notices

The guy pulls the trigger and the house gets riddled with
heavy bullets for about forty seconds

INT HOUSE

Every front shutter and window flies into pieces the bullets
and daylight break in the rooms destroying everything inside
as well as the entrance door everything

What used to be called Wanda is brutally hit a couple of more
times in the leg and abdomen and it roars with the pain
Another bullet hits its tied arm and braces setting it free

EXT HOUSE

The shooting finally stops three army vehicles show up and
stop by the destroyed house There is nobody no civilian
person coming out of any other house around

A whole unit of soldiers emerge some of the men enter the
house through the doorless entrance while the others look
around their guns pointed

INT HOUSE - HALLWAY

Its dark but smoky inside so the soldiers progress very
carefully as silently as they can

Some gunfire from the outside make them jump a bit but they
keep going

One of them finds the switch and turns on the light making
the others turn around to him in one go

ONE OF THE SOLDIERS
Fuck

They all catch their breaths and keep going

None of them can see the blood on the floor covered with dust
and pieces of concrete plaster and wood

One of them reaches the door leading to the kitchen opens it
quickly not going in his gun pointed two other guys behind
pass him and inspect the room - which is almost intact

The same one opens the door leading to the living room not
going in Three guys behind pass him and enter the room

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
None of them sees Wanda hidden under the big table Despite
her wounds she suddenly jumps from under and savagely bites

the first soldier in the throat

He yells like crazy they both fall down on the floor back in
the

HALLWAY

the creature on him biting deeper always more frantically

The soldiers are too surprised and shocked to react properly
at once The creature looks up at them they step back
despite its wounds in the legs it manages to half stand up
stopping in an incredibly threatening position and they all
fire Its thrown backwards riddled with bullets

They keep stepping back slowly as the bitten soldier convulses
on the floor and finally turns to them as he starts standing
up showing them a twisted face and blood red eyes

They fire again before he can attack
