FADE IN
ARCHIVE NEWS FOOTAGE VERY REAL AND AUTHENTIC

An AERIAL SHOT THROUGH THE LENS OF A TV NEWS CAMERA

of a structure a roadside motel sitting along a side
road surrounded by a vast empty brown wasteland The
image trembles the 0S RUMBLE OF HELICOPTER BLADES
WHIRLING

SEVERAL NEWS VANS POLICE CARS AND AMBULANCES are parked
around the motel PEOPLE mil about the scene

Behind the motel a BACK-HOE tears into the ground COPS
circle the back-hoe digging with shovels

NEWSCASTER (VO)
This is a live shot of the Prairie
View Motel in the eastern side of
McKinley County Weve been told
police have been working out here
for several hours but the details
were getting from them are sketchy
at best What we do know is that
theyve borrowed some equipment
from a local farmer and started
digging in the rear of the
property What theyre looking for
though were not exactly sure

The camera shot shakily zooms in on the back-hoe as the
machine drags its teeth out of the earth raises into the
air and a DIRT-COVERED CORPSE HANGS FROM THE METAL CLAW

The middle of the night in the middle of nowhere An endless
span of empty rolling hills dissected by a two-lane highway

a GLOW RISES OVER THE CREST the BMW zooms up the pavement
its lights blinding the animal

start

David leaps back startled He catches his breath as the
animal scurries away

DAVID (CONTD)
Goddamn raccoons are killing me
