OVER THE DARKNESS WE HEAR--

a strange throbbing sound

LIGHT

EXPLODES outwards from the center
BRILLIANT WHITE

RED and ORANGE BEAMS emerge
swirling into IRIDESCENT STREAMERS

They fuse into a TUNNEL OF LIGHT
that changes into BLAZING HOT GAS
a chromatic shimmering haze

This mutates into PRIMAL ENERGY
turbulent wavy blue-yellow light

Crackling TENDRILS OF ATOMIC ENERGY lash out -- ZZZWAKK
Pull Back to reveal that we were inside a STAR

having witnessed NUCLEAR FUSION the conversion of matter
into energy The possible source of life on earth

Traces of prismatic energy (GASEOUS PARTICLES) escape out
into

EXT SPACE - PRESENT DAY

»an infinite star field

We hitch a ride with the traveling Gaseous Particles and drop
downwardsthrough layers of RADIATION WAVES finally
revealing

EXT EARTH’S SKY (THE US) - 10000FT UP - NIGHT

Gaseous Particles push through the billowy clouds bringing

overlooking an expansive OPEN VALLEY

An inviting paradise found in east-central California
Barely visible HEADLIGHTS cut through the blackness below

-a GRAND CHEROKEE Moving fast and with urgency

GASEOUS PARTICLES

sprinkle across the ground near a GANG OF BISON grazing Up
ahead the Cherokee speeds towards a vast FOREST

EXT FOREST - LOG CABIN - LITTLE LATER

A CABIN ON A HILLSIDE
lights are on curtains are pulled
A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEM
on the roof flashes with activity

A LAND ROVER sits parked on an open rocky road

Cherokee’s HEADLIGHTS strobe through the trees
then disappear as the engine turns off
The SOUNDS OF NATURE fill the air

A SQUIRREL picks at an acorn Delighted with life

Two SILHOUETTED FIGURES creep out of the woodland
aman and a woman ORIS and ZARA respectively Both 30ish
smooth and military in movement

Hefting SUBMACHINE GUNS
The squirrel scampers away Startled

Two other HARD-CHARGING KILLERS hang back

ETHAN DALLAS 40’s shaggy beard conceals his otherwise
boyish face

ETHAN (ON SCREEN)
Well
(beat)
Did they agree to destroy Brain
Mapping

RHEA
They didnt commit either way

ETHAN (ON SCREEN)
Rhea

RHEA
What were you expecting Ethan
(snapping her fingers)
An immediate Yes Sure no problem

ETHAN (ON SCREEN)
Didnt you explain how dangerous Brain
Mapping is

RHEA
No Ethan I overlooked all that

ETHAN (ON SCREEN)
Damn it Rhea what did Porter and
Aldridge say

RHEA
That Brain Mapping could change
everything make everything better

She holds up an ELECTRONIC DEVICE to support the point
a circular-shaped computer chip

One side is smooth with FLASHING INDICATORS and an EMBEDDED
LENS a FASTENER encircles the edge The other displays its
complicated but cool-looking circuitry
This is the NEURO-CHIP

RHEA (CONTD)
-And in fairness Ethan they have a
point

ETHAN (ON SCREEN)
The neuro-chip is impressive Rhea
But it doesnt off-set the killer
dangers inherent in Brain Mapping

RHEA
I know But I didnt want to push them
-- okay Ethan The neuro-chip is
their life

ETHAN (ON SCREEN)
I understand that Rhea I do

RHEA
Theyre unveiling it to the world
tomorrow for Christs sake

ETHAN (ON SCREEN)
I can relate god knows But time

He checks the dead computer

She goes to search elsewhere when she doubles-back

Her gaze focuses on MOVING BLINDS by the window Rhea fled
through

EXT FORREST - CONTINUOUS

RHEA

rushes alongthrough SHAFTS OF MOONLIGHTzigs and zags
around TOWERING TREES

She stops panting
Twigs SNAP Approaching movement
Rhea hides behind a MASSIVE TREE

Two BODIES emerge from the shadows Spread out
It’s Reese and Lopez

REESE

prowls around STUN BATON ready ELECTRIC ARCS CRACKLE
It’s quiet Only the tranquil SOUNDS of nature

Without warning Rhea SMACKS AWAY the stun baton - CLAMPS onto
Reese’s throat - LIFTS HIM UP with one hand onto his tiptoes
- the neuro-chip is attached to her bicep FLASHING WITH
ACTIVITY

Tough-guy Reese struggles in vain to break free from his 60-
something assailant

RHEA
How does Solenko know I was
communicating with the FTF
REESE

Dunno We were just ordered on a
snatch-and-run

LOPEZ (0S)

Lopez stands across Submachine gun up

LOPEZ (CONT’D)
Before I put you down

RHEA
He’s all yours

RHEA FLINGS REESE THROUGH THE AIR - BODY-CRASHES INTO LOPEZ
Rhea flees
Lopez in a fit of snarling rage aims her submachine gun
REESE
(spluttering)

She has to be alive
Lopez RIPS OFF A BURST
ROUNDS RAKE THROUGH THE TREES as Rhea ducks and pushes
through a MASS OF LEAVES - then like that -- she drops out of
sight --

slides down a MUDDY CLIFF in a blur of rapid motion - lands
SPLAT in a marsh

Dazed muddy and gasping she’s now sprawled along --
A CANYON

overlooking a wide lake Surrounded by awesome CLIFFS and a
WATERFALL shimmering silver in the moonlight

She rises weakly - stumbles back down COUGHS and SPLUTTERS
Spots the neuro-chip spurting on and off Malfunctioning

ZARA (OFF)
Give ya a hand there doc

Rhea looks up - the BUTT of Zara’s submachine gun goes to
WHACK her - when RHEA’S HAND CLAMPS HOLD - the neuro-chip
indicators flashing at half-speed

Still Zara can’t free her gun

RHEA FLINGS THEM BOTH ACROSS THE MUD

She picks herself up Only to see Oris straight ahead
aiming a taser gun - FIRES --

Rhea drops AAAAAAGHH

Struggles to resist her body writhes in agony
ORIS
Youre done Dr Piper Don’t make us
go enhanced on your tired ass
Rhea slumps Out cold HEAVY WIND blows through

Zara approaches Stretching out the pain Reese and Lopez
stand over the edge of the cliff looking down

The neuro-chip powers down
SMASH TO

Even if Solenko or Eternity Connection
never existed nothing would change we
would still be out here

NICK
How do you work that out

ETHAN
What do you think science is

NICK
Being able to build cool stuff

ETHAN
(warming to Nick)
Fair enough But thats your take on
things For others science is another
story

NICK
About what

ETHAN
Discovering the correct mechanical laws
and equations that will decipher the
mind of God

NICK
Great another born-again scientist
Just what the mix needs

ETHAN
Think about it for a second Think
about every major modern scientific
accomplishment space exploration DNA
decoding - the scientists involved were
all religiously-motivated

NICK
Religiously-motivated

ETHAN
God isnt dead Nick Scientists since
Ancient Greece have been doing their
damndest to reboot the promise of
everlasting peace Science is a
spiritual process a process Nick
thats seeking to reconnect mortals
with the source redeem our divinity

Nanobots Youre talking about
nanobots -- manufacturing systems
assemblers

ETHAN

(nodding yes)
Miniscule robots that can modify the
DNA code and reprogram consciousness
into energy and then meld that energy
into space an infinite system of

First you have to understand

themselves on the ledge
