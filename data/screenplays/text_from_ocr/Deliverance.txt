EXT DAM PROJECT (HELICOPTER) DAY

A long high view of a gap between two mountains which is
gradually being dammed An endless convoy of trucks winds’
up a temporary road to the dam each tips its load of rock
and rubble then turns down again A deep wooded valley
is slowly being walled-up

At the base of the dam a silver thread of river still escapes
through an open sluice-gate A huge billboard proclaims

The Cahulawassee Dam Project and shows an artists in-
pression of the finished Dam and an idyllic lake behind it

MAIN TITLES BEGIN

EXT CAHULAWASSEE RIVER DAY

Follow the river up stream from the dam through tall secret
woods and naked rock faces up the white water of angry
rapids across still deep pools and finally to a road
bridge where a decrepit small Southern town straddles its
banks Move in closer to a clump of trees by the riverside
and on through the trees to reveal an old cemetary where

Men are digging up graves disinterring the dead Rotting

coffins are piled on to a truck catafalques are broken
asunder head stones piled up in neat stacks like sliced
bread

TITLES CONCLUDE

EXT FIELD ARCHERY RANGE DUSK

The face of ED GENTRY in profile an indoor-desk man in
early middle-age flesh a little soft He is wearing a
bushhat and shooting arrows The bow string appears crawn
back and pressed into the cheek by the fingers of his right
hand

The arrow lies across his face the feathers rasping against
the bristles of his jowl His eye lines up behind a curious
orange peephole in the bow-string far-focusing The nice
open suburban American face contorts in the act of con-
centration becoming animal and a little frightening

Then the fingers relax and the arrow is simply no longer
there The face falls back to what it was

LEWIS MEDLOCKs head comes into view alongside and just
behind EDs He glances off at the unseen target and then
at ED LEWIS has a powerful ascetic face with bright alert
eyes that might be just a little manic

3 (Cont)
LEWIS
A little high Eleven oclock

ED draws another arrow his face again transfigured by the
power of full draw Still the target is unseen only the
faces of the two men visible

He stays a long time at full-draw He starts to shake and
the arrow rips away flying cut of the bow ED curses

ED
Why does that happen Lewis

LEWIS
It happens

LEWIS takes EDs place knocking an arrow ED shakes his
head disguated

LEWIS
Draw hysteria You either conquer
it and make it work for you or it
destroys you as-an archer

LEWIS draws holding the bow high and bringing it down on
Cs to the target revealing a glimpse of an awesome bicep
7) He is confident calm mystical EDs look is amused
affectionate but definitely impressed

LEWIS shoots an arrow beautifully rhythmically with a
perfect tranquil follow-through

He finishes and the TWO MEN walk towards ths target re-
vealing themselves fully for the first time also the range
Field archery is something iike golf a series of targets

at different distances set amongst trees and brush This
one has been artifically developed on wasteland in the

eity itself It is a little patch of wild woods hemmed in
on one side by an elevated freeway on the others by
railway sidings and indeterminate industrial buildings

The targets are pinned to baies of straw and this one is

in the shape of a paper deer They examine their shots

and puli out the arrows The paper deer and the city
looming over them makes the archery seem very tame a faint
echo of what it once meant to hunters and warriors

LEWIS straightens up as though suddeniy aware of this
looking round at the range with some contempt his power-
ful chest framed against the freeway

LEWIS
(Antoning it)
The Cahulawassee River Wait till
you see it Ed I tell you its
wild and beautiful

He speaks softly his voice hypnotic He looks off into
the distance as though he can see the river and ED follows
his eyeline towards the city that is lighting up for the
night

LEWIS
When you get that white water under
you things change and all of this
is washed away

Then breaking off moving away he says mockingly over his
shoulder

LEWIS
And theyve got deer up there Ed
and theyre made of meat instead
of paper

ED follows him laughing

INT EXT RESTAURANT BAR ATLANTA DAY

LEWIS and ED have been lunching or drinking beer with two
other men BOBBY and DREW All four are in their late
thirties or early forties

They wear lightweight’ business suits all but LEWIS who
has on an expensive sports shirt

They are milling around the cash desk paying the tab
talking and laughing

BOBBY
But we know nothing about canoeing
Lewis

They spill out of the door -

LEWIS
(plausible and
persuasive)
Theres nothing to it We leave
Friday morning at first light and
well be back on Sunday in time to
catch the last half of the TV pro game

S EXT ARCADE DAY

They amble with ths srowd dlong a sunken arcade The city
roads and sidewalks cross above them

BCBBY
eooe but shooting ranids

LEWIS
Sure It’s the second best sen-
sation in the world

They start up 4 spirai of steps up to street level The
impression is of rivers of pecpie flowing above them
below them around them

DREW
(poking fun at Lewis)
The Vanishing Wilderness huh

LEWIS
(relentleas)
This is When the dam at Aintry is
finished the water1l back up and
the rivers going to disappear for
ever Its our last chance to see it

6 EXT PEACHTREE STREET ATLANTA DAY

They bob up into the biazing sun The black glass cir-
cular tower of the Regensy Hyatt House Hotel dominates

the street Drab typists and flabby business men thread
their way back to the office biccks cver the hot sidewaiks
The street is snarled-with traffic choked with exhaust
fumes Up the street there nas been a minor accident

DREW
(the stifling crowd
deciding him)
Hell lets take it then

BOBBY
Why not

ED watcnes all this the dead fases ef the crowds the moan
of the traffics LEWIS suz king them all into hig scheme
He is evidentiy oppressed by it but does nothing about it
too lethargis perhaps His eye mcves to the black glass
tower the city reflected and gramented in its facets

° BOBBY Yeah Lewis some of us have to
work for a living
Te INT EDS OFFICE DAY

It is modern tasteful There are some very good action
portraits of his wife and son on the wall with one or two
framed art director awards His desk is strewn with roughs
drawings samples of lettering half-finished comps and
prominently layouts for an ad for Kitt ‘n Britches It

is a drawing of a girl in nothing but panties holding a
kitten and looking back over her shoulder

ED looks at none of this but stands motionless lethargis
at the enormous window that makes up the cuter wall He
is staring at the same round black tower which is much
closer now just across the street It throws back its
broken kaleidoscopic view of the city

The phone rings Without moving his eyes from the tower
he answers it

ED
Youre all ready back there
Itll be down in a second

He puts down the ‘phone takes a deep breath exhales it
sharply and goes out of his door carrying the Kitt tn
Britches layouts

INT ADVERTISING STUDIO DAY

ED comes out of his private office and walks down the length
of a large open-bay studio where some of the commercial
artists are working or laughing or talking

ED assumes the alr of dynamic executive and his employees
smile or nod to him familiarly but get back to their work
too ED enters a door at the end of the room

INT PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO DAY

The model in a black and white checked rcbe is sitting

in a camp chair An oider woman obviously an employee is
holding a kitten Two or three men are bustiing about under
the lights They clear away newspapers from the place where
the model will stand to be photographed They are “‘incredibiy
serious and intense as only men doing something fundamentally
trivial can be

(

9 (Cont)
‘ The model stands on ths chalk marks and a girl assistant
CO takes her robe

The model is revealed wearing only the Kitt n Britches
EDs mouth opens and he sucks in breath There is a

tmy God look in his face She is brown and freckled
shapely but muscular but above ail fresh a country girl

Her arms are folded across her tare treasts The woman
hands her the kitten She takes it in one hand and to
protect herself simply holds her left breast in her hand
in a beautiful gesture At the same time she turns and
eatches EDs look recognising the homage it pays her

She smiles at him not a simpering or coquettish lock but
in a simple act of private giving

ED stretches out an arm and touches her shoulder with his
finger tips
10 INT EDS BEDROOM DAWN

His wife MARTHA lies with her back facing ED He stretches
out his hand and touches her shoulder in exactly the same

spot as he did the model girl It might even be the model
girl at this point MARTHA responds by turning towards him
awe) with a movement that is entirely habitual She has her

head wrapped in a kind of tewel the sort of protective
covering that sufferers from sinusitis wear She dees not
open her eyes even when she speaks They are both very
still There is a faint tinkie as of Chinese windebells

MARTHA
Are you really going
ED
I think so
MARTHA
Gan I do anything
ED

Just one thing
Her eyes open
MARTHA

ED
Why don’t you turn over this time

She is on her side facing him She looks at him trying
to read him but he shuts her out She pulis a pillow
down to her pelvis then turns slowly on to it burying
her facein the bed

ED crawls to her and over her looking down at her back

FLASH CUT

The MODEL GIRL turns smiling taking her breast in her
hand

INT EDS LIVING ROOM DAY

LEWIS ready for the woods stands framed in the open back
door He looks in grinning a little crazily At first -
it seems he might be watching ED and MARTHA in bed but
then ED appears dressed with his bow in his hand knife
and rope on his belt

LEWIS
(softly)
The sun’s coming up Up north the
waters running

EXT EDS BACKYARD DAY

A iong curved aluminum canoe lies across the top of
LEWIS stationwagon blending into it in the early mcerning
half-light transforming the familiar car-shaps ED and
LEWIS ciimb in

The back of the car is packed with equipment tents and so
on mostly in various shades of green The sar backs cut
inte the deserted suburban street leaving MARTHA and DEAN
Eds son huddled together waving

EXT HIGHWAY DAY

The cars with canoes on their-tops drive through the ugly
clutter of the outskirts of the city past drive-ins
motels shopping centers filling stations The morning
traffic is going into the city as they head out

INT LEWIS CAR a DAY

LEWIS is driving He holds the wheel at the top with
his hands crossed and his arms at full stretch tensing
him against the seat

LEWIS
eevee the human body Thats the

one thing you cant fake No

ED
Go ahead Crucify yourself
lifting weights Im committed
to the machine And America

Outside on the highway the billboards the electric
pylons stride across the countryside proclaiming their
dominance

LEWIS
We took the wrong road Its a
blind alley believe me It cant
last It cant support its own
weight

ED
Listen Lewis it will last as
long as we believe it will last
When enough guys like you stop
believing in it then it will
collapse Its a matter of faith

LEWIS

ED has had enough He sinks back in his seat

i ED
Listen I like my life

LEWIS
I know what it does to you Ed

ED looks at him sharply

LEWIS
City life is killing you
(and he pauses for effect)
Ne Its boring you to death Youre

LEWIS pauses looking steadily at the road

LEWIS

ED starts up and looks cut into the woods where LEWIS points
But too late Hse smiles pleasurably at the sight of the
mountains

ED
The Wilderness

INT CAR DAY

They go over a narrow bridge the kind made from concrete
sections in the thirties ED leans out of the window
looking curiously at the river The river seems placid and
narrow undistinguished rather uninteresting

ED
That it
LEWIS
Thats it
ED turns back to the river to conceal his disappointment from
‘LEWIS
EXT ORES DAY

The two cars pull into Oree It is a disheartening place

a typical remote small southern town The woods and weed-
fields seem to grow right up to the edge of it There are

no Negroes in evidence for this is on the hills and there
is no precedent There is a town hall the fire engine being
washed near it a couple of gas atations Graffit is
scrawled on a wall ‘STOP THEM DROWNING OUR LAND’ There are
several deserted and boarded up houses

EXT GAS STATION DAY

LEWISs car and the other pull into a Texaco station LEWIS
pulls to a atop and kills the engine For a moment nothing
happens Then an OLD MAN appears at the window of the car

at LEWISs side leaning in He is almost ridiculous country
aimost like a caricature with an absurdly eccked straw hat
and trembling hands Neither LEWIS nor ED knows quite what to
do with him

LEWIS
Look ist me ask you something

OLD MAN
You from the television

21 (Cont)

LEWIS
Television
OLD MAN
About the Dan

LEWIS

No Can you find us somebody to
drive these two cars down o
Aintry

OLD MAN
What are you talking about

LEWIS
(giving up and turning
to Ed)
Oh shiz
(then to the old man)
Fill ‘em up will you

‘The OLD MAN takes the hose and with some clattering pushes
it into DREWs car They get out and stretch their limbs

and sniff the alien air LEWIS spreads out his map on the
hood and bends over it The OLD MAN finds himself staring
through the cars back window at DREWs guitar He jerks

his head back over his shoulder

OLD MAN
Which a you plays guitar

DREW looks over to him with a smile and a deprecatory shrugo

OLD AN
Lonnie Come con out ‘cnere

DREW crosses to the OLD MAN and then follows his look back
into the dark depths of the Texaco station The others
having nothing stronger to focus their attention turn to
leok-as a shy ALBINO BOY sidles out of the gloomy interior
cradling a battered fiveestring banjo

THE MEN suffer the acute discomfort of suburban dwellers
when confronted with tne unseemly The BOY’s white skin
looks luminous in the shadows The OLD MAN laughs softly
with pride and affection for THE BOY tut also because he °
feels that the advantegs has shifted away from the CITY MEN
LONNIE saquints against the lights He is probably a half-wit
likely from a family inbred ta the point of imbecility and
Albinism He smiies sweetly expectantly threugh his squint
The OLD MAN looks up at DREW whe is rights by him and speaks
softly in his ear

(

ei OLD MAN

( ‘ Coms on Mister Play us a
little something

DREW looks over to the others for guidance especially
to LEWIS but they avoid his eyes thoroughly confused
LEWIS turns abruptly and felds his map noisily

DREW winds down the bacx windew and takes out the guitar
LONNIE follows DREW ciczely holding the banjo in whatever
position DREW assumes with his guitar His cross eyes are
evident and rather endearing He is innocent and ready
DREW smiles at him starts to tunes his guitar setting his
finger picks LONNIE follows him dragging a homemade
capo up the neck of his banjo

DREW
gentiy softiy)
What are we going to play Lonnis

Ths OLD MAN is moving acrosso LEWISs car juddering the
hose into the tank with his trembiing-hands

OLD MAN
(laughing and shouting)
Anything Play anything

DREW looks around again not quite sure as to whether or

not he is going to contribute to a painful situation Than
he makes up his mind crossés ons leg over the cther as he
sits on the car hood and very carefully picks three notes in
the key of C

(These are the first notes of a piece calied Duelling Banjces

- -as recorded by Mike Russo and Ress Brentano in Fertiand
Oregon in 196 The piess is one in which guitar and
banjo answer each other by playing the same phrases
alternately)

The OLD MAN filling the tank leans close to LEWIS who
pulls away from him

OLD MAN
Lonnie dsnt know anything but banjo-
picking He ain’t never been t2
school

DREW dives into the piece figuring as one would suppose
that he will go ahead and play the piece whether LONNIE
joins him or not The OLD MAN watches with a sly knowing
e grin waiting LEWIS moves across breaxing the OLD MAN’s
eyeline

21 (Cont2)

LEWIS
What about drivers Where can
we find drivers

The OLD MAN moves past LEWIS putting the hose back on the
pump LEWIS follows him again interrupting his view but
the OLD MAN just leans this way or that restoring his view
of DREW and LONNIE over the mountain ranges of LEWISs
muscles

OLD MAN
(shrugs) -
You might try the Griner boys
north of town They might do it

LEWIS having got what he wanted turns away to his ceaseless
map-reading

BOBBY and ED watch the ALBINO BOY with growing fascination

BOBBY

(whispers)
How is it these pecple up here are
always missing something a finger
an eye an arm or in the head I
never saw a farmer yet who didnt hava
something wrong with him Youd think
it would be a healthy life

As if to prove his point THREE or FOUR WEIRD LOOKING
HILLBILLIES have materialised out of the weeds to stand

at the edge of the concrete apron aware of an approaching
event

This ILL-ASSORTED GROUP clusters around thess TWO MUSICIANS
in a dusty forgotten or never-discovered filling station
way off up in the mountains of Appalachia

ED
Why lcok at Drew - a suburban hedge-
clipper up here doing this

DREW has finished the sequence cf chords that comprise the
piece and starts at the beginning again

is time the sound is different For every phrase he plays
there is an echo He does not look up from the guitar key-
board but his face and attitude change first te gratified
unbelief and then to full conviction The banjo comes on
stronger perfectly answering each of his chords The musi
begins to sound good to sound driving and confident and
gutsy to catch the oniookers in its sweep and suck them into

- (

21 (Cont3) ‘
its vortex It becomes a special rare experience and even
‘LEWIS is heid by it

DREW is alternately finger-picking and flatepicking with the
thumb He goes faster and the boy goes right with him

LONNIEs scratched child’s hands move with beautiful musical
economy His face has the beatific vision of the idiot doing
what he loves

They play one more chorus the loudest and best of all and
daring this DREW moves off the car to LONNIE’s side and they
stand together listening closely to each other finishing
well riding together

DREW
God damn

DREW stands upright overwhelmed totally happy The others
are on the point of applause and it erupts net in slapping
but in laughter

DREW
God damn I could play all day
Q with that guy

vé The OLD MAN is laughing hard with a strange stiff bending
at movement from the waist and a look of ‘I told you’ on his
face DREW the big-faced decent city man goes forward to
shake hands with the demented country boy but the decor
has closed There is no way in except through the music He
wags the BOY’s limp hand The OLD MAN slaps DREW’s back
like a man who has just told a joke racked with mirth

’ OLD MAN
Whatd I tell you
22 INT CAR DAY

ED is still happy from the music but LEWIS is hunched
ferward his hands crossed on the wheel leaning on ths car

LEWIS
Weve got to get water under us

Oree hes patered out inte an occasional straggiy building
LEWIS spcts a dilapidated garage ahead on the road There
is a rough wooden house attached to it and a sign reading

EXT GRINERS GARAGE DAY

The whole place is almost drowning in the trees and weeds
around it LEWIS leaps out of the car and knocks impatiently
on the door of the house which is half-open ED climbs out
and dutifully joins him but BOBBY and DREW remain in their
car laughing soundlessly behind their windshield

Through the open door a sliver of the house is visible a
picture of Jesus a few beercans on the floor and in the
deep shadows of the room an old woman is just visible in
silouette A strange trick of light illuminates one of her
eyes The eye and its pouch of aged skin seems to hang in-
dependently in space unconnected to a body

OLD WOMAN
Curse you Leave us be Blust your
eyes

“This seems to be what she is saying although in fact her
speech is so country and slurred that the words are hard
to make out

ED
Jesus

LEWIS shrugs it off There is the sound of muffled hammer-
ing from the garage at the side of the house

LEWIS
(pointing towards the
garage
Sounds like hes in there

They move to the front door of the garage but it is
padlocked

LEWIS quickly threads a way to the rear of the garage through
a depressing wasteland of rusted farm implements twisted
cars abandoned pistonless engines

At the back of the garage they find a door sagging open
The sound of metal is mich louder as it comes through the
opening

Without any hesitation at all LEWIS plunges into the dark-
ness of the garage He is gone before ED makes up his mind
to follow him but he does and goes in toc For a moment
there is nothing but the junky back of the garage and the

sound of metal being pounded

INT GRINERS GARAGE ‘ - DAY

it is quite dark at first but soon objects smerge mysteri-
ously a luminous green truck battery cables and wires a
distributor and carburetor on a wooden bench an anvil an
engine hoisted and dangling on a heavy greasy chain Through
all these things LEWIS and ED thread their way and before
them is disclosed a huge country figure a kind of red-
necked Thor pounding the rim of a truck wheel laid on its
side on a bench

Just as the figure is established in its half-light an ex-
clamation comes from it

GRINER
Shit fire God Almighty

GRINERs figure bends apparently injured doubles up and
makes for the door

ED immediataly presses himself into the wall to allow the
agonised creature to pass into the light but LEWIS his
powerful body silhouetted against the white light spilling
through the door seems to block GRINER’s way His position
forces GRINER to look up at him LEWIS having exacted this
penance turns elegant as a matador letting the huge bull
man pass LEWIS has just the glint of a smile the look of

the competitive compulsive games player

EXT REAR OF GARAGE DAY

GRINER stands in the yard spraddled-legged hoiding his

hurt hand He looks up at LEWIS and ED and it is impossible
to tell as to whether the intenss terrible fierceness in his
face is coming from his pain or from their intrusion
Probably it is from both He is an enormous country brutal
looking man with no humor in him He suggests nothing but
brutality and stupidity And enormous physical power He

is dressed in overall pants and a sleeveless undershirt a
train engineer’s cap and army boots which are blackened
with grease and unlaced

LEWIS walks right up to him

LEWIS
Can we do anything

GRINER
as though this were a perfectly
logical question he rejects)
Naw It aint as bad as I thoughs

GRINER pulls out a dirty handkerchief and wraps it around
his hand

(firmly)
Because its there

This is for ED and LEWIS throws him a look
GRINER
Its thereall right If you git

The situation is suddenly dangerous and out of hand
ED glances at them both anxiously
ED

Listen Lewis To hell with it

Lets go back to town and play

LEWIS pays no attention to ED but grinds GRINER with his
eyes

LEWIS moves directly up to GRINER in what is quite obviously
a challenge to GRINER to do something physical if hes of
a mind to

ED pulls at LEWISs arm

ED

some others

GRINER takes the bills and stuffs them in his pocket He ‘
‘melts into the rear of the house Lewis gives ED a quick
grin
LEWIS and ED move around the garage back to the car
ED
(lowers his voice)
You reckon well ever see these cars
again’ This is a rough son-of-a-bitch
ee) As they come round to the front of the garage DREW and

BOBBY appear noving tentatively towards them

DREW
You in some kind of trouble

LEWIS thrusts through them towards his car dismissing their
nervousness

LEWIS
Its all fixed

The others follow LEWIS and hang about him uncertainly by
his car

BOBBY
We heard this cussing and shouting

LEWIS
Its OK

BOBBY is about to go on but looks up and stops The others
also become circumspect and in the foreground the huge arms
and chests of the GRINER BROTHERS cross towards their run-
down pick-up truck followed by the eyes of the city men

The pick-up truck pulls out and in the cab besides the
BROTHERS there is quite definitely a THIRD MAN His
features are in shadow there is just a suggestion of a
figure in a baseball cap - and nothing more

EXT ROAD ABOVE OREE mo DAY

LEWISS car accelerates out in front of the truck with tyres
erying out DREW is content to tag along behind

INT LEWISS CAR DAY

ED
Better let them show us

LEWIS
(scornfully)
Hell we know ‘bout where it is

Just ahead LEWTS sees a suggestion of a dirt road going off
to the left He slews She car round on to it The car

jaws end bumps badiy ED tries not to look avprehensive
without quite succeeding

LEWIS bumps and bangs down into a kind of hollow where the
road gives out

Nothing is there but the rock-chimney of a burned down house

Pi ) -LEWIS
Well we screwed up sure enough

ED
Why not just let them show us
where the river is

LEWIS
Youtre missing the whole point Ed

He hurls the car around on full lock and claws back to the
road where the truck and the other car wait As LEWIS
comes alongside the pick-up GRINER leans out of his ceb

GRINER
Where yougoin city boy

LEWIS
Well get there

GRINER

river in the State

ED hides a kind of smile but LEWIS is undaunted not angry
n or rattled at all He spurts forward again the canoe
( rattling and banging on the roof

The lend is flatter and the road runs between stumps of
pine trees LEWIS gestures at the stumps

LEWIS
Lands been sawmilled Map shows
an old logging road

28 EXT TRACK TO RIVER DAY

A track leads off into it LEWIS drives in without slacken-
ing speed The track immediately clips down a steep incline
The road obviously doubles as a river bed at flood-time its
surface gouged out and at the seme time smoothed over

ED braces himself against the dashboard Bushes swirl at
the open windows of the car flying in then whipping out
again The underside of the car drags and crunches on brush
and gravel

Suddenly the car is stopped and the branches become still
Ea lying across EDS chest

CO ) LEWIS
Listen

They keep perfectly still for a moment swallowed in the
dark green belly of the forest

Unmistakably the sound of running water

LEWIS grins and his grin widens eas the sound seems to grow
LEWIS is himself again

LEWIS
You have to get lost before you
can find it

They clamber out LEWIS leaping ED rather apprehensively

ED
You reckon there are any snakes
around here

LEWIS
Plenty Watch where you put your

(oe feet

Fe ED catches a glimpse of himself in the rear window of the
station wagon where the dark equipment inside makes the
window more like a mirror He buckles on his Army web
belt with the big knife on it and the coil of green nylon
rope

He pulls a wry face at himself which is meant to self-
mocking as though he were putting himself on by acting this
way wearing these clothes being here in the woods

ED looks around for LEWIS and doesnt find him He looks
in this direction then that Finally he sees LEWIS momen-
tarily further down the slope

ED scrambles after him - squeamishly as though afraid of
getting his tennis shoes dirty he crowhops dodging the

pools of water over to where LEWYIS is peering at something
through a drapery of bushes and willows

29 EXT THE RIVER DAY
ED comes up to LEWIS and LEWIS dramatically opens the
willows wider revealing a leaf-framed view of the river
Ce The sound swells up
oo The river is pretty beautiful even - but not as wide as one

might have thought it would be It is green and clean and
not threatening at all

LEWIS
There it is The real thing

ED
Pretty Pretty indeed

The willows swish back into place closing off the view of
the stream

EXT EMBARKATION POINT DAY

BOBBY and LEWIS havé the aluminium canoe on their backs
and stagger down to the water leaves lashing this four-
legged headless beast

THE GRINERS watch from their truck with derisive fascination
making no attempt to help

BOBBY and LEWIS lift the canoe down awkwardly into the water
where ED takes it from them The other canoe the green
wooded one is floating and loaded up already ED holds the
canoe and is pushed deeper into the water nearly to his
waist He pulls his way back but the mud holds him

ED
Its got me

LEWIS
Whats got you

ED
Tt

LEWIS grins anc turns back to loading and fussing with the
gear as DREW gingerly hands down his guitar to ED

DREW

(imitating the country

talk in an exaggerated

way)
Im a goin with you and not with Mr
Lewis Medlock I done seen how he
drove these roads he dont know nothin
about

The gear is loaded now the tents the beer the food the
bedrolis the bows and arrows

LEWIS and BOBBY climb into the other canoe wearing their
life jackets BOBBY is incredibly awkward LEWIS easy
and competent

LEWIS
OK Were ready
Deep in the woods the sound of a car starting
BOBBY
Ill bet they cant get the cars
back up that hill

DREW and ED are strapping on their life-jackets

DREW
Thats a nice thought

BOBBY picks up his paddle gingerly and throws a somewhat
desperate look over his shoulder as LEWIS pushes away from

the bank
BOBBY
What the hell are we going to do
if we come off this river and
theres no cars down at whatts-its-
name
vf LEWIS
MW “Theyllbe there Dont worry about
a thing

LEWIS drives the canoe out with long sweeps while BOBBY
holds his paddle uncertainly

31 EXT THE RIVER DAY

DREW and ED settle in awkwardly and push off DREW picks
up his paddle and looks at it uncertainly He makes a
practise stroke through the air

DREW
This how you hold this thing

ED struggling himself alternately paddling and pushing at
the mud

ED
You hold it like you hold it

The water is fairly placid and slow here but moving just
© the same They feel the river take hold of the canoes take
them over Just the sound of the water Trees hang over the
to river holding back the sun turning the water inky

NS

LEWIS and BOBBY have got ahead while ED and DREW shift

31 (Cont)
CX about and experiment with their paddles laughing at their

awkwardness just like suburban fathers on a boating lake
in the park

EXT GENTLE RAPIDS DAY

The water quickens a little and the speed of the cance
visibly picks up So far ED and DREW are doing all right
and they begin to know it They are getting a rudimentary
sense of what they need to do

ED
Try a stronger pull I think were
getting the hang of it

A broader expanse of the river opens in front of them The
other canoe is still well ahead The river is not particu-
larly rough here but the part before them is a little
rougher than at the place where they put in

ED and DREW manoeuvre through some lively interesting but
not dangerous water none of it white but urgent and
vigorous

Then they’ run one little stretch that is very slightly
dangerous where the water begins to foam up and they make
it nicely

DREW turns backward to ED as much as he is able to do

DREW
Hey hey How about this

(pleased)
This is some kind of all right
huh

They go along in calmer water now ED ploughs easily along
enjoying things

DREW
Well for gods sake Whats
wrong up there Tarzan

Way ahead the other canoe is swung broadside to the current
The action of LEWIS and BOBBY in the other canoe is con-
fused and even a little desperate The canoe is turning all
the way around and begins to travel downstream backward

DREW turns around again only so much as he is able to in
his position and he is laughing sincerely and sympathetical-

Ed is more concerned about the others but he smiles too and
shakes his head ruefully as though he expected this

They are catching up with the green canoe as LEWIS tries to
bring the bow around

LEWIS
(to Bobby anu a
little impatiently)
Let me do it Take your paddle out
of the water and Ill bring it
around

He doesnt though Just as the bow is beginning to swing

downstrream they drift on to a couple of big rocks and hang
there LEWIS hunches in his seat trying to get the canoe
off the rocks that way doesnt succeed then steps out into
the water which comes up to his thigh He rights the canoe
by brute force just as ED and DREW come alongside They
move into the lead and LEWIS clambers back in and sets off
again

EXT OREE BRIDGE DAY

As they pass under the bridge one or two PEOPLE look down
at them watching impassively DREW spots the ALBINO BOY
amongst them He waves up enthusiastically and getting no
answer from THE BOY holds his paddle like a guitar and
pretends to play it THE BOY stares but makes no response

They pass under the bridge DREW turns and looks back THE
BOY has crossed over and still watches them from the other
side of the bridge

DREW
Spooky kid

They move through the part of the river lying directly under -
the town of Oree It is evidently used as a kind of junk
heap where thé townspeople throw away anything they dont
wante

The river bed is littered with old tires engines wheels
old refrigerators cookers and so on There are also several
startlingly bright broxen things of plastic pitchers water-

- containers and the like ED looks down at an electric blue

plastic jar that catches the late afternoon sun and shoots
up a jarring artificial light

ED looks around something is making him uneasy without
his knowing what it is

He brings his paddle out of the water and there is a feather
stuck to the end of it

23 33 (Cont )
C) ED peers intently at something in the river He cant quite
make it out but finally he does It is a chicken head
ludicrous and repulsive spinning aimlessly in the water be-
side the canoe turning over and over fixing ED every now
and then with its open eye

ED still gazes into the river while he paddles The canoe
passes Over a huge ghostly white underwater thing

It is a big rock with a log wedged against it Both rock and
log are covered with feathers wavering hairy and repul-
sive in a sort of uncanny representation of human nausea a
perfect image of this

DREW

Geu-u-ghi

along not worried
about a thing)

Man you got to get used to these
Cc things Youre a big boy now

ED

You get used to ‘em

A little further down to make things worse an effluent pipe
issues into the river’ and soon they are riding on a river of
blood chicken blood

ED
(not able to contain
“his disgust)
Je-sus

well as he can in

manner which is

that of joking

but not entirely)

EXT STRETCH OF RAPIDS ‘ DAY

They go around a turn and the river changes completely
There is a long series of little rapids lively and interest-
ing looking stretching out of sight ahead

DREW
Well for the Lords sake would you
look at that What do we do now

They are delighted but apprehensive too

ED
Lewis says head right for the fastest
water Try to keep us going right down
the middle through the channel and be-
tween the rocks Thats all I know to do

oe “DREW
Ay ay Lets go there

DREW digs in enthusiastically the canoe picks up speed and
starts through the first of the rapids

They are sucked in to battle with the river trying to keep
the canoe straight in the channel trying to avoid running
over rocks

During all this ED is silent working hard but now end then
DREW gives an exultant whoop like a cowboy breaking a horse

There is just the right mixture of exhilaration and danger
DREW and ED are equal to coping with this stretch of the
river but only just barely There is a time when they just

‘about capsize They ship some water and DREW calls out Uh-

oh But somehow they right the canoe and continue At the last
place on this stretch they go right over a big boulder and
come down on the river with a tremendous WHUMP

The rapids give way to calmer water DREW and ED adjust them-
selves in their seats and re-arrange the equipment which has -
been shaken loose and out of place

DREW
‘Old Lewis by damn He knows something
ED
That was some ride eh
DREW
You better believe it was some ride
You 0K
ED

Pretty good Yes sir Sure ami

They back paddle and swing around to get a view of LEWIS and
BOBBY careering through the rapids They do pretty well too

oa strokes He has taken it in a very blase way but BOBBY is
honestly excited and thrilled
BOBBY
Wow Its better than Disneyland
DREW

Dont you think we ought to make camp
pretty soon

LEWIS
Yeah I do Im afraid if we go any
farther the banks might begin to get

35 EXT CAMP SITS NIGHT

It is now very dark and a couple of flashlights have been

hung in a bush so as to provide an area of concentrated light

Can This device renders various effects of light and dark and

lon) mood and tone as one after the other of the men passes

oo through this lit-up area stays in it for a moment then
melts back into the general dark

The upcast light of the flashlights gives unexpected quali-

ties to the faces of these men It makes BOBBY look vaguely

Oriental and DREWS face more pitted as the shadow adheres
to his face Only LEWIS is instantly recognizable though
changed somewhat too He looks more determined and author-

ative than ever with also an admixture of ruthlessness that

does not show up so well by daylight

There is no sound during this except single notes picked out

on DREWS guitar

DREW is now tuning his guitar in earnest using both the

regular method and also harmonic tuning which gives a beau-

tiful bell-like sound

BOBBY comes over to them and hands them a paper cup apiece
and then pours a big drink of bourbon for each He disap-
pears and LEWIS takes a generous swallow as ED sips then
LEWIS moves to the fire and begins to encourage it Steaks
are frying The fire nicks up and casts its flickering
Cc insubstantial light over the scene

35 (Cont )
ED goes and Lies on the bank by himself while LEWIS cooks
DREW plays a soft chord a minor

DREW
Ive always wanted to do this only
I didnt know it

He picks part of a very country-sounding blue-grass piece
then breaks off

DREW
Its woods music Dont you think so

ED
Sure do

He plays on switching around fragments of blues and blue-
grass then a few chords of Duelling Banjoes He leaves
gaps for the banjo to answer looking out into the woods but
none comes During the music BOBBY pours himself another
drink and ED one He offers the bottle to DREW but DREW
shakes his headbeing happy with his music and wanting
nothing else nothing to interfere with it

LEWIS brings over dishes of the food he has cooked and the
three of them eat with great relish while DREW continues to

play
DREW stops and they all sit silently

LEWIS
(in what is for
him a soft voice)
You know we donit have too many more
years forthis kind of thing

ED
Oh I guess not But I can tell you I’m
glad we came Im damned glad This is
a great place tobe right nowThe greatest

They are relaxed euphoric except for LEWIS He still has
an ear cocked for the voices of the night the sounds of the
forest He is watching out he is ready But this just
makes the others more secure and easy

BOBBY
(a Little drunk)
Its true Lewis what you said Theres
something in the woods and the water
that we lost in the city

LEWIS
We didnt lose it we sold it

35 (Cont1)
BOBBY gets up and stretches

BOBBY
But at least technology produced the
air mattress - or as itts better known
in camp circles - the instant broad

ED
(moving to the
tent with a yawn)
To say nothing of that nylonkapok
miracle - the sleeping bag

LEWIS has been standing a little apart from the others Now

he raises his arm in a gesture which says keep still and be
quiet They freeze in their stretching or stooping or crouc-
ing postures and listen The nolses of the night amplify as
they strain to hear- the creaks and cries the sighing trees
all indecipherable to a blunt city ear

LEWIS is absolutely motionless yet coiled up ready to
spring

The ease and well-being drains out of them as the forest be-
comes threatening full of menace

O Suddeniy LEWIS slips into the black woods He makes no sound
and and he is gone as though he never existed

BOBBY
(shaking his
head exasperated)
This guy is unbelievable All day
hets been an Indian Brave and now he
has to play Tarzan

ED

(still apprehensive)
He knows the woods though He really j
does a

DREW
Hes learnt them He doesnt feel
them Thats Lewis problem He wants
to be one with nature and hes not

BOBBY
So we have to endure these melodramatic
games
m They look about them nervously They feel vulnerable and
e abandoned

ED
(wryly)
Do you realize if it wasnt for this
madman wed all be home in bed with
doors locked against the night

BOBBY
And armfulls of warm women

They are like mutinous schoolboys They start to giggle
Suddenly LEWIS materialises at their side BOBBY starts with

surprise

BOBBY
Jesus Lewis You scared the shit
out of me

ED
What was it Lewis

LEWIS surveys the camp site the firelight licking the long
tree shadows He is very caim

LEWIS
Humans They were watching us
DREW
Did you catch up with them
LEWIS
No
BOBBY
So what Im going to sleep Fuck it
DREW

Maybe it was just the Gods Lewis out
walking in the forest

ED
Well to the sleeping bags men

LEWIS looks out over the river as though with some secret

knowledge

BOBBY
Had my first wet dream in a sleeping
bag I surely did

ED
(with interest but
not a whole iot)
How was it

BOBBY
Great Theres no repeating it

There is a long sigh and then no sound

EXT CAMPING GROUND DAWN

The two tents lie under a shroud of mist which has come up
over the river and spilied out through the forest

It is very still ED slips out of his tent He wears long
Johns the colour of fog and he is scarcely visibie

EXT RAVINE ABOVE CAMP DAWN

As he begins to walk stealthiiy away from the tents he re-
veals his bow in his right hand

He moves up along the smali ravine or draw that runs back
inland He moves very cautiously the bow aiways ready but
there is a distinct feeling that he is playacting He
doesnt really think he is going to come on any game

He goes along like this for perhaps twenty or thirty careful
steps until the land begins to rise and the fog as a con-
sequence starts to thin out

ED is more visible now a ridiculous figure in long under-
wear in the wocds and he too obviously feels himself to
be pretty absurd

He turns around to ‘start back down somewhat angry with him-
self

He is getting back into the river-fog now when to the left
there is a slight movement He stops and peers as he tries

to make out what is causing it Gradually it becomes appar-
ent that it is a little deer a spike buck probably

ED slowly raises the bow scarcely daring to breathe scarcely
believing in his luck ana not knowing reaily whether he
witl acuually shoot or not tne orange frame ol thread on
his bowstring comes back as he draws the bow until it is
framing his eye A great flush of excitement comes over ED
and he starts tc tremble -

At first the sight is not on the deer and he tries to frame
the animal siowly very slowly The deer is browsing not

‘looking up and ED brings him right to the center of the

blurred frame of string

that he has botched the shot after all that preparation
His left hand bow-hand has jerked just as the shot went

ED

God damn it
He snatches loose another arrow from the bow-quiver He
draws again The deer which has evidently jumped a little
farther away watches him but the peep sight is swinging
erratically and doesnt frame the deer but once or twice
almost does The bow twangs as ED releases and the deer
jumps and soundlessly vanishes

ED very deliberately throws the bow into a bush just as a
golfer would toss a club

ED
Well thats that

He retrieves the bow and starts down noisily awkwardly
not looking out for deer any more and then he is back at
the tents This mist is thinning out it is by now almost
gone

tN 38 EXT CAMP SITE DAY

DREW its folding his bedroll He laughs at the sight of ED
and he calls into one of the tents for BOBBYwho is irritably
dressing

DREW
Hey Bobby Look what came out of
the forest

BOBBY
(without humor
or irony)
Yeah

LEWIS is making a fire with twigs He turns and sees ED and
gives a sharp look at the two empty slots in the bow quiver

EXT RIVER BANK DAY

ED sits in the leaded canoe holding the bank as BOBBY
climbs and crumples into the bow

ED looks at BOBBY apprehensively then turns to call back to
LEwIs

ED
Were gonna sail on out Well take
it-slow

LEWIS is still packing gear into their canoe while DREW
douses the campfire

When they get out into midstream it becomes evident as to
just how inept BOBBY is Hes in terrible shape physically
as he is unco-ordinated he is unwilling he is disagreeable

BOBBY
I hope to God we can get off this
fucking river today

ED
Ah now Its not all that bad

BOBBY
Its not Listen mosquitoes ate me
up last night My bites have got bites
Itm catching a fucking cold from sleep-
ing on the fucking ground and Im
hungry as hell for something that
tastes good And I dont mean sorghum

Puck it Lets get on with it Im
tired of this woods scene Im tired
of shitting in a hole in the ground
This is for the Indians

They go along for a while not speaking and they make some-
what better progress

EXT THE RIVER ‘DAY
The canoes cut through a dazzling silver sundrenched river

The land gets wilder and more thickly-wooded A heron
glides out low over the river lazily following its contours

The river is placid and ED must paddle steadily to make pro-
gress He keeps having to wipe sweat out of his eyes He
squints at the sunfilled river He scoops up water and
rinses his face

ED and BOBBY swallow beer

The bow lies in the canoe and the river slides past it with
its black and green orange-feathered arrows the heads
shining with deadly light

LEWIS canoe is out of sight as ED and BOBBY pass through
dense fir forest -silent mysterious stifling

A SNAKE slips into the water and swims with exactly the same
motion as crawling on land across in front of the canoe
then disappears still in the same motion and at the same
speed in the weeds on the other side

BORBY
(speaking back over
his shoulder)
Lets for Gods sake not turn over here

ED
No buddy We wont

They are now getting awfully hot and tired They finish the
last two beers of the six-pack BOBBY throws his can care-
lessly into the river and ED carefully holds his underwater
until it fills and then lets it go down

ED keeps shifting around uncomfortably trying to ease his
back his right hip He keeps running his tongue around in-

ho (Cont)
aca side his dry mouth and picking up water from the river and
i putting it on his head

BOBBY
(half-turning again)

is getting to me

not sesing it)

others to catch up Maykbs theyve

ie EXT RESTING PLACE DAY

They pull in and tis QE to the bank then ciimb cut and sit
down reiieved to bs in the shade BOBBY unties a hanker-
chief frem around his neck and leans down and sops it in the

times to get the kinks cut He peers ‘upriver once again
dcesn’t see anything then turns tack to say something to

them may have a gun but this is not clear yet

The TWO MEN emergs from tne brush chsir Limbs curiously a-

4 THE MEN are still stepping forward with a curious tiptoeing
sideways walk as though stepping around something that no
one but them can see is there

If there were ever any degenerate red-necks they are these
two One of them is about fifty-five in overalls and a
filthy work shirt He has a mangy whitish beard The other
one the man with the gun is younger and his toothlessness
should be the most obvious thing about him He is not wear-
ing overalls but just a ragged dirty shirt and pants They
keep coming

The OLDER MAN comes up to ED and gets himself ridiculously
close The faces are no mors than four or five inches apart
There is silence while the man looks fiercely and ED tries
to think of something to say

BEARDED MAN
(revealing awful stumps
of teeth orange and broken)
What the hail you think youre doing

ED
(as matter-of-factly
as he can
Going down river Weve been going

BEARDED MAN looks at TALL MAN and something significant
seems to pass between them

to teil his story)

With a very slight move the TALL MAN gets himself nearer

to BOBBY

ED

(trying to be as

convincing and

harmiess and as

full of good will

toward strangers

as he can)
Hell we sure dont want any trouble

by this time)
Look I dont know what youre

but definitely

The TALL MAN levels the shotgun right at EDs chest

ED
(as though the inter-
view were over)
Wed better get on with it Weve
got a long ways to go

ED half-raises his arms as though playing a part in a movie
about badmen He cannot believe that this is happening
The four of them go inland a few steps from the river be-
hind a screen of bushes and weeds

TALL MAN
Back up to that saplin

ED
(indicating a tree
with his raised hands)
This one

ED backs up to a small tree and the TALL MAN working
quickly and expertly takes off EDs web belt with the knife
and nylon rope on it lets the belt out and puts it around
ED and the tree with the buckle on the other side of the
tree He takes the knife out of the belt slowly and
stands looking at it with the shotgun pointing at BOBBY

TALL MAN
(mock admiringly)
Look at that I bet thatll shave

BEARDED MAN
Why ont you try it Looks like thatns
got plenty of it ‘Cept on his head

Very deliberately the TALL MAN takes hold of the zipper to
EDs coveralls and with a quick movement like tearing
ED apart he zips it down to the belt with which ED is tied
to the tree

BEARDED MAN
Good God Almighty Hes like a god-
amned monkey You ever see anything

TALL MAN begins to breathe faster panting and his face
takes on a malevolent expression He looks quitely liter-
ally as if he would do anything is just about to do it
in fact Suddenly and very unexpectedly he raises the
Knife over his head and drives it down with all his might
with a furious and final movement It appears to have
entered ED

ED responds in shocked horror as though he has been mortally
wounded - But the knife has in fact been struck into the
tree right next to ED’s head

THE TWO MEN now converge on BOBBY The BEARDED MAN takes
BOBBY by the shoulder and turns him to face downstream

BEARDED MAN

oo (very matter-of-

CA fact)

— Now let‘s you just drop them pants
BOBBY

(afraid to
comprehend )
Dropco

TALL MAN
(putting muzzle of
shotgun under
Bobbys ear)

Just take ‘em right on off

BOBBY
(weakly)
I mean whats this all

BEARDED MAN
Dont say nothin’ Just do it

THE TALL MAN shoves at BOBBYs head with the gun suddenly

and viciously The TALL MANs actions are abrupt and deadly

BOBBY slowly unbuckles his belt and unbuttons his pants

He takes them off looking around ridiculously for a place
€ to put them down

BOBBY takes off his shorts like a boy undressing for the
first time in a gym

TALL MAN
(gesturing with gun)
See that log Walk over yonder

BOBBY walks uncertainly over to a big rotten log on the
ground and stands there just BOBBY and the log in some
sort of as-yet-undivulged relationship

TALL MAN
Now git on down crost it

He puts the gun muzzle right under BOBBYs right ear

ED watches horrified the knife stuck in the tree next to
his head a little blood trickling from under his chin ° He
shifts and gasps for breath against the tightness of the
belt

The BEARDED MAN unfastens his pants while the TALL MAN
stands impassively over BOBBY pointing the gun

EDs face again waiting to see and not wanting to averting
his eyes as BOBBYs first scream comes There is a note of
dreadful surprise in it More screams come of animal pain
becoming rhythmic

ED looks straight before him now his eyes deadened and withou-
hope not responding to the screams anymore

Then his look changes his focus shifts His face takes on- ‘
‘an expression of unbelief and the beginnings of a fantastic
kind of hope

Through a slit in a curtain of leaves is the green canoe
with LEWIS and DREW in it They both have their paddles out
of the water Then the canoe disappears as though it had
never been ED shakes his head as though he believes he ‘
may be hallucinating

ED looks back toward the bushes as the BEARDED MAN rises
a little unsteadily to his feet There are no more screams
Cc The BEARDED MAN makes a long strange sigh as he stands
SON there buttoning his pants There is a glimpse of BOBBY
ed rolling in pain under the bushes

After they reorganise themselves for a moment the TALL MAN
and the BEARDED MAN without saying a word turn from BOBBY
and advance with dreadful purpose toward the tree where ED

is tied ED watches them come step by step the TALL MAN

still with the gun

The BEARDED MAN goes around behind the tree ED and the
tree jerk violently and ED suddenly falls free He almost
stumbles but brings up quickly for the gun-muzzie is just
under his nose

TALL MAN
Youre hairy as a god-damned dog
aint you

‘ ED
(gasping resigned to
anything but having
his head blown off)
Some dogs I suppose

TALL MAN
(half turning to
Bearded Man)
Now what the hail

BEARDED MAN
Aint no hair in his mouth

TALL MAN
(with a terrible
toothless grin)
Thats the truth Hold this on him

The TALL MAN extends his hand with gun in it to the BEARDED
MAN all the time still looking straight at ED

TALL MAN
(with deadly
seriousness)
Fall down on your knees boy You
gonna do a little praying And you
better pray gocd

TALL MAN begins to unbutton his pants ED goes down slowly
to his knees the BEARDED MAN gets ready to position himself

to hold the gun on ED the TALL MAN loosening his pants

There is an odd sound a kind of quick slap-snap a sound
like a quick sharp indrawn breath

’ ( )

() hl (cont7)

at The BEARDED MAN makes a loud involuntary surprised gasp
like that of a man with the wind knocked out of him unex-
pectedly He does not yet look down

ED looks sharply at the BEARDED MANs face and then quickly
at his chest A foot and a half of bright red arrow is
protruding from the middle of it

They all three hang motionless for a moment too amazed to
act The gun starts to fall from the BEARDED MANs hand

ED is nearest it and he grabs for it clumsily but with the
strength of panic The TALL MAN also reaches for it and
even touches it briefly but ED has a better grip this is
instantaneously recognized by both of them and then the
TALL MAN leaps away into the bushes and is gone The leaves
do not even tremble where he disappears

ED rises transfigured by terror and by the turn events have
taken He is beast-like with the power of having the gun
He wraps the string the gun uses for a trigger around his
hand and swings the barrel to cover the woods and everything
in it to be able to blast whatever will come

° BOBBY still tightly curled up in his private pain begins to
C comprehend the situation has altered

The BEARDED MAN is standing stock still with his feet wide
apart He reaches down with a trembling broken-nailed
hand and touches the shaft of the arrow delicately

He falls to his knees and then to his side rolling back

and forth spitting and gritting his teeth Then he gets
with awful comic seriousness back onto his feet again this
time with his lips red with blood and drooling saliva and-
blood He turns toward the wocds and takes a couple of halt-
‘ing steps toward them and then seems to change his mind

and turns back to ED holding out one hand like an Olid Testa
ment prophet about to divulge a secret to one of the chosen

ED makes the decision to fire He begins to pull out the
string utter determination on his face

But thare is no need Suddenly the BEARDED MAN falls

partly on his face and partly on his side his face coming
to rest on the tops of EDs white tennis shoes He has a
bubble of blood in his mouth red as an apple ‘

ED lowers the gunbarrel a little

the bushes)
Lord God Lord God

‘ED looks down at the BEARDED MAN The silver of the alumi-
nium arrow-shaft and the fancy blue-and-silver marking of
the white-feathered arrow stick out of his back

ED peers into the woods swinging the half-lowered gun back
and forth and nothing else happens

Then there is a faint stirring in the bushes ED swings
towards it LEWIS comes cautiously forward another arrow
on the string his -bow at the ready He comes slowly into
the clearing DREW is behind him holding and canoe paddle
like a baseball bat

LEWIS walks out between ED and BOBBY and looks down at the
BEARDED MAN He puts his bow-tip on a leaf and gazes at it
about to say something

LEWIS
en (meditatively)
A Well now how about this I mean
i just how about this

DREW moves to BOBBY and crouches down beside him He puts
his hand on BOBBY’s shoulder very sympathetic and gentle
BOBBY glances at himwith a look of gratitude Finally

‘ BOBBY gets painfully vp and DREW helps him Dazed furious
and incongruous BOBBY picks up his pants and shorts fum-
pling takes a handkerchief from a pocket and goes back be-
hind the bushes

Meanwhile LEWIS leans on his bow and gazes out over the
river When he speaks it is decisively but distant

LEWIS
figured it was the only thing to do

ED
(not sure as
all that)

What are we going to do with him

DREW comes up washing his hands with dirt and beating them
against the sides of his legs

DREW
(decisively)
Theres not but one thing to do Put
the body in one of the canoes and take
it down to Aintry and turn it over to
the highway patrol Tell them what

ED glances at DREW uncertainly and then looks back at LEWIS

(gazing out over
the river)

little more passionate

afraid of what might be)

onto the river)

He breaks off as they react to a kind of terrible sigh

something like the sound the BEARDED MAN gave out when he

finished with BOBBY For a moment the city men look around
and then LEWIS stoops swiftly down to the BEARDED MAN The
‘ BEARDED MAN sighs again a long sobbing sound and then
slumps completely

out over the river again

LEWIS

anybody know anything about the law

DREW
Ive been on fury duty exactly once

BOBBY comes up fiery-faced and violated and with that
vindictiveness that only the violated have He shakes his
head his eyes murderously narrow
LEWIS

not reply or even seem to hear but goes quite deliberate-
ly over to the corpse and stands looking down at it Sud-
denly without any warning at all he kicks it as hard as
he can in the face and before LEWIS can stop him does
it again

almost superhumanly apprehensive and alert Then his eyes
come back to LEWIS and they see LEWIS standing relaxed
leaning on his bow apparently not worried at ali in come

voice)

LEWIS turns to ED as though playing his trump card which
indeed he is

DREW suddenly steps over the corpse and confronts ED putting
the flat of his hand in front of EDs face and shaking it

with violent emphasis He has got to get ED to agree with

There is silence LEWIS waits confidently DREW is grim
and adamant BOBBY is full of hatred and ED is coming to
the all-important decision

ED
(leaning out so as to
speak to Lewis around
Drew)
Im with you

The spell of debate and decision-making is over
LEWIS gets down by the corpse again all business this time

LEWIS
All right then

LEWIS drags the arrow-shaft out of the body slowly and
laboriously broadhead first He wipes off the worst of the
blood then clips it into his bow-quiver where it looks
just like the others except that it is red

ED takes his knife out of the sapling puts it in the scab-
bard and buckles on the belt with the knife and the rope

LEWIS with silent signals positions each of the MEN to
carry the CORPSE They are very awkward about it with ED

and DREW carrying the shoulders and LEWIS and BOBBY the feet

They begin to carry the BODY feet-foremost into the woods -
away from the river

EXT DENSE WOODS DAY

They flounder in the bushes almost falling from time to
time BOBBY cursing and so one

LEWISs face is calm and purposeful and DREW keeps shaking
his head as though he simply cannot believe in this folly

As the undergrowth thickens branches whip back suddeniy and
‘strike them in their faces Nobody says anything to anybody
else the only things to be heard from the FOUR MEN are ex-
clamations and an occasional startled curse

With a sudden movement LEWIS shifts his part of the corpse
to ED and doubles back the way they have come He runs
crouching like an animal darting in and out of the trees
He has drawn his knife

The THREE MEN struggle on ED grunting with his increased
burden

a

42 (Cont)

“43

After a moment LEWIS appears at his side taking his share
of the weight again

LEWIS
Hes not following But well make
sure theres no tracks This way

LEWIS leads them to the left where a creek is revealed They
scramble into the muddy water and wade up it laboriously

The forest here has a funereal swampy look The MEN toii
along with the BODY They are now absolutely covered and
drenched with sweat from the stifling breathless quality
of this part of the woods They climb out of the creek and
twist and turn among the trees until there is a feeling of
utter lostness

EXT SWAMPY FOREST - DAY

Unexpectedly LEWIS holds up a hand and following his
example the others aid him in letting the corpse down onto

the ground
LEWIS motions for ED and ED steps up to him In a kind of

silent ceremonyvery ritualisticeLEWIS unclips the
death-arrow and ‘hands it to ED who takes it not knowing
exactly what LEWIS wants him to do with it He examines it
as he would any other arrow then hands it back to LEWIS

They are next to a blue-black seepage of water like a sump
of some kind As though he were competing in anarchery
tournament LEWIS puts the arrow on the string of his bow and
draws it

In the act of drawing it he appears to aim up into the trees
and EDs eyes follow the projection that the arrow might
take But very dramaticallyLEWIS slowly brings it down
until the arrow is pointing directly at the swampy ground

He holds the arrow at full draw for a long endless moment
mesmerising the others in the tension he creates He is con
centrating utterly He releases

The death-arrow disappears into earth It is perfect He

is deep in what is almost a Zen-like concentration There is
no trace of the arrow It mighs have gone a mile deep or
even penetrated the very heart of the earth itself

LEWIS breaks his own spell by bending down to pick up ths
corpse the others follow his example They struggle on with
it for a while

LEWIS turns pointing down directly underfoot The MEN put
the body down

4h

EXT BURIAL PLACE DAY

LEWIS falls to his knees and starts digging with his bare
hands The others come down to the ground with him and start
digging too

It is fairly easy work and they do it gladly even DREW in
a kind of a frenzy to get rid of the body They dig like
dogs throwing dirt this way and that

The self-absorbed efficiency of DREW who is working harder
and getting more done than any of them is very striking
Their breathing is heavy and irregular in the ominous silence

Finally LEWIS stops digging It is a very makeshift grave
indeed with ferns growing around it The body lies there
beside the digging men serene and indifferent and the gun
beside it

They stand up and regard their work LEWIS solemnly nods his
head DREW crosses himself Then they roli the corpse in a
very undignified way into the grave LEWIS reaches back and
gets the gun He puts it into the grave looks at his
arrangement for a moment then reaches back into ths trench

“and makes some final adjustments He draws back apparentiy

The FOUR MEN shovel and scramble the dirt back into the grave
The body slowly being made to disappear under the four-part
volley of dirt and leaves At last he is totally covered
and LEWIS smooths the leaf-mold over him They are ail ludi-
crously kneeling before the grave

DREW looks intently at ED as though his gaze were willing
ED to do something before it gets to be too late

LEWIS
(with conviction)
‘Fernsll be growing here in a few
days Nobodyd ever come on him in
a million years I doubt if even we
could find this piace again —

DREW

EXT THE RESTING PLACE DAY

The FOUR MEN scramole into the two canoes and shove off
They hastily rearrange their gear as they move out into the
current They are desperate to be away Ail except LEWIS
who is relaxed and seems almost reluctant to leave the place
where he killed THE MAN He looks at it intently

LEWIS
It never happened Think of it as
a dream

BOBBY
Lewis Lets get the fuck out of

ED

Whats the plan Lewis

LEWIS

(soothingly)

Plan Why we just paddle on down
to Aintree pick up those cars and
go home What elss

The river is transformed for them ominous and threatening
every dark opening in the trees a possibie menace every
turn in the river a dangerous event They jerk their heads
from side to side wild hunted animal looks ED ard DREW
are together asain in the aluminium canoe while LEWIS and
BOBBY are in the heavy wooden one ED and DREW get a Littie
ahead ED brings his bow up close to him ready

While all this is going on they have baan moving into a
gorge The rosk-face rises and narrows in ths sound of the
river changes reverberating intensifying

ED tries to speak to DREW but cannot get through to him ‘The
sound of the river as it comes back off the cliff-walis is
now such that the human voice can hardly be heard at all
even when it shouts its loudest

UT

EXT THE GORGE DAY

ED glances to his left and his gaze travels up the wall
awsomely higher and higher until he sees that the gorge is
at least a hundred and fifty feet high or maybe even higher
ED looks apprehensively at this all the time in the tremen-
dous sound of the reverberating water

The river is beginning to fall more abruptly There are
more rapids and more rocks ED and DREW are working hard to
Keep the canoe going straight They are covered with spray
and foam the canoe pitches and bucks

They come into a comparatively calm stretch between ravids
and go around a turn A long stretch of -very rough water
lies ahead going out of sight around another curve It
looks awfully rough too rough

‘ ED
(screaming at the top
of his lungs)
Lets go right down the middle ive
me some speed baby

Something happens to DREW 1 is impossible to tell what Hé
shakes his head violently (but this might just be the canoe
bumping on a rock) and his paddle is whirled out of his hand
by the river

He pitches over or is thrown over or something Whatever it
is the canoe goes out of control ED lets go of his paddle

and grabs for the bow at his feet as his last act before the

canoe overturns in the boiling angry murderous water

EXT THE GREAT RAPIDS DAY

ED is part of the river turning over and over banging on
stones sometimes out of the water and sometimes under it
rushing along with unbelievable force

Momentarily he surfaces facing back up river as LEWIS and

BOBBY founder helplessly on the first canoe

LEWIS and BOBBY spill out on opposite sides and the two
eanoes roil over and over each other like icogs until the
wooden canoe bursts open on a rock

ED struggies desperately with the water trying to get his
feet forward of him After several attemps he succeeds His
body elongates in the river He has the bow and he begins
to slither over moss-covered rocks on his back He hits the
back of his head on one big rock but then seems to get the
hang of it There is a curious look of pained pleasure on
his face as he slides along still alive

A deeper turmoil of water sucks him under despite the life-
jacket

Then the last of the ranids are ahead and ED goes over them
over a last big rock and down into calm water

EXT POOL AT BASE OF GORGE DAY

ED floats cradling the bow in the slow water below the
falls he is a tiny figure idly turning in the aftermath
of the furious white water down between the enormous wings
of the gorge-sides

He lies back in his life-jacket as though on a bed He is
groggily trying to assess his situation He grimaces with
pain and lifts his left hand out of the water He has hold
of the arrows in the bow-quiver by the arrowheads themselves
He lets go and his palm is washed with blood

ED clumsily tries to rearrange himself in the water trying
to get into position to look upstream at the last of the
rapids he has just come down trying to look for the others
He keeps looking at the last rocks of the rapids but can
see no sign of life

A man flops over the rocks of the white water completely
out of control and he recognizes after a bit that it is
BOBBY

BOBBY starts to splash his way to the side Through no
fault of his own unhurt Soon LEWIS is spewed out of the
rapids one hand holding his paddle and the other over his
face

LEWIS writhes and twists in the water ED moves towards “
him

LEWIS

ED and LEWIS reach the bank where BOBBY leans out to help

LEWIS crow-hops and gets himself onto a big rock where he
collapses ED goes to him and tries to make him comfortable
LEWIS is still holding onto his face with a hand his pain
obviously all but intolerable ED bends down to him for it
appears as though LEWIS is trying to say something

LEWIS
(against the ever-
present river sound)
Drew was shot I saw it Hes
dead

ED is stunned Even in this condition LEWIS has the power
to shake his equilibrium The roar of the rapids is deaf-
ening They have to shout to be heard above it

ED
Was that it Something happened

But I-dont know Shit Lewis
what a mess you got us in to

He gets up from LEWISs side and turns uneasily to BOBBY

ED
Lets try and find Drew

He wades back into the water with that special revulsion
that it takes to get back into cold water once you have left
it BOBBY follows him

BOBBY
Shot

They swim about somewhat aimlessly for a moment or two then
something comes tumbling down the rapids They both see it

water

looks up the gorgeside LEWIS writhes on the ground under
them and a muffled groan escapes him

BOBBY
What are you going to do I mean
how will you find him

ED
If I get up there Im going to do just
exactly what I would do if I was him
There are some rapids right below here
and he wont want to shoot at us when

same with the other

ED
Ive got one good arrow and another

BOBBY stands without saying anything and ED crouches down
beside LEWIS who is grinding the back of his head into the
sand in pain

EXT CLIFF FACE oo NIGHT

ED coils the nylon rope and puts his left arm between the
bowstring and the bow with the arrowheads turned down He
looks up the cliff one last time then runs hard at it
scrambles pulls up and works himself up onto a little ledge
about twelve or fifteen feet above the river He turns around
and stands there looking out over the water

The moon has risen over the river The last of the rapids
they have come down are on the right on the left are the
rapids further downstream ED watches the river for a moment
mesmerised by its mystery

He turns back to the cliff tries some hand and foot positions
and begins to inch up EDS hands grope finding holds his
feet doing the same He begins to sweat and his breathing gets
harsher The cliff is getting steeper as it gets higher He
is beginning to labor and strain for every inch and his
breathing begins to sound more and more desperate

He climbs up a kind of funnel where water trickles down from a
spring He climbs by bracing himself in this ‘chimney’ The
water runs over him He pauses for a moment and smiles at a
lone flower growing out of the rock

Now he reaches an absolute impasse he cant go-up any farther
and he cant go down He cant go to the right or to the left
He is trapped terrified and helpless There is absolutely
nothing he can do He looks down over his shoulder There is
the bright moon-pit and it must be a hundred and fifty feet
below him He turns back to the cliff leaning his face
against it sobbing all control just about gone

Suddenly he makes a lunge at the cliffup the cliffhis
hand catches on something He gets hold of something with the
other hand and there is a wild hope in his face the last
hope of all

Ed pulls up and gets himself into a kind of narrow crevice or
niche in the cliff In doing this he almost loses the bow

but manages just barely to save it He stretches out on the
floor of the niche breathing heavily and trembling It is

as though he were lying in a coffin except that he is sweating
so heavily

Aftera while he props-up on one elbow and looks over the side
of the crevice down at the river He lies there stroking the
curves of the bow looking down at the wild Godlike and minde-
less beauty of the river on fire with moonlight

ED
(mumbling profoundly)
‘What a view What e view

50 (Cont) L

Sl

He lies watching the river intently

ED has leaned out to see the view better and almost falls The
bow slithers over the side and he just manages to save it He
jerks back Slowly he feels the crevice above his head and
around the top of it to see whats there Painfully he begins
to get himself together once more to climb

He gets a holda fairly good holdon something and drags
himself upward out of the crevice He climbs in a kind of
trance his fingers like independent beings crawl over the
surface hauling the body after them

He is so high over the river that the scene is both awesome
and ridiculous He is still inching up and up and up

The cliff is not as steep as it was things are going better
ED begins to crawl on his knees He slithers and wriggles
upward and the sound of his breath is like that of a man who
sees that he might after all be able to do what hes trying to
do might be able to do it and probably will There is 4
kind of rage of incredible belief and joy in EDs breathing
it is almost bestial

He looks up and the enormously intense moon is right in his
face coming down through a crack in the rock He makes for
the crack gets into it rises from his knees stumbles forward
among rocks and bushes sobbing with relief

He looks down at his feet amazed to discover he can walk

EXT CLIFF TOP NIGHT

He stands on the top of the cliff looking down at the enormous
mindless blazing of the moonlit river He has made it and his
attitude as he stands there is not completely mortal or ever
human It is more godlike or demonic But it is not quite ft
the face hes had before at all

ED examines the cliff top very carefully He comes to a big
boulder with an open space that gives a perfect view of the
river below

ED nods he figures that this might indeed be the place He
moves around experimenting with positions The ground is soft
and he leaves heavy tracks

ED gets down at the very edge of the cliff in the prone
position for firing a rifle He sights an imaginary rifle

down on the river He looks around The woods are very thick
just back off the little open space hes in He goes back into
them and ED selects a tree and climbs it with much labored
movement and a few slips

EXT TREEHIDE NIGHT

He opens the pine branches slowly with one hand and looks out
on little open space which is below him and about fifteen
yards away

He breaks one or two branches to make the view permanent He
adjusts his feet and body then puts an arrow on the bow gets
himself set and comes back to full draw He does this two or
three times until hes satisfied He then hangs the bow on
the limb and tries to get comfortable in the tree to wait for
the first light He stares fixedly without expression into
the ‘tunnel’ he will shoot down

EXT CLIFF TOP NIGHT TO DAY

The trees river and cliff top strong dark shapes in the
brilliant moonlight now melt slowly into a flat grey dawn

EXT TREEHIDE DAY

He is dozing in the tree his head back against the bole
The bow hangs beside his head and a little light glints on
the two arrowheads

Suddenly ED starts almost falls catches himself and looks
around with exhausted eyes But he is awake enough to know
that the sun is just beginning to appear He shakes his head
like a boxer trying to shake off a punch

ED peers this way and that trying to see a little more He
blinks his eyes like a man who has not had anywhere nearly
enough sleep He looks down into the sandy shelf There is a
pair of feet - bootsstanding on the shelf barely inside
EDs range of vision

EDs face is pure terror He keeps looking and the feet on
the ground move until most of the whole man passes through
EDs line of sight and then out of it to the other upriver
sides But he has seen enough to know that the MAN is carrying
a rifle

ED cranes to see the MAN but cant make him out again Then
the feet appear on the other side of the tunnel of branches
stop for a moment then come right to the center of it and
stop What ED can see of the MAN indicates that he is looking
at the ground examining it maybe EDs tracks of course
are what hes looking at Hardly daring to move ED stretches
out for his bow hanging on a branch It creaks as he takes
hold of it ED winces at the sounds he is making His hands
tremble uncontrollably as he takes an arrow and strings it
Inch by inch he levels the bow then slowly pulls back the
string

Sk (Cont)
The vertical rectangle of the peep sight onthe string wavers
backjust as it did when ED hunted the deer He holds at
full draw fighting to control the trembling that racks his
whole body

He adjusts the peep sight up and down right and left until
little by little in the wavering peep sight the MAN is framed

Then with a shock ED notices what THE MAN is doing he is
getting the gun ready and his eyes are following EDs tracks
straight to the tree They reach the tree and slowly begin

to rise from the ground In a moment he is going to be looking
up through the tunnel into EDs face

With a kind of strangled cry ED releases The peepsight snaps
away Then all hell breaks loose

Thé whole tree shakes violently as though a giant ax had
struck it and at the same time there is a tremendous explosion
as the gun goes off in what had been utter silent concentration
Then ED is falling through the tree branches slapping at him
turning whirling about him He cries out then crashes to the
ground with tremendous impact

He is on the ground without his bow not knowing quite what has
happened shaken terrified He tries to move Ee criss out
‘) in pain startingly and as though he is discovering that he
has broken a leg a rib or something else He raises his
as head cautiously

He sees THE MAN with the gun staggering towards him THE MAN
fires the gun at the tree up into the branches Then he
stops swaying a little and looks right into EDs face He
raises the gun to shoot again but fires into the ground just
in front of his feet At the same moment ED ducks down
terrified He crawls a few feet and after a moment carefully
raises his head again

THE MAN is on his knees He is turned sideways reveealing for
the first time the arrow almost its whole length coming out
the back of his throat It waggles horribly behind him He
is retching and the violence of his retching shakes the arrow
loose and it falls from him

ED watches with horrified fascination

- ED
Die My God Die die

ED puts his head back down and is still apparently unconscious
Then he slowly raises himself te do something but this time it

Q is not to look at the dying man but at himself
Ny He looks down at his side and it has an arrow sticking through
it Still attached to the arrow by the lower part of the bow-

quiver is the broken bow (

Sh (Cont1)

ED puts his head down once more trying to organize
himself to find what to do Finally he pulls himself
to a sitting position and cautiously with great
obvious pain tries to pull the arrow out of his side

He cant and he sees he cant With great effort he
pulls the big knife out of the scabbardand cuts
away the material from the flying suit hes wearing
from around the arrow He tries in a gingerly way to
cut the arrow out Then he seizes the knife in both
hands and drives it down He explodes in a scream
something like BOBBYs in the rape sceneand the
knife falls ringing on stone

Once more he reaches down to his side and this time
in some way he comes away with the arrow He sits
for a moment with the bloody shaft in his hands like
a religious object just looking at it and it is
bloody indeed

Now he looks over the rock again onto the sandy shelf
THE MAN has gone

ED gets to his feet painfully protecting his hurt
side He picks up the bloody knife and with a great
deal of awkwardness and effort cuts a sleeve off his
outfit and a long strip from one leg and puts the
sleeve over the wound as a bandage and binds it with
the strip of nylon from the leg He is a weird-looking
figure when this has been done He hugs his side with
a crooked arm and leans into the wound as hs walks

He moves out onto the sandy shelf He goes to the
place where THE MAN was and stands looking down
swaying and thinking

ED gets down on one knee wincing with pain and runs
his hand-over the rocks and sand He picks up a
handful of sand with blood in it and rifles through it
like a placer-miner examining gold-dust

Still on his knees he follows the blood trail of the
hurt MAN He looks for it and finds it on stones
on pine needles on blades of grass

Su (Cont 2)

ED follows the blood rock by rock following the blood
spoor like a dog would

He moves on stone by stone leaf by leaf irregularly
stopping sometimes to search then finding the blood again
and going on

His head low down he is startled to suddenly come upon the
rifle

It is long and flat and old Oddly it is a repeating rifle
rather than a shuck-action ED touches it

He goes on past the gun and into a canopy of leaves

Here it is harder to find the blood He looks at bushes
at the leaves on bushes individually at pinestraw at small
pebbles Back and forth Finally he finds one drop and
this one drop draws him further on deeper in

EXT CLEARING IN WOODS DAY

ED gets to his feet with a weird corckscrew movement He is
in a clearing

He stands there swaying not knowing what to do looking
about

ED starts around the perimeter of the clearing He is still
staggering but learning to hold himself together a little
better learning to cope with what he has to cope with

The sun is slanting and shuddering on the ground arcund him
and the wind is sighing inthe branches cverhead He goes
along through this modified cathedral atmosphere looking
for more blood holding his side together holding his own
blood in

He stops peering

There is a dead tree about twenty yards away and something
lying at the foot of it ED moves to this and then looks
down onto the BODY OF A MAN It has hold of one root of the
tree

ED turns him over with a foot He has a hand on his knife
He pulls the knife slowly and purposefully out of the case
and bends down He looks at the CORPSEs face

A scream comes from him a terrible scream of frustration and
horror

ED

The MANs mouth if full of yellow teeth

Shaken and fascinated ED gets down on one knee with the
knife in his hand Shuddering he holds the MANs head and
pries at his upper gum with the knife and an upper plate
begins to slide from it As soon as this is established ED
turns the knife and drives the false teeth back into the
mouth

ED takes the Imife into his hand again A low growl comes

from him This is a moment balanced between infinite
possibilities ED could do anything at this point He has

the face of a primitive man His features are transformed

by extreme effort and lack of sleep He looks savage

EDs breath again harsh and loud Into the breath comes
some kind of crazy melody maybe something of the Beatles
something identifiable There is also some suggestion of
an advertising jingle one of these inescapable tunes from
our daily life

ED
King Size Coke has more for you
King Size Coke has more for you

EDs eyes are truly maniacal as he continues te sing and hum
crazily

Shaken by his own incipient violence ED fumbles the knife
back into the case He takes hold of THE MAN and tries to
get him up on his shoulders in the old firemans carry from
Boy Scout days Finally he gets up with THE MAN ard svarts
back through the cathedral woods with the wind blowing
lightly through the trees and the sunspots dancing on the
ground The weather is pleasant and bright early morning
spring

ED staggers through the bushes with THE MAN on his back He
is barely making it but he is making it They tear through
small boughs of rhododendrons Finally they break through
the last screen of the woods and move slowly back into the
clearing Ed puts the MAN down at almost the exact spot
where he shot him collapsing with him They doth lie per-
fectly still side by side indistinguishable one creature

EXT CLIFF TOP DAY

ED takes the rifle by the barrel swinging it twice arcund
his head like a hammer-thrower and slings it cut ever the
river It falis away spinning It hits the water

Now ED throws the death-arrow and the other one into the
river like spears He picks ‘up the broken bow and he turns
it over in his hands There is the greatest affection in his

face This is the thing that saved all their lives but
mainly his own life

Then the spell breaks and ED-steps deliberately to the
cliff top and pitches the bow over the side It falls away

ED steps back beside the dead MAN and takes stock He
begins to uncoil the rope and it is evident that he has
quite a lot of it

ED ties the rope under the arms of the dead MAN and walks
over and ties the other end to a tree growing at almost the
very edge of the cliff

He goes back to THE BODY and hauls it to the edge of the
cliff takes up the slack in the rope with his hands and
kicks and shoves the body over the cliff with his feet

ED races back and strains to let THE BODY down arm over
arm

It goes hard ED sweats and strains tries to take a turn
of rope around his body finds he cant do it lets the
BODY down foot by foot He backs up and braces himself
against the tree working harder than hes ever worked in
his life

The coil of rope wears slowly very slowly away at EDts
feet

Finally at long last all the rope is gone and ED steps
away from the tree trying to get his hands unclenched He
wrings his hands up and down like someone whos touched a
hot stove trying to get the circulation back into them

He goes to the edge and looks down then gets down on his
knees at the cliffside and takes hold of the rope with both
hands

He gets his feet over the edge and starts downon the rope
letting himself down hand over hand straining and hurting

but going down well enough He scrambles against the cliff-
face with his feet finding footholds

BOBBY hearing something wades out into the river to look
up at ED and THE CORPSE swinging on the rope It is

evident that ED is almost completely exhausted He goes down
toward where the CORPSE dangles below He is almost there

ED stops to rest on a little ledge THE CORPSE is about ten
or fifteen feet under him swinging moodily in the breeze
from the river spinning idly knocking against the cliff
face

ED sits holding the rope He is still about fifty feet up
from the river and he is evidently figuringwhat to dc From
where he sits he can see even LEWIS lying in the bottom of
the canoe LEWISs position is terribly twisted looking and
unnatural He has his hand over his face BOBBY stands
watching

On the ledge ED looks at his free hand flexing the fingers
He slides off the ledge and starts down again

ED is almost on top of THE CORPSE He hangs there for a
moment looking down trying to figure what to do

Suddenly it is as though the film had broken but what has

really happened is that the rope has broken There is an

instant of pure blackness then the sky and the river and the
gorge turn haphazardly and idly about each other There is

a muffled yell The yell is suddenly cut off and ED is in
another world

It is green and quiet underwater ED finds himself intere
twined with the CORPSE whose limbs move under the water with
uncanny animation Jt is as though the man were trying to
embrace ED or drown him He fights free Cocked to one side
of the pervading green is a suffused yellow area and
gradually ED approaches this As he gets cioser to it he
sees that it is something like a submerged sun wavering and
expanding In fact it is the sun and it explodes in his
face as EDs head comes clear of the water

EXT BELOW THE RAPIDS DAY

ED struggles feebly in the water trying to discover if hes
been hurt even more trying to move his arms and legs and
discovering that he can do it He begins with infinite
weariness and effort to swim to the cance

ED reaches the battered side of the canoe standing up in
the shallow water among the rocks and looking over the
gunwale into the bottom of the canoe

BOBBY has reached out to help him in

LEWIS is lying there either dead or barely alive The flcor
of the canoe is awash-with filthy water much of it contain-
ing stuff that LEWIS has vomited up This is floating and
softly sloshing around LEWISs form

BOBBY

happening to us

BOBBY looks searchingly at ED but ED just shakes his head

awful bad hurt

He gets up and they walk over to where the DEAD MAN lies on
the rocks face down with the rope piled on and off him

is hard to tell which is dead and which is not for they
both might be THE CORPSE has a number of rocks tied to him
with cut up lengths of EDs rope

They are moving from the bank out to the middle of the large
pool under the rapids

They ship their paddles and heave out the rocks ‘The
procedure is grotesque and terrifying and also ina
greusome way funny for THE CORPSE does not seem to want to
leave the canoe It hangs spreadeagled on the gunwale In
a wild desperate and abandoned movement ED picks up the
last and diggest rock the one tied around the BODYs neck
and with great effort heaves it out THE CORPSE is whisked
with breathtaking quickmess away and into the river The
canoe rocks widly

ED and BOBBY now begin to paddle very Slowly ina
grotesque parody of canoeing

The canoe moves away down river Neither look back

The canoes turns out of the gorge and into the eye of the
sun and it seems to float upon pure liquid gold pure light
and in the middle of this the TWO exhausted MEN

The sun burns higher Dreamlike the trees drift past them
LEWIS lies with an arm over his face The canoe lides on
through the black water

They come around another turn and there is momentary but
definite impression of a man a body faving the canoe from
some of the river-rocks downstream

Co DREW is sitting in a grotesque position in the rocks as
a though in a kind of natural chair the water flowing over

him propping his head back a thin continuous spray of it
going into his open mouth He has his eyes wide open
gazing upstream as if forever

The canoe rides just past THE BODY and stops

With infinite weariness ED gets out of the canoe onto the
rocks and the shallows around them He walks the length of
the canoe and comes to BOBBY who is stting holding his
half-paddle asleep

He jabs at BOBBY who wakes up and gets slowly out of the
canoe

DREW sits there uncaring a stupid water-caused streaming
grin on his face He even looks happy in a kind of weird
eternal way

ED tries to pull the BODY out of the rocks and at first
cant do it Then he gets THE BODY by the straps of its
life-jacket and hauls it forward The effort makes ED trip
he flounders and falls into the river and THE CORPSE freed
begins to float serenely away

ED flounders after THE CORPSE gets it over to one of the
Cs ‘ rocks and beaches it

He turns THE CORPSE over looking at it intently

beckoning to Bobby

They hang on the rock panting and gasping
ED
Is this a gunshot wound

it sure doesnt look like it to me

put DREWs head up over the gunwale so that LEWIS can have
a close look at the back and side of it

as DREWs

ED holds DREWs head in a gentle grasp turning it slightly
and with the other hand pointing to the place he wants
LEWIS to look at

ED

face He looks maniacal and wise He knows something the
others dont Or does he

downriver in its kapok life jacket going along beside

up but is not particularly dangerous-looking And yet the
sound goes up and up becoming something close to a roar

It draws them out of their torvor They sit up listening

ED
(Afraid to believe
what hes hearing)
Bobby I think I hear rapids I know
I do

EXT FINAL RAPIDS DAY

The canoe begins to move faster then faster end faster
What is out of sight aromnd the next turn is makine the sound
They start to paddle finding energy in the new danger

ED
God God do something for us

They go into the turn and the water is getting vicious
ED and BOBBY work with the stream doing what they can

The sound is now tremendous Sprsy is flying around the
canoe

Coming off the turn there sre rapids as far as the eye can
see seething raging tumultous with the very power of the
universe itself

BOBBY simply flings his half-paddle away and gets ready to
die his hands over his face

ED
(to Bobby)
Get down Get down

BOBBY drops back off his seat holding onto the gunwales
with both hands riding right into the teeth of the white
water

( )
a)

61 (Cont)

The canoe careers through a mist of spray which foams up
sround it seeming to carry it into another element sltogether
Down down they go ss though they will slip off the side of
the world

ED fights to keep the craft straight the paddle almost torn
from his hand by the unbridled violence of the water

LEWIS screams soundlessly as the canoe bucks and scrapes
over rocks

ED has a look of profound exultation on his face of wonder-
ful dreadful enjoyment

(shouts)
Hold on boys Were going home

It becomes evident that this whole set of rapids culminates
in a fall-off of about six feet In other words if they
can get through this theyre out of danger at least from
this particuler set of rapids

They ride up to the fall-off looking at it with horrified
fascination They go up and the canoe is flying it has
leapt out of the river

It comes down with terrific impact It almost capsizes
but doesnt And there it is

EXT FLAT COUNTRY DAY

The canoe idles into the calm water past the falls It is
sloshing with water and LEWIS is practicslly submerged

BOBBY still fallen back from his sest tries to turn and
say something but he doesnt ED pants and heaves for his
bresth He looks down at his side and clenches it with his
arm

Finally ED getting things together in his head speaks

ED
Right here is where it all happened

BOBBY turns around - as much as he can and stares 3s

though a ssvage or a madmen had spoken He has no notion
of whet ED means

ED

BOBBY
(mumbling)
OK
Ed bends forward towards LEWIS
ED
Lewis Lewis Do you hear me
buddy

LEWIS makes no movement but lies as still as ever His

face is badly sunburned his lips cracked It is something

of a shock when he speaks

Lewis
(calmly and clearly)
I hear you Youve got it figured
We can get out of this Youtre
doing it exactly right better than
I could do

ED is distrubed by LEWISs stillness Jt is as though he

has pessed across some threshold to the calm edge of death

ED
Can you hold out a little longer

LEWIS
Sure

ED
There cant be too far to go now

BOBBY
Edi Look here

ED looks up from LEWIS at the river bank where BOBBY is
pointing It is cow a plain black and white Friesian
cow Peacefully it crops the grass at the rivers edge

BOBBY is grinning EDs mouth falls open It is salvation

deliverance indeed

up the Churchill V-for-Victory sign He is very likeable
He too is a new man

ED
We did it
BOBBY
You mean you did it
ED
(proudly but
with conviction)
No
(pause)
We did it

There is that special bond between them that comes from
having been through hell together

The land is domesticated pastoral pleasant

EXT BRIDGE AT AINTRY DAY

ED and BOBBY are beaching the canoe on a bank of shingle
close to a concrete bridge that carries a road over the
river BOBBY sinks down next to the canoe resting a hand
on it minding it

ED
Im going to get help Lewis Youll
- be out of there in no time

ED turns and painfully limps up the slope to the road

EXT ROAD AND BRIDGE DAY

Reaching the rosd ED looks up and down it The road is
straight and emnty and shimmering with heat Througn the
haze some two hundred yards away is 9s gas station - He
starts towards it He is totally exhausted He fixes his
eyes on the gas station concentrating absolutely on the
problem of dragging his body to it

An open truck goes past piled high with the furniture and
belongings of a poor femily TWO CHILDREN sit on s sofa at
the back end watch this curious ragged man holding his”
side walking so slowly

EXT THE GAS STATION Day
A shiftless-looking COUNTRY BOY sits in a kitchen chair
outside the station nropped against the wall He watches
ED coming with widening eyes trying to calculate whether
this man is drunk or sick or mad or whet

Sitting there st the side of the garage are the two cars
DREWs and LEWISts

ED looks at them in astonishment He shakes his head and
blinks as though trying to shake off an hallucination

He stumbles up to them and slaps LEWISs car proving its
reality Then he leans against it and laughs softly

THE BOY gets up and calls over to him

BOY
You came for the cars mister

ED
(looking up)
Nowe YeOS oo Not exacly

THE BOY stands there hopelessly confused

Is there a phone here

BOY
A phone

ED
A telephone

INT THE GAS STATION

ED sits in s chair next to the phone among the pocket combs
for sale and cheap dark glasses His head is slumped back
asleep past caring THE BOY watches him silently not
moving

A hand touches him pently on the shoulder ED starts and

cries out Tt is a SLACK AMBULANCE DRIVER in a white eccat
bending over him

He helps ED to his feet Through the window is the ambulance
drawn up by the pumps ED shakes his head

ED

EXT BRIDGE AT AINTRY DAY

The AMBULANCE DRIVER and HIS ASSISTANT gently lift LEWIS

out of the canoe LEWIS groans or cries every time he is
moved They take him over to the ambulance BOBBY following
them making a token effort to help ED leans heavily
agsinst the ambulance

With LEWIS inside the DRIVER helps ED in too At this point
Highwey Patrol car drives up and stops its antenna
swishing TWO OFFICERS get out one of them a mean-looking
blonde boy

BLONDE-OFFICER
‘Whats going on here

ED catches BOBBYs eye through the open rear door of the
ambulance They exchanges a look which says This is it and
here goes BOBBY meets THE OFFICER as he gets out of

the car

BOBBY

pulls away as BOBBY leads the OFFICER over to inspect the
canoe

INT HOSPITAL DAY

ED is lying on the examining table of the emergency room
His flying suit is in a heap on the floor He wears only
his shorts his filthy tennis shoes and his improvised
bandage

The tight lines in EDs face are beginning to relex He has
an expression of perfect contentment He is luxuriating in
the safety and security of organised civilisation as
represented by the hospital He looks around at the
ordinary medical paraphernalia

ED
Its beautiful Beautiful

‘A DOCTOR has been scrubbing his hands in 9 basin He turns

now wiping them dry

DOCTOR

EXT BIDDIFORDS HOTEL EVENING

The ambulance is drawn up outside a large remshackle old
house with a sign over it saying Biddifords Hotel

THE DRIVER is helping ED out of the front seat He is back
in the ragged flying suit Through a tear in the side the
brilliant white of fresh bandages shows

DRIVER
Take it easy now

ED
Iwill TI will

A brisk aproned WOMAN of 60 opens the sereen door on the
sagging porch before he gets up the stevs

WOMAN
Come on in Youre expected

INT BIDDIFORDS EVENING

BOBBY is hovering behind the WOMAN chewing a mouthful of
food Beyond him is a dining room table round which sit
TWELVE OR FOURTEEN PEOPLE

They are all looking though at ED who stands in the lobby
looking rather limp

WOMAN -
You better eat just how you are
Ill bet you can use a hot meal

She leads him in and seats him BOBBY goes back to his
place The OTHER GUESTS have still not resumed eating or
talking They look at him with some awe

THE WOMAN piles up his plate and he puts a morsel to his
mouth It is like a sign There is a rush of talk and
clatter and laughter

They all eat again and everybody wants to pass ED something

to do something for him It is too much for him He begins ©

to ery - for Drew for his own pain but mostly in gratitude
for being welcomed back to the human race —

ED catches BOBBYs eye across the table and they exchenge
a look which is like ea thanksgiving

Then ED wipes his eyes on his sleeve and starts to eat in
earnest

posture for a prayer

BOBBY

INT TAXI DAY ‘

BOBBY and ED sit nervously on the edge of the seat in
their new anonymous clothes as the grimy cab hauls them
through Aintry The DRIVER throws off the odd bit of
information of local interest figuring them as tourists
BOBBY sitting right behind the DRIVER clenches his fists
like a jockey urging on a horse and mimes Come on

sleep

ED

voice of the recently
anethesised)
Never better

ED cannot think how to disguise his purpose from the

to communicate his anxiety to LEWIS who studies his
face closely ED glances at the PATROLMAN then clenches
‘ his mouth trying to show LEWIS he cannot talk in front
of the police Up the ward BOBBY is engaging THE OTHER

EXT RIVER BANK BELOW FINAL RAPIDS DAY

A miscellany of trucks jeeps pick-ups and two patrol cars
are drawn up on the river bank In the river a number of
MEN are dragging with grappling hooks and chains There
are quite a FEW SPECTATORS all enjoying the excitement

ED sits on the bank next to a PATROLMAN who is obviously
posted to watch him

Another patrol car arrives and BOBBY steps out of it ED
turns to watch and gets a momentary impression that BOBBY
is a prisoner

He is surrounded by POLICEME and OTHERS A PATROLMAN is
talking to him with some vehemence or appears to be

ONE MAN detaches himself from the GROUF around BOBBY He
is a small old light-bodied man He comes over to ED
with the same sideways kind of walk the two men had when
they came out of the trees

EXT RIVER AT AINTRY BRIDGE DAY

The light rain is mottling the river He gets out of the
car and looks at the canoe which has been pulled well up
on the bank and turned over Some muddy CHILDREN are
Playing near it

ED runs his hands up and down the battered hull It has
taken and terrific beating there are gouged out dents in
the metal and only streaky remnants of paint

EDs attenticn is attracted by some kind of activity
across the river Behind the trees and bushes he makes
out a cemetery

ED speaks to a little girl

ED
What is it A funeral

LITTLE GIRL
(in very nasal
country tones)
Naw Theyre gonna move them
people ‘fore they finish the dam
Theyre diggin them up

ED takes a closer look Now he can make out the stacked
coffins and the MEN moving among them Some kind of
mechanical digger is at work The CHILDREN scamper off
downstream leaving ED a very solitary figure

He looks down intently at the river perhaps to fix it in
his mind or maybe he expscts it to yleid up some secrat
an answer He looks back at the graveyard frowning TWO
MEN hump a coffin on their shoulders Suddenly tne rote
ting side of the coffin falls away They stop and try and
get a better hold but the bottom sags and then collapses
and their whole burden disintegrates They walk off un
concernedly and pick up another coffin which the mechanic
cal digger has gouged out of the ground

ED watches this scene with a puzzled look as though is
recalls a memory or is the echo of and forgotten dream
During this the first line of Duelling Banioes is heard
repeated over and over at first faintly then more stronge-
ly the banjo answering the guitar
