INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT - DURHAM NC 1

Cold opens to two cops driving in a police car Stark
dramatic feel like THE SHIELD Opening credits roll over the
scene The radio cackles alive

DISPATCHER (0S)
Attention all units attack in
progress at 742 Evergreen Terrace
Screaming woman heard from inside
the residence Respond Code 3

The cop driving picks up the CB unit and turns on the lights
and siren

COP 1

DISPATCHER
5430 additional person reporting

COP 1
Roger Keep the PR on the line Do

DISPATCHER

The cops look at each other ominously slam on the gas pedal

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 2

The car pulls to a stop and the cops jump out Loud guttural
female groaning and a crash from the apartment They check
the windows curtains are closed so they kick in the door

INT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 3

Cops bust in see a naked girl bent over a sofa arm being
fucked hard from behind by a naked guy Her arms are tied
together behind her back and he is holding them and spanking
her like a jockey A lamp is in pieces on the floor clothes
are strewn around the apartment They have their backs to the
door and her screams are so loud they don’t hear the cops

COP 1
STOP Get your hands up and move
away from the woman
COP 1 tackles the guy he screams in shock COP 2 pulls the
girl away and wraps his coat over her naked body

COP 2
Are you ok Miss

She grunts and tries moving her hands but can’t because they
are tied up COP 2 unties her ANGLE ON COP 1 his knee in
the back of the guy cuffing him

TUCKER
I have money in my wallet just
take it

COP 1

This is the police shut up and
stop resisting

TUCKER
WHAT Why are you hand-cuffing me

COP 1
Shut up Stop resisting

The cop secures the cuffs and takes out his Tazer
TUCKER
What is going on Why are you

arresting me

COP 1
Shut up This is your last warning

He points the tazer at Tucker who looks up in shock

TUCKER
DON’T TAZE ME BRO

COP 2 comes over tentatively and taps on COP 1’s shoulder

COP 2
Uhhey Partner you might want to
take a look at this

COP 1 turns to see the girl the policeman’s jacket barely
covering her furiously signing at him and making the grunty
noises deaf people make when they try to talk

COP 2 (CONT’D)
She’s deaf

COP 1
She’s what

The deaf girl gets in COP 1’s face and signs exaggeratedly
while also speaking in an unmodulated voice of a deaf person

DEAF GIRL
I AM DEAF

The expression on COP 1’s face goes from intense to confused

COP 2
We dont have a crime She says the
sex was consensual

DEAF GIRL
He wasn’t raping me he was fucking
me You know fucking

She points her finger at her crotch moving her hips back and
forth The three of them stand there for a beat

TUCKER
Now that we have that cleared up
you two think you could leave

DEAF GIRL
I was about to cum

Screen goes to black and the masthead appears
I HOPE THEY SERVE BEER IN HELL

Opening credits roll as

EXT LAW SCHOOL - DAY 4

TUCKER 24 handsome and self-possessed pulls his car into
the parking lot and gives the Guy Head Nod to a familiar
passer-by as he strides coolly into the law school

TUCKER
Ever fuck a deaf chick Of course
you havent

INT LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 5

In the common area of the law library a mixed group is
sitting around bullshitting instead of studying

FRIEND 1
(a girl)
I still can’t believe you’re
getting married Jeff

FRIEND 2
I can’t believe she said yes

The group laughs as we ANGLE on JEFF 24 a thick-necked ex-
high school athlete no one has ever accused of being a nerd

JEFF
Shit man I’m starting to regret
that she didn’t say no This
wedding planning stuff is nuts I
spent all night looking through
wedding magazines and books of
white flowers Just white

FRIEND 2
Jesus I hope I never have to get
married

ANGLE ON Tucker entering the library

JEFF
With your face I think you’re
safe

Tucker stands behind Jeff with a smile waiting for Jeff to
notice him while the friends at the table gawk at Jeff

JEFF (CONTD)
What

TUCKER
Raise your hand if you’ve ever
fucked a deaf girl

A beat Jeff whips around as Tucker smiles deviously and
slowly raises his hand The group bursts into hysterics

GROUP
Bullshit
No way
Deaf girls are hot
Lies

Can you hear me now

JEFF
You had sex with a deaf chick

TUCKER
Youre deaf too now

Tucker starts mock-signing

TUCKER (CONTD)
(in a mongoloid voice)
Yes Jeff I had sex with a deaf
girl

JEFF
Didn’t you hook up with a mute girl
last semester You’re 23 of the
way to a Helen Keller

INT LAW SCHOOL CLASSROOM - A LITTLE LATER 6

Jeff and Tucker are next to each other in an auditorium style
class Everyone has laptops open in front of them

TUCKER
I almost shit myself when those
cops busted in I thought she set
me up or something

JEFF
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna
do whatcha gonna do when you’re
fucking a deaf girl and the cops
come for you

The professor is perturbed with the talking in the back

PROFESSOR
Mr Max What is your take on this
issue
TUCKER
I’m sorry what issue is that
PROFESSOR
Are you not paying attention Mr
Max
TUCKER

I wasn’t I apologize I was busy
talking about having sex with a
deaf girl

The class laughs

PROFESSOR
Charmingand oddly appropriate
Do you or do you not feel that
Little People should be a protected
class

TUCKER
You mean midgets

PROFESSOR
Yes Mr Max if you must midgets
Do you think they should be
protected

TUCKER
What are we protecting them from
eagles and poachers and stuff Like
an endangered species

The class erupts again

JEFF
Poachers

TUCKER
It could happen You know if Kanye
showed up to a club in a midget
stoll they’d be extinct in a week

PROFESSOR
Mr Max if you didn’t do the
reading then

TUCKER
No I dont think midgets should be
considered a protected class for
the purposes of employment
discrimination law I think their
physical limitations put them
squarely within the business
necessity and reasonable
accommodation defenses of the
Americans with Disabilities Act

PROFESSOR
Where do you draw the line then

TUCKER
I’m not sure I figure it’s like
riding a roller coaster You must
be this high to get ADA protection

Tucker puts his hand at chest level and the class laughs

PROFESSOR
Very funny Mr Max What if I told
you that I just finished a pro bono
case involving a gentlemans club
that terminated the employment of a
dancer with dwarfism because she--
Tucker lurches forward in his seat

TUCKER
You represented a midget stripper
PROFESSOR
They prefer the term ‘Little
Person’
TUCKER

Was she fired

PROFESSOR
No they gave her her job back

Tucker has that mischievous twinkle in his eye

TUCKER
What club was it

PROFESSOR
Mr Max if you’re genuinely
interested in the case come to
office hours and I’1l1 fill you in
Until then let’s remember this is a
constitutional law class not Adult
Friend Finder

TUCKER
Touche I will shut up now

Aside to Jeff as Professor drones on about the

INT AARON’S APT - MINUTES LATER

case

The apartment is dark and spartan Aaron is slouched down in

the room’s only chair in front of a meticulously organized

media center playing a Grand Theft Auto-style game

Aaron is 24 tall and lanky with angular features He’s neat
almost finicky about his appearance but underneath he’s a
maladjusted beaten down Star Trek nerd He’s got a headset
on that is connected to his controller

AARON
I’m going down the alley to beat up
the hooker Watch my six
Aaron’s phone rings He puts his Bluetooth in his other ear
In SPLIT SCREEN Tucker barrels through city traffic Aarons
his digital doppelganger running down pedestrians on screen

as Tucker sends them running for cover in real life

TUCKER
Yo Aaron It’s Tucker

Aaron flips out and hits the video game controller furiously

AARON
What the hell is going on

Aaron’s car is getting shot up from behind
TUCKER
I’m coming to get you we’re going
drinking

Aaron’s character dies on the screen

AARON
What the hell YOU SUCK

TUCKER
What

AARON
Is this your idea of having my
back

TUCKER

This is a great idea I need a
drink and you need some daylight

AARON
What kind of wingman are you you
selfish little shit-for-brains
(MORE )

AARON (CONTD)
I should come over to your house
cut off your stubby virgin hands
and beat you to death with them
HotWheelz

INT AARON’S APT - CONTINUOUS 9

Aaron rips off both headsets hurls his controller and
storms into the kitchen

EXT STREETINT TUCKER’S CAR 10

Tucker pulls up to the curb in front of Aaron’ building

INT AARON’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 11
Aaron is standing against the counter eating cereal

AARON

Ahhhh Captain Crunch My old
friend

(baby talk)
You wouldnt leave me hanging in an
alley full of hookers I’m not
gonna catch you in the cupboard

EXT AARON’S APARTMENT - SIMULTANEOUS 12

A chair with “HERS” stenciled on the back and an over-flowing
box sit outside “HERS” has been crossed out and “WHORES”
written in Sharpie underneath “WHORE’S BELONGINGS” is
scrawled on the top of the box Tucker opens the lid
Something is written on the inside

TUCKER
(reading but to himself)
Take whatever you want her box is
apparently open to all

Tucker sifts through the box Han Solo and Princess Leia
figurines with their kung-fu grip hands melted together
women’s clothes pictures of a blissful Aaron and a striking
but disinterested brunette The box is peppered with unused
tampons that have been snapped in half

INT AARON’S APT - CONTINUOUS 13

Tucker barges in without knocking and opens all the drapes
flooding the dark depressive sanctuary of pain with light

TUCKER
Look at this place It’s a shrine
to cuckoldry and rage

Aaron plops down in his chair The back has “HIS” stenciled
into it matching the “HERS” outside

TUCKER (CONTD)
You ready

AARON
What are you babbling about

TUCKER
Were going to the bar I just told
you on the phone

AARON
I don’t pay attention to what you
say I just wait for you to stop
talking about yourself get bored
and hang up

AARON stares blankly ahead at the television

TUCKER
Did Sarah call yet

Tucker goes into the kitchen to get himself a chair and grabs
two beers from the fridge

AARON
No She probably has trouble
talking with a dick in her mouth

Tucker sets the chair down grabs the remote and stops on
the opening credits of Jem and the Holograms

TUCKER
This cartoon is disturbingly hot
Can you imagine a threesome with
Jem and Jerrica

AARON
I can imagine them both cheating on
me

TUCKER
Jerrica runs a foster home She
wouldn’t cheat

AARON
She voluntarily surrounds herself
with shattered little lives so her
dysfunctional existence feels more
normal You think she wouldn’t pull
her cartoon panties to the side for
the first guy who tells her she’s
pretty

Aaron waits in vain for Tucker to respond

AARON (CONTD)
Of course she would They all
would Even the foster kids those
validation seeking little sluts

Click Tucker changes the channel a DeBeers commercial
Aaron lurches forward jabbing his finger at the television

AARON (CONTD)
Im onto your game DeBeers-—
diamonds are almost worthless other
than the value attached to them by
the silly tramps youve brainwashed
into thinking “diamond equals
love” Guess what sluts your quest
for the perfect princess cut is
supporting terrorism and genocide
Congratulations your avarice has
managed to destroy an entire
continent

TUCKER
Sarah kept the ring

AARON
I hope you die in a fire

TUCKER
You act like you’re the first
person in the world to get cheated
on It happens to everyone dude
even me

AARON
Oh really Does everyone catch
their fiancee sucking off a rapper

INT SARAH’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - TWO WEEKS AGO 14

Aaron lets himself in with keys attached to an old tattered
Duke GI Joe keychain He’s carrying a box of Earl Grey tea
and a bag of throat lozenges

AARON
Hey honey how are you doing

Sarah is vigorously pumping her head in the crotch of
Grillionaire an iced-out white rapper He’s sloppily eating
a sandwich and using the remote when he spots Aaron

GRILLIONAIRE
WHAT IT DO BABY GRILLIONAIRE IN DA
HOUSE

SARAH jerks up and turns panicked to see Aaron just as he
slams the front door behind him

INT AARON’S LIVING ROOM - BACK TO CURRENT SCENE 15

TUCKER
Hey who knew blowjobs were good
for sore throats right

AARON
The most rewarding part of our
friendship is your ability to find
personal amusement in the
destruction of my life

TUCKER
It’s not that bad dude You always
get stuck in these cycles When you
get depressed like this you need
to ask yourself What would Tucker
do and then go do that

AARON
I already know what you would do
and I have no desire to get HIV
from one of the cum dumpsters into
whom you shoot your emotional pain
every weekend

TUCKER
You know HIV is basically curable
now It doesn’t even show up in
Magic Johnsons blood anymore

AARON
You’re telling me that Magic
Johnson is black AND has AIDSand
he has it better than me

INT CAMPUS BAR - AN HOUR LATER 16

Campus Bar is part sports bar part dingy hook-up dungeon
Tucker is flirting aggressively with Leslie a gorgeous co-ed
waitress Aaron disgusted is staring off at the TV

LESLIE
I love kids When I graduate I want
to work with children and have a
bunch of my own What about you

TUCKER
Are you kidding I love kids too I
can’t wait to have more

LESLIE
(shocked)
You have kids

TUCKER
No I’m just playing

AARON
He does they’re just all in the
compost heap behind Planned
Parenthood

Leslie doesn’t know whether to be creeped out or disgusted

TUCKER
(boyishly charming)
If you do stem cell research you
could work with them

She tries not to laugh but can’t help herself Jeff breezes
in and sidles up Tucker swats Leslie on the ass

TUCKER (CONT’D)
Run along baby man talk I have
your number I’11 call you

Leslie walks away clearly smitten Aaron shakes his head

AARON
Who says romance is dead

JEFF
How can you be angry at women yet
at the same time be mad at the
things Tucker does

AARON
I’m like a feminist I can assert
multiple contradictory positions

Tucker scoffs The bartender was eavesdropping and breaks in

CAMPUS BARTENDER
(to Tucker)
Hey listen bro can you do me a
favor and not talk to my server
like that It’s disrespectful

TUCKER
Excuse me

CAMPUS BARTENDER
I think you heard me

TUCKER
Oh I heard you Hero You don’t
want me flirting with your server
I didn’t know she belonged to you
I thought she was an individual
with free will

CAMPUS BARTENDER
It’s a figure of speech bro

TUCKER
Well BRO here’s another figure of
speech for you Mind your own
fucking business I’m sorry I’ve
accomplished more in 30 minutes
with Leslie than you have in two
years but she looked pretty happy
talking to me Or maybe she rubs
her crotch against all the
customers

CAMPUS BARTENDER
I think it might be time for you to
leave

TUCKER
Or maybe it’s just time for you to
get me another drink

Tucker waves his empty glass

CAMPUS BARTENDER
I don’t think so

Leslie passes by with a full drink tray Tucker makes eye
contact and motions her over pulling her into him with his
arm around her waist He plucks a beer from her tray

TUCKER
Hey sweetie just put this on my
tab okay

Tucker disarms her with charm and she gives it up easily The
bartender sees this transpire and seethes

LESLIE
(to Campus Bartender)
Sam could you get me another beer
for table six

The bartender lifts the bar door and postures up Jeff slides
in behind Tucker who turns away unconcerned

JEFF
(calmly but assertively)
I will have what he’s having Thank
you

Jeff locks eyes intimidatingly with the bartender who
considers his options and relents

TUCKER
Listen I know everything is set
for tonight but I think we should
discuss a potential change in venue
for your bachelor party

AARON
Oh this should be good

TUCKER
The strip club we’re supposed to go
to sucks It’s dirty and decrepit
and the girls that don’t have
stretch marks have personalities
like the worst parts of the Bible

AARON
Personalities We have to talk to
them

TUCKER

Some of us actually enjoy the
company of women Aaron

AARON
Yeah I’m the misogynist here

TUCKER
It wouldn’t be so bad if Durham
hadnt passed that ridiculous ‘no
touch’ ordinance All we can do is
sit at a table and look at them

JEFF
I thought you said they were
disgusting Why would we want to
touch them

TUCKER
What do you want to do Jeff play
checkers This is a fucking
BACHELOR PARTY

JEFF
Well what did you have in mind

TUCKER
A short two hour drive away is a
strip club called Baby Dolls I’m
sorry Let me back up This isn’t
just some strip club This is the
Super Bowl of carnal pleasure

AARON
We’ve been to strip clubs before

TUCKER

Not like this one dude The first
time I got a lap dance there the
stripper grabbed my hands and put
them on her tits The second dance
she turned around and basically dry
humped me the entire time She was
gorgeous and wasnt even close to
being the best one there

AARON
I used to think there was a bright
line between a gentlemans club and
a brothel Now youre telling me
its just gray

JEFF
You can full-on grab their breasts
and they don’t care

TUCKER
They encourage it

AARON
I bet they had good childhoods

TUCKER
And the very best part 5 cover
10 dances 2 drinks All Night

AARON
I’d rather fellate a hot curling
iron than drive 150 miles because
Tucker breast fed until he was
eight

JEFF
I can’t leave Tomorrow we have a
bunch of meetings and stuff to take
care of Seating chart and whatnot

TUCKER
Seating chart

AARON
I’m sure Kristy can cut that
Gordian knot

JEFF
It’s not that simple

TUCKER
Yes it is It’s an LSAT logic game
A table seats 8 people Tucker must
sit next to a single woman with
large breasts Aaron must not sit
next to anyone with a vagina No
one else matters Boom done

JEFF
The wedding is next weekend man
I’m not just going to leave Kristy
hanging because of some stupid no-
touch policy That’s your issue
not mine

TUCKER
Well be back tomorrow afternoon
Look dude if we stay in Durham we
can’t have the experience we need
to make up for that abomination of
an engagement party you had with
Kristy’s family

INT SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - BASEMENT - FLASHBACK 17

Nicely-dressed people sit around folding tables in a basement
Sunday School room A sign taped to a wall “CONGRATULATIONS
JEFF AND KRISTY MAY JESUS BLESS YOUR HOLY MATRIMONY”

Jeffs at a table between Kristy’s father Mr Jorgens and
Kristy’s brothers They have that foppish swoop of hair
hanging down over their brows like young Southern men you
want to punch in the head

MR JORGENS
I’m glad you’re having a good time
son I was worried those godless
usurious law school friends of
yours might lead you astray

JEFF
No sir

MR JORGENS
I’m sure they would rather be out
drankin’ and fornicatin’

JEFF
Probably sir

ANGLE ON Mrs Jorgens Kristy’s mother leading bible bingo

school probably about a job
interview Hello

ANGLE ON Tucker Aaron and Kristy at a table in the back of
the room Tucker has the phone tilted out so they can hear
TUCKER
Having a great time back here This
is definitely better than getting
drunk with strippers

ANGLE ON Mrs Jorgens

MRS JORGENS
From the sole of your foot to the
top of your head there is no
soundness- only wounds and welts
and open sores Hugh honey who
does that sound like

ANGLE ON Jeff as Mr Jorgens talks to his sons sitting next

to Jeff

JEFF
Tomorrow morning Sure I can make
that

MR JORGENS
Of course that’s who Isaiah’s
talking about The open sores are
from having their horns and tails
cut off so they can blend in with
the humans

SPLIT SCREEN with Jeff and Tucker Aaron and Kristy

TUCKER
Hey Jeff does Daddy know his
little girl likes anal

KRISTY
Tucker Shut up My mom has hearing
like a vampire bat

JEFF
I’m not in a position to answer
that at this time

TUCKER
Fuck it I think I’m just going to
order some strippers

AARON
Make them papists and have them
give us communion It’ll set this
congregation ablaze

men

JEFF
Yeah I guess

TUCKER
And what about Aaron

AARON
Don’t drag me into this There’s a
Next Generation marathon this
weekend I am just fine lusting
after Deanna Troy and stewing in my
cocoon of loneliness and anger

TUCKER
He hasn’t been out of the house
since his girl tore out his heart
and stomped it with bling shoes
Aaron needs this

JEFF
You do need this

AARON
I need this like I need hepatitis
Cc

TUCKER
You need this WE ALL NEED THIS
IT’S OUR DESTINY AS MEN

JEFF
Yeah you’re right man I’m in

Kristy strains a smile

JEFF

KRISTY

JEFF
Tomorrow You know shes only
coming early so she can take
control of everything

KRISTY
No she’s not Quit being dramatic

JEFF
If she has her way the reception
will be a potluck in a barn

KRISTY
She’s pious and conservative Jeff
not Pennsylvania Dutch

JEFF
Well probably have to churn our
own butter for the dinner rolls

KRISTY
My parents are paying for the
wedding My mom’s entitled to have
some input What did you want me to
say to her Dont come

JEFF
That would be a start I’1ll be
goddamned if I let her ruin our
wedding It’s my day too ya know

KRISTY
Calm down Groomzilla

JEFF
Dont Groomzilla me Those squirrel
hunters wouldnt know a good time

shirts off the back of a chair

KRISTY

JEFF
Packing

KRISTY
For what

JEFF

I’m going to Charlotte with Tucker
and Aaron for my bachelor party

KRISTY

JEFF
Change of plans Tucker knows about
a great strip club down there

KRISTY
Good for Tucker I hope he has a
great time

JEFF
You know I can’t let him go off by
himself That’s when the really bad
stuff happens He needs me to have
his back

KRISTY
Who’s got your back Aaron

JEFF
Tucker’s got my back

KRISTY
Tucker says he’s got your back
Except you’re always the one
bailing him out I wish you took
care of me as well as you take care
of Tucker

JEFF
That’s a bunch of crap I always
look out for you You’re my number
one priority

KRISTY
Really When have I taken
precedence When have you chosen me
over Tucker Give me an example
Just one

JEFF
I’m marrying you aren’t I

Kristy looks incredulously at Jeff He tries to salvage some
credibility before it’s too late

JEFF (CONTD)
You just don’t want me going to a
strip club with Tucker

KRISTY
Honey you know I’m cool with you
going to a strip club If we didn’t
have so much to do I’d go with
you But we have all the final
appointments this weekend You need
to be there

JEFF
Why do I even need to go now It’s
going to be two against one the
whole time anyway

KRISTY
That’s not true Your input is
important

JEFF
I didn’t get a say when the Locust
Queen decided to swarm in early
Why should this be any different

KRISTY
So instead you’re going to pout and
play babysitter to Tucker Again

22 INT TUCKER’S CAR - CURBSIDE - SIMULTANEOUS 22

TUCKER
What’s taking him long

AARON
He’s talking to a woman Anything
is possible

TUCKER
Should I go help

AARON
There is a zero percent chance that
injecting you into this situation
will make it better

TUCKER
I’m going in

Tucker bursts from the car and jogs toward Jeffs place

AARON
(shouting out the window)
Bring me back a Gatorade

INT JEFF’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 23

JEFF
COMPROMISE Thats all Ive been
doing Your dad didnt want a
bachelor party with strippers and
booze so I said fine well do an
engagement party at the church I
want a beach ceremony
imitating Mrs Jorgens)
No sir were having it in church
under the watchful eye of the Lord
in his normal voice)
and I said okay I want a bouncy
castle at the reception
imitating Mrs Jorgens)
Bouncy castles are childish and
dangerous Grow up
in his normal voice)
So I gave in because I didnt want
to argue Its just a stupid bouncy
castle The only thing Ive been
able to keep so far is the open
bar and now shes probably going
to take that too and you aren’t
going to do a thing to stop her

KRISTY
No one said you had to give in on
that stuff Be a man and take a
stand if it’s important to you

JEFF
You want me to be a man and take a
stand Here it is I’m going to
Charlotte with Tucker and I don’t
give a fuck what you or the Wicked
Witch of West Texas think about it

Tucker walks in without knocking

TUCKER
What’s up guys

Kristy tries to put on her “Everything is fine” face

KRISTY
So what’s this I hear about you
taking Jeff for the weekend

TUCKER
Well Durham passed this stupid no-
touch rule I figure since the
ladies can’t seem to keep their
hands off me it’d be irresponsible
for me to go to clubs around here

KRISTY
How thoughtful of you

TUCKER
You don’t mind do you I’m not
stepping on any toes am I

Kristy gives him that “wellactually” look

KRISTY
It’s just we have all the final
wedding appointments tomorrow and--

TUCKER
Oh no Jeff didn’t say anything
about that Why didn’t you tell me
dude That’s not cool It’s your
wedding man

Jeff is wide-eyed at Tucker in frustration and anger

TUCKER (CONTD)

TUCKER (CONTD)

KRISTY

Tucker grabs Jeffs duffel from him and gives it to Kristy

TUCKER
(to Kristy)
He doesn’t need this anymore
(to Jeff)
You ready dude

Jeff nods

TUCKER (CONTD)

Tucker and Jeff walk toward the car parked at the curb

TUCKER

TUCKER
Come on dude do you really think

something I want

They reach the car and open their doors to get it

TUCKER (CONTD)
The more important question is ARE
YOU READY TO GET SHIT-FACED AND
GRAB SOME TITTIES

Tucker gets in and tries to hi-five Aaron who ignores him

25 EXTINT TUCKER’S CAR - FREEWAY - AN HOUR LATER 25

Tucker’s ebullient Jeff has a searching purposeful stare
Aaron looks bitter and disaffected

AARON
We need to stop for food My blood
sugar is getting low

JEFF
Here’s what I don’t get why did
you lie to her

(MORE )

JEFF (CONTD)
You know I hate lying to Kristy
It’s not like I wasn’t gonna go

anyway

Tucker fiddles with a GPS unit in the dash browsing for
nearby food options

TUCKER
Oh please When I walked in you had
so much surrender in your eyes I
thought your apartment was Vichy
France

They pass a sign for among other things McDonalds

AARON
If I don’t get a McGriddle soon I
am going to call the authorities
and have them arrest you both for
kidnapping and conspiracy

TUCKER
I don’t know how you eat
McGriddles They look disgusting

AARON
I can only assume from your
cavalier attitude that you have yet
to partake of the wonderment that
is the McGriddle Let me enlighten
you

26 INT MCDONALDS TASTER KITCHEN 26

People in white lab coats are putting chemicals on processed
breakfast foods Everything is painted red and yellow

AARON (VO)

What happens is the One True God
grows McGriddles on trees in the
Elysian Fields with a heretofore
unused incantation

27 INT TUCKER’S CAR - FREEWAY 27

AARON
He then proceeds to magic them down
to your local eatery

INT MCDONALDS RESTAURANT KITCHEN 28

A wretched looking McDonalds employee hastily slaps a wrapper
on a McGriddle and fires it down the metal holding chute

AARON (VO)
Where whatever societal reject
McDonalds has rescued off the dole
that week gently wraps them in
cellophane and passes them along to
you the fortunate consumer

INT TUCKER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 29

AARON
You proceed to ingest this finery
in the vain hope that your
obviously overmatched taste buds
can somehow grasp the delectable
intricacies that face them

INT MCDONALDS KITCHEN 30

A dirty fry cook pours some watery yellow mixture into a
mold and tosses it in a microwave He pulls a couple strips
of something from a box labeled “Fa-con” and slaps a slice of
pale waxy “cheese” on top of it

AARON (VO)

Is that egg Why yes it is and
bacon too But wait--they didnt
addyes they did they did
indeed They added cheese

The fry cook dunks an english muffin into a giant open tub of
maple syrup He pulls the english muffin out and accidentally
drops it on the floor He quickly brushes off the larger
debris from the floor and slaps the egg cheese and fa-cony
concoction between the two sides of the english muffin

AARON (VO) (CONTD)
And then then my friend they
wrapped it in a sumptuous pancake
bun As your taste buds try to
process that amazing piece of
information

INT TUCKER’S CAR 31

Aaron surrounded by McGriddle detritus in the backseat
takes a large orgasmic bite from a sandwich that looks like
it was smushed into a ball and dropped into a lint trap

AARON (VO)
It hits them The syrup nugget The
motherfucking syrup nugget It
announces itself with a burst of
confectionery grandiosity the likes
of which your palate has never
seen

INT TUCKER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 32

TUCKER
So you like them

AARON
Allow me to phrase it another way

INT TUCKER’S APARTMENT - DREAM SCENE 33

Aaron is dressed like a ninja with a McGriddle in one hand
He sneaks up on Tucker and in one fluid motion whips the
wrapper off the McGriddle crams it in Tucker’s mouth places
the wrapper around his penis and humps Tucker from behind
before punching him violently at the base of his skull

AARON (VO)
If you ever speak ill of the
McGriddle again I will personally
come to your home and force-feed
you one while I fuck you in the
butt with the wrapper as a condom
and then donkey punch you when the
infused syrup nugget explodes

INT TUCKER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 34

TUCKER
You are so fucking weird

Tucker veers onto a freeway off ramp with a tall McDonalds
sign looming up ahead

EXT TUCKER’S CAR - CHARLOTTE NC - EARLY EVENING 35

They drive through bar-lined downtown streets Gorgeous women
in slutty clothes clog the sidewalks

INT TUCKER’S CAR 36

Heads on a swivel Tucker rolls up the windows and child
locks them McDonalds wrappers line the floor boards

JEFF
Who farted

TUCKER
I don’t sm--

AARON
Oh my God

Tucker bursts into hysterics as both Aaron and Jeff futilely
hit the down buttons on their windows

AARON (CONTD)
What is wrong with you It smells
like you got buttfucked by a
garbage truck

TUCKER
Hey McDonalds was your idea

AARON
DO NOT DISPARAGE THE MCGRIDDLE

JEFF
Open the fucking window

TUCKER
That’s some fermented ass juice
youre smelling right there

AARON
Where are my law books This has to
count as a felony battery

They come to a red light he unlocks the windows and they
stick their heads out like dogs Tucker points to a trio of
overly made up Southern girls at the corner

TUCKER
You guys have such weak
constitutions

(MORE )

TUCKER (CONTD)
I bet those girls over there
wouldn’t complain as much as you
two

AARON
Of course they wouldn’t They’re
hookers They subject themselves to
anything for the right price

TUCKER
Not every woman on the street is a
whore dude Watch I’1l1 prove it

Tucker leans out the window

TUCKER (CONT’D)
Excuse me Miss How much for sex

She is repulsed

TUCKER (CONT’D)
See she only fucks for free

JEFF
Tucker where are we going Where’s
the strip club

TUCKER
Dude it’s not even seven The club
doesn’t open til ten Let’s get

AARON
Wonderful Now I can hate all these

baselessly judging them from inside
this metal fart coffin

EXT TAVERN - EVENING - MINUTES LATER

TUCKER
This place is sweet Last time I
was here it was wall to wall hot
girls

INT TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

The guys walk in and stop dead in their tracks It’s dead
except for a shit-housed party of unattractive middle aged
women and bits of birthday cake strewn everywhere

JEFF
Yeah this place is crawling with
trim Shame I’m taken

AARON
It looks like Jenny Craig and Lane
Bryant had a knife fight in here

A bouncer approaches them

BOUNCER

Ten dollar cover tonight guys
TUCKER

Yeah right
AARON

I will pay you ten dollars if we
can leave and pretend none of this
ever happened

The bouncer softens a touch

BOUNCER
Look dude I wouldn’t be here
either if I wasn’t getting paid
Just go to Whiskey Bar Everyone’s
there tonight

INT WHISKEY BAR —- EVENING - MINUTES LATER 39

The three walk into a crowded yuppie bar It is the polar
opposite of the earlier place

JEFF
Much better Now this is what I
call a target rich environment

AARON
I agree I want to shoot every
single one of these bitches

TUCKER
Alright fellas we have a little
over two hours until Baby Dolls
opens Lets see if we cant get
some girls to go with us

AARON
You want to pick up sluts and take
them to go see whores

TUCKER
If things go well

They walk up the bar and angle to get the bartender’s
attention Aaron nudges a fratty guy who’s talking to a girl

FH

AARON
Excuse me

FRATTY
Yo we were here first bro

AARON
So were the Indians A lot of good
it did them

FRATTY
What’d you call me

TUCKER
He called you an idiot

FRATTY
Fuck you dick

Fratty sticks his finger in Tucker’s chest Instead of
reacting to that Tucker sees the girl Fratty was talking to

TUCKER
Are you on a date with this guy

She nods

TUCKER (CONTD)
Has he bragged about the kind of
car he drives Let me guess a 3-
series I bet he’s hinted at least
twice at how much money he makes
Right

She doesn’t say anything which says everything

TUCKER (CONTD)
Awesome How many times has he
mentioned that he works out Did he
tell you about his gym and offer
you personal training Don’t you
love 30000 Millionaires

AARON
(to Fratty)
Be honest how many shirtless pics
do you have on your Myspace page

A beat The sorostitute giggles at Fratty

TUCKER
It’s a lot harder to pick up women
when you have to offer something
besides frat letters and GHB isn’t
it I bet you even have one of
those stupid frat rat names like
Chance or Reed

FRATTY
My name is Logan

Everyone laughs even the sorostitute Fratty is defeated

TUCKER
Should’ve moved when you had the
chance huh tough guy

Fratty gets visibly angry and two-hand pushes Tucker in the
chest In a flash Jeff has Fratty in a rear naked choke and
puts him out Bouncers who saw the whole thing transpire
come over and drag an unconscious Fratty away

TUCKER (CONTD)
(to the girl)
There goes your ride

In the background the bartender sets up five pint glasses
half full with light beer in pyramid He fills six shot
glasses with Amaretto and a Bacardi 151 float and sets them
on the lips of the glasses The bartender takes a huge swig
of Bacardi 151 puts a lighter up to his face and blows a
massive fireball over the shot glasses He hits one of the
shot glasses into the beer starting a domino effect that
puts out the flames and fizzes up the beer in each glass The
five bachelorette girls Melissa Christina Amy Ashley and
Mary grab a glass and chug

TUCKER (CONTD)
What is that

CHRISTINA
It’s called a Flaming Dr Pepper

TUCKER
Do it again

The bartender sets up three for the guys and they chug them
TUCKER (CONTD)
Holy shit It tastes like Dr
Pepper

FLAMING BARTENDER
Hence the name

TUCKER
Do it again Seven of them

AARON
And with less sarcasm this time

The bartender starts to set up the round Tucker turns to the
bachelorette party

TUCKER
OK if this is a real bachelorette
party who is the designated slut

All the girls laugh except Mary

MARY
Ugh None of us are sluts

TUCKER
That’s funny normally the
designated cock-blocker is the fat
one

The bartender sets up the shots for everyone

TUCKER (CONTD)
I think a toast is in order for my
buddy Jeff who is also getting
married and to the bride to be and
all her beautiful friends Even the
bitchy prude

He raises his glass

TUCKER (CONT’D)

TUCKER
Oh look another girl who ran away

cockblocking curmudgeon stop and
ask yourself What Would Tucker Do
and then do that instead

AARON
Finebut we can’t both go after
the girl with the lowest self
esteem

Melissa walks up semi-drunkenly and sidles up to Tucker

big fake tits and a naughty come hither look Christina She
smiles and comes over

She points to Aaron

TUCKER
Yeah Go talk to him for five

of piss and vinegar like you guys

AARON

Tucker thrusts a shot under Jeff’s nose and he does it

JEFF (CONTD)
Aaronll whisper his answer to me

Ashley seems to think this makes sense and whispers into
Jeffs ear Aaron leans in and Jeff looks at him quizzically

TUCKER
No it isn’t If I said that women

MARY
Excuse me

TUCKER

pageant girl ass would know the
difference

MARY
Fine youre sexist and misogynist

AARON

sloshing her wine and ashing her cigarette on the sofa

No why would I know that

AARON
You said you did

TUCKER

JEFF

The joke at Tucker’s expense disarms the girls who chuckle
as he comes over to see what the hold up is

TUCKER
Oh Well I can’t be held
accountable for the things that
come out of my mouth

A homeless STREET MUSICIAN near them starts playing Friends
in Low Places as Jeff gets on the phone Tucker puts his arm
around him and joins in

TUCKER (CONTD)
CAUUUUSE I GOT FRIENDS IN LOW
PLACES WHERE THE WHISKEY DROWNS
AND AARON CHASES GIRLS AWAYAND

The musician stops because Tucker screwed up the lyrics

STREET MUSICIAN
Those aren’t the words man

AARON
We will not be contradicted by a
man who works out of a hat

STREET MUSICIAN
Hey man do you like have any
change man

AARON
Tell you what I’ll give you all my
change if you give me that can of
beer in your pocket

Jeff approaches frustrated with the phone to his ear as the
street musician hands the beer to Aaron

STREET MUSICIAN
OK man Here you go

AARON
Unfortunately I dont have any
change but thanks for the beer

JEFF
(hand over mouthpiece)
Hey do you know where this fucking

He motions toward Aaron as Jeff snaps his phone shut

JEFF
Aaron Give it back There’s beer
at the club It’s cold even

Aaron hesitates holding the can of beer triumphantly

AARON
I’m not gonna drink it It’s
symbolic of my victory over him

TUCKER
He’s a homeless street musician He
already lost

AARON
And do you think that perhaps his
poor negotiation skills have
something to do with that Hmmmm

Jeff rips the beer out of Aaron’s hand and gives it back

JEFF
Sorry about that

STREET MUSICIAN
Thanks The club’s straight down
the street like a mile or two

A beat as he looks at the trio expectantly

Rape isn’t funny
AARON
What if the rapist is a mime or a

Shriner
Stripper 1 gives him a look

AARON (CONTD)
OK fine rape isn’t funny but
murder can be

STRIPPER 1
Murder isn’t funny either

AARON
Maybe not to you but if the
murderer was a clown that would be
funny to me

STRIPPER 1
How is that funny

AARON
Because he is happy on the outside
but sad on the inside

STRIPPER 1

Stripper 1 gets up and leaves Tucker shoots a look at Aaron
STRIPPER 2
(to Jeff)

Whats wrong with him

JEFF
He went through a bad break-up

TUCKER
You have a friend for him

STRIPPER 2
My friends would never put up with
this kind of abuse

Incredulous Aaron laughs in her face and makes a “T” with
his hands over his head

AARON
Okay I’m going to call a timeout
here so the lesser comedians in
the room have a chance to come up
with their own stripper abuse joke

Stripper 2 tries to respond Aaron puts a finger to her lips

TUCKER (CONTD)
Holy Christ what is that

LIZ

LIZ
It’s cognac and Alize We call it
“Thug Passion”

Each of them immediately reaches for their waters Lara the
stripper who was just on stage passes their table on her
way ostensibly to the dressing room

LARA
Are you guys drinking water We
don’t allow Mormons in here

AARON
It’s “Thug Passion” What mom put
in your bottle so she could watch
Young and The Restless in peace

LARA
My mom used bourbon all the sugar
in cognac made me hyper Whatd
your mom use

AARON
I didn’t get the bottle

LARA
That’s not too surprising Judging
by the distance between your eyes
it looks like she drank it all
while you were still in the womb

Aaron stammers over a comeback and falls silent Tucker and
Jeff stare at each other

TUCKER
Did she just make a fetal alcohol
joke

Tucker hands her a twenty dollar bill

TUCKER (CONTD)
When you are done changing or
whatever come back over and keep
talking shit to him Bring a friend
for the bachelor too

Lara smiles and makes for the back of the house Tucker turns
his attention to the hot stripper that has come over to him

JADE
If we get a champagne room we can
do anything we want

TUCKER
If we go back to my hotel room we
can do anything we want too

JADE
But then I don’t make any money

Tucker pauses and contemplates this offer

TUCKER
Ill give you twenty dollars

JADE
(laughing)
No Its four hundred baby But

for three fifty

TUCKER
Twenty five

JADE
Three hundred twenty five

TUCKER

TUCKER
My attention span won’t last an
hour Thirty dollars

JADE

TUCKER
That’s OK I’m already drunk

ANGLE ON Lara coming over and sitting down next to Aaron and
another girl sitting next to Jeff who he summarily ignores

AARON
If you must know my parents yelled
at me sent me to my room and
ignored me

LARA
If I was your mom I would have
locked you away and ignored you
too
AARON
If you were my mom I would’ve been
raised by a talentless hooker
instead of a nagging shrew There’s
a lose-lose

LARA
Youre awfully bitter for a pasty-
faced shut in Have you always been
this mean or did some girl trade
you in for a better model

JEFF
Yes you’re right His girl did
dump him

TUCKER

For Grillionaire of all people

LARA
Grillionaire Like “What it do

diamonds in his teeth Oh wow She
couldn’t even pick a good white
rapper like Paul Wall

AARON
She may be a vacuous slut with no
taste but at least she’s nota
stripper

LARA
You think you’re so clever I know
a hundred insecure assholes just
like you

AARON
I’m sure your mother’s boyfriends
were all great guys

LARA
If I had a dollar for every time I
heard a broken home joke I’d have
enough to buy ComiCon tickets for
you and all the other orc mage
failures on your buddy list
Whatever I have to go

Lara gets up quickly and walks toward the dressing room

TUCKER
No no no you can’t go

JEFF
(in Mortal Combat voice)
Finish him

Tucker and Jeff pop up and chase her down

LARA
I’ve really gotta get home soon
TUCKER
You need to keep talking shit to

JEFF

He can’t handle it when a woman
gets the best of him

LARA
I know And I’ve learned my lesson

LARA

JEFF

LARA
He was a famous Mexican
intellectual

AARON

LARA
No funnier than you catching your

Oooh body blow body blow body

JEFF
You like Mike Tyson Punch Out

AARON

LARA
I liked Soda Popinski because he’s
drinking a Forty in his picture

Tucker leans into Aaron and says in a bar whisper

TUCKER
This is your dream girl If you
don’t make this happen you will be
a disgrace to the entire GTA
playing community

Lara hears the mention of the GTA video game

LARA
Oh I will destroy you in GTA

AARON
Of course you will And you’re an
‘exotic dancer’ not a ‘stripper’

LARA
You can’t handle a girl whos
better than you at a stupid game

AARON
You can beat me at GTA Hey while
were in this fantasy land why
don’t we drive your flying car over
to the bank and get you approved
for a low-interest home loan

TUCKER
I bet you a hundred dollars that
she will beat you at GTA

AARON
I’m not betting on a video game
Betting is illegal

Lara leans in close to Aaron and sniffs him

LARA
I smell a pussy

AARON
Well then douche before work

TUCKER
Two hundred dollars

AARON
I can’t leave Jeffs bachelor
party is the whole reason we came

JEFF
Don’t let me keep you here Nothing
would make me happier than to see
you lose to her at a video game

AARON
I might consider it if we hada
place to play and I had my special
controller

LARA
My shift just ended We can play at
my house I have everything but
your candy ass little controller

JEFF
Then it’s a bet

AARON
I’m not going to some vile stripper
den You know her baby daddy is
just waiting for me to walk through
the front door so he can roll me
and steal my organs

LARA
How are you friends with this guy

JEFF
I have no idea How are you still
attracted to him

AARON
Probably has something to do with
the happy confluence of my
sarcastic standoffish sense of
humor and the inability of her step-
fathers to show her any affection

Jeffs phone rings

JEFF
Hey honey whats up

ANGLE on Tucker addressing Aaron

TUCKER

No It’s just a strong name I

Lara catches herself and shoots a quick glance at Aaron who
knows exactly why she cut herself off

AARON

shocked Having a kid is one of the
top three excuses women use to
justify stripping

LARA

Shy like the typical 7 year old boy Jack keeps his eyes
focused on his toys and nods to Aaron in the affirmative

jeopardizes the efficacy of your

tactics

JACK
But Optimus Prime has a big cool
gun

AARON

OK well work with it What are

AARON
I usually want to kick most kids
into a wood chipper No what the
How is that whore kicking my ass
Are you playing the hooker That’s
not possible

Aaron’s character just got heel-stomped in the nuts

LARA
That means a lot He’s had a tough
time since his dad left It’s a
secret cheat code this girl ona
gaming messageboard developed

AARON
Why did he leave Get off of me

Lara’s character is stealing Aaron’s character’s wallet

He thought I was cheating on him
so he decided to “get even” and
screw anything that moved

surprise me Your entire gender is
hard-wired for whoredom
Sonuvabitch that’s my head

Lara’s character has stolen Aaron’s character’s car and
backing over his head with it

LARA
I hate when men randomly bash
women It’s like this pathetic
defense mechanism you guys put up
when you know you are attracted to
a woman who might not be into you

AARON
That’s not true

LARA
Yes it is It’s easier to call a
girl a whore than admit to yourself
that she’s out of your league

AARON
That’s some whore logic if I’ve
ever heard it

LARA
Anyone is capable of being a whore
Aaron Being a woman does not de
facto make you one

AARON
It does if you’re a cum-guzzling
demon slut

LARA
Fine but your ex is only
representative of herself not her
whole gender Her actions don’t
mean that I am a whore simply
because we’re both women

AARON
So did you cheat Let me guess if
youre getting paid it “doesn’t
count”

LARA
No Aaron I’ve never cheated on
anyone Or used sex aS a weapon

Lara’s character hops out of the car and snuffs out the last
bits of Aaron’s life by smothering him with her breasts

INT BUS - AFTERNOON 78

Jeff disheveled and disfigured sits cramped against the
window of a Greyhound bus packed in like sardines amidst a
collection of broken souls who can only be described as the
dingleberries in the ass crack of humanity

INT JEFF’S APARTMENT - EVENING 79

Kristy and her mother are finalizing the seating chart and
writing out the place cards

KRISTY’S MOTHER
I’1l tell you one thing No good
Baptist would be caught dead
drinking to excess or gettin’
arrested for causin’ a ruckus It’s
unseemly

KRISTY
Of course not Mom The good
Baptists never get caught

A fiddling keys sound comes from the front door

KRISTY’S MOTHER
Look all I’m tryin’ to say is that
this kind of wanton drunkenness and
lack of self control is typical of
a religion with all of the
spirituality and none of the guilt
It’s not right

Jeff straggles through the door into the living room

KRISTY’S MOTHER (CONTD)
(biting and sarcastic)
Well look who the Lord has chosen
to deliver unto this happy home

H

FH HF

KRISTY
(to Jeff)
We need to talk You missed
everything

JEFF
I know

Kristy’s mother catches a glimpse of Jeffs face

KRISTY’S MOTHER
Oh my gracious Jeffrey Your face

Kristy leaps to her feet

KRISTY
Honey What happened to you

JEFF
(beaten and defeated)
I’m so so sorry

KRISTY’S MOTHER
Sorry The wedding’s ruined Look
at your face

KRISTY
Enough mom

KRISTY’S MOTHER
We have to postpone I can’t
display your wedding photos in my
house what will people think

KRISTY
I said enough This isn’t about
you I don’t care what you do with
the stupid pictures

A beat as Kristy’s mother regroups and Jeff looks on sullen
and hilariously disfigured

KRISTY (CONTD)
Are you okay You have to stop
letting Tucker get you into these
messes

Jeff shrugs frowning and droopy

KRISTY (CONTD)
(through stifled laughter)
Oh my little Quasimoto You look so
pathetic

She hugs him tenderly as much like a mother as a wife

KRISTY (CONTD)
Let’s get you cleaned up so I can
stop laughing at you

INT LAW LIBRARY - MORNING
SUPERSCRIPT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING
Tucker walks into the law library and sits with Aaron

TUCKER
Dude I just tried to take a shit
Nothing would come out That never
happens to me I feel like Elvis
just before his heart exploded

AARON
If only the world were so lucky

TUCKER
Whatever You wanna play some ball

AARON
I have class You know that place
we pay 35 grand a year to go to
between happy hours

TUCKER
That place is dumb

Aaron doesn’t react and silence hangs for a beat
TUCKER (CONTD)

Hey let me ask you something is
Jeff really pissed

AARON

Are you drunk or stupid
TUCKER

What
AARON

How could you not realize he’s
pissed Have you even talked to him
since Saturday

TUCKER
I tried calling but he doesn’t
pick up What’s his problem

AARON
His problem Are you such a
narcissist that you don’t know why
he’s mad Do you have any concept
of friendship How have you made it
this far in life without
understanding this stuff

TUCKER
Fine I’1l check into the hotel in
Wilmington tomorrow and just go up
there and apologize to him and we
can be done with this bullshit

Aaron gets up and hastily pulls his things together
AARON
I guess God truly does protect
fools and children because you’re
both

Aaron turns and leaves Tucker at the table

EXT WEDDING HOTEL - ESTABLISHING

A large high-end hotel The kind that looks like it would be
a destination hotel for weddings and anniversaries

INT HOTEL BRIDAL SUITE - AFTERNOON - NEXT DAY 81
SUPERSCRIPT DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING
Kristy freshly showered is in a towel Bags and clothes are
everywhere Jeff is channel surfing There’s a knock at the
door Kristy looks through the peephole
KRISTY
It’s Tucker Do you want to talk to
him

Jeff shrugs with ambivalence She opens the door

TUCKER
Is Jeff here

He peers around Kristy and spots Jeff on the couch flipping
channels ignoring him

TUCKER (CONTD)
Can we talk

Jeff doesn’t respond Tucker looking a little lost for the
first time peeks expectantly at Kristy

TUCKER (CONTD)
(to Kristy)
Can I come in

Kristy opens the door wider and Tucker walks in

TUCKER (CONTD)
Dude Jeff sorry

Jeff searches Tucker’s face for an extended beat

JEFF
Sorry is just a word

Jeff turns the TV off kisses Kristy on the cheek and
retreats into the master bedroom without another word
closing the door quietly behind him

TUCKER
What should I do

KRISTY
Apologize sincerely

TUCKER
I just did

KRISTY
Tucker what fantasy world do you
live in One word and the Guy Head
Nod isn’t a sincere apology

TUCKER
What else am I supposed to say I’m
not a mind reader

KRISTY
Do you understand the magnitude of
this situation He lied to me for
you He landed in jail because you
failed as a friend in every way
possible

TUCKER
I didn’t make him lie to you

KRISTY
He lied because he was your friend
Tucker To protect you

TUCKER
That’s stupid Protect me from
what

KRISTY

From his future wife thinking his
best friend is a selfish lying son
of a bitch Except it’s worse than
that because I always knew you were
selfish Now I worry that you’re
this uncontrollable destructive
force that I can’t trust to have
the best interests of the man I
love at heart

Kristy’s exhortation freezes Tucker

KRISTY (CONTD)
That’s what you don’t seem to
understand Part of friendship is
supporting each other and knowing
each others boundaries Do you even
know where Jeff’s are

TUCKER
Yeah of course

KRISTY
So you just ignored them then
Pushed right past them He
sacrificed his line in the sand to
protect you and you couldn’t even
sacrifice a midget vagina for him
Is it any surprise you aren’t
welcome at our wedding

TUCKER
I’m not invited

KRISTY
No Tucker you aren’t

Tucker stands there stunned

TUCKER
No way What does Jeff say

KRISTY
You don’t get it I don’t care if
you’re at the wedding It’s Jeff
who doesn’t want you there

Kristy looks sadly and reluctantly into Tucker’s face as he
processes her words

INT HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Tucker emerges from the bridal suite He looks like he’s

mulling over his options He pulls out his phone and dials

INT HOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Candles lit There’s a fruit tray and champagne Aaron’s

AARON
No thanks We’re staying in

pussy doesn’t mean you should be a
pussy Let’s go out

AARON
Yes Tucker Insult us and
insistently reassert your initial
demand That’ll make the
difference

TUCKER
What are you talking about

AARON
You nearly submarined one of your
friend’s relationships already this
week I’d like a chance to see if
mine can float before you do your
best to torpedo it I’11 talk to
you later

Aaron hangs up and plugs in his special controller

84 INT HOTEL ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 84

TUCKER
Well fuck ‘em if they can’t take a
joke I’m all the party I need

85 INT RANDOM DURHAM BAR - A FEW HOURS LATER 85
Tucker is flirting with a pair of girls at the bar

TARGET GIRL
I have two cats A girl and a boy
Abigail Lulu Dibiase and Jersey
Lemon Dibiase

TUCKER
Why would you own cats Do you
enjoy having big boxes of shit in
your house

TARGET GIRL
I clean the litter boxes every day

TUCKER
Does it not bother you how haughty
they are They could give a fuck
about you

TARGET GIRL
Not my cats They aren’t like
regular cats they’re like dogs

TUCKER
Right on cue EVERY cat person says
that You know whats not like a
regular cat A fucking dog

No one but Tucker laughs He finishes his beer and leaves

TUCKER (CONT’D)
No need to thank me your silent
awed adoration is it’s own reward

He’s pleased with himself until he realizes he’s the only one
there alone He looks around for an escape from the
awkwardness and finds it in a girl with her face up to a tank
near the front of the bar filled with cute little turtles

TUCKER (CONTD)
What are you doing

TURTLE GIRL
Talking to the turtles

TUCKER
Did they tell you to kill hookers
Thats what they tell me to do

Turtle Girl shuffles away slightly embarrassed Two girls
seated nearby look on in disgust Of course the chubby one
chimes in

CHUBBY INTERLOPER
What kind of man says something
like that to a woman

TUCKER
Usually its my misanthropic friend
Aaron then I pick the girl up on
the rebound But hes not here

FRIEND OF CHUBBY
So you’re drinking alone That’s
one of the beginning stages of
alcoholism you know

TUCKER
Im way past the beginning stages
I already hide liquor around the
house and drink alone in the dark

CHUBBY INTERLOPER
Thats sad

TUCKER
No way Drinking is highly
underrated Think about it What
are the detriments to being drunk

FRIEND OF CHUBBY
I dont know

TUCKER
It hurts relationships with family
and friends I dont like my family
and my friends drink as much as me
It causes long term health
problems I drive way too fast to
worry about anything long term It
costs money Im going to spend it
recklessly anyway better on
alcohol than drugs or pornography
Causes rude and aberrant behavior
Im an asshole when Im sober
being drunk actually calms me down

The girls look at each other in disgust

TUCKER (CONT’D)

Now compare that to its benefits
Drinking makes me invulnerable to
criticism makes ugly people
attractive

(pointing to Friend of

Chubby )
makes boring people interesting

(pointing to Chubby

Interloper)
and makes hot girls like me For my
money the choice is obvious

Friend of Chubby looks hurt Chubby Interloper predictably
is fuming with disgust She is shooting death rays at Tucker

TUCKER (CONTD)
(gesticulating like
Hacksaw Jim Duggan)

Mongo angry Mongo smash

CHUBBY INTERLOPER
You just totally blew your chance
you know There you were standing
by yourself when these two hot
girls decided to talk to you--

FRIEND OF CHUBBY
What hot girls

CHUBBY INTERLOPER
Us

FRIEND OF CHUBBY
Ohyeah

Tucker bursts out laughing The girls get up to leave

TUCKER
That was going to be my question
too WHAT HOT GIRLS God bless
your overworked heart

CHUBBY INTERLOPER
Ooh another fat girl joke That
really cuts deep

TUCKER
The only way I could cut you deep
is with a battle axe and a running
start

Tucker is completely taken with his quick wit He turns to a
group of dudes behind him to share the joy

While he’s turned away from them Chubby Interloper quickly
plucks a bottle of Visine from her purse and dumps the
contents into his beer

CHUBBY INTERLOPER
(quietly to her friend)
Thirty minutes he’s gonna be in a
world of pain

Tucker composes himself turns back and takes a long
satisfied pull from his beer

TUCKER
(motioning to the girls)
This beer has been brought to you
by the number 10

Standing side by side he bursts into laughter again
CHUBBY INTERLOPER

At least I’m not out at a bar BY
MYSELF

Chubby Interloper and her friend look at each other with that
“ewwpathetic look It stops Tucker’s riotous laughter He

fumbles for something to say in response but can’t respond
to their truth

TUCKER
Fuck you Fatty

Tucker walks off in a huff taking another pull from his beer

GIRL
Crashed and burned Huh Mav

Tucker looks at her confused and then sticks his nose in her

crotch and sniffs

TUCKER
Slider you stink

ANGRY GUY
Hey man back off She’s with me

TUCKER
I don’t know what you’re worried
about This one should be in the
bag Only easy sluts make Top Gun
references in public

ANGRY GUY
You need to get out of my face

Tucker puts his beer down and addresses only the girl

TUCKER
This your boyfriend He looks like
the type of guy who eats with one
arm guarding his plate

He pushes Tucker to the ground and the bartenders separate
them Tucker grabs his beer and careens into the line for the
bathroom He finds himself behind CONNIE a fake-titted
blonde MILF with a ring on her finger

TUCKER (CONTD)
So are you actually married Or do
you just wear that to keep the
douchebags away

CONNIE
No Im actually married

TUCKER
How good is your marriage

CONNIE
Good enough to keep me in it

TUCKER
Then what are you doing here

CONNIE
Girls night out

TUCKER
C’mon isn’t that just code for
“Let’s Get Drunk And Suck Off Hot
Guys In the Bathroom”

CONNIE
Maybe for the girls you hang out
with
TUCKER
Are you calling my mom a slut
CONNIE
(laughing)

Does she know you talk like that

TUCKER
Does your husband know you flirt
with men you meet in bars

Connie playfully pulls the beer from Tucker and takes a good-
sized drink He grabs it back and pounds the rest The
bathroom door opens and Connie starts to go in
TUCKER (CONTD)
You’re not going to invite me in
CONNIE
There’s only one toilet
TUCKER
There’s a sink isn’t there
Connie pulls him in and shuts the door
INT BAR BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 86
Connie is in the near stall Tucker is pissing in the sink
CONNIE (0C)

CONNIE (0C)
You think Im hot

TUCKER
Baby youre so hot if I were
dating you Id never leave the
house Id never even leave your
vaginal area unless I was cumming

Tucker finishes and zips up as Connie emerges from the stall

CONNIE
You think I’m gonna have sex with
you

TUCKER

Please I am going to hit it so
hard whoever pulls me out of you
will become King of England

Tucker grabs her pulls her into him and swallows her face

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR ELEVATOR BANK - LATER 87

Elevator doors open Tucker and Connie are in the exact same
position as the bathroom eating each other’s faces They
stumbled out of the elevator and down the hall

TUCKER
Your tits are so hot

A loud gurgling sound emanates from Tucker’s abdomen and he
grimaces with discomfort

CONNIE
Stop talking you’re going to ruin
it
INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 88

The room is dark Tucker and Connie barge through the door
peeling clothes off and turn on the light A stronger wave
of abdominal discomfort overtakes Tucker as one hits Connie

TUCKER
Wait I have to shit

CONNIE
Let me go first I’1ll be quick

Connie slides into the bathroom Tucker pulls the bed covers
back kicks off his shoes and shimmies out of his pants
Unnatural sounds begin to emanate from the bathroom as his
discomfort continues to build

TUCKER
What are you doing in there

CONNIE (0S)
Nothing

Sounds of prodigious shitting fill the room only adding to
Tucker’s crescendoing pain

TUCKER
It doesn’t sound like nothing
Hurry up

CONNIE (0S)
I’1l be out in a second

TUCKER
Turn on the fan

Connie emerges from the bathroom and Tucker shoots up

CONNIE
(uneasy and hurried)
I don’t feel well I’m gonna go

TUCKER
What

Connie moves past Tucker to collect her stuff

CONNIE
(sheepishly)
There’s something wrong with the
bathroom

INT HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 89

The bathroom looks like the lower 9th Ward after Katrina
Brown shit water is spilling onto the bathroom floor and the
tank is gurgling demonically It’s a sensory assault

TUCKER
You clogged the toilet You clogged
a motherfucking hotel toilet What
kind of constipated meth-head bowel
movement does it take to clog a
HOTEL TOILET

ANGLE ON Connie shuffling past the bathroom

TUCKER (0S) (CONTD)
Those things are designed to suck
down third trimester shit babies
and you clogged it Is this what
married life does to people

-and out the door unnoticed He grips his abdomen and ass

TUCKER (CONTD)
Oh no Where’s another bathroom

Tucker dashes out

INT HOTEL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 90

Tucker bursts out of the elevator looks around frantically
and sprints to the empty front desk It’s 4 am He hits the
bell furiously for an obnoxiously long time until the
sleeping clerk comes out

TUCKER
Is there a bathroom down here

FRONT DESK CLERK
Back corner of the lobby

Tucker takes off turns the corner from the front desk and
immediately realizes his mistake The lobby is triangular

TUCKER
Which corner

He spots a white door at one end of the lobby quickly
waddles to it holding his butt cheeks together and bursts
through the door

JANITOR
AAAYYYY

It’s a janitor’s closet

TUCKER
Where is the bathroom

JANITOR
Que No no hablo ingles

TUCKER
WHAT UhuhDONDE ESTA EL

JANITOR
(pointing across the
Lobby )
Alla Alla

Sixty yards away a large RESTROOM sign hangs above a door

Tucker breaks into a dead sprint and his boxers start to sag
Thirty yards his ass crack and legs get noticeably wet
Forty yards his boxers have slid down to mid-thigh Ten
yards from the door he’s covered in brown viscous liquid
Little specks hit the back of his head and ears as he runs

INT HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 91
Tucker bursts in He’s completely shit himself He steps out

of his pink boxers shit puddle in the seat and flings them
blindly as he breaks into the first stall

INT BATHROOM STALL - CONTINUOUS 92

Tucker plops down on the seat and immediately slides off His
ass is covered in slimy runny feces still spouting black
viscous human waste He flushes it overflows and he fumbles
out of the stall sliding on his shit-covered socks

INT NEXT BATHROOM STALL - CONTINUOUS 93

Tucker collapses onto the seat until he finishes--exhausted
dehydrated and tearing up from the exertion Theres no
toilet paper Tucker takes off his shirt but discovers its
covered in little specks of shit

INT BATHROOM SINK AREA - CONTINUOUS 94

The large vanity mirror has a thick black streak from the
ceiling to the countertop where his boxers are crumpled in a
ball He peels off his shit-heavy socks and flings them in
the direction of the boxers One sticks to the mirror

INT HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 95

Naked and covered in speckles of his own poop Tucker slinks
out into the lobby

TUCKER
Who else on this earth could be
having a worse night than me

Laid out before him is a trail of his own feces It starts
wide at his feet and gets smaller until it apexes at the
clunky white shoes of the small Mexican janitor

TUCKER (CONTD)
Sorry I mean uh lo siento

Tucker walks defeated toward the elevators The Lady Janitor
is sobbing hysterically

INT HOTEL ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 96

Waiting for the elevator Tucker stares at himself in the
reflective doors looking into his own eyes and
facedisappointed He exhales deeply as the elevator
arrives with a ding and the doors open

Through the glass of the elevator as it ascends Tucker sees
why the janitor was crying hysterically

There’s shit everywhere on the couches the walls the
plants everywhere

TUCKER
God I hope they serve beer in
hell
EXTINT WEDDING CHAPEL - NEXT DAY 97

Jeff and Kristy have their backs to us The last groomsman is
not dressed the same as the rest because he took Tucker’s
place at the 11th hour They finish the ceremony and turn
down the aisle Jeffs black eyes and swollen brows are
smeared in DermaBlend Sweating from nerves Jeffs face
looks like someone pissed on a chalk painting

INT TUCKER’S HOTEL ROOM

Tucker looks a little bleary-eyed but he’s freshly showered
and hastily yanking on his tuxedo The room service menu is
open on the bed and he’s on the room phone

TUCKER
Yeah Yeah I know I don’t care
The biggest one you got ASAP Now

Tucker hangs up as he zips his fly done getting dressed

EXT RECEPTION HALL - LATER 98

The banquet hall is beautiful Large bay windows frame the
elegant wedding reception inside It’s an idyllic scene
broken only by workers setting things up on the lawn

INT RECEPTION HALL - LATER 99

The maid of honor is finishing her speech Tucker slides in
quietly and settles against the bar He whispers something to
the bartender who nods and sneaks him some money

MAID OF HONOR
And after that I knew she’d met a
keeper And I was right I love you
Kristy

Everyone toasts and politely claps The BEST MAN Jeffs
brother picks up the mic He is sweating and nervous

ANGLE ON Tucker at the bar He motions to the bartender for a
beer

WEDDING BARTENDER
Four bucks

TUCKER
What

BEST MAN (0S)
Hey I am Jeffs older brother

WEDDING BARTENDER
Cash bar

TUCKER
Who has a cash bar at a wedding

Tucker reluctantly pays as we ANGLE BACK on the best man

BEST MAN
I’ve known him his whole life and
boy are my arms tired

No response ANGLE ON Aaron sitting at a table with Lara

AARON
Bet that joke killed on his blog

ANGLE on Best Man

BEST MAN
Uh when Jeff told me he’d met the
girl he wanted to marry I couldn’t
believe it Only a few short years
ago he was throwing rocks at
girls and now he is putting one
onher finger

ANGLE on Tucker standing at the back of the room

BEST MAN (CONT’D)
I have known Kristy for a few years
now and I couldn’t have asked for
a better sister-in-law Here is to
my little bro and his bride

Everyone toasts Tucker walks to the front and takes the
microphone from Best Man

TUCKER
(to Jeffs brother)
Gimme that mic Sling Blade

TUCKER (CONTD)

(into the mic)
Some of you may not know me my
name is Tucker Max Jeff is my best
friend Or at least was until last
week when I took advantage of his
kindness and loyalty I forced him
into lying to Kristy dragged him
two hours away got him abusively
drunk and then ditched him to
sleep with a midget stripper I am
the reason that on the most
important day of his life Jeffs
face looks like a melted Barbie
dolls

Kristy’s mother is nearly apoplectic Jeff holding back his
building fury scoots his chair out to get up but Kristy
puts her hand on his leg to stop him and keep him seated

TUCKER (CONT’D)

The worst part is that I didnt
know I was doing anything wrong I
was just doing what I’ve always
done which is pretty much whatever
the hell I want And to be honest
its worked out pretty well for me
up to about 24 hours ago When my
selfishness finally caught up with
me and cost me Jeffs friendship
and my invitation to his wedding

Aaron and Lara look at each other

TUCKER (CONTD)

Still I shrugged it off and went
out anyway I wont bore you with
the particulars but the long and
short of it is I got drunk and
ended the night sprinting across
the hotel lobby uncontrollably
shitting my pants

Gasps across the audience

TUCKER (CONT’D)

No really I crapped all over the
lobby And following my selfish
pattern I left the mess and went
back to my room like nothing
happened

More gasps

TUCKER (CONTD)
The only thing that prevented me
from passing out in a pile of my
own puke was all the knocking at my
door

INT HOTEL ROOM - LAST NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Tucker opens his hotel room door to see the maid eyes still

red with tears

TUCKER (VO)
It was the hotel maid

A mop and bucket in her hands that she thrusts at Tucker

TUCKER (VO) (CONTD)
Staring into her angry overworked
face I had a moment of clarity
Someone else always cleans up my
mess and for the past few years
its been Jeff

INT WEDDING RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS

TUCKER
At three in the morning on my
knees literally cleaning up my
shit for the first time in my adult
life I finally understood what an
amazing person Jeff is and how
lucky I amwasto call him my
friend

Tucker turns to look at Jeff and Kristy with real sincerity

choking up a little

TUCKER (CONTD)
Jeff Kristy I hope you can accept
my sincere apology When I came to
your hotel room last night to say
sorry I honestly didnt understand
what I was apologizing for But
over the past 24 hours its hit me
like well like ten pounds of
slippery shit Ive been a horrible
friend And even though I probably
dont deserve to have either of you
in my life I had to come here to
tell you that and to ask you for
your forgiveness

ANGLE on Jeff and Kristy who look at each other

TUCKER (CONT’D)
I know this will probably scare the
crap out of most of you but I hope
to have kids someday I am sure I
will only have daughters and they
will all be vicious sluts who sleep
with assholes just like me and then
throw it in my face But such is
karma If one is a boy though I
will consider myself a huge success
as a father if he grows up to be
half the man that Jeff Smith is
right now

ANGLE ON the room Expressions have softened the room is
quiet some still unsure what to think ANGLE ON Aaron and
Lara

LARA

(crying)
That’s so sweet

Aaron rolls his eyes ANGLE ON Tucker who has turned to
address Jeff directly

TUCKER
Jeff I have never thanked you
never acknowledged you never
really even thought about it I
just took from you dude I’m
really sorry And for once I want
to give you something back

Tucker motions to the bartender who flips a set of switches
that pull back the drapes on the bay windows behind the head
table revealing a huge bouncy castle on the lawn

KRISTY’S MOTHER
Oh no

JEFF
OH YES AWESOME

The crowd erupts with laughter and applause The children run
outside to play in it Tucker sets the mike down and hugs
Jeff and Kristy and they toast to the bride and groom

INT WEDDING RECEPTION - MONTAGE 102

hilarious story as the center of attention Aaron refuses to
dance despite Lara’s seductive stripper moves

INT RECEPTION BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT 103

Jeff Kristy Aaron and Tucker are standing at the bar at
the end of the night ties undone just the four of them
They look content

KRISTY

idea what you were going to do But
that was a great speech

TUCKER

TUCKER

AARON

Did you really clean it up

TUCKER
Well the maid did show up at my
room with a mop and a bucket But

years What do you think Tucker
would do

INT HOTEL HALLWAY - LAST NIGHT - FLASHBACK 104

Tucker opens the door The maid eyes still red with tears
thrusts a mop at him He refuses it She thrusts it at him
again He pulls out a 20 bill She refuses He pulls out
another 20 She accepts them and Tucker closes the door

INT RECEPTION BAR - CONTINUOUS 105

AARON
I knew it You don’t even do your
own laundry

JEFF
You didnt clean it up You stand
up at my wedding pour your heart
out and its all bullshit

TUCKER
It’s not all bullshit I don’t need
to actually clean up the mess to
learn the lesson

AARON
I don’t even know why this shocks
me anymore

Jeff and Aaron look at Tucker with a mixture of bemusement
and amused disbelief Before anyone says another word a dog
comes into frame leading a CUTE GIRL toward the ballroom

doors It’s a seeing eye dog The cute girl is blind A beat

As recognition of the blind girl settles over the trio the
mischievous glimmer returns to Tucker’s eye and they see it

TUCKER
I’1l be right back

Tucker breaks for the cute blind girl as we

CUT TO BLACK
