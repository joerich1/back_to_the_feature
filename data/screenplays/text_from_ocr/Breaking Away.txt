FADE IN
EXT QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1

A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation
Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the
road The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it
through the foliage In the distance we see four guys
walking TOWARD the CAMERA There is a swagger to their
walk MIIizg is singing The others are humming along The
melody of the song of 0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie
but its a loose version

MIME
AND WHEN I DIEWONT YOU BURY ME
ON THEPARKING LOT OF THE A AND P
BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS
AND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS
I HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R
TO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P
I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR
TO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL
By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA Mike is
handsome and well built CYRIL is tall and skinny MOOCHER

is very short DAVE hanging back a little is carrying a
large trophy
DAVE
Bravo Mike Bravo Bellisimot

CYRIL
Did you really make all that up
They pass

ANOTHER ANGLE
The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now More
and more blocks of cut stone appear The guys are dwarfed
by them They have to climb over some

MIKE
I sent away for this stuff from
Wyoming Itll tell you everything
Since you dont believe me maybe
youll believe it when you see it

CYRIL
And wed work on the same ranch
and sleep in the bunkhouse
together eh
