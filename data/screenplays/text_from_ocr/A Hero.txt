Hello Bahram How are you You said youd be here at 5
Nothing serious hope would have preferred to see you to
sort this out after three years Hes put together part of his
debt Around 70000

Hossein puts the loudspeaker on for Rahim to hear

HAMID (offscreen)
Weve had many of these meetings Ive heard many of these
promises from this

Rahim is uncomfortable Hossein cuts the loudspeaker

HOSSEIN
For the 70000 Im promising His friends and family found it
for him

He puts the loudspeaker back on

HAMID (offscreen)

Well then let some of his friends and family come and write me
four or five post-dated checks to pay off all his debt and then
Ill withdraw the case

HOSSEIN
Listen if he gets out hell make sure he pays off the rest bit by
bit

HAMID (offscreen)
You are his relatives and you wouldnt write checks for a loser
like him Why do you expect me to trust him

HOSSEIN
can hardly pay my rent otherwise would never have let him
spend one night in prison

HAMID (offscreen)
Youre saying if he comes out hell pay it off bit by bit Give me
a bond check and hell pay you back later

HOSSEIN
Do him a favor and let him out

HAMID (offscreen)
He didnt even feel sorry for his own wife and child he doesn’t
deserve any favors

HOSSEIN
Dont worry about what he deserves Do you want your money
or dont you Half of your debt is ready cash

HAMID (offscreen)
You dont trust him enough to write a check for him This scum
ruined three years of my life and you want me

HOSSEIN
Its not about trust

HAMID (offscreen)

What is it about then dont trust him anymore If he says its
day Ill believe its night was fooled once by his hangdog
look but that wont happen again

Hossein is obliged to cut the loudspeaker again Rahim is very embarrassed by what
has been said and feels humiliated Nazanin looks at him in a reproachful way He
leaves the shop without a word Hossein doesnt know what to do He keeps
listening to the voice on the phone while watching sadly as Rahim goes

HOSSEIN
Thats right

RAHIM

Mr Taheri to be honest the 70000 It was when found the
bag thought could sell the gold to pay back some of my
debt But then my conscience didnt allow me to do it

BAHRAM
But your conscience doesn’t bother you with me

HOSSEIN

Maybe he did wrong in his situation to listen to his conscience
and give a poor woman her money back You wouldnt have
minded receiving someone elses money

BAHRAM
Mr Taheri can talk to you in private for a couple of minutes

TAHERI
Ill ask you to leave if you don’t mind

leave the office Taheri gets up from his desk and sits beside

BAHRAM
What proof do you have that this story about finding a bag isn’t
just made up

TAHERI
And what makes you think it is

BAHRAM
know him better than you His ex-wife is my wifes sister

TAHERI
That doesn’t prove anything Whatever you say he made a
very humane gesture

BAHRAM

How come he became so human overnight If he was so
human why would his wife leave him although they had a
child

TAHERI
Do you have any proof he has lied or anything

BAHRAM
do

TAHERI (surprised)
What proof

BAHRAM
know that hes been bullshitting people all his life

TAHERI
What bullshit

BAHRAM

He said on TV that he got a loan and wasnt able to pay for it
What bank would ever give a loan to a guy like him What
doesnt he say it was from a loan shark Why does he keep

ying

TAHERI
aybe he was embarrassed to confess it was from a loan shark
Thats no proof

BAHRAM
‘ll wait and see if he pays me But if he doesnt Ill denounce
him

TAHERI
Denounce what About the bag he found if the owner hadnt
called the prison nobody would have known anything

BAHRAM

f he didn’t want anybody to know why did he plaster the
prison number all over the place He could have just given his
cellphone number so the owner could contact him directly

TAHERI
There are no cellphones in prison

BAHRAM
So how could he text me from prison then

TAHERI
He sent you a text from the prison

BAHRAM

Do you want to know what his story is all about Ever since he
learned that his ex my sister-in-law is getting married again
he started to hassle me with his texts Full of bullshit and
promises to get my agreement and get out of jail And why all
that To stop her from getting married

TAHERI
All that’s his private life and none of my business

BAHRAM

You asked me how knew his story was fake Thats why I’m
telling you all this He feels humiliated by his wife’s remarrying
He invented this whole story to restore his reputation and
become respectable in the hope that his wife would change
her mind and go back to him Thats what its all about

TAHERI
No Youre wrong have information that proves what you say
isnt right

BAHRAM
Yes it is

TAHERI
He has a partner He plans to marry her when he gets out of
jail
Bahram is taken aback by this information
BAHRAM
Anyway don’t give a damn about knowing whether he really

found this bag or not All want is to get my money And not in
dribs and drabs dont want to get three cents a month

TAHERI
OK Give him a few days Ill talk to him and see how he can
pay you back

BAHRAM
And if he doesn’t

TAHERI

BAHRAM (furious)

RADMEHR
This man did a good deed You could make an effort

BAHRAM

What good deed madam Even if he found a bag and brought
it back to its owner he only did his duty Not bringing it back
would have been a problem

HOSSEIN
In his place would you have brought it back

BAHRAM
Of course Why not

MAZROOEI
Youre not in prison like him If you were in his situation

BAHRAM

Excuse me but many people are in far worse situations than
him They could steal and they dont will there be an evening
organized for them I’ve never dishonored anybody will they
give me a certificate for that Where in the world are people
celebrated for not doing wrong

RAHIM
Your problem is the certificate

BAHRAM
My problem is you being so ungrateful

RADMEHR
The certificate is the least we could do for someone whos had
such an exemplary attitude

BAHRAM

What exemplary attitude are you talking about My attitude
was exemplary when three years ago because considered
him a member of my family gave a bond check so that he
could get a loan start a business and help his family get
through I’m the one who did a good deed When he didnt
meet the payments had to sell my daughters dowry and my
wife’s jewelry to pay off all his debt plus the interest and
penalties to the loan shark And now he’s presented as a hero
and me who did so much for him I’m the bastard creditor

TAGHIAN
Not al all

BAHRAM
He was about to sell the coins for 70000 and give them to me
and refused Didnt

HOSSEIN
Yes you did

BAHRAM

What if Id accepted to take them He would have happily
come out of jail and wouldnt have said a word about the coins
he found Its because refused that he built up all this story

RAHIM
wont reply because Im too kind to disrespect you

BAHRAM
Please do reply

RAHIM
Youve been slandering me for three years

BAHRAM
Slandering Do you want me to call your wife on loudspeaker
so everybody hears what she says about you

RADMEHR
What has his wife got to do with all this

RAMEZANI

the news its been for a murder or some hanging offence For
once somebody restores our reputation please don’t sabotage
it

MAZROOEI
Now hes got a job and hell pay you with his salary Hell give
you guaranteed checks

BAHRAM
dont want a staggered payment Otherwise would have
accepted it three years ago and wouldnt have sent him to jail

HOSSEIN
But he doesnt have the money Look at his son This poor kid
has no-one to look after him thats not fair

Bahram looks at Siavash sitting sadly and silently in a corner

BAHRAM
Its for this kids sake that havent protested so far have
behaved as a father to him when he was in jail

TAHERI
Can you come here for a second

Taheri takes Bahrams arm and leads him to the side of the room to talk to him in
private The others are sitting around a table and carrying on their conversation
Siavash stares at Bahram

TAHERI

We have arranged for him to appear on a TV show on the holy
evening of Shaban will have him call you during the show and
you should say that you consent to have him released because
of the good deed he did You would teach a good lesson to
the audience and restore your image

BAHRAM
Restoring my image will give my daughter a dowry

TAHERI

Do you know that if he pays that amount to the court as a bail
and signs a staggered payment for the rest he will be released
the next day But if you take this money and let him out it has
much more impact

Bahram looks at Siavash who hasnt stopped staring at him

BAHRAM
If agree its only for this poor kid

TAHERI
Well done Thank you very much Lets go

Taheri goes back to the table looking satisfied Bahram is still sitting on the other

All the members of the board of the association are meeting obviously to take a
collective decision Ramezani opens the door and comes in along with Rahim
Siavash and Hossein The assembly greets Rahim coldly He sits down with Siavash
Ramezani stays standing

RADMEHR
Mr Soltani what possessed you to do that

RAHIM
What did do

RADMEHR
Show him

Taghian brings out his phone and opens a message He gives Rahim his phone so he

can see the video Rahim can’t believe his eyes Everybody watches him in silence
Hossein and Siavash look at the phone screen

Video of Bahram’s shop security camera

The images of the security camera in Bahram’s shop show the clash between him
and Rahim then their fight The video was recorded by a phone off a computer
screen Nazanin’s voice comments

NAZANIN’S VOICE

These images were filmed today in my fathers shop The man
we see attacking my father is the one whos been presenting
himself these past few days on TV as a model prisoner who
generously gave back a lady her bag with a lot of gold coins in
it

Other images follow of Farkhondeh storming in and shouting at Bahram who is
tidying up his shop Two people who came in to stop the fight are still there
Nazanin can also be seen

NAZANIN’S VOICE

The woman coming into the shop seems to be his girlfriend
and she defends him very aggressively because she thinks my
father denounced them for inventing this story of coins being
found My father explained to both the prison authorities and
the charity association who robbed poor people for this guy
that this whole story was made up don’t know whats behind
it but in any case they didn’t want to listen to him There we
see the woman threaten me and my father and leave the shop

Rahim is dumbfounded by the video Siavash looks at his father stunned Everybody
looks at him in silence

Rahim is ashamed

RAHIM
Has he shared that

TAGHIAN
His daughter sent it to Mrs Radmehr and says if her fathers not
paid in two days shell share it everywhere

RAHIM
He started insulting me

TAGHIAN
The video speaks for itself You attacked him all of a sudden

RADMEHR

Now that youre known as a role model that people follow
you you can’t do things like that I’m sorry but that’s
thug-like behavior

MAZROOEI

Do you know how many dowers we find each year for young
brides in need How many dialyses we finance for the sick
How many convicts sentenced to death we save from hanging
by paying the recompense Do you think people will still want
to give us money once this is shared

RAHIM
Whats that got to do with me

TAGHIAN
Whats that got to do with you

RAHIM (to Siavash)
Son did you give the lady the bag yes or no

SIAVASH (stuttering with difficulty)
Yes gave it to her Dad called from prison and said a lady
was coming to get it

RADMEHR
Was it the lady in the video

SIAVASH
No

RAHIM (furious)
Why are you making him say things

HOSSEIN
Shh Rahim

RADMEHR

Your creditors daughter also sent this video to the local
council They called me and said that the lady in the film who is
apparently related to you went there today and claimed your
family gave her back the bag Is that right

RAHIM (ashamed)
had to do this because it’s impossible to find the real owner

TAGHIAN
Does someone who lies so easily deserve us collecting money
to get him out of prison

ANOTHER MAN

Your lying is your problem but if this video gets out do you
think peoples trust in us will ever be restored Who would
want to help our association You have harmed all the other
poor people we could help

RAHIM (hopeless)
The truth is these coins were found by a lady

They are all stunned

HOSSEIN
What lady

RAHIM
The one in the video

RADMEHR
So why did you say you found them

RAHIM
told the prison authorities it was a lady who found them they
said it didn’t matter could say it was me

MAZROOEI
So you didn’t find them Yet another lie

KIANI
Why did they tell you to say it was you

RAHIM
dont know

RADMEHR

You played with the reputation of our association Weve been
struggling for twenty-five years to try and help people and you
ruined it overnight

RAHIM
Let me explain can even call this lady and have her come
and explain everything now

MAZROOEI
What lady

RAHIM
The one who found the coins and gave them to me

TAGHIAN
don’t understand a word of his story

Rahim takes out his phone and goes out while calling a number Hossein goes with
him under the disapproving looks of the whole assembly

78 — INT AFTERNOON -CHARITY ASSOCIATIONCORRIDOR

Rahim and Hossein talk standing in the corridor of the association A young woman
and her little daughter sitting on chairs look at them

HOSSEIN

them to you to pay your debt

RAHIM

HOSSEIN
How come don’t

RAHIM
Shes the lady Im supposed to marry soon Maliheh saw her

HOSSEIN
You said everywhere you found them you made it all up

What is it all about Tell me the truth at least

RAHIM
Its the truth

HOSSEIN
Instead of all this you should call your creditor and apologize
so he doesn’t share the video

Rahim can’t decide Hossein takes out his phone to call a number Ramezani comes
out of the office and approaches them

RAMEZANI
Come back in everybody is waiting for you They want to go
home

79 — INT AFTERNOON -— CHARITY ASSOCIATIONOFFICE

The board members are still engrossed in lively discussion Siavash listens affected

MAZROOEI
If the video gets shared and creates a scandal well have
trouble explaining ourselves and apologizing itll be hellish

Siavash listens to these conversations without anybody noticing that he’s there
Ramezani opens the door and comes in

RAMEZANI
Hes trying to convince his creditor not to share the video

RADMEHR

Even if the video isn’t shown we still have to make a
statement People trusted us with their money We have to
make a statement this evening

KIANI
Saying what

RADMEHR

That we checked afterwards and realized the story wasn’t
crystal-clear and as a consequence the money collected will
stay in the associations funds

MAZROOEI
We could say well use it for the recompense of this poor guy

TAGHIAN
Yes agree

Siavash stuttering worse than ever tries to speak with difficulty

SIAVASH
Excuse me My father didn’t lie

The whole assembly is touched

RADMEHR
Son were not saying he lied The problem is we dont
understand what he says

Rahim opens the door and comes in with Hossein

RAMEZANI
Well

HOSSEIN

Please transfer the money to the creditors account tonight
Tomorrow Rahim will give him the checks for the rest and hell
agree not to share the video

RADMEHR
We cant give him the money with all this

RAHIM
Why not

RADMEHR

Morally we have to contact every donor and let them decide if
they want their money back or if they accept to give it to
another needy person

RAHIM
But the money was collected for him

MAZROOEI
No it wasnt It was thanks to our dependable reputation

RADMEHR

Would it be fair to give the money of these poor people of
these prisoners to this man who is now confessing that the
coins were found by someone else

RAHIM
Will you let me explain madam

RADMEHR

Explain what You took that lady to the council saying you
gave her the bag and now we find out shes your friend
Whats left to explain

HOSSEIN
If he shares the video the associations reputation will be
ruined

RADMEHR
Mr Taghian call him again and request him not to share the
video until we find a solution

TAGHIAN
Hes more accommodating but his daughter wont let it go

RADMERR (to Rahim)
You paid us back very badly

Radmehr leaves upset Rahim is confused Radmehr bumps into the young woman
in the corridor who gets up and talks to her Siavash looks at Rahim

TAHERI

RAHIM
No in fact you told me it wasn’t worth bothering saying all
that

TAHERI (annoyed)
Youre lying to my face

RAHIM
You told me that in the other room Mrs Marvasti was there
can call her if you want

Rahim goes towards the door to ask Mrs Marvasti to come in as a witness

TAHERI

Come here told you to go and give the same story You told
me you couldnt name the lady because nobody knew you
were together

RAHIM
Yes but

TAHERI
Was it also me who told you to go in front of the camera on the
sidewalk and say that was exactly where you found it

RAHIM
You told the papers and TV to come and interview me It never
even crossed my mind that this story would be made public

SALEHPOUR

If you didnt want anybody to know you would have given your
sisters number When she called the prison of course we
would find out

RAHIM
swear on my only childs life that never calculated all that

TAHERI
What do you expect from us now

RAHIM
Mr Taheri has to come and tell the association that I’d already
said somebody else found the bag

TAHERI
Why not tell them yourself

RAHIM
did but they dont believe me

TAHERI

There is already this rumor that the prison authorities invented
this story All we’d need is for me to go to the association and
everywhere else and say that we knew from the start that this
man didn’t find the bag and somebody else gave it to him

SALEHPOUR
How many days leave have you got left

RAHIM
Its my last day

SALEHPOUR

Go today and give the checks to your creditor and ask him to
forgive you on your knees if you have to You have to convince
him not to share the video Wait until he deletes it in front of
you And tomorrow come back to prison and don’t breathe a
word about this affair until it’s gradually forgotten

RAHIM (shocked)
What do you mean forgotten gave the coins back

TAHERI
You just said you didnt think about anyone else finding out So
now just imagine you did the deed without anyone knowing
about it

RAHIM
That would have been different Now theyre saying Ive lied
didnt lie

SALEHPOUR
But you didnt tell the truth

TAHERI
Youre either very smart or very naive

RAHIM
If was smart why would be in prison

SALEHPOUR
For now go and dont do anything

RAHIM

Ill go to my creditor and convince him not to share the video
but on the condition that first you go to the association and the
council and tell them told you it wasn’t me who found the
bag

TAHERI (angry)
Youre imposing conditions on us

RAHIM
If he shares the video youll be in trouble too

SALEHPOUR (to Taheri)

Call the newspaper and deny everything right away Tell them
we were tricked by this individual too

This remark enrages Rahim He leaves slamming the door

SALEHPOUR
Call him back

Taheri goes to the door and opens it

TAHERI (to Rahim)
Come here
