DAVID KARMANI late 20s dressed in RN scrubs attends to
a patient sitting in the solarium

His face -- thin dark beautiful could be Italian
Spanish Black -- an indistinguishable mix he is like
the future and the past all rolled up in one A small
CROSS old silver sits on a chain around his neck --
not as a fashion statement or a fuck you but a simple
personal intimate expression of faith

A DOCTOR a woman all business comes behind him

DOCTOR
(irritated)
Could you go to room 512 the
patient thinks his blood pressure
is dropping Goddamn TV shows

He looks her in the eye without attitude but also
without any sense that she is better than him or anyone

It stops her -- for just a moment

EXT WEST 103RD STREET - DAY 36
Its the same street she walked at the beginning before

the attack a street shes walked a thousand times
before

Hands in the pockets of her jacket Erica heads down the
familiar quiet three-block stretch

ERICAS POV

She MOVES FORWARD DOWN the sun-lit street familiar with
its corners its rhythms its shadows --

But the sunlight only increases her unease Every shadow
holds a terror for her

A youth sitting in the shadows on the stoop talking
into his cell phone

A car up ahead a lone man sitting in it again on the
shadowed side

She speeds up to pass the car but the CAMERA SLOWS ON
his face the windscreen cut in half by the shadow his
face against the shadowed seat
He seems to be glaring at her

Ericas eyes start scanning the street as she walks past
the MAN in the car

The CAMERA SLOWS even more -- the few feet of shadowed
pavement seem to take forever to cover

She makes it past then the car door opens behind her
The loud sound of a DOOR SLAMMING Then FOOTSTEPS
following

She tries to calm herself but her battered body will not
listen -- her CHEST starts pounding she wipes her sweaty
hands on her coat -- the sound of his FOOTSTEPS GROW
LOUDER she cant bring herself to look around

he YANKS herself back even as she picks up her pace --
he SOUND of her QUICKENING FOOTSTEPS his FOOTSTEPS
quickening too her breathing her racing pulse blend
together until the SOUND DROPS OUT -- and Ericas
BREATHING becomes the unsettling soundtrack to her panic

tn

The man is alongside her now on the street side

FUCK She stops dead And the GUY totally unaware
of her walks on to the newspaper stand buys his paper
a pack of gum

INT POLICE STATIONMAIN AREA - DAY (PREVIOUSLY SC 33) B37

Erica enters through the main doors Holds onto the door
handle

She looks at the lobby area of the police station -- cops
moving back and forwards with guns in holsters people
milling around sunlight streaming through the huge
windows

It seems all she can to enter this public space But she
does Walks forward to the desk

COP

COP (OS)

ERICAS POV

Maybe its the isolation in their faces the unbearable
knowledge that what happened to them will never matter to

anyone as much as it does to them -- but all of a sudden
Erica gets as we do what they have in common -- theyre
victims -- and she is one of them

After a beat she gets up and leaves

as she FIRES TWICE more blindly BOTTLES SHATTERING

She listens to the silence then Peers round the shelf
that divided them Sees a spray of blood hitting a
tomato can Below it the gunman dying blood spouting
from a single shot to his jugular vein

And then in an act more significant than she knows she
pulls it together She lowers the cocked hammer on her
semi-automatic and puts it back in her pocket

She surveys the STORE -- sees the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
pointed down at her

She looks at the womans dead body behind the counter and

The gathering crowd local TV trucks arriving Yellow
tape around the subway entrance Police keeping the

Everything about her is different -- her walk the hunch
of her shoulders shes thin pale -- both exposed and

protected damaged and tough a ghost and a new being all
wrapped up in one

a CROWD and some media A couple of REPORTERS try to

ask him questions he waves them off

As he turns away he sees a FACE he thinks he recognizes

They catch eyes for just a moment -- but its enough to
make Erica turn walk away

MERCER (0OS)
Hey Hang on

She stops Panicked suddenly Tries to quell it her
face turned away from him She finally succeeds and
turns to face him

MERCER

screen TV is on in the BG with the SOUND OFF

Mercer and Erica sit at a table across from each other

ERICA
Have you ever done an interview
before

MERCER

Not on this side of the table

MERCER
Evidence

She smiles He is beyond laconic

ERICA
Such as --

MERCER
Murder weapon entry wound
prints carbon fragments DNA
samples position of the corpse
Its amazing what a dead body can
tell you

ERICA
So the dead do talk

She hides her emotion But he notices

MERCER

Everybody talks And almost
everybody lies But a dead body
cant

(pause)
But then the lies can tell you
things as well People tell them
for a reason

ERICA

So those bodies last night

What are they telling you
MERCER

You read the paper

BEAT

ERICA

Should I believe what I read

there
But Mercers attention is drawn to the TV
ON TV Murrow the MAN from the hospital is getting out
of a car his arm around his frightened stepdaughter He
tightens his hold on the girl as they head past a crowd
of reporters and into an APARTMENT building
Erica watches Mercer he shakes his head disgusted

MERCER
Ever read about him

He has said too much
over the microphone

She rolls back the tape

ERICA

(off TV)

Why do I know him

MERCER
He owns the parking out on

Roosevelt Island

ERICA

benefit --
(off the TV)
-- that that asshole and the
subway shooter dont have

ERICA
(pause)
Do you really think theyre the
same
MERCER
They both walked away from murder

Let me ask you a question -- how

do you put it back together after
what happened to you

ERICA
You dont put it together 94
MERCER
Im sorry That came out wrong
ERICA
No Its a question I suppose
you become someone else
MERCER
Who do you become
ERICA
A stranger
He can read her emotion
MERCER
You must have loved him very much
ERICA
Yes
MERCER

And that makes it harder
Sometimes you wish you didnt

He is talking about himself He reaches for his absent
ring She notices that

ERICA
Youre not married

MERCER
My ex-wifes having a baby with
another man So Id pretty much
say yes Im not married

They have both revealed a bit too much

disappointed He gestures for the check She stops his
hand
