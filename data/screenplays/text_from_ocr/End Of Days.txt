and it is written that when God made Man in
his image he asked the angels to bow down
before his greatest creation One amongst
them refused and for that sin Lucifer the
Angel of Light was cast from God’s grace
and imprisoned in the darkness of Hell

But once every thousand years when the
etars are right Lucifer ig freed from his
prison seeking vengeance against Man If he
can cross the threshold of Hell with his
chosen mortal bride he shail be given
reign over earthly souls and all mankind
will be damned”

EXT VATICAN CITY - NIGHT

The majestic towers of the Vatican rise high into the night
their shadowy faces lit from the glow of street lamps below
The moon not yet full hangs low in the sky But somethings
different Above the moon is a FAINT ARC of some kind

In the window of one of the tower rooms candle light a
flickers and a shadow moves across the pane of glass

Monastically spare - a wooden chair table and bed Open on
the table is an ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT Beautiful lettering
adorns its worn parchment pages and a rich illustration
leaps off the opposing page The shadow moves across the
page A Monk takes his seat at the table

MONK
All my life have I watched the skies
waiting for the sign

The monk points to the illustration in the manuscript The
full moon hangs low in the sky Across the top of the moon is
a comet its tail sweeping in an arc cover the glowing orb
The effect is that of a giant eye Beneath it a child lies
inside a Pentagran

MONK (contd)
(reading)
Under the eye of God the child is
bern She shall be marked by darkness
Another SHADOW moves in the candle lit room His vestments
rustle as he moves to the window balcony stepping out inte
the night air Above him in the sky THE VERY SAME SIGN A
comet arcing over the moon

MONK (contd)
Your Holiness there can be no doubt
It has begun

The shadow figure steps into the light We see by his
vestments that he is indeed THE FOPE

POPE
Send emissaries out to all the cities
of the world She must be found

In the shadows we see other religious leaders of all faithes
They murmur amongst themselves One among them a CARDINAL
steps forward
CARDINAL
She must be destroyed Let me convene
the knights
POPE
tf we sacrifice the innecent we do
not deserve to be redeemed
The Monk turns the page of the manuscript In the next
illumination the Knight on the cliff is now surrounded by
fire A Young Girl in rags is curled around his feet The
knights SWORDTIP points at THE DEVIL

EXT NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

Dark THUNDERHEADS roll over the towering skyscrapers Angry
billows spitting down shafts of LIGHTNING
Deep echoes of rumbling thunder roll up and down the avenues

ExT CITY - NIGHT

A quiet block of brownstones darkly silent on this night
with the exception of far away flashes and distant rumblings
The blacktop on the street SHAKES starts to CRACK

A terrifying rumble as the earth tears open

A WALL OF FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE CRACK The entire block is
swallowed by flame Windows blow out A GIANT TONGUE OF FIRE
reaches high up to heaven as if hell itself had erupted

The wall of flames swirl down the streets and in the flames
we see A SHAPE perhaps a monstrous Wing perhaps a giant
taion stepping forward all covered by a shroud of fire The
shape pushes further and further out until the fire parts and
out of the fireball steps

A MAN

Handsome elegant aged yet ageless there is something
about him that is immediately frightening

He looks around as if seeing the world for the very first
time He takes a deep breath of air removes a silver case
from his jacket pulls out a cigarette He takes a drag and
the cigarette IGNITES into a flame ON ITS OWN The whole
block is in flames behind him casting his long dark shadow
down the street

From a dark alley we see a homeless man an ALBINO peering
out the terrifying scene He turns and runs —

InT JERICHOS BEDROON - NIGHT

As THUNDER CRACKS rattling windows Jericho bolts straight
up in bed breathing hard

ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING and the first thing we notice is
the glass Great wide windows Great wide sky-lights looking
wp to the heavens The city stretches around us for 360
degrees A flash of lightning illuminates the room and we
see that the apartment is very spare No art minimal
furniture

Jericho clicks the light on We can see large welts stretch
across his chest where the bullets hit He checks the bruises
and when he touches one he winces

He rises and crosses to the window On the night table isa “™
single picture in a frame of Jericho much younger a woman
and young boy

The storm ocutside intensifies and suddenly THE LIGHTS GO OUT
DARKNESS

A match is struck Jericho brings the flame to light a
candle But the candles blown out He lights it again Again
it dies He tries again holding the match on the flame

CRASH Glass shatters A rush of wind The candle and match
blow out

In flashes of lightning we see that the driving winds have
blown one of his windows open The wind billows into his room

Another flash of lightning and he sess a WOMAN (not the one

in the picture) standing near him ARMS OUTSTRECHED

PLEADING

Darkness again

Jericho crosses to the window and pushes it shut

He hears SIRENS outside He crosses to the window and

peering out he sees FLAMES lick the sky a half-mile away and )
hears the wailings of police and fire trucks

FATEER MURPHY
On Judgement Day the righteous are
gaved They ascend to heaven But at
the End of Days there is no
salvation only a new hell brought to
Earth by the Devil himself

FATHER MURPHY
fhe church isnt anxious for people

the righteous can be damned

A couple of red-eyed FRAT BOYS sidle up to either side of
him The Propbet backs away The Frat Boys pounce and begin
beating on the Prophet A few pedestrians try to break up the

millennium through the alignment of
Heaven and Harth he is freed from
his prison

JERICHO
Listen Ive seen things I cant
explain But Satan No

They look

PATHER MURPHY
The devils greatest trick was to
convince the world he didnt exist
The modern age has all but killed
hin But Nullus diablus aullus
redemptor

CHRISTINE
What does that mean

FATHER MURPHY
IZ you have no devil then there is
no reedemer If you deny the Devil
you deny God

CHRISTINE
Father what does he want

FATHER MURPHEY
In the three days before the New
Year if the Dark Angel can carry his
chosen mortal bride back across
Hells threshold the wall between
hell and earth will fall

JERICHO
Why three days

FATHER MURPHY
For the holy trinity

CHRISTINE
The woman how is she chosen

PATHER MURPHY
By his legions of followers The
signs indicate she was born June 6th

at Christine She quietly takes a seat and nods

FATHER MURPHY (contd)
According to the Prophecy he will
join with her and their half-mortal
gon will reign over a new kingdom
here on earth All souls even the
sighteous will be dammed —

CHRISTINE
Heli on Earth

ourselves

battle It’s ours

JERICHO
Weve been around for thousands of
years Weve yet to see Hell on Earth

always come forth a righteous
warrior to keep the girl from harm

Jericho looks at the illustrations in the book

And how do they defeat the Devil
with a sword

PATHER FETERS
tte is not just a sword its a
metaphor for faith

CHRISTINE
And who is the protector

YATHER MURPHY
God only knows

CHRISTINE
(to Jericho)
Maybe its you

Father Peters shakes his head

YATHER PETERS
The Protector is a man of great faith
and virtue No offense but I dont
think hes a candidate

JERICHO
This is a fairy tale Christina
Somethings going on but the Devil
isnt walking the earth

CHRISTINE
‘X felt him Jericho I felt hin

“yy

SERICHO
I know you believe But it isn’t
real Theres some other explanation

PATHER PETERS
Jericho as sure as God is in heaven
the Devil is real And if Thomas
found this woman she might very well
be the one hes coming for

JERICHO
He had pictures of me too

YATHER MORPHY

The Vatican sent Thomas because he
was sensitive to certain spiritual
matters He could see things others
couldnt I dont know what role you
play if any but my guess is -
youve already played it by bringing
her here Well protect her now

JERICHO
Do you have weapons

FATHER MURPHY
Of course not This is a church

Jericho looks at Christine

JERICHO
Wait here for me

He heads out the door

Jericho claws his way back up to the video screens Searching
them And then one by one each of the twenty video screens
goes black They hear scratching and clawing at the metal
Footsteps walking above them and then walking below then

They follow the invisible creature with their eyes and ears
as the sounds scamper around the outside of the roon
Christine steps behind Jericho standing close to him
Jericho pulis out his gun

JERICHO
Were surrounded by bedrock Nothing

The vault rocks back and forth violently Theyre thrown
against the floor Metal twists and buckles

The lights go out Eerie Red Emergency lighting comes on
They wait holding their breath

ONE SIDE OF THE VAULT abruptly JERKS UPWARD followed by the
other side

Its as if

JERICHO (contd)
Hes pulling us to the surface

The vault leaps and shakes We can hear earth and stone and
metal twist and grind through the steel walls As the floor
pulls up from under them they slide down to what was the
side wall Tables and chairs and video equipment tumble down
on top of them Jericho covers Christine with his body and
takes the brunt of a heavy wooden desk and several computers

The Vault jerks upward again and again accelerating in pace

JERICHO (contd)
Grab hold

Like the express elevator from hell the earth spits up the
vault Lights flicker furniture tumbles equipment shatters

Then suddenly all is quiet

A couple of the emergency lights are still lit Dark and
gloomy though as if in seme crypt Jericho has his body
wrapped around Christine

on his forshead She touches it lightly Theres something
erotic about her touch Jericho pulls away

The wall before them begins to glow a dull red at first and
then a bright orange

Jericho climbs over debris to the weapons locker now face
down on the ground He pulls it open Inside are weapons
Jericho pulla out a pump-action rifle and loads it

CHRISTINE
What are you doing

JERICHO
He was beaten before by other men
Men with nothing better than a sword
A hole appears in the steel as the liquid metal drips away

CERISTINE
Hes coming through

Jericho grabs and MP-5 FULL AUTO and slings it on

JERICHO
Get behind me

The lava hole in the metal grows Beyond it is a dark
silhouette his hands pressed against the metal

CHRISTINE
Whatever happens thanks for trying

with a flash the molten metal peels back revealing the Man
Jericho fingers the trigger on the shot gun

A quiet moment as the two men regard each other The Man
steps forward and

Jericho fires

but not down

BAM BAM BAM Jericho drives the Man back out the melted
opening and into

The housesized vault rests beside a huge pit in the roadway

by the Hunter Security Building Crashed cars are scattered
about the intersection

Hundreds of his followers crowd the streets like an Army of —m
the Damned

The Man lies on the street fallen

The crowds look down at the fallen Man and then at Jericho
They cower away as Jericho swings the MP-5 around at the
crowd

But from the corner of his eyes he sees the Msn rise

Jericho turns and opens fire with the MP-5 The rounds drive
into the Man but still he stalks toward Jericho Jericho
backs away keeping up the barrage of bullets until he and
Christine are pressed with their backs against the wall

MAN
Dont you understand Its futile

The Man reaches out and takes the gun from Jericho He grips
it tight and the gunmetal melts in his hand

Jericho throws a punch at the Man landing firmly on his
chin The Man glares at Jericho insulted by the blow

The Man grabs Jerichos fist and drivas it back slamming hin
against the wall He smashes Jericho with his forearm

Jericho falls to his knees The Man looks to Christine ™

Jericho tries to break away He tries to run But they swing
at him they pelt him He covers his head and pushes through

They hound him like a pack of dogs and slowly they bring him
down beating him senseless

Pinally JERICHO COLLAPSES

crowd The Mans followers line up behind him in a
processional following hin

away in the crowd

Jericho pushes his way through the stream of humanity until
he breaks out and edges into a dark alley

And now we can see a structure starting to form

A MIGHTY TEMPLE

EXT NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT
Deserted

Alone Jericho staggers through the devastation left in the
wake of evil

Buildings are on fire

The streets run red with blood

Jericho sees a fallen gargoyle lying on the ground He lifts
the heavy carved stone and carries it up the steps of a
mighty building

Jericho stumbles and falls before its heavy doors

It is THE ARMORY

Jericho pulls himself up takes the gargoyle and smashes it
against the door The wood splinters

EXT TIMES SQUARE - NIGET

The ground ceases its rumbling as the temple has formed

A TEN STORY PENTAGRAM stands behind an ALTAR atop a pyramid
Steps appear on the angle of the pyramid seemingly formed
from the faces of tormented souls

Jericho siides back into the HUMVEE and peels out

EXT NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Jericho steers the Humvee through the obstacle course of post
-zviot debris In the distance he sees the glowing fiery light
of Times Square but just up ahead is an archway
fy

(

You could say it was soaring and majestic if it werent for
the twisted wrecked frames of men piled atop each other like
some freakish car accident

Jericho slows the Humvee and looks on at this horror The
writhing corpses moan out to him in unison

VOICES
Go back Go back

Jericho drives the Humvee through the arches
Inside

Jericho sees the mass of humanity huddled before the Temple
He floors it

The Followers scatter as the Humvee plows them aside
At the foot of the temple -

THE MAN TAKES CHRISTINE by the hand and leads her up the
steps But

Jericho skids the Humvee to a halt by the Temples base

Followers rush the Humvee but when Jericho opens fire with
an M-16 they cower away

The square falls silent as Jericho exits the Humvee
clutching the Grenade Launcher

Jericho looks around at the lost souls at the temple of evil

The Man walks toward Jericho

had a deal

I lied

Jericho fires two more grenades at the Man as he struggles to

The Man tumbles down the roadway like he was hit by a train
and collapses in a pile of broken flesh

Jericho crosses to him and leoks down at what used to be the
Mans face But now its all sinews and singed skin

MAN
(seething whisper)
You think youve won

This is but flesh
And then THE GROUND BEGINS TO TREMBLE
Jericho loses his balance and falls to the ground
The Mans legs rip open and MIGHTY TALONS extend from a

Jericho scrambles to his feet and retreats to the Humvee

SATAN

You dare defy me Jericho I shall

Jericho whips out the Stinger missile and levels it He

“pivots back to face the Demon The Demon sees the missile

pointed straight at hin

Times change Welcome to the twenty
first century “-

Jericho launches the Stinger It impacts in Satans belly and
explodes The flesh and scales blow back revealing

A THOUSAND TORMENTED SOULS inside the belly of the beast
Satan reels back Screaming in pain

A handful of followers charge at Jericho but he opens fire
with the M-16s blowing them back

SATAN pulla back his arm and a swirling ball of fire rises in
it He launches it at Jericho

Jericho divas out of the way The fireball sails over
Jerichos head slamming into the side of a building

Jericho mounts another Stinger and FIRES

The missile flies But the Dark Angel dodges and the Stinger
impacts against a billboard of a broadway play

CATS - NOW AND FOREVER topples crushing several hundred of
the followers

More followers attack but Jericho lets leose a barrage of
bullets from both sub-machine guns

Satan draws another ball of fire from the air and huris it

Jericho grabs for his weapons and rolls for cover just as a
fire ball hits the Humvee BLOWING it to kingdom came

Jericho slams another Stinger into the launcher He takes
some time to aim

Satan flaps his leathery wings and lift into the air like
some ancient dragon

Jericho firez WHHHOOOOOSH This time the Missile slams into
Satans head BOOM Lucifers head explodes raining fire
down from the sky

The crowd of followers scatter to avoid the hellish shrapnel
as the Dark Angel plummets to the ground

Jericho slides his last Stinger into the launch tube

The HEADLESS BODY rises from the pavement swaying back and
forth hands grasping at the air

JERICHO (contd)
Youre going down

Jericho unleashes his last Stinger WHOOOOSH BAM It slams
into the Dark Angels belly among the writhing masses

BOOM It explodes in a massive fireball of flesh and fire

When the smoke clears Satan is gone

Jericho eyes the lingering smoke and fire He hears a massive
groan coming from the heart of the city

A thick fiery smoke hangs in the air and then slowly twists
back into form and substance Smoke trails snake out
wrapping themselves like a tentacle around Jericho The
tentacle grows until it is a BONY HAND

SATAN (V0)
You think your armaments can defeat
the immortals Who do you think
taught mankind to build weapons

Jericho is enveloped now He yells fighting to break free
He rises in the air twisting and turning until hes face-to-
face with THE BEAST

He opens fire with the M-16 But the bullets wounds are
barely pinpricks on Satans horrific scaly body

SATAN
Por thirty thousand years Ive walked
through the hearts and minds of men
and your downfall is my glory
I have built the gas ovens of
‘Auschwitz I have haunted the killing

Christians to rape and loot in the

Satan tosses Jericho away

Jericho sails through the air arms flailing and SMASHES

from the wound and rains down exploding like grenades as it
hits the earth

Jericho runs for cover

mighty sword striking through the vipers nest and severing
the heads of the snakes The snake heads continue to snap as
they roll inte balls of fire on the ground

Jericho dives over the flailing tail and raises the sword
just is time to deflect a blow from Satan wounding him again

And then the BATTLE IS JOINED
Weve never seen anything like it

Jericho is possessed of faith and powers beyond our

COMMENTS

Marlowe has created an imaginative exciting and very dynamic
supernatural thriller While it contains some of the predictable
beats of a doomsday tale with a fairly static Satan figure
threatening to destroy the world the battles that erupt between
the heroic security officer and the demonic forces are nicely
conceived and full of resourceful and inventive special effects
The piece is after all special effects driven with NYC taking
the brunt of all the destruction and mayhem Not only is there
chaos in the streets of the city as Satan and his minions try to
establish a foothold but buildings collapse others are pulled
from the underground and fire and brimstonei makes its presence
known---on a very large scale The heart and soul so to speak
of the drama lies in the characters of the heroic security officer
who becomes the iProtectori of the woman chosen by Satan to be his
wife This character goes up against some of the most incredible
obstacles imaginable---demons burning buildings zombies quakes

etc---and still manages to stand on his two feet Touchingly he

seems to succumb to the power of Satan and momentarily become one
of his minions but this turns out to be only a trick to get
closer to the devil and destroy him---which he does in blazing
glory And speaking of glory---the material also is not afraid to
bring up questions of faith and virtue the heroic security
officer is not afraid to finally ask for help from God and it is
in these final moments when he accepts God and renounces Satan
that the script has its most powerful emotional impact The script
winds up succeeding on a couple of levels---the truly physical
action driven one and the more sensitive holy one The script
isnit entirely perfect though We wonder why the heroic officer
Jericho was targeted for destruction from the beginning----before
he even meets Satanis intended wife and if this is the case we
wonder why Satan canit simply remove Jericho as an obstacle As a
result of many similar questions the script seems from time to
time to be overly manipulated and contrived But the action
sequences seem to distract us from this and the energy never
subsides We also wonder why Satan canit just pick any woman he
wants as a wife not necessarily one who had to be ébaptized in
bloodi 25 years earlier Be that as it may the script is dynamic
and offers both action and food for religious thought
