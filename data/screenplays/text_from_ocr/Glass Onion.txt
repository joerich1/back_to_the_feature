a DIZZYING array of INTERESTING PEOPLE - models musicians
authors designers circus performers all reclining on
couches or grouped on the floor smoking and doing drum
circles and partying like it isnt 2pm on a weekday during a
pandemic

moment always paying attention to her and she looks both
fabulous and sick of life

9 INT THREE CAR GARAGE - DAY

A gorgeous MUSTANG parked in the background sleek weight
lifting equipment expensive gadgets DUKE CODY (40s very
fit) sits in the foreground speaking directly into the
camera We slowly widen to reveal the frame of a YOUTUBE
video around him - were watching him live broadcasting

DUKE
This has gotten some attention
obviously so I want to speak to
this - no Jimmy Kimmel I do not
hate boobs Boobs - breasts - give
us many useful things Milk Cheese
Breasts nourish our young until the
age where we can hunt for them And
lets be honest breasts are fun
Nothing wrong with that Am I right
babe

A 22 year old girl named Whiskey steps into frame dressed
in a sporty provocative way involving camouflage

WHISKEY
I love my boobs theyre super fun
Oops Sorry feminists

She struts off screen as Duke continues

DUKE
When we refer to the
breastification of America what we
mean is a breakdown of the natural
order evolutionary truths that go
back billions of years

A womans voice shouts from three rooms away

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Dukey

DUKE
If youre a young man in America
youre being asked to slow down so
women can catch up For centuries in
the western workplace has been
dominated by men because thats what
nature made us to do

We pull back from a computer monitor at which point we
REVEAL that he was in front of a greenscreen with a photo
background and is actually broadcasting from a slightly
shittier 3 car garage with none of the polish or decor
with a slightly shittier version of the sports car piles
merch with Lion logos and APEXOSITY slogans everywhere

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Dukey

of

DUKE
but you can have the next best thing
with our Apex Supplements Whiskeys
gonna break it down for you

Duke weaves out of the garage and into the hallway of a
mcmansion lots of cheap marble and clutter shutting the
door behind him His MOM walks through with a basket of
laundry speaks with a jersey accent

Whiskey takes over and starts pitching the supplements as
Duke walks out of frame

MA
Dukey I been calling you you gotta
answer me when I call

DUKE
Ma Will you shut it Im live weve
gone over this Whiskey and me when
were live -

Ma SLAPS him hard enough to rattle his teeth

MA
You tell your mother to shut up

DUKE
Im sorry its just were live
MA

Stares him down His eyes on the floor

DUKE
Nothing jeez mom Im sorry

She nods cooly and walks off
MA

LIONEL
Maybe its sensitive to heat

BIRDIE
Wait heres Duke hold on - Duke

Now include in the split-screening

INT DUKES KITCHEN - DAY 11

Dukes box is on the mcmansion kitchen table but his is
different - the wood top is not smooth and featureless but
COVERED IN complex puzzles He talks on speakerphone

DUKE
What is this thing My mom already
broke it

His moms voice from the hall

MA (OS)
Its a stereogram

DUKE MA (OS)
She did something to it and
it opened up I dunno she
broke it - Ma Its a stereogram I told

Lionels eyes widen as he runs his hands over the patterned
wood grain surface

LIONEL
A stereogram
CLAIRE DEVON
A what-o-gram Wait a
stereogram were those those The magic eye things I
things - could never do those
DUKE
Ma Whatd I tell you about touching
my stuff

11

Lionel brings his fingers close to his eyes so they cross

then moves it away - the pattern on the wood grain doubles

and blurs then focuses and comes together like a Magic Eye
painting forming a large 3D ARROW SHAPE He presses his

finger just under the tip of the arrow

A hidden button in the wood depresses with a CLICK and the
top of the box slides open with magical fluidity revealing
four quadrants with intricate puzzles three covered with
fine gold mesh

Lionels eyes gleam with childlike wonder

LIONEL
Oh wow

CUT TO the gang works together solving the puzzles one by
one The first is a checkered board with three colored
marbles arranged on it

PEG LIONEL
Do you group them by color
maybe - Or size Weight should I
weigh them

CLAIRE
Eight by eight - its a chess board
This is a chess endgame its - So
its set up for mate in one should
I -

LIONEL
Do it Kasparov

She slides one of the marbles to checkmate With the same
graceful fluidity one of the gold mesh coverings slips
away revealing the next puzzle

BEGIN A BRIEF SOLVING MONTAGE

A completed tic-tac-toe grid with an F to the left of it
and a small telegraph key (tapping device)

BIRDIE
Thats tic-tac-toe I know this
CLAIRE BIRDIE
But its solved already so
it cant be - thank you Its tic-tac-toe
Birdie for contributing

PEG LIONEL

Wait - the tapper thing

xs and os are dots and Dits and dahs Thats an O -
dashes and U - R FOUR which is
here -
BIRDIE

Its tic-tac-toe

He taps four dots and a dash and the next screen opens - a
sliding tile puzzle They all dive in slowly revealing a
large capital N

BIRDIE CLAIRE
Is something supposed to N maybe stands for
happen something maybe in one of

the other puzzles
Without turning from the sink Dukes mom

MA DUKE
Its a compass Ma

LIONEL
North The whole things a compass
turn it - whats true north where
are we - this way -

Spinning the box so it faces north jangling it a bit and
THE FINAL mesh SLIDES OPEN revealing the workings of a
MUSIC BOX In addition four little BARS pop up on the four
top edges of the box
The music box starts to play a classical tune

CLAIRE LIONEL
Its music Guys Its Shhhh
music Its music

BIRDIE
Are you mocking me

CLAIRE
Yes

BIRDIE
Alright ha ha Im gonna shazam it

Birdie loudly talks into a large white cube on the table

BIRDIE (contd)

Yo-Yo Ma eating a slice of pizza leans over to Peg

YO-YO MA
A fugue is a beautiful musical puzzle

Birdie realizes

BIRDIE

CLAIRE
I love you Birdie

BIRDIE

LIONEL
Wait Layered back over itself Hold

up

The entire top layer pops up like an album off a turntable
on a center spoke

It starts SPINNING then settles revealing FOUR NEW
PUZZLES

A whole new tune

the excitement mounts Finally

LIONEL
Forty seven for sure

DUKE
(looking at his phone)
Thats the atomic number of silver -
thats definitely silver

BIRDIE
Thats silver So this is it

They all set number tumblers (beneath a mounted chunk of
silver) to 47 A simple switch below the tumblers

LIONEL
Ok One Two Three

They all flip the final switch

The top of the box SPLITS down the middle and parts
revealing a CENTRAL CHAMBER covered with a wooden DOME

his DOME then opens like a flower in time lapse
eautifully revealing a recess with a blue index card sized
OTE inside

Zow

With hushed awe Claire Lionel Duke and Birdie all take
their notes and read

CLAIRE

HARD CUT TO

INT GARAGE 15

A darkened garage with moving boxes half packed A card
table has the familiar box on it still smooth and solid and
unsolved The LOVE MILES card next to it

Sitting behind the table staring blankly at the box is a
WOMAN in her 30s we have not met yet Her expression is
unreadable She stares at the box for a long while

Then she gets up and walks out of frame We stay with the
box Sounds of clattering Then a few moments later she
comes back

With a hammer

Without hesitation she SMASHES the box It splinters apart -
all the intricate puzzles shattering springs and latches
and pieces flying everywhere She smashes it until it breaks
open entirely revealing the invitation inside

She drops the hammer Takes the invite Sits Reads it

Something boiling behind her face Eyes brimming Maybe
rage Maybe sadness Whatever it is it stays behind her
eyes and she finishes reading and stares through the
invitation for a long long while

On the screen Blancs robot spins out into space resulting
in a VICTORY for the team

Hills dotted with rustic homes a charming HOTEL on the

At the end of this jetty sitting with his luggage Benoit
Blanc checks his watch He wears a dapper face mask

Blanc is alone Until an N-95 masked Lionel walks up with
his roller bag Stops about 20 feet from Blanc Gives hima
polite nod but doesnt engage checks his phone

Blanc waits a moment not sure if he should say something
Finally he decides this is silly and starts to say
something when -

18

BEEP BEEP

A cab pulls up and deposits a masked Claire and her
luggage Lionel greets her warmly Blanc stands but they
both ignore him and eventually he sits again awkwardly

LIONEL
Governor

CLAIRE
Hey genius

Birdie and Peg come down the jetty in a golf cart driven by
a masked BELLHOP from the little hotel Louis Vuitton bags

stacked in back She wears a fashionable but totally useless
lace mask

BIRDIE
Hellooooooo

Claire grins tightly leaning into Lionel

CLAIRE LIONEL
We need to talk I know

silks and a huge hat

BIRDIE
Oh my god We cant hug right Can

A sleek two level boat glides up to the jetty but Lionel
squints looking at Blanc for the first time

LIONEL

of - oh whatshername that ballet
dancer thing thats you

Before anyone can answer a deep guttural BOOM like a gunshot
draws their attention towards the town

19 EXT GRECIAN PORT TOWN STREETS - DAY 19
A helmet-less mask-less Duke roars through the narrow
coastal streets on a barking motorcycle Whiskey on back
She fires a ridiculous pearl handled gun into the air

gun which he holsters Grabs his rucksack

BLANC

MAN in sportswear hops out speaks efficiently 20

EFFICIENT MAN
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to
Greece That fine craft will take you
to Mr Brons island a two hour
journey Your captain Mr Andino will
assist with your luggage

The burly captain Mr ANDINO lumbers down the gangplank and
starts lugging the bags on board with a grunt The efficient
man wields a strange looking gun-shaped device

EFFICIENT MAN (contd)
But first would you each lower your
masks and extend your tongues this
will be momentarily uncomfortable

He starts with Birdie aims the guns nozzle into her throat
and shoots a burst of compressed mist with a sharp PSSST
She gags He gives her a white rubber wrist band

BIRDIE
Whew what uh -

EFFICIENT MAN

Blanc unbelieving nudges Claire Massages his throat

Theyre all filing up the gangplank when a tooting horn gets
their attention

A Greek TAXI pulls up and the woman who smashed the box
gets out with a small suitcase Looks up at them all

Blanc watches the gang whose jaws collectively drop Every
single one of them looks like theyve just seen a ghost
Birdie waves and smiles hollowly at the woman

BIRDIE
Andi Hiiiiii
(not much quieter)
Holy Shit 20

The efficient man greets the woman that Birdie called ANDI
and gives her her spray Blanc takes this all in

INT BOAT - AT SEA - DAY 21

as a statement of fact

ANDI

Blancs relief is palpable

BLANC

the dog in my life but this is
stretching my stride-taking
abilities

ANDI
Youre doing great Im Andi

BLANC
Very genial of you Benoit

ANDI
Youve got a flat tire there

His shoelace He stops to tie it

EXT VILLA - COMPOUND 26

Meanwhile up ahead the gang walks up a gentle tiered series
of landings climbing into the compound a mixture of
(excuse me) Bond villain lair and Mediterranean villa

Theyve just turned a corner into a broad open courtyard
and had their first real view of the places defining
feature - perched at the top of a grand gently sloped
staircase the main building is a massive orb of glass It
sits like a crown atop the entire complex

26

BIRDIE

Wow Its like an actual huge glass

onion
CLAIRE

(uh huh)

Yup

MILES

Yup its past present future What
came before me what I am what I
leave to the world

Derol walking by in the background

DEROL
Ignore me

MILES
This is the full reclamation of
everything Ive ever accomplished up
until now

Blanc and Andi join them exchange a look at Miless
oration

LIONEL
How big a staff does it take to run
this place

MILES
This weekend its just us Sent them
all home This is a normal weekend
with old friends

In the background Boston Dynamics ROBOT DOGS waddle by with
everyones LUGGAGE on their backs

MILES (contd)
I dont want this to be some rich
assholes house its not evena
house its a commune for creativity

Andi stifles a grin A low DONG sounds over the complex

LIONEL
What was that

MILES
An hourly chime I had Phil Glass
compose it to keep me centered in
time Speaking of lets start
experiencing this place together
(MORE) 26
MILES (contd)
The rooms are named after chakras
your biorhythm is your key get
changed settle and lets have an
afternoon by the pool before the real
party begins

All their white wrist bands start glowing a different color
and chakra name for instance Birdies says sacral The
various VILLAS around the complex emit a soft color-coded
glow into the air above them

BIRDIE
Sacral - you know me Miles

Everyone takes it in stride and parts with kind words for
their rooms

MILES
Andi I really am glad you are here

She gives him an unreadable look and walks off Then

BLANC
Wow Im sorry that is crazy

MILES
Mr Blanc Could I have a word

INT THE GLASS ONION - DAY 27

Miles leads Blanc into his office in the huge dome of the
glass onion

BLANC
Amazing just amazing all of this
Im so happy to be included and if
theres some role youd like me to
play in this murder mystery game as
the detective Im happy to oblige
Just Very happy To be included
And meet you Is that a motor car

Through the back of the onion perched on a platform high on
the roof of an adjoining building is a gorgeous light blue
Porsche

MILES
My baby blue Goes anywhere I go all
around the world

BLANC
Why is it on the roof

Blanc

MILES
(obviously)
Theres nowhere to drive it on the
island
BLANC

Ah of course

MILES
Mr Blanc I wanted to ask What are
you doing here

BLANC
Im sorry
MILES
What are you doing here
BLANC
You invited me
MILES
No I didnt
BLANC

You You sent me a box

MILES
You received a box

BLANC

Yes a wooden box was delivered to my

home with some simple childrens

puzzles
(Miles flinches)

and when I completed them there was

an invitation inside

MILES
Do you have that invitation

shaken digs in his pocket and produces a familiar
blue card hands it over

BLANC
I do - I thought maybe we had to show
it or I didnt know sorry Im
very confused is this part of the
game or

MILES
This is just like the others but I

didnt send you this

Blanc has switched to another gear

Miles squints then claps

Miles stands

His eyes grow distant

BLANC
How many of these boxes did you
create

MILES
Five One for each of my guests

BLANC
No test boxes or prototypes or -

MILES

No My puzzle guy barely got the five
done in time and he apprenticed with
Ricky Jay

BLANC
And once these boxes are open and the
puzzles complete is there a way to
close them again To reset them

his hands

MILES
Someone reset the box and sent it to
you as a gag

BLANC
Im mortified

MILES
Why Ive got the worlds predefinite
detective at my murder mystery party
that is so legit

BLANC

Mr Bron Ive learned through bitter
experience that an anonymous
invitation is not to be trifled with

MILES

Ha Cmon

and makes a grand sweeping gesture
MILES (contd)

I invite you to my home there done

youre invited Relax Enjoy the

weekend hell try to solve the murder

mystery If you can I dont wanna

toot my own horn but its pretty

next level See you by the pool 27

And Miles is gone leaving Blanc with a deep look of
concentration on his face

EXT POOL - DAY 28

Perched high on the property a long infinity pool meets the
sky seamlessly

Birdie makes her entrance in a fabulous swimsuit streaming
a silk robe behind her She sits by Lionel and Claire who
sports an aggressively plain beige one-piece

BIRDIE
Guys Lionel you are too hot to be a
scientist and Claire you look so
cute

Claire flips her off

CLAIRE
Aw thanks Bird

BIRDIE
You really try thats what I like
You make an effort

CLAIRE
Well I figured Greece

Their banter has an underlying affection to it

BIRDIE
God and no masks I can breathe again
look at this pool maybe Ill go for
a swim

At that moment Whiskey breaks the surface of the glittering
water in all her young instagram model splendor

BIRDIE (contd)
maybe Ill lay out for a bit

Blanc enters the pool area in long shorts and a short
sleeve button up shirt He joins Miles Birdie and Peg ina
lounge area where Miles holds court sipping a beer and
strumming his guitar

MILES
Blanc Have a dip Grab one of these
Jared Leto sent ‘em over Hard
kombucha Pretty good

28

BLANC
Well I am on vacation

DUKE
(from the pool)
Hey booch me

Miles tosses him one Above the bar cart a flashy painting
of the BLUE PORSCHE

BLANC
Baby blue

DUKE MILES
Iconic Remember you almost
pancaked me with it on the

road that night at Anderson Coopers birthday
Coops parties are
memorable

IN THE POOL - Lionel and Claire wade out into the deep end

Duke pulls himself out of the pool and does some stretches
He wears a speedo his gun belt and pistol dripping wet

LIONEL
Really Duke

Duke defiant draws and FIRES his gun into the air

Everyone jumps annoyed

DUKE
Really
LIONEL
Asshole
MILES

NOW its a party

Blanc wades into the pool with a beer still with his shirt
on Duke sits on the pool edge leans back in the sun

BLANC
That is quite a piece

DUKE
Never without it

BLANC
So I see 28

DUKE
You never know when shits going to
go down

Blanc eyes Lionel and Claire talking animatedly in the deep
end of the pool but cant make out their conversation

LATER - Birdie digs sunglasses out of her bag and lays out
in the sun keeping an eye on Miles who plays guitar for
Whiskey Peg plops down next to Birdie and low with fervent
urgency

PEG BIRDIE
Birdie You need to talk to I will
him Before dinner You need I will
to You need to beg him Oh god
PEG

When he goes to his room just follow
him and do it Ok

BIRDIE
Ill take care of him Dont worry

Birdie stares across the pool at Miles flirting with
Whiskey sad rage in her eyes

BIRDIE (contd)
There was a time you know back when
I was the one whod been on
magazines he was nobody he couldnt
believe he was talking to me He said
that Youre Birdie Jay from
billboards I cant believe Im
talking to you He was this little
thing in my hand

(beat)

I preferred that

Birdie lies back and notices Andi lying in the chair next
to her

BIRDIE (contd)
Andi Hi Wow Wow how long as it
been

ANDI
Since the trial so a few months 28

BIRDIE
The trial right yeesh that was not
fun for any of us but for all of
us Peg right Im uncomfortable Im
going to swim

She unceremoniously leaves Andi and Peg smile tightly at
each other

LATER - Blanc strolls out from the bathroom holding a
magazine He hears a clank and clatter - on a nearby table
a FAX MACHINE spits a sheet into a large bucket Miles
retrieves it and reads it

BLANC
I can handle the Matisse in the
bathroom but is that a FAX
machine

BIRDIE

(can you believe)
Miles doesnt have a phone

MILES
Its really convenient I have one
number goes to all my fax machines
anywhere in the world There is
something about analog -

The magazine Blanc holds is a vintage late 90s copy of
British fashion mag THE FACE A teenage Birdie is on the
cover with a large diamond set on her forehead

BIRDIE
Oh blast from my past look
everybody Miles you are so funny
keeping this around

He closes the magazine and sets it aside as Birdie joins the
small group of Blanc Miles and Whiskey in the shade

BLANC
Can I ask what first drew you all
together Such an eclectic bunch

MILES
I think disruptors recognize each
other

BIRDIE
Yes 28

BLANC
Youve used that word before what
does that mean

MILES
Well
(motions to Birdie)
Some people think Birdie is
disruptive every time she opens her
mouth just because she is saying
what everyone is thinking but no one
has the nerve to say

BIRDIE
I say it like I see it Its true

MILES
Seriously you know about Sweetie
Pants right

BLANC
Im going to embarrass myself - I
adore Sweetie Pants I live in mine

MILES

You are sitting next to Birdie Jay
she was a fashion magnet And

then the youngest editor of She-She
magazine right establishment BS on
top of the world But then -

BIRDIE
Well then there was the whole thing
with the Halloween costume it was a
tribute to Beyonce but people did
not take it that way Anyway I hada
lot of time at home I just spent all
my time in

BLANC
Sweat pants

MILES
She comes out with designer sweat
pants High quality fashionable
sweat pants hitting the market just
as the pandemic hit She disrupted
her own disruption She made a
killing

Duke comes in toweling himself off Miless hand which was
resting on Whiskeys knee subtly withdraws

MILES (contd)
Or Duke look at Duke do you think
people looked at him and saw anything
other than the beef you think they
saw the first gamer with a million
followers on Twitch Invented the
word “influencer

Claire and Lionel have joined the group

Andi appears

MILES (contd)
Or Claire blowing up conventional
politics or Lionel pushing science
past its comfort point its what I
did with Alpha its disruption
Thats what I did with Al
standing behind them Miles changes tact
MILES (contd)
Thats what we did with Alpha
Tell you a little secret Your world
is about to change Once you hear it
you cant unhear it Is your phone
turned off

BLANC

in my room

fe)

h I left it

MILES

kay If you wanna shake things up
tart by breaking something small
orm an idea a convention some
ittle business model You go with
hings that people are kind of tired
f anyway Everybody gets excited
ecause you are busting things up

hat everyone wanted broken anyway
nd thats this is the infraction
oint Because this is where you have
o find it in yourself to keep going
ill you break more things and bigger
hings and break the thing that
nobody wants you to break At that
point people will stop being on your
side There going to say you are
crazy they will say you are a bully
theyll tell you to stop even your
partner will say that you need to
stop Because nobody wants you to
break the system itself But that is
true disruption That is what unites
this group

a

ted 0PrPpdoodtrsnNO

(MORE)

MILES (contd)
Every single one of us has hit that
point and proved that theyre
willing to cross it Disruptors All
of us

A single pair of hands clap from outside the circle Andi

wry smile on her face

ANDI
Bravo That was - wow Real red pill
stuff Miles

Miles seems genuinely hurt

MILES
The Andi I built Alpha with she
believed it

ANDI
Oh I believe it Mr Blanc youre a
detective can you spot the other
thing the real thing that this group
has in common

LIONEL
Andi cmon -

But Andi continues with an almost unhinged intensity

ANDI
Oh Lionel Everybody knows who Lionel
works for thats no secret and we
know who bankrolled Claires
campaign But when nobody would touch
Birdie with a ten foot pole because
she went on Oprah and compared
herself to Harriet Tubman -

BIRDIE
In SPIRIT not - oh god

ANDI
- can you guess who stepped up as an
angel investor in Sweetie Pants Or
when Duke got banned from Twitch for
hawking rhino horn boner pills to
teenage boys

DUKE
There was ZERO rhino in those pills

a

28 28

ANDI
Who do you think set him up on
YouTube and used his media empire to
promote his stream Thats the real
common thread here Every single one
of you is holding on for dear life to
Miles Brons golden titties And
every one of you will stab a friend
in the back to hold on That is what
I believe

She storms off Claire goes after her

CLAIRE
Hey Andi - wait -

After theyre gone a moment of tense silence Miles leans
back as if hes just watched a great fireworks display

MILES
Wow That was real Anyway dinner at
eight see yall there

Miles ambles off

Duke storms off followed by Whiskey Lionel looks deeply
troubled A beat Then

BIRDIE
Like Miles said Im a truth teller
some people cant handle it

BLANC
(like honey)
Its a dangerous thing isnt it to
mistake speaking without thought for
speaking the truth

She grins flirtatiously at him

BIRDIE
Are you calling me dangerous

BLANC
Well well see If youll excuse me

With a charming grin he steps away She watches him go with
a wicked grin which then dissolves away to something else

29 EXT GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS 29

Lionel trots into a garden where he finds Claire Shes
watching Andi far off now vanishes into the greenery

CLAIRE
Somethings off I dont like this

LIONEL
What do you mean

CLAIRE
Shes changed

Claire seems afraid
CLAIRE (contd)
Whats she playing at
30 EXT ZEN GARDEN - DAY 30

Miles ambles towards his villa Peg runs up and stops him

PEG
Mr Bron

MILES
Hello

PEG

Dont do this Please Bird showed me
the statement you want her to make
to the press about Bangladesh And
if you make her go through with it
her name is destroyed But you see my
resume is just Birdie Jay Birdie
Jay a short stint in retail and then
Birdie Jay So you see if her name is
destroyed then my name is

MILES
Im sorry

PEG
»Peg

MILES

Im begging you - you gotta make her
make the statement Its her only way
out

30

He smiles reassuringly and walks off leaving Peg smoldering
with anger

REVEAL Blanc lingering behind a statue eavesdropping
Peg narrows her eyes then walks off

We stick with Blanc who also processes all this He walks
the strange beautiful grounds past gardens and art
installations deep in thought As beautiful as it all is a
sense of foreboding hangs in the gloaming

On the crest of a hill he catches a glimpse of Duke jogging

Blanc removes a slender cigar from his shirt pocket and
lights it No sooner has he exhaled one puff when LIGHTS
start blinking in the trees around him and a sharp ALARM
sounds

SOOTHING ROBOT VOICE
This is a smokeless garden This is a
smokeless garden This

Blanc tries to waft the smoke away but it all continues He
panics and tosses the cigar in a nearby pond

The POND then LIGHTS UP RED and another ALARM sounds
2ND SOOTHING ROBOT VOICE
Please keep our water clean Please
keep our water clean Please

Blanc assesses the situation and FLEES

EXT GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS 31
Duke runs then spots something slows stops Hunches and
creeps without making a noise He slips behind bushes close

to a picture window into a villa bedroom with half drawn
blinds Two people are kissing and talking on a bed

Miles and Whiskey

A twig SNAPS behind Duke He looks back - nothing there
Turns back to the window

About 20 yards behind him hidden as well Blancs head
rises up

He wrinkles his nose at the spectacle Then looks at Duke
Watching the pair who still kiss and speak

31

Rage on his face Twisting branches in his clenched fist
Next to his holstered gun

Not liking this at all Blanc silently withdraws

EXT THE GLASS ONION - EVENING 32

The central glass structure looms soft white bathing the
grounds in a welcoming aura as the sunsets final glow
dissipates The hourly chime DONGS

INT ATRIUM - EVENING 33

The main floor of the glass onion structure a wide open
space with a central entryway a very 70s feeling lounge
area with inset couches and a dining table witha
spectacular view

The guests filter in and Miles greets them drink in hand
and unlit pipe in his mouth

MILES
Welcome gang Some pre-murder drinks
Ive mixed everyones favorites And
weve got tamales

A stacked bar cart with fixed drinks on top each glass has
the guests name elaborately etched on it Lionel takes his
wryly and sips

MILES (contd)
My chemist

LIONEL
Lagavulin Sixteen

MILES
He likes it heavy on the fever

LIONEL
Serve it up neat

Blanc goes for the snack tray with mini tamales and hot
sauce loading one up

Birdie takes her tall yellow fruity drink

BIRDIE
Is this my Cuban Breeze

44

MILES

Its the drink that got us on the no-
fly list at St Barts What else

WW

RDIE
Hashtag worth it

MILES
Claire Bear - room temp white

BLANC
(the hot sauce)
Halle Berry - that has a kick

MILES

Jeremy Renners small batch hot
sauce I let him invest he sends me
like a pallet every year

Miles tosses Blanc a few bottles of the hot sauce which
Blanc awkwardly holds for awhile then not knowing what to

do with them

puts them in his jacket pocket

MILES (contd)
And I apologize I dont know your
drink but I have everything here
pick your poison

(then)
Hey Andi I am hoping its still
Whiskey soda

Andis slipped in a chill goes through the room and Lionel
and Claire turn their attention anywhere else they can

Front and center in the main entryway is a small framed and
very familiar painting behind glass

CLAIRE
Ok I know your whole thing with it
but but this place is like the
Tate Modern why would you hang a
framed print of the Mona Lisa front
and center Its like a Che poster in
a dorm room

Miles grins in silence for a long beat

MILES
Or

Lionel laughs 33

LIONEL
Cmon

Miles just keeps grinning

Lionel Blanc Peg Claire and even Andis jaws drop and
they step towards the painting in a trance

LIONEL (contd)
Thats impossible Miles -

Miles hits a red BUTTON on a pedestal and with a distinct
SHHHTINK the glass case slides away leaving the Mona Lisa
open and exposed in all her glory

Everyone is awestruck

BLANC
Forgive my incredulity but its
property of the state theres no way
they would -

MILES
Blame it on the pando Blanc Louvre
is closed France needs money and so
bought myself a little short term
loan You know it turns out the
security and transport cost more than
anything Check this out

He takes a silver lighter from his pocket and clicks it - an
eight inch long blue flame spears out above his pipe

And though hes a good distance back the protective glass
INTANTLY SHHHTINKs back into place Miles laughs With his
flame still lit he hits the red button and the glass re-
opens

MILES (contd)
Dont tell the insurance guys but I
had an over-ride button put in Where
do you think it is

Miles pushes down on a figurine of a little jester boy

Its so freakin sensitive a phone
dings and it closes up But I had to
be able to look in her eyes nothing
between us My mom took me to Paris
when I was six years old When I
looked in this ladys eyes it
changed my life

(MORE) 33
MILES (contd)

You know Da Vinci invented a
technique for brushstrokes that
leaves no lines Thats how her
expression changes when you look
straight at her try it Her smile
disappears Is she happy Sad
Something else This simple thing you
thought you were looking at takes on
layers and depth so complex they give
you vertigo

Andi stares deeply into her eyes Caught up in spite of
herself

ANDI
It really is something

In the background Derol walks by in a bathrobe eating
cereal Nods to the painting

DEROL
Classic Hey Im not here

Claire has realized something

CLAIRE
You know every time weve gotten to
the point I am going to strangle you
you pull something like this and its
magic Thank you

MILES
Look it all started with her Whatd
I say to you guys that first night
we all hung out at the Glass Onion
What did I say I want to be
responsible for something that gets
mentioned in the same breath as the
Mona Lisa forever

BLANC
And what does that mean

BIRDIE
It means immortality he wants to
create something that will -

CLAIRE
Wait a minute Miles Why do you have
the Mona Lisa in your living room

Then raises a closed fist and looks at Andi

MILES
In one week I have invited a dozen
world leaders and members of the
press to this island And right here
I will unveil the future

Miles opens his fist In his palm a milk white crystal

about the size of a quarter

MILES (contd)
Do you know what this is

LIONEL
You know damn well we do Whats
going on

BLANC
I dont

Miles tosses the crystal to Blanc

MILES

hats a new solid hydrofuel
adically efficient zero carbon
missions derived from abundant sea
ater I call it KLEAR with a K
nd at this event we will announce
LEAR America our affordable home
ower solution KLEAR is going to be
owering peoples dreams all over

his country by the end of this year

OBA

tUON DPE

Lionel sets his drink down sharply At its CLACK
SHHHHTICKs down in front of the Mona Lisa

LIONEL
No No Because I was clear with you
I told you I need two years minimum
to test the stuff and even see if
this stuff is safe or even viable
Claire and I are NOT going to be
responsible for putting something out
in the world before it is testedoh
no

the glass

Lionel has clocked Miless steady grin Miles gestures

grandly all around him

MILES
Oh yeah

LIONEL
No 33
BLANC
Youre running this entire place off
this
MILES

All of it all this awesome lighting
the heating and the cooling right
down to my fax machine the whole
glass onion its all powered by
Klear

Lionel and Claire suddenly look like theyre standing on
very thin ice

CLAIRE
Oh my god Miles

MILES
Guys we did it

LIONEL
Im out Done This is reckless and
you are going to get somebody killed

MILES
Youre not getting out its already
happening Love you Lets eat

He ambles off towards the dining room area Duke enters with
Whiskey trailing behind him Aggressive energy looks
ruefully at Miles walking off

INT DINING AREA - MINUTES LATER 34

Our gang seated at their plates which are elaborately
embossed with their names Claire and Lionel look sick
Birdie and Peg look sullen Duke looks furious especially
because the place settings have Whiskey seated next to
Miles

Blanc and Andi have been added in at the end next to each
other

MILES
Okay gang Its been a memorable
weekend already And now the real
fun starts Weve got three days we
will be basking in the sun the pool
swim in the Ionian Sea great food
and wine and each others company

(MORE)

49

MILES (contd)
But alongside and underneath the
party youve been charged with a
serious task Because tonight in
this very room a murder will be
committed My murder You will have
to observe the crime carefully use
your knowledge of each other and
keep your eyes sharp - Ive planted
clues throughout the grounds Some
may be helpful Some may misdirect
Its up to you to decide If by the
end of the weekend somebody is able
to name the murderer tell how they
accomplished it and what their motive
was you will win the game Any
questions

Blane with child-like excitement

BLANC
What do we win

Everyone looks at him Miles is caught of guard

MILES
I - what do you mean what do you -
what do you want

BLANC

Oh no Nothing I thought maybe there
was a prize or something I dont
know An iPad or

MILES
Fine winner gets an iPad ok

DUKE
Once youre dead will we still be
able to talk to you

MILES

Oh yeah Im not playing dead the
whole weekend ask me anything you
want but dont expect help from me

BLANC

I dont actually need an iPad I
just when you said win it made me
think

BIRDIE
Can we work together

34 34

MILES
Only one person can solve the crime
So if you have a theory keep it close
to your chest It is designed to be
hard it will take the whole weekend

BLANC
Truly delightful Have we started
already
MILES
Well the murder hasnt happened yet
but yeah -
BLANC
Ok Ok ok
Miles raises his glass
MILES

Why not as Watson said to Holmes -

BLANC
It was Birdie who planted a remote
device on the crossbow in revenge for
you stealing her signature wren
diamond

Blanc grins broadly with a did I get it gesture A beat
of silence The smile on Miless face calcifies and dies

BLANC (contd)
See the seating arrangement it
triangulates Birdie perfectly to that
thing -

A crystal suit of armor holding a working crossbow leveled
at the dining table

BLANC (contd)
- which is loaded with a dummy bolt
and aimed straight at Mr Bron I
believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering
device but more damning thats a
vintage Jayhawk brand crossbow
Jayhawk Birdie Jay

(MORE)

34 34
BLANC (contd)
Of course there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues - the
hedgerows in the south garden spell
the letter B her room is the sacral
chakra which is the one blocked by
guilt blah blah blah but the motive
yes now the motive On the cleverly
planted 1998 issue of The Face with
Birdie on the cover she famously wore
what became known as the wren
diamond - a family heirloom I
believe

BIRDIE
And so to be clear back then I
didnt even know what a blood
diamond was - so

But Blanc is on a mighty roll

BLANC
Mr Bron The large pendulous locket
which has not left your neck its a
bit out of keeping with your breezy
island style would you kindly open
it for us

Staring daggers Miles opens the silver locket and a large
cut DIAMOND falls out into his palm The table GASPS

BIRDIE
My wren diamond

BLANC
A dramatic passionate and colorful
crime for a fashionista Ms Birdie
But unfortunately this crime
clashed with the presence of
Benoit Blanc

With nailed it joy he turns to Miles and grins broadly
Miles stares at him dead-eyed

A little whirr from the crossbow prop and a theatrical
crossbow bolt FLIPS UP from a slit in Miless shirt with an
anticlimactic SNAP Fake blood dribbles out

The glass on the Mona Lisa SHHHTICKs shut

INT THE GLASS ONION - EVENING 35

Miless office in the center of the elevated glass
enclosure with spectacular views in all directions

Miles storms in Blanc following him still giddy

BLANC

My god that felt so good that just
felt solid So satisfying Just -
like a mini crossword the Times

has - or - I have a chef friend and
she speaks of trying to create the
perfect bite - that felt like the
perfect satisfying - bite sized

Miles just stares the crossbow bolt still protruding from
his chest He picks up a loose iPad from his desk and tosses
it over to Blanc

BLANC (contd)
Youre angry

MILES

(angry)
No Im not angry Blanc but you know
What the hell This was not a simple
thing to do to set up

(getting angrier)
I hired Gillian Flynn to help come up
with the whole thing

BLANC
Shes quite good

MILES
Shes goddamn expensive is what she
is What are we going to do now play
Yahtzee all weekend

Blanc looks at Miles and his demeanor changes as if hes
now dropping an act

BLANC
Mr Bron the truth is I ruined your
game on purpose and for a very good
reason

Miles looks at him curious What is this

BLANC (contd)
I like the glass onion as a metaphor
an object that seems densely layered
but in reality the center is in plain
sight Your relationships with these
people may seem complex but look at
the center look at what youve done
this weekend its crystal clear
you have taken seven people each of
whom has a real life reason to wish
you harm gathered them together on a
remote island and placed the idea of
your murder in their heads Its like
putting a loaded gun on the table and
turning off the lights

MILES
Oh Come On

BLANC
So you played hardball with Lionel
Threatened to destroy his reputation
if he does not play along and power a
manned rocket with klear

Miles looks at him solidly

BLANC (contd)
And with Claire too Perhaps you
threatened to support her opponent in
the upcoming election if she doesnt
approve your power plant

MILES
Youve done some homework

BLANC
Birdie Bangladesh Sweetie Pants are
manufactured there in a sweat shop
Youre making Birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main
investor

(beat)

And Duke Well We all know why Duke
wants to kill you

MILES
He doesnt know about that

BLANC
Yeeeeesss he does
(MORE)

BLANC (contd)

(beat)

Take my presence as a sign -
something is happening here beneath
the surface For at least one person
on this island this is not a game

Blanc spots a frame on the wall - mounted inside are two

objects on red backing

A faded NAPKIN with a sim

ple diagram drawn on it in pen

And a POLAROID PICTURE of Miles and Andi ten years younger
holding the napkin (though its blown out by the flash) ina
Flanking them is a young Duke Lionel Claire and
Birdie Above them all a neon sign THE GLASS ONION

BLANC (contd)
This is the famous napkin Ive heard
this story

MILES

I scribbled down the original idea
for Alpha on that napkin That night
with Andi at the Glass Onion That

Andis smiling face in the photo Blanc with weight

MILES (contd)

billionaire

The gang in the photo smiling flash-lit one moment

MILES (contd)
God I miss that bar

Blanc can see Miles going to a sad dark place

36 INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 36

Miless empty whiskey tumbler on the table Claire stares at

She lowers her eyes And walks out

He picks up his phone and buries himself in it angrily

Miles and Blanc breeze in

MILES
Thats what Im talking about

Lionels smile has vanished

LIONEL
Miles

MILES
On your feet genius

Claire stands in horror 36

CLAIRE
Miles - Duke

They all turn - Duke grasps at his throat staggering his
face purple For a horrible moment nobody moves

Duke drops his crystal tumbler and falls to his knees
Whiskey SCREAMS
Pandemonium erupts Everyone scrambling trying to help -

Lionel lays the convulsing Duke on his back Blanc reaches
into his mouth to clear his airway

CLAIRE BIRDIE

Is he choking Get him water Give him air
BLANC MILES

No hes not choking Duke buddy

Dukes eyes bulge beet red his chest heaves up in a final
horrible convulsion and then very suddenly stops Frozen
eyes open

Lionel tries chest compressions and mouth to mouth but
everyone backs away somehow aware that its over

Whiskey throws herself on Duke as Lionel backs off in
shock Blanc checks Dukes pulse Nothing

BLANC
Im afraid Mr Cody is dead

PEG
What the hell just happened

BIRDIE
Oh my god oh my god

CLAIRE
hat happened Did he choke on
something what happened

BLANC

There was no obstruction in his
airway We wont know the exact cause
of death without an autopsy but
Mr Bron will you call your boat and
have them come immediately Mr Bron

Miles has sunk into a chair and looks catatonic just
staring at Duke in shock

36 36

LIONEL

Ill do it - how do I do it
MILES

(murmurs)

Theres aaRadio room through

there
BLANC

Tell them we need medical personnel
and police

Lionel dashes off Blanc pulls Whiskey gently away from

Dukes body

She breaks down in sobs and slips out

BLANC (contd)
I must insist that nobody touch the
body or disturb anything around it

MILES
Wait - police

MILES (contd)
Are you - are you treating this as a
crime scene

CLAIRE
Oh my god I cant be here this is
bad - I can see the headlines

PEG
The police always come its standard

CLAIRE
Jetting off to Greece during a
pandemic with a mens rights you-
tuber who dies oh GOD Im gonna puke

MILES
No no no Blanc - are you saying you
think this was intentional

BLANC
I dont know
(beat)
But Mr Codys death was so acute and
violent my guess would be something
was put in his drink Intentionally

A beat while this sinks in

INT RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS 37

Lionel on a sleek communications computer tied to the
mainland he speaks to the boat captain Mr Andino

LIONEL
Whadayamean morning thats - how is
that possible

ANDINO (ON RADIO)
Pee-cha-chite Dock pee-cha-chite

LIONEL
(dawning)
Peesh - of - shite Oh

INT LOUNGE AREA 38
Lionel runs in

LIONEL
The boat cant come till low tide
In the morning Six am at the
earliest

CLAIRE BLANC
What Did you explain the
situation

LIONEL

Theres no other landing point and
Miless dumb-ass Banksy dock was set
to low tide height and it isnt
buoyant Its a piece of shit

BLANC

Alright I suggest we all retire to
our rooms and keep the doors locked
until five thirty when we will
convene here and walk together to the
dock I will stay up all night with
the body to make sure it isnt
tampered with in any way Id
recommend everyone get some sleep

As Blanc is saying this Miles looks at Claire placing a
blanket over Dukes contorted face

Then he sees something else

The sound in the room goes fuzzy His peripheral vision
blurs Everything focuses on one object and what it means

38

The crystal tumbler that Duke drank from and dropped On the
floor by his hand

The name beautifully etched in its side
MILES

MILES
Ohhhhhhh that is

Miles points in horror and everyone looks

BIRDIE
Thats your glass Miles

Blanc kneels looks at the tumbler Then looks back at
Miles who barely breathes

MILES
He he must have he picked it up
by mistake

FLASHBACK - As Miles cheers on Birdie spinning in her dress
Duke reaches without looking for his glass and grabs Miless
instead

BACK TO SCENE - Miles looks at the faces around the room
like a frightened child

Instinctively he moves behind Blanc as if for protection

BLANC
Mr Bron

LIONEL
Miles come on now

CLAIRE
Miles its us

BIRDIE
Miles baby for real

A beat looking them all over and then to Blanc

MILES
I will pay you one billion dollars to
find who tried to kill me

EVERYONE

(come ON)
Miles

38 38

DING SHHHHTICK Blanc sighs weary

BLANC
Im just going to silence his phone

When he steps away from Miles Miles moves behind the sofa

MILES
Were staying right here in this
room Im keeping you all in plain
sight until that boat comes

LIONEL
For godssakes Miles -
MILES
Wait wheres Whiskey
(oh NO)

Wheres Andi

He spins as if afraid someones behind him jumpy and
petrified

BLANC
Wheres Dukes phone

PEG
It just dinged we heard it

BLANC
But it it isnt in his pockets

PEG
Maybe he dropped it somewhere if it
dings again well find it

Lionel steps forward gravely points

LIONEL
Forget his phone look
Blanc lifts Dukes jacket His hip holster empty
BIRDIE

Wheres his stupid gun

BLANC
Oh fiddle sticks

(suddenly very afraid)
When did his gun disappears

LIONEL
He always has his gun 38
BLANC
He always has it which means we
stopped seeing it but at some point
this evening it was gone We need to
find Andi

Miles goes into full panic mode scampering around the room
trying to take cover in a wide open space

A distant DONG SHHHHTICK Miles jumps a foot
BLANC (contd)
Mr Bron Its alright - its just the
Phillip Glass thing

If its possible Miles grows three shades more ashen

MILES
Oh no

Checks his watch - 10pm

MILES (contd)
Oh no oh no oh SHIT oh no NO NO

CLAIRE
Miles calm down

BLANC
Mr Bron Whats the matter

Miles grabs Blancs lapel full panic babbling -

MILES
It was part of the game it was the
game the murder game we were going
to be having drinks and I thought it
would be fun to say something
dramatic just at ten oclock and then
have twenty minutes where oh god
Blanc help help help help

Blanc SLAPS him firmly

BLANC
What happens at ten oclock

With a hollow SNAP every light in the entire complex SHUTS
OFF plunging the atrium into total darkness

EXT THE GLASS ONION - NIGHT 39

The entire complex goes dark A moment later the islands
lighthouse SWEEPS its hard white light across the grounds

INT ATRIUM - NIGHT 40

Pitch black just splinters of shapes from the moonlit
windows

The white light of the lighthouse SWEEPS the room and like
a strobe light catching a single frame of a tableau we see
Miles on his knees arms wrapped around Blancs legs
everyone else scattered around the room

MILES
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Then all is black again We hear voices in the dark -

CLAIRE
Lionel
LIONEL
Im here
DING SHHHHTICK
BIRDIE

Ah Peg is that you

PEG
No Im here wheres my phone it has
a flashlight -

Above it all Miles whimpering in a panicked whine

MILES
I gotta - I cant be -

BLANC
Everybody calm down Stand still Do
not panic

With the next FLASH of light Whiskey stumbles in holding
(for some reason) a SPEAR FISHING GUN

WHISKEY
IT WAS ANDI SHE KILLED DUKE AND TORE
OUR ROOM APART I SAW HER

40

LIONEL
WHAT

Miles shrieks

MILES
NOT TODAY

And RUNS
BLANC
Mr Bron Oh for hells bells -
Everybody STAY HERE

Blanc dashes after him

INT HALLWAYS - NIGHT Al
Miles runs stops listening - eyes darting everywhere

As the light SWEEPS the blackened hall we see Miles in the
distance turn a corner In the foreground ANDI spotting

him

Somewhere far away

BLANC (0OS)
Andi

She looks back at Blancs voice as the light catches her

INT ATRIUM - NIGHT 42

In the darkness Pegs phone flashlight comes on Its weak
light doesnt pierce the vast space but she waves it
around

PEG
Bird I got it - Birdie Lionel

No one answers The light sweeps the vast room - Peg is
alone

PEG (contd)
Guys

NT HALLWAYS - NIGHT 43
With Miles Moving slowly in the darkness Barely breathing
LIGHT SWEEPS Shadows in the hallway - hard to tell what

they are He slows his breath listening

The darkness looms around him

NT KITCHEN - NIGHT 44
Blanc enters just as a dark shape exits

BLANC
Whos that

No answer footsteps pad away Using his phone flashlight to
peer around he spots the butchers block on the kitchen
island One knife obviously missing

BLANC (contd)
Lord helps us

The light sweeps revealing a shadow of a running figure on

the wall He turns - someone just ran past the window
outside

EXT GROUNDS - NIGHT 45

Blanc runs outside turns - and is almost RUN OVER by the
running figure Andi In the jostle we think we hear

BLANC
Hello

Andi runs in to Blanc

BLANC (contd)
Did you take Dukes gun

ANDI
Why would I take Dukes gun And why
are the lights -

BLANC
Duke is dead

ANDI
What

INT HALL - NIGHT 46

Dark Through the floor to ceiling windows we see but dont
hear Blanc and Andi right outside talking fast and low

The light SWEEPS

Revealing held in the foreground by a gloved hand - DUKES
GUN

In the darkness that follows a shape moves A silhouette
silent against the moonlit window

The figure raises an arm
The shape of Dukes gun held out steady

The figure takes very careful aim at the two outside

EXT GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS 47

Blanc and Andi oblivious the window pitch black behind
them

ANDI
I dont understand -

BLANC
Please trust me its all in plain
sight I only need one last piece of
information and only you can -
BANG
Several things happen at once

The window behind them cracks like safety glass splintering
out like a spider web from a central bullet hole

Andis body flies out of frame as if hit by a hammer

INT THE GLASS ONION 48

In empty halls rooms the gunshot echoes and reverberates

INT ATRIUM 49
SHHHHTICK The glass slides down over the Mona Lisa just as

the light sweeps over her Linger on her enigmatic face
Maybe smiling maybe not its hard to tell

49

We stay on it as we hear footsteps throughout the distant
halls and echoey voices

CLAIRE (0S)

Lionel
BIRDIE (0OS) LIONEL (0S)
Guys Where are you Did you I heard it Im here -
hear that
PEG (0S) LIONEL (0OS)
That sounded like Oh god Miles - whos seen

Miles is he ok

The sweeping light FLASH takes us to

EXT GROUNDS 50
The light sweeps over Andis crumpled form on the steps

Blanc backs off breathing hard a moment suspended Deep
regret and anger turning to resolution in his eyes

With a deep clank the LIGHTS come back on in the entire
complex

In the windows behind him one by one everyone appears
looking down on the tableau Blanc standing above Andis
awkwardly twisted body her chest exploded in red

And high above them all in the front facing window of the
glass onion Miles Bron looks down

MOMENTS LATER
Everyone runs out each stopping in horror at Andis body

CLAIRE
Oh god

She reels Lionel steadies her Birdie shrieks and steps
behind Peg who is in shock Whiskey sits on the steps

numb Inside the hallway Miles stops at the gun on the

floor Walks out to Blanc

Gathering himself he turns forceful and hard

BLANC
Everyone inside Right now

Claire motions to the body

50

CLAIRE
Shouldnt we -

A cold fury has taken Blanc He storms inside
BLANC
Shes not going anywhere Inside
Its time to finish this
INT ATRIUM - NIGHT 51
Blanc sweeps in everyone struggling to keep up
BLANC
Peg radio the mainland Tell them to
send the boats NOW Banksy be damned
beach them if they have to

She nods and goes to do it

MILES
Andi
WHISKEY
She killed Duke why would -
BLANC
No
MILES

This makes no sense

BLANC
Youre wrong it all makes perfect
sense Duke Andi This weekend this
ridiculous game that started well
before we set foot on this island

LIONEL
Will you please then explain it all
to us Detective

BLANC
No I can peel back the layers I can
take it to a point But what lies at
the center only one person can
tell us who killed Cassandra Brand

HARD CUT TO

A FRONT DOOR PAINTED WHITE

A hand knocks A long moment Knocks again insistent A
voice we maybe recognize from inside

BLANC (0S)

Get that would you

PHILLIP (0OS)

Youre not in the bath again are

you

No

BLANC
(to Phillip guilty)

A beat then the door swings open revealing a handsome

middle aged man
standing in the
face

named PHILLIP He blinks at the woman
hall grabs a mask and pulls it over his

We recognize her as Andi wearing an N95 mask and with
longer hair Her speaking voice is a little softer with a
distinct southern lilt her posture a bit more slouched
She awkwardly holds a familiar large cardboard BOX

PHILLIP

Yep Can I help you

AND
Is this Benoit Blancs residence
PHILLIP
Uh what is this regarding
AND
Im sorry its just his office is
closed and I really need to speak
to him Its urgent Please

(beat)

And this is not unheavy

PHILLIP

Blanc There is someone here for you
With a box

EXT TERRACE - DAY

Blancs apartment has a terrace with an outdoor dining table

and a few chairs The cardboard box sits on the table in

front of Blanc
still masked

Andi stands at the far end of the table

53

Blanc pulls the top of the box off revealing the shattered
splintered remains of the puzzle box

BLANC
Why dont we start at the beginning

Her mask Blanc nods and they both unmask

ANDI
My name is Helen Brand

Oh

HELEN
I came all the way here from Alabama

A pause She is obviously nervous Blanc gently

BLANC
What do you do in Alabama

HELEN

I teach third grade So a lotta
zooming Been getting into tie-dying
with the pandemic That doesnt
matter Mr Blanc two days ago I
received a call

INT MORGUE - FLASHBACK 54

Helen has been brought in to identify the body on a
stretcher A kind CORONER lifts the sheet

HELEN (0OC)
My sister committed suicide In her
garage in her car with the engine
running

Helen nods mouths yes and steps away quickly Reveal the

body on the stretcher Its Andi Helens identical twin
with the shorter hair were used to seeing her with

EXT TERRACE 55
HELEN

My sister was Cassandra Brand Do you
know who she was

BLANC
Yes of course I thought you
sorry I thought you looked familiar
An impressive woman your sister

HELEN

You know she kept a diary every day
of her life since she was six know
what she called it Notes for future
biographers Biographers plural
Girl was six years old Day after
high school she shot off to New York
never looked back You know When we
were kids wed goof together wed do
a character rich bitch

(in Andis accent)
Heavens the dog ate the caviar
again Then one day I hear her doing
a talk and thats just how she talks
now Rich bitch I was like who are
you fooling girl Everyone but me
But she had the brains and guts for
both of us I was happy just watching
her use them

BLANC
(gently steering)
So you get the call

Helen looking at the box on the table

HELEN
Yeah I get it I fly here this is
yesterday Im cleaning out Andis
house Its a mess All her books
everywhere And Im thinking about my
sister and what got taken from her
and how I wasnt there for her and
m getting angrier and angrier and
then theres a knock at the door
ts a courier he hands me this
thing From Miles Bron Theres
probably some clever way to open it
dunno I open it Its an
invitation to his private island in
Greece next weekend one of these
trips shed go on with him and this
little group of shitheads that she
thought were her friends Called
themselves the disruptors I knew
what they were I told her Shit
Heads 55

Helen

Blanc

Helen

Blanc

Helen

Blanc

s anger is simmering
nods not impatiently but ready for the point

BLANC
Miss Brand what can I do for you

nods And takes the plunge

HELEN
Andi didnt commit suicide

leans back engaged

HELEN (contd)
She didnt leave any kind of note so
I was going through her computer
looking through the SENT box to see
if she wrote anyone anything

pulls her phone opens an email hands it to Blanc

HELEN (contd)
She sent this at four pm the day she
was murdered Four days ago

looks at the email reads it aloud

BLANC
I finally found it its right here
and Im going to use it to burn his
whole empire down Im giving you all
one last chance to make things right
You know where to find me -A

The email has a picture attached of Andi in her home office
holding a sealed file-sized RED MANILA ENVELOPE up to her
computers camera

BLANC (contd)
And these four addresses she sent it
to I would assume are

HELEN
Birdie Jay Duke Cody Claire Debella
and Lionel Toussaint

BLANC
The shit heads

HELEN
She sends that email Nothing back
from any of them
(MORE) 55
HELEN (contd)
And the next day shes dead in her
garage Heavy dose of sleeping pills
in her system I have emptied every
inch of every room of her house and
guess what isnt there

Blanc looks at the picture of Andi with the red envelope

BLANC

The red envelope
(beat)
Compelling

Helens face tightens

HELEN

Google said you were the worlds
greatest detective I came to you
Not the police Someone like me takes
something like this to a group of
rich folk with an army of lawyers

A pause

BLANC

But if you got them all together
isolated for a weekend with in your
words the worlds greatest
detective

His eyes gleam Helens face breaks in relief

BLANC (contd)
You want to hire me to go to that
island

HELEN
Its a stupid idea right

BLANC
I want to be clear - I am not Batman

She blinks

BLANC (contd)
I can find the truth I can deduce
gather evidence present it to the
police and the courts - but thats
where my jurisdiction ends

HELEN

Yeah but you doing it instead of me
Ill take those odds

55 55

Blanc draws a long thin cigar from his pocket and clips the
end now seeing it deep in thought

BLANC
I have not seen your sisters death
in the news did you release a
statement

HELEN
No - shit was I supposed to I dont
know how this works

BLANC
And you have no other family member
who was informed of the death If I
pulled some strings I could keep it
from leaking to the press for another

week maybe yes a fascinating
challenge and it could work
but oh yes Oh oh thats
outrageous Well now Yes Wow
but yes

(Helen stares at him)

Ms Brand any feelings of reverence
or respect you had for me when you
crossed my threshold buttress those
feelings now buttress them Im
proposing you come with me to that
island As your sister As Cassandra

Brand

HELEN
What Im hiring you to go Im not
Whoa What Are you insane

BLANC
Buttress now yes A famous detective
shows up and out of the blue pokes
the subject of your sister theyll
shut up like a clam Your presence on
that island is the essential
catalyst

HELEN
Oh come on

BLANC
Buttress

HELEN

Im trying real hard to buttress but
this sounds nuts

55 55
BLANC
Indeed But its the only way this
works
HELEN

Helen starts

A long beat

This is something Andi would do
Shes the smart one shes the actor
This isnt me look at me theyll
know Im not her

BLANC
You cut your hair wear her clothes

HELEN
You think Ill fit in that shit And
what about my hair

BLANC
I know a guy Listen Why would
anyone suspect youre showing up
playing your sister when they dont
know your sister is dead

to get it

HELEN

Right They dont know Andis dead
they wont suspect And youd do the
inspecting

BLANC
Yes I will you just have to be
there

HELEN
Mr Blanc So this is gonna be safe

BLANC

(suddenly realizes

grave)
No No - one person will know the
truth about you From the moment you
arrive on that island the killer will
know who you are and what youre
doing They will certainly not
hesitate to kill again if it covers
their tracks And Im a detective
Helen not a bodyguard Its too
dangerous Im sorry Helen I cant
help you

We think Helen might leave But then

55 55

HELEN

One of those shit heads killed my

sister

She looks down at the broken puzzle box angry

HELEN (contd)

Do you really think we could get the

son of a bitch

Blancs grave eyes gleam He ignites his cigar

CUT TO

Push in on the adorable dock-side hotel lit up warm and
glowing

58 EXT HOTEL TERRACE —- NIGHT 58

Tables set up on a front terrace Helen disguised as Andi
steps out the front door She spots Blanc at a table
flipping through an iPad She goes and sits with him

BLANC
Well my goodness

HELEN
(beat)
I shouldnt be here this is nuts
But Im here so lets do this
A server sweeps in

BLANC

HELEN
I dont drink - just coffee

The server seems confused then suddenly seems to understand
and rushes off very excited

HELEN (contd)
Andis journals

BLANC

Tomorrow Ill go out early and you
should arrive late so I can watch
everyones reaction when you show up
On the boat be cold dont engage in
conversation

HELEN

BLANC
Youll be fine Remember rich bitch
voice Andi posture

Helen corrects her usual slouch does her rich bitch
accent for most of the rest of the conversation

small

old school iPod Nano

HELEN
Yes I put her TED Talks on this
thing listening to them the dog at
the caviar You said you were going
to research these people for
motives - did you find anything

BLANC
Yes I did but motives for each of
them to want Miles Bron dead Why
would they kill her to protect him
Just dont get it

HELEN
What about Miles What if Miles just
did it

BLANC

She shows a

e

We cant rule it out but - Miles Bron

is not an idiot To risk committing
murder after a very public court
case with the possibility that
Andis email could come to light
it would be an exceedingly stupid
thing to do Especially if someone
was willing to do it for him Now
walk me through these journals -

HELEN
Kay Ten years ago before any of
them hit it big they all hung out
together in this bar
INT THE GLASS ONION BAR - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

The Glass Onion neon sign glows in a dive bar Andi

Birdie Duke Claire and Lionel all hang out drinking ina

booth all young and broke and buzzed Andi is the warm
center of the group

BLANC (OC)
And Miles was the leader of the pack

HELEN (0OC)
No Andi was They all were friends
with Andi Birdie was a washed up
model Duke was a nerd doing video
game tournaments Claire just lost a
race for city council Lionel was a
substitute teacher All of them run
aground in their thirties but Andi
saw their potential She found them
all Then she found Miles
Introduced him to the group

Andi sees Miles enter waves him over to the booth

ANDI
Guys This is Miles

Time cut later in the conversation Miles holds court

HELEN (0OS)
At first nobody liked him He would
say stuff like

MILES
I want to be responsible for

Claire well done

HELEN
Are those motives I was kinda
confused

BLANC

Yes both of them - theyve bet the
farm and will both be ruined along

EXT POOL 82

With Helen Listening as Miles gives his discourse on
disruption As he speaks we stay on her face moving with
her as she approaches the group

MILES (0S)
Theyll tell you to stop that you
need to stop Because as it turns
out nobody wants you to break the
system itself That is true
disruption That is what unites this
group Every single one of us has hit
that point and proved that theyre
willing to cross it

Helen takes a last long pull from the hard kombucha
straightens her posture then claps

Blanc and the rest of the group turns to look at her
Blancs face Uh oh

CUT TO

EXT GROUNDS - AFTERNOON 83

Helen bursts onto a path away from the pool hyped up She
steadies herself the trees spinning

HELEN
Uh oh

Behind her Claire runs to catch up

CLAIRE
Wait

Helen takes one breath - here we go - then spins on her

HELEN
Wait YOU wait That day in court you
couldnt even look me in the eye

Claire just looks at her hard up and down appraising her
Helen holds her gaze Fear grips her like someone whos
made a bad bluff

CLAIRE
What are you doing

This is steely It freezes Helen The moment is broken when
Duke emerges from the pool area joining them Standing by
silently Claire looks at him Back to Helen

CLAIRE (contd)
Can we talk about the email

HELEN
Oh now you want to talk about it

CLAIRE

trying to keep it all straight in her

HELEN
Can you say all that one more time

85

CLAIRE
Look I dont know what youre
planning on pulling being here but we
need to talk about this

Then Helen has a moment of clarity she knows what she wants
to ask

HELEN

If I had answered the door that
night what would you have told me

(to Claire)
That you were wrong That youll back
me up with Miles Or were you all
showing up to talk me out of using
that envelope

Claire doesnt reply and Helen has her answer and takes
the opportunity to storm off

Claire watches her go Duke scowls and leaves

Lionel emerges behind Claire sees Helen vanishing into the
gardens

CLAIRE
Somethings off What is she playing
at
EXT GARDEN 86

The adrenaline carries Helen about eight steps before she
swoons and stumbles From nearby

SOOTHING ROBOT VOICE (0OS)
This is a smokeless garden

Red lights flash through the trees she takes a defensive
posture so confused

SOOTHING ROBOT VOICE (0S) (contd)
Please keep our water clean

She sees Blanc dash out from the foliage panicked She
calls to him

HELEN

Birdie came late

On her note pad she ticks off the O for Birdie and Duke

BLANC
But they could have gotten there
early killed your sister then
circled away and waited for the other
to arrive

HELEN
Shit

She ticks off Claire and Lionels O boxes

BLANC
Something something is teasing the
edge of my brain This case confounds
me

HELEN

Well we dont have motives for Duke
or Birdie so -

Behind them we realize the picture of Serena Williams is not
a picture at all but live video He looks up from his book

SERENA WILLIAMS (ON SCREEN)
Hey do either of you two want to do
a session

They look up startled

SERENA WILLIAMS (ON SCREEN) (contd)

A CLACK and whirrrr from off-screen draws Blancs attention

BLANC
Oh not right now

Serena Williams goes back to his book with a shrug

SERENA WILLIAMS (ON SCREEN)
Alright Its your money

Blanc goes to the source of the noise - a FAX MACHINE in the
corner spitting a sheet out into a huge bin Helen goes
with him still bracing herself

BLANC
One number all his machines

Blanc gets very excited and digs through the bin flipping
through the pages fast then stopping and drawing one out
He shows it to Helen

HELEN

top

BLANC
From that afternoon just minutes
after she sent the email

Helen groans Then sits up the bullet hole in her chest
smoking She and Blanc look at each other confused

And pulls Andis journal from her jacket pocket the slug
embedded in its front

HELEN
Son of a bitch ah - Blanc what are
you doing go Go chase them get
them - Blanc

Blancs face is frozen as his mind races He looks from
Helen to the broken window to the Glass Onion above them

BLANC
The killer thinks youre dead This
is our cover
As if in a trance he reaches into his jacket pocket

And pulls out the bottle of JEREMY RENNERS HOT SAUCE

Helen sees him do this Then with laser focus

BLANC (contd)

I can buy you maybe five minutes
alone in the Glass Onion and you
have to

HELEN
I will

BLANC
You HAVE to find that envelope

HELEN
I will gimme -

She grabs the bottle from him he backs off as she twists
off the top splashes it all over her chest and lies back
playing dead She realizes she still has the hot sauce in
her hand goes to toss it -

BLANC
Wait No give me that - thisll be
good

He takes it from her rubs a dab under each eye pockets it
His eyes redden and tear up - perfect - but in another few
seconds hes clutching his face in pain

BLANC (contd)
Oh SHITBALLS 106

HELEN
Blanc

BLANC
Yes

He pulls it together Breathes through the pain
SNAP The lights come on Everyone appears in the windows
CLOSE UP Helens face Hot sauce runs into her nose and she

tries desperately to keep still as in the background the
scene plays out

Q

LATRE
Oh god

BLANC
Everyone inside Right now

CLAIRE
Shouldnt we -

BLANC
Shes not going anywhere Inside
Its time to finish this

The instant theyre gone Helen GETS UP and DASHES inside

INT HALLWAYS - NIGHT 107

Helen silently dodges through the hallways and up a set of
stairs Down the hall we hear distant

MILES
It makes no sense

BLANC (0OS)
It makes perfect sense Duke Andi
this weekend this ridiculous game
that started well before we got to
this island

INT LOUNGE AREA - CONTINUOUS 108
The suspects gathered Blanc doing his thing
LIONEL

Will you explain it to us then
Detective

108

BLANC
No I can peel back the layers I can
take it to a point but what lies at
the center only one person can tell
us who killed Cassandra Brand

CLAIRE
WHO

BLANC
(beat)
I keep returning in my mind to the
glass onion

INT THE GLASS ONION - NIGHT 109

Helen bursts into the large office space Nearly everything
is made of lucite or glass there are nearly no containers
or places to stash a large red envelope

We hear the continuation of Blancs denouement clearly as
if its voice over

BLANC (OC)
Something that seems densely layered
mysterious and inscrutable but in
fact the center is in plain sight

Helen darts around the room but its all infuriatingly
clean and open

HELEN
Where where where where

INT LOUNGE AREA 110

BLANC
And that is why this case has
confounded me like no other why
every complex layer peeled back has
revealed another layer and another
layer and come to naught And that
was the problem

INT THE GLASS ONION 111

Helen looks up and sees something freezes The framed
NAPKIN and PHOTO of her sister and Miles

111
BLANC (OC)
You see I expected complexity I
expected intelligence I expected a
puzzle a game but that is not what
any of this is
She steps towards it as if in a trance
The photo and napkin Framed Against a red background
BLANC (0OS)
It hides not behind complexity but
behind mind numbing obvious clarity
Truth is it does not hide at all I
was staring right at it
She pulls it off the wall and the red envelope FALLS onto
the table beneath it The frame itself is clear just like
everything else in the room
She holds them both the framed napkinpicture in one hand
the red envelope in the other
INT LOUNGE AREA 112
BLANC
The killer nearly struck my Achilles
heel But thank high heaven at the
last moment I realized what has
teased my brain through this entire
case
He spins on his heel to Miles
BLANC (contd)
Embreathiate is not a word
LIONEL
What
EXT BEACH - FLASHBACK - DAY 113
When they all first arrived Miles
MILES
Lets all embreathiate this moment
INT LOUNGE AREA
BLANC
Not a real word Kinda sounds like
one But just entirely made up
Reclamation IS a word - but it is
the wrong word
EXT THE GLASS ONION - FLASHBACK - DAY
When Miles is first showing them around

This entire day -

Blanc points out the window

BLANC
Thats the Aegean sea

CLAIRE
Oh wait yeah it is

BLANC

His dock doesnt float his wonder
fuel is a disaster his grasp of
disruption theory is remedial at
best he didnt design the puzzle
boxes he didnt write the mystery -
and voila it all adds up the key to
this entire case and it was staring
me right in the face Like everyone
in the world I assumed that Miles
Bron was a complicated genius But
why Look into the clear center of
this glass onion

(beat)

Miles Bron is an idiot

Everyone shifts uncomfortably Miles rolls his eyes

MILES
Oh please Just tell us who tried to
kill me

BLANC

Nobody tried to kill you you
vainglorious buffoon

MILES
But Duke Duke took my glass

BLANC
Thats what you told us he did he

must have picked it up by mistake
you told us right after it happened

122

FLASHBACK - As Miles cheers on Birdie spinning in her dress
Duke reaches without looking for his glass and grabs Miless
instead

Back to scene

BLANC (contd)
After you said those words thats
what we all remember seeing But
think ignore his lies everyone and
think clearly now - what did we all
actually see

FLASHBACK - This is the actual piece of footage that
originally happened the same angle the same take
everything - As Birdie spins in her dress in the foreground
in the background Miles openly and clearly HANDS HIS GLASS
TO DUKE

Back to scene

BLANC (contd)
You handed Duke your own glass
Clear as crystal Right in front of
our eyes All of us Then told a bald
faced fabrication And it worked
LIONEL
Blanc Are you saying Miles murdered
Duke
BLANC
Yes
LIONEL
Why
BLANC

Because the night Andi sent you all
the email when Duke got to Andis
house early on his motorcycle -

EXT ANDIS HOUSE - FLASHBACK - EVENING 123

Duke zipping down the road he is almost PLOWED OVER by
Miles in his distinctive blue Porsche

BLANC (0C)
He saw Miles leaving Was almost
struck by him

Miles doesnt stop but keeps zooming off Duke watches
go shaking his head then continues to Andis house

BLANC (0S)

In fact he told all of us right out
in the open clear as day he told us -

EXT POOL - FLASHBACK - DAY

him

The painting of the Porsche on the wall The mix is a TINY
bit different this time and we clearly hear Duke complete

his sentence over Miles cutting him off

DUKE MILES

road that night at Andis Anderson Coopers birthday

INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT

Birdie SCREAMS

Miles stands looking at Helen pale But Helen calmly paces
into the room holding the frame and the red envelope

BLANC
Who did the envelope threaten Miles
Bron
INT AEROSPACE FACTORY - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON 126

Lionel looks around guiltily feeding a printout of Andis
email into a FAX machine

BLANC (OC)
That night Lionel faxed Andis email
to Miles
INT NEW YORK PENTHOUSE - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON 127

Miles in a robe receives it reading it troubled

BLANC (OC)
Who received it in New York

The one thing that can destroy his
empire of lies the truth In the
hands of the only person unafraid to
tell it

EXT ANDIS HOUSE ROAD - FLASHBACK - LATE AFTERNOON

Miles flies down the country road in his Porsche
BLANC (OC)
So Miles drives his baby blue

INT ATRIUM
Blanc stares you idiot daggers at Miles
BLANC
his one of a kind signature baby

EXT ANDIS HOUSE - FLASHBACK - LATE AFTERNOON
Miless car parked out front
BLANC (0C)
And she let him in

INT ANDIS KITCHEN - FLASHBACK - LATE AFTERNOON

Miles at Andis kitchen table both drinking tea
gently beseeching She watches him coldly

BLANC (0C)

He talks

Of course she did Miless machine of

lawyers and power could burn her
through sheer dumb force but Miles

himself She was clever enough to not

fear Miles

Andis head droops She looks up at Miles as her

consciousness slips from her grasp and she realizes what is

happening

BLANC
No She did not see the real threat
the obvious threat until it was too
late

But Miles has become distracted By a spider on the table
He gently scoops it up and lets it out an open window

131

BLANC (contd)
And one final time she was pulled
in And succumbed

One glint of horrible realization in her eyes And she slips
away her head hitting the table

INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 132

Miles looks from Helen tears of rage in her eyes to Blanc
with a blankness that is terrifying

BLANC

Duke alone knew you were there that
night But he didnt know Andi was
dead He didnt know that until
this evening Right here When he got
a google alert on his phone which
has now fallen strangely silent And
which he showed to you

(beat)
Because you dont own a phone

On Miless thin jacket a very faint rectangular outline has
been visible since the lights came back on Blanc touches
it revealing a phone in Miless jacket pocket

Blanc takes it as Miles just stares A lion sticker on the
back of the phone

WHISKEY
Duke

FLASHBACK - As everyone gathers around Duke Miles
surreptitiously scoops up his fallen phone

BACK TO SCENE -

HELEN
Did Miles think he could stop them
all from finding out about Andis
death They all have phones

All the suspects who have been caught up in the moment
suddenly realize this and all pull out their phones at once
checking the news All but Birdie who reaches for hers but
still doesnt have it

BIRDIE
(to Peg)
Peggy Phone

132 132

PEG
(reading her phone)
No

BLANC
He didnt need to hide the death He
only had to hide that Duke had shown
him the death moments before he was
killed

133 INT LOUNGE AREA - FLASHBACK - EARLIER THAT NIGHT 133

Duke shows the phone to Miles but this time we see the news
story is about Andis death

BLANC (0C)
Right in the open Duke showed him

DUKE
This changes everything doesnt it

MILES
It sure does

BLANC (0C)
He showed him and told him what he
wanted in return for his silence

DUKE
Numbers like this maybe we can talk
Alpha News
Miles goes to the bar cart and fixes a drink hips swinging

MILES

Miles at the bar cart putting ice and whiskey in his glass
BLANC (OC)
And so what does Miles do
134 INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 134
HELEN
Does he keep a vial of poison in his

tooth or something is that a rich

The bar cart Miles quietly reaches for the can of

BIRDIE (0S)
and pineapple juice

He puts a tiny bit in the whiskey Looks up at Duke
BLANC (0S)

Yes Pineapple juice

136 INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 136

BLANC

An allergy

BIRDIE
So dumb its brilliant

BLANC

Lionel Claire and Peg all finish reading the news looking
from their phones to Helen

LIONEL
Survived by her sister Helen

CLAIRE

136 136

BIRDIE
Who Oh you told me about Helen
once your twin sister OH WAIT

Birdie points to Helen hand in front of her mouth finally
getting it

BLANC

Helen Brand ladies and gentlemen

(beat)
And now we come to Helens attempted
murder Which I have to give you
credit for though it was spur of the
moment it did have a sound
foundation of thought The lights go
out

137 INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 137

The light go out Miles in the dark But as he howls in
panic his eyes are calculating looking around

BLANC
And you realize the opportunity laid
out in front of you You have a house
on a remote island full of desperate
people all of whom have reason to
wish this woman harm

138 INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 138

Having said these words Blanc squints Hm But he plows on

BLANC
Furthermore
139 INT LOUNGE AREA - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 139
BLANC (OC)

you had a loaded gun conveniently
within reach

In the dark confusion Miles grabs Dukes gun

140 INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 140

Again Blanc narrows his eyes as if the words coming out of
his mouth are strange Slowly

INT HALLWAYS - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 141

Miles in the dark halls pocketing Dukes phone gun in
hand

BLANC (0OC)
and the lights had even been turned
off
INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 142
BLANC
OH MY GOD

Hes realized why all this sounded familiar

INT THE GLASS ONION - FLASHBACK - EVENING 143

The scene after Blanc ruined Miless game Blanc patiently
explains to Miles

BLANC

You have taken seven people each of
whom has a real life reason to wish
you harm gathered them together on a
remote island and placed the idea of
your murder in their heads Its like
putting a loaded gun on the table and
turning off the lights

INT LOUNGE AREA 144
He turns to Miles unbelieving
BLANC
Oh you brainless jackass Your one
murder with any panache at all and
you stole the whole idea from me
INT HALLWAYS - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 145

Blanc and Helen outside the window Miles in the foreground
raises Dukes gun and takes careful aim at Helen

FIRES

The glass SPLINTERS out from a central hole

INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT 146

Everyone in the room looking at Miles

LIONEL
And after all that you KEPT the
envelope Why didnt you burn it or

something

Miles looks blankly at him like a confused dog Blanc
gesticulates to Miles - I rest my case

Helen approaches Miles Pulls the real original NAPKIN from
the red envelope Older and yellowed The same diagram on it
as the framed one but in a different hand

HELEN
Recognize this Andis handwriting
Gotcha you son of a bitch

MILES
Ok lets slow down there sister -
First - How could you prove this is
the original She could have copied
mine -

HELEN
No because the bar closed nine years
ago And hers has one thing yours
doesnt

Helen moves her thumb revealing embossed in fading letters
on the corner the name of the bar THE GLASS ONION

Miles nods coolly

MILES
But second -

He ignites the LIGHTER in his hand An eight inch long thin
blue jet of flame leaps out

It spears the napkin Which IGNITES like flash paper and in
a fraction of a second is turned into a crisp of ash which
floats away

SHHHHTICK Down comes the Mona Lisa glass

Helen cant even move shocked Horrified

Miles turns points and smiles to Lionel like thanks for
that great idea

146 146

Blanc dashes up to Helen

BLANC
What did he do

HELEN
He burned it

MILES
Burned what That was so weird

HELEN
He just burned it

MILES
I dont see anything

BLANC
This will not stand -

MILES
Blanc did you see this proof No
Did anybody

Everyone looks at each other then back to him They arent
going to contradict him

MILES (contd)

Then WOW - weve got some wild
accusations of murder and deceit
with nothing but circumspective
evidence

Blanc flinches but bites his tongue

MILES (contd)
and dodgy memories of what we all
saw Now if we were playing my murder
mystery game which by the way is
what we should have just been doing
all weekend then Blanc wins an iPad
Pro this time But this is the real
world And in the real world you need
more than a neat little detective
story you need evidence And youve
got nothing Do you

Helen looks at Blanc panicked
BLANC
Hes right The contents of that

envelope and his possession of it
were our only physical evidence

146 146

Helen cant believe it She looks at Miles

MILES

You wanna take this to the cops The
courts Pick your poison Anywhere
you go Its your version of the
truth against mine Lets see how
that goes

(to Helen)
Probably about how it went for Andi
I do want to say that your sister was
a complicated woman and she meant the
world to me Im sorry for your loss

Silence Everyone in the room hates him right now but
everyone stays silent

HELEN
Nobodys stepping up Raise your
hand - I saw him at Andis that
night - I saw him grab Dukes
gun - I saw the napkin before he
burned it

CLAIRE
We didnt -

HELEN

You would lie for a lie you wont
lie for the truth Still on his
titties You shit heads

(in tears)
Blanc I need you to do something

Blanc approaches Helen He pauses only to pick up her

whiskey soda

He hands her

With strange

which still sits on a statue

BLANC
Im very sorry Helen But this is
where my jurisdiction ends I have to
answer to the police to the courts
The system There is nothing I can
do But maybe offer you courage

the drink

BLANC (contd)
And a reminder of why your sister
walked away in the first place

delicate formality Blanc shakes her hand then

walks out into the night 146

Helen watches him go Then stares at Miles the same stare
she gave the invite in her sisters garage

A long beat

Then she drains the whiskey soda Holds the framed napkin
photo out at arms length And lets it fall

It shatters on the ground
Miles doesnt react

She takes a few steps towards him Weighs the crystal
tumbler in her hand

And SMASHES IT on the ground

Miles smirks

Helen picks up a slightly larger trinket and SMASHES it
Then a small vase Then a slightly larger piece of glass
sculpture

Miles laughs genuinely amused - what is she doing

Everyone else exchanges looks wondering the same thing

She smashes another thing then another eyes locked on
Miles

Its Whiskey who breaks the weird tension with

WHISKEY
You go girl

SMASH A slight smile breaks on Lionels face This feel
good to watch

LIONEL
Yeah Why the hell not

CLAIRE
Go Helen

SMASH The bar cart smashing bottles everywhere
A MASSIVE SMASH from offscreen draws everyones attention
BIRDIE has just smashed a large glass vase She gives a
PRIMAL SCREAM that stuns everyone

BIRDIE

Screw you Miles Goddamn that felt
good 146

Whiskey pushes something over gives Miles the finger

Lionel picks up something and with a grin at Miles BREAKS
it Claire too Peg DIVES IN with vigor

In all this Miles leans back a tight grin on his face his
arms raised in a gesture of fine have fun

MILES
Thats right guys get it out

After a round of this with smashed art and pottery and
bottles everywhere theres a natural lull Everyone laughs
like kids who just played in the mud

Miles claps grins

MILES (contd)
Ok Alright

But Helen does not stop or slow down She takes an ornate
war hammer and SMASHES the crystal suit of armor

LIONEL
Whoa - ok

Still laughing but a little uncomfortable Then she swings
it into a glass piano

LIONEL CLAIRE
Ok Helen - ha - Helen Helen Whoa -
alright

BIRDIE
I think that belonged to Liberace

A HUGE container of crystal marbles SMASH and they go
everywhere The mood in the room is turning as Helen shows
no sign of stopping but goes bigger and bigger

BIRDIE LIONEL
Helen ok - ok Helen Stop ok Thats plenty
thats good
CLAIRE WHISKEY
Whoa Whoa whoa whoa Holy shit
MILES

What do you want
Then Helen grabs Miless lighter from the table And IGNITES

the pile of alcohol-soaked rubble that was the bar cart It
goes up like a small pyre in the center of the room 146

EVERYONE
WHOA

They all panic as Helen starts grabbing anything flammable -
cushions pillows rugs throwing them on the growing fire

Everyone SLIPS and SLIDES on the crystal marbles trying to
catch her like a scene from a Buster Keaton movie

The SPRINKLERS come on but barely beat back the mini
bonfire

MILES
Ok STOP Stop Enough

She stops Walks over to him at the table water from the
sprinklers running down her face the fire behind her

MILES (contd)
Helen Walk away

She nods
HELEN
Yeah With a reminder of why my
sister walked away in the first
place

FLASHBACK - Blanc shaking her hand Handing her something
Giving her the subtlest of nods

Something she now straightens her posture and places on the
table in front of Miles

The marble sized crystal of Klear

Miles looks from it to the growing fire his eyes go wide
Flashing to The fireplace The lights The heating ducts
The appliances in the kitchen The coffee machine
Everything

As do Lionels

LIONEL
Oh sh-

The bonfire suddenly plumes upwards as if the air itself is
catching fire up into the ceiling into the vents into the
walls like the house itself is sucking the fire into its
lungs

One moment of horrible silence

EXT THE GLASS ONION - NIGHT 147

And the glass onion structure EXPLODES like a balloon with a
BURST of glass and fire

Then like the end of Caddyshack every Villa goes up
billows of fire debris all of it popping off like firework
champagne corks in the night Somewhere

SOOTHING ROBOT VOICE
This is a smokeless garden This is a
smokeless garden This

Pull back to reveal Blanc in a lawn chair He lights up
his CIGAR with great satisfaction Then passes the lighter
to Derol in a chair next to him awed at the destruction

BLANC
Disruption
DEROL
Fuckin A
INT ATRIUM - NIGHT 148

There isnt much structural damage but streams of fire jet
from ruptured walls the floor everywhere Everyone raises
their heads dazed

Miles looks around at his ruined kingdom After a perfect
comic beat the BABY BLUE PORSCHE falls from above and
SMASHES in a flaming heap in the middle of the atrium

Miles chokes back a sob Then locks eyes with Helen And he
realizes

She isnt done yet

She turns and runs and as she passes everyone they realize
in horror where he is going

They ALL run after her grabbing her all of them slipping

and yelling in slow motion trying to hold her back but shes
too strong she struggles forward reaching her hand out

To the over-ride button

For the Mona Lisa

Which is comfortable behind its fire-proof glass the flames
licking off its ambiguous gaze

148

Miles tries to hold her back screaming

Helen looks back at him reaches the button and without
hesitation PRESSES it

SHHHTICK

As the glass rises the painting is almost instantly
consumed in the inferno of fire

The entire group watches in slack jawed disbelief

Miles drops to his knees dumbstruck Looks in the

paintings eyes one last time before they burn away to ash

EXT THE GLASS ONION - MOMENTS LATER 149
Everyone stumbles out onto the steps choking and gasping

Miles looks around him tears in his eyes then turns on
Helen

MILES
Oh FANTASTIC You are so PUNK ROCK
You think you are an alligator You
think you popped me like a gangster
No You baby You child You feel
better now I hope your little bitch
tantrum gave you closure Cause that
accomplished NOTHING

HELEN
Your fuel of the future just
barbecued the worlds most famous
painting dumbass Congratulations on
the public launch of Klear and the
end of Miles Bron

This starts to sink in Miless face hollows out The glass
onion still burning behind him

HELEN (contd)
Youre ruined But you did get your
wish You will forever be remembered
in the same breath as the Mona Lisa

Helen wipes her hands on her pants and walks off past the
disruptors spread out on the steps past the flaming remains
of the entire compound

When shes gone the disruptors all look at him hatefully
Birdie raises her hand

149 149

BIRDIE
I saw the napkin he burned

Claire raises her hand
CLAIRE
God now you mention it I clearly
saw him grab Dukes gun
Then Lionel
LIONEL
I saw him driving away from Andis
house the night she was killed
They all look at him He stares back unbelieving
MILES
Oh you shit heads
150 EXT BEACH - NIGHT 150

And onto the beach Where Blanc sits staring out to sea at
the distant FERRY and several POLICE boats with flashing

sirens
BLANC
Did you get the son of a bitch
HELEN
Yup
BLANC

Ready to go home

Helen sits with straightened posture looking out at the
approaching boat Gazing out at it a long while Maybe
smiling maybe not its hard to tell
