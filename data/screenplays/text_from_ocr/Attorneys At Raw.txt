INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC -- MORNING

Camera follows the hurried attorney who lost his
briefcase through double glass doors past the reception
desk for Swedlow Jenkins and Assoc a large corporate
law firm

He scurries through the bullpen past the cubicles and
through two more glass doors into a large boardroom with
a conference table seemingly a mile long Gathered there

are the various older businessmen from earlier

all

chatting about stock prices and foolish democrats at a

low baritone hum drinking coffee and tea from

ornate

porcelain cups Seated at the table toward the back of
the room is a young attorney drinking a red bull
nervously checking his watch This is PAUL ABRIMOWITZ redheaded aggressive brilliant and at

all times

horny Two other young latently homosexual attorneys

LAWRENCE and PERRY approach him

PERRY
(re Abrimowitz)
Well well If it isn’t the
redheaded stepchild

LAWRENCE
Yes a rare and exotic species
indigenous to adult bookstores and
strip clubs

ABRIMOWITZ
Whatsup bitches How much ass are
you scheduled to lick today

PERRY
More like how much ass are we
scheduled to kick Abrimowitz

LAWRENCE
(high fiving Perry)
Nice one Perry Lick and Kick
that rhymes You and your life
partner Shapiro can use that in
one of your little raps Speaking
of where is that mo

ABRIMOWITZ
He’1ll probably be here any second
Lawrence I know he was meaning to
purchase an AK this morning come
in here and shoot everyone in the
balls starting with the two of
you

PERRY
Too bad my sack’s made of kevlar

ABRIMOWITZ
Well then I’1l be sure to
encourage him to aim higher like
at your dopey face

Perry gives Abrimowitz the finger He and Lawrence walk
away leaving Abrimowitz staring at the clock on the
wall

CUT TO
EXT MIDTOWN SUBWAY STATION -- MORNING
Shapiro hops up the stairs almost ramming into a few

people in the process

INT SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC BOARDROOM -- MORNING

DICK SWEDLOW swarthy cunning extremely white

and the managing partner at the firm enters the room
All the older men as well as PERRY and LAWRENCE turn to
greet him He is like a king holding court shaking
hands He is followed by TAWNY CUMMINGS petite
hotty Mr Swedlow’s secretary The men ogle SWEDLOW
leans over and whispers something naughty in her ear She
blushes and playfully slaps him At the end of the table
Abrimowitz looks on disgusted He pulls out a legal pad
and a pen and begins to doodle

EXT LAW OFFICE BUILDING -- EARLY MORNING

Shapiro runs toward the revolving doors stopping at the
homeless man out front He reaches into his briefcase
pulls out the M and M’s and hand them to the man Then
runs inside

INT LAW OFFICE BUILDING -- EARLY MORNING

Shapiro reaches the elevators and presses the button He
notices the strewn briefcase on the floor and grabs it
He checks his watch He knows he’s fucked He presses the
button harder as if that will make the elevator arrive
sooner

INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC BOARDROOM -- MORNING
The morning meeting has begun SWEDLOW holds court
SWEDLOW
Gentleman a beautiful morning
isn’t it
(MORE)

SWEDLOW (CONTD)
The dow is up the deficit is
down now if we could just get rid
of those damned Puerto Ricans
wed have ourselves a veritable
utopian society

Swedlow laughs heartily at his own joke the rest of the
room follows suit even RODRIGUEZ the Puerto Rican
attorney who laughs through gritted teeth

SWEDLOW (CONTD)
No offense meant Rodriguez We
had a wonderful weekend on the
course You’re a world class
caddy

RODRIGUEZ
None taken sir Thank you

SWEDLOW
(shifting focus)
Alright are we all in attendance
I’ve got a big announcement to
make

PERRY
Adam Shapiro still isn’t here sir

SWEDLOW
Oh that’s too bad Maybe Mr
Abrimowitz knows why his friend is
late this morning

All eyes shift to Abrimowitz

LAWRENCE
(smiling pricky)
Yes Paul pray tell

ABRIMOWITZ
Adam travels from Brooklyn
everydayYou know morning rush
hour There must have been one of
those sick passengers on his
train

SWEDLOW
I wouldn’t know I’ve had my
helicopter pick me up at my house
in the Hamptons and drop me off on
the roof of this building for the
past seven years Maybe Mr
Shapiro should look into renting a
helicopter himself

Swedlow laughs the room roars with laughter Abrimowitz
sweats bullets Just then Shapiro bursts through the
boardroom doors All eyes turn to him

SHAPIRO
(looks at watch)
According to my watch I’m early

Shapiro makes his way to the seat next to Abrimowitz
Swedlow checks his watch

SWEDLOW
What could possibly have held you
up

SHAPIRO
Honestly

SWEDLOW

No please lie to us

SHAPIRO
I overslept I was up way past my
beddy bye watching Bill O’Reilly
on Fox news I swear that guy has
got to be the greatest asshole
that ever lived

SWEDLOW
I too find myself intrigued by
his bassy voice and soulless lack
of compassion for any form of
human hardship It’s a personality
trait I aspire to

SHAPIRO
My point exactly Mr Swedlow

SWEDLOW
Well then you’re excused Now
onto the reason I called this
meeting The past six months have
been this firm’s most successful
period to date Our reputation as
ruthless corporate defenders has
spread like wildfire throughout
this great metropolis and I want
you all to stand and give
yourselves a rousing ovation for a
job well done

Everyone obliges clapping patting each other on the
back smiling Shapiro turns to Abrimowitz

SHAPIRO

(clapping)
This is retarded

ABRIMOWITZ
I know So where were you really

SHAPIRO
I copped those mixtapes you asked
for You owe me twenty

ABRIMOWITZ
Twenty I thought you were gonna
finagle a discount

SHAPIRO
I couldn’t I made his monkey
vomit But I did get free candy
which I gave to the foul smelling
bum out in front of the building

ABRIMOWITZ
Nice

The clapping subsides The attorneys take their seats
Swedlow continues

SWEDLOW
That felt good didn’t it And
gentleman our good fortune
continues to flourish Just last
night I secured our next high
profile case The kind of case
that should garner this firm some
serious press attention How many
of you are familiar with
“Wannabe”

LAWRENCE
The nightclub on 26th

PERRY
I once got so drunk there I
nearly shat my trousers

LAWRENCE
Uh those were my trousers
remember The blue cords I lent
you because you said that your
blue cords made you look fat

ABRIMOWITZ
My god that’s gay

SWEDLOW
I’m compelled to agree That is
extremely gay Anyway it seems
that just last week charges were
filed against the club Wannabe’s
owner Phillip Myazz alleging
that he knowingly allowed the
solicitation of illegal substances
on the premises As you can
imagine Mr Myazz is irate and
he wants us to fight to clear his
name

SHAPIRO
These charges were filed based on
what evidence

SWEDLOW
Some young hood rat OD’d on the
dance floor and three ounces of
cocaine were found on his body
Apparently he was a regular at
“Wannabe” and a couple of the
kid’s friends told the police that
Mr Myazz was a customer himself
All we’ve got to do is prove that
the kid’s friends and family
members are nothing but a bunch of
project born cracked out
crackheads looking for a buck and
this becomes an open and shut
case

Swedlow chuckles And of course so do all the other
attorneys Abrimowitz and Shapiro are less than amused

RODRIGUEZ
(laughing)
“Project born cracked out
crackheads” Hilarious sir

SWEDLOW
Thanks Roddy Now I can’t think
of any two guys more fit to defend
Mr Myazz

Perry grabs Lawrence’s hand

PERRY
Wed be honored sir
SWEDLOW
Than Mr Abrimowitz and Mr

Shapiro
( )

Disgusted

Perry lets go of Lawrence’s hand Abrimowitz

and Shapiro sit stunned

Abrimowitz

ABRIMOWITZ
Why us sir

LAWRENCE
Yeah why them

SWEDLOW

Their work on the Julian Park
Hotel case speaks for itself That
fat boy who fell and broke his hip
in the hotel’s spa seemed
unbeatable Until Mr Abrimowitz
discovered that his hip had been
bruised twice before at fat
camp

is not proud

SWEDLOW (CONTD)
-And Mr Shapiro upon cross
examination of the boy’s mother
got her to admit that she had put
sunscreen on the soles of the
engorged child’s feet earlier that
day while the two were sunning by
the pool I’ve been meaning to ask
you Adam how did you know that

SHAPTRO
Just a hunch

ABRIMOWITZ
He knew it because when I was a
kid I was overweight and my
mother would put lotion on my feet
to prevent callouses

SWEDLOW
Does that work

ABRIMOWITZ
I’ve got some smooth ass feet
sir

SWEDLOW

Lovely Mr Myazz will be here
today at noon to get to know his
representation I’ve told hima
lot about the two of you He too
likes the rap music I’m sure
youll all get along famously

ll

ABRIMOWITZ
(flat)
Cant wait

SHAPTRO
(flat)
Terrific

off their disenchanted looks we

CUT TO

INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC -- NOON

Abrimowitz and Shapiro stand by the cappucino machine
preparing cappucinos

SHAPIRO
You ever get the feeling that
youve worked for something all
your life only to become the
opposite of what you worked for

ABRIMOWITZ
Absolutely bro For instance
every time I watch a porno I
think “if only my dick was eleven
inches long” But then I look down
at it and it’s not

SHAPIRO
I remember when my dick stopped
growing Bad day

ABRIMOWITZ
After that life just doesn’t seem
worth living

SHAPTRO
You can say that again

Beat Their minds drift off and both men sip their
Cappucinos

INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC OFFICE -- NOON
Abrimowitz and Shapiro sit in their shared office with

Boys

They quickly remove their headphones She is ridiculously
hot

TAWNY (CONTD)

Tawny blushes
SHAPIRO
On the forehead of course A kiss
on the forehead

Abrimowitz shoots Shapiro a look

nearly wets himself

ABRIMOWITZ (CONTD)
Mmmmso soft so gentle

Tawny giggles

TAWNY

The guys watch her walk away Abrimowitz turns to
Shapiro

ABRIMOWITZ
What the fuck was that about

SHAPIRO

tasting Swedlow’s cock on your
lips Besides that’s sexual
harassment my man

ABRIMOWITZ
Bro you’re such a pussy

MYAZZ (0S)
Who’s such a pussy

The guys look up to see PHILLIP MYAZZ flaming former
club kid turned club owner with the world’s thickest
lisp standing at the door The two stand to greet him

ABRIMOWITZ

MYAZZ

SHAPIRO
(embarrassed)

MYAZZ

to each other when they’re alone

ABRIMOWITZ
I was calling my partner here a
pussy because he well just

because he is one sometimes

MYAZZ
Aren’t we all

Awkward beat

SHAPIRO
Well it’s a pleasure to meet you

MYAZZ

Yes it is a pleasure to meet me
isn’t it Swedlow has told me all
about the two of you How you both
grew up together and you rap with
each other I just think that is
so sweet

ABRIMOWITZ

Thanks We think it’s total
bullshit that you find yourself in
this mess

MYAZZ
I know Some kid decides to die
while doing the running man on my
dance floor and the cops want to
stick their gloved fists straight
up my ass I’m like at least
grease me first fellas right

Another awkward beat

ABRIMOWITZ
Right

MYAZZ
So I just wanted to come down
here show you my pretty face and
make sure my business is in good
hands

SHAPIRO
It is We assure you that we will
do everything in our power to get
you out of this dilemma

MYAZZ
I like that “Power” Dominance
The “panther”

Myazz hisses like a panther and just walks off
Abrimowitz and Shapiro look at eachother

SHAPIRO
Phil

ABRIMOWITZ
Myazz

CUT TO

EXT GREEK DINER -- EARLY AFTERNOON

Abrimowitz and Shapiro sit in a booth Abrimowitz pulls a
piece of wrinkled paper from his pocket

ABRIMOWITZ
Alright so I wrote this last
night I’m thinking we can use it
as an intro to a verse or as a
hook

SHAPIRO
Spit it

ABRIMOWITZ
Give me a beat

Shapiro begins beat-boxing

ABRIMOWITZ (CONTD)
“Tight as a pussy that’s been on
lock down pussy gets gushy when
I’m using my cock now my cock
gets stronger as it gets longer
long like the conga line I am the
war monger” So what do you
think

SHAPIRO
(sarcastic)
It’s nice and classy At least
it’s got that going for it

ABRIMOWITZ
I’m sorry it wasn’t more refined
and elegant Mr High Brow
Yknow not all our raps have to
be intellectualized

SHAPIRO
True But it isn’t vile to flip
up our style every twice ina
while go the extra mile find
ourselves in the top five
percentile y’know what I’m
saying

ABRIMOWITZ
Word Word to big bird

Shapiro pulls a wrinkled paper out of his pocket

SHAPIRO

ABRIMOWITZ

ourselves We just have to make
the right connections I’m still
waiting for Cohen to come through
with the beats so we can record a
demo

SHAPIRO
Keep waiting That bastard Cohen
ain’t never coming through we’ve
been waiting on that fool since we
were in grade school

ABRIMOWITZ
What can I say I have faith in
the guy

SHAPIRO

You just refuse to give up your
dreams of hip-hop stardom don’t
you

ABRIMOWITZ
Why should I settle into a life of
mediocrity when I know I have
talent enough to get me massive
quantities of vagina and cash

SHAPIRO

ABRIMOWITZ

SHAPIRO

Sara points to her father SPIRO a loud burly
moustached greek man screaming the word “tomato” on the
phone by the register

SARA
My father says he won’t be paying
for your bypass surgeries

ABRIMOWITZ
Well you can tell Spiro that as
long as he keeps deep frying his
fried chicken we’‘ll be here
chowing down

With that statement Abrimowitz takes a bite into a
chicken thigh Grease squirts from the thigh just
narrowly missing Abrimowitz’ face and hitting the seat
behind him The grease acts like acid and quickly melts
a smoking hole into the seat leather

SHAPTRO
(re grease)
Whoa

Unfazed Abrimowitz continues to chow down

ABRIMOWITZ
Mmmm So yummy

CUT TO

INT- SUBWAY CAR -- EARLY EVENING

finds his girlfriend JESSE stirring a steaming pot

selfish but irresistably sexy An amazing catch for
Shapiro

SHAPIRO (CONTD)

And then I came over here and read
a book called “The Prophet” that I
found on your bookshelf

SHAPTRO

JESSE
That whoever wrote it was way too

Wait I’m sorry Don’t go

JESSE
Too late mister I’m outta here
Be sure to say “hi” to your other
girlfriend Abrimowitz for me

SHAPTRO
Oh don’t call him that

Tears well up in Jesse’s eyes

JESSE
(emotional )
Well that’s what he is Except he
doesn’t put out or cook award
winning Eastern European dishes
for you

She exits

SHAPIRO
(calling after her)
JESSE

Shapiro hears the door of his apartment slam shut He
sits there silent looking sad Slowly the sad look on
his face morphs into a look of relief

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC OFFICE -- MORNING

Shapiro sits in his office quietly staring at photos of
an unidentified young black teenager His high school
graduation photo photos of him and his friends a photo
portrait with his mother and little sister all smiling
brightly The last photo shows the teenager dead laid
out on the dance floor of the nightclub Shapiro stares
long and hard at it Abrimowitz enters excitedly

ABRIMOWITZ
Yo You’re not going to believe
this

SHAPIRO
What

ABRIMOWITZ
What was it you said about Cohen
never coming through

SHAPIRO
That he never fuckin’ comes
through

ABRIMOWITZ
Right Well guess what I just
received a text from him He
scored us tickets to the Fiasco
show at Roseland tonight

Shapiro jumps up from his desk

SHAPTRO
Fiasco

ABRIMOWITZ
Fiasco motherfucker Only the
greatest living rapper on earth
You realize how rare an
opportunity this is

SHAPIRO
No shit Fiasco never performs
live When he does the cops
usually shut down the show halfway
through and charge him with
inciting a riot

ABRIMOWITZ
I know It’ll be extreme violence
And here’s the kicker
“Bizackstizage Pizasses”

SHAPIRO
What

ABRIMOWITZ
Backstage passes We got ‘em This
could be the greatest night of our
lives

SHAPIRO
Hell yeah I just gotta call my
girl and let her know I won’t be
seeing her tonight

ABRIMOWITZ
You mean you have to ask for
permission

SHAPIRO

NoWell yeswellkinda

ABRIMOWITZ
That’s fucking pathetic

Abrimowitz turns notices the photos

ABRIMOWITZ (CONTD)
(re teenager)
Hey who’s this

SHAPIRO
That’s James Mcelroy the victim
in the Myazz case We get to meet
his mother at noon

CUT TO

INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC DEPOSITION ROOM -- DAY

The deposition room is a small conference room Shapiro
and Abrimowitz sit facing LOUELLA MCELROY the
vitim’s mother She sobs as she clutches a picture of her

son

MS MCELROY
---and so you see my son James
was trying to put food on the
table for us He had just turned
eighteen in April On his
birthday I bought him an ice
cream cake His favorite mint
chocolate chip He made a wish
then blew out his candles He
turned to me and told me what he
had wished for James wished that
someday he could make enough
money to send his little sister
Shante to a good private school
I told him to hush That if he
told anyone his dreams they might
never come true

Louella is
Abrimowitz

overwhelmed with grief and can’t continue
and Shapiro look at each other mortified

ABRIMOWITZ
Ms Mcelroy I know it must have
been difficult for you raising
James and Shante all on your own
May I ask where is their father

MS MCELROY
Sam died four years ago of
emphysema After that James felt
like he had to become the man of
the house

Ms Mcelroy weeps harder Shapiro hands her a tissue

SHAPIRO
Will you excuse us for one moment

INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC -- A MOMENT LATER

Abrimowitz and Shapiro step outside the deposition room
and close the door

Beat

SHAPIRO
I feel sick
ABRIMOWITZ
No doubt This is some heavy shit
SHAPIRO
I’m not sure we’re doing the right
thing
ABRIMOWITZ

God I wish my mother was black

SHAPIRO
What do you mean

ABRIMOWITZ
They’re friggin’ saints Why do
you think black guys are always
getting so upset when someone says
something about their momma

SHAPIRO
True You could say anything about
my mother and I wouldn’t take
offense I might even agree with
you

ABRIMOWITZ
You could call my mother a fat
ugly mean ass bitch or a ho or
something and I’m right there with
ya But not if my mother was
black Shapiro man I don’t feel
so good about this one

SHAPIRO
Let’s go talk to Swedlow

CUT TO

INT- SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC SWEDLOW’S OFFICE --DAY

An incredibly gaudy ornate office with an amazing view
of the manhattan skyline Swedlow sits behind his large
mahogany desk as Abrimowitz and Shapiro stand across
from him pleading their case

ABRIMOWITZ
Her son was just trying to survive
on the street He wasn’t even old
enough to be in the club that
night Myazz isn’t even being held
accountable for that

SWEDLOW
(angry)
Whose side are you on gentlemen

SHAPIRO
With all due respect sir we feel
like your judgement in choosing to
have this firm defend Mr Myazz in
this case is questionable

SWEDLOW
What makes you say that

SHAPIRO
Look I know it seems frivolous
but as fans of hip-hop weve
heard countless lyrical tales of
Urban decay

(MORE )

SHAPIRO (CONTD)

Of how young black teenagers like

Mr Mcelroy are forced into lives

of crime because of poor education

systems and little to no job

opportunity

Abrimowitz starts rapping

ABRIMOWITZ
“Shorty’s runnin’ wild Smokin’
ses drinkin’ beer and ain’t
tryin’ to hear what I’m kickin’
in his ear

SHAPIRO
“Neglected for now but yo it’s
got to be accepted that what

ABRIMOWITZ
“That life is hectic”

Pause They wait for a response from Swedlow who sits
stonefaced

SWEDLOW
Why didn’t Mr Mcelroy start
rapping Seems he would have made
a lot of money off of white boys
who love hip-hop like you two
idiots

SHAPTRO
Excuse me sir but

SWEDLOW
You’re wasting my time gentlemen

ABRIMOWITZ
Mr Swedlow the trial is a couple
of months away but we do believe
that the boy’s mother will prove
to be a strong witness for the
prosecution She nearly had us
both in tears

SWEDLOW

We’‘ll keep her from taking the
stand by promising her and her
daughter an all expenses paid
vacation to Key West or some such
I wouldn’t worry about it And
neither should you two Grow some
balls will ya

Abrimowitz and Shapiro are silenced

SWEDLOW (CONTD)
Now if you’1ll excuse me

They turn and exit A beat then Tawny climbs out from
under Mr Swedlow’s desk

SWEDLOW (CONTD)
Did you like that baby

TAWNY
(fawning)
You’re so brilliant And your dick
stayed hard through all of it

Swedlow smiles and pushes her back under his desk

CUT TO

EXT LAW OFFICE BUILDING -- EARLY EVENING

Abrimowitz and Shapiro walk out of work together Shapiro
is pissed

SHAPTRO
If that’s what it’s gonna take for
us to make it as attorneys in this
town becoming ruthless self
involved obnoxious heartless
white assholes like Swedlow then
fuck it

ABRIMOWITZ
I hate to tell you Adam but
you’re already white

SHAPIRO
No I’m not I’m a Jew

ABRIMOWITZ
Look calm down alright All
that’s required of us here is to
deliver quality opening and
closing statements and the rest
of the trial will take care of
itself If we win we get
promoted and use the extra dough
to pay for beats and record a
demo If we lose we still come
out looking alright and we press
on to the next case We just gotta
keep our heads down and work hard
right now What is it that Method
Man said on the Biggie album

Abrimowitz pats Shapiro on the back and heads off

SHAPIRO
“Fuck the world don’t ask me for
shit everything you get you
gotta work hard for it” Maybe
youre right but I just never
thought I’d turn into one of those
sharks y’know The kind that
drains the blood of the innocent
and disadvantaged for their own
personal benefit I mean we’re
taking about a dead eighteen year
old here man

ABRIMOWITZ
I’m with you but you wanna know
how I deal with that anxiety

SHAPIRO
How

ABRIMOWITZ
I whack one out Or maybe two In
your case you should go back to
your place call your girl tell
her to drag her ass across the
street then fuck her in that
ass Don’t forget to ask her for
permission to go to the show
tonight and you’re set

SHAPIRO
(sarcastic)

put it that way that

ABRIMOWITZ
(calling back)

SHAPIRO

Shapiro notices Cohen’s new shiny mouth

SHAPIRO
Nice teeth That a new piece

COHEN
You like them shits right I had
no better idea of what to do with

ABRIMOWITZ

Cohen motions for them all to head inside

COHEN
Shall we gentleman

ABRIMOWITZ
Let’s lose our fuckin’ minds

SHAPIRO
Yeah boy

INT ROSELAND -- NIGHT

They enter as Fiasco’s hype man MIRACLE is warming up the
crowd in typical hip-hop concert fashion Abrimowitz
Shapiro and Cohen grab beers at the bar FIASCO hits
the stage He is larger than life and he comes out
blazing His presence on stage is electric and powerful
The crowd goes berserk Abrimowitz and Shapiro rap along
with their favorite rapper They know every word They
are in their element Cohen dances in the middle of the
floor A circle forms around him people cheering him on
His dancing is wild and frenetic The crowd watches him
amused Abrimowitz and Shapiro can only laugh and shake
their heads

INT ROSELAND BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT

Backstage the atmosphere is smoky Abrimowitz Shapiro
and Cohen stand in a long line of white kids waiting to
meet Fiasco and Miracle who are at the end of the
hallway signing autographs

SHAPIRO
(re line)
This is gonna take forever

ABRIMOWITZ

Cohen heads off

ABRIMOWITZ
Peace Co-Co

Shapiro notices something

SHAPIRO
Hey check it out

Fiasco has stopped signing autographs and seems to be in
an argument with his manager He gets loud

FIASCO
(angry)
This is what I’ve been talking
about You ain’t marketing Fiasco
to the urban demographic All I
see on this line are a bunch of
small pimply white kids

MANAGER
Fiasco I’ve told you marketing
in the hood is unprofitable

FIASCO

And I told you I don’t give a
shit I’m getting the fuck outta
here Where my hoes at

A long line of big booty hoes file out of Fiasco’s
dressing room and follow Fiasco Miracle and the rest
of Fiasco’s entourage out the back door Back to
Abrimowitz and Shapiro

SHAPIRO
Shit So much for getting
backstage and signing a record
deal huh

Shapiro waits for a response from Abrimowitz who stares
entranced at all the beautiful black booty

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
Paul

ABRIMOWITZ
(salivating)
Damn look at those onions It’s
enough to make a grown man cry

SHAPTRO
C’mon let’s bounce

ABRIMOWITZ

The two head off

FADE TO

EXT LAW OFFICE BUILDING -- MORNING

Establishing shot

INT SWEDLOW JENKINS AND ASSOC -- MORNING
Abrimowitz and Shapiro prepare cappucinos

ABRIMOWITZ
-But you gotta admit he was on
fire He broke into the hook on
“Heavenly Death” and I thought my
fucking head was gonna fall off

SHAPIRO
He was incredible I hate these
wack ass radio stations that don’t
play his shit just because he’s
never gone mainstream The man’s a
living legend a giant

ABRIMOWITZ
Nowadays you gotta talk about how
much ass you get how many people
you’ve murdered and how big your
bank account is to get any play
Even after that you still have to
suck on the DJ’s shaft Speaking
of sucking on shaft how’s your
girlfriend

SHAPIRO
I called her last night when I got
home but she didn’t answer her
phone I think she’s still pissed

ABRIMOWITZ
You know a good man will spend
years with a bitch just to avoid
breaking up with her breaking her
heart In the meantime that man
will sacrifice an abundance of
good pussy and a life of freedom
just so he can call himself a
“good” man

SHAPIRO

What are you gettin’ at
ABRIMOWITZ

Get real and dump that skank

already

Suddenly COHEN comes running through the office towards
them He is sweaty and still wearing the clothes he wore
last night

COHEN
(screaming)
Soldiers

Abrimowitz and Shapiro see him They look around at the
other attorneys embarrassed Lawrence and Perry look on

PERRY
(re Cohen)
Oh my god there’s a third

LAWRENCE
And this one looks like a
mongoloid

Cohen reaches Abrimowitz and Shapiro out of breath

SHAPIRO
What are you doing here Cohen

ABRIMOWITZ
Yeah what the fuck man

COHEN
I pulled a rabbit out my hat

ABRIMOWITZ
What do you mean

COHEN
So last night after you pussies
jetted I found myself sitting
alone at the cheese table
thinking about my grandpa When
outta nowhere guess who steps up

SHAPIRO
Who

COHEN
Miracle himself

ABRIMOWITZ
Wait we saw Miracle leave out the
back door with Fiasco

COHEN
Right but Miracle came back
because he didn’t want to let
Fiasco’s fans down

(MORE)

COHEN (CONTD)
He said that Fiasco’s just a
hothead sometimes Then he and I
bonded over a bottle of Hennessy
a blunt and Gruyere cheese Your
man’s is sophisticated like that

SHAPTRO
What does this have to do with us

COHEN
So me and him got to shootin’ the
shit right And I happened to
mention to him that I have these
two crazy ass friends that write
crazy ass raps and got the crazy
ass rhymin’ skills to back it up
I told him that with some tracks
and a record deal you two could
earn Fiasco’s label some serious
cash Daddy Warbucks style y’know
what I’m sayin’ He gave me the
address some spot down in the
meat packing district He told me
to make sure you guys were there
at no earlier than one in the
morning

A beat Abrimowitz and Shapiro process this

SHAPIRO
(not buying it)
Get the fuck outta here

ABRIMOWITZ
You shittin’ us

COHEN
I knew you two Bambaclots wouldnt
believe me so I wrote the address
on my right arm

Cohen holds out his right arm and an address is written
there in bold lettering

ABRIMOWITZ
(realizing)
Wait aren’t you right handed

COHEN
Exactly
SHAPIRO
(loud)
Holy shit

The whole office turns to see what’s going on Abrimowitz
grabs a piece of paper and copies the address off of
Cohen’s arm

ABRIMOWITZ
That’s fucking unbelievable

SHAPTRO
This is it

COHEN
Unfortunately I can’t be at the
audition ‘cause I’m workin’ mop
duty at the peep show tonight But
as your manager I encourage you
to form a cipher and get the shit

down tight
SHAPTRO
You mean rehearse
COHEN
Yeah right rehearse
ABRIMOWITZ
Absolutely We will Thanks
Cohen
SHAPTRO

Much love and respect

COHEN
Never mind all that Just don’t
forget me when you buy your first
Bentleys Peace in the middle
east bitches

And like a vision Cohen slowly walks away Abrimowitz
and Shapiro turn to one another with looks of amazement

Abrimowitz grabs Shapiro’s seltzer water and tips it
over spilling some onto the floor

ABRIMOWITZ

Let’s pour out a little club soda
for those that didn’t make it

Spiro sees this and becomes enraged
SPIRO
(screaming)
Malaka Skata Busti Flaka
Spiro huffs off into the kitchen

ABRIMOWITZ
What do you think he just said

SHAPIRO

Must be Greek for “you guys are
awesome”

Shapiro reaches into his briefcase and pulls put a photo

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
Remember this

It is a photo of a very young Abrimowitz and Shapiro
standing in front of Hebrew school dressed in matching
Adidas jumpsuits Kangol hats and thick rimmed
sunglasses

ABRIMOWITZ
Oh shit Back in the day

Camera pushes in on the photo and it comes to life

DISSOLVE TO

EXT HEBREW SCHOOL FLASHBACK -- DAY

We are back in 1986 and the two nine year olds begin
rapping in front of the Yeshiva

shake of his staff

YOUNG SHAPIRO
Noah built the ark to escape
god’s wrath

YOUNG ABRIMOWITZ
Queen Esther was the dopest chick
ever

YOUNG SHAPIRO
Too bad she wound up with
Nebuchadnezzar

They continue their Hebrew School rap Eventually they
attract a small group of nine year old African American
kids The two look at each other nervous but continue
to rap until they each get punched in the mouth They hit
the ground and the young African American posse beats
their asses

DISSOLVE TO

INT- GREEK DINER -- MOMENTS LATER

Present day The two look at each other and start
laughing

ABRIMOWITZ

Abrimowitz and Shapiro on Abrimowitz’ moped pull up in
front of a warehouse in the meat packing district of

Shapiro riding in back checks the address on the paper

SHAPIRO

You sure this is the place

ABRIMOWITZ
This is one twenty seven west
eleventh street right

SHAPIRO
Yeah but I thought there would be
some signage

ABRIMOWITZ
Guess not No worries It’s
probably decked out inside

They slowly dismount the moped and head towards the
entrance

ABRIMOWITZ (CONTD)
What time is it

SHAPIRO
(checks watch)
Twelve fifty eight

ABRIMOWITZ
Great We have a couple minutes

Abrimowitz reaches into his jacket pocket

SHAPIRO

I want to get high

SHAPIRO
Wait don’t you think that will
effect your performance

ABRIMOWITZ
For the better maybe Want a
puff

SHAPIRO

Shapiro watches as Abrimowitz puffs away enjoying
himself Then

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
You know what Let me have a hit

ABRIMOWITZ

Abrimowitz hands Shapiro the rest of the roach Shapiro
takes a huge hit and lets out a billowing cloud of
smoke He begins coughing violently

Miracle walks further into the warehouse closely
followed by Abrimowitz and Shapiro Miracle snaps his
fingers and two more blinding lights switch on
illuminating two shiny microphones lying on the floor
their cords leading to more shadow They stop in front of
the mics

MIRACLE (CONTD)

Abrimowitz and Shapiro bend over and pick up the
microphones encountering heavy ear piercing feedback

ABRIMOWITZ

Abrimowitz and Shapiro look at each other They begin
rapping timidly

SHAPIRO
Ski down a slippery slope with
the Mann’s chinese

ABRIMOWITZ
They rocked bunny hop rope dodged
flags with ease

SHAPIRO
Breezed through creases on the
thinnest sheets of ice without

ABRIMOWITZ
-the slicing of the snowmat had
us exclaiming

ABRIMOWITZ and SHAPIRO

They continue rapping getting more aggressive with every
rhyme They get lost in the moment and go for it pouring
their heart and soul into it It is soon apparent that
their raps are special They break into a hook

ABRIMOWITZ and SHAPIRO (CONTD)

some of it is profound but one thing is clear they’re
having fun Fiasco watches closely Shapiro goes for it

SHAPIRO
Fight the battle with vigor in
the streets I’m the killer hip-

Abrimowitz turns to Shapiro stunned Shapiro just keeps
going The posse turns to one another Fiasco looks
angry Did Shapiro just say the “N” word Abrimowitz
tries to stop Shapiro but he just keeps going The posse
rushes them One of them grabs Shapiro by the neck and
his eyes bulge out

perfect little lawyer kissing
Swedlow’s ass

Now it’s getting personal

ABRIMOWITZ

Yesterday the childrens
charity “Here Is Hope Have Some
a nationwide foundation dedicated
to helping disabled children live
a normal life received an
overwhelming donation from local
New York City club owner and
entrepreneur Phillip Myazz The
donation said to exceed two
million dollars will go directly
to the charitys research
facilities As of late Myazz has
found himself mired in a criminal
lawsuit alleging he knowingly
allowed the solicitation of
illegal drugs inside his popular
hot spot “Wannabe” Skeptics
believe that this latest move is
meant to clean up his tarnished
image We caught up with the
estranged club owner to get his
reaction to those rumors

Shapiro turns up the volume Cue Myazz

MYAZZ

(on tv)
I was born with spinal meningitis
so I know exactly what a lot of
these little babies are going
through And look at me I grew up
to be wealthy sexy and
powerfullike a Panther

Myazz does his signature Panther hiss Disgusted Shapiro
mutes the tv Jesse enters and stands in the kitchen
doorway No one should look this good this early in the
morning Shapiro looks up

SHAPIRO

getting ready for work

She goes in for the kiss He moves his head and she ends
up kissing his neck He looks past her to the tv And
sees Matt Lauer with a picture of Fiasco behind him He
struggles to get her off of him

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
Hold on a second Jess

She looks back to see what he is looking at and

It’s Cohen Shapiro waves him in He enters wearing all
black complete with dark shades holding a forty ounce
of malt liquor He pours a drop on the carpet

COHEN

See you at the crossroads Fiasco

Shapiro gets upset

SHAPIRO

ABRIMOWITZ
Shut the hell up Adam For the
fifteenth time that wasn’t my
mustard

SHAPIRO
So what The mustard just walked
in here all by itself and laid
itself all over the carpet

The two former buddies start arguing back and forth
Cohen can’t take it anymore

COHEN
Both of you need to chill

They look up at him

COHEN (CONTD)
How dare you argue about mustard
on a day like this Do you realize
that the king of the underground
got shot and killed last night
And you two his two biggest fans
are still beefin’ In times of
mourning and sorrow people should
put aside their differences and
come together in respect to the
memory of the fallen

A beat Abrimowitz and Shapiro are speechless Then

ABRIMOWITZ
That was beautiful Cohen

COHEN
I know Now if you’1ll excuse a
motherfucker I gotta go drink
myself into oblivion

He heads for the door They watch him go He stops
remembering something

COHEN (CONTD)
Oh yeah the real reason I came
down here was to tell you that
Fiasco’s label announced that
they’re puttin’ out an album of
all Fiasco’s unreleased material

Cohen exits They sit for a beat Then

SHAPIRO
(reading)
It’s called “Heavenly Death”

The cd cover has a drawn picture of Fiasco with a halo
over his head and wings like an angel They stare at it
for a moment when suddenly they hear a commotion coming
from behind them The commotion is the sound of DOO DOO
BROWN entering the store He is diminutive in stature
wearing lots of bling and a fur coat He has a gorgeous
model on each arm His posse trails behind him They
rough up a few store employees He makes his way up the
steps to the signing table

DOO DOO

The original gangsta pimp is here

His fans go wild He continues to spew lewd obscenities
at his fans who devour every word Abrimowitz and Shapiro
look on disgusted They head to the register where

ABRIMOWITZ
Who are you his little bitch
SHAPTRO
Abrimowitz
MARTIN

I feel like taking a shower

SHAPIRO
How are we ever going to prove to
anyone that we wrote those lyrics

ABRIMOWITZ

We’re not going to We can’t
Because Fiasco is dead

This realization sits heavy with them Shapiro buries his
head in his hands Abrimowitz angrily throws a cup of
coffee across the room

SHAPIRO

Just then Louella Mcelroy enters sobbing and
screaming A man from The Nation of Islam stands behind

Rapping is for low lives You are

SHAPIRO
(weakly )
Yes it is

JESSE

No it’s not You are an attorney
and a damned good one If you just
get your head out of your ass and
start concentrating on making some
serious money in a respectable
honorable fashion then maybe you
might be able to provide me with
the life I truly deserve If you
can’t do that tell me now so I
can go out and find a better man
that can

This is Shapiro’s chance to get away and he knows it He

But they were stolen from us
ABRIMOWITZ
All the more reason to write new
ones
SHAPIRO

ABRIMOWITZ

No shut up You’re a fuckin’
pussy What happened to the kid I
knew that shit his pants while
rounding second base playing
softball at camp and still had
the balls to get to home and score
the game winning run Or the kid
who encouraged me to ask out Lisa
Applebaum because I liked her
even though she had braces and
boogers were always hanging out of
her nose Or the guy that wrote
raps like “To infinity and
beyond Shapiro’s the greatest
word is bond”

Shapiro starts misting up

ABRIMOWITZ (CONTD)
That guy was the coolest
motherfucker I’ve ever met
Invincible Indestructible What
happened to him

Shapiro starts full on crying

SHAPIRO
He became a pussy

Abrimowitz feels for his friend and puts an arm around
him for comfort

ABRIMOWITZ

muddy swampy stinky pussy But
it’s not too late You’re just
stressed out that’s all Why
don’t you go home and take the
rest of the day off Tomorrows

Would you like that

Shapiro blows his nose in his sleeve and gets up to go

Shapiro is smiling and clapping Abrimowitz observes

ABRIMOWITZ
Glad to see you’re no longer
feeling shitty

SHAPIRO
I must admit there’s nothing like
a hot summer day in the park
eating popsicles playing b-ball
to make me feel like I’m not such
a douche

ABRIMOWITZ
Well I wouldn’t go that far
You’re still a little douchey

Shapiro laughs appreciates his friend’s honesty

SHAPIRO
Y’know you really are like my
other girlfriend

ABRIMOWITZ
Where did that come from

SHAPIRO
That’s what Jesse says about you
all the time

A beat Abrimowitz doesn’t quite know how to respond

ABRIMOWITZ
Fuck Jesse

SHAPIRO

Abrimowitz laughs and so does Shapiro They hear a bunch

of the players on the court cat calling They look up and
notice the group of fly ghetto princesses being harassed
One of the girls looks familiar

ABRIMOWITZ
Wait a second Don’t we know that
girl

SHAPTRO

Just then Shondra looks up and notices Abrimowitz and
Shapiro pointing and staring at her They notice that she
notices and look away but it’s too late She says
goodbye to her friends and heads into her car

SHAPIRO
Where do you think she’s going

SHAPTRO
I don’t know about this

ABRIMOWITZ

Shapiro considers for a beat then reluctantly hops on

SHAPIRO
Just don’t kill us I don’t want

FIASCO
---So you followed my little
sister all the way from Manhattan
just to ask her if she knew why I
stole your rhymes Is that
correct

SHAPIRO
That’s correct Fiasco That’s all
we wanted from her An
explanation nothing else

ABRIMOWITZ
We never expected it to go this
far

FIASCO

Never expected to see me alive
huh

SHAPIRO
Never But we’re glad you’re not
dead
FIASCO

You two nosy motherfuckers have
seen too much

Abrimowitz and Shapiro look at each other

ABRIMOWITZ
What does that mean

FIASCO
Means you leave me no choice but
to dispose of your meddling asses

With that Fiasco pulls a gun out of his back pocket
cocks it and points it at Abrimowitz and Shapiro

SHAPIRO
No Mommy
ABRIMOWITZ
Wait Why did you do it
FIASCO
Do what
ABRIMOWITZ

Fake your own death

FIASCO
None of your goddamned business

He’s about to pull the trigger

SHAPIRO
Hold up At least tell us why you
stole our shit

A tense beat Then

FIASCO
Just like you said in your hook
your shit was hot F-Squad was
feeling your shit So I decided
to capitalize

SHAPIRO
That’s fucked up

ABRIMOWITZ
We wrote those rhymes when we were
kids We’ve been writing rhymes
ever since Rapping is the only
thing that ever truly meant
anything to us

FIASCO
Too bad so sad You see at some
point in every life everyone has
to play that role The role of the
victim

SHAPIRO
But you were our hero We
worshipped you How much of it was
real

ABRIMOWITZ
Yeah have you ever done this
before Stolen anyone else’s
rhymes

FIASCO
Hell no NeverIt’s just that
lately the god felt like he was
losing his touch y’know

SHAPIRO
(confused)
Losing your touch

ABRIMOWITZ
Are you kidding We thought your
last album “Token Schemes For
Broken Dreams” was your hottest to
date

FIASCO
You did

SHAPIRO
It was straight up revolutionary

FIASCO
Yeah well tell that to the little
punk that was trying to kill me

The whole room looks to Fiasco Fiasco looks to the
floor A tense beat then

SHONDRA
What are you talking about
Clifford

ABRIMOWITZ and SHAPIRO

Clifford
FIASCO
Nothing for you to worry about
Shondra
SHONDRA
(tough)

Fuck that I want to know

FIASCO

by shooting being organized by
that little nigga Doo Doo Brown

ABRIMOWITZ and SHAPIRO

Shondra turns to Miracle

SHONDRA
(to Miracle)
Why didn’t you tell me

MIRACLE
(ashamed)
I’m sorry Shondra

She turns back to Fiasco Abrimowitz and Shapiro witness
the drama unfold

SHONDRA
I thought you did this because you
were sick of the spotlight

FIASCO
I told you that because I didn’t
want you to worry All I’ve ever
loved is hip-hop The fame the
cash the hoes I saw myself doing
it for the rest of my life But I
guess it wasn’t meant to be

This sad moment hangs for a beat Then Abrimowitz and
Shapiro look at each other They are thinking the same
thing

SHAPIRO

Fiasco we think we might be able
to help you

FIASCO
Oh yeah How

ABRIMOWITZ
Shapiro and I are Lawyers Thats
our day job and how we pay the
bills We write rhymes on the
side Now if what you say is
true that Doo Doo Brown was
actively involved in a conspiracy
to have you murdered then we can
use whatever evidence you have to
prosecute him

MIRACLE
We have no evidence Just the word
on the street

SHAPIRO
Well look we hate Doo Doo Brown
He represents everything that’s
wrong with hip hop

FIASCO
Word

SHAPIRO
If you just give us a chance we
can investigate and maybe find a
way to entrap him in some other
crime Have his sorry ass
arrested

ABRIMOWITZ
Right We might even be able to
get him to confess to his plot to
have you assassinated

Fiasco considers

FIASCO
Are you two that good at what you
do

SHAPIRO

We’re the best

ABRIMOWITZ
No doubt

Fiasco considers further Miracle steps up

MIRACLE
Might not be a bad idea god

Fiasco looks at Abrimowitz and Shapiro He uncocks his
gun

FIASCO
You got one week

ABRIMOWITZ
That’s not enough time

FIASCO
Well that’s all you get If you
can’t have Doo Doo arrested by the
end of the week F-Squad’s gonna
hunt your asses down and you’1l
end up deader than I am
Understand

ABRIMOWITZ
Yes sir

SHAPTRO
Word is bond

FIASCO
(to F-Squad)
Now Get these motherfuckers outta

Fiasco walks off into the bathroom Two members of F-

INT SHONDRA’S CAR -- DAY

Shondra drives Abrimowitz rides shotgun Shapiro sits in

back

SHAPIRO
The toughest part is that there’s
no real evidence

ABRIMOWITZ
True But setting him up shouldnt
be too hard You saw what a
wanksta he acted like at his album
signing

SHONDRA
That motherfucker got it comin’ to
him too He’s a bitch’s bitch if
you know what I’m saying

ABRIMOWITZ
Sounds like you and he had a run
in

SHONDRA
Can I trust you guys to keep a
secret

SHAPIRO
Sure

SHONDRA
One night about a year ago Doo
Doo and I got to dancin’ ata
house party in the Bronx I was

real drunk so I let the little
bastard grind all up on me He was
nasty You ever get close to a
motherfucker whose breath smells
like a rat must have crawled up
his ass and died

SHAPIRO
Never Not me

Abrimowitz just laughs

SHONDRA
Well anyway since that night
that little troll’s been trying to
knock boots with me When I turned
him down he retaliated by dissin’
my big brother on his first album
That set off a beef on wax and I
guess Doo Doo was trying to take
it to the next level by murdering
him

ABRIMOWITZ
Ain’t that a bitch

SHONDRA
To top it off I heard he don’t
give no money to his family His
momma’s still collecting food
stamps and eating welfare cheese

As Shondra continues talking about Doo Doo’s family
Shapiro begins to recall the conversation he had with the
three rap kids on the train It plays back in his mind

QUICK FLASHBACK

RAP KID 1
“My second cousin twice removed
is none other than the infamous
Doo Doo Brown”

BACK TO PRESENT Shapiro gets struck with an idea He
looks out the car window and sees a subway station

SHAPIRO
Stop the car

ABRIMOWITZ
What

SHAPIRO

Pull over Shondra

SHONDRA
I know you ain’t getting ready to
throw up in my car

She pulls over Shapiro frantically jumps out of the car
and heads directly into the subway station

SHONDRA (CONTD)
Where’s he going

ABRIMOWITZ
I don’t know He must have a plan

Now alone the two sit in silence An awkward beat
Abrimowitz checks his watch

ABRIMOWITZ (CONTD)
(sweet)
It’s still early Would you want
to grab some lunch with me
Shondra thinks about this for a moment then smiles

SHONDRA

ABRIMOWITZ
Nice neighborhood you brought us
to Filled with happy prosperous
people

SHONDRA

(re kids)
Whose kids are these

SHAPIRO
These kids are Doo Doo Brown’s
cousins And they’re going to help
us get him arrested

Shapiro points across the street to a six story tenement
on the corner with a bodega on its ground floor

Abrimowitz

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
See that building

and Shondra nod

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
That’s where Doo Doo’s baby momma
lives and where he’s been
spending most of his time
recently Every morning around
this time he goes for a leisurely
jog through this infested
neighborhood My plan is as
follows We position the kids on
the corner and have them wait for
him to come outside of the
building When Doo Doo appears
they’1l ask him to go inside the
bodega and purchase a forty ounce
for them All the while we’ll be
safely perched here and when Doo
Doo exits the store and hands his
cousins the forty we’ll snap a
few pictures with my disposable
camera All that’s left is to leak
the pictures of Doo Doo supplying
minors with liquor to the police
and the press and it’s twenty
five to life So what do you
think

A beat Abrimowitz and Shondra stare at him Then

ABRIMOWITZ
Congratulations That’s the

Doo Doo heads into the bodega with his posse The kids
turn and give Shapiro the “thumbs up”

A few moments later Doo Doo and his posse exit the
store forty ounce in hand He hands it over to Rap Kid
1 Across the street Shapiro readies his camera

DOO DOO

nothing

As Rap Kid 1 takes the bottle Shapiro attempts to snap
a photo But it doesn’t snap Shapiro looks down at the
camera

SHAPIRO

Abrimowitz grabs the camera out of his hand

ABRIMOWITZ

father’s about to

Abrimowitz notices Spiro at the grill staring blankly

grew up here And now he’s
desperately trying to sell this
place to the Myazz corporation

ABRIMOWITZ

SARA
None other He wants to convert it
into a macrobiotic restaurant If
we could just get some good
publicity my father wouldn’t have
to give up what he’s worked so
hard for all his life

moped Abrimowitz hops off like the mack and graciously
offers his arm to Shondra She takes it and they approach

Abrimowitz and Shapiro turn to eachother

SHAPIRO

SHAPIRO
Impressive

ABRIMOWITZ

grabs her arm

Doo Doo’s show is now in full swing On stage he mocks
cunnilingus with a scantily clad female dancer It’s
nasty Abrimowitz Shapiro and Shondra watch from the
back of the club

SHONDRA
This makes me sick

ABRIMOWITZ
I can’t wait till it’s over

SHAPIRO
All that matters now is that we
find a way to entrap him

SHONDRA
Listen Shapiro I’m sorry about
what I said about the size of your
dick earlier I just got so mad

SHAPIRO
No hard feelings To be honest
it’s nothing special It’s a nice
average size It’s just right
Certainly bigger than a tic-tac

Suddenly Phil Myazz walks up behind them and put his
arms around Abrimowitz and Shapiro

MYAZZ
My boys
They turn to face him
ABRIMOWITZ
Mr Myazz
MYAZZ

Myazz reacts

MYAZZ

ABRIMOWITZ

SHAPTRO

Myazz leads them to a door and opens it Myazz heads
inside the crowded private room Abrimowitz and Shapiro
stand in the doorway and take in the scene It’s like
Sodom and Gomorrah Members of Doo Doo’s posse chase
naked women with dead fish One thug gets head in the
corner Naked bodies are scattered amongst smoke and
sounds of revelry Myazz takes a seat next to Doo Doo on
a large sofa at the back of the room In front of them is
an enormous mound of cocaine piled high on a glass table
Abrimowitz and Shapiro have never seen anything like this
before Myazz calls out to them

MYAZZ
Get your asses over here

They slowly head over to where Myazz and Doo Doo are
seated

MYAZZ (CONTD)
Doo Doo these are the delicious
young attorneys I was telling you

Doo Doo bleary eyed and high looks up at them

Shapiro)

Doo Doo grabs a crack pipe off the table stuffs it with
some coke and offers it to Abrimowitz and Shapiro

DOO DOO

SHAPTRO

ABRIMOWITZ

We’re trying to cut down

Doo Doo shrugs lights the pipe and takes the hit for
himself Myazz simultaneously leans over and does a line
of coke off the table Shapiro reaches into his pocket
and presses “record” on the mini tape recorder

MYAZZ
Doo Doo what do you say we stay

Abrimowitz hands Shapiro the camera phone Shapiro lines
up his shot to catch Doo Doo obliviously smoking crack in
the bg It’s a perfect shot

SHAPIRO

Shapiro snaps the photo when suddenly one of Doo Doo’s
posse members steps up behind him and puts a gun to his
head

THUG

The thug cocks the gun and the whole room stops Shapiro
is frozen in terror

MYAZZ

winks at Shondra who sits next to Cohen on one side of
the pulpit Shapiro sees Louella Mcelroy looking strong
sitting on the other side The doors to the courtroom
open and Myazz walks in with Doo Doo Brown Flash bulbs

for an awkwardly long time then break and quickly peck
each other on the lips Doo Doo takes his seat in the

Swedlow appears behind Myazz

SWEDLOW

MYAZZ

Like a bird shot in the ass
The jurors enter the courtroom and file in

SWEDLOW

The Bailiff steps up

BAILIFF

Nakamura presiding

Myazz leans into Swedlow

MYAZZ
She’s a dragon lady Is that good
luck

SWEDLOW

You know what they say about Asian
women don’t you

MYAZZ
What’s that

SWEDLOW
Their skin is like whale blubber

The judge bangs the gavel

JUDGE AMY
Please be seated

Everyone sits

JUDGE AMY (CONTD)
The City of New York v Phillip Q
Myazz Has the prosecution readied
it’s opening statement

The handsome PROSECUTOR stands

PROSECUTOR
Yes your honor

JUDGE AMY
You may approach the jury

The prosecutor buttons his jacket and approaches

PROSECUTOR
Ladies and Gentleman of the jury
what we have here is an open and
shut case

(points to Myazz)

This case concerns the gross
negligence of that man Club owner
and Manhattan Socialite Phil
Myazz In the past few weeks Mr
Myazz has used the media to clean
up his renowned and irrefutably
rotten public persona

The prosecutor continues as Myazz leans into Abrimowitz
and Shapiro

MYAZZ
This whole thing is like a role
play I love my little prosecutor

ABRIMOWITZ
He’s a very handsome man

MYAZZ
He looks like Marky Mark Wahlberg
meets boyish Tobey Maguire with a
dash of steely eyed Alec Baldwin
He’s a roan creature A mixed

breed

SHAPIRO
Mr Myazz you’re making us
jealous

MYAZZ

I’m sorry Wanna bump

Myazz has a bump of cocaine in his pinky nail

ABRIMOWITZ
How the hell did you get that in
here

MYAZZ

I have my little hiding place
Want me to tell you where it is

ABRIMOWITZ
Why shatter the mystique

Back to the prosecutor

PROSECUTOR
And so ladies and gentleman I
believe that after you hear the
gut wrenching testimony of Louella
Mcelroy the victim’s mother you
will find Mr Myazz guilty beyond
any reasonable doubt

The prosecutor concludes and takes his seat

JUDGE AMY
Have the attorneys for the defense
readied their opening statement

Shapiro looks at Abrimowitz and then rises He takes a
deep breath

SHAPTRO
Yes your honor we have

JUDGE AMY
Then you may approach

SHAPIRO
Thank you your honor

Shapiro approaches the expectant jurors

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
Good Morning The prosecution
claims that this is an open and
shut case He’s correct Ladies
and gentlemen today I will
present evidence that will bust
this case wide open and shut it
very quickly

Shapiro approaches his table and Abrimowitz hands him a

manila envelope Shapiro looks at Swedlow who gives him
an assured smile He heads back to the jury

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
In this manila envelope I hold
evidence that will convince you
all to make a just and moral
judgement in this case

He reaches into the envelope and pulls out a stack of
glossy photos He hands them out to each member of the

jury Swedlow turns to Abrimowitz

SWEDLOW
Why didn’t I get a glimpse at this
evidence beforehand

ABRIMOWITZ
You were too busy playing golf
and riding in helicopters sir

The jury looks at the photos with confused reactions

SHAPIRO
Ladies and gentlemen what you are
looking at are photos taken from a
cell phone that accurately depict
the true vile nature of Club
Wannabe These include photos of
Mr Myazz abusing cocaine along
with others in the backstage area
of his club Quite shocking
aren’t they

The jurors study the photos Myazz looks perplexed
Swedlow sinks in his chair They both turn to Abrimowitz

MYAZZ
What the fuck

SWEDLOW
Where is he headed with this
Paul

ABRIMOWITZ
He’s headed to the right place

Back to Shapiro

SHAPIRO
Even more shocking to know that my
associate and I snapped these
very photos last night at the
club’s re-opening In one photo
you’1l notice that a man sits
behind Mr Myazz freebasing
cocaine

(MORE )

SHAPIRO (CONTD)
That man is none other than
acclaimed hip-hopper Doo Doo
Brown A close associate of Mr
Myazz’ and a member of our pulpit
today

Shapiro turns and points to Doo Doo who looks pissed
Swedlow stands

SWEDLOW
(fuming)
Objection Irrelevant

JUDGE AMY
Mr Swedlow you can’t object to
your own opening statement

SWEDLOW
(big baby)
Why not Who says

JUDGE AMY
I do But I wonder Mr Shapiro
what is the relevancy of dragging
Mr Brown’s name into these
proceedings

SHAPIRO
For the answer to that I would
like to ask my associate Paul
Abrimowitz to present the
evidence he has in his possession

Abrimowitz stands grabs the audiotape and joins
Shapiro A loud murmur erupts in the pulpit as well as
in the jury Judge Amy bangs her gavel

JUDGE AMY
Order in the court Gentlemen
what’s this all about

ABRIMOWITZ
Your honor I hold in my hand an
audiotape revealing Mr Myazz’
secret plot to have the late
rapper Fiasco murdered by Doo Doo
Brown

The whole courtroom erupts into gasps and murmurs
Shondra and Cohen look at each other nervous Doo Doo
shifts in his seat Myazz does another bump Judge Amy
bangs her gavel again

JUDGE AMY
Order

Swedlow stands desperate

SWEDLOW
Your honor may I have a word with
my team

ABRIMOWITZ

We have nothing to say to Mr
Swedlow your honor We simply
request permission to play this
audiotape for the jury

Judge Amy thinks for a moment

JUDGE AMY
I’1l allow it

The bailiff grabs the tape player and Abrimowitz pops the
tape in and presses play The incriminating conversation
between Myazz and Doo Doo from the night before plays for
the courtroom At it’s conclusion Myazz just giggles
Doo Doo looks around panicking

SHAPIRO
And so you see your honor this
situation is tragic

ABRIMOWITZ
Mr Brown and Myazz’ plans were
quite drastic

SHAPIRO
Causing havoc and panic

ABRIMOWITZ
Their habits were disastrous

SHAPIRO
We can’t have this The fact is
our client is very spastic

ABRIMOWITZ
We had to trash this The case
the client the rapper whose raps
are plastic

SHAPIRO
We rabidly askThat you convict
these nasty bastards

Judge Amy is silent The whole courtroom waits with
anticipation Then

JUDGE AMY
I’m going to call a recess to
examine and consider these latest
findings In the meantime Mr
Myazz is to be handcuffed and
brought into holding Court is
adjourned

She bangs the gavel The bailiff slaps handcuffs on
Myazz who turns to Swedlow

MYAZZ
Francis

SWEDLOW
Don’t worry Phil We can get you
out of this mess

MYAZZ
I thought they liked me I always
told them how cute I thought they
were

Doo Doo bolts out of the courtroom Abrimowitz and
Shapiro head over to Shondra and Cohen Shondra jumps
into Abrimowitz’ arms Cohen gives Shapiro a pound Ms
Mcelroy steps up to Shapiro and kisses him on the cheek

MS MCELROY
Youre a good boy Just like my
son James

Shapiro smiles Everyone heads out of the courtroom and

CUT TO

EXT COURTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Outside on the steps reporters are gathered around Doo
Doo grilling him Swedlow grabs Abrimowitz and Shapiro
and gets in their faces

SWEDLOW
How dare you You cost my firm
it’s reputation You can bet I’1l
stop at nothing to destroy your
legal careers

SHAPIRO
We have no problem with that

ABRIMOWITZ
Our legal careers were destroyed
when you asked us to lie and
manipulate the justice system

SHAPIRO
Goodbye Mr Swedlow

They walk away from Swedlow as reporters rush into
interview him They head down the steps along with
Shondra and Cohen when suddenly they hear screams coming
from behind them They turn to see that Doo Doo has
pulled a gun and is pointing it at Shondra Everyone
ducks for cover except for Shondra who faces down the
barrel of the gun tough and brave

DOO DOO
I wish I was the one that killed
your brother But now your momma’s
gonna have two dead children

He cocks the gun and pulls the trigger The gun fires In
slo-mo Abrimowitz jumps up and in front of Shondra The
bullet catches him in his shoulder He hits the ground
screaming in pain Police rush in and tackle Doo Doo to
the ground Shondra falls to her knees in front of a
bleeding Abrimowitz Shapiro and Cohen rush to his side

SHAPIRO
Are you okay
ABRIMOWITZ
(writhing)
It is painful
COHEN

SHAPTRO
We did it man

ABRIMOWITZ
We did didn’t we I’d love to
celebrate but I think I’m going
to pass out from how much this

Paramedics show up with a stretcher and lay Abrimowitz on
it They wheel him away to the ambulance The others
watch him go

SHONDRA
He is so brave

SHAPTRO
For real

COHEN

I just hope he’s not in any pain

The ambulance doors close and the ambulance takes off
down the street as we

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

Abrimowitz is laid out in a hospital bed eating Jello
and bragging to Shapiro and Cohen

ABRIMOWITZ
Do you guys realize that if I ever
wound up going to prison for
committing a crime my bullet hole
scar would keep me from getting
ass raped

SHAPIRO
‘Cause you look like a bad ass

COHEN
Yeah but what if your cell mate
chose to fuck you in the bullet
hole

The three guys share a laugh as Shondra enters with

balloons flowers and a few members of F-Squad trailing
behind her

SHONDRA
How’s the man who saved my life
feeling
ABRIMOWITZ

Much better now that you’re here
Shondra leans over and kisses Abrimowitz on the cheek

SHONDRA
I brought you some balloons some
flowers and a special guest

ABRIMOWITZ

Shondra turns to F-Squad

SHONDRA
Clifford

A hooded figure emerges amongst F-Squad He removes his
hood It’s Fiasco

FIASCO
What’s happenin’ homies

SHAPIRO
What’s up Fiasco

FIASCO
Just thought I’d come down here
and thank you in person for
getting Doo Doo arrested and more
importantly for taking a bullet
for my little sister

ABRIMOWITZ
As much as it hurt and it was
really painful I would gladly
do it again

SHONDRA
Clifford I’m in love with this
man

FIASCO

I know I may need some time to
process that I guess I can look
forward to some half white nieces
and nephews

SHAPTRO
Half Jewish

SHAPIRO

FIASCO
And look like a motherfuckin’
phony Risk havin’ beef with
another murderous psychopath I

Cohen interjects

COHEN
Fiasco with all due respect you
ain’t giving a proper ear to what
my boys is sayin’ Everyone knows
Doo Doo tried to kill you No one
would think you were a phony for
fakin’ your own death And think

about the PR angle “Tha Come Back

to Life” tour That shit would be
lucrative

SHAPIRO
We could negotiate the deal with
the record company

ABRIMOWITZ
And have the death certificate
reversed

Fiasco considers this

Abrimowitz

FIASCO
I would love to get my hands ona
mic again move the crowd but
shit I don’t have no stage show

SHAPIRO

Each has a briefcase in one hand and a mic in the other
The crowd doesn’t know what to make of this Abrimowitz
blows Shondra a kiss she blows one back Cohen reaches
up and hands Shapiro an open bottle of Grey Goose vodka
He takes a swig then looks out into the crowd and
notices two hot groupies licking their lips at him He
smiles and licks his lips back at them Abrimowitz and
Shapiro start rapping

ABRIMOWITZ and SHAPIRO
We fought the law and the the
law won Two motherfuckers united
as one We both took the floor
for the same common cause No
doubt motherfuckers we Attorneys
at Raw Attorneys at Raw son
Attorneys at Raw No doubt
motherfuckers We Attorneys at
Raw

The hook is hot and their rhymes are even hotter Fiasco
emerges from the wings and joins them on stage backing
them up rapping along with them The crowd loses it’s

mind Bulbs flash Fiasco grabs Abrimowitz and Shapiro’s
arms and raises them in victory Freeze Frame And we

FADE OUT

THE END
