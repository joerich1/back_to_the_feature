March 29 2002

FADE IN
EXT A HYPERBLUE LOS ANGELES SKY -- DAY

The sky is overlaid with the slow whup-whup-whup of an LAPD
helicopter flashing through the frame here and gone

LAPD radio transmissions crackle like static electricity
around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the
puckered asshole of Eagle Rock

A mans terrified voice screams invisibly from the house --

MALIKS VOICE
Im gonna kill this dog You make my
wife talk to me or Im gonna shoot this
fuckin dog

A five-member SWAT tactical team appears out of nowhere--full
black assault gear M5s gloved and masked--hustling into
position on either side of the front door Only now do we
get the full picture Helicopters overhead radio cars
surrounding the house an army of cops itching the pull the
trigger --
When the tac team is good to go the team leader gives a
thumbs-up to --

SERGEANT JEFF TALLEY AND LT MURRAY LEIFITZ

Talley and Leifitz are hunkered behind the LAPD Command and
Control van lLeifitz is the Crisis Response Team SWAT

commander Talley the primary negotiator Its so hot out
here that Talley has stripped down to a tee-shirt and vest

LEIFITZ
Theyre good to go Talley Your word
and were in the house

TALLEY
No ones going anywhere L-T We can
talk this guy down

Talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone thats been hardlined
into the house his tone reasonable and friendly --

TALLEY (CONTD)
(into the phone)
Hey George George dont kill the dog
okay We dont want to hear a gun go off
in there

A phone crashes through the window and lands in the front
yard --

MALIKS VOICE
(screaming from the house)
Fuck you

LEIFITZ
I dont think he wants to talk

Frustrated Talley slumps back against the van as the SWAT
Intelligence Officer Lloyd Keith scuttles up to them --

TALLEY
Wheres the guys wife

KEITH
She didnt take the kid to her sisters
The neighbors were wrong

TALLEY
Goddamnit you said we had her I told
him we had her

KEITH
We got bad information Talley I cant
pull her out of my ass

Up at the house George Edward Malik steps into the window
Malik is a forty-year-old freaked-out loser who has turned
the corner on insanity --

MALIK
(shouting at Talley)
You said my wife was gonna talk to me
you lying fuck Im gonna kill her dog
then shoot myself I mean it

Talley stares at Malik thinking then abruptly grabs Keith
by the collar --

TALLEY
(to Keith)
Pull the dogs name out of your ass Get

the dogs name

Talley steps out from behind the command van so that Malik
can see him

LEIFITZ
(alarmed by Talleys move)
Talley Youre in the line of fire

Talley ignores Leifitz he is totally focused on Malik and on
defusing the situation --

TALLEY
I didnt lie to you George You scared
your wife pretty good last night Were
having a hard time finding her

MALIK
She better talk to me Im gonna kill
her goddamned dog

TALLEY
You and I have been talking for what
sixteen hours Keep talking Is that
your dog too

Malik steps away from the window --

MALIKS VOICE
I dont know whose dog it is She lied
about everything else so she probably
lied about the dog
TALLEY
I know youre hurting You lose your
job you find out your wifes fucking
another guy but dont give up
Well have her talk to you

MALIKS VOICE
Then why wont she open her mouth Why
doesnt the bitch say something

Something about Maliks statement bothers Talley The
wording is odd suspicious --

TALLEY
George Come back to the window

MALIKS VOICE
STOP LOOKING AT ME

Talley grows even more concerned Was Malik talking to him

TALLEY
George Leave the dog alone and come to
the window

Talley sees Keith rejoin Leifitz --

TALLEY (CONTD)
(to Leifitz)
Whats the dogs name

LEIFITZ
The neighbors say he doesnt have a dog

The pieces fall into place for Talley The wife that no
can find the dog that doesnt exist

MALIKS VOICE
OPEN YOUR GODDAMNED MOUTH OR IM GONNA
SHOOT THIS DOG

one

In a single terrible moment Talley realizes that Malik is

not talking to him hes talking to his wife --

TALLEY
Murray Theyre in the house His
wifes in the house

Even as Talley screams a gunshot echoes from the house
freezing the moment A second shot follows the first as
tactical team breaches the front door --

the
Talley sprints forward running as hard as he can in
nightmare slow motion --

INT MALIKS HOUSE -- DAY

Talley shoulders inside on the heels of the tactical team
through drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight SWAT cops
are cuffing Malik even though hes already dead of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound Maliks wife is sprawled on the
couch where she has been dead for fourteen hours two tac
officers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that
sprays from the neck of Maliks nine-year-old son even as one
of them screams for the paramedics --

Talley is numb its all too much too heavy too horrible
He kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boys
hand He stares into the boys eyes and the boy stares
back The childs face grows pale as he drains of blood We
hear his heart beating We hear it slow We hear it stop

Talley stares at the dead boy The dead boys lifeless eyes
stare at nothing

TITLES

Another hyperblue sky but now were in an upscale bedroom
community in the sun-scorched high desert north of LA --

A legend appears One Year Later
EXT KIMS MINIMARKET AND GAS STATION -- DAY

A rotted-out Toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the
minimart white-boy hip-hop booming on the radio which dies
with the engine --

Dennis Rooney is driving twenty-three years old working-
class desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding
good looks In the middle Kevin Rooney nineteen scared
shitless at what theyre about to do Riding shotgun Mars
Krupchek twenty-four a large pasty guy with a shaved head
and faraway eyes

KEVIN
Cmon Dennis this is stupid I thought

DENNIS
(grins past Kevin to Mars)
Mars Whattaya think dude Out here

Mars slides out of the truck He has a tattoo on the back of
his tattoo that says BURN IT

As soon as Mars is gone Dennis frowns at Kevin --

DENNIS

KEVIN
Robbing this place is gonna put you back
in prison

DENNIS

KEVIN

DENNIS

Dennis pulls a pistol from his pants to check the magazine

DENNIS (CONTD)

movies

Mars returns and nods his approval --

MARS

Thats all it takes

INT KIMS MINIMART -- DAY

Junior Kim Jr is short squat and forty-two years old
Hes reading a magazine behind the counter when Dennis and

Mars enter Dennis trying to disarm him with a smile --

As Dennis reaches the counter he lifts his tee-shirt to
reveal the butt of his pistol --

DENNIS
A pack of Marlboros for my friend and all
your cash you gook motherfucker

But Junior Kim is ready He lurches to his feet bringing up
a pistol of his own --

MARS
Hes got a gun

Dennis lunges across the counter grabbing Kims gun and the
two men are suddenly locked in a ferocious death-struggle for
possession of the weapon --

DENNIS
Mars help me --

Dennis and Kim bounce from the counter to the Slurpy machine
the Glock locked between them pointing first one way then
the other their eyes meeting as -- BAM -- the gun goes off

Junior Kims eyes widen Dennis and Junior both look down at
the red blossom that grows on Junior Kims chest --

KEVIN
(screaming in the background)
Dennis Dennis someones coming

Kim falls into the Slurpy machine then slides to the floor
Dennis scrambles over the counter and sprints for the door

But Mars hesitates Instead of running he picks up Kims
gun then leans over the counter to look at Kims body We
cannot see his face --

EXT THE MINIMART -- DAY

A forty-something soccer mom named Margaret Hammond is about
to enter the minimart when Dennis and Kevin burst out
knocking her on her ass Mars follows a moment later --

Margaret watches their red pickup lurch away then rushes
into the store --

INT THE TRUCK -- DAY

Dennis power-shifts into gear clashing tortured metal as he
pushes the Toyota as hard as it will go No one is talking
theyre screaming --

KEVIN
Theres fuckin blood all over you
DENNIS
I didnt know he would have a gun It
just went off

Dennis sees himself in the rearview mirror His face is
splattered with red dew the sight of it freaking him out --

DENNIS (CONTD)
Jesus Fuckin Jesus its on my face

The trunk careens crazily off the road Mars calmly runs a
hand over Denniss face --

MARS
Relax Its only blood

Dennis upshifts hard again the truck lurching as the tranny
howls --

DENNIS
FUCK you Mars I got it all over me

-- whereupon the tortured transmission gives with a loud BANG
and the truck loses power --

DENNIS (CONTD)
MotherFUCKING piece of SHIT

EXT FLANDERS ROAD -- DAY

Flanders Road is lined with trees hedges and the exclusive
housing developments that dot the countryside around Bristo
Camino

The Toyota jerks to a stop well off the road and Dennis
Mars and Kevin pile out stuffing pistols and bullets into
their pockets --

KEVIN
That womans gonna call the cops

DENNIS
Shut up goddamnit Just calm down

KEVIN
What if hes dead What if you killed
him

Dennis grabs him by the throat Mars steps between them --

MARS
People are looking

looking He releases his brother --

DENNIS

KEVIN

following --

attaches a label reading Al then places it in a palm-sized
case beside the first disk Marlon --

WALTER (CONTD)

Walters ten-year-old son Thomas suddenly charges around

the back of the house --

Welch turns on his lights just as he sees the red Toyota
pickup abandoned on the side of the road and stands on his
brakes --

INT THE SMITHS KITCHEN -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

The Smiths home sports an open floor plan with the kitchen
centrally located between a large family room a hall that
leads to the front of the house and the French doors that
open onto the pool area

Jennifer is putting the finishing touches on three tuna
sandwiches as she calls to her brother --

JENNIFER

Dennis grabs her hair and pulls her away --
INT SMITHS OFFICE -- DAY

It happens fast Dennis shoves Jennifer into the room and
Mars and Kevin follow with Thomas --

Walter is feeding a computer print-out into a paper shredder
as they burst through the door --

DENNIS
Get your ass in the chair Sit down

Dennis shoves Jennifer to the floor and stalks directly
across the room his gun trained on Walter

Walter freezes hands motionless letting the paper feed into
the shredder Strangely he has little outward reaction --

WALTER
(quietly)
Jen Are you all right

DENNIS
Shell be dead if you dont put your ass
in that chair

Walter carefully sits He is amazingly calm in the face of
this invasion

DENNIS (CONTD)
Kevin Dont stand there asshole close

Walter Kevin closes the shutters as Dennis rips the
electric cord from a lamp --

WALTER

Walter glances toward the shredder the final page of paper
emerges as spaghetti and then the shredder stops --

WALTER

Jennifer doesnt answer Her eyes fill until two huge tears
roll down her cheeks Welch grows uneasy Something is

wrong but he doesnt know what He stays where he is --

INT BRISTO CAMINO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY

Its the kind of small-town police facility you might expect

and a desk officer who thinks that crime is two teenagers
egging a house

The camera establishes the low-key atmosphere during which
it finds a glass door labeled J Talley chief of police --

INT TALLEYS OFFICE -- DAY

Jeff Talley is behind the desk his voice muted because he is
locked in a painful phone conversation --

TALLEY
(into phone)

a job in the middle of nowhere

Intercut Talley who considers the photographs that decorate
his wall Shots of Talley in happier times with Jane and
their teenaged daughter Amanda Talley as a young SWAT

Talley studies the picture of his wife and daughter He
focuses on Amanda --

and goes to the refrigerator Shes fifteen and carrying the
weight of a seriously bad attitude --

JANE
(to Amanda)
Its Dad He wants to speak with you

Talley knows and he hurts like hell because of it --

TALLEY

eyes trying hard to keep herself together

AMANDA
I dont wanna go up there I want to

Jane stalks away without a glance back and Amanda angrily
flips off her mother --

interrupted when his assistant an older woman named Louise
Vance bursts in --

car as a shield More shots ping off his car as Talley
climbs out --

bullets caught him beneath his vest Talley cant waste
time The siren is closer now --

case into the drawer then lifts out a thick booklet --

Talley realizes that his officers are staring at the
helicopter as if theyve never seen one these people have
never dealt with a crime this large and have probably never
even seen a felon Talley keys the mike again --

TALLEY (CONTD)

INT WALTERS OFFICE -- DAY

Jennifer and Thomas are bent over their father wanting to
help but not knowing how Walters eyes flicker as if hes
dreaming and the lump on his head is bleeding --

JENNIFER
Hes not waking up He should be awake

Jennifer abruptly stands and faces Dennis --

JENNIFER (CONTD)
He needs a doctor

DENNIS
Shut up and sit down You think

Jennifer is scared--really really scared--but she doesnt
sit down Both Dennis and Mars are staring at her She
feels naked and vulnerable She crosses her arms again --

JENNIFER
At least let me get some ice for his
head

Dennis finally relents and shrugs at Mars --

DENNIS
Make sure Kevin isnt fucking off back
there

Jennifer hurries out as Mars follows --
INT THE KITCHEN -- DAY

Jennifer goes to the counter Kevin is at the French doors
nervous and scared Mars is a dark shadow behind her --

She kneels to a low cabinet when Mars kicks it shut --

MARS
I thought you wanted ice

Mars towers over her his groin inches from her face --

JENNIFER
Im getting a wash cloth for the ice

Mars gazes down at her enjoying his size and power He
steps closer bringing his groin closer to his face
Jennifer stands holding her arms across her breasts --

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Please get away from me

KEVIN
(from the background)
Mars What are you doing

Kevins intrusion shatters the moment Jennifer quickly
snatches a wash cloth from the cabinet then takes an ice
tray from the freezer and brings it back to the counter --
As Jennifer puts ice in the wash cloth she sees the paring
knife that she used for the sandwiches partially hidden by
paper towels --

She glances at Kevin but cannot see Mars hes at the
refrigerator behind her Jennifer slowly reaches for the
knife --

MARS
Hey

Jennifer freezes terrified She pushes the knife behind the
Cuisinart to hide it then turns Mars is offering her a
beer

The sun has set The donut shop glows greasily at the end of
a strip mall It is empty except for the overweight woman
behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth --

INT THE DONUT SHOP -- NIGHT

The man in the booth is named Marion Clewes Hes an average
looking guy more or less except for the strange cant to his
right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white J
C Penney shirt His jacket doesnt fit quite right but not
so much as youd notice Marion could disappear into a crowd
just by being so ordinary Thats the point

A fat black desert fly heavy with juice and thorny with
coarse hair buzzes past --

Marion watches it only his eyes moving --
The fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table --

Marion watches it then suddenly with no warning his hand
flashes out slamming down on the table

He holds his hand in place feeling for movement then slowly
peeks under his hand --

The fly oozes sideways legs kicking trying to walk One
wing beats furiously the other is broken --
Marion examines his hand A smear of fly goo and a single
black leg streaks his third finger Marion touches his
tongue to the smear --

The woman behind the counter watches this her eyes widening
with disgust --

Marion holds the fly in place with his left index finger and
uses his right to break away another leg He eats this leg
too --

The woman disappears into the rear --

Headlights flash across the glass and Marion swivels around
to see Howells Mercedes pull up --

Marion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen
Howell takes a seat across from him Howell puts the yellow
slip with Talleys address on the table --

HOWELL
Talley lives here I dont know if the
place has security or not

Whatever you want Page me when youre

done

Howell starts away then turns back --
HOWELL (CONTD)
Donuts here any good

MARION

wing flutters --

A shadow moves behind Kevin Its Mars standing in the
door He holds up a wicked claw hammer --

MARS
Look what I found

He enters and tests at Jennifers binds --

MARS (CONTD)

As Kevin reties the bindings Mars rips the phone from the
wall He smashes the phone jack with the hammer crushing

it Then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into
the sill nailing the window closed --

Mars returns to Jennifer and once more checks her binds --

MARS (CONTD)

He tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her
mouth --

KEVIN

He massages the tape into her skin slow sensual --

MARS
Go downstairs Kevin

to kiss her but instead he sniffs smelling her --

expose his chest A large tattoo in flowing script is lined
across his body A Mothers Son

MARS (CONTD)
It cost two hundred forty dollars but I
was happy to spend it I love my mom

Mars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if
he were diseased He fingers the lumps sensuously as if
touching them excites him --

MARS (CONTD)
My mom burned me with cigarettes

Jennifer is both disgusted and terrified Mars stares at her
emptily for another moment then lowers his shirt and leaves
without another word

INT THOMASS ROOM -- NIGHT

The room is dark Thomas is tied firmly to the bed The
cords cut into Thomass wrists and Thomas cant reach the
knots but Mars made one mistake He tied Thomas to the

headboard posts and one of the newels has been loose for
years --

Thomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel then
twists it back and forth He works it harder and harder
until the newel slides off its pin and suddenly his hand is
free though still tied to the newel --

Thomas peels the tape from his mouth then unties the
remaining binds and frees himself from the newel He slips
off his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet --

The crawlspace is a long triangular tunnel that follows the
edge of the roof It was built for plumbers and air

toward her along the wall --

THOMAS (CONTD)
I figured out what these cameras can see

Thomas reaches up from behind Jennifer and jerks the tape off
her mouth --

JENNIFER

see him --

JENNIFER
No ones coming

THOMAS

Bigelow opens the stretcher and locks out the frame He
peels back Walters eyelids and flashes a penlight --

TALLEY (CONTD)
Hows he look

BIGELOW

As Bigelow sets a cervical neck brace Talley gets the creepy
feeling that hes being watched He turns toward the
shutters and finds a pair of eyes only inches from his own
Its Mars

Talley stares at Mars and Mars stares back Its as if
theyre locked in a contest of wills until --

BIGELOW (CONTD)
Lets get him on the stretcher

Talley turns away to help Bigelow --

BIGELOW (CONTD)

TALLEY

Bigelow climbs behind the wheel and starts the ambulance
Talley pounds on the wall shouting --

TALLEY (CONTD)
Stop the fuckin engine

Klaus and Bigelow are both staring at Talley Sheriffs and
Talleys own officers have gathered at the open rear of the
ambulance to see what all the shouting is about --

Klaus pointedly looks at Talleys hand gripping his arm He
speaks slowly trying to make Talley understand --

KLAUS
Im not going to wake him I dont even
know that I can

TALLEY
Just one question Please

KLAUS

away then strides back through the banks of lights to the
nearest patrol car He grabs the dash mike and keys the
public address --

TALLEY (CONTD)
(through the pa)

Talleys voice echoes across the neighborhood Every cop in
the cul-de-sac stares at him He has addressed the house

then he throttles back --

but instead she glances back

darts across the hall to --

INT WALTERS OFFICE -- NIGHT

The office is lit only by the flickering candles Thomas

Marlon Al

INT THE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

The Starflash grenades burn out as Talleys amplified voice
echoes into the house --

himself into a ball and tries not to breathe --

Mars is in the room

The desk is a great oak monster big as a boat It sits on
curvy legs that leave a gap between the desk and the floor
Thomas can see feet --

The feet go to the windows --

DENNISS VOICE

The feet turn toward the desk Thomas tries to squeeze
himself smaller --

DENNISS VOICE (CONTD)
Mars What the fuck are they doin

Thomas scrambles from under the desk and darts across the
hall --

EXT THE BACKYARD -- NIGHT

Talley approaches the house He can see flashlights moving
in the kitchen --
TALLEY
Come on Dennis Talk to me

Dennis doesnt answer so Talley moves closer He spreads
his hands wide --

TALLEY (CONTD)

Dennis comes to the French doors He stuffs his pistol into
his pants and opens the doors --

DENNIS
You got a sniper out there gonna shoot

TALLEY

Only if you try to grab me We couldve
shot you from the wall

Dennis considers that and accepts it He steps out of the
house and walks over to Talley --

TALLEY (CONTD)
Youve been in there a long time
Whatre you waiting for

DENNIS
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison
for the rest of your life

TALLEY
Id be trying to get the best deal that I
could

DENNIS

Dennis Rooney steps closer because he doesnt want anyone
else to see the wad of money he pulls out --

DENNIS (CONTD)
Thats fifty hundred-dollar bills Five
grand They got money in this house
Talley more than youve ever seen

Dennis pushes the money back into his pocket

DENNIS (CONTD)
How much would it be worth to you

TALLEY

whether or not it will do any good --

TALLEY

The man you sent to the hospital is a
criminal He has partners This is

their house and their money and they want

Denniss eyes fill with defeat and helplessness --

DENNIS

TALLEY

Give up Dennis Let these people go

The power is

inside and pulls the door closed the
swallowing him like dirty water

turned on The house comes to life -

As Talley turns away his phone once more rings --

Thomas changes disks and opens Al --

THOMAS
Yeah Heres a name This is somebodys
personal tax --

TALLEY
Who is it

THOMAS
Charles G Benza
(then noise in the hall)
Theyre coming

Thomas abruptly hangs up and the line goes dead in Talleys
ear

Talley recognizes the name as easily as an East Coast cop
would recognize John Gotti and realizes the stunning import
of Smith possessing Sonny Benzas financial records --

TALLEY
Sonny Benza Oh fuck
Talley sprints across the cul-de-sac to his nearest officer
Jorgenson and keys Jorgensons shoulder mike --

TALLEY (CONTD)
(into the mike)

METZGERS VOICE

Metzger steps into Walters room then reappears --
METZGER
Hey Hes waking up

Talley and Klaus press for the room --
INT WALTERS ROOM -- NIGHT

Walters eyes flutter open His voice is slurred but
understandable --

WALTER
Where am I

Klaus peels open Walters eyes passing his penlight over
one then the other --

KLAUS
Canyon Country Hospital Do you remember

It takes Walter a few moments to answer --

WALTER
Walter Smith

All of Walters memories come flooding back and he tries to
sit up Klaus forces him down --

WALTER (CONTD)
Where are my children

TALLEY
Theyre still in the house

Walter looks at Talley He has never seen Talley and has no
idea who he is --

TALLEY (CONTD)

police So far as we know your children

KLAUS
Chief Talley is the one who got you out

TALLEY
(to Klaus)
I need to talk to him Alone

This time Klaus is hard-pressed to refuse He nods then
steps away --
Talley turns back to Walter Smith and lowers his voice --

TALLEY (CONTD)
Sonny Benza has my wife and daughter He
wants the disks Marlon and Al He took
my family to make me help

Talleys eyes fill His tears drip on the sheets Walter
looks away --

WALTER
I dont know what youre talking about

TALLEY
Hes going to kill you Dont you know
that He cant take the chance that
youll talk

Klaus returns and places a hand on Talleys shoulder --

KLAUS
Thats enough

TALLEY
Another minute Please --

But when he looks back at Walter he realizes that another
minute will do no good Walters eyes are once more close

EXT HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Talley is pacing by his car in the deserted parking lot
pounds the hood cursing awash in rage and frustration --

And then a phone rings

Talley takes out the phones The white phone is ringing
The Watchmans phone --

Talley answers furiously the two of them instantaneously
screaming at each other --

THE WATCHMANS VOICE

A profound silence fills the parking lot both men now
purged When the Watchman speaks again his voice is
measured --

THE WATCHMANS VOICE

wants

TALLEY

THE WATCHMANS VOICE
My people are good to go You know who I

TALLEY

DENNIS

Dennis tips his glass like a toast --

DENNIS
Then we might as well die rich

KEVIN

Kevin slaps the glass away Dennis boils up from the couch
He grabs his brother and the two of them fall over the coffee
table Dennis hammering Kevin in a furious rage until he runs
out of gas --
DENNIS
Youre my fuckin anchor Kevin the
fuckin lead around my life that Ive

Dennis gets up and steps back --

DENNIS (CONTD)

crawl out of the room then looks at Mars --

One of the other men hands an MP5 to Mr Jones Jones
jacks the bolt to chamber a round He slings his gun without
answering --

MR JONES

Jones walks away and all Talley can do is follow --
EXT MARS KRUPCHEKS TRAILER -- NIGHT

Krupchek lives in a shithole

The trailer is dark and silent They walk to the door
carrying their Maglites Mikkelson tries the knob --

MIKKELSON

DREYER

Mikkelson pulls hard and the door pops open Both officers
cringe as a smell like simmering mustard greens rolls out at
them --
MIKKELSON
Christ that stinks

INT THE TRAILER -- NIGHT

Mikkelson switches on the lights as they step inside Dreyer
sees it first --

DREYER

teetering stacks of folded cereal boxes fill the counters and
sink and floor Hundreds and hundreds of Captain Crunch and
Count Chocula boxes all neatly folded and stacked --

Its filled with large glass jars She opens another
cupboard More jars Shapes float in the jars suspended in
yellow fluid Mikkelson and Dreyer examine the shapes --

DREYER

Mikkelson opens the fridge then slams it looking like she
wants to puke --

MIKKELSON

fridge wondering --

this Dreyer at a loss looks away --

MIKKELSON (CONTD)
He has human body parts in his
refrigerator He has five human heads

Mikkelson cant handle it any more She lowers the phone --
WITH TALLEY

The shock that Mikkelson is feeling sweeps over Talley as
well He takes a moment to get his head around this --

TALLEY
(into his phone)
Mickey Call the state Homicide Bureau
Dont touch anything just sit back and

MIKKELSONS VOICE

Talley lowers the phone as he stares at the house wondering
what sort of monster is in there with Thomas and Jennifer

His gaze shifts to Mr Jones who is watching him --

TALLEY

INT THE HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is scared by all the shouting but he waits in the
darkness until Dennis quiets and then we notice that he is

trying to reach the gun --

Thomas stacks two phone books on the bench then uses the
phone books as an extra step to reach the high shelf --

He can finally reach the gun case He puts it on the bench

confidence now he can protect himself and his sister

Thomas cups his hand over his flashlight like before and
turns it on A dark liquid like oil is spreading on the
floor

Thomas follows it with his light to the broom closet He
lets out more light and sees that the oil is red

Thomas knows that something terrible is behind the door but
he is drawn to it He reaches out --

Kevins lifeless body topples out collapsing in a heap at
Thomass feet His neck is cut so deeply that his head is
almost severed --

His eyes are open
Thomas screams

JENNIFER
I dont know what youre talking about

Mars turns off the lights

JENNIFER (CONTD)

When Mars reaches her he touches the hammer to the chest
pressing to make it hurt --

MARS (CONTD)

JENNIFER
Stop it

Mars rakes the claws slowly between her breasts as Jennifer
finds the knife in her shorts She jerks free the blade and
stabs blindly burying the knife high in his chest but Mars
doesnt even step back --

He grips the handle moaning hideously as he pulls out the
knife A red flower blossoms from the wound

Jennifer tries to get past him but he grabs her throat and
pins her to the wall --

He raises the knife to her face --

DENNIS

Mars pounds on the door with the hammer They can see him on
the monitors Slow rhythmic pounding Then he walks away --

JENNIFER
Whats he doing

They can see him on the monitors--moving through the hall
going into the entry

Mars picks up a bucket of gasoline He splashes gas on the
walls and floor all the way back to the bedroom and then he
empties the bucket on the security rooms door --

Mars looks up at the camera again and takes out a match He
flicks it with his thumbnail and it flares --

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Ohmigod hes going to burn us

Mars tosses the match and the room erupts into flame --

they need to move into the house now --

MR JONES

TALLEY
Those kids are in there with a fucking
psychopath He kills people

MR JONES

Thomas phone cuts out Talley turns toward the house and
sees a growing column of smoke He looks back at Jones --

TALLEY

Talley hurries away Jones stares after him then comes to
his own agonized decision He catches up --

MR JONES
Talley Well secure the house but then

Talley accepts that they move toward the house --
EXT THE SMITHS HOUSE -- NIGHT

The banks of floodlights abruptly shut off plunging the
house and grounds into darkness --

INT THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The fire is spreading following the gasoline trail through
the hall and the rest of the house a thick layer of smoke
covers the ceiling --

Mars sees that the outside lights have been turned off and
senses that the cops are making their move Thats all right

with Mars--hes been waiting to die for most of his life --

Mars checks the load in his pistol then melts away into the
dark --

A moment later throbbing music pounds the house --

EXT SMITHS HOUSE -- NIGHT

Talley and Jones slip up to a side window at the front of the
house Both are carrying fire extinguishers They peer
inside then Jones uses a pry bar to lift the window --

INT FRONT GUEST ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley enters first followed by Jones The air is thick
with smoke and the music is confusing the hall outside the

room is filled with flames --

Talley points toward the bedroom then uses hand signals to
countdown the launch--threetwoone --
Jones keys his throat mike to launch the strike --

MR JONES
Go --

They blast the flames with their fire extinguishers then
plunge into the hall --

INT MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The sliding glass doors shatter as one of Joness men
breaches the door As he rolls to his feet Mars shoots him
from the flames --

A second man rolls through the door and Mars shoots again
laughing as the man writhes in flames --

INT HALL -- TALLEY AND JONES

their way into --

INT THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Its an inferno as Talley and Jones come through the door
They spot the two men on the floor just as --

Mars rears up behind the flames He is shirtless and
glistening screaming maniacally is he fires his gun --

Talley and Jones fire in unison pounding Mars with bullets
and knocking him into the fire Mars thrashes and screams
burning alive --

Talley hears pounding inside the safe room Jennifer and
Thomas He fights his way to the security door which is
covered with flames --

TALLEY
The kids are in here

MR JONES
Wheres the office

TALLEY
Help me goddamnit we can get the disks

Talley expects that Jones will help but Jones is aiming his
gun --
MR JONES
We dont need you any more Chief We
can get the disks on our own

But before Jones can kill Talley Mars heaves himself up from
the flames firing wildly He hits Jones in the head --

Talley fires reflexively his powerful 45 kicking Mars
across the room and out the glass doors Talley turns back
to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire

extinguisher --

TALLEY

Thomas and Jennifer jerk open the door but shrink from the
heat Talley uses the last of his fire extinguisher then

pulls them into his arms --

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT
Talley shepherds Jennifer and Thomas past the flames --

open the door --

A wall of cops are out on the street waiting --

EXT MOTEL -- NIGHT

The motel floats like an island of light in the middle of
nowhere A few cars are scattered throughout the quiet
parking lot --

MIKE RUIZ

the road for Talleys approaching vehicle A radio
transmission crackles quietly --

MANELLIS VOICE
You see anything

Ruiz keys the mike --

RUIZ

Talley steps silently behind him and presses his gun to Mike
Ruizs ear --

LOU BUSTER

Buster is on the dark side of thge parking lot standing watch
outside the pool of light in the shadows --

Gravel crunches behind him Buster turns and --
Talley cracks him across the face with his 45 --
WITH TALLEY

He edges along the perimeter of the parking lot working as
close as he can to a Fat Man who is leaning against the green
Mustang --

The door to a ground floor room opens and Glen Howell steps
out Talley recognizes Howell from the big gold watch --

HOWELL
(to the Fat Man)
Keep your eyes open He shouldve been
here

Howell returns to the room The Fat Man steps away from the
Mustang and --

Talley slams into his blindside using the 45 as a club
The Fat Man staggers and Talley wraps an arm around his neck
in a choke hold running him at the door --

Talley rams the Fat man into the door knocking it open and
shoving the Fat Man through --

INT HOWELLS MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley explodes through the door with the Fat Man in front of
him like a shield --

TALLEY
(screaming)
Police

Glen Howell jerks out his pistol as he drops behind the bed
Duane Manelli rolls out of a chair aiming from the floor in
a two-handed grip --

HOWELL
Dont shoot Dont shoot him
Talley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men He
has his back to the wall and the Fat Man in front of him --

TALLEY
Wheres my family Wheres my family

All three men are sucking air like freight engines No

one is shooting but if one person fires everyone will fire
Everybody has something the other guy wants Thats the only
thing holding them back --

HOWELL
Take it easy Just take it easy Were
here to do business

TALLEY

You said they would be here goddamnit
Where are they

Howell releases his grip on the gun and lets it swing free
on his finger Hes trying to cool Talley --

HOWELL
Theyre close Let me make a call You
can see theyre okay

TALLEY
You said they would be here

Howell takes out his phone and presses a number Talley
shifts his aim from Howell to the Fat Man to Manelli --

HOWELL
(into the phone)
Put on the woman

Howell offers the phone but Talley is wary--he cant let go
of the Fat Man and he wont put down his pistol Howell
carefully holds the phone to Talleys ear --

TALLEY
(into the phone)

Howell backs away with the phone --

HOWELL

Talley takes out a single disk Its the one labeled
Marlon He tosses it onto the bed --

TALLEY
You get the other one when I have my
girls Not talk to them have them

HOWELL
Where is it

TALLEY
Close

Howell considers the disk If Talley has the second disk in
his pocket Howell could just shoot him But Howell cant be
sure --

HOWELL
I have to see if its real

Howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the
corner He inserts the disk and waits for it to read Hes
satisfied with what he sees --

HOWELL (CONTD)
All right Now the second one

TALLEY
First my girls I get my girls you get
the other disk

Howell stares at Talley again then picks up his phone --

HOWELL
(into the phone)
Bring them Stop the car outside the
room but dont get out

The car pulls up directly outside the door It was only
seconds away Marion Clewes is driving Jane and Amanda are
wedged into the front seat beside him Jane next to Marion
Amanda on the far side They are bound tight with their
mouths taped immobile and helpless their eyes wide with
fear --

HOWELL (CONTD)
(into his phone)
Aim your gun at the womans head If he
doesnt give me the disk kill her
Marion presses a gun to Janes temple --

Talley jerks his gun toward Howell --

TALLEY
Ill kill you You wont get the other
disk

HOWELL

If you shoot me hell kill your
daughter Do you want to lose both of
them

Talley aims at the man in the car he aims at Howell He
tried so hard to save his family and now Howell has him
boxed --

HOWELL (CONTD)
The negotiation is over Talley I won
Now give me the disk or hell put her
brain on the glass

Talley looks at Jane and Amanda and his eyes fill He
mouths the words --

TALLEY
I love you

Hes saying good-bye

Talley drops his gun and releases the Fat Man who stumbles
away Talley tosses a second disk onto the bed Manelli
scoops it up and tosses it to Howell as Mation appears in the
door --

TALLEY (CONTD)
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and
theyre giving it to the real FBI This
ones a fake

HOWELL
Youd better be kidding

Howell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top --

TALLEY
Im a cop you asshole What did you
expect me to do Pretend all this never
happened

Howell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man
reading his own death sentence There is nothing on this
disk

TALLEY (CONTD)
Benzas over Youre over I just want
to take my family home

Howell stands like a mechanical man incredulous --

HOWELL
Are you out of your mind

MARION
(quietly)
You fucked up Glen

Howell looks over as if seeing Marion for the first time
gives him the order --

HOWELL
Kill them

Marion aims his gun directly between Talleys eyes then
points it at Howell --

MARION
No fuckups allowed

Marion shoots Howell in the head then the Fat Man then
Manelli--bambambam--one shot one kill

He lowers his gun considers Talley Talley doesnt
move

MARION (CONTD)
Its like a storm isnt it This raging
force that you cant control does
whatever it wants and the best you can
do is survive A winner survives

TALLEY
Why

The question being Why arent I dead Why arent you
killing me

MARION
What good would it do to kill you The
police already have the disk

Marion considers Talley another moment --

MARION (CONTD)

Your wife is a very nice lady

Marion goes to his car He helps out Jane and Amanda then
gets into his car and drives away

EXT THE PARKING LOT -- SUNRISE

Talley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family He
scoops up Jane and Amanda hugging them tightly as the camera
pulls up and away rising leaving this reunited family as
Marion Clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead --

CLOSING CREDITS
The credits roll to black then--

EXT SONNY BENZAS HOME -- DAWN

The garage door slides up Benza backs out in his Mercedes
then roars to the front door He pops the trunk then gets
out and hurries to the front door He sticks his head inside
and calls to his wife --

BENZA
The fucking jets waiting Would you get
your shit out here

He picks up two bags from inside the door and brings them to
the car --

AT THE TRUNK
Benza steps behind the raised trunk to put away his bags
When he steps back around again a nondescript sedan is

waiting in the drive --

A VOICE
No fuckups allowed

Gunfire erupts on the quiet ridge above Palm Springs
FADE OUT

THE END
