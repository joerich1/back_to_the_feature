INT DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME NY

Roberta is behind the counter meticulously wrapping a
with ribbons bows and stickers At one point she even
a ribbon and redoes it because its not perfect She

pretty but shes dressed conservatively like a navy
housewife Theres only one other clerk wrapping gifts

long line of impatient customers A male SUPERVISOR
behind Roberta

SUPERVISOR
Just wrap Youre not Picasso

He exits and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task
MALE VOICE (0S)
Picasso would probably put the bows
on the back of the box

guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket

ROBERTA
Brian Turner

BRIAN

ROBERTA
I thought you moved away

BRIAN

gesture
and tries to shake his hand

No -- thats her gift

(embarrassed)
Oh Sorry

Roberta hands him the gift shes been wrapping

BRIAN

INT COFFEE SHOP - ROME NY - DAY
Roberta sits opposite Brian Her lunch is untouched

ROBERTA
My college professors said it was
too late -- I hadnt had enough

training to be a concert violinist
So I got a teaching degree instead

BRIAN
Ill bet youre a great teacher

ROBERTA

I think I am Its just that

(sighs)
See every time Id get started
somewhere Charles would be
transferred then I had my kids
and took time off to raise them
and then when I decided to teach
again no one would hire me cause
you cant count on a navy wife to
stick around I finally decided Id
start my own program -- Charles gave
me the money and I bought fifty
violins from this little Greek shop --
got started at a private school and

then
BRIAN
Your husband ran off with your best
friend
A beat
ROBERTA
She wasnt my best friend She was
a friend
(beat)
Charles is the last person youd
think would cheat on me -- he never

broke a rule

I wake up one night -- its like one
in the morning -- and hes not in

this old Greek guy -- is sitting out
there smoking a cigar so I ask if

french fry

ROBERTA

ROBERTA
You sound like my mother

BRIAN

ROBERTA
Are you trying to be sexy or be my
friend

BRIAN

A little of both
Roberta smiles blushing a bit Brian looks at her
an idea

BRIAN
You know I know this really cool
lady who runs this elementary school --
I wrote a piece on her Its a public
school but its alternative -- she
might be able to create some kind of
gig for you Let me give her a call

ROBERTA
Great

BRIAN
(takes his last bite
of sandwich)
If she hires you though you have
to be willing to relocate

still annoyed by the intrusion but shes quickly won
over

Dennis joins in to be polite The three take bows A
beat

LEXI
Will you hire her now

Janet laughs then gestures for them to sit
JANET
How long have you boys been playing

NICK

LEXI
(contemplates then)
Maybe since I was three and a half

JANET
Your mom must be a good teacher

NICK
(shrugs)
Shes OK

Roberta gives Nick a look but Janet smiles

JANET
(to Roberta)
If you could teach our students to
play like that Id be thrilled but --

ROBERTA
I can Any child can learn the violin

DENNIS
Assuming they had the discipline

ROBERTA
Ill teach them to have discipline

JANET
A lot of our parents are struggling
to feed their kids and pay the rent --
they dont have time to help them
learn violin

ROBERTA
They dont have to If they can help
great -- but these kids will be

committed Theyll practice on their
own theyll help each other in the
classroom --

Dennis laughs Roberta looks at him a bit miffed

DENNIS
(with an edge)
I think I know these students Miss
Demetras Their attention span doesnt
go past do-re-mi Maybe on a good

Youre underestimating them They
can play as well as any other kids

extra program

JANET

havent noticed what youve done for
these kids

ROBERTA
Then do something

JANET

(points to her phone)
Ive been on this phone for the past

(to Roberta)
What if you do a benefit concert We
can raise a batch of money from ticket
sales and then the concert itself
could be great publicity Theres
word of mouth you could get
reviewed

It better be a good concert

Some people laugh but we see the anxiety on Robertas
face

We have to offer something more than
me and the kids

Do you think maybe your husband would
perform with us

(slyly)
Im sure I could persuade him with a
little pillow talk And maybe he can
get another violinist too -- Itzhak
Perlman perhaps

This gets peoples attention

Double everything has to be memorized

by next rehearsal
The kids look at each other daunted

ROBERTA
And you sound like youre
sleepwalking Your hearts not even
in it

VANESSA
Maybe cause we dont have a place
for the concert

Roberta looks at her and then notices the despondent

on many of the kids faces

ROBERTA
Well youre right This might all
be for nothing So we can either
keep on rehearsing in case we find a
place -- or we can just give up
DE SEAN
Am I hearing right Did you use the
words give up
(to the students)
Lets take a vote How many of you
want to give up

No one raises a hand Roberta takes this in

PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS IS ROBERTAS POV

She stands on the empty stage gazing at the ceiling as
slowly turns around Shes holding her violin case She
at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE
SEATS Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the

the stage then stops

CLOSE ON ROBERTA

We can see her imagining the audience on the night of
concert She cant believe her eyes A beat and she
around to make sure shes alone She takes out her
takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her

then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach
Concerto Suddenly theres the SOUND of a stage door
opening
Roberta stops

MALE VOICE (0S)
Incredible sound in this room no

Roberta turns to see ISAAC STERN approaching her Shes
completely flustered

ROBERTA
Oh my god -- Isaac Stern

ISAAC STERN

ROBERTA
Thank you so much for helping us

ISAAC STERN

(looking out at the

hall)
Would you believe in 1960 they tried
to tear this place down They wanted
to replace it with a bright red
skyscraper -- we called it the red
terror

ROBERTA
Youre kidding

ISAAC STERN
We had to fight like hell but with
a lot of help we saved Carnegie
Hall

Roberta takes this in relating it to her own struggle
ISAAC STERN
If its all right with you Id like
to play in your concert Maybe bring

a couple of friends

ROBERTA
Yes of course That would be great

Isaac nods then touches her shoulder

ISAAC STERN

cake but she shakes her head

ROBERTA
Yes but you dont understand
Maybe theres a good reason why I
never made it as a violinist -- maybe

I just cant cut it I keep blaming
it on not having enough early
training but if I were talented if
I had a gift --

DAN

But you do have a gift Youre gonna
put thirty East Harlem kids on stage

at Carnegie Hall not because theyre
prodigies but because you got them

to stick with something thats hard

as hell and to strive for excellence --
