HILLSIDE LATE AFTERNOON 1

The sun is dropping in the afternoon sky like a
heavy orange weight Ic rakes the lush green of
the mountains wich deep ocher streaks of lighc
A thin line of cloud boats overhead Like a
lavender scar

The dish looks too big for a man-made objecc Only
the fact that ic is such a perfece circlein the
middle of the asymmetry of the mountain ridges
makes it unnatural Otherwise ict would be a huge
eratorthe kind that become tourist attractions

It is over one thousand feet in diametera polished
white saucer cut into the side of the mountain
Suspended hundreds of feet above the center is the
receiverlooking Like a giant erecror set It is
supported by a spiders web of fragile looking cables

An almost imperceptible dot is moving slowly across
the expanse of the dish It is only afrer a while
that we realize that the dot is in fact a man

CuT TO
SNOW SHOES 2

A pair of feet are trudging over the fine mesh
surface They are walking on large circular
rubberized pads to protect the mesh Wind swirls
around the bottom of the dish giving off a constant
forlorn howl This is punctuated by the spongy
footsteps of the rubber pads

The shoes stop The man kneels down to inspect an
impurity in the surface This is the first time we
clearly see hin

HEYWOOD FLOYD looks like he is always someplace else
His fifty-year old eyes are piercing and direcc
yet they are also impatient Quite often they let
you know that he understands what you are going to
saywhen you are half way through saying itand
they are then off on some other thought while you
finish It makes you feel as if you are talking to
an egg timer with crows feets

He clearly wears whatever happened to be on top of
the nearest drawer On this particular dayit
turns out to be a loose fitting Hawaiian shire

baggy pants and no socks The loose fitting clothing
flaps in the prevailing windand his bare ankles
make the strange rubber protective snow shoes look
even more bizzare

2 CONTD

He is running his hand over the mesh surface He removes
small impuricies that have been collectedmeticulously
going from panel to panellike a gardener removing weeds
from a manicured Lawn

DIMITRI (V0)
Neatness is a good quality You
will make someone a fine wife

FLOYD looks up from his work The portly figure of DR
DIMITRI MOISEVITCH is trying to make its way up the slope
of the dish MOISEVITCH is an elderly man who sweats
profusely

He has the skin and body of a man who has spence a liferime
avoiding the direct rays of the sun His lack of athletic
talenc is enough to make walking up the dish a terrifying

journey for him The strange rubber snow shoes only make

matters a good deal worse for him

FLOYD stares at MOISEVITCH

MOISEVITCH
You are Doctor Heywood Floyd

FLOYD
Who the hell are you

MOISEVITCH
They told me at security that I
could find Dr Floyd up here
Ie is very difficult walking here
AlsoI1 am old Pleaseif you
are not Dr Floydcell me now
so that I dont have to try walking
all that way I dont mind dying
I simply dont wane to die in vain

FLOYD gives a slight shrug

FLOYD
Im Floyd

MOISEVITCH continues trying to negotiate the slope

MOISEVITCH
Im Moisevitch

We can see the impact this has on FLOYD
MOISEVITCH
Im here to talk abour your
problem

2 2 CONTD
FLOYD
Really What problem is that

MOISEVITCH
You were Chairman of the Nacional
Council on Astronautics Now you
are a school teacher This was
by your own choice

FLOYD
Im Chancellor of the University
not a teacher It pays better
What the hell business is it of
yours

MOISEVITCH
You were responsible for the
Discovery mission It was a
failure Someone had to be blamed
«0 it was you You like being
a teacher

FLOYD
I dont think I like you

MOISEVITCH takes a handkerchief from his pocket and
mops his brow

MOTSEVITCH
I read your final report about
what happened to Discovery You
left a good number of loose edges

FLOYD
Ends

MOISEVITCH
Loose endsthank youa number
of questions that remain unanswered

FLOYD
That was a classified report
(Pause)
I thought it takes the Russians
longer to steal our secrets

MOISEVITCH
How much time does it take for
your people to steal curs

FLOYD
About the same amount of time

2 2 CONTD
MOTSEVITCH
This is noc very good for ay
asthma Do you suppose that

you could meet me half way

FLOYD frowns for a momencand then gets to his feec
MOISEVITCH smiles to himself and mops his brow

MOISEVITCH
It doesn’t take a very smart man
to appreciate the risk I am
taking by being here with you
and you are a smart man Dr Floyd

FLOYD takes a deliberate step back down the slope of
the dish towards MOISEVITCH

MOISEVITCH
This is a very bad business in
South Americavery bad Ships
and other planes flying around
each other like angry hornets
Very bad

FLOYD
Who started it

MOISEVITCH
We are scientistsyou and I
Our governments are enemies
We are noc

FLOYD
Dr Moisevitchwhy dont you
try saying whats on your mind
MOISEVITCH

I want to play a game with you

FLOYD
I dont have time for games

MOISEVITCH
This is a good game

FLOYD rubs his chin He notices a large impurity in the
surface near his right foor He kneels down to remove it

MOISEVITCH
(Continuing)
Its called the truth
(MORE)

2 2 CONTD
MOISEVITCH (Contd)
(Pause)
For two minucesI will cell
only the truthand so will you

FLOYD
Two minutes

MOISEVITCH
Two minutes

FLOYD
A minute and a half

MOISEVITCH
A minute and three quarters

FLOYD
You go first

MOISEVITCH coughs into his handkerchief

MOLSEVITCH

We know you are building the
Discovery IIto go back up

to Jupiter and find out what
happened up there to your men
and to examine the large
Monolith You know
that we are building the Alexei
Leonovto also go up there

FLOYD
I thought you are going to eall
it the Titov

MOISEVITCH
We changed it last month
People fall our of favor

MOISEVITCH coughs again

MOISEVITCH
The Leonov will reach Discovery
almost a year before you people
are ready My government feels
that it is very important to be
the first ones there This is a
distinction that will look splendid
on the front page of Pravda
HoweverI am not sure what other
value it has

2 2 CONTD
FLOYD
One minute ten Why are you
telling me these chings

MOISEVITCH
Ahbecause there are things we
need to know Otherwise che same
thing that happened co your people
up there could happen to ours
and we would have accomplished
nothing I have about one minute
left

FLOYD
About

MOISEVITCH
The small Monolith you people
brought back from the Moon
your country has been selfish
and stupid in keeping it to
yourselves You never let us
examine it What have you found
our about it

FLOYD
Nothing It is impenetrable
Weve tried lasers even nuclear
detonators Nothing works We
just dont know whac it is
Forty five seconds

MOISEVITCH
The Monolith near Jupiter It
is the same

FLOYD
Te’s much larger Aside from
thatwe dont know

MOTISEVITCH
The computer on Discovery the
HAL 9000can it be reactivated
FLOYD
Yes
MOISEVITCH
By us
FLOYD

Possibly It would take three

to four months for someone not

familiar with the systemand

even longer than that to under-
stand the data

FLOYD

MOISEVITCH
I thoughe so
(Pause)

FLOYD
Thirty seconds

MOISEVITCH
Here we have our quandry we
will be there firstyer you
have the knowledge to make che
trip work

stares at MOISEVITCH We can hear the wind

howling around the dish The shadows are lengthening

-as

the sun is starting to kiss the horizon with an

orange splash

FLOYD

MOISEVITCH
How much more time do I have

FLOYD
You just got an extension
(Pause)
How could you convince your
people to allow Americans on
the flight

MOTSEVITCH

It wont be very easy however
Iam pretty good It is a
Russian craftflown by Russians

-carrying a few poor Americans
who need our help That also
doesnt look too bad on the front
page of Pravda

thinks about this for a moment

FLOYD

I dont know how I could convince
my people They wouldnt mind you
guys going up there and failing

(Pause)
They wouldnc mind at all

(Pause)
I donccheres no way thev
would do that unless they had to
--and since they dont have to

MOISEVITCH
Tell mehave you checked
Discoverys orbit lately

2 CONTD

2 CONTD
FLOYD
What

MOISEVITCH
Have you checked the orbit

FLOYD
What about ic

MOISEVITCH
Ie ts getting chilly hereand
that is very bad for my asthma

MOLSEVITCH starts to make his way back down the dish

FLOYD
Im sure theyve been checking it

MOISEVITCH conrinues walking away

MOISEVITCH
I have enjoyed our little chat

FLOYD
What do you know that youre
not telling me

MOISEVITCH coughs again in his handkerchief He is a
much smaller figure nowas he nears the hatchway at
the bottom

MOISEVITCH
You are a smart man You will
know whac to do

MOISEVITCH disappears down the hatch FLOYD remains
standing half way up the rimstaring ac the open hatch
The shadows are starting to reach the center of the dish
CUT TO
INT DATA ROOM - EVENING 3
FLOYD is sitting at a console in frone of a computer
screen The console is part of an enormous complex of
data banks that collece information from the dish —
A series of graphs are flickering in changing patterns on

the green screen They display various eclipses around
a large circle Streams of numbers accompany each graph

3 CONTD

FLOYDs eyes widen for an instance He strains forward

at the consolestudying the information in front of

him He cries to punch anew graph The same information
appears in front of him He stops and rubs his chin

He sics there for a momenthis face leaning close to
the screen The green light is reflecred in his eyes
Slowly he sits back His mouth begins the process of
forming a slow private smile

EXT LAFAYETTE PARK - DAY 4

FLOYD is sitting on a slatted bench with VICTOR MILSON
Behind themthe Whire House gleams in the crisp sunlight
of a spring morning The flag is billowing in the breeze

MILSON is the kind of man who looks comfcrtable in his

three piece suit and striped tie He wears elegant tortoise
shell half glassesthat are perched on his aquiline

Mose He is reading a blue file of papers His thin
attache case lies open by his side on the bench On his
other side sits HEYWOOD FLOYD who is throwing some crumbs
from the sandwich he is eating to a group of eager pigeons

MILSON
OhJesus
(Pause)
Youve double checked this
please say you havenc
(Pause)
Youre not saying anything

FLOYD

FLOYD throws a bread crumb on the grass He watches a
group of large pigeons scramble for itpushing a

smaller bird out of the way FLOYD quickly throws another
erumb directly at the smaller bird

MILSON
Weve got two more aircraft carriers
off the coast of Honduras The
Russians are moving some of their
big stuff in Now the Joint Chiefs
are screaming about Russian
satellites with anti-missile lasers
on them We have to put our laser
satellites up to counteract theirs
So the President has come to the
conclusion that the NCA should be
placed under the jurisdiction of
the Defense Department Enough
with the crazy scientists spending
all that money to try to talk to
Martians

reactive Discovery in a short time

MILSON

There are big answers up there
The Russians are going to board
Discovery with or without us You

solve the anomalies

How do we gec more information

That is obvious Someone must

floor He rests his head on the side of the poolopens
his smiling mouthand squeaks with satisfaction at the
damage he has caused He looks around for a compliment
with his mouth still openand emits a series of clicks

A five-year old boy leans over the edge of the pooland
strokes the top of the dolphins head The dolphin keeps
on clicking The boy reaches in a pailand drops a
small fish in the dolphins open mouth

made of lucite Four of them are empty FLOYD is in one
He has a number of small sensorsthact are attached to his
forehead chest left index finger and left toe There are
tows of monitoring devices on a panel over the container

FLOYD is wearing a pair of synthetic Long Johns He opens

his eyes He is disoriented He looks around There are
THREE PEOPLE in the room One is a middle-aged woman with
thick Russian features She is attending to the various
instruments that are measuring the data from the various
sensors She is DR KATRINA RUDENKO The second person is
VASILI ORLOVthe Chief Science Officer The third is

sit FLOYD puts his hand to his face He feels the
growth of beard It startles him We can see hin
trying to orient himself

We can see that CURNOW and CHANDRA are occyping the two

studying a pile of computer read-outs that are on the table

FLOYD

Have you done a spectral analysis
ORLOV

Of course I have

(Pause)

FLOYD

And
ORLOV

And what

FLOYD looks around the room Strips of light from the
extremely low ceiling bownce along the shiny table

FLOYD
Dr Orlov Im not taking a
survey If you did the analysis
what are the results

ORLOV
Nothing conclusive

FLOYD
What about a molecular breakdown

ORLOV
If you would look carefully at
the last page of the data
you will find the answers

FLOYD studies the stack of papers He pauses at the
last sheet for a moment ORLOV looks at him impatiencly

you have to forgive me Iuh

I seem to remember a processwhere
I ask you guys auestionsand you
give answersand you ask questions
and I give answers Thats how we
find out about things I think I
vead it in a manual somewhere

KIRBUK
Your government wanted us to awaken
you when we reported our findings
We did thar You are here to help
us reactivate the Discovery and its
computer systemsbecause that is
United States territory You are
authorized to observe other aspects
of our mission Other than that
we have no other obligation

FLOYD rests his mouth against his folded hands

Can we slow down

KIRBUK
No We dont have the fuel

ever encountered even remote signs
of chlorophyll on any of Jupiters
moons Never And two of yours in
eighty-nine and ninety-threewere
certainly close enough So were ours

Nine years agothe Monolith was
detected here Discovery was sent
upand then everything went wacko

(Pause)
Are you catching my drift

(Pause)
So here we arenine years later

happened and what the Monolith is
all aboutand guess what we find
on our way Suddenly there is the
possibility of life of some kind
where it never was before

awesome depth of the Jovian atmosphere

All of this fury is silentas viewed from space

When the first group of scienciscs huddled together in
the New Mexico dawn and wacched the firsc nuclear

had seen something that perhaps human beings werent
supposed co see Some of them cried That is what
JUPITER looks like from this proximity It is simply
too vastand is composed of too much force for us to
comprehend It is on another scale

FLOYD (V0)

Dear Caroline By the time you
get this message1 will either
be a headline on the evening news
right after the Central American
erisisor Ill be fine Either
waywhat I have to say to you
isn’t mooc

The LEONOV is heading towards this inferno It is
silhouetted against the yellow and orange swirls It
looks like a fragile fishy skeleton

FLOYD (V0)
(Continuing)
We are about to start the aero-
braking maneuver I told you
about it once The theory is
we will enter the oucer layer of
Jupicers atmosphere at just the
proper angle The atmosphere
will slow us downand Jupiters
gravity will grab hold of us
and sling shot us aroundbehind
the dark sideand back towards
where we are now This will slow
us downand put us in a gentle
orbit near Io Its kind of like
running down the street and grabbing
hold of a poleand swinging back
up the street again Its all
supposed to work Its dynamite on
paper Of course the people who
came up with the numbers on the
paper arent heretheyre back
home hoping theyre right The
problem is thar if we hit the
atmosphere at the wrong angle
we will either disintegrateor
go bouncing off into spacewith-
out enough fuel to ever get back

So if the numbers are rightand
the contracts havent cheated on
the structure of the Leonov
well be fine If notplease
dont let chem say too much slop
about me on the news

this brief time up hereIve been
given a glimpse of things I will
never understand and I will always
be affected by I can sense the
whole process up here Itc is so

EUROPA is a cold crescent behind JUPITER The brownish
fissure lines are still visible except hard co distinguish

It is IO boiling in the foreground The LEONOV is only a few
thousand kilometers from the surfaceand the sight is truly
terrifying

IO is a caludron of volcanic sulphur The surface exposed to
the sunlight is a brilliance rust colorwith dark brown
fingersof molcen sulfur dripping from the volcanic peaks

The dark side periodically explodes in a yellow flashas
the flux tube linking LO to JUPITER overloads with electrical
energyand discharges in protest

A voleano has erupted on the terminator A huge dirty
cloud is expanding upwardclimbing into the sunight It
looks as if it is sure to devour the LEONOV

Jupiter becomes a corona around the black center Then the light goes out
It is no more

There is a blinding flasht 1s of a size and brilliance that no one has ever
seen As the circle of light radiates outwardthe leading edge is almost green-
white Purples and lavenders mix with yellows at the centerwhich is becoming
translucent A ball of fire shines through the center A Nova has occured A
small sun has been born

The leading edge of the shock wave resembles the dreadful wave of heat and light
of a nuclear explosion It begins to loose intensity as it radiates outward from
the new sun

DISCOVERY is like a row boat in a tidal wave of light When the wave passes
DISCOVERY fs gone

of the engines and vibrating hull of the spacecraft are deafening

FLOYD sees that the shock wave is going to overtake them It fs simply a matter
of how much longer the engines can burn what s left of the fueland if they
are far enough away when it hitsso that fs will have dissipated
