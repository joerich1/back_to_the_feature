HENRY (VO) (CONTD)
Fitzgerald was one of the truly great
American writers of the 20th century
Tender is the Night The Last Tycoon
This Side of Paradise And of course
my favorite The Great Gatsby But
Fitzgerald ended up out here Writing
movies that never got made Drinking
too much Alienating people Losing
his way

2 EXT FITZGERALDGRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY

Henry stands on the sidewalk Full of promise and hope
Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment

INT ALAN AND COLETTES HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

seem a little uncomfortable Uncertain

CAPTION DR ALAN and COLETTE MOONEY
They look off to the side speaking to someone off-camera

Oh Really A documentary This
is going to be a documentary about
our writing group

He
COLETTE
The whole group Not just us right
Not that it should be just about
us

Nervous laugh

their disappointment

So this is going to be like--like
what I saw the other night on cable
About bees mating

COLETTE (VO)
(Reading)
»consumed totally completely
absolutely by endless thoughts of
Yuri fondling her breast his other
hand groping her womanhood knowing

They sit around the dining room table Colette convinced
shes the next Amy Tan reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES
The others all have copies in front of them We recognize
Henry the frog waiting to become a prince making copious
notes and Alan oh-so-proud hanging on every word Beaming

Three others round out the group

Younger MAN (early 30s) Unshaven Always thinks hes the
coolest guy in any room Cant avoid glances at the camera

folded as he listens shifting in his chair Captain Grumpy

intently the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on
her way here

CAPTION HANNAH RINALDI

COLETTE (CONTD)
Any second that she might explode
her chastity spraying across the
ceilingSpraying across the ceiling
like passionate graffiti Natasha
never thought such a moment possible
Have I satisfied you Natasha
Yuri had inquired after their fourth
round of vodka-soaked lovemaking
Nyet Not yet Natasha stated
exhausted but grateful

Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her
reading glasses and waits Alan clears his throat looking
cheerful

ALAN
Well Comments

INT HENRYS APARTMENT - DAY

Henrys sparse studio apartment Minimal furniture His laptop
is set up on an old door stretched across some blue plastic
crates

There are BOOKS piled everywhere All sorts of books And
PAPER -- pieces of paper including letters and cards and
printed emails dozens of them are taped throughout the
small apartment

We are introduced to Henry the writer pondering over his
battered laptop pacing up and down the floor checking his
nearly empty refrigerator stretched out on his Goodwill
couch watching TV

Finally inspiration Henry rushes to his desk and taps out
a sentence or two on his computer feeling proud for his
accomplishment

HENRY (VO)
I graduated from the University of
Illinois English major Taught
high school for a couple years but
hated it Moved out here to be a
writer

pizza in hand at the front door of a house Rings doorbell

I work two jobs Delivering pizzas
and cleaning carpets Good jobs for

ways people can reject you

dependable husband for a washed-up
young punk

All eyes on Colette She shifts in her chair Uncomfortable
COLETTE

An uneasy Silence Colette is blocked--nowhere to go
creatively Her face tightens up Bites her lip

Customer 1 reaches down and grabs the notebook from William
He tries to stop her but too late

WILLIAM (VO) (CONTD)
How else do you accurately capture
the misery of the human condition

She reads the page and shows it to Cutomer 2 who reads the
notes and is equally shocked

INT JOHNS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Full meeting of the writing group all crammed around the
dining table Henry and Hannah sit apart

A single BOWL OF PRETZELS has been placed before them Hannah
reads from her typed pages Alan William Colette and Henry
hang on her every word

John is half-listening at best more interested in the
MAGAZINE hes thumbing through

William REACHES UNDER THE TABLE and gently squeezes Colettes
hand Surprised she pulls her hand away

HANNAH
(Reading with feeling)

Please come home Michael Why
would you want to marry me Kyra I
barely graduated high school
Michael I dont care about some
silly college degree Youre the
most intelligent person Ive ever
known You are my shining star

Then Colette puts it back and squeezes Williams hand Its
his turn to be surprised

Hannah slides off her new reading glasses waiting for someone
to react The room falls silent Alan steps in

ALAN
OK Comments Anyone
No response Group members look at the pages At each other
No one steps forward
HANNAH

Colette seems thrown by the direct question

COLETTE

HANNAH
But my editor wants rewrites Am I

Colette punts Alan jumps in to save his wife
ALAN

John CLEARS HIS THROAT rather loudly What about me butthead
William ignores him

ALAN

group isisyoure fine We all
love it Nothing here to critique
You dont need us--well its not
that you dont need us but you

Alans voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper
More silence as Hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction
Finally looks to Henry for help

HANNAH
What do you think Henry

All eyes on Henry He hesitates Then --

HENRY
Yes Actually it is really good
but there are a couple things--little

Members of the writing group struggle to deal with Hannahs
latest success

Alan and Colette sit on their living room couch together
wearing matching pajamas staring straight ahead like zombies
His tape recorder sits on the coffee table Alan reaches

for it She grabs it from his hand and throws it

William sits at the counter of Restaurant 2 drumming his
fingers on the legal pad half-heartedly trying to write
WAITRESS 3 pours him some more coffee trying to make eye
contact with him William ignores her

John sits in front of his computer screen but he cant
concentrate Gives up Shuts down computer Flips on TV
Another war movie

Henry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters

Hannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working
at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep
deep sigh A lot weighs on her mind

EXT COLETTES GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

Alan steps outside Somber Focused Acts like the
Terminator in his scanning of the area Man on a mission
What is he looking for He finds it almost immediately
zeroing in on Colettes bench Alan marches over and grabs
Colettes prized framed photo of Oprah Clutching it in his
hand Alan looks at Oprahs smiling face then back towards
the house Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on
the ground as hard as he can Next he jumps up and down on
the smashed frame multiple times Not satisfied Alan bends
down picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands
There That felt good

Pool Guy and Gardener have witnessed the whole scene What

Colette stares at the letters focusing on remaining strong

COLETTE (CONTD)
(Reciting)
We keep going back stronger not
weaker because we will not allow--

Her voice cracks She stops Fighting for composure

COLETTE (CONTD)
--Rejection to beat us down--

Colettes frustration is boiling into anger as she struggles
to keep it under control

COLETTE (CONTD)
--It will only strengthen our resolve
To be successful there is no other
way Mr Henry D Thoreau

Short beat

COLETTE (CONTD)
Rejection sucks

EXT COLETTES GARDEN - DAY

Smoke rises from the fire pit burning whats left of the

You dont do the work

WILLIAM

Enough William flips off the group with his middle finger
Mumbling grumbling under his breath he starts to leave
Pauses at the WRITERS AT WORK sign Picks it up

ALAN
Not the sign

Too late William RIPS it in two And a second time for
good measure Throwing the pieces on the ground Stomps out
of the house slamming the front door

to be patient points to the framed sign on the counter in
large letters NO UNSOLICITED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE ACCEPTED

Colette and Dr Xiroman will not be deterred She holds a
thick MANILA ENVELOPE

Weve never seen Henry like this He rips down all his Richard
Benedict photos from the wall Collects all his Benedict

his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall Lot

of rejection Gives them a long look Then he snaps up the
photo of Hannah from near his computer He takes the photo

and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection
letters

Henry stares at the photo oblivious to the camera consumed
by Hannahs radiant smile His latest and most painful
rejection Its over

Henry understands what must be done He goes over to his
desk Sits down at his laptop One last glance over at
Hannahs photo as he turns the computer on

He contemplates for a second Then begins typing
