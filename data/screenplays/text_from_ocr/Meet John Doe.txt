Ext Bulletin Office - Sidewalk

Close-up Of a time-worn plaque against

at him while her immediate neighbors

look on with sympathy The office boy

with several other people All watch

him terror written in their eyes

Med shot Toward CONNELLs office door

look dourful The painter again has

to wait for the door to shut before

a slight flash of resentment in his
eyes

the drawers of her desk

Below is a letter which reached my

desk this morning Its a commentary

on what we laughingly call the civilized
world Dear Miss Mitchell Four years
ago I was fired out of my job Since
then I havent been able to get another
one At first I was sore at the state
administration because its on account
of the slimy politics here we have all
this unemployment But in looking around
it seems the whole worlds going to

pot so in protest Im going to commit
suicide by jumping off the City Hall
roof Signed A disgusted American
citizen John Doe

JOE pauses to absorb this
JOE
(continues reading)

Editors note If you ask this
column the wrong people are jumping
off roofs

JOE glances up toward ANN in mild protest

JOE

Hey Ann this is the old fakeroo isnt

all her things JOE stares at her knowing

ANN comes out Suddenly she stops
gets another idea picks up a book from
a desk and reaches back to heave it

Med shot At CONNELLs office door

The sign-painter has just finished CONNELLs
name and as he leans back pleased

wiping his brushes the book flies in

wrath too great to find utterance

his schooling his first job A wide-eyed
youngster facing a chaotic world The
problem of the average man of all the
accomplishment

John Does in the world

Two shot ANN and CONNELL Despite himself
hes interested in her recital

ANN

Now then comes the drama He meets
discouragement He finds the world has
feet of clay His ideals crumble So
what does he do He decides to commit
suicide in protest against the state
of civilization He thinks of the river
But no no he has a better idea The
City Hall Why Because he wants to
attract attention He wants to get a
few things off his chest and thats
the only way he can get himself heard

CONNELL
So

Full shot Of the whole group BEANY
grins in admiration CONNELL has leaned
back in his chair his eyes glued on
ANN

ANN

So So he writes me a letter and I dig
him up He pours out his soul to me
and from now on we quote I protest
by John Doe He protests against all
the evils in the world the greed the
lust the hate the fear all of mans
inhumanity to man

Arguments will start Should he commit
suicide or should he not People will
write in pleading with him But no

No sir John Doe will remain adamant
On Christmas Eve hot or cold he goes
See

She finishes takes a deep breath—awed
and at the same time proud of her

at ANN

(breaking silence-speaks with a controlled
patience)

upsets the painter from the stool When
the door is shut the name of Connell
which he has been printing is all smudged
over The painter stares at it helplessly
for a second and then—-unable to stand

it any more rises throws his brush
violently to the floor—after completely
smearing the sign himself

Full shot

CONNELL

(sighing)

Miss Mitchell do me a favor will you

DeLaneys The Delaneys live in a big
house with an iron fence around it and
they always keep their blinds drawn

his money so why bother about inviting
him Until Grimes the milkman spoke

up and he said Say youve got the
Delaneys all wrong And then he tells

us about how they cancelled their milk
last week and how when he found a

note in the bottle he got kinda curious

JOHN

and I can throw you right back there
again Youve got a nerve accusing people
of things These gentlemen and I know
whats the best for the John Does of
unbelievingly

America regardless of what tramps like
you think

Get off that righteous horse of yours
and come to your senses Youre the
fake We believe in what were doing
Youre the one that was paid the thirty
pieces of silver Have you forgotten
that Well I havent

Youre a fake John Doe and I can prove
it Youre the big hero thats supposed
to jump off tall buildings and things
Do you remember What do you suppose
your precious John Does will say when
they find out that you never had any
intention of doing it That you were
being paid to say so Youre lucky if
they dont run you out of the country

Why with the newspapers and the radio
stations that these gentlemen control

we can kill the John Doe movement deader
than a doornail and well do it too

the moment you step out of line Now

if you still want to go to that convention
and shoot your trap off you go ahead

and do it

Well that certainly is a new low I
guess Ive seen everything now

Wider shot As JOHNs lips curl up
and he steps up to the table

JOHN

(throwing his hat on the table)

You sit there back of your big cigars
and think of deliberately killing an
idea thats made millions of people

a little bit happier An idea thats
brought thousands of them here from
all over the country by bus and by
freight in jallopies and on foot—so
they could pass on to each other their
own simple little experiences

Close-up Of ANN Her eyes light up
happily

JOHNS VOICE

Why look Im just a mug and I know
it But Im beginning to understand

a lot of things Why your types old
as history If you cant lay your dirty
fingers on a decent idea and twist it
and squeeze it and stuff it into your
own pocket you slap it down Like dogs
if you cant eat something you bury

it

Close-up Of JOHN His voice is pleading

JOHN

Why this is the one worthwhile thing
thats come along People are finally
finding out that the guy next door isnt
a bad egg Thats simple isnt it

And yet a thing like thats got a chance
of spreading till it touches every last
doggone human being in the world-and
you talk about killing it

Full shot They listen to him—unmoved

JOHN

Why when this fire dies down whats
going to be left More misery more
hunger and more hate And whats to
prevent that from starting all over
again Nobody knows the answer to that
one and certainly not you with those
slimy bolloxed-up theories youve got
The John Doe idea may be the answer
though It may be the one thing capable
of saving this cockeyed world Yet you
sit back there on your fat hulks and
tell me youll kill it if you cant
use it

673

Well you go ahead and try You couldnt
do it in a million years with all your
radio stations and all your power Because
its bigger than whether Im a fake
Its bigger than your ambitions And
its bigger than all the bracelets and
fur coats in the world

by the name of D B Norton

Med shot Shooting towards audience

Wait a minute ladies and gentlemen
My name is D B Norton you all

I spent a fortune backing this man in
what I believed to be a sincere and
worthy cause just as you all did And
now I find out its nothing but a cheap
racket Cooked up by him and two of
my employees for the sole purpose of
collecting dues from John Does all over
the country

JOHN breaks away from the troopers and
gets to the mike

JOHN

Thats a lie

D B

Its not a lie Nickels and dimes To
stuff into their own pockets You can
read all about it in the newspapers

JOHN

Thats a lie Listen—-dont believe what
he says

D B

(overlapping above speech)

Let go of me This man had no intention
of jumping off of the top of a building
He was paid to say so

(turning to John)

Do you deny that

JOHN

Thats got nothing to do with it

D B

Were you paid for it-—or werent you

JOHN
Yes I was paid But the—

D B

(over-lapping above speech)
And what about the suicide note You
didnt write that either

JOHN

D B

Did you write it-—or didnt you
JOHN

No I didnt write it but—

D B

Ah you bet your life you didnt You
look in your papers ladies and gentlemen
and youll find Miss Mitchells signed

wrote it

JOHN

write the letter but this whole thing
started—

D B

There You see He admits it Youre

a fake John Doe And for what youve
done to all these good people—-they ought
to run you out of the country—and I

hope they do it

troopers
