INT SUTTER’S HOUSE BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

EXTREME CLOSE UP on a single BEAD OF SWEAT The skin it
belongs to is out of focus

VOICE (0S)
What have you learned from this and how
has it prepared you for the future”

The lone bead of sweat begins its slow descent

RACK FOCUS on the bead of sweat to REVEAL the “skin” is
actually a beer bottle

And then we SLOWLY PULL BACK to show who the voice and
beer belong to SUTTER KEELY 18 boyishly handsome
killer smile He takes a swig of the beer staring at a
college application on his computer

As he thinks about the answer we get a glimpse of
Sutter’s room A small desk A twin bed Clothes on the
floor Decorations include a baseball pennant from some
minor league team and a framed photo of the Rat Pack

BACK ON Sutter staring down the application An idea
comes to him He starts to type

SUTTER (VO)
“Dear Dean of Admissions My name is
Sutter Keely and up until yesterday I had
the best fucking girlfriend in the
world”

EXT CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - MORNING

Sutter pulls into the parking lot of a suburban strip
mall off the highway There’s a vast openness in every
direction The horizon unsettlingly far away

Like all great stories mine begins with
a breakfast burrito

EXT AIMEE’S HOUSE FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON 45

A small brick cube surrounded by a bare yard Some
shingles are missing from the roof and the original paint
color has faded away Sutter knocks

CHILDS VOICE FROM INSIDE
Aimee your boyfriend’s here

AIMEE’S VOICE (VO)
Shut up Shane

The door opens Aimee has put some effort into her looks
this afternoon Most notably she’s wearing lipstick
He’d never say so but Sutter would rather she wasn’t

AIMEE
Hi

SUTTER
Hey there

AIMEE
Come in

Sutter follows Aimee inside
INT AIMEE’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 45A

We take in the total mess that is Aimee’s living
situation Clothes piled up opened containers covering
the tiny coffee table VHS tapes scattered on the floor
Aimee’s little brother SHANE plays an ancient video
game system wearing shorts and no shirt

AIMEE
This is Shane my brother

SUTTER
Hello Shane

Shane flips Sutter the two-handed bird

AIMEE
He just learned that

SUTTER
Charming

AIMEE
We can study in my room

SUTTER
Lead the way

Sutter follows Aimee down the narrow hallway Notices

more mess some tacky wall hangings Sutter catches a

glimpse of Aimee’s step-dad RANDY taking a nap in one
room (dressed exactly like Shane) Finally they get to
Aimee’s bedroom

45B INT AIMEE’S HOUSE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 45B

Sutter is expecting the worst but when she opens the
door it’s an awesomely neat and colorful place clearly
a sanctuary from the world outside Sutter is impressed

SUTTER
Wow nice

AIMEE
I like to keep it clean

Sutter walks around the room admiring The back wall is
a giant map of the Milky Way There’s some pencil
drawings and ceramic cats scattered about On one wall is
a massive bookshelf covered in notebooks and paperbacks

SUTTER
You must really love reading
AIMEE
They’re mostly science fiction A few

mysteries

Sutter picks up one book that’s half in Japanese “Battle
of the Immortal”

AIMEE
(apologetically)
I know it’s weird

SUTTER
No that’s cool Weird is good I say
“embrace the weird” Why’s it backwards

AIMEE
That’s how you read them See

She shows Sutter how it works He’s impressed Notices on
the wall one of the pencil drawings -- an anime-style
scene of a woman flying through space

SUTTER
Is this you flying through space

AIMEE
No it’s um it’s nothing Just this
thing I like

SUTTER
Who is she

Aimee is embarrassed but Sutter silently encourages
her to answer

AIMEE
Shirei Migoto From the Gleaming Planet
books Stupid I know

SUTTER
If you like it it’s not stupid What
makes her so special

AIMEE
She’s the leader of the Neexo Ark It’s
up to her to escape the Dark Galaxy and
find the Gleaming Planet star system

SUTTER
(looking at another drawing)
I see

There’s drawings of the Commander everywhere

AIMEE
(still shyly)
She’s kind of my hero and stuff

Sutter feels exceedingly bad for this girl right now

SUTTER
You know what You’1ll be my hero if you
can straighten me out on this geometry
business

They sit down and get situated Sutter opens the book

AIMEE
How much of this have you read

Sutter looks up Smiles He hasn’t read a word of course

SUTTER
Well here’s what I don’t understand
When will I ever need to know this stuff
I mean seriously Vectors Slopes
Coplanar lines Who gives a shit Who
calculates slopes at their job

Aimee laughs can’t argue with that And then

VOICE (0S)
Aimee Come out here right now will you

The craggy voice belongs to Randy Hearing it saps the
fun vibe of the room almost immediately

RANDY’S VOICE (0S)
I thought you were going to get us some
milk

AIMEE
I will

RANDYS VOICE (0S)
Do it now crissakes The hell has she
been doing all afternoon

It’s quiet for a beat

AIMEE

Aimee smiles her sad smile starts putting on her shoes

SUTTER
Yeah sure No problem

EXT CONVENIENCE STORE COMIC BOOK STORE - DUSK 46

Sutter comes out of the convenience store with his Big
Gulp On the way to his car he passes a comic book
store Sutter walks right by before stopping

INT SUTTER’S HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT 47

Sutter finishes mixing a drink and sits down at his desk
We see a stack of Manga books which Sutter bought at the
store He puts his feet up begins to read in reverse

INSERT elegantly drawn images from the books the
occasional caption about dreams freedom the future

Sutter finds himself surprisingly captivated

We hear the chime of an Instant Message Sutter looks up
from the book to his computer He’s got a message from
“CASSIDY210” (Her icon is a seductive personal pic) The
message just says “Hey”

Sutter perks up This is a nice new development He
writes back Sutterand7 “Hey” (His icon Sinatra)
Takes a swig

Her message “How are you” Sutter drinks some more
Writes back “Fabuloso” It’s quiet for a few beats He
scratches his head thinking of the right thing to say

But then he gets this “I miss you” Sutter’s eyes open
wide Writes back “Will I see you at the party
tomorrow” Her message “Think so” Then as Sutter is
writing back she sends “Gotta go Talk soon” And signs
off Sutter returns his attention to the Manga but his
mind is now very much elsewhere

EXT LAKE SIDE PARTY SPOT - AFTERNOON 48

Beachfront Picnic tables Kegs Music Twenty or so high
school kids already in the swing of things Sutter and
Aimee approach the party Aimee wears an unflattering
purple jacket Sutter badly wants her to take it off

SUTTER
Sure you don’t want me to carry that

Aimee looks at him like “why” Oh well he tried As they
walk towards the keg pretty much everyone they pass says
“Hi” to Sutter or slaps him five He’s the king of these

high school parties At the keg he hands her a cup

AIMEE
Um I don’t really

SUTTER
You don’t have to drink it Just hold
Gives off the illusion you’re having fun
30A

Sutter looks around spotting Cassidy in a group of
partiers by the beach He shrugs it off turns back to
Aimee

SUTTER
See anyone you know

AIMEE
I don’t really know a lot of people

SUTTER
Well that my dear is about to change

Sutter downs one drink pours two more Gestures for her
to follow him They walk over to Cassidy’s group

SUTTER
Hey gang Who needs a refill

Sutter hands one to Cassidy who takes it

SUTTER
This is Aimee Finecky

Aimee shyly waves Awkward nods all around Sutter gets
the impression everyone is waiting for some incident
Well he’s not going to give them one

SUTTER
Everyone’s so serious tonight How bout a
joke What do you call a fish with no
eye
(they wait for it)
A fsshh

It takes a second but eventually Cass starts to laugh
The others join in

SUTTER
Heard that from an 8 year old running
away from home

Sutter sees Cody standing next to Aimee Gets an idea

Sutter extends his hand After a beat she shakes it
causing him to smile

CASSIDY

SUTTER

Sutter gestures he needs a refill

They walk back to the keg Sutter gets another refill So

hesitates but goes for it Can’t help but be charmed by
him - which is just when Marcus shows up

MARCUS

than a sip and is immediately coughing and choking

long table makes the “vomit” face to Aimee She laughs

HOLLY
I had no idea he was a big fancy lawyer
but I gave it to him anyway And I sure
am glad I did

lips Aimee rolls her eyes at this Signals for another
top-off from the flask which Sutter provides out of view
from the others

and he’s like yay big and I’m like yay
big so that’s bad Plus he’s fast
And his reach has got to be way out --

DAN
Sutter what are you doing You’re not a
fighter

SUTTER

Tell me about it

DAN
So why’s he want to fight you

SUTTER
I don’t know He must think I’m still
after Cassidy

DAN
Is he right

Sutter stops boxing (clearly winded) Takes a drink from
his Big Gulp

SUTTER
No I mean -- we talk a little Online
mostly
(off his look)
Just cause I want to keep in touch with
my ex doesn’t make me a bad guy Does it

DAN
Youre not a bad guy Sutter You just
don’t have a real good grasp of the idea
of consequences
INT CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON 67A

Sutter turns off the lights Big Gulp in hand Marcus
walks in

VOICE
What’s up with you and Cassidy

Oh shit it’s Marcus Here we go

SUTTER
Look man I don’t want any trouble

Marcus just stares Sutter down Intimidating

MARCUS
Tell me the truth

Marcus gets right up in Sutter’s face Sutter knows if
this gets physical he’s not gonna win

SUTTER
Nothing’s up We’re just friends She’s
moved on I’ve moved on

MARCUS
Youve moved on

SUTTER
(not convincingly)
I have

MARCUS
Come on man Everyone knows you’d drop
Aimee Finecky in a second if Cass would
get back with you

SUTTER
Everyone knows that Well guess what
everyone’s wrong Look Marcus trust me
ok We hang out sometimes we have fun
but I promise you nothing’s going on
between Cass and me

Marcus continues to stare Sutter down A beat And then
it’s Marcus who breaks the stare first He looks down at
his feet Sutter realizes something -- he isn’t angry
he’s distressed

MARCUS
Can I ask you something
SUTTER
Ohk
MARCUS

Why can’t it be me she has fun with

SUTTER
(beat not expecting that)
What

MARCUS
I’m not like you Sutter I don’t know
how to make her laugh and stuff I want
to I just I don’t know what to do

Sutter is thrown for a loop

SUTTER
Dude you’re Marcus West Star athlete
Class President What’s that charity you
started

MARCUS
The Hope Squadron

SUTTER
The Hope Squadron for fuck’s sake
You’re the man Marcus You don’t need my
help
MARCUS
The way she talks about you it’s not
the same I want her to like me like
that And she doesn’t I know she
doesn’t

Sutter is stunned to see Marcus so distraught and
vulnerable This is too weird

SUTTER
Look Marcus you don’t want to be like
me Ok I make jokes and stuff but you
you get shit done You’re gonna change
the world You guys are perfect together

Marcus’s mood is slowly improving Sutter is on a roll

SUTTER
You just need to loosen up a bit You’re
too tense

MARCUS
Maybe

SUTTER
Not everything has to be serious all the
time See a movie Maybe have a beer once
in a while

MARCUS
That’s not for me man
SUTTER
I’m just saying relax Enjoy yourself

you know Live in the now
Marcus sighs taking it all in

MARCUS
Thank you for talking to me like this
Sutter I appreciate it I really do

Sutter nods feeling pretty good about the whole thing
Marcus opens the door to go outside

MARCUS
Hey Sutter
(Sutter turns)
They’re wrong about you

SUTTER
What’s that
MARCUS
Youre not the joke everyone thinks you

are

Sutter flinches as if he just received the punch he was

expecting all along Marcus leaves and we remain on
Sutter thinking about that CUT TO

INT AIMEE’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM -— MAGIC HOUR 68
Sutter and Aimee sitting close together watching TV

SUTTER

Dad all the time He loved this stuff

SUTTER
Why are we talking about this
AIMEE

Sutter says nothing

AIMEE
Maybe you can ask your mom --

SUTTER
(Jumping up)
Goddamit Aimee Will you shut up already
Jesus Christ

Aimee’s face flushes red and she shrinks away This is
the first time Sutter’s gotten mad at her and it stings

AIMEE

Sutter hugs her tight He then lifts her chin to look at
him Then he kisses her The mouth The forehead The
eyelids Kissing the tears away It grows in intensity

69 INT AIMEE’S HOUSE BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 69
And now they’re on the bed kissing fondling

AIMEE
Can we take off our clothes

There’s no stopping it now Sutter lifts off Aimee’s
shirt Aimee takes off her own bra Sutter then takes his
shirt off Aimee helps him with his pants It’s awkward
but there’s a real romance to it Sutter sees Aimee in a
new light And he’s amazed at what he sees

SUTTER
Nudity looks awesome on you

They get under the covers together Feeling each other’s
bodies Aimee stops first Reaching over to the night
stand She pulls out a condom

AIMEE
Just to be safe

Sutter is surprised Girl’s got all the bases covered
Aimee helps him put the condom on And then pulls him
over towards her so he can be on top

AIMEE
I like you so much

SUTTER
You’re spectacular You really are

AIMEE
I’m so glad I met you

SUTTER
I’m glad I met you too

Slowly tenderly they begin to have sex Sutter looks
down at Aimee’s face Her eyes are closed It’s very
different from sex with Cassidy but in a way it’s better
More intimate More connected Sutter is entranced

69A INT AIMEE’S HOUSE BEDROOM - LATER 69A
They lie in bed together Post-coital

AIMEE
You’re incredible

SUTTER
Nah It’s easy to seem that way on your
first time
(Aimee looks away)
It was your first time wasn’t it
Aimee

Her silence says maybe it wasn’t

SUTTER
I thought you said you never had a
boyfriend

Aimee sits up pulls her knees to her chest Chin down
looking very distraught

AIMEE
I don’t want you to hate me

SUTTER
Hate you I won’t hate you You’re un-
hatable
AIMEE
It’s just something that happened I
was 14 I didn’t know anything about

couldn’t sleep and would I mind if he
came in talk for a while

SUTTER
Of course he did

AIMEE
He climbed in the bed And started
saying all this stuff to me

SUTTER
What kind of stuff

AIMEE
You know How warm I feel How much he
likes my mouth and my hair

SUTTER
Smooth talker this Troy

AIMEE
No one ever spoke to me like that It

SUTTER
How could you You were 14

AIMEE
I still should have known no 20 year old

And the worst part is when we
finished he couldn’t look at me Drove

away in the morning Haven’t seen him

If I ever see that guy -- I can’t believe

They both lie there quietly Aimee puts her head on his
chest Sutter sits there thinking Then he hears her

AIMEE

SUTTER

I don’t think you’re awful Why would you
say that

(beat)
Aimee don’t cry

(beat)
Ill tell you a secret My Dad’s not a
pilot I’m not sure what he is Or where

know I don’t know anything about him
He’s been gone half my life and I I
guess I just miss him

AIMEE

Doesn’t anyone know where he is
SUTTER

My mom does She refuses to tell me
AIMEE

She can’t keep him from you He’s your

father
Sutter looks away Uncomfortable
AIMEE
Ill make you a deal I’1l1 stand up to my
Mom if you stand up to yours

Sutter looks at her Aimee puts out her hand to shake

AIMEE

Sutter hesitates Then he just smiles touches her face
Instead of answering he says

And then they lay together She strokes his hair as he
looks at the ceiling

Tuxedo-clad Sutter stands with Aimee’s MOM and Randy
Aimee’s Mom has the camera out and is readying to take
some prom pictures

AIMEE’S MOM
Randy get in there with Sutter

The two men pose for the picture As odd a couple as
you’re likely to see Sutter pretends to be comfortable

Finally Aimee comes out She’s wearing the lipstick
again her dress is a pale yellow that doesn’t quite
match her skin tone and she’s done her hair up ina
leaning tower of Pisa style do An awkward girl trying
too hard to look elegant Sutter doesn’t care about that

SUTTER
You look fabuloso

AIMEE
Thanks So do you

They do the boutonniere corsage exchange Mom takes a
few more Randy loses interest walks away They say
their goodbyes and they’re off

The prom is already in full swing and it’s very much like
youd expect -- DJ punch bowl padded chairs white
tablecloths Sutter and Aimee arrive Through Sutter’s
eyes the place sparkles Aimee adjusts the straps on her
ill-fitting dress Sneaks a drink from her flask Sutter
takes her arm as they walk in

People greet him as they always do when he shows up to a
party High-fives etc Sutter and Aimee choose a half-
empty table to sit at Sutter pulls out a chair for her
like a gentleman

They sit and take it all in There’s Ricky sitting with
Beth And there’s Cassidy on the dance floor with
Marcus Her dress is amazing showing off her body in the
perfect way Sutter takes a moment to watch but quickly
returns his attention to Aimee They toast drinks Sutter
can’t help himself his eyes returning to Cass on the
dance floor Aimee eventually notices

AIMEE
She’s a good dancer

SUTTER
Hmm

AIMEE

Cassidy

SUTTER
Oh yeah I hadn’t noticed

Aimee doesn’t push the issue Sutter downs another drink
And so does Aimee The song ends and Cassidy sees Sutter
at the table She walks over with Marcus

CASSIDY
Why aren’t you dancing

SUTTER
You know I hate this kind of music

CASSIDY
Who cares It’s the prom Aimee c’mon

AIMEE
I’m not much of a dancer

SUTTER
That’s why you got me I can teach you
some of my moves

AIMEE

(taking a big sip)
I’m good right here You two go ahead

Sutter and Cassidy share a look

SUTTER
You sure

AIMEE
It’s fine

Aimee takes out her flask and re-spikes the drink Sutter
hesitates sizing up whether Aimee is telling the truth

SUTTER
If you change your mind

Aimee turns back around Sutter shrugs He and Cassidy
head to the dance floor Once they’re dancing

CASSIDY
She looks nice

SUTTER
She does

CASSIDY
You’re not turning her into a lush are
you

SUTTER
You wanna dance or lecture me about
Aimee

CASSIDY

LATER Sutter comes back with more punch He sits down
kisses Aimee on the cheek Aimee smiles Seems like she
means it Then again might be the alcohol Sutter takes xK

her hand and holds it at the table He looks around the
room Sees Ricky and Beth having fun Everything he sees
makes him happy

SUTTER

The song ends and a new one begins slower more
romantic Sutter grabs Aimee and gestures to the dance
floor This time she doesn’t resist They dance She puts
her head on Sutter’s shoulder

AIMEE
I’m sorry I can’t dance like Cassidy

SUTTER
You dance like Aimee And that’s perfect

jobs downtown Have you ever seen the
Liberty Bell I’ve only seen pictures but
it looks amazing

SUTTER
(beat)
Wow That’s that’s some plan Youve
really done your homework

AIMEE

And best of all my sister says there’s
tons of vacancies in her building cause
of the economy and stuff They’re not
expensive at all We could move at the
end of June Together

Sutter remains dazed silent

AIMEE
Sutter what do you think

Looking at Aimee Sutter knows there’s only two

possibilities Break her heart -- or just go with it
SUTTER
I think that’s a terrific idea Best

Ive ever heard

Aimee embraces him They kiss We can tell what she
can’t Sutter is not convinced about any of this

75B INT HIGH SCHOOL GYM - MOMENTS LATER 75B

Sutter and Aimee walk back into the room Aimee is
ecstatic Sutter looks pained now The joy of the buzz
completely sucked out of him

The prom itself seems to be equally pallid The room has
thinned out The glitter is crumbling The lame
decorations are half on the ground Depression
threatening Sutter makes his move

SUTTER
This is ridiculous

Hops up on the riser and grabs the mic from the DJ

SUTTER
Can I have everybody’s attention

The music stops There’s a little feedback from the mic
SUTTER

Come on people let’s pick this party up
This is our night

Some people yell out “woo Sutter” etc Aimee is by this
point too drunk to shout Others are less enthusiastic

SUTTER

How bout I add a little class to the
evening

(clears his throat)
Alanda2andal 2 3

(sings)
“Were dancing at the prom We’re singing
at the prom We’re um la la da da da”

Sutter doesn’t have the next line The crowd starts to
turn on him

SUTTER
Shit Um “Hey it’s a party”

Somebody yells “Sit down”

SUTTER
You sit down Dickhead

Other kids start shouting too “Go back to rehab” Etc
Mr Aster runs over to put a stop to it

MR ASTER
Alright Mr Keely that’s enough
SUTTER
I’m just warming up
MR ASTER
I said that’s enough
SUTTER
This is our night Mr Asterhole not

yours
Some people cheer the dig - but not everyone

MR ASTER
That’s it your prom’s over

SUTTER
Fine We’ll take this party elsewhere

Sutter drops the mic on the ground Hops off the riser
Stumbles a little but covers it up well enough He still
thinks he’s under control but the stares from his
classmates say otherwise Sutter pays them no mind
Cassidy runs up to him

CASSIDY
You have to take Aimee home

SUTTER
Cass where you been

CASSIDY
In the bathroom with your girlfriend She
passed out on the floor

SUTTER
Ouch Was it my singing

CASSIDY
This is not a joke Sutter

SUTTER
Ok ok Ill take care of her

CASSIDY
Do you even know how

SUTTER
Hey this is none of your business Cass

AIMEE
Stop

Aimee comes out walking at a bit of a tilt covered in
vomit angry

AIMEE
Get away from him

CASSIDY
I was just trying to --

AIMEE
I know what you were trying to do You
were practically dancefucking

SUTTER
Whoa

CASSIDY
Aimee --

AIMEE

Stay away from him you fat bitch

At which point Aimee winds up and slaps Cassidy across
the face hard This surprises everyone even Aimee
After a beat Aimee tries to steady herself against a
table the nausea returning Before she realizes she’s
vomiting again onto the floor Sutter rushes to her aid

SUTTER
Can you sit up Are you cut Come on
let’s get you up in this chair

He lifts her up gently Anyone still watching the scene
(which is most people) groan at the sight

AIMEE
I’m sorry I’m so sorry

SUTTER
Don’t be sorry It’s the prom things
happen at the prom

Sutter sees Cassidy still giving him that look the same
one he got a thousand times as her boyfriend

AIMEE
I’m such a mess

SUTTER
Youre beautiful Let’s get out of here

And with Cass watching as he helps her out of the room

AIMEE
I love you Sutter I love you so much

And this is like a gunshot to Sutter Of all the things aK
to happen tonight that one stings the most

BLACK

DAN

Youve probably noticed we’re not too
busy these days And because of that
well I can only keep one clerk

(Sutter nods waits for it)
You know I like you Sutter More
importantly the customers like you So I
think you should be the one I keep

SUTTER
That’s excellent Dan Thank you You
won’t regret it

DAN
Hold on a sec I’ve given this some hard
thought and the only way I can let you
stay is if you promise me 100 percent
that you’ll never come in here loaded
again

Sutter is taken aback Never thought Dan was on to him

DAN
I’m serious Not even a light buzz And
if you do one time I’m gonna have to
let you go Do you understand

SUTTER
I do

DAN
Can you promise me Sutter

Dan looks Sutter in the eye Sutter holds his gaze for a
beat then laughs to himself

SUTTER
Youve got me there don’t you Dan You
know I can’t promise that

Dan looks at Sutter disappointed hoping he’1l
reconsider Knows he won’t

DAN
I appreciate your honesty

SUTTER
I’m always up front with you

Sutter proud of himself rises to shake Dan’s hand

SUTTER
It’s been a pleasure working for you Sir

Dan stares at him a beat Then shakes his hand

DAN
I guess if I was your dad here’s
where I’d give you a lecture or
something ‘bout what you’re doing to
yourself

SUTTER
You know what Dan If you were my Dad
you wouldn’t have to

MARCUS

should keep quiet and hide in the corner
Well that’s not what I see I see someone
whose dreams are as big as all of yours
put together Someone who can stand up
for herself now I did that

RICKY
So you’re some kind of hero then

SUTTER
And that’s not me

CASSIDY
It could be Maybe If you tried

Sutter stands there for a moment without saying anything

SUTTER
If you really have this vast knowledge
about me and relationships then you’d
know I don’t need to break anything off
She’1l take care of that soon enough
just like you did

CASSIDY

And you think that was easy Say what you
want but you’re the one who made it
clear we didn’t have a future And I get
it That’s you that’s who you are But
Aimee’s different You’re her whole
world She thinks there’s a future with
you and there isn’t

SUTTER

Why do you want to dredge that up

SUTTER
Dredge Come on Holly Dad’s not
something you dredge He’s great
Remember how he used to tell us stories
out in the tent in the backyard

HOLLY
That was mostly you

SUTTER
Well you remember our vacation in
Mexico He had us going up to people and
asking ‘em ‘Where can we find the belt
buckle museum’ or ‘Why is there no
artichoke ice cream’ It was hilarious

HOLLY
It was embarrassing

SUTTER
People thought it was funny They loved
us
HOLLY
They loved you because you were little
and cute

SUTTER

But the guys loved you They thought you
were a hot little muchacha

Holly remembers then smiles

HOLLY
He did know how to make friends didn’t

SUTTER

Damn right he did

They sit in silence for a moment

SUTTER
Do you know happened Between him and
Mom

HOLLY

He cheated on her

SUTTER
That’s her version

HOLLY
You think it’s a lie

SUTTER
I’m not saying she’s lying I’m saying

HOLLY

SUTTER
Think about it She won’t let us see him
Won’t say where he is --

HOLLY
Let’s talk about something else How’s

SUTTER

Holly’s face shows that she’s thinking about it

SUTTER
I tried asking Mom but she refuses Will

Please Holl

HOLLY
(beat)
I don’t have to ask I know where he is

Sutter looks at her expectantly She goes inside for a
moment When she returns she hands Sutter a slip of
paper Sutter looks at a phone number then at his
sister Psyched

SUTTER

Sutter jumps up to go

HOLLY

notice over the moon at seeing his hero in the flesh

TOMMY

He takes Aimee’s hand then kisses it She blushes

TOMMY

silence Tommy doesn’t yet invite them in

TOMMY

the REGULARS greet Tommy when he enters much like
Sutter’s friends when they see him After a few hello’s

TOMMY
Everybody this here is my son Sutter

Everybody welcomes Sutter with raised glasses and pats on
the back Tommy seems proud Sutter and Aimee are elated
When they reach the end of the bar the bathroom door
opens and out comes ROBERTA (45 short dress trashy)
Tommy is surprised to see her

TOMMY
Well if it isn’t the most beautiful woman
in the state

ROBERTA
Last week you said “the country”

swirls of strawberry mixed in melting
into the ocean Everyone with a drink and
a smile

Wish you could have been there kiddo

SUTTER
So how come you left

TOMMY

Tommy looks in the direction of Roberta who is sitting
at the bar chatting with other men His stare lingers

SUTTER
Hey how bout some music

TOMMY
That’s a great idea You take care of
that I’1l go get us a refill

Tommy gets up and walks over to the bar Sutter goes to
the jukebox with Aimee

AIMEE
You OK

SUTTER
Never better

She squeezes his arm and smiles back Sutter finds
exactly what he’s looking for on the jukebox A song
begins to play They go back and sit down

ANGLE ON Tommy new pitcher in hand On his way back to
the table he stops and whispers something in Roberta’s
ear She eyes him flirtatiously

Tommy sits back down Sutter smiles expecting Tommy to
react to the music

SUTTER
(beat proud)
Pretty good huh

Tommy barely reacts surprising Sutter

SUTTER
Don’t you like this song

TOMMY
Eh this was always your mother’s thing

This is news to Sutter It’s a bit of a shock His only
response is to take a large drink of his beer

SUTTER
But it’s fun I can’t imagine Mom ever
having fun --

TOMMY
Are you kidding When we first got
married boy was she something Nobody
was more fun than that woman

Again Sutter is stunned

SUTTER
So what happened

TOMMY
(still looking away)
What do you mean

SUTTER
What happened between you two

Tommy had been watching Roberta this whole time He turns
to look at Sutter and says

TOMMY
(takes another drink)
Things don’t work out sometimes

Sutter processes Aimee watches him growing increasingly
concerned And then

SUTTER
You know she blames you for everything
Won’t even let us talk about you

Tommy does not seem the least bit surprised

SUTTER

I defend you though I always defend you
TOMMY

Thanks kiddo I appreciate that

(beat)
Wasn’t all my fault

SUTTER
Right Two sides to every story

TOMMY
Damn straight

SUTTER
And whatever happened she still
shouldn’t have kicked you out of the

house
TOMMY

Oh she didn’t kick me out
SUTTER

What
TOMMY

I left

Sutter can’t believe it Tommy sees the look on his face

TOMMY
I had to I mean I did want to be there
for you Man did I ever want that You
guys were more important to me than
anything in the world But well
things between your mother and I just got
to be so uncool Guess I wasn’t cut
out to be a family man not in the
traditional sense anyway

Tommy laughs The room is now spinning for Sutter Tommy
sees his face

TOMMY
You know how it is One thing leads to
another the girls don’t mean anything

SUTTER
Girls Like more than one

TOMMY
(shrugs)
Not like I kept a running tally But hey
I don’t live in the past I live in the
now That’s what it’s all about

Sutter looks like he might throw up Tommy sees Roberta
get up and leave the bar Tommy jumps up

TOMMY
Ill be right back Settle the tab for
me will ya

SUTTER
Um --

TOMMY
Thanks bud You’re a miraculous marvel

And with that he heads outside Sutter watches him go

AIMEE
Sutter

But he’s just sitting there staring out the window at
Tommy who’s now pressing up close to Roberta whispering
in her ear She laughs and playfully pushes him away

AIMEE
Sutter

Sutter snaps back to attention Opens his wallet to pay
Tommy’s bill He only has a few bucks He looks to Aimee
with embarrassment

AIMEE
Don’t worry about it --
SUTTER
I’m sorry --
AIMEE

Don’t be --
Tommy comes back inside

TOMMY
(winks )
So Roberta’s had a few too many drinks
Think I’d better give her a ride home If
you know what I mean

SUTTER
Oh Um do you want us to follow you
TOMMY
I got it covered Won’t be more than an
hour
SUTTER

Why don’t we come with you We’re not

Sutter angrily turns on the ignition pulls away
INT LARRY’S SUTTER’S CAR - NIGHT 89

ANGLE ON SUTTER in the driver’s seat The car is not
moving And he is totally silent

REVEAL what Sutter is looking at his father right back
at the BBQbar Tommy tips back the last of his beer and
laughs at something one of his buddies said

BACK TO SUTTER Frozen Aimee doesn’t know what to say
Without a word Sutter composes himself Drives away

IE HIGHWAY SUTTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 89A

We stay with them in the car The silence continues
Sutter looks like he’s about to burst Aimee watches
expecting an explosion any moment She puts on the radio
tuning until she finds a baseball game They listen for a
few moments Sutter angrily turns it off

More silence Sutter takes a long swig Finally

AIMEE
I’m sure he wanted to come back --
SUTTER
Aimee --
AIMEE
You saw her She was in no condition to
drive
SUTTER
Please --
AIMEE

I bet that’s what happened If it wasn’t
for her he would have come right back

SUTTER
Sure and if he hadn’t cheated on mom
then we’d still be a family and I’d be
president of my Sunday school class and
you and I would ride silver stallions to
Pluto

This shuts her down Sutter glances over feeling bad for
snapping Takes a deep breath and another drink

AIMEE
Maybe we caught him on a bad day

SUTTER
And maybe that’s just who he is Huh
Maybe he’s been like that since day one
Just a selfish lowlife motherfucking
asshole

Sutter shakes his head in disgust at himself Aimee stays
silent Until

AIMEE

I love you
Sutter exhales Not what he wants to hear right now

AIMEE
Did you hear me

Sutter still won’t engage

AIMEE
I love you

SUTTER

SUTTER
Because --

AIMEE

say it Can’t stop now

SUTTER

just drunk and you’re grateful
someone came along and showed interest in
you

AIMEE
Don’t say that Sutter Don’t try to mess
this up --

SUTTER

Mess what up What do you think this is

At which point a loud horn blares from an oncoming car

AIMEE
Watch out

All this time the car has been swerving slowly into the
other lane Sutter quickly rights the wheel and the car
fishtails in the other direction With no seatbelt on
Aimee slips down into the floorboard as Sutter struggles
to regain control

The car sideswipes a concrete abutment before Sutter is
finally able to wrestle it to a stop in the high grass
off to the left facing the wrong way (passenger door
closest to the road)

AIMEE

SUTTER
Jesus Christ Aimee what are you sorr--

But he doesn’t get the rest of it out She’s hit Knocked
off of her feet by the blow of an approaching car She
goes down hard

Sutter freaks jumping out of the car running as fast as
he can to her side Aimee lies in the grass face caked
in mud blood dripping from her scalp She isn’t moving

SUTTER
Aimee oh fuck Aimee What have I done

Sutter kneels over her falling apart Terrified

SUTTER
Please God don’t do this Oh please

help but smile Then she collapses again

tree and opens an envelope labeled “Diploma” It’s empty
He’s not surprised

Sutter looks up to find Mr Aster watching him from
across the way He expects to see him gloat But Mr
Aster isn’t gloating He just looks sad and walks off
Sutter is thinking about that when

AIMEE
Hello Handsome

Aimee wraps her arms around him Kisses his cheek She’s
never looked happier She takes out her flask and spikes
a drink As she’s about to do the same for Sutter he
stops her Not today Aimee shrugs takes a swig

AIMEE
Is your family here

SUTTER
I told them it was next week

Aimee laughs Sutter can’t help but smile at her We see
Krystal standing with her family She waves Aimee over

AIMEE
I should go say hi Be right back

She runs off Sutter remains alone for a beat He sees
Cassidy off with a GROUP OF CLASSMATES They make eye
contact - so much history between them There’s a moment
where she thinks about walking the other way She makes a
decision Approaches a sad smile on her face

driving He looks in the rearview mirror the bar still
in view beckoning

INT SEEDY DIVE BAR - NIGHT 99

thuggish MEN play pool on a wrinkled table Sutter sits
at the bar next to a DRUNK in his late 60s The BARTENDER
has a wispy goatee and is missing some teeth They’ve all
been there a very long time

SUTTER
Another round for the table
(BARTENDER nods)
Thank you Earl thank you for serving
me This is better Much much better

DRUNK
You’re a good guy Sutter

SUTTER
That’s what I think too I agree
(to BARTENDER)
Did I do the right thing

BARTENDER
For you or for her

The question doesn’t get to hang for too long as the
Drunk chimes in

DRUNK
You had to let her go You had to save
that girl

SUTTER
That’s what I did I saved her

DRUNK
You’re not wrong You’re a hero You’re a
King

SUTTER

Youre exactly right

DRUNK

Shit

A light turns on inside the house Sara comes outside
pulling a robe around herself

SARA
What the hell
(seeing the mailbox)
Sutter

Sutter ignores her Mom watches him stumble to the house

SARA
Have you been drinking

Sutter says nothing
SARA

Jesus Christ We just went through this
The hell is wrong with --

SUTTER
What do you care

SARA
Excuse me

SUTTER

You don’t care about me You’ve never
cared about me

SARA
(stunned)
Sutter --

SUTTER
It’s cause I remind you of him

SARA
What are you talking about

SUTTER
That’s why you hate me That’s why you
can’t stand to look at me

SARA
How can you say that You’re my son

SUTTER
I’m his son too We’re exactly the same

SARA
You’re nothing like him

Sutter won’t listen He storms past her and walks inside
Mom follows

about to climb the stairs hears his mom rummaging in the

Sutter looks at the slip

SUTTER

(beat)
I was wrong Take this Go see him See
for yourself how different you are

Sutter is stunned by this

SUTTER
I’ve already been

Now it’s Mom’s turn to be surprised

SUTTER
Holly gave me his number and we drove
there last week You were right

He’s you were right all along

And Sara knows what Sutter is really saying

SARA
You’re not your father

Sutter tries to hold himself together but he can’t look
his mother in the eye Sara grabs him into a hug Sutter
allows it but doesn’t respond not yet

SARA
(beat)
Sutter listen to me That man that
man’s never loved anyone but himself His
heart is this big But you you love
everybody You’ve got the biggest heart
of anyone I know

Sutter’s hit hard by this Starts to lose his composure

SARA
3rd grade when Ricky was on crutches for
a month Who carried his books every day
Or when you were 10 and Rosemary Clark
lost her mother You invited her to live
with us said I’d be her new mom
Remember that You’ve always been so
special Sutter That’s why everyone
loves you

SUTTER
Nobody loves me Mom

SARA
You’re wrong Sutter

And now Mom is crying too Holds him tighter

SARA
You hear me You’re so very wrong

And finally Sutter hugs back He closes his eyes as they
hold each other Over her shoulder we see him crumble
the slip of paper in his hand
