In a line of people queueing in front of a counter we see
Mortimer Brewster with a hat and a pair of large dark glasses He
turns around and notices the two journalists looking at him He
raises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face The
girl in front of him turns around to look at him She has blonde
curly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather She is
Elaine Harper With both his hands Mortimer turns her face back
toward the counter

Back to the two journalists at the door of the room

The two journalists are straining their own ears to be able to
understand Mortimers name

THE CLERK
Hows that

Mortimer raises his glasses but still whispers

MORTIMER

THE CLERK

Mortimer bends down putting his chin at the counter level Then

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY

Still dragging Elaine Mortimer runs in the corridor
THE OTHER JOURNALIST
(voice over)
Mister Brewster

Mortimer pushes Elaine into a telephone booth and enters behind
her There is already a man in the booth who is using the phone
With three people in the booth Mortimer can hardly close the door
behind him

The two journalists runs in the corridor

THE OTHER JOURNALIST
Oh Mister Brewster

But they pass the booth without noticing that Mortimer is inside

In the booth the man still holding the phone receiver tries to
protest the intrusion

THE MAN ON THE PHONE
Now look
Mortimer takes the receiver from him and speaks into it

MORTIMER
Goodbye dear

He hangs up the receiver and then pushes violently the man
outside the booth The man looks very angry but doesnt try to
come back in the booth

In the booth a very exciter Mortimer is talking to Elaine

MORTIMER

of bachelorhood Ive sneered at every love scene in every
play Ive written four million words against marriage

He taps on a pin on the lapel of Elaines jacket

ELAINE

surprised and gives him a forced smile showing his teeth

BROOKLYN - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT - EXTERIOR DAY

We see a street in Brooklyn in front of nice house Written on
the screen in large white letters
And now back to
one of Brooklyns most
charming residential
districts--

BROOKLYN - CHURCHYARD - EXTERIOR DAY

A churchyard with a close-up on a tombstone «Jacob John
Vendemeer died 1654» Written on the screen in large white
letters

--From her in youre
on your own

We see the gate of the churchyard with a plate that says «This
cemetery was established in april 1654»

Along this gate two cops are doing their beat The older one
Sargent Brophy is talking to the younger one Officer Patrick
OHara

BROPHY

OHara dont be a jerk You dont seem to realize Im
turning over to you the nicest the best beat in Brooklyn
Now look at that old church And them old houses

OHARA

Did George Washington ever do any sleeping around here

BROPHY
Of course he did Well this whole neighborhood just stinks
with atmosphere And look at that old house there

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Walking their beat the two cops have come outside the Brewster
sisters residence

OHARA
Are the original owners still over there

BROPHY
Now dont crack wise about the Brewster sisters Theyre
two of the dearest sweetest kindest old ladies that ever
walked the earth Theyre out of this world Theyre
like theyre like pressed rose leaves
They have come near a police call box Brophy takes a key out of
his pocket to open the box

OHARA
Pressed rose leaves

In front of the house there is a «Room for Rent» sign While
Brophy picks up the phone in the call box OHara looks at the
sign

OHARA
The old girls must be kind of hard up huh

BROPHY
No no Their old man left them fixed for life And dont
you call them «the girls» either

Brophy starts talking in the receiver of the call box

BROPHY
Brophy Is Lieutenant around

OHARA
Then so why here do they rent a room for

BROPHY

They dont rent rooms But you can bet if anybody came
looking for a room they wouldnt go away without a good
meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets
Thats just their way of digging up people to do good to

We get a closer view of the front of the house A large
rectangular stone with «Brewster» engraved on it A group of
children runs in front of the house

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

In the forefront of the room Teddy Brewster is playing Mozarts
Turkish March on the harpsichord He looks a bit like late
President Theodore Roosevelt And he is dressed like the President
was dressed on the official pictures weve got of him And like
the President he is wearing a pince-nez

In another corner of the room Abby Brewster is having tea with
Reverend Harper Elaines father She looks like an old English
lady a bit like Agatha Christies Miss Marple

ABBY

Reverend Harper I do hope you dont disapprove of Mortimer
just because hes a dramatic critic and takes your daughter
to the theater every night

REVEREND HARPER

Its not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic
but no man no man with this published attitude on
marriage

Close-up on the book Reverend Harper just took on the table
«Marriage a Fraud and a Failure by Mortimer Brewster»
REVEREND HARPER
should take any mans daughter anyplace

He sneezes

REVEREND HARPER
at any time

He sneezes again louder this time Teddy stops playing and there
is a puzzled look in his eyes

TEDDY
I must be catching cold

ABBY

(to Teddy)

No dear It was Reverend Harper who sneezed
(to Reverend Harper)

Bless you

Teddy puts back in his pocket the handkerchief he had taken out
and starts playing again

ABBY
We mustnt be angry with Mortimer Hes so very much in
love with her And Sister Martha and I are so happy about

it He used to come to see us only occasionally and now
now hes in Brooklyn six nights a week

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

The two cops Brophy and OHara are mounting the steps to the
Brewster sisters house

BROPHY
Remember now watch your language

OHARA
Besides you know Im not a swearing man

BROPHY
Youd be surprised what theyd consider swearing

He rings the doorbell
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
At the sound of the doorbell Teddy stops playing

ABBY
Oh will you excuse me
She gets up from her armchair

ABBY
No no Teddy dear Thank you Ill go

She goes to the door and opens it

ABBY
Oh come right in Mr Brophy

The two cops get in

BROPHY

ABBY
Oh yes

OHara closes the door

BROPHY
This is Officer OHara Hes taking over my beat

OHARA

ABBY
May I welcome you to our neighborhood Mister OHara

Teddy with his teacup in hand joins the group He speaks with a
very serious expression on his face

TEDDY
Gentlemen what news have you brought me

Brophy salutes him and stands at attention

BROPHY
Colonel we have nothing to report

Teddy gives an intrigued look to OHara who doesnt seem to
understand Brophy elbows him with the arm which is still
saluting

OHARA
Huh
He eventually understands what his Sargent is trying to tell him

OHARA
Oh no absolutely nothing to report

He salutes but with a less official attitude than his Sargent
Teddy smiles

TEDDY

Splendid Thank you gentlemen
(very serious again)

At ease

Brophy puts his arm down OHara looks at his Sargent with a
perplexed expression and takes longer to put his arm down

ABBY

You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next
door

BROPHY

Hello Reverend This is Officer OHara the new man on the
beat

Teddy looks at OHara with a puzzled expression

OHARA
How do you do sir Its nice to meet you

OHara looks ill at ease under Teddys stare

ABBY
The toys are on the chair up here by the library door

OHara moves toward the pile of toys Teddys eyes are following
him with the same puzzled expression OHara feels less and less
at ease

ABBY

Oh Teddy will you run upstairs and bring down your Army
and Navy from Aunt Marthas room Theyre all packed

REVEREND HARPER
Thats splendid work you men do fixing up discarded toys
for the kids at camp

Teddy who has started to mount the stairs to the upper level
stops in his stride pretends he is taking a sword out of a sheath
at his side points this imaginary sword in front of him and
starts running up the stairs yelling

TEDDY
Charge

When he arrives on the balcony on which open the bedroom doors
he rushes into his room and slams the door

While Bophy and Reverend Harper remain unmoved OHara who is
standing by the grandfathers clock jumps and looks at the clock
which chimes once The minute hand of the clock falls down to the
half-hour position OHara is very disturbed and points his stick
to his Sargent who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and
laughs with Reverend Harper and Abby

BROPHY
It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the
station You get tired of playing cards

Abby moves away from them to the grandfathers clock She puts the
minute hand back into its original position Brophy and Reverend
Harper joins her by the clock

BROPHY
So these are the toys

OHara picks up the box in which the toys are stocked

ABBY
Hows Missis Brophy

BROPHY
Oh shes better thank you But a little weak still

ABBY
Well Ill better get some beef broth for you to take to
her

BROPHY
Oh Miss Abby please dont bother Youve done so much
already

ABBY
Oh Stuff and nonsense I wont be a minute

She moves away and exits into the kitchen

REVEREND HARPER

Gentlemen if I know what pure kindness and absolute
generosity are its because Ive known the Brewster
sisters

On the balcony Teddy gets out of his room with a bugle and
starts playing it very loudly OHara jumps and drops the box with
the toys on the floor Reverend Harper and Brophy seem to be less
moved by the event

Brophy stands back and points his finger up to Teddy

BROPHY
Oh Teddy you promised me you wouldnt do that anymore
Teddy

still standing on the balcony answers him leaning on the

balustrade

TEDDY

But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of
those supplies

BROPHY
Now dont do that again Do you hear me

Teddy goes back into his room slamming the door behind him The
grandfathers clock chimes once and the minute hand falls back to
the half-hour position OHara jumps and looks at the clock

BROPHY

He used to do that in the middle of the night and
neighbors raised Cain with me Theyre a little afraid of
him anyway

OHARA
Look Sarge I promised you I wouldnt swear but what the
heck

He stops in the middle of his sentence gives a quick look to
Reverend Harper and corrects himself

OHara

OHARA
Whats going on here anyway

REVEREND HARPER
Oh hes quite harmless

BROPHY
He thinks hes Teddy Roosevelt So what theres a lot of
worse guys he could think he was

OHARA
Huh

gives a quick look toward the upper landing and then nods

OHARA
Thats right Ill make a note of it Hes a very
interesting character

BROPHY
Isnt it a shame Father isnt it a shame Reverend that
a nice family like this should be hatching a cuckoo

The front door opens and Martha Brewster comes in Like her

sister

she looks like an old English lady She is wearing a short
cape and a hat and she carries a cylindrical can with a handle
She closes the door

MARTHA
Oh well now isnt this nice

She goes to Brophy and the Reverend

Teddy is getting down the stairs carrying a box full of toys
under his arm He stops a few steps from floor level

TEDDY
The Army and Navy are ready for action

He resumes his walking down the stairs

BROPHY
Oh Colonel this is grand Itll make a lot of kids happy

Brophy takes the box from Teddy Teddy looks into the box OHara
is carrying and takes a model warship out of the box

TEDDY

puzzled eyes

TEDDY

ABBY

Brophy moves toward the front door OHara follows him still
looking at Teddy Teddy doesnt seem to like the way he looks at
him and moves the toy ship away from him

BROPHY
The children will go crazy

He has reached the front door Abby has moved near the door ready
to open it for him

ABBY
Oh now dont mention it
OHara salutes Teddy

OHARA
Well So long Colonel

Teddy looks at him and then looks at Brophy who doesnt salute
him OHara elbows his Sargent with the arm which is saluting

OHARA
Hey Sarge

BROPHY

Brophy looks at Teddy and understands the situation He also
salutes Teddy

BROPHY
Oh yes

Teddy salutes them

TEDDY
Dismissed

Brophy and OHara bring their arms down

BROPHY
Well goodbye and thank you
ABBY

Good bye

Abby opens the front door The two cops start going out Brophy
first

ABBY
Careful of the step here now with the toys

BROPHY
Good night

OHara goes out and then comes one step back and shows his face
behind the door He winks to Teddy Teddy raises his eyebrows

TEDDY
Young man let that be a lesson to you

OHara chuckles then makes a strange face and goes out

ABBY
Goodbye
She closes the door and goes back to her sister and Reverend
Harper

ABBY
Well

REVEREND HARPER
Well I must be going

Teddy still carrying his model warship starts mounting the
stairs stops after a few steps takes his imaginary sword out
points it forward and runs upstairs yelling

TEDDY
Charge

He reaches the balcony turns toward the balustrade and yells

TEDDY
Charge the blockhouse

He goes into his room and slams the door behind him We hear the
grandfathers clock chiming once

Reverend Harper looks up at the balcony then turns to the
Brewster sisters with puzzled eyes

REVEREND HARPER
Blockhouse

MARTHA
Oh the stairs are always San Juan Hill

REVEREND HARPER
Oh I

But Reverend Harper doesnt finish his sentence and sneezes very
loudly He takes his handkerchief out of his pocket to put it
under his nose

ABBY
Bless you

REVEREND HARPER

Have you ever tried to persuade him he wasnt Teddy
Roosevelt

ABBY
Oh no

She goes to the grandfathers clock
MARTHA
Oh hes so happy being Teddy Roosevelt

Abby moves the minute hand of the clock back in place

ABBY
Oh do you remember Martha
She comes back to her sister and Reverend Harper

ABBY

Once a long time ago we thought if hed be George
Washington it might be a change for him and we suggested
it

MARTHA

And do you know what happened He just stayed under his
bed for days and wouldnt be anybody

Reverend Harper laughs

REVEREND HARPER
Well if hes happy and whats more important youre

He starts walking toward the front door followed by the Brewster
sisters He reaches the door and opens it

MARTHA
Oh our only worry for Teddy is after we are gone

They all go out

toward his own house
ABBY

Martha looks around in the room then looks at her sister with
questioning eyes

MARTHA

ABBY
Martha just look in the window-seat

She points to the large chest-bench under the window Martha seems
delighted and both sisters go to the window-seat They bend down
to raise the lid of the seat when someone taps on the window
above the seat The two sisters stand up and move the curtains
revealing Elaines face

ABBY
Oh Its Elaine

Elaine raises the window and kisses the two sisters

ELAINE
You darlings
She winks at them and then runs away

MARTHA
But Elaine
ABBY

What did she mean You dont suppose theyve gone and
Martha puts her hand over her mouth
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

A taxi cab has stopped in front of the Brewster sisters house The
driver is half inside the back of his car apparently looking for
something Mortimer is already out of the cab He is whistling He
raises his hand and yells

MORTIMER
Elaine

Elaine is crossing the churchyard to go to her fathers house She
stops and turns around to look at Mortimer

On one of the tombstones is engraved the name «Amanda Brewster»
and the dates «1813-1863»

The Brewster sisters who were bending out of their window to get
a better view of the scene are coming back in looking extremely
happy

The cab driver gives his coat to Mortimer

CAB DRIVER
Listen buddy This old cab has seen osculation but

He whistles and goes back inside the back of the car to look for
other missing items

MORTIMER

their window

He starts chasing her again

Behind their curtain the two sisters are still peeking They
laugh and then slightly move the curtains open a few inches to
have a better look

Back to the tree The couple is hidden by the tree They separate
and move a little away from each other each one of them appearing
on either side the tree

Elaine drags Mortimer by the hand from behind the tree
ELAINE
But Mortimer youre going to love me for my mind too

MORTIMER
One thing at a time

She starts running away from him

ELAINE

Mortimer comes slowly from behind the tree clowning

MORTIMER
«Theres that look again Mortimer » You better get used

Abby turns to go searching and Mortimer pats her behind

MORTIMER
Come on come on Lets go

Abby turns back to him

ABBY
Now you behave
She goes away on her search

MORTIMER
Lets find them before Elaine sees them

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony He is dressed in full
colonial costume complete with pith helmet He is carrying a
shovel and his bugle is stuck in his belt He walks rapidly down
the stairs

He stops a few steps from the ground floor when he spots
Mortimer He seems very happy to see him

TEDDY
Hello Mortimer

MORTIMER

TEDDY

me

Teddy takes off his pince-nez

MORTIMER

TEDDY

He puts his pince-nez back on his nose and shakes hands again
with Mortimer

TEDDY
Well goodbye Im off to Panama

Teddy walks to the cellar door Mortimer bends slightly

MORTIMER
Goodbye Mister President

Before he opens the door Teddy turns to Mortimer

TEDDY
A new lock for the canal you know

He opens the door and starts walking down the steps to the
cellar Before the door closes back we can hear him singing

TEDDY
«Oh tell the news to Mother»

Abby is still looking for Mortimers note and in a drawer she
finds a piece of paper that seems to annoy her
ABBY
Oh dear

MORTIMER
Did you find those notes

Mortimer senses there is something wrong in his aunts voice and
walks to her

MORTIMER
Whats the matter

She holds the paper for Mortimer to take it

ABBY
Theres a baby picture of your brother Jonathan

Mortimer takes the picture and looks at it

INSERT - Close-up of the picture It shows a very ugly child with
a very strange face

MORTIMER

You ought to put that in the fire with my books My what a
face

He gives the picture back to Abby

MORTIMER
I remember now He used to scare grownups with it

Mortimer walks away from his aunt

ABBY

Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me Do you remember
how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth

Mortimer is searching on the small telephone desk
MORTIMER

Oh Jonathan Oh hes probably in prison or hanged or
something by now

He walks across the room and starts searching on the table

MORTIMER

I saw a play which had a character in it Reminded me of
Jonathan

ABBY
No Really
While talking they both keep on searching everywhere in the room

MORTIMER
Yeah Oh a honey of a lunatic One of those whodunits
called «Murder Will Out»

ABBY
Oh dear
Abby goes into the kitchen

MORTIMER
Yeah what a play When the curtain goes up the first
thing you see is a dead body

While talking he keeps on searching and opens the lid of the
window-seat He gives its insides a quick look and closes it back
and then moves away

MORTIMER
The next thing

He stops in his tracks and looks back at the window-seat He jumps
back to it opens the lid and closes it very quickly He then sits
on the seat with a frightened look on his face Slowly he kneels
down on the floor and opens the lid again but very slowly He
talks to whatever or whomever is in the seat

MORTIMER

Hey mister
He remains a few seconds seated of the seat with a very puzzled
face

We hear Elaine whistling Mortimer tries to whistle back but no
sound comes from his mouth He tries again but with no more
success He seems in shock

He looks at the kitchen then at the seat There is horror on his
face

His two aunts come from the kitchen singing and carrying things
for the celebration

Mortimer shows a forced smile

The two sisters puts things on the table then they come to
Mortimer who is still seated on the window-seat Abby is carrying
a big bowl of rice and the two girls start throwing rice on him

ABBY
Happy bridegroom

MARTHA
Congratulations darling

MORTIMER
Never mind that now I know

Mortimer takes the bowl from Abbys hands and put it on a small
table He remains seated while his aunts are standing in front of
him

MORTIMER

Now listen darlings Aunt Abby Aunt Martha you know how
weve always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium
Happy Dale

ABBY
Oh yes dear Thats after were gone

They move away to start setting the table

ABBY
Yes we talked with Reverend Harper about it

MORTIMER
No no Teddys got to go to Happy Dale now At once Now
hes down in the cellar Get him up here right away

MARTHA
But theres no such hurry as yet you know

ABBY

No When Teddys working on the canal you cant get his
mind on anything else

Mortimer stands up and comes to the table where his aunts are
working

MORTIMER
Well look darlings Look Im frightfully sorry but Ive
got an awful shock for you

He takes Abbys hands in his

MORTIMER
Teddys killed a man darlings

Martha laughs

MARTHA
Nonsense

MORTIMER
(he yells)
But theres a body in the window-seat

ABBY
Yes dear We know

Mortimer looks even more shocked than before His two aunts keep
on setting the table as if nothing had happened

MORTIMER
You know

MARTHA
Of course

ABBY
Yes but it has nothing to do with Teddy

Mortimer wants to speak but Abby stops him

ABBY

Now Mortimer You just forget about it Forget you ever
saw the gentleman

MORTIMER

Forget

ABBY
We never dreamed youd peek

MORTIMER
What the Who is he

ABBY
Hes a Mister Hoskins Adam Hoskins Thats really all I
know about him except that hes a Methodist

MARTHA
Oh Hes a Methodist Isnt that nice

MORTIMER

Thats all you know But whats he doing here What
happened to him

Mortimer is more and more shocked and his aunts very calmly keep
on putting plates and silverware on the table

MARTHA

He died

MORTIMER
Look Aunt Martha men just dont get into window-seats and

die

ABBY
No dear He died first

Mortimer takes his aunts hands to stop them from setting the
table

MORTIMER
Oh well now wait Stop all this

He takes Abbys hands in his

MORTIMER
Now look darlings how did he die

ABBY
Oh Mortimer dont be so inquisitive The gentleman died
because he drank some wine with poison in it

MORTIMER
But how did the poison get in the wine

MARTHA

Well we put it in wine because its less noticeable
When its in tea it has a distinct odor

MORTIMER

You mean you

(yelling)

You put it in the wine

ABBY

Yes And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat because
Reverend Harper was coming

Mortimer seems ready to faint

MORTIMER
Ohh Look at me darling

He takes again Abbys hands in his

MORTIMER
You mean you mean you knew what youd done and you didnt
want the Reverend Harper to see the body

ABBY
Well not at tea That wouldnt have been very nice

Abby goes back table-setting and Mortimer holds himself on the
edge of the table

MORTIMER
Ohh Its first-degree
ABBY

Now Mortimer you know all about it and just forget about
it I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own
little secrets

Martha walks to the kitchen door but she stops and turns around

MARTHA

Oh Abby while I was out I dropped in on Missis Schultz
Shes much better But she wants us to take Junior to the
movies again

ABBY
Well we must do that tomorrow or next day

MARTHA

Yes but this time well go where we want to go Juniors
not going to drag me into another one of those scary
pictures

The two sisters enter the kitchen

ABBY

No they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures
just to frighten people

Mortimer remains alone in the room He has the face of someone who
thinks he is having a nightmare and hopes to wake up soon

He goes to the telephone desk picks up the phone and dials «0»

MORTIMER
Operator Can you hear my voice You can
Are you sure

He puts the phone down
MORTIMER
Then I must be here

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Elaine is appearing of her room in her fathers house She has got
her purse and her gloves She plays with a large artificial
flower She whistles

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer half-seated on the telephone desk comes out of his
dream and goes to the window By signs only he tries to explain
to Elaine that hes got a problem with the window-seat We dont
see her but we imagine she doesnt understand because Mortimer
rushes to the kitchen
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer rushes into the kitchen
MORTIMER

Aunt Abby Aunt Martha

He stops abruptly A group of costumed and masked children are
gathered behind the window Martha is distributing watermelons
pumpkins and pies to them The children are saying
incomprehensible words of thanking

Martha closes the window on them and switches on the lights

ABBY
Oh the dears Isnt Halloween a wonderful time for them

MARTHA
Yes it is They have so much fun

They both go back to their cooking work in the kitchen Martha is
preparing some kind of desert in a bowl

MARTHA

MORTIMER

Mortimer paces the kitchen while his aunts are busy cooking

ABBY
Yes You just should get stop worrying about it

MARTHA
We told you to forget the whole thing
MORTIMER

(yelling)

Forget Look my dear aunt Martha cant I make you
realize that something has to be done

Abby leaves the stove where she was working and comes to the
table

ABBY

Now Mortimer you behave Youre too old to be flying off
the handle like this

MORTIMER

But but Mister Hodgekiss

ABBY
Hoskins dear

MORTIMER
But whatever his name is you cant leave him in there

MARTHA

Mortimer looks very shocked

MORTIMER

Oh you mean youre going to bury Mister Hodgekiss in the
cellar

MARTHA
Oh yes dear Thats what we did with the others

MORTIMER

He comes close to the table where Martha is working And all of a
sudden he seems to realize what she just said

MORTIMER
Others

MARTHA
The other gentlemen

MORTIMER
Oh When you say «others» do you mean «others» More

than one «others»

Martha laughs
MARTHA

Oh yes dear Let me see now This is eleven isnt it
Abby

ABBY
Oh no dear This makes twelve

MARTHA
Abby dear I think youre wrong This one is only eleven

ABBY

No dear because I remember when Mister Hoskins first came
in it occurred to me that hed make just an even dozen

Mortimer seems completely dejected and he sits down not even
listening to his aunts anymore

MARTHA

But look Abby dear I really dont think you should count
the first one

ABBY
Oh I was counting the first one and that makes it twelve

MARTHA
It does

Abby who is sucking her finger nods to answer

MARTHA

Well shes probably right Abby usually is I get them
mixed up sometimes

MORTIMER
Makes it twelve Well

The telephone rings Mortimer puts his hand to his ear

MORTIMER
Hello

He suddenly realizes that he doesnt have a telephone in his hand

MORTIMER
Oh

He rushes out of the kitchen

ABBY
Well whatever is the matter with Mortimer today
MARTHA
Why Abby what do you think happened to him

They walk out of the kitchen
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer sits at the telephone desk and picks up the phone

MORTIMER
Hello

We hear some whistling coming from the telephone Mortimer takes
the receiver a bit away from his ear surprised Then he takes it
back

MORTIMER
Not now Not now For heavens sake keep your shirt on

He slams the phone down on his hook Then he realizes he has been
rude and picks it up again

MORTIMER
Oh Oh Elaine I didnt mean

He realizes there is no one on the phone and puts it back down
MORTIMER
Now lets see Where were we Twelve
(he yells)
Twelve

He jumps from his chair and rushes toward the kitchen But when
he sees his two aunts setting the table he stops and goes to
them

MARTHA
Yes dear Abby thinks we should count the first one

MORTIMER
Never mind about that Just sit down

Martha sits down

MORTIMER
Now tell me who was the first one

ABBY
Mister Midgely He was a Baptist

MARTHA
He was such a lonely old gentleman Mister Midgely was

ABBY
All his kith and kin were dead

MARTHA
We felt so sorry for him

ABBY

And then when his heart attack came and he sat there dead
in that chair looking so peaceful Remember Martha We
made up our minds then and there that if we could help

other lonely old men to find that same peace we would
MORTIMER

Why you poor You mean he dropped dead right in this
chair

Mortimer realizes its the chair hes sitting on and stands up
very quickly

ABBY

And then you see Teddy came up from digging in Panama
and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim
And that meant he had to be buried immediately

MORTIMER
So

MARTHA

So we all took him down to Panama and put him in the lock
and gave him a decent Christian burial There now you
see
(she stands up)
Thats why we told you not to bother about it because we
know exactly whats to be done
Mortimer is sitting on the table and seems not to know what he
must do next But he suddenly stands up

MORTIMER
Wait a minute

He rushes to his aunts

MORTIMER

Come here darlings What about the others All twelve of
them didnt walk in here and drop dead

ABBY
Oh no dear Of course not

MORTIMER
Well so so

Abby whispers something in Marthas ear Martha looks at Mortimer
smiles and whispers back in her sisters ear
MARTHA
Mortimer

MORTIMER

MARTHA
Do you remember those jars of poison that were on the
shelves in Grandfathers laboratory all these years

ABBY
You know your Aunt Marthas knack for mixing things

MARTHA

teaspoonful of arsenic then add half a teaspoonful of
strychnine And then just a pinch of cyanide

to say «How delicious »

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The cab driver is pacing back and forth on the sidewalk near his
taxi

Mortimer comes running out of the house The driver goes toward
him

CAB DRIVER
Do you still want me to wait here

MORTIMER
Yes Call me a cab

CAB DRIVER
Yeah Okay okay

They run together and stop in front of the parked taxi The driver
waves his arm

CAB DRIVER
Hey cab Here you are

Another taxi stops near the first one The driver wants to open
the back door for Mortimer

MORTIMER
Dont open it Ill sit with you

CAB DRIVER
Yeah thats right I can go faster that way Sure

Mortimer climbs in the front of the taxi next to the driver The
taxi drives away and the first driver remains on the street
touching his cap

CAB DRIVER
Wait a minute What am I doing Hey

He pats his own taxi points his finger to it and waves for the
other taxi to come back

CAB DRIVER
Come here

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Abby picks up Mr Hoskins hat She brushes it with her hand and
gives it to Martha

ABBY
Fancy getting nice Mr Hoskins hat all mussed up

MARTHA

Shame Such a nice hat
She crosses the room and takes a brush on a cupboard near the
window-seat and starts brushing the hat

MARTHA
You know Abby Mortimer didnt seem to be quite himself
today

Abby brings two candlesticks on the table

ABBY
No Oh well

Martha opens the cupboard which is full of mans hats She puts
Hoskins hat with the others and then closes the cupboard

MARTHA
Well what were you saying about Mortimer

Abby has lit the candles

ABBY
Oh I think I understand why he seemed so upset

MARTHA
Why

ABBY

Hes just been married I believe that always makes a man a
little nervous

MARTHA
Oh yes The poor dears

She crosses the room to the door to switch off the lights

MARTHA

Im so happy for Elaine Oh Abby If Mortimers coming
back for the services for Mr Hoskins were going to need
another hymnal Theres one up in my room

Knocks at the front door Through the frosted window-panels of the
door we see the shadows of two men

ABBY
Oh Ill go dear

MARTHA
Abby we promised Mortimer we wouldnt let anyone come in

More knocks at the door Martha peeks through the drapes of a
convenient window a few steps above floor-level on the staircase

MARTHA
Abby Two men and Ive never seen them before

ABBY
Are you sure

MARTHA

Yes

ABBY

Let me look

Abby climbs the steps and comes near her sister to peek through
the drapes

MARTHA
You look

The two shadows knock again

MARTHA
Do you recognize them

ABBY
No theyre strangers to me
MARTHA
Well well just have to pretend were not at home

The front door opens The tallest of the two men dressed in black
and wearing a large hat comes in first The other one shorter
and hatless follows him

We get a close-up of the face of the tall man actually Jonathan
Brewster Its full of scars and it makes him look a bit like
Boris Karloff in the Frankenstein films He looks around the room

JONATHAN
Come in doctor

Doctor Einstein who was waiting at the door comes into the room
and closes the door behind him

JONATHAN

This is the home of my youth As a boy I couldnt wait to
escape from this house Now Im glad to escape back into
it

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yes Johnny its a good hideout

He takes a small bottle from an inside pocket of his jacket and
takes a sip at it

JONATHAN
The family must still live here I hope theres a fatted
calf awaiting the return of the prodigal

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
A fatted calf Oh Johnny Im so hungry

He comes closer to the table

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Look Johnny Drink

JONATHAN

As if we were expected
DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes

JONATHAN
A good omen

Einstein pours some wine from the carafe in a glass Jonathan
takes a glass already full on the table
Abby gets down the few steps followed by Martha

ABBY
Who are you What are you doing here

The two men put their glasses down on the table

JONATHAN
Aunt Abby Aunt Martha Its Jonathan

MARTHA
You you get out of here

JONATHAN
Im Jonathan you know Your nephew Jonathan

He takes his hat off

ABBY
Oh no youre not Youre nothing like Jonathan so dont
pretend you are You just get out of here

She points to the door

JONATHAN

I see youre still wearing the lovely garnet ring that
Grandma Brewster bought in England And you Aunt Martha
still the high collar to hide the scar where Grandfathers
acid burned you

MARTHA
Why his voice is like Jonathans

ABBY
Have have you been in an accident

JONATHAN
My face Doctor Einstein is responsible for that Hes a
plastic surgeon

MARTHA

But Ive seen that face before Do you remember when we
took the little Schultz boy to the movies and I was so
frightened It was that face

Jonathan turns around and look harshly at Einstein who seems a
bit uneasy

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Take it easy Johnny Take it easy Dont worry The last
five years I give him three different faces I give him
another one right away That last face I saw that picture

too just before I operated I was intoxicated
Jonathan grabs Einsteins collar and squeezes it

JONATHAN
You see doctor what youve done to me Even my own
family think Im

Einstein has breathing problems because of Jonathans squeezing

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Johnny Johnny You are home in this lovely house

Jonathan lets go of Einstein who walks toward the two sisters

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You know how many times he tells me about about
Brooklyn about this house and about his aunts he loves so
much They know you Johnny Please tell him so

ABBY
Well Jonathan its been a long time

Jonathan sits down

JONATHAN
Bless you Its good to be home again

Abby turns toward Martha and then goes down the few last steps to
floor level

ABBY
Well Martha we mustnt let whats on the stove boil over

She picks up the glasses on the table
ABBY
If youll excuse us for a moment Jonathan Unless youre
in a hurry to go somewhere

She goes to the kitchen with the glasses Martha picks up the wine
carafe to the disappointment of Dr Einstein and follows her
sister toward the kitchen Before entering the kitchen she puts
the carafe back on the shelf where it was before She then closes
the kitchen door after her

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Well Johnny where do we go from here You know Johnny
we got to think fast

Close-up on the hands of Jonathan playing with a metallic brain-
teaser
DOCTOR EINSTEIN
The police they got pictures of that face I got to
operate on you right away We got to find someplace We got
to find someplace for Mister Spenalzo too

While talking he has taken another sip from his bottle

JONATHAN
Dont waste any worry on that rat

Einstein stands up

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
But we got a hot stiff on our hands

JONATHAN
Forget Mr Spenalzo

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But Johnny we cant leave a dead body in the rumble seat
You shouldnt have killed him Just because he knows
something about us what happens

Einstein mimes the breaking of a neck with his hands

JONATHAN

We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down
Besides he said I looked like Boris Karloff Thats your
work doctor You did that to me

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
No please Johnny take it easy Well find some place
and Ill fix you up right away

JONATHAN
Tonight

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yes tonight but I have to eat first

The two sisters are peeking in the room through a small
rectangular hole in the door of the kitchen

JONATHAN

This time I want the face of an absolute nonentity

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yes Johnny I know exactly what Im going to do

He comes close to Jonathan and shows him on his face what he is
going to do to it

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
You see Im going to take this piece here and lift it
up

JONATHAN
Be careful about the stitches this time

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
You leave that up to me Ill give you nice little ears
and

JONATHAN

You were careless last time

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

And new stitches And on the eyes Ill do a Schmidt Thats
my specialty You see I take it together like this

JONATHAN
Leave the eyes alone Leave the nose alone

The scene dissolves to
JUDGE CULLMANS OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

The judge is sitting studying some papers Mortimer is standing
at his side

JUDGE CULLMAN
Poor Teddy I imagine its for the best

He drops the papers on the desk and starts declaiming

JUDGE CULLMAN
Well «Ours not to reason why ours but to do»

Mortimer is very irritated by the Judges erratic attitude He
puts a pen in his hand

MORTIMER

JUDGE CULLMAN

state

Mortimer takes the pen from the Judges hand and starts signing
the papers

MORTIMER

JUDGE CULLMAN

He goes out slamming the door behind him The Judge looks
pensively at the door Mortimer just closed

JUDGE CULLMAN
I may be committing the wrong Brewster

The scene dissolves to
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The Brewster sister are sitting at the table with Doctor Einstein
and Jonathan The dinner is finished and both men are smoking
ABBY
Well Im sure you both want to get to wherever youre
going

The two sisters stands up from the table

JONATHAN
My dear sweet aunties Im so full of your delicious
dinner Im unable to move a muscle

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yes its nice here

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony He is still wearing
his colonial costume He has a book in his hand and a spare pith
helmet under his arm He rushes down the stairs

TEDDY
I found it I found it

He stops suddenly in the staircase

TEDDY

Gentlemen be seated
Jonathan and Einstein pretend they are standing up but they
immediately sit back in their chairs

Teddy comes down the last steps and goes toward the table

TEDDY
Here it is gentlemen The story of my life my biography

He puts the book on the table in front of Einstein Its open on
a page with a picture

TEDDY

Heres the picture I was telling you about General Here
we are both of us President Roosevelt and General
Goethals at Culebra Cut Thats me General and thats
you

Einstein looks at the picture

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
My how Ive changed

TEDDY

Well you see that picture hasnt been taken yet We
havent even started work on Culebra Cut Were still
digging locks And now General we will both go to Panama
and inspect the new lock
He gives the spare helmet to Einstein

ABBY
No Teddy Not to Panama

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Oh maybe some other time Mister President Panama is a

long ways off
TEDDY

Nonsense Its just down in the cellar

Jonathan who hadnt seemed to be much interested by Teddys
conversation suddenly looks up

JONATHAN
The cellar

MARTHA
Well we let him dig the Panama Canal in the cellar

TEDDY
General Goethals

Einstein slightly raises the hand holding the cigarette to his

forehead

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yes sir

TEDDY

As President of the United States Commander in Chief of

the Army and Navy and the man who gave you this job

demand that you accompany me on the inspection of the new

lock

JONATHAN
Teddy I think its time for you to go to bed

TEDDY
beg your pardon Who are you

JONATHAN
m Woodrow Wilson Go to bed

TEDDY

No youre not Wilson But your face is familiar Let me
see Youre not anyone I know now Perhaps later on my
hunting trip to Africa Yes you look like someone I might

meet in the jungle

Jonathan starts standing up with a very menacing face
ABBY
I think perhaps you had better go to bed Teddy He and
his friend want to get back to their hotel

Jonathan sits back in his chair

JONATHAN
General Goethals inspect the canal

Einstein stands up and takes his helmet

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
All right Mister President we go to Panama

TEDDY

Bully bully Follow me General
He opens the door to the cellar then turns toward Einstein taps
on the helmet Einstein is carrying and then on his own helmet

TEDDY
Its down south you know

Einstein puts the helmet on his head The helmet is too large for
him and gets down on his eyes

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Oh

Teddy starts going downstairs Before following him Einstein
turns around to the others

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Well bon voyage

He waves them goodbye and then follows Teddy downstairs

Jonathan has remained seated with both his aunts standing on the
other side of the table

JONATHAN
Aunt Abby I must correct your misapprehension You talked
of our hotel We have no hotel We came here directly

ABBY
This is not your home and Im afraid you cant stay here

Jonathan stands up and looks menacingly at his aunts While
talking he moves closer to them They look frightened

JONATHAN
Doctor Einstein and I need a place to sleep You remember
that as a boy I could be disagreeable It would not be
pleasant for any of us if but I dont have to go into
details do I

MARTHA
Perhaps wed better let them stay here tonight

Einstein appears at the door of the cellar

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Hey Johnny Johnny Come here Quick

He goes back down the stairs to the cellar

JONATHAN

Oh I forgot to tell you Doctor Einstein and I are turning
Grandfathers laboratory into an operating room We expect
to be very busy

He goes to the cellar door
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Einstein is on the staircase halfway down to the cellar On the
wall behind him we see the shadow of Teddy digging

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Hey Johnny down here what do you think I find

He takes off his helmet Jonathan joins him on the stairs

JONATHAN
What

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

The Panama Canal And it just fits Mister Spenalzo See the
hole hes digging Four feet wide six feet long He just
fits Youd think he knew we were bringing Mister Spenalzo
along Thats hospitality

Jonathan smiles and looks upstairs

JONATHAN
Rather a good joke on my aunts Theyre living in a house
with a body buried in the cellar

Einstein laughs

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Hey how do we get him in here

JONATHAN
Yes we cant just walk Mister Spenalzo in through the
door Well bring the car up between the cemetery and the
house and after theyve gone to bed well bring Mister
Spenalzo in through the window

He goes back up the stairs Einstein follows him The shadow of
Teddy keeps on digging

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Hey Johnny

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Jonathan comes in through the cellar door with Einstein following
behind him His two aunts are still standing up in the room

JONATHAN
Were moving the car behind the house Youd better get to
bed

He crosses the room with Einstein following him

MARTHA
The car is all right where it is until morning

JONATHAN
I dont want to leave it in the street That might be
against the law

He opens the front door and gets out still followed by Einstein

MARTHA
Abby What are we going to do

ABBY

Well were not going to let them spend more than one night
in this house for one thing But what would the neighbors
think People coming in here with one face and going out
with another

MARTHA
And what are we going to do about Mister Hoskins

ABBY

Oh Mister Hoskins It cant be very comfortable for him

in there And hes been so patient the poor dear Well I

think Teddy had better take Mister Hoskins downstairs right
away

Teddy enters by the cellar door

TEDDY
General Goethals was very pleased He said the canal was
just the right size
From the table he picks up the book he had shown to Dr Einstein
and starts looking at it

ABBY
Teddy Teddy theres been another yellow-fever victim

TEDDY
Dear me This will be a shock to the General

ABBY
No Teddy we must keep it a secret

MARTHA
Yeah

TEDDY
A state secret

ABBY
Yes a state secret

MARTHA
Promised

TEDDY

You have the word of the President of the United States
Cross my heart and hope to die

He crosses his chest and spits on the floor Then he takes his
aunts in his arms

TEDDY
Now lets see How are we going to keep it a secret

ABBY

Well Teddy I think youd better get back down into the
cellar And then when I turn out the lights when
everythings dark here you come up and take the poor man
down to the canal Now get along Teddy

Teddy crosses the room to the cellar door

ABBY
And well come down later and hold services

Teddy opens the door and turns around

TEDDY
Where is the poor devil

ABBY
(voice over)
In the window-seat

TEDDY
It seems to be spreading Weve never had yellow fever
there before

MARTHA
Abby Ive never even seen Mister Hoskins

ABBY

Oh my goodness Thats right you were out Well you just
come right along and see him now You know hes really
very nice looking considering that hes a Methodist

Both sisters go to the window-seat and are ready to lift the lid
when the drapes above the seat suddenly open wide revealing a
very menacing Jonathan The two sisters back off frightened

Jonathan slowly climbs in through the window and stands up on the
window-seat

JONATHAN
Were bringing the luggage through here

He gets down from the window-seat Then Einstein appears behind
the window carrying a suitcase Jonathan helps him to bring the
suitcase in the room

ABBY
Jonathan your room is waiting for you You can go right
up

Einstein still outside the window gives Jonathan another
suitcase

JONATHAN
Im afraid we dont keep Brooklyn hours You two run along
to bed

ABBY
Oh but you must be very tired Both of you And we dont
go to bed this early

JONATHAN

Its time I came home to take care of you
Behind Jonathan Einstein has come into the room and is closing
the window and then the drapes

JONATHAN
(to Einstein)
Take the bags upstairs
Einstein takes the two suitcases and starts moving away

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
For the instruments Ill come back later

ABBY
Good night

Einstein slightly bows to Abby

JONATHAN
Now well all go to bed

ABBY
Ill wait until youre up and then turn out the lights

Einstein has already almost reached the balcony Martha starts
climbing with Jonathan behind her

JONATHAN
Run along Aunt Martha Just off the laboratory Doctor

Everybody reaches the balcony Einstein disappears at the end of
the balcony and Martha enters her room Jonathan turns around and
looks down at Abby

JONATHAN
All right Aunt Abby

ABBY
Ill be right up

JONATHAN
Now Aunt Abby Turn out the lights

Abby goes to the switch near the front door and switches the
lights off The room is completely dark

Abby climbs the stairs reaches the balcony and walks slowly pass
Jonathan who is still standing at the same place Then she
quickly enters the room she shares with her sister who is holding
the door open for her

Jonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to
the upper floor He stops after a few steps and sees the door of
his aunts room opening slowly Abby comes out

JONATHAN
Aunt Abby

Abby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door Jonathan
resumes his climbing

The camera moves down into total black darkness and then into the
room where we see some light underneath the cellar door We hear
steps and the door opens to reveal Teddy still in his colonial
costume but without the helmet He stops a few seconds then
starts crossing the room only lit by light coming from underneath
the kitchen door We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking and
we guess Teddy has just opened it Shuffling noises Then we see
the shadow of Teddy carrying something apparently heavy We hear
the cat screaming and we guess Teddy must have stepped on its
tail When Teddy comes into the light from the open door of the
cellar we discover he is carrying a human body which could only
be Mr Hoskins one taken from the window-seat Teddy turns around
and starts going backward down the steps to the cellar He stops a
few seconds to close the door Then we hear noises of something
falling and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and
fallen all the way down to the cellar

Black screen during one second

Einstein is going down the staircase lit only by a match he is
holding in his hand

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hes all right Johnny

When he gets on floor level he meets Jonathan

JONATHAN
Ill open the window You go round and hand him through

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
But hes too heavy for me

He burns his finger and blows the match The scene becomes
completely dark We see only shadows

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
You go outside Johnny and push and Ill stay here and
pull And then together we take him down to Panama Huh

JONATHAN

All right We must be quick Ill take a look around
outside the house When I tap on the glass you open the
window

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yeah

Jonathan moves to the front door opens it stops to look around
and then closes the door

Einstein walks slowly in the room
DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Its dark in here

He bumps into something We hear the lid of the window-seat
creaking several times

Einstein light another match and we discover he has fallen into
the open window-seat where he is now lying

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Where am I Oh here I am

He slowly gets out of the seat

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Who left this open

Jonathan taps on the window Einstein blows the match and opens
the window

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Johnny

We see only shadows in the dark but we guess Jonathan is handing
Mr Spenalzos corpse to Einstein who will then put it in the
window-seat

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Okay Johnny wait a minute Hand him over Now I have him
«Allez » Up Now wait a minute Johnny You lost a leg
somewhere Hey help me Hes so heavy Now I have him Now
I got him

JONATHAN
Be careful

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Oh but his shoe came off Help me Johnny Hes so heavy
Now Ive got him

Knocking at the door
DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Hey Johnny somebodys at the door Go open quick

Ill manage Spenalzo Go quick

Some more knocking We hear the creaking of the lid of the window-
seat and we guess Einstein is closing it

The front door opens slowly and Elaine enters the house

ELAINE
Mortimer Aunt Abby
We see the frightened face of Einstein

ELAINE
(voice over)
Aunt Martha

Jonathan enters through the front door left open by Elaine closes
it and locks it

ELAINE

(looking frightened)

Who is it Is that you Teddy
JONATHAN

Who are you

ELAINE
Im Elaine Harper I live next door

JONATHAN
What are you doing here

ELAINE
I came here to see my husband Mortimer

JONATHAN
Why did you say your name was Harper

ELAINE
Well it is Harper I mean its Brewster Im not very
used to it Im a brand-new Brewster

Einstein goes to the front door and switches the lights on
JONATHAN
Doctor

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Its all right Johnny Its okay

Einstein has his little bottle in one hand and with the finger
of the other hand he tries to explain to Jonathan that the corpse
is safely in the window-seat

Jonathan looks at Einstein and then goes across the room to look
around He even moves the drapes of a window to look outside

ELAINE
(voice over)

Maybe youd better explain what youre doing here

Jonathan keeps on checking around He goes to the window above the
window-seat and looks outside

JONATHAN
We happen to live here

He spots an orphan shoe on the floor and picks it up

ELAINE

(voice over)

You dont live here Ive been in this house every day and
Ive never seen you before Where are Miss Martha and Miss
Abby What have you done to them

Einstein tries to explain to Jonathan without using words that
the shoe belongs to the corpse in the window-seat

JONATHAN

Perhaps wed better introduce ourselves May I present
Doctor Einstein

He puts the shoe on the table then lifts the tablecloth to look
underneath it

ELAINE
Doctor Einstein

JONATHAN

A surgeon of great distinction And something of a
magician

ELAINE
Now I suppose youre gonna tell me that youre Boris

JONATHAN
(cutting her very harshly)
I am Jonathan Brewster

ELAINE
Oh Youre Jonathan

Jonathan comes close to her and looks at her in such a strange way
that she starts walking backward
JONATHAN

Youve heard of me

ELAINE
Yes they talk about you

JONATHAN
What do they say about me

Elaine stops walking backward
ELAINE

Oh just that theres another brother named Jonathan
thats all they say Oh that explains everything Now that
I know who you are Ill just be running along if youll
kindly unlock the door

They move to the front door beside which Einstein is standing
smiling Jonathan unlocks the door He opens it a few inches but
stands in the way of Elaine ready to got out

JONATHAN
«That explains everything» Just what do you mean by that
Why do you come here at this time of night

ELAINE
Well I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up I suppose it
was you

Jonathan slams the door and locks it

JONATHAN
You thought you saw someone drive up

He walks menacingly toward her and she starts walking backward
across the room

ELAINE

Yes Werent you just outside Isnt that your car

JONATHAN
You saw someone at the car

ELAINE
Yes

Einstein starts walking behind Jonathan

JONATHAN
What else did you see

ELAINE
Oh just that thats all

JONATHAN
I see Is that why you came over here

ELAINE
Oh no I came to see Mortimer But if hes not home Ill
run

She tries to run away but Jonathan grabs her arms and holds it
very firmly
JONATHAN
Youve given two names

ELAINE
Youre hurting me

JONATHAN
I think shes dangerous

Teddy comes in through the cellar door He has his helmet back on
his head and wears heavy working gloves

TEDDY
No visitors Its going to be a private funeral

He crosses the room and starts climbing the stairs Both Jonathan
and Einstein are now holding Elaine

ELAINE
Teddy Teddy tell these men who I am

Teddy stops a few steps from floor level

TEDDY
Oh thats my daughter Alice

ELAINE
Oh no Teddy Teddy

TEDDY
Now Alice dont be a tomboy Dont play rough with the
gentlemen

He pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs

TEDDY
Charge

He rushes into his room and slams the door

ELAINE
Teddy

Elaine starts screaming Jonathan holds a handkerchief over her
mouth Einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights
off

JONATHAN
Doctor the cellar

ELAINE
Let go of me Let go of me
The cellar door is opened and we see the shadows of the two men
dragging Elaine down to the cellar

MARTHA

Whats the matter Whats happening down there

The lights are switched back on and we see Abby and Martha on the
balcony just coming out of their room They are both dressed in
black funeral clothes

ABBY
Whats the matter What are you doing there

Jonathan is coming alone out of the cellar

JONATHAN
We caught a burglar a sneak thief Go back to your room

ABBY

She starts going down the stairs followed by Martha

JONATHAN

Abby stops at the top of the stairs

JONATHAN
Do you hear me

Knocking on the door followed by the doorbell The two sisters
starts going down the stairs

JONATHAN
Dont answer that

Another doorbell The two sisters are running downstairs

JONATHAN
Dont answer that

Elaine rushes through the cellar door screaming She runs into
Marthas arms followed by Einstein

ELAINE
Let go of me

More knocking and ringing at the door Abby goes and opens the
door Mortimer enters the house

MORTIMER

Elaine rushes to Mortimer and holds him by the neck He gets rid
of her

MORTIMER

He starts climbing the stairs and looks surprised at Martha
MORTIMER

He suddenly notices Jonathans presence and stops mounting the
stairs

MORTIMER

Holy Whats that Whats that thing there that looks
like a cigar-store dummy

ABBY

MORTIMER
Aunt Abby didnt I tell you not to let anybody in the
house Who did you say it was

ABBY

Elaine grabs Mortimers coat and starts talking to him So do
Abby and Martha on either side of him Since the three of them are
talking together it is impossible to understand what they say

JONATHAN

At the voice of Jonathan the three women stop talking

MORTIMER

He walks away leaving the doctor very shaken by the experience
The doctor runs to Mortimer still outside Elaines window and
kissing her passionately The doctor clears loudly his throat to
attract Mortimers attention

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

MORTIMER
Go away

Those papers

Mortimer suddenly realizes what the doctor is talking about
MORTIMER
Oh papers Papers Yes

He pulls the papers from his jacket pocket and gives them to the
doctor

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

MORTIMER

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

MORTIMER
Ah you see Didnt I tell you

Elaine suddenly slams her window down on Mortimers fingers
Mortimer yells because of the pain The doctor looks up from the
papers Elaine also shut the inside shade down shutting the room
completely from the outside world

MORTIMER
No Dont worry about that Just go on signing the papers
Oh dear Thank you

Mortimer blows on his hurt fingers then grabs the papers from the
doctor and runs away

MORTIMER
Okay thank you

bottle in his hand
JONATHAN

He mimes the breaking of a neck with his fingers and then takes a
sip from his bottle

JONATHAN

(voice over from the shadow on the wall)

No Doctor I think this calls for something special I
think perhaps the Melbourne method

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Not the Melbourne method please Two hours And then
when it was all over what The fellow in London was just
as dead as the fellow in Melbourne

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony in his President

Roosevelt costume He takes his bugle to his mouth ready to play
it Mortimer comes out of the room and lowers the bugle
MORTIMER
No no no Dont do that Mister President

TEDDY

at the bottom of the stairs

Einstein climbs the stairs very rapidly He takes Mortimer by the
sleeve and whispers to him

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Hey Mister Brewster you get out of this house

MORTIMER

He tries to get rid of Einsteins hand on his sleeve

We hear the bugle playing the first notes of Beethovens fifth
symphony

MORTIMER
(singing the same tune)
Ta-ta-ta taaa

He knocks on Teddys door The papers are slid under the door
Mortimer bends down to pick them up

MORTIMER
Thank you Mister President Oh what a load off my mind

He takes the bottle out of Einsteins pocket

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

He tries to get his bottle back but Mortimer holds on it

MORTIMER

He moves away to the table with the bottle in his hand Einstein
joins his hand in a praying gesture

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But look Mr Brewster please Youve just been married
You have a nice little wife waiting for you Please go now
Please

Mortimer pours some of the schnapps in a glass

Einstein slams the front door with a very nervous punch and walks
toward Mortimer He mumbles incomprehensible words probably in
German

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Tell me dont those plays you see all the time teach you
anything

Mortimer is drinking He lowers his glass

MORTIMER

Oh stop it dont get me on the subject of plays Ive
got a lot on my mind now Ive got to wait here for Mister
Witherspoon

He looks at his watch
DOCTOR EINSTEIN
At least people in plays act like they got sense

MORTIMER
Oh you think so Did you ever see anybody in a play ever
act like they got intelligence

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
How can somebody be so stupid

MORTIMER

You ought to have my job a few nights Listen to me
brother When you get out of prison you have yourself
wheeled over to the Garrick Theater Oh Oh Theres a
play there thats been running so bad that itll still be
running when you get out Now in this theres a man
Now listen to this
Behind Mortimer the cellar door opens silently and Jonathan
enters slowly into the room without Mortimer noticing him

MORTIMER

Now he knows hes in the house with murderers So he ought
to know hes in danger Hes even been warned to get out of
the house And does he go

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yes

MORTIMER

No he doesnt He stays This fellow doesnt even have
sense to be scared or to be on his guard No no The
murderer even invites him to sit down What do you think he
does

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Well I dont know

MORTIMER

He sits down I remember what he did He deliberately
pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it

Mortimer goes to a wooden armchair and sits down in it He puts
his glass on the table

MORTIMER
Isnt that great So there he is all waiting to be

trussed up and gagged What do you think they used to truss
him up with

He keeps on laughing while talking
Close-up of Jonathans face smiling

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
(voice over)
Oh what

MORTIMER
(voice over)
The curtain cord

Jonathan looks in the direction of the window and the curtain
cord

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Curtain cord But didnt he see him get it

Behind the seated Mortimer Jonathan is silently walking to the
window
MORTIMER
Seen him get it No The silly chump sits down with his
back toward the murderer

Mortimer turns slightly on his chair but without taking his eyes
off Einstein and of course without looking at his brother

behind him quietly cutting the curtain cords with a jack-knife

MORTIMER
All he has to do is look around but does he No

Medium shot on Jonathan cutting the curtain cords

MORTIMER

(voice over)

No Look you see brother Heidelberg in a play or even
in a movie for that matter a fellow never sees or

hears anything No Thats right

Jonathan folds the jack-knife and puts it in his pocket He
prepares the cords he has just cut Einstein takes a napkin on the
table

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
But what does he do

MORTIMER
Oh what does he do Well the big chump sits there This
fellows supposed to be bright He sits there

Jonathan is now just behind Mortimers chair with the cord ready
in his hands

MORTIMER

Now get a load of this Look look at the attitude Large
as life He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged
The big dope

He bursts out laughing But only for two seconds because
Jonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind and Einstein
shoves the napkin in his open mouth Einstein then helps Jonathan
to tie Mortimers legs to the legs of the armchair Then with the
help of a knife he puts all the napkin in Mortimers mouth

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
You were right about that fellow He wasnt very bright

Fade out and then fade in on the same scene a few moments later
The lights have been dimmed Mortimer is completely tied on the

chair and the gag is tied around his head

JONATHAN
Yes Mortimer Ive been away for twenty years But never
my dear brother were you out of my mind

Jonathan is lighting candles on the table

JONATHAN
In Melbourne one night I dreamt of you

He opens his instruments case We see the surgery instruments
shining in the candles light

Close-up on Mortimers very frightened face

Einstein sits down near the table He seems depressed at the sight
of his surgery instruments

Jonathan takes a small phial from the inside pocket of his jacket
opens it smells it and closes it and puts it back in his pocket

JONATHAN
The more you struggle Mortimer the more you strangle
yourself Later on you may consider that a blessing

He takes a curved forceps from the case and plays with it
Close-up on Mortimers frightened face
Einstein wipes his face with a napkin

Jonathan takes a scalpel from the case and feels the sharpness of
the blade

Einstein takes a bottle on the table and brings it to his mouth
Unfortunately the bottle is empty

Jonathan takes a pair of surgery gloves from the box and puts them
on

JONATHAN
Now Doctor we go to work

Einstein stands up

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Johnny for me please the quick way Please

JONATHAN
Doctor this must be an artistic achievement

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Please

JONATHAN
After all were performing before a very distinguished
critic

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Johnny please

JONATHAN
Doctor

Einstein takes his jacket off He is almost crying

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
All right Lets get it over with No but Johnny I
cannot see this without a drink

JONATHAN
Pull yourself together Doctor

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But I cant pull myself together without a drink Johnny
you remember when we came in here there was some wine And
then they took it Where did they put it

A glint of hope appears in Mortimers eyes at the mention of his
aunts wine

Einstein runs across the room to the shelves where the carafe of
poisoned wine has been put away

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Johnny I found some wine I found some wine

He comes back to the table with the carafe and glasses

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Here Ill split it with you We both have a drink before
we operate Oh I am so happy that we dont have to operate
without a drink

Einstein gives a glass to Jonathan Mortimer who recognized the
carafe is smiling behind his gag Jonathan smells the glass
Einstein has his glass almost to his lips when Jonathan stops
him

JONATHAN

Doctor One moment please Where are your manners

(to Mortimer)

Yes Mortimer I realize now that it was you who brought me
back to Brooklyn We drink to you Doctor To my dear
dead brother

They clink their glass in front of Mortimers face Einstein
raises his glass before drinking

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Prosit

Teddy suddenly comes out of his room and plays his bugle very
loudly

Both Jonathan and Einstein drop their glass on the floor

Teddy then goes back into his room and slams the door The grand-
father clock chimes once

Mortimer seems very disappointed He moves back and forth in his
chair moaning

JONATHAN
That idiot He goes next Thats all He goes next

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Not Teddy Not Teddy Please

JONATHAN
Well get to him later

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Not Teddy we wont get to him at all

JONATHAN
Now we have to work fast The quick way

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Oh the quick way oh yes If it has to be then the quick
way Yes Ill help you with it

They starts getting the instruments out of the case

At the front door we see the shadow of a policeman behind the
frosted glass He rings the doorbell

Jonathan and Einstein stop what they were doing Einstein closes
the case and puts it under the table He also puts all the
instruments lying on the table on the floor behind the case

Knocking on the door The door being open OHara enters the room
He spots Jonathan and Einstein

OHARA

Hey the colonel has to quit blowing that horn

JONATHAN

Its all right Officer Were taking the bugle away from
him
OHARA
Id better talk to him myself Wheres the lights

He finds the switch by the door and switches the lights on He
goes to the stairs and starts mounting them when he hears
Mortimer moaning He goes down and walks toward Mortimer

OHARA
Hey You stood me up Ive been waiting for you for over
an hour at Kellys What happened to him

OHara is surprised to find Mortimer tied up on his chair He
points his stick to Jonathan

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Nothing He was explaining a play he saw the other night
and thats what happened to a poor man in the play

He walks away with his jacket in his hands

OHARA

Oh I see Did that really happen in a play you saw How
do you like that You cant trust nobody no more They
practically stole that from the second act of my play You
know in the second act just Well maybe Id better
start at the beginning

Mortimer is moving and moaning on his chair He tries to explain
by movements of his face that he would like to have his gag taken

off

Behind OHara Einstein starts mounting the stairs and Jonathan
stands up at the bottom of them

OHARA
Huh Oh yes sure

He puts his hands to Mortimers face to take off his gag
Einstein runs upstairs followed by Jonathan
Suddenly OHara removes his hands and smiles broadly

OHARA
Nooo Youve got to hear the plot

He takes his jacket off

OHARA

My mothers sitting there making up see And like a
flash suddenly out of a clear sky the door comes open
and a man with a black mustache comes in
On the stairs behind OHara Jonathan takes his jack-knife out of
his pocket and opens it
OHARA
He turns to my mother and he says «Miss Peaches La Tour
will you marry me » Thats the first scene My mother
doesnt tell him theyre married Thats the surprise

Einstein who has seen the knife tries to stop Jonathan But
Jonathan keeps on walking slowly downstairs

OHARA

Oh What a kick All right Twenty-five years pass Well
in the meantime theres me Growing into a magnificent
specimen So what do I do I join the police force and
become one of New Yorks finest Well Im cleaning out a
crooked laundry see

Close-up on Jonathans hand holding the knife the blade of which
is shining in the light

Mortimer stares at the knife

OHARA

Little do I know it but there is a dope fiend with a long
knife crawling after me Im in great danger Its getting
you aint it I can see it in your eyes

Actually Mortimers eyes are trying to attract OHaras attention
to Jonathan just behind him now

OHARA
Well you aint heard nothing yet

Einstein tries to stop Jonathan but Jonathan pushes him away
Einstein takes off one of his shoes and hits Jonathan very hard
on the head with it Jonathan falls on the floor

OHARA
All of a sudden a fire breaks out What an effect The

firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia

OHara turns around and sees Jonathan lying on the last steps of
the stairs

OHARA
Whats the matter with him

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yeah probably your play put him to sleep

OHARA
What

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
I personally I like it very much

OHARA
Its probably over his head huh

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Yeah
OHara looks at Jonathans face

OHARA
Where have I seen that face before

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
No please

He kneels beside Jonathans body and OHara returns to Mortimer

OHARA

Well the scene changes Its an evolving stage Im
walking along my beat well like that casual-like when a
guy that Im following it turns out hes really following
me

Knocks at the door OHara turns to Einstein

OHARA

(to Einstein)

Dont let nobody in

(to Mortimer)

I figure Ill outsmart him Theres a vacant house on the
corner

Einstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of
the front door He rushes to Jonathan

DOCTOR EINSTEIN
Hey Johnny the cops

Einstein tries to wake up Jonathan but doesnt succeed He picks
up his shoe and rushes upstairs

OHARA

So I ducks in there I sees the door handle turn so I
pulls out my gun braces myself against the wall and I
says «Come in »

He takes out his gun and points it at the door Brophy and another
cop officer Saunders come in When they see OHaras gun
pointing at them they raise their arms OHara puts his gun back
in his

holster and welcomes his colleagues

OHARA
Oh hello boys

BROPHY
What the Sam Hills going on here

OHARA
Hello Sarge what do you think this is Mortimer Brewster
Hes going to help me write my play

SAUNDERS
Do you have to tie him up to make him listen

He starts to untie Mortimer

Brophy

BROPHY
OHara you better report in the station Why didnt you
ring in You got the whole force out looking for you

OHARA
Right in the middle of the second act Did they send you
guys here looking for me

goes to the telephone and starts dialing

BROPHY
No we came to warn the old ladies There is a difficulty
The colonel blew that bugle again

OHARA
Yeah I heard him

BROPHY
The neighbors are all phoning in The Lieutenants on the
warpath He says weve got to put him away someplace

He sees Jonathan lying on the steps

BROPHY
Now who the heck is this

OHARA

sleep

BROPHY

Oh Thats the one that ran away So he came back

(in the phone)

Brophy Get me Mac

OHara bends on Jonathan and shakes him

OHARA
Hey It wasnt that bad was it

BROPHY

(in the phone)

Mac Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt
We found him At the Brewster house Shall we bring him
in All right well hold him right here

He puts the phone down and turns to OHara who has succeeded in
waking up Jonathan and getting him on his feet Jonathan stares at
Brophy He thinks Brophy is talking about him

Mortimer looks at his left hand which has just been freed by
Saunders

BROPHY

The Lieutenant is on his way over

JONATHAN

So Ive been turned in hey All right youve got me I
suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the
reward

Brophy and OHara each take one arm of Jonathan

BROPHY and OHARA
Reward

JONATHAN
Yes reward Now Ill do some turning in

Mortimer who had his hand and legs untied by Saunders but is
still gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair moans
and moves excitedly on his seat

OHARA
(to Jonathan)
Oh wait a minute Mr Brewster

JONATHAN

You think my aunts are sweet charming old ladies dont
you Well theres thirteen bodies buried in the cellar
Yes thirteen

Mortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag
Since he cannot succeed to get off the chair he stands up still
gagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to Brophy
carrying the armchair with him
BROPHY
Be careful what you say about your aunts they happen to be
friends of ours

JONATHAN
Ill show them to you

BROPHY
Dont you make any trouble for them do you hear me

Mortimer walks between Brophy and Jonathan and tries to say
something to Brophy through his gag Saunders behind Mortimer
keeps on untying him

BROPHY

(to Mortimer)

Never mind Mr Brewster Leave him to me Ill take care
of him

JONATHAN
(to OHara)
You come down to the cellar

OHARA

(to Jonathan)
Now wait a minute

Mortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to OHara and

Brophy

and moves excitedly around the two cops He moves so much

that Saunders has stopped trying to untie him

JONATHAN
Thirteen bodies Ill show you where theyre buried

OHARA
Oh yeah

BROPHY
Go down to the cellar with him OHara

JONATHAN
Yes come to the cellar

He grabs OHaras hand and drags him to the cellar door

OHARA
Well look do I have to

Mortimer still gagged and still carrying his armchair like a
backpack tries to follow them but Saunders moves him away
Mortimer runs round the table to try again to join the party going
down to the cellar with Saunders running behind him

OHARA
Sorry maybe I dont want to go down to the cellar with
him

Mortimer bumps violently into Brophy who tries to push him away

BROPHY
OHara go on down the cellar with him

Mortimer then goes to OHara but OHara doesnt realize Mortimer
is coming to him to prevent him going down to the cellar

OHARA
Now please Mister Brewster Ill tell you the rest of my
play later

He pushes Mortimer away from him

BROPHY
Go on down to the cellar with him

OHARA
Gee do I have to Sarge Look at that puss He looks like
Boris Karloff

Hearing that Jonathan screams jumps on OHara and puts his hand
around his throat

OHARA

(to Jonathan)
Dont

(to Brophy)
Sarge

The three cops and Jonathan starts fighting A fist comes out of
the battle and hits Mortimer on the chin He staggers back to the
center of the room and falls on the floor

We see Einstein cautiously appearing on the landing of the upper
floor of the house He slowly comes down the stairs

Down in the sitting-room the fight goes on Saunders falls on his
back and Jonathan jumps on him OHara in his turn jumps on
Jonathan Behind them Mortimer is slowly getting up and getting
rid of his ropes Apparently his fall has completely untied him

Einstein watching this heated fight moves back to the upper
floor

Mortimer gets rid of his gag and slowly moves away from the
battle

BROPHY
(voice over)
Look out Pat Look out Pat

SAUNDERS
(voice over)
Hes got a gun

BROPHY
(voice over)
I got him Pat Look out

MORTIMER
Fight Go on and fight

Mortimer climbs up a few steps on the staircase and sits down on a
step

MORTIMER
Thats enough thats enough Everybody off

BROPHY
(voice over)
Pat Pat look out

Mortimer still seated on the step quietly gets his cigarette
case from his pocket takes a cigarette puts the case back in his
pocket while we hears the noise of the battle still going on down
below

MORTIMER

Amazing Such a fine day too All I did was cross the
bridge and I was in Brooklyn Amazing Amazing amazing

He takes a matchbox from another pocket and lights his cigarette
Behind Mortimer on the wall we see the shadows of the men
fighting Then we see various objects falling around Mortimer

MORTIMER
Dont Dont bother me now

OHara is projected on the wall below the staircase near the
place where Mortimer is still quietly seated
MORTIMER

Buddy you could use this in the third act
OHARA

Oh yes I got something better than this Let me tell
you
Jonathan breaks a chair on his back OHara staggers slightly

OHARA
Ill see you later

He goes back in the battle Jonathan gives him a heavy punch and
OHara falls in the window-seat closing the lid over himself in
his fall

Back to Mortimer still quietly smoking his cigarette seated on
the same step He takes papers out of his pocket

MORTIMER

I got the papers signed There theyre all signed What do
I care Go ahead go ahead fight fight fight-fight-
fight

OHara cautiously lifts the lid of the window-seat but seeing a
chair flying in his direction he slams it back shut The chair
hits the window-seat and breaks off in small pieces

Back to Mortimer on his steps He puts the papers back in his
pocket

MORTIMER
Id better call up and see if Witherspoon has left

He puts his hand through the banister of the staircase to take the
telephone on the desk but he cannot reach it

MORTIMER
Telephone Hey

At this moment Jonathan comes smashing on the wall below the
staircase He grabs the telephone and lifts it to throw it on the
cops bringing it within easy reach of Mortimers hand

JONATHAN
Ill get every one of you I hate cops Ill brain the
first one that comes near me

Mortimer picks up the telephone handset and starts dialing

MORTIMER
Yeah A little higher please brother

Jonathan is watching the cops around him and he is not looking at
all at his brother behind him Without thinking about it he lifts
the telephone a little higher

MORTIMER
Thank you very much Yeah thats fine
Jonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his
head toward him Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him
with his stick Jonathan starts falling and Mortimer has to pick
up the telephone not to loose it

MORTIMER
Oh Dont do that please

BROPHY
Get him Pat

Saunders comes on the other side of Jonathan and hits him with his
stick

MORTIMER

(in the phone)

Come on doc

(to the cops)

That wont have any effect Ive tried it before

Jonathan falls heavily on the floor
MORTIMER
Oh it did Dear me Isnt that amazing

OHara slowly lifts the lid of the window-seat
Saunders bends on the motionless body of Jonathan

MORTIMER
Oh dear Wish I could relax like that

The doorbell rings and we see the shadow of a hatted man through
the frosted glass Mortimer looks at the door

MORTIMER
Witherspoon

BROPHY
Come in

The visitor enters Its Lieutenant Rooney a plain-cloth
policeman He closes the door behind him Both Brophy and Saunders
stand at attention Mortimer puts the phone receiver back on its
hook OHara comes out of the window-seat and seeing his
superior stands at attention Rooney walks to the body of
Jonathan

LIEUTENANT ROONEY
What has occurred

BROPHY and SAUNDERS
(speaking together)
OHara

Well we

LIEUTENANT ROONEY
Never mind Didnt I tell you Id handle this myself

comes out of the window-seat to join his colleagues
OHARA
Well Lieutenant We were just acting in self-defense

LIEUTENANT ROONEY
(pointing to the body of Jonathan)
What happened He put up a fight

BROPHY
This isnt the one who blows the bugle This is his
brother He tried to kill OHara

OHARA
All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff

LIEUTENANT ROONEY
Boris Turn him over

Saunders turns Jonathan over and both the lieutenant and Brophy
bends on the face of Jonathan

Rooney

BROPHY
Kind of think hes wanted somewhere
stands up and looks at Brophy with an ironical smile

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Oh You «kind of think hes wanted somewhere» If you
guys cant look at the circulars we put up in the station

hes wanted somewhere In Indiana He escaped from the
prison for criminally insane Hes a lifer

Still seated on his step Mortimer smiles

MORTIMER
Thats my brother

LIEUTENANT ROONEY
For Petes sake thats the way they described him «He
looked like Karloff» Whyd you have to knock him off

BROPHY
He tried to get us to go down to the cellar He says there
