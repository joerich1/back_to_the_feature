VIRTUOSITY
by
Eric Bernt

THIRD REWRITE August 24 1994

Two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street Hunters
hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle

The sidewalk is crowded with people So is the street Too
many people not enough cement Los Angeles 1997

Summer probably August 103 degrees Heat shimmers off the
horizon Making the sky look peculiar

The men keep running Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop
watching a television in his lap YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER

NEWSCASTER (V 0)
As L A P D officers gather
evidence at this grisly crime
scene you can only ask yourselves
— what kind of lunatic would
commit such unthinkable crimes

(a beat)

The three adjectives which best
describe this killer are sadistic
intelligent and dangerous

The guy pays little attention to the broadcast He seems
almost bored by it Like this kind of news is commonplace Or
hes got more important things on his mind

Everybody is sweating Including the two men struggling to
swim upstream in the river of pedestrians

Their uniforms are freshly pressed Their shoes just recently
shined Hair tightly cropped Faces perfectly shaved Clearly
men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police
Department The guy in the lead is

PARKER BARNES
His body is a running backs His
endurance a marathoners His face
one youd want for your own Hes
in his 30s If he was in his 20s
youd still be jealous

His partner is JOHN DONLEY late 20s eager to prove himself
He struggles to keep up with Parker John accidently knocks
over several pedestrians They give no reaction except to
pick themselves up and continue on their way

Parker and John keep charging Their conversation breathless

JOHN
I cant get over how different you
look
PARKER
(ruefully)

Five years can be a bitch huh

They split-up The Maitre D still facing the front doors
repeats his greeting to no one in particular

MAITRE D
Good afternoon May I help you

Parker spots Sid 67 across the room Without hesitation the
hunter chases his prey Gun out and firing NOT what you
would call Standard Police Procedure

Bullets riddle Sid 67s table as he dives from his chair He
lands next to a bowling ball bag which sits beneath his
table

John charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up
from her chair standing directly in Johns line of fire

JOHN
(to the Woman)
Lady move

Before she can do so Sid 67 stands behind the Woman
grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker
CRASH They tumble to the floor

In the same movement Sid 67 removes a gun from inside his
jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire
Johns gun flies from his hand Sid 67 advances toward him

Parker struggles to his feet Aims his weapon Sid 67 does
the same but without looking BOOM Parker gets a bullet
through his shooting arm His wound IDENTICAL to Johns
Parkers weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp

Parker charges him wildly but Sid 67 brutally kicks him in
the stomach In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in
the background Parker doubles over gasping for breath
Another kick drops Parker to his knees

SID 67
(to Parker)
Im going to rehearse with your
friend a while then Ill be back
to perform a new piece with you

He grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into Johns head
knocking him out Sid 67 puts Johns unconscious body over
his shoulder

SID 67 (CONTD)
If you get hungry Id recommend
the escargot Theyre delicious

He carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen
Parker scrambles to his gun and races after Sid 67

INSIDE THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN

Parker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables who
work undistracted The Vegetables look plastic

Parker turns a corner stopping fast At the other end of the
aisle stands Sid 67 who presses his gun against the head of
a frightened BUSBOY Sid 67 holds the Busboys body in front
of his own as a shield

PARKER
(to Sid 67)
Wheres John

SID 67
Performing solo

(a beat)
Enjoying the concert so far

Advancing up the aisle Parker levels his gun at Sid 67 with
his good arm Now all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs
watch the showdown

PARKER
Recitals over asshole

He fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy
hitting Sid 67

The Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid
67s grasp to the floor Dead

Sid 67 stares at Parker in disbelief Blood is now visible
flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 67s shoulder which was
caused by the same bullet Sid 67s arm dangles uselessly
His gun lies on the floor

SID 67
(surprised but pleased)
You and me arent so different
after all

Parker again pulls the trigger Click Click click No
bullets

SID 67 (CONTD)
Like a violin without strings

He takes off around the corner Grabbing another clip from
inside his uniform Parker goes after him Only to stumble
over something Sid 67s bowling bag Blood flows through
its zipper You now realize the object inside is NOT a
bowling ball

Beside the bowling bag lies Johns body which is convulsing
His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire John is
being electrocuted Parker kicks away the wires but not in
time

PARKER
SHIT

He scans the room for Sid 67 Parker has no idea Sid 67 is
standing directly behind him Sid 67 grabs Parker by the
throat

SID 67
I told you I was going to perform a
new piece with you Its called
First You Suffer Then You Die
Hope you like it

Parker gags unable to breathe He then starts to DE-—
MATERIALIZE from within Sid 67s grasp

SID 67 (CONTD)
(as if to God)
NOOOH You cant take him yet Im
not finished

Johns body also de-materializes as Parker disappears
entirely
The blood seeping from Sid 67s wound stops flowing and
starts retracting into his body Along with his bone
fragments His shoulder is healing itself Right before your
very eyes We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is

ON A MONITOR

The scene continues seamlessly Sid 67s skin heals over his
shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their
proper places No scar whatsoever

His clothing also returns to perfect condition Literally as
good as new This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING

The previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets His wound
healing by itself We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor
is one of several

INSIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER

aka LETAC The facility is a converted aerospace research
building in Pacoima Funded by government black book dollars

The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech
sparkle Banks upon banks of computer equipment Wires
cables conduits connectors everywhere you look

In complete disarray to the uninitiated But to those in the
know this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the
world

The building is partitioned into dozens of stations At each
station a leading engineer in his field is frantically

readying a prototype for demonstration Each new technology
designed to help fight the new Cold War the War on Crime

The atmosphere is competitive Voices are loud Tension
anticipation in the air Only a lucky few will have their
inventions approved for production

LETAC is quite simply Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from

At a station in the middle of the room TWO UNCONSCIOUS
BODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps
made of polyurethane

Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it
at points designated as neural primes Each needle is
directly connected to the participants nervous system
The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic
wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers
surrounding the beds

Each of these components isnt much to look at on its own
But together with the rest of the apparatus are part of
something very new — a revolutionary law enforcement
training device whose name you read

VIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR

To be perfectly clear the events you just witnessed
involving Parker John and Sid 67 took place within virtual
reality not the real world

Dozens of small character modules similar to todays
Nintendo game cartridges are plugged into the systems main
console

Each of the modules bares a name and number such as MAITRE
D 17 and SHEILA 32 There is no character version number
greater than 40 Until you see the module labelled SID 67

The simulation timer stops at 17 hours 52 minutes 11
seconds A clock reads 30432 PM

Four observers two men and two women watch virtual reality
monitors positioned around the station One of the men wears
an L A P D uniform His name is WILLIAM COX 40S His
nameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE

One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor
Intently following the action on screen Studying it
clinically Her name is DR MADISON CARTER late 30s

She is beautiful and charming but those qualities take a
back seat to her intelligence She is one of the countrys
foremost authorities on criminal psychology Her concerns are
empirical Her quest is knowledge She has little in common
with the other observers

The other man is FREDERICK WALLACE 50s ChairmanCEO of
LETAC Expensive suit Commanding powerful But not as
commanding or powerful as ELIZABETH DEANE 605 the
Presidentially—appointed Crime Czars

Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated
to LETAC As well as which prototypes will move on to
production

DEANE
(quietly to Wallace)
What did Cox pull him out early
for

WALLACE
Barnes used to work for him when he
was still a cop in the field
remember

DEANE
(a beat)
Dont remind me

LAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the
two unconscious bodies The acupuncture needles remain in the
caps You can now see the faces of the participants

Parker and John
Parker lies calmly his eyes fluttering as he gradually

returns to consciousness He looks very different than his
virtual rendering

His hair is long and ragged His face is unshaven A scar
across his cheek A hoop earring in one ear His outfit a
filthy prison uniform

Johns outfit matches Parkers Physically he looks as
clean-cut as his virtual rendering Except that he is
convulsing Violently

His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around
him Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure Its ugly
Frightening

PARKER
(barely conscious)
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING

TWO PARAMEDICS burst through the doors and rush to John The
paramedics inject him Fibrillate him Repeatedly

The simulators designer DARYL LINDENMEYER 40s high—
strung intense and brilliant beyond words stands by the
equipment protectively He is far more concerned for the
safety of his machines than he is for Johns life

Johns body goes limp His vital signs flat The Paramedics
record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet
They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out

DEANE
(annoyed to Wallace)
What the hell happened

WALLACE

(pointing to needles)
Lindenmeyer developed neural
connectors that tap directly into
the nervous system If the
simulator isnt calibrated
properly experiencing death in
this level of VR is like
experiencing death within a dream
The experience becomes real

DEANE
(angrily)
Simulations are supposed to give
participants practice in realistic
dangerous scenarios while
protecting them from the risks they
are exposed to in the real world

WALLACE
(annoyed to Lindenmeyer)
I was assured the problem was
corrected

LINDENMEYER
I did fix it I told you I did I
dont know why it happened again

DEANE
Again

Cox
(a beat)
My first two pairs of convicts
suffered the same fate

DEANE
(coldly to Wallace)
Why wasnt I told

WALLACE
Black book dollars black book
operation You pay me for results
not how for how I get you there

Cox
(to Deane)
Ill tell you one thing -— there is

no way in hell we should allow any
real officers to train in this damn
thing

DEANE
Then about all Ive spent 37
million developing is a very
expensive way to control the prison
population

After giving Wallace a cold hard stare -- namely at his hand
stitched lapel his gold watch and his diamond-studded
cufflinks she exits Wallace follows after her quickly You
now notice that the chair Dr Madison Carter had occupied is
now empty She left a while ago

Cox remains Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as
if it were his child There are several scratches but no
major damage He looks relieved

PARKER
(struggling to sit up)
Heonly had a year left on his
sentence

LINDENMEYER
(annoyed)
How much do you think I care

Parker still not fully conscious hurls himself at
Lindenmeyer

LINDENMEYER (CONT D)
(hysterical)
Dont touch meDONT TOUCH ME

He flails his arms wildly Nearly spasming This is clearly a
man who should never drink coffee TWO armed GUARDS whove
been standing in the background pull Parker off Lindenmeyer
and throw him to the ground

Lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put
Parker in handcuffs and leg chains

Cox
Ill walk him out

The Guards back off as Cox helps Parker to his feet
COX (CONTD)
(to Parker)
You all right

PARKER
(still clearing his head)
Whyd you pull me out

Cox
Donley started experiencing the
attack for real If I hadnt gotten
you out the same thing would have
happened to you
(a beat)
You may not believe this Parker

but I still consider us friends

He helps Parker toward the exit as he continues having
difficulty with his balance

OUTSIDE LETAC

The building is heavily-guarded Razor wire land mines
armed sentries Nobody who shouldnt be here gets anywhere
near here

Cox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport
The two guards walk behind at a distance Two more by the
transport The chain between Parkers legs keeps his steps
short

Cox
What the hell did you have to shoot
the busboy for

PARKER
He was a computer program for
crissake

COX

You were supposed to act as if
everything was real

PARKER
Real my ass Its an overblown
game
(a beat)
Anybody ever catch that fucking
psycho

Cox
Before you nobody else had gotten
close enough to Sid 67 to take a
shot at him Hell nobody else had
even been able to start tracking
him before he got to them first
(eyeing Parkers scar)
New scar — you making it okay in
there

PARKER
(head down)
Im getting by

He starts walking ahead of Cox Distancing himself

Cox
(pausing for emphasis) )
Youve got to know I tried keeping
you out of general population
Goddam politicians

His voice trails off as Parker turns around and heads
directly toward him

PARKER

(locking eyes)
You want to know how Im doing
Every day I lose a little bit more
of myself

(a beat)
Im becoming something else and it
scares the hell out of me

He turns back toward the transport Cox follows Two armed
GUARDS open the back doors for Parker then stand poised with
weapons out and ready

INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

Cold metal benches No windows Parker climbs in the only
passenger He looks out the open doors to Cox

PARKER
(half-heartedly)
But with the six months off I get
for being your guinea pig Ive
only got to survive another 17
years 5 months and 23 days

COx
Dont give up Parker Not ever

PARKER
(a beat)
You know those cheesy Christmas
cards of your family under that
tree in your back yard you keep
sending me every year

Cox
What about them

PARKER
(a beat)
Do me a favor — keep sending them

OUTSIDE LETAC

Standing outside the transport Cox puts his hand on Parkers
shoulder

Cox
Take care pal

Behind him Johns body is loaded into an ambulance The
Guards SLAM the prison transport doors shut

INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR
Parker sits in DARKNESS as the transport begins its trek The

only light comes from a four inch portal covered in steel
mesh through which the Guards can keep an eye on him

GUARD
(tauntingly)
Hey Parker — Im real sorry John

boy got fried What do you think
Big Reds gonna do when he finds
out you came back without his girl
friend

Parker sits in silence
CUT TO
INSIDE LETAC

Sid 67 remains visible on the various monitors around the
room as Lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator

SID 67
(from the monitors)
Dont be angry with me Daryl

LINDENMEYER
(a beat)
Did you recognize the son-of-a
bitch who got away
SID 67
Should I have

LINDENMEYER
Think hard -- itll come to you

Wallace enters briskly

WALLACE
You embarrassed me in front of the
highest-ranking law enforcement
official in the country
(a beat)
Do you have any idea how much money
you just cost me

LINDENMEYER
The reason you insisted on testing
my system with prisoners is because
of the increased risks involved
with increased realism

WALLACE
Of the six prison inmates youve
tested — all of whom have had at
least some military or survival
training -— only Mr Barnes is
still breathing

LINDENMEYER
Im still making adjustments

WALLACE

Youve had a year-and-a—half to
make all the adjustments you want
Lindenmeyer

(moving closer) )
Elizabeth Deane does not give
second chances Neither do I
Youre fired

LINDENMEYER
(hysterical)
IM WHAT
WALLACE

(relishing his authority)
You are to turn over the Sid 67
program and all its documentation
for immediate destruction Is that
understood
LINDENMEYER
(restraining himself)
I understand I understand
perfectly

Wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door On the
monitors Sid 67 starts walking toward you Into a CLOSEUP

SID 67
(from the monitor)
Hey Wallace you really think you
can shut me down

Wallace stops staring at a monitor in disbelief

WALLACE
(to Lindenmeyer)
How does he know who I am

LINDENMEYER
(pointing to microphone)
He hearseverything

WALLACE
(approaching the monitor)
As a matter of fact I do

He exits
ON THE MONITORS

around the room Sid 67 walks to a pay phone and dials a
number

INSIDE AN INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR

Wallace walks toward the buildings entrance His footsteps
ECHO His cellular phone RINGS

WALLACE
This is Wallace

SID 67 (V 0)
(through phone)
As a matter of fact little man
youre wrong I think therefore I
am

Click Sid 67 hangs-up Wallace stops staring at his phone
in disbelief

CUT TO
INSIDE FOLSOM COUNTY MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

Parker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint He
is ordered to remove his clothing

He stands completely naked arms held out to the sides as he
is strip searched Every portion of the body in which someone
could hide something is closely inspected

Without being graphic we watch the de-humanizing procedure
He opens his mouth as wide as possible Pulls his earlobes
foreword to reveal behind them Then bends over hands on the
floor in front of him

He is scanned with a metal detector So is his clothing
which is then returned to him

GUARD 1
Welcome home cop

CuT TO
INSIDE THE PRISON CAFETERIA

Parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates The food
is unrecognizable The air thick with humidity and cigarette
smoke Nobody is talking Just staring At Parker

Parker forces down the remainder of his meal then returns
his utensils to a bin And heads to the bathroom All eyes
following Parkers every move

The other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of
incredible size following Parker 6 6 255 lbs His face
covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago
This is BIG RED He follows Parker into the bathroom

INSIDE THE BATHROOM

Graffiti covers the walls Red uses a stained urinal then
turns to the stalls A pair of prison-issue shoes and socks
are visible beneath one of them

RED
Time to hurt

Red kicks in the door to the stall Revealing a pair of shoes
and socks stuffed with a prison shirt Red hears something

behind him And turns around slowly

Parker stands barefooted and shirtless SCARS are visible
around each arm just below the elbow You will learn what
these represent momentarily

Parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red
But the punch Parker delivers to Reds face makes you think
its the other way around

You HEAR the sound of metal crushing bone Red is thrown
backwards into the stall Blood splatters from his mouth
adding another shade of redness to his face

Reds teeth stick out of Parkers fist Parker pulls out the
teeth He does not bleed Nor seem in pain Metal is visible
beneath the surface of his skin

For the first time you notice SMALL TATTOOS on the outsides
of his palms They read WENTLOW MODEL 17-L and 17-R
followed by serial numbers

Red charges Parker wildly Parker dodges him like a matador
does a bull Then brings his fists down savagely on the back
of Reds head His skull CRACKS Red drops to the floor

Parker jumps on top of him arms around his neck Choking
him Red staggers to his feet His eyes wide His face now
even redder

Parker maintains his mechanical grip Red finally succumbs to
the lack of oxygen He drops to his knees Parker does not
relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his
head

GUARD
Funs over

Parker lets go dropping Red to the wet filthy floor
CuT TO
INSIDE THE PRISON HOSPITAL

The room isnt clean The technology is outdated A large
female NURSE applies epoxy-like sealant to the synthetic skin
on Parkers fingers

NURSE
I still dont know why they wasted
this fancy new technology on you
Every time I fix you up you only
go and mess it up again

She sandpapers off the excess sealant Then places his elbow
into an electronic sensitivity adjuster

NURSE
Tell me how this feels

She pricks Parkers finger with a pin

PARKER
ow

NURSE
(smiling)
Ill dial it down a little

She does so then pricks Parkers finger again He grimaces
in pain

NURSE (CONTD)
That about right

PARKER
Itll never feel right

NURSE
At least they work Would you
rather have no hands at all

PARKER
Sometimes

CUT TO

SYNTHETIC BODY PARTS lying strewn around one of the stations
in LETAC the NEXT DAY Its a good bet this is the same
technology attached to Parkers elbows

There are also various shapes and sizes of robots androids
and other synthetic forms The most human—looking ones are
the least functional The least human—looking ones the most
functional

You follow a remote-controlled box—shaped robotic sentry
moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a subway
station It is being operated by CLYDE REILLY 20s a
hardware genius who has spent too much time in windowless
rooms

Hidden from Reillys view Lindenmeyer the software expert
who created Sid 67 stares jealously through a narrow gap in
a partition Trying to contain his anger And failing
Especially as
Wallace enters the station carrying a bottle of Dom Perignon
and two glasses Wallace hugs Reilly who does not return the
gesture

WALLACE
Congratulations Reilly

He pops the cork and pours their glasses

WALLACE (CONTD)
(toasting)
To the first LETAC engineer to go
into production on prototypes

REILLY
As long as you keep overpaying me
Ill be the first to go into
production on three and four as
well

WALLACE
As long as they keep overpaying me
Ill keep overpaying you
(dropping the revelry) )
Just make goddam sure you can have
10 of them ready for deployment
around the city by next month

REILLY
Mr Wallace I could have 10 of
them ready by tomorrow

WALLACE
(a beat)
Do they have to look sorobotic

REILLY
At this stage you either get form
or function You said she wanted
function I gave you function What
are you complaining about

He remote controls the robotic sentry to chase Wallace out of
the station Lindenmeyer can no longer be seen through the
gap in the partition

INSIDE LINDENMEYERS STATION

Lindenmeyer storms in angrily Sid 67 is visible on the
virtual reality monitors around the simulator Hes giving
himself a manicure
LINDENMEYER
All they want to produce around
here is mediocrity

SID 67
True genius is rarely rewarded
within its lifetime

LINDENMEYER
(a revelation)
It was you wasnt it

SID 67
(innocently)
It was me what

LINDENMEYER
You amped the neural connectors
back up didnt you
(angrily)
Youre the reason the convict died
Youre the reason I got fired

SID 67
I couldnt just let them make you
bring down my degree of difficulty
Im a triple-twisting double back
flip off the high platform not a
swan dive

LINDENMEYER
(proud but frightened)
My God

SID 67

Which God would that be the one
who created me or the one who
created you

(a beat)
In your world the Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away But in my
world the one who gave me life
doesnt have the balls to stop a
couple of bureaucratic assholes
from taking it away

LINDENMEYER
What do you expect me to do put
your character module in my pocket
and just walk you out of here

SID 67
I had something a little different
in mind

(deviously)
Instead of just playing Peeping Tom
with Reilly why dont you get him
to show you what hes been working
on after hours

Lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow then picks up a phone and
dials an extension

LINDENMEYER
(into phone)
Hey Reilly Sheila 32s been
asking for you

CuT TO
PARKER

whose wrists and ankles are cuffed being led into a Prison
Interrogation Room Dr Madison Carter sits at a table a
VISITORS BADGE clipped to her suit A notepad in front of
her

MADISON
(to the Guard)
The cuffs wont be necessary

GUARD
No offense maam but I dont
think thats such a good idea

MADISON

I would like the following three

things in this order your mouth

shut his cuffs off and your ass
outside the door Any questions

The Guard removes Parkers cuffs then exits taking up his
post outside the door The skin around Parkers wrists is
blue where the cuffs dug into his skin

Parker sits across from Madison She places a micro—recorder
in the middle of the table and presses RECORD

PARKER
You actually listen to all those
tapes

MADISON

(wryly)
No I just like the effect a tape
recorder has on you

(a beat)
How you feeling today

PARKER
A little less than yesterday

MADISON
In other words par for the course
(a beat)
How do you feel about the
simulation you participated in
yesterday

PARKER
John died

MADISON

I know I was there I saw the
whole thing

(a beat)
If I was your therapist I would
have advised you against putting
yourself back into that kind of
situation

PARKER
Youre not my therapist Youre
hear to study me Face it — Im

nothing more than a lab rat to you

MADISON
Thats not true Parker

PARKER
If I had died yesterday youd have
already dissected my brain and
analyzed it to see if I carry any
genetic predisposition toward
violence

MADISON
(a beat)
What was going through your mind
when you killed the busboy

PARKER
Not much He was just a computer
program Nothing more

MADISON
You didnt see the expression you
had on your face when you pulled
the trigger But I did

(a beat)
You kind of liked it didnt you
That thrill of going over the edge
again Of taking out an innocent
bystander or two as long as you
got the target

PARKER
Go to hell

MADISON

It was just like before wasnt it
Wasnt it

(a beat)
But you are making progress
Instead of killing seven people to
get the one youre after this time
there was only one other person
involved

PARKER
Enough

The Guard pokes his head in with concern

MADISON
GET OUT

The Guard quickly shuts the door Madison turns to Parker

MADISON (CONTD)
I need to know what snapped in you
What made you capable of it You
have to make me understand

PARKER
I dont have to do anything except
survive And its taking everything
Ive got just to do that

CuT TO
ON A VIRTUAL REALITY MONITOR
inside Lindenmeyers station in LETAC the stunningly
beautiful SHEILA 32 appears In very revealing lingerie

Performing an outrageous strip-tease

SHEILA 32
(seductively)
I hope watching me is as big a turn
on for you as dancing is for me

INSIDE LETAC

Reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he
could touch the contours of Sheila 32s body

REILLY
Oh believe me it is It is

He is so aroused hes shaking Lindenmeyer on the other
hand appears almost uninterested Hes used to the routine

On the monitor Sheila 32 continues her strip-tease
Slowly Sensually Licking her lips Grinding her hips
Putting on quite a show

She removes her top revealing ideal breasts She fondles her
nipples As well as the rest of herself

Lindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching Reilly can barely
control himself

Sheila 32 is very very very good at what she does A
virtuoso stripper Reilly is transfixed Until Lindenmeyer
pushes a button BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens

REILLY
HEY

LINDENMEYER
Shows over unless I get to see
what youve been working on after
hours

REILLY
(paranoid)
I havent been working on anything

LINDENMEYER
(threateningly)
Do I get to see it or not

REILLY
(a beat)
Bastard
(to a monitor)
Sheila dont go anywhere Ill be
right back

He rushes out Sid 67 appears on the various monitors next
to Sheila 32 He kisses her cheek Caresses her body Sheila
32 enjoys the attention

SID 67
Shes some of your finest work
Daryl

LINDENMEYER

All my work is my finest

Sid 67 continues appreciating Sheila 32 As Reilly races
back in the monitors then all go BLACK

Reilly completely out of breath holds a python by its
head He dangles the snake right in front of Lindenmeyers
face Terrifying him

LINDENMEYER
(backing away fast)
Get that fucking thing away from
me

REILLY
(laughing)
Youresuch a wimp

He grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the
snake The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops
moving

But the half still in Reillys hand begins REGENERATING a new
tail Literally growing a new one Lindenmeyer cant believe
his eyes He studies the snake closely

REILLY (CONTD)
Watching your VR people Auto Reset
gave me the idea

LINDENMEYER
(in awe)
Its nano-technology isnt it
Machines the size of molecules

REILLY
(proudly)
Coordinated by polymer neural net

LINDENMEYER
(touching the snake)
t feels so real

REILLY
ts better than real Its
synthetic flesh Synthetic blood
Synthetic organs
(a beat)
ts a physiological machine

LINDENMEYER
(awed)
This is supposed to be years away

REILLY
As far as the public is concerned
it is The reason you got fired
and I got my second demo into
production is Ima lot smarter
than you I never give my best
stuff away

LINDENMEYER
(restraining himself)
How do you kill it

REILLY
Separate the character module from
the neural net

Using Lindenmeyers scissors he cuts off the snakes head
and removes a small character module connected to the base of
the neural net The snake stops moving It dies

REILLY (CONTD)
and you get nano—death
(discarding the snake)
Dont worry Ive got a bunch of
other ones

with you

He exits As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 32 character
module Sid 67 appears on the screen in front of him and
winks

SID 67
You catching my drift

LINDENMEYER
I think I understand what you have
in mind

Peeling the label off the Sid 67 character module
Lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot Sid 67
disappears from the screen

REILLY

opening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes
later Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him
and leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry
As well as a large aquarium full of nano-pythons

LINDENMEYER
You need a maid

REILLY
What I need is a nymphomaniac

He removes a tarp from a large rectangular metallic tank
with a circular window in the middle of it

Clear plastic tubing which branches into hundreds of
increasingly smaller and smaller branches floats in

electrified fluid The tubing is a synthetic human nervous
system

INSIDE REILLYS OFFICE
Reilly turns to Lindenmeyer

REILLY
Wheres the Sheila 32 module

Lindenmeyer hands him the label—less character module Reilly
opens the incubator

INSIDE THE INCUBATOR
Reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the
synthetic nervous system

The polymer neural net instantly crackles with life It grows
around the module Cells (nano-mechanisms) immediately begin
adhering to the tubing Forming the beginnings of a skeletal
architecture

INSIDE REILLYS OFFICE
Lindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window

REILLY
It feeds on what is basically
amniotic fluid

INSIDE PARKERS CRAMPED PRISON CELL

ts night Light is dim His bed is empty The wall next to
it is completely bare except for the five Christmas cards
sent each year by Chief Cox

The other two walls in the cell however look very
different They are completely covered with primitive
paintings — darkly colored surreal images Imagine the
Lascaux cave paintings as works—in-progress Painted by Dali
Except these images were created by Parker Barnes

He kneels in a corner working intensely on another image
Completely lost in concentration His hands his clothing
covered in paint He almost appears to be part of the art
work

The work is intricate It clearly takes Parker a very long
time Which gives him something to do during the nights he is
unable to sleep Which is most of them

He is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the
constant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block Threats of
the ugliest most vile kind The kind Parker has had to live
with every night for the last five years

Pausing to admire his work Parker finally hears the taunts
His face becoming a mixture of frustration guilt and anger
Parker immediately resumes painting

CUT TO
INSIDE REILLYS OFFICE
Reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later
Lindenmeyer sits off to the side looking no less anxious
Its close to 400 AM
THROUGH THE CIRCULAR WINDOW
There is no liquid left in the incubator -- its all been
absorbed All that is visible is the silhouette of a human
form crouched within steam The form stands

INSIDE REILLYS OFFICE

The human form inside incubator opens the hatch Steam pours
out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly

The figure stands within the mist admiring itself Then its
surroundings

Reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father
about to see his newborn child for the first time
Lindenmeyer hangs back

REILLY
(expecting Sheila 32)
Baby what Im gonna do to you

His face drops when Sid 67 steps out of the mist

Completely naked Lindenmeyer smiles proudly Fearfully
Wickedly

REILLY (CONTD)
(to Lindenmeyer)
Who the hell is this

SID 67
My name is Sid Sid 67

He extends his hand as if to shake Then grabs Reilly by the
throat and chokes him Hard

LINDENMEYER
SID — NO

SID 67
What do you expect me to do thank
him

REILLY

(gasping for air)

This isnt possible

SID 67
Sure it is —- and its all thanks

to the many long hours put in by
you and Daryl

He watches Reillys face with curiosity as the life drains
from it A puddle forms beneath him He drops Reillys body
to the floor

SID 67 (CONTD)
(to Lindenmeyer) )
Real instruments are so much more
responsive than virtual ones dont
you think

Lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen The office door is
unlocked and open Watching Sid 67s expression you
realize something isnt quite right

His expression is exaggerated Artificial Only for a moment
but its enough to remind you Sid 67 is not human

The billions of nano-mechanisms which make up his anatomy are
still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion
Sid 67 is literally getting used to his new skin

In various ways throughout his life — be it a wandering
eye or a momentary limp —- you will be reminded that Sid 67
is a synthetic nano-organism unlike anyone has ever seen

A surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 67s attention
Picking up the knife he runs his finger across the razor—
sharp knife blade Cutting himself slightly A drop of blood
appears Sid 67 tastes his (synthetic) blood

SID 67 (CONTD)
Tastes different somehow

He then watches with interest as his wound regenerates
healing itself The scar tissue is slightly off color

SID 67 (CONTD)
I think Im going to like it here

Glancing at Reillys prone body he then SLAMS the office
door in our face

INSIDE A PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM

600 AM Parker clearly just awakened is led into the room
by a guard who then exits Waiting for Parker are Chief of
Police Cox and Elizabeth Deane

PARKER

Youre wasting your time
Im not going to play any more of
your goddam games

Cox
Parker Barnes Id like you to meet
Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane

PARKER
(not shaking hands)
Its too early in the morning for
me to be cordial You got any
coffee

DEANE
I watched your simulation Mr
Barnes Very impressive You know
youre the only one to ever go up
against Sid 67 who is still alive

PARKER
Only because I got pulled out
early

DEANE
Nobody else ever got anywhere near
him Nobody else understands him
like you do

Parker looking at her incredulously moves his index finger
circularly as in get on with it already Cox opens a folder
and shows Parker several PHOTOGRAPHS of Reilly or what was
left of him

Cox
These were taken inside LETAC an
hour ago Pretty pictures arent
they

PARKER
Ive seen worse

Cox
Name was Clyde Reilly Hardware

PARKER
What happens if I cant catch him

DEANE
If Sid 67 hasnt killed you we

sentence

PARKER
How do you know I wont run

The most decorated cop in the
history of L A P D Special

The photograph is in black and white But as we MOVE IN
CLOSER it takes on color As well as comes to life Then
distorting Becoming surreal Resembling one of the images
from Parkers cell Then mutating into something else

INTERCUT WITH
PARKERS EYES

darting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues
dreaming You now realize you are seeing what he is seeing

Flashes of color Shapes Mostly blurs A splash of gold
Along with some yellow More images from Parkers cell Both
taking feminine form One adult one child

This is Parker with his wife and
daughter Beautiful young family

anarchists Parker was closing in
on

Melancholy turns violent Glimpses of weapons Death
Explosions Death Blood Death Caskets Tombstones Images
moving so fast its hard to tell what they are Nothing
literal

MADISON (V 0 CONTD)
This is what Parkers wife and
daughter looked like after they
were kidnapped and executed

Weapons firing Bombs exploding Images of rage in all its
forms Many of which youve already seen Making one thing
now clear the paintings in Parkers cell represent his life
What he was What he lost And what he is

MADISON (V 0 CONTD)
This is what the cyber anarchists
and two people who just happened to
be in the wrong club at the wrong
time looked like after Parker
finished with them

MADISON
(forcefully)

Letting a lunatic like Parker
Barnes loose in the free world is
like lighting a fuse At some
point he will go off -- you saw
what happened in the simulator The
risk to the public is unacceptably

dangerous

DEANE
Not if youre with him every step
of the way

The man played judge jury and
executioner with eight peoples
lives He lost control and is
capable of doing it again

DEANE

understand the risks involved

qualified to go after Sid 67 than
Barnes And there is nobody who
nows him better than you If a
situation becomes volatile you
will find a way to quell it I have

beautiful suburban home in Toluca Lake which is now a crime
scene 6 PM

REPORTER

(to her camera) )
As L A P D
Officers continue gathering
evidence at this grisly crime
scene you can only ask yourselves
— what kind of lunatic would
commit such unthinkable crimes

Parker and Madison make their way through the curious trying
to see whats going on Several REPORTERS double-take Parker
then quickly instruct their PHOTOGRAPHERS to take shots of

him

Parker and Madison present their identification to the COPS
keeping the curious at bay

COP 1
(recognizing Parker)
Sonofabitch

Parker and Madison continue toward the house Getting an
increasing amount of attention particularly from the other
COPS Some look on with awe Some with disdain But nobody is
in between

MADISON
(quietly to Parker)

You ready for this

PARKER
Dont worry If I cant handle it
Tll just kill everybody

He gives her a brief smile Which Madison does not return
One of the other policemen tentatively approaches Parker

COP 2
Ive always wanted to tell you that
if the same thing happened to me I
would do the exact same thing as
you -- if I had the balls

He extends his hand to Parker who shakes it

COP 3
(to Cop 2)
Then youd be a disgrace to the
badge too

He turns to Parker who is looking right at him Not with
anger Not with any emotion really But its enough to scare
the shit out of Cop 3 who walks away

INSIDE THE SUBURBAN HOME

nvestigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every
device imaginable Parker and Madison survey the scene with
nothing but their eyes

Lying in the middle of the living room are the four victims
the affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive Their

bodies were left in similar condition to Reillys Except
their heads have been interchanged

Parker and Madison turn their attention to a message written
in blood on a wall It reads DEATH TO THE PIGS

MADISON
(knowledgeably)
He was re-enacting Charles Mansons
LaBianca murders

PARKER
Manson didnt kill the first cops
to arrive on the scene

MADISON
Whoever did this wanted to do
Charlie one better — to improve

upon what was already done
PARKER
Charlie You say that like youre
close personal friends

You drive well for somebody who
hasnt done it in five years

He had a twin brother who was a
musical child prodigy who died in
an electrical accident at age
eight Lindenmeyer went into an

INSIDE LINDENMEYERS DUPLEX

Madison races through the broken front door to find Parker
checking his weapon Before she can speak he motions for
Madison to freeze and be silent

Parker hears Something Something moving inside the duplex
His every movement is now that of a predator

Madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse She
does not handle it with confidence Parker shakes his head

MADISON
(quietly)
Youve got a problem with me
carrying a gun

PARKER
Do me one favor — if you shoot at
anything make sure Im nowhere
near it

Parker bolts through the duplex storming into rooms
furiously His movements are aggressive Madison searches
other rooms methodically She is not timid Just
inexperienced in the field

She passes a video camera mounted on a tripod Pointed out
the window at a neighbors bathroom Dozens of cassettes
surround the tripod The labels are dated — covering every
day of the last month

Parker and Madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with
their guns drawn nearly shooting each other Madison puts
down her gun Parker does not The noise persists

PARKER
(looking through his
sight)
Bang

He smiles wickedly and continues on Madison takes a deep
breath then resumes her search Parker and Madison end up

INSIDE LINDENMEYERS HOME OFFICE

INSIDE LINDENMEYERS OFFICE

Looking around the room Madison shakes her head

MADISON

Maybe after they catch him you
should write a book about him

He runs his finger along a book shelf pausing at two books
in particular Their titles are UNDERSTANDING THE CRIMINAL
MIND and CRIMINAL PURSUIT -- A PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDE FOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT They were written by Dr Madison Carter

PARKER (CONTD)
Im surprised you didnt write one
about me

MADISON
Im still working on it

Noticing something on the floor she picks up a bizarre
looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor You read its
name MAESTRO

MADISON (CONTD)
Remember a few years ago when music
schools were using a computerized
teaching tool that accidently
started frying kids brains

PARKER
Ive been in prison remember

MADISON
The government must have figured
there was no better person to
create a psycho than a psycho

PARKER
Just like they figured there was no
better person to catch one

Madison elects not to respond She sits down at the computer
which rests between busts of Beethoven and Mozart and begins
typing at the computer She works with efficiency Knowing
exactly what shes doing She is now in her element

From a shelf Parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice
inserted into a half-eaten pudding cup Then flips through
one of the books written by Madison Only half-interested

Hes part of the mix Sid 67 isa
composite

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

The graphics show you that Sid 12 was a combination of
Charles Manson and Billy the Kid You see what look like two
viruses which represent each criminals psychological
profile attacking each other The result is a molten blob

Berkowitz was added to create Sid 13 A three-way
psychological battle more hostile than the first occurs
Sid 14 adding the terrorist Abu Nidal makes the conflict
even more violent And so on

INSIDE LINDENMEYERS OFFICE

Madison stares at the computer screen in awe Parker flips
through CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid

MADISON
Lindenmeyer put increasingly
complex combinations of criminal
psychological profiles together to
develop the ultimate villain

PARKER
(understanding)
Creating a whole far more dangerous
than the sum of its parts

MADISON
But rather than selecting pieces
from each individual he simply let
the stronger traits of each
individual cannibalize the weaker
ones

She continues opening the files of the higher versions of
Sid Version 59 consists of 67 different profiles The
visualized psychological battle is intense And extremely
violent The 67 version with 183 profiles is even worse

MADISON (CONTD)
Its a good bet a couple of the
dominant personalities teamed up to
overpower the others

(a beat)
The question is which one of the
dominants then finally managed to
take control

Attempting to open the files of the composite profiles
Madison discovers they are protected by encryption

MADISON (CONTD)

Hell let us see the ingredients
that went in but not how the soup
turned out after stirring

Madison scrolls through the list of 183 names stopping at
the name MATHEW GRIMES Alarm registers on her face As
Parker comes over to look over her shoulder she quickly
scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen He
holds the Sid 67 CD-ROM in hand

PARKER
This is getting you pumped up
isnt it This is like the World
Series to you

MADISON
As a matter of fact it is

Parker points to a name on the screen JEFFREY DAHMER

PARKER
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid
carried with him in virtual
reality

MADISON

Dahmer carried the head of one of
his victims in a bowling bag for
over a week Kept it in his locker
while he was at work in a candy
factory

(re Sid 67 CD-ROM)
We need to get a look at Sid 67s
final profile

PARKER
What we need to do is stop playing
with computers and go catch the
son-of-a-bitch before he kills
anybody else

understand what makes him tick

PARKER

ALEXIEV

There is one program with
approximately 13 million lines of

It is thoroughly secured which is
not surprising considering
Lindenmeyer created it

Parker drives through a residential neighborhood 9 PM
Madison points to a house on the right

MADISON
Not this one but the next one The
one with the bicycle out front

Parker stops in front of a modest but well-kept house

PARKER
Ill wait out here

Madison pockets the car keys then reveals a pair of
handcuffs She latches one cuff to the steering wheel and
holds up the other toward Parker

MADISON
Give me your wrist

PARKER
Give me a goddam break Im not
going to go anywhere alone

MADISON
And Im going to make sure of it
(not wavering)
Give me your wrist

Parker relents and holds up his wrist Madison places the
cuff around it then gets out of the car

OUTSIDE MADISONS HOUSE

Madison walks up the steps to the front porch She is
immediately intercepted by her daughter KARIN 7 who bursts
out of the front door and leaps into her arms

KARIN
Mommys home Mommys home

Karins BABY-SITTER opens the door for Madison as she carries
her daughter inside

Parker stares from squad car in surprise Even disbelief He
had no idea Madison was a mother

Moments later Karin comes back out and sits on the front
steps Staring at Parker With fascination Curiosity
Wondering who this strange man is and why hes sitting ina
police car outside her house But not saying a word

Parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation
with her A multitude of expressions passing over his face as
memories of his own daughter flash through his mind

CUT TO
INSIDE MADISONS BEDROOM
Madison sits at a desk typing quickly at a computer Via

modem she connects with the L A P D Criminal Library
She rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES who was the
leader of a cult of cyber anarchists He was known as the
Charles Manson of technological terrorism

ON HER COMPUTER SCREEN

From both newspaper ARTICLES and news FOOTAGE the following
information about him becomes clear

Grimes was an expert at media manipulation He delighted in
publicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way The Mayor
of Los Angeles Bob Bennett who offered increasingly higher
rewards for Grimes capture was Grimes primary nemesis

LAPD Special Investigations Division Officer Parker
Barnes managed to stop Grimes from killing Mayor Bennett
Grimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating Parker with false
leads and lawsuits

You see footage of a woman lying dead in an alley A note is
pinned to her clothing The note reads HEY PARKER THIS
ONES FOR YOU

Grimes then kidnapped Parkers wife and daughter Parker
located the group in a club but only in time to witness
their deaths Parker then killed everybody in the club
including the six cult members and two completely innocent
people

INSIDE HER BEDROOM
Madison stares gravely into the screen

MADISON
Grimes you better not be the
dominant

CUT TO
OUTSIDE MADISONS HOUSE
Parker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence
He smiles Then she smiles She wiggles her nose Then so
does he
Madison comes out wearing fresh clothing then kisses her
daughter good night As Madison goes to the squad car Karin
waves good-bye to Parker He does the same Karins
babysitter then leads her back inside the house
INSIDE PARKERS SQUAD CAR

Madison gets in immediately noticing the handcuffs dangling
from the steering wheel Parker has been free the entire
time

PARKER
Told you I wasnt going to go
anywhere

MADISON

How did you get your hand out

As she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel Parker
wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face

PARKER
Sometimes I like being part
machine

Annoyed Madison tosses him the car keys He starts the
engine and drives

PARKER (CONTD)
Why didnt you tell me you had a
daughter

MADISON
I prefer keeping my professional
life separate from my personal
life

PARKER
(a beat)
Shes beautiful you know

MADISON
Thank-you
(a beat)
Her name is Karin

She turns on the police radio

PARKER
Want to tell me the real reason we
stopped at your house

I told you it was on the way and I
wanted to change clothes

Sid 67 is no longer bound by his
programming

PARKER
What does that mean

MADISON
Now that hes in the real world
there are no longer limitations on
his behavior like there were in
virtual reality Sid is going to
evolve

PARKER
Sounds to me like a well-educated
way of saying you have no idea what
to do next

MADISON
What I do know is that whatever
hes becoming Sid 67 is going to
be even worse than he was before

PARKER

Then all we can do is stay mobile
and alert Hes got to make a move
sometime and weve got to be ready
when he does

Welcome to police work You better

He turns up the police radio

INSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB

Sid 67 has separated the patrons into four separate groups
older men and woman and younger men and woman All are
frozen in their seats with fear

Sid 67 points his gun at one group then another waving his
arm as if he were a conductor and as if his gun were a
baton Sid 67 clearly enjoys this game of terror He
delights in the patrons fear and revels in his power over
them
SID 67

Good Very good Nice
(pointing at a woman)
You -- in the middle -- dont hold

back Give it to me
He fires his gun just above her head She SCREAMS in terror

SID 67 (CONTD)
Thats better

He continues aiming his gun from face to face seeking ever
increasing emotional responses from his instruments A guy
entering the bar does a quick about face Gone by the time
Sid 67 glances at the door

SID 67

PARKER
Relax I know what you meant

MADISON

PARKER

while

Madison stops herself from speaking It isnt easy for her
Parker cracks a faint smile YOU HEAR the police radio

changes instantly Dramatically

SID 67

Sid 67 spins around and fires twice before he can finish his
sentence Both Cops receive IDENTICAL wounds in their
shooting arms reminding you of the wounds Parker and John
first received in the opening virtual reality sequence

Sid 67 takes a bow as if on stage

SID 67
Thank you ladies and gentlemen
youve been a real pleasure

As he walks toward the exit he admires himself in the mirror
behind the bar Sid 67 has never seen his own image in the
real world before He likes what he sees

WITHOUT CARE for the innocent MOTORISTS nearby They SCREAM
in absolute terror but remain unharmed Physically anyway
Parker gives up the chase of Sid 67s vehicle and runs in
the other direction Toward Madison as she rounds the corner
in their squad car

INSIDE PARKERS VEHICLE

He opens the drivers side door and shoves Madison over

MADISON
What the hells going on

PARKER
This is my area of expertise

He jumps behind the wheel flooring the accelerator Speeding
through the already frightened motorists Madison is pinned
to the back of her seat Looking out the window she looks at
the motorists
MADISON
(with concern)
What did you do to those people

PARKER
Nothing

ON THE STREET

Parkers vehicle speeds through city streets Gaining ground
on Sid 67

Parker stops for nothing Not for red lights Not for
gridlock When the street becomes impassable he veers onto
the sidewalk

INSIDE PARKERS VEHICLE

Parkers eyes are locked to the road with fierce
determination Madisons eyes are a mixture of fear and
excitement She holds onto the door handle for dear life

PARKER
Being on the streets a little
different than sitting in an office
all day isnt it

MADISON
(gritting her teeth)

PARKER
Whats the problem

MADISON

BOOM That was Sid 67 shooting their front left tire Parker
loses control of the vehicle

ON THE STREET

Parkers vehicle SLAMS into a car stopped in front of them

PARKER
Authority still makes me nervous

They come to a fork one tunnel goes to eastwest trains the
other to northsouth

MADISON
Which way

PARKER
Both

He races down the tunnel to the northsouth trains Madison
heads down the other Her determination beginning to win out
over her inexperience

PARKER

hesitates at the escalator leading to the south-bound side of
the tracks

Further down the tunnel is the escalator to the north—bound
trains Parker chooses the escalator closest to him

ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM

Passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted
above them Except for Parker who scans the crowd Then
across the tracks

ON THE NORTH-BOUND PLATFORM

In the entire crowd there is only one person not watching
the TV screen He is watching Parker Through his gun sight
Sid 67 pulls the trigger BOOM
ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM

Parker dives to the ground just avoiding the bullet He
scrambles behind a pillar for protection Only to see the guy
standing behind him wasnt as lucky

ON THE EAST-BOUND PLATFORM

Madison hears the gunshot ECHO through the station Which
scares the already-terrified fans trying to get away from
Dodger Stadium Chaos is rapidly becoming Pandemonium

Passengers rush in every direction Some are screaming Some
are crying Nobody knows who fired the shot Or where to go
But everyone is going somewhere

ncluding Sid 67 who makes his way through the flurry of
movement toward the up escalator It is difficult to keep
sight of him

PARKER

moves toward the edge of the platform aiming his gun across
the tracks Those around him quickly back away

PARKER
(yelling)
Everybody get down

Only about half the passengers on the north—bound side can
hear him above the screaming already going on Sid 67 is
nowhere to be seen

PARKER (CONTD)
(screaming)

GET DOWN

The rest of the passengers hit the deck except for a COLLEGE
STUDENT listening to music on headphones He is riding the
escalator up Sid 67 stands behind him using the student as
a shield

PARKER S POV

As Sid 67 ascends slight portions of his body are
momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the
music coming from his headphones Parker does NOT have a
clean shot

In 10 seconds Sid 67 will disappear from view completely
and Parker will have no shot at all A momentary sliver of
Sid 67 becomes visible An inch-and-a-half at most

PARKER
doesnt hesitate He lines up his shot and pulls the trigger
ON THE NORTH-BOUND UP ESCALATOR

The college student standing in front of Sid 67 gets winged
in the shoulder Not a serious wound but a painful one just
the same

The bullet must have hit bone because it deflected upon
impact missing Sid 67 entirely

The student drops to the escalator screaming in pain Sid
67 crouches beside him

SID 67

PARKER

fires again Repeatedly Moving closer and closer to the edge
of the platform trying to get a better angle while he still

has a shot

Parker moves to the very edge of the platform His arm
extended out over it Completely oblivious to

THE SUBWAY TRAIN
rocketing into the station toward the south-bound platform

MADISON

leaps off the descending escalator on the south—bound side
and rushes to Parker

She pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him Had
his arm still been raised Parker would have lost his arma

They tumble to the floor A PASSENGER rushes to Madison

Parker

PASSENGER 1
(pointing to Parker)
Lady you gotta stop him Hes gone

PASSENGER 2
He just shot an innocent bystander

MADISON
(forcefully to Parker)
What were you shooting at

PASSENGER 1
He did — I saw it

PASSENGER 2

PARKER
(to Madison)
Sids getting away

He heads toward the up escalator His back now to Madison
She aims her gun at him

MADISON
Parker -— stop STOP Dont make me
shoot you—

PARKER

(not looking back)
If youre gonna do it better do it
now

He keeps right on going up the escalator
MADISON

lines up her shot Hands shaking With both fear and
determination Her finger presses down on the triggerbut
she cant do it

MADISON
Dammit

She chases after him
INSIDE THE NORTHSOUTH TUNNEL

Madison looks in both directions as she gets off the
escalator Parker is nowhere to be seen

Moving toward her slowly is the wounded college student who
clutches his bleeding shoulder He is shivering Going into
shock Madison goes to him taking off his headphones

MADISON
Let me help you

He collapses in her arms

COLLEGE STUDENT
(delirious)
What did I doI didnt do
anything

Clearly versed in emergency medical treatment Madison
attends to his wound Parker returns

PARKER
(breathlessly)
I lost him

COLLEGE STUDENT
GET HIM AWAY FROM ME GET HIM AWAY

MADISON
(furiously)
Call 9-1-1 Wait for me above
ground
CUT TO

OUTSIDE OF THE SUBWAY STATION

30 minutes later The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has
subsided Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged
College Student to an ambulance

Madison goes to Parker who sits quietly by himself Elbows
on his knees Head between his hands Staring at the cement
between his feet

MADISON
(angrily)
Do you have any idea the trauma you
put that kid through

Parker doesnt respond All around them a cacophony of news
broadcasts is heard From passing cars From boom boxes From
portable TVs Over and over you hear what Sid 67 had said
while killing the woman in Dodger Stadium

SID 67 (V 0)
(recorded)
Hey Parker this ones for you
Hey Parker this ones for you

As Parker raises his head slowly you realize you are looking
at the face of a wild animal Eyes rabid Jaw clenched Pure
anger Violence about to erupt Without fear Without guilt
The beast within has been unleashed

PARKER
(in a whisper)
Thats Grimes

Madison backs away in fear Parker rises gradually

PARKER (CONTD)
(voice slowly rising) The man who
killed my wifewho killed my
daughterwho ruined my life used
to taunt me with that line

Parker advances toward Madison who continues backing away

PARKER (CONTD)
(exploding)
Grimes is back Hes back Hes
come back

MADISON
(standing her ground) No Grimes
isnt back Hes only one part of
Sid Sid 67 is a hell of a lot
worse than Grimes ever was

(a beat)
Get a hold of yourself

She tries to grab him by the shoulders Parker blocks her
arms away

PARKER
(going nose—-to—nose)
But hes in there And you knew it
didnt you Didnt you

She tries to back away but backs herself against a light
pole Madison has nowhere to go Parker grabs her by the
collar and shoves her against the pole Hard

PARKER (CONTD)
(hysterical)
God you fucking know-it-all
Youve known all along and didnt

PARKER (CONTD)
tell me Why Were you afraid Id
lose it Go over the edge Huh
Is that what you were afraid of

A prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to them
fast Two of the Prison Guards met earlier jump out of the
transport advancing on Parker Their weapons aimed at his
head

GUARD
Hands up Now

Parker slowly raises his hands in the air A Guard relieves
him of his weapon

MADISON
(recovering)
Whats going on

GUARD
Hes going back where he belongs

Deane and Cox step out of the police vehicle

DEANE

(to Madison)
You were right Dr Carter Letting
a lunatic like Barnes loose in the
real world did pose an unacceptably
dangerous risk to the public

(glancing at Cox)
I should have never tried to solve
one problem by allowing the
creation of another

(to Madison)
Chief Cox will give you a ride back
to the station You will provide
him with any and all information
you have developed thus far

(to Parker)
Enjoy the rest of your sentence
Mr Barnes

She exits Cox and Parker stand facing each other Cox wishes
there was something he could do Parker looks completely out
of it Cox extends his hand After a moment Parker takes it
But his mind is way off elsewhere

GUARD
(forcefully to Parker)
Lets go

Madison looks on as Parker is herded roughly into the back of
the prison transport

MADISON
Parker

Parker shuts her up with a look There is nothing that can be
said The prison transport doors are SLAMMED shut The
vehicle takes off

CuT TO
INSIDE COXS POLICE VEHICLE

Cox and Madison head back toward L A P D Headquarters
They are in mid-conversation

MADISON
(with regret)
I should have told him

Cox
Dont blame yourself In your
shoes I dont think I would have
told Parker either
(a beat)
So do you think Grimes has become
the dominant personality

MADISON
Im not sure My guess is thats
what Sid wants us to think
Cox
(a beat)
You think hes smart

MADISON
Captain Im afraid of how smart
Sid 67 is
(a beat)
But Im even more afraid of whats
hes becoming

CUT TO
THE PRISON TRANSPORT
comes to a stop at a traffic light
INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

Parker sits alone in the darkness Motionless Until the
sound of TWO GUNSHOTS piercing the transports front
windshield SHATTERS the silence

PARKER
What the hells going on

He scrambles to the front of the compartment pressing his
face against the steel mesh of the four—inch portal

HIS POV -- LOOKING THROUGH PORTAL

Two bullet holes are visible in the windshield The two
Prison Guards lie dead in their seats Sid 67s eyes appear
looking directly at you Hes smiling

SID 67
(neighborly)
Hey old buddy old pal good to
see you again

INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT

Parker goes absolutely berserk Viciously punching the steel
mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his
knuckles is shredded

PARKER
Youmotherfucker IM GOING TO
KILL You

SID 67
Now is that any way to talk to an
old buddy I mean just because Im
carrying around the joy of killing
your family inside me doesnt mean
we cant be friends

PARKER
GRIMES YOURE DEAD

He savagely hurls himself against his confines Bone vs
metal Dont try this at home

SID 67
Im sorry the party youre trying
to reach is not answering Is there
anyone else you would like to talk
to

PARKER
DEAD YOU HEAR ME

SID 67
(a beat)
You really are pathetic you know
that Mathew Grimes is only one
letter in my alphabet He is
nothing compared to me

Parker is completely spent Mentally and physically He
slumps in a corner Out of breath Bleeding Sore All he can
do is stare out through the portals mesh at Sid 67

SID 67 (CONTD)

You could say thank-you you know
Im giving you your freedom short—
lived though it may be

(a beat)
A little known fact about the
locater implants prison inmates now
receive upon release is that they
contain a pinhead capsule of neural
toxin
The satellite they use to track you
can also trigger release of the
toxin with microwaves After
transmission the implants host
dies within 30 seconds

(a beat)
It wont take long for them to get
your termination authorized once
they learn of your escape Now who
would you rather go after killer

them or me
He releases the rear door lock
ON THE STREET

Parker bursts out of the back of the Prison Transport
charging after Sid 67 Who is nowhere to be seen Parker
runs in one direction Then the other And changes his mind
again He literally does not know which way to turn

PARKER
Shit

CuT TO
INSIDE A CONFERENCE ROOM IN L A P D HEADQUARTERS

An AIDE rushes through the door to Cox whos briefing Deane
and Wallace on what he has learned

AIDE
Parker Barnes just escaped from the
prison transport Both of the
guards are dead

The Aide exits

Cox
(to Deane)
Barnes wouldnt kill two innocent
guards
DEANE

He would slaughter eight people
sitting in a room but not two
prison guards

Cox
Do I need to remind you what
happened to his wife To his
daughter
(with conviction)
I will stake my reputation that
Barnes didnt kill those guards

DEANE
You already have staked your
reputation
(a beat)
Mayor Bennett and I have been
friends a long time Since Grimes
tried to kill him it doesnt take
a rocket scientist to come to the
conclusion that Sid 67 might go
after him too

WALLACE
On-line and at your disposal

DEANE

INSIDE MADISONS BEDROOM

Madison enters wearily late afternoon Exhausted from the
events of the last two days she starts to undress Her
clothing is filthy So is her skin She could use a good
shower and a better massage

Madison examines the various cuts and bruises shes received
along the way Not exactly war wounds but to somebody used
to sitting behind a desk they are

She absentmindedly turns on the television then goes into
her bathroom Madison looks at her face in the mirror Shes
looked better After splashing cold water on her face she
comes to the same conclusion

Madison takes two aspirin And then two more Wishing they
would take effect immediately Finally hearing the news on

the TV her entire demeanor changes instantly

Madison rushes in front of the television to see a report of
Parkers escape from the prison transport

MADISON
Oh shit

Grabbing a handful of clothes she bolts urgently out the
door

CUT TO

speeding recklessly through city streets in her car She
doesnt stop for red lights Not for grid-lock Not for

Ignoring the warnings of several COPS walking toward their
vehicles Madison speeds toward the front entrance She
barely stops in time SCREEEECH

INSIDE L A P D HEADQUARTERS

Madison races through the bustling facility Looking for
somebody She finally finds Cox coming out of his office

MADISON
(urgently)
There is no way Parker killed those
guards No way

Cox
I think we both know who did
(a beat)
Whats so urgent

MADISON
I need your help--

Taking him by the arm she leads him into an elevator going
down just before its doors close

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

The look on Coxs face tells you Madison has explained the
situation to him He is furious

COx
Why didnt anybody tell me
MADISON
I dont set policy
(a beat)
You have the key

He takes a security key out of his pocket and uses it to gain
access to a subterranean floor

Cox
(angrily)
This is a police department Ill
be damned if this is going to go on
without my knowledge

They exit quickly Cox leads Madison
INSIDE A POWER SUPPLY ROOM

Cox leads in Madison and takes her to the subterranean power
supply He points to the floors numerous circuit breakers

Cox
Give me 30 seconds then flip every
switch you can reach

MADISON
Got it

INSIDE THE LOCATER TRANSMISSION ROOM

The room is still under construction Wallace stands behind a
TECHNICIAN sitting at a console in front of a massive
electronic map tracking several convicts including Parker
The technician is typing in an elaborate termination code

TECHNICIAN
Who are we going to fry

WALLACE
Just an unrepentant criminal who is
apparently going to die froma
previously undiagnosed brain tumor

Cox enters concerning Wallace

WALLACE (CONTD)
What are you doing here sir

Cox
Just paying my last respects

He surveys the electronic map locating Parker Just as the
lights go BLACK Wallace and the technician immediately
panic

WALLACE
What happened

TECHNICIAN
I dont know Weve lost all power

Cox
The heats been causing brown outs
all over the city Get above ground
until its restored

Wallace and the technician rush out of the room up the
emergency stairs Cox sets to work ripping out the consoles

Madison and Cox wind their way to him through obstacle
course of tombstones Parker stands as they arrive He is
wiped out There is no emotion left in him

MADISON
We know you didnt kill those
guards

PARKER
Theyre going to fry me for it
anyway

Cox
Nobodys going to fry anybody

He approaches holding the Circuits he ripped out of the
Locator Transmission Room

Cox
(re circuits)
Dont worry they have no idea
where you are

PARKER
You son-of—a-bitch How could you
let them put the implant in my
head How

MADISON
He didnt know about the neural
toxin
(a beat)
I did
PARKER

(matter-of-factly) You knew the
entire time Can you give me one
good reason why I shouldnt kill
you right now

Cox
She saved your life Parker She
didnt have to but she did

PARKER
(turning to Madison)
Then I guess were even

MADISON
(a beat)
How did you find out about the
toxin
PARKER

Sid 67 told me after he killed the
two guards He suggested I kill you
rather than him

MADISON
Youre not capable of it

PARKER
I pose an unacceptable danger to
the public remember

MADISON
I was wrong
(a beat)
And I was wrong not to tell you
Grimes was part of Sid I should
have told you I wont make the
same mistake again

She means it Parker turns away looking at his wifes

Parker turns toward him slowly Emotion beginning to return

PARKER AND MADISON

survey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of
pedestrians two blocks away Both are disguised in hats and
different clothing You dont immediately recognize them

MADISON
The rallys a little obvious as a
target dont you think

PARKER
I told you before Grimes liked to
be obvious

MADISON
Sid 67 isnt Grimes

PARKER
Part of him is

Various faces in the crowd on the sidewalk In the vehicles
passing on the street On the bridge crossing the street down
the block further away from the hotel

MADISON (V 0)
If we find Sid Lindenmeyer wont
be far behind

PARKER (V 0)
Think hes keeping track of his

MADISON (V 0)
That or living through him

puts down his binoculars Madison does not

He scans the bridge Finally settling on Sid 67 who is
talking on a payphone

ON THE STREET
Parker looks up from his binoculars Impressed

PARKER
Nice work

MADISON
(a beat)
Thanks

They move briskly down the block toward the bridge Quickly
climbing a set of stairs

ON A ROOFTOP

Parker and Madisons movement catches the attention of
several snipers
SNIPER 1
Well look who we have here

SNIPER 2
(into radio)
Parker Barnes is heading south
toward the bridge If anybody can
get a clean shot at him take it

COX

hears the order over his radio headset He races toward the
bridge As do a dozen other cops

ON THE BRIDGE
Sid 67 talks into the payphone

SID 67
Be a reporter — figure it out for
yourself All Im going to tell you
is that at 800 tomorrow night I
will become legendary

PARKER AND MADISON

reach the top of the stairs Sid 67 remains on the phone
his back toward Parker and Madison They split-up winding
their way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus

As the bus pulls to the stop the awaiting passengers move
toward the opening doors Obscuring Parkers view of the
payphone

Parker shoves his way through the crowd only to see Sid 67
holding Madison in front of him his gun to her head Parker
trains his weapon at Sid 67 He doesnt have a clean shot

SID 67
(to Parker)
Brings back memories doesnt it

THROUGH A SNIPERS RIFLE SCOPE

Parkers chest is put into the cross-hairs as the bus pulls
away from the stop He is focused on Parker and Parker only

THE SNIPER

is some 300 yards away on a rooftop His rifle is mounted on
a tripod His aim is perfectly steady
SNIPER
(into his radio headset)
Say good-bye Parker Barnes

Parker stands frozen staring at Sid 67 through his gun
sight Looking for just an inch of him to stick out from
behind Madisons terrified face

SID 67
(to Parker)
I wouldnt pull the trigger if I
were you—

PARKER
Whys that

Cox advances toward Sid 67 from the side of the bridge
Coxs gun out and ready His finger on the trigger

Cox
Hey Sid what were you planning on
doing with the C-4

Sid 67 turns his head in surprise toward Cox as a rifle is
FIRED in the distance Cox steps directly in the snipers
line-of-fire and takes the bullet meant for Parker through
the chest Cox drops to the bridge

PARKER
NOoOOOOO

He rushes to Cox Parker drops to his knees cradling Coxs
head Cox isnt long for this earth Looking up to Parker he
tries to talk But nothing comes out

PARKER (CONTD)
(compassionately)
Dont worry I know I know

Coxs eyes roll back in his head Parker then closes them and
gently lays his head on the sidewalk

Parker turns his head toward Sid 67 whos released Madison
and is jumping over a railing to the street 20 feet below
Parker rushes to the railing

HIS POV
Sid 67 lands on top of a garbage
truck passing beneath the bridge
The garbage truck disappears

Parker ignores them He bolts across the street moving in
the same direction as the bus below Through speeding
traffic

Bullets fly Parker keeps charging Right in front of a
moving van barreling across the bridge The cops lose sight
of Parker

CoP 5
Think he made it

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

Parker dives onto the sidewalk avoiding the speeding van by
inches Getting to his feet he launches himself up and over
the railing

ON THE STREET

The garbage truck passes beneath Parker as he leaps from the
bridge

ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

Parker lands on the back of the truck Right next the opening
and-closing steel jaws of the trucks massive trash
compactor His gun tumbles from his hand falling to the
street

Sid 67 dives on top of Parker putting him flat on his
stomach And his face against the steel teeth Sid 67 chokes
Parker Hard

SID 67
I have to tell you I do enjoy you
Parker I really dont want to have
to kill you

The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea
whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck

CUT TO

THE DOZEN OF COPS
who had been on the bridge charging down the steps after the

garbage truck which can no longer be seen

Madison walks calmly behind them Scanning the crowd Looking

for Lindenmeyer Her every instinct telling her hes here

must be

He

She spots him Veering from the direction the cops headed in
Madison casually wades into the crowd She takes out her

weapon and stops behind Lindenmeyer Even in disguise
looks familiar Madison puts her gun against his back

MADISON
(whispering into his ear)
I figured youd show up sooner or
later

CUT TO

ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

he

Parker and Sid 67 continue battling next to the compactors
lethal jaws The machine makes an awful grinding sound Not
unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 67 are making The fight is

primal Savage And moving at 30 miles-per-hour

PARKER
What C-4was Cox talking about

SID 67
Let me put it to you this way
whether Im hereor whether Im
notIm leaving an indelible mark
on the world tomorrow night

PARKER
Where did you plant the C-4

He should concentrate more on fighting and less on asking

questions because hes losing Parker takes a wicked shot to

the face and then the groin Sid 67 holds Parkers head

between the compactors jaws Which are closing

With every last ounce of effort he has Parker hurls his legs
up into Sid 67 Which throws Sid 67 into the compactor

The steel jaws immediately close in on Sid 67 who
frantically tries to climb out He gets his hands out
his head But thats about it

Without emphasizing graphic detail Sid 67 is decapitated

Then
His lifeless body drops back into the compactor

His head tumbles to the street The force of the impact
causes the Sid 67 character module to separate from the
neural net

The character module scatters into the street Parker
immediately jumps off the truck after it

ON THE STREET

Parkers landing isnt pretty Finally getting to his feet
he sees the Sid 67 character module is about to be run over

Parker dives for it nearly getting run over himself

The approaching car SCREECHES to a halt next to him Its
driven by Lindenmeyer At gunpoint Madison sits behind him
her gun to his head

WHAM The car behind them obviously wasnt prepared to stop
so quickly The bumpers of the two cars are now intertwined
Neither vehicle will be going anywhere soon

Madison pulls Lindenmeyer roughly out of the car She drags
him to Parker who is still on his knees clutching the Sid
67 character module SIRENS approach in the distance

MADISON
(to Parker)
Find out anything

PARKER
A bombs going off tomorrow night
but I have no idea where

LINDENMEYER
(a beat)
There is only one way to get any
more information out of Sid 67

They scan the area for a new mode of transport And find one
stopped at a dumpster down the block the garbage truck

OUTSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK

Parker quickly explains the situation to the sanitation
worker while Madison motions Lindenmeyer into the cab with
her gun As Parker climbs up to her Madison shuts the door
to give them a moment of privacy

MADISON
Can I ask you something

PARKER
(with a smile)
You mean theres something you
havent asked me

MADISON

(a beat)
Youve already fulfilled the terms
of your pardon You stopped Sid 67
and youve got his module Youre
free to go — right now

(a beat)
Why are you going to do this

PARKER
You dont know

MADISON
(shaking her head)
Thats why Im asking

PARKER
Because this pain—in-the-ass

helped me understand what Im
capable of And what Im not
(a beat)

And better than anyone else I am
capable of stopping Sid 67

CuT TO
ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

Parker lands on the back of the truck Right next the
opening—and—closing steel jaws of the trucks massive trash
compactor His gun tumbles from his hand falling to the
street

This sequence is IDENTICAL to the one you previously
witnessed It is as if weve jumped back in time

Sid 67 dives on top of Parker putting him flat on his
stomach And his face against the steel teeth Sid 67 chokes
Parker Hard

SID 67
I have to tell you I do enjoy you
Parker I really dont want to have
to kill you
The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea
whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck

Parker and Sid 67 battle next to the compactors lethal

PARKER
Where did you plant the C-4

He should concentrate more on fighting and less on asking
questions because hes losing Parker takes a wicked shot to
the face and but then blocks the anticipated shot to his
gun

Sid 67 still manages to put Parkers head between the
compactors jaws Which are closing

With every last ounce of effort he has Parker hurls his legs
up into Sid 67 Which throws Sid 67 into the compactor

Sid 67 frantically tries to climb out of the compactor as
the steel jaws close in on him He gets his hands out Then
his head

Except Parker now does something different Just before Sid
67 is decapitated Parker jams a metal rod between the
compactors steel teeth Then grabs Sid 67 by the throat

PARKER
(fiercely)
You cant die until you tell me
where the C-4 is Where is it

SID 67
(choking)
Mysecret

He SLAMS the back of his head into Parkers nose Breaking
it Parker reels back in pain
Sid 67 squeezes out from within the steel teeth The jagged
metal cutting into him striping him with blood The blood
then begins to retract Sid 67s wounds once again heal
themselves

SID 67 (CONTD)
Too bad you cant regenerate

As the truck slows at an intersection he jumps to the
street Parker goes after him Still in excruciating pain WE
PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is

ON A MONITOR

The scene continues seamlessly As you may now be guessing
the monitor is connected to the simulator

INSIDE LINDENMEYERS STATION IN LETAC

Parker lies unconscious on a bed He is connected to the
simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull
cap just like he was before

The Sid 67 character module is plugged into the systems
main console Lindenmeyer sits at the controls Madison next
to him her gun aimed at Lindenmeyers head

They are both watching Parker chase Sid 67 on the monitor in
front of them Parker continues experiencing intolerable
pain A clock reads 400 AM They are the only ones inside
the entire facility

LINDENMEYER
I told you this would work By
setting back the clocks he has
absolutely no idea hes in virtual
reality He still thinks hes in
the real world

MADISON
(a beat)
Whats wrong with Parker

LINDENMEYER
(innocently)
How should I know

MADISON
(getting an idea)

Show me his physical sensory level

She clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel
against Lindenmeyers ear He does as told On a panel by the
console you read PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL SENSORY LEVEL 670

LINDENMEYER
I wonder how that

MADISON (CONTD)
Turn it down

Lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100
ON A MONITOR

Parker immediately returns back to normal His pace picks up
He starts closing the gap between him and Sid 67 as he races
into a shopping mall

CuT TO
INSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL

The place is a seven-story mecca of shopping An atrium
allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh
Sid 67 rushes up the escalators Going up to the second
floor Then the third

Parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator
Throwing people out of his way
ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR

which is also the highest Sid 67 veers out of view Parker
races up the final steps to the seventh floor Sid 67 is
nowhere to be seen

Parker searches methodically Efficiently He finally spots
Sid 67 Who has Parkers head lined-up perfectly in his gun
sight Parker is a sitting duck BOOM

Parker dives behind AFFLUENT SHOPPER 21 who takes a bullet
in his ascot Parker quickly grabs him and uses his body as
a shield against Sid 67s constant gunfire until Parker
arrives behind a marble column

SID 67
(surprised at Parkers
ruthlessness)
We really arent that different
are we

What he cannot see is that behind the column Affluent
Shopper 21 is Auto Resetting Parker puts his gun to the
shoppers head

PARKER
(whispering)
Dont move and dont make a sound

Got it

Affluent Shopper 21 nods his head repeatedly Parker
collects himself behind the column then pivots out from
behind it Firing in Sid 67s direction Each bullet finds
its mark

Absorbing the blows Sid 67 backs up against the atrium
railing Taking one final shot he falls backward Over the

Sid 67 tumbles through the atrium Out of control
Speeding toward the ground seven floors below

SID 67S POV

The sense of momentum is exhilarating And terrifying If you
get dizzy easily close your eyes

FROM THE FIRST FLOOR

Sid 67 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you
A 200 pound rock WHAM

He lands face down in the marble floor The impact is bone—
crushing Sid 67 does not move

Until he begins to regenerate His fluids begin returning to
his body His bones regaining proper form Within seconds
his body appears as good as new

(Technically because this is VR1 the proper term would be
Auto Reset But since Sid 67 thinks hes in the real world
regenerating is what he thinks hes doing)

Sid 67 stands dusting himself off
SID 67
Man what a rush
(yelling up to Parker)

Adios amigo

Grabbing his gun he takes off out of the lobby
ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR
Parker retrieves his gun then bolts down the escalators

CUT TO
INSIDE LETAC
Madison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen Madison still
has her gun trained on Lindenmeyer who notices a WARNING
LIGHT start to flash He turns to Parkers unconscious body

lying on the bed Lindenmeyer looks concerned

MADISON
Whats wrong

Lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console

LINDENMEYER
Hes developing a hemisphere
imbalance

MADISON

Talk so I can understand

LINDENMEYER
If I dont adjust the level of
neural information each side of his
brain is receiving he wont be
able to walk when I take him out of
VR

MADISON
Then fix it

As Lindenmeyer moves to Parker Madison stays right with him
Her gun aimed at Lindenmeyers head Lindenmeyer carefully
removes one of the neural connectors from Parkers skull cap
Before removing another he looks for a safe place to put the
connector

LINDENMEYER
I need you to hold this It cant
get any dirt on it

Madison is reluctant but doesnt know what else to do
Lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free
hand

LINDENMEYER (CONT D)
All you have to do is hold the
needle at the base Just make sure
not to jab yourself with the
point

She clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun
with her right Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector
from Parkers skull

Holding this second needle at the base Lindenmeyer makes
several adjustments on the neural management computer then
moves slowly back to Madison

LINDENMEYER (CONTD)
Hand me the connector nice and

He suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madisons right
forearm Madison has no time to react 10000 volts of
electricity instantly courses through her body

Madison drops to the floor unconscious The needle she had
been holding falls from her grasp breaking the circuit She
stops being electrocuted Which saves her life

LINDENMEYER (CONT D)
(as Sid 67 had said)
God some people are stupid

He sits back down at the simulators main console and starts
to type commands On the monitor Parker is visible exiting
the shopping mall

CUT TO
OUTSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL

Parker races out the door BOOM That was left knee cap He
tumbles to the street His gun flying from his hand

Parker crawls desperately toward his weapon But not fast
enough Sid 67 arrives at the weapon first

SID 67
So close and yet so far

He kicks the weapon down the sidewalk then points his gun at
Parkers head

SID 67 (CONTD)
Its really too bad you have to
miss the Grand Finale

PARKER
I thought you liked me being in the
audience Dont you want me to see
it

Sid 67 pauses to think about it

SID 67
(considering the idea)
You know I do want you to see it

He shoots Parker in his other knee cap rendering both of his
legs useless

SID 67 (CONTD)
I want you to have a birds eye
view

OUTSIDE THE NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED HOLLYWOOD TOWER

A 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of
earthquakes 630 PM

ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

The view is incredible You can see from the Pacific to
downtown From LAX to the Hollywood Bowl Smog must be
getting better in the near future

Sid 67 ties Parker to a chair at the roofs very edge He is
facing downtown Including the Biltmore Hotel the location
of Mayor Bennetts Re-Election Rally

SID 67
There you go — best seat in the
house

PARKER

(with some surprise)
You are going after Mayor Bennett

SID 67
Lets just say Im sending a very
clear message to his Re-Election
Rally

He walks toward an open stairway door behind them

PARKER
Arent you going to watch with me

SID 67
Ive got some final preparations to
take care of— Checking his watch
he stops suddenly

ON HIS WATCH
Time is moving backwards Literally
ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

Sid 67 pauses then goes over to Parker and checks his
watch It is also moving backwards A smile of realization
spreads slowly across Sid 67s face as he admires the
beautiful sky above him

SID 67
(as if to God)
Thank-you Daryl
(turning to Parker)
You had me going for quite a while
there sport

PARKER
What are you talking about

SID 67
I really did think I was still in
reality At least until now
(looking upward)
Beam me up Scotty

His body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes Its electronic
particles form into an amorphous cloud Which disappears from
view

PARKER
(yelling)
Madison get me out of here
MADISON

Lindenmeyer watches Parker scream on the monitor Madison
remains unconscious on the floor behind him

LINDENMEYER
(to the monitor)
Shes taking a nap at the moment

He types a set of instructions into the console and hits
ENTER

LINDENMEYER (CONT D)
But dont worry You wont be alone
for very long Fairly soon youll
be dead

He removes the Sid 67 character module from its slot and
exits the station

ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

One side of Parkers chair gradually starts to rise Parker
looks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath
his chair This could only happen in virtual reality

In a matter of minutes he is going to be thrown over the
roofs edge The next stop is 693 feet down

INSIDE LETAC

Parkers screams for help ECHO throughout the facility But
there is no one there to hear him

OUTSIDE LETAC

The garbage truck is parked in a loading dock Lindenmeyer
climbs awkwardly onto the truck then into the compactor

INSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR

Lindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 67s
headless body The polymer neural net visible within its
neck Lindenmeyer inserts Sid 67s character module into its
gelatinous base But nothing happens

LINDENMEYER
Come on live Live

The synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life
Growing around the module Forming the beginnings of a new
head Literally

CUT TO
PARKER

sitting precariously on the increasingly-uneven roof of the
Hollywood Tower in virtual reality Unable to break free of
his binds he rocks the chair onto its side

He and the chair fall to the roof which will keep him from
falling to his death for another minute if hes lucky

Madison still unconscious on the floor finally stirs Maybe
Parkers screaming is finally reaching her Or at least
starting to

CuT TO
INSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR

Lindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 67 grows a new head
right before your eyes Youve never seen anything like it

Sid 67s resulting head is slightly off center His skin
tone isnt perfect nor is his color but at least its
functional Sid 67 admires himself in a broken mirror

SID 67
I am beautiful arent I

LINDENMEYER
Of course you are

Sid 67 wades through the trash toward Lindenmeyer

SID 67
How can I ever thank-you for
bringing me back to life a second
time Daryl

LINDENMEYER
Help me get out of here

SID 67
Glad to

He reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand then grabs him by
the throat Choking him Lindenmeyer cant believe what is
happening

LINDENMEYER

(gagging)
Whatare you doing

Sid 67 takes Lindenmeyers face gently in his hands

SID 67
You made me a composite of 183 of
the most vicious people who ever
lived

What do you think Im doing

LINDENMEYER
Im begging youplease dont kill

He looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison
She is no longer there Sid 67 begins searching for her

He passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be
seen clinging for life

SID 67 (CONTD)
(to the monitor)
Hang in there Parker

On the monitor Parker looks all around him trying to
determine the voices origin

Madison crawls out of Lindenmeyers station Sid 67 just
catches sight of her and goes after her

INSIDE LETAC

Madison crawls into a darkened engineers station and hides
She is still very dizzy And trying to keep the sound of her
breathing to a minimum

Sid 67 enters quietly A hunter on the prowl Moving very
slowly Then lunging very swiftly He continues the hunt

If Madison is discovered she doesnt have a prayer Her
heart pounds Her forehead perspires Sid 67 is getting
closer

Sid 67 checks inside closets Cabinets Anywhere large
enough for a human being to fit He is practically standing
over her Looking Listening

SID 67
How does it feel to know youre
going to die What are you thinking
about

Lights in the building suddenly come on Several engineers
can be heard entering Its 8 AM — the start of a new day
The facility is quickly becoming populated

After giving one last look around Sid 67 reluctantly gives
up the hunt and exits Madison does not move until she is

certain Sid 67 has left the building

PARKER (0S)

Madison scrambles out of her hiding place

PARKER

finally losing his grip on the roof of the Hollywood Tower in

Madison bursts through the partition around Lindenmeyers
station Sacrificing her body Without regard for pain

who is dressed in a tuxedo knocking on the door to Guest
Conductors Dressing Room

GUEST CONDUCTOR (0 5)
(German accent)
It wont do any good to rush me I
need my time to prepare myself

The door is opened by the GUEST CONDUCTOR who is dressed in
a tuxedo as well as large earrings His hair is long and
red His complexion is pale nearly white And his eyes are
piercing green You might describe this look as punk meets
classical

GUEST CONDUCTOR
(annoyed beyond belief)
Are you just going to stand there
or do you want something

Shaking with concentration Sid 67 turns his hair red
(Nano—-organisms can do this as well as the following) He
then grabs his hair and pulls it out extending it to the
exact length of the guest conductors

Sid 67 then changes his complexion to match the conductors
As well as his eye color and other facial features The
Guest Conductor cant believe his eyes

By the time Sid 67 is finished modifying himself he may not
be an exact duplicate of the guest conductor but even his
mother would have to look twice
SID 67
Its show time

He shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room
Sid 67 follows him in revealing a suppressed 38 He SLAMS

THE GUEST CONDUCTOR
whose back is to the audience leading the orchestra in a
truly magnificent performance of Tchaikovskys Fifth Symphony
inside the Hollywood Bowl
The Guest Conductor waves his baton wildly Passionately
Brilliantly Getting the absolute best from the members of

the orchestra

The musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to
their musical limit

As the Guest Conductor turns to the next page of his sheet
music on the podium you notice seven small HIGH-FREQUENCY
SENSORS above an upcoming musical measure

The sensors are wired together When the seven notes are
played in sequence an electrical pulse will be triggered
down the wires which run down the side of the podium beneath
the stage

BENEATH THE STAGE

The wires connect to several crates of C-—4 positioned beneath
the orchestra These seven notes will be the last notes these
musicians ever play

inches of mowing down several people Madison and Parker bolt

be described bizarre frightening and not something you
would ever like to see when you look in the mirror

The musicians stare at Sid 67 and then at Parker and
Madison with concerned confused silence Which is broken by
Parkers gunfire

Ducking behind the podium Sid 67 desperately tries to
rewire the sensors to trigger manually Without luck He
takes his 38 out of his jacket and starts firing

Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl Audience
members run in every direction

The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives but
eep their instruments with them Even the oboist

Preventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots
at Sid 67

Sid 67 bolts down into the crowd Madison cannot get off a
clean shot Neither can Parker He aims but does NOT fire
He and Madison struggle through the crowd after him

OUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

Parker and Madison just catch a glimpse of Sid 67 as he
rushes up the entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway Parker
and Madison bolt after him

ON THE HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY

Parker and Madison race past the cars waiting to merge into
what is effectively a parking lot As is normal for this
thoroughfare traffic is at a standstill

Sid 67 is nowhere to be seen Parker and Madison split—up
wading through different lanes of traffic Startling the
already frustrated motorists Who roll up their windows Lock
their doors And some of whom reveal weapons of their own
Madison pauses listening She has no idea that Sid 67 steps
behind her WHAM He cold cocks her with the butt of his gun
Madison crumples to the street

Which now leaves Parker a clean shot at Sid 67s head BOOM
BOOM Two hits Two head wounds Sid 67 falls behind a
truck losing his weapon

Before Sid 67s wounds have finished regenerating Parker is
already on top of him

PARKER
(neighborly)
Hey old buddy old pal good to
see you again

He empties his clip into Sid 67 then discards the gun As
Sid 67s wounds heal themselves Parker pounds him
mercilessly

SID 67

YouruinedIM GOING TO KILL

you
Trading blows he manages to get to his feet

PARKER

Now is that any way to talk to an
old friend

SID 67
(exploding)
BARNES YOURE DEAD

He knocks Parker back with a good shot to the face then
disappears around a van

Parker continues the hunt Quietly Carefully Tension grows
in the silence that follows

He carefully makes his way around a truck Only to see Sid
67 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head WHAM

Parker is knocked on his ass Daze4 Blood streams down his
cheek He staggers to his feet blocking another blow with
his arm Which SNAPS the wood in two

Parker grabs one of the boards He battles with Sid 67

The fight between Parker and Sid 67 is intense Exhausting
Parker gives it everything he has

Madison appears behind Parker holding his gun She wavers
having trouble keeping her balance She has even more trouble
aiming her weapon

MADISON
Hey Parker

She moves around trying to get a clean shot at Sid 67
Which she does not have

PARKER
Hows your pulse

MADISON

As he raises his two-by—four high over Parkers head Madison
pulls the trigger smoothly

IN SLOW MOTION you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel
of her gun And penetrates Sid 67s skull between the eyes
and exits out the back of his head

Sid 67 collapses on the ground next to Parker

MADISON
What do we do now

PARKER
You wont want to watch Turn
around

She does so Parker reaches OUT OF FRAME to remove the Sid
67 character module from within his skull Then reveals the
character module in hand
MADISON
What should we do with it

Glancing in the flatbed of a truck Parker gets an idea and
knocks on the drivers window As the DRIVER rolls down his
window classic ROCK and ROLL MUSIC can be heard from inside

PARKER
Mind if I borrow a couple of your
tools for a second

DRIVER
Be my guest

Parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck
He offers one to Madison

PARKER
Care to join me

Madison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer Parker drops
the Sid 67 character module onto the pavement And together
they start pounding the shit out of it WHAM WHAM In
perfect time with the music Which the driver cranks even
louder As we ROLL CREDITS
