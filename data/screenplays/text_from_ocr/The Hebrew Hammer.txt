PAST

EXT PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

We start on JESUS ON A CRUCIFIX and then violently CRANE
down to reveal MORDECHAI a timid little Hasidic boy
standing nervously at the foot of the statue

Behind Morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase HANUKKAH

4 HOMOS scrawled across it He clutches his Sandy Koufax
lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance Hes

quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age
We see a menacing EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the

Superimposed over the picture are the words ST PETER
PAUL AND MARY PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

Mordechai takes a deep breath and walks towards the

EXT SCHOOLYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by FOUR
GENTILE CHILDREN

GENTILE BOY 1
Hey Mordechai look I dropped a penny

He drops a penny The other children cackle
The Gentile Girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels

GENTILE GIRL 1

T

Hey Mordechai Want a bagel
Gentile Boy 1 feigns choking

GENTILE BOY 2
Hey Jew nose save some oxygen for us

More laughter Morty attempts to take it all in stride We
PUSH into GENTILE GIRL 2 a severe looking puritanically
dressed child as she turns to face the camera
GENTILE GIRL 2

Hey Morty my mom says that unless your

people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as

your lord and savior youre all going to

burn in hell

Dead silence The other children exchange Now that went a
little over the line looks

The silence is broken by the sound of the SCHOOLBELL
gathers himself and walks off

INT CLASSROOM - LATER

As Morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we
a tinny version of the song Dreidel dreidel dreidel

He tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a DREIDEL He
looks at his gift and then looks off-screen We PAN with

look to reveal
A group of Christian children congregating around a large
garishly decorated Christmas tree A very Vegas Merry

Christmas sign flashes as a larger-than-life HI-FI version

the Christmas song Jingle Bells blares The children
festively slap high fives as they open their presents

We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Boy 1 enamored with
brand new ATC motorbike
We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Girl 1 She wears an

Love Jesus T-shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow
affixed to its head in her arms It licks her on the face

We cut back to Mordechai He looks down at his pathetic
excuse for a present Hes on the verge of tears
Gentile Boy 1 calls to Mordechai as he drives his ATC

GENTILE BOY 1
Hey everybody Look what Mordechai got
Nice spinning top Morty

The other children take notice of Mordechais gift and
begin
to laugh

Mordechai is crushed MRS HIGHSMITH (40s) an incredibly
Waspy teacher puts down her copy of Modern WASP and
appears genuinely concerned by the teasing Mordechai has
weathered She walks over to comfort him

MRS HIGHSMITH
Now now class lets not make fun of
Mordechais spinning top We need to all
learn the importance of tolerance and
understanding Isnt that right
Mordechai

MORDECHAI
Yes Mrs Highsmith

MRS HIGHSMITH
So class in honor of Mordechais special
day Id like for all of us to wish Morty
a heartfelt Merry

She looks to Mordechai for confirmation on the word

MRS HIGHSMITH (CONTD)
(Stumbling)
Cha-noo-kuh Day 7

In unison the class attempts to repeat the words but all
suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems

MRS HIGHSMITH (CONTD)
Very good class I hope youve all
learned an important lesson today Just
because Mordechais people are different
from usjust because they might appear
strange to us with their furry hats
their beady eyes and their long

sideburnsnot to mention their bizarre
customs and unnecessarily guttural funny
sounding namesjust because they

control all of the worlds money yet are
too cheap to buy their children anything
better than spinning tops for presents
does not mean that we cant learn to
respect and love them as our equals

She squeezes his cheek

MRS HIGHSMITH (CONTD)
Happy Chanoo-juah-kah Day 7 Morty

He spins it and we hold on the spinning top for a few
as Morty stares at in wonderment

Suddenly a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame
and smashes the little dreidel Mordechai slowly looks up

A menacing SANTA CLAUS gives him the finger and exits
as we hear him sadistically laugh 0S the words Ho ho

through the screen line by line spinning into place to

a Star Of David The title The Hebrew Hammer SLAMS into

TITLE CARD HANUKKAH PRESENT
EXT THE CHOOD - DAY

We start CLOSE on a gift wrapped Hanukkah present We pull
back a bit as MORDECHAI JEFFERSON CARVER AKA THE

HAMMER a baaad Jewish brother spins the package in his
as he saunters down the street past a latke stand Hes a

Semitic super stud straight out of a 70s Blaxploitation
flick He tosses the gift to MACCABEE a young Hasidic

HAMMER
Happy Hanukkah Maccabee
Macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the
a Hebrew Hammer action figure He beams

We cut back to the Hammer as he smiles back From 0C we
hear Maccabee say
MACCABEE (0C)

The Hammer smiles back and walks off frame

ANOTHER PART OF THE CHOOD

We begin on the Hammers black boots and slowly TILT up as
we

DOLLY back with him

The Hammer passes a line of THREE JEWISH PRINCESSES who
swoon

as he passes

He stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads
100

KOSHER MEAT We PUSH into his CLOSE UP as he blows them
all

a kiss

The pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony

The Hammer winks back

An OLD WOMAN calls to the Hammer from the window of a
second

story flat

OLD WOMAN
Hammer why dont you come eat by us for
Shabat My Miriam is all grown up now
God willing you should settle down and
marry

We punch in to a CLOSE UP of a demure Miriam as the Hammer
takes stock of the goods She is an atrociously ugly girl
wearing orthodontic headgear and bespectacled with a pair
oversized librarians glasses

The Hammer shakes off his wave of nausea

HAMMER
Thanks for the invite Mrs Kleinman but
right now G dash ds the only one for me

OLD WOMAN
I can dig it

The Hammer continues on down the street The old woman and
Miriam are framed in the BG
OLD WOMAN (CONTD)

The Hammer stops for a second and smiles at the

compliment
HAMMER
(To himself)
Shabat Shalom

EXT GHETTO ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
Some TEENAGE GENTILE BOYS play keep away with a yarmulke
belonging to SHLOMO another young Hasidic kid
SHLOMO
Give it back Give me back my yarmulke
TEENAGE GENTILE
Hey Teddy throw me the frisbee
TEDDY (the non-speaking teen Gentile) throws the yarmulke
and we FOLLOW it as it spins towards another TEENAGE
GENTILE
The other Teenage Gentile excitedly extends his hands to
catch but right before it reaches him another hand comes
into frame and snatches it He looks up and we cut to
his
POV as we tilt up to reveal The Hammer He looks pretty
damn

big and pissed off from this angle
The Teenage Gentile begins to shake and stammer

TEENAGE GENTILE (CONTD)
Wewe were going to give it back I

HAMMER

TEENAGE GENTILE
No no ItIts not like that We were

The two run off
The Hammer looks down to Shlomo His spirit seems broken

HAMMER

SHLOMO

bother praying to one god

HAMMER
Hey hey Be proud of who you are Youre
a bad bold big-nosed biblical brother

SHLOMO

HAMMER

The Hammer pounds his fist into his chest ala the Black
Panthers The kid returns the gesture

SHLOMO

The Hammer points at him as he leaves

HAMMER
Stay Jewish

EXT HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

The Hammer walks up the stairs and past the sign
advertising
his office

The Hammer theme music winds down punctuated with Shaft-

like
brass hits However the brass hits become incredibly
overblown and extraneous

The Hammer walks back into frame from the stairway to his
office He looks around strangely for the source of the
music

LATER

TIKKVA (Late 30s) the Hammers very nasaly Laawng Island

YET TBD TRANSITION

EXT NORTH POLE - DAY

An establishing shot of Santas Workshop The lettering
NORTH POLE - SANTAS WORKSHOP is superimposed over the
picture

INT SANTAS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

SANTA CLAUS (0S)
I want to start by thanking all of you
for pulling yourselves away from the
workshop to make this emergency meeting
I know its the busiest time of the year
for all of you so Ill try and be brief

As Santa speaks we begin on a painting of a meek and
frightened looking Santa Claus His eyes look fearfully to
his right Below the picture frame is a plaque reading
Nick the Nervous 1871-1941 we continue a slow DOLLY to

right on to the next picture

We see another Santa Claus much more treacherous in his
appearance His eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture

Santa to his left The plaque below his picture read St
Nick The Nasty 1941-1970
We continue our DOLLY to the right finally ending on a
painting of a jolly portly Santa Below his picture the
plaque reads St Nick The Nice 1970-Christmas Present

We cut to a WIDE shot of a Conference Room The same nice

Santa Claus from the last picture addresses a handful of

ELVES Two reindeer flank Santa on either side Their

nameplates hang from their necks - BLITZEN and
RUDOLPH

At the other end of the table from Santa sits his son
DAMIAN

quite a nasty looking man

SANTA CLAUS (CONTD)
My father often referred to as St Nick
The Nasty was a tyrannical man He was
obsessed with making Christmas the only
holiday anyone could celebrate before the
New Year
Since his death Ive prided myself on
ensuring that the Christmas season is one
of tolerance and understanding between
all races and religions Its always been
my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa
deserve the same respect as Christmas

Damian whispers to an elf on his right hand side and then
makes the JERKING OFF motion with his hand

SANTA CLAUS (CONTD)
Lights please

As Rudolphs nose dims so do the lights in the room
Santa

picks up a remote in his hand and turns on a SLIDE

PROJECTOR

SANTA CLAUS (CONTD)
Over the course of my career as Santa
Claus Ive made it my mission to ensure
that Jews Christians and African
Americans could all observe their
respective holidays in harmony

We see a slide of THE HEBREW HAMMER an African American
man

(Mohammed) and Santa Claus arm in arm below a banner ina
mall reading HAPPY HOLIDAYS

SANTA CLAUS (CONTD)
I was responsible for pushing the Happy
Holidays Ordinance in which all Merry
Christmas signage was replaced by the
Trans-relgious and inoffensive phrase
Happy Holidays

We see another slide in which an assembly of
SCHOOLCHILDREN
are singing

SANTA CLAUS (CONTD)
It was nearly a decade ago in
conjunction with our friends in the
Jewish and African American communities
that I supported a bill that mandated
that Dreidel dreidel dreidel and Im
dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa be taught
and sung in elementary schools along with
the Christmas standards Frosty The
Snowman and Deck The Halls
Which is why upon examination of my
annual naughty and nice list it shocked
me to discover that my own son Damian

Damian preoccupied with the cigarette hes attempting to

light looks up in response to his name

A brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in
front

of him We can see Santa and the reindeer in silhouette on

the slide projection screen behind him

SANTA CLAUS (CONTD)
The heir to the Red Suit could be so
filled with hate

Santa addresses Damian

SANTA CLAUS (CONTD)
Damian when I learned of your ludicrous
scheme to wipe out Hanukkah my first
reaction was one of disgust Now Im
only filled with sadness and
disappointment Disappointed that I
failed to teach you the true meaning of
Christmas What do you have to say for
yourself

We being a SLOW PUSH into Damian as he ponders the

question
The cigarette dangles from his lips

Rudolph nods to Blitzen Blitzen returns the gesture with
nod of acknowledgment
With a slow and measured pace Damian says

DAMIAN
Ho Ho Ho

On the slide projector screen behind Damian we see the
silhouetted images of Blitzen and Rudolph goring Santa
through the chest with their antlers Damian cringes
Blood trickles from Santas mouth and with his last

he utters the words

SANTA CLAUS
Et tu Blitzen

Santa falls out of frame with a thud Standing behind him
with bloodied antlers is Blitzen

Damian walks over to the newly deceased Santa takes his
bloodstained Santas hat and put it on his own head From
this point on in the screenplay Damian will now be
to as SANTA
The elves in the room in various stages of shock stare
their new master in horror
SANTA

What are you fucking midgets looking at

Get back to work We have Hanukkah to

destroy

The hall fills with hushed voices as the various members

of

CHIEF
The Hebrew Hammer No No way After the
way he handled that situation in the West
Bank Hes the only Jew in the world too

Mrs Carver forcefully grabs Esther into an embrace

resembling a bear hug and begins to plaster her with
sloppy

kisses Esther is visibly overwhelmed by it all as the

kissing and embracing continue for a bit too long

Mrs Carver places her tongue into Esthers ear canal as a

sign of affection forcing Esther to break the embrace

to understand is that nothing not even
god himself could convince me to ever
work for them again

ESTHER
But Hanukkahs in dan

The Hammer cuts her off
HAMMER
Not my problem If youll excuse me now
I need to use the bathroom

He stands and leaves

Mrs Carver stares lovingly at Esther
MRS CARVER

But Mrs Carver the fate of Hanukkah
rests solely in his hands Please you

ESTHER
(Confused)

Esther begins to choke again

HAMMER

MRS CARVER

Esther begins to speak but Mrs Carver interrupts

MRS CARVER

So once I started taking two charcoal
pills before I ate the gas cleared
itself right up

Esther plays along

Hanukkah god forbid you should go back
to business school and get an MBA Maybe

This puts the Hammer into a neurotic fit

HAMMER
Oh Oh What So all of a sudden my
saving Hanukkahs not good enough for

The Hammer and Esther scope out the area The Hammer is
disguised terribly consisting of a baseball hat on top of
his Shtreml and a Jesus Fish T-shirt worn over his black
suit Esthers visibly nervous

ESTHER
Any sign of Santa

HAMMER
He must be behind that curtain Relax

appearance of calm You see Esther the
trick to undercover work is to try and
blend in Act as a Gentile would

The two pass a samples booth The FREE SAMPLES WOMAN
solicits
the Hammer

SAMPLES WOMAN

bacon cheeseburger

We get a CU of the burger followed by a CU of the Hammer
Hes mortified but he pulls it together
HAMMER
While I thank you Gentile friend for
your generous offer of that deliciously
unkosher snack I sadly have to decline
for I stuffed myself full of meat and
milk product at a prior lunch engagement

The Sample Woman looks at him strangely as the Hammer and
Esther walk on

ESTHER
Youre good

The two take their place at the end of the line in to see
Santa

Tony performs the two fingered whistle

TONY

The kids all vocalize their disappointment

TONY (CONTD)
Ah dont be like that kids We gotta lot

disapproval

TONY (CONTD)
Hey Hey You want shitty ass presents

Tony spits and grabs his crotch as he turns back around to
take his place in front of the velvet ropes

Esther surveys their place in line Its about fifteen
deep

ESTHER
What are we going to do Were at least
an hour from the front

HAMMER

She puts her hand on Tonys bicep and smiles once again

ESTHER (CONTD)

JIMMY an adorable six year old sits on Santas lap

Girls

Santa snaps his fingers and Bambi and Tawni drape
on either side of the Hammer rubbing his arms erotically
SANTA (CONTD)
Bambi Tawni Id like for you to meet

Mordechai Jefferson Carver
Bambi speaks with a thick Southern drawl
BAMBI
Oh I declare I just love Jewish men
Theyre so sensitive and well read
Esther is clearly jealous
The Hammers enjoying the attention He looks down at

breasts Were talking HUGE obviously augmented boobolas

large crucifix chain hangs around her neck nestled in
between the mounds of silicone We hear the requisite DING

it sparkles
The Hammer is released from the sexual spell of the
Seductress
HAMMER
Sorry Santa I like my women like my

matzah Unleavened

The girls move away from the Hammer Esther smiles at the
Hammers resolve

HAMMER (CONTD)
This is where you go down

Suddenly Tony draws the curtain back
of

just

children

TONY
Hey hurry it up in there We gotta bunch
of kids

He sees the Hammer with his gun pointed at Santas head

TONY (CONTD)
Oh shit

Esther pulls out her piece and points it at Tony

ESTHER

happening Hushed fearful whispers MC Hammer steps out

line and pleads

MC HAMMER

The Hammer does a double take MC Hammer gives a Did I

HAMMER

Santa stands up slowly with his hands raised

SANTA

HAMMER

AN EMPTY SECTION OF THE MALL - MOMENTS LATER

We hold a few beats on a shot of this fairly untrafficked
portion of the mall

Suddenly Esther and the Hammer haul ass around the
running for their lives

A second or two pass and an ANGRY MOB of about twenty
Gentile children round the corner after them Theyre

definitely not in the Christmas spirit

The Hammer and Esther take another turn From the other
direction a SECOND MOB OF CHILDREN head straight at them

The Hammer spots another corridor in front of them

HAMMER

The barely audible sound of a gospelized version of the
Biblical slave song Let My People Go sounds as if its

coming from within the walls of the mall

ESTHER
Shh Shh listen Do you hear that

The Hammer tries to place the source

HAMMER
What is that

Suddenly a panel on the wall slides open to reveal a

The other side of the door is dark but it has a cavernous
feel to it

An elderly Jewish woman HARRIET TUBBELMAN appears from
of the doorway She smokes a corncob pipe

HARRIET TUBBELMAN
Psst Hammer Esther This way Hurry

Harriet escorts the two into the passageway and the door
slides shut behind them

INT CAVERNOUS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an
Its A Small World After All type water ride

Harriet leads Esther and the Hammer into one of the
cars The cars kind of have a baby Moses straw basket

going on The Let My People Go song piped from unseen
speakers is now at full strength

HAMMER
You saved our lives Thank you How can I
ever repay you

HARRIET TUBBELMAN
-My name is Harriet Tubbelman but you
can call me Moses The only payment I ask
Mordechai is that you keep Hanukkah safe
for us all

She hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap
sure

it

check

Two

hear

restraints for Hammer and Esther testing them to make
theyre secure

HARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONTD)
You should be safe from here on out Just
follow the river to its conclusion

She begins to walk away but then catches herself as she
turns back to face them

HARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONTD)
Oh yeah and keep your arms and legs

inside the water craft at all times

HAMMER
Where are we What is this place

She smiles with great pride
HARRIET TUBBELMAN

Welcome to the Underground Jewish

Railroad Just sit back relax and enjoy

the ride
The brakes on the water craft release and the craft makes
way from the loading dock
Wide eyed Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings
Hasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of
Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational yet
oddly entertaining way
The Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to

out the attraction in wonderment

Esther secretly glances at him affectionately Its clear
shes falling for him

We cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down
the river A funkdafied version of the Let My People Go
song FADES UP and over the gospel version from the ride
EXT ALLEY - DAY

We see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall

turnstiles stand directly in front of the door We can

the muffled sounds of the gospel version of Let My People
Go Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase

Now

The door opens and the obnoxiously loud music spills out
into the street The Hammer and Esther exit close the

and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley

HAMMER
That got annoying fairly quickly

ESTHER
Yeah no kidding

A CARNIVAL WORKER stands behind a makeshift Underground
Jewish Railroad booth

CARNIVAL WORKER
Tickets please

The two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets

CARNIVAL WORKER (CONTD)
Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish
Railroad If you plan on returning today
please make sure to get you hands stamped
before you leave the alley

HAMMER
Nah were kosher Thanks though

The two walk past him Esther turns to the Hammer

ESTHER
So now what

Your typical Blaxploitation bar It could easily pass for

Lenox Lounge in Harlem with the exception of the large
menorah shaped sign out front

INT THE GOLDEN MENORAH - CONTINUOUS
We see a bar packed with ORTHODOX JEWS A WALL separating
men and women in the bar runs along the center of the

stopping about ten feet from the stage Signs clearly
demarcate these MEN and WOMEN sections

Onstage a KLEZMER band plays a rendition of a to be
determined 70s funk classic

Esther and the Hammer enter the joint Mid song the
BANDLEADER notices the two walk in

BANDLEADER
Hey The Hebrew Hammer everybody

The Hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment The entire
cheers and applauds

Hammer escorts Esther to a table on the womans side of
wall and then walks around to the other side of the

where he takes a seat opposite the wall from her

The band begins a rousing version of Hava Nagila A good
majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and
begin dancing zealously with one another

Esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the

of the bar

ESTHER
So do you come here often

The Hammer struggles to hear He shouts back to her

HAMMER
What was that

ESTHER
I said do you come here often
HAMMER
Oh Yeah about once a week

ESTHER
What

HAMMER
I said yeah about once a week

ESTHER
Oh

A HASIDIC BAR PATRON approaches the Hammer and smiles

HASIDIC BAR PATRON
Would you like to dance

We get another shot of the men dancing together arm in

arm
on the dance floor
HAMMER
Im okay right now Thanks though
As the Patron leaves JOSHUA another Hasidic man standing
directly behind him takes his place at the Hammers table
JOSHUA
Hey Morty wanna cut a rug
HAMMER
Nah Im good Im kind of here with
somebody
The Hammer motions to the wall Joshua looks as if his
feelings are hurt
JOSHUA
Oh Okay Maybe next time
HAMMER
Yeah Maybe next time Joshua Take it
easy
As Joshua leaves we get a WIDER shot of the Hammers
table

A LONG LINE OF MEN leads up to it

CHAIM FEYGELE an effeminate slick Hasidic man chest hair

spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar
shirt
neck dripping with gold chains steps up to the Hammer
Hes
got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face

CHAIM FEYGELE
Well Shalom there mister

HAMMER
Do we know each other

CHAIM FEYGELE
No but we have mutual friends

Chaim points to the dance floor Another shot of men
dancing
with one another arm in arm

CHAIM FEYGELE
So Morty I just love a man in a black
suit Care to dance

Mordechai is flustered

HAMMER
Uhhh You know Ihave to go to the

The Hammer gets up quickly and leaves

We cut to Esthers side of the wall The Hammer walks
behind
her while she checks out the band on stage

a bit

We begin a SLOW ZOOM back from the two eventually pulling
back far enough to see what Esthers moaning about The

Hammer is

a seriously terrible dancer stepping on her

forcing her into awkward positions etc

We see a CU of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her

yet again

ESTHER
Ouch

Esther pulls herself away from the Hammer

HAMMER
Sorry Im better with men

ESTHER
(Sensually)
Maybe we should try a different kind of
dancing

HAMMER
You mean like disco dancing or doing the

We see a TIGHT MEDIUM SHOT of Esther Her erect nipples

clearly outlined through her blouse Now the Hammers

liberalism

EXT NEW YORK CITYSCAPE - MORNING

The sun rises over the city

INT HAMMERS BEDROOM - MORNING

We start close on the Hammers hand as he screws a light
into his electric Menorah until it glows orange

Esther caresses the Hammers chest as the two enjoy a post
coital cigarette

ESTHER
Wow that was amazing

The Hammer gives her ass a smack and then picks up a
container filled with some kind of WHITE POWDER
He snorts a bit of it off of the Star Of David chain that
hangs from his neck and places the container of white
powder
back in its place by the menorah

Esther is mortified

ESTHER (CONTD)
What did you just snort

HAMMER
Antihistamine Its for my allergies The
capsules make me gassy

She relaxes
HAMMER (CONTD)
You know Ive been thinking about what

Santas got planned for us next Maybe

ESTHER
Your mother was right You do work too

HAMMER (CONTD)
Oh my god Shes become my pimp And

highest bidder

ESTHER
No Its not like that Youre being

He thinks aloud

Judeum An element so rare it exists
only inside the clock itself

base

HAMMER (CONTD)
Lets dance the hora

Santa draws a pistol and with a single shot from his Uzi
the Hammer blows it out of his hand

It lands on the other side of the room Santa looks up
his empty hand

SANTA
Get him boys

Santas Elf Thugs open a CHEST filled with LARGE SUB-

GUNS The chest is labeled HEAVY ARTILLERY With great
difficulty they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out

the box

The Hammer mildly amused watches them
and

towards

his

The Hammer blasts away and the elves scramble for safety
The sound of gunfire is deafening and constant

An Elf sneaks quietly towards Santas gun

Esther walks in through the front door and spots something
OS that gives her cause for concern

Unbeknownst to the Hammer the SNEAKY ELF picks up Santas
gun He raises it at the Hammer ready to fire

ESTHER
Mordechai Behind you

The Hammer turns and nails the elf just in time
Esther gun drawn backs up into frame with the Hammer
the two fire off rounds

HAMMER
What are you doing here

ESTHER
Mordechai I love you I couldnt let you
do this alone

HAMMER
I love you too Im sorry about freaking
out yesterday I was wrong

ESTHER
I forgive you

HAMMER
Go check on the clock Ill finish up

We do another QUICK PUSH into the Hammer as he turns
Tiny Tim
Tiny Tim standing alone with his crutches tucked under
arms looks like a deer caught in headlights

The Hammer grins mischievously

TINY TIM
Uh oh

quickly

ceases

The Hammer begins firing

In SLOW-MOTION Tiny Tim hobbles as fast as he can towards
overturned table gunfire trailing him

Like a pole vaulter with two poles Tiny Tim plants his
crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over
table

He lands directly on top of Santa who cowers underneath

table

SANTA
Get off of me you cripple

TINY TIM
What are we gonna do Hes got us on the

ropes

We DOLLY BACK with the Hammer as he approaches the camera
firing rounds at the table

We cut to the duct taped Hasidic Guards tied to their
One of them frantically nudges the other and motions to
window Fear fills both of their eyes

We see what they see Through the window the SUN is
setting behind the mountains

We cut back to the Hammer The speed with which he shoots
begins to slow

Esther checking the clock for damage calls to him

ESTHER
Whats the matter

HAMMER
I dont know Im feeling kind of tired

We cut back to Santa and Tiny Tim underneath the table We
HEAR the shooting continue to slow until finally it

altogether Santa and Tiny Tim exchange looks

SANTA
Whats going on Whyd he stop
TINY TIM
Maybe he ran out of ammo

SANTA
Take a look

Tiny Tim pokes his head over the table to see

The Hammer and Esther lie together slumped up against the
wall They look exhausted

Tiny Tim drops back below the table

TINY TIM
Well hes kinda just resting in the
corner with his girlfriend

SANTA
Resting

He thinks for a second An idea forms

SANTA (CONTD)
What day is it

TINY TIM
Its Friday

SANTA
What time is it

TINY TIM
I dont know About sundown I guess

Santa makes the connection

SANTA
Why didnt I think of this Its the
Sabbath

A blank look from Tiny Tim

SANTA (CONTD)
The day of rest He cant fight on the
Sabbath Cmon get up Weve got him
beat

The Hammers POV as Santa and his thugs approach him
cautiously

SANTA (CONTD)
Well well well It looks as if the

Hebrew Hammers got a weakness after all

Santa turns to his thugs

SANTA (CONTD)
Finish extracting the Judeum from the
clock
(To Tiny Tim)
Tiny Tim I want you to introduce the
Hebrew Hammer to the Christmas spirit

Another blank look from Tiny Tim

TINY TIM
You want me to be nice to him for no
apparent reason whatsoever buy him
clothing hell never wear and for just
one day of the year pretend to forgive

him for all the horrible things he did to

me as a young boy when my mommy wasnt
looking

SANTA
No dipshit I want you to kill him

He thinks about it

TINY TIM
Oh

SANTA
Santas gonna take the sled back to the

North Pole and celebrate his victory with

his new stocking stuffer

Santa grabs Esther and attempts to pull her up

The Hammer

holds on tightly to her other hand but isnt strong

enough
to resist Santas might Esthers hand is pulled from his
firm grip and Santa takes her into his arms
HAMMER
Esther
ESTHER
Mordechai
Santa forces her out the front door leaving Tiny Tim
alone

with the Hammer OS we hear the sound of Santas Sled

taking off
to

TO

TINY TIM
Take a look Hammer The clocks already
beginning to power down

We see a shot of the elves pumping out the Judeum from the
clock and then tilt up to reveal its face

The dial slowly spins past Yom Kippur Passover
Hanukkah Purim and then finally the Macys 50 Off
Spring Sale

Tiny Tim raises his gun point blank at the Hammer

TINY TIM (CONTD)
Ah Whats the matter No more snappy one
liners

It seems all is lost when
We hear the sounds of a whole lot of GUNS being COCKED

Tiny Tim turns around to see the ENTIRE KWANZAA LIBERATION
FRONT with their guns raised at him Jamal standing next

Mohammed flashes Tiny Tim a smile

STAR OF DAVID WIPE

TO

EXT NORTH POLE - DAY

The Hammer and Mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff

overlooking Santas Workshop With his binoculars the
Hammer

scopes out the compound below

BINOCULAR POV - Instead of your standard two circles
filling

the screen we see the world through a pair of Star Of
Davids The place resembles the exterior of an industrial
warehouse with two Elves on guard with guns

HAMMER
Its gonna be tough but the back
entrance looks like our best bet

MOHAMMED
I wanted to ask you how were you able to
pinpoint the exact location of Santas
workshop Weve been trying to gain that
piece of surveillance for years

The Hammer puts the binoculars down

HAMMER
This is the year 5734 Its time the boys
at the KLF got into the 58th century Let
me show you something

The Hammer pulls out a LAPTOP COMPUTER
HAMMER (CONTD)
The JDL supplies all its agents with this
state of the art device called a laptop
computator

MOHAMMED
Cool Whats it do

HAMMER
Now this might get a bit technical but
try and stay with me Using a highly
sophisticated connection of other
computators called the Internet I can
access surveillance maps villian
biographical information and even sports
scores with a few simple keystrokes of
this electronic typewriter

The Hammer makes a few keystrokes and turns the screen
towards Mo

MOHAMMED
Man thats far out Hey the Jets won

HAMMER
But wait theres more With a few swift
clicks of this hand-computer interface
commonly referred to as a mouse I can
download illicit pornographic material
and even send it along to a friend via a
cyber postal route known as e-mail

Mos interest is seriously peaked

MOHAMMED
Porno Youre tellin me that you can get
porno on that thing

HAMMER
Oh yeah Take a look

The Hammer does some computing
HAMMER (CONTD)
For example heres a picture of your

sister Tawanda getting freaky with a
German Shepard

Mos eyes widen

MOHAMMED
Gettin freaky with a what

out

empathy

and

stands

He grabs the laptop from the Hammer and looks at the

A picture of TAWANDA making out with a GERMAN man decked

in lederhosen on a rural German hillside The two are
surrounded by sheep

Mo gives a sigh of relief

MOHAMMED (CONTD)
Oy vey thats almost as bad Thats
Tawanda getting freaky with a notorious
white supremacist

Mo goes for the keyboard

MOHAMMED (CONTD)
Wheres the white out button on this
thing

We get a CU of the ENTER KEY as Mo presses it A SOOTHING
COMPUTERIZED FEMALE VOICE purrs

COMPUTERIZED FEMALE VOICE

Nah forget about it
INT SANTAS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Santa sits at the head of his conference table Tawni and
Bambi sit on his lap A cigarette dangles from his mouth

he holds a giant glass of eggnog in his hand Rudolph

Rudolph equipped with a tray around his neck holding a

antagonistically

Santa puts his cigarette back into his mouth takes a drag
and blows smoke past camera

A huge cloud of smoke blows over Rudolphs face
Santa smiles at his women as we hear Rudolph cough

SANTA (CONTD)
Ho ho ho

Suddenly the two women are pushed from his lap as a SASSY
BLACK PROSTITUTE rises up between his legs from underneath
the table

SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE
Listen motherfucker I already told you
I dont care how much yo ass is payin
me if you call me that one more time
there aint gonna be no more visits down

His ego deflates a bit

SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE

marked

head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something
himself Mo nervously scans the area for guards

MOHAMMED
What are you doing

HAMMER

Just praying to god that we dont kill

ourselves going over this wall
The Hammer unwraps his leather straps and then tosses
high over the wall
The boxes on the straps catch on a pipe The line is
taut and the boxes hold secure against the pipe
The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60s

Batman and Robin television show The Hammer leads the way
while Mo directly behind him has his arms wrapped

around his waist The Hammer stops climbing for a second
turns to him
HAMMER (CONTD)
You know you dont have to hold on to my
waist Youre tied in
Mo releases his arms from the Hammers waist Indeed he
tied in

MOHAMMED
I knew that

The Hammer and Mo drop from the wall onto the ground The
Hammer looks around

No guards in sight In front of them is door clearly
BACK DOOR

MOHAMMED
Well that was easy
Mo heads for the door The Hammer calls to him

HAMMER
Wait Before we enter you need to know
that my research has determined that
Santas compound is wired with the XP
2000 stereo type alarm system

MOHAMMED
A stereo type alarm system

HAMMER
Take a look

The Hammer points to above the door Sure enough there

sit
TWO LARGE STEREO SPEAKERS
MOHAMMED
How do we bypass it
HAMMER
The alarm will trigger if the system
detects any Non-WASP tendencies
inside the building For example if you
were to dribble a basketball or eat
watermelon or use the word dawgthat
is spelled with an aw as opposed to the
letter owithin the confines of this
workshop the alarm would sound
This pisses Mo off
MOHAMMED
Listen cat Ill have you know that I
hate the taste of watermelon and ama
terrible basketball player
HAMMER
Well thats good news for us It means
the system is outdated This should be
easy Cmon
The two enter through the door
INT SANTAS WORKSHOP COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS
The Hammer shuts the door behind them So far so good
Suddenly the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down
the

hall They duck into a corner
The sound of the footsteps passes The Hammer makes the
silent military eyes gesture to Mo by pointing two

fingers
at his eyes indicating for him to check and see if the
coast
is clear
Mo bends out from the corner to look Pennies fall from
his
pockets
MOHAMMED
Its all clear Lets go
The Hammer bends down to pick up the change
HAMMER
Mo I think you dropped some
Mos eyes widen in terror
MOHAMMED
Hammer no
The Hammer picks up the pennies and the ear splitting
alarm
system is triggered Red Lights flash and over the
loudspeakers we hear
LOUDSPEAKERS
Jewdar alert Jewdar alert
Mo and The Hammer start running down the hallway Doors
line
the corridor
The Hammer kicks open one of the doors and enters as it
shuts behind him The camera stays in the hallway with Mo
who looks around nervously From inside the room we can
hear
INTENSE GUNFIRE
The Hammer exits the room
HAMMER
Lets go
The two continue on down the hall The Hammer spots
another

door violently kicks it open and enters Again the door
shuts behind him followed by the sound of more INTENSE

GUNFIRE
The Hammer exits

HAMMER (CONTD)
Cmon lets go

Mo stops and looks at him

MOHAMMED
What are you doing

HAMMER
Offscreen gunfire That Jewish Atomic
Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget
Mo shakes his head in understanding and the two run on
making a hard right out of frame at the corridors end A

beat passes and then we hear MORE INTENSE GUNFIGHTING

ANOTHER CORRIDOR
Mo and the Hammer run into frame Mo points to the other
of the hall

MOHAMMED
Theres Tiny Tim

Tiny Tim spots them and begins to hobble furiously away in
the other direction

MOHAMMED (CONTD)
Ill take Tiny Tim You go find your

woman

Mo runs down the hallway after Tiny Tim The Hammer turns
towards the other direction to find

TWO ELVES on multi-colored MOPEDS comin right for him
The Hammer stands motionless as the Elves gain ground
Right before they reach him the Hammer quickly pulls his
Talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched

clotheslining the two off of their mopeds

The elves are out cold The Hammer admires his work

in his tracks as he spots the Hammer

The two look at one another for a brief moment and then
Santa points at something behind the Hammer

SANTA
Hey whats that over there Is that a
bowl of Matzah Ball soup
The Hammer looks behind him Nothing He turns back to

Santa long gone

HAMMER
Damn

He takes off down the hall after Santa

cut

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Mo catches up to the hobbling Tiny Tim and begins to mock
the manner and speed at which he runs running side by

with him circling around him as he attempts to get away
etc

Realizing that itd be impossible to outrun him Tiny Tim
comes to a stop

Mo trains his pistol on him
MOHAMMED

Now Im gonna do to you what I should

have done earlier
Tiny Tim closes his eyes in anticipation of the worst
Mo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs
off Tiny Tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down
against the wall We PULL AWAY from Tiny Tim as he calls

crucifix a CART OF TOMATOES Feeling confident that the

front of him

The Hammer grabs Santa by his shirt

HAMMER
Wheres my girlfriend Santa

SANTA
I dont have to tell you anything Hammer
Youre gonna have to kill me before I
tell you

The Hammers confused

HAMMER
But if I kill you then youll be dead

Santa thinks about this for a couple seconds

SANTA
Good point

The Hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a

taped to a door directly behind Santa It reads THE ROOM
WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMERS GIRLFRIEND IS

The Hammer grins mischievously at Santa

HAMMER
Dont worry your pretty little head

Hammer fires a single round past camera RED SPLATTERS his
face

We cut to the other side Santa cowers by the cart of
TOMATOES

HAMMER (CONTD)
That was a warning shot

We hear Esther screaming from inside the room

ESTHER (0S)
Mordechai Im in here Help
The Hammer turns towards the sound

Suddenly Santa kicks the Hammers gun out of his hand
and

then draws a pistol from behind his belt and points it at

him

SANTA
Looks like the tables have turned once
again Hammer

More screaming from Esther behind the door

SANTA (CONTD)
And you wont even be able to say goodbye
to your Esther So sad So long
Mordechai Give my father my regards

Santa readies to fire

HAMMER
Wait I didnt want it to come to this
but you leave me no choice I have no
other option but to use the most powerful
weapon in the Jewish arsenal

The Hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as
if
in meditation Santa looks around nervously

SANTA
What are you doing

The Hammer meditates for a bit more Suddenly his eyes
open
and he begins

HAMMER
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole
for this I come to fight you and you
dont even put out anything to nosh on
What kind of arch nemesis are you

SANTA
Hah Jewish guilt Well it wont work on

Esther continues to scream for help This makes the Hammer
even more determined

HAMMER
What sort of host would treat company

in your guest room Im shvitizing from
running around shooting people And my
feet What kind of flooring is this

Its beginning to work on Santa

SANTA

the courtesy to give me a proper hello
when I entered the room What have I ever
done to you to be treated with such
disrespect

Santas a wreck

SANTA

He hands his piece to the Hammer and kneels on the ground
pointing to his head

SANTA (CONTD)

The Hammer begins to untie Joe

JOSEPH LIEBERMAN

Santas a broken man He gets on his knees and inquires
earnestly

they try and get a better look outside
MRS CARVER
I forgot to ask you whod they put in
charge as the new Santa Claus
HAMMER
Since Santa will be living out the rest

and the Jewish Defense League agreed to
make the whole Santa Claus process a
democratic vote Were all very pleased
