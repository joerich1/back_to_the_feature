FADE IN

On motes like meteors dancing streaking particles of light
that rise up against the endless night as we tilt down
revealing--

The flickering flame of a campfire wavering in the wind

EXT VILLAGE - NIGHT - YEAR 2346

Broken-knuckled scab covered hands reach for the warmth of
the fire

ZACHRY
Lornsome night Babbits bawlin’
wind bitin’ t’bone

Zachry (50s) looks old more weathered than aged wearing a
mix of furs and strange futuristic armor

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
Wind like this carries voices
ancestry howlin’ at’cha screaming
their stories all their voices
tied up in’t’one

On his face is a terrible scar a brand burned into his
cheek

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
And out there’s you know who spyin
from the dark Old Georgie and me
crossed paths more times’n I’m
comfy mem’ryn After I’m died no
tellin’ what that fangy devil wont
try to do to me

The fire glints in his eye

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
Listen close and lemme yarn you
‘bout the first time we met eye to
eye

EXT CHATHAM ISLANDS BEACH - DAY - YEAR 1846

MOVING POV ON a trail of footsteps in the sand being
followed by ADAM EWING a lawyer from the city of San
Francisco who appears out of place on the shore of this
Pacific island
EWING (VO)
Thus it was that I made the
acquaintance of Doctor Henry Goose
surgeon of London nobility

The path leads to DR HENRY GOOSE (mid-40’s) his trousers
rolled up sporting an unkempt beard as he shovels and sifts
through the sand

EWING (CONT’D)
Doctor Goose

Goose looks at Ewing eye to eye

GOOSE
And who might you be

EWING
Ewing Adam Ewing Sir Traveling
with the “Prophetess” They told me
I could find you out here Have you
lost something

GOOSE
(a beat then smiles)

Teeth sir are the enameled grails
of the quest at hand This beach
was once a cannibal’s banqueting
hall where the strong gorged on
the weak but the teeth the teeth
sir they spat out as you or I
would expel a cherry stone An
artisan of Piccadilly who fashions
denture sets for the nobility pays
handsomely for human gnashers Do
you know the price a quarter pound
will earn sir

EWING
I confess I do not

GOOSE
Nor shall I enlighten you sir for
‘tis a professional secret
Ahhhhahahaha

The doctor has dentures himself the teeth overly large for
his mouth give him a comedic and paradoxically carnivorous
appearance
INT VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE - DAY - YEAR 1974

LUISA REY (mid 30’s) a feminist from the days when it was an
ideal not a fashion statement talks into her tape recorder

LUISA REY

Question one what secret might be
in Sixsmith’s report that would be
worth killing him for Question
two if in fact someone did kill
him is it reasonable to assume
they would kill again to protect
that secret and if so question
three what the fuck am I doing
here

EXT SWANNEKKE ISLAND BRIDGE - DAY - YEAR 1974

The Beetle rattles toward a small island dominated by a
nuclear power plant cooling tower a man-made volcano blowing
white smoke indifferently across a blue sky

The security booth is besieged by demonstrators wielding
signs that scream “Welcome to Cancer Island” And “Hell No
We Won’t Glow”

She stops in front of the gate and the mirrored shade wearing
GUARD steps over

GUARD
Press pass

LUISA REY
Expecting trouble

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - YEAR 2144

An ENFORCER hands a small wand-like device to the ARCHIVIST
a man in his early thirties

ENFORCER
Any problems sir you just hit this
button

ARCHIVIST
Thank you

The Enforcer leaves them alone The glow panel hums above
them
The Archivist sits across from SONMI-451 a young female
replicant who watches him her magnetic shackles securely
locked to the armrests

He removes the “orison” an egg-shaped recording device from
its case He sets it upright and it begins to spin

ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
On behalf of my Ministry and the
future of Unanimity I want to
thank you for this final interview

Her genetically designed features remain a mask of servile
patience

ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Remember this isn’t an
interrogation or a trial Your
version of the truth is all that
matters

SONMT-451
Truth is singular Its “versions”
are mistruths

The noise of an old typewriter in use cuts into the silence

INT CAVENDISH’S STUDY - EVENING - YEAR 2009

A beautiful English study bookshelves line the walls
Timothy Cavendish an older man is typing his memoir into a
typewriter

CAVENDISH (VO)
While my extensive experience as an
editor has led me to a disdain for
flashbacks and flash forwards and
all such tricksy gimmicks I believe
that if you dear Reader can
extend your patience for just a
moment you will find there is a
Method to this tale of Madness

He pauses considering then sips the last of his wine before
continuing

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
Look I was Dermot Hogginss
publisher not his shrink or his
astrologer the ruddy bloody truth
is I had no idea what the man was
going to do that night
INT LAUGHING CAVALIER HOTEL - DAWN - YEAR 1931

ROBERT FROBISHER (early 20’s) looks as though he has been up
for days He places an envelope carefully on the desk just
above a manuscript entitled “The Cloud Atlas Sextet”

FROBISHER
My Dearest Sixsmith I shot myself
through the roof of my mouth at
four AM this morning with Vyvyan
Ayrs’ Luger

He goes to the bathroom and wraps his head in a towel He
gets into the tub and picks up the Luger pistol

FROBISHER (CONT’D)
A true suicide is a paced
disciplined certainty People
pontificate “suicide is
selfishness” while career
churchmen like Pater call ita
coward’s act typically because they
lack the necessary suffering to
sympathize Couldn’t be further
from the truth suicide takes
tremendous courage

He puts the gun in his mouth
FROBISHER (CONT’D)

Don’t let them say I killed myself

for love Had my infatuations but

we both know in our hearts who is

the sole love of my short bright

life
As he cocks back the hammer and prepares to pull the trigger
we cut to black

FADE OUT

EXT CART TRAIL - DUSK - YEAR 2314

A man and his two sons push an overloaded archaic looking
hand cart along a muddy wooded trail They stop at a ford
along a river bed the sun low in the sky

Helping them without exerting much effort is Zachry who we
recognize though he is a decade younger and does not have
the terrible scar

ZACHRY (VO)
For me all started way back when I
still had mos’ my teeth Me an’
Adam my bro’by law an his two
sons was trekkin back from Honokaa
Market Evenin catched us up
early so we tented on the southly
bank o Slooshas Crossin

Zachry’s brother-in-law Adam and his two sons begin to set
up a makeshift camp

ZACHRY (VO) (CONT’D)
Now Id got diresome hole-spew
that day ‘cos Id ate a gammy dog
leg in Honokaa an I was squattin
in a thicket when suddnwise I felt
the devil’s eyes on me

Zachry defecates in a leafy brush when he feels as though he
is not alone

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
Whos there

The hairs on his neck stand up

CREEPY VOICE
Oh a darky spot youre in friend

ZACHRY
Name yself

Zachry yanks out his weapon

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
I got a blade I have

The voice hisses at him

CREEPY VOICE
Ain’t no blade can protect you from
the True-true

Perched above him wrapped in dusky shadow is OLD GEORGIE a

devil dressed in black tatters and a battered stovepipe hat

his spindly arms and legs unfold from beneath him spider-like
as he stands
ZACHRY
(scared whispers)
Old Georgie

The devil cackles

ZACHRY (VO) (CONT’D)
I knowed the moment he looked me
dead t’eye my soul was stoned

Suddenly Old Georgie LEAPS DOWN at Zachry who screams ---
staggers hiking up his pants and runs away crashing through
the brush straight into a clearing--

Filled with savage-looking tattooed men astride armored
horses KONA RAIDERS

The blood drains from his face as Zachry freezes for a
moment then turns and bolts

They howl as they rear their horses in chase

The underbrush tears at Zachry as he sprints back to his
camp The taunting shrieks of the Kona and the thundering
hooves of horses swirl around him closing fast

Zachry can feel them almost on top of him when his foot gets
caught by a root and he suddenly drops disappearing into a
thick bed of leaves

The horses scream past him

He lets out a breath still shaking from the chase but as the
sounds of the raiders recede he hears their SHOUTS rise
renewed

He realizes he has led the Kona to Adam and his two sons

ZACHRY (VO) (CONT’D)
Now panickin wings your foot but
it muddies your thinkin too so I
rabbited back to camp I jus
followed my instinct without
thinkin thru whatd happen

Zachry scrambles from his hiding place and carefully worms
his way to the edge of the camp

The Kona have surrounded Zachry’s brother-in-law and nephews
hooting at them as they toy with their prey

He watches as Adam swings his axe defensively when the crack
of a bullwhip sends him to his knees
Another crack and the axe is torn from his hands

Zachry lies paralyzed by fear as Old Georgie seems to
materialize from the shadows beside him at first the
malevolent smile is the only thing visible

OLD GEORGIE
Yay stay here Saaaaaaafe here
Ain’t no sense in trying to
help’em Youve said it y’self
Many times ain’t ya “The Weak
are Meat the Strong do Eat” The
True-true what that is No
un‘scapes the True-true

Horror like a hand of ice squeezes Zachry’s heart as the--

KONA CHIEF grabs a handful of Adam’s hair and wrenches back
his head His blade flashes as he slits his throat from ear
to ear

OLD GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Shame but Adam’s too old for
slavin’ Ain’t fit for nuthin’ but
feedin’ worms

His youngest nephew screams and attacks but he his quickly
and violently subdued The older boy tries to protect his
brother but is also bludgeoned into submission

The two boys are thrown over a horse as the Kona prepare to
depart

OLD GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Dem boys a’ headed t’slave markets
Ain’t nuthin’ y’can do t’stop it
“Sides who’s gonna look after your
sister and little Catkin

This thought takes away some of the pain and horror of what
Zachry has just experienced

OLD GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Yay think ‘bout Catkin and Rose
Makes thinkin’ about y’self so much
easier don’t it

The face fades back into the darkness while the smile
lingers dissolving into a patch of leafy crepuscular light

Alone Zachry looks at Adam’s body and begins to weep

INT MISSIONARY SOCIETY - CHATHAM ISLANDS - DAY - YEAR 1846
A contract is being signed

EWING (V0O)
Wednesday 9th of September The
contracts are signed My father-in-
law should be happy

Reverend Horrox sits across from Ewing and finishes the last
signature

EWING (VO) (CONT’D)
All my worrying due to the delay
caused by my failing health seems
fatuous A bit of good fortune--
Doctor Henry Goose had offered to
accompany me back to San Francisco
and treat me How I long for this
journey to end to be home again
to be in Tilda’s arms

Close on a pool of smoking red wax as a seal is pressed into
it Above the seal is the signature of Reverend Giles Horrox
of the London Missionary Society

HORROX
There you are MrEwing As
binding a covenant there can ever
be between men outside the province
of Scripture

EWING
Thank you Reverend Horrox I know
my father-in-law is profoundly
excited about this deal

HORROX
Your father-in-law is a great man
Future generations depend upon men
like him men capable of speaking
the truth

Ewing nods like someone used to living in someone else’s
shadow

INT HORROX DINNING ROOM - NIGHT
Adam Ewing and Goose sup on turtle soup with the Horrox
family and a few members of his clergy
HORROX
When I first encountered Haskell
Moore’s writing its perspicuity
struck me as if delivered through
Divine revelation

Goose slurps his soup

HORROX (CONTD)
Doctor Goose a learned man such as
yourself must be familiar with his
tractus “The Ladder of
Civilization”

GOOSE
I confess Reverend my education
remains a work in progress

HORROX
How providential your choice of
words Doctor for Progress is
precisely the subject
Specifically the kind of Progress
that we see here in Bethlehem Bay
everyday But I’m sure Mr Ewing
would be better at explaining the
work of his father-in-law than I

EWING
Well let’s see It is in essence
a syllogistic exploration of God’s
will

MADAME PARISHIONER
(to Goose)
I couldn’t understand a word of it
Doctor but when the Reverend
explained it in one of his
homilies well the whole parish
felt the presence of our Lord

HORROX
Continue Mr Ewing

Attention shifts to Ewing who sets his spoon down with a
muted clatter against the taurine
1l

EWING
Of course he acknowledges that
Gods Will remains ultimately
unknowable but he suggests that if
the miracles of the Biblical Age
can be interpreted as a
manifestation of His Will then
perhaps that same Hand is
responsible for the miracles of
Progress In this Age he argues
it is Progress that elevates man
towards his Creator not Jacob’s
Ladder but rather “Civilization’s
Ladder” that bears us towards the
Godhead

Madame Parishioner hums in corseted pleasure

HORROX
This explains the advancement of
each race why you have the Anglo-
Saxon at the high-point on the
ladder nearest God and the
“irreclaimable races” such as the
Aboriginal and the African or even
our own Moriori who remain one
rung up from the great ape so
obdurate to Progress and to the
Word of God that no one should be
surprised when one of them slips
off the ladder altogether

GOOSE
You mean extinction

HORROX
Surely a Doctor knows that God’s
Will is often an act of mercy

MADAME PARISHIONER
Amen

Heads are bowed and “amens” mumbled amidst the flickering
candle flames

Goose looks at Ewing who has trouble meeting his gaze

INT IMPERIAL WESTERN HOTEL - DAY - YEAR 1931

The young byronic Frobisher lies entwined with his lover
RUFUS SIXSMITH deep shadows cleaved into the tangle of
sheets frame their coital luminous flesh

On Frobisher’s back just below his shoulder there is a
strange comet-shaped birth mark

FROBISHER (VO)
Sixsmith - I do hope you will be
able to find it in your heart to
forgive me

A terrible pounding on the door jolts the lovers awake

HOTEL HEAVY
Mr Frobisher Mr Robert
Frobisher

Sixsmith starts to the door but Frobisher stops him though
the pounding grows more urgent

HOTEL HEAVY (CONT’D)
The management would like a word
sir Mr Frobisher open this door

Sixsmith looks at Frobisher knowing exactly what is about to
happen his lover’s eyes shine in a way that often requires
an apology

HOTEL HEAVY (CONT’D)
We know you’re in there Mr
Frobisher Please comply A
letter is being drafted to your
father Mr Frobisher

As the pounding continues Frobisher slips on most of his
clothes including a beautiful waistcoat

As he puts it on he smiles at Sixsmith who smiles back
knowing he is about to lose his favorite vest

They stare at one another as if they were the only two people
in the world until Frobisher kisses him one last time

The kiss ends like a spell breaking the pounding even louder
as Frobisher dashes across the room grabs his small bag and--

Leaps out the window

There is a metal shriek of a bending drainpipe which causes
Sixsmith to rush to the window wrapped only in a sheet

Outside Frobisher thuds to a lower roof below then with a
certain awkward aplomb slips down over the eave and drops to
the alley below

He sees Sixsmith watching and he bows as though taking a
final curtain gestures as if he was throwing his heart at
Sixsmith flashes a rakish smile and darts away just as-—-

The door bursts open

FROBISHER (VO)
Hated leaving you like that
Wasn’t the goodbye I had in mind at
all But you more than anyone
understand the precariousness of my
present predicament

Sixsmith smiles with resignation and reaches for his wallet

INT TRAIN CAR - DAY - YEAR 1931

Frobisher writes his letter as the city is smeared with an
impressionist’s brush behind him

FROBISHER (VO)
I’m sure youd remind me I brought
it all upon myself Sixsmith but
shrug off that middle-class chip on
your shoulder and try to stick with
me a little longer

EXT HYDE PARK LONDON - DAY - YEAR 1931
Sixsmith sits on a park bench reading Frobisher’s letter

FROBISHER (VO)
This time it’s going to be
different I swear to you This
time I have a plan In the Belgian
backwaters south of Bruges there
lives a reclusive English composer
named Vyvyan Ayrs You wont have
heard of him because youre a
musical oaf but hes one of the
greats

INT DOVER TRAIN STATION - DAY - YEAR 1931

Frobisher gets off the train and heads for the exit

FROBISHER (VO)
He hasnt produced any new work
since the early twenties due to
illness - but the Times review of
last week’s performance of his
Secular Magnificat referred to a
drawer full of unfinished works

EXT HYDE PARK LONDON - DAY - YEAR 1931

Sixsmith reading sadly senses his love traveling further
and further away

FROBISHER (VO)
You see where this is heading

EXT FERRY DOCK - DAY - YEAR 1931
A crowd boards the ferry Frobisher is among them

FROBISHER (VO)
My scheme had me traveling to
Belgium persuading Vyvyan Ayrs he
needed to employ me as an
amanuensis accepting his offer to
tutor me shooting through the
musical firmament winning fame and
fortune commensurate to my gifts
obliging Pater to admit that yes
the son he disinherited is the
Robert Frobisher greatest British
composer of his time

EXT FERRY - DUSK - YEAR 1931

Frobisher sits on the deck finishing his letter the chilly
channel wind fondling his hair

FROBISHER (VO)
I know Sixsmith you groan and
shake your head but you smile too
which is why I love you

A pretty SAILOR smiles at Frobisher as he puts his letter
away He smiles back The sailor heads below deck as
Frobisher feeling his luck begin to change follows

FROBISHER (VO) (CONTD)
PS Thanks for the waistcoat I
needed something of yours to keep
me company

EXT HYDE PARK LONDON - DAY - YEAR 1931

Sixsmith sighs a hint of a smile like the taste of
bittersweet fading as he folds the letter and tucks it into
a new leather bag as we hear--

MUSICIAN (VO)
Come on baaaaby we are meant to
be together

INT HIGHRISE APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

Close on a bag that could be Sixsmith’s but worn and aged to
a point beyond resemblance

An old man stands waiting for an elevator Out of the corner
of his eye he looks towards the voices and the sounds of a
party spilling out of an apartment

MUSICIAN
Luisaaaaa I’m tellin you baby you
can’t leave me It’s a past life
thing or maybe a future life but I
feel it you and me

A man too old for his leather trousers bare torso and zebra
waistcoat one arm wrapped around Luisa’s waist the other
holding a joint

LUISA REY
Not tonight sorry Thanks again
for the interview but really I
need to get home

MUSICIAN
Uh-uh what you need is to lighten
up baby

He takes a long hit

MUSICIAN (CONT’D)
En-lighten up Come on one little
magic carpet ride

The elevator dings and she looks at the old man who turns
away as the doors slide open

LUISA REY
Look just so there’s no
uncertainty I’d jump to my death
before Id ride a magic carpet with
you

She pries herself free as the old man gets on the elevator

MUSICIAN
Pick-ky Who do you think you are
Joni-fuckin-Mitchell

She runs for the doors that begin to close

LUISA REY
Elevator

MUSICIAN
You write a bullshit gossip column
for a fuckin rag You’re a NOBODY

The elevator doors are closing just as Luisa reaches them but
a cane suddenly jams between them forcing them open

LUISA REY
Thank you

The OLD MAN nods

LUISA REY (CONT’D)
Nice to know the Age of Chivalry
isn’t dead

He manages a smile but it is obvious that he is not a healthy
man In his hand is the small suitcase

They watch the needle leisurely arc its way towards the ”“L”
until a gatta-gatta-gatta detonates--

The elevator abruptly lurches to a stop and dies with a
mechanical scream

Both Luisa and the old man crash to the ground by the sudden
impact

Luisa picks herself up as the light stutters on and off
before settling on a buzzing sepia The sprawled man
recovers himself a little

LUISA REY (CONT’D)
You okay

OLD MAN
No bones broken I think

LUISA REY
Let me help you
OLD MAN
Thanks but I’1l just stay seated
for the moment in case it restarts
suddenly
LUISA REY
Feels like another power outage
Perfect end to the perfect day
She hits the ancient intercom button
LUISA REY (CONT’D)
Hey anyone there We’re trapped
Can anyone hear me
Static hiss

LUISA REY (CONT’D)
Christ

She looks up for a ceiling hatch

LUISA REY (CONT’D)
There’s gotta be an access hatch

There isn’t She looks at the old man

LUISA REY (CONT’D)
Only in the movies I guess

She resigns sitting down across from him
OLD MAN
Still glad the Age of Chivalry
isn’t dead

She manages a smile

LUISA REY
I’d still rather be here than back
up there

OLD MAN

Not your cup of tea was he
She snorts

LUISA REY
More like an occupational hazard

OLD MAN
What occupation might that be if
it’s not inappropriate to ask

LUISA REY
Journalist to some bullshit gossip
columnist to others

She reaches her hand out

LUISA REY (CONT’D)
Luisa Rey

He shakes it

OLD MAN
Rey Any relation to Lester Rey

She pulls her hand back and shrinks a little

LUISA REY
Yeah he was my father

OLD MAN
Really Do you know I subscribed
to Illustrated Planet in ‘67 just
to read your father’s dispatches
from Vietnam One of the few
journalists who grasped the war
from the Asian perspective

LUISA REY
Yeah

OLD MAN
I think I read that he had been a
policeman is that right

LUISA REY
Yeah

OLD MAN
But I recall there was some kind of
trial some malfeasance

LUISA REY
My dad could never play the game
so they kicked him out

OLD MAN
And then he became a journalist

LUISA REY
More like a Crusader

OLD MAN
Remarkable

LUISA REY
Yeah

He realizes just how painful the nerve is that he hit

OLD MAN
He must have been very proud of
you following in his footsteps

LUISA REY
Oh Luisa Rey is no Lester Rey No
award winning copy from war zones
No exclusive interviews with the
leaders of the Black Panther party
She’s done nothing with her life
but crank out a bit of simpering
gossip for a celebrity rag no one
ever admits to reading

OLD MAN
Yes but is it well written
simpering gossip

LUISA REY
Oh it is excellently written
simpering gossip

OLD MAN
Then don’t bemoan any misspent life
quite yet Forgive me for
flaunting my experience but you
have no conception what a misspent
life constitutes

EXT STARLIGHT BAR - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

An awards night for book publishers held at a posh bar with a
rooftop garden overlooking the city In the background a
jazz sextet plays quietly

CAVENDISH (VO)
‘Twas the Night of the Lemon
Prizes no bigger waste of time in
the entire publishing industry

Cavendish stands alone looking out over the rooftops Behind
him the party crowd a cloud of critics compliers
commentators - and writers

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
I recall a moment of introspection
at the balcony’s edge
contemplating a change of vocation
why why would anyone in their
right mind choose to be a
publisher Which was when he found
me Bad news inexorably does

DERMOT
Oy Timothy

DERMOT HOGGINS sidles up beside Cavendish

DERMOT (CONTD)
It’s all fockin’ bullshit mate A
fockin’ waste

CAVENDISH
Probably true but we never really
know what actual effect we have in
the Great Scheme of Things
Remember poor Melville writes a
ripping yarn about a big white
whale which is summarily dismissed
laughed at by critics rejected by
readers yet today lugged around
in the backpacks of every serious
student of literature in the
Western world

DERMOT
I don’t give a fock wot ‘appens
when I’m dead I want people to
buy my book now

CAVENDISH
As your publisher obviously
nothing would make me happier but
for whatever reason “Knuckle
Sandwich” failed to connect to an
audience

DERMOT
You want a reason I’11 show you a
fockin’ reason Right there

He points as though aiming a gun at a smiling MAN thoroughly
enjoying himself Cavendish immediately recognizes him

CAVENDISH
Ahh you mean Mr Finch

DERMOT
Felix Fockin’ Finch The cunt that
shat on my book in his poncy
fockin’ magazine

CAVENDISH
It wasn’t your best review

DERMOT
It was my only fockin’ review

CAVENDISH
It wasn’t that bad

He pulls a wadded piece of paper from his pocket

DERMOT
No (reading) “Mr Hoggins should
apologize to the trees felled for
his bloated autobio-novel Four
hundred vainglorious pages expire
in an ending that is flat and inane
beyond belief”

Dermot flings his glass over the railing

CAVENDISH
Steady now Dermot What’s a
critic but one who reads quickly
arrogantly but never wisely

DERMOT
Fockit

He heads for Finch

CAVENDISH
Dermot

Swiping two cocktail trays from passing servers he starts
banging them together

DERMOT
Ladies and Gentleman of the jury
Your attention please

Finch and his gaggle of admirers turn as Dermot bears down on
them

DERMOT (CONT’D)
We have an additional award
tonight fellow book faeries

Ooooh’s and chuckles all around Dermot

DERMOT (CONT’D)
An award for “Most Eminent Critic”
Competition was fierce but - (he
produces a crumbled piece of paper)
the panel was unanimous in
choosing Mr- oh beg pardon SIR
Felix Finch 0 B and E

Stirrers crow “Bravo Felix bravo”

FINCH
What might my prize be I wonder A
signed copy of an unpulped “Knuckle
Sandwich” Can’t be many of those
left

The coterie hoots Dermot seethes

FINCH (CONT’D)
Well come on I’m breathless with
anticipation Just what does that
lead-less pencil you call an
imagination have in mind to end
this scene

The tension goes out of Dermot’s face and he winks

DERMOT
Oh I think you’re gonna love this
one

He grabs hold of Finch’s lapels spins him around and with
surprising nonchalance-

Judo throws the critic over the balcony railing

Finch’s shriek ends with a terrible wet THUD on the pavement
below The force of the splatter sets off a car alarm

Dermot dusts his lapels and calls over the edge

DERMOT (CONT’D)
Now THATS “an ending flat and
inane beyond belief”

The crowd stands dumbstruck quiet enough to hear champagne
bubbling as Dermot saunters back to the bar and orders a
beer

MOVING IN on Cavendish who watches him his horror slowly
fading as he begins to sense something gathering momentum
like music in his head

CAVENDISH (VO)

My thoughts If I am honest I
admit that the obvious emotions
like shock and horror flew as
Finch had here and gone while
deep down I experienced a nascent
sense of a silver lining to this
most tragic turn

MONTAGE STREET VENDORS NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES TV

Newspapers and magazines are covered with pictures of Dermot
and Finch (headlines like “WRITER1 CRITIC0” or “Finch’s
Final Fling”)

CAVENDISH (V0O)
Overnight Dermont “Dusty” Hoggins
became a cult hero to the Common
Man

Television News and Talk Shows all circle around the scandal
of the month In a quick montage we can see more and more
monitors “Knuckle Sandwich” being discussed on every
channel

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
I have been asked on numerous
occasions what is feels like to be
at the center of a media storm

EXT CAVENDISH OFFICE - DAY

Cavendish is besieged by a blockade of reporters as he tries
to get to his office door

CAVENDISH (V0O)

Save perhaps the blood and the
dying I imagine it feels not
unlike being at the center of a
shark attack

INT CAVENDISH OFFICE - DAY

He squeezes himself in and manages to hold back the wave of
microphone-wielding zombies

CAVENDISH (VO)
However since there is very little
that can be done to stop it

He locks the door and turns looking a bit discombobulated
Across the room MRS LATHAM stands wringing her hands

Cavendish reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a bottle
of Dom Perignon

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
One may as well try to enjoy it

He smiles which causes her to smile and giggle

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
The highest selling Cavendish title
prior to the Dermont sweepstakes
was a cookbook penned by Princess
Diana’s former horse-groomer It
sold 5214 copies

A moment later the champagne pops and bubbly froth gushes

Cavendish exits after a magnificent day looking as dapper as

EXT TOBACCO FIELDS - DAY - YEAR 1846

Ewing and Goose are given a tour of the plantation by
D’Arnoq

D’ARNOQ
Reverend Horrox real specific on
how he wants the plantation run
The Georgian Way best way he say

The sun bathes the scene with migraine-inducing white light

D’ARNOQ (CONT’D)
The crop is mix of Nicotania
Tabacum and Perique Some Criolla
we grow on the side of hill over
there which can be treated for pipe
or cigars

They walk through the fields where the workers are cutting
the leaves

Ewing is soaked with sweat his sallow skin hanging like a
dirty washcloth around his eyes

EWING
The heat it’s unbearable

He mops his forehead looking at the toiling laborers
D’Arnoq watches him unable to say what he would like to say

EWING (CONT’D)
How do they take it

D’ARNOQ
Reverend Horrox says they like the
camel bred for the desert He
says they don’t feel heat like
civilized folk

Goose smiles while examining Ewing

GOOSE
It appears the good Reverend
understands physiology as well as
he does theosophy (to Ewing) We
should get you out of the sun

Ewing slowly realizes that the “humming” in his ears is
steadily growing louder

EWING
Do you hear that noise

D’ARNOQ
It’s coming from the camp

EXT PLANTATION CAMP - DAY - YEAR 1846

The camp is surrounded by a stake fence A hairless older
NATIVE raises her head as D’Arnogq leads Ewing and Goose past

The entire camp is gathered around a whipping post Most are
sitting on the dirt rocking slightly as their voices vibrate
at the bottom of their throats

There are two distinct classes of race one lighter than the
other

A chieftain occupies a throne wearing a feathered cloak
Tattooed gentry womenfolk and children remain transfixed by
the violence

The WHIP MASTER is a Goliath covered in lizard tattoos

With each excoriating lash the VICTIM shudders his back a
vellum of bloody runes

Ewing almost swoons as the next blow falls and in that
moment the victim raises his head—-

And looks straight at Ewing and as if in recognition--

The man reaches one of his bloody hands out almost pointing
towards Ewing

Ewing is unable to turn away and as the lash falls lacerating
flesh blood and bits of flesh misting the air around the
head and shoulders--

Ewing feels a nausea sweep through his body as--

He faints

INT THE MUSKET - EWING’S ROOM - DAY - YEAR 1846
Ewing wakes as Goose applies a cold rag to his forehead
GOOSE
Ahhhh there you are Welcome
back

Consciousness bobs in the pools of his watery eyes

EWING
»- what happened

He looks at Ewing’s dilated pupils
GOOSE
It is as I suspected Gusano Coco
Cervello better known as the
Polynesian Worm I once saw a
man’s brain after the Worm had
finished with him-- like maggoty
cauliflower but fear not this
particular devil and I are well
acquainted

The doctor listens to his heart with an odd stethoscope
noticing as he does a comet-shaped birthmark just above
Ewings heart

EWING
It was the strangest experience of
my life Henry I tell you I
could feel the lash feel it as
real as your hand I felt it land
and

Goose begins to mix a compound from his apothecary

GOOSE

A sensorial hallucination probably
brought on by heatstroke and the
worm’s reaction to the vermicide
As the parasite dies its poison
sacs will often split and secrete
These kinds of experiences are not
uncommon

EWING
You’re the doctor you’re probably
right

GOOSE
I know I am Now then urussium
alkali and orinoco manganese to
pacify our friend and finally a
little laphrydictic myrrh to
disintegrate it

He fills an ivory spoon and hands it to Ewing

GOOSE (CONTD)
Here we go--

Ewing inhales the medicine up into his nostrils
EWING

I don’t know what I would have done
had our paths not crossed

GOOSE
Well for starters you would have
died

His laugh is like the first shovel of dirt on a metal coffin

GOOSE (CONT’D)
I suggest we leave the good
Reverend to marvel at the miracles
of Providence and the inexplicable
ways that two people can be brought
together at just the right moment
As a man of Science I prefer to
suckle at the largess of
Serendipity with a tip of the hat
and a “don’t mind if I do”

Ewing tears with gratitude

EWING
You are as precious to me my
friend as any diamond

GOOSE
You should feel better very
quickly Adam A good night’s
sleep and you should be ready for
the boat

Frobisher strobes past the rows of Italian poplars coat
flapping gravel flying as he coasts up to the stately
mansion on a bicycle

A muscle-bound VALET working on a Cowley Flat Nose wipes his
hands as he moves to stop Frobisher

Frobisher hops off his bike leans it against the wall and
strides forward without any intention of being stopped

FROBISHER
I have business with your master

On the porch sitting in a wheelchair beneath foamy wisteria
listening to the radio is VYVYAN AYRS mid-70s though his
illness has ravaged him there remains a vitality behind the
sharpness of his eyes

Frobisher stops on the cinder path and kneels like Percival
to King Arthur

Who in the hell are you

FROBISHER
It’s a great honor ---

AYRS
I said who in the hell are you

Frankly sir he loathed me

AYRS
He did did he Why might that be

FROBISHER
I called his Sixth Concerto for
Flute (pauses then) a slave to
prepubescent Saint-Saens at his
most florid in the college
magazine

Ayrs wheezes as if his ribs were being sawed

FROBISHER (CONT’D)
He took it personally

AYRS
Oh I’ll bet he took it personally

In the gleam that sparkles in the corner of Ayrs’ weathered
eyes there is a moment of recognition

FROBISHER
Give me a chance sir I promise
you won’t be disappointed

INT AYAR’S CHATEAU - MUSIC SALON - DAY - YEAR 1931

Frobisher sits down at the piano sitting on the top of the
piano is a ceramic statue of St George and the Dragon

He has to move it to open the keyboard

AYRS
St George and the Dragon Reminds
me that composing is a Crusade
Sometimes you slay the dragon
Sometimes the dragon slays you

AYRS slowly moves towards his divan easing himself into
repose

FROBISHER
Yes sir

AYRS
I’ve had this little melody for
viola rattling about my head for

waver

Frobisher readies his pen and blank music sheets

certain notes seem awkward like teeth-breaking un-popped
kernels in a mouthful of popcorn

You must have misheard me I said I
had a melody not a malady

Ayrs reaches for his wife and begins to climb up from his

AYRS
This is an exercise in futility

JOCASTA
I see Should I be introduced

AYRS
There’s really no point The boy
is as useful as the clap
Fortunately he’1l be much easier to
get rid of

Leaning on his wife’s arm he heads for the door
AYRS (CONTD)
I’m feeling rather tired I think
I shall retire early Would you be
a dear and have Hendricks see the
boy out

JOCASTA
Of course

Frobisher feels his opportunity slipping away He stares at
the scribbled notations his fingers barely touch the keys
hovering

He closes his eyes and leaps

The music whispers across the room as gentle and intimate as
a lover letter

Jocasta stops to listen Both are spell bound as he plays

JOCASTA (CONT’D)
What is that

It isn’t exactly what AYRS heard in his head--

JOCASTA (CONT’D)
It’s beautiful

But it’s close enough

AYRS

I guess you could say that I hada
tape recorder and asked him
questions but he didn’t really
answer them He spoke in bon mots
not to you but to the ear of
posterity He told me his best
works were roller coasters I
pursued that idea I told him I
thought what was essential to his
and most of Hollywood’s success was
the partition or containment of the
terror so long as the Bates Motel
is sealed off from our world we
want to peer in but a film that
shows us that our world IS the
Bates Motel well that’s the stuff
of Buchenwald too dark too
depressing We’1l dip our toes into
a predatory amoral godless
universe but only our toes

What bon mot did he offer to that

If it’s painful truth you require
go see a dentist

LUISA REY

Who was it

OLD MAN
Someone I cared about very much

He looks at her intensely for a moment as if trying to see
something microscopic or beneath the surface

OLD MAN (CONTD)

A hypothetical question Ms Rey
as a journalist what would you pay
to protect a source

LUISA REY
If I believed in the issue Any

OLD MAN
Prison

LUISA REY
If it came to it yes

OLD MAN
Would you be prepared to
compromise your safety

LUISA REY
My father braved booby-trapped
marshes and the wrath of generals
for the sake of his journalistic
integrity What kind of a mockery
of his life would it be if his
daughter bailed when things got a
little tough

The old man nods staring at her and prepares to unburden
himself of a terrible secret when--

The elevator lurches rumbles and resumes its descent

INT HIGH RISE LOBBY - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

If there’s ever something I can do

for you please give me a call

INT CAVENDISH’S BATHROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Timothy is on his porcelain throne reading an article on the
rising star of the publishing business Timothy Cavendish

There is suddenly a violent crash from outside

CAVENDISH
What ---

He barely has time to consider the sound when the door to
the bathroom explodes open Filling the frame are three
large men Dermot’s brothers EDDIE MOZZA and JARVIS
EDDIE
Tim-o-tee Cavendish I presume

MOZZA
Caught with your cacks down

Cavendish still on the toliet tries to remain calm

CAVENDISH
My business hours are eleven to
two My secretary would be happy
to schedule you an appointment

EDDIE
Friends like us don’t need
appointments

JARVIS
We like it all cozy like this

He flicks his cigarette ash on Cavendish’s thigh

MOZZA
Visited Dermot today He had a
question for you

EDDIE
Where’s our fockin’ money

Cavendish clears his throat

CAVENDISH
Boys boys look here Dermot
signed a copyright-transfer
contract legally the--

Jarvis grabs the toilet plunger and jams it against
Cavendish’s throat

JARVIS
Dermot never signed no fockin’
contract for the event of the
fockin’ season

Cavendish gurgles
CAVENDISH
Perhaps er ack we might moot a
provisional sum as a basis
for on-going negotiation

Eddie taps Jarvis who releases Cavendish

EDDIE
Okeydokey What sum we gonna moot

JARVIS
Fifty K will do for good faith

CAVENDISH
Fifty thousand pounds

EDDIE
Tomorrow afternoon

CAVENDISH
This is a publishing house Do you
think we just keep money lying
around in shoe boxes

EDDIE
We don’t give a flying fock where
you get it grandpops just make
sure you do

JARVIS
Cash

MOZZA
No bollocks No checks

EDDIE
Old fashioned money A shoe box
will do fine

CAVENDISH
Gentlemen the law says---

They burst into laughter Eddie leans in his smile like a
broken bottle

EDDIE

INT CAVENDISH PUBLISHING - DAY
Cavendish paces trying to control his panic

MRS LATHAM
I can go through it again Mr
Cavendish but I think the total’s
right 2343 pounds and 16 pence
That’s all that’s left

CAVENDISH
How is that possible Money was
pouring in

MRS LATHAM
Debts mostly Mr Cavendish
Solvency has its drawbacks

CAVENDISH
This can’t be happening

MRS LATHAM
Sir You won’t let them take our
chairs will you

Exasperated he heads for his office

INT CAVENDISH OFFICE - DAY - YEAR 2009

The inner sanctum Cavendish stares into his wall safe empty
except a small black leather book

CAVENDISH (VO)

The situation looked dire but I
knew that Timothy Cavendish’s
capital in this town could not be
defined by an accountant’s balance
sheet It was high time to take
stock

He lifts the little black book
Cavendish is on the phone working his contacts
CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
McCluskie How are those delightful

kiddies of yours

MCCLUSKIE (VO)
Fine thank you

CAVENDISH
McCluskie I need eighty thousand
pounds

MCCLUSKIE (VO)
Right Mr Cavendish I’m afraid
your performance- linked credit
stream still has a twelve-month
flow horizon before resizing could
be feasibly optioned

CAVENDISH
Ok How about sixty thousand

LATER Cavendish’s fingers delicately fondle the veneer of
his desk

KIRPAL SINGH (VO)
Charles Dickens’s desk you say

CAVENDISH
Yes you heard right Charles
Dickenss own original authentic
writing desk for auction at
Sothebys with a reserve price of
sixty thousand I think that’s
quite fair

KIRPAL SINGH (VO)
I’m sorry sir but our records
indicate that the desk is already
accounted for by the Dickens House
museum

CAVENDISH
Ok how about Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle’s desk

LATER Another call his phone book open to the last page in
front of him

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
Ah mon cher tis “Cavendish the
Ravenous” your favourite Timothy--
The line clicks dead

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
Mon cher

He tosses the book in the waste paper basket
His fingers claw through his thinning hair The office seems

unbearably hot and he struggles to crack open the heavily
painted sash

As he gulps at the air he notices an old framed picture two
young boys dimpled smiles from another age his older
brother’s arm around his neck

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
In the darkness I suddenly saw the
light Blood has always trumped
water If the Hogginses brutes
wanted to turn this into a family
affair they’d find the Cavendish
Clan more than ready for the task
at hand

EXT DENHOLME CAVENDISH’S PATIO - DAY

DENHOLME CAVENDISH glares across his swimming pool as his
brother steps down his patio

DENHOLME
Oh Satans gonads not again
Look just bugger off and leave us
in peace Ill only ask you nicely
once

Denholme is trawling for leaves with a big net on a pole

CAVENDISH
It’s good to see you Denny

Denholme scoops a fistful of soggy leaves from the net

DENHOLME
Im not lending you a ruddy
farthing until you pay back the
last lot Why must I forever be
giving you handouts No Dont
answer

CAVENDISH
Denny Ive had a minor run-in with
the wrong sort If I cant get my
hands on sixty thousand pounds Im
going to take an awful beating

DENHOLME
Get them to video it for us Now
fuck off

CAVENDISH

Im not joking Denholme

DENHOLME
Nor am I So youre shoddy at
being duplicitous What of it Why
is this my problem

CAVENDISH
Were brothers Dont you have a
conscience

DENHOLME
Couple of Xanax and a Pimm’s cup
should set me right

Cavendish crosses to his brother hands searching for some
kind of lifeline

CAVENDISH
Help Denny Please

Denholme readies another volley of expletives when his wife
Georgette calls from the sliding door

GEORGETTE
Den Who on earth are you talking
to Oh--

The three of them look at each other An awkward silence
falls like a squall

CAVENDISH
Hello Georgette

GEORGETTE
Uh hello Tim

Denholme stews when suddenly a light goes on in his head He
smiles and whispers to his brother

DENHOLME
Alright Tim Sixty thousand
that’s going to take me some time
But in the interim I know the
perfect place for you to hide

with a finger to her lips

She gestures for her to follow Confused Sonmi climbs out
of her pod and passes by all her sleeping sisters

INT PAPA SONG’S - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

The dinery is shut down still and cold The only small
light is coming from the office Yoona leads her towards it

Seer Rhee is slumped over his desk drool glueing his chin to
his sony

YOONA- 939
He drinks Soap Purebloods
shouldn’t do that

SONMI-451
What happens to him when he does

YOONA- 939
He giggles madly for an hour then
passes out

SONMI-451
What if he wakes This is wrong
Yoona We shouldn’t be here

Yoona lifts him by the hair

YOONA- 939
He never wakes up Not without
Stimulin Like us in our pods
He’s lived with Fabricants so long
he’s nearly one of us

She drops him with a thunk

YOONA-939 (CONTD)
Come

SONMI-451
What are you doing

YOONA-939
You wanted to know what a secret
was I am going to show you

She leads her to the back of the dinery to a small blank
wall

YOONA-939 (CONT’D)
What do you see

SONMI-451
Nothing

Yoona pulls out the key she was playing with previously and
inserts it into a small hole A door slides open silently

Yoona smiles and gestures into the darkness Nervously
Sonmi steps inside

INT PAPA SONG’S - STORE ROOM - YEAR 2144
Yoona follows her in and the door slides shut
YOONA-939
Now sister Sonmi you are inside a
secret
A white blade slices open the dark revealing the contents of
the store room shelves with silicon plants shrink wrapped

dispenser packets forgotten coats and umbrellas

She aims the light at a section of the closet labeled “Lost
and Found”

Inside a plastic box Yoona removes an older model sony a
handy device to play recordings of all kind

SONMI-451

A sony We’re not allowed--
YOONA-939

Hush sister No one will ever

know

She sits and beckons Sonmi as Eve tempted with fruit Sonmi
sits bedside her

Yoona hits a button and a semi-3d image appears It is a
scene from a film An older ACTOR who bears a small
resemblance to Timothy Cavendish rises proudly and announces--

CAVENDISH LOOK-A-LIKE
This is a violation of the ruddy
Incarceration Act I will not be
subjugated to criminal abuse

He storms out of the white hospital-like room throwing open
the doors and as he exits--

The image blooms as if suddenly over-exposed then freezes
for a moment before repeating

The two Fabricants stare at the secret image and as it plays
again Yoona mouths the words with the actor

ARCHIVIST (VO)
Why didn’t you report Yoona-939 to
Seer Rhee the next day
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - YEAR 2144

But your actions violated the Fifth
Catechism

ARCHIVIST

How did you justify this

transgression

SONMI-451
She was my friend

Her answer surprises him

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t realize Fabricants had
friends

SONMI-451

There is much that Purebloods do
not realize about Fabricants
Isn’t that the reason I am here

He squirms a bit and then continues

ARCHIVIST
Please describe the events of March
23rd from your perspective

SONMI-451
I was wiping tables along the vidy-
bay I had a clear view of the
elevator bank

considers her

INT PAPA SONG’S - DAY - YEAR 2144

Sonmi is cleaning her tables Across the dinery Yoona is
serving a screaming party of children

Sonmi watches as Yoona stops smiling Her mouth begins
mouthing the words from the video “I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse”

Suddenly she lifts one of the children and runs out of the
dinery

Pandemonium screaming crowds fleeing from her path
enforcers radioing for help all seen through the surreal
silence behind the window the sound blocked by the plexi

Yoona uses the child’s hand to call the elevator They get
in and the door closes

Emotion floods into her as Sonmi tries to hold onto her
fading smile

From a distance we can hear the muffled sound of gunfire

The parent of the child continues screaming until the
elevator returns

An Enforcer hands the child to the parent
Yoona’s bloody body lays on the floor

Sonmi continues wiping even though she cannot look away an
unbearable sadness like a secret behind her eyes

It was my first experience of
death

CHANG
Officially-- Soap overdose
Nothing more pathetic than a
Pureblood hooked on Soap

He picks up the box of Soap

CHANG (CONT’D)
It’s unfortunate that it had to
happen now with everything going so
well because it’s probable that the
Enforcers and the DNA sniffers will
find out about you about your

to Yoona-939 and possibly even the
un-sanctioned thoughts that have
been going on in your head If they
do you will be decommissioned

Musicologically he is Janus—headed
Watching him use counterpoint and
mix colors is exhilarating but not
nearly as much as when he stops to
ask my opinion

fueling his hypochondria in order
to poison him for his money

relaxes aboard a train

I knew I could count on Dennie A
safe place to lay low was exactly
what I needed Soon after the
initial exhilaration of a journey
begun I felt my guard begin to
drop

He is reading a manuscript for a novel entitled “Half-

It was while reading a new
submission a surprisingly clever
little young-hack-takes-—on-
corporate-corruption ditty when a
powerful deja vu ran through my
bones

He stares out the window The landscape evokes forgotten
feelings inside Cavendish

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
I had been here before a train
just like this one gliding past the
same smear of landscape Suddenly
I was no longer Cavendish the
elder Squanderer of Life but

Cavendish sees another reflection in the window the camera
moves revealing a 19-YEAR-OLD CAVENDISH insecure red
cheeked nervously waiting for the train to reach the
upcoming station

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
» a young virile bohemian on a
train to Little Chesterford a
single thought like a scratched
record turning over and over in
his mind “Ursula”

The sign for “Little Chesterford Station” crawls past his
window the sound of the braking train like a siren call

Young Cavendish gets up jumps out of the train

From inside the train Old Cavendish sees his former self
hurry through the station towards the exit

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
You would think a place the size of
England could easily hold all the
happenings in one humble lifetime
without much overlap I mean its
not ruddy Luxembourg we live in
but no we cross criss-cross and
recross our old tracks like figure
skaters

particular moment Just as the

SONMI-451
It was exhilarating
EXT SEOUL - NIGHT - YEAR 2144
The doors open and Sonmi follows Chang out into the conurb

It is a sprawling urban canopy ADV screens hover and cover
almost every inch of open space

Transit tubes network gnarled strato-scrapers Sunpoles beam
light umbrellas radiating logos through the mist Purebloods
hunched over their portables

It is an impossible amount of information and Sonmi looks
about to get sick Chang takes her by the arm and steadies
her into the Elite-tube

INT ELITE TUBE - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

A private transport tube Chang presses his “soul” thumb to

Sonmi sits as the car hums quickly picking up speed banking
through the rivers of electric light

They dive down and travel for a moment underwater before
shooting up and weaving through older buildings a part of
the lower root structure to the towering spires rising above
them

After a moment they seem to clear an edge of the city and in
the distance Sonmi sees an actual mountain the sun rinsing
just behind it

CHANG
Are you all right

She nods

SONMI-451
My first sunrise

It is the first time we see her smile in a way that does not
seem like a mask

She looks at the sony in her hands

CHANG
Can I ask where you got that

SONMI-451
Yoona shared it with me I
couldn’t leave it behind

CHANG
You’re not supposed to have a sony

SONMI-451
I’m not supposed to leave Papa-Song
and yet here I am

He smiles already liking her

Can I have a look

She hesitates and then hands it to him He starts it and
watches the loop of the Cavendish story

It’s an old disney But where’s
the rest of it

SONMI-451
The rest of it

He examines the device

CHANG
This thing used to play vidies
They’re stories But its chip is
corrupt If you wanted I could digi
it and get you a complete copy
That way at least we’d know if it
was a happy or a sad ending If you
wanted

Tentatively she nods her head

He passes a building and peeks through the large glass
windows Inside a 50’s cafeteria where Young Cavendish and
Ursula are having breakfast

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
There was the cafe where we drank
milky tea in dirty mugs eating
toast watery eggs and canned

INT DOCKERY HOUSE - FLASHBACK - EVENING - YEAR 1957

Teenaged Cavendish his chin dappled more with fuzz than
whiskers wearing only his socks and a duvet returns to the
bedroom having raided daddy’s liquor cabinet

On his calf just below the back of his knee we notice a
comet-shaped birthmark

His nubile love lays on the bed re-reading the sonnet he
wrote

He climbs back into bed their bodies drawn to each other’s
warmth as she suckles the whiskey from his lips

CAVENDISH (VO)
Or so we thought

Mater stands frozen in horror as Cavendish mounts her
daughter Pater arrives as the two young bodies begin to
undulate

URSULA’S PATER
URSULA

Calamity Cavendish leaps away from her as if she was poison
oak Bare-assed he slips in his socks stumbles over a
table falls--

Sees a cat grabs it to hide his family jewels as he implores
the parents

YOUNG CAVENDISH
Sir Madame I assure you this is
completely innocent--

The cat scratches at his tender dangly bits and Timothy
screams throws the cat in the air as he slips backward and--

Crashes out the large picture window
CAVENDISH (VO)
Two sprained ankles One cracked
rib Official cause of accident
listed on the hospital form

Young Timothy lies sprawled in the garden bushes

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONT’D)
Pussy

EXTINT DOCKERY HOUSE - EVENING - YEAR 2009

The older Cavendish creeps up to the house towards that
window and peers inside the room lit electric marigold

CAVENDISH (VO)

Why had I never returned her calls
or letters Shame Ignominious
retreat Spinelessness Hallmarks
of the Cavendish Clan

He watches as a mother repairs a broken broomstick for her
child dressed as a witch

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
I knew I had no business going back
there I knew the chances that she
still lived in that house were
practically zilch and yet--

Suddenly an older woman dressed as a devil enters the
domestic frieze and Cavendish’s eyes lite up

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
There she was Ursula My first
real regret like a first
cigarette that began a lifelong
addiction

Ursula says something to her daughter and grandchild and
they giggle Cavendish cannot help but giggle too even
though he didn’t hear a thing His eyes go teary

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
Why was I standing out here in the
cold cowering in the shadows Why
was I not in that room lit electric
marigold I realized I had the
choice I could slink off and
return to the station and continue
as planned or I could go boldly to
the door knock without fear of
potential consequence and discover
what hope if any lay within

INT ELITE TUBE - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

He shrugs

He smiles

SONMI-451
Are endings always “happy or sad”

CHANG
Usually Most people like ‘em
simple

SONMI-451

But not you

CHANG
I like all of it happy sad and
everything in between with a creamy
scoop of sex served a la mode

She clutches her sony and edges away from him

The tube banks shifting into a different line which is now
headed straight at a mountain

CHANG (CONTD)
There it is

EXT BLUFF - DAY - YEAR 2321

Meronym and Truman Napes stare out at Mauna Kea a jagged
tooth of a mountain sunk into the underbelly of low lying

clouds

Truman rubs his beard then gestures with his pipe

TRUMAN
Won’t get me up that diresome
spire My granpas pa named Truman
Third went scavvin’ for Old-Un gear

He looks at Meronym

TRUMAN (CONTD)

INT CORE BUILDING - NIGHT

In an ancient ruin Old Georgie glowers over a man who
screams in terror

OLD GEORGIE

Eat

Old Georgie brandishes a spoon and scoops out the man’s eye
and pops it in his mouth The devil cackles

EXT BLUFF - DAY

Zachry is hiding in some brush spying on Meronym and Truman
Napes while Old Georgie whispers in his ear

OLD GEORGIE

Zachry watches Meronym and Truman Napes gesturing with his
pipe talking about what happened atop Mauna Kea

Zachry’s eyes narrow as he crawls away

INT ABBESS DWELLING - DAY
Abbess is tending the icons Zachry tries to remain ina
proper reverential position but he is too wound up

She opens the door to a young girl

Zachry hears his niece’s name and rushes to the door

ZACHRY

INT ADAM EWING’S CABIN - PROPHETESS - NIGHT

Lying on his tiny bed his body shakes from the pain and
Ewing awakes from a bad dream

EWING (V0O)
My Parasite writhes at night like
a new babes finger igniting spasms
of pain while visions and voices
obscene and monstrous haunt me

On his knees Adam Ewing prays into his clasped hands by
candlelight his shoulders hunched as if pressed down by some
unseen force The flame strobes against a ubiquitous draft
causing shadows to leap around the cramped cabin

He is pale a sheen of sweat covers his waxy face Finished
he crosses himself and blows out the candle

He’s asleep again In blackness we hear a voice

VOICE
Mr Ewing Mr Ewing

Startled Ewing awakes hitting his head on the bulkhead

He peers into the dark a shaft of moonlight washing through
the porthole Slowly a serpentine length of hawser uncoils
and he sees a black form rise like a djin

EWING
In the name of God---

MAN
Mr Ewing do not fear- Mr Ewing-
no harm no shout please sir

He leaps to Ewing’s bedside a powerful hand sealing his
mouth

EWING
Help Help mmph--

MAN
Mr Ewing no harm you safe I
friend of Mr DArnoq- you know he
Christian- please quiet

Ewing nods though he is obviously still afraid Slowly the
man releases Ewing’s mouth

AUTUA
My name is Autua You know I you
seen I aye- you pity I

EWING
What do you want with me

AUTUA
Maori whip I- you seen

The image of the Moriori being flogged by the Lizard King
suddenly flashes in Ewing’s head and he nods

AUTUA (CONT’D)
You good man- Mr DArnog tell you
good man- he hid I in your cabin
yesterday night- I escape- you
help Mr Ewing

Ewing bristles at the thought of D’Arnoq

AUTUA (CONT’D)
If you no help- I in trouble dead

EWING
Youre already very much in
trouble dead The Prophetess is a
mercantile vessel not an
“underground railroad for escaping
slaves

Autua straightens in pride

AUTUA
I able seaman I earn passage

EWING
Then I suggest you surrender to the
captains mercies forthwith

AUTUA
No They no listen I Swim away
home Nigger they say and throw I
in drink You lawman aye You go
you talk I stay I hide Please
Capn hear you Mr Ewing Please

Ewing shakes his head

EWING
No I can’t help you Whatever
D’Arnog told you about me I assure
you he is quite mistaken I’m
afraid your fate is your own I
desire no part in it

Autua’s voice softens to a whisper

AUTUA
Then kill I

His hand finds Ewing’s and he closes their fingers around the
hilt of a dagger

AUTUA (CONT’D)
Say to others I attack you so you
kill I

EWING
What

AUTUA
You no help I you kill I just
same Its true you know it I
aint be fish food Mr Ewing

With a terrible calmness and certitude Autua presses its tip
against his own throat

EWING
You’re mad
AUTUA
I not mad Die here is better Do

it Do it quick

Ewing swallows hard as a ringing begins to rise in his ears--

INT AIRPORT HOTEL - NIGHT - YEAR 1973
Sixsmith wakes to the ringing telephone
SIXSMITH

Luisa God I must have dozed off

Terrible dream Thank you for

coming I’m in 1404
He hangs up when behind him outside on the balcony--
A shadow drops from the floor above
He reaches for the report as A MAN slides open the door
Sixsmith turns just as the man steps close and places a gun
to the scientist’s temple and--

Pulls the trigger

Blood splatters the wall the lamp shade and a half-finished
letter to Luisa lying on the desk

Sixsmith’ body drops backwards onto the bed burying
Frobisher’s letters under his back

The assassin looks around He is a man whose most
distinguishing attribute is that theres nothing
distinguishing about him His name is BILL SMOKE

Smoke notices the report and the letter to Luisa when there
is a knock at the door

Silently he creeps to the door as the knocking continues
He looks through the peep-hole and sees Luisa

LUISA REY
(through the door)Dr Sixsmith
It’s Luisa Dr Sixsmith

Smoke puts the barrel with its long silencer against the
door aiming straight at her until--

She leaves

INT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - YEAR 1973
Luisa leads the MANAGER to the elevators
LUISA REY

He wasn’t looking that well the

last time I saw him and I’m just

worried that something happened--
The elevator opens revealing Bill Smoke
As Smoke passes them he looks at Luisa and in the look there

is something that reminds us of the look Old Georgie gave to
Zachry

INT AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM 1404 - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

The manager opens the door and Luisa follows him in

MANAGER
Oh my god--

Luisa covers her mouth Sixsmith lays awkwardly on the bed
blood Pollock-ing the wall the gun Smoke used now in
Sixsmith’s hand

LUISA REY
Go Call the police Hurry

The manager rushes out while Luisa quickly scans the room
The report and the letter are gone

The room seems completely clean until coming up from
looking under the bed she notices a tiny bit of aged paper

underneath Sixsmith’s back

She softly pushes him to the side and reveals the thick pack
of letters

FROBISHER (VO)
My Dear Sixsmith How I wish you
were here with me now

INT AYRS’ CHATEAU SCARLET ROOM - DAY - YEAR 1931
TADEUSZ AUGUSTOWSKI the Polish conductor and colleague of

Ayrs is reading “Der Todtenvogel” Ayrs and Frobisher’s
latest collaboration

FROBISHER (VO)
Today Ayrs and I presented our
first collaboration a short tone
poem called Der Todtenvogel to
Tadeusz Augustowski Ayrs’
favourite conductor It’s an
intriguing animal It borrows
resonances from Wagners Ring then
disintegrates the theme into a
Stravinskyesque nightmare policed
by Sibelian wraiths Horrible
delectable wish you could hear it

Augustowski sways gently to the music in his head hand
lightly bobbing in the air as if floating on an invisible
current

FROBISHER (VO) (CONTD)
Its the most accomplished tone
poem I know of written since the
war and I tell you Sixsmith that
more than a few of its best ideas
are mine Suppose an amanuensis
must reconcile himself to
renouncing his share in authorship
though Vyvyan recently referred to
our work as a “partnership”

Frobisher and Ayrs subtly watch in expectation Augustowski’s
monocle falls from his eye socket He turns to Ayrs

AUGUSTOWSKI
A man at our time of life Ayrs-—-
has no right to such daring ideas
Where are you getting ‘em from

Ayrs puffs himself up
AYRS
I suppose Ive won a rearguard
action or two in my war against
decrepitude My boy Robert here is
proving a valuable aide-de-camp
Frobisher smiles lifting a tea pot

FROBISHER
More tea
INT LUISA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

Luisa is smoking a joint reading Frobisher’s letters Her
apartment is cramped cluttered but comfortable

On one of the brick and board bookshelves we see a picture of
her father Lester Rey

Behind her a shadow drops from the balcony above

As she reads the shadow creeps up behind her until moving
around the couch--

Luisa’s scream catches in her throat--
As she sees JAVIER GOMEZ her teenage friend

LUISA REY
Jesus Javier Gomez what did I
tell you about jumping across
balconies What if someone reports
you as a burglar What if you
fell

JAVIER
Why do you leave your door open if
you don’t want me to come in

LUISA REY
Because Smarty-pants the only
thing worse than having you jump
onto my balcony is the idea of you
jumping onto my balcony and then
being stuck out there

She notices the welt across his face

LUISA REY (CONT’D)
Wolfman

JAVIER
It’s fine Doesn’t hurt

Luisa reaches for the phone
LUISA REY
I’m calling your mother She has to
know what kind of ass-hole she’s
dating
Javier watches her dialing

JAVIER
She knows

They look at each other Reluctantly she replaces the
receiver

LUISA REY
You know we can’t let this go on

JAVIER
(pointing at the letters)
What are you reading

LUISA REY
Don’t try to ignore me

JAVIER
I know you wanna help but if you
call her she’1ll leave work and
therell be a big fight and he’1l
smash more stuff and hit me harder
next time

The truth spoken without emotion or eye-contact sits like a
stone wall separating them

JARVIER
What are you reading

LUISA REY
Just old letters

EXT AURORA HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

enchantment of a Siren luring us
into dangerous waters Better I

Autua smiles gobbling the stale bread and cheese

EWING
Before I decide what I am going to

lips

She leaves her own smile flashing at Frobisher like a
peeking garter-belt

The two artists are left alone their expression a reflection
of each other

looked at me I saw something in
his ice-blue eyes something
beneath all the years and the
illness Something familiar

and intimately familiar

LUISA REY

STORE CLERK
I’m sorry it’s a customer order
Not for sale I shouldn’t really
be playing it

She puts her purse on the counter and digs out her wallet

Ooops Busted I thought I should
check it to make sure it wasn’t
scratched but to be totally honest
I can’t stop listening to it

LUISA REY
This is “The Cloud Atlas Sextet”

Then at once he is up and hurrying into his clothes

INT BOOM-SOOK’S DORMROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

Sonmi is alone soaking in the dull glow of her monitor her
eyes gulping down information

At the sound of the key in the door she quickly shuts off
the machine and crosses the room grabbing a beer from the
fridge just as the door opens revealing--

Chang

CHANG
Hello Sonmi

He smiles slightly taking the beer from her She closes the
door hiding the flush of heat she feels in her cheeks
whenever he says her name
She nods

Not exactly what I had in mind
Its Sextet Eve Don’t you deserve
a holiday too

The words don’t compute

CHANG (CONT’D)
Come on I’ve got a surprise for
you

INT HALLWAY AURORA HOUSE - DAY - YEAR 2009

Cavendish storms from his room into the hallway pausing to

get his bearings

He shoots down the hall toward reception slippers clapping
determinedly against the polished industrial linoleum

An uneasiness begins to fill Cavendish as baroque music lilts

in the identical chair-lined corridors

Suddenly a leprous GNOME still in his pajamas grips him by
the wrist and lifts a jar of hazelnut butter

GNOME
If you want to get a signal you’ll
need one of these

Cavendish grimaces

CAVENDISH
Youve mistaken me for someone
else

He pries the man’s hand from his wrist and continues down the
hall He has become unnerved however Something about Aurora
House isn’t right

He slows as he passes a window and sees the dining room
Dawning seeps into Cavendish as he sees the diners at Aurora
House are all in their seventies and up

He doubles his pace features reddening as he passes a
hulking ORDERLY

MRS JUDD greets him with an Oil of Olay smile at Reception

MRS JUDD
Hello Mr Cavendish Feeling super
this morning

CAVENDISH
Yes No An absurd misunderstanding
has occurred

MRS JUDD
oh

CAVENDISH
I ah-- I checked in last night
believing Aurora House was a hotel
My brother made the booking you
see His idea of a practical joke
But listen You have a bigger
problem closer to home - some
demented bitch called Noakes is
running about the place
impersonating a chambermaid
Probably riddled with Alzheimers
She stole my keys Now in a go-go
bar in Phuket thatd be par for
the course but in an old wrecks
home in Hull Youd get closed down
if I was an inspector you know

Mrs Judds smile is battery acid

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
Right I’1l1 need my keys back
straight away

He raps his knuckles on the desktop

MRS JUDD
Aurora House is your home now Mr
Cavendish Your signature
authorizes us to apply compliancy
And Id get out of the habit of
referring to my sister in those
tones

CAVENDISH
Compliancy Signature Sister

MRS JUDD
The custody document you signed
last night Your residency papers

CAVENDISH

(chuckles)
No no no-- That was the hotel
registry Never mind its all
academic My this will make a heck
of a dinner-party story Once Ive
strangled my brother Bill him by
the way Only I must insist on
having my keys returned And youd
better call me a cab

MRS JUDD
Most of our guests get cold feet on
their first mornings

CAVENDISH
My feet are quite warm but I
havent made myself clear If you
dont-

MRS JUDD
Mr Cavendish why dont you eat
your breakfast first and-

CAVENDISH
Keys

A group of residents have stopped to watch the escalating
exchange

MRS JUDD
We have your written permission to
hold your valuables in the office
safe

CAVENDISH
Then I must speak with the
management

MRS JUDD
That would be my sister Nurse
Noakes

CAVENDISH
Noakes Management

MRS JUDD
Nurse Noakes

CAVENDISH
Then I must speak with the board of
governors or the owner

MRS JUDD
They would be me

CAVENDISH
Your telephone please I wish to
inform the police--

MRS JUDD
Residents aren’t permitted to--

He slams his hand on the counter

CAVENDISH
I am not a ruddy resident

MRS JUDD
Youll find that temper tantrums
won’t help you at Aurora House

CAVENDISH
Look youre breaking the ruddy--
Anti-Incarceration Act or something
and I bloody hell won’t stand for
this

Before she can stop him Cavendish wheels with a grandiose
gesture and slams out the double-door exit

The cold snaps at his skin as he marches down the curving
driveway breath puffing from his nostrils like a locomotive

He rounds a bend and sees a shaggy GIANT in overalls rising
from an overturned lawn-mower He claps the dust from his
gloves

GROUNDSMAN
off somewhere

CAVENDISH
You bet I am To the land of the
living
He strides decisively past hiding his growing confusion in
the layout of the grounds

He follows the drive and realizes he has found himself back
at the dining room annex

Cavnedish huffs as the Undead of Aurora House watch him
through the wall of glass

He raises his hands in mocking horror

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
Soylent Green is people Soylent
Green is made of people

They stare at him puzzled when one of them taps on the
window and pointing behind him

Cavendish turns and sees the groundsman coming at him fast

GROUNDSMAN
Oy Get back here you

CAVENDISH
You keep away from me or I’1l be
forced to name you an accomplice in
the police report

The groundsman grabs for his shoulder but Cavendish swats him
away and angles himself behind a cart of clay pots

GROUNDSMAN
Ive better things to do than
this

CAVENDISH

Then go and do them you bloody
sodding soap-dodger

Cavendish heaves at the cart toppling it the ceramic pots
crashing down shattering at the giant’s feet

GROUNDSMAN
Right

Cavendish’s eyes go wide as the Groundsman springs at him
this time knocking away his flailing defenses arms wrapping
him up in a crushing bear-hug

The stink of fertilizer fills Cavendish’s nostrils
CAVENDISH
Get your hands off of me you
cruddy ruddy rugger bugger yob

The bear-hug tightens and Cavendish with a breathless
silent scream is abandoned by all force to fight back

Like a moldy sack of flour the groundsman carries Cavendish
by the picture window of Aurora House gapers

The rest of it

INT DISNEYARIUM - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

Chang and Sonmi huddle in the cramped “theatre” The room is
the equivalent of a present day porn booth where movies are
ordered via a comlink

On the crystal screen a calm Cavendish look-a-like sips wine
while typing his memoirs

CAVENDISH (VO)
Outside fat snowflakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls
Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in
Vermont I shall beaver away in
exile far from the city that knit-
ted my bones

The music swells as Chang looks over at Sonmi whose eyes
quiver with tears We aren’t sure if she is happy or sad

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
Unlike Solzhenitsyn I shant be
alone

We do not see whom he is referring to staying focused on
Sonmi and Chang

Jocasta casually opens her robe revealing her mature but
well cared for body

FROBISHER (VO) (CONTD)
Dont alarm yourself Sixsmith
Only in the carnal sense Dont
wish to brag but her first visit
at night didnt take me by
surprise

They begin making love Frobisher attending with a
connoisseurs care

FROBISHER (VO) (CONTD)
Really you should try women They
enchant in different ways a
section of strings rather than
horns delicate subtle their
desire like a secret and yet
invariably when one unlocks a
womans body her box of
confidences also spills What
secrets I wonder will tumble from
Madame Crommelynck’s lips

He kisses parts of her body that no one has kissed for a long
time and she moans with pleasure

INT HALL AURORA HOUSE - NIGHT

Industrial skylights cast perfect slabs of blue moonlight
along the floor of the otherwise dark corridor They shimmer
like sacrificial altars in the quiet of Aurora House

CAVENDISH (VO)
The stage is set

Cavendish creeps down the hall in a series of stealthy
serpentine stop-starts

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONT’D)
Aurora House the chess board

He edges into a shadow opposite of a security camera
CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
They will learn this certainty of
certainties a battle of wits with
a Cavendish is surely a losing
proposition

One final quick dash and he enters Nurse Judd’s office

INT NURSE JUDD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

The receiver chirps in his ear as it rings

After an almost interminable wait the line is answered

INT FROBISHER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1931

Frobisher is smoking a cigarette Jocasta beside him

staring at him

JOCASTA
You are so much like Vyvyan

The comparison flatters him
JOCASTA (CONT’D)
The way the light catches your eye
the silhouette of your shoulder and
neck all these little things that
remind me of him when we first met
He turns towards her
FROBISHER
Tell me about it Where were you
when you met
She is shy about it even though it is a fond memory

JOCASTA
I was a student like you--

Suddenly someone pounds hurriedly on the door

AYRS (0S)
Frobisher Open up

The doorknob is rattled

AYRS (0S) (CONT’D)
Hurry man Open the door

Panicking Jocasta buries herself beneath the covers as
Frobisher wraps a robe around himself and opens the door

FROBISHER
Ayrs what time is it

AYRS
Who cares I don’t know I’ve
heard a melody boy For violin
Quick Paper Find a pen

Frobisher looks helplessly around as Ayrs rushes past him

AYRS (CONTD)
Why the deuce do you lock your door
if you sleep with the windows open

He falls into the chair near the fireplace

AYRS (CONTD)
I heard it in a dream I was ina
nightmarish cafe blaring bright
light but underground with no way
out and the waitresses they all
»-- had the same face

Frobisher finds pen and paper then adjusts the second chair
so Ayrs won’t look towards the bed

AYRS (CONTD)
There was music playing
compressed hollow sounding but
unlike any music I have ever heard
in my life

He closes his eyes and tries to conjure it

AYRS (CONTD)
It began as Wagner’s Tristan Chord
hovering on the edge of
dissonance augmented fourth
augmented sixth

Frobisher scribbles the notes

Augmented second above what root

AYRS grabs hold of Frobisher’s arm but the younger man
doesn’t know how to help him

AYRS (CONTD)
It was so clear a minute ago

He closes his eyes and listens for it again He sags

defeated

AYRS (CONTD)
I’ve lost it it’s gone

FROBISHER
It‘ll come to you sir The minute
you stop trying to find it it’1l

find you
AYRS
You are naive Robert
FROBISHER
I am anything but
AYRS
There is a gulf between these
chairs
FROBISHER

You are older true--

AYRS
Fifty years is more than time--

FROBISHER
But what you want is no different
from what I want

A beat

FROBISHER (CONT’D)
The gulf is an illusion

Ayrs throws a quizzical smile at Frobisher

AYRS
What are you doing here Robert
You’re young talented intelligent
and by all accounts not wholly
repugnant Why do you stay

Frobisher sits in his chair knowing that he cannot answer the
question honestly

FROBISHER
I have learned more from you in six
months then two years with the
parrots of Caius

Ayrs smiles but knows it is not the whole truth He hauls
himself to his feet and they say good night to each other

FROBISHER (VO) (CONTD)
How I longed to speak the truth to
look him straight in the eye and
say “because of you sir Because
of the way you look at me when my
fingers coax your “tar-tatty-tatty-
tar” into a gentle melody Because
of the way you conduct with your
cigarette Because of the way your
soul swims in your eyes Because
you are my Verlaine and I your
reckless desperate Rimbaud
Because this is the relationship I
have been waiting for all my life”

The door closes with a heaviness and Frobisher sags against
it until--

Jocasta climbs out from the bed her expression a bemused
smile gleaned by insight

JOCASTA
I think my husband has fallen in
love with you

Her words send an electric thrill through his body but he
hides it behind his own shy smile

FROBISHER
Come now don’t make me feel the
cad

Her stare bores to his soul

JOCASTA
We both know what you are

thereby begging for my putative
conspiracy to be uncovered I am
neither that foolish or that
brazen

I’1l flay the truth from him

choice His liver was to be carved
from his side and served to his

yes

facility at our University
generates roughly two million
library download requests per
semester The vast majority are

Seems almost a shame but the
Will of the People must be
protected

The Enforcers file out behind him the door sealing itself
tight leaving Sonmi completely alone

INT AURORA HOUSE - DAY - YEAR 2009
Cavendish lays in his bed

CAVENDISH (V0O)
Trapped in a world where a clock
has no hands Primo Levi’s “The
Drowned and the Saved” scrolled in
epitaphs across my thoughts

INT CAFETERIA AURORA HOUSE - DAY

A pale nurse serves Cavendish his lunch a tepid lamb chop
starch grenade potatoes and canned carrots

CAVENDISH (VO)
“Freedom” the fatuous jingle of our
civilization but only those
deprived of it have the barest
inkling of what it really is

Cavendish sits in front of his tray staring at the horror it
holds

A nearby couple watches him intently as he surreptitiously
pockets his meds This is ERNIE and VERONICA

INT CAVENDISH’S ROOM AURORA HOUSE - DAY

Cavendish stands at the window the afternoon sun throwing a
crosshatch of shadow on his face from the security cage

CAVENDISH (VO)
Behold your future Cavendish the
Younger You will not apply for
membership but the tribe of the
elderly will claim you

Behind him a once stately woman and her colleague a rickety
greyhound of a man in a blazer stare in consternation

GORDON
Look here boyo we know you’ve had
a rough time of it but were here
to help

GWENDOLIN
A position to record Residents
Committee meeting minutes has
opened A fine opportunity for you
to jolly well get involved I
understand you were in publishing

Cavendish turns his chin jutting coldly

CAVENDISH
I still am in publishing Do I look
like I should be here

Dust motes hang in the silence

GORDON
Psst Your fly’s undone boyo

He turns back to the window

CAVENDISH
Get out

The two exit leaving him once again alone

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
This inescapable reality will
become evident only when the last
vestiges of your dignity are
stripped away

Cavendish zips his pants

INT EXAMINATION LAB - YEAR 2144

Sonmi is strapped into a testing device Various screens
pulse with MRI-like images others reading chemistry
fluctuations and organ functions

ARCHIVIST (VO)
You accepted that your life had
come to an end

A measure of electricity is sent through a synapse in her
brain Her body convulses against her restraints

SONMI-451 (VO)
I wished to be as strong as the
German thinker Nietzsche I wished
to not merely bear what was
necessary but to love it

The course ends and her body sags

The scientists nod and make notes

SONMI-451 (VO) (CONT’‘D)
In truth every day all I really
wished for was an end to my
suffering for someone to release
me

A pale and sickly Ewing collapses upon his bed

EWING

Everything hurts

The days events the excitements
it was all too much Tomorrow you

Goose smiles his over large teeth yellow in the swaying
lantern light as he prepares another spoonful of medicine

GOOSE (CONT’D)
Soon Adam It’1ll all be over soon

Adam inhales the medicine through his nose Goose still
holding the spoon

INT BAILEY DWELLING - DAY - YEAR 2321
Catkin slurps from the spoon as Zachry feeds her

EXT BALCONY - SWANEEKKE - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

Isaac is supposed to be giving Luisa a tour of the
containment chamber

Instead they stand at a railing overlooking the massive
structure

ISAAC
The funny thing is I’m not even
supposed to be here I was meant to
be in Washington but this stupid
air-traffic controller strike
screwed everything up so I have to
take the red-eye tonight Do you
ever feel like the universe is
against you

She takes a joint out of her cigarette pack

LUISA REY
All the time You mind

Trying to be cool

ISSAC
No no Go ahead

She lights it taking a strong hit while he looks around
making sure the coast is clear

LUISA REY
You seem nervous Issac Do I make
you nervous
She offers him the joint He hedges than takes it

ISSAC
No uh-uh actually the opposite

She cocks an eyebrow while he takes a hit and coughs a
little He passes the joint back to her

ISSAC (CONT’D)
I had a girlfriend once I mean
I’ve had lots of girlfriends well
not lots I’ve had my fair share
but there was one who you kind of
remind me of She hated math and
kept trying to get me to read
Carlos Castenada You ever read
any of that stuff

She smiles nodding blowing smoke out into the great
concrete void

LUISA REY
Oh yeah

ISSAC
I don’t really believe any of that
past life nonsense but every once
in a while I don’t know I can’t
explain it but I knew when I opened
that door somehow I knew you were
going to be there

Isaac takes another hit enjoying the taste of her lipstick

LUISA REY
But that doesn’t explain why you
covered for me

ISSAC
Rufus Sixsmith was a mentor to me
Taught me how to play chess how to
make a good pot of tea the best
way to enjoy cricket (asleep on the
couch) and when the aforementioned
girlfriend dumped me for a guy who
she believed had been her concubine
in a past life he gave me a
shoulder to cry on He was a good
friend

LUISA REY
I’m sorry

Two operators partially dressed in radiation suits enter the
bridge and pass by He hides the joint and does his best
“tour guide”

ISAAC
--It is the safest and most
sophisticated containment system in
the world

The operators exit the other side

He watches the smoke rise in wisps and disappear into the
concrete void

ISAAC (CONT’D)
They destroyed most of the copies
of the report

LUISA REY
Most

He looks at her like someone about to jump off a bridge
ISAAC
There is no good choice here is
there If I help you I could lose
my job or worse But if I
don’t a lot of people it’1ll be
worse than worse
After a moment of silence she looks him in the eye
LUISA REY

You have to do whatever you can’t
not do

INT PRISON CUBE - YEAR 2144
Sonmi looks up as the enforcers open the cell The
experiments have taken their toll Her perfect features are

worn and haggard She seems near to death

SONMI-451
Please I can’t

One of the Enforcers steps forward Her own face is
reflected in the mirrored visor of his helmet

He pulls a flask from his pocket

ENFORCER
Drink this

There is something familiar in his voice

INT THE PROPHETESS - EWING’S ROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1846

Autua holds Ewing tipping a cup of water to his lips

AUTUA
You gotta drink Missa Ewing And
eat You need food

He reaches into his pocket pulling out the same kind of roll
Ewing brought him

AUTUA (CONT’D)
Look Like you brought me

He smiles Ewing tries to return the smile Tries to eat
but it’s not working

AUTUA (CONT’D)
Come on Missa Ewing I ain’t

INT AURORA HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Cavendish lies listlessly in his bed trying to finish
reading the Luis Rey manuscript

CAVENDISH (VO)

My only salvation came in the form
of the manuscript I had brought
with me I read it like a bible
The struggles of Luisa Rey became
my own

A letter suddenly slides under the door

INT SWANNEKKE ISLAND - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

Luisa opens the hood of Garcia She stares at something that
someone put in her car it glows pale white against the
darkness--

The Sixsmith Report

INT AIRPLANE - YEAR 1973
Isaac Sachs sits on the plane writing in his journal

ISAAC (VO)
Exposition The problem of the
“actual past” and the “virtual
past” can be illustrated by a
historical event like the sinking
of the Titanic

The camera booms down to find a black attache case beneath an
empty chair

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DESTROYED CITY - DUSK - YEAR 2321

Meronym and Zachry reach a plateau where there was once a
large city

The shells that were once buildings slump and lay like suits
of armor of a medieval battle long after the carrion had
hollowed them out

Trees grow out through windows vines drip from moss covered
satellite dishes vehicles partially buried seem more like
grown-over crypts than cars

ISAAC (VO)
The disaster as it actually
occurred fades into obscurity as
witnesses die off documents are
destroyed and the wreck itself
dissolves in its Atlantic grave

INT CHATEAU ZEDELGHEM - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1931

Frobisher plays the Atlas half dressed lost in a fugue
scribbling notes quickly as the music pours out of him

ISAAC (VO)
Yet a virtual sinking created out
of reworked memory hearsay
fiction in short- belief grows
ever more “true”

INT SWANNEKKE ISLAND - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT - YEAR 1973
Luisa slams her hood Jumps in the car and peels out

As the car passes we see the lens of a security camera
watching her

ISAAC (VO)
The virtual past is malleable
easily pressed into the service of
the present as Powers vie for
legitimacy and the right to control
the actual and the virtual future

INT AURORA HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 2009
Cavendish opens the letter Inside is a note that reads
“You want out Find the Boiler room After lunch”
INT PRISON CELL - DAY - YEAR 2144
Sonmi acquiesces nodding ready to continue The Enforcer
that gave her the drink lifts her and they escort her out of
her cell

The uncreated and the dead exist in

both the actual and virtual past
INT CHATEAU ZEDELGHEM - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1931
Suddenly the music stops

Frobisher’s fingers are as still as a nervous deer

Ayrs in his bed clothes looking as if just woken from a
dream sits in his wheelchair

AYRS
That’s it The music from my dream

EXT SWANEKKE ISLAND BRIDGE - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Luisa races towards the crest of the bridge Behind her a
blue sedan with its lights turned off glides in pursuit with
the same menace as a shark

We have seen this scene before
ISAAC (VO)
Symmetry demands that future
creations and future selves wait to
be influenced by our present self
INT AIRPLANE - DAY - YEAR 1973
The plane speeds for its take off Isaac continues to write
ISAAC (VO)
Proposition I have fallen in love
with Luisa Rey Is this possible
I just met her and yet I feel like--

Beneath him the attache explodes

Having just lifted off the plane is ripped open by a
fireball
EXT SWANEKKE ISLAND BRIDGE - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

The blue car accelerates and pulls up beside her Luisa
looks over and sees a face that frightens her--

Bill Smoke

He slams his car into Luisa’s She screams fighting to keep
control as-—-

His larger car smashes her into the guard-rail which holds
once but then shatters--

Sending the Volkswagen lurching off the bridge out into the
open air

Luisa screams as the black water shimmering like snakeskin
in the moonlight rushes up at her--
EXT OCEAN BAY - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

The volkswagon impacts an explosion of furious underwater
bubbles scattering out

Inside Luisa smashes her head against the steering wheel
blood gushing from the gash as--

She is knocked unconscious
From above the car sinks in lazy liquid speed the hood

coughs open and the Sixsmith report dreamily floats out and
into the abyss

INT CHATEAU ZEDELGHEM - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1931
Ayrs looks like he has seen a ghost

AYRS
How do you know that music Where
did it come from

FROBISHER
It is the piece I have been working
on I call it The Cloud Atlas
Sextet

Ayrs wheels himself closer

AYRS
No No Robert This is from my
dream That night I came to your
room this is the music I heard in
my head Somehow I gave it to you

Frobisher smiles and begins to play gently

FROBISHER
While the idea of a sub-conscious
connection to you excites my
imagination I’m afraid there is a
more rational explanation

The music casts a romantic spell over the conversation

FROBISHER (CONT’D)
I have been working on the Atlas
for weeks now and I suspect you
heard it and incorporated it into
your dream

The old man wheels towards the piano staring at it as a
prospector might stare at a pan full of gold

AYRS
This Robert is meant for
Eternal Recurrence Let me have it
and I will explore its hidden
secrets Bring them to the surface

FROBISHER
The Atlas I believe is the only
thing I have ever done in my life
that has value Yet I would give
it to you give it gladly if only
this situation was different

AYRS
What do you mean Different how

He is unable to look at Ayrs playing softly

FROBISHER
There are whole movements in the
Atlas that I wrote imagining us
meeting again and again in
different lives in different
ages

AYRS
Yes yes It is the essence of
Eternal Recurrence We are bathing

in the same creative water Robert
(MORE)

AYRS (CONTD)
Something as important as this
cannot be described as yours or
mine It is ours

He stops playing His heart stands on the threshold of its
closet He shifts on the bench turning towards the older man

FROBISHER
That is exactly how I feel Vyvyan
That and more

He puts his hand on Ayr’s leg

Ayrs stares down at the hand on his knee It is impossible to
read the old man’s reaction

FROBISHER (CONT’D)
You can have the Atlas Vyvyan
You can have every musical thought
I ever have All I need is one
thing in return

AYRS
What

FROBISHER
You

It is impossible to read the old man’s reaction

FROBISHER (CONT’D)
You don’t belong here We both
know it’s true Come away with me
Leave Zeldelghem Leave this
rotting prison that reeks of
mushrooms and mold Leave your
wife Let us flee and be free to
live however many days we have
left together Run away with me
Vyvyan Run away with me

Trembling Frobisher dares to lift his other hand and touch
Ayrs’ cheek with his fingertips
INT PRISON HALL - DAY - YEAR 2144

Sonmi is led through the halls by the Enforcers that surround
and dwarf her

They march for a moment when one of the Enforcers moves with
casual ease as if he were pulling a pack of cigarettes from
his pocket--

Takes out a gun and spins towards her aiming at what looks
like her head--
But turns out to be the Enforcer behind her
His head explodes inside his helmet

Before anyone can react he spins back and puts two more dum-
dum bullets in the remaining Enforcer

Sonmi is paralyzed
He pulls off his helmet revealing himself It is Chang

Without thinking about it she throws her arms around him
clinging as a child might cling to a returned parent

CHANG
I’m sorry

Tears squeeze from her closed eyes

SONMI-451
--they hurt me

CHANG
I know I know I’m going to get
you out of here Come

INT PRISON HALL - DAY - YEAR 2144

Sonmi follows Chang as they rush through a labyrinth of
halls He leads her towards a door

CHANG
In here

Alarms begin to sound
CHANG (CONT’D)
Hurry
INT PRISON LOADING DOCK - DAY - YEAR 2144

They enter a large loading dock where supplies for the prison
arrive

Three ENFORCERS react training their guns on him

CHANG
It’s all right it’s all right

He waves his fake ID at them They are confused while the
alarm continues to blare

CHANG (CONTD)
I’m working for Boardman Mephi--

He lifts his gun and kills them all before they have a chance
to blink

CHANG (CONT’D)
In here

He puts Sonmi inside a transport filled with bags of laundry
He strips off his Enforcer uniform Underneath he is wearing
a bright colored Laundry Engineer uniform

CHANG (CONTD)
Stay hidden

He climbs into the driver seat More Enforcers are arriving
at the dock as he eases the transport out the bay door

INT TRANSPORT - DAY - YEAR 2144
Sonmi is jostled as the car begins to pick up speed

SONMI-451
Chang

CHANG
I told you Hae-Joo

Chang watches the screens for pursuing vehicles

CHANG (CONTD)
Uh oh

In the distance several individual pod-cars shoot into the
their tube while above the prison a large hovercraft rises

up

Like a cross between a harrier jet and a blackhawk
helicopter it looks fast and mean

CHANG (CONTD)
Shit

SONMI-451
What is it

CHANG
Trouble

INT CHATEAU ZEDELGHEM - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1931

Ayrs stares at Frobisher whose trembling hand is about to
slowly caress his face

The silence stretches until--

Ayrs begins to laugh

It is a sound that has broken more hearts than any other
Frobisher’s hands jolt backwards as if hit by high voltage

AYRS
Vyvyan Ayrs abroad with his
shameless sodomite

He roars the cacophony of laughter exploding like violent

cymbals

FROBISHER
I’m sorry-- I thought--

AYRS
You thought You thought what
That I might fancy a little
buggering from a fine young dandy
like yourself

The laughter dies smothered by disgust

AYRS (CONTD)
I’m not sure whether the idea
strikes me as more ridiculous or
repugnant

Frobisher hardens

FROBISHER
I’1l pack my bags and be gone by
morning

He stands and heads for the door but the force of Ayrs voice
stops him

AYRS
You will do no such thing You
will leave only when I say you can
leave

Frobisher turns

AYRS (CONTD)
Until then you will continue
working on Eternal Recurrence
When it is finished then I will
decide what to do with you

Frobisher sets his jaw

FROBISHER
You can’t keep me here I’m
leaving Good luck with Eternal
Recurrence I’m sure a sterile old
fuck like yourself is still capable
of something completely
immemorable

Again he heads for the door and again Ayrs stops him

AYRS
I suggest you think about this
Robert Really think Leave and you
will only compound your mistake
Think about reputation Reputation
is everything in our society Mine
is beyond reproach Yours my
disinherited gambling bankrupt
reprobate is expired

Frobisher realizes Ayrs knows more than he thought he did

AYRS (CONTD)
Did you not think we would check up
on someone living under our roof
Mackerras’ himself wrote and I
quote “He is a prostitute whose
liaisons with perverts and
sodomites were commonplace in his
brief and forgettable career at
Caius Lock up the silverware”
Unquote

Frobisher feels the world crumbling in on him

AYRS (CONTD)
Be warned leave Zedelghem without
my consent and all musical society
will know of the scoundrel Robert
Frobisher and the unspeakable
crimes he forced upon a helpless
old man

A smile twists across Ayrs mouth that reminds us of Old
Georgie

AYRS (CONTD)
After that even if you compose one
of the greatest symphonies ever
written no one will ever hear it
because no one will want anything
to do with you
INT CAFETERIA - AURORA HOUSE - DAY - YEAR 2009

Cavendish sits alone at a table unable to bring himself to
eat the gray food

He pulls the note from his pocket its words taunting him
“You want out Find the boiler room After lunch”

He stands

INT AURORA HOUSE - DAY - YEAR 2009

He stalks around the kitchen searching until he sees a
stairway leading down Nurse Noakes passes by and he quickly
ducks out of sight

When the coast is clear he slips down the stairs

INT AURORA HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY - YEAR 2009

He descends into the dark basement Pipes and wires canopy
the ceiling like jungle vines

A lone light bulb guides him deeper into the netherworld

At the end of the hall he sees a heavy metal door Beyond it
there is a glow of warm light and the sound of voices

He hesitates uncertain if this is a good idea
MERONYM (VO)
You all right Zachry
EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DESTROYED CITY - DUSK - YEAR 2321

Meronym and Zachry near the edges of the large city rising
up the side of the mountain

Veronica smiles

VERONICA

Cavendish isn’t sure what to say

ZACHRY (V0O)
Can I ask a ques’un

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - YEAR 2321

The flames of the campfire lick at Zachry who sits with one
eye on the darkness beyond

MERONYM
Yay

EXT CAMBRIDGE COLLEGE - DAY - YEAR 1931

A young Sixsmith crosses the campus tearing open the latest
letter from Frobisher

FROBISHER (VO)
Divorces Very messy affairs I
told Ayrs I would sleep on his
proposal Of course I lied

INT CAMBRIDGE COLLEGE - SIXSMITH’S ROOM - DAY - YEAR 1931

Sixsmith starts to pack throwing only bare essentials into a
bag

FROBISHER (VO)
Two things became clear Hanging
myself from Zedelghem’s flagpole
was preferable to letting that
parasite plunder my talents a day
longer and I must complete my
Sextet I can’t do it here so
tonight I plan to make my escape

Sixsmith slams open the door racing from the room

INT TRAIN CAR - DAY - YEAR 1931

The letter is still in Sixsmith’s hand as he stares out the
window thinking about how he should have done this a long
time ago

FROBISHER (VO)
“Tt will end in tears” You warned
me I suppose I’m as hopeless as
Adam Ewing oblivious to all the
unspeakable forms lying in wait for
us round history’s corner

INT THE PROPHETESS - EWING’S ROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1846

Close on Ewing’s swollen hand his ring finger is a
disturbing shade of blue as Goose clamps his metal pliers
into place

EWING (V0O)
My condition worsens with the
change of weather My fingers are
so swollen that Henry is forced to
cut my wedding ring lest it prevent
circulation and the onset of
dropsy The idea of losing this
symbol distresses me beyond
measure

GOOSE
Don’t be a silly puffin Adam I’m
sure your wife would set your
health and the survival of your
finger above a metal loop

Clack The heavy pliers bite through the wedding band

Goose slides off the ring and inspects it

GOOSE (CONT’D)

Besides I know an excellent
Spanish goldsmith who works with
such alacrity that your Tilda may
not have to know it was ever
removed

He smiles in the swaying lamp-light while slipping the ring
into his vest pocket

INT AURORA HOUSE - BOILER ROOM - DAY - YEAR 2009

Ernie fills four glasses with Irish malt Ernie VERONICA and

How’d you get it

ERNIE
I’ve got a few tricks left up the
sleeve as Noakes-sey and her
knuckle-draggers will soon

discover

ERNIE (CONTD)
But be warned most jail-breaks are
stillborn snuffed before they even
get started-- Loose lips sink

CAVENDISH
What about the parrot then If
ever there was a likely songbird

VERONICA
Mr Meeks is a fine and honorable
gentleman He would never betray
us

She kisses his forehead

MR MEEKS
I know I know

ERNIE
Besides no one’s ever heard him say
anything else

CAVENDISH
Then why do you need me Why isn’t
he your third man

VERONICA
Were not sure he wants to go

ERNIE
More to the point any jailbreak’s
a risky proposition One little
cock up and we’re dangling at her
Majesty’s pleasure S’truth we’re
not sure ol’ Meeksey’s up to snuff
Question is old man are you

Cavendish knows the answer to that question

EXT TRANSPORT TUBE - DAY - YEAR 2144

The Enforcer helicopter roars after the delivery transport
It glides up to the side of the tube maneuvering with hawk-
like grace so that the Enforcers are looking at Chang

ENFORCER PILOT 1
Unanimity requires your compliance
Stop your vehicle and prepare to be
boarded

The voice is heard both outside and inside Chang’s transport
Chang begins gesturing wildly

warning Stop now or we will open
fire

ENFORCER PILOT 2
Like anyone would give a shit if we
smoked an illegal

CHANG
Ja-yah Ja-yah

Chang hits the decel and the transport slows while the bullet-
like Enforcer cars race towards them

Chang moves into the cargo section In a plastic crate he
finds several weapons and supplies He grabs a roll of
medical tape

SONMI-451
Hae-Joo

She has risen partially from her hiding spot and watches him
as he tears a piece of tape

SONMI-451 (CONT’D)
I can’t go back to that place

He nods gravely

CHANG
It won’t happen You have my word

He reloads the charge in his gun

INT AYR’S CHATEAU - NIGHT - YEAR 1931

The door of Ayrs’ bedroom creeps open a knife blade of light
cutting into the darkness

A shadow steals across the room

Ayrs sleeps peacefully while Frobisher stealthily slides open
the drawer of his nightstand

Inside the gun gleams nestled in a chamois cloth beside a
saucer of bullets

FROBISHER (VO)
The room stank of bitter medicine
Had to fight off an unaccountably
strong urge to open Ayrs’ throat
with my pen knife Not quite deja
vu more jamais vu

He takes the saucer of bullets which rattle as he slips them
into his pocket AYRS stirs but does not wake

Then he takes the gun

FROBISHER (VO) (CONTD)
Curiously heavy things guns Why
did I take it exactly Can’t say
An intuition A sense of
significance That from this point
on there was no going back

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DUSK
Zachry and Meronym have stopped along an old ruined road cut
into the mountainside Their path ends where a bridge has
crumbled away into a rocky chasm

Meronym takes out a strange gun from her bag and looks up as
a light snow has begun to fall zig-zagging in the gusting
wind

MERONYM
From the look of those clouds we
don’t have a lot of time

She aims the gun and fires a grappling hook up and across the
chasm It catches on a knot of rusting re-bar

ZACHARY
Whaaaah

She hands him the rope

MERONYM
You first

He looks up and knows what’s waiting for him

Zachry scales the rope a fierce wind biting into him with the
sting of shards of glass He slips and zippers open the skin
in his palms

When he reaches the crest his stomach drops at the site of
their destination an array of monolithic towers looming
ominously against a roiling black sky

The threatening blizzard swirls like a snow globe

Below he sees Meronym’s climb is going harder Zachry begins
hand over hand pulling her up to help

His hands burn with the effort

When she is almost to the top the strain forcing beads of
sweat on his brow Zachry looks up time slowing to a halt

Sparkling snowflakes freeze in the air if they were a snap
shot

OLD GEORGIE
Zachry the cowardy you trodd’n on
the Devil’s ground now Vall’ysman

Zachry turns and along the ridge he sees Old Georgie swishing
snowflakes out of his way as he closes in on him

His eyes gleam unnaturally as he cranes his spindly body
forward and hisses

OLD GEORGIE (CONT’D)
I’m sayin’ this jus’ once The
offlander ain’t gettin’ to the top
You let-go that rope

Zachry looks down at the frozen Meronym dangling twenty feet
above the rocky ground

OLD GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Her fall may not kill her when I
let time flow again but them rocks
blowll bust her spinenlegs an
shell not s’rive the night I’1l1
let her consider her’follyins

Why not jus’ kill her yerself

Old Georgie bellows

OLD GEORGIE

Why-why-why I want you to do it

leadin’ you straight into a place
there ain’t no return I promise
Ain’t nothing in there for a soul

A chill hits Zachry
OLD GEORGIE (CONT’D)
So you ever wanna see Catkin again

ZACHRY
No bolt-hole out o this

OLD GEORGIE

Zachry about to let go looks down at Meronym blood oozing
from between his clenched fists

OLD GEORGIE (CONT’D)

A sudden flash of Autua’s bloody hands bursts before him
Zachry whispers to himself

ZACHRY
“Hands’a’bleedin’ mus’nt let go”

OLD GEORGIE
Three

Old Georgie’s eyes bore into him

ZACHRY
No

He heaves on the rope

Old Georgie’s angry scream becomes the furious wind as time
resumes and Zachry hauls Meronym to safety

MERONYM
Thank you Zachry That’s a bleary
fearsome wind

They stand close enough to feel the warmth of each other’s
body

INT AYRS’ CHATEAU - FROBISHER’S ROOM - NIGHT - YEAR 1931
Frobisher is packing furiously The gun is on the bed

He is so intent on what he is doing he doesn’t notice the
door swing open revealing Ayrs still in his bed-shirt

AYRS
What are you doing boy

Frobisher is startled

AYRS (CONTD)
I thought I made myself clear

FROBISHER
Do what you want but I’m leaving

He packs the last of his things
AYRS sees the manuscript for the Sextet
AYRS
Fine Frobisher Go But I’11
take this

He snatches the sheaf of papers Frobisher feels as if he
just tore the heart from his chest

FROBISHER
Give me that

AYRS
Consider it redress for what you’ve
put me and my family through

FROBISHER
I’m warning you old man--

AYRS
Under the conditions of this
relationship I am certainly within
my legal rights If I were you
I’d pack my bag and go

FROBISHER
Goddamn you

He grabs the gun from the bed and thrusts it at AYRS
FROBISHER (CONT’D)
Give it to me or I swear to god I
will kill you as you stand
Ayrs steps towards the barrel of the gun

AYRS
Give me the gun Frobisher--

FROBISHER
I’11 kill you--

AYRS
Please You’re a degenerate and a
coward You won’t pull that
trigger Your kind never does
He continues to move closer until he grabs hold of the gun

FROBISHER
No

The men begin to fight for control of the weapon until--
It goes off the sharp metal clap startling both of them--

The shell of the bullet bouncing on the wood floor with the
sound of a delicate chime

It rolls under the bed where we can see the feet of the two
men Ayrs staggers back from Frobisher

Blood drips on to the floor

Ayrs crumples to his knees as Frobisher shuffles grabbing
his things and the manuscript and then runs

As we pan with him we see a tattered book wedged under the
short bed-post--

It is the lost half of the “Pacific Journal Of Adam Ewing”

INT THE PROPHETESS - EWING’S CABIN - DAY - YEAR 1846

Goose enters Adam’s quarter’s Adam looks like a breathing
corpse Goose searches for a moment

He tries to open a metal lock box but he needs a key
Adam stirs

GOOSE
How fares our worm today Adam

EWING
»-l’m afraid it has taken the best
of me

GOOSE
Nonsense

He examines him looking into his eyes

GOOSE (CONT’D)
Although I must admit this
treatment is going on much longer
than I anticipated Perhaps it is

strength and finish this once and
for all

Chang lifts his arms in confused hysteria

Another Enforcer aims a scanner and a red beam sweeps across
Chang

Before he can answer Chang attacks every move like the crisp
metallic precision of a chambering bullet--

The gun taped to the back of his neck ripped free--

Exploding dum-dum bullets transforming faces into meaty
carmine anemones

The back-up Enforcers counter but Chang is impossibly fast
leaping for cover closing with predatory focus as they
panic praying and spraying wildly

EXT TRANSPORT TUBE - DAY - YEAR 2144

The hovercraft opens fire their weapon like an anti-aircraft
cannon combined with a chain gun

The destructive force shatters the high density tube and
reduces the transport to alpine swiss

Chang covers Sonmi protecting her with his own flesh as they
can do nothing but hope for it to end

Finally it does

INT ENFORCER HOVERCRAFT - DAY - YEAR 2144
The co-pilot checks his scanners

ENFORCER PILOT 2
I got nothing sir No movement
Six dead Enforcers and-- wait I
got movement

INT TRANSPORT - DAY - YEAR 2144

Chang hoists a home-made rocket launcher from the crate to
his shoulder

Before the hovercraft reacts he stands and fires out the
hole blown in the side of the truck and the tube

The pilot tries to dodge the missile but the tail is hit
exploding sending the hovercraft into a wild spinning
descent

ENFORCER PILOT 1
Mayday Mayday We are hit Going
down The terrorist is still at
large

Chang tosses the rocket launcher and reaches for Sonmi who is
too stunned to even move

A door that has not been opened for a century cracks slowly
Dust immediately rises up in agitation

Meronym uses a glo-light as she leads Zachry into the

An ancient security guard sits like a mummy perfectly
preserved his eyeless eyes staring at them as they pass

Deirdre a sexless automaton is watching the home shopping

She reaches for her cell phone to buy a commemorative
Princess Di plate when a frantic Veronica rounds the corner

VERONICA

other

Deirdre lunges from her chair

INT DINING ROOM AURORA HOUSE - DAY - YEAR 2009

Cavendish and Ernie stand snarling at one another between
them each with unbudging grip on a single chocolate pudding
cup
A crowd has gathered
ERNIE

Deirdre and Veronica cut through the crowd

DEIRDRE
Alright you two--

As she moves to separate them all Hell breaks loose

Ernie grabs a condiment cup of mustard from his tray and
shoves it hard into Cavendish’s face

Cavendish screams

CAVENDISH
AAAAAAAGGGGHHH-- Hot Dijon My
eyes Help--Somebody help me

Cavendish sinks his teeth into Ernie’s hand still clutching
the cup of pudding

Ernie screams

They grapple as Deirdre tries to wedge herself between the
two Tables and chairs topple in the fracas when finally with
the help of a couple of orderlies they are separated huffing
and puffing

As they are dragged away they both surreptitiously look back
to Veronica who signals to them with a gentle swipe of a
finger across the bridge of her nose

They look at each other and smile Veronica turns to leave
her hand slipping Deirdre’s cell phone into her pocket
INT TRANSPORT TUBE - DAY - YEAR 2144

Chang his body laid out as though riding a high-powered
motorcycle weaves the Enforcer bullet car through the

thickening traffic

Sonmi lays on top of him her eyes bulging as they barely
miss several vehicles

Behind them several hovercrafts closing fast
Chang taps his com-link implant
CHANG
This is Prophet One Abort Repeat-
Abort

He clicks the link off

SONMI-451
What did that mean

CHANG
There was a plan But that plan is
fucked

SONMI-451

What are you going to do

CHANG
Everything I can

The car swerves through a tube flowing in the opposite
direction--
Banking away into a tangle of buildings as the hovercraft
lose sight of them for a moment
INT TRANSPORT TUBES - DAY - YEAR 2144

He dives the bullet car down through a “cargo tube” where
large slow vehicles transport goods

He slips and slides through them moving like a mouse trying
to stay out of sight but no matter where he goes--

He is still stuck in a hamster tube

A hovercraft sights him and again the Enforcers converge
Accelerating he hits an intersection and banks like a luge
sled--

Heading into a building’s docking bay--

Disappearing from sight

INT DOCKING BAY - DAY - YEAR 2144

Several gates are blocking the way but Chang opens fire the
car’s guns shredding most of the obstacles--

Aiming the car straight into the blasted roller doors

CHANG
Hang on

She squeezes tightly to him as they impact--

Crashing through the doors into the building

EXT OLD BUILDING - DAY - YEAR 2144

Several of the larger hovercrafts set down Enforcers
beetling out swarming around the building

Pushing open the bullet car sleeve Chang helps Sonmi crawl
out of the wreckage

Using their scanners the Enforcers search the building

SCAN ENFORCER

They burst into a room vision-goggles illuminating the dark
room where they find Sonmi She raises her hands as they
scream at her aiming their weapons--

Not paying attention to the shadow moving behind them

Chang attacks killing several with his hands the last two
with a gun

CHANG
In here

Enforcers react to the violence swarming towards them

INT OLD BUILDING - BATHROOM - DAY - YEAR 2144

Chang leads her into a bathroom He checks the walls with an
orison orb then pulls out his gun

He opens fire on the wall

The enforcers hear the gunfire and race towards it

INT OLD BUILDING - BATHROOM - DAY - YEAR 2144

A large PVC pipe has a hole blown in it Vapors that burn
Sonmi’s eyes pour out of it

What is that

Chang looks into it Far below black water ripples

He yanks off the hidden flak jacket

Hold your breath as long as you
can I’11 find you and get you out
They can hear the boots of the Enforcers

CHANG (CONTD)
Do you trust me

She nods

He jumps into the tube and disappears A moment later there
is a thick splash

The sides of the pipe drip with feces The smell is
overwhelming

The Enforcers find the room as she is still clambering into
the pipe

ENFORCER
Don’t move

She lets go--
Falling down into a shit-lined abyss until--

Luisa jolts awake

Her car still sinking the water seeping in through the
windows is filled to her waist

She tries not to panic She grabs the handle of the window
and starts unrolling it As she does the water begins
pouring in

Very quickly the water rises to her chest The window is
only open six inches when--

The handle snaps off
She screams The water keeps pouring in

She climbs over to the other door and starts trying to unroll
that window The water rises past her neck

The handle gets tangled in the seat belt which floats like
an eel

Again frustration and fear shake through her body The water
rises to her nose as she takes her last breath

Underwater she grabs the window and yanks and shoves with
all her strength until--

The window breaks

She kicks herself free of the sinking car her lungs aching
kicking up through the cold silent liquid obsidian until--

She bursts out the surface

Seeing no one he hurries back to the stairs

Luisa still soggy and shivering slips out of the shadows
and up the stairs

shadow crosses behind her--

A man wearing black leather gloves

Brown clumpy filth swirls into the shower drain as rivulets
of waste run down Sonmi’s body

Numb she leans in the corner letting the water pour over
her

Her expression suggests a vague understanding that there are
things that have happened to her that she will never be able
to wash away

She tries to scream but it’s too late
Napier holds Luisa tight

He slowly starts to relax when she attacks--

Stomping on his foot smashing the back of her head into his
face--

He staggers back his reflexes faster than most but not fast
enough as--

A switchblade snaps open and is jammed under his neck tight
to his jugular

you’d already be dead How’s that
feel Great conversation starter

to fail They want the explosion
the chaos and carnage and the more

begin to make love in the glow of the twinkling lights

EXT BRUGES TOWER - DAWN - YEAR 1931

The sun rise is so beautiful from the top of the tower
Frobisher feels his eyes softening to tears

FROBISHER (VO)
Sixsmith Don’t worry all is well
All is so perfectly damnably well
Wish I could make you see this
brightness I climb the steps of
the Bruges tower every morning and
all becomes clear

As the sun reaches her pink fingers into the sky the distant
sounds of the waking city become the music Frobisher hears in
his head his Sextet

INT THE PROPHETESS - EWING’S ROOM - DAY - YEAR 1846

Ewing shivers and writhes his sweating flesh twisted into
agonizing knots

Goose watches from the shadowed doorway as if enjoying a work
of art a Romantic era depiction of suffering

It is the middle of the night Cavendish is dressed and
packing his bag--

Placing inside with care “Half-Lives A Luisa Rey Mystery”

illusion

INT CHINA SHOP - DAY - YEAR 1931

Close on the ceramic St George and the Dragon It is the
same as the one in Ayrs’ music room

FROBISHER (VO)
My life extends far beyond the
limitations of me

Frobisher looks at the knight The silence aches in his
ears

When he looks up he sees Young Sixsmith step into the shop

He is so startled that he drops the knight

When it hits instead of the noise of shattering glass there
is beautiful music an august melody
Frobisher cocks an eyebrow A statue of a boy playing
attracts him He nudges it off the shelf Again there is
music
Sixsmith smiles and he pushes a vase
The music swells into a sweeping symphony as they destroy the
entire shop
EXT FERRY - DAY - YEAR 1931
Sixsmith wakes from his dream The crew is ringing the ready
bell as they prepare to dock in Bruges
EXT BRUGES - DAY - YEAR 1931

Close on a newspaper The article headline reads “Maestro
Recovering Assailant Still At Large”

Frobisher sneers

FROBISHER
Maestro my ass

As he takes a sip of coffee he looks out across the crowded
square and sees-—

Two police officers heading towards the cafe

Hiding behind his paper he waits for them to pass When they
do he quickly slips away

EXT HUAMDONGGIL CHECKPOINT - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

Sonmi follows Chang through the crowded checkpoint Like
Tijuana people are allowed easy access for leaving the
Conurb Sonmi sees the heavily armed Enforcers on the other
side of the fence

A noxious maze of low crooked ramshacks flophouses
pawnshops drug bars and comfort hives covering perhaps
five square miles southeast of Old Seoul Transit Station

Its streets are narrow choked with pedestrians and bicycles
its alleys reek of waste and sewage Purebloods slump in
doorways their skin ravaged by the acid rain A BEING that
looks like a child laps water from a dirty puddle

CHANG
Stay close to me Fabricants often
get snatched here

SONMI-451

CHANG
Slave labor Sex trade Anything
and everything

SONMI-451
This is where your General lives

Chang smiles
CHANG
This is where Union was born
INT MADAME OVID’S - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

Close as a scalpel slices along the tip of Sonmi’s index
finger She inhales sharply

The implanter digs into her finger and removes a strip of
nanotech

SONMI-451
What is that

IMPLANTER
Your identity

He takes another strip from his tray and sticks it into the
bloody slice

Sonmi reacts but it’s over quickly as he sprays her finger
with coag stopping the bleeding immediately

SONMI-451
Who am I now

CHANG
Who would you like to be

When The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy
Cavendish is turned into a film I
advise thee Director dearest whom
I picture as an intense
turtlenecked Swede named Lars when
casting the part of the hero of
this tale one Timothy Cavendish
please make sure the thespian in

I’m thinking Sir Laurence Olivier
with a dash of Michael Caine

INT BOILER ROOM AURORA HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Cavendish coolly enters the boiler room carefully looking
back one final time to make sure he wasn’t followed

Ernie checks his watch
ERNIE
Last chance to back out if you
dont think you can hack it
CAVENDISH
Ive never backed out of anything
in my life

Ernie smiles then turns and unscrews the ventilation unit
pulling Deirdres mobile telephone from its hiding place

ERNIE
Well let’s hear the master
bullshitter work his magic
The number in the display stares up at him and he hits send

A sleepy voice answers

INT MADAME OVID’S - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

A pair of laser pliers are used to cut through the collar
encircling Sonmi’s neck

It comes off and Sonmi feels a vertigo spin through her body
She touches her own neck for the first time in her life As
she does we notice a comet-shaped birthmark that was hidden
beneath the collar

Chang smiles

CHANG
Hows that feel
SONMI-451
Strange frightening but good
CHANG
That’s it You’re ready
SONMI-451
For what
CHANG

To meet the General

There is a knock at the door

INT LUISA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT - YEAR 1973

Luisa opens the door revealing Javier who smiles as bright as
the sun

JAVIER
So you survived the night Cool

LUISA REY
Don’t you ever go to school

JAVIER
Walt Whitman dropped out of
Elementary school Ditto Mark
Twain
There’s no winning against Javier

LUISA REY
What do you want for breakfast

JAVIER
Grape nuts Banana if you got it

He comes in closing the door behind him

EXT MAH-JONGG HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2144
Chang knocks on a door hidden at the end of a nameless alley
The electric eye in the door opens staring at them

CHANG
It’s Chang

After a moment of deliberation the door unbolts and opens

A large man who could be a Fabricant escorts them inside
Sonmi sees the gun bulging under his coat

INT MAH-JONGG HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

Chang and Sonmi enter and are escorted through a maze of
smoky rooms filled with ugly faces floating above their
clattering tiles

Their escorts are wearing blood stained body armor yet no one
blinks an eye

In a back room the door is bolted

An ancient brazier hums with modern circuity A sphere of
dark sheen and refracted silence aquifies all the surrounding
noise

In the center of the room a young boy appears like a ghost
His voice is that of an old man

AN-KOR APIS
Sonmi-451 I am sorely thankful to
see you still alive and truly
honored to meet you I am General
An-Kor Apis leader of Union

Unsure how to react Sonmi bows

AN-KOR APIS (CONT’D)
I apologize for the Sim-com but my
advisors assure me it is a
necessary precaution I am also
forced to be brief I know you
have many questions but let me
begin with the how

Sonmi stares through the light gauze of smoke

AN-KOR APIS (CONT’D)
Years ago a psychogenomicist named
Yusouf Suleiman proved that
Fabricants were capable of the same
consciousness as any Pureblood He
was rewarded for the discovery of
this scientific truth with
imprisonment execution and the
eradication of any evidence
suggesting the success of his
experiment

JAVIER
What do they want

LUISA REY
It’s complicated

INT MAH-JONGG HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

The General lights a cigarette the real and virtual smoke
layering on each other

AN-KOR APIS
A high ranking genomicist inside
the Ministry of Science and
Commerce is sympathetic to our
cause It was he that supplied us
with Suleiman’s formula The rest
of the details are superficial the
use of shells and intrigues to
secure a legitimate research
license as well as the necessary

unwitting help of a University

INT CORRIDOR AURORA HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Cavendish is standing sentinel in Mr Meekss room watching
his own room just across the hall through the crack in the
door

CAVENDISH (VO)
Ernie’s plan was a series of
toppling dominoes The first of
which had fallen predictably and
flawlessly But the third was a
crapshoot and could fall in
unwelcome directions At a quarter
past ten Ernie went to Reception to
announce my death to Nurse Noakes
The big unknown lay in Nurse
Noakess personal loathing for me
Would she rush to see her enemy
fallen to stick a hatpin in my
neck to check I was truly dead Or
celebrate in style first

Mr Meeks watches over Cavendish’s shoulder as hurried soft-
soled footsteps echo in the hall Nurse Noakes stops in front
of Cavendish’s room collects herself then knocks

MR MEEKS
I know I know

She tries the handle as Cavendish silently hushes him
NOAKES
Mr Cavendish Is everything
alright

Inside she sees an unmoving figure under the blankets

Mr Meeks rocks excitedly as she steps into the room He
tugs on Cavendish’s sleeve

Cavendish turns and Mr Meeks leans into his ear whispering

MR MEEKS
Don’t leave me

Cavendish stunned stares at the pleading Mr Magoo-like
eyes
INT MAH-JONGG HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

All of the men stare at Sonmi waiting for an answer Almost
imperceptibly she shakes her head

SONMI-451
I’m sorry I can not do what you
are asking

There is a disappointed silence

AN-KOR APIS
I understand It would be a
difficult choice for anyone (beat)
But before you call your decision
final there is one last thing I’d
like you to see

He crushes out his cigarette

AN-KOR APIS (CONT’D)
So you understand fully what we are
fighting for

INT CORRIDOR AURORA HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Cavendish turns away from the pleading eyes of Meeks with an
expression that says “I’m sorry”

NOAKES
Mr Cavendish

Across the hall Noakes switches on the lights Something
about the way the figure looks arouses her suspicion and as
she crosses to the bed--

Cavendish leaps from Meeks’ room lunging for the door handle

He yanks the door shut but not before Nurse Noakes grabs it
stopping it from closing

Noakes snarls at him

NOAKES (CONTD)
I knew it was too good to be true

CAVENDISH
You’ll find my comment card on my
nightstand but don’t expect very
favorable marks you cantankerous
witch

They both strain against the handle Cavendish’s grip
slipping slightly

Realizing he is about to lose the tug of war Cavendish
gambles and lets go of the door

Nurse Noakes not expecting the sudden lack of resistance
flies head over heels onto the floor

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
And so adieu The literal
translated from the French meaning
to commend before--

She bull-rushes the door--

But Cavendish quickly scurries slamming it shut rushing
through his speech

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
God

Her fists and catalog of threats beat at the door much to Mr
Meeks’ delight Cavendish flicks the lock

INT HOTEL MEMLING - NIGHT - YEAR 1931
There is a furious pounding on the door

HOTEL MANAGER
Mr Ewing Mr Ewing I must
speak with you Open this door--

The door cracks open revealing Frobisher

FROBISHER
I asked you not to disturb me

HOTEL MANAGER
I do apologize Mr Ewing but this
is a matter of serious consequence

FROBISHER
Yes Go on then

HOTEL MANAGER

It seems the local constable is
rather vexed searching as he is
high and low for this dangerous
ruffian who attacked the great
composer Vyvyan Ayrs Have you
seen the papers Mr Ewing It’s
quite a scandal

Sensing where this is going Frobisher shakes his head

HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
Youre a composer yourself aren’t
you

(MORE)
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
They say this Robert Frobisher
that’s his name is also a composer-

FROBISHER
What do you want

HOTEL MANAGER
The constable asked to search my
rooms I know how hard you are
working so I told him there was no
one on the third floor It costs
quite a bit of money to keep an
entire floor empty

Frobisher pulls out his purse and empties it

He takes the money admiring Frobisher’s waistcoat

Frobisher begins removing it while the manager smiles

INT LUISA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY - YEAR 1973

FROBISHER
That’s everything I have

HOTEL MANAGER
That is the most beautiful
waistcoat

JAVIER (VO)
So you think these letters are the
key

Luisa pours herself a cup of coffee

Javier is still on the couch looking intently at the

letters

LUISA REY
No Not really

JAVIER
But the old guy had these letters
the night they offed him so they
gotta be important

LUISA REY
They were to him

Luisa grabs a spoon for her fruit salad

JAVIER
But if they’re not important why do
you keep reading them

He notices something and picks up a pencil

LUISA REY
I don’t know maybe I’m just
trying to understand something

He begins scribbling with the pencil

JAVIER
What

LUISA REY
Why we keep making the same
mistakes over and over

She crosses to the couch with her salad and her coffee

JAVIER
Maybe you should ask Megan

She freezes

LUISA REY
What

JAVIER
Do you know a Megan

LUISA REY
Yeah that’s his niece But how
did you know that I didn’t tell
you that

He holds up the back of the envelope that he was rubbing his
pencil against highlighting “Megan Sixsmith” and her Hawaii
address

JAVIER
Looks like he mailed her something
the night he died Probably used
the envelope he was keeping these
letters in

Her jaw is on the floor

JAVIER (CONTD)
Come on Luisa First rule of
mystery writing a good clue always
leads to another clue

She rushes at him kissing him grabbing the envelope

LUISA REY

As the car pulls up Veronica rushes to meet them

VERONICA

too dangerous to move her

Johns Hotchkiss’ wife grabs him and hauls him into the

He ducks just as they rush by heading up the stairs As soon
as they are out of sight Cavendish bolts outside
EXT AURORA HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Cavendish climbs behind the wheel of the luxury SUV It has
been a while

He tries to re-acclimate himself with the basics while Ernie
heaves their suitcases haphazardly into the back

CAVENDISH
Right Yes I see-- No wait-- Ah--
No

Veronica’s door slams as Ernie jumps into the passenger seat
He looks at Cavendish

Cavendish nods and reaches for the key in the ignition

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
I-- I don’t--

ERNIE
What are you waiting for

CAVENDISH
No key

Cavendish starts to panic

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
No ruddy key--

the floor

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
Can you hot-wire it

ERNIE
Dont be soft

CAVENDISH
Think of something You’re the

They see Withers running down the nightlit corridor from the
dining room annex with two Hotchkisses close behind

Ernie punches the automatic locks
CAVENDISH
We’re done for
EXT LUISA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY - YEAR 1973

Luisa exits the building She checks her watch then hurries
down the sidewalk

We watch her from inside a car A pair of gloved hands take
hold of the steering wheel The driver pulls the car out and
begins to follow her

EXT AURORA HOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2009
Withers flings open the front door leaping down the steps

VERONICA

Cavendish pulls down on the visor the Range Rover key
dropping into his lap

Yeeeeee-sss

Cavendish sees them coming fast his fingers fumbling dropping
the key

Withers flies head-over-ass on a frozen puddle--

Just as Cavendish bangs his head on the steering wheel the
horn sounding

VERONICA
Hurry Tim hurry

Withers yanks at the locked door

WITHERS
I’m gonna flay your arse straight
into a coma if you don’t open this
door Cavendish

The Hotchkisses surround their car as Cavendish drives the
key home into the ignition

HOTCHKISS
Get your bony carcasses out of my
car or Ill sue — Dammit Ill sue

anyway
The SUV roars to life dashboard blazing with fairy lights
Chet Baker singing Lets Get Lost”
Cavendish cranks the gearshift and the SUV leaps forward

He chuckles as he sees them recede in the rearview mirror
but his smile quickly fades when he catches the figure of Mr
Meeks shuffling out of the vestibule

VERONICA
Oh look it’s Mr Meeks

Cavendish looks back and then ahead at the wide open gate
He groans

CAVENDISH
Oh ruddy bloody hell

He cranks the wheel

ERNIE
What the hell are you doing Are
you daft man

CAVENDISH
I can’t do it

The SUV arcs onto the lawn four wheel drive ripping into the
turf Cavendish leaving his mark a giant “C”--

And they lurch back toward Aurora House the Hotchkisses and
Withers scattering out of the way

ERNIE
All for one and one for all is it

CAVENDISH
Veronica would you unlock the door
for Mr Meeks

The SUV bounds up the walk fishtailing and skidding to a stop
parallel to the door Mr Meeks shuffles in place in
excitement as Veronica opens the side door

VERONICA
Hello Mr Meeks We’re out for a
night time drive

MR MEEKS
I know I know

The car lunges forward again barreling at Hotchkiss who tries
to stand his ground but at the last moment he leaps away

They chortle until they realize what Withers is doing the
chain is in his hands the heavy gate swinging closed

VERONICA
Oh no

CAVENDISH
What now

ERNIE
Ram the gates
CAVENDISH
What
ERNIE

Nice big Range Rover at fifty miles
per hour should do the trick So
long as the center pole isnt sunk
deep the gatesll just fly apart
on impact

CAVENDISH
And if it is sunk deep

ERNIE
Then well fly apart on impact So
foot to the floor Cavendish
Cavendish goes white his life suddenly up for review

VERONICA
How terribly thrilling

The gates rush at them ten eight six car lengths away
Cavendish whispers to himself

CAVENDISH
Sod it Timbo what have you got to
lose
He jams his foot down on the accelerator and--
Wham The vertical bars become diagonal ones as-—-

The gates fly off their hinges

Cavendish’s heart bungee-jumps from throat to bowel and back
again as he grips his intestines shut with all his might

The Range Rover bucks and skids all over the road rubber
tries burning but --

Somehow manages to stay out the ditch and upright
Fog undulates in the headlight beams

CAVENDISH (CONT’D)
We made it

ERNIE
Aye

VERONICA
Absolutely thrilling

EXT CITY STREET - DAY - YEAR 1973

Luisa hurries down the street heading for a small
intersection of a large street and a much smaller warehouse

street

As she steps off the curb a black car waiting down the
throat of the small street peels out

Luisa is on the middle of the street when she realizes what
is about to happen--

She looks like she is ready to die until--
She whips out a gun and fires into the windshield

The car swerves bounces off another parked car and almost
hits her when--

Napier tackles her knocking her to the ground as--
The black car bashes its way into crossing traffic

LUISA REY
It worked

NAPIER
Like hell it did He’s supposed to

Chang nods

From a hidden vantage point they are looking at an enormous
freighter the size of a battleship

The ship’s call letters are stenciled along the prow
GEO-R93

Emblazoned upon its severely distressed hull we also see the
bright cheerful logo of Papa Song Inc

A transport arrives and Sonmi watches as several of her
Fabricant sisters including a few Sonmis cluster excitedly

SONMI-451 (CONT’D)
They believe they are going to

music pouring out of him like blood from an open vein

FROBISHER (VO)

bullet passed through killing
little more than his appetite yet
he’s out for blood Will have to
pay the piper eventually but not

Wearing the white robes of the Aides Sonmi and Chang make
their way down into the ship--

While all around them is a haunting beautiful chorus of
singing voices

FROBISHER (VO)
Would rather become music

Smiling Fabricants wait in lines winding like a coiled
bowel singing their Hymns of Freedom and Xultation

EXT THE VALLEY - DAY - YEAR 2321

Branches slash at his skin and clothes as Zachry reaches the
perimeter of the village Smoke turns everything into a kind
of hazy dream

He runs past a burning house--

On the fence post a severed head cries soundlessly

INT PAPA SONG’S FRIGHTER - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

Chang leads her to the Observation deck a series of catwalks
above rows of small almost empty rooms

In each there is a chair in the center Two Aides work each
room

Sonmi watches as the next Fabricant in line is escorted into
the room It is a Sonmi model

The second Aide prepares a device that swings around like a
dentist armed-tool but is shaped like a partial helmet

The Fabricant is seated in the chair

AIDE
Just relax This is to remove your
collar
The Sonmi beams
SONMT-351

Just as Papa Song promised
The Aide smiles and nods as the device is fitted to her head

The operating Aide hits a button and with a sharp “clack” a
metal bolt is driven through the center of the Fabricant’s
forehead killing her instantly

With a factory worker’s sense of routine they finish their
work cleaning the chair pulling the next helmet into place
while the other one lifts the Sonmi off her feet

She dances in the air swinging like a side of beef as the
conveyered helmet bears her body through a flapped doorway

SONMI-451
(whispers)
Where are they taking her

EXT BAILEY DWELLING - DAY
A Kona horse remains outside the house The horse bristles as
he nears it

He stalks towards the front yard when he sees--
Rose dead laying in a pool of blood

Like a reoccurring nightmare he cannot escape he stumbles
towards her body

Anguish wracks his heart

His only remaining thought is of his niece

ZACHRY

INT PAPA SONG’S SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT - YEAR 2144

The space is vast perhaps a third of the belly of the
enormous ship the slaughterhouse sprawls out below them as
if it had no end

A few workers and an army of conveyor belt robots wield
scissors sword-saws and varying tools for stripping
rending and grinding

With assembly-line efficiency they snip collars strip
clothes peel skin offcut hands and feet and vacuum out the
offal

It is perhaps the sound that disturbs Sonmi the most

SONMT-451
I don’t understand

CHANG
Recycled Fabricants are a cheap
source of protein The genomics
industry demands huge quantities of
liquefied biomatter for wombtanks
and more importantly to sustain

death throes expelling every drop
of poison Drink this final
purgative to expel its calcified
remains Come on handsomely does

Lightning strikes outside as the ship is rocked by the
approaching storm

He hears a male voice grumbling Then silence again

Someone is still in the house He holds his spiker ready to
attack

Stalking through the house he sees the intruder passed out
in the storeroom having drank all of their dandelion wine--

A KONA WARRIOR

As far as Zachry knows this is the man who killed his
sister

He knows what he is going to do

The spiker flashes as Zachry fits it beneath the warrior’s
throat

The blue vein pulses waiting but something is wrong
The world seems to freeze as Zachry hears the Abbesses words
ABBESS (0S)

“Enemys sleepin’ don’t slit that
throat”

His mind goes to war with every instinct in his body

Autua smiles when he sees Ewing and tries the enter

AUTUA

Goose stops him

GOOSE

in his treatment The next few
hours will determine if he will

around him You probably infected
him to begin with He begged me to
please and I quote “keep that
dirty nigger away from me” So
please kindly respect his wishes

Autua is too stunned to do anything as Goose slams the door

Goose turns already knowing the look of horror upon Ewing’s
face

Ewing’s mouth works uselessly

GOOSE (CONTD)
What’s that Ewing How shall I
comprehend if you drool and dribble
so

He laughs his mask completely dropped

GOOSE (CONT’D)
Let me hazard a guess then
Something in the key of “Oh Henry
how could you do this to me I
thought we were friends”

He stoops and picks up the alembic

GOOSE (CONTD)
Unfortunately you are wrong Adam
Wrong like Horrox and your silly
father-in-law There is only one
rule that binds all people one
governing principle that defines
every relationship on God’s green
earth

He sits beside Ewing again his teeth looming over the
helpless Ewing

Do Eat”
INT BAILEY DWELLING - DAY - YEAR 2321

Zachry stares at the Kona rage and hate boiling his blood

He screams sinking the knife deep into the warriors throat
whose eyes snap open--

The blade saws through the gristle of the larynx blood
bubbling as he tries to shout
EXT CITY STREET - DAY - YEAR 1973

The car roars after Napier and Luisa like a predatory animal
smashing into dumpsters sparks flying metal shrieking--

The front grill of the old sedan gleaming like teeth

INT THE PROPHETESS - DAY - YEAR 1846
Goose presses his knee against his chest pinning him

GOOSE
Why you ask

He pulls out a pen knife

GOOSE (CONT’D)
‘Tis absurdly simple

Using the knife he slices off a button from Ewing’s lovely
waistcoat He inspects the button finds it to his liking
and smiles a toothy yellow smile
GOOSE (CONTD)

There is money in your trunk and I

want it so I have killed you for

it
EXT CITY STREET - DAY - YEAR 1973

Bill Smoke leans out of his window firing his gun as Napier
drags Luisa around a corner--

Into a dead end

NAPIER
Shit

The car comes screeching around the corner as they race up a
flight of stairs to a warehouse door

The door opens and they rush inside

Bill Smoke stops the car and walks briskly after them

INT BAILEY DWELLING - DAY - YEAR 2321

The Kona lies soaked in his own blood

Zachry suddenly sees movement in the corner of the room The
floor is moving ever so softly Slowly he sneaks closer
There’s a secret door in the ground hard to identify as it
blends in with the earth and dust around it

His spear ready to be thrown he yanks it open--

Revealing Catkin trembling with fear hiding in a little
hole underneath the door

They fall into each other’s arms tears flooding down their
faces when they hear more horses

Zachry ducks and crawls to the window

Four more KONA are gathered around the empty horse They
begin calling a name Whistling

Zachry looks at the dead man Catkin sees him too Zachry
hushes her back into her den

When he looks back out the window he sees the Kona coming
towards the house

He looks for a place to hide slithering into a cupboard just
as two of the Kona enter

Immediately they find the body Zachry listens to their
angry shouts boots begin pounding through the house

The darkness of his cramped box is filled with the sound of
violence as the warriors tear through smashing and
destroying what little the Bailey’s owned

From the crack of light and the proximity of sound he knows
one of them is just outside the door

He holds his breath He prays It is not enough--

The cupboard opens the moment their eyes meet Zachry knows
he is dead

INT INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY - YEAR 1973

A sparse reception area is lit by a single tube a tomb of

flies A black-eyed young Mexican woman swoops from nowhere
and flutters into Napier’s face brandishing her nail-file

MEXICAN WOMAN
No ‘llegals here No ‘llegals
here Bossaway Bossaway Come back
‘notherday

The noise from the back is monolithic

NAPIER
I’m not an inspector We need
help

A poodle wanders out of its cardboard bed and begins sniffing
at Napier

The woman responds with machine-gun Spanish talking to
Napier and the dog simultaneously

NAPIER (CONT’D)
I don’t understand--

Luisa jumps in

LUISA REY
(in perfect Spanish)
We don’t want the police to get
involved We understand your
situation but there is a man you is
trying to kill me and we really
need your help

The woman looks at her unsure of what she should do

INT THE PROPHETESS - EWING’S ROOM - DAY - YEAR 1846
Goose smiles pinching Ewing’s nose forcing his mouth open

GOOSE
I commend you for a noble
constitution Adam Most of my
patrons succumb to my ministrations
long before it comes to a drama
such as this but enough’s enough
it is time for you to die

He holds the alembic to his lips and begins to pour

The lantern sways nervously as the wind howls and rain lashes
the ship

The poison fills Ewing’s mouth when the door explodes open
Autua steps into the room a club in his clenched fist

AUTUA
Get away from Mr Ewing or I kill
you
Goose rises affably

GOOSE
This is a simple misunderstanding--

He attacks throwing the alembic but Autua is too fast--

Closing the distance bashing Goose in the face shattering
his nose

Goose goes down in the cramped space as Ewing spits the
poison from his mouth

AUTUA
Mr Ewing

Autua rushes to Ewing

AUTUA (CONT’D)
Gotta flush you out

He starts to lift him when Ewing sees-—-

Goose rise up blood streaming from his ruined nose his eyes
like a rabid dog about to attack--

INT INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY - YEAR 1973

Bill Smoke shoves through the door into the small reception
area Napier and Luisa are gone There are three doors in
the room

The Mexican flaps her hands with her long elaborately painted
nails at him as if shooing flies mixing Spanish and heavily-
accented English
SMOKE
Two people came in here which way
did they go
Her poodle becomes immediately agitated and begins barking

MEXICAN WOMAN

We treat workers good (more
Spanish) No need Union (more
Spanish)

Smoke pulls out his gun

SMOKE
Which way did they go
The gun sends her into hysterics The dog gets even more
upset Combined with the roar of the hidden machines Smoke

can’t hear himself think

SMOKE (CONT’D)
Shut up Shut the fuck up

The yapping of the dog is like aluminium on teeth She is
telling him who her boss knows when--

He shoots the dog
She freezes too shocked to even understand

SMOKE (CONT’D)
Stupid fucking wetback

She sinks to her knees crying out in terrible pain while he
pushes past her and enters the third door
EXT BAILEY DWELLING - DAY
Zachry is thrown onto the ground His hands are bound behind
him Rose laying a few feet away

An angry tattooed warrior puts a boot to his neck
KONA WARRIOR
For what you done we ought blade
off your hands’n’feet blade off
your cock an leave you for the
flies‘n’rats’ feastin’ But

Another Kona finishes heating a branding iron

Zachry sees the orange-red glowing piece of metal and begins
to struggle

Zachry screams as the brand is pressed deep into his cheek

INT THE PROPHETESS - EWING’S ROOM - DAY - YEAR 1846

Goose attacks shrieking like an animal bashing Autua who
collapses onto Ewing

Before Goose can finish the job the ship heaves violently
throwing everyone against the far wall

Autua recovers as he and Goose have at one another in the
chaos of the rolling pitching waves and disorienting lamp
light

Goose flails after several spilled vials from his bag as
Autua finds his club and is about to finish the fight but--

Goose hurls a liquid that burns him

The killer leaps on top using the club to crush Autua’s wind
pipe
Autua looks past Goose
AUTUA
No Missa Ewing Don’t Get out
of here
Goose smiles blood smeared across his teeth
GOOSE
You got a lot to learn about lying
nigger Ewing can’t even stand
let alone help you--

But Ewing is standing and more than that he raises the
metal lock box that Goose wanted and--

Swings with every fibre of his being falling as he strikes-—-

The sound of metal breaking against bone like a crack of
thunder as--

Goose collapses

EXT BAILEY DWELLING - DAY
A noose hangs around Zachry’s neck tying him to the back of
the Kona’s horse The body of the man he killed is tied over
the horse beside him

He seems almost resigned to his fate when he sees the Kona
throw a torch onto the thatched roof

It immediately bursts into flames Terror clutches his
heart

ZACHRY
Catkin

Fire and smoke consume the small house as Zachry writhes

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
Oh no S’my fault S’all my fault

INT SWEATSHOP - DAY - YEAR 1973

An underworld sweatshop clattering with five hundred sewing
machines Flakes of textile are suspended in the viscous
heat haloing the naked bulbs hanging over each machinist
Luisa and Napier skirt the outer walkway in a rapid semi-
crouch Limp Donald Ducks and crucified Scooby-Doos have
their innards stitched one by one row by row pallet by
pallet Each woman keeps her eyes fixed on the needle plates
so Luisa and Napier cause little commotion

They enter a large storeroom Rows aisles and ten-foot tall
boxes conceal the true dimensions of the room

Napier is considering if they should go back when gunshots
make up his mind

They weave through the maze of cardboard as Smoke chases
firing his gun

A door opens to a stairwell down They leap down the single
flight to a mechanical service tunnel The door of the
stairwell bangs above them as Smoke gains

They race down the hall which has several heavy metal doors
trying each one They are all locked

Smoke enters the hall at the other end There is one last
door remaining Napier grabs the handle--

It’s locked

There’s no way out

EXT BAILEY DWELLING - DAY
Zachry thrashes against his ropes screaming as the house is
swallowed by flames

The Kona sneer as they mount their horses and dig their spurs
when--

Zachry hears a “ksss—-ksss” sound and the warrior falls off
his horse--

Two red holes in his forehead

The others react but the sound continues like bees zipping
by--

Two more drop with holes punched through different parts of
there bodies

The last one slings a rock and Meronym is knocked from her
perch in a tree

She falls with a terrible thud her thin silver weapon
bouncing away

Zachry tries to get free but can’t
The Kona grabs the weapon before Meronym can recover
He lifts it aiming it at her and pulls the trigger-—-

Exploding his own head because he had the futuristic gun
backwards

Meronym stands brushing herself off

MERONYM
I’m getting too old for this shit

ZACHRY
Catkin She’s’n th’house

MERONYM
Oh no

There’s not much left of it but she runs straight into the
burning house

INT INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - BASEMENT - YEAR 1973
Aiming his gun Smoke walks towards them

SMOKE

trusted Joe

NAPIER
Look who’s talking

SMOKE
I’m completely loyal to whoever
writes the biggest check That’s
the business we’re in

NAPIER
Maybe I’m tired of the business

He smiles and lifts the gun

SMOKE
Well enjoy your retirement

He is about to shoot when the Mexican woman steps out of an
alcove leading to one of the other doors

In her hand is a monkey wrench which she brings down on the
back of Smoke’s head crumpling him like a pushed pile of
bricks

Ten more blows of extreme ferocity follow each one making
Luisa flinch

She leans over Smoke’s pulped face

Kona he cuts himself free

Just as he stands Meronym stumbles out of the collapsing
house--

Catkin in her arms

A cry bursts from him like a bird taking flight He rushes
to his sister engulfing her with his arms

With gratitude wetting his eyes he looks up at Meronym

ZACHRY
Thank you

She nods

In the warm cave of a bar a crowd watches TV soccer ina
distant fluorescent time zone In the eighty-first minute
England is a goal down to Scotland

Without taking his eyes off the TV the barman delivers Ernie
their drinks by sense of touch alone

The foursome edge their way through the crowd and take their
seats in an alcove A cyclone of despair suddenly sweeps
through the bar as England is awarded a penalty

Tribalism electrifies the air

CAVENDISH

He checks his watch calculating distances and speeds in his

His mouth opens to speak but the room is drowned in a howl of
tribal grief England has tied the match

In the din the entrance door opens and the hulking figure of
Mr Withers fills the frame His Gestapo eyes settle on the
group as Johns Hotchkiss and an orderly appear beside him

Cavendish lets out a breath of resignation

EXT CARTPATH - DAY - YEAR 2321

Zachry rides with Catkin as their horses charge down the road
in full gallop

As they charge towards the edge of the Valley they pass right
by a large party of looting Kona

The Kona are stunned for a moment until the leader bellows--

KONA WARRIOR
After them

INT THE HANGED EDWARD - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Veronica sighs a frail sigh as Withers and Hotchkiss surround
them

HOTCHKISS
Your little joy ride is over

Withers clamps a huge hand on Cavendish’s shoulder

WITHERS
Youre going to be sorry in ways
you can’t even imagine

VERONICA
Oh bother I had so hoped to see
the wild mountain thyme all across

Grimly Mr Meeks stands-- and lets out a biblical bellow

The TV viewers drop their conversations and look Even
Withers stops in his tracks

Mr Meeks climbs onto the bar and roars an SOS to his
universal fraternity

Hotchkiss has had enough and begins crossing the room when
his path is blocked by a pool cue

HOTCHKISS
Now you just look here you grebo
you can go shag your bloody sporran
if you think—

Violence erupts the pub filling with the sound of knuckle
and bone on flesh

One of Hotchkiss’ teeth splashes into Cavendish’s Kilmagoon
fifteen feet away Cavendish fishes it out for a keepsake

As the pandemonium escalates the foursome gulp their drinks
down then scurry out the back exit

EXT CARTPATH - DAY - YEAR 2321

A bolt sizzles past Zachry’s head

The chasing Kona fire crossbows from their galloping horses--

Meronym hefts her rifle The air crackles as she fires twice
leaving smoking fist-sized holes in the two slavers

With Catkin holding tight to him Zachry kicks his horse’s
sides as the Kona thunder behind them in hot pursuit

As their horses clear a ridge we see up ahead the brilliant
blue Pololu River where the road pitches down and meets a
decaying bridge of worn planks and rusting steel

They race for it and as they do the sun clears a cloud bank
and the colors of the bridge light up as if aflame in orange
and bronze
The Abbesss final prophecy pulses in Zachry’s brain
ABBESS VOICE (VO)
Bridge a’burnin’ your path lies
below

He shouts to Meronym

ZACHRY
We can’t be crossin’ that bridge

MERONYM
What

She twists in the saddle

ZACHRY
We ain’t s’posed to use that
bridge

MERONYM

Over there’s our meetin with the
Prescient ship That bridge aint
safe

ZACHRY
No
(he can’t explain)
Sonmi tell’d me not t’cross it

Meronym’s face crinkles as she stops her horse
MERONYM
Andid Sonmi know we got a furyin
swarm oKona on our tail

ZACHRY
We can ford the river down there

He points down a fork in the road where the path meets the
water

The hoofs drum louder as the Kona close

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
I trus’ you Now you trus’ me

Meronym makes her decision and follows Zachry down the path
away from the bridge

The footing is slick and rocky though and it slows their
flight

As they begin to ford the river they look back to see the
first of the Kona converging on the bridge The warriors wail
as they see them and raise their crossbows

The water of the Pololu already up to their horses neck is
numbingly cold Crossbow bolts sizzle angrily around them as
more Kona horsemen arrive

Zachry curses himself as the Kona charge onto the bridge

Meronym also curses in her own language as she watches them
cross with nothing but a slight moan of timber until--

Just before they reach the other side an explosion of
tearing shrieking fibers fills the air the bridge giving
way--

Collapsing under the weight of the war party

The Kona horsemen fall in an avalanche of rent metal and
debris plunging to their deaths twenty meters below

Zachry howls beating the water standing up on his horse as
he laughs and bays like a bear that has defended its home

He hides around the corner watching as a young man in a
natty gabardine jacket emerges—-

She smiles and for a moment she is radiant

SONMI-451
Yes I do

ARCHIVIST
Why are you smiling

SONMI-451
Because very soon all of this is
going to end A door will close
but another will open and I believe
that when it does I will find him
there waiting for me

EXTINT EWING’S HOME - DAY

The door opens and Ewing is half-carried by Autua into the
vestibule

Ewing’s wife TILDA sees him and rushes to him
He collapses into her arms

He cries holding her never more grateful for any moment in
his life

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - YEAR 2144
The door opens and two Enforcers enter

ARCHIVIST
On behalf of my Ministry and
myself I thank you for this
interview

She nods as the Enforcers unlock her cuffs

ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
If I may ask one last question You
had to know the whole scheme
engineered by Union would fail

SONMI-451
of course This is exactly what
General Apis laid out in that room
to me This was my destiny

ARCHIVIST
What To be executed

SONMI-451
Yes

ARCHIVIST
Why

SONMI-451

If I had remained invisible the
truth would stay hidden I
couldn’t allow that

The Enforcers unlock her cuffs and lift her out of the chair

ARCHIVIST
And what if no one believes this
“truth”
SONMI-451
That can’t happen
ARCHIVIST
Why not
SONMI-451

Because someone already does

Sonmi smiles as the Enforcers take her away

INT THOMAS MOORE’S OFFICE - EVENING - YEAR 1846

Ewing enters using a cane He looks better but not
completely recovered

Haskell Moore his father-in-law stands

MOORE
Good God Adam what are you doing
here The doctor said at least
three weeks in bed

EWING
I’m sorry but this couldn’t wait

Ewing sets his briefcase down
EWING (CONT’D)
I’ve done a lot of thinking about
my life sir and I’ve come to
certain conclusions

He removes the sealed contract from Horrox
MOORE
Is that the contract for Reverend
Horrox

EWING

It is indeed

MOORE
I could have sent a boy--

Ewing holds the contract to the candle flame

MOORE (CONTD)
What the devil are you doing

EWING
I owe my life to a self-freed
slave I cannot in good conscience
participate in this kind of
business any longer

MOORE
What Are you insane You’ve
just cost me a fortune Goddamn
you If you weren’t my daughter’s
husband I would fire you on the
spot

EWING
Not necessary sir Here is my
resignation

He hands him a letter

MOORE
When Tilda learns what you have
done ---

EWING

She’s outside in the carriage She
came to demonstrate her support

Moore throws back the curtain to see his daughter Tilda
and wave from their carriage Autua is beside her

MOORE
The poison must have rotted your
brain

EWING

Perhaps If it has I recommend it
I’ve not felt this good in years

smile

MOORE
And just what in blazes do you
think are you going to do

EWING
Spend my life shaping a world that
I want my son to inherit not one
that I fear he shall inhabit

MOORE
Listen to me Adam Listen for the
sake of my daughter and grandson
if not your own There is a
natural order to this world and
those who try to upend it do not
fare well If you go to Georgia
and try to tell upstanding people
that they are merely white-washed
niggers and that niggers are black-
washed whites you and your entire
family will be spat on You will be
beaten Shot at Lynched or
crucified And for what Adam
For what No matter what you do
it will never amount to anything
more than a single drop ina
limitless ocean

Ewing stands at the door
EWING
Yet what is any ocean but a
multitude of drops

He shuts the door behind him

INT CAVENDISH’S STUDY - NIGHT - YEAR 2009

Close as his empty glass of wine is filled Cavendish
finishes his memoirs

CAVENDISH (VO)
In vino veritas Middle age is
flown but it is attitude not
years that condemns one to the
ranks of the Undead or else prof-
fers salvation

A woman comes around to the back of his chair and massages
his shoulders

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
Outside fat snowflakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls
Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in
Vermont I shall beaver away in
exile far from the city that knit-
ted my bones

Cavendish finishes and takes her hand leading her around to
sit with him It is Ursula

CAVENDISH (VO) (CONTD)
Unlike Solzhenitsyn I shant be
alone

He pours her a glass and they smile and drink

sighs

ADAM
‘Bout time Can we go home now

Around the fire are a dozen young faces children and grand-
children of obviously mixed races

ZACHRY
Oh yay Go Ge’on then y’damn
sluggabuggahs Try to tell you
what’s what-- Ge’on

The kids tumble and dash away heading towards a distant
house glowing warmly

Beyond the home there are the twinkling spires of a future-
city

Zachry remains behind He looks up Two moons one nearly
full the other almost new gleam with pale purple light

MIRO a young girl who looks like what Meronym must have
looked like as a child lingers with him

MIRO
You like it out here don’t you
Grampy
He shrugs
ZACHRY
Supposin’ it ‘minders me’a my
Valley

She stares with him at the star field beyond

MIRO
Which is the earth

He points to a bright star

ZACHRY
That un there The blue shimmerer

As they gaze upwards we see the back of Zachry’s head which
was covered by his hair when he was younger there near the
top of his spine is a comet-shaped birthmark

ZACHRY (CONT’D)
Come on Gettin’ cold

She helps him up

MIRO
Are you gonna tell us ‘bout the
woahsome ship and the big sleep and
all the nex’nexs

ZACHRY
Nay your Grammy tells the

He takes her hand and they head away from us towards their
home

MIRO
