1 EXT BLOUNT RANCH LANDSCAPE NIGHT

A nightscape

CHARLIE (0S)

Hey This is the Sisters brothers
The Commodore sent us He knows you
have Blount Hand him over and the
rest of you will live

In the background at first very far away flashes of gunfire
and detonations As we move in we make out the shadow of a
farm at times briefly lit up by long 45- caliber flames
Screams

1A EXT BLOUNT RANCH LANDSCAPE NIGHT
The gunfire has ended

Two men step out of the night in silence

Eli Sisters 40 his face heavy and gentle Charlie Sisters
35 thin and juvenile The Sisters Brothers

They reload their guns Spare precise gestures Eli covers
Charlie They reach the verandah The house is silent

There are two bodies sprawled out on the floor of the
verandah Charlie rolls them over looks at them and shakes
his head ‘no’ He points to the door Eli kicks it in
Charlie slips inside

2 INT BLOUNT RANCH NIGHT

Gunfire lights up the room Two guns fire back A silhouette
collapses

Silence and darkness Eli scratches a match and lights two
lamps He hands one to Charlie They walk around the room
stepping over corpses Four of them

Lamp light on the corpses’ faces One man is still breathing
Charlie sits him up

CHARLIE
Where’s Blount

Blood froths on the man’s lips Charlie shakes him

CHARLIE
Blount

The man coughs Charlie finishes him off

Something on the ceiling catches Eli’s attention dust
trickling from between the planks

3 INT BLOUNT RANCH ATTIC NIGHT

Up in the attic dry and dark A scared man cowers behind
bales of hay Blount

His hands scratch at the wooden slats of the roof ripping

away straw and adobe

He hears footsteps on the steps of the ladder

He groans In the hole of the roof a chunk of sky appears
the moon

Footsteps on the attic floor

Blount slips through the opening

4 EXT RANCH ROOF-NIGHT

rolls falls from the roof

lies on the ground the wind knocked out of him He
sits up

CHARLIE
Blount

Blount turns around Charlie barely aims Shoots
Blount collapses

Charlie shoots twice to finish him off then turns to the
ranch and reloads

ELI (0S)
Charlie Charlie
Suddenly Eli’s voice is heard from above Charlie steps
away He looks up and sees his brother in the hole in the
roof pointing to something

ELI
The barn

He hears something galloping behind him He turns around
clutching his gun A horse on fire gallops through the
landscape

5A EXT BARN BLOUNT’S RANCH-NIGHT

The barn is on fire Through the flames we see the
silhouettes of horses panicking

Shielding their faces the two brothers try to penetrate the
inferno

CHARLIE
What are you doing

ELI
I’m not walking home

CHARLIE
Eli Don’t be fucking stupid
let’s go They’re just fucking
horses
On his last try Eli comes running back out with his coat on
fire He rolls around on the ground to put out the flames
Charlie helps him

Helpless they hear their horses neigh in terror

5B EXT BARN BLOUNT FARM-NIGHT
In the background the barn is still burning
ELI
How many you think we’ve killed
CHARLIE

I don’t know six seven

ELI
Well we fucked that up real good

They disappear into the night
6A EXT COMMODORE’S MANSION-DAY
It is gray and cold Hard to tell if it is dawn or dusk

The dark silhouette of a huge Neo-Gothic building On the
gate a sign with the owner’s coat of arms a sun shining on
a globe stamped with an anchor

It is the Commodore’s mansion

On the other side of the white fence Eli Sisters is waiting
on a low-backed horse slumped like a sagging sofa - “Tub”
Eli is dressed sloppily his stomach protrudes over his belt
He looks at the horse attached beside him a superb Spanish
Barb horse large and muscled - “Nimble” He shakes his head
in disbelief

He looks back at the manor house A silhouette appears at the
first floor window It is his brother Charlie in the glow of
oil-burning lamps

Then another silhouette appears beside him a smaller white-
haired man dressed in black the Commodore

6B EXT COMMODORE’S MANSION-DAY

Charlie is coming back He looks dirty and sloppy too but
thin and naturally elegant

ELI
What did the Commodore say Did you
mention the horses

CHARLIE
Let’s go get a drink

Eli tries to catch up with his brother

7AINT OREGON CITY - PIG KING SALOON-DAY

The brothers are sitting in the back of a saloon Not many
customers at the bar

Charlie is drinking brandy Eli is drinking less Charlie
speaks softly

CHARLIE
He said if there’d been a lead man
we wouldn’t have had problems at
the Blount ranch
He says for the next job we need
to have a lead man
ELI
What’s it mean about money

CHARLIE
More for me

ELI
No My money I mean Same as
before

CHARLIE

Well no Less obviously
Eli makes a face Charlie pours him a glass to keep him calm

ELI
The Commodore wants to pay for a
lead man that’s fine But it’s bad
business to short the man
underneath

CHARLIE
You’re not asking what the job is

ELI
No

CHARLIE
Ill tell you anyways We have to
go South and find Morris

ELI
The Commodore’s John Morris
And why do we have to find this
Morris

Charlie downs his glass he leans over to Eli

CHARLIE
He’s after a prospector named
Hermann Kermit Warm

ELI
Great He can find him and kill
him End of story

CHARLIE
Morris is a scout not a killer
The mission is Morris finds
Warm he holds him we come in and
finish the job That’s the mission

Eli thinks it over
ELI
What about the horses

CHARLIE
What’s your goddamn problem with
the horses

ELI
The Commodore told us he would get
us new horses

CHARLIE
Isn’t that what he did

ELI
No For you he got a new horse For
me he made room in his stable and
got rid of some horse meat

CHARLIE
Don’t you think we can talk about
this later

ELI
No I don’t need the horse later I
need it now for the job

The bartender comes to take the bottle and get paid

CHARLIE
The horse is fine stop being a
baby

ELI

Is it the words “go halves” that
you don’t like
To the bartender seeing that Charlie isn’t budging
ELI
The lead’s man paying
7B EXT OREGON CITY SALOON STREET DAY
They cross the street to their horses

We discover the town a prosperous thriving western city
8 EXT SISTERS HOUSE DAY

In a prairie a small log cabin Their horses are tied in
front

9 INT SISTERS HOUSE DAY

The inside is rudimentary Each brother is in what serves as
his room packing for the trip Charlie’s room looks like a
sty Eli’s is clean and tidy

On one of the “living room” walls is a framed landscape cut
out of a newspaper Charlie shifts the frame to uncover a
hiding place He gropes inside and pulls out a few bills
then a few gold pieces He counts them and places them in a
large wallet

woe ue
Eli cuts his hair in front of a dusty mirror His long hair
falls on the ground strand by strand He calls for Charlie’s
help
ELI
Hey come cut the back of this for
me Just cut it off

Charlie smiles at Eli’s face in the mirror

CHARLIE
You look funny like that

woe soe

Eli takes a red woolen shawl from the dresser drawer and
folds it with particular care

10 EXT SISTERS HOUSE DAY

Eli mounts Tub who seems to buck under his weight

He digs his spurs in the horse’s flank the horse balks He
joins Charlie

The two men leave the log cabin and prairie behind

11 EXT RELAY STATION 1 DAY

A relay station further south

Sitting at a small table in the shade of the verandah a man
is writing a letter His clothes are elegant and understated
He is well groomed fine-featured and strong A handsome man
John Morris 35

MORRIS (VO)
Dear solicitor my friend
My father had vowed to do two
things First to do whatever it
takes to ruin my life And second
to disinherit me He kept his word
for the first Not for the second
It surprises me and I attribute it
to his declining health In any
case I want nothing of this
inheritance not the titles the
factory the buildings or the
Westwood property I want nothing
I’1l be back in Washington before
winter We will deal with all these
details then
I shake your hand
Your friend John Morris

Across from him the landscape pulses under the sun John
folds his letter

12 INTEXT RELAY STATION 1 DAY

The letter disappears into a big leather sack marked “Mail”

MORRIS
When did the last wagon train pass
through

OWNER
Yesterday

MORRIS

I’m looking for a guy named Warm
Hermann Kermit Warm 5 foot 6

lean dark skin no bags or gear
He’s traveling in a wagon train

The owner did not see Warm

13 EXT RELAY STATION 1 DAY

John Morris heads back to his curly horse built to ride long
and hard They head down the trail

The mare immediately launches into a perfect half-gallop

Torso straight feet in the stirrups John Morris rides off
like a Mongol horseman

14 EXT OREGON COUNTRYSIDE DAY

Tall grass blowing in the wind

On their horses side by side the brothers slowly cross a
large sloping landscape

CHARLIE
Gorgeous country isn’t it Odd we
haven’t seen anyone
since this morning

ELI
If we’d stayed on the trail wed
have come across more
people

CHARLIE
Yeah but it’s nothing like what
they say Supposedly the whole
world is searching for gold
Honestly

15A EXT COUNTRYSIDE CAMP SISTERS 1 NIGHT

They set up camp and finish eating by the fire

ELI
What did this Hermann Warm do

CHARLIE
He stole something from the
Commodore

Eli thinks it over

ELI
Don’t you find it strange all
these men foolish enough to steal
from such a dangerous man

Charlie has no opinion

ELI
How do they even steal anything at
all We know how cautious the
Commodore is

CHARLIE
Caution has nothing to do with it
He does business in every corner of
the country and even overseas A
man can’t be everywhere at once It
stands to reason he’d be
victimized

ELI
Victimized

CHARLIE
Yes victimized

ELI
The Commodore is «victimized»

CHARLIE
What would you call it If a man is
forced to protect his fortune with
the likes of us

ELI
Not “victimized”

CHARLIE
You’re not going to start
nitpicking over every word What’s
your problem Are you upset

CHARLIE

You’re upset that I’m the lead man
Is that it If that’s itjust say
so But stop splitting hairs

ELI

I’m not splitting hairs You’re
using a strange word and I’m
making you take notice

Charlie drops his tin pan and goes to his corner to spread
open his blanket

According to a well-established routine Eli collects the tin
pans and silverware and then stokes the fire

15B EXT COUNTRYSIDE SISTERS CAMP 1

Eli spreads out a first blanket then lays a patchwork quilt
on top He winds his pocket watch puts it next to his
“pillow” and lies down

Nearby Charlie lets out a loud fart

Eli checks his watch and moves the big hand up to the 9

15C EXT MOUNTAIN RIDGE DAY

They climb up a steep path spurring the horses on They stop
at the top and let the horses catch their breath

CHARLIE
Ccould it be Miss Emilia Patridge

ELI
What are you talking about

CHARLIE
It’s the schoolteacher who gave you
that silly red scarf
(imitating him) The one you keep
folding and unfolding in secret

ELI
It’s called a shawl Am I not
entitled to any privacy

CHARLIE
Have you made plans with this Miss
Emilia

ELI
Plans

CHARLIE
To marry her start a family have
children something like
that

ELI

I don’t know Why are you so
interested all of a sudden

CHARLIE
I was wondering about family You
remember how Pa was with Ma

ELI
Yes Charlie I remember

CHARLIE
Makes you think You’re not
scared to reproduce
yourself

CHARLIE
You do realize that our father was
stark-raving mad
and that we got his foul blood in
our veins

ELI
Our father drank Charlie

Charlie looks at him seriously then smiles
CHARLIE
That was his gift to us That

blood That’s why we’re good at
what we do

with a wooden handle He picks it up and studies it

The storekeeper comes by

STOREKEEPER

have

CHARLIE
When we stop what

ELI
Killing people I believe I could
settle into a life like that
Didn’t it seem pleasant in there

CHARLIE
Id die of boredom

ELI
It seemed peaceful enough to me I

well at night You don’t
sleep well at night

23 INT PIONEER TOWN 02 HOTEL ROOM EVENING

Naive black and white drawings illustrating how to use the
toothbrush

A small hotel room

Eli brushes his teeth according to the instructions He is
diligent and excessive as if inventing a style

He sits in front of the window overlooking the street and the
entrance to the saloon

Eli blows into his cupped hands to smell his new breath

24 EXT PIONEER TOWN 02 SALOON STREET NIGHT
Night has fallen
Eli is in the street

He finishes eating something all the while looking out the
corner of his eye at the saloon

Inside Charlie is in the middle of a conversation with a man
in a suit and hat They have both been drinking Charlie
admires the revolver hanging from his belt The man hands it
to him Charlie weighs it in his hand He likes its
proportions When he hands it back his mouth is smiling but
not his eyes

25 EXT PIONEER TOWN 02 TENT ENCAMPMENT NIGHT
Eli wanders through the tents at the town limits There are

people in all kinds of attire speaking all kinds of
languages guttural and crystalline

He notices Russian astrakhan hats and the strange pointy ones
of Shtetl Jews

Leaning over a cauldron a woman sells soup for a few cents
She serves him a bowl He eats

ELI

It’s good Is it vegetables
WOMAN

Bortsch
ELI

I taste dill

WOMAN
Bortsch

The woman does not understand He gives up

He hears chanting from behind He approaches Finishing his
soup he watches a family observe the Sabbath ritual

26 INTEXT HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

Eli is asleep Shouts gunshots coming from the street wake
him up He grabs his gun and runs to the window

Down below in the middle of the street Charlie is teetering
with a gun in each hand

He shoots into the air

CHARLIE
Five Six are you counting
Seven eight Nine Oh where did

you go Where did you go

The saloon and the street empty Silhouettes cautiously hug
the facades The street is now deserted

CHARLIE
You fucking cowards No one wants
to measure themselves up against
Charlie Sisters
No one really

Eli goes back to bed

ELI
Go home you fools

27 INT HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

The noise is coming closer When the door opens Eli turns to
the wall and shuts his eyes The room now echoes with
Charlie’s heavy breathing and groans

CHARLIE (0OS)

And that idiot fast asleep
What good are you
Damn if you weren’t my brother
Id have ditched you ages ago
Even the Commodore wanted to
“Why do you carry around that dead
weight” “Because he’s my
brother I answered
We all have our fucking crosses to
bear He appreciated how loyal
I am “Faith will be repaid with
faith” he said

A beat Then suddenly right next to Eli’s ear the click of
a revolver being cocked Eli opens his eyes and looks at his
brother Above him Charlie’s revolver is aimed at him

CHARLIE
Tst-tst It’s not nice to
fake it
ELI

Go to sleep

CHARLIE
Can I ask you a question brother
Who can have faith in you
Real faith Huh

He lifts his hand sententiously and stumbles off to bed

28 EXT WILLAMETTE VALLEY DAY

They are riding their horses across the Willamette Valley

Eli is sullen Charlie is riding behind slumped over
Nimble’s neck All of a sudden Eli hears a big thump Jaded
he stops Tub

He dismounts and steps toward Charlie lying on the ground
He lifts him up not gently His new outfit is now dirty
Charlie feels nauseousEli turns around He hears Charlie
vomit Eli grabs him roughly and helps him back into the
saddle
CHARLIE
Don’t judge me please Some days
we’re stronger than others

29 EXT WILLAMETTE VALLEY DAY
They are riding one behind the other
Eli remains silent Charlie is feeling a bit better

CHARLIE
You okay

Charlie catches up to ELi

CHARLIE
Are you pouting

No answer

CHARLIE
Is it because I drank

Eli feels Charlie staring at him He stops Tub

ELI
Listen either ride in front or
ride in back but I don’t feel
like talking

CHARLIE
It’s just like I said you’re
pouting You’re ruining the
atmosphere on purpose We could
have had a delightful day and you
took it on yourself to ruin it
Oh fuck it Pout if you want to

He spurs Nimble and takes the lead

CHARLIE
Well if you insist on pouting you
should give it your all Give
us a full pout Eli You must stew
and hate and revisit all the
slights I offered you in childhood
Don’t you forget a single one

Eli smiles slightly

CHARLIE
No you mustn’t smile when pouting
It’s wrong and you
know it’s wrong

30 EXT PIONEER CITY 03 DAY

Heavy fog Another pioneer town on the trail As usual there
is one main street wood houses and store signs

John Morris shakily crosses the muddy street on wooden planks
that have been laid down

31A INT PIONEER CITY 03 SALOON DAY

Morris is having dinner at a table in the back Without
having to look up from his notebook he feels Warm’s presence
at the bar Dirty muddy haggard

MORRIS (VO)
May 17th Wolf Creek I travel
through places that didn’t exist 3
months ago First there are tents
then houses then 2 months later
shops with women fiercely
discussing the price of flour I
found this line by Thoreau “This
town too lies out”

At one point he senses Warm’s shadow by his side

WARM
We’ve seen each other before

MORRIS
No I don’t think so

WARM
You were in Myrtle Creek two days
ago

MORRIS
Yes I was like many other folk

WARM
Are you heading down to San
Francisco

MORRIS
No just to Jacksonville
WARM
Work

MORRIS
Yes work

Warm is now sitting two tables away

MORRIS
And you San Francisco Gold

WARM
Yes like many other folk

A beat Warm looks at him with a strange smile Morris
almost embarrassed

WARM

May I tell you something sir
MORRIS

Of course
WARM

Typically when a man wishes
another man good day he smiles
while facing the other person but
once he passes by the smiles drops
from his face Not you Your smile
remains on your lips after you have
turned away

Warm’s candor and good nature throw Morris for a loop

MORRIS
(embarassed)
Well I I’ve hadn’t noticed
It’s common courtesy

WARM
It’s not only that You take a
genuine pleasure in communing with
others Am I mistaken

MORRIS
I honestly do not know (a beat)

of my associates thereHow are you
making your way south

WARM
I have a seat in a covered wagon

MORRIS
How long do you think till you
reach Frisco

WARM
The question is not how long before
I get there the question is what
state will I be in when I do If I
do To be honest with you my faith
in my hosts is very limited
Theyve rifled through my
belongings several times and every
time I take out my money their
eyes are like daggers

MORRIS
Mr Warm You ought to not endanger
yourself in that way You have to
be more careful than that

WARM
What other choice do I have

MORRIS
You’re never gonna sell this horse
Not at 50 not at 40 She’s a bad
hip anyone’d see that with an eye

A relay station on the trail for horses and stagecoaches
Eli finishes reading the message from Morris

ELI
«Make haste John Morris»

CHARLIE
One good point for Morris even if
I don’t like the “Make haste”
Who does that asshole think he is

He turns to the horse-dealer in charge of the place

CHARLIE
When did they pass through

HORSE DEALER

CHARLIE
Is there a faster way to
Jacksonville off trail

HORSE DEALER
Well it’s rougher to go up the

mountains but you’ll save a couple
of days

They climb switchbacks up a mountain road
A forest looms before them like a dark green wall Their

silhouettes disappear behind the line of trees

36 EXT CAMP SISTERS 2 NIGHT

Eli is woken by groaning He turns toward Charlie He stands
up and leans over him

Tears are flowing from Charlie’s closed eyes He whimpers and
groans in his sleep

Eli feels moved by his brother’s pain He wavers then puts
out his hand to wake him Charlie’s eyes suddenly pop open

CHARLIE
Peek-a-boo

Eli jumps up Charlie bursts out laughing
He clutches his stomach Eli looks peeved Charlie imitates
Eli

ELI
Fool

CHARLIE
I thought you were going to kiss
me

The blankets shake as they laugh uncontrollably

37 EXT FORESTBURN WAGON DAY

They ride tiny among the tall trees Their voices and
hoofbeats echo among the trunks After a beat

CHARLIE
The rain muddied it all up I can’t
see a thing What do you think

ELI
We must be able to pick up the
trail somewhere

They split up

Eli rides alone looking for the trail He turns back from
time to time but no longer sees his brother

He is overtaken by a feeling of dread
He spots some ruts some hoof prints He whistles

ELI
Over here

He continues onward and finds the remains of a wagon an
animal carcass and human bones

He dismounts The wagon has obviously been plundered He
kicks at some pathetic scraps A piece of paper catches his
eye He unfolds it wipes it clean and tries to make out the
writing He hears Charlie arrive He slips the paper into his
jacket and gets back on Tub

37B EXT FORESTINDIANS DAY

They are riding Charlie in front Eli behind deciphers the
letter he found among the debris

ELI (OFF)
“Dear Mother
I feel lonely and the days are long
here My horse has passed and he
was a close friend I think of your
cooking and wonder what I’m doing
here I believe I will come home
soon

(MORE )

ELI (OFF) (CONTD)
I have almost 200 dollars in gold
dust It’s not the pile I’d hoped
for but good enough for now
The smell of smoke in still my
nostrils and I haven’t had a
laughed in such a long time
Mother I think I will leave here
very soon With all my love
Your son”

38 EXT FOREST CAMP SISTERS 3 NIGHT

Smoldering embers in the fire

Eli is asleep wrapped in his patchwork quilt He half- opens
his eyes and sees his brother by the light of the embers his
gun across his lap A fine watchman

He shuts his eyes feeling reassured Close on black

Open on extreme CU A hairy spider climbs up Eli’s neck It

reaches his neck It remains there for a beat as if to get
its bearings When Eli’s mouth opens it disappears inside

Close on black

39 EXT CARAVAN CAMP WARMMORRIS NIGHT 38A

A starry sky

Morris walks up to the horses Behind him a few dozen feet
away there’s another campfire with a few prospectors having
dinner

Morris opens Warm’s small bag and discovers some clothes
uninteresting artefacts a conversion table a slide rule a
chemistry handbook and a few notebooks with “This notebook
belongs to HK Warm” written on the cover

He opens of those pages filled with calculations and
formulas

He hears footsteps behind him and goes back near the fire

Warm comes up he’s holding some bowls and cups of coffee

39B EXT CARAVAN CAMP WARMMORRIS NIGHT

They are eating
MORRIS
I’ve only just noticed that’s the
only bag you have I guess you’re
gonna have to buy gear when you get
to San Francisco

WARM
I don’t need equipment

MORRIS
You’re going to look for gold ina
river without a shovel a pail a
cradle

WARM
This is the great challenge all
prospectors face How do I get
what’s just beneath my feet
There’s only two solutions of
course hard labour and good luck
I’ve been working on a third
solution for many years One that
is simpler faster more certain
And I think today I found it

Morris stares in disbelief

WARM
You don’t believe me

MORRIS
No offence Warm frankly I’m
having a hard time

WARM
You know it’s funny people usually
don’t believe me and then when
they do they want to kill me

MORRIS
What is this idea

Morris looks at him Warm smiles
After a beat
WARM
Well I told you I’m a chemist It’s
the idea of a chemist it’s a

formula

MORRIS
“Abracadabra”

WARM
No a divining substance
MORRIS

solution for it By inventing a new
society A society

54 EXT CAMP WARMMORRIS 2 NIGHT
Warm and Morris each sit to one side of the fire

WARM
- where the relationships among
men is governed by respect and the
absence of profit Thus a society
without greed Do you agree
MORRIS
What’s it have to do with your
formula You’re looking for gold
too like everyone else

WARM
For me the gold is just a stepping-
stone John I’m serious To found a
new society One one that will
consecrate itself not to profit or
gold but its its spiritual
development its own subsistence
nothing more the education of its
children

MORRIS
And where do you intend to create
this society

WARM
Dallas northern Texas There are
already many people waiting there
More are on the way from Europe

Warm take a sip
Morris remains silent Troubled

A beat

WARM
Well I can see I’ve lost you
John

MORRIS
One evening you told me about your
father that you left him because
there was no place for you As for
me all I can say is that I left my
family out of hatred and that my
father was the person I despised
most in this world Idespised
everything about him I sincerely
thought I had been freed of all
that until tonight listening to
you what do I realize
That most of the things that I
thought I’d been doing these past
years freely the opinions that I
thought I had of my own volition
were in fact dictated by my hatred
towards that man

MORRIS

I’m 35 years old and my life is
like an empty cylinder

TITLE MAYFIELD CALIFORNIA

The brothers walk through Mayfield The town is just as drab
and muddy

On either side of Main Street families wander among tents
and wagons All the signs bear the name Mayfield Mayfield
Supplies Mayfield General Store Mayfield Gold

ELI
You think this man came here
because it’s called Mayfield or
they started calling that once he
got there

CHARLIE
Maybe it all belongs to him

ELI
They sure like that name

Charlie heads for the saloon Eli follows as best he can

57 INT SALOON MAYFIELD SUNSET

He starts to leave but Charlie grabs onto his sleeve

ask for news in this town

CHARLIE
And who are you

MAYFIELD

Eli starts to answer but Charlie beats him to it

CHARLIE
He ran out on a debt to our
employer The Commodore in
Oregon City

Charlie watches for an effect And the woman has tensed to
hear the Commodore’s name

CHARLIE
We are the Sisters brothers

And to his satisfaction Mayfield is duly unsettled Eli on
the other hand is put off by this braggadocio

MAYFIELD
Good to meet you men You planning
on staying long

Eli stares at his teeth chomping at his cigar Charlie turns
around and looks at the clientele A group of girls is coming
down a staircase His shoulders straighten up

Well be leaving first thing

Charlie drains his glass His eyes are glazed from booze

And besides I like to know if our
reputation has preceded us Unlike
you brother I’m proud of what I

said handing him the shawl

“is a little piece of me that’s
traveling with you”

WOMAN
This shawl is a little piece of
me

women women straddling men

ELI

Charlie finishes getting dressed as best he can while Eli
readies the horses as quick as he can

When a voice surprises them

HEAD TRAPPER
Getting ready to leave Mayfield

Eli stops dead
The four trappers are there

Eli looks at Charlie hung over his head burrowed in his
horse’s mane He turns to the trappers

ELI
Alright Let’s just calm down We
have money Just tell us what
Mayfield is paying you

HEAD TRAPPER
I don’t think you’re going to live
long enough to find that out

CHARLIE
It’s funny that there’s so many few
words to describe things here in
Mayfield

Charlie who was out of it till now slowly lets go of Nimble
and seems to wake up

CHARLIE
Mayfield’s whiskey and Mayfield’s
hotel Mayfield’s Fucking
Mayfield

ELI

CHARLIE
Mayfield’s racoon Mayfield’s
Horses

Eli is worried to see Charlie wobbling

ELI
Why don’t you just tell us how much
you want

CHARLIE
No Eli it’s not about money
it’s about reputation

(MORE )

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Being the guys that killed the
Sisters brothers

Eli sees that something has changed in his brother’s eyes He
feels reassured

HEAD TRAPPER
You shut up now

CHARLIE
Prestige

Charlie throws up

A beat The trappers look at him in disgust

And in a flash the brothers draw simultaneously Their
cylinders spin their barrels spit fire flames light up the
barn Three trappers go flying into the hay The fourth
runs out of the barn and

tries to escape

Charlie whistles to Eli who tosses him another gun without
even glancing at him

Charlie catches it and at the same time aims and fires

63 INT MAYFIELD’S OFFICE NIGHT

Mayfield speaks expressionlessly A rivulet of blood runs
down from her forehead and drips off the tip of her nose

MAYFIELD
Warm said he needed an investor
for some prospecting scheme I
couldn’t make heads or tails of his
story I thought he was a clown
but when I saw Morris I thought
if the Commodore’s interested it
might be worthwhile

CHARLIE
Did Morris leave a letter for us

MAYFIELD
No He was just traveling with
Warm

CHARLIE
Really And why did you want to
kill us

Mayfield hesitates Charlie raises the butt of his revolver

CHARLIE
I’ll repeat that then I’1ll strike

MAYFIELD
When I realized Warm had something
of value I sent some guys after
them to bring him back

ELI
So now there’s more men on Warm’s
tail

MAYFIELD
Yes

Charlie raises the butt of his revolver
CHARLIE
All right Mayfield you’re not
going to like what comes next
but it’s the price to pay when you
mess for messing with our buisness
Open your safe
Mayfield’s face freezes She slowly shakes her head

MAYFIELD
No Never

CUT TO

at the curious townspeople then up at Eli

CHARLIE
No not like that Don’t you have
anything more positive

Fifty yards off the trail on a hillside the brothers finish
digging a hole behind trees and rocks

ELI
Anyway now we know one thing for
sure We know Morris has joined the
enemy

CHARLIE
I never liked that gentleman but I
must say this is the icing on the
cake
ELI
Warm have that’s so interesting
The Commodore sends men after him
Mayfield sends men after him and
now Morris falls into him
What does he have

CHARLIE
He has a formula It’s a chemical
product Supposedly you pour it in
the river it lights up all the
gold and you just bend down to
pick it up

ELI
You don’t believe that stuff
Charlie come on We’ve seen our
fair share of hucksters with
miracle products

CHARLIE
Yes but the Commodore seemed to
believe in this one

ELI
Why didn’t you tell me about it
before

CHARLIE

I had orders not to

In the hole they put their treasures wrapped in
ELI
Anything else you’re hiding from

me
Charlie looks embarrassed

CHARLIE
The Commodore’s orders are clear-
cut before we kill Warm we are to
extract from him by whatever
violent means necessary the recipe
for his formula

ELI
In lay terms torture him

CHARLIE
More or less

oilskin

67 EXT LOOT FOREST DAY

energy”

CHARLIE

You feel it dummy

69 EXT CLIFF DAY

The path is climbing up through short vegetation

CHARLIE
You know what brother I don’t

far

ELI
You mean between us in our
conversation

CHARLIE
What are you talking about I meant
in a straight line You and I have
never gone so far in a straight
line

The brothers can hear a distant continuous rumbling All of
a sudden here is it wide and endless the ocean

They put their hands on their hats so they won’t fly and gaze
at the water It’s obvious they’ve never seen something like
it

70A EXT PACIFIC BEACH DAY
At times waves come crash on the horses’ hooves The

They ride up a street on horseback into the fray tents set
up in the lanes trappers chained slaves Chinese families
sleeping in the streets

TITLE SAN FRANCISCO

CHARLIE
(eyes glittering almost
moved)
Goddamn this place is Babylon

When they look up they can see three-floor brick houses with
brightly-lit windows

ELI
You know when we find Warm it
won’t be worth looking for a quiet
spot there isn’t one in this whole
place

CHARLIE
More importantly nobody will care
We can kill anyone we want here
Fuck everyone’s mind is focused on
something else

72 EXT STREET SAN FRANCISCO NIGHT
Elsewhere
They leave their saddles at a stable and continue on foot

their gear propped on their shoulders

light the lights of a “grand hotel” The Golden Pearl

They look inside through a window Like two kids in front of
a Christmas window display

73INT HOTEL GOLDEN PEARL NIGHT

A valet precedes them through an upstairs corridor with a
kerosene lamp He points to a door

VALET
That’s the water-closet in there

»- and then another door
VALET

water

«- and yet another door

VALET
And here is your room

He opens the door enters and begins to turn on the lamps
The room appears a red velvet bijou gold tassels braided
pompoms beds in rococo copper

They’ve never seen anything like it before

Red as a lobster and wrapped in a towel Eli has just stepped
out of a hot bath He looks curiously at the dangling chain
with a wood knob He hesitates pulls on it and to his
surprise a torrent of water gushes into the toilet bowl

ELI
Charlie come and look at this

He walks out

75A INT GOLDEN PEARL RESTAURANT NIGHT

A restaurant in the same style as the rooms European
overkill

The two brothers have no clue how to behave or what to do
with all the silverware set before them
75B INT GOLDEN PEARL RESTAURANT NIGHT

Eli and Charlie are eating and drinking Especially Charlie

CHARLIE
A bit of comfort in uncertain
times
Eli nods A Beat
ELI

You know I was thinking We could
just go back to Oregon City and say
we couldn’t find them

CHARLIE
And tell what to the Commodore

ELI
The truth Morris ran off with
Warm Destination unknown Can’t be
expected to find them without a
single clue to guide us And
(lower )

We don’t even know if Mayfield’s
men have already found them

CHARLIE
Ok what are you getting at
brother

Eli lowers his voice and starts in

ELI
Between what we made in Mayfield
what we have at home and the rest
we have enough to ditch the
Commodore for good

CHARLIE
And why would we do that

ELI
Didn’t you ever think of stopping

CHARLIE
And do what

ELI
I don’t know
(he hesitates)
We could open a store together

CHARLIE
What store

ELI
Look weve had a good long run
were still alive we’ve a bit of
our youth left It’s a chance to
get out

Charlie turns beet-red Alcohol mixed with pent-up anger

CHARLIE
A store A way out Fucking
nonsense What is this bullshit

He is about to knock over the table or slap Eli who stares at
him without backing down

CHARLIE
-Well we’ve established that you
want to quit so quit

Charlie finishes his glass and takes a deep breath He starts
eating again

After a beat

ELI
Meaning what That if I stop youd
continue

CHARLIE
Of course I’d continue I’d just
need a new partner Rex asked for
work in the past

ELI
Rex Rex is just a talking dog

CHARLIE
He is obedient like a dog I could
ask Sanchez

Eli is stunned
ELI
Sanchez You would really trust
Sanchez and that idiot Rex to
protect you

Charlie looks him eye to eye

CHARLIE
Because you protect me
Is that what you have to tell
yourself to stay “nice guy Eli”
But WE are the Sisters brothers
The Sisters brothers Eli you and
me

Charlie straightens up and starts searching his pockets for
money

CHARLIE
You’ve made your decision and it’s
fine by me It will be welcome news
to he Commodore also We’1ll finish
this job then part ways

He throws a few bills on the table Moved Eli pays no
attention and continues

ELI
Why do you say it like that We’ll
part ways

CHARLIE
How do you want me to say it If I
stay with the Commodore and you
open your store

ELI
So you’re saying we won’t see each
other any more

CHARLIE
Yes when I come into town
Whenever I need a shirt or some
underthings

Eli watches Charlie light a cigar and stand up as if nothing
were the matter

ELI
Do you need to speak to me so
rudely To choose those words To
keep the level of the conversation
so low Is it because you’re drunk

Charlie looks at his brother and slaps him

Instinctively Eli’s hand grips the butt of his revolver
Customers around them freeze and watch Charlie put on his hat
and leave the restaurant with the face and gait of a drunken
man

76 INT GOLDEN PEARL HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

Fully clothed Eli is lying on the bed in the dark gaudy
room He stares at the shadows from the street played out the
red velvet walls and the ceiling

Charlie’s bags and clothes are still sitting on his bed

Eli stands up and starts packing

77INT STABLE DAY
Eli is about to mount Tub when

CHARLIE (OFF)
Hey brother

He turns around Charlie is all rosy and dapper

CHARLIE
What are you doing here

Eli is speechless Charlie continues matter-of-factly

CHARLIE
I’ve got some great fucking news
brother I know where they are
What do you say to that

Eli look at him without answering

CHARLIE
Did you hear me

ELI
Yes

CHARLIE
You don’t even care What’s wrong
with you

ELI
Don’t you remember what happened
last night

CHARLIE
Yes And

ELI
Don’t you remember that you hit me

Charlie pretends to try to remember

ELI
Stop pretending and spare me the
« I don’t remember » routine
You hit me in public Charlie so as
sure as you’re looking at me right
now I’m leaving

Charlie grabs Tub’s bridle

CHARLIE
All right what do you want This
is about slapping each other isn’t
it I slap you you slap me back
and we’re even So go on hit me
Hit me I said

Before he can even give Eli his cheek he receives a stunning
that sends him flying backwards

CHARLIE
Jesus fucking Christ Are you out
of your goddamned mind I gave you
a slap and you whack me with a
fucking shovel

ELI
See You do remember

Charlie gets back up rubbing his cheek
CUT TO

Encampment Remains of a fire Under the covers Charlie is
already asleep Eli tries to make Tub drink He encourages
him speaking softly
ELI
Come on Tub Eat some grass Oh

He takes the red shawl from his saddlebags He carefully
folds it into a pillow breathes in its fragrance and goes to

Nearby Charlie straightens up the toe of a boot violently
knocks him flat

Black

A blurry vision Voices of men heard from afar

WARM (0S)
No No not like this

Warm joins Morris

MORRIS
Not like what

WARM
This is no way to kill people

MORRIS
We have to kill them Hermann We

ELI (0S)

anymore

WARM

Then what are you doing here
Warm and Morris turn around Eli in a daze has stood up

ELI
WeWe don’t work for him anymore

82 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT DAY

Charlie and Eli are handcuffed sitting together on the
ground Charlie has a nasty black and blue mark on his cheek
Contrary to the specifics of their current situation Charlie
seems strangely happy

CHARLIE

And it just came out
ELI

- Yes
CHARLIE

You’re a genius Eli a goddamn
genius How did that pop into your
head Just out of the blue

He nods evasively

Warm and Morris have set up camp on a wide strip of pebbles
in the middle of the river

Two tents some gear barrels oilskin tarpaulins protecting
their supplies The horses are tied up on the banks

They watch Warm and Morris gather the gear they need load up
the animals Charlie yells at them

CHARLIE
Hey Morris what you gonna do with
us Ask us to run and shoot us like
rabbits Dump us in the forest

Charlie sniggers Morris barely looks back

83 INT MORRIS’S TENT DAY

Morris is sitting at a small wood table studying a map Warm
walks into the tent Morris doesn’t turn around

WARM
What are we going to do about them

MORRIS
We leave them here They’1l end up
killing each other or getting eaten
alive I couldn’t care less
We take the horses and the mules
we extract what we can from the
river one last time and then we
leave here without ever coming
back

WARM
And abandon all our gear

MORRIS
Well travel light ride up to
Sacramento buy more gear and ride
up the river from there
Suddenly from further down the hill
MAN (OS)

Anyone there

84 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT DAY

MAN (0S)
Anyone there Can you hear me

Morris takes a few steps forward
MORRIS
Yes what do you want

Another silhouette appears in the background

MAN 2 (0S)

We’re working the river downstream
We’re running out of supplies
Youve got any for sale

Warm joins Morris

WARM
They don’t look like prospectors

MORRIS
They’re not prospectors

MAN (0S)
I didn’t hear your answer

MORRIS
(To the man)
Because I didn’t give one Don’t
you take one step closer
(to Warm)
We’re going to have to fight
Hermann Are your guns loaded

WARM
Yes I think so

The silhouettes are creeping closer

MORRIS
Well take it out goddammit
(to the man)
I told you not to move and I won’t
tell you again We have nothing to
sell Go back to where you came
from

The man comes towards them Morris shoots The others shoot
right back Flames ricocheting bullets Behind them the

brothers shield themselves as best they can
CHARLIE
Hey what the hell Do something
Don’t leave us here

A bullet ricochets near Warm who jumps away

MORRIS
Hermann Hermann

WARM
(reassuringly)
I’m okay I’m okay

ELI
Let us help you Warm

Another volley of bullets

CHARLIE
Give us the keys you fucking
idiots You don’t stand a fucking
chance come on

Warm and Morris look at each other They hesitate

85 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT DAY

The four men are hiding behind boulders The brothers check
the weapons that have been returned to them

CHARLIE
You think it’s Mayfield’s men

ELI
Sure looks like them

Charlie signals Warm and Morris to stop shooting He stands
up using his hands as a megaphone

CHARLIE
Hey guys before things sour we’ve
got some news for you Mayfield is
dead You’ll never get paid
Do you think this is really worth
it

A beat as if a discussion were going on over there Then
more gunfire Charlie makes his way to Warm and Morris both
busy shooting

CHARLIE
(To Morris and Warm)
As long as you can see us you
shoot at them like crazy We make
it to the other side and you can’t
see us anymore stop shooting Get
it

Agreement

The brothers come out of hiding and move along each to one
side of the river Warm and Morris fire When the brothers
vanish into the forest they stop shooting

Suddenly the sounds of long 45 caliber flames pierce the
day We hear screams then nothing

Eli reappears dragging his feet as if coming back from a
chore

Whena trapper arises from behind a thicket Morris cocks his
revolver and shoots in a hurry

The trapper collapses revealing Charlie his arm
outstretched his gun still smoking

The two men face each other Frozen And then slowly lower
their arms

A moment of unease

86 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT NIGHT

They sit around the fire in heavy silence They pass around a
jug of liquor Sizing one another up eyeing one other
Eli notices that John Morris is scratching his legs

Hermann Warm clears his throat then

WARM
If Morris agrees to it this is
what I suggest You two keep half
of what you pull from the river
with the remaining half going to
the Company

CHARLIE
The Company being you and Morris

WARM
Yes well no not exactly The
Company is our phalanstery project

CHARLIE
Phalan-what

MORRIS
Phalanstery

WARM
-A community we’re founding in
Texas

(MORE )
WARM (CONTD)
An ideal living space ruled by the
laws of true democracy and sharing

CHARLIE
Whatever you say

WARM

Does something bother you

CHARLIE
That’s your business

WARM
So we agree half of what you
extract

CHARLIE

Fine with me

ELI
Me too

His eyes turn to Morris

WARM
Excellent Morris

After a beat

MORRIS
Don’t ask my opinion I don’t agree
with what’s going on
here I’m still in of course but
I remain on my guard

CHARLIE
Why don’t you look at me when you
say that

Morris gets up

CHARLIE
Look at me you son of a bitch

WARM
Gentlemen

Morris turns to Charlie

MORRIS
I’m looking at you Charlie
Sisters Do you want me to tell
you what I see

WARM
That’s enough

Eli holds back Charlie

WARM
Please

The tension decrease

MORRIS
I’m going to sleep

WARM
Do your legs still hurt

MORRIS
I’m all right Goodnight Hermann

They watch him wander off towards one of the tents

CHARLIE
He going to have to change

Warm gives a resigned shrug of the shoulders

WARM
He doesn’t trust you and you can’t
blame him He’1l change We all
have to We don’t have any other
choice

His eyes are on them a clear gaze frank and disarmingly
innocent He scratches his legs nervously Under the bottom
of his pants the brothers make out red skin that is starting
to blister

WARM
It’s the Formula It is very
caustic in its purest form I
thought diluting it would make it
harmless but I was wrong Next
time we’ll have to grease our
skins beforehand

He gets up

CHARLIE
Have you already prospected

WARM
Two days ago

CHARLIE
Did it work

WARM
Better than I ever imagined

He walks away

87 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT DAY

Early morning Eli washes at the river A little further off
he sees Morris brushing his teeth He waves Morris barely
reacts

Off to one side Charlie sits on the river bank watches them
from afar

88 EXT MOUNTAIN FOREST RIVER BANK DAY

The horses men and loaded mules make their way along the
mountainside

Warm and Morris check the river’s flow

The brothers follow pulling the mules Charlie still wears
the trapper’s hat

Ahead of them Warm points to the river below
They come closer and discover a spot where the current slows

down and the river bed widens A landscape like before the
birth of the world

89 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT DAY

They cut the branches on a tree they just felled A mule
pulls a trunk into the middle of the
river

Bare-chested the men cut branches and carry rocks They
work up to their waists in water

The dam is starting to take shape Warm crosses the dammed
river to gauge its depth With a knife he scrapes the
boulders in certain spots He examines the samples with a
jewelers magnifying glass

Very tight shot striations in the rock shimmers of quartz
golden reflections

90 EXT RIVER BANK

The sun is beating down The men nap in the shade of the
trees

Just the sound of insects and the river

91 EXT ENCAMPMENT EVENING

A new camp has been set up below at the foot of one of the
riverbanks

Eli and Charlie finish setting up tents when they hear
hoofbeats They look back Warm and Morris arrive with a mule
straining under three barrels The brothers watch the convoy
pass by it is obviously the Formula

Eli sees his brother’s eyes light up

92 EXT RIVER BANK ENCAMPMENT NIGHT
All four sit around a fire to finish their supper

MORRIS
Who wants to stand guard tonight

CHARLIE
That’s our job isn’t it
93 EXT RIVER BANK NIGHT

Wearing his trappers hat Charlie sits up on a rock that
towers over the river

After a while he hears laughter down in the valley

He straightens up and sees the three others drinking and
laughing gathered around the fire

CHARLIE
What are you doing

MORRIS
We can’t sleep

CHARLIE
What’s the point of me being on
guard if you all don’t go to
sleep

WARM
Charlie why don’t you come down
and join us It’ll do you good

ELI

Come on Come on there’s no point
We’re not going to sleep

94 EXT RIVER BANK NEW ENCAMPMENT DAWN

The four of them have their feet in the water They guzzle
booze They rarely speaksmoking cigarettes and watching the
sunrise

95 EXT RIVER DAM DAY

Morris is swimming in the translucent river Charlie sits on
the riverbank mocking look on his face

CHARLIE
Do you really believe in that two-
bit ideal society nonsense

MORRIS
What do you want me to say

CHARLIE
I don’t know but I say that a guy
with a little bit of smarts
has to realize that it sounds like
solid gold bullshit

MORRIS
Why do you think I’m here
CHARLIE
Like us For the gold
MORRIS
Sure the gold but what do you do
with it
CHARLIE

Spend it obviously

MORRIS
You really think you’ll have time
to With all the corpses you’ve
left behind the Commodore your
famous drunkenness

(MORE )

MORRIS (CONTD)
And if your pockets are full to
boot something tells me you won’t
be living to a ripe old age

CHARLIE
And would your ideal society make a
difference

MORRIS
I can’t say for you but for me
yes

Charlie thinks

CHARLIE
Or else it’s a scam A trap for
suckers Is that it

Morris gestures that he has heard enough

CHARLIE
Let me tell you something John
Morris you are one goddamned
arrogant asshole

MORRIS
Let me tell you something Charlie
Sisters I couldn’t care less about
what you think that is to say
if you think
96 EXT CAMP DAY
Eli goes to check the horses They are all there except for

Tub A piece of old rope dangles where he had been attached
Eli whistles looks everywhere

97 EXT FOREST TUB HOLE DAY

He notices some blood on a bush

More a little further on Then hoof prints on the
groundHe reaches the edge of a landslide

At the bottom of the ravine Tub motionless on his back
hoofs up

Eli looks at him saddened

98A EXT RIVER BANK DAY

Eli is sitting on the riverbank looking at the reflection of
the sun in water at the jumping trout

WARM (0OS)
What are you doing here

Eli turns around to see Warm coming towards him

ELI
Nothing much

WARM
I’m heading up to the dam to see if
the water has settled

98B EXT RIVER BANK DAY

They are walking At the bend they see the dam where Morris
and Charlie are working and talking

WARM
See that

ELI
Yeah I get the impression Charlie
is changing

WARM
You mean he’s not going to try to
kill us anymore

ELI
It’s a little strange talking about
this with you isn’t it

WARM
It’s Better facing up to things
You know one day I asked
Morris how he ended up working for
a man like the Commodore He said
something along the lines of the
desire to break away from his
family to live an adventure
Honest enough How about you How
did you end up here

Eli smiles

WARM
Does my question bother you

ELI
No no it’s just a long story
Charlie was always violent
When he got into a fight it
usually would end badly And when
you kill a man you end up with his
father his brother or his friends
on your tail and you have to start
all over again One thing leads to
another and I had to help him He’s
my brother

They walk in silence At one point Eli makes a face He puts
his hand to his heart He is dizzy

WARM
You all right

Eli shakes his head His hand looks for something to lean
against Warm helps him

WARM
Must be the heat We’ll sit here a
moment and it will pass

ELI
I’m sorry I lost my horse He
died I mean Tub is
dead He was a middling horse
but I didn’t think it to affect
me like this

ELI
When we were kids Charlie killed
our father

A beat
ELI
I’m the older one I should have
done it
WARM

Do you regret that

ELI
Yes‘cause after that Charlie
was never the same

99 EXT RIVER CAMP DAY

Morning Charlie sits on a rock bare-chested Eli is cutting
his hair

CHARLIE
That was a very pleasant day don’t
you think

CHARLIE
You get on well with Warm

ELI
And you with Morris

CHARLIE
What did you talk about

ELI
About us about the Commodore
About Pa He’s an easy man to talk
to

ELI
Tell me what do you think the
Commodore will do when
he sees we’re not coming back

A beat

CHARLIE
He’1l send men after us We’1l have
to get rid of them
And the ones after and all the
others he sends on our trail

ELI
And then

CHARLIE
And then sooner or later to put
an end to it we’ll have to kill
the Commodore

Eli does a double take He considers the possibility
ELI
Imagine we manage to kill the
Commodore What next

Charlie doesn’t answer Eli hesitates then

ELI
You take his place

CHARLIE
ELI
Are you taking the Commodore’s
place
Charlie looks at him
ELI
How long have you been thinking

about it
Charlie smiles giving a small mysterious shrug of the
shoulders
100A EXT RIVER DAM NIGHT

They cover their legs with grease they pour the solution
into smaller buckets

Warm and Morris exchange a look of hope
Warm looks straight to the lens The smile on his face is

hard to read an ambiguous mixture of worry and excitement

100B EXT RIVER DAM NIGHT

In the moonlight the dammed up water looks like a black
mirror

Charlie and Eli are on the riverbank next to one of the open
barrels Morris is standing on the top of the beavers’ dam
with a long branch Warm also with a branch is standing on
the other side of the river

WARM
Once you’ve emptied the solution
Morris and I will agitate the water
to increase the field of
illumination Now once the formula
starts to activate grab your
buckets and get to work
Not a moment to lose

Charlie and Eli lift the barrel and enter the water They
pour out the dense viscous formula The odor disgusts them

Warm and Morris hurry to stir the water with their branches
dispersing the solution

Charlie and Eli retreat to the riverbank coughing

They whack their branches on the water even harder until
Warm motions them to stop

The brothers wait on the bank Still nothing

CHARLIE
What’s going on Warm

WARM
Just wait

The four men stare at the black water waiting
Suddenly a glow then another then the river lights up
The four men rush in with their buckets Warm and Morris

under the dam Charlie and Eli on the other side

Innumerable tiny gold nuggets now dots of light as clear as
stars in the sky

The four men work the river as fast as they can All we can
hear is the clanking of the nuggets falling into the buckets

The leafy trees look like a vault of gold overhead
Eli stops a moment to watch the three men working Their
faces are lit by the river They all smile A breeze plays

with their hair Eli smiles too and goes back to work

Then the glow dies down as quickly as it appeared Slowly
the leafy vault darkens

Eli heads back to the bank crying and coughing He sees
Charlie banging away at the cover of another barrel

ELI
What are you doing

CHARLIE
Well dump it all in

Warm sees him from the other bank

WARM
Leave off Eli stop him

Charlie lifts the barrel He takes a few steps He loses his
balance and falls Thick liquid pours out of the barrel and
trickles onto his right hand immediately attacking his skin

The loose barrel rolls down to the river where the formula
spreads in viscous filaments

Blisters appear on Charlie’s forearm They swell and pop like
a toad’s throat He holds back a shriek of pain

ELI
Charlie

Behind him the river shines again in the barrel’s wake
Morris and Warm run across the dam Morris trips Eli sees
him fall into the water and disappear He holds his breath
Morris’s face resurfaces He screams

Eli sees Warm put down his bucket and immediately darts up

ELI
No Hermann no

But Warm jumps in and disappears like Morris

101A EXT RIVER DAM NIGHT

The water is black Warm resurfaces holding up Morris They
cough spit gasp for breath They collapse onto the sand
101B EXT WARM’S CAMP DAWN

Day breaks slowly over a landscape that has lost its colors
Dead beavers and fish wash up onto the gravel

On the riverbank Morris is dying

A groan more painful than the others makes him turn his head
Morris is looking at him His face is horribly burnt his
lips quiver as if trying to speak

Charlie knows what he is begging for He stands up and finds
a belt with weapons He grabs one as best he can with his
left-hand fingers that still work

He tosses the revolver to Morris and then kicks it closer to

his hand

102A INT WARM AND MORRIS’S TENT DAY

Eli goes inside Warm’s tent

Face ravaged by blisters Milky eyes bulging out Heavy
breathing

ELI
Hermann Can I do something for
you

WARM

Morris Is that you

Eli starts to clarify but

ELI
Yes it’s me

WARM
Oh John Where did you disappear
to

ELI

I was getting some firewood

WARM
John I feel I have known you a
long time I’m sorry you died
before me I wanted to help you I
wanted to be your friend

ELI
You are my friend Hermann

Warm retches His last sigh sounds like paper crumpling
As Eli inches closer to Warm a gunshot rings out Eli stands

straight

102B EXT WARM AND MORRIS’S TENT DAY

Eli comes out of the tent Charlie looks at him

By his side Morris dead holding the revolver against his

chest

103 EXT WARM AND MORRIS’S TENT DAY

Eli packs their bags to leave He brings the results of the
night’s collection a bucket two-thirds full of nuggets

He manages to fit their treasure into Warm and Morris’
horse’s saddlebags

Charlie is too weak and ill He stays under the covers

104 INT MORRIS’ TENT DAY
Eli gathers Morris things

On a crate by the bed he discovers a hardback notebook with
a title on its cover Adventure diary

The pages are blackened with cramped regular writing Eli
feels a presence behind him He leaves the tent

ELI (0S)
I must confess that the very
happiest moments of my life have
been spent in the wilderness of the
far west with the plentiful supply
of dry pine logs on the fire I
would not I would sit cross
legged enjoying the genial warmth
and watch the blue smoke as it
curled upwards

105A EXT MOUNTAINS CALIFORNIA DAY

The brothers walk down the river

Charlie is still asleep on the operating table

Eli looks at the stump in the bucket

108B INT DOCTOR CRANE’S PRACTICEOPERATING ROOM DAY

A fly lands on Charlie’s mouth Eli chases it away wipes

Then father and little girl enter the room Doctor Crane
looks worried

CRANE

ELI

CRANE
In the street Three of them

Eli lifts the curtain and looks across the street There is a

silhouette in front of the saloon general store

The guy is not trying to hide He nods swaggering He looks

like a killer

Eli cautiously opens the door a chink

ELI
Rex shit

REX
Eli

ELI
Yes

REX

Is it true that Charlie is out of
the game

ELI
What do you want

REX
Me Nothing The Commodore sent me
It’s been a while since you left
and he’s growing impatient

Eli peers into the street and sees two other silhouettes
behind him When he looks back he sees Charlie on the table

ELI
(to the doctor)
Is there a back door

CRANE
Yes

ELI
Go go go go go Charlie
Charlie get up We have to go
Eli is about to lift Charlie to carry him Charlie opens his
eyes and uses his good arm to grasp Eli’s collar Eli does
not understand

Charlie hangs on Stares into his eyes without letting up
His stare is tantamount to an order

He shakes his head in an irrevocable “no”
Eli puts him back down Charlie’s eyes remain glued to him

REX (0OS)
Do I have to come in and get you

ELI
No I’m coming out

REX
First you toss your guns then come
out with your hands up
Eli goes to look for Charlie’s Colts He slips them into the
back of his pants and undoes his belt

Two men lie sprawled across the street One of them screams
in pain Eli steps over and shoots him in the head

The third man crawls to take shelter Rex Eli walks toward

Before Rex answers Eli fires

112 EXT FOREST MAYFIELD DAY

The brothers gallop on Rex’s horses new boots and spurs on
their feet

113 EXT FOREST MAYFIELD DAY

They try to find their buried treasure But the mountain has

shifted and the spot is unrecognizable

Charlie finally finds the fork in the tree and tries to line
up with it All he can see are the disheveled fir trees like
a box of matches spilled on a table

ELI
Come on let’s go

Charlie looks around Distraught

114 EXT ROCKY LANDSCAPE EVENING

The sound of a cavalcade approaching A group of horsemen
gallops by

Hidden by the rocks Eli watches them ride by When he can no
longer hear them he comes out of his hiding place pulling
his horse by his tether

Charlie leans over the horse’s neck to grab the reins with
his good hand

He puts the reins in his left hand spurs the horse and
passes in front Eli follows him

115 EXT LANDSCAPE GUNFIGHT NIGHT

Darkness

Flashes of light and muted gunfire in the distance We move
in slowly

CUT TO

Sheltered behind the trunks of felled trees Eli shoots into
the shadows The shadows shoot back

Crouched next to him Charlie reloads guns as best he can
with a bad hand

ELI
The horses Get the horses to
safety

Charlie makes the horses lie down and lies down alongside
them

Charlie’s face against the horse’s side
He closes his eyes For the first time he is afraid

FADE TO

116A EXT PRAIRIE DAY

A wide flat landscape On one end the two brothers gallop
followed on the other end by four men who start shooting at
them In the distance gunshots and smoke

FADE TO

116B EXT PRAIRIE DAY

Two men lie on the ground dead One of them has his foot
still caught in his horse’s stirrup Charlie searches their
bodies grabs their weapons and ammo and hands them to Eli
who’s still on his horse

FADE TO

116C EXT PRAIRIE DAY
Galloping again The horses’ immaculate white coat

FADE TO

117 EXT ROCKY LANDSCAPE NIGHT

They have built a fire

Charlie cries Eli changes his brothers bandage wrapped up
around bloody stump

woe soe

As he stands guard and finishes eating Eli discreetly
watches him

CHARLIE
Rex and Sanchez and those other
guys we didn’t even know You
really think it’s a good idea to go
back up north

ELI
Well you know very well why were
going north And you know what we
still have left to do

CHARLIE
I lost the hand that I work with
You’1l be on your own on this

Charlie lets go of the powder flask Eli wants to help
immediately but stays where he is Charlie has seen that and
keeps trying

Eli can’t look at his brother struggling with the gun

CHARLIE
Are you ashamed of me

Charlie’s eyes well with tears

ELI
Do you mean what your saying

CHARLIE
Everything has fucking changed so
much

ELI
No nothing has changed You’re my
little brother and I love you

Eli empties his pan in the fire It sizzles and smokes
ELI
In a week well be in Oregon City
and I’11 kill the Commodore
woe ue
Charlie is lying asleep near the embers Eli stands guard
He hears his brothers sobs getting lost in the stillness of
the night
118 EXT LANDSCAPE DAY
The sun is beating down
The two brothers are riding slowly At one point Eli stops
around empty landscape as the eye can see
ELI

Hey have you noticed how long it’s
been since anyone’s tried to kill

us
CHARLIE

I don’t know three four days
ELI

Don’t you find that strange

Charlie turns around now He also finds it strange

119 INT EXT BARN OREGON CITY DAY
Final rehearsal Charlie repeats one last time

CHARLIE
You walk in the front door Take
the staircase on the right go up
make a left the office is on the
second door on the left

ELI
How many guys are up there with him
usually

CHARLIE
Usually there’s a guy sitting right
outside the office And one in the
room further down

They load their guns

120 EXT COMMODORE’S MANSION OREGON CITY- DAY

With his remaining hand still damaged Charlie slips a gun
in his belt

The brothers enter the town which is strangely deserted
They walk up the street In the distance a black cloth has
been striated around the large door of the Commodore’s

mansion

People scurry about underneath as if waiting for something

121 INT COMMODORE’S MANSION OREGON CITY- DAY

The Sisters brothers are standing side by side in a wood-
paneled parlor

Eli takes off his hat Charlie follows suit

Behind them townsfolk dressed in black sitting on two rows
of benches

In front of them an open coffin Inside the Commodore’s
corpse lying on ice

An undertaker is standing nearby waiting to hammer the lid
on

CHARLIE
(softly)
Fuck You must be disappointed

A beat

ELI
Yeah kinda

MAN
Sir I think no one else may be
coming May we close the casket

ELI
Sure

They put on their hats and start to leave

ELI
Hold on

Eli turns around steps back to the coffin gun in hand and
brings it slamming down on the dead man’s face

An unpleasant cracking sound Ice cubes bounce on the wood
floor

General astonishment Eli raises his hand to calm everyone
down

ELI
Just making sure

Then they leave

122 EXT OREGON CITY DAY
They gallop out of town and up to the plain
The evening falls

Their conversation continues indistinct in the distance

123 EXT SISTERS FARM DAY

The sun is about to rise At a bend in the road a modest
farm appears barn stables farmyard fenced in vegetable
patch

As Eli and Charlie head up the slope a woman appears in the
doorway

MOTHER
Hey if you come any closer I’1l
shoot you

ELI
It’s us Ma’

CHARLIE
It’s your sons it’s Charlie and
Eli

MOTHER
My sons Oh my god well why why
did you come why did you come
back

ELI

MOTHER

away from something you just turn
around I don’t wanna see ya

ELI
No we’re tired Ma’ We just want to
come home

CHARLIE
We just came here to see you I
swear
ELI
Please
124 INT SISTERS FARM BEDROOM DAY

Eli watches his mother’s old hand stroking Charlie’s face
They speak but he does not hear what they are saying

He walks around the house his eyes lingering on the walls
he finds the a measuring rod marked with names and numbers
Charlie a date a height Eli a date a height

He pushes open the door to their bedroom Their beds are
there one on each side of the room

Behind him he hears the voices of Charlie and their mother
Eli sits down pulls off his boots lies down on the bed
soothed by their voices

He stares at the piece of cloth over the window gently
billowing in the breeze Lulled by its back and forth his
eyelids grow heavy His feet are twenty inches too long for
the bed

On the floor through the curtains’ sway the breaking light
of day

THE END
