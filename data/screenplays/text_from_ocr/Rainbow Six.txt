Putrid brown haze chokes an endless horizon of black concrete
Pigeons glide across distort into smeared fragments as they
pass dehind the heat waves of a--

Monstrous airliner Just one in a long line of bloated
widebodies inching along - their wings of aluminum drooping
with fuel canks filled to the caps

A chorus of turbines WHINE as the parade creeps another foot
closer to flight

Over this a VOICE - whispering a phrase in the mother language
of Islam

INT AMERICAN AIRLINES 777 - COACH --

Close on the LIPS of a man repeating the phrase

Passengers in coach take note Curious Worried looks

NANCY a slender flight attendant scans down a seat
assignment sheet - comes to a blank line Turns to her
PARTNER in the galley

3 NANCY
He‘s a last minute filler

Now even more concern as they watch the man

PARTNER
Maybe hes praying

NANCY
Yeah but for what

Nancy takes the initiative grabs a plastic wrapped headset -
walks up the aisle hesitates behind the seat leans down

NANCY
Excuse me sir Six

JOHN CLARK lifts his HEADPHONES from his ears Experienced
eyes scan the flight attendant lock on her nametag

JOHN
Yes Nancy

Nancy hears a tinny voice from the earphones repeating the

same Hindi phrase in English --

we

° TINNY VOICE
“I am very honored to meet you” Now
repeat

She sees tne instructionai cassette spinning in his Walkman
realizes her mistake John helps her out

JOHN
The Saudis want fast food Guess who
gets to explain Jack in the Box to
them

Nancy seems flustered reveals the headset

NANCY

needing a headset for the movie

John sees right through her smiles

JOHN
And what is the movie today

NANCY
That action one with the guy that
used to be on that TV show

JOHN
Oh that one

NANCY
It’s supposed to be very exciting

JOHN

John’s seat neighbor CHARLIE - speaks up
CHARLIE

e hands a five dollar bill across the seat and John sees
iash- “CHARLIE GILROY” written in ink on the bill

sec and two dollars pass back into Charlie’s hand

the flight don’ hesitate to ask

She smiles again walks off Charlie leans to watch her

CHARLIE - 7

JOHN

Charlie looks at him curiously -- how did he know his name

JOHN “

You autograph alf your presidents and
CHARLIE

Oh that Just a way to amuse myself

between airports I send them out
and see if any return to the nest

John glances towards BUSINESS CLASS ahead

JOHN

And

CHARLIE
Not yet But the average bill passes
through four thousand hands before
wearing out

JOHN
Really Well you‘ll get one back
someday

CHARLIE

I don’t know This is my last trip
out Won’t get many more chances
- JOEN
Kind of young to be retiring

CHARLIE
Vist Gidn’t want to see that brown
slick anymore

That pulls John’s attention from business class Brown slick

CHARLIE
T work for an oil company help find
new places to drill - been doing it
proudly for 38 years Then one day
i‘m in one of these seven miles up
and three hours from any land - I
look out and see this brown slick and
I suddenly realized I helped create
that Then every time I saw it after
that it got worse I just can’t
look at it anymore —

Plane comes to an abrupt stop rocks as turbines WHINE down
Every passenger leans to the windows Charlie peers out --

CHARLIE
What the hell is that

John leans over to look Through the heat waves he sees an
army of rippling metal objects Growing in size

John is suddenly very tense looks to business class and now
we see the large MAN in the aisle seat

EXT TARMAC

is a blur as we race toward the horizon of idle widebodies
Sliding in around us are --

Two SUVs - three unmarked sedans - a stair truck and a hummer
with a Swat team hanging off the side

Match speed with the lead sedan - rifle in on the TEAM LEADER -
ALISTAIR STANLEY - walkie to his mouth - commands lost in the
din of the chase

A quick pan locates the American Airlines 777 - right near the
front Only one plane between it and 3 miles of asphalt

The FOOT stops tapping John stays locked on it - his hands
busy below - busy assembling an epoxy composite HAND GUN

Johns body tenses to one rigid mass as FOREHEAD stands -
glances toward a man with a heavy MOUSTACHE who quickly pushes
toward the CURTAINED OFF First Class section Forehead
reaches up to the overhead bin-

John rises - gun against his side -- and walks -- straight-
line toward business class as Forehead reaches into a bag in
the overhead bin John’s almost there when --

PASSENGER
He’s got a gun

All eyes converge on John Forehead glances across the aisle
to a man with a GOATEE A second accomplice

John raises his gun but a LINEBACKER-sized passenger
intercepts - grabs John’s am

LINEBACKER
Not on my flight asshole

Passengers urge him on as re tries to wrestle John down

JOHN
I’m CIA dammit

LINEBACKER
Youre MIA now buddy --

Goatee rises behind Linebacker - flash of a weapon -- John
acts quick flips the 300 pound do-gooder to the floor in one

incredibly swift move -- raises his gun over him and fires --

SCREAMS ring out as Goatee’s skull is aerated - decorating
passengers in rows 53 through 58 with red dots

Total panic and now --

JET TURBINES WHINE UP TO FULL THRUST and the plane JERKS into
motion Everyone grabs on

JOHN
(under his breath)
Oh great--

Forehead makes his break toward FIRST CLASS John climbs over
the linebacker snatches a LAPTOP from a man’s tray - throws
it like a Frisbee - smacking Forehead in the back He
stumbles to the floor reaches into his bag in desperation -

John rushes him -- fires into his shoulder --

Force propels Forehead’s hand from the bag a hand holding a
DETONATOR BUTTON John makes a mad dash to stop him but

But John is far from relaxed Stay on his face as the shadows
of the closing bay door darken his features more and more —-

LINSON (VO)
Yeah he’s a hero today but there’s
no telling what John Clark is capable
of Sometimes he goes way overboard
Like with this guy --

John is merely a silhouette at this point

LINSON (VO)
Blood vessels in the pupils exploded
Capillaries across the skin ruptured
Liver kidneys heart and brain
collapsed under intense pressure
All indications were that his victim
was rapidly decompressed his body
literally ripped apart at the seams

terrorists were not from the middle
east

in one section as he speaks in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN

All nod in agreement to the plan All except a PRETTY BOY

AS soon as Pretty Boy’s hand touches the briefcase Popov whips
around - snags him by the face and JAMS the heel of his wrist
into his larynx Pretty Boy drops to his knees gagging

Popov raises his shoe over Pretty Boy’s neck -

Mr Brightling it’s not everyday
CEO‘s of pharmaceutical companies -
make house calls Do you mind
explaining why youre here

BRIGHTLING
Because I’m not getting any younger
and judging from the grey your
stylist missed - neither are you

The Reporter unconsciously touches his greying sideburns

NEWS REPORTER
So this has to do with your company’s
genetic work on aging

BRIGHTLING -
There’s a ten year oldchiid in here
with Progeria a disease thats aged
his body eight times faster than
normal But because of some obscure
procedure or diet or maybe just a
plain good old fashioned miracle -
his regression appears to have
stopped What‘’s amazing is that this
hospital didnt even have a research
department One of the pediatric
doctors decided to take matters into
her own hands and start one just to
help one child Now that’s worth a
house call

Brenda nudges SANDY in the background

NEWS REPORTER
So it’s your hope that Thomas Bryan
will help in your research

BRIGHTLING
It’s my hope that we can help each
other If we can locate the gene
that controls aging we may be able to
shut it down Imagine what that
would mean to Thomas Imagine what
it would mean to us all No more
Grecian Formula Now if youll
excuse me--

Brightling pushes through is greeted by the outstretched hand
of Brenda --

It‘s ‘Mrs’
BRIGHTLING

Of course The bright ones are
always married

Sandy is skeptical of the compliment

BRIGHTLING
Your reports look very interesting

SANDY
You actually looked at them

BRIGHTLING
I was especially intrigued with the
progenic cell count on Thomas’ last
spinal fluid sample It increased by
20 units from the previous month Do
you have a hypothesis as to why

Sandy is taken a back by him Not what she expected

SANDY
Not yet

BRIGHTLING
Who do you have working on this now

SANDY
Two gene researchers a cell analyst
and myself

BRIGHTLING
Just four Amazing It must be a
talented group

Oh they are Mr Brightling

Sandy reacts impressed py his frankness

SANDY
I’d have to know you a little more to
make that judgement

BRIGHTLING
Great - so maybe I should actually
meet the child before you write me
off as a shark

Sandy is finally disarmed by him Cracks a thin grin

SANDY
Fair enough

firing at side by side targets 100 yards away

in Neber’s target are mostly on the next two circles out -

The targets are strapped to a very expensive unmanned DRONE

It flies swiftly to the left - to the right --

better aim A wayward bgllet hits the drone machinery ( x
Sparks tly and the drone¥goes out of control ms

Reciever’s gone -- Ive lost it

Ding jams the joystick with no response The drone is free-
flying erratically - and is now coming right for the men

Jacobs looks away from his gun sight - spots this half ton
contraption coming right at him

JACOBS
Shit --

Jacobs gets up and runs to the concrete wall near the others
But Weber stays in position - keeps firing -- taking out
chunks of the drone as it closes in --

STANLEY
Weber - get out of there

WEBER
(pushing himself on)
-- come on -- come to Poppa - show me

some lovin’ -

The drone is almost on him but he continues firing - hits the

fuel supply at the last second --

deadliest agent Healso had a bit
of a career in the private sector
where he specialized in designer
chemicals As in poisoning his
targets instead of shooting them He
wouldn‘t come out of retirement
unless it was for a really big job -
meaning a lot of body bags Which
brings me to Rainbow Six’s first

Receptionist doesn’t even get to move John squeezes his
finger and buliets rip from the box - riddle the Receptionist
and blow him back against the wall

A nidden Uzi hics the floor wefure the fake Receptionist does
INTERCUT WITH

threat is real--

WEBER
Well it’s official the Boss mans
gut is bankable

DING
Get us around back

Truck accelerates away
RESUME LOBRY

John starts toward the labs pauses when he spots a SCALE
MODEL of the UPI facility under Plexiglass

He shoves the top off UPROOTS the SOUTH WING section -- balsa
and plastic flying He moves into the facility using the
south wing model as a 4D map

EXT UPI - BACK AREA OF UPI

Fed Ex truck pulls up behind a retaining wall near the back

entrance The remaining team members pile out - get their
gear aimed on the back exit doors

All are crouched low together

WEBER
Never a good bet when the coach
plays

DING

Cap it Weber The Major knows what
he’s doing

WEBER
Then why arent you smiling

Ding ignores him - gets his MP-10 aimed safety off Lisanne

And how you gonna do that

She points toward a PHONE BOX near the back exit doors

LISANNE

Major said to stay out here he
didn’t say we had to be dumb and

WEBER
You mean blind

LISANNE
Same difference

She’s waiting for Ding to break protocol Finally --

Must be something seeing a woman like
that running around without her
burlap tent on

MO

It’s called a Burkah
(a beat)
And yes it is something

Mo actually smiles Weber is surprised
INT UPI
John makes his way through the corridors still using the

uprooted south wing model as his guide He’s suspicious of
the empty hallways No resistance at all

EXT“ UPI - BACK ENTRANCE

Lisanne’s COMPUTER SCREEN is a garbled mess - finally locks in
on an image An empty corridor from a high angle

The team crowds around is amazed

DING
It’s a view from a security camera

Lisanne punches keys and the images change from camera to
camera Homer moves up closer and the HEAVY BEAT of Led
Zeppelin is hard to ignore Imagine how loud it is to Homer

GUNMEN suddenly appear on the computer screen

WEBER
Jackpot a s

Ding leans closer watches the pixelated terrorists walk by

underneath He squints as Popov moves past
DING

It’s him - it’s Popov Shit Where

is this The camera Where is --

LISANNE
I’m working orf it

Lisanne punches more buttons and image switches to the 3D
blueprint - a blinking cursor left behind from the last camera
position Graphic zooms out showing more and more of the

facility until all see that --

WEBER
The terrorists are in the north wing
DING
I though the anthrax was in the
south
WEBER

Techie chick here must have gotten
her cards mixed up

LISANNE

Bullshit The anthrax is in the
south wing - these guys are not

Another camera view shows the terrorists entering a lab
environment - passing the research stations completely

Ding watches it nervously has to make a decisio

Major -- John

a7 UPI - SOUTH WING
John is at a stop - staring straight ahead

DING (OVER JOHNS RADIO)
I believe youre in the wrong wing

Pull out to reveal the doors to the HAZARDOUS RESEARCH AREA
Locked and sealed John is pisses at himself

JOHN
Move Ding --

INT UPI - SOUTH WING
Popov Model and the terrorists sh into the expansive

GENERATOR ROOM Slick floors ished concrete walls And
at the center isa Cwenty foot ish curbine generator

MODEL
They could power an entire
neighborhood in Prague with this

POPOV
Were not here to admire it - just
rig it and set the timers

Stacks and stacks of C4 bricks are removed from backpacks
slapped onto the walls - the beams - the generator itself

INT UPI - VARIOUS

Ding moves his crew quickly toward the south wing from the
rear entrance while --

-- JOHN is doing double time coming the Opposite way - gun
against his chest pride in his throat

JOHN
Why aren‘’t you after the anthrax
Popov - why

INT GENERATOR ROOM
A quick scan shows RED BLINKING LIGHTS everywhere C4 bricks

are affixed to every structural element including the loudly
HUMMING two story generator

POPOV
Thats enough -- let’s go

Popov Model and the crew gather their gear - head back out
ine way they came Model checks the detonator box

They mave out of the generator room into the connecting
corridor and here comes DING and his crew--

The two teams spot each other and bullets fly

Two terrorists are picked off quick slump to the floor
Model is hit in the leg spun around where Dominique catches
him drags him backwards

Popov glares at him --

POPOV
Next time when I say back out - back
out

All retreat back into the Generator room - firing as they go
INT ANOTHER CORRIDOR

John overhears the gunfire sprints toward the sound

INT GENERATOR ROOM

Model’s men quickly siaf primer cord on a large set of thick
steel doors on the opposite end - get set to blow it when a
FLASH BOMB rolls in from the corridor --

Popov covers up as a BRILLIANT FLASH blinds Models men -
causes one to connect the primer cord detonator wires and
BOOOM - door blows at point blank range - sends a stecl door
and a blinded terrorist clear across the room

Smoke fills the room and Ding’s crew enter guns blazing --

Dominique returns fire - backs toward the now opened doorway
until BULLETS RIP INTO HER

Model screams and rushes to her but is hit in his other leg
and goes down for the count

Popov backs into a corner spots the detonator box now lying
on the floor Out of reach He puts the machinery between he
and Ding‘s men - fires at the open area holding them at bay

JOHN steps in from the new entrance way - makes eye contact
with Ding on the opposite side

DING (INTO THROAT MIC)
He’s at your two o’clock John -- see
him

John moves around a post - spots Popov who seems to sense his
presence - spins and --

-7John and Popov lock on each other

DING’S view of Popov is blocked by the dividing structures

DING (INTO THROAT MIC)
I don’t have a shot --take him

John raises his weapon - aim is crue Popov raises his gun
over his head - surrendering

DING (INTO THROAT MIC)
Take him out John

But John pauses -- with Popov in his sights

JOHN INTO HIS THROAT MIC)
Why didn’t he go for the anthrax

DING (INTO THROAT MIC)
Who cares - take him out

JOHN (INTO THROAT MIC)
No

John lowers his aim from Popov’s HEAD to his LEG - from KILL
to WOUND -- but Popov gets the bead on him -- quickly fires
ahead at the GENERATOR

Before John can react the C4 brick EXPLODES -- ripping the
end bearing of the generator away in a fragmented EXPLOSION

Bodies hit the deck as shrapnel radiates like wild fire -
peppers the room with hot fragments --

METAL WAILS and the GENERATOR vibrates madly - shaking the
foundation under everything Feed pipes rupture -- STEAM
BLASTS -- covers blow -- expose the huge TURBINE ROTOR

spinning at five thousand RPMs ---

Popov stays low as the AXLE SNAPS and the whole damn thing is
set free ---

Asixteen foot roaring disc of titanium -— Spinning wildly
skating across the floor like a gonzo saw blade

Homer times it perfectly and dives out of the way but the
final terrorist guesses wrong and it slices him completely in
half --

‘Sev 1

Disc continues RAMS full force into the wall behind Popov --
shredding through concrete and drywall - severing power cables

- creating a massive fireworks display of sparks before
Dliunging the room into stroboscopic emergency lighting

By the time John finally gets a clear look into the disaster
zone -

-- Popov is gone

DING
Goddamit John - why didn’t you kill
him
JOHN
Because the answer would die with
him
- ‘
DING
And what’s the question
JOHN
Who hired him NOT to take the

anthrax

Ding is pissed beyond understanding

atti

DING
We didn’t need Popov for that - weve
got this fucker

Ding grabs the collar of a still breathing MODEL Ding glares
at John until John breaks free walks off

Ding shakes his head - jerks Model to his feet
Lisanne touches her ear piece as a transmission comes in

LISANNE
Well it’s official We just got
clearance from the Swiss to go in

That gets a look

GENERAL MOORE
They may have hit the wrong wing by
accident

LINSON
Right -- Dmitriy Popov and Ersnt
Model both hitting the wrong target -
that would be a first

The General does not like being badgered by this civilian

PETER
But sir that’d be like passing up a
nuke for a match It doesn’t make
sense

wt

LINSON
No - what doesn’t make sense is why cA
Clark didn’t take out Popov when he
had the chance

GENERAL MOORE
Clark had his reasons - we have to
trust him

LINSON
Like he trusted his team He left
them outside - he was in the wrong
wing

GENERAL MOORE
They wouldnt have even been there-if
he hadn‘t put the pieces together

LINSON
Fine - put him-on intelligence ‘cause
he’s not a leader -

GENERAL MOORE
Neither was I the first time out

Linson stops General Moore --

LINSON
You‘ve had a great career General -
don‘t let a stray bullet ruin it

GENERAL MOORE
I didn’t get these stars from letting
some piss ass little punk tell me how
to do my job Im certainly not
starting today

Linson finally turns walks off - yells back

LINSON
What he did was irresponsible and you
know it
General Moore does know it Can‘ deny it

He stops at the doorway to his siiice - opens it

INT JOHN AND SANDYS HOUSE IN DC - NIGHT

Furniture is scarce Packing boxes are everywhere All are
marker labeled - kitchen - bathroom - etc

John and Sandy sit on the floor wine glasses between them
Sandy sifts through a junk drawer Screws gum string--

She discovers several SILVER NECKLACE CHARMS Baby shoes -
baby crib - baby rattle Sandy holds them wistfully

SANDY
My mother who’d actually think
wearing stuff like this would help

She looks up at John for a response but he’s lost in thought

JOHN
I let him get away

SANDY
(heard it before)
Not again

JOHN
I didn’t want to kill him

SANDY
Maybe you respect him too much

vasa

JOHN
Hell no But killing Popov isn’t the
answer He’s not acting alone fr
know it Someone‘s pulling his
strings —

SANDY
(matter of factly)
And if you cut them now youll never
find Gepetto - yeah I got it

John is silenced by her bluntness

SANDY
Your instincts have always been
right John You can’t start second
guessing them now or you’re useless --

She grabs his hands

SANDY
To everyone Understand

Sandy gets up and John opens his calloused scarred hands
finds the delicate BABY CHARMS ‘The definition of contrast

John watches her dump the rest of the junk drawer in the
crash

JOHN
Maybe I should try and stay for this
banquet help you with Brightling

SANDY
(sarcastic)
Oh yeah thats a good idea

JOHN
Sandy I need you over there

SANDY
And you’1l have me over there as soon

I didn’t want a team I thought I
could do this on my own

Iwas wrong It won‘t happen again

Fucking up or admitting it

That gets a laugh breaks the tension Crew has just gainéda
lot of respect for their leader

Theres a reason that Popov hit this
place There has to be an ultimate
goal

INT MOTEL 6 ROOM DAY
DERRICK - balding obese He’s on his haunches

DERRICK
The trick to killing as many as you
can is to quietly infect just a few
Then let them go back to their homes
where they infect their families and
their friends and before you know it -
BAM -- you’ve wiped out the whole lot
of them

Derrick’s grin is as twisted as the tale The husky HENRIKSEN
leans in --

HENRIKSEN
Look I dont care how you do it
just get rid of them I hate those
fucking roaches

DERRICK
Dont we all but it’s Florida they
pretty much run this place

The exterminator pulls nis insecticide nozzle from the bathtub
rain stands

DERRICK
That should do it

Henriksen walks Derrick from the bathroom into the living room
where--

-- Popov is standing waiting

derrick pauses at the door Henriksen understands pulls out
several BILLS hands them over

DERRICK
Enjoy your stay

Derrick leaves Popov brushes dust from a very worn chair

POPOV
I’m not sure about this next job

HENRIKSEN
You just lived through a very
harrowing experience doubts about
your ability are to be expected

POPOV
I have no doubts about my ability -

HENRIKSEN
Better than you Dmitriy

POPOV
Not yet

Henriksen jots a note on a pad ‘

HENRIKSEN

Then do what the great Popov has

always done - deal with it - and him
POPOV

That will take some thinking

Henriksen throws a yellow legal folder over Popov looks
inside at stacks of hunfireds

HENRIKSEN
Thatll clear you mind huh

Popov is not so much surprised as suspicious

POPOV
So why is this job so important

HENRIKSEN

(shrugs)

Hey Im a guy doing a job for a

Popov is unsettled by the line Henriksen glances at the pad
where he jotted down the name -JOHN CLARK

Ding walks with John and Stanley past a table covered with
advanced weaponry He points at each --

DING
A hand gun that fires armor piercing
shells with hardly any kick
goggles that can detect movement from
a football field away -- a cell
jammer that scrambles dhone signals a
full mile away

JOHN
So where’s the Aston Martin with the
underwater option

DING
(stopping)
No man - these aren‘t ours They’re
devices we took off the terrorists in
the past 6 months

John examines the high tech phone jammer with disdain He may
see the need for it but he clearly doesn’t want to rely on it

- STANLEY
This isn’t about men who live in
caves and carry box cutters anymore
These groups are well funded with
their hands on some of the most
sophisticated hardware out there

JOHN
And I’m sure we probably built most
of this shit right

STANLEY

Unfortunately But those are last

year’s models

Lisanne’s multicolor heat signature suddenly rises off the
floor Nothing seems to be supporting her John pulls off
the goggles

STANLEY

Lights pop on reveal Homer holding Lisanne off the ground
He’s wearing the skin tight lattice body suit

LISANNE oa
Okay down boy

Homer puts her down John studies the suit closer

DING
Stealth technology shields heat and
vital signs from any glasses

John notes the suit tightness leaves little to the imagination
- pinches Homer’s nipple

Ouch --

JOHN
Doesn‘t offer much protection

If they can’t see you who needs»
protection

And we wonder where our tax dollars
are going

sunken And the skin seems looser with more wrinkles She
is hit with pain again grabs her stomach

DR WOLFE
Sure Thanks

Kirk starts walking through the narrow corridor and as he does

we see ROOM AFTER ROOM through one way windows And in each

BRIGHTLING
Well we already had one of those - it

was called the ionosphere May it
rest in peace

Acrowd of 700 environmentalists laugh The lobbyists and

invited DC heavy hitters roll their eyes
BRIGHTLING
And it didn’t just protect one
country or one species - it protected
every living thing Equally And it
was cheap All we had to do was
respect it

Sandy and Brenda sit at a table near the front
sits in his wheelchair nods

BRIGHTLING
The Earth was an ingeniously designed
habitat It was well protected self
cleaning and came with its own built
in defense system -- Tornadoes
earthquakes floods volcanos All
guaranteed to humble any species who
got too cocky and threatened a
monopoly But then here we came and
were pretty damn ingenious
ourselves And with our big brains
we created early warning systems
better building materials cloud
seeding techniques - and we’re now
coming close to rendering mother
nature completely impotent

Environmentalists nod Skeptics don’t

BRIGHTLING
What that means is the Earth can no
longer protect itself from the one
thing that can truly kill it Us
And people if it dies - we die

Popov likes the idea Henriksen studies Popov --

HENRIKSEN
So Dmitriy as a KGB agent how did
it feel when you had to kill someone

Popov reacts slowly to such a blunt question

When the crime to country was great
enough there was no feeling

See - that’s why you‘re here Youre
not afraid to do what it takes to get
something done when it matters
(a beat)

HENRIKSEN (contd)
So what do you think about crimes
- against nature

POPOV
What do you mean

HENRIKSEN
Things that hurt the entire planet
Killing off whole living species
polluting the land and the sea What
about that

POPOV
It’s a barbaric act and should be
punished severely

Henriksen smiles behind him

POPOV ‘
But how do you identify the-
criminals Is it the industrialist
who gives the order and makes the
profit or the worker who takes his
wages and does what he is told

HENRIKSEN -
Well at the Nuremberg trials it was
determined that following orders is
not a defense

POPOV
(off the cuf£)
So then youd have to say that
everyone involved in polluting the
Planet woulda essentially be guilty

HENRIKSEN
Exactly

Popov steals a look What

RESUME BRIGHTLING AND SANDY

BRIGHTLING
Do you know what happens to
biological populations that devour
and over-populate their environments

SANDY
When it’s really severe - they die
Lack of oxygen lack of food

BRIGHTLING
It‘s called a “die back” Endangered
species die back to manageable
numbers in order to survive
(pause)
Its a variation of natural
selection

RESUME POPOV AND HENRIKSEN

HENRIKSEN
You see we either allow man to
continue killing the planet slowly -
which he is already doing - or take a
stand - rip the Band-aid off in one
quick pull

POPOV --
What does that mean

BRIGHTLING (V0O)
It means the virus of this planet
must be brought under control

RESUME BRIGHTLING AND SANDY

BRIGHTLING
then the rightful owners can
rebuild while a select few humans sit
back and watch in complete harmony
In the long run it actually saves
both - the planet and humanity

SANDY
The select few meaning you and --

She gestures the compound

BRIGHTLING
We can comfortably house 3000

SANDY
And the other 5 billion or so What
are they going to do

RESUME POPOV AND HENRIKSEN

HENRIKSEN
What they always do - grow old and
die

POPOV

Then this is an 80 year project

HENRIKSEN
a (laughing)
Try two months -
POPOV “
How
HENRIKSEN

Genetics Specifically the gene that
controls aging

RESUME BRIGHTLING AND SANDY

SANDY
I thought your goal was to extend

BRIGHTLING —
An impossible dream m afraid Too
many years of evolutisn to unravel

(still wistful)

But -- there are always by-products

You get up on one --

HENRIKSEN
Oh no I’m outta here in an hour
Got to finish a final job in

Popov has finally gotten the colt under control He seems to
be scanning the horizon for something Kirk rides alongside

KIRK
Gonna miss this for a while But
when the virus dies down theyll be a
lot more places to ride a horse
Imagine trottifg down 42nd in
Manhattan with no assholes around
And they say the buffalo might be
grazing in Central Park again

POPOV
Where is the nearest town from here

KIRK
Right over those hills Brightling
tried to buy the property but even he
can‘t afford an entire town

Popov locks his sights on the hills

KIRK
That’s where we got the tirst test
subjects

POPOV

Test subjects

They had to see how the virus
affected certain people - how to get
it into the body

KIRK (contd)
how contagious it could be You

know they infect one and that one
goes back home and infects others

POPOV
(remembering)
Like killing cockroaches

KIRK
Exactly

POPOV
So how do they get it into the body

KIRK
They were using some kind of mister
system in the lab I don’t really

understand all that I was just the
pimp -

He laughs Popov hates that laugh

KIRK
Got some nice ass while it lasted

Kirk turns and Popov simply grabs him by the neck - that same
grip lock he used on Pretty Boy

Kirk struggles to get free - goes for his six shooter but
it’s over in seconds

Kirk slumps and falls from the horse dead

One less cockroach

He looks toward those hills - spurs his horsé and rides off

to even the scale - give mother
nature a fighting chance again

sy

Sandy sees him look past her - spins and spots Dr Wolf and
Dr Archer stepping in from the opposite end door

BRIGHTLING
There’s still a chance for you Sandy-

Sandy is like a trapped tiger - smack in the middle of two
converging threats

BRIGHTLING
If you think you could be part of a
new society All you have to do is
see the light

SANDY
Fuck off

Brightling’s demeanor turns sour when the POWER PULSES -
several times -- Emergency lights flicker on then off

The Doctors exchange a worried look

Sandy takes the cue - grabs a medic table and SMASHES it
through one of the one way mirror windows

The Doctors rush her as Sandy pulls herself through the
opening Cutting herself in the process

She races to che opened hospital room door -- rushes out

EXT THE COMPOUND

Spots light are dark Patrolling Guards now don infrared
goggles scan the grounds

Something ripples across their field of view -- comes out of
nowhere - GUTS a Guard in one swift move It’s JOHN in the
stealth suit He pulls the knife out with no emotion

Ding appears behind him Like a supér hero tag team 5

INT THE COMPOUND

Sandy is running turns a corner and is grabbed by Brightling

BRIGHTLING
It‘s time to earn your keep

She struggles as he Grays her out toward a back exit
A SECOND JET CARGO PLANE

accelerates down the runway as Brightling exits the compound
with Sandy in tow

A beat later and something RIPS past from above - hits the
runway and blows a TON of pavement skyward Cargo plane lifts
off just before plunging into the new crater

Seconds’ later several F-18s ROAR past -- dip in low rattle
the windows of the compound One goes after the plane that
just went airborne

Sandy smiles - but it only pisses Brightling off He jerks
her back toward the entrance and there’s JOHN standing in the
door - blocking the way

SANDY

John

Brightling pulls Sandy backwards across a concrete platform
using her as a shield --

Ding Homer Lisanne and Weber are now trained on Brightling

alt

Brightling backs onto the platform - the one right next to the
man made river that feeds the huge generator

He knows he‘s not going anywhere But he’s right on the edge

BRIGHTLING
Congratulations - you just condemned
mankind You look at yourselves as
heroes but you‘re really
executioners You took away the one
chance our species had to survive -
by saving the planet and living in
harmony with nature This Project
was our last hope

He edges closer to the drop off John is pained by his wound -
pull his gun behind his back

JOHN
Let her go Brightling

BRIGHTLING
Why She’s going to die anyway

That doesn’t sound promising

foun (5
We’re all gonna die sometime moe
BRIGHTLING
Unfortunately not quick enough
A cargo plane EXPLODES a mile away in the sky -- causes
Brightling to flinch
John makes his move -- whips out his gun - fires Bullet
slams into Brightling’s shoulder Brightling spins around -
letting go of Sandy but knocking her back -- she loses her

balance - goes over the side

JOHN
Sandy

John rushes to the edge - looks over and sees Sandy has
dropped into the rushing stream - is quickly being pulled
right toward the steaming VENTS of the generator

John turns - locks on that rifle in Homer’s hands - the one
with the vents --

He grabs it - runs breakneck and LEAPS into the RIVER --

WEBER
What the fuck --

UNDERWATER

John slams into view - immediately rights himself and points
the rifle the other way and HOLDS THE TRIGGER DOWN --

High velocity shells SPEwW from the nozzle - start PROPELLING
JOHN faster and faster Loward --

- Sandy - fighting helplessly against the torrential current

LISANNE
Oh my god

The team rushes down the platform barely able to keep pace
with John in the water -- 2

The VENTS are right there -- ready to swallow the life out of
Sandy -- ¢

JOHN is almost there and the CLIP RUNS OUT --

But his momentum keeps him going and he GRABS Sandy right at
the mouth of the generator Both are pulled in now and John
swings the machine gun sideways and it slams against the vent
edges - stops them from going in

The Rainbow team makes a chain - grabs the two and pulls them
onto the concrete facing

John hugs his wife hard looks back at his team Everyone of
them gets a nod from John Hes grateful and very proud of
his men

JOHN
Thanks

Rainbow Six is a single unit now

DING
So what do we do about him

Brightling is secure in the clutches of Homer Wounded but
very much alive

BRIGHTLING
You can’t do anything to me I’m
just a figurehead - I had no idea
what was going on After my very
well paid lawyers get done youll be
the ones that need defending

135 a

Vacate

JOHN
You know as sick as it sounds - he
May be right

DING
wWeli we can’t just let him go free

JOHN
Yes we can

Ding 1s confused until he sees that thin smile on John
EXT A DENSE UNRESTRAINED JUNGLE - DAY

Everything is alive here Crawling burrowing slithering
Mother nature at her best

Over the sounds of life comes’ a THUMPING louder then any bird
Trees and brush sway in the wake of an unseen wind--

THUMPING gets louder and a BLACK HAWK chopper fills the frame
as it lowers to the jungle floor

Rotors never slow as a door opens and someone is pushed out

CLOSE ON DOOR j

po

John and Ding stare out --

JOHN
You wanted to live in harmony with
nature

David Brightling has just been pushed outside - stark naked

JOHN
Now’s your chance

Ding gives him his patented grin Throttle is gunned and the
chopper starts to rise

Brightling stands there no protection - no supplies -
nothing He watches the only piece of civilization float
away The sounds of the JUNGLE fade in louder and louder as
the machine rises higher Life is everywhere and judging by’
the DEEP GROWLS Brightling is about to meet some of it He
spins and we lock on his PETRIFIED FACE

POV - FROM THE BLACK HAWK

We rise higher revealing more and more the endless jungle
that is already swallowing David Brightling

INT BRITISH AIRLINES 777 - Day

Rainbow team flying home commercially See Homer with
neadphones on Capping to a silent beat Weber and Mo sitting
together arguing whats kosher and halaal Two seats up
uisanne has her laptop open - Playing Miss Pac Man

Come to rest on John and Sandy John by the window Both are
naturally quiet after all they’ve been through

vohn reaches over rests a hand sn her lap When he moves it
aside he’s left one of those siiver BABY CHARMS on her flat
belly Sandy gives hima look

SANDY
Are you sure

‘
She takes his large hand in hers turns it and we see the
callouses the scars of a sorted Sistory

JOHN x
Well start as soon as “e get home

SANDY
Why wait

She gestures the VACANT restroom John chuckles

SANDY
It is kinda scary though bringing a
child into a world where Brightlings
exist

JOHN
Well that’s where we come in ma’am

She grins leans her head against his shoulder - feels safe
for the moment John stares out the window 7 miles up - 3
hours from any land --

SANDY
But John you can’t protect us from
everything

And he sees it - stretched out below like a smothering blanket
-- The BROWN SLICK

JOHN
You’re right not everything

FADE OUT
