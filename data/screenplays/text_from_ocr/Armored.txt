EXT DETROIT - NIGHT

Snow falls from a grey sky into the parking lot for

INT MR KIMS FOODS - NIGHT

Christmas decorations dress up the discount grocery store
like cheap makeup on an old whore Crappy Christmas music
plays on the cheap sound system as

TYLER TY HACKETT 27 stocks shelves with cans Hes good
looking even if a little rough around the edges He takes
life too seriously to enjoy it

A YOUNG FEMALE CUSTOMER 17 catches his eye She holds a
cranky INFANT as she nervously makes her way down the aisle

Tys MANAGER 40s comes into sight

MANAGER
Ty I need you to mop up tonight

TY
(I cant)
I have to pick Dana up after work

The Manager walks off to the cash registers

MANAGER
Then you better mop fast

Ty glares He notices the Female Customer lingering by the
medicine section

She glances around then slips a bottle of INFANTS COUGH
MEDICINE into her pocket

She goes to hurry down the aisle when Ty blocks her

TY
Excuse me

Her sunken face floods with fear Ty notes her coat is torn
Her sick baby coughs and cries Ty glances at the Manager

Christmas music fills the tense silence then
TY

(steps aside)
Merry Christmas
CUSTOMER
(emotional)
Thank you
She beelines out of the store

Ty watches her go A smile spreads across his face as

MUSIC KICKS Think a cover of RUN RUN RUDOLPH

EXT DOWNTOWN - LATER

Tys piece-of-shit 1979 Camaro blasts through traffic
passing magnificent glass and Art Deco towers

EXT SIMMONS AND CLARK JEWELERS - NIGHT

Ty wearing shabby clothes hurries past WELL DRESSED
SHOPPERS This part of town is a world away from the ghetto
where he works

Something in the jewelers window catches his eyes Ty stops
and looks longingly at a diamond ring in the window display

Its not the most expensive but it is the most beautiful

A SECURITY GUARD scowls at Ty from behind the window Ty
selfconsciously moves on

INT ANDIAMO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Upscale Busy

DANA 25 an attractive waitress smiles at FOUR LOUD
EXECUTIVES as they get up to leave They blatantly leer at
her body as they go

She collects the money they left on the table for the bill

DANA
Excuse me You forgot your change

EXECUTIVE
Thats your tip honey

She affects a friendly smile
DANA
Even though you didnt take your
eyes off my ass all night I
laughed at your stupid jokes and
smiled nicely And you left a
dollar and eighty seven cents

Dana hands him back his money
DANA
Thats not a tip honey its

change

Off the Stunned looks on the Executives faces

EXT ANDIAMO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Dana exits the restaurant The crushing weight of another
shitty day melts away when she sees Ty standing outside

They kiss Pure happiness

EXT CHRISTMAS TREE LOT - NIGHT
As Ty and Dana walk past a lot selling Christmas trees

DANA
(re Christmas Trees)
Look how beautiful they are

All Ty sees is the sign 150

TY
(frustrated)
One-fifty Who can afford that I
work two jobs and I sure cant

DANA
--We dont need a tree

TY
Then you gotta buy the lights

DANA
We dont need lights especially if
we dont have a tree

That gets a smile from Ty
DANA
Christmas isnt about money its
about family

A snowflake lands on her eyelash

TY
Theres a snowflake on your
eyelash

DANA

Make a wish and blow it off
Dana closes her eyes Ty is struck by how beautiful she is
Ty gently blows the flake off her lash
She looks deep into his eyes Their faces close Intimate

DANA
What did you wish for

TY
If I tell you it wont come true
EXT CORKTOWN - NIGHT
Shabby brick buildings and vacant lots spread like cancer

Here there are no decorations No Christmas No hope

INT TYS APARTMENT - NIGHT
DARK

Sounds of the city and arguing from other tenants bleeds
through the walls

Ty and Dana come in with CARTONS OF CHINESE TAKEOUT

Dana throws the light switch Nothing happens

Ty desperately tries another switch Nothing

DANA
Did you pay the electric bill

TY
I dont get paid until Friday Im
sorry baby
DANA
Its okay We can use candles It
will be romantic

They kiss The romantic moment is broken when

JIMMY HACKETT 17 strolls in with a basketball tucked under
his arm He helps himself to the food

Off their look

JIMMY
(mouth full of food
offering)
Egg roll

DANA
Ill get the candles

She goes Ty glowers as

Jimmy gulps down the last of the milk and leaves the empty
carton on the table

Ty takes the empty milk carton

TY
How many times do I have to tell
you to throw the empty carton out
dont leave it on the table

And tosses it in the garbage

JIMMY
Dont get pissed at me How was I
supposed to know you were getting
your mack on

TY
Youre supposed to be in your room
studying

JIMMY

I cant read in the dark
That cuts Ty

Dana lights the candles In the light she finds an ENVELOPE
on the table
DANA
(re envelope)
Theres a letter from the high
school

INT TYS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Ty clenches the school letter in his fist

TY

She gives him an incredulous look

TY
Okay Im mad Why arent you

DANA

TY

DANA

TY
He doesnt need to talk he needs

Ty nods

INT JIMMYS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jimmy reads by flashlight Ty opens the door holding the
basketball under his arm
TY
Come on

JIMMY

Ty tosses him the ball

EXT BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

Moving through the glow from street lights Jimmy drives to
the hoop Ty is all over him Shoving Pushing Jimmy
goes up and Ty smacks the ball away

As the game continues

JIMMY
Why are you making a big deal outta
this

TY

Because Im busting my ass so you
can stay in school

JIMMY
I thought I could get a job and
help out

TY

Your job is to finish school

JIMMY
I could do both

Jimmy steals the ball and takes a perfect three point shot

TY
So thats how it is

Jimmy smiles

Ty takes the ball He cuts back and forth trying to get
around Jimmy

TY
What do you do when your boss tells
you to work late

Ty pushes Jimmy shoves back The aggression escalates
TY
You cant say no you cant quit
because you need that job to pay
the rent
Tys frustration with his life boils He elbows Jimmy
TY
You dont have time for your school
work so your grades keep dropping
until you fail out Now you are
stuck working that crappy job with
no way out Youre trapped
Ty plows Jimmy over and slams the ball through the hoop

TY
--Is that what you want

Ty offers a hand to help Jimmy up
Jimmy knocks Tys hand aside and gets to his feet on his own

JIMMY
I didnt ask you to quit school

TY
Dad left Jimmy Someone had to
pay the bills
JIMMY
(angry)
Its not my fault

Jimmy leaves

TY
Thats not what I meant Jimmy

Jimmy doesnt look back

Ty immediately feels like shit for saying it

EXT CORKTOWN - MORNING

The neighborhood looks worse in the early morning light

INT TYS BEDROOM - DAY

Ty and Dana sleep He stirs and glances at the digital clock
beside his bed Its dead

EXT EAGLE SHIELD LOT - DAY
On the city outskirts
Tys Camaro blasts into a lot full of big red ARMORED
CURRENCY TRANSPORTS (ACTs) thats an Armored Truck for you
civilians

Crews of SECURITY GUARDS are already climbing into their
trucks and pulling out

As Ty parks COCHRANE 50s definitely ex-military calls
out

COCHRANE

punched you in

Ty races to the truck and climbs in

Tacky Christmas decorations add a hint of cheer MAPS on the
wall have marked routes DISPATCHERS monitor frequencies
used by police fire ambulance CB and the companys trucks
ASHCROFT 50s the Chief of Operations limps with a cane

On his hand is a ring bearing the crest of his old DETROIT
POLICE BADGE

He keenly watches the ACTs pull out

INT ACT 12 (MOVING) - DAY

Cochrane steers the truck out of the lot as Ty straps into
the passenger seat

In the rear jump-seat sits BAINES 30s who has the leathery
broken face of a boxer

TY
Thanks for waiting

COCHRANE
Company regs we cant leave
without a full crew

TY
Was the Chief upset

BAINES
The Chief is always upset

COCHRANE
Lucky for you this job could be
done by trained monkeys

TY
(finishing the joke)
--but theyd want more bananas

Ty and Cochrane share an easygoing smile

COCHRANE
Hows it feel

TY
What

COCHRANE
Its your last day of probation
Starting Monday youll officially
be one of us

BAINES
(re Cochrane and Ty)
Its like looking at a before and
after picture

Ty glances at Cochrane Troubled that this may be his fate
he forces a smile

Baines swigs from a flask and takes his morning nap

EXT DETROITS SOUTH SIDE - DAY

Snow falls as the ACT rolls past a forest of power line
towers and crumbling stacks in an industrial wasteland

Think a John Ford western with a stage coach winding its way
through the badlands

We get a glimpse of Spinning knobby BULLET PROOF TIRES
Thick BULLET PROOF PLEXI WINDOWS GUN PORTS everywhere

More than a bank vault on wheels Its a tank

INT ACT 12 (MOVING) - DAY

The cargo area has a REAR and SIDE DOOR with GUN PORTS under
the THICK PLEXI WINDOWS in each A ROOF HATCH FIRST AID
KIT FIRE EXTINGUISHER EMERGENCY ROADSIDE KIT Shelves

QUICK SHOTS OF TYS DAY

-- Ty and Cochrane carry MONEY BAGS into a BANK

-- HOLIDAY SHOPPERS buy Christmas trees

-- SHOPPERS withdraw CASH from ATMs

-- Ty and Cochrane haul more MONEY into another BANK

-- MONEY MONEY MONEY

INT ACT 12 (MOVING) - DAY

The ACT moves through a nice part of town Ty looks at well
dressed PEOPLE with a mixture of desperation and resentment

Cochrane glances at Baines They know how Ty feels

COCHRANE
It doesnt get any easier

TY
What

COCHRANE
Knowing you are risking your neck
for ten dollars an hour to protect
the money they use to buy new
clothes and fancy cars while you
cant even afford to keep your
lights on

Tys look says Cochrane is reading his mind

COCHRANE
Thinking about it only makes it
worse especially around the
holidays Youll get used to it
after a few years

TY
I wont be here that long This is
just to pay the bills until I find
something better
COCHRANE
Thats what I said twenty years
ago
Tys face sinks
A large GARBAGE TRUCK backs out of an alley blocking them

Cochrane anxiously blows the horn

TY
Whats wrong

COCHRANE
(worried)
Were boxed in

TY
Relax hell move soon

The GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVER gets out and heads to the back of
his truck

TY
Wheres he going

Suddenly a van with dark windows roars into view blasting
the wrong way through traffic Heading for the truck

Cochrane spots the van and pounds on the bulkhead

COCHRANE
Van on the left

Baines wakes and grabs a shotgun from the wall mount beside
the rear jump seat

Ty snaps around to see the van racing toward them

COCHRANE
Looks like a code ten

TY
(worried)
Do I call it in Should I radio
for help

As the van rolls alongside them
COCHRANE

I hope you got your life insurance
paid up Hackett

TY
Oh shit
Ty grabs his pistol
A tense beat then surprisingly -- the van zooms past them

Ty is stunned Sweat drips off his face
His eyes swim to Cochrane

Baines snickers A smile cracks across Cochranes face

INT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
A DOZEN GUARDS laugh as Baines tells the story

BAINES
(mocking Ty)
Do I call it in Should I radio
for help

He looked like he was gonna piss
his pants

They laugh Ty forces a smile
COCHRANE
The kid did okay I remember one
Probie who got out of the truck and
ran away

BAINES
I was going for help

Now Ty really smiles as the Guards enjoy a good laugh

Ashcroft walks in holding a large coffee can filled with
loose cash

ASHCROFT
Listen up

They stifle their laughter

ASHCROFT
I was getting the collections
together for Freddys widow and I
found this

Ashcroft pulls a note out of the can and reads it
ASHCROFT
For a good time call 555-6878

Baines smirks
Ashcroft moves through the room with a cold intense glare
ASHCROFT

Ashcroft hands Ty and official EAGLE SHIELD ID CARD
The Guards clap and holler

COCHRANE

INT BAR - NIGHT
A local dive Theyve had a few

Baines turns into a poet when hes
been drinking

They look at Ty who is in his own world staring at his
GUARD ID CARD - his future

TY
We all got money problems Thats
never gonna change
Ty downs his drink

The others look knowingly at Cochrane

COCHRANE
Never say never

Off Tys look

COCHRANE
There is a way we can change it

TY
How

COCHRANE
Steal the Christmas load

TY
(joking)
Yeah sure

Ty looks at Cochranes blank face

TY
Youre kidding right

Cochrane looks dead serious
TY

(to the others)
Tell me hes joking

Grim unflinching faces stare back at him
TY
(beat)
Okay you got me Ha ha Funny
joke on the new guy

COCHRANE
This is no joke

Ty reads Cochranes face
Ty is thunderstruck when he sees Cochrane is not joking

The mood radically shifts

TY
Youre serious Youre fucking
serious
COCHRANE
As cancer
Tys mind is reeling
TY

Holy shit

Ty looks like a deer caught in the headlights He looks like
hes going to be sick

COCHRANE
Listen to me kid We have a
perfect plan But we cant pull it
off without you

Tys eyes bore into him He doesnt know what to say

COCHRANE
Think about it On Monday we will
have TEN MILLION dollars in our
trucks

The number just hangs there Ty is incredulous
COCHRANE
Ten million split between the six

of us is a lot of zeroes

Ty cant help but think about how great his life would be if
he had that money

TY
Thats a lot of money

BAINES
Hell yeah

TY
Wait This is crazy

The others trade worried looks

COCHRANE
No one gets hurt Everyone wins

Ty looks to the others then back to Cochrane

COCHRANE
Monday at 0-seven-hundred we pick
up the load from the Federal
Reserve A shipment this big
requires two trucks Ours and

theirs
(nods toward Palmer Quinn
and Dobbs)

We take our regular route back to
the depot where the Chief will be
waiting to distribute the load to
other trucks for delivery But we
dont make it to the depot

TY
We dont

Baines stares through Ty

COCHRANE
Along the way we stop and hide the
money in a safe place Then we get
back on the route and call ina
code ten

TY
Thats it Hide the money and fake
being robbed

COCHRANE
The best plan is a simple plan

TY
They are gonna suspect you

COCHRANE
Of course they will The cops are
gonna come at us hard but if we
stick to the story they wont be
able to prove a damn thing

TY
I think theyll have proof when you
all quit and start living on easy
street

COCHRANE

Thats why we dont spend the
money My ex-wifes brother is a
banker Hell hide the money in
untraceable accounts that cant be
touched for two years The cops
and the insurance company will have
closed their investigations by
then

(beat)
Im due for retirement and you guys
will fail your next medical because
of post traumatic stress from the
robbery By the time we get the
money the company will have
forgotten we ever existed Ty
trust me No one gets hurt Its
a perfect plan

All eyes are on Ty whose mind is racing A beat then

COCHRANE
Are you in

TY
I dont want to steal some old
ladys life savings

BAINES
(seething)
I fucking knew it

Shit The guys are pissed Cochrane stays cool leans in

COCHRANE
(smooth )
Ty - Were not stealing anyones
life savings The money is
insured The insurance company
will replace it No one will lose
a dime

Tys eyes says hes on the fence considering it

COCHRANE
This is our only chance at this
The Company is in the process of
upgrading the trucks with GPS
tracking When that happens we
wont be able to take a piss
without the company knowing where
and how long it took Monday is
our last shot at a score big enough
to give our families a better life

TY
And if I say no

The Guards grumble Cochranes look silences them
COCHRANE
Then its off Its all of us or
it doesnt happen
Ty clocks the guys still on the fence
COCHRANE
You need this as much as we do
Take the weekend to think about it
(beat)
Well see you Monday Dont be
late

Cochrane drops some cash on the table as he goes The others
follow Cochrane out leaving Ty alone at the table

He has no idea what to do

INT JIMMYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the dim music buzzes from the headphones on Jimmys ears
as he reads the WANT ADS circling a few

Ty opens the door sees Jimmy reading so he turns on the
light Jimmys face says he doesnt want Tys light he
doesnt want anything from Ty

TY
I want to talk to you

Jimmy turns up the music and ignores Ty

Ty looks at Jimmy with regret and guilt

INT TYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ty lies in bed staring at the ceiling His mind races as
Dana drifts off to sleep beside him

TY
Did I ever tell you the last thing
my old man said to me before he
split
DANA
(groggy )
I dont remember
TY
He said life doesnt give you
chances you have to take your
own
Dana snuggles up to him
TY
You remember that wish I made the
other night with the snowflake I

They enter the long abandoned RUSSELL INDUSTRIAL CENTER

EXT RUSSELL INDUSTRIAL CENTER

The two ACTs roll past a rusty NO TRESPASSING sign and
enter a maze of decaying six story brick buildings

EXT AUTO-BODY FACTORY - DAY

CRASH A flying rock shatters glass Two young BOYS throw
rocks to break the few remaining windows in one of the
decaying six story brick buildings

The Boys hear an engine and take off running They disappear
into a dark narrow crevice just as

A TACTICAL MOBILE UNIT you know it as a police car crawls
around the corner of a building

INT TMU (MOVING) - DAY

ECKEHART 50s with choirboy eyes in a street wise face hums
Deck The Halls as he drives Beside him is LEON 30s

LEON
Do you have to do that

Eckehart with a devilish smile hums louder
LEON
This is a waste of time We should
be out busting real criminals not
looking for kids breaking windows
ECKEHART
We catch these kids when theyre
young set them on the right path
and they never become real
criminals
LEON
You missed your calling Eckehart
You should have been a Priest

power relay station

INT AUTO-BODY FACTORY - DAY

Wind moans Shadows blanket huge PRESSES and MACHINES They
stand like rusting tombstones and in a way they are

Quinn and Dobbs drag open a pair of large wooden doors

The trucks rumble in triggering an explosion of beating
wings as what seems like a thousand PIGEONS take flight

Dobbs and Quinn pull the doors shut behind them

Ty and Cochrane climb out Baines throws the back door open
and hops out with the SHOTGUN over his shoulder

Ty scans the cavernous ruins

TY
You sure the money will be safe
here

COCHRANE
Safer than a bank No one comes
here

Cochrane checks his watch
COCHRANE
We got fifty minutes to stash the
money and get setup Move it

Baines and Palmer pry up a heavy metal cover to a conduit
access tunnel

SNICK A blade snaps out from Cochranes knife
He slices off the red plastic security strips on a money box
They gather around as Cochrane lifts the cases lid
Theres more green than a St Patricks Day parade
They cant take their eyes off the money
Ty cant believe its real
Cochrane and the others beam
BAINES
A bunch of dead guys never looked
so good They even smell nice

Baines savors the smell

TY
Not bad

COCHRANE
Youre part of the biggest armored
car robbery in history and not
bad is all you can say

TY
Its god-damn amazing

COCHRANE
Thats more like it
(nods at ACT 12)
Give me a hand with these

Ty climbs in the back

Cochrane gives Baines a nod then climbs in after Ty

INT ACT 12
Ty grabs a money box Hes like a kid in a toy store

TY
I cant believe theres five
million dollars back here

COCHRANE

Remember stick to the story We
stopped because a broken down car
was blocking the road but it was
an ambush Three masked guys with
guns got the jump on us and jacked
the money

(beat)
One of us was shot

That surprises Ty
«Cochrane uses Tys momentary shock
-In one deft quick move
-He pulls Tys gun from his holster
Ty is suddenly uncertain about what is going on -- so are we

TY
You said no one would get hurt

COCHRANE
No one will believe we gave up ten

million dollars without a fight
(MORE )

COCHRANE (CONTD)
This way when the cops arrive
well be money gone and man down

TY
What do you mean

Cochrane hands Tys gun back to Baines
Ty pales as he realizes - they are going to kill him
TY
Cochrane you dont have to do

this

Cochrane slides a BERETTA out of his jacket This isnt his
service weapon its an extra he brought just for this

COCHRANE
Ten million splits five ways a lot
easier than it does six Its the
math its not personal

TY
It is to me

Ty looks to the others for help

Baines is stone cold Quinn cant meet his look and turns
away They wont help Ty Hes all alone

Tys desperate eyes scan the truck for an escape but
Cochrane is standing in front of the exit

Cochrane aims his gun
Ty cringes

BAINES
Wait

Ty gasps for air The Berettas muzzle is right in front of
his face Cochrane shoots Baines a questioning look

Through a broken window Baines sees the TMU come into view

We got trouble

The Guards snap to the window

Only Ty and Cochrane remain locked on each other

PALMER
Cops

Eckehart stops the car and scans the area From here its
impossible to penetrate the darkness inside the buildings
INT ACT 12
Their eyes are riveted on the idling TMU outside

COCHRANE

(to Ty)

Dont make a sound

Ty glances out the trucks window He sees the TMU his only
hope of surviving pass and move away

Sweat beads on Tys brow If he cries out Cochrane will
kill him If the cops leave hes a dead man

Its now or never Ty edges toward the door

COCHRANE
Dont move

TY
Shoot and the cops will hear

Cochrane lowers the gun
BAINES
(loud whisper)
Fuck that

COCHRANE
Hes right

-Cochrane slides out his SWITCHBLADE

Oh shit

Ty backs into a corner as Cochrane advances
Hes trapped

Cochrane is about to stab him when

TY
I wrote a letter

Cochrane stops
TY
It tells everything If I dont
check in with my brother in an
hour he takes it to the cops

COCHRANE
I think youre lying

TY
Do you really want to find out

Cochranes eyes bore into Ty
Tys mind races trying to betray nothing
Beat then

COCHRANE
Ill take my chances

Cochrane moves in

Tys hand flies out ripping the FIRE EXTINGUISHER off the
wall and SLAMMING it into Cochranes arm to deflect the
knife As Cochrane reacts Ty hammers it into his head

OUTSIDE ACT 12

Baines snaps to the commotion in the ACT He jerks his
shotgun up for action

INSIDE ACT 12

Ty sees Baines leveling a shotgun at him
Acting fast he boots Cochrane in the chest
Sending Cochrane flying out the back door and
OUTSIDE ACT 12

Cochrane flies in front of Baines blocking his aim so
Baines cant fire

Ty yanks the door shut with a heavy thud
Hes safe but not for long

Ty scrambles over the money boxes and through the truck

He used the slam locks
