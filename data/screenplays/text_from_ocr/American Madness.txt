made impressive by the shining finely

A group of young men paying tellers

to the main vault He is about twenty-six
a clean-looking personable youngster
Several of the tellers are standing

close to him looking on
MATT

TELLERS

Matt begins to work the combination
of the main lock

MATT
(with his back to them)

Say did you boys ever hear the story
of the pawnbroker with the glass eye

pawnbroker with the glass eye

is confronted by stone faces

MATT

Sympathy You know the right one had
more sympathy than the other one
1ST TELLER

Whats the matter Cant you get this
thing open

Matt stares in disbelief then gets
the joke

MATT
(contemptuously)
Six reasons why banks fail

This cracks them all up as a uniformed
officer who has been standing by works
a lever attached to the floor which
lowers a section of the floor directly
in front of the vault This permits

the vault door which is sunk below

the floor level to swing open

TELLERS
(ad-libbing)

I love your jokes Matt Theyre so
entertaining A very funny man

Matt opens the inside door made up

of perpendicular steel bars The tellers
scurry into the cavernous-looking interior

with steel cabinets divided into many
small compartments On one side is a
wall safe which is also opened by a
combination and which contains the surplus
cash carried by the bank Matt is in
charge of this All around the room

are numerous hand trucks - one for every

SHOTS of the general activity backstage

of the bank

Male and female clerks stand around

at various angles checking away at
adding machines Several are assisted
by someone who calls off figures to

them as they record it on machines

We hear these figures read in a monotone
as we pass them

Matt is still trying to pry the ten
dollars loose from Charlie

MATT

Now listen Charlie Ill give you an
IOU Ill give you a note Ill pay

Ad-lib conversations from the other
clerks distract his attention

MATT
Aw nerts

Charlie arrives at his cage CAMERA
STOPS with them

continues on to his cage muttering
half to himself

MATT

Im not asking you to pay off the Depression

Another teller is busy in the cage next
to him Matt addresses him referring
to Charlie

MATT

That mug reminds me of a guy with his
second dollar

made last month

addresses the directors further

CLARK

And as I told you at breakfast it is
time we did something about it

22 CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ

In thorough accord with Clarks violent
attitude is Schultz a German whose
instinctive conservatism rebels against
Dicksons liberal banking methods

SCHULTZ

Mr Clarks right Dickson will ruin
this bank if we dont stop him

23 MED SHOT

As another of the directors OBrien

a large bull-faced thunderous-voiced
contractor rises to Dicksons defense
(OBrien is always filing his nails
even while he talks)

OBRIEN

Personally I think youre getting panic-—

about nothing Dicksons all right

CLARK

(interrupting)

Oh is he We carry more unsecured paper
than any other institution in the city
Were fools to tolerate it

SCHULTZ

Thats what I say And the only way
to end it is to get Dickson out

24 CLOSE SHOT - OBRIEN

He looks toward Schultz

OBRIEN

Dont make me laugh Schultz

25 MED CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

CLARK

Dickson doesnt have to go But he must
agree to this merger with New York Trust—

What good will that do Why it will

take control away from him Well put
somebody else in charge call in all

doubtful loans and be on safe ground
again Thats what good it will do

to say about it

As the other men group around the loan
list which Clark has put back down

on the table They all scrutinize it
carefully

SCHULTZ

(to the men at large)

And on what Hunches he calls it

AMES

Some day hell get a hunch about a
man and give the bank away

CLARK

Hes almost done that already Our chief
teller Matt Brown is an example of
that He breaks into Dicksons house
holds him up and the next day gets

a job in the bank

stiff shirt and collar with stripes
running perpendicularly Flashy gray
suit - spats - and walking stick The

dressed to kill

Schultz who is seated near Dickson
looks up at him

SCHULTZ

You can make a handsome profit on your
stock

DICKSON

Im not interested in profits Im interested
in the bank In the depositors Theyre

my friends Theyre looking to me for
protection and Im not walking out

on them

Clark and OBrien also seated around
close to Dickson
CLARK

How are you protecting your depositors
By making a lot of idiotic loans
OBRIEN

Take it easy Clark

Ives seated next to Schultz becomes
alarmed

IVES

My dear friends

DICKSON

63 CLOSER SHOT

As Dickson retorts

DICKSON

Whats the matter with my policy How
many losses has this bank taken in the
last twenty-five years

(he looks around - silence)

Ill tell you Not a single one

(defiantly)
Whats wrong with that kind of banking

CLARK

(mumbles disdainfully)
Just pure luck

64 CLOSE SHOT

Ames seated beyond Ives now speaks
up

AMES
Conditions have changed These are precarious

times Banks today have got to be careful
And youve been more liberal than ever

Dicksons voice comes in over scene

DICKSONS VOICE

liberal

65 CLOSEUP - DICKSON

As he continues

125

DICKSON

The trouble with this country today

is theres too much hoarded cash Idle
money is no good to industry Where

is all the money today In the banks
vaults socks old tin cans buried

in the ground I tell you weve got
to get the money in circulation before
youll get this country back to prosperity
66 CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

CLARK

Who are we going to give it to Men
like Jones Last week you made him an
extra loan of fifty thousand dollars
Do you call that intelligent banking

67 CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ AND DICKSON

SCHULTZ

He cant pay his bills How do you expect
him to pay us

DICKSON

Thats a fair question Schultz Now

lets see how bad a risk Jones is Whats
his history Hes been a successful
business man for thirty-five years

Two years ago business started falling
off Today Jones needs money and if

he doesnt get it he goes into bankruptcy
and throws nine hundred men out of work
Answer - unemployment

68 CLOSEUP - OBRIEN

As he listens intently Dicksons voice
coming in

DICKSONS VOICE

It also means his creditors arent paid
Theyre in trouble They go to banks
and are turned down more bankruptcies

69 CLOSEUP - DICKSON
As he continues
DICKSON

Its a vicious circle my friends and
the only place to cure it is right here
at the source Help Jones and you help
the whole circle Now when Jones comes
to me I ask myself two questions First
- is he honest Yes Second - is he

as good a business man as he was before
And the answer is - hes better
70 CLOSEUP - CLARK

Showing his reaction as part of Dicksons
speech comes over scene

DICKSONS VOICE

He is not only older and wiser but

his present trouble has taught him
precaution

In my estimation gentlemen Jones is

no risk Neither are the thousands of

other Joneses throughout the country

DICKSON

Its they who built this nation up to

the richest in the world and its up

to the banks to give them a break Disraeli
said security is the prosperity of the
nation—4

AMES
(cutting him off)

Why Disraeli didnt say anything of
the kind
DICKSON

Well he should have said it Its as

true now as it was then And let us

get the right kind of security Not

stocks and bonds that zig-zag up and

down not collateral on paper but character

CLARK
(indignantly)

Character hmmpf Thats your idea

DICKSON

Not at all Thats Alexander Hamiltons
idea5 - the finest banking mind this
country has ever known Those are his
exact words gentlemen Character Its
the only thing you can bank on and
its the only thing that will pull this
country out of the doldrums
