CUT TO

CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958)
Lights twinkle Snow falls The WIND MOANS
After a beat the voice of an elderly black man

NARRATOR (VO)
Thes right New York

We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky From the
streets far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled
by the falling snow and the DISTANT sound of many
VOICES SINGING

We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings the tops of
skyscrapers slip by left and right

NARRATOR (VO)
Its 1958 -- anyway for a few mo
minutes it is Come midnight its
gonna be 1959 A whole ‘nother
feelin The New Year The
future

The SINGING a little MORE AUDIBLE but still not close
is Auld Lang Syne

NARRATOR (VO)
Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin
to start one mo trip ‘round the
sun an evvybody hopin this
ride round be a little mo giddy
a little mo gay

We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper At
its top is a large illuminated clock

NARRATOR (VO)
Yep

We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds

( )
1

NARRATOR (VO)
-- All over town champagne corks
is a-poppin

A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track

NARRATOR (VO)
-- Over in the Waldorf the big
shots is dancin to the strains of
Guy Lombardo Down in Times
Square the little folks is
a-watchin and a-waitin fo that
big ball to drop

The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a
distant CROWD Sixty Fifty-nine Fifty-eight

NARRATOR (VO)
» They all tryin to catch holt a
one moment of time

The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the
WIND Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper
we begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK The
clock reads a minute to twelve Above it in neon a
companys name HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES Below it in
neon the companys motto THE FUTURE IS NOW

NARRATOR (VO)
» to be able to say -- Right
now This is it I got it
Course by then itll be past
(more cheerfully)
But they all happy evvybody havin
a good time

We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next
to the clock The window starts to open

NARRATOR (VO)
-- Well almost evvybody Theys
a few lost souls floatin ‘round
out there

A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge
With the opening of the window AULD LANG SYNE filters
out with greater volume

NARRATOR (VO)
This ones Norville Barnes

( )

The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge He is
perhaps in his late twenties He wears a leather apron
Printed on the apron HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOMThe Future
is Now

He looks with nervous determination into the void

NARRATOR (VO)
Lets move in for a closer
look

The CAMERA obliges We TRACK IN SLOWLY ENDING VERY
CLOSE

NARRATOR (VO)
- That office he jes stepped out
of is the office of the president
of Hudsucker Industries Its his
office

Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK
grows louder and the WIND blows in his face

NARRATOR (VO)
-- Howd he get so high An why
is he feelin so low Is he really
gonna do it -- is Norville really
gonna jelly up the sidewalk

Norville is tensing his body peering out over the ledge
preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but

the CAMERAS continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME
We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK whose MECHANICAL
THRUM becomes very loud indeed

NARRATOR (VO)
Well the future thats something
you cant never tell about

The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve --
bare seconds to midnight Distant CHANTING from Times

Square MIXES UP Nine Eight Seven
NARRATOR (VO)
- But the past Thats another
story

OVER BLACK

The HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE
and GRINDING GEARS as we

FOLLOWING the bag as its owner carries it down the
street He pauses sets it down

YOUNG MAN

Fresh-faced eager -- NORVILLE BARNES He is gazing off
at

WESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

The sign is over a ground floor office an exterior clock
shows 900 A curtain is just being pulled open in its
picture window to reveal a great job board It is like
the departures board in a great train station with each
of its individual entries flipping over occasionally to
reveal a new opportunity On offer are jobs like PASTRY
CHEF STEAMFITTER LAY-OUT MAN GRAVEDIGGER etc

REVERSE

On the small crowd gathered to like Norville watch the
board -- men in search of jobs of various classes and
vocations but alike in their intent gaze their hands
dug into their pockets their hats pushed back on their
heads bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the
chattering board Men occasionally head for the office
as they see a prospect they like

Norville stands pat watching

HIS POV

An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

NORVILLE

He brightens

We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED

NORVILLE
He frowns

Around him the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to
apply for their respective jobs

We see other entries JUNIOR EXECUTIVE PAN TO EXPERIENCE

CLOSE SHOT - EXECUTIVE 4

A middle-aged mousy-looking man in a conservative

suit and wire-rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks
to someone 0S Behind the Executive we see only

the skyline of New York City

EXECUTIVE
-- So in the third quarter we saw
no signs of weakening Were up
18 percent over last years third
quarter gross and needless to say
thats a new record

TRACKING
DOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table Executives line
either side We are APPROACHING the man at the far end

of the table to whom the report is being directed

( )

He is late middle-aged dressed expensively but conserva-
tively his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive
who drones on

EXECUTIVE
The competition continues to
flag and we continue to take up
the slack Market share in most
divisions is increasing and weve
opened seven new regional offices

The TRACK has ENDED IN a CLOSEUP of the man at the end
of the table who still smiles benignantly at the
droning Executive The smile is serene almost other-
wordly This is WARING HUDSUCKER

REPORTING EXECUTIVE
He drones on

EXECUTIVE
Our international division
has also shown vigorous upward
movement in the past six months
and were looking at some exciting
things in RandD

The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OFF the droning Executive as the
big mans attention apparently wanders we FRAME UP ON
the picture window skyline of New York

WIDER

Norville sitting at a coffeeshop counter sets the pen-
cil down His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm
His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head He idly
stirs his coffee with his spoon

( )

He takes one last gulp of the coffee then sets the cup
down on the want ads stands and digs into his pocket
for change turning it inside-out

CLOSE ON COUNTER

As Norville puts all his change on the counter His
hand hesitates he takes a little of it back He
LEAVES FRAME

A waotresss hand ENTERS from the far side of the
counter She clears away the saucer then the cup --
which has been resting on the want ads It leaves

a perfect brown circle around one entry

NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE

Again LOOKING THROUGH the WINDOW as OS the reporting
Executive drones on

EXECUTIVE (0S)
- Our owned-and-operateds are
performing far above expectations

Federal Tax Act of 1958 is giving
us a swell writeoff on our plant

WARING HUDSUCKER

looks dreamily out the window His attention returns to
the droning Executive and the benignant smile returns
to his lips

CUT TO
NORVILLES BACK 6

He walks dejectedly down the street hands shoved into
his pockets

A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME The wind tosses
it this way and that

Slap -- It plasters against another pedestrian who bats
it away

The newspaper eddies around some more then plasters
against Norville

He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops
noticing something

NEWSPAPER SCRAP

It is a section of the want ads One entry is perfectly
circled by a coffee stain

BACK TO NORVILLE

He looks up from the paper There is purpose in his gaze
Wind whips his hair

CLOSE SHOT - WARING HUDSUCKER 4

As the Executive drones on 0S Hudsucker is carefully
winding his wristwatch

EXECUTIVE (0S)
- Our nominees and assigns continue
to multiply and expand extending our
influence regionally nationally
and globally So third quarter
and year-to-date weve set a new
record for sales

Hudsucker looks up from his watch smiles runs his
palms back over his fringe of hair

EXECUTIVE (0S)
- new record in gross

Hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the
right amount under the suit

EXECUTIVE (0S)
» new record in pre-tax earnings

( )

Hudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully
sets it in his ashtray

EXECUTIVE (0S)
new record in after-tax profit

He deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at
its face

The sweep second hand is starting the last revolution
that will end at precisely noon

EXECUTIVE (0S)
and our stock has split twice
this year

Hudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table

EXECUTIVE (0S)
In short

Savoring a pause the Executive looks around the board
table

EXECUTIVE
were loaded

This draws an appreciative chuckle from the board It
is cut off by

HUDSUCKER
Ahem

The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker who sits in the
fg Beyond him is the length of the board table and the
large picture window He rises to his feet slowly and
deliberately and rubs his palms together
He swings his chair out
He steps up onto the chair
The board stares
He steps up from the chair onto the board table
The heads of the board members swing up in unison
Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN He shakes the
tension loose from each leg then waggles both arms
dangling at his sides like an athlete preparing for a
sprint

The hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP

as Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the bg towards

the office building across the street Its street number
tops its imposing entryway in large gilt letters 285

We continue TILTING UP the length of the skyscraper to
reveal a huge clock capping its facade Above the clock
is the identification HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES Below the
clock is the motto THE FUTURE IS NOW

The huge clocks sweep second hand is just approaching
the position that will make the time 1200 sharp

ANOTHER ANGLE 9

As the second hand hits the twelve the CLOCK TOLLS
the board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker
comes flying out

HUDSUCKER
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh

SECRETARIAL AREA 8

Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building A secretary sits
typing next to an open window finished pages sitting
stacked beside her As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK

HUDSUCKER
-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh

As Hudsucker shoots past the window his draft sends the
stack of papers wafting this way and that As the secre-
tary turns to look out the window FREEZE FRAME (wafting
papers have their motion arrested) and SUPER A TITLE

TRACKING 9
WITH Hudsucker the building slipping by behind him As
he yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of

hair The CLOCK TOLLS

FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE

HOT DOG VENDOR 10

on the street handing a steaming frank to a customer who

PASSERBY ON SIDEWALK

The man wearing a fedora is in the fg of an EXTREME

of the Hudsucker Building

The passerby reacts to the approaching yell looking up
just as Hudsucker ENTERS FRAME

FREEZE FRAME to suspend Hudsucker a good twenty feet
above the sidewalk arms and legs splayed comically
arrested The passerby is frozen in an attitude of
surprise and disbelief

SUPER the title of the film THE HUDSUCKER PROXY

to his rendezvous with the sidewalk BELOW FRAME

DUTCH ANGLE 10

The Hudsucker Building lists up into the distance A
woman in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises
INTO FRAME AT an OPPOSING SLANT Looking down at the
sidewalk she sends two dismayed hands to her cheek
and screeeeeeeeeams

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

EXT TOP FLOOR 11

With the LAST TOLL of the CLOCK punctuating the CUT we
are FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window
The womans SCREAM on the street below is FAINT ECHOING
MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN

THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still
sitting around the table paralyzed in attitudes of
horror and disbelief All stare at the shattered window
in the fg

At the far end of the table Hudsuckers chair is empty
and oddly askew His cigar still smokes in its ashtray
There are dust footprints down the middle of the long
oak table

( )

11

One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held half-
way to his mouth another holds a carafe suspended on its
way to his water glass another holds his spectacles
inches from his nose

We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK

SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window He is a tall
middle-aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and
a commanding presence

He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his
knuckle looks out grunts and draws his head back in

The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room The other board
members heads swivel to watch him all staring
searching desperately for some hint as to the fate of
their fallen leader Apparently some absurd hope still
lingers

Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair
He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the
suicides ashtray

MUSSBURGER
Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo

The other board members unfreeze their worst fears
confirmed

AN EXECUTIVE
He couldve opened the window

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
Waring Hudsucker never did anything
the easy way

ADDISON
My God why Why did he do it
Things were going so well

MUSSBURGER
What am I a headshrinker Maybe the
man was unhappy

ADDISON
He didnt look unhappy

EXECUTIVE
Yeah well he didnt look rich

( ) 11

ELDERY EXECUTIVE
Waring Hudsucker was never an easy
man to figure out

(reminiscing)

He built this company with his
bare hands Every step he took
was a step up Except of course
this last one

MUSSBURGER
Sure sure he was a swell guy
but when the president chairman
of the board and holder of
eighty-seven percent of the
companys stock drops forty-four
floors --

PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Forty-five --

ELDERY EXECUTIVE
Counting the mezzanine --

MUSSBURGER
-- Then the company has a problem
Stillson what exactly is the
disposition of Warings stock

STILLSON
Well as you know Hud left no
will and had no family The
company bylaws are quite clear
in that event His entire
portfolio will be converted to
common stock and will be sold
over the counter as of the first
of the fiscal year following his
demise

MUSSBURGER
Meaning

STILLSON
Meaning simply that Warings stock
and control of the company will
be available to the public on
January first

MUSSBURGER
You mean to tell me that any slob
in a smelly T-shirt will be able
to buy Hudsucker stock

Stillson shrugs

( ) 11
STILLSON
The company bylaws are quite
clear
ADDISON
My God Youre animals How can

you discuss his stock when the man
has just leapt forty-five floors --

PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Forty-four --

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
-- Not counting the mezzanine

MUSSBURGER
Quit showboating Addison the
man is gone The question now
is whether were going to let
John Q Public waltz in and buy
87 percent of our company

PIPE-SMOKING EXECUTIVE
Whatre you suggesting Sidney
Certainly we cant afford to buy
a controlling interest

MUSSBURGER
Not while the stock is this strong
How long before Huds paper hits
the market

STILLSON
January first

AN EXECUTIVE
Thirty days

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
Four weeks

ADDISON
A month at the most

MUSSBURGER
One month to make the blue-chip
investment of the century look
like a round-trip ticket on the
Titanic

AN EXECUTIVE
We play up the fact that Hud is
dead

( ) 11

ALL
(in unison)
Long live the Hud

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
We depress the stock --

YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
-- to the point where we can buy
fifty-percent

PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Fifty-one

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
Not counting the mezzanine

CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE
It could work

OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE
It should work

PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE
It would work

MUSSBURGER

(at ticker tape

machine)
Its working already Waring
Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison
Avenue All we need now is a new
president who will inspire real
panic in our stockholders

ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE
Yeah a puppet

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
A proxy

YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
A pawn

Mussburger strides across the room from the still

CHATTERING TICKER TAPE MACHINE and lowers himself into

cigar and

Waring Hudsuckers chair He takes a last puff from his

slowly exhales a cloud of smoke
MUSSBURGER

Sure sure Some jerk we can

Jumpin Jehosephat a blue letter

Mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept
out of the crowded aisle to form a clear path running
down to an elevator in the bg

With a SIREN SOUND a light above the elevator goes on
The elevator door sweeps open It reveals a wall into
which a four-foot high hinged door is set

This door swings open and an old dwarf emerges Old
man HUTCHINSON the boss of the mailroom He emerges
from the blinding light of the interior of the elevator
He is holding aloft a letter

He takes loping drawf strides down the aisle

CUT TO

ELEVATOR DOORS 16

ROCKETING OPEN We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator
who leers INTO CAMERA He wears a brass-buttoned uniform
white gloves and a pillbox hat The name BUZZ is stitched
onto his breast pocket

As Norville enters the elevators

BUZZ
Hiya buddy The name is Buzz
I got the fuzz

He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut then
lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto
his head

BUZZ
- I make the elevator do what
she duzz

( )

16

He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake
it he snaps it away and pats down his crewcut

BUZZ
- Hang it up to dry

He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR Norvilles
knees buckle under a huge upward surge Buzz is accustomed
to it

BUZZ

balance)

CUT TO

ELEVATOR DOORS 17
Sweeping open Norville staggers out
BUZZ
(hissing)
Good luck buddy
The door sweeps shut Norville looks nervously around
Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again
BUZZ

-- Youll need it
( )

17

The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES
SCREAM as it power-dives away

Norville turns toward the executive offices
Plush thick-carpeted silence
Norville starts walking

A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive
quiet Norville looks to one side

A workman in painters overalls squats in front of a pair
of heavy oak doors With a razor blade he is scraping
off the name WARING HUDSUCKER

NORVILLE
Mr Mussburgers office

The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville
With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction

Norville enters the adjacent office

OUTER OFFICE 18

Two secretaries are in Mussburgers outer reception
office The first is a filing secretary who stands
frozen in the fg her hand poised over an open drawer
to deposit a folder as she stares at Norville with an
amused and supercilious sneer which stays pasted on
throughout

The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated
behind a desk in the bg that flanks the door to
Mussburgers private office The Receptionist sits with
her hands clasped on the desk staring at Norville with
the hunch-shouldered down-from-under look of a patient
vulture

RECEPTIONIST
Do you have an appointment

NORVILLE
Uhh no I --

The filing secretary sneers
RECEPTIONIST
Shall we look in the book

hmmmmmmmmm

( )

18

She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed
crinkly pages

NORVILLE
No maam ya see I wouldnt be

RECEPTIONIST

We dont seem to be in the boooook
Norville is groping in his apron pocket

NORVILLE
No maam ya see I dont have an --

RECEPTIONIST
If we had an appointment wed be
in the booook

NORVILLE
I know but ya see I have this --
here it is this letter --

A low unearthly WAIL fills the room the sound of a
million souls moaning in purgatory

The Receptionist looks up

FAST TRACK IN ON SNEERING FILE SECRETARY

who is no longer sneering Her mouth is stretched wide
as she wails and her finger points

FAST TRACK IN ON BLUE LETTER

that Norville holds innocently at his side

BACK TO TRACK IN ON WAILING SECRETARY

As her wail becomes deafening and we TRACK INTO her mouth
and the SCREEN GOES BLACK and

CLICK 19
The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the
sound of a DOOR OPENING We are

INT MUSSBURGERS OFFICE

its door swinging open to admit Norville
( )

19

In the bg in the outer office we can see the filing
secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp
rag draped across her forehead The Receptionist is
fanning her with a towel

The door closes behind Norville

We hear a rhythmic CLICK-CLICK-CLICK and the HUM of
VENTILATION

NORVILLES POV

Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk behind
which is a large executive chair facing the window From
above the back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up A
telephone cord snakes around to the man sitting in the
chair hidden from us On the desktop is a perpetual-
motion machine of large swinging ball bearings Click-
click-click

A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in
the far corner of the office

A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the
Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES
by immediately outside the window describing an arc that
throws a moving shadow across the office

His BACK TO us into the phone

MUSSBURGER
-- Sure sure Parkinsons stupid
but hes ambitious too hard to
control

He swivels around to face Norville who stands
deferentially at the door Still listening at the phone
Mussburger waves Norville forward

MUSSBURGER
- No Not McClanahan sure he
bungled the Teleyard merger but
that means hes got something to
prove
He covers the mouth piece

MUSSBURGER
-- Who let you in

NORVILLE

( ) 19

Into the phone

MUSSBURGER
Atwater Tremendous Except I

The INTERCOM BUZZES fiercely

VOICE (VO)

Mussburger hits the intercom

MUSSBURGER

But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing
from the PHONE

MUSSBURGER

MUSSBURGER

phone)

Look chump either you find

(into the first
phone)
Ear-clay

Ood-gay
(slams down both
phones looks at
Norville)
This better be good Im in a bad
mood

Norville clears his throat

NORVILLE
Well sir Ive got something for
you from the mailroom but first
if I could just take a minute or
so from your very busy time

He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of
paper across the desk to Mussburger who stares frozen
at Norville making no move to take the paper

NORVILLE
to show you a uh

Norville undaunted holds up the paper since Mussburger
will not take it Mussburger doesnt even look at it
his eyes are locked on Norvilles Mussburger smolders

NORVILLE
a little something Ive been
working on for the last two or
three years

Mussburgers burning eyes finally shift momentarily to
look at the crudely drawn circle he looks back incredu-
lously at Norville

( ) 19
NORVILLE
You know for kids Which is
perfect for Hudsucker -- not that

I claim to be any great genius
like they say inspiration is

99 percent perspiration and in my
case Id say its at least twice
that but I gotta tell ya Mr
Mussburger sir this sweet baby --

MUSSBURGER
Wait a minute

Sudden quiet

With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings
abruptly stop

As Mussburgers eyes burn in on him Norville stands mute
and paralyzed

His eyes locked on Norvilles Mussburger circles the
desk He stands toe-to-toe with Norville

He thrusts his face into Norvilles whose head moves
reflexively back Mussburgers nose is almost touching
Norvilles his eyes are burning searching studying
evaluating

Finally he draws his head back

MUSSBURGER
Hmmm

With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norvilles gaping
mouth With his other hand he raises Norvilles chin so
that his teech clench it

MUSSBURGER
Umm—-hmm

He steps back eyes still on Norville

He jerks his thumb over his shoulder indicating his
chair behind the desk

MUSSBURGER
Siddown

Norville his lips puckered around the unaccustomed
ciger looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger

MUSSBURGER
Go ahead Try it on

( ) 19
Norville obeys reluctantly stiffly

MUSSBURGER
Put your feet up

Norville is again reluctant

MUSSBURGER
Go ahead

Norville obeys Mussburger studies

MUSSBURGER
Hmmmm Lets get to know one
another shall we

Norvilles eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing
from between his teeth Mussburger seems to relax

MUSSBURGER
Lets chat
(beams )
Man to man

Norville beams
MUSSBURGER
You werent blessed with

much

He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a
euphemism

MUSSBURGER
education were you

NORVILLE
Well Im a college graduate --

MUSSBURGER
All right but you didnt excel in
your studies

NORVILLE
Well I made the deans list

MUSSBURGER
(worried)
Hmmm

Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke

( ) 19

NORVILLE
At the Muncie College of Business
Administration

MUSSBURGER
(relieved)
Sure sure And did your classmates
there call you jerk or
(searches again)
- schmoe

Norville shakes his head

MUSSBURGER
Shnook Dope

Dipstick Lamebrain

NORVILLE
No sir

MUSSBURGER
Not even behind your back

NORVILLE
Sir They voted me most likely to
succeed

MUSSBURGER

(curtly)

Youre fired

NORVILLE
But sir --

MUSSBURGER

Get your feet off that desk
As he struggles to comply

NORVILLE
But --

MUSSBURGER
Get out of my sight

Norville squinting against the cigar smoke pulls the
cigar out of his mouth as he doubles forward feet still
up groping for a place to set down the cigar He sets
it blindly on a loose stack of papers

MUSSBURGER
My God The Bumstead contracts

( ) 19

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

The top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from
the cigars live end

MUSSBURGER
You nitwit I worked for three
years on this deal

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler

MUSSBURGER
Ill take care of it Just get out

Mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses
it into a wastebasket He pats the fingertips of one
hand against his tongue and then efficiently pats out
the crinkling orange circle on the top sheet of the
contract

At the other end of the office Norville is wrapping his
arms around the glass water tank which he pulls off its
base He runs back across the vast expanse of office
toward the desk hugging the water tank whose WATER
GLOOB-GLOOBS out its open bottom and splashes down onto
his pumping knees

As he reaches the desk the near-empty tank is now light
enough for him to hoist with one arm which he does and
cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub

of water He tosses the TANK to the floor where --
CRASH -- it SHATTERS and stands looking about for a
place to dump his handful of water

MUSSBURGER
Why you nitwit You almost
destroyed the most sensitive
deal of my career

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the
desk which Mussburger cannot see

It is sprouting flame at which Norville ineffectually
flecks his remaining drops of water

MUSSBURGER
Now out of here Out

( ) 19

Norville is already running to the window which he runs
both palms over desperately seeking a way to open it

MUSSBURGER
Not that way Through the door

NORVILLE
But sir

The windows do not open Norville furiously stomps on
the flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks
Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket
roar up and down with his foot

MUSSBURGER
Right away buster Out of my office

Norville has dropped to the floor trying to wrench
the flaming wastebasket off his leg

MUSSBURGER
Up on your feet We dont crawl at
Hudsucker Industries

NORVILLE
Sir my leg is on fire

Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming waste-
basket off his foot Now the problem is what to do with
it
MUSSBURGER
Get out of this office you
dithering nincompoop

Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

He winds up and throws it through the closed window
The GLASS SHATTERS and the flaming basket plummets to
oblivion

With the picture window broken a FEROCIOUS DRAFT ROARS
through the penthouse office

CLOSE SHOT - BUMSTEAD CONTRACTS

On the desk The pages are sucked away by the draft

MUSSBURGER
My God The Bumstead contracts

( ) 19

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked
out the window

He runs jumps onto the sill grabs -- his fist
clenches around one wafting page -- he is about to fall --
MUSSBURGER
Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh
CUT TO

screaming at an OS secretary He holds a pot of coffee
in one hand and a copy of Boys Life in the other

In the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper
fluttering down

BACK TO MUSSBURGERS PANTS 21
The tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops the rest
of the pants hold intact
MUSSBURGER

sighs with relief

21

He looks up

NORVILLE

Norvilles arms are wrapped around Mussburgers ankles
the heels of Mussburgers shoes are digging into his
face

MUSSBURGER

Looking Thinking

NORVILLE

Struggling to hold on

MUSSBURGER
Calm Contemplating

MUSSBURGER
Hmmm

He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and
sticks it in his mouth He holds his lighter under the
cigar not noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong
way

He looks at Norville

NORVILLE 24

His face drawn with effort still struggling to hang on
A PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS however
that Norvilles arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness
Mussburgers legs are gone

Norville throws his head back and laughs it seems
insanely -- but PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville
is merely pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of
the board members including Mussburger They stand
around Mussburgers office laughing gaily All safe
now no harm done This inaugurates

As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown
onto his face and he continues to swivel
PULL BACK REVEALS that he is in a barber chair

His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling
chair is cranked down but immediately -- still
spinning --

Still laughing Norville is now freshly shaven and has
a slicked-back haircut heavy with pomade

On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing outside his
window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock
rumbles by sweeping a shadow across the floor Evil
prevails

As Mussburger opens the newspaper the TRACK IN

The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office
leaving Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT
His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office

Norvilles laughter is just winding down leaving him
exhausted as if he has been laughing nonstop for

several days He finally sighs and wipes a tear from
his eye
FADE OUT

In the skyline we can see the Hudsucker building topped
by the Hudsucker clock

A cigar ENTERS FRAME in the fg then the face of the

it from his mouth and waves it as if painting a headline

they are more bored than attentive

The Editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in
disgust

slammed down the lid of the cigar box on his desk towards
which one Reporters hand had been idly reaching

The Reporter jerks his fingers away as the Editor spares
the briefest moment to glare at him

Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps
Norville on the shoulder

MUSSBURGER
Relax Norville Its only
natural in a period of transition
for the more nervous element to
run for cover

NORVILLE
Okay Sid Like I said youre

Norville is still loping behind Mussburger trying to
keep up with his long strides

NORVILLE

day I was promoted

MUSSBURGER
I do remember and I was impressed

NORVILLE
Thank you Sid but the reason I

such a small capital investment --

MUSSBURGER
Damnit wheres my car

NORVILLE
-- But theres such an enormous
potential profit-wise given the
demographics -- baby boom --
discretionary income in the
burgeoning middle class --

A black limousine pulls up to the curb

MUSSBURGER
Finally

NORVILLE
-- So if you think its appropriate

Veteran 1s enunciation of lumbago falls into perfect
sync with the womans moving lips

Norville is listening sympathetically but he suddenly
notices his watch

VETERAN 1 (0S)

Shes losing him Bennie

Norville is rising to his feet

VETERAN 2 (0S)
Maybe hes wise

VETERAN 1 (0S)
He dont look wise

As Norville turns to leave

VETERAN 2 (0S)
How does she pull this out

She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her
forehead

VETERAN 1 (0S)
(disbelieving)
She isnt

VETERAN 2 (0S)
(thrilled)
She is

And indeed she does Faint dead away falling backwards
on the stool so that Norville has no choice but to
catch her

Norville holds her awkwardly looking around for help

VETERAN 1 (0S)
Shes good Bennie

VETERAN 2 (0S)
Shes damn good Lou

A WAITRESS enters extreme fg to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the
swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville The Waitress
is FACING the CAMERA and the two OS Veterans the
CROPPING gives us only her torso and the steaming pot

of coffee she holds

WAITRESS

Can I get you boys anything else

INT NORVILLES OFFICE 35

Looking at its frosted-glass door the sign painter is
just finishing lettering in NORVILLE BARNES President

The sign painter makes way as we see Norvilles shadow
approaching even from inside the room we can hear that
he is WHEEZING HEAVILY He is apparently carrying the
girl cradled in his arms He tries to reach down to get
the doorknob cant manage it turns to press his back
against the door and get the knob with his other hand

( )

35

The door opens as Norville swings around to enter He
is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode

He swings around to kick the door shut We see that the
lettering on the door is now terribly smudged we also
see in wet ink on the seat of Norvilles pants senraB
ellivroN tnediserP

Weakly still cradled in Norvilles arms

AMY
Im sorry we had to take the
stairs It was just that horrible

little elevator boy

NORVILLE
Not at all Youre light as a
feather

AMY

(pointing languorously)
The couch please

Still wheezing horribly Norville staggers over to the
couch and deposits her gently on it He straightens up
and looks at her

NORVILLES POV

She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA The entire IMAGE
PULSATES as the blood pounds behind Norvilles eyeballs
We hear the LOUD RASPING of his BREATH resonating
inside his head Amy is talking but her voice is barely
audible as if coming from a long way away

BACK TO SCENE

NORVILLE
Just a minute

He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts
his head between his knees still fighting for breath

AMY
I dont know what came over me I
suppose it was the shock of eating
after so long without the enzymes
kicking in after so long or
whatever But then you couldnt
possibly know what it is to be
tired and hungry

Speaking into his knees as he wheezes
( ) 35

NORVILLE
Hungry anyway

AMY
I dont want to bore you with
all the sordid details of my
life its not a happy story

Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind
her head

AMY

Suffice it to say that Im
jobless -- though not for want of
trying that Im friendless with
no one to -- thank you -- take
care of me and that had you not
come along at just exactly the
moment that you did --

She screams staring down at the couch
Norville jumps startled then looks where she is looking

On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is
printed in wet ink right side around NORVILLE BARNES
President

AMY
Norville I didnt know you were
president here

Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion When
the nickel finally drops he spins around to try to look
at the seat of his pants

Distracted but still modest

NORVILLE
Oh its nothing really Just
determination and hard work

He unbuckles his trousers

NORVILLE
Of course when I started in
the mailroom last Tuesday I
thought it might take more time --

Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag

BUZZ
Say buddy heres the whiskey
you asked f --
( )

He freezes taking in the scene Amy reclining on the
couch Norville standing in front of her with his pants
around his ankles still breathing heavily the bottle of
whiskey in his own hand

NORVILLE
(flustered)
Thank you Buzz just leave it on
the desk
Leering

BUZZ
Happy days buddy

As he turns to leave
BUZZ
and Ill tell your secretary
youre not to be disturbed
Yowzuh

He snaps the elastic strap under his chin

After the doors shut behind Buzz

AMY
(shuddering)
What a horrible little person
NORVILLE
Oh Buzz is pretty harmless
really --
AMY

At any rate I arrived in town not
ten days ago full of dreams and
aspirations anxious to make my
way in the world --

Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to
her

AMY
A little naive perhaps but -- thank
you -- armed with determination

a solid work ethic and an
indomitable belief in the future --

NORVILLE
I myself --

He crosses back to the desk

( ) 35

AMY
Only to have that belief that
unsullied optimism dashed against
the marble and mortar of the
modern work place --

Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette
box on the desk and sticks it in his mouth

NORVILLE
Cigarette

AMY
No thank you Seek and ye shall
find work and ye shall prosper --
these were the watch words of my
education the ethics of my
tender years --

OVER NORVILLES SHOULDER

He has been pushing the box towards her The box tilts
lazily forward and then disappears over the far lip of
the desk We hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the
pitter-patter of cigarettes raining onto the carpet

Amys brow crinkles Continuing
AMY
-- these were the values that were
instilled in me while I was growing
up in a little town youve probably
never heard of --

NORVILLE
Mind if I join you

He is pouring himself a drink
AMY
Be my guest A little town
youve probably --
He tosses back his drink gags looks at Amy with his
eyes bulging
HIS POV

Once again her IMAGE PULSATES There is a ROARING SOUND
and an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips

( ) 35
NORVILLE

He waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as
he staggers to his feet

NORVILLE
Excuse me -- I -- executive
washroom

He staggers out a side door

On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to
his desk At the top of her voice

AMY
Are you all right

She throws open the top desk drawer Inside two lonely
lead pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer

Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes
a match off the desktop

AMY
Is it your lunch The chicken
a la king

From the washroom

NORVILLE (0S)
No I --

Amy throws open another drawer empty except for an
appointment book As she hurriedly flips through page
after blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness One
page only has a notation 1145 Address Wilkie Grammar
School Junior Achievers Club

AMY
Is the a la king repeating on you

Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer

NORVILLE (0S)

Im fine I You were saying
She mutters
AMY
Values watchwords uh tender
years
(aloud)

-- A little town youve probably
never heard of

( ) 35

She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand
to disperse the smoke

AMY
Muncie Indiana

She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET
BEING TURNED OFF she restrikes her languid pose on the
couch just as the washroom door opens

Norville gapes one hand pressing a dripping rag to his
forehead

NORVILLE
Youre from Muncie

AMY
Why yes do you know it

Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists
and loud syncopated grunting noises Amy gapes at him

He starts singing off-key

NORVILLE
Fight on fight on dear old Muncie
Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue

Youll be tattered torn and hurtin
Once The Munce is done with you

Amy lamely fakes singing along coming in louder on the
last obvious rhyme Norville jumps an octave on it
she quickly follows sit also pumping her fists

As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in
front of his nose to make bird wings of his extended
fingers

NORVILLE
Gooooocooco Eagles

Amy awkwardly imitates
Norville excitedly sits behind his desk

NORVILLE
-- A Muncie girl Talk about the
cats pyjamas Tell you what Amy
Im gonna cancel the rest of my
appointments this afternoon and
get you a job here at the Hud

AMY
Oh no really I --

( ) 35

NORVILLE
Dont bother to thank me its the
easiest thing in the world Matter
of fact I know where a vacancy
just came up

He hits the intercom

To Amy

NORVILLE

NORVILLE

NORVILLE
Oh of all the foolish Listen

( )

35 35

AMY

Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm

NORVILLE
-- A Muncie girl Can you beat that

AMY
Well I just dont know how to
thank you Mr Barnes --

NORVILLE
Please Norville

As he reaches to shake

NORVILLE
Its my pleasure

She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away
and winking at her hooks thumbs in front of his
nose and makes wings of his fingers

NORVILLE
Gooooococo Eagles

likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose

His face twisting with fury he leans forward and hits

NORVILLE
Miss Smith can you come in please
to take a letter

Muttering to himself

NORVILLE
- of all the cockamamie

Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil
As she seats herself in front of his desk he rises
to pace behind it

NORVILLE
-- Did you happen to see the front
page of todays Manhattan Argus

AMY
Well I didnt bother to read
the article I didnt think the
picture did you justice

NORVILLE
The picture was fine Its what
that knuckle-headed dame wrote
underneath Of all the
irresponsible Amy take this
down Dear Miss Archer I call
you Miss because you seem to
have missed the boat completely
on this one How on earth would
you know whether Im an imbecile
when you dont even have the guts
to come in here and interview me
man to man No change ‘guts to
courage No make it ‘common
decency These wild speculations
about my intelligence --

AMY
-- or lack thereof

NORVILLE
(nodding)
-- these preposterous inventions
would be better suited to the

He drifts 38

NORVILLE (CONTD)
If the editors of the Manhattan
Argus see fit to publish the
rantings of a disordered mind
perhaps they will see fit to
publish this letter But I doubt
it I most seriously doubt it
As I doubt also that you could
find a home at Amazing Tales a
periodical which I have enjoyed
for many years Yours sincerely
et cetera

into thought

AMY
Is that all Mr Barnes

NORVILLE
Well you know me Amy at
least better than that that
dame does Do you think Im an
imbecile

AMY
Im sure I --

NORVILLE
Go on tell the truth I trust you
and I put a lot of stock in your

opinion
AMY
Well I --
NORVILLE
Oh sure youre biased -- youre a

fellow Muncian But would an
imbecile come up with this

He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on
an easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with
a circle rendered onto it

Amy looks puzzled from the circle to Norvilles
proudly beaming face

NORVILLE
I designed it myself and this
is just the sweet baby that can
put Hudsucker right back on top

( ) 38

Amy is bewildered Norville explains

NORVILLE
You know For kids

AMY
Why dont I just type this
up

NORVILLE
Aww naw Amy that wont be
necessary I shouldnt send it
shes just doing her job I guess

AMY
Well I dont know maybe she does
deserve it Maybe she shouldve
come in to face you man to man

NORVILLE
Well she probably had a deadline

AMY
Sure but -- she could still have
gotten your side for the record

NORVILLE
Well its done now -- whats the
use of grousing about it Forget
the letter Amy I just had to
blow off some steam

She gets up to leave and is heading for the door when
Norville adds

Amy turns

NORVILLE
Shes probably just a little
confused
at the door
AMY
Confused
NORVILLE

Yeah you know probably one of
these fast-talking career gals
thinks shes one of the boys
Probably is one of the boys if
you know what I mean

( ) 38

AMY
(through clenched
teeth)
Im quite sure I dont know what
you mean

NORVILLE
Yeah you know Suffers from one
of these complexes they have
nowadays Seems pretty obvious
doesnt it Shes probably very
unattractive and bitter about it

AMY
Oh is that it

NORVILLE
Yeah you know Probably dresses
in mens clothing swaps drinks
with the guys at the local watering
hole and hobnobs with some smooth-
talking heel in the newsroom named
Biff or Smoocher or

AMY
Smitty

NORVILLE
Exactly And I bet shes ugly
Real ugly Otherwise why wouldnt
they print her picture next to her
byline

AMY
Maybe she puts her work ahead of
her personal appearance

NORVILLE
I bet thats exactly what she tells
herself But you and I both know
shes just a dried-up bitter old
maid Say how about you and I
grab a little dinner and a show
after work I was thinking maybe
The King and I --

dance

BUSINESSMAN in a tuxedo and a ten-gallon hat

MUSSBURGER
Norville Barnes allow me to
introduce Mr Zebulon Cardozo one
of Hudsucker Industries largest
and most loyal stockholders

Ignoring Norvilles proffered hand

CARDOZO (BUSINESSMAN)
Dammit boy whats this I hear
about you bein an embecile What

ago my stock was worth twice what
it is now Im considering
dumping the whole shootin match
unless I see some vast improvement
Dammit boy Its a range war
Either you pull our wagons into
a circle or Im pullin out of
the wagon train

Norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of
reassurance

NORVILLE
No need for concern sir its only
natural in a period of transition
for the more timid element to run
for cover --

CARDOZO
So Im yella am I

He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket

CARDOZO
Well see whos yella

starts dragging Norville away

MRS CARDOZO

MUSSBURGER AND NORVILLE

As they make their way through the room Norville is
mopping at his brow with a handkerchief

NORVILLE
Im sorry Sid I thought maybe if
I showed him the long view we
might --

Thump Dabbing at his brow Norville has walked square
into the back of a debonaire man holding a martini
The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him

MUSSBURGER
Norville this is Thorstensen
Finlandsen who heads a radical
splinter group of disgruntled
investors

Norville nervously pumps Findlandsens hand

NORVILLE
Hello Mr Finlandsen so sorry to
meet you -- uh happy to walk
into y-- uh pleased to make
your --

Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at
Norvilles handkerchief which he now holds himself
apparently having been given it during the handshake
He hands it back to Norville

( ) 46

NORVILLE
Thank you sir

He stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as
Findlandsen stares at him Mussburger stands watching
in the executive at-ease hands dug into his pockets

NORVILLE
I understand your concern
about the down-ward you know
but I think youll find under
our strong new leadership

As Norvilles hand drops from his breast pocket the
handkerchief perhaps caught on his sleeve whips out of
the pocket and follows his hand down

Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look
and stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky

Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at
Norville who continues OS

NORVILLE (0S)
We anticipate in short order
an upward

In rapid fire Norville straightens up into -- crunch --
Findlandsen whose head snaps back eyes rolling a hand
pressed to his nose drink sloshing Norville one hand
pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly
waving his hanky for balance takes a staggering step
forward onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned

a dripping icepack against one eye

AMY

NORVILLE
Oh Nothing really just the

AMY

NORVILLE

AMY
Let me hold it or youll have

NORVILLE
Thanks People seem to be pretty
hot over this imbecile story

AMY
Im sorry

NORVILLE
Oh it isnt your fault Amy
Youre the one person whos been
standing by me through all this
As she rolls the pack gently across his eye

( )

They gaze

AMY
Norville theres something I
have to tell you You see Im
not really a secretary

NORVILLE
I know that Amy

AMY
»- You do

NORVILLE

I understand that youre not very
skilled yet in the secretarial
arts Im not that skilled as
president Oh sure I put upa
big front --

(massages his eye)
-- not that everyones buying it

AMY
I believe in you Norville --
At least I believe in your
intentions --

NORVILLE
Oh I dont blame them really
I guess I have sort of made a mess
of things These folks have to
protect their investment Most
of them are very nice people --

AMY
Norville you cant trust people
here like you did in Muncie

out at the city

AMY
» Certain people are --

NORVILLE
Didja ever go to the top of old
man Larsons feed tower and look
out over the town

AMY
- Huh

NORVILLE
You know on farm route 17

AMY
Oh yes In Muncie

( ) 48

NORVILLE
No In Vidalia Farm Route 17

AMY
Uh -- Yes Seventeen Yes I
-- well no I -- I never really

the cutest little place near my
apartment in Greenwich Village
Its called Anns 440 Its a
beatnik bar

NORVILLE
You dont say

AMY
Yes you can get carrot juice or
Italian coffee and the people

there -- well none of them quite
fit in Youd love it -- why dont
you come there with me -- theyre
having a marathon poetry reading
on New Years Eve I go every
year

NORVILLE

(puzzled)

Every year

AMY
Well -- this year -- if its good

I plan to make it a tradition
I uh my it certainly is
beautiful --

She nods out at the city to avoid Norvilles quizzical

look

AMY
» The people look like ants

NORVILLE
Well the Hindus say -- and the
beatniks also -- that in the next
life some of us will come back
as ants Some will be butterflies
Others will be elephants or
creatures of the sea

AMY
What a beautiful thought

NORVILLE
What do you think you were in
your previous life Amy
( )

Morosely 48

AMY
Oh I dont know Maybe I was
just a fast-talking career gal
who thought she was one of the
boys --

NORVILLE
Oh no Amy pardon me for saying
so but I find that very far-
fetched

AMY
Norville there really is something
I have to tell you --

NORVILLE
That kind of person would come
back as a wildebeest or a warthog
No I think it more likely that
you were a gazelle with long
graceful legs gamboling through
the underbrush Perhaps we met
once a chance encounter in a

forest glade I must have been
an antelope or an ibex What
times we must have had -- foraging

together for sustenance picking
the grubs and burrs from one
anothers coats Or perhaps we
simply touched our horns briefly
and went our separate ways

AMY
I wish it were that simple
Norville I wish I was still a
gazelle and you were an antelope
or an ibex

NORVILLE
Well can I at least call you
deer Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Seriously
Amy the whole thing is what your
beatnik friends call ‘karma’ --
the great circle of life death
and rebirth

AMY
Yeah I think Ive heard of that
What goes around comes around

NORVILLE

be compensated for that

PULL BACK FROM

WEEPING EXECUTIVE 79

The PULL BACK FROM a blubbering executive REVEALS that we
are at a Board meeting All of the Board members sit
around the table except for Mussburger who a towel
around his waist is receiving a choppity-chop massage

on a padded table from a muscular man in a bulging
T-shirt

MUSSBURGER
Pull yourself together Addison

Addison snuffles

ADDISON
Nobody told me Nobody told me
You sold all of our stock

MUSSBURGER
We dumped the whole load Now
quit showboating Addison --

ADDISON
I had twenty thousand shares Id
be a millionaire now

MUSSBURGER
Sure sure wed all be
millionaires Theres no point
in looking back At the time
Stilson thought dumping our
position would panic the market
further depress the stock -- then
wed buy it all back and more of
course once it got cheap --

ADDISON
Cheap Cheap Its never been
more valuable And Im ruined
Ruined

He climbs up onto the board table

ADDISON
Im getting off this merry-go-
round

EXECUTIVE

ADDISON
Aaaaahhh

He runs down the length of the table and hurls
himself toward the window and

Thwok

CUT TO

MUSSBURGERS OFFICE - ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE

LOOKING IN as Addison flattens against the fg glass
his face squushing his outflung hands likewise

All stare in horror for a long silent beat
With the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass
Addison still frozen slides down the window hits the

floor and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree

Mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth

MUSSBURGER
Plexiglas Had it installed last
week

MUSSBURGER

All right so the kid caught a
wave So right now he and his
dingus are on top Well this too
shall pass Myrtle J Mussburger
didnt raise her boy to go knock-
kneed at the first sign of
adversity I say we made this
kid and we can break him I say
the higher he climbs the harder
he drops I say yes the kid has
a future and in it I see shame
dishonor ignominy and disgrace
Sure sure the wheel turns the
music plays and our spin aint
over yet

NORVILLES OFFICE 80

A small chamber orchestra the musicians in tails sit
playing Eine Kleine Nachtmusik Norville eyes closed
reclines in his desk chair one uniformed woman stooping
in front of him manicuring his nails another behind
massaging his temples A tailor is pinning up his pant
cuffs

( )

80
A French sculptor wearing a white smock a beret and
a goatee squints at Norville and chisels at a block of

marble with a stone chisel and hammer

A GOON sits off to one side hat insolently atop his
head reading the funny papers

At length Norville stirs opens his eyes sits bolt
upright batting away the hands of the manicurist and
temple-massager

NORVILLE
Hold it

The musicians playing dribbles away to silence

NORVILLE
-- Nobody move nobody breathe

All sit frozen You could hear a pin drop

NORVILLE
An idea is coming

Eyes narrowed he gazes off into space squinting for
his idea

CLOSE ON TAILORS KIT

A straight pin is rolling across the top -- it drops
off --

EXTREME CLOSE ON FLOOR

Where the PIN -- PING -- hits

NORVILLE
Deflates He glares at the tailor

NORVILLE
Its gone now

The musicians resume playing Everyone else resumes
work The INTERCOM BUZZES and a female voice announces

FEMALE (VO)
Miss Amy here to see you

Norville leans forward to hit his intercom

( )

NORVILLE
Is she in the book --

The door bursts open and Amy storms in

AMY

For Petes sake Norville
NORVILLE

Oh Hello Amy -- was it -- I

thought she said Mamie --

AMY
Never mind about that

She shakes a piece of paper at Norville
AMY

» You know what those nincompoops
in the boardroom are doing

NORVILLE
Well I wouldnt call them
nincom --

AMY

Theyre going to discharge eight
percent of the work force here

at Hudsucker Why in New York
alone that means eighteen hundred
people out of work people with
wives and children and families --

NORVILLE
Well yes were pruning away some
of the dead wood but if --

AMY
You mean you know about this

NORVILLE
Know about it You think the
Board would do anything like this
without my authorization No
this was my idea from the start

AMY
Your i --

NORVILLE
We have to be realistic Amy You
know things have slowed down a
little here at Hudsucker --

( ) 80
AMY
Youre awful kind to yourself
Norville Barnes -- the fact is

youve slowed down sitting up
here like a sultan not doing a
lick of work Why you know its
ideas that are the lifeblood of
industry and you havent come up
with one since the hoop and the
reasons plain to see Youve
forgotten what made your ideas
exciting for you in the first
place -- it wasnt for the fame
and the wealth and the mindless
adulation of -- would you get out
of here

This was addressed to the chamber orchestra whose
playing dribbles off They look inquisitively at

Norville

then rise to pack up their instruments and

sheepishly leave the office

AMY
Ive been watching you
Norville Barnes even though
youve been trying to avoid me --

NORVILLE
Now Aim --
AMY
Shutup -- and dont think I

havent noticed how youve changed
I used to think you were a swell
guy -- well to be honest I thought
you were an imbecile --

NORVILLE
Now Aim --
AMY
Shutup -- but then I figured out

you were a swell guy a little
slow maybe but a swell guy
Well maybe youre not so slow
but youre not so swell either
and it looks like youre an
imbecile after --

NORVILLE
Now Aim --

( ) 80

AMY
Shutup -- after all You havent
talked to me for a week and now
Im going to say my piece Ive
got a prediction for you Norville
Barnes I predict that since
youve decided to dedicate
yourself to greed and sloth and
everything bad youre going to
lose all the good things that
your good ideas brought you
Youre going to throw them all
away chasing after money and
ease and the respect of a Board
that wouldnt give you the time
of day if you if you

NORVILLE
Worked in a watch factory

The Goon looks up from his funnies

GOON
Huh-huh-huh

AMY

(to the Goon)
Shutup

(to Norville)
Exactly Dont you remember how
you used to feel about the hoop
You told me you were gonna bring
a smile to the hips of everyone
in America regardless of race
creed or color Finally thered
be a thingamajig that would bring
everyone together -- even if it
kept em apart spacially -- you
know for kids Your words
Norville not mine I used to
love Norville Barnes -- yes love

kid with hot ideas who was in

is too big to be in over

NORVILLE

AMY
Consider this my resignation --

Thwock -- She slaps him

The bodyguard is on his feet

GOON

MUSSBURGER

Hmmm Thank you Aloysius This

Aloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave

As we TRACK IN ON the picture of Amy we

FADE OUT

FADE UP TO
PERFECT WHITE
After a beat a woman ENTERS against the unblemished
white background dressed in a flowing white dance robe
trailing a long diaphanous veil She performs a flow-
ingly sensuous dance moderne the MUSIC is a sensuous
saxophone solo with lasciviously bending blue notes
After the woman has been dancing for several beats
Norville enters dancing after her pursuing her He
is wearing a coatless suit his sleeves rolled up his
thin tie loosened

The woman dances around him letting her diaphanous veil
trail sinuously around his body

We hear an ECHOING voice
VOICE (0S)
Buddy Say buddy
CLOSE SHOT - NORVILLE

Sitting in his desk chair sheened with sweat eyes
closed licking his lips

CLOSER NOW

VOICE (0S)
Buddy Ya busy

NORVILLE
Huh-whuh

He opens his eyes and looks stuporously about

Buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox
elevator cap

BUZZ
Looks like ya nodded off there

Norville clears his throat

NORVILLE
Oh uh Buzz Is it important

BUZZ
I like to think so Its this
little idea I been working on

He turns an easel to face the desk

( )

83

BUZZ
Ya see I dont intend to be
an elevator boy forever Take a
look at this sweet baby

The easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper
Onto it has been rendered a top view which is a perfect
circle and a side view which is a vertical line

Norville gazes stupidly at the circle

BUZZ
Ya get it buddy Incredibly
convenient isnt it Ya see --

He produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting
in it

BUZZ
-- this is how it works its
these little ridges on the side
that give it its whammy See ya
dont have to drink like this
anymore --

He holds his head over the glass to drink from the
vertical straw

BUZZ
-- Now you can drink like this --

He bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal

BUZZ
I call it the Buzz-Sucker get
it buddy -- After me Buzz

Why people are just dyin fora
product like this and the great
thing is we wont have to charge
an arm and a --

Norville who has been stewing finally barks

NORVILLE
Wait a minute

He grabs the lemonade glass looks at it sneering

NORVILLE
Why this is worthless

BUZZ
Huh But buddy --

( ) 83
Norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up

NORVILLE
This is the most idiotic thing Ive
ever seen in my life

BUZZ
Yeah but buddy --

NORVILLE
Nobody wants a hare-brained
product like this Ya see Buzz
it lacks the creative spark the
unalloyed genius that made uh

He pauses to belch

NORVILLE
- Say the hula hoop such a
success

BUZZ
But buddy --

NORVILLE

And what do you mean barging in
here and taking up my valuable
time Ive got a company to run
here --

BUZZ
But buddy you were --

NORVILLE
-- I cant have every deadbeat on
the Hudsucker payroll pestering me

BUZZ
Geez Im sorry buddy --

NORVILLE
An example must be made

Buzz looks over his shoulder turns back to Norville

BUZZ
Wuddya mean buddy

NORVILLE
Fired Youre fired Is that

Buzzs jaw drops His elastic chin strap snaps under
the pressure
( )

83 83
BUZZ

Buzz sinks to his knees weeping He clutches
pathetically at Norvilles pants legs

BUZZ

Buzz-Sucker Just lemme keep my

Buzz stumbles away still weeping

BUZZ

Im sorry buddy Im sorry
NORVILLE

Buzz off Ha-ha-ha-ha

As we TRACK IN ON Norville laughing there is a low
unearthly RUMBLE and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO

84 FLAMES 84

We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburgers oversized
lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar

He is sitting alone in the boardroom but its door swings
open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers a little
cap and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to
bulge He has a full golf bag over his shoulder

NORVILLE
Sorry Im late Sid That back
nine at Riverdale is really
murder

( )

MUSSBURGER

security problems here at the Hud

NORVILLE
Ya dont say

MUSSBURGER

you with it but -- this is
embarrassing kid -- it seems to
concern you directly

NORVILLE
Hows that Sid

MUSSBURGER

to me claiming youd stolen the
idea for the uh the hoop dingus
from him --

NORVILLE
Huh He -- no I -- hes just
-- maybe I was a little rough on

MUSSBURGER
Ah forget it kid ya dont have

a nuisance But it seems -- well

He is shoving a file towards Norville who opens it

MUSSBURGER
Sure sure we tried to kill
the story But her newspaper
wont play ball Looks like her
storys coming out

We TRACK DOWN the length of the board room table TOWARD
Norville who stares horrified at the file

MUSSBURGER

NORVILLE
You lied to me I cant believe

He lurches off his stool toward the door Watching him
despair fights with confusion on Amys face

AMY
But Norville I

She realizes that though shattered he is still the
simple innocent she loved --

Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet
and is putting it on HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOMThe Future Is

SECOND HAND

Descending

NORVILLE 101
Falling turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly with

a great moaning sound -- he stops suspended in mid-air

head down feet in the air

It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that
the title of the film was supered over

He waves his arms to no effect looks around

PEOPLE IN STREET 104
Frozen in attitudes of laughter celebration Snow sifts
silently down around their motionless bodies

MUSSBURGER 102
In his office frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his
face

HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS

Twisting back to look up over his shoulder there is a
DISTANT -- very distant -- SINGING

Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building Someone
or something wrapped in white is flying toward us coming
down from the stars

We can make out a male voice accompanied by STRUMMING

NORVILLE

He gapes

ANGEL

-- For it is an Angel arrives He is a balding man
wearing rimless glasses in a white robe large feathery
wings sprouting from his back and beating heavily until
he comes to rest in midair He puts aside the harp he
has been strumming on a nearby windowsill

ANGEL

NORVILLE
Mr Mr Hudsucker

HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)
Ta-daaaa

Presenting himself he spreads his arms and stamps his
forward foot forgetting that there is nothing beneath
his foot to stamp He lurches forward momentarily
losing his balance

HUDSUCKER
Wooooo

He rights himself The halo spinning lazily over his head
has been jarred askew With a flick of his forefinger he
rights it

HUDSUCKER
How dya like this thing
Theyre all wearin em upstairs

He blows a dismissive raspberry

HUDSUCKER
Its a fad

He pats at his robe produces a white cigar

HUDSUCKER

He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist lighting
it He lights the cigar off his thumb takes a puff

HUDSUCKER

Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his
flaming thumb which he now waves frantically about

HUDSUCKER

NORVILLE
Huh Oh geez Mr Hudsucker

lot of excitement and I guess I

HUDSUCKER
Its sittin in your apron pocket
right where you left it

Imbecile
Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue
Letter
NORVILLE
Oh geez
HUDSUCKER

Failure to deliver a Blue Letter
is grounds for dismissal

NORVILLE
Geez I --

HUDSUCKER
Ah its New Years Im not

NORVILLE

HUDSUCKER

Well why dont ya read it

NORVILLE
Sir

( )

105 105
HUDSUCKER
Yeah go ahead Might learn
somethin
NORVILLE
Yes sir

He tears open the envelope reads

NORVILLE
From the desk of Waring
Hudsucker To Sidney J
Mussburger Regarding My
demise Dear Sid By the time
you read this I will have joined
the organization upstairs -- an
exciting new beginning I will
retain fond memories of the many
years you and I --

HUDSUCKER
Yeah yeah its the standard
resignation boilerplate -- go down

to the second paragraph

NORVILLE
Many years uh I know that
you will be wondering why I have
decided to move on ending my
tenure at Hudsucker and here on
Earth You will be thinking Why
now when things are going so
well Granted from the standpoint
of our balance sheet and
financials sure sure were
doing fine However Sid These
things have long since ceased to
give me pleasure I look at
myself now and no longer see the
idealistic young man who started
this company Now I see only an
empty shell whom others call a
success How has this come to
pass When and why did I trade
all of my hopes dreams and
aspirations for the emptiness
of power and wealth What the
heck have I done

As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his
fingernails then pats down a yawn

( ) 105

NORVILLE
- Looking back now Sid I see
that I allowed time and age to
corrupt my dreams instead of
fiercely guarding what was
timeless inside of myself I let
the hubbub of earthly commerce
erode my character and dissolve
my better self How is it that
some manage to preserve
themselves where I have failed
Sidney I do not know Perhaps
if others love you you may more

securely love yourself -- but I
am alone I loved a woman once
Sid as you well know -- a

beautiful vibrant lady an angel
who in her wisdom saw fit to
choose you instead of I

Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering He looks up
Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief
He saws at his nose gives it a loud honk and urgently

quavers in a voice strangled with emotion

HUDSUCKER
Skip this part

He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles
HUDSUCKER
Last paragraph last
paragraph

Norville looks down the page

NORVILLE
And so Sid the future does
not belong to such as I -- nor

even you We have made our
compromises with time The
future belongs to the young who
May more energetically wage the
battle against corruption
Accordingly in the spirit of
hope and the ringing in of the
new I hereby bequeath my entire
interest in the company and my
seat on the board to whomever is
Hudsuckers most recent employee
at the time of my demise

(MORE )

( ) 105

NORVILLE (CONTD)
I know this will disappoint

you -- you Sid who have served
so diligently and for so long
But --

HUDSUCKER

-- tough titty toenails
He roars with laughter

HUDSUCKER
Thatll show the bastard

He merrily wipes his eyes

HUDSUCKER
Yeah go ahead

NORVILLE
But Sid let me urge you to
work closely with the new
president and to keep giving
Hudsucker Industries all your
energies -- but not your soul
For while we must strive for
success we must not worship it
Long live the Hud Waring
Hudsucker’

Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod

HUDSUCKER
Geez

Pleased with himself
HUDSUCKER
Yup Its all there Well see
that it gets delivered in the
morning

Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the
stars

HUDSUCKER
Sheeel beeee
