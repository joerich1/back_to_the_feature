FADE IN

EXT ASMARA ERITREA -- DAY
North Africa

Hot crowded dusty streets Vendors hawking goods outside
of packed storefronts And through this scene passes

A BEAT-UP TOYOTA SUV

INT TOYOTA SUV MOVING -- DAY
Cruising at a brisk bumpy speed

A taxi carrying three passengers Not from around here
In the front a burly man with a bushy beard MANTICORE
(30s) In the back RAVAN (30s) lean Middle Eastern
with a compact athletic build

And next to him is RUSTAM (30s) Hes the one we should
be worrying about Intense psychopath The man in charge

They are flipping through SCHEMATIC BLUEPRINTS

The DRIVER -- young probably 16 -- glances at the rear
view mirror curious as to what his passengers are doing
All he gets is a dead stare from Rustam Averts his eyes
Finally Rustam snatches the blueprints from his partners
hands and HOLDS THEM TO A LIGHTER Burning them as he --
EXT STREETS OF ASMARA -- DAY

Tosses them out the window

The FIREBALL settles to the ground The SUV drives off

EXT ASMARA AIRPORT FRONT CURB -- DAY

AFRICAN SOLDIERS monitor the airport 50-cal guns ready
The TOYOTA SUV stops in the crowd Its THREE PASSENGERS
disembark and disperse without looking at each other
EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY

A GULFSTREAM G550

Touches down on the tarmac Russian lettering on the
side It taxis towards a petrol kiosk

( )

Mechanics run to the plane and begin refueling

The door cranks open and TWO AGENTS get out surveying
the run-down airport with hawklike precision

INT GULFSTREAM G550 -- CONTINUOUS

A nervous COURIER waits inside

AGENT (in Russian)
Twenty minutes to refuel

COURIER
Make it fast

ON THE COURIERS WRIST is a handcuff attached to a STEEL
BRIEFCASE Whatever this guy is carrying is important
INT ASMARA AIRPORT SECURITY -- DAY

MANTICORE strides through the military-guarded checkpoint
Puts his duffel bag through the scanner

Ahead of him a view of the tarmac And the GULFSTREAM

Manticore flips open a cell phone and SENDS A TEXT MESSAGE

INT BAGGAGE CLAIM -- DAY

RAVAN receives the message and proceeds to security

INT GIFT SHOP -- DAY

RUSTAM is standing by a magazine rack In the mirror he
can see FOUR ARMED SOLDIERS chatting behind him

INT DEPARTURE TERMINAL -- DAY

MANTICORE carries his duffel bag out of security Kneels

beside an OUTLET and pulls out a FLASH DRIVE It PULSES
with light -- as if something were alive inside

He begins wiring it to an AC ADAPTER

INT SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY
RAVAN crosses through the metal detector --

AND IT RINGS

( )

Alerting a SOLDIER who cautiously approaches Ravan
extends his hands waiting for the search

INT DEPARTURE TERMINAL -- DAY

MANTICORE has finished tethering the wires together and
plugs the flash drive into the AC slot

INT SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

--just as the soldier pulls open RAVANs coat to reveal --
DOZENS OF KNIVES

Fastened to his chest via pull-away straps All shapes
and sizes None of them friendly-looking

INT DEPARTURE TERMINAL -- DAY

The flash drive engages We see the lights PULSING as

if the living thing inside it were suddenly being RELEASED
into the voltage and --

INT SECURITY MONITOR ROOM -- DAY

SURVEILLANCE MONITORS suddenly cut out The hint of a

GHOST-LIKE FACE-- belonging to DJINN He has the soul of
aman but he is not a man He is a living computer virus

INT SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

The soldier backs off of RAVAN THE LIGHTS GO OUT

INT GIFT SHOP -- DAY

The gift shop goes dark around RUSTAM Then --

A WHITE LIGHT

Slices through the pitch black Cutting through soldiers
flesh We see NOTHING but we hear EVERYTHING

INT DEPARTURE TERMINAL -- DAY

MANTICORE tosses a soldier into a wall

Another raises a sidearm and FIRES but the bullet BOUNCES

off Manticores shoulder like a pinball He kneels to
the ground raises his fists and --

( )

SLAMS THEM DOWN with incredible superhuman force Like
nothing weve ever seen

The tiled floor CRACKS OPEN like an earthquake sending a
FISSURE towards terrified soldiers and tossing them aside
INT SECURITY MONITOR ROOM -- DAY

Monitors EXPLODE around TECHNICIANS We can make out the
hazy image of DJINN bouncing across the screens

EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY

One of the Russian AGENTS hears sounds of GUNFIRE He
tosses his cigarette and bounds back into the plane

INT DEPARTURE TERMINAL -- DAY

RAVAN meets MANTICORE in the center of the terminal

More soldiers are rushing in Surrounding them Weapons
poised Ravan reaches for his knives

--AND NOW WE SEE WHERE HIS TALENTS LIE

Hes an expert with throwing weapons Juggling them

slicing down half a dozen guards like they were made of
paper Speed plus perfect accuracy

INT SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

Pandemonium Civilians are fleeing the scene

RUSTAM is the only one walking in Stepping over injured
soldiers Passing a scared family Making his way calmly --

inevitably -- towards the departure terminal

And the bastard is WHISTLING

EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY

The Gulfstream begins to taxi down the runway

INT GULFSTREAM G550 -- DAY
The COURIER leans over the PILOTs shoulder

COURIER (in Russian)
Get this plane off the ground
INT DEPARTURE TERMINAL -- DAY

MANTICORE effortlessly knocks out a support post causing
the ceiling to collapse on top of several soldiers

RAVAN watches a soldier flee He tosses a knife that
BOUNCES OFF A WALL twisting around a corner and hitting
the soldier in the back

And RUSTAM continues whistling as he strides past

In front of him are SECURITY-LOCKED DOORS leading to the
tarmac We see the keypads lights SWELLING DJINN is

coursing through its electronics and

the doors UNLOCK just as Rustam pushes outside

EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY

The Gulfstream reaches the edge of the runway Enough

room for a takeoff It turns and centers

INT GULFSTREAM G550 -- DAY

The PILOT angles the accelerators They begin to move

AND THEN HE SEES SOMETHING

-Or someone walking into the middle of the runway
PILOT

What is he doing

EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY

RUSTAM stares down the massive plane as it barrels towards

him Indifferent to the danger Still whistling in

fact He extends his right hand and snaps his fingers as --

A BLAZING LIGHT-BASED SCIMITAR

Suddenly stretches from his fingertips White hot --

able to slice through anything it touches We saw a
glimpse of it in the gift shop

The Gulfstream bears down on him Rustam ducks to one
knee swinging the scimitar in a wide circle and --

CUTTING OFF THE PLANES LANDING GEAR

( )

Causing a chain reaction -- a rapid de-stabilization
The front of the plane suddenly SMASHING TO THE GROUND
sliding along the concrete at a high velocity and --

CARTWHEELING IN A THOUSAND PIECES

Finally the fuel tank catches fire and the plane EXPLODES

INT DEPARTURE TERMINAL -- DAY

WINDOWS BLOW IN pushing the last soldiers to the ground
MANTICORE returns to the AC outlet waiting to see the
RED LIGHT turn GREEN -- indicating DJINN has returned to
the flash drive He removes the disk

EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY

RUSTAM strides through the flaming wreckage The scimitar
disappears from his hand He hovers over

THE STEEL BRIEFCASE

Lying unharmed on the ground The courier it was once
attached to has been incinerated

But Rustam is more fixated on the surrounding flames
MANTICORE and RAVAN approach behind him

RUSTAM
Isnt it beautiful

They pause Rustam breathes it all in Absorbing the
carnage Relishing the silence of its aftermath

Then he turns and walks away Manticore lifts the
briefcase Carrying it with them into the smoke as we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT 93 HIGHWAY -- NIGHT
Boston
A more familiar setting Rain bogs down nighttime traffic

A SEDAN idles on the side of a highway where A THUGGISH
BODYGUARD is waiting coat clenched tightly

A RANGE ROVER pulls onto the shoulder Hazards flashing

( )

Several THUGS get out Among them is VINCENT TARTAGA
(40s) Hes a powerful crime boss but it looks like he
hasnt had a good nights sleep in some time

TARTAGA
What happened

BODYGUARD
This guy shows up takes out three
guards at the booth Then he just
lies down and asks for you

TARTAGA
Are you sure its him

BODYGUARD
He had this on him

The bodyguard OPENS THE TRUCK to reveal A DOZEN PISTOLS

OFF THE THUGS FRIGHTENED FACES

INT SEDAN -- NIGHT
TARTAGA moves in beside the DRIVER

TARTAGA
Drive

They start to go Behind them the Range Rover follows

There are TWO THUGS in the back flanking A TIED-UP MAN
IN A HOOD Bound in a makeshift straight-jacket His
arms fastened against his chest Tartaga nods and they
pull off the hood to reveal --

FLOYD LAWTON (late 30s) The hero of our story But for
reasons were about to understand hes not exactly your
textbook hero On the streets they call him

TARTAGA (CONTD)

Deadshot

LAWTON
Hey Tartaga Youre a hard man to
find

TARTAGA

I havent slept in four days you
know that you sonofabitch

LAWTON
Not on account of me I hope

( )

TARTAGA
What are they paying you to kill
me

LAWTON
Full freight

TARTAGA

You dont think I could double
that get you to come over

LAWTON
Instead of coming after you I
dont think thats gonna work out

TARTAGA
Why not

LAWTON
â€˜Cause I got a reputation to keep
Maybe when Im done Hows that

TARTAGA
When youre done Ill be dead

LAWTON
Yeah Then I dont think its
gonna work out

One of the thugs grunts a laugh Tartaga isnt amused

TARTAGA
Youre some piece of work Deadshot
Ballsiest contract killer I ever
met They oughtta give you some
kind of memorial --

LAWTON
Monument

TARTAGA
Huh

LAWTON

Memorials are for the dead They
give monuments to the living Im
not dead so I get a monument

TARTAGA
Who the hell cares if youre living
or dead

LAWTON

Are we speaking grammatically or
is this a new subject

( )

Another laugh from one of the thugs Meanwhile this
whole time Lawton has been discreetly flexing his fingers

TARTAGA
I bet you enjoy this dont you
These jobs make your life worth
living-- cause in spite of the
fact that youre just another bottom
feeder when youre killing youre
actually on top Aint that right

Lawton shrugs Seemingly indifferent but theres pain
beneath the surface He studies his surroundings

LAWTON
Whats this armored exterior

TARTAGA
Yeah So what

LAWTON
Its nice Tough to shoot through
Couldnt hit you from the outside

Lawton props his feet against the seats in front of him

TARTAGA
Hey-- hey What are you doing

LAWTON
Bracing myself You guys might
want to as well in case youre
still breathing when we hit

And before they can figure it out --
TWO HOLES suddenly pop through Lawtons straight jacket

BULLETS whizzing out of nowhere hitting the armored sides
of the car bouncing around at impossible angles and --

KILLING ALL FOUR MEN IN THE CAR

Lawton pulls back on the torn straight-jacket to reveal
TWO WRIST-MOUNTED PISTOL BARRELS Homemade His
specialty Just small enough to evade detection Just
powerful enough to be deadly as hell

Tartaga is dead -- and the driver is now slumped on the
dashboard Which means this car is out of control

EXT CHARLES RIVER BRIDGE -- NIGHT

The sedan veers right and GOES OVER THE BRIDGE Plummeting
forty feet and sinking rapidly into the river

EXT UNDERWATER -- NIGHT

Water floods in through the broken windows of the sedan
LAWTON effortlessly frees himself of the straight jacket
pulling himself past the corpses and swimming out

EXT CHARLES RIVER BRIDGE -- NIGHT

The Range Rover screeches to a halt and the other
BODYGUARDS run out Staring dumbfounded when suddenly --

FWIPP FWIPP Bullets start flying out FROM UNDERWATER

EXT UNDERWATER -- NIGHT

LAWTONs feet are propped against the hood of the car
Hes firing upwards via his high-powered arm pistols
Small cannons able to penetrate the concentrated medium

THROUGH HIS POV vague murky forms of the bodyguards on
top of the bridge Impossible shots but not for him

One now two dead figures PLUMMET into the water

EXT CHARLES RIVER BRIDGE -- NIGHT

The last standing BODYGUARD hysterically raises his rifle
and FIRES BLINDLY Emptying his entire clip Watching
the water to see if anyone floats up But instead --

ONE MORE BULLET hits him right between the eyes and he
falls like dead weight SPLASHING unceremoniously

EXT CHARLES RIVER EMBANKMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

LAWTON crawls onshore as SIRENS rise in the distance He
looks back -- indifferent A man who truly takes no
pleasure in the joys of his work He limps away

EXT NORTH END DINER -- NIGHT

A quaint all-night diner in a quiet part of town Must
be 3 in the morning by now Rain is still pouring down
INT NORTH END DINER -- NIGHT

The door CHIMES as LAWTON steps in Drenched from head
to toe but whos going to notice with all this rain

( )

Not many customers in here A few lowlifes in various
corners A TV playing news in the background

Lawton sits at the empty counter Reaches into his pocket
for a pack of cigarettes Pulls them out Waterlogged
So much for the cigarettes He sighs wearily

From the kitchen the waitress emerges ZOE College
girl Youthful optimism only a college girl could have

ZOE
Hey stranger

And when Lawton sees her he BRIGHTENS Its not romance --
this relationship is far more complex

LAWTON
How you doing Zoe

ZOE
My shifts done I was about to
hang it up

LAWTON
Well what do you say One cup

She grins pours the coffee --

ZOE
Why not Raining like crazy out
there anyway

LAWTON
Hows school you graduate yet

ZOE
Started BU this fall

LAWTON
Really Whats your major

ZOE
Not sure yet-- psychology maybe

LAWTON
I always took you for an artsy
kind of girl

ZOE
Yeah well artsy-kind-of-girl
doesnt pay the rent I guess

LAWTON
Is that what they say

( )

ZOE
That is How about yourself
Still selling-- what was it
Pharmaceuticals

He darkens slightly Then settles for the lie --

LAWTON
Yeah yeah Same ol

He kicks his wet shoes Theres a fatigue here A sense
of regret over life choices And while Zoe doesnt know
what shes reading she reads right through him

ZOE
Floyd when are you gonna find
yourself a new job Something you
actually like for a change

Lawton wishing it was that easy Covering with a joke --

LAWTON
I dont know-- you guys hiring

Zoe laughs Checks her watch

ZOE
Okay I gotta get up early
(crumbles the bill)
This ones on me Ill see you
next time youre in town right

LAWTON
Sure thing Zoe

ZOE
You good

For a moment it looks like he wants to say something else
We can see him hanging on it but finally

LAWTON

Yeah yeah Im good Go Take

care of yourself

She removes her apron -- dangling it from the door

ZOE

And I mean it Floyd Theres

happiness in a good job You dont

like the one you got get another

LAWTON
Get another I like that

She leaves And his grin fades

( )

ON TV a PUNDIT is arguing with the camera --

TALKING HEAD (on TV)
See now thats exactly whats
wrong with this country Weve
got dangerous enemies at home and
abroad but were less prepared to
deal with em than ever before

Lawton reaches into a pocket and pulls out A DRY ENVELOPE
Recently collected Stacks of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS

TALKING HEAD (on TV) (CONTD)
What Im saying is these days our
greatest enemy is ourselves
HE SLIPS FIVE BILLS INTO ZOES APRON

And as hes about to move for the door --

WALLER (0C)
Do you think hes right

A WOMAN is sitting in a corner booth Tough no-nonsense
Shes eating an impossibly large omelet This is AMANDA
WALLER (black 40s)
WALLER (CONTD)
Are we all just our own worst
enemies

LAWTON
You asking me

WALLER
You are Floyd Lawton arent you

Lawton hesitates On alert
LAWTON
Lady all due respect but what is

it to you who I am

WALLER
Relax Deadshot Have a seat

His eyes dart back to the kitchen
WALLER (CONTD)
Shes gone Heard her go out the

back Its just us now

He reluctantly sits in the booth Waller eats

( )

WALLER (CONTD)
Mmm Cant get breakfast like
this anywhere else in Boston
Its what they call local flavor

LAWTON
Lady what are you selling

WALLER
First of all my name is not lady
Its Amanda Waller I work for
the United States government You
might have heard of us

Its unclear whether shes kidding So she leans in with
a FOLDER in her hand An intelligence briefing on him

WALLER (CONTD)
A situations come up and we need
your help Youre a man of unique
talents Talents that are hard to
find You do what you do primarily
because you are very good at what
you do Some might call you a
criminal But you and I come from
a place that is less concerned
with that distinction I believe
that a bad man under the right
circumstances can do good things
Do you believe that Deadshot

LAWTON
Ms Waller If I ever did what
you think Ive done I assure
you they all had it coming

He stands and wipes his hands

LAWTON (CONTD)
Plus Im out of your price range
So theres nothing to talk about

WALLER
Who said I was offering you a price

Lawton doesnt like her tone He glances around Starts
to notice other things he doesnt like The lowlifes in
the opposite corner A BUM on the outside stoop Theyre
not set dressing Theyre AGENTS Looking his way

WALLER (CONTD)
Youre being renditioned Afraid
I cant give you much choice in
the matter

( )

LAWTON
Good luck Ive shot my way out
of worse rooms than this
WALLER
I dont doubt that you have But
your aim isnt that sharp tonight
is it
He laughs starts to raise his hands when he notices --
THE ROOM IS SPINNING His vision is blurred
He looks back at the cup of coffee he drank from
WALLER (CONTD)
Please dont think this has any
bearing on my respect for you
But you have to understand I
couldnt leave anything to chance

And he DROPS TO THE FLOOR

As Cage the Elephants Aint No Rest for the Wicked
comes blaring into the SOUNDTRACK and we FADE TO

EXT MILITARY HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

Our OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE

LAWTON drifting in and out of consciousness Fastened
by heavy metal restraints inside of a bumping chopper

DROPPING IN LOW OVER A MISTY BAYOU

EXT BELLE REVE PRISON -- NIGHT

A STEEL FORTRESS emerges from the steam The Belle Reve
Prison for Super-Humans A high-security facility built
for criminals with extraordinary talents

ARMED GUARDS rush forward to greet the chopper

INT BELLE REVE PRISON WELCOMING COUNTER -- NIGHT

LAWTON handcuffed and groggy His belongings being thrown
into a cardboard box by a DESK MAN who reads them off

DESK MAN
Five fraudulent passports sixty
cents loose change one pack of

soiled cigarettes and

( )

He curiously lifts THE WRIST-MOUNTED GUN RIG
LAWTON
Ill want those when I get out
INT BELLE REVE PRISON RINSE DOWN -- NIGHT
LAWTON is thrown to a cold linoleum floor in his skivvies
A SERGEANT and his 2 stand over him with a fire hose

SERGEANT

They turn on the hose and Lawton is BLOWN BACK --
-- AS WE FREEZE FRAME --

AND FINALLY SLAM OUR TITLE CARD SUICIDE SQUAD

INT BELLE REVE PRISON PRIVATE QUARTERS -- NIGHT

Passing over FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS on a steel desk A Green
Beret unit SEVERAL DOG TAGS dangling from a lamp And --

The finely-tuned body of CAPTAIN RICK FLAG (30s)

Doing pull-ups on the door-frame A born soldier Never
known anything else Raw order raw discipline Perfect
Unlike Lawton this guy is your textbook hero

WALLER enters tosses a folder on his desk

WALLER
Theyre all yours Captain

Flag picks up the folder Not a man of many words Flips
through Turns to regard --

A WALL OF MONITORS A complete view of A-BLOCK where --

INT BELLE REVE PRISON A-BLOCK -- NIGHT
LAWTON is being paraded down Broadway -- recently deloused

CATCALLS from all sides Tough prisoners yelling out
from behind steel bars He could give a shit

INT BELLE REVE PRISON HOLDING CELL -- NIGHT

LAWTON is tossed into his cell The doors SLAM SHUT He
rises looks around About to touch the bars when --

( )

HARKNESS
Wouldnt put me hands on those
bars mate

DIGGER HARKNESS (early 20s) sits in an adjacent cell
Australian His hands are immersed in solid lead gloves

HARKNESS (CONTD)
Might get a bit of a surprise

He gestures to another cell where a BIG MAN is pacing
like a wild animal Hes testing each bar -- getting an
ELECTRIC SHOCK each time

HARKNESS (CONTD)
Blockbuster he can take it But
you I dunno Takes a special
kind of toughness to make it in
here and I aint sure ya got it

LAWTON
Belle Reve Thought this place
was just a rumor

HARKNESS
Sure-- a rumor Like you aint
really here and we aint really
talkin

Another PRISONER calls out from his cell --

PRISONER (0C)
Wouldnt that be the day Harkness

HARKNESS
Yeah yeah

Lawton scans his surroundings

LAWTON
Doesnt make sense throwing me in
here I didnt get a trial

HARKNESS
Yah well Waller does what she
wants She dont care bout super-
human scum like you and me Any
more than she cares â€˜bout
Blockbuster over there or Mirror
Master or that guy in Cell Block
D shoots lasers outta his arse --

ANOTHER PRISONER (0C)
Harkness would you shut up

He spins towards the rest of the annoyed prisoners --

( )

HARKNESS
Hey Im talkin to the new guy

PRISONER
No we hear how youre talking
Its all we hear all the time

HARKNESS
Mate if I didnt have me hands

LAWTON
She mentioned something to me about

Laughing his ass off --
HARKNESS

LAWTON leaning back Wondering just how he got into
this bullshit situation as we CUT TO --
INT BELLE REVE PRISON HOLDING CELL -- NIGHT

Prisoners sleeping in their cells HARKNESS snoring
away Even in his sleep hes loud as hell

LAWTON is wide awake Staring at the ceiling

When he hears a HISSING NOISE From the vent above a
PURPLISH GAS flows into the cell A toxin

-which reaches Lawtons lungs and HE PASSES OUT

TO BLACK

( )

Sounds of CHILDRENS LAUGHTER Vague distant And then --

INT BELLE REVE PRISON MEDLAB -- NIGHT

BLURRY SHOTS of DOCTORS working on THE PRISONERS

LAWTON groggily looks about His hands and legs are tied
A doctor is INSERTING A TUBE INTO HIS ARM and we FADE TO --
EXT BOSTON PLAYGROUND -- DAY --- DREAM SEQUENCE

Memories of children playing A jungle gym A see-saw
A LITTLE GIRL going down a slide in SLOW MOTION

And a younger LAWTON hands stuffed in his pockets
watching from across the street as we SLAM BACK TO --
INT BELLE REVE PRISON HANGAR -- DAY

A BRIGHT SHINING LIGHT

LAWTON sits up No idea how much time has passed Hes
lying on the floor amidst a dozen other PRISONERS
HARKNESS is there as are a few of the other faces weve
glimpsed Theyre groggy disoriented

Theres a SCAR on their forearms but more on this later

SPOTLIGHTS slam on around them They are inside a hangar
Surrounded by ARMED SOLDIERS

FLAG (0C)
Rise and shine jail-birds

And RICK FLAG steps forward A drill-sergeants scowl
Our first time beholding this bulldog in his element

HARKNESS
You talkin to us mate

FLAG
Yes I am What is your name

HARKNESS
How come ya wanna know my name

FLAG staring through HARKNESS Pure contempt And for
a brief instant we have no idea what hes going to do

--until he SWIPES HARKNESSS LEGS laying him out with a
boot to his throat A swift and efficient takedown

( )

FLAG
You listen and you listen good I
dont know where along the path of
your wayward little life you took
a wrong turn-- but it is my job to
show you back into the light Am
I getting through to you

HARKNESS
Ya gonna show me the light
FLAG
Sir
HARKNESS
Scuse me
FLAG

You gonna show me the light sir

HARKNESS
Who the hell is this dingo

Flag steps off and walks the line of prisoners

FLAG
Good news and bad news maggots
Bad news is youre all dead
Sentenced to death row for depraved
criminal acts too vile to mention
Within one year none of you will
be breathing That is a guarantee

Letting this settle in

FLAG (CONTD)
But heres the good news Youre
not dead yet And youve been
selected for a special new program
at Belle Reve Its called field

HARKNESS
Rehabili-what

FLAG
You do one mission for Uncle Sam

commute your sentence

HARKNESS

You mean like we dont die
FLAG

No chances are you still die
(MORE)

( )

FLAG (CONTD)
But this time you do it for your
country

The prisoners exchange baffled glances

FLAG (CONTD)
Translation you are not expected
to survive this mission Those
who do Ooh-rah You just
downgraded to a life sentence

HARKNESS
Hes jokin right

WALLER (0C)
I wish he were Mr Harkness

WALLER comes in from the back of the room

WALLER (CONTD)
Unfortunately we need your help

She strides towards a PROJECTION SCREEN against the wall

WALLER (CONTD)
I see youve already met Captain
Flag He is a decorated combat
veteran-- one of our best We are
lucky to have him Thank you
Captain Ill take it from here

She cycles through images on the screen Brings up a
shot of RUSTAM A security photo taken from the airport

WALLER (CONTD)
Allow me to introduce you to Rustam
He is super-human Type-A Gestures
with his right hand and a flaming
scimitar materializes Cuts through
any metal Very dangerous

Two more images flash up behind her MANTICORE and RAVAN

WALLER (CONTD)
His known associates The one on
the left is Ravan Expert with
knives Big boy is Manticore
Came up out of Latvia

Flashing through old CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS
WALLER (CONTD)
Together they are the last surviving

members of the Onslaught
(MORE )

( )

WALLER (CONTD)

A super-human terrorist cell--
dates back to the Cold War Used
to be they fought the Soviets but
recently thats changed

She flips to a new image

WALLER (CONTD)

48 hours ago they walked into a
military-guarded airport in Eritrea
It took them 5 minutes to do this

SHOTS OF CARNAGE The wreckage of the Gulfstream

WALLER (CONTD)

Our intelligence indicates theyre
preparing an attack on American
soil There was some bad blood in
the spy game and it looks like
theyre settling old scores We
need you to stop it from happening

Lawton finally speaks up --

LAWTON
Why is this our problem

WALLER
You have a concern Mr Lawton

LAWTON
I just thought you people had--
you know people for this kind of

thing

WALLER
Its a bit more complicated than
that

LAWTON

Oh yeah So why go to us
Waller and Flag exchange a look Lawton catches it --
LAWTON (CONTD)
You dont have another choice do

you

WALLER
Mr Lawton you have no idea

Turning to the rest of the group --

( )

WALLER (CONTD)

Your mission is to kill not to
contain I dont need any heroes
out there so you people should
fit in just fine All you have to
do is what you do best

(beat)
Unless anyone has any sort of
conscientious objection

Harkness raises a hand

WALLER (CONTD)
Yes Mr Harkness

HARKNESS
Hey Ms Waller its uh sorry to
bother ya its just I for one

objection youre referrin to
Like maybe I been cured of my
violent nature ya know

Wallers not in the mood for his sarcasm

WALLER

HARKNESS

Whats that
WALLER

Someone who dies in prison because
he isnt willing to cooperate

HARKNESS
Well not when ya put it that way --

WALLER
Get back in line Mr Harkness

And he does Waller turns to the rest of them

WALLER (CONTD)
Let me make one thing abundantly
clear The United States does not
owe you anything We dont owe
you explanations and we certainly
dont owe you the kind of charity
youre being offered right now
So youre welcome Scratch our
back and well scratch yours

She starts to leave with Flag GUARDS move in with cuffs

( )

WALLER (CONTD)

Auditions will be held at 1800

Good luck everyone
A guard clamps Lawtons hands with a long chain We see
he has managed to conceal EXTRA SLACK in his fist Just
a few inches -- but its all he needs
INT BELLE REVE PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY
The PRISONERS are escorted down a long hallway

LAWTON is looking for angles Whispers to HARKNESS --

LAWTON
On my word we go
HARKNESS
Go -- whaddya mean go --

Then they turn the corner and Lawton LEAPS INTO ACTION

Knocking into one of the GUARDS and throwing him sideways
Another draws his PISTOL -- exactly what Lawton was waiting
for He unleashes the chains slack around his neck

using the guard as a hostage while taking his gun and --

SHOOTING a third guard in the hip

LAWTON
Harkness get on it

But Harkness isnt moving In fact none of the prisoners
seem interested in helping out Theyre afraid

And as Lawton realizes hes all alone --

A guard SLAMS HIM in the head

INT BELLE REVE PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

A bruised up LAWTON is dropped in a seat across an aluminum
table The GUARDS leave him as --

RICK FLAG walks in A file under his arm He puts his

What does it get you

LAWTON
Gets me paid doesnt it

FLAG
You ever thought of taking on a
more honorable profession

LAWTON
Honorable Like what killing for
you instead of killing for me

FLAG
For your country Yes

Lawton seems amused by the thought

LAWTON
Let me ask you something-- how
many honorable soldiers know the
names of their victims Cause I
know the name of every asshole I
ever put down

FLAG
That doesnt make you a hero

LAWTON
Right its the bars on your
shoulder-- so what I used to
have a pair myself Maybe some
day theyll even bury me with â€˜em
Put me in that cemetery with those
little flags on top --

( )

FLAG
(too fast)
What makes you think you should be
buried within sight of those men

Lawton knows hes hit a sore spot He grins

LAWTON
I like you Captain

FLAG
Why is that

LAWTON

I dont know maybe its the starch
in your collar-- that brass and
polish routine Or maybe its

just the way you look at a jerk
like me and wanna tear me apart

Lawton leans in for the kill

LAWTON (CONTD)
But Im curious What exactly did
some clean-cut Green Beret have to
do to get stuck with us

FLAG glaring back Theres an answer here but hes not
going to give it up Instead he fights back

FLAG
Plenty of questions I could ask
you too

-epulling out A PHOTO OF ZOE

FLAG (CONTD)
Like what is some low-life hitman
doing with a girl like this

Lawton suddenly goes stone cold Vulnerable

FLAG (CONTD)
Sad story Raised herself Mom
was a call girl-- she never knew
her father And after all these
years watching her from afar how
come you never once worked up the
balls to tell her its you

Lawton dead inside Shutting down

LAWTON
We done here

( )

FLAG
I guess so

Flag stands bangs on the door

FLAG (CONTD)
I should warn you youre on this
team whether you want it or not
Waller says if you dont cooperate
shell go public with your arrest

The guards come in and pick Lawton up Face-to-face
FLAG (CONTD)
Its what youre afraid of isnt
it Having that girl learn what
you really are Shattering any
bullshit illusion that you two
ever had a chance together
Lawton flinching Death in his eyes --
LAWTON
You think you can break me Good
luck
And hes pulled out the door as we

St Louis

An empty fast food establishment No customers no clerks
behind the counter Just ONE MAN eating alone at a table

Well call him COSGROVE (60s) Graying but bullish
Good ol boy He walks with a limp -- a CANE at his side
But who exactly he is will remain a mystery for now

A BODYGUARD opens the door escorting inside --
AN ARMY MAJOR (40s) Dressed in casual blues

MAJOR
They did Theres only one problem

The Major passes across a CLASSIFIED FILE

MAJOR (CONTD)
Its Amanda Waller again

COSGROVE
This lady just doesnt know how to
give it up does she

MAJOR
Well we denied her funds on the
Special Forces request But now
shes found another way to pull a
response team together

Cosgrove reading --

COSGROVE
Criminals

MAJOR
Super-human criminals

He snaps the file shut slides it back dismissively

COSGROVE
I dont need to remind you that we
are not in the business of loose
ends Major

MAJOR
How should we handle it

COSGROVE

Let our boys know theyre coming
They can clean up on their own

( )

The Major nods gets up to leave
COSGROVE (CONTD)

Dreary and snowy outside Two ELDERLY DRUNKS stumble
out Behind them three patrons keep a low profile

RAVAN by the window MANTICORE near the fireplace

And RUSTAM at the bar His eyes are a distant void
Manticore pulls out the STOLEN BRIEFCASE Wires its keypad
to a LAPTOP COMPUTER and boots it up DJINN appears on-
screen He passes through the wire --

AND UNLOCKS THE KEYPAD The briefcase flips open

Rustam comes over sorts through CLASSIFIED FOLDERS
Digs out something important A SCHEDULE

RUSTAM
Here

Djinn appears back on the computer screen smiling eagerly --
DJINN
Therell be hell to pay tomorrow

Ravan and Manticore grin

But Rustam isnt smiling Something is on his mind And
with rising anger he suddenly PICKS UP DJINNS LAPTOP

AND TOSSES IT INTO THE FIREPLACE
We can hear Djinns DIGITAL SCREAM as the flames extinguish

his life Manticore and Ravan dont know how to react
Until Rustam reaches into his coat pocket explaining

( )

RUSTAM
Our contact sent me this It went
out over the American wire

A PHOTOGRAPH The same security camera image that Waller
showed the prisoners And Ravan understands --

RAVAN
The fool He missed a camera

Rustam slams the briefcase Not one to dwell on mistakes

RUSTAM
We go tomorrow

RAVAN
But the Russians will know were
coming Maybe the Americans too --

Blockbuster tries to snap his neck anyway but --

Flag drops her folder in the YES pile

INT BELLE REVE PRISON HANGAR -- LATER
Another cell opens HARKNESS comes out
WALLER
Youve already met Digger Harkness
Expert with throwing weapons On

FLAG
Why do they call him that

A guard removes the METAL BINDINGS from Harknesss hands
He rubs his fingers together and --

( )

PLASMA BOOMERANGS APPEAR He spins them nimbly Ready
for his adversary as another cell opens

AND WE PAN UP ALONG SHAPELY LEGS

WALLER
She was CIA Until she turned and
killed her handler

Off FLAGs look --
Harkness sneers eagerly

HARKNESS
Too bad Throwin in a lamb with
the lions

VIXEN staring back indifferently Her eyes suddenly
reshape into a FELINE SLANT (note her eyes will assume
the form of whatever animal she imitates)

Harkness THROWS a boomerang It spins toward her at
lightning speed but she ducks with cat-like reflexes
It spins around the room -- almost hitting FLAG -- then
lands back in Harknesss hands

He THROWS it again This time Vixen LEAPS THROUGH THE
AIR her throat emitting a TIGERS GROWL as --

HER FINGERNAILS TURN TO TIGERS CLAWS

Slicing the boomerang mid-air landing and rolling into
Harkness with lightning speed CLAWS AT HIS THROAT

HARKNESS (CONTD)
Groovy

She starts to return to her cage when Harkness quickly
SLICES a boomerang against her ankle

She pauses irritated Harkness grins

WALLER
(knowing whats coming)
Oops

She KICKS HIM in the face and begins pummeling him

FLAG
You think we should

Harkness tries to crawl free helpless --

HARKNESS
Okay Im tappin out

Until Vixen finally settles down Sits in her cage

FLAG
Can she be controlled

WALLER
To be honest shes the only one I
have any hope for She swears her
crime was justified and she wants
to earn a second chance

Justified

Seven doors open and SEVEN PRISONERS step on the line
They will be our newly-formed team To summarize

BLOCKBUSTER -- the strongman
MULTIPLEX -- the human replicator
JACULI -- the speedster
MINDBOGGLER -- the female telepath

Its a lot of names But dont worry -- our story is not
going to feature them Instead we will emphasize

HARKNESS -- special weapons
VIXEN -- female with animal abilities
And LAWTON -- you know what he does

These are the three who should always be featured

FLAG and a few armed guards pace past them

Welcome to the team deadbeats

If I can just say I for one am
honored and humbled --

ON THE PROJECTION SCREEN a file photo of the Russian
courier with the BRIEFCASE attached to his wrist

WALLER
This briefcase contained a shipping
schedule for a very classified
Russian weapon Every few months
they transfer this weapon on a
high-speed train to keep its
location secret We believe the
Onslaught intends to steal it

Schematics of a HIGH-SPEED TRAIN flash up behind her
HARKNESS
What kind of weapon we talkin

about Like some kind a nuke

WALLER
That is above your pay grade

Now hold on a second we deserve
to know --
WALLER

No you dont deserve anything Mr
Lawton Youre here to terminate
your targets That is all

Yeah One more thing Everyone
look down at your left forearm

LAWTON observes the SCAR along the inside of his wrist

While you were sleeping the other
night we took the liberty of
inserting a fail-safe It isa
PED-- a personal explosive device
If any of you get any ideas on
this mission-- like giving me an
untimely death or running more
than two hundred yards away from
me this device can automatically
detonate an ounce of C4 surgically-
implanted inside of you

Flag lifts up his WRIST WATCH -- an automated detonator

FLAG (CONTD)
Or you know I can just detonate
it myself Either way take my
word for it there would be little
of you left to clean up

glares at Flag sizing up his adversary

over to JACULI (Middle Eastern speedster) next to him

LAWTON
Id love to know what our Captain
has up his ass

Jaculi doesnt respond MINDBOGGLER answers instead --

MINDBOGGLER
Way I heard it he was some Green
Beret hot shot Screwed up on a
mission and got himself deep-sixed

LAWTON
Really

MINDBOGGLER
Guess hes the best Waller could
do on short notice

LAWTON
(shaking his head)
One hell of a mission we got

Lawton turns back to Jaculi Hes got a persistent twitch --
his body blurring in fast motion -- but other than that
he sits steadfast Closed off to the others

All right children suit up Were
two miles from our destination

The various restraints lift off the prisoners They flex
begin to rise Pulling out of their duffel bags

INDIVIDUAL EQUIPMENT Each suit of armor is customized
for the varying abilities of each prisoner For example

BLOCKBUSTER has heavy duty kevlar armor that only he could
manage to wield

MINDBOGGLERS helmet has a plate that allows her to spread
her mind-waves at greater radius (more on this below)

LAWTONs armor is equipped with his personal wrist-mounted
pistol rig and plenty of ammunition

FLAG (CONTD)
Heres how we do it Once we get
on the train I want two teams
All radio frequency is blocked
inside so Mindboggler youre
gonna be our com system Can you
get in our heads

but they are collateral Not on

casualties is that clear

Behind them Harkness lifts another piece of gear out of
his bag A PARACHUTE

Uh whaddya expect us to do with
these by chance

Flag responds by SLAMMING a button that causes the SS-1s
tailgate to --

engage
EXT RUSSIAN AIRSPACE -- NIGHT

Like FLAG needed permission Hes already on defense

LAWTON twists his body and narrowly avoids one drone

A shot from another drone soars past MULTIPLEX and grazes
BLOCKBUSTERs armor The big man grunts indifferently
Waits for the craft to fly by and --

SMASHES OFF THE WING

The drone spirals dead into the clouds One down

JACULI sees hes got another drone on his tail He sways
to avoid the path of its bullets His body is a BLUR in
the clouds A work of art But he cant lose the craft
So he does the next best thing Sees HARKNESS nearby
Cuts left and crosses paths with him flashing a grin as
he moves off and now --

THE DRONE IS LOCKED IN ON HARKNESS

Who gasps incredulously Not nearly as fast The drone
switches to missiles FIRES

Harkness does what Harkness does best From his hands
two PLASMA BOOMERANGS appear He tosses them towards the
missile their paths arcing and slicing and --

Triggering a THUNDERING EXPLOSION

But the drone persists flying through the fire Harkness
appears to be out of luck until --

VIXEN cuts in landing on the back of the drone and ripping
out its circuit board The drone spins in circles short-
circuited and losing control Its guns fire blindly and --
HIT THE THIRD DRONE

Which explodes in the sky right next to LAWTON Two down

Vixen quickly cuts the remainder of the cords and causes
her drone to power down It plummets out of the sky

And that makes three

Theyre here --

Manticore grabs the rifle out of the soldiers hands and
swats him down with it The others OPEN FIRE but he
just takes the bullets Nothing seems to harm him

He points towards it indicating thats where theyre
headed But LAWTON points towards something else

A TUNNEL which the train is about to head into

Time is short Flag cuts his path to dive faster Lawton
and the others follow

RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE TRAIN
At minimum altitude their parachutes AUTOMATICALLY DEPLOY

Flag buys himself a soft landing and SLIDES ACROSS THE

-- feet on the verge of hitting the train --

Suddenly BLOCKBUSTER lurches forward Without warning --
without another word -- he grabs Multiplex by the collar
lifting him with a surge of strength and --
TOSSING HIS BODY OUT THE OPEN WINDOW

So fast that no one could do a thing to stop it Flag
LAWTON everyones stunned So much for Multiplex

With his other hand he lifts up the PED watch to show him --

The soldier goes down But thats not all The ROUND
passes through his leg now significantly damaged but

still moving It ricochets off the wall behind him losing
velocity until --

LAWTON FIRES ANOTHER BULLET

Changing the rounds path -- diverting it into the arm of
the second soldier who goes down

We SLAM BACK to real time --
ON THE BODIES writhing on the floor disarmed
Flag looks at Lawton deadpan

LAWTON (CONTD)
What It was his bullet

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN SHIPPING CONTAINER -- NIGHT

A vacuum-sealed door rolls open The inside of this
container is freezing cold Kept at an absurdly low
temperature for reasons were about to understand

As RUSTAM enters Shines a light around What could be
inside A chemical weapon A bomb An EMP Or

A FRAIL OLD MAN
A prisoner Wrinkles cutting through his face like scars
Not shivering In fact flakes of ice MELT as soon as

they hit his shoulders -- because he emits an ENERGY FIELD

His name is FALLOUT (60s) And believe me you dont
want to see what he can do Pale eyes rising

FALLOUT
My son

Rustam extends a hand They share a powerful embrace

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN LOWER ENGINE ROOM -- NIGHT

Catwalks over pipes and hydraulics HARKNESS VIXEN and
MINDBOGGLER walk in

MINDBOGGLER

FLAG
Keep your eyes peeled-- weve got
plenty of secondaries up here
INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN LOWER ENGINE ROOM -- NIGHT
HARKNESS walking with VIXEN

HARKNESS
Aint much of a talker are ya

VIXEN
What is there to talk about

HARKNESS

Oh I get it Youre too good for
the rest of us Vixen

( )

VIXEN
I dont even belong in the same
category

She suddenly kneels to the ground EYES shaping like a
WOLFs as she sniffs the air

VIXEN (CONTD)
Theres something up ahead

Creeping around the corner to --
TWO DEAD RUSSIAN MECHANICS Knives in their backs
HER EARS PERK UP

She points MINDBOGGLER and Harkness in two directions
They follow a noise that grows louder

TO RAVAN wiring more C4 CHARGES into the gears

Harkness reaches for his boomerangs making the slightest
of noises

And Ravan hears him

Without even thinking he TOSSES a knife behind him
Harkness cuts it mid-air Ravan spins and responds with
another knife but this one --

VIXEN catches mid-air snapping it in two

Ravan sprints for the exit

-- just as Harkness moves in --

Ravan ducks down drawing a knife and sliding towards him --
-- and they engage in single combat --

Harkness parrying with serrated boomerangs Ravan with

two fast-moving switchblades In the end Ravan is faster
shoving Harkness to the ground foot planted on his chest
and about to bring down his blade when --

A SCREAMING NOISE

Fills Ravans head He stumbles back

MINDBOGGLER comes at him with her telepathy in full effect
His vision BLURS shapes rack out of focus Hallucinating

He has no other choice but to --

STAB A KNIFE INTO A NEARBY PISTON

( )

Causing a burst of steam that momentarily blinds everyone
and when it clears RAVAN IS GONE

HARKNESS
Ya know its an insult to steal a
mans kill right

MINDBOGGLER
I certainly didnt mean to draw
your manhood into question

Harkness glares at her as she pushes past

Vixen kneels before the C4 charge and RIPS THE LINE

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN CARGO BAY -- NIGHT

LAWTON and FLAG enter guns drawn JACULI and BLOCKBUSTER
are close behind They step over dead bodies Staring

at the gaping mouth of --

THE SHIPPING CONTAINER marked Hazardous Now empty

LAWTON
That cant be good

Flag looks around No sign of Rustam But then he notices
someone else on the far end of the car

MANTICORE Hes waiting for them

Flag and Lawton OPEN FIRE but the bullets simply bounce
off Manticores tough exterior

BLOCKBUSTER
My turn

BLOCKBUSTER pushes past them charging Manticore and --
ENGAGING IN A BRUTAL FIGHT Muscle on muscle They toss
each other from one side of the car to the other knocking
into storage lockers blowing equipment loose

Flag seeing where this is going

FLAG
Wait dont let him --

-as Manticore grips Blockbuster by the shoulders --

AND THEY BOTH GO THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE TRAIN

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS -- NIGHT

LANDING IN THE SNOW

Somersaulting and smashing into the side of a rock The
train barrels away from them Anyone else this fall

would have killed them but these two are not mere mortals

They rise to face each other unscathed

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN CARGO BAY -- NIGHT
except FLAG knows something else is about to happen

The PROXIMITY ALERT flares up on his watch

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS -- NIGHT

BLOCKBUSTER begins to feel a trembling from the PED in
his arm Grasps it

-- and without warning --

HE EXPLODES and rocks Manticore to his back Little of
Blockbuster left to clean up

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN CARGO BAY -- NIGHT

FLAG grimacing at the flat-line Two down

LAWTON moves to the rear door Its LOCKED And thats
when he sees through the portal window --

THE FACE OF RUSTAM Staring back

A moment of eye contact An indifferent haunting glare
Chilling even a criminal like Lawton to his bone

Flag draws his pistol and aims at the hinges --

FLAG
Stand back --

When suddenly HIS LEGS ARE KNOCKED OUT FROM UNDER HIM
Flag hits the ground Lawton spins and draws a gun but
a LIGHTNING-FAST BLUR comes past him and throws him into

the wall Lawton looks up to see --

JACULI

( )

Standing over both men with his PISTOL pointed The very
same pistol that Lawton gave him

FLAG (CONTD)
The hell do you think youre doing

Jaculi looks through the portal window at Rustam Nods
knowingly A silent signal As Lawton realizes --

LAWTON
Hes working with them Flag Who
did your background checks

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN REAR CAR -- NIGHT

RUSTAM leads FALLOUT away from the locked door They are
joined by RAVAN climbing up the stairs from below

RAVAN
Were sealed off But Rustam
they pulled the detonators

Rustam glares at him Not pleased with failure

Just then Fallout limps towards an open hydraulic panel
Kneels before it Staring at the parts inside

FALLOUT
Allow me

AND HIS BODY BEGINS TO GLOW
-- radiation leaking from his fingertips --

PLUTONIUM to be exact

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN ALL CARS -- NIGHT

which runs through the gears of the train guided as
if by an invisible hand --

BLOWING UP one braking mechanism at a time

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN REAR CAR -- NIGHT

RUSTAM pulls an emergency lever slowing down their wheels --

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS -- NIGHT

AND RIPPING THE REAR CAR FROM THE REST OF THE TRAIN

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN CARGO BAY -- NIGHT
The train SHAKES violently Theyre accelerating now

FLAG tries to manually trigger his PED watch but JACULI
steps on his hand sneering --

JACULI
There is no hope for you You
cannot stop what is about to pass --

LAWTON
Hey Twitchy How bout you stop
talking and get it over with
He turns to LAWTON
LAWTON (CONTD)
I gave you the gun-- so I deserve

the first bullet dont I Just
pull the damn trigger already

Jaculi doesnt hesitate Squeezes the trigger and
CLICK Nothing The clip was empty
Thats when Lawton grins
LAWTON (CONTD)
News flash There is no Bedouin

camp in Dakhar

And with that he raises his own guns and PLUGS JACULI
TWICE in the chest with live rounds

Flag rises incredulous Off his look --

LAWTON (CONTD)
He was too calm I had an inkling

FLAG
An inkling

LAWTON
Flag this is what I do okay
Theyre villains Villains cheat

Flag looks out the portal window Sees that they are
completely detached from Rustams car

FLAG
Mindboggler you copy

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN LOWER ENGINE ROOM -- NIGHT
HARKNESS VIXEN and MINDBOGGLER amidst the chaos

MINDBOGGLER
Flag Come again

Over her shoulder we see a RUSSIAN SOLDIER creeping
towards her pistol drawn She doesnt notice

But HARKNESS does At first he goes for his boomerang

And then he reconsiders

Allowing the soldier to move in --

AND SHOOT MINDBOGGLER IN THE BACK

VIXEN is immediately upon the soldier tossing him into a
wall with ferocious force She goes to Mindboggler but
the bullet is in her heart All she can do is watch as
the girls breathing goes heavy and then

-STILL Shes dead

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN CARGO BAY -- NIGHT
FLAG trying to listen but nothing comes back

FLAG
Mindboggler

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN LOWER ENGINE ROOM -- NIGHT
HARKNESS completely unrepentant --

HARKNESS
Senseless waste a human life

VIXENs hands wrap around Harknesss neck as her eyes
grow into the shape of a BEARS black pupils

VIXEN
I could snap your neck with such
incredible strength right now

HARKNESS
But ya wont cause you aint
like us right

Vixen glaring Releasing him
INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN CARGO BAY -- NIGHT
FLAG trying to listen for Mindboggler

LAWTON
Forget it Flag the missions blown

LAWTON fumbles through a storage locker tossing away
useless gear and digging up C4 CHARGES He plugs them
with a detonator and places them around the rear door

FLAG
What do you think youre doing

LAWTON
Im getting us out of here Watch
your ears

He unwinds the cord stepping back and --

BOOM The detonation RIPS OFF the back wall of the train

WIND howls through

FLAG
Damnit Lawton stand down

LAWTON
You had your chance Its my turn

FLAG
That is not how this works --

LAWTON
Flag we keep bickering and this
mission is gonna turn out just
like your last one

FLAG frozen Vulnerable
LAWTON (CONTD)
Yeah We all heard So howd you

screw up that time --

Flag suddenly COLD-COCKS him in the face

Pummeling him with shot after shot His cool discipline
has gone out the window This is raw unbridled rage

and he has no problem overpowering Lawton with it

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS -- NIGHT

The train screams towards a curve Time is running out

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN REAR CAR -- NIGHT
FLAG continues smashing down on LAWTON when --

VIXEN violently restrains him from behind HARKNESS is
standing just a little ways off

HARKNESS

Lawton rises shoving past Flag and tearing out an EXTRA
PARACHUTE from his gear bag

LAWTON

He moves to the hole Vixen sees what hes doing grabs
a length of cord and wraps it around all of them They
gather into a pack

On the floor JACULI moans Hes alive

FLAG
Stop Were bringing him

LAWTON
We dont have room --

FLAG

Lawton glares but allows for Flag to haul him in

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS -- NIGHT

The train hits the curve and begins to DERAIL creating
an awesome accordion effect that rips apart its body

INT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN REAR CAR -- NIGHT

LAWTON deploys the chute outside the gaping hole the
wind catching it and --

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS -- NIGHT

YANKING THE TEAM IN THE AIR

Just as their car flies off the rails and slams violently
into a CLIFF WALL An EXPLOSION of steel debris

The wind dies down and they LAND hard sliding through
the snow in a rough pile Survivors Barely

( )

The group gathers itself coughing up snow What was
once a team of eight has now been reduced to four plus
one back-stabbing prisoner
HARKNESS
Well that seemed to a worked out
fine for everyone now didnt it

Flag looking around --

FLAG
Dont be so sure

LIGHTS APPEAR The rising sound of ENGINES
A RUSSIAN TANK CAVALRY

Emerges from the darkness weapons trained down on them
Surrounding the team Hundreds of them No chance

LAWTON frustrated In even deeper than he thought

INT BELLE REVE PRISON COMMAND HQ -- DAY

Back in the main control room utter silence WALLER is

COMMANDANT

LAWTON FLAG
No Temporarily
COMMANDANT
Well which is it No or

temporarily
Lawton sighs frustrated --

LAWTON
Whatever he says

( )

The Commandant begins rifling through a desk drawer

COMMANDANT
Foreign intelligence has found
many interesting morsels about
your little group of friends
(to Flag)
You are American yes

FLAG
Yes

He slaps down a FOLDER

COMMANDANT
Rick Flag Green Beret In the
last few years stationed at how
do you say Fort Leavenworth

FLAG
Thats right

Lawton clocks something More on this later The
Commandant shifts his attention

COMMANDANT
And you You are not American
military You are

LAWTON
Not supposed to be here Bingo

The Commandant pulls out an ENORMOUS FILE and slams it
down on the table Practically an Encyclopedia

COMMANDANT
No You are the great Deadshot

Lawton hesitates Not sure how this will be received
until the Commandant breaks into a WIDE GRIN

COMMANDANT (CONTD)
I may shake your hand yes At
first I cannot believe When they
send your file I say no it is
not possible Of all prisons for
you to come here The Man Who
Never Misses

He pulls out a BINDER filled with newspaper clippings

Flag gestures to the wall where we now see --
A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH Depicting the Commandant with this

LAWTON (CONTD)
Oh Shit

The Commandants smile fades

COMMANDANT

FLAG
Listen This is a misunderstanding

Waller --

( )

The Commandant ignores him brutally grabbing Lawton and --
SLAMMING HIS FACE DOWN ON THE DESK

Lawton drops to the ground with the chair still attached
to him Desk ornaments fall around him A stapler the
porcelain pen holder various paperweights

COMMANDANT
I am very honored to have you here

COMMANDANT

FLAG

COMMANDANT
(enraged)
Superiors These men who relegate

never place me here He is good

and honorable man But General

Orlovsky is dead Because of you

And now you are stuck with me

The Commandant kicks him again and steps back
COMMANDANT

cold

Vixen averts her eyes

Just then LAWTON and FLAG are thrown into the cell

( )

LAWTON
You know that Commandants a really
nice guy
FLAG

Enough of this shit

Flag heads over to the dying JACULI yanking him up and
barking into his face --

FLAG (CONTD)
Who is your source

Jaculi coughs up blood laughs

JACULI
I have done my service to my
brothers I will see them again
in Paradise --

FLAG
I dont give a shit where youre
going Someone transferred you to
Belle Reve now I want to know who
it was

LAWTON
Flag give it up would you

Flag rises face-to-face with Lawton

FLAG
Okay Lawton I understand your
little world view of self-
preservation may have gotten you
this far but I am still the ranking
officer on this mission --

LAWTON
I dont give a damn about your
mission didnt I make that clear

FLAG
Abundantly Thanks

LAWTON
You know what your problem is
Youre too soft You gotta lose
the polish Bend the rules a
little Like this

Lawton kneels beside Jaculi and SHOVES A FINGER INTO HIS
BULLET WOUND

LAWTON (CONTD)
How did you get in this crew

( )

Jaculi screams out in horrific pain

HARKNESS
Ah Good cop bad cop Now theyre
gettin somewhere

But instead of caving Jaculi begins to LAUGH

JACULI
There is nothing you can do My
mission is complete Fallouts
vengeance will be swift and certain --

LAWTON
What the hell is a Fallout

FLAG
Who

Lawton looks at Flag curious --

FLAG (CONTD)
Hes aman Hes the reason they
were on the train tonight Fallout
used to be their leader but hes
been in Russian custody the last
fifteen years

JACULI
It was your CIA who sold him out

Jaculi sits up glaring as he speaks

JACULI (CONTD)
We were once errand boys just
like you When Russia was our
common enemy the CIA gave us
training intelligence everything
we needed Then their war ended
and we were taken out to rot
The United States wanted us to
disappear They helped the Russian
bastards hunt us Slaughtered our
brothers where they slept

(beat)

Their reckoning is fast upon them

Lawton starts to put it together Looks at Flag
LAWTON
Let me guess Fallout was the

weapon on board that train

FLAG
Yes

( )

LAWTON
And what exactly does he do

FLAG
Hes a human nuclear bomb

Silence falls over the cell

LAWTON
Beautiful

FLAG
It was need-to-know --

LAWTON
You know whats also need-to-know-
right now What an asshole you
are These guys are stealing a
walking nuke and you recruited us
to save the day

FLAG
Waller didnt have a choice
Someone inside the Pentagon was
backing them up They cut off her
funding She was in a corner --

LAWTON
Well that is just great

Jaculi coughs violently on the floor Hes starting to
bleed out It wont be long now Flag grabs him

FLAG
Where are they going to strike

JACULI
Its too late

LAWTON
Flag youre wasting your time

FLAG
Damnit Lawton shut up --

VIXEN (0C)
ENOUGH

Everyone shocked turns to Vixen

VIXEN (CONTD)
The two of you deserve each other
do you know that Do you hear
how ridiculous you sound

(MORE )

( )

VIXEN (CONTD)
All you do is argue and fight when
there are lives at stake Cant
you see whats on the verge of
happening

She drops next to the fading Jaculi and presses her hands
against his wound Her eyes now turn REPTILIAN

VIXEN (CONTD)
Where I come from we have a viper
with a poison so potent it can
render its victim inert In this
state they say the victim will
answer any question you ask

HER FINGERTIPS OOZING SLIGHTLY

Passing off a liquid VENOM through Jaculis wound into
his body His face turns MILKY WHITE

VIXEN (CONTD)
So where are they going to be

Jaculis body is stark still Hes moments from dying
But his lips are able to form one final word

JACULI
Boston

LAWTON reacting to this FLAG knowing why

FLAG
Lawton wait --

He grabs Jaculi desperately

LAWTON
What did you say

Jaculi is gone

LAWTON his face falling The gravity of this situation
finally becoming real for him

Vixen shoots daggers at Flag

VIXEN
If this happens its our fault

Flag shaking his head as we CUT TO --

He looks up and for just a moment he sees that LITTLE
GIRL going down the slide again Like a memory he just
cant shake He blinks and shes gone

FLAG sits down next to him

( )

FLAG

LAWTON
Just thinking about her mother
Hadnt thought about her in years

because I thought I knew what was
right But I wasnt Ive been
paying for that mistake ever since

LAWTON
You really screwed up huh

For Flag this is an understatement Its a pain he wears

LAWTON (CONTD)
Waller promised your stars back if
you did this mission

FLAG
Yeah

LAWTON
Well Flag take it from me Youre
gonna be paying off those mistakes
for the rest of your life

Flag cast-iron Finally after a long silence he reaches
into his pocket

FLAG
You know its not so bad here

LAWTON
Yeah well get used to it --

FLAG
No Youre not hearing me

Takes his hand out to reveal hes holding a FOUNTAIN PEN
Its the Commandants -- Flag swiped it from the office
when Lawton was being beaten

FLAG (CONTD)
This place Its not so bad

LAWTON a glimmer of curiosity

FLAG (CONTD)
See over the last few years Ive

( )

FLAG (CONTD)
But once you do it long enough
you start to realize whats the
point We are who we are

LAWTON

placed on it

HARKNESS
I dont spose ya could cut the

Cold stare from the COOK
He brings his tray to a table alone With his iron gloves

RAVAN grabs her by the throat Holding her under him
Savoring this last moment before the kill --

UNTIL A RINGING NOISE ABOVE
And he looks up to see --
THE BELL PLUNGING TOWARDS HIM
-- landing on the platform --
AND CRUSHING HIM IMMEDIATELY
Vixen falls backwards smacking down on the landing just
below where the bell hit Having no idea what just
happened until she sees --
HARKNESS climbing down Hed cut the bell from above
HARKNESS
Bet ya never thought youd be glad
to see me huh

VIXEN staring at him in wonder

then noticing the platform above is beginning to
SPLINTER under the bells weight

VIXEN
Harkness youre still a fool

( )

Harkness realizes it too Hauling her up as they both
TUMBLE DOWN THE STAIRS

WITH THE GIANT BELL FALLING DOWN ON TOP OF THEM

-- hitting every joist and beam on the way down --

-- but getting closer and closer --

-- as Harkness and Vixen finally reach the bottom and --
DIVE OUT OF THE WAY

The bell SMASHES DOWN to ground level behind them And
only now do they heave a mutual sigh of relief For the
first time Harkness is speechless

EXT NORTH CHURCH REAR ENTRANCE -- DAY

LAWTON bursts through the back door just in time to see
MANTICORE stuffing ZOE into the back of the armored truck

HE FIRES AT MANTICORES HEAD

But the strongman hardly notices Instead he reaches
for a nearby DUMPSTER

-- PICKING IT UP --

And tossing it across the alley towards where Lawton is
standing Lawton dives sideways and the dumpster SMASHES
the wall behind him dropping just inches from his head
He rears back and fires more shots Its no use

His arm pistols are out of ammo

MANTICORE smiling Moving in

Lawton reaching to his holster and pulling out one last
gun A small 9mm A pea shooter But its empty

He reaches for another clip Finds nothing
HIS GEAR CLIP

Fell to the other side of the alley All hes got within
quick reach is ONE ROUND which clattered to the ground

-- Manticore getting closer --
-- Lawtons hands fumbling with the round --
-- dropping it --

-- Manticore almost upon him now --

( )

-- picking it back up and jamming it into the chamber --
-- just as Manticore lifts him up --

-- and Lawton raises the 9mm --

SHOVING IT INTO MANTICORES MOUTH

The strongman freezes Suddenly on alert Which makes
Lawton realize

LAWTON
Soft on the inside huh

The bullet PLUNGES through the roof of Manticores mouth
and into his brain --

KILLING HIM The strongman hits the ground

Lawton catching his breath looks up towards the armored
truck Begins limping for the door when suddenly --

THE TRUCK STARTS UP AND SPEEDS OFF

RUSTAM is in the drivers seat Hes making a getaway
Lawton begins to run after the truck

FLAG emerges from the door next to him grabs his arm --

LAWTON (CONTD)
Hes got her in there

FLAG
Wait-- we have to stay together

LAWTON
Then you better keep up

He sprints around the corner --

EXT BOSTON NORTH END -- DAY
RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PARADE

into a float and exiting the other side

VIXEN with him

HARKNESS

WALLER

HARKNESS
Well ya see I think Lawtons gone
a little rogue

EXT 93 HIGHWAY -- DAY

LAWTON on the motorcycle eyes on fire A series of hot
dog maneuvers the likes of which no sane person should
ever do But hes hell-bent right now

Cutting between cars sharp turns finally reaching the
side of the ARMORED TRUCK --

-- just as RUSTAM notices him --

-- pulling the wheel to the right --

-- pushing Lawtons motorcycle against the median --

-- a tunnel wall approaching --

SO LAWTON LEAPS ONTO THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK

The motorcycle SMASHES into a thousand pieces

THE MINI-VAN swerves to avoid this A tire hits one of

the lose parts of the debris almost burning off its tread
Its hanging on by a narrow margin

FLAG gets up on the armored trucks ass

INT MINI-VAN MOVING -- DAY
HARKNESS sees this --

HARKNESS
Flag back off

FLAG
Im trying to catch him if he falls

( )

HARKNESS
Youre gonna run â€˜im over if he
falls

LAWTON pulls himself onto the roof trying to hold on
Turns back to see Flags MINI-VAN behind him

Speaking into the com-link --
LAWTON
Im out of ammo
INT MINI-VAN MOVING -- DAY
FLAG tosses a few clips into the back seat
FLAG
Harkness would you do something

useful

HARKNESS OPENS THE SUN-ROOF and rises out the top

EXT 93 HIGHWAY -- DAY
TOSSING THE CLIPS

With expert precision into LAWTONs hands The kind of
throw only HARKNESS could make

Lawton slams the clips into his wrist-mounted pistols
pulling himself over the cab of the truck and --

FIRING DOWN But the bullets bounce off the thick hood

INT ARMORED TRUCK MOVING -- DAY

RUSTAM looks up realizes hes still got Lawton above
him Swerves more to flip him off

Its no use So he tries the next option --

EXT 93 HIGHWAY -- DAY
LAWTON realizing what that option is --

AS THE SCIMITAR SLICES THROUGH THE ROOF

He rolls to avoid it nearly falling off the side He
routes his momentum backwards --

( )

ROLLING BACK ALONG THE ROOF

-- about to tumble off the edge --

WHEN HE GRABS THE REAR OF THE TRUCK

His feet dangling just inches from FLAGs mini-van He
kicks at the trucks backdoor His fingers are slipping
Losing their grip fast Keeps kicking until --

ZOE OPENS IT

Just as Lawton flips into the back

INT ARMORED TRUCK MOVING -- DAY

LAWTON and ZOE together at last Sort of

ZOE
Floyd

LAWTON
You okay

ZOE

Is it true-- what he said
LAWTON looking back at her having no idea how he would
ever answer this question
EXT 93 HIGHWAY -- DAY

The MINI-VANs front tread now FALLS OFF ENTIRELY

INT MINI-VAN MOVING -- DAY

FLAG feeling it in the steering Knowing time is short
into the com-link --

FLAG
Lawton I cant keep up If youre
going to make a move do it

INT ARMORED TRUCK MOVING -- DAY

LAWTON is locked on ZOE Making up his mind A life of
mistakes -- and one shot at redemption

LAWTON
Im really sorry Zoe

With that he tosses her out the back of the truck --

( )

-- screaming as she soars through the air --
LANDING IN HARKNESSS ARMS

And he drags her back in through the sun-roof
FLAG has to swerve to keep on track

FLAG
Get on

LAWTON
Sorry Flag-- if I cant live like
a hero I might as well die like
one

He lifts his wrist Indicating the PED

INT MINI-VAN MOVING -- DAY
FLAG realizing what hes talking about
FLAG
I am not letting you do that
That is an order

INT ARMORED TRUCK MOVING -- DAY

But LAWTON is not negotiating here FLAG can tell by the
look in his eyes So Flag does the next best thing

Using all he has left on the accelerator and --

EXT 93 HIGHWAY -- DAY
RAMMING THE ARMORED TRUCK FROM BEHIND

Causing RUSTAM to lose control of the wheel just as they
hit a turn --

AND FLIP OFF THE SHOULDER

-- cart-wheeling through the air --

-- LAWTON inside holding on for dear life --
-- rolling down the embankment --

-- towards the Charles River --

-- landing hard on the edge --

The truck finally sliding to a stop

( )

FLAG stops the mini-van on the shoulder above

ZOE pushes out the door running to the edge looking
down at the CRUMBLED REMAINS OF THE ARMORED TRUCK

RUSTAM bloodied crawls out from the front seat
And LAWTON limps out Standing over him Gun poised

Rustam draws his SCIMITAR Waiting Fearless One of
them is going to have to make a move

But Lawton HESITATES Because he sees ZOE on the shoulder
Staring at this man with a gun The killer within him
The one thing Lawton never wanted his daughter to see
And Rustam understands
RUSTAM
Its what youre afraid of isnt

it Knowing youre just like me

Lawton doesnt know what to do For the first time the
Man Who Never Misses doesnt want to shoot

-- until --
A BULLET HITS RUSTAM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES
Lawton turns to FLAG holding the smoking pistol

RUSTAM goes still The scimitar disappears from his
fingertips Hes dead

Lawton to Flag For the first time gratitude --

LAWTON
Thank you

In the distance SIRENS are rising HARKNESS leans out
from the car

HARKNESS
I really hate to bother everyone
but I dont think the law is too
fond of us right now

Flag heads towards a nearby tunnel Harkness gathers
VIXEN from the back of the car

Lawton stops before Zoe

LAWTON
Zoe I

She takes his hand

( )

ZOE
I would have understood

SIRENS RISING Flag looking back at them --

FLAG
Im sorry but we have to go

LAWTON
(to Zoe)
Are you good

ZOE
Not really no But I will be

LAWTON
Im gonna come back Zoe

ZOE
When

LAWTON so many things he wishes he could say -- or that
he should have said -- but

LAWTON
I dont know

Zoe stares at him Despite her hurt theres a hint of
understanding as she says

ZOE
Ill see you around Floyd

And then hes gone Running with the rest of his team
into a nearby tunnel just as POLICE CARS begin to approach
in the distance

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BELLE REVE PRISON -- DAY

The high-tech prison in the middle of the Bayou Seen
for the first time on a good day

INT BELLE REVE PRISON COMMAND HQ -- DAY

ON TV footage of SENATOR COSGROVE in a wheelchair now
speaking to reporters at a press conference

COSGROVE (on TV)
It is because of this eye-opening
near-tragedy in Boston last week
that I am hereby resigning my
(MORE )

( )

COSGROVE (on TV) (CONTD)
campaign to focus on my duties as
Head of the Armed Services
Committee I think we all know
how close we came last week And
we have our unnamed heroes in the
Armed Services to thank

WALLER grins turns off the TV
FLAG is packing away gear behind her

FLAG
Was that your doing

WALLER
I gave him a choice Step off his
campaign or the press receives one
hell of a de-classified document

FLAG
Why not just take him down

WALLER
Because you never know when its
good to have a Senator in your
pocket

They start to walk out through the corridors

WALLER (CONTD)
My report went to Leavenworth
(handing him an envelope)
Congratulations Captain You
have your stars back

Flag opens the envelope pulls out a BRONZE STAR and a
letter of commendation Letting it settle in

Meanwhile they pass the MEDLAB -- where VIXEN and HARKNESS
are being treated for wounds

HARKNESS
I keep tellin ya I got nothin
wrong with me except for this
damned bomb ya bastards put in me
heart Why dont we get movin on
curing that huh

He sees Waller and presses his face against the glass --
HARKNESS (CONTD)

Hey Waller I thought we had a
deal

( )

FLAG
Youre not taking it out

WALLER
No Ive got future plans for him

She looks to Flag

WALLER (CONTD)
What about you Are you going to
get your command back

Flag looks down at the letter staring long and hard

FLAG
Actually I figure maybe Im
not quite cut out for this kind of
command anymore

WALLER
Is that so

FLAG
Like maybe Id be better off doing
something I dont know less
conventional maybe

WALLER

Funny you should mention that
because this Cosgrove thing had me
wondering what kind of recourse
wed have against the hostile
elements within our own ranks

(beat)
We could use a team that knew how
to work off-grid

Flag regards Harkness through the glass

FLAG
Its gonna take a hell of a deal
to get them working again

WALLER
I suppose we could start by offering
them years off their sentences
(beat)
But what could I offer you Captain

Flag thinking about this for a moment

FLAG

criminal but Im not a fool

They push through another set of gates into --
EXT BELLE REVE PRISON -- DAY

The main courtyard where a PRISONER BUS is waiting
escort is the SERGEANT from the beginning

LAWTON
Gotta say after all I did for
this country the least they could
do is give me a trial or something
You do realize I wasnt even charged
for a crime right

FLAG
Guess youll have to settle for a
transfer instead

LAWTON regards the bus FLAG hands him a duffel bag

FLAG (CONTD)
Good-bye gift Open it on board

Lawton nods grateful

LAWTON
Thanks

FLAG
You too
(beat)
So if you ever find your way out
you think youre going to look her
up someday

LAWTON
Maybe When Im ready

He turns to leave

FLAG
Lawton

He stops Turns back around

FLAG (CONTD)
You dont have to be proud of what
you are But you dont have to
ashamed of it either

They make eye contact and grin One last moment of
understanding Then Lawton boards the bus

FLAG watching out the window as

EXT LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAY

the injured SERGEANT shot in the foot

Looking back gratefully towards Belle Reve
INT BELLE REVE PRISON PRIVATE QUARTERS -- DAY
FLAG turning away grins to himself
FLAG
Good luck Lawton
EXT LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAY

And LAWTON saunters into the warm heat of the Bayou
Like Flag hes finally accepted himself for what he is

A criminal bastard Flawed as hell But capable of good
And maybe thatll be good enough for now
FADE TO BLACK

THE END
