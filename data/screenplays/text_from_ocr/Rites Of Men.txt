looking considerably younger than his 16 years

Rett comes through the door drops the box on Billy’s lap

Billy smiles shyly starts opening it slowly carefully not
ripping any of the paper because he’s that type of kid

Rett is cruising through town along El Camino Real and pulls
up in front of a hardware store

He hops out and notices something across the street in
front of a COFFEE SHOP

It’s BILLY in the midst of a heated discussion with a tall
raven-haired Goth-looking GIRL 17ish

Rett raises his hand is about to call out to him but then
decides against it He’d rather just watch

RETT
(to himself)
Say Billy who’s the Filly

Billy gesticulates wildly The raven-haired Girl turns away
but Billy reaches out pulls her back He speaks intensely
to her She seems to soften pecks him on the cheek

INT RETT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
This time Rett carries a Baja Fresh takeout bag There’s a
small CHRISTMAS TREE over in the corner and various LIGHTS
and DECORATIONS pinned up in hasty half-assed fashion

Rett knocks on Billy’s door walks right on in finding Billy
at his computer in the midst of an AIM session

Sensing Rett’s presence Billy immediately SIGNS OFF

RETT
You hungry I got burritos here

Billy shakes his head His face looks drawn pinched
RETT
What’s wrong Sport

Billy stares at the floor before deciding to answer

BILLY
Jess took off

You mean like ran away

BILLY
Nobody knows where she is

Rett furrows his brow sits on the bed
RETT
Well that’s just awful Something

Billy clams up shrugs Annoyed by Rett’s proximity
RETT
Jesus Her poor folks Must be
worried half to death
Billy moves his miserable stare out the window
RETT

She’ll be back buddy Most of the
time they come right back home

Rett slings an arm across boy’s narrow shoulders Billy’s

eyes flare and he pushes Rett’s arm right off

BILLY
That’s bullshit Why do you always
act like you know everything You
don’t know her You don’t even
know how to pay a bill

RETT
Aw come on that’s not fair--

Billy angrily shoves Rett away or at leasthe tries

BILLY

silently EXPLODES into fiery ribbons the sparks softly
tumbling downward--

EXT RETT’S HOUSE - MORNING
TWO POLICE CARS are parked beside Rett’s truck one a
regulation Cruiser the other an unmarked Crown Vic
INT RETT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Rett sits on the couch ashen dark patches under his eyes
Across from him sit TWO MEN who are both COPS though you
wouldn’t necessarily know from their hastily thrown-on street
clothes It is after all Christmas Morning
One is CAPTAIN DEX BALLARD 60 white hair white moustache
well-fed hands the size of catcher’s mitts The other is

DETECTIVE ERIK JORGENSEN 35 quite tall shaved head blond
moustache armor-piercing stare

The cops scribble notes onto pads as they gently pepper Rett
with questions

BALLARD
Plates on the Civic 4-9-2-7-G-C-L

RETT
G-C-H

JORGENSEN
That voicemail he sent you--

BALLARD
Now was he callin from a pay
phone or a cell phone

RETT
I don’t know--

JORGENSEN
Gonna need some pictures of Billy
Clear ones like a school portrait--

RETT
Do me a favor Jorgensen shut the
fuck up about school portraits

Rett starts to shiver so he stands up walks to the window
clenches his jaw tightly He’s keeping it together only by
an act of will

BALLARD
Any chance maybe he stopped on the
way down Got tired had some car
trouble something

But it’s like Rett can’t even hear him Like his mind is
filling with white noise growing steadily louder

RETT
(to himself to nobody)
God damn car I never shouldve
Billy Making me feel so sick

Ballard and Jorgensen exchange grim uncomfortable looks

JORGENSEN
(to Ballard)
Gonna head to the station Rustle
some leaves down in Ventura County
Get this thing rolling

Ballard nods discreetly and Jorgensen heads out the door

BALLARD
Everett

The old man approaches Rett and slowly gently puts his
hands on Rett’s shoulders

RETT
Something’s bad Dex Something’s
fuckin wrong

BALLARD
I’ve known you your whole life
You’re a soldier Strong as an ox
And that boy of yours smart as a
goddamn whip Times like this a
man gotta rise to the occasion
Just like you did over in Kuwait
Stay on the positive side of
things We’ll figure this out

Rett stands there struggling clenched like a statue
RETT
Just wanna know Where he is
Swear to God Never let him out of
my sight again

Dread washes over Rett’s face swims through his eyes

INT JAMESON and SON AUTO - DAY
Rett sits staring at his desk looking like utter hell
TITLE BURN THREE DAYS LATER

He’s wearing the same clothes we last saw him in It’s
abundantly clear he’s had no rest no relief no reprieve

MOY (0S)
Boss You don’t gotta be here

Rett doesn’t turn to Moy who stands behind him stricken
RETT
(hoarse blank)
Yeah

MOY
You gotta sleep man

RETT
Okay

But Rett doesn’t move an inch just stares

Moy wishes he knew how to be how to act but he doesn’t

EXT FIELD - CALABASAS - DAY

Two long-haired 15-year old BOYS are stumbling across a
barren rocky FIELD passing a joint

In the distance the 101 Freeway hums and drones endlessly

BoY 1
So fuckin faded

BOY 2
Flying

They walk in a dewy-eyed daze toward a copse of small trees
and thick brush The joint gets passed again

BoY 1
Fuck is that You see that

The boy’s eyes are fixed on SOMETHING on the ground just
hidden behind the trees A dark tangled LUMP

BOY 2
(creeped)
Yeah I see it

They pick their way closer--

EXT RETT’S HOUSE - EVENING

Rett’s truck pulls up the drive A Cruiser is already parked
there and Ballard is standing beside it

Ballard stands erect but his face is a crumpled misery
Rett steps out of the truck Ballard slowly removes his hat

RETT
Put your hat back on Dex

Ballard kicks the dirt Takes a deep breath

BALLARD
Everett There’s something--

RETT
Put your fuckin hat back on Dex

Ballard slowly approaches Rett

BALLARD
Everett

Rett backs up against his truck Catches a GLIMPSE of
himself in the side-mirror

And abruptly SMASHES the side-mirror RIGHT OFF THE TRUCK
with FOUR QUICK BLOWS of his forearm

Ballard’s eyes drop to the ground

We pull back far away Because like Rett we don’t want to
see We don’t want to hear

cur TO

INT MORGUE - STOPPED TIME
A cold stark pale-green-lit ROOM

A GURNEY sits in the middle of the room A SHEET-COVERED
LUMP lies on the gurney

Standing behind the gurney waiting is Ballard and a white-
coat-clad MEDICAL EXAMINER

Rett’s face is a rictus of horror and incomprehension
BALLARD
I’m so sorry Everett But we have
to do this (beat) It’s just
gotta be done
Rett shifts closer on feet made of stone
The Medical Examiner pulls back the sheet
Rett’s face His EYES
Whatever light whatever hope was left inside them-- is
snuffed out in this exact crystalline moment

INT SHERIFFS STATION - BALLARD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Rett sits strangely erect glassy-eyed in an orange vinyl
armchair across from Ballard’s desk

Ballard silently fills a coffee mug from a bottle of
Bushmills hands it to Rett

Rett holds the mug doesn’t drink

BALLARD
I know there ain’t anything I can
say that’ll give you comfort I
won’t insult you by trying

Rett slowly nods stares into the mug

BALLARD
He didn’t suffer Everett Just
once through the heart It was
over quick Wasn’t no pain

Rett dips his finger into the brown booze swirls it around
brings the finger to his lips sucks it absently

BALLARD
I’ve spoken to Linda She’1ll be
comin on up tomorrow

Rett lets out a small groan takes a big gulp from the mug
spilling a good portion down the front of his shirt

BALLARD
Don’t be worrying yourself about
(beat) The arrangements We’1l
take care of all that Up Pine
Lawns Right beside your Old Man
Rett MUMBLES something wiping blankly at his shirt

BALLARD
I didn’t catch that son

Rett just stares back at him Death-numb

RETT
I said you can bury me too

cuT TO BLACK

EXT PINE LAWNS MEMORIAL PARK - DAY
A windy white heartlessly cold morning
A small GROUP gathers loosely around an OPEN GRAVE a shiny

green CASKET perched above it on straps Some folks we’ve
seen before like Ballard and Moy and some we haven’t

An auburn-haired WOMAN 36 pretty but grief-wracked stands
unsteadily by the grave surrounded by three YOUNG GIRLS
aged 3-8 who cry softly simply because their mother cries
This is LINDA Rett’s ex in the arms of her new HUSBAND

Rett stands slightly apart from the group in a somewhat ill-
fitting dark suit expressionless

A MINISTER drones but most of his words are lost in the
wind Words like tragedy and so young and such promise

Rett’s eyes wander over the surrounding terrain the bleak
rolling hills the many trees and headstones

His eyes land on a huge stark ELM a few hundred yards away--

Where a LONE FEMALE FIGURE stands half-hidden Even though
it’s so far away it looks like she iswatching

He turns back to the hole in the ground The casket begins
to slowly descend Rett suddenly SITS DOWN on the grass
folding his legs Indian-style

HANDS reach down to him and he brushes them away like flies

EXT ELM TREE - PINE LAWNS - CONTINUOUS

The same tree Rett was just staring at Standing next to it
is the same tall Goth-looking YOUNG WOMAN we’ve seen once
before talking to Billy outside the coffee shop

This is JESS hair now PLATINUM shivering against the cold
face drawn her eyes filled with regret misery Shame

JESS
So sorry Billy Fuck I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry--
A sob catches in her throat She covers her face shakes
She starts to walk away Until she starts RUNNING
And that fucking wind blows--

CUT TO BLACK

INT RETT’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

Rett lies flat on his back eyes open staring half-lidded at
the ceiling He looks about 10 years older His hair is
shaggy and he’s got a thick unruly beard

His CLOCK RADIO ALARM blares to life He lets it blare

Like he needs the alarm anyway

Like he ever gets a decent night’s sleep

EXT JAMESON and SON AUTO - DAY

Rett sits at his desk which is piled high with unopened
letters many of them featuring angry hostile text

URGENT and PAST DUE and PENALTY and OPEN IMMEDIATELY

He rises from the desk walks zombie-like into the garage
where he finds Moy the lone employee sweeping up

RETT
Go talk to Tomlinson like I said

Moy crosses his arms shakes his head

old dyed-redhead named BETHANY who approaches

BETHANY
How’s tricks Rett

RETT
I’d like six of the Cuervo All in
a little row And one for

wouldn’t mind joining in

Bethany’s eyes flicker with uncertainty but only for an
instant She smiles nods pulls the bottle

As she pours the shots Rett’s eyes wander down the bar to
where a spiffy-dressed JORGENSEN is laughing it up with a

Rett stares at them until Jorgensen notices him nods in
greeting smile fading Rett lifts a shot in toast

Jorgensen chuckles uncomfortably wanders over followed by
Miller and Czerny

JORGENSEN
Hey there Jameson

RETT
Officers Lookin pretty dapper
Detective You got a date
JORGENSEN
No these are just my work clothes
All those shots for you

RETT
Got myself a little theory why you
dress all fancy like that

JORGENSEN
Do you now

Rett downs another shot

RETT
I do indeed It’s so you can
remind the rest of them dumb-ass
bulls that you’re the one with the
college ed-u-cation

Jorgensen snorts while the Deputies clearly bristle

CZERNY
Why you gotta be an asshole your
whole life Jameson

Rett raises shot 3 grins blankly at Czerny

RETT
And here’s to your sister Czerny
That time she let me and three
other guys fuck her in your

JORGENSEN

every rock in this county Like I
didn’t work this case for half a
year without sleeping a wink

RETT

That why you gave up on Billy you
spit-shined donkey-boy

JORGENSEN
Fuck you I gave up There’s
nothing Jameson Nada No car
No witnesses Colder than a
goddamn ice cube When you gonna
understand that

Rett stares at the remaining shots in front of him He picks
one up downs it eyes bleary far away Jorgensen softens

JORGENSEN
I won’t ever give up okay That
isn’t just a promise It’s my job
It’s who I am There’s things I
can do for you I can help you

Rett glares coldly at Jorgensen

RETT
Help me You probably couldn’t
help an old lady cross the goddamn
fuckin street

Jorgensen nods grimly

JORGENSEN
That’s real nice Jameson But I’m
not your enemy No matter how hard
you try to make me one

Jorgensen walks away followed by the Deputies Rett stares
at the remaining shots jaw clenched He quickly downs them
one after the other

He gets up wobbles over and TACKLES JORGENSEN to the floor

Before anyone can even react Rett lets loose a FLURRY of
hard PUNCHES to Jorgensen’s face

MILLER
God damnit Jameson

The two Deputies SWARM over Rett haul him off Jorgensen but
Rett sends a quick sharp ELBOW to Miller’s TEMPLE sending
him FLYING backwards knocking over some bar stools

Czerny busts his NIGHTSTICK out gives Rett a hard THWACK
across the backs of his knees--

Rett CRUMPLES to the floor but still manages to turn his
body and SWEEP Czerny’s LEGS out from under him--

And then Rett LEAPS onto a dazed Czerny and proceeds to BEAT
the living PISS out of his FACE all while wearing a strange
blank GRIN of drunken oblivion
RETT
(with each punch)
Fuck your sister Fuck your
sister Fuck that bitch--

THWACK Miller CLOCKS Rett across the back of the head with
his NIGHTSTICK and Rett goes LIMP slides to the floor

And good night

against the wall

BALLARD

EXT PASO ROBLES STREETS - CONTINUOUS
Rett shuffles along as morning traffic rumbles around him

He walks out onto an OVERPASS which spans the 101 Freeway
Watches the cars and trucks rumble by below

He turns away shuffles further along the overpass And
that’s when a PISS-YELLOW CIVIC cruises past him

Rett stops FROZEN follows the car with saucer-wide eyes

RETT

He starts to walk after the car which is now approaching the
Southbound on-ramp Within seconds he’s SPRINTING

The car RATTLES as it takes a left onto the on-ramp Rett
sprints after it but then he TRIPS pitches forward onto the
sidewalk SPLAYS hard and ugly

over the railing just in time to see the Civic slide into
Southbound 101 traffic and disappear

He looks at his WATCH it’s just past 730 am

Rett sits in his truck on the roadside sipping his coffee
eyes alert staring out the windshield radio playing low

Up ahead the ACCESS ROAD merges into the OVERPASS From
this spot Rett has a perfect view of all the vehicles
getting on the Southbound ramp

He checks his watch 718 am

He continues his vigil Picks up a pair of binoculars scans
the cars waiting at the on-ramp

He’s so fixated on that particular ramp he DOESN’T SEE the
YELLOW CIVIC approaching from the OPPOSITE direction heading
up the OFF-RAMP from the NORTHBOUND side of the 101

It’s just outside his field of vision ZIPPING past--

Rett SEES the Civic just in time as it’s disappearing around
a sharp CURVE The thermos goes FLYING as he scrambles to
start the truck jams it into Drive--

EAST PASO HIGH SCHOOL

Rett pulls up at the sidewalk opposite the drive

He watches the Civic pull up to the front entrance of the
school The passenger door opens and a short dark-haired
BOY hops out about 15 carrying a backpack

HOSPITAL where the Civic slides into a spot

Rett idles at a distance watching intently

The Civic’s door pops open and a TALL DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
emerges mid-30s wearing PINK NURSE SCRUBS

As the WOMAN walks toward the hospital entrance she pins her
long black hair into a tight bun

When she walks it’s fluid feminine-- almost a sashay Even
in the scrubs no doubt she’s a looker

RETT
My goodness

She disappears into the hospital
He hops out of his truck carrying a small bag of TOOLS

He slowly approaches the Civic runs his hand along the roof
entranced He assesses the various dings chips dents

He whispers softly to the car like a lover
RETT

His eyes search the parking lot sees there’s nobody around
He pulls a SLIM JIM from his bag and POPS the lock in
seconds He slips quickly inside pops the trunk climbs out

The truck is parked on the street outside the hospital lot
The interior is littered with empty soda cans and wrappers

The sun hangs low in the sky He’s clearly been sitting
there for hours and hours

his neck grunting with the satisfying pops and clicks

Then he catches sight of HER across the lot pulling the pins
from her hair as she sashays her dark tresses cascading--

The yellow Civic zips down the thoroughfare Suddenly it
LURCHES and SMOKE starts to waft from under the hood

The WOMAN emerges from the Civic looking distraught She
shivers against the evening chill as traffic whizzes past

WOMAN
Piece of shit Piece of shit

She digs her cell phone out of her purse and a bright red F-
750 pulls to the side of the road just in front of her

A smiling Rett hops out ambles over

WOMAN

He gestures toward his truck where JAMESON and SON AUTO is
emblazoned on the TAILGATE

She glances at the tailgate back at him finally shrugs

RETT

Looking at him askance she slides into the car pops it

Rett rolls up his sleeves props open the hood starts poking
around inside Black SMOKE still curls from within

RETT

She appears next to him staring into the guts of the car
clueless exasperated

WOMAN

RETT
You don’t want me to tell you

WOMAN

Rett rises from the hood wipes his hands on his pants

RETT

WOMAN
So what’s that mean Fix the hole

Rett grits his teeth sucks air in
RETT
You can’t wash off the clutch The
clutch is done It’s toast
The woman starts to pace around her eyes a bit wild
WOMAN
That’s expensive isn’t it Shit

wanna know Jesus Christ

Rett lays a reassuring hand on her shoulder

RETT
Hey

She immediately SWATS his hand away
WOMAN

Rett backs up holds up both his hands in surrender
RETT

Whoa now This ain’t anything
like that I sure didn’t mean--

WOMAN

goddamn hands on people

Rett has backed up all the way to his truck hands up
RETT

blue truth in his eyes She softens

Rett trudges up a a steep path lined on both sides by
HEADSTONES laid flush into the grass like place mats

His eyes wander across the hill about a hundred yards away
where a tall GIRL is descending in the opposite direction

Wrapped in a black overcoat her hair a WHITE-BLONDE shock
Rett squints at her Something familiar strange He WAVES

The girl FREEZES Swaying in the wind Then she continues
down the hill much more rapidly Rett watches head cocked
as she hurries to the PARKING LOT

Rett continues on up the hill crouches down beside Billy’s
HEADSTONE and frowns

Because there’s a small bouquet of WHITE FLOWERS sitting
there So fresh and perfectly white they’ve clearly only
been sitting there a short while

He picks up the flowers On the wrapping it says McCardle
Bros Florist Cambria

Rett peers back down the hill toward the PARKING LOT--

The little white HATCHBACK zips out of the entrance and
DISAPPEARS into the woods beyond

They only want minors

You still haven’t told me who
“they” are

Jess stands up mashes out her smoke lights another

RETT

JESS
It’s always motels At both ends
Down there it’s usually somewhere
north of LA Thousand Oaks

You must mark the cars somehow So
they know which ones to pick up

Jess looks at him her expression quizzical

Rett turns to her considers the question doesn’t answer

JESS

RETT
Is that why you ran away Because

He digs around through the medicine cabinet and finds
something he hasn’t used in quite some time A RAZOR

EXT CARLA’S PLACE - NIGHT

Carla opens the door to find Rett on her porch holding a

bottle of wine smiling sheepishly

He’s now clean-shaven

with a few nicks and dings scattered across his face

She nods in appreciation

CARLA

Wow You clean up pretty good

He admires her fitted jeans and flattering scoop-necked top

her hair falling past her shoulders

RETT
You look real nice too

They both seem slightly embarrassed

bit too hard and aren’t sure why

CARLA’S PLACE - DINETTE - LATER

Like maybe they tried a

cur TO

Carla Rett and a sullen-looking Alfonso are finishing up

their plates of casserole

RETT
It was my Pop’s garage and my
Grandpa before him Started workin
there right after I shipped back
from Kuwait

CARLA
I wish I knew about cars I look
under the hood and it’s like I’m
retarded or something

RETT
Yeah well I wish I knew how to
sew people back together

CARLA
It’s not that romantic really
Just sticking folks with needles
cleaning up a lot of mess

RETT
Still I bet you’re good at it

They smiles at each other Alfonso stares at Rett wipes his
mouth with a napkin Actually decides to speak

And when he does its the thin somewhat strained tone of a
voice rarely used

ALFONSO
Did you ever kill anybody

Carla looks at him taken aback

CARLA
Alfonso

But the boy keeps staring at Rett waiting for an answer

RETT
You mean while I was in the
Service

CARLA

(to Alfonso)
Why would you ask something like
that That’s not right

RETT
No it’s okay It’s a fair
question

CARLA

It is not a fair question
Rett looks at Alfonso openly

RETT
I saw some scary stuff Alfonso
Seen people hurt real bad
Sometimes they died (beat) But
the answer to your question is no
I never killed anybody

Alfonso nods as if satisfied Drinks his soda Carla sighs
in exasperation shakes her head

CARLA
He sure can pick his moments

Rett waves it off keeps looking at Alfonso
RETT
Anytime you wanna ask me something
you just go right on ahead Okay

Alfonso nods Even manages a hint of a smile

RETT
We got a deal then Good

Carla watches the two guys interact It’s been awhile
she saw her boy smile She looks happy about it

EXT CARLA’S DRIVEWAY - LATER
Carla and Rett stand by his truck in the dark

RETT
No I liked it It was nice

They look at each other Both unsure but beguiled

CARLA
You must’ve been real young When
you became a Daddy

RETT
Yep Barely nineteen

CARLA
I was eighteen

RETT
Babies making babies

She nods smiles sadly

CARLA
Gotta give Fonso a little time He
already likes you I can tell
It’s just he hastroubles
sometimes (beat) His father
(beat) He’s not a good man We
don’t talk anymore

Rett nods smiles earnestly

RETT
I like Alfonso too

CARLA
He’s a good fucking kid I just
wish I knew what went on inside his
little head Drives me crazy

RETT
I know exactly what you mean

She surprises him with a kiss on the lips which lingers for

just a second or two before she pulls away and trots back

to the house Rett stares after her wide-eyed

She turns back looks at him with a sly guilty smile

CARLA
Sorry
(points at herself)

She disappears into the house Rett stands there

INT RETT’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rett stands outside of BILLY’S DOOR holding a small KEY
reaches for the PADLOCK unlocks it pops open the hinge

He takes a deep breath opens the door

He

He walks inside Flips on the light Breathes in the stale

air He walks to the desk Starts going through the
drawers Carefully at first

But pretty soon he’s RANSACKING the room Pulling books off

their shelves Flipping the mattress

He moves to the CLOSET Flings aside clothes Kneels on the

floor and digs through the shoes

He goes further into the closet feels around pulls up a
small RUG and finds several LOOSE FLOORBOARDS

Sweating he PRIES the boards upwards revealing a HOLE
underneath containing THREE CIGAR BOXES all in a row

He pauses breathing hard stares at the boxes He slowly
reaches in takes one out opens it

Inside tight rubber-banded BUNDLES OF CASH All of them
TWENTIES and FIFTIES He stares at the cash agape

RETT
Jesus Christ

He reaches in and opens the other boxes All of them
literally STUFFED with cash Thousands of dollars

RETT
(hoarse)
What were you doing Sport
INTEXT - RETT’S TRUCK - EAST PASO HIGH - DAY

Rett rolls very slowly through the STUDENT PARKING LOT of
East Paso High School

He’s checking the rear bumpers of every single car in the
packed lot It’s slow going There are hundreds of cars

Suddenly he STOPS Leans out the window eyes fixed on a
RED JETTA On the left side of the rear bumper-- a small
round STICKER with THREE BLACK STARS all in a row
Rett throws the truck into park grabs a FLASHLIGHT

He lowers himself to the pavement between the Jetta anda
neighboring car and SCOOTCHES himself under

SHINES the flashlight up into the UNDERCARRIAGE of the Jetta
POV a familiar-looking RECTANGULAR STEEL BOX

RETT
Gotcha

Rett flicks off the flashlight shimmies out from under--

VOICE (0S)
Heip you with something sir

Still on the ground Rett looks up to see a thickly-built
dull-eyed 20-something SCHOOL SECURITY GUARD staring at him

Rett hops to his feet grins amiably
RETT
No no fine Just dropped
something

Rett holds up the flashlight grins cheerfully

RETT
Found it

The Guard gives him a funny look

GUARD
This is a private student lot sir
For the high school
Rett slowly makes his way over to the truck
RETT
Yes and thank you You’re doing a
bang-up job here Keeping the
young folks safe and such
The Guard frowns unsure if Rett’s taking the piss or not

GUARD
Um

EXT PASO ROBLES SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON

Rett sits in his truck parked at the side of the road a few
hundred yards away from the High School driveway

School has let out and cars are now POURING out of the lot
His cell phone rings he checks the call opens it

RETT
What’s up Moy

MOY’S VOICE
That dude Ruttledge called again

He’s trying to clock all the cars that emerge up ahead

RETT
Okay (beat) Anything else

MOY’S VOICE
Youre not gonna sell to that

And that’s when he sees the RED JETTA zipping out of the lot
and disappearing in the opposite direction

RETT
Gotta call you back cabron

Rett snaps the phone shut tosses it on the seat TAKES OFF
up the street after the Jetta

EXT RED ROOF INN - DAY

The red Jetta pulls into the parking lot of a rundown Red
Roof Inn right off the freeway slides into a spot

Rett’s truck cruises past the entrance and heads into the
adjacent TACO BELL parking lot

INT RETT’S TRUCK -— CONTINUOUS

Rett WATCHES the Jetta in the adjacent lot

A tall lanky YOUNG MAN 17-ish wearing a black skullcap
emerges from the Jetta His eyes dart around sketchy

He shoves a set of KEYS on the right rear TIRE He shoulders
a backpack trots over to the motel climbs a set of stairs
and disappears into ROOM 207

Suddenly in Rett’s MIND’S EYE he SEES THE FOLLOWING

--The YELLOW CIVIC in the parking lot BILLY emerging from
the Civic wearing a backpack putting the KEYS on the TIRE

--Then BILLY jogs toward the motel heads up the stairs
opens a door and disappears inside and the DOOR SLAMS SHUT--
EXT RED ROOF INN - MINUTES LATER

A BLACK EL CAMINO with a jacked-up suspension and mag wheels
rumbles into the Red Roof lot

Rett slides lower into his seat

The Camino cruises to the end of the lot stops behind the
Jetta The passenger door opens and a tall sinewy DUDE
with a blond Mohawk emerges Tight jeans and a stained
thermal top black shit-kicker boots Call him MILK

Casual as can be Milk grabs the keys off the Jetta’s wheel
climbs in behind the wheel and exits the lot followed
closely by the black Camino

INTEXT - RETT’S TRUCK - VARIOUS - DAY

The Jetta and the Camino cruise eastward along Route 46
Several hundred yards behind Rett’s truck pursues

The populated city area soon gives way to rural wilderness
The winter sun blasts a cold blinding glare

They pass by some ramshackle homesteads small farms rusted
cars up on blocks trailers skinny dogs

This part of California is hard country both in geography
and attitude This ain’t LA It’s more like TEXAS

The JettaCamino caravan pulls off the main road onto a
winding rutted two-lane blacktop

INT RETT’S TRUCK - A BIT LATER

Rett cruises along the winding desolate road and slows down
when he sees the JettaCamino caravan just up ahead pulling
off the two-lane onto a DIRT ROAD that crosses a CATTLE GUARD
before butting up against a large IRON GATE

Rett pulls his cap low and DRIVES PAST the dirt road
catching a quick glimpse of MILK UNLOCKING the GATE--

He keeps right on going and checks his REAR-VIEW where he
sees the Camino and the Jetta passing through the GATE
EXT FOOTHILLS - AFTERNOON

Rett is crouched hidden in the brush on a small rise
overlooking the spread of hills

He peers through his BINOCULARS at a dried-up RANCH in the
near distance A couple of TRAILERS several large
corrugated-metal STRUCTURES a tall rotting WATER TOWER
Welcome to THE FARM

Rett spies several tricked-out yet dusty VEHICLES including
the black El Camino

Every few seconds a flurry of distant DOG BARKS

There’s some MOVEMENT down there and Rett focuses in on the
red JETTA as it slowly rolls into a giant OPENING in one of
the corrugated-metal STRUCTURES

Once the Jetta is inside a huge metal DOOR slides shut

Rett’s CELL PHONE rings he sets down the Binocs digs the
phone out of his pocket

RETT
Gotta get back to ya Moy

CARLA’S VOICE (0S)

EXT RETT’S TRUCK - TACO BELL PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
Rett sits watching the Red Roof Inn sipping on a big soda

He slides low into his seat when the JETTA cruises into the
Red Roof lot followed by the black EL CAMINO

The LOADED JETTA slides into its former spot a scowling MILK
hops out lays the keys on the tire climbs into the Camino

The Camino HONKS THREE TIMES then cruises out of the lot
Rett’s eyes shift up to ROOM 207 in the motel

Sure enough a few seconds later the tall BOY with the black
skullcap emerges from Room 207

The boy’s eyes dart around the lot as he makes his way down
to the Jetta He feels for the keys GRABS THEM

QUICK FLASH
Rett’s MIND’S EYE

--BILLY trots over to his CIVIc finds the KEYS ON THE TIRE
and JUMPS IN--

Back to REALITY Rett grits his teeth

RETT
Alright Pony boy let’s go

The loaded Jetta starts to pull out of the lot

Rett starts up his truck

standing in the passenger window head cocked smirking

RETT

Rett’s eyes dart to the Jetta now CRUISING UP THE STREET

Jorgensen slowly nods eyes steely
JORGENSEN

Rett turns on the ignition Jorgensen quietly seething
backs away from the window taps his own forehead

JORGENSEN
Be seeing you soon pal
INT RETT’S TRUCK - MINUTES LATER

Rett tries to maneuver through the dense traffic searching
for any sign of the Jetta

But it’s clearly a lost cause The Jetta is long gone
Rett pounds the wheel in frustration

Rett grins tries to TOOT his horn but NO SOUND comes out
Billy grabs the KEYS from the TIRE

RETT

Billy turns toward Rett flashes a grin and salutes

Rett tries to open his door It won’t open He starts to
panic He tries the passenger door but it also won’t open

RETT
Wait Just please wait

Billy climbs into the car reverses out of the spot

RETT

Rett THRASHES wildly in his truck unable to escape unable

foot of the couch staring at him with haunted eyes

RETT
Whoa Hey (beat) You okay

something bad I don’t wanna do it
but I can’t stop

RETT
What’s the bad thing

Alfonso’s voice falls to a whisper
ALFONSO
I don’t know but it’s really

Rett reaches for Alfonso pulls him closer on the couch
Puts his arm around him At first the boy resists but
eventually gives in rests against Rett’s shoulder
RETT
Dreams don’t play fair Sport
They kick you when you’re down
But they ain’t nothin but smoke

Alfonso settles himself more tightly against Rett His eyes
still open glassy scared

INT CARLA’S PLACE - LIVING ROOM - 5AM

Carla quietly enters through the front door By the light of
the flickering TV she sees Rett and Alfonso asleep on the

couch together Rett’s arm slung protectively over her boy

She stands there looking at them her tired eyes growing wet
Tides of conflicting emotion sweep across her face

INT RETT’S TRUCK - BACK ROADS —- DAY
Rett cruises through the rolling desolate terrain

His fingers drum the wheel

His eyes laser-focused on the road ahead

EXT FOOTHILLS - DAY

Rett’s truck is parked in the same hidden spot on a rise
overlooking THE FARM

He peers through his binoculars No movement at all down
there Sleepy as a retirement home

He tosses the binocs into the truck pulls a TIRE IRON out of
the bed jams it down the back of his jeans

He empties his pockets removes his wristwatch places
everything carefully in the glove compartment

He tightens his belt fastened by a heavy thick cowboy-style
BRASS BUCKLE about 4 inches wide

He sets off walking down the hill toward the Farm

EXT DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Rett CLIMBS to the top of the black iron GATE quick and
agile maneuvers himself over the top and DROPS to the dirt
road beyond He sticks the landing proceeds up the road

Up ahead the black silhouette of the WATER TOWER looms over
the sunblasted deathly quiet spread of buildings
EXT THE FARM - CONTINUOUS

The dirt road ends at a dusty wide-open LOT containing all
the shitty buildings

There doesn’t seem to be a soul around Only the wind anda
few quick DOG BARKS punching through the silence

Rett slowly approaches the closest TRAILER knocks
tentatively on the door There’s no answer

His eyes dart around The hairs on his neck stand up

He reaches for the door handle twists it and whadaya know
it’s UNLOCKED

He pulls open the door
From inside a quick SILENT FLASH of MOVEMENT--
A rust-colored PIT BULL LAUNCHES OUT OF THE TRAILER--

And SIXTY POUNDS of pure canine muscle COLLIDES with Rett
PLOWING him off the steps into the DIRT--

Rett ROLLS quickly yanking the TIRE IRON from his jeans and
just as the PIT LUNGES for his THROAT he SWINGS HARD
catching the dog square in the SKULL

The Pit YELPS the tire iron FLIES out of Rett’s hands and
the dog SKITTERS across the dirt DAZED--

Rett eyes BUGGED with adrenaline leaps to his feet as the
Pit RUSHES HIM AGAIN with terrifying speed--

Rett throws his arms out and CATCHES the dog in MID-AIR his
hands CLAMPED around the dog’s thick sinewy THROAT

The Pit’s limbs FLAIL wildly CLAWING at Rett’s torso its
huge jaws SNAPPING mere INCHES from his FACE--

With a superhuman GRUNT Rett HURLS the squirming animal
through the OPEN TRAILER DOOR and KICKS IT SHUT

A series of hard THUMPS as the Pit HURLS its bulk against
the door over and over the trailer SHAKING with each blow

Rett crouches gasping for breath eyes wide--

VOICE (0S)
Ain’t that some shit

Rett wheels around sees a tall rail-thin BLACK MAN his
bare arms laced with RAISED SCARS pointing a SAWED-OFF

This is TELLY could be 25 could be 45 hasn’t slept ina
year and that’s just how he likes it

TELLY
No doubt Shit was real

Rett raises his hands palms out
RETT

TELLY

Rett squints sizing up this freak

RETT
Because you’re not

Telly mad-dogs him spits on the ground

TELLY
Stand the fuck up

Rett stands up still showing his hands

There’s a CLANG off to his left and Rett turns to see THREE
DUDES emerging from one of the corrugated-metal BUILDINGS

All of them dirty strung-out HARD-LOOKING FUCKS Rotten
teeth patchy beards cold eyes full sleeves of ugly INK

Rett turns back to Telly who grins a mouthful of GOLD

TELLY
Yeah you scared now Piss your
little white panties

One of the Fucks whom we remember as MILK 28 steps up--
dirty jeans shirtless a grotesque display of sexualized
violence INKED across his chest

MILK

Rett eyeballs the guy taking his time

RETT

pick-up boy Wanna see the Boss
Milk stalks forward his face inches away from Rett’s

MILK
Fuck you say faggot

Rett wrinkles his nose
RETT
God damn Your breath stinks like
two-week-old baby-diaper shit
Milk narrows his eyes then PUNCHES RETT HARD IN THE BALLS
Rett GASPS crumples to the ground curls into a ball

Telly and the other Fucks BRADY (acne-scarred) and SCOTCH
(whiteblond translucent-pale) LAUGH their fuckin ASSES off

TELLY
Ho shit

Milk hawks up a loog DROOLS it down onto Rett’s HEAD

MILK
How’s that feel cunty

Milk lifts his leg and proceeds to RUB the sticky phlegm into
Rett’s hair with the bottom of his BOOT--

Which makes it all-too-easy for Rett to SWEEP MILK’S OTHER
LEG out from UNDER HIM--

As Milk CRUMPLES to the ground Rett’s back on his feet and
he KICKS Milk straight in the FACE while simultaneously
UNHOOKING his belt SLIPPING it out through the loops--

BRADY RUSHES Rett throwing HAYMAKER PUNCHES and Rett draws
back an SWINGS THE BELT--

The thick heavy BRASS BUCKLE WHISTLES through the air and
CLOCKS BRADY in the JAW drawing BLOOD--

Rett gets in a few more good hard LICKS with the belt before
he’s OVERWHELMED by a bleeding Milk Scotch and Brady who
TOPPLE him in a FLURRY of KICKS and PUNCHES--

TELLY
HOLD that muhfuck--

They PIN Rett to the ground KNEELING on his ARMS and LEGS

Telly stands over a dazed Rett JAMMING the SAWED-OFF BARRELS
against Rett’s THROAT

TELLY
Wanna get feisty Wanna fuck
nigga Gonna squeeze this shit and
you be all done boy--

Telly’s eyes are BUGGED veins POPPING and he’s about to
SQUEEZE THAT SHIT--—

VOICE (0S)
Ease off that now sweetness

Telly pulls the gauge away from Rett’s throat steps back
Rett bloody battered cranes his neck to see a thickly-
built MAN approaching 40-ish greasy thinning orange hair

sunglasses long orange BEARD chopped square at the bottom

He pushes his shades up onto his sun-scorched scalp
revealing the tiny pinned DOTS of his anthracite-black eyes

There’s no doubt who’s in charge around here It’s LANDER

LANDER
Stand him up

Brady and Scotch drag Rett to his feet He stands propped
between them sagging bleeding dazed

Lander walks over Studies Rett Reaches out strokes
Rett’s face with a tenderness both sweet and alarming

LANDER
Got yourself all banged up huh
Real sorry about that

Rett coughs sniffles spits some blood to the side

RETT
You’re the boss Good

LANDER
That’s right sugar I’m Lander
Were you lookin for me

Rett nods

LANDER

There’s ways to reach me you know
Proper channels and such Flaming
hoops Bells and whistles That’s

face (beat) I just can’t imagine
how or why you thought this was

TELLY
Because he the stupidest faggot
muhfucker ever walked the Earth

Lander responds without looking away from Rett’s eyes

LANDER
Telly do me a favor shut your fat
greasy nigger lips This cowboy
and me we’re sharing a moment

Telly looks away shamed lip curled

LANDER
You obviously ain’t a cop Cops

judgement And that’s a shame
Because nobody knows you’re here

Rett looks Lander in the eyes tries his best to sound calm

RETT
Just wanna talk to you

LANDER
About what sweetheart

RETT
Ponies

Lander giggles creepily studies Rett some more
LANDER

Lander’s smile falters just a bit He leans close

LANDER
Alright I get it You think you

(beat) It’s gonna be a real
special day for you cowpoke
Lander pulls out a dirty stinking black HOOD

Rett starts to STRUGGLE so Telly RAMS him in the gut with
the stock of his sawed-off bitch

Rett GASPS crumples as the HOOD SLIDES OVER HIS HEAD--
And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK

And we HOLD THE BLACK

SOUNDS of STRUGGLING GRUNTING FEET DRAGGING ALONG DIRT
HOLD THE BLACK

A DOG is BARKING LIKE CRAZY TWO dogs Maybe THREE

The CLANG of a METAL DOOR SLAMMING

The SOUND of DUCT TAPE-- UNROLLING and RIPPING

The HOOD is YANKED OFF and LIGHT FLOODS BACK BLINDING--—
Rett BLINKS away the glare eyes DARTING to his SURROUNDINGS--
He’s inside one of the CORRUGATED METAL STRUCTURES
STRIPPED to his UNDERWEAR

DUCT-TAPED to a metal folding chair

Racks of high-powered HALOGENS in the RAFTERS make the room
BRIGHT as the peak of summertime

And all of his friends are there-- LANDER TELLY BRADY
SCOTCH and a black-and-blue MILK

Oh yeah and SIX MUZZLED PIT BITCHES straining and grunting
against their wall-bolted CHAINS

Rett’s glassy eyes roam to the huge WORKSTATION that occupies
half the interior Chemical tanks Tubes Beakers
Burners Plastic vats Gallons of solvent

All the necessary accoutrements of a large-scale METH LAB

Lander crouches in front of him smiles wide

LANDER
Well hey now sunshine Welcome to
my kitchen This is a real special
privilege for you Only folks ever
seen my kitchen are my cousins
And my pretty girls over there

Rett’s eyes flash to the densely-muscled BITCHES all SIX
standing poised alert staring right back at him

LANDER
Clearly you’ve done some homework
Or you never woulda found us all
the way out here Middle of
goddamn nowhere So if you don’t
mind you’re gonna tell me exactly
what you think you know

Rett’s eyes flick around to the rest of the FUCKS who watch
wearing jittery tweaked-out smiles

Lander pulls out a long thin serrated HUNTING KNIFE

RETT
Wait Just wait--

LANDER
Shhhhh

Lander gently places the TIP against Rett’s solar plexus
slowly drags it across his chest just scraping the surface
of the skin stopping at his left nipple

LANDER
Now start talking before I apply
just a little more pressure here
and I feed your nipple to Lacey and
her sisters

RETT
The kid waits in the motel The
vehicle gets brought here That’s
when it gets retrofitted unless it
already is After it’s loaded you
drop it back at the motel Then
it’s south

Lander nods whistles impressed

LANDER
So you been watching Analyzing
Assimilating Like a cop would
Except you’re not a cop

(MORE)

LANDER (contd)
Which makes me think you’re here
for one of two reasons One
you’re tryin to poke me into a
corner You want somethin in
exchange for keeping my kitchen in
the dark But you don’t seem the
extortin’ type

RETT
I don’t want your money

LANDER
(as if Rett said nothing)
Reason number two is you got some
kinda vested interest

Rett’s eyes twitch

LANDER
Yeah Think I hit on it This
shit’s personal Except I ain’t
ever seen you before Can’t
imagine why you’d jump my fence
beat up my dog then ask me to
dance Why you wanna dance
cowboy You wanna fuck too

Rett stares at Lander with undisguised contempt

RETT
My son was one of those kids In
your piece-of-shit Pony Express
And someone killed him

Lander nods takes this in

LANDER
Well that’s a real shame Boy got
his-self killed (beat) Must’ve
been even dumber than you

With that all four of the FUCKS start LAUGHING THEIR ASSES
OFF Like it’s the funniest thing they ever heard

Rett goes RIGID

His EYES FLICK over each one of them as they laugh TELLY
BRADY SCOTCH MILK Like he’s filing it away

LANDER
You think it was me Oh
sweetheart I almost wish it was
me who killed your boy

(MORE)

LANDER (contd)
Least we both woulda had the
satisfaction of meeting each other
But that just ain’t in the cards
Not today Because I got other
plans for you

Rett’s eyes FLASH as the adrenaline begins to SURGE

RETT
Tell me who your Boss is Tell me
where the shit goes

LANDER
You don’t give up I respect that
kinda tenacity Maybe you’1ll last
a little longer than I thought

Rett’s lips curl into a desperate snarl

RETT
Just tell me where it goes

Lander turns and addresses his henchmen
LANDER

Scotch Milk do me a favor take

the girls next door Don’t forget

the plastic
Scotch and Milk smile greasily They walk over to the
muzzled canines UNHOOK the chains from the wall and lead
them out the door into the daylight

LANDER
You ever play Gladiator sugar

But before Rett can answer the BLACK HOOD is slipped over
his head once again

SMASH TO

INT METAL SHED -— CONTINUOUS

The HOOD comes off and Rett squints into the new interior--
a CORRUGATED SHED about half the size of the Lab

He’s KNEELING on the floor which is covered in PLASTIC
SHEETING Hands DUCT-TAPED behind his back Telly stands
behind him pointing the gauge at his head

Four of the Pit Bitches are muzzled and chained to the wall

The other TWO BITCHES-- one WHITE one BROWN-- are being held
at bay by MILK and SCOTCH at opposite ends of the shed
BRADY stands off to the side grinning in anticipation

Lander walks into view holding a LOADED HYPODERMIC NEEDLE up
to the light tapping out the air bubbles

LANDER
We don’t get cable up here So the
cousinsthey’ve been a little
starved for entertainment

Rett struggles tries to stand until Telly jams the SAWED-
OFF against his EAR

LANDER
So we’re gonna play us some
Gladiator

Lander walks closer with the SYRINGE

LANDER
Rules are real simple Lacey and
Tulip they’re gonna try to make
friends give you kisses and such
And you’re gonna try not to bleed
to death Sounds like fun right

Rett starts to hyper-ventilate His eyes go hazy
LANDER
Just to make things fair I’m gonna
glass you up Gonna make you feel
like Superman with a hard-on

RETT
Don’t--

But it’s too late Because Lander’s already SLID THE NEEDLE
INTO RETT’S NECK Right into the CARTOID

RETT
Ahhhh--

LANDER
Oh sweetness Don’t fight it

Lander DEPRESSES THE PLUNGER
Rett GASPS goes RIGID his pupils shrink to PIN-PRICKS

Brady and Telly drag him to the middle of the plastic-sheeted
floor They REMOVE the TAPE from his hands

The SYRINGE STILL DANGLES from his NECK like a DART--

They LEAVE him there on his hands and knees in his
underwear his eyes like GOLF BALLS--

RETT
Oh my God My god MY GOD

He takes in enormous GULPS of breath the Crank COURSING
through his body like a LOCOMOTIVE--

RETT’S POV Everything GLOWING brightly sounds distilled
crystalline time seeming to SLOW DOWN--

Milk and Scotch are REMOVING the MUZZLES from their dogs--

LANDER
And it’s SHOWTIME

Milk and Scotch RELEASE THE BITCHES--
They SCRABBLE across the plastic quick as LIGHTNING--
Rett takes in a huge ECSTATIC BREATH--

The WHITE dog LEAPS toward him and Rett SWINGS HIS FIST
SMASHING into the bitch’s MUZZLE--

Just as the BROWN bitch CLAMPS DOWN on Rett’s LEFT BICEP
teeth sinking in and Rett DOESN’T EVEN FEEL IT--

Rett LEAPS TO HIS FEET the bitch STILL HANGING from his left
arm He SPITS into his hand and RAMS TWO FINGERS straight
up the dog’s ASSHOLE--

The dog RELEASES its jaws drops to the floor--

Rett HOWLS like a FUCKING ANIMAL and he SCOOPS UP the
stunned WHITE dog with both hands and--

RETT
YOU

CHUCKS IT TEN FEET right at TELLY’S FACE--
Telly’s EYES BUG OUT--

TELLY
MOTHERF--

The dog COLLIDES with TELLY he’s knocked sideways into
BRADY inadvertently PULLING THE TRIGGER--

The SHOTGUN goes BOO-YAH--

And HALF OF BRADY’S HEAD EXPLODES

The FOUR CHAINED-UP BITCHES are GOING FUCKING NUTS--
Telly STARES at his DEAD FRIEND on the floor confused--

Until the BROWN DOG LEAPS UP and CLAMPS onto Telly’s THROAT
DRAGGING him to the ground blood SPRAYING--

Rett HOWLS again YANKS the SYRINGE from his neck and RUNS
STRAIGHT FOR SCOTCH who BACKS UP totally FREAKED--

RETT
YOU

But Rett’s not stopping and he OVERTAKES SCOTCH and STABS
the NEEDLE into his FACE AGAIN and AGAIN until the NEEDLE
BREAKS OFF in Scotch’s EYE SOCKET--

Rett actually LAUGHS OUT LOUD as he grabs Scotch by the head
and SMASHES IT INTO THE WALL AGAIN and AGAIN

Scotch COLLAPSES bleeding eyes rolled back--

Suddenly LANDER pops out and SMASHES A BASEBALL BAT across
Rett’s BACK sending him SPRAWLING--

But Rett just ROLLS with it SLIDING across the blood-smeared
FLOOR PLASTIC too cranked-up to feel a thing--

He slides right over to where the FOUR BITCHES are chained
up grunting going crazy and he PULLS OFF THEIR MUZZLES

Their JAWS SNAP inches from his face but he scoots out of
the way LEAPS to his feet and runs straight for MILK who’s
suddenly pointing a 9MM PISTOL right at him--

MILK
FUCKING DIE YOU FUCK

BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM-- Milk squeezes off FOUR WILD SHOTS and
one of them CATCHES RETT in his LEFT EAR--

Rett’s ear DANGLES half-SEVERED but he KEEPS COMING and
SWATS the pistol away--

RETT
AND YOU

Rett HEAD-BUTTS MILK in the center of his FACE with a
sickening CRUNCH--

Milk DROPS to the floor dazed his nose DESTROYED--

The two UNCHAINED BITCHES trot over GROWL at Rett He LOCKS
EYES with them leans forward shows his OWN TEETH

The dogs LOWER THEIR HEADS whine lick the BLOOD that drips
from their chops

Rett picks up the PISTOL sticks it into the rear waistband
of his underwear and staggers slowly across the room to
where LANDER is crouched by the doorway

RETT
And YOU

Lander gapes up at Rett who is covered in BLOOD-- it STREAMS
down his bitten ARM DRIPS from his half-severed EAR LEAKS
from the puncture in his NECK

LANDER
You don’t want me I ain’t the one
you want You know that

Rett crouches down vibrating and pulsing with sickening
pleasure He barely looks human

RETT
I can feel it My blood TI can
feel it MOVING INSIDE ME

Lander trembles terrified He’s seen a lot of shit in his
life but he’s never witnessed anything like what just
occurred in this blood-soaked room

LANDER
I ain’t the one

Rett picks up the roll of DUCT TAPE Starts TYING LANDER’S
HANDS TOGETHER Then his FEET

Lander believing he’s in the presence of the Devil himself
just sits there lets it happen

LANDER
You want Cesar I can tell you
where he is I can help you I
can point the way

Butt Rett’s already too far gone to truly absorb what Lander
is saying He reaches for Lander curiously like a child
wiping BLOOD across his face

RETT
I can feel your fear I can taste
it Like copper

LANDER
It was Cesar Please

RETT
(like the word means
nothing)
Cesare

LANDER
I’1l tell you where to find him
Please don’t hurt me

RETT
I won’t hurt you

Rett stands up Walks toward the back of the room where the
FOUR OTHER DOGS are chained to the wall

LANDER
I’1l tell you everything I’m
sorry It wasn’t right what I did

The dogs BOW their heads supplicant as Rett approaches

LANDER
There’s money You can have it
You can have it all just don’t hurt
me I’1ll take you to Cesar

One by one Rett unhooks the Bitches from their chains

Across the room Lander starts to WRIGGLE MADLY His eyes
flooded with PANIC

LANDER
SAID YOU WOULDN’T SAID YOU
WOULDN’T HURT ME YOU SAID

Rett walks over to Milk’s moaning semi-conscious body grabs
him by the legs and starts DRAGGING him toward the door

RETT
Ain’t gonna hurt you Your girls
will make you feel better Give
you kisses And such Sugar

Rett opens the door DRAGS Milk outside into the late
afternoon glare and closes the door behind him

Lander looks up to see ALL SIX BITCHES padding toward him

LANDER
(mind-snapped)
Lacey Tulip Ella You’re my
girls You’re my good girls
PLEASE BE MY GOOD GIRLS

The dogs pad closer leaving behind a TRAIL of BLOODY
PAWPRINTS across the plastic sheeting

INTEXT THE FARM - MOMENTS LATER

MILK lies in the dirt bleeding moaning while Rett binds
his hands and feet with duct tape

MILK
Ohhhh (beat) oh

From inside the METAL SHED behind them there are muffled
terrible HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanating from within

Hearing this Milk WEEPS pathetically sniffling BLOOD
through his destroyed nose

MILK
(miserable)
Oh Jesus Oh fuck

Rett finishes with the duct tape pats Milk sweetly on the
forehead He SINGS a few lines of a children’s song

RETT
It’s alright to ecrycrying gets
the sad out of you

Rett walks over to the larger metal Structure Goes inside
finds his CLOTHES scattered on the floor scoops them up with
his hands which are now SHAKING uncontrollably
But he keeps on SINGING
RETT
Raindrops from your eyeswashing
all the mad out of you

A CRAMP suddenly doubles him over but he recovers staggers
over to the METH KITCHEN

There’s a large metal cabinet secured by a PADLOCK

Dazed an automaton Rett pulls out the PISTOL aims it at
the lock and BLAM-BLAM he SHOOTS it off

He swings open the door And stares blankly at the CONTENTS
TWO HUNDRED BRICKS of NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED JUNK

PILES and PILES of rubber-banded CASH

EXT THE FARM - MINUTES LATER

Rett emerges from the Kitchen Building now in his street
clothes lugging TWO BULGING GARBAGE BAGS over his shoulders

He walks over to Milk sets down the garbage bags and
crouches next to the ugly duct-taped Fuck who has curled
into a fetal ball his blood leaking into the dirt

Rett digs a piece of PAPER from his pocket where some WORDS
are scrawled But we cannot see what is written

RETT
Gonna go now Taking your shit
with me And your money

Milk MOANS pathetically

RETT
Don’t worry You’ll get free
sooner or later And when you do
you can call the Boss Not the one
in the shed getting eaten I mean
the Boss on the other end Cesar

Rett lays the paper in the dirt beside Milk Rett WINCES
seized by another awful CRAMP

RETT
(gritted teeth)
You tell him He wants what’s his
he can come on up and get it
Everything he needs to know Right
there on that piece of paper
(beat) Tell me you understand

Milk spits blood into the dirt
MILK

(a croak)
Fuck you

RETT
Good enough

Rett heaves the bags over his shoulders sets off down the
dirt track toward the road

Starts to SHIVER and STAGGERS unable to catch his breath

But he keeps on walking Doesn’t look back

EXT FOOTHILLS - SUNSET

Rett sits behind the wheel of his truck Shaking so hard
it’s like he’s having a seizure

He looks at himself in the rear view His eyes Red-rimmed
chemical-blasted feral A monster he doesn’t recognize

RETT
Oh God Fuck--

He opens the door staggers out falls to his hands and
knees and PUKES explosively Over and over Heaving
GASPING tears streaming down his bloodied face

RETT
Oh God Billy--

SMASH TO

EXT CARLA’S PLACE - PORCH - NIGHT
Carla opens the door and her eyes go WIDE--

CARLA
Holy shit--

RETT is slumped in the doorframe ghostly-white sweating
SHAKING and BLEEDING through his clothes

RETT
I’m F-f-fucked up C-C-Carlaaa

Like a flipped switch Carla goes INSTANTLY into business
mode She pulls him gently but firmly inside

CARLA
It’s okay I got you I got you

ALFONSO is standing inside looking absolutely FREAKED

CARLA
Get my bag baby Get it QUICK--

Rett’s bloodshot eyes land on the boy and he tries to smile

RETT
FonsoheySport

Rett’s eyes roll back and he CRUMPLES to the carpet

cuT TO BLACK

EXT LONESOME ROADWAY - NIGHT

Through the coal-black DARKNESS the tiny dots of HEADLIGHTS
approach from far far away

They come closer closer until their glow FILLS THE SCREEN
with LIGHT and as they PASS BY--

The SOUND of a MAN SIGHING deeply with satisfaction like
the weight of the world has been LIFTED--

And then the HEADLIGHTS have PASSED and the light FADES
quickly the blackness steadily encroaching until everything
is BLACK again dense and impenetrable--
INT CARLA’S PLACE - LIVING ROOM - SOME UNGODLY HOUR
Rett lies on the couch unconscious sweating His HEAD is
BANDAGED as well as his ARM and a square of GAUZE covers
the puncture in his NECK
Rett’s eyes slowly OPEN He STIRS
Carla rises from the armchair crouches beside him
He stares at her SHAPE Slowly she comes into FOCUS

RETT

(a croak)
It’s you Carla

Gently carefully she checks his bandages

CARLA
Expecting someone else

RETT
Look pretty

Carla smiles ruefully shakes her head

CARLA
Yeah I’m a goddamn beauty queen

RETT
Fonso

CARLA
He’s sleeping Finally

RETT
Sorry (beat) What time is it

CARLA
Don’t worry about that

Rett stares at her dreamily as she tends to him

RETT
Did you Fix me

Carla regards him tenderly strokes his hair

CARLA
Cleaned you up Pumped you full of
antibiotics because you know
Better safe than sorry (beat)
Sewing your ear back together that
was interesting First time for

He reaches for her hand Gently engulfs her small delicate
fingers within his large meaty paw

RETT
Angel

She looks into his eyes A cloud passes over her expression

CARLA
I’m not You don’t know

RETT
I know what I know

She moves closer to him
CARLA

What happened to you Who did this

RETT
It was just Just business

CARLA

Rett closes his eyes Shivers a bit

CARLA
Tell me what happened

RETT
Bad doggies

Tears spill from Carla’s eyes

CARLA
When you came to the door Your
eyes There was death in your eyes
and I got so scared I didn’t want
you to die

He pulls her toward him Their faces are now so close they
can taste each other’s breath

RETT
Wouldn’t mind dying Right here
Carla Just like this

CARLA
Don’t even know you hardly at all
Rett Why does it kill me so much
when you say my name

RETT
Because

They kiss Softly at first then with more urgency

He kisses his way down her neck His hands find her breasts
She moans losing herself in it Their breath quickens

She pulls back her eyes swimming with desire

CARLA
Not here

She takes his hand gingerly helps him off the couch

INT CARLA’S PLACE - BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

As light creeps into the sky outside Carla and Rett make
love She moves gracefully astride him careful to mind his
wounds and bruises Their eyes locked together

It’s obvious neither has felt this kind of pleasure in years
and years Perhaps even their whole lives

She grinds down onto him and he momentarily WINCES half
pain half pleasure--

CARLA
Sorry--

RETT
No its good It’s good--

He pulls her down kisses her She clings to him Their
movements increase in intensity They don’t stop kissing

FADE TO BLACK

INT CARLA’S BEDROOM - DAWN
Rett watches Carla sleep
He cups one of her breasts puts his mouth over her nipple

She stirs opens her eyes smiles at him Her fingers run up
his chest tease the edges of his head bandage

CARLA
Hi

RETT
Howdy

As he stares at her his expression becomes serious

RETT
Wanna tell you something Just
something I gotta say and I don’t
know how it’s gonna come out

Carla reacts her eyes widen glisten

CARLA
Oh (beat) That’s

RETT
They investigated The cops And

Carla gathers the sheets around herself stunned

RETT
But now I know a few things the
cops don’t know And I’m not gonna

CARLA
What kind of things

Rett’s eyes blaze as he speaks Everything he’s kept inside
far too long

RETT
Billy was involved in something
Bad stuff Running garbage With
his car I gave hima car for his
birthday Because that’s what you
do But the trouble got worse I
don’t know what happened He went
to visit his mother It was
Christmas Last year He never
got there Carla He never got
there because someone killed him
Shot him through the heart And
then took his car And left him in
a field off the 101 freeway

Carla is now sitting up in bed staring at him with wide
haunted eyes as tears fall down her cheeks

CARLA
Why didn’t you tell me before
RETT
Because (beat) Because the car
you’re driving (beat) It’s
Billy’s car Carla

She just stares at him

CARLA

Rett comes up behind her kisses her neck

He turns her around so he can look at her face

RETT
Carla This is happening Cesar’s

She stares at him Her eyes are filled with fear

CARLA
Rett

He kisses her softly

RETT
You gotta trust me

He kisses her again She stands there lets him Doesn’t
kiss him back

He walks silently out of the room

Carla stands there Closes her eyes Doesn’t breathe

INT JAMESON and SON AUTO - DAY

A bandaged Rett is in the office with a tall SILVER-HAIRED
MAN 59 going over a thick set of DOCUMENTS

With a melancholy but resigned expression Rett signs his
name again and again

He looks up and sees MOY standing in the doorway having just
arrived for the day He holds the BOWLING BAG jaw clenched

RETT
Hey Moy This here’s Jerry
Ruttledge Jerry this is Moy
Best mechanic on the Central Coast

RUTTLEDGE
Pleased to meetcha Moy

Moy glares at Ruttledge Then turns back to Rett

MOY
Fuck you Boss

He drops the bowling bag on the ground Spits to the side
Then walks out without saying another word

Ruttledge frowns taken aback Rett just looks terribly sad

EXT CHALK MOUNTAIN PARK - NIGHT

Rett’s truck is parked deep in the brush of the abandoned
park the HEADLIGHTS illuminating a small clearing at the
base of a mottled Evergreen

Rett is in the clearing with a shovel digging a 4-foot-wide
HOLE in the cold hard ground

INT CARLA’S PLACE - NIGHT

Carla paces around her place wringing her hands looking
harried and overwrought

She lights a cigarette smokes over the sink

cut TO BLACK

EXT CHALK MOUNTAIN PARK - NIGHT

The abandoned park is dark as a mine shaft No stars no
moon to cast a light

Only the looming shadows of the surrounding hills and the
sound of WIND through the trees

A pair of HEADLIGHTS approach in the distance Slowly reveal
the shape of a BLACK ESCALADE bumping along the rutted TRACK
that weaves through the vast empty ACREAGE of the park

The Escalade stops at a rotting wooden FENCE where the track
abruptly ends and spreads into network of TRAILS that weave
through the hills and dense trees

The doors POP OPEN and TWO DUDES emerge from the Escalade
pulling up the collars of their coats against the cold

Both of them thickly-built LATINS early 30s one with a
SHAVED HEAD the other with PIERCED LIPS and EYEBROWS

They trudge past the fence and down the rocky trail eyeing
their surroundings which is impossible because everything
is a blanket of DARKNESS

And then a VOICE from the darkness

RETT’S VOICE (0S)
You can stop right there fellas

The two dudes STOP instinctively reach into their COATS
eyes DARTING but the blackness is disorienting difficult to
tell where the voice came from
RETT’S VOICE (0S)
Whatever youre reaching for I’d
suggest you toss that shit

The dudes each pull out a thick chunky GLOCK but they don’t
toss them They let them dangle twitching itchy

SHAVED calls out to the darkness

SHAVED
Why you gotta hide like a bitch

Rett’s VOICE from the darkness again from a DIFFERENT spot

RETT’S VOICE (0S)
I won’t ask again

PIERCED turns to SHAVED whispers low

PIERCED
Don’t do it He ain’t got shit--

BLAM BLAM FLASHES from the DARKNESS--
TWO ROUNDS BLAST INTO THE DIRT INCHES from their FEET

SHAVED
FUCK Wait Hold up yo

The dudes toss their Glocks into the woods

RETT’S VOICE (0S)
Thank you kindly

THUNK A thick roll of DUCT TAPE arcs out of the darkness
and lands at their feet The guys stare at it jittery

RETT’S VOICE (0S)

You With the metal in your face
Do me a favor and tape Cue-bail’s
hands together

Pierced does as he’s told

RETT’S VOICE (0S)
Get him on his belly Then you can
go ahead and tape his ankles

Pierced obeys goes to work on Shaved’s ankles

Only when Pierced is finished does Rett finally EMERGE from
the DARKNESS pointing MILK’S 9MM

RETT
(to Pierced)
Now you Get on your knees

PIERCED
Where’s all the shit

RETT
It’s close by Get on your knees

PIERCED
I wanna see it

RETT
You won’t see a goddamn thing until
I see Cesar’s face

PIERCED
The fuck you know I ain’t him

With one swift movement Rett KICKS Pierced’s legs out from
under him-- Pierced CRUMPLES onto his BACK-- and in a split
second Rett’s got his KNEE in his CHEST shoving the 9MM’s
MUZZLE into his NOSTRILS

RETT
Because you got no brains Got no
heart Because if you were him
you wouldn’t toss your shit like a
chico You’d stand your ground
like aman Stop wasting my time
and tell me where the fuck he is

PIERCED
Okay yo Okay Let’s just cool
this shit down

Rett starts BINDING his HANDS and FEET with the duct tape

PIERCED
Supposed to call When I seen the
shit

Rett drags Pierced over next to Shaved flips him over onto
his stomach and starts taping the two men TOGETHER

SHAVED
This ain’t necessary bra

Rett digs through Pierced’s coat until he finds a CELL PHONE

RETT
I’m guessing you got this asshole
on speed dial

But then ANOTHER CELL PHONE starts ringing Coming from
inside Rett’s COAT

Rett frowns walks a distance away down the trail jams
Pierced’s phone into his pocket pulls out his own cell

On the DISPLAY it says CARLA

RETT
Carla What’s going--

Carla’s VOICE is FRANTIC PANICKED and INSANE--

CARLA’S VOICE
Oh my God Rett please help me it’s
Alfonso I think he took something

RETT
Wait Hold on Slow down what

CARLA’S VOICE
He won’t BREATHE Oh my god he’s

Rett PACES drags a shaking hand through his hair--

RETT
Shit Fuck Did you call 911--

CARLA’S VOICE

Rett starts RUNNING up the trail
RETT
Listen to me It’s gonna be okay
I’ll be there in five minutes You

CARLA’S VOICE
I DON’T FUCKING KNOW WHAT TO DO
OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD
Rett SPRINTS PAST the TWO BOUND MEN on the TRAIL--

SHAVED

PIERCED
Fuckin COLD out in this bitch--

But Rett doesn’t even hear them just keeps RUNNING--

INTEXT CARLA’S DOUBLE-WIDE - NIGHT

Rett’s truck SCREECHES to a halt outside he jumps out
sprints up the stairs to the porch YANKS open the DOOR--

He rushes inside sees Carla sitting at the dinette with a
blank strange look on her face

RETT
Where is he Where’s Alfonso

Carla looks at him her face WHITE silently opens her mouth

RETT
Carla Where is he

Carla stares at him with a hollowed-out expression

She MOUTHS the wordsI’m Sorry

On instinct alone Rett REACHES INTO HIS COAT FOR HIS PIECE--
And that’s when a STUN GUN is JAMMED into his LOWER BACK--
LZEZLZLZLZLLELLL2L2L2L2LaT

700000 VOLTS SURGE THROUGH RETT’S BODY He CRUMPLES to the
floor DAZED FLOPPING and SEIZING

A deep soft BUTTERY VOICE comes from 0S--

VOICE
Do him again

The STUN GUN is jammed into Rett’s ABDOMEN
4ELLZELZ2ZLZLZLL2ZLZ2ZL22L2T
Rett FLOPS and SCREAMS spit FROTHS from his mouth

Finally he’s RELEASED and he curls into a ball gasping from
the assault eyes twitching

His eyes flick to the LIVING ROOM where a tall elegantly-
dressed OLIVE-SKINNED MAN is standing CESAR

About 45 years old Close-cropped ink-black hair Full
beard flecked with silver Arm draped around the shoulder
of ALFONSO who stares at Rett with wide terrified eyes

CESAR
Look at your man Carla Pissed
himself like a shorty

Indeed a dark STAIN spreads over the front of Rett’s jeans

CESAR
(to Rett)
Hope you don’t mind my asking But
how long you been fucking my wife

The STUN GUN SPARKS inches from Rett’s face His eyes
follow the stun gun to the HUGE MAN holding it

DOSA is about 300 pounds ugly as fuck acne-scarred face
dead-black pinprick eyes

DOSA
He ask you a question booka

Rett tries to catch his breath Notices that he’s BLEEDING
through his bandages a result of the violent shocks

RETT
(to Alfonso)
You okay buddy
Alfonso shakes his head NO Cesar’s expression goes dark

CESAR
Please don’t speak to my son

Rett ignores Cesar tries to give Alfonso a smile

Cesar

THREE
GRINS

Cesar

RETT
Gonna be alright Don’t be scared

strides over and KICKS RETT IN THE GUT And AGAIN

CARLA
STOP IT

TIMES FOUR TIMES But even through the pain Rett
DEFIANTLY at Cesar his teeth full of BLOOD

RETT
CAN’T HURT ME YOU GREASY FUCK

stares at Rett can’t help being a little impressed

He crouches beside him speaks softly

INT

CESAR
It’s like Karen Carpenter said
amigo We’ve only just begun

SILVER SUBURBAN - NIGHT

The huge Suburban rumbles smoothly through the night

DOSA is behind the wheel Cesar rides shotgun and a blank-
looking ALFONSO is sandwiched between them

In the back seat CARLA sits beside another THUG a baby-
faced TURKISH guy named KAAN who keeps watch over RETT who
is BOUND in the TAILGATE

A weeping Carla leans over the seat into the tailgate tries
to make eye contact with Rett but he doesn’t want any part

of it

stares out the window

CARLA
Rett Look at me

He won’t look at her

RETT
You’re really some actress

CARLA
I had to do it Didn’t have a
choice I was afraid

RETT
Afraid of what Me

CARLA
I had to protect Alfonso

RETT
Congratulations You did a bang-up
job with that shit Now the
Devil’s got him

Carla weeps shudders a total mess

CARLA
You don’t understand I couldn’t
let you--

RETT

CARLA

want you to hurt him--

RETT
What difference does it make How

Carla is crying so hard she can hardly breathe Drool spills
from her lip like she’s an infant

CARLA

pile of CRYSTALS The POWDER is then SIFTED into a larger
PILE which is sectioned off and BUSTED DOWN with other
powders into a less concentrated formula

CESAR (0S)
Of course busting wasn’t the only
service she was obliged to provide

A large HAND lands on her shoulder She turns and it’s KAAN
standing there grinning He cups one of her BREASTS

KAAN
(whispers )
Come with me little girlie

Jess’ eyes are WIDE and HELPLESS as she’s led away from the
table by Kaan She searches the other GIRLS’ FACES for help
but they all AVERT THEIR EYES

Kaan leads a crying Jess through a small DOOR--

And a SPLIT SECOND LATER the THUGS UNLOAD into the DARKNESS--
BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM B ——

As the SHOTS ECHO around the park Cesar SCOOPS UP Alfonso
and TAKES OFF RUNNING down the TRAIL--

Rett quickly SCURRIES OVER to where CARLA is crouched

FROZEN behind a large EVERGREEN FOOTSTEPS approach through
the brush It’s KAAN sweating Glock pointed outward

Silently Rett bends down and picks up a thick solid BRANCH
off the ground

Kaan moves closer amped freaked totally DISORIENTED

Rett GRIPS the branch Grits his teeth

Kaan EDGES past the TREE--

Rett SWINGS THE BRANCH with all the FORCE he can muster--

A sickening THUNK as the BRANCH COLLIDES with KAAN’S SKULL--
And he HITS the GROUND like a sack of nickels

Rett drops the branch panting grabs Kaan’s GLOCK off the
ground and SKITTERS down the hill eyes BLAZING--

cut TO

JORGENSEN

Hustling down the trail gripping the Mossberg

He moves off the trail picks his way down a steep
EMBANKMENT and FREEZES when he sees a pair of SILHOUETTES
hunched down next to a small burbling CREEK

He moves closer his movements MUFFLED by the NOISE of the
CREEK When he’s about ten feet away he can clearly see

that it’s CESAR clutching a trembling ALFONSO

CLACK-CLACK He RACKS the shotgun and Cesar looks up to see
the BARRELS pointed right at his face

JORGENSEN
Kid move away from that man

CESAR

JORGENSEN

RETT

Comes upon the CREEK and JORGENSEN lying face down
motionless no sign of the shotgun

RETT

He bends down to the Detective touches the shredded fabric
across his back where the ROUNDS ripped into him--

Jorgensen suddenly COUGHS and lets out a long GROAN

JORGENSEN
Uhhhhhhbhbhh

Rett quickly turns him over opens his coat revealing the
KEVLAR VEST he’s wearing underneath

RETT
Gonna be okay buddy

Jorgensen swats at Rett’s hands like he’s driving him away

JORGENSEN
(gasping)
The fuck outta here Now Get
that fuckin Piece of shit coward

Rett TAKES OFF up the trail following the CREEKBED Only
the sound of his BREATHING and the WIND in the barren TREES

Then up ahead he barely sees the OUTLINES of CESAR visibly
DRAGGING ALFONSO behind him they’re making a break for the
DIRT ROAD and the TRUCKS--

Rett picks up speed SPRINTS toward them--

Until he’s SUDDENLY TACKLED by 300 POUNDS of DOSA and the
two men SPLASH into the shallow CREEK with Dosa on TOP--

The water’s only about a FOOT DEEP but it’s deep enough for
Dosa to use his weight to FORCE RETT’S HEAD UNDERWATER

Rett THRASHES his eyes BUGGING as he struggles for AIR and
Dosa just SMILES bears down HARDER--

Rett’s HANDS SCRABBLE MADLY over Dosa’s torso trying to find
purchase something to grab onto but his STRUGGLES are
growing WEAKER by the second
DOSA

Nighty-night time maricon You

just let it come
Rett’s hand lethargically SLIDES INSIDE DOSA’S JACKET--
And COMES OUT WITH THE STUN-GUN

2LLLLLZLLZLLLLLLLELLaELooGaeET—-— Rett JAMS THE BUSINESS END right
into DOSA’S MOUTH SMASHING it against his TEETH--

Dosa CONVULSES SCREAMS and Rett receives SECONDARY SHOCKS
as he claws his way from underneath the huge man’s BULK--

But finally gets free and STAGGERS up the trail toward the
DIRT ROAD--

Up ahead Rett sees CESAR struggling up the path with one
hand gripping ALFONSO and the other gripping the TRASH BAG
full of CASH and JUNK

Rett quickly CLOSES the DISTANCE between them--

Cesar suddenly SPINS and DROPS THE BAG and he’s somehow got
the MOSSBERG aimed at RETT--

Rett DIVES into the brush as the BITCH goes BOO-YAH
SHREDDING the ground where Rett was just standing--

Cesar grabs the TRASH BAG continues up the path makes it
out to the DIRT ROAD and heads straight for the SUBURBAN

cut TO

RETT

Hurries up the trail hears the ENGINE of the SUBURBAN
starting up makes it to the DIRT ROAD--

BLAM BLAM CLICK A frazzed-looking DOSA is emerging from
the trail BLASTING AWAY at RETT

Rett HITS THE DECK and CRAWLS toward a STONE WALL as Dosa
STALKS CLOSER simultaneously EJECTING A CLIP and SNAPPING IN
a new one he’s almost RIGHT ON TOP OF RETT--—

Dosa SMILES and TAKES DEAD AIM--

The ROAR of an ENGINE and sudden BLINDING HEADLIGHTS--
Jorgensen’s UNMARKED CRUISER SLAMS FULL-SPEED INTO DOSA
driving him BACKWARDS and CRUSHING HIM up against the stone
wall with such FORCE that a thick jet of BLOOD ERUPTS from
his mouth and SPRAYS the WINDSHIELD

Stunned Rett staggers to the Cruiser rips open the door
finds CARLA behind the wheel dazed nose BROKEN and bloody

He gently pulls her from the car She’s trembling in SHOCK
and he CARRIES her over to a BOULDER leans her against it

RETT
You’re all right You’re all
right It’s okay
She looks at Rett miserably dazed full of shame regret

CARLA
It’s my fault Im sorry

RETT
It doesn’t matter

CARLA
I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry--

WHAM A BOOT connects with the side of Rett’s HEAD--

Carla SCREAMS as CESAR continues to KICK RETT mercilessly
She ATTACKS Cesar with a flurry of PUNCHES but he BACKHANDS
her to the ground reaches into his coat and pulls out

A BLACK 7-INCH KA-BAR COMBAT KNIFE

He KNEELS onto Rett’s chest leans CLOSE to his face PRESSES
the edge of the blade into Rett’s FOREHEAD

CESAR
Feel how sharp Flick you open
like butter puta

Rett is too dazed to struggle as the BLADE slowly SLICES DOWN
HIS FACE he just BLINKS MADLY as BLOOD FLOWS into his EYES--

CESAR
(whispers )
Gonna make you so ugly boy--

There’s a FERAL SCREAM as ALFONSO launches himself at Cesar
BASHING him in the head with a softball-sized ROCK--

Cesar TOPPLES from Rett the Ka-Bar SKITTERS across the DIRT--

Alfonso continues to HOWL and SMASH at Cesar with the rock
until Cesar gets ahold of the boy and PUNCHES him in the GUT

Alfonso GASPS with the pain doubles over coughs SOBS--

CARLA
YOU DON’T TOUCH HIM--

Carla is suddenly LUNGING AT CESAR with the KA-BAR she STABS
him in the SHOULDER YANKS it out--

CARLA
YOU DON’T--

And STABS HIM AGAIN in the BELLY and Cesar HOWLS in AGONY--

CESAR
Fucking WHORE--

She HAULS OUT the BLADE and BLOOD FLIES and goes to STAB HIM
AGAIN but Cesar GRABS HER ARMS and they WRESTLE MADLY for the
blade KICKING and PUNCHING and GOUGING--

Rett CRAWLS toward them teeth bared flicking the blood from
his eyes like SWEAT--

Carla and Cesar FIGHT LIKE ANIMALS and ALFONSO WATCHES
clutching his belly unable to speak or scream--

Cesar manages to CLAW his way on top of Carla he grips the
knife OVERHANDED about to STAB DOWN and he turns to lock
eyes with Alfonso grinning triumphantly

CESAR
YOU WATCH AND YOU SEE HOW A MAN DO

Alfonso COVERS HIS EYES He WILL NOT WATCH

Rett APPEARS BEHIND CESAR Bloody as ROAD-KILL

His hand shoots out and GRABS CESAR’S WRIST-- and with a
quick awful CRUNCHING TWIST he SNAPS IT BACKWARD then
FORWARD A dozen bones PULVERIZED in the space of a second
Cesar’s SCREAM is so high it’s a FALSETTO

Rett YANKS Cesar off of Carla still grasping him by his
destroyed wrist which dangles BONELESS like jelly--

CESAR
Please Lo siento--

Rett FLINGS him to the ground STRADDLES his chest--
RETT
Never pull a Ka-Bar on a Marine

you stupid piece of garbage

With a GRUNT Rett PLUNGES the KA-BAR right through Cesar’s
SOLAR PLEXUS all the way to the HILT

Cesar’s mouth DROPS OPEN his breath HISSING out like air
leaking from a tire his eyes WIDE in SHOCK

Rett leans close to him WHISPERS into his face

RETT
I can feel your heart stopping

Cesar STARES at Rett In disbelief In awe
And he DIES

RETT
Balls before brains maricon

The sound of DISTANT SIRENS approaching

Rett crawls over to CARLA touches her tenderly She tries
to speak but can only manage the tiniest WHISPER--

CARLA
Rett

RETT
Don’t talk You’re gonna be okay
Help is coming

She shakes her head Tears leak from her eyes

CARLA
Youre all he has now Rett

RETT
You’re okay You’re here

Rett presses his hands down her body examining and she
WINCES He pulls away the fabric of her shirt sees the
awful PULSING KNIFE WOUND between her breasts
RETT
(pure dread)
Oh no

He PRESSES his hand against the wound trying to stop the
blood but it COURSES between his fingers--

Carla pulls Rett closer whispers--

CARLA
Rett Have to Forgive him
