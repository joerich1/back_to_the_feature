-watching Mr Angier drown in a tank

PROSECUTOR
Would you describe your occupation

CUTTER
Im an ingeneur I design illusions
and construct the apparatus necessary
for perfoming them

PROSECUTOR
And for how long had you been
MrAngiers ingeneur

CUTTER
Eight years I was privvy to the
secrets of his entire act

PROSECUTOR
So MrCutter was this water-filled
tank beneath the stage part of
MrAngiers illusion- the illusion
billed as THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN

CUTTER
No sir The tank had been used for
the first trick then taken offstage
Borden must have put it under the
trap door after the interval

Cutter looks across at Borden who is absently tapping his
hand against the rail- it is MUTILATED MISSING 2 12 FINGERS
The DEFENDER STANDS

DEFENDER
How large was this tank

CUTTER
The sort of tank used for underwater
escapes- four or five hundred gallons
DEFENDER
How do you think MrBorden was able
to move the tank under the trap door
without anyone noticing

CUTTER
Ask him- hes the magician

Titters from the gallery The Defenser turns to the JUDGE

DEFENDER
(impatient)
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of MrAngiers illusion

CUTTER

(angry)
If I reveal my magicians secrets
here in open court Ill be
unemployable and the secrets will be
worthless The Real Transported Man
is the most sought-after illusion in
the business and I have te right to
sell it on

The Judge considers this He looks at Cutter Sympathetic

JUDGE
MrCutter I see your predicament
but we are talking about a capital
offence- Alfred Bordens life hangs
in the balance

Cutter looks down Quiet

JUDGE (CONTD)

If you were prepared to disclose the
details to me in private I might be
able to judge their relevance to the
case

(addresses lawyers)
Might this be an acceptable
compromisse

Amid murmurs of assent the Judge ADJOURNS the proceedings

As the Guards begin the complex ritual of unlocking Bordens

Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet
They walk along a hall wrought iron fence The PRISON looms

OWENS (CONTD)

Im offering you a way to warp up
your affairs with dignity and Im
offering your daughter a future As
Lord Caldlows ward she will want

Think it over
Borden absently VANISHES the card as a REFLEX

OWENS (CONTD)
Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this-
(produces a leather
bound JOURNAL)
As a show of good faith He thought
it might be of interest

A SULLEN WALDER TALKS the journal flicks through it

OWENS (CONTD)

the time he spent in Colorado learning
your trick

Sullen hands the journal to Borden Borden takes it

BORDEN
Angier never learned my trick

OWENS

Colorado he mounted a version of the
Transported Man that the papers said
was better even
(with relish)
Than your original

BORDEN
(acid)

dig him up and ask him for yourself

Milton gesticulates in the wings Cutter signals to a
stagehand who starts HOISTING Julia into the air

The lightning lives here And noit
much else- our work is secret

Alley glances down at the notebook and Agiers scribbles

ALLEY (CONTD)
A cypher

Angier nods as Alley lifts the cardboard notebook

ANGIER
My profession also deals in secrets

Alley looks at the gibberish on the pages of the notebook

ANGIER (CONTD)
Its a rotating transposition that
shifts every day of the dairy Simple
but time-consuming to translate once

ALLEY
Which is

Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook
ANGIER
We magicians have a circle of trust

ALLEY
You have a circle of trust with
someone whose dairy you stole

Its how we pay for our retirements
and how greats tricks outlive us

Alley considers this Taps the cover of the notebook

The field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT Angier
laughs out in surprise- the field is full of a thousand large
LIGHTBULBS all glowing together Alley bends down and picks
up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does the light in it
extinguises He tosses the bulb to Angier Except for the
size its a normal lightbulb

ANGIER
Where are the wires

ALLEY
Exactly

Angier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random
spot in the wet soil The lightbulb FLICKERS on again

ANGIER
Wheres the generator

INT ANGIERS WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

A NEWSPAPER on the makeup table Angier sits at the mirror

He hubs BROWN PASTE into his hair and then combs it out
Then he chooses a beard seats it on his chin and begins to
adjust it He drops the BOTTLE of spirit gum as he looks in
the mirror and sees OLIVIA standing behind him

ANGIER
(embarrassed)
I thought youd gone

Olivia shifts Embarrassed
OLIVIA
I dont really have anywhere to

go
Angier slips the newspaper from the table

ANGIER
Youve been sleeping here

OLIVIA
Cutter said it would be okay till we
get another booking
(beat )
What are you doing

ANGIER
Researching Part of a magicians
job is to watch his competition to
see what illusions theyre-

OLIVIA
Youre going to do something to that
man arent you

Olivia moves closer Angier is quiet

OLIVIA (CONTD)
Cutters hopig youll let things
life He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you then we can-

ANGIER

Even My wife for a couple of his
fingers He has a child now And
hes perfoming again

(bitter )
Borden is out there living his life
just as he always intended As if
nothing had happened And look at

touch me

OLIVIA

Olivia moves towards him
OLIVIA (CONTD)
Youre going to need a better
disguise
Olivia reaches for Angiers beard
INT TINY GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier almost unrecognizanle as a blonde slips into the

back of the theatre which is as rough and unwelcoming as
Bordens last venue

On the small raised stage Borden works through his way
through the Chinese rings with GLOVED HANDS to hide his
damaged fingers The tough crowd is JEERING AT HIM

Borden puts the rings down on a table and PICKS UP a bag

BORDEN
I need a volunteer

Angier takes a few steps towards the stage
Borden produces a RUBBER BALL
he TOSSES the ball to Angier

BORDEN (CONTD)
As you can see its just a rubber
ball But its not normal at all

Angier examines the ball Hands it back to Borden who shows
no sign of recognizing Angier

BORDEN (CONTD)
Thank you

Angier notices that two TALL BLACK CABINETS are standing
twenty feet apart on the stage

BORDEN (CONTD)
(to audience)
Youre not impressed

Borden BOUNCES the BALL on the ground and catches it

BORDEN (CONTD)
Its a magic ball

Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor The
audience looks bored waiting for something to happen

OLIVIA (VO)
What happened

INT ANGIERS WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

Angier still in disguise is slumped in an armchair drink
in hand He is SMILING remembering

Olivia sitting on the workbench waits for him to continue

OLIVIA
What happened Robert

ANGIER
He had a new trick

OLIVIA
Was it good

Angier looks at her
INT TINY GRUBBY THEATRE -- EVENING

Now its CUTTER standing in the audience watching Onstage
Borden BOUNCES the ball over and over again

ANGIER (VO)
It was the greatest magic trick I
have ever seen

Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to
one of the cabinets Its empty He CLOSES it again and
crosses the stage BOUNCING the ball the whole way

At the far cabinet Borden repeats the process OPENING the
door to the empty cabinet This time however he leaves
the door open

He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS across
the stage

Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him CLOSING the door
With no one on stage the audience watches as the ball
continues to BOUNCE across the stage BOUNCE BOUNCE
BOUNCE The ball loses seep and height

Just as reaches the second cabinet something IMPOSSIBLE
happens

THE DOOR TO THE SECOND CABINET OPENS AND BORDEN STEPS OUT
CATCHING THE BALL

Cutter FLINCHES then studies Borden The audience is
BEMUSED Finally a trickle of applause

INT ANGIERS WORKSHOP -- DAY
Angier is talking to Cutter Olivia is watching

ANGIER
Did they applaud when you saw it

CUTTER
Not very enthusiastically

INT TINY GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier is disguise starts CLAPPING loudly FIRMLY as if he
cant help it LEADING the applause

Borden BOUNCES the ball once again then BOWS deeply The
APPLAUSE peters out Borden walks off the stage

INT ANGIERS WORKSHOP -- DAY

Angier turns to Cutter
They both

CUTTER
The trick is too good -- too simple-
the audience harly knows what theyve
seen

ANGIER
Hes a dreadful magician

CUTTER
Hes a wonderfull magician- hes a
dreadful showman He doesnt know
how to dress it up how to sell the
trick

ANGIER
How does he do it

CUTTER
He uses a double

ANGIER
(shakes head)
Its not that simple This isa
complex illusion

CUTTER
You think that because you dont
know the method Its a double who
comes out at the end Its the only
way

ANGIER
Ive seen his perfom ir three times
now Mr Cutter- the Prestige is the
same man-

CUTTER
Its not-

ANGIER
The same man comes out of the second
cabinet I promise you

OLIVIA

It is the same man
turn to look at Olivia

OLIVIA (CONTD)
He wears padded gloves to hide his
damaged fingers but if you look
closely you can tell

Angier looks at Cutter

ANGIER
He doesnt know how to sell his trick
to an audience But I do

CUTTER
(nods )
It would give us our climax

ANGIER

The man stole my life Im going to
steal his trick

CUTTER

Well have to find someone who can
look like you on a stage

ANGIER
He doesnt use a double-

CUTTER
(impacient )
I dont know how Borden does it
Robert So either you wait for Borden
to retire and buy his secret or you
can listen to how I would do this
trick

(Angier nods)
Ang the only way I know is to find
you a bloody good double
Angier smiles Turns to Olivia pointing to his face
ANGIER
Take a good look- lets get out
there and find me
EXT ROAD PIKES PEAK -- MORNING
Angier swinging his cane walks slowly up the mountain road

EXT TESLAS LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS

The lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical
DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower

Angier stops fearful

ALLEY
Its perfectly safe

As Angier stares a MAN begins to emerge from the very center
of the CONFLAGRATION

Bolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks in SILHOUETTE
towards Angier

TESLA
So this is the Great Danton

Tesla emerges from the ball of electricity dressed as if he
were on his way to the opera He brushes SPARKS from the
sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier

TESLA (CONTD)
Mr Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions
Something you did with pockets

Angier returns the handshake

ANGIER
I saw a lecture you gave in London
several years ago Im flattered
you agreed to see me

Tesla keeps hold as Angiers hand

Angier confused does so Alley hands him a lightbulb
which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base

ANGIER (CONTD)
Whats conducting the electricity

TESLA
Our bodies Mr Angier are quite
capable of conducting and indeed
producing energy

Tesla release Angiers hand The bulb goes out Alley takes
it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands

TESLA (CONTD)
Have you eaten Mr Angier

EXT DECK LABORATORY -- MORNING

Angier Alley and Tesla are seated around a table on a decl
overlooking a spectacular view They are eating sandwiches

TESLA
Alley has explained that you require
a very interesting device

ANGIER
I need something impossible

TESLA
Youre familiar with a phrase Mans
reach exceeds his grasp

(MORE )

TESLA (CONTD)
(off his look)
Its a lie Mans grasp exceeds his
nerve The only limits on scientific
progress are these imposed by society

Tesla looks out at the mountains

TESLA (CONTD)

The first time I changed the world I
was hailed as a visionary The second
time I was asked politely to retire
The world only tolerates one change
at a time And so here I am

(gestures at laboratory)
Enjoying retirement

(looking at Angier)
Nothing is impossible Mr Angier
What you want is simply expensive

Tesla rises washing his hands in a basin on a side table

TESLA (CONTD)
Alley says you are a stage magician
If a built you this device you would
be presenting it only as an illusion

ANGIER
If people thought the things I did
on stage were real they wouldnt
clap- theyd scream Think of saving
a woman in half

Tesla nods Considering

TESLA
MrAngier the cost of such a machine-

ANGIER
Price is not an object

TESLA
Perhaps not But have you considered
the cost

ANGIER
Im noit sure I follow

TESLA

I can make your machine Mr Angier
But I can also give you some advice

(pointed)
Go home Forget this thing I can
recognize an obsession As Mr Alley
could tell you I myself an given to
one now and then It will not do
you any good
ANGIER
Have your obsessions done you no
good

TESLA

At first But Ive followed them
too long- I am their slave Their
whipping boy And one day they may
choose to destroy me

Angier looks into Teslas eyes

ANGIER
if you understand an obsession then
you know you wont change my mind

TESLA
(smiles )
So be it

ANGIER
Will you build it

TESLA
I have already begun to build it
Mr Angier I hope you enjoy the
mountain air This will take time
Tesla disappears into the lab

INT GREEN ROOM DRINKING CLUB -- EVENING

The club is warm and dark Olivia Cutter and Angier make

their way to the bar Olivia points to the far end of the

bar to a TRAMP in tattered clothing curled over a pint

OLIVIA

Gerry

The tramp sees Olivia hoists himself up and spills his way
down the bar to them As he draws closer we understand why

Olivia has brought them here

Underneath the filth and matted hair this man is SPITTING

IMAGE of Robert Angier- HE IS PLAYED BY THE SAME ACTOR

OLIVIA (CONTD)
Mr Angier Mr Cutter I would like
you to meet Mr Gerald Root

ROOT
A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen

Angier is staring a little too much Root throws an ARM
over Angiers shoulder and draws him in

ROOT (CONTD)
(whisper )
Would you like for me to tell you a
little joke

Angier smiles unconfortably Sunddely Root WRAPS this hands
around Angiers neck and begins to THROTTLE him

Cutter breaks it up and pushes Root back

ROOT (CONTD)
(yelling)
Are you laughing

Angier is shaken Root picks up his hat off the bar and
disappears onto the street

ANGIER
Hes out of his mind

OLIVIA
Hes an out-of-work actor- of course
hes out of his mind

CUTTER
Hes perfect A little work mind
you but when Im done with him he
could be your brother

ANGIER
I dont need him to be my brother
I need him to be me

EXT NORTH HILL -- DAY

Borden escorts Sarah and their TODDLER a girl up the three

Borden reaches up and pushes a wayward LOCK a her hair over
her ear When his hands returns its holding a KEY

He stands places the key in Sarahs hand

SARAH
What is this for

Borden takes her gently by the shoulders and turns her around
until shes facing a modest two-story HOUSE She looks down
at the key in her hand
SARAH (CONTD)

BORDEN
You caught me in the wrong mood

SARAH
But you want through all the-

BORDEN

Sarah turns and embraces her husband

INT EMPIRE THEATRE

The auditoruim is empty Two doors is simple frames have
been erected in the middle of the stage Angier fiddles
with one opening it walking through it Olivia is watching

OLIVIA
You walk through this one- then

Angier stands Olivia in front of the door

he pushes the door all way open Suddenly a TRAP-DOOR set

into the floor POPS open Angier JUMPS through it-

She gestures at a LIFT twenty feet away with a TRAP DOOR
MECHANISM above it Angier nods Olivia looks at Angier

OLIVIA (CONTD)
Its going to be amazing Robert

ANGIER

Angier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door
INT EMPIRE THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER

Angier and Olivia sit in the front row Cutter beckons Root
onstage Hes been clened up and dressed in Angiers stage
costume he TRIPS on his way across the stage

ANGIER
All I have to do is keep myself
stinking drunk all the time and no
one will be able to tell the
difference

CUTTER
A little faith sir Could you favor
us with a perfomance Mr Root

Root picks himself up and dusts himself off

Suddenly ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER he is channeling everything
from his facial expressions to his walk Angier nods

starting to believe this might work The illusion is PERFECT --
till he opens his mouth

ROOT
You would drink too if you know
the world half so well as I do

Angier hops up onto stage examining Root from different
angles Root starts APING his every movement Olivia starts
laughing Angier is getting uncomfortable

ROOT (CONTD)
Did you think you were unique Mr
Angier I have been Cassar I have
been Faust How difficult could it
possibly be to play The Great
Danton

CUTTER
You can go back to being yourself
Root For free

Root looks challengingly at both men

ROOT
Id rather be him for now I find
it amusing

Root WAVES his hands across his chest in the same manner
that Angier does onstage He produces a bottle of Gin from
thin air and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia

CUTTER
Root has to keep a low profile--
anyone sees him the games up

ANGIER

(watching Root)
I dont know how you do these things
Cutter Im not sure I want to know

CUTTER
Have you thought about what we should
call the trick
ANGIER
No point being coy Borden calls
his trick The Transported Man
Cutter nods

BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses
them to the crowd APPLAUSE fills the theatre

The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage
Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the
audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor

ANGIER
Ladies and gentlemen much of what
youve seen tonight can be termed
illusions Entertaining trifles of
the sort you may have seen other
magicians perform

Angier puts on a TOP HAT

ANGIER (CONTD)
Alas I cannot claim this next feat
as illusion Watch carefully- you
will see no trickery for no trickery
is being employed Merely a techique
familiar to certain citizens of the
orient and various holy men of the
Himalyas Indeed some of you may
be familiar with this technique but
for those of you who arent do not
be alarmed what you are about to
see is considered safe

Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand
door opens it SLAPS it to show that is sold

Then strolls through crossing the stage-

-to the other door which he opens SLAPPING to show its
solidity then walking trough the frame

Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air
It sails back down to him and he catches it

Angier THROWS the HAT again even harder this time and it
disappears uo into the rafters After a beat it is clear
its not coming back down

LAUGHTER Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped
back down to him He catches it

Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH
ARC across the stage He OPENS the door- steps behind it

The second DOOR FAR ACROSS THE STAGE IMMEDIATELY opens and
ANGIERROOT EMERGES REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT

BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him He puts on the hat

INT DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING

Angier Olivia and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess
Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table

OLIVIA
(toast)
To our achivement

They drink

CUTTER
The manager said hes never seen a
reaction like it

Angier smiles rueful

ANGIER
At least he got to see it I spent
the ovation hidden under the stage
No one cares about the man who
disappears the man who goes into
the box They care about the man
who comes out the other side

OLIVIA
I care about the man in the box

Angier turns to Olivia raises his glass

ANGIER
Thank you
(to Cutter)
Maybe we could switch before the
trick That way I could be the
Prestige and Root ends up below stage

CUTTER
(shakes head)
The antecipation of the trick is
everything- it needs your showmanship
to built suspense If Root opens
his mouth its all over- he cant
introduce the trick

ROOT (0S)
of course I can Im the Great
Danton

They turn Root is lying behind a trunk still in costume

CUTTER
Root you bloody fool get that
costume and makeup off right now
anyone could walk in here

Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet He grabs his collar
and turns to Angier and Olivia
CUTTER (CONTD)
Congratulation all

Cutter DRAGS Root out Olivia slides onto the makeup table

ANGIER

I suppose I should get more rest
OLIVIA

Life is not full of these moments

Robbie
Olivia pours him some more champagne
OLIVIA (CONTD)
Weve worked hard for this and we
need to celebrate properly
Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile
in closer and they KISS She wraps her legs
They kiss again
Angier pulls back
OLIVIA (CONTD)
Whats wrong
(softly)
It is your wife

Angier shakes his head distracted

ANGIER
The trick isnt good enough

Olivia stares at him

She pulls him
around him

OLIVIA

Didnt you see the audience
ANGIER

No
OLIVIA

Well they loved it
ANGIER

Its not as good as his trick
OLIVIA

Bordens trick is nothing compared

to ours He doesnt have any style-
ANGIER

He doesnt have to spend the finale
hiding under the stage

Angier rises turning out of her embrace
ANGIER (CONTD)
I need to know how he does it

OLIVIA
Why

ANGIER
So that I can do it better

Angier turns to her Looks her in the eye

ANGIER (CONTD)
I need you to go and work for him

OLIVIA
Work for him Are you joking

ANGIER
Youll be my spy

OLIVIA
(taken aback)
We just got our start and you want
me to leave

ANGIER
Its how we advance

Angier moves to Olivia placing his hands on her

ANGIER (CONTD)
Think of it Olivia weve got
people excited about Cutters version
of the trick- imagine what we could
do with the real illusion Well
have the greatest magic act anyones
ever seen

OLIVIA
(frustated)
He knows I work for you

ANGIER
Exactly why hell want to hire you

Alley shows Angier in Tesla is sitting reading

TESLA
You must be curious to see what so
much money had bought you Mr Angier

Tesla RISES Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and
pulls a SHEET from a ten-foot tall apparatus- the ELECTRICAL
MACHINE Angier used on stage in the opening of the film

TESLA (CONTD)
Fitting that you should be here for
the maiden voyage

Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the
machine It RUMBLES into life smoke pouring from the slats

TESLA (CONTD)
Your hat

Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla
Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark
directly underneath the machine He returns to the controls

ALLEY
You might want to stand back

TESLA

No no It will be fine Mr Alley

please proceed
Without further ceremony Alley FIRES the machine
Nothing happens Then as they watch the GLOBE on top of
the tripped FLASHES whits hot BOLTS shooting out of it
wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod The CHARGE
reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG as if it has
broken the sound barrier
Suddenly the room is still
Tesla walks forward Looks down into the pit

Alley joins him at the edge of the pit Angier limping
is the last to arrive locking into the pit-

-at the TOP HAT which hasnt moved an inch

ANGIER
I dont understand-

Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with
CONCENTRARION Alley pulls Angier away from the pit

ALLEY
Perhaps it would be best if you left
us to it Well see you next week

Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door

BORDEN

Ah The truth A slippery notion
in our life of work Miss Wenscombe

OLIVIA

He wants me to come and work for you

BORDEN
What does he need my secret for
His trick is top notch The Great
Danton vanishes and isntantly
reappears on the other side of the
stage -- mute overweight and
unless Im mistaken rather drunk

Borden rises moves closer to Olivia

BORDEN (CONTD)
Tell me Olivia Does he like taking
his bows under the stage

Olivia meets his gaze

OLIVIA
No Its killing him hes obsessed
with discovering your method He
thinks of nothing else and takes no
pleasure in our sucess Ive had
enough Theres no future with him
He sent me here to steal your secrets

CUTTER
Worse He realized he can make
demands
ANGIER

Hes blackmailing us

CUTTER
In a word yes Im surprised to
be honest- it usually takes them a
lot longer to figure it out

ANGIER
How much does he want

CUTTER
It makes no difference- we have to
stop doing the trick

ANGIER
(wields paper)
Stop doing the trick Look at this

CUTTER
Look at yesterdays And last weeks
where they called you Londons
premiere stage performer not
Magician mind Performer Of any
kind

ANGIER
Whats the point

CUTTER
My point Robert is that youve
climbed too high to get away with
any kind of professional
embarrassament Were not doing any
tricks we cant control

Angier considers this Nods Thinking

ANGIER
Pay him whatever he wants for now
We keep doing the trick till Borden
opens then well phase it out

ROOT
Thanks

A new pint arrives Root sips

BORDEN
Actually theres something I might
warn you about

ROOT
Oh

BORDEN

Well its your Transported Man

know your method but I hada
similar trick in my act- and I used

(looks around

whispering)
-a double

ROOT
Oh I see very good

BORDEN
At first Then it went bad You
se I hadnt counted on the fact
that once I incorporated this bloke
into my act he had complete power
over me

glass

ROOT
Complete power you say

BORDEN

(nodding gravely)
Weel he was the secret you see
And the more successful I became
the more outrageous his demands
became He practically backrupted
me In the end I had to stop
performing the illusion completely

(looks at Root)
You must be very careful about giving
someone that power over you

Root looks at Borden Drunken whells spinning

ROOT
Thanks for the warning

Of course Borden said that-

OLIVIA
He didnt say anything- hed never
say Ive seen things- make-up
glasses wigs We dont use any of

hidden backstage

ANGIER
(scorn)
Its misdirection- he leaves those
things lying around to make you think

All the time He doesnt know when
Im looking-

ANGIER
All the time Olivia- thats who he
is thats what it takes- he lives

You stole it

OLIVIA
I borrowed it for tonight I thought
youd be able to translate some of
it but now I realize-

ANGIER
I cant
OLIVIA
(scorn)
You cant
ANGIER

Olivia no one could-

(studies pages)
Its a cypher- with a transposition
that probably shifts every day of
the diary Even with the keyword it
would take months to decode

OLIVIA
And without the keyword

ANGIER
Perhaps never Well see

Angier puts the cardboard-bound notebook into his pocket
Olivia worried holds out her hand for the notebook

OLIVIA
No we wont- if I dont get that

with discovering your method he
thinks of nothing else and takes no
pleasure in our success Ive had
enough There is no future with
him He sent me here to steal your
secrets but Ive actually come to
offer you his

BORDEN
He has no secrets from me

Borden stares at her unsure

BORDEN (CONTD)
This is the truth you spoke of

She gives him a sly smile

OLIVIA
No This is what he told me to tell
you

Beat

OLIVIA (CONTD)
The truth is that I loved him And
stood by him And he sent me to you
like hed send a stagehand to pick
up his shirts
(looks him in the eye)
I hate him for that

They sit there in silence appraising each other

BORDEN
I can spot Angiers methods from the
back of the theatre What could you
possibly have to offer me

Olivia smiles moves to Borden reaching for his gloved hand
Borden flinches surprised

OLIVIA
You may know he does his tricks
but you cant understand why no one
can see that yours are better

She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his
mutiladed hand

OLIVIA (CONTD)

You hide this I had to look closely
to spot it when you performed the
Transported Man

(looks into his eyes)
But this makes you unique it shows
the audience that you arent using a
double You musnt hide it you
must display it proudly

(looks at hand)
Im sure it takes great skill to
perform illusions with one good hand

BORDEN
(quietly)
It does

much more then he is I can show
you how

ANGIER

Ive veen played for a fool
ALLEY

Who by
ANGIER

Tesla never made a machine like the
one I asked for

ALLEY
We never said he had

ANGIER
You let me believe that he had Alley
(MORE )
Alley points to the top hat which

ANGIER (CONTD)
You stole my money because your
funding was cut off- youve been
shooting sparks at my top hat
laughing at me all along while you
use my money to stave off ruin
Ive seen Edisons men-

ALLEY
Where

ANGIER
In the hotel Ive every mind to
bring them up here myself-

TESLA
That would be unwise MrAngier

Tesla is holding a cage containing a large tabby CAT

TESLA (CONTD)
It is true sir that you are your
one remaining financier But we
have not stolen your money

ALLEY
Sir my cat

Tesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE

ALLEY (CONTD)

When I told you I could make your
machine I spoke the simple truth
Science is just a name for the art
of rendering the exotic mundane It
has no boundaries- its very purpose
is to destroy boundaries

ANGIER
Then why isnt the machine working

Tesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles

TESLA
Because exact science MrAngier is
not an exact science The machine
simply does not operate as expected
It needs continued examination

ANGIER
Where did my top hat go

ALLEY
Nowhere

is sitting on a workbench

ALLEY (CONTD)
Weve tried the damn thing a dozen
times And the hat went nowhere

TESLA
Which is why we need to rey a
different material It may provoke

a different result
Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley
TESLA (CONTD)
You dont expect me to handle the

thing myself

Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the
TERRIFIED CAT He jumps down into the pit and secures the
animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground

ALLEY
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal Doctor

Alley pulls himself out of the pit and Tesla CHARGES the
generator

The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES
Without ceremony Tesla FIRES the machine As before large
BOLTS spew from the head of the machine down towards the
unseen cat The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR then
sputters out

Silence The three men begin edging towards the pit

Suddenly a terrifying SCREECH The cat is still there
still tied to the hook

Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car
Tesla looks frustated Suddenly the cat bursts free of
Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab

ANGIER
Ill go

Angier limps after the cat

Suddenly a HORRIBLE SCREECHING reaches Angier He begins
to follow the noise

He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE no more than ten
feet across

Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier
He tries to separate the two animals and succeeds in grabbing
one The other cat RACES off

Angier takes a few steps after it then FREEZES staring at-

TOP HATS Clustered in a small glads The first cat slinks
its way through them

The SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angiers hands- RACES into
the glade HISSING SPITTING CHASING the first cat into the
woods beyond-

Angier is left alone in the clearing staring at the pile of
dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS

EXT PORCH TESLAS LABORATORY -- DAY

The top hats are in a pile on the dark Tesla is at the
table measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers Angier
and Alley are watching

ANGIER
So the machine was working

ALLEY
I never bothered to check the
calibration The hat never moved

TESLA
These things never quite work as you
expect them to Mr Angier Thats
one of the principal beauties of
science

Tesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands It has a
tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim He picks up another
hat It has the same TEAR

TESLA (CONTD)
Well need a couple of weeks to iron
out the-
(looks at hats)
-problems with the machine I1l
send word when its ready

Angier still dazed takes his cane and heads for the door

TESLA (CONTD)
Dont forget your hat

Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats

ANGIER
Which one is mine

TESLA
They are all your hat Mr Angier

Tesla smiles at him
