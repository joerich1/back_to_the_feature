BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
It is late night and deserted Engine noise

headlights appear as the car draws closer we hear

It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by the

a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by
it

We hold as another car approaches This one is a
sedan whose occupant does not sing

INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE

The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled
and cocked bow tie He is flushed a Rogue forelock
over his forehead and he merrily sings Casey Jones
with the passenger a young woman in a party dress who
squeals rocks with the motion of the car and
enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus

ANOTHER EMPTY STREET

The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and
the

holding a

He

with

reflection

dress is

approaches with its singing

REVERSE

The car enters and roars away After a beat of quiet
conservative sedan enters and recedes

BEACH

We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel The singing
squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to

halt

The young woman staggers out still giggling and
half-empty bottle of champagne

The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag

MAN
Number Seven

She trots away
The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself
straightens his bow tie He puffs his bounding forelock

one finger nods his head to make it bounce grins
approvingly and cocks a pistol-finger at his own

Zing
MOTEL ROOM
The man enters and looks around The young womans
tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen
The man pulls an imaginary train whistle

MAN
Choo Choo

He looks around in a closet under the bed

MAN
Im a locomotive baby Im the Wabash
cannonball Im a hunka-hunka
burninnnnn love I got fire in my
boiler and a fuh -- a fuh --

He is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from
behind the
window curtain

A salacious smiles spreads across his lips He pulls on
the

cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young
woman in

red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductors

cap
YOUNG WOMAN
Tickets please
The man is stripping off his clothes
MAN
Excuse me Miss is this the train
to Ecsssstasy
YOUNG WOMAN
Pull in your ears Rexie -- youre

Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the
bed
just as --
CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky
black
man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat
rushes
into the room with a video camera glued to his eye He
looks
like Clarence Thomas with a mustache
MAN
Im gonna nail your ass
The young woman screams clutching the sheets to her
naked
bosom Rex leaps from the bed still clad only in his
chemindefer boxers and darts around the room seeking
egress

The man with the video charges around the room
following Rex
THE VIDEO IMAGE

Rex is stumbling around the room in a panic looking

for his
clothing The camera swish-pans back to the young woman

his
trousers mooning us

INT MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm

MILES
The problem is that everyone is
willing to compromise Thats the
problem with the institution of
marriage -- its based on compromise
Even through its dissolution One
attorney will try to score some
points the opposition will try to
room

of

humidor

from

impeach The process will find an
equilibrium point determined by the
skill of the opposing lawyers and
then each party will walk away with
their portion of the goodies Some
say Life is compromise But at
Massey Myerson we believe life is
struggle and the ultimate destruction
of your opponent

The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference

RECEPTIONIST
Your eleven oclock is here

MILES
Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will
continue this at the Associates

MILES
Well with the expanding global

opportunities which must present
themselves to the knock-out sexy

And your wife is aware of or has
evidence of your activities

REX

RUTH
So Miles If you have a proposal

cooling off period

RUTH
My client feels sufficiently
dispassionate

MILES
My client asks that you not initiate

with
several vials of prescription drugs

touch for
a moment

MARYLIN

enzymes

Ruth
watch the interaction

MARYLIN
(To the attorneys)

Ruth stands and closes her attaché case

RUTH

Miles calls to Ruths retreating back

MILES
Fine Well eat all the pastry

Going through the door Ruth doesnt react but Marylin

following glances back -- bemused but with a trace of
a

smile

Rex swallows two more tablets He sits looking
despondent

MILES
I think that went as well as could
be expected

REX

helmet He

and

Class

She always looked out for me

MILES
And she had private investigators
assisting her

REX
(Sentimental)
She brought my digestive enzymes

MILES
In anticipation of making you sick

REX
Maybe I should reconsider my

Miles looks at him Shakes his head sadly
MILES

A superficial display of marital
solicitude and you lose your resolve
Rex I underestimated you But Im
your attorney and if you choose to
reward her for that mediocre charade
of spousal concern

He shrugs helplessly

REX
Youre right Screw her

INT GYM - CLOSE ON

The mugger emerges from his station and makes his way

the victim

She glances over her shoulder and at the
of the monster bearing down on her screams and runs to

exit Marylin and Sarah giggle but reproachful looks

the other students force them to affect concerned

MARYLIN
(Whispers)
Every week --
SARAH

Im dying

The two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the
woman back into the room They clasp her in an empathic

group
hug
MARYLIN

his intransigence If I didnt know

personal investment in my ruination

wave by
way of greeting

MARYLIN
(Mumbles)
Hell regret this

MILES
Have you ever met Mr Rexroth

PATRICIA
No I havent But Ive been out of

(Little girlish wave)
Hello Rex Hello there

about Mrs Rexroths filial
obligations

MILES

her
psyche

PATRICIA
Let me tell you something about Patty

MILES
Whos Patty

PATRICIA
Oh Thats her name Patricia Like
mine I was Pat and she was Patty
But she changed it after seeing Some
Like It Hot To Marylin After

MILES

tell us about Patty slash Marylin

PATRICIA

When she was a tiny girl And people
asked her what she wanted to be when
she grew up She never said the usual
things little girls say -- like --
nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman
She always said --

(Very Shirley Temple)
When I grow up I want to be
divorced

She laughs happily at the memory

MILES
Divorce was her childhood aspiration

PATRICIA
Well not just divorce She used to
say I want to be divorced from some
big dumb rich guy And I guess
her dream is coming true
(To Marylin)
Im happy for you Patty

It was like that scene in The
Godfather Frankie Pentangeli is
called to testify against the Family
And hes in court and he looks into
the spectators gallery and sees his
Brother They brought the brother
from Sicily And Frankie cant say a
word He cant testify Thats what
it was like seeing Pat in there I
couldnt even have Ruth cross examine
her

RAMONA
Why do you think she did it

MARYLIN
(Shrugs)
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA
Maybe they offered her money Massey
is very seductive Who knows

RAMONA
Maybe they put a horse head in her
bed

SARAH

That stinks They left you with
absolutely nothing It makes you
wonder about the entire legal system
Like Rodney King

MARYLIN
They bought her speech If I was
only in it for Rexs money he
shouldnt have to give me any

RAMONA
That doesnt make sense Its like
punishing you for being goal oriented

INT MILES MASSEYS OFFICE
Miles addresses BONNIE DONOVAN a client

MILES
Yes Your husband did show remarkable
foresight in taking those pictures
And yes absent a swimming pool
the presence of the pool man would
appear to be suspicious But Bonnie
who is the real victim here Let me
suggest the following Your husband
who on a prior occasion slapped you --
beat you --

BONNIE
(Reacts)
Well I wouldnt say --

MILES
Your husband who has beaten you --
repeatedly --

BONNIE
He --

MILES
Please -- was at the time brandishing
your firearm trying in his rage to
shoot an acquaintance -- friend of

long standing --
BONNIE
They hate each other --

MILES
So he says now But if not for your
cool headed intervention his tantrum
might have ended this schmoes life
and ruined his own As for the
sexual indiscretion which he imagined
had taken place wasnt it in fact
he who had been sleeping with the
pool man

He stares contemplatively at the ceiling and after a

beat
responds to the silence

Miles how nice of you to

Doyle Oil

DOYLE

I told you we know each other baby
Mr Massey represented my ex-brother-

in law Martin Reiser

MILES

Oh Right Wont you have a seat

DOYLE
(To Marylin)
After you Doll

Marylin glides into the office Seats herself on the

Doyle sits next to her one proprietary hand on her

MILES
And how is Mrs Reiser

DOYLE

Few suicide attempts little inpatient
stint Naturally she misses her

kids Six weekends a year and
alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh

to us but -- hey -- alls fair
Anyhoo she lives with a nurse

takes her meds and goes to

occupational therapy at a local

sheltered workshop

MILES
So shes uh flourishing

DOYLE

She makes felt wallets Got one right

here

Doyle pulls out a deranged piece of felt stuffed with

Most of the contents slip to the floor

DOYLE
Yeah I know Leather would be more
practical but whatcha gonna do

MARYLIN
Miles I know youre busy and that
you charge by the hour so Ill come
to the point Howard and I are
planning to marry

Miles is stunned

MILES
Muh -- Well uh -- Huh

DOYLE
Yep My divorce just came through
Shoulda called you Coulda cut a
better deal My wife still has health
insurance and gets to see the
children But I dont know Guess
Im just a softie After all Amanda
and me were together for -- what --
youd know better than me Marylin
She was your best friend

MARYLIN
(Thinks)
Sixteen years Howard Jr is fourteen
and Mandy must be what -- twelve
DOYLE
(To Miles)

Here Got pictures

He removes a family photo from the felt wallet Its of
Howard

and two fat teenagers Apparently the former Mrs Doyle
was

cut out but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill
visible in

the shot
MILES
I uh guess congratulations are in
order
DOYLE
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up
and
MARYLIN

Honey I dont think this is really
relevant to

DOYLE
and one day this sweet girl calls
me asks me to lunch Just a shoulder
to cry on deal One thing leads to
another and before I know it --

MARYLIN
-- we realized wed always been very
attracted to one another

MILES
No

DOYLE
I had no idea until after but --

He looks at her with predatory lust

DOYLE
Baby You are so HOT

MARYLIN

(Coy)
Howard

He pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on
her

MILES
What a touching story

DOYLE
You know Miles after my wife --
wifes mastectomy -- things were

never the same This might sound
cold well maybe not to you Massey
but

(man to man)

I like my women with two boobs

Miles flashes Marylin a you are KIDDING look but she
assiduously avoids eye contact

MARYLIN

Howard and I are here Miles because
I have learned through bitter
experience that when it comes to
matrimonial law you are the very
best

Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod

He gropes

MARYLIN
As you are well aware my previous
marriage ended with an unjustified
strain on my reputation My motives
were questioned I was slandered in
court

DOYLE
You did good Massey

MARYLIN
Therefore in an effort to remove any
trace of suspicion from my sweet
Howard -- I wish to execute a pre-
nuptial agreement

DOYLE
And -- theres no talking her out of
it Believe me Ive tried

MARYLIN
They say the Massey pre-nup has never
been penetrated

DOYLE
She said penetrate Heh heh heh

her She giggles like a teenager

MILES
Oh for the love of

MARYLIN
That is true isnt it Miles Your
pre-nup is the best there is

MILES

That is correct Not to blow my own
horn but they devote an entire
semester to it at Harvard Law

DOYLE
Harvard Whoa Daddy

MILES
I just want to make sure that you
both --

He eyes Marylin
MILES

-- understand what youre asking for
here The Massey pre-nup provides
that in the event of a dissolution
of the marriage for any reason both
parties shall leave it with whatever
they brought in and earned during
No one can profit from the marriage
The pre-nup protects the wealthier

party
DOYLE

Well -- at the moment thatd be me
MILES

And without it that party is exposed --
a sitting duck No wriggle room

DOYLE
A Wriggle Room Maybe we should put
that in the Malibu house Screw the
screening room

MILES
(slightly sickened)

-- and we are sure

Eyes boring into Marylin

MILES
-- we are both sure thats what we
want

MARYLIN
Absolutely

DOYLE

Course I cant do much wriggling
if you tie me up like that again

Massey -- this is one bad bad little
girl
MARYLIN
(laughing)
Wed better go before we get thrown
out

The main course -- Mature Love -- a
hearty stew cooked slowly in the
oven of companionship until the meat

together -- the sweetness of a Life
Well Lived A sorbet of grandchildren

retirement

There is silence broken only by the twitter of birds

the restlessness of a hungry audience

RABBI BOLENKSY
Do you Chaim David Doyle take Marylin

love and trust Be happy for me
Miles

MILES
Well when this goes south -- promise
youll have dinner with me
MARYLIN
(She holds a plate of
food for him)

how long it should take for the ink
on the settlement to dry

He takes the plate of food from her

will be no settlement This time it

impending lust
CLICK - LIGHTS OUT
EXT MASSEY MYERSON - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Miles is addressing the young associates
MILES

For the first time in my life I

stand before you naked

vulnerable and in love Love A

word matrimonial lawyers shy away

from Ironic isnt it -- that I have

been frightened of this emotion which

is in a sense the seed of my
livelihood But today I am here to
tell you Love should cause us no
fear Love should cause us no shame
Love is good

(He lets it sink in)
Let me ask you a question When our
clients come to us confused angry
hurting because their flame of love
is fluttering and threatens to die --
should we seek to extinguish that
flame so that we can sift through
the smoldering wreckage for our paltry
reward Or should we seek to fan
this precious flame -- this most
precious flame -- back to loving
roaring life

The young associates look confused Wrigley raises his
hand

WRIGLEY
Extinguish

MILES
Should we counsel fear -- or trust
Should we seek to destroy -- or to
build Should we meet our clients’
problems with cynicism -- or with
love

MILES
(another raised hand)
Kramer

KRAMER
Build

MILES
The decision of course is each of
ours For my part I have made the
leap of love and there is no going
back --

Herb Myserson sits in the back of the room He watches
breathing heavily

Joe is raising the gun at Miles Miles sprays him with
Mace

fora

inhaler

toward

blindly

points

asthma

ofa

BANG -- Joe fires blindly scrunching his eyes against
chemical sucking for breath like a jet engine revving
take-off

SLAM -- Marylin elbows him in the face breaking his
She finishes with a solid groin kick It slows him
doesnt stop him

Joe stumbles a bit but regains his footing

BANG -- Joe is rampaging around the room still firing
thumping at his chest with his free hand for his

Marylin runs to Miles He takes her hand and they run
the door seeking egress
BANG -- still firing he pulls out the inhaler but

bobbles it

Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from
falling He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler

Miles pops up in front of him

MILES
Marylin Run Ill distract him

MARYLIN
Im not leaving you I took self
defense
Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he
the inhaler at Miles
He squeezes -- WHUSH -- Miles squints against the

mist and lets out a horrified

MILES
Joe

BANG The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound

body dropping heavily to the floor
Silence

Marylin runs over to Miles They look sadly down at the

floor
MILES
WE told him it was no go

INT MASSEY MYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand
against

the other

Miles sits gazing sadly out the window

The room is empty

There is the whir of ventilation

The click of the door attracts both their attention and
brings

them to their feet

Marylin walks in chic and beautiful as ever followed
by

Ruth who sits next to her places her attaché case on
the

table top and snaps its clasps

RUTH
Alright

WRIGLEY
Ruth

Miles and Marylin are looking at each other Quietly

MILES
Hello Marylin

MARYLIN
Hello Miles

MILES
Hard to believe this is the way it
will end up for us

MARYLIN
Its not something I wanted either
MILES
But then -- I guess -- something
inside me died when I realized that
youd hired a goon to kill me

MARYLIN
Yes I know Its exactly how I felt
when I realized youd hired the goon
to kill

RUTH
Now you both wait a minute Nobody
hired anyone to kill anyone

WRIGLEY
Hear hear

There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats Wrigley

looks
at Miles
WRIGLEY
Apparently from what I can gather
a burglar broke into your house --
became despondent over his lifestyle
and shot himself
Miles is still looking at Marylin
MILES
Where does that leave us
RUTH
Weve outlined a settlement
She pushes a piece of paper across the table
RUTH
We think its more than generous
Miles ignores the paper which lies unclaimed on the
middle

of the table He looks at Marylin

WRIGLEY
My client is prepared to consider a
reconciliation

Marylin looks a Miles

MARYLIN
How could I trust you after after
all of this
Miles staring at Marylin cuts in

MILES
You wounded me first Marylin

MARYLIN
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth

MILES
Youre forgetting Howard Doyle

MARYLIN
Forgery Fraud

MILES
Income tax evasion

MARYLIN
Murder

MILES
Murder

MARYLIN

I dont see how we can ever find our
way back from

Miles with his eyes still on Marylin reaches into his

suit
coat He withdraws a piece of paper spreads it flat on
the
table in front of him and still gazing at her
MILES
You know theres nothing in the
Massey pre-nup that says it cant be
executed after the parties wed
He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen
looks
down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his
name
He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin
Gazing at him seeking the truth in his eyes she
absently

picks up the paper
There is a long silence We hear only the hum of
ventilation
and Wrigleys quiet snuffling

Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses --
over
Marylins shoulder -- at the sheet of paper Marylin

however
looks only at Miles

RUTH
Its the Massey pre-nup --

Marylin rips the paper in half
RUTH
(bored)
O-kay Im going back to the office
Wrigley sobs openly
RUTH
Come on Wrigley Ill buy you a drink

and an anti depressant

WRIGLEY
No one will ever love me that way

RUTH
Not if youre lucky No

Miles rises slowly to his feet

He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward
Marylin rises slowly to her feet

She leans forward

They kiss

MILES
Lets go home

EXT MASSEY HOUSE - DAY

We hear a SMASHING -- BREAKING

Gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing -- but
quickly

prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from
one
end of the yard to the other
TRACK THROUGH HOUSE TO

INT MASSEY BEDROOM

The smashing is becoming louder
AN AXE

Breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to

the
master suite
MILES
Wait Just wait for one minute Sweet
Jesus are you crazy
CONSTRUCTION WORKER LOOKS UP
hes the one wielding the axe His co-worker casts a
look in

our direction

MILES

reaches under the rubble and removes one box of Cohiba

Especials
CONSTRUCTION WORKER

Miles casts a rueful look at the cigars

MILES
Pre-Castro
MARYLIN

Fine They were created during a
dictatorship

(Placing a protective

hand on her BIG belly)
What if something happened to you
What would I tell little Gus when he
asked what was my daddy like

Miles looks at the box then at his wife He tosses the

box
to the concerned construction worker
MILES
Here buddy These are for you
The construction worker gives him a very hostile look
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
(Mumbles)
Great Now I can die
MILES
Well Youd say they devoted a whole
semester at Harvard to your Dad But
your Mom was the one that ever only
nailed his ass
MARYLIN
