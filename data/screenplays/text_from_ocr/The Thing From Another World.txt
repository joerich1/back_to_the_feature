This is the social center for USA flying men roosting
in the Polar regions The air base is near Dutch Harbor
Alaska’ - a commuting hop from the Arctic Circle It is
early winter The night in Dutch Harbor is long and
dark

In the room two of the six gaming tables are occupied
At one sits a four handed bridge game At the other sit
five men playing poker RADIO MUSIC - an American
Service Broadcast - is coming a bit feebly into the room
All is cozy and steam-heated in the room

Among the five poker players are three men who are to be
active in our story One is WO Vic MacAuliff He is
a tough taciturn radio man He has seen service
everywhere heard nearly all the languages and drunk
nearly all the different brews of the earths

The second is Captain Pat Henry in his early thirties
Captain Henry has been a flyer since he shed his first
stocking cap He is a man of whimsey and temper and
also mood

The third is Lieutenant Eddie Dykes a tall homely man
under thirty

The overcoats boots ear-lapped military hats of the
aviators lie on an unused table nearby

INT DR CARRINGTONS LABORATORY

This is a large chamber in a separate building Here
are concentrated the instruments used by the various
scientists in their astronomical mineralogical and
botanical experiments

-

10 ( )

At a large flat-topped table in the room sits Dr Arthur
Carrington He is a man of 43 with an alert cheerful
face He is good looking well built soft spoken

His dominant characteristic is a smile that seems never
to leave his lips It is present always on his face
like an extra feature He is a genius of science and
and man whose brain is focused like a microscope on the
secrets of nature But the intensity of his preoccupa-
tion with science is not to be heard in the easy tones
of his voice It will be seen in the things he does
in his point of view - but never in his manner
Outwardly he seems only a good looking man full of
child-like enthusiasm for a task and with a soothing
amiable way for his fellow man

In the room with Dr Carrington is a lean young man
named William Stone in charge of the camps
photographic work and equipment

Captain Henry stands silently in the doorway his eyes
moodily on his scientific rival The doctor is
studying the indicator dials of a complex instrument on
the table Bill Stone greets the arrivals

STONE
Hello Nikki Hello Captain

Carrington who seems aware neither of

INT STOREROOM

A faint light from the underground hallway comes through
a transom Barnes enters The electric blanket
discarded by Ken lies on a nearby packing case It is
Plugged into the electric light socket hence no light
dn the room Barnes snaps on his flashlight and gets a
bottle of whiskey out of another case opens it and
takes a long swig He leans over and plugs his flying
suit into the other half of the doublesocket shared
by the elégtric blankets plug He takes another drink
and sitting in the semi-dark starts whistling
Ragtime Cowboy Joe

Suddenly he stops whistling and laughs

- BARNES

He lifts the whiskey bottle again then sits staring
toward the iceencased mummy

He switches on his flashlight and
centers its beam on the ice-block
As Ericson said the ice is now almost
transparent Through it only
partially distorted can be seen an
unearthly horror It has a bulbous
head a tiny suck-hole for a mouth
multiple eyes no ears Its arms
are extra-long ending in thorny
clusters rather than hands It
stares malevolently through the ice

Barnes lets out a grunt of dismay
and turns the flashlight away

BARNES
Whew

He drinks again and then starts
making himself comfortable He
uses a bag of fhour for a pillow
and prepares to stretch out on
‘the floor Abruptly he shines
the flashlight on the ice again

BARNES
(angrily)
Quit staring at met

Hesees the blanket lying on the
nearby packing case He picks
it up and throws it over the
ice-cakes
BARNES
I could go nuts looking at you

He lies down puts his head on
the flour sack and taking a
magazine from his pocket prepares
to read The camera moves to

the electric blanket now covering
the ice-cake then follows the
electric connection down to the
indicator affixed to the cord
The indicator hand points to the
full on position

moves back to the floor beneath

He is having difficulty reading His flashlight has
started to wane He snaps it on and off experimentally
The battery is nearly dead Barnes aims it at the
printed page once more then decides it is useless for

out more comfortably

illuminates the scene

sits up into the picture

At this moment a moving shadow falls
across his face He looks up quickly

An expression of pure terror appears

on his face He screams eerily springs

to his feet and jerks out his revolver

He fires six times then still screaming
jumps for the storeroom door the cord from

It shouldnt Imagine how strange it
would have seemed in the pliecene age
to forecast that worms fish and
lizards that crawled over the earth
were geing to evolve into us On
the planet from which our visitor
came vegetaole life underwent an
evolution similar to that of our own
animal life which would explain the
superiority of its brain Its
development was not handicapped by
emotional or sexual factors

SKEELY
Dr Carrington youre a man whos
won the Nobel prize Youve recaived
every kind of international kudos a
scientist can attain If you were
for sale I could get a million bucks
for you from any foreisn government
i am not therefore going to stick
my neck out and say that you are
stuffed absolutely clean full of
wild blueberry muffins but I
promise you that my readers are going
to think so

CARRINGTON
(smiling)
Not for long Mr Skeely In fact not
even for a moment if they happen to know
anything about the flora of their own
planet

SKEELY
Yeu mean there are vegetables right
here on earth that - that can think

CARRINGTON
A certain kind of thinking yes-
Did you ever hear of the Telegraph
Vine Or the Acanthus Century Plant

SKEELY
Not recently

CARRINGTON
The Century Plant catches mice bata
squirrels «- any mammals small enough
to evade its privacy- It lures them (contd)

CARRINGTON (contd)
with a bait of sweet syrup then it
closes like a fist and’ feeds on the
corpse of its catch It is only a
plant but its brain can obviously
outwit a species far above it in
the scale of minds as we measure
them

SKEELY
(seribbling)
Thanks doctor And whats a
Telegraph Vine

CARRINGTON
A vine that has proven beyond doubt
that it can signal to other vines
of its species twenty or one
hundred miles away If an insect
migration for instance is moving
in’a certain direction it will
devour the first vine but the second
one having been warned will have
altered its chemical structure
so that the inseets find it inedible

SKEELY
(still
seribbling)
Thats one for Ripley

CARRINGTON
(smiling)
There are hundreds of other examples
No Mr Skeely intelligence in
vegetable and plants is an old
story on this planet of ours Older
even than the animal arrogance
that has overlooked it

CARRINGTON

colder than ours and that its
atmosphere is too thin to conduct

need none

He pulls tommy-gun from under his bed and brandishes it

DYKES AND BARNES
Whatts up
Where is it

A GRASH from the window is their answer

HENRY
Pillows Get those pillows in
front of your faces

A second ‘GRASH sends the entire window hurtling into
the room The Creature springs into their midst

GUNS ROAR The Creature moves toward MacAuliff His
tommy-gun chatters at it point-blank It strikes at
the tommygun knocking it out of MacAuliffs hands
and sending MacAuliff sprawling

The Creature Jumps after MacAuliff It 1s balked for a
moment by Henry ‘who strikes It with his ice axe

(Corr rox)

A bullet hits the light Only the dim light of the
kerosene lamp remains

The Creature whips its knifed hand at Henrys face
Henry partially blocks the blow with his pillow which
shreds in the air Henry staggers back against the
wall He elmost knocks over the hurricane lamp He
picks it up and dashes it at the Creature Flaming
kerosene spatters over it As it stands burning torch-
like in the middle of the room Barnes moves forward

and strikes a mighty blow with his axe The blow
misses Instantly the Creature wheels and seizes Barnes
by the throat Barnes seresms orice His scream gurgle s
away Dykes holding his entire cot in front of him
as a shield rushes forward followed by Henry They
smash at the monster which still holding Barnes with
one tentacle retreats to a corner of the room

It ia the corner in which Nikki has been crouching

She screams The Créature whips its free talon at her
and secures her by the arm Still afire it starts
dragging its two victims toward the window Nikkis
“sereams fill the room Once more Henry charges forward
with his ice axe and sinks its pointed end into the
Creatures head

The Creature stops drops Nikki and lashes at Henry
This time its areed knife-fingers slash Henrys wrist
Henry drops the axe and fells back Dykes still
shielded by his cot hasat the seme time grabbed
Nikkits ankle and pulled her away MacAuliff has
picked up the can containing the remainder of the
kerosene He throws it on the Creaturo The blaze
surges ups

Parts of the room have caught fire
The Creature picks up Barnes and
springs out the window into the
storm

For a moment its motion through
the night is etched in fire Then
the wind and snow extinguish the
flames ‘The Creature disappears
Dykes moves quickly from Nikki to
bend over Henry who is kneeling in
silent agony clutching his
lacerated forearm

Dykes snaps on a flashlight

(panting)
You all wight Pat

HENRY
(with difficulty)
Yeh

The Geiger counter is now clicking loudly Holding

It is entirely dark Henrys flashlight stabs into the

faces of the others then finding Carrington
Carringtod stands with a gun in his hand staring
wildly

Henrys response is to charge forward He grabs the
revolver with one hand and hits Carrington with the
other Jarrington falls unconscious alongside the
generators Henry seizes Carringtons revolver

HENRY
(as he retrieves
the revolver)
Mac Radding Get those
generators connected

He darts out as Mac and Redding turn their flashlights
on the generator and fall to work

DISSOLVE TO

INT RADIO ROOM

The redly glowing door begins to fall inward As it
topples Dykest voice is heard

DYKES
Never mind the guns Use your
axes

The Creature stands revealed in the doorway radioactivit
causes it to shimmer weirdly in the dark It pauses a
moment in the doorway then moves toward the little
group in the mouth of the passageway

HENRYS VOICE
“(in the dark)
Fall back fellows - Get going
Skeely You next Ken Move

The group retreats in order down the passageway The
Thing pauses at the entrance of the corridor

MACAULIFFS VOICE
(in the dark)
All connected - Okay Pat --

The tunnel lights begin to glow rodly revealing the
Army group retreating over the fence wire The Orcature
is advancing toward thom but has not yet entered the
trapped tunnel

ERICSON
Ittsconnected Whatre you
waiting for Pat

HENRY
(coolly)
Im waiting to catch it in the
middle of the tunnel Ken
Take Lt easy son

At this moment there comes the sound of a scuffling
from the generator room A figure bursts out into the
tunnel as we hear a chorus of Grab him Shut the
door Hold him hes crazy etc The figure is
Carrington He pushes by Henry Dykes and tho rest of
the Army group and runs the longth of the corridor
He comes to a halt at the far end of the corridor
facing the Creature Carrington only a few feet away
from the unearthly visitor extends his arms in a A
pleading gesture

° HENRY
(during this)
Grab him Eddie Stop him

DYKES
Too late Shall I go get him

(after a split
second)
No No Eddie dont Fall

CARRINGTON (contd)
Believe me You have a greator
intelligence than anything on

at me and know what Im trying
to tell you - Im not your

The Creature has paused before Carringtonts tirade as
if studying him Now without haste it lifts one arm
and flicks its hand at Carringtons throat Carrington
falls to tho floor almost decapitated his last words
still gurgling in his throats The Creature steps over
Carringtonts corpse and enters the tunnel It advances
five or six steps

i HENRY
(crying sharply)
Watch out Here we go

He presses the switch in his hand A bombardment of
huge sparks leaps from coiling to floor The Creature
is caught in the lightning flashes It stands
motionless as the thousand volt bolts crack through it
from head to foot In front of it stand the five men -
axes ready and weirdly visibls in the spitting light
The Creature begins to glow like a filament then
bursts into flame It sinks to the ground

HENRY
‘Dontt move anybody

camera)

The Creaturets form melts in the flames As it dwindles
away Henry ends the spark bombardment The lights of
the passage come up full The men move toward the heap
of ashes remaining of the Creature

HENRY
(to Mac)
Go tell them its over - and to
get the furnace going

Ag MacAuliff moves to obey Chapman Nikki and a number
of the refugees come out of the generator room
