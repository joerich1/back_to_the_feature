(through echo

To aman out of the distant past
NO we live in a world of unbelievable
magic At a touch of our fingers
we produce light heat or sound
Men travel swiftly through the air
and beneath the sea We speak with
friends thousands of miles away
through a tiny wire Familiar
things yet fantastic ‘Thus
when we enter the realm of the
distant past we must accept the -
strange wonders of that time
