INT JESSICA’‘S BEDROOM NIGHT
A woman lying on a bed fully dressed at night

She is staring at a suit in a cupboard lit by the cupboard
light A dark old fashioned suit with silver buttons

The camera pulls back from the suit to reveal an old man
standing by the bedrest looking down at her

He is wearing the same suit

EXT COMPOUND NIGHT

Georgia a young punk beauty walking two German Shephards
through the field towards a pen She opens the door of the pen

the dogs bound inside

GEORGIA
No howling tonight now

One of the dogs whines turns its head towards an elaborate
farmhouse compound centre of the property

There is the sound of music coming from it
GEORGIA
There’s enough howling down there
INT RECORDING STUDIO NIGHT

A guitar playing bassy lazy dirty Someone is laying down
some tracks

The camera tracks from the guitarist’s fingers to find

A stiff worn noose hanging on the studio wall next to a series
of platinum and gold records

An equally ancient foetus in a jar -

A framed drawing of the Seven Dwarfs done in a childish and
creepy hand signed by John Wayne Gracy

A framed Rolling Stone cover with a band Jude’s Hammer in full
heavy metal gear -

An Iron Maiden - medieval torture rack - it’s rusted spikes
stuck with memo notes and post-its -

An ancient human skull with a hole in the centre of the
cranium a collection of pens inside -
The camera once again finds the guitarist and we recognise him
from the Rolling Stone poster

Judas Coyne ex heavy metal star He is wearing thick earphones
lost in the sound

By the mixing desk sits his assistant Danny Wooten He is
passing his time away as most engineers do on the web

DANNY
You gotta check this out chief

Danny can’t hear him Plays one more lick takes off the
headphones

JUDE
You got that

DANNY
Yeah Perfect

He plays it back

DANNY
But you have to check out this here
JUDE
Yeah -
DANNY
You believe in ghosts
JUDE
No
DANNY
Then why do you collect this occult
shit
JUDE

It goes with the music
He looks round at the drawing of the Seven Dwarfs

DANNY
John Wayne Gracy goes with the music

JUDE
He was a fan Did that on Death Row

DANNY
Well someone’s selling one
JUDE
What Another Wayne Gracy drawing

DANNY
No A ghost A spirit

JUDE
How do you sell a ghost

DANNY
Have a look -

As the music still plays Jude walks over to the computer
sitting on the mixing desk

ON THE COMPUTER —
A site up and running In bold letters -

SCREEN

JUDE

Danny scrolls through the site

DANNY
Well not exactly a ghost Old guys

Jude continues playing licks on the guitar as Danny scrolls
through the site He sees on the screen -

SCREEN

DANNY
It’d go with your collection

JUDE
This has to be a joke

Danny reads

DANNY
“T will sell my father’s suit to the
highest bidder I believe his spirit
is attached to it”
Jude keeps playing lost in the music

DANNY
Highest bid is eighty bucks

JUDE

INT JUDE’S BEDROOM DAY

Jude asleep in an enormous bed beside the tattooed body of
Georgia

The phone rings Only Jude wakes answers it

JUDE
Yeah
INT LOUISIANA FARMHOUSE DAY

Arlene a woman in a nurse’s uniform by the phone In the
background we can see an immobile patient on a bed

ARLENE
Got the forms from Dr Newland

JUDE Arlene

ARLENE
That’s me

JUDE What is it now

ARLENE
He won’t allow me send them You got
to come here to sign

INT JUDE’S BEDROOM DAY

He sighs Georgia shifts beside him

JUDE
Why not

ARLENE (0S)
Guess there’s some things you just
can’t do long distance

EXT JUDES COMPOUND MORNING

Georgia dressed in a black T shirt and jeans is throwing
knives into a tree with a target painted on the bark She seems
pretty expert at it The two German Shepherds lolling in the

grass Jude from the house with a bag over his shoulder

JUDE
Be gone two days Georgia

GEORGIA
That’s where I’m from Not my name

Thunk Another knife embeds itself in the tree
JUDE
What did they call you in that pole-
dancing place Where you did those
knife tricks

GEORGIA
Morphine

JUDE
I’m guessing that wasn’t your name
either

GEORGIA

Ever have a girl from Virginia

JUDE
Yeah Called her Virginia

He kisses her goodbye and walks between her and the tree And
suddenly a knife whizzes by his cheek He stops Sees the knife
finds its home in the tree

GEORGIA
And youre heading for Louisiana

JUDE
Yep

GEORGIA
The girl or the state

A MONTAGE --
Jude driving through New York State towards a small airport

Jude exiting a small private plane walking towards a black
limo

The limo bumping down a tiny dirt-track somewhere in Louisiana
Low rolling hills Live Oaks reaching their ivy covered
branches to the ground A small shack-like farmhouse in the
distance

INT DOG POUND DAY

Dogs hundreds of them behind cages Snarling playing
sleeping Outside the cages stands Jude with Arlene sixty-
nine her voice all marbles and twang She is dressed in some
kind of nurse’s uniform

ARLENE
Guess they’1ll all have to go
JUDE
I suppose

ARLENE
Last few months I’ve been spoonin’ him
food Soft stuff he doesn’t have to
chew And vanilla custard I never met
a dyin’ person yet didn’t want some
custard on the way out the door

Jude walks out of the pound onto the swampy Louisiana farmland
Walks with Arlene towards the rambling broken-down farmhouse
The limo with it’s patient driver waiting outside

JUDE
You sure He never used to have a
sweet tooth

ARLENE
Who’s takin’ care of him

JUDE
You are

ARLENE
Well I guess I’m sure then Anyways
he wont eat custard no more

They enter the farmhouse On the ground floor past the kitchen
is a livingroom decked out like a hospice With a heart monitor
beeping An old knotty man utterly immobile lying on a bed
Not a pretty sight saliva coming out of his thin lips

JUDE
What happens now

ARLENE
Well that’s why you’re here isn’t
it Dr Newland can poke a feeing tube
in him and he’ll go on another while
longer Or you can sign that form and
well just let him be He’s not going
to recover at eighty-five and
countin’ He’s ready to let go Are
you

The old man’s eyes don’t even see Jude He walks from the room
into a small room that once was his bedroom A broken down
guitar Small bed Posters of Little Richard Robert Johnson
Canned Heat on the walls Jude takes the guitar Begins to play
a few random notes on it He looks at the face of his immobile
father as he plays
A SUDDEN SMASH-CUT —
To a child’s guitar smashing against the floor -
His father screaming swinging down with a hammer -—
The hammer hitting a young boy’s hand -
The young boy (Jude) bellowing in agony -
BACK TO SCENE -
Arlene talking from the next room
ARLENE
Guess youve been ready since the day
he broke your guitar hand with that
hammer

Jude looks up at her momentarily spooked

JUDE
Why’d you say that now

ARLENE
Came into my mind

JUDE
Yeah but why

ARLENE
Remember fixin’ the cast

Jude puts down the guitar We can see the scar of a childhood
break on his skin

He walks back into the livingroom and looks at his inert father
whose face even comatose looks fierce and unforgiving

JUDE
No tube

Arlene picks up some forms from a table behind him She hands
them to him with a pen

While he signs

ARLENE
They waste away pretty quick without
being hooked to the feed bag They
don‘t suffer none
JUDE
You sure on that

ARLENE
Why Disappointed
EXT JUDES COMPOUND MORNING
The limo driving through the electronic gates towards Jude’s
farm A UPS truck is parked in the forecourt the two dogs
barking at the immobile driver inside Jude gets out of the

limo

JUDE
Bon —- Angus —

He tries to drag the dogs off but they are snarling something
wicked

DELIVERYMAN
Ozzy Osborne has Pomeranians I saw
them on TV

He pokes a long flat box out the window

DELIVERYMAN
Cute little things Like housecats

Jude takes the package and signs

JUDE
Ozzy is a Pomeranian

He drags the dogs off as the UPS van backs out

INT JUDE’S KITCHEN MORNING

Georgia dressed only in black panties and a skimpy tank top is
bending into the open fridge She takes out a carton and drinks
from it

GEORGIA
Your godamn dogs woke me up

JUDE
Guess they’re not into sleeping till
sundown

She takes the packet from him and slices it open with a steak
knife

GEORGIA
What‘ve you got

There’s a box inside the UPS box Heart shaped
GEORGIA
You got me a present hon In a heart-—
shaped box
She kisses him Pries the lid open
GEORGIA
You can be kinda sweet when you want

to -

Takes out a suit Black and old-fashioned inside a dry-cleaning
bag She holds it up against herself

GEORGIA
Oh

She is confused for a moment

GEORGIA
For you

And Jude remembers He surprises himself with an involuntary
shiver

JUDE
Dead man’s suit

GEORGIA
What

JUDE

The ghost I bought a ghost

GEORGIA
Excuse me

JUDE
Some woman thought her father was
haunting her That’s his suit She put
it for sale on the internet Says he
comes with it

GEORGIA
You believe he does

JUDE
No

GEORGIA
You believe in anything

JUDE
Sex and rock ‘n roll

GEORGIA
Drugs

JUDE
Not anymore

GEORGIA
So why’d you buy it

JUDE
For my collection

But the way he says it is uneasy
GEORGIA
The skull The John Wayne Gracy
drawing of the seven dwarfs You are
one sick mofo Or you’d like the world
to think you are

She holds it up against him

GEORGIA
You gonna wear it Your next concert

JUDE
No

He has said that a little too quickly

GEORGIA
Maybe I will I look good in drag

She pulls it out of the dry-cleaning bag Dark and sombre with
large silver buttons

GEORGIA
Got a Johnny Cash feel to it

And there is a growl by the open doorway Angus the German
Shepard

GEORGIA
It is haunted

She waves the suit at the dog like a bullfighter with a cape
He begins to snap and howl

JUDE
Cut it out

She waves it at him Then suddenly -

GEORGIA
Jesus —-

She throws the suit to the floor

GEORGIA
Shit Godamn pin

A bright drop of blood falls on the tiled floor

JUDE
See what you get

GEORGIA
That hurts --

She flips him bird and heads for the bathroom

Jude looks at the suit on the tiled floor He bends to pick it
up Feels down the buttons Finds no pin

He looks at the spot of blood on the floor Gets a dishcloth
Wipes it clean

Looks at the suit on the floor The dogs by the door still
barking at her prank

JUDE
Walk

He takes a much-chewed ball from the counter bounces it on the
floor and throws it through the door The dogs chase and Jude
follows

EXT JUDE’S COMPOUND DAY

The ball falls in the grass The dogs lope out the kitchen door
Then stop Jude walks out of the kitchen door reaches the ball
picks it up again

JUDE
Come on guys fetch -

He loves these dogs But they are not responding They are
staring at point towards the open kitchen door from which he
came

Jude turns
POV - KITCHEN
There is a streak of sunlight coming through the window

The sunlight illuminates a pair of dark suited legs the rest of
the body in shadow

JUDE
Danny
The sun clouds over the kitchen goes back into gloom
Jude turns back to the ball

JUDE
Go go go -

He throws it The dogs chase

INT KITCHEN LATER
Danny making coffee by the counter Jude enters

DANNY
Got to see your pa

JUDE
But he didn’t see me

DANNY
Beat me till I bleed You wrote that
about him didn’t you

JUDE
His beatin’ days are over

He looks round the kitchen Eerie in the afternoon sunlight
with the dust wheeling round in it

JUDE
Where’s the suit

DANNY
What suit

JUDE
Suit you bought online --

He looks around the kitchen suddenly stressed Then goes to the
door adjoining the hallway

INT HALLWAY DAY

An old Shaker chair by the stairs The suit is draped across
it as if it always belonged there A streak of late afternoon
sunlight streaming across it

DANNY
That suit

JUDE
You tidy it away there

DANNY
Nope

Jude takes the suit by the hanger and goes upstairs

INT BEDROOM DAY

Jude enters with the suit Georgia dressed now is in the
bathroom sucking her thumb Jude puts the suit in his closet
Talks to Georgia through the open door

JUDE
You move that suit from the kitchen

GEORGIA
Uh hu

It sounds like a yes He shrugs and walks to the bathroom Turns
her face towards him takes her thumb out of her mouth

The tip is swollen and has a white-looking sore in it

JUDE
Ought to put something on that Before
it festers and rots There’s not much
work for pole dancers with
disfigurements

GEORGIA
Youre a sympathetic son of bitch you
know that

JUDE
You want sympathy go fuck James
Taylor

GEORGIA
You got his number

He puts her damaged thumb in his mouth She works round his lips
with it playfully Puts her leg between his

ON THE BED —

Their bodies fall onto the mattress He takes her thumb from his
mouth and kisses her lips

ON THE SUIT -

In the closet a shaft of sunlight falling on it The buttons
gleam against the black cloth

The sunlight hits the space above the collar Two patches on the
wallpaper gleam like eyes

ON THE BED —

Georgia raises her arms as Jude pulls off her T shirt She has
beautiful kinky tattooes all over her back

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Jude wakes suddenly with a start Georgia beside him in the
bed like an innocent girl in her sleep

He can see the buttons of the suit gleaming in the closet
And then he hears it A voice downstairs

Dim indistinct but definitely a voice

He strokes Georgia’s face She stirs but doesn’t wake

He clambers out quietly so as not to wake her

He reaches out for the Dobro guitar leaning against the wall

He opens the bedroom door and almost leaps back at a figure on
the wall opposite But he realises it is his own shadow

He walks down the stairs quietly The voice grows into a loud
whisper He kicks open the door to Danny’s office And then he
almost sighs with relief The voice is coming from a radio
which Danny has left on

A weatherman talking

WEATHERMAN
cool and dry as the front pushes
the warm air south The dead pull the
living down Some light precipitation
later

ON JUDE

Did he hear that right He walks towards the radio Dobro in his
hand like a weapon

WEATHERMAN
-thunder in the east Pull the
living down Down into the cold Down
into the hole You will di--

And he pulls the plug from the radio The voice of course
stops

Silence descends But not the right kind of silence He can see
his breath in the air even though it is still late summer

He walks back out the door and is heading back for the stairs
when we see clearly what he has just glimpsed

THE OLD MAN SITTING IN THE SHAKER CHAIR -—

To the left of the stairs His eyes closed But the suit he is
wearing is unmistakable The silver buttons gleam in the
moonlight He has a fedora hat on his knees

JUDE TRIES TO CONTROL HIS BREATHING

THE MAN HEAD STILL BOWED PLACES THE FEDORA ON HIS CROWN -
His fingers are ancient knotty purple-veigned

Jude says softly to himself

JUDE
Hey you came

Jude raises his eyes unwillingly Over the hands the buttons
gleaming on the lapels towards the bowed head under the fedora
hat

JUDE
Look just like my daddy

Then the old man’s head begins to rise

And Jude’s pretended attitude seems fatuous His hand begins to
shake

What Jude can see of his face looks nothing like his father
ON THE BRIM OF THE OLD MAN’S HAT -

Tilting upwards uncovering his eyes

ON JUDE -

Who for some reason really doesn’t want to look into those
eyes

HE FORCES HIMSELF TO MOVE -

Up the stairs

As he walks past his leg brushes across the old man‘s knee
ON THE OLD MAN’S EYES APPEARING UNDER THE BRIM OF HIS HAT -
And we don’t want to look at them either

But Jude is already past him

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Jude enters Trying to control his panic Georgia shifts still
asleep from the bed There is another sound now of barking
dogs

Jude goes to the window Sees the dogs barking at him from
their pens across the yard

INT BEDROOM MORNING

Georgia asleep on the bed Her face is pale and sweaty Jude is
kneeling beside her in a robe and slippers He has a band-aid
in his hand and a bottle of disinfectant

He turns Georgia’s hand gently so as not to wake her

JUDE
Not good —

Her finger is swollen and white now the tiny wound festering
and oozing pus He dabs disinfectant on the band-aid and gently
wraps it round her finger

She shifts in her sleep His hand touches her brow stilling
her And we see how much he cares for her even though she
can’t

INT OFFICE MORNING

Danny on the phone Jude stands at the open door the dogs
behind him

DANNY
What’s wrong Chief You look like

JUDE

He walks abruptly back out The dogs follow him

EXT YARD MORNING

Jude walks to where the ball lies in the grass He throws it
again

JUDE
Fetch godammit -

And Angus runs Picks the ball in his mouth Then drops it
again He is looking towards the office door Jude turns sees
Danny standing there gesturing a cordless phone in his hand

DANNY
Thanks so much Can you hold a moment
for Mr Coyne

He hands the receiver to Jude He mouths

DANNY

Florida

Jude repeats the name to himself Florida A hint of a question
mark there as if it reminds him of something He takes the
receiver Danny presses the button to take it off hold

JUDE

She slams the phone down Walks to the window Stands quietly

INT BEDROOM SAME

Georgia turning in her sleep She reaches her hand across the
bed to touch Jude

GEORGIA
Baby -

But her hand comes to rest on the suit Lying where Jude lay As
if it had slept there all night She leaps back suddenly awake

GEORGIA
Not funny -- not funny at all -

JUDE
Anna Anna McDermott
DANNY

JUDE

She cut her wrists The woman I was
talking to was her sister

Danny leans back

DANNY
Oh shit Oh man

On the radio Trent Reznor is singing

NINE INCH NAILS
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel

JUDE
Did you turn that on

DANNY
It’s just the radio Chief

JUDE
I met her backstage at a Trent Reznor
show

The 9 Inch Nails song continues echoing eerily in the room

NINE INCH NAILS
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

Danny doesn’t get it yet

DANNY
She was one hell of a sweet kid Her
and her questions She asked me once
if I had a favorite place to watch the
rain What kind of a question is that

NINE INCH NAILS
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

Jude suddenly pulls the radio plug and all from the desk

DANNY
You want me to call the police

JUDE
What good would that do

DANNY
I heard some messed up shit here

JUDE
What did you hear

DANNY
Whatever you say I heard

Jude smiles

JUDE
No That’s not how I’m gonna handle
this But find anything she left
around here will you

He walks out of the office

INT HALLWAY DAY

Georgia is halfway down the stairs looking like death Jude
enters

GEORGIA
Get rid of it

He looks at her shivering as if with fever Vampire white
skin

JUDE
You sick

GEORGIA
I’m fine Picture of health Get rid
of it The dead man’s suit Didn’t you
notice how it smelled when you took it
out of the closet

JUDE
It isn’t in the closet

GEORGIA
No Was in the bed next to me when I
woke up Smelled like a dead dog Did
you forget to put it back I swear
you’d forget your dick if it wasn’t
attached Must all that dope you
smoked in the seventies

JUDE
You should go back to bed baby You
don’t look well

GEORGIA
No The bed smells like it too It’s
all over the sheets

He goes up the stairs and takes her by the arm

JUDE
So We’‘ll get new sheets

She turns and follows him Then Jude freezes

The dead man is sitting in the Shaker chair His head lowered
as if in some kind of revery His hat on his lap

A shaft of sunlight hits his legs and we can see the chair
through it as if the sunlight bits are not there

GEORGIA
That mightn’t do it Have to fumigate
the whole room

Jude’s heart is thumping He realizes she hasn’t seen the ghost
yet He moves his body to her other side to block off her view

JUDE
Well do that Open the windows Burn
incense

His knee brushes off the space the ghost’s leg occupies
GEORGIA
Incense When did you ever burn

incense That hippy dippy shit

And the ghost’s head is rising now as if in response to the
touch of Jude’s knee

His eyes coming into view to stare at Jude The eyes Jude
couldnt bring himself to look at Where his eyeballs should be
there are black scribbles as if done by a child with a magic
marker

Jude’s hand closes tight on Georgia’s elbow He tries to push
her up the stairs

GEORGIA
Hey - you’re hurting -

She turns towards him The ghost is behind them now

JUDE
Keep walking -

GEORGIA
I’m not going back in there -

And he realizes she can’t see the ghost

JUDE
Please - just do it Georgia - I need
to show you something -

He turns as he pushes her up the stairs Sees the ghost rising
from the chair Placing the hat on his head Bringing the same
hand down with something gold and flashing dangling from it

Jude gets Georgia to the top And the ghost is following him up
the stairs He walks slowly through the streams of sunlight
coming through the open windows Where the sunlight hits his
body it disappears reappears when it hits the shade He dangles
a little curved razor from a chain attached to a ring in his
fingers He flips it a semi-circle so it disappears in the
light then catches it again

Jude grabs Georgia and kicks the bedroom doorway open with his
foot shoving her through

GEORGIA
What are you doing Jude

JUDE
Shut up

INT BEDROOM DAY
Georgia tumbles in Jude comes behind her slams the door shut
The suit is still on the bed

This throws Jude He opens the door a crack sees nothing out
there

Then the tiny razor arcs towards him catching his face in its
reflection

He slams the door shut again as if to break the ghost’s hand
But of course there is nothing there

Turns Sees Georgia staring at him

GEORGIA
What kind of shit are you on

JUDE
Marybeth I couldn’t be more sober

GEORGIA
Thought I was Georgia —

JUDE
Georgia

GEORGIA
Oh the hell Give me what you’re
taking I could use some

JUDE
I got off all my shit years ago I
told you
GEORGIA
You saw something in the hall --
JUDE
And you didn’t -
GEORGIA
No
JUDE

An old man sitting in the Shaker
chair We walked right by him I don’t
know if you can see him

GEORGIA
That’s insane

JUDE
What’s that smell

GEORGIA
I told you The suit

He walks past her past the suit opens the windows And we hear
the sound of dogs barking

GEORGIA
Christ those dogs Noise woke me up
Then that godawful smell Must be a
dead rat in the pocket

Jude pats down the pockets of the suit He feels something
there puts his hand inside

GEORGIA
You found something

JUDE
No

But he is lying He lifts the suit holding it at arms length
between him and her and extracts what he has found We get a
glimpse of a photograph He slips it in his pocket

GEORGIA
Is this all a joke Jude Because if it
is it sucks
He sighs Tries to reassure her
JUDE
A joke yeah Someone sells me a suit
Tells me it’s haunted I believe them
He walks rapidly to the door Pulls it open

JUDE
But there’s nothing there

The empty corridor It very emptiness seems eerie

EXT HALLWAY DAY

Jude standing there in the sunlit hallway the suit in his
hand He walks slowly down the stairs Comes to where the Shaker
chair sits Turns Sees nothing there

Walks through to the studio door Pulls the heavy door open

INT STUDIO DAY

Rows of guitars dobros stringed instruments Jude hangs the
suit on a rack above them

Then he takes from his pocket what he extracted from the suit

We see it now and see why he didn’t want Georgia to see it It
is a photograph

Of Jude and a beautiful girl Anna (Florida) sitting by the
front porch Jude with a Dobro on his knee And Jude’s eyes have
been scribbled over with black pencil

Jude shivers and his eye involuntarily goes to his occult
collection by the wall The noose the foetus the torture-
rack

Among his collection is an old gold-embossed medieval book He
takes it up opens it

We see the title Witchcraft Spirits and Familiars Of Alle
Kindes

He opens it Sees woodcut illustrations of witches demons the
dead

Turns the page Sees a portrait of a dog at point all his
hairs bristling facing a wraith

EXT FIELDS EVENING

Jude walking with the dogs The compound from this vantage
looks beautiful and peaceful

He bends to Angus ruffles his hair

JUDE
You believe in ghosts

The dog slobber on his hand
JUDE

In your dreams huh
INT BEDROOM NIGHT DREAM
Jude asleep with Georgia He is tossing in his sleep And we
know immediately what is happening The ghost is in his dreams
EXT FIELD DAY
Craddock in his suit walking across a scrubby rock-strewn
field He is dangling the blade over the ground watching it
swing as he moves

With him are two young girls Jessica and Anna

ANNA
What does the pendulum do Daddy

CRADDOCK
Finds water darlin’

He stops at a rock The blade begins to swing wildly

Anna stares at the blade

We see her feet on the rock below the blade A liquid is
seeping from the rock round her feet But it is blood not

water

CRADDOCK
See

And suddenly a geyser of blood spouts into the air from the
rock spraying her face She screams
INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Jude sits bolt upward in the bed His tossing has awoken
Georgia

GEORGIA
Can‘t you let me sleep

JUDE

She touches his forehead He is sweating

GEORGIA
Youre all wet baby

She looks at him fully awake now

GEORGIA
Had a dream
He nods
GEORGIA
Tell me
JUDE

Just a dream

GEORGIA
No Tell me what you haven’t told me
About the suit

Jude takes a deep breath

JUDE
I was set up The woman who sold me it
knew what she was doing Her sister
was a fan who committed suicide She
blames me for it

GEORGIA
Youre crazy

JUDE
Maybe But I talked to her today and
Danny was there So maybe he’s crazy

she sent me the suit

GEORGIA

He looks at her in the darkness

JUDE

Believe me you don’t want to
GEORGIA

I saw a ghost once when I was a kid
JUDE

Yeah
GEORGIA

It had black scrawls for eyes
Jude stares at her Doesn’t know what to say
GEORGIA
I can’t believe the dead want to hurt
us Don’t they need our help To talk

JUDE
He didn’t come for talk

INT OFFICE MORNING
Jude enters the office a cup of coffee in his hand

JUDE
Danny -

But there is no-one there Danny’s swivel chair is rocking
slightly as if he left it suddenly

There are photographs and letters scattered all over the floor

by an open filing cabinet

JUDE
What are you on Danny -

He picks up the photographs All of them are the girl from the
polaroid Florida

He picks up the envelopes All of them are addressed to Jude in
a girlish hand None of them have been opened

Jude looks at them wretchedly Then he realises Danny’s
computer in playing the Nine Inch Nails song

NINE INCH NAILS
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

He grabs the mouse taps the sound off Then he looks again at
the photograph in his hand Turns it over There is a name
written there in the same black marker Craddock James
McDermott

He looks from the scrawled name to the computer He can’t stop
himself He sits down Brings up Goggle

Types in CRADDOCK JAMES MCDERMOTT - DEAD
A link comes up to an obituary in the PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL
Jude hits on the link - and there he is
Dressed in the same suit The same close-cropped white hair
The obituary beneath it Jude taps slowly through it
OBITUARY

-was a wide receiver for be

Longhorns in 1965 and enlisted in the

service on graduation in the army’s

psyops division It was there that he

discovered his calling when he was

introduced to the essentials of
hypnosis

Suddenly the computer pings Danny has been sent an email

Jude opens it Sent from CRADDOCK JAMES
MCDERMOOTBOXCLOSETNET

Jude opens it And reads

COMPUTER EMAIL
DEAR JUDE

WE WILL RIDE AT NIGHTFALL WE WILL RIDE TO THE HOLE I
AM DEAD YOU WILL DIE ANYONE WHO GETS TOO CLOSE WILL
BE INFECTED WE WILL BE IN THE DEATH HOLE TOGETHER AND
THE GRAVE DIRT WILL FALL ON TOP OF US LALALA THE DEAD
PULL THE LIVING DOWN --

Jude whacks the computer buttons to turn it off but more of the
obituary comes up in larger print

OBITUARY
Craddock’s interest in spiritualism
led him to experiment with “dowsing”
the old technique of discovering water
sources with the use of a rod or a
pendulum

Now pictures of Craddock come up holding a dowsing rod
swinging a small golden razor blade the golden razor blade
dangled over a finished well --

And Jude stands up to get away from it all and sees Danny
through the window sitting in his car outside

EXT YARD DAY

Jude emerges trying to calm himself He walks towards Danny
sitting in the car Raps with his knuckles on the steamed up

window

JUDE
What are you doing in the car Danny

Danny jumps as if the car has hit a truck He pushes the button
that lets the window down

DANNY
I think I should go home

He can’t look at Jude

JUDE
Did you see him

DANNY
I think I should go home now really

Jude talks with unnatural patience

JUDE
Did you see the dead man Danny

DANNY
I think I have a stomach flu Thats
all

Danny wipes his sweating forehead with his hand It clutches a
letter-opener

JUDE
Don’t you lie Danny I want to know
what you saw

Danny turns his face slowly to Jude He speaks through
chattering teeth

DANNY
His eyes were black marks He looked
right at me I wish he didn’t look
right at me

JUDE
He can’t hurt you Danny

DANNY
You don’t know that You don’t
know

JUDE

He’s not real

DANNY
I was looking for her letters like
you told me Remember those letters

JUDE
Kind of

DANNY
No you don’t Cause you never opened
them And there he was standing
there swinging that thing

Jude reaches his hand in to touch Danny’s shoulder Danny
slashes at him with the letter opener Jude pulls back his hand
just in time

JUDE
Danny

DANNY
Your eyes are just like his

Danny wrenches the car into reverse Jude hops away to stop his
foot being crushed Danny stops then staring at the steering
wheel

DANNY
I’m not coming back
JUDE
Okay
DANNY

Id help you if I could I just can’t

And he reverses the car spins in a half circle and heads up the
drive

Jude stands there watching him go

Then he hers the sound of another car engine turning on and off
He walks around the house and sees Georgia at the wheel of
their large SUV She’s trying vainly to start it

GEORGIA
Godamn this thing -

JUDE
What’s wrong now

GEORGIA
Battery’s gone

JUDE
Cant be Danny just had it serviced

GEORGIA
So where’s Danny

She tries again then bangs the wheel in frustration

GEORGIA
The bedroom stinks The house is
freezing I just need to get to town
for an hour or two

He grips her hand through the open window She gasps in pain
his hand on her damaged finger

GEORGIA
You know that hurts From that pin in
that suit you bought

JUDE
Take the dogs for a walk -

GEORGIA
Do I look like a dog walking kind of
girl
She gets out of the car Slams the door

GEORGIA
Where’s Danny

JUDE
He had some kind of flu Had to take
off

She shivers and looks as if she could break down crying

GEORGIA
This is getting too weird honey -

He holds her
JUDE
Get some fresh air Take the dogs

I‘1l check out the car

GEORGIA
Youll get rid of that suit

JUDE
Yes I promise
EXT FIELDS DAY

Georgia walking the dogs through the mist-filled fields

EXT HOUSE DAY

Jude working on the SUV with the bonnet up He seems to know
his engines He has a trickle charger attached by two jump
leads to the battery The engine is revving sending out clouds
of exhaust

Then the engine inexplicably dies

He rubs the jump-leads but gets no spark

He removes the jump-leads slams down the bonnet

The sound echoes like a gunshot through the fields

The cloud of exhaust from the engine drifts over the fields
through the shafts of sunlight

Through the shafts of sunlight he glimpses a dark suit the
flash of silver buttons

JUDE
(TO HIMSELF )
You tryin’ to close of all the exits
old man

Then the sun goes in and the image if it was ever there
dissipates

He lifts the trickle charger and jump-leads walks over towards
a small outdoor garage Lifts open the door
INT GARAGE DAY

The sunlight spills through the gloom and illuminates a ‘65
MUSTANG beautifully restored

JUDE
(TO HIMSELF )
Maybe you’ve still got spark
Jude walks through and sits in the driver’s seat Takes a key
from behind the rear-view mirror Then sees something from the
past there beside the key A ready rolled joint
He takes the joint lights it inhales

JUDE
See I did inhale

The sensation is a relief after all the paranoia He looks
round at the fittings of the car all now gleaming unnaturally
EXT HOUSE DAY

Georgia walking back to the house with the two dogs She has
decided on something

GEORGIA
You dogs find me that suit now -
INT GARAGE DAY
Jude puts the key in the dash turns it on Presses the

accelerator with his boot The engine roars into life The
garage fills with exhaust smoke

JUDE
There you go

The radio turns on A commercial comes on The sound is raspy
filled with static but we can distinguish some words

COMMERCIAL
You wont find offers like ours
anywhere in the tristate area Come in
and get behind the wheel for your next
ride and take it for a spin on the
nightroad We’ll drive into the hole
together -

On Jude tired exhausted sick of it all

JUDE
How about I shut you up

He turns the dial to find a music station The Beatles sing
I AM A WALRUS

Behind him a gust of window blows through The wind slowly
blows the garage doors closed

INT KITCHEN DAY

Georgia opens the kitchen door The dogs are straining at the
lead hairs bristling

GEORGIA
Go on boys fetch -

She lets them go They run through the kitchen through the
halls Then they throw themselves snarling at the weighty door
of Jude’s studio

GEORGIA
I got it -

She opens the door walks inside The dogs stay snapping by
the entrance

INT STUDIO DAY

The suit hanging from the rail like a malignant part of Jude’s
collection Georgia grabs it from the rail walks it past the
snarling dogs

INT GARAGE DAY

One the car radio The Beatles singing Though the words have
changed

RADIO
I am the walrus -
I am the dead man -

JUDE
That the best you can do

RADIO
Goo goo go juub —
Jude looks through the windscreen And there he is refracted
in the smoke filling up the garage Craddock standing full
figure in front of him

JUDE
You are the dead man

Craddock says nothing

Jude shoves the car into gear Hits the gas pedal But the car
doesn’t move

ON THE CAR’S EXHAUST —

Filling up the garage with smoke

INT KITCHEN DAY

Georgia carries it at arms length through the kitchen Grabs a
squeegee of lighter fluid for a barbecue

GEORGIA
Gonna burn in hell

INT GARAGE DAY

The exhaust of the car still going A Hollyroller is bellowing
on the radio

RADIO
If there is one word that can change
your life my friends - that word is
HolyeverlastingJesus We’ll ride the
glory road together Hallelujah

Jude still hitting the gas Still the car doesn’t move The
dead man is moving slowly towards him through the gathering
clouds of exhaust
JUDE
Have you been messing with my wires
dead man
He hits the gas again

JUDE
You want to ride that glory road

He roars the accelerator again The garage fills with smoke

EXT YARD DAY

Georgia throws the suit down in the dirt Squirts lighter fuel
all over it The dogs snarl as she light and throws a match It
bursts into flame

INT GARAGE DAY

Smoke pouring out of the exhaust now Jude is being overwhelmed
by the fumes

The dead man seen through the windscreen shimmering in the
clouds of exhaust Suddenly he bursts into flame
EXT YARD DAY

The flame consuming the suit The dogs glimpsed barking
through the smoke and flame

INT GARAGE DAY

Smoke pouring from the dead man’s sleeves his collar his ears
His eyes still staring at Jude

JUDE
Hey - you’re burning dead man

The dead man nods as smoke oozes from every pore
Jude hits the pedal The exhaust roars More smoke pours from

the dead man’s nose mouth ears Part of his skin melts It is
as if Jude’s boot on the pedal is causing it
4l

JUDE
Not the dead man any more Burning
man

Jude stares at him through addled eyes

JUDE
We’re going to hell together is that
it

The dead man nods His eyes explode with flame and smoke

And there is another sound in the background now The distant
frenzied barking of dogs

EXT YARD DAY
Georgias empties the lighter-fuel entirely on the burning suit

GEORGIA
How do you like that you stinking
cadaver —

INT GARAGE DAY

And now the dead man is beside Jude flames and smoke crackling
from the cinder block that was his body

Jude can hardly breathe in the smoke that is thick in the
garage

EXT YARD DAY

The last threads of the suit smoking Georgia scatters them with
her boot

GEORGIA
Good work guys

The dogs are still barking but from somewhere else now She

turns sees them snarling at the door of the small garage
Exhaust is pouring from the crack beneath the door

INT GARAGE DAY
Jude looks at the ghost through eyes that are sinking
JUDE
I’m going to sell your suit on To
some other poor bastard

The ghost smiles and sadly shakes his head The radio speaks
for him

RADIO
No refunds No exchanges

Jude shoves the gear stick into reverse with the last of his
energy

JUDE
Says nothing about resale

He hits the gas pedal
HIS POV OF THE GHOST -—
Fading with Jude’s consciousness

Then behind them we see sunlight flooding in The echoing
sound of the garage door lifting

EXTINT GARAGE DAY

Georgia her hand over her mouth by the opening door And
suddenly the Mustang screeches past her in reverse out of the
clouds of exhaust

Jude alone at the wheel barely conscious The Mustang traces a
wild reverse arc and the rear bumper hits the side of the
parked Volvo

Jude’s head snaps backwards hits the headrest Georgia runs
towards him

GEORGIA
Were you trying to kill yourself in
there

Jude raises his head Takes in great gulps of air Then he dry
retches He replies with difficulty

JUDE
No Something was tryint to kill me

GEORGIA
Talk some sense honey please

JUDE
I’m talking sense I know what to do
with that suit

GEORGIA
What
JUDE
We’ve got to sell it on -
GEORGIA
We can forget about that suit I burnt

it
ON JUDE’S FACE —-
He is looking beyond her ice forming over his soul Through the
burning smoke he can see the dead man by the open garage door

The dead man taps his hat and inclines his head graciously
towards Jude

EXT ARENA NIGHT

A sea of eighty thousand waving hands JUDE’S HAMMER are playing
on a distant stage A younger skinnier Jude dressed in leather
belts and chains He is sex on high black boots more so than

INT LIVINGROOM NIGHT

Jude and Georgia in front of the largest television ever seen
They are watching some kind of home video of one of his

JUDE
He isn’t haunting the house He’s
haunting me

GEORGIA

ON THE SCREEN -

The handheld camera tracks through the warrens of rooms
backstage We see a young blonde-haired woman walking gesturing
to the camera to follow She is wearing a western cowboy outfit
with silver stitching a short sexy cowgirl skirt and
embroidered boots

GEORGIA
That her

JUDE
Yep

The camera follows her into the drug-fuelled chaos of an after
concert dressing room

Georgia looking She seems totally unfazed

GEORGIA
And this is all because her sister
thinks it’s your fault Like that kid
who killed himself after listening to
an Ozzy Osbourne song Did you write
a song saying suicide is okay or
something

JUDE
No Neither did Ozzy

GEORGIA
Did she write you crazy fan letters or
something

JUDE
She lived with me for a while Like

JUDE

Jesus your drunk Look around for a
street sign and call a damn cab

He puts the phone down Then he hears it A throbbing sound
outside Of an engine He gets out of the bed quietly so as
not to wake Georgia goes to the window And he sees it

An old green Chevy pickup truck outside a truck built for
running on washed-out swamp roads The lights burning holes
through the night mist The engine is running But there is no-
one at the wheel

Jude speaks to himself

JUDE (SOFTLY)
Where we going old man

The dogs are going wild throwing themselves at chain link fence
of their pens

He opens a drawer in a beside cabinet takes out a 38 Magnum
Makes it for the stairs

EXT STAIRS NIGHT

Jude walks down the stairs slowly Raises the gun to his cheek
looks at the Shaker chair There is no suit on it now but the
Fedora hat sits there like a taunt The sound of the pickup
throbs down here like a drum Jude walks swiftly to the front
door pulls it open and sees the truck there sitting outside
the headlights blazing at him He raises the Magnum is about to
blast at both headlights when the phone rings again shattering
his nerves

He stops himself Looks from the empty truck to the telephone

Then he lifts the telephone Hears Dannys voice

DANNY (0S)
Hey chief -

JUDE
That you Danny Are you still lost

EXT ROAD PAY PHONE

A payphone in the middle of nowhere Lit by the headlights of
the same truck Danny is in the booth

EXT ROAD PAYPHONE NIGHT

The headlights are moving towards Danny in the booth He is
anxious to avoid them

DANNY

JUDE

me Like eyes

He laughs nervously

DANNY
You aren’t as bad as you think Jude

JUDE

DANNY
Your secret is safe Goodbye

JUDE Just wait a while Danny -

But Danny drops the phone leaving it hanging He walks out of
the booth down the empty road The headlights follow him
INT HALLWAY DOOR NIGHT

The Chevy circles slowly and the lights move towards Jude

JUDE
Come on asshole -

He fires the gun at the lights They shatter in an explosion of
sparks And they don’t There is nothing there

Georgia is standing on the stairs terrified

GEORGIA
Jude

He turns gun in hand His expression is murderous

INT FOX NEWS STUDIO NIGHT

Bill O’Reilly hosting the OReilly Factor Images of a car-bomb
in Baghdad

O’ REILLY
One hundred and twenty deaths and as
many wounded We’1ll bring you more as
the situation continues to unfold

He turns his head to the teleprompter

O’ REILLY
Late this evening the Duchess County
Sheriffs department confirmed that
Judas Coyne the popular lead singer
of Jude’s Hammer apparently shot and
killed his girlfriend MaryBeth Stacy
Kimball before turning the weapon on
himself to take his own life

A helicopter shot of Jude’s Farmhouse police cruisers parked
haphazardly in the turnaround and an ambulance backed to the
door of Dannys office

The footage jumps to shots of the dogs in their pens They are
dead blood in the grass around their heads

O’ REILLY
Detectives also believe that Coyne
played a roll in the death of his
personal assistant Danny Wooten who
was found dead in his Woodstock home
also an apparent suicide

Two paramedics walking from the house to the ambulance
Georgia’s tattooed arm dangling from the sagging blue bodybag
they are holding

INT LIVINGROOM NIGHT

Georgia slumped into a chair Jude above her the gun in his
hand O’Reilly continues on the television

OREILLY
Coyne lived the decadent lifestyle of
the rock and roll star to the full -

Footage of Jude’s Hammer at a concert in Houston Jude wears
black jeans and black steel-toed boots bare chested his torso
gleaming with sweat A sea of a hundred thousand half naked
people surge below him a rioting flood of raised fists crowd
surfers tumbling this way and that

Georgia speaks softly
GEORGIA
It isn’t true is it Are we dead Is
that going to happen to us
Jude hits the power button The TV goes off

JUDE
Bullshit

The the TV pops back on O’Reilly speaks on in his relentless
manner

O’ REILLY
The weapon used was a legally held 38
Magnum which he often played with on
stage during his death metal shows

Jude stands walks to the television to silence it with his
boot Then her hears a low moan behind him He freezes

Then he hears a voice Full of static like the voice on the
radio

CRADDOCK
It’s on TV Must be true

He turns and sees the dead man behind Georgia both of his
hands cradling her cheeks from behind

JUDE
You didn’t come for her

CRADDOCK
I’m not going to kill her No sir You
will do that

The dead man smiles O’Reilly’s voice still speaks from the
television

O’ REILLY
A single shot the mouth dispensed with
his girlfriend MaryBeth Tyler whose
stage name was Morphine when she
worked the Manhattan midtown
stripclubs

The dead man swings his razor like a pendulum

JUDE
You don’t want her

O’ REILLY
A suicide note found on the site
expressed regret for what he was about
to do

Georgia tries to move her head but she can’t She is sweating
her eyes terrified but utterly immobile

JUDE
Georgia

OREILLY
-but spoke of voices in his head
that commanded him to do it

Jude walks towards her the gun in his hand He almost pleads
with the dead man who’s voice speaks behind him now from the

TV

JUDE
I don’t want to hurt her Don’t make
me hurt her

O’ REILLY
He placed the barrel of the -38 Magnum
in her mouth in an apparent parody of
a sex act

The dead man’s hands reach out towards the gun The squiggles
dance in front of his eyes

CRADDOCK
You heard the man

The dead man’s hands around Jude’s He draws the barrel of the
gun towards her mouth

JUDE
Please

O’REILLY
»-an act he had referred to
incessantly in his death metal
anthems

Georgia moans terrified

GEORGIA
No

As the dead man places the barrel of the gun in her mouth

CRADDOCK
They always say no Don’t mean it

O’ REILLY
-but the gun was no parody The
bullet was real

And suddenly there is the ear-shattering crash of breaking
glass Through the window shattering in slow motion comes one
dog then another Angus and Bon

The dead man takes a reeling step backwards his face confused
Jude drops the gun And sees —

Angus leaping at the dead man once more But the shape of a the
deg is overlapping with another shape the shape of a black
familiar the same colour as the black marks on the dead man’s
eyes The dead man staggers from it suddenly terrified
staggers into the other dog Bon again ringed by the terrifying
black shape Teeth rip at the dead man’s

outstretched hand Blood falls from the wound drips to the
wooden floor where it sizzles through

EXT HOUSE NIGHT

The dead man tumbles down the porch stairs trying to reach the
Chevy pickup Angus leaps at him again teeth snapping at his
crotch

The dead man howls kicks the black dog off tumbles towards his
truck

He makes it into the door just as the dogs hurl themselves
against it once more The force of their impacting bodies rocks
the truck on it’s wheels

As the truck reverses spins into a semi circle both dogs leap
at it once more But then the truck is gone and their heads
crash into each other They crash down in the frozen mud where
the truck had been

Except the lights of the truck still remain disembodied
defining the night mist The dogs bristle and bark at them
their black familiars vanishing now Until the lights themselves
fade away and the dogs are just dogs once more

Jude walks down the porch into the driveway Bends to both
dogs

JUDE
Something inside you That he’s afraid
of

Georgia emerges through the front door behind him She looks
beyond terrified

GEORGIA
Don’t ask me to stay one more night
here

JUDE

I won’‘t You go pack some clothes
That Mustang’s still working

GEORGIA
Where will we go

JUDE
South To Florida Get that bitch to
call this thing off

EXT MOTORWAY EVENING

Jude driving The wind in his hair One of the dogs in the empty
seat beside him Georgia in the back another dog beside her
Canned Heat playing on the car radio And for a moment things
feel good

GEORGIA
Who are my little hero dogs

JUDE
Read somewhere once that dogs had a
familiar inside them

GEORGIA
Familiar

JUDE
Kind of spirit Protector What do I
know Just know I read it

And he sees something now in the rear-view mirror A pickup
truck headlights poking through the fading daylight And he has
no doubt who or what it is

He suddenly slews across two lanes of traffic towards the
nearest exit

GEORGIA
What did you do that for

JUDE
Getting tired I want to get off the
road before dark

He drives down the Turnpike and looks above him to see the Chevy
pickup continuing on the motorway All he can recognize through
the window is the pale Fedora hat looking towards him

He angles the mirror to check on Georgia She is wrapped around
the dog has not seen it

GEORGIA
There‘’s a motel up ahead

A Days Inn sitting among the Southern trees with their tangle
of Kudzu leaves

And suddenly the Chevy is driving straight at them Georgia
screams Jude swings left into the path of an oncoming truck
barely avoids it rights himself again Swings into the Day’s
Inn car park

GEORGIA
Oh god - what was that -

Jude calms himself Looks at her

JUDE
Chevy pickup

GEORGIA
It was him wasn’t it

Jude looks at the bleak motel frontage A series of adjoining
bungalows A bleak neon light

JUDE
You stay here with the dogs I’1l get
us a room

She looks at him shakes her head

GEORGIA
I can’t

JUDE
I‘ll stay here with the dogs You get
us a room

She shakes her head again

GEORGIA
You and me and the dogs go in there

JUDE
Won’t take dogs in no motel Even this
one

He drives the car and parks it just before the motel entrance

JUDE
Wait here

He walks in The dogs are out of sight of the front office
window

Georgia sits there The dogs nuzzle her

Then a circling headlight illuminates Bon’s panting face
Georgia sits Can’t bear to look around

The headlights fill the back window behind her

The engine dies A door opens and closes

Footsteps coming towards her

Georgia realizes Angus’s head is out the open passenger window
A voice

Bon’s feet padding through the undergrowth the neon sign of
the hotel illuminating it dimly Jude holding the lead
Suddenly the dog stops
JUDE

But Bon seems to sense something in the darkness of the scrubby
forest around
INT BATHROOM NIGHT

Georgia soaps her hair then sinks her head under the water

By the door Angus whines then turns his head towards the
outdoor window He growls pads towards it

The bathroom door swings shut

UNDERWATER

Georgia soaping her hair in the warm bath water
She opens her eyes

Sees through the ripples of the water -

CRADDOCK

The razor dangling from the chain

ABOVE WATER

Georgia’s fingers gripping the sides of the bath

Craddock grips the razor between his thumb and forefinger and
slices through the skin of her wrists

UNDERWATER

Georgia numbed by fear staring at the event Blood streams
from her wrist reddening the water and her vision

Craddock seen through the rippling bloodying water taps his
hat as if to say good day ma’am

And the red blood obscures his image

Georgia can’t keep her breath any longer

ABOVE WATER

Her head bursts through the surface of the bathwater She
screams

EXT HOTEL NIGHT

Georgia’s scream pierces the night forest Jude runs dragging
Angus with him

INT BATHROOM NIGHT

bath tub She can barely speak

Jude holds her wrist It is undamaged And the water around her
is unbloodied

JUDE
Nobody’s cut Tell me what happened

She looks at her wrist At the water in the bath

It accelerates rapidly

DANY
Tell Jude that Anna told me -- Oh lord

The pickup is hurtling towards Danny in the box -

DANNY
She didn’t kill herself - she -

And before he can get the words out the pickup truck slams into
the telephone box destroying it in an explosion of glass and
steel and Danny is dead again

INT CABIN DAWN

He walks into the bathroom Pours hot water to wash his face
JUDE
But an old girlfriend leaving track-—

marks on your wrists

The mirror steams up And an invisible hand is now writing on
the steam Jude stares He says softly

JUDE
I take that back honey

Georgia rises from the bed wrapped in the sheets and comes
behind him

Written on the steam filled mirror is one word FLORIDA

GEORGIA

Assume you didn’t write that

She swings the car suddenly off the road

moment then says softly

GEORGIA
You weren’t lying back there were you
When you said that To her or me

JUDE
No

He clams up again

JUDE
But some things you don’t say twice

INT DENNYS DAY

The place is full of cigarette-smoke As they enter an old man
at a table near the cash desk is talking into an electrolarynx
which he holds to his throat

OLD MAN
You got air-conditioning Well why
don’t you turn it on You don’t bother
to cook the food why you wanna fry
your paying customers

Jude walks with Georgia to a seat at the counter The old man
turns to his equally ancient wife

OLD MAN
I’m eighty seven years old for Christ
sake Their fryin us like eggs --

AT THE COUNTER -

Georgia turns to look at them like the Andrew Wyeth painting
American Gothic

GEORGIA
Think wed look like that if we got
old together

JUDE
Suppose I’d be hairier Like Santa
gone horribly wrong

GEORGIA
Guess a ninety year old strippper’d be
just what you need

The waitress hears this as she spreads menus in front of them
with some distaste

WAITRESS
Coffee

Jude nods hardly noticing her He reaches out a hand to touch
Georgia’s cheekbones

JUDE
With old ladies it’s all about the
cheekbones And the eyes You’ve got
them both

Georgia blushes uncharacteristically She reaches out her cup
towards the waitress with her bandaged hand

GEORGIA
You know Jude sometimes your such a
decent guy I can almost forget about
what an asshole -

As she reaches towards the waitress the waitress is reaching
with the coffee-pot - and pours it over Georgias bandaged hand
Georgia screams

GEORGIA
Want to watch where you’re pouring
that you dumb bitch

WAITRESS
I am so sorry —

Jude reaches for Georgia’s hand but she is already on her way
to the bathroom

JUDE
Accidents happen -

WAITRESS
I am so sorry but that’s no reason
for her to talk that way -

JUDE
She got burnt I’m surprised you
didn‘t hear worse

WAITRESS
I knew what I was serving the moment I
set eyes on you Pair of lowlifes You
payin her by the hour

And every eye in the Dennys is now on him He throws some money
on the counter

JUDE
Keep the change And get your fat ass
out of my sight

He Goes to follow Georgia to the bathroom when he sees the old
man staring at him

JUDE
You got something on your mind

The old man shakes his head takes the electrolarynx from his
throat and places it on the table And suddenly the thing
speaks

ELECTROLARYNX
Yes You will die

His wife stares at it in disbelief

WIFE
It picking up shortwave again

ELECTROLARYNX
The dogs wont save you will kill her
kill yourself we’ll ride together at
nightfall

WIFE
Make it stop Peter -

Jude looks through the window behind them He can see the pickup
truck parked a few spaces from the Mustang
INT BATHROOM DAY

Georgia pushing open the door into the restroom The door bangs
into a man washing his hands by the sink

GEORGIA
Oh I’m sorry —-

The man turns It is the ghost Craddock with his squiggles for
eyes

CRADDOCK
We will be in the death-hole together -

And she slams her fist towards those squiggles of eyes Her fist
passes right through him of course and smashes the mirror
behind into wicked shards of glass She grabs one to protect
herself Then a hand touches her shoulder from behind

GEORGIA
GET OFF ME -—

She slashes towards him But it is Jude not Craddock she is
driving the knife of glass towards He ducks but the glass
slices through his cheek He wraps his arms around her blood
spouting from his cheek

JUDE
Honey - it’s me -

He holds her trying to calm her Blood everywhere Behind them
a woman screams

WOMAN
Oh my God - oh my God -

INT DENNY’S DAY

Jude emerges holding a towel to his streaming cheek with one
hand his other arm wrapped around Georgia As he passes the old
couple the Electrolarynx is still doing it’s thing

ELECTROLARYNX
You will kill her kill yourself the
dogs the dogs won’t save you -

It’s vibrations make it fall off the table landing at Judes
feet He stomps it into bits of useless plastic as he makes it
through the door

EXT DENNY’S DAY

Out they come and are immediately confronted with the spectacle
of the pickup truck which they have to pass to get to the
Mustang A talk-radio station is blaring from the front seat

TALK RADIO
it feels good to embrace those core
American values but it would feel
better to choke that bitch next to you
and throw her on the blacktop in front
of a semi

Jude has his hand on Georgias elbow as they walk past the
sound

GEORGIA
Were going to lose this thing

JUDE
No we‘re not That ghost has a healthy
fear of them dogs

And he makes it to the car opens the door

GEORGIA
If he doesn’t get us now he’1l get us

JUDE
Get in Georgia -

And he pushes her inside Gets in the driver’s seat starts the
car with the towel still pressed to his bleeding cheek

EXT MOTORWAY EVENING

Jude driving south His free hand is holding the towel to his
cheek so he hasn’t put on his seatbelt There are deep forests
to either side of the motorway Georgia is sitting with the dogs
in the back seat

GEORGIA

She untangles a road map Then Jude sees headlights bearing on
him from behind

JUDE
Can’t I call you Georgia in the state
of Georgia We got problems other than

GEORGIA

solution --

The headlights come right up to behind his back fender flooding
the car with harsh light

GEORGIA
Put on your seatbelt -

JUDE
I got one hand to my bleeding cheek
the other to the wheel You do it

As she leans over to do it the headlights pull alongside them
and she can now distinguish the pickup truck

GEORGIA

Suddenly the radio blares into life The Beatles singing I AM
THE WALRUS

bonnet of the wrecked Mustang the safety belt tangled somewhere
round his feet

A pair of hands grip his body Male hands

They pull him off the bonnet drag him through the earth of the
forest floor towards the open door of another vehicle sitting
in it’s own mud-tracks

We recognize the raised tires of the Pickup Truck

We see Craddock now placing Jude’s body in the passenger seat
Slamming the door

Craddock gets in the driver’s seat and the Pickup drives off
on the forest floor

INT PICKUP NIGHT

Craddock driving

recognizable

CRADDOCK

inside Nobody in it

peaceful in the moonlight

Bammy walks into the unnaturally neat livingroom draws the
curtains She takes a Ouija board from a cupboard places it on
the table

BAMMY
You seen one of these before Mister
rockstar

JUDE
No ma’am

BAMMY
It’s a Ouija board Lets me talk to
dead people Sit down the both of
you

They obey her immediately

BAMMY
Place your fingers on the pointer

ON THE OUIJA BOARD —

A circular alphabet A pointer in the centre Two word at
opposite ends of the circle YES and NO

BAMMY
Called a planchette --

She takes Georgia’s and Jude’s hand and places one finger each
on the planchette

BAMMY
Now Introduce yourself

Georgia seems to know the drill She glances at Jude then
begins

GEORGIA
My name is Marybeth Stacy Kimball I
called myself Morphine for a few bad
years and the guy I love calls me
Georgia but Marybeth is who I am my
true name

Bammy looks at Jude

BAMMY
Your turn Your real name now The
true name has a charge to it
(MORE)

BAMMY (contd)
Enough charge to bring the dead back
to the living

Jude takes a breath Feels unutterably stupid

JUDE
My name is Justin Cowsinski I
guess Though I haven’t answered to
that since I was nineteen

Bammy goes still Then intones in a deep voice

BAMMY
We want to talk to Anna McDermott
Justin and Marybeth need your help Is
Anna there Anna Will you speak to us
today

No movement from the planchette And the whole thing suddenly
seems ridiculous

BAMMY
Sometimes those who knew her has to
call

GEORGIA

Jude I mean Justin Call her
Jude takes another breath
JUDE
Anna you around Is there an Anna

McDermott in the house

GEORGIA
Ask her Ask her for real

JUDE
This is so dumb it’s -

GEORGIA
You haven’t tried -

JUDE
Yes I have

And Bammy speaks slowly
BAMMY
No you havent Real names What did
she call you

Jude sighs He tries again

JUDE
Florida Come on and talk to me
Florida It’s Jude darlin’ I’m sorry
I didn’t call you Are you still
waiting for me I’m calling now

And the board jumps beneath their fingers Georgia gives a low
moan Her eyes roll up in her sockets

ON THE BOARD -
As the planchette spells -
W-H-A-T K-E-P-T

And suddenly Georgia speaks in a different voice one that
seems distant and small

GEORGIAANNA
What kept you
Jude shivers hearing the voice

JUDE
What’s happening -

BAMMY
Someone’s talking through her

JUDE
How

BAMMY
Don‘t matter how Who is it

JUDE
It’s her --

And the planchette surges as if in answer
SPELLING OUT —

W-H-Y I-S

Georgia speaks again

GEORGIAANNA
Why is the sky blue

JUDE
She always said she’d rather ask
questions than answer them -

BAMMY
Don’t talk to me - talk to her -

The light is low in the room now as if there’s a storm outside
Jude is overcome by emotion He speaks low as if he could be
talking to both of them Georgia and Anna

JUDE
I’m sorry kiddo I didn’t know how to
help you I wish you’d fell in love
with one of the good guys Someone who
wouldn’t have sent you away when
things got hard -

The planchette moves again A- R- E-Y-O-U

GEORGIAANNA
Are you angry

JUDE
Yes

The planchette swings to the word NO
JUDE
You shouldn’t have done that to
yourself —-

The planchette turns Georgia talks

GEORGIAANNA
Done what

JUDE
Done what You know what No matter
how bad things were between us -

And the Planchette surges back to the word NO

JUDE
What do you mean no

The planchette spells Georgia talks

GEORGIAANNA
What if I can’t answer
JUDE
She can’t answer questions Only ask

them -

And now everything moves into quick time The planchette
whirling Bammy talking in her other voice

GEORGIAANNA
Is he after you

JUDE
Yes He thinks it’s my fault you
killed yourself and he wants to get
even -

GEORGIAANNA
Why are you so dumb

And suddenly the dog whines

GEORGIAANNA
What were you thinking
JUDE
You sayin’ it wasn’t my fault
GEORGIAANNA
Did you ever hurt me
JUDE
I hope not -

And the planchette moves to the word NO

GEORGIAANNA
Can I stop loving you

And the planchette again moves to the word NO

JUDE
Can you tell me what happened

GEORGIAANNA
What’s worse than dying

And Jude gets it

JUDE
Jesus Christ Your father -

GEORGIAANNA
You think he’s my father

JUDE
You mean he wasn’t -

GEORGIAANNA
Why do little girls cry

JUDE
The swine —

GEORGIAANNA
Why me

JUDE

Don’t tell me that Florida - don’t
tell me I sent you back to -

GEORGIAANNA
When will you stop blaming yourself

JUDE
Who else can I blame

And the needle spells one word
STEPFATHER —-

The needle breaks free of the planchette and flies through the
air The dog snarls and leaps scattering the table throwing
himself against the blowing curtains of the window through
which we can see Craddock on the lawns

Georgia gives a low moan and falls onto the floor Jude jumps
down Holds her jaw Her teeth are clamping as if she is having
an epileptic fit

JUDE
Give me a cloth - she’1l bite her
tongue off -

He pulls the tablecloth from the table jams it between her
teeth

INT KITCHEN EVENING

Georgia sits at the kitchen table Jude is making her sip some
of Bammy’s lemonade Georgia is shivering and silent

JUDE
Can I call you aunt Bammy now

BAMMY
Whatever you want Jude

JUDE
You think she remembers any of that in
there

BAMMY
Not in her waking mind

Georgia shakes her head coming to
GEORGIA

happened

JUDE
Why don’t you tell us

GEORGIA

JUDE
Florida

GEORGIA
I was a girl

Georgia holds out her wrists She looks at the scar there

BAMMY
Stay the night Jude

JUDE
Can‘t

BAMMY
Why not

JUDE

Because it isn’t safe

BAMMY
If you ain‘’t gonna stay leave her Go
on without her

GEORGIA
Can‘t stay And don’t ask me Bammy A
friend is dead because he didn’t get
clear of us fast enough

BAMMY
Don’t give up on yourself The dead
win when you quit singing

GEORGIA

JUDE

Georgia hugs Bammy

GEORGIA
I love you Bammy But you have to let
us go

BAMMY

EXT BAMMY’S DAY

An ancient old lady cadillac at the door of her garage There is
a small Prius parked beside it Jude is working on the engine
It sputters into life and black smoke fills the garage

BAMMY
Got a big carbon footprint

JUDE
It knows how to turn How much we owe
you

BAMMY
Whatever Mr Rock Star Just send me
a cheque

EXT HIGHWAY EVENING

A MONTAGE —-

of Jude driving South in Bammy’s Cadillac
A CONVERSATION -

Broken over the hours from dusk to dark
Georgia raises her head from sleep

GEORGIA
Thirsty --

She reaches across the dogs to grab a bottle of Cool Aid

GEORGIA
What if Anna’s sister can’t help us
If she can’t make Craddock’s ghost go
away

JUDE
Why don’t you just rest We’re gonna
be driving awhile
GEORGIA
I don’t want to kill anyone Jude I
don’t want to use my last hours on
earth to murder anyone --

JUDE
These aren’t you’re last hours on
earth

GEORGIA

I don’t want you to kill anyone

take anymore ghosts after me

JUDE
You want some radio

He turns up the radio Dave Grohl sings

GEORGIA
Promise me you won’t kill her Jude No

JUDE

GEORGIA

name Don’t call me Georgia anymore

JUDE

GEORGIA
I wish you didn’t first see me takin’
my clothes off for drunks Throwin’
knives in nothing but high heels I
wish you could have known me before I
got like I am

JUDE
You know how people pay more for
furniture that’s been roughed up a
little Distressed A little wear is
interesting honey

GEORGIA
That’s me Actively distressed

He takes her hand in his as he drives

GEORGIA
If I die Jude and you’re still alive
I’m gonna stop him From the other
side

JUDE
What are you talkin’ ‘bout Youre not
gonna die

She holds out her hands to look at them She has scars now on
both of them

GEORGIA
Got myself another scar

JUDE

GEORGIA
It’s Anna I’m carryin’ her round

JUDE
MaryBeth

He kisses her wrist

GEORGIA

me

She kisses his hand back
GEORGIA
When you’re lovin’ me you’re lovin’
her too Isn’t that a good deal Jude
How can you resist

JUDE
Best deal I ever had

And there are tears in his eyes as he follows the road

EXT JESSICA MCDERMOTT’S HOUSE FLORIDA NIGHT
In a new development of McMansions the house is painted dayglow
yellow among others in assorted ice-cream colours Jude drives

the car past then swings into the garage of an unfinished
house about a hundred yards away

INT CAR NIGHT
Jude turns off the engine

GEORGIA
Do we have a plan

Jude examines the house in the rear-view mirror
JUDE
Looks like tomorrow is garbage day

She hasn’t brought out her cans yet

GEORGIA
So

JUDE
We wait until she carries them out
till she opens that door

GEORGIA
And then

JUDE
You remember speaking in tongues

GEORGIA
You know I don’t

JUDE
Maybe it’s better that way
INT CAR DAWN
The house in the rear-view mirror Georgia speaks from behind
him

GEORGIA
What are you thinking

JUDE
I was wondering which rock star did
the most time inside

GEORGIA
Rick James did three years
JUDE
Ike Turner did a couple at least
GEORGIA
Leadbelly -
JUDE

Broke rocks for ten years For murder

GEORGIA
Don’t say that --

JUDE
If I play my cards right I can do
more than all three of them together

GEORGIA
Prison don’t frighten you

JUDE
Got a lot of fans there

He adjusts the mirror

JUDE
Were on

EXT MCDERMOTT’S HOUSE MORNING

The garage door opening Jessica McDermott who we saw in the
earlier scenes drags out a plastic trash-can and leaves it on
the driveway She goes back inside for some more leaving the
garage door open

When she is out of sight -

JUDE
Wait here -

He gets out of the car takes tyre-iron from the trunk and
stuffs it under his shirt down his pants

GEORGIA
Hell no -
She opens the door

GEORGIA
We just gonna knock on the front door
say hi say hello to my crowbar

Georgia gets out Bon follows her

JUDE
Something like that

He walks towards the house Georgia follows

GEORGIA
What if we just try and tell her - you
never wanted to hurt Anna - never
wanted her to kill herself -

JUDE
That’s not what this is about I’m not
so sure we’re the bad guys in this
story -

And he is through the garage door the dogs loping after him

INT GARAGE MORNING

Jude walks past a cherry convertible And is reaching his hand
to the door into the house when Jessica McDermott opens it
half in half out of the kitchen

JUDE
Howdy —

She reacts instantly Grabs a knife from the kitchen tabletop
and swings it at him He ducks whacks the knife from her hand
and grabs the front of her blouse pushing her inside

INT KITCHEN MORNING

Jessica staggers backwards into the sun-splashed kitchen

JESSICA
If you came to kill me be my guest
He’1ll be on the other side with open
arms -

JUDE
I bet you’re looking forward to it
He swings her round and pinions both of her arms so she can’t
hit at him He talks right into her ear

JUDE
He was kind of possessive about the
two of you -

She struggles Angus leaps on top of her

GEORGIA
Get off her -

She grabs the dog’s collar pulls her back Jessica spits bile
still struggling

JESSICA
You aren’t fit to speak of him He
scraped uglier messes off the heel of
his boot

JUDE
You got that about half right You
both stepped in a pile when you
screwed with me

JESSICA
You think you can best him

JUDE
Maybe not But I can find out the
truth About what I let her come back
to -

JESSICA
The girl who came back wasn’t my
sister You ruined her She was poison
inside -

JUDE
See all along I thought he was her
father Just found out lately what the
real deal was -

JESSICA
Craddock loved her The way he loved
me

JUDE
What kind of love are we talking about
ma ‘am

JESSICA

He was the best man - you turned her -
JUDE
Anna says different I been hearing
from all sorts of dead folks lately

JESSICA
Is she on your case too

JUDE
No She tells me what she couldnt
when she was alive

JESSICA
What does she say
JUDE
Why do little girls have to cry
JESSICA
That one of your lyrics Mr Rock
Star
JUDE

Don’t you get it It’s not me that
hurt your sister It’s him Youve
been punishing me for something he
did

JESSICA
He’d never hurt her

JUDE
He’d been molesting her since she was
a kid It was in front of my face and
I never seen it Her moods Her
dependency She came home to tell you

GEORGIA
Oh my God Am I hearin’ what I think
I’m hearin’

JUDE
The one person who could have helped
her Besides me See we’ve got one
thing in common -

And Jessica goes limp As if she is overwhelmed by this
information

JUDE
That’s what I came here to tell you
So youd call this thing off And I’m
gonna let you go now

He releases his arms

She moves away from him behind the kitchen cabinet Says
softly

JESSICA
What right have you to talk about my
sister

Georgia looks at her wrists

GEORGIA
I’m wearing her scars

JESSICA
You self-mutilating slut You’re the
type cuts herself for fun

JUDE
Your sister killed herself Because
she wanted it to stop Like I want
this to stop

JESSICA
What happened to the suit

JUDE
What does that matter

JESSICA
It’s gone isn’t it And you’re stuck
with him You turned my sister against
him and he won’t stop until you’re
both in the ground -

Angus growls Jude looks down to restrain him
And Georgia screams

GEORGIA
Put it down -

Jude looks up Sees Jessica with a huge magnum pistol which she
has taken from a drawer

JESSICA
Who are you to call him a child
molester How many years have you on
that whore behind you
And there is sudden silence in the room We hear the radio
which has been on all the time

RADIO
what’s Florida’s number one export
You might say oranges but if you did
youd be mistaken

Jude slowly raises his hands

JUDE
You put that thing down now —

JESSICA
How old was my sister when you made
her your whore

JUDE
Twenty And I didn‘t -

JESSICA
She came back like a slut With
attitude Oh you taught her to strut
didn’t you Mister Judas Coyne you
gave her a mouth a filthy one she
accused him of everything in the book
when she came back from you

JUDE
My god - don’t tell me you knew -

JESSICA
She called it abuse - it wasn’t abuse
it was love he loved her the way he

loved me -

JUDE
Please don’t tell me you knew all the
time

The dog moves towards Jessica She swings the gun to protect
herself and BOOM - the enormous cannon in her hand goes off

It throws her one way and the dog another

JUDE
No

Bon flips over backwards with the force of the shot And out of
it’s body now comes the black shadow It curls in the air
leaping towards the sunlight catches every sunbeam on its
glistening black hairs and is gone
JUDE
Youve killed him -

The radio is still droning

RADIO
-wild stallions in Yosemite Park are
starving after months of drought The
dogs the thing Dogs protecting the
sons of bitches and whores that ruined
your sister Shoot the other dog now
and let me at them Death hole’s
waiting gonna drag them down

JESSICA
You poisoned her -

She swings the gun towards him and Angus leaps Jude reaches
his hand out to restrain the dog She fires once taking Jude’s
finger off spraying the wall behind him with his blood As
Angus sails through the air she fires again hitting the dog in
the groin before his body smashes into her throwing her to the
ground sending the gun skidding across the floor

And the radio drones on
RADIO
Holyeverlastingjesus I was good I was
kind and I loved her and whoever blows
that dog to kingdom come will now be
saved

Jude screams through clenched teeth

JUDE
Get that godamned gun -

And Georgia grabs it from the floor

GEORGIA
Oh God -

She trains it with shaking hands on Jessica

GEORGIA
Oh Jude baby -

Jude staggers to his feet Lifts Angus in his bloodied arms
Jessica below him on the floor

JUDE
How does this thing end

JESSICA
Told you already Ends with you both
in a hole in the ground his breath in
your ear -

The dog moans in his arms

JUDE
Not yet

He lurches towards the door

EXT HOUSE DAY

The lawn sprinklers spraying water As Jude and Georgia come
from the front door the water sprays their faces He gets his
foot caught in one of the hoses

JUDE
Son of a bitch -

He wrenches the hose free of it’s tap The water gushes towards
him like an angry fountain

GEORGIA
You need a hospital -

JUDE
No You know why

GEORGIA

screech of tyres

CRADDOCK’S PICKUP TRUCK -

Is steaming towards them from the open garage door Jude
screams at Georgia

JUDE
Move it honey - go -

Georgia turns the keys The engine roars

JUDE‘S POV -

IT IS NOT CRADDOCK’S TRUCK —-—

It a cherry convertible driven by Jessica Price The
convertible hits the picket fence smashes through it gathering

speed slamming over the sidewalk coming straight towards them

Georgia shoves the Mustang into gear the tyres screech the
Mustang takes off as -

The convertible slams into the pylon behind them The white egg

of an airbag explodes from the steering wheel It is sprayed
with blood

INT MUSTANG DAY

Georgia screeches down the tiny street swings onto a larger
one

JUDE

GEORGIA
Did we hurt her

JUDE
No She hurt herself

He pulls bandages from a packet wraps them round his hand
JUDE
I’ll be picking guitar with my toes

before this is over

GEORGIA
I‘1l find a hospital -

Jude tries to tie the bandage with his teeth

JUDE
No hospital Get on the highway

GEORGIA
You could die without a hospital

JUDE
Just drive I can stop my finger
bleeding As long as Angus is alive
we got a chance

GEORGIA
What kind of chance if the dog can’t
move -

JUDE

Craddock’s not scared of the dog He’s
scared of the dog inside the dog Just
get on the highway Go west

GEORGIA
Where west

three hours I’m not going to bleed
out in three hours There’s an old
woman looks after him registered
nurse She’1ll have morphine And he’1ll
have dogs You want to believe it A
whole pound of them Savage bloody
animals

Georgia shivers as she drives She is sweating looks like
death

GEORGIA
Tell me we didn’t cause her to die
Jude
JUDE
No We didn’t The only one we’re
gonna kill’s already dead

The radio is playing some cheesy country music

JUDE
Think they play Garth Brooks in hell
honey

She turns the dial And Craddock’s voice crackles into life

RADIO
I never thought you’d have so much in
the tank boy You don’t have any quit
in you But when that dog in the back
seat quits breathing then so do you -
you and that two dollar whore next to
you -

Jude lifts his foot and slams his heel into the dash Craddock’s
voice is lost in a deafening blast of bass

JUDE
Remember I said the dead man didn’t
come for talk

He smashes it again It goes silent
JUDE
I take that back -
EXT COWSINSKI FARM EVENING
Low Louisiana hills Spanish moss and Kudsu clinging to the live

turnaround a barn to one side old farmhouse to the other

GEORGIA

No reply From Jude who is out of it beside her She reaches
back to touch the dog

GEORGIA
Hey Angus we made it -
But he didn’t The dog feels cold beneath her fingers

GEORGIA
Oh god

And way behind her at the bottom of the hill appear the
floodlights of Craddock’s truck

Jude reaches back for Angus

JUDE

blood smears her nurse’s uniform

ARLENE

She reaches for the phone hits the button impatiently

ARLENE
Cant get a dial-tone

ARLENE
If you’re lucky -

JUDE
Don’t want to sleep -

ARLENE
Afraid you’ll dream of your daddy

JUDE
Something like that -

And she injects him
JUDE‘S POV OF HIS FATHER —-
As the morphine takes hold The old man seems to smile
JUDE
It’s okay old man You’re my bad

dream I’m not yours

He tries to keep his eyes open

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

An an old television set The evening news is playing We see
Arlene’s body in her nurse’s uniform being carried from the
porch by Medics A gunshot wound to her head News cameras
policemen everywhere Yellow tape ringing the farmhouse An
announcer telling the tale

ANNOUNCER
Reports of three perhaps four bodies
on the property One positively
identified as Arlene Carlson working
as a nurse died of gunshot wounds

The camera pulls back to find Arlene looking at herself

INT DADDY’S ROOM NIGHT

Jude sweating lying on a cot beside his father Arlene is
fixing a tourniquet to the bloody stump of his finger

ARLENE
I’m not dead am I Justin

JUDE
Why you ask

ARLENE
TV came on Of its own accord Story
on the news About how we was all
dead You’d shot us -

JUDE
It’s a lie None of it is going to
happen

ARLENE

Then the power went There’s a truck
in the driveway just sitting Old man
in it

JUDE
You stay away from him

ARLENE
I‘1ll have to go to the neighbours to
call the ambe-lance But I’m scared to
pass that truck

JUDE
Don’t mess with that truck Drive
across the lawn and through the fence
if you have to

ARLENE
You need tetanus and antibiotic shots
or gangrene’1l set in

JUDE
Don‘t worry about me

ARLENE
Okay then But you still need them
shots
She stands
ARLENE

Somethin’ bad is going down You want
to tell me ‘bout it

JUDE
I can’t He’ll hurt you too You just
get out of here
Arlene stands
ARLENE
That poor child’s sleepin’ in the

other room

JUDE
Thank you Arlene

ARLENE
And I’m sorry I sold them dogs Miss
the sound of them barkin’

She kisses him on the forehead and goes

EXT FARMHOUSE NIGHT

Arlene’s car making a wide circle round the muddy fields
avoiding the pickup truck

The headlights are on but there is nobody sitting at the wheel
now
INT DADDY’S ROOM NIGHT

Jude on the bed He can hear the departing sound of Arlene’s
car From his expression we know he doesn’t want to think of
what’s going to happen next

Then he hears a sound and he knows it has begun
An old wardrobe against the wall The door slowly creaks open

And there hanging on a hanger among other of his father’s
clothes is Craddock’s suit

The buttons gleam Above the collar it is shrouded in shadow
as if Craddock could still be wearing it

JUDE
What kept you

But his attempt at bravado sticks in his throat

He can hear another sound now from the bed his father lies on
Tortured breathing His father is somehow coming back to life

Movement from the cupboard now The suit is shaking itself free
of dust It moves from the cupboard limbless bodiless It
drapes itself over the body of his father like a virus trying
to find a host As if an invisible tailor is preparing a corpse
for a coffin

Jude stares through his doped eyes fascinated and terrified
His father’s breathing gets louder like a death-rattle

Then his father’s mouth begins to open He speaks slowly at
first in Craddock’s voice

MARTINCRADDOCK
Thought you could pull the tube on me
son

JUDE

She said you wouldn’t suffer none

MARTINCRADDOCK
Oh I suffered alright And I could
hear every word You and Arlene
talking ‘bout starvin’ me to death

JUDE
You were already dead
MARTINCRADDOCK
Well then Not dead anymore

His father’s head begins to turn

MARTINCRADDOCK
So here we are again Just you and
me

His father looks at him But with Craddock’s eyes The effect is
terrifying

MARTINCRADDOCK
All out of road

JUDE
Yeah The fun had to stop sometime

His father’s parched lips smile revealing rotten teeth

MARTINCRADDOCK
Still full of fight sonny boy

His father sits up now wearing Craddock’s suit He reaches out
a bony hand and touches Jude’s cheek

JUDE
You‘’re not my father

MARTINCRADDOCK
Isn‘t that something A thousand
miles you’re singing the same song

Jude is sweating now He tries to pull it together

JUDE
Never gonna stop singing

MARTINCRADDOCK
Dead don’t sing son

JUDE
My daddy couldn’t stop me and boy was
he tough Tougher than you you child
raping son of a bitch

MARTINCRADDOCK
She loved me sonny boy

JUDE
No she went to her grave to get away
from you That’s what this is about
isn’t it

(MORE)
JUDE (contd)
Took me all this time to figure it
out Anna needed me to free herself
from you And you couldn’t stand that
thought

MARTINCRADDOCK
Psychobabblebabblebabble

As the word repeats his face forms many images of itself
glimpse Craddock’s among the faces

JUDE
Maybe But it’s true And I’m only
gonna ask you one thing

MARTINCRADDOCK
One last request

Again the same multiplying effect Jude stares sweating

JUDE
Leave the girl

MARTINCRADDOCK
Oh no Can‘t leave her behind now
She’s going to sit between us when we
ride the night road

JUDE
She’s got no part in this

MARTINCRADDOCK
Where’‘d you find that piece of
jailbait anyways

JUDE
Strip bar In New York

MARTINCRADDOCK
Figures Could never keep your pecker
zipped could you Even when you was
little Remember I took that hammer to
your hand

JUDE
That wasn’t you Was my daddy

MARTINCRADDOCK
Was it your pecker-pulling hand

JUDE
No It was my guitar playing hand

MARTINCRADDOCK
Well do you know what you’re gonna do
with that good hand now

His hand comes up in front of Jude’s face It holds the gold
cut-throat razor of Craddock’s

MARTINCRADDOCK

Youre gonna bloody the floor with

that whore of yours And your daddys

gonna watch
He whips out the blade and holds it in front of Jude Jude can
see his own face reflected in it
INT BEDROOM NIGHT
Georgia lying in bed Asleep exhausted

And there is someone lying in the bed with her Anna

Anna is holding Georgia’s hand stroking the wrist scars there
We see the same scars on her wrist

THE CAMERA MOVES INTO GEORGIA’S FACE -

Framed by Anna’s The effect is erotic and mysterious at the
same time

GEORGIA COMES INTO LARGE CLOSE UP —-
As she wakes

She shivers She is alone in the room

INT DADDY’S ROOM NIGHT
Jude turns away from the blade
JUDE
You just let her go now Do what you

want with me

MARTINCRADDOCK
You saying no to your daddy

JUDE
Always said no to my daddy -
MARTINCRADDOCK
YOU ORNERY LITTLE GUITAR PICKING PUNK
YOU ACTUALLY SAYING NO TO ME

His fury brings Jude right back to his childhood

INT BEDROOM MIRROR NIGHT

Georgia looking at herself in the mirror We see Anna’s face
reflected there

GEORGIA
Help us

Anna’s face mouths the same words as if Georgia is talking to
herself

INT DADDY’S ROOM NIGHT
Jude his father and the blade

JUDE
Okay dad If this is the way you want
it

And Jude whacks him across the jaw An almighty haymaker Judes
father goes flying across the room and crashes into the
wardrobe

JUDE
Wanted to do that since the day I was
born

His father gets to his feet again Blood pouring from his
damaged mouth

JUDE
And you know what It felt good

EXT NEARBY FARMHOUSE NIGHT
A tiny decrepit farmhouse surrounded by forest Anna Mcdermott

is walking towards it towards the barn from which we hear the
yapping of many many dogs
INT BARNPOUND NIGHT

The dogs we saw before in Martin Cowsinski’s pound in
temporary cages Large aggressive-looking creatures yapping and
snarling at each other

The camera drifts towards them Comes the rest on a latch
behind which we see the snarling dogs

ANNA’S HAND reaches down and begins to open the latch

It has a scar round the wrist which seems to pulse with light

INT DADDY’S ROOM NIGHT
Jude’s father coming back towards him
MARTINCRADDOCK
Thought I fixed that hand of yours

years ago -

Jude brings his fist down once more And his father slashes at
him with the razor

MARTINCRADDOCK
Time to cut it right off -

The razor catches Jude across the wrist Jude staggers back

MARTINCRADDOCK
Can still draw blood son -

He strides past Jude towards the open doorway

MARTINCRADDOCK
Now where’s that skinny bitch of yours

And Jude slams his body into that of his father They crash
through the open door into the hallway

INT BARNPOUND NIGHT

ANNA‘S HAND pulls the latch open

Four or five dogs bound out Race through the barn doors into
the night

INT HALLWAY NIGHT

They slam against the door of the hallway Jude’s father brings
the razor down again Jude grabs his wrist with his good arm

JUDE
You touch her I‘11 kill you -

MARTINCRADDOCK
But I’m dead son I’m dead -

Jude twists his body slamming him backwards towards the kitchen
door
INT BARNPOUND NIGHT
THE WOMAN’S HAND opens cage after cage The dogs run into the
night
INT HALLWAYKITCHEN NIGHT
JUDE STAGGER BACKWARDS AS -
His father slashes at him with the open razor
MARTINCRADDOCK
Same old story Daddy gives hima
chore Little Justin won’t do it
Daddy picks up the slack You ever
gonna learn son

The razor catches him across the shirt drawing blood

MARTINCRADDOCK
Do your own slicing and dicing -

Jude tumbles into the kitchen as his father follows with the
razor Then suddenly a kitchen knife sprouts from his chest

He groans dully looks down and up and sees -

GEORGIA STANDING BY THE MAGNETIC KNIFE RACK

She snaps another wide-bladed knife from the rack Throws it
expertly It thumps into the old man’s neck sprouting blood

She grabs another knife and comes towards him Jude screams

JUDE
Keep away - he won’t lie down and die -
His pulls the knives out speaking in Craddock’s voice

MARTINCRADDOCK
You will die she will die well all
ride the nightroad together --

Georgia throws another knife This time he ducks and it sticks
itself in the wall He brandishes both bloody blades sharpening
them off each other

MARTINCRADDOCK
Remember hog-guttin’ time son

He comes towards Georgia both bloody blades flashing
MARTINCRADDOCK
Always cut from the crotch upwards

Guts fall out all on their own -

Georgia grabs another knife although she knows it will be
useless

GEORGIA
Goodbye Jude - nothin’s gonna stop him

And suddenly he stops He hears the sound The barking yapping
of many many dogs

INT DADDY’S ROOM NIGHT

The glass panes of the windows shatter as one dog comes through
it then another then another

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

The dogs leaping down the stairway towards whatever Jude’s
father has become Their black shadows leap out of them as the
dogs surge towards the bleeding apparition

He turns

One dog leaps for his crotch

Another black spirit dog emerges from it as it leaps and goes
for his throat

Jude’‘s father staggers back from the dogs hits the double doors
and tumbles down the porch

EXT FARMHOUSE NIGHT

The dogs pile through bent on mayhem Black spirit doubles
emerge from each of them surge towards Jude’s father

A pair of arms reach out to wrestle with the black dogs A face
screams in agony We recognize Craddock

The body of Jude’s father falls inert on the ground

And there is a dark figure above the body now wrestling with
the dogs Craddock the ghost trying to beat off the ghost
dogs

CRADDOCK TEARS A GHOST DOG FROM HIS BLEEDING NECK -

TRIES TO REACH HIS PICKUP TRUCK -

BUT DOG AFTER GHOST DOG PILES ON TOP OF HIM -

THEY WRAP AROUND HIM LIKE SCARVES OF SMOKE —

BLACK TEETH TEARING FLESH FROM HIS BODY -

DRAGGING HIM LIKE THE DOGS OF CHARON DOWN TO SOME HELL —

CRADDOCK BACKS AWAY FROM THE TRUCK -

AS IF TO ESCAPE HIS GHOST FORM SURGES ONCE MORE DOWN INTO THE
BODY OF JUDE’S FATHER -

THE CORPSE GOES RIGID AS IF HIT BY A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY THEN
GOES ABSOLUTELY STILL
EXT PORCH NIGHT

Jude and Georgia standing by the door looking down in
amazement

The pickup truck is gone Twenty or so snarling real dogs
around the body of his father

They seem to be standing on guard to prevent what may emerge

JUDE
Who let those dogs out

GEORGIA
She did

JUDE
Arlene

GEORGIA
No She did There

She points He looks up He sees a figure standing in the muddy
ruts where the truck was Florida Anna May Mcdermott

A beautiful melancholy figure A true ghost
Her mouth moves We can’t hear what she says
But Georgia interprets
GEORGIA
She wants to know when you’re going to

stop blaming yourself

Jude stares at the face of his old girlfriend A hundred
conflicting emotions on his face

JUDE
From now on darlin’

Anna May’s mouth opens again soundlessly

GEORGIA
You promise

Jude puts his arm around Georgia and nods

JUDE
I do

And Florida Anna May McDermott vanishes into thin air as if
she was never there

Only the dogs left snarling round his father’s body

One of them moves forwards begins to worry with his teeth at
his father’s boot

Jude walks slowly down the stairs pulls the dog away

JUDE
Get away there fella Thats my
daddy

He touches his father’s face Turns it over He is quite the
dead corpse now
JUDE
Correction Was my daddy

And suddenly the telephone rings from inside

GEORGIA
Don’t answer it

Jude looks at her The phone keeps ringing
JUDE
Might be Arlene
INT KITCHEN NIGHT
The telephone ringing
Jude walks back into the kitchen

He walks to the old-fashioned phone Holds his hand for a
moment Then picks it up

JUDE

JUDE

DANNY (0S)

JUDE

JUDE

privacy for a while

DANNY (0S)

JUDE

He puts down the phone Georgia comes to him through the
bloodied kitchen She takes his hand

INT COFFIN DAY

CLOSE ON THE FACE OF JUDE’S DEAD FATHER —

A strip of sunlight illuminating the face There is the sound of
earth falling down from above The earth blocks out the light

and we are in the darkness the relentless sound of falling
earth continuing

EXT FIELDSFARMHOUSE DAY

Jude with Georgia and Arlene A freshly-dug grave the coffin
inside it Jude is shovelling the earth

GEORGIA
Don’t we say a prayer

JUDE
Don’t know any Just songs

GEORGIA
Sing one then
Jude begins to sing as he shovels
JUDE
Tombstones is my pillow cold grounds
is my bed
Tombstones is my pillow cold grounds
is my bed
INT COFFIN DAY
Absolute darkness down here The very distant sound of singing
JUDE Early one morning death walked in my
room —-

Then the unmistakable sound of slow tortured breathing

EXT FIELDSFARMHOUSE DAY
Jude Georgia and Arlene Jude still digging and singing
JUDE
Early one morning death walked in my
room --
A figure behind them none of them seems aware of It is Jessica
Price Dead Just as we left her in the accident Blood streaked

face Blood matted hair

THE END
