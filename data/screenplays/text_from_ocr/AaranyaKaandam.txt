1 INT SINGAPERUMAL’S HOUSE (PRIVATE AREA)- DAY

It’s an old house in north Madras with lots of tiny rooms
and dark passages completely run down paint faded
revealing a lot of wall texture and furnished by old
wooden stuff It’s around 8am in the morning A retro song
(aatathil nee than aha raja raja) is playing in the
background

Single long choreographed shot

SUBBU a nubile young woman leaves the bathroom after
having her bath She starts wrapping her sari in the
dressing area

SINGAPERUMAL aka AIYAA a despicable looking old man
with sharp fierce features coughing incessantly is
shaving his face He sees Subbu changing through the
shaving mirror He leaves his razor on the tray and turns
towards Subbu He starts to lecherously fondle her from
behind Subbu is frozen mildly disgusted with her
predicament

He tries really hard to make out with her She doesn’t
protest but lies like a log of wood He’s unable to attain
an erection He breathes hard coughs and gathers flem as
he tries to do herhe just could not fuck her

A disgusted helpless silly Subbu looks at his crotch in
fear and disgust
Aiyaa infuriated by her look(trying to hide his weakness)
slaps her tight She looks thoroughly hapless In a low
voice filled with self pity-

SUBBU
Ungallukku mudiyalena enna en
adikareenga

He punches her even harderblood seeps out of her lips The
background retro music grows louder and reaches

unbearable decibel Aiyaa gets up and storms out of the
room

2 INT SINGAPERUMAL’S HOUSE (BOYS ROOM) - DAY

Another run down room with very sparse furniture- a few
benches a significant chair a roll top desk with an old
record player and a bunch of retro records on it Old
photographs adorn the walls

ROBIN a lean mean Anglo-Indian guy wearing a figure
hugging TShirt which reads ‘Saturday Night Semma Tight’
is scanning through his records playing the music

Other guys in the room are chatting and laughing

NAGARAJ a Slimy looking guy is playing cards with
CHITTU who has a boyish charm about him Chittu looks
pretty hippy in retro clothes and styling PASUPATHY a dynamic looking smart guy is on the phone

Aiyaa enters in full fury and shouts at Robin

ATYAA
Chi Mairu

Robin looks terrified as he stops the record player Every
body becomes silent as they watch Aiyaa go back to his
room closing the door behind him

The atmosphere becomes normal again

SAPPAI a vulnerable looking lean guy with an innocent
face and a clueless expression serves tea to the guys
Nagaraj gets back to his game of cards after having a sip
of tea He looks at Chittu-

NAGARAJ
“Dei Chittu nee continue pandra”

weak retort

exaggerated surprise in his voice-

They laugh Pasupathy looks at them with mild irritation
Nagaraj pats Sappai on his shoulder-

NAGARAJ

5 INT BAWA LODGE KAALAYAN’S ROOM- DAY

It’s a seedy little room with dirty peeling wall paper
faded linen and flooring stained by all sorts of stuff
There’s a single tiny cot in the centre and a dirty door
with filthy stickers and graffiti On one corner of the
room is’ a nice handsome ‘seval’rooster watching
everything quietly

In the other corner are a large bunch of empty liquor
bottles a yellow bag with god picture on it cigar food
etc

KAALAYAN a thin famished guy with drooping moustache
and a crazy glint on his eyehis modulation is like that of
young vkramasamy Wearing white dhothi and baniyan he is
still drinking

An OLD MAN who is really short and fat that his girth
and height are more or less equal looks more drunk chatting
away with Kaalayan Half way through their conversation-

shoulders enters with just a thundu wrapped around his hip
hair wet after his bath Kaalayan turns to look at his son

The boy sees his dad and his friend still drinking With
anger in his eyes he goes and hits the seval with his
thundu-His eyes still fixed on the old man

ODUKAAPULI

endearingly Kodukaapuli snatches the seval from his dad

and snaps at him-

Kodukapuli looks at them with disgust Both continue to
drink

OLD MAN

He stands up nods goodbye But just turns around lies
down and falls asleep right there Kaalayan sees this and
giggles
KALAYAN
Mabbu mabbu ha ha ha

He passes out while pointing his finger at the old man
his giggle freezes and vanishes finally Kodukaapuli looks
helpless as he watches the two drunk men

Amidst silence suddenly the alarm goes off Kodukaapuli
wakes his dad He drags his semi-conscious dad to the

bathroom washes him and puts fresh clothes on him By now

Kaalayan is a bit sombre Kodukaapuli applies ‘thiruneer’
on his dad’s forehead and they leave the room

12 INTEXT SONG (ROADS KOZHI FIGHT ARENA SP HOUSE-
PRIVAREA) DAY

A song starts off as Pasupathy runs with the police chasing
him frantically In between he tries calling his girl
friend Song is to be mixed with “This line is busy-Please
try again laterSame thing in Tamil” (Acid Rave kind of
music)
While Pasupathy is running parallely the Maruthi van
travels with the other guys Kozhi fight happens between
Aiyaa’s kozhi and some other kozhi Kaalayan and
Kodukkapuli watch the fight impressed with Aiyaa’s kozhi
Aiyaa looks at Kaalayan’s kozhi patronizingly Cuts between
all this and Pasupathy running

BGM1 Subbu and Saapey taking a small break feeling a bit
awkward looking at each other breathing heavily
(exaggerated) after the love making session Subbu just
gets up with a sheet around her Sappai looks at Subbu
through a mirror and winks with the pride of an acheiver
Subbu blushes Sappai pulls her sheet playfully She just
comes and wraps around him in full fervour like a kid

Cut to Pasupathy running He thrashes a biker and makes
away with the bike The police are out of sight

BGM2 Cut back to kozhi fight arena Aiyaa’s kozhi
gloriously wins over the other kozhi
Time Splice shot of Aiyaa’s kozhi jumping Aiyaa is
gloating in pride As the music intensifies both Pasupathy
and his gang in the Maruthi van head towards Kasthuri’s
house Pasupathy driving like a maniac crashes the bike
does two stylish summersaults on his bike and then his head
hits the ground in slow motion

13 EXT KASTHURI’S HOUSE DAY

It’s a lively market area with lots of vendors and filled
with people bustling across A lot of crowd is gathered
around the main attraction the kozhi fight The crowd
comprises mostly of men and a few children who are
completely awe struck A couple of local thugs are
exchanging bet money Few other guys are holding their

sevals and waiting to fight In the arena Aiyaa’s seval is

fighting with Kaalayan’s seval The fight is pretty fierce
with Aiyaa’s seval fighting really well dominating
Kaalayan’s seval Aiyaa is watching with pride along with
Nagaraj and his men Kaalayan is very upset and slowly
starts abusing his seval

KAALAYAN

Kodukkapuli is a bit embarrassed about his father but
keeps mum Aiyaa smirks at them the crowd screams
cheerfully for Aiyaa’s kozhi

KAALAYAN

His voice trails off as his attention shifts to the kozhi
fight Slowly Kaalayan’s kozhi gives an arrogant look
towards Aiyaa’s kozhi (exaggerated expression) and starts
its attack Kaalayan’s expression and behaviour change from
one of helpless grumbling to arrogant optimism

KAALAYAN

The loud cheerful crowd becomes silent when Kaalayan’s
kozhi starts to dominate Aiyaa’s kozhi The air is tense
and Nagaraj and Aiyaa’s men are restless Aiyaa looks down
in embarrassment

Kodukkapuli notices all this sees that Aiyaa is no
ordinary guyand tries to silence his dad by giving him
looks and gesturing him to shut up But Kaalayan doesn’t
get it and gets close to Aiyaa and pats him to comfort him

KAALAYAN

Aiyaa suddenly picks up the Aruvaal next to him in a fit of
anger and charges towards Kaalayan who looks shell
shocked The crowd is totally shocked and silent Aiyaa’s
face and the stroke of the Aruvaal seem as if he is going
to chop off Kaalayan’s head but Aiyaa severs the head of
Kaalayan’s seval its blood spashing on to Kaalayan’s
frozen face

Total silence and shock in the aircrowd is shell shocked
Kodukkapuli is speechless and Kaalayan drops down to the
