the harvest

streaks the sky Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
ashes into the pot to cool the solution

connections in Colombia and they needed
to find someone to help them transport
cocaine into America

we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
shelled suitcases

cabinet paper and duct tape that way
if there were any dogs in customs

Stevens who helped us fly 300 kilos of
cocaine per week into the United States
via twin-engine Cessnas Jack would fly
into North Carolina wed meet him there
and drive it down to different
distribution points

GEORGE (CONTD)

I never met Pablo Escobar Diego
Delgado was my only connection to
cocaine from Colombia

GEORGE (CONTD)
Diego convinced me to keep most of my
money in a Panamanian bank Diego had a
close relationship with Manuel Noriega
In exchange for allowing us to keep our
money there we paid him a percentage

GEORGE (CONTD)
There was an 85 chance that if you
snorted cocaine between 1977-1984 it
was ours Initially with my LA
connections we invented the
marketplace In 1977 there was no
other real competition

GEORGE (CONTD)
The first year we made about 100 million
dollars between us It was an expensive
operation Eventually we built up to
three different pilots doing multiple
runs per week connections on both
coasts everything was running smooth
We were like a corporation

GEORGE (CONTD)
he was very anti-government He talked
about revolution forming his own
country or island he was looking for
power as well as money I was just
looking for money

GEORGE (CONTD)
He disliked the United States thought
it was a police state He hoped that by
flooding the country with cocaine it
would disrupt the political system and
tear down the morality of the country

GEORGE (CONTD)
Well yes Derek Foreal was my
connection I met him back in 1968 when
I first moved to Manhattan Beach It
was Foreals marijuana connections that
kicked off our cocaine market

GEORGE (CONTD)
Yes it was my idea to bring the kilos
to Los Angeles When Diego finally got
Derek Foreals name from me it was only
a matter of months before hed cut me
out

GEORGE (CONTD)
Im not sure how my relationship with my
daughter and ex-wife have anything to do
with this trial I mean were here to
talk about Diego Delgado arent we

GEORGE

sentence in half Ill be seventy-three
years old Thats some fucking deal I
dont know if the parole board the
judge the pope or Jesus Christ himself
can get me out of here I have a really
bad record Im not sure whats going to
happen

CALIBANOS
So you do have an agreement with the
United States Government Mr Jung
correct

George cant respond Looks to Diego Looks from the jury
the judge George is on the spotlight and its uncomfortable

He feels suddenly sleazy

CALIBANOS (CONTD)
I thought so No more questions

Silence The judge tells George he can step down
laughs quietly with associates George is bummed

by Diego They look at each other

GEORGE
You shouldnt have taken the 30 million
Diego I was out
