INT BEDROOM EARLY-MORNING HOURS
A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed
A CLOCK reads twenty to six

A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dantes Inferno
Beyond Good and Evil The Catcher in the Rye and The Dark
Knight Returns A FRAMED DIPLOMA dusty and unkempt hangs
askew on the wall A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
corner and a bra weighs one end down A PHONE sits quietly
atop a bundle of laundry It suddenly explodes with a
resounding ring-once twice three times A CLOSET DOOR
swings open and a half-clad figure falls out THE PHONE
rings yet again and a hand falls upon the receiver yanking
it off the trash can OC THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his
back to the camera phone in hand

FIGURE

THE DOG yawns and shakes its head

FIGURE (0C)

A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy The picture is
decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache

FIGURE (0C)
Swear youll be in by twelve and
Ill do itTwelveTwelve or I

THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle THE RUMPLED FIGURE
slowly sits up and remains motionless He musses his hair
and stands

THE DOG stands and wags its tail A hand pats its head The
Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed We now see his face It
is the face of DANTE and this is Dantes room this is
Dantes life DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it

DANTE
Next time I get the bed

He releases the dog and sits up
DANTE
(exhausted)
Shit

A steaming shower fills the room The dog licks water from
the toilet

CUT TO
INT KITCHEN MINUTES LATER

A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside He
grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door

INT KITCHEN SECONDS LATER

Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler One scoop two
scoops three scoops four scoops

CUT TO

A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street

EXT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING

The car pulls up with a screech Feet descend to the ground
from the open door Keys jam into a lock and pop it open

Cut TO

DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door He opens
it and grabs two bundles of papers throwing them inside the
store

CUT TO
INT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING

A very dark room barely lit by the daylight Suddenly the
lights flick on revealing the glorious interior of the
convenience store THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
camera quickly THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a
knife Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks One rack
remains empty A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot
Ground coffee follows and the mix is shoved into place in
the coffeemaker The switch is flicked and the machine comes
to life The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
papers DANTE rubs his chin and stares puzzled He rolls
his eyes as it occurs to him

DANTE
Shit

The register pops open and a hand extracts a quarter

Cut TO
EXT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING
POV NEWSPAPER MACHINE

Through murky glass and thin metal grating we see DANTE
approach He stops and drops a quarter in the slot He pulls
the door down finally allowing us a clear view as he
reaches toward the camera

DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
vending machine He struggles to hold them all in one hand
as he lets the door slam shut He turns to walk away but
the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
him He takes a step back to grab the coin

Cut TO

INT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING

The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
flop The quarter drops back into the register drawer

CUT TO
EXT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING

DANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock He
looks down at it

DANTE
Shit

The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and
obtrusive like gum preventing the key from being inserted
DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily The car
trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside pulling out a
folded white sheet

CUT TO
INT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING
A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf DANTE dips
his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on

the unfurled sheet leaning on the cooler

Cut TO
EXT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING

DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the
sheet under the awning He jumps down The banner reads I
ASSURE YOU WERE OPEN The door sign shifts from CLOSED to
OPEN

CUT TO
INT CONVENIENCE STORE MORNING
The clock reads 620 DANTE leans behind the counter the
morning routine completed He stares ahead catatonic then
drops his head in his hands The day has begun

morning hour just after dawn A car drives by

has become something of a rally

ACTIVIST
Youre spending what Twenty
thirty dollars a week on cigarettes

LISTENER 1
Forty

LISTENER 2
Fifty-three

ACTIVIST

Fifty-three dollars Would you pay
someone that much money every week
to kill you Because thats what
youre doing now by paying for the
so-called privilege to smoke

LISTENER 3
We all gotta go sometime

ACTIVIST
Its that kind of mentality that
allows this cancer-producing
industry to thrive Of course were
all going to die someday but do we
have to pay for it Do we have to
actually throw hard-earned dollars
on a counter and say Please
please Mister Merchant of Death
sir please sell me something that
will give me bad breath stink up
my clothes and fry my lungs

LISTENER 1
Its not that easy to quit

ACTIVIST
Of course its not not when you
have people like this mindless
cretin so happy and willing to sell
you nails for your coffin

DANTE
Hey now wait a sec

ACTIVIST
Now hes going to launch into his
rap about how hes just doing his
job following orders

(MORE)
ACTIVIST (CONTD)
Friends let me tell you about
another bunch of hate mongers that
were just following orders they
were called Nazis and they
practically wiped a nation of
people from the Earthjust like
cigarettes are doing now Cigarette
smoking is the new Holocaust and
those that partake in the practice
of smoking or sell the wares that
promote it are the Nazis of the
nineties He doesnt care how many
people die from it He smiles as
you pay for your cancer sticks and
says “Have a nice day

DANTE
I think youd better leave now

ACTIVIST
You want me to leave Why Because
somebody is telling it like it is
Somebodys giving these fine people
a wake-up call

DANTE
Youre loitering in here and
causing a disturbance

ACTIVIST

Youre the disturbance pal And

the counter)

no longer loitering Im a customer
a customer engaged in a discussion
with other customers

LISTENER 2
(to DANTE)
Yeah now shut up so he can speak

ACTIVIST
Oh hes scared now He sees the
threat we present He smells the
changes coming and the loss of

sales when the nonsmokers finally
demand satisfaction We demand the
right to breathe cleaner air

LISTENER 3
Yeah

ACTIVIST
Wed rather chew our gum than
embrace slow death Lets abolish
this heinous practice of sucking
poison and if it means ruffling
the feathers of a convenience store
idiot then so be it

DANTE
Thats it everybody out

ACTIVIST
Were not moving We have a right
a constitutional right to assemble
and be heard

DANTE
Yeah but not in here

ACTIVIST
What better place than this To
stamp it out you gotta start at
the source

DANTE
Like Im responsible for all the
smokers

ACTIVIST

The ones in this town yes You
encourage their growth their habit
Youre the source in this area and
were going to shut you down for
good For good cancer-merchant

The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTEs face
CROWD
Cancer merchant Cancer merchant

Cancer merchant

VERONICA enters and surveys the mess The CROWD throws
cigarettes at DANTE pelting him in the face Suddenly a
loud blast is heard and white powder explodes over the
throng Everyone turns to face

VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases holding
a fire extinguisher

VERONICA
Whos leading this mob

The CROWD looks among themselves Someone points to OC

SOMEONE

The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward
the door

VERONICA (0C)

VERONICA jumps off the freezer case training the nozzle of
the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST

VERONICA
Lets see some credentials

He reaches into his briefcase She pokes the extinguisher
nozzle at him warningly

VERONICA
Slowly

He pulls out a business card and hands it to her She reads
it

VERONICA
Youre a Chewlies Gum
representative

He nods
VERONICA
And youre stirring up all this
antismoking sentiment

towhatsell more gum

He nods again
VERONICA
(through gritted teeth)
Get out of here

He quickly flees She blasts him with more chemical as he
exits

VERONICA
(to the crowd)
And you people Dont you have jobs
to go to Get out of here and go
commute

The CROWD sheepishly exits one by one offering apologetic
glances DANTE tries to regain his composure

VERONICA watches the crowd disperse disgusted

VERONICA
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Easily led automatons Try thinking
for yourself before you pelt and
innocent man with cigarettes

The last of the crowd exits VERONICA sets the fire
extinguisher down next to DANTE DANTE is sitting on the
floor head in his folded arms

VERONICA
It looked like Tiananmen Square in
here for a second

DANTE is silent

VERONICA
Thank you Veronica you saved me
from an extremely ugly mob scene

DANTE remains silent

VERONICA
(sits beside him)
Okay champ Whats wrong

DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look
VERONICA

All right stupid question But

a bit too hard

DANTE
Too hard I dont have enough
indignities in my life-people start
throwing cigarettes at me

VERONICA
At least they werent lit

DANTE

CUT TO
INT CONVENIENCE STORE DAY

A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads

DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor behind the
counter VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms his head on her
chest Change is heard hitting the counter

DANTE
(to OC customer)

The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving

VERONICA
How much money did you leave up

DANTE

time of morning

VERONICA
Youre trusting

DANTE
Why do you say that

VERONICA
How do you know theyre taking the
right amount of change Or even
paying for what they take

the counter and nobody around they
think theyre being watched

VERONICA
Honesty through paranoia Why do
you smell like shoe polish

DANTE
I had to use shoe polish to make
that sign The smell wont come off

VERONICA

Making a male climax is not all
that challenging insert somewhere
close and preferably moist thrust
repeat

VERONICA

lies a challenge

standard A guy makes a girl cum
its talent

DANTE
Something wrong

VERONICA
Im insulted Believe me Don Juan

guy off Just being there-as you
put it-is not enough

DANTE
I touched a nerve

VERONICA
Im astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life

DANTE
It wasnt directed at you I was
making a broad generalization

VERONICA
You were making a generalization
about broads

DANTE

experiences with the few women who
were good enough to sleep with me

DANTE
Sylvan can be talked into anything

A moment of silence as DANTES chuckles fade to comprehension

DANTE
You sucked that guys dick

VERONICA
Yeah How do you think I know he
liked
DANTE
(panicky)

Butbut you said you only had sex
with three guys You never mentioned
him

VERONICA

him
DANTE
You sucked his dick

VERONICA
We went out a few times We didnt
have sex but we fooled around

DANTE
(massive panic attack)
Oh my God Why did you tell me you
only slept with three guys

VERONICA
Because I did only sleep with three
guys That doesnt mean I didnt
just go with people

DANTE
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous

CUSTOMER
In a row
DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door

DANTE
Hey Where are you going

VERONICA
Hey listen jerk Until today you
never even knew how many guys Id
slept with because you never even
asked And then you act all
nonchalant about fucking twelve
different girls Well I never had
sex with twelve different guys

DANTE
No but you sucked enough dick

VERONICA
Yeah I went down on a few guys

DANTE
A few

VERONICA
And one of those guys was you
The last one I might add which-if
youre too stupid to comprehend-
means that Ive been faithful to
you since we met All the other
guys I went with before I met you
so if you want to have a complex
about it go ahead But dont look
at me like Im the town whore
because you were plenty busy
yourself before you met me

DANTE
(a bit more rational)
Wellwhy did you have to suck
their dicks Why didnt you just
sleep with them like any decent
person

VERONICA
Because going down its a big deal
I used to like a guy wed make
out and sooner or later Id go
down on him But I only had sex
with the guys I loved

DANTE
I feel sick

VERONICA
(holds him)
I love you Dont feel sick

DANTE
Every time I kiss you now Im going
to taste thirty-six other guys

VERONICA violently lets go of him

VERONICA
Im going to school Maybe later
youll be a bit more rational

DANTE
(pause)
Thirty-seven I just cant

VERONICA
Goodbye Dante

She exits in a huff DANTE stands there in silence fora
moment Then he swings the door open and yells out

DANTE
Try not to suck any more dicks on
your way through the parking lot

Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside
double back and head in the direction VERONICA went

DANTE
HEY HEY YOU GET BACK HERE

DANTE
You dont want to know

RANDAL
You called Caitlin again

DANTE
She called me

RANDAL
Did you tell Veronica

DANTE
One fight a day with Veronica is
about all I can stomach thanks

RANDAL
What do you two fight about

DANTE
I guess its not really fighting
She just wants me to leave here go
back to school get some direction

RANDAL
(opening paper)
Ill bet the most frequent topic of
arguments is Caitlin Bree

DANTE
You win

RANDAL
Im going to offer you some advice
my friend let the past be the past
Forget Caitlin Bree Youve been
with Veronica for how long now

DANTE
Seven months

RANDAL
Chicks nuts about you How long
did you date Caitlin
DANTE
Five years

RANDAL
Chick only made you nuts She
cheated on you how many times

DANTE
Eight and a half

RANDAL
(looks up from paper)
Eight and a half

DANTE
Party at John Ks-senior year I
get blitzed and pass out in his
bedroom Caitlin comes in and dives
all over me

RANDAL
Thats cheating

DANTE
In the middle of it she calls me
Brad

RANDAL
She called you Brad

DANTE
She called me Brad

RANDAL
Thats not cheating People say
crazy shit during sex One time I
called this girl Mom

DANTE
I hit the lights and she freaks
Turns out she thought I was Brad
Michaelson

RANDAL
What do you mean

DANTE
She was supposed to meet Brad
Michaelson in a bedroom She picked

the wrong one She had no idea I
was even at the party

RANDAL
Oh my God

DANTE
Great story isnt it

RANDAL
That girl was vile to you

DANTE
Interesting postscript to that
story Do you know who wound up
going with Brad Michaelson in the
other dark bedroom

RANDAL
Your mother

DANTE

DANTE

the world

RANDAL
n light of this lurid tale I
dont see how you could even
romanticize your relationship with
Caitlin-she broke your heart and
inadvertently drove men to deviant
lifestyles

DANTE
Because there was a lot of good in
our relationship
RANDAL
Oh yeah

DANTE
Im serious Aside from the
cheating we were a great couple
Thats what high schools all
about-algebra bad lunch and
infidelity

RANDAL
You think things would be any
different now

DANTE
They are When she calls me now
shes a different person-shes
frightened and vulnerable Shes
about to finish college and enter
the real world Thats got to be
scary for anyone

RANDAL
(suddenly recalling)
Oh shit Ive got to place an order

DANTE
Im talking to myself here

RANDAL
No no Im listening Shes
leaving college and

DANTE
and shes looking to me for
support And I think that this is
leading our relationship to a new
level

RANDAL
What about Veronica

DANTE
I think the arguments Veronica and
I are having are some kind of
manifestation of a subconscious
desire to break away from her so
that I can pursue the possibility

of a more meaningful relationship
with Caitlin

RANDAL
Caitlins on the same wave-length

DANTE
I think its safe to say yes

RANDAL
Then I think all four of you had
better sit down and talk it over

DANTE throws the canister

DANTE
Didnt you hear me Caitlin really
is getting married

RANDAL
Which did you like better Jedi or
The Empire Strikes Back

DANTE
(exasperated)
Empire
RANDAL
Blasphemy
DANTE

Empire had the better ending Luke
gets his hand cut off and finds
out Vaders his father Han gets
frozen and taken away by Boba Fett
It ends on such a down note And
thats life-a series of down
endings All Jedi had was a bunch
of Muppets

RANDAL
There was something else going on
in Jedi I never noticed it until

today

follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store
DANTE

Whats that
RANDAL

All right Vaders boss

DANTE
The Emperor

RANDAL
Right the Emperor Now the Emperor
is kind of a spiritual figure yes

DANTE
How do you mean

RANDAL
Well hes like the pope for the
dark side of the Force Hes a holy
man a Shaman kind of albeit an
evil one

DANTE
I guess

RANDAL
Now hes in charge of the Empire
The Imperial government is under
his control And the entire galaxy
is under Imperial rule

DANTE
Yeah

RANDAL
Then wouldnt that logically mean
that its a theocracy If the head
of the Empire is a priest of some
sort then it stands to reason that
the government is therefore one
based on religion

DANTE
It would stand to reason yes

RANDAL
Hence the Empire was a fascist
theocracy and the rebel forces
were therefore battling religious
persecution

DANTE
More or less

RANDAL
The only problem is that at no
point in the series did I ever hear
Leia or any of the rebels declare a
particular religious belief

DANTE
I think they were Catholics

A BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Are you open

DANTE
Yeah Come in

He goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe

RANDAL
You know what else I noticed in Jedi

DANTE
Theres more

RANDAL
So they build another Death Star
right

DANTE
Yeah

RANDAL
Now the first one they built was
completed and fully operational
before the Rebels destroyed it

DANTE
Luke blew it up Give credit where
its due

RANDAL

And the second one was still being
built when they blew it up

DANTE
Compliments of Lando Calrissian

RANDAL
Something just never sat right with
me the second time they destroyed
it I could never put my finger on
it-something just wasnt right

DANTE
And you figured it out

RANDAL
Well the thing is the first Death
Star was manned by the Imperial

army-storm troopers dignitaries-
the only people onboard were
Imperials

DANTE
Basically

RANDAL
So when they blew it up no prob
Evil is punished

DANTE
And the second time around

RANDAL
The second time around it wasnt
even finished yet They were still
under construction

DANTE
So

RANDAL
A construction job of that magnitude
would require a helluva lot more
manpower than the Imperial army had
to offer Ill bet there were
independent contractors working on
that thing plumbers aluminum
siders roofers

DANTE
Not just Imperials is what youre
getting at

RANDAL
Exactly In order to get it built
quickly and quietly theyd hire
anybody who could do the job Do
you think the average storm trooper
knows how to install a toilet main
All they know is killing and white
uniforms

DANTE
All right so even if independent
contractors are working on the
Death Star why are you uneasy with
its destruction

RANDAL
All those innocent contractors
hired to do a job were killed-
casualties of a war they had
nothing to do with

(notices Dantes confusion)

All right look-youre a roofer
and some juicy government contract
comes your way you got the wife
and kids and the two-story in
suburbia-this is a government
contract which means all sorts of
benefits All of a sudden these
left-wing militants blast you with
lasers and wipe out everyone within
a three-mile radius

RANDAL (CONTD)
You didnt ask for that You have
no personal politics Youre just
trying to scrape out a living

The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Excuse me I dont mean to
interrupt but what were you
talking about

RANDAL
The ending of Return of the Jedi

DANTE
My friend is trying to convince me
that any contractors working on the
uncompleted Death Star were innocent
victims when the space station was
destroyed by the rebels

BLUE-COLLAR MAN

Well Im a contractor myself Im
a roofer

(digs into pocket and

produces business card)
Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements
And speaking as a roofer I can say
that a roofers personal politics
come heavily into play when choosing
jobs

RANDAL
Like when

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Three months ago I was offered a
job up in the hills A beautiful
house with tons of property It was
a simple reshingling job but I was
told that if it was finished within
a day my price would be doubled
Then I realized whose house it was

DANTE
Whose house was it

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Dominick Bambinos

RANDAL
Babyface Bambino The gangster

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
The same The money was right but
the risk was too big I knew who he
was and based on that I passed
the job on to a friend of mine

DANTE
Based on personal politics

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Right And that week the Foresci
family put a hit on Babyfaces
house My friend was shot and
killed He wasnt even finished
shingling

RANDAL
No way

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
(paying for coffee)
Im alive because I knew there were
risks involved taking on that
particular client My friend wasnt
so lucky

(pauses to reflect)
You know any contractor willing to
work on that Death Star knew the
risks If they were killed it was
their own fault A roofer listens
to this
(taps his heart)
not his wallet

respectfully quiet for a moment An angry WOMAN opens the
door and pokes her head in

two rental choices she holds She looks from one movie to
the other repeatedly

They say so much but they never
tell you if its any good

RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper The
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was
even heard She tries again but this time with a different
approach

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
Are either of these any good

RANDAL continues to read The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries
harder then louder and more direct

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

Are either of these any good

RANDAL as always reads on

RANDAL

I dont watch movies

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted but not put
off

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
Well have you heard anything about
either of them

RANDAL does his level best to not get involved

RANDAL

No

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

Youve never heard anybody say
anything about either movie

RANDAL (0C)
I find its best to stay out of
other peoples affairs

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

(with a new determination)

Well how about these two movies
(holds up the same two)

RANDAL continues to read his paper not looking up

RANDAL
They suck

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his
paper She has caught him
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
I just held up the same two movies
Youre not even paying attention

RANDAL
No I wasnt

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
I dont think your manager would
appreciate

RANDAL

I dont appreciate your ruse maam

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
I beg your pardon

RANDAL

trick me

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

I only pointed out that you werent
paying any attention to what I was
saying

RANDAL

I hope it feels good

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
You hope what feels good

RANDAL
I hope it feels so good to be right
There is nothing more exhilarating
than pointing out the shortcomings
of others is there

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter
disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video
clerk The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total
disinterest of the news-hungry RANDAL The INDECISIVE
CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies
back onto the wall
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(in a huff)
Well this is the last time I ever
rent here

RANDAL
Youll be missed

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

Screw you

She storms out RANDAL is offended He hops over the counter
and whips the door open

RANDAL closes the door and stands there momentarily
totally appalled by her exiting remark then shakes his head

Shes in here

An ODD MAN sits on the floor surrounded by cartons of eggs
all opened He grabs a carton from the cooler case pops it
open and examines each egg carefully

DANTE (0C)
This has been going on for twenty
minutes

RANDAL and DANTE study the 0C oddity

RANDAL
Whats he looking for

DANTE
He said he has to find a perfect
dozen

RANDAL

Perfect dozen

DANTE
Each egg has to be perfect

RANDAL
The quest isnt going well

DANTE
Obviously not Look at all the
cartons that didnt make the grade

The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from
several different angles

RANDAL (0C)
Why doesnt he just mix and match

DANTE
I told him that and he yelled at me

RANDAL snickers at his friend

RANDAL
What did he say

DANTE
He said it was important to have
standards He said nobody has pride

anymore

RANDAL
Its not like you laid the eggs
yourself

Ill give him five more minutes
then Im calling the cops I dont
need this man Im not even
supposed to be here today

looks at RANDAL

RANDAL
(still staring at the
ODD MAN)
Im as puzzled as you

SMOKER
(paying DANTE)
Ive actually seen it before

DANTE
You know him

SMOKER
No Ive seen that behavior before
Looking for the perfect carton of
eggs right

RANDAL

(a bit astonished)
Yeah Howd you know

SMOKER
Ill bet you a million bucks that
the guys a guidance counselor

DANTE
Why do you say that

SMOKER
I was in the Food City last year
when the same thing happened
different guy though Stock boy
told me that the guy had been
looking through the eggs for like
half an hour doing all sorts of
endurance tests and shit I ask the
kid how come nobody called the
manager and he says it happens
twice a week sometimes more

RANDAL
Get out of here

SMOKER
I kid you not They call it Shell
Shock Only happens with guidance
counselors for some reason The kid
said they used to make a big deal
about it but theres no point

The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor
He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg
still sitting on the floor

SMOKER (0C)
He said they always pay for whatever
they break and they never bother
anybody

DANTE RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the OC man

DANTE
Why guidance counselors

SMOKER
If your job served as little
purpose as theirs wouldnt you
lose it too

RANDAL
Come to think of it my guidance
counselor was kind of worthless

practically everybody shoots a load
against the window and I dont

leaves streaks if you dont clean

The sign on the door reads
TEMPORARILY CLOSED BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD

The PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door one by one
ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around More
players join them

From across the street we get the full odd perspective a
store with many men gliding around on the roof

On the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player
REDDING stretches leaning against the sign RANDAL pulls
his mask on and slaps his glove urging a shot SANFORD
skates in and takes a shot which RANDAL blocks JAY and

and JAY throws up a dime bag DANTE holds a ball in the
center of the court

Ready

PLAYERS take positions SANFORD comes to the center and
holds the ball in drop position DANTE and REDDING face off
and the ball is in play

The game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet
Faces are smashed with sticks slide tackles are made shots
are taken CUs of various players included
INACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the
sidelines More game playing including both goalies getting
scored on and more face-offs

Below a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door He
reads the sign and then backs up into the street attempting
to peer over the ledge Above the game continues

Below the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other
impatiently He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends

Above from over the ledge of the roof we see the head of
the customer peek Skating feet pass rapidly before him and
he watches for a moment before calling out

CUSTOMER
Whens this period over

to the sidelines

DANTE AND RANDAL

(simultaneously)
YES

The CUSTOMER comes to the counter

CUSTOMER
Pack of cigarettes
(pets cat)
Cute cat Whats its name

RANDAL
Annoying Customer

The CUSTOMER lets it sink in and then leaves in a huff
DANTE puts up cigarettes

DANTE
Can you imagine being halfway
decent to the customers at least
some of the time

RANDAL
Let me borrow your car

DANTE
(calmer)
May I be blunt with you

RANDAL
If you must

DANTE
We are employees of Quick Stop
Convenience and RST video
respectively As such we have
certain responsibilities which-
though it may seem cruel and
unusual-does include manning our
posts until closing

RANDAL
I see So playing hockey and
attending wakes-these practices are
standard operating procedure

DANTE
Theres a difference Those were
obligations Obligations that could
not have been met at any later date
Now renting videos-thats just
gratuitous not to mention
illogical considering you work in
a video store

Another CUSTOMER leans in

CUSTOMER
Are you open

DANTE
(rolls his eyes)
Yes

RANDAL
You know what I dont think I care
for you rationale

DANTE
Its going to have to do for now
considering that its my car thats
up for request
(to CUSTOMER)
Can I help you

CUSTOMER
Pack of cigarettes

RANDAL
Whats your point

DANTE
My point is that youre a clerk
paid to do a job You cant just do
anything you want while youre
working

CUSTOMER

(reading tabloid)
Space Alien Revealed as Head of
Time Warner Reports Stock
Increase

(to DANTE and RANDAL)
They print any kind of shit in
these papers

DANTE
They certainly do Two fifty-five

RANDAL
So your argument is that title
dictates behavior

DANTE
What

RANDAL
The reasons you wont let me borrow
your care is because I have a title
and a job description and Im
supposed to follow it right

DANTE
Exactly

CUSTOMER
(interjecting)
I saw one one time that said the
world was ending the next week
(MORE)

CUSTOMER (CONTD)
Then in the next weeks paper they
said we were miraculously saved at
the zero hour by a Koala-fish
mutant bird Crazy shit

RANDAL
(eyes the CUSTOMER annoyed)
So Im no more responsible for my
own decisions while Im here at
work than say the Death Squad
soldiers in Bosnia

DANTE
Thats stretching it Youre not
being asked to slay children or
anything

RANDAL

Not yet
(sips water)

CUSTOMER
(again with the interjections)
And I remember this one time the
damn paper said

RANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer drenching him
The man reacts violently attempting to grab RANDAL from

over the counter RANDAL makes no move but remains untouched
DANTE plays block

CUSTOMER
IM GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD
YOU FUCKING JERKOFF

DANTE
Sir Sir Im sorry He didnt mean
it He was trying to get me

CUSTOMER
Well he missed
DANTE
I know Im sorry Let me refund
your cigarette money and well
call it even

CUSTOMER

(considerably calmer

takes money)
This is the last time I ever come
here

(to RANDAL)
And if I ever see you again Im
gonna break your fucking head open

The CUSTOMER leaves wiping water from his face RANDAL
salutes him

DANTE
(angrily)
What the fuck did you do that for

RANDAL
Two reasons one I hate when the
people cant shut up about the
stupid tabloid headlines

DANTE
Jesus

RANDAL
And two to make a point title
does not dictate behavior

DANTE
What

RANDAL

If title dictated my behavior as a
clerk serving the public I wouldnt
be allowed to spit a mouthful of
water at that guy But I did so my
point is that people dictate their
own behavior Hence even though
Im a clerk in this video store I
choose to go rent videos at Big
Choice

(extends opened palm)
Agreed
DANTE
(shakes his head
hands over keys)
Youre a danger to both the dead
and the living

RANDAL
I like to think Im a master of my
own destiny

DANTE
Please get the hell out of here

RANDAL
I know Im your hero

DANTE
Were you going to tell me or just
send me an invitation

CAITLIN
I was going to tell you But then

didnt want to mess it up

DANTE
You couldve broke it to me gently
you know at least started by
telling me you had a boyfriend I
told you I have a girlfriend

CAITLIN
I know Im sorry But when we
started talkingits like I
forgot I had a boyfriend And then
he proposed last month

DANTE
And you said yes

CAITLIN
Wellkind of sort of

DANTE
Is that what they teach you at that
school of yours Kind of sort of
Everyone knows about this except me
Do you know how humiliating that is

CAITLIN
I wouldve told you and you would
have stopped calling like a baby

DANTE
How do you know that

CAITLIN
Because I know you You prefer
drastic measures to rational ones

DANTE
So youre really getting married

CAITLIN
No

DANTE
No youre not really getting
married

CAITLIN

The story goes like this He
proposed and I told him I had to
think about it and he insisted I
wear the ring anyway Then my
mother told the paper we were
engaged

DANTE
How like her

CAITLIN
Then my mother called me this
morning and told me the announcement
was in the paper Thats when I
hopped the train to come back here
because I knew youd be a wreck

DANTE
Thanks for the vote of confidence
CAITLIN
Was I right

DANTE
Wreck is a harsh term Disturbed is

more like it Mildly disturbed even

CAITLIN
I love a macho facade Its such a
turn-on
(sniffing air)
What smells like shoe polish

DANTE
And you came here to what To
comfort me

CAITLIN
The last thing I needed was for you
to think I was hiding something
from you

DANTE
But you were

CAITLIN
No I wasnt Not really I told
youd Id been seeing other people

DANTE
Yeah but not seriously Christ
youre ready to walk down the
aisle-Id say that constitutes
something more than just seeing
somebody

CAITLIN
Im giving him his ring back

DANTE
What

CAITLIN
I dont want to marry him I dont
want to get married now Im on the
verge of graduation I want to go
to grad school after this And then
I want to start a career I dont
want to be a wife first and then

have to worry about when I going
to fit in all of the other stuff
Ive come way too far and studied
too hard to let my education go to
waste as a housewife And I know
thats what Id become Sangs
already signed with a major firm
and hes going to be pulling a huge
salary which would give me no
reason to work and hes so
traditional anyway

DANTE
Sang His name is a past tense

CAITLIN
Stop it Hes a nice guy

DANTE
If hes so nice why arent you
going to marry him

CAITLIN
I just told you

DANTE
Theres more isnt there

CAITLIN
Why Mr Hicks-whatever do you mean

DANTE
Tell me I dont have something to
do with it

CAITLIN
You dont have anything to do with
it

DANTE
You lie

CAITLIN
Look how full of yourself you are

DANTE
I just believe in giving credit
where credit is due And I believe
that Im the impetus behind your

failure to wed

CAITLIN
If Im so nuts about you then why
am I having sex with an Asian
design major

DANTE
Jesus youre caustic

CAITLIN
I had to bring you down from that
cloud you were floating on When I
say I dont want to get married I
mean just that I dont want to
marry anybody Not for years

DANTE
So whos asking I dont want to
marry you

CAITLIN
Good Stay in that frame of mind

DANTE
Buy can we date

CAITLIN
Im sure Sang and-Veronica-would
like that

DANTE
We could introduce them They might
hit it off

CAITLIN
Youre serious You want to date
again

DANTE
I would like to be your boyfriend

mature youre finishing college
Im already in the job market

CAITLIN
You work in a market all right

DANTE
Cute Tell me you wouldnt want to
go out again After all the talking
weve been doing

CAITLIN
The key word here is talk Dante I
think the idea the conception of
us dating is more idyllic than what
actually happens when we date

DANTE
Sowhat So we should just make
pretend over the phone that were
dating

CAITLIN
I dont know Maybe we should just
see what happens

DANTE
Let me take you out tonight

CAITLIN
You mean on a date

DANTE
Yes A real date Dinner and a movie

CAITLIN
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie

Everything happened at once I
guess I forgot he was back there

Ambulance attendants join them

ATTENDANT 1
Can we take this now

CORONER
Go ahead

The stretcher is wheeled out Midway down the body bag
something protrudes pushing the bag up It is an erection
RANDAL stares at it

DANTE
Was he alive whenCaitlin

CORONER
No I place the time of death at
about three-twenty

RANDAL
Then how could sheyou know

CORONER
The body can maintain an erection
after expiration Sometimes for
hours Did he have the adult
magazine when he came in

DANTE
No I gave it to him

RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief

DANTE
Well he asked me for it

CORONER

(continuing)
I cant say for certain until we
get him back to the lab but my
guess is he was masturbating his
heart seized and he died Thats
when the girl found him

(sniffing the air)
Something smells like shoe polish

RANDAL
(to CORONER)
This has gotta be the weirdest
thing youve ever been called in on

CORONER
(writing)
Actually I once had to tag a kid
that broke his neck trying to put
his mouth on his penis

RANDAL looks down anonymously

DANTE
What about Caitlin

CORONER
Shock trauma Shes going to need
years of therapy after this My
question is How did she come to
have sex with the dead man

DANTE
She thought it was me

The CORONER stares at DANTE

CORONER
What kind of convenience store do
you run here

He exits DANTE and RANDAL stare at the floor

RANDAL
(beat)
Do you think he was talking about
my cousin

oblivious

RANDAL

fuck on the planet the goddam
steel shutters are locked all day

an ex-girlfriend whos catatonic
after fucking a dead guy and my
present girlfriend has sucked

DANTE
I should shit or get off the pot

RANDAL
Yeah you should shit or get off
the pot

DANTE

What are you talking about
RANDAL
Im talking about this thing you
havethis inability to improve
your situation in life

DANTE
Fuck you

RANDAL
Its true Youll sit there and
blame life for dealing a cruddy
hand never once accepting the
responsibility for the way your
situation is

DANTE
What responsibility

RANDAL
All right if you hate this job and
the people and the fact that you
have to come in on your day off
then quit

DANTE
As if its that easy

RANDAL
It is You just up and quit There
are other jobs and they pay better
money Youre bound to be qualified
for at least one of them So whats
stopping you

DANTE
Leave me alone

RANDAL
Youre comfortable This is a life
of convenience for you and any
attempt to change it would shatter
the pathetic microcosm youve
fashioned for yourself

DANTE
Oh like your lifes any better

RANDAL

Im satisfied with my situation for
now You dont hear me bitching
You on the other hand have been
bitching all day

DANTE
Thank you Why dont you go back to
the video store

RANDAL
Its the same thing with Veronica

DANTE
Leave her out of this

RANDAL
You date Veronica because shes low
maintenance and because its
convenient Meanwhile all you ever
do is talk about Caitlin You carry
a torch for a girl you dated in
high school-in high school for
Gods sake Youre twenty-two

DANTE
Leave me alone

RANDAL
If you want Caitlin then face
Veronica tell her and be with
Caitlin If you want Veronica be
with Veronica But dont pine for
one and fuck the other Man if you
werent such a fucking coward

DANTE
If I wasnt such a fucking
coward
(chuckles)
It must be so great to be able to
simplify everything the way you do

RANDAL
Am I right or what

DANTE
Youre wrong Things happened
today okay Things that probably
ruined my chances with Caitlin

RANDAL
What The dead guy Shell get over
fucking the dead guy Shit my
moms been fucking a dead guy for
thirty years I call him Dad

DANTE
Caitlin and I cant be together
Its impossible

RANDAL
Melodrama coming from you seems
about as natural as an oral bowel
movement

DANTE
What do you want me to say Yes I
suppose some of the things youre
saying may be true But thats the
way things are its not going to
change

RANDAL
Make them change

DANTE
I cant all right Jesus would
you leave me alone I cant make
changes like that in my life If I
could I would-but I dont have the
ability to risk comfortable
situations on the big money and the
fabulous prizes

RANDAL
Whore you kidding You can so

DANTE
Jesus H Christ I cant

RANDAL
So youll continue being miserable
all the time just because you
dont have the guts to face change

DANTE
(sadly)
My mother told me once that when I

as three my potty lid was closed
and instead of lifting it I chose
to shit my pants

RANDAL
Lovely story

DANTE
Point is-Im not the kind of person
that disrupts things in order to
shit comfortably

DANTE crosses OC RANDAL appears contemplative

You dont know what you want but
Im not going to sit here anymore
holding your hand until you figure
it out Ive encouraged you to get
out of this fucking dump and go
back to school to take charge of
your life and find direction I
even transferred so maybe you would
be more inclined to go back to
college if I was with you Everyone
said it was a stupid move but I
didnt care because I loved you and
wanted to see you pull yourself out
of this senseless funk youve been
in since that whore dumped you oh
so many years ago And now you want
to go back to her so she can fuck
you over some more

DANTE
I dont want to go back with her

VERONICA

Of course not not now Youre
caught and now youre trying to
snake out of doing what you wanted

just so you can find out what a
fucking idiot you are And when she
dumps you again-and she will
Dante I promise you that-when she
dumps you again I want to laugh at
you right in your face just so
you realize that that was what you
gave up our relationship for

RANDAL
Dante

Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame
DANTE throttles RANDAL choking him to the ground RANDAL
throws his fists into DANTES midriff throwing him back
into the magazine rack RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE
comes at him again RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as
Entenmans products scatter beneath and around him He grabs
a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it using the
opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle DANTE leaps at
his feet and RANDAL grabs the shelves knocking aspirin
over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTES face
DANTE paws at his eyes RANDAL grabs Italian bread and
smacks it into DANTES face as he rushes him blindly DANTE
chases him out of the frame MandMs scatter wildly across the
empty floor and the ruckus is heard 0C

Cut TO
DANTE and RANDAL later out of breath on the floor RANDAL
sits up against the candy rack rubbing his neck DANTE lies
on the floor bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies
ripped-open candies broken bread and other damaged goods

RANDAL
Hows your eye

DANTE
(reluctantly)
The swellings not so bad But the
FDS stings
(then)
Hows your neck

RANDAL
Its hard to swallow

They are both silent Then

RANDAL
You didnt have to choke me

DANTE
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica
that I was going to dump her for
Caitlin

RANDAL
I thought I was doing you a favor

DANTE

RANDAL
You still didnt have to choke me

DANTE

DANTE
Why do I say that Randalforget

RANDAL
No really What did I do that was

DANTE

come to work is to make my life
miserable

RANDAL
How do you figure

DANTE
What time did you get to work today

RANDAL
Like ten after

DANTE
You were over half an hour late

RANDAL
To talk to you

DANTE
Which means the video store is
ostensibly closed

RANDAL
Its not like Im miles away

DANTE

mother while pouring sugar in my
gas tank

DANTE (CONTD)
(sighs)
You know what the real tragedy is
Im not even supposed to be here
today

RANDAL

(suddenly outraged)
Fuck you Fuck you pal Listen to
you trying to pass the buck again
Im the source of all your misery
Who closed the store to play hockey
Who closed the store to attend a
wake Who tried to win back an ex-
girlfriend without even discussing
how he felt with his present one
You wanna blame somebody blame
yourself

(beat as DANTE)
Im not even supposed to be here
today

(whips stuff at DANTE)
You sound like an asshole Whose
choice was it to be here today
Nobody twisted your arm Youre
here today of your own violation
my friend But youd like to
believe that the weight of the
world rests on your shoulders-that
the store would crumble if Dante
wasnt here Well I got news for
you jerk This store would survive
without you Without me either All
you do is overcompensate for having
whats basically a monkeys job

You push fucking buttons Any moron
can waltz in here and do our jobs
but youre obsessed with making it
seem so much more fucking important
so much more epic than it really is
You work in a convenience store
Dante And badly I might add And
I work in a shitty video store
Badly as well

(beat)
You know that guy Jays got it
right-he has no delusions about
what he does Us We like to make
ourselves seem so much better than
the people that come in here just
looking to pick up a paper or-God
forbid-cigarettes We look down on
them as it were so advanced
Well if were so fucking advanced
then what are we doing working here

RANDAL gets up leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong
words alone

the floor and takes the money out of the register He grabs
a paper bag and jams the money in it He grabs handfuls of
change shoves it in his pocket and then quickly exits the
frame DANTE continues to lie on the floor
