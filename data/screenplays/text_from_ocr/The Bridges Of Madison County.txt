FADE IN
EXT JOHNSON FARMHOUSE - DAY

CAROLYN mid-40s is standing in the doorway of the
farmhouse watching a car drive up the road towards her

A LAWYER is unloading a briefcase from the trunk of his
car

As the car approaches Carolyn smiles She steps out of
the doorway and heads for the car out of which exit her
brother MICHAEL and his country girl wife BETTY a stout
buxom chatterbox Both boast Florida tans and fashion
styles

MICHAEL
(to Carolyn)
Explain to me again why we didnt
do this in Des Moines in an air
conditioned office

—— CAROLYN
Moms orders

MICHAEL
Is that the lawyer

CAROLYN
(nods )
I have some sandwich fixings if
youre hungry

BETTY

(proudly )
No we just had lunch at the hotel
with my brother and his new wife
She told me all the dirt I
forgot how interesting things can
get around here It was so good
to see them The last time we
visited they were in Europe He
is doing so well He ordered
champagne For lunch I nearly
died

MICHAEL
I nearly died when I had to pick
up the check

BETTY
Michael doesn’t understand
People who make the kind of money
my brother makes don’t carry money
on them They keep it all in
various accounts

MICHAEL
Then we should have had lunch at
the bank

Carolyn tries not to laugh Betty shoots him a dirty
look then stops take in the house and its surroundings

BETTY
Boy It sure has been a long
time

MICHAEL

(correcting her)
We were here two Christmases ago

BETTY
Well thats a long time

MICHAEL
Its not ‘that long

BETTY

(suddenly upset )
Well why dont I just say black so
you can say white

(to Carolyn)
Dont be surprised to find your
brother hasnt changed an iota
He hardly ever talks and when he
does its in that tone You
should have heard him at lunch --
not two words until the bill came
and then he says ‘Worth every
penny

MICHAEL
(defensive)

g
io

BETTY

(angry)
You said it in that tone Like
you were angry at me at my
brother at the world for forcing
you to eat a nice lunch

MICHAEL
Oh Jesus

BETTY
(starting to cry)
I simply cannot stand that tone

CAROLYN
(sympathetically)
Come inside Youre just tired
from the trip

She comforts Betty who indulges in the attention

BETTY
Iam so sick and tired of
apologizing and not knowing what
Ive done

CAROLYN
Im sure you havent done
anything Have some iced tea
How are the kids

MICHAEL
We dropped them off with Bettys
mom Wheres Steve

CAROLYN
(uncomfortably )
Hes not coming

Betty suddenly stops crying and abrasively focuses on
Carolyns problems

BETTY
Aw is he still cheating on you
hon

Carolyn suddenly loses sympathy for her
CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Lawyer hands Michael a document

LAWYER

the contents from the safe deposit
box

( )
BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY - Rev 101294 4

LAWYER (CONTD)
(as Michael does)
And this one which clears the
bank of all further responsibility
for the contents

Betty whispers to Carolyn

BETTY
This is kind of exciting You
think well find out your mother
had secret millions lying around

Carolyn smiles weakly Michael hands back the papers

LAWYER
All right Why dont we begin

He takes out Francescas Last Will and Testament

LAWYER
Your mother has been interred at
Cedar Heights Funeral Home until
arrangements can be made

- MICHAEL
(to Carolyn)
I thought everything was arranged

CAROLYN
Well theres a problem

MICHAEL
What problem

LAWYER
Your mother left explicit
instructions that she wished to be

cremated

MICHAEL
Cremated

BETTY
Eeeww

CAROLYN
I know I dont understand it
either

MICHAEL

When did she decide this
( )
BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY - Rev 101294

LAWYER
(reading will)
Apparently just before her death

MICHAEL
Well thats crazy I dont know
anybody who gets cremated

BETTY
Lots of people do

MICHAEL
Well no one in my family did Dad
bought cemetery plots at Prairie
Hills One for him one for Mom

LAWYER
It clearly states in the will --

MICHAEL
I dont care what it says Maybe
Mom was delirious you know She
didnt know what she was saying
If she wanted to be cremated why
the hell did she let Dad buy two
plots huh

LAWYER
Well she was very specific She
wanted her ashes to be thrown off
Roseman Bridge

MICHAEL
What
BETTY
How bizarre
CAROLYN

Mr Peterson are you sure Mom
wrote all this

LAWYER
Well it was notarized and
witnessed by a Mrs Lucy Delaney
Maybe you can ask her

MICHAEL
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney

CAROLYN
I remember a Mrs Delaney but Mom
told me years ago she died

( )

eo
2A 2

MICHAEL
Well I dont care if its legal or
not were not cremating her and
throwing her off some bridge where
we cant even go visit her because
shes going to be blown all over
the place like an ashtray

BETTY
Not to mention people driving over
her and doggies doing their
business -- -

MICHAEL
(interrupting)
Were not doing it Im not even
sure its Christian

BETTY
Maybe it’s an Italian thing
(to Lawyer)
Their mother was Italian

MICHAEL
Doesnt matter Move on

The women dare not object The lawyer raises his
eyebrows and continues

LAWYER
Well well come back to that
Shall we open the box

JUMP CUT TO

SAME SCENE - CLOSE ON SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX - MOMENTS 2A
LATER

A key is inserted and the lid is opened There are many
papers deeds etc Michael begins sorting through these

Carolyn notices a manila envelope addressed to her mother
postmarked 1965 She ovens it up to find two letters and
a photograph -- Francesca standing near a covered bridge
her hair wind-blown her expression serene beautiful and
sad

CAROLYN
Michael look -- Ive never seen
this picture of Mom have you

”

Betty and Michael look over her shoulder He shakes no

( )
2A

2A

CAROLYN
It was in this envelope from 1965

BETTY
Shes not wearing a bra
(takes bridge photo)
This is Holliwell Bridge in case
anyones interested

Interested yes but no one thinks anything of it
Michael returns to the other papers Betty takes the
photograph for further examination Carolyn opens one
of the letters and begins to read

The following dialogue is heard 0S as CAMERA ANGLES
ON Carolyn reading one of the letters

BETTY (0S)
Its a beautiful picture of her

MICHAEL (0S)
(to Lawyer)
Why are there two deeds here

LAWYER (0S)
One is for the original parcel
your father bought and this one is
for the additional acres he
purchased in 59

MICHAEL (0S)
And this

LAWYER (05S)
Those are bills of sale from the
equipment your mother sold in

‘Their conversation continues 08 Throughout their

conversation we FOCUS ON Carolyn as she reads and
her expression sinks into one of shock and confusion
She flips to the last page of the letter to read who
it is from She cant believe her eyes

BETTY (0S)
Whats that

Carolyn jumps a little so engrossed in her discovery
She lies

CAROLYN
Oh just an old letter from a
friend

( )
2A ZA

BETTY
(laughs )
No treasure maps huh

CAROLYN
(laughs nervously)
No

Betty starts inspecting knick-knacks around the house she
might be able to take Carolyn looks to Michael

CAROLYN
Michael
MICHAEL
(reading documents)
Yeah
CAROLYN
Michael
MICHAEL
(irritated)
What
CAROLYN

Come here a minute

Michael crosses impatiently to Carolyn Carolyn looks
around to the others then guides him 0S into the
kitchen for privacy He protests

MICHAEL
What Where are we going

They exit Alone with the impatient Lawyer Betty
examines a vase as she pumps him for info

BETTY
Did she say anything in there
about me Leaving me anything in
particular

LAWYER
No

Betty prattles on-as she examines each item much to the
Lawyers dismay hiding her resentment and hurt

( )
2A

BETTY
I didnt expect so She never
liked me Its okay I alway
knew Thought we married too
young Nobody broke his arm -

thats what I said but you know

mothers and sons Also she

never liked the fact of us moving

s

to Florida although thats where

the opportunities were Couldnt

deny that Suppose we should have

visited more but you know she

hardly ever made an effort to come

to Tampa Not even to see her
grandchildren She was a cold

woman They say Italians are hot

blooded but not her She was
cool as ice
-(picks up a
candlestick)
She leave these to anyone

Michael and Carolyn reenter the living room Michaels
expression now matches Carolyn in disbelief

Grateful

BETTY
Whats going on
MICHAEL
Um we were just wondering how

it might be better if Carolyn and

I went over the stuff by
ourselves Not keep you two
waiting around I11 contact
office about the legal work

the Lawyer packs up to leave

BETTY
I dont mind waiting

MICHAEL
Well theres a lot of boring
stuff to do Lists of people

BETTY
Well I can help

MICHAEL
I said no

aggressively Betty is hurt

MICHAEL

Why dont you go to your mothers
Or back to the hotel Sit in some
air conditioning Take a bath

BETTY

(near tears)

I do not

need instructions from

you to bathe
(gets her bag)
I knew youd do this I knew Id

come all

the way here and be shut

out as usual I came to be here

for you

I didnt have to come

(genuinely hurt)
Lord knows I was never much
welcome in this house before
Apparently dead-or alive
nothings changed

CAROLYN

Aw Betty

Carolyn feels badly for her An impatient Michael

refuses sympathy

Embarrassed Betty starts to exit

then stops at the mantle

BETTY
Carolyn -- you want these
candlesticks

CAROLYN

No Id

like you to have them

Betty grabs them both and exits Carolyn looks at

him disapprovingly
hands

Now what

Michael takes the letter from her

MICHAEL
s this about

CUT TO

INT KITCHEN - LATER

2A

Sitting at the kitchen table Carolyn is in the middle of

reading the letter

to Michael
( )

CAROLYN
going over and over in my
mind every detail every moment of
our time together and I ask
myself What happened to me in
Madison County I struggle to put
it together in a way that allows
me to continue knowing were on
separate roads But then I look
through the lens of my camera and
youre there I start to write an
article and I find myself writing
it to you Its clear to me now we
have been moving towards each other
towards those four days all our
lives --

MICHAEL
(rises)
I don’t want to hear anymore
Burn the damn thing I dont want
to hear it Throw it away

Carolyn continues reading silently Michaels curiosity
gets the best of him

MICHAEL
Whats he saying now

CAROLYN
Well he just goes on about how if
Mom ever needed him she could
find him through the National
Geographic Magazine in Washington
DC He was a photographer He
promises not to write again Then
all it says is

(beat )

I love you Robert

MICHAEL
Robert Jesus I11 kill him

CAROLYN

That would be some trick Hes
already dead Thats what this
other letter is

(takes letter and

skims )
From his attorney He left most
of his things to Mom and
requested

She stops

( )

MICHAEL
What

CAROLYN
That he be cremated and his ashes
thrown off Roseman Bridge

MICHAEL
a im I knew Mom wouldnt
have thought of that herself It
was some damn perverted
photographic mind influencing her
When did the bastard die

CAROLYN
82

MICHAEL
Wait a minute That was three
years after Daddy Do you
think

CAROLYN
I dont know Im completely in
the dark here Thats what I get
for moving away

MICHAEL
This happened way before we both
got married I I cant

believe it
(then innocently)
You think she had sex with him

Carolyn cannot believe he is this dense

CAROLYN
(sarcastic)
My Lord It must feel real nice
living inside your head with
Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny

MICHAEL
Dont talk to me like that She
was my mother for Christs sake
And now I find out she was She
was a --

CAROLYN
Dont say that

MICHAEL
Well what am I supposed to think

( )
3A 3

CAROLYN
I cant believe she never told
me We spoke at least once a
week How could she do that

MICHAEL
How did she meet him Did Dad
know Anything else in that
envelope

CAROLYN
No I dont think so I --

She dumps it over and a small key falls out Pause as
Carolyn and Michael look to each other -- they grab the
key and run out of the kitchen almost comically falling
over each other in their obsession to put this puzzle
together

SERIES OF JUMP CUTS 3A
FROM one lock TO another as they try to find the keyhole
that fits the key -- they try closets attic doors

jewelry boxes night tables vanity drawers Finally --
INT BEDROOM - DAY 4

At the foot of their parents’ bed sits a walnut hope
chest covered with a tapestry Michael and Carolyn
look to each other first before one removes the
tapestry and the other tries the key It fits They
open the chest to find

Camera equipment a chain with a medallion that reads
FRANCESCA three leather bound notebooks -- and a
sealed envelope with Carolyn or Michael written on it

CAROLYN MICHAEL
You read it

Carolyn relents She takes out the letter and reads

CAROLYN
‘January 1987 Dear Carolyn I
hope youre reading this with
Michael Im sure he wouldnt be
able to read it by himself and
hell need some help understanding
all this

( )

Insulted Michael pulls the letter out of her hand and
defiantly attempts to read it aloud himself to disprove
his mothers claim But after looking at a few lines
he surrenders and hands the letter back to his sister

CAROLYN
First and most of all I love
you both very much and although I
feel fine I thought it was time
to put my affairs excuse that
word in order

MICHAEL
I cant believe shes making
jokes

CAROLYN

Sshhh ‘After going through the
safety deposit box Im sure
youll find your way to this
letter Its hard to write this
te my own children I could let
this die with the rest of me I
suppose But as one gets older
ones fears subside What
becomes more and more important
is to be known -- known for all
-that you were during this brief
stay How sad it seems to me

to leave this Earth without those
you love the most ever really
knowing who you were Its easy
for a mother to love her children
no matter what - its something
that just happens I dont know
if its as simple for children
Youre all so busy being angry

at us for raising you wrong But
I thought it was important to give
you that chance To give you the
opportunity to love me for all
that I was

Carolyn and Michael lock to each other like two school
children about to take a difficult exam They continue

CAROLYN
His name was Robert Kincaid He
was a photographer and he was here
in 1965 shooting an article for
National Geographic on the covered
bridges of Madison County

(MORE )

( )

CAROLYN (CONTD)
Remember when we got that issue
How we felt like celebrities
Remember when we started getting
the subscription

They dont remember

CAROLYN
I dont want you to be angry
with him I hope after you
know the whole story you might
even think well of him Even

grateful

MICHAEL
Grateful

CAROLYN

(reads)
Its all there in the three
notebooks Read them in order
If you don’t want to I suppose
thats okay too But in that
case I want you to know something
-- I never stopped loving your
father He was a very good man
Its just that my love for Robert
was different He brought out
something in me no one had ever
brought out before or since He
mademe féel like a woman in a
way few women ever experience

MICHAEL
(cuts her off)
Thats it

Grabbing the letter he starts putting everything back
in the trunk

CAROLYN
What are you doing

MICHAEL
This is crazy She waits ‘til
shes dead to tell us all this
Well I got news for you She
was my mother Thats enough for
me I dont have to know who she
was

CAROLYN
Well Id like to read them

MICHAEL
No Were going to lock this up
and --
CAROLYN

(as Michael

freezes)
I want to read them If you dont
want to then just leave But
dont you push me around like Im
some mule you paid for -- I
already have usband

Michael is stymied

INT KITCHEN - LATER

Carolyn opens the first notebook which is dated AUGUST
1965 Michael sits beside her with a cup of coffee -

- CAROLYN

(reading)
It was the week of the Illinois
State Fair The two of you were
going with Dad to exhibit
Carolyns prize steer’

Carolyns voice becomes Francesca’s voice as we --

DISSOLVE TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - EVENING

FRANCESCA is making dinner A BLUES station is tuned in
on the RADIO

FRANCESCA (V0)
I know it sounds awful but I
couldnt wait for you all to
leave You were going to be
gone until Friday Four days
(beat )
Just four days

Francescas expression looks as if she needs a break
from her family for more like four years

FRANCESCA
Michael Carolyn Richard
Dinner

She sets down a bowl of potatoes a plate of sausages
coffee and corn as one by one her family enters and sits
down

Michael enters through a screen door from the back
letting the door slam shut

FRANCESCA
Michael what did I tell you
about that door

Richard enters after Michael letting the door slam the
same way Francesca is about to say something but gives

up

Carolyn enters and crosses to the kitchen RADIO Leaning
on the counter she turns the dial to a COUNTRY station
This clearly irritates Francesca but she knows there is
no point in arguing

Everyone sits and begins eating -- in complete silence
except for the song

When Michael cant open the ketchup bottle Francesca
grabs it palms the top skillfully and twists it off
She hands it back to Michael who makes no comment

When Richard scans the table for something that obviously
isnt there Francesca is up out of her seat before he
can ask at the fridge grabbing the sour cream closing
the fridge and back at the table with incredible
swiftness

When Michael moves his big arm to reach for the salt he
knocks over his cup and saucer which Francesca catches
with both hands before they hit the floor Her reflexes
are like a trained athlete

Finally Francesca is able to sit and sip her coffee
She watches her teenage daughter fill her plate with a
blank expression that lets nothing slip through -- no
indication of all the tempests of emotions that go
through a teenage girl

FRANCESCA
You excited about going Carolyn

Without looking up Carolyn fakes a smile Francesca

then looks to her son shoveling food into his mouth at
an alarming rate She attempts a conversation

FRANCESCA
How was your date last night

MICHAEL
(without looking
at her)
Okay

FRANCESCA
Whats her name

MICHAEL
Betty

FRANCESCA
Whats she like

MICHAEL
Okay

Silence Frustrated Francesca looks at Michael with
dismay

CUT TO

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Francesca is packing Richards suitcase Richard is at
his bureau He is trying to open a drawer but its
stuck

RICHARD
Damn drawer

Francesca crosses to him and ushers him aside Holds
onto the drawer nobs she looks at Richard pauses then
does a funny jolt with her body that makes the drawer
slip out easily

FRANCESCA
You cant get mad at it

RICHARD
(to bureau joking)
Im sorry I shouldnt have
yelled May I get a handkerchief
please

Francesca chuckles as she closes up the suitcase
Richard takes out a handkerchief from the drawer and
closes it

FRANCESCA
You should stay away from anything
too spicy

( )

Words are no longer required They read each others
minds

FRANCESCA
And I want you to promise me

RICHARD
I swear Only filters and no more
than half a pack a day I got my
orders

FRANCESCA
(defensive)
Doc Reynolds said youd be a lot
better off --

RICHARD
I know I know Im kidding You
sure you dont want to come

Francesca looks at Richard with complete conviction

FRANCESCA
Im positive -

RICHARD
What are you going to do for four
days as a woman of leisure

FRANCESCA
Same thing I do as a hired hand
only with less help

Francesca realizes this has hurt Richards feelings
She smiles

RICHARD
I wont be able-to sleep ya know
Cant sleep without you next to me
anymore

FRANCESCA
Its only four days

He gives her a sweet peck on the lips Francesca touches
his face gently

CUT TO

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Francesca waves as her family drives down the driveway
in their truck kicking up a cloud of dust

(
9A

When the dust fades the truck is gone out the driveway
and on the road

Francesca turns and heads back to the house As it
slowly comes into view from atop the corn husks she
stops She knows the house is empty now She feels
both relief and uncertainty

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Alone dressed in her bathrobe Francesca checks the

front door She crosses to the living room Noticing
two throw pillows on the floor she arranges them neatly
on the couch She sits herself in an easy chair then
flicks on a reading lamp and opens her book After five
seconds she closes the book She crosses to the TV

and turns it ON then turns it OFF before the picture
tuned in

She turns and leans on the TV flicking the ONOFF
switch ON and OFF as her mind wanders She gets an idea
She crosses to the hi-fi and looks through several albums
she got from her Columbia Record Club But nothing
inspires her and she quickly loses the desire for music
Shes antsy She has this time alone and she doesnt
know how to spend it

She walks through the dining room passing a china closet
filled with fancy dishes and glasses She stops Shoved
in the corner behind is an old unopened bottle of
brandy She removes it setting atop the dining table

to open it then quickly changes her mind and returns

the brandy to its lonely spot on the shelf

CuT TO

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She walks into the kitchen and leans on the counter to
turn ON the RADIO She stands just like her daughter as
she tunes in the BLUES station

She sits at the Formica table with a glass of milk and
listens A DOG SCRATCHES at the screen door Francesca
rises to let him in

FRANCESCA
Whereve you been They already
left ya know -- you missed them

( )
9A

9A

He sits by her chair at the table She sits down He
leans into her She scratches his head

FRANCESCA
I dont know why youre so sweet
onmme -- you know I dont like
you

Of course she does like him shes just in a teasing
mood The MUSIC PLAYS Francesca softens as she pets
him

FRANCESCA
You like this song

’ CUT TO

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY 10

Francesca wearing a simple house dress has two rugs
hung over the porch She is beating them to get the dust
out It is a hot day She stops to wipe her brow She-
grabs a glass of iced tea from off the porch takes a

sip then presses the glass against her chest Francesca
looks up to the sun to clear her mind It is blinding

When she looks back out onto her driveway her vision is
momentarily blurred Until slowly out of the blur
she sees

A truck driving toward her house kicking up dust like
some phantom appearing through the etheric plane She
sips her cool drink and blinks to regain her vision The
truck comes down her driveway and stops halfway

Francesca watches with suspicious curiosity as

The truck stops and ROBERT KINCAID steps out Flashing
his blue eyes in her direction he smiles and says

ROBERT
Sorry to bother you but Ive got
a feeling Im lost

Francesca remains guarded

FRANCESCA
Are you supposed to be in Iowa

( )

He laughs

ROBERT
(laughs )
Yeah

FRANCESCA
Well youre not that lost

She puts down her tea and crosses to him

ROBERT
Im looking for a covered bridge
out this way uh wait a
minute --

He looks through a small notepad for the name Francesca
watches him intently

FRANCESCA
Roseman Bridge
ROBERT
Thats it
FRANCESCA

Well youre pretty close Its
only about two miles from here

ROBERT
Oh terrific Which way

FRANCESCA

Go that way and you will come to

Cutters where you turn left

ROBERT
Cutters

FRANCESCA
Cutter’s farm Small house close
to the road Big mean yellow dog

ROBERT
Oh Okay

FRANCESCA
Yes and then you just take that
road until it forks -- I think

‘less than half a mile

ROBERT
Which fork

BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY - Rev 9794 23

FRANCESCA

The right and you go -- no Not
that fork excuse me Then you
pass Petersons -- Petersons
farm and by the old schoolhouse
you go left It would be easier
to tell you if the roads were
marked

ROBERT
Sure would

Pause as Robert awaits directions and Francesca scans a
sudden impulse

FRANCESCA
Well I can take you if you want

Robert is pleased but a bit surprised as is Francesca
who anxiously recants

FRANCESCA
Or I can tell you I can take
you or tell you Its up to
you I dont care Either way

Robert smiles finding her sudden nervousness charming
ROBERT
If Im not taking you away from
anything

24 10

FRANCESCA
No I was just going to have some
iced tea then split the atom
but that can wait
(as he smiles)
I just have to get my shoes

Robert watches her as she turns and heads back to the
house He turns back to the truck and notices the
mailbox -- MR and MRS RICHARD JOHNSON He nods as if
he knew all along and begins to make room on the front
seat for Francesca °

INT JOHNSON HOUSE SAME 11

Francesca is slipping on her shoes when she suddenly
stops What am I doing she asks herself silently

EXT JOHNSON DRIVEWAY - SAME 12

Francesca approaches the truck On the door she reads
KINCAID PHOTOGRAPHY -- BELLINGHAM WASHINGTON

Robert is clearing away paper cups banana peels paper
bags photography equipment In the back Francesca
notices a cooler and a guitar case

ROBERT
I wasnt expecting company Let
me get this out of the way

He hauls a case of film from the front to the back
Francesca notices his tanned muscular arm move in one
graceful sweep

ROBERT
Okay All set

Francesca smiles They both get into the truck

ROBERT
Now where are we going

FRANCESCA
Out then right

CUT TO

EXT MADISON COUNTY ROAD - DAY 13
The truck bounces along on the rock road lime dust
filling the air Kincaid and Francesca ride in silence

The truck passes a small farmhouse and a large angry
yellow DOG races alongside SNARLING and BARKING

Robert looks at Francesca and grins

ROBERT
So far so good This way

FRANCESCA
That way

He follows her directions

ROBERT
There’s a wonderful smell about
Iowa -- very particular to this

part of the country Do you know
what I mean

FRANCESCA
No

ROBERT
I cant describe it I think its
from the loam in the soil This
very rich earthy kind of
alive No No thats not right
Can you smell it

FRANCESCA
(shakes her head)
Maybe its because I live here

ROBERT
That must be it Its a great smell

Francesca wants to know more about him

FRANCESCA
Are you from Washington originally

ROBERT
Uh-huh Lived there til I was
twenty or so and then moved to
Chicago when I got married

FRANCESCA
Oh When did you move back

FRANCESCA
(surprised)

ROBERT
Oh yeah Actually I had an
assignment in Greece and I had to
go through Bari to get the boat
at Brindisi But it looked so
pretty I got off and stayed for a
few days Breathtaking country

is overcome by the idea of such freedom
FRANCESCA
You just got off the train

because it looked pretty

ROBERT
Yeah Excuse me a sec 13

He reaches over with one arm brushing slightly against
her thigh He opens the glove compartment and pulls out
a pack of Camels and a Zippo lighter

ROBERT
Like one

Francesca hesitates

FRANCESCA
Sure Ill have one

She takes a cigarette out of the pack Robert drops the
pack and with the same hand flicks open the Zippo and

ignites it Francesca leans over The road is bumpy and
a breeze blows through both windows

She cups her hands around his to shelter the flame She
feels his skin for a brief moment

She sits back and enjoys the ride and her cigarette as
Robert lights up Silence They drive

ROBERT
So how long youve been living
here

FRANCESCA
Long

(changes subject)
You just got off the train and
stayed without knowing anyone

there
ROBERT
(laughs )
Yeah

The truck stops They exit Robert takes out some
equipment

ROBERT

FRANCESCA

( )

14 14

He smiles and takes his equipment to the bridge
Francesca slowly follows She watches his body move
Catching herself she stops

Robert sets up a tripod in the small ravine beneath the
bridge pointing a view finder up as he plans his shots
Francesca walks through the bridge noticing lovers names
scrawled on the inside CATHY and BUDDY 4 EVER ROSIE
AND HANK TIL THE END OF TIME Through a crack in one of
the wooden planks Francesca watches like a voyeur as
Robert works She sees him take out a hankerchief and
wipe the sweat off his neck then inside his shirt and
around his chest Without knowing where Francesca is
Robert speaks aloud

ROBERT
Is it always this hot

Francesca moves quickly away from the plank like a
Peeping Tom who’s been caught

FRANCESCA
This time of year

ROBERT
I have some cold drinks in a
cooler if youd like

FRANCESCA
Oh Would you like one

ROBERT
Not right now thanks

Francesca heads back to the truck grateful for something
to occupy her

Inside the truck she scans for the cooler bag She sees
it next to a duffel bag The bags zipper is opened

She glimpses inside at Roberts personal things --

Stevenson the other a cover photo of the Watts riots The
guitar leans against the cooler She grabs a soda from

out of it

bridge and out the other end She finds Robert bent
over picking flowers

FRANCESCA
There you are

ROBERT
Oh You caught me

He rises with a bouquet of wildflowers for her

ROBERT
Thanks for your help

Francesca smiles not knowing how to take this

’ ROBERT
Men still give women flowers dont
they I mean as a sign of
appreciation Im not that out of
date am I

FRANCESCA
No not at all --
(suddenly)
-- except those are poisonous

ROBERT
What

He flings the flowers down He wipes his hands furiously

FRANCESCA
Im sorry I was kidding

Robert looks at her with a shocked smirk secretly liking
her strange behavior

ROBERT
(smiling)
Are you by nature a sadistic
person
She laughs as she helps him pick them up

tea

ROBERT

Francesca smiles and sips her own She watches him gulp
down the tea so fast some of it dribbles down the ide of
his face and neck Francesca finds it sexy He empties
it
FRANCESCA

Would you like another one

Robert nods and pulls out his cigarettes Robert lights
up as he watches her fix-another iced tea He watches
her slip off one shoe then the other -- never missing a
beat of her preparation He cant help eyeing her body
When she returns she also has the flowers he picked for
her arranged in a jelly glass She places them on the
table and sits

ROBERT
Sure you want to keep those in the
house

FRANCESCA

ROBERT

ROBERT

Everything does One of the laws
of nature People are always so
afraid of change But if you
look at it like its something
you can count on happening its
actually a comfort Not many
things you can count on for sure

FRANCESCA
I guess Except Im one of the
people it frightens

ROBERT
I doubt that

FRANCESCA
Why

ROBERT
Italy to Iowa Id call that a
change 17

FRANCESCA
(explaining)

him while I was living in Naples
I didn’t know where Iowa was I
only cared that it was America
And of course being with Richard

ROBERT

ROBERT

Francesca looks at him She wants to tell the truth but
holds back

FRANCESCA
Its uh uh

She stops Robert smiles

ROBERT
Go ahead I wont tell anyone

Surprised Francesca looks at him oddly -- as if he

already knows and is giving her permission
Francesca is so taken by his understanding and
acceptance she lets the flood gates open speaking
faster than her mind can keep up --

Francesca
the table 17

FRANCESCA
(without a pause)
Im supposed to say ‘Just fine
Its quiet The people are real
nice’ All of thats true
mostly It is quiet And the
people are nice in certain ways
We all help each other out If
someone gets sick or hurt the
neighbors pitch in and pick corn
or harvest oats or do whatever
needs to be done In town you
can leave your car unlocked and
let your children run without
worrying about them There are a
lot of good things about the
people here and I respect them
for those qualities But

hesitates lights a cigarette and looks across
at Kincaid

FRANCESCA
Its not what I dreamed about
as a girl

Kincaid is silent for a moment

ROBERT
I scribbled something in my
notebook the other day for
future use just had the idea
while driving along That happens
a lot It goes like this The
old dreams were good dreams they
didnt work out but Im glad I
had them’ I’m not sure what that
means but Ill use it somewhere
So I think I kind of know how you

feel

Francesca smiles at him For the first time the smile

seems warm and deep She surprises herself She

doesnt want him to go

FRANCESCA
Would you like to stay for dinner

alone So would I

INT BEDROOM 194

Francesca finds herself staring He has a muscular firm
body She watches how the water cascades over his body
How he seems so unashamed so “in his skin moving with
such strength and grace

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE 19B

Robert pauses and looks out over the open pasture The
cold water feels good Since the pump is in the back of
the house hidden from the road no one can see him

INT- BEDROOM 19¢C

Francesca continues studying Robert until she has to
literally pull herself away from the window with such a
force that she rams herself into a chest of drawers
Taking a breath she pulls hurself together

FRANCESCA °
This is ridiculous

She heads for the bathroom quite composed then without
warning makes an immediate 180 degree turn and heads
back to the window to sneak a peek

Watching him she is possessed by some very frightening
feelings and runs from the window into the bathroom
closing the door behind her

END OF MONTAGE

INT KITCHEN - EVENING 22

Robert and Francesca are in the middle of dinner But
instead of the usual silence that surrounds Johnson
family eating Francesca is mesmerized by Robert as he
manages to eat and tell a story The scene begins with
a laugh from Francesca

ROBERT
(laughs )
- No wait it gets better

He stands up and acts it out for her

ROBERT
You have to get the full picture
here I have three cameras around
my neck a tripod in one hand and
my pants down around my ankles
I thought this was a private bush
I look up and this gorilla is
Staring at me with what can best
be described as the most
lascivious expression Ive ever
seen on a body with so much hair

Francesca laughs
ROBERT
I freeze ‘Cause thats what they
tell you to do In this position
It comes towards me and and

He stops awkwardly

FRANCESCA
What

ROBERT
It starts

FRANCESCA
Oh my God

(laughs )

Youre blushing

ROBERT
(mock hurt)
Its still a very sensitive
memory for me

FRANCESCA
Then what happened

ROBERT
We got engaged

She laughs

FRANCESCA
I hope it was a female gorilla

ROBERT
I hope so too We still write

Francesca is laughing so hard she cant breathe Robert
loves making her laugh

FRANCESCA
You ought to write these stories
down

ROBERT

Nah Ive tried My writings
too technical I think Problem of
being a journalist too long is you
stop giving yourself permission to
invent I better just stick to
making pictures

FRANCESCA
Making pictures I like that
You really love what you do dont
you

ROBERT

(nods smiles shyly)
Im kind of obsessed by it
actually

And did you

39 22

FRANCESCA
Why do you think

ROBERT
I dont know if obsessions have
reasons I think thats why theyre
obsessions

FRANCESCA
You sound like an artist

ROBERT
No I wouldnt say that National
Geographic likes their wild life
in focus and without any personal
comment I dont mind really
Im no artist Id faced that a
long time ago It’s the curse of
being well-adjusted Im too
normal

FRANCESCA
(supportively)
I dont think youre normal

He looks at her in surprise She catches herself again

FRANCESCA
I didnt mean that the way it
sounded

ROBERT

Well lets just call it a
compliment and move on

(changes subject)
Did you love teaching

FRANCESCA
Sometimes When there was a
particular student who made a’
difference I know theyre all
supposed to but its not true
You tend to single out one or two
you think you can contribute
something to

ROBERT

FRANCESCA
Id like to think so I know one
of them went on to medical school

ROBERT
Why did you stop 22

Francesca

FRANCESCA
My children And Richard didnt
like my working

ROBERT
Do you miss it

FRANCESCA
I dont know Ive never thought
about it what was the most

exciting place youve ever been
to Unless youre tired of talking
about it

ROBERT
Youre asking a manif hes too
tired to talk about himself You
dont get out much do you

smiles a little embarrassed

ROBERT
Im sorry That was
FRANCESCA

(overlapping)

No Its alright I just meant
it might be a little dull for you
telling all this to some housewife
in the middle of nowhere

ROBERT
This is your home Its not
nowhere And its not dull

Francesca smiles again this time relieved

ROBERT
Lets see -- my favorite place

Francesca settles in to listen never taking her eyes
off of him

ROBERT
Well it’s the obvious choice but
I think Id have to say Africa
Its another world Not just the
people and the cultures but the
land the colors you see at dawns
and dusks -- and the life there
It charges every molecule of air

Francesca is fascinated being drawn into his imagery

( )

ROBERT

Its tangible -- the moment to
moment of life and death the co-
habitation of man and beast of

beast and beast wholl

survive

who wont -- and theres no
judgment about it No right or
wrong or imposed morality Its
just life Its a voyeurs

paradise really because

those

animals dont want anybody in
their business You can watch

but at a distance

Robert smiles at her sensing how in tune she is with

his feelings

FRANCESCA

My God How Id love to see that

ROBERT

They have safaris for tourists
now Maybe you can convince your

husband

Francesca smiles There is an awkward pause between

them
ROBERT
Its a beautiful night
like to go for a walk

FRANCESCA

Would you

Yes That would be nice

He gets up and opens the screen door for Francesca
not letting it slam Francesca looks like a teenager

with first date excitement

EXT PASTURE - NIGHT

CUT TO

Francesca and Robert walk through the pasture It is a

beautiful night

ROBERT
Youve got it all right

as any other place Ive

FRANCESCA
What

ROBERT
(indicating the night)
This ‘The silver apples of the
moon The golden apples of the
sun

Francesca looks at him with surprise

FRANCESCA
WB Yeats ‘The Song of Wandering
Aengus

ROBERT

Right Good stuff Yeats
Realism economy Sensuousness
beauty magic Appeals to my
Irish heritage

She watches him with great appreciation He smiles at
her Instead of looking away their eyes remain locked
for a moment There is clearly an attraction They
simultaneously look away and continue walking

Francescas heart is beating a mile a minute yet she
cant deny she is enjoying herself Walking side by
side in silence Francesca turns back occasionally

to look at her house as they get further away from it
Suddenly the more distant the house becomes the more
frightened she starts to feel Something inside her
knows shes going too far with this man -- too far from
home Although a part of her wants it she is surprised
to find a larger part of her finds it too unknown

She stops

ROBERT
Whats wrong

Francesca looks confused for a moment not knowing what
she wants She cant move She searches for a way out

FRANCESCA
Would you like some coffee Or
maybe some brandy
Somehow Robert can sense her uneasiness He obliges

ROBERT
How about both

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 24

The room is illuminated by a single light over the
kitchen sink Francesca moves about the kitchen
preparing coffee -- dropping the coffee pot basket
spilling the grounds She acts tense Robert sits at
the table opening the brandy bottle Francesca almost
opened the night before aware of her mood There

are two brandy glasses in the cupboard that Robert
takes down

Francesca gets the coffee going then sets the table
with cups and saucers

ROBERT
You sure you wont let me help
you with those dishes

FRANCESCA

(coldly)

No I11 do them later

ROBERT
Francesca

FRANCESCA
What

ROBERT
Are you alright

FRANCESCA
Yes

ROBERT
Francesca

FRANCESCA
What

ROBERT
Were not doing anything wrong
you know

Francesca freezes He has read her mind again

ROBERT
(smiles)
Nothing you can’t tell your
children about

Once again he relieves her of fear and anxiety He hands
her a glass of brandy raises his glass to shoulder level
and moves it toward her

44

24

ROBERT
To ancient evenings and distant
music

Francesca takes a short breath touches her glass to his
and smiles a little

They sit in comfortable silence enjoying their brandy
and coffee smoking a little The soft sounds of a hot
summer night fill the air -- a PHEASANT CALLS from the
fields a DOG BARKS twice in the distance CRICKETS
quietly SERENADE and a moth flutters against the sink
light

MICHAEL

Michael nods then speaks with sincere compassion
MICHAEL

CAROLYN

MICHAEL
Then why do you

Carolyn laughs to herself -- she cant explain it to
herself She looks through the kitchen cabinets and
gasps

CAROLYN
Oh my God I dont believe it

MICHAEL
What

Carolyn pulls out a newly bought jar of Fluffernutter

MICHAEL
Wow I bet its been here since
we were kids You could probably
spackle walls with it

CAROLYN
No look -- the expiration date is
’ this year She must have bought
it recently And its not opened

MICHAEL
She never ate this stuff We used
to have to beg her to buy it for
us remember

Realizing her mother did buy it for them Carolyns eyes
fill up a little her mothers death striking her for the
first time

INT KITCHEN - LATER 26

Over Fluffernutter sandwiches on white bread and coffee

secrets How he lived this life
of his

he do that

27 INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 27
Francesca sips her brandy Robert sits across from her
FRANCESCA

Do you mind if I ask you why
you got divorced

ROBERT
Not at all I wasnt around
much So why did I get married

Well I thought it was a good idea
at the time Have a home base
Roots You can get lost moving
around so much

FRANCESCA
So what happened

ROBERT
I never got lost I was more at
home everywhere than at one place
So I decided to think of myself as
some kind of world citizen

FRANCESCA
You must get lonely at times

ROBERT
Never touch the stuff I’ve got
friends all over the world Good
friends I can see when I want if
I want

FRANCESCA
Woman friends too

ROBERT
Im a loner not a monk

Francesca averts her eyes before continuing her
investigation

( )

FRANCESCA
You really dont need anyone

ROBERT
No I think I need everyone I
love people Iwant to meet them
all

FRANCESCA
Thats the thing about Iowa You
pretty much meet the same ‘kind of
person over and over so when Mrs
Delaneys husband is having an
affair with ‘that Redfield woman
the whole town wakes up

ROBERT
I just think there are too many
out there saying This is mine
or ‘Shes mine’ Too many lines
have been drawn

FRANCESCA
Doesnt it scare you

ROBERT
I dont know whats coming And
I dont mind I embrace mystery

FRANCESCA
Do you ever regret it The
divorce I mean

ROBERT
No

FRANCESCA
Do you ever regret not having a
family

ROBERT
Not everyones supposed to have a
family

FRANCESCA
But -- how can you just live for
what you want What about other
people

ROBERT

I told you I love other people

FRANCESCA
But no one in particular

( )

Francesca

She rises 27
ROBERT
No But I love them just the
same
FRANCESCA

But its not the same

ROBERT
I know its not the same What
youre saying is its not as
good Or its not as normal or
proper

FRANCESCA
No Im just saying --

ROBERT

(interrupting)
Im a little sick of this American
Family Ethic everyone seems to be
hypnotized by in this country I
guess you think Im just some poor
displaced soul doomed to roam the
earth without a self-cleaning oven
and home movies

FRANCESCA

(irritated)
Just because someone chooses to
settle down and have a family
doesnt necessarily mean theyre
hypnotized Just because Ive
never seen a gazelle stampede
doesnt mean Im asleep in the
world

ROBERT
Do you want to leave your husband

is completely stunned and thrown off guard

FRANCESCA
No Of course not

upset Beat Awkward silence Suddenly there

is tension between them

ROBERT
My mistake I apologize

FRANCESCA
What made you ask such a question

( ) 27
ROBERT
I thought thats what we were
doing -- asking questions
FRANCESCA
(defensive)

I thought we were just having a
converstaion You seem to be
reading all this meaning into it
Meanings I must be too simple to
uh interpret or something

ROBERT
I already apologized

Silence Robert remains seated Francesca remains at
the sink

ROBERT
Roseman Bridge at dawn Id better
get going
(rises)
Thank you for dinner

Pause Francesca feels badly

FRANGESCA
Listen Im sorry I --

ROBERT
No no Forgive me I made a
mistake It was an inappropriate
thing to ask

Francesca shrugs it off

FRANCESCA
I feel like somethings been
spoiled now

Robert smiles and crosses to her He takes her hand into
both his hands

ROBERT
Its been a perfect evening Just
the way it is Thank you

Francesca smiles The possibility of a kiss hangs in the
air between them until Robert turns to get his film out of
the fridge As he exits through the screen door he
stops

( ) 27

ROBERT
Thanks for the evening the
supper the walk They were all
nice Youre a good person
‘Francesca Keep the brandy toward
the front of the cupboard maybe
it will work out after awhile

He smiles and exits catching the screen door before it
slams Robert takes a few steps down the porch and turns

ROBERT
One thing though -- dont kid
yourself Francesca Youre
anything but a simple woman

Francesca doesnt move for a moment then crosses to the
door as if to run after him when she is stopped by the
PHONE RINGING She picks it up

liked to be third which is not

too early and not too late But

EXT BACK PORCH - NIGHT 28

Francesca sits on the porch with a book in her lap gazing
out over the pasture Its a hot night She opens the
top of her robe a bit Feeling the air against her skin
she decides to open it a bit more She gets an idea

Standing she looks to see if anyone is around -- though
rationally she knows there isnt a soul for miles She
turns off the porch light With a brave and daring
impulse she sheds her bathrobe and stands naked under
the night sky The air feels good against her body She
opens her arms up against the night sky and moon like an
Indian priestess

Suddenly she starts hitting her body as mosquitoes begin
attacking her bare torso Thwarted she quickly covers
herself with a robe and runs into the house

INT FRANCESCAS BEDROOM - NIGHT 29

Francesca is in front of a full-length mirror her robe
opened applying Calomine lotion to insect bites
Suddenly she stops to notice her body

CAMERA ANGLES OVER her shoulder It is the first time in
years she has actually stopped to look and touch her body
running her hands gently over her curves her neck down
the side of her thighs her face her breasts She stops
She closes her robe and shuts off the light She sits on
the bed

She gets an idea and crosses to a jewelry box on her
bureau She searches through it then removes a section
to reveal another compartment It is filled with things
she hasnt worn in years -- out of date earrings pins
etc Lying amongst these items is an Italian-looking
medallion on a chain She holds it lovingly and puts it
on Crossing to the window she looks out and she sees
the water pump Robert used that day

realize we are seeing it THROUGH Roberts camera lens

Once the FOCUS is SET Robert notices something is tacked

is running out -- pulls it down thumbtack and all

and shoves it into his pocket unread
He returns to his camera to take his shots

Francesca sits at the kitchen table in her bathrobe with
a cup of coffee -- a comic portrait of shame and self-

pity

Her hair is a mess she hasnt showered or dressed and
she stares into space while listening to the bluesy
Chicago RADIO station

The sink is full of dirty dishes she refuses to clean
Beside it is an ashtray of butts from the night before
She carries it over to the table and begins fingering
for a butt to smoke in desperation She lights up and
stares into space

INT SLOW BEND SALOONRESTAURANT - DAY ‘ 40

One of two eating establishments in Winterset A lunch
time crowd fills the place Robert is seated at the
counter He can sense their eyes on him wondering who
this stranger is and whats he doing here He knows the
whispered conversation is about him

A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE talk at table

WIFE
Thelma told me he checked into the
Motor Inn and the bill goes to

National Geographic Magazine

HUSBAND
National Geographic What the hells

pygmies to take pictures of

WIFE

bridges

HUSBAND

Aint no pygmies there either

Robert wants to finish his lunch as quickly as possible

At that moment someone enters the restaurant and all the

conversation stops He overhears one WAITRESS turn to a
SECOND WAITRESS and whisper --

40

WAITRESS
God Its Lucy Redfield

WAITRESS 2
(whispering back)
Apparently Mrs Delaney caught
them

The First Waitress gasps

WAITRESS 2°
Ran right into them in Des Moines
in the middle of her shopping

Roberts curiosity gets the better of him and he subtly
turns his head to see

The REDFIELD WOMAN But instead of being the harlot we
might think shes actually a rather plain demure-
looking woman

As she crosses to the counter Robert immediately picks
up on the vibes in the room He notices all the patrons
Stare then turn away to whisper The Waitress behind
the counter ignores her while the Second Waitress

heads to the kitchen A customer eating at the counter
places a bag on an empty stool beside her so the
Redfield Woman cant sit down near her

Robert and the Redfield Womans eyes meet She is clearly
uncomfortable She turns about to leave when Robert
clears his cameras off a stool next to him and offers

ROBERT
Got room right here if you like

She is surprised at his courtesy Others are astounded
Some disgusted She accepts his offer and sits beside
him

REDFIELD WOMAN
Thank you

ROBERT
Hot out there today

She nods and smiles The Waitress tosses a menu at her
and slams down a glass of water then moves on down the
counter The Redfield Woman tries to act casual glancing
through the menu Robert subtly scans the room as all
eyes are on them then turns away

( )

«42 40

Rebert returns his glance back to the Redfield Woman who
is now only pretending to read the menu She is so
embarrassed She wants to leave but cant move

WAITRESS
Well are you ordering anything

Her harsh tone startles the Redfield Woman as well as
Robert Gathering her dignity she responds

REDFIELD WOMAN
No Thank you Ive changed my
mind

She politely nods to Robert gathers her things and exits
Robert looks to the Waitress as the Second Waitress
ENTERS FRAME

WAITRESS 2
I dve thrown that water right in
her face

WAITRESS
Poor Mrs Delaney

The Waitress walks 0S leaving the Second Waitress
facing Robert who looks at her curiously The Second

Waitress looks back as if to say What business is it
of yours and exits

waters a little bit

ROBERT
Isnt it awful about poor Mrs
Delaney

With this the dam bursts --

CASHIER
Tragic is more like it The pain
that woman has been subjected to
by that no-good husband I never
liked him Known him for years
People say hes quiet Well its
the quiet ones that can sneak up
behind you and stab you in the
back LI-heard yesterday that she
confronted him Gave him the
ultimatum and you know what he
did

INT DES MOINES DRESS SHOP - DAY 44

Francesca sits in her slip alone in a dressing room
with several dresses strewn about The panic of inde-
cision has set in She looks at herself in the mirror
and begins to doubt that seeing Robert is a good idea
Or perhaps shes imagining something that isnt there
And what about Richard

( )

Francesca feels guilty when a SALESWOMAN enters with a

pretty summer dress

SALESWOMAN
How about this one

Francesca examines it She likes it But the guilt

FRANCESCA

I dont know I havent bought a
dress for myself in so long

(off saleswomans

nod)
I mean I’m just buying a dress
Its not a special o¢casion or
anything Im just shopping
Just shopping for a new dress

That might work And if hes

still mad just tell him you could

have done better but you married
him out of pity That always
works for me

ROBERT

I now know more about their affair
than I remember about my marriage

(seriously)
If its a problem for you to see
me tonight given the curiosity of
small town people dont feel
pressured to do it Im not
always so bright about other
peoples reactions and the last
thing I want to do is to put you
in any kind of situation that
would

FRANCESCA
(disappointed)
I understand
(touched)
Thats very kind of you

Both want to meet Both experience the idea of

not seeing each other ever again in this brief moment
Someone has to say something to save it -- but who will

it be

FRANCESCA
Robert

( ) 45

ROBERT
Yeah

FRANCESCA
I want you to come

Robert is relieved

FRANCESCA

each other

He extends his hand She pauses then takes it He leads
her to the bridge

CAMERA begins to PULL BACK and HOLD ON the scene Kincaid
is in his element moving about with ease as he works to
capture the gorgeous light Francesca is enjoying
watching this performance -- his grace the way the
muscles in his forearms are working the way he moves

his body As Kincaid moves into the creek and then up
the other bank she walks through the bridge to the other
side When she comes out the other end he is crouched
down and pointing a camera toward her He shoots three
shots in rapid succession as Francesca walks toward him
She grins in mild embarrassment Robert smiles back and
continues his work

Francesca lounges in a tub with a beer poured into a wine

breath watching a few drops of water fall from the shower

FRANCESCA (V0)
I realized that he had been here

intensely erotic Almost
everything about Robert Kincaid
had begun to seem erotic to me

Robert is at the radio when Francesca enters in her new
dress She looks beautiful And its all over Roberts
face —

Whats wrong

Roberts voice is a little shaky a little rough but his
admiration is genuine

ROBERT
If you dont mind my boldness you
look stunning Make-me-run-around-

She smiles and meets his gaze reveling for a monent in
his reaction

On the RADIO we hear DINAH WASHINGTON begin to sing If
Its The Last Thing I Do -- a beautiful bluesy lovesong

The PHONE RINGS Francesca makes no move to answer it on
the first RING or the second In the long silence
between the second and third RINGS Robert takes a deep
breath and looks down at his camera bags

Francesca is finally able to move across the kitchen to
answer the phone Robert quietly takes a seat his back
to Francesca The SONG PLAYS throughout

FRANCESCA
Hello Hi Madge

Francesca reaches out casually smoothes out the collar
on Roberts shirt then leaves her hand on his shoulder

FRANCESCA
Huh-huh Nothing just making
myself some dinner No what

Oh I heard about him Yeah I

photographer

She can feel the muscle running from his neck along his
shoulder to the back of his collarbone She is conscious
of how warm his body feels through his shirt Madge
babbles on

FRANCESCA
No I didnt Huh-huh
Hippie I don’t know is that
what hippies look like

Robert slowly shakes his head and smiles He sits
perfectly still not wanting to make any noise that
would make Madge wonder

FRANCESCA
Well listen I was just getting
ready to step into a bath when you

called so I better run No they
dont get home until Friday
morning Well maybe Ill give

you a call Okay Bye

Francesca hangs up reluctant to move her hand from his
shoulder Robert takes it in his rises and turns to
face her He slips his free hand around her waist

They begin to dance to the song The kitchen lights

have not been turned on since the sun went down The sky
a dark orange and magenta illuminates the room through
the window They never take their eyes off each other”

ROBERT
Youre shaking Are you cold

Francesca shakes her head They dance a bit more but
Francesca is shaking which makes it difficult They
both stop

Robert places his huge hands on either side of her face
gently stroking her hair away from her cheek He
whispers

ROBERT
° ant me to s e 1
mow

He brushes his cheek and face softly against hers
Francesca rubs hers barely breathing

ROBERT
Francesca -- I wont be sorry I
wont apologize for this

FRANCESCA
Nobodys asked you to

They kiss Hands gently explore Their bodies touch
Their lips never spend more than seconds away from each
other Robert slides his hands down her breasts and
torso exploring every inch of her Francesca grips
his massive back sliding up to his neck and hair
Robert lifts her leg and presses it against his hip
kissing her neck and shoulders Francesca starts to
lose herself clutching his head to her breast then
pulling him up to her mouth once again

The two sit in bathrobes on the porch looking out over
the pasture They have bowls of catmeal on their laps
They eat voraciously

Robert leans over picks a pot up off the porch and
ladles some more onto his plate Too much falls out and
it spills onto the robe Francesca giggles Robert
glares at her jokingly

Francesca hands him a dish rag Robert wipes off the
food revealing his bare leg She reaches over and
touches it He looks at her and smiles She leans over
and kisses him passionately until suddenly she pulls
away She looks upset She rises and moves away to look
out to the pasture Robert can sense what is wrong

FRANCESCA
I feel like Im getting a little
out of control Its kind of
frightening

FRANCESCA (V0)
I had thoughts about him I hardly
knew what to do with And he
read every one Whatever I felt
whatever I wanted he gave
himself up to And in that
moment everything I knew to be
true about myself up until then
was gone I was acting like
another woman -- yet I was more
myself than ever before

Francesca looks at him and understands he is giving her
full permission to explore whatever she wants
Hesitantly she crosses to him and takes his plate away

She stands before him leaning him back into his chair
She slowly tentatively opens her robe

Theyre not photographs -- theyre
stories entire histories
captured in moments You should
be published Your own
collection

ROBERT
No one would buy it

FRANCESCA
Why do you say that

ROBERT
Because thats what six
publishers told me

Francesca is surprised She senses his disappointment

ROBERT
Its no big heartache Whatever
makes an artist look like an
artist to the world -- is just a
feature I dont have

FRANCESCA
Maybe you have to convince
yourself first Maybe you do
have to ask why its an obsession

He smiles and considers what she is saying She takes
the chain with her medallion off from around her neck and
puts it on Robert

ROBERT
Whats this

remember the last time my husband
made love to me so intensely that
he transported me to Africa for
Christs sakes -- quite frankly I
dont think he ever did And now
I find out that in between bake
sales my mother was Anais Nin

MICHAEL
What about me I feel really
weird Like she cheated on me
not Dad Isnt that sick You
know being the only son you sort
of feel like youre the prince of
the kingdom And in the back of
your mind you kind of think your
mother doesn’t need sex anymore
because she has you

CAROLYN
Youre right -- that is sick

They drink

MICHAEL
If she was so unhappy why didnt
she leave

They look to each other without an answer Then simul-

Do you write them now and then
How do you manage it

Her facetiousness startles Robert
ROBERT

FRANCESCA
Well I just want to know the
procedure I don’t want to upset
your routine Do you want any
jam
ROBERT
(insulted)
Routine I dont have a routine
And if you think thats what this
is --
FRANCESCA
Well what is this
ROBERT
(upset)
Why is that up to me Youre the
one whos married You told me
you have no intention of leaving
your husband
FRANCESCA
To do what Be with someone who
needs everyone and no one in
particular I mean what would
be the point Would you pass the
butter
ROBERT
I was honest with you
FRANCESCA
Yes Absolutely You have this
habit of not needing and that
its hard to break I understand
(beat)
Of course in that case why
sleep -- you dont need rest or
for that matter eat you dont
need food

She takes his plate away from him rises and throws it
into the sink

ROBERT
What are you doing

FRANCESCA
(sarcastic)
Gee I don’t know I guess Im
mot cut out to be a world citizen
who experiences everything and
nothing at the same time

( ) 63

ROBERT
How do you know what I experience

FRANCESCA
(angry )
I know you What can this possibly
mean to anyone who doesn’t need

meaning --
(mocking)

Who goes with the Mystery -- who
pretends he isnt scared to death
ROBERT

Stop it
FRANCESCA

After you leave Im going to

have to wonder for the rest of

my life what happened here If
anything happened at all And
Ill have to wonder if you find
yourself in some housewifes
kitchen in Romania if youll sit
there and tell her about your
world of good friends and secretly
include me in that group

ROBERT
What do you want me to say

FRANCESCA
(nonchalantly)
I dont want you to say anything
I dont need you to say anything

Robert rises knocking his chair aside

Fine More eggs or should we just
fuck on the linoleum one last time

(grabs her)
Itold you I wont apologize

for who I am

FRANCESCA
No ones asking you to

ROBERT
I wont be made to feel like Ive
done something wrong 63

FRANCESCA

(angry)
You wont be made to feel Period
Youve carved out this little
part for yourself in the world
where you get to be a voyeur 4
hermit and a lover whenever you
feel like it and the rest of us
are just supposed to feel so
incredibly grateful for the brief
time youve touched our lives
Well go to hell It isnt human
not to feel lonely -- it isnt
human not to be afraid Youre a
hypocrite and youre a phony

He throws a cup at the wall It breaks apart Covering

sink Francesca reaches for him but he pulls away
embarrassed

FRANCESCA
(softly)

Dont you see Ive got to know
the truth Robert Ive got to
know the truth or Ill go crazy
Either way Just tell me But I
cant act like this is enough
because it has to be I cant
pretend I dont feel what I

Robert keeping his face from her tries to tell her

ROBERT
If Ive done anything to make you
think that whats happened
between us is nothing new for me
- is some routine -- then I do
apologize

63 63

FRANCESCA
What makes it different Robert

Robert turns to face her He is so hopelessly in love he
can hardly find the words His eyes fill up with tears

ROBERT
Because if I asked myself
right now why I make pictures
the only reason I could come up
with -- the only reason it seems
Ive been anywhere and done
anything -- was to bring me here
Right now it looks like the only
thing Ive done all my life was
to make my way to you And if I

even think about tomorrow -- if I
«es even think about leaving here
without you -- Im not sure I --

He shakes his head He can’t even finish He kneels
down before her wrapping his arms around her and burying

his face into her body Francesca starts to cry -- out
of happiness out of pain -- holding onto him as if for
dear life
FRANCESCA
Oh God what are we going to do
She kisses him -- over and over not wanting to be even

an inch apart As if any space between them might
separate them forever

Suddenly 0S they hear a CAR DRIVE UP to the house
They panic Francesca runs to the window to see

MADGE a girlfriend has come for a visit Madge is
holding a homemade dessert

FRANCESCA
No No Wheres your truck

INT BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY 66

Francesca enters to find Robert lying on the bed fully
clothed She sits beside him He strokes her arm then
guides her to lie down Once shes in his arms he
speaks

ROBERT
Come with me

Francesca knew he was going to say this Either answer
she gives frightens her

FRANCESCA
Hold me

She turns to him and they embrace Robert however
fears only one response

CUT TO

INT KITCHEN - EVENING 67

MUSIC PLAYS OVER the next few images CAMERA SLOWLY PANS
FROM the RADIO upon which the SONG is playing TO a
beautifully set table and candles It ARRIVES ON Robert
preparing dinner He stands at the sink rinsing out some
utensils Waiting for the water to turn hot he looks
out THROUGH the window above the sink He sees a beauti-
ful view of the night He pauses as it strikes him that
this is a view Francesca has seen a million times -- that
soon she would not see ever again

CUT TO

INT BEDROOM - SAME TIME 68

CAMERA PANS the room FROM two opened suitcases as
Francesca packs to leave She is wearing a red dress
with buttons down the front

She moves about the room as if with blinders on --
focused on her task refusing to take in any signs or
memories that might hinder her Francesca tries to open
one of the bureau drawers and it gees stuck She pauses
for a moment then gathers her bags

CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she exits the bedroom with her
suitcases then walks down the hall to the stairs then
down the staircase to the front hall

INT FRONT HALLLIVING ROOM 69

She quietly sets the suitcases down hearing the RADIO

‘and ROBERT in the kitchen She pauses then enters the

living room One of the throw pillows has fallen off the
couch

She replaces it then takes a moment to look about the
room She slowly sits down on the couch

Robert appears in the doorway and stands there looking at
her until she sees him and smiles

ROBERT
Ive got dinner
CUT TO
INT KITCHEN - EVENING 70

They eat in silence Neither is very hungry

ROBERT —
Would you like a beer

She smiles and shakes her head Robert opens a bottle
and takes a sip The silence between them is becoming
awkward

Pause Robert takes another sip Then knowing full
well what hangs heavy between them he asks

ROBERT
Youre not coming with me are
you

Francesca stops pretending to eat She looks at him
having forgotten how well he can read her

FRANCESCA
No matter how I keep turning it
around in my mind -- it doesnt

seem like the right thing

ROBERT
For who

FRANCESCA
For anyone They’1ll never be
able to live through the talk
Richard could never get his arms
around this

(MORE)

( )

FRANCESCA (CONTD)
He doesnt deserve that He
hasnt hurt anyone in his life

ROBERT
(getting
aggressive)
Then he can move People move

FRANCESCA
His family’s lived here for almost
a hundred years Richard doesnt
know how to live anywhere else
And the kids

ROBERT
The kids are grown They dont
need you anymore You told me
that They hardly talk to you

FRANCESCA
No they dont say much But
Carolyns 16 Shes just about
to find out about all this for
herself -- shes going to fall
in love she’s going to try and
figure out how to build a life
with someone If I leave what
does that say to her

ROBERT
What about us

FRANCESCA
Youve got to know deep down that
the minute we leave here itll
all change

ROBERT

Yeah It could get better

FRANCESCA
No matter how much distance we put
between us and this house I bring
it with me and Ill feel it
every minute were together And
Ill blame loving you for how much
it hurts And then even these
four days wont be anything more
than something sordid and a
mistake

( ) 70

ROBERT

(desperately)
Francesca listen to me You
think whats happened to us
happens to just anybody What
we feel for each other How
much we feel Were not even
two separate people anymore
Some people search their whole
lives for it and wind up alone
-- most people dont even think
it exists and youre going to
tell me that giving it up is
the right thing to do

FRANCESCA
We are the choices weve made
Robert

Robert rises and turns his back on her

FRANCESCA
Robert Please
(desperate)
You dont understand -- no one

does When a woman makes the
choice to marry to have children
-- in one way her life begins but
in another way it stops You
build a life of details You
become a mother a wife and you
stop and stay steady so that your
children can move And when they
leave they take your life of
details with them And then
youre expected to move again
only you dont remember what
moves you because no one has
asked in so long Not even
yourself You never in your

life think that love like this
can happen to you

ROBERT
But now that you have it --

FRANCESCA
I want to keep it forever I want
to love you the way I do now the
rest of my life

(MORE )

( )

70 FRANCESCA (CONTD)
Dont you understand -- well
lose it if we leave I cant
maké an entire life disappear
to start a new one All I can
do is try to hold onto us both
Help me Help me not lose
loving you

She embraces him He wraps his arms around her He
whispers

ROBERT
Dont leave me Dont leave me
alone Please

This breaks her heart knowing how hard it is for him to
say this She holds him tighter until --
ROBERT

Listen Maybe you feel this way

maybe you dont Maybe its just

because youre in this house

Maybe maybe when they come back

tomorrow youll feel differently

Dont you think thats possible

FRANCESCA
I dont know Please

ROBERT
Im going to be here a few more
days Ill be at the inn We
have some time Lets not say any

FRANCESCA
No Dont do this
ROBERT

saying goodbye Were not making
any decision Maybe youll change
your mind Maybe well accidentally
run into each other and youll
change your mind

FRANCESCA
Robert if that happens youll
have to decide I wont be able
to 70

She cries in his arms He kisses her as if for the last
time Then quickly separates himself and leaves the
house Looking back toward the house at Francesca

ROBERT
Ill never say this any other
time to anyone and I want you
to remember it This kind of
certainty comes only once and
never again No matter how many
lifetimes you live

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE 71

Robert walks briskly towards his truck not wanting to
look back He gets in STARTS IT UP and drives away

Francesca exits the house and watches the truck recede
into the distance She stops when she reaches the front
gate leaning against it She murmurs to herself --

FRANCESCA
Keep going Please

The truck drives away Then suddenly stops
Francescas heart quickens She watches as the truck
stands on the road in the distance

As if Robert was deciding to turn around or keep going
Francesca waits Suddenly the door to the truck flies
open and Robert exits Francesca loses all restraint

She opens the gate but her dress is caught on it Robert
stands by the truck Francesca tears at the dress
ripping off a button which falls to the ground She runs
down the road Seeing her Robert runs towards her as
well

They grab each other furiously For these few moments
all considerations are gone

CAMERA PANS UP TO the road beyond Roberts truck
We see Richards truck driving towards them For a
moment it seems as if they will be caught until we

realize Richards truck is being SUPERIMPOSED as the
light gradually brightens to reveal

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - MORNING 72

Richard Michael and Carolyn drive down the road toward
the house

Roberts truck and all traces of him are gone

Francesca steps into the doorway in a house-dress to
welcome her family home -- wondering how this will feel

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY 74

pulling me further and further
away from those four days

EXT MAINSTREET (WINTERSET) - DAY 76

A light rain is beginning to fail

Richard and Francesca drive up to the general store to
buy groceries Francesca heads for the store as Richard
crosses the street

FRANCESCA
Want anything special for dinner

RICHARD
Hmmm How about that brown sugar
meat loaf you make

FRANCESCA
(smiles)
Okay
She enters the store
INT GENERAL STORE - DAY 77

Francesca makes small talk with the grocery lady as she
buys what she needs

CUT TO

EXT MAIN STREET - DAY 78
The rain has gotten heavier

Francesca places a bag of groceries on the front seat of
the truck then gets in herself to wait for Richard She
takes a deep breath and removes a handkerchief from her
bag to wipe the raindrops from her face She freezes --

THROUGH the windshield she sees Robert standing in the
rain beside his truck across the street staring at her
Her heart stops For a moment she isnt even sure hes
real

The town moves about its business around them But
neither notice or care Whatever safety or forgetfulness
she felt is gone Her feelings burst through She sits
there helpless before him -- willing to go or stay
depending on what he did

He begins walking towards her She prepares herself
Her life will change -- it has to Theres no turning
back

But the closer Robert gets the clearer he can see that
she is crying And he stops

78 78

Without any words he realizes what taking her with him
would mean With just a glance he sacrifices her With
their eyes locked in the middle of Main Street -- in
front of the whole town -- they smile and say goodbye

Robert returns to his truck He drives off down Main
Street

Moments later Richard throws the feed bag into the back
of his truck and gets in Francesca is wiping her eyes

He doesn’t notice He drives off in the same direction
as Robert

FRANCESCA (V0)
For a moment I didn’t know where
I was And for a split second
the thought crossed my mind that
he really didnt want me -- that
it was easy to walk away

78A EXT WINTERSET STREET - DAY 784A

Their momentum brings them up right behind the old pick-
up and sitting high in the Chevy Francesca can see a
black tarpaulin lashed down tight in the back outlining
a suitcase and guitar case wedged in next to the spare
tire lying flat The back window is rain-spattered but
part of his head is visible

FRANCESCA (V0O)
Robert leaned over as if to get
something from the glove box
Eight days ago hed done that and
his arm had brushed across my leg
A week ago I had been in Des
Moines buying a new dress

RICHARD
That trucks a long way from home
Washington State I1l bet its
that photographer they been
talkin’ about at the cafe

Francesca doesn’t respond She is struggling to fight
back her tears

78B EXT TWO-WAY STOP - DAY 78B

They follow Kincaid a few blocks north to where 169
intersects with 92 running east to west It is a two-
way stop with heavy cross traffic complicated by the
rain

( )
78B

78B
For maybe twenty seconds they sit there
Francesca’s hand moves to the door handle

FRANCESCA (V0)
Since Robert Kincaid had driven
away from me last Friday I
realized in spite of how much I
thought Id cared for him then I
had nonetheless badly
underestimated my feelings That
didnt seem possible but it was
true I had begun to understand
what he already understood

Francesca sits frozen by her responsibilities staring at
that back window harder than she has ever looked at
anything in her life

RICHARD
Whats he waiting for

Francesca looks up to see that traffic has cleared in
all directions But Robert doesn’t move Francesca
knows he is going through the same thing as she is in
that moment And then she sees ©

Robert knowing Francesca is watching takes off the
medallion and hangs it on his rear-view mirror --
touching it gently as if he were touching her

Richard BEEPS his HORN lightly But Roberts truck just
sits there Francescas eyes begin to tear up Her hand
grips the door handle She doesnt have the strength to
stay -- and she doesnt have the strength to leave

Suddenly Kincaids left signal light comes on Ina
moment hell be gone

Richard fiddles with the Chevys RADIO

Robert slowly eases his old pickup into the intersection
heading west lowering his window to help with visibility
Francesca squints through her tears and the rain and fog
and sees the faded red paint on the door Kincaid

Photography -- Bellingham Washington”

As Robert completes the turn Francesca can see his hair
blowing in the wind from the open window He begins to
accelerate down 92 and rolls up the window

FRANCESCA (V0)
Oh Christ -- oh Jesus Christ
Almighty no’

FRANCESCA (V0O) (CONTD)
The words were inside of me ‘I

was wrong Robert I was wrong to
stay but I cant go ‘Let me

tell you again why I cant go

Tell me again why I should go I
heard his voice coming back down

the highway

ROBERT (V0)
This kind of certainty comes only
once and never again no matter
how many lifetimes you live

Richard takes the truck across the intersection heading
north Francesca looks for a moment past his face toward
the old pickups red taillights moving off into the
distance A huge SEMI-TRAILER RIG ROARS into Winterset
spraying a wave of water over the last cowboy

FRANCESCA
(whispers )
Goodbye Robert Kincaid

She begins to cry openly Richard looks over at her

RICHARD
Whats wrong Franny Will you
please tell me whats wrong with
you

minutes

Francesca enters and places her groceries on the counter
She tries to compose herself She sees the RADIO before

She hears Richard enter the house She stands out of
sight holding her hand to her mouth to muffle her

At dinner Richard remembers the button he found

RICHARD
Oh Franny is this yours

Francesca sees the button She speaks to Richard MOS
The scene continues and her narration is heard

FRANCESCA (V0)
I almost told him In that moment
I felt as if I couldnt hold it
‘back If he really loved me
maybe hed understand

She returns to her meal The family eats in silence

FRANCESCA (V0)
I was grateful for the silence
that night I realized love wont
obey our expectations Its
mystery is pure and absolute
What Robert and I had could not
continue if we were together
What Richard and I shared would
vanish if we were apart But how
I wanted to share this How would
our lives have changed if I had
Could anyone else have seen the
beauty of it

him The town loved talking
