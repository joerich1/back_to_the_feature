HANNAH AND HER SISTERS
by

Woody Allen

As the last credit appears the song ends in a crescendo and
the screen fades to total black

Immediately a new melody begins an uptempo jazz number as
a title appears on the screen

God shes beautiful
CUT TO
INT HANNAHS APARTMENT - NIGHT

A full face of Lee wearing a gray sweater and leaning
against the dining room doorway She gazes into the camera
with a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the
screen

ELLIOT (V0O)
God shes beautiful

Lee glances over her shoulder then turns from the doorway
and walks away The camera follows her moving across a
book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from
view as she walks into a crowded comfortable vestibule
People some holding drinks some just entering the
apartment surround her Everyone is talking at once
carrying on easy familiar conversation

ELLIOT (V0O)
Shes got the prettiest eyes and
she looks so sexy in that sweater

Lee smiles at the various people exchanging greetings

LEE
Hi how are you

Two more guests enter the apartment the vestibule is full
now Still walking Lee lightly hugs one of the children as
she continues on her way towards the living room Elliots
voice as well as the jazzy music is heard

ELLIOT (V0O)
I just want to be alone with her
and hold her and kiss her

Lee walks into the living room turning her head back for a
moment to talk to the child she has just hugged

ELLIOT (V0O)
and tell her how much I love her
and take care of her Stop it you
idiot Shes your wifes sister
But I cant help it

The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops
to chat with her mother Elliots voice as well as the
music continues over the low din of warm conversation

ELLIOT (V0O)
Im consumed by her Its been
months now I dream about her I-
I I think about her at the office
Oh Lee
(sighing)
What am I gonna do

Lee starts to walk off again finishing her conversation
with her mother She passes several other guests then
turns to greet April giving her a warm brief hug

ELLIOT (V0O)
I hear myself mooning over you and
its disgusting Before when she

Elliots voice-over continues as he is actually seen
standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing
rotund man Both are holding drinks as Lee carrying a tray
of hors doeuvres and two drinks walks between them The
space is very tight the men hold up their drinks to make
room for her

ELLIOT (V0O)
squeezed past me in the doorway
and I smelled that perfume on the
back of her neck

Elliot watches Lee walk off the other man oblivious
continues to talk Elliot reluctantly returns to the
conversation but he cant help turning his head to gaze at
the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on

ELLIOT (V0O)
desus I I thought I was gonna
swoon Easy
The camera resumes following a smiling Lee She has just
put down the tray and drinks near April and briskly and
obliviously she walks past a doorway where Elliot still
ruminating watches her entranced

ELLIOT (V0O)
Youre a dignified financial
advisor It doesnt look good for
you to swoon

The camera stays with Elliot who is still watching the
offscreen Lee In the background guests continue to
chatter warmly with each other

Hannah carrying a tray of hors doeuvres walks up behind
the distracted Elliot

HANNAH
(nibbling on an hors doeuvre)
Elliot Elliot
(rubbing his shoulder)
Sweetheart

Elliot returns from his reveries with a start

ELLIOT
(turning to Hannah)
Mm-hm

HANNAH
(pointing to the tray)

wonderful
(nibbling swallowing)
Holly and her friend made them

Elliot taking one of the hors doeuvres starts nibbling as
well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the
living room

ELLIOT
(swallowing)
Theyre fantastic

HANNAH
(overlapping still eating)
Arent they great

ELLIOT

HANNAH
(swallowing)

Elliot and Hannah eating and talking walk past a hallway
and offscreen as Holly appears walking down the hallway
She holds a drink and a plate of hors doeuvres she stands
at the entrance to the hallway eating and looking at the
offscreen guests

HANNAH
(walking offscreen)

Holly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk
over to her
HANNAH

ELLIOT

(overlapping Hannah)

as he nibbles on an
hors doeuvre)

INT HANNAHS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Hannah licking her fingers walks past a memo-cluttered
refrigerator to the stove as Holly behind her begins to
speak The faint sounds of music are still heard

HOLLY

money
(sipping her drink)
Dont get upset

HANNAH
(stirring some food
in a saucepan on the stove)
Mmm I never get upset over that

HOLLY

And Im keeping strict accounts

As Holly talks sipping her drink Hannah busily works in
the kitchen which contains a large center table stacked
with bowls and plates of food hanging pots and pans and
general party clutter She walks on-and-offscreen as she
talks and listens to her sister

HANNAH
Holly please Dont insult me

HOLLY
(putting her empty
glass and plate down
on the table)
Someday Ill pay it all back

HANNAH

HOLLY
Two thousand dollars

Hannah whod been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby
counter hesitates momentarily She turns to Holly

HANNAH
(trying to nod her
head casually)
Uh-huh
HOLLY
(gesturing her back
to the camera)
Hannah I know its a lot but my
friend April and I we have this
catering idea I thinks going to be

Hannah licking her fingers walks past Holly
HOLLY

(turning to face Hannah)
You admit that were great cooks

HANNAH
(nodding back at the
stove now stirring
in a pot)

HOLLY

(putting her hands in

her pockets)

outstanding

HANNAH
(looking at her sister)
Will you just tell me one thing

HOLLY
(nodding)
Okay

HANNAH
Are we talking about cocaine again

HOLLY
(shaking her head no)
I swear I swear Weve already
got some requests to do a few
dinner parties

A timer goes off Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some
food on a different stove Holly turns to face her Only
Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah the
camera moving in closer on her face As Holly speaks she
distractedly nibbles an hors doeuvre In the background
her parents can be heard singing in the living room

HOLLY
I mean obviously Im not going to
be a caterer forever you know We
both still go to auditions
Something could turn up at any
moment But the parties are at
night days are free I can still
take my acting class I havent
done drugs on a year

Holly pops another hors doeuvre into her mouth as the
background singing gets louder and the film cuts to

HOLLY
(whispering intently)

Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily
takes another sip of her drink

And the film cuts briefly back to the living room where
Evan is still playing the piano and singing The camera
moves past him and a few guests to Norma who is
enthusiastically singing along looking at Evan and moving
her hands

EVAN and NORMA
(singing)

As Holly continues to tease her sister Hannah opens a
drawer in the cabinet She takes out two apples decorated
with paper turkey heads and tails and hands them to April

Hannah will invite some men over
who dont look like Ichabod Crane

bemused Hannah takes two more out of the cabinet and places
one of them on the table as well

television producer walks out deep in conversation with
his assistants Paul and Larry As the elevator operator
begins to reclose the door with his passengers Mickey his
assistants fast behind walks down an office corridor past
busy groups of studio personnel Indistinct conversation
as well as the jazz is heard in the background as the trio
talk

MICKEY

They think its too dirty

The trio pass Mary another assistant in conversation with

two other co-workers She holds a clipboard

MICKEY
(to Paul)
You know whatd they do figure
out what the words mean

A foursome now they briskly walk past a man and a woman
going over a script Mary and Mickey lead Paul and Larry
follow

MARY

As the group walks through a large doorway Larry catches up
to Mickey

They are all now seen walking down the new corridor towards
the camera The corridor is crowded with busy TV personnel
The group continues to talk frantically as people hurry past
them One man pushes rudely past Mary as he walks she
looks back at him briefly

PAUL
(continuing)

MICKEY
(gesturing)
I dont know how they can do that
to us Thats-- We go on in thirty
minutes right

Mary checks her wristwatch as they rush down the corridor

LARRY
(squeezing past
several passersby)
Theyre doing it because our
ratings are low

MICKEY
(nervously rubbing
his forehead)
I got such a migraine
As the group briskly walks past an open door Gail another
assistant runs out brandishing her glasses

GAIL
(offscreen)
Hey Mickey

Gail runs in front of the group Without missing a step
she faces Mickey and walks backwards gesturing and talking
frantically

GAIL
Mickey Listen we better go right
to Ronnys dressing room This kid
must have taken sixteen hundred
Quaaludes I dont think hes
going to be able to do the show

The fast-tracking group turns the corner Gail pats Mickeys
back she gestures in exasperation

MICKEY
(gesturing towards heaven)
Why me Lord What did I--

He is interrupted by Ed Smythe an official from the
Standards and Practices Department whos been standing in
the corridor waiting for Mickey Mickey stops and shakes
Eds hand as if hed known the official would be there
Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a
background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying
personnel

Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer Ed forgotten
with this new crisis

MICKEY
(gesturing)

WRITER
The whole premise is ruined

Mickey Gail and the writer start walking down a corridor
adjacent to the studio

MICKEY
(gesturing trying to
calm the writer down)
Oh youre crazy Its not so

The writer reacts angrily Gail tries to get Mickeys
attention as they walk

GAIL

the screen

(sighing)
Oh God I hope theres nothing

Mickey pushes open the outside door of Dr Abels office as
the movie cuts to the doctors consultation room The
doctor is framed in the doorway looking through a file
cabinet

DR ABEL
(taking out Mickeys file)
So whats the uh problem this time

MICKEY
(offscreen)
This time I really think I have
something

While Mickey answers him offscreen Dr Abel turns and walks
toward him The camera follows the doctors movements from
the other side of the wall obscuring him briefly

It moves across a dark examining-room wall to a second
doorway where Mickey sits on a stool continuing to talk to
the offscreen Dr Abel
MICKEY
(onscreen)
I mean Im absolutely convinced
that-that-- You know I mean its
not like that adenoidal thing you
know where I didnt realize I had
them out

Dr Abel walks back onscreen Both he and Mickey are now
seen through the second doorway Dr Abel sniffs and stands
directly in front of the sitting Mickey He stares down at
him as Mickey talks

MICKEY
(continuing gesturing)
So so but it was when I was
younger so--

DR ABEL
(overlapping interrupting)
You know I saw your father this
week about his sinus

MICKEY
(folding his arms on
his chest)

Mm-hm
DR ABEL
(continuing)
and uh he complained of chest
pains
MICKEY

Well this guys the real
hypochondriac of the family I

DR ABEL
(interrupting)
You mentioned on the phone that

his knees)
Yes a little dizziness and I

hearing loss in my right ear

(poking at his ears

and gesturing)

my right my right my right or my
left ear

Dr Abel chuckles

MICKEY
(nodding and gesturing)
Now I ca-cant remember

DR ABEL
Lets take a look

An uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to
Mickeys examination beginning with a close-up of Dr Abel
using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey
Next is a hearing test The film shows the doctorss hands
turning the dials on a sonometer Mickey sits on a nearby
high stool large earphones on his head He listens with
such concentration that he squints his eyes He holds up a
finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset
Finally the film shows Dr Abel hitting a large turning

fork with his finger He puts the vibrating fork to Mickeys
ear Mickey looking up at the offscreen doctors face nods

The music stops as the film cuts back to Dr Abels
consultation room Dr Abel walks from the examining room
through the consultation room to a second examining room
across the way He talks to the offscreen Mickey as he walks

DR ABEL
Well Im sorry to say you have had
a significant drop in the high-
decibel range of your right ear

MICKEY
(offscreen)
Really

Dr Abel moves offscreen in the second examining room The
camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the
doctor and Mickey talk offscreen

DR ABEL
(offscreen)
Have you been exposed to a loud
noise recently or did you have a
virus

MICKEY
(offscreen)
No I-Ive been perfectly healthy
You know me
Dr Abel briefly passes by the doorway

MICKEY
(offscreen)
I always I-I always imagine that I
have things

DR ABEL
(offscreen)
When did you first notice this

MICKEY
(offscreen)
Oh uh about a month ago Wha-
what do I have

Looking preoccupied Dr Abel walks back into the
consultation room holding Mickeys open file He strides
over to his desk revealing a frightened Mickey sitting in
a chair opposite it Still standing the doctor leans over
the desk his back to the camera and makes a few notes in
the file

DR ABEL
Youve had some dizzy spells
(sighing)

What about ringing and buzzing
Have you uh noticed any of that

MICKEY
(gesturing)
Yes now-now that you mention it
uh I-I-I have uh buzzing and
also ringing Ringing and buzzing
Um am I going deaf or something

DR ABEL
(making more notes in
the file)

And its just in one ear

MICKEY
(picking at his fingers)
Yes is it is it uh healthier to
have problems in both ears

Dr Abel chuckles as he closes Mickeys file and straightens
up The camera looks past his back and shoulders to the
anxious Mickey
DR ABEL
(his face offscreen)
What Id like to do is to make an
appointment for you at the hospital
Id like to have them run some tests

MICKEY
The hospital What kind of tests

Dr Abel lays his pen across Mickeys closed file He walks
around his desk and sits on its edge close to Mickey

DR ABEL
(sighing)
Now dont get alarmed These are
just more sophisticated audiometry
tests than I can run here
(gesturing)

(gesturing)

Well if its nothing then why do

HOLLY
(offscreen)

The film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio
sitting in Davids Jaguar across the street David and
April sit in the front seat Holly sits scrunched up in
back her head slightly forward

DAVID

(gesturing looking

back and forth from

the buildings to

Holly and April)
The designs deliberately
noncontextural But I wanted to
keep the atmosphere of the street
you know and the proportions

HOLLY
(nodding)
Uh-huh

DAVID
And in the material
Thatsthats unpolished red
granite
(pausing as he
watches Holly and
Aprils reaction)

HOLLY
Oh

APRIL
(overlapping)
Oh is that what it is

HOLLY
(starting to speak)
Uh--
APRIL
(interrupting
nodding at Holly)
I-i-it has an o-organic quality
you know

HOLLY
(nodding overlapping)
Right

APRIL

(looking back at the

building with reverence)
Its almostalmost uhhh entirely
wholly interdependent if you know
what I mean I-I I cant put it
into words The important thing
is-is-is it-it breathes

DAVID
(turning to April emphatically)
You know April people pass by
vital structures in this city all
the time and they never take the
time to appreciate them I get the
feeling you tune in to your

environment
APRIL
(shaking her head)
Oh--
HOLLY
(interrupting

gesturing and nodding)
Oh its really important

David turns and briefly glances at Holly he then turns back
to April

APRIL
(looking only at David)
What are your favorite buildings
David

DAVID
You want to see some
APRIL
(nodding)
Oh yeah

DAVID
Well lets do it

APRIL
(looking at David)
Great

David starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding
visual excursion through New York Citys landmark buildings
as seen from the trios point of view in the moving Jaguar
Inspiring classical music plays in the background

The series of shots includes the Dakota complete with
surrounding winter trees the Graybar building on Lexington
Avenue an incredibly ornate building on Seventh Avenue and
Fifty-eighth Street a red-stone church an old building
with embellished bulging windows on West Forty-fourth
Street the Art Deco Chrysler Building a red-brick building
Abigail Adamss old stone house and the Pomander Walk
nestled off Broadway on the Upper West Side The group can
be seen walking down the path between the old-fashioned row
houses and shrubbery A lamppost sits in the foreground

It is now dark The music continues to play as the film
cuts to the fagade of a rococo-style building complete with
French doors and ornate windows The admiring group is
heard offscreen

HOLLY
(offscreen)
Oh its just so romantic I just
want to put on a long gown

DAVID
(offscreen overlapping)
Yes

HOLLY
(offscreen continuing)
and open the French doors and go
on the balcony --

APRIL
(offscreen interrupting)
Its French though It really is

HOLLY
(offscreen)
Yeah

APRIL
(offscreen overlapping)
It feels like youre in France

DAVID
(offscreen overlapping)
It-it is Its romantic
The music stops The screen which has been exploring the

rococo buildings facade now shows the equally elegant
building alongside it

DAVID
(offscreen)
And its got a handsome partner
sitting right beside it

HOLLY
(offscreen)
Yeah

DAVID
(offscreen overlapping)
They fit right in together And
your eye goes along lulled into
complacency and then

The film moves from the two elegant fagade to show an ugly
ultra-modern structure covered with tiny diamond-shaped
motifs

APRIL
(offscreen)

Thats just --
DAVID

(offscreen interrupting)
Look at this

HOLLY
(offscreen)
Thats disgusting

APRIL
(offscreen continuing)

HOLLY
(offscreen overlapping)
Its really terrible

DAVID

(offscreen emphatically)
Its really sad

HOLLY
(offscreen)
And it ruins everything else

DAVID
(offscreen agreeing)
It does

The film moves from the ugly facade to the buildings

equally ugly entrance A large car is parked right in front
of the building

APRIL
(offscreen)
Wellwe have seen a lot of stuff
today though

HOLLY
(offscreen chuckling)
Yeah
DAVID
(offscreen overlapping)

APRIL
(offscreen overlapping)

The group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance
stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the
street where theyd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly
facades across the way David is in the lead the women
follow Holly slightly behind April

HOLLY
(nodding)
Yeah

DAVID
(glancing at his watch)
Maybe we should start thinking
about going home huh

HOLLY

David leans over the roof of the car looking at the women
waiting for their decision

APRIL

(gesturing)

(overlapping)
Well wait You know what I know

HOLLY
(nodding nervously)
Oh okay

APRIL
(overlapping nodding)
Great

They get into the car Once again Hollys in the backseat
The classical music begins anew

The movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a
Manhattan avenue as seen from the moving Jaguar It then
moves to a close-up of Holly sitting in the backseat her
head near the window She is staring straight ahead

HOLLY (VO)

Naturally I get taken home first
Well obviously he prefers April
Of course I was so tongue-tied all
night I cant believe I said that
about the Guggenheim My stupid
little roller-skating joke I
should never tell jokes Mom can
tell em and Hannah but I kill ‘em

(glaring at the

offscreen Aprils back)
Where did April come up with that
stuff about Adolph Loos and terms
like organic form

(looking out the side

window pausing for a moment)
Well naturally She went to
Brandeis

The movie cuts to Hollys point of view the front seat

where David and April sit the Jaguars windshield and the
passing lights and traffic of the street Holly continues
her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David

HOLLY (VO)

But I dont think she knows what
shes talking about Could you
believe the way she was calling him
David Yes David I feel that
way too David What a marvelous
space David

(emphatically)
I hate April Shes pushy

The film moves back to Holly in the backseat still lost in
thought
HOLLY (VO)

Now theyll dump me and shell

(sighing looking out

the side window)
And I really like him a lot Oh

The classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins The
screen cuts to black and a title appears

nobody not even the rain has such small hands

cut To

EXT STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICKS LOFT - DAY

The movie briefly holds on a ripped red paint-splattered
door as Elliot wearing a raincoat appears nearby He
looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of
view Fredericks loft building

The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot hes looking
around him He glances at his watch as the film cuts back
once again to the loft building where Lee finally appears
walking down the street away from Elliot A truck passes
down the street Lee doesnt see him She walks further
and further away she turns a corner

Elliot frantically looks around again then in a burst of
decision he runs around a garbage dump crossing the
street and still running he moves down an adjacent street
past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings
as the film cuts back to Lee walking down a different
street oblivious

The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between
the fast-moving Elliot rushing down the SoHo streets past
a truck waiting for a light to change past some pedestrians
some garbage cans turning corners and the strolling Lee
walking up different streets past different buildings

Lee eventually crosses a street lost in thought looking
right and left as Elliot pretending nonchalance waits on
the corner looking at his watch She looks up in surprise
the music stops

ELLIOT
(trying not to sound
out of breath)
Oh my goodness

LEE
(overlapping smiling
in surprise)

Oh Elliot
ELLIOT

to Lee)

ELLIOT

They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior
of the Pageant Book and Print Shop an old serious bookstore
A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf-
like bookcases which are packed row after row with books
An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the
camera moves down an aisle past the rows of books A piano
playing Bewitched is heard Pictures hang on the aisle
ends of the shelves

CUT TO
INT FREDERICKS LOFT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lee in slacks and shirt is curled up on the bed her back
to the camera as she reads the ee cummings poem in the
glow of a night-table lamp The piano music is still heard

LEE (VO)

(reading)
your slightest look easily will
unclose me
though I have closed myself as
fingers
you open always petal by petal
myself

As Lee continues to read aloud the movie cuts to Elliots
darkened den lit by a light in the hallway Elliot enters
wearing a robe crossing the room in the dark

LEE (VO)
(continuing reading)

las Spring opens
touching skillfully mysteriously
her first rose
i do not know what it is about you
that closes and opens
only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper
than
all roses

Elliot turns on a light The camera stays on his face as he
looks off into the distance mouthing indistinctly the line
of poetry Lee next reads

LEE (VO)
(continuing reading)
nobody not even the rain has
such small hands

The film leaves Elliots face and cuts back to the loft
where Lee having finished the poem sits up in the bed
staring pensively lost in her thoughts

CUT TO
The anxiety of the man in the booth
Upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to
The facade of Mount Sinai Hospital It is day A few cars
whiz by as the film moves inside to various scenes depicting

Mickeys comprehensive exam

First is a hearing test and the movie cuts to a darkened
hearing-test room A light goes on revealing a slouched-
over Mickey sitting in a glass booth He is wearing a set

of headphones The camera moves back revealing a technician
at the console on the other side of the booth Mickey
signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset
The jazz continues

Next is an electronystagmography (ENG) Graph paper rolls
out of a machine and after a brief glimpse of the rolling
paper the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified
without his glasses on a couch with electrodes stuck all
over his head

The film then cuts to a BSER test room where Mickey
sitting in a corner chair wears another set of headphones
An electrode is attached to his forehead a nearby technician
sits at a computer video screen looking at a monitoring
graph

Last but not least is the tomography Over the shoulders of
a technician in a booth a large window displays a huge
white rotating machine It makes a whooshing noise as it
turns The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to
reveal Mickey once again lying down this time on a table
his eyes closed underneath it

CUT TO
INT DR GREYS OFFICE - DAY

A sitting Dr Grey his back to the camera is examining a
group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk

DR GREY
I wasnt too happy with the results
of your ENG or your BSER either

The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey
sitting on the other side of his desk

DR GREY
Uh which is why I sent you to
Tomography which was all that
stuff you saw rolling around
(pointing to a spot
on one of the X-rays)
You see this little gray area here

Mickey stares at the X-ray horrified

DR GREY
That gray areas what I had hoped
that we wouldnt run into Id
like you to come in Monday morning
for uh a CAT scan

MICKEY
(reacting)
A brain scan

DR GREY
(gesturing)
Mr Sachs lets take one step ata
time We wont make any decisions

until we have all the information
in front of us all right

CUT TO
EXT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY

Mickey is seen leaving the hospital He strides slowly his
shoulders slouched his hands in his pockets

His voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street
continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side
Occasional traffic goes by

MICKEY (VO)
Okaytake it easy He didnt say
you had anything He just doesnt
like the spot on your X-ray thats

all It doesnt mean you have
anything Dont jump to conclusions
(sighing)

Nothings gonna happen to you
Youre in the middle of New York
City This is your town Youre
surrounded by people and traffic
and restaurants

Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty
look Mickey is so dazed he doesnt even notice

MICKEY (VO)
I mean God how can you how can
you just one dayvanish Keep
calm Youre gonna be okay Dont
panic

CUT TO
INT MICKEYS APARTMENTBEDROOM LOFT - NIGHT

The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey lying in his
bed wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp
MICKEY (VO)

Im dying Im dying I know it
Theres a spot on my lungs

(sitting up putting

on his glasses)
All right now take it easy will
you Its not on your lungs Its
on your ear No its the same
thing isnt it

(pulling the sheets

off and sitting on

the edge of his bed)
Oh jeez I cant sleep Oh God
theres a tumor in my head the size
of a basketball

(putting on his slippers)
N-now I keep thinking I can feel it
every time I blink Oh Jesus
He-he-he wants me to do a brain
scan to confirm what he already
suspects

Mickey still ruminating stands up Fixing his pants he
walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway

MICKEY (VO)

(running his hand

along a banister)
LookIll make a deal with God
Let it just be my ear okay Ill
go deaf Ill go deaf and blind in
one eye maybe But I dont want a
brain operation Once they go into
my skull Il1-Ill wind up like
the guy with the with the wool cap
who delivers for the florist

He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room

MICKEY (VO)

Oh relax will ya Your whole
life you run to doctors The news
is always fine

(pausing at the

bottom of the stairs)
Thats not true What about years
ago

The film cuts to a flashback of Mickeys past Dr Smith
sitting behind his desk faces the camera Rows of
periodicals line the wall behind him
DR SMITH
(gesturing with one hand)
Im sorry to say Mr Sachs that
you cannot have children

The camera moves to Dr Smiths point of view Hannah and
Mickey sitting on the opposite side of the desk They look
stunned

MICKEY
(reacting putting
his hands across his chest)
Gee

HANNAH
(reacting)
Is there no chance

DR SMITH

(getting up from his desk)
Well naturally this doesnt mean
that you cant have a normal sex
life

(walking over to the

opened office door

and closing it)
But Mr Sachss tests indicate that
he is infertile Small sperm
volume and infertile

The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah
following Dr Smith with their eyes

MICKEY
(gesturing looking
up at an offscreen Dr
Smith)
Isnt there anything I can do
Push-ups or hormones

DR SMITH
(offscreen)
Im afraid not

MICKEY
Well I gotta get a second opinion

HANNAH
(turning to Mickey)
This is the second opinion

MICKEY
(shrugging)
Well then a third opinion

Dr Smith walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind
the desk and sits down As he talks the camera moves
closer and closer to his face

DR SMITH
I realize this is a blow My
experience is that many very fine
marriages become unstable and are
destroyed by an inability to deal
with this sort of problem I hope
you wont make too much of it One
can adopt children and there are
various artificial methods of
fertilization

CUT TO
EXT GROVE STREET IN GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk oblivious of the
passing pedestrians Hannah crying blows her nose

MICKEY
(gesturing)
Im so humiliated I dont know
what to say I mean--

HANNAH
(interrupting wiping
her eyes with her tissue)

Could you have ruined yourself
somehow

MICKEY
(gesturing)
How could I ruin myself What do
you mean ruin myself

HANNAH
(overlapping looking
at Mickey)

I dont know Excessive
masturbation

MICKEY

Hey you gonna start knocking my
hobbies Jesus

Hannah sobs clutching her tissue to her face
MICKEY
Maybe maybe we can adopt a child
He said you could adopt one--

HANNAH
(interrupting)
Well what about artificial
insemination
MICKEY
(gesturing)

What are you talking about

HANNAH
(overlapping)
You know where I-I-I would get
implanted from a-a donor

MICKEY
(reacting)
What by a st-stranger

Deep in conversation they cross a tree-lined street They
pass a yellow wood-frame house bordered by a wrought-iron
fence

HANNAH
Yeah they have these banks you
know where they keep them frozen

MICKEY
(gesturing)
Fro-- You want a-a defrosted kid
Is that your idea

HANNAH

MICKEY
With a with a stranger With a--

HANNAH
(interrupting sniffing)
Just think about it Thats all I

They walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickeys
living room The room is brightly lit its cluttered with
pillows and plants Norman and Carol his wife sit on the
couch drinking coffee

CAROL
(putting down her cup)
Oh that was a wonderful show I
think thats the best show you two
ever wrote

NORMAN
(holding his cup
pointing emphatically)
No the funniest show that Mickey
and I ever did was the one we won
the Emmy for

Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room holding
a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate The sun
pours through the windows he passes Hannah is briefly seen
in the background preparing more coffee in the kitchen

MICKEY
YeahI-I think as I think as far
as laughs I mean just plain
laughs you know that was probably
the best thing that we ever did

Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table which is
already crowded with assorted plants plates and a bamboo
tray holding utensils and napkins

NORMAN
(agreeing)
Mm-hm

CAROL

(overlapping her

hands over her

crossed knees and nodding)
Yeah it was funny it was very
funny But the show was about the
two Frenchmen now that was funny
and it was warm

Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch He rubs
his forehead

NORMAN
(to Carol gesturing
with his cup)
We got that idea on that trip to
Paris

CAROL
(nodding)
Right
NORMAN
(smiling)
Hmm

CAROL
(to the offscreen Hannah)
Do you remember that summer in
France Hannah you had jet lag
for six straight weeks

Norman chuckles

MICKEY
(sighing almost mumbling)
Yeah but it was you know I guess
we had fun when we were there and
you know its just I--

NORMAN
(overlapping nodding)
Mm-hm

Hannah walks over to the group holding a pot of coffee
She awkwardly steps past Mickey to pour coffee for Norman
and Carol

HANNAH
(to Mickey)
Sorry
(to Norman and Carol)
Coffee Listen you guys we
were-- You want some more

NORMAN
(holding out his cup)

HANNAH
(refilling Normans cup)
We-wewe had something we-we
really wanted to discuss with you

MICKEY
(overlapping coughing)
Yeah

Hannah refills Carols cup She puts the pot down on the
coffee table and sits down next to Mickey

MICKEY
(standing up and gesturing)
Jeez this is this is this is
very delicate and-and I only bring
this up amongst friends you know

He starts to pace Hannah her hands clasped near her face
glances briefly at Carol

MICKEY
(turning to the group
as he paces behind
the couch)
I mean
(grunting)
this is uh this should not go
any further than this room

NORMAN
(sipping his coffee)
Im all ears

Hannah sighs Mickey pauses for a moment collecting his
thoughts

MICKEY
(gesturing and pacing)
Hannah and Icant have any

children Now I-I-I dont want to

get into whose fault it--
(gesturing)

Its my fault that we cant and-

and-and the details are too

embarrassing to--

HANNAH
(interrupting
nervously picking at
her fingers)
W-w-we-weve decided after a lot of
discussion that we-wed try with
artificial insemination

Mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group
MICKEY
(putting his hands on
his hips)
Yeah Im not so sure that I that
I like that idea myself anyway--

He starts to pace behind the couch anew

HANNAH
(overlapping)
Um I-I didnt really want to you
know go to a sperm bank or
something have some anonymous
donor

(gesturing at Norman

and Carol)
I-I just you know I-I-I wouldnt
want that

MICKEY
(pacing)
Right We felt that if we were
gonna do it that we would like
somebody who we knew and who we
liked and who was warm and bright
and

Norman and Carol remain silent

HANNAH

And you can say no you know
Feel free to say no W-we realize
it has all kinds of implications

Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman

MICKEY
Yeah but the-the point that uh
that were making here is that we
need some sperm

Mickey rubbing his hands on his knees leans back against
the wall Norman and Carol turn to each other reacting

NORMAN
(sighing)
Gee
(chuckling)
Well My first reaction after the

initial shock is uh flattered
that you would ask me
(chuckling nervously)

Carol glances at Norman

MICKEY
(pointing at himself)
Yeah well I would be the father

into a little cup

NORMAN
(shrugging)

HANNAH
(scooting closer to
Carol and Norman on
the couch gesturing)
Obviously we wou-wouldnt have
intercourse

She chuckles nervously

CAROL
(to Hannah chuckling
nervously briefly)

(putting her hand on
Carols shoulder)

(rubbing her hands)
Now lets move on to another topic

Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange
glances reacting

The flashback ends Mickey is back in the present in his
darkened living room illuminated by a glow from a window
behind the couch A coffee table sits in front of the couch
Papers are scattered on the floor Mickey gets up from the
couch where hed been sitting He paces back and forth as
he talks over the screen

MICKEY (VO)

So you had my ex-partners baby
Twins Maybe that did cause some
trouble but

(sighing)
I think we were drifting apart
anyhow Now instead of man and
wife were just good friends Boy
love is really unpredictable

INT METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Manon Lescaut is being performed Onstage the soprano in
the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the
ruins of a wagon The background is dark The film moves
up to the private boxes in the upper loge David and Holly
can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes
David glances at her he reaches down for a bottle of wine
The movie briefly cuts back to the stage The soprano is
leaning on a wagon wheel her voice soars Then its back
to a closer look at Holly and David in their box The aria
continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass He
uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses
Holly mouths a thank you glancing around They look at
each other and raise their glasses in a toast

CUT TO
Dusty bought this huge house in Southampton

The opera audience is heard cheering applauding and
sounding their Bravos

The clapping stops as the movie cuts to Fredericks loft

It is day Lee wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans has
opened the door for Elliot and his client wealthy rock star
Dusty Frye

ELLIOT
(leading the way into
the loft gesturing)
Lee Fredericksay hello to Dusty
Frye

Lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to Dusty

LEE
(shaking Dustys hand)
Hi Dusty
DUSTY

Lee chuckles as she looks at him he is wearing sunglasses
a red-imprinted T-shirt and a baggy coat She turns and
walks with Frederick Elliot and Dusty farther into the
loft her hands clasped behind her back

ELLIOT
(as he walks)
Dustys just bought a huge house in
Southampton and hes in the process
of decorating it

DUSTY
Yeah Its kind of a weird place

(chuckling)
Oh

They walk into the living room area of the loft where
Frederick his hands in his pockets neatly attired in vest
sweater and white shirt stands waiting

DUSTY

(to Frederick giving

him a hip handshake)

ELLIOT
(to a less than
enthusiastic Frederick)

hes very excited

DUSTY

crosses his arms on

Frederick covers his face to hide his disgust

LEE
(chuckling her arms crossed)
Are you excited about becoming a

collector
DUSTY

LEE
(nodding)

DUSTY
(shrugging)

I got a lot more to learn though

FREDERICK
(addressing but not
looking at Dusty)
Do you appreciate drawings

DUSTY
(shrugging)

notices and points to
some offscreen
drawings Frederick
has set up)
Oh Hey Wow
(pointing to an
offscreen nude drawing)
Shes beautiful But uh really
I-I-I-I need something Im
looking for something big

As Dusty talks the camera follows Elliot who walks past
the others to examine the drawings more closely Two framed
nude drawings of Lee are propped up on an easel Elliot
glances admiringly at the drawings then surreptitiously at
Lee admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen
Dusty and Frederick

LEE
(looking at an
offscreen Frederick gesturing)
Big Frederick show him the oils

FREDERICK
(offscreen)
Theyre in the basement

The camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as
she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the
door Frederick follows at a distance

LEE
(to Dusty)

series that Im sure you would
really love

DUSTY
(overlapping muttering)
Well areare they big

LEE

DUSTY
Cause I got a lot of wall space

(chuckling)
FREDERICK

(angrily stopping in
his tracks)
I dont sell my work by the yard

LEE
(chuckling reacting)
Oh Frederick

The camera now moves back to Elliot still staring at the
nude drawings as the sounds of Fredericks and Dustys
footsteps are heard leaving the loft He turns and
hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee

ELLIOT
(chuckling softly)
Hows everything

LEE
(walking onscreen
towards Elliot)
Oh you knowI talked to Hannah
this morning on the phone and she
said that you two might be going to
the country for the weekend

ELLIOT
Yeah she loves to go out in the
woods

LEE
(nodding her arms
clasped around her chest)
Oh yeah

ELLIOT
(chuckling)
But I go nuts Its a conflict

He laughs Lee uneasy looks down

LEE
I have to get my teeth cleaned this
week

ELLIOT
Oh thats nice

Theres an awkward moment of silence

ELLIOT
(breaking the silence
pointing in the
direction of the door)
I figured Id get uh Frederick
and Dusty together

LEE
(looking in the same
direction gesturing)
Oh yeah thats really nice of you

ELLIOT
Yes This kid hes earned a
trillion dollars

LEE
(nodding wrapping
her arms around her
chest again)
Oh

ELLIOT
Hes got like six gold records

LEE
(gesturing relieved
that shes found
something to say)
Oh speaking of recordsI bought
that Mozart Trio you recommended

The camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo
unit pulling a record off the shelf

LEE
(continuing)
and the man in the record shop
showed me another one that I think
youd love Its a another
Bach second movement

She pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the
turntable
ELLIOT
(offscreen)
Oh you-you have that one

LEE
(working at the
stereo turning her
head towards Elliot)
Yeah

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
Oh I would love to hear it

Bachs Concerto for Harpsichord fills the room

LEE
(putting the turntable
cover in place)
Oh and Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera An architect

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
Oh thats nice Id love to see
her wind up settled Shes a tense
one
(chuckling)

The record in place Lee turns and leans back against the
stereo unit She listens to the music her eyes closed

The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room as
Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her

LEE
(intently)
Isnt that beautiful

ELLIOT
(looking at Lee his
hands clasped in
front of him)
I know this Bach F Minor
Concerto Its one of my favorites

Lee smiling continues to listen to the music her head
down Elliot stares at her

ELLIOT
(after a pause)
Uhdid you ever get around to ee
cummings

LEE
(wrapping her arms
around her chest and
looking away from
Elliot for a moment)
Yes hes just adorable

Elliot nods

LEE
(awkwardly)

lientele you know where I get my
eeth cleaned andall the
ygienists now wear gloves because
heyre afraid of AIDS

aortcay

ELLIOT
(taking a breath)
Oh right

There is another moment of silence Elliot stares at Lee
who continues to look down her arms around her chest The
harpsichord plays on

ELLIOT
(softly)
Did you ever get around to the poem
on page a hundred and twelve

LEE
Yes it made me cry
(tentatively looking
at Elliot)
it was so beautifulso romantic

Lee looks down again the music plays softly and Elliot
continues to stare at her thinking

ELLIOT (V0O)
I want so badly to kiss her Not
here you idiot Youve got to get
her alone someplace

As Elliots thoughts are heard over the scene Lee glances
around the loft then begins to walk away The camera
follows her as she goes past the nude drawings which become
the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen

ELLIOT (VO)
But Ive got to proceed cautiously
This is a very delicate situation
Okay uhask her if you can see

her for lunch or a drink tomorrow

Lee walks back onscreen to the bookshelf behind the drawings
She takes the ee cummings book from the shelf and flips
through it as she walks back to Elliot who is still leaning
by the stereo still ruminating

ELLIOT (V0O)
And be ready to make light of the
offer if shes unresponsive This
has to be done very skillfully
very diplomatically

LEE
(showing Elliot a
poem in her book)
Did you ever read this one--

Elliot leaps up grabs Lee and kisses her passionately
Lee surprised pushes him away

LEE
Elliot Dont

ELLIOT
Lee Lee Lee Im in love with
you

He kisses Lee again He clumsily turns around she humps
against the stereo unit As Lee pulls away she smashes
into the turntable The needle scratches loudly Lee
shocked is gasping The record pushed to a different part
of the concerto now plays a more complicated faster fugue

ELLIOT
(breathing hard)
on

LEE
(gasping)
What are you doing

ELLIOT
(frantically)
IIm-Im-Im-Im sorry I have
to talk to you for Theres so

much that I want to tell you

Lee stares at Elliot in shock
LEE
(still gasping)
Elliot

ELLIOT
(gesturing desperately)
I have been in love with you for so
long

Frederick and Dustys indistinct voices raised in argument
are suddenly heard Elliot quickly turns away from Lee

She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft
entranceway Frederick enters the loft first followed by a
confused Dusty They stride across the loft past Lee who
is standing by the stereo Elliot standing near the nude
drawings is looking through a book

FREDERICK
(angrily)
Please forget it I dont have any
interest in selling anything

DUSTY
(gesturing)
I ask you if you have something
with a little puce in it you gotta
fly off the handle

LEE
(in a slightly
higher-pitched voice)
Whats the problem

FREDERICK
(pulling the nude
drawings off his
easel angrily)
Im not interested in what your
interior decorator would think
okay

DUSTY
(overlapping gesturing)
Well I cant commit to anything
without consulting her first
Thats what I have her for okay

FREDERICK
(carrying the drawings
off)
This is degrading You dont buy
paintings to blend in with the sofa

DUSTY
(looking after Frederick)
Its not a sofa its an ottoman
(touching his
forehead turning to Elliot)
God forget it Lets just get
outta here Elliot

ELLIOT
(putting down the book)
Well go

The film moves outside the loft building Dusty and Elliot
emerge and walk to Dustys waiting limousine Elliot is
rubbing his forehead anguished

DUSTY
(angrily getting
into the car)
What a weirdo that guy is Paranoid
(noticing Elliots
anguished face)
Whats the matter with you

ELLIOT
(gesturing)
Look I-I-Ill be okay I11 be okay

Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door
Elliot leans down to the chauffeurs window signaling for
him to start driving
ELLIOT
(continuing gesturing)
You go Go on Go

The limousine drives off Elliot runs to a phone booth
across the street He picks up the phone and dials

The film cuts to Frederick in his loft standing near the
phone It rings Frederick picks it up

FREDERICK
(into the telephone)
Hello Hello Hello

When no one answers Frederick reacting hangs up and the
film moves back outside to the phone booth where Elliot
the phone receiver to his ear listens for a moment then
hangs up He walks out of the booth reacting then walks
down the sidewalk where he bumps into a frantic Lee just
turning the corner

LEE
(gesturing in relief)
Oh There you are

Elliot mumbles relieved and confused

LEE
I was looking for you

ELLIOT
(gesturing)
I I must apologize I-Im I-Im

LEE
(gesturing)
Well how do you expect me to react

Elliot uneasy glances up in the direction of Fredericks
loft He leads Lee a few yards up the street away from any

prying eyes

ELLIOT
(taking Lees arm)
Wh-- uh I know I know but I am

in love with you

LEE

(overlapping shaking
his head)

hair shaking her
head hopelessly)

Evan his back to the camera walks to the front door and
opens it to Hannah

HANNAH

Hi Hows she doing

EVAN

Hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her
aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen He
passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed
photographs

EVAN
Shes in the kitchen there Its
the same thing Same thing She
promises promises
(gesturing)
But its all lies

Through a doorway Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in
the kitchen She wears a robe over a slip and stockings
shes drinking Evan stands in the doorway looking at her
he doesnt go in

HANNAH
(offscreen patiently)
Dont make it worse Dad

Hannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen
her mother takes a sip of her drink

HANNAH
Hi Mom How you doing Here let

(taking away her
mothers drink to Evan)
What triggered it

EVAN
(gesturing as Norma

turns her head and

watches him)
We were making a commercial down at
the mayors office and there was
this young good-looking salesman

Norma reacts turning to her daughter Hannah however has
her back turned She is busy taking charge in the kitchen
as Evan speaks She takes some pills out of a cupboard and
hands them to her mother with a glass of water

EVAN
(continuing)
and your mother was throwing
herself at him in a disgusting way
and when she found she was too old
to seduce him that he was just
embarrassed by her--

NORMA
(angrily interrupting
turning her head)
Liar Liar

The camera moves to Evan who continues to tell his story
ignoring his wifes outburst as he walks away from the
kitchen doorway into the den

EVAN
Then at lunch she got drunker and
drunker
(shouting over his shoulder)
and finally she became Joan Collins

Evan walks over to the piano where several framed family
photographs sit in a line on its top He picks one up as
Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen

NORMA
(offscreen)
All my life Ive had to put up with
insults
The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks She is

still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood
moments before She holds the water glass and the pills
NORMA
(continuing dramatically)
from this non-person this th-
th-this haircut that passes for a
man
(turning to look at
the offscreen Hannah)

He could never support us Its a
good thing we had a talented
daughter

Evan is back in the doorway listening to Norma getting
more and more angry As he makes a retort he starts to
walk back to the den and his piano

EVAN
I can only hope that she was mine
With you as her mother
(gesturing his voice
getting louder)
her father could be anybody in
Actors Equity

NORMA
Shes talentedso its not likely
shes yours
(taking a sip of water)

HANNAH

(walking over to the

doorway to speak to

Evan whos already

fuming in the den)
Dad could you just please stay in
the other room and let me take care
of her

Hannah goes back to Norma she takes the glass of water away

EVAN
(offscreen choosing
to ignore Hannahs suggestion)
You never know when shes going to
fall off the wagon and humiliate
everybody

Hannah choosing to ignore Evans remark hands her mother a
cup of coffee she puts her mothers hands on the cup

HANNAH
Here Mom Drink this
(leaning against a
kitchen counter)
You know youre awful You
probably were flirting
NORMA
(sipping her coffee)
No I like to joke around and have
fun and he gets angry because I
get the attention Hes gotten
sourer as hes gotten older and
Ive tried to stay youngat heart

HANNAH
You promised to stay on the wagon

NORMA

(shaking her head)
The sacrifices Ive made because of
that man

(inhaling)
Hes ruined me with his ego his
philandering his--

(gesturing)
his-his-his-his mediocrity

HANNAH
Okay stop being so dramatic

NORMA
(shouting to the
offscreen Evan)
Hes the one thats made every

there and hed flounder around with
his expensive haircuts and hairdos
and clothes Hes all show
(touching Hannahs
arm again then
touching her chest)
Now how can you act when theres
nothing inside to come out

Norma sips her coffee softly sobbing Hannah reacting
walks away from the counter and capping the bottle of
pills puts them back in the cupboard Evan plays the piano
offscreen The camera moves in on Hannahs face as she
reflects her voice heard over the screen

HANNAH (VO)
She was so beautiful at one time
and he was so dashing Both of
them just full of promise and hopes
that never materialized

The camera leaves Hannahs face as she continues to reflect
it moves to the den to the row of family photos on the
piano one of a present-day Evan and Norma others where
both Norma and Evan are young beautiful hopeful The
music plays on

HANNAH (VO)
And the fights and the constant
infidelities to prove
themselvesand blaming each other
Its s-sad They loved the idea of
having us kids but raising us
didnt interest them much But
its impossible to hold it against
them They didnt know anything
else

The film cuts back to the kitchen Norma stands up Hannah
takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter

NORMA
You know of all of us in the
family you were the one blessed
with the true gift

She puts her arm around Hannahs shoulder Mother and
daughter walk out of the kitchen

HANNAH
(holding the hand her
mother had placed on
her shoulder)
Ohhh my true gift is luck Mom

Norma chuckles

HANNAH
(overlapping)
I just had a lot of luckfrom my
first show you know Ive always
thought Lee was the one destined
for great things

NORMA
Yes shes lovely but she doesnt
have your spark
(gesturing and chuckling)
She knows it She worships you
She wouldnt dare get up there on
the stage

HANNAH
(looking at her mother)
Now Hollys not shy

They stop at the entrance to the den Evan can be seen
playing the piano as they continue their conversation

NORMA
No Hollys game for anything
Holly takes after me

HANNAH
True

NORMA
(shaking her head)
Id have been a great dope addict

Norma chortles Hannah laughs touching her mother They
walk over to Evan at the piano

EVAN
(looking up)
Remember this Hannah

Evan plays a few bars of You Are Too Beautiful as mother
and daughter their backs to the camera listen Norma
leans over the piano Hannah looks off into the distance
deep in reflection The piano music continues in the
background as the movie cuts to

cut To

The entrance to the St Regis Hotel elegant and warmly lit
in the night Pedestrians pass Baroque harpsichord music
plays over the scene The camera moves up the hotels
facade past its welcoming flags to its ornate windows
several floors up

As the harpsichord continues to play the film moves inside
to one of the hotel rooms Elliot his back to the camera
is opening the door to Lee

Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters They stand
very close to each other framed by the door and a stark

subtly striped wallpapered wall

ELLIOT
(looking intensely at
Lee his hands in his pockets)
I thought you werent coming

LEE
I almost didnt

ELLIOT
(putting his hand on
her shoulder wanting
to kiss her)
Lee uh

LEE
I didnt sleep all night

ELLIOT
(taking his hand
away gesturing to
the room)
No no-no-no Im sure

They walk towards the camera further into the room Elliot
puts his arm around Lee

LEE
What are we doing meeting ina
hotel room Its terrible isnt it

The music stops The camera follows Lee as she walks
towards the curtained windows past a fireplace a mirror
some innocuous pictures a delicate table holding a lamp
the foot of the bed

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
I-I couldnt think where to invite
you without taking risks

LEE
I promised myself I wouldnt let
this happen till you were living
alone I was so torn when you
called

She parts a corner of the curtains looking out the window
turning when Elliot speaks

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
Ive wanted to call you everyday
since I first told you how I felt
He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows

ELLIOT
I resisted so many times
(pausing)
Dont think badly of me

He takes Lee into his arms

ELLIOT
This is not an easy situation

LEE
(whispering)
I know it isnt

They kiss their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow
of the room Elliot takes Lees coat off without breaking
the kiss They embrace They kiss each other lightly then
stronger more passionately their embrace much tighter

And its later that night The harpsichord music begins to
play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal
Lee lying contentedly under the sheets her hair fanned out
on the pillows one arm near her head

LEE

That was just perfect Youve
ruined me for anyone else

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
I dont want anyone else ever to
have you
LEE
(sighing)

I was so worried I wouldnt compare
with Hannah

ELLIOT
(offscreen laughing)
Oh my God

He enters the screen sitting down on the edge of the bed
next to Lee He holds a cigarette

ELLIOT
You really do have those thoughts
dont you
LEE
(chuckling touching
Elliots arm)
Oh all the time

Elliot chuckles they hold hands

LEE
I know she must be a really
passionate person

ELLIOT

(looking at their

clasped hands)
Yes shes shes very warm but
but it-its me that wants to be
giving to you I-I-I want to do
things for you Hannah doesnt
need me as much

(chuckling as Lee laughs)
Im being presumptuous Not that
you need me

LEE
(nodding)
I want you to take care of me
And I love when you do things to me

Elliot leans down to Lee they begin to kiss passionately

EXT STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICKS LOFT - NIGHT

Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain shes bareheaded
The streets are dark A car drives by a pedestrian passes
holding an umbrella Lee passes a restaurant well lit
inside by hanging lamps The baroque music continues as she
enters the loft her head soaked She closes the door
touching her soaking hair

FREDERICK
(offscreen)
Youre late

Lee walks through the lofts living room area unbelting her
coat towards the bathroom She passes Frederick who sits
at a table in the kitchen area drinking a cup of coffee and
reading the paper A plate with a half-eaten sandwich sits
in front of him The music stops

LEE
(opening the bathroom door)
Lucy and I kept talking and I
didnt realize how late it had
gotten

FREDERICK

(barely glancing up

from his paper)
You missed a very dull TV show
about Auschwitz More gruesome
film clipsand more puzzled
intellectuals declaring their
mystification over the systematic
murder of millions

As he talks Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light She
takes off her coat hanging it on a hook then begins to dry
her hair with a towel

FREDERICK

(turning his head

slightly in Lees

direction and gesturing)
The reason why they could never
answer the question How could it
possibly happen is that its the
wrong question Given what people
are the question is

(swallowing)
Why doesnt it happen more often
Of course it does in subtler forms

Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of
coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom tossing the towel
down on the counter

LEE
(moving her fingers
through her wet hair)
I have a little headache from this
weather

She takes a kettle and fills it with water

FREDERICK
(grunting sipping
his coffee)
Its been ages since I sat in front
of the TV just changing channels
to find something

As Frederick continues his monologue Lee is busy in the
background striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on
the stove for the kettle taking a glass out of the cupboard
walking into the bathroom for some pills filling the glass

with water in the kitchen sink and taking her pills

FREDERICK

You see the whole cultureNazis
deodorant salesman
wrestlersbeauty contests the
talk show Can you imagine the
level of a mind that watches
wrestling

(gesturing)
Hmm But the worst are the
fundamentalist preachersthird-
rate con men telling the poor
suckers that watch them that they
speak for Jesusand to please
send in money

(picking up his sandwich)
Money money money If Jesus came
back and saw whats going on in
his name hed never stop throwing
up

He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee Lee
sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the

bedroom area

She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed

takes off his glasses He turns and looks at Lee in surprise

LEE

(impatiently her

hands in her hair)
Oh God Frederick could you
please lighten up Im really not
in the mood to hear a review of
contemporary society again

Frederick

FREDERICK
(standing up from the table)
You know youve been very nervous
lately

LEE
(sighing)
I cant take this anymore

FREDERICK
(walking over to the bed)
Im just trying to complete an
education I started on you five
years ago

LEE
(unbuttoning her blouse)
Im not your pupil
(sighing her hands
at her side)
I was but Im not

FREDERICK
(sitting down on the
edge of the bed)
When you leave the nest I just
want you to be ready to face the
real world

He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed

LEE
(putting her hand on
Fredericks leg)
Frederick were going to have to
make some changes

She sighs

FREDERICK
(quickly looking at
Lee alarmed)
Like what

LEE
Oh you know what Im suffocating

FREDERICK
(turning away his
hands clasped in
front of him)
Oh Are we going to have this
conversation again

LEE
Yes were going to have this
conversation again II have to

leave I have to move out

FREDERICK
(shaking his clasped
hands intensely)
Why
LEE
(sighing)
Because I have to

FREDERICK
(emotionally)
What are you going to use for money

LEE
I dont know I thought maybe Id
move in with my parents for a while

FREDERICK
Tch oh I always told you you
would leave me
(looking at Lee)
Butdoes it have to be now

LEE
(hugging her arm with
her other hand)
Well maybe itll only be temporary
but I ha--I have to try

FREDERICK

(taking Lees head in

his hands and looking

at her)
OhLee you are my whole world

(pausing)
Good God Have you been kissed
tonight

LEE
(reacting pushing
Fredericks hands
from her face)
No

FREDERICK
(reacting)
Oh yes you have

LEE
(quickly standing up defensively)
No

FREDERICK
(raising his voice)

Youve been with someone

LEE
(overlapping running
away from the bed)
Stop accusing me

Lee runs into the kitchen her hands tight around her chest

FREDERICK
(offscreen)
Im too smart Lee You cant fool
me Youre turning all red

Lee fraught with emotion briefly puts her outstretched
hands on the refrigerator door then turns around and leans
against it hugging herself her blouse still unbuttoned
her hair still wet and bedraggled

LEE
Leave me alone

Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the
counter

FREDERICK
(angrily)
Oh Christ Whats wrong with you

LEE
(leaning against the
refrigerator sighing)
Im sorry

FREDERICK
Oh couldnt you say something
You have to slither around behind
my back

LEE
(overlapping her
voice emotionally raised)
Im saying it now

FREDERICK
So you met somebody else

LEE
(sighing nodding)
Yeah

Frederick cringes reacting He puts his hand to his
forehead he sighs
(walking into the bathroom)
But you God you knew that was
going to happen sooner or later I
cant live like this

FREDERICK
(turning to face Lee
in the bathroom his
arms crossed)
Who is it

LEE
(frantically putting
things in her purse
glaring at Frederick)
Whats the difference Its just
somebody I met

FREDERICK
But who Where did you meet him

LEE
It doesnt make a difference I
have to move out

FREDERICK
You are you are my only connection
to the world

Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway

LEE

(gesturing emotionally)
Oh God thats too much
responsibility for me Its not
fair I want a less complicated
life Frederick I want a husband
maybe even a child before its too
late

FREDERICK
(reacting his face
in his hand)
JesusJdesus

LEE
(gesturing moving
closer to Frederick)
Oh God I dont even know what I
want

FREDERICK
(sighing heavily reacting)
Oh

LEE

(rubbing Fredericks

shoulder tenderly)
Tch oh what do you get out of me
anyway I mean

(laying her head

against his shoulder

sighing deeply)
its not sexual anymore Its
certainly not intellectual I
mean youre so superior to me in
every way that--

Frederick furiously shakes Lee away He pounds his fist
against a cupboard Lee gasping moves away

FREDERICK
Please dont patronize me

He puts his hand on his forehead then turns to the offscreen
Lee

FREDERICK
God I should have married you
years ago when you wanted to I
should have agreed

He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen

LEE
(sighing)
Oh God dont you know it never
would have worked

Frederick turns away from Lee He begins to pace near the
counter

FREDERICK
I told you one day you would leave
me
(leaning on the counter)
for a younger man I--

He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and
frustration then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow

INT HANNAHS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Hannah wearing a plaid shirt sits up in bed a book
propped up on her knees A cupboard with some bric-a-brac
is mounted behind the night table which holds a small
white warm-glowing lamp and some photographs She turns
the page as Elliot in pajamas and silk bathrobe enters
She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge
of the bed and muses His voice is heard over the screen

ELLIOT (V0O)

What passion today with Lee Shes
a volcano It was a totally
fulfilling experience Just as I
dreamed it would be

(nodding slightly as

he takes off his slippers)
Thats what it was It was like
living out a dreama great dream

(taking off his bathrobe)
Now I feel very good and cozy being
here next to Hannah Theres
something very lovely and real
about Hannah

(tossing his bathrobe

aside and lying down

on the bed next to

Hannah his hands

crossed over his stomach)
She gives me a very deep feeling of
being part of something Shes a
wonderful womanand I betrayed
her She came into my empty life
and changed itand I paid her
back by banging her sister ina
hotel room God Im despicable
What a cruel and shallow thing to
do

(sitting up)
I have to call her now and tell her
what we did was crazy

(anxiously)
It cant ever happen again Im

Hannah too much I love my wife

Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room

What if he answers
(turning into the
doorway leading to
the living room)

(walking into the
darkened living room)
Ill tell her we cant communicate

(whispering)
Its immoral

Elliot switches on the light He paces back and forth in
front of the piano and an accompanying music stand The top
of the piano is filled with family photos the lamp he
turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and
the piece of sheet music open on the piano

ELLIOT
(gesturing and whispering)
Then time will pass I wont

little than destroy Hannah

Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch

ELLIOT
(whispering rubbing
his hands)

(putting his hands on

his hips)

offscreen Hannah gasping)

The movie cuts to Lee standing in the dark in Fredericks
loft She talks softly into the telephone

LEE

(into the telephone)
I would have hung up if you hadnt
answered and I promise I wont ever
do this again but I just had to
tell you I feel very close to you

(pausing)
Good night

Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot
standing in his living room Stunned he slowly lowers the
phone receiver

The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life
is meaningless - Tolstoy

Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a
university library the camera focused on a huge replica of
Rodins Thinker before moving to the front entrance Mickey
can be seen emerging from its depths He wears his raincoat
his hands are in his pockets He ponders the scene as he
walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the
sidewalk

Passersby some holding books are seen

MICKEY (VO)
Millions of books written on every
conceivable subject by all these
great minds and and in the end
none of em knows anything more
about the big questions of life
than I do Ss--I read Socrates
You know n-n-n-- this guy used to
kn-knock off little Greek boys
What the hells he got to teach me
And and Nietzsche with his with
his Theory of Eternal Recurrence
He said that the life we live
were gonna live over and over
again the exact same way for
eternity Great That means I
uh Ill have to sit through the
Ice Capades again Tch Its not
worth it

The movie next cuts to a sunny day in Central Park A male
jogger seen through some tree branches runs by The
camera moves past him revealing a pondering Mickey walking

by the reservoir

And

He continues to talk over the screen

MICKEY (VO)

woman jogger in a red
sweatsuit who runs by)

»»Oh Look at this one Poor
thing My God she has to tote all

that

fat around Maybe the poets

answer
Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the
reservoir He stops walking and looks out over the water

MICKEY (VO)
Shh--Of course I was in love with
Hannah That didnt work out too
well
(sighing)
I even took her sister out
Remember that

Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and
the distant skyline A jogger crosses in front of him
Its very quiet the soft jazz continues

MICKEY (VO)
Remember years ago when Hannah and
I got divorced and she fixed me up
with her sister Holly

The film cuts abruptly to Mickeys flashback of his date
with Holly beginning with a rock club performance The
soft jazz becomes loud pulsating rock Three punkers--a
girl with pink hair a girl with a spiked mohawk and a guy
with Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop
their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band The 39
Steps

The camera moves to the stage revealing a sleazy-looking
rock band in the midst of their number

THE 39 STEPS
(singing)
T want to be like you
I said Im going to fit into your
group

As the band loudly plays on the camera moves across the
spellbound audience sitting at crowded smoky small

tables to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly
squeezed together at one of them A nearby member of the
audience swills beer from a bottle Holly beating time to
the music and enjoying herself takes a puff of her cigarette
She wears a wristful of silver bracelets She glances at
Mickey impatiently Hes the only one in the place wearing

a suit

THE 39 STEPS
(singing)
T dont wanna be different
Said Im gonna be just like you
Because Im gonna buy the records
That they play on radio

Holly turns back to the band who are still in full swing
The camera moves down the body of the lead singer singing
into a microphone from his longish curly red hair through
his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso to his guitar He
wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold
bracelets on his upper arm The microphone screeches
feedback

THE 39 STEPS
(singing)

Im gonna dance at clubs
Gonna do just what Im told
Because Im bleedin now
And Im bleedin now
I wanna slip slip slip slip
slip
Into the crowd
I wanna slip slip slip slip
slip
Into the crowd

The camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken-
looking Mickey They are crowded in with people In the
background a waitress holds up a tray A man drinks from a
glass mug people chatter indistinctly over the loud band
The club is noisy smoky and thick with people Holly
glances at Mickey once again this time unable to contain
her annoyance

HOLLY
Oh why are you making those faces

MICKEY
(leaning over to
Holly gesturing)
I cant hear you I cant hear

meltdown I cant hear anything
HOLLY

gesturing dramatically)
Look cant you feel the energy
Its tangible energy The rooms
alive with positive vibrations

She opens a vial of cocaine

MICKEY
(gesturing trying to
talk over the band)

Holly holds a short metal straw of cocaine to her nose and
sniffs it

MICKEY

Hollys shoulder)

While Mickey pleads with her Holly puts her cocaine vial
into her purse She holds a finger against one nostril and

sniffs She then picks up her lit cigarette and continues
to smoke

MICKEY
Can we can we go

HOLLY
(looking at the
offscreen hand
bopping her head to
the music and smoking)

The camera leaves the crowded tables and moves back to the
band The lead singers continues to sing with his band
swaying his body to the music

THE 39 STEPS
(singing)
Gonna buy the records
That they play on the radio

as the film cuts abruptly to outside the rock club The
music has stopped Mickey and Holly almost in dark
silhouette are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk
arguing They pass some lighted clothing store windows a
few cars go by in the dark street

HOLLY
(enthusiastically)
I love songs about extraterrestrial

MICKEY
Not when theyre sung by
extraterrestrials

HOLLY
(impatiently with annoyance)
Oh well I cannot communicate with

They stop briefly at a street corner and look for oncoming
cars before crossing Mickey takes Hollys arm as they walk
across the street towards the camera

CUT TO
The big leap

The film cuts to Father Flynns rectory office The Catholic
priest looks out a simple stained-glass window then turns
to an offscreen Mickey

FATHER FLYNN
(gesturing)
Now why do you think that you would
like to convert to Catholicism

The camera moves back to reveal Mickey his back to the
camera sitting in front of Father Flynns desk A lamp is
lit in the background the Fathers desk is neat The room
is comfortably decorated in wood and leather

MICKEY
Well uh because y-you know I
gotta have something to believe in
otherwise life is just meaningless

FATHER FLYNN
(pacing behind his
desk and gesturing)
I understand But why did you make
the decision to choose the Catholic
faith

The movie cuts to Mickeys face Hes very neat in a tie
sweater and sports jacket

MICKEY
(gesturing)

Tch Well y-you knowfirst of
all because its a very beautiful
religion Its very well structured
Now Im talking now incidentally
about the-the uh against-school-
prayer pro-abortion anti-nuclear

wing
FATHER FLYNN
(offscreen)
So at the moment you dont believe
in God

The camera cuts back to Father Flynn who walks over to a
leather armchair next to a table set for tea He begins to
pour the tea into china cups

MICKEY

(offscreen)
No A-a-and I-I want to You
know Im-Im willing to do anything
Ill you know Ill dye Easter
eggs if it works

(walking over to

Father Flynn and

sitting down in an

adjacent chair)
I-I need some evidence I gotta
have some proof Uh you know i-
i-if I cant believe in God

(gesturing his

raincoat in his lap)
then I dont think life is worth

living

FATHER FLYNN
(stopping his tea pouring)
It means making a very big leap

Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap

MICKEY
(nodding fiddling
with his raincoat)
Yes well can-can you help me

The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickeys
parents apartment

In the foreground a section of the living room can be seen
with a bureau holding a lamp and a framed photo The
hallway itself is crowded with pictures and a wall shelf
At the other end of the hallway in the background is
another bureau with candlesticks on top and a framed
picture on the wall above Mickeys mother stands in the
front of this bureau at the hallways end screaming at the
top of her lungs holding her heart dramatically

MOTHER
(crying)
Why Oh my God

She sobs hysterically staggering offscreen to the bathroom
she shuts the door Mickey walks into view in the living
room looking after his shocked mother who continues to cry
over the scene

MICKEY
(overlapping and gesturing)
I dont understand
(turning to his
offscreen father)
I thought that you would be happy

FATHER
(offscreen)
How can we be happy

His father walks into view carrying a teacup and a candy
dish He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen

MICKEY
(following his father)
Well because I never thought of
God in my life Now Im giving it
serious thought

FATHER
(offscreen in the kitchen)
But Catholicism Why not your own
people

MICKEY
(gesturing at the
kitchen door to his
offscreen father)
Because I got off to a wrong foot
with my own thing you know B-b-
b-but I need a dramatic change in
my life
FATHER
(offscreen)
Youre gonna believe in Jesus Christ

MICKEY
(gesturing)
I know it sounds funny but Im
gonna try

FATHER
(offscreen)
But why We raised you as a Jew

MICKEY
(shrugging)
So just cause I was born that
way You know Im old enough to

make a mature decision

Mickeys father walks into view he stands by the stove near
the kitchen doorway picking up a dirty glass and some bowls
to clean

FATHER
But why Jesus Christ Why for
instance shouldnt you become a
Buddhist

Holding the dirty dishes in his hand Mickeys father looks
at his son

MICKEY
(gesturing)
A Bud-- Thats totally alien to
me Look youre getting on in
years right Arent you afraid of
dying
Mickeys father walks offscreen again to the

FATHER
(offscreen)
Why should I be afraid

MICKEY
(loudly gesturing)
Oh Cause you wont exist

FATHER
(offscreen)
So

MICKEY
(gesturing)
That thought doesnt terrify you

kitchen sink

Mickeys father walks out of the kitchen past his son to

the living room

FATHER
(waving his arm)
Who thinks about such nonsense

Now Im alive When Im dead Ill

be dead

MICKEY
(following his
father gesturing)
I dont understand Arent you
frightened

FATHER
(offscreen)
Of what Ill be unconscious

MICKEY
(turning and walking
down the hallway)
Yeah I know But never to exist
again

FATHER
(offscreen)
How do you know

MICKEY
Well it certainly doesnt look
promising
Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the
hallway He starts to pound it

FATHER
(offscreen)
Who knows whatll be

Mickeys father comes back on screen hes carrying a plate
of hors doeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen
He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey whos now
struggling to open the bathroom door

FATHER
(gesturing with his
hands full)
Ill either be unconscious or I
wont If not Ill deal with it

then Im not gonna worry now
about whats gonna be when Im
unconscious

MICKEY

(pounding on the door)
Mom come out

MOTHER
(offscreen in the bathroom)
Of course theres a God you idiot
You dont believe in God

MICKEY
(sighing)
But if theres a God then wh-why
is there so much evil in the world
(shrugging)
What-- Just on a simplistic level
Why-why were there Nazis

MOTHER
(offscreen in the bathroom)
Tell him Max

Mickey reacting hits his forehead

FATHER
(offscreen)
How the hell do I know why there
were Nazis I dont know how the
can opener works

Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to
A beautiful snow-covered church downtown complete with
courtyard and wrought-iron fence A pedestrian walks by
with an umbrella A church choir sings a soaring hymn over
the scene

The music continues as the film moves inside where the

choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold A
fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film
cuts to the back where Mickey his arms crossed stands
underneath some stained-glass windows watching and listening
to the inspiring music

The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father
Flynn in his office

He picks up some large heavy books from a shelf near his
window and he walks over to Mickey whos standing near his
desk already holding several tomes Father Flynn puts the
books on top of Mickeys pile Mickey flipping through the
top one awkwardly carries his bundle to the door

Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the
cross complete with crown of thorns and holy expression
His eyes especially designed to blink as the lights hit
them open and close repeatedly The hymn plays on loudly
as the camera moves back revealing Mickey standing outside
a barber shop window looking at the Christ playing and
shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes 3-D effect
Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger blinking
Christ A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby
passing traffic is reflected in the window

Mickey turns from the window shrugging and starts to walk
down the street past a fruit and vegetable store with open-
air-displayed flowers past several briskly moving
pedestrians

With the hymn still playing the screen goes black briefly
Mickey opens the door the light from a hallway illuminating
him Hes just entered his apartment He closes the door
and walks through his dark foyer he carries a brown bag

He switches on the light and walking past his spiral
staircase past several framed pictures on the wall he
makes his way to his living room coffee table Mickey pulls
a crucifix out of the bag he looks at it then puts it on
the table near a pile of books and some objets dart He
then takes out a copy of the New Testament putting it on
top of the crucifix Then out comes a framed picture of a
saint It too gets put on the growing pile But the bag is
not yet empty Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and
a large jar of Hellmans mayonnaise Mickey sets them on
top of the saint

CUT TO
Summer in New York

A piano plays Bewitched in the background as the film cuts
to a large tree covered with bright white blossoms The
camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept red-brick
brownstone on a pleasant sunny New York City street A man
wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the
building to Elliots analysts office The psychotherapist
sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window
In front of the window sits a table covered with artifacts
and a large lamp The analysts fingers are touching his
arms resting on the chair as he listens to the offscreen
Elliot

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
I-I cant seem to take action
Im-Im like uh Hamlet unable to
kill his uncle

The music stops as the camera moves across the room to
reveal Elliot sitting in a wooden chair He holds a long
thin cigarette he wears a gold Rolex watch He face is not
yet seen

ELLIOT
(face offscreen)
I want Lee but I cant harm Hannah
And in no other area am Ia
procrastinator

Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag The camera
follows the cigarette up to his face Elliot looks
thoughtful as the movie cuts to

EXT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY
Lee wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books is
running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight greeting
other students as she passes Elliot continues to talk over
the scene

ELLIOT (V0O)
MeanwhileLee has no direction
Shes taking courses at
Columbiabut just randomly

as Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug a
professor who is running over to her calling her name
They mouth hello smiling and begin to walk off together

ELLIOT (V0O)
I try not to call her but then she
calls me and thenI call andwe
try to resist meeting butonce
in a while we meet Sometimes we
argue because I cant break up my
marriage Sometimes we wind up
making love andwe both feel
terrible

The film cuts back to Elliot in his analysts office

ELLIOT
But its my fault

Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette The camera
follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray

ELLIOT
(face offscreen)
For all my education
accomplishments and so-called
wisdomI cant fathom my own heart

EXT CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the
Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park The
camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas
dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers
enjoying the day The leader holding some pamphlets
stands by a chain-link fence a few feet away from his
group talking to someone on the other side Its Mickey
as the camera soon shows wearing a short-sleeved shirt a
paper tucked under his arm
KRISHNA LEADER

fence to Mickey)

material hes just received)
Well okay Thank you very much

KRISHNA LEADER

Mickey walks off the Hare Krishnas still dancing and
singing on the other side of the fence He flips through
the literature as he walks then looks straight ahead
pondering His voice is heard over the screen

MICKEY (VO)
Who are you kidding Youre gonna
be a Krishna Youre gonna shave
your head and put on robes and

Mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears
on a black screen

Autumn chill

Bachs Concerto for Harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to
the waterfront at dusk A bench faces some wharf pilings
the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view
the wind blowing her hair She stands and faces the water
and the distant skyline across the bay The view is
contemplative beautiful in the dim light

Lee is alone her hands are in her pockets Lee thinking

is heard over the scene the harpsichord music plays in the
background

LEE (VO)

The nights are really getting
cooler Summer went so quickly
Soon itll be fall

(walking to the beach

and sitting down)

the water)
Funny I feel like Im betraying
Elliotbut thats ridiculous

The concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly leaning into
an open phone booth near a subway entrance She wears a
football jacket jeans and sneakers she holds a manuscript
in her arms Its a busy corner People rush past Holly
towards the subway others are walking up the station steps
Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah

Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette
She looks off in the distance smiling as the film cuts to

on the corner of the piano A little boy sitting in a chair
next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is
leaning over the arm of the sofa An adult guest talks to
the little boy another guest takes a sip of wine from a
glass shed placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns
and addresses the group

Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play
the piano A nearby woman toasts him with her drink The
camera moves around the room as he plays showing the
various guests chattering over the music Some are in
clusters in private conversations others listen and watch
the offscreen Evan A couple stands by the window one man
gets up from his chair and walks away Some guests sip
their drinks smiling as the camera moves back to the piano
and the book-laden wall Evan is playing the piano with
exuberance Norma still standing behind him has a
poignant wistful expression on her face She mouths the
words to the song Evan is playing It Could Happen to You
The woman next to her smiles enjoying the music as the
camera continues its exploration moving to a man standing
in the doorway with a group of children Mavis the maid
walks by with a tray of hors doeuvres The man takes one
mouthing his thanks as the camera travels past the open
bookshelf past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and
munching to reveal Lee She is leaning against another
doorway a faraway look on her face as she listens to the
music Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway Several
people deep in conversation stand nearby as Elliot
holding a drink walks up behind her

ELLIOT
(sipping his drink)
Youve been very cold to me tonight

LEE
(glancing back at
Elliot then turning away)
No

ELLIOT
Is something wrong

INT HANNAHS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Holly is standing in the pantry preparing some offscreen
food Near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a

glass porthole In the foreground the kitchen table is

crowded with bowls and plates of food An open cupboard

separates Holly from the rest of the room

HOLLY
(looking offscreen)
Hey Hannah You know I think Lee
is really serious about her new
boyfriend Yeah eh from what I
understand he sounds really nice

Hannah walks into view headed for the refrigerator She
carries two tomatoes

HOLLY
Im so happy for her I think
shes in love

Hannah opens the refrigerator totally ignoring Holly

HOLLY
(reacting)
Hey whats the matter

HANNAH
(taking a bunch of
celery out and
slamming the
refrigerator door)
Im real upset about what you wrote

Hannah walks over to the table gathering up more food

HOLLY
My script

HANNAH
Its obviously based on Elliot and
me

HOLLY

Oh so loosely

HANNAH
(angrily)
No not Oh so loosely Real

specifically Is that how you see
us
HOLLY
(shrugging walking
out of the pantry area)
Well--

HANNAH
(interrupting)
Can I can I not accept gestures
and feelings from people Do I do
I put people off

Holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands

HOLLY
(reacting)
Well its a made-up story

She dries her hands as Hannah her arms laden with
vegetables strides over to her sister

HANNAH

(yelling)
No its real exact The-the
situations the dialogue everything
Its-its full of intimate details
between Elliot and me
Which I dont I dont see how you
could even possibly know about A
conversation we once had about
adoption

Hannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the
sink

HOLLY

(gesturing the towel

still in her hand as

she speaks to her

offscreen sister)
Well Lee mentioned that to me so
obviously you discussed it with her
You

(pacing around the table)
I just took the essence and I blew
it up into drama

Holly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the
kitchen carrying even more vegetables

HANNAH
I dont see how Lee could know
about these things I dont I
dont tell her everything

Hannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables
down on the counter Holly puts the dishtowel down and
absently straightens some things on the food-laden table

HOLLY
(reacting)
Wow I guess I hit a nerve

HANNAH
(turning to look at Holly)
You make it sound like you know I
have no needs or something You
think Im too self-sufficient

HOLLY

(stopping her mindless

straightening at the

table reacting)
Now Hannah thats not what I
meant you know

(walking offscreen to

the sink area)
Uh yeah everybody relies on you
for so much Youre so giving
Its not a criticism We love you
Were grateful

HANNAH
(walking out of the
pantry to the food-
laden table)
Youre grateful but you resent me

HOLLY
(offscreen)
Oh wow I dont want to have this
conversation I didnt do anything
wrong

Hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table Holly
walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket She stops
at the corner of the table and faces Hannah

HOLLY
(onscreen)
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that
you and Elliot were having some
problems
HANNAH

(gesturing)
Yeah were having some problems
but problems that are my
businesswhich I dont see how
you could know about in such detail
How does Lee know about these
things How Theyre private

Hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it as well as her
armload of spices into the pantry area

HOLLY
(turning to look at
her sister as she
walks past)
Well why dont you share them with
us

HANNAH
(with her back to the camera)
I dontI dont want to bother
everyone

HOLLY
(facing her sisters back)
Thats the point Id like to be
bothered

HANNAH
(turning to look at Holly)
I dont see how you could know
about these things unless Elliots
been talking to you

HOLLY
(shaking her head)
No he hasnt If I offended you
Im sorry

Hannah reacting puts the spices down on the pantry counter
Holly turns away

The film cuts to the dining room doorway Guests can be
seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet
table in the living room Lee and Elliot can be heard
offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across
the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an
intense conversation The piano as well as soft chatter
is heard in the background

LEE
(offscreen)
Its over Elliot I dont know
how to make it any clearer Its
over I cant see you anymore

ELLIOT
(offscreen overlapping)
Uh

LEE
(touching her chest)
Look Im just as much at fault

ELLIOT
(overlapping gesturing)

such feelings for you

LEE

(turning and walking

away from Elliot)
II told you I wasnt going to
wait forever

Lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
But it hasnt been forever
(walking over to Lee
at the just-closed door)

LEE

(gesturing)
Its been nearly a year since our
first time and youre still married
to my sister whichI now realize
is fine because youre probably
much more in love with her than you
know

ELLIOT
(shaking his head)
Yeah but we-we made so many plans

LEE
(overlapping gesturing)
Yeah Uh well sure we did An-
an-and in a way you led me on
because I truly believed you were
unhappy with Hannah Otherwise I
would never have let myself be

drawn in I was very weak So

were you Now Ive met someone else

The door opens and Mavis appears holding a set of
candlesticks She walks over to the dining room table
which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece
glassware and china She puts them down as Lee and Elliot
stand awkwardly near the door waiting for her to leave

LEE
(to Mavis)
Dinner soon

MAVIS
About fifteen minutes

LEE
(nodding)
Uh-huh Good

Mavis leaves Both Lee and Elliot quickly close the door
behind her and immediately pick up where theyd left off

ELLIOT
And youre in love overnight

LEE
I care a great deal about him yes

ELLIOT
(trying to put his
arm around Lee)
Lee

LEE
(pulling back
flinging her hands)
Ah its over Elliot I mean it

They look at each other reacting as the film cuts back to
Hannahs kitchen Normas face can be seen in the porthole
window on the other side of the pantrys swinging door She
looks around the kitchen then opens the door and steps
inside Holly stands nearby working in the pantry area

NORMA
(holding the door

half in and half out

of the kitchen)
Sweetheart I loved your script I
thought it was so clever

HOLLY
(turning to Norma
smiling and holding
a glass of wine)
Well youre my mother Not
everybodys gonna be such a sucker

NORMA
(gesturing)
I particularly liked the character
of the mother Just a boozy old
flirt with a filthy mouth

Holly chuckles

NORMA
Im so proud

HOLLY
Oh Mom thanks

Norma steps back out of the kitchen the door swinging shut
behind her Holly looks at the door sipping her wine as
the movie cuts back to Hannahs living room A chubby
friendly uncle sits on a sofa one child on his lap and
several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor

They lean on the coffee table which is covered with glasses
and a bowl of chips Other guests mingle in the background
one couple enters the living room smiling at the scene on
the sofa Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background
and opens the door to more guests The piano plays on

UNCLE
(raising his bottle
of beer to the children)
Now heres a toast to Thanksgiving
all right

The children mutter their enthusiastic agreement picking up
their illicit glasses of beer

UNCLE
Are we supposed to have beer
Yeeeah
The uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids
outstretched glasses They cry indistinctly with excitement

UNCLE
(overlapping the
childrens squeals of delight)
Let me at it
(to one of the little boys)
Hows that Fletcher

Laughing he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap he
clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding which
is almost as big as she is

UNCLE
(to the little girl)
Doll To Thanksgiving Heres a
little toast doll
(clinking glasses)
Come on Bottoms up

The uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the
movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in
Hannahs bedroom Her face moves on to the screen

HANNAH

(to the offscreen Elliot)
Have you been talking to Holly or
Lee about us About our-our
personal life

ELLIOT
(offscreen)

Me Of course not

HANNAH
Theres things Holly wrote about in
her script about us that are
sopersonal they could only have
come from you

ELLIOT
(offscreen)
Look Ive got a splitting headache
and I dont like being accused

Hannah walks towards Elliot hes in the bathroom standing
over the sink

HANNAH
(gesturing)
Im not accusing Im asking Do

(closing the door of

the bathroom slightly

so only she is seen

on the screen)
Too-too-too competent Too-too I

ELLIOT
No

Elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an
offscreen medicine cabinet

HANNAH
(following Elliot and
gesturing talking to
his back)
Well what is it then What Eh
whats come between us How have I
alienated you

ELLIOT
(taking a bottle of
aspirin from the
cabinet and walking
back to the sink gesturing)
Hannah my head is throbbing
HANNAH
(gesturing)
You never want to talk about it
I-- Every time I bring it up you-
you change the subject What is it
Do you-- Were communicating less
and less You sleep with me less
and less

ELLIOT
(angrily turning to
Hannah and pointing
as she shouts)
Hannah I am very mixed up Now

Elliot turns back to the sink once again obscured by the
partially closed door

HANNAH
(reacting her voice
trembling slightly
and gesturing)
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind
my back Do you You must They-
they seem to know so much about us

ELLIOT
(walking towards a
towel rack and gesturing)
Well maybe Ive asked advice once
or twice or-or made a joke

He dries his hands as Hannah standing behind him continues
to talk

HANNAH
(gesturing)
Well what do you do Do-do-do you
talk to Holly or Lee or what Do
you do you do you phone them

ELLIOT
(whirling around to
face Hannah snapping)
Leave me alone can you

He closes the door briefly obscuring Hannah and himself
from view

ELLIOT
(continuing ina
lower tone)
Jesus Ive told you I need
someone I can matter to

The camera moves behind the closed door into the bathroom

HANNAH
(reacting near tears)
You matter to me Completely

ELLIOT
(pausing his voice
rising again)
Its hard to be around someone who
gives so much and-and needs so
little in return

He opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle
back

HANNAH
(gesturing pleading)
But lookI-I have enormous needs
Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut

ELLIOT
(shouting)
Well I cant see them and neither
can Lee or Holly

He leaves Hannah watches him go reacting She is stunned
CUT TO
INT HANNAHS LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

The dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the
offscreen foyer pictures line the wall Piano music is
still heard very softly in the background as Hannah hugging
herself walks slowly down the hallway into the living room
She briefly looks around lost in thought She sits down
heavily tiredly on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts
to several framed photographs on the mantel One shows
Hannah and Elliot on their wedding day Another shows
Elliot obscured in the shadows Yet another has captured
Norma as a young girl The camera however moves closer
and closer to a photograph showing Hannah Lee and Holly
the three sisters smiling into the camera There is no

records reacting to his words She looks offscreen at him

Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly The two of them are
partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with
a large red circle as they continue their conversation

up her hand on her head

Unable to contain herself she begins to walk up and down
the room holding her script The camera follows her
Mickey is now offscreen

HOLLY
(laughing)
Oh God

(pausing grinning)
God you really liked it

You Made Me Love You starts to play as the movie cuts to

the street outside Mickeys apartment house

complete with a red entrance door and a gray

facade

Trees line the sidewalk
from the door and walk up the street
of similar apartment buildings

an old building

weather-beaten

Holly and Mickey emerge
revealing a whole row
They pass a few other
people as they walk

The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and
stainedwood café Through the window Holly and Mickey can
be seen having lunch Holly is talking animatedly Mickey
takes a sip of coffee Some people pass by

Next the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central
Park complete with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered

leaves Holly and Mickey stroll into view deep in
conversation
HOLLY
(gesturing)

Gosh you really went through a
crisis you know that H-how did
you get over it I mean when I
ran into you you seemed you
seemed just perfectly fine Well
you seem fine now

MICKEY
Well
(chuckling)
Tll tell you
(sighing)

One day about a month ago

The film abruptly cuts to Mickeys flashback a visual
counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly A close-up
of a nervous perspiring and panting Mickey alone in his
apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard

MICKEY (VO)
I really hit bottom You know
I just felt that in a Godless
universe I didnt want to go on
living Now I happen to own this
rifle
(coughing)

Mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead He
shuts his eyes tightly

MICKEY (VO)
-which I loaded believe it or
not and pressed it to my forehead
And I remember thinking at the
time Im gonna kill myself Then
I thoughtwhat if Im wrong
What if there is a God I mean
after all nobody really knows that

The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on
the wall behind him Its reflection shows his spiral
staircase and some standing lamps A clock faintly ticks

MICKEY (VO)
But then I thought no You know
maybe is not good enough I want
certainty or nothing And I
remember very clearly the clock was
ticking and I was sitting there
frozen with the gun to my head
debating whether to shoot

The gun goes off with a loud bang The mirror shatters

MICKEY (VO)
All of a sudden the gun went off

Mickey holding the rifle is seen running over to the
shattered mirror The sounds of his excited neighbors
their shouting a knocking door are heard as he continues

his tale

MICKEY (VO)
I had been so tense my finger had
squeezed the trigger inadvertently

NEIGHBOR 1
(offscreen overlapping)
Whats happening Wh-wh-whats
going on

MICKEY (VO)
(continuing)
but I was perspiring so much
the gun had slid off my forehead
and missed me

NEIGHBOR 2
(offscreen overlapping)
I dont know I heard a gun Is
everything all right

Mickey still brandishing the rifle runs into his sunlit

living room

Finally he

He looks around frantically his shirt loose

throws the rifle down between the sofa and the

coffee table The gun goes off a second time Mickey
standing nearby jumps his hands flying to his head The
doorbell rings the neighbors begin pounding at the door

MICKEY (VO)
And suddenly neighbors were were
pounding on the door and-and I
dont know the whole scene was
just pandemonium And uh you
know and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door

Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door

MICKEY (VO)
I-I-I-I didnt know what to say
You know I was I was embarrassed
and confused and my-my-my mind was
r-r-racing a mile a minute

He returns onscreen panting he looks frantically once
again around the living room

MICKEY (VO)
and I-I jus knew one thing

The film cuts to a West Side street Its an overcast day
Mickey walking slowly along the sidewalk passes several
other pedestrians and numerous storefronts including
Kleins Pharmacy and a Bar-B-Q take out Occasionally he
is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the
street a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene

MICKEY (VO)
II-I-I-I had to get out of that
house I had to just get out in
the fresh air and-and clear my head
And I remember very clearly I
walked the streets I walked and I
walked I-I didnt know what was
going through my mind It all
seemed so violent and un-unreal to
me And I wandered

The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater
with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel
An old publicity photo hangs inside Mickeys reflection is
seen at the almost-transparent doors as well as the
reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by His
reflection walks towards the theater entrance he continues
his story

MICKEY (VO)
for a long time on the Upper
West Side you know an-and it must
have been hours You know my my
feet hurt My head was was
pounding and and I had to sit
down I went into a movie house
I-I didnt know what was playing or
anything

Mickey walks into the movie house He is seen through the
glass doors which still reflect the street and traffic
outside He makes his way through the lobby into the actual
theater

MICKEY (VO)
I just I just needed a moment to
gather my thoughts and and be
logical and and put the world
back into rational perspective

The film abruptly cuts to the theaters black-and-white
screen where the Marx Brothers in Duck Soup play the
helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live
xylophone The sounds of the xylophone are heard as the
movie cuts to the darkened theater where Mickey slowly sits
down in a balcony seat The xylophone music stops and
changes to Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho as sung
by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie The singing
continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his
tale

MICKEY (VO)

And I went upstairs to the balcony
and I sat down

(sighing)
and you know the movie was a-a-a
film that Id seen many times in my
life since I was a kid an-and I
always u-uh loved it And you
know Im Im watching these
people up on the screen and I
started getting hooked o-on the
film you know

The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as
Mickey continues to talk The Marx Brothers as well as the
hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup are kneeling
and bowing as they sing Hidee-hidee-ho They kick their
heels up in the air They sway back and forth hands
clasped singing Oh-h-h-h-h-h

MICKEY (VO)
And I started to feel how can
you even think of killing yourself
I mean isnt it so stupid I
mean l-look at all the people up
there on the screen You know
theyre real funny and and what
if the worst is true

The movie cuts back to Mickey sitting almost obscured in
the dark theater The Oh-h-h-h-h-hs coming from the
offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak

MICKEY (VO)
What if theres no God and you
only go around once and thats it
Well you know dont you want to
be part of the experience You
know what the hell it-i-its not
all a drag And Im thinking to
myself geez I should stop ruining
my life

As Mickey talks the film cuts back to the antics of the

Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen The
four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting

their voices indistinct over Mickeys narration

MICKEY (VO)
searching for answers Im never
gonna get and just enjoy it while
it lasts Andyou know

The film is back on Mickeys dark form in the audience

MICKEY (VO)
after who knows I mean you
now maybe there is something
Nobody really knows I know I
now maybe is a very slim reed to
hang your whole life on but thats
the best we have Andthen I
started to sit back and I actually
began to enjoy myself

As Mickey continues the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the
black-and-white screen The Marx Brothers are sitting ona
judges bench playing banjos and singing with the other
cast members They jump down from the bench still singing
Their voices swell

MARX BROTHERS and COMPANY
Oh Freedonia
Oh dont you cry for me
Theyll be coming around the
mountain
The Marx Brothers kneel strumming their banjos and the
movie cuts back to Central Park The flashback is over
Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as You Made Me Love
You begins to play in the background They pass some
people a cluster of buildings that look like castles and
the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees as the
camera moves back farther and farther away from them
showing a beautiful Central Park frozen in time

HOLLY

(gesturing)
Umlook theres something Ive
uh thats been bothering me for a
long time and I just thought Id
just tell you what it was and just
sort of clear the deck here and

(chuckling)
thats this

MICKEY
(mumbling)
Oh yeah What

HOLLY
(overlapping)
That Ive always regretted the way
I behaved that evening we went out
and uhIve I just thought Id
tell you that because I really made
a fool out of myself

MICKEY
Oh dont be silly No Dont be
ridiculous
HOLLY
(overlapping)

Its all right

MICKEY

(inhaling)
Holly laughs
MICKEY

HOLLY
Sure Sure uh yes

MICKEY
(overlapping)
Do you I mean are you are you

HOLLY
Yeah

They stroll offscreen You Made Me Love You grows louder
and the film cuts to

One year later
CUT TO
INT HANNAHS APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT

A large perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly
fills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden
table in Hannahs kitchen past an electric mixer several
bowls spices tomatoes and parsley to reveal Evan walking
through the doorway

EVAN
(holding a drink)

I want ice Whos got some--
(pointing to an ice
bucket on the table)

Oh there it is

HANNAH
(offscreen overlapping)
Its on the table Dad

The sounds of Thanksgiving guests in the other room are

dimly heard You Made Me Love You continues softly in the
background Mavis passes the table licking some food off
her hand Hannah in the background is busy by the stove

EVAN
(putting ice into his glass)
Hey wheres Holly Shes late

As Mavis leaves the kitchen Lee enters carrying some empty
glasses
(walking briskly to

the sink)
Hey Hannah did you read that last
thing Holly wrote It was great
Shes really developed

HANNAH
(offscreen in
another area of the kitchen)
I know sheshe really writes
good dialogue

LEE
(turning to the
offscreen Hannah)
Yeah Ill get some ice

Lee walks off drying her wet hands in the air Hannah in
a silk dress moves onscreen going to the table and pouring
herself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen

NORMA
Hannah can I tell everybody youre
going to play Desdemona

Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a
bottle of gin

HANNAH
(taking a big sip of
her wine)

Oh Mom its only television
(beginning to mash
some sweet potatoes
in a bowl on the table)

NORMA
(gesturing with the bottle)
Yes but its public television
And to me Shakespeare doesnt get
any greater than Othello You with
some big black stud I love it

Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her
empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing reacting

HANNAH
(gasping and laughing)
Oh Mom

EVAN
(overlapping reacting)
Oh honey

The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between
the dining room and the living room Upbeat jazz plays over
the low din of the party Two women stand by the partially
set dining room table chatting and arranging some plates
as Elliot strolls into view sipping a drink He passes the
women and walks through the doorway into the living room
nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way

He enters the living room smiling It is crowded with
guests Hannahs children play in their midst One of
Hannahs boys grabs Elliots arm They playfully spar for
a moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off continuing
on his way into a connecting room He stops at the doorway
looking at the crowd The camera shows his point of view
Guests stand in clusters enjoying themselves one woman
chats with a little boy another woman carrying a drink
walks over to a group of other guests

The film then cuts back briefly to Elliot holding his drink
and looking straight ahead as it shows his point of view
once more This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug
talking animatedly a few guests are seen in the background
Elliots voice is heard over a close-up of the couple

ELLIOT (V0O)
Oh Lee you are something

Lee and Doug kiss each other They continue talking

ELLIOT (V0O)
You look very beautiful Marriage
agrees with you Everything that
happened between us
(pausing)
seems more and more hazy

As Lee takes a sip of her drink the movie cuts back to
Elliot standing in the doorway and still staring straight
ahead The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks
over the scene

ELLIOT (V0O)
I acted like such a fool TI dont
know what came over me That
complete conviction that I couldnt
live without you

The film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug still
talking animatedly and smiling Lee gently pushes back
Dougs hair

ELLIOT (V0O)
What did I put us both through
And Hannah

The camera moves back to Elliot

ELLIOT (V0O)
(continuing)
who as you once said I love
much more than I realized

After pausing for a moment on Elliots face the film cuts
to the foyer where two boys and a girl gather by the door
One boy opens it revealing Holly She joyfully enters the
apartment greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss

HOLLY
(kissing the children)
Hi How are you

doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen

to her They look at each other for a beat Elliot then
hugs Hannah pulling her towards him She leans her head on
his shoulder fingering his jacket lapel They look
offscreen together happily intimately at the offscreen
guests as the camera moves across the room past a few
guests to reveal Evan sitting at the piano Norma sits at
his side one arm resting on the piano She holds a drink
and looks off in the distance mouthing the words to Isnt
