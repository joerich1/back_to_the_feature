EXT WEST SIDE HIGHWAY — NIGHT
O A black dog sleeps on the shoulder of the highway head
between his paws curled up next to the barricade that
separates the north and southbound lanes

Traffic rumbles past him yellow cabs blue police cruisers
white limousines with tinted glass and Jersey plates

We hear the squeal of brakes A black 65 Ford Mustang mint
condition pulls onto the shoulder ten yards past the dog
and backs up The dog raises its head

Two men step out of the car The driver MONTY BROGAN mid-
twenties is pale-skinned in the flickering light A small
silver crucifix hangs from a silver chain around his neck
his fingers are adorned with silver rings

The passenger KOSTYA NOVOTNY a hulking man in his late
thirties blows his nose in his handkerchief

Its a cold night Monty wears a camels hair overcoat
Kostya an old blue Soviet Navy coat

MONTY
Hes alive
KOSTYA
(Ukrainian accent)
This dog how do you call it
MONTY °
Pit bull Must have lost somebody some

money
The dog stares at them and they stare at the dog

KOSTYA a
What do we do Monty we watch him rot

wo ms 0 2 eee MONTY oe tt rth ‘ee
I was thinking of shooting him

KOSTYA
Shooting him Are you sick in the head

The dog continues to stare at them impassively his face lit
by the passing headlights The pavement by his paws is
littered with broken glass twisted scraps of metal black
rubber from blown tires

( )

oo

“SS

MONTY
They just left him here to die They
threw him out the window and kept
driving

A ships horn sounds from the Hudson

KOSTYA
Come my friend it is cold Come people
wait for us

MONTY
Theyre used to waiting

Monty squats near the dog and inspects him From this angle
it is clear that the pit bull has been badly abused One ear
has been chewed to mince his hide is scored with cigarette
burns flies crawl in his bloodied fur

MONTY (CONTD)
I think maybe his hip—

The dog pounces jaws snapping lunging for Montys face

Monty stumbles backwards The dog too badly injured to

continue the attack remains in his crouch growling

Monty sits on the pavement shaking his head

MONTY (CONTD)
Christ
(beat )
Hes got some bite left

KOSTYA

I think he does not want to play with

you Come you want police to pull over

You want police looking through your car
MONTY

Look what they did to him Used him for a

fucking ashtray

Monty stands and dusts his palms on the seat of his pants

MONTY (CONTD)
Lets get him in the trunk

KOSTYA
What

( )

MONTY
Theres a vet emergency room on the East
Side I like this guy

KOSTYA
You like him He tries to bite your face
off Look at him he is meat You want
some dog I buy younice puppy tomorrow

Monty is not listening He walks back to his car opens the
trunk pulls out a soiled green army blanket

Kostya holds up his hands stop

KOSTYA (CONTD)
Wait one minute please Please stop one
minute I do not go near pit bull Monty
I do not go near pit bull

Monty carrying the army blanket walks back toward the dog

MONTY
This is a good dog I can see it in his
eyes Hes a tough little bastard

KOSTYA
Sometimes I think you are very stupid
man

The dog has slumped back to the pavement His breath comesin

shorts rasps and wheezes But he never takes his eyes off the
two men

MONTY
We wait much longer hell be dead

KOSTYA
One minute ago you want to shoot him

MONTY
That was a mercy thing But hes not
ready to go yet

KOSTYA
Yes He told you this

Monty slowly circles behind the dog holding the blanket the
way a matador wields his cape

MONTY
Distract him

Kostya stares at his friend in disbelief He looks down A
crumpled soda can lies by his feet He kicks the can

The dogs head pivots to follow the aluminum flash

Monty hurls the blanket over the dog and spring forward
wrapping his arms around the dogs midsection The dog
growls bites the wool tries to break the blankets neck

Monty lurches toward the Mustang struggling to retain his
bearhug while the pit bull slithers in his grasp As they

stumble closer to the car the dog releases the blanket and
snaps at Montys throat

Monty hurls the dog into the trunk and slams the lid He
returns to the drivers seat

Kostya watches him in silence stares at the sky for a few
seconds finally gets back in the car The dog thrashes in
the trunk

INT MUSTANG

Both men sit in silence as Monty revs the engine Blood is
beginning to leak from a bite on the right side of Montys
neck

KOSTYA
What goes on in your little head

Monty grins He has no idea that hes bleeding
MONTY

I got him didnt I Surprised you how
-——quick I was huh -

Monty checks for traffic and pulls back onto the highway

KOSTYA
Yes you are so quick

He points at the wound on Montys neck which has begun to
flow faster

KOSTYA (CONTD)
Meanwhile you are bleeding

MONTY
Thats the dogs blood

KOSTYA

Oh Because you have hole in your neck
and blood is coining out

( )
Theyll stitch it up at the vets

KOSTYA
Rule number one dont grab half-dead pit
bulls We have people waiting for us
people with money and you go playing
cowboy— no dogboy-— in middle of
highway

Monty laughs his hand pressed to the side of his neck blood

leaking between his fingers

KOSTYA (CONTD)
Yes ha ha Youre bad luck You bring
bad luck on me Always everything that
can go wrong goes wrong It is not just
you and me when we go out no no it is
you me and Mister Doyle of Doyles law

Monty frowns

MONTY
Doyles law You mean Murphys law

KOSTYA
Whos Murphy

MONTY
Whos Doyle Murphys law whatever can
go wrong will go wrong

KOSTYA
Yes Him

DOYLE (for the nameless pit bull has become Doyle) growls
Monty tugs on his leash and Doyle grunts and quiets down

YOUNG MAN 1
What up Monty

Monty nods but doesnt say anything Hes studying the view
He stares at the green river the steel bridges the red
tugboats the stone lighthouse of Roosevelt Island

Doyle barks and Monty turns SIMON a bone-thin man in his
early thirties approaches them He wears rubber boots that
rise to his knees and a dirty yellow down parka

SIMON
Easy Doyle easy buddy Whats up

Monty turns back to the river Doyle barks again

SIMON (CONTD)
You want to tell the dog to relax Hey

Doyle has extended the leash as far as Monty will allow He
sniffs suspiciously at Simon

SIMON (CONTD)
I dont think your dog likes me

Doyle snarls Simon repockets the money

Simon points at a line of scabs that run along his throat

SIMON

Monty finally stands and walks toward the man closer and

closer until their faces are inches apart

MONTY

You need to leave me alone friend I

Doyle sniffs Simons boots then raises his

climbing the mans leg Simon dances a half-

head snout
step trying to

keep away from the pit bull without provoking him

SIMON

Simon blinks tries to JLaugh looks behind himlooks down at

Doyle rubs his nose with the back of his hand

SIMON

Five years Ive been coming to you All

Monty and Doyle watch the man go they begin walking in the
opposite direction They pass the concrete chessboards the
sandboxes and pause for a moment by a basketball court

Six TEENS play— with little skill— one last game before

school Monty shakes his head disdainfully
player dribble at the top of the key

MONTY
You got no left

watching one

( )

The player drives right and misses an open lay-up Monty
spits and continues walking Doyle leading the way

EXT CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL — LATER

Monty looks up at the old private school tucked away on a
leafy street on the Upper East Side

Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by People
are always looking at Monty

Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before
crushing them out and entering the school

INT CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL

Monty walks down a corridor of the school building Doyle
padding along beside him STUDENTS hurrying to their
classes stare at the dog and then at Monty

The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty
Monty stops before a row of framed photographs He examines
one photograph and smiles

back

MONTY (CONTD)

MONTY

ADMINISTRATOR
I was there when he broke the record

Monty nods and continues on his way The administrator
watches man and dog walk down the long corridor

INT CAMPBELL-SAWYER CLASSROOM

JAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard facing three rows of
uninspired teenage faces He wears a tweed jacket that seems
a few sizes too large with chalk stains on the sleeves

Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger There is
something adolescent in his slouch in the way he chews his

lip

One of his students MARY DANNUNZIO stands at her
desk reading from a poetry textbook Her eyes drown in pools
of painted shadow her hair is dyed black tattooed roses
garland her wrist

MARY

(O 900s © (reading) - ee — Cad o- eR le hy

Let us roll all our strength and all

Our sweetness up into one ball

And tear pur pleasures with rough strife
Through the iron gates of life

Jakob watches her We dont know the Campbell-Sawyerdress
code but we can guess that shes violating it We can also
guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly
Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt
MARY (CONTD)
(reading)

Thus though we cannot make our sun
Stand still yet we will make him run

Mary shrugs and sits down

JAKOB
Good good excellent reading Um okay

JAKOB (CONTD)
Okay-

LUKE a sullen-looking student with a shaved head and a

failed goatee raises his hand

JAKOB (CONTD)

LUKE

JAKOB
No You went twenty minutes ago

LUKE

JAKOB
The poem The poem folks Hello

MARY
Its not real deep or anything The guy
wants to get laid and hes telling her to
give it up

A few of the students titter half-heartedly

A knock on the door releases Jakob from his hell He goes to

answer it and thenstops startled

Its the type ofdoor popular in school buildings with a
wire-reinforced glass panel at head height allowing you to

look into the classroom without disturbing anyone

Doyle tongue dangling from his mouth stares back at Jakob

through the panel

MARY (CONTD)
I didnt know your mother was coming
today Luke

LUKE
Eat me

Jakob opens the door

( )

Monty stands there holding up Doyle Doyle scrambles out of
his arms and jumps on Jakob nearly knocking the teacher

down getting his dirty paws all over Jakobs j

MONTY
Easy Doyle

acket

Doyle immediately calms down squatting by Jakobs feet and

staring up at the teacher

JAKOB
Hey— uh whats going on

Jakob seems awkward around Monty nervous
MONTY ‘

Look at him He loves you
Jakob looks at Doyle who wags the stump of his

Jakob turns and sees Mary staring at them He quickly turns
back to Monty who is smiling at Mary Jakob grabs the door
knob

JAKOB
Okay so Ill see you later

Monty nods

MONTY
Tell Frank well meet up after midnight

He leads Doyle away and Jakob closes the door then turns to

look at his silent class The bell rings and all the students
grab their bags
INT TEACHERS LOUNGE — LATER

Jakob alone in the room sits on a sofa his head in his
hands He looks up when he hears a knock on the door

Mary DAnnunzio peeks in

MARY
You have a minute

Jakob sits up straighter and smiles
JAKOB
Sure Come in

teachers lounge

Mary walks into the room looking around suspiciously Jakob
points at a chair

Mary yanks her bookbag off the floor and straps it on her

shoulder

( )

MARY
(muttering)
Forget it

She stomps out of the lounge her black combat boots clomping

on the corridors linoleum floor

Jakob shakes his head and looks up at the clock 915 He
reaches for the phone sitting on the coffee table

INT SHREVE ZIMMER INVESTMENT BANK — SAME TIME

FRANK SLATTERY also in his mid-twenties stares at the row

of clocks on the far wall Below each clock is a sign Tokyo
Hong Kong Frankfurt London The clock marked New York reads

915
The trading floor is one giant room rows of TRADERS seated
before their computers jabbering into their telephone
headsets No women— the place is loud and aggressive

Slattery is built like a former college wrestler thick-

necked broken-nosed muscular his hair retreating from his

forehead his eyes undercast with dark crescents
One of his phones rings He answers

soo —-—SEATTERY - ee
Frank Slattery

He listens ‘for one second

He hangs up the phone and returns his gaze to the computer
screens in front of him Clearly hes waiting for something
and clearly hes anxious

LICHTER (0S)
Coming out with us later on

Slattery looks up at his boss ARI LICHTER early forties a
plump genial man

SLATTERY
Nah Im meeting some friends tonight

LICHTER
Big date

The subject clearly makes Slattery uncomfortable

SLATTERY
More of a going-away party

LICHTER
Listen the other thing youre still
holding onto all those contracts

SLATTERY
Why youre nervous

LICHTER
I dont like it The claims numbers have
dropped three weeks straight

SLATTERY
And everybodys thinking if claims have
dropped employment must be up

LICHTER
Everybodys thinking that because its
pretty much always true

SLATTERY
- Not this time

LICHTER
Frank—

SLATTERY
Ive got a theory

LICHTER
Oh good youve got a theory Look
youre in awfully deep Youve got sixty
million of the banks money in there—

Se

SLATTERY
A hundred million

The news startles Lichter

LICHTER
A hundred million Jesus Frank

SLATTERY
They authorized me to a hundred million

Other traders sitting nearby have begun watching this
exchange and Lichter is careful to keep his voice down

LICHTER
A week ago They raised your limit a week
ago and youre already maxing out

SLATTERY
Im telling you were in for a low
number One-forty maybe one-thirty-five

LICHTER
Cut your stake in half all right Youve
been doing a great job everyone knows
that but Im still your boss and Im
telling you sell those contracts

Lichter grips Slatterys shoulder for a moment and then walks
toward his office (a real office with walls anda door)’
exchanging hellos with other traders on the floor

PHELAN fresh from college walks down the row handing fax
sheets to all the traders He hands a sheet to Slattery who
looksat—it briefly before crumpling it -- cscs eee

PHELAN
Sollies looking for a high number Two
hundred and ‘eighty thousands their call

SLATTERY
Fuck Sollie

PHELAN
Fuck Salomon Brothers

SLATTERY
Theyre hedging their bets They want
everyone on their side of the fence

PHELAN

Whats the big deal with the employment
number anyway

Saeed
WJ ae seepete

Slattery doesnt want to discuss this right now

SLATTERY
More jobs means fewer people looking for
work right Which means its harder to
find the right people for a job which
means you got to raise wages to get them
which means inflation goes up— you

PHELAN
(ot following)
Yeah

Slattery frowns

SLATTERY
Youre wearing a striped shirt with a
striped tie

Phelan looks down at his tie

PHELAN
Yeah Is that bad

SLATTERY

You look like a fueking optical iliwsiom
Go away

Phelan walks away nervously adjusting his tie

MARCUSE peeks over the partition in front of Slattery With
his slicked-back hair red suspenders and obnoxious smirk
Marcuse looks like a man who owns the Gordon Gekko action

figure
- MARGUSE-- -- 0 we
Better hop to sonny boy

“sglattery says nothing just stabs angrily at his keyboard

MARCUSE (CONTD)
I dont see you picking up the phone
Didnt Lichter just tell you to sell
Sounds like your allowance got cut off

Slattery nostrils flared pretends to ignore the taunts
MARCUSE (CONTD)

Youre not going to disobey a direct
order are you

( )

Slattery rolls back in his wheeled office chair and stares at
Marcuse

SLATTERY
I dont come into your bedroom and tell
you how to fuck your wife do I

Marcuse grins He calls to another trader down the floor

MARCUSE
Hey Schultz what are we looking at for
the employment number

SCHULTZ
(yelling from his desk)
Two-fifty two-seventy somewhere in
there

Marcuse sits down again disappearing behind the partition
Slattery glowers at his desk He picks up his phone and holds
the receiver to his ear never dialing a number

Lichter calls to Slattery from his office door

LICHTER
Slattery Were good

Slattery nods and gives a thumbs up As soon as Lichter
returns to his office Slattery hangs up the phone

Marcuse sticks his head above the partition again

MARCUSE
Good thing you got rid of those
- contracts-Looks like’a huge number on-— -e—«
the way

The tradingfloor suddenly— and eerily- goes quiet
Everyones attention is fixed on the television monitors
hanging from the ceilings The monitors are muted closed
captioning-files along the bottoms of the screens

Each monitor is tuned to the same station a financial
network broadcasting the employment numbers release A
REPORTER wearing a bowtie reads the statistics

Slattery bows his head He holds his hands in his lap and
closes his eyes For a long while the room is very quiet

Then a commotion of shouts and groans riles the floor
Everyone is hollering at the same time and we can only make
out a few phrases

Slattery looks up at the nearest monitor A white number is
emblazoned on a blue background 138112 Every monitor in
the room flashes the same number

Slattery stares at his computer screen There it is again
displayed prominently in the largest window 138 112

Slattery raises his eyebrows He juggles the crumpled fax
sheet a few times and then tosses it over the partition
where Marcuse is sitting

MARCUSE (0S)
Fuck you Slattery

Slattery grins and leans back in his chair hands behind his
head

EXT MONTYS BUILDING — LATE AFTERNOON

A four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville
NATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps reading a book

Naturelle in her early twenties has the lean body of a
runner Its cold outside but she doesnt seem to mind When
she sees Monty coming she closes the book and stands

NATURELLE
How long have you guys been walking I

He holds the door open for her and Doyle
INT MONTYS APARTMENT
Monty closes the apartment door behind Naturelle and Doyle

then locks it There are five locks and a heavy steel
deadbolt

MONTY
What am I thinking about

Despite the ominous security its a nice one-bedroom
apartment with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the
brownstones across the street
Black-and-white photographs line the walls shots of the
Manhattan skyline of Bensonhurst of Doyle The largest
photo hanging above the sofa is of Brogans Bar
Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep
Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the
remote
WEATHERMAN
The first major storm of winter is
heading our way—
Monty turns off the television He stares at the dead screen
Naturelle comes out of the kitchen carrying a jar of honey
and a spoon
She hands the jar to Monty who opens it for her She sits
— --e beside him and begins eating the honey watching him He sees
her watching
MONTY

NATURELLE
What are you thinking about

He leans forward and unclips a hand-tooled leather holster
from the back of his belt A B for Brogan is tooled into
the leather stylized like the old Brooklyn Dodgers logo
C A 40 caliber automatic squat and black rests in the
a holster Monty drops the holster onto the coffee table and
runs his fingers over the B Naturelle stares at the gun

Naturelle hits him on the shoulder

NATURELLE

NATURELLE

Monty reclines arms spread wide and resting on the sofas
a back cushions

MONTY

He watches her eat another spoonful of raw honey

MONTY (CONTD)
Thats a nasty habit you have

She leans forward and kisses him on the lips

NATURELLE
Come take a bath with me

MONTY
Not right now

or She caresses his jaw but Monty is distant his mind
“s- elsewhere

O She sets the honey jar on the table and walks out of the
living room Monty listens to her in the bathroom drawing

the bathwater

He listens to the sound of running water

CUT TO
INT MONTYS BATHROOM — SIX MONTHS AGO
massaging her shoulders Music plays from a radio on the
windowsill
She is laughing at something he just said He leans closer
and kisses the back of her neck behind her ears She
stretches back lifting one leg out of the bath
He runs his hand down her thigh and then stops looking at
the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on her ankle She follows his
gaze to the tattoo and then groans

NATURELLE
Not this again

SC MONTY
You were born in America you lived in
America your whole life youve been to
Puerto Rico twice for vacation What is
that I should get an Irish flag tattooed
on my ass cause my grandparents are from
there

NATURELLE
Youdont have room on your ass for an
Irish flag

Monty dips his hands into the warm water reaches below her

Naturelle sits’ on Montys lap in the narrow bathtub Hes
grabs her butt Naturelle shrieks and Monty laughs

fo MONTY
Between you and me the kids will be just
right

Loud pounding on the apartment door startles them They stare
at each other Doyle barks from the other room

Naturelle gets out of the tub pulls on a bathrobe and goes
to answer the door Monty waits listening He knows who it
is He stares out the bathrooms open window

INT MONTYS LIVING ROOM — STILL IN FLASHBACK

Monty wearing sweatpants and no shirt walks into the living
room Four DEA AGENTS all wearing DEA windbreakers and
shoulder holsters wait for him

Doyle ears back growls at the agents Monty scratches
Doyles head and the dog relaxes a bit

Naturelle panicked stares at Monty Shes still holding the
apartment door open

MONTY
Close the door baby

She closes the door

AGENT BRZOWSKI
Montgomery Brogan

MONTY

Brzowski flips open a badge and hands a paper to Monty who
looks it over

AGENT BRZOWSKI

Brzowksi walks over to the sofa and sits down The other
three agents stroll around the apartment One looks out the
window one starts flipping through a magazine on the coffee
table one stares at a photograph on the wall

AGENT CUNNINGHAM
You take this picture

MONTY

AGENT CUNNINGHAM

When one of the agents steps too close to Doyle the dog
growls and the agent jumps back

MONTY

Monty whistles and Doyle stands and walks over to him Monty
crouches one hand stroking Doyles thick neck

Naturelle uncomfortable wearing only the bathrobe begins
heading back to the bedroom

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)
Ms Rosario Thats your name right I
need you to stay right here maam

He winks at her

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)
Cant have you sneaking around

Naturelle leans against the wall looking for a sign from
Monty who gives her none

The agents dont seem to be searching very hard

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)
Hm

He stares down at the sofa hes sitting on

AGENTBRZOWSKI (CONT-D)
This sofa is not very comfortable

Monty stares at the agent for a second and then exhales He
turns and looks carefully at Naturelle

AGENT CUNNINGHAM

AGENT BRZOWSKI
I just dont understand It looks like
such a nice sofa How much did you pay
for this sofa Ms Rosario

Brzowksi stands and looks down at the cushion Monty is still
staring at Naturelle who meets his eye for a second and then
quickly turns away

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)
Maybe its the padding

AGENT CUNNINGHAM
Could be the padding

Brzowski picks up the center cushion turns it in his hands
and unzips it

AGENT BRZOWSKI
Probably the padding

He pulls out handfuls of white fiber filling and lets them
drift to the floor Monty and Naturelle watch

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)
Yeah theres something lumpy in here
Mr Brogan Its a good thing I found
this you know Itll make your sofa much
more comfortable to sit on

The other agents laugh Brzowski pulls out a package the size
of a bottle of wine from the cushion a bundle of plastic
wrap and masking tape

Brzowski raises his eyebrows in mock shock while the other
agents poh and cluck — my em ee

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)

EXT MONTYS BUILDING

Kostya sits on the top step of the stoop sipping froma
silver flask A female JOGGER runs past and Kostya calls
after her

KOSTYA

She doesnt look in his direction He takes another swig from
t- his flask mt ys

A young MOTHER pushes a baby stroller past the stoop

KOSTYA (CONTD)
Hello beautiful mother Hello little
baby

The mother doesnt look at him but the two-year old GIRL
fascinated stares at him

KOSTYA (CONTD)
(calling after mother)
€ ‘ You look like Julia Roberts They tell

Monty opens the front door He stares down at Kostya

Kostya shrugs again

KOSTYA

KOSTYA

Monty shakes his head and walks down the stairs

MONTY
Youre insane She wouldnt do that
KOSTYA
No Did you ask her

Kostya stands at the top of the stoop He feels something and
raises his palms to the air The snow has begun to fall

He looks up into the sky Something catches his eye-— in one
of the fourth floor windows Naturelle is staring down at
him

Kostya watches her She lets the curtain close Kostya takes
another slug from his flask

parkas and knit caps crouch near the edge of the platform
pointing down at the tracks and laughing

( )

MONTY
Whats down there

The boys point and Monty looks We follow his gaze We cant
see anything at first but then as if our eyes were
adjusting to the dark we begin to pick out movement

A gang of large RATS crawls through the tracks nosing
through balled-up paper bags candy wrappers and orange
peels

BOY 1
These ones they eat rat poison like
chocolate

The biggest rat of all sniffs around the base of an upright
wax-paper coffee cup that sits just outside the third rail

Monty reaches into the pocket of his camels hair coat and
pulls out a handful of change

MONTY
Watch this

He selects a quarter and— with a free throw motion as smooth
as Hersey Hawkinss— tosses it into the empty cup a ten-
foot shot

The big rat startled hustles into the alcove below the lip
of the platform The hoys impressed whistle

MONTY (CONTD)
Here—

He offers his palmful of change

‘MONTY (CONTD)
Take a shot at it

The boys look at each other for a moment before each takes a
coin They stare up at Monty He nods at them

MONTY (CONTD)
Lets see what you got

Boy 1 takes careful aim at the coffee cup His shot is way
off target though— it pings off the tile on the far side of
the tunnel

MONTY (CONTD)
Your release is too high Look—

He mimics the boys shooting motion

Boy 2 toes the edge of the yellow danger line and practices
his motion When he finally releases the coin it flashes
through the air and drops neatly into the cup

MONTY (CONTD)

He raises his fist and the boy taps knuckles grinning

EXT BROGANS BAR — NIGHT

The snow is falling faster We watch the flakes spin through
a yellow cone of streetlight

We see the bar from the street The name Brogans Bar and
Grill is written in gold script on the storefront window

From the outside it looks like any other Bensonhurst bar

It was beautiful china

Monty leans back in his chair and surveys the place Not that
he hasnt’ seen the bar a thousand times— hes having a hard
time looking directly at his father

RUTH a waitress with a face like a crumpled paper bag
arrives with the food pork chops for the elder Brogan a

She rests her hand on Montys shoulder for a moment

overweight suburban dad But on closer inspection there is
something absolutely mirthless in his smile a meanness
around his eyes Hes in his late forties

board

Naturelle wheels around and Monty has to jump back to avoid
getting gutted by the carving knife

NATURELLE

with laughter Doyle a little confused licks Montys face

NATURELLE (CONTD)

mystified begins to bark and finally Naturelle starts

laughing too

Monty grabs her wrist and pulls her down on top of him She
drops the knife to the side and bites Monty hard oh the

Slattery and Jakob sit on bar stools Slattery sips froma

The Bug Bar gets its name from the exotic insects in glass
jars behind the bar A television above the bar shows the

Monty raises his glass and Slattery and Jakob grab their
glasses and raise them too

MONTY
Fuck Sunday

He drinks Slattery and Jakob hesitate and then follow suit

EXT VELVET — NIGHT

Monty steps out of a taxi followed by Slattery and Jakob A

roiling MOB occupies half the block crowding in front of the
ay entrance to the dance club

Most are teenagers They clot together in groups of fours and

fives smoking cigarettes and stomping their feet to keep

warm Almost none are dressed for the snow

MONTY
The whole city came out to say goodbye

SLATTERY

-Monty slips through the maze of boys and girls The kids look
at him as he walks by

Monty makes his way to the velvet ropes KHARI GREENE a

pillar of a man wearing the exact same camels hair coat as

Monty stands by the door checking names off a clipboard

Two pale scars run in parallel lines down Kharis left cheek
MONTY (CONTD)

Khari looks up from his clipboard and smiles He offers his
hand and they shake
KHARI

Montys shoulders

They shake hands and Monty signals for Slattery and Jakob to
follow him Monty slides through the crowd Slattery bulls
through lik-and a--f-ullback blocking for--his speedier—teammate

Jakob walks with a high degree of self-consciousness
nervously dodging arotind the various obstacles He passes one
stoned girl who stands with her head back catching
snowflakes in her mouth

MARY
Hey Elinsky Mr Elinsky Hey

Jakob freezes Her hand catches his sleeve and he is forced
to turn around forced to stare into the unnaturally bright
eyes of Mary DAnnunzio

She wears dark denim jeans a fake raccoon fur coat and no
hat Her wet black hair snakes across her forehead and neck
Black trails of eye shadow stain her cheeks

our bones

Mary opens her mouth and speaks but we might not be able to
hear it over the music

MARY

INT VELVET VIP ROOM — MOMENTS LATER

Monty leads Jakob and Mary into the VIP room Naturelle is
already there speaking with Slattery

The walls of the VIP room are covered with crushed red
velvet The couches are upholstered in red velvet the small
bar in the corner is draped with red velvet the carpet is
red faux velvet

DJ Dusks music pours from speakers bolted into the corners
His beats are impossible to sit still for incorporating
elements of bossa nova techno hip hop and jazz

Slattery has a hard time keeping his eyes off Naturelle His
gaze tends to slide her way and his desire for her is
apparent to everyone

Naturelle smiles when she sees Monty and goes to him She
looks beautiful in-the silver dress -Gehugs him Monty
stands awkwardly in her embrace

When she realizes hes not returning the hug she quickly
releases him Hes watching her carefully She sees Jakob and
smiles at him

NATURELLE
Hey Jake

She hugs Jakob Mary has not stopped dancing since first
hearing Dusks mix

NATURELLE (CONTD)
(looking at Mary)
Is this your friend

JAKOB

Smashing Pumpkins were in here -

She turns and examines Monty more closely

MARY (CONTD)
Who are you Are you somebody famous

MONTY
Do us a favor DAnnunzio Dont talk too
much

Mary grins tears off her fake fur coat and hides it
underneath a sofa She wears a white tank-top with Tweety
Bird emblazoned on the front Tweety Bird looks scared

DAPHNE a young waitress in a green dress comes over with a
tray of champagne flutes Naturelle kisses Daphne on the
cheek and the two women exchange greetings Everyone takes a
glass

MONTY (CONTD)
(raising his glass)
Champagne for my real friends real pain

Everyone takes aand sip except for Mary who guzzles hers in one
giant gulp then belches and wipes her mouth with the back of
her hand Jakob stares at her horrified

MARY
Anyone want to go dance

Naturelle glances at Monty

MONTY
Do what you want to do

Jakob and Slattery hear the coldness in Montys voice and are
surprised by it

Ss Kostya walks down the staircase that leads from the catwalk
to the dance floor and disappears into the crowd For a while
neither Monty nor Slattery speaks °
Then Slattery looks at Monty and notices his eyes are closed

wildly on a platform

MONTY (CONTD)
Our friend Jake has picked himself a

INT VELVET VIP ROOM — LATER

The room is beginning to crowd with Montys friends and
acquaintances Jakob sits alone on the sofa sipping
champagne He clearly recognizes no one

ringed fists Lean women stand in clusters heads bowed
together We hear snippets of banter in four different
languages oe

Jakob dips his head against the sofas velvet armrest Hes

clearly exhausted He begins slipping into sleep

The men standing nearby turn to

Mary walks into the room
Mary sees

look at her then whisper to each other and laugh
Jakob curled up on the sofa and dances over to him

She pulls off his Yankees cap and puts it on her own head
where it sits crookedly She climbs on top of him her knees
straddling his chest and bends close to whisper in his ear
MARY
Jakey Jakey

Gee

O She runs her fingernail down his side Jakob half-sleeping
smiles and caresses her hand Then his eyes pop open He
jerks upright and Mary slides off him

JAKOB
Whoa what are you doing What are you

Mary now standing and slightly swaying laughs

MARY
Dont panic Nobody here gives a shit

JAKOB
I give a shit Do you know what happens

Mary sits on the far side of the sofa knees primly clasped
together exaggerating the role of good girl

MARY

JAKOB

JAKOB

Jakob says nothing for a moment but he cant resist

Mary is watching three women dancing in the middle of the
room their purses flung down on the floor between them

JAKOB

Mary turns to look at him again but its clear shes not

MARY

She springs up from the sofa and takes three steps back then
begins staggering toward Jakob hands folded over her gut
covering her invisible sword wound

MARY (CONTD)
Exchange forgiveness with me noble
Hamlet Mine and my fathers death come
not upon thee nor thine on me

She collapses onto the red sofa and lies there quivering for
a moment before going still

A group of men smoking cigars in the corner claps loudly

Jakob stares down at the prone Mary He cannot help noticing
the stretch of pale skin between the dark denim of her
waistband and the white cotton of her tank top

Mary sits up and brushes some stray hairs under the Yankees
cap

MARY (CONTD)
Its bettex with the fake blood

JAKOB
No it was very good

MARY
Ms Taylor says Im the best dier shes

( )

MARY
You think my mother gives a shit Anyway

snow day for sure

JAKOB
I need to go to sleep

Mary lies back on the sofa and kicks her feet in the air She
begins a bicycling motion her hands behind her head

MARY
Cant sleep yet Hes turning it on

Jakob looks at her slender pale ankles He covers his eyes
Mary rolls off the sofa

MARY (CONTD)
Is there a bathroom in here

Jakob points

JAKOB
Over there I think

Mary winks at him and makes her way across the room En route
she grabs a champagne flute off Daphnes platter and chugs
it She replaces the glass and slips into the bathroom

Jakob watches her go He watches the bathroom door close
behind her He stands a bit unsteadily Hes been drinking
all night He weaves his way to the bathroom door

He waits Eventually Mary opens the door She looks up at
Jakob hereyes as wide as Tweety Birds

MARY
You need to pee

JAKOB
No

He presses forward backing her up and closes the door
behind him

INT VIP BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS
The bathroom is blue-walled and lit by a single blue bulb

MARY
Hi

( )

Her teeth glow in the blue light Jakob grabs her by the
shoulders and kisses her hard on the mouth His hands begin
to move down from her shoulders—

-—and then abruptly Jakob pulls back He stares at Mary
who stares at the floor She looks stunned the Yankees cap
sitting crookedly on her head

Jakob stumbles backward He tries to say something but cant
get the words out

He turns ard rams through the bathroom door
INT VELVET VIP ROOM — CONTINUOUS

He shoves past cigar smokers and dancing women He runs from
the VIP room

The partiers watch him go and then turn to look at the
bathroom a drop of blue in the overwhelming redness of the
VIP room

Mary stands in the blue light still looking at the floor

INT WHITE ROOM — LATER

The White Room got its name for obvious reasons Everything
is white the shag carpet the walls the overstuffed
furniture

Monty sits on a large white bean bag in a corner of the room
He holds a champagne bottle in one hand and takes occasional

sips

MARGUERITE a beautiful prostitute in her early twenties
kneelsin front of Monfcyhe rbands onhis Jfchighs 7

Monty passes her the bottle and she takes a long draught
never taking her eyes off him She hands back the bottle and
unzips his fly taking her time with everything

Monty leans back and closes his eyes We watch him like this
for a few seconds and then we

CUT TO

EXT CARL SCHURZ PARK PLAYGROUND — AFTERNOON

Springtime Monty sits on a park bench This is several years
ago and he looks younger less exhausted

( )
86

He is watching two high school girls on the swings One
blonde— LINDSAY JAMISON-— and one brunette— a younger
Naturelle

Both girls wear the uniform of their private school white
blouses embroidered with the schools initials and green
plaid skirts over black tights

Both girls are smoking But while Lindsay keeps the cigarette
clenched in-one hand as she swings higher Naturelle
continues taking reckless drags the crook of her elbow
holding the chain lightly as she soars skyward

Monty stands and approaches the swings The girls pretend not
to notice him

MONTY
Hey

The girls keep swinging

MONTY (CONTD)
Could I bum a smoke

NATURELLE
What
MONTY
A smoke
NATURELLE

This is my last one
Lindsay brakes with her feet and stares at Monty

LINDSAY
Ive met you before havent I

Monty nods slowly Its obvious he doesnt recognize her but
he doesnt want to be rude

MONTY
Yeah you look familiar

Naturelle has stopped swinging now Lindsay jumps off her
swing

LINDSAY
I know who you are Come on Nat weve
got practice

MONTY
You know who I am Who am I

( )

Lindsay picks up her bookbag and strides quickly away
looking back once or twice to see if Naturelle is following

Naturelle is not following

MONTY (CONTD)

MONTY

swinging a little

MONTY

‘things

‘She starts swinging ‘digain and™ he’ watches the’ her long black

CUT TO

INT WHITE ROOM

Montys eyes are still closed Now he opens them His hands
are in Marguerites hair but now they drop by his side

Finally he taps Marguerite on the shoulders She backs away

from him looking up at his face for a moment before blinking
and licking her lips

( )

MONTY
Its my fault Youre very beautiful

He hands her the bottle again and she takes a long sip

MARGUERITE
(Colombian accent)
You are very handsome Are you an actor

Monty zips his fly

MONTY
Yeah Ima star

INT CLUB ROOM — LATER

The club room is decorated to look like the library of an
English country manor dark wood paneling bookshelves
stacked with leather-bound books flickering sconce lights

Slattery sits on a stool at the bar rolling a glass of
whiskey between his palms His eyes are red from crying or
exhaustion or both

Naturelle walks into the room and spots Slattery She goes
over to him and squeezes the back of his neck before sitting
on the neighboring stool He sits up straight and smiles

NATURELLE
Why are you all alone

SLATTERY
I couldnt sit in that goddamn red room
anymore I dont know anyone in there
noes These are Monty’s friends—

NATURELLE
I guess so Theyre around a lot anywayv

Slattery drains his whiskey He signals for another and the

bartender pours it Hes clearly getting drunk though
Slattery is aman who can handle his liquor He checks his
watch

SLATTERY
Im supposed to be at work in a couple
hours Christ I cant even imagine

NATURELLE

She stands and smooths out the wrinkles in her silver dress
Again Slattery has to turn away from the sight of her

They stop outside the offioe and knock on the steel-plated

TAFAYEV a balding man smoking a cigarette “opens
the door and closes it behind him He nods
Monty and Kostya pull out their guns and hand them to him
Checking the safeties he shoves the guns under his belt and
cigarette clenched between his teeth carefully pats both-men
down

When Mustafayev finishes searching them he raps on the door
and it opens again He gestures and Monty and Kostya enter

INT VELVET MANAGERS OF FICE— CONTINUOUS

Mustafayev follows them inside hands their guns to one of
the ZAKHAROV twins and goes back outside closing the door

The twins are Russian redheads who speak very little English
Their faces are blunted and pitiless

Uncle Blue sits behind Volandes desk reading the paper
Valghobek sits on a corner of the desk

The twin with the guns places them carefully in front of
Uncle Blue then returns to stand by his brother both of
them standing behind Monty and Kostya

DJ Dusks music can barely be heard down here the thump of
bass and drum sounding like distant bombshells

Uncle Blue folds his paper neatly and sets it aside

UNCLE BLUE

MONTY
Its all right Thanks for setting it up

UNCLE BLUE

The first time I went to prison I was
fourteen years old a skinny little boy

to my hometown I found my mother I
kissed her And she screamed

She did not recognize me I have been in
three different prisons Montgomery in
three different countries You know what

Monty shakes his head and waits

VALGHOBEK

Monty waits

VALGHOBEK

Uncle Blue turns Montys gun in his hands He checks the
slides action He ejects the magazine peers at the top

Monty turns again The Zakharov twins have their automatics
out Monty getting desperate turns back to Uncle Blue

MONTY
I never said a word to anyone They came
after me to get to you I know it you
know it They dont care about me But I
never said a word

Uncle Blue makes a gesture and the Zakharovs frighteningly
fast spring forward slamming Kostya to the floor and
holding-their pistols to his skull

I believe you Montgomery When you get
there figure out who is who Find a man
nobody is protecting a man without
people And beat him until his eyes
bleed

Monty stares at Kostya who whimpers on the ground blood
dripping from his nose

UNCLE BLUE (CONTD)

crazy but respectful too respectful of
the right men

UNCLE BLUE

MONTY

UNCLE BLUE
Kostya dimed you out little brother He
made a call and stole seven years from
your life

VALGHOBEK
They put the clamps on him and instead
of being a man about it taking the time
himself he sold you out

Uncle Blue hands Valghobek Montys pistol Valghobek walks
over to Monty and offers it to him

MONTY
I dont want it

UNCLE BLUE
Its yours You know how to use it

Valghobek holds the pistol by the barrel a small smile on
his face until Monty grabs it from him

MONTY
I know how to use it

UNCLE BLUE

He betrayed you he betrayed me He stole
from you He stole seven years from you
End him

Monty flicks off the safety and presses the muzzle against
Kostyas skull

Everyone in the room is quiet watching

The only sound is DJ Dusks mix an accelerating industrial
heartbeat

VALGHOBEK

Kostya weeps softly his big body shuddering

Uncle Blue face impassive behind his heavy beard watches
carefully

ZAKHAROV
He is cockroach Kill him

Montys face is very close to Kostyas

MONTY
(quietly)
You were my friend

KOSTYA

Monty closes his eyes

When he opens his eyes he flicks the safety back on He
stands

He tosses the gun to Uncle Blue who catches it and frowns

« MONTY
It doesnt matter to me Not a goddamn
thing matters tome except this if you
hurt my father Ill kill you both

The Zakharov twins grab Monty and hold him Monty doesnt
struggle he and Uncle Blue stare at each other

Uncle Blue drums the desktop with his fingers Everyone
waits A glass of water on the table trembles from the
distant bass

Finally Uncle Blue nods at Valghobek who opens the office
door The twins release Monty Everyone (except for Kostya
who is face down on the floor) watches him

Monty walks out of the room never looking back

EXT 14TH STREET — LATER

Monty trudges down the sidewalk followed by Slattery and
Jakob The snow continues to fall and lies thickly drifted
on the crookedly-parked cars on the parking meters on the
spears of the church gate they pass

They reach the Union Square subway station and walk down the
stairs disappearing from our view

CLOSE ON FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW

We slowly follow their path backward In the yellow shine of
the streetlights the footprints fill with snow until finally
(the camera still moving backward) they disappear

INT UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION

Monty Frank and Jakob sit with their backs against the
“corrugated shutters of a closed newspaper stand

An OLD MAN wearing a garbage bag with a hole cut out for his
head leans against a blue I-beam that helps support the
ceiling He holds a small radio to his ear we can hear
fragments of Puerto Rican Jibaro music

Jakob chews on his fingernails He cranes his neck to look
down the subway tunnel— still no train in sight He looks at

Monty

JAKOB
What time is it

But Monty is jnot present he is elsewhere lost in whatever
£6VeFie occupleshis mind Slatteryseyes’ are’ ‘closedj-he-

Another long pause

MONTY
Its getting late

The lights of the train come around the bend in the tunnel

INT 4 TRAIN — LATER

The three men sit side by side as the train shudders through
the darkness Slattery seems to be sleeping again Jakob
stares at his reflected face in the far window

Monty pulls out his wallet and finds the photograph that his
father gave him earlier in the night

INSERT PHOTO

Monty in his firemans helmet standing before his parents

EXT MONTYS BUILDING— NIGHT

Monty Slattery and Jakob wade through the snow to the stoop
steps

INT MONTYS BUILDING

They climb the narrow staircase their footfalls echoing off
the tiled walls

INT MONTYS APARTMENT

They enter the apartment Doyle is excited to see them he
pants and spins in little circles sniffing at their boots

Jakob and Slattery fall onto the sofa and lie there like
corpses

Monty opens the bedroom door steps inside and closes it
behind him

INT— MONTYS BEDROOM

Naturelle ‘sleeps on her side - facing the window ‘Monty kneels
beside her and takes her hand Her eyes open She smiles for
a second and then quickly sits up

NATURELLE
What time is it

Both of them turn to look at the digital clock on the
nightstand

Naturelle waits as Monty stares down at the bed

He kisses her again a last fierce kiss and heads for the’
door

INT MONTYS LIVING ROOM

Monty grabs the leash off the back of the apartment door and
clips it to Doyles collar

MONTY
Let me take one more walk with Doyle

Slattery and Jakob nod Both are exhausted
C EXT EAST END AVENUE LATER

The snow has finally stopped falling

( )

ear tee

The parked cars lining the avenue look like scoops of vanilla
ice cream glistening below the streetlights The awnings of
the buildings fringed with icicles creak beneath the weight

of the snow

Doyle off his leash charges down the middle of the avenue
carving a trail through the foot-deep powder a drop of ink
rolling down a blank page

Monty follows behind twirling circles with the leash
Slattery and Jakob bring up the rear slogging through the

Snow like weary soldiers

The only vehicle on the road is a snow plow half a mile
south its yellow lights flashing

EXT CARL SCHURZ PARK

They cross into the park past the fenced-in gingko trees
climbing the stairs that lead to the esplanade

Doyle spies a squirrel and chases after it but the squirrel
is quicker makes it to a red maple and scrambles up the

‘trunk to safety
Doyle squats at the foot of the tree staring sadly up
through the branches

EXT EAST RIVER ESPLANADE
Across the river is Queens and Queens before sunrise is
beautiful red antennae lights winking to warn pilots the

Pepsi sign glowing in neon script over the bottling plant
white clouds rising from the smokestacks like genies

Behind Queens the-sky is beginning to brighten -—
Jakob brushes snow off the iron balustrade leans against it

and ‘stares into the river’ A string of yellowlights quivers
beneath the waters reflections from the Queensboro Bridge

A red tugboat chugs south

MONTY
It would be good to work a tugboat Be
out on the river all day

He turns to face Jakob

MONTY (CONTD)
So what do you think You ready for Mr
Doyle

Jakob looks at Doyle who is rolling on his back in the snow
kicking his feet in the air like a puppy

JAKOB
He likes the snow

Monty whistles for Doyle and the dog jumps to his feet and
runs over wagging the stump of his tail his muzzle dusted
with snow

MONTY
I need a favor Frank

SLATTERY °
Anything

Monty refastens the leash onto the dogs collar and ties the
cord around a baluster knotting it twice checking to make
sure its secure

MONTY
Im not going in there like this The
minute they get a look at me Im gone

Monty straightens up and looks directly into Slatterys eyes

MONTY (CONTD)
Make me ugly

Slattery looks dumbfounded He turns to glance at Jakob who
is equally confused

Monty clears the snow off the nearest bench unbuttons his
camels hair coat and lays it down

MONTY (CONTD)
You just said youd do anything So this
is what I need-

SLATTERY
I cant do that What are you thinking I
give you a black eye and people wont
fuck with you It wont change anything
Monty steps closer

SLATTERY
All right All right

He turns stiffly and walks away

JAKOB
Come on Come on Monty what are you
doing Tell him youre kidding

Monty pivots and punches Jakob hard on the cheek the crack
of gloved knuckle on bone echoing on the empty esplanade

Jakob falls back against the balustrade clutching his face

JAKOB (CONTD)
MontyI

Monty steps closer and punches Jakob again this time in the
gut and Jakob sinks to his knees gasping He covers his
face with his hands to protect himself

Slattery tackles Monty pinning him to the ground

For a moment everything is still Doyle leashed to the
baluster whines unsure if his master is playing or
fighting

Jakob stunned by the violence ‘watches Slattery stares at
Monty and Monty stares back All of them in the snow their
breath coiling and rising into the sky

Finally Slattery looks away looks past the East River past
Queens He clenches his eyes shut Whenhe opens them we see
the first tears forming

Slattery grabs Montys throat with his left hand and punches

him in the face with his right again and again and again

Doyle howls He tries to jump on Slattery but the leash keeps
yanking him back He strains forward fangs bared but his
master is three feet too far

Jakob touches his cheek and examines his fingers no blood

Doyle barking madly keeps jumping for Slattery keeps being
yanked back by the leash

Jakob grabs hold of the balustrade and pulls himself to his
feet

JAKOB (CONTD)
Frank Frank - - coc ups

The blood puddles by Montys head melting through the snow
and steaming in the air Slattery lost in his anger his
frustration continues swinging

Jakob stumbles over to Slattery and pushes him

JAKOB (CONTD)
Stop

Slattery looks up his face wet with tears a webbing of
saliva between his lips

JAKOB (CONTD)
Okay Enough

Jakob grabs the big man under the armpits and helps him rise

Slattery looks down at Monty who is not moving

SLATTERY
Oh Jesus

Jakob crouches and turns Monty onto his stomach Monty
coughs a thick ribbon of blood falling from his mouth

Jakob scoops up a handful of snow and begins gently pressing
it to Montys brutalized face

Doyle continues to bark the collar digging into his throat
as he struggles to reach his master

Slattery watches speechless his bloodied hands by his side

Finally Monty shakes his head clear of the snow and begins
crawling forward

JAKOB
Hold still for a minute-Hold still

When Monty tries to stand his legs collapse beneath him
Jakob wraps his arms around him before he falls and lowers
him to the snow

JAKOB (CONTD)
Dont try to move yet

Monty pushes himself off the ground again and this time
manages to keep his balance though he sways like a drunk

MONTY

(slurring)
Its okay

Blood leaks from his nose from his mouth from a deep gash
bisecting one eyebrow The entire left side of his face is

He walks over to Slattery who sits in the snow sobbing
Monty leans over and kisses his forehead

Slattery rocks back and forth hands over his face his
forehead marked with blood

Monty turns to Jakob and touches his shoulder

MONTY (CONTD)

Jakob is stunned by whats happened in the last few minutes

He has no idea what to say

EXT MONTYS BUILDING — DAWN

Naturelle in her down parka sits on the stoop steps She
sees him when hes a block away and we see him from that
distance limping through the snow

Naturelle stands and breathes in deeply She starts walking
toward him but stops after a few steps She can see his face
now

His eyes are so badly swollen that he doesnt notice her
until hes almost upon her When he does see her he smiles
and Naturelle has to look away for a moment

He tries to say something but chokes leans over hands on
his knees and spits up blood

Naturelle takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps
INT MONTYS LIVING ROOM

He sits on the sofa while Naturelle dabs at his face with a
wet washcloth A bowl of soapy water sits beside her on the
coffee table

When she wrings the washcloth above the bowl drops of blood
fall into the water and bloom

MONTY
I dont want you to visit

His voice is rough and slurred his split lip impeding his
diction

She opens a bottle of rubbing alcohol wets a cotton ball
presses the cottpn lightly against the gash in his forehead

He shudders his fingers gripping the edges of the sofa

cushions

MONTY (CONTD)

continues cleaning his wounds

NATURELLE
Wait a second

She goes to the kitchen and Monty rocks back and forth on his
bootheels When she returns she holds a plastic bag filled
with ice cubes

She makes him hold the bag against the side of his face They
dont move for a moment her hand on top of his hand the bag
of ice pressed to his jaw
