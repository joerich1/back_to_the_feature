EXT SEWER TUNNEL -- NIGHT

An archway at the end of an alley Broken and bent long
ago crusted with moss A trickle of water cuts through

A SCREAM from within Laboured BREATHING the rapid SPLISH
SPLASH of footfalls

AISLING COBWEB beautiful and intense bursts from the tunnel
into the narrow alley

Her body petite young and frail tense with fear From
her back sprout a pair of large moth-like wings fragile
intricate frayed at the edges

Aisling Cobweb is a faerie And shes running for her life

She catches her tattered skirt on metal grating and stumbles
face first She turns panicked

In the darkness distant at first an eerie WAIL Her eyes
widen

Aisling flexes her wings and takes to
THE AIR

with frantic agility She flies weaving between narrow
alleys dodging gas lanterns and sagging clothes-lines

Her papery wings carry her swerving around tight corners
She slams into the side of a steep inclined

ROOF

where she scrambles for a foothold on the slate -shingles
A black clawed hand grabs her ankle

she ‘kicks free and makes it to the pinnacle of the roof
‘She leaps flaps her wings and climbs again into

THE NIGHT SKY

Above the rooftops

Ahead of her through the thick billowing feg she sees the
obscure shape” of a tower bridge She heads for the nearest’

TOWER

and alights at the top between two gargoyles Wincing she

“stretches her wings She hugs her knees and shivers

She cautiously looks out over the city gas lights diffused
through the thick night fog She looks down towards the
river No sign of her pursuer

No sound except the river LAPPING against the moorings of
the bridge far below and nearby doves COOING softly

In a fluttering whirlwind the doves suddenly scatter

Aisling looks around She dares not breath

Suddenly A DARK SHAPE swoops in and snatches her from her
perch Aislings piercing screams echo in the night as the
struggling pair melts into the murky fog

Rasping HISSES the CRACKING of bones and a ravenous wet
SUCKING noise Her screams dwindle to a hoarsed MOAN

Like a rag doll Aisling falis through the fog limp her
wings raggedly shorn from her body She lands in

THE RIVER
with a sickening SLAP

Her violated corpse floats face down drifting with the
current trailing a sparkling rainbow viscus of faerie blood

Somewhere in the distance a FOGHORN sounds
TO BLACK
EXT THE BURGUE (AERIAL VIEW) -- MORNING -

An urban hodgepodge of crumbling rooftops grimy belfries
and smoke-stained spires Chimneys and smokestacks pump
towers of soot into a stone gray sky

CARD OVER City of the Burgue

PHILOSTRATE (V0)
The Burgue city of soot and sorcery
city of humang and monsters of faerie
whores and drug peddling dwarves

(NOTE Labels and borders show various zones of the city
as each area is introduced)

PHILOSTRATE (V0) (CONTD)
In the Bast you have Argyle Heights
the academic district In the ‘North
The Docklands center of industry
and shipping where the Selkies the
seal folk work the barges
(MORE)
PHILOSTRATE (VO) (CONTD)
In the West Carnival Row the faerie

quarter home of the sordid faerie
brothels In the South Finistere
Crossing the human zone Thats
where I live All the underground
train lines lead to the center of
town Oberon Square

(NOTE Lines snake out from the center of the map and

become underground railways)

PHILOSTRATE (V0) (CONTD)

where the human controlled
government sits and spins its web
like a big goddamned spider

The web becomes a map painted on the wall of

INT UNDERGROUND TRAIN STATION -- CONTINUOUS -

INSPECTOR RYCROFT PHILOSTRATE leans against the wall next to -

the map He has a hard face but kind eyes
long coat and black bowler hat and smokes a

PHILOSTRATE (V0)

He wears a
pipe

And thats The Burgue for you A to
zed a melting pot just a few degrees

£xom boiling over

He reads a letter as he waits for the train

PHILOSTRATE (V0) (CONTD)
Sometimes I can make myself forget

about the whole mess

He holds it up to an oil lamp bolted to the wall to read the

beautifully calligraphed handwriting

Asoft smile crosses his face
EXT TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

Barreling through a tunnel pistons pumping
pipes spewing plumes of steam-

It comes into the gaslit subterranean station
in front of Philostrate The passenger doors
He steps off into the car

INT PASSENGER CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Philostrate sits crammed shoulder to shoulde

wheels spinning

and stops right
slide open

r with similarly

dressed COMMUTERS in the dim car He wipes the sweat from

his brow with a handkerchief

The darkness of the tunnel outside is interrupted by regular
strobes of track-lights

A bit of the graffiti on the windows catches Philostrates
eye The words The Screaming Banshee next to -the crude
drawing of a ghost mouth agape

The strobing track-lights illuminate the haunting picture in
brief flashes Philostrate stares inte the hollow eyes of
the drawing as the train SCREAMS to a stop

EXT OBERON SQUARE LATER »

Philostrate ascends the stairs of the underground station
out into a plaza of crumbling marble sculptures

He walks past TOURISTS feeding a thick flock of pigeons
The black dome of -Parliament looms in the distance

An OLD FAERIE with withered wings pushes a cart piled high
with trinkets Laughing SCHOOLBOYS sneak up behind her and
throw pigeon food at the her She totters to her knees

The boys scatter as Philostrate gives them a reproachful
look Philostrate moves to help the woman up

PHILOSTRATE
You alright

As she climbs to her feet the contents of her bag spill
Stacks of a rough home-made pamphlet printed on hard pulp
grain paper A banner reads The Screaming Banshee

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Dissident literature’ You know what
this is dont you This is an anti-
human rag

Philostrate scrutinizes one of the pamphlets then turns his
hard eyes on the old woman

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Do you have any ‘more

‘Without looking up she hands the rest over

’ Philostrate’ stuffs the papers into a nearby dustbin and tosses
4 lit-match in after them A small bonfire erupts

- PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Im sorry Just doing my job

1 A powerful well-dressed middle aged woman DAME WHITLEY
BONIFACE stands at a podium before a clutter of microphones
and wires Camera flashes shine in her fierce eyes

DAME
Today more than one third of this
city is Faerie Selkie or Puck

Her oratory echoes over the gathering throng of demonstrators -
FAERIES some HUMANS and OTHER CREATURES

DAME (CONTD)
Why does this same third represent
only 10 of the citys wealth —

A MURMUR from the crowd signs raised in approval

DAME (CONTD)
Why does this element endure such
civil injustice Heres the reason
How much representation have you in
Parliament

The crowd ROARS and WHISTLES

DAME (CONTD)
On We must reform the suffrage laws of
po our city But do not count on the
generosity of man Dont count on
my influence as the Mayors wife

INT PHILOSTRATES OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Philostrate looks over papers at his desk The Dames distant
voice drifts across the Square and through the open window

DAME (0S)
The right to vote is‘not ours to
give It is aright of birth Stand
and claim what is yours
A loud electric BUZZ startles Philostrate

PHILOSTRATE
Bollocks I just got here

He flips a switch on a small metal box bolted to the desk

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Philostrate

MAGISTRATE‘ FLUTEs voice flows from a brass horn mounted on
the ceiling above Philostrates head

Philostrate looks out the window

EXT CARRIAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

The COACH DRIVER feeds the Griffin from a burlap feed sack

Bottom paces Philostrate walks up

BOTTOM

Philostrate climbs in Bottom waddles after him

BOTTOM (CONTD)

He heaves himself

INSIDE THE CARRIAGE

and settles his bulk into the seat across from Philostrate
PHILOSTRATE

EXT STREET -- CONTINUOUS ©

The Coach Driver whips the reigns The animal breaks into a

trot pulling the carriagé down the narrow foggy street

INT CARRIAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Bottom sits wedged uncomfortably Fatty-jowls hang over his

tight coliar rippling as he speaks

BOTTOM
All Im saying - If you live among

PHILOSTRATE
Oh And you speak selkie do you

BOTTOM

Philostrate looks out the window into the cold bleak morning

PHILOSTRATE
No

EXT THE DOCKLANDS BEACH -- MORNING

Aisling Cobwebs corpse lies on the shore Her dress
shredded Her mouth frozen in a ghastly scream Two
CONSTABLES slide the body into a black bag

Philostrate looks over the fog-choked harbour watching
creatures move about the deck of a distant ship

PHILOSTRATE
Wheres the girl who found the body

BOTTOM
Names Moira Shes in her skin in
the water over there

A slick supple seal- esque creature emerges from the tide
-It climbs up onto a rock in the distance Stretching

contorting opening its mouth’ impossibly wide

BOTTOM (CONTD)
This bit still gives me the creeps

A human face pushes through the open mouth A whole head
emerges Curly red hair A hand An arm A shoulder
The girl underneath pulls off the dark sealskin as if shes
sliding out of a tight leather skirt

MOIRA stands on the rock in her human form completely
nude Slim fair-skinnied body flecked in a blizzard of Light
pink freckles Her ears Pointed like a faerie’ Ss

Philostrate politely turns away Bottom stares slack-jawed
with a mix of morbid fascination and disgust

EXT BOULDER ON THE BEACH -- MOMENTS LATER

Moira dresses herself from a heap of clothes strewn on the
rock Philostrate and Bottom approach

PHILOSTRATE
Good morning Miss Moira I’m
Inspector Philostrate -

She meets him with sharp eyes bright as emeralds Inhuman

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
You found the body did you

Moira nods She picks up the shed sealskin singing softly
as she pets it The soft pelt purrs back Bottom grimaces

BOTTOM
A separate creature is it

Another curt silent nod

PHILOSTRATE
Lets not waste the ladys time
to Moira)
You can feel free to talk Im not
fluent in selkie-speak but I can
muddle through

Finally she speaks ° Her language a song a dozen ‘voices
in one flowing eerie harmonies

MOTRA
Corpse caught in backwards currents
moth caught in the cobweb of creation
clipped wings plucked from silken ©
firmaments sticky strands clinging
sinister spider spinning poor poor
singless wingless pixie

BOTTOM
You want me to write this bilge down
(Philostrate nods
Oh fine

‘He takes out a notepad

PHILOSTRATB
What do you know about what did this

MOIRA
Breezes whisper through silent
streets tales of some unseelie beast
sublime song soundless to mens ears
becomes the swelling music of faeries
fears

Bottom transcribes furiously shaking his head in frustration

PHILOSTRATE
Thank you for your time miss

EXT THE DOCKLANDS BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
Philostrate and Bottom walk back to the carriage

BOTTOM
Waste of time Its all gibberish

PHILOSTRATE
You see thats why you have to come
to work in the uniform and I get to
wear whatever I want

BOTTOM
Alright then professor what did
you get out of all that nonsense

PHILOSTRATE
Theres something new in town
something the faeries are afraid of

They board the carriage
INT PHILOSTRATES OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON

Philostrate leafs through sepia tintypes of Aislings corpse
Bottom sits at the typewriter filling out a report

BOTTOM
The coroner cant even examine the
body til tomorrow morning

PHILOSTRATE
You just finish typing that report

BOTTOM
Bloody hell Shes a faerie and
shes dead Who cares

Philostrate ignores him Bottom rolls a new paper into the
typewriter

Namé Aisling Cobweb Age 17

Philostrate examines a photo of Aislings bare back Two

of Aislings neck a strange puncture wound on the jugular

Bottom stops typing He looks up at Philostrate

BOTTOM (CONTD)
Have you ever met a male faerie

PHILOSTRATE

PHILOSTRATE
That has to be the dumbest thing

BOTTOM
(resumes typing)
Inspector You dont get out much
The Quarter’s stréets stink of rutting
faeries and black magics

Philostrate comes to the last photo Aislings face
contorted with terror He dwells on it

BOTTOM (CONTD)

lot of ‘em off to the clink

EXT THE FAERIE QUARTER CARNIVAL ROW -- NIGHT

Clotted with life Svelte FAERIES fly over the streets

LE CHAMBRE DE MADAME MAB

stands tightly wedged in a row of buildings packed together
like sardines A web of warped wooden beams embedded in old

yellowed plaster hold the crooked thing up

Lithe winged silhouettes flutter behind closed curtains
From inside girlish giggles cries of passion sensual’ music

Philostrate stands in the street in front of the house He
draws his long black coat tightly around himself tips the
brim of his bowler walks up to the front door and into
THE LOBBY

where blood-red velvet tapestries line the walls Faeries
lounge seductively on chez lounges All eyes on Philostrate

He climbs the stairs treading lightly into the second story
hall Sounds of passion drift from every room he passes

He comes to a door marked Tourmaline La Roux He listens

Silence He slowly pushes the door open

INT TOURMALINES ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Philostrate stands in the open doorway and looks over the

small room A bed a modest dresser a nightstand

Scattered across the wall and floors paintings and ‘canvases
ef all sizes Mostly watercolors

TOURMALINE LA ROUX sits on a ‘short stool at an easel
painting back to the door She wears only an old flowing
cotton apron soiled with colorful paint stains

Her golden curls cascade down her delicate porcelain-white

shoulders vibrant wings absentmindedly flexing as she works

PHILOSTRATE
Dont move

TOURMALINE
doesnt turn)
You going to arrest me

PHTLOSTRATE
I just might

Tourmaline turns and smiles at the sight of Philostrate
She daintily runs to him but stops short of embracing

TOURMALINE
Oh I shouldnt E mean Id hate
to get paint all over your -

Philostrate suddenly pulls her to him and kisses her
passionately They part He smiles

PHILOSTRATE
I have plenty of suits

TOURMALINE
Still all things considered -

She pulls the drawstring in back of her apron It falls to
her ankles She presses up against Philostrate

TOURMALINE (CONTD)
I like it better this way

They kiss deeply as she awkwardly fumbles with the his shirt
She reaches up andturns the valve on an oil lamp Darkness

INT TOURMALINES ROOM -- -MOMENTS LATER

Silver moonlight Philostrate falls on the bed Tourmaline
climbs on top of him wings fluttering excitedly

TOURMALINE
I missed you so much

She holds him tight and rocks sliding up and down pushing
and pulling tenderly rubbing against him

He gingerly nibbles at the lobe of her pointed ear

Tourmaline shudders and stretches her wings covering the
bed She gasps as her wings shiver and flush with color

INT TOURMALINES ROOM -- MORNING

Sunlight streams Over Tourmalines naked body asleep on top
of the covers She opens her eyes -

Phtlostrate stands by the window putting on-his pants his
bare back to Tourmaline She quietly reaches over to her

nightstand taking a sketchpad and charcoal pencil

She sketches an oblivious Philostrate as he fixes on the
canvas on her easel -

An unfinished art nouveau poster of a faerie dancer Bubble
letters announce - Guinevere Cartier Her pale body and
swirling watercolour wings fade into rough pencil lines

TOURMALINE
I hope its the brush strokes and
not the tits youre admiring

PHILOSTRATE
This poster - one of your old ones

TOURMALINE
Guinevere Cartier - Im just touching
it up a bit for the Orpheum

PHILOSTRATE
And what have you got there

Tourmaline holds her pad to her chest in mock modesty
TOURMALINE
Just a still life darling A bowl
of fruit and a pitcher of water
Philostrate grins and puts on his tie

Tourmaline tosses the pad aside

She grabs his tie and pulls him to her kissing him

-Philostrate indulges for a moment but finally pulls away

PHILOSTRATE
Ive got to go

She ties the sheets around her and-gets out of bed She
moves behind Philostrate lacing her arms around his waist

TOURMALINE
What could possibly be more important

PHILOSTRATE
Now we agreed We dont

TOURMALINE

Philostrate simply smiles He sits to put on-his shoes

° PHI LOSTRATE

with faerie biology Any ideas

TOURMALINE
I thought I taught you everything

PHILOSTRATE
I was thinking of something a little
more academic

TOURMALINE

Argyle Heights Maybe someone in
‘tthe Natural History annex

PHILOSTRATE
Right Theres an idea

Philostrate puts on his coat and stands up to leave
Tourmaline stands opens her sheet and wraps it around the
both of them holding him tight in a linen cocoon She ‘gently
kisses his neck flexing her wings beguilingly

DAME
Dont be so bourgeois

MAYOR
This fetish of yours was far more
interesting when we werent married

DAME

MAYOR
Far as I can tell their art consists
mainly of spreading their legs

DAME
In their homeland the courtesans of
Tirnanog were considered artists

MAYOR
‘Well here theyre considered sluts
Welcome to the Burque

DAME
Im saying maybe you have little
reason to be so haughty about the
art of love-making

‘The Mayor slams the newspaper on the table and looks up
DAME CONTD)
Shes not a slut Shes a singer
and a dancer

MAYOR -
Well that is a rare distinction

DAME

The Mayor smirks He gives her a patronizing nod
MAYOR

DAME
Theyre our poets painters
musicians and yes our sluts as you
so drolly put it

MAYOR
Your little dilettante committee can
have your pixie show dear

They round the corner and enter
THE MAIN VESTIBULE

FLUTE (CONTD)
Its clear this time our man wanted
to make an impression -

A withered corpse hangs from the cage Arms spread-eagle
wrists impaled on the cages spikes crucifixion-style head
lolled over to one side exposing gaping neck wounds

FLUTE (CONTD)
They found her right as the stations
Opened Shes Marguerite Mignon

Philostrate paces in front of the hanging corpse He spots
a crumpled wet flyer on the ground He picks it up

FLUTE (CONTD)
Considering the precision of the
work we figured she was already
dead by the time he strung her up

ON THE FLYER

in Philostrates hands Watercolour faeries in carnival
Masques dancing A signature reveals it to be Tourmalines

Philostrate looks back up to Margquerites corpse Her face
contorted with pain

PHILOSTRATE
Or too weak to fight back

Philostrate unsettled crumples the flyer and pockets it

Bottom laughs inappropriately at the sight of the Constable
wrestling with the limp corpse

FLUTE

BOTTOM
(stifling laughter)

Sorry sir

HARUSPEX Quiet All of you

A silence falls over the vestibule All eyes turn toward
the entrance where a hunched figure the HARUSPEX stands
silhouetted by shafts of morning sunlight

She hobbles into the room an old cxone frazzled gray hair
bandaged eyes behind black Spectacles A dark’ cloak flows
behind her She leans on a crooked walking stick

RARUSPEX (CONTD)
You pollute the aether with your
banal-thoughts

She approaches slowly and deliberately the hollow echo of
her wooden cane on the stone tiles stabs at the silence

PHILOSTRATE
(whispers to Flute)
The Haruspex

Flute gives a curt wordless nod-

HARUSPEX
Dependence on soothsayers Magistrate
will atrophy your inspectors

She throws Philostrate a wry grin Hes met only by his own
twin reflections in her black eyeglasses

She kneels with great difficulty next to the body

She wraps her spindly fingers around its face the veins on
her bony hands pulsate taut as wires

‘ HARUSPEX (CONTD)
Oh yes This one has things to tell
She has secrets in her little head

FLUTE
Would you be adverse to coming down
to Ops to conduct your reading

HARUSPEX
This is bound to be interesting

FLUTE
(to Philostrate)
You need a ride

PHILOSTRATE
No thanks Im heading up to Argyle
Heights -to follow up on atip —

INT ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (LOBBY) -- LATER

Suspended from a skylight hangs the fossilized skeleton of a
gigantic winged dragon mid-swoop an imposing centerpiece

Below a throng of uniformed SCHOOL CHILDREN point and gawk
at the bones as their CHAPERONES struggle to organize them

Philostrate enters via a set of revolving doors He crosses
the gleaming marble floor emblazoned with the museums seal
and goes to a large oak reception desk under the dragon

PHILOSTRATE
-Inspector Philostrate to see a
Professor Leopold Alcandre I wired
ahead 7

The Receptionist looks past Philostrate and nods

ALCANDRE (0S)
Ah Inspector

Philostrate- turns PROFESSOR LEOPOLD ALCANDRE an eccentric —
live wire of an old man waddles up

He wears oversized spectacles with extra lenses of various

‘magnifications He exudes a sort of constant enthusiasm

stumbling over words and occasionally chuckling to himself

He juggles a large leather instrument bag as he awkwardly

reaches to shake Philostrates hand
ALCANDRE (CONTD)

Forgive mé I just got your message

Ive hardly had a chance to drop by

my office Shall we

And hes gone before Philostrate can even get a word in

Under the dragons skeleton Alcandre calis after Philostrate

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Impressive isnt she Inspector
Draconis ferox Hard to believe
they once ruled the skies

Philostrate pauses a moment to look into the gaping jaws of
the fossilized beast

INT ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (BASEMENT) -- LATER

A long narrow dark passage Alcandre opens a door at the
end and enters Philostrate stands behind him

ALCANDRE
Of course faerie physiology is one
of my areas of expertise But only
one

He turns a knob With a GENTLE HISS a bank of gaslights
along the wall flares to life illuminating the corridor

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
I dabble in so many fields

PHILOSTRATE
I just have a féw questions

Alcandre reaches the door to his office and fumbles with his —
large key ring He finds the proper key disengages the

lock and pushes the door open with a rusty creak

INT ALCANDRES OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

A large musty room with high ceilings cluttered bookshelves

detailed charts and cross-sections of faerie anatomy

Alcandre tosses his keys on a table and squints into the
hazy shadows of the office Philostrate enters behind
ALCANDRE
Rupert Where are you Rupert

Philostrate notices light pink flower petals on a shelf near
his head He picks up the petals and curiously sniffs them

Suddenly something not entirely unlike a cat jumps down on
the shelf next to Philostrates head and hisses

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
There you are Rupert

Alcandre takes the creature in his arms

Small leaves pink blossoms and other foliage ‘sprout
sporadically from its green skin Its tail a leafy vine
whips casually back and forth as Alcandre strokes its head

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Ruperts a wee pet project of mine
Ha How do you like that Pet
project One of my many -
‘extracurricular dabblings Inspector
Ever heard of theurgic amalgamology

Philostrate shakes his head still trying to wrap his thoughts
around the puzzling catplant creature in Alcandres arms

PHILOSTRATE
I imagine you get this a lot -
ALCANDRE
Laymans terms
PHILOSTRATE
Afraid so
ALCANDRE

The manipulation of biology through
advanced technology and ancient
magics Commonly called twining

PHILOSTRATE
Oh twining yes Very controversial

ALCANDRE
Every new science ig Rupert here
is a cat twined with --

Alcandre plucks ared fruit from Ruperts skin The cat
MEWS harshly leaps from his arms and darts into the shadows
-Aleandre turns the red fruit ‘over in his fingers and grins

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
- a cherry tree

He pops it in his mouth and chews thoughtfully

PHILOSTRATE

Professor I need to know if you can

think of anything that feeds on faerie
blood

ALCANDRE
This wouldnt have anything to do
with Unseelie Jack now would it

Philostrate nods

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
How exciting Ive never been asked
to consult on Constabulary business

PHILOSTRATE
Any ideas

ALCANDRE
Well faerie blood is notoriously
toxic They do have a few natural
predators in their native Timanog
But Im talking about flesh-eaters
not blood-suckers

PHILOSTRATE
No chance of a breed of vampire -

ALCANDRE
Faerie blood would burn a hole in a
vampires gut faster than holy water

PHILOSTRATE
Would there be any reason to siphon
a faeries blood

Well there are old wives tales
Mostly hogwash The Sélkies say
faerie blood can be a potent
aphrodisiac Some Eastern legends
say its a cure for werewolfism
And there are some Elvish gypsies
who still believe it could be somehow “
- txeated or diluted into a psychotropic
‘ drug that promotes visions Hogwash

PHILOSTRATE a
So if Im getting thisright the
only living thing that could stand a
stomach full of faerie blood is -

END MONTAGE
INT LE CHAMBRE DE MADAME MAB (LOBBY) -- MOMENTS LATER

Philostrate moves down the hall to Tourmalines room Her
door closed and locked He hears MUFFLED MOANS of ecstasy

Philostrate backs away from the door

The MOANS become girlish SQUEALS of delight shuddering as
if in a vain attempt to be held back

Philostrate grits his teeth tries not to listen

The tittering SQUEALS become relentless SCREAMS of pleasure
The rhythmic POUNDING of the headboard against the wall

Philostrate slams his fist into the wall The door across
the hall opens A DAINTY FAERIE peers out into the hallway

DAINTY
Aw if your girls busy squire I

can fill in I guess youd be’ the
one doin’ the fillin in though

She smiles giggling at her pun Philostrate glares at her
DAINTY (CONTD)
No Fine then You just keep your
trousers on and behave yourself until
shes finished alright

She shuts her door

From Tourmalines room emerges a swarthy man BARABBAS

braided beard tangled dreads He fastens his trousers

Barabhas winks at Philostrate and pushes ‘past

INT TOURMALINES ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Tourmaline pulls on a delicate slip as Philostrate steps
into the doorway She turns and smiles

TOURMALINE
Oh Philo I didnt expect to see
you so early love

PHTLOSTRATE
Well I was in the neighborhood what
with the hunt for the serial killer

TOURMALINE
Yes Ugly business - all that

She goes to him and wraps her arms tightly around him He
dismissively pats her on the back and pulls away

PHILOSTRATE
Speaking of ugly business I dont
suppose that surly chap was just
digging for pirates gold in here

TOURMALINE co
I know Im so sorry love I
never intended for you te cross paths
He was just a client Completely
harmless Safe as houses

PHILOSTRATE
He looked rather like a wanted poster
waiting to happen -

TOURMALINE

PHILOSTRATE
Come now a good half of that bark
was yours

TOURMALINE a
‘Weve talked about this Its all

She ‘reassuringly kisses Philostrate on the neck and whispers

TOURMALINE (CONTD)
You get the real thing
26
Philostrate pushes her away a little too hard

TOURMALINE (CONTD)
Would you have me starve

PHILOSTRATE
Right one has got to make a living
May as well have your giggles while
your at it

TOURMALINE
You could take me from this place

PHILOSTRATE
Is this about money The minute
money comes up -
TOURMALINE
The clock strikes midnight and I
turn back into a whore But Im not
talking about money Im talking
about you Youre a shameful coward
We could be together if you werent
So worried about what all your mates
would say if they saw you with a
pixie
Philostrate clenches his jaw and takes a deep breath

PHILOSTRATE
Its midnight

He pulls out a wad of bills and tosses them at her feet

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Take a sodding bow —

He storms out and slams the door
EXT FAERIE QUARTER CARNIVAL ROW -- MOMENTS LATER

“Phi lostrate walks down the Cobblestone sidewalk hands stuffed
in his pockets head down He passes

AN ALLEY
where he hears CHUCKLING

He turns and sees Barabbas behind some crates facing the
wall pissing He sees Philostrate and smirks

BARABBAS
“Was she good forya guv

Phi lostrate just glares

BARABBAS (CONTD)
Wild Tittle thing Like stickin

Barabbas finishes and pulls his trousers up’

BARABBAS (CONTD)
You got something to say to me mate

PHILOSTRATE
Ive read sleeping with faerie sluts

BARABBAS
Youre a priest arent you

PHILOSTRATE
‘Not real ly no

Philostrate walks calmly up ‘to Barabbas and clocks him in
the jaw Barabbas reels back He wipes blood from his dip

BARABBAS
Bloody hell

He makes like hes going to punch Philostrate back but
Philostrate is too quick

In the blink of an eye Philostrate twists Barabbas 8 arm
and shoves him on the ground Philostrate stands on the
mans back with one foot ‘

-PHILOSTRATE
Dont you ever go back there do you
hear me Never

Sod off I go where I want

Philostrate grabs the Barabbass long braids pulls his head
back and slams his face into the cobblestones with a loud

- wet CRUNCH

PHILOSTRATE
Now I want to hear it

Barabbas weakly spits blood and tooth fragments

BARABBAS
I wont you loon Leave me alone

PHILOSTRATE
Get out of here

Barabbas stumbles to his feet He scrambles off down the
alley Philostrates angry eyes soften to slight remorse

EXT FINISTERE CROSSING -- LATER

Philostrate weaves between carriages as he crosses ‘the busy
intersection in the human area of town He enters a tall
chateau-style apartment building

INT PHILOSTRATES FLAT -- MOMENTS LATER

Philostrate doesnt turn on the lights as he enters He
moves through ghostly pools of gaslight from the city outside

In the kitchen he grabs a dusty bottle of wine from a rack
He pops the cork and takes a gulp

He hears a melodious WARBLING He goes to a wrought-iron
birdcage next to the window where a large song-moth works
its elegant black and purple wings and twitters peacefully

-Philostrate fills the creatures water dish with a bit of
wine from the bottle The song-moth eagerly laps it up

In the den Philostrate pulls a wide black disk from a paper
sleeve He gently puts the disk on a spinning turntable and
sets the stylus in the groove

He sits in the dark perched on the edge of his chair as a
lush faerie opera - La Crimioara - crackles from a brass
horn

He listens intensely as a lonely mezzo-soprano trickles
through the weeping violins

He looks down at the wine bottle in his hand He fiddles
with the label and slowly peels it off He crumples the
wine label in his hand and tosses it in the corner

As the music crescendos he stands and goes to the kitchen
He opens the window He-slides the latch and opens the tiny
door of the birdcage The song-moth hops tothe threshold

- Philostrate watches as the song-moth flutters into the night
while the sounds of a-somber aria in a lilting ancient faerie
tongue fill the flat

“INT CENTRAL OPS (HALLWAY) -- MORNING
The usually tidy Philostrate ambles past bustling constables
and officers He wears the same rumpled clothes from the
previous night His deep eyes grim and listless

A shrill POLICE KLAXON sounds A YOUNG’ CONSTABLE runs past

PHILOSTRATE
Constable What is it

YOUNG CONSTABLE
Another murder sir At number 16
Carnival Row Madame Mabs

The Constable continues away leaving Philostrate paralyzed
INT LE CHAMBRE DE MADAME MAR -- LATER

Philostrate floats down the

SECOND STORY HALLWAY

in horrified disbelief He weaves between CONSTABLES taking
statements from sobbing FAERIE MADAMES

His eyes fix on Tourmalines open door where sporadic flashés
of light’ from a camera throw long ominous shadows across the
dark hallway He moves slowly towards the door

He hears voices from inside

PHOEBOTROPIST (0S)
--Species Faerie Wings sawed off
at the meta-scapula Completely
drained of blood via two puncture
wounds in the neck

He stops just outside the doorway and closes his eyes
Finally he opens them and steps into
TOURMALINES ROOM

where he sees Sergeant Bottom and Magistrate Flute talking
in the corner The PHOEBOTROPIST moves skittishly taking
pictures of something on the floor obscured by the bed

FLUTE
Ah Inspector Jacks gettinga
little more courageous Not just
street faeries anymore

Dimly aware he makes his way around the bed He follows a
trail of wet faerie blood smeared across the hardwood floor -

FLUTE (CONTD)
Were taking this one to the morgue
The Haruspex can read her there I
think were making the locals nervous

A breeze from the window vipplés the gauze drapes covering
the body Philostrate stops in his tracks Scraps of paper
sketches and paintings dance at his feet

BOTTOM 7
Dont think that gets you off the
hook with the paperwork mate Im
not doing all this bilge on my own

The drapes fall revealing - Tourmaline Pale skin still
faintly glittering with a hollow shadow of life Philostrate
averts his eyes

The wind tosses awad of bills over his boots Philostrate
shuts bis mouth tight and swallows hard

Flute scrutinizes Philostrate concerned

FLUTE
Inspector What are you thinking

A flash from the Phoebotropists camera

FLUTE (CONTD)
Are you alright

PHTLOSTRATE
Yes Yes Im quite alright

Philostrate slowly backs away from the body

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Let me know what you find

BOTTOM

Whoa Where you going I told you

Philostrate ignores Bottom and goes out into the hall Followed
closely by Flute

The door swings open and Philostrate walks in
INT THE FIDDLIN COCKATRICE -- CONTINUOUS

Hazy gaslight A bar Shelves of dusty bottles Low tables
with oriental pillows instead of chairs On each table a
bulbous assembly of glass globes atop a gas burner

The few patrons watch Philostrate suspiciously an ELF twirls
a cane A DWARF shifts in his seat The BARTENDER whispers
to the big boss man -

- KASMIR a rakshasa ‘(an Eastern vampire) He has the face
of a tiger blue skin narrow yellow eyes He strokes his
fu manchu of braided whiskers as he puffs a pipe

He draws up his silken oriental robe and gracefully strolls
over to Philostrate trying to remain discreet

KASMIR
You make my clientele nervous

PHILOSTRATE
Youre a vampire arent you Kasmir

KASMIR
Im a rakshasa Not exactly the -

PHILOSTRATE
You suck blood

KASMIR
Thats right

PHILOSTRATE
Where were you last night

KASMIR
What are you getting at

PHILOSTRATE
Tourmalines dead Jack got her
She was completely dry of blood So
Im asking - Where were you last
night

KASMIR

‘My friend Im a rare breed of
vampire yes but faerie blood is

Still poisonous to me But you know
that I dont think this is why’
youre here Can I get you anything
A stiff bottle of Mabsynthe perhaps

PHILOSTRATE
Im off that rubbish

KASMIR
Now now Its not all rubbish
Memories of things lost made real
again Unbroken dreams I think I
know why you came here Even if you
dont

Kasmir turns and checks the faded labels on the bell jars
and bottles squinting his yellow cat-eyes in concentration-

KASMIR (CONTD)
Liqueur of Barbary Lamb Will o
Whisps Cocktailah here we are

He selects the proper bottle and sets it in front of
Philostrate who stares at the iridescent green syrup inside

KASMIR (CONTD)
Keep your guilders Compliments of
the management

Philostrate takes the bottle to a table He sits on a pillow
and uncorks it He pours the green treacle into the glass
globe assembly and screws the lid on

KASMIR (CONTD)
Catch this Unseelie Jack wont you
Business just hasnt been the same
in any of my establishments

Philostrate ignores him ‘screws a rubber hose to the globe
and lights the burner A bright flash The Mabsynthe —
ignites Green flames lick the oily surface of the liquid

KASMIR- (CONTD)
This is usually where people come to
‘forget their fears

The globe fills with a thick green vapor Philostrate takes
the pipe at the end of the hose and inhales He holds it
in shuts his eyes and exhales

“ Faerie wings pinned to a giant board A young wingless

faerie stands nude her backto us Blood trickles down her
spine She points to the board where a pair of wings flutter

-- The grub swells and hardens intoa cocoon It glows with

the faint outline of a human skeleton inside

7 Kasmir grins with glistening fangs and wild yellow eyes

His face dissolves to the Haruspexs face old skin cracked
and wrinkled the blackness of her glasses

-- The cocoon opens to a huddled toddler faerie Her crinkled
wings begin to dry as she ages maturing into a shapely form
with curls of blonde hair She becomes Tourmaline

- A vortex of newspapers caught in a breeze swirl and combine
themselves into a mysterious figure in a long coat

-- The huddled Tourmalines wings turn black then her whole
body She breaks up into ash on the wind

Philostrate stumbles He shuts the door behind him clumsily —
dropping the empty bottle It shatters on the sidewalk

EXT FAERIE QUARTER STREET -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Philostrate walks alone His hollow FOOTFALLS sound through
the deserted Faerie Quarter Suddenly he becomes dizzy

He braces himself against a wall and vomits into a gutter

A SCREAM issues from an alley Philostrate listens Another
MUFFLED SCREAM Philostrate runs down the alley towards

THE CLOSE

at the end Philostrate stops In the center a DARK FIGURE
capers over a squirming young faerie VIGNETTE

PHILOSTRATE
Hey

The Dark Figure looks up its face in shadows It hisses
and backs away Philostrateruns to check on the faerie

Younger than Tourmaline Short dark hair matted with sweat

Her wings severed Glittering blood trickles from her neck

Her eyes weak and pained

VIGNETTE
(desperate whisper)
Help meI cant feel my wings

‘Philostrate turns to glimpse a long billowing cloak slithering

from shadow to shadow as if one with its wearer

Philostrate pulls a flintlock revolver from inside his coat
He fires into the darkness The shape slinks quickly into

The wingless faerie shivering on the ground looks to
Philostrate Her brittle voice cracks

voice sings the aria from La Crimioara

Thank you for all -youve done but -

Her pointed ear twitches She hears something The
stealthful COCK OF A GUN She looks through the peephole

down silently with his fingers
Vignette turns to Philostrate

black police carriages

Philostrates front door

Startled Philostrate and Vignette both snap around

A second THUD

On the third IMPACT the door splinters to pieces The

rifles and muskets poised

Sergeant Bottom steps in behind them and surveys the scene
Other than the police the room is empty

on the end of his bayonet A wad of bloody clothes

make ourselves invisible

Everyone leaves Bottom hangs behind staring at the faerie
blood in the tub mesmerized by the swirling colors dancing
on the surface He reaches down and dips his gloved hand
UNDER WATER

breath They look up at Bottoms distorted image as his
hand breaks the surface reaching towards them

His hand comes mere centimeters away from Vignettes stomach
She sucks in A bubble escapes from her mouth while on

clings to his fingers oe

Was she some sort of painter

Philostrate runs his hand along the unmade sheets He frowns
Vignette starts to rifle through the drawings

VIGNETTE (cont D)
Hey some of these arent bad

Philostrate takes the pillow in-his hands He cradles it’
gingerly his jaw clenched

VIGNETTE (CONTD)
I think Ive seen these This one

He hears it a FAINT BUZZ

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Drakes

Suddenly a giant mechanical dragonfly (a Drake) hovers
over the roof wings beating furiously The PILOT in the
abdomencockpit glares at Philostrate ‘The GUNNER on top
swings a turret-mounted Gatling gun around

The pilot speaks into a brass horn His amplified voice
booms over the raucous sounds of the vehicle

PILOT
Rycroft Philostrate You are
instructed to surrender to the
Metropolitan Constabulary

PHILOSTRATE
(to Vignette)
Run
He grabs her hand They make a run for it
The Gatling gun explodes to life shattering slate shingles
at their feet They make it to the edge of the roof and
leap over the alley to the next roof The Drake pursues
The gun punches fist-sized holes in the chimey next to them
They clamor over the rooftops slipping on shingles weaving
between’ chimeys jumping narrow alleys But the drake ‘stays -
on their tail spitting a steady stream of deadly shells

They come to another ledge too wide to jump and slide to a
Stop Pebbles fall to the alley bellow

The Drake comes up behind It doesnt fire Out of bullets

-The Gunner starts to load another magazine

Vignette looks down She steps forward and breaths deep

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
(What are you doing

VIGNETTE
Follow my lead

PHILOSTRATE
You do remember you cant fly

She jumps Halfway down she grabs a clothesline She
shimmies over and drops to an awning She slides down the
awning and lands on a pile of crates

The Gunner- finishes loading the Gatling gun - Just as he
takes aim on Philostrates back he jumps

Philostrate copies all -of Vignettes maneuvers to end up in
THE ALLEY

where he hits the ground running Vignette already at the
end motions Philostrate to follow her around a corner into

A CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS
out of the Drakes view
Philostrate huddles between the wall and Vignette awkwardly
close They -wait-for the Drake to pass by Both of them
painfully self-conscious of this moment of forced proximity
She looks up Their eyes meet She gently brushes the hair
off his forehead then quickly withdraws her hand and lowers
her eyes Slowly she lets her head fall against his chest
After a few moments the Drake finally leaves
Philostrate and vignette climb out of the crevice
PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
I need to talk to someoné who knows

the majestic marble columns Her lip trembles She buries
her face in her hands and shudders

She looks up and wipes her eyes ‘She climbs to her feet and
shakes her head

ROAN
(quiet to herself)
Im not’ going back to the Quarter
Not’ tonight

She flaps her bright blue translucent wings fluttering up
the tall regal colums to

THE ROOF OF THE MUSEUM

where she lands daintily on the ledge She looks over the
city towards the Faerie Quarter an indistinct blur in the
fog across the distant river

ROAN (CONTD)
Im staying here tonight

She clenches her fists and grits her teeth She shouts at
the top of her lungs

You like that This vermins not
goin back to her hole in the wall
Hex voice cracks and decays to a whisper

Im gonna dirty up your pretty

She goes and huddles up next to the skylight She closes
her eyes and tries to go to sleep

A breeze picks up It HISSES at Roan She opens her eyes
On the ledge of the roof stands a cléaked Dark Figure
silhouetted by the silver full moon The long tattered black
‘cloak whips in the breeze

Roan gasps She scrambles back onto the skylight

The Dark Figure makes no move towards her

Roan hears something TINK TINK She looks down A
web of cracks shoots across the skylight at her feet She
stands perfectly still “She looks back to the ledge

The Dark Figure still doesnt budge from ‘its perch

Roan makes a decision She flaps her wings

Too late The disturbance shatters the glass at her feet

’ before her wings can get enough lift

She tumbles down into
‘THE LOBBY OF THE MUSEUM

past the giant fossilized skeleton of the dragon hanging
from the ceiling

She lands with a BONE-CRUNCHING THUD on the polished marble
floor Shards of glass bounce around her Her wings shredded

nearly to ribbons useless

A horrid WET COUGH Blood trickles from her mouth She
tries to sit up but winces

She hears a CREAK and GROANING of stéel- She looks up

The steel cables holding the dragon above her SNAP

The whole skeleton crashes to the ground

As the dust clears Roan sees shes trapped under the
Cavernous rib cage Shafts of moonlight stream down on her
the only light in the lobby

The FLAPPING of a cloak as a shadow quickly passes over her
She looks up Nothing but the broken skylight and the silver
disc of the moon beyond’ She hears a RASPY HISS echo in the
lobby around her

She gets a vague impression of the Dark Figure circling her
slowly deliberately through the shadows Slithering between

the ancient stone monoliths and fossils Coming closer

ROAN - (CONT D)
Please Please dont do this

The Dark Figures voice seems to come from everywhere as the
sound bounces from wall to wall of the large dark room

DARK FIGURE
Tore your pretty wings did you

Roan peeks between the dragons ribs into the darkness She

sees the outline of someone standing the shadows

DARK FIGURE (CONTD)
Tisk Such pretty wings A shame

Rodns eyes adjust to the darkness as she stares intently a

the motionless humanoid outline in front of her

It resolves itself into nothing more than a stone sarcophagus
on a pedestal an exhibit

Suddenly a clawed hand grabs her torn wings from behind and
pulls her back against the rib cage RIP Her wings are
gone She opens her mouth too stunned to make a sound

The hand grabs her hair and yanks her head back exposing
her neck

thin splatter of blood arcing from the tears in her back
across the marble floor

He notices Bottom and Flute approaching

He turns as they approach and tips his hat over his eyes
He takes a few steps back and casually leans against the
opposite side of a sarcophagus close enough to eavesdrop

as eye witness testimony If she — -

calls after Philostrate

lived in Hy-Brasil the flower city

She looks over the costume rack and gazes into the distance
VIGNETTE (CONTD) ‘
Flowers everywhere Growing up the
walls of buildings right into folks
houses So much colour

PHILOSTRATE
Whyd you leave

She takes a deep contemplative breath and turns with an air
of finality back to the piles of costumes

VIGNETTE
Its a big world out there There
was still quite a bit Id never seen

She selects an emerald green frock and sets it over an
Oriental screen She goes behind the screen to change

Philostrate looks away past the wallpaper of theatre posters

PHILOSTRATE
Thats a nice enough answer but you
and I know the real reason The
only reason any came over The
Scourge of the homeland The faerie
plague

VIGNETTE
Please I appreciate your sympathy
Dont talk about things you dont
understand
PHILOSTRATE
I understand a little I lived there
Hy-Brasil The city of flowers

VIGNETTE
What

PHILOSTRATE
My ‘mother and father were officers
-with the Burguish Imperial Navy
stationed in Tirnanog I lived in
the Human Concession

VIGNETTE
You are not serious

She absent-mindedly finishes unbuttoning her shirt and lets
at slide to the floor as she listens

PHILOSTRATE
Iam I was only a boy when the
‘Scourge broke out The International
Human forces were the first to
withdraw My parents didnt make
it An old faerie opera singer found
me and took it upon herself to see
that I made it out of the country
We were caught in a flocd of refugees
looking for a way out

VIGNETTE
An opera singer Is that why you -

PHILOSTRATE
Yes -

Vignette steps into her clean costume trousers her brow
furrowed as she listens She can hardly believe her ears

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
I must have been a terrible drain on
her resources At any time she
could have done hetter to abandon
me Just as my people had abandoned
hers dust as I abandoned

Philostrate stops himself A long pause Vignette looks
over the screen to make sure Philostrate is okay

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
But she didnt Finally there was
a boat - a cramped Selkie Trawler
‘slick with fish guts It carried
about a hundred of us across the
North seas to a smugglers’ port just
outside of the Burgue where we were
met by the coast police The Burgque
had enough of the faerie refugees
Theyd let no one off Except me
The human

Vignette watches Philostrate from over the screen she bends
to grab a clean shirt from the floor but suddenly GASPS
She grabs her back agonized —

She shoots up quick knocking the screen over The scréen
SLAMS against the floor planks with a flourish of dust

Philostrate turns and finally sees her standing there- in-
nothing but the emerald- -green pants and the old bandage across
her chest and back She winces doubled over in pain

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
What are you doing
Th

VIGNETTE
I was just changing and - Oh bloody
hell my back

Philostrate rushes over He turns her around to get a good
look at her back Dark bloodstains show through the bandage

PHILOSTRATE
We have to change your bandages

A LITTLE LATER

Vignette sits on a short stool in front of Philostrate
Philostrate cuts the bandage and slowly unwraps it He drops
the soiled bandage to the floor

He reaches up and gingerly traces the tear-shaped gashes on
her back They sparkle with crystallized faerie blood eerily
beautiful Her back muscles twitch slightly

VIGNETTE
Sometimes it feels like theyre still
there Like if I just concentrate
hard enough But its not real
I just want to feel something

She looks up into his eyes Slowly she reaches up and
unbuttons the bottom of Philostrates shirt She-slides her
hand across his stomach Philostrate closes his eyes

Vignette gently kisses his abs She moves up With swelling
excitement she feverishly unbuttons the rest of his shirt
with her teeth She kisses and nips at his chest

Face to face she stops She sees something like fear in
Philostrates eyes She starts to pull back

Philostrate grabs her-and holds her close pressing her bare’
chest to his own The skin to skin contact galvanizes them
Their lips and tongues meet in a tangled deep kiss

Vignette hops up and wraps her legs around him

Philostrate spins her around and pins her against the wall
Their bodies heaving their hands roaming wildly

Philostrate kisses her neck Vignette throws her head back
gasping Philostrate notices an old poster on the wall just
over her shoulder He recognizes the signature Tourmaline
He pushes himself away staggering back

VIGNETTE (CONTD)
What What is it ‘

PHILOSTRATE
I cant Im sorry
yee

For the first time Vignette seems awkwardly self-conscious

VIGNETTE
Oh Of course Its alright

She sheepishly covers her breasts and turns away She notices
the poster on the wail

VIGNETTE (CONTD)
(whispering)
How callous of me

Philostrate sees a trickle of fresh blood sliding down her
naked back He grabs a white cloak from a costume rack

PHILOSTRATE
Here Put your arms up

She does Philostrate wraps thé new bandage around her

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
I think we opened that gash a little

VIGNETTE
I suppose Im going to have to be
More careful from now on
PHILOSTRATE
Itll heal Itll take some time
and there will be a fair amount of
scarring But itll heal

He finishes wrapping the bandage Vignette gives him a soft
sympathetic smile

INT PARLIAMENT ANTECHAMBER -- AFTERNOON

Armed GUARDS pull a set of tall doors open In the doorway
silhouetted against the gray daylight stands a figure draped
in flowing fabric - GUINEVERE CARTIER

Dame Whitley steps forward to greet her

DAME
Miss Cartier Such an honour we

GUINEVERE
The honour is mine

INT PARLIAMENT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Guineveres silken gown at once modest and seductive clings

and billows like liquid as she walks A translucent veil

marked by silver moons and stars covers her face

Her wings the same shade of brilliant purple and pink as
the silk fabric flex gracefully
Dame Whitley keeps stride next to her

DAME
I apologize that youmust suffer my
husbands paranoid security before I
may escort you to the ballroom

GUINEVERE
Not at all

DAME
fhe entire Faeriess Rights Lobby is
here as well as many of the undecided
moderates in Parliament I cant

Behind them an ASSISTANT wheels a player-harpsichord
polished and lacquered to a mirror shine

PHILOSTRATE (V0)
Where are we We are nowhere

INT ORPHEUM PLAYHOUSE (PROP ATTIC) -- SAME
Philostrate thinks out loud

PHILOSTRATE
The only individual Ive met who has
use for faerie blood is Kasmir
Tell me about the Purple Triad

Vignette responds from behind the screen as she finishes
changing -

VIGNETTE
Kasmirs narcotics ring Theyve
got their fingers in everything
Its really the whole underworld
But Kasmir isnt who youre looking
for He pays for blood Its all
voluntary

PHILOSTRATE
Yeah but why pay for what ‘You can
take for free

VIGNETTE ee

Quill would know - He keeps up with
all the underworld goings-on

PHILOSTRATE
Quill would know wouldnt he -

VIGNETTE
Come on now You dont honestly

Unseelie Jack

PHILOSTRATE
I cant rule anything out

VIGNETTE
Then what about the State

PHILOSTRATE
Are you saying Jack could be - what
The Mayors insane cousin

VIGNETTE
Or at least on the Mayors payroll
Its well known what he thinks of
the Quarter

PHILOSTRATE
The Mayor is a Rocs arse and a bigot
but a genocidal despot

(sighs)

Yeah we are nowhere I cant go on
fighting this war on two fronts
Running after Unseelie Jack and
running from the police Theres a
-big picture here that I just cant
see from where I stand

VIGNETTE
Hey Take a look at this

She steps from behind the screen wearing a garish green frock
coat and vest a ruffled silk cravat and a scarlet bandanna

PHILOSTRATE
Why is it always the strange ones I
get stuck with

VIGNETTE
Idont know Love is blind
PHILOSTRATE

Oh You know what I didnt mean

PHILOSTRATE

‘No hold on You just gave me an
‘idea

INT PARLIAMENT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - MOMENTS LATER

Guinevere stands at a kiosk before a crew of Guardsmen - A
COMMODORE with a clipboard and a LEFTENANT inspecting an
unrolled spool of music for the automatic harpsichord

Dame Whitley stands to the side arms crossed impatiently

COMMODORE
Lift your veil please

Guinevere complies Her dark almond eyes betraying no ill
will The Commodore reaches to touch the starburst of jewels
fixed to her paie forehead She flinches back for a moment

DAME
Come on now Leave her alone
Its jewelry not poison

GUINEVERE
It is my religion I may not remove
it I apologize

DAME
See there you are

“The Commodore makes a note in his clipboard The Leftenant
opens the lid of the harpsichord to go over the insides

7 COMMODORE
Alright Miss Cartier If you would
kindly just disrobe

DAME
What

COMMODORE
Standard security protocol

DAME
You are not strip-searching her

Unnoticed the Leftenant covertly attaches a device -a pair
of glass canisters - to the inside of the harpsichord -

GUARD’
All due respect Dame but she could
be hiding anything under that gown

DAME
She is a guest Now you end this
ridiculous posturing or I will have
you mopping griffin shit in -the’
stables for the rest of your days

The Commodore turns to Leftenant The Leftenant nods The
Commodore turns back to Guinevere ae

GUARD
Id say that does it Have a lovely
performanice

The Leftenant closes the harpsichord with the device inside’
EXT MEDSOMER MARKET -- MOMENTS LATER

A street lined with canvas tents Display cases with beaded
jewelry bushels of bright tropical fruits exotic sea
creatures on beds of ice roasted beasts hang from meat hooks

The thick crowd of shoppers (FAERIES PUCKS DWARVES SELKIES
and many OTHERS) pulsates and flows down the street haggling
prices dropping coins into scales etc

Vignette weaves through the crowd Philostrate follows
wearing a gentlemens cloak his face hidden in the shadow
of a broad slouch hat

PHILOSTRATE
You sure Quill can help us with the
plan

VIGNETTE

Oh yes He lives for these sorts of
suicidal ideas

She leads Philostrate around a corner into
AN ADJACENT ALLEY

Philostrate notices the way “Vignette s bandanna covers the
-tips of her pointed ears

PHILOSTRATE
You know something
VIGNETTE
What
PHILOSTRATE
You could almost pass for a human
VIGNETTE
Im sorry What
7 PHILOSTRATE
With your ears covered like that and
no no wings If you wanted you

VIGNETTE
(gravely offended)
What the bilge makes you think I

would want that

PHILOSTRATE
Now wait That didnt come out right -

VIGNETTE
Let me tell you something you
arrogant part ‘Those wings were
part of me Howd you feel if someone
lopped off your legs

She storms away enraged

PHILOSTRATE
Stop Wait Vignette

He qrabs her’ shoulder and spins her around

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Look faeries get an awful sour
shuffle in this city Theres no
reason why you cant live with the
privileges afforded to humans

VIGNETTE
This is my bloody life youre talking
about This is my world Im not a
rutting human And if you have a
problem with all
(gesturing around her)

all this This whole “sour
shuffle Then you have a problem
with me Because its part of me
And I wont pretend otherwise

Vignette glares at Philostrate ‘Hurt Her eyes shimmering
with angry tears

VIGNETTE (CONTD)
Come on Lets get out of here

INT PARLIAMENT BALLROOM -- SAME

STATE OFFICIALS in tuxedos and formal -gowns finish ‘taking
their seats as the lights dim

The Mayor and Dame Whitley sit in the front row

onstage the ‘Assistant winds the harpsichord with a starter
Guinevere steps into the amber glow of the footlights

A sleek gleaming brass microphone descends on wire and stops
in front of Guineveres mouth She lifts her veil im

The Dame ‘leans to ‘the Mayor

DAME
You behave yourself

The Mayor smirks

The harpsichord begins to play itself The spool of music
feeds into the instrument The twittering metallic MUSIC -
a familiar tune - the aria from La Crimioara

Guinevere sings the prelude in a smokey soulful voice

We follow the path of the scroll of sheet music as it unwinds
itself into the harpsichord’s inner workings Sprockets and
pins ride the punch holes in the paper

The motion translates to tiny hammers that bounce on the
metal strings that produce the sound A copper trigger wire
clamped to a single string runs to the planted device

Guinevere delicately holds the gleaming microphone She
sings softly with her lips pressed to the mic

A HARSH CHORD Inside the instrument the strings vibrate
but the trigger remains undisturbed The tempo quickens

In the audience the Mayor looks at his watch He stands up
and moves towards the exit The Dame shoots him a cross
look but remains in her seat

Guinevere spreads her glorious wings in - an explosion of
colour She dances flitting about the stage like something
between a ballet dancer and a fluttering moth

The black and white keys undulate Inside the hammers pound
the strings in a wave of motion The last hammer lands
squarely on the trigger

The planted device bursts to life Glass cylinders SQUEAL
their liquid contents boiling as they mix Rubber hoses
spew a vile green gas into the harpsichord

Noxious clouds spill from the sides of the harpsichord

Guinevere stops dancing

The audience murmurs nervously The Dame stands -

As the gas overtakes Guinevere she drops to her knees She
gags and fitfully grabs the air with fingers twisted by pain
Her once colourful wings blacken and wilt

‘The Dame turns and tries to outrun the spreading gas The

cloud engulfs the bewildered audience behind her

The Dame reaches the back of the Ballroom where Guards in
gas masks block the exits

She turns to see dim human shapes convulsing in the unnatural
haze dropping one by one The cloud swallows her while in

THE LOBBY

just outside the Mayor watches through sealed glass He
lights a cigar and blows a casual plume of smoke against the
window as his wife grabs her chest coughing and falls

The only sound in the room issues from the player- harpsichord
still playing that light jazzy tune

against the tight alley walls

The police carriage follows scraping the bricks

and flickering gas lamps and garnished with rusted suits of
armour and chinked shields - ornaments of a faded era

A horrid CACKLING echoes through the long dark halls

listens as he passes every door

He hears SCREAMING He turns and kicks the door in quickly
taking aim

She stretches out one of hex arms and lets her claws drag
along the wall gouging the plaster shattering the gas lamps

Philostrate grabs his pistol

Bottom manages to hit the deck at the last minute The
Haruspex soars over his head

Philostrate whirls to’ fire but shes too quick She breaks

Philostrate notices a funny smell ‘He surveys the hallway-
He hears a steady HISS from the gouged walls

He moves closer and sees
A RUPTURED PIPE
spewing rippling gas into the hall He glances at

MAYOR
What

FLUTE
He died in the explosion of the
Marzipan Inn

MAYOR
Well Thats that Case closed
This calls for a little celebration

He strolls to a cabinet and withdraws a bottle and glasses

FLUTE
Sir I dont believe Unseelie Jack
is dead

The Mayor stops He forces a chuckle as he pours two drinks

MAYOR
Now Magistrate

Flute drops some papers on the Mayors desk The Mayor turns

MAYOR (CONTD)
Whats all this then

FLUTE
A budget for the Mayors Defense
Consulate With provisions for an
eggs for vouchers program Donate
“piological material to the census
and walk away with bread vouchers
Emphasis on faeries and vampires

The Mayor still smiling but with controlled fury in his
eyes Flute becomes even more bold

FLUTE (CONTD)
Harvesting samples from faeries and
vampires Do you know what Unseelie
Jack is

MAYOR
A test tube genocide -

FLUTE

Maybe that was the idea But what
if it became impractical You cant
set an army of monsters on the city
But you can use one to steer your
agenda Scare the faeries Make
them angry enough They become a
plausible threat and then

MAYOR
- Youve had your nose in one too many
penny dreadfuls

Its been a good week for you sir
‘hasnt it Carnival Row is empty

The visions you have when youre on’
Mabsynthe Theyre caused by the
faerie blood

QUILL
I imagine thats how the Haruspex
gets her powers

KASMIR

One holds

Whenever I brew a new batch I usually
include samples from several different

donors Thats why the visions are
all jumbled

Kasmir snaps his fingers ‘The Komodo withdraws a full

syringe

KASMIR (CONTD)
Here she is Vignette

He flips the syringe and squeezes the air bubbles out

KASMIR (CONTD)
But if one was to take a solution
fromthe blood of a single donor
One would enter the present mind of
that donor See what she sees
’ Feel what she feels It is a
unique experience

QUILL
But Philo you have to understand
If shes dead

Youll die a very ugly painful death

He arches his back and SCREAMS His eyes completely white

(The images come in erratic bursts Speeding up and slowing
down alternately In Vignettes POV)

- Into a grimy subterranean vault

- Cluttered with tall glass chambers Ghastly beasts tangles
of tentacles and claws suspended in murky preservatives

- Chains hanging from the ceiling
- A wall plastered with severed faerie wings
- Part of a sign on the wall “Dalrymple Street

Iron shackles snap around Vignettes wrists A meat hook
eatches the chain

- Vignettes feet dangle above the blood-smeared tile floor
- The Haruspexs face

The Haruspexs wicked claws shred Vignettes clothes off

- The Haruspex turns the’ nozzle of a hose and sprays down
Vignettes hanging naked body with a hard stream of water

Philostrate twists and contorts He turns away from the
imaginary stream of water He shuts his eyes tight

frayed leathery membrane

Philostrate winces and sits up quickly He holds his stomach

nauseated He wipes the sweat from his brow and thinks

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
He told me he was into twining

QUILL
Wait What Twining

- PHILOSTRATE
Using magic and bio- technology to
create hybrids
Philostrate pushes himself off the examination table
QUILL
Youre saying the Haruspex is some
kind of artificial creation

Quill Would the Dalrymple Street
tube station still be under the annex

INT DALRYMPLE STREET STATION -- SAME

Flooded train tracks cut through Glass chambers’ with
floating monstrosities preserved within A web of chains
hangs from the dark ceiling

Vignette dangles in midair suspended from a meat hook in
front of the wall of trophy faerie wings

Alcandre hums a tune as he pushes a surgical instrument cart
in front of Vignette

ALCANDRE
Youre lucky to be alive Thats
why youre here

VIGNETTE
Who are you

ALCANDRE
to am the Twiner The Almighty
Alchemist of Chaos -

Alcandre pulls a sleek black glove out of a metal canister °
He slides the glove on It snaps itself skin-tight to the
contours of his hand 7

VIGNETTE
What are you going to do with that

Alcandre speaks with the bedside manner of a friendly doctor
ALCANDRE
This lets me reach inside you

He holds her steady with his bare hand while he Slowly reaches
for her stomach with the black glove The air CRACKLES with
a mysterious ELECTRIC HUM

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
This is going to hurt quite a bit

He touches her stomach Her skin yields to his fingertips
and ripples as if it were only water He reaches inside

Vignette chokes on a scream Her face contorts with
unbearable pain

Alcandre reaches deeper

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
A faerie lays an egg A grub hatches
éats and becomes a cocoon Under
normal circumstances what emerges
from the cocoon ressembies a healthy
human toddler with wings But while
in the cocoon a faeries biology
becomes soft and pliable like clay

Vignette spasms and convulses
ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Ripe for the tender touch of a
sculptor

Alcandre slides his hand out slowly Her skin closes itself
behind the glove No blood or cuts Vignette shudders

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
But before cocoons

Alcandre looks down at the handful of tiny pearl-white faerie
eggsin-the palm of his hand

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
-there are eggs

He gently spoons the eggs into a beaker
VIGNETTE
(trembling) —
You You sick rutter

ALCANDRE
Such a strong-willed girl

‘Alcandre reaches inside her stomach
Vignette explodes into body-wrenching seizures

‘Alcandre bites his lip with concentration as he probes

Vignettes innards

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Just relax those muscles dear
Theyre jelly in my hands Youre
only making it difficult for yourself

He reaches deeper
Vignette writhes and gags

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
You are quite the remarkable specimen
To survive an attack from the
Haruspex

He withdraws his hand clutching another small handful of
eggs He spoons theminto a container

Vignette hangs in midair shivering

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Most faeries who lose their wings
commit suicide within the first day

He reaches back inside
Vignettes eyes roll back as she shakes —

- ALCANDRE (CONTD)

Yet here you are Even now still’
clinging to consciousness when others
would have surely passed out

He pulls another handful of eggs out and examines then with
his fingertip Vignette falls limp still shaking

Vignette looks up her eyes’ filled with hate A trickle of
bile at the corner of her mouth She wheezes heavily

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Those eyes So determined

Alcandre gestures to the monsters preserved in the glass
chambers all around

ALCANDRE (CONTD)

“So many of my experiments never live
more than a few days But youre a
survivor Your children will be
survivors too The Haruspex was
just a prototype My employer only
needed one’ He doesnt know what
Im really making The Haruspex was’
the first of a perfect race that
will eat and replace your kind A-
race that will call me God Smile
you get to play mother to the newest
most dominant species on the planet

Suddenly a GUNSHOT
Alcandres eyes widen

He pulls his hand out of Vignettes abdomen and touches his
chest

A spreading bloodstain darkens his shirt
ALCANDRE (CONTD)

(looking down curiously)
How strange

His eyes roll back He collapses

Behind him Philostrate climbs up from the flooded train
tracks followed by Quill He holsters his smoking revolver

They hurriedly untie Vignette

QUILL
Bloody hell What was he doing

Vignette falls into Philostrates arms limp Eyes closed

PHILOSTRATE
Vignette Are you okay

No response He shakes her

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Vignette

She weakly opens her eyes Philostrate sighs with relief
She hugs him with all her strength

-PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Its okay 0

She lets go Quill wraps a cloak around her She lowers
her eyes to Alcandres body disgusted 0

VIGNETTE
Give me your gun
PHILOSTRATE
Hes dead —
- VIGNETTE
I know I said give me your sodding
gun
PHILOSTRATE

Listen The Haruspex is still around
Did you see where she went

Without tearing her hateful gaze from Alcandres body she
shakes her head

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
(to Quill)
Keep an eye on her
Quill nods

Philostrate pulls out his revolver and stealthily stalks
through the abandoned station

Only the soft sounds of FLOWING WATER and the CRUNCHING of
broken glass under Philostrates boots

He looks slowly back and forth

He hears the GENTLE CLINKING of chains swaying overhead
Philostrate looks up

The Haruspex hangs bat-like from the ceiling She twists

her head to look down Her eye-snakes poise to strike She
lets herself plummet talons outstretched cackling

‘She lands on Philostrate pinning him down Her enormous
wings beat the air as she slashes at him in a flurry of claws
Philostrate dodges as best he can

Quill smacks the back of her skull with a steel tray

In a single quick motion she grabs Quill throws him over
her shoulder

Philostrate rolls away aims and fires The Haruspex
SCREECHES and slinks around a corner Silence

QUILL
Did you hit her

PHILOSTRATE
I think so

Vignette limps to Philostrate She touches the nicks and -
cuts that crisscross his face

PHILOSTRATE (CONTD)
Im okay ‘

He motions for her to move behind him He walks towards the
shadows his revolver raised- He turns a corner

He trains his gun on a dark heap on the ground as ‘he
approaches ‘He kneels cautiously

The Haruspexs wrinkled face stares biankly at him from amidst
the heavy dark folds of her cloak Hereye sockets empty

VIGNETTE
Is she dead

PHILOSTRATE
Somethings wrong

He slowly reaches out and touches her face He prods the
dark cloak Nothing solid He grabs her gray hair and picks
‘the face up Skin only - a hollow husk

QUILL
Maybe she melted

Philostrate looks around Something ‘suddenly ececurs to him

PHILOSTRATE
Wheres Vignette

INT FLOODED TUBE TUNNEL -- SAME

Alcandre stumbles through the knee-deep water The SPLASHING
of his labored running echoes through the long dark tunnel

He stops to catch his breath He grabs his bleeding chest
and laughs a little to himself

He hears the slow SPLASHING of someone approaching He turns
and stares into the darkness frightened

Vignette limps into view She stops and glares at Alcandre

ALCANDRE
(chuckling)
I thought you were your Inspector
friend A crack shot - he hit me
right in the heart Well one of
them It never hurts to have a spare

Vignette slowly moves closer Alcandre backs away

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Little one It was just a job

Vignette comes closer still Alcandre scrambles back

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Your kind You choke the streets
and the very skies above our heads
You spread disease and immorality -

VIGNETTE
You violated nature and ine

ALCANDRE °-
I improved on nature I wanted to
make faeries better stronger My
ereations are works of art

He backs against a brick wall cornered

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Im just a scientist

Alcandres hand trembles as he reaches for the steel handle
of a curved ‘surgical blade clipped to his belt

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
Just wanted to study you Just wanted
to see what youre made of inside

He quickly whips out the curved scalpel and makes a wide
swipe at Vignette She gets back just in time with a fresh
shallow cut on her cheek

Vignette pulls back her cloak and lifts her hand She wears
the black surgical glove Alcandres eyes widen

He lunges for her flailing the scalpel Alcandre has ©
Vignette against the wall She holds his wrist as he tries
to bring the scalpel down

ALCANDRE (CONTD)
You dont know how to use that glove

’ VIGNETTE
Ill muddle through

She plunges her gloved hand through Alcandres chest
Alcandres muscles lock up as he squeals in agony

Vignette slowly pulls her hand out She holds Alcandres
heart in her fist

Alcandre musters a weak smile ‘as he slowly slides down the
brick wall and falls face first into the water

Vignette drops his heart She rips off the black glove and
tosses it to the side i

A hand touches her shoulder Vignette jumps startled She
looks up and sees Quill —

QUILL
Lets get out of here

INT DALRYMPLE STREET STATION (LOFTSPACE) - MOMENTS LATER
Philostrate quickly looks through the makeshift lab - various

vials and beakers books papers etc Vignette and (gail)
stand aside Waiting for him -

VIGNETTE
What are you looking for

PHILOSTRATE
I dont know

VIGNETTE

What about the Haruspex —

QUILL
Gone Shed her skin I get the
feeling whereever she is she sa
lot less pretty than usual

VIGNETTE
But where is she

Philostrate finds an envelope Inside he finds a set of
tintypes He looks over the images

-- Failed experiments Twisted faeries sprouting extra limbs
- Rows and rows of monstrous embryos growing in vitro

-- And the last photo ‘The Mayor poses next to Professor
Alcandre amidst all the entrapments of the secret lab

PHILOSTRATE
This is it

He tucks the envelope into his coat pocket

QUILL
if they really were breeding an army
of these things why would the Mayor
bother clearing the Faerie Quarter
The faeries are gone Theres no
need for a horde prowling the night

VIGNETTE

Not a horde The professor was a
Madman who got carried away with his
“own agénda He wanted to make a
whole new race But the Mayor only
wanted one Haruspex from him

PHILOSTRATE
There it is All the faeries are
locked up When youve got the whole
herd corralled you dont need an
army to slaughter them You just
need one

‘QUILL
Oh godspit Philo youre right
The Haruspex Shes gone to feed
To finish the job -

ins and outs of prison

EXT BLEAKNESS KEEP PRISON -- NIGHT

A broken medieval citadel converted to a prison clings to
crags of rock high above the rumbling sea A light drizzle

Glum members of the PRESS stand outside the iron gate and
file routine reports on the faerie incarceration

INT THE CLINK -- SAME

A dank sunken rotunda clotted with FAERIES and other non-
humans A long gutter-toilet splits the room Harsh light
from hissing arc lamps lazily crisscrosses the crowd

ARMED GUARDS patrol on metal catwalks above

In the crowd a FAERIE MOTHER holds her YOUNG GIRL close
The Young Girl whispers to her mom

YOUNG GIRL
I have to go plink

The Mother points to the gutter

FAERIE MOTHER
Thats the potty over there hon

YOUNG GIRL
I know I cant go in front of
everybody

‘FAERIE MOTHER -
Its alright Tl hold your hand

The Mother leads her Young Girl to the gutter The Young
Girl stands on the metal lattice She nervously bunches the
hem of her skirt and starts to squat down

She stops when she hears movement from the darkness below
She squints past the metal grate

YOUNG GIRL
I think theres someone down there
mum oe

The arc lamps above flicker and go out The catwalks suddenly
empty Scattered sounds of doors shutting and locking The
restless murmur of the crowd dims to a whisper
“110

The silence is broken by the lilting humming of an old woman
The tune echoes from the dark under the Young Girls feet

The Young Girl strains to see ‘Past the shadows

Suddenly the Haruspexs eye-vipers strike from between the
lattice

The Young Girl screams ‘and falls back

Talons reach-up shredding the lattice A ghastly form
explodes from the twisted metal hole and takes flight-

Looming above is the Haruspexs true form Gleaming black
scales spindly talons dark wings She grins with rows of
shaxk-like teeth Her eye-vipers giddily snap at the air

HARUSPEX
I will eat for days

She advances on the screaming crowd of Faeries backing them
helplessly against the wall

She nears the Faerie Mother and her Young Girl

The Mother holds her daughter close shuts her eyes tight
and readies for the worst

From out- oF nowhere Philostrate jumps onto the Haruspexs
back and puts a strangle-hold- on her neck

Quill and Vignette emerge from the hole in the gutter

VIGNETTE
Philo dont do anything stupid
oo PHILOSTRATE
No problem Get these people out of

here

The Haruspex tries to shake Philostrate off She zigzags
and slams him into the walls of the rotunda

Her uneven flight forces him to use both arms to hold « on
He cant reach his revolver

She flies at the ceiling beating him against - -the wire mesh
EXT BLEAKNESS KEEP PRISON - CONTINUOUS

around the building locked in a mortal aerial struggle

The Haruspex quickly soars straight up
The fight spirals higher The ground grows distant

As they climb Philostrate watches the prison shrink in a
mist of rain and swirls of low clouds

He makes a grab for his gun as he holds on with one hand
‘He buries the barrel under the Haruspexs chin

The Haruspex cackles as the clouds overtake them Philostrate
shuts his eyes against the pelting rain and wild winds

His clenched knuckles turn blue from the piercing cold
He chokes and gags on the lack of oxygen

to the air

‘They catch Philostrate
Cradling his limp body they descend back to the roof

She turns to the window Philostrate takes her hand in his
own She shoots him a bewildered look

PHILOSTRATE
Im afraid of heights too

VIGNETTE
Where are we going

PHILOSTRATE

Its a big world out there Theres
still quite a bit weve never seen

OUT THE WINDOW

to the sweeping aerial view - tangled streets in a pale haze
of fog dark spires crooked roofs dusky smokestacks

EXT ZEPPELIN -- CONTINUOUS

Vignette stares’ out the portal of the vast airship as it
rises above the swirling clouds held aloft by a canvas
balloon shining against the crisp blue sky

FADE OUT
