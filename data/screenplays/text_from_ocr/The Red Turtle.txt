Part I The man alone

10 The storm

On the ocean far out at sea a storm rages

A man is there on his own in the middle of the waves

A gigantic wave carries him away He sinks then reappears near a barrel
which he clings on to

Later he spots an overturned lifeboat which he struggles over to Night falls
The man is suddenly woken by a wave which is bigger than the others and
which shatters his boat

The man is washed up on a beach Hes saved

11 Exploration of the island and its beauty His survival is ensured
Its the first day on the island

The man has fallen asleep on the beach
His foot is lying on the sand motionless
A crab nips it

The man wakes up with a start jumps to his feet and looks around

The beach seems to stretch to either end of the island

Day has broken and the sun is bright

The man sees something a bit further away He starts running along the
shore But what he took to be a human body is only a rock half-buried under
the sand

He has reached the far end of the beach

He continues his exploration by the rocks when a noise makes him jump Its
a seal sitting on a rock below The animal dives The man starts walking
again

He enters some thick bushes and walks among the close branches of a forest
of bamboo trees A bird flies away as he goes past The man sees some
water caught in some leaves on the ground and kneels down to drink it

Then again he is alerted by a noise a presence He picks up a branch to
use as a weapon But its just the rain A sudden downpour

The Red Turtle

The man carries on walking among the bamboo trees He climbs a hill which
takes him to the highest point of the island Its a hillock an overhanging
rock from where he can see both sides of the island
The island isnt very big Its welcoming with its luxuriant vegetation but it
seems deserted No sign anywhere of any human presence The man calls
out from the top of the hillock but theres no reply

The man has started walking the other way among the bamboo trees
Theres a gap a bit further on A clearing The man goes over to it Its a
waterhole a little pond hemmed in by vegetation Fresh water

The man dives in and drinks the water up to his ears
Just then he sees something a tree fruit a breadfruit tree He climbs up the
tree knocks some fruit down and eats his fill

Through the tall foliage three birds fly past in the clouds

I2 The island and its dangers The desire to leave

Another day

The man climbs over some rocks to explore the other side of the island
He jumps in midair between two rocks

He has reached the far end of the island and looks around him
There is a barrel in the sea below the remains of a shipwreck

He turns back to go down to ferra firma but his foot slips He slides along
the rock trying in vain to stop himself and falls from a dizzy height He lands
in a waterhole between two steep rocks Impossible to climb back up The
rock is too smooth and the incline is too sheer

The man tries his luck by the sea

He plunges under the water and soon discovers that there is no way through
there either an almost horizontal rock seems to block his way between the
two rocks

He goes back to the surface and looks around for another way-out but to no
avail

He goes back under the water and risks his all He dives into the tight
passageway between the rocks The gulley is narrow and it looks like the

man might get stuck unable to get past the obstacle or to get back Hell
soon run out of oxygen

But the mans hand appears on the other side then his whole body
The man races to the surface and hoists himself up onto a flat rock Safe and
sound

Birds fly past in the sky

The man swims behind the barrel

He picks it up and brings it back to the beach but the barrel smashes into a
thousand pieces The man is vexed

As he looks at the horizon another idea comes into his head

He heads into the forest starts to pick up bamboo sticks and brings them
back to the beach

Night falls

The man lies down on the sand Its been a long day

A tiny turtle appears on the sand

The man picks it up looks at it closely then puts it down again

The baby turtle scurries toward the sea Just then another and another then
soon myriad baby turtles hatch in the sand They all rush toward the sea
which sparkles in the moonlight

It is an epic race The sea is nearby but they still have to reach it and the
babies are tiny The man watches their race until the last baby turtle
disappears into the waves

He remains alone facing the endless ocean
How he too would love to leave

The man who had fallen asleep on the beach wakes up in the middle of the
night as if gripped by a strange feeling Theres something on the water He
hurries over to it Its a bridge A huge bridge made of bamboo on piles which
seems to stretch right across the ocean

The man runs onto the bridge dancing for joy He races away

When he wakes up on the beach the sea is dead calm a vast glassy
expanse of water

It was just a dream The man peers at the horizon then lies down again sad
and alone

Fade to black

13 First attempts to leave on a raft Foiled by an unknown
force
Day breaks over the island

On the sand a crab catches sight of a baby turtle which died just before it
reached the waters edge The crab brings it back to its hole

The man is further away finishing building his raft
All thats left now is to launch it

But the raft is too far from the shore The man pushes and pulls to no avail
In the end he lays out a series of bamboos perpendicular to the raft to roll it
over them

Crabs scuttle among the bamboos

The man is sitting high up on the beach

He eats some fruit from the breadfruit tree

A colony of crabs goes over to him eager for food

The man holds out a piece of fruit to the first crab which comes begging

The crab grabs it and scurries off the other crabs in tow
The man watches them disappear over the top of the hill then go past him
coming the other way

Later
As the crabs look on the man gets ready to leave
He pushes the raft to the coral reef then hauls himself onboard

He is still very near the island when he is alerted by a noise

The man looks up Just then something hits the flimsy boat It seems to
come from under the water

The man looks over the side But already a second blow much harder than
the first shatters the raft The man falls into the water He dives looks
around but cant see anything

Screenplay 4
The Red Turtle

He comes back up to the surface and goes back to the island

Four crabs have come out of their holes and are looking at the sea no doubt
at the returning man

Suddenly they scuttle back to their holes But there are only three holes for
four crabs

The first three to arrive take possession of the three holes

The fourth runs flat out from one occupied hole to another

In the end it dives into the sand just before the mans foot lands on it

The man exits the frame the four crabs reappear

The man goes back to the top of the beach

He yells out furious at the unknown force which stopped him leaving

Then he disappears again into the bamboos determined to go back to work
without delay

He is picking up a bamboo when he hears something on the beach Or rather
he is alerted by a sudden absence of sound As if nature had suddenly fallen
silent

He hurries over there but he cant see anything disturbing the usual calm of
the place The crabs are looking at the sea The man goes over to the shore
Could there be a slight movement in the water

The man has gone back to work
He puts a number of bamboos on the beach to build another raft

The building work progresses well
He soon goes back to the water goes past the coral reef again and heads
out to the open sea This time he should make it

And yet he hears something again
He sticks his head under the water on the look-out He looks closely
Nothing

Time seems frozen for a moment
Just when the danger seems to have passed the raft is struck The thing
seems to be coming from under the water a sort of invisible sea monster
The raft explodes The man sinks

The man emerges amid the remains of the shattered raft

He manages to swim to the coral reef and pauses to catch his breath He
coughs Hes not feeling great

Screenplay 5
The Red Turtle

Birds fly past in the sky

14 Fever and Despair The animals

The man returns to the island spitting copiously

His last escape attempt exhausted him He is alone desperate and injured
The wind is picking up bending the trees and sending sand and leaves flying
on the beach

The man lies down on the sand and curls up

Later
Birds fly past in the sky

The wind has died down

The man is lying on his back in the shade of the bamboos He seems
incapable of movement Exhausted and absent he looks at the sky through
the foliage

The sun sets above the sea on the horizon

Later
An enormous centipede crawls over the dead leaves and the mans
motionless foot He doesnt react He seems to be in a sort of feverish coma

For those who inhabit the island life carries on in a strange fusion with the
sick absent man
Eat or be eaten kill or be killed â€” thats natures way

At the waters edge two crabs fight over a dead fish

Further away a spider waits for a fly to get caught in its web
Ants come and go on the mans motionless arm

He is lying on his belly in the bamboo forest

Night falls

Bats fly over the landscape in the already dark twilight sky

A bat flies around in circles above the foliage Its spread wings stand out
clearly black shadows against the dark grey sky

Its nighttime
Behind the bushes and the bamboos which line the beach eyes appear
Theres no way of knowing who they belong to

Screenplay 6
The Red Turtle
They look closely at the man Waiting for his death To eat him too

We come closer The round unblinking vaguely threatening eyes are still
staring

In the sky clouds pass in front of the almost full moon

Suddenly almost heavenly music can be heard

The man opens one eye He hears it and starts listening to it

He struggles to his feet and heads for the music on the beach
Musicians are sitting there by the waters edge

The man runs over to them They are a string quartet wearing tuxedos

As he reaches the quartet they disappear
The man turns around No theyre elsewhere their feet in the water

He runs over to them The musicians disappear
It was only a dream a dismal mirage

The man goes back onto the beach
He cries and wails alone and abandoned

Fade to black

15 3rd attempt with the raft Appearance of the turtle
Another day has dawned on the island

The man appears on his knees exhausted among the bushes which line the
pond
He plunges his head in the water to drink and clear his head

Still convalescing he walks through the bamboos then remains sitting for a
long while in the water leaning against a rock

Later

He has started to build another raft when he happens upon a dead seal near
the rocks

He skins the animal washes it with plenty of water and dries it in the sun

At nightfall he makes a jacket or trousers out of it

The Red Turtle

Another day
A crab scuttles among the sticks of bamboo on the new raft

The man casts off and climbs onto the boat

The crabs are onboard determined to leave with him

The man drives them away The crabs turn back to the beach and watch the
raft departing

On the raft the man is on the look-out
The boat moves along slowly as there isnt much wind

Then again the danger appears

And for the first time the man sees it

Its an enormous red turtle which seems to want his raft to sink every time
The man readies his weapon trying to get the upper hand in the fight but to
no avail

Once again the monstrous turtle comes up from the depths and shatters the
raft

The man falls into the water and sinks straight to the bottom

When he is under the water the monster swims up to him scaring him

After sinking the mans raft will it try to kill him

The man curls up and heads for the depths But the enormous turtle keeps
coming closer

The man hides his face Through his fingers he can see the turtles enormous
head and round eyes staring at him

Then suddenly for no apparent reason the turtle swims away

The man comes back to the surface gasping for breath
Hes had the fright of his life

Part II The man and the woman-turtle

II 1 Murder of the turtle and bitter regrets

The man returns to the island beside himself with rage Fear has given way
to anger

He throws a rock into the water and shakes a bamboo furiously

He is yelling his rage at the hillside when he sees it again The turtle is on the
beach on his territory

The man races down He comes out of a copse armed with a bamboo runs
over to the turtle and hits it with all his strength The stick breaks with the
force of the blow The seagulls overhead caw at the violence of his act

He lifts up the turtles shell braces himself and with his anger giving him the
strength of ten manages to turn it onto its back

But thats still not enough for him Now he jumps on its belly like a child
having a tantrum then throws sand into its face before striding away

He dives into the sea and bathes for a long time as if washing his hands of
it to forget his act or to regain his self-control

Birds fly above the waves The sun is at its zenith
The man comes back from his swim The crabs scuttle away as he goes past

He walks around the turtle and carries on walking
He starts building another raft a few yards away from the turtle which is still
on its back and looking a sorry sight

Its the middle of the afternoon the sun is beating down The turtles agony
must be terrible but the man doesnt want to think about it He glances at it
from afar then goes fishing for his evening meal

When he comes back from his swim at dusk the crabs scurry away as he
goes past The man is dangerous

And yet his anger has at last subsided

He goes over to the turtle touches its paw and its strange skin

Screenplay 9
The Red Turtle

A few insects buzz around the animal Its paw is no longer moving Maybe its
at deaths door The man hesitates Should he save it

He goes and sits down nearby and holds his head in his hands
The crabs seize this opportunity to pounce on his catch lying at his feet

Then all of a sudden in the middle of the night the turtle flies away
The man runs behind it He tries to stop it but it climbs ever higher in the
sky

The man wakes up It was just a dream

He runs over to the turtle which is still lying motionless on its back dying

He knees down next to it touches its leg and tries with all his strength to
turn it over onto its belly but to no avail

It seems heavier than it was before or maybe the mans strength has
diminished

The man sees the turtles head lolling wretchedly

He runs to fetch his bamboo container and sprinkles some seawater on its
face He does this several times but the animal doesnt stir

The man kneels down beside it shattered

Seen from above the man and the turtle very close to one another form a
strange hybrid creature

II 2 Half-woman half-turtle Care and attention

The man and the turtle have fallen asleep on the sand head to tail

At the first light of dawn a sinister cracking wakes the man

He sits up and stares the turtles shell has split almost right across its belly
Its a horrible sight

The man turns to the sea feeling numb and wretched What do you do when
youre so sad about a death you yourself caused

Just then it happens

When the man looks at the turtle again theres a womans arm instead of the
leg And a womans face and legs are sticking out of the shell He instinctively
recoils The thing is just too supernatural Is it another mirage

But the woman is still there her eyes closed showing no reaction

Screenplay 10
The Red Turtle

The man walks around her peering at her Is she alive

He kneels down touches her forehead and brings his ear close to the
womans mouth He can feel her breath on his cheek She is breathing gently
but regularly

The man gets up to fetch some fresh water As he goes past he picks up the
bamboo container realizes that its heavier than usual throws onto the sand
the two or three crabs that had sought refuge in it and heads for the
waterhole

The crabs approach the half-woman half-turtle creature and look at her face
which is turned to them

The man gets some fresh water from the pond then comes back to the
woman

He kneels down puts an arm under her neck and tries to give her a drink
But her mouth is closed A trickle of fresh water runs down her chin Her lips
have barely even been moistened

The sun appears behind the tall trees
Soon the woman will be too hot

The man picks up a few branches among the bamboos and brings them back
to the beach A crab runs after him to steal a twig

The man hurriedly builds a little canopy that he covers with a branch From
above he can see the womans face through the foliage He shifts slightly to
get a better view of her

Later
The man has finished his canopy A few branches are enough to give the
womans body some welcome shade

Two crabs play around them chasing after each other
Two birds fly past in the sky

Its evening

The man kneels down near the womans face

He puts his hand on her forehead and dampens it with some water
Now he sits cross-legged near the canopy

He watches over her like a sentinel

Screenplay 11
The Red Turtle

The woman seems to be in a deep almost comatose sleep Her face is calm
and gentle as two flies buzz around above her

Seen from above the man keeps watch over her as he looks out to sea

Fade to black

II 3 The woman wakes up and disappears

The island stirs to rain in the grey early morning light

Raindrops lands on the succulent leaves of the tropical plants A lizard slides
between the rocks to take shelter

The man who had fallen asleep near the canopy is woken

The woman is still there motionless

Raindrops drip through the canopy

The man rearranges a half-fallen branch and goes to fetch others to protect
her better

But the rain is a godsend

It drips everywhere like a life force It creeps under the canopy into the
crack in the shell onto the womans lips and onto her hand which moves at
last

When the man comes back weighed down with branches only the shell is
still there
The woman has disappeared

The man runs to the shore Has she gone back into the sea
He walks along the waters edge scouring the waves on the horizon
The hard rain makes the sea inhospitable

And suddenly another idea comes into his head The man changes direction
He walks across part of the bamboo forest and goes to the waterhole

The rain has stopped

The man looks around

In the sunlight three frogs jump into the pond

Yes there are footsteps on the muddy path The marks of bare feet Hers no
doubt about it

Screenplay 12
The Red Turtle

The man hurries over there He follows the footprints which go through a
thick bush which he goes through

The man walks along searching scouring the ground But in vain
The footprints have disappeared
The man carries on looking without holding out too much hope

On the beach a wave ebbs at nightfall
The man is sitting on the sand He lies down

The night is at an end

The man wakes up Did he hear something
He looks around him

Thats when he sees her

Shes a bit further away bathing water up to her shoulders

The man jumps to his feet in delight He goes over to her

But he frightens her The woman bends down Only her eyes are visible
above the waterline

The man stops short He gestures at her to make her understand he wont
hurt her Then she realizes shes naked And modest

He takes off his shirt puts it on the sand and walks discreetly away to the
bamboos He waits listening closely

When he comes back to the beach the woman has gone again

He goes over to the glassy sea then turns on his heels

He looks for her inland more calmly this time looking almost serene He
walks through the bamboo forest and climbs the mound

He sits on the top waiting
Just then he sees her on the beach below just as he saw the turtle the first
time

She has put on his shirt and is pulling her shell over the sand to put it in the
water

She looks up and sees the man staring at her
Time stands still as they exchange their first real glance

Screenplay 13
The Red Turtle

II 4 First tokens of love
The man hurries down the slope Hes afraid hell lose her again

From the shore he watches her enter the water pushing her shell in front of
her The man is worried that she has decided to return to the sea for good
but no the woman turns around exchanges a glance with him and carries
on

Its like a beautiful moving solemn ritual
The woman goes past the coral reef taking her shell as far as possible then
pushes it out to sea

Now the young woman returns to the beach far away from the man
avoiding him She walks off toward the bamboo forest

The man stands there not really knowing what to do

He looks at the horizon then he sees the raft hes building He hurries over
to it Yes thats what hell do hell put his raft to sea too As a token of his
love and of their equal status

He pushes the raft but suddenly he hesitates he stops what hes doing and
he stands back

Then with a determined gesture he goes back to putting the raft in the
water

From afar hiding behind the line of bamboos the woman watches him Her
eyes shine exactly like those of the creature which watched the man in his
sleep

She sees the man go past the coral reef and push his raft out to sea

Is that the flicker of a smile on the womans face

The man floats on his back like a human raft

Night has fallen He sees the canopy of heaven above him and an intense
feeling of joy washes over him He slides under the water and swims in
acrobatic movements

Just then the woman joins him underwater

She comes close to the man changes direction and turns around him
happily

The man looks at her equally delighted even though he doesnt dare to go
too close to her

Screenplay 14
The Red Turtle

The woman goes back up to the surface She waits for him then carries on
swimming
The man and the woman go back to the island in the moonlight

The man and the woman have reached the coral reef

The woman stands on the surface above the water she seems to know the
place well She is leaning over a rock pulling off a mussel The man looks at
her in surprise But his surprise is even greater when he sees the woman
swiftly opening the mussel with an empty shell found on the ground then
gulping it raw

The young woman looks up at him and hands him out an open mussel She
smiles The man hesitates for a moment He accepts the mussel and eats it
as the woman looks at him She keeps on opening mussels The man is
fascinated by the young woman

Suddenly heâ€™s overwhelmed by a thought He turns away and in a mute
flash back he sees again the moment when he violently hit the turtle with a
bamboo This horrible gesture awakes a strong shame in him He raises his
head towards the woman He feels sad and hides his face in his hands

The woman looks at him for a moment motionless then slowly she pulls
the manâ€™s hands away from his face She delicately touches his forehead and
draws his profile with her finger the forehead the nose and the lips As if
she wanted to show her tenderness and discover his face in a single gesture

The woman slowly takes her hand away she stands up and enters into the
water of the lagoon heading to the beach The man is surprised He also
stands up and follows her

The couple walks in a field by the pond a field of high grass bathed by the
light of the moon Crickets are quietly singing and the air doesnâ€™t move The
woman stops and turns back to the man He comes close to her They hug
II 5 They fly

Music

The man and the woman fly in the air Looking at each other

We dont really know anymore if were above or below them in the air or in
the water

Screenplay 15
The Red Turtle

Their bodies come closer in an irresistible physical attraction

Lap dissolve

Part III The Child

III 1 Childhood
Ebb and flow of a wave on the beach

A little crab appears coming out of its hole in the sand

A child comes up He is a few months old maybe nine or ten months less than
a year old

He walks on all fours but moves fast

He notices the crab which is scurrying to its hole for shelter

The child follows it rummages in the hole with its hand pulls out the crab
and puts it in his mouth

Thats no way to go about it The crab pinches him or wriggles in his mouth
The taste is unpleasant and the child spits the crab onto the sand Then
carries on going

A seagull dives down on the half-dead little crab and carries it off

One or two years later

The child is two or three years old

He is sitting astride his fathers shoulders

The family is all together the mother the father and the son They are
walking together along the shore by the waters edge

They have stopped in the middle of the beach
The man and the woman are sitting on the sand making or mending a net
The child is nearby playing with the sand

Then his attention is caught by something near the sea and he runs off
When the mother realizes he has gone she gets up and looks for him

The child is further away by the waters edge Something is of great interest
to him an object washed up by the tide Its a bottle

Screenplay 17
The Red Turtle

The child tries to grab it when a wave washes over his feet and drives him
away

The wave ebbs The child comes back He picks up the bottle (its empty
theres no message in it) and runs off so he doesnt get soaked by the next
wave

The child goes back to his parents to show them his spoils Its a strange
object when youve never seen glass or a bottle before

The mother shows him how to take the top off The child plays with it
Taking it off and putting it back on again Its fun

Then he turns to his father giving him an inquiring look He seems to be
asking him where this object came from and what its doing there

The father stands up and starts to draw on the wet sand

First their island which is easy to recognize by its shape and its inhabitants
three figures two big one small Then further away a much bigger land
more inhabitants unknown animals (a horse an elephant etc)

The mother comes over She draws too but between the two lands the sea
and its fish

The child goes from one to the other looking closely at each drawing each
place He cant seem to believe it

A little later

Seen from a childs point of view the waves seem much bigger

The child paddles in the water uttering little screams

He pulls in his stomach against the waves tiny though they are Its the first
time hes dared to venture into the water

His father and his mother holding his hand are on either side
The three of them stop when the water reaches the childs waist

They look at the horizon and at the great unknown that the child now finds
desirable

Screenplay 18
The Red Turtle

One or two years later
Seagulls fly over the rocks which make up one of the two ends of the island

The mother is there leaning over a crevice in the rock Theres a wild plant
shes trying to pick

She is joined by the father and the child (who is now about four or five years
old)

The father hands a basket to his wife who puts the plant in it while the child
walks off to the edge of rock

He looks at the horizon then at the sea below a turtle is floating on the
water The child points it out to his parents in delight

He sits on the rock to get a longer look at it when some seagulls fly past
cawing and cause him to lose his balance

The child slips

Then falls down the cliff

He finds himself in the waterhole between two steep rock faces where his
father had fallen a few years before

The parents are horrified The father is about to slide down after him but the
mother stops him

The child sinks then recovers and swims underwater exploring the crevice

When he resurfaces his mother gestures at him from the top of the cliff to
turn back he should be able to get through the underwater gully

The child takes a deep breath then dives down to the depths

It goes pretty well He enters the gully like hes being born gain then
emerges on the other side of the rocks

He is swimming up to the surface when he sees the turtle which is now
underwater too

The child hurries back up Did the animal frighten him
No he just catches his breath then goes back underwater

Screenplay 19
The Red Turtle

He approaches the turtle He tries to swim around it but the animal does
likewise They turn slowly around not taking their eyes off each other Like a
silent face-to-face in which they discover and get to know one another

The father is hurrying down the rocky slope when the childs head reappears
above the waves

He dives to join him and hugs him watched by the mother who has now
reached the flat rock at the foot of the cliff

Later

Its evening or late afternoon

The mother is sitting at the top of the beach

The child has fallen asleep in her arms worn out by the excitement of his
day

The young woman looks at the sea serenely Then suddenly she sees
something She looks a vague smile on her face Maybe she even stands up
her child in her arms to have a closer look

Two turtles go past in the distance We see the tops of their backs and their
heads above the waterline

Much further away the moon looks like it is floating on the horizon
Fade to black
III 2 Adolescence
A flock of birds fly in front of the clouds
They go past the big breadfruit tree up which the boy has climbed He is now
12 or 13 He is hanging from a branch as agile as a monkey and drops a
fruit to his father at the foot of the tree who catches it
The fruit is heavy The father puts it down beside him
But already another fruit falls on him unannounced

The father jumps back It nearly hit him on the head

The father shouts at his son to be careful

Screenplay 20
The Red Turtle

The boy was so involved in what he was doing that he hadnt seen the
danger When he realizes what happened he pulls a funny face half-
concerned half-laughing

A little later

The father and son come back through the fields weighed down with fruit
Suddenly the son rubs his fathers head It was quite unexpected The father
retaliates

They put down the biggest fruit and start to run after each other

They fall down play-fight throwing a fruit or two at each other and laughing
their heads off

Rapid fade to black

One or two years later

A general view of the part of the island where the rocks rise up at the base of
the crevice A tiny figure jumps from rock to rock

We move in closer Its the boy hes now about 14

He runs along without looking at his feet in a feeling of total freedom as if
he knew every stone every crack in the rock every slope on this side of the
island

When he reaches the edge of the cliff he runs and jumps diving into the
sea

Its a perfect virtuoso dive The young mans head emerges out of the water
then he swims off rapidly toward the open sea

Under the water

The boy swims just below the surface above a patch of underwater
seaweed

He approaches it brushing against the seaweed with his stomach Its a
pleasant sensation The child laughs Everything is moving and sparkling as
the sun filters through the water and the underwater currents make the patch
of seaweed sway like a wheat field

The boy swims closer to the seabed He picks a little bit of seaweed and eats
it contentedly

Screenplay 21
The Red Turtle

The young mans head shoots out of the water

He catches his breath then glances behind him to get his bearings The
island is in the background but a long way away We may have never seen it
from so far away

The boy dives in again and swims even further out

Under the water
He sees an octopus its tentacles flailing swimming in front of him
He has fun chasing it The octopus speeds up The race doesnt appeal to it

The child swims ever deeper after the animal (The further we get from the
island the greater the underwater depths become)

The sand appears A few coral reefs and starfish

In the end the octopus manages to slides its whole body into a tiny hole
thanks to the lack of a skeleton Its an impressive sight

The child approaches the hole to have a look but already his attention is
caught by something else A gigantic shadow partly covers the underwater
seascape

The boy looks up He catches sight of two turtles swimming on the surface
toward the open sea
The child swims up toward them as fast as he can

On the surface

The child swims between the two turtles Further and further out

He studies them in turn delighted with their company then follows them
when they decide to dive

Under the water

Here the seabed is too deep to be reached

But thats not what interests him

For soon the two turtles join a group of their fellow creatures There are
maybe ten or fifteen of them

Babies and adults Big ones and small ones

Screenplay 22
The Red Turtle

The turtles swim lazily just below the surface all different sizes and ages He
has never seen so many

The boy comes back up to the surface for air then dives again to join them

Later in the day

On the beach the father is worried Night is falling and the child still isnt
back

He peers at the horizon but cant see him

The father joins his wife a little higher up on the beach He gestures
expansively he seems agitated worried feverish

The mother is calmer She looks out to sea shading her eyes with one hand
Confident that the boy will be back Its just a matter of time

The father decides to go off in search of him Anything rather than wait not
doing anything He unties a little raft which they probably use for fishing and
which is by the waters edge and sets off He has a long bamboo stick to
make the flimsy boat move

From the beach the mother watches the father on his raft He is going past
the coral reef

From the sea the boy who is swimming toward the island sees his father in

the distance and gestures to him joyfully

The fathers raft and the boy reach other The father yells at his son He
grabs him and pulls him onto the raft The boy looks a bit sheepish

The raft returns to the beach
The boy is sitting cross-legged at the front He turns his back on his father
who is maneuvering with his stick at the rear
Rapid fade to black
A new day dawns on the island Its a calm carefree day
Two birds fly together

Elsewhere in the sky a bat flies towards the island towards us

Screenplay 23
The Red Turtle

Its a male He approaches a big tree from the branch of which a female bat
is hanging upside down legs in the air

The male lands beside her The female moves away a bit

The male flies off He hovers around the female then lands much nearer her
this time The female doesnt move away
They are almost touching their heads upside down

Another day
In the field near the pond

It has been raining but it has stopped now
A raindrop slides down a leaf and falls onto the wet grass

We move in closer

Two snails are on the ground on bright green leaves which are still glistening
with moisture They are big snails a bit like sea snails

One of the snails sticks to the others shell A sort of trunk comes out of its
body and inserts itself under the others shell

They mate

Another day or later on
A mating ritual is conducted in the waters of the pond

A male frog hops into the pond and joins a female frog

She watched the male coming but takes off as soon as he reaches her

The male swims after her The muscles of their back legs relax in almost
synchronous movements

Then suddenly the female slows down
The male turns joins her and presses tight against her
They swim together clinging to each other

Another day Or the same one
The son is sitting by himself at the top of the beach
Its the middle of the afternoon

Two years have passed since his underwater excursion He is now 16
He is sculpting a piece of wood with a sharp stone But he stops
daydreaming He seems melancholy

Screenplay 24
The Red Turtle

Further away on the beach two crabs chase each other
Then they press themselves against one another

Later Its the end of the day
The boy is still in the same place more or less in the same position Only the
daylight has changed He cant have moved for hours

He picks up the bottle next to him has a drink of water then raises the
bottle in front of his eyes He has fun making the horizon coincide with the
water level in the bottle

Fade to black

III 3 The tsunami â€” The family separated

Its an ordinary day
The whole family is picking up shellfish off the coral reef The son is now a
young man hes 18

The atmosphere is strange electric
Birds whirl in the sky

Kneeling by a rock the boy watches them shading his eyes with one hand
Then he stands up puts the shellfish hes picked up in their basket grabs the
almost empty bottle next to it and heads for the beach to fill it He crosses
the stretch of water which links the coral reef to the island a little surprised
to see that the water level seems to have gone down

The mother also kneeling down watches him go away without giving it a
second thought then looks up at the sky A flock of birds now fly past
cawing

The boy has reached the beach
He goes to the waterhole also looking up at the birds as they fly past him

The edge of the water has shifted
Its very strange It seems that it is ebbing very slowly toward the open sea

Three or four crabs are there on the wet sand

Screenplay 25
The Red Turtle

They look at the sea then they too move back slowly or disappear into their
holes Once the birds have gone past silence descends again We hear more
clearly than ever the tiny sounds of the crabs legs on the sand

The son strides along heading for the pond walking alongside the field
which borders the bamboo forest Suddenly he stops and listens

We cant hear anything The sound of the sea has grown fainter giving way
to a big lull as if nature had fallen silent The young man looks up at the sky
then carries on walking perplexed

On the coral reef the father has stood up

With hands on hips he watches in surprise the stretch of water by the beach
the level of which has gone down again The mother who is still kneeling and
hard at work stands up to join him as the father walks a few paces to get a
better view

There are only a few inches of water left The fish are almost high and dry
The father snatches one

The mother who has stayed on the coral reef watches him then looks up at
the sky We hear a sort of rumbling like a continuous but very distant bass
A storm somewhere far away But the sky is clear

Now the woman turns to the sea She looks at the horizon her face worried
perplexed watchful The horizon doesnt look quite normal There is a darker
grey line between the sky and the sea

The son is now near the pond He plunges his bottle in the water pricking up
his ears as he fills it Something is wrong A distant incomprehensible sound
like a rumbling which keeps getting louder It seems to be coming from the
beach from the sea

The young man turns to the path he came from The noise keeps growing
the rumbling is getting closer The sound slowly gets louder as he puts his
bottle near the pond then he starts running to the beach as fast as he can

The mothers face looks terror-stricken

Its a wave a tsunami

The wave is there on the horizon distant yet close Still distant yet far too
close When you can see it its already almost too late

The woman runs as if possessed She grabs the man by the arm as she goes
past He starts running too though he doesnt really understand what the
danger is

They run on the wet sand between puddles which are all that remains of the
stretch of water which linked the coral reef to the beach

Screenplay 26
The Red Turtle

The father turns around Thats when he sees it He stops for a moment
hypnotized by the waves beauty despite the danger It is very close now

The woman joins her husband pulling him along by the arm
They run from the ever-growing wave

The son has taken the shortest route
He rushes through the bamboos

The mother and father run too We can only see their legs and the reflection
of their running in the shallow water covering the sand

They seem to be gaining ground But just as they exit the frame the wave
comes hurtling after them Its catching up its only a matter of seconds now

The son has nearly reached the last few feet of the bamboo forest when he
trips over a bamboo which is half-buried under the vegetation He goes
sprawling on the ground then picks himself up hurriedly

He races to the beach emerging from the curtain of bamboos

Thats when he too sees it

The wave is there Coming to the top of the beach like a galloping monster
The son turns on his heels

He runs among the bamboos the wave close behind
One after the other like a stack of cards the foliage of the bamboos bends
under the force of the blow

The wave gets everywhere
Its here and there destroying everything in its path

The boy tries to hang onto a bamboo which is suddenly ripped out of the
ground by the wave The bamboo is carried away by the flood and the boy
along with it

Now its the turn of the pond and its surroundings to be invaded by the wave
The water level rises The camera is almost submerged
But suddenly it stops Almost abruptly

Its a vast field of muddy water with torn-out bamboo sticks floating on the
surface

Then with unexpected violence it goes in the other direction The wave
ebbs

Screenplay 27
The Red Turtle

It crosses the landscape from the pond and continues toward the sea

And then its over It has gone

There are dead animals here and there

An enormous lifeless centipede floats just below the surface
A crab on its belly

Not a single bamboo is still standing
They were all torn out of the ground and sliced up rhizomes in the air

A pile of bamboos has formed in the middle of nowhere A crazy construction
a catastrophic stack a giants game of jackstraws

The boy is there buried under the bamboo sticks
But alive

He slips between the cracks climbing out

He emerges almost at the top of the mountain of bamboos
And looks at the islands apocalyptic landscape which stretches out at his
feet Absolutely everything is ruined

The boy goes down cautiously

He crosses what must have been part of the bamboo forest and which is now
a scene of desolation He looks around for the slightest sign of a human
presence

He runs stops looks around then carries on going to the beach
He jumps over the hillock at the top of the beach and hurtles down the sandy
slope

He stops at the waters edge which has gone back to its old position but is
now so full of dead wood bamboo and plant debris of all sorts that the place
is barely recognizable

He looks around in horror

He turns his head left and right He scans the beach in search of his parents
but cant see anything resembling a body

Like him they must have been carried inland by the wave

The young man carries on looking further inland

Screenplay 28
The Red Turtle

He dodges the puddles calling out racing through the devastated landscape
No sign anywhere

He climbs a first hillock and shouts out to his mother and father But he
doesnt get any reply

He climbs higher He runs up the hill and calls out again when he gets to the
highest point on the island
He looks around but cant see anything

But theres no question of giving up

He goes down the hill and crosses other landscapes

There Is that indistinct mass in the middle of large puddles a body
He hurries over But no its just a rock sticking out

The boy continues his journey Where should he go now
Again he heads for the beach as if he couldnt stop returning to the place he
last saw them

It starts to rain A fine rain that drenches you

He goes down the sandy slope then decides this time to cover the whole
beach along the shore

Over there in a corner of the dune with the uprooted bamboos

Theres something there A vague colored dot which could be an item of
clothing

He turns and heads over there

Yes Its his mother Shes lying huddled up

He bends over her scared

But shes alive Only her leg and her face are wounded

She sits up vaguely Shes in shock incredulous and confused She glances
behind her at the island her island which is just a field of ruins

Her son takes her by the shoulders and turns her to face him

Her son tries to pick her up but she pushes him away she can take care of
herself but the son has to find his father as fast as possible

The child goes away

Screenplay 29
The Red Turtle
The woman struggles to stand up She looks like her strength has run out
Just then the boy reappears He takes her in his arms and hugs her

And he sets off
He has gone

He crosses the stretch of water to the coral reef as best as he can pushing
aside all the debris

He climbs onto it and looks at the ocean
III 4 The tsunami The family reunited
Then he dives

Three turtles accompany him preceding him
They all swim together on the surface

Its still raining and theres a lot of debris

The first turtle dives under the water Then the other two then the young
man They continue their journey just below the waterline

Night falls on this strange procession which disappears almost at the horizon
Later

The boy has stopped in the middle of the ocean The search is made more
difficult by the darkness

But he sees something Its the last line of bamboo debris Seemingly the
final point of the ebbing waves If his father is anywhere hes there He
swims over to it

He is in among the debris alone in the middle of the ocean at night and
even he who knows the sea and its pleasures and dangers so well feels a
little lost and abandoned What if he never finds his father

He looks left and right but cant see anything

Finally he dives again He comes across the turtles hangs onto one of them
and comes out on the other side of the line Even further out to sea

The sun rises just above the horizon

Screenplay 30
The Red Turtle

The light is pearly the sea is glassy It looks like a scene from another world
limbo

The child has fallen asleep his head leaning on a turtles shell which is just
above the water

He wakes up and looks at the sun and the horizon
Over there is a tiny dot

We move in closer The father is there his arm clutching a bamboo Only his
face is sticking out of the water His eyes are closed and he seems to be
asleep

But maybe hes in a deeper sleep

The man hears heavenly music in the middle of which a distant cry calls him
Its time He sees the incandescent white light of the sky Hes dissolving into
this whiteness

But the cry becomes insistent The man opens one eye

He sees his son in the distance Is it his son or a mirage

He waves vaguely at him which is a big mistake He has let go of the
bamboo Nothing is holding him up anymore

The image of his son above the water appears for a moment then the sea
floods the screen

The man sinks like a stone

He doesnt resist anymore He doesnt have enough strength to

Sinking thats his destiny

A turtle swims up under the water at full speed
It slides under the mans body
Another turtle appears then another then the boy

Together they take the mans body to the surface They bring him near his
bamboo and put him down The man seems more dead than alive
Yet he is alive

Later
On the coral reef the mother is watching and waiting like a sentinel

She sees them
She jumps headlong into the water
She hugs her husband tightly

Screenplay 31
The Red Turtle

The island is devastated
Three figures move slowly in the middle of what was the bamboo forest

The son supports his father helping him walk
The mother looks sadly at the landscape around her then takes hold of her
husbands hand

In the sky the birds have returned

Later
Its the end of the day

The son guts fish humming softly to himself with his mouth shut
The mother joins him She sits down next to him and prepares the evening
meal with him

The father is lying down a few feet away from them

He sits up

Hes exhausted but he already seems to have recovered some of his
strength

The family has found refuge at the top of the island which wasnt affected by
the wave

All three of them are there Together Alive

Fade to black

III 5 After the tsunami

In the following days or weeks the family gets down to cleaning the island
Things need rebuilding

(These short sequences can be harmonized by some music which would
prolong and accentuate the melody hummed by the son during the previous
scene)

The first scene takes place near the pond

Its a day or two after the disaster
Its very sunny once more

Screenplay 32
The Red Turtle

The waterhole is almost completely overrun by debris of all kinds You can
barely see where it starts and ends

The son is in the water taking out the biggest branches

The mother and father have a net which they use from time to time for
fishing and which we saw them making on the beach the day the son found
the bottle

They are on either side of the stretch of water and skim the surface with the
net to pick up as many leaves and debris as possible

A few days or weeks later
In the bamboo forest

On one side of the path the mother picks up sticks and rhizomes and makes
neat piles She seems to be using considerable energy

On the other side the father and son carry an enormous bundle of bamboo
sticks as best they can They take it to the beach to the end of what was a
vast bamboo forest and which is now a sort of open field dotted with shoots
a few inches high

Birds fly past in the sky above the islands landscape which has changed
quite a lot since the catastrophe

A few days later
On the beach Its the middle of the day

There are two big fires burning quite far from each other

The father is in charge of the one further away the son the nearer one The
mother comes and goes between the beach and the hill bringing new debris
to fuel the fires

The father and son throw everything that can be burned on the fire bamboo
debris rhizomes dead leaves and branches from bushes They dont really
have any tools to get the fire going or to contain it When necessary they
use bamboo sticks which they regularly wet in seawater

The son goes over to his gigantic fire to throw on a new load of plant debris
He is dripping in sweat

End of the music
(or at the start of the next scene)

Screenplay 33
The Red Turtle

Later Near the pond

The vegetation all around still hasnt grown back but the pond itself is
looking in better shape

The son is kneeling beside the water

He cups some water in his hands and splashes it on his face

Then he goes closer and drinks out of his hands Thats when he sees
something at the bottom of the water which has become more or less
transparent again

It sparkles brightly

We move in closer

The bottle is at the bottom of the pond half-buried in the muddy earth near
an aquatic plant Tiny tadpoles wriggle past

The sons hand enters the water grabs the bottle and brings it up to the
surface

Rapid fade to black

Another day
On the beach there is no sign of the big bonfires anymore

Its late afternoon
The son is sitting at the top of the beach his bottle next to him He lies
down

The son is woken by a distant rumbling

He jumps to his feet and looks at the sea

Yes a wave is approaching But its not as high and is going more slowly than
the one from the first tsunami

The boy enters the water He goes to meet the wave Slowly As if it were the
only thing to do

The wave seems almost motionless Waiting
But as soon as the boy enters it it rises like a long intake of breath

It rises higher and higher The boy is first lifted up by the wave then soon
he is swallowed up by it

Screenplay 34
The Red Turtle

He continues to rise up inside the water then reappears almost at the top
Just then the wave stops Its perfectly motionless There doesnt seem to be
any danger

From the top of the motionless wave the boy peers at the beach he sees his
parents far below looking tiny He waves at them and they respond almost
joyfully

Then the son turns and looks at the horizon

When the boy wakes up he realizes that it was of course just a dream The
sun has set

The young man doesnt really knew where he is or in what state of
consciousness What a strange dream

He gets up and goes over to the shore But everything is calm The water
caresses his bare feet

The fathers outline appears behind what remains of the curtain of bamboos
He was probably coming to see his son but something in the young mans
posture stops him He stands in the shade of a bamboo and looks at his son
from behind staring at the horizon Just like the mother nearly twenty years
before watched the father casting his raft out to sea

The son turns away and starts to walk slowly along the shore staring
vacantly lost in thought

The son has turned inland

He walks slowly calmly as if it helps him think He crosses the field of young
bamboo shoots looking up at the sky The Milky Way looks beautiful this
evening

Further on

The son has changed direction again

Now he climbs onto some rocks walking along the line of rocks which leads
to the far end of the island We recognize the place of course They are the
rocks he dived from one day when he was a teenager and the ones he fell
from one morning when he was still a child

He sits down at the far end of the island as if caught in the canopy of
heaven

He thinks as he contemplates the sky

Screenplay 35
The Red Turtle

It is in this silent face-to-face with the stars that he finds the strength to
make his decision

His parents are lying near the place where theyve sought refuge since the
catastrophe the one where they all prepared dinner

They look up at the sound of footsteps
First the mother sits up then the father

They watch their child coming and sitting not far from them
A pause

The young man lowers his head He looks both sad and determined

The mother and father look at him somewhat overcome They understood
that their son decided to leave

The father turns to his wife

The island at night surrounded by the sea under the stars

The dawn sky
An albatross hovers in the first light of day

Its daytime
The son slips his bottle of fresh water into his bag and says goodbye to his
parents All three of them are on the beach

The son hugs his mother then his father
Some crabs watch

The son enters the water

He reaches the coral reef where his three turtle friends are waiting for him
He turns one last time to his parents to say goodbye then dives into the
water and joins the turtles

Standing on the beach the mother and father watch him go

Seen from the sky the child swims off among the turtles

A little later in the day Its still broad daylight

The parents are lying on the grass

The father is on his back the mother is curled up

She cries silently as if the tears wont stop

Screenplay 36
The Red Turtle

The father comes and huddles up against her He puts his arm around her
She squeezes the mans hand and shuts her eyes Maybe she can manage to
sleep now

The big bamboos of the forest swing in the gentle sea breeze

Fade to black

III 6 Old age and death of the parents

Another day The lagoon seen from the sky
The woman and the man swim quietly side by side in the big transparent
space

Lap dissolve
The island in the middle of the ocean
Lap dissolve

The father sits up on the hill He looks much more older now 60 years old
maybe Heâ€™s dreaming lost in his thoughts

He sees something below He looks that is his wife coming back from her
daily sea bath

Sheâ€™s coming up to the beach her eyes are wet sheâ€™s got water until her
waist

She is around 55 but she is perfectly fit Sheâ€™s particularly beautiful as sheâ€™s
getting out of water She sees him and sends him a lovely smile

The man smiles in return

Lap dissolve

Migrating birds fly past above the sea

Seen from the top itâ€™s a cloud of silent birds passing as many points from an
abstract composition

Lap dissolve

The big field The couple have a stroll in the high grass The woman holds
her manâ€™s arm

Screenplay 37
The Red Turtle

Lap dissolve

The beach lightened by a sunset
The man and the woman are around 80 and 75 years They walk slowly
along the seashore towards us

The woman stops

The man does one or two more steps then he turns back to her
interrogatively

The woman stretches out her two hands towards him as if to invite him to
dance

The man hesitates and eventually lets it go

They dance a little waltz just like it for nothing for fun on the beach

Lap dissolve

Night

The old man is lying on his back on the beach heights The woman is asleep
not far from him

He watches the starred sky

He turns his head to the ocean

His eyes close slowly

The woman wakes up she feels that somethingâ€™s changed She sits next to
the man and touches tenderly his motionless face

She looks down She is very sad

The lagoon The quiet moment just before dawn

The woman is standing up in the lagoon the still water reaches her waist
She lets her down in the water until sheâ€™s completely submerged

Only her long floating hair is visible on the surface

She stands up

A moment later the woman sits next to the manâ€™s body She watches the
ocean The sun rises

She lies down on the sand close to the man and softly lies down her hand
into the open hand of the man

Screenplay 38
The Red Turtle

The hand of the man and the arm of the woman united turn into a turtle
paw

The woman is again a big red turtle

The turtle turns slowly towards the sea
It descends the beach

When she reaches the edge she lets herself slip into the water quietly and
begins to swim towards the horizon

During a few seconds the top of the shell is still visible before getting down
under the smooth surface

The turtle disappeared into the ocean

THE END
