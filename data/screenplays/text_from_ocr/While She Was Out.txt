MAP GRIDS

From the pages of a Thomas guide converge overlap and re-
configure across the screen The endlessly ironic names of
American suburbs parade before us their violet territories
marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of
forest and wilderness

Closer in on one last map grid which fades into a
transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of
the suburb The name of this housing development is Pleasant
Valley The transparency fades out to reveal

EXT PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING

From a sign reading Pleasant Valley Dream Homes a picture
postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity

Each home is brand new Each has the same size lawn the same
shrubs the same satellite dish Each has an
indistinguishable car parked in the driveway

All the homes have Christmas decorations Christmas trees
with baubles lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at

the top The doors have Christmas wreaths

The sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer
in the lights

We halt outside one house
EXT DELLASS HOUSE - EVENING

This home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas
star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting
itself in a puddle on the wet lawn

Suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl
among the branches of the Christmas tree It rises from the
tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse
from the grass The owl then soars off casting a magnified
shadow of her wings across the house and disappears with
its prey into the woods behind

Curtains part at a downstairs window The silhouette of a man
appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen He
draws the curtains once again and disappears

INT DELLAS HOUSE KENNETHS MEDIA ROOM - EVENING

We sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office
fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer

Scene 3 Page 2

KENNETH a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face
pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass Kenneths eyes are
glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll
endlessly down He highlights a set of numbers and stands up
abruptly from his chair elated

KENNETH
Yes

Steps back onto a A CHILDS DOLL crushing it underfoot His
ebullient mood changes quickly

KENNETH (CONTD)
Damn DELLA

The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening
DELLA peers into the room Shes a diminutive blonde in her
thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent
Shes pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans

She sees the broken doll
DELLA

SHOOT KENNETH Thats Tammis
favorite doll
She walks in picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed
face He turns back to the computer guiltily takes a sip of
beer

KENNETH
You should just swear properly and
get it over with Do you think the
kids dont know what you mean

Close up his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks
too much He turns back towards her She ignores him
continues to try fix the doll His eyes linger on her coat

KENNETH (CONTD)
Going out again What is it
tonight Auto Mechanics for
Dummies The bored housewives
reading group

He averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look
at her once more

KENNETH (CONTD)
I got a new one for you

He smiles sardonically

Scene 3 Page 3

KENNETH (CONTD)
Group therapy for women who always
have the curse Theres a Tuesday
night class at the Pleasant Valley
Episcopalian

Kenneth clearly thinks hes funny Della glares a warning at
him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping
from her mouth

DELLA
Im going to the mall for wrapping
paper

A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches
Kenneths eye

KENNETH
What do you do all day Della
honey Cause it sure isnt keeping
house This place is an eyesore
rr

Im mortgaged up to the eyeballs
for this

His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation Della determined
not to engage averts hers Kenneth unable to contain
himself faces her

KENNETH (CONTD)
I mean its not like youre at some
salon fancying up your hair or
nails like the other mens wives

He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop
looks right in her tired face

KENNETH (CONTD)
The last time I saw you wearing
something sexy was our engagement
party God Della you used to be
hot

She bites her lip again but this time to try stop the tears
He turns away in an attempt to conceal his own sadness

She walks away clutching the doll

DELLA
Put the twins to bed by eight Give
them a chocolate cookie with their

milk
Scene 3 Page 4
KENNETH
Jesus Della Della honey Im
sorry

But shes already left the room He watches her pick up a set
of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway Her
knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them

Kenneth turns back to his computer

INT STAIRS - EVENING

Della climbs the stairs Framed photographs on the wall tell
the public story of her life The engagement to Kenneth
their wedding the birth of the twins Kenneths graduation
Kenneth as a sixth grade football star Della on the farm in
Ohio with her horse a really young Della playing baseball
with her father We linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty
something Della in a little black dress

INT THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING

TERRI and TAMMI are seven year old twins with the delicate
blue eyed blonde looks of their Mother

Della stands in the doorway and watches them

Tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons
Terris toy dinosaurs are destroying Tammis heirloom dolls
house starting with the furniture

She steps into the room

TAMMI
Mommy can I get an American Girl
for Christmas

TERRI

DELLA
You better leave Santa a note Its

She gives them each a kiss breathing in their scent she
loves so much

TAMMI

Della gives them a little wave and turns to leave

DELLA (CONTD)
Ill check in on you both when I
get back
(beat)
To make sure youre sleeping

She smiles Terris already turned back to his dinosaurs
Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing shes been
working on Its a drawing of a stick figure family holding
hands The words Mommy we love you are written across a
cloudy night sky like big stars

DELLA (CONTD)
Thank you Tammi its wonderful

Della doesnt have time to look at it properly so she folds
the drawing up and puts it in her pocket She kisses Tammi

again and turns to leave Tammis eyes follow her mother as
she walks away

INT STAIRWAY - EVENING

Della checks her watch and hurries down the stairs

INT HALLWAY - EVENING

She sits on the bottom stair to pull on a pair of boots The
boots are well worn but polished to a gleam

Scene 7 Page 6
Behind her an antique grandfather clock strikes seven pm

The sound of gun shots fades in from the TV in Kenneths
office

INT KITCHEN - EVENING

Della collects a packet of cookies from a cabinet She looks
at the pile of dirty dinner dishes in the sink then looks
away

Della leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and
opens the front door The TV blares out some action flick
from Kenneths ajar door

TITLE --- WHILE SHE WAS OUT

EXT DELLAS HOUSE - EVENING

Della is met by a blast of cold evening air and the eerie
silence of the suburbs She closes the door softly behind her
and rushes along the path to the driveway where the familys
black Ford Explorer is parked

She CHIRPS the remote and quickly climbs in

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Della inserts the key and turns it in the lock The car
sputters in defiance against the cold night

DELLA
Frick

The car sputters again

DELLA (CONTD)
CMON

With a massive exertion the car engine turns over and the
vehicle starts She sighs with relief

She turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent
pauses to look at her home through the car window For a
second in an upstairs window she sees a reflection of

Tammi
She smiles then looks at the house and lawn and the
Christmas tree She notices the fallen star is about to get

out of the car to retrieve it but decides its too cold

Scene 11Page 7

A shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into
reverse and backs up

EXT PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING
We follow her as she backs up pushes into drive and heads
slowly down the boulevard
The road is empty All the cars are neatly tucked away in
their driveways and it looks like no ones out tonight She
makes a right turn onto

EXT PLEASANT VALLEY CRESCENT - EVENING
She follows the road as it curves around a long row of
endlessly monotonous houses In the distance we can see the
gates of Pleasant valley gated community

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She slows down rolls down her window and swipes a chub card
against the security panel The gates slowly open She drives
through The gates close behind her She rolls the window up
and makes a left turn onto

EXT PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING

The road is wider and framed on either side by the high walls
of gated communities A Ford Explorer just like hers passes
in the opposite direction

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Della smiles mysteriously reaches into the glove compartment
with her free hand She pushes aside a bunch of car papers a
flare pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath - her
secret hiding place for
A nice pack of Marlboros She smiles again - the smile of the
secret smoker She presses the cigarette lighter into the
dashboard

The lighter pops out She tips out a cigarette sees a
sticky note attached to the interior foil Scrawled in messy
handwriting are the words - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE QUITTING
DELLA HONEY XOXO KENNETH

DELLA
Ill get right on that Kenneth
honey AFTER you stop drinking

Scene 16Page 8

She rips the note off stuffs it in her purse lights the
cigarette

She inhales deeply We see the pleasure written across her
face

EXT PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING

A few cars pass Della in the night Their lights are like
torches in the suburban wilderness

INT FORD EXPLORER EXT PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING

There is the familiar ring of a cellular phone Della has
programmed one of those oh so cute recognizable tunes into
it like the William Tell overture

Della holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her
purse with the other She eventually locates the phone

Scene 18Page 11

Della stops at the red light She clicks off the phone and
lets it lay on her lap

She rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat
casts aside an anorak mittens a sock

She finds what shes looking for a bottle of water caught
on the bar under the passenger seat Its only a third full
but she takes a sip recoils from its coldness

The light changes She throws the bottle into the back seat

A billboard for another new housing development announces

Della lets it drop onto her lap She opens the window and
flicks out the remains of her cigarette She waves her hands
to fan away the smoke She closes the window again

Shes about to hide her cigarettes again when she changes her
mind and stuffs them directly into her purse

As the car approaches the cusp of the hill she slows down to
stare ahead

EXT MALL PARKING LOT ENTRANCE - EVENING

Southeast Plaza The day before Christmas Eve Hell on
Earth
A large sprawling parking lot full of cars Nothing but

cars A sea of cars

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
For a second Della contemplates turning around and leaving
The guy in the SUV behind her beeps She steps on the gas

DELLA
Okay okay

Her car careens slowly down hill to the lot

EXT MALL PARKING LOTINT FORD - EVENING

The road spits her out in front of the Mall entrance where
revellers and shoppers are entering and exiting

Della follows several cars down the first long row of parked
cars

The asphalt is wet from the recent rainfall Puddles gather
in its dents and hollows

She passes car after densely parked car There isnt a space
in sight She reaches the end of the row and indicates left
turns down the next row ploughs through a rain puddle which
splashes up onto a MOTHER whos walking her little GIRL and
BOY back to their car The woman shouts at Della

MOTHER
Watch where youre going

Della rolls down her window

Scene 24Page 17

DELLA
Sorry

The Mothers weighed down with shopping bags She glares at
Della and drags her kids across the aisle in front of her

Della sighs drives down the second aisle

An Escape midway down the row blocks traffic Its waiting
for a Subaru to pull out so it can take the spot

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
DELLA
Lucky son of a
The Subaru exits the spot slowly Della taps her impatient
fingers against the steering wheel

EXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

The Subaru pulls away and the Escape snaps into the empty
space

Della continues her journey down to the end of the row There
are no spaces

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
It dawns on her that parking up close to the entrance just
isnt going to happen She takes the last puff from the
cigarette burning out in the ashtray

EXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING
Using the side aisle she scoots past row three and four as
they all flow one way
At the end of this row a confrontation is brewing Several
cars block each other Horns blast An angry DRIVER screams
at another
ANGRY DRIVER
If you think youre gonna steal my
spot think again asshole

INT FORD EXPLOREREXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

Della looks on for a moment at the confrontation She grinds
out the stub of her cigarette into the ashtray slams it
closed

Scene 29Page 18

Della shakes her head and turns left into row five Jesus
Are there really this many cars in Pleasant Valley Its a
brand new Mall and the only one around for miles but this is
ridiculous

Della reaches the end of row five quickly She guessed there
wouldnt be a spot so shes driving faster

She notices a portly middle aged RENT-A-COP directing traffic
ahead She lowers her window

DELLA
Hello

The Rent-a-Cop stops directing and approaches the car

RENT-A-COP
Can I help you

DELLA
Do you know where I can definitely
find parking

RENT-A-COP
Theres nothing close by Even the
valets backed up You might want
to try further out

He points off into the distance through the sea of cars

RENT-A-COP (CONTD)
But be willing to walk

A car waiting behind Della honks its horn loudly and the Rent-
A-Cop saunters away Della guns the Ford down row eight

EXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

At the end of this row Della decides to take the Rent-A-
Cops advice She makes another left at the aisle and skips
several more rows She heads down to the third from last row

INT FORD EXPLOREREXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

Cars cars If she never sees another car it will be too
soon

Della spies a spot halfway down the row

DELLA
Yes

Scene 31Page 19

She guns the engine gets ready to pull in and is DENIED

Somebody has parked an enormous old gold Plymouth so badly
its taking up TWO spaces

DELLA (CONTD)
Unbelievable

She brakes in the nick of time and sighs deeply Shes
starting to lose her patience now

EXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

With no options left Della heads down to the very last row
More cars fill the spaces And then - two spots The last

two spots in the car park They overlook undeveloped land
just beyond the mall Small concrete bumps signify the end of
each space

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
Della whips the car into the first one She sighs with
relief as she straightens the car up into the spot She sits
for a second trying to calm herself down but it isnt
working She reaches for another cigarette then talks
herself out of it
She fastens her coat grabs her purse and opens the door

EXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

Steps down from the Ford right into a puddle The dirty water
splashes up onto her pants

DELLA
GREAT

She shakes the boot off and looks over at the mall Its at
least a half mile away glimmering in the distance

She sets off marching across the lot taking what seems to be
the most direct route Maybe she can shake off this mood by
the time she gets inside

She passes the Plymouth turns stares back at it The car is
dirty gold and riddled with rust holes with a vinyl roof
thats almost peeled away She walks up close tries to
decipher the plate but its caked with mud

Annoyance rises like bile in her throat

Scene 34Page 20

She finds herself reaching into her purse rummaging for a
small notebook then a sharpie She leans on the car as she
writes

DEAR JERK ITS GREAT YOU COULD USE UP TWO PARKING SPACES ON
A NIGHT LIKE THIS EVER HEAR OF THE JOY OF SHARING SIGNED
A CONCERNED FRIEND

She scans her words Pretty good

Della rips the piece of paper from the notebook folds the
note several times and slides it under the Plymouths
windshield wipers The driver cant miss it

She smiles That felt good

Head held high she marches on towards the Mall

The CAMERA pulls up so we can see the mall see Della
marching across the lot see the crowds of shoppers entering

and exiting the mall and get the feeling that maybe somebody
just saw her

EXT MALL ENTRANCE - EVENING

Shoppers are buying freshly felled Christmas trees from a
vendor Della squeezes past and pushes through the mall
doors

INT MALL - EVENING

A wave of heat and Christmas lights hits Della A wave of
nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last
minute shoppers Distorted muzak versions of Christmas songs
seep from invisible speakers

Della gets caught up in a line of children waiting to see
Santa in his grotto She squeezes through and makes her way
towards the fountain outside of Victorias Secret

En route she is stopped by a perfume sales lady who sprays
her wrist with perfume before she has time to protest

PERFUME SALES LADY
Its a classic revival of Chanel
No5 We have a wonderful Christmas
Special on offer at Macys

She hands Della a sample and flyer

Scene 36Page 21

DELLA
Thanks

Della arrives at the fountain A piddling jet of dirty water
gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down
into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes She scans
the crowd but theres no sign of Cassie

Della sits at the edge of the fountain She checks her watch
then checks out the people milling around in front of
Victorias Secret where mannequins in skimpy festive
underwear are propped seductively in the window displays

Still no sign of Cassie Shes about to make a wish and throw
a quarter into the fountain when a Red Cross worker shakes
her Save the Children tin at her Della sticks the quarter
into the tin instead

INT VICTORIAS SECRET - EVENING

Della wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching
men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women

examine slim fit underpants and padded bras

She notices a pure silk black teddy very classic no frills

She lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in
front of the mirror tries to imagine herself in it

A young SALES ASSISTANT approaches

VS SALES ASSISTANT
Its pure silk the last one in our
classic black label collection
Would you like me to fix you a
changing room

Della checks the size tag It reads 36C two sizes too big
And the price tag next to it Ouch Its expensive for
Victorias Secret

DELLA
No thanks Not my size

She gestures to her small boobs smiles and hands the teddy
to the sales assistant She quickly leaves the shop

INT MALL - EVENING
Della checks one last time at the fountain for Cassie She
tries to dodge the crowd as she makes her way toward a
generic coffee shop Maybe Cassie will be there
Scene 39Page 22

INT COFFEE SHOP - EVENING

Harried women and a few men clutching bags full of gifts and
impatient children stand on line for their favorite drug

Della squeezes past them to look for Cassie Every seat at
every booth is full but theres no sign of her friend

Della joins the line She finds herself biting at her nails
a bad habit since childhood

A woman in front of her places an order then moves on to the
pick up area Della moves up to the counter to where an
OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT waits on her

DELLA
A latte please

She notices some chocolate covered biscotti on the counter

DELLA (CONTD)
And a chocolate biscotti

She catches sight of herself in the mirror behind the
counter Kenneths right about one thing she looks awful

Seeing herself in the mirror changes her mind about the
biscotti

Scene 40Page 23

INT MALL - EVENING

She passes a hair salon and presses her face to the steamy
windows Inside women are getting their hair styled and
their nails manicured at the same time

Della looks down at her bitten nails but just cant bring
herself to go inside

She turns around to see LYNN MONROE a pretty well groomed
redhead about her age

LYNN (CONTD)

She gives Della a fake kiss and rushes into the salon

Della chucks her half finished coffee into a nearby trash can
and walks on through the Mall

INT PHARMACY - EVENING

Della enters a pharmacy She locates the wrapping paper
aisle She sweeps up a bunch of rolls at three for ninety
nine cents She feels the texture of the paper its thin and
looks gaudy so she puts them all back Instead she selects
some expensive gold paper with silver embossed stars and
matching silver ribbon She then finds some jolly childrens
wrapping with Christmas tree designs and a great big red bow

She browses through the aisles of cards She sees some cute
cards for the twins and then arrives at the To my Darling

Husband at Christmas section She opens some of the cards

and recoils from the sentiments contained inside

She catches a groomed BLONDE HOUSEWIFE staring at her and
corrects her facial expression from one of revulsion to a
complicit Stepford smile

DELLA

Its a pity they dont have any To
a bastard at Christmas cards

The woman looks at Della like shes a lunatic Della chuckles
to herself

She finds the feminine hygiene aisle and picks up a pack of
regular tampax

She gathers her stuff and carries it to the checkout where a
TIRED MAN and his TWO KIDS wait before her on the line

Scene 41Page 25
The man tries to remove a snow globe with a tiny house and
Christmas tree inside from the clutches of his young son

Scene 43Page 26

A group of CAROL SINGERS sing Silent Night
CAROL SINGERS
Silent Night Holy Night All is
calm All is bright

Della listens for a moment Their voices are clear and
bright

Behind them she can see the Christmas tree vendor bag up the
left over trees

Dellas hands start to pinch with the cold

She gathers her bags of wrapping paper and sets off across
the emptying lot The last of the shoppers rush across the
car park to find their cars Its pretty dark between the dim
pole lamps and the car lights

She slows down at the second aisle for a car to pass then
another Marches on

A man and his little girl walk past He nods Dellas eyes
linger on the little girl She really wants to get home to
the kids

The singers voices echo faintly through the night

CAROL SINGERS (0S) (CONTD)
Holy infant so tender and mild

She walks faster almost at a dash

Where is her car Even further out than she remembered
thats for sure

A car alarm goes off in the distance

The alarm stops at last as Della approaches the outer section
of the parking lot

CAROL SINGERS (0S) (CONTD)
Shepherds quake at the sight

Glories beam from heaven afar

She cuts between some of the cars in row eight Zigzags
across aisle nine Notices the Plymouth still parked ahead

She stops for a split second Then approaches Glances at the
windshield The note is gone

Scene 43Page 27

Maybe it fell off She checks the ground around the car No
sign of it She shrugs who cares anyway

She cuts across the next aisle Its almost empty And the
one after that Her Explorer is sandwiched between two cars
in this otherwise empty row

CAROL SINGERS (0S) (CONTD)

She chirps the remote twice and pops the trunk places the
bags inside She slams the trunk closed and hurries to the
drivers side climbs in pulling the door closed behind her

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Della turns the key in the ignition and presses in the
lighter She lights a cigarette and inhales as she lets the
car warm up for 30 seconds

She rests the cigarette in the ashtray while she releases the
hand brake and slips the gear into reverse The interior of
her car is suddenly flooded with light from another cars
headlights She glances in the rear view mirror A car is
blocking her

DELLA
Good Lord What now

She steps on the brake and waits for the car to move

But it doesnt Its headlights flick to full beam blinding
her view in her car mirrors She honks her horn The car
still doesnt move

Dellas really angry now She slips the gearshift into park
and steps out of her car

EXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

Della squints in the blinding headlights The front of the
car looks familiar Its the gold Plymouth

Two unseen car doors click open and clunk shut again
The lights abruptly go out Della blinks her eyes try to

adjust to the dim mercury illumination from a pole lamp a few
car lengths away
She uneasily turns back to her car

Scene 45Page 28

CHUCKIE (0S)

Its a young male voice The statement stops Della dead in
her tracks

CHUCKIE (0S) (CONTD)
Hows about I aim it at your pussy
first

The words are emphasized by another boys shrill giggling
Della freezes This cant be happening

Her eyes are adjusting The glare phantoms drift out to the
limit of her peripheral vision and vanish

She sees three boys in front of her then a fourth but she
doesnt see any gun

DELLA

his fingers along the hood of the rusty gold Plymouth

Dellas eyes quickly scan the group for sign of the gun She

wearing Chuckies parka hood up covering his face startles

Della

HUEY

Della sidesteps him reaches the back of her car

RENT-A-COP (0S)
Any trouble here maam
Everyone turns to see a Rent-a-Cop puffed up like a pigeon
in his fur trimmed jacket and Russian style cap Its the
same guy Della approached earlier when she was looking for
spaces except this time his hand is laying casually across
the unsnapped holster flap at his hip

DELLA
Not if these delinquents move their
barge so I can back up

RENT-A-COP
How about it boys

Chuckie smiles and nudges Tomas who starts dancing in a real
mocking manner imitating the Rent-a-Cop

Scene 45Page 31

Chuckie pulls a gun from deep in his army jacket pocket and
points it straight at the Rent-a-Cops face

CHUCKIE
Nah We not in the mood

Chuckie looks at his friends for approval Huey laughs again
shrill Tomas grins Vinh hunches and looks around

The Rent-a-Cop backs away

RENT-A-COP
For Jesus sake

Tomas takes off a small crucifix from around his neck and
dangles it in front of the Rent-a-Cop

TOMAS
Say yo prayers old man

Chuckie grins at Della while keeping the gun pointed straight
at the Rent-a-Cop

CHUCKIE
These Rent-a-Pig companies are too
lame to give their foot soldiers
any ammo Liability laws and all
that Tough shit

The Rent-a-Cop goes for his pistol anyway

Chuckie shoots him in the face
THIS MOMENT CHANGES EVERYTHING
We thought Della was in trouble but now we know she is

The bullet hits the Rent-A-Cop in the forehead Blood spurts
from the exit wound He slumps to the asphalt like a
marionette whose strings have just been cut Bullet smoke
hangs in the air where he once stood Smoke too blackens the
bullets entry wound Blood puddles out from the back of his
head

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Fuck

Its clear that Chuckies been acting harder than he is The
hand that holds the gun is trembling The color drains from
his face

All stand riveted in shock

Scene 45Page 32

A deathly silence follows The carol singers can be heard in
the distance faintly finishing up Silent Night

CAROL SINGERS (0S)
Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in
heavenly peace

Chuckie looks to his friends for support but none is
forthcoming

The Rent-A-Cops body twitches

Chuckie hesitates then raises the gun He aims and fires The
shot shatters the top of the Rent-A-Cops head Chuckie
flinches closes his own eyes in reflex

Della swallows If she started screaming now she may never
stop She spins instead and makes for her car door Shes

dead if she doesnt get out of here and she knows it

VINH
Shes busting a move

Chuckie opens his eyes Vinh points to Della

Chuckie looks over and sees Della disappear through the door
of her Explorer Agitation overwhelms him
CHUCKIE
She aint going nowhere We got her
Ford blocked in right

He looks at Vinh who nods then at Huey

HUEY
I dont know nothing

Chuckie looks back at Vinh then over at Tomas

TOMAS
(muttering)
Dar candela por el culo

CHUCKIE

windshield right

No one answers Chuckie turns once more to the Rent-a-Cop
whose body still twitches in some final death throe

Another shot explodes into the night

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Della flinches but no bullet tears through the back of her
skull She slams into the drivers seat and punches the door
lock switch She hits the four wheel drive button and presses
the accelerator pedal to the metal

The Explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and
bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier The barrier
screeches along the underside of the frame There is a loud
SCRAAAAAPE noise as the car heaves over the barrier Then
the rear wheels bounce and claw over The car fishtails
momentarily

DELLA
Please God Dont overcorrect

She releases the pressure on the accelerator The Explorer
straightens

the unfinished outskirts of the car park behind them

Vinh tugs at Chuckies sleeve

But Chuckies staring at the bloody mess he made with a
faraway look in his eyes like hes disassociating

Vinh throws down the stub of his cigarette follows Tomas

the parking lot and exits onto the service road

EXT SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

Della speeds down the long dark empty service road which
skims the deserted warehouses at the back of the Mall
Between the warehouses are dark patches of undeveloped land -
No Mans land

Not a car nor a person in sight

Scene 48Page 35

It starts to rain

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She shakes the cell phone trying to revive its dead battery
Types 911 in anyway No connection No response She shakes
it some more Gives up

She relentlessly checks the rearview and side mirrors as she
races into the rainy night

The driving conditions are not good poor visibility ahead
Too bad She speeds anyway

The road has to connect to a main road soon

Another glance in the rearview Nothing Side mirror Still
clear Once more in the rearview Headlights

DELLA
No

Side mirror Its the Plymouth
She presses the accelerator down harder The engine revs

In the rearview theres a sudden flash above her rear left
headlight And another

DELLA (CONTD)
Jesus

Theyre shooting at her

Della steps the accelerator to the floor praying the Explorer
wont skid out The engine struggles catches up

The sudden speed causes a small silver love heart hanging on
a silver chain necklace from the rearview mirror to crash
against the window The catch bursts open to reveal two tiny
photos of the twins inside The necklace flies back and forth
against the window as the Explorer races onwards

EXT SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

The Plymouth accelerates behind blasting rap Its thick tires
plow along the wet asphalt gripping to the road below in
steady pursuit Its windows are all steamed up The front
passenger window is open a hand and a gun muzzle stick
through

Scene 51Page 36

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Another flash and Dellas left side mirror shatters

She swerves in panic Her car almost hits the ditch

This cant be happening Not to her

She reclaims the steering wheel Straightens up Hits the
accelerator again

EXT SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

The Plymouth swerves behind on the skid that Della created
corrects itself just before the ditch

Della gains speed The Plymouth lags

A stop sign appears ahead The roads ending

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Right or left Della Make a choice

EXT SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

There is no choice A barrier blocks the left hand turn A
big sign reads LOT FULL

EXT EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE ROAD - EVENING

Della swings right instead

The streetlights recede behind her

EXT EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

Nothing but the darkness of a housing complex under
construction ahead

But she seems to have shaken off her pursuers

She speeds down the road looking intently for any sign of
life But theres nothing but half-built houses empty
houses houses just like hers

EXT SEVEN ELEVEN MINI MALL - EVENING

A Seven Eleven sign appears She slows down But it may as

well be a mirage its an unfinished building with only the
sign in an unfinished mini-mall

Scene 58Page 37

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Close to screaming now she speeds up

EXT EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

More empty houses in varying stages of construction No sign
of life

EXT FILLING STATION - EVENING

Then what looks like a filling station one light on in the
kiosk

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Hope She pulls in and dims her lights drives right up to
the kiosk door

Hope dashed

EXT FILLING STATION - EVENING

Its in its final stages of installation but definitely not
functioning And theres no one there

EXT EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

Back onto the road and she sees far behind her car
headlights that can only belong to the Plymouth following
her through the darkness

She dims her lights to just the side lights Hurtles along
the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher Potholes
filled with mud and rain water splash against the car

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Her wipers struggle to cope She can hardly see through the
front window

EXT ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

The potholes yawn deeper The asphalt ends Gravel
deteriorates to dirt

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She steers the Ford blindly

Scene 67Page 38

EXT ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

A wooden barrier with reflective stripes looms suddenly
ahead

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car PLOWS into
the barrier

Theres a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays
around her

EXT EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

The Explorer SLAMS through and VEERS towards a clump of
trees

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Della tries to sit upright but the autos spinning too fast

EXT EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

The car swings then CRASHES right into a Pine tree

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

The Car stalls out SILENCE A prolonged moment

Then Della crawls out from under the dashboard sweeping pine

needles and glass from her hair She reaches up and hits the
light switch

Pine branches protrude through the broken windshield

Using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the
drivers seat and sits down

She slides the gear into park turns the key The engine
groans like a dying animal then gives up

She takes a deep breath

She tries again The engine groans again another death
rattle It just wont catch

She switches off the interior light and pushes the driver
door open She steps out of the car

Scene 73Page 39

EXT EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

She closes the door behind her sos not to trigger the light
switch Finds her legs are giddy Holds onto the door frame
for a moment to steady herself

t looks like shes crashed at the very end of the housing
development - where it cuts like a knife edge into an old
forest
The dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier into the
midst of the forest Behind her shrouded in darkness houses
in different stages of development dot the deforested
landscape Land moving trucks sit on recently flattened

land waiting to tear into the next layer of forest

Patches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light
from the moon which hides in an overcast sky

Jesus Shes driven all the way from the Mall only to find
herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths
on her tail

This must be some sick joke

Speaking of which where are these little bastards Her eyes
scan the darkness for a sign Nothing That doesnt mean
theyre not close by

She checks out the damage to the car by feel The drivers
side is scratched and dented The front is wedged into the
tree

The only way out is for her to back up the car

She climbs back in for another try

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
Della turns the key It barely even groans this time Just a
faint gurgle Then gone
She rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare
sticks it in her pocket
She leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk

EXT EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

Della runs outside to the back of the car and feels about in
the trunk

Scene 75Page 40

She throws carrier bags full of wrapping paper to the side as
she searches Pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then
a small tool box

She hears the screech of a cars wheels spinning in mud

EXT ROUGH ROAD - EVENING
Della turns to see headlights in the distance on the road
behind pointing upwards
DELLA
Huh
The Plymouth must have skidded and got stuck in the mud

EXT EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

She closes the trunk softly then runs to the front of the
car clutching the toolbox and the wrench She reaches back
into the car and unlatches the hood from underneath the dash
Pop She softly closes the door again Punches her way
through the branches Slides her fingers under the hood
pries up the lever It pops up only a few inches

DELLA
Damn

She tries to manually lift it But its heavy with the weight
of pine branches

Voices drift towards her

TOMAS (0S)
Keep hitting on the gas and you
gonna dig them wheels into a dirt
grave

CHUCKIE (0S)
Save yo talk and get out and push

The sound of car doors opening feet squishing into the mud
and cussing The boys materialize in the light from the
headlights

TOMAS
Hell no

HUEY

Scene 77Page 41

CHUCKIE (0S)
Whats aggravating you now

HUEY

Della drops the hood It makes a faint squeak but doesnt
slam down seems its stuck open these last few inches

TOMAS
Yo talk a real mob threat Chuckie
But what if she gone already

Chuckies eyes scan the housing estate

CHUCKIE
She aint gone

Della frantically sweeps pine branches and cones from the
hood But some larger branches are jammed wedged by the

broken tree

When she looks back over for the boys she sees the car
headlights are off and theres no sign of them

Scene 77Page 42
She stands stock still listening scanning the landscape for
a sign of them
The sound of glass shattering breaks the silence

Della jumps out of her skin spins around Her eyes settle on
a light in the distance

EXT ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

The light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving
truck The cabin glows like a box in the darkness Theres a
figure inside its Chuckie Hes inspecting a powerful
construction flashlight He switches settings from broad
light to concentrated beam He points the beam through the
broken glass window onto Tomas whos standing on a truck
tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow
Chuckie leaps down through the broken window pleased with
his find

He switches it to broad beam whistles

CHUCKIE
Wont be long before we find her
now This baby could spot a needle
in a haystack

The light dances around illuminating each of their faces for
seconds at a time Eerie distorted glimpses Theyre
traipsing along the rough road through the mud towards
Della Their voices grow louder

HUEY
We caught up in this bitchs life
like a soap opera We could just
bail blast out of town like we was
never here

CHUCKIE
This boy loves weed so much he
tried to marry Juana

HUEY
Aint no one cares about the Rent-a-
Pig He just collateral damage to
the peeps at the mall

Chuckie pushes Huey half playfully half annoyed

CHUCKIE
Listen up skippy SHE THE ONLY
WITNESS
Scene 78Page 43
HUEY

But if we hit the road now well be
five hundred miles away before they

Atlanticjust like you promised

Huey stares off into space like hes having a vision

CHUCKIE
We gotta take care of her When she

Well head off then Huey just

Huey shakes his head in disbelief

HUEY
We aint gonna make it are we
Chuckie I aint never gonna see

Chuckie Just say it

Chuckie is taken aback by what Huey is saying He walks away
turns his concentration back to the flashlight Huey calls
after him

HUEY (CONTD)
She was just some stupid housewife
mouthin off

CHUCKIE
GET REAL Huey And shut the fuck up
about the stupid ocean

Chuckie gets right up in Hueys face
CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I ever break a promise to you I

Huey takes his time to answer

HUEY
No Chuckie you aint

Chuckie puts his hand on Hueys shoulder and gently pushes him
along the road

EXT EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

Della tries once more to lift the hood It still wont budge

Scene 79Page 44

When she looks up the flashlight is dancing towards her
Vinh sees the car

VINH (0S)
Theres her Ford

Della grabs the lug wrench and toolbox and ducks behind the
trees

Della sees them approach her car

VINH (CONTD)
Theres broken glass everywhere

Huey now resigned to their mission comments sadly

HUEY
Someone call her mama tell her to
lay out her black dress

Della creeps softly along the edge of the trees She holds
her breath If she makes a sound shes dead

TOMAS
Is she dead already

The boys kick around the Explorer

VINH
Musta gone been thrown through the
windshield

Della skims the trees constantly checking behind her to
where her antagonists check out the Ford wreck

Chuckie points to some footprints
CHUCKIE
She aint dead Look Her
footprints are all around
When theres enough distance between them and her she darts

from the forests edge into the development and hides behind
a half finished house

EXT UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING
She leans against a recently bricked wall finally takes a
breath The smell of fresh cement and putty fills her

nostrils

Scene 80Page 45

Rain gathers and drips from a nearby ledge
She peers around the side of the house

EXT EDGE OF WOODSCONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING

Beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs she
sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her Ford
illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their flashlight

Her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and
structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall

When she looks back over for the boys she sees that the
flashlight and the boys are gone

She strains her eyes Guesses that must mean theyre off
looking for her in another direction

She clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the
houses

If she could just track along the edge of the development she
could maybe make it back to the Shopping Mall to the twins

An owl hoots from the trees behind She freezes eyes
sweeping the immediate area for danger

She waits a moment silence then makes her way once more
between the edge of the development and the edge of the
trees

Shes trying desperately not to make a sound praying to be
invisible eyes darting around evaluating every shape and
form

On one side the dense wood of trees predominantly pine with
thick ancient trunks and tangled branches On the other

plots and structures of homes to be

She keeps trudging on skirting the edge of the trees
following the lights in the distance

She hears a loud thudding noise Stops Stops breathing

EXT PLANKS IN TARP - EVENING

Ahead piles of planks wrapped in black tarp block her view

She braces herself peers cautiously around sees nothing
She clutches the lug wrench and toolbox and steps forwards

Scene 82Page 46
Rain water from the branches of a nearby tree is dripping
down and collecting in a puddle in the middle of the tarp

causing the sound

She breathes a sigh of relief

EXT CEMENT PILES - EVENING
Heaps of damp shingle and cement cause her to back up and

around past them and a cement mixer She loses sight of the
neon mall lights She panics

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING
She runs between the foundations of two houses

She stops suddenly when she sees a giant shadow looming
across her path

She ducks down the side of a half finished house
Sees that it is the shadow of an earth moving truck

She keeps going between the houses looking for a sign of
the mall lights

She stops

Just ahead a flurry of footprints

Theyre her footprints

EXT UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING

She finds herself back where she started at the same house

The mall lights flicker in the distance as far away as they
always were The Fords still there ahead

And then she sees the flashlight sweeping towards her

DELLA
(under her breath)
NO OH NO

She bites back a sob

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING
Della shrinks backwards between the houses She ducks into
an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead
Scene 86Page 47
She runs into the house and out through the far side Skirts
a row of plots of land Then she hears Chuckies mocking
voice echoing through the building site
CHUCKIE (0S)
DELLA
Della recoils Did she just hallucinate
How the hell do they know her name
Can they see her Or is he just shouting her name randomly
into the night
Her eyes dart right then left then back again Nothing
She runs down a row of house foundations
CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Della

INT UNFINISHED HOUSE 2 - EVENING

Della dives into an unfinished house hides behind a space
where a window will eventually be looks out across the
building site All is dark outside And then she sees the
light several rows down weaving between the houses

She makes for another window at the opposite end of the
house She sees the mall lights and decides to head once more
towards them

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE -EVENING

She creeps out of the house and crosses several rows of
houses then several more heading towards the neon lights in
the distance

EXT FENCE -EVENING

She stops dead in her tracks Straight ahead a truly
chilling sight - her kids stuff from the car Terris little
anorak Tammis socks mittens strung along a short stretch
of wire fence

Her feet start to sink into wet mud She covers her mouth to
stop herself crying out

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE -EVENING
Suddenly the development is illuminated by a huge
construction light

Scene 91Page 48

EXT MUD -EVENING
Della ducks down tries to run The mud cloys at her feet

EXT PLANK BETWEEN TWO HOUSES -EVENING

She steps up onto a plank that stretches between the first
floors of two houses She starts to cross when she sees their
silhouettes

EXTINT UNFINISHED HOUSE 3 -EVENING

Theyre searching the house next door

TOMAS
Whered little red riding hood git

HUEY
When a nigga hungry Imma wolf

EXT PLANK BETWEEN TWO HOUSES - EVENING
She backs up slips slides off the plank falls into the
mud catches herself on some barbed wire
CHUCKIE (0S)
What was that
The wire drives through her coat and into her right shoulder
She jerks away but the length of loose barbed wire follows
She bites her lip to prevent a pained response
Shes caught in its spiral like a trapped animal She spins
around and physically pulls the wire from her back tearing
her coat
She casts the wire away from her Winces

INT UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 (FOUNDATION) -EVENING

She crawls into the foundations of a nearby house underneath
the floorboards which are lain roughly across to form a first
floor She huddles in a dark corner Its very quiet and
cramped She tries not to move not to breathe The smell of
the wet earth underneath makes her feel nauseous A moment
passes It feels like an infinity

Scene 95Page 49

She starts to creep along towards a gap in the planks to see
if she can see anything above Just as she approaches the gap
she hears

The sound of footsteps above her
She freezes
The footsteps make erratic rhythms across the planks

She silently undoes the catch of the toolbox Her hands are
shaking She lifts the lid She rakes around inside for
tools comes across several kids toys instead In shock she
rakes around some more trying to find something else
something more dangerous anything To her surprise the only
tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small
crescent wrench The kids must have borrowed the other tools

replacing them with the toys She gives up closes over the
lid

Then suddenly
BOOM

INT UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 -EVENING

The whole house is illuminated She looks up to see four
faces looking down at her Chuckie points the gaze of a
powerful flashlight directly into her eyes

The beam almost blinds her She tries to look away but
Chuckie focuses it right in her eyes

CHUCKIE
Peek a boo

She shrinks back towards the wall Her mouth feels dry so
dry Tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so
they can see her Shes cornered

Chuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it
voyeuristically down across her body

The light lingers on her breasts Huey whistles
appreciatively picks the game back up from the parking lot

HUEY
Yo left without yo goodbye kiss

The light sweeps past Hueys hips The sound of a zipper The
light sweeps back up onto Della

Scene 96Page 50

CHUCKIE
You a window shopper little
brother You aint never even done
the old in and out before

Waves of pain spasm through Dellas shoulder
The boys snigger
HUEY

Imma just a young playa tryin to
put my bid in
Tomas leans down towards Della Chuckie moves the flashlight
to illuminate them both Tomas drains the last dregs from a
bottle of Bud tosses the empty bottle down into the
foundations It rolls into the darkness

Della shudders She clutches the lug wrench against her coat
behind the tool box and tries to disappear into the wall

TOMAS
Dont worry when we done wit you
we send yo back in yo trunk to Mr
Podunk

Tomas reaches down and pulls Della up to standing by the coat
collar He then yanks the coat down over her shoulder The
white shirt she wears underneath is damp with sweat making
the form of her breasts very clear

Chuckie keeps the light focused right on her

Tomas slides his index finger down across Dellas neck
towards her breasts

Della claws at Tomas face with the nails of her free hand
He staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing Her
chewed nails havent left any dents but she stunned him

The others laugh
She shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it
tight across herself once again clasping the toolbox close

to her side

TOMAS (CONTD)
Dont want to play nice Puta

He moves towards her face twisted with hate arm raised

Scene 96Page 51

CHUCKIE
Back off five minutes my Ghetto
brother

Tomas glares at Della then lowers his arm Spits on the
ground instead Turns back to the boys Chuckie moves

forwards and focuses on Dellas box

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Whats with the man size crast
Della doesnt answer

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You running with the family jewels

Della still doesnt answer

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You rob a bank this morning Della

Della remains determinedly mute

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Least yo learned something tonight
Della honey

VINH
Yeah like how to quit mouthing if
you wanna avoid drama

CHUCKIE
You must be wondering how we come
to know your name

Chuckie giggles Della shivers

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You screwed up Della Myers Left
your purse in the Ford

Chuckie holds up her driving licence and examines it

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
What a shitty photo

Chuckie nods to Vinh Vinh passes his lighter to Chuckie
Chuckie lights the licence on fire The plastic burns black
and toxic The flame annihilates Dellas name her date of
birth her face Pieces of plastic unfurl and drift up
through the empty windows and doors of the unfinished house

Scene 96Page 52

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Guess you wont be needing it no
more

Della stares defiantly fighting back the internal nausea
caused by this symbolically brutal act

Chuckie maneuvers the light back in her eyes then right back
on his own menacing face Then back again on her face She
becomes disoriented

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
So whats in the box

Della remains mute looks away from the beam

HUEY
Yo think she carrying the big
notes maybe some ice

CHUCKIE
Nah it aint about to rain
diamonds Huey But maybe she
cashed in her life savings Planned
to take off start a new life

Della tries to swallow but her throat is too dry

She knows
knowledge

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
That right Della

TOMAS
You got enough scratch in there to
grease us up with

there is nothing that would buy them off and the
sinks like a stone deep into her gut

Chuckie follows her face with the beam She tries to dodge

its glare

in her eyes But he maneuvers it like a

surveillance camera

His voice
tingle

takes on a meanness that makes the back of her neck

CHUCKIE
Open it

They crowd closer toward her

Dark forms with eyes glinting Their voices echoing

Scene 96Page 53

VINH
Open the box else we put you in

trauma
CHUCKIE
OPEN IT
Della all but screams
DELLA

Okay
Ill open it

Dellas brain races
Her hands move slowly

She rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of
the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch

She holds the far end of the lid up to shield her right hand
from the beam as she slips it inside the box

A prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel
the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench

She curls them around its handle and grips tight A surge of
nervous energy courses through her veins

TOMAS
She aint got nuthin Lets just
take that pussy and git going

He moves towards her

In a flash she withdraws the crescent wrench She cocks her
wrist back and hurls the tool snaps it just like her daddy
taught her to play baseball

The wrench flies up and across the house

With a CRUNCH it catches Chuckie right in the collar bone
right side

He screams Drops the flashlight Drops to his knees holding
his throat

Della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it She
throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between

Tomas and Huey

Scene 96Page 54
Huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank lands with
his face down biting on the planks edge

Della catches a peripheral glimpse of Tomas leaping towards
her but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of
Hueys neck Grinds Hueys face into the plank with a hideous
THUD Hueys neck SNAPS back smiley style Hueys scream
gurgles into the night Hueys body falls through the space
in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations
below

Tomas falls away cursing in horror

TOMAS (CONTD)
Maricon

Della makes a run for the doorway She jumps down onto the
muddy lot and heads off across the development The darkness
quickly swallows her

Behind her Vinh slumps through the house

VINH
What the fuck niggaz

CHUCKIE
Shut up
VINH
You hurt
CHUCKIE

SHUT THE FUCK UP
Chuckie slides down to be beside Huey in the foundations

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
And dont be using the N word You
aint representing GOT IT That
right Huey HUEY Get up Huey HUEY
GET UP

Tomas staggers up to standing

TOMAS
Jesus hijo de maria el virgene

VINH
What

Vinh moves towards Chuckie who is crouched over Huey

Scene 96Page 55

CHUCKIE
My little brother

Tomas approaches
He pushes Chuckie gently out of the way so he can see

He stares down at Hueys bloody meshed face Tomas staggers
backwards and crosses himself

TOMAS
Mamacita Madre de Dios

Chuckie punches Tomas leg

CHUCKIE
You tread on my boys face YOU
KILLED HIM

TOMAS
I didnt kill him I didnt kill no

one
Tomas pushes Chuckie backwards

TOMAS (CONTD)
She did it She killed him

Chuckie and Tomas stare at each other

TOMAS (CONTD)
Im gonna cross that bitch out

EXT WOODS - EVENING

Della runs for her life She makes straight for the cover of
the trees She hesitates for just a moment after the first
layer of Pines Its pitch black beyond Then she steps in
She follows her breath into the icy blackness

Branches and foliage scratch against her face

She grapples about looking for hiding places between the
dark shapes and forms Steps between tree roots and shrubs
Her eyes begin to adjust She can now make out the
difference between the clumps of darkness and tell looking
back where the edge of the woods begins A construction
light shines behind like a distant moon

Scene 97Page 56

She pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees
some thick and knotted others slight and brittle Only the
evergreens still have their foliage

Looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign
of the boys

Fear drives her further into the woods towards where the
trees grow even more densely together Where there just may
be the right place to hide

She stops for a second to catch her breath

The handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm She
changes hands

God that boy Huey He really died back there She heard the
sound of it The horrific sound of him dying a stupid
pointless death

It could have been her

There has to be some way out of this nightmare

Ahead a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path
She steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots

CHUCKIE
DELLA

Chuckies voice drifts towards her She ducks down among the
roots

Her eyes scan the darkness

No moving shapes nor forms No sound No flashlight Just
shadowy clumps of trees

Should she stay put or should she run

Then she sees it The flashlight weaving through the pines
ahead

She pushes further in among the roots tries to make herself
invisible

The flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards
her One set of footsteps crunches through the foilage

She holds still terrified
The flashlight pauses on the dead tree the roots

Scene 97Page 57

Della stops breathing
Then the light sweeps past and on into the woods

She waits until it disappears before stepping out of her
hiding place

She creeps back in the opposite direction figuring if
theyre in the woods now she should get out

Her eyes search for the construction light which indicates
the edge of the wood

She heads in the direction of the light painfully aware that
one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers She steps
between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer
The construction light grows closer

The light abruptly goes out

She stops eyes desperately searching the trees

She resumes in the direction she was headed Tries to keep
calm

But the woods are impenetrable Layers of trees and shrubs
and then more trees Deep in the cold dark places there are
patches of left over snow Shes losing her bearings

EXT XD TREES - EVENING

Ahead the chilling sight of four luminous Xs glowing in the
dark forest almost makes her heart stop She realizes the
crosses are painted on the trunks of several trees marking
them for death She shivers

EXT WOODS -EVENING

She backs up starts off in the opposite direction

And there it is again The flashlight sweeping through the
trees in the distance

She stops close to screaming then when the flashlight
disappears runs off in yet another direction

She slows to take a breath notices the butts of several
cigarettes still smoking in the dirt close to her feet

Scene 99Page 58

DELLA
(muttering to herself)
Shit Oh Shit

She trudges on pushing between the branches no clue where
she is headed

The further she treads the quieter it becomes So quiet she
can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees

breathing

Then she spots the light again in the distance shining out
over the forest

Thank God

She trudges up a slope ahead clinging onto branches and
shrubs to help pull herself up

EXT LEDGE - EVENING
The light grows closer She climbs up onto a ledge
A loud noise startles her Its music Rap music Blasting
Della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees
Sees

EXT CLEARING - EVENING

The woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing where a huge
ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees Young pines
about to become Christmas trees Its blasting out a hip hop
anthem for a dead homie A construction light illuminates the
clearing

A ghostly Vinh head hung low moves to the music bottle of
beer in hand

Propped up against a tree stump sits the body of Huey arms
crossed over his torso hood pulled up to cover his face

The scene is so surreal that Della is drawn closer She
creeps along the edge of the trees

As she moves she kicks back on some dirt It tumbles
downhill into the gulch She freezes

But nobody notices

She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas
enters the clearing

Scene 101Page 59

Tomas stops and watches Vinh

Vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn Japanese
punk style The juxtaposition between the hard core rap music
and the serious vibe that Vinh is sending out shows us that
this is really important music to him

Its a theatrical tableau -

Della overhead looking down on the clearing

Vinh transfixed by the music

Tomas stone silent watching Vinh

It plays out for a poignant moment Like theyre all part of
some spiritual rite about to be consummated

Vinh pours some beer onto the ground at Hueys feet A small
tear runs down his stoic face

Then CLICK The blaster is abruptly turned off by Chuckie who
appears out of the shadows behind it

He stares a beat at Vinh like he cant believe what hes been
seeing
Vinh keeps on moving like hes in a trance

CHUCKIE
What the fuck you doing

Vinh doesnt reply Stares down at the ground keeps on with
his weird dance Chuckie moves towards him Tomas grabs
Chuckie tries to stop him from going for Vinh but Chuckie
shrugs him off

Chuckie reaches out and shakes Vinh No response He shakes
him again

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I asked you what your deal is sand
dancer

The second shake sort of breaks Vinh out of his trance He
shivers

VINH
Its a tribute A gesture

CHUCKIE
A what

Scene 101Page 60

Vinh stares down at the dirt at his feet

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Your brain even smaller than em
slits for eyes

Vinh slouches defiantly over to the blaster and presses track
8 replay

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
eep on banging out that ghetto ass
shit and youll alert every cop in
Podunk county

VINH
ts for Huey Our dead homie

The song starts again Chuckie looks at him incredulously
shouts above the music

CHUCKIE
You checked out right

VINH
He loved that track

Vinh snorts back a sob He hugs himself into a hunch and
starts dancing again

Chuckie loses it He slaps Vinh

CHUCKIE
Get a grip skippy

Vinh rubs his face Hes getting a grip all right Chuckie
slams off the blaster

CHUCKIE (CONTD)

Hueys DEAD And aint no requiem
gonna resurrect his ass He down
under the ground now with the real
men of respect

The three boys stand somberly in silence each paying
internal homage to their dead friend Chuckie hardens his
heart against the tears that threaten to flow Tomas
trembles mumbles

TOMAS
I didnt mean it I didnt do it I
didnt mean to kill him

Scene 101Page 61

This breaks the moment Chuckie snaps back

CHUCKIE
Well he dead Thats it for him
OVER But we still here Hell
yeah Paybacks gonna be a real
bitch for a real bitch

Vinh wipes away his tears

VINH
She probably gone by now

CHUCKIE
You best hope not genius She
gone we gone

Chuckie paces around the circumference of the clearing

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
DELLA

EXT LEDGE - EVENING

Dellas been watching the scene unfold a captive audience
attentive and terrified

Slowly she tears her eyes away from the boys She backs away
from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old
tree The branch digs into that point in her shoulder she
hurt earlier on the barbed wire

She reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody She
reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue Nothing Feels
something in her pants pocket

She pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper

She unfolds it Its Tammis drawing The one from the
beginning

The stick figure family holding hands and Mommy - We love
you written in stars

Dellas lost in the drawing Her eyes drink in every mark and
color and word She sees that the male figure is slightly
separate That the children stick figures have frightened
eyes and cling to the female That the sky is turbulent The
stars clear and bright The words

A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid Then another A
sob

Scene 102Page 62

She might never see her kids again
Another sob She heaves with the release of emotion

More tears escape Another sob She tries to bite it back
Wills herself to stop

Finds that rage takes sorrows place Rage and self
recrimination

Goddamit Shes gonna be raped and killed because of some
stupid note And God knows what will become of the kids

Kenneth always told her she had a temper That she reacts
without thinking of the consequences This time the bastard
was right

She looks again at the picture
Chuckies voice booms out into the night

CHUCKIE (0S)
D-E-L-L-A H-O-N-E-Y

She folds the picture up carefully and puts it back in her
pocket

Della edges further into the trees and disappears into the
darkness

Theres rustling in the darkness Tomas pushes through the
edge of the trees making animal calls with his right hand
curled around his mouth The flashlight illuminates him from
behind

Chuckie follows him operating the light in a mockery of
classic noir style Vinh slouches behind them

Tomas heads along the ledge straight past the spot where
Della stood only moments before Tomas doubles back

Thomas stops sniffs

TOMAS
I can smell her Bulgari

Chuckies behind him surveying the area with the flashlight
He finds several footprints by the tree

CHUCKIE
She was right here Must a saw your
dumb ass tribute and everything

Scene 102Page 63

Vinh glares at Chuckie Chuckie grins at Tomas

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Bulgari She looks more like she
rocks that number five shit

TOMAS
It Bulgari dude My Dads bitch
bathes in it

Chuckie points the flashlight towards where the ledge ends
and a steep incline begins

EXT STEEP INCLINE - EVENING

The flashlight illuminates a set of prints descending down
the incline

CHUCKIE
There more of her footprints

Tomas and Vinh just stand like zombies
Chuckie pushes Vinh

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
What you waiting on Jackie Chan

Vinh plods clumsily down the incline followed by Tomas

Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a
sign of Della

Chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope As
the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of
Della between some rocks at the far side But the boys eyes
are elsewhere focused on the steep incline ahead of them

Della quickly ducks draws her toolbox in tight and crouches
low between the rocks She watches the boys carefully as they
climb down the gulch

Theres the sound of a stumble followed by a splash

VINH (0S)
SHIT

TOMAS (0S)
What now cabron

VINH (0S)
Fell in a frozen ass stream

Scene 103Page 64
Chuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them Della sees Vinh
trudging out of the stream Tomas descending the last few
feet of the other side of the gulch and Chuckie midway up

Vinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his
sneakers

CHUCKIE
Zipperhead

VINH
Konaro Kusotare

CHUCKIE
You know we dont speak the Chinky

VINH
Whats your game Chuckie We left
stumbling around in the dark while
you hog the flashlight

CHUCKIE
I stole it I get to use it Thats
how it works That right Tomas

TOMAS
Right on dog

Chuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins Vinh and
Tomas at the edge of the stream

VINH
What if I steal it from you

CHUCKIE
There you go bro

He hands the flashlight over to Vinh Vinh reaches for it
Chuckie pulls it away

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
April Fool Naw wait a minute it
aint April Must be Christmas
fool

Tomas smirks Vinh hangs his head down They search for more
prints cant find any in the immediate area Chuckie shines
the flashlight at the foot of a big rock

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Her footprints disappear at the big
rock
Scene 103Page 65

A beat Della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand
Vinh shivers violently

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Head on up and search the slope
Ill guide your way with the
flashlight

Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch Della ducks
Della needs to get out of there and fast

They begin to ascend the rocks Chuckie keeps the flashlight
slightly ahead of them

Della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks keeping
as low as she can Dodging the approaching light

The boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the
dexterity of animals Dellas so low shes scraping her knees
and hands to shreds

She can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin
What was she thinking hiding here It was too exposed

TOMAS
We gonna put yo ass on ice bitch

God please help her make it back into the cover of the trees
Della almost vomits

Her hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch She
pushes the toolbox up on the ledge Her strength is ebbing
but she tries to hoist herself up The flashlight sweeps by
She lets go of the ledge and ducks The flashlight sweeps by
again

She huddles in behind a rock Waits a beat

TOMAS (CONTD)
You going home in a casket tonight

Oh shit theyre approaching fast She tries again to hoist
herself up Shes almost up when the flashlight sweeps by
again
This time it catches her

CHUCKIE
THERE SHE IS TOP OF THE GULCH

Scene 103Page 66

She practically throws herself over the ledge Tomas scurries
to the top faster than lightening catches her leg as she
crawls from the edge

THUD She kicks him in the face
Della grabs the toolbox Makes a run for it

TOMAS
AHHHHHEEEEEEHHHHH

Tomas falls back from the gulch-side loosening several
rocks The rocks tumble downhill hit Vinh

VINH
AHHHHHHH

Chuckie scales the gulch behind them Vinh rubs his head
Sees something between the trees Thinks its Huey

VINH (CONTD)
Huey

He starts towards the brush

VINH (CONTD)
Is that you homie

Chuckie catches up with Vinh breathless from climbing fast
Vinh points into the brush

VINH (CONTD)
I saw Huey there in the brush

CHUCKIE
What

Chuckie looks around hoping against hope that Vinh may be
right that Huey may just be alive Vinh becomes perplexed

VINH
I saw him

CHUCKIE
Sure you did bro

Chuckie puts his arm around Vinh and helps him up the rock
side Vinh is shivering so hard hes almost sobbing

Just ahead Tomas pulls himself up and over the ledge

Scene 104Page 67

EXT WOODS - EVENING

Tomas catches up with Della chases her into the trees
Behind him Vinh hoists himself up over the ledge then
Chuckie

Della runs Faster than shes ever run before Practically
flies through the trees

Her breath comes hard His too just behind her Their
footfalls crash into the foliage

Its dark so dark Shes running blindly

And theyre right behind her Tomas swipes at her He just
misses He swipes again

A twisted shape looms ahead almost blocks her path

She runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment
setting up Thomas whos right behind her

Tomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk hits
himself at groin level He doubles over in pain

TOMAS
CONEJO AINT NUTHIN CAN SAVE YO
ASS NOW
Della races on
Thomas gathers himself together picks up the chase

But that moments delay has bought her some time

Her adrenaline pumps hard Eyes darting for a hiding place
among the dark shapes and planes of the woods
105 105
EXT DEADWOOD PILE - EVENING

There it is a deadwood pile
She throws herself down into its midst The dried branches
jag and tear at her hands and face She burrows down low so

low shes right in the dirt She peers between the branches

Tomass feet run by and disappear She hears him circle the
area then turn back towards her

A moment passes She picks the next Rises slowly and softly
from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench

Scene 105Page 68

And then there he is Diving out of the trees towards her
Della raises the lug wrench

In the clouded moonlight its an almost biblical image a
woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross

Tomas crashes towards her

Della swings the lug wrench hard intensely directly at
Tomass face

There is a THUD as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches
him up under the chin It sends him reeling

He goes down face first
Della gasps in horror watches as

Tomas pulls himself up onto his feet comes towards her once
more

Della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the
head

He spins clutches at his head then reaches towards her
AGAIN

She loses it She swings the lug wrench towards him All the
years of pent up rage finally find their release

The wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening CRUNCH
It drives the cartilage up and into his face
Blood spurts from the wound He staggers backwards
A shocked scream escapes from Dellas mouth

DELLA
Awwwrgh

As she staggers backwards in the opposite direction
Tomas tries to cry out but can only utter in pain

TOMAS
Unnh Unnh Unnh

He tries to pull the lug wrench out of his face Spins
Stumbles

The flashlight beam travels past them

Scene 105Page 69

TOMAS (CONTD)
Unnh

Tomas crashes back into a tree He loses consciousness His
body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt Blood
gushes from where the wrench meets his face He looks like
hes dressed for Halloween

Della just stares Stares at Tomas at what she did what she
had to do

Tomas eyes are wide open staring too at nothing dead

The horror of having killed someone overwhelms Della She
starts shaking with shock

Vinh cries out for Tomas

VINH (0S)
TOMAS

The sound of footfalls crashing through the brush follows
CHUCKIE (0S)
Curb the squealing You a gangsta

or a boy scout

Vinhs voice is breathless and jittery
VINH (0S)
Tomass gone Chuckie I can feel
it

Della tears herself away from Tomass body and staggers into
the deadwood to collect the toolbox It glints even in the
darkness

She grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree

Behind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the
flashlight illuminates Vinh and Chuckie as they march through
the woods searching for Tomas

CHUCKIE
Tomas is one hard son of a bitch
He got her strung up from a tree by
now and you know it

But Chuckie doesnt look so sure Vinh charges ahead into the
darkness

Scene 105Page 70

Della flashes briefly into shot running between the trees
The flashlight sweeps by

VINH
Theres something over here

Chuckie walks towards Vinh Vinh takes the flashlight from
Chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three
trees

VINH (CONTD)
It looks like a body

They close in on a muddle of shapes bush and spidery tree
trunks The flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and
thick as a body

CHUCKIE
Its a big old tree trunk you
paranoid gook

Chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from Vinh but Vinh
wont give it Chuckie doesnt persist Vinh keeps going
shivering and blustering
Vinh senses something He shines the flashlight behind the
tree trunk Still nothing Sweeps back

Della darts between the evergreens behind them She conceals
herself in between the trunks and branches Braces herself
waits for the right moments the ones when theyre not
looking to run between the trees Cognizant enough to know
they just want to find Tomas right now She seems to be on
autopilot becoming numb as the minutes stretch on

She watches Vinh plod forward and through the brush He hits
every inch of it with the flashlight Sighs Doubles back to
follow Chuckie

Then the flashlight catches a glimpse of something Sweeps
back illuminates Tomass dead body splayed out on the mud
at the foot of the tree eyes staring wide bloody ghastly

Tomass Catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight

Silence until Vinh falls to his knees in front of Tomas
tries to speak but only a whisper comes out

VINH
Tomas TYAH

Scene 105Page 71

Chuckie realizes from Vinhs demeanor that something really
is wrong He hesitates a moment then rushes over to Vinh
stares too at Tomass body gulps back the desire to scream

He punches his fist hard into the tree behind Tomas body
instead A shower of pine needles rains down on them

Chuckie grabs the flashlight and sweeps it away from the
body grabs Vinhs arm grounding him

Vinh sobs and shakes

VINH (CONTD)
She gonna kill you and me next
Were all gonna die here God knows
what other tools she got in that
box

CHUCKIE
It was a stupid ass accident killed
Huey You know that And Tomas
Chuckie chokes up despite himself

He stands up brushes the pine needles off his tee shirt
He paces back and forth

He pulls the gun out from deep in his jeans

Della creeps between the trees behind them She appears for a
second or two like a ghost behind the next tree

Chuckie defiantly fights back tears

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I promise you this

He kisses the gun
CHUCKIE (CONTD)
This babys gonna cancel her

Christmas

Della darts between the trees faster now Their voices
follow her

VINH (0S)
Aint no gun can kill a ghost gone

bad

Scene 105Page 72

She staggers deeper and deeper into the forest into the
darkness

CHUCKIE (0S)
You in America now dude where the
ghosts bleed
She hears a faint gurgle
She slows listens Its the burble of a stream
She listens hard Traces the sound Treads towards it

There it is Glistening even in the dark

106 106
EXT STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING

She steps between rocks walks straight into the stream
below

She stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed
clutching the toolbox

The water gurgles faintly below her so cold it almost sounds
like glass breaking

The ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her
eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered
for all time

Shes talking to herself in a whisper

DELLA
Im sorry

All she knows is that she just killed a boy It may have been
in self defense but she killed him

DELLA (CONTD)
Im so sorry

The grief overcomes her silently Her face crumples Her
stomach muscles spasm and wrack through her body A grief so
deep tears would be a relief

DELLA (CONTD)
Where are you God

She falls to her knees in the stream Holding herself and
rocking The freezing water seeps up into her clothes her
hair

Scene 106Page 73

DELLA (CONTD)
Please I just want to see my
babies again

Her rocking slows until it stops Theres a loud crunch close
by She rises reflexively from the stream Raises the
toolbox She looks around A branch has broken from a tree
and drags down into the stream behind her

This seems to bring her back to herself She realizes its
only a matter of time before they come looking for her She

needs to get moving

She sets off downstream She trudges through the shallow
water Her wet coat drags heavily

The stream must end somewhere likely at the other edge of
the woods

She trudges onwards sweeping aside the branches of stooping
trees stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream

Forging ahead
She now needs to pee GREAT Her temper surges up

She looks for the right place to do it realizes its
probably best to pee in the stream so all trace of it will
be dispersed

A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the
stream She makes her way toward it

She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the
branches We see glimpses of her lifting her coat pulling
down her pants pushing the crotch of her underpants to the
side We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water
meeting the stream

More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants
smoothing down her coat

She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up
the toolbox

She plows down stream once more Longing to see the light
that will tell her shes at the edge of the woods closer to
the mall lights closer to home

She swallows another wave of grief

Scene 106Page 74

The stream loops around ahead then splits into two She
follows it picks the left fork

And then she hears it the terrible sound of feet thundering
down into the stream behind her

She doesnt even turn to see them Just runs Runs for her
life

The glare of the flashlight blasts against her back Freezing
water splashes up her legs soaking through her pants Her

feet slip and slide over wet rocks But she keeps running

Vinhs behind her She can feel his breath the swipe of his
hands as he grabs for her and misses She runs even faster

She leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream They leap
behind her

She pushes through the hanging branches of several trees
Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes
right into Vinhs face

He tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes He cries
out covers his eyes

VINH
Aaaarrhh

This buys her a moment or two to get ahead The stream bends
right ahead She opts to stay in it Chuckie leaps out runs
along the banks hoping to outrun and trap her

But the stream then bends left giving her an advantage He
leaps back across the stream to the other side But shes
outrunning him He charges back into the stream behind her

Della keeps on running through the stream somehow trusting
its direction

Vinh catches up with Chuckie The boys are maybe twenty-five
feet behind her

A SHOT rings out Then a bullet races past her ear Lodges in
a tree just ahead of her She almost loses her footing Shed
forgotten for just a moment that they had a gun

Another shot blasts off into the night skims her shoulder
hits the muddy bank of the stream She flinches braces
herself keeps going adrenalin pumping harder than ever

Scene 106Page 75

The stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead For just a
moment shes invisible to them She uses it When she reaches
the rocks she dives out ducking below the glare of
Chuckies flashlight down behind the rocks

EXT EMBANKMENT - EVENING

She creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows
of some wiry shrubs as close to the mud as her back will
allow

The boys stop by the rocks Chuckie sweeps the flashlight up
the muddy embankment looking for a footprint a sign of her

She tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid
leaving prints Tries to stay quiet as a mouse Stops when
she sees the flashlight sweep by

If she can get to the top she can make another run for it

All of a sudden it grows dark The boys must have switched
the flashlight off or maybe the batterys dead She listens
hard for their footfalls Nothing

EXT PINE TREE - EVENING

She sees that she is in the shadows of a big old Pine tree

She creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently
slides open the toolbox fumbles around for the screwdriver
She removes it from the box and grasps it tight

Della rises slowly remaining concealed behind the tree She
reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction
of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk She pulls
herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk
She peeks between the branches

No sign of the boys She pulls herself further up into the
tree branch by branch

The thin stiff outer branches fringed with sharp little
needles fall like a jagged veil around her

She waits

Shes high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape
below despite the darkness

She makes out the faint echo of voices strains to hear

Scene 109Page 76

EXT STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING
Vinh and Chuckie are arguing in whispers Vinhs pale and
shivering hard

VINH
I dont feel good Chuckie You
think I got the hypothermia

CHUCKIE
Nah yo got the yellow fever

Vinh sulks

VINH
Im telling you it aint natural
how she gets away every time

Chuckie clicks the flashlight back on Sweeps it up across
and back down the embankment to the stream illuminating the
banks

CHUCKIE
She got to be hiding up on the
slope You head up first and Ill
follow with the flashlight

The light sweeps past her Della shrinks further into the
branches of the tree She crunches her foot against a branch
SHIT

The boys freeze then resume talking in whispers

VINH
I aint going up there without the
gun End of story

CHUCKIE
Never wouldve pegged you as a
pussy Vinh Even when Huey and
Tomas called it I always defended

your ass
VINH
Aint no one never said I was a
pussy
CHUCKIE

She a skinny ass bitch too Cant
be weighing in at more than one
twenty

Scene 109Page 77

VINH
Tomas an Huey never called me a
pussy

CHUCKIE
I aint speaking ill o the dead

VINH
You already did

Vinhs shivering so hard his teeth are knocking

CHUCKIE
Anyways when you ever shot a gun
Probably miss and shoot yourself in
the foot

Vinh paces braces himself to head up after Della

EXT EMBANKMENT - EVENING

Vinh starts to ascend the embankment
CHUCKIE
Thats the spirit gangsta Holler
if you see her and Ill shoot

Vinh glares back at Chuckie

VINH
Faito

Della watches Vinh plough through the brush

The flashlight sweeps and darts with his movements up ahead
of him up the embankment

Vinh pushes through several trees slips regains his
footing He plods past the tree She slips the screwdriver up
her sleeve Prays he wont stop

She pulls herself further up the tree

A sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her followed
by a shower of pine needles

Her heart stops
A moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by
the squawking of angry birds

Shes disturbed a birds nest

Scene 110Page 78

She sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst
through the branches above and up into the patch of sky
between

The crows circle the patch of sky above like a Greek chorus

She looks back down for a sign of Vingh Sees nothing Inches
along a branch to see better

The light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye
line disorienting her

She hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree
Her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him Vinh
standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her

She stares down at him frozen holding her breath

The flashlight illuminates the whole tree then sweeps away
up the embankment

But Vinhs seen something He makes out her footprints under
the tree He leans down to check then rises looks up

through the branches

Their eyes meet He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie

She LEAPS down through the branches Lands THUD on his back

VINH (CONTD)
CHUUUCCKKKKIEEE

She silences his yell with a choke hold Wraps her legs
around his torso He bites her arm but she holds tight

CHUCKIE (0S)
Vinh

Panic has crept into Chuckies voice

CHUCKIE (0S) (CONTD)
VINH
Vinh topples to the mud dragging Della with him

They roll as he desperately tries to disengage her

The flashlight frantically searches the area for them

Della frees the screwdriver shed stuffed up her sleeve

She DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinhs skull

Scene 110Page 79

Vinh screams
She thrusts and twists the tool

All the while shes tightly wound around him intertwined
intimate as a lover

She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her
knuckles dig into his stiff hair

Vinhs scream becomes a high keening wail

The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinhs skull It
protrudes through his mouth knocking several teeth out ina
stream of blood

His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins

They roll downstream

His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her

They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds
of the way down

She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers He
becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies
right there on top of her

Shes trapped suffocating underneath him until she finds
the strength to push him off

She crawls out from under his body
Pushing him away sets him off rolling again

She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady Her head
hurts so bad its about to burst
The world around her shifts into a migraine zone Trails
follow trees rocks brush The desire to close her eyes to
close it all out almost overwhelms her

Her shoulder aches too and theres a new pain in her arm
where Vinh bit her She sees blood has matted her sleeve and
rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark

Theres a loud crash Della freezes and moves only her eyes
looks around

Its Vinhs body hitting the stream below

Scene 110Page 80

Where was the light at the edge of the woods Nowhere to be
seen now thats for sure

She staggers along the slope clutching onto tree trunks and
roots as she goes

Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy
slope Pulls it clean out by the roots Loses her footing
reaches for the roots of an old tree She pulls herself up

Plods once more along the slope heading upwards in a
diagonal through the darkness

She arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more
darkness But theres a strange calm about her now Like
shes reached the eye of a terrible storm

CHUCKIE (0S) (CONTD)
Della

When she hears his voice drifting faintly towards her she
almost smiles

She knows hes coming for her and theres nothing she can do
about it

Della shivers as she sees a surreal tableau ahead four huge
felled trees wrapped in white plastic Their sad stumps are
only feet away Its the funeral parlour of the forest

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Delllaaa

EXT FELLED TREES WRAPPED IN PLASTIC - EVENING

Della sinks down behind the large trunk of a plastic wrapped
tree She listens hard tries to fathom which direction hes
coming from

His voice drifts in and out of proximity like hes pacing
around in circles His voice has changed - hes dropped the
gangster schtick

CHUCKIE
Theres only you and me now

Maybe if he wanders into the right position she can sneak
up on him from behind She rakes about in the dirt looking
for a rock or a stick Then she remembers something sticks
her hand in her pocket half smiles

Scene 111Page 81

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I saw a little trail of your blood
back there You must be hurt

Della checks out the bite mark on her arm to find its still
bleeding

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Im hurting too I think you busted
up my collarbone

His black silhouette appears ahead between the gray trees

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I know you can hear me Della

Chuckie sniffs
CHUCKIE
I can smell your blood your sweat
I know youre close
Chuckies eyes glint in the darkness
CHUCKIE
After what went down tonight we

got a special bond

Della listens transfixed
His dark shape beckons to her

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
May as well come out now Della

She doesnt move
She watches him pace around trying to work out where she is

He pulls out a pack of cigarettes taps one out lights it
Inhales Exhales

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Ill save one for you for when you
decide to come out
He inhales again exhales

He laughs admiringly

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Youre one tough bitch

Scene 111Page 82

The tone of his voice begins to change

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
And thats hot hell yeah

Frustration breaks through his voice She can see his shadowy
form moving through the darkness towards her He stops

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
And theyre really cute

Chuckie clicks on the flashlight shines it straight ahead -
right in between the plastic wrapped trees

Della freezes They
Chuckies eyes penetrate the darkness

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Twins huh Terri and Tammi

Della doesnt move Terrified

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I bet you could use that cigarette
now Della honey

(he chuckles)
A womans purse can tell her whole
life story

Della stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in
his jacket He empties the contents out onto the dirt

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Now I know where they are living
Im thinking I may stop by after
and say hello

Della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates
But she also knows thats what he wants and she refuses to
give him the satisfaction

We move in closer on Chuckie Hes looking right at where
shes hiding pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
They wouldnt know a damn thing
about what happened to Mommy while
she was out would they Della

Scene 111Page 83

We move in on Della Her knuckles are blue white and her eyes
are blazing Rage explodes in her She doesnt even realize
that she is shouting till shes done

DELLA
IM GOING TO KILL YOU

Chuckie waltzes towards her hiding place

CHUCKIE
I figured that would help you find
your voice

Della crouches further in behind the felled trees Why the
hell did she shout She could have been hiding anywhere Now
he must know for sure where she is

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Dont worry I would never touch
them Its wrong to hurt kids
Right Della
She clamps her mouth closed Chuckie continues waltzing
toward her stops about twelve feet away He stares in
between the felled trees like he has x-ray vision

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
The games over

Chuckie laughs

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You won

Sadness creeps into his voice

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You took him from meHe was only
seventeen years old And all he
ever wanted to do was see the
ocean And he never saw it No he
never got to go

Chuckies grief sits like a stone in his throat

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Theyre all gone now

Chuckie coughs a dry laboured cough He hocks long and
deeply in his throat But whatever it is he cant spit it
out He rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly

Scene 111Page 84

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You know the movie Clockwork
Orange

Della looks puzzled Yeah and

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Well they were my droogies Della

Chuckie sighs
CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Chances are they would of turned on
me anyway just like in the movie

Chuckie paces around deep in thought

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
None of them was real ass outlaw
No not in the way you are
Youre the real deal lady

He stops

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I was already thinking about
cutting some of em loose getting a
new style posse together

Dellas head is spinning

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Hows about it you and me

This cant be real Has he lost his mind She utters under
her breath

DELLA
Give me a break

Chuckie reaches down retrieves her diary from the dirt She
cringes

CHUCKIE
Monday night mechanics Tuesday
Pilates Wednesday Spanish
Thursday I wish

He closes the diary

Scene 111Page 85

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Face it Della You aint no
suburban housewife

Chuckies eyes dart around in the darkness

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
So you bought into the big lie
even tried to live it Who could
blame you Husband kids security
every womans dream but not yours
Della You know there aint no such
thing as security

He coughs some more
CHUCKIE (CONTD)
But Im betting you didnt really
know who you were until tonight I
reckon I know what youve been
dreaming about though what youve
been aching for through all these
lonely wasted years Blasting out
of Podunk without never looking
back Feeling the wind in your hair
and the dirt of life between your
fingers Doing all the things they
told you you aint supposed to do
Taking what YOU want from life And
wasting anyone who stands in your
way Right Della

She closes her eyes like shes seeing it all behind them

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Dont say you aint thought about
it If its in your blood its in
your blood for all time

A longing sigh sneaks out

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You had yourself fooled Della

A single tear runs down her cheek

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Shit lady you took my whole crew
out with nothing but a bunch of
them tools

She opens her eyes

Scene 111Page 86

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
You cant go back to your old life
No way Its all over for that
Kaboom

She doesnt know what to say
CHUCKIE (CONTD)

Hooking up with mes about the best
chance you got
He sounds deadly serious seductive even Shes lost in some
kind of trance looking like she just might believe him

Can she possibly be believing this

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I bet youre on the outs with your
old man

She inhales sharply

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
When we pick up your kids we can
waste him if you like

She holds the breath in

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
I can do it Or you can if youre
ready

Della exhales responds She seems lost to us

DELLA
I want

But she doesnt finish the sentence She rises slowly from
between the plastic wrapped trees

A momentary grimace of pain crosses her face Then their
eyes meet like for the first time It catches them both by
surprise He smiles

CHUCKIE
Leave the tools

DELLA
I already did

He shines the flashlight on her path so that she can see
where she is walking

Scene 111Page 87

Della steps around the plastic wrapped trees and between the
stumps She heads towards him slowly deliberately

Chuckies hands are by his sides She stops a few feet away
from him
She can see him up close The clearest view of him yet They
both look like theyve been to hell

CHUCKIE
Hell of a night huh

He lays the flashlight on the ground and turns the lens to
point up through the trees and into the sky between them

DELLA
I was only going to the mall for
some Christmas wrapping paper

Chuckie smiles

CHUCKIE
Shit happens

They stare at one another all alone in the night A knowing
moment stretches between them

She notices the gash of matted blood and bruising on his
collarbone

DELLA
What now

Chuckie smiles brings his teeth back into a scary feral
grin

CHUCKIE
I wanted to look you in the eye
before I kill you

Della doesnt react He brings up his hand gun clutched
pointed and ready

Della surprises him and us

DELLA
Thats what I figured

She nods her head points her chin over his shoulder

DELLA (CONTD)
Huey there going to help

Scene 111Page 88

Chuckie is puzzled
CHUCKIE
Huey Hueys

He glances to the side for a split second turns the gun as
he turns his head Its enough Della slips the flare out of
her pocket and opens it in his face

Before he even has time to react she LEAPS at him with all
the spring left in her legs Her fingers close around the
wrist with the gun

The flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them
She crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his
collar bone is broken It makes the ugly noise of sinew

tearing

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
CHRIST

She tumbles him down to the December ground and wraps her
legs tight around him Tight like a lover

She grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his
broken collarbone exacerbating the wound

He cries out thrashes about She keeps her body melded to
his grinding her chin even deeper

He wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even
closer wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone

They roll across the dirt He whispers low and close to
ner

CHUCKIE (CONTD)
Youre even better than I thought

He pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin
returning to the wound She tries to pull away but he only
presses harder

Neither can break away

Its unclear whos got the gun

They roll until she suddenly pulls away sits up

But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock

Scene 111Page 89

And she has the gun

They look at each other He smiles

He makes for the gun

She fires into his chest just once its enough

His legs release He slumps back Blood darkens his shirt
Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound Blood seeps

below him from the exit wound spreading out in a dark
puddle

His body surrenders to death

She stares down at him A queasy silent moment passes She
stares at the gun in her hands It feels so heavy so unreal

His dead eyes stare She reaches over and closes them gently

And shes light-headed so light-headed she could just float
away Somehow she stands up

She looks back down at the body not quite believing he could
be dead She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the
pool of blood

She retrieves it Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from
its exterior Inside the photos of her kids are still there
tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terris
mischievous one look back at her She snaps the locket
closed

She searches the area for the rest of her belongings finds
her wallet her purse her diary her lighter her tampax
box a lipstick in the dirt She sticks everything in her
purse She almost misses her pack of cigarettes We see them
half buried under the dirt She scans the area once more
finds them The pack is empty but she takes it anyway

Its time to go home

EXT WOODS - EVENING

Without really thinking about it Della slips the gun into
her pocket and starts running

Tree after tree disappears behind her until she sees the
light ahead That place where the rest of the world meets the
woods

Scene 112Page 90

She peers through the last layer of trees like she would a
curtain to her other reality the one she almost left behind

The housing development is still there and not more than a
hundred feet away is her car

She hears the sound of distant sirens

EXT PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING

She hurries across the clearing towards her car Sees the
trunk is open Sees sheets of wrapping paper blowing about
Sees the big red bow tangled around a pine

She quickly gathers them stuffs them in her purse

A moment of trepidation as she reaches her car What if its
locked What if the keys are gone

She presses the Fords driver door handle and much to her
relief it opens She sees the keys still dangling from the
ignition

INT EXPLORER- EVENING
She climbs into the drivers seat and turns the key No
connection No surprises there

EXT PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING

She steps back out of the car and looks nervously around like
nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again

The hood is still ajar by a few inches the weight of pine
branches still pressing upon it She uses the last of her
strength to try push them away A few smaller branches give
way but the bigger one wont budge

She reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard It
scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it
to prop the hood open to its maximum about fifteen inches

The hood buckles but theres enough room for her to reach in

She fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose
from its attachment to the battery She re-attaches the wire
and Presto the car lights up and the keys start to ping

She almost smiles as she forces the bar back down The hood
slams down after it

Scene 116Page 91

INT FORD - EVENING

She quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys The
engine sputters but doesnt fully catch She turns the keys

again - another wimpy sputter Again this time the sputter

gathers momentum catches for a second gives up She tries

again the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real

Della looks over her shoulder and backs up pulls out of the
tree up and past the broken barrier and onto the road She
makes a tight U-Turn sticks the car into four wheel drive
and plows down the rough gravely road

EXT ROUGH ROAD - EVENING
She passes the Plymouth on her way Sees its wheels lodged
deep in the mud Keeps going

EXT EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

She drives right on through the ghostly housing estate
slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves
Empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind

The lights of the mall grow closer

INT FORD EXPLORER- EVENING

She passes that stop sign sighs The barrier is open and the
road up to the mall stretches freely ahead She slowly inches
out on to the road and commits to her return to
civilization

EXT MALL ROAD - EVENING

The roads empty

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
She punches the accelerator drives just over the speed

Scene 123Page 92

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 18
She hears the siren before she sees the police car
God she hopes they dont notice her smashed up windscreen
the fucked up side of the Ford

EXT MALL ROAD - EVENING

She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars Watches as the
police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall
road to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance
road blocked off

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Of course How long has it been That poor security guard

She checks the car clock Its only 85 minutes since she left
the house Hard to believe Feels like another lifetime

Another cop car whizzes past the line How long before they
come for her Shes got to get back to the kids

Della adjusts the rearview mirror Her gaunt bloody face
looks back

DELLA
Oh my

She looks at her hands theyre ingrained with mud and blood
And her clothes

While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she
fumbles on the passenger seat finds some kleenex

She wipes her hands her face using the rearview mirror
some Kleenex and the rest of the water She looks only
slightly better

The line starts moving Della follows She passes the police
cars steals a cursory glance

She keeps checking her face in the mirror The cars soon
start to disperse in different directions The Mall
disappears behind her She turns left onto an almost empty
road

She cant wait to see her babies make sure theyre okay How
could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like
this

Scene 125Page 93

She hits forty forty-five fifty Takes it all the way up to
sixty Runs a light

EXT RAILWAY ROAD - EVENING

As long as the roads empty shes gonna own it

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

At sixty-five she races across the railway track She slows
down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on
the adjoining road

With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from
her purse

She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so
parched it just cakes into her chapped lips She wipes it
away

EXT CROSSROADS - EVENING

She drives through the crossroads

INT FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some
color But she just looks odd She ends up wiping it away
with the back of her hand

Gosh this car in front is really taking its sweet time She
decides to overtake She accelerates to sixty As she passes
the driver stares at her car

She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion She
passes the familiar sign for Pleasant Valley Drive The
roads empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five

The closer she gets to home the faster she wants to go She
tries to resist but cant The speedometer hits seventy

The car hurtles into the night Oh No a red light ahead And
a car waiting to go in the opposite direction She decides to
slow for this one Barely makes it - screeches to a halt The
driver in the forward facing car checks her out She attempts
to smile and look like a normal housewife

EXT PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING

She waits for the car to pass then hits the accelerator
again She signals right turns abruptly into meet the gates
of Pleasant valley Dream Homes

Scene 130Page 94

She rakes about in her purse for her chub card cant find
it She presses the intercom No one answers She presses
again Still no answer She backs out hard onto Pleasant
Valley Drive Luckily for her the car she overtook a few
minutes earlier pulls in She tails the car tightly through
the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers But
shes in

She guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she
approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard Checks
herself in the mirror Pulls into the boulevard

When she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her She
snorts it back Not yet Her face hurts so bad with repressed

emotion that it feels like its made of stone

She pulls into the driveway Smooths her coat

She glances at the gun which lies on the passenger seat
She turns off the ignition

She looks back at the gun She removes the car keys from the
ignition

She glances at the gun
She looks at the house it all looks normal
She takes a deep breath

She moves to get out of the car

She leans over grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse She
finds her chub card inside She sighs

EXT DELLAS HOUSE - EVENING

She remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the
car That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed
behind her That her heart hurts when she sees the star of

the tree still lying there in the snow

The whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the
windshield is shattered She makes her way down the path to
the front door She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the
front step Turns the adjoining key on the car key chain in
the front door lock Pushes open the door
