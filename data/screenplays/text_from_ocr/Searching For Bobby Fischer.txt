SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER

A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of a young man all but his eyes 1
obscured by the long-fingered hand supporting not so much his
head as the weight of his thoughts

JOSHS VOICE
In the days before the event he had
the whole world wondering if he would
show up

The eyes are riveted to a point nearby and yet behind then
vast and mysterious schemes are being plotted

JOSHS VOICE
Plane after plane waited on the runway
while he napped or took walks and ate
sandwiches

The unseen puzzle enthralls and intrigues him Moving in close
on the eyes

JOSHS VOICE
Henry Kissinger called and asked him
to go for his country’s honor

NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of the young man emerging from an airplane 2
shielding his eyes against the low Icelandic sun with his

large hands He descends the steps to the tarmac and is
engulfed by a crush of reporters and dignitaries and curious
spectators As he’s hustled into the backseat of a waiting

car the legend - REYKJAVIC ICELAND 1972 appears

JOSHS VOICE
Soon after arriving he offended the
Icelanders by calling their country
inadequate because it had no bowling
alleys

Inside the cavernous Laugersdalholl Stadium workmen lay 3
down carpet to muffle footsteps baffle cameras with burlap
replace folding seats with upholstered soundless chairs

JOSHS VOICE
He complained about the TV cameras
about the lighting about the table
and chairs and the contrast of the
squares on the board His hotel room
he said had too nice a view
Fpased 0601 82 2

The enormous hall filled to capacity Tournament officials 4
pacing below the stage checking their watches Boris Spassky
at a mahogany chess table waiting his first move already
made The Eames executive swivel chair flown in from Buenos
Aires and placed opposite him is conspicuously empty

JOSHS VOICE
None of this had anything to do with
chess of course or maybe it did If
he won he’d be the first American
world champion in history if he lost
he’d just be another patzer from
Brooklyn

The young man in the plain dark suit arrives late settles into
the leather chair considers the board a moment and pushes his
Knight to his King Bishop’s third square Close on the time
clock on the table the seconds ticking away

JOSH’S VOICE
On the 40th move of the 21st game he
countered Spassky’s bishop to King-6
with a pawn to Rook-4 and it was all
over

The cover of Time Magazine featuring the young man’s 5
impassive countenance sculpted onto a chess plece like a

marble bust of a Roman emperor The covers of Newsweek

Sports Illustrated and Life

JOSHS VOICE
He came home an American hero He’d
bragged to the world hed beat the
Russians and he delivered

Seated rather uncomfortably across from Dick Cavett the 6
young man explains It’s like war on a board the object is
to crush the other man’s mind

JOSH’S VOICE
He could now command the same money
as heavyweight prizefighters He was
invited to dinner by statesmen and
kings

Henry Kissinger proudly introduces the young man to Richard 7
Nixon In the streets of Brooklyn crowds of people swirl
around him seeking his autograph

JOSHS VOICE
Then Bobby Fischer made the most
original and unexpected move of all

his large hand his eyes intent on his mission

JOSHS VOICE
He disappeared

THE PHOTOGRAPH is swallowed by darkness - and from the darkness
comes a voice -

- MERLIN
I have a tale to tell

9 INT GROVE STREET THEATRE - DAY A flash of light and a puff of smoke and a six year old boy’s
eyes widening Medieval Noblemen and Ladies (and the children
in the audience) gasp as the bearded wizard Merlin appears from
the smoke -

MERLIN
A great darkness descended
over all of Britain the day our
beloved King Uther died For 18 years
now we’ve lived in disorder and
misery suffering the arrogance and
wars of lesser kings and knights
battling for the crown that belongs to
none of them

under the footlights the boy with his mother father little
cister and friends watches the magician

MERLIN
For while there are many among you
who appear worthy there stands among
you only one who truly is

Against the painted backdrop the costumed actors glance
curiously among themselves Eventually a young man in peasant
clothes steps shyly across to Merlin

MERLIN
Entrusted to me at birth for his
safety the true-born son of Uther
Pendragon and Lady Igrayne -- Prince Arthur

NOBLEMED
This the son of a king Impossible
Hes just a stable boy He cleans our
stalls

ARTHUR

MERLIN
Yes you are

The young stable boy steps away toward a sword embedded in a
stone but then hesitates glancing back at the magician warily
To the audience -

MERLIN
Only he who is pure of heart can take
“the sword from the stone

Arthur grasps the handle and pulls the sword easily out
There’s another gasp from the assembled crowd on stage while
down below the six year old’s parents smile at each other at
the look of awe on their son’s face

MERLIN
The rightful heir to the throne of
England wiser and greater than even
his father - King Arthur

As Arthur returns with the beautiful sword to stand at the
wizard’s side the others kneel and bow and scrape

NOBLEMEN
Long live Arthur - God bless Arthur
Long live King Arthur -

Distant thunder booms

EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE SAME DAY

In the grey gloom of a threatening storm the boy his sister
and friends each with a handmade foam sword hide in a thicket
whispering Do you see him I don’t see him where is he

A figure the boy’s father appears behind them It takes them
a moment to realize he’s there but when they do they scatter
running through a forest

Across the park the boy’s mother plants seven candles ina
cake decorated with plastic cars and the words Happy Birthday
Josh Glancing up she considers the gathering clouds overhead
with a measure of dread

Josh dives behind the trunk of a tree and tries to catch his
breath He hears footsteps and crouches lower as the torn shoes
of someone big walk past Head close to ground now he notices
a small dark object in the fall leaves and reaches to unearth
it

It’s an elaborate carving of a knight on horseback He turns
it over in his hands examining its detail before voices draw his
glance around the side of the tree

Close on-armies of small faceless men standing in confused
disarray A hand in a tattered wool glove without fingertips
shoves a bishop across a marble table and swats at a time
clock Worn-out shoes over mismatched socks tap a cadence
like soldiers’ drums

Wind howls through the trees but Josh hardly notices He’s
intrigued by the figurines on the chess board plainer than the
one in his hand but still discernible as horses and castles and
kings

Lightning flashes across the checkered battlefield as the
overcast sky opens up above unleashing torrents of rain on the
cheap plastic chessmen Hands rake them from the boards and
into paper bags Elsewhere people scatter

Joshs mother groans at the sound of crashing thunder and
hurriedly re-covers the cake He hears her calling him his
father too and turns to find himself in the shadow of an
imposing black man in a torn sweater muddy pants

There’s a weathered baseball in the man’s leathery hand He
holds it out in offering but when Josh reaches for it he draws
it back He wants the chess piece clutched in the boy’s hand in
exchange His eyes say It’s a fair trade

INT JOSHS BEDROOM THAT NIGHT ll

Rain snaking down a window Dinosaur night lamp on the ledge
Closer here drops of glistening liquid from a red and white
can of 3-in-1 oil upside down fall through space and into the
pocket of a brand new baseball mitt Almost a whisper

Theyre revealed finally inside a bunk bed draped with sheets
like a fort Josh with pajamas printed with cowboys and
Indians his father Fred wearing a look of bewilderment

JOSH

FRED
I forgot to buy a ball - I can’t

Josh reaches across to his nightstand rummages through the
clutter and hands his father not a baseball but rather
one of those tourist spheres with snowflakes in it He unscrews
it from its base

FRED
Yeah that’1l work

He buries the little globe in the pocket and sticks the glove
under the mattress
FRED

Josh crawls under the covers Fred leans in across scattered
baseball cards and kisses his son on the forehead

Fred lets the flap of the fort close down and navigates past
toys and games and books and the wrapping paper they came in

As the overhead light goes out a nightlight in a socket
automatically switches on

Silence Then inside the fort a flashlight snaps on
illuminating the knight on horseback in Josh’s hand Fascinated
with it he can just hear the pounding of horses’ hoofs and

the clang of iron swords which

Are you feeling all right

JOSH

BONNTE
You’re fine but you don’t want pizza

JOSH
Hey I know You want to go watch the

Bonnie considers her son blankly she has no idea what he’s
talking about

BONNIE
What men in the park

EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY 15

The usual suspects hunched over the marble tables in the
southwest corner of the park - hustlers and junkies and emigrant
masters like Israel Zilber a mad bearded Russian - playing
chess backgammon and cards

The preferred hustle here is blitz - chess with a time limit
of a few minutes at the outside - a fast and furious progression
punctuated by pieceslamming and clock-banging

Money changes hands under a sign that reads No Gambling
The residents of one bank of tables drug dealers consider
the lady with the stroller and the little boy

BONNIE
Come on Josh let’s go

Uncomfortable here even if she weren’t with her children Bonnie
tries to pull Josh away But it’s no good he’s fascinated by
the look of the game the action and the shape of the pieces
hardly noticing the players themselves

A handsome young man emerges from a cluster of spectators to
consider the derelict players The black man from before
nursing a paper cup of coffee jerks his head at the junkie
perched across from hin

VINNIE
Go sit on a bench man I got a fish

The junkie doesn’t move - until Vinnie kicks at him under the
table He gets up and stumbles away finally and the young man
approaches Clearly out of his element whatever that might be
he offers the black man in a soft voice --

SHIRAZI
Dollar a game

Vinnie pretends to notice him for the first time and after
considering him a moment -

VINNIE
Yeah sure why not

As the young man takes a seat Vinnie sets the hands of his
beat-up chess clock and places it back on the marble top

VINNIE
Two minutes

The young man nods The game begins The chessmen flow into
lines of attack paced by the nerve-racking snap of the clock
and Vinnie plays to the crowd that’s moving closer to watch

VINNIE
You should get out more you look
like a vampire Is that what you are
a vampire You look like a vampire

The cerebral game of chess as Vinnie plays it more resembles
pinball His pieces challenge the other man’s joust ambush
plunge off the rim of the table to the ground

VINNIE

You know how to kill a vampire You
got to put a stake in his heart You
ot to put a stake in his heart drive
it in bam You gotta drive it in
you gotta kill him before he kills
you bam You gotta make sure he’s
dead you gotta kil him ban

Someone in the crowd whispers the name Shirazi that’s Kamran
Shirazi and Vinnie glances over to Zilber while he plays The
bearded man nods almost imperceptibly and Vinnie sneers at the
pale young man across from hin

VINNIE
You’re nothing but a fish
Grandmaster You’re nothing you’re a
dog You’re the dog of the world
You’re a patzer Shirazi

BONNIE
Come on Josh

Oblivious to the rest Josh’s eyes follow the movement of the
chessmen the diagonal slide of the bishops the lateral path of
the rooks the L-shaped journey of the knights

VINNIE
You got nothing Oh you want to
trade queens Fine bam done

BONNIE
Josh come on

gonna come into my office and take my
money is that what you think Huh
Look at me when I talk to you is that

Shirazi fights not to look at him even as the flag on his clock

falls Vinnie smiles the young man has lost the game on time

beyond children in motion on the ground with a checkers board
covered with small plastic chess men

acutely aware of it and reaching a corner turns it with her

EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE DAY 19

Israel Zilber wearing a naval cap sheriffs badge and garish
costume jewelry on his fingers stares up at the squirrels in
the trees and sings to them in Russian

BONNIE
Excuse me sir

Glancing down Zilber finds standing before him a nervous woman
clutching the hands of a little girl and boy

of chess with you

Bonnie fishes a dollar from her wallet and cautiously holds it
out to the drunken Russian madman Zilber considers the boy
long and critically before snapping the bill out of his mother’s
hand like a trout striking a shiny lure

Josh sits His face doesn’t reach much beyond the rim of the
table He peers through the chess pieces as if through the
trees of an impenetrable forest

to correctly move the pieces stares at her son like he might
belong to somebody else

Zilber captures a knight Josh gangs up on a rook with his
queen and a bishop Zilber slips away but not before eyeing
briefly and suspiciously this small boy sitting across from
him At the next table Vinnie smiles to himself

Josh tries to protect his king as Zilber advances with his

knight and does so throwing a look across the room to his wife

Bobby Fischer was six when his mother
moved the family to a small apartment
near Ebbetts Field

36 The image of the chessmen dissolves into the same black and 36
white photograph as before of chessmen on a board under the
concentrated gaze of BOBBY FISCHER head in his large hand

JOSHS VOICE
At night when the traffic noise died
down he could hear the roar of the
crowd from the stadium

37 There’s no roar now it’s absolutely silent as the image of 37
Fischer is replaced by an old photograph of a four-story brick
building above a candy store in Brooklyn circa 1950

JOSH’S VOICE
His sister brought home games to amuse
him while their mother was at work
Monopoly Parcheesi Chess

38 SILENT NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of the Brooklyn Dodgers taking 38
batting practice in their baggy uniforms

JOSHS VOICE
They learned how to move the pieces
from the instructions inside the box

39 Now there’s a faint roar of a crowd as the image of the 39
ballplayers dissolves back to the photograph of the brick
building moving in toward a window on the third floor

JOSHS VOICE
Even though she was five years older
she was soon no match for him It
became more interesting for him to
play against himself He’d play both
sides of the board equally hard
careful to be fair

intently at the chess position below him

Cacophony of echoing sounds and music Stage mothers and
fathers loitering and smoking outside hardwood-floored rehearsal
halls As Josh and Fred move along the corridor they glimpse
through the doorways children in leotards tap shoes and with
clarinets

They reach a door at the end of the hall obstructed by an old
crone of a woman with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth A
sign identifies what lies beyond as the Manhattan Chess Club

FRED
Excuse us

The woman considers the man and the boy with the bag of Gummi
Bears a long moment before stepping aside allowing them
passage

INT MANHATTAN CHESS CLUB CONTINUOUS DAY 43

Yellowing photographs of unsmiling men look down from crooked
dusty picture frames Cigarette smoke cloaks the deeper
recesses of the club Worn Victorian furniture sits on
unpolished wooden floors

Fred surveys the shadowy room and its denizens hunched over oak
and-mahogany chess tables Josh notices a Coke machine

JOSH

Fred hands him some change and he moves off passing a

disheveled man in a wrinkled corduroy jacket with a mop and
bucket of cleaning supplies and

Fred watches for Bruce whoever Bruce is to respond to his name
and come forth to mediate the dispute But he doesn’t Indeed

the only club employee present appears to be the janitor and he

completely ignores the squabble

Josh wanders over to a sallow-faced regular sitting alone ina
far corner restructuring a game from an old issue of Chess
Life

JOSH

Glancing up to see who has spoken the man’s sunken eyes stall
at the bag of Gummi Bears in the boy’s hand

Josh hands him the bag The man carefully extracts a Gummi
Bear looks up again and mouths two He gets a nod takes
another and returns the bag Josh hands him a can of Coke

JOSH

Fred notices the janitor on the phone now and takes a closer
look There’s a scarf draped around his shoulders Fred hadn’t
noticed before like veneer on an aristocrat who’s hit rock
bottom

He sighs at the insulting offer and endures the caller’s many
excuses for why the chapter can’t pay more

PANDOLFINI
Yeah okay I’ll be there I’m

man moves around the room dumping ashtrays then approaches
again

FRED
I was talking to the guy at my paper
‘who writes the chess column He told
me I could find Bruce Pandolfini here
Are you him

Pandolfini neither confirms nor denies it which Fred takes as
affirmation

FRED
I’m looking for a teacher for my son

PANDOLFINI
I don’t teach anymore

FRED
He was sure you did

PANDOLFINI
I don’t

Pandolfini dismisses Fred unceremoniously by carrying on with
his chores Distracted though by incessant clockbanging
across the club he glances over

Across the room a few of the regulars have wandered over to
watch the game of blitz played furiously by the boy whose untied
shoes don’t even reach the floor As Fred comes past -

JOSH
Just a second

Pandolfini moves to his desk to sift through the mail but can’t
shut out the sure slam of the pieces and the swatting of the
Clock He resists looking again but the sounds themselves tell
more of the story than he wants to hear

Suddenly it’s still as Josh’s opponent stares at an intolerable
predicament Finally without a word he knocks down his own
king Josh glances to his father uncertain of the meaning

- FRED
He’s resigning the game to you
Let’s go

Josh gets up from the table and starts to leave but then
steps back and holds out the last of the Gummi Bears The man
stares at them and the boy struck by his kindness and
gratefully accepts then

REGULAR
Thank you
Pandolfini wedges his mop against the men’s room door Behind
him he can hear the receding footsteps of the newspaper man and
his son leaving the club He gets down on his hands and knees
and begins scrubbing out a toilet

just happened to be passing by on his way home Israel Zilber
notices him knows him nods hello and gestures with a slight
tip of his head toward Josh

ZILBER

Pandolfini shrugs Zilber shrugs If they hadn’t in fact
been waiting for the last twenty years for the “young Fischer
to appear the New Messiah they could perhaps shrug it off
convincingly

That’s a passive move Josh and

Josh looks to his mother for approval of the idea He’s
absolutely serious concerned for Vinnie’s welfare

Josh helmeted warms up with a bat in the on-deck circle

At the plate one of his teammates smacks a grounder through the
legs of a three and half foot third baseman and makes it all the
way to second before the ball is relayed back to the infield
The coach Fred hollers enthusiastic praise from the sidelines

As Josh comes up to bat Pandolfini steps across the risers of
the bleachers In his jacket and scarf carrying his briefcase
he looks terribly out of place Josh spots him and waves The
chess teacher waves back and takes a seat next to Bonnie and

It’s hard to tell from this distance The crowd is around one

much for either of them to ignore It’s very unusual They
exchange a glance both thinking the same thing

JOSH
It’s Bobby Fischer

They get up quickly and hurry across the park reach the
perimeter of the crowd Already they can hear the slam of
pieces against marble and the banging of a clock Using his
diminutive size to his advantage Josh wedges past the frames of
the adults reaches the inner-circle and sees

Not Bobby Fischer but a boy Josh’s age perched opposite
Zilber taking him apart His little hands slap the pieces down
cutting off the Russian master’s desperate attempts to flee
toppling his men knocking them to the ground

Its a ferocious attack cold and merciless He’s like a
machine in boy’s clothing devastating Zilber humiliating hin
crushing hin

Josh stares with morbid fascination He’s never seen anything
like it This pint-sized Black Knight with long hair and neon-
colored surfer shorts is dispatching the old Russian’s few
remaining pieces with vicious glee

standing behind the boy watching the slaughter smugly Who are

FRED

Yeah I do He’s playing better than

PANDOLFINI

How would you know that

Of course Fred can’t know it There’s no way he can follow the
intricacies of Josh’s game

FRED
You’re right I don’t know What I
know is that he likes playing again
for the first time in a long time

Pandolfini’s shrug wholly discounts the importance of the
remark Eventually -

PANDOLFINI
I know you think what youre doing
is the best thing for him But I got
to tell you I think you’re setting him
up for the biggest disappointment of
his life

Silence Fred shrugs to say Well that may be but there’s
nothing else I can do

PANDOLFINI
That kid from California isn’t spending
his afternoons riding bikes and
playing Pac Man I guarantee you that

FRED
I’m doing the only thing I know how
to do for Josh I don’t know what
else to do

PANDOLFINI
No No this is different You have
no idea what a fall like this can do
to you

Fred considers the disheveled chess teacher standing before him
for a long moment

FRED
I think I do

Long silence
FRED
You know what You should come down
with us I know it’d mean a lot to
him to have you there

Pandolfini glances away then back finally and offers the same
shake of the head

PANDOLFINI
That I can’t do

Fred’s shrug says Well then that’s that Pandolfini waits
around a moment more for a sign that Fred might reconsider what
he’s said but when it doesn’t come he turns and leaves
Fred watches him disappear

congratulating him Vinnie waves the long-saved scrap of
newspaper with Josh Waitzkin scribbled on the masthead
telling everyone he used to play him in the park

JOSH
(to Fred)
I tried to give him a way out

FRED
I know

And he’s proud of him for it Josh’s glance finds Pandolfini
standing off to the side he knows too and is just as proud
Josh sees something else and steps down -

It’s Morgan holding back tears at having lost his own last
game and his father trying to get him to replay the final game
of the tournament Josh puts his arm around the smaller boy’s
shoulder and guides him across the crowded hall to the doors

EXT HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY 259

From the windows Fred watches as Josh guides his distraught
friend across the deserted courtyard Bonnie comes over beside
her husband and watches the two small figures moving under the
trees

Close on the boys

JOSH
I know what you’re feeling and I can’t
make it go away I wish I could but
I can’t But you know what I’m
going to tell you a secret

The younger boy wipes at his eyes as he looks up at Josh who
somehow seems standing here much older than the year that
separates them

JOSH
You’re a much stronger player than I
was at your age

He puts his arm around Morgan and they move off walking slowly
talking quietly beginning to heal

FADE TO BLACK
