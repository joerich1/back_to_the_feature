THE BIJOU

REVISED DRAFT

October 14 1997

the magic is all around you
All the time Everywhere
In every thing

The trick is to see it

IN BLACK

the insistent persistent eight-to-the-bar beat of
BOOGIE-WOOGIE Hot exciting pulsating rhythm ramping up
THEN

in the blackness falling s-l-o-w-l-y tumbling
g-e-n-t-l-y a picture-postcard

GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD

Then another and another each one dropping through frame
a gentle rain

In these old postcards Hollywood is a dream town where movie
stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and-
footprints in the wet cement

Another postcard
IM MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD and VINE

In this postcard myth youd toddle down to Hollywood and
Vine bump into Bogie and Bacall and join them for dinner at
the Brown Derby Or Ciros Or the Coconut Grove

More postcards Pictures of movie theaters but not the ones
that you and I know today These are palaces Temples
Graumans Chinese and Egyptian The Carthay Circle The
Paramount the Million Dollar From a time when moviegoing
was a complete experience not a trip to the local mall The
ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded
jackets and guided you to your seat The popcorn was hot and
fresh and buttered with real butter not 30-weight motor oil

cut To
THE PILE OF POSTCARDS

a wild jumble Then one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top
of the pile Its a view of Hollywood at night a carpet of
lights under the yawning protective smile of Mt Lees most
famous resident the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN We PUSH INTO
THE PICTURE OF THE SIGN DISSOLVING UNTIL WERE

PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN closer and closer
until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and
behind it until were looking down at

EXT HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT
SUPER TITLE 1951

A gigantic aerial shot Postwar autos fill the muggy
midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING
HORNS a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come Darkened
outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home
construction boom as scores of stucco bungalows are being
built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town
a swath of garishly bright concrete called

HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD

PETES NARRATION (VO)
Of course its not like the
postcards say it is This is what
its like Im Pete Appleton and
this is my town

Still in the same shot we rocket down into the center of the
intersection of Hollywood and Vine then head west along the
boulevard skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and
Franks Grill and the Hollywood Canteen past the Egyptian
Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car across
Highland Avenue past the Paramount Theater and across the
street to

GRAUMANS CHINESE THEATER

PETES NARRATION (VO)
Born and raised here thank you
very much Sometimes it seems
like everyone here is from
somewhere else But everyone loves
the movies so Hollywood is
everyones town and they come here
by the busload To them Graumans
Chinese Theater is just about the
most exciting place on the planet
To me its the theater thats
playing The African Queen

And like the man said the film on the marquee is THE
AFRICAN QUEEN Still the same shot buses disgorge
TOURISTS who move into the forecourt of the theater The
MEN doff their hats and mop their brows The WOMEN pull
their blouses away from their chests fanning themselves with
movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks
We MOVE AMONG THEM until we pick up A COUPLE and we stay
behind them as they work their way through the crowd on
their way to

THE THEATER ENTRANCE

where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their
tickets
DOORMAN
Newsreels just starting folks

PETES NARRATION (VO)
Thats me and my girlfriend Her
name is Sandra Sinclair and this
is her town too -- shes from
Cleveland She came out here to be
an actress and thats just what
shes doing The first picture I
ever wrote a little potboiler
called Sand Pirates of the

Sahara Okay it aint Citizen
Kane but you gotta start
somewhere

MOVING INTO THE LOBBY

an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend
Everywhere you look its red and orange and plush carpeting
and golden light We MOVE THROUGH the lobby still in the
same shot still tracking the couple heading for the
auditorium doors which are swept open by two ramrod-erect
USHERS and we move into

THE DARKENED THEATER

As the couple Pete and Sandra find seats we HEAR the
soundtrack of the film before we see the screen the

unmistakable strains of a march and then -- still in the
same shot -- we see the screen
A NEWSREEL

As the march SWELLS to a crescendo we HEAR THE NEWSREEL
ANNOUNCERS SONOROUS VOICE

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Bringing the news of the world to
you

Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee
Hearing Room a title blares HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Four years ago in one of
filmlands darkest hours ten men
the so-called Hollywood Ten were
called to testify before the House
Committee of Un-American
Activities investigating the
proliferation of the dreaded Red
Menace in Hollywood

We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal
battles with congressmen especially Committee Chairman T
JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel ELVIN CLYDE

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Refusing to answer the lawmakers
questions cowering behind the
Fifth Amendments protection
against self-incrimination the ten
motion picture writers dared
Congress to come after them Well
come after them they did And
after years of court wrangling
its now time to pay the piper

Over shots of several of the Hollywood Ten being led to
jail in handcuffs the newsreel narration continues

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
And so its off to jail the
charge Contempt of Congress This
should give you fellas something to
write about now A new round of
investigations begins this fall
the mandate Get the reds out of
Hollywood

In the audience one man YELLS Lock up the commie

bastards

and a few others cheer and laugh As the

newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject we
WHEEL AROUND AND

ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR

Petes a handsome fellow in his 30s and Sandras a starlet
pretty girl in her mid-20s As she rummages in her purse
Pete watches the newsreel

SANDRA
Pete theres time before the
picture starts you want to get
some popcorn

PETE
You bet honey

Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek then stands and sprints up
the aisle to the concession stand a big unworried grin on

his face

CUT TO
INT WRITERS BUILDINGPETES OFFICE - DAY

Prominent on the wall is a framed SAND PIRATES OF THE
SAHARA poster Pete reaches up and takes it down He leans
it up against the desk then sits heavily in the wooden
swivel chair He swivels around to see

A STUDIO SECURITY GUARD
standing by the door Hes watching Petes every move

Two boxes sit on the desk partially packed with Petes
belongings Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk
drawer He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the
desk He looks at the cover of the first one

SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA
By Peter Appleton

A United Pictures Production
February 19 1951

Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the
second one
ASHES TO ASHES
By Peter Appleton

He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box
which contains somewhat more personal items A ragged gold
pillow with tassels Legal pads of notes An old tin-toy
fire truck its bright red paint chipped and worn He turns
it around in his hands

PETE
(musing)
Huh Red

Footsteps approach and Pete swivels toward the door

During this last Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling
away from Pete

PETE
A lot of good people are being
accused of things they didnt do
Hell even if I was a communist

person should be able to be
whatever they want to be Right

Sandra glances at the Guard who is watching everything

SANDRA
(nervously)
Of course but I I dont know

communist it can ruin your
career

Pete sees where this is going Shes edging toward the door

PETE

SANDRA
Ill have to think about this I

And shes out the door and gone in the blink of an eye Pete
looks at the Guard

PETE
So nice to be a pariah

The Guard turns away Pete moves back toward the boxes
Rummaging again he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels
with barely one swig left He regards the bottle for a
moment looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isnt)
pops the cork puts it to his lips and drains it He looks
at it thoughtfully as we

night and getting quieter as several PATRONS are just
leaving waving goodbye to the bartender JERRY early 40s
Jerry turns to Pete eyes him suspiciously from the end of
the bar Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot

EXT FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT

Pete takes a few steps stumbles stops takes a deep breath
then totters briskly towards his car He hauls the door open
and sits inside heavily

INT EXT PETES CAR - NIGHT

Sitting slumped against the steering wheel Pete looks as
though he could fall asleep right there which would probably
be a good idea

PETE
(mumbling)
Drive Drive Bad idea Too
drunk to drive

He looks at his watch
PETE
One-thirty Huh Early Cant go
home yet

He turns the key and hits the starter The engine hums to
life Pete sits up opens his eyes wide shakes off the haze
and puts the car in gear

The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards screeches to a halt
and stalls

PETE
Oops

He re-starts the car puts it in gear and pulls away and
down the deserted boulevard

DISSOLVE TO
EXT SANTA MONICA BEACH AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT

The full moon is low over the ocean Petes car is parked at
the edge of the sand the water fifty yards away The ferris
wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark
and eerie silhouettes lit only by moonlight Pete is asleep
in the drivers seat head tilted back his hat covering his
face snoring

The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake

PETE
Huh Whatsa

Instantly he grabs his head

PETES NARRATION (VO)
I had no idea how I got to Santa
Monica but it certainly was a good
idea I dont think I couldve
faced the headache I had alone in
my apartment At least I had the
ocean air

Pete takes a deep breath and starts coughing He gets out
his cigarettes and lights up He takes a puff and glances at
his watch

PETES NARRATION (VO)
Three forty-five I had only been
there for a couple of hours at
most Truth be told I was still
fairly drunk

He starts the car and heads for the highway
PETES NARRATION (VO)

up or I ran out of gas whichever

H

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Pete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop Waves crash
to the shore below the roadway

INT EXT PETES CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Pete is finally relaxed He takes off his hat and jams it
down in the back seat He takes a deep breath -- with the
wind in his hair a smile grows on his face and he seems at
peace He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the
fuel gauge

INSERT - FUEL GAUGE
Pinning on empty

PETE
Shit

PETES NARRATION (VO)
Guess which came first

He scans the road ahead -- nothing Glances to his right

PETES POV
The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance

Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that
will take him toward the lights He passes a hand-painted
sign that gives him hope GAS - 1 MI

CUT TO
EXT RORYS GAS STATION - NIGHT

Petes car rolls up and stops Theres a light on the sign
and another in the stations window but the place is
deserted

PETES NARRATION (VO)
I shouldve known better than to
think that a service station in the
sticks would be open at this hour
but it wasnt like I had a lot of
choices
Pete looks ahead toward the town Its few lights twinkle in
the distance

PETES NARRATION (VO)
What the hell At least thered be
a diner opening in a couple of
hours Id get some pie and
coffee and then I could worry
about the gas

Pete pulls out onto the road
EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Petes car trundles along blowing past a hand-painted
roadside sign which reads

SLow

NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL
USE CAUTION

INT EXT PETES CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Petes headlights catch a glimpse of another sign reading
LAWSON WASH just in front of a small wooden auto bridge

Barely reducing his speed Pete heads onto the bridge
HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless
possum

Pete swerves to avoid the animal and a wheel drops off the
edge

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and
into the rapidly-moving water below

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The water is flowing very quickly and the current is
intense Pete pulls himself out of the drivers seat
(thankfully its a convertible) and swims over the
windshield

But his left sleeve is caught on the door handle Nearly
out of breath and panicking Pete shucks off the jacket and
heads for the surface
EXT THE WASH - NIGHT

Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air His fight isnt
over yet as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream
He swims with all his might toward the far bank

EXT FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT

Drained Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to
his feet

PETE
(gasping)
Oh my god I dont believe oh
my god
He stumbles along backwards a couple of steps and his heel
hits a rock
Pete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow

on another rock He rolls down the bank unconscious and
lands face down in the mud

CUT TO BLACK

N BLACK we slowly become aware of a panting breathing
sound -- the sound of a dog

FADE IN
ON A DOGS FACE

A yellow labrador full frame It takes a couple more
sniffs then starts licking furiously

OLD MANS VOICE (0S)
Maggie whatcha got there Huh
girl Whatcha find

EXT FAR BANK OF THE WASH - DAWN

Pete is still laying face down on the bank being fervently
licked in the face by the dog

ON THE OLD MAN
A no-nonsense sort in his late-60s he wears overalls and an
old railroad cap He comes down to Pete and using his

walking stick pokes him in the side

OLD MAN
Mister who are ya my dog likes

Pete blinks up at the Old Man his mouth gaping open

OLD MAN

He sits up and the Old Man gets a look at his head which is
caked with mud and blood on one side

OLD MAN

He stands up shakily The Old Man gives Pete a hand

OLD MAN

CUT TO
EXT COMMERCE STREET - LAWSON CALIFORNIA - DAY

Pete and Stanton walk along Commerce Street the main drag
through the center of the small town Lawson is a bit run
down creeping inexorably toward decrepit Despite that

All-American feel

Several of the PEOPLE walking along the street take notice of
Pete and nod to Stanton who nods back

PETE

STANTON

black crepe Two boys no more than 18 and 19 who went off
to war and didnt come back

to wash it down with gulps of coffee

for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy He stops
in his tracks and starts chewing leisurely He smiles at

EXT COMMERCE STREET - DAY

A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s HARRY TRUMBO
shambles along the street headed for Mabels Diner Theres
a sadness about Harry the world-weary melancholy of a man
who has little to smile about because he has little to care
about After a couple of steps hes met up by DOC BEN
LARDNER a vigorous man in his 50s He comes up behind Harry
and claps him on the back

LARDNER

of snow-white hair He nods to Eldridge and Lardner and
slowly turns to face Pete He looks closer and closer
Hesitantly he takes a couple of steps towards Pete who
slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old mans gaze
Finally theyre standing practically toe-to-toe

PETE
looks a bit puzzled but the old man has such a sweet face
HARRY

has tears forming in his eyes A smile turns up the corners
of his mouth and quickly lights up his whole face

LARDNER

INT ELDRIDGES CAR (DRIVING) - DAY
Harry sits next to the Sheriff and Luke has the back seat

all to himself He leans forward toward the front seat and
taps Harry on the shoulder

LUKE
Excuse me whats your um your
name

HARRY

Harry son Harry

LUKE
And whats my name again

HARRY
Albert Lucas Trumbo But youve
been Luke since you were a baby

LUKE
Ah
(taking it for a spin)
Luke Luke I like it

Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street
HIS POV

Shops are open for business TOWNSPEOPLE are going about
their lives A few stop and watch as the Sheriffs car goes
by

LUKE
How long have I been gone

Eldridge looks at Harry who stares ahead

LUKE
How long

Pause The silence is too thick and Harry has to answer
He turns around in his seat and faces Luke

HARRY
(gently)
You never came back from the war
We were told you were missing and
presumed dead

LUKE
When did I leave

HARRY
You joined up one month to the day
after Pearl Harbor January
seventh nineteen forty-two

Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in

HARRY
Nine and-a-half years ago

LUKE
Nine and-a-half years

ELDRIDGE
Comin up on the Bijou gents
EXT IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAY
Eldridges car rounds the corner pulls up and stops

ELDRIDGE
Here we are

HARRY
Well son youre home

Luke peers across the street his mouth gapes open
HIS POV - THE BIJOU

The Bijou is a decaying Dada-esque grab-bag of building
styles Its as though the architect took random parts of a
Chinese temple a Mosque a Pagoda a Sphinx a symphony hall
and a slaughterhouse put them in a bag gave it a good
shake tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly
built the result

As a matter of fact if you didnt know that the place was
The Bijou youd probably wonder what the cryptic message

HE B J U
was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet

And now the reason for the deteriorated state of the HE B
J U sign becomes apparent Train tracks run right behind
the building on an elevated trestle As we watch a TRAIN
ROARS BY Everything shakes Its not an earthquake its a
trainquake The J teeters at a jaunty angle threatening
to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers

LUKE

stares at the monstrosity His face is ashen His heart has
sunk to somewhere below his knees

The Bijou
Harry jumps out of the car excitedly

HARRY
Thanks for the lift Cecil

ELDRIDGE
Dont mention it Welcome home

Luke

LUKE
(faint smile)
Thanks

Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out Harry grabs
his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket

HARRY
Waitll you see the inside

LUKE
(deadpan)
Cant wait

CUT TO
INT BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by
the exterior Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in
shards and pieces from the walls Its sort of a cross
between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum served up with
generous helpings of dust and grime an almost unbeatable
combination of questionable taste and neglect

Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --
probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole
theater --

A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER

Even under a veneer of dust the fragile droplets of cut
crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and
scatter it in a hundred directions

TILT DOWN TO REVEAL

Luke and Harry standing below Luke is lost in a gulf
somewhere between surprise and disgust

HARRY
Weve been closed for a while

LUKE

(smiling wanly)
Ah

Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly cracks one
open

INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem
to be for the most part intact -- although the occasional
row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved
itself up against the row behind or in front

THE SCREEN

is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin
framed by ragged red velveteen drapery

In the tiny orchestra pit as we will see later is an old
upright piano

Luke walks a few steps down the aisle He picks a seat on
the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits As he
does a CAT an orange tabby leaps out from under another
seat jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and
backstage Harry comes over and sits behind him

LUKE
(turning to Harry)
Exactly how long has the Bijou been
closed

HARRY
Hmmmm after you left it was
difficult and then Lily -- thats
your mother -- she took ill and
died we havent shown a picture
since forty-eight

LUKE
Why

HARRY

(deep breath)
Well after the war with so many
of the towns boys killed people
around here didnt much feel like
going to the movies I guess Some
of em moved away -- Los Angeles
Sacramento San Francisco Wasnt
much to keep em here I expect
And now with this television
thing -- people just arent going
out as much as they used to

LUKE
Didnt you have any help

HARRY
Oh I had Irene and Old Tim but
they really couldnt help much
Broke their hearts when we closed
up Broke mine too

(brightening)
But now that youre back well
things will be different around
here thats for sure

(rises grabs Lukes arm)
Cmon Ill show you where we live

INT BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY

The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a
contrast to the rest of the theater Its neat as a pin and
fairly lit as Harry has just pulled back the curtains
allowing the sun to flood the room

A beam of golden light falls across a table atop which are
SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS

One of the photos is of the real much-younger Luke Its a
Norman Rockwell scene at a train depot with an army-issue
olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder He has one
arm around Harry and the other around his mother

(And by the way Petes resemblance to the real Luke -- even
in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling)
HARRY

The day you shipped out That was
a proud day for your mother and me
Last time you saw her Last time I
saw you

He smiles

HARRY
Till today

Luke sets it down and picks up another photo that of a fine
looking woman Its a formal portrait dating perhaps from
the 30s

HARRY
Thats Lily Your mother rest her
soul

LUKE
(repeating)
Mother
(to Harry)
Shes beautiful

HARRY
(coming over)
Well yes that she was She
certainly made this place a home

He takes the picture from Luke kisses it and gently
replaces it on the table Luke goes over to the sofa and
sits

HARRY
(brightly)
Can I get you anything I can put
some coffee on or some

Harry looks at Luke who has almost instantly fallen asleep
on the sofa

He goes to him gently picks his feet off the floor lifts
them onto the sofa Removes his shoes sets them on the
floor

CUT TO

stands looks down warmly at his son Then suddenly hes
seized by a thought He turns and crosses to the window

CLOSE - THE WINDOW

Theres a small picture frame in the window Harry reaches
down gingerly picks it up and turns it around

ON THE FRAME
Its a single faded gold star One war casualty

Harry clutches it to his chest looks over at the sleeping
Luke and smiles

was dead Now I have my boy

clothes In the distance a train sounds its HORN

Luke rolls over on his back still asleep snoring lightly
Slowly he starts to wake up eyes still closed

Somethings strange though He frowns The train is
GETTING CLOSER Lukes eyes POP OPEN

LUKES POV

As the train RUMBLES BY shaking everything in the room Luke
looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him
Harry an elderly WOMAN and an elderly BLACK MAN

LUKE

HARRY
This is the staff of the Bijou

LUKE
Oh What what time is it

HARRY
Six-thirty I thought wed get an
early start

Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more
awake He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged
The elderly woman nudges Harry gently

HARRY
Oh Im sorry they know you but
you dont you need to be re-
introduced Luke this is Mrs
Irene Terwilliger

Luke stands and shakes MRS TERWILLIGERS hand Shes tiny
seventy if shes a day She smiles and curtsies slightly
Her eyes sparkle brightly her manner almost coquettish

MRS TERWILLIGER

You remember Luke dont you

OLT TIM is -- well old His clothes are a tad shabby but
well maintained though they hang loosely on his gangly
frame He wears an old blue knit cap which he quickly
removes as he shakes Lukes hand Hes a man of few words
his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles

LUKE
Is there a young Tim

OLD TIM

Well I was meaning to get a new

Luke looks at Old Tim then at Harry

HARRY
(to Luke)
I promised him a new uniform when

(to Old Tim)
And youll get one too

adjusts the focus on the beam of light The others look on

HARRY
Forty-two was a lean year around
here The war had just started
you were gone less than a month
and we were coming off a bit of a
drought as I recall Not everyone
could ante up the price of a
ticket and a chickens as good as
money if you ask me At that time
it meant a lot to the folks around
here to be able to come to the
pictures

LUKE
Yeah I know but poultry

HARRY

(rhapsodically)
I know its hard to believe son
but this place this little place
this wasnt a theater then this
was a palace Any man woman
child you me it didnt matter
you bought your ticket and you
walked in and you

Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs

HARRY
you were in a palace It was
like a dream It was like heaven
like you died and went to a palace
in heaven thats what it was like
And spotless too

safe Maybe it was just an escape
from reality but oh god it
was beautiful

They were like gods

to the screen

HARRY

And that was the altar Would
you remember if I told you we felt
lucky to be here to have the
privilege of watching them

(sadly)
This television thing Why would
you want to sit at home and watch a
little box with a little screen
Because its convenient Because
you dont have to get dressed and
put on a coat and a tie and a hat

Because you can just sit there
How can you call that
entertainment all alone in your

living room Where are the other
people Wheres the audience

but
Harry comes over to Luke

HARRY

Wheres the magic

He stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear

The trick is to see it

Slowly the muslin is drawn off revealing A STATUE OF A
KNEELING SOLIDER praying before a soldiers grave We
slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue

INT CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

ADELE (0S)
When we were kids my Dad was
mayor and you and me and a bunch
of others used to come down here
all the time

ON ADELE AND LUKE

looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage
room lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the
window The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet

ADELE
Of course there was a lot more
room before they stuck the memorial
down here

LUKE
(looks at the door)
Howd they get it inside

ADELE
Through the door It comes apart

She moves to the memorial Squinting she examines its base

ADELE
Your names on here See

Luke comes over
ON THE BASE OF THE MEMORIAL -- LUKES NAME

ADELE
Right here Albert Lucas Trumbo
And all the others I knew them
all So did you We went to
school with most of them

LUKE
It doesnt seem right this being
down here It ought to be where
people can see it

ADELE
After they commissioned it no one
could ever agree on where to put
it The Methodists wanted it in
front of the Methodist Church the
Presbyterians wanted it in front of
the Presbyterian Church the city
council wanted it in the lobby of
City Hall Everyone finally got
tired of the fighting So they
stuck it down here

He looks at her for a long moment Theres an electricity
between them and they both feel it

LUKE
So youre really gonna be a
lawyer

ADELE

(suddenly defensive)
And why not

LUKE
Whoa
ADELE
(smiling)
Sorry You dont know how many

LUKE
Have you always wanted to be a
lawyer

ADELE
You dont remember but yes

ADELE
(gently)

Oh well I guess you in high

first baseman And we were on the
debate team together But I
think you were gonna run the Bijou
You were brought up there and you
loved it so much And I think you

place like that

He turns away rubs his head
LUKE
I just wish I could remember some

of this

He turns back to her

LUKE
You dont have a boyfriend or
anyone you know like that
ADELE
Actually I was married For four
years But well we didnt fit

LUKE

ADELE
No its okay See when two
people belong together the other
person should be the the key
that unlocks the rest of you Im
not making sense am I

LUKE
(moving toward her)

No you are I know exactly what
you mean Its not that youre
missing something Its that the
other person gives something to
you that you had all the time

the hiccups again

LUKE

Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision to
not struggle against the hiccups She has them and thats
just the way it is

LUKE
Were we going to get married

ADELE
Eventually We were going to be
(hic) engaged when you came

back from (hic) overseas

He looks at her Shes strikingly beautiful at this
particular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups and
all He moves closer to her She moves closer to him

ADELE
(breathless)
but you had to go serve
(hic) your country

They kiss passionately She reaches up and puts her arms
around him He starts kissing her neck and she suddenly
realizes -- shes stopped hiccuping

ADELE
Hey it worked

And as she smiles and kisses him again we
DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE BIJOU - NIGHT

Luke comes down the street and heads for the front door He
has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys
and enters

INT BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Its very dark Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door
when he looks down and sees

THE ORANGE TABBY CAT

shoot into the lobby stopping in the middle of the floor
It looks at Luke and PURRS

Luke closes the door and moves to the cat He crouches down
and pets it and its back rises to meet his hand

LUKE
Hey fella So you live here too

that
The cat moves to the auditorium door pausing to look back at
Luke Curiosity piqued Luke follows the cat

INT BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

cans and a large beat-up cardboard standee of The Tramp
with the legend Chaplin Short To-Day

fq

The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door
at the end of a hallway Luke following the cat comes
around the same corner and looks at

THE DOOR
Slightly ajar theres a light coming from within as well as

the sound of Old Tim softly humming Its a Long Way to
Tipperary
Luke moves to the door and knocks

LUKE
Um Old Tim Sorry its late
Its Luke Can I come in

The humming stops and after a moment the door swings open
revealing Old Tim a pipe in his mouth holding the cat
stroking its fur

OLD TIM
Found me

LUKE
Yeah I hope you dont mind I

well besides Harry And me

Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow
him

INT OLD TIMS ROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot
which is perfectly made military-style

OLD TIM
Not used to visitors
(gesturing)
Sit

Old Tim points to a ragged overstuffed easy chair next to
the kitchen area -- a sink dishes and utensils a tiny
icebox

Luke sits in the chair and Old Tim sits on the cot facing
him Silence Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau

ON THE PHOTO

Its a much younger Old Tim looking quite serious and
handsome in his Great War doughboys uniform

The cat jumps down from Old Tims arms and moves to Luke He
rubs against his legs purring Luke leans down to pet him

LUKE
So I guess this fellow belongs to
you Whats his name

OLD TIM
Cat
LUKE
Cat Thats simple I like it
(pets Cat)
Hi Cat

OLD TIM

We thought you was dead you know
(another new thought)
Its okay that I live here

LUKE
Of course

Pause then suddenly
OLD TIM
Do you think Ill get me a new u-u

uniform

Luke looks up at the old man who stammers when he speaks
more than a couple of words

LUKE
Ill do everything I can

Old Tim puffs on his pipe strangely detached

OLD TIM
T-t-thank you Thank you I I

Luke is sitting at the desk making notes and adding up some
figures He puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes then
looks up at

HARRY AND OLD TIM

who are sitting on the floor going through piles of lobby
cards and folded one-sheets like little boys fascinated with
their baseball cards

He shifts his gaze to
MRS TERWILLIGER

who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or
three file cabinets in the corner of the office As she
works she hums an old song occasionally breaking into the
lyrics

MRS TERWILLIGER
(sings)
The object of my affection Can
change my complexion From white to
rosy red

Luke takes a breath

LUKE
Well

HARRY
Yes

LUKE

Between a new screen paint
plumbing for the concession stand
and about a hundred other repairs
around the theater its going to
cost at least nine hundred dollars
to get the Bijou into shape to open

MRS TERWILLIGER
Oh my

Nine hundred

LUKE

Its tiny with rounded corners black-and-white anda
hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow

WIDER

INT LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television
set trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of Your Show
of Shows He adjusts the dials fiddles with the rabbit
ears steps back -- and is successful SID CAESAR And
IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch
and Lardner fairly roars with laughter

He turns to go back to his chair but the second he does so
the reception goes haywire He returns to the spot in front
of the TV and the picture is perfect again

The DOORBELL RINGS Hes torn -- if he moves the picture
will break up The doorbell RINGS again and we HEAR Adeles
voice from upstairs

ADELE (0S)
Daddy thats Luke can you let him
in Ill be right down

LARDNER
Honey I I cant its the

Theres a KNOCK at the door
LARDNER

(giving in)
Oh hell

He moves from his spot The reception goes bad and he
marches to the door

He opens it and Luke is standing there wearing a slightly
out-of-date coat and tie

LARDNER
Evening Luke

LUKE
Evening Doctor Lardner

Lardner freezes staring at Luke

LUKE
Whats wrong

LARDNER
(shaken from his reverie)
Uh no just seeing you standing
there it reminded me theres a

word for it

LUKE
Oh you mean the suit Harry kept
all my old clothes Fits okay but
its a little big

Adele comes down the stairs Halfway down she stops
suddenly and stares at Luke

ADELE
Oh

Awkward pause Adeles staring at Luke Lardners staring at
Luke and Lukes getting nervous

LUKE
I shouldnt have worn the suit

Adele comes down the stairs

ADELE
No you were wearing that suit
the last time we went out before

LUKE
Oh

ADELE

LARDNER
Thats it Deja vu

Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other
Lardner breaks it

LARDNER
You kids off to the dance

LUKE
Arent you coming

LARDNER
No Im not much of a dancer

ADELE
(chidingly)
Besides Daddys still trying to
figure out how to get his new
television set working

LARDNER
I had it a minute ago
He glances at the TV set The picture is suddenly crystal
clear

LARDNER
ooooh Its back
(encouraging them toward
the door)
Well you kids have fun now

Adele takes Lukes arm and they exit exchanging goodnights
with Lardner who closes the door and turns toward the living
room

S-l-o-w-l-y he sneaks into the room watching the TV
carefully all the while The reception is staying perfect
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business
and Lardner wants to laugh but hes afraid to He stifles
his urge and heads for his chair Gingerly he sits Still
perfect

Satisfied he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up
The picture goes completely haywire again

LARDNER
Aw crap

EXT STREET - NIGHT
Adele and Luke walk along arm-in-arm

ADELE
This is strange Do you feel it

LUKE

ADELE
Weve done this before so many
times The last time was so long

ago but it feels like yesterday

LUKE
Oh

Pause

ADELE
You know everyones so excited
about the Bijou re-opening

LUKE
(interrupting)
Its gonna cost over nine hundred
dollars to open the place Delly

ADELE
(shocked)
Nine hundred

LUKE
Yeah and needless to say none of
us has that kind of money lying
around

ADELE
What about a loan You could go to
the bank

LUKE
A loan to a man who ran his
business into the ground and his
son who cant account for the last
nine-and-a-half years of his life
Not likely

ADELE
Well theres got to be a way

LUKE
(suddenly)
Have you got a cigarette

Adele stops

ADELE
When did you start smoking

LUKE
I dont smoke

ADELE
You tried to once It was pretty
pitiful

LUKE

Adele glances curiously at Luke as we

A CLARINET

launching into the opening bars of Dont Be That Way an
old Benny Goodman tune
EXT CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY

Spencer Wyatts big ban is comprised of a dozen or so
MUSICIANS about Spencers age -- except for the drummer
AVERY WYATT 40s Spencers dad Though no Gene Krupa he
pounds the skins pretty well all the while smiling proudly
as his son plays clarinet and leads the band

Despite the last minute decorations the Square looks nice
hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights

ON LUKE AND ADELE
dancing to the music along with several other COUPLES

LUKE
(nodding toward the band)
Theyre not bad

ADELE
No theyre not Id say your
investment was paying dividends

LUKE
My what

ADELE
Back in 37 you heard Benny
Goodman play for the first time so
you went out and got a used
clarinet You wanted nothing more
than to be able to play like him
You tried hard but it wasnt long
before it was clear that Benny
Goodman would never be looking over
his shoulder So you gave the
clarinet to Spencer

LUKE
Huh That was nice of me

ADELE
You had a hidden agenda though
See when he was five or six
little Spence used to follow you
around like a puppy Bothered the
hell out of you But as soon as
you gave him the clarinet

LUKE
he started practicing and he
left me alone from then on

ADELE
Exactly And he got good

LUKE
No kidding

They dance a bit

ADELE
Now did you remember that or

LUKE
Nope Just filling in the blanks

ADELE
Oh Okay

LUKE

Luke dances Adele away a slightly nonplussed expression on
her face The band finishes the song and everyone
enthusiastically APPLAUDS Spencer bows shyly
slightly He nods to the band and they bow before he

motions for the crowds attention

SPENCER
(nervously)
Thanks folks Gee can you tell

The crowd yells No You guys sound great

SPENCER

Well this is our first time and
its really all because of Luke I
mean its because of Luke coming
back that were here tonight -- but

He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees

Luke

SPENCER

(to Luke)
When you didnt come back I
learned how to play this so I could
remember you And now that youre
back well Ill never forget you

(to the crowd)
Luke gave me this clarinet but he
gave this night to all of us

The crowd APPLAUDS warmly

SPENCER
Okay folks heres Mayor Cole

The crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser

turns and addresses Avery Wyatt on drums

He
ERNIE
Pretty proud of your boy Avery

Avery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six
times to register his reaction

ON THE KICK DRUM -- WYATTS HARDWARE LAWSON CALIF

ERNIE
Looks like you might have to find
someone else to mix paint at the
store cause I think Spencers got
a big career ahead of him

APPLAUSE again and Ernie waits for it to settle As soon as
he starts speaking the crowd becomes totally silent

ERNIE
You know folks here in Lawson we
gave a lot for our country A lot
And we never complained and we
never faltered And we never
forgot

Ernies voice cracks slightly with emotion He clears his
throat and continues

ERNIE
We never forgot And so when one
of our own came back to us I gotta
tell you folks it was like a
miracle Luke seein you walking
down the street it was well it
was kinda like seein one of my
boys alive again I think I speak
for everyone here when I say that
not a day goes by when we dont
keep our boys memories alive But
Luke having you back among us
well it helps us keep their
spirits alive too God bless you
son

The crowd APPLAUDS Adele takes Lukes hand and smiles
Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject

ERNIE

All right enough athat This is

good time -- but not too good a
time cause I see just about every
member of the city council here

Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a

FITTS

LUKE
(its an alien word)
A super market Huh

FITTS

Fitts takes Lukes hand and shakes it

FITTS
Good to have you back Luke

As Luke watches Fitts walk off we

Moonlight Serenade slow and easy

ON ADELE AND LUKE

As they hold each other close and dance Adele rests her
head on Lukes shoulder her eyes closed Luke strokes her
hair and sways her gently to the music

Luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor

LUKES POV

Bob Leffert is standing there staring at the band Mabel
comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder Shes

Luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door He
pulls out his keys and enters

INT BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
Lukes about to close the door when he looks down and sees
CAT

MEOWING at him from the sidewalk He holds the door open
and Cat shoots into the lobby disappearing into the

auditorium Luke closes the door and stops He HEARS
something and so do we Soft and faraway its a PIANO
The melody is soft lilting -- almost a lullaby

Luke turns toward the music which is coming from the
auditorium The piano continues building slightly in
volume He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively
pushes one open

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Luke enters his face bathed in the soft flickering
reflected light of

THE SCREEN
The movie is The Big Parade The old decomposing nitrate
print is badly scratched and stained A young beautiful
Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover John
Gilbert as he marches off to fight the Great War

Luke stares at the screen The look on his face is one of
bewilderment -- and awe

ANGLE - THE PIANO

The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out-
of-tune But it really doesnt matter

CLOSER

Mrs Terwilliger is playing passionately She never takes
her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered

filling the frame Were looking directly into the beam of
light radiating from the projector

PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT we get closer to the windows of the
booth We come out of the beam and can just barely make out
the figure of Harry framed in a small window next to the
projector

WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harrys
face fills the screen He is watching the film his eyes are
wide and moist as though hes experiencing the magic thats
unfolding on the screen for the very first time

The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES
signaling the end of the reel Harry moves away from the
window

INT PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Never taking his eyes off the screen Harry watches as the
film comes to an end and flap falp falps out of the
projector He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs
apart and the bright beam dies Its not the end of the
movie but it is the end of the only fragment they have

Harry moves to the house lights rheostat and slowly fades
them up This done he pulls a handkerchief from his back
pocket and blows his nose loudly

He crosses back to the projector unlatches the full take-up
reel and takes it down Hes about to move away when he
senses that hes not alone He looks over the projector to
see

something -- both men search for words Suddenly Luke feels
very out-of-place almost embarrassed -- as though hes
interrupted a very private ritual

tightly to his chest he searches Lukes face and smiles
warmly

HARRY

of the film onto an empty reel Slowly he begins to turn
the crank rewinding the film

He stops and looks to where Luke was standing but hes not

Fitts leans forward

FITTS

place up after all

LUKE

Mr Fitts with all due respect I
think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit
more than it needs a super market
And I think Lawson deserves the
Bijou Theres not a lot that can
be done to help us get past the
pain weve all felt

He looks at Harry and smiles
LUKE

EXT SHERIFFS STATION - DAY

Pete comes out into the bright midday sun It takes a moment
for his eyes to adjust and when they do he becomes aware of
perhaps TWENTY PEOPLE lining the sidewalk in front of the
station

PETES POV

We recognize several of the people Carl Leffert Bob
Leffert and Mabel Lanier Daley Thornhill Katie
Rutherford Stanton Lawson Now theres nothing in the
least bit threatening about the gathering -- and thats
whats so disturbing about it Theyre not an angry mob
theyre just standing there running the gamut of emotions
Shock Disillusionment Betrayal

Its an awkward moment Pete doesnt quite know how to
react He wants to go over and talk to them but he wouldnt
know what to say He wishes one of them would talk to him
just say something anything But no one does

Then Bob Leffert turns away from Pete He shoves his hook
hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away followed by
Mabel then his brother then the others

leaving Pete alone

Mrs Terwilliger behind the candy counter wipes up an
imaginary spill a full wheel of unsold tickets by her elbow

Pete anxiously paces the lobby He looks into
THE AUDITORIUM
Every seat is empty

He glances at his watch then turns to Old Tim and Mrs

ADELE

if you were a communist

PETE

Come on Delly look at the country

Russians weve got this thing with
the Rosenbergs and the atomic
bomb

(bitterly)
You think they want suspected
communists entertaining the
American public with party
propaganda like gosh I dont know
Sand Pirates of the Sahara

ADELE
Forget about all that You want to
do the right thing Then defend
your name If someone says
something about you thats untrue

quiet as gas station owner RORY late 60s pulls up and parks
his Model A truck He gets out and an big old German
Shepherd LOTTIE jumps out of the truck bed

Rory moves to the door and is about to put his key in the
lock when Lottie starts whining looking toward the fog bank
and sniffing the air expectantly

RORY

He stops -- he hears something too -- a LOW RUMBLE Lottie
starts BARKING The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER Rorys
getting worried He looks at

THE FOG BANK

Its starting to GLOW from within Lotties barking gets
LOUDER and angrier Suddenly a large black car punches out
of the fog bank and tears down the road Its followed by
another

trucks all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town

Rory moves toward Lottie

the radiator behind him The silence in the room is thick

Across the desk from Pete sits Leo Kubelsky

LEO
The FBI cant arrest you because
you havent done anything wrong

PETE
Well thats a relief I
understand they usually dont let
that stop them

LEO
However youre gonna be
subpoenaed to testify before the
Un-American Activities Committee
when they open hearings in Los
Angeles Now if you play ball and
tell them what they want to hear
theyll clear you

PETE
And I wont be a communist anymore

LEO

PETE
So it doesnt make any difference
that Im not one now and have
never been one

Leo stands and walks to the window

LEO
Kid dont get philosophical with
me This is a game but its not
your game You play by their
rules or theyll ruin you And
they have the power to do it

ADELE
Doesnt it bother anyone that this
is a perversion of democracy

Leo turns to her and smiles His tone is charmingly matter-
of-factly not condescending in the least

LEO
Darling dont kid yourself We
dont have a democracy in this
country The Declaration of
Independence The Constitution
These are pieces of paper with
signatures on em And you know
what a piece of paper with a
signature is Its a contract
And you know what a contract is
Something that can be re-negotiated
at any time It just so happens
that the House Un-American
Activities Committee is re-
negotiating the contract this time
around

Leo takes out a cigarette lights it

LEO
Next time it might be the FBI
The time after that it might be
the President But itll always be

PETE
Thats not the country Luke fought
for

LEO

Lest we forget Peter your own
military career was somewhat less
illustrious than Lukes

Leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to
Pete

people for their own purposes
Sometimes it makes mistakes

end the law prevails for the just
Sometimes it takes a while

Mr Appleton do you know an
Albert Lucas Trumbo

PETE
Luke Trumbo We never met But

around I wasnt masquerading
Luke Trumbo Luke was a good man
who gave his life for his country
I just happen to look a little

Well Id direct the attention of
counsel and committee to line
thirty-six of the document and the
name printed and signed there

We see it For the record it
reads Lucille Angstrom Whats
the point of this

PETE
Well thats what I knew then Or
who I knew I should say You see
I was trying to court Miss
Angstrom I went to the meeting to
impress her

CLYDE
(grinning)
Are you asking this committee to
believe that you attended a meeting
of a communist party front
organization in order to impress a
girl

PETE
(slyly)
Well if youd seen Miss
Angstrom

The audience LAUGHS Doyle BANGS his gavel

PETE
You asked for the truth Thats
the truth I had no idea what the
meeting was about I just sat
through it so I could be near her
Im sure even a Majority Counsel
like yourself is familiar with the
concept of impressing a girl

The audience LAUGHS Clyde shoots a look at Doyle who BANGS
his gavel

DOYLE
Chamber will come to order

Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete

CLYDE
All right Mr Appleton That was
what you knew then What do you
know now

Well I know that I lost my job

when I was a kid in college I
know that Ive been branded a
communist which Im not but even
if I was it shouldnt matter or
what do we have a Bill Of Rights
for

non-responsive

consider my true friends feel
betrayed by me not because of who
and what I am but because of what
you say I am I know that I

falls quiet

DOYLE

(emphatically)
Mr Appleton you will respond to

speechmaking or the chair will
find you in Contempt Of Congress
You will not be warned again is
that clear

then)
Continue Mr Clyde

Mr Appleton

Clyde takes a long pause for effect then looks up at Pete
CLYDE
Are you now or have you ever been

a member of the communist party

PETE
No sir

CLYDE
(holding up the roster)
Are you refuting this evidence and
your previous testimony

PETE
Im not refuting anything

CLYDE

Yet youre contradicting yourself
You earlier testified that you
attended a meeting of a communist
party-run organization yet you
just said under oath that you
were not now -- nor ever -- a
member of the communist party

PETE
Thats not a contradiction at all
sir I went to the meeting but I
didnt go as a member

CLYDE
Well then as what did you go

Beat Pete smiles

PETE
Im a little hesitant to say

DOYLE
The witness need not be hesitant to
say anything before this committee
as long as its the truth

(matter-of-factly)
Im sorry sir I have no intention
of making light of this committee
And I have no intention of
incurring your wrath Mr Chairman
I have a few friends who have
already incurred your wrath
Theyve sent me letters from jail

CLYDE
(interrupting)
Mr Chairman Mr Chairman the
witness is making another speech
I would ask that Mr Appleton be
admonished

DOYLE

(indifferent)
Mr Appleton there is no question
before you at this time but Im

prepared and if youd like to
either answer them or plead the
Fifth Amendment we can at least
get on with the business of this
committee

bit and is splashes onto his coat As some of the
spectators chuckle Pete brushes the water off He reaches
into his pocket and pulls out Adeles copy of the
constitution The cover is wet He wipes it off and sets it
down on the table

He takes a sip of water Looks at the book Picks it up

Petes terrified but in control He speaks slowly -- hes
making this up and thinking it out as he goes

PETE
Mr Chairman theres another
Amendment that Id like to
invoke at this time but its not
the Fifth Amendment I wonder if
youre familiar with it

DOYLE
Mr Appleton you will

He opens the book and reads tentatively at first

PETE
Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof or abridging the
freedom of speech or of the press
or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble and to
petition the Government for a
redress of grievances

EXT PETES APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The limo pulls up and Leo opens the door Pete vacantly
grabs his suitcase and gets out Leo shuts the door and
calls after him waving Petes hat

LEO

Pete comes back and takes his hat Leo grabs his hand

LEO

As the limo pulls away we
CUT TO
INT PETES APARTMENT (LA) - DAY

The door opens revealing the Super followed by a sullen

Pete carrying his suitcases and hat He sets them down and
goes to the coffee table where his boxes of belongings from
the studio have been gathering dust these last three months

SUPER
(handing him a key)
Heres a new key for ya That Mr
Kubelsky hes got you paid up
through this month You got one
swell friend there

The Super moves to the door and turns back
SUPER
Good to have you back Pete

He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out
the tin-toy fire truck Distractedly Pete puts the toy back
in the box and replies too late

PETE
Thanks

He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat As he
does Adeles copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat
pocket and falls open to the floor

Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the
inscription inside the front cover catches his eye

TO DELLY
THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS
LOVE LUKE

Pete closes the book He thinks for a moment then glances
over at the phone He picks it up and dials 0

PETE
Western Union please

EXT TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

Our view of the moving train is from outside as it speeds up
the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara Looking
into one of the trains windows we SEE Pete sitting staring
out at the passing scenery

PETES NARRATION (VO)

DISSOLVE TO

EXT LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON

The train is just pulling in to Lawson As it SHUDDERS to a
halt the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete
steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open

HIS POV
The ENTIRE TOWN has turned out Theyre all there smiling
broadly A large hand-lettered banner reads

WELCOME HOME PETE
LAWSONS FAVORITE SON

A CHEER goes up from the crowd breaking the silence Pete
descends from the train and moves into the throng The first
two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier
bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it both smiling
as they shake hands vigorously

BOB
Luke um I mean Pete if it
werent for you I wouldnt have
had the nerve to ask this fine
woman to marry me

Mabels mouth drops open

PETE
Bob congratulations Whend you
ask her
MABEL
Holy moley Just now
(to Bob)

Yes Bob Yes

As Mabel kisses Bob for all shes worth Pete continues into
the crowd where hes kissed embraced patted on the back

ADELE

is at the back of the crowd working her way to the front
She rushes into Petes arms and they kiss Another CHEER
goes up

PETE

ADELE

They kiss again Pete pulls away and looks at his watch

PETE
(smiling)
Cmon Dell we gotta go Showtime
in fifteen minutes

The train whistle BLOWS as it slowly pulls out of the
station

PETES NARRATION (VO)
Happily ever after is a relative
term folks My world is much
smaller now and my dreams are very
different than they were But I
have something now that I never had
before I have the magic And
its for sale at the Bijou every
day of the year All you need is
the price of a ticket

We BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and being
enveloped by the crowd

Spencer Wyatts band is assembled in front of the depot
office and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we
move up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the
town settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijous
marquee The neon chaser lights POP ON illuminating the
sign which reads

THE END

Then the letters on the marquee START SHAKING We BOOM UP
TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER and the BIJOU sign

as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater
and the J teeters loose and swings by a thread
and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND

CUT TO BLACK
