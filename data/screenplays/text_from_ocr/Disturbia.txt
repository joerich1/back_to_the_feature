OVER BLACK

KALE (VO)
(tense)
Do you think he sees us

JEFF (VO)
No he cant see us But he feels
us watching
FADE IN

DEEP BLUE WATER FILLS THE FRAME

And there a few feet beneath the surface something
SHIMMERS in the sunlight As ripples dissipate we make out
the shape of a bright yellow CRANKBAIT waiting patiently for
its prey on the end of a 10-pound line

We hold on this for another silent beat then -- a huge
BLACK BASS suddenly swoops into frame circling the bait

ON KALE BRECHT AND HIS DAD JEFF BRECHT Both startle at the sight Kale a clean-cut all-American
kid reflexively yanks back on his rod and reel

KALE
Whoa did you see that thing

Kale anxiously winds the spool --

JEFF
Settle down slow it down
Jeff lightly puts his hand on Kales slowing the cranking
to a slight steady pull as we WIDEN TO REVEAL them standing
near the stern of their 16-foot BASSMASTER We are

1 EXT BISHOP LAKE - DAY

The undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as
we MOVE CLOSER to Kale and Jeff taking note of their t-
shirts Jeffs has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a
Bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its
fins Beneath it the slogan Weapons of Bass Destruction
The fish on Kales shirt wears a stock car uniform a single
word across the bottom BASSCAR

As Jeff steadies Kales hand and pulls away

JEFF
You dont want to scare him off
Youve got his attention now just
play with him Tease hima little

DJ
Caruso

Kale and Jeff watch the water in anxious silence Kale

inching the line back toward the boat One more crank then --

The BLACK BASS suddenly ATTACKS THE LURE with a tremendous
SLOSH OF HIS TAIL

KALE
Holy shit

JEFF
Its all you Kale keep cranking

Kale cranks fast and furious But this is one fish thats
going down fighting

KALE
I need reinforcements

Jeff moves in grabs the rod and reel from behind Kale

JEFF
Heave laddie
They PULL The rod curls under the weight

JEFF (CONTD)
(pirate accent)
Give it all ya got mate or youre
gonna lose him

KALE
(laughing pulling
struggling)
Dad your pirate -- impersonation --
sucks
JEFF

How would ya know have ya ever met
one I doubt it --

The BASS SLOSHES FURIOUSLY around the bait now just a few
feet from the boat

KALE
Hes freakin pulling us in

JEFF
(laughing)
Never No Brecht has ever -- lost a
fight -- to a fish

The BASS suddenly snaps free The line goes limp Jeff and
Kale lose their balance nearly falling backward Then --

DJ

Caruso

1 All becomes silent save for Jeff and Kales heavy breathing
Kale winds the empty line back to the boat shoots a glance
to Jeff then throws the rod aside in mock disgust Jeff
takes a seat in the captains chair

JEFF (CONTD)
Throw me a --

Kale is already in the cooler He throws Jeff a Coke Both
sit in silence for a beat Then --
JEFF (CONTD)
Hey at least the weathers great
were spending quality time together

KALE
(grabbing pole)
That fish is going down

JEFF
(not missing a beat)
Lets nab the bastard

They both cast their lines --

2 EXT HIGHWAY 395 - NORTHERN SIERRA MOUNTAINS - EVENING

An amber glow sets the mountainside ablaze as Jeffs SUV
winds through the serpentine pass

3 INT SUV - EVENING - CONTINUOUS - MOVING

Jeff drives Kales on his cell

KALE (contd)
(into phone as needed)
Hey mom its us Listen fire up
the grill cause the Bassmasters are
headed home

Jeff slaps Kale five as he veers the SUV into the left lane
passing a slow-moving PATHFINDER

INTERCUT

Julie smiles Jeff grabs the phone from Kale

JEFF
(into phone as needed)
Were having fish for a week

Kale smiles as a LINCOLN NAVIGATOR PICK-UP zooms past in the
right lane swerves back in the left lane in front of them

JEFF (CONTD)
(over the above)

Id say an hour Love you too

Jeff flips the phone shut tosses it to Kale They exchange
smiles A silent moment passes They both turn to face the
road as --

THE NAVIGATOR PICK-UP
suddenly SWERVES back into the right lane revealing a

STALLED MINI-VAN
directly in front of them

KALE
DAD --

Jeff instinctively reaches his arm in front of Kale as he
SWINGS the wheel hard right and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES But
its not in time The

SUV

clips the mini-vans right rear bumper SMASHING it into the
left lane concrete barricade The SUV spins into the right
lane where that

SLOW-MOVING PATHFINDER

suddenly BROADSIDES IT with such FORCE that it FLIPS the SUV
up and over It TUMBLES off the highway barreling into

EXT VACANT CLIFFSIDE PULLOFFVIEWING AREA - EVENING - CONT
A couple of final METAL-CRUNCHING FLIPS send the SUVs
undercarriage CRASHING to a violent stop on top of a rickety
wood beam-mounted GUARDRAIL

A silent beat Then -- steam billows from the hood

Airbags deflate Dust settles Blood streams from Jeffs
hairline His eyes flutter open

Caruso

He looks up to Kale strapped in the passenger seat
unconscious A small gash on his forehead We only see
blue sky through Kales shattered passenger window

JEFF
Kale -- Kale are you okay
Kale opens his eyes Jeff reaches up touches Kales face
KALE
I think so
Kale looks down at his dad -- his eyes widen in horror not

only at the sight of Jeff but of the ravine beneath them --
For this brief moment we may have thought the SUV was stable
But we CRANE BACK UP AND OUT KALES PASSENGER WINDOW to REVEAL

A MUCH GRIMMER REALITY the SUV is PERCHED LENGTHWISE ON TOP
OF THE GUARDRAIL AT A 45-DEGREE DOWNWARD ANGLE

The SUVs right front and rear tires precariously grip the
rail keeping it from plunging 500 feet to the RAVINE below

7 BACK INSIDE THE SUV
KALE
Oh my God dad --

-- Jeffs leg is trapped beneath the crumpled dashboard
JEFF
Im fine But youre gonna have to
climb out Kale Can you do that

Kales hands shake from the SHOCK as his fingers search for
the seatbelt buckle But the shoulder strap is LOCKED IN
PLACE preventing Kale from turning He tugs it furiously

KALE
I cant -- It wont give --
JEFF
Thats okay Ive got it -- grab the

door I dont need your ass falling
on my face --

Kale reaches up grips the outside of the door as

JEFFS HAND

shakily reaches to Kales seatbelt buckle and presses Kales
belt SNAPS LOOSE Kales body DROPS but he hangs on to the
window -- just as a

out the window

9 OUTSIDE THE SUV - KALE

slowly slides down the outside of the door then turns around
on his chest reaches his hand back down to Jeff --

KALE
Dad here --
Jeff reaches up as a
SECTION OF GUARDRAIL RIVETS

a few inches behind the SUVs rear bumper suddenly POP LOOSE
THE GUARDRAIL SNAPS IN TWO

KALE SCREAMS hangs on for dear life as the GUARDRAIL and
SUV SWING OUT AND OVER THE RAVINE

The guardrail is buckling fast Another beam RIPS FREE of
its foundation -- Kale slides a few more inches down the
door and right front fender allowing

HIS FEET

to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath Having
at least some footing Kale reaches back inside --

KALE (CONTD)
Dad please you can do it --

Jeff unbuckles his belt and reaches up Kale summons his
strength grabs Jeffs wrist pulls him up and through the
passenger window just as the

SUV FALLS AWAY

Jeffs weight pulls Kale down Kales feet SLIP off the

rail Kale SLAMS chest down his TORSO wrapping around the
top of the rail feet dangling But hes still clutching
Jeffs wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM
CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS

JEFFS WRIST
slips from Kales grasp Kale struggles to hang on but
hes losing the battle and the balancing act And he knows

it Tears well in Kales eyes

CU - Jeffs left hand enters frame clasps Kales Another
beat of eyes on eyes The guardrail continues to BUCKLE

Then -- Jeff starts to PRY KALES HAND AWAY --

Jeffs arm RELEASES FROM KALES GRIP Kale opens his mouth
to scream as a shrill bell RINGS

D

J

only one in the world who eats pizza-
flavored Pringles And you never
stuff the chips in you savor each
one by dividing it into four precise
bites I didnt know that was even
possible Youre also the first

girl Ive ever seen who spends more
time on her roof than in her own
house And what do you do out there
You dont talk on the phone you
dont paint your nails you read
books Now one would think with the
whole numbers thing youve got going
on that youd put them on your shelf
alphabetically but you dont Your
systems much more perfect The

ones you like go on the bottom the
ones you love go in the middle and
the ones you need the ones you keep
going back to well they go straight
to the top next to the dream
encyclopedia You know what all

this tells me You know how things
should be The world according to
Ashley And guess what Its a

very entertaining and beautiful
thing Even when it takes a hit
When you end up in a place like

this when your parents dump their
baggage on you or just when it
seems like those curveballs are never
gonna stop -- It sucks but just so
you know -- I get it
