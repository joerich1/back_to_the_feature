at

Itll be two quid

Evidently we have two quid

She beams with relief - throws her fur over her

diffused light throwing the room into delicate shadow

CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement

As certain events of possible interest are to take

in this room here

in detail

is what amazes Helen

The room is the product of three rooms which have been
knocked into one It is very large and extremely well
constructed (as we are soon to learn it was originally

laboratory) One half of the room is used for

and the other half for filming - and for trade shows

two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are

all shapes and sizes of cameras their spectacles

in the light

In the processing half two benches (a dry bench and a
wet bench) face each other against opposite walls

are three sinks above the

equipment above the

bench and an outburst

This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps

in the ceiling above the benches

The other part of the room has a window at the far end
it Heavy drapes are putted across it

Marks projector rests on a small table in front of the
lomm screen Two banks of floods and a variety of

light this part of the room There is a small control
on the wall

Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is
All of it glistens with the affection of its owner

There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone
except an adult the kind who starts to wonder who

for it all

watching Helen

She looks at him with renewed interest

HELEN

She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober The

nothing

that when he looks at grown-
ups without his camera he can still
see them as they were when they

it
MARK

MRS STEPHENS
How odd - that the light can spoil
anything
The screen greys out
In Mrs Stephens own dark-room we hear the hum of
Marks
projector - and the pounding of Marks heart - and
very

faintly the sounds of Tony bathing himself

her face only inches from the screen - the light from

switch

carefully gives it to her by the handle She grasps it
tightly

at the back of the room

HELEN
Shes right your mother must
tell someone everything sorry

has to be you

CLOSE SHOT of Helen standing in the shadows where her

stood
HELEN
This was his laboratory and you
know some of what he did but

not all
The room is suddenly filled with the terrified
of a small boy Helen wheels round The screaming seems
be coming from the walls Marks hand is on a switch -
of a number on a panel

MARK
aged five

He presses another switch There is a click and the
screaming stops to be replaced by a low sobbing

MARK
aged seven

He presses another switch There is a moments silence

MARK
All the rooms were wired for
sound and still are

WE SUDDENLY HEAR the ticking of a clock

MARK
Your room

CLOSE SHOT of Helen - listening

MARK
Your mothers

The click of a switch - and we hear a loud snoring

MARK
Tonys
The click of a switch - and we hear Tonys voice

TONY (0S)
No one will come in honestly
darling

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
I dont care

TONY
But darling

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
Stop it Tony

Mark listens with interest

HELEN
(quietly)
Turn it off

He does so - at once She walks towards him He turns
away
from her

HELEN
Look at me Mark

MARK
Not if youre frightened

HELEN

Look at me

Slowly he faces her

HELEN

What did you do to those girls
MARK

No
HELEN

What did you do Mark
He tries to turn away - but she follows him

HELEN
If you want to torment me for
the rest of my life then make
me imagine

CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his eyes closed

HELEN

What did you do to those girls
MARK

Cant
HELEN

Show me Mark

MARK
But if youre frightened

HELEN
Show me - or Ill remain
frightened for the rest of my

life Show me

He turns to his cine-camera and picks it up He
releases
the tripod

CAMERA HOLDS on Helen She stands very still against
the

wall Marks voice is overlaid

MARK (0S)

Do you know what the most
frightening thing in the world
is

She is looking at something puzzled

MARK
Its fear

The sound of his footsteps approaching

MARK
So I did something very simple

WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes

MARK
Very simple

WE SEE the spike approaching her throat but she is
looking at something else
size
magnifying
The

There

distorted

middle

of

her

MARK
When they felt the spike touching
their throats and knew I was
going to kill them
The spike is touching her throat
MARK
I made them - watch their own
deaths
CLOSE SHOT of Helens face several times its natural
She is looking at herself in a large circular
mirror which has been fitted over the cameras face

mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera

is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of
the camera winks As Helen looks at her terrified

face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the

of her forehead

MARK
Made them see their own terror as
the spike went in and if death

has a face they saw that too

CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror sweat
pouring down his forehead his finger on the trigger

the camera

MARK
Not you Not you Ill never
photograph you I promised - I
promised - Not you

Helens eyes are closed The spike is still touching
throat

CLOSE SHOT of Mark — his face turned away from the
viewfinder

HELEN
frightened for you
Theres the sound of a car pulling up He hurries to

the
other room
EXT HOUSE - NIGHT
The Police arrive three cars Mark appears at an
upstairs
window with his camera
SERGEANT
Look out
He thinks Mark has a gun They all duck Mark raises
his
camera and photographs them The Police recover and
charge
for the house Mark disappears
INT DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera He
knows exactly what he has to do
HELEN
Mark Mark Give yourself up
MARK
Ive been ready for this for
such a long time
Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall
Then
he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude
towards
him
HELEN
What are you
MARK
Itll be all right
He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the
camera

then switches on all the floodlights WE CAN HEAR the
Policemen pounding on the door

MARK
I can beat that
He crosses to a switch - presses it The room is

filled
with a small boys screaming
HELEN
Give yourself up Mark
He stands next to her and looks at his long array of
cameras WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted
with
a small metal disc (a delayed release) and that some
of
the older cameras have flashlights attached
MARK
Watch them Helen Watch them
say goodbye - one by one -
(he presses a master
switch on the wait)
Ive timed this so often
Slowly he walks past his cameras As he does the
metallic
disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the
eye
of each camera winks once as if in salute Some go off
with flashlights on either side of the room The sound
of
footsteps hurrying up the stairs
Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer — are the spikes
of
the tripod The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the
approach - and Helens terrified face
HELEN
No - No
The childs screaming reaches its peak as Mark
approaches
the spikes Ahead of him on the small table where
his

projector stands is Helens book The Magic Camera

MARK
I wish I could have found your
faces for you

The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door

MARK
Helen - Im afraid
The

door
spikes
falls
over

by

of

motionless

absolute

father

the

We see his face terrified in the magnifying mirror

spikes are against his throat The eye of the camera is
winking rapidly

MARK
Im glad Im afraid

Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room

as it breaks in Mark lunges forward against the

The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he
back He crashes against the small table which falls
He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him
the tripod and falls back with him covering his face
like a canopy WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine-
camera and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover
The Magic Camera

The Policemen hurry into the room They stare

at what they see

CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands

The childs screaming stops suddenly and in the

silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Marks
FATHERS VOICE (0S)

Dont be a silly boy theres

nothing to be afraid of

And a small voice answers

CHILDS VOICE (0S)
Good night Daddy

The spotlights begin to dim The dazzling white of
16mm screen fades slowly into greyness

The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small
child
OUT

THE END

FADE
