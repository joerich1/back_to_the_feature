EXT CHEMCO COMPOUND - DAY

Color 1ST ANNIVERSARY BANNERS flap along with swirling dust and bending
vegetation

as a HELICOPTER touches down on the CHEMCO grounds within its tall fences
near

its administration building

The banner reads

CHEMCO MALAYSIA--1ST ANNIVERSARY
This is just the beginning

CHEMCO EXECUTIVES are eagerly standing by with a handful of uniformed
SECURITY
PEOPLE keeping a respectful distance

A MALE SPOKESPERSON well groomed and David Duke-plastic-surgery handsome
talks

into a wireless mike ADDRESSING THE CAMERA as his THREE-MAN CREW tapes He
walks

toward the front entrance--

SPOKESPERSON
Just twenty miles from Kuala Lumpur
something bigs happening That something
is providing jobs for families That
something is revitalizing a once-depressed
local economy That something is developing
new technologies for todays ever-demanding
world That something -- is Chemco

He smiles--
EXT FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

A cluster of EXECUTIVES and MIDDLE MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL walk through the
front door

SPOKESPERSON
Its been a year since Chemco opened its
Malaysian operations and the venture is
a great success not only for Chemco but
for the employees that make up the Chemco
family For Chemco provides regular wages

benefits and technical training that
will allow them to compete well into the next
century

He pauses and smiles in front of the camera crew as the executives pass
In the background we see the helicopter door open
INT HELICOPTER

An AIDE WILSON reads from an itinerary
WILSON

CONGRESSWOMAN HELEN FILMORE who gives herself a last look in a compact
MIRROR
Early 30s shes attractive poised and professional

She snaps the compact closed pocketing it as

RYAN COOPER straightens his tie and puts on his jacket

Filmore goes to leave but Cooper stands in her way

COOPER

Atkins interjects--

ATKINS

Filmore glares at Cooper who returns the stare She then looks to Atkins

FILMORE
Lets just get this over with

Helen brushes past Cooper as does Atkins who throws him a condescending
stare--
Cooper restrains himself playing it cool slipping on his SHADES--

EXT CHEMCO
The SPOKESPERSON and CREW approach the three as they exit the helicopter-

SPOKESPERSON
The Chemco legacy began in Cleveland where
40 years ago Louis Spencer took a small
pharmaceutical company and made it one of
the largest corporations in the world
Today first-time Ohio congresswoman Helen
Filmore stops by to see how Louis Spencers
dream continues to grow

Filmore extends her hand to PETE OLO a handsome local man in his 30s

ATKINS
Helen this is Peter Olo director of
public relations Pacific region Peter
this is Congresswoman Helen Filmore of Ohio

OLO

that your country has given us

FILMORE

The people here are lovely Mr Olo I am

appreciation

Her charm and grace are most convincing Ryan Cooper stands uncomfortably in
the

background eyeing the place--

He notices the SECURITY GUARDS the CAMERA CREW--nothing that suspicious

ATKINS
Shall we get started

OLO

Everyone heads toward the Central Operations bldg
Cooper follows behind
EXT CENTRAL OPERATIONS - DAY

Under the large gleaming CYLINDER running the length of the plant the crew
tapes
the GENERAL MANAGER as he walks and points

Filmore and other executives listen smiles plastered to their faces

GEN MGR

wash that we use to refine the oremaking
it suitable for safe shipping through a
complex system of pipes to the waterfront

Filmore almost robotically uses this opportunity responding directly to the
camera

FILMORE

And thats creating new jobs there as well

to its economy

Cooper shakes his head

ATKINS
Thats correct
She takes a beat turning to Olo

FILMORE

FILMORE
I just need a drink of water Is

OLO

She nears Cooper

FILMORE

COOPER
Im not arguing Im just telling

FILMORE
(under her breath)
Look Cooper I dont care what my father
says if you embarrass me here youre going
to regret it understand

Atkins sees that the others are noticing--he approaches Cooper with a bunch
of

COINS--he takes Coopers hand and slaps them in it Atkins gives him a dirty
look

ATKINS
A soda sounds good Get me one too
Diet Lemon-Lime

Normally Cooper would have floored Atkins by now but he sizes up the waiting

CROWD
and the situation and suppresses his anger

COOPER
Anything else Maybe a sandwich

FILMORE
Just the soda please
Cooper heads down the hall Filmore watches him leave
smiles at the General manager

FILMORE
Whats next

GEN MGR
Central Operations straight ahead

sighs

then turns and

Filmore hides her discomfort as Pete Olo graciously helps her step over a low

piece
of piping as they move on

INT HALLWAY--

Cooper heads down the hallway muttering under his breath

He approaches a doorway and a suspicious-looking MAN pops out and shuts the

door
behind him eyeing Cooper--
Cooper stops and scrutinizes him for a second--

COOPER
You work here

MAN

COOPER

Wheres this soda machine
The man is caught off-guard He thinks it over--

COOPER
You know soda

The man hesitantly points down the hall--

MAN
Uharound that corner

COOPER

Cooper heads down the hall--when hes clear--
the man quickly disappears the other way
INT CENTRAL OPERATIONS - DAY

It resembles a war room Filmore looks over a board with Atkins Olo
the
General Manager Security maintains a respectful distance

The SPOKESPERSON is behind them facing camera

SPOKESPERSON
We are in Central Operationsthe nerve
center of Chemco filled with state-of-the
art computers processors and monitors At
Chemco the visions of tomorrow are becoming
realities today

The general manager speaks to Atkins and Filmore

GEN MGR
All activities in and around the plant
can be monitored and controlled from this
room Security is important to a plant
of this nature--

ATKINS

record

The Spokesperson approaches Filmore

A cluster of MIDDLE-AND-UPPER MANAGERS collect in the center of the room

INT HALLWAY - DAY
CLOSE on a SODA CAN dropping from a soda machine--

Cooper puts the rest of the coins in--and picks the only choice--YOO-HOO or
other
cheesy-chocolate-drink equivalent--

COOPER
Looks like Yoo-Hoo for you pal

He grabs the sodas and heads down the hall--

he cuts the cornersoon he suspects something--the place is EERILY QUIET--
too
quiet--he walks back--

INT CENTRAL OPERATIONS - DAY

The group gets in a line as the spokesperson positions Filmore--
SPOKESPERSON

The room quiets down
SPOKESPERSON
Our promotional directors have requested
a group shot of everyone saying the
Chemco slogan in unison because it
captures the essence of all your hard
work here in this first anniversary of
the opening of this plant

There is a SMATTERING of confused applause--
SPOKESPERSON
Now on the count of three if we could
all give a thumbs up and say This Is
Just The Beginning you would make the
people back in Cleveland very happy

Filmore casts an unenthusiastic look to Atkins amid some nervous laughter--

FILMORE
Your idea

HEADS and FACES BLAST OPEN--BULLETS BURST THROUGH DRESS-SHIRTS--

Atkins pulls Filmore to cover--

Wilson manages to FLEE the room--a GUNMAN chases after him--

Olo dives for cover--

The GUNFIRE IS MERCILESS--tearing apart the SCREAMING CROWD-

A BOOT SMASHES Cooper out cold--

EXT GUARD GATE - DAY

Two SECURITY GUARDS fire 45s at GUNMEN who seem to be proliferating like

around the compound--

They manage to hit one as--

A GUNMAN kneels and FIRES a small GRENADE LAUNCHER at the concrete guard
shack--

DIRECT HIT--

The SHACK EXPLODES neutralizing the guards--

Streams of LIQUID ACID rain down on him--he SCREAMS as acid fries BLOODY
RIVULETS

across his face--

INT CENTRAL OPERATIONS - DAY

The spokesperson RICHTER turns off the alarm

One of the video crew SMITTY a humorless hacker with a sunken face and a

convicts physique heads straight to the CONTROL CONSOLE and immediately
begins
breaching the system

Richter approaches the SURVIVORS--FILLMORE ATKINS OLO the GENERAL MANAGER
the

VICE-PRESIDENT and three others all in the process of being blindfolded by
two

terrorists--RED and MUTT

He takes the opportunity to seductively tie a blindfold around Filmore
eyeing her
while Filmore tries valiantly to stay cool--

RICHTER
Enjoying the tour so far

FILMORE
Are you going to kill us

RICHTER
I dont know If you gave me a
reason to

He finishes tying the blindfold and casually looks at the group
RICHTER
For example

He randomly picks the GENERAL MANAGER--blindfolded oblivious--
RICHTER

Red and Mutt grab the General Manager who loses all composure breaking down
like
a child--

GEN MGR
Noooo--Noooo-—

Red throws him to his knees then kicks the back of his head--his face hits
the

floor--

BAM BAM BAM Richter fires three bullets to the head--

Filmore listens rigid with terror--

RICHTER
Now see I didnt like his tie

He turns his attention to Smitty in front of a security console displaying
an

extensive network of monitors

His HEADSET is on--

RICHTER

She looks at him with disgust

FILMORE
Im sure they were

Suddenly someone UNLOCKS the door--

Filmore reacts with terror--

COOPER slams to the ground and the door slams shut and is locked--

them
Cooper slips his bound hands around his legs and yanks off his blindfold--

Cooper scans the room then glares at Filmore

COOPER

RICHTER
(to camera)
Twenty-five-million

RICHTER
Does that include Helen Filmore United
States congresswoman

ALONZO

RICHTER

taken seriously at this point or does
Washington think these people are just a

Well I-I hope that--that--
RICHTER
(makes a buzzing noise)
Times up

The men watching react with horror--

Richter signs off in his best professional demeanor

WHITE
Chemco is willing to deal with him meet his
demands I can have the money there in an hour

Myers looks up at White--
MYERS

The United States government doesnt
strike deals with terrorists Mr White

WHITE
That plant and the applied technologies
therein are valued at upwards of a billion
dollars

Myers glares at White who suddenly realizes his callousness--he looks to
Sen
Filmore--

WHITE
And--of course there is the human cost
which is incalculable

MYERS
Im sure youll figure it out

The senator stares deep in contemplation--

SEN FILMORE
I knew something like this would happen
They must have killed Ryan Cooper

MYERS
Ryan Cooper What the hell is he doing
there

SEN FILMORE
I hand-picked him for the job

WHITE
Whos Ryan Cooper

MYERS

Sen Filmore looks at White

SEN FILMORE

Ryan Cooper was a secret service agent
that took a bullet for me as I lefta
press conference four years ago

WHITE
Of course of course--I remember that

SEN FILMORE
Then when all the god-damned allegations
started I found out that so-called friends
have a way of disappearing I found his
loyalty refreshing and never lost track of
him even after he left the service I sent
him to protect my daughter but now

His voice trails off as he gets up and looks out the window

SEN FILMORE
God theyve got my little girl
INT HOLDING ROOM

Tension escalates in the windowless room Cooper notices the SECURITY CAMERA
mounted high in the corner--

FILMORE
What are we going to do

COOPER

PETE OLO tries to dig in his pocket--

OLO
I have a lighter

COOPER
Even better

Olo pulls it out--

COOPER

Olo holds out the lighter and lights it as Cooper holds his wrists near it--
the
ROPES begin to smolder--

Suddenly--the door UNLOCKS--
Cooper immediately gets back in position and sits down--

RED and MUTT enter and scan the terrified group--
One gunman smells something in the air and looks around--

Cooper stares at the ground clenching his jaw
The other gunman grabs the VICE-PRESIDENT who violently struggles--
VICE PRESIDENT
Nooo Please--God dont do this
Noooo--noooo-—

The others react in horror as the man is dragged to his certain death--the
door
SLAMS and locks

Filmore fixes her eyes on Cooper who goes back to Olo Avoiding the
SECURITY

FILMORE
Think of something Please

SNAP The rope breaks--Coopers free--he scans the room--

ATKINS
What are we going to do
He heads over to the SECURITY CAMERA--he looks at it--

COOPER

Cooper jumps up and grabs the BRACKET of the security camera--and RIPS it off
the
wall--wires popping and crackling--

INT CENTRAL OPERATIONS
CLOSE on the monitor blinking out--

PAN to Richter standing over his SMITTY who is scanning sequences on his
computer
screen

RICHTER
Have you broken it yet Weve got six
more heads and that means six more hours

SMITTY
Im in to the directory but theyve
codified the stockpile--numerically

Smitty types at his keyboard--

RICHTER
Of course its codified Each number
probably corresponds to a compound Have
them pull every compound from the lab and
compare it to the codes till you figure
it out--thats what youre here for

SMITTY
I know what Im here for-you dont
need to remind me

Another terrorist--BATES approaches Richter

BATES
A crowd is forming outside we got
helicopters overhead--theyre all
over us

RICHTER
Excellent

BATES
Weve got Washington on the line
weve got Chemco on the line--they
really want to talk
RICHTER
Of course they do

Richter looks himself over on a mounted mirror approvingly giving
his
professional correspondents smile as
he combs his hair
RICHTER
I think its time for a new
installment
He turns and approaches the VICE PRESIDENT pale and trembling
RICHTER
Something tells me you dont want to

be on TV friend

SMITTY

Richter turns and faces the tech--
SMITTY

The monitors off Someones

WHAM Olo POUNCES on RED grabbing the gun--

In the split-second that follows Cooper WRENCHES Mutts gun twisting Mutts
arm

sharply--

Struggling RED FIRES into the CEILING--Atkins and Filmore try to shield
themselves-

Cooper takes the gun butt and WHAM SMASHES MUTT in the jaw-

Mutt staggers back as Cooper WHIRLS the gun and SMASHES him across the face--
Mutt

whips around and collapses--

RED runs out of ammo before he BASHES Olo in the face--

Olo lets go of the gun as--

Cooper spins on his heel his foot CRACKING RED across the jaw--he staggers--
BAM BAM A lightning combination sends Red to the ground--out

Smoldering debris flakes from the ceiling gunsmoke wafting through the room
Filmore stares at Cooper in amazement as does Atkins--

Cooper check Mutts machine gun--he also has a 45 automatic on him--he then
looks

at Olo--

COOPER
You did good Real good

Olo gestures to the 45

OLO
I can handle one of those

Cooper is at first reluctant but decides to give it to him anyway--
Olo checks the cartridge and flips the safety off--

COOPER
You can cover the rear

Olo soberly nods

FILMORE
What now

COOPER
Were outta here--
He heads to the door

COOPER
--you have a dinner at eight remember

INT CENTRAL OPERATIONS

Brandishing his 45 Richter sits in front of the camera with the VICE-

PRESIDENT
seated next to him like some perverse talk show guest Richter addresses

him--

RICHTER
Tell us about the day you decided to
work for Chemco that must have been
an exciting moment in your life

Trembling the Vice president stares hard at Richter--

RICHTER
Would you care to shed some light on that
incident Im sure wed all like to know
about--
The vice-president SPITS in Richters face keeping his steely gaze--

Richter calmly wipes the spit off with a hankie and addresses the camera--
RICHTER
This man slays me ladies and gentlemen

But I think were out of time so--

RED and MUTT stagger in bruised and bloodied--Richter gets up--

RICHTER

RICHTER
Jee-sus Christ You have to be
the stupidest--

Using the distraction the Vice-president MAKES A RUN for it--
Richter SHOOTS the vice-president in the back blasting him forward--he

CRASHES
into some CHAIRS--DEAD
Richter calmly looks at the cameraman--

RICHTER

He looks at a humiliated Red and Mutt--

RICHTER

Gadgets fill rows of counters cluttered with an assortment of test tubes
beakers

and Bunsen burners--

Cooper crashes in and searches for CHEMICALS--

FILMORE
What are you doing

He finds a glass cabinet--
COOPER
You know what the boy scouts say
Filmore--

He SMASHES the glass with the butt of his rifle and clears the jagged shards-

COOPER
--be prepared

FILMORE
We dont have time

COOPER
Yeah and we dont have much ammo
either
He finds some powdered POTASSIUM CHLORATE then looks at the others--
COOPER
Dont wait on me Take the stairs

ATKINS
Lets go

Reluctantly Filmore follows the others

Cooper then frantically searches for something else--

POV of someone WATCHING COOPER--

Cooper finds what he wants--SULFURIC ACID--

Suddenly--the terrorist BATES suddenly JUMPS Cooper--WRENCHES his arm--
the GUN DROPS and the two men CRASH into a counter--

Cooper spins the man and FLIPS him onto a counter SMASHING glass coils
beakers--

Bates immediately springs up and rips a BLADE from his belt--

Ripping it through the air he goes after Cooper who barely avoids the
blade--the
man SLASHES wildly--

In a ballsy move Cooper grabs the mans hand in mid slash stopping it dead
with a
loud SLAP--

they struggle furiously CRASHING into another COUNTER--
Bates is on top of Cooper forcing the razor-sharp blade dangerously close to

his
face--
Suddenly Cooper SHIFTS and lets go--the terrorists blade stabs the slate
counter

as Cooper SMASHES BATES head with his elbow--

Bates crashes down as Cooper grabs a corked bottle of SULFURIC ACID and
SMASHES it

over the mans head--

Bates SCREAMS in hysterical agony as the acid douses his head--

Cooper rolls down and snatches up his gun before BLASTING the man with a
concise

burst of gunfire--

Bates staggers and CRASHES through the glass wall collapsing halfway into

He checks the grenade launcher--ONE GRENADE LEFT--

He runs back the other way--

WHITE
He wouldnt take it on the helicopters
Hed transport it through pipelines

WHITE
They were probably topping off a docked
tanker while he stalled for time--without
anyone being the wiser

A dismayed look crosses Whites face--

He doesnt even need her
He looks up grasping for a thread of hope--

SEN FILMORE

Right on time Richter--

RICHTER
Helen this is Captain Stockton--
Captain Congresswoman Helen Filmore
the pride of Ohio
Stockton extends his hand--Filmore just stares at him--

The captain looks her over tipping his cap--

Richter glances back at

A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS on alert with weapons drawn maintaining a substantial
distance--
Richter smiles at Stockton--

RICHTER

RICHTER

RICHTER

slop in the galley

RICHTER
Captain it would be impossible to
turn down such a gracious request

Richter looks at Filmore--

RICHTER
What say Helen You havent eaten
all day--and come to think of it--

Stockton and Richter laugh as Richter shoves her forward--they head toward
the ship-

A COUPLE SCUMMY-LOOKING SEAMEN

Leer at Filmore as she boards grinning looking like they just crawled out
ofa

dumpster--they trade snorts from a hip flask their DRUNKEN minds filling
with

ideas--

They remove the last chain mooring the ship and get on board--

And then we see a HELICOPTER

A STORAGE HATCH DOOR above the landing bar SLOWLY OPENS--

We see COOPER exit the cramped storage hatch--clothes dirty and torn--

he quickly gets his bearings--
When all is clear he LOOKS OUT at the Olympia--pulling out--

He JUMPS and grabs the metal gate around the deck pulling himself on board

Why should I worry Is there a
problem

STOCKTON

Well there was uh a little dissent
about the amount of the bonus--

RICHTER
Dissent

STOCKTON

Stockton chews and swallows--
STOCKTON
But I explained your generosity
and that settled the whole matter

Stockton freshens Richters wine glass--

RICHTER

Richter raises his glass

INT LOWER DECK - NIGHT
Cooper stealthily moves through a darkened corridor--
Up ahead a DOOR OPENS--

Cooper presses himself against the wall--hidden by a shadow-

TWO SEAMEN exit the room--closing the door behind them--

SEAMAN

I was a thousand miles from my old

lady on a free port and just got paid--

OPENER--

Suddenly--we hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS approaching--Cooper ducks--—
A SEASICK TERRORIST enters the supply room looking very nauseous--
Cooper watches as the Terrorist looks for DRAMAMINE--groaning
SEASICK
Oh my GodIm gonna puke

He finds the first aid supplies--
He pulls out a packet of TABLETS and fumbles with the wrapper--
He takes the pills and gulps them down--

circumstances

FILMORE
Like where--in your dreams

Before Richter can respond the seasick TERRORIST hurries back--

SEASICK
Sorry--I was getting some seasick
pills
RICHTER
Not to worry
He keeps his eyes on Filmore--
RICHTER

We were just saying goodnight
Without another word Filmore turns and enters her quarters slamming the
door

behind herself right in Richters face

RICHTER
Guard her With your life

Richter heads down the corridor toward his own quarters--—

The guard looks miserable and seasick--

Unseen by all Cooper watches the whole thing--

He nods knowing where to get her when the time comes--

He looks back behind him looks back at Filmores door then back again--
He heads back the way he came--

back on the day beside himself with insane confidence--

He laughs to himself as he swirls the brandy in the snifter before taking
swig--

He scans the shelf of BOOKS before him selecting a copy of MOBY DICK--

RICHTER
Call megoddamn Ishmael

He laughs and gets comfortable turning to page one sipping his brandy--
INT FILMORES QUARTERS

Having turned down the lights Filmore sits up in her bed--

She gazes through the shadows exhausted but defiant--

The ships steady swaying pacifies her She fights to keep her eyes open

She opens them again but its no usethey close again

RANDY SEAMAN 2
Its easy when the boat is going UP

in it--

The terrorist cant take much more--

TERRORIST

RANDY SEAMAN 2
Man in rough weather this boat just

The two seamen look at each other and smile drunkenly--
INT FILMORES QUARTERS

Filmore sleeps in dim shadows on her bed--

The door to her quarters OPENS and CLOSES with a CREAK--
Filmore BOLTS to attention--

Who is it

The two seamen stand like ghostly figures in the dim shadows--

Concealing her fear Filmore gets up and faces them--

FILMORE
I want you out of here at once

They push her back on the bed with malicious intent--
RANDY SEAMAN 1
Begging your pardon maam--but
your wants dont quite enter into

The lunge for her and she SCREAMS trying to claw herself

They PAW at her--she defends herself KNEEING one hard in
SCRATCHING the other--

This only fuels their determination--

FILMORE
Helllp

the balls--severely
One grabs her covering her mouth stifling her cries--
The other RIPS OPEN her DRESS--
She struggles in vain as the seaman fondles her--

Loosening his pants the other seaman works himself up--
Filmore shuts her eyes trying to block out the horror--

Suddenly the door to the cabin BURSTS OPEN--

A SHADOWY FIGURE OF A MAN rushes in pulling the rapist off of her--
Filmore falls to the floor struggling to see whats happening--

One seaman PULLS A KNIFE--

The man WRENCHES the seamans arm yanking it HARD behind his back before
wrapping

his ARM around his neck--YANKING HARD on the jaw--BREAKING HIS NECK--
The other seaman CHARGES and catches the BLADE square in the heart--—

The two seaman collapse to the ground--DEAD

SNAP RICHTER turns on the light wiping his hands as if he just swatted
couple

of flies--

RICHTER
Im sorry what did you say

Filmore pales then says nothing
Richter scrutinizes her for a second--
RICHTER
Im sorry about this Im going
to have to have a few words with
Stockton--his men need a lesson
in manners
Filmore looks very sexy and vulnerable at this moment--
RICHTER
Perhaps youll find my quarters more
to your liking--
She looks up at him in disbelief--
INT BOILER ROOM

Cooper SLINKS into the boiler room--
He sees an ENGINEER manning the complicated devices that regulate the flow of
steam

to the TURBINE BLADES

Cooper looks through a metal screen door and sees what he needs--a can of
GASOLINE--

He silently enters the room and opens the gas can--

He pours the LYE into the can--it SIZZLES as he plunks the candles in--

He takes the container and begins to SHAKE IT--

VOICE(OS)
Hey

Cooper whips around to see an ENGINEER--

ENGINEER1

Cooper plays it cool--
COOPER
Oh
He puts the gas can down--
The other ENGINEER approaches-—
COOPER

He smiles at the two stone-faced engineers Cooper feigns enthusiasm for the
boiler room and walks out in the middle of it

COOPER
God-damn

The engineers follow him

COOPER
Thats one hell of an engine
He looks at the two men--
COOPER
Far cry from the old outboard back

The engineers begin to warm slightly--

Cooper focuses on a large heavily gauged metal CONTRAPTION-

COOPER
This must power the turbines huh

ENGINEER1
Sorta yeah

Cooper walks around like a kid in a candy store--the engineers eye him like
hes an
idiot--
COOPER
Shit what happens when this thing

Cooper looks over at an electronic PANEL--The AUXILIARY ALTERNATOR--—
ENGINEER1
Dont worry junior were prepared
for everything
Cooper nods like a dolt smiling--
POW Cooper SMASHES the first engineer in the face--a LIGHTNING COMBINATION-
-he
crashes to the ground--
In the split second that follows Cooper WHIPS his
foot around and CONNECTS with the 2nd engineers SKULL--sending him to the

ground--

COOPER
Yeah youre prepared alright

Cooper heads over to the GAS CAN--picks it up--
He heads over to A CABINET that has a coffee machine microwave etc on it--
He rips open the drawers finding a STEAK KNIFEA CAN OPENER--

He opens the GAS CAN with the opener--turning it upside down and shaking it-
a brown substance resembling SLIME plops out on the counter--
He glances back over at the GENERATOR--

She sips the brandy staring hard at Richter--HATE burning in her eyes--he
stares
back determined--
RICHTER

Youre a very headstrong woman--

sometimes you tend to forget the

impulses of your body--your desires--
He grabs her closer--VIOLENTLY--
Then--

BOOOOOMMMM A huge explosion is heard--the two feel a tremor as the lights
go out--

Filmore takes her brandy glass and SMASHES it over Richters face making a
run for

it--

wall--he

pulls out his GUN and shoves it hard into her temple--

Richter and Filmore fall as the launch swings out and slams back against the
side

of the hull--

Cooper slowly comes to--completely disoriented--he shakes his head like a
punch-

drunk boxer

POV of a blurry double-vision deck--Smitty descending in the other launch--
Cooper gets up staggers falls--

Smitty disappears from the deck descending--

EXT PORT HULL--

Richter and Filmore land in the water as Richter shoves Filmore toward the

bow and
fires up the OUTBOARD motor--
EXT STARBOARD HULL

Smitty is descending when suddenly--

Cooper LEAPS and lands on the deck of the launch--
SMITTY rams him attempting to send Cooper overboard--

Struggling to keep his bearings Cooper RETALIATES--
smashing Smitty in the face--

The two struggle--

One of the ROPES on the STERN begins to break as the men jar the craft
violently--

POW Smitty connects with Cooper--AGAIN--

But Cooper whips around and BACKHANDS Smitty before PASTING HIM with a
withering

combination--

SNAP The stern line gives way as the boat swings in a diagonal slamming
against

the hull--

Smitty tumbles backwards grabbing the OUTBOARD to keep from falling--
Cooper DIVES and yanks the RIPCORD--

The engine ROARS to life the PROPELLER grazing Smittys sternum--

Cooper YANKS the engine up--

The propeller SLICES OPEN SMITTYS CHEST as he crashes into the water--
The launch slowly descends--

EXT PORT HULL - NIGHT

Richter and Filmore speed away from the tanker as an EXPLOSION goes off on
deck--

sending debris through the air--

EXT STARBOARD HULL

Cooper lets the last ropes free as Smitty climbs back up on the boat as it
pulls

out--

He POUNCES on Cooper--who breaks free--

Cooper SMASHES SMITTY with a backhand--

Smitty CHARGES and PUSHES COOPER OVER--

Coopers legs hook the edge as he falls in backwards--
He struggles to get up but Smitty SHOVES his face under trying to suffocate
him--

Cooper swallows water suffocating--

Smitty clenches his teeth using all his might to keep Cooper under--

In a desperate surge of energy Cooper LIFTS HIS LEGS and LOCKS SMITTYS NECK-
CHOKING HIM--

Smitty struggles to break free--

UNDERWATER--—

We see Cooper grimace and JERK--

SNAP--Smittys jaw goes askew and his neck BREAKS--

Cooper FLIPS him overboard--the two men crash into the water--

Cooper splashes to the surface coughing and struggles on board lowering
h

wropeller into the water---the boat SPEEDS OFF--

EXT SEA

Richter and Filmore round the stern as COOPER approaches from the other side-

Richter speeds maniacally--wind RIPPING through his hair--

FROM AROUND THE STERN COMES COOPER--

Richter raises his gun and FIRES at the fast-approaching boat--
Cooper ducks and aims his boat at theirs--

BANG BANG BANG--CLICK CLICK Richter is out of ammo--

Filmore charges at him trying to wrench him from the steering--
He CRACKS HER ACROSS THE FACE--she falls to the deck--

COOPER JAMS the boat into HIGH GEAR and begins to run parallel to Richter--
Richter slams his boat into Coopers--Coopers into his--

Then Cooper does the unexpected--

He LEAPS off the boat--ONTO RICHTERS--

Coopers boat begins to SPIRAL MADLY--

Cooper POUNCES on Richter--but Richter grabs Cooper by the arm and HURLS HIM
onto
the deck--

Like two sinewy springs Nick legs send Richter airborne--
Richter crashes back--

the boat spins FURIOUSLY out of control--

Bleeding from the corner of her mouth Filmore reaches up for the nearest
to

keep her steady--the STEERING WHEEL--

the two men exchange WITHERING BLOWS as they stagger around the speeding
craft--

In a last-chance attempt at killing Cooper once for all he LAUNCHES into
offensive that has Coopers ears ringing--

But Cooper SURGES--sending Richter crashing to the stern--
Cooper staggers back and looks ahead--

THEYRE SPEEDING TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE TANKER--NO WHERE TO TURN--
Cooper GRABS Filmore and YANKS HER UP--

COOPER
JUMP

They JUMP from the speeding BOAT tumbling violently into the water--

Richter looks up for a SECOND--

WHAM THE BOAT EXPLODES IN A FIREBALL against the hull of the ship--
Annihilating

Richter--

EXT TANKER

BOOOMMMM More explosions on the tanker create a domino effect--

thin

an

Cooper swims as hard as he can drags Filmore toward their boat which spirals

ina
circle--

COOPER
Stay clear--

Cooper gets hold of a MOORING ROPE on the of the dangerously spinning boat

and
struggles aboard--

He runs and kills the engine--the boat slows down--
Cooper circles and nears FILMORE--he reaches out for her--

She extends her hand but HE MISSES HER--
Cooper juices up the boat and CIRCLES AROUND HER AGAIN--this time grabbing
Cooper
by the hand--

He yanks her safely on board--

The two collapse to the deck as a series of EXPLOSIONS on the tanker begin to
ESCALATE--

Cooper fires up the boat and heads away from the tanker as

BOOOOMMMM The tanker is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS--its huge frame begins to
sink--

EXT COAST GUARD CUTTER
A sentry flashes a powerful beam out toward the flaming sinking ship--
catching
Filmore and Cooper their boat a little speck in the water--
SENTRY

Weve got survivors--about fifteen

hundred feet southwest
We then see JACKSON step out on deck and look through his BINOCULARS--
EXT SEA
Jackson sees Cooper and Filmore--very much alive--

Jackson lowers his binoculars in disbelief smiling--

JACKSON
That son-of-a-bitch

INT ROOM IN DC
Myers is on the phone--
MYERS
Stand by
He looks to Myers and Sen Filmore--

MYERS
Its over

Sen Filmore drops his head in despair--

MYERS
Cooper got her out

Filmore looks up as if the clouds parted to reveal heaven itself--
EXT SEA

Passing floating barrels of the BINARY CHEMICALS they race away from the
flames

and toward the RISING SUN On the horizon the COAST GUARD CUTTER
approaches--—

A wounded exhausted Cooper and Filmore trade looks More than gratitude
there is
an attraction in their eyes But neither really knows how to express it

COOPER
Well Filmore--

FILMORE
Well Cooper

COOPER

Looks like youre not going to make
that dinner after all

FILMORE
I guess not Cooper

She looks out at dawn spreading across the horizon--

FILMORE
-but you cant say we didnt try

The boat heads off into the distance

THE END
