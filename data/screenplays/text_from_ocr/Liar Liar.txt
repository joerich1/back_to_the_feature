INT FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING

Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher MS
BERRY The word Work is on the blackboard

MS BERRY
Work Today were going to
share what our parents do for
work
QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
their desks addressing the class

JEFF

MELINDA

CAROLYN

engine-ear

CRAIG -

KELLY

ELLIOT

CRAZED)
My father is a postal worker
The QUICK CUTS end with MAX

MAX

My moms a teacher
As Max starts to sit

MS BERRY
And your dad

MAX
(HESITANT)
My dad Hes a liar
MS BERRY

(taken aback)

A liar I dont think you
mean a liar

MAX
Well he wears a suit and

goes to court and talks to the
judge and--

MS BERRY
(RELIEVED)
Oh I see-- you mean hes a
lawyer

Max shrugs

INT COURTROOM -- DAY

FLETCHER REID early 30s stands before the JUDGE

manner is utterly genuine and convincing

His
FLETCHER
A dark street a stormy
night two desperate men
struggle one man is taken
to the hospital the other to
ja il The prosecutor wants
you to believe this is an
open-and-shut case of a poor
man brutally victimized
He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70s

FLETCHER (CONTD)
Well for once I agree with
t he prosecutor This is an
open-and shut case -- but the
true victim is my client
Fletchers CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit

FLETCHER (CONTD)
Put yourself in his shoes for
a moment--walking home from
church alone ina
frightening part of the
suburbs

As he describes his clients movements Fletcher ACTS
THEM

OUT

FLETCHER (CONTD)
Youre nervous timid looking
over your shoulder -- when
suddenly you encounter him--

(pointing at the

old man)
pouncing from the shadows
You quiver in fear The
streetlight flashes on
something shiny in his hand--
a knife

Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker brandishing a
weapon The jurors RECOIL

FLETCHER (CONTD)
And in that terrifying instant
you do what any respectable
citizen would -- you defend
y ou rse lf Only after you
shatter his arm and collarbone
do you realize its alla
mistake the man was merely
walking away from an ATM
machine the apparent flash of
metal caused by his bank card
He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card

FLETCHER (CONTD)

(CONCERNED)
As you stand over his
crumpled though potentially
still-dangerous form your
he art goes out to him You
want to help First you
gather up the many bills he
dropped to stop them from
bl owi ng away Second in an
effort to get the name and
number of someone to notify
you take his wallet Finally
you leap into the mans Lexus
to head for assistance when
suddenly a police car speeds
up You breathe a sigh of
relief Someone to look -after
the injured man Oh joy
But do the police applaud your
initiative Do they hail your
heroism No-- they arrest you
and throw you in the slammer
He walks along the jury box

FLETCHER (CONTD)
And why Why does the State
turn its massive power against
this individual
(takes an

IMPRESSIVE
moment then
answers his own

QUESTION )
Discrimination
(to a black

JUROR)
But this time its not based
on race
Fletcher

In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN

(to a female

JUROR)

Not based on gender
(to a man wearing
a crucifix)

Not based on religion
(to a heavy set

JUROR)
No--this time its
discrimination based on size
I know what the prosecution
wants you to think - - it
always the big guys fault
Is that what weve come to as
a society -- persecuting
people because theyre large

s

FLETCHER (CONTD)
Shame on you Mister
Prosecutor Shame on you
(turning back to

JURY)
The state is trying to
barbeque my client on the spit
of Justice Only you can douse
the flames The decision is
your s And pleasedont let
your emotions run away with
y ou The fact that my client
is a family man raising his
sons alone after the tragic
death of their mother has
absolutely no bearing on this
case

fq

FLETCHER (CONTD)
Instead let cold reason be
your guide as you decide the
fate of this church-going
orphan-rasing widower

points accusingly at the opposition

Fletcher returns to his seat

EXT COURTHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Jurors dab their eyes

Fletcher bounds down the stairs passing a fellow LAWYER
LAWYER

CLIENT
Hey great job Mr Reid I
wish there was some way I
could show my appreciation

FLETCHER
Stay out of my neighborhood
after dark
A PUBLICIST carrying a clipboard approaches Fletcher

PUBLICIST
Mr Reid do you have a
moment-â€”

FLETCHER
No Im late picking up my
son

Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances

Unquestionably
Fletcher walks faster PUZZLED that he has answered
truthfully The beggar is even more puzzled

BEGGAR

FLETCHER
No

BEGGAR

FLETCHER

Because I resent your

INT COURTROOM - MORNING

A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondents table

VIRGINIA
You look like youre having a
rough morning

He WINCES as he recognizes the words Then an extremely
wealthy respectable industrialist RICHARD COLE enters
with his attorney DANA APPLETON young brisk confident

DANA
Good morning Fletcher

FLETCHER
Dana

RICHARD
All right Virginia how much
will it take to put an end to
this

FLETCHER

Fifty per cent of your estate
Richard is SHOCKED

DANA
Fifty per cent With a pre-
nup and proof of adultery
Whats your case

FLETCHER
Our case is simply this
Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CANT

GET THE WORDS OUT He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS but
succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land

DANA
Interesting though based on
your track record I expected
a little more

Nearing panic Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
the brief

FLETCHER
Wa it Wait Ive got it in
writing
But when Dana tries to take the document the astonished
Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT

DANA
Let go

FLETCHER
Im trying

He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS
HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out
At this moment the BAILIFF calls

BAILIFF
All rise for the Honorable
Judge William Stevens

DANA
Very funny Fletcher You

JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench

JUDGE STEVENS

Cole versus Virginia Cole
Howre we doing this morning
counsel

DANA
Fine thank you

JUDGE STEVENS
And you Mr Reid

FLETCHER
Well Im a little upset about
a bad sexual episode I had
last night--
Fletcher screeches to a standstill suddenly aware of what
he just said After an awkward silence--

JUDGE STEVENS

(DRYLY)
Well youre still young
Itll happen more and more
In the meantime what do you
say we get down to business
First Mr Reid I see that
your client was previously
represented by Mr Rand of
your office
FLETCHER
Yes Your Honor

JUDGE STEVENS
I take it youre seeking to
substitute in as counsel

FLETCHER
Yes Your Honor

JUDGE STEVENS
Fine fine And for the
record the reason is

FLETCHER
Mr Rand had severe ethical
objections to my clients
case
Fletcher is incredulous Somehow his greatest asset in the
world his mouth has become his worst enemy

JUDGE STEVENS
I take it you dont share the
same ethical objections Mr

Reid

FLETCHER
I have lower standards Your
Honor

JUDGE STEVENS
I see Well if Mrs Cole
wants the substitution of
counsel Ill allow it Is
that what you want Mrs Cole
Virginia looks to the judge then to Fletcher whose
unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier

VIRGINIA
(UNSURE)
Yes
JUDGE STEVENS
Fine

VIRGINIA
(aside to

FLETCHER)
What are you doing
FLETCHER

(WORRIED)

I dont know
(to judge with

SOME

DESPERATION)
Your Honor I d like a
continuance

JUDGE STEVENS
This case has already been
delayed several times Mr
Reid

FLETCHER
I realize that Your Honor
but I d really really really
like a continuance

JUDGE STEVENS
Ill have to hear good cause
counselor Whats the
problem

FLETCHERS POV

The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then
faster -- until we wind up squarely on --

FLETCHERS FACE

FLETCHER
I cant lie

JUDGE STEVENS

(IMPATIENT)
Commendable Mr Reid but Im
still waiting for the good
caus e Now do you have it or
not
FLETCHER

(TRUTHFUL)
Not

JUDGE STEVENS
Motion for a continuance
denied Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case

DANA
I dont think so Your Honor
Mr Reid made it abundantly
clear that the last thing in
the world he wanted was to --

FLETCHER
(DESPERATE)

SETTLE SETTLE SETTLE
Dana and Mr Cole look at Fletcher with surprise

JUDGE STEVENS
There appears to have been a
change in strategy Lets go
to my chambers and negotiate
He BANGS the gavel

INT JUDGE STEVENSS CHAMBERS - MORNING
Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge

DANA
Your Honor under the terms of
the prenuptual agreement if
Mrs Cole commits adultery
she is entitled to nothing
We have in our possession an
audiotape made by a licensed
private investigator of an
explicit act of sexual
congress with a man who is not
her husband

JUDGE STEVENS
Sounds pretty damning Mr
Reid
FLETCHER
It certainly does

DANA
However my client has no
desire to see his ex-wife
destitute Against my advice
hes willing to offer her a
cash settlement oftwo point
four million dollars

JUDGE STEVENS
Two four seems like a pretty
fair offer Mr Reid

FLETCHER
Fantastically fair
Phenominally fair In fact
Id say beyond fair bordering
on stupid
Dana fumes The judge finds Fletchers boldness
refreshing

JUDGE STEVENS
What are you suggesting Mr
Rei d That Ms Appletons
willingness to proffer such an
offer betrays a lack of faith
in her position

FLETCHER
(utterly sincere)
No not at all Shes got my
client dead to rights When

attorneys go to sleep at
night they dream of having a
case as strong as hers

DANA
Can the sarcasm Reid All
right I admit it -- Ive seen

you make even the lamest case

fly But this time I have

you Even Clarence Darrow

couldnt explain this away
She brandishes the audiotape

JUDGE SAMIOAN
Wel 1 Mr Reid without a
dynamite explanation Id say
youre dead in the water
Hows you clients story

FLETCHER
The best that money can buy
Y our Honor

JUDGE STEVENS
Strong corroborating evidence

FLETCHER
We have evidence that you are
not going to-believe
Despite herself Dana is beginning to look worried

JUDGE STEVENS
Youre pretty confident how
this trial is going to come
out eh Mr Reid

FLETCHER
(hopeless)

Confident is too weak a

word Your Honor I am

certain what will happen if I

take this puppy to trial The

verdict will be a stunning

humiliating defeat that will

cut a spectacularly promising

legal career off at the knees
Fletcher is referring to himself of course but Dana
thinks hes speaking about her She buckles

DANA
All right Double the offer
Four point eight And not a
penny more
(venomous to

FLETCHER)
Bastard
She storms out leaving an astounded Fletcher behind

JUDGE STEVENS
You are some negotiator Mr
Reid If your client has half
a brain shell jump at the
offer

sample of your veracity shall
we Carlotta
He grabs her purse from the desk rifles through it

JUDGE STEVENS
Mr Reid does this have a

point

FLETCHER

h er a minor And in the great
state of California NO MINOR

CAN ENTER INTO A LEGAL
CONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL
CONSENT INCLUDING--

DANA
(defeated to

HERSELF)
Prenuptual agreements

FLETCHER
(knows he has

THEM)

PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS THANK
YOU VERY LITTLE This
contract is void The fact
that my client gets nailed
more often than a two-by-four

Max nods Fletchers at a loss for how to begin Then

FLETCHER

You wanted me to stop lying
But lying isnt the problem
Why we lie thats the
problem Sometimes we lie to
make someone else feel better
But sometimes we lie because

sacrifice some things for more

important things Much more
important things I was so
