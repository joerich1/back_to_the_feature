SWINGERS

Third draft

1 EXT HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
The soundtrack opens with Frank Sinatras Fly Me to the
Moon
A HELICOPTER SHOT OF THE LA basin
The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of
points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the

city

We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we
approach Hollywood Boulevard Below is neon and the icy
thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood
and Vine

We continue west then quickly north

There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD
sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital
Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the

Architectural remnants of Hollywoods past whip up We are
heading east at treetop level A warm glow in the distance
quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes
cafes bookstores and a theater

We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass
showcase window of the Bourgeois Pig coffeehouse which
holds the translucent reflection of the full moon
A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders MIKE takes
the last drag with great effort then crushes it out He
sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that
once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer

MATCH CUT TO
EXT BOURGEOIS PIG COFFEEHOUSE - COUCHES AND TABLE IN FRONT
WINDOW - NIGHT

ROB sits down next to Mike pouring himself some tea

MIKE
And what if I dont want to give up on
her

ROB

You dont call

MIKE
But you said I shouldnt call if I
wanted to give up on her

ROB
Right

MIKE
So I dont call either way

ROB
Right
MIKE
So whats the difference

ROB
The only difference between giving up and
not giving up is if you take her back
when she wants to come back See you
cant do anything to make her want to
come back You can only do things to
make her not want to come back

MIKE
So the only difference is if I forget
about her or pretend to forget about her

ROB
Right

MIKE
Well that sucks

ROB
It sucks

MIKE
So its almost a retroactive decision
So I could like lets say forget about
her and when she comes back make like I
just pretended to forget about her

ROB
Rightor more likely the opposite

MIKE
Right Wait what do you mean

ROB
I mean first youll pretend not to care
not call - whatever and then
eventually you really wont care

MIKE
Unless she comes back first

ROB
Ah see thats the thing Somehow they
dont come back until you really dont
care anymore

MIKE
Theres the rub
ROB
Theres the rub

MIKE
Thanks man Sorry we always talk about
the same thing all the time

ROB
Hey man dont sweat it

MIKE
Its just that youve been there
Your advice really helps

ROB
No problem

MIKE
Rob I just want you to know youre the
only one I can talk to about her

ROB
Thanks Thanks man

the phone and hits autodial

CUT TO

EXT MIKES BUILDING - FRANKLIN AVENUE - NIGHT

Mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads

Hes trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff links
He approaches Trent who suavely leans against his worn down
ride Hes a tall slim good-looking cat His sharkskin
suit hangs well on his lanky frame as it tapers to his
ankles Sinatras Come Fly With Me on the tape deck adds
an elegance to the scene They exchange an impish grin and
depart without saying a word Maybe this isnt such a bad
idea

CUT TO

INT TRENTS CAR - DETAIL SHOT - SPEEDOMETER - NIGHT

The NEEDLE IS PINNED The gauges are blurred by the
vibration of the poorly tuned engine The SHOT WIDENS to
reveal that the Oil and Service dummy lights are both
illuminated causing an eerie red glow onto TRENTs white
knuckles

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

Trents car is red-lined The SWINGERS are Vegas bound Do
not pass go

MATCH CUT TO

INT TRENTS CAR - NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO

INT TRENTS CAR - HOURS LATER

The two swingers are starting to fray around the edges but
are unwilling to admit it to each other or themselves Frank
has been replaced by talk radio

The needle

TRENT
Vegas baby

MIKE
Vegas

is still buried

INT TRENTS CAR - MANY HOURS LATER

Sleep deprivation and desert static radio

TRENT
Vegas

MIKE
Vegas

INT TRENTS CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Mike is sleeping in the passenger seat

Trent points out a mountain range

separating
the desert
cobalt and
the craggy
transfixed

TRENT
Wake up baby

MIKE
(stirring)
Whu

TRENT
Look at it baby Vegas baby

DISSOLVE TO

DISSOLVE TO

It is now the only thing

them from their destination The surreal glow of
sky is accentuated by the loud slashing of the
ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by
peaks Mike slowly stirs from his slumber He is

by this affrontation of nature

It is his first

glimpse of the city without God

MIKE
(in reverie)
Vegas

CUT TO

EXT VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

The shrill cry of Basies fat brass section heralds the
arrival of the young swingers Their eyes drink every watt
of golden light as Sinatras crooning urges them on

Mike has either had enough sleep or so little that it no
longer matters Either way theres no turning back

They roll up to a casino valet TILT UP to a skull and
crossbones which looms overhead

CUT TO

INT TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - NIGHT

The two guys walk and talk down a fluorescent hallway It is
well past midnight and the only patrons at this hour are
tourists too drunk to sleep and compulsive gamblers who snuck
out of their rooms without waking their wives

It is a weeknight and it is beginning to become painfully
obvious that our boys are overdressed

The decor is nautical plaster Castings of bearded men with
primitive prosthesis clutching daggers between their teeth
are everywhere

All of ye olde promenade shoppes are closed

MIKE
(the first budding of
crankiness)
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean

TRENT
This is the hot new place besides you
love pirates Tell me Mikey doesnt love
pirates

MIKE
This is fuckin post-pubescent
Disneyland

TRENT
You gotta love the pirates baby The
pirates are money

The corridor empties into the equally kitch CASINO

MIKE
This place is dead I thought this was
the city that never sleeps

TRENT
Thats New York baby You should know
that Look at the waitresses Im gonna

get me a peg-leg baby

MIKE
Theyre all skanks

TRENT
Baby there are beautiful babies here

MIKE
Tee the beautiful babies dont work
Wednesdays midnight to six This is the
skank shift

TRENT
What are you talking about Look at all
the honeys

Trent contorts his face at a cute WAITRESS passing by with a
tray of drinks

TRENT
Arrrrg

The waitress cracks a smile as she crosses away Mike is
visibly embarrassed

MIKE
Cut that shit out

TRENT
She smiled baby

MIKE
Thats not cool

TRENT
Did she or did she not smile
MIKE
It doesnt matter

TRENT
Im telling you they love that shit

MIKE
Youre gonna screw up our plan

TRENT
Were gonna get laid baby

MIKE
First lets see what happens if we play
it cool

TRENT

What You think shes gonna tell her
pit-boss on us

MIKE
Dont make fun I think we can get some
free shit if we dont fuck around

TRENT
Whos fucking around Im not making fun
Lets do it baby

MIKE
The trick is to look like you dont need
it then they give you shit for free

TRENT
Well you look money baby We both
look money

Mike points to a semi-curtained semi-roped-off area near the
baccarat tables The clientele is classier but theyre
still obviously overdressed

MIKE
(pointing)
Thats where we make our scene

TRENT
You think theyre watching

MIKE
Oh theyre watching all right Theyre
watching
CUT TO

INT TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - THE CLASSY SECTION - NIGHT

Mike is at a blackjack table with Trent at his side The
game has paused to observe the newcomers as Mike draws a
billfold out of his breast pocket Theyre pulling it off
with only slightly noticeable effort

MIKE
I dont know I guess Ill start with
three hundred in uh blacks

Mike tries to hand the DEALER a handful of twenties after
counting them twice

DEALER
On the table

MIKE
Sorry

DEALER
You have to lay it on the table

MIKE
Uh I dont want to bet it all

The other players grow impatient

DEALER
Youre not allowed to hand me money sir
Youll have to lay it on the table if you
want me to change it

MIKE
(hastily laying down the bills)
Oh right

The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible
to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead
Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the
rain

DEALER
Blacks

Mikes attention is recaptured by the dealer but Trent
continues trying to peer through the smoked glass

MIKE
Huh

DEALER
You want this in black chips

MIKE
Sure thatll be fine

The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT
BOSS chirps the response Trents focus whips away from the
camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet
away

The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent
Mikes entire cash reserve Not quite the effect he had
hoped for

The swingers stare at the chips The players stare at the
swingers The dealer stares at the pit boss

MIKE
Do you have anything smaller

DEALER
Yes but Im afraid this table has a
hundred-dollar-minimum bet Perhaps

youd be more comfortable at one of our
lower stakes tables

The dealer indicates a FIVE-DOLLAR TABLE across the room
where an Hispanic woman deals to a BLUEHAIR a BIKER and a
COUPLE in matching Siegfried and Roy T-shirts

The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by
the pit boss

The tense silence is broken by

WAITRESS
Drinks
(then to Trent)
How about you Capn

Trent looks over to see that its the same WAITRESS who
flashed him a smile earlier At first he begins to smile
then remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle
of wills subtly shakes her off She smirks and starts to
leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger
Its a balsy move but everyones watching The kids going
for broke
MIKE
(to the waitress but never
breaking eye contact with the
dealer)
Ill have a vodka martini straight up
shaken not stirred very dry

Smooth Trent is impressed but masks his pride

WAITRESS
(under her breath cynically as
she writes it down)
One James Bond

Ow She exits

MIKE
(regaining composure)
No Blacks will be fine

Mike throws a chip in the circle Trent is shocked Thats
a hundred bucks Mike and Trent share a look The dealer
and the pit boss exchange glances Bets are all down and the
cards are meticulously dealt

The dealer has a two showing Mike has been dealt a five and
a six- eleven

TRENT
(hushed tones)
Double down

MIKE
(even husheder)
What
TRENT

Double down baby You gotta double down
on an eleven

MIKE
I know but

TRENT
You gotta do it

MIKE
but thats two hundred dollars
This is blood money

TRENT
If we dont look like we know what were
doing then we may as well
Everyones waiting for them

MIKE
I know

The dealer the pit boss and all the players look on as Mike
drops ANOTHER BLACK CHIP in the circle with a barely audible
yet deafening thud

MIKE
(with all the nonchalance he
can muster)
Double down

A bead of sweat

The sharp snap of a dealt card

Its a seven Eighteen

Disappointment twists their faces

Finally the dealer flips over his card

Its a king Twelve Here comes the bust
Flick - four Sixteen Here comes the bust

Flick - five Twenty one Groans all around except for the
swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence

Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his
stomach
MIKE

(to the pit boss)
Sure could use some dinner about now

SMASH CUT TO

Trent and Mike are wedged between the BLUEHAIR and the BIKER
At the FIVE DOLLAR TABLE They share a pile of red chips

TRENT
Im telling you baby you always double
down on an eleven

MIKE
Yeah Well obviously not always

TRENT
Always baby
MIKE
Im just saying not in this particular
case

TRENT
Always

MIKE
But I lost How can you say always

In the meantime the Bluehair has been dealt an eleven
This captures the swingers attention

BLUEHAIR
Hit

Four Fifteen all together

BLUEHAIR
Oh I dont know Hit

Two Seventeen Dealer has a seven showing

BLUEHAIR
What the hell- hit

Four Twenty one

DEALER
(with a warm smile)
Twenty one

Polite applause from around the table which the Bluehair
humbly waves off Mike looks at Trent Daggers Trent
shrugs

A different PIT BOSS approaches

PIT BOSS
Would you care for some breakfast maam

BLUEHAIR
Well No I shouldnt Maybe later
Thank you though

MIKE
(to Trent under his breath)
Im gonna fuckinkillyou

CUT TO

INT TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - CASHIERS WINDOW - NIGHT

Mike is presented a stack of twenties by the CASHIER who
counts them out Trent looks on

CASHIER

and twenty dollars We hope to see you

(polite smile)

Mike throws her a disgusted look then turns to go Trent
struggles to cheer him up

TRENT

Mike looks away shaking his head in disgust

TRENT

from the wrist like a boxing
champ)
Mikeys the big winner

MIKE
(shaking his head to hide a
smirk)
What an asshole

TRENT
Okay Tees the asshole but Mikeys the
big winner

The same WAITRESS from before approaches the swingers as they
are about to leave

WAITRESS

an hour with that stupid martini on my
tray

MIKE

quickly

CHRISTY

CHRISTY

TRENT

(condescending)

The waitress smiles in spite of herself shakes her head and
walks away

MIKE

CUT TO

INT TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - LANDLUBBER LOUNGE - SAME NIGHT

Christy is at the bar wearing acid-washed jeans with a
matching denim top Shes sexy in a pathetic mid-eighties
sort of way Shes sitting next to a pretty brunette LISA
dressed in a similar fashion

There is something bizarre about her appearance Her hair is
tied into long pig-tails with powder blue ribbons Her
makeup job is almost theatrical with bright pinkred lips
She cant be that out of it or can she

The girls have already been flanked by a herd of potential
COURTIERS

The SWINGERS saunter up to the girls in a smooth SLOW-MOTION
SHOT

The girls notice them

The courtiers sense their rejection and part like the Red Sea
for the swingers in perfect slow-motion choreography

CHRISTY
Hi boys we almost gave up on you

TRENT
Oh are we late There are no clocks in
this town

CHRISTY
Well no harm done This is Lisa Im

wearing an LA Kings home jersey His sweater bears the
sacred number 99 Sue is lounging in front of the TV in
army surplus khaki cutoffs and untied Doc Martin boots

Sue brushes back a shock of straight greasy dirty blonde
hair as not to obscure his view of the screen His face
glows with the reflection of the SEGA HOCKEY game on the set
Sue and TRENT are locked in a heavily contested battle of
motor reflexes Nothing moves but their eyes thumbs and
mouths

sporting event than the Clippers game on the TV across the

Sue dives onto Trent They wrestle a little too
rambunctiously for indoors Trent pulls the hockey sweater
over Sues head and starts wailing on his back

wearing baggy slacks Doc Martin shoes and an oversized
Eisenhower-cut jacket with a vertical stripe inset The
collar is large and pointy but definitely not seventies
His ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe

Rob hasnt been at it quite as long Hes wearing worn-in
Levies over worn-in boots and the nineties standby an
untucked flannel

Mike walks with purpose He intermittently tries to pull
open locked steel doors along the alley Rob looks confused

ROB
So if the party starts at eight why are
we first going to a bar at ten

MIKE
To get a drink before we meet the guys
for a bite at eleven

ROB
Oh
(beat)

Where is this place

MIKE
(pulling handle)
Its one of these For some reason cool
bars in LA have to be very hard to find
and have no signs out front

ROB
That doesnt sound too good for business

MIKE

(pull)
Its kinda like a speakeasy kind of
thing Its kinda cool Its like
youre in on some kind of secret You
tell a chick youve been some place its
like bragging that you know how to find
it The only way you could know where a
place is is if someone who knows brought
you there You have to have someone come
before There is a direct line
connecting you back to the original
unequivocally cool club patrons Its
kinda like Judaism

ROB
Sounds more like Aids

MIKE
Thats probably a more appropriate
analogy

At this point they come upon an unmarked BLACK METAL DOOR
which Mike successfully pulls open to reveal

several round padded booths lining the walls The place is

are observing two HOT GIRLS at another cocktail table

The girls are wearing short plaid skirts with black stockings

pulled up to midthigh Its the catholic-school-girl-gone-
bad look

The girls are a little too touchy-feely with each other
suggesting a certain sexual open-mindedness

TRENT

trail

SUE

TRENT

false ts worth the risk

MIKE

They cross to the ladies
Mikes POV

The girls seem at first cold the receptive Trent and Sue
join their table and share some laughs

Mike half-heartedly looks on He is obviously not happy with
where he stands on the bell-curve of masculinity

Mike looking for any kind of escape crosses to the bar

CUT TO
INT BAR - DRESDEN ROOM - SAME
Mike unsuccessfully tries to catch the attention of the
middle aged BARTENDER

MIKE

BLONDE

Mike notices the bartender who has been waiting patiently
with the drink

apologetically

Mike nods and energized by the bombardment crosses back to
the bar and right into the fray

Trent and Sue rejoin the other swingers

Swingers POV of Mike decisively engaging her in
conversation

She laughs
Out comes the pen and the cocktail napkin Bingo

Mike crosses back to the swingers table and using his body
to shield Nikkis view pretends to rip the napkin This
breaks the guys up

Mike sits down and after admiring the blotchy numerals
delicately folds the napkin and pockets it

TRENT
See baby Its not that hard

SUE

A BALD GUY with a goatee brushes by Sue

BALD GUY

SUE

Thats it Now theyre squaring off in the empty parking
lot

All the bald guys boys fall in behind him All the swingers
fall in behind Sue The swingers are not happy with Sue at
all

The two cliques contrast each other in every way

The bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced
extremities with the odd neck-tattoo thrown in for good
measure

Baggy denim and boots Pot leaves and Pumas Long heavy
key chains Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta They do
however look big and mean next to our boys

The early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over
button down shirts and tapered slacks dont quite have the
same fear factor but the boys do look classy

The word bitch is growled out by the two of them a half
dozen more times until

Sue pulls a PISTOL out of his belt
Everyone is SCARED Especially the swingers

SUE
Now what bitch Now whos the bitch

The bald guys HOLD UP THEIR HANDS and slowly back up to their

INT THE DERBY - HOLLYWOOD NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

They enter the domed decco lounge and the full house parts
for them and greets them in perfect Scorsese choreography

They pass the billiard table and the circular brass rail bar

The six piece swing band decked out in zoot suits wail on
stage as the crowded dance floor whirls

The swingers eventually settle into a dark curtained-off
onstage booth

Sue thrusts a scotch into Mikes hand

BRUNETTE

attractive enough to dance with

MIKE
Yes I mean no I mean maybe he would
find her I mean you attractive Maybe
he doesnt like to dance Maybe all he
likes to do is just stand around and
drink and smoke and look cool with his
buddies who dont dance either

BRUNETTE
Maybe it doesnt matter if hes a good
dancer cause its a slow song if thats
what hes afraid of

MIKE
(smirk)

place She belongs on the nose of a B-52 What can he say

He awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor
They START TO DANCE Its a slow song and they boringly rock
back and forth Mike is self-conscious but her touch Oh
her touch

CUT TO
Trent and Sue watching in disbelief
SUE
It is on
TRENT

BACK TO

The couples dance is cut short as there were only a few bars
left of the slow ballad Mike smiles politely in relief and
begins to lead Lorraine off the floor

She pulls him back Hes not getting off that easy She
wants a whole song He politely holds her poised for
another slow number Theyre alone on the floor

Much to Mikes dismay the song begins with a DRIVING TOM TOM
SOLO This cues every hep cat in the Derby that the big
ones coming They all flood the floor for the last dance of
the night
Mike pleadingly shakes his head at Lorraine Its too fast
Her eyes narrow as her grip tightens No sympathy here

The band breaks into the full-tilt swing number and the dance
floor writhes around them

They stand motionless for what seems like an eternity
Gut check Fuck it Sink or swim

Mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman Its just a simple
six-count swing step but theyre in perfect harmony

Mike and Lorraine look into each others eyes Its on baby
As Mikes courage grows the moves start to flow A spin at
first Then a double twirl Its not long before hes
throwing her through combinations that stand out even among
the pros
CUT TO

Trent and Sue mouths agape

BACK TO
Mike is whipping her smoothly through violent-looking
combinations without a trace of hesitation and boy can she

follow

The set ends with a flourishing crescendo Theyre frozen in
a final dip panting through a glaze of clean sweat

Mike and Lorraine smile and look into each others eyes The
smile slowly disappears Will they kiss

Theyre close

Really close

Lips almost touching

Mike tries to muster-up the courage but its been so long
He cant do it He lets her up

The floor clears Exhausted dancers push past them Forget
it The moments gone

What the hell They had a great time Whats the hurry

understand why none of the clubs in
Hollywood have signs Anyway Im so bad
at this if youre not busy I thought you

Mike smiles as the CAMERA PULLS BACK from the window and
backwards down Franklin Avenue in a reverse of the first shot
of the movie The soundtrack kicks in with Sinatras Heres
To The Losers

FRANK
Heres to those who love not too wisely
no not too wisely but too well
To the girl who sighs with envy when she
hears that wedding bell
To the guy whod throw a party if he knew
someone to call
Heres to the losers Bless them all

We rise and pass the glowing Hollywood sign Its still a
full moon
FRANK
Heres to those who drink their dinners
when that lady doesnt show
To the girls who wait for kisses
underneath that mistletoe
To the lonely summer lovers when the
leaves begin to fall
Heres to the losers Bless them all

Past the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records
building

FRANK
Hey Tom Dick and Harry
Come in out of the rain
Those torches you carry
Must be drowned in champagne

Up and over Hollywood Boulevard High above the city

FRANK
Heres the last toast of the evening
Heres to those who still believe
All the losers will be winners
All the givers shall receive
Heres to trouble-free tomorrows
May your sorrows all be small
Heres to the losers Bless them all

Its all just a pool of beautiful golden light
