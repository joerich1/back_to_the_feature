YOUNGBLOOD
For Thine is the Kingdom
For Thine is the Kingdom

Nervous looks from the rest of the Squad as they turn their
attention from the two shallow graves to the hulking Young-
blood -- He continues to stare abstractly at his feet

ATWATER
For Thine is the Kingdom and
the Power and the Glory forever
Amen

Youngblood raises his look to the graves

YOUNGBLOOD
We give this prayer as dead men
asking for our own salvation

Norman steps into the center of the clearing standing before

sition or his strength He may

terrain but we have the advan-
tage of military training
Remember the 5 Ds Detect

ATWATER
Great speech Norman But I

He can see the rest of the Squad sleeping The dark forest
surrounding allA twig cracks in the bushafter a moment

Calvelli starts to move quietly not waking any of the others

Calvelli now travels through the underbrush to the edge of
the bayou where he sees

MASTERSON

holding the Trappers head under water The Cajun is on
his stomach a rope ties’ his arms behind his back -- Master-
son lets his head up momentarily then pushes it back into
the muddy water The Trapper goes under spitting bubbles

CALVELLI

him up by the hair The Trapper surfaces lungs bursting
for air

MASTERS ON

SUNDAY NIGHT
Masterson shoves the Trapper back in

In a flash Calvellis right hand slashes out - the switch-
blade cutting along Mastersons ponchoa warning slash

MASTERSON
Thats the second time you pulled
that on me ‘

Masterson takes out his bayonet The long blade glistens in
the night rain

Calvelli backs away

Masterson keeps coming

Slashslash

Calvelli has no choice The two men circle

CALVELLI
Okay you got it

Masterson lunges for the gut Calvelli takes the feint and
leans back as Masterson continues the thrust upwards barely
raking Calvelli from jaw to cheek A fine line of blood
seeps out of the razored cut Masterson smiles

They circle each other feinting for an opening Mastersons
bayonet cutting circles through the falling rain

Calvellis left hand grabs Mastersons right wrist in mid
air pulling it sideways pitching Masterson off balance
Calvelli pounces the two men go down each holding the
others knife wrist

ROLLING IN THE MUD
Once twice On the third roll the flash of the Cajun
Trapper coming to his feet breaks Calvellis concentration

For a moment their eyeballs lock

They roll over again Calvelli on top on bottom on top
again Loses the switchblade

‘His leverage has Mastersons wrist bent backwards forcing

the bayonet from Mastersons grip They roll over and come
apart

Each man up quickly each dives for the blade lost in the

mud

Calvelli now has the bayonet Masterson now has the switch-
blade

Masterson lunges Catches Calvelli off guard Calvelli
throws his left arm up to block the stab The switchblade

plunges into the lower flesh of Calvellis bicep and sticks

Calvellis knife hand lashes up misses but his knuckles
catch Masterson flush on the jaw a solid right hook
Masterson stumbles backwards leaving the switchblade stuck
in Calvellis arm

ACROSS THE WAY

Norman Atwater Wilson come running up through the under-
brush Stop and stare at the two struggling men

CALVELLI

leaps -on top of Masterson they both go down hard
Masterson on his back Calvelli on top of him

Calvellis left wrist is pressed tight under Mastersons jaw
pinning him gagging him Calvellis shaking right hand
holds the bayonet shoulder highMasterson is totally vul-
nerable his empty arms stretched out in surrendertotally
at Calvellis mercy

Calvelli brings the bayonet up higher

Then plunges it deep into Mastersons heart

-The sound of laughter

Calvelli keeps leaning on the bayonetAll his weight
Then slowly comes back up staring at the dead man beneath
him

He cant believe what hes done Cant believe it But
its there Staring up at him He did this With his
own hand

Calvelli gets to his feet

Sees the shocked faces of Atwater Norman and Wilson dis-
covering for the first time that theyve been watching

running through the swamp Never looking back he dodges and
darts cutting and weaving through the towering ferns

Eyes and lungs on fire he staggers through the thicket and
muddoubles over holding his side breathing like a loco-

rinsing and spitting then forces himself onRunning again
then trips recovers scrambling now on all fours knees not
touching the earthHe pitches forward and drops exhausted
shaking afraid to move

They move up a steep embankment cross through a ridge of
ferns and begin a descent toward a new series of bayous and
interlocking waterways The maze of brackish water and
dense foliage stretches before them like a vast crossword
puzzlebeyond lies a forest of dead trees leafless

branches pointing upward almost in surrender

eration of mud and branches

ATWATER

Atwater goes to the dark mound kicks it waits then warily
kicks it again Suddenly an explosion of mud and water as

a small alligator thunders out of its nest and into the reeds
beyondAtwater watches it go then reaches inside the nest
and hands Calvelli a large leathery egg He reaches back
inside and pulls out two more gives one to Youngblood
Atwater stands holding one in his hand

sleeping heavily exhaustedCalvelli in a sentry position
fatigue has taken its toll with him as well -- he sleeps

TUESDAY MORNING
fitfullyYoungblood nowhere to be seen

The ground begins to shake a roaring noiseCalvelli awakens
as the sound and shaking increaseThen suddenly from fifty
yards away a train whistle blastsfrom out of nowhere a
locomotive and flatcars roar by at seventy miles an hour

The railroad embankment obscured from Calvelii’ s vision by
the dense foliage

Atwater leaps to Calvellis side They both run toward the
embankment shouting to each other above the roar

ATWATER
Where the fuck did this come from

CALVELLI
I dont know but I love it

Big smiles on both mens faces they slap five

After a few moments the end of the train whips by

ATWATER AND CALVELLI
Maintaining their smiles

ATWATER
Never been so glad

The eyes of both men tighten

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACK

Youngbloods body hanging from the limb of a cypress tree
the rope that Atwater bound him with now forms a hangmans’
noose

The Elderly Man smiles nervously back at the two disheveled
soldiers The Woman doesnt smile at all

A very long pause
Atwater and Calvelli so moved by their first contact with

civilization that words are difficultAtwater notices the
reluctance of the couple
