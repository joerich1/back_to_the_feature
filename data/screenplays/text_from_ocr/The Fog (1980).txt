One more story before twelve just
to keep us warn

Suddenly Machens hand grabs the watch and SNAPS it shut
The children jump their eyes staring at the watch and then
flicking up to the face of ARTHUR MACHEN

CLOSEUP - ARTHUR MACHEN

He is a large round man He has a full white beard and
wears a sea captains cap Dressed in a fading navy blue
pea jacket he wears a white ivory whales tooth on a chain
around his neck Machen is an old fisherman who looks

appropriately ominous for the children as he is lit by the
firelight

MACHEN (CONTD)
In five minutes it will be the twenty-
first of April One hundred years ago
on the twenty-firsc of April out there
on the water by Spivey Point a small
clipper ship drew towards land It was
said that the men on board all twenry
of them were rich and carried a great
chalice of gold in their hold They were
coming here to Antonic Bay to start a new
home But as they pulled closer and closer
to shore suddenly
out of the night the fog rolled in a thick
vaporous shroud that covered the ship
obscuring the shoreline and the bonfire
that the town had set to guide them safely
past the breakers For a moment they could
see nothing not a foot in front of them but
then one or them saw a light through the fog
By God it was a fire burning on the shore
strong enough to penetrate the swirling mist
They steered a course toward the light

Machen glances down at the flickering fire

MACHEN (CONTD)
but it was a campfire like
this one built by someone down the
beach from the main bonfire

(CONTD)

ANGLE ON CHILDREN
They stare in guilty horror at the fire in frone of them

MACHEN (CONTD)
The campfire guided chem toward
Spivey Point the wrong way toward ©
the breakers

ANGLE ON MACHEN

MACHEN (CONTD)
The ship crashed against the rocks
Its hull sheared in two The masc
snapped like a twig The wreckage
sank with all the men on board clawing
and gasping for air as the black ocean
closed in around them Ar the bortom of
the sea lay the Elizabeth Dane and her
men their lungs filled with salt water
their eyes open and staring in the
darkness And up above as suddenly as it
Had come the fog lifted receeded back
across the ocean and never came again
But it is told by the fishermen and their
fathers and grandfathers that when the
fog returns to Antonio Bay the men at the
bottom of the waters off Spivey Point will
rise up and search for that campfire that
lead them to their dark icy death

ANGLE ON CHILDREN

‘Terrified they just stare at the fire There is a hushed

silence Just the flickering HISS of the flames

Suddenly a CHURCH BELL BLASTS open the silence GONG The
children jump and GASP their eyes wide

He smiles at the children and glances at his watch

MACHEN -
Twelve oclock April the twenty-

CAMERA SLOWLY BOOMS UP from Machens face up through the

Slowly we are aware of somethin ving across the water
in foreground It is the bading edge of a dense fogbank
drifting slowly toward Antonio Bay

Finally the fog completely obscures the lights in the
distance Silence The LAPPING of ocean water and
another distant GONG

Then suddenly a black clawing hand EXPLODES through the
Suecen— Crawing Nand barLubns through the
surface of the water

It is caked with slime and twisted with seaweed The
hand REACHES RIGHT AT CAMERA COVERING THE LENS
plunging us into BLACKNESS
