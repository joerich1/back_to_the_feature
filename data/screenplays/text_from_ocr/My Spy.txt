INT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

We open on KEVIN BLUSKI He’s 17 rail-thin gangly and
awkward He’s breathing hard Vibrating with nervous energy

COACH (0S)
I want you to remember this moment
Remember the way it feels Because
one day you’1ll look back and
realize this was the most important
night of your entire life

A ROAR of approval Kevin SCREAMS louder than anyone

And without warning we CUT AWAY TO

INT LEO’S MANSION - SIMULTANEOUS

An upper class soiree Socialites press flesh and exchange
air kisses The room practically reeks of money

The crowd parts for LEO KEARNEY He’s intense Impeccably
dressed Teeth polished to a gleaming white

But all eyes are on the brunette hanging off his arm

VANESSA CROSS 29 Graceful Poised The sort of smile that
knocks the wind right out of you

MR DUMA approaches Leo The massive bodyguard looks like a
shaved grizzly bear stuffed into a midget’s tuxedo

MR DUMA
Leo got a second

LEO
What is it

Mr Duma murmurs something Leo turns to Vanessa

LEO
I gotta take this babe Do me a
favor go find that Cuban kid in
the kitchen tell him to refill the
foie gras or I’1ll put his whole
family back on a boat

Vanessa forces a smile Lets Leo kiss her on the cheek
Watches as he follows Mr Duma out of the room
Then her smile vanishes

INT LEO’S MANSION - BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER
Vanessa locks the bathroom door behind her

She opens the window--

EXT LEOS MANSION - ROOF

And smoothly vaults onto the narrow ledge waiting outside

It’s a 20 foot drop to the pavement below

She sidles down the ledge stepping carefully in her high
heels Fingertips brushing the wall for balance

She reaches Leo’s study halting just outside the window
She fishes a make-up compact from her handbag flips it open

Vanessa presses a hidden button and the compact’s mirror
flickers becoming an LCD video screen Whoa

She angles the edge of the compact around the windowsill
From Vanessa’s perspective we see Leo talking in pantomime
with a short chubby man This is DALE HARKISS

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

An unmarked van is parked on the street outside the mansion

INT MARSKY’S VAN -— CONTINUOUS

Inside the van THREE CIA AGENTS are monitoring Vanessas
live feed on a row of video screens

AGENT MARSKY is clearly running the show EDDIE is behind the
wheel keeping an eye on the street LYNN is filtering an
image of Harkiss through her facial recognition software

Harkiss’s government ID badge appears on Lynn’s screen

LYNN
We’ve got a match Dale Harkiss

Marsky picks up a headset
MARSKY
Vanessa do you copy

We INTERCUT between the van and--

EXT LEO’S MANSION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS
Vanessa touches one of her earrings A two-way communicator

VANESSA
(quietly)
Copy

MARSKY
We’ve got ID Name’s Harkiss
Department of Defense analyst

VANESSA
Hang on
(She angles the camera)
I’ve got visual on the disc

Now we CUT BACK to our previous scene still in progress

INT LOCKER ROOM —- SIMULTANEOUS
Sweat beads on Kevin’s brow Ready to kick some ass

COACH (0S)
Youre greek gods You’re Vikings
riding out for battle YOU ARE
WARRIORS

INT LEO’S STUDY - SIMULTANEOUS

Harkiss hands Leo an unmarked CD in a jewel case Watches as
Leo pops the disc into his computer

HARKISS
The program is access only so
dont try copying any files

LEO
(icily)
Mr Harkiss do you really think
I’m trying to cheat you

HARKISS

(a nervous laugh)
Course not
Leo launches the program Onscreen the word DEUS appears
followed by a verification prompt appears

LEO
It’s asking for a passcode

Harkiss hands him an index card We glimpse a complicated 28-
digit string of letters and numbers written in magic marker

HARKISS
Don’t lose that Deus won’t work
without it
Leo punches in the code--
The program blazes to life We see a grid of pop-up boxes
data flowing too fast to read totally overwhelming
INT MARSKY’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

Inside the van the agents are freaking out

LYNN
He’s accessing the program

MARSKY
Shit We may need to intercept
EXT LEO’S MANSION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS
Vanessa doesn’t like what she’s hearing
VANESSA
Intercept with what You see any

place to hide a gun in this dress

MARSKY (0S)
We don’t have a choice

Vanessa takes a deep breath This is going to get messy

INT LEO’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Leo examines the scrolling boxes curiously Positions his
cursor over an icon that reads LAUNCH

Watching him Harkiss clears his throat
HARKISS
I wouldn’t do that Not unless you
wanna get real popular in a hurry
EXT LEO’S MANSION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Outside Vanessa is preparing to wrench open the window--

MARSKY (0S)
Wait

Vanessa glances at the video screen in her hand

We see that Leo has closed the Deus program He ejects the
disc from the computer

Vanessa exhales slowly That was too close

INT LEO’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
Leo drops a bulky black duffel bag onto the desk

Harkiss unzips the bag revealing an obscene amount of
bundled hundred dollar bills He gulps

The door opens to reveal Mr Duma lugging a large plastic
tarp behind him He unrolls the tarp toward Harkiss

MR DUMA
‘Scuse me

Harkiss steps aside Confused

EXT LEO’S MANSION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS
Outside the window Vanessa realizes what’s happening

VANESSA
Are you seeing this

MARSKY (0S)
Yeah

VANESSA
Do you want me to intercept

Inside Mr Duma has finished unrolling the tarp

VANESSA
Repeat should I intercept
When Marsky speaks again he sounds flustered Uncertain
MARSKY (0S)
Umno No hold your position
Harkiss isn’t worth it

Vanessa looks unhappy but she obeys the order

INT LEO’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
Harkiss glances at the tarp Chuckles nervously

HARKISS
Whatwhat’s with the plastic

LEO
Come on Mr Harkiss That’s an
80000 carpet you’re standing on

And on that beat we CUT BACK TO

INT LOCKER ROOM —- SIMULTANEOUS
The coach’s VOICE has risen to a frothing crescendo

COACH (0S)
And what do warriors do

EVERYONE
KILL KILL KILL

Kevin chants along with the rest Murder in his eyes

INT LEO’S STUDY - SIMULTANEOUS

Mr Duma steps behind Harkiss Pulls a silenced pistol from

his jacket Aims at the back of Harkiss’s skull

EXT LEOS MANSION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

THWIP Vanessa flinches at the sound of the silenced gunshot

After a beat Marsky’s voice comes over the communicator
MARSKY (0S)

There was nothing we could have
done
VANESSA
We both know that’s not true

She snaps her compact shut Edges away from the window

INT MARSKY’S VAN -— CONTINUOUS

The video screen goes dark Marsky nods to Eddie

MARSKY
Get us out of here

EDDIE
You got it

INT LEOS MANSION - MINUTES LATER
Leo returns to the party Glances around for Vanessa
And she’s right there Not a hair out of place

VANESSA
What took you so long

LEO
You know Business

He takes her by the waist and leads her into the crowd

INT LOCKER ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Kevin looks up sharply as the coach calls his name

COACH (0S)
Bluski

KEVIN
Here

COACH (0S)
Take us out

Kevin nods grimly
Then he puts on the pig’s head

We PULL BACK to reveal that Kevin is dressed as OINKY the

costumed mascot of the Smithback High Warthogs
EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

Oinky leads the charge onto the football field The crowd
goes wild as the players begin to emerge

Oinky hops up and down flapping his arms

KEVIN
WOOO LET’S GO WARTHOGS

WHOMP One of the football players--DARREN--barrels past
deliberately clipping Oinky’s shoulder Hard

KEVIN
Sorry about that Go get ‘em

Now two more players drum their hands against Oinky’s plastic
head Inside the costume Kevin grimaces

A few more players elbow past each one taking care to knock
the mascot off-balance or slap his head for good luck

KEVIN
(weakly)
Let’s go team

A group of BURNOUTS start jeering him from the bleachers

BURNOUT 1
Hey Oinky

Oinky turns toward them Strikes a playful pose

BURNOUT 1
YOURE A FAG

Oinky’s shoulders slump The burnouts high-five each other

EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - MONTAGE

We glimpse highlights from the rest of the night

--Oinky urges the crowd to perform The Wave They ignore him
--A RECEIVER is driven off the field flattening Oinky in the
process A dozen bystanders help the player back to his feet
Nobody offers Oinky a hand

--A soda cup comes whizzing from the stands and ricochets off
Oinky’s head A bunch of teenagers howl with laughter
EXT STARBUCKS —- LATE NIGHT

Vanessa approaches the coffee shop Even at this late hour
the place is still packed with caffeine fiends

Eddie is standing watch outside He makes eye contact as she
passes and gives her an almost imperceptible nod

Vanessa purchases a coffee and enters the outdoor patio

Lynn is sitting at one of the tables She stands and casually
strolls away Vanessa takes the seat she just vacated

At the next table Marsky pretends to read the newspaper
VANESSA
(without looking at him)
Did you get it

MARSKY
Under your chair

Vanessa reaches below the table and picks up the shopping bag
that Lynn left behind

MARSKY
Intel says the buyers are coming in
late tomorrow We have to move

VANESSA
I’1l need to disappear Fast

MARSKY
We can make that happen

VANESSA
Tomorrow 10 o’clock The safehouse
on Grover Don’t make me wait

Shouldering the bag she exits the cafe without another word

Once she’s safely around the corner Vanessa reaches into the
bag and takes out the item inside

It’s a tiny bottle of nail polish

Satisfied she slips it into her purse Keeps walking

EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - LATE NIGHT

Kevin exits the locker room costume slung over his shoulder

The crowd has dispersed The bleachers are empty save for

FLOWER CHO The coolest chick in school whether she knows it
or not She’s rocking a homemade outfit that’s a cross
between Haight-Ashbury and an anime samurai princess

FLOWER
Kevin

KEVIN
Hey Flower

FLOWER
You were good out there tonight
You know like convincingly piggy

Kevin smiles His puppydog adoration is painfully obvious

EXT SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
They cross the empty parking lot together

KEVIN
Soyou going to Homecoming

FLOWER
(laughing)
Right Can’t you totally see me in
a formal dress Something Barbie
pink with lots of shitty ribbons

Kevin forces a grin Trying to summon the courage to ask her
to the dance He gets as far as opening his mouth

Then he promptly chickens out He just can’t do it
FLOWER
We’re still on for tomorrow right

Help the dumb girl with Algebra

KEVIN
You’re not dumb

FLOWER
Tell that to Algebra

Here goes nothing
KEVIN

What are you doing tonight We
could I dunno do something

But at that moment a car full of COOL KIDS pulls up One of
them DANA calls out to Flower

DANA
Hey you coming

Flower glances at Kevin She seems genuinely apologetic
FLOWER
Oh I kinda already promised the

girls wed hang out

Kevin tries to pretend like he doesn’t care But acting-wise
he’s no Brando More like Ice Cube

KEVIN
No that’s cool

FLOWER
Some other time

KEVIN
Totally

DANA

Flower come on

Flower hurries toward Dana’s car Kevin watches her go

INT KEVIN’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Kevin enters lugging the Oinky costume under one arm

His mother CAROLINE is on the couch opening the mail

CAROLINE
Hey hon How was the game
KEVIN
(glumly)
Same as always
CAROLINE
Did you ask her to Homecoming
KEVIN
(instantly evasive)
Ask who
CAROLINE

Don’t play dumb Flower

Kevin rolls his eyes embarrassed beyond words

KEVIN
I’m so not talking about this

CAROLINE
I’m just saying you need to ask
her before someone else does
KEVIN
Look it’s just weird okay We’ve
been friends for like ten years
CAROLINE
Friends can go to a dance together
That’s how these things start
KEVIN
Nothing’s starting This is the
opposite of starting

CAROLINE
Stopping

KEVIN
It’s nothing Okay Not happening

Caroline shrugs but she still looks skeptical

INT LEOS MANSION - MIDNIGHT

Vanessa stands before the bay window staring out into the
night She looks worried

No worse than that She looks scared
Leo appears in the doorway behind her

LEO
Coming to bed

Vanessa takes a beat to compose herself then turns Smiles
VANESSA
Yeah
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING
Kevin strolls down the hallway He’s laughing and joking with

a group of SIMILARLY NERDY FRIENDS It’s like West Side
Story only with more acne and less finger-snapping

The other students ignore the cluster of roving geeks Kevin
and his friends might as well be invisible

One by one the other geeks peel away heading off to
separate classrooms Kevin continues on alone

A group of TOUGH-LOOKING GANGBANGERS are loitering by the
lockers They scowl at Kevin

Kevin avoids eye contact as he hurries past

He approaches Flower who is hanging out with Dana and the
other cool kids Kevin raises his hand weakly

Flower sees him breaks into a smile--
Kevin hesitates Should he interrupt the Circle of Coolness

Then he loses his nerve Keeps walking head down

INT LEOS STUDY - MORNING

Vanessa slips into the study leaving the door cracked behind
her She hurriedly searches Leo’s desk

No luck The disc isn’t there
She opens the closet Slides a file cabinet aside revealing--
A HIDDEN SAFE

She opens her handbag and takes out the bottle of nail polish
that Lynn left for her Uncaps it

Suddenly FOOTSTEPS echo in the hall behind her

Vanessa freezes Holding her breath

And the footsteps pass right by the study Whew

Using the applicator she applies several drops of “nail
polish” to the safe’s hinges Instantly the metal begins to

HISS sending up tendrils of smoke It’s some form of acid

Once the hinges have been eaten away Vanessa grasps the
handle and wrenches the door free

Inside the safe is the black duffel bag filled with money
And sitting atop the bag is the Deus computer disc Jackpot

Vanessa opens the disc’s case and removes the index card
containing the passcode She slips the card into her sock

Just in case

INT LEOS MANSION - CONTINUOUS
Vanessa makes her way down the stairs Turns the corner

And comes face-to-face with Leo

LEO
Hey Where you been
VANESSA
Right here
LEO

Huh Couldn’t find you
(noticing her handbag)
You going out
VANESSA
Yeah I’m meeting Amy Coffee and
gossip You want to come
Please say no Please say no

LEO
Nah You go ahead

VANESSA
Okay See you in a bit

She starts for the door Suddenly Leo calls after her
LEO
Hey
(beat)
Love you

Vanessa manages one last smile

INT LEO’S STUDY - MINUTES LATER

Leo enters the study and stops short Sniffs the air
Frowning now he follows the acrid smell across the room
He opens the closet Drags the file cabinet aside

Sees the ruined safe

LEO
No

He rushes to the windowjust in time to see Vanessa’s car
disappear down the driveway

LEO
No No Nonononono
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

The bell RINGS and students pour out of classrooms hurrying
off to swap textbooks or grab a smoke in the parking lot

Kevin emerges from the nearest classroom He’s talking to one
of his GEEKY FRIENDS a hefty kid with glasses

Suddenly Kevin notices

Flower Approaching from the opposite direction She’s busy
talking to Dana and hasn’t noticed Kevin

Time seems to slow to a crawl as they pass each other Kevin
following her with his eyes

WHAM Without warning Kevin runs right into DARREN the
Warthogs’ starting Left Tackle Darren stumbles sloshing the

soda he’s carrying all across his football jersey

Darren whirls around nostrils flaring

DARREN
Bluski

The Geeky Friend takes off like a ham-shaped bullet waddling
as fast as he can leaving Kevin to fend for himself

KEVIN
Oh God Um sorry about that bro--

DARREN
Don’t call me bro dickface Who’s
gonna clean this jersey huh

KEVIN
II wouldn’t worry I bet this
stuff comes right out

DARREN
Oh is that right

And with that Darren dumps the rest of his Big Gulp all over

Kevin’s crotch A taunting smile daring Kevin to fight back
DARREN
Don’t worry bro I heard it comes
right out
Kevin says nothing Looks away miserably

Grinning Darren lumbers off his Alpha Male status asserted

Kevin lingers for a moment trying to hide his sopping wet
crotch Then he makes a beeline for the front door

INT SCHOOL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
MR MULL intercepts Kevin as he passes the front office

MR MULL
Kevin Bluski Decided to set your
own schedule today huh

KEVIN
I’m sorry but I just need to run
home real quick and change--

MR MULL
Got a permission slip
KEVIN
No but--
MR MULL

Then the only place you’re going is
third period Move it buster

Kevin lowers his bookbag revealing his crotch
Mr Mull’s expression softens

MR MULL
Little accident huh

KEVIN
Kind of I guess so

Mr Mull gives him an encouraging pat on the shoulder

MR MULL
Don’t let it get you down Me I
was still having accidents in
college Terrible ones all the
damn time You grow out of it

KEVIN
thanks

MR MULL
Be back before lunch

Kevin gratefully vanishes out the front door

EXT GHETTO NEIGHBORHOOD - LATE MORNING

Vanessa parks her car outside a rundown apartment building

INT SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Vanessa makes her way up the stairwell to the third floor
She tries the door at the end of the hall Unlocked
Vanessa enters the apartment It’s empty Eerie

VANESSA
Marsky

Marsky emerges from the shadows flanked by Eddie and Lynn

Lynn hurries across the room and embraces Vanessa They’re
clearly old friends

LYNN
You rock

VANESSA
Just a little

MARSKY
Did you get the disc

VANESSA
Of course I got it

EDDIE
Hell yeah she did

Eddie gives her a fist pound grinning from ear to ear

Relaxed now Vanessa passes the disc to Marsky--

But this is important she only gives him the disc She keeps
the index card with the passcode hidden in her sock

MARSKY
Knew you could do it

VANESSA
What’s the extraction plan

LYNN
You’re flying out of Burbank How
does Madrid sound

This is music to Vanessa’s ears She grins at her friend

VANESSA
Now who rocks

LYNN
I figured there are worse places to
lay low for a while

MARSKY
It’s a commercial flight though
so hand over your sidearm

Vanessa pulls a handgun from her jeans Passes it to Marsky--

But as he takes it we notice something weird Marsky is
wearing a plastic glove on his right hand

VANESSA
What’s with the glove

MARSKY
Funny story

Marsky turns and shoots Lynn and Eddie BANG BANG baby

Her friends are dead before they hit the floor Vanessa is
too stunned to react

Marsky whirls back around backhanding Vanessa with the butt
of her own gun and the world goes BLACK

INT KEVIN’S CAR - SIMULTANEOUS

Kevin is stuck in traffic He glances at the passenger seat

Oinky’s glassy plastic eyes stare back at him

Kevin sighs Turns onto a side street

INT SAFEHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Vanessa slowly regains consciousness She’s been tied to a
wooden chair hands bound behind her back

Across the room Marsky is hunched over his laptop The
familiar Deus logo is visible onscreen

Marsky notices she’s awake Kneels before her

MARSKY
Good thing I kept you around Looks
like you were holding out on me
(She doesn’t answer)
The program won’t work without a
passcode I know you’ve got it

Her only answer is to spit blood on the floor

MARSKY
You’re really gonna make me torture
you We can’t be adults here

VANESSA
You miserable bastard

MARSKY
Please 30 minutes with Deus and
I’ll have half the Federal Reserve
sitting in private slush funds I’m
gonna spend the rest of my life
drinking coconut rum out of a
Jamaican girl’s belly button This
is the opposite of miserable

VANESSA
They’11 find you

MARSKY
It’s not me they’1l be looking for
That’s your gun over there Your
pretty little fingerprints Hate to
tell you Vanessa but you just
went rogue

Grinning he slaps her lightly on the cheek Approaches the
table Picks up a pair of needle-nosed pliers

MARSKY
So About that torture

He turns back around--

And Vanessa is right there Even still tied to the chair she
somehow crossed the room without making a sound

She headbutts Marsky shattering his nose Then she spins
catching his chin with one of the chair legs

Marsky scrambles for his gun--
Vanessa hops across the room--
Flings herself through the window--
And stops short

The legs of the chair are caught on the window’s frame

Vanessa dangles there high above the street half-in and
half-out She wriggles desperately--

Marsky seizes his gun Rolls sideways Taking aim--
Vanessa flings herself forward one last time--

And one of the chair’s legs CRACKS

EXT OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
vanessa falls

Spinning through the air

Tumbling head over heels

And she slams into the windshield of a passing car

The car promptly skids out of control Screeches to a halt
Now we notice three things

1 Vanessa is dazed Hurt But still alive

2 Except her chair is now embedded in the windshield
Vanessa is essentially sitting on the hood of the car with
her ass through the windshield

3 And the kid behind the wheelis Kevin Bluski

Inside the car Kevin raises his head Coughs

Sees what just happened

KEVIN
WHAT THE SHIT
INT SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Marsky thunders down the stairwell

EXT STREET INT KEVIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Vanessa slowly opens her eyes She’s in pain disoriented
Kevin appears above her staring down with concern

KEVIN
Oh my God I am so sorry

VANESSA
(whispering)
-gun
KEVIN
What
VANESSA

Do youhavea gun

KEVIN
Jesus lady I said I was sorry

But at that moment the safehouse door bangs open and Marsky
spills out his weapon drawn

Vanessa closes her eyes It’s over
Kevin’s gaze swivels from the gunman to the injured woman
And he makes a decision

He leaps behind the wheel Floors the accelerator

As the car lurches forward Vanessa’s eyes snap open again
What the hell is going on

KEVIN
Crap crap crap crap crap

MARSKY
STOP

Marsky takes aim at the fleeing car but he’s a split-second
too late Kevins car disappears around the corner

EXT CITY STREETS INT KEVIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Inside the car Kevin can barely see around Vanessa He
squints through what’s left of the spiderwebbed windshield

KEVIN
I don’t wanna die oh my God
there’s a girl in my windshield and
I’m gonna die

Vanessa cranes her head around just in time to see

A BLACK SEDAN come roaring around the corner after them
Marsky is behind the wheel

VANESSA
Go faster

Kevin stomps on the accelerator and the Protege lurches
forward But the sedan is gaining quickly--

KEVIN
Oh shit Do something

VANESSA
(angrily)
I’m in the windshield

The sedan roars alongside them Kevin glances over and finds
himself staring down the barrel of Marsky’s gun

Panicking he slams on the brakes--

The sedan flashes past--

The sudden momentum shift sends Vanessa skidding forward on
her ass Her arms remain wedged through the windshield but

now her lower body is whipsawing across the hood

VANESSA
What are you doing

KEVIN
I don’t know

He angles the Protege sideways across the median darting
right into oncoming traffic--

Marsky stomps on the brakes sending the sedan into a
controlled skid tires screaming against the pavement--

Kevin swerves past a bus at fifty miles an hour On the hood
Vanessa rocks back and forth like a pendulum
INT CLASSROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Back at the high school a TEACHER is taking attendance
TEACHER
Nancy Beeman
(Nancy says “Here”)
Kevin Bluski
(no response)
Anyone seen Kevin
The teacher sighs Makes a mark in his ledger

Flower frowns at the sight of Kevin’s empty desk

TEACHER
Flower Cho

FLOWER
Oh Here

Flower glances at Kevin’s desk again Where the hell is he

EXT CITY STREETS INT KEVIN’S CAR - SIMULTANEOUS
Kevins car flies through a GAS STATION PARKING LOT
Pedestrians dive for safety as they swerve through the pumps

But the Protege is hopelessly outmatched by the sedan It
pulls alongside them again Marsky taking careful aim--

Kevin sees what’s about to happen and throws himself flat--

BRATATAT Bullets riddle the side of the Protege blowing out
the driver’s side windows

Pressed flat against the floor Kevin SHRIEKS
Oh and by the way nobody is driving the car
They veer toward a row of parked cars Vanessa’s eyes widen

VANESSA
Look out

With a horrible GRINDING noise the Protege shears into the
line of cars kicking up a shower of sparks crumpling
fenders demolishing side mirrors

On the hood Vanessa fights to keep from slipping between the
vehicles Sparks and debris flying in her face

Vanessa feels around behind her back for the steering wheel
She finally locates it twists the wheel counterclockwise

The Protege heaves itself away from the parked cars
careening back into the center of the street

But they’re slowing downthe sedan is catching up again

VANESSA
Accelerator

KEVIN
(still hiding)
What

VANESSA
Pedal on the right

Kevin punches the accelerator

The Protege surges forward Picking up speed

Vanessa is now literally steering the car with her hands tied
behind her back

They’re quickly approaching a busy intersection--

Vanessa blasts right through the intersection Horns BLARE
and tires SQUEAL as the other drivers react

The sedan is almost upon them Marsky won’t miss again

VANESSA
BRAKES

Kevin hits the brakes--
The sedan overshoots their car--

VANESSA
ACCELERATOR

The Protege rockets forward aiming right for the sedan’s
rear bumper They clip the sedan hard--

Marsky CRIES OUT in alarm--

And his sedan plows into a parked car hard enough to lift
the rear wheels clear off the ground WHOMP

Inside the demolished sedan Marsky raises his head just in
time to see the Protege disappear around the corner

Marsky exhales Realizing he’s deeply hopelessly boned

EXT ALLEY - MINUTES LATER

The battered Protege rolls down the alley losing speed
finally bumping to a stop against a garbage dumpster

Kevin tumbles out of the car He’s freaking
Kevin stares at Vanessa
Vanessa stares at Kevin
KEVIN
(can’t hold it in anymore)

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH

VANESSA
Are you finished

KEVIN
(nope)
AAAHHH AAAAAHHH

VANESSA
Hey HEY

Kevin pauses for breath Vanessa tries to calm him down

VANESSA
What’s your name

KEVIN
Kevin

VANESSA

Okay I’m Vanessa

KEVIN
You’re in my windshield

VANESSA
I know that Kevin And now I need
you to untie me Can you do that

Kevin swallows hard Nods his head

He climbs inside the car unties her from the chair helps
her slide free from the ravaged windshield

Vanessa stands on shaky legs She’s battered bleeding from a
dozen tiny cuts on the verge of passing out

She’s also the most beautiful woman this kid has ever seen
She gives Kevin a cursory glance

VANESSA
Sorry about your car

Then she shuffles away Limping Dragging one leg behind her
KEVIN
(blurting it out)
Do you need help

She turns back swaying on her feet

VANESSA
You don’t want to get involved

Then her eyes roll back and she topples to the ground

INT KEVIN’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

Vanessa’s eyelids flutter She’s slumped in the passenger
seat of Kevin’s car still half-unconscious

And Kevin is pulling into the emergency entrance of the
NORTHRIDGE MEDICAL CENTER Uh-oh

She grips Kevin’s wrist with surprising strength

VANESSA
No Nohospitals

KEVIN
Listen lady you’re hurt--

VANESSA
(desperately)
I’m with the CIA
This shuts Kevin up Fast

KEVIN
Whoa Like a spy

VANESSA
You leave me herethey’11l find
mekill meyou can’t

But the effort is too much for her and she passes out again
Her hand falls away from Kevin’s wrist

A pair of orderlies exit the hospital approach the car--
Kevin looks from the orderlies to the mystery woman sitting
beside him Trying to decide what to do

INT KEVIN’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Vanessa Slowly opens her eyes

And finds herself staring at the plastic Oinky mask

She sits up in bed and takes in Kevin’s bedroom

Action figures are arranged on the dresser The walls are
covered with comic book posters

Then she pulls the bedsheet away to reveal that she’s wearing
a Lord of the Rings t-shirt that’s basically one giant image
of Frodo’s face
VANESSA
You gotta be shitting me
INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Vanessa exits Kevin’s bedroom Drags herself down the hall

INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vanessa stumbles into the bathroom Lifts up her shirt and
examines her injured back in the mirror

The wounds have been cleaned Sterilized Bandaged

Kevin appears He immediately looks embarrassed at the sight
of Vanessa’s bra He turns away COUGHS loudly

VANESSA
Youre that kid Calvin

KEVIN
Kevin

VANESSA
Did you do all of this
KEVIN
Yeah
VANESSA
Why
KEVIN

I dunno What was I supposed to do
leave you in that alley

VANESSA
Why not

KEVIN
Because you needed help

Vanessa looks surprisingly touched by his response Maybe
there’s more to this scrawny geek than she first thought

VANESSA
Thank you
INT LEO’S STUDY - AFTERNOON
Leo paces frantically barking orders into the phone
LEO
What do you mean “can’t find

Mr Duma enters the room Clears his throat

MR DUMA

All the blood drains from Leo’s face
LEO
Hell
INT LEO’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS
Leo hurries downstairs carrying the duffel bag full of cash

Three MIDDLE-EASTERN MEN in business suits are waiting in the

HAMIR

Perhaps we did not make ourselves
clear My employer is not a patient
man He does not wait for others
And he certainly does not wait for
someone who has already taken forty
million dollars to perform what
seems to be a very simple task

Leo swallows hard The crazed look of a cornered animal
He unzips the duffel bag revealing stacks of 100 bills

LEO
You want your money back I can do
that Look two million bucks
right here And I can get you the
rest of it just as soon as--

HAMIR
(interrupting)
Do you know what your lower
intestine looks like when it is
extracted from the body

LEO
(beat)
No Can’t say that I do

HAMIR
Because that is just the start of
what will be a very bad very long
weekend for you Mr Kearney

LEO
Come on You can’t just come into
my home and make threats--

HAMIR
For forty million dollars you
would be surprised what we can do

INT KEVIN’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

license plate he will soon

Kevin looks like he just swallowed a live hedgehog

KEVIN
Why would he want me

can’t afford any loose ends
(She softens )
Don’t worry Once you’re in our
custody he won’t be able to touch

into the phone We INTERCUT between the park and--

EXT GRIFFITH PARK — CONTINUOUS

Kevin emerges from one of the public restrooms He glances
down the hill just in time to see--

SEVEN BLACK SEDANS screeching to a halt GOVERNMENT AGENTS
begin to pile out of the cars

Kevin whistles the theme from The X-Files under his breath

Suddenly Kevin’s phone RINGS and we INTERCUT BETWEEN--

Caroline is behind the counter ringing up customers’ checks
while talking on her cell phone in hushed angry tones

the pay phones on the other side of the park

KEVIN
I’mat school

I’m kind of running an errand

And for the first time Kevin gets a good look at the agent
calling the shots

Kevin watches helplessly as the agents converge on Vanessa

Shes a sitting duck

with his mom covering the receiver with one hand

GORDON

KEVIN
Get out I need your car

Stunned Gordon slowly climbs out of the car

GRANNY
Gordon

Kevin hops behind the wheel He still hasn’t noticed the
passenger sitting behind him

EXT GRIFFITH PARK — SIMULTANEOUS

The agents are closing in on Vanessa’s position Marsky
murmurs into his headset coordinating the efforts

MARSKY
Suspect is armed and extremely
dangerous Our first priority is
keeping her away from hostages
(beat)
If she resists take her down

They crest the hill and spot Vanessa Marsky smiles

MARSKY
We got visual All units move in

Vanessa sees the agents coming and stands
Then she sees Marsky Realizes this isn’t an extraction
It’s an execution

She whirls in a circle looking for an escape route but now
she’s surrounded Agents coming out of the woodwork

MARSKY
She’s getting ready to bolt
Weapons free Weapons free

The agents draw their firearms--

But at that moment the Volvo blows past Marsky

Startled agents dive for cover--

The Volvo screeches to a stop beside Vanessa She dives
through the open window without hesitation

VANESSA
Go Go

Kevin floors it The Volvo fishtails wildly tires digging
furrows in the grass before lurching forward again

Marsky sprints after them screaming
MARSKY
SHOOT THEM SHOOT THEM
INT GRANNY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Kevin angles the Volvo between two agents who open fire as
the vehicle races past

the window She touches the hole wonderingly

The Volvo plunges through the park scattering joggers
tearing through bushes and hopping curbs

VANESSA
Where are you going

EXT GRIFFITH PARK - CONTINUOUS

Now the Volvo careens down a steep incline Crashing through
the forest Picking up speed

INT GRANNY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Branches slap against the windshield They’re driving blind

KEVIN
Aaaaah I don’t wanna die

In the backseat Granny seems to find this endlessly amusing
They blast through another chain-link fence--

Rocket up a sharp incline--

And launch into the air

In SLOW-MOTION the Volvo soars out of the forest--

INT GRANNY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Inside the car Kevin and Vanessa are SCREAMING

GRANNY

EXT LOS ANGELES ZOO - MONKEY ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS

The Volvo slams to a stop They’ve landed in a man-made
enclosure Sun-bleached rocks surrounded by a green moat

And the place is full of monkeys

Whoops They just crashed into the Los Angeles Zoo

The monkeys are HOOTING in alarm Miraculously none of the
little shit-flingers were crushed beneath the Volvo

On the walkway above the enclosure TOURISTS stare at them
with naked amazement One by one they raise their cameras
and start snapping pictures

INT GRANNY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Kevin and Vanessa look around bewildered

KEVIN
Oh hey Monkeys

A monkey leaps onto the hood and starts SCREECHING at them

Vanessa turns to the backseat--

And finds Granny LAUGHING so hard she can’t even speak Tears
rolling down her cheeks

VANESSA
We really would like to apologize

KEVIN
We don’t kidnap people on like a
regular basis or anything
Still laughing Granny waves the apology away
GRANNY
(mimicking Kevin)
“I don’t want to die”

She collapses into gales of laughter again

EXT LOS ANGELES ZOO - MONKEY ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS

Kevin and Vanessa leave Granny in the car and cross the
enclosure They quickly pull themselves onto the walkway

The tourists are still ogling them Snapping pictures

VANESSA
What are you looking at

She grabs Kevin’s arm and drags him down the path

In the distance they spot several SECURITY GUARDS racing
toward the monkey enclosure Kevin falters--

But Vanessa grabs his arm Keeps him moving

VANESSA
Just be cool

The guards race past them Kevin looks surprised

KEVIN
How’d you know they’d--

VANESSA
It’s all about looking the part
You act confident enough and you
can do anything you want

KEVIN
You learn that in spy school

VANESSA
(a little embarrassed)
Oprah
KEVIN

VANESSA
Shut up

She drags him toward the nearest gift shop

EXT LOS ANGELES ZOO - ENTRANCE - SIMULTANEOUS

A fleet of government vehicles race toward the zoo
Marsky and the other agents pile out and push through the
turnstiles flashing badges at the surprised attendant
EXT LOS ANGELES ZOO - PATHWAY - MINUTES LATER

AN ODD-LOOKING PAIR OF FIGURES emerge from the gift shop

The teenager is wearing a neon green I LOVE THE LA ZOO shirt
and a backward baseball cap

He’s pushing what appears to be an old lady in a rented
wheelchair She’s wearing a straw hat cheap plastic
sunglasses a tiger-print shawl wrapped around her neck

It’s Kevin and Vanessa of course This is what passes for
incognito in a pinch

KEVIN
This isn’t gonna work

VANESSA
Remember what I said Just look the
part You can do this
A group of agents round the corner Hurrying toward them

Kevin closes his eyes Takes a deep breath

And when he opens them he’s got the eye of the tiger The
thrill of the fight Rising up to the challenge of a rival

He pushes the wheelchair toward the agents No hesitation

The agents get closer Closer

Kevin doesn’t even flinch
And the agents dash right past them

VANESSA
Told ya

Kevin manages a shaky grin He did it
KEVIN
(noticing a sign)
Wanna check out the sea lions
VANESSA

Don’t make me get out of this
chair

EXT LOS ANGELES ZOO - PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER
Kevin wheels Vanessa across the parking lot

She reaches out and casually jiggles the handle of each car
they pass until she finds one that’s unlocked

VANESSA
Here we go

She scrambles out of the wheelchair and they pile inside

INT UNLOCKED CAR - CONTINUOUS
Vanessa slides into the driver’s seat

KEVIN
Do you know how to hotwire a car

VANESSA
No Do you

KEVIN
(freaking out)
What Why would I know something
like that

Kidding I totally know how

She pries the covering off the underside of the steering
column and ducks out of sight A few seconds later the car
rumbles to life

KEVIN
Oprah

VANESSA
That one actually was spy school

They pull out of the parking lot Kevin closes his eyes

KEVIN
No more car chases Ever

VANESSA
You handled yourself pretty well

KEVIN
Yeah only because I used to watch

KEVIN
I used to wish my mom would get
pregnant just so I could drive her
to the hospital in reverse

VANESSA
God You’re actually serious

EXT BANK —- LATER

Kevin parks outside the bank and he and Vanessa approach the
outdoor ATM machine

KEVIN
And we need money why

VANESSA
I have to get you out of town
Somewhere safe

She inserts her card punches in her password Frowns

KEVIN
What’s wrong

VANESSA
It’s rejecting my card

She hits a few keys and her balance is displayed onscreen

000

VANESSA
(understanding)
Marsky
KEVIN

Sowhat now
Vanessa shakes her head Still reeling from the betrayal
VANESSA
I don’t know They’1ll be watching
all my contacts If Marsky got to
the director he can get to anyone
(beat)
There’s no one left I can trust

KEVIN
You can trust me

This sinks in Vanessa slowly realizing he’s right
VANESSA
This isn’t a game Kevin Sooner or
later Marsky will find us And if
he doesn’t Leo will
Kevin merely shrugs
KEVIN
Good thing I’ve got a spy
INT LEO’S MANSION - LATE AFTERNOON

Leo watches grimly as the Arab businessmen climb into a limo
and back down the driveway

He turns to find Mr Duma and several GUNMEN waiting for him

LEO
Come on

Leo punches a code into an electronic keypad on the wall We
hear locks DISENGAGING then a hidden door swings open
INT LEO’S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Leo leads his henchmen down a narrow flight of stairs The
basement is dark Unfinished Ominous

It’s also filled with A SHITLOAD OF GUNS

We see racks of assault rifles Crates of ammunition Enough
firepower to overthrow a dozen small countries

LEO
Take what you need

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - LATE AFTERNOON

Vanessa and Kevin leave the stolen car parked outside a
random house and set off down the sidewalk

KEVIN
So let me get this straight This
Marsky guy steals the disc makes
everyone think you’re a traitor
And the only way to prove you’re
not is to get the disc back

VANESSA
Correct

KEVIN
So why not just go after him Kick
his douchebag ass

VANESSA
Because right now he’s surrounded
by other agents I have to lay low
Lure him out of hiding Then kick
his douchebag ass

KEVIN
What’s so special about this
computer program anyway

Vanessa glances around to make sure no one is eavesdropping

VANESSA
It’s a fail-safe program In case
hackers ever seize control of our
defense networks Deus is designed
to shut down the system Let us
retake control piece by piece

KEVIN
It shuts down America

VANESSA
Yeah But it’s worthless without
the passcode And Marsky knows it

INT CIA FIELD OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Agent Marsky is alone in the office studying his computer
He’s watching grainy TRAFFIC CAMERA FOOTAGE

We see Kevin’s car Vanessa embedded in the windshield with
Marsky in hot pursuit There are at least 30 of these videos

all grouped together on Marsky’s desktop

He freezes one of the video feeds Zooms in on Kevins
license plate until the numbers swim into focus

MARSKY
Gotcha

He grabs a pen and begins copying down the numbers--
At that moment another AGENT appears in the doorway
CIA AGENT
The director wants you to transfer

that traffic cam footage to his

workspace right away

Panicking Marsky hits the DELETE button One by one we see
the video files on his screen disappearing

MARSKY
Turns out there was some sort of
outage in the area Couldn’t
recover anything worth a damn

CIA AGENT
Huh I’11 let Donovan know

Once Marsky is alone he glances at the scrap of paper on his
desk He only copied down the plate’s first three letters

Marsky exhales angrily Goddamn it

Then he grabs his coat and hurries out of the office

EXT KEVINS HOUSE - EVENING

Kevin and his reluctant bodyguard approach the house Kevin
spots Caroline’s car in the driveway and winces

KEVIN
Crap Mom’s home

VANESSA
Maybe we should talk to her
Explain what’s going on

KEVIN
Are you kidding She freaked when
she found out I was keeping a
lizard in my room One look at you
and her head would explode She’d
have the cops here in no time

Vanessa sighs This day just keeps getting worse

INT KEVIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Kevin cracks the front door Listens The coast seems clear
He motions Vanessa inside Starts toward the stairs

Just then Caroline emerges from the kitchen

CAROLINE
There you are

Vanessa presses herself flat against the wall She’s hidden
from Caroline’s sightfor now

KEVIN
Oh Hey mom

CAROLINE
Don’t ‘hey mom’ me You’ve got a
lot of explaining to do

She starts forward into the living room Kevin backpedals
quickly leading her away from Vanessa

If Caroline so much as turns her head they’re busted

KEVIN
I um had to come home to change
clothes And then there was this
whole thing with my car--

CAROLINE
What kind of thing

Ever so carefully Vanessa creeps around the corner Just
inches away from Caroline’s back

KEVIN
Justcar stuff It’s kind of
technical You wouldn’t understand

Vanessa slips into the kitchen and out of sight
CAROLINE
Car trouble doesn’t give you an
excuse to play hooky Honestly I
expected more out of you

To Kevin’s horror Caroline follows Vanessa into the kitchen

INT KEVIN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Caroline enters the kitchen There’s no sign of Vanessa

We SWIVEL AROUND to reveal Vanessa hiding behind the island
in the center of the room

KEVIN
Okay jeez I’m sorry

Caroline starts around the island Vanessa scuttles sideways
on her hands and knees keeping out of sight

CAROLINE
I want you to take this seriously
Kevin You need to be thinking
about your future Getting into a
good pre-med program

Vanessa is trapped Caroline is close enough to touch
KEVIN
Maybe I don’t want to go into pre-
med Maybe I’11 do something else

CAROLINE
Like what

KEVIN
I dunno Join the CIA Be a spy

CAROLINE
That’s not a real job

Behind the island Vanessa looks annoyed

Kevin circles the island and sees Vanessa for the first time
Realizes she’s seconds away from getting discovered

KEVIN
Oh Um do we have any Kool-Aid

CAROLINE
Look in the fridge

KEVIN
(a helpless beat)
Can you look for me
Caroline rolls her eyes but obliges
Kevin gestures frantically and Vanessa darts out of the room

Caroline turns back holding out the Kool-Aid pitcher

KEVIN
Actually I’m not that thirsty

CAROLINE
What is with you today

KEVIN
Think I’m just gonna head upstairs

Bewildered Caroline watches as her strange son hurries away

INT KEVIN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kevin closes the door drops his backpack onto the bed
There’s no sign of Vanessa He glances at the closet

KEVIN
You can come out

Instead Vanessa drops from the ceiling behind him landing in

asmooth crouch
Kevin looks at her Looks at the ceiling So confused

KEVIN
How the hell

Vanessa ignores him Checks to make sure his door is locked

VANESSA
Sorry I got you in trouble

KEVIN
Shell get over it
(examining the backpack)
Aww Man

There’s a jagged hole in the backpack courtesy of Agent
Marsky Kevin unzips the bag pulls out his Algebra textbook

There’s a massive bullet hole in the center of the book

KEVIN
So much for homework
(He looks at Vanessa)
So What do you wanna do

AND WE CUT TO

INT KEVIN’S BEDROOM - LATER
Vanessa is sweating Flustered Eyes darting back and forth
We PAN DOWN to revealthe Xbox controller in her hands

Onscreen her video game character gets reduced to spinning
chunks of gore She flashes Kevin a dirty look

KEVIN
(innocently)
So I guess they don’t teach you how
to shoot stuff in spy school

VANESSA
Shut up

KEVIN
Your problem is you’re not aiming--

VANESSA
Okay who here has fired a real
gun Raise your hand

She raises her hand While she’s distracted Kevin shoots her
video game character again

VANESSA
Oh son of a bitch

KEVIN
Who here has defeated the Covenant
Armada on Legendary with three gold
skulls turned on

VANESSA
There’s not any part of that
sentence I understand

Inspiration strikes Kevin He pauses the game and digs
through his dresser Tosses something to Vanessa

It’s a prop replica of the badass pistol from Blade Runner

VANESSA
What is this

KEVIN
Teach me How to shoot for real

Vanessa isn’t in the mood She tosses the gun back to him

VANESSA
Point at the bad guy pull the
trigger repeat Lesson over

Kevin spins around striking the famous James Bond pose as he
pretends to mow down a series of invisible foes

KEVIN
Pew Pew

VANESSA
Lesson two don’t make gun noises

KEVIN
Sorry Okay what if someone’s
shooting at me Should I like do
a combat roll

VANESSA
Yeah it’s actually impossible to
hit someone doing a somersault

KEVIN
Really

VANESSA
No Don’t do combat rolls

Sighing Kevin returns the prop gun to his dresser He turns
back to find Vanessa holding the Oinky mask

VANESSA
How come you wear this thing

KEVIN
I dunno

VANESSA
Don’t people make fun of you

KEVIN

Course they do It’s just

(a little embarrassed)
They’re gonna make fun of me no

that dumb suit andit’s like I’m
in on the joke Laughing with them

(beat)
Besides what else am I supposed to
do Not everyone’s a ninja badass

VANESSA
I don’t know I saw your driving
today Seemed pretty badass to me

The compliment is tossed off lightlybut Kevin is a guy who
doesn’t get many compliments She just made his day

At that moment we hear FOOTSTEPS in the hallway
Vanessa rolls off the bed as the door opens to reveal--
Flower Cho She looks around suspiciously

FLOWER
Who were you talking to

KEVIN
(thinks for way too long)
God

Underneath the bed Vanessa rolls her eyes

FLOWER
I heard a girl’s voice

KEVIN
Sometimes I do voices When I pray
(falsetto)

Oh pretty good thanks for asking

She just stares at him Kevin quickly changes the subject

KEVIN
Whatwhat are you doing here
FLOWER

winces as the springs press against her
FLOWER
So where were you all afternoon

FLOWER
Oh man You got the poops again

Vanessa smirks Kevin looks flustered

KEVIN
No I did not get the poops

VANESSA

Meanwhile Flower notices the paused video game

Flower looks surprised She wasn’t expecting that

FLOWER
Okay Ready to hit the books

FLOWER
Oh Anything I can do

KEVIN

Flower’s voice grows very quiet Very cold

FLOWER
Sorry I bothered you

She grabs her Algebra book and sweeps out of the room
Kevin sinks onto the bed reeling That was a nightmare

VANESSA
(beat)
“Flower”

KEVIN
Her parents were hippies

VANESSA

Vanessa senses there’s more to the story and wisely says
nothing After a beat it all comes tumbling out

KEVIN
I never used to care about being a
dork you know I was okay with it
And then she started hanging out
with her friendsand it’s like
how can I compete with that
(beat)

Wanna hear something dumb I was
actually thinking about asking her
to Homecoming You believe that

Kevin looks sick to his stomach Realizing he might have just
screwed up his friendship with Flower permanently

EXT BEACHFRONT CONDO - NIGHT

The condo hangs over the edge of the eroded cliff supported
by wooden stilts high above the heaving surf of the Pacific

It’s secluded Beautiful

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - CONTINUOUS

Inside the condo is a different story Overturned furniture
emptied dresser drawers Like a cyclone touched down

Framed photographs of Vanessa hang on the walls In some of
them she’s posing with Leo Just another rich California
socialite Nothing here indicates her true occupation

Agent Marsky dumps another drawer and sifts through the
contents He’s panicked Shittin’ kittens

MARSKY
Damn it damn it damn it

He whips out his cell phone In his free hand he’s holding
the paper with the first letters of Kevin’s license plate

MARSKY

It’s Marsky Hey need a favor

This is off the record okay I

need you to pull a DMV list

License plate starts with M-2-V

(listens )

Just send it to my phone And keep

this quiet No agency no cops
He hangs up Hears a NOISE behind him Turns
Leo and three armed GUNMEN are standing right there

LEO
Yeah I hate cops too

Marsky bolts like a cockroach when the lights come on
Ducking around the corner dashing across the kitchen--
He flings open the back door--

And Mr Duma punches him in the face

Marsky collapses with a whimper Leo strolls into the room

MR DUMA
Yo you missed it I totally
punched the shit outta him

LEO
Where’s Vanessa

MARSKY
I don’t know

LEO
Mr Duma look in those drawers
see if you can find a can opener
big enough to handle a scrotum

MARSKY
Wait Wait You want the computer
disc right I’ve got it

Trembling he pulls the disc from his pocket Hands it over

LEO
Where’s the passcode

MARSKY
Vanessa She still has it

Leo pulls a pistol from his belt Marsky’s eyes widen

MARSKY
Don’t do this I can find her for
you Swear to God I can

LEO
Talk fast

MARSKY

She’s got someone helping her Some
kid I shot the hell out of his
car but they got away

(He licks his lips)
My guy is sending me a list of all
the potential plates in the area
You wanna find Vanessa that’s how
you do it

Leo considers the offer Nods

LEO
You have yourself a deal

Suddenly Marsky’s phone BEEPS loudly Marsky goes pale

LEO
Hold on

Leo fishes the Blackberry out of Marsky’s pocket and checks
the email that just popped up

We see a scrolling list of names and addresses Every license
plate in the area that begins with those three digits

LEO
Huh Never mind

He puts the gun against Marsky’s head

MARSKY
Oh motherf--

EXT BEACHFRONT CONDO - CONTINUOUS
The GUNSHOT shatters the silence

A few seconds later Leo and his henchmen emerge from the
condo Leo pauses beside his luxury sedan turns to Mr Duma

LEO
I want guys on this house 247 So

much as a Girl Scout comes
knocking I wanna know about it

EXT KEVIN’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT EARLY MORNING

Caroline emerges wearing her waitress uniform She climbs
into her car and backs down the driveway

INT KEVIN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kevin watches from the window as his mother pulls away

KEVIN
Okay she’s gone

Vanessa is dressed for action in a black tank-top and jeans

VANESSA
If I’m going after Marsky there’s
some stuff I’1l need And you’re
coming with me

KEVIN
Really

VANESSA
I can’t risk leaving you here
alone

KEVIN

(so happy)
Awesome

VANESSA
-but you’re staying in the car

KEVIN

(so sad)
Awww

EXT CITY STREETS INT KEVIN’S CAR - LATER

Kevin’s damaged Mazda Protege wheezes to a halt at the
stoplight In the passenger seat Vanessa looks around

VANESSA
What happened to the binoculars

KEVIN
On the floor

VANESSA
No they’re not

KEVIN
Well maybe they’re under the seat

Groaning Vanessa ducks down rooting under the seat
At that moment a low-rider filled with TEENAGE GANGBANGERS
pulls alongside them These are the exact same punks who

intimidated Kevin yesterday at high school

The gangbangers silently eyeball the bullet holes riddling
the side of Kevin’s car The busted windshield

Kevin meets their gaze Nods slightly ‘Sup homies

At that moment Vanessa straightens back up

From the gangbangers’ perspective this gorgeous woman was
just face-down in Kevin’s lap Draw your own conclusions

The light changes Kevin takes off in a SQUEAL of burning
rubber grinning like a madman

The gangbangers exchange stunned looks Holy shit dude

EXT OCEAN ROAD - LATER

In the distance we can see Vanessa’s condo silhouetted
against the night sky It appears deserted

Kevin’s car is parked a few hundred yards down the road

INT KEVIN’S CAR -— CONTINUOUS

Vanessa observes her condo through the binoculars Beside
her Kevin is still pleading his case

KEVIN
Give me one good reason

VANESSA
Because Marsky will be watching
this place that’s why

KEVIN
That’s like the worst reason ever

VANESSA
Youre staying in the car And
that’s final

KEVIN

(begging pathetically)
Please please please

EXT SHORELINE - LATER
Vanessa picks her way down the jagged cliffside
And yes Kevin is right behind her
And yes he’s still pestering her Like a little yipping dog
KEVIN
I’m like your backup I’m Danny
Glover and you’re the other guy
VANESSA
Kevin please If things go bad I

can’t protect you in there

They reach the beach and start toward the condo

KEVIN
Who says I need protecting You
think I don’t know how to fight

VANESSA
Yes That’s exactly what I think

Kevin stops walking offended Vanessa sighs turns back

VANESSA
What

KEVIN
Go on Try to hit me

VANESSA
We so don’t have time for this

KEVIN
Cause I took karate for four years
I know how to roll fools

VANESSA
What does that even mean

KEVIN
Means I’ve got the speed of a
panther The reflexes of a--

Vanessa reaches out and slaps Kevin He falls on his ass

KEVIN
I wasn’t ready

VANESSA
Youre staying outside panther

She starts down the beach again Kevin hurries after her

KEVIN
Okay then teach me

VANESSA
Teach you what

KEVIN
Spy stuff Vulcan death pinches
killing people with your thumb--

VANESSA
You have thumb issues
KEVIN
Like do you ever do a cartwheel
and pick up a gun with one hand and
start shooting before you land

VANESSA
I do that all the time
KEVIN
You do
VANESSA
No
KEVIN

What about wall-flips

VANESSA
What’s a wall-flip

KEVIN
Like when someone’s chasing you and
you run up the side of a wall and
do a backflip and land behind them

VANESSA
Why would someone be chasing me
toward a wall

KEVIN
I dunno Like an attack dog or
something Or a pet tiger

VANESSA
Do you even know what spies do

EXT ROCKY SHORE —- CONTINUOUS

They’re now standing at the base of the cliff directly
beneath Vanessa’s condo She starts climbing

KEVIN
Come on please I won’t be in the
way If you leave me here I’1l get
attacked by a hobo or something
And it’1l totally be your fault

Vanessa considers him for a beat Reluctantly gives in
VANESSA

God fine Just be quiet and do
exactly what I say

Elated Kevin scrambles up the cliff after her

They reach the base of the condo supported by large wooden
pillars jutting out of the eroded cliffside

She peers out from beneath the edge of the condo The world
is silent except for the crashing SURF in the distance

Vanessa motions to Kevin and they emerge from cover

She unlocks the front door and they slip inside

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - CONTINUOUS

Vanessa leaves the lights off She creeps across the living
room picking through the debris strewn across the floor

Kevin takes in the devastated living room

KEVIN
Whoa

Vanessa stops short staring at something on the floor--

Agent Marsky’s corpse is slumped in the corner We can’t see
the gory details but this is clearly one dead dude

KEVIN
(helpfully)
You got a dead guy

VANESSA
It’s Marsky

Kevin slowly reaches out and nudges the corpse with his toe

VANESSA
What did you do that for

KEVIN
Never touched a dead guy before

Sighing Vanessa pats down Marsky’s pockets Nothing

VANESSA
He doesn’t have the disc
(thinks for a beat)
It’s Leo He’s the only other
person who knew where I lived

She slumps against the wall looking defeated

KEVIN
What’s the matter

VANESSA
I told you bringing in Marsky was
the only way to clear my name
Prove I didn’t kill those agents

KEVIN
But we can still find the disc

VANESSA
They won’t believe me With Marsky
dead they’1l think I’m just trying
to cut a deal to save myself

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS

Vanessa’s bedroom has been similarly ransacked Paintings
slashed drawers emptied the mattress overturned

The only thing left intact is the large flatscreen TV mounted
against the wall

Vanessa opens a small jewelry box on her nightstand and takes
out a silver locket She slips it around her neck

VANESSA
(off Kevin’s reaction)
It was my mom’s

KEVIN
Are you serious We came all the
way here for a necklace
Vanessa taps a sequence of keys on the TV remote--

And the television’s screen smoothly retracts to reveal a
hidden storage compartment

VANESSA
Among other things

The hidden compartment is filled with guns Twin Desert
Eagles A bolt-action M40A3 sniper rifle

And Vanessa’s pride and joy

A MILKOR MGL GRENADE LAUNCHER If you ever need to murder six
elephants in a row this is your weapon of choice

Kevin grabs the grenade launcher and strikes a pose

KEVIN
Aw yeah No diggity no doubt

VANESSA
Give me that
(does a double take)
“No diggity” Jesus

KEVIN
Sorry I got excited

Suddenly Vanessa notices a SHADOWY FORM pass the window

VANESSA
Stay here

She grabs the Desert Eagles and enters the living room--

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The front door bangs open and an ARMED GUNMAN enters moving
low and fast

Vanessa sprints across the room and dives onto the kitchen
island sliding sideways across the counter--

The Desert Eagles ROAR in her hands--

Her shots drive the gunman back his body convulsing
spraying an arc of bullets as he dies

Vanessa rolls off the island as bullets tear through the
kitchen around her kicking up shards of plaster

Mr Duma and two more GUNMEN burst into the room

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
In the bedroom Kevin is hyperventilating

KEVIN
What do I do What do I do

His gaze falls on the weapon cache All that gleaming steel

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vanessa ducks out from behind the island and squeezes off a
pair of shots The gunmen scramble for cover

MR DUMA
She’s pinned down

The gunmen creep forward still spitting bullets The muzzle
flashes illuminate the darkened room like strobe lights

With her foot Vanessa wrenches open the cabinet under the
sink Grabs a container of industrial bleach

She flings the bleach in a high arc over the island--
Vanessa pops out of cover Fires a single shot

The container EXPLODES spraying bleach in all directions
Mr Duma drops his weapon and clutches his eyes SCREAMING

No time to celebrate Gunman 2 pivots around the side of the
island drawing a bead on her--

Vanessa rolls underneath the stainless steel table--
Jackknifing her body she flips the table over--
An instant later Gunman 2’s bullets PING wildly against the
tabletop deflecting shots in all directions
INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kevin stares at the assortment of guns Psyching himself up
KEVIN
(whispering)
Youre a greek god You’re a Viking
riding out for battle You Are A
Warrior

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bracing her back against the wall Vanessa shoves the table
with her legs sending it skidding across the floor--

The table strikes Gunman 2 staggering him--

An instant later Vanessa vaults over the top of the table
scissor-kicking the thug in the chin

She lands in a combat roll Diving out of the way as Gunman
3s bullets chew through the linoleum right behind her

Suddenly the bedroom door flies open to reveal Kevin

And he’s holding the MGL grenade launcher

VANESSA
Oh no

With a SCREAM of pure adrenaline Kevin fires

The grenade blasts across the room Ricochets against the far
wall Bounces off the ceiling--

Everyone has stopped shooting They’re frozen in place
trying to follow the bouncing ball of death

The grenade spins across the floor coming to restright
between the legs of Gunman 3 He looks down

GUNMAN 3
Hey
EXT BEACHFRONT CONDO - CONTINUOUS

We hear a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION Gunman 3 blasts through the
window his body spinning as he vanishes over the cliff

Now we see that part of the condo’s underside has been blown
away We pass through this gaping hole--
INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

And find Kevin sitting on his ass at the edge of the crater
He’s singed Stunned Damn lucky to be in one piece

The living room has been totaled The air thick with smoke
tongues of fire arcing across the walls

Mr Duma shoves a piece of debris aside and stands Sees
Vanessa crawling through the wreckage

He strides across the living room grabs her by the hair
Vanessa pivots sweeping the legs out from under him--

But Mr Duma is no amateur He elbows her in the face and
rolls atop her hands curling around her throat

Kevin stands on shaky legs Hoists the grenade launcher

KEVIN
Should I um shoot again

VANESSA AND MR DUMA
(simultaneous )
No

Kevin turns to find himself staring down the barrel of Gunman
2s rifle The thug smiles coldly

GUNMAN 2
Drop it kid

Kevin raises his hands Takes a step backward--

And accidentally falls right through the hole in the floor

Meanwhile Vanessa drives her knees into Mr Duma’s stomach
knocking the wind out of him She’s on her feet in a flash--

But Mr Duma grabs a piece of flaming debris and swings it
like a baseball bat Vanessa ducks the blow sidesteps

Mr Duma advances on her brandishing the burning spear

EXT BENEATH THE CONDO —- CONTINUOUS

Ten feet below the condo Kevin is wedged between a pair of
support struts He groans Looks up

Gunman 2 stands on the edge of the hole aiming down at him

Panicking Kevin fires the grenade launcher straight up

Gunman 2 recoils as the grenade shoots past him--
The grenade bounces off the ceiling--

And falls right back down toward Kevin

Kevin sees the grenade coming His eyes widen

He drops the grenade launcher and rolls over the side of the
ledge Half-running half-falling down the cliff

BOOM

The EXPLOSION blows out two of the wooden support struts The

entire condo shuddersthen begins to slide

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vanessa and Mr Duma fight for balance as the floor suddenly
tilts dramatically beneath their feet We can hear timbers
GROANING and SNAPPING like toothpicks

EXT ROCKY SHORE - CONTINUOUS

Then gravity takes over

With a THUNDEROUS ROAR the entire condo tears loose from its

foundation and topples over the side of the cliff
Kevin sprints down the hillside arms pinwheeling

The condo comes tumbling after him

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Pure chaos

Vanessa and her opponents slip slide and scrabble as the
living room violently rotates around them

Bouncing off the walls--
Skidding across the ceiling--

With a helpless SCREAM Gunman 2 disappears through the hole
in the floor Crunch

Mr Duma comes rolling toward Vanessa She locks her legs
around his neck and punches him in the face

Incredibly insanely they’re still fighting

EXT ROCKY SHORE —- CONTINUOUS

The condo lurches down the hillside slamming from one rocky
ledge to the next spraying debris in every direction

It’s right behind Kevin now Almost on top of him

KEVIN
AAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGHHHHH

Kevin suddenly loses his footing and falls--

A split-second later the condo crashes down behind him--

Then it soars right over him carried by its own momentum
missing the top of his head by inches

The condo launches off the final ledge and plunges into the
water below kicking up a plume of white spray

INT BEACHFRONT CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The impact flattens Vanessa and Mr Duma against the floor

Then water comes crashing in from every damn direction

Vanessa stands freezing water coursing all around her the
entire room tilting crazily

With a ROAR Mr Duma explodes out of the water

He swings at Vanessa again and again She backpedals
expertly deflecting every strike

But Mr Duma is steadily backing her into the corner The
water is already chest-high surging and frothing

Vanessa is trapped Mr Duma looming over her--

She grabs a piece of driftwood and uses it to block the next
punchbut Mr Duma shatters the board into two pieces

Vanessa ducks beneath the waterand slams the broken piece
of driftwood right through Mr Duma’s foot

Mr Duma HOWLS He struggles madly but the driftwood has
pinned him to the floor He’s stuck fast

Now the water is lapping at his chin Mr Duma’s eyes widen
as his open mouth disappears below the water line

Vanessa shoves off swimming desperately seeking an exit

The room is almost totally submerged now Only a few feet of
breathable air left

Vanessa takes one last gulp of air and dives Searching for a
door a window any way out of this watery hell

The water reaches the ceiling There’s no air left
Vanessa finds a fracture in the wall and tries to wriggle

through Dragging herself through a maze of splintered wood
and jutting pipes Quickly running out of air

EXT ROCKY SHORE - CONTINUOUS

Vanessa’s hand breaks the surface of the water--

But her foot is caught on a snarl of wreckage She’s stuck
She thrashes desperately So damn close to the surface
Suddenly a hand wraps around her wrist dragging her upwards

Kevin is balanced atop the sinking condo With a tremendous
heave he pulls Vanessa out of the wreckage

She collapses gratefully beside him gulping down air

VANESSA
Thanks

Kevin merely nods Too shell-shocked to say anything at all

EXT OCEAN ROAD - LATER
Vanessa and Kevin trudge back toward the car

Vanessa is limping badly Her body has soaked up a lot of
abuse over the last 24 hours and now she’s paying for it

KEVIN
Sorry I blew up your house

And made it fall in the ocean
(beat)

With all your guns inside

And we DISSOLVE to the next morning

Kevin enters the room closing the door behind him

Startled by the sound Vanessa bolts out of bed

And her legs promptly give out She grabs the dresser woozy
fighting for balance

KEVIN
You okay

VANESSA

Put an end to this

KEVIN

She glares at him Kevin instantly backpedals

KEVIN
Okay not so much but still You
need to rest

He’s right and she knows it She glumly sinks back into bed

KEVIN
Just stay out of sight when mom
gets home Soon as school’s over
we can figure out what to do next

Vanessa ignores this She’s staring at Kevin’s outfit with
mounting horror

Kevin is wearing his usual school attire a stiff dress shirt
and ironed pants His hair parted with military precision

VANESSA
Kevin No

KEVIN
What

VANESSA

You can’t wear that to school Are
you insane They’1ll eat you alive

KEVIN
II always wear stuff like this

VANESSA
No Not happening

She clambers out of bed and limps over to his closet
returning with a pair of jeans and a white t-shirt

KEVIN
That’s an undershirt

VANESSA
Exactly

Without preamble she pulls off Kevin’s shirt With girlish
modesty he tries to cover his nipples

KEVIN
Hey

VANESSA
Put this on

He reluctantly tugs the undershirt over his head

VANESSA
And the jeans

KEVIN
Turn around first

VANESSA
Put on the jeans or I’1l break your
elbow

KEVIN

Putting on jeans
He shimmies out of his slacks Vanessa frowns at his feet

VANESSA
Are those penny loafers What are

While he obliges Vanessa grabs his hair with both hands and
musses it spiking it in all directions

KEVIN
Come on

Vanessa steps back admiring her handiwork

VANESSA
Better

KEVIN

Squirts a fat dollop of Cheez Whiz into her mouth

Without warning the front door opens and Caroline strides
into the living room

Caroline drops her purse onto the couch She heads upstairs
without ever glancing in Vanessa’s direction

Vanessa exhales slowly That was ridiculously close

On the way to class Kevin passes the same tough-looking
gangbangers he encountered at the stoplight last night

Except this time Kevin makes eye contact with them

Could his reputation finally be turning around

In the kitchen Vanessa digs through drawersemerging with
a wicked 10-inch steak knife

She creeps back toward the door The BELL rings again

Suddenly we hear FOOTSTEPS from above Caroline

Coming

Vanessa hesitates torn between the need to protect Kevins
mom and her fervent desire to stab Leo in the face

Caroline stares at him A little weirded out

CAROLINE

Vanessa slips behind the kitchen door just as Caroline
enters Leo and his men are right behind her

LEO
Nice place

CAROLINE
I’m sorry why are you here

LEO
You own a red Mazda Protege

Caroline opens the fridge While her back is turned Vanessa
extends the knife from behind the door--

The tip of the blade quivers inches from the back of Leo’s
neck It would be so damn easy

CAROLINE
That’s Kevin’s car My son

LEO
Think we could speak with him

CAROLINE
He’s at school right now

Caroline emerges with the pitcher of grape Kool-Aid and
Vanessa ducks back out of sight Damn it

tunnel high-fiving only the most attractive cheerleaders

DARREN
YEAH MAKE SOME FRIGGIN’ NOISE

Darren reaches the end of the tunnel and purposely runs right
into Flower She loses her balance and falls on her ass

DARREN
Didn’t see you there Bluski

Smirking he extends a hand to help her back up--

And Flower punches him right in the balls

Darren’s eyes roll back He crumples clutching his battered
sack and mewling pitifully

Flower calmly gets to her feet and continues clapping

FLOWER
(even more bored)
Woo Warthogs

In the stands the BURNOUTS who were heckling Kevin a few
days ago now exchange impressed glances

BURNOUT 1
Dude Oinky’s a badass

BURNOUT 2
I heard he totally tore up the zoo

BURNOUT 3
I heard he killed like 500 monkeys

BURNOUT 1
Kids hardcore

The gym doors open to reveal Vanessa Even in her disheveled
state she’s still the hottest woman these hormonally-charged
little bastards have ever seen Jaws drop left and right

Vanessa strides across the floor Grabs Oinky’s arm and pulls
the startled mascot out of the gym

The Burnouts break into rapturous applause
BURNOUT 1
Yeah Oinky Get you some
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Vanessa drags Oinky down the empty hallway

FLOWER

Vanessa stops Frowning at the very unKevinlike voice Then
she pulls off the plastic mask revealing Flower

VANESSA

FLOWER

VANESSA
A friend of Kevins

FLOWER
(suddenly suspicious)
Oh God Are you like a cougar

VANESSA
(a little hurt)

FLOWER
Too old to be a friend of Kevins

VANESSA
Look do you know where he went
(Flower doesn’t answer)
He’s in danger Please

FLOWER
He left About 10 minutes ago

Vanessa exhales angrily Starts down the hallway
Flower hesitatesthen calls after her

FLOWER
Is he really in danger

INT LEOS SEDAN - LATE MORNING

Goon 1 is driving In the backseat a very nervous Kevin is
wedged snugly between Leo and Goon 2

LEO
You got two options here Option
one you tell me where Vanessa is

get to live a long life make lots
of ugly babies die in Florida in

KEVIN
Okay

Leo reaches into the luxury sedan’s built-in cooler and takes
out a gleaming silver corkscrew

LEO
Option two I stick this into your
left eye twist it a little bit
then pull as hard as I can

KEVIN
(beat)
You guys aren’t cops are you

Suddenly Kevin’s cell phone RINGS Leo pulls the phone from

Vanessa hangs up Passes the phone back to Flower
And sees that Flower is scared to death

VANESSA
He’s going to be okay

FLOWER

Vanessa looks sick with guilt

VANESSA

INT FLOWER’S CAR -— LATE MORNING

Flower parks on the street outside Leo’s mansion Vanessa is
busy scribbling something on a scrap of paper

VANESSA
Stay here

FLOWER
But--

VANESSA

If Kevin doesn’t come out in five
minutes get out of here

FLOWER
What about you

Vanessa doesn’t answer
94

INT LEO’S STUDY - LATE MORNING
Leo is fixing himself another drink A little buzzed now
LEO
Hey you wanna watch some TV or

something

KEVIN
Okay

LEO
You like The Food Network

At that moment the study door opens revealing

VANESSA Flanked on either side by the two armed Goons She
looks exhausted Helpless Defeated

LEO
God look at you This is just not
your day is it

Vanessa ignores him Locks eyes with Kevin

VANESSA
Are you okay

Kevin manages a weak nod

Vanessa takes two items from her pocket The first is the
index card with the passcode The second item--something
small and orange--gets palmed into her free hand

She glances at the scrap of paper Then at Leo

VANESSA
First let him go

LEO
Come on V You really think I’m
gonna negotiate

VANESSA
Yeah I do

And now we see the item in her hand A SMALL ORANGE LIGHTER

Vanessa holds the index card over the lighter The paper
ignites at once blackening disintegrating

LEO
(freaking out)
What are you doing

Vanessa tosses the lighter over her shoulder It clatters
across the floor and disappears over the railing

VANESSA
Youve got about 20 seconds before
I start forgetting numbers

LEO
You crazy bitch

VANESSA
Fifteen seconds

Leo is panicking He nods to the Goons who move aside

VANESSA
Kevin go

KEVIN
What about you

VANESSA
Get out of here

Kevin crosses the room Vanessa watches him go Both of them
knowing that she’ll never leave this room alive

As soon as Kevin is gone Leo seizes a pen and paper

LEO
Okay the code Come on

Vanessa speaks slowly Deliberately Buying time
VANESSA
Vv I 5 3 A 3
INT LEO’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Kevin stumbles down the stairs in a daze He can’t process
what just happened The sacrifice Vanessa is making for him

From above we still hear Vanessa calmly RECITING NUMBERS
Suddenly Kevin steps on something Stops Glances down

It’s Vanessa’s orange lighter

INT LEO’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

VANESSA
5 D T 9 8 4 3

Leo finishes copying down the string Looks at her

LEO
That’s it

VANESSA
That’s it

Leo crosses the room and opens the closet to reveal--

THE BLACK DUFFEL BAG FILLED WITH CASH He unzips one of the
side pockets and takes out the Deus disc

LEO
You know I don’t get you I don’t
get the type of person who can date
someone pretend to be in love and
the whole time it’s just a job
What kind of life is that
Vanessa says nothing but his words cut deep
LEO
I’ve been a lot of things in my
life but I’ve never been a whore
Vanessa looks away miserably

Leo pops the disc into his laptop Boots up the Deus program
Carefully enters the passcode

BOOP An error message appears Incorrect passcode

LEO
No

He frantically retypes the password Another BOOP

LEO
No

Vanessa smiles faintly Leo sees this and turns apoplectic

LEO
You think this is funny

VANESSA
Sorry Leo Guess it’s not your day
either
Leo stands starts toward her Shaking with fury

They stare each other down for a dangerous beat Leo is too
angry to speak Vanessa simply has nothing to say

At last Leo turns to Goon 2

LEO
Gun

GOON 2
Sir

LEO

Give Me Your Gun
He takes Goon 2’s pistol Points it at Vanessa--
Vanessa closes her eyes--
And that’s when Goon 1 speaks up

GOON 1
Uh boss

Kevin is standing in the doorway

Vanessa looks horrified Her sacrificeall of thisit was
all for nothing

LEO
You forget something

KEVIN
Your house is on fire Just thought
you should know

A flicker of concern crosses Leo’s face Is he bluffing

LEO
Bullshit

Goon 1 steps out of the room and leans over the bannister
checking out the living room below

A long pause Everybody waiting tensely

LEO
Well

GOON 1
House is on fire

Leo loses it Kicks his desk in a fit of rage
LEO
You little retard What part of
arms dealer do you not understand

Kevin looks confused Leo takes a deep breath

LEO
The basement Is full Of guns

We PULL BACK OUT OF THE ROOM--

INT LEO’S MANSION LEO’S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

IN THE SAME SHOT we glide down to the living room which is
now engulfed in flames Everything is on fire

Now we drop through the burning floor entering the BASEMENT

The fire has nearly reached the ammo crates Thousands of
bullets and explosives just waiting to go off

We ROCKET BACK UP through the living room returning to--

INT LEO’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
KEVIN’S FRIGHTENED FACE

KEVIN
Whoops

And then the whole world blows up
The floor buckles violently as hundreds of bullets punch

through the floorboards showering splinters everywhere The
sound of GUNFIRE shakes the entire house

Now things start to happen fast
Vanessa seizes Goon 1’s weapon--

A dozen bullets tear through Goon 2 He jerks and twitches
like a white guy trying to dance--

Leo and Kevin dive for cover in opposite directions--

Leo lunges onto his desk which promptly disintegrates
beneath him spilling him to the floor--

Kevin darts across the room Hurls himself into the closet--

And the duffel bag full of money falls right in his lap

Vanessa and Goon 1 dance back and forth struggling for the
gun as bullet holes pepper the floor all around them

She plants her feet and drives him through the open door--

INT LEO’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS
And right over the bannister

They plunge 15 feet to the ground below Vanessa angles
herself in midair so she’ll land atop the Goon--

CRUNCH They land on a burning couch Goon 1 disappears
inside the fiery velour deathtrap--

Vanessa rolls off the couch Looks around

The living room is a flaming hell Bullets randomly screaming
through the air everywhere you look Huge sections of the
floor have already fallen away

Leo bursts out of the study his gun held at the ready

He looks like a supreme badassuntil a bullet whizzes past
his head and he SHRIEKS like a little old lady

Vanessa sees Leo coming and dives for cover behind an
enormous marble sculpture--

A split-second later the sculpture plunges through the
weakened floorboards leaving her exposed again Shit

INT LEO’S STUDY - SIMULTANEOUS

Meanwhile Kevin crawls out of the closet dragging the
duffel bag behind him

BANG A bullet hole appears right in front of him
Freaked Kevin turns and crawls in the opposite direction--

BANG Another bullet hole misses him by inches

Kevin zigzags across the room on his hands and knees bullet
holes appearing all around him

He reaches the laptop Ejects the Deus disc

KEVIN
Come on come on

He slips the disc into his pocket Stands

KEVIN
Here goes nothing

Then he sprints toward the window Dives through the air--
And bounces right off the glass
KEVIN
(muffled)
Ow
INT LEO’S MANSION - SIMULTANEOUS
Leo hurries down the stairs squeezing off shots--

Vanessa spots Goon 1’s fallen pistol She dives for it--

But at that exact moment a huge section of the floor falls
away beneath her

Vanessa grabs the edge of an Indian rug and hangs on for dear
life Below her the basement is a pit of rolling fire

The rug--which by the way is also totally on fire--begins
to slide Vanessa starts climbing desperately

The rug slips faster and fasterthen vanishes into the pit
Now Vanessa is hanging from the side of the pit Her legs
dangling just above the crackling flames

INT LEO’S STUDY - SIMULTANEOUS

Kevin hammers frantically on the window with his duffel bag
The goddamned thing refuses to break

KEVIN
Stupid Strong Window

INT LEO’S MANSION - SIMULTANEOUS

Vanessa is still dangling above the pit

Leo takes aim at her Like shooting fish in a flaming barrel
Suddenly a SURFACE-TO-AIR ROCKET screams out of the basement
The rocket narrowly misses Vanessa--

Corkscrews in mid-air--

And zooms toward Leo

He dives aside losing his gun in the process and the rocket
EXPLODES somewhere inside what used to be the kitchen

Leo stands A little confused

LEO
When did I get rockets

Bracing her feet against the crumbling floorboards Vanessa
flips out of the pit landing in a smooth combat roll

At the same time Leo grabs an iron poker out of the blazing
fireplace Its tip glows red-hot

They circle each other in the center of the room
Bullets still flying

Flames crawling across the ceiling

Neither of them speak The time for talk is so over

Leo comes for her Swinging the iron bar like a broadsword
Vanessa backpedals ducking each blow

He’s driving Vanessa into the corner Trapping her

With a WAR CRY Leo rushes forward the poker extended--
Vanessa turns Takes two giant steps forward

Then she runs right up the wall

Launches herself backward

Spinning in mid-air

Landing right behind Leo

He turns eyes widening in surprise--

Vanessa strikes him in the throat with her extended thumb
She just crushed his Adam’s apple

Leo slumps to the ground The light fading from his eyes

EXT LEO’S MANSION —- CONTINUOUS

The front door bangs open and Vanessa stumbles out in a cloud
of smoke reeling on her feet

A few seconds later we hear the TINKLE of breaking glass

KEVIN (0S)
AAAAAAAAAUUUUGGGHHH

And Kevin plunges into the bushes right beside her

Vanessa drags him out of the bushes helps him up Kevin is
still clutching the black duffel bag

KEVIN
Where’s Leo

VANESSA
Dead

KEVIN
How

Smiling slightly Vanessa extends her thumb
Kevin’s whole face lights up

KEVIN
I knew it

Kevin glances at the burning mansion

KEVIN
So um what now

VANESSA
Try to convince them I was set up
Hope someone believes me

She shrugs Not particularly optimistic about her chances

Kevin thinks for a beat Drops the duffel bag at her feet

KEVIN
Yeah or there’s option two

She opens the bag with her toe revealing the cash

KEVIN
I’m not sure how much is there
Probably enough to buy yourself a
new name though

Vanessa doesn’t know what to say She smiles softly

VANESSA
I always liked “Sarah”

KEVIN
I was thinking more like a sexy spy
name Like McKenzie Bloodstone
(She gives him a look)
Or just Sarah That works too

They regard each other for a beat

KEVIN
This is really it huh

VANESSA
Looks that way
(beat)
I’m glad I fell through your
windshield

KEVIN
Yeah Me too

She embraces him tightly Whispers in his ear

VANESSA
Ask her
(He looks surprised )
Trust me

Then she shoulders the duffel bag and hurries across the
yard quickly disappearing from sight

FLOWER (0S)
Kevin

He turns to find Flower standing behind him

Kevin starts to smile--

Then Flower hauls back and punches him in the chest

KEVIN
What was that for

FLOWER
I thought you were dead I was
coming up here to avenge you

Kevin grins He can’t help himself

KEVIN
Really You were gonna avenge me

FLOWER
Don’t laugh It’s so not funny

Kevin hesitates He has to get this off his chest
KEVIN
Hey I’m sorry I should’ve just
told you the truth I was a dick

FLOWER
You were kind of a dick

But she’s smiling too Grinning from ear to ear actually
FLOWER
Anyway crazy cougar lady wanted me
to give you this Said you’d know
what to do with it

She passes Kevin a piece of paper--

INSERT We FLASHBACK to Vanessa in the study as she prepares
to burn the index card with the passcode

INSERT Then we SWIVEL AROUND to reveal that the card she’s
holding is blank She touches the flame to the fake card

Now Kevin looks at the index card in his hand and we see the
familiar string of numbers and letters The real code

Kevin starts to smile--

Anda HUGE EXPLOSION rocks the mansion behind them

Kevin and Flower jump Exchange a shaken glance
FLOWER

Maybe we should stand somewhere
else

KEVIN
Uh-huh

EXT LEO’S DRIVEWAY - EARLY AFTERNOON

By the time the CIA shows up firefighters have put out
most of the blaze The mansion is little more than ash

Director Donovan exits his carand finds Kevin and Flower
sitting calmly on the curb waiting for him

KEVIN
‘Sup

DONOVAN
Where’s Agent Cross

Kevin looks confused Glances at Flower

KEVIN
Do you know an Agent Cross

FLOWER
Not ringing a bell

KEVIN
Yeah never heard of her

DONOVAN
Don’t get cute Do you have any
idea how much trouble you’re in

KEVIN
Really Because from where I’m
sitting it kinda looks like we
just saved the friggin’ day

He holds up the Deus computer disc in one hand the
handwritten passcode in the other

Donovan’s eyes widen He moves to take the items--
And Kevin jerks them back out of reach

KEVIN
Did I mention how much this sucked
Getting shot at getting kidnapped

FLOWER

Monkeys

KEVIN
I had to climb out of a monkey pit

DONOVAN
Cry me a river

whole deal’s off

DONOVAN
I don’t get it Why do you care
what happens to her

Kevin looks him right in the eye

KEVIN
Us badasses have to stick together

Flower snorts Then starts laughing She can’t help it
Kevin throws her an exasperated look

KEVIN
Youre totally ruining my moment

But now Flower has the giggles and can’t stop Gasping for
breath tears rolling down her cheeks

Her laughter is infectious Despite his best efforts a thin
smile crawls across Donovan’s face

DONOVAN
All right badass You got yourself
a deal

INT GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

A cross-country Greyhound bus half-filled with dozing
passengers We DRIFT TOWARD the back row where we find--

VANESSA She’s fast asleep The black duffel bag on her lap
As she sleeps a faint smile plays across her face

Whatever she’s dreaming about it must be good

EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
The bus trundles past a sign that reads WELCOME TO NEBRASKA

And as our ORCHESTRAL SCORE builds to a triumphant soaring
crescendo we FADE TO BLACK

KEVIN

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

Friday night Students in formal dresses and rented tuxedos
stream toward the high school It’s the Homecoming dance

Suddenly we hear a TREMENDOUS ROAR Startled students raise
their eyes to the sky

Just in time to see a sleek military helicopter descending
toward the front lawn

The helicopter touches down Its doors open
And Kevin and Flower emerge
Kevin is rocking a slick Armani tux Total badass

Flower on the other hand looks adorable in a kaleidoscope
of fabric that she obviously made herself

Jaws drop as the pair crosses the lawn escorted by at least
eight grim-faced SECRET SERVICE AGENTS

Now this is how you make an entrance

INT HOMECOMING DANCE - CONTINUOUS
The other students stare in frank amazement

Kevin and Flower are busting a move in the middle of the
dance floor surrounded by a ring of Secret Service Agents

Darren enters the gym His eyes narrow at the sight of Kevin

DARREN
Bluski

He advances on Kevin Ready to kick some nerd ass
Suddenly a pair of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS get in his face
SECRET SERVICE AGENT 1
Hi there We’d like to have a few

words with you

DARREN
ButI didn’t do anything

SECRET SERVICE AGENT 1
Right this way sir

They lead Darren away ignoring his frightened protests

Meanwhile Dana pushes through the crowd Sees her former
friend dancing withwiththat geek

DANA
Oh my God what are you doing

Flower grins and cheerfully shoots Dana the finger Bitch

Then Flower drags Kevin deeper into the throng of dancers
Dana stares after them mouth hanging open cowlike
Kevin twirls Flower in a circle Pulls her close
FLOWER
Just so you know there’s a chance
people might be talking about us on
Monday
KEVIN
Huh Guess we’d better give ‘em
something to talk about
He dips her
Kisses her

After a shocked beat she kisses him back

And they dance away into the crowd

FADE OUT

THE END
