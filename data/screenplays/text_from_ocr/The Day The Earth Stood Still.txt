PEARSON
Government and Defense Department
officials are concerned by reports
of panic in several large Eastern
cities I am authorized to assure

you that so far there is no reasonable
cause for alarm The rumors of
invading armies and mass destruction

absolutely false I repeat -- these
rumors are absolutely false

ANOTHER ANGLE

PEARSON
The ship designed for travel outside
the earths atmosphere landed in
Washington today at 347 pm Eastern
Standard Time We still dont know
where it came from but I can reveal
that military leaders are considering
two possibilities that it came from
some unfriendly power here on earth --
or that it actually arrived from
another planet

nodding cordially to the General

Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door He
and then enters
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT
as Harley enters closing the door behind him Klaatu
longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for
first time Even sitting up in bed with his shoulder
in bandages he is a figure of great authority His
reflects inner dignity and assurance Harley who is a
hardened diplomatist cant help being impressed by his

present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu Harley
obviously has been sent by the President to find out
can Klaatus eyes study him cool penetrating

reserved
HARLEY
My name is Harley -- Secretary to
the President
(Klaatu continues to
study him silently)
Ive been told that you speak our
language -- that your name is Mr
Klaatu
KLAATU
(coolly)
Just Klaatu
HARLEY
The President asked me to convey his
deepest apologies for what has
happened We all feel--
KLAATU
(evenly)
Sit down Mr Harley
Somewhat relieved Harley seats himself He speaks with
a
half smile hoping to ease the tension
HARLEY
Im sure I dont have to point out
that your arrival was something of a
surprise
(getting a little
smile from Klaatu
he is encouraged to
do some fishing)
Had you been traveling long
KLAATU
About five months -- your months
HARLEY
You must have come a long way
KLAATU
About 250 million of your miles
Harley glances at him quickly to be sure hes not
joking

Hes not
blandly

HARLEY
Naturally were very curious to know
where it is you come from

KLAATU
(easily hes a
diplomat too)
From another planet Lets just say
that were neighbors

Harley reacts as his wildest assumptions are so

corroborated

HARLEY
Its rather difficult for us to think
of another planet as a neighbor

KLAATU
Im afraid in the present situation
youll have to learn to think that
way

HARLEY
(eyebrows raised)
The present situation

KLAATU
I mean the reasons for my coming
here

HARLEY
(his eagerness apparent)
Were very curious about that too
Would you care to talk about it

KLAATU
Id be glad to
(noticing that Harley
is settling himself

expectantly)
Not now of course -- with you alone
HARLEY

Perhaps youd rather discuss it
personally with the President--

KLAATU
(somewhat sharply)
This is not a personal matter Mr
Harley It concerns all the people
on your planet
HARLEY
(Startled by the scope
of this statement)
I -- Im not sure I understand--

KLAATU
I want to meet with representatives
from all the nations of the Earth

HARLEY

(shocked and perturbed

by this notion)
Im afraid that would be a little
awkward Its -- its completely
without precedent And there are
practical considerations -- the time
involved -- the enormous distances

KLAATU
(coolly)
I traveled 250 million miles What
about your United Nations

HARLEY
(Surprised and a little
puzzled)
You know about the United Nations

KLAATU
Weve been monitoring your radio
broadcasts for a good many years
Thats how we learned your languages
Lately weve been getting your
television also

HARLEY
(wryly)
You must have a rather strange
impression of us

KLAATU
(smiling)
The first two years of television we

were convinced that all you did was
wrestle

Harley smiles Then his mind reverts to the seriousness
the situation and he speaks gravely

HARLEY
Im sure you recognize from our broad-
casts the evil forces that have
produced the tension in our world
Surely you would agree--

KLAATU
(evenly)
I am not concerned Mr Harley with
the internal affairs of your planet
I consider that to be your business --
not mine

HARLEY
I was only hoping to make you
understand

KLAATU

(sternly impressively)
My mission here is not to solve your
petty squabbles It concerns the
existence of every last creature who
lives on Earth

HARLEY
(uncomfortably)
Perhaps if you could explain a little--

KLAATU
I intend to explain To all the
nations -- simultaneously
(his manner precludes
opposition)
How do we proceed Mr Harley

Harley is thoroughly shaken The tremendous force and
power

implicit in Klaatuss manner preclude the possibility
of

argument

HARLEY
(after a long
thoughtful moment)
We could call a special meeting of

the General Assembly But of course
the UN doesnt represent all of the
nations

KLAATU

Then why not a meeting of all the
Chiefs of State
eyes

Then

strange

shakes

HARLEY
(helplessly but
patiently)
Believe me you dont understand
They wouldnt sit down at the same
table

Growing a little impatient with such nonsense Klaatu

him evenly speaks with Jovian authority

KLAATU
I dont want to resort to threats
Mr Harley I simply tell you bluntly
that the future of your planet is at
stake I suggest you transmit that
message to the nations of the Earth

The eyes of the two men meet for a long silent moment

Harley rises quietly

HARLEY

I will make that recommendation to
the President

(he picks up his brief

case and hat)
I must tell you in all honesty that
Im extremely dubious about the
results

KLAATU
(with a half-smile)
Apparently Im not as cynical about
Earths people as you are

HARLEY
Ive been dealing in Earths politics
a good deal longer than you have
(he bows)
Goodnight sir

He turns and goes out

He stares after Harley for a moment puzzled by this
and apparently unreasoning world he has come to He

He was very nice about it But he

appears

KLAATU
Thank you Have you any news

HARLEY
Not very good news Im afraid
(digs into his
briefcase for some
papers)
The President accepted your suggestion
and cabled the invitations for a
meeting last night

(grimly)
Let me read you some of the replies

(he selects a cable

and reads)
The Premier wishes to inform the
Government of the United States that
it will be impossible for him to
attend the meeting suggested by the
President unless the meeting is held
in Moscow

(with a grimly-pointed

glance at Klaatu

Harley reads another

cable)
The suggestion of the President
regarding the possibility of a meeting
in Moscow would be unacceptable to
Her Majestys Government at the
present time Representation could
be sent only if the meeting were
held in Washington

Well -- there you have it

Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatus

but he ignores them Klaatu has listened to this

first incredulously then with mounting indignation
Conscious
of his quiet Olympian wrath Harley continues
uncomfortably
HARLEY
I tried to make you understand The
suspicions -- the jealousies -- the

mistrust--

(uneasily under

Klaatus level gaze)
Surely you realize that my government
has done everything in its power--

KLAATU
Its not your government Im thinking
about Its your world

HARLEY
Now that you understand the situation
more clearly perhaps youd like to
discuss the matter with the President

KLAATU

(sternly)
I will not speak to any one nation
or group of nations

(sharply bitterly)
I dont intend to add my contribution
to your childish jealousies and
suspicions

HARLEY
Our problems are very complex Mr
Klaatu You mustnt judge us too
harshly

KLAATU
I can judge only by what I see

HARLEY
Your impatience is quite
understandable

KLAATU
(sharply)
I am impatient with stupidity My
people have learned to live without

finds

his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying

But where would such a creature hide
himself Would he disappear into the

monstrously
distasteful idea

his paper down)
Why doesnt the Government do
something -- thats what I want to
know

What can they do Theyre only people --
Just like us

Its enough to give you the shakes
Hes got that robot standing there --
ten-foot tall -- just waiting for
orders to destroy us

This space man -- or whatever he is
We automatically assume hes a
menace Maybe he isnt at all

this silly notion)
Then whats he hiding for Why doesnt
he come out in the open

MR KRULL
Yeah

Like the fella says Whats he up
to

HELEN
Maybe hes afraid

MRS BARLEY
(with a derisive snort)
Hes afraid

HELEN
After all he was shot the moment he
landed here

(she pauses for a

moment thoughtfully)
I was just wondering what I would
do

KLAATU
(to Helen helpfully)
Perhaps before deciding on a course
of action youd want to know more
about the people here -- to orient
yourself in a strange environment

MRS BARLEY
(sharply)
Theres nothing strange about
Washington Mr Carpenter

KLAATU
(quietly tongue in
cheek)
A person from another planet might
disagree with you

MRS BARLEY
If you want my opinion he came from
right here on Earth
(with significant
emphasis)
And you know where I mean

MR KRULL
They wouldnt come in a space ship
Theyd come in airplanes

MRS BARLEY
(as though with
superior knowledge)
I wouldnt be so sure about that

MR BARLEY

word)
Stands to reason that fella wants
some thing or he wouldnt be here

That make sense Carpenter

Klaatu pauses for a moment then recites pleasantly

No -- Im afraid not

BOBBY
Is it different where youve been

cemetery)
Dont they have places like this

KLAATU
(slowly)
They have cemeteries But not like
this one You see they dont have
any wars

Bobby looks at him puzzled and impressed by this
incomprehensible notion

BOBBY
Gee -- thats a good idea

His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of
crosses

Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look
of

curiosity and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject

KLAATU
What would you like to do this
afternoon

After a moment Bobbys expression changes and he breaks
into
a broad grin

BOBBY
Go to the movies

KLAATU
All right

for this)

Bobby gives him a look of amazement then grins

Klaatu was kidding and simply hasnt any money

Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the
chalk in hand

MP CAPTAIN
This is the man you wanted to see
Professor

BARNHARDT
(studying Klaatu
curiously)
Thank you Captain

MP CAPTAIN
Ill wait outside

He steps out into the hall closing the door Barnhardt
continues to study Klaatu for a moment then points to

notations he made on the blackboard There is a
but anxious excitement in Barnhardts attitude

BARNHARDT
You wrote this

KLAATU

(nodding easily)
It was a clumsy way to introduce
myself -- but I understand youre a
difficult man to see

(glancing at the

blackboard

reproachfully)
I thought youd have the solution by
this time

BARNHARDT
Not yet Thats why I wanted to see
you
Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on

the
board Then he points to one of the expressions in an
equation
KLAATU
All you have to do now is substitute
this expression--
(pointing to a specific
place)
--at this point
Impressed and interested Barnhardt tugs at his chin as
he

studies and weighs the results

BARNHARDT
(slowly thoughtfully)
Yes -- that will reproduce the first-
order terms But what about the effect
of the other terms

KLAATU
Almost negligible With variation
of parameters this is the answer

BARNHARDT
How can you be so sure Have you
tested this theory

KLAATU

(with a slight smile)
I find it works well enough to get
me from one planet to another

(Barnhardt stares at

him blankly)
I understand youve called a meeting
to study our space ship

BARNHARDT
As though unsure of what hes heard)
Yes -- yes I have

KLAATU

My name is Klaatu

(noting that

Barnhardts expression

is changing from

amazement to

incredulity)
I spent two days at your Walter Reed
Hospital Room 309 My doctors name

Barnhardt hesitates for a long

goes to the door

attractive nurse called Ruth whos

this to sink in

then speaks with

quiet authority)
If you are not interested -- or if
you intend to turn me over to your
Army -- we neednt waste any more
time

BARNHARDT
(to the Captain his
voice a little

unsteady)
You can go now Captain Please thank
General Cutler and tell him -- tell

him that I know this gentleman

Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu

to adjust his mind

KLAATU
(dryly)
You have faith Professor Barnhardt

BARNHARDT
It isnt faith that makes good
science Mr Klaatu Its curiosity
(unable to conceal
his interest)
Sit down please I have several
thousand questions to ask you

KLAATU
(ignoring the
invitation)
I would like to explain something of
my mission here

BARNHARDT
That was my first question

thoughtful moment

Then

opens it and speaks to the Captain

Barnhardt sinks into a chair
KLAATU

(with some bitterness)
It was my intention to discuss this
officially -- with all the nations
of the Earth -- but I was not allowed
the Opportunity I have come to
realize since that your mutual fears
and suspicions are merely the normal
reactions of a primitive society

(gathering his thoughts)
We know from scientific observation
that you have discovered a rudimentary
kind of atomic energy We also know
that you are experimenting with
rockets

BARNHARDT
Yes -- that is true

KLAATU

In the hands of a mature civilization
these would not be considered weapons
of aggression But in the hands of
your people--

(he shrugs and shakes

his head)
Weve observed your aggressive
tendencies and we dont trust you
with such power

BARNHARDT
(puzzled)
If you mean that you are afraid of
us--

KLAATU
(with cool impressive
emphasis)
We want to be sure you dont make --
let us say -- an unfortunate mistake

We know the potentiality of these
developments and we are disturbed to
find them in the hands of children
You see weve had atomic energy for
five thousand of your years

(indicating the

telephone)
We discarded instruments like this
many centuries ago

(he paces thoughtfully)
So long as you were limited to
fighting among yourselves -- with
your primitive tanks and planes --

we were unconcerned But soon you
will apply atomic energy to space
ships -- and then you become a threat
to the peace and security of other
planets That of course we cannot
tolerate

BARNHARDT
(thoughtful and
impressed)
These other planets -- do they have
peace and security

KLAATU

We had our atomic wars -- thousands
of years ago

(he smiles wryly)
After that we fought with bows and
arrows Then slowly we learned
that fighting is no solution -- that
aggression leads to chaos

BARNHARDT
(with deep conviction)
We scientists understand this Even
we primitive scientists
(Straight forwardly)
What exactly is the nature of your
mission Mr Klaatu

KLAATU
I came here to warn you that by
threatening danger your planet faces

danger -- very grave danger I am
prepared however to offer a
solution

BARNHARDT

Would you care to be more specific

KLAATU

(evenly)
What I have to say must be said to
all concerned

(with a suggestion of

deference to Barnhardt)
It is too important to be entrusted
to any individual

Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatus
refusal
his

Barnhardt

After a

to go any further After a moments thought he speaks
seriously but with a twinkle in his eye

BARNHARDT
I gather that your efforts on the
official level were not entirely
successful

KLAATU

(sternly as this

unpleasant episode

is recalled)
I come to you as a last resort --
and I confess that my patience is
wearing thin

(with Jovian annoyance)
Must I take drastic action in order
to get a hearing

BARNHARDT
(uneasily)
What -- what sort of action do you
mean

KLAATU

Violent action -- since that seems
to be the only thing you people
understand

(quietly)
Leveling the island of Manhattan
perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of
Gibraltar into the sea

Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment passes
hand across his brow Then as Klaatu watches

paces the floor trying to digest what he has heard
moment he turns to Klaatu

BARNHARDT
Would you be willing to meet with
the group of scientists I am calling
together Perhaps you could explain
your mission to them and they in
turn could present it to their various
peoples

KLAATU
(quietly evenly)
Thats what I came to see you about
Barnhardt flings him a glance then looks momentarily

sheepish But his own eagerness carries him on He
paces the

floor thoughtfully

BARNHARDT
It is not enough to have men of
science We scientists are too easily

ignored -- or misunderstood We must
get important men from every field
Educators -- philosophers -- church
leaders -- men of vision and
imagination -- the finest minds in
the world

KLAATU

I leave that in your hands

BARNHARDT
Youd have no objection to revealing
yourself at this meeting

KLAATU
No -- not at all

BARNHARDT
What about your personal safety in
the meantime What about the Army --
and the police

KLAATU
My name is Carpenter and Im a very
earthy character living ina
respectable boarding house

BARNHARDT
(smiling but a little
concerned)
Im afraid I cant offer you any
real protection I have no influence
in cases of inter-planetary
conspiracy

KLAATU
Im sure Ill be quite safe until
the meeting

BARNHARDT

(he suddenly pauses
thoughtfully)
One thing Mr Klaatu Suppose this
group should reject your proposals
What is the alternative

KLAATU

(with a sense of quiet

inescapable power)
Im afraid you have no alternative
In such a case the planet Earth
would have to be--

(he looks for the

right word)
--eliminated

The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt

speechless
his keen mind reeling
BARNHARDT
Such power exists
KLAATU
I assure you such power exists
Barnhardt stands silent for a moment trying to collect
his
shattered thoughts Klaatu watches him as he starts
pacing

again

BARNHARDT

The people who came to the meeting
must be made to realize this They
must understand what is at stake

(after a thoughtful

moment he looks up)
You mentioned a demonstration of
force--

KLAATU
Yes

BARNHARDT
Would such a demonstration be
possible before the meeting

KLAATU
Yes -- of course

BARNHARDT
Something that would dramatize for
them and for their people the
seriousness of the situation
wishing

OUT

sitting in
go
and

Crockett

Something that would affect the entire
planet

KLAATU
(with a nod)
That can easily be arranged

BARNHARDT
(frightened by his
easy assumption of
infinite power)
I wouldnt want you to harm anybody --
or destroy anything

KLAATU
(easily)
Why dont you leave it to me Ill
think of something

BARNHARDT
(with a nervous half-
smile)
Maybe a little demonstration

KLAATU
(thinking about it)
Something dramatic -- but not

destructive
(intellectually amused)
Its quite an interesting problem
(Barnhardt nods vaguely)
Would day after tomorrow be all right
Say about noon
Klaatus bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken almost

hed never started this business

Mrs Barley are playing cards with Mr Krull Mrs
the landlady enters from the hall on her way to the

dining
room and notices Helen
MRS CROCKETT
Going out dear
HELEN
Yes Im waiting for Tom to pick me
up
MRS CROCKETT
(with a shudder)
Personally I wont go out after
dark these days
(with an attempt at
slyness)
But then -- Im not courting am I
She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does
so
almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out having been
kibitzing the card game
MRS CROCKETT
(thoroughly startled)
Oh -- Mr Carpenter--—
Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the
dining
room He turns puzzled to find Helen watching with a
slight
smile
KLAATU
Everyone seems so--
(he shakes his hands
to indicate
nervousness)
HELEN
Jittery is the word
Helen watches him a little uneasy in his presence She
is
fond of him and she cant help being curious and
concerned

about his brush with the police

KLAATU
(with a contemplative
smile)
Bobbys the only person I know who
isnt -- Jittery

HELEN
He has his homework to keep him
occupied

KLAATU
(fondly sincerely)
Hes a fine boy Mrs Benson

HELEN
Naturally I think so

KLAATU
Warm and friendly and intelligent--
(thoughtfully)
You know -- hes the only real friend

Ive made since Ive been here

Helen is deeply moved by Klaatus affection for the
boy She

tried to dismiss her curiosity about him but she
cant She

decides to face it

HELEN
(hesitantly and with
some difficulty)
Mr Carpenter -- this is none of my
business but -- why did that
detective come here last night

KLAATU

(with easy frankness)
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a
few questions Bobby and I tried to
see Professor Barnhardt in the
afternoon but he wasnt in
Apparently they thought I was looking
for secrets of some kind

Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention
of

Barnhardt They are interrupted by the ringing of the
doorbell Helen goes to answer it

impatient anxious to get going
Hello--

that she hasnt her
coat on he consults
his watch)
The picture starts at eight-fifty

HELEN
(in explanation)
I was talking to Mr Carpenter

TOM
(lightly but with
real sarcasm

underneath)
I hope Mr Carpenter wont think Im
intruding

Helen tries to shush him to indicate Klaatu is in the

next
room when Klaatu appears in the doorway He must have
heard
Toms remark and there is an awkward moment Klaatu is
completely unperturbed but Helen is embarrassed
KLAATU
Excuse me I was just going up to my
room

Helen watches as he starts to put away his work She
wants

to tell him something but finds it difficult to say

(hesitantly almost
guiltily)
Bobby -- I think it would be better

if we didnt see quite so much of

BOBBY
(shocked and
bewildered)
Gee why Mom Hes my best friend
And hes awful good in arithmetic
He even helps Professor Barnhardt

HELEN
Did you and Mr Carpenter really go
to see Professor Barnhardt

BOBBY
Sure we did He wasnt there but we
went to see him And Mr Carpenter
showed him how to do his arithmetic

Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for

Klaatus
story Sensing his mothers uneasiness the boy looks
for
something intriguing -- some deep dark secret
BOBBY
(shrewdly)
Mom -- is there something wrong with

Mr Carpenter

HELEN
What do you mean dear

BOBBY
I mean -- on account of that policeman
last night
(his eyes light up
hopefully)
You think hes a bank robber maybe
Or a gangster

mistake before you make it

Klaatu looks at her in warm considered admiration
moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch

an entire section of the side wall is made transparent
Through it as through a screen we can see out into

building Most of the chairs are already occupied and
latecomers are still moving in through the door Facing

Ladies and Gentlemen--

INT BUILDING - MED CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

He addresses them gravely with a note of terrible
disappointment in his voice

BARNHARDT

I called you from your work and from
your homes all over the world because
we were to meet here tonight with a
man from another planet -- the man
who came here in this ship

(there are audible

exclamations of

surprise and

disappointment)
As you all know this is no longer
possible I can only say that I share
the bitterness of your disappointment

INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots
the people in the meeting They are the cream of
intellectuals -- scientists churchmen educators

of social and political thought There are several
among them There are turbaned Indians Chinese

several Negroes All religions are represented Every
important world power is represented

INT MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP

Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening as the

Full of chagrin he continues addressing the meeting
BARNHARDT
--under the circumstances the Army
people have asked us to leave the
building And since their concern
is for our safety I can do nothing

but suggest that we comply--

Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected
appearance of the ramp silently opening out of the

the space ship
MED SHOT - BARNHARDTS AUDIENCE

as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious
appearance of the ramp Then as they watch there is a

gasp of terror

MED SHOT - AT SHIP

as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to
ground In a moment Klaatu and Helen appear at the
of the ship Helen comes down the ramp to join

while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp

MED CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS

The Colonel stands near the door flanked by a group of
soldiers their rifles at the ready The Colonel is

by what he sees His eyes are on the revered figure of
and hes debating what he should do

MED CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive

tunic He stares with even defiance at the armed
personality

as though holding them off by sheer weight of his

He turns to look out at the audience which is held
spellbound Then after a breathless moment he speaks

KLAATU

(straightforwardly

with almost stern

authority)
I am leaving soon and you will forgive
me if I speak bluntly

(he pauses studying

the faces)
The Universe grows smaller every day --
and the threat of aggression by any
group -- anywhere -- can no longer
be tolerated

MED CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE
of three of the delegates listening intently (These
are from Russia India and France)

KLAATUS VOICE
(over scene)
There must be security for all -- or
no one is secure This does not
mean giving up any freedom except
the freedom to act irresponsibly

CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE
He is an American

KLAATUS VOICE
(over scene)
Your ancestors knew this when they
made laws to govern themselves --
and hired policemen to enforce them

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

KLAATU
We of the other planets have long
accepted this principle We have an
organization for the mutual protection
of all planets -- and for the complete
elimination of aggression A sort of
United Nations on the Planetary
level The test of any such higher
authority of course is the police
The

imperturbably

soldiers

emphasizing his

force that supports it For our

policemen we created a race of robots--
(indicating Gort)

Their function is to patrol the

planets -- in space ships like this

one -- and preserve the peace In

matters of aggression we have given

them absolute power over us

MED CLOSE SHOT - GORT

normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes

at the audience is his only movement

KLAATUS VOICE
(over scene)
At the first sign of violence they
act automatically against the
aggressor And the penalty for
provoking their action is too terrible
to risk

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

KLAATU

The result is that we live in peace
without arms or armies secure in
the knowledge that we are free from
aggression and war -- free to pursue
more profitable enterprises

(after a pause)
We do not pretend to have achieved
perfection -- but we do have a system --
and it works

(with straightforward

candor)
I came here to give you the facts
It is no concern of ours how you run
your own planet -- but if you threaten
to extend your violence this Earth
of yours will be reduced to a burned-
out cinder

KLAATU
Your choice is simple Join us and
live in peace Or pursue your present
