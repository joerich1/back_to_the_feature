EXT RONNIES TRAILER - EARLY DAWN
RAE is naked

Wrapped around her shoulders is a loose-knit spread

that

conceals her slender form She is in her 20s a
strawberry

blond with cinnamon freckles spotted across her pale
skin

She is beautiful without trying

She stares at the distant trees This is the South the
small

town of FISHERVILLE TENNESSEE

Soon Rae will be alone

Ronnie shuts the door and feels a wave of sudden
rushes past Rae

RONNIE

Ronnie is vomiting into the toilet as Rae rubs his
Each painful dry heave makes Rae comfort him more

RAE

EXT RONNIES TRAILER - MORNING
Ronnie places his duffle bag in Gills truck Rae
cough

GILL
You sick

Rae doesnt answer
Gill backs away allowing Ronnie and Rae some privacy
The

two lovers stare into each others eyes and then
embrace

Rae peeks over Ronnies shoulder at Gill with an
expression
of dread Anger seizes her

RAE
This aint gonna work

RONNIE

RAE
I dont see why we gotta lie bout
it when you and I know this aint

RONNIE
(holds her face in
his hands)

Rae is shaking He grips her by the back of her neck
pushes their faces inches away Eye to eye
RONNIE
I gotta believe we can do this or I
aint gonna make it Rae
Rae sees the fear in his eyes She swallows her own

and nods

RAE
Okay Okay

They kiss passionately

RONNIE
I love you

Afraid of his swelling emotion Ronnie quickly breaks
from her

Rae watches as her love leaves in Gills pick-up

to follow she absently walks after the truck down the
drive

She stops Silence She is alone

An intense wave of sorrow hits like a kick to her gut
gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the

her tears

Rae drops to her knees right there in the gravel

hair falls in front of her face masking her grief
repeatedly --

burning

it

Her

is

dizzy

flush

Her shoulders shudder

Her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh
a nervous habit that has always accompanied this
sensation that consumes her

RAE
Shit

Tears come to her Shes not going to be able to stop
RAE
Goddammit Ronnie
(shouting in
frustration)
GODDAMMIT
Rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort
breathing is already out of her control The dizziness
already upon her The familiar burning
She inhales in gasps rocking back and forth on her
The late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy
RAE
(shaking her head)

Mm-mm

(meaning no)

Mm-mm Mm-mm
The scratching at her leg leaves a red mark She is
with anxiety Her teeth are clenched her face is
RAE

the
cafe He looks ill Each step is painful
RL (V0)
We do not question your divine plan
for us Oh God But in these times
when our spirit lies in shadow When
we are lost
Laz crosses to Roses booth -- the distance seems to
stretch

out into eternity

RL (V0)
We ask that you give us strength
Give us strength that surpasses all
understanding In your name we pray
Amen

MORNING

Laz tosses the bags inside his trash cans

Hes really hung over this morning His eyes squeeze
he grips his neck in pain

LAZARUS
Mmmmmmmmmm Mm

His eyes open They remain fixed beyond us The pain in
face is replaced with grave confusion

Rae lies on the side of the road

Her T-shirt and panties are damp from the early morning
her face caked with dried blood Her skin is deathly
her mouth open her eyes shut and swollen

Lazarus carefully steps toward her He leans down over
face

LAZARUS
Sweet Jesus

Rae coughs Laz flinches

INT LAZARUS HOME - LATE MORNING

The door slams against the wall as it swings open Laz
carrying Rae unconscious and limp in his arms

He lays her down on the couch by the radiator He pulls

quilt over her cold skin With a twist of the valve the
radiator moans to life

Laz takes out his bandana and cleans her face He tries
wake her

LAZARUS
Little lady Miss You need to open
your eyes for me Could ya do that

Her eyes open slightly -- just slits of white

LAZARUS
There we go There we go Just like

tries to calm her as her lungs fight for oxygen Laz
looks

scared as the coughing stops in a desperate wheeze
followed

by silence

Snot and spittle has run down the side of Raes face --
eyelids stick together as she tries to open them

There is a creak followed by another Rae has become
that someone is slowly walking up the front porch

The door opens Silhouetted in the days blinding light
white man in his 40s His face is indistinguishable to
affected gaze

Is this a dream

He stands above her and lights a cigarette The Zippo
clasps shut The man lowers it to his side where Rae

it clearly A bald eagle is printed on the side a

that makes Raes eyes open wide in horror

Her breath grows deeper -- a girlish plea This is no
its a nightmare

RAE
Mm-mm Mm-mm

A massive hand slaps down over her mouth Her crusted
eyes

peer above the hairy knuckles He sucks on the
cigarette A

red cherry blazes at the end The man pushes the
blanket off

of her and grips her panties

Raes eyes close She knows what is next In his

clenched

fist the panties are ripped off

RAE
NOOOOO

Rae flinches awake from the fever-induced nightmare and
falls

to the wooden floor drenched in sweat Weakened and
shaking

she scampers away finally collapsing in the kitchen
Her

hand reaches out and lands on the strings of Lazs
guitar on
the floor She grips the steel strings with her

trembling

fingers

A single bass note twangs as she passes out

Rae watches with intense curiosity as Laz tunes his

guitar
sitting at the table

LAZARUS
(takes another drink)
Aint played fore nobody in years

Laz slides his calloused fingers across the strings

spurring

the old guitar into an impressive wail Rae grips the

chair

LAZARUS
(plays as he remembers)
Funny how a sound just speak to ya
heart

A haunting slide guitar riff barks Rae has a physical
reaction to the music She is fascinated and fearful

LAZARUS
(thinks)
Wanted me some kids A whole mess of

was for another time
(takes a drink)
Theys this one spring I sawa
change in her Her breasts start
swellin up Come a few mornings I

Laz thinks for a moment Continues playing

LAZARUS

Come a day Rose say she had to go

When she come back

(hesitates)
They talk about a woman havin that
glow Couldnt see it no more She
took it away Cut it out

The guitars song turns dark Laz slides his fingers up
the
guitar strings lingering on low growns

LAZARUS
One night While she sleepin
Held a pillow in my hands I could
see myself killin her What evil in
my heart make me wanna kill her I
dont know Its that voice in me
Each time I think its gone he come
howlin back Devil or no I dont
know But I am a haunted man

Fear spreads across Raes face Laz is talking about
something
all too familiar

LAZARUS

Calls me when Im ailing When I
cant find my home lost in the pines
I calls it the Black Snake Moan

(he closes his eyes

and sings)
Mm-mm Got no momma nowMm-mm
Got no momma nowIts over late last
night dont need no momma now

Laz stops He sways back and forth with his eyes
closed Rae

hears the swell of the cicadas Her eyes dart to the
front

door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard
RAE
Sing Lazarus
(kneels next to him
in fear)
Please keep singin

The door swings open A white calloused hand appears
around

Raes mouth

She gasps in terror clutching Lazs leg The white
hand is

gone Tears come to her She trembles as Laz sings

LAZARUS
(singing)
Mm-mm Black snake crawlin in my
roomMm-mm Black snake crawlin

Rae rests her head against his knee

LAZARUS
(singing)
Black snake is evil black snake is

Laz concludes the song Rae raises up to her knees
facing

Laz Tears have run down his dried face He opens his
eyes

LAZARUS
My life is gone Only life I was
livin And I lost it

RAE
Im here with you

LAZARUS
I had love in my heart And I gave
it to one woman And she gone now

Rae gently touches his cheek The wind picks up
outside
to

the

between

hands

arms
against the
face up

it

Rae in

his

pages

falls

You can give it to me
Rae kisses Laz He is motionless at first allowing it
happen His hand moves from the neck of his guitar to
bend in her neck
The passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar
them
Laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his

They are so close they are breathing into each others
mouths

RAE
You cant start this and not finish
Not with me
(kisses him)

Please
The guitar clangs to the floor as Laz lifts Rae in his
They kiss ravenous for each other He knocks up
side table causing his Bible to fall to the floor
and open The wind pushes the front door open slamming
hard against the wall
They turn together kissing Laz slowly spinning with
his arms But Laz is soon distracted by the pages of
Bible fluttering on the floor The wind is blowing the

turning them with an unseen hand

LAZARUS
Wait I gotta stop
(Raes kisses get
more aggressive)
Rae stop
(she cant hear the
burning has her)
Dammit Rae GET OFF

It takes a considerable effort to pull Rae away She
to the floor dizzy and sucking in air

LAZARUS
This aint the way for me Im sorry

Rae is struggling for breath She desperately grabs at
Laz

RAE
Not gonna lie to you Laz
(labored breath)
This ones a doozy I dont think
I dont think I can stop this

Her eyes roll back briefly almost losing

consciousness Laz
catches her and holds her tightly

LAZARUS
Tell me what to do

RAE
(Barely able to speak)
The chain helps

Laz grips the chain and wraps it around Rae

As the burning increases Laz holds Rae tight across
his
lap his back up against the radiator

RAE
I seen a man die He couldnt
breathe his heart was was givin
out

LAZARUS
You just havin a fit You aint

RAE
He told me get help I just stood

Her legs itch like they are covered in ants The wave
is
hitting her hard Laz holds her face up to him
RAE

(like a little girl)
Oh Laz he hurt me He hurt me
so many times

LAZARUS
No ones gonna hurt you no more

RAE
You think God forgives people like

(crying like a child)
You think God forgives people like
me

Suddenly aware of the rising burn Rae grits her teeth

RAE
Hold me Oh God

Rae turns away as Laz holds her head in his lap She

bites
down on his middle finger as his hand moves over her
mouth
She is gasping screaming into his hand
It hits Laz holds her
Raes open mouth quivers as the sensation peaks Her
shoulders
slump her chest vibrates She is crying softly
LAZARUS
Well just stay here Wait till it
passes
The pages of the Bible flip to the final pages in the
wind
