EXT OPEN SEA - DAY

Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST leaving a wake that

leads
EXT BERK - DAY
(Sequence 0200 - New Berk)
To the island village of Berk festively adorned with flags
and banners Major new additions alter its familiar
skyline
HICCUP (VO)
This is Berk The best kept
secret this side of well
anywhere Granted it may not look
like much but this wet heap of
rock packs more than a few
surprises
ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP hiding nervously between buildings as
shadows of passing dragons race by The group moves as one
receding into a shadowy alley pushing one sheep out into
the

light Its suddenly snatched and carried into the air
neck

MEATLUG

HICCUP (VO)

Life here is amazing just not for
the faint of heart See where most
folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
or needlepoint we Berkians prefer

a little something we like to call--

WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by
DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed Their RIDERS SWIPE
KICK and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in
between the houses docks and revamped structures of Berk
HICCUP (VO)
DRAGON RACING
Its like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race
Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers fastened to cliff
faces and perched over the sea
FISHLEGS now 20 and even larger rides his gronkle
who carries the sheep in her claws until

SNOTLOUT also 20 but every bit as juvenile and his
Monstrous Nightmare HOOKFANG steal the sheep from them

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 2
SNOTLOUT

Oh Im sorry Fishlegs Did you

want that
FISHLEGS

Snotlout Thats mine
Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT who lag on
their two-headed Zippleback BARF and BELCH

SNOTLOUT
Here ya go babe
Ruffnut

sheep

With a chivalrous grin Snotlout tosses the sheep to
She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE

SNOTLOUT (CONTD)
Did I tell you that you look
amazing today “Cause you do

RUFFNUT
Come on Barf Its starting to
stink around here
Barf starts to peel off spewing gas Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
with a mugging grin

TUFFNUT
Nope Still hates you Lets blow
this place Belch
Belch ignites the gas sparking a flashy explosion and
leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke
As they rush past the main bleachers Ruffnut DROPS her

into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap

crossing Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
dragon The BarfBelch basket filled to the brim with sheep
Presiding over the game STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd

STOICK
Thats nine for the Twins Astrid
lags with three Fishlegs and
Snotlout trail with NONE
Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end its backboard
painted with an image of Toothless

STOICK (CONTD)

And Hiccup is nowhere to be

found Hmmm

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 3
GOBBER

Scared him off with the big talk

didnt ya Stoick
WHACK Snotlout still smoldering from the blast gets
CLIPPED from behind ASTRID rolls in astride STORMFLY --

spirited and competitive as ever and beautiful despite
herself
ASTRID
What are you doing Snotlout
Theyre going to win now

SNOTLOUT
Shes my princess Whatever she
wants she gets

ASTRID
Ruffnut Didnt she try to bury
you alive

SNOTLOUT
Only for a few hours
BACK TO THE RACERS as they peel away pouring on the speed

HICCUP (VO)

Dragons used to be a bit of a

problem here But that was five

years ago Now theyve all moved

in And really why wouldnt they
The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
into a vast cave teeming with colorfully painted dragon
stables They exit through the far side and circle back
through the village blasting past many of its dragon-
friendly additions

HICCUP (VO)

We have custom stables all-you-
can-eat feeding stations a full
service dragon wash

In the village a baby Gronkle sneezes accidentally setting
one of the Viking houses aflame

HICCUP (VO)

Even top-of-the-line fire

prevention if I do say so myself
Astrid rolls her eyes peels away from the other dragon
racers and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
aqueducts dousing the flames with a surge of water

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 4

BACK TO STOICK amused as he watches the racers round the
island searching for sheep He turns to Gobber and nods
STOICK
Its time Gobber

GOBBER
Righty-ho
(aloud to the crowd)
Last lap

A HORN sounds The racers all turn to each other excited

ASTRID
The black sheep Come on Stormfly
We can still win this thing

RUFFNUT
Come on Barf

TUFFNUT
Lets go

FISHLEGS

Go Meatlug
GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult

GOBBER
This is your big moment Have a
nice flight

He pulls the trigger LAUNCHING the black sheep into the

air
Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb
toward
it
ASTRID
Up up up

In a flash Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past NABBING the
sheep
ASTRID (CONTD)

FISHLEGS
Good job Meatlug
Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut

FISHLEGS (CONTD)
Here you go darling Mines worth
ten
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 5

RUFFNUT
Yeah The Black Sheep
Snotlout sighs frustrated

ASTRID
You guys are fighting for Ruffnut

RUFFNUT
Im totally winning

Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile

FISHLEGS
Were winning together
She RAMS BARF into Meatlug sending Fishlegs into an
uncontrolled SPIN He SLAMS into Snotlout sending their
dragons TUMBLING head over tail The crowd goes wild

RUFFNUT
No one can stop me now

TUFFNUT
Except for me Were attached
genius

He GRABS at the sheep Ruffnut fights back inciting a tug-
of-
war

TUFFNUT (CONTD)
Quit trying to steal all my glory
And while theyre distracted Astrid steers Stormfly toward
them CLOSING IN

STOICK
Get ‘em Astrid

TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
Its MY glory No sheep no Youre always ruining
glory EVERYTHING
Astrid leaps off of Stormfly runs up Belchs spindly neck
and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins hands

ASTRID
Gotcha

She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly sticking a
perfect
landing black sheep in hand

RUFFNUT
Astrid
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 6

BACK TO STOICK beside himself The crowd ROARS

STOICK
Well played Hahaha
(gloating to the crowd)
Thats my future daughter-in-law

BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY

eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE unaware as
FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly sending Astrid
off-course She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
toward her war hammer cocked aiming at Astrid

SNOTLOUT
Uh excuse me
black

of

through

ASTRID
Stormfly
Snotlout HURLS his hammer Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
out of the way The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
a CLANG The crowd collectively winces

Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll loop over the
water and they BLAST past the finish line DUNKING the

sheep into their basket

STOICK
Thats thirteen Astrid takes the
game
The crowd COMES UNHINGED Astrid flies over the crowd
basking in her victory

HICCUP (VO)

Yep Berk is pretty much perfect
All of my hard work has paid off
And its a good thing too because
with Vikings on the backs of
dragons the world just got a whole
lot bigger

EXT OPEN SKYISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

(Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
A boundless sky Vast Clear Crisp And from it a BLACK
SPECK rockets across the horizon The image of unbridled
freedom

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 7

Tucked into his riding position HICCUP appears to be part

TOOTHLESS They dip roll and dive over a sea teeming with
Thunderdrums pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
refinement making them seem effortless

HICCUP
Yeah
They jackknife heading skyward rolling and tumbling
the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying

Timberjacks

face-

extends

as they soar in formation

Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug aerodynamic flight
suit -- an asymmetrical functional design of leather and
articulated plates It has an air of Viking bike leather

HICCUP (CONTD)
What do you think bud Wanna give
this another shot

Toothless grumbles in protest

HICCUP (CONTD)
Toothless Itll be fine
With a click of a lever he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
tail position Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle

HICCUP (CONTD)
Ready
Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically
Suddenly Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless peeling away from
him like a skydiver from a plane YELLING as he plummets

Toothless dives after him They spiral through the air

to-face Toothless is having fun despite himself
Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
flaps and YANKS unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he

his arms They catch the wind SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS
and sending him GLIDING -- out of control at first then
stabilizing The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily
But hes flying

Toothless unfolds his wings too catching up with Hiccup
The freedom is palpable Hiccup and Toothless are for the
moment the same Feeling the same rush of adrenaline
Independently together

They PLUNGE past cloud formations splitting apart then
crossing paths again

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 8
Impressive as it is Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle
Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup boosting him
higher with the expanding heat bursts

HICCUP (CONTD)
This is amazing
A cloud layer washes past exposing a towering ROCK
FORMATION dead ahead

HICCUP (CONTD)
No longer amazing Toothless
Hiccup tries to steer himself away to no avail
Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED trying to catch Hiccup as he
HURTLES toward collision His locked tail makes maneuvering
difficult Hes UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle

HICCUP (CONTD)

Oh no
At the last second Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
ahead of Hiccup then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
through it The obliterated peak rains down around them
Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
into the trees of a neighboring peak They tumble down the
uneven terrain coming to rest on a small plateau

Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless wings He
switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
stows his leather wings

HICCUP (CONTD)
That really came out of nowhere
The blown up sea stack collapses

HICCUP (CONTD)

We gotta work on your solo gliding

there bud That locked-up tail

makes for some pretty sloppy rescue

maneuvers eh

Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet
revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair complete
with a Viking braid

He walks to the edge of the cliff taking in the NEW LAND
stretching off into the horizon its tall cliffs and sea-
stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
and

dappled afternoon sunlight
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 9

HICCUP (CONTD)
Looks like we found another one
bud
Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS not amused shaking off dust

pebbles like a wet dog
Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
head He looks back to Toothless who averts his eyes

HICCUP (CONTD)
Oh what Do you want an apology
Is that why youre pouting big
baby boo Well try this on
Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock

HICCUP (CONTD)
Ya feeling it yet Huh Picking up
on all my heartfelt remorse
Toothless simply stands on his hind legs lifting Hiccup off
of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliffs edge

HICCUP (CONTD)
Oh come on You wouldnt hurt a

ONE- LEGGED --

Hiccup looks down seeing the precipitous drop below

HICCUP (CONTD)
Youre right Youre right You
win You win
WHAM Toothless flips him over pinning him to the ground
Hiccup squirms throwing mock punches Toothless playfully
retaliates with feline taps to Hiccups head

HICCUP (CONTD)
Hes down And its ugly Dragons
and Vikings enemies again locked
in combat to the bitter -- URFFF
Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
of him Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup
lapping at his face and covering him in slobber
HICCUP (CONTD)
Gaaaaagh

Hiccup fights to get free finally springing to his feet and
shaking off the viscous saliva
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 10

HICCUP (CONTD)
You KNOW that doesnt wash out

Toothless LAUGHS pleased with himself

Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
before them Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
produces a leather-bound book

He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP modified with

added

strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-
expanding

world Drawings indicate new lands new tribes and many new

dragons

Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in
his

flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick

Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the maps outer edge
then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
forearm

HICCUP (CONTD)
So what should we name it
Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing preoccupied

HICCUP (CONTD)
Itchy Armpit it is
Hiccup carefully draws the new islands outline

HICCUP (CONTD)
Whaddya reckon bud Think we might
find a few Timberjacks in those
woods The odd Whispering Death or
two in the rocks Who knows
maybe well finally track down
another Night Fury

(BEAT)
Wouldnt that be something

(BURDENED)
So whaddya say Just keep going
Toothless ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP He ROARS and his
call is answered by a familiar SCREECH Hiccup turns to
see

EXT SEA STACKISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

(Scene 0325 - AWOL Part Two)

ASTRID rising into view astride Stormfly Stormfly grabs
talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 11
HICCUP

“Afternoon mlady Where have you

been

Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless
rushes up to greet them

ASTRID
Winning races What else The real
question is where have YOU been
HICCUP

Avoiding my dad

ASTRID
Oh no What happened now
Astrid sits beside Hiccup inspecting his latest addition to
the map Behind them Toothless greets Stormfly inciting a
play fight

HICCUP
Oh youre gonna love this I wake
up The suns shining Terrible
Terrors are singing on the rooftop
I saunter down to breakfast
thinking all is right with the
world and I get

He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest

HICCUP (CONTD)

(APING STOICK)
Son we need to talk

Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccups sloppy slouch
ASTRID

(APING HICCUP)
Not now Dad Ive got a whole day
of goofing off to get started

Hiccup breaks character grimacing at her impression of him

HICCUP
Okay first of all I dont sound
like that What is this character
And second what is that thing
youre doing with my shoulders

Astrid laughs jostling her shoulders in an awkward way
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 12
HICCUP (CONTD)
A truly flattering impersonation
Anyway he goes
(resuming Stoicks brogue)
Youre the pride of Berk son and
I couldnt be prouder

ASTRID
(continuing her impression

OF HICCUP)
Aw thanks Dad Im pretty
impressed with myself too

HICCUP
WHEN have I ever done that with my
hands

ASTRID
You just did

She laughs playfully

HICCUP
Okay just
(holding her arms mock-

STERN)
Hold still Its very serious

She giggles trying to hold a straight face

HICCUP (CONTD)
(resuming Stoicks brogue)
Youre all grown up and since no
chief could ask for a better
successor Ive decided--
Astrid straightens her face brightening

ASTRID
--TO MAKE YOU CHIEF Oh my gods

She jumps to her feet beaming

ASTRID (CONTD)
Hiccup thats amazing

And socks Hiccup in congratulations deliberately hitting
the

dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up She

laughs as Hiccup reels it back in self-consciously

HICCUP
Youre gonna wear out the spring
coil The calibration is very
sensitive
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 13

Theyre suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly

HICCUP (CONTD)
Yeah so this is what Im
dealing with

Astrid helps him up and dusts him off

ASTRID

(EXCITED)
What did you tell him

HICCUP
I didnt By the time he turned
around I was gone

Astrid picks up the map folding it as she paces around him
processing it all

ASTRID
Well its a lot of responsibility
The map will have to wait for sure
and Ill need to fly Toothless
since youll be too busy

She pauses wincing in sympathy She turns to Hiccup He
nods
knowingly taking the map from her

HICCUP
Its not me Astrid All those
speeches and planning and running
the village thats his thing

ASTRID
I think youre missing the point I
mean chief What an honor Id be
pretty excited
Hiccup shakes his head

HICCUP
Im not like you You know exactly
who you are You always have
But

He shuffles to the cliffs edge gazing out at the new land

HICCUP (CONTD)
Im still looking I know that Im

not my father and I never met my
mother so what does that make
me

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 14
He sits at the edge looking burdened restless Astrid

approaches and settles beside him joining him in looking
out

at the distant horizon She weaves another braid into his

hair as she speaks

ASTRID
What youre searching for isnt
out there Hiccup

She places a hand on his chest

ASTRID (CONTD)
Its in here

(BEAT)
Maybe you just dont see it yet

She kisses his cheek but gets a mouthful of Toothless
slobber She grimaces wiping it off

Distracted Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly

HICCUP
Maybe But yknow there is
something out there

ASTRID

(EXASPERATED)
Hiccup

He turns her face to the horizon A distant smoke plume
rises
from a misty valley
through

and

EXT LAPLAND WOODSTRAPPERS FORT - MOMENTS LATER

(Scene 0400 - Shot Down)
Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord winding deep

undulating crimson and gold forests

Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly
give way to charred timbers They fly deeper through ash

wafting smoke Ahead in a sheltered harbor an explosion of
ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPERS

FORT

HICCUP
Stay close

They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings
splintered and frozen in mid-destruction

HICCUP (CONTD)
What happened here
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 15

Its at once harrowing and puzzling Toothless spots an
enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below
leaving him uneasy

HICCUP (CONTD)
Easy bud

As they crest the ice formations Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN
at the stern of a moored ship below
ASTRID
Hiccup

ERET (0S)
Fire

The men fire a stern-mounted cannon The projectile unfurls
into a NET Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way

HICCUP
Astrid Look out

It HITS Stormfly TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin
uncontrolled Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE
toward a collision

ASTRID

HICCUP

Astrid falls off of Stormfly but Toothless SNATCHES her at
the last second

Stormfly hits the ground tangled in the net Trappers rush
out of hiding piling onto her with ropes and weapons She
whips her tail sending spikes flying

ERET
Watch the tail

A large raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of
spikes

and lands upon Stormflys head twisting it and taking her

down like a rodeo cowboy
ERET (CONTD)
Tie those legs up

Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut wrangling her into
submission -- clearly a pro among pros He looks up

revealing a handsome face and gleaming intelligent eyes
that

search the sky as Toothless tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings
out

ERET (CONTD)
Is that what I think it is
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 16

Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky banking and
landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR

HICCUP

STOP

ASTRID

STORMFLY
(to the trappers)
What are you doing

Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless rushing toward
Stormfly

Erets men immediately draw weapons Hiccup extends and
ignites his DRAGON BLADE -- a telescoping fiery sword --
impressive enough to wow Erets men

ERET
Back again
Eret steps forward focused only on Toothless

ERET (CONTD)

Soil my britches that is a Night
Fury Thought they were all gone
for good

(to his fellow trappers)

Looks like our lucks had a turn
for the better lads Dont think
Drago has one of those in his
dragon army

His men sound out in agreement Hiccup eyes Astrid
confused

ASTRID
Dragon army

HICCUP
Look we dont want any trouble

ERET
Ha You shouldve thought of that
before you stole all of our dragons
and blasted our fort to bits

HICCUP
Wait

ASTRID
What are you talking about

Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction putting it
together
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 17
HICCUP
You think we did this

ERET
Dragon trapping is hard enough work
as it is without do-gooder dragon
riders sneaking in to rescue them

HICCUP
What do-gooder -- there are other
dragon riders

ERET

You mean other than your thieving
friend from last night You tell
me

Eret approaches Toothless snarls protectively

ERET (CONTD)
You may have an ice-spitting dragon
on your side but we still have a
quota to fill How do you suppose
we explain this mess to Drago
Bludvist

HICCUP
Drago what-fist Does anything you
say make sense

TEENY
Hes expecting a new shipment of
dragons for his army by tomorrow

NO-NAME
And Drago dont take well to
excuses
Eret parts his tunic revealing a large branding-iron scar
on
his torso in the shape of a dragon skull split by a sword

ERET
This is what he gave me last time I
showed up empty-handed He promised
to be far less understanding in the
future

HICCUP

(EXASPERATED)
Look we dont know anything about
a dragon thief or an ice-spitting
dragon or your lunatic boss and
his dragon army okay

(MORE)
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 18

HICCUP (CONTD)
Just give us back our dragon and
well go strange hostile person
whom weve never met

Eret bows playfully

ERET
Oh where are my manners Im Eret
Son of Eret Finest dragon trapper
alive

He pulls a dagger from behind his back waving it cockily
His men ready their weapons and net cannons

ERET (CONTD)
After all its not just anyone who
can capture a Night Fury
Toothless ROARS a warning

HICCUP
And this is Toothless He says
were going Now

ERET
Heh They all say that

(BEAT)
RUSH “EM LADS
Eret lunges toward them Toothless BLASTS bringing down a

massive spire of ice It shatters as it hits the ground
forcing Eret and his men to dive out of the way

Making quick use of the distraction Hiccup re-ignites his
dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding Stormfly

ASTRID
Stormfly Cmon go Go

Eret gets to his feet in time to see Toothless and Stormfly
take to the air carrying Hiccup and Astrid out of reach of
the volley of arrows

ERET
YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE
DRAGONS YOU HEAR ME DRAGO IS

COMING FOR THEM ALL

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 19

The GANG joyrides past GOTHIS house scattering her

assortment of terrible terrors She waves a fist at them as
they sweep past WHOOPING AND CHORTLING leading us down
t oe

THE UPPER PLAZA where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their
dragons are cued up outside of Gobbers BLACKSMITH STALL
awaiting their turns Stoick maneuvers through the crowd
spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing

He makes a bee-line for GOBBER who is busily grinding a
metal dragon tooth into shape A Zippleback waits patiently
his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head
watches sympathetically

STOICK
Any sign of him

Gobber flips up his welding guard revealing a matching area
of unsoiled skin

GOBBER
Ah hes probably flown off the
edge of the world by now You sure
you want that kid running the
village You can still delay your
retirement

STOICK
Oh hes ready Youll see

A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrids
return They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly
STOICK (CONTD)
Haha There he is
(to Gobber proving his

POINT)
Huh The pride of Berk

Hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with
urgency

GOBBER
Who finally decided to show up for
work Yay

HICCUP

Sorry Got held up
(privately to Stoick)
Hey Dad could I have a word

STOICK

Something youre itching to tell

me

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 20
HICCUP

Not quite the itch youre thinking
of but yes

Stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk

STOICK
Good man Now lesson one A
chiefs first duty is to his
people So

Stoick changes the rune on the being served placard
STOICK (CONTD)
Forty one Forty --

HICCUP
Could we just talk in private for--

STARKARD
--Thats me Thats me Im next
(pushing his way through)
I was ahead of you Excuse me Ive
been here all day

STARKARD reaches the counter giddy with excitement

STARKARD (CONTD)
Okay I want one of those high
seaters with lots of spikes anda
big stowage compartment

STOICK
Absolutely You got it sir

Stoick spins Hiccup around steering him back into the shop

HICCUP
Dad this is actually a little more
important than building saddles

STOICK
Ah-ah Lesson two No task is too
small when it comes to serving your
people Excuse us Grump

They step over the tail of a large snoring oaf of a dragon
stirring him awake with a fussy start
GOBBER
Grump You let the forge die down
again
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 21

Grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge It

splatters everywhere igniting a rash of fires Hiccup side-

steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall

Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher dumping water
everywhere

GOBBER (CONTD)
Thats it Grump Youre going up
for adoption

Stoick fills a toolbox with tools from Hiccups workbench

STOICK
One of these And this

HICCUP

DAD --

STOICK
-- There you go Go on Have away

HICCUP
But seriously I really need to
tell you about this new land we
came across

GOBBER
Another one
Fishlegs walks in followed by the Twins and Snotlout

FISHLEGS
Any new dragons

Stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold and
hands

Hiccup pencil Exasperated Hiccup begins tracing an outline

as he speaks

HICCUP
We didnt stick around to find out
These folks werent particularly
friendly

GOBBER
Oh really Your Night Fury and
Deadly Nadder didnt bring them
cheering to the rooftops

Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser

HICCUP
No this was different Not the
standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha
Ive come to enjoy These guys were
trappers Dragon trappers
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 22

ASTRID
You shouldve seen their fort All
blown apart and stuck in giant
spikes of ice It was weird

HICCUP
Ive never seen anything like it
And worst of all they thought we
did it

Gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire
brush
from his dispenser

GOBBER
Yknow you two are gonna get
yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one
of these days Not everyone
appreciates this way of life

Which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows

Stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw

STOICK
Gobbers right son Best we keep
to our own Besides youll have
more important uses for your time --

And pulls a lever starting it up

STOICK (CONTD)
(sing-songy under his

BREATH)

Once we make the big announcement

Hiccup pulls the lever shutting the saw down
HICCUP

They are building a dragon army

Silence fills the stall Vikings exchange worried glances

HICCUP (CONTD)
Or at least the guy they work for
is Dargo Bloody Fist or something

Stoicks eyes widen He turns to Gobber with growing alarm

TUFFNUT
Ill bloody his fist with my face
if he tries to take my dragon

RUFFNUT

Or mine

HICCUP
Because some guy you knew is
stirring up trouble in some faraway
land

Stoick turns to Hiccup gravely serious

STOICK
Because Drago Bludvist is a madman
Without conscience or mercy And if
hes built a dragon army gods
help us all

Stoick continues on shouting orders leaving Hiccup stewing

STOICK (CONTD)
Get them into their pens Quickly

Hiccup chases around to confront Stoick

HICCUP
Then lets ride back out there
Well follow those trappers to
Drago and talk some sense into him

STOICK

glimpses of Lapland in its wake

Eret stands on the bowsprit eyeing the waves intently
searching the surface He turns toward the deck where his
crewmen man the gunwale cannons sights trained to the sky

Eret turns in the direction Ug is pointing to see a pair of
dragons flapping toward them

ERET

HEADS OFF THE PORT QUARTER

The crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back-lit
silhouetted dragons drawing ever closer

ERET (CONTD)
Net ‘em lads Take ‘em down

Eret loads a cannon and takes aim He spots Hiccup and
Astrid
riding the dragons His eyes narrow determined

ERET (CONTD)
Youre not getting away this time

Nets fly through the air Hiccup and Astrid outmaneuver them
and dive toward the ship landing on the deck with a
clatter
ERET (CONTD)
And here I was worried we might
turn up empty-handed

Astrid brandishes her axe in invitation Hiccup indicates
for
her to lower it then holds up his hands in surrender

HICCUP
Nope Its your lucky day We give
up

Erets crew exchange confused stares As does Astrid

HICCUP (CONTD)
Thats one Night Fury one Deadly
Nadder and

He dismounts Toothless and tosses a net over Astrid

escorts Astrid past the men to the open live well

He leads Astrid down the ladder She glares at him plainly
hating the plan
ASTRID
What are you doing

Toothless tries to follow them but Hiccup holds him back

HICCUP
Toothless stay

Hiccup flips the latch lowering the grate as Eret watches
confounded

HICCUP (CONTD)
The dragons dont really care for
cramped spaces so theyll just
hang out with you They wont be
any trouble

Erets men nervously direct their swords and spears toward
Toothless HE SNARLS

HICCUP (CONTD)
Unless you do that Wooden boat

A burst of flame erupts from the live well causing the

crewmen to jump back Hiccup thrusts his Dragon Blade
through

the grate

HICCUP
Oops Almost forgot Cant have
armed prisoners

ASTRID
How is this a plan

He retracts the blade and offers it up A crewman cautiously
takes it looking it over The pommel of the hilt is
expelling green gas

HICCUP
Just what every dragon trapper
needs One end coats the blade in
Monstrous Nightmare saliva The
other sprays Hideous Zippleback
gas All it takes is a spark and

A curious crewman clicks the lighter igniting the gas
Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck

HICCUP (CONTD)
Oh yeah there you go

Toothless paws at the embers

HICCUP (CONTD)
Once they see you as one of their
own even the testiest dragons can
be trained right bud

Toothless gurgles and falls over

ERET
Give me that

Eret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard
Stormfly bolts after it
ERET (CONTD)
What game are you playing

HICCUP
No game We just want to meet
Drago

And returns in a flash dropping it at Erets feet like a
fetching dog tongue wagging Eret throws it again
frustrated Stormfly returns with it just as quickly

ERET
Why

HICCUP
Because Im going to change his
mind about dragons

Eret and his crew LAUGH Astrid pokes out of the well

ASTRID
He can be really persuasive

Hiccup pets Toothless thoughtfully

HICCUP
Once youve earned his loyalty

KICKS off pulling his wing-suit flaps

Eret takes aim but Astrid SHOVES him throwing off the

Years ago there was a great
gathering of chieftains to discuss
the dragon scourge we all faced

INT VIKING HALL - NIGHT

A hulking cloaked figure strides confidently into fire-lit
hall interrupting a council meeting of Viking chieftains
His face is masked in silhouette

STOICK (VO)

Into our midst came a stranger from
a strange land covered in scars
and draped in a cloak of dragon
skin He carried no weapon and
spoke softly saying that he Drago
Bludvist was a man of the people
devoted to freeing mankind from the
tyranny of dragons

ON STOICK some twenty years younger seated in a throne
studying the impudent stranger with suspicion

STOICK (VO)

He claimed that he alone could
control the dragons and that he
alone could keep us safe if we
chose to bow down and follow him

The Viking council erupts in mocking laughter

STOICK (CONTD)
Until he wrapped himself in his
cloak and cried out Then see how
well you do without me

Drago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and
marches toward the door Above dragon fire rips through the
ceiling bringing down flaming timbers followed by dragons
covered in heavy metallic armor They BLAST FIRE as panic
ensues

The rooftop suddenly burst into
flames and from it armored
dragons descended burning the hall

Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless determined Eret
watches intently

Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick

This is what Im good at And if I
could change your mind I can
change his too

Come on

Toothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR leaving everyone
stirring in awkward silence

Astrid mounts Stormfly about to go after him

EXT SKY - NIGHT

(Scene 1100 - Ambushed)

Hiccup stares ahead frustrated as Toothless glides over a
bed of clouds glowing in the low Arctic sun

Hiccup YELLS then slumps back onto the saddle

Toothless recoils sensitive to Hiccups upset The steam
from their breath mixes in the frigid air

HICCUP

Dont worry bud Im not gonna let

anything happen to you I promise

Toothless ear plates perk up He glances over his shoulder
to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds
A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the

clouds

standing upon something unseen Its armor and cape flap in
the buffeting turbulence

The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup pulling up alongside
them Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery
and sits up flustered

HICCUP (CONTD)

AW COME ON DAD REALLY

He whirls around expectantly then FREEZES mouth agape
The warrior stares blankly tilting his head in curiosity
while cutting a menacing silhouette

Then just as gradually as he rose the warrior dips back
beneath the clouds disappearing

Okay

No sudden moves
Suddenly the warrior EXPLODES out of the clouds before

standing atop a large dragon They circle Hiccup and
Toothless forcing them to TREAD AIR

The warrior points a staff toward Hiccup unnervingly as he
returns to face them
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 35

Hold on hold on
Toothless GROWLS a warning
Suddenly theyre ambushed from behind Hiccup is plucked

of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off

HICCUP (CONTD)

With the tail unmanned Toothless PLUMMETS helplessly He
FLAPS wildly then CRASHES through the ice into the black
frigid water FLAILING and CRYING OUT he struggles to stay
afloat as he watches

Hiccup disappear into the night sky carried off in the
talons of the strange dragon -- one of TENS that accompany
the warrior in a cavalcade
Toothless BELLOWS in distress desperately trying to take to
the air As he LEAPS and CRASHES time and again
A group of SPINY DORSAL FINS split the ice carving a path
toward Toothless
Beneath the ice a pod of SEASHOCKERS approach two-headed
with Manta Ray like wings GLIDING silently in the gloom
Fixated on Hiccup Toothless is caught by surprise as the
Seashockers surface and DRAG HIM UNDER
Hiccups helmet bobs to the surface marking all that
remains

Hiccup shivers in the claws of the dragon surrounded by the
strange flock full of breeds hes never seen He looks back
for Toothless now long gone

HICCUP
HEY YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE
HE CANT FLY ON HIS OWN HELL
DROWN
The warrior offers no response seemingly immune to the cold
as he leads the dragon flock across the polar night -- an

alien landscape harsh and foreboding
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 36

Out of the fog looms an EPIC ICE FORMATION -- jagged

and similar to the icy aftermath of Erets fort but many
times its size

The DRAGON ESCORT dives into its jagged folds

INT DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

The WILD RIDE suddenly gives way to a MULTILEVEL CAVERNOUS
CHAMBER made of ice and columns of basalt rock Its heavily
populated with dragons of all kinds looming in the shadows

Hiccup is dropped in the center He scrambles to his feet
calling out into the darkness

HICCUP
We have to head back for my dragon

A HISSING dragon CLOSES IN sniffing leering aggressive

Hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade
waving a swirl of fire around himself The dragon pauses
intrigued and then watches hypnotically as Hiccup pacifies
him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade

The warrior watches keenly from the shadows

Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup Hearing
their hisses he quickly stows the blade replaces a
cartridge in its hilt then flips it around and sprays a
perimeter of Zippleback gas around himself He clicks the
lighter igniting a flash ring The testy dragons recoil

He then reaches through the smoke offering his open hand
The dragons re-approach sniffing him with calmed curiosity

ON THE WARRIOR

tilting his masked head curious He dismounts his

and approaches Hiccup

HICCUP (CONTD)
Who are you The Dragon Thief
Drago Bludvist

The warrior circles Hiccup in silence taking in his gear
his dragon blade his face

HICCUP (CONTD)
Do you even understand what Im
saying
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 37
The warrior whirls and HAMMERS his staff In response a
large dragon ASCENDS from the depths carrying

HICCUP (CONTD)
Toothless

Toothless is dumped on the ground next to Hiccup sopping
wet Hiccup rushes to him petting him reassuringly
Toothless coos in relief

HICCUP (CONTD)
Its okay Im glad to see you
too bud You really had me worried
there

The warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon In
response it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight
from their throats spotlighting Hiccup and Toothless

The warrior sets down his staff and shield then approaches
Hiccup cautiously and animal-like

Toothless SNARLS and circles Hiccup defensively but then
instantly yields to the strangers outstretched hand With a
quick disarming gesture the warrior lays Toothless down in
a state of bliss Hiccup is astounded

The warriors hand continues toward Hiccups face He
recoils but the warrior persists finding the faint scar on
Hiccups chin glinting in the firelight

The warrior GASPS and retreats a few steps

How is this possible

The voice is surprisingly female

furrowed and solemn

Framed by a hole in the ice a glistening object bobs on the
surface below Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK leading
Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it Stoick SNAGS it out of the
water Its Hiccups helmet

to the ground like a skilled acrobat

She inspects his talons as Toothless rolls onto his back
nuzzling her

Hiccup smiles astounded by Toothless affection for Valka

She checks his teeth They recede into the gums at her
touch

VALKA (CONTD)
And retractable teeth Ah
How did you manage to--

HICCUP

shot down and wounded

She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to
caress a few of her own rescued dragons

one of Drago Bludvists iron traps
This Raincutter had her wing sliced
by razor netting And this poor

to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY

the sting of remorse

She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace
overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring
waterfalls Half-submerged in the warm lake below a massive

In enthusiastic response Stormfly pops open her talons

surface

BEGIN MONTAGE

Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a
majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun

Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of
dragons -- nearly all of Valkas rescues -- are close on
their tail He turns back to his mother confused

HICCUP
Hey I thought we were going to
eat

VALKA

(with a mischievous grin)
Oh we are

She directs his gaze below where in the choppy water of the
fjord a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense
shoal of fish near the surface

Suddenly the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below scooping
the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the

It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless giving them a
fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing
back down into the sea

Valka laughs at Hiccups surprise as the hungry dragons race
for the flailing fish scooping them out of the air Hiccup
gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a
mouth full

EXT SNOWY SHORELINE - LATER
MONTAGE CONTINUES

Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow explaining the
various lands hes discovered during his explorations

HICCUP
And from Dragon Island I found
this archipelago

He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him but
she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in
the snow wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has
explored

HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 50

She returned to Hiccups side with a smile But his

amazement
is interrupted by Toothless joining in drawing all over
Valkas map with a giant icicle
Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles and Cloudjumper
sneers
EXT WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER
Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons carried skyward by a
strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline
cliff

One by one dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong
updraft popping their wings open like kites They ride the
wind and orbit around each other in a colorful mesmeric
dance Its clearly a form of dragon play

Hiccup lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind
laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumpers
wing and onto several others dragon-hopping from one to
another until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing

tip
to wing tip She then drops out of sight reappearing a
moment later standing atop Cloudjumper Hiccup is in utter
awe of her
Valka breathes in the frigid air Lets it out blissfully
VALKA
When Im up here I dont even feel
the cold I just feel
HICCUP
Free
She smiles at Hiccup He gleams back
VALKA
This is what it is to be a dragon
Hiccup
Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and
unbuckles himself Valka watches curious
HICCUP
Its all well and good to call
yourself a dragon
Hiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless pulling his stowed wings

Hiccup SOARS riding the wild air currents like an

hovering protectively
Hiccup grins pleased at having impressed Valka until he
realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision

a fast approaching mountain top

HICCUP (CONTD)
Oh no Toothless

But with his tail locked Toothless cant make the tight
jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup

Realizing that theyre in trouble Valka and Cloudjumper

on the speed All four of them collide just as they reach
mountain top sending them crash-landing in an explosion of
snow

They all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the

swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING

HICCUP (CONTD)
Man Almost We just about had it
that time

Toothless raises his snow-packed face glowering He tail-
swipes Hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder

Valka inspects Hiccups wing suit with utter fascination
VALKA
Incredible

HICCUP
Well not bad yourself

She caresses his cheek staring deep into his eyes Hiccup
doesnt recoil this time

VALKA
All this time you took after me
And where was I

(REMORSEFUL)
Im so sorry Hiccup Can we start
over Will you give me another
chance

Hiccup smiles a simple acknowledgement that all is
forgiven
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 52

VALKA (CONTD)
I can teach you all Ive learned
these past twenty years Like

Valka finds a spot at the top of Toothless neck and rubs in
a circular pattern In response his dorsal blades slowly
crack split and extend forming a pronounced aerodynamic
“v down the length of his back and tail

VALKA (CONTD)
Now you can make those tight turns

Toothless shudders as if experiencing a much-needed
chiropractic adjustment He bounds over to Hiccup giddily
retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a
new toy
HICCUP
Did YOU know about this

Valka smiles delighting in their mutual amazement

VALKA
Every dragon has its secrets

Toothless pounces around showing off to Cloudjumper who
seems thoroughly unimpressed

VALKA (CONTD)
And Ill show them all to you
Well unlock every mystery find
every last species together as
mother and son

(BEAT)
This gift we share Hiccup it
bonds us This is who you are son
Who we are We will change the
world for all dragons We will make
it a better safer place

HICCUP
That sounds amazing
She pulls him into a hug -- forceful bursting with emotion

Hiccup hugs Valka back They share a cathartic moment
before
Hiccup peels away from her

HICCUP (CONTD)
This is so great Now you and I can
go talk to Drago -- together

She chuckles incredulous
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 53

VALKA
What Theres no talking to Drago

HICCUP
But we have to --

VALKA
-- No We must protect our own

Hiccup stares exasperated by the familiar line Cloudjumper
lumbers over eager to be rid of Toothless puppy-like
energy Valka pets him

VALKA (CONTD)
Now come on we should be getting
back

Before Hiccup can say anymore he hear heavy breathing next
to him and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin
clapping his dorsal blades

EXT ICE CAVE - DAY

(Scene 1350 - Meet Drago)

Astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular
icebergs collapsed against each other at the mouth of a
maze Stormfly drops Eret to the snow but before he can
flee she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg
ERET
Agghh Okay I got you here now
get this thing off me

ASTRID
Never take a toy from a dragon
Dont you know anything

Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight

ERET

(STRAINED)
Gah Why does this keep happening
to me

Astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal

A MASSIVE FLOTILLA moored together like a floating camp in
the deep water between collided icebergs

Thick chains run deep into the water where great blasts of
bubbles erupt on the surface The unseen creature rocks the
ships Its effect alone describes it as gargantuan

takes wing BLOW DARTS whiz through the air hitting the
other dragons The effect is immediate -- they fall to the
ground unconscious Drugged

Eret spring to his feet and draws his blades Astrid and the
Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers camouflaged in
polar bear furs and poised to fire darts Theyre
outnumbered Fishlegs raises his hands dropping the cards

is masked by thick grizzled dreadlocks

Drago turns to see Astrid Eret and the Gang being forcibly
escorted onto the deck Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE

In the background a sledge loaded with Hookfang Meatlug
Belch and Barf -- all unconscious -- is dragged onto the

The soldiers disarm him pushing him forward as Drago
approaches
HTTYD 2 (D DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 050514 55

ERET (CONTD)
Well as you can see Im right on

just like I promised

Hookfang awakens groggily shaking off the effect of the

blow-
dart He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in
SOLDIER 1
Watch out Hes waking up Keep him
steady
SOLDIER 2
Give me some backup here
DRAGO
Drop the ropes
They do so Hookfang bucks and roars chasing off the
soldiers then focusing on Drago as he closes in The
armored

dragons avert their eyes and cower as Drago passes

Hookfang HISSES a warning but Drago approaches undaunted
dragon

Hookfang BLASTS In a blur Drago wraps himself in his

skin cloak The sticky napalm-like fire splatters against
the fireproof scales enveloping Drago in dripping flames as
he persists forward without missing a step

As the blast ends Drago drops the cloak closing in and
holding a cold stare Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR

Drago YELLS back with a fierce savage scream interrupting
Hookfang and causing him to recoil Drago whirls his bull-
hook overhead and STABS it into the deck planks

Hookfang stirs his aggression fading in the face of Dragos
unflinching show of dominance

After a moment Hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head
in submission Drago places his boot upon Hookfangs snout
pressing it into the deck planks

to the saddle on Meatlug Alarm flashes in Dragos eyes

ASTRID
Drago doesnt have them after all

path She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him

appear at Stoicks side

His words snuff her retort rendering her speechless She
softens despite herself yielding her cheek to his palm He

Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper commanding swarms of
dragons to swoop down and attack Dragos army A swarm of
Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon
wheels through the battlefield scattering soldiers and
destroying war machines

One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter but Hiccup
and Toothless double-back for a rescue

This is the great dragon master

The son of Stoick the Vast What
shame he must feel

Toothless snarls ready to blast but Hiccup calms him with

hand gesture

HICCUP
All of this loss and for what To
become unstoppable To rule the
world

Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup

HICCUP (CONTD)
Dragons are kind amazing creatures
that can bring people together

DRAGO
Or tear them apart

Drago LAUGHS mockingly then removes his FALSE ARM
revealing
a stump at his shoulder Hiccup is taken aback

DRAGO (CONTD)
You see I know what it is to live
in fear To see my village burned
my family taken
He reattaches the prosthesis circling Hiccup menacingly

DRAGO (CONTD)
But even as a boy left with
nothing I vowed to rise above the
fear of dragons and liberate the
people of this world

HICCUP
Then why a dragon army

DRAGO
(grinning smug)
Well you need dragons to conquer

He hurries back down the mountain after them

Drago points to Toothless The Bewilderbeast stares and
HISSES forcing Toothless to cower under a hypnotic
ultrasonic broadcast Toothless struggles against the

command writhing and grinding his head against the ground

HICCUP
Toothless You okay bud Whats
going on

Toothless fights the command shaking his head in protest
The Bewilderbeast insists with a mesmerizing glare anda
low throaty grumble until Toothless finally succumbs to
its control He raises his head his stare vacant and
robotic as his pupils turn to slits

Drago then points to Hiccup The Bewilderbeast responds
HISSING again at Toothless

Witness true strength The strength
of will over others In the face of

ON VALKA hearing the blast horrified

Drago glances back seeing Stoick laying lifeless in the
aftermath pleased by the sudden turn of events He shuffles
off satisfied

Stunned Hiccup comes to and sees Stoick in the rubble He
rushes past the still-entranced Toothless straining to

Toothless retreats like a scolded dog ear plates back and
head hung low Valka watches broken-hearted as Hiccup

upon Stoick inconsolable

VALKA
Its not his fault You know that

On the battlefield the alpha BELLOWS calling all of the
dragons to gather Meatlug Stormfly Hookfang and the

all follow the command as the Gang calls after them

Drago notices Toothless tumble down a snow-bank once again
slit-eyed and entranced but unable to fly to the alpha
without a rider Drago pins him down eyeing the saddle
pedals and prosthetic tail

May the Valkyries welcome you and
lead you through Odins great
battlefield May they sing your
name with love and fury so that we
might hear it rise from the heights
of Valhalla and know that youve
taken your rightful place at the
table of kings

Bows and pitch-dipped arrows are gathered from the
battlefield Gobber hands a set to Hiccup meeting his eyes
with sympathetic glance

GOBBER (VO)

For a great man has fallen A
warrior A chieftain A father A
friend

Hiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage
igniting the pitch that coats the tip

He releases his arrow which sails through the air and lands
on the deck of the ship where Stoick is laid out on a pyre
covered by a sail his axe upon his chest

The others follow Hiccups lead They DRAW BACK in unison
LOOSE their arrows filling the sky with crisscrossing
flaming streaks They arc over the lagoon and set the ship
alight

conceived

dragons

Toothless is steaming his black skin glowing blue with

his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat a glow
emanating from his flared nostrils

He turns back to Hiccup to check if hes unharmed then
turns his full attention back to the Bewilderbeast He leaps
out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire roaring
ferociously

The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront Toothless
unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeasts face
not letting up

HICCUP
Hes challenging the alpha

VALKA

To protect you
The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination
Toothless fires back time and again fully in control

The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice trying to

Toothless but he deftly spring from spire to spire
continuing his unrelenting attack

n the midst of the mayhem the horde of commandeered

-- both Berks and Valkas -- break free from the control to
witness Toothless retaliation

Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka commanding
the dragons to shift sides The follow amassing behind
Toothless

Seeing this Drago panics and rushes toward the
Bewilderbeast

He hammers the Bewilderbeast spurring it into a charge

Toothless calls over his shoulder commanding the dragons to
ready themselves He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast mid-
charge Suddenly Skullcrusher fires Followed by another
and another

Hiccup looks around amazed to see the flock of dragons
opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast Theyve started
a rebellion
Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking
cover in the tall spines of the giants crown

DRAGO (CONTD)

FIGHT BLAST THEM

His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own
armored dragons

The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice but
Toothless lets loose a powerful shot The Bewilderbeasts
head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball

As the smoke clears one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the
ground sheared clean off Drago glares at Toothless

Toothless ROARS commandingly calling an end to the fight

HICCUP
The alpha protects them all

new alpha and heeds Toothless command retreating into the
sea in an explosive splash

As the smoke clears Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but
bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance No sign of
the Bewilderbeast or Drago

Toothless hops down from the spire cooling off as people
celebrate all around them

All of the dragons -- Berks Valkas even Dragos -- land
around Toothless Cloudjumper bows to Toothless starting a
wave of bows acknowledging their new alpha

Viking symbol onto Hiccups forehead She bows

turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms

atop Skullcrusher
They fly past Hiccup and Toothless who are steadily
hoisting
a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where
workers

are rebuilding the damaged houses
Toothless

Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of
Stoick presently under construction He grins with pride

HICCUP (VO)

Those who attacked us are
relentless and crazy But those who
stopped them Oh even more so

He looks to the horizon scanning it from east to west to
ensure that no trouble is approaching

Astrid and Stormfly buzz past him playfully coaxing him to
join the game He smiles

HICCUP (VO)

We may be small in numbers but we
stand for something bigger than
anything the world can pit against
