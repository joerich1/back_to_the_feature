INT MEDIA CENTER AND WINDCOM - EVENING

Cubicles as far as the eye can see Deserted Not a
soul in sight except for ROSIE ADLER

A striking attractive woman Early 30’s Eyes snap
with intelligence and fire

Quick glance over her small domain reveals

A computer printer stacks of books diploma from
Vassar A poster of Albert Einstein sticking out his
tongue

A framed picture of an attractive older woman A home-
made title “The Blog Log” and

ON THE WALL
The call letters for the internet address -- WINDCOM

She looks at her computer screen Tons of e-mail All
letters to be answered Mutters

ROSIE
I hate this job

Pushes her chair back reaches under the desk and
retrieves a hidden Oreo stash Munches on one as she
reads

ROSIE (CONTD)
Dear John sometimes my boyfriend and I
go at it so hard that I’m afraid his
‘unit’ will snap right off That would
ruin everything for me

Rosie does a take Eyebrows arch
ROSIE (CONT’D)
Not to mention my boyfriend who probably
wouldn’t be all that happy either
Finishes the cookie
ROSIE (CONT’D)
Were desperate here What should we do

Yours trulySnap Crackle and Pop”

Rosie stares for a moment Sighs
ROSIE (CONTD)
For this I got a Masters’

She turns to the computer - types rapidly Very rapidly
considering she only uses the index finger of each hand

ROSIE (CONTD)
“Dear Snap Crackle and Pop If it does
snap off -- call Lorena Bobbit She’1ll
know what to do”

She stops Shakes her head Painstakingly deletes what
she just wrote

Scratches her head with a pencil flips it catches it
Starts again

ROSIE (CONTD)
“Honey you’re going to hurt yourself if
you keep this up Tell Mr Blue Steel to
slow down Enjoy the ride Both of you
Just because life’s short - doesn’t mean
everything else has to be Signed
John”

She whacks a couple of keys on the keyboard which in
turn starts the printer Paper comes out she snags it
shoots down the hallway

INT MANAGER’S OFFICE - EVENING

No knock just Rosie slamming through the door Throws
the paper at --

NICHOLAS MONROE

30s Well built Not a hair out of place GQ poster
boy

ROSIE
No more Nick Give me something
Anything I don’t care
(sits on his desk)
You owe me Monroe

NICK
Nice to see you too Rosie

ROSIE
C’mon Anything What do you say

Nick smiles enjoying the show
ROSIE (CONTD)
You know I’m a better than any of those
bozos you use now Take Dear John shove
a stick of dynamite up his ass and blow
him to hell I hate this social
networking crap and you know it

NICK
But you’re so good at it

ROSIE
Nick which rhymes with prick get me out
of this

She can’t believe it

NICK
Okay

ROSIE
Seriously

NICK

15 raise Retroactive to August

ROSIE
It’s not the money and you know it

She picks up his stapler which he promptly takes away

from her

ROSIE (CONTD)
I just want to write about something
that’s actually worth writing about

NICK
No can do

ROSIE
Bullshit You can do You “no wanna’
do”

NICK
Blame your success not me Look at
this

(taps I-pad)

Since you took over the “Dear John” blog
weve quadrupled our internet billings
Nobody “tweets” like you

ROSIE
And nobodys a “twit” like you
NICK
You’re irreplaceable

ROSIE
And you call yourself a manager

NICK
You think you can do my job

ROSIE
(tosses his pencils)
A chimpanzee could do your job

NICK
Sticks and stones

ROSIE
How did you get through college

Nick smiles puts his hands behind his head Loves this
little game they play - nods to the diploma on the wall

NICK
Probably saw me on ESPN All American
Notre Dame

ROSIE
Oh that’s right First string hunchback
NICK
Anything else
ROSIE
I quit
NICK

Contract I own you for one more year
dearestJohn

(looks at watch)
And now you have only twenty minutes to
finish

She drops the paper she printed on his desk

ROSIE
Dont believe everything you think

NICK
Youre certifiable You know that

ROSIE
Small price to pay for brilliance
He reaches in his desk drawer Holds a ring case
Tosses it to her She catches it one handed

NICK
I love you

She looks at it for a long beat

ROSIE
Then let me do something else

He smiles takes the ring from her slides the three-
carat beauty on her left hand

NICK
Five hundred words about internet
singles’ dating
(smile fades)
On “features” tweets by tomorrow morning

ROSIE
I don’t love you I’m just stupid

And she’s gone Nick smiles broadly to himself Exults
in having this power over her
INT CONDO - NIGHT

A discriminating but comfortable place Not unlike it’s
owner

KIRBY MITCHELL

Early 30s good looking Rumpled Not a slave to
fashion And a romance novelist

Barry White rumbles romantically in the background
ON THE FLOOR

a little terrier - Bernie Dog watches him quizzically
Kirby talks what he types

KIRBY
As he entered the room she was there
the most exquisite woman on the planet
Here just to be with him

His imagination he’s actually seeing Rosie Adler He
just doesn’t know it yet
Shoves his hand into a bowl of popcorn crams a fistful
into his mouth Sways to the music Has absolutely no
rhythm Zero

Starts typing again
KIRBY (CONTD)
He caresses her name with a breathy
seduction and she is overpowered He can
only gaze into the fire of her agate
eyes
Kirby stops closes his eyes Waits for the inspiration
KIRBY (CONTD)
Responsive to his touch her own hands
and lips eagerly sought out and explored
his being His soul His body

Kirby gets up - dances around the room slowly

INTERCUTDAYDREAM

In his mind he sees his love - someone who happens to
look exactly like Rosie - there with him

BACK AS
The dog watches bemused

Kirby dances into the kitchen Barry White rumbles on
There’s a crash Glass breaks

KIRBY (0S)
Dammit
(more pieces clatter)
My new crock-pot

Bernie the dog cocks his head Off his canine look

EXT MICHIGAN AVE - DAY

The sky lead gray and threatening Now the rain
Sheets of it

Kirby runs across the sidewalk carrying Bernie Both are
soaked

On the wall is a listing of companies One is Cole
McKenzie Publishing
AT THE REVOLVING DOOR

Kirby hustles through with Bernie - plows into Rosie
Full on Down she goes Kirby tries to help her up

KIRBY
I’m really sorry about

Then he sees her face Hits him like a dump truck The
woman of his dreams

KIRBY (CONTD)
This

Stunned he lets go of her hand She goes down like a
bad habit Second time

Kirby stands dripping on her When she does finally
right herself there’s fire in the eyes

ROSIE
What the hell are you doing

KIRBY
I know you

Exasperated Rosie brushes herself off

ROSIE
No you don’t

KIRBY
What’s your name

ROSIE
See

She notices how he’s dressed high top work boots No
belt Baggy Levis and plaid shirt Mayberry RFD

ROSIE (CONTD)
Gee where are Barney and Aunt Bee

KIRBY
Huh

She’s gone

KIRBY (CONTD)
Oh his name’s Bernie
(holds dog up)
Bernie
(to the dog)
That was her
Bernie gives him the same look Rosie did

INT ELEVATOR - DAY

Hot Latin number plays through the elevator speakers
Kirby taps his foot Missing the rhythm Doesn’t care
Now the shoulder lifts Sets the dog down

Boogie city He’s cool He’s a dude He’s “Kirby of no
Rhythm” as the door opens on --

THREE EXECUTIVE ASSISTANTS

Young hip women Everything the ‘dancing machine’ in
front of them isn’t

When Kirby finally notices his audience it’s thirty
seconds too late Made a total jackass of himself

He bends down grabs Bernie shoots past them The young
women look at each other -- crack up

INT COLE MCKENZIE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Kirby is staring again This time at a beautiful young
woman VALENTINA Maybe 25 with crimson collagen
injected lips

Under the tight pink sweater breasts roughly the size of
Vermont swell in unison

KIRBY
Hey Valentina

VALENTINA
Hi Mr Mitchell

KIRBY
Kirby

VALENTINA
Huh

KIRBY

Call me Kirby

VALENTINA
(broad smile)
I couldn’t do that

KIRBY
Why
VALENTINA
Silly You’re not a vacuum

She bends over the desk so low he can see to her knees
She giggles with delight Pets the dog

VALENTINA (CONT’D)
Hello little Bernie How are you
snookums

The dog backs away From his perspective this woman has
three heads

VALENTINA (CONTD)
He’s so precious

KIRBY
Yeah
VALENTINA
Mr Collier will be with you in a minute
(thinks)
Maybe more than that I’m never quite
sure

The way she says it Marilyn Monroe would be envious

KIRBY
Sure

He glances up at the small video camera mounted on the
wall Waves Sits down

Bernie pads over a New Yorker magazine in his mouth
Drops it on Kirby’s lap

KIRBY (CONTD)
I’ve read this one

Dog looks at him

NATE COLLIER bustles in Nice suit Late 50’s physique
like a sack full of doorknobs Whole package is topped
off with Hair Clubs’ latest glue-on

NATE
C’mon in
(to Valentina)
Hold my calls And keep the dog out
here Makes me sneeze

VALENTINA
Yes sir
(bends over again)
C’mon Bernie I wanna’ give you a love

Bernie cringes behind the sofa

Kirby and Nate take a moment to admire the two leviathan
scoops of a vanilla as she bends down to hug the dog

KIRBY
Love to bury my head in those

NATE
She has to cut her toenails from memory
you know

Nate leads him inside

INT OFFICE - SAME

The office reflects Nate’s money Marble and mahogany
Jalousie glass Distinctive and valuable objects d’art

NATE
I need the damned book already

KIRBY
That’s why you got me down here

NATE
I need the book Today

KIRBY
Why didn’t you just call me

NATE
Because you say whatever I want to hear
and still don’t deliver The friggin’
book Kirby Where is it

KIRBY
On my desk

NATE
Finished

KIRBY
Sort of

NATE

KIRBY
Yeah Kind of

NATE

KIRBY
It’s done
NATE

KIRBY
(shrugs )

I don’t know if I like the ending

NATE
Ending schmending Where is it

KIRBY
I’1l messenger it over Monday

NATE
Don’t screw with me Kirby

KIRBY
Believe me that’s the last thing on my
mind
(three fingers)
Monday Scout’s honor

NATE
Scout’s honor Really Really

KIRBY
If you’d just called I would have sent
it Could have saved myself the trip
(stands up)
I’m going

NATE
You’re mad

KIRBY
No I’m going

NATE
You’re mad because I yelled

KIRBY
No

Nate smiles ingratiatingly at him
NATE
Kirby you’re the best I love you you
know that

KIRBY
This is the last one

Nate looks at him like he’s suddenly acquired another
head

NATE
What

KIRBY
I’m tired of being a romance novelist

NATE
Not “a” romance novelist -- “the” romance
novelist of the friggin’ century Kirby

His jowls wag when he talks that fast

KIRBY
I writing about stuff I’ve never done

NATE
Who gives a rat’s ass It sells Big

KIRBY
I want to use my real name on the next
one

NATE

Are you out of your mind What the hell
for Nobody gives a shit about Kirby
Mitchell

(for emphasis)
Nicole’ Forrester on the other hand is
a verified New York Times best selling
author

(slams his fist)
The incredibly rich and reclusive Nicole’
Forrester Who no one has ever been able
to even catch a glimpse of in the last
three years

KIRBY
I want people to know who I am

NATE
I know who you are That’s enough This
is the world’s best gimmick Don’t screw
it up

KIRBY
My mind’s made up

NATE
Don’t do this to me

He scratches his scalp under the hairpiece with a
vengeance

NATE (CONTD)
Finish this novel and then we’ll talk
about it Okay

KIRBY
I’m serious Nate

NATE
As a heart attack I know

KIRBY
No you don’t

He goes to the door

NATE
What do you want from me

KIRBY
A reason to live

He walks out

NATE
What the hell does that mean

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kirby finishes shaving Wears a shirt so loud you can
hear it Polka dots Dog trots in with a Hathaway in
his mouth

Kirby bends down and grabs the shirt

LILY

KIRBY
I didn’t need to know that

LILY
You’re turning into him

penny loafers

INT EXCLUSIVE BAR - NIGHT

Dark mahogany Mood lighting People mingle easily
The bar is wall-to-wall singles

IN THE CORNER

Julia at a small table as Rosie comes to the bar leans
over it

Her cleavage too big a temptation for the Bartender to
resist He stares

ROSIE
That ride’s closed

His head snaps up

BARTENDER
Help you
JULIA
Two Absoluts
(points)

Over there Start a tab

She strides back to the table Bartender gives her a
look you could pour on a waffle

ROSIE
You’d date a married man

JULIA
Sure If he’s got a great ass and a
couple bucks Good smile’d be nice

ROSIE
That’s it

JULIA
He probably shouldn’t be a serial killer
either

ROSIE

But not mandatory

JULIA
I’m not gettin’ any younger

INTERCUT

Kirby is there Head never wavers Cracked glaze in his
eyes Just can’t help staring

JULIA (CONTD)
There’s some guy over there staring at
you

ROSIE
Cute

JULIA
Not bad

ROSIE

Married

JULIA
No ring

ROSIE
Rich

JULIA
I doubt it

ROSIE

Not interested

JULIA
He is

Kirby alternates watching her and looking around

INT BAR - LATER

Same exact look is still on Kirby’s face Hasn’t moved a
muscle Generally the crowd is livelier Drunker All
over each other

Julia dances with a young stud Tight butt neatly tucked
into a new pair of jeans Julia’s hands are all over
him

Rosie on the other hand is dancing with a middle-aged
bald guy

Music stops she ditches Baldy like a hand grenade
Julia weaves over

JULIA
I’m dumpin’ you

ROSIE
You’re drunk

JULIA

Youre right But the night is young
(waves at the stud)
And so is he

ROSIE
I’m impressed

JULIA
Nice ass huh

ROSIE
Very Goon I’11 hang out for awhile
Might find an angle for the blog
JULIA
Only angle I’m after is horizontal

She ricochets away Rosie sits whips out her I-phone
INTERCUT

Taps out a “TWEET” under the pseudonym Inkman
“Seriously Is there anybody out there”

She pockets the phone tosses off the rest of her drink
as --

A DRUNK
long-hair roady-type approaches taps her shoulder

DRUNK
I’m out here

Holds his hand out

ROSIE
That was the fastest ‘tweet’ answer ever

DRUNK
Whaddya’ say

He weaves in place

ROSIE
And the fastest reply -- no

DRUNK
You turnin’ me down

ROSIE
And off

He reaches down grabs her by the elbow

DRUNK
Wrong answer

He pulls her out of her seat like a shot and into dance

so hard his teeth rattle

He’s too drunk for that Pissed he starts to swing his
fist when --

KIRBY’S HAND

stops him mid-punch Spins him around

position in one move Actually not bad Rosie slaps him

KIRBY

She doesn’t dance with anything outside

her species
Kirby swings - misses Drunk swings - connects
Kirby’s eye Yeowww He staggers back swings blindly
Lucks out Catches the guy squarely on the chin
Drunk hits the floor Takes an instant dirt nap
The crowd surges Kirby takes Rosie’s hand pulls her
out

EXT OAK STREET - NIGHT

They walk down the street in silence He’s getting a
black eye and she’s buzzed

Neither utters a word for half a block

ROSIE
Thanks For back there
KIRBY

ROSIE

How’s your eye

KIRBY
(touches it)
A little left of center

ROSIE

KIRBY

ROSIE

(stops flushed)
Kirby right

KIRBY

ROSIE
Kirby what are you doing tonight

Before he can answer Rosie plants a killer kiss
Tongues and everything

OVER WE HEAR
The entire Mormon Tabernacle Choir sing “Hallelujah”

ROSIE (CONTD)
Whoa

KIRBY
Why’d you do that

ROSIE
Your lips They’re kissable Can’t pass
up “kissable” these days

Kirby kisses her back Big time Rosie’s eyes fly open

Another “Hallelujah” as it begins to pour He grabs her
hand
KIRBY
Ill get a cab
ROSIE
I sing in the shower you know
KIRBY
Congratulations

Kirby pulls her down the street as he dials his cell

phone

As Rosie does an impromptu “Singin’ in the Rain” about
two keys off Blitzed

INT TAXI - NIGHT

Kirby looks out the window as the city’s neon blurs by
His face a study in mixed emotions

On his coat -- Rosie’s head out cold and snoring

EXT Kirby’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Kirby is greeted by his doorman RANDOLPH Big guy
Peaks inside the taxi

RANDOLPH

It’s not what you think

RANDOLPH
Thinking’s above my paygrade Your

RANDOLPH
(re Kirby’s eye)
What’s the other guy look like

KIRBY

Randolph gives him five then lifts Rosie out of the
She’s a limp rag

cab

EXT CHICAGO - MORNING (TO ESTABLISH)

The sun bleeds crimson as it touches the high rises on
Lake Michigan

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Door cracks open Kirby comes in pulls open the shades
He stands for a time just watching Rosie sleep And
snore His face softens Deep breath Heads into the
bathroom

INT BATHROOM - DAY

Looks in the mirror Puffy cheeks The Pillsbury
Doughboy with a shiner

Pulls his toothbrush Ouch Something painful about his
right hand

Looks his hand is bruised and swollen

Finishes loading the toothbrush gingerly begins
brushing

In a moment foamy lather around the mouth He glances
at the bedroom then back at his hand and finally the
mirror
KIRBY
Way to go queen of romance

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Rosie wakes up when the light hits her in the eyes
Blinks trying to adjust to the wattage and the hangover

Holds her throbbing head Can’t remember what happened
Black void in her brain

Her eyes dart around the room --
Clothes and bra are on the other side of the bed

ROSIE
It’s official I’m brain dead

Bernie bounds up on the bed

ROSIE (CONTD)
Who are you

Dog yaps as Kirby enters

KIRBY
Bernie

Rosie is surprised drops the dog pulls the sheet up to
her neck

KIRBY (CONTD)
How do you feel

ROSIE
Fine

Voice trails off She has no idea what his name is

KIRBY
Kirby

ROSIE
I’m fine Kirby

KIRBY
You don’t look fine

ROSIE
Iam This is my “fine” look

Wraps the sheet around her tries to stand Doesn’t
happen Not on the first try Or the second Finally
makes it

ROSIE (CONTD)

KIRBY
What there was left of it

ROSIE
With you

Kirby just nods Rosie checks the bra again

ROSIE (CONTD)

ROSIE

(to herself)
I never say great

She goes in the bathroom Door shuts on his chagrined
face

INT CAR - DAY

Music jamming on the car radio Loud Raucous

Just the opposite of what a hung-over woman would
generally choose It’s how she wakes up

A horn blares she swerves to narrowly miss hitting a
slow pedestrian

Jangles her a little Turns down the radio dials her
car phone wspeaker

ROSIE
Hey It’s me

JULIA (PHONE)
So I heard you left with a guy

ROSIE
That didn’t take long

JULIA (PHONE)

JULIA (PHONE)
You like him

ROSIE
He said I did
INT DOT COM OFFICE - DAY
Rosie marches past the cubicles No one really notices

Except a lanky six-foot four Texan named JACKSON SHAW
40s loud voice with a pronounced drawl

JACKSON
Well butter my butt and call me a
biscuit She’s back

ROSIE

If it isn’t God’s answer to lonely sheep
JACKSON

He’s been waitin’ on you sweet-cheeks
ROSIE

Good
JACKSON

All night

ROSIE
Not good
(stops short)
You sure

JACKSON
Darlin’ when the chips’re down the
cow’s empty

ROSIE
Good metaphor

Throws her shoulders back marches in

INT NICK’S OFFICE - DAY

NICK

ROSIE

NICK
There’s a surprise
ROSIE
I was drunk
NICK

You don’t drink

ROSIE

Nick looks up Always in control but the anger shows
NICK
I didn’t tell you to get involved

ROSIE
What’s that mean

NICK
You asked to do a twitter story I gave
you one You screwed it up

ROSIE
Prick

NICK
Goes with the territory

And you met someone

ROSIE
I meet a lot of people

NICK
Not what I heard

Finally clicks for her Levels an icy stare at him

ROSIE
You had me followed

NICK
I always cover one of windcom’s stories
Especially when one’s a rookie That’s
why I run things here

ROSIE
You’re also a dirt bag
NICK

ROSIE

Youre jealous

NICK
Curious

Rosie fixes her gaze on him then remembers something

ROSIE
Kiss me

NICK

across her face Very awkward moment

Suddenly -- Kirby steps over to her He takes her hand
Rosie is stunned

A hushed gasp from the onlookers The butler is asking
her to dance

He gently leads her onto the parquet They are the
perfect couple in the most perfect of moments
Gliding around the floor Everyone in the room is caught
up in the scene that plays out before them

Kirby bends his head close to her ear whispers softly

KIRBY
She was the most beautiful woman in the
world -- and she was with him

Rosie is astonished at the passage he’s quoting as he
moves even closer to her

KIRBY (CONTD)
Carefully ever so slowly he took her in
his arms and they began the dance of
love Close Warm
(closer)
Its was as if they had always been in
this embrace
Rosie damned near swoons

Francine catches the look on her daughter’s face and it
registers

Nick hurries back in Lipstick on his mouth He rubs it
off with his sleeve

Walks up to Kirby taps him on the shoulder

to the other man

job

(bellows )
YOU SCREWED MY WOMAN Nobody sleeps with
her but me Even if that’s all I want to
do -- sleep Nobody Now get out

Starting to realize the vast extent of his

A storm about to happen
A very damned

He goes to the door leans out to the secretary

NATE (CONTD)
Call security and make sure this prick
doesn’t steal anything else

Nick storms out Valentina looks at Nate like a lost
puppy -

VALENTINA
Are you firing me too

NATE
He took advantage of your innocence

VALENTINA
(brightening)
He did
(kisses him)
Youre right He did take advantage of
me

She smiles All is forgiven And forgotten As they
walk out we realize they are the perfect couple

Short rich bald fat man with luscious airhead Match
made in heaven

EXT CHAPEL - DAY

Rosie’s wedding Quite a crowd The well-to-do mingle
talk enter the big church

INT BRIDE’S ROOM - DAY

Julia sits on the sofa hanky to her eye Now we see the
reason she’s crying

Rosie stands there arrayed in dazzling white A vision
JULIA
You are so beautiful You make the

perfect bride

Rosie bends down kisses her Genuine love in her eyes
The door opens softly behind Rosie - it’s Nick

JULIA (CONTD)
And Nick’s handsome as sin

ROSIE
That’s the right word

JULIA
Why settle for the lesser evil
NICK
If it’s evil to love someone guilty as

charged
(nuzzles Rosie’s neck)
I love you

ROSIE
It’s bad luck to see the bride before the
wedding

NICK

Couldn’t help it

ROSIE
It’s only twenty minutes

He kisses her Long and hard No mistaking his
intentions Smiles leaves Julia watches him

JULIA
Why can’t I get a guy like him

ROSIE
(fiddles with veil)
Maybe you’re lucky
JULIA
Hello Earth to Rosie You’re getting
married in fifteen minutes Not a good
time to have second thoughts

ROSIE
Better than after

Julia clucks her tongue Leaves Rosie slumps
Mindlessly checks her makeup lipstick when --

HER PURSE

Vibrates She leans over pulls out the I-phone

THE SCREEN

Is full of Tweeter feeds Clicks on them “Should

Inkman marry grlinluv “Duh Of course A myriad of

positive responses ROLLING through as she ‘thumbs’ the

screen

Smiles inspite of herself Stares at it for a moment
KIRBY (0S)
I need to talk to you

She wheels around He’s dressed in his work shirt and
Levis Her demeanor hardens

ROSIE
No you don’t
KIRBY
Yes I do Just a minute That’s all
ROSIE
No
KIRBY
Just one

Before she can respond Kirby is next to her Shutting
the door behind him

KIRBY (CONTD)
One - minute

Rosie checks her wrist watch Hits the button

ROSIE
Go

KIRBY
I didn’t lie to you You asked where Id
“heard” that quote I spoke to you My
grandma read it to me that morning You
didn’t ask me if I “wrote” it

ROSIE
Pretty damned small distinction

KIRBY
I know But when I said it to you it was
like hearing it for the first time

She’s weakening

ROSIE
That whole charade working for my mother
and all that “Nicole In Need” crap What
was that

KIRBY
Me trying to say “I love you”

ROSIE
Why didn’t you just say it
KIRBY
I tried

ROSIE
Not very hard

KIRBY
I love you

Rosie pulls the veil down She’s angry
ROSIE
Damn you How dare you wait ‘til my
wedding day to finally say you love me
She marches to the door Opens it
KIRBY
I hear the Mormon Tabernacle Choir when I

kiss you

She slams the door behind her Nothing Long beat And
then she walks back in

ROSIE
The whole entire choir

KIRBY
All four hundred of ‘em

She can’t move Her eyes well up

ROSIE
I promised him

KIRBY
Even if you don’t love him

ROSIE
That’s a question you don’t have the
right to ask

She’s gone Door closes with a soft sigh Just like
Kirby’s life -- and it’s all in his eyes

TIME CUT TO

KIRBY’S EYES

Which haven’t moved Nor has he Still sitting in the
bridal room Alone In the half darkness
With great effort he stands Heads for the door when it
opens Nate walks in

NATE
So d’ya’ get the novel finished

KIRBY
Not now

NATE
Bad time

KIRBY

Yeah Nate Bad time

NATE
Sorry
(as Kirby leaves)
Monday

Kirby turns back wonder in his eyes

KIRBY
I told you I’m not writing again
Done Sue me I don’t care

NATE
I can’t sue you I love you You’re the
best writer at Cole McKenzie

KIRBY
Doesn’t matter

NATE
Maybe to you

KIRBY
Right To me End of story

NATE
Pretty selfish

KIRBY
What are you talking about

NATE
Love

KIRBY
Huh

NATE

Love Right

Kirby looks at him stupidly then realizes Nate is
talking and looking past him

Kirby turns slowly and Rosie stands there juggling the
bridal bouquet

ROSIE
(very softly)
Right

Poor Kirby is way over his head Doesn’t get it Nate
jerks his head at Rosie

NATE
Rosie and I had a little talk before the
Pastor got here

KIRBY
What did you tell her

NATE
The truth

KIRBY
She already knows I’m Nicole Forrester

NATE
Not you turnip head

Kirby just stares at the man’s bad toupee for a moment
NATE (CONTD)
I said I’d get you a woman to marry
Here she is

Kirby dare not look in case it isn’t true

KIRBY
What about Nick

NATE
He had to go somewhere

KIRBY
Where

ROSIE
Straight to Hell

Kirby does a double take Rosie looks down Light
begins to dawn in Kirby’s eyes

KIRBY
You also said she’d bear my children
NATE
I did

ROSIE
Okay by me

NATE

The Pastor’s still on the clock
Nate smiles Pushes Kirby gently toward her

Kirby and Rosie embrace Hesitantly at first then more
powerfully An embrace of hunger and great longing

Then the kiss -- 82 on the Richter scale

SHOCK CUT

INT CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

The entire congregation is there Minister is waiting as
the “Wedding March” roars out from the pipe organ

Rosie appears More radiant and lovely than we’ve seen
her She walks down the aisle on Nate’s the arm

At the altar she’s met by Kirby still wearing Levi’s and
the work shirt but now with a TIE

Francine smiles As does virtually everyone in the
place

The waning sun weeps through the stained-glass windows
casting an amber magic glow on the proceedings as we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CABIN - DAY

Beautiful Fall colors White caps on the lake A
canoe way the hell out there

EXT CANOE - DAY

Kirby and Rosie sit in the canoe taking in the early
autumn sun Peace

Their hands drift lazily in the water Matching wedding
bands

ROSIE
How can you write as if you’re a woman

KIRBY
Cross dressing helps

ROSIE
(smile)
Besides the obvious

KIRBY
I don’t think men and women are that
different

ROSIE

You don’t When a woman says “honey
are you busy” What does she really
mean

KIRBY
Easy one “Let’s talk”

Rosie raises up Pretty good Thinks

ROSIE
Okay when she says “how do I look in
this dress”

KIRBY
“Have I gained weight”

Rosie cocks her head he’s good at this Starts
conjuring up the hardest one she can think of

ROSIE
Alright any conversation with the words
mother work or “hair”

KIRBY
“Not tonight honey”

Rosie’s face lights up Smiles at him

ROSIE
Very good
(lasciviously)
Ever gotten lucky in a canoe

KIRBY
I got lucky once when I was wearing
Canoe

ROSIE

Just like Hiawatha

She kisses him They get into it Things start getting
serious when the canoe tips over Lots of splashing
sputtering and laughing

INT CABIN BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rosie is already in bed Only thing showing is her head
Covers pulled tightly up around her neck Big smile

Kirby walks in wearing a bath towel around his waist No
light other than moonlight as he slips into the bed with
her

She rolls into his arms

KIRBY
One thing

ROSIE
Can’t it wait

KIRBY
The night you woke up in my apartment
and I let you believe we slept
together
(deep breath)
Didn’t happen

ROSIE
No

KIRBY
No

ROSIE

I know I wasn’t that drunk

KIRBY
Why didn’t you say something

ROSIE
Because I wished it had

He takes her into his arms They begin to fulfill each
other’s desires when --

HALLELUJAH

The Tabernacle Choir is back They react to it at the
same time Stop for a split second

KIRBY
That who I think it is

ROSIE
Who

KIRBY
All those people singing
ROSIE
(slow smile)
Old friends

They fall back into their passionate embrace -- and out
of sight

Then WE HEAR cell phone beeping Incoming tweets AS WE
move over to the opened phone on the bedstand

Love ‘tweets’ Hundreds maybe even thousands as
everything slowly

FADES TO BLACK

End
