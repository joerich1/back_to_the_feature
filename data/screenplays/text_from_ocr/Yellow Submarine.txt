CREDITS
00741 THE BEATLES YELLOW SUBMARINE

In the town where was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life

In the land of submarines

So we sailed on to the sun

Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine

We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine Yellow Submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine Yellow Submarine

Full speed ahead Mr Boatswain
Full speed ahead

Full speed it is sir

Action stations Action stations
Aye sir aye

Captain Captain

As we live a life of ease

Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green

In our Yellow Submarine

We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine Yellow Submarine

THE YELLOW SUBMARINE GETS TO LIVERPOOL
THE BEATLES ELEANOR RIGBY

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby

Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Waits at the window

Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door

Who is it for

All the lonely people

Where do they all come from

All the lonely people

where do they all belong

Father McKenzie

Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near

Look at him working

Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people

where do they all come from

All the lonely people

where do they all belong

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby

Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came

Father McKenzie

Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved

All the lonely people

where do they all come from

All the lonely people

where do they all belong
01314 STREET OF LIVERPOOL

RINGO

Who is me Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night And this is only
Thursday morning Compared with my life Eleanor Rigbys was a gay mad whirl

The submarine sails back

PAUL
Do you ever get the feeling

JOHN
Yeah

PAUL
that things arent as rosy as they appear to be under the surface

RINGO
Whats happening John

JOHN
Well in my humble opinion weve become involved in Einsteins time-space
continuum theory

GEORGE
All right

JOHN
Relatively speaking that is

GEORGE
Of course Maybe times gone on strike

RINGO

GEORGE
Shorter hours

RINGO

JOHN
Its not Its Father Time

GEORGE
How do you know

JOHN
read it in a book

FRED

GEORGE
Whats that mean Old Fred

FRED
It means if we slip back through time at this rate very soon well all disappear up our

JOHN
What are we gonna do then

We could always try a few buttons

RINGO sobs

FRED
Times fast running out for us Im afraid

Uncannily

RINGO
Theres someone in it Look

JOHN
And theyre waving

RINGO
Its a group of fellas

JOHN
Wave back Maybe were both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet

FRED
Going backwards

JOHN

GEORGE
Look at Ringo

Ringo is getting older and so the rest

JOHN
Oh dear were all the same

PAUL
Senile delinquents

GEORGE
And can hear my beard growing

02820 THE BEATLES WHEN I’M SIXTY FOUR

When get older losing my hair

Many years from now

Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine

If Id been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door

Will you still need me

will you still feed me

When Im sixty-four

Youll be older too
And if you say the word
could stay with you

could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone

You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride

As Paul sings time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age
We can read a title “sixty-four years is 33661440 minutes and one minute is a
long time Let us demonstrate”

Doing the garden digging the weeds
Who could ask for more

Will you still need me

will you still feed me

When Im sixty-four
A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64
matching the last one with the end of the song

Every summer we can rent a cottage
in the Isle of Wight if its not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee

Vera Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard drop me a line
Stating point of view

Indicate precisely

what you mean to say

Yours sincerely wasting away

Give me your answer fill in a form
mine forever more

Will you still need me

will you still feed me

When Im sixty-four

JOHN
Well correct me if Im wrong gentlemen but would you agree that we have been
passing through the Sea of Time

RINGO
That would explain a few things Im glad Im not young any more Or was it old

JOHN
What kind of a sea is this

FRED
The Sea of Science

JOHN
Oh yeah

03115 THE BEATLES A NORTHERN SONG

If youre listening to this song

You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not

He just wrote it like that

When youre listening late at night

You may think the band are not quite right
But they are

They just play it like that

It doesnt really matter

What chords play

What words say

Or time of day it is

Cause its only a Northern Song
It doesnt really matter

What clothes wear

Or how fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern Song

If you think the harmony

Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct

Theres nobody there

And told you theres no-one there

03346 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS

As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space When they come back
to the submarine a strange animal enters with them

GEORGE
He looks wrong

PAUL
He doesnt look at all well

GEORGE
In fact hes horrible

JOHN hiding himself
Hes so ugly

ALL
Really ugly

The animal breaks to mourn

FRED
Somebody push a button

Ringo does and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters
03418 SEA OF MONSTERS

JOHN
Theres a Cyclops

PAUL
Cant be Hes got two eyes

JOHN
Then it must be a bi-Cyclops

GEORGE
Theres another one
JOHN
A whole cyclopedia

Among the monsters there is one that swallows everything The Beatles look out the
hatch

JOHN
Theres a school of whales

RINGO
They look a bit old for school

PAUL
University then

RINGO drives the submarine
University of Whales They look like dropouts to me

FRED
Youve got to steer clear

RINGO
Steer clear

FRED

RINGO
Yes dear

Ringo presses a button The submarine shows a big smile The whales smile too

FRED
Now whatever you do dont touch that button

RINGO
Which button

FRED

RINGO
This one

Ringo presses the button and he is ejected from the submarine on the back of a
dinosaur Before he is eaten he is rescued by a kind of horse

FRED
That was the panic button

PAUL
Poor Ringo

JOHN

GEORGE
Never did no harm to no-one

JOHN
Lads now Ringos gone what are we gonna do

FRED

PAUL

Preparing to attack

The submarine expels lot of stranges gadgets including a banner with the words
“The Rolling Sto”

FRED

Bach until the cigar explodes

04806 THE BEATLES LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees

and marmalade skies

Somebody calls you

you answer quite slowly

A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head

Look for the girl with the sun

in her eyes and shes gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people

eat marshmallow pies

Everyone smiles

as you drift past the flowers

That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away

Climb in the back with your head

in the clouds and youre gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters

with looking glass ties

Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds

PAUL

Green

JOHN

Thesis antithesis synthesis causes of causal causation

Yellow submarine “Sea of green sea of green sea of green green green green”
The Beatles arrive to Pepperland just on the base of the temple

05441 PEPPERLAND

JOHN
Pepperland A bit salty around the edges Looks all dingy

GEORGE

PAUL
And quiet

Ringo finds a pile of apples Take one and passes it to Paul

JOHN
Safe at last

PAUL
And none the worse for our adventures

JOHN
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr Ulysses

RINGO
Theres an eye in the apples
Ringo brings down the apples and uncover the Mayor The Yellow submarine comes
down from the sky and lands on the house of music Fred descends sitting down in
an anchor

FRED
There she blows Lord Mayor sir Ive made it Im back

MAYOR

11726 THE BEATLES HEY BULLDOG

Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again

Some kind of happiness

is measured out in miles

What makes you think youre
something special when you smile

Childlike no one understands
Jack knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence

is measured out in years

You dont know what its like

to listen to your fears

You can talk to me

You can talk to me

You can talk to me

If youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude

is measured out in you

You think you know me

but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me

You can talk to me

You can talk to me

if youre lonely you can talk to me
Hey bulldog (x4)

RINGO

With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard
Oh guard Blue Meanio

Jeremy stumbles into a tree An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie Ringo
congratulates Jeremy

RINGO

JEREMY

The Chief treats to stem the rout

CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Get back Get back Once more unto the breach dear Meanies Youre advancing

JEREMY
Ha-ha dont care what you think

CHIEF

JEREMY

Where ground is soft most often grows
Arise arise arouse a rose

Suddenly a rose arise in the Chief nose
A rosy nose

CHIEF
Speak your last piece

JEREMY

Peace peace

Turn off what is sour

Ha-ha bloom ha-ha bloom

CHIEF
Yes let us mix Max Ive never admitted it before but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness

12441 THE BEATLES T’S ALL TOO MUCH

When look into your eyes

Your love is there for me

And the more go inside

the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take

The love thats shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake

So take a piece but not too much

Everybody dance Jeremy and the Chief reconcile The Chief cries of
emotion

Nice to have the time

to take this opportunity

Time for me to look at you

and you to look at me

Its all too much for me to see

The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere its what you make

For us to take its all too much
