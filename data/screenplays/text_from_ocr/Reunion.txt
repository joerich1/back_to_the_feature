be saved

HANNAH

Hannah turns to leave

NEIL
You know you should really think
about accepting Jesus Christ as
your savior

HANNAH
I dont think so

Hannah hovers in the doorway

HANNAH (CONTD)
Do you really want to talk about
this

NEIL
Of course I love to talk about
the Lord

HANNAH
--Because it really interests me
and Ive spent a lot of time
thinking about it

Hannah moves into the patio and sits down across from Neil
HANNAH (CONTD)
You know how youve spent the last

few years reading the bible

NEIL
Yeah

HANNAH
Well Ive spent the last few years

reading Nietzsche and Hemingway
Shaw Zola and Freud--

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

NEIL
--And Steinbeck

HANNAH
And Steinbeck

Neil leans back in the wicker chair It creaks

HANNAH (CONTD)
(continuing)

And they were all atheists

basically trying to answer the same

questions as the bible only

without God

And now Neil leans forward and speaks

NEIL
First off you got to be careful
with that stuff Those guys were
smart but were they smart enough
to come up with all those ideas on
their own

HANNAH
Yeah

NEIL
Im just saying the devil has an
interest in people believing those
guys Sure they came up with the
ideas but with whose help

HANNAH
But its not about God or the
Devil

NEIL

But if you dont believe in the
devil you dont believe in God
either So satan wins

HANNAH
Its not really about God or the
devil or good and evil its

about free will

NEIL
Look I read East of Eden its a
fascinating novel its brilliant
in places but look at Steinbeck
He was married like six times He
was an alcoholic

(MORE)

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

NEIL (CONTD)

He was not a happy man And look

at Hemingway The Snows of

Kilimanjaro is a great little

story but he wasnt happy either

He ended up shooting himself in the

head

HANNAH
And Nietzsche ended up dying of
syphilis that he contracted from a
prostitute

NEIL
Exactly

HANNAH
But they were all moral people
with strict codes of conduct

Tom appears in the doorway

NEIL

Come on in and join us
TOM

No I got to go to bed

Tom remains in the doorway

HANNAH

(starting up again)
Look at the way you view
everything like earlier when we
were talking about getting a real
job I mean youre over here
talking about how no ones ever too
old and about all the strength that
being poor is going to give you
when youre older

NEIL
It is Im telling you

HANNAH
Maybe it is but its like Im over
here making lists of jobs Im too
old to take and- and what Im
going to tell my parents and
trying to make sure I never look
back at the experience with regret
With me its all very thought out
and and concrete

(MORE)

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

HANNAH (CONTD)

And thats the thing youre over
here really vague and thats what
God is Maybe he does exist he
just isnt real and if he does
exist he created me so I couldnt
believe in him

NEIL
You see though youre not sure

HANNAH
No Im not sure and thats ‘cause
Im so concrete No one can ever
be sure and if you are its only
because youre not as concrete as I
am

Neil smiles at Hannah

HANNAH (CONTD)
Youre still really searching and I
think youll find his love Its a
great feeling when you have a
personal relationship with Jesus
Christ I just hope theres time

Hannah shakes her head

HANNAH (CONT’D)
If God does exist and I face him
and he condemns me Ill spit in
his face and Ill go to hell
gladly How can he condemn a
person thats moral

NEIL
‘Cause you rejected his word his
teaching Jesus died for us on the
cross and if you dont accept the
Lord as your saviour man thats
like saying I dont care that
you died for me on the cross I
dont care that you sacrificed your
life for me And Hannah he loves
you and he wants to get to know
you better You just got to want
to know him too

HANNAH
Well then Im going to hell And
I wont be sorry cause I made the
best choice I could

Do you want to accept Jesus Christ
as your saviour Right now

Tom disappears back into the house

Hannah shakes her head

NEIL (CONTD)
Come on If theres no God how
can it hurt

make himself known to you and he
will cause he loves you Take my
hand

Neil reaches out to Hannah and she takes his hand Neil
closes his eyes and Hannah does too and they begin to

pray

thing to do after 12 years of
Catholic schools

NEIL

Lord

EXT BACKYARD - DAY

Neil sits in a lawn chair eating an extra-large hamburger

NEIL
Its the ultimate question facing
man Sin is a demon crouching at

the door It shall be eager for
you and you will be mastered by
it but you must master it

Hannah sits on the ground eating and drinking
HANNAH
But its not about good and evil
Theres no such thing
NEIL
What are you talking about Sin
is a demon crouching at the door
When was the last time you read the
story of Cain and Able
Rose exits the house

HANNAH
I dont know High school

ROSE
Oh no Not Morton again

Rose gets some food and sits down next to Hannah

TOM

JACOB

one

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Jacob grins at Tom Tom shakes his head no
NEIL
(to Hannah)
You should really read the bible
so you could understand what Im
talking about

HANNAH
When was the last time you read
East of Eden High school

Neil doesnt answer

HANNAH (CONTD)
Im just saying thats not why
Morton had us memorize it

JACOB
I just think its open to
interpretation Certainly God is
Good so on the one hand its
definitely about good and evil

HANNAH
Morton didnt care about God He
was an atheist

ROSE
How do you know that

HANNAH
I talked to him about it He took
that quote from Steinbecks East of

Eden

NEIL
And Steinbeck took it from the
bible

HANNAH

Steinbeck found several different
translations of that one verse in
Genesis And he found a
discrepancy in the final part of
the verse you will be mastered by
it but you must master it

TOM
What did it say

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

HANNAH
One translation said thou shalt
rule over him Which is a promise
from God that man shall rule over
evil

NEIL
Differences in translation dont
change the meaning

HANNAH
But there is a difference

ROSE
Let her finish

HANNAH
He found another translation that
said Do thou rule over him And
thats an order from God for man
to rule over evil Neither one
really gives anyone any choice you
see So Steinbeck went back to the
original hebrew and found one

word
TOM
One word
JACOB
What was it
HANNAH
Timshel and it meant thou
mayest And this is very

different its not an order or a
promise its a choice and its
our choice We may but we also
may not Its an offering of free
will and its about individual
responsibility and the invention of
consciousness And thats what
Morton was talking about He was
trying to tell us that we had a
choice and not just between good
and evil but with everything

Tom repeats the word back to himself

TOM
Timshel

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

ROSE
Well I guess we know what his
choice was

JACOB
So youre an atheist

HANNAH
- Yeah

ROSE
No youre not

HANNAH
What Its not a bad word It
doesnt mean Im not moral Some
of the brightest most moral people
in the world are atheists

NEIL

I always wondered what would happen
to guys like you I guess I just
figured youd be washed up after
high school I guess I wanted to
believe it I guess I had to
‘cause I was just so miserable

Neil stops ironing and sits down next to Hannah

HANNAH (CONTD)
Thats the only way I made it
thinking you guys were so immature
or- or not as smart as I was or
or somehow not as deep Like there
was a correlation between being
unpopular in high school and being
successful later in life Like the
two somehow go together

(MORE)

HANNAH (CONT’D)
I had to cling to that cause I was
so unpopular

You werent unpopular

HANNAH
No maybe not unpopular but I was
just such a nothing No one even
knew who I was

NEIL
I remembered you

HANNAH
Yeah and that was the first
surprise But Jacob didnt
remember me And thats the thing
hes pretty much what I thought
you know Hes successful and all
I mean we all knew he would be but-
but he hasnt really changed

NEIL
Jacob is Jacob

HANNAH
Thats why its so good to see you
and see that you actually have some
substance in your life Not that
this means I agree with anything
you believe in cause I dont
but but I do respect the hell
out of you

Neil smiles and hugs Hannah and Hannah inhales deeply

NEIL
Thanks Hannah

But then Neil gets up and goes back to his ironing and a sad
smile crosses Hannahs face

in marriage

TOM

weekend

away And for what

I know if Jacob were to make a
pass at me now I would be able to
turn him down and- and maybe its
the same for you with Elizabeth
