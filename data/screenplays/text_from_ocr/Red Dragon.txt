FADE IN
EXT WESTMINSTER CHURCHYARD BALTIMORE NIGHT

A sculpted face patinaed by time stares at us from a white
marble tomb Across its base the words Edgar Allan Poe
On this drizzly winters night the sad knowing eyes seem
to weep with rain

SUPER TITLE BALTIMORE MD 1983
INT CONCERT HALL NIGHT

On a brilliantly lit stage the Baltimore Philharmonic is
struggling through the 3rd movement of Boccherinis Concerto
in D Major (Allegro piacere) At center a CELLO SOLOIST

The CONDUCTOR frowns Somethings amiss in the wind section
As the SOLOIST nears the end of her passage he jabs his
baton with grim emphasis indicating the winds next entrance

THREE of the FOUR FLAUTISTS instruments already poised by
their lips come in precisely on cue But the

FOURTH FLAUTIST is daydreaming Catching himself with a start
he lifts his flute but now is hopelessly off the beat As

the others finish then lower their instruments he plays on
alone for a few more notes before stopping Then glares around
with defensive belligerence

TWO OBOISTS nearby exchange a glance One rolls his eyes

WE BACK AWAY RISING SLOWLY as if wafting up with the MUSIC
passing over well-dressed CONCERTGOERS elaborate woodwork
gilded cherubs crystal chandeliers till we finally reach
a private box where a TUXEDOED PATRON sits alone his face
in shadows Now he leans forward into the light

HANNIBAL LECTER MD - noted psychiatrist arts patron
connoisseur - is trim very neat with a quality of coiled
stillness His eyes are blue strangely pale CLOSER on him
CLOSER STILL until in a startling flash we are actually

- INSIDE LECTERS MIND -

The stage and its musicians are still there as before but
now with all their colors details and textures enhanced
hyper-detailed The effect is spooky almost hallucinatory
Each note is heard separately and distinctly as if slowed
down slightly echoey At this extremely acute degree of
sensitivity when Lecter ISOLATES ON -

The Fourth Flautist and the hapless man comes in late yet
again his offthe-beat playing is physically excruciating
like a nail scoring glass

Lecters eyelids close ever so briefly in distaste When
they reopen the pale irises are as fixed as a cobras
LECTER (V0)
Think to yourself that every day is
your last the hour to which you do
not look forward will come as a
welcome surprise

INT DINING ROOM LECTERS TOWNHOUSE NIGHT

A candlelit table exquisitely set Around this are seated
the ten very elegant MEMBERS OF THE SYMPHONY BOARD male and
female happily eyeing their hors doeuvres Dr Lecter
circles the table pouring wine for his guests

LECTER
As for me when you want a good
laugh you will find me in a fine
state fat and sleek a true hog of
Epicurus herd

Laughter at this plus some mock-distressed ooohs

LECTER (CONTD)
The poet Horace

RED BOW TIE

Well I must say Hannibal speaking
for the rest of the herd -

(the others laugh)
Im sorry for the Symphony Board -

(more laughter)
- that these little soirees of yours
are always the highlight of our year

OTHER VOICES

TROPHY WIFE

Grave frowns at this polite murmurs of concern

TWEEDY BANKER
Yes poor Raspail Sad thing

RED BOW TIE
Shall I confess something wicked I
cant help feeling just the tiniest
bit - well relieved

(MORE)

RED BOW TIE (CONTD)
That sounds awful I know But lets
face it So does the mans playing

CHALRWOMAN
His familys given millions to the
endowment It wouldve been almost
impossible to fire him

BLUFF CEO
Oh hell turn up somewhere Count
on it

TWEEDY BANKER
Hes probably not missing at all
Just late again

Chuckles laughter one or two happy groans

CHAIRWOMAN
Hannibal confess What is this divine-
looking amuse-bouche

LECTER
If I tell you Im afraid you wont
try it

More chuckles hearty laughter Taking his seat at the head
of the table Lecter snaps loose his napkin Looking around
at his eager expectant guests he smiles

LECTER (CONTD)
Bon appetit
INT LECTERS BASEMENT NIGHT
Lecter now in a cashmere cardigan moves through a walkin
commerciai-style cold storage room Hes carrying something

in an aluminum pan covered with damp cheesecloth SOUND OF
A BUZZER He turns

A small speaker on the wall It BUZZES again

Lecter considers this Then he turns calmly sets his pan

down on a wire storage rack As he leaves he brushes past a
dangling pair of pink naked legs

INTEXT FRONT DOOR NIGHT

The opening door reveals a man in a dark overcoat and scarf
his breath steaming in the cold WILL GRAHAM is pale with
dark watchful eyes Hes exhausted and never got a chance to
shave this morning

LECTER
Special Agent Graham What an
unexpected pleasure
GRAHAM
Sorry to bother you again Doctor I
know its late

LECTER
No bother Were both night owls I
think Come in please

As Graham enters he Passes a brass plaque that reads
“HANNIBAL LECTER MD Psychiatric Consultations

LECTER (0S) (CONTD)
You look tired Will

INT LECTERS STUDY NIGHT

A handsome panelled room decorated with primitive art
fragments of Greek sculpture many books To one Side is a
chaise longue A fire blazes its light flickering over the
two mens faces Lecter is behind his desk m

LECTER
You ought to get more sleep

Graham paces restlessly Under his navy jacket we catch a
glimpse of his shoulder holster and Bulldog 44 Special

GRAHAM
Ill sleep after this bastard is
behind bars

LECTER
Youre part of a three-hundred man
task force No one expects you to
catch the Chesapeake Ripper all by
yourself Have a seat Will

Graham drops into a chair Leans forward urgently Despite
his weariness his face is alive with fierce excitement

GRAHAM
Weve been on the wrong track this
- whole time Doctor You and I Our
whole profile is wrong

LECTER
I dont understand

GRAHAM
Weve been looking at decertified
doctors med school dropouts laid-
off hospital or mortuary workers -
anybody with a crazy grudge and some
kind of anatomical knowledge

LECTER
From the precision of the cuts yes
And his choice of - souvenirs

GRAHAM
But thats where we went wrong Hes
not collecting body parts

LECTER
Then why keep them

GRAHAM
Hes not Hes eating them

Lecter looks at him A pause His voice remains soft

LECTER
Thats most intriguing May I ask
how you came to this conclusion

GRAHAM
We were at Mollys parents’ for New
Years We were ali in the kitchen
Joshs grandfather was carving a
roasted chicken And he said to my
son The tenderest part of a chicken
is the oysters Id never heard the
expression before

LECTER
Soft pads on the back Yes

GRAHAM
I had a sudden flash of the third
victim Darcy Chambers She was
missing those same pads And then it
hit me Liver Kidneys Tongue
Thymus Every single victim lost
some body part used in cooking

On Lecters desk is his letter opener an antique Venetian
stiletto Slender blade diamond in section with a blood
groove He toys with this idly

LECTER
Thats a rather amazing leap Will
Have you shared this with the Bureau

GRAHAM
I needed to see you first But I
know Im right I dont know how I
know I just do Somehow Im
starting to be able to think like
this guy Its like Im climbing
inside his skull

LECTER
And how does that make you feel

GRAHAM
It scares the hell out of me
LECTER

(pause)
Fascinating And quite rare Id
always suspected as much Youre a
compulsive empath Will

(Graham is puzzled)
You see and share intensely the
feelings of others Almost
involuntarily Its a species of
intuition How Id love to get you
on my couch

GRAHAM
One more thing that troubles me
Doctor Im just a cop Youre
the best forensic psychiatrist in
the country And yet somehow in all
our time together this idea never
occurred to you

A quiet moment the two of them staring at each other

LECTER
Im only human Will Perhaps Ive
made a mistake

Graham is silent Lecter’s eyes gleam in the firelight

LECTER (CONTD)
If so it pains me to think I might
no longer enjoy your full confidence

GRAHAM
I didnt say that I dont know what
Im saying Im very tired

LECTER

Of course Look Why dont you come
back in the morning Ill clear
some time on my schedule and well
get started on revising our profile
Sound good

Graham hesitates then nods wearily Lecter smiles
LECTER (CONTD)

You rest here then I11l get your

coat Wont be a tick
Lecter goes out
After a moment Graham rises stretches his back As he waits
he turns glancing idly around Something on a shelf catches
his eye He moves closer
A Dogon tribal MASK features contorted in rage or pain

Graham is a bit disturbed Not his idea of art His gaze
wanders
to

A block of SHINY AMBER with a SCORPION suspended inside A
squat TOLTEC FIGURINE holding up a sacrificial blade A
beaded SIOUX QUIVER with feathered arrows still protruding
And BOOKS so many books Some leather-bound with worn
eracked spines and very old Some much newer

Graham is interested Looks closer at the titles

Recettes Des Provinces De France Die Lubecker Kuche La
Cuisine du Sacrifice en Pays Grec Larousse Gastronomique
This last volume isnt pushed all the way back into place
And it has a red satin bookmark noting a particular page
Graham pulls out the Larousse opens it to the marked page

A recipe titled Fantaisie de Ris de Veau Beside which
someone has written the word Sweetbreads

Graham stares at this
VERY CLOSE ANGLE -— SWEETBREADS” -
Just the single word inked in a fine elegant hand

Grahams eyes widen in a horrified leap of understanding At
almost the same instant he gasps softly Looks down

The Venetian stiletto is buried to its hilt in his abdomen
Its handle is gripped by Lecter’s right hand while the
Doctors left forearm now flashes across Grahams throat
choking off his wind forcing his head back Blood spurts
onto the books Graham drops the Larousse

Lecters face looms over his shoulder as Graham struggles
crying out in this obscene embrace But Lecter is immensely
strong and has him pinned against the bookcase

LECTER (CONTD)
Such a clever boy So curious Perhaps
I took our little game too far
Where were we Ah yes Anatomical
knowledge”

Lecter jerks on the knife and Graham cries out Hes in shock
and getting weaker by the moment

LECTER (CONTD)
Thats your descending colon Ooh
smell that Im going to be days
tidying up in here

Grahams right hand has somehow managed to grasp his 44
But his fingers are slick with blood the gun slides from
his grip falling to the floor

Lecter kicks it aside with one foot then pushes against
him even harder Objects tumble from the shelves SHATTER
Blood is everywhere The Doctor ignores the chaos
LECTER (CONTD)
You understand that a collector of
my particular interests cant afford
the attentions of a cleaning lady
Am I boring you Will You seem to
be getting sleepy Pay attention

He jerks again Graham cries out

LECTER (CONTD)
Thats the mesentery Then the gall
bladder A little higher up is your
spleen Oops Oh well You didnt
much need that anyway

Grahams eyes roll up Hes very close to passing out

LECTER (CONTD)
Remarkable boy I do admire your
courage Will

His lips are close to Grahams ear A loving whisper

LECTER (CONTD)
I think Ill eat your heart

Grahams eyes glaze over He goes limp Lecter grips him in
both arms a few moments longer making sure hes still then
eases his body to the floor where it slumps like a rag
dolls Grahams eyes stare sightlessly unblinking

Lecter kneels beside him He leans over Graham tilts his
chin back raising the stiletto to slash his throat when
suddenly the Doctor himself emits a soft grunt He looks
down surprised

Half a dozen Sioux arrows gripped in Grahams bloody fist
have been punched into his abdomen Grahams eyes re-focus
Staring directly into his His face - sweat-drenched
contorted with pain is very close to Lecters

GRAHAM
(whispers)
Eat that

Lecter rises shocked lurching backwards as he tries to
pluck out the arrowheads But theyre deeply imbedded and
his bloody stiletto interferes with his grip

Graham pulls a second gun a small 38 revolver from an
ankle holster aims unsteadily squeezes the trigger The
BOOM of the explosions in this small room is deafening

NEW ANGLE - SLOW MOTION

as most of the slugs miss smashing into the walls but at

least one catches Lecter in the upper chest spinning him

around hurling him away
“

The Doctor topples over his desk knocking the phone off
before coming to rest on the floor on his side unconscious

Graham holding his spilling guts in with one hand keeps

squeezing the trigger even after his gun is empty Finally
his hand drops weakly the gun CLATTERING on the floor He
stares at

Lecter’s unmoving body Blood pools rapidly around him

Graham through his faintness becomes aware of a strange
new SOUND Dully he turns his head

Lecters phone is lying on the floor its receiver uncradled
humming a DIAL TONE Just a few feet away but it seems like
a mile

Graham grits his teeth then with a supreme effort manages
to topple slowly over in the direction of the phone his
face coming heavily to rest on the floor about a foot from
the receiver Very weakly he reaches out one bloody finger
smearing the 0 button After a pause we hear a VOICE

VOICE
Operator
GRAHAM
(whispers)

Seventeen Chandlers Square
Officer down Help me Please
help me

His eyes roll up in his head He faints

trees turquoise water

SUPER TITLES MARATHON FLTHREE YEARS LATER

A 38 ft Morgan sloop is propped up on blocks MOLLY GRAHAM
in spattered jeans and a painters mask is brushing varnish
on its teak trim She glances up as

A white Ford rental car pulls into the yard stops JACK
CRAWFORD gets out stands looking up at her His gray DC
suit looks hot here out of place

CRAWFORD

She pulls her mask off staring down at him Surprised to
see him then angry And then scared

MOLLY

CRAWFORD
Ineed to talk to him

MOLLY

Weve made a life here Hes getting
better every day He doesnt dream

CRAWFORD
Because its his bad luck to be the
best

She stares back at him her face taut
EXT BEACH DAY

Will Graham and Crawford sit at a picnic table with glasses
of iced tea Beyond them high dunes dense with sea oats
In the distance the Grahams house and boatyard Graham is
darkly tanned thin but fit Hes wary of Crawford

CRAWFORD
How much do you know

GRAHAM
Just what was in the Miami Herald
and the Times Two families killed
in their houses a month apart
- Birmingham and Atlanta The
circumstances were similar

CRAWFORD
Not similar The same

GRAHAM
Whatve you kept out of the papers

CRAWFORD
He smashes mirrors and uses the
pieces Hes blond right-handed and
really strong Wears a size eleven
shoe Also latex gloves so weve
got no prints

GRAHAM
You said that in public

CRAWFORD
Hes not too comfortable with locks
Pried open a patio door in Birmingham
and used a glass cutter in Atlanta
Oh and his bloods AB positive

GRAHAM
Somebody hurt him

CRAWFORD
No We typed him from semen and
Saliva Hes a secretor

A brief silence Crawford reaches into his jacket

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
If you want to just look at -

GRAHAM
No No pictures

He has spoken more sharply than he intended He looks away
down the beach A beat

In the distance JOSH GRAHAM 8 is casting a surf rod
Molly stands watching him hand on her hip with spent waves
around her ankles Finally Graham trusts his voice again

GRAHAM (CONTD)
I dont think Id be all that useful
to you Jack I never think about it
anymore

CRAWFORD
Bullshit You knew what this was
After the second family you had to
know

GRAHAM
Youve got all the people you need
Youve got Dortmund up at Harvard
Bloom at the University of Chicago -

CRAWFORD
Yeah and Ive got you down here
fixing fucking boat motors

Graham is silent Sips his tea

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
Any technician can examine evidence
But youve got that other thing
too Imagination projection
whatever I know you dont like that
part of it

GRAHAM
You wouldnt like it either if you
had it

Crawford dips into his jacket pocket with two fingers Flips
two photographs across the table face down Graham goes
very still Staring at the blank white squares

CRAWFORD
If you cant look anymore God knows
Id understand that
Kanastuem a

5 a aeririae

GRAHAM
You get so you can function anyway
as long as theyre dead The survivors -
theyre the worst Parents Kids
You have to shake it off and keep on
thinking I couldnt do that now

CRAWFORD
(gently)
These are all dead Will

He reaches out turns the photos over face up

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
All dead

Graham looks at him a moment before picking them up

Two snapshots A pretty woman (MRSLEEDS) followed by three
children and a duck carrying picnic items up a pond bank
Another family (the JACOBIS) stands happily behind a cake

Graham stares at the faces a long beat A shadow passes
over his heart He turns his head looking down the beach
again towards

Moliy and Josh as she adjusts the boys backswing His son
nods then strides forward frowning with concentration and
casts again

Crawford knows hes played Graham well But hes careful to
keep any satisfaction from his face and voice

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
Will this freak seems to be in phase
with the moon He killed the Jacobis
in Birmingham on Saturday night
June 28 fuli moon He kilied the
Leeds family in Atlanta night before
last July 26 Thats one day short
of a lunar month So if were lucky
we may have a little over three weeks
before he does it again Hell Im
not the Pope I cant tell you what
to do But Will do you respect my
judgement

GRAHAM
Yes

CRAWFORD
I think we have a better chance to
catch him fast if you help Saddle
up and help us Will Go to Atlanta
and Birmingham and look Just look
Then help me brief the locals

Graham doesnt reply His eyes move back to the photos

INT GRAHAM HOUSE BEDROOM NIGHT

Graham sits on the side of his bed staring out towards the
moon Still almost full Its cold light ladders the waves

MOLLY (0S)
Hes got a lot of other people The
whole damn government

She comes and sits quietly beside him After a moment she
takes his hand

MOLLY (CONTD)
It doesnt have to be you this time

GRAHAM
This kind of psychopath is very rare
He knows Ive had experience

MOLLY
Yes you have

His denim shirt is unbuttoned She sees the looping pink
stiletto scars across his stomach He follows her gaze Then
their eyes meet

GRAHAM
This one will never see me or know
my name Molly The police theyll
have to take him down if they can
find him Not me Crawford just wants
another point of view

For a terrible instant her face crumples Graham hugs her
She hugs him back fiercely

GRBHAM (CONTD)
Molly Ill be at the back of the
pack I promise

MOLLY
(tries to smile)
Never in your life I know you

INT JOSHS BEDROOM DAY

In early morning light Graham stands looking down at his
sweetly sleeping son Reaches gently to smooth his hair

Before leaving the room Graham sets something down on Joshs
bedside table

A wooden box its lid hinged open Resting inside a big
surf lure beautifully handmade by Graham himself A carved
silver baitfish with three treble hooks ‘

EXT GRAHAMS YARD DAY

Graham embraces Molly a last long farewell Then he picks
up his overnight bag trudges across the sandy yard past
the big sloop up on its blocks towards a waiting taxi

Watching him drive away Molly hugs her upper body as if a
cold wind were suddenly rising

EXT SUBURBAN STREET ATLANTA NIGHT

A two-story brick home set back from the street on a wooded
lot The windows are dark One yard light burns

SUPER TITLE LEEDS HOUSE ATLANTA GA
EXT BACK PORCH NIGHT

Grahams flashlight beam shows a long porch with lattice
screening giving privacy to the back door The beam picks’
out deck furniture kids’ bikes a coiled hose It passes
over then returns to a wicker dog bed and plastic bowl

Graham looks at these Then takes a microcassette recorder
from his pocket holds it up to his lips Flicks it on

GRAHAM
Jack - wheres the dog Nobody heard
barking Theres nothing about it in
the case file

He turns aims his flash at the back door Sees an Atlanta
PD seal across it Above this the single glass pane is now
missing replaced by a plywood patch Graham stares at this

GRAHAMS IMAGINATION - KILLERS POV -

A plastic-gloved left hand holds a suction cup in place
while a gloved right hand circles it with a glass-cutter

Quietly removes a neat circle of glass Then the right hand
reaches stealthily down inside through the hole

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Night lights glow on the counters as Graham unlocks the

door comes in The porch lattice behind him is a moonlit
checkerboard He removes his set of keys softly shuts the
door Stands very still taking in the house Sensing madness
like a bloodhound sniffs a shirt

He crosses to the stove turns on its vent hood light cold
neon bathes him Then he sits at the center island where he
puts down a 3-ring binder and house keys The binder has a
Magic Markered title LEEDS followed by a case number

For a long moment Graham is very still Gathering himself
Becoming blank Finally he trusts himself to look around

Gleaming copper bowls Framed samplers Kids art under fridge
magnets Sports schedules Happy snaps of the five dead
FATHER MOTHER TWO SONS and the youngest a DAUGHTER All-
American smiles Mrs Leeds was very beautiful

Theres a SUDDEN LOUD CLICK behind him Graham starts at the
noise Turns quickly eyes darting in fear

On the wall a thermostat has kicked in Air conditioners
begin to HUM somewhere deep in the house

Slowly Graham regains control of his breathing His face is
sweaty Damp moons under his arms He looks reluctantly at
the thick binder Finally he reaches out opens it

Diagrams of the houses layout one map for each floor On
the second floor each childs bedroom shows a red X In
the larger master bedroom two red Xs

INT STAIRCASE NIGHT

Slowly quietly Graham climbs the stairs He glances down
at his right hand as it slides up the railing

GRAHAMS IMAGINATION - KILLERS POV -

The right hand is now plastic-gloved and bigger than
Grahams Its shiny fingers tap playfully along the wood

EXT UPSTAIRS HALL NIGHT

Graham stands in the dark hall outside the master bedroom
The door is ajar He hesitates then very softly pushes it
open wider Steps into the opening Stares into the pitch
black room Raises his flashlight switches it on

GRAHAMS IMAGINATION - KILLERS POV -

In a beam of flashlight MR AND MRS LEEDS sleeping Mr
Leeds turns over disturbed by the glare Still drowsy
blinking uncertainly

Graham in the present hesitates again Very scared A long
beat He has to steel himself to reach in beside the door
turn on the wall switch

Bloodstains shout at him from the walls the mattress the
carpeted floor Splatters over the headboard Taped outlines
of corpses on the soaked quilt The very air has screams
smeared on it

Graham flinches gasping Jerks back into the hall spinning
away from the terrible sight He sags to the floor Fumbles
out his tape recorder gripping it like a lifeline It takes
him two tries to switch it on

GRAHAM
The intruder cuts oh God
(MORE)

GRAHAM (CONTD)
Cuts Charles Leeds throat Then
shoots Valerie Leeds as shes rising
Shes disabled but not not killed
outright Then he goes down the hall
Towards the childrens rooms

Light from the open door shows great dark stains on the hall
carpet More splashes high on the walls

GRAHAM (CONTD)
Arterial spray patterns show that
Leeds followed him trying to fight
He dies with his daughter in her
room Each boy is killed in his own
room one shot each

Graham shines his flash looking more closely at the carpet
Matted slide marks coming from each childs bedroom join
in a wide common trail that leads past where hes sittings
then goes into the master

GRAHAM (CONTD)
He drags the bodies into the master
Keeps them in there awhile before
returning the children to their own
beds The blood evidence becomes
very confused with some of it still
unexplained

He turns looking again reluctantly into the carnage of the
master A curious pattern catches his eye

A row of three bloodstains slanting up and around a corner
of the bedroom wall Three faint stains on the carpet beneath

Graham is puzzled Keys his mike
GRAHAM (CONTD)
Why Why move them They were already
dead And none of them got the
Same extra attention as Mrs Leeds
His eyes squeeze shut his head sags onto his recorder
IN FLASHBACK -

Lecters face grinning obscenely over his shoulder as
Grahams own blood spurts onto the bookshelves

INT MASTER BATHROOM NIGHT

Graham swallows three Bufferin scooping up water in his
hand from the faucet in the sink Splashes more water on his
face some of it spilling on the floor

When he straightens he’s looking at himself in the shattered
mirror of the medicine cabinet Several shards are missing
Traces of red fingerprint powder

He reaches to the sink for his little recorder Gathers
himself again

GRAHAM
Small pieces of mirror were inserted
into the orbital sockets of the
victims These wounds were postmortem
However serotonin and free histamine
levels indicate Valerie Leeds lived
as long as ten minutes after she was
shot During this time he used one
of the bigger shards on her Oh God
Oh Christ I cant do this Jack

He lowers the recorder Stares for a few moments at his own
distorted image Standing right where the killer stood

GRAHAM (CONTD)
(whispers)
I cant take this one Fa

EXT OMNI HOTEL ATLANTA NIGHT

A high-rise hotel downtown Stars twinkle beyond the glass
towers Only a few windows are still lit

INT HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

Graham hunches over a coffee table in his room studying the
case file The binder is open and the photos lab reports
sketches and charts have all been removed spread out

He rubs his eyes exhausted Reaches for a miniature bourbon
Empty He rises starting for the minibar when a thought
freezes him He turns back looks at the table Then he
kneels searching quickly for a particular photo Finds the
one he wants ’ 4

That mysterious row of upright bloodstains on the master
bedroom wall Small medium large

Graham stares at this for a moment Then quickly locates
-from the stack a second photo

The daughters bedroom Her small form facedown on her bed

mercifully obscured Beyond that a bureau Atop the bureau

arow of dolls in various sizes sitting lined up in a neat
row Their glass irises seem to look at Graham

Graham starts to tremble Seeing in his minds eye
GRAHAMS IMAGINATION - KILLERS POV -

The three murdered Leeds children lined up sitting against
the wall in the master bedroom Mirror shards make their

eyes appear to gleam with life

ANGLE SHIFTS QUICKLY as we see MUCH CLOSER on the bed
the same mirrored eyes in Charles Leeds whos propped up

head canted jaw slack Next to him - BELOW US is Valerie
Leeds her dead face on her pillow In her upturned mirrored
eyes just for an instant we catch the reflection of a

shadowy male face

Graham is stunned and exhilarated both at once He grabs
his microcassette recorder

GRAHAM
Jack He wanted an audience For him
and Mrs Leeds The bastard wanted
them all to be watching The pieces
of mirror made their eyes look
alive But why move them again
Why not just leave them that way

He rises pacing on fire His recorder is forgotten

GRAHAM (CONTD)
Theres something you don’t want me
to know about you Something youre
ashamed-of Or is it something you
cant afford for me to know Mrs
Leeds was beautiful wasnt she It
was maddening to have to wear gloves
when you touched her Touch Touch

He stops Turns Stares down at the photos

GRAHAM (CONTD)
Talcum Talcum powder

He drops to his knees scrambling through the reports till
he finds the one he needs

GRAHAM (CONTD)
“Traces of talcum found on her right
inner thigh But none was found
in the house None was found in -

Graham stops Stares into some dark inner distance seeing
GRAHAMS IMAGINATION - KILLERS POV -

The killers left hand still gloved peeling the plastic
glove off his right hand A puff of powder drifts down onto
the pale bare skin of Mrs Leeds‘ leg

Graham is shocked exultant And furious

GRAHAM (CONTD)
You took off your gloves didnt
you DIDNT YOU YOU SON OF A BITCH
You touched her with your bare hands
and then you put the gloves back on
and you wiped her down But while
the gloves were off DID YOU OPEN
THEIR EYES

In a rage he sweeps his arm across the coffee table knocking
the photos and reports in every direction

INT DIFFERENT BEDROOM OMNI HOTEL NIGHT

In a dark bedroom a RINGING PHONE awakens Crawford He turns
on his bedside lamp glances at the red digits of his clock
412 He picks up the phone quickly alert

GRAHAM (V0O)
Jack this is Will Is Jimmy Price
still in Latent Prints

CRAWFORD
Yeah He doesnt get out in the field
much anymore Hes working the single-
print index

INTERCUTTING -

GRAHAM
I think he better come to Atlanta

CRAWFORD
Why You said yourself the guy down
here is good

GRAHAM
He is good but not as good as Price

CRAWFORD
What do you want him to do Where
would he look

GRAHAM
On the corneas of their eyes I

DR PRINCI the chief medical examiner moves in front of
this photo enlargement He holds up a white dental cast which
matches the photo

DR PRINCI
The impressions came from bite marks
on Mrs Leeds as well as a clear
bite mark on a piece of cheese from
the Leedses refrigerator This
reconstruction was done at the
Smithsonian in Washington courtesy
of our friends at the FBI

There are about THIRTY DETECTIVES assembled here sitting at
schoolroom desks Several heads now turn as they look back
curiously or with a hint of territorial hostility at

Crawford sitting at the back His face remains studiedly
neutral Graham beside him is uncomfortable in this very
public emotionally charged setting

DR PRINCI (CONTD)
As you can see he has pegged lateral
incisors - the teeth here and here

Sitting to one side down front are the COMMISSIONER a tough-
looking black man SIMPKINS a pr officer and BUDDY
SPRINGFIELD Chief of Police a burly man in shirtsleeves

DR PRINCI (0S) (CONTD)
This degree of crookedness plus the
groove on this central incisor make
his bite signature unique

EXT LOMBARD FUNERAL HOME DAY

An Atlanta PD patrol car SCREECHES to a halt in front of a
funeral home whose plump dapperly attired owner MR
LOMBARD is waiting anxiously He hurries over to the car
opening its back door

JIMMY PRICE a skinny old man climbs out lugging a heavy
case camera bag and tripod Hes in a foul temper

LOMBARD
Mr Price They called me from the
airport to expect you

(MORE)

LOMBARD (CONTD)
But really sir this is most
irregular Ive got a major funeral
starting in just -

PRICE
This wont take a lot of time I
need one reasonably intelligent
assistant if you have one

He shoves his tripod into the startled Mr Lombards arms
then walks grimly past him into the building

SIMPKINS (V0)
Dr Princi this citys in a panic

INT SQUAD ROOM DAY
Simpkins glances uneasily at the Commissioner beside him

SIMPKINS
The press is going to ask why it
took four days to get that dental
representation youve got there
Would it be fair to say the delay
was caused by the FBI lab and not by
this department

SPRINGFIELD
Simpkins the last thing we need is
to start a pissing contest with the
- FBI Theyve got a lot of expertise
in this area In particular
Investigator Graham does Isnt that
right Jack

CRAWFORD
Yes sir

COMMISSIONER
Can you add anything Mr Graham

Crawford raises his eyebrows at Graham who looks uneasy

COMMISSIONER (CONTD)
Would you come up to the front

Graham stands walks forward reluctantly It seems a long
way As he passes the seated detectives he hears their
whispers - Lecter Guy that caught Lecter Thought he
died Nah but the sumbitch bout gutted him

When he turns to face them the detectives go very still As
if they can read in his eyes a map of the things hes seen

GRAHAM
Mrs Leeds and Mrs Jacobi were the
primary targets

(MORE)

GRAHAM (CONTD)
The others were killed because they
were there I know that might be
hard to accept given what you
saw But this wasnt random It
wasnt some killing frenzy He was
never out of control

The detectives watch him intently The killers enlarged
teeth grin behind Graham like those of a jack-o-lantern

GRAHAM (CONTD)
These attacks are highly organized
The women carefully chosen We
dont know how hes choosing them
or why They lived in different
states and never met But theres
some connection Some common factor
Thats the key Find out what that
is and well save lives Because
this one is going to go on and on
until we either get smart or get
lucky He wont stop

A WOMAN DETECTIVE in the front row speaks up quietly

WOMAN DETECTIVE
Why not

GRAHAM
Hes got a genuine taste for it It
makes him God Would you give that
up

Shes disturbed by his intimacy with the killers feelings

GRAHAM (CONTD)
’ (pause)
Thats all I have

A brief uneasy silence as he heads back to his seat
Springfield replaces him at the front of the room

SPRINGFIELD
Okay Airport and hotel details
will make the rounds again today
Yes again today The rest of you
your assignments are on the sheets

The detectives all start noisily rising grabbing gear

COMMISSIONER (0S)
One last thing

His stern bass voice sinks them back into their seats

COMMISSIONER (CONTD)

I have heard members of this command
referring to the killer as the Tooth

Springfield sits behind his crowded desk Graham slumps in
front of him exhausted from his sleepless night

GRAHAM
Youre doing fine Right by the book
You have a good crew

SPRINGFIELD
They are But this kind of thing is
out of our usual line thank God

Crawford stands off to one side MURMURING into a phone
jotting down his messages Other COPS pass by in the hall
outside Springfield searches through some papers

SPRINGFIELD (CONTD)
You asked about the dog Heres a
sheet on that Last night a vet
here called Leeds brother He has
the dog Leeds and his oldest boy
brought it in the afternoon before
they were killed It had a puncture
wound in its abdomen The vet operated
and it may pull through

GRAHAM
Was the dog wearing a collar with
the Leedss address on it

SPRINGFIELD
No

GRAHAM
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a
dog

SPRINGFIELD

No dog They found a litter box in
the basement with cat droppings in
it Didnt find any cat

Crawford hangs up in time to see Graham consider this His
voice when it comes is soft his mind ranging far away

GRAHAM
If the cat was hurt too the children
might notve found it in time They
may have buried it Ask Birmingham
to check the backyard under the
shrubs behind any outbuildings
Tell them to use a methane probe
its faster

Springfield looks at him a moment impressed before his
‘attention is pulled away by his RINGING phone

SPRINGFIELD

Yeah what

He listens Looks at Crawford

For you

Crawford comes over takes the phone

CRAWFORD
Great work Jimmy Copies to Atlanta

Crawford hangs up Springfield looks at him waiting

CRAWFORD (CONTD)

Springfield turns staring at Graham with amazement but
also something very close to aversion Graham can feel it

SPRINGFIELD
That is by God spooky

After a moment Graham rises abruptly walks out The big
cops troubled stare follows him all the way out the door

EXT SIDEWALK DAY

Graham slips out a side door In the distance on the front
steps REPORTERS PHOTOGRAPHERS and TV CREWS held back by
manned barricades are SHOUTING questions at the Commissioner
and Simpkins the harassed pr officer

Graham turns is striding away from all this fuss when a
SMALL MAN darts out of an alley ahead of him SNAPS his
picture His face pops up from behind his camera

Graham moves swiftly forcing Lounds up against the wall
His face is scary but his voice stays low very intense

GRAHAM
Lounds you write lying shit and The
National Tattler is an asswipe Keep
away from me

A hand grabs Grahams shoulder from behind Its Crawford
He pulls Graham with some effort away from the reporter

CRAWFORD

They move away down the sidewalk walking swiftly Lounds
is undaunted Stands there shouting after them

Though perhaps its gratuitous to
warn you of all people about how
dangerous he can be

Theyre descending into darker danker regions Sweating
stone walls Distant BANGINGS forlorn echoing CRIES

jot down any impressions

Graham doesnt reply Another steel gate CREAKS open and he
goes through Chilton follows irritated

Let me be frank Mr Graham The
first definitive analysis of Lecter
will be a publishers wet dream
Id give you full credit of course

One guard nods to another who pushes a button A final
masSSive steel door WHOOSHES open and Graham after taking
back his manila file walks through into a dark corridor
Chilton can no longer contain himself

CHILTON (CONTD)
Damn it man you caught him You
must have some advice What was your
trick

I let him kill me

The closing door erases Chiltons bewildered reaction

Graham turns looks down the corridor The celis to either
side are dark only atthe far end is one lit

Graham takes a breath gathers himself Then walks quietly
in that direction Shadowy FIGURES low MUTTERINGS in the
barred cells he is passing

Lecters is different higher security A thick barrier of
plastic with a pass-through tray The door is keyless with
a computer touchpad Inside a bolted-down sink toilet
table and bookcase with many softcover books Aliso a cot
on which the Doctor is lying turned to the wall apparently
asleep An issue of Italian Voque lies open beside him

Graham is looking at Lecters back trying to master his
dread when hes startled by the soft abrupt VOICE

LECTER

you wore in court

GRAHAM

He rolls over opens his eyes The pale irises rake Graham

asking you to tell me what they are

LECTER

i computer access Id speak to the
Chief of Staff

LECTER

Ah yes Dr Chilton Gruesome isnt
he Fumbles at your head like a
freshman pulling at a panty girdle
If you recall Will our last
collaboration ended rather messily

GRAHAM

(pause)
Youd get to see the file on this
case And theres another reason

LECTER
Im all ears

GRAHAM
I thought you might be curious to
find out if youre smarter than the
person Im looking for

Lecter turns Comes closer staring into Grahams eyes

LECTER
Then by implication you think youre
smarter than I am since you caught
me

’ GRAHAM
No I know Im not smarter than you

LECTER
Then how did you catch me Will

GRAHAM
Im a compulsive empath Remember
And you had - disadvantages

LECTER
What disadvantages

GRAHAM
Youre insane

Something flickers and dies behind the strange pale eyes

LECTER
Youre very tan Will Your hands
are rough They dont look like a
cops hands anymore That shaving
lotion is something a child would
select It has a ship on the bottle
doesnt it How is young Josh And
the lovely Molly Theyre always

Graham doesnt flinch though Lecters eyes claw his

LECTER (CONTD)
You wont persuade me with appeals
to my intellectual vanity

GRAHAM
I dont think I1l persuade you at
all Youll do it or you wont

LECTER

Graham walks away Lecter raises his voice
ey LECTER (CONTD)

Graham pauses Then returns looks at him

LECTER (CONTD)

SLAMS it in Lecter looks at the folder a moment then runs
a finger lovingly across its cover He smiles brightly

pages his eyes filmed with thought A pause

disfigured Or that he may believe
hes disfigured

Graham in the corridor now sits in a folding chair

GRAHAM

LECTER
4 Yes You notice he smashes all the

mirrors in the houses not just enough
to get the pieces he wants And of
course those shards in their eyes -

so he can see himself there

GRAHAM
Thats interesting

LECTER
Its not “interesting” Youd thought
of that before

GRAHAM
I had considered it What about the
women

LECTER

Dead theyre mere puppets You need
to see them living Will The way
they caught his eye

GRARAM
Thats impossible

LECTER
Almost Not quite What were the
yards like

GRAHAM
Big backyards fenced with some
hedges Why

LECTER
Because my dear Will if this pilgrim

j feels a special relationship with

the moon he might like to go outside

and look at it Have you seen blood

in the moonlight Will It appears

quite black If one were nude say

it would be better to have outdoor

privacy for that sort of thing

GRAHAM
You think the yard might be a factor
when he selects victims

LECTER
Oh yes And there will be more of
them of course Youll be wanting
lots of these little chin-wags

I may not have time

LECTER
I do I have oodles

Graham turns looks at him Tries to steady his voice

GRAHAM
Are you never afraid of anything

LECTER
Yes I fear being bored In that

Graham glances towards the front yard Sees the entrance
sign to the development (STONEBRIDGE) and another big house
with good sightlines this way He turns back puzzled

GRAHAM
Why didnt he break in down there

The workman follows his gaze past some shrubbery to a set of
concrete steps leading down to a basement door well

GRAHAM (CONTD)

WORKMAN

INT JACOBI HOUSE LIVING ROOM DAY

Graham stands at the center of an empty room turning slowly
Bare floors and dead air sliced by morning sunlight No
lingering vibrations of the killer

INT MASTER BEDROOM DAY

Folded dropcloths an eight-foot ladder leftover cans of

paint Nothing for him here either Graham glances into

The master bath Its over-the-sink mirror is new it still
has its manufacturers sticker He looks at himself

EXT BACK YARD DAY

Graham walks along the back fence studying the big yard He
pauses by a garden shed looking at the ground

A small shallow depression The location is marked by a
fresh triangle of yellow crime-scene tape tied to sticks

Graham kneels studying this Touches the earth Looks towards
the house then again at the little grave His expression
changes as a new and disturbing thought comes to him

GRAHAMS IMAGINATION - KILLERS POV -
aa ornare

Froma distance through a scrim of leaves the three Jacobi

children are seen standing in a solemn row looking down at
a shoe box laid in this freshly dug hole The BOY (DONALD)
is dwarfed by his shovel The YOUNGER GIRL (LISA) stoops to
lay a handful of daisies on the box then rises again The
BIG SISTER (MAY) takes both her siblings by their hands
comforting them

Grahams head snaps up from the awful intensity of this
vision Trembling he pulls out his recorder flicks it on

GRAHAM
Jack The pets are like - like
foreplay to him He killed the cat
then waited for the children to find -
it He had to see that if he possibly
could But that meant waiting for
hours Where

He turns slowly Stares Head-high brush runs out from the
fence about thirty yards To where the woods begin

EXT DENSE WOODS DAY

Graham has taken off his blazer His shirt under the leather
shoulder rig is drenched with sweat Hes on his hands and
knees exploring the dense carpet of pine needles and dead
leaves Something to one side catches his eye

A thumb-sized branch neatly severed Brown withered leaves
amid the bright green undergrowth

Graham stares at this

The white-faced end of the branch was clipped not wind-
broken This needed some powerful tool with leverage

Slowly slowly Grahams eyes travel from the clipped-off
branch to the elm tree behind it Then up its trunk

EXT ELM TREE DAY

Climbing already well up in the tree Graham reaches for a
thick limb just above him Pulls himself up by it gasping
then leans around the trunk

Close by his cheek the small stub of the clipped branch
juts out It was removed to improve the view

GRAHAM
(whispers)
I love it Oh sweet Jesus yes You
were here werent you

His eyes travel further up

On the trunk a patch of outer bark has been shaved away
exposing green inner bark Centered in this is a curious

carving it looks like a stake piercing a hollow rectangle

Graham stares at this a long beat Then hauls himself into
a sitting position on the big limb which juts out at a right
angle He turns looks across the open air

A clear view of the back and side of the Jacobi house The
cats grave the flagstoned patio the sliding doors
and then on the second floor the master bedroom window

As Graham looks at this he is seeing in his minds eye

JACOBI hair wet from her shower walks across the room
Passing the window she starts to slip off her bathrobe

Graham staring at the same window in daylight whispers

GRAHAM (CONTD)
Are you ready for me ‘Cause Im
coming

He looks again at the carving Filled with grim exultation

GRAHAM (CONTD)
Im coming for you Climbing right
into your skull Its you and me
now sport

CLOSER on the strange symbol until it FILLS THE SCREEN
EXT GRAVEL ROAD DAY

A weathered sign CREAKS in the wind A jagged crack down its
middle makes it resemble the tree carving Its peeling letters
read DOL--HYDE NUR--ING H-ME Beyond this a gravel

road slithers through a neglected orchard finally climbing

a low rise to a big old country-Gothic house Theres a black
van parked out front

SUPER TITLE STCHARLES MO
EXT DOLARHYDE’S HOUSE VERANDAH DAY

A wooden verandah surrounds the tall once-grand house Down
its crumbling length a row of ancient rocking chairs stir
in the breeze ridden by ghosts MOVING ANGLE past these
approaching the front door as we hear a LITTLE BOYS VOICE
oddly muffled wet-sounding Tearfully scared

LITTLE BOY (V0)
Aayma Aayma Mleedse Aayma

INT FRONT HALL DAY
MOVING ANGLE down the long dark hall passing a LOUDLY

TICKING tallcase clock Ahead of us an archway opening off
to the right Down at the end of the hall a grand staircase
whaactadanea

GRANDMOTHER (V0)

(sleepily)
Whush the Oh Oh You durry boy
Ive never sheen Whurs mah teef

WE COME TO an oil portrait of a stern gray-haired old woman -
GRANDMOTHER DOLARHYDE - wearing a 1940s dress Her features
and hair style make her resemble George Washington on the
dollar bill Her crooked teeth revealed in a grim smile
match the dental mold we saw in Atlanta

The SOUND of dentures sliding from a glass then a MOIST
CLACKETY NOISE as she puts them in

GRANDMOTHER (VO) (CONTD)
Ive never seen a child as dirty and
disgusting as you Look at you Youre
soaking wet

INT BALLROOM DAY

MOVING ANGLE through a former ballroom later converted to
a downstairs ward Rows of dusty-sheeted cots each with its
bedpan still in place Its pitcher and glass on a stand A
big TV set a couch and some armchairs down at one end
along with two or three old-fashioned wooden wheelchairs We
are becoming aware of a new SOUND - a RHYTHMIC THUMPING

GRANDMOTHER (V0O)
Get out get out of my bed Upstairs
Go on now Back up to your room

INT STAIRCASE DAY

MOVING ANGLE up the staircase A frayed Victorian carpet
runner held by brass rods Faded black-and-white photos
in gilt frames society images from grander times

GRANDMOTHER (V0O)
My daughter was a filthy whore and
youre no better

LITTLE BOY (V0)
Aayma Yur hurrnme

GRANDMOTHER (V0)
Shut up Filthy little beast I
shouldve left you in an orphanage
Grandson or not

The RHYTHMIC THUDDING is growing ever LOUDER and now mixes
with other SOUNDS - GASPS and GROANS

INT ATTIC HALLWAY DAY

MOVING ANGLE down a long hall towards the open doorway of
a garret room The room is lit reddish with swirling points
of light as if it were in flames The THUDS’and GASPS are
LOUDER accompanied by a kind of FRENZIED WHIMPERING
nn Aiea test

er

GRANDMOTHER (V0O)
Take off your nightshirt and wipe
yourself off Hurry up

INT GARRET ROOM DAY

MOVING ANGLE past a lonely twin bed and nightstand Then a
shadowy alcove with an old roll-top desk the doorway to a

bathroom Overhead a mirror ball spins firing off
reflections from a red spotlight

GRANDMOTHER (V0Q)
Now Give me my scissors from the
medicine chest

WE COME AT LAST to a gym area - barbells speedbag and a
weight bench where a THICKLY-MUSCLED MAN wearing only gym
shorts is flat on his back pumping iron He GASPS and
WHIMPERS with the strain punishing himself to some new
Standard of perfection He wears a stocking mask rolled
down over his face His sculpted physique is reflected back
from tall standing mirrors

GRANDMOTHER (V0O) (CONTD)
Take that filthy thing in your hand
and stretch it out Do it now Look
down Do you want me to cut it
off 3
(The boy WHIMPERS)
Do you

LITTLE BOY (V0O)
No Aayma No Aayma

GRANDMOTHER (V0)
I pledge you my word Francis if
you ever make your bed dirty again
Ill cut it off Do you understand

LITTLE BOY (VO)
Yehn Aayma Mleeeeedse

Both the LITTLE BOY and the MAN on the bench CRY OUT
simultaneously The man drops his barbell onto the uprights
with a CLANK and lies there trembling drenched with sweat

On his nightstand two squat glasses each holding a set of
dentures One set is the crooked yellow teeth that were once
Grandmothers The second set is “normal Powerful fingers
RECAH INTO FRAME scoop this second set from its glass

INT GARRET BATHROOM DAY

CLOSE ON a shattered mirror over a medicine chest with
many shards missing

GRANDMOTHER (V0)
Look in this mirror I said look

SOUND of SHATTERING GLASS The BOYS VOICE CRIES OUT

After a moment the GROWNUP MAN steps in front of the mirror
He has rolled the stocking mask up to his nose we see only
his lower face weirdly fragmented by the mirrors missing
pieces His cheeks look strangely hollow He has a surgically
repaired cleft palette

GRANDMOTHER (CONTD)
See that ugly mouth Thats the
devils mark Thats why no woman
will ever love you

His big hand covers his mouth for a moment We hear a MOIST
CLACKETY SOUND When it comes away he has inserted his
good normal dentures

GRANDMOTHER (CONTD)
Except for me Francis Only me
Never forget that

The straight white teeth gleam just for an instant in an
awful rictus of a smile

INT GARRET ALCOVE DAY

A semi-human dragon on an art poster looms over a reclining
woman In its niche above the old desk lit by candles

this poster forms the centerpiece of a shrine As we look

at the fiercely-muscled dragon the GRANDMOTHERS VOICE morphs
slowly into a DIFFERENT VOICE - the deeper more spectral
MALE VOICE of the DRAGON Himself

DRAGONS VOICE
NOW GO BACK TO BED AND NO MORE
SNIVELLING

LITTLE BOY (V0O)
sobbing)
Yehn Aayma

Seated below the poster his back to us is the muscular

man Hets now wearing a silk kimono He has close-cropped
blond hair He rolls open the desk top REVEALING an
impressive array of camera equipment a 9 mm Glock with a
homemade silencer a sawed-off shotgun bundled sticks of
dynamite - as well as his huge black ledger already familiar
to us Carefully reverently he opens this

Across the first page in hand-illuminated letters we see
again the words “BeHold A GrEat RED DRAGON Loose between
the pages a yellowed photo of a little boy clinging to his
Grandmothers skirt on the porch of this same house

The man leans over his face in shadows and picks up a new
clipping from a loose pile of newspapers on the floor
Carefully he presses this into place on a blank page

Will Graham in the photo snapped outside the asylum Above
this Freddy Lounds grinning in his by-line portrait and
the screaming Tattler headline INSANE FIEND CONSULTED IN
‘TOOTH FAIRY MURDERS BY SAME COP HE TRIED TO KILL

A red marker pen appears angrily slashes out the words TOOTH
FAIRY then circles Lounds face The offending page is
turned then a few more before the thick fingers pause

Hannibal Lecter tuxedoed and suave from an old pre-arrest
society photo There are many Lecter photos Hes an idol

The mans thick fingers hover over this page for a moment
then touch the Doctors face admiringly

LECTER (V0)
He carved this on a tree

EXT INSANE ASYLUM EXERCISE PEN DAY

Lecter in his prisoners jumpsuit walks along briskly
Hes examining with some interest a photo of the curious
symbol Its startling to see the Doctor in sunlight his
Pale flesh like a floaters

GRAHAM (0S)
With a buck knife Yes The same one
later used on Charles Leeds

Lecter reaches the end of his asphalt pad turns neatly
without looking up - years of practice - and starts back in
the other direction Hes in a long narrow pen like a dog
run its high heavy mesh bristles with electric coils At
one end a closed steel hatch leads back into the asylum

Graham outside this pen has to walk quickly to keep up
with the Doctors pace

GRAHAM (CONTD)
He had a second tool too A bolt-
cutter He used that to clear his
view

LECTER
But

GRAHAM
But I dont think thats what he
brought it for Its too heavy Too
awkward And he had to carry it a
long way

LECTER
Mm And what do we make of this

Still striding he holds up the photo

GRAHAM
I dont like to admit it but were
stumped Any thoughts

LECTER
Do you take me for a child Will
Do you think Im simple

GRAHAM
All right Asian Studies at Langley
identified it as a Chinese character
It appears on a Mah-Jongg piece It
marks the Red Dragon

LECTER
Red Dragon Correct This boy begins
to interest me

GRAHAM
Doctor we dont know what greater
meaning this symbol might have for
him If you could -

LECTER
Like my little cage Will My so-
called lawyer is always nagging
Chilton for better accomodations I
dont know which is the greater fool

GRAHAM
We thought perhaps with your insight

LECTER
A robin redbreast in a cage Puts
all Reaven in a rage Ever been a
redbreast Will Of course you have
I’m only allowed twenty minutes out
here once a week Get to the point

He stops abruptly turning towards Graham

GRAHAM
I think he meant to use the bolt
cutter to enter the house But he
didnt Instead he broke in sloppily
through the patio doors The noise
woke Jacobi and he had to shoot him
on the stairs That wasnt planned
Its not like him

LECTER
We mustnt judge too harshly Will
It was his first time Have you never
felt a sudden rush of panic

Graham is pinned by his gaze The steel mesh between them
suddenly seems very flimsy Lecters voice is rapid harsh
i
i

LECTER (CONTD)
You sensed who I was that I was
committing what you call my crimes

GRAHAM
Yes

LECTER
So you were hurt not by a fault in
your perception or your instincts
but because you failed to act on
them until it was too late

GRAHAM
You could say that

LECTER
But youre wiser now

GRAHAM
Yes

LECTER

Then you wouldnt make that same
mistake again In the unlikely event
let us say that you should ever
encounter this pilgrim

GRAHAM
Probably not I think not

LECTER
Imagine what you would do if you
could go back

GRAHAM
Put two in your head before you
could ever palm that stiletto

LECTER
Ummm Very good Will I believe
were making progress Id like to
see that video of the Leeds family

GRAHAM
No
LECTER
Why not
GRAHAM

It would be obscene

LECTER
You dont make it easy do you
Still one aims to please Ill call
you if I think of anything else
Would you like to give me your home
number

Behind them the DEEP RASP of the steel hatch sliding up
Graham turns his head looks at it Then back at Lecter
aed whose pale eyes have never left his

GRAHAM
End of our session I think Doctor

LECTER
For now
raises the photo)
This was only his first time Already
in Atlanta he did much better Rest
assured my dear Will this one

He holds out the photo When it touches the wires theres a
bright blue flash then it bursts into flames

i LECTER (CONTD)
»--iS no flash in the pan

Graham turns angrily walking away across the courtyard As
Lecter watches him go his head tilts like a curious birds

GUARD (V0)
j Go to the back of the cell Dr
Lecter Face the wall

INT LECTERS CELL DAY

Lecter does as commanded quite meekly while behind him a

i PAIR OF TENSE ORDERLIES open his door and enter the cell

One levels a large-bore air rifle while the other has a can
of Mace and a phone its long cord trailing down the corridor

GUARD
If you turn around before you hear
the lock snap youll get a dart
Understood

LECTER
Oh yes indeed

The second guard sets down the phone then they both back
out quickly eyes fixed always on Lecter and SLAM his door

GUARD
Youve got ten minutes to talk to
your lawyer

LECTER
Thanks so much Youre too kind

BOOKSELLER (VO)
Robes Robespierre Robin

INT BOOKSTORE DAY-

Graham is at an information desk where a pretty young
BOOKSELLER with a flash of green hair is studying a copy of
Bartletts She runs her much-ringed fingers down a page

BOOKSELLER

The Doctor hangs up Smiles thoughtfully
INT BOOKSTORE DAY

Strange ethereal images slip past our eyes — angels and
devils feverish colors - as Graham sits at a table flipping
through a large book of Blakes watercolors Until one
especially startling image makes him stop look closer

The same painting as in Dolarhydes shrine A horned winged
thickly-muscled man-dragon with human legs and a tail Hes
poised in sexual menace above a reclining helpless woman
she is apparently wrapped in flames

Grahams eyes travel down to the caption

The Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun c1803-
057 Courtesy of the Brooklyn Museum of Art”

As Graham stares at this struck by its eerie power the
cute bookseller comes up glances over his shoulder

BOOKSELLER
Weird
GRAHAM
Yeah
BOOKSELLER

Looks like a pretty hot date though

She smiles flirting a bit Graham smiles back

INT CHROMA-LUX INC DAY

A HUM of MACHINERY as WE FOLLOW a cropped blond head broad
shoulders in a white lab coat through a labyrinth of
corridors we catch glimpses of rooms dense with some sort
of hi-tech equipment Other WORKERS passing in the hall
glance briefly at the blond mans face then away out of
respect or perhaps uneasiness

INT INFRARED LAB DAY

A sign beside a door reads INFRARED SENSITIVE MATERIALS IN
USE NO SAFELIGHTS NO SMOKING NO HOT BEVERAGES The red
light is on above this sign

OUR THICK FOREFINGER reaches out pushes a button After a
moment the light turns green and WE OPEN the door ENTER
the light trap then RAP on an inner door

WOMANS VOICE
Come

WE ENTER into cool almost absolute darkness A GURGLE OF
WATER the slight CREAK of a desk CHAIR Then for the first
time we hear the blond mans SHY CAUTIOUS VOICE He doesnt
like to speak to people every word is a bit of a strain

DOLARHYDE
Im Francis Dolarhyde I came for
that package of infrared

WOMANS VOICE
Oh right Put your back against
the door come forward three steps
until you feel the tile under your
feet and therell be a stool just

Dolarhyde moves through the dark SQUEAK of the stool as he
sits The RUSTLE of her LAB APRON Very close to him

Just a second more and well get you

(a timer RINGS)
There we go Okay Lemme just put
this stuff in the Black Hole

A DOOR CLOSES on RUBBER SEALS The HISS of a VACUUM LOCK
Then the slight SQUEAK of her SNEAKERS as she passes him
After a moment the lights come on

REBA McCLANE stands by the door smiling in his approximate
direction She has a handsome prairie face a page boy
freckles Her eyes make small random unseeing movements

DOLARHYDE stares at her surprised We see his face clearly
for the first time even as Reba cannot A white scar line
runs from his upper lip to his nose but his features are
otherwise unremarkable even attractive except for his wary
predatory eyes Hazel almost yellow They flash towards

Her white cane propped in a corner

Then back to the woman herself He can stare at her all he
wants A strange and wonderful freedom

REBA
What do you need the IR for

Dolarhyde tries to avoid S words but when he cant he
says them very carefully

DOLARHYDE
Its for the zoo The World of
Darkness They want to photograph
the nocturnal animals

REBA
Thats great I love animals

She crosses the lab unerringly stops by a refrigerator
opens it without fumbling bends over to reach for something
on the back of a shelf

REBA (CONTD)
I gotta warn you though this stuff
is pretty hot Sensitive up to around
one thousand nanometers And the
more sensitive it is the meaner it
is to handle

She turns around with a small shrink-wrapped package holds
it out in his general direction

REBA (CONTD)
But I guess I dont have to tell you
that

Dolarhyde takes the package Disturbed and aroused to be
alone with her So close almost touching SOUND of the
DOOR behind them They both turn as a co-worker RALPH MANDY
pokes his head in breezily

RALPH
Hi Reba Yo Mr D Whoa Im not
interrupting anything am I

REBA
No Ralph

RALPH
Listen Reeb its startin to spritz
out there How bout I give you a
lift home

REBA
You ride a motorcycle Ralph How

RALPH
(winks at Dolarhyde)
Yeah well I thought maybe wed

sundowner

Spots of color appear in her cheeks

REBA
Ive already got a ride

RALPH
Sure I can‘t change your mind

REBA
I can manage very well thank you

RALPH
Hey thats cool No problemo

Before going he leers at Dolarhyde tilts his head towards
Reba then pumps his forearm lewdly Hot stuff huh boss
The door BANGS shut behind him

Reba crosses angrily starting to collect her handbag
raincoat headscarf and cane

REBA
If theres anything I hate worse
than pity its fake pity Especially
from a walking hard-on like Ralph
Mandy Sorry

Dolarhyde is startled uncertain how to respond

DOLARHYDE
I have no pity

Ltn andi

Reba pauses looks in his direction Smiles gratefully

EXT PARKING LOT NIGHT

POV ANGLE through a rain-streaked window as Reba follows a
concrete divider across the parking lot tapping the edge

with her cane until she reaches a bus stop She stands under
the shelter waiting Rain blows in on her

Dolarhyde a hundred feet away watches her from behind the
closed window of his van His feelings make him uneasy
theyre dangerous to him and Reba both After a moment he
Makes an unprecedented impulsive decision Starts his van

EXT BUS STOP NIGHT

Reba looks up at the SOUND of the VAN as it splashes up beside

her then idles The window WHOOSHES down

DOLARHYDE
Ride with me

REBA
Thanks but I take the bus all the
time

DOLARHYDE
Mandy is a fool Ride with me
(what do men say)
--for my pleasure

She is surprised then pleased by his unexpected chivalry
EXT DOLARHYDES VAN DRIVING NIGHT

Dolarhyde eases up to the curb in front of a duplex in a
quiet neighborhood Glances at her mailbox to be sure hes
got the right address Then gripping his steering wheel
tensely he stares straight ahead through his wipers

Reba beside him measures his quiet as shyness

RE)
Want to come in Ill fix us a drink
He turns looks at her Her pretty face Her unseeing eyes
glowing like mirror shards in the dashboard lights After a

moment his silence makes her smile falter a bit

REBA (CONTD)
Okay then Maybe another time

DOLARHYDE
I will - come in

INT REBAS APARTMENT LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Reba stands her cane in a corner and is suddenly free She
moves about with amazing ease hanging her coat in a closet

dropping her bag on a chair switching on lights Shes
nervous excited not much used to men in here

REBA
How ‘bout a gin and tonic

He watches closely fascinated by her physical assurance

DOLARHYDE
Tonic will be fine

REBA
Youre not a drinker

DOLARHYDE
No

REBA

Ill make us some coffee then And
maybe a piece of pie Karo pecan
its dynamite

DOLARKHYDE

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Reba turns away from her refrigerator with a whole pie sets
it down on her center island where Dolarhyde sits stiffly
upright on a stool Nearby she has started coffee

REBA
When is the zoo project

DOLARHYDE
Maybe next week Theyll call

She goes to a wood block removes a knife testing its
sharpness with her finger She sets it down near Dolarhyde
He looks at the gleaming blade

REBA
I love zoos In fact one of my
earliest memories is seeing a cougar
when I was about five

He stares at her with renewed wariness She misreads his
silence as tact smiles appreciatively

REBA (CONTD)
I didnt lose my sight till I was
seven Piece of barbed wire flew up
from a lawn mower and whacked me

She spans the pie with her fingers bringing her thumbs
together to locate its center then marks this with a tooth
pick She puts the middle finger of her left hand on the
toothpick her thumb on the edge of the tin

REBA (CONTD)
Could you hand me that knife

He picks up the knife feeling its power Looks at her
She smiles Extends her palm Unguarded

He makes himself reverse the blade placing the handle gently
on her outstretched palm

She cuts him a piece of pie guiding the knife with her left
index finger He watches her handle the bright blade Snick
snick She sets his piece out on a plate

REBA (CONTD) -

Anyway Ive always tried to hang on
to what that cougar looked like
Although by now to tell you the
truth what I see in my head is
probably not the least bit like a
cougar

(laughs)
More like a donkey or 4 goat

She finds him a ferk in a drawer sets that by his plate
REBA (CONTD)
Sometimes Im not so sure anymore I

really saw him You know Like
maybe he’s just something I dreamed

up
She stops suddenly self-conscious Looks his way

REBA (CONTD)

You okay
DOLARHYDE
Um-hmmn
REBA
You dont say much do you
DOLARHYDE
Mm-mmm
REBA
(hesitates)

Lets talk about something for a
minute and get it out of the way

REBA
May I touch your face I want to

(wryly now)
I want to know whether to just shut
up or not

She holds her hand ont waiting He stares at her astounded
Then takes her wrist between his thumb and forefinger A
living woman strange feeling

He brings her fingers close to his teeth How easy it would
be to snap them off Snick snick He cant let her touch his
eneip cannot But by a great effort of will he spares
her life

DOLARHYDE
Take my word that Im smiling

He holds her wrist away and releases it Her hand settles to
the counter top fingers trailing like an averted glance A
silence deeply weighted She smiles too brightly

REBA
I think our coffees ready

DOLARHYDE
Im going

She nods sadly He rises heads to the kitchen doorway

REBA
If I offended you I didnt mean to

He turns looking at her Still furiously aroused at war
with himself But his voice is soft

DOLARHYDE
No

He goes out into the living room and she listens for the
CLICK of the LOCK as he pulls her front door closed behind
him She shakes her head wryly - what an idiot I am Then
after a moment puts her fingertips gently on the stool where
he was sitting Still warm She smiles

Becoming I know that you alone can
understand this

Under a powerful Magnifier she reaches inside the plastic
sheath with fine tweezers removing a tiny piece of blond
hair from the paper fiber Carefully with maddening
precision she places this hair in a glassine envelope

Crawford beside her glances at his watch

DOLARHYDE (CONTD)
I have some things Id love to show
you If circumstances permit I hope
we can correspond

Graham hands Katz a copy of the killers dental mold She
holds this up to the impressions on the note They match
exactly She looks at Graham and Crawford excited

INT ASYLUM HOLDING CAGE DAY

The holding cage and the corridor outside it suddenly go
dark Lecter looks up interested

DOLARHYDE (V0)
I have admired you for years and
have a complete collection of your
press notices Actually I think of
them as unfair reviews As unfair as
mine

INT LATENT FINGERPRINTS LAB DAY

Crotchety old Jimmy Price stares unhappily at the porous
toilet paper as a TECHNICIAN scans it with a helium-cadmium
laser As the paper fluoresces glowing smudges appear on
it oily stains perspiration No readable prints

DOLARHYDE (VO)
They do like to sling demeaning
nicknames dont they The Tooth
Fairy What could be more
inappropriate”

The old man frustrated turns to Crawford and Graham shakes
his head Nothing he can do for them

INT ASYLUM CORRIDOR DAY

The BUILDING SUPER in overalls strides down the shadowy
corridor carrying a toolbox and muttering irritably to
himself as instructed i

DOLARHYDE (V0)
It would shame me for you to see
that if I didnt know you had suffered
the same distortions in the press

As the super passes the holding cage keeping well clear of
the bars Lecter’s eyes follow him The mans giving a pretty
good performance not overplaying it

CRAWFORD (V0)
The main thing the first thing is
how Lecter was meant to reply

INT DOCUMENT LAB DAY

A new analyst LLOYD BOWMAN a thin bespectacled black man
Places the two parts of the note with tweezers between
pieces of glass Crawford and Graham hover nearby

BOWMAN
How much longer do we have

CRAWFORD
Ten minutes max

Bowman focuses a small TV camera on the note then darkens
the room till theres only the dull red glow of a lamp and
the blue-green of his monitor screen

BOWMAN
Instructions for answering were
probably in the section Lecter tore
out Why didnt he just throw the
whole thing away

GRAHAM
Its full of compliments He couldnt
bear to part with them

Bowman glances at him intrigued Graham rubs his temples

BOWMAN
Now we can mash just a little

The tattered edges smeared with ink appear MAGNIFIED on
his monitor As he mashes the glass gently these edges
flatten becoming less jagged Hes muttering to himself

BOWMAN (CONTD)
Youre so sly but so am I

Below the words I HOPE WE CAN CORRESPOND we can now
make out through the vermilion ink smears fragments of

writing The tops of letters

BOWMAN (CONTD)
Aniline dyes in colored inks are
transparent to infrared
(pointing)
These could be the tips of Ts here
and here On the end thats a P
or possibly an R

GRAHAM
Jack theres only one safe way of
carrying on a communication thats
one-way blind

CRAWFORD
Publication
(Graham nods)
We know this sweetheart reads the
Tattler The stuff about you and
Lecter was in there I dont know of
any other paper that carried it

GRAHAM
Maybe the Tooth Fairy wants him to
answer through the personal columns

BOWMAN

INT ASYLUM LECTERS CELL DAY

Special Agent Rankin whose face we recognize from the Task
Force Office kneels by Lecters toilet He wears the borrowed
overalls of a maintenance worker but with white cotton
gloves Very carefully hes replacing the two pieces of the
note back onto Lecters toilet roll exactly as they were

DOLARHYDE (V0O)
Forgive the stationery I chose it
because it will dissolve very quickly
if you should have to swallow it

INT ASYLUM CORRIDOR DAY

Rankin slips out of the open cell door slams it peels off
his gloves then quickly grabs a mop from a bucket just as
Lecter appears at the end of the corridor being wheeled
back towards his cell on a hand truck under full restraints

The Doctors masked face glides closer and closer moving
with eerie smoothness as if he can fly

DOLARHYDE (V0
If I hear from you next time I
might send you something wet”

As Lecter passes him Rankin averts his gaze Lecters eyes
rake over him briefly and catch sight of the white cotton
gloves bobbing from his back pocket

CRAWFORD (V0)
The Tattler got an ad order thats
signed 666 Baltimore postmark on

INT TASK FORCE OFFICE DAY

Crawford on a phone swivels towards Graham who is just
returning accompanied by Bowman Nearby a fax machine is
starting to CLATTER Other AGENTS in the background are
discreetly following this drama

CRAWFORD
Its set to run this afternoon
Chicago field office is sending the
text through now

He hangs up and the three of them gather impatiently around
the incoming fax Finally Crawford rips it from the machine
He spreads the flimsy out on a desk They huddle over it

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
(reads)
Dear Pilgrim You honor me

GRAHAM
Thats it Thats it Lecter called
him a pilgrim when he was talking to
me

CRAWFORD
youre very beautiful Christ
I offer 100 prayers for your safety
Find help in John 622 816 91
Luke 17

GRAHAM
Code

BOWMAN
Has to be

CRAWFORD

Weve got -

(looks at his watch
- nineteen minutes to get a message
in if we can break this The Tattler
cant hold its presses any longer

Bowman sits down aligns the fax precisely with the corners
of the blotter He studies it intently as Crawford calls
over Baker one of the other agents

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
Tell Chicago to fax a second copy of
this to the cryptography section at
Langley Then get on the horn with
them and coordinate

As Baker rushes to a phone Crawford looks at Bowman

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
Eighteen minutes

BOWMAN
I understand
(pause)
Its something simple They only
needed cover against casual readers
Im guessing its a book code

CRAWFORD
Book code

BOWMAN
The first numeral 100 prayers
could be the page number The paired
numbers after that could be line and
letter But what book

CRAWFORD
Not the Bible

BOWMAN
No Hes got Galatians 152 here
Galatians has only six chapters
Same with Jonah 68 - Jonah has
four chapters He wasnt using a
Bible

CRAWFORD
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book
to use He specified it his note In
the part Lecter tore out

BOWMAN
It would appear so What about
sweating Lecter In a mental hospital
I would think drugs -

GRAHAM
They tried sodium amytal on him three
years ago trying to find out where
he buried a Princeton student He
gave them a recipe for dip Besides
if we sweat him we lose the
connection

CRAWFORD
If the Tooth Fairy picked the book
then its something he knew Lecter
would have in his cell

BOWMAN

Can we get a list of his books
GRAHAM

From Chilton maybe No wait

Rankin and Willingham when they
tossed his cell took Polaroids so
they could get everything back in
place

Bowman is already stuffing the fax into his briefcase

BOWMAN
Ask them to meet me with pictures of
his bookshelves

CRAWFORD
Where

BOWMAN
The Library of Congress

He hurries out Crawford looks at his watch shakes his head

CRAWFORD
Will were left with three choices
and weve got to decide right now
We can pull Lecters message out of
the paper and run nothing

GRAHAM
That might trigger a timing alarm

CRAWFORD
Yeah Or we can substitute our own
message in plain language inviting
the Tooth Fairy to some mail drop
where weve set up a stakeout Or -

GRAHAM
Or we can let Lecters ad run as it
is
(Crawford nods)
I hate to put in a plain-language
message Jack Lecter would probably
never hear from him again

CRAWFORD
Yeah but I’m leery of letting
Lecters message run without knowing
what it says

They look at one another unhappily A beat
wily Shu races

GRAHAM
I say let this one run Meanwhile
we keep working on the code At least
itll encourage the Tooth Fairy to
contact him again

CRAWFORD
What if it encourages him to do
something besides write

GRAHAM
Well feel sick for a long time But
Jack its our best shot

Crawford finally nods Reaches for his phone

Lounds is near fainting Dolarhyde switches the recorder ON
then looks at him again

EXT DOLARHYDES HOUSE NIGHT
Sunset the sky over the old house is now a purple bruise

well

INT DOLARHYDES HOUSE BALLROOM NIGHT

Close by Lounds the tape recorder is still running He looks
drained but more hopeful He always was a good talker

LOUNDS
Youll let me go now

DOLARHYDE (0S)
Soon Theres one more way I can
help you to better understand

LOUNDS
I want to understand I do And Im
really going to be fair from now on

No response except for an odd NOISE Weve heard it before
The MOIST CLACKETY SOUND of dentures being inserted

LOUNDS (CONTD)
--Hello

The old wheelchair is abruptly spun about and Lounds finds
himself staring into the exposed face of Dolarhyde The brown-
stained crooked smile of the Dragon Who now lunges forward
his fangs parting to rip off Loundss lips

EXT TATTLER BUILDING CHICAGO DAY

The fat security guard is out front again at his sidewalk
post munching a donut Its very early just after dawn no
traffic He hears a STRANGE SQUEAKING NOISE from somewhere
in the distance He looks around sees nothing Looks up the
hilly block

It seems to be coming from up there over the brow of the
hill ECHOING off the nearby buildings Getting LOUDER And
now the SQUEAKING is accompanied by a low whooshing ROAR
and something worse shrill high-pitched SCREAMING

The guards head cocks in puzzlement What the

Ahuman fireball appears rolling down the middle of the
street bouncing on the potholes trailing smoke and sparks
and flames blown back like wings It veers strikes a parked
car overturns in front of the Tattler building one wheel
spinning while flames leap through the spokes enveloping

the blackened figure of Freddy Lounds

LOUNDS VOICE
I have had a great privilege I have
seen I have seen with wonder and
awe the strength of the Great Red
Dragon

INT TASK FORCE OFFICE WASHINGTON DAY

The spools of a cassette tape turn slowly The player rests
on a table next to a padded mailing envelope The envelope
sealed in a clear evidence bag is addressed to Will Graham
co FBI Headquarters Washington

LOUNDS VOICE
He has helped me to understand
His splendor and now now I want
to serve Him

Crawford his face dark sits at the head of the table Around
it Bowman Katz Price Rankin Willingham and Baker

LOUNDS VOICE (CONTD)
He knows you made me lie Will Graham
Because I was forced to lie He will
be more more merciful to me than
to you Will Graham

No one wants to look at Graham He sits a little apart from
the others staring at his hands on the table as if they
belonged to someone else

LOUNDS VOICE (CONTD)
Theres much much for you to dread
Will Graham From my from my own
lips youll learn a little more to
dread

Crawford reaches out punches the stop button

CRAWFORD
That’s enough

GRAHAM
No Let it play

Crawford looks at him Graham stares at the table Crawford
expressionless pushes fast forward then after a moment
punches play again

LOUNDS VOICE
-be fair from now on you know
that
(pause)
Hello

SOUND of the wheelchair CREAKING then horrible part-muffled
SCREAMING After a few seconds Price reaches out turns it
off Even the old man forty years on the job looks shaken

A long awful silence Finally Crawford clears his throat

CRAWFORD
This was my operation and it went to
shit I know that So We can brood
over this Let it tie us up in knots
Or we can learn from it Maybe even
use it to catch the bastard

A glance at Graham still far away The others shift uneasily

BOWMAN

(quietly)

He had to have a van or a panel truck
to move Lounds around in that big

old wheelchair

CRAWFORD
Go on Anybody

a KATZ

4 He had to already have the wheelchair
too Or know where he could get it
fast Its an antique Not the

4 kind of thing youd find around the

house

CRAWFORD
Exactly Does it strike anybody that
he set this up in a hell of a hurry

They look at him He rises crosses to a wall map -

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
The Tattler comes off the press Monday
night By Tuesday morning hes in
Chicago snatching Lounds Either he
lives in the Chicago area or hes
within a driving radius of - call it
six hours

He draws a big circle in red marker with Chicago at its
center Looks at Rankin Willingham and Baker

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
Find out within this area where
ww the Tattler was available for early
distribution Monday night Start
with the airports and all-night
newsstands Maybe some newsie
remembers an odd customer

They nod jotting notes Crawfords energy his ruthless
determination are lifting everyones spirits a bit

CRAWFORD (CONTD)

Lloyd this cassette Enhance the
audio maybe you can pick up something
in the background Beverly Jimmy

The others rise with Bowman taking the evidence bag and
tape player Crawford and Graham are left alone A beat

CRAWFORD (CONTD)
You okay

— GRAHAM
Sure what the hell My cover was on
time

Crawford waits Graham shakes his head Frustrated bitter

GRAHAM (CONTD)
This doesnt fit his pattern Jack
Lounds was a bonus A chance to show
off But the Leedses and the Jacobis
are what he needs The answers wont
be in Chicago But they might be in
Baltimore

CRAWFORD
(surprised)
After what he tried to pull Will
you cant trust one word out of his
fucking mouth

GRAHAM
I think Lecter picked up something
in that missing part of the note
Not a name but something Enough to
narrow the search

CRAWFORD
Even if he did he wont tell you

GRAHAM
Not unless I can deal But I dont
have the chops for that I have to
be able to cut through Chiltons
bullshit

Crawford looks at him unhappily A long beat

LECTER (V0)

Hes sound asleep I assure you
Dr Hassler is about to fix his broken
tooth

DR HASSLER in a lab coat and head mirror turns away from
his patient to smile at Reba

HASSLER
Glad you could come Ms McClane
We appreciate the film by the way

REBA

DOLARHYDE
Im here You go ahead

Gripping the edge of a steel work table with her left hand
she reaches out slowly with her right hand till it encounters
a thick coat of fur She flattens her hand then moves it
gently tentatively at first across an orange- and black-
striped pelt She feels the awesome muscles beneath the
great ribs rising and falling

Rebas face makes quick jerky movements - blindisms - that
she has spent years schooling herself against

sane

Warfield and Hassler see her forget herself and are glad

She moves on circling the table Under hot lights a drugged
Sleeping Bengal tiger lies on his right side Ten feet long
815 pounds Reba looks tiny beside him so vulnerable

BENG Sie a

Her hand trails down the tail then over the furry testicles
Briefly she cups them then moves on

Dolarhyde watching from the shadows is tense with his own
excitement A bead of sweat trickles down his face

Warfield lifts a great paw and puts it in her hands She
feels the roughness of the pads When he presses a toe to
make the claw slide out she gently tests its sharpness

The tigers eyes are open His tongue lolls wetly from his
mouth where we see a broken fang Reba feels his ears the
width of the head and then very carefully touches one of
the incisors Hot breath stirs the sleeve of her blouse She
is flushed elated

Dr Warfield puts his stethoscope in her ears then guides
her fingers downward with the diaphragm

Dolarhyde stares transfixed aroused by the great beast
the womans living proximity to such power

Her hands on the rhythmic chest her shining joyful face
upturned Reba is filled with the tiger heart’s BRIGHT

He looks at her from inside the front door Astounded at
himself that hes let her come here The CLOCK ECHOES a bit

They find you very mysterious and
interesting Come on D its a
compliment

He looks away His reflection stares back at him from the
blank TV screen This disturbs him

DOLARHYDE
Did they tell you how I look

REBA
I didnt ask them But yeah they
told me anyway Want to hear

His face darkens hes dangerously silent She senses it

REBA (CONTD)
They said you have a remarkable
body That youre very sensitive

But I already knew that Oh and
they asked me if youre as strong as

He rises uncertainly starts towards the record player She
drains her bottle then rises too

She steps forward brushing against him He freezes alarmed

REBA (CONTD)
Aha Here you are Want to know what -

She finds his mouth with her fingers and kisses him quickly
lightly before he can stop her Then pulls away as he stares
at her astonished

REBA (CONTD)
Now would you show me where the
bathroom is

INT BATHROOM DAY

As the toilet FLUSHES Reba turns away from the sink locates
a towel Then she pats her hair primping a bit She cant
see that the medicine cabinets mirror has been removed

As she feels her way out of the bathroom her hip passes a
small cupboard On top of this Grandmothers teeth wait in
their squat glass Blackened by freshly dried blood

INT BALLROOM DAY

As Reba navigates back into the room the Beiderbecke is
PLAYING AGAIN Dolarhyde kneels by the TV feeding a tape
into the VCR He rises holding the remote crosses to Reba
lets her take his arm His voice sounds thick almost
frightened

DOLARHYDE
No I want you to be here I do

Hes steering her towards the big chair Instead she releases
his arm goes to the couch sits This unsettles him a bit

REBA

Do you need to hear it too
DOLARHYDE

No
REBA

May I keep the music

DOLARHYDE
Umhmmm

He sits on the other end of the couch Looks at her warily
Then switches ON his VCR remote He MUTES THE TV SOUND as
the Beiderbecke CONTINUES TO PLAY

On the TV a home video KIDS in a big hedged back yard having
a water battle pistols and a hose circling and laughing

TWO BOYS and a YOUNGER GIRL This family (the SHERMANS) is

new to us Behind them a large handsome house A dog runs
about barking silently

CAMERA MOVES SHAKILY to catch MRS SHERMAN as she comes
outside through a porchs screen door carrying soda towards
a picnic table CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON HER a beautiful woman
in cutoff shorts and a skimpy halter top

Reba slides closer to Dolarhyde on the couch Their thighs
brush together He tenses She smiles snuggling closer

REBA
Whats it about

‘In the video the kids are ambushing their Mom squirting

her as she ducks and dodges laughing silently She drops
her sodas grabs the hose from her son turning it on him
Her heavy breasts sway beneath the wet halter

DOLARHYDE

Reba leans her soft weight against Dolarhydes shoulder He
Qiances at her uncertainly then back at the screen

REBA
So then - its what - a corporate
promo Some kind of homework

DOLARHYDE
Homework Yeah

In the video another day DAD on the rec room sofa with a
beer looking a bit drunk Rain outside the transom window

an old trunk Dress-up fun in front of a tall mirror Boas
big shoes a cowboy hat The oldest boy must now be the
cameraman

Reba stretches up to nuzzle Dolarhydes cheek the side of
his neck Whispers into his ear

REBA
Good idea Its so important to
be prepared

Her hand is moving down below She smiles wickedly

REBA (CONTD)
And my goodness are you ever

Hes tense incredibly aroused Sits very still forcing all
his attention on the screen as slowly lingeringly Rebas
lips brush down his chest then his abdomen until her-head
moves OUT OF FRAME

In the video Mrs Sherman in a big garden-party hat
admires herself in the mirror Turns striking a pose for
the CAMERA her hand at the back of her neck Theres a cameo
at her throat Dolarhyde FREEZE-FRAMES this moment

Staring at the TV Dolarhyde trembles Sweat trickles down
his temple His jaw tenses his head arches back

On the arm of the couch his clenched fingertips pop through
the upholstery

scratchy swaggering JAZZ CONTINUES and WE MOVE CLOSER AND
CLOSER on her radiant doomed smile

Dolarhyde wakes up puzzled for an instant because hes not
in his garret bed His eyes widen as he remembers He smiles

ward-room cots Her clothes are strewn across the floor but
shes not in the ballroom His smile fades

Dolarhydes eyes dart in another direction

A SECOND MAN is standing by one of the delivery vans He has
a flashlight Flicking something Hes dusting the outside
mirror for fingerprints

Dolarhyde turns staring

His own black van is some distance away in a darker corner

She turns to run but stumbles choking into the couch Smoke
everywhere She claws her hands through it gasping Backs
away from the couch turning helplessly Which way out Which
way She takes a few tentative steps arms extended then
stumbles over something and falls to her hands and knees

Her fingers trail across the floor till they encounter a
dead hand gripping the shotgun then travel up the arm
the shoulder finally sinking into the horrible mush of
the face pulp bone splinters a loose eye

Gagging choking she falls backwards then scrambles up
again Flames rise behind her CRACKLING shooting up the
drapes then licking across the ceiling Flames and smoke
everywhere She turns desperately Which way Then a new
sound the BONG of the tallcase clock BONG BONG

Her head turns BONG BONG Where is it There That way
BONG BONG Crouching low under the smoke she feels her
way across the ballroom bumping into cots righting herself

bouncing and swaying over the rough ground

INT GRAHAM HOUSE BEDROOM DAY

On the Grahams bedside table their PHONE RINGS Through

the window we see Graham in the distance separating from
Molly and Josh as he starts up into the dunes coming this
way The PHONE RINGS AGAIN and AGAIN with desperate hopeless
urgency

EXT DONES THEN BEACH DAY

Graham reaches the opening of a narrow path through scrub
cedar where he pauses to look back down at Molly and Josh
Hardly able to believe his good fortune When he turns back

Dolarhyde is blocking his path

The crazed yellow eyes stare into his Dolarhyde smiles

His Glock is rising but Graham kicks it strikes the muzzle
as the flash EXPLODES the pistol flies into dense brush

Blood streaks Grahams tee-shirt the bullet has creased his
chest He staggers falls sliding headfirst on his back
down the dunes onto the beach

Molly and Josh turn at the shot are stunned to see

Dolarhyde leaping high into the air trying to land with
both boots on Grahams stomach

But Graham rolls aside making him miss then starts to
rise

Dolarhyde kicks him in the ribs Graham CRIES out tumbling
onto his back again Dolarhyde pins him with his knees then
whips out his buck knife ignoring MOLLYS SCREAMS He raises
the knife high grunting as he slams it down

Graham whips his head to one side as the point misses his
eye but slices open his cheek CRUNCHING deep into the sand

Dolaryhde rocks forward pulling on the handle with both
hands to free the blade Hes leering down at Graham when a
SHRILL WHIRR sounds and Joshs treble-hooked surf lure bites
solidly into Dolarhydes face piercing his cheek deeply
Blood spurts out Dolarhyde ROARS with pain and rage turning
towards

Josh forty feet away pale with fear straining at the other
end of the line Molly leaps to his aid and together they
give the rod a huge yank bending it almost double as

Dolarhyde HOWLS again brutally tugged He rises from Grahams
body stumbling towards Molly and Josh trying to ease the
pressure He grabs at his face trying to pull off the lure
but the third hook snags his hand as well With one hand
gripping the knife one hand hooked to his face he starts
after them lurching over the sand

Graham rolls over gets to his knees then his feet his
lower face a mask of blood Sees Molly and Josh backing away
from Dolarhyde still trying to keep pressure on the line

GRAHAM
RUNNN

They hear him drop the rod then turn run down the beach
their bare feet kicking up sand

Dolarhyde hesitates - half-blinded by blood maddened by
pain - uncertain which target to pick He rips his hand free
from the lure SCREAMING with rage It still dangles from
his face When he turns back looking for Graham

Graham is already scrambling up the dunes onto the path

Dolarhyde sets off after him dragging the rod After a few
yards the reel buries itself in the sand bringing him to a
HOWLING stop again before he thinks to slash the line Then
he takes off loping hard after Graham

As Graham runs panting up the path he can hear the CRASHING
of the brush close behind him Hes got perhaps forty yards
on Dolarhyde Then thirty-five Thirty

EXT GRAHAM HOUSE AND BOATYARD DAY

Graham bursts out of the path at the edge of the boatyard
hesitates for an instant gasping for breath

Too far to the house Hell never make it

Spotting the work ladder propped against the hull of the
Morgan sloop he runs to this scrambles up it to the deck
He turns starts to yank the ladder up after him but

Dolarhyde dives across the sand seizes the dangling end An
unequal tug-of-war develops but Dolarhyde is appallingly
strong and gradually is winning the ladder

Grahams eyes dart across the foredeck desperately searching
for some weapon Bow pulpit windlass plow anchor - viciously
pointed but too heavy to lift

Molly and Josh gasping run into the yard from another
direction closer to the house see the struggle at the boat

MOLLY
Get inside Lock the door Dont
open it for anything

JOSH
Mom -

MOLLY
Lock the door Call 911

ad

Josh with tears in his eyes runs for the house Molly turns
back to the sloop in an agony of helplessness

Graham spots a brush then an open can of spar varnish
Abruptly he releases his grip on the ladder

Dolarhyde not expecting this is momentarily thrown off
balance But now he controls the ladder

Graham snatches up the can hurls the varnish into Dolarhydes
face shoulders upper chest Dolarhyde COUGHS swiping at
the thick choking liquid

Molly has seen this Her mind is racing

Graham throws the can as well but it misses Dolarhydes
head bouncing off his massive shoulder With a ROAR of fury
he starts up the ladder

Graham scrambles up to the boom one hand on the mast then
starts to climb the mast reaching for the cleats

Dolarhyde grabs a stanchion throws his leg over the lifeline
gains the deck

Molly runs to a Zephyr inflatable on a flat-bed trailer
leans over its gunwale rips open the emergency stowage Her
fingers scrabble desperately inside patch kit first aid
kit spare lines then locate a bundle of flares

Graham gets his feet onto the spreader with one hand on the
mast and one hand gripping a shroud Looks up he cant go
any higher Hes trapped Looks down

Dolarhyde is climbing hand over hand towards him The knife
gripped between his teeth the lure still dangling grotesquely
from his cheek His eyes gleaming through a mask of blood

and varnish Confident now Supreme A relentless hellish
spectre

MOLLY (CONTD)
Will

Graham looks down

Molly stands by the keelblocks below Dolarhyde with a double
handful of flares Bending her knees for more leverage she
dips jumps hurling them upwards with all her strength

IN SLOW MOTION the slim red tubes rise twisting turning
end over end a small scattering slowing cloud of them
passing Dolarhyde some arcing back down uselessly until

Graham releases the shroud straining out for a flare with
his free hand - swaying nearly losing his grip on the mast -
his fingertips reaching reaching until he just manages
to snag one pulling it in to his chest

In one motion he twists and pulls the cap as WHITEHOT SPARKS
spit from the tube He looks down at Dolarhyde as just for
an instant

Their eyes lock together And Dolarhyde too late knows
Graham throws the burning flare into his face

Dolarhydes head bursts into flames His neck shoulders
upper chest all blazing his mouth a dark amazed circle at
the center of the corona as his knife tumbles away then
his hands lose their grip then hes falling backwards away
from Graham falling and falling his arms windmilling as
if he might fly as if he were truly a Dragon at last
trailing smoke and fire all the way down to the deck

here hes impaled on the point of the plow anchor
Molly drops to her knees in the sand sobbing in relief

Graham sags weakly his bloody cheek hugging the mast His
eyes squeezing shut in pain

INT LECTERS CELL DAY

Lecter sits at his desk writing a letter His cell has been
restored to its former appearance books and drawings bedding
and toilet seat no trace of his fine meal remains

LECTER (V0O)
Never forget who gave you the best
of them And be grateful Will
Our scars have the power to remind
us that the past was real In fact
its not even really the past Is
ants i

EXT SAILBOAT DAY
Graham stands by the lifeline of a sloop under easy sail

Hes bearded now his hair longer he looks older Hes
reading Lecters letter
wont nc deg tae Jonata

LECTER (V0)
Even after all these years I think
of you often And of course dear
Molly and Josh Do tell them that
one day Im still planning to pay my
respects in person Until then
Your old friend Hannibal Lecter

Graham drops the letter overboard watching for a few moments
as it swirls away in the boats wake Then he turns walking
back along the deck to rejoin Molly and Josh at the wheel

as the sloop sails gracefully away over perfect gin-clear
waters

CHILTON (V0O)
Hannibal Theres someone here to
see you

INT LECTERS CELL DAY

Lecter still composing his letter ignores Dr Chilton who
hovers gloatingly out in the corridor

CHILTON
Wants to ask you a few questions I
told her youd probably refuse

Lecter becomes very still His back remains turned

CHILTON (CONTD)

Yes I thought that might get your
attention A young woman says shes
from the FBI Though shes far too
pretty if you ask me

(a cruel sigh)
What fun it wouldve been to see
you writhing while she was just out
of reach Still we cant get
everything we want Ill tell her
you said no

He starts away

Lecter considers Behind the strange pale eyes something
moves the first quickening of wondrous new possibilities

LECTER
What is her name

THE END
