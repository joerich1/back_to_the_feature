INT KLIMT’S STUDIO VIENNA DAY 1907

During the credits we watch the creation of a masterpiece
GUSTAV KLIMT painting ADELE BLOCH-BAUER his magnetic muse
Klimt has a larger than life sexual presence and there is
something almost erotic about the way he paints his model
which the sensual Adele is more than aware of As his rough
hands apply gold-leaf to the canvas Adele shuffles in her
seat Klimt speaks in German - marked in italics as it is
throughout the script

KLIMT KLIMT (CONT’D)
Move to the left a little Rtick ein wenig nach links
She does so

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Like this So Oder so

He walks up to her touches her just beneath the shoulder
adjusts the angle she is sitting at then returns to his
canvas As he moves away she shuffles again

KLIMT KLIMT (CONT’D)
You are restless today Du bist unruhig heute

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
I worry too much you know Ich mache mir zu viele
that Sorgen das weisst du

KLIMT KLIMT (CONT’D)
About what Wortiber

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
The future Die Zukunft

EXT ELIZABETHSTRASSE VIENNA DAY 1938

The Bloch-Bauer residence on Elizabethstrasse HEINRICH and
KLAUS two soldiers in Nazi uniform stand outside it and
start pounding loudly on the front doors Standing behind
them in civilian clothes is the Gestapo agent FELIX LANDAU

HEINRICH HEINRICH (CONT’ D)

EXT LOS ANGELES STREET DAY

Superimposed caption LOS ANGELES 1999

A car drives down a Los Angeles street and passes by a small
knitwear boutique - this little shop looks very European

small and quaint - quite incongruous in the West Hollywood
surroundings
INT MARIAS BOUTIQUE DAY

The phone is ringing in Maria’s knitwear boutique as MARIA
is handing a purple cardigan over to a customer Maria is an
elderly beautiful woman who oozes old world charm and
elegance Behind her chic ensembles and delicate manner
however there is a fair amount of steel as well as an
anarchic streak Her customer is LIZBET another elderly
woman of European provenance

MARIA
When I saw this one I decided it
had your name on it

Lizbet tries on the cardigan

MARIA (CONTD)
Purple is definitely your colour I
don’t know why it’s taken you sixty
years to discover it

The phone keeps ringing Maria excuses herself with a smile
and answers it

MARIA (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
Hello Yes my dear it is I see
Yes of course Thank you for
letting me know

She puts down the receiver And in her face we see that she
has just received some life-changing news Lizbet notices

LIZBET
Are you alright Maria

And when Maria utters her sister’s name it is to herself

MARIA
Luise

EXT A CEMETERY DAY

A Jewish cemetery on a sunny afternoon an oasis of calm
against the Los Angeles skyline People huddled around
LUISE’S coffin as Maria makes a short speech She looks
dignified in an unostentatious suit

MARTA
My sister and I loved each other
but the truth is that we were
always competing If life is a
race then she has beaten me to the
finishing line But if it isa
boxing match then I’m the last one
standing

A ripple of laughter from those who knew them both With a
spade Maria throws some earth into the grave And when she
speaks again it is quietly looking down at her sister’s
coffin
MARIA (CONTD)

Either way we went through a lot
together and I will miss you Auf
wiedersehen Liebe Schwester

EXT A CEMETERY DAY LATER

As the mourners make their way to the waiting limos in the
late afternoon sun Maria is accompanied by BARBARA
SCHOENBERG an old family friend Barbara is in her sixties
an academic who is intelligent and warm

MARTA
Thank you for coming Barbara to
have you here means a lot

BARBARA
Our families go back a long way
How are you coping

MARIA
I’m getting used to losing the
people I love Practice makes
perfect my dear

And that reminds her of a job that needs doing

MARIA (CONTD)
Barbara Your son the lawyer

BARBARA
Randy

MARTA
Last time I saw him he was wearing
braces and reading a Spiderman
comic How is he

BARBARA
Struggling I’m afraid

Maria looks at her uncomprehending

BARBARA (CONTD)

After law school he worked at a
fancy firm for four years then
decided to set out on his own in
Pasadena

MARIA
So what happened

BARBARA
It all fell apart Add those debts
to seven years of student loans and
things aren’t great

MARIA
I’m sorry to hear it

Theyve reached the cars A chauffeur opens the door for
Maria
BARBARA
Good news is he has an interview
coming up with a firm downtown
Something solid

MARTA
Well that sounds promising

The two women kiss and Maria gets into the car

BARBARA
You need a lawyer

MARTA
Some letters I found in my sister’s
belongings I need advice from
someone I can trust

EXT A LOS ANGELES ROAD DAY

RANDY is driving his tired car a little erratically along an
LA road obviously late RANDY is in his thirties eager
with a rough charm But there is also something a little
chaotic and immature about him as if he is still searching
for his centre

INT CAR DAY

Randy has his hands on the steering wheel and is sipping
coffee from a paper cup as he rehearses for the upcoming
interview

RANDY
And I really feel that with a firm
like yoursand I really feel sir
that with a firm of this
reputation

His cell phone - very much of the period - rings on the
passenger seat next to him He picks it up placing the cup
between his thighs

RANDY (ON THE PHONE) (CONTD)
Hello

BARBARA (0S)
Randy do you remember Maria
Altmann She has something she
wants to ask you

RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
Not a good time Mom not a good
time I’1l call you later

He switches it off puts it back and aims for his cup But
he drops it pouring steaming coffee on his crotch

RANDY (CONT’D)
Shit
EXT BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN OFFICES DAY

Randy is racing towards the impressive glass and steel
building that houses the Bergen Brown Sherman Law Firm He’s
running late has to weave his way through impressive young
lawyers on their way to work

INT ELEVATOR BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN DAY

And in the elevator of the law firm building he is still
rehearsing under his breath

RANDY
I sincerely feel that with a firm
of this standing no with a firm
of this calibre

There’s a high-powered looking lawyer wearing an impressive
suit in the lift - he throws Randy a funny slightly
supercilious look and then spots the coffee stain on the
crotch

RANDY
It’s coffee Soya cappuccino

INT BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN BOARDROOM DAY

In the impressive glass and steel offices Randy is now being
interviewed by the partners that make up BERGEN BROWN and
SHERMAN all in their sixties They sit on one side of the
boardroom table and on the other sits Randy who is
delivering his rehearsed spiel with nervy gusto

RANDY
With a firm as impressive as this
I would be strongly motivated to
deliver my very best

SHERMAN has an open folder before him which contains Randy’s
CV the name SCHOENBERG in bold letters at the top

SHERMAN
Any relation to the famous
composer

Randy is a little put out by the question One senses he gets
this all the time But he does his best to cover the
instinctive response

RANDY
Arnold was my grandfather sir

SHERMAN
His music demands a certain quality
of application but the rewards
validate the effort

BROWN
A radical
RANDY
One of the things I would most look
forward to is dealing with

But he’s interrupted

SHERMAN
And Judge Schoenberg is your
father

RANDY

Retired now but yes sir he is

SHERMAN
Outstanding lineage Mr Schoenberg

RANDY
Yes sir

He gives up smiles just a little defeated It’s not as if
he’s not used to living in these shadows

SHERMAN
So what happened in Pasadena

Randy is flummoxed by the question For a second he
flounders then opts for honesty

RANDY
I took a risk and it didn’t pay
off Working for yourself isn’t
everything it’s hyped up to be

SHERMAN
So now you’re ready to work with
others

And all Randy can muster is a smile But Sherman decides to
give him a chance He closes the file

SHERMAN (CONTD)
Let’s give it a go Mr Schoenberg

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY

In the slightly scruffy back garden of the house Randy shares
with his wife PAM and baby daughter DORA in the San Fernando
Valley Pam and Randy are drinking champagne Pam is holding
the glasses in one hand balancing Dora in the other Randy
puts on a mock patrician voice sending the whole thing up a
little

RANDY
Here’s to Bergen Brown Sherman
and being able to tell them apart

PAM
I’m so proud of you And I was
thinking

RANDY

Uh-oh
She gives him a playful kick in the shins He feigns pain

PAM
We could get out of here put a
down payment on one of those houses
we saw in Brentwood I mean not
now but soon

RANDY
Oh my God I’ve just come from the
interview and she’s already calling
the moving company

It’s the first time we can start
making plans

RANDY
What is it you don’t like about
this place The leaking taps the
rogue mice or the psychotic
neighbour

PAM
All of the above And we could get
somewhere with a little room I
could turn into a studio

RANDY
Sounds pretty good

She kisses him turns to go into the house

PAM
I’m putting her to bed and then
well have dinner Couscous

She turns and behind her back he makes a face - he’s
obviously not a fan of couscous

RANDY
That’s great I’m going to run out
but I’ll be back by eight eight
thirty at the latest

PAM
Where are you going

RANDY
My Mom’s been driving me crazy
Some family friend woman I need to
get it out of the way
She kisses him

PAM
Okay Hurry home
EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS STREET DAY

Randy is driving towards Maria’s house looking a little
stressed as he mutters to himself
RANDY
Thanks Mom

EXT MARIAS FRONT YARD DUSK
In the early evening Randy pulls up in front of Maria’s

little bungalow He gets out of the car to find her watering
her plants

MARIA
I was expecting you at six It’s
ten past

RANDY

My apologies Mrs Altmann it was
gridlock on Wilshire
And it’s lovely to see you too

As he shakes her hand the sarcasm can’t help but seep through
his smile Maria starts to make her way towards the front
door he follows

MARTA
You look tired and stressed but
youre not bad looking

RANDY
Thank you

MARIA
Do you know anything about art
restitution

RANDY
Not a thing

MARIA
Well it’s never too late to learn
Come in and have some strudel I
made it especially for you

And as they enter the house Randy throws a quick glance at
his watch He really doesn’t have the time for this

INT MARIAS LIVING ROOM DUSK

Randy is walking around Maria’s living room taking it all
in It’s as if a small part of pre-war Vienna has been
transported to the suburbs of LA He’s looking at an old
family picture on the wall from the 1920s when Maria
approaches with a slice of strudel for him

MARTA
My sister is the pretty one on the
right
INT LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE DUSK

The photo comes to life it is the 1920’s and the Bloch-
Bauers are posing for the photographer CHILD MARIA and her
sister CHILD LUISE GUSTAV and THERESE their parents
FERDINAND and ADELE their uncle and aunt As each one is
mentioned we see them in close-up as they prepare to have
their photograph taken

MARIA (VO)
I’m the moody one in the middle My
parents my uncle Ferdinand and
my aunt Adele

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Come and sit next to me Komm setz dich neben mich
Maria darling Maria Liebling

MARIA (VO)
Adele did not have children we
were like one big family I had
two sets of parents

GUSTAV GUSTAV (CONTD)
Try to smile Maria it’s Versuche wenigstens einmal im
good to exercise your facial Jahr zu landécheln Maria es ist
muscles at least once a year eine gute Ubung fiir deine
Gesichtsmuskeln

They all laugh and there’s a flash as the photo is taken

MARIA (VO)
The Bloch-Bauers

RANDY (VO)
The famous Bloch-Bauers

INT MARIAS LIVING ROOM DUSK

And now they’re sitting and he’s finished the cake puts the
plate down Maria hands him a big bundle of letters tied
with a string He is polite but it’s not easy he doesn’t
want to be here

MARIA
I found these amongst my sister’s
belongings I’ve translated them
for you on the back

He starts to scan them notices the date

RANDY

MARTA
From our family lawyer in Vienna
Johann Rinesch All about our
paintings which were stolen by the
Nazis

RANDY
Okay

MARTA
A month ago I read in the New York
Times that things are changing in
Austria

RANDY
How are they changing

MARTA
Theyre redrafting the art
restitution laws Reviewing old
cases

INT MARIAS DINING ROOM DUSK

The dining room basks in late afternoon light as Maria opens
the sliding doors to it and it’s madness - all of her
sister’s belongings take up the whole room books and boxes
piled high on the floor and on the table Randy follows her
into the room

MARTA
My sister finally moves in with me
Only problem is she decides to do
it when she’s dead

RANDY
Well at least you won’t be having
any arguments that way

She gives him a look He flounders keeps digging

RANDY (CONTD)
What I mean isyou know how house-
mates argue like about leaving
dishes in the sink and stuff like
that

She gives him nothing Randy digs some more

RANDY (CONT’D)
So you won’t be arguing About
dishes Is what I mean Coz she’s
dead

It’s agony He’s reached the end No more space to dig
RANDY (CONTD)
I’m sorry That wasit was a joke
Well it was supposed to be a joke
She holds it for a beat
MARIA
I’m glad you went for law and not

stand-up comedy

RANDY
Youre not alone there

She reaches for a box opens it takes out a faded old
postcard of the Klimt portrait of Adele hands it to him

MARIA
Here she is - my Aunt Adele
painted by Gustav Klimt

RANDY
That’s quite a painting

MARTA
It’s magnificent She was taken off
the wall of our home by the Nazis
Since then she has been hanging in
the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna

RANDY
And now you want to be reunited
MARIA
Wouldn’t that be lovely
RANDY
It would make you a rich woman I’m
sure
MARIA

And you think that’s what it’s
about do you

Randy is slightly taken aback and admonished With her hand
she indicates the many boxes that lay piled and scattered
across the room a family’s history She picks up an old book
- a copy of the famous children’s stories Struwwelpeter - and
runs her hand across the cover He notices the book

MARIA (CONTD)
I have to do what I can to keep the
memories alive Because people
forget you know And then there’s
justice

And he catches something in her eyes - the memory of a long-
lost past and a long-forgotten wrong

EXT MARIAS GARDEN NIGHT

Under the warm Californian night Maria and Randy are sitting
in her garden Randy is holding the postcard of Adele now
Maria is holding the letters

MARTA
After the war they returned a
couple of paintings to us which
paid for my nephew’s education But
we had to sign export permits to
relinquish any claims to the five
Klimts including that portrait of
my aunt

RANDY
Export permits
And she puts them on the table
again he throws a quick look at his watch

MARTA
The Klimts were deemed national
treasures so we weren’t allowed to
take them out of the country even
though they belonged to us So we
signed them over

RANDY
Just like that

MARTA
We didn’t have the strength to
fight we were just grateful to be
alive All we wanted to do was
mourn our dead And there was
another important reason we didn’t
contest it

RANDY
What was that

MARTA
We were told that Adele had left
the paintings to the Belvedere in
her will

RANDY
Had she

MARIA
We always thought so Then I read
these letters

EXT MARIAS FRONT YARD NIGHT

MARIA
I am sorry to have wasted your
time It was a test and we have
both failed

He looks at her doesn’t know what she means

MARIA (CONTD)
I have bored you to tears Four
times you looked at your watch
tonight

RANDY
I got a new job today I have a
baby that keeps me up at night a
wife I want to make happy several
financial institutions who’d like
my feet broken and a plate of
couscous waiting at home

Randy picks them up but once

A few minutes later Maria is walking Randy back to his car
When they get there she decides to give her verdict
She takes

MARIA
So why would you be interested in
ancient history

the letters from his hand

MARIA (CONTD)
It’s great about the new job And I
hope you succeed in making your
wife happy Enjoy your couscous my
dear

He is about to get into the car then stops

She doesn’

Something

RANDY
Struwwelpeter

t understand

RANDY (CONTD)
That book you were holding My
grandmother used to read those
stories to me Terrifying The one
with the boy who got swept away by
the wind

MARIA
Into a terrible adventure I too
found it frightening

small happens she returns the letters to him

MARIA (CONTD)
Just have a look and tell me if I
have a case That’s all I want from
you

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM NIGHT

Randy and Pam’s bedroom like the rest of their house is
small and too crowded it’s obvious they’ve outgrown it
Randy is lying in bed next to PAM looking through the

letters

PAM
Read that one to me

RANDY
‘llth of April 1948 Dear Luise
Bloch-Bauer’ - that’s her sister -

‘the Austrian Government has
decided to return to you two of the
paintings which were unlawfully
taken from your family during Nazi
occupation’

INT MARIAS BUNGALOW NIGHT

Maria goes from room to room switching off the lights one by
one before she goes to bed As the portrait of Adele is
mentioned we hover a little on the postcard of it which Maria
has placed leaning against some books in the dining room

RANDY (VO)
‘This however comes with the full
understanding that they will hold
on to the Klimt portrait of your
aunt and the other four Klimts
which they insist were bequeathed
to the gallery in her will a fact
which they claim as incontestible’

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM NIGHT

And as Randy reads the last sentence his interest has grown

RANDY
‘The will itself I have not seen
despite my persistent attempts to
do so Yours sincerely Johann
Rinesch’

And he puts down the letter looks over at Pam

PAM
So her lawyer never saw the will

RANDY
Nobody saw the will Can you
believe that Nobody

PAM
Nobody

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ LIVING ROOM NIGHT

In his pyjamas in amongst Dora’s toys Randy is on the
internet researching the web page of the ‘Austrian
Government Ministry of Culture Art Restitution claims’ And
as his eyes scan the page we can tell he’s already being

drawn in a little

INT BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN OFFICES DAY

Randy comes out of his office into the reception area and
sees Maria He’s holding a bunch of papers Maria is sitting
but stands when he approaches Randy’s behaviour is a little
furtive as if he doesn’t want to be seen with Maria

MARTA
Everybody here looks like they are
about to have nervous breakdowns

RANDY
Most of them are We need to
photocopy these

Through a glass partition he notices Sherman looking at him
wondering who Maria is Feeling the pressure Randy starts to
walk down the corridor to where the photocopier is with
Maria in tow He is obviously in a hurry fitting Maria in
between pressing work at the office

RANDY (CONTD)
I was up till three I did some
research for you

MARTA
I’m impressed

RANDY
Get someone on the ground in
Vienna For the first time in fifty
years they’ve opened the archives
So you start by trying to finda
copy of Adele’s will

They have arrived at the photocopier He starts to make
copies for her

MARIA
And then what

RANDY
The Austrian Ministry of Culture
has set up a committee to review
each case individually You need to
fill in an application for them to
consider your claim by the end of
next month at the latest

MARIA
Next month

He hands her a piece of paper - she scans it with her eyes

RANDY
I’ve sent away for one already

MARIA

Slow down you’re going too quickly
for me You can explain things to
me over lunch

And just then he sees Sherman again coming out of a
conference room

RANDY
Oh no no no no I can’t do
lunch I can’t do lunch Maria

INT NORM’S DINER DAY

They’ve had lunch Randy has placed the photocopied papers on
the table amidst the leftovers

RANDY
These are three names of the top
restitution lawyers in America
(MORE)

RANDY (CONTD)
They’1l cost you but without them
it’s a non-starter

MARIA
All I have is my bungalow my shop
and a little money I’ve been saving
for a trip to Hawaii I don’t want
to start throwing cash at some
fancy lawyers

He hands her the photocopies across the table starts to put
on his jacket

RANDY
I need to go

MARIA
Randy I don’t want to rock your
boat

RANDY

Well thank you how considerate

MARIA
But maybe you can help me on the
side Like a hobby

He makes a sign at the waitress for the check

RANDY
You can’t do this ‘on the side’
Maria this is a full time job
this is not a hobby

MARIA
You are quite rude a little
uncouth and completely
disinterested in the past

RANDY
And you have a talent for making me
feel good about myself

MARIA
But you have the connection

RANDY
The connection

MARIA
Your family Randy Your
grandparents They were from
Vienna We have the same history

And to this he has no answer

INT RANDY’S OFFICE DAY

Back on his computer that afternoon Randy closes a work page
and starts looking for info on the actual painting finds a
piece about it and his eyes fall on a sentence about its
estimated value

With him we read the words “estimated value is over a
hundred million dollars” We watch his reaction at this piece
of information

EXT LOS ANGELES PARK DAY

Randy and Pam are having an evening stroll in a local park
Randy has DORA their baby daughter strapped to him As
Randy talks to her about this change of heart he tries to
appear casual nonchalant - a performance to keep her on his
side

RANDY
I can help her find the will get
the ball rolling then hand the
whole thing over to someone else

PAM
You mean you’re going to go all the
way to Austria

RANDY
So all I need to do is get the firm
interested

PAM

You sure that’s a good idea You’ve
only just started the job how do

you think they’1l react if you run
off

RANDY
I’m not going to run off honey I
just want to persuade them to let
me go It’s not a big deal

PAM
Besides you think the Austrians
will make it that easy for you
‘Here’s the files and a pastry’

RANDY
Nothing to lose

PAM
Isn’t there

And her question hovers in the air

INT SHERMAN’S OFFICE DAY

Randy sits in Sherman’s impressive office He’s handed
Sherman a folder which Sherman is scanning his eyes over

SHERMAN
I can’t have you in Austria chasing
paintings Randy

RANDY
Not just any paintings sir

SHERMAN
I know them well Our daughter went
to Vienna and all we got was the
lousy fridge-magnets

RANDY
I see it as a possible investment
for the firm

SHERMAN
Go on

RANDY
It’s all in there sir There seems
to be a move in Austria towards
making reparations for the past
And these paintings are priceless
Id bewe’d be representing Mrs
Altmann

SHERMAN
You really think a painting that
ends up as a fridge-magnet will
ever leave Austria

RANDY
I think it would be a mistake not
to take a look

For a second Sherman could go either way

SHERMAN
One week max I want you back on
the 3rd

RANDY

Thank you sir

INT MARIA’S BOUTIQUE DAY

Early evening and Maria has just received a new shipment of
sweaters at her small boutique She is taking them out of the
containers placing them carefully onto the shelves Randy
bursts in from the street She works throughout the scene

RANDY
Still working

MARIA
I’1l close the shop only when I
croak

RANDY
I’ve got the green light - I’1l go
over try and find the will Then
we take it from there

She is thrilled
MARIA

You are chomping at the bite all
of a sudden

RANDY
The bit yes And I’ve got another
idea

He puts a copy of an Austrian newspaper the Wiener Zeitung
on the counter where she’s folding the sweaters Points to an
article The sight of the Austrian paper unnerves her

RANDY (CONTD)
My mother sent me this There’s an
art restitution conference planned
later this month They’re looking
for speakers I think you should be
one of them

MARIA
What are you talking about

RANDY
Elegant descendant of one of the
great Viennese families- the press
would love you It would speed
things up apply pressure

MARTA

I love your enthusiasm After all
I’m not a spring chicken we need
to get moving But in your haste

there’s been a misunderstanding

RANDY
There has

And suddenly her tone changes a raw nerve has been touched

She stops her work folds up the newspaper and puts it in his
hands

MARTA
I’m not going back to that place
Not now not ever

RANDY
I don’t understand

MARIA
They destroyed my family They
killed my friends and forced me to
abandon the people and places that
I loved

RANDY
Over half a century ago

MARTA
You think that’s a long time

RANDY
Wed only go back for a few days

And now she snaps shows that steel

MARTA
Randy you’re not listening I
would rather die than go back
there Not for all the paintings in
the world

She suddenly feels she may have over-reacted pulls back and
smiles at him But she knows she’s made her point

MARIA (CONTD)
Anyway a few days ago you weren’t
even interested in the case now
you are all over me like a rash
What happened

RANDY
Against my better judgement I
think I like you

And she gives him a shrewd look He can’t quite fool her But
despite his shortcomings she can’t help liking him back

INT MARIAS LIVING ROOM NIGHT

At home Maria is alone in her living room sitting in an arm-—
chair in her dressing-gown surrounded by all her things And
in her face we see that Randy’s suggestion that she should
return has unleashed a tumult of conflicting emotions

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN NIGHT

Randy is feeding Dora who is in a high-chair Pam who is a
part-time photographer has some of her most recent photos
spread out on the kitchen table and is going through them
It’s obvious that she’s not happy about his decision to go

RANDY
I’1l be back before you know it
Four days a week at most Depends
on the reception I get

PAM
So what’s your plan

RANDY
It’s just a hunch no real plan

She stops what she’s doing

PAM
Are you sure about this
We’ve waited so long for this You
me Dora It’s everything we’ve
dreamed of I don’t think we should
jeopardise that

RANDY
I’m not emigrating to the Congo
I’m going to Austria for a few
days with the firm’s blessing
What do you think

She stands up walks over to him gives him a kiss on the
forehead

PAM
OK

And she leaves the room But her words take the wind out of
his sails and plant some doubt in his mind

INT MARIAS LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Still in her nightie and dressing-gown Maria walks up to the
old record-player picks up a record to play The record is
Schubert’s Du Bist Die Ruh sung by her husband Fritz His
name and picture are on the record cover Near the record-
player there is a photo of them both on their wedding day

With the music playing she walks slowly over to the dining
room door opens it For a few seconds she stands in the
doorway looking at all of her sister’s belongings Almost as
if she is frightened of getting closer Then slowly she
moves forwards and starts going through them picking things
up from time to time to examine them objects from their
shared past photographs letters books in German toys A
whole world And as she goes through them a change is
happening in her a realisation Finally she picks up the
old postcard of Adele And then a memory returns --

INT ADELE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 1920S

Adele is sitting in front of her mirror putting the final
touches to her outfit for a night out Out of the corner of
her eye she spots Maria the child who is peeking through a
gap in the door

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)

I see you Maria Come closer Ich sehe dich Maria Komm
her

Maria edges in and comes to stand behind her

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Why don’t you help your aunt Méchtest du deiner Tante
put on her favourite helfen machst du mir die
necklace kette zu

She hangs her diamond and pearl necklace around her neck

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Your little fingers are Deine kleinen Finger sind
perfect for the job gerade richtig dafiir

Maria does as she’s told mesmerised by her charismatic aunt
and her beautiful necklace
ADELE
One day soon you’re going to
have to stop being so timid
Life will demand it of you

When the necklace is fastened
Maria’s face in her hands

ADELE
Your only enemy is fear

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM

ADELE (CONTD)
Bald wirst du aufhdren
miissen so schiichtern zu
sein Das Leben verlangt viel
von uns

NIGHT 1998

The phone rings in Randy and Pam’s bedroom They’re sleeping

Randy wakes picks it up

RANDY
Hello

EXT MARIAS GARDEN NIGHT

Maria is standing under the Los Angeles night in her garden
on the wireless phone to him As she speaks it takes some

courage to form the words

MARIA

I know it’s the middle of the night
but if I wait until the morning I
might change my mind

She stops for a second takes a breath

MARIA (CONTD)
I’ve decided to face the ghosts

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM

NIGHT

Randy puts the phone down Pam has woken is looking at him

questioningly

RANDY
Shes complicated

INT MARIA’S BOUTIQUE DAY

Maria attaches a piece of paper to the shop door which reads

‘THE SHOP WILL BE CLOSED UNTIL TUESDAY THE 4TH OF APRIL’

And

as she does it the doubt has crept in again is she doing

the right thing

EXT LA HIGHWAY INT CAR DAY

Pam is driving Maria and Randy to the airport Maria dressed
to the nines for the trip is in the front seat Randy is in
the back

PAM
Your Mom called again this morning
She wants you to visit the
Holocaust memorial while you’re
over there

RANDY
I know She’s asked me seven times

PAM
She said you should do it in honour
of her grandparents

MARIA
Siegmund and Malvina She had the
most beautiful eyes like an owl

RANDY
I noticed that’s a big suitcase
youre bringing along Maria You
sure you’re taking enough stuff

MARTA
If I’m going back I might as well
do it in style Now Pam darling
would you mind going a little
quicker we’ll miss our flight

RANDY
It doesn’t leave for another four
hours

MARIA

I want to buy perfume and cognac in
the duty free

Pam and Randy exchange a shared look in the rear-view mirror
as he pulls a face of mock terror What is he getting himself
into

EXT AN LA HIGHWAY DAY

MARIA (0OS)
Maybe you should change lanes

PAM
With pleasure Mrs Altmann

And Pam puts her foot down on the pedal and overtakes another
car Maria’s bossiness is effective

EXT VIENNA STREET DAY 1938

An abstract nightmare vision - a Jewish woman in a fur coat
is scrubbing the pavement surrounded by a jeering mocking
crowd of people A moment of absolute degradation And a
voice is heard

STEWARD (0S) STEWARD (CONTD)
We’re about to land in Wir werden gleich in Wien
Vienna Please fasten your landen Bitte schnallen sie
seat-belt sich an

INT AUSTRIAN AIRLINES PLANE ECONOMY CLASS DAY

It was a nightmare - and the voice wakes Maria up with a
sudden start But it’s only the air steward Maria looks out
of the window at Vienna shimmering in the spring sunshine
below them

MARTA
I never thought I’d come back

She puts her hand on Randy’s In that one gesture of physical
intimacy all her fear is obvious And Randy is a little
taken aback by it - he senses the emotional nature of the job
he’s accepted and this makes him a little nervous

EXT VIENNA DAY

Montage of Vienna a world away from Los Angeles the parks
the tree-lined avenues the Schonbrunn Palace

EXT VIENNA TAXI DAY

Randy and Maria in the back of the cab taking them from the
airport to the hotel Maria is staring out of the window

RANDY
Some guy from the Ministry has
agreed to see me tomorrow I have a
feeling he’s in charge of paper-
clips

MARIA
We’re lucky anyone has agreed to
meet us at all

RANDY
But you don’t have to come you can
stay at the hotel

MARIA
We haven’t even arrived and you’re
already thinking of ways to get rid
of me

RANDY
I didn’t really

MARTA
Anyway I want to go to the
Belvedere to visit my aunt The
postcard doesn’t do her justice

Maria stares out of the window They are on the Ringstrasse
now and the car stops at a traffic light by a cafe Maria
looks through the cafe window And suddenly for a second
through Maria’s eyes it changes In the cafe in amongst all
the people in modern dress she sees herself as a child with
her sister Luise and her aunt Adele The girls are eating
ice-cream and Adele is laughing at something one of them has
said

Maria blinks nervously and it all returns to the present A
momentary memory

INT HOTEL RECEPTION DAY

At the reception of their small hotel they are signing in
The receptionist a young Austrian man is writing down the
details from Maria’s passport and notices that she was born
in Vienna

RECEPTIONIST
You were born in Vienna Mrs
Altmann

MARIA

Just round the corner yes

RECEPTIONIST RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
You speak German Sprechen Sie Deutsch

MARIA (CONTD)
Yes But I choose to speak English
these days

RECEPTIONIST
I hope you enjoy your stay

MARTA
I‘1l certainly try

And there is a nervousness in her which manifests itself ina
slight terseness

EXT ELIZABETHSTRASSE DUSK

Later that night Randy and Maria are walking under the street-
lamps of Elizabethstrasse Suddenly she stops in her tracks
Her family home stands before them The emotion is clear in
her eyes and voice Randy notices

RANDY
Are you alright Maria

MARIA
There it is No 18 Our home

RANDY
It’s beautiful

But Maria is overwhelmed and can’t speak

EXT ELIZABETHSTRASSE DUSK

And a few minutes later they are walking round the side of
the house seeing it from different angles and the memories
have flooded back

MARTA
The things this house has seen
Randy Great writers artists and
musicians passed through these
doors including your grandfather
of course And once Doctor Freud
On my wedding night half of Vienna
was here The world was changing
around us but we danced on
unaware Only half conscious

RANDY
Too much alcohol

And the minute it’s out he knows he’s ruined the moment She
gives him a withering look She is incensed

MARTA
Is everything a joke to you

And she walks away He stands in her wake cursing himself

EXT VIENNA HOTEL NIGHT

They are nearly back at the hotel now MARIA walking ahead
angrily with Randy in tow feeling her wrath

MARIA
I think we’ve both made a mistake
coming here

RANDY
I’m sorry Maria

Just as they approach the hotel a man emerges from the
shadows It is HUBERTUS CZERNIN in his mid-forties
handsome intellectual and aristocratic

HUBERTUS
Mrs Altmann

Maria and Randy are taken by surprise
HUBERTUS (CONTD)
I spotted your name on the list of
speakers for the restitution
conference and I tracked you down

Randy is immediately suspicious

RANDY
And you are

HUBERTUS
Hubertus Czernin investigative
reporter I’ve been called a thorn
in the Austrian backside I took it
as a great compliment

He takes Maria’s hand and kisses it Randy balks a little

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
Welcome to Vienna

INT HOTEL BAR NIGHT

In the empty bar of the small hotel Maria and Randy have a
whisky with Hubertus Hubertus places a copy of his magazine
PROFIL on the table in front of them

HUBERTUS
I’m the editor My little Austrian
baby It keeps me sane

Randy flicks through it still suspicious

HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
When I wrote a piece exposing the
Nazi past of our own President
Waldheim a man walked up to me in
the super-market and spat in my
face He called me a traitor I
said to him I was a true Austrian
Only I know how much I love this
country

MARTA
And what makes you interested in a
couple of Californian tourists Mr
Czernin

HUBERTUS
I just thought you could do with an
Austrian friend

Randy hands him back the magazine

RANDY
What for

HUBERTUS
Like many Americans Mr Schoenberg
perhaps you have a tendency to be a
little optimistic

RANDY
I do

HUBERTUS
This whole restitution thing began
as a PR exercise Austria wanted
to improve its image abroad

E)

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
But now it’s turning into a
Pandora’s box

MARIA
They don’t want to give away their
treasures

HUBERTUS

So theyre going to put as many
obstacles in your way as possible
And I might just be able to help
you get over some of them

RANDY
And what’s in it for you What’s
your motive

Hubertus smiles at the abruptness of Randy’s question

HUBERTUS
Let’s just say it’s a very
particular brand of patriotism

He stands

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
Now if you’ll excuse me I think
I’1ll treat us to another round of
drinks

MARIA
Wonderful idea

And he leaves the table and makes his way to the bar Randy
continues to look suspicious and Maria uses the opportunity
to score a point

MARIA (CONTD)
I like him At least he has some
manners

But Randy doesn’t look convinced

INT MARIA’S HOTEL BEDROOM NIGHT

Maria is in her nightie brushing her hair and getting ready
for bed She goes into the bathroom and pours some water over
her face She looks into the mirror questioningly Has she
done the right thing coming back And YOUNG MARIA appears in
the mirror’s reflection her twenty-two year old self in her
bridal dress And we hear the voice of her husband FRITZ as
he sings a Mozart aria

INT LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT 1938

And it’s the night of her wedding to FRITZ - the whole of
Viennese society in their finery Fritz comes to the end of
the aria and there is applause as Gustav takes to the floor
with Therese at his side
GUSTAV

When my daughter Maria told
me that she was marrying an
opera singer I said ‘as long
as he’s not planning to sing
Puccini at the wedding’ So
we settled on Mozart Let’s
keep the whole thing Austrian
I said

Some laughter applause

GUSTAV
I ask you ladies and
gentleman to raise a glass to
Fritz and Maria

WEDDING GUEST
Long live the bride and
groom

GUSTAV (CONTD)
Als mir meine Tocher Maria
sagte sie wiirde einen
Opernsadnger heiraten sagte
ich nur ‘solange er nicht
vorhat Puccini auf der
Hochzeit zu singen Deswegen
einigten wir uns auf Mozart
Ich sagte lass uns das Ganze
auf Osterreichisch machen

GUSTAV (CONTD)
Meine Damen und Herren ich

WEDDING GUEST (CONTD)
Hoch lebe das Brautpaar

And everybody toasts to ‘Fritz and Maria’

GUSTAV
These are troubling days Let
us hope that this memorable
evening is a harbinger of
happier times

GUSTAV (CONTD)
Das sind finstere Zeiten
-Hoffen wir dass dieser
unvergessliche Abend unter
einem guten Omen fiir
gliicklichere Tage steht

Vocal agreement by the audience but you can tell that neither
they or Gustav are convinced by these last words

INT LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT

Maria and Fritz now make their way through the music and the

crowd being congratulated and feted

They pass by Luise who

is dancing the foxtrot brilliantly

YOUNG MARIA
So like my sister to upstage
me even on my wedding day

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Typisch meine Schwester -
Sogar auf meiner Hochzeit
stiehlt sie mir die Schau

And her uncle Ferdinand finds them in the bustle

FERDINAND
Young man you better look
after your treasure here

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Junger Mann passen Sie gut
auf Ihren Schatz auf
FRITZ
I’ll do my best sir

FERDINAND

INT THE ADELE ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT

off one of the corridors one of the rooms is a shrine to
Adele’s memory Nothing in it apart from Adele’s portrait
the other Klimts and vases of flowers A fire-place too with
a fire burning Ferdinand and Maria sit under the portrait

FERDINAND
It makes me sad your aunt
Adele is not here to admire
you today

YOUNG MARIA
Me too uncle

FERDINAND
At least she’s not alive to
witness what is happening to
the country she loved so
much

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Es macht mich traurig dass
deine Tante Adele nicht hier
ist um dich heute zu
bewundern

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Mich auch Onkel

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Wenigstens muss sie nicht
erleben was mit ihrem
heissgeliebten Land
geschieht

He takes out a small jewelry case

FERDINAND
I want you to have this
Maria

He opens the case

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Ich moechte dass du sie
bekommst Maria

it is Adele’s diamond necklace - the same

one she wears in the painting the same one Maria fastened

around her neck as a child

YOUNG MARIA
Her favourite

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Ihre Lieblingskette

Ferdinand stands up and fastens it around her neck Maria is

deeply moved by the gesture

FERDINAND
Like her you are head-strong
and inquiring Something of
Adele’s spirit is in you

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Wie sie bist du eigensinnig
und neugierig Du hast etwas
von Adeles Charakter in dir
YOUNG MARIA
I will always treasure it

Gustav enters with Luise

YOUNG LUISE
There you are Come Maria
it’s time for the cake

GUSTAV
The whole world has been
looking for you

YOUNG MARIA
Alright alright

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Ich werde sie immer zu
schaétzen wissen

YOUNG LUISE (CONTD)
Da bist du ja Komm’ Maria
es ist Zeit fiir den Torte

GUSTAV (CONTD)
Die ganze Welt ist auf der
Suche nach Dir

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Schon gut ich komme

Maria walks up to her uncle and embraces him He kisses her

Luise grabs her by the hand

YOUNG LUISE
Hurry up I’m hungry

YOUNG LUISE (CONTD)
Mach schnell Ich bin
hungrig

And she drags Maria out of the room

FERDINAND
That Maria of yours is a
heart-stealer

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Deine Maria ist
unwiderstehlich

He walks up to a small drinks tray and pours himself a whisky
and one for his brother He hands it to him

FERDINAND
The Chancellor has conceded
on every front Hitler has
made some empty promise about
Austrian sovereignty but my
bet is that before the end of
the month the Nazis will be
marching round the
Ringstrasse in their
jackboots

GUSTAV
You really think that is
possible The Austrians will
not allow it

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Der Kanzler hat alles
bewilligt Hitler hat einige
leere Versprechen tiber
Osterreichs Souveranitat
gemacht aber ich wette dass
die Nazis noch vor Monatsende
in ihren Stiefeln um die
Ringstrasse marschieren
werden

GUSTAV (CONTD)
Glaubst du wirklich dass
das méglich ist Die
Osterreicher werden es nicht
zulassen
FERDINAND
I will leave for Zurich on
Sunday with Luise By next
week the rest of you must
join us

GUSTAV
We can’t leave just like
that There will be much to
do we have to take our time

FERDINAND
Like always you are a
dreamer Gustav Time is the
one thing we haven’t got

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Ich reise am Sonntag mit
Luise nach Ziirich Bis
ndchste Woche miisst ihr alle
dort eingetroffen sein

GUSTAV (CONTD)
Wir kénnen nicht einfach so
weggehen Es gibt viel zu
tun wir brauchen Zeit

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Du bist wie immer ein
Traéumer Gustav Zeit ist das
Einzige was wir nicht haben

And Gustav cannot ignore these final words They strike a
chord with him and for the first time there is a very

palpable worry in his eyes

INT LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT

After the cutting of the cake Maria and Fritz are surrounded
by family and friends Therese is making the most of the
moment as the mother of the bride making a little speech

THERESE
Now it is time for the mother
to speak And all I can do is
wish these children a life of
peace and love

THERESE (CONTD)
Jetzt ist es an der Zeit
dass die Mutter ein paar
Worte spricht Alles was ich
tun kann ist diesen Kindern
ein Leben in Frieden und
Liebe zu wiinschen

And breaking the solemnity of the moment Fritz brings a
forkful of cake to Maria’s mouth

FRITZ
The diet is over you fit
into your wedding dress Now
open your mouth and eat some

YOUNG MARIA
Alright But I have some news
for you This is the last
time you’re telling me what
to do

FRITZ (CONTD)
Die Zeit des Abmagerns ist
vorbei du passt doch in dein
Brautkleid Jetzt mach den
Mund auf und iss

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Gut Aber ich sage dir das
ist das letzte Mal dass du
mir sagst was ich tun soll

And everybody laughs as Maria takes a giant bite of the cake

INT LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT

And now everyone is dancing - the family the guests the old
and the young And as the pace of the dance picks up there is
a sense in all of them that this may well be the final dance
There is spirit and warmth in the dancers but there is also
the knowledge that this is the end of an era And with that
knowledge the dance turns slightly frenzied manic as if
all who dance are trying to dance their way out of the
terrible fate that awaits them

INT ARCHIVES OFFICE MINISTRY OF CULTURE DAY 1998

Randy and Maria are sitting waiting for someone from the
Archive Department No-one is paying much attention to them
Randy looks at the clock on the wall

RANDY
Forty-five minutes

MARTA
Something tells me we’ll be doing a
lot of waiting in Austria

An ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE appears a stern looking woman in her
fifties She is holding a file She speaks German

ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
Your application to search Ihre Anfrage auf
the archives has been Nachforschung im Archiv ist
received but it has not been eingetroffen wurde aber noch
processed yet nicht bearbeitet

Randy tries to reply in German but is useless - he has a very
strong American accent and completely mispronounces the
words

RANDY RANDY (CONT’D)
Quickly please Schnell bitte
ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
We will let you know when Wir werden Sie
permission is granted benachrichtigen sobald die

Freigabe erfolgt ist

And she walks off

RANDY
I think that’s a no

MARIA
That’s Austrian bureaucracy for
you Selectively efficient And by
the way I thought you said you had
forgotten most of the German your
grandmother taught you

RANDY
Thanks Maria that’s kind

MARTA
You haven’t forgotten most of it
You have forgotten all of it

And she’s walking towards the door leaving him reeling in
her wake

INT OFFICE IN MINISTRY OF CULTURE DAY

Randy and Maria are in the office of a junior official in the
Ministry of Culture The man is superficially cordial and
smiles a lot but there is an air of impatience to him as if
he has more pressing matters

JUNIOR OFFICIAL
The Restitution Committee has
decided your case is worthy of a
review Mrs Altmann

MARIA
Young Mr Schoenberg and I have
travelled all this way so wed
appreciate discussing my case with
the Committee before they make any
decisions at all

JUNIOR OFFICIAL
The Committee will not be
interacting with external parties

MARIA
We’re an external party are we

RANDY
The paintings belonged to Mrs
Altmann’s family

JUNIOR OFFICIAL
It is an internal matter But you
must trust that all due procedures
will be followed

And he stands

JUNIOR OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
And now if you don’t mind I have a
reception to go to Do make sure
you enjoy your stay in our
beautiful city It’s been a real
pleasure to meet you

And they are ushered into the reception area and the door has
closed behind them
INT RECEPTION AREA MINISTRY OF CULTURE DAY

Standing in the reception area Maria and Randy try to come
to terms with the manner in which they’ve just been treated

MARIA
This man had the smile of a
psychopath

She jokes but Randy notices she’s been affected by the
meeting

RANDY
How are you doing

MARIA
I’m wondering if I have the
strength to deal with these people
And we’ve only been here a day

And she gives him a vulnerable smile

EXT THE BELVEDERE DAY

Randy Maria and Hubertus are walking towards the main
entrance of the Belvedere in the morning sunshine

RANDY
It looks like we’re not going to
get a copy of the will before we
have to leave after all

MARIA
The archive department wasn’t
exactly helpful

HUBERTUS
Thankfully I have what is commonly
known as a ‘mole’ in the Belvedere
Someone who can speed things up

Hubertus hands Randy a piece of paper with a number on it

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
On Mondays the museum is all locked
up But my friendly mole will be
waiting for you I hope you’re not
allergic to a little dust

MARTA
Didn’t I tell you he was going to
be useful Randy

HUBERTUS
Be patient Maria He’1ll soon come
to see that some Austrians are his
friends whatever their motives

RANDY
Keep working at it

And Randy’s little retort is enough for us to know that his
doubts about Hubertus are thawing

INT THE BELVEDERE DAY

Maria Randy and Hubertus are walking through the Belvedere
galleries Suddenly Maria stops in her tracks She sees a
portrait she recognises It is the Klimt portrait of Amalie
Zuckerkandl

MARTA
Amalie Zuckerkandl Also painted by
Klimt She was a friend of our
family She was murdered by the
Nazis

HUBERTUS
At Belzec death camp yes Mrs
Altmann your aunt is around this
corner Are you ready for the
reunion

They turn the corner and there she is Klimt’s portrait of
Adele The emotion is evident on Maria’s face and she can’t
help but whisper her aunt’s name to herself

MARIA
Aunt Adele

Randy too is bewitched by the painting he stares up at it in
awe and admiration

HUBERTUS
Rightly or wrongly she has become
embedded in Austria’s identity A
national icon Adele has become
part of the country’s psyche

But as he talks Maria’s mind has travelled to the distant
past --

CUT TO

INT THE ADELE ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT 1924

Young Maria looks up at the Klimt painting of her aunt which
now hangs on the wall Adele approaches her

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Do you like it Gefallt es dir
CHILD MARIA CHILD MARIA (CONT’D)
Why is it all gold Warum ist da soviel gold

Adele sits on the sofa indicates to Maria that she should
come sit on her knee She does so Together they look up at
the painting

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Ignore all the gold That’s Vergiss das ganze Gold Das
Klimt Look at my face ist Klimt Schau lieber statt

instead Does it resemble me dessen lieber auf mein
Gesicht Ist es mir ahnlich

CHILD MARIA CHILD MARIA (CONT’D)
Yes But I don’t think you Ja Aber du schaust nicht
look happy gliicklich aus

Adele is taken aback by her perception and honesty

ADELE ADELE (CONT’ D)
I wonder what it will be like Ich frage mich wie es sein
to be a woman when you are wird wenn du erwachsen bist
older Whether you will have wenn du eine frau geworden
to amuse yourself with bist Ob du dich wohl mit
trivialities belanglosigkeiten zufrieden

geben musst

She looks at her niece and sees a reflection

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Or maybe time will change Vielleicht dandern sich ja die
things Zeiten

INT THE BELVEDERE DAY

Suddenly the voice of a tour-guide brings her back to the
present The tour-guide is an Austrian woman and her
followers are a pack of teenage school-children

TOUR GUIDE TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
Austria’s own Woman in Gold Osterreichs Goldene Adele
painted by Klimt One of our gemalt von Klimt Eines
most famous paintings a unserer beriihmtesten Gemalde
glorious example of Austria’s ein herausragendes Beispiel
heritage Osterreichischen Kulturerbes

Maria can not control herself Suddenly unexpectedly she
snaps

MARTA MARIA (CONT’D)
She was stolen by thieves Sie wurde von Dieben
gestohlen

The tour guide and the students look at her as if she is a
mad woman and then move to another painting Some of the
teenagers giggle at her Maria pulls herself together

RANDY
Maria

With shaking hands she takes out of her bag a small camera

MARIA
Excuse the temper of an eccentric
old woman Mr Czernin will you
kindly take a photograph of me and
Randy please

HUBERTUS
With pleasure

Maria and Randy pose in front of the painting Hubertus is
about to take the shot when they are approached by a gruff
guard

GUARD
Taking photographs is forbidden

And just as quickly Maria has returned to her usual self
Calmly almost flirtatiously she turns to the guard

MARIA
This woman is my aunt and this
painting belongs to my family For
once please make an exception to
your rules

She leans forward and peers at his name-tag

MARIA (CONTD)
Franz Thank-you You are very
kind and most understanding

The guard is dumb-struck speechless

MARIA (CONTD)
Come on Randy Relax and smile

And they pose for Hubertus who’s enjoyed what he’s just
witnessed As he takes the photograph we see the two women’s
faces in close proximity - aunt and niece past and present --

EXT VIENNA DAY 1938

12th of March 1938 the Anschluss Nazi troops marching down
the streets of Vienna - and the crowds are jubilant People
are throwing flowers Maria and Fritz have come to witness it
all They stand behind the crowd trying to blend in but
find it increasingly difficult They then run off into a side
street off the main thoroughfare and see streams of joyous
young people running in the opposite direction to them and
towards the celebrations Alarmed by all they see they run

They all run over to where Therese is by the window and look
out There is a commotion on the street outside a woman in a
fur coat has been forced to her knees by a group of people
and made to scrub the pavement The liquid she is using is
obviously caustic - she seems to be in terrible pain when it
comes into contact with her skin It is the same moment that
Maria saw in her nightmare on the plane on the way to Vienna

YOUNG MARTA
It’s Mrs Klein The wife of
the doctor

THERESE
What are they doing What are

And now they are all sitting around Gustav who is playing the
cello And Therese continues to weep quietly But there is an
extraordinary dignity to the family in this moment

EXT A VIENNA STREET DAY

Outside the Passport Office make shift tables have been set
up to deal with a barrage of people requesting passports
Hundreds of people shouting pushing and a general sense of
panic Two officials sit at the table and are being assailed
from every direction Maria and Fritz are at the front and
one of the officials is looking at their paper-work Maria
in crisis seems to be finding a new strength

YOUNG MARIA
My husband’s brother is in
England and my uncle in

to stay in both countries
There’s only four of us but
we need to leave Austria as
soon as possible

A young Jewish boy is being forced by a group of young Nazis
to write JUDEN on the wall of his father’s bakery One of the
young Nazis jeers at him

YOUNG NAZI MAN YOUNG NAZI MAN (CONT’D)
You had it coming to you Jetzt hast du dein Fett weg
Jewish scum Judenbengel

Maria and Fritz walk past nervously appalled by what they
see People are rushing to and fro Vienna is a city in
turmoil And then as they run down the road they see another
man painting JUDEN on a wall As they pass the corner they
see a Jewish family being turfed out of their house

EXT THE BELVEDERE GALLERY DAY 1998

On a beautiful morning Randy and Maria make their way to the
Belvedere to meet Hubertus’ mole and search the archives

RANDY
I really think I could have done
this on my own Maria

MARTA
I wasn’t going to miss the fun
part It’s like a James Bond film
and you are Sean Connery

And as they approach the main entrance they are met by ANNA
a chic young woman who works behind the scenes at the
Belvedere

ANNA
Hello I’m Anna It’s an honour to
meet you

INT THE BELVEDERE BUNKER —- DAY

Anna guides Randy and Maria into the area behind the scenes
passing through a security barrier with a special ID They
pass many works of art which are in temporary storage

ANNA
Technically what we’re doing is not
illegal I can authorise it But
still your discretion will be
appreciated I like my job I want
to keep it

RANDY
Discretion assured

MARIA
Wed never want to get a nice woman
like you into trouble would we
Randy

ANNA
Everything from the museum records
prior to 1972 is held in the same
room But I have to warn you - none
of it has been computerised yet

She opens a door which leads to a vast room of archives

INT BELVEDERE ARCHIVE ROOM DAY

Standing in the doorway Randy Maria and Anna look at the
room - hundreds of cabinets which contain thousands of files

ANNA
I think you’re going to have a busy
day

MARTA

Roll up your sleeves Randy

INT BELVEDERE ARCHIVE ROOM DAY

A montage of Randy and Maria over the whole day as they
rummage through thousands of files and documents The clock
on the wall indicates the passing hours

INT BELVEDERE ARCHIVE ROOM NIGHT
Just before midnight Randy finds the file he’s looking for

RANDY
Eureka

He opens it- and sees pages and pages of documents from the

1930s and 40s He throws it to Maria She looks down at it -
in big bold letters on the front of the file it has a name

BLOCH-BAUER She looks up at Randy moved and excited

MARIA
This is it

INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY

The next morning Hubertus is holding photocopies of all the
documents Maria and Randy are with him in his beautiful
large study of his flat on the top floor of a Vienna palais -
the house of an intellectual cultured man

HUBERTUS
Congratulations Quite a treasure
trove of information

RANDY
Hubertus and I were up all night
doing some homework

MARIA
I’m happy to see you’re getting on
so well

RANDY

And now we can start putting
together a picture of all that

happened

HUBERTUS
Maria you are the living link to
the past

MARIA

Hanging on with my finger-nails

HUBERTUS
Tell us what you know

MARTA
My aunt Adele died in 1925

INT ADELE’S BEDROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT 1925

Adele is dead laid out in her bed with a weeping Ferdinand
by her side

MARIA
Meningitis She was only forty
three years old My uncle was
devastated He said that a large
part of him died with her

INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY

RANDY
Was there ever talk of a will

MARIA
I remember my uncle mentioning that
shed written one

RANDY
She had In 1923 two years before
her death

HUBERTUS

And now thanks to your brilliant
detective work

Hubertus picks out of the photocopies a copy of the will
shows it to Maria Adele’s signature stands out

MARIA
Her signature mein Gott

HUBERTUS
I’ll translate as accurately as I
can This is the part which
interests us

He starts to translate a part of the will to them

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
“I kindly ask my husband to
bequeath”

INT STUDY ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT 1923

In Gustav’s study with Gustav standing by her side Adele
writes her will

HUBERTUS
“my portrait and the other Klimt
paintings after his death to the
Belvedere Gallery in Vienna”

And we watch her signing it Adele Bloch-Bauer

ADELE
Adele Bloch-Bauer

INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY

MARTA
So she did leave them to the
gallery after all Dear me we’ve
come all this way for nothing Is
this what’s known as an anti-climax
Randy

HUBERTUS
One step at a time You’re right
Maria she does in fact request for
the paintings to go to the
Belvedere but the request has a
very specific condition attached to
it

And he picks up the will again reads a phrase from it

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
“Nach seinem Tode”

MARIA
‘After his death’

RANDY
She specifically asks for the
painting to be given to the
Belvedere after Ferdinand’s death

HUBERTUS
Let’s tell the story
chronologically Maria do you have
any idea of what happened to your
family’s property after you got
away
MARIA
Not at all Unlike Lo
never looked back

HUBERTUS
But maybe now it’s ti
Randy why don’t you
the home-work you’ve

MARIA
I don’t care if it’s
the morning Pour me

ts wife I

me to know
tell us about
been doing

ten o’clock in
a stiff drink

INT LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE DAY 1939

The space is full of the cream of the Nazi hierarchy and
various art curators - all of them walking around the house

admiring the art making notes

RANDY
After you escaped Aus

cutting deals

tria Maria

your house became the scene of what
can only be described as one of the
great Viennese auctions of the day

HUBERTUS

Your family’s belongings ended up
in the hands of the most powerful
criminals of the Nazi elite

INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY

This news is affecting Maria every new piece of information

like a stab in the heart

MARIA

All our personal things

RANDY

Handed over to whoever took a shine
to them And they had a word for

it

HUBERTUS
Aryanisation

EXT ELIZABETHSTRASSE —- DAY

Two men in Nazi uniform are carrying a painting out of the
house and loading it into the back of a small truck The
painting is not visible covered in cloth

HUBERTUS

Did you know for instance that one
of your uncle’s favourite

paintings a Waldmull
Count Esterhazy as a

er portrait of
boy

INT THE LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE DAY

And Maria as a small child is going through her uncle’s stamp
collection with Ferdinand by her side They are sitting on
the sofa and on the wall above them hangs the Waldmuller

MARIA
I remember it it was in the living-
room One of his favourite
paintings

INT BERGHOF DAY

And the painting is unveiled in a room near a window through
which we catch a glimpse of snow-capped mountains

HUBERTUS
ended up decorating the walls of
no less a place than the Berghof
Hitler’s private residence in the
Bavarian Alps

And we see the back of a man whom we suspect is Hitler
admiring the new acquisition

INT VIENNA STATE OPERA NIGHT

A glittering audience populated by Nazis and their female
companions fill the Opera House during a performance of a
Wagner opera On stage a tenor sings an aria And in the
audience on one of the balconies HERMAN GOERING sits next
to his young wife EMMY who is wearing Adele’s necklace and
glows with the knowledge that all admiring eyes are on her

HUBERTUS
Or that your Aunt’s necklace the
same one she wears in the Klimt
portrait came to adorn the neck of
Emmy Goering Herman Goering’s
young wife

INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY
Maria’s devastation grows as she hears of the fate of her

family’s most treasured possessions She takes a swig of the
bourbon that Hubertus has poured for her

MARIA
I almost wish you hadn’t told me
all this

HUBERTUS

None of the proceeds of this sale
of course trickled through to your
family

MARTA
Not a shilling

INT THE ADELE ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT

A man sits in the Adele room looking up at the portrait in
admiration as he smokes a cigar BRUNO GRIMSHITZ

HUBERTUS
The Nazis themselves were not that
keen on the Klimts - they were
after all a little too degenerate
for their taste But the paintings
caught the eye of someone with a
more prescient and refined
appreciation of art Bruno
Grimshitz the Director of the
Belvedere Gallery

INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY

MARTA
Grimshitz An appropriately named
character

INT THE ADELE ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT

And now we watch the portrait of Adele being taken off the
wall in Elizabethstrasse by two men in Nazi uniform with
Grimshitz supervising

HUBERTUS
The paintings were taken off the
walls of your family home and
carefully transported to what
became their final resting place

INT THE BELVEDERE DAY

And we watch the portrait of Adele being hung carefully in
the Gallery as Grimshitz looks on

RANDY
Grimshitz knew a masterpiece when
he saw it

And then out of nowhere a constantly changing parade of
museum visitors through the post-war decades from 1946 to the
present pass by the painting many pausing to admire it

HUBERTUS
Of course certain facts had to be
altered Like your Aunt’s name for
instance And her Jewish provenance
of course For a short while after
the war she became simply known
as

And a visitor leans in to observe the name of the painting
written on a plaque WOMAN IN GOLD
INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY

RANDY
Woman in Gold

MARIA
Even her identity was stolen from
her

HUBERTUS

It was not enough to rob your
family and try to destroy it You
had to be eradicated from history

MARIA
We were Jewish after all

RANDY
So the paintings reached the
Belvedere

HUBERTUS
In 1941 Your uncle if I’m not
mistaken Maria died

MARTA
At the end of the war in forty-
five

HUBERTUS

A whole four years later

RANDY
So contrary to the request in
Adele’s will they were there well
before his death

MARIA
He died in that hotel in Zurich
alone having lost everything

HUBERTUS
And if I’m not mistaken he wrote
his own will before he died

MARTA
He did yes

INT HOTEL BEDROOM ZURICH DAY

Ferdinand writes a will in his hotel bedroom and we see
two names of his nieces as he pens them Luise Maria

HUBERTUS
Leaving his entire fortune or at
least the shreds that were left of
it to you and your sister his
only living heirs

the

INT HOTEL BEDROOM ZURICH NIGHT

Ferdinand sits on the edge of his bed staring into the past
alone approaching the end of his life

HUBERTUS
It was one of the last things he
did before he died a few days
later

INT HUBERTUS’ STUDY DAY

HUBERTUS
After the war your sister appointed
the lawyer Johann Rinesch to see
what he could do An honest man I
think but slightly ineffectual

RANDY
That’s a kind understatement

HUBERTUS
He started making inquiries about
the will but didn’t get very far

RANDY
Eventually the Belvedere persuaded
him to sign the export permits as
guarantee that you’d never go after
the Klimts

HUBERTUS
And from that point on either
through oversight or intent the
manner in which the paintings got
to the Belvedere in the first place
was concealed

MARIA
So for decades the truth was
obscured

RANDY
Until now

MARIA
But even if all this happened the
simple fact is that Adele’s will
does ask for them to go there So
we haven’t really got a case

HUBERTUS
Weve kept the best for last Randy
why don’t you show Maria our trump
card

And Randy triumphantly brings out an official looking
document form the Bloch-Bauer file

MARIA
What’s this

RANDY
A declaration by your father that
Ferdinand paid for the paintings
He was the rightful owner not

Adele

HUBERTUS
The paintings weren’t hers to give
away

And the magnitude of what they reveal suddenly dawns on her

MARIA
The will is invalid

RANDY
Technically it’s not even a will
It’s not legally binding It’s a
wish that’s all

MARIA
Adele’s wish

HUBERTUS
So now we need to get all this to
Rudolf Wran the head of the
restitution committee

Randy punches the air starts moving around the room he
can’t control his excitement

RANDY
Yes And then your aunt is coming
home with us Maria

HUBERTUS
Randy wait take a deep breath
sit down listen

Randy does as he’s told he sits

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
She is the Mona Lisa of Austria
Randy

RANDY
I don’t care if she’s Botticelli’s
fucking Venus They haven’t got a
leg to stand on

Maria and Hubertus look at each other

MARIA
That’s what happens when he gets
excited He starts expanding his
vocabulary

INT THE RESTITUTION COMMITTEE OFFICES DAY
Randy and Maria are trying to arrange a meeting with RUDOLF

WRAN the chairman of the Restitution Committee but are not
having much luck with his receptionist

RANDY
The thing is I’ve already left him
four messages this morning

SECRETARY
Mr Wran is very busy you
understand

MARIA
We realise that but it’s essential
that we speak to him

SECRETARY

Why don’t you leave him a message
MARTA

My dear girl we’re going around in

circles

Suddenly at the far end of the room two men walk out of
Wran’s office and start to make their way to the main
entrance of the building Maria spots them

MARIA (CONTD)
Is that him Randy

Randy looks and starts to move towards him with speed Maria
in tow The secretary shouts after them

SECRETARY
I think it’s best if you leave a
message

Randy and Maria catch up with Wran who is now alone - the
other man has left the building Randy is out of breath

RANDY
Mr Wran Rudolf Wran

Wran looks apprehensive

RANDY (CONTD)
Randy Schoenberg And this is my
client Mrs Altmann

WRAN
Of course I am so sorry I haven’t
had a moment to reply to your
calls

Maria decides to play her flattering card

MARIA
Please don’t apologise important
men like yourself must be very
busy

RANDY
There’s quite a bit of new
information the restitution
committee needs to be aware of
before it comes to any sort of
decision about the Bloch-Bauer
case

WRAN
Is there indeed

Randy gives Wran the folder

RANDY
It’s all in there I’ve made some
observations in the margins

WRAN
You’ve been busy during your stay
in Vienna I see

MARIA
We didn’t come here to eat cakes

WRAN
Mr Schoenberg I heard you are the
composer’s grandson Do you know
what a fan I am of his work

RANDY
Glad to hear it

MARIA
I can tell you have very refined
taste Mr Wran

WRAN
The genius of the twelve tone
compositional system should not be
underestimated

RANDY
I couldn’t agree more

WRAN
Thank you for your efforts But we
have all the information we need
He places the file back in Randy’s hands
WRAN (CONTD)
Now if you’ll excuse me there is
work to be done
Wran is off and Randy is left holding the file
RANDY
At least he’s a fan of my
grandfather’s music

MARTA
That fills me with confidence
EXT ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS DAY
In the morning sunlight Randy and Maria approach the Academy

On a big sign outside it reads ART RESTITUTION CONFERENCE

RANDY
So weird to think that Hitler once
applied to be an art student here

MARIA
I wish they’d accepted him Who
cares if he wasn’t a Picasso It
would have been a lot better if he
had spent his life doing tacky
paintings

INT ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS VIENNA DAY

The main room is full of descendants of families who had
their art looted by the Nazis and also by members of the
government and media The room is buzzing Before the
speakers commence all the invited guests are having coffees
Maria Randy and Hubertus are standing in the middle of the
throng Maria looking resplendent in a pink suit

HUBERTUS
Theyre all here The woman just
coming in the door

We see ELIZABETH GEHRER being welcomed into the room

RANDY
Elizabeth Gehrer Minister of
Culture

And we see Rudolf Wran greeting her with an embrace

HUBERTUS

the restitution committee

MARIA
Our music lover

HUBERTUS
Quite a turn-out They’re putting
on a very good show

INT ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS DAY

Everyone is seated and there’s a procession of speakers at
the podium and we hear snippets of their speeches The first
speaker is Elizabeth Gehrer The whole event is being filmed
for TV

GEHRER
Welcome to the Restitution
Conference This is a first step in
beginning to make reparation
towards those whose art was
unlawfully taken away from them
INT ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS DAY

And now we watch a montage of elder

ly refugees and Holocaust

survivors giving their testimonies on the art that was stolen

from their families Firstly a wom

We watch Maria’s reaction to these
resonate with her And now an elde

speeches and how they
rly man with a strong

German accent is speaking from the podium

OLD MAN

I will never forget the day that
they stormed into our house and
took our paintings off the walls
We sat there not being able to say

anything to do anything

INT ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS DAY

It’s Maria’s turn she is on the p
quiet confidence - but it is not ea
slightly with emotion

MARIA

odium and speaking with
sy her voice trembles

When people see the portrait of my

aunt they see a masterpiece by one
of Austria’s finest artists When I
see it I see a woman who talked to
me about philosophy while I brushed

her hair and who told me
biting my nails

There is a ripple of laughter from
particular memory

MARIA (CONTD)
A woman who had she not
young would have had to
Austria or die in a camp
she was Jewish You see

off for

the audience at this very

died
escape
because

restitution is an interesting word
Of course it means compensation
but it means something else as
well I looked it up in the

dictionary

There is some laughter from the aud
glasses and reads from a small piec

ience as she puts on her
e of paper

MARIA (CONTD)
‘Restitution the return of
something to its original state’

She puts down the paper looks at her audience

MARIA (CONTD)
I know I can’t be a little girl
again but like so many of my
generation who were forced to flee
from this city I would like to
return to my original state I
would like to be re-united with my
family

As she speaks these words quietly and with dignity she
can’t help the emotion leaking through And we watch how her
words affect Randy

EXT ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS DUSK

The conference is over and people are leaving through the
main doors into the cold Vienna evening Randy and Maria are
on the steps of the building As Maria is putting on her
coat they are approached by BERNARD KOHLER a high-ranking
employee of the Belvedere He hands her his card she looks
at it Randy is immediately suspicious

KOHLER
Mrs Altmann Bernard Kohler I
work at the Belvedere Gallery

MARIA
How can I help you Mr Kohler

KOHLER
If the decision of the committee is
in your favour take the three
landscapes But we implore you not
the portraits

MARTA
You have grown attached to them

KOHLER
We can not imagine Austria without
them

MARIA
Once the past has been put to
right I would be open to reaching
an arrangement with you

KOHLER
I am delighted to hear it After
all we are all victims of history
Mrs Altmann

Randy is incredulous at what he’s hearing

RANDY
Maria can I speak to you for a
minute

MARIA

Now if you’ll excuse me I have a
feeling that my lawyer is getting a
trifle nervous

KOHLER
My phone number is on the card
Please feel free to call me so we
can resume the conversation

Kohler smiles gives a little bow and walks away Randy is
fuming

RANDY
I think we should be careful what
we say Maria

MARIA
What you mean is you think I should
be careful what I say

RANDY
Just now you called me your
lawyer People tend to take advice
from their lawyers

MARTA
When they ask for it Now if
youve finished lecturing me I
think I’m going to walk back to
the hotel

And she walks off Randy watches her go shakes his head
irritated The tensions of the visit are getting to them
both Hubertus approaches him holding his phone He has
just received a text message He shows it to Randy

HUBERTUS
Bad news they’ve postponed the
announcement of the verdict till
Wednesday

RANDY
Perfect Two days after I’m
expected back at work That’s just
perfect

(NB - RANDY’S LINE IS COPIED HERE AND BELOW SO THAT THE
BELOW SCENE CAN BE ADDED WITHOUT CREATING EXTRA PAGES)

EXT ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS DUSK

Annoyed by her small altercation with Randy Maria starts to
make her way down the steps of the Academy But halfway down
the steps an elderly aristocratic Austrian man who is
putting his jacket on talks to her casually throwing his
words over his shoulder not looking at her in the eyes

ELDERLY AUSTRIAN MAN
A powerful speech you gave But
when will you let the past be the
past You people never give up do
you Not everything is about the

Holocaust

She reels at this sudden unexpected burst of anti-Semitism
For a second she looks as if she might reply But then she
decides that this man does not merit an answer She moves on
down the steps and towards the road her dignity intact

RANDY

Perfect Two days after I’m
expected back at work That’s just

perfect

EXT PHARMACY VIENNA STREET NIGHT

Maria is walking through the back-streets of the old town
when she suddenly sees a place she recognises - an old
pharmacy that doesn’t look as if it’s changed in a hundred
years She stops looks through the window She lifts her

hand and touches it

as if convincing herself that she’s not

imagining it And then memories come flooding back --

Jewish So the least you can
do is let us go and get him
some medication from the
pharmacy

HEINRICH
And why do both of you need
to go

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Sie wissengenau so gut wie
ich dass sie meinem Vater
nicht erlauben ins spital zu
gehen weil er das Verbrechen
begangen hat Jude zu sein
Wir kOnnen nur zur Apotheke
gehen und ihm Medikamente
holen

HEINRICH (CONTD)
Und warum miissen Sie beide
gehen

And now Maria turns with real stridency to Heinrich she is
becoming a force to be reckoned with

YOUNG MARIA
Oh for God’s sake if you’re
that worried we’re going to
run away why don’t you come
with us

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Ach Um Himmels Willen wenn
Sie so besorgt sind dass wir
weglaufen warum kommen Sie
nicht mit

Heinrich resigns grudgingly picks up his coat

HEINRICH
I take you there but we come
straight back

YOUNG MARIA
That’s a shame I was hoping
we could all go to the
cinema

HEINRICH (CONTD)
Ich bringe Sie hin aber wir
kommen sofort zurtick

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Schade Ich hatte gehofft
wir gehen alle zusammen ins
Kino

And she throws Fritz a look this is it

EXT PHARMACY VIENNA STREET DUSK

It is dusk as Maria Fritz and Heinrich arrive at the
pharmacy on a quiet side street It is the same pharmacy that
Maria comes across as an older woman As they approach
Heinrich takes out a pack of cigarettes

HEINRICH
I’m going to smoke a
cigarette Don’t be longer
than a minute

HEINRICH (CONTD)
Ich rauche eine Zigarette
Sie haben eine Minute

The relief is evident on Maria’s face Everything is going
according to plan

YOUNG MARIA YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
One minute that’s all Eine Minute Das reicht

And Maria and Fritz walk in

INT THE PHARMACY DUSK

Through the window we can see Heinrich smoking Maria leads
Fritz up to the counter They are both nervous and the
PHARMACIST a hawk-like man picks up on it He gives them a
wary look Maria clocks the door that leads to the back of
the pharmacy

PHARMACIST PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
What can I do for you Was darf es sein

YOUNG MARIA YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
My father has a very high Mein Vater hat sehr hohes
fever and a cough We need Fieber und Husten Wir
something that will help brauchen etwas das die
lower his temperature Temperatur senkt

PHARMACIST PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Wait here Warten Sie hier

He makes his way towards the medicine shelves which stand at
the back of the area behind the counter Maria takes Fritz by
the hand and they go to the door that leads to the back of
the shop They open it and dart through it

INT CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY DUSK

Maria and Fritz rush down a small corridor at the rear of the
pharmacy towards a door that leads to the back street They
try and open it but it is locked They both start to panic as
they look around for another way out But there isn’t one
Fritz notices a big bunch of keys hanging on the wall He
grabs them and starts trying different keys in the door
looking for the right one Maria keeps looking over her
shoulder

INT THE PHARMACY DUSK

The pharmacist turns back towards the counter with the
medication in hand

PHARMACIST PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
This should do it Das sollte helfen

But he sees they’ve gone He looks around the shop can’t see
them Then he notices Heinrich in his uniform waiting for
them outside He becomes suspicious

And then he sees the open door that leads to the corridor He
goes through it like a dog on the scent of something

INT THE CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY DUSK

The pharmacist walks into the corridor and sees Maria and
Fritz trying the different keys in the door

PHARMACIST
What are you doing

YOUNG MARIA
I’m feeling faint I need
some air Please open the
door

PHARMACIST
This is a private area If
you want air go out the way
you came in

PHARMACIST (CONTD)
Was machen Sie da

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Ich fiihle mich schwach Ich
brauche etwas Luft Bitte
6ffnen Sie die Tiir

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Dies ist ein privater
Bereich Wenn Sie Luft

Fritz is desperately trying the keys in the door

PHARMACIST
Put those keys down You have
no business being here

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Legen Sie diese Schliissel
hin Sie haben hier nichts zu
suchen

Maria knows she can’t keep the act going She tries to appeal

to his kindness

YOUNG MARIA
Please Please let us out We
have done nothing wrong
Please help us

PHARMACIST
The soldier smoking on the
street is with you

YOUNG MARIA
No Please quickly open the
door

PHARMACIST

PHARMACIST (CONTD)

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)

And then he figures it out

PHARMACIST PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Of course you are Jews Natiirlich Sie sind Juden

And he runs back into the shop and starts shouting to
Heinrich on the street

PHARMACIST PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
They are trying to get away Die versuchen abzuhauen

EXT THE PHARMACY DUSK

Heinrich hears the pharmacist calling him He throws his
cigarette on the pavement and runs into the pharmacy

INTEXT THE CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY DUSK

And just as Heinrich comes hurtling into the corridor from
the pharmacy Fritz finds the right key to the door opens
it takes the key out again He and Maria go darting out into
a courtyard at the rear of the building

EXT PHARMACY COURTYARD DUSK

Fritz and Maria burst through the door just as Heinrich
reaches it They struggle as Heinrich tries to open the door
and Fritz to close it Then when he manages to slam it shut
Fritz quickly sticks the key in the lock and locks it We can
hear Heinrich pounding on it Fritz and Maria leap up the
steps into the courtyard area where a woman is hanging her
laundry For a second her eyes meet Maria’s she could go
either way But she decides to help them She points to the
exit

WOMAN IN COURTYARD WOMAN IN COURTYARD (CONT’D)
That way Hier lang

Maria and Fritz run out of the courtyard and into the
streets

INTEXT THE CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY DUSK

And in the corridor Heinrich is cursing and looking for a
way out He sees a fire hydrant picks it up smashes it
against the door The door panels break he sticks his arm
through them and unlocks the door from the other side He
opens the door and rushes out in close pursuit past the
woman with her washing and into the street

EXT VIENNA BACK STREETS DUSK

Maria and Fritz are running at break neck speed down the
little back streets They reach a small juncture in the road
and for a second seem lost Maria grabs Fritz by the arm

YOUNG MARIA YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
The Town Hall is this way Das Rathaus ist hier entlang

And they tear off again down one of the streets

EXT VIENNA BACK STREETS DUSK

Maria and Fritz are running through a maze of Vienna’s back
streets They suddenly find themselves at what looks like a
cul-de-sac and stop in their tracks But then Maria notices
some steps at the end of the road

YOUNG MARIA YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Come There are steps Komm Hier sind Stufen

They reach the steps and start running down them but when
they are half way down they spot Heinrich at the bottom of
the steps looking for them He doesn’t see them Quietly
they stop and turn around start inching their way to the top
again

But suddenly two fur-clad loud women appear at the top of
the stairs mid-conversation and laughing at something The
noise attracts Heinrich’s attention he looks up and sees
Fritz and Maria They break into a run pushing by the two
women as they tear past the top of the stairs One of the
women nearly falls over and just as she regains her balance
Heinrich shoots past her knocking her over He chases after
Maria and Fritz Fritz slips on a step and Heinrich grabs
hold of his coat Fritz struggles to get away shouts at
Maria

FRITZ FRITZ (CONT’D)
Go Gol Lauf Lauf

For a second she vacillates then runs off Fritz is
struggling to free himself from Heinrich’s clutches

EXT BUS DEPOT DUSK

Maria is running down the paved back-streets again but now
the Town Hall can be seen ahead As she enters the building
complex she runs under the arches and starts weaving her
way through the columns and through the crowds of people on
their evening walks Suddenly she finds herself in a gaggle
of people who surround an Orthodox Jewish man who is having
his ringlets cut off In horror she looks on then looks up
again and sees Fritz standing in the crowd He smiles for a
second - they have found each other again - but makes a sign
for her to be quiet He draws her attention to a door behind
them and starts to move towards it But then Heinrich comes
running towards the crowd Fritz grabs Maria by the hand and
they push their way through the people and open the door
disappearing into the depot

But one of the women in the crowd has spotted them sees
Heinrich gets suspicious and decides to betray them She
shouts to Heinrich

WOMAN IN QUEUE WOMAN IN QUEUE (CONT’D)
Here They’ve gone in here Da Da sind sie hinein

Heinrich is still a couple of hundred feet away but he starts
running towards the woman and the door

INT BUS DEPOT DUSK

Maria and Fritz burst into the bus depot area and find
themselves on a balcony above the place where the car is

arked in amongst a couple of resting buses Maria spots it
immediately

YOUNG MARIA YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
It’s there Da Da ist der Wagen

And they tear down the stairs towards it knowing their
escape is just seconds away Three steps at a time they leap
down the two flights of stairs and throw themselves into the
back of the waiting car The engine roars into action just as
Heinrich appears on the balcony above them He pulls out a
gun takes aim and shoots at the car The bullet hits the
boot but the car escapes through the depot doors and into the
night Heinrich bangs his gun against the railings

HEINRICH HEINRICH (CONT’D)
Shit ScheifBe

EXT VIENNA AERODROME DUSK

The car arrives outside the small aerodrome People
everywhere with suitcases but also a large number of Nazi
soldiers Maria and Fritz jump out and through the front
window they thank Mr Feldmann Fritz’s brother’s friend
Fritz shakes his hand

YOUNG MARIA YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Thank you so much Vielen Dank

MR FELDMANN MR FELDMANN (CONT’D)
I’d do anything for your Ich wiirde alles fiir deine
family Good luck Familie tun Viel Gliick

And he drives off Maria and Fritz turn around take a moment
to compose themselves and enter the aerodrome

INT VIENNA AERODROME DUSK
Fritz and Maria are at the check-in trying to look as casual

as possible A female employee of the airline is checking
them in when they are approached by a Nazi officer

NAZI OFFICER NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)

Maria hands him their tickets which he scans

NAZI OFFICER

Cologne yes

NAZI OFFICER

NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)

FRITZ (CONTD)

Fritz is about to talk but looks as if he might lose it

sounds so far-fetched that he does he hands back the papers

NAZI OFFICER
Good luck

YOUNG MARIA
Thank you

NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Dankeschon

And he moves on And then there is an announcement made for
the departure of the Cologne flight And the passengers start
to cross the tarmac in order to board the plane

EXT THE AERODROME FIELD DUSK

It’s getting dark now and the passengers form a queue on the
tarmac in preparation to board the plane A stewardess stands

at the bottom of the aircraft stairs

Suddenly one of the

pilots emerges from the plane and comes down the steps He
whispers something to the stewardess and she then turns to

the passengers

STEWARDESS
Ladies and gentlemen bad
news I’m afraid Due to
extreme weather conditions
our departure will be delayed

for the inconvenience

STEWARDESS (CONTD)
Meine Damen und Herren
Aufgrund der extremen

Unannehmlichkeiten

Some of the passengers make noises of protestation and
annoyance but Maria and Fritz just look at each other with
anxiety

THE THE AERODROME FIELD NIGHT

A few minutes have passed and then the pilot gives a sign to
the stewardess from the top of the steps She turns to the
passengers

STEWARDESS STEWARDESS (CONT’D)
We are now ready to start Wir beginnen jetzt mit dem
boarding Please have your Einsteigen Bitte halten sie

Suddenly a vehicle approaches and stops A YOUNG NAZI
OFFICER and a SOLDIER jump out of it and run up to the queue
Maria and Fritz throw each other a nervous look whilst still
trying to act composed The officer comes to the side of the
queue while the soldier bars the passengers from boarding

YOUNG NAZI OFFICER YOUNG NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
There are passengers who will Es gibt Passagiere die heute
not be boarding this flight nicht mitfliegen werden
tonight

He looks down at a piece of paper

YOUNG OFFICIAL YOUNG OFFICIAL (CONT’D)

Nobody replies Then slowly two figures step forward a
well-dressed older man and his teenage son

YOUNG NAZI OFFICER YOUNG NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
Please follow us both of Bitte folgen sie uns
you

And defeated the two men follow them leaving behind them
Mrs Neumann and her younger son 9 looking bereft The
boarding now continues As they climb the steps to board the
aircraft Fritz can hardly suppress his relief But Maria is
looking at the men led away wondering what their fates will
be

EXT THE AERODROME STRIP NIGHT

The small plane takes off in the night for its flight from
Vienna to Cologne

INT THE AIRPLANE NIGHT

Maria looks at Fritz with relief in her eyes But as she
looks out of the window at the fading lights of Vienna below

it is replaced with unfathomable sadness as she thinks of
leaving her mother and father

INT HOTEL RECEPTION DAY 1998

Randy is in the hotel reception area leaning over the
reception counter and talking on the phone to Pam Maria
comes out of the elevator and starts walking towards him

RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
I know it’s just they drag their
feet a lot so the whole thing took
longer than I thought it would

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY
Pam is on the wireless phone Dora is in a stroller

PAM
What did the office say Don’t they
want you back

INT HOTEL RECEPTION DAY

Randy is still on the phone to Pam and Maria is tugging on
his sleeve in an excited state

MARTA
Come on hurry up they’re
announcing the decision in an hour

RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
They’re okay with it so you
needn’t worry How’s Dora

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY

Pam tries to keep it light and playful but she’s feeling
lonely

PAM (ON THE PHONE)
Dora’s missing her Dad Dora’s
decided she’s not a Gustav Klimt
fan and that Vienna sucks She’s
teething and really looking forward
to just a tiny bit of normality in
her life That’s how Dora is How
are you

INT HOTEL RECEPTION DAY

And Maria is tugging on his sleeve again

MARIA
We haven’t got all day hurry up

He turns to her snaps a little
RANDY

Maria it’s Pam it’s my wife Will
you please give me a moment

She’s slightly taken aback by his rather gruff tone He
returns to the phone conversation

RANDY (ON THE PHONE) (CONTD)
I’m sorry honey I need to run I
need to run Love you

He replaces the receiver knows that Pam is not happy

RANDY (CONT’D)
Okay That went well

He’s feeling the pressure and the tensions are slowly rising
But Maria is still at his elbow handing him a scarf

MARIA
And put your scarf on I don’t want
you to catch pneumonia

INT RUDOLF WRAN’S OFFICE DAY

Rudolf Wran Elizabeth Gehrer GOTTFRIED TOMAN and a YOUNG
WOMAN who takes notes throughout the meeting are in the room
Toman is bald elegant with an immaculate beard and sharp
intelligent eyes They are all on edge but cordial as they
greet Maria and Randy Randy has trouble hiding his nerves

WRAN
And this is Minister Gehrer

MARIA
How do you do

GEHRER
Dr Toman here is our principal
attorney on this very complicated
case He has a wide and profound
knowledge of both history and the
law

RANDY
That’s reassuring

GEHRER
Please sit

They all take their seats and the tension is palpable Wran
opens up a folder

WRAN
Some cases are more complicated
than others But after much
deliberation we regret to inform
you Mrs Altmann that the
committee has decided that the five
Klimt paintings hanging in the
Belvedere will remain there

RANDY
Please tell me this is a joke

MARIA
They are not joking Randy

TOMAN
Your Aunt’s will should be obeyed

Randy picks up his brief-case starts to rummage through some
files and papers he has in there

RANDY
But that’s the pointit’s not even
a will The paintings weren’t hers
to give awayhere where is it

A folder falls from his case scattering a whole lot of
papers on the floor He kneels down and starts to pick them
up talking as he does so

RANDY (CONTD)

We have proof that the paintings
were Ferdinand’s property not his
wife’s which makes her will
invalid

He looks up and sees them all staring down at him Toman has
picked up one piece of paper which he hands to him

TOMAN
I think this is the one you are
looking for

RANDY
And that’s ignoring the fact that
there was a deliberate cover-up to
conceal the manner in which the
paintings ended up in the Gallery

MARTA
I don’t think they are interested
in facts Randy

Randy sits back in his chair in shock Toman takes the
opportunity to state his argument

TOMAN
Your Aunt’s request needs to be
respected Mrs Altmann

RANDY
It’s not a legally binding will

Maria tries a different tact She speaks quietly with great
emotion restrained by dignity

MARIA
When my aunt wrote those words
Austria was not the same country
It was not imprisoning and killing
her friends her people

GEHRER
Our decision is non-negotiable If
you don’t agree with it your only
option is to pursue the case in
court

A pause And then Maria stands up

MARIA
Come on Randy let’s go

She makes her way to the door turns around Looks straight
at Toman speaks with a quiet ferocity in her voice

MARIA (CONTD)
You speak of my aunt Dr Toman as
if you knew her You did not know
her And I can tell you now that
what you have decided today would
make her ashamed to call herself an
Austrian And it should make you
ashamed as well

And she opens the door and goes An on the faces of the
Austrians we know that her words have touched a chord

EXT VIENNA STREET DAY

Later that afternoon Maria and Randy are walking back to
their hotel with Hubertus trying to come up with another
solution

HUBERTUS
It’s not America In order to
pursue the case in Austria the
government demands a deposit
against the cost of 18 million
dollars And that’s for starters

MARTA
One point eight million

HUBERTUS
Based on a portion of the estimated
value of the paintings

RANDY
On the one hand they’re saying
‘take us to court’ on another it’s
financially impossible for us to do
so

HUBERTUS
Your hands are tied behind your
back correct

RANDY
What about some sort of
arbitration Here in Vienna

HUBERTUS
Nobody here will decide to give you
back the paintings Randy It would
be a waste of time and money

It’s a dead end and they all know it

MARIA
Hubertus thank you so much for all
your effort

(MORE)

MARIA (CONTD)
But no more day-dreams Come Randy
we have some packing to do

INT MARIAS HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

Maria is at the window of her room the TV on silent in the
background She is looking out over the Vienna roof-tops Her
suit-case is open on the bed Suddenly it looks like she
might break down - all the tensions and frustrations of the
return to Vienna have taken their toll There’s a knock at
the door She pulls herself together and opens it it’s
Randy

RANDY
Just checking on you

MARIA
Come in Sit down

He does as he’s told sits on the edge of her bed as she
continues packing

MARIA (CONTD)
I’m exhausted That’s what happens
when you have to deal with a lot of
grim shits

They laugh together Then she starts to pack

MARIA (CONTD)
They will never admit what they
did Because if they admit to one
thing then they have to admit to
it all

RANDY
Admit to what

MARIA
They were never victims Most of
them threw flowers and opened their
arms to greet the Nazis That’s the
simple truth

Suddenly Randy spots Elizabeth Gehrer on the CNN news He
grabs the remote control and turns on the volume

GEHRER
It is with great pleasure that I
announce that Adele will be
remaining in Austria This is a
victory for the Belvedere Gallery
and a victory for the Austrian
people

Randy picks up a pair of socks he finds on the bed and throws
them at the TV in rage Maria picks up the remote and
switches it off

MARIA
Enough Tomorrow we go home And
on the way to the airport we pay
our respects That way we will not
have come here in vain

EXT THE HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL VIENNA DAY

And in the soft morning light Maria and Randy visit the
Rachel Whiteread Holocaust memorial in Judenplatz Randy is
running his fingers across the engraving of the word
Treblinka

RANDY
The place my great-grandparents
were murdered

MARIA
I remember them well They lived in
a house with a cherry blossom in
the garden She always gave me
sweets when I visited And she had
the most beautiful eyes

RANDY
Like an owl

She is surprised that he remembers how she describes them

MARIA
Your mother reminds me of her

And once again he runs his fingers over the engraved word
RANDY
And then they were taken away in
the middle of the night

Both are clearly affected by this experience

MARTA
Come we should be leaving for the
airport

RANDY

I know perfume and cognac Give me
a minute I just need to use the
men’s room

And he heads to a nearby cafe

INT CAFE TOILETS DAY

Randy is in the toilets and he finds an empty cubicle He
walks in closes the door behind him Something has happened
Everything has accumulated - the stress the disappointment
the injustice And the visit to the memorial has suddenly
made the wound go deeper He erupts banging his fist against
the cubicle wall In this one moment we begin to see how the
events of his experience are changing him profoundly as a
human being

EXT LOS ANGELES DAY

Montage of Los Angeles - the sunshine the freeways the
suburbs the water-sprinklers

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY

Maria Randy Pam Barbara and a few friends have convened
for a welcome-back barbecue Randy stands in the middle of
the group with Pam at his side

RANDY

Grandfather Zeisl once said that
the three things he hated most in
life were Hitler his grandmother
and the Los Angeles sun But right
now I’m going to have to disagree
with him on the third one Right
now everything about Los Angeles
is pretty wonderful

MARTA
If my darling Fritz was still alive
today he would surely be singing an
aria to welcome us back Any excuse
was good enough

BARBARA
Welcome back Ladies and gentlemen
raise your glasses to Randy and
Maria

Laughter and applause They all raise their glasses and
toast Randy and Maria But in that moment as if she can now
read him Maria knows the jollity is a pretense She goes up
to Randy speaks privately

MARIA
We did our best That’s what
matters We did everything we
could The past is the past and now
we must let it go my dear

But they both know it won’t be easy

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM NIGHT

Pam wakes up - Randy isn’t in bed beside her

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Pam comes into the living room finds him lying on the floor
with Dora asleep on his chest

PAM
Randy

RANDY
I went for the money

She looks at him not quite understanding

RANDY (CONTD)
Those paintings are worth over a
hundred million dollars And that’s
why I went out there with her I
went for the money Pam

PAM
It’s okay It’s natural don’t beat
yourself up about it (But now
you’re back and that’s all that
matters )

RANDY
Is it

She doesn’t quite understand what he means But she knows him
enough to know that she’s witnessing a shift in him

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ LIVING ROOM DAY

And we see Randy doing a lot of research over the next year
and a half into various legal matters - on the living room
floor receiving some papers coming through on the fax machine
and we see the heading ART RESTITUTION INTERNATIONAL
CLAIMS

INT RANDY’S OFFICE BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN NIGHT

And in his office too poring over various files at night

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN NIGHT

And then back in the kitchen - and the clock says it’s 3 am
And he’s on the internet and he’s looking under something
titled FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITIES ACT But he’s getting
nowhere he can’t crack it he’s getting frustrated reading
the small print

EXT BARNES AND NOBLE BOOKSTORE DAY

Randy walks towards the bookstore

EXTINT BARNES AND NOBLE BOOKSTORE DAY

Randy is in a Barnes and Noble bookstore in LA looking
through books He’s in the Art section and he suddenly sees a

falls onto another book nearby a glossy Belvedere catalogue
He’s struck by an idea- gets excited He takes the book up to
the counter gives it to the CASHIER

CASHIER

EXT MARIAS BOUTIQUE DAY

Randy runs up to Maria’s shop holding the Belvedere
catalogue He is out of breath He can see Maria through the
window helping a WOMAN CUSTOMER but still rushes in waving
the catalogue

INTEXT MARIA’S BOUTIQUE DAY

As she puts the customer’s sweater into a bag Randy enters
the shop and stands there out of breath and holding the
catalogue Maria is still helping her customer

MARIA
There you go I hope your husband
likes you in it as much as I do

As the Woman Customer walks by Randy on her way out she
can’t help giving him a funny look He smiles back at her

violation of international law

MARIA

owned by an agency of a foreign
state

RANDY
Tick tick tick Three ticks If

want to

He looks at her uncomprehending

MARIA (CONTD)
Don’t you remember what I said to
you Randy There comes a time when
you have to move on

But from his incredulous expression it’s clear that that
time hasn’t yet come for Randy

INT BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN OFFICES DAY

Sherman is striding through the offices late for a lunch
appointment Randy is stalking him excitedly As he walks
Sherman scans a file that Randy has given him

SHERMAN
It’s a long shot For starters
there’s no precedent

RANDY
There’s one case I found it’s in
there Jewish family from Argentina
lost a hotel Sued the Argentinians
over here because they’d advertised
the hotel in the US

They get to the elevator Sherman gets in Randy doesn’t

SHERMAN
The answer is no

RANDY

SHERMAN
Since when have we been paying you
to have feelings

And the elevator door shuts in Randy’s face

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN NIGHT

Randy and Pam are at the table eating dinner The atmosphere
is heavy Randy isn’t fully present

PAM
Are you okay

RANDY
Fine I’m fine

PAM
Coz it’s like you’re never here
anymore Ever since you went on
that trip to Austria it feels as if
a part of you never came back

He looks at her He knows she’s right But he doesn’t have an
answer Pam gets up and starts clearing the dishes from the
table

PAM (CONTD)
And I’m getting so tired of it
Randy

He walks up to her puts his arms around her tries to kiss
her But she semi-playfully pushes him away and he knows he’s
testing her patience in a way he never has before

RANDY
I’m sorry

EXT LA STREET DUSK

And at dawn with a newly discovered grit Randy is jogging
And even as he jogs the mental wheels are turning But he’s

Randy says nothing waits for Sherman to elaborate

SHERMAN (CONTD)
I humoured you Let him go to
Europe I thought let him flex his
muscles God knows I suppose there
was a small part of me that hoped
you were onto something

RANDY
I think I am sir

SHERMAN
Youre not Randy There isn’t a
case There’s no enforcement
mechanism between the US and
Austria Unless you think the US
Marshals will show up in Vienna
with a warrant

RANDY
Just one more go sir

SHERMAN
No more goes I need you here now
No more extra-curricular stuff No
more Klimts

And he goes back to his work Randy just stands there But
there’s a reckless look on his face
EXT FEDERAL BUILDING DAY

Randy runs into the Los Angeles Federal Building fuelled by
an urgent purpose

INT FEDERAL BUILDING DAY

Randy walks up to a Court House employee who is sitting
behind the filing window

RANDY
Hi there I’d like to file a law
suit against the Austrian
government I’ve filled in the
summons and here’s the complaint

COURT HOUSE EMPLOYEE
That’1l cost you a hundred and
sixty five dollars

He hands her the documents and a cheque
COURT HOUSE EMPLOYEE (CONTD)

I wanna go to Austria one day with
my daughter She loves kangaroos

EXT MARIAS FRONT YARD DAY

Maria is kneeling down in her garden planting seeds when
suddenly Randy appears in front of her full of purpose and
short of breath

RANDY
Maria Can you come with me please
I want you to witness something

INT THE AUSTRIAN CONSULATE DAY

And now they’re in the reception of the consulate and Randy
makes a bee-line for the receptionist Maria follows and
watches the whole scene with growing bewilderment

RANDY
Is Consul Brandstetter around

CONSULATE RECEPTIONIST
I’m afraid not sir

RANDY
Tell him Mrs Altmann and Randy
Schoenberg dropped by I think he
may have heard of us

CONSULATE RECEPTIONIST
Okay

Maria tries to pull him aside

MARIA
What do we want with the Austrian
Consul

Randy turns back to the receptionist

RANDY
Please inform him we’re just
dropping off a summons and
complaint We’re taking the
Austrian Government to court

He takes an envelope out of his jacket pocket hands it to
her Maria is flabbergasted

RANDY (CONTD)
Have a nice day

And he makes his way to the exit with Maria at his heels

EXT PARKING LOT DAY

On the open top floor of a car-park with the LA skyline in
the distance Randy walks briskly with purpose towards the
car Maria is a few feet behind him

MARIA
Can you slow down a little and tell
me what’s going on here

RANDY
We’re taking them to Court Maria

MARIA
You can’t do this Randy just going
ahead like a mad steam-roller

RANDY
Cant I

MARIA
Stop walking so fast I can’t keep
up with you

He stops at her admonishment and she catches up

RANDY
I’m sorry

MARIA
I told you I have no intention of
suing them I’ve had enough
excitement I have returned to my
quiet life and I have begun to find
some peace again

RANDY
Say that again with conviction

And she snaps

MARTA
Oh don’t be so stupid

And she pulls herself together takes a second

MARIA (CONTD)
Besides you don’t have the time to
do this You have a full time job
remember You have a family to
support

And Randy’s expression says it all Maria gets it He’s quit

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY

Randy approaches Pam at the bottom of the garden out of
earshot of Dora who is playing with some toys in the
distance Randy drops his atom bomb

RANDY
I quit

Pam is incredulous in utter shock It hasn’t sunk in

PAM
What do you mean you quit

RANDY
My job I quit my job I quit I
quit I quit

Pam makes a noise of desperation - a sound of utter despair
and rage - and turns away storms into the house

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN DAY

She bursts into the kitchen and rockets through it on her
way to the bathroom with Randy in close pursuit

RANDY
I spoke to my Dad he said he can
lend us some cash to keep us going
for six months

PAM
Great now we owe your parents
money too Three hundred thousand
dollars of debt isn’t enough

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ HALLWAY DAY
And Pam reaches the bathroom door turns on him

PAM
I’m sick of it Randy I’m sick of
you gambling with our lives

And she slams the door in his face Randy takes a deep
breath leans against the door attempts a confession speaks
quietly from the heart

RANDY
I’m sorryII’m so sorry You’re
right - what you said the other
night - a part of me never did come
back Something happened out there
Pam I don’t know what it is but I
can’t let it go I think it’s
important But I also know that I
can’t do it without you Not for a
single day not for an hour

There’s a beat and the door opens She’s been crying but you
can tell his words have already softened her And then she
too drops a bomb

PAM
I’m pregnant I was going to tell
you over dinner

It hits him like a train but he does his best to cover

RANDY
Wow Okay Wow That’s - I mean
that’sokay We’ll manage You’1l
see We’ll manage

He steps forward and puts his arms around her For a second
she resists then lets him And in that moment they are both
aware that their lives are entering unknown territory

INTEXT RANDYS CAR DAY

An early Californian morning just after dawn and Randy is
driving Maria to the District Court They are both smartly
dressed for a day in Court Maria is holding a cup of coffee
and a chocolate donut

RANDY
They’ve hired Stan Gould from
Heimann Rose a hot-shot Jewish

law firm

MARTA
Nice of them to give jobs to Jewish
boys

RANDY

They’re trying to dismiss the case
on procedural grounds

MARTA
In the hope that I will die before
we have a trial But I will do them
the favour of staying alive

RANDY
Staying alive would be an
advantage

MARIA
Now hurry up because the
chocolate on your donut is melting

INT COURTROOM THE DISTRICT COURT

In the courtroom Randy and Maria are greeted by STAN GOULD
and Toman Gould is an impressive looking lawyer whose whole
demeanour breathes with quiet understated confidence Randy
has just finished his donut there is a tiny smidgen of
chocolate on his nose

RANDY
Mr Gould

GOULD
Mr Schoenberg Mrs Altmann

RANDY
Lovely of you to come all the way
from Austria Dr Toman We’re
flattered

TOMAN
I’ve always wanted to visit
Disneyland Two birds with one
stone as they say

MARTA
I hope we make your visit
worthwhile

TOMAN
Mrs Altmann may I say you are
looking even younger than you did
in Vienna

MARTA
Thank you Dr Toman This morning
I’m feeling as if I have another
fifty years in front of me

Toman looks confused at the private joke between Maria and
Randy

COURT OFFICIAL
All rise

JUDGE FLORENCE COOPER enters She is an impressive woman with
great authority but not intimidating Maria takes a small
handkerchief out of her hand-bag and dabs the chocolate off
Randy’s nose

INT COURTROOM THE DISTRICT COURT DAY

The court case Judge Cooper sits at the bench Randy and
Maria on one side Gould and Toman on the other The session
is in full swing

GOULD
Your Honour the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act was passed in 1976
a good thirty eight years after the
events in question It seems to me
obvious that the FSIA rulings can
not be applied retroactively and I
am bewildered that Mrs Altmann’s
counsel has not advised her of this
fact It would have saved her a
great deal of inconvenience and an
equal amount of false hope

Suddenly Maria puts her hand up and speaks

MARTA
It really isn’t much of an
inconvenience If I wasn’t here
Id either be at my shop or at home
watching ‘Days of Our Lives’

Randy is mortified at her interruption the others can’t
quite believe it Judge Cooper steps in

JUDGE COOPER
I’m glad to hear that Mrs
Altmann But from now on would you
mind speaking only when you are
asked There are certain procedures
which need to be adhered to ina
court-room

And Maria smiles apologetically Randy is still reeling

INT COURTROOM THE DISTRICT COURT DAY
And now Randy is giving his response

RANDY
Your Honour MrGould is right to
point out that the FSIA was enacted
in 1976 but he is mistaken in his
theory that it can not be applied
retroactively

He lifts some documents hands them to a COURT MARSHALL The
Court Marshall hands them over to Judge Cooper who scans
them Meanwhile Randy passes copies of them to the
opposition

RANDY (CONTD)
Despite the fact that actions
accruing before 1976 are rarer
they very much exist these are
just three examples of them

JUDGE COOPER
Thank you Mr Schoenberg I’m sure
these will prove to be a riveting
read Let’s adjourn for ten
minutes

And Randy smiles at her sarcasm

INT COURTROOM THE DISTRICT COURT DAY
Gould again still confident but a little less so

GOULD
This is a domestic matter for
Austria Anything else would be a
violation of its national
sovereignty After all there is a
forum available for Mrs Altmann to
pursue her case in Austria without
resorting to the use of American
courts and American tax-payer’s
money

INT COURTROOM THE DISTRICT COURT DAY
Randy is becoming more confident as he goes on

RANDY
Your Honour I applaud Mr Gould’s
concern for the American tax-payer
but taking the defendant to court
in Austria would require her to be
a multi-milionairess It is not an
option In a matter of fact your
Honour we have exhausted all other
options If we hadn’t we wouldn’t
be standing before you today
INT COURTROOM THE DISTRICT COURT DAY
And JUDGE COOPER gives her verdict from the bench

JUDGE COOPER
The plaintiff has adequately proved
that the FSIA can apply to pre 1976
events Also due to prohibitive
costs this Court has decided that
Austria provides an inadequate
forum for resolution of plaintiffs
claims

GOULD
Your Honour

JUDGE COOPER
Defendant’s Motion to dismiss is
denied

COURT OFFICIAL
All rise

People stand as Judge Cooper exits Randy whispers

RANDY
First hurdle down

MARIA
I’ve always thought there should be
More women judges

INT COURTROOM THE DISTRICT COURT DAY
Randy approaches Toman as he is about to leave the

RANDY
Dr Toman

TOMAN
Congratulations Mr Schoenberg An
unexpected outcome which no doubt
has delighted you

RANDY
You’re a busy man who can’t be that
keen on spending the good part of
his life traipsing through the US
Court system I would urge you to
consider mediation

TOMAN
There will be no mediation Mr
Schoenberg You have been
exceptionally lucky today that is
all Good-day to you

to Maria

courtroom

Maria who’s been over-hearing the conversation waves at

Toman

MARTA
Enjoy Disneyland

And Toman walks away

INT MARIA’S LIVING ROOM DAY

Maria is having her hair done at home EIGHT MONTHS have
passed and she is looking a little more frail A HAIRDRESSER
a middle aged woman has just finished and is showing her the
back of her head with a portable mirror

MARIA
Appeal appeal appeal The
Austrians keep appealing and
they’re denied every time

HAIRDRESSER
They don’t give up easily that
much you have in common

MARIA
So now we’re going all the way to
the Supreme Court Which is why I
need you to make me look like a
million dollars

The phone rings and she leans over and answers it

MARIA (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
Hello Randy what’s happened to
you I’m getting my hair done
Washington style

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY

Randy is on the wireless phone in the garden when Pam
approaches him She is very noticeably pregnant

RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
Okay that’s fine so I’1ll see you
at the airport

And he switches it off She’s picked up that he’s troubled by
something

PAM
What’s wrong

RANDY
I chickened out I don’t have the
heart to tell her

PAM
Tell her what

RANDY
Our own Government has filed a
brief in Austria’s favour Can you
believe that

PAM
Why

RANDY
The Iraq war

PAM
They need as many friends as they
can get

RANDY

They don’t want to start
antagonising their allies

PAM
So now youre fighting the
Americans as well

RANDY
Feels like I’m fighting the whole
damn world

And Pam looks at him Something in her can’t help admiring
him And that same thing starts to change her She doesn’t
want to be one of the people he’s fighting anymore

PAM
My money’s on you

EXT BURTON WAY LA DAY

In the afternoon sunshine Maria crosses the street on her
way to The Four Seasons Hotel

INT FOUR SEASONS HOTEL CAFE DAY

Maria is in the cafe of The Four Seasons being walked to a
table by a waitress At the table sits RONALD LAUDER a man
who exudes elegance and wealth He stands

LAUDER
Mrs Altmann I’m Ronald Lauder

MARIA
The son of Estee I’ve always loved
your mother’s cosmetics Her lip-
stick is my favourite

INT FOUR SEASONS HOTEL CAFE DAY

A few minutes later Maria and Lauder are having tea Lauder
talking with focussed intensity

LAUDER
The art works stolen by the Nazis
are the last prisoners of World War
Two And Adele is their queen

MARIA
My aunt would be flattered

LAUDER
I was a young man when I first saw
the portrait and I instantly fell
in love

MARIA
She has that effect on people

LAUDER
Which is why I want her for the
Neue Galerie in New York I will
put my offer in writing but have no
doubt it will be substantial

MARTA
We are jumping the gun a little
Mr Lauder

LAUDER
One needs to do what one can to
make a favourable outcome as likely
as possible Which brings me to
young Mr Schoenberg He’s been a
formidable ally

MARIA
And continues to be one

LAUDER
But he’s not cut out for the
Supreme Court Mrs Altmann A
little like sending a school-boy
onto the front line

MARIA
You think so

LAUDER
I’m willing to pay for you to have
the finest representation from this
point on The man I have in mind
is to art restitution what Einstein
is to relativity He’s done his
homework on your case and I’m ready
to parachute him in Can I ask him
to call you

MARIA
You can ask him to take a hike

Lauder is flummoxed
MARIA (CONTD)
I’m sticking with my school-boy
Mr Lauder And that’s final
INT THE SCHOENBERG’S BEDROOM NIGHT
Randy is lying in bed surrounded by pages and pages of work

documents rehearsing for his imminent appearance at the
Supreme Court He practices out loud

RANDY
Your Honours this repeated attempt
by the defence to have the case
dismissed

Pam appears at the door in her nightie Considering what
she’s about to say her attitude is quite relaxed

PAM
Randy We need to drop Dora off at
your mother’s and get to the
hospital

RANDY
You think I should go deeper with
the voice

PAM
Honey My water broke

He looks at her taking on what she’s just said In shock He
jumps up

RANDY
Okay Stay calm stay calm

But she is calm he’s the one freaking out as he hurriedly
dresses Pam calmly takes an overnight bag out places it on
the bed and starts putting clothes into it

PAM
Randy I’m fine

RANDY
Youre having a baby

PAM
I’m aware of that

RANDY
I’1ll get the car Do you need to
sit Do you need a glass of water

PAM
Randy relax I’ve done this
before I’1ll be okay

She takes some of his ties out throws them on the bed

PAM (CONTD)
Which tie are you going to wear to
the Supreme Court

RANDY
Are you sure that’s important right
now

She chucks him a slightly old-fashioned green one
PAM

Wear the one your Dad got you for
good luck With the blue shirt

And then she sits on the bed signals for him to do sit next
to her He does

PAM (CONT’D)
You need to take me to the hospital
and then you need to go to
Washington You need to do it for
all of us

RANDY
Are you sure that’s what you want

PAM
Listen to me I got it wrong
Whatever I said I want you to know
I’m with you now And if it doesn’t
work out we’ll manage Either way
well be okay You’re doing the
right thing and I love you

She touches his face smiles warmly And he knows that she
now understands something of why he had to take on the case
Then suddenly movement She flinches looks down

PAM (CONTD)
He’s getting twitchy

RANDY

We need to go I’m not good at the
whole midwife thing

EXT WASHINGTON DAY

Washington in the winter sun Capitol Hill the White House
The Supreme Court

INT WASHINGTON HOTEL DAY

Maria is sitting on the edge of the bed coaching Randy who
stands before her

MARTA
Do it again without the arms

Randy starts speaking with his arms glued to his side

RANDY
Mr Chief Justice and may it please
the Court

MARTA

Now you look like a pillar

RANDY
This is great for my confidence

MARIA
Move them but not like before
Somewhere between a windmill and a
pillar

RANDY
Maria this really isn’t helping I
need to go through the briefs

MARIA
Alright Ill leave you alone now

She gets up and makes her way towards the door Then turns to
him

MARIA (CONTD)
Speak from the heart Randy and
youll be fine

RANDY
Will I

And his question hovers in the air Suddenly they’re both
aware that they might be well out of their depth

EXT THE SUPREME COURT DAY

In the morning sunshine the Supreme Court stands proud

INT THE SUPREME COURT DAY

And in the Court everybody is settling down for the session
to begin Randy on the one side with Maria Gould Toman and
FRANKS (representing the US Government) on the other Maria

leans over to Randy again offers him a cough-sweet

MARIA
Have a cough drop They are cherry
flavoured

Randy takes it but he is a nervous wreck as he shuffles
through his documents Maria leans further in puts her hand
on his arm

MARIA (CONTD)
You know my dear even if we go no
further we made it to the Supreme
Court Who’d have thought it A
little Austrian girl like me

INT ELLIS ISLAND DETENTION WARD DAY 1938

On a hot July day with a view of New York seen through a
window a few poorly dressed people mill around their bunks
in a dormitory of a tenement for newly-arrived refugees One
man is tuning an accordion some children are looking at a
comic book a woman sits on the edge of her bed staring
ahead In amongst them lying on a bunk are Maria and
Fritz They sit on the bed with brochures promoting
California spread out before them They are sharing a bottle
of cheap wine and trying to stay cheerful in this new
unknown country

YOUNG MARIA
Can you please show me the way to
the wash-room sir

FRITZ
Now say it again but with an
American accent If you say it like
that nobody will understand you

YOUNG MARTA
You can talk You sound like a
silly Frankfurter

FRITZ
I am a man not a sausage

Just then as they giggle the door opens and a WARDEN walks
in someone who works at the tenement He is holding a
telegram

WARDEN
Maria Altmann Which one of you is
Maria Altmann

YOUNG MARIA
I am

Maria jumps off the bed and runs up to the man who hands her
the telegram then walks out a little gruffly Maria opens
it reads it And we know that whatever it is she is reading
has suddenly shaken her to the very core She walks back to
the bunk almost falling on to it as her legs buckle Fritz
puts his hand on hers

FRITZ FRITZ (CONT’D)

What is it Was ist los
YOUNG MARIA YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)

It’s from my sister She’s Es ist von meiner schwester
waiting for us in California Sie wartet auf uns in
But she’s had news from Kalifornien Aber sie hat
Vienna Nachrichten aus Wien

FRITZ FRITZ (CONTD)
Your parents Deine Eltern

She collapses into his arms and weeps

INT THE SUPREME COURT DAY

The session has begun CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST speaks - he is
an intimidating authoritative presence
CJ REHNQUIST
Well hear argument next in 03-13
the Republic of Austria v Maria
Altmann MrGould

GOULD
Mr Chief Justice and may it please
the Court I’1ll keep my argument
succinct sir this is a domestic
matter for Austria It has no place
in the American Courts

CJ REHNQUIST
Mr Franks representing the United
States Government your opening
statement please

Franks is talking now and his age and experience emanate
his every pore

FRANKS
Mr Chief Justice if this law were
to be applied retroactively it
could open claims brought against a
number of foreign states which
would further complicate our
international relations

CJ REHNQUIST
Give me an example

FRANKS
Well there are currently cases
pending against countries such as
Japan and France with which

CJ REHNQUIST
So what you’re saying is that Mrs
Altmann shouldn’t try and reclaim
her paintings because it might
affect our relations with Japan

FRANKS
That could be a possible outcome
Your Honour

CJ REHNQUIST
Mrs Altmann it seems that if your
case goes forward world diplomacy
will collapse and you will be
solely responsible

Subdued laughter from the audience

INT THE SUPREME COURT DAY

Randy stands for his big moment He is very nervous very
stiff

from

RANDY
Mr Chief Justice and may it please
the Court We believe that applying
the FSIA is not impermissibly
retroactive

Chief Justice Rehnquist starts to ask him a question Randy
is like a bunny in the headlights of a car

CJ REHNQUIST
Why isn’t it just as easy to say
that it does operate retroactively
because the question is when should
it exercise jurisdiction for a
particular purpose

Randy is completely lost

RANDY
I’m sorry I didn’t understand the
question

The embarrassment is palpable Maria looks at the floor
Toman can’t help but let out a little smirk

CJ REHNQUIST
I don’t think I did either

And the tension is burst Everyone laughs and Randy sighs
with relief

CJ REHNQUIST (CONTD)
Did anyone

And more laughter

INT THE SUPREME COURT DAY
We watch him grow in confidence and stature with every word

RANDY
Were very sensitive to the
Government’s concerns Mr Chief
Justice the can of worms argument
But each country is different and
poses different conditions Unlike
say Cuba in Austria’s case there’s
a treaty so there’s no dispute as
to what type of law could apply We
recommend opening the can but
extracting our one little worm with
a pair of tweezers And then
closing it shut again

And laughter from the audience

RANDY (CONTD)
The defendants have continuously
tried to frustrate our attempts
raising every possible objection
and threatening an Armageddon in
international relations
(MORE)

RANDY (CONT’D)
But let’s put things into
perspective here this is a case
about one woman wanting back what
is rightfully hers Mrs Altmann
came to America as a young woman in
search of peace Let’s give her
justice too

Maria looks up at Randy and her eyes are beaming with pride

INT AN ANTEROOM THE SUPREME COURT DAY

In a room just outside the courtroom Maria and Randy find
themselves in the middle of a media scrum A REPORTER places
a mike under Maria

REPORTER
Mrs Altmann were you surprised
that the US Government supported
the Austrians in trying to get the
case dismissed

MARIA
Everybody wants me to hurry up and
die why not the Americans as well

The journalists laugh Randy is standing at the side when he
is approached by another COURT REPORTER

COURT REPORTER
David Pike Court Reporter You
were impressive in there no doubt

RANDY
Why thank you Randy Schoenberg

He gives him his card

COURT REPORTER
Takes about three months for the
verdict to come though But there’s
no way you’re gonna win

RANDY
Okay

COURT REPORTER
I’ve been doing this job for thirty-
four years and I’m always right
It’s in their body language

RANDY
Well thank you very much That’s a
cheerful way to end the day

COURT REPORTER
No problem

And he ambles off leaving Randy dumb-struck to digest what
he’s just heard

INT THE SCHOENBERG’S BEDROOM DAY

Randy rushes into the bedroom with a ridiculously large
bouquet of flowers And then he sees them Pam in bed
holding their new baby son

PAM
Hey Say hi to your son

RANDY
Hi Nathan

And he is overwhelmed

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY
Superimposed caption THREE MONTHS LATER

Maria Pam and Randy are sitting on the lawn - Pam is holding
Nathan in her arms while Dora runs laughing around Maria
Dora is looking older than when we last saw her she’s a real
toddler

MARIA
She takes after her father Can’t
sit still for a moment

RANDY
Are you calling me hyper-active

MARIA
Like you have spiders crawling in
your underwear all the time

Randy keeps looking at his watch
PAM
Sweetie will you stop looking at

your watch every two minutes

MARTA
You’re making us all nervous

RANDY
They said we should hear by noon

The phone rings Randy runs indoors to answer it Maria and
Pam look at each other and smile at the speed with which he’s
run into the house

INT THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN DAY

He answers the phone Through the window we can see Pam and
Maria playing with the kids though obviously on tenterhooks
themselves

RANDY
Hello

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN DAY

Randy comes out walks up to where Maria and Pam are sitting
He looks downcast as if the news is bad

MARIA
I told you not to get excited but
you didn’t listen to me

RANDY
Bad news I’m afraid You can’t give
up yet The fight goes on

MARIA
What are you talking about

RANDY
The Supreme Court has ruled in our
favour We can take the Austrians
to trial Maria

Pam jumps up and hugs him

PAM
Oh my God Randy you did it

Maria too stands up walks to him takes his face in her
hands

MARIA
From the first moment I saw you I
knew you were the right man for the
job That’s why I ignored all the
terrible bits

And she plants a big smacker on his cheek Randy smiles but
is holding back a little bit almost as if he can’t quite
allow himself to feel the joy of the moment

EXT THE SCHOENBERGS’ DRIVEWAY DAY

And in the evening light Randy and Pam are waving at Maria
as she is driven away in a taxi Randy is holding Nathan Pam
is holding Dora But Pam has picked something up in Randy’s
behaviour

PAM
Are you okay I thought this was
the outcome you wanted

RANDY
Just something I’ve been thinking
over that kind of puts a damper on
the celebrations

She looks at him not understanding

RANDY (CONTD)
Sure we can take them to court
But they’1ll find other ways to
stretch it out Could take a few
more years She might not live to
see the outcome

(MORE)

RANDY (CONTD)

And we can’t afford it Four more
months and the bailiff’s at the
door

PAM
Weve come so far there’s no way
we can stop now I’m frightened
but I’m with you

And he kisses her - in acknowledgement of how far she’s
travelled And then in that moment an idea comes to him

RANDY
There’s only one more thing we
could try

And then Pam too well-versed in the case gets it
PAM
Mediation
INT BOARDROOM DAY
In a slick board-room in Los Angeles Randy and Maria sit on
the one side of the table Toman on the other And between

them sits Professor DIETER BINDER an elderly Austrian
historian who is the mediator

BINDER
Welcome

RANDY
Funny how things turn out in the
end

TOMAN

We really want to avoid going to
trial here in America

MARTA
You’ve done an effective job
proving that Dr Toman

TOMAN
So we’re happy to consider other
options Austria is all ears

MARIA
How very refreshing

RANDY
Despite my protestations my client
is prepared to meet you half way

MARTA
As a gesture of reconciliation I am
willing to allow the paintings to
remain in the Belvedere All you
have to do is admit that you took
them illegally
RANDY
And then come to an agreement with
us on the question of compensation

TOMAN
I’m afraid we’re not budging and
that is final We will not be
paying for something we believe is
ours and we will fight you to the
death before we concede on this

Another impasse Binder steps in

BINDER
I’m assuming you all want this to
be over so let’s study the other
options we have

Randy talks but he is already nervous at how his next words

will be taken my Maria

RANDY
Arbitration in Vienna

MARIA
Randy

RANDY

We chose one of the arbitrators
you choose another The third is
neutral

Toman can hardly believe his ears and has trouble
his joy

TOMAN
Now you are talking sense This
sounds like a reasonable idea

But Maria is in shock
MARIA

Randy can I speak to you in
private for a moment

And from her tone Randy knows she’s having none of it

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE BOARDROOM DAY

concealing

Maria and Randy are standing outside the boardroom Through
the glass wall we can see Toman and Binder Maria is fierce
and adamant Randy was prepared for this and is doing his

best to reassure her

MARIA
Have you lost your mind

RANDY
I want to see you getting your
paintings back Maria I’d like you
to get them before

MARTA
Before I die is what you mean

RANDY
Well frankly yes

MARIA
And you’re crazy enough to think
that some arbitration in Vienna
will vote in our favour

RANDY
I honestly don’t think we have a
choice

MARIA

But that means we have to go back
to Austria

Randy starts to lose his patience with her

RANDY
Maria Listen to me I can’t sit
here arguing with you okay I’m
doing what I think is best You
need to just be quiet for once and
trust me

MARTA
No Randy I will not be quiet I’m
sorry Enough is enough

And she’s already opened the door to the boardroom

INT BOARDROOM DAY

She strides up to where her handbag is picks it up turns
Toman and speaks dignified and strident in equal measure

MARIA

Congratulations Dr Toman Your

tactics have succeeded I am not

playing this game anymore

Goodbye gentlemen
And she sweeps out of the boardroom leaving Binder
speechless Toman can’t help but release a tiny look of
satisfaction
INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE BOARDROOM DAY

And she sweeps by Randy not stopping for a second

EXT MARIAS FRONT YARD DAY

Randy drives up to Maria’s bungalow pulls over gets out

to

and runs towards the front door He is worked up fuming He
rings the doorbell and a couple of seconds later Maria opens

the door but doesn’t let him in

RANDY
Nice one Maria Thank you

MARIA
I’m not in the mood I don’t want
to talk to you

RANDY
The feeling is mutual but we don’t
have the choice right now

She tries to close the door he puts his foot in it and
blocks it

INT MARIA’S HALLWAY DAY

Exasperated Maria opens the door walks into the hallway
Randy follows her into the house She turns on him And when
she speaks it is with a quiet steel in her voice She’s made
her mind up

MARIA
It’s over Randy We made a
mistake

RANDY

What’s over What are you saying

MARTA
I’m saying that we have to accept
defeat and return to what’s left of
our lives

RANDY
Are you insane

MARIA
I’m saying that I’m tired and that
they can keep the paintings I’m
saying Randy that as of this
moment I no longer need your
services

Randy can not believe what he’s hearing And when he erupts
Maria is not prepared for the full force of it

RANDY
Are you kidding me I have given
everything I have I am HALF A
MILLION DOLLARS in debt and my wife
and I aremy children everything
I fucking care about in this
worldand you have the
nerveeverything I’ve done I’ve
done to get those goddamn paintings
back for youI wish you’d never
asked me and you have the nerve
to come to me and say that it’s all
over

And he stops and Maria is standing there looking at him
shaken by his rage And softening he speaks quietly

RANDY (CONTD)
We’ve come so farjust hang in
there

MARTA
The Austrians will never let go
And I won’t be humiliated again Go
back to Vienna if you have to But
this time I’m not coming back with
you You’re on your own Randy

And the two of them stand silently opposite each other in the
hallway of her small house shaken by their emotions

EXT VIENNA NIGHT

Montage of Vienna at night

EXT VIENNA STREET NIGHT

Randy and Hubertus are walking down a street in the old part
of town

HUBERTUS
The man you chose for the
arbitration panel is a safe bet
but I’m a little worried about the
other two I can’t lie The one
chosen by the Austrian State is a
strict traditionalist I can’t see
him deciding in your favour And as
for the thirdwellit’s a gamble

RANDY
Here’s hoping

HUBERTUS
But I never thought you’d come
back And personally I need to be
honest - I don’t think it’s the
right decision You are betting on
Austria having changed

And Hubertus’ eyes suggest that it might be a bet too far
They pass by a small concert hall A poster catches Randy’s
eye there’s an Arnold Schoenberg concert starting in twenty
minutes He looks at Hubertus and they smile at the
coincidence Randy checks his watch and runs to the box
office gives his credit card to the female BOX OFFICE
EMPLOYEE who takes it

RANDY
Two tickets please

BOX OFFICE EMPLOYEE
It starts in two minutes

And then she notices the name on the card

BOX OFFICE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
You have the same name as the
composer

Hubertus looks at Randy and they smile to each other

HUBERTUS
What a coincidence

INT CONCERT HALL NIGHT

Randy and Hubertus sit in the darkened concert hall Randy
listens proudly to his grandfather’s music watching the
orchestra playing and the crowd appreciating it And
something is inspired in him

INT THE ARBITRATION ROOM DAY

The arbitration A large room in a Government building in
Vienna At a long table sit the three arbitrators In the
room there is also a sizeable audience which includes
Hubertus Elizabeth Gehrer Wran and Toman Randy stands near
the panel One of the arbitrators stands

ARBITRATOR
The Austrian Government has
provided its case in writing for
our perusal Mr Schoenberg you
too were offered the opportunity to
do so but you have opted to present
the introductory points of your
argument orally as well is that
correct

RANDY
I have yes

ARBITRATOR
The floor is yours

RANDY
Thank you sir

Randy stands in the centre of the room and it feels like the
whole of Austria is his audience He clears his throat takes
a deep breath but looks uncertain - almost as if he can’t do
it He begins but his tone lacks confidence it wavers

RANDY (CONTD)
Ladies and gentlemen I’m happy to
be standing before you today for
two reasons Firstly like my
opponents in this case I always
believed that this was a domestic
matter for Austria that needed to
be decided within her borders

Suddenly he’s interrupted a door opens at the back of the
room His eyes are drawn to it It’s Maria She’s come after
all She walks up to the front of the room and sits Randy
comes to her leans in and they whisper to each other

RANDY (CONT’D)
I wasn’t expecting to see you here

MARIA
The first time I came back for
myself This time I came back for
you Now stand up straight

He looks at her takes strength from her words straightens
up and resumes his opening speech - she has moved and
inspired him He takes a deep breath and he looks two inches
taller And the speech is now driven by a new confidence

RANDY

And the second reason I’m happy to
be in Vienna today is because my
client Mrs Altmann and I are both
Austrians

Some of the audience seem surprised but Maria knows what he
means

RANDY (CONTD)
Oh don’t get me wrong we’re very
much Americans too But our
families and the roots we share are
situated in the culture of this
very city

INT CONCERT HALL VIENNA NIGHT

And we see a flashback to the night before and Randy
observing the audience as they listen to his grandfathers
music

INT KLIMT’S STUDIO DAY

And now we see Adele being painted by Klimt once more as he
puts the final touches to the great painting

RANDY (VO)
And somewhere in the heart of this
world stands the woman whose
portrait both sides are fighting
for Adele Bloch-Bauer

INT THE ARBITRATION ROOM DAY

Randy in full flow now the confident experienced lawyer he
has become

RANDY
During my visits to this country I
have discerned that there are two
Austrias the one that opposes
restitution to the victims of
Nazism and another that recognises
the injustice committed against
Austria’s Jewish population and
seeks to rectify it

We watch Dr Toman Elizabeth Gehrer and Rudolf Wran
responding to what he is saying and then we land on Hubertus
the two Austrias

RANDY (CONTD)
As I hope I demonstrate in my
written arguments the law favours
restitution

And now during these next few scenes we watch a flashing
montage of the journey of the painting and the way it ended
up in the Belvedere --

EXT VIENNA DAY

The Anchluss The Viennese crowds greet the Nazis in
celebration women throwing flowers to welcome them

RANDY (VO)
A string of events and misdeeds
point to the incontestible fact
that the paintings in question
reached the Belvedere Gallery and
remained there for over half a
century in a manner that was both
dishonest and illegal And that
Adele’s will itself was not legally
binding

INT LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE DAY

The auction at Elizabethstrasse

EXT ELIZABETHSTRASSE DAY

The painting of Adele being loaded onto a truck

INT THE BELVEDERE DAY

And the painting coming to hang on the wall of the Belvedere
under Grimshitz’s supervision

INT THE ARBITRATION ROOM DAY

And as Randy reaches the conclusion he slows his tempo a
little to make sure these last few words really land

RANDY
In its own way Ladies and Gentlemen
this is a moment of history a
moment in which the past is asking
something of the present Many
years ago (in this very city)
just beyond these walls terrible
things happened People dehumanised
other people - they persecuted
them sent many to their deaths
and decimated whole families
breaking them apart forever And
they stole from them - properties
livelihoods and the objects that
were most precious to them

(MORE)

RANDY (CONTD)
Amongst those people were the Bloch-
Bauers the family of a very dear
friend of mine So now I am asking
you - as Austrians - as human
beings - to recognise that wrong
(Not just for Maria Altmann but for
Austria) I am asking you today to
look at the past as I have and to
restore what has been taken away

And his eyes meet Maria’s And by articulating these last
words he understands that he too in some profound way has
been restored And it is clear that his words have resonated
with his audience especially on the faces of Toman and Wran

EXT THE PRATER PARK DAY

Maria Randy and Hubertus are walking in the shade of the
Ferris Wheel Randy is checking his phone

RANDY
They said they should announce the
verdict by four

HUBERTUS
One thing is for sure This country
is about to decide what it really
is

They approach a bench and sit down on it

HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
When I was a child my father used
to bring me here on Sundays

MARIA
For waffles and ice-cream eh

HUBERTUS
And a ride on the ferris wheel

And he knows that now is the moment to confide their
friendship has earned it

HUBERTUS (CONTD)
He was an impressive man tall and
domineering with his hair always
combed back Handsome I suppose
As a small boy I looked up to him
worshipped him

MARIA
You wanted to grow up to be like
him

HUBERTUS

When I was fifteen I discovered
that he had been a Nazi Maria A
passionate follower of the Third
Reich

His words are coming out with great difficulty almost as if
he hasn’t spoken them before
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
All my life I’ve been trying to
make up for the sins of the father
Every day asking myself how he
could be the person he was And
every day trying to move away from
him

He turns to look at Maria and Randy

HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
How’s that for a motive Randy

RANDY
It’s pretty damn good

Randy smiles guiltily at the memory of his initial scepticism
of Hubertus Maria leans over and takes Hubertus’ hand

MARIA
You are a fine man Hubertus A
good man

Then Randy’s phone goes a text He looks at it

RANDY
Decision time

INT THE ARBITRATION ROOM DAY

The room is packed to the rafters A tense atmosphere - the
moment everyone has been waiting for Maria Randy and
Hubertus are squeezed in and nearby are Wran Toman and
Gehrer There is also a large media contingent The main
arbitrator stands and there is a hushed silence

ARBITRATOR
We the arbitrators have now
studied both sides of this complex
case Trying to keep an open mind
as we examined the evidence we have
reached our final verdict

He walks over to the other arbitrators One of them hands him
an envelope which he slowly opens He puts on his glasses
and reads from it

ARBITRATOR (CONTD)

Our decision today is that the
portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer and
the other Klimt paintings in
question should be returned to her
niece Maria Altmann

A huge wave of emotion sweeps across the room and on the
faces of all the audience we see a myriad of responses
Hubertus is profoundly moved and buries his face in his
hands Randy squeezes Maria’s hand who seems overwhelmed
Cheers clash with sounds of consternation Wran and Gehrer
make a quick exit
INT HALL OUTSIDE ARBITRATION ROOM DAY

In the excited crowd Randy Maria and Hubertus embrace and
congratulate each other

HUBERTUS
For the first time in a long while
I am proud to call myself an
Austrian

MARIA
You should be

RANDY
The press are waiting outside
Maria They want a statement How
do I look

MARTA
Sexy and victorious And how do I
look

RANDY
Sexy and victorious

Suddenly out of nowhere Toman approaches Maria

TOMAN
Mrs Altmann may I have a word
MARIA
Dr Toman
They go to one side
TOMAN

I am defeated But I will ask you -
beg you entreat you - not to let
these paintings leave their
motherland Let us come to an
arrangement I am sure we can make
a generous offer

MARTA
It makes me sad too that they will
not stay in Adele’s country But
Dr Toman all along I have tried to
negotiate to keep the dialogue
open And all along you have
thwarted me closed the doors in my
face I am tired Dr Toman and my
aunt is now crossing the Atlantic
to make her home in America like I
once did Excuse me

And she makes a move away from him visibly emotional and
starts to walk down the hall looking for some privacy
Hubertus notices points it out to Randy

HUBERTUS
I think our friend might be needing
a little attention

Randy sees Maria enter a room off the hall and follows But
turns one last time to Hubertus casually throwing his words
over his shoulder as he moves away

RANDY
Have I said that we couldn’t have
done it without you

INT ROOM OFF THE ARBITRATION HALL DAY

Maria has found and entered an empty room off the hall and
closes the door behind her There is a window and she walks
towards it She suddenly looks quite frail takes a few deep
breaths She is overwhelmed And then she remembers the last
time she saw her parents The goodbye --

INT GUSTAV AND THRESE’S BEDROOM DAY 1938

Maria moves into the room and joins Gustav and Therese by the
bed She kneels down takes their hands in hers and the three
of them hold on to each other knowing this may well be the
last time they ever see each other Therese is crying When
Gustav speaks it is with some effort his breathing is
laboured

YOUNG MARIA
Papa Mutti I’m leaving now

GUSTAV
You are doing the right
thing

YOUNG MARIA
But I don’t want to

THERESE
You have to live Maria You
have to move forward into the
future and this place has no
future for you

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Papa Mutti ich gehe jetzt

GUSTAV (CONTD)
Du tust das Richtige

YOUNG MARIA (CONTD)
Aber ich will nicht

THERESE (CONTD)
Du musst leben Maria Du
musst in die Zukunft schauen
und dieser Ort hat fiir dich
keine Zukunft mehr

Gustav clutches her hand and looks deep into her eyes And
when he next speaks he speaks in English to her His accent
is strong but he speaks it beautifully

GUSTAV

English will become your language
and America will be your home

YOUNG MARIA

Yes papa

GUSTAV

We speak English from now on You
listen to me now in the language of

your future

And he manages a little laugh Through tears Maria laughs
too But then still speaking English his tone changes

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
When our family moved to Vienna
Maria they were not rich people
We worked hard we did everything
we could to contribute and to
belong We are proud of what we
have done and we are proud of our
children Nobody can take that away
from us And now as you go I ask
you only one thing mein liebling

YOUNG MARIA
What is it Papa

GUSTAV
Remember us

And father mother and daughter fall into each others’ arms
and embrace for the very last time

Maria stands and walks to the door When she reaches it she
turns back one last time and looks at her mother and father

THERESE THERESE (CONT’D)
Take us with you in your Behalte uns in deinem Herzen
heart and learn to be happy und lerne wieder gliicklich
again zu werden

And Maria goes

INT ROOM OFF THE ARBITRATION ROOM DAY

Randy knocks on the door and tentatively pushes it open
Maria is still standing by the window

RANDY
Maria

MARIA
In a moment Randy

RANDY
Are you alright

He approaches her Fighting a huge surge of emotion she
tries to express herself

MARTA
Thank you my darling thank you
with all my heart for what you’ve
done But foolishly I thought that
it would make everything alright
make it better

He looks inquiringly at her trying to understand And she
breaks
MARIA (CONTD)
Nothing can ever do that Randy I
left them here I left them here
my love

And he opens his arms to embrace her She falls into them
and she weeps

EXT ELIZABETHSTRASSE DAY

Later after all the madness Randy and Maria walk in the
late afternoon sun

RANDY
So now

MARTA
I’ve been thinking of that smart
Mr Lauder I think I want Aunt
Adele to go and live in his little
gallery My only condition is that
she will always be on public
display for everyone to marvel at
After all I think she’s a little
too big for my bungalow

RANDY
You can move house Maria buy
anything you want

MARTA
I’m quite happy where I am thank
you And the money can go to
relatives and good causes I think
it’s what she would have wanted

RANDY
What about you

MARIA
Well I do need a new dish-washer

She winks at him jokingly but there is a sadness in her
voice Suddenly they are approached by a young Austrian
woman Susi

SUSI
Mrs Altmann I just wanted to say
how happy I am that you have got
back the paintings I will miss
seeing them in the Belvedere but
it is the right thing For you and
for Austria

MARIA
Thank you my dear

The young woman smiles and runs off Maria and Randy walk in
silence for a couple of seconds And then quietly Maria
speaks
MARIA (CONTD)

Your grandfather would be proud of
you Without even knowing it you
have become a torchbearer

He looks at her not understanding
MARIA (CONTD)
The one who keeps the memory alive
Randy

RANDY
I didn’t do it on my own

And then a few seconds later Randy looks up They are
outside the Elizabethstrasse house Maria is visibly moved

And on the spur of the moment she makes a decision

MARIA
Give me a moment

She walks up to the entrance of the building and through the
gate

INT ELIZABETHSTRASSE STAIRWELL DAY

Maria walks up the stairs to her former home She pushes it
open

INT THE ENTRANCE HALLWAY ELIZABETHSTRASSE DAY

Inside the offices of the Rail Company look like any other

offices - a little bland A young man who is a RAIL COMPANY
EMPLOYEE walks up to her smiling

RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE
Can I help you (CONT ’D)
Kann Ich Ihnen helfen

MARIA MARIA (CONTD)

I know this house I want to Ich kenne dieses Haus Ich

look around Just a few wiirde mich gern ein wenig

moments umsehen Nur einen
Augenblick

A little baffled he smiles

RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE
Of course (CONT ’D)
Nattirlich

And he goes back to work Maria edges her way forward into
the house And suddenly it starts to change
INT ELIZABETHSTRASSE NIGHT 2002 1930S

Through Maria’s eyes the house magically transforms into
what it used to be a warm family home Music fills the
rooms something rich evocative and moving

As she moves around the house Maria is bedazzled by what she
sees She wanders from room to room and comes across scenes
from a beautiful childhood and a resplendent Austrian past

First in the dining room she sees her mother Therese
arranging flowers in a vase and being helped by Maria and
Luise as children

Then she walks across the hallway to the living room where
Gustav is playing the cello for his family Maria and Luise
now young women and Therese Enraptured they cluster around
him enjoying the music

And then she turns and in another part of the room she sees
herself and Fritz dancing on their wedding night twirling
through the admiring guests She walks through the crowds to
the Adele room and pushes open the door

She enters and is amazed at what she sees The room is
buzzing with people - artists writers Vienna at its best
There is art on the wall and books and clusters of people
in animated discussion She makes her way through the crowd
towards the end of the room Adele sits directly beneath the
Klimt portrait surrounded by Ferdinand and a group of
friends as they argue passionately about politics and art
and life And next to her is the painter himself Gustav
Klimt

Maria approaches them Ferdinand smiles at her lovingly And
finally Adele looks up at her and reaches out for her hand
and takes it in hers And when she speaks it is in German

ADELE ADELE (CONT’D)
Thank you Dankeschén
MARIA MARIA (CONTD)
I did it for all of us Ich habe es fiir uns alle
getan

EXT ELIZABETHSTRASSE DAY

Randy is waiting for Maria outside the house He hears
something and turns And there she is standing on the
threshold of the house She walks towards him and when she
reaches him she looks slightly different - in her eyes the
knowledge that even though the past can never be put right
she has fulfilled her purpose by restoring justice With
that comes a relief And she wouldn’t have been able to do
it without him Job done

MARIA
Let’s go home Randy Your family
is waiting
INT BELVEDERE GALLERY DAY
