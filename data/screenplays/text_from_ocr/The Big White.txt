The dumpster lid BANGS shut reopens a beat later A moment of
calm until

two garbage bags SLAM against the inside of the lid It falls
shut with a CLANG

3 EXT TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT

The lid reopens Night time now as a street lamp BUZZES to

aged MAN in work clothes checks to make sure hes alone He
gently lowers

the lid opens it again a moment later this time balancing a
mini-bar fridge on

his shoulder He dumps the appliance into the bin and runs off

The lifeless body of a fair-sized man comes CRASHING into the
garbage
SIRENS closer A man seen only in silhouette leans in to pull

some garbage
over the corpse A second man looks in then pulls the first

man away

MANS VOICE
Well get him later Cmon

The lid drops

6 EXT CITY STREET - DAY

A cookie-cutter subdivision Old pine trees poke through the
snow cover that

blankets the neighborhood HOWARD (30s) a burly outdoors type

unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup TED
WATTERS (late

20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat walks down the

Ted walks up the driveway grabs the wood slats makes a ramp by
leaning
them against the rear bumper

HOWARD (contd)

Howard maneuvers the snowmobile down the ramp his back turned
toward

Ted -- who has taken out a small cam-corder and is taping
Howard

Howard finally has the snowmobile on the ground Hes breathing
heavy as he
pulls off his mitt to shake hands

HOWARD
More than I could normally afford Ill tell ya
(seeing the camera)
Hey What do you think youre you doing

As Ted and Howard continue to talk we PULL BACK to reveal we
are watching

Teds video playing on a VCR that is --

8 INT INSURANCE OFFICE COMMON AREA - DAY

A group of office WORKERS look on very much impressed as a
stunned
Howard stares at the camera

TED (0S)
Howard you seem like a reasonable kind of guy
Lets you and me talk

TIGHT ON WATTERS at his nearby cubicle typing frenetically on
his computer

At first he appears to be working until we realize that on his
computer screen

pixilated Zombies die in silent anguish beneath an unholy hail
of bullets A

Miami Dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration

As the tape finishes a smattering of APPLAUSE from his
colleagues Ted
gives a small wave over the cubicle wall

TED (contd)
Thank you Just happy to give something back to
Liberty Capital
(to himself - bitter)
After all theyve done for me

INT INSURANCE OFFICE COMMON AREA - DAY

oo

CAM (30s) Native-American Alaskan walks over Ted immediately
hits a key
that turns the screen to a spread-sheet

CAM
That was really cool It was like watching Cops

TED
He was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disc

CAM
You know I dont want to bitch or anything but you
were supposed to take me along on that one

TED
Couldnt find you

CAM
I know you know this but the sooner they think I can
handle calls on my own the sooner theyll kick you
back down south

TED
Ive been hearing that for 13 months and six days
Cam After a while it gets a little old
(off Cams look)
Next time okay
Good enough Cam moves off Back to the zombie blood bath
The phone

RINGS Ted picks up his eyes never wavering from the gore
intensive

computer game

TED (contd)
Claims Ted Watters Sure

A final key stroke separates one last zombie from its entrails

10 INT INSURANCE OFFICE BRANCHS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

TIGHT ON A MOUNTED SALMON

We PULL BACK to see the walls lined with souvenirs of a life
spent on the

edge of the wilderness citations from the Rotarians pictures
of sponsored

hockey teams We are --

FRANK BRANCH (50s) a mid-level management type sits across from
PAUL

BARNELL (40s) a mild-mannered everyman wrapped in a cheap suit
Paul

takes in the display The two men sit in silence smiling
politely at one another

PAUL
Thats quite the fish

Branch is about to answer when Ted enters with a slim file

BRANCH
Paul Barnell Ted Watters

Handshakes Paul makes steady eye contact Ted notices
BRANCH (contd)
Mr Barnell wants to talk to us about his brothers life
insurance policy

Ted sits and flips open the file

TED
Raymond isnt it

PAUL
Yes Raymond You see as Ive already explained to
Mr Branch hes been gone for five years now and I
thought it might be time to move on

TED
By move on you mean

BRANCH
cash in Raymonds policy

Ted smiles to himself

PAUL

I just thought well its pretty unlikely hes still

alive
My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after

each other if anything should ever happen And to

be frank moneys a little --

TED
I understand Mr Barnell but heres the thing With no
actual body under Alaskan statutes a person must
be missing for seven years before he or she can be
legally declared dead and thats not withstanding an
investigation period where concerned parties can
take up to another year to file interventions
concerning the motion So even though your
brothers status is undetermined at this point theres
really very little we can do for you

Ted flips the file shut Case closed Branch not entirely
happy with Teds
demeanor forces a smile

BRANCH
Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss

Branch looks at Ted Ted turns to Paul

TED
Oh absolutely

GUY soggy

pizza box in hand

Hey

PIZZA GUY
Hi there Thatll be 1297

Ted looks at his watch

PIZZA GUY

TED

worthless

PIZZA GUY

Would you just give him the money already

PIZZA GUY
Its not my decision

TED
I know that Im just saying
PIZZA GUY
Sure

TED
You understand though

PIZZA GUY
Absolutely

TED
It wouldnt take much

PIZZA GUY
Full disclosure to the pizza consumer Ill be sure to
pass that along

The delivery guy leaves

Ted walks back into the living room Tiffany comes over grabs
a slice

TIFFANY
Why you gotta argue with the service industry

TED
The problem with people today is they dont expect
anyone to tell the truth
Weve just come to accept lying as acceptable

TIFFANY
If this is another passiveaggressive shot at Psychic
Buddies all our ads state for amusement purposes

only
TED

Tiff it has nothing to do with look just forget it
TIFFANY

You remember being amused dont ya honey
What is with you anyway

TED
Want to know whats with me Im on the verge of
cracking the biggest case of my career one that
corporate has to notice and nobody gives a crap
Not my boss and not even my girlfriend

TIFFANY
So this is my fault

TED
No its not your fault I just want to live somewhere
where road hazards dont have antlers and the pizza
doesnt have to be delivered by dogsled

Tiffany storms off as Ted flops onto the couch swipes the snow
from the top of
the pizza box and hits play on the DVD

EDWARD G ROBINSON
What kind of outfit is this anyway Are we an
insurance company or a bunch of dim-witted
amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that

Tiffany turns from the bedroom door almost in tears

TIFFANY
You know even though Edward G Robinson wins
everyone like Fred MacMurray better

crime People around here have been known to

against the cold

MINISTER
When someone is taken from us at such a young
age we often ask ourselves why What possible
purpose could this serve

The Minister is temporarily lost from view

MINISTER (contd)
(just a voice in the white)
Why is God who is a loving God capable of such
things

The snow clears Paul a pillar of strength discreetly checks

Paul looks nervously at Margaret who is about to reply As her
mouth

engages a gust of wind obliterates most of her words except
for

MARGARET
--nun banger

The Minister smiles he must have misunderstood

MINISTER

Paul turns to see Ted approaching A blast of snow obscures his
view When
Ted reappears hes just a few steps away

moments peace do they

PAUL

TED
(surprised)

appropriate time

TED

insurance company that hasnt paid off your policy

PAUL
I had to borrow money for the casket Mr Ted

TED
You are breaking my heart

PAUL
No I doubt that They asked me to bring some
photos of Raymond Guess its gonna be a pretty
big story

He pulls out some shots of his brother They whip around in the
wind and
blowing snow

PAUL (contd)

his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run --
BANGBANGBANGBANG

One bullet bounces off Pauls car One hits Raymond With a
quizzical look on

his face he drops to his knees A large crimson stain forms on
his jacket

Everything goes quiet except for the sounds coming from
