Introduction

In 2011 a former Pixar colleague Emma Coats Tweeted a
series of storytelling aphorisms that were then compiled
into a list and circulated as “Pixar’s 22 Rules Of
Storytelling”

She clearly stated in her compilation blog post that the
Tweets were “a mix of things learned from directors and
coworkers at Pixar listening to writers and directors talk
about their craft and via trial and error in the making of
my own films”

We all learn from each other at Pixar and it’s the most
amazing “film school” you could possibly have Everybody at
the company is constantly striving to learn new things and
push the envelope in their own core areas of expertise

Sharing ideas is encouraged and it is in that spirit that
the original 22 Tweets were posted

However a number of other people have taken the list as a
Pixar formula a set of hard and fast rules that we follow
and are “the right way” to approach story

But that is not the spirit in which they were intended
They were posted in order to get people thinking about each
topic as the beginning of a conversation not the last
word

After all a hundred forty characters is far from enough to
serve as an “end all and be all” summary of a subject as
complex and important as storytelling

So since Pixar’s name is associated with that list I
decided it’d be beneficial to the world’s storytellers for
another Pixarian to write a series of blog articles to look
at the aphorisms one-by-one and analyze them

In the spirit of inspiration exploration and discussion in
which the advice was intended I found points of agreement
and disagreement and offer up caveats expansions and
excisions that I felt made the advice stronger

This book is a compilation of those blog articles (with a
few edits most notably this intro stopping before going
off-topic)
Rule 1

You admire a character for trying more than
for their successes

In the main the statement rings true It’s good
foundational advice especially since many storytellers “go
too easy on” their characters because they like them Drama
comes from struggle and empathy and admiration come from
seeing someone trying in the face of difficult odds

A film in which the protagonist never fails at anything is
rather devoid of conflict and is unlikely to hold anyone’s
interest but the statement is ultimately about the balance
between seeing a character fail and seeing them succeed
impacting audience appreciation of the character — not
about plot dynamics

Furthermore most people consider themselves average even
mundane When they try to do things they focus on what
they get wrong and how far short of their own goals
theyve fallen

Characters who do the same thing will more readily evoke
empathy and sympathy from the audience

A classic easily understood example is the true underdog
story The everyman trying to do something only special men
are supposed to be able to do

The obvious example is a story like Rudy but Indiana Jones
and John McClaine are beloved “relatable” action adventure
characters in their first films because they are
vulnerable both physically and emotionally

But there is an assumption in the premise of the statement
that can also lead storytellers into trouble if they’re not
careful that characters need to be admired

Sometimes you want a character to be interesting more than
admired or even sympathetic — perhaps even going so far as
creating a protagonist that’s interesting and questionable
unlikable or even reviled

And a character that succeeds more than she fails can be
interesting
Superhero stories often rely on this to establish that the
hero is accustomed to easy success and so is the world she
protects — to underscore how powerful the bad guy really
must be to upset this status quo

Antihero stories on the other hand flip the trope to show
you someone who is good at being bad so when they’re
trying to be good you know they’re giving up something that
worked for them in order to change (That sacrifice being a
crucial often overlooked element of a great character arc
— one that applies to all characters not just antiheroes)

Another “clever” use of flipping the trope comes in stories
where the fact that the protagonist has no conflict in
their life is their main source of conflict But this is
uncommon and is rarely done well

So while the statement is true when your goal is to have
your character fit the “admirable sympathetic character
that audiences easily empathize with” — that isn’t the only
kind of character people will find engaging Therefore if
a sympathetic character isn’t what your story calls for
look at how you can change that success vs failure balance
to serve the character you’re creating
Rule 2

Keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an
audience not what’s fun to do as a writer
They can be very different

This may seem like strange advice at first blush If
something is interesting to you as an audience shouldn’t
it also be fun to write

Seriously I’m not being flip Storytellers should enjoy
writing things that they enjoy reading and viewing

If that’s not enjoyable to you maybe storyteller is the
wrong calling for you Every story needs to flow from a
place of joy passion love or yearning within the
storyteller or it certainly will not be fun to write or
to read

The premise of the statement really stems from the common
notion that writers in particular naturally enjoy writing
internal monologue evocatively meandering descriptions
abstraction and other things that “shouldn’t” be ina
screenplay

This advice was clearly given to Emma by someone who
adheres to that common notion that all writers prefer
writing things that ought not to be in film blueprints
which isn’t true Many writers completely enjoy writing
action concise description and external subtextual
dialog

But what should be in a script depends on the target
audience of the screenplay — meaning the audience who will
read the script not who will see the finished film

If you are writing a spec that you’re hoping will sell or

get you a job don’t do any of those “writerly” things like
write novelistic description or rely on internal monologues
to carry the story (or at least use them very sparingly)

If it’s a work-for-hire do whatever the person who hired
you asked for (in Hollywood that’s generally not to fill
the script with internal thoughts and meandering
descriptions — but the producer or director may ask for
exceptions to that rule)
If you’re writing a nolo-budget script you’re going to
shoot yourself you may do more of those things — so long
as you have a clear idea of how they’re going to get on-
screen If you can’t visualize it (or speak it aloud) you
can’t shoot it

A common example of a “writerly mistake” that elicits this
advice is to load “a look” with a lot of subtext For
example

He looked at her as if to say ‘how can you think that
about me after all these years’

A look can only say so much so you’ll need to limit what
you try to say with it to things actors can actually convey
in a look or action Which is a lot less than might hope
(no affront to actors intended they can say a lot more
with a look than the rest of us) Otherwise put it into
action or dialogue subtext

If you’re excited about the idea of a quiet character who
generally “lives in her head” either do the “bad” thing
and use voice over get very creative about expressing that
through action and subtext or write a novel

As for extensive descriptions and abstract ideas about
theme quite often Directors who are writing for themselves
will put those things into at least one draft of the
script Since they’re visually designing the film as they
write it they know how they want to visualize even the
abstract ideas (perhaps implying it with an effect camera
angle filter or color treatment)

You can’t usually get away with extensive description or
abstract thematic notes in a spec or even a work-for-hire
script but plenty of people do it for themselves If
you’re writing for yourself you can too (Though generally
it gets taken out of drafts that go to actors)

But always keep in mind
Film is a visual medium
Ultimately a screenwriter is trying to convey to the entire
cast and crew the basics of how the film will be staged and

shot not just the character dialog and emotions Anyone
who thinks otherwise is in the wrong business
There’s also the aspect of the rule statement which comes
from the assumption that because writers find certain
aspects of writing more fun they prefer writing things
that are structured for other media than film

Watching a film even the funky experimental stuff is a
different experience than reading And commercial films
have a certain three act structure that is expected to
underlie the narrative You need to meet those
expectations

The less filmic the writing the less filmic the audience
experience will be when it’s translated to screen Whether
that’s a good or bad thing is debated endlessly Ultimately
that’s a matter of style tone and material versus return-
on-investment considerations and cast and crew
capabilities

Making a “no-budget” experimental film (or something for a
government film board) Do any crazy thing you want
Anything Those kinds of films are playgrounds and
laboratories for wild ideas and sometimes those
experiments even result in something amazing

Otherwise if the goal is to write a script that will
attract a Hollywood cast and crew get prodco and studio
backing and find a general film audience — write a film

That means stick to film structure and pacing and write
concisely and visually

Finally perhaps what the statement is trying to get at is
don’t be self-indulgent To avoid being self-indulgent
simply think about an audience that isn’t you

You have to enjoy storytelling to a broader audience than
the one inside your skull or film is the wrong medium for
you Filmmaking is the most collaborative art
entertainment process that exists and film viewing is a
global shared experience

That doesn’t mean you bring nothing of yourself to
screenwriting of course All stories come from inside the
storyteller

But when writing screenplays you do need to be cognizant
that you’re just making a blueprint for a series of
collaborative shared experiences — not an isolated
recounting of your internal thoughts

As a writer I love isolated recounting of internal
thoughts A lot I just don’t think a screenplay is
(usually) the right place to put them

Ultimately I believe that the subtext of rule 2 is all
these things

Write something that is structured like a film not
some other medium

Write for an audience that exists outside your head

¢ Write visually

Do these things because a screenplay is just a
blueprint for a film write a blueprint for a film
not a finished product that is intended primarily to
be read

If you’re writing screenplays the reason is almost
certainly because you love films

So when writing them put yourself into your film audience
mindset and have fun doing those things Get into it and
enjoy it and it will make your film writing better

At least this will make your commercial screenplays in the
Hollywood mold better (which let’s be honest with
ourselves includes the majority of “Indie” films as well)
Rule 3

Trying for theme is important but you won’t
see what the story is actually about til
you’re at the end of it Now rewrite

I wholeheartedly agree that writers should write all the
way to the end and then rewrite In fact I’d recommend
doing that more than once As the common aphorism “all
writing is rewriting” points out that’s the only way to
really find your story

But as for not seeing what the story is actually about (its
theme) until you’re at the end of it — I take the opposite
tack I don’t think you should even start the story until
you know what the end is therefore what it’s about

“What it’s about” will likely change during the course of
writing a draft but it’s too common to meander and write
yourself into corners when trying to get to an unspecified
ending

So if you don’t know how your story ends when you start
writing be prepared to pay a lot extra to get there

It’s like any journey you start without knowing where
you’re going it may be exhilarating and full of
possibilities the detours and pit-stops may be an
adventure and the end result may be fantastic — but it’s
not efficient and there’s a very real possibility you’ll
get hopelessly lost and simply give up along the way

Starting at the end when creating your outline (or
treatment or mental map) will make your life a lot easier
And don’t worry that starting with a solid idea of where
you’re going will stifle your creativity and take all the
joy and inspiration out of the journey It won’t

For one thing until you’ve actually written at least one
draft everything is still just preliminary theoretical
While you’re writing towards an ending you’ve already come
up with you may suddenly find that the story is telling
you to go elsewhere

That can happen even when you know where you’re going
because knowing where you’re going is not a barrier to
inspiration rather it makes room for more inspiration
because there’s no need to be constantly “figuring it out”
at every turn So when this sort of inspiration strikes
stop and take the time to rework your ending and the map
to get there before continuing You can always go back to
the old map if needed

Even after you’ve done all that you are likely to reach
the (potentially shifting) ending only to discover that in
getting there you’ve got a whole new or clearer idea of
what the story is actually about and therefore about how
everything you just wrote should change

That’s why people say all those things like “writers
write” and “all writing is rewriting” and “stories are
never finished they’re just abandoned” and “holy 3
writing is difficult — I thought you just typed-in every
idea you have as you have them and then people love you and
throw money at you”

So ultimately what this advice is trying to tell us is
don’t get bogged down in theoretical analysis of theme in
lieu of actually writing the story

This is an especially damning temptation for screenwriters
because screenplays are very structured and formal and
there is a glut of gurus out there who peddle very
mechanical theory-based approaches to storytelling

Those prescriptive methodologies can be great if you find
one that actually works the same way your own mind works
but even so formal exercises about finding your theme (or
character beats or anything else) will only ever take you
so far

After all the end product is the actual writing not any of
the notes outlines or worksheets produced along the way

Belaboring how each scene reflects theme and trying to
perfect it is wasting time especially in the first draft
when you’ve not yet written through the piece at least once
and thereby given yourself a firmer idea of what your story
is actually all about Once you’ve written at least one
draft you can start to “perfect” all those beats through-
lines and setuppayoff moments in rewrites

Ultimately storytelling is about feeling and even once
you find your theme and refine your story structure you
still need to make your audience feel it
So whatever methodology you may prefer for finding theme
and structure make sure that for each draft you also set
all the formalities aside do a pass where you focus solely
on emotion and entertainment
Rule 4

Once upon a time there was - Every day
- One day - Because of that
Because of that - Until finally

This keen little template is called “the story spine” It
comes from the world of improv theater and was created by
Kenn Adams not Pixar

Pixar does offer improv classes and has a standing improv
theater group that performs weekly so many employees have
been exposed to the story spine as a creative exercise

It’s a fun useful exercise for improv theater And a great
way to “riff on” structural ideas at a very high level
since it is a simplified statement of an idea that many
other systems and theories also elucidate that a story is
a change from an old status quo to a new one “old world”
to “new world” through action and conflict

You can find similar but more expansive ideas along the
same line in the writings of Syd Field Robert McKee Blake
Snyder Chris Vogler John Truby Lew Hunter etc

Each of their models is partitioned and phrased
differently and some are very formally rigorous while
others are more flexible but they are all saying the same
basic thing

A story has a setup change through conflict and
resolution

Understanding some model of basic story structure is
crucial for all storytellers Whether it’s this exact
phrasing or not depends on how well it enables you to
actually comprehend the principals

Filling in the blanks will only get you so far you need to
study and internalize the plot and character dynamics that

the model represents

Unfortunately the strength of the story spine its
simplicity is also its weakness

It’s too simple for many uses
It needs more depth to be a guide for narrative drama With
this in mind another way to rephrase the story spine would
be to say that a story has

A setup that introduces the characters and the world

Action in the normal status quo world that
establishes the baseline of the characters’ prior
lives

An inciting incident that disrupts the status quo and
poses the thematic question in the form of a decision
the protagonist must make

A series of escalating events triggered by the
decision the protagonist makes in each preceding
event that build into a climax

A climax and resolution

More simply

Introduce the protagonist and her world

Present the protagonist with a critical world-
changing challenge

Litter the path to confronting that critical challenge
with increasingly difficult obstacles

See how the protagonist overcomes the obstacles and
takes on the big challenge

Notice that I’ve added explicit mention of the protagonist
and conflict (and its escalation)

A crucial flaw in the story spine as a model for all story
structure is that its phraseology is all about outcomes
Character isn’t explicitly mentioned

Neither is conflict escalating or otherwise Story spine
exercises can easily lead to things like this

Once upon a time there was a piemaker Every day people
came to buy his pies One day they stopped coming Because
of that he lowered his prices Because of that people
came in droves Because of that he couldn’t keep up with
the work Because of that he had to hire staff Because of
that production increased Until finally he owned the
biggest pie company in the land

The story is mechanical flat and has no tension or
escalation In short it has no drama I have no idea who
the piemaker is as a person And said piemaker isn’t
changed by her “ordeal” It’s just not a very interesting
piece of narrative at all

Good stories are dynamic Characters face challenges and
are changed by them for better or worse There is conflict
that escalates and releases characters experience lows and
highs victories and defeats Sudden (but motivated)
changes in direction alter the nature of the challenges as
well as escalating them And set-ups may pay off at varying
intervals They are not merely a linear sequence of
outcomes

And the story spine provides no context to remind you about
all that

Adams created the story spine for improv theater and that
is a discipline unto itself with its own goals and rules
Improv is useful for writers directors and actors in other
media as a great way to approach “riffing” on stories to
open your mind to possibilities rather than second-guessing
them or obsessing over details

But improv techniques can actually be a detrimental way to
approach understanding and structuring finished narratives
because the goals of improv theater are different than the
goals of narrative drama

Improv theater prefers stories that are single-threaded
wander until the climax and are propelled through
agreement or conflict resolution more than disagreement and
conflict

So I don’t personally recommend Adams’ story spine as a
tool for anything other than riffing or coming up with the
most basic concepts for a story framework

It’s a good way to structure a pitch but not deep enough
to guide you through the whole script by itself

When it comes to structuring a narrative for film (or TV
comics or novels) either of my rephrasings of the story
spine above — or any one of the structure models offered by
the authors I mentioned — are more helpful simplifications
to work from
Rule 5

Simplify Focus Combine characters Hop
over detours You’ll feel like you’re losing
valuable stuff but it sets you free

Or more simply
Rule 5 Simplify

This is the piece of advice that is hardest for most
storytellers to hear because simplifying always means
cutting good stuff as well as bad

That last sentence is a rephrasing of writers’ “kill your
darlings” wisdom that dates back to before Faulkner said it
(at least to Arthur Quiller-Couch)

But the idea that you have to lose scenes characters and
ideas that are actually good in order to cut away clutter
so the audience can clearly see the core ideas in your
story goes back long before that

And sometimes you do indeed have to cut material you know
is awesome in order to do what’s right for the story

Great scenes that play well in isolation but don’t add new
information blow the pacing or otherwise just add dead
weight have to go

Characters that are redundant need to be combined If two
characters interact with and reflect the personality of
your protagonist in similar ways they ought to be the same
character

Screen stories in particular need to be concise Each new
scene and every character should give the audience new
information and different perspectives Redundancies rarely
work in screenwriting and filler may fix pacing issues but
the audience will notice that not much is really going on
in those scenes and lose interest (even if each individual
scene is action-packed)

So unless the scene is moving the story forward it is a
candidate for removal (Note that I said the story not
just the plot Emotional scenes that “stall” the plot can
be crucial for certain kinds of stories with a certain kind
of pacing)

This can of course be taken too far Few stories need to
be one character delivering a monologue in an empty room
That’s too simple

So you need to be careful about simplification An
excessive focus on economical storytelling can cause you to
remove conflict abridge arcs and remove subplots until
you’ve got a story that lacks depth Pacing and tone can
also suffer greatly from excessive cutting

A story that is an endless barrage of action and new
information without ever slowing down to consider what just
happened can leave your audience overwhelmed and confused
Trimming too much meat along with the fat leads to stories
that are just as boring as meandering ones And a story
that’s not clever at all is just as grating as one that’s
too clever

Where the balance lies is tricky Audience expectation
modulates based on what kind of story is being told anda
writer’s (or filmmaker’s) style

What simplification comes down to is separating the story
essentials from the unnecessary flourishes And since every
story is different it is up to the writer to determine
what the essentials are Finding that balance is a big part
of the job of storyteller There’s no “trick” to it other
than trying things until it works

Even accounting for style and genre there are still some
more objective ways for a writer to self-assess in this
area It requires knowing your theme character arc and
ending so you can mark as candidates for removal any scene
that isn’t adding new information about one or more of
those elements and any character that isn’t giving you a
different perspective on them

You also need to be clear about tone and pacing Some
stories call for more contemplative moments or a larger
cast of characters than others Setting tone through
scenery and establishing conflict in long low-impact
sequences may be exactly what your Merchant-Ivory-inspired
historical romance needs but it is definitely not what
your adrenaline-pumped shoot-em-up is calling for
What too often leads to trouble here is your own confusion
about some essential element of your own story such as the
theme or the tone You can’t hop over detours unless you
actually know where you’re going and trying to do so can
lead you to cut necessary elements when you think you’re
being efficient

It is self-defeating and time wasting to attempt
simplification until you are very clear on what your theme
arc conclusion tone and pacing actually are A bloated
first draft is nothing to be ashamed of if that’s what you
need in order to find those elements and be in the position
to sensibly simplify your story Once you know trim it
down in rewriting

Even baroque styles benefit from simplification because
all that florid writing is still wasted if what it’s saying
is irrelevant to the purpose of the story

Your challenge as a writer is to make everything in the
story somehow relevant to those story elements even if
subtly so The best scenes and characters fit the
established tone and are relevant to theme plot and arc
simultaneously

Thus to make rule five more useful I’1l add a criteria for
what scenes and characters to cut

If a scene or character is not providing new information
about or an interesting perspective on something relevant
to the theme plot or character arc of your story cut it
Rule 6

What is your character good at comfortable
with Throw the polar opposite at them
Challenge them How do they deal

There’s a problem with the phrasing of this otherwise
excellent advice that can lead storytellers into a common
trap

The sound advice in this statement is “take your characters
outside their comfort zones” “challenge your characters
and see how they respond” and (implied) “the evolution of
how your character responds to challenges is their arc”

But “throw the polar opposite at them” if taken literally
leads to merely sticking your character in a contrarian
world That’s flat there’s no build and no nuance And it
denies your audience the opportunity to see the character
being good at what they’re good at

Since falling back on mechanical merely contrarian
conflict is indeed a trap storytellers too often fall into
when grasping for conflict it makes the phrasing gaffe all
the more unfortunate

For example if your character is good at playing the
violin the polar opposite is “not playing the violin” But
that is only an interesting challenge for so many beats

It’s also important to keep in mind that this concept is
most interesting and useful when it’s applied to emotional
strengths and weaknesses rather than skill-based ones

Forcing a character not to use a skill is mechanical and
will only get you so far It’s a useful kind of conflict to
have but not the central one

Forcing a character out of their emotional comfort zone and
challenging her to change her emotional responses — that’s
the stuff character arcs are made of

For example a character that copes with the world through
lies and deceit being forced into a situation where she
must tell the truth is an interesting conflict one that
leads to a clear character arc (either to greater
truthfulness or self-destruction if it’s a tragedy)
You want to start by throwing your character into exactly
what they’re good at to show the audience how good she is
at it The liar character needs to be a great liar who gets
(the wrong kind of) rewards for it

Then you put her in the situation where she needs to not
fall back into that comfort zone in order to succeed and
that is the dramatic situation that will force her to
change

But later in the story as she is changing and embracing
that change you may throw her into a situation where her
old ways would be an obvious positive solution to the
situation in order to show how moving outside her comfort
zone is challenging her

The conflict in such a scene is between going back to her
old ways finding a way to use that aspect of herself as a
tool without getting sucked back into negative aspects her
old ways or how can find an equally successful strategy
that doesn’t resort to her old ways at all

Presenting the already-arcing character with a situation
where the most expeditious and effective solution to their
situation would be to fall back on their old ways after
you’ve already given her compelling reasons to disavow that
behavior is great drama

The audience will want to see if your character maintains
her emerging new self in light of a situation where
falling-back into her emotional comfort zone would be
practical and useful but has already been shown to be a
morally emotionally or philosophically terrible idea

That deceitful character for instance may be put ina
situation where she should lie even though she’s already
seen how much damage her deceitful ways have caused her
How she responds to that is at the right point in the
story even more interesting than how she responded to a
situation where not lying at all was the proper response

To summarize what you want is a build from showing the
comfort zone to challenging it with situations where the
opposite response is necessary to further challenging the
character with situations where the old response is better
The dramatic conclusion of the arc is how the character
faces that challenge without reverting to her old self
Rule 7

Come up with your ending before you figure
out your middle Seriously Endings are
hard get yours working up front

As I also mentioned in the analysis of point three I agree
with this completely In fact I take it farther you
should come up with your ending even before you figure out
your beginning

Having your ending figured out up-front gives you a goal to
write towards It’s a lot easier to figure out how to get
to the end if you know where it is The most efficient way
to approach the task of structuring a story is

¢ Start with basic dramatic concept which necessarily
has a set-up and a pay-off (ie a beginning and an
ending)

¢ Figure out the details of the ending the resolution
to all the conflicts and the answer to all the
questions This means knowing who the protagonist is
emotionally at the end of the story how the central
conflict has resolved and what that means in terms of
the thematic statement philosophical stakes

Figure out the beginning the set-up of the conflict
and the positing of all the questions Establish who
the protagonist is at the beginning what the physical
(plot) character (emotional) and thematic
(philosophical) stakes are and what the central
conflict is that illustrates these elements

Plot the middle as an arc between these two points

Some of you are probably thinking “but that’s so rigid I
can’t do that my ideas just come to me” Mine do too
That’s the “Start with a basic concept” phase (And a
million intermediate “I just had a great idea I’m gonna
try it out” phases)

But once you have a basic concept you still have to
structure the story Because even if an entire story from
beginning to end comes to you in a flash it’s still just a
basic concept There’s still work to be done to turn it
into a finished story And thinking through its structure
in the manner suggested (once you’ve written down the flash
of insight) is a good way to save a lot of grief later on

This approach is also a good way to rethink your story
before each rewrite iteration

How has the basic concept changed Okay now is the ending
still working If not how does changing it change the rest
of the story And so on for the beginning and middle
until you’ve thought through the broad changes before
diving into the details

If you always take the time to really decide where you’re
going you’ll always find a way to get there It may not be
the right way the first time you try and you may get there
and find out you need to be somewhere else — but that’s
what rethinks and rewrites are for
Rule 8

Finish your story let go even if it’s not
perfect In an ideal world you have both
but move on Do better next time

The advice to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good
is tried and true advice because it’s one of the most
difficult yet crucial things for any artist to do

You do have to declare “imperfect” work to be finished in
order to get things out there at all

Because there is no such thing as perfection (or an ideal
world for that matter) and the idea that something could
ever possibly be perfect is a problematic conclusion that
can be drawn from the phrase “even though it may not be
perfect”

It may seem obvious that perfection is impossible and that
the statement is implicitly taking that position but I
think it’s worth splitting hairs over and digging into a
bit because the notion of perfection can be so vexing and
damaging to so many artists

Perfection paralysis is very real and can be
artistically crippling So letting go is a crucial
emotional skill all artists must cultivate

People in the industry like to paraphrase French poet Paul
Valery and say “a movie is never finished it’s abandoned”
This is especially true of any commercial art because
commercial deadlines are not exclusively self-imposed

But it’s ultimately true of all art because perfection is
impossible Seriously it’s impossible and if you believe
otherwise save yourself a lifetime of heartache and disavow
that belief immediately

The advice is actually trying to make that point but the
phrasing of the last clause has a bit of residual “artists’
dream” in it Saying it “may not” be perfect implies that
it also may

But don’t think ill of the advice giver we all let that
dream slip into our thoughts and words about our work at
times and it takes a lot of conscious effort to try to
fight against it So that’s what I’m trying to help with in
this article

Don’t even try to imagine an ideal world in which your
story is perfect it’s a total waste of time (unless you’re
writing a story about an ideal world in which stories are
perfect in which case go for it)

It’s good to be passionate about your work but not when it
prevents you from having a career Careers can be launched
by a single project but can’t be sustained by one

If you’ve only ever worked on one project you’re not ready
for a career because you haven’t developed the skills
needed to sustain one (A lifelong passion project isn’t a
career and all the advice in this series is for people who
want careers — devoted dreamers don’t need or heed any
advice at all so I don’t need to give them any)

One of my writing partnerships recently dissolved in part
due to this very issue The other participant in the
project is overly invested in the project and his goal is
perfection He won’t move on clear his mind and broaden
his skills and experience by focusing on another project
for a while Instead he keeps getting coverage and
consultant feedback finding out that it’s not perfect
then repeating the process of digging into an empty mine

Naturally any feedback one gets varies from person-to-
person and from read-to-read That’s the nature of
feedback Unless someone is paying you to please them it’s
irrelevant to try to do so and trying to “please them all”
is impossible especially while refusing to let go of
things most readers say aren’t working but which please
you

And trying to please everyone including you is the
pursuit of perfection

This pursuit often comes as a result of a lack of self-
confidence If you don’t believe in your own ability you
don’t feel confident enough to move on You don’t trust
your own instincts about what the right version of the
story is so you rely on others which leads to endless
thrashing trying to please them all Maybe you don’t even
know whether or not you even have another story in you to
move on to so you hide behind the search for the elusive
“perfect” version of your current story
But to succeed as a professional storyteller you need to

develop the skills to know when the changes you’re making
are merely making the story different not better and to
know that’s when you’ve run out of ideas and are finished

Perfection as a goal is always entwined with self-doubt
second-guessing and thrashing on changes that aren’t
necessarily making anything better (often because out of
ignorance the goal is too vague) This situation it makes
you vulnerable to being derailed by advice no mater how
well meaning

A storyteller’s job is to know what story they’re trying to
tell and tell it to the best of their ability at the time

Once you’ve done that you’re finished Move on

(If you feel that you didn’t do justice to a story idea you
really really love you can always come back to it later
Much later As in however long it takes until you’ve
genuinely got a fresh perspective and new ideas and aren’t
just thrashing That could be years In the meantime you
have to work on other ideas That’s every artist’s job)
Rule 9

When you’re stuck make a list of what
WOULDNT happen next Lots of times the
material to get you unstuck will show up

This rule has a great gem of an idea in it that having
ideas trying them and then rejecting the ones that don’t
work is the right way to find the best idea

But the terse format has led to a statement that taken at
face value can potentially get you stuck

Because infinity things wouldn’t happen next

You could spend the rest of your life writing down an
unbounded list of what wouldn’t happen next The important
issue worth delving into is how to constrain this exercise
in order to make it useful

For example if two awkward teenagers have just bumped into
each other in the local record store and you start writing

1 Everyone sits down and eats some pie

2 Earth consumed by World Serpent

3 Close-up shot of someone solving differential
equations

4 etc

It’s going to be a while before you say “oh that thing
that wouldn’t happen next is actually the right thing for
my story” (Unless you’re Luis Bufuel)

But even if you omit gross non-sequiturs from the list
it’s still a potentially very long list if it’s merely
“what wouldn’t happen next” in terms of the plot and
overall world mechanics

Better to ask how the characters in the scene wouldn’t
respond to the situation to ground your ideas about what
wouldn’t happen in the personalities of the characters
involved

What’s the last thing this character would do when faced
with this situation”

It seems like a subtle difference but it’s not
Your character’s personality needs and wants goals and
obstacles and the point in their arc are all fundamental
considerations when deciding how events will unfold in your
story

The reason for the original advice is to get you thinking
about what your character wouldn’t do because especially
when you’re stuck the fallback position is to just muscle-
through with the obvious responses

Defaulting to the obvious is one thing that flattens arcs
and makes stories too predictable and the exploration of
what wouldn’t happen gets you thinking in about non-obvious
solutions

Once you’ve drawn a box around your character you then need
to think outside that box in order to keep things
interesting and stay out of ruts

By thinking about what wouldn’t happen and grounding it in
character personality want and need you’re really
exploring for things that actually could happen if you take
a more nuanced complex view of your character and the
situation

You don’t want to take actions that are totally out of
character but rather you should challenge the
preconceptions you’ve given your characters and put them in
situations where they’re forced to make uncomfortable
decisions Create novelty through character-motivated
conflict not false conflict by putting the novelty cart
before the character horse

Note that the decision-driving character isn’t always the
protagonist not in every scene Sometimes the villains and
other antagonists need to make decisions that force the
protagonist to respond Of course the protagonist’s
choices broadly should get her into and out of conflict —
but the obstacles along the way are most interesting when
provided by active antagonists

For example if the character needing to make the decision
about what happens next is an assassin and the current
situation is that she’s found the person she’s looking for
the most obvious “what wouldn’t she do next” scenario is
simply “let the target live”
But in order to make this exercise most fruitful to help
you find the pieces that will enable you to develop a
better story you want to be more specific

In the assassin example letting the target simply escape
is an option and so is maiming them but not killing them
However maybe attempting to befriend the target falling
in love with her switching sides or even deciding she is
an unworthy adversary are more interesting “what wouldn’t
happen next” choices

And that’s what the point of this exercise should be to
explore specific seemingly unlikely ways that each of the
characters involved actually could respond to the current
scene

Each individual character involved has an obvious cliche
response to whatever the current situation is that you’ve
put them into First find that (if you haven’t already)
and then challenge yourself to think through all the other
“impossible” options based on what you know about your
characters and the situation they’re in

The most compelling take on the scene is likely going to
involve seemingly “wrong” responses to the situation from
each character involved once which still meet enough
expectations about each character as to be grounded and
believable

This is not only a way to un-stick yourself when you’re
stuck but also a great way to think about creating better
scenes when you are still writing forward but have fallen
into a rut and are falling back on generic obvious scenes
Rule 10

Pull apart the stories you like What you
like in them is a part of you you’ve got to
recognize it before you can use it

This is something you should absolutely do as a general
exercise in understanding yourself as a storyteller

But it’s not necessarily useful in the middle of trying to
actually tell or write any particular story — unless you’re
stuck and are looking at similar stories specifically to
try to find structural and conceptual ideas to get your own
story moving again (A different use of story analysis than
is suggested in the advice Both are equally valid just
for different purposes )

In terms of understanding yourself as a storyteller and
playing to your own strengths this exercise will make
explicit that the things you like in all the stories are a
disparate collection of ideas tonal elements plot types
specific plot devices character tropes pacing and so on

You do need to understand all of those elements so allow
yourself to consider them all Write down each thing you
like as soon as you think of it (you can organize them into
types later) Capture your most honest unfiltered
perspective

You’ll discover that what you like won’t necessarily be the
same from story-to-story You may like one story because of
its pastoral setting and slow pace and another because
it’s dark and action-packed

Each story will “speak to you” in a different way Studying
and understanding the when how and why of each element
you like in context will help you learn to deploy the
different elements in your own stories

You’re not trying to rip-off other storytellers you’re
trying to understand what you like about your favorite
stories and then mix those ideas into your own personal
storytelling palette

The exercise will help you understand what you need to do
to write what you want to write in the way you want to
write it It will also help you determine which of the
elements you want to include in your own stories come
naturally to you and which you will have to work at since
you’ll observe that some you’ve already been doing without
thinking much about it and others you havent

But there is also a deeper digging that you should be doing
when performing this analysis figuring out the core
thematic elements that drew you to the story in the first
place

Doing this for several stories will enable you to discover
what my friend Barri Evins calls your “Personal Thematic”
a central concept that you will naturally gravitate towards
in your own storytelling because it’s what you already
gravitate towards as a story consumer

Here are some example core thematics and a filmmaker who
shares that thematic (according to my analysis)

Love Conquers All - Nora Ephron

¢ The Little Guy Can Stand Up To The Powerful and
Corrupt - Frank Capra

The Powerful and Corrupt Always Crush The Little Guy -
Alan Pakula

Things Are Never What They Seem - M Night Shyamalan

Only The Strong Survive - John Carpenter

Be True To Yourself No Matter What Society Thinks -
Tim Burton

Life’s A Bitch And Then You Die - Alex Cox

Not every single one of those filmmakers’ films is
necessarily a strict embodiment of exactly and exclusively
that thematic but elements in each one of their films draw
upon this core idea

This repetition of central ideas is inevitable because
personal thematic equals worldview which is an
interpretation of what it means to live that comes from
individual personality and style

And while one’s worldview gets refined and expanded over
time it rarely completely changes which means the
original idea always shows up somewhere in some form

Embracing your own personal thematic doesn’t mean being
formulaic or redundant there are vast numbers of ways to
embody any given idea into a specific story Rather it
means knowing yourself so you can use your own personality
and style to your advantage by developing your writers’
voice

Of course your personal thematic does become a refuge when
you’re lost in or stuck on a story and can lead to
redundancies But if you make yourself conscious of your
thematic you can also police yourself against this more
effectively because you know what to look for

Ultimately what this advice is saying is that understanding
what you like as a story consumer will enable you to become
a better storyteller through focusing on your strengths and
strengthening your weaknesses
Rule 11

Putting it on paper lets you start fixing
it If it stays in your head a perfect
idea you’ll never share it with anyone

This fantastic advice may seem trivially obvious but in
practice “perfection paralysis” is one of the greatest
enemies of all artists It comes up more than once in this
series because it’s a difficult problem for many artists to
overcome

It’s the root of pithy sayings like “don’t let the perfect
be the enemy of the good” which is basically what this
rule is a half-rephrasing of (since that saying also means
don’t overwork something trying to attain an unattainable
goal you’ve fixated on in your mind which is also to be
avoided)

But this idea of not fixating on perfection also hints at
another truth which is to take the usual advice a step
further and tell yourself

Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the bad

Because in order to create the good and then the great
you first have to get the bad version out

Then you have to start fixing it

Because as Hemingway said “The first draft of anything is
shit” Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or
has had one of those rare moments of perfect confluence of
inspiration and preparedness that leads them to think that
sort of thing is replicable It isn’t so get over it and
start loving the rewriting process because “all writing is
rewriting” (as about a zillion people have said)

Not letting the perfect be the enemy of the bad is just as
important as not letting it be the enemy of the good You
have to fail before you succeed and it’s fear of failure
that prevents people from trying

A number of my friends have attended the venerable art
school CalArts Many have told of a drawing professor
(perhaps apocryphal since nobody seems to remember his
name) who would tell students in his (required) class
“youve all got five thousand bad drawings in you and in
this class you will get every one of them out of you”

Rather than being stuck doing zero or one drawings
scripts songs or whatever your art is — just let some of
your output be bad

Of course you then need to try to fix it because revision
is the key to all arts

But sometimes you can’t fix it Sometimes that will mean
abandoning a great seemingly “perfect” idea because it’s
actually not good idea (or not a good idea for you)

Or it may mean coming back to it later when you have the
experience to make it great But if you move on in the
meantime at least you’1ll be working and that means youll
be improving

Where do we get ideas of perfection from anyway They come
from how we perceive how the outside world perceives us
relative to others In other words perfection paralysis
comes from comparing yourself to others

I happen to be pals with several A-list screenwriters and
several A-list musicians Their work is inspiring to me It
makes me want to do better Not to copy them but to earn
and maintain the status of professional peer (not their
friend — friendship is not earned its given)

It’s when I compare myself directly to them that I can get
stuck

If I find myself thinking that I can’t write this script
until I am guaranteed I can make it read as if Mr X wrote
it (or record this song until I know it’1ll sound like Mr Y
produced it or shoot this film until I know it’1ll look
like Mr Z shot it) I have to stop and lecture myself that
such thinking will lead me to never do anything

I can’t do it the same way they would because I’m not them
I may or may not be just as good as they are at some or all
elements of the craft I might even be more experienced at

some aspects of the discipline But I’m not actually them

All our ideas of perfection are created by synthesizing the
aspects of the people who inspire us that we find
appealing and often precisely on the things they bring to
the discipline that we’re not good at making it all the
more difficult to achieve this perfect ideal

Striving for perfection is self-sabotaging because it’s
falling into the trap of not letting yourself work until
youve already “perfected” exactly the parts of your craft
that you find most challenging — something you can’t
possibly do until you let yourself work

So let yourself make bad work Then revise revise revise
Even after all that some of what you let out into the
world still won’t be your best work

Not only will your early work be on average worse than
your later work as you get more experienced but sometimes
later work is also a misstep

Because everyone is always learning and you only do that
by trying things that might fail Which is anything at all
Anything you do may fail even if you’re very experienced

Just look at baseball (it’s true the only essential rule
of being a writer is that you must compare things to
baseball)

Teams play over 150 games per season That’s a lot of
experience even in just one season The 1906 Chicago Cubs
won 77 of their games — the best baseball winning
percentage ever But they lost the World Series along with
33 of their regular season games And only fourteen teams
have won 70 of the time or better in the last hundred and
forty years

Ted Williams reached base during 48 of his at-bats for
the best on-base record ever That means Ted Williams the
greatest threat at the plate in baseball history failed
more than half the time An average major league player fails to reach base 65 of
the time A 65 failure rate is considered a good record
for a solid professional career as a hitter

Every time you step up to the plate in any discipline you
risk failure The professionals are the ones who keep going
back to the plate and working it The greats are the ones
who never give up learn from every mistake and with a
combination of perseverance ability and great luck manage
to go beyond

Of course there are big differences between sports and the
arts but the basic idea is the same you have to risk
failing in order to get up there at all and when you do
fail keep stepping back up until you get a hit (But make
sure to keep studying practicing and refining your craft
in the meantime )
Rule 12

Discount the first thing that comes to mind
And the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th — get the obvious
out of the way Surprise yourself

Getting the obvious out of the way and allowing yourself to
explore and try out non-obvious choices is absolutely the
right thing to do

But at first glance this advice appears to contradict Rule
11 Thinking through these choices and discounting them
out-of-hand before trying them is a way to get stuck
thrashing around trying to find the thing that surprises
yourself rather than working your way to it

I’ve fallen into this very trap and become totally stuck
more than once Trying to think up an idea that’s maximally
new and surprising rather than just going with what seems
obvious but works and then refining it until I find the
novel idea has driven more than one of my projects right
into the “for when I have a fresh perspective” drawer

What you need to do is try the first thing that comes to
mind then try some other things and see what works best

Never completely discount anything offhand If the idea had
no merit to you whatsoever it wouldn’t have come to mind
Get it down and let it settle Revise it Play with it
That’s how you get it out of the way

Then try the second third fourth and so on until you
find the idea that works best for what you’re trying to
accomplish Do this quickly as an exercise Write down
every idea and try the ones that seem most spontaneous or
clever or interesting Chose the ideas you discount by
testing them (even if that part’s just in your head) and
proving to yourself that they’re not right

Sometimes the result of trying all those ideas will be
verification that the first idea was right all along
That’s not wasted time that’s doing the work to make sure
the idea is right And trying those other ideas may change
elements of the idea you do go with in ways you wouldn’t
have thought of if you just ratholed into that one idea
Another thing to consider when taking this advice is that
“new and surprising” can also send you off the rails if
you’re not careful Not everything needs to be new and
surprising

My pal John August came to Pixar and gave a talk about
“Genre and Expectation” in which he correctly pointed out
that genre expectations mostly need to be met and that new
and surprising elements of a story need to be carefully
chosen and placed in order be surprising without taking the
audience out of the story by failing to meet expectations
too often

Audiences generally want only one or two big surprises So
if you pack your story with nothing but surprisingly novel
ideas it will be intellectually intriguing and perhaps
respected for its vision — but it won’t necessarily be
emotionally satisfying and find a wide audience

There’s nothing wrong with experimental visionary work —
in fact it’s necessary to do some in order to challenge
yourself and the world I love experimental work and do a
lot of it myself

But in doing so you need to be cognizant that’s the kind of
project you’re creating and set your expectations (and
budgets) accordingly

Because on average audiences frankly want interesting
(not necessarily likable) characters more than they want
interesting ideas

Of course we all strive to have both great characters and
great ideas but stories with great characters in simple
mostly obvious (ie relatable) stories are usually more

endearing than stories propelled by novel ideas alone In
other words

Character wins over cleverness

Letting the goal of surprising yourself at every turn rule
your creative life can lead you into deadlock There is
simply no way you’ll have a non-obvious idea for every turn
in every story (or every riff in every song or every
drawing etc)

As I discussed in the rule 11 analysis it’s better to be
doing bad work than no work at all
If you’re disciplined about revision and open-minded about
giving the novel ideas a go when they do occur then
starting with the first thing that comes to mind is just
the first step towards the right thing — whether or not
that right thing is novel and surprising or “merely” a
personalized take on the more obvious idea
Rule 13

Give your characters opinions
Passivemalleable might seem likable to you
as you write but it’s poison to the
audience

Definitely do this But don’t just give your characters
opinions give them drives desires and goals that make
them take action The actions of a flawed character cause
conflict and consequences Conflict and its consequences is
the root of all drama

Passive main characters are the kiss of death for many
stories especially “interesting world” plot-driven stories
where the storyteller is more enamored of the world than
the characters

In such stories the storyteller shoves the protagonist
through the story with the hand of circumstance rather than
letting the protagonist’s drive propel her

Weak characters lower the stakes and are less engaging than
characters whose drives and decisions are both what gets
them into trouble and out of it

Audiences enjoy stories about characters that are driven
Driven characters are interesting which is even more
important than characters that are likable or sympathetic

In fact the desire to make characters sympathetic is often
a root cause of weak malleable characters

Writers assume that characters that are victims of
circumstance duped by villains or otherwise shoved into
trouble are more sympathetic Perhaps they are but
sympathy isn’t the most important emotion for an audience
to feel towards a main character

It’s more important that audiences feel compelled by
characters than that they like them

In a great story even a character who is pushed around by
the world and is a victim of circumstance has some goal
or desire that is being thwarted by those external actions
And even the most beaten-down protagonists must take some
action to try to change the situation if you want the
audience to believe they deserve to win

Of course at first the protagonist will fail to solve
their problems since audiences want to see and drama
requires that characters fail to resolve the central
conflict before they ultimately succeed (if they ever do)

Characters with strong viewpoints who make decisive
decisions towards their goals (however flawed those goals
may be) are whose stories audiences want to hear

For example in the biopic “The Iceman” Richie is a
repugnant character very unlikable and only marginally
sympathetic But his compulsion and the consequences it has
on his life make for an interesting story It’s an
unpleasant story but one that keeps its audience engaged

Also don’t confuse the concept of strong opinions and
drive with one particular genre tone or pacing

Driven protagonists aren’t just for action-oriented genre
stories A great romantic comedy like “As Good As It Gets”
or even a “slow” (and wonderful) period romantic drama like
“Oscar and Lucinda” also has characters with strong
opinions and drives Their goals and desires are “small”
and humanistic rather than epic and mythic but they are
what drive the characters to action all the same

This need for active characters goes beyond just “passive
characters are boring” That’s true but more importantly
active characters are necessary because their behavior
gives the audience a context through with to understand the
story at all

Because the only thing that makes any story at all
relatable to an audience is the characters No circumstance
or environment is especially compelling to us outside the
context of human emotional experience

Deep space “The Matrix” or the ocean floor are all
intellectually fascinating environments But in stories we
generally populate those places with people whose emotions
we care about And even if we chose to populate them with
space aliens pandas or race cars we anthropomorphize them
in order to enable a human audience to relate to them
Someone without a strong comprehensible point of view is
confusing to us because we can’t ground her responses to
the events of the story

To feel for someone we need to know how they are feeling
and if we don’t know their ideas about the world and see
the actions they take to put those ideas into action we
don’t really have a context for knowing how they feel about
the things that are happening to them

This is not a formula or a trick it’s cognitive science

Audiences want to see characters experiencing emotions
because that’s what we’re hard-wired to find satisfying
But unless the audience knows a character’s worldview
drives and desires they can’t contextualize and interpret
the character’s behavior and know how they feel for her
Rule 14

Why must you tell THIS story What’s the
belief burning within you that your story
feeds off of That’s the heart of it

What this is getting at is theme Though Sam Goldwyn
infamously (and perhaps apocryphally) said “If you have a
message call Western Union” it is the theme or message
that gives a story its underlying unifying meaning

What Goldwyn was (probably) complaining about was clumsily
overt messaging that comes off as preachy or talking down
to the audience In other words the storyteller’s job is to
keep the subtext out of the text and let the characters
convey the story’s message in a way that seems natural to
who those characters are

The reason why you want to tell a particular story — it’s
theme or message or heart — unifies all the other elements
of the story around a central question

In it’s most general form the central question always is
“is the protagonist’s core belief true or false”

You then populate the story with characters that have
different opinions about that question — the dreamer the
cynic the realist and all the mixtures thereof The story
drama comes from testing the belief hypothesis repeatedly
in ways that legitimately leave the question open for the
audience until the end

Your choices of characters what their motivations are and
what their arcs are all come from that central theme

So while you should solve problems with the story based on
character motivations and arc directly because that will
give the most natural feeling results for the audience If
you’ve done your job as storyteller and have populated your
story with people and situations that (in different ways)
relate to the central question such solutions necessarily
indirectly incorporate your theme

For example if you are writing a story where you want to
say that “love conquers all” then the central question is
“will love prevail over all obstacles” and your ultimate
answer in the resolution is “yes”
Your main character would either be seeking a wrong kind of
love and need to find the right kind or believe seeking
love is nonsense and have to be convinced its the greatest
thing in the world (basically)

Then the fairy tale romance believer and the jilted
“realist” would serve as the angel and devil on the main
character’s shoulders (though each is actually a bit of
both in a good story) Ultimately in the resolution the
main character would end up with Mr or Ms Right

It seems simplistic because it is And it is because it’s a
framework

A complicated framework is very hard to construct and build
upon and generally ends up with everything that sits on
top of it being unstable (ie muddled or overly analytical
or flat-out confused)

Better to have a very simple rock solid foundation and
layer complexities on top of it where appropriate Making
your foundational elements complicated won’t necessarily
make you seem like a smarter better or more unique
artist Start simple and create richness through how your
characters complicate a simple idea because of their flaws
and drives

At UCLA they say “simple story complex characters” but
even if you have a complex plot-driven story you still
want a strong unifying theme that makes every character and
every moment relevant to the why of the story rather than
being “just business” that only matters to the how of the
story (no matter how clever and entertaining that business
may be)

Even long seemingly unfocused works like James Joyces
“Ulysses” generally do have a central question lurking in
there somewhere beneath all the layers (In those kinds of
works it’s usually some variation upon the very ambitious
question “what is the meaning of life” and usually after
all the deep soul searching is over the answer is a very
unambitious “to be lived as best one can day by day”)

Every simple to state question has infinite ways to
personify perspectives on it in characters dig deeper into
its subtleties and find story richness in exploring its
nuances That’s where story depth comes from
Having a clear concise answer to the question “why am I
telling this story” in the form of a thematic statement
will enable you to always “dig deep” in the right places
and stay on-point and that will help you keep things
interesting and worthwhile for the audience
Rule 15

If you were your character in this
situation how would you feel Honesty lends
credibility to unbelievable situations

This is another one that seems obvious but even great
writers sometimes slip-up and cheat their audiences with
dishonest character moments when they forget to consciously
and constantly keep track of and reassess every scene based
on who the characters really are

And are there are of course subtleties to consider here
which will make the advice even more useful

The phrase “honesty lends credibility to unbelievable
situations” is getting at the idea that you can earn a lot
of willing suspension of disbelief and get away with
various “internal world logic” errors so long as the scene
is emotionally honest for the characters involved

That is the right idea but if you abuse this too much the
audience will get overwhelmed with unbelievable nonsense

and stop caring even if the characters are compelling and
emotionally honest

I’m referring here to unbelievability internal to the story
world violations of the world logic that you’ve
established You can get away with a greater degree of
“that couldn’t happen in the real world” unbelievability by
being emotionally compelling

Emotional engagement causing the audience to accept the
unbelievable as believable is in fact the reason why all
forms of storytelling other than strict realism work at
all Characters’ emotional responses to situations enable
the audience to understand and care about a fictionalized
world and its unrealistic rules

Relatable character emotion also adds believability to
worlds and situations we consider “inherently” believable
After all stories are artificial constructs created by the
storyteller All you get “for free” as a storyteller is a
general cultural context which is not enough to make
anything beyond the most mundane situations believable
Everything else you make believable through how your
characters react
Audiences need to be brought into story worlds and
situations with character context not just world context
even if the world is one they know If it’s a “true story”
people expect errors and embellishments and you need to
convince them of the veracity of your claims mainly through
appeal to emotion (which is why it’s so easy to lie about
true events — whatever feels true becomes true)

There is actually no “free believability” At best there is
cultural shorthand for context You still have to make all

the specific details you add to that context ring true and
relatable character emotion is the way to do this

If the audience feels that the characters in a story are
really engaged with and invested in their world they will
start to believe the unbelievable

But the situation itself must also be honest — it must be a
thematic credible (not necessarily real-world plausible
but believable within the story world) situation that feels
like a natural situation in which the emotions being
expressed make sense

There’s also the idea of putting yourself in your
character’s shoes which is how that first phrase may read
upon first glance

This of course seems like perfect advice since when we’re
always told to imagine ourselves in “someone else’s shoes”
when trying to understand their feelings and perspectives
However thinking about character development in this way
is misleading because

You’re trying to do something different from “putting
yourself in someone else’s shoes” when you’re creating a
character

When you “put yourself in someone else’s shoes” you’re
trying to imagine how you would respond if you were in
their situation It’s a thought experiment in mirror
empathy intended to get you to realize that other person’s
response to the situation they are in is understandable

In order to have some diversity in your characters you
don’t want them all to be you (it’s inescapable that some
part of your worldview will slip into every character but
you don’t want them all to be nothing but slices of your
personality)
In creating a character you’re creating a carefully crafted
personality construct a model of a nonexistent person
It’s more profitable to imagine the ways your character
would respond to a situation that are different from your
own responses along the same axes of personality that their
core character is different from yours — even if it doesn’t
seem empathetic

For example if your character is a soldier scouting enemy
territory and you’re a dog lover your soldier character
will still snap the neck of the guard dog that threatens to
give away his presence If you put yourself in that
situation you might waste time trying to sneak around the
dog or knock it unconscious — but that’s not the right
approach for a professional soldier character

You actually have to imagine how your character would feel
based on the core personality traits and goals you’ve given
that character not just try to find actions for them you
find empathetic (unless of course that particular
character is one you empathize with)

Ultimately what this rule is about is driving the story
forward through character reactions to situations which
result in emotionally consistent characters not giving
them responses that are merely convenient actions to take
for you to make each individual scene “work”
(mechanically)

If your characters’ actions lack emotional honesty the
audience will stop caring about them at which point they
also stop caring about your plot no matter how “clever” it
may be
Rule 16

What are the stakes Give us reason to root
for the character What happens if they
don’t succeed Stack the odds against

This particular rule is so essential it probably should be
rule 1 because it is the most character-centric statement
of the idea “what is the story about”

What the character will lose if she is unable to overcome
all obstacles internal and external is the main tension
line of the entire story It’s this impending possibility
of loss that will make an audience sympathetic to a
character even one who is a bit of a bastard The stakes
are the core of the story the palpable outcome of failing
to resolve the central question

Stacking the odds against the protagonist makes the
audience not only feel more empathy towards her but it
also makes a victory feel earned (or in the case of a
tragedy a failure feel justified)

A common question producers and other professionals ask
about stories is “why this particular character in this
particular situation at this particular time” What they’re
really asking is “what are the stakes”

The protagonist’s flaw her wrong choices the actions of
any external opponents and all the external circumstances
should be obstacles that block or divert the protagonist
from resolving the central question in their favor
Internal obstacles — character flaws and the bad decisions
they lead to — are also crucial

Yet the protagonist however flawed still needs to be
deeply invested in her own success so that the audience
cares not only about that victory itself but also about
her being able to change in the ways necessary to win

So the more the protagonist has to lose the more the
audience will get invested in her fate And the greater the
obstacles to success the more likely she is to lose

Each step the character takes away from success and
towards the doom scenario raises the stakes and makes the
audience more excited about getting to the resolution So
does broadening the risk a common melodramatic example of
which is the protagonist discovering that not only will she
die if she fails but “life as we know it will cease”

Active intelligent opponents are usually the most
compelling obstacles and they work best when they have
opposing stakes Opponents need to be equally as invested
in their own success as the protagonist is and therefore
determined to bring about the protagonist’s failure in
order to achieve their own goals

Most importantly the opponents need to have the advantage
If the advantage is too great the protagonist needs to
acquire allies in order to make a successful outcome (if
there is one) believable but it’s far worse for the
dramatic tension if the opponents are too weak to pose a
credible threat to the protagonist

This is a particular problem with “hack n’ slash” action
films where sheer numbers of dumb aimless weak opponents
tries (usually quite unsuccessfully) to make-up for an
intelligent driven strong central opponent

Quantity alone doesn’t make the odds greater opposing
strength does If a single soldier in a Sherman Tank goes
up against a thousand Roman legionnaires the audience
won’t be terribly concerned about that tanker’s fate
despite the number of opponents

But if a single Roman legionnaire goes up against a squad
of Sherman Tanks the odds are very much stacked against
the Roman and an audience will be intrigued to find out if
he’ll somehow prevail (or given most audience members’
exposure to story trends in our culture how he’1l
prevail)

It’s also important that how the character overcomes these
seemingly insurmountable odds be motivated by that
character’s personality take advantage of her strengths
and be plausible -- not necessarily realistic but
believable and consistent with the story world you’ve
created

Making the character’s victory (or defeat) too sudden
spurious or simple will undermine all the tension you’ve
worked to create up to that point wiping it all away in
one bad choice The victory moment must be a struggle and
a narrow victory is generally more sympathetic than an
overwhelming one (of course there are exceptions)

Keeping that tension going until the very moment of the
protagonist’s victory will enable the audience to stay on
board with the character until her plight is ultimately
resolved The moment things start going overwhelmingly in
favor of the protagonist there’s only a moment left before
the audience will just sigh and say “okay I get it she’s
going to prevail”

And if the protagonist will be defeated in the end the
audience will feel the tragedy more acutely if there was a
moment of true hope she might prevail rather than just
mowing her down with overwhelming opposing forces

Ultimately the stakes are the heart of both story and
character and without clearly stating what they are the
audience will become lost and disaffected

Even worse if you don’t know what the stakes are you will
end up creating a story that is muddled and just kills time
until its conclusion

This is why a lot of writing advice says to start at the
end all the conflict in the story flows backwards from the
resolution of the stakes question Knowing the conclusion
of the story and how the protagonist and opponent are each
changed in the end will enable you to make sure that every
moment in the story is a building block towards resolving
the stakes not “just business”
Rule 17

No work is ever wasted If it’s not working
let go and move on - it’1l come back around
to be useful later

This is great motivational advice It may seem pithy but
ignore it at your own peril Being unable to let go has
caused many an artist to never progress

However there is also a bit of “artists’ dream” thinking
that has slipped into the phrasing through no fault of the
advice giver (we all do it) I’ll pick this apart so that
you can approach taking this advice with “the spirit of the
law not the letter”

Work is never wasted because in order to find the right
ideas for your story you have to try out ideas on the page
and then refine excise and add to them

As has come up before in this series the best ideas come
from trying whatever ideas feel right at the time and then
seeing if they work not by trying the first thing you
think will work and then sticking with it forever

To paraphrase the famous writing-specific quote so that it
applies to all phases of all arts

All vision is revision

Furthermore practicing your craft whether it’s writing or
another art is experience

And experience doesn’t come from (thinking you are) getting
it right every time Experience comes from learning to
identify when something you’re doing isn’t working
troubleshooting the reasons why and trying out options to
solve the problem

You absolutely must learn to figure out what isn’t working
let it go and move on And you need to really let go even
though it won’t necessarily come back around to be useful
later

Lying to yourself about what letting go means which many
writers and artists are prone to do isn’t very helpful It
can lead to getting lost in thoughts about when and where
that favorite excised idea is going to come back around and
be useful It may never do so

Holding out hope that all ideas are good ideas if only you
find the right place for them is a waste of time If the
idea is the right idea for some other section of the piece
or some future draft or even some entire other story —
youll think of it then

If it isn’t ever useful again anywhere else it still
wasn’t wasted work It was something you needed to try in
order to find what was right and there’s no shame or waste
in that

Of course many artists keep discarded (or “stalled”) idea
bins I do But the trick is to approach how you think
about the contents of that bin in the right way Those are
just scraps that might be useful or inspirational
sometime when you get stuck or are just “riffing”

There should be no self-imposed mandate to use them
“someday” and no feeling you wasted your time creating
them if they never emerge from the bin Some things just
aren’t meant to be

Keep the ideas flowing and don’t worry about what winds up
in the bin Whether or not it comes back to be useful
someday you’re still a better artist for having gone
through the process of creating it in the first place
Rule 18

You have to know yourself the difference
between doing your best and fussing Story is
testing not refining

Knowing yourself is absolutely essential Its the
difference between doing your best and not just fussing
but ultimately getting stuck and giving up

The difference between doing your best and fussing over
small details at the cost of the big picture can be very
subtle and while it ultimately does all come down to
knowing yourself there are some general warning signs to
look out for

If you’ve spent a lot more time than average on a single
page that probably is a sign that you’ve gotten mired in
the details (if you haven’t figured out your own average
yet more than an hour at a sitting is a good starter rule
of thumb for “too much time on one page”)

When this happens just keep going If you haven’t solved
it in the usual amount of time then what you most likely
need is time spent not thinking about the problem
consciously rather than more time ratholing

It’s also a problem if you’re rewriting dialog and
description over and over to “perfection” or any other
sort of “polish” work when you still haven’t finished the
overall story changes you’ve identified as being necessary
for the draft at hand

You can make all those details “perfect” once the character
arcs thematic threads and plot mechanics are firing on
all cylinders

Even dialog and action just need to be “the right idea” in
order to work out those high-level mechanics to the point
where the story actually is engaging emotional and
“right”

The nuanced subtextual writing can come in revisions once
the big picture is painted

If you’re “just thinking” for a longer than average time
then you’re probably worried about doing something “wrong”
with a story point you’re not sure about You need to just
do the wrong thing and fix it later

When you’re stuck since you’ve already written something
for all the previous parts of the story there’s a good
chance that something that comes later will inspire the
solution to what you’re fussing over But you can’t find
that thing unless you write past the current problem and
get into the rest of the story

My mantra about this is “be wrong early and often” You
can’t fix something in revision if there’s nothing to
revise

And finally if you find yourself spending more than a
moment on time of day character names what people are
wearing location dressing details models of cars or guns
or computers or anything very specific like that — you’re
totally stuck and have to force yourself to reengage with
the hard work of making story progress that you’re
avoiding

None of those kinds of details really matter at all
they’re just an amusing distraction from the hard stuff
(The rare exception is when it’s crucial and I mean “the
story completely falls apart without it” crucial not
“nailing all the details makes me feel smart” pseudo-
crucial)

The second part of this piece of advice deserves to have
been a separate rule since it’s an idea unto itself Even
if you know yourself and understand the difference between
doing your best and fussing you can still run into
trouble Because even if you’re doing it well and doing it
efficiently you can still end up doing the wrong thing at
the wrong time

Packing the idea into half a Tweet also led to a phrasing
that can really lead inexperienced storytellers into
trouble because they don’t necessarily understand what a
Pixar person means when they say “story” It’s using a
shorthand with implied meaning that you may not all get so
I’1ll unpack it for you in order to help you make best use
of the advice

This phrase uses a distinction between “story” meaning
story development and “production” meaning implementation
in which those involved in the “story” process are creating
all the high-level elements (broad characterizations
themes arcs plot points sequences) and those involved
in the “production” process are refining the details
(dialog action settings moments and scenes)

“Story” meaning “story development” is the process of
conceiving structuring sketching (drawn or written) and
testing ideas During that phase of the process everything
is rough and the few details added in are intended only to
support the main ideas and everything is subject to change
at any moment through inspiration or analysis

So therefore what’s meant by “story is testing not
refinement” is that when you’re working out the basic
structures themes and characterizations of your piece you
have to focus on the big picture and test ideas in rough
form to see if they work at all not get caught-up in the
details by refining the details to “perfection”

But once the story starts to lock into place the process
of refinement starts Dialog description and action are
rewritten and restaged sets are designed and dressed and
so on

This “iterative refinement” approach working from rough to
fine is actually an ideal approach for every phase of
every artform Within film production for example all the
different artistic disciplines use the sketch first test
and review decide then refine approach for creating their
own work

Getting into the refinement details during the story
development process bogs you down and often makes you
precious about the refined ideas which gets in the way of
testing ideas In story development you need to not be
precious about anything because you’1ll be throwing away
even great ideas that just don’t work for that particular
story

Finding the problems before you dig into the details makes
it much easier to make the necessary revisions not just
because you won’t be precious about things but because
sticking to the big picture first means there will also be
fewer dangling threads to track across each revision

Once you get into rewriting then you need to stay focused
on only what’s most important for your story even during
refinement If it’s not important to the story it’s just
taking up space that should be used by something that is

Overall the crux of this advice is this figure out the
overarching structural and thematic elements of your story
first and test those in a non-precious sketch form until
you’ve found something that seems to work best Then refine
it And always focus on what’s important the other details
are just clutter
Rule 19

Coincidences to get characters into trouble
are great coincidences to get them out of
it are cheating

There is a gem of excellent advice in this rule in drama
everything works best if protagonist motivation choice and
action drives her into and out of trouble Period

All coincidences are suboptimal Yet they also appear to a
certain degree in every story

When they’re used to get characters into trouble they’re
simply more forgivable because the audience gets wrapped-up
in the new conflict and consequences When they are used to
get a character out of trouble the result is a deflation of
tension and the audience having time to pause and reflect
upon how cheated they feel that a tense moment was resolved
by fate rather than character choice

Coincidences to get characters into trouble will be
forgiven so long as the audience is emotionally invested in
the character since thats what will get them on board
with the new conflict and less concerned with how it arose

But you cant do this too clumsily too often or worst of
all in a way that undermines the audiences interest in the
character

Like any illusionist if you show your hand too clearly the
audience will see the trick where otherwise they might just
relax and enjoy the show

Glaringly clumsy coincidences even to get the character
into trouble are the stuff of parody such as having a hero
say I wish the cops would get here and a second later a
ring of cops rushes in and points their guns at the hero
rather than the villain In that scene the writer did use
coincidence to put the hero into peril and increase the
stakes but in such an obvious way the audience will see
the trick rather than enjoy the magic

Likewise if every turn of the tension ratchet is done by
accident the audience will soon tire of it
People empathize with someone who gets in trouble because
try as they may to do the right thing their actions keep
blowing up in their faces

Audiences are generally less enthusiastic about someone who
is passively dragged into conflict by other characters’
actions and accidents of time and place The very rare
exceptions involve clever uses of that trope to comedic or
paranoiac effect (and even then the audience still wants
at least some of those coincidences to be the result of
the bungling protagonist trying to find a way out of the
consequence machine theyve gotten trapped in)

Even if youre using your coincidences sparingly a poor
choice regarding the specifics of a coincidence can
undermine what the audience most likes about the character
and cause them to disengage This is especially true if the
choice undermines a character personality trait rather than
merely a skill

For example if you have a character who youve been
setting up as a braggart and then put them in a situation
where their bragging should get them into more trouble but
instead you push them into trouble through a coincidence --
youve just blown it

Lets say you have a tough talking petty crook who gets
called before a mafia boss The audience wants his bragging
about his toughness to get him into some kind of trouble
here such as the boss taking his brag at face value and
sending him on a hit

But if you choose instead to have the boss give a hitman a
job and say take one of my boys just as your petty crook
walks in and the hitman says you come on -- you just

gave the moment a hapless character deserves to a braggart

By doing so you’ve undermined an interesting trait that

engaged your audience with the character Not paying off
that character set-up probably just lost them for good

even though you only did it once

Coincidences to get characters out of trouble are cheating
especially if the coincidence precludes character driven
action

If a character is randomly ambushed by an armed opponent
scrambles to take cover is chased down cornered and then
before your hero can even draw her weapon the assailant is
hit by a bus -- thats not satisfying The hero didnt get
to take any action not even something that led them into
the coincidental situation

But if a character takes an action that leads to a
coincidental situation youre getting back into forgivable
territory This starts to feel more like good luck than
total coincidence

In fact set-ups and pay-offs are basically just chains of
coincidence earlier in the film you establish something
seemingly unrelated to the rest of the plot and later it
happens to be exactly what the protagonist needs

For example lets say in a cop thriller you establish that
theres a beekeeping convention in the downtown convention
center this coming weekend

Later coincidentally the hero finds out that a villain is
allergic to bees

Later still as the villain is closing in on the hero and
seems about ready to win the hero remembers the convention
and in a last ditch effort to escape certain defeat she
diverts the action into the convention center She kicks
over the bee boxes and lets the bees do her work for her

Its coincidence that there were bees and a bee-allergic
villain in the same cop story at the same time to begin
with never mind that the action happened to take place on
bee convention weekend But the audience will (if its done
with enough finesse) potentially consider it clever rather
than coincidental because a character choice closed the
loop

Set-ups and payoffs are one of a dramatists greatest
tools Getting away with the coincidences needed to make
them work is all about how much care and finesse you us in
constructing them

You really can only ever get away with coincidences when a
notable protagonist choice has led her straight into them
Though its often better to have choice and action lead to
direct consequence instead sometimes a clever well-
constructed chain of motivated coincidence works best
Like with coincidences to get a character into trouble the
ones to get them out are most egregious if theyre too
obvious too frequent or poorly timed and staged such that
they undermine character moments

The most infamous example of this happens when the clumsy
coincidence comes during the conclusion of the story a
problem so egregious yet so common it has its own term of
art Deus Ex Machina

The term translates to God In The Machine and basically
means some invisible external actor (ultimately the
writer) solves all the protagonists problems for them

Many otherwise interesting stories have been completely
ruined by Deus Ex Machina conclusions in which the main
character is removed from the central action of the climax
by outside actors solving everything for them

A particularly infamous and frustrating example of this is
the computer entity actually named Deus Ex Machina in The
Matrix Revolutions a literal God in the literal machine
swoops in and solves all of Neos problems for him

When the coincidence actually resolves the entire story a
nod towards character action motivating it just isnt good
enough Drama is dramatic because protagonists save the day
when God cant get the job done (or die trying ina
tragedy) not the other way around

In essence what this rule is trying to say is that your
protagonists motivations choices and actions should
always be what gets them into and out of trouble and any
coincidences involved need to be motivated by those
decisions
Rule 20

Exercise take the building blocks of a
movie you dislike How’d you rearrange them
into what you DO like

This is a great exercise that I do all the time often ina
group session with the filmmaking team Ive been working
with for the last three years in order to hone overall
story analysis and troubleshooting skills

Its not a rule or piece of advice specific to defining
your own working approach or solving a common creative
problem but its a fun and informative exercise to do
whenever you see a bad film

Picking a part a movie you dont like and trying to fix it
makes you realize what you do and dont like about story
what works and doesnt work for you and how you
troubleshoot those things

Its a great exercise because it gets you thinking about
editing which is something a lot of writers and directors
dont think enough about (Though frankly writers
shouldnt think about it at all until theyve written the
first draft that gets all the ideas down so theres
something to work with in editing)

Figuring out whats working and what isnt and what you
think needs to be taken out rearranged or added in order
to fix problems and enhance the drama is an absolutely
essential filmmaking still

Another great benefit to this exercise is that by trying to
troubleshoot someone elses film you begin to realize how
difficult it can be to find solutions which will teach you
patience when it comes to analyzing and fixing your own
stories

But there are many other equally useful story and writing
exercises out there that get you thinking about other
neglected aspects of the craft It seems a shame to limit
it to this one so here are some other enjoyable useful
exercises that will help you refine story skills

Open the newspaper and write a story about the first
article you find What things about the original
article that grabbed your attention when they were
real did you have to modify in order to make the
dramatic fiction work

Take a movie you do like study a scene between your
two favorite characters and then write an entirely
different scene between those two characters In order
to find each characters voice how much did you have
to pay attention to word choice cadence and tone
versus point of view and personality

Write down everything you think you know about your
favorite character from your favorite movie Then
watch it and see where you learn that information
whats in the set-up what is explicitly stated in
dialog later and what youve inferred from actions
and reading between the lines of the dialog

Take a movie you do like and try to improve it What
things dont you like that you forgive but given the
chance would remove or improve More importantly is
there anything you like that could be cut or reworked
in order to make the story better

Stop a movie about 15 minutes in and write down all
the things you see as negatives about the main
character Do most of them resolve into positives by
the end of the film If not was it a struggle to
enjoy the film -- and if not why

Take a movie you do like and re-outline it from
another characters point of view What changed and
what didnt How much of the new POV character existed
in the original and how much did you have to make up
What did you do with the original protagonist

The exercise in rule twenty and the others I suggest
above are some of the best exercises that involve
analyzing someone elses work

There are tons of other story exercises out there as well
Not just analytical ones but also various preparatory
exercises involving exploring your own characters and world
in order to get you ready for first and revision drafts

You can find more exercises in various books and websites
Rule 21

You gotta identify with your situation
characters cant just write ‘cool What
would make YOU act that way

This good advice is a rephrasing of rule fifteens If you
were your character in this situation how would you feel
Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations but
with a more explicit suggestion to put yourself in your
characters shoes So I have similar quibbles with how the
phrasing could lead some readers to counterproductive
conclusions

Regarding the idea that all your characters be identifiable
and that you answer the questions about their actions based
on how youd act I refer back to my analysis of rule
fifteen You actually have to imagine how your character
would feel based on the core personality traits and goals
you’ve given that character not just try to find actions
for them you find empathetic

What you most need to do is understand your characters and
situations Not just in a mechanical I did a lot of
research sense but in an emotional sense

Some characters are your own proper avatars and you
identify with them completely Others are fantasy
extensions of a part of yourself or something you wish you
were Those sorts of characters are natural to identify
with

Still others are cautionary tale pathetic versions of
yourself or something you fear you could become Those are
easy to empathize with

But if those are the only characters you write youll
eventually end up in a rut

Of course you always want to write what you know by
playing to your core thematic -- the kinds of stories you
are naturally inclined to tell -- but you want to vary
things by setting them in unfamiliar situations populated
by characters that arent necessarily all some modified
version of yourself
With those types of characters its not so much a matter of
identifying or even empathizing with them but rather with
understanding who they are and creating believable scenes
based on how that character would act

Fulfilling that goal includes creating situations that make
sense for that character to have gotten into based on their
goals and flaws and ways out that draw upon the
characters strengths and needs

What constitutes an inappropriate situation may also not be
obvious It may seem that a soldier forced to dance ballet
is inappropriate but that may be exactly what that
particular soldier needs to do at some point in his
character arc Merely incongruous situations arent
necessarily wrong

And an action that is emotionally dishonest at one point in
a character’s arc may be essential at another point The
whole point of character drama is to put a protagonist
through some sort of ordeal that changes them (or they die
trying in a tragedy) which means the situations that feel
emotionally honest will change with the character

For example a narcissist acting in a self-deprecating
manner seems like it’d never be right But if her arc has
her going from narcissistic to humble yet still self-
confident then her being self-deprecating may very well be
crucial during the low point but if it happens at any
other time in the story it will feel wrong

Audiences identify with situations when they can believe
that the characters in the scene would be in that given
predicament at that point in time

Its a matter of constantly tracking not only your plot
but also your character arc as it relates to your thematic
question and making sure they reconcile

Finally there is the matter of dont write cool This
doesnt mean you can never have a character that is a
hipster or a hepcat (depending on your time period)

Rather it is referring to the mistake of writing vapid
characters in an attempt to meet a surface expectation of
what an exciting character is In other words trying to
get your audience to say wow that guy is cool rather
than really feeling for the character
Cool characters are ones who are emotionally dishonest by
virtue of being straight stereotypes rather than specific
people designed around archetypes

Mediocre action movies often have this problem in the form
of the ultra-capable hero whose only flaw is his regret
that he couldnt save all the good guys the last time he
was called to duty

But the romantic comedy stereotype of the super-competent
ice queen who just needs the right man to melt her heart is
just as much a lazy cool character

You have to strive to create characters and situations that
are both cool in the entertainment value sense (as
determined by your genre) yet emotionally honest and
therefore emotionally compelling
Rule 22

Whats the essence of your story Most
economical telling of it If you know that
you can build out from there

This absolutely crucial piece of advice may seem like it is
just a restating of rule sixteen (which is also related to
rule three) or perhaps it seems like a generalization of
the schema in rule four

In some sense it really is a restating of rule sixteen in
that the stakes a key to the essence of the story If you
dont know the stakes (which in order to do you must also
know your character arcs and theme) you dont have the
essence of your story

And the variations on the story spine presented in my
analysis of rule four can be an excellent way to express
the essence of your story

However the most useful way to think about this rule is
about is to ask

Whats your story pitch

Too many writers (myself included for many years) look down
on the pitch as merely a crass sales tool something that
producers make us do because they are cruel and heartless
titans of industry who just dont understand our artistic
souls But this is the wrong way to think about the pitch
(and the wrong way to think about producers)

The (roughly) two minute teaser pitch is exactly what
this rule is telling you to come up with That is the most
economical telling of the essence of your story

A good pitch strips-away the inessential details no matter
how great those details may be and refines the entire
story down to its compelling essentials

¢ Title and genre

Who the story is about (the protagonist)

Where and when the story takes place (the setting)
Her want and how it isnt met (the core conflict)
The plot outcome if the protagonist fails (the
external stakes)

Her need and what will happen if it isnt realized
(the internal stakes)

What about her character and philosophy is being
tested (the thematic question or philosophical stakes)

The most crucial turning points in the story (the
inciting incident the midpoint twistkicker and the
low point)

The final resolution (of the plot character arc and
thematic question)

And it does this in about three sentences

(Note People very frequently confuse a pitch with a
logline which is just one sentence and is all about
conveying the conceptual hook in hopes of getting someone
interested in hearing the short pitch and then hopefully
the longer pitch A logline isnt the most economical
telling of your story its just a statement of the core
concept)

To pitch a story in three sentences a lot of set-up gets
left out and some of those essential elements are conveyed
more through subtext or implication than direct statement
For example

Blade Runner is a future noir in which Deckard an
ex-cop once known for hunting rogue androids is
dragged out of retirement when a murderous group of
military androids shows up in his city intent on
forcing their designer to extend their short
lifespans

But what Deckard least expected was to fall in love
with an android Rachel and as he hunts the rogues
Deckard begins to question his own humanity and
theirs

In his dogged pursuit Deckard drives away Rachel and
is nearly killed by the dying rogue leader Roy -- but
a moment of mutual empathy between man and android
earns Deckard a second chance at a life and love

Whether or not you think my pitch is the best possible
pitch for Blade Runner and whether or not you agree with
my take on the frequently debated outcome and theme of the
film lets look at the pitch to see how it tells you the
essence of the story

¢ The phrases future noir and his city explain the
genre and setting

Deckard is stated to be the protagonist

The characters want to be left alone and the
conflict of being thrust back into the role of hunter
is summed-up in the phrase dragged out of
retirement

The external stakes are implicit in the phrase
murderous group of military androids and extend

their short lifespans these killing machine could
become gods among men and avenge themselves upon all
humanity

The internal stakes involve Deckards humanity and his
love affair with Rachel which Deckard will win out
the hunter or the lover

The thematic question is what does it mean to be
human and in the pitch it is presented as the
phrase questions his own humanity -- and theirs

The turning points are hes dragged back to hunt down
the rogues (inciting incident) he meets Rachel and
falls for her (midpoint twist) and he loses her and
is nearly killed (low point)

The resolution is that Roy dies and Deckard lives
(plot) but now Deckard has found his humanity
(character) and the audience understands what it means
to be human in the first place -- its not your
origins its your character (theme)

When preparing to write (or rewrite) your own story you
dont necessarily need to phrase the distillation of the
essence of your story as bullet points a modified story
spine or even as a three sentence pitch (though writing it
as a pitch will help you later when you go to sell it or
get people on-board to help make it)

How you choose to explore ideas and write down your
summation is entirely up to you

But you do need to nail-down all of those elements at that
level of specificity and be able to clearly state them to
yourself as the foundation for creating a definitive draft
of your story
Of course for a work in progress all this may get revised
with each draft

As part of each revision you should re-state those things
to yourself with the changes clearly spelled-out This will
make creating the rest of the story a lot easier because
youll know where your story is going and who the
character is thats taking it there
Conclusion

The conclusion to my analysis of Pixars 22 Rules of
Story is not a summary but rather one last thought about
story drawn from the response to the original list itself

I was inspired to write the analysis because a number of
people latched onto the original tweets as the codification
of a hard-and-fast set of rules for the proper way to
craft stories And the weight of Pixar brand seems to have
caused many to take these tidbits as The Truth about
storytelling

The intimidating notion that Pixar had laid down the law of
craft for storytellers everywhere has overwhelmed the
original intention of the Tweets to share some
observations and guidelines in order to get people thinking
about various important storytelling concepts

But story development is a difficult messy process and the
idea that its elements could be fully legislated in twenty-
two short sentences is at best wishful thinking

Each topic in the list was calling out for clarification
and deeper consideration than a sound bite medium like
Twitter affords

But the success of the Tweets does illustrate one important
idea quite clearly people are drawn to compelling ideas
concisely stated

My own more in-depth analyses are moored in the original
statements and make use of additional concise statements
to grab the readers attention and direct them from idea to
idea

Thats exactly how you structure any story

A series of simple hooks followed by details that enrich
and deepen the original idea enticing your audience to
keep taking each next step along the path from premise to
conclusion

Ultimately my own analyses are themselves intended to get
you thinking about the enumerated aspects of storytelling
presented in the series not as the be-all and end-all of
story doctrine
Ive also shared some tips and techniques lessons and
observations Each one is something that Ive learned from
my Pixar and non-Pixar mentors and collaborators and
through trial and error

Some of my ideas and approaches may click with you and
integrate perfectly into your storytelling practice and
some wont

But every one is a personal truth Ive arrived at in my
storytelling career ones that I apply every day in
crafting my stories They’re not part of some theoretical
construct So hopefully you will at least find each one
useful as food for thought

Please share this series with every one of your
storytelling friends I wrote it so everyone who crafts
narratives -- screenwriters playwrights novelists poets
songwriters directors actors etc -- could get more in-
depth with these Pixar rules and find something that
helps them express themselves more fully through their art
Bonus Chapter

Bugaj’s Five Rules for Writers

This bonus chapter is mainly drawn from another blog post I
wrote about my “rules” for writing

Writing people claim is the most personal of the arts
Yet it seems everybody has a bunch of rules for you to
follow about how to do it their way

In fact coming up with a set of rules about how to be a
writer seems to be as important a part of convincing people
youre a “real” writer as actually writing things (In
fact a number of people skip the writing career part and
settle right into careers writing and promoting sets of
rules)

There are as many sets of rules for writers as there are
writers and screenwriting is particularly amenable to
people coming up with rules and formulas for how to do it

“Sound bite” rules for anything are always insufficient
The more detailed thought and analysis that the quips are
intended to provoke is crucial to understanding

And there are legions books dedicated to in-depth
screenwriting rules templates and formulas The famous
Robert McKee “Story” book Syd Field’s “Screenplay” Blake
Snyder’s “Save The Cat” Richard Walter and Lew Hunter
representing UCLA’s approach David Howard and Paul Gullio
bringing you the USC rules Christopher Vogler channeling
Joseph Campbell William Goldman eschewing pedagogy and
focusing on funny anecdotes Linda Seger and John Truby and
many others promoting their consultancies and so on

I’ve read pretty much every piece of writing pedagogy
that’s in print in the English language and two things are
very clear to me

1 In general everyone says the same thing

2 In particular everyone pitches you their own personal
style

Unfortunately nobody but you can figure out which of the
particulars work for you Do you only find inspiration when
writing in red sharpie on butcher’s paper Did an adjective
kill your parents when you were a child and now you’ve
sworn revenge upon them for all time Must every paragraph
you write contain the word “burrito” Only you can figure
those things out about yourself

But the generalities can be summarized and people do enjoy
concise statements of “greater truths” about things So
I’ve put down my thoughts about what the simplest most
overarching rules for writers are And by doing so I will
not only potentially save you hundreds of dollars on books
and classes and template software (I kid you’re going to
buy all that stuff anyway) but I will also establish
street cred as a “real” writer — one with rules and
everything

1 Write what interests you If you don’t like your idea
very much nobody else will either Writing something
because it’s what’s cool or commercial when you’re not
really into it won’t get you a sale it’1ll cause you to
waste your time writing bad work because you don’t care
about it enough to make it great

2 Don’t be boring Since I am first and foremost a
screenwriter I also call this my “Zero Act Structure
Theory” because too many novices interpret structure
teachings that focus on certain key moments to mean you can
half-ass all the other moments Wrong Every moment needs
to be interesting and have a clear (to you) reason for
being in the story — not just the “important ones” In
other words if you know something is filler so will the
audience

3 Be concise Writers professional readers and writing
pedagogues love to have opinions about specific ways to do
this (Elmore Leonard’s rules are all nit picks around this
point for example) But rules about details are matters of
style and personality not just yours but that of each
individual story and character The main point is to say
exactly what needs to be said and no more Exactly what
that is must be determined on a case-by-case basis

4 Always take critique rarely take advice Even other
“better” writers don’t know how to write what you want to
say in your personal style but even the least
sophisticated audience member can clue you in to when
you’re not succeeding You also need to be smart about your
analysis of the critique — as often as not the bit someone
says isn’t working is fine it’s a related set-up or pay-
off that’s missing or botched And don’t be defensive about
hearing critique Even if someone is a complete jerk about
how they tell you what they aren’t connecting with in your
writing try to learn from the critique anyway (Then never
ask that person to critique your work again — a cruel
attitude about giving feedback is never warranted)

5 Write rewrite then finish Write as often as possible
There is a lot of specific advice out there about how to
compel oneself to do that egg timers solitude only using
pencil heavy drinking I feel that writing frequently
often comes down to this either you need to rearrange your
schedule and drop some commitments because you using your
time and energy elsewhere or you need to accept that “the
first draft of anything is shit” and not waste all your
time trying to write perfect first drafts Finishing comes
down to accepting that “the perfect is the enemy of the
good” and being able to just stop when you realize you’re
just making changes and not making anything better

There you go those are my “five rules for writers”

All are sufficiently vague that there’s no point in anyone
taking issue with any of them

Unfortunately vague rules are the only types of creative
rules that are universal Everything else comes from self-
knowledge and thousands of hours of practice

And those rules do seem utterly devoid of any suggestions
about how to do those things

But that’s not quite true The only two things all writers
must do is stated quite clearly write often and seek out
people to critique your work That’s how you do it

Whatever other rules and methodologies you experiment with
the artistic growth that actually gets you anywhere is
coming from those two things

Finally notice that this advice also applies to pretty
much any creative discipline In fact I apply the same
basic rules to filmmaking music production CGI writing
software and photography (which for me are interconnected
practices anyway)

friendly action drama This role was the result of
mentoring with various Pixar heads of story and directors
starting in 2004

My twelve years of experience at Pixar Animation Studios in
various production roles have also given me extensive
expertise in most aspects of feature production from
concept development through production

To Akron” a dramedy and “Desert Maelstrom” a military
horror story have placed in numerous contests most notably
“Welcome To Akron” in the Nichol Fellowship competition
and “Let The Games Begin” at Austin Film Festival

And the first book of a philosophical sci-fi graphic novel
miniseries I wrote for indie publisher Whamix is currently
being inked

My other passions are technology photography and
photomanipulation music production and video art Ive
done some for-hire work in these areas but most of my art
and music projects are self-directed Youll find examples
of both on this site
