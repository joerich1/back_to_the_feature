MARYANNE (VO)
Hold still

INT STEWART HOUSE - NIGHT

MARYANNE STEWART is twenty-two she has a plain beauty to
her freckles hair gathered in a bun Her face is underlit
by the candle she uses to heat a needle She’s holding the
hand of her LITTLE BROTHER age 6 about to remove a splinter
from his finger She blows on the needle to cool it

MARYANNE
A splinter already hurts more than
pulling it out

Little Brother tries to be brave but he’s nervous Pinned
to her dress at Maryanne’s throat is a silver BROOCH an
intricate Celtic pattern interwoven with a yellow ribbon

In the small rough-hewn cabin behind her we see Maryanne’s
heavy-set BIG BROTHER LITTLE SISTER and MOTHER
(50’s) They’re settling for the night cleaning the dinner
dishes getting the kids into their nightshirts etc

YOUNGER SISTER
I’m not sleepy

MOTHER
Well story you to bed
(to Maryanne-)
You need to take your rest too
Mary F’you wanna look pretty when
your Dutchman comes courtin’
tomorrow

MARYANNE
You hush

Maryanne smiles lowers the needle towards her brother’s
finger

BIG BROTHER
He told daddy he was saving wages
for his own settlement

Little Brother squirms watching the needle approach

MARYANNE
I only just met him He ain’t

The pin-point approaches young skin
CRACK CRACK CRACK rapid rifle fire sounds from outside
The whole family’s attention snaps towards the sound They
freeze for a moment spooked like animals

Big Brother moves first cracks the shutter on a window In
silvery moonlight we catch a glimpse of waving prairie
grass MUZZLE-FLASHES with the CRACKS of rifle fire

There’s a FIGURE running fast approaching the house
Maryanne sticks the needle in the candle and puts a

protective arm around Little Brother Little Sister nuzzles
into her mother’s arms frightened

LITTLE SISTER
Mom

BAM everybody jumps when he hits the door yanking it open a
moment later to reveal Maryanne’s heavy FATHER (50’s) He’s
breathless terrified a rifle in his hand CRACK CRACK
distant rifle-fire continues from the cabin behind him

MOTHER
What’s happening

FATHER (BREATHLESS )
They were in the Williams’ house

BIG BROTHER
Indians

Big Brother grabs a rifle off the wall steps towards his
father who puts a hand on his shoulder

FATHER
Stay with the women Down into
the root cellar Get

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

The settlement is two small clapboard homes alone in an ocean
of grass stirred by heavy winds From the Stewart House we
see Maryanne and her family hurrying out of the back door and
down into a cellar

INT STEWART HOUSE CELLAR - NIGHT

Her father ushers Maryanne down the stairs where her mother
and sisters wait with a lantern Her brother follows after
a rifle in hand Father lifts the doors above-
FATHER
Keep your lamp low and this door
locked You don’t open it no
matter what You hear

Brother nods as he shuts the door

YOUNGER SISTER
Dad

BROTHER
Quiet

YOUNGER SISTER (PANICKING)
Mom mom

MOTHER
You mind your brother Hush

Big Brother latches the storm doors shut and backs into the
middle of the cellar He takes the lamp from his mother and
turns the flame down low

We hear muffled SHOUTS above movement The little children
in their white nightshirts are crying holding onto their
mother The adults all look up at the underside of the
floorboards eyes glassy with fear

Maryanne shakes her head at her Little Brother’s tears and
wipes at his cheek In a whisper barely more than silence-

MARYANNE
Don’t cry Be brave for me

She holds his gaze until he takes a breath and nods

The cellar around them is cluttered filled with burlap sacks
of grain half-mended farm tools Lamplight throws weaving
shadows on the walls around them

CRACK CRACK more rifle shots and then a man’s SCREAM
Maryanne puts a hand to her mouth Brother tightens his fist
on the rifle Mother holds the two crying children

Relative SILENCE above The family stands frozen trying not
to breathe Little Brother SNIFFS and all heads snap towards
the sound Mother puts a gentle hand over his mouth pleads
with her eyes for quiet

Something DRAGS over the floorboards above The family looks
upwards terrified SCCCCRRRRT the dragging sounds like a
carpet knife over the rough boards
BOOM a muffled shotgun blast Then BOOM another The
family all look upwards from the dragging sound to- BOOM a
third blast and a fourth

All of the adults fail to notice what both of the crying
children see- a silhouetted FIGURE in the shadows behind Big
Brother low to the ground moving in

Little Brother and Sister draw tiny breaths eyes fixed on
the figure almost too terrified to speak

YOUNGER SISTER (WHISPERING)
--mom

Her mother shushes her The DRAGGING above has stopped
Subtly a dinner plate-sized circle of dirt by Little Brother
begins to move He feels it through his socked foot and
looks Eight inches of soil shake like simmering water
Little Brother looks at his mom who stares upwards at the
floorboards He looks back down Dirt moves outward from
the center of the circle SOMETHING PALE begins to surface
like a boiled worm or the finger of a drowned child
Maryanne Big Brother and Mother all stare upwards

Little Brother looks down at the dirt and inhales to scream

Little Sister looks away from the figure slinking towards Big
Brother and closes her eyes crying terrified

An agonizing moment before-

Big Brother SCREAMS and the lantern drops

Maryanne spins The lantern hits the ground at her brother’s
feet and shatters the momentary flash of firelight revealing
him clawing at the dirt floor as he’s pulled violently back

into the shadows

The light extinguishes leaving pitch darkness Little
Sister SCREAMS We hear YELLING SCREAMS VIOLENCE

Then sudden quiet

There are inhuman RATTLES and PURRS the sounds of bodies
dragged over the ground Soil shifts

SILENCE BLACK ON SCREEN
TITLE
The Dakota Territories
August 15th 1879

DRIPPING Flies BUZZ

A vertical line of light grows into the rectangle of an
opening door silhouetting a FIGURE in a derby and duster
against the lush slowly waving grass of the Dakota plains

INT THE WILLIAMS HOUSE- DAY

The figure moves into the absolute black of the house stark
contrast against the big sky glare of the Badlands He pulls
the derby from his head

Hundreds of specks of darkness FLIES rise in a cloud and
swarm the lighted rectangle of the doorway

The man little more than a dark shape in the sliver of
light is DUTCH a heavily-accented Belgian immigrant two
years off the boat Dutch is sharp capable but out of
place a little anxious in the West

DUTCH (ACCENTED )
-Is anybody home Mr Williams
The Stewarts are

The pupil in the illuminated crescent of Dutchs face widens
adjusting to the dark then narrows

DUTCH
Jesus god

Dutch backs away his boots sliding through a rich crimson
puddle never taking his eyes off the thing before him

At the door he puts his hand against the jamb steadying
himself Theres something small and smooth under his palm

He takes his hand away and looks A TOOTH a molar lodged
in the wood as if fired there Dutch stumbles out and
EXT WASHBURNE CRICK SETTLEMENT-— DAY

-onto the porch nauseated his blood-stained boots losing
purchase on the friction-smoothed boards He flails and

falls into JOHN CLAY

The enormous man catches Dutch Clay is a mountain early
40s easily 6 feet and 250 lbs of John Wayne
All-business all the time he’s a commanding presence
strong an obvious leader Hes holding a black-and-white
PHOTOGRAPH in a broken frame in one of his enormous hands

CLAY
Basement’s empty The Stewarts are
gone Maryanne say anything to you
about leaving

Dutch shakes his head no Clay presses the Stewart family
portrait into Dutchs hands and pushes him off the porch

CLAY
What about the Williams

Dutch shakes his head and points into the dark doorway before
them Clay turns and steps into the Williams House
vanishing into the darkness

We see the settlement in daylight the two clapboard homes
bleached gray from hard weather The surrounding grass sways

We get a better look at Dutch late 20’s lean angular His
body language reads somewhere between Ichabod Crane and
Sherlock contained nervous energy and remarkably sharp eyes

Dutch looks at the photograph Clay gave him The Stewarts
are a large family posed before their home on the Washburne
Crick The children’s images are blurred they moved during
the exposure Dutch scans the faces focusing in on
Maryanne He touches her image smearing blood on the picture
by mistake He grimaces and wipes it clean with his sleeve

The TWO HORSES tied to the fence behind Dutch lift their feet
and roll their eyes nervous

Clay emerges from the door carrying Dutchs Derby as if it
were a pair of discarded panties Dutch takes the hat
theres a crimson stain on the crown

Clay walks to his horse and leans his hands on the saddle
staring out at the slowly waving grass

CLAY
Indians God help them

DUTCH
We have to get them back

Clay nods just barely
EXT THE SPACKS HOUSE- DAY

DOBIE SPACKS walks through the grass looking down lost in
rumination He pinches at his upper lip trying to tweeze
between his thumb and finger the fine down growing there
Dobie will soon be 16 He carries a pitcher of milk Behind
him the Spacks House sits large whitewashed and Victorian
like some Edward Hopper sentinel

Ahead WILLIAM PARCHER follows Dobies mother towards a
thick twisted box elder tree growing on a rise in the land
Parcher is a mischievous-looking rancher in his 50s a
moustache glorious sideburns

Parcher carries a picnic basket He hangs back and whispers
conspiratorially to Dobie-

PARCHER

I hemped three men on yonder tree
DOBIE

Really
PARCHER

Indians anyway Hanged ‘em dead

Parcher winks at Dobie showing off The boy smiles he’s
impressed

GERTRUDE
Dont feed my boy your horse-shit
Mr Parcher

GERTRUDE SPACKS carrying a quilt looks back at them Shes
in her early 50s attractive rich

PARCHER
That aint horse-shit thats
history Boy ought to learn where
we come from

They arrive under the tree and Gertrude spreads the quilt

GERTRUDE
Mind the cursing in front of my
boy

They sit and Parcher begins to take food from the basket
Dobie looks up at the sun through the gnarled branches of the
elder We hear the CREAK of twisting ropes
PARCHER
Great god amighty is that coconut

Parcher pulls a cake from the picnic basket

DOBIE
Mom got it special

GERTRUDE
I baked it The coconut came from
back East

Parcher looks at the cake then at Gertrude

PARCHER
Ten years back not a mile from
here I had to eat horse to
survive

Dobie is impressed

GERTRUDE
Thats disgusting

PARCHER
It wasnt my horse Point is
were here now eating coconut cake
Right civilized country

Parcher cuts himself a slice that encompasses nearly a
quarter of the cake

GERTRUDE
We have chicken and cornbread

PARCHER
I know it Ill attend to that
cornbread directly

Parcher takes an enormous bite of cake smearing his
moustache with icing

DOBIE
Theres a rider

Dobie points Parcher gets to his feet and squints
ON A HORSE gallops towards them half a mile away

PARCHER
Listen cowboy how ‘bout taking
your mother in the house

A MAN
DOBIE
Hes got a funny hat I think its
your ranch-hand Mr Dutch

PARCHER
Anybody can wear a funny hat and
that aint Sunday riding Take
your mother inside

GERTRUDE
Lets go Dobie

Parcher SNAPS the cover guard off of his revolver Dobie
turns and looks Parcher sees the boy eyeing the gun and
grins a little bit

PARCHER
Go on

Dobie and Gertrude hurry toward the house Parcher icing
smeared on his moustache squints into the distance

EXT DAKOTA BADLANDS-— DAY

We reveal the rider Dutch He drives his horse through the
knee-high grass towards Parcher a half-mile distant

EXT THE SPACKS HOUSE- DAY

Dutch rears his frothing horse to a halt in the shade of the
box elder and dismounts a few feet from parcher Dobie and
Gertrude are specks in the grass halfway back to the House

PARCHER
Dutch god damnit I was having a
picnic

DUTCH (BREATHLESS)
Indians They killed Here

Dutch fishes a many-folded square of paper from his pocket
and hands it to Parcher Scrawled in grease pencil-

INDIAN MASSACRE AT WASHBURNER CRICK WILLIAMS FAMILY DEAD
STEWART FAMILY KIDNAPPED 6 MISSING FETCHING HENRY V

- CLAY
DUTCH

Maryanne her whole family

PARCHER

DUTCH
Yes no Mr Williams did And
then what is the word

Dutch pantomimes shooting himself in the mouth

PARCHER
Suicide

Dutch points at Parcher exactly
INT GERTRUDES PARLOR- DAY

Dutch thirstily drains a glass of water jams his derby back
onto his head The parlor is sparse Victorian dusty

PARCHER
1f were dealing with Crow or
Ute Dobie could see things a boy
shouldnt have to

Parcher perches on a stool pulling on his boots Gertrude
watches Dobie tie provision onto two horses outside

GERTRUDE
Ive made up my mind Will

PARCHER
Youve already lost a man to the
Indians I dont want to take
another

GERTRUDE
I dont have a man in this house
Ive got a boy You take him to
Washburne Crick and bring him back
and maybe Ill have two

Parchers pleased with this Gertrude turns to Dutch

GERTRUDE
Would you like more water

Dutch shakes his head

DUTCH
We have to go

Dobie enters from the front porch dressed in brand-new
riding clothes Hes Christmas-morning excited

DOBIE
The horses are ready

PARCHER
Then lets get to it

Gertrude takes Dobies head kisses his forehead

GERTRUDE
Be good Mr Parcher’s lived
through everything this country
could throw at him You stay close
and mind him and you’1l be fine
(then to Parcher-)
And you too

She kisses him lightly on the cheek Parcher mugs pleased
shock before leaning to kiss her back She shoves him off

GERTRUDE
When you get back

PARCHER
Yes maam

Parcher and Dobie eye each other significantly both happy
and uncomfortable Dutch puts down his empty water glass

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK- DAY

Dutch stands in the open doorway of the empty Stewart house
looking in The Williams house is open behind him no sign
of Parcher or Dobie Dutch walks around the house and
notices a SHADOW on the edge of the settlement past the
barn a dark circle in the grass He walks over to it

A CIRCULAR DEPRESSION about four feet across the grass
pushed aside and collapsed the earth beneath it churned
Hundreds of ANTS crawl around in the soil

Dutch crouches and presses his fingers into the circle They
sink easily into the dirt

INT THE WILLIAMS HOUSE- DAY

In the dimmed light Parcher and Dobie cover their mouths
with dust cloths Out of focus DEEP CRIMSON stains the walls
and ceiling behind them Parcher crouches over MRS WILLIAMS
DEAD BODY-

A matronly corpse shotgunned The neck and chest are roughly
buckshot-torn her arm nearly separated Theres very little
blood just the raspberry chew of the wound

PARCHER
She should have bled out more
Same with the girls

DOBIE
Ida and Daphne I think those
where their names

Dobie cant help but glance through the doorway into the
girls bedroom where lie-

The TWO DEAD WILLIAMS GIRLS Small nightshirt-clad bodies

twisted in sheets torn and singed by buckshot Remarkably

little blood Child flesh chewed like ground chuck Dobie
is close to retching These are far from the first corpses
Parcher’s seen Any concern he shows is for Dobie almost

like a kind uncle

PARCHER

You want to wait outside
DOBIE

No
PARCHER

Good I wonder

Parcher looks at a GASH in Mrs Williams neck a good eight
inches above any shotgun damage Its about an inch across
and six inches long It sinks over half an inch into her
neck but doesnt appear to have bled

PARCHER
What kind of weapon makes a wound
like that A chisel Some kind of
wood plane

As he talks Dobie turns and looks at the source of all that
crimson behind them

MR WILLIAMS HEADLESS CORPSE on the rough floorboards by the
fireplace the shotgun he used to decapitate himself lying
between his curled hands

And BLOOD Unlike his wife and girls there was no shortage
of the stuff inside Dad It marks the wall and ceiling
behind him Jackson-Pollock style

Dobie stares at the twin barrel of the bloody shotgun

DOBIE
That gun only fires twice
(Parcher waits for him)
--He would have had to reload To
kill everybody

PARCHER
If it was Appaches or Crow any
Christian woman would prefer dying
to capture If Mr Williams had
time to reload its because his
wife gave it to him

Dobie looks at the ground

PARCHER
If it came to that I hope youd be
strong enough to take care of your
mother

Dobie stares into the bedroom at the little girls’ corpses

DOBIE
Alright

PARCHER
Our pity belongs to the Stewart
family theyre still alive and
captive

DUTCH (0S INTERRUPTING)
Mr Parcher Mr Clays coming

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK YARD- DAY
Dutch stares to the horizon TWO DOZEN RIDERS approach

Parcher and Dobie emerge from the Williams house Parcher
uncorks some whisky and squints at the approaching riders

PARCHER
He find Henry Victor

DUTCH
Yeah and near thirty bluecoats

PARCHER
Mighty Christ That cock-sure
little shit’s brought the whole
fort

Dutch sees Dobie his eyes red-rimmed and glassy Dutch
touches the boys shoulder

DUTCH
You alright

PARCHER
Get off the boy hes fine

Dutch withdraws his hand Parcher drinks some whisky

DUTCH
I found something

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK BEHIND THE BARN- DAY

Parcher crouching before the circle sinks his hand into the
softened earth up to his wrist Dutch and Dobie hover behind
him The two dozen RIDERS approach in the distance

PARCHER
I spose a wallowing buffalo
coulda done this

He smells the dirt on his finger

Clay at the head of the dozen riders reigns his horse to a
stop a few yards behind Parcher

HENRY VICTOR stops his own horse beside him He’s 40 years
old a thin tall dandy with a doughboy face and sharp
arrogant eyes the spoiled child of a Texan war hero He
wears military blue and Lieutenants stripes

HENRY VICTOR
Looks like you found yourself a
hole in the ground Will

There’s an old rivalry between them Parcher stands to face
the mounted men as a half dozen of HVs BLUECOATS arrive
behind them Parcher grins at the insult brushing the ants
from his hand

PARCHER
That and four corpses And six
missing Most of those being women
and children

DUTCH
Ill get the horses

Dutch starts back towards the yard HV stops him

HENRY VICTOR
Hold up now This is my command I
gotta know who we’re hunting How
long have the Indians had them

Clay looks annoyed at HV’s obvious arrogant pleasure at
exercising authority

The Bluecoats behind him are soldiers between the ages of 15
and 30 Other Bluecoats ride into the settlement below

PARCHER
Near a day now

HENRY VICTOR
Thats more than long enough for
those women to’ve been

Dobie looks at Parcher long enough for what Dutch looks
sick with HV’s implication

DUTCH
We should go The longer we wait-

HENRY VICTOR
You want to go face an Indian war
party on your lonesome

Dutch clenches his fists looks to Clay for support Clay
shakes his head no

HENRY VICTOR
You go off alone those blanket
heads will peel you like an orange

PARCHER
Maryanne is lukewarm on you with
your skin on Dutch Follow along
well do this thing right

HENRY VICTOR (TO PARCHER)
You think its the Sioux

PARCHER
Id incline to guess Apache or
Commanche Got a family suicide
leads me believe the tribed have a
right smart reputation for torture

HENRY VICTOR
The Sioux understand torture

His intonation almost sounds like a cruel inappropriate
joke At any rate a few of the Bluecoats SNICKER

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK YARD- DAY

Dutch Parcher and Clay stride quickly across the yard
leading HV towards the Williams house

Dutch eyes the approaching open door warily a little sick
Its so quiet that we can just hear the FLIES inside

They pass a young black man leaning against the Williams
house porch railing WALNUT CALLAGHAN (late 20s)
Callaghan wears a worn bluecoat jacket but the rest of his
clothes are catch-as-catch-can

Dutch slows hes not happy to be walking back into a
slaughterhouse

Parcher Clay and HV pass the BLUECOAT LIEUTENANT standing
watch at the door and enter the Williams house Dutch
lingers on the porch HV looks back at him

HENRY VICTOR
Your Occidental isnt coming in

Dutch shakes his head close to puking HV smirks and lets
the door shut

Dutch walks back out into the dirt patch and puts his hands
on his knees The nausea passes and he spits looks out at
the horizon Callaghan sits nearby

CALLAGHAN
You alright man

DUTCH (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
We should be going after them

CALLAGHAN
Did you know these people

DUTCH
I do I know the Stewarts

Dutch removes the rolled-up photo of the Stewarts from his
vest and hands it to Callaghan He points at Maryanne

DUTCH
That’s Maryanne

CALLAGHAN
She yours

Dutch shakes his head no

DUTCH
I was working on it

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK LANDSCAPE- DAY

We see the small cluster of homes overrun with Bluecoats
surrounded by an ocean of grass We MOVE THROUGH the grass
as if following something stalking the settlement

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK THE WILLIAMS HOUSE- DAY

Dobie has joined Dutch and Callaghan by the porch Dutch
finishes rolling a cigarette and hands it to the boy

HV SLAMS the door of the Williams House open startling
Dutch to his feet Fuming HV stalks across the porch
says to the nearest Bluecoat-

HENRY VICTOR
Send a scout to Fort Lincoln Tell
them to wagon up the gatlin and
meet us at the reservation

DUTCH
Are we going

CLAY (0S)
Not yet

Clay and Parcher emerge from the house

CLAY
Not till we put the Williams below
ground I christened those little
girls and I intend to give them a
Christian burial

DOBIE
But the Stewarts are

PARCHER
We go off on horses that ain’t been
rested we won’t make it ten miles
We got time for a burial

Dutch clenches his fists knows Parcher’s right Dobie’s
edging towards his horse and Dutch stops him

DUTCH
Let’s get the grain

Dutch turns to attend to the horses As Dobie starts to
follow Parcher takes the cigarette from him and smokes it

PARCHER
No reason to route the heathen if
were going to act like him

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK GRAVES- DAY

Two dozen BLUECOATS Parcher Dutch Dobie Callaghan and
HV before four open graves Clay at the head-

CLAY
God tests us and when he takes the
innocent shows us weve failed
Jesus on the mount said that the
meek would inherit the earth and
there they are down in it I
believe that was as much a
commandment as a beatitude

Throughout the sermon Dutch seems distracted anxious to get
on the trail He looks out at the plains

CLAY
On that same mount Jesus said
blessed are the peacemakers for
they shall be called the children
of God We need to be those
children We got to work to make
the earth a fit place for the meek
May God give the Williams family
peace and paradise where we could
not And give us the wisdom and
perseverance to carry on until
weve finished His work Amen

ALL
Amen

Clay looks at the crowd for a moment Dutch puts on his hat
ready to leave The Bluecoats move to disperse

Clay launches into a hymn Alas and Did My Savior Bleed-
Dutch takes his hat back off the Bluecoats get back in line

CLAY (SINGING)
Alas and did my savior bleed
And did my sovereign die
Would he devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I

The others join in HV sings reverently Dobie sings with
his eyes closed Bluecoats do the best they can

Dutch HUMS along He notices an INDIAN standing among HVs
bluecoats This is TEN BEAR Crow Tribe dressed in a
scouts mixture of Indian and Bluecoat garb He sings along
perfectly Dutch gawks

Ten Bear feels Dutchs eyes and meets his gaze
EXT PLAINS- AFTERNOON

Hundreds of hooves THUNDER over the plains We still hear
the HYMN being sung Riders are scattered over an acre

Clay Parcher and Dobie ride grouped together The Bluecoats
ride in rough formation Dutch is driving the mess wagon
HV rides at the head with Ten Bear

GROUP (SINGING)
Thy body slain sweet Jesus thine
And bathed in its own blood
While the firm mark of wraith divine
His soul in anguish stood

As the post-lapped HYMN ends-

CLAY
Damnation We aint going to find
kidnapped whites on a reservation

PARCHER
I know it

CLAY
I aint set to waste my time while
theyre scalping the men and raping
our women

PARCHER
Were about a days ride shy of the
Hunkpapa trail to Canada Swhere
Id be headed if I was a band of
fugitive Indians

Clay nods thinking Dobie listens attentively

CLAY
We could set off alone

PARCHER
Im chewing the same cud but
thered only be four of us

CLAY
We have to find the Stewarts If we
can do that with Henry Victors
help fine If not fine

PARCHER
--I guess you’ve had every chance
to and aint killed us yet Though
what wed do if-

Jump scare- Parcher suddenly LURCHES forward his horse
SCREAMS and stumbles nearly throwing him Clay’s reigns in
his own horse and grabs the lead of Parcher’s steadying the
animal as Parcher jumps clear

DOBIE
Mr Parcher What

Parcher gathers his wits
PARCHER
Salright Dobie Must of stepped
in a prairie dog hole

Parcher puts a calming hand on his horse’s muzzle

PARCHER (TO THE HORSE)
There you go S’alright

CLAY
How’s that leg

Parcher crouches and examines the fetlock

PARCHER
A little blood but she’s standing

(to Dobie)

Hey Cowboy hump on ahead see how

Parcher stands as Dobie spurs his horse forward Once hes
out of earshot-

CLAY

Crocket

PARCHER

Parcher climbs up onto his horse

CLAY

Parcher looks at him A beat

CLAY (BONE DRY)

A beat The first joke Clay’s made in months Parcher laughs
Clay lets himself smile they spur their horses forward

We TILT DOWN to what neither man saw the “prairie dog hole”
that Parcher’s horse stepped in Beneath the grass the hole
is blood-colored filled with dim GORE and shards of broken
RIB-BONES

ACROSS THE GROUP

Dutch driving the mess wagon nods to Callaghan as he
passes The young black man veers his horse closer

DUTCH
Who is Henry Victors Indian

Callaghan looks towards the head of the group where Ten Bear
gestures and talks low to HV

CALLAGHAN

Dutch reaches out his hand Callaghan shakes it laughing

DUTCH

CALLAGHAN
Good to meet you

AT THE FRONT OF THE GROUP

Dobie rides past Bluecoats and forward to where HV takes a
pair of binoculars from Ten Bear

HV points out something straight ahead to two BLUECOAT
LIEUTENANTS The Lieutenants nod and head back to their
squads Ten Bear hands HV a rifle HV sees Dobie-

HENRY VICTOR
Take a look yonder

Dobie squints into the distance A SHAPE in the grass

DOBIE
Is that a horse

He hands Dobie the binoculars Dobie peers through-

DOBIES TELEPHOTO POV- A MINECONJOU INDIAN dismounted from
his HORSE walking in small irregular circles and staring at
the ground

The Mineconjou glances up looking almost directly at Dobie
then continues his search of the ground

DOBIE
Hes seen us

HENRY VICTOR
You think I don’t know that

DOBIE
Then why aint he run

ACROSS THE PLAINS- TWO COLUMNS of BLUECOATS six men each
break free of the group and CHARGE galloping across the
plains towards the lone Indian

DOBIES TELEPHOTO POV- The Indian sees the charging soldiers
He runs for his horse a spotted mustang

The Mineconjou prepares to jump on his horse as-
HV raises the rifle to his shoulder takes aim CRACK

DOBIES POV- the horse jerks with the rifles impact and
twists sideways falling to the ground

ACROSS THE PLAINS- The Indian jumps away from the falling
beast as it kicks and pumps blood The two columns of riders
race towards him flanking him North and South closing in
like pincers

The Indian turns and sprints West tearing on foot through
the tall grass The two columns of mounted soldiers close
in hooves THUNDER

The SOUTHERN COLUMN sweeps in first scooping around the
Indian He stops running and draws a knife

He turns away from the Southern Column just in time for the
lead horse of the NORTHERN COLUMN to arrive the mounted
Bluecoat swinging his rifle like a club-

CHUNK The Indian catches the rifle flat across the side of
his head His feet leave earth he pinwheels through the
air head trailing blood and SLAMS into the ground

EXT PLAINS CAMP- LATE AFTERNOON

Clay crouches over the horse HV shot Nearby two
BLUECOATS bind the Indians hands to a wagon wheel Blood
leaks from the Indians brow Ten Bear crouches in front of
him MURMURING at the captive

Parcher looks at the Indian Dobie and Dutch stand nearby
staring HV stands in the center well-satisfied

CLAY
You didnt have to shoot his horse

HENRY VICTOR
Christ you gonna make us bury
that too

Clay stands and HV crosses to Ten Bear

HENRY VICTOR
What does he say

TEN BEAR
Nothing

HENRY VICTOR
Ask what he was looking for in the
grass

Ten Bear leans in close and MURMURS words to the Indian
making signs with his hands No response

Dutch pulls the photo of the Stewarts from his vest and hands
it to Clay Clay nods and crouches next to Ten Bear showing
the photo to the captive To Parcher-

CLAY
Ask him

Parcher speaks in sub-titled Sioux making signs with his
hands as he speaks

PARCHER (SIOUX ST)
We need to find these white
people Bad Indians took You help

No response Clay stands annoyed

CLAY
We dont have time for this Lets

PARCHER

Bull Bear

The Indian looks up sharply

PARCHER
But you no Bull Bear Bull Bear

Parcher nods offers a friendly grin

PARCHER
You Dull Knife Son of Bull Bear

The Indian DULL KNIFE stares at Parcher a few moments and
then drops his gaze Parcher stands-

PARCHER
His names Dull Knife

CLAY
Carrying a prisoners gonna slow us

HENRY VICTOR
Id rather walk in the right
direction than run with my head up
my ass Were running short of
daylight well camp here

CLAY
Were wasting time we aint got
Henry You know whats happening
to those Stewart girls right now

Dutch looks sick Clay presses the Stewart photo into HVs
hands HV is suddenly very conscious of the Bluecoats
nearby watching

HENRY VICTOR
This isnt your outfit Clay If we
need to raise any pigs we’ll ask
your advice But renegade Indians
are my job

CLAY
If men like me and Will Parcher
hadnt cleared this land of
Indians men like you would be dead
on a spit and you know it

HENRY VICTOR
These soldiers are under my
authority Mine So long as you
ride with us you are too

He tries to hand the family photo back to Clay who lets it
drop in the grass Dutch appeals to Clay-

DUTCH
We’re not gonna stop

CLAY
That Indian doesnt know shit and
wouldnt talk if he did

HENRY VICTOR (SMILING)
Hell talk

Dutch picks the Stewart family photo out of the grass and
puts it back in his vest

EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Off-screen Dull Knife SCREAMS Its dinner time None of
the Bluecoats look up from their plates or away from their
conversations theyve grown used to the sound

Scattered CAMPFIRES Men eat sociably drink coffee

WE MOVE TO-

Parcher Clay HV and Dobie sitting in a group near the
campfire finishing dinner 0S Dull Knife SCREAMS Only
Dobie looks over

WE MOVE TO-

Dutch moving through the Bluecoats trying to see whats
happening to Dull Knife

Ten Bear is crouching in front of the bound Minneconjou on
the edge of the firelight doing something to the soles of
Dull Knifes feet Dutch moves tangent to the two Indians
circling around trying to see what Ten Bear is doing Dull
Knife SCREAMS The cry echoes across the plains no reaction
from the Bluecoats

Ten Bear pulls a SMALL NOB away from Dull Knifes foot and
sets it on the ground something pale with a dark shiny
gloss It could be metal or it could be bone

CALLAGHAN (OS)
You dont want to see that

Callaghan touches Dutchs shoulder and he jumps

DUTCH
Walnut Sorry Callaghan I
mean Has he talked
CALLAGHAN

Nah Aint even the point Ten Bear
stopped asking questions a half
hour back Come get some coffee

They walk towards the mess wagon Callaghan pats his leg

CALLAGHAN
I was born with this leg gimp
flesh all withered and shrunk Mr
Callaghan the man that owned my
mother named me Walnut because he
thought I looked like one I aint
partial to the name

They arrive at the wagon Callaghan pours coffee Dull
Knifes SCREAMS dies down to pained BREATHING

DUTCH
I cant see anything wrong with
your leg

CALLAGHAN

Its weak Hurts most of the time

DUTCH
»I dont like Henry Victor

CALLAGHAN
The mans a sack of horse-shit

Dutch grins in agreement Then-

DUTCH
Im Belgian But they thought I
was German on Ellis Island so they
put my name down as Dutch

CALLAGHAN
What the hell kind of sense does
that make

Dutch shakes his head

CALLAGHAN
You come to this country alone

DUTCH (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
I had a sister the boat killed her
and we put her in the water All I
kept of hers was a I don’t know
the English a “broche”

Dutch gestures at his chest shaping a brooch

DUTCH
---I gave it to Maryanne Stewart

He looks at the ground A beat

DUTCH
I barely knew her but I thought
she might

Dutch swallows takes a breath Callaghan fills space-

CALLAGHAN
Tell me your real name again

DUTCH
Van Martjin Leijderova

CALLAGHAN
Shit You want more coffee Dutch

DUTCH
Yeah

Dutch glances over towards Dull Knife He sits alone bound
to the wagon wheel feet covered in bloody rags

CALLAGHAN
He’s give up for the night praise
God
(considers then-)
Shit I hope this gets me fired

Callaghan grabs the bowl of scraps and carries it over to
Dull Knife He sets it on the ground next to him

CALLAGHAN
Go on you can eat Its alright

Dull Knife looks at the bowl of food he wants it badly He
looks at Callaghan His eyes narrow somewhere between
menace and pity

DULL KNIFE (SIOUX SUBTTLED)
You’1ll be awake in your grave
Youll be alive when they feed

Callaghan furrows his brow doesn’t understand He nudges
the bowl of food again

CALLAGHAN
Go on eat

No reaction from Dull Knife Callaghan SIGHS and walks back
towards the Wagon where Dutch drinks coffee

HENRY VICTOR (0S)
Walnut My tobaccos dry

DUTCH
I got it

Dutch grabs a sack of tobacco and walks towards the fire

BY THE FIRE

Parcher Dobie Clay HV and a half-dozen BLUECOATS sit
Theyre drinking whiskey coffee theyre rolling cigarettes

Dutch approaches HV sees him

HENRY VICTOR
Wheres Walnut

DUTCH
I brought tobacco

HENRY VICTOR
Much obliged

HV takes the sack with one hand while he fishes in his vest
with the other pulling out a small TOBACCO POUCH that he
tosses to Parcher It looks like shriveled leather

PARCHER
What the hell is this

HENRY VICTOR
Tobacco pouch

PARCHER
Its ugly as shit

HENRY VICTOR
Came off an Injun Big buck named
Sackatabacky

A few Bluecoats LAUGH

CLAY
Oh Jesus Christ

Parcher throws the shriveled tobacco pouch back to HV who
fills it as he tells a story excessively proud-

HENRY VICTOR
My daddy was one of the men behind
the rifles that held off the Sioux
at the battle for New Ulm

HV meaningfully shakes the pouch

HENRY VICTOR
Henry Victor senior cut this off
one of them Indians Lends the
tobacco a sweetness Ive grown
right partial to

DOBIE
What is it

PARCHER
Its a scrotum Dobie

Dobie reacts HV turns his attention to the boy

HENRY VICTOR
You know the story of New Ulm boy

DOBIE
Yessir My father died there

HENRY VICTOR
Well alright then Did you know it
was more American civilians than
ever died in anything else Not a
soldier among ‘em Six hundred
dead by the lowest count

(MORE)

HENRY VICTOR (contd)
The Sioux knew they couldnt face
the army so they attacked a town
of unarmed farmers women
children

HV is condescending tells the story like Sunday School
He licks seals and lights a scrotal-tobacco cigarette

DOBIE
Yessir I heard that

HENRY VICTOR
I hope you know your daddy died
noble Ill raise a drink to him
and every man at this fire Well
make sure we never see anything
like that in this country again

CLAY
Ill drink to it

PARCHER
Any reasons a good one

They raise flasks and enamel mugs and drink

They fall respectfully quiet The sudden silence reveals a
SLURPING and CHEWING They all look over to-

Dull Knife hungrily shoveling scraps from the bowl and into
his mouth HV exhales smoke

HENRY VICTOR
Who fed my Indian

He stands strides across the camp and kicks the bowl out of
Dull Knifes hands Scraps fly

HENRY VICTOR
We dont find those settlers ‘til
he talks so he dont eat ‘til he
talks WHO FED MY GODDAMNED INDIAN

HV kicks Dull Knife in the Stomach doubling him over
Chewed food flies from his mouth HV picks up a loose
stirrup a metal buckle on two feet of leather strap an
impromptu LASH Everybody watches him Parcher and Clay get
to their feet

HENRY VICTOR
Walnut Where are you

Walnut is absent HV is rabid Several tense moments then-
DUTCH
--Ll fed him

Everybody turns to look at Dutch HV
with the stirrup lash He raises his

HENRY VICTOR

You ignorant son of a bitch

CLAY
Henry

stalks towards Dutch

arm

HV looks over Clay has a hand on his gun HV

considers then

HENRY VICTOR

-You raise that gun and all four
of youll be on ropes in an hour

Clay stands holding his gun HV stands holding his lash
Dutch looks like hes about to piss Parcher gets up

PARCHER

Christ Henry he was just gonna
shoot you a little bit And if
Dutch fed him the same shit your
cook fed us he aint no happiern

he was ‘fore he et Leave it rest

HENRY VICTOR

This is my command Mine I cant

have my authority undermined

PARCHER(TO DUTCH)
Apologize to the man for
undermining him

DUTCH
I am sorry

With his accent its hard to suss his sincerity

and shakes his head To a Lieutenant-

HENRY VICTOR

Bugle taps were bedding down I

want a three man watch until dawn
I want guns on the night Anybody
tries to sneak back into camp
anything moves kill it

HV spits

TIME LAPSE- EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

The Bluecoats and cowboys wrapped in their blankets asleep
in small groups Soft SNORES the RUSTLING grass

A soft RATTLE rolls across the plains like the largo
creaking of an ungreased door Almost a PURR Dutch lies
awake in his blankets staring at the sky

A BLUECOAT SENTRY slouched by the fire struggles to keep his
eyes open leaning on his rifle The RATTLING PURR laps
against him each swell tugging him towards sleep The soft
PURR rises again the Sentrys eyes close

A BLUECOAT LIEUTENANT sleeps on his side on the edge of camp
spooning with his rifle

Dutch looks over the camp Everybody else is asleep

Except Dull Knife He sits awake eyes sunken desperate
He stares at the plains watching the slowly waving grass

Dutch lies back down watching Dull Knife Dull Knifes eyes
shine in the campfire Dutch closes his eyes

The Bluecoat Lieutenant sleeping soundly on his side We
move to a short distance away where a small circle of earth
beneath the grass slowly starts to TREMBLE The circle
spreads blades of grass fall

Five man-shaped FIGURES crawl towards him out of the grass
They slink on all fours silent In the starlight and dying
campfire embers we can just barely see their burnt-looking
mottled flesh Their movement is predatory inhuman

The Bluecoat Lieutenant doesnt wake up when a TALON an
organic-looking blade touches the hollow between his collar
bone and throat

RIIIP- the talon is dragged across the Lieutenants neck
carving a deep trench in the flesh The wound is deep but
does not bleed the scarlet blood instantly coagulating

The Lieutenants eyes open and immediately hands on his body
CLAMP DOWN hard holding him immobile

The Lieutenants eyes roll wildly A RETCHING SOUND off
screen a SPLATTER and then the Lieutenants face goes
slack His eyes still conscious stare ahead

He is completely immobile A beat A RATTLING A PURR
The Lieutenant is abruptly YANKED off-screen

FROM A DISTANCE-

Out in the plains down in the grass the dwindling campfires
offer a rich glow against the waving moonlit grass SHAPES
are being dragged out into the plains the grass forming Vs
behind them like a wake in water

CUT TO BLACK

HENRY VICTOR (0S)
Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit

EXT PLAINS CAMP- MORNING

Dutch opens his eyes Most of the Bluecoats are already up
Parcher is drinking coffee getting his boots on Dutch sits
up HV storms around the camp like a child in a tantrum

HENRY VICTOR
Somebody saw those yellow shit-
heels desert I will not god-
damned believe four men left camp
and nobody even god-damned stirred

Bluecoats hurry into boots and uniforms Dutch sees Clay
standing nearby looking out at the grass

DUTCH(TO PARCHER)

PARCHER

DUTCH

PARCHER
Thats the question
CLAY
Somebody dragged em off
DUTCH
The Indian didnt sleep Dull

TIME LAPSE- ACROSS CAMP- MORNING
Dull Knife stares at the ground beaten and exhausted

Parcher and Ten Bear crouch in front of him Clay watches
from nearby whisky bottle in hand HV paces

PARCHER
Shit You sure you didnt find him
out front of a tobacco shop

HV snorts Dutch approaches tucking in his shirt

YOUNG BLUECOAT(OS)
Sir Mr Victor

Henry Victor looks over a YOUNG BLUECOAT is crouching over
one of the missing mens blankets

YOUNG BLUECOAT
Theres blood here I think Not a
lot but

HV stalks over Clay on his heels There is a six-inch
smear of blood on the soldiers gray blankets

HENRY VICTOR
Ive bled more from a pulled tooth

He turns and stalks back over to Dull Knife Clay crouches
and examines the blood Parcher crouching speaks
conversationally with Dull Knife

PARCHER(SIOUX SUB-TITLED)
Know you talk Seen you talk
young boy

No response from Dull Knife

Henry Victor is livid his face nearly twitching staring at
Dull Knife Dull Knife stares back

HV steps on one of Dull Knifes bloody feet Dull Knife
SCREAMS through clenched teeth Dutch turns away sick
HV takes the weight off his foot Dull Knife PANTS

HENRY VICTOR
Whats he got to say now

PARCHER
We already know that dont work

Parcher stands and turns away Dull Knife catches his breath
then the corner of his mouth twitches he whispers-

DULL KNIFE(SIOUX SUB-TITLED)
Im glad they like white men
too

HENRY VICTOR
What was that

TEN BEAR
He says he likes white men

DULL KNIFE
The Burrowers

Parcher listens intently

TEN BEAR
He says about another tribe
Miners

HENRY VICTOR
Miners Indian miners

PARCHER
He didnt say miners Men mine
He used the word for when animals
dig Burrow maybe
(To Dull Knife)
The tribe Burrowers Last night

HENRY VICTOR
Let my buck do his job Will

Ten Bear leans in close to Dull Knife cutting off Parcher

TEN BEAR
Where do we find the Burrowers

Dull Knife nearly manages a smile despite the pain

DULL KNIFE
They1ll find you

He leans in whispers just for Ten Bear-

DULL KNIFE
Even if you do taste like white
man by now

They lock eyes Ten Bear grabs Dull Knifes bloody mess of a
foot SQUEEZES Dull Knife SCREAMS

Clay steps over and SHOVES Ten Bear off with his boot
knocking him to the ground

CLAY
Ive finished listening to that
Indian scream

HENRY VICTOR
Hes shit-all for information
anyway Well get our answers from
the reservation

PARCHER
This aint the Sioux Henry He
just said the Burrowers

HENRY VICTOR
I dont have time to be second
guessed Theres four white women

HV swallows his last words grimacing

PARCHER
All the more reason we shouldnt be
looking in the one place we know
they aint

HENRY VICTOR
We have to fight the enemy thats
before us Were going to the rez

Parchers about to respond when

DOBIE(OS)
Mr Parcher

They look over Dobie is waving from the grass near the edge
of camp Clay and Parcher head over HV moves in the
opposite direction towards his lieutenants

AT THE EDGE OF CAMP-

Parcher crouches over a CIRCULAR INDENTATION of crushed grass
next to Dobie just like at Washburne Crick Clay continues
past the circle out towards the prairie

PARCHER(TO DOBIE)
What do you think Cowboy

DOBIE
I dunno sir

CLAY ( YELLING )
Theres another one A third
yonder

He points further North Behind them HVs Bluecoats are
already packing up and heading West Parcher nods to Clay
showing that he heard the man

PARCHER(TO DOBIE)
Shitfire Henry Victord rather
pull fingers off the Sioux than
follow the trail before us

DOBIE
Sorry sir

PARCHER
-I think were about set to quit
our military escort

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS- LATE MORNING

POUNDING HOOVES Dutch Clay Parcher and Dobie gallop out
through the grass moving quickly now that theyre alone

Dutch looks back at the train of Bluecoats quickly vanishing
in the distance

Clay riding ahead slows his horse to examine another
SHALLOW PIT in a ring of crushed grass

TIME LAPSE- SOUTHERN PLAINS- AFTERNOON

Small gnarled trees dot the landscape The four riders cast
long shadows climbing a gentle slope From a distance we
show how tiny they are how isolated

EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey The four sit
around a campfire the last scraps of dinner in the enamel
pot on the fires edge Theyre unrolling blankets getting
ready for bed passing the bottle

Dutch shows Dobie how to roll a cigarette

Clay takes an immensely satisfied drink and passes the
bottle Parcher takes it and grins

PARCHER
Great god a-mighty Im tired
Aint been rode this hard since we
gulched the Darrows

Clay nods and hands him back the bottle Parcher passes the
bottle to Dutch then nudges Dobie

PARCHER
On the trail of hostile Indians
What do you think cowboy

DOBIE (SMILING)
Its alright

Dutch takes a swig and passes then gets to his feet wearily
stretching

DUTCH
Excuse me

Scratching his back he walks away from the fire-

EXT PLAINS- NIGHT

Only a stones throw from camp Dutch is already out of the
feeble flickering throw of firelight We can see how the

darkness and endless space makes him nervous

The knee-deep grass is pitch-black in the moonlight Dutch
pulls out his pecker and pisses into the grass

BACK AT CAMP
Dobie takes a swig of liquor pretending like he enjoys it

PARCHER
You been doing real good Dobie

DOBIE
Thank you sir

PARCHER

You oughta sleep Well be up and

moving long before dawn Only got

a few days to find them Stewarts

before we wouldnt want to
Dobie starts to ask him what he means then holds his tongue
EXT PLAINS- NIGHT
Dutch pisses into the grass looking out at the few gnarled
dwarfish trees shaking in the wind His eyes are a little
glassy with liquor He YAWNS
From a distance- Dutch starts to button up his pants We can
see him clearly silhouetted against the flickering light of
camp an easy target
A SHAPE passes in front of the camera

EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Clay takes a pensive drink sitting on his blankets

CLAY
You think those men last night
deserted

PARCHER
You mean ruthern got drug off

Clay nods Beat Parcher shakes his head
PARCHER
F’they did I hope they died fast
You ever heard of an Indian tribe
called the Burrowers

Clay shakes his head no and pulls a BIBLE from his vest

CLAY
Well stand watch two hour shifts

EXT PLAINS- NIGHT

Dutch turns and starts walking back towards camp He doesnt
hear a SNAP a dozen yards away

He continues towards camp leaving frame We linger on the
dark landscape behind him-

Against the waving grass between the small gnarled trees
its impossible to see clearly But we can just make out-

TWO SHAPES moving towards the fire

EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dobie curls into his blankets and closes his eyes Parcher
already looks asleep Only Clay sits upright holding
Parchers rifle reading his bible by fire-light

Dutch walks into the edge of the firelight He doesnt see
the DARK SHAPE looming behind him

Clay looks up at Dutch then past him A momentary look of
concern crosses his face He puts his Bible in his vest

The grass sways in the wind behind Dutch Clay jerks the
rifle up and levels it almost directly at Dutch

Dutch freezes

DUTCH
What

CALLAGHAN (OFF-SCREEN)
Dont shoot

Dutch jumps like something bit him

Parcher comes out of his blankets cocking his revolver as he
sits up Dobie scrambles to his feet

CALLAGHAN
Its me its Callaghan Mr Henry-
Victors cook

Leading his horse Callaghan emerges from the darkness behind
Dutch and into the firelight

PARCHER
Shitfire Walnut You alone

CALLAGHAN
Yeah

Parcher drops his pistol

CLAY
You trying to get shot

Callaghan moves in towards the fire realizing how close to
getting shot he was

PARCHER
Great Christ Tie up your horse
and set You missed dinner

Callaghan nods thanks to Parcher then nods hello to Dutch
Dutch nods back

TIME LAPSE- EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Callaghan sits with the others their conversation already in
progress

CALLAGHAN
I cant rightly account for the
others Didnt even know they was
missing until now

CLAY
Deserting the armys a felony
They could hang you for that and
jail us for riding with you

CALLAGHAN
I didnt desert Werent enlisted

Clay looks at Parcher who raises his eyebrows in question
Clay nods

PARCHER
Well if youre riding with us
youre working for us

CALLAGHAN
Thats fine

CLAY
Its nasty work in unfriendly
country You want to make it back
to the ranch youll follow and do
as your told

Callaghan nods Pauses then-

CALLAGHAN
Can I ask which one of yall is

CLAY

DUTCH
Listen to Parcher do what Clay
says

PARCHER
Ill be dog the Germans been
paying attention Welcome to the

Parcher reaches out and shakes Callaghans hand
EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS- PRE-DAWN

In the lead-gray light the five riders course across the
grasslands

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DAY

One of the round SHALLOW PITS of crushed grass and churned
earth The five riders pass in the distance

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Coffees on the campfire Callaghan dishes out food The
grass moves in the wind around them

EXT PLAINS HUNKPAPA TRAIL- LATE AFTERNOON

Dutch Dobie and Callaghan ride in a loose group through the
grass Dobie pulls the mess wagon

Parcher and Clay have ridden ahead and sit talking The
three ride close enough to hear their conversation-

PARCHER
-seen the last of them pits a
half day back

The trail before them is little more than a slight depression
in the earth stretching roughly East and West

PARCHER
Id say we follow the trail but
its your call

CLAY
--Take your rest I need to
ruminate

Parcher SIGHS They all dismount except Clay who rides a
few paces forward

Dutch walks over to Parcher who takes a swig of whiskey

DUTCH
Which way are we going

PARCHER
You’1l go whatever direction we
tell you to I guess

Parcher offers Dutch the whiskey Dutch drinks then gives
the bottle back

He walks back towards Dobie and Callaghan grabs a small
stone from the ground and chucks it at a gnarled dead tree
eighty feet distant The stone makes a pleasant TOK sound
against the trunk

Dobie grins at Dutch impressed The boy grabs a rock off
the ground aims and throws it at the tree It sails past
well wide Dobie leans down searches among the grass roots
and picks up another stone He chucks it at the tree and
again misses

Callaghan sees the game and joins in picking up stones and
throwing them at the tree He misses twice

Dutch watches the two try to repeat his throw smiling as
they keep missing It’s a moment of near-relaxation the
three suddenly boys again

Dobie steps forward into the grass and stoops down
searching the dark earth for another stone

Dutch pulls a piece of grass from its sheath and chews on the
tender base

FROM A DISTANCE- we see the five men alone in an ocean of
grass vulnerable

Dobie can’t find another stone He pushes some grass aside
and pauses There’s an 8-inch lock of BLONDE HAIR pressed
into the dark earth

Dobie’s hand hovers over the strands for a moment before
lifting it from the ground It’s human hair He gives it a
gentle tug

SCHRT the lock of hair RIPS free from the earth a blood-red
postage stamp of wet SCALP dangling from the end

Dobie’s jaw drops He GASPS and flings the hair away

Callaghan steps over looks down There’s a patch of OPEN
WOUND in WHITE FLESH in the ground

He kneels and pushes some looses soil from around the wound
in the earth revealing SKIN

Dutch walks slowly towards them He sees the flung bloody
lock of hair suspended in the tall grass He spits out the
piece of grass he was chewing on looks at the ground where
Callaghan is pushing away the soil

Callaghan’s digging reveals a WOMAN’S EYE crusted with soil
staring up at the sky

Dobie SCREAMS

The buried woman’s pupil CONTRACTS

TIME LAPSE- EXT PLAINS HUNKPAPA TRAIL- DUSK

The woman waifishly thin blonde lies on the grass Shes
in a coma and a filthy gingham dress Grass stains dirt
and dried blood mark her pale skin There is a SOFT
SCRATCHING noise off-screen like a cat pawing at a door It
sounds like its coming from inside of her

PARCHER
Shes breathing

Parcher is crouched next to her He tries to press her
eyelids down but they wont stay shut Her eyes keep
creeping open staring without motion at the dark blue sky

The other four men stand over her looking down

DUTCH
Shes not one of the Stewarts

CLAY
Then who is she

Dutch shakes his head Well call the woman AUDREY

Parcher pushes Audreys head gently to the side better
exposing a deep six-inch wound tore roughly into her neck
and shoulder Theres no blood but that inside the wound
itself thickened like raspberry jam

CLAY (RE THE WOUND)
Same as Williams wife

PARCHER
Yeah And she should have bled out
more too

Parcher leans in Small WHITE GROWTHS line the wound
clustered like frog eggs The thickened blood glistens

PARCHER
Its still moist Maybe infected

Parcher reaches out and touches gently around the angry pink
edges of the wound He pushes back the edge of Audreys
collar revealing a small GOLD CRUCIFIX on a chain

Dutch leans in to get a better look The fungal-looking
white growths surround the cross in the wound

CLAY
She got any other marks on her

PARCHER
You got eyes

Clay doesnt respond The SCRATCHING sound is still there
from somewhere inside Audrey

DUTCH
Somethings scratching

Callaghan and Dobie look at him but nobody responds
Parcher lifts one of the womans arms there are BRUISES
running up and down it More bruises on her neck

He lifts up a piece of her dress looks at the long vertical
tears and green stains on the fabric

PARCHER

Shes been drug a spell
CLAY

What else
PARCHER

What else you want John

CLAY
Did the Indians rape her

Dobies eyes bug out he gulps back shock Dutch is
listening hard the SCRATCHING sound is still audible

PARCHER
How the hell am I supposed to know

DUTCH
Something’s scratching inside her

CLAY
What are you talking about

CALLAGHAN
I hear it too

Dutch crouches down across from Parcher over Audreys face
Audreys eyes stare unmoving upward As Dutch gets closer to
Audrey the SCRATCHING gets louder

He moves down towards the fringes of her torn dress The
SCRATCHING gets louder

One of her shoes is gone The SCRATCHING is coming from
inside her other shoe

DUTCH
Its in her shoe

CLAY
Pull it off

Dutch looks at Clay then reaches for the shoe and pauses
The SCRATCHING is fervent insect-like

Dutch pulls off the shoe
Her foot is bare beneath Audreys fourth toe is wiggling
Nobodys sure how to react

Audreys toe wiggles her chest barely moves with her
breathing she stares unmoving at the sky

TIME LAPSE- EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

From beside the campfire Dutch can just barely see Parcher
and Clay standing out on the prairie past the edge of the
flickering firelight Theyre deep in conversation sharing
a bottle of whisky

Dutch is crouched over Audrey cleaning the dirt off of her
face with canteen water Callaghan sits on the ground
nearby blowing on his coffee to cool it

Dobie stands on the other side of the fire anxious kicking
at the embers He keeps looking at Audrey building up to
something

Dutch pushes Audreys head to the side and tries to wipe at
the scab sticking the gold cross to her wound Her head
keeps slipping out of his grasp To Callaghan-

DUTCH
Can you hold her head

CALLAGHAN
Naw man Im not touching her

DUTCH
She cant mind

CALLAGHAN
It aint her Im worried about

Dobie approaches from around the fire anxious He points at
Audrey-

DOBIE
Is that what rape is
DUTCH
What
DOBIE

Is that what rape is

DUTCH
No

CALLAGHAN
We dont know what them Indians did
to her

Dobie stares at Audrey thinking hard then turns sharply
away and walks out towards Parcher and Clay Callaghan blows
on his coffee

EXT PRAIRIES OUTSIDE CAMP- CONTINUOUS

Parcher and Clay speak softly low enough to escape the
others ears Dobie approaches in the background hearing
the conversation already in progress-

CLAY
-dont know anything about him
Thats the point

PARCHER

And what do we know about Dutch
CLAY

Hes white
PARCHER

But he aint American

CLAY
Im not about to leave a helpless
white woman alone with a negro we
dont know They got urges
Its scientific

Dobie hovers on the edges of their conversation hoping to be
noticed too nervous to butt in

PARCHER

Shit-fire everybodys got urges
Thats why God invented free will
morals And maybe you aint met
enough Occidentals to know it but
they got a lot more free will than
they got morals What do you want
Dobie

Dobies off guard Parcher waits Clay looks annoyed

DOBIE
Um Is that Whats rape

Parcher looks at him and grins He looks at Clay

PARCHER
Thatll do

CLAY
Hes just a boy

PARCHER
Exactly
(louder to Dobie)
Cowboy we got a job for you

EXT PRAIRIE CAMP- NIGHT

The campfire is dying down Lying awake in his blankets
Dutch stares at the small flames dancing over the embers

Callaghan Clay and Dobie are asleep in their blankets
scattered around the fire Parcher sits by Audrey with his
rifle across his knees looking out over the plains

Dutch admits he wont sleep climbs out of his blankets and
crosses to Parcher

PARCHER
Dutch Youre watch aint another
hour yet

DUTCH

I couldnt sleep

PARCHER (NODDING)
Dark business Finding that woman
means were on the right trail

DUTCH
Why would they bury her alive

PARCHER
--l dunno Its a miracle she
aint dead

DUTCH
What if they buried Maryanne

Parcher spits into the fire Dutch remains determined-

DUTCH
Well find her

They sit in silence for a few moments The fire light
reflects in Audreys eyes Dutch looks at the glint of gold
stuck in the wound on her neck

DUTCH
-What about her cross
(Parcher looks over )
Its stuck in her in the blood

Parcher peers at the cross and nods

PARCHER
-Maybe that aint good You got
religion Dutch

Parcher takes the cross between his thumb and forefinger
avoiding touching the thick red blood glistening beneath

DUTCH
I never did

Parcher pulls on the cross Its stuck in the gore pulls at
the wound Audreys torn flesh puckering

PARCHER
You should get some Might balance
the account of your upbringing

Parcher tugs and the cross RIPS free of the wound Parchers
hand jerks away unexpectedly and the gold chain around
Audreys neck SNAPS

PARCHER
Oh Shoot

Theres a dark spot in the wound where the cross was
surrounded by the faint outline of a cross in the tiny white
growths

PARCHER
Here its yours

Parcher presses the cross into Dutchs hand

DUTCH
What do I do with it

PARCHER
Hellfire I dont know Find
comfort in your maker Take this
too Its your watch

He shoves his rifle into Dutchs hand and crosses to his
blankets Dutch holds the cross and the rifle He wipes the
blood off the crucifix rubbing it clean on his jeans He
holds the cross up to the light

In the glint of the fire he can just see the small white
FUNGAL GROWTHS clinging to its surface

EXT PLAINS CAMP- MORNING

Dutch pulls tight the ropes holding Audrey to the wagon
Shes lying face-up eyes still open on piled blankets

Dobies horse is tied to the wagon The other four horses
are packed with provisions and camping gear Theyre all
getting ready to leave Parcher to Dobie-

PARCHER
Once you get to Fort Lincoln stay
with her well pick you up on our

way back

DOBIE
I could catch up with you in a day
or two

CLAY

We dont have moren a day or two
‘fore those missing are corpses
Or worse

Parcher leans in conspiratorially to Dobie

PARCHER
Wouldnt trust any other man in the
outfit to do the job

Dobie grins proud
PARCHER
Dont ride at night lest you want
to break old Sparrows leg

Parcher pats the flank of Dobies horse

DOBIE
I know it sir

Dutch looks at the rising sun still low over the horizon
then at Audreys unblinking eyes He tries to push her lids
down one more time and again they slowly slide open

CLAY
Enough Lets go

Dutch looks over everybodys mounting up

Dutch takes off his derby and puts it low over Audreys head
so that it shields her eyes

EXT PLAINS-— DAY MONTAGE

Were sinking slowly towards the ground Various shots
always lower Dobie riding South alone with the comatose
woman wearing Dutchs hat The other four RIDE HARD North

The sun climbs and we sink Bleached buffalo bones mark the
passing hours like sundials

The four riders pass the charred scrap remainders of a teepee
village at a gallop

Lower and lower the four ride into the NORTHERN PLAINS more
varied country we can see mountains in the distance The
land rises and falls is dotted with small groups of trees
scrub and silver-barked birch

SOUTHERN PLAINS- Still sinking Dobie sees FOUR FIGURES on
foot ahead walking the trail towards him

NORTHERN PLAINS- Still sinking Dutch and the others ride
into scattered birch trees almost glowing in the gloaming

We sink into the earth past PALE SHAPES that could be bones
and might be moving

BLACK ON SCREEN

EXT BIRCH FOREST- AFTERNOON

Clay and Parcher ride at the front Dutch and Callaghan at
the rear The forest is unnaturally quiet we can hear the

trees moving in the wind To Dutch-

CALLAGHAN
I dont like this quiet

CLAY
Hold your peace

Theres an urgency in his voice Parcher looks at him

CLAY
Yonder

Clay nods ahead and halts his horse A FIGURE is approaching
through the tangle of birch Parcher puts his hand on his
gun and draws his horse to a stop alongside He squints into
the forest

PARCHER
I cant see him

CLAY
Looks Sioux

Dutch and Callaghan draw to a stop along side Dutch sees
Parchers hand on his gun

DUTCH
What

CLAY
Hush

Dutch puts a hand on his gun Callaghan follows suit A
BIRD WHISTLE comes from behind them possibly a human
imitation of the sound

PARCHER
Shit They got us flanked Im
counting on you boys with young
eyes to see that man draw his gun
Dont be bashful about shooting
back if he does

The Figure gets closer coming through the trees the stick
in his hand might be a RIFLE

Another WHISTLE Dutch looks back towards the sound
nothing but the visual noise of birch trees

Dutch turns back facing forward and sees a SIOUX WARRIOR
emerge from the forest ahead barely twenty feet away The
Sioux Warrior raises his rifle

Dutch draws his pistol and FIRES The Sioux turns and
sprints back into the forest Before Dutch can fire a second
shot Clay swings a huge arm and knocks him from his horse
Dutch drops his gun and CRASHES to the ground painfully

The four horses gunshot spooked prance and turn

Callaghans horse glances a hoof across Dutchs brow with a
CRACK like wood breaking Dutch CRIES OUT and puts hands to
his bleeding head

CLAY
Goddamnit That was a greeting

Clay trots his horse a few steps forward into the birch
Parcher looks forward to him

PARCHER
We got trouble

CLAY
I expect

Dutch sits up looks at the blood on his hands Theres a
two-inch gash on his forehead

DUTCH
Im shot

PARCHER
Oh Jesus Christ amighty Walnuts
horse kicked you And you deserve
worse

Clay rides back to the group

PARCHER
So what do we do

CLAY
We keep at it

He turns to Dutch

CLAY
You so much as touch your gun
without my say so and Ill holster
it in your ass Understand

On the ground holding his bleeding head Dutch nods
EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— AFTERNOON

Dobie cautiously approaches a FAMILY OF SIOUX on foot An
OLD MAN OLD WOMAN TEENAGE GIRL and a BOY

Dobie and the family both sides nervous exchange pantomimed
greetings and trade Dobie reaches a slab of beef jerky from
the wagon and offers it The Old Man takes it nodding and
smiling He gestures and speaks softly to the Girl who
pulls a twist of tobacco from her pouch

The Old Woman at the wagons side inspects Audrey She
sees the wound on Audreys neck

Suddenly the Old Woman is TALKING fast and low in SIOUX The
Old Man steps forward and takes a look

DOBIE
Hey now Dont

Dobie puts a hand on his gun The Old Womans still TALKING
pointing at the gash with its small white growths

The Old Man turns doesnt even look at Dobie grabs the Boy
and Teenage Girl and all four walk swiftly away

Dobie confused watches them go The Sioux walk swiftly up
the trail they dont even look back

EXT BIRCH FOREST- DUSK

The world tilts uneasily around Dutch He gingerly touches
the WOUND on his head the skin angry and pink around it

The four are riding in a rough group through the trees
cautious all eyes scanning for Indians The birch have
become even more dense visibility is minimal

Parcher is riding point Clay is bringing up the rear
Callaghan pulls his horse over next to Dutchs

CALLAGHAN
You all right

DUTCH
I’ll live

CALLAGHAN

Mr Parcher told you to shoot

It’s moral support and Dutch takes it nodding

DUTCH
What does it mean to holster in
the ass

CALLAGHAN

Means he’s sweet on you

Clay suddenly appears beside them spurring his horse forward
towards Parcher Callaghan and Dutch fall silent

CLAY (TO PARCHER)
I dont like this You think that
Indian was Burrower tribe

PARCHER
Looked Sioux But there’s more
flavors of Sioux than I can count

CLAY
Why ain’t we heard of them before

PARCHER
Can’t say I expect they’1l
introduce themselves shortly The
Kraut aint made us the most
popular white men in Dakota

CLAY (NODDING)
Im libel to drop him when we get
back
PARCHER
Amen to that
DUTCH
I stay on until we find the

Stewarts

Dutch has pulled up beside Clay and Parcher He’s determined
blood flaking from his brow Clay nods assenting

PARCHER
That might not be so far off
F’that Indian you shot at wanted to
talk he wanted to trade And the
only thing he’d have we might want
is white folks

DUTCH
You mean the Stewarts

CLAY
It’s possible But we don’t trade
for whites

DUTCH
But it means we’re close

Clay nods

CLAY
Were pushing four days now they
been gone

PARCHER
Does it change anything if this is
revenge rathern rescue

DUTCH
This isn’t We can still find
her Even if she’s been hurt

Parcher looks at Clay waits for an answer

CLAY
He’s right We ain’t found bodies
We don’t sleep tonight we don’t
stop--

Clays neck EXPLODES The CRACK of a rifle Blood splatters
backwards spraying Dutch and Callaghan Jugular spray pumps
obscenely skyward as Clay falls backwards off his horse

Parchers horse bucks as he draws his revolver Dutch wipes
blood from his eyes

Callaghan draws in a breath to scream another CRACK and his
horse jerks violently backwards eyes wild Blood pours from
behind its ear and the animal falls pinning Callaghan’s
ankle beneath the saddle

Clay SLAMS onto his back on the ground blood pumping from
his neck He kicks at the earth eyes rolling in his head
Parcher grabs his rifle and jumps off his horse

More GUNSHOTS echo from the surrounding forest WAR CRIES
from every direction

Dutch scrambles off his horse Callaghans horse lying on
the ground pinwheels its legs and froths at the mouth
Callaghan pulls frantically trying to free his leg

Splinters fly off the birch trees above at the impact of
bullets BLAM BLAM and WAR CRIES Dutch fires his pistol
back wildly

Parcher crawls over Clay is fish-belly white where he isnt
bloody His eyes have stopped moving

Dutch crawls to Callaghan still pinned beneath the saddle

DUTCH
Stop pulling

Callaghan relaxes his leg Dutch lifts the saddle and
Callaghan pulls free

Parcher crawls over to Callaghans horse and SHOOTS it in the
head The horse twitches and stops moving

PARCHER
Get over here

Parcher scrambles behind the horse between it and some
deadfall finding an impromptu bunker Callaghan crawls over
to join him Dutch close behind

BLAM BLAM the gunshots continue The WAR CRIES echo from
every direction

Dutch Parcher and Callaghan lie on the ground between the
horse and the deadfall Dutch fumbles more bullets into the
chamber of his gun THUNK a bullet slams into the corpse of
Callaghans horse

Callaghan raises up with his pistol and Parcher puts a hand
on his arm stopping him

PARCHER
Dont waste your bullets Well
shoot when theyre close enough to
kill

WAR CRIES THUNK the horse twitches at the impact of
another bullet BLAM BLAM the rifle shots slow

We can hear FOOTSTEPS the CRUNCH of dry leaves

Dutch peeks out from behind the horse Clay is staring back
at him impossible to tell if the man is dead or not

A SIOUX WARRIOR emerges from the trees behind Clay carrying
a pistol and a maul Dutchs eyes widen The warrior pauses
over Clays corpse raises the maul and SKRUNCH sinks it
into Clays face nearly taking off the dead mans jaw

BLAM Dutch cringes at the sound of the rifle directly over
his head The Sioux Warrior spins and falls to the ground
with a shoulder wound

Parcher shucks another round into his rifle as he drops back
to the ground behind the horse BLAM BLAM BLAM rifle shots
and WAR CRIES answer Parchers fire

Dutch presses himself to the ground Callaghan likewise
Parcher waits gets an eye over the horse

Another SIOUX is pulling the first to his feet Parcher
springs up and BLAM shoots the second Sioux dead in the
chest Parcher drops back behind the horse

BLAM a single shot answers Scattered WAR CRIES die off

Parcher Dutch and Clay lay behind the dead horse They
realize that they are laying in a pool of horse blood
spreading crimson against the fallen silver leaves of birch

They can hear the PANTING and MOANS of pain as the shoulder-
wounded Sioux gets to his feet and runs into the forest

RUNNING the CRUNCH of dead leaves scatter in every
direction Parcher Dutch and Clay lie behind the horse and
try to catch their breath

FROM ABOVE- we see that they line up like a zodiac Three
men lying in blood behind the dead horse Clay dead on his
back in his own blood the chest-shot Sioux dead a stones
throw away Sudden silence with the cessation of gunfire

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DUSK
The plains are unnaturally quiet

Dobie softly whistles ALAS AND DID MY SAVIOR BLEED Hes
assembled a small camp fire and laid out his blankets a short
distance from the mess wagon where Audrey lies still
wearing Dutchs derby

DOBIE
I guess we can make you a might
more comfortable Dont uh
Dont think Im being forward or
nothing

Dobie approaches Audrey a little nervous He shyly grins
and lifts her from the wagon Her eyes look up at the sky

Dutchs hat falls from Audreys head and onto the ground
Dobie lays Audrey on a thick pad of blankets

DOBIE
There Now lemme

Dobie pushes a rolled blanket beneath her head like a pillow
In the strange silence of the plains we can hear the
SCRATCHING of Audreys toe in her shoe

DOBIE
Well now Right civilized

Dobie looks down at Audrey His head bobs down towards her

and he pauses He grins nervously looks around at the empty
plains Then ducks down and pecks Audrey a quick KISS on her
lower parched lip While kissing her the SCRATCHING STOPS

DOBIE
Good night

Dobie looks down at her a goofy smile on his face The
SCRATCHING in her shoe starts again Dobie furrows his brow
puzzled He looks at the shoe

He reaches out timidly and covers Audreys eyes The
SCRATCHING stops He takes his hand away the SCRATCHING
starts again

Dobie takes a breath repeats the experiment Covers her
eyes and the SCRATCHING stops uncovers and it starts again

DOBIE
Jesus Youre awake

Dobie looks like he could cry
DOBIE
Youre Im so sorry What

did What did they do to you

Dobie looks down her She stares sightlessly at the sky her
toe SCRATCHING in her shoe

Dobie moves off to his own blankets

Beneath the SCRATCHING out in the plains we can hear that
same RATTLING CREAK a soothing GURGLE

TO BLACK

PARCHER(WHISPERING VO)
Christ amighty is he asleep

EXT BIRCH FOREST- NIGHT

Dutch opens his eyes putting a hand to the angry wound
splitting his scalp and GROANING

DUTCH
Im awake

PARCHER
God damn if you aint the dumbest
white man I ever met

Theyre all still crouched between the dead horse and the
pile of fallen birch A stiff BREEZE moves through the
forest RATTLING the leaves
Dutch blearily wipes at his face Dried blood flakes
like scales

CALLAGHAN
I aint heard a thing in hours

DUTCH
How long are we gonna wait here

PARCHER
They could be waiting in ambush

They sit in the broken moonlight

CALLAGHAN
-Billys starting to smell

Parcher and Dutch look at him for clarification

CALLAGHAN
Swhat I named the horse

PARCHER
Thats my name

Small grins from Dutch and Callaghan

CALLAGHAN
I didnt know that Mr Parcher
Real sorry

PARCHER
Shit fire The horse is dead
Walnut call it what you like

off

Parcher shakes his head Then reaches out with a gloved
hand and pulls a bunch of leafy vines from the base of a
tree He squints at it in the darkness Parcher makes a

CLICKING noise in his throat thinking

PARCHER

Thats poison oak aint it
CALLAGHAN

Looks it
PARCHER

--Il tell you what Put your
gloves on pile up as much of this
stuff as you can We aint waiting
for dawn

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— NIGHT
CLOSE UP of Dobies peaceful sleeping face
A TEARING sound ripping flesh

RATTLES and HISSES something like snakes or insects Dobie
blearily opens his eyes

A shadow withdraws from over him shifting in the firelight
A SIX INCH CUT freshly gouged in Dobies neck

The FIGURE crouching over Dobie is back-lit by the fire
barely discernible It grabs Dobie by the arm and rolls him
up onto his side

Dobie struggles for a moment thrashing an arm before a
RETCHING sound precedes a HOT SPLASH of liquid hitting his
neck Dobies thrashing arm goes limp His eyes freeze
forward staring across the camp fire

Beyond the camp fire concealed by their flames THREE MORE
FIGURES like small men crouch over Audrey The shifting
firelight barely reveals them Theyre on Audrey as if
working on her They arch their backs and tug making
SLURPING noises like geriatrics sucking tapioca

The Figure over Dobie drops him and he rolls helplessly onto
his back eyes staring upwards The Figure is out of his
sight too quickly for Dobie to clearly see it Thick liquid
drips onto Dobies face and neck

Where the bile drops it STEAMS quickly away leaving tiny
WHITE GROWTHS

The RATTLING and GURLGING sounds continue Dobie is left
momentarily alone staring upwards There is fear in his
unmoving eyes

The LITTLE FINGER of his left hand WIGGLES Dobies unmoving
eyes stare upward The finger WIGGLES

THREE FIGURES return to him crouching over him blocking out
the light of the fire They cluster on the periphery of
Dobies vision THREE MORE join the crowd completely
casting Dobie into shadow A SEVENTH

Dobie is unable to turn his eyes and look at the hands that
grab onto his arms and legs Hes lifted from the ground and
suddenly moving away from camp

Tall grass flies past as hes dragged helplessly through the
planes Dobie stares up at the grass the starry sky beyond

He is dragged by the seven Figures far out into the plains
well out of the firelights range And suddenly dropped

We hear GRASS TORN from the ground The sounds of EARTH
MOVING Dobie staring upwards cannot see what is
happening The Figures PUFF and HISS as they dig pushing
earth aside

The monstrous hands roll Dobie over once twice and into a
SHALLOW PIT Dobie lands face-up in a hole in dark earth the
size of a coffin

From the edges of his vision he sees the dim outline of the
Figures pushing freshly dug earth towards him They cover
him from the feet-up in about four inches of soil They
cover his belly his chest

A thin layer of dirt is pushed over his face until only one
eye barely peeks out of the rich soil one nostril is left
free to breath

We hear the Figures turn and move off The sounds again of
GRASS TEARING and EARTH MOVING and then sudden SILENCE

In the dark soil beneath an ocean of grass Dobies eye
stares helplessly out across the plains Tiny particles of
soil around his nostril shake with his weak breathing

Several feet away from his eye a tiny patch of earth is
shaking a little bit as if a mole were trying to surface

We SINK down into that earth and several inches below it
find Dobies little finger WIGGLING

FADE TO BLACK
EXT BIRCH FOREST- PRE-DAWN

The forest is misty the first hints of sub-horizon lead-
colored light off in the distance Dutch and Callaghan are
sweating steam rising from their bodies as they work The
pile of poison oak is twenty feet long and four feet high

Nearby Parcher ties John Clays corpse to a TRAVEAU Its
like a tight hammock woven between two birch saplings tied to
the horses saddle one end left to drag on the ground

Callaghan throws another bunch of leaves onto the pile and
pauses breathing

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
They used to make us burn this shit
in Georgia

DUTCH (WHISPERING)
Yeah

CALLAGHAN
Knew a man got caught downwind and
inhaled the smoke Bled from his
lungs for two days and then died
Drowned in his own blood

PARCHER (OFF-SCREEN)
You boys about set

Dutch and Callaghan look over Parcher stands wiping his
hands on his jeans John Clays blanket-wrapped corpse is
secured to its sling

DUTCH
Were set

PARCHER
Good then get her burning and
lets go

Parcher turns towards the corpse of the dead Sioux still
lying face-up on the ground as Dutch fishes a box of matches
from his vest gives a handful to Callaghan

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
This dont seem right

DUTCH
I don’t like it either But we
don’t have time This gets us back
on the trail

Callaghan doesnt answer but strikes a match and touches it
to a twist of paper buried in the brush Dutch does the
same and soon the poison oak begins to burn and smoke

Dutch and Callaghan back quickly away covering their mouths
BLAM BLAM They both jump at the sudden sound of gunfire
They look back at Parcher who walks away from the dead
Siouxs corpse with a smoking pistol

The Siouxs eyes have been shot out of his head

TIME LAPSE- EXT BIRCH FOREST- PRE-DAWN

Dutch Callaghan and Parcher with Clays corpse in tow
ride away from the quickly growing flames behind them They

look like emissaries from hell the reflected firelight
dancing off of the trees silver bark

They ride into the forest quickly leaving sight of
Callaghans dead horse and the dead desecrated Sioux
Clays traveau bounces roughly along the ground

The wind carries the deadly yellow-tinged smoke through the
forest behind them glowing red in the fire

EXT NORTHERN PLAINS FOREST EDGE- DAY

Dutch sits on the ground using a hatchet to knock the cross-
piece of a small birch crucifix into the riser

A few yards off Callaghan and Parcher finish shoveling dirt
onto Clays grave Parcher winded lowers his shovel and
steps over to Dutch

PARCHER
Here I thought you aint had any
religion

DUTCH
Sorry

Parcher gestures at Dutchs cross

DUTCH
So well know where hes buried

Parcher nods wipes sweat from his brow and grabs an open
bottle of whisky

PARCHER
You might should think about Jesus
That Bibles done a lot of good in
the world

Dutch nods non-committal

PARCHER
--And maybe leave off that cross
If them Indians know a white mans
buried here theyre liable to dig
him up and tear out his eyes make
him blind in the spirit world

Parcher looks away his eyes shining with tears and takes a
drink Dutch stands and throws the cross towards the birch

forest The cross tumbles slowly end over end through the

sky and vanishes in the grass

Parcher sniffs and spits drinks more whisky Callaghan
finishes his work and leans on his shovel

CALLAGHAN
This mean were heading back

DUTCH (SURPRISED)
No

PARCHER
Hell no John Clayd piss on us
from heaven if we turned back now

DUTCH
And the Stewarts You said we’re
close

PARCHER

Yeah We ride night and day we
can overtake ‘em on the far side of
those woods kill the redskin that
shot John and get your woman back

Dutch mounts his horse Callaghan pauses looking down at
Clays grave

CALLAGHAN
You want to say some words for Mr
Clay

PARCHER(SHAKING HIS HEAD)
That was his job

EXT NORTHER PLAINS- DAY

The three ride hard Callaghan and Dutch have heavy bags
under their eyes Parcher smokes eyes narrow and red

TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS-— DAY

Dutch rubs his face roughly His and Callaghan’s horses have
drifted a stone’s throw behind Parcher’s The three are
riding more slowly now the need for sleep overtaking them
Callaghan looks exhausted

Ahead Parcher’s head is bowed eyes closed He’s asleep on
his horse Dutch sees it and looks at Callaghan

CALLAGHAN
How do you think he does that
Sleeps on his horse

DUTCH
I dont know

Dutch looks up at the glaring sun His skin is sunburned

DUTCH
Wish I had my hat

TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS- DUSK

Parcher’s awake again All three men are bleary-eyed and
pallid swaying with the motion of their horses They stare
ahead through heavy lids There’s a gentle PURRING rolling
in off the plains Callaghans eyes creep shut

Their three horses start to climb a rise Dutch’s horse
catches up with Parcher’s Parcher is asleep again

Dutch turns and looks back towards Callaghan

Callaghans gone the horse he was riding clops along behind
them without a rider

DUTCH
Hey Callaghan’s gone

Parcher snorts awake and looks back He’s nonchalant--

PARCHER
When did we misplaced our Negro

DUTCH
While you were sleeping

PARCHER
I wasn’t asleep

Dutch turns his horse and spurs it back a few yards

DUTCH
Callaghan Callaghan

He looks around it’s an ocean of grass the low sun casting
long shadows off the waving blades Dutch can see for miles
and there’s no sign of Callaghan at all

The PURRING continues masked slightly by the GURGLING of a
small stream nearby

Dutch looks at Parcher anxiety in his eyes Either one of
them could have vanished as easily

Dutch’s horse trots forward Dutch scanning the grass
Parcher pulls his horse forward in the background Callaghan
is simply gone the grass swallowed him whole

CALLAGHAN
-Hey

Parcher and Dutch turn No sign of Callaghan until he
wearily pushes himself up out of the grass maybe fifteen feet
away right between the two horses

PARCHER
Get Walnut back on his horse we
aint done yet

CALLAGHAN (BLEARILY )
That aint my name

Dutch gets off his horse helps Callaghan to his feet

DUTCH
You alright

Callaghan nods Dutch thinks turns to Parcher

DUTCH
The horses need water we need
sleep

PARCHER

The sun’s setting on John Clay’s
grave and his killer’s still
walking We keep riding

DUTCH
The sun’s already set We each
sleep an hour and watch one Then
back on the trail

PARCHER
Get back on your damn horses

Dutch starts unpacking his blankets from his saddle Parcher
raises his eyebrows and looks at Callaghan Callaghan shrugs
and starts unpacking his own blankets

Parcher gets off his horse pissed
EXT NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Callaghans already asleep Parcher and Dutch sit by the
fire Dutch drinks coffee Parcher stews

PARCHER
You cross me again you and Walnut
both can go to hell Id rather do
this alone than with a couple old
ladies

Dutch nods Beat Parcher spits then SIGHS

PARCHER
Hard to fathom John Clay being
dead Known that man since we were
little boys

DUTCH
--You’ve gotten people back
before Women From the Indians

Parcher looks at him sees how worried Dutch is

PARCHER
Not personally not alive But I
met a woman that come back She
weren’t never the same but she
lived

DUTCH
Well find her

Dutch looks into the fire Another moments silence

DUTCH
Ill take first watch

Parcher nods then GROANS as he gets up and crosses to his
blankets Dutch holds his rifle across his knees drinking
coffee and looking out across the plains

TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch shakes Parchers shoulder He jerks violently awake
gets a hand on his revolver before he recognizes Dutch

PARCHER
Jesus Dutch

DUTCH
Parcher its your watch

PARCHER
I aint been asleep two seconds

DUTCH
An hour More I need sleep

PARCHER
God damnit

Parcher GROANS sits up

TO BLACK

PALE SHAPES move in inky darkness RATTLES PURRING
TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch opens his eyes sees the campfire blazing unusually
high Callaghan’s blankets are empty He rolls away from
the fire and sees Parcher’s blankets empty He’s all alone

Dutch sits up fast He looks around The camp is completely
empty He grabs his pistol gets to his feet

The harsh glare of firelight reveals a circle of grass but
obscures the moonlit ocean of movement beyond

DUTCH
Callaghan Parcher

Dutch squints into the darkness He takes a step out towards
the grass and stops

Over the CRACKLING of the fire the nighttime sounds seem
amplified SHIFTING in the grass A moment of uncertainty

We see him from a distance standing vulnerable in a circle
of firelight surrounded by infinite darkness GURGLING
RATTLES slide through darkness

He tightens his grip on his pistol

FOOTSTEPS in the grass behind him Dutch spins A FIGURE
approaching

CALLAGHAN
Dutch I can’t find Parcher

The figure resolves into Callaghan Relief sweeps over
Dutch

DUTCH
Why’s the fire so big

CALLAGHAN
I woke up from the heat of it and
Parcher was already gone
Something’s up

Callaghan shakes his head Dutch rubs the sleep out of his
face He looks around It hits him

DUTCH
Hes using us The Indians see
our fire attack us Parcher sees
the Indians

CALLAGHAN
-Son of a bitch

They stand for a moment looking out into the darkness Then
Callaghan starts kicking wood away from the fire

CALLAGHAN
Spread it out well let it die
down

Dutch kicks from the other side The fires quickly lowered
Dutch and Callaghan left standing over scattered burning
logs A beat

DUTCH
Is there more coffee

Callaghan shakes his head no The insect-like PURRING
thats been rattling off the planes SWELLS

CALLAGHAN
Do you hear that

Dutch frowns straining to listen The PURRING builds and
drops hard to distinguish from the swaying of the grass

CALLAGHAN
Its almost like

His voice trails off Dutch listens A beat

Parcher SCREAMS off-screen Dutch and Callaghans heads
snap to the sound

Dutch is the first to move he grabs a burning piece of wood
and charges into the grass towards the sound of Parchers
voice into the darkness The RATTLING gets louder

On the edge of Dutchs vision three figures are crouched on
the ground Dutch throws his torch

It arcs end-over-end sailing through the air and lands in
the midst of the three A HISSING SCREAM The shower of
sparks and muted flame reveals-

TWO BURROWERS crouched over Parcher The brief light gives us
a glimpse of the creatures somewhere between a molting
beetle and a drowned child But only a glimpse

Dutch raises his rifle

The Burrowers out of the torchs light nearly invisible
slither like melted wax over the soil CRACK CRACK Dutch
fires his rifle at the creatures CRACK CRACK-

THUNK THUNK bullets strike the creatures without effect
They wiggle into the dirt and in a matter of seconds vanish
down into it

Dutch looks at the moonlit grass collapsing in CIRCULAR
INDENTATIONS where the Burrowers dug down (Just like the
indentations they’ve found on the trail)

DUTCH
What what

Dutch is on the edge of losing his shit

PARCHER
My neck

Dutch looks down Parcher has a half-inch deep seven-inch
long TRENCH carved into his neck

EXT NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Callaghan searches through the saddlebags Dutch is
standing looking out at the plains The PURRING RATTLE is
all around them Parcher sits by the fire gingerly touching
the wound on his neck

CALLAGHAN
Do we have bandages
PARCHER
It aint bleeding I cant even

feel it

Parcher presses the palm of his hand against the wound then
takes his hand way and looks at it

PARCHER
Jesus Now I cant feel my hand
What did that Indian do

DUTCH
Those werent Indians

Callaghan pulls a bottle of whiskey and a canteen of water
from the saddlebags and throws them to Parcher

CALLAGHAN
Here clean it out

Parcher ignores the water takes a drink of whiskey
Callaghan spits mutters-

CALLAGHAN
--what right you had to stake us
out like pieces of bait

PARCHER
Listen Im the one whos god-damn
cut Dutch even got a look at ‘em

DUTCH
Those werent Indians

Dutch crosses to the fire adds a handful of dead grass The
fire FLARES and in the light they can see the grass moving
around their camp RATTLES HISSES Some of the grass seems
to move against the wind

The GURGLES and PURRING comes from all directions

DUTCH
Theyre all around us

PARCHER (SLURRED)
I cant feel my face

DUTCH
I think theyre waiting for us
to go back to sleep

CALLAGHAN
Fat god-damn chance of that

TIME LAPSE- EXT PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

The campfire blazes casting a flickering orange light over
the plains The three sit in a circle with their backs to
the fire each holds a gun and watches the plains

The side of Parchers face above the wound is starting to
droop like a stroke victims They don’t look at one
another but stare out at the grass as they talk

PARCHER
Cant feel my tongue Or much of
my arm Im numb but I itch all
over I dont want to die like
this not by pieces

DUTCH
I dont think itll kill you That
woman we sent back with Dobie she
was still alive

PARCHER (CHUCKLING)
Theres cold comfort

Parcher is still excited adrenaline giving a shine to his
eyes behind his slightly slackened face Dutch looks at him
bewildered that he could find some strange pleasure in this

Dutch considers then-

DUTCH
What about Dobie

Parcher looks up sobering slightly

DUTCH
He could be out there alone with
those

PARCHER
He must be at the fort by now
(a beat)

--You still got that cross

DUTCH
Yes

Dutch fishes it out of his shirt and tosses it to Parcher
Parcher cant catch it with his numb arm has to fish around
in the dirt He picks it up and MURMURS a quick prayer
kisses the cross

CALLAGHAN
Can I get some of that

PARCHER
-Amen

Parcher kisses the cross again and tosses it awkwardly to
Callaghan Callaghan lunges catches He kisses it and
MURMURS a prayer Parcher feels the moist groove in his neck

CALLAGHAN (TO DUTCH)
Here man

Callaghan tosses the cross and Dutch catches it

DUTCH
Keep it

CALLAGHAN
What you dont believe

Dutch shakes his head

CALLAGHAN
Then you need it more than I do

PARCHER
God-damned Indian must have
poisoned the knife

Dutch pockets the cross

PARCHER
They been alone in this country
maybe a thousand years God knows
what devilment they could of
thought of in that time

DUTCH
I dont think it was an Indian that
cut you

PARCHER

Looked like men but werent
Sneaked up and cut a white mans
throat in the night Sounds Indian
to me

They fall silent The RATTLING and PURRS continue out in the
swaying grass still strangely SOOTHING Dutch looks at
Parcher’s wound Parcher beats his fist against the ground

PARCHER
Whole damn arms is numb
DUTCH

Your wound is the same as the
Williams’ dead

Parcher looks at him
DUTCH
Whoever did that is who took
Maryanne Took the Stewarts We

must be close Can you ride

Parcher nods struggles awkwardly to his feet

PARCHER
Shit Alright lets go You dont
get me on a horse soon I wont be
able to get on at all

EXT NORTHERN PLAINS-— NIGHT

They ride in a line Dutch at the lead followed by Parcher
and Callaghan All have drawn guns

The BURROWER NOISES continue from the surrounding plains
The sky is enormous filled with stars Parchers lip hangs
limp his eyes heavily lidded

Dutch rides slowly at the lead watching the grass

TIME LAPSE- EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS- PRE-DAWN

They climb a rise in the land Dutch is nodding on his
horse exhausted Parcher spurs his own horse forward
alongside the lead

PARCHER
Dutch

DUTCH
Its almost light

PARCHER
Maybe Im falling apart

DUTCH
Youll be alright

PARCHER
-If I dont make it back give
that cross to Ms Gertrude Spacks
for me Or give it to Dobie tell
him its for his mother

DUTCH
I’ll do it

PARCHER
I appreciate it

CALLAGHAN
A fire

Dutch looks over Parcher swings his head over drunkenly
Callaghan points at a dot of orange light on the horizon

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DAWN

The three riders approach FAITH an attractive 19-year-old
Sioux woman sitting alone by a small fire with her rifle

She watches them steadily with dark exhausted eyes Parcher
calls out his words drunken through his slackened face

PARCHER(SIOUX SUB-TITLED)
Friendly Peaceful

Faith looks at Parcher Her eyes darken She traces a
finger on her own neck mirroring Parchers wound-

FAITH(SIOUX ST)
You are marked Burrowers

Parcher looks at her

CALLAGHAN
Whatd she say

PARCHER
--Told us to set a spell

TIME LAPSE- EXT FAITHS CAMP- DAWN
Faiths face slightly underlit by the dying embers

FAITH(SIOUX ST)
Faithful

PARCHER(OS)
Her names Faith

Parcher Dutch and Callaghan sit around the dying fire
Parcher translates with an increasingly bleary voice

FAITH
Burrowers killed my family Last
night I shot my husband so he would
not have to suffer the feeding

PARCHER
Shes talking about the Burrowers
Says they killed her family

CALLAGHAN
Ask her what a Burrower is

PARCHER (SIOUX ST)
Burrower What tribe

Faith doesnt even look at him

FAITH
They come every third generation
We tried to escape to the East
past the Great River We were
eight

PARCHER
Burrower What is it

Faith looks at him She seems tired and angry

FLASHBACK- EXT PLAINS-— DAWN
We fly over empty plains grasslands extending forever
FAITH (VO)
They were here before white
people before humans even They
feed on buffalo

We overcome a herd of BUFFALO hundreds of them stampeding

FLASHBACK- EXT PLAINS-— NIGHT
A lone BUFFALO collapses in a heap on the plains

In the moonlight a Burrower slithers onto the Buffalos neck
and RETCHES Its indiscernible as a pale shadow

Eight Burrowers just vague shapes in the darkness roll the
Buffalo into an open pit

FAITH(VO)
They bury food let it rot The
poisoned cannot sleep

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DAWN

Dobies blue eye stares out of the soil The ground bulges
weakly over his wiggling finger

PARCHER(VO)
They use some kind of poison bury
their food alive

Particles of dirt have collected in the moisture on the
surface of Dobies horribly bloodshot eye A line of tears
traces down his cheek

EXT DOBIES CAMP- DAY
The mess wagon lays untouched in the clearing FOUR BUZZARDS
peck at Audreys corpse shriveled like a mummy A buzzard
tears her CLAVICLE free and flies away with it
EXT PLAINS-— DAY
DUTCHS DERBY blows by and out into the grass
FAITH(VO)

When the blood is thick and the

organs are soft they return and

eat They drink
FLASHBACK- EXT PLAINS-— NIGHT

Eight Burrowers half-concealed by grass surround and cover
the barely disinterred buffalo mouths fastened onto it

PARCHER(VO )
They eat soft parts

EXT FAITHS CAMP- MORNING
Parchers voice smears clumsily through his numb face

CALLAGHAN
Soft parts What does that mean

Parcher shakes his head he doesnt know

CALLAGHAN
I like my soft parts Shit

FAITH
You killed the buffalo So the
Burrowers found other food

Faith talks to the ground-
FAITH
We could not escape sleep They
took five of us A baby without a
breast to feed it died yesterday
Faith looks at Parcher
FAITH
You should die The sooner you

die the less you will suffer

Parcher doesnt translate this
PARCHER
How kill Burrowers Stop poison

Faith shakes her head

FAITH
My father said the Ute had fought
them But the Ute are as wicked as
white men they will not help

PARCHER

Ute Indians know how to kill them
DUTCH

Does she know how to stop the

poison

Parcher looks at Dutch then turns to Faith
the wound on his neck

PARCHER
Heal Make whole

Faith nods

FAITH
You can die

PARCHER
The Ute might know

CALLAGHAN
Where do we find Utes

PARCHER
There’s probably Ute scouts riding
the same route we’re on though
they avoid the trails We can find
‘em a day’s ride North There’s a
trading post the Watangwa If we
can make it there

DUTCH (INTERRUPTING)
What about the Stewarts

PARCHER
What about them

DUTCH
We can’t stop searching so you can
go after your cure

He points

at

PARCHER
We find the Utes they lead us to
the Burrower Tribe We kill the
Burrowers you get your girl go

play American

Dutch thinks not sure to trust Parcher

CALLAGHAN
Is Faith coming with us

PARCHER
Yeah That or Im shooting her

Parcher smiles at her She knows better than to smile back

TIME LAPSE

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DAY

Dutch watches the landscape roll under his horse Faith
walks along beside the three horses Parcher has lashed his
limp left hand to his saddle horn with a cord He’s grinning
excited like a kid on an Easter-egg hunt

Callaghan looks over at Faith sees that she is beginning to
limp as if afflicted with blisters

Dutch looks at Parcher is a little disturbed by the fierce
not-quite-grin on his face twisted by his slack muscles
Theres a DARK SPOT on his jaw like a BED SORE Parcher
turns his grin on Dutch who looks away

EXT NORTHERN HILLS- DAY

Trees again dot the plains The land rises and falls in
gentle swells Stone domes poke through the ground

Dutch watches Parcher up ahead A SCARLET BRUISE like a
blemish on rotting fruit marks the back of Parchers neck
Theres a sheen of yellow around it maybe liquid

Faith is now riding behind Callaghan asleep against his
back Callaghan veers his horse over towards Dutchs
Parcher is a short distance ahead out of earshot

CALLAGHAN
You see that bruise on Parchers
neck

DUTCH (NODDING)
On his face and hands too

CALLAGHAN
Hes falling apart

DUTCH
The Ute Indians will fix him

CALLAGHAN
You believe that

Dutch doesn’t answer

CALLAGHAN
Im thinking maybe I aint so eager
to risk my hide for that crazy old
shitbirds Indian cure

DUTCH
We’re not risking anything for him

CALLAGHAN
You still think you’re gonna find
your girl That Maryanne Stewart
What if that’s happening to her

Callaghan nods towards Parcher Dutch looks at the sores
slick and purple-yellow

PARCHER(OS INTERRUPTING)
Whats the ruckus back here

Parcher has slowed his horse swerves over to join them

PARCHER
Thought I mighta heard my name

CALLAGHAN
Just talking

PARCHER
You boys look bushed Were
already in Ute territory Couple
hours shy of the Watangwa

Parcher spits His voice comes out in a drunken slur

PARCHER
I didnt sleep a wink last night
Just lay there with my gun waiting
for something to move

(MORE)

PARCHER (contd)
Whatever them Indians cut me with
its got my brain racing like a
like I was a young man again I
feel lucky Makes me wish I could
move my god-damn arms

Parcher LAUGHS Its maudlin in his stroke-victim slur
Dutch and Callaghan exchange a look

FAITH(SIOUX ST)
Your wound is spotted

Callaghan starts Nobody realized she was awake She nods at
the wound on Parchers neck The wound is marked with tiny
white fungal dots

FAITH
Thats how they will find you

The grin vanishes from Parchers slackened face

CALLAGHAN
What was that

PARCHER
-Not a thing

BLACK ON SCREEN

RATTLES HISSES the Burrower PURRING Pale movement in
darkness like white worms in black soil

EXT NORTHERN HILLS WATANGWA TRADING POST - DUSK

The three horses and four riders approach a tall POLE driven
into the ground rags and feathers hanging from the top

PARCHER
Were here

Dutch and Callaghan stop their horses The pole seems to
mark the dead center of nowhere Rocky forested hills rise
up around them

The place looks like desolation like people have died here
from ambush starvation or both

DUTCH
What

PARCHER
The Watangwa We made it

CALLAGHAN

Made it There’s no “here” here

Were dead center nowhere

They’re completely alone exposed lost in the sparse trees

PARCHER

The Utes’1l come We just gotta

wait Get me off this horse my

ass feels like soggy bread

FAITH
We shouldn’t stop

Dutch gets off of his horse and looks around Callaghan
climbs off his horse nervously Faith looks at him

FAITH
No Don’t stop It’s getting
dark

Callaghan looks at her trying to understand Faith is
exhausted gestures weakly as she speaks

FAITH
They’11 kill us

Callaghan imitates her speech trying to communicate

CALLAGHAN (PARROTING)
They’1ll kill

FAITH
They’11 kill us all

This time he gets it right no idea what he’s saying-

CALLAGHAN
They’11 kill us all

TIME LAPSE- WATANGWA TRADING POST CAMP - NIGHT

CALLAGHAN (OS)
Your watch man I need sleep

Dutch blearily opens his eyes Callaghan is crouching over
him speaking low enough so only Dutch can hear

CALLAGHAN
The old mans still awake

Dutch nods and sits up from his blankets

TIME LAPSE- EXT NORTHERN HILLS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch sits by the campfire with a rifle across his knees
watching the plains The RATTLING is soft but its there
Dutch looks absolutely exhausted

PARCHER (SLURRED)
Your eyes open bud

Parcher is lying on his back by the fire heavy-lidded eyes
staring upwards The BRUISING on Parchers face is worse

spreading nearly to his left eye His left hand is nearly

black Hes rotting alive

PARCHER

Dutch You hear me Dutch
DUTCH

Im awake
PARCHER

Real good You stay that way

DUTCH
Ill tell you if I fall asleep

PARCHER
Much appreciated

Dutch throws another piece of wood onto the fire

PARCHER
You think that boy and his squaw
are gonna try to leave us

DUTCH
No

PARCHER
Id sure hate to have to shoot
somebody for trying to abandon me
out here

Dutch stirs the fire With each SWELL in the BURROWER
RATTLE Dutchs eyelids are tugged downward

PARCHER
You hear what Im saying

DUTCH
No Im asleep

Parcher grins with the half of his mouth he can move The
PURRING from out in the grass swells Dutchs eyes go a
little glassy

Dutch yawns Parcher grins The Burrower PURRING swells
again tugging at Dutchs consciousness Dutch lets his lids
droop downward A beat

The CLICK of a cocked his pistol Dutchs eyes snap open-

Parcher is turned watching the grass on the edge of camp

behind them It MOVES against the wind in time with the

Burrower RATTLING Parchers revolver weaves drunkenly at
the movement Dutch raises his rifle

The two gun barrels track the grass movement slowly across
the circumference of camp Neither Parcher nor Dutch notices
behind them-

A PALE FIGURE rising from the earth on the far side of camp
between Callaghan and Faith The RATTLING grows

The grass moving before Dutch and Parcher pauses then cuts
back the way it came Stalks of grass collapse

Background out of focus- The Burrower stalking Callaghan
arrives over him and draws back a clawed hand Loose earth
falls from its back and PATTERS softly on the ground

Dutchs eyes dart back at the sound He YELLS and spins
raising the rifle Callaghan opens his eyes and SCREAMS

CRACK CRACK Dutch fires The second bullet hits the
Burrower and it HISSES retreating into the grass

The grass behind Parcher and Dutch collapses and a SECOND
BURROWER emerges slinking swiftly towards Dutch

Callaghan scrambles to his feet likewise Faith

BLAM Parcher fires his pistol limply into the earth nearly
throwing the gun from his rotting hand Dutch turns at the
sound and finds-

A GAPING MAW A toothless mouth as big around as a babys
head strung with mucous and bile like a hole punched in a
sheet of melted cheese

The Burrowers head is mottled yellow and brown flesh the
eyes tiny subterranean pink too far apart The flesh is
plated but soft like a boiled insect

Dutch throws himself backwards towards the fire CRACK
CRACK firing his rifle into the creature It jerks
backwards HISSING

Callaghan grabs his pistol off the ground Faith scrambles
towards the fire

Parcher turns drunkenly towards Callaghan and raises his
pistol Movement in the grass behind Callaghan

Dutch fires CRACK CRACK into the Burrower before him as it
insinuates itself into the earth and vanishes

BLAM BLAM Parcher fires his pistol at the Burrower behind
Callaghan BLAM on Parchers third shot Callaghan YELLS
and drops holding his leg

Faith grabs the dropped pistol

Sudden silence but for Callaghans PAINED BREATHING and the
dwindling PURR of the retreating Burrowers

DUTCH
Callaghan

Dutch runs to him He pulls his belt tight around
Callaghans leg staunching the flow of blood

PARCHER
Did you see those things Jesus
Christ

Parcher is glassy-eyed excited gun in hand barely able to
prop himself up Hes almost laughing

CALLAGHAN
You shot me goddamnit

Dutch struggles to tie off the impromptu tourniquet his
hands slick with blood Callaghan HISSES in pain

PARCHER
I saved your life boy

Callaghan holds his bleeding leg and stares at Parcher

FAITH
Put more wood on the fire

PARCHER
Put wood on the fire she says

Dutch picks up his rifle in one hand and uses the other to
toss more wood on the fire The firelight jumps but does
little to penetrate the forested hills

FAITH
We should go We should keep
moving They’1ll find him by his
wound

She points at Parcher
FAITH
We leave him he’s already dead
We need to go

Dutch looks at Faith shakes his head-—

DUTCH
I don’t understand

FAITH
We must go We keep moving or we
die

DUTCH (TO PARCHER)
What’s she saying

PARCHER
Nonsense The squaw’s hysterical

Dutch shakes his head He takes Faith’s hands and lifts
them He gestures

DUTCH
Use hands Sign

PARCHER
Oh great Christ

Dutch ignores him Faith gestures to Callaghan Dutch and
the horses then makes a moving gesture thrusting a hand
back out of the trees

CALLAGHAN
She wants us to go

Callaghan Parcher and Faith are all looking at Dutch His
decision is going to determine their course

DUTCH
What do you think

PARCHER
No You’re not gonna listen to
that red-skinned bitch

Dutch looks at Parcher makes his decision

DUTCH
She knows more than we do
(to Callaghan)
Can you ride

CALLAGHAN
I dont know If you get me ona
horse yeah maybe

PARCHER
Like hell

Parcher dumps the spent cartridges from his gun He shoves a
fresh round into one the five chambers

Dutch starts towards him Parcher shuts the breach and
raises the pistol Dutch stops

PARCHER
Were staying right god-damn here

Dutch looks at him he’s only six steps away and Parcher’s
barely able to lift the pistol He steps forward

Parcher pulls the trigger CLICK Dutch lunges forward
Parcher pulls the trigger CLICK And again

Dutch yanks the gun out of his hand before the hammer can
fall Parcher flails his arm and YELLS like a toddler ina
tantrum (Like a half-paralyzed rotting toddler ina
tantrum) He catches his breath then-

PARCHER
God damn you to hell Dutch
EXT NORTHERN HILLS- NIGHT
The four riders lope along in a line Faith behind Callaghan
at the lead nearly holding him in the saddle Parcher
slumped on his horse hands tied at the wrist to the pommel

Dutch brings up the rear weary

Their horses pick their way slowly through the darkness
Callaghan sweats grimacing with each bounce of his horse

Dutch watches the moonlit landscape silvery and dim

PARCHER
You boys better hope to God I die

Nobody answers

FAITH
More blood is coming

She says it to Callaghan gesturing to his leg Blood is
dribbling off the heel of his boot Hes near the point of
falling unconscious He pauses calls out-

CALLAGHAN
-Dutch We gotta do something
about my leg

He reins his horse to a halt Ahead Parcher grins through
his stroke-victim face

EXT NORTHERN HILLS GULCH- NIGHT

Dutch adjusts the flame on a second lantern the two small
fires together casting an ellipse of weak light

He leaves his rifle by the lanterns stands and crosses to
Callaghans horse which Faith holds by the reigns

DUTCH
Here

Dutch reaches up and helps Callaghan off the horse
Callaghan leans heavily on Dutchs shoulders grimacing and
hissing with pain He YELLS when his left leg touches
ground His right leg hangs limp soaked with blood

Parcher watches almost amused Then he looks past them out
into the darkness

Suddenly yelled from outside the firelight-
UTE VOICE(0S YELLING)
Good Indian Peaceful Good
Indian

All eyes snap towards the sound

Dutch looks at his rifle Its ten feet away by the
lanterns he cant grab it without dropping Callaghan

TWO UTE WARRIORS walk into the circle of lantern light One
is Tall the other Short The short one points at himself

SHORT UTE
Good Indian
(Ute st)
Are you able to speak

Nobody responds Both Ute are armed with RIFLES slung around
their backs The Shorter Ute has three BEARTRAPS on his belt

SHORT UTE
No English

Dutch looks towards his rifle then back at the Ute

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
Drop me Get the rifle

FAITH(SIOUX ST)
Ute

PARCHER
Praise God He sent us some Utes
I dont know any Ute words

SHORT UTE
Frangais

DUTCH (FRENCH ST)
Yes I speak French

SHORT UTE(FRENCH ST)
Good To speak French We
good Indian Friends

DUTCH
We look for a missing white
family Burrowers took them

The Tall Ute leans down and MURMURS something to the Short
one He nods towards Parcher

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
Get your rifle

DUTCH(LOW TO CALLAGHAN)
Can you stand

CALLAGHAN
Drop me

The Short Ute addresses Dutch again pointing at Parcher

SHORT UTE
Dead man We are to fix Little
fish We come from south We
hunt Little fish to hunt with

DUTCH
He says they can fix you
Something about a small fish
I dont understand

The Tall Ute is moving towards Parcher

PARCHER
Stay back Tell him to stay back

The Short Ute shows his palms trying to calm Parcher The
Tall Ute keeps advancing He pulls a bundle of TROPHIES from
his belt hanging on a loop of rawhide They are trinkets
jewelry snatches of cloth

TALL UTE
Little fish We use the sick as
Little fish understand

He shakes the bundle of trophies

TALL UTE
From the sick

DUTCH
He keeps saying Little Fish

PARCHER (REALIZING)
Jesus Christ amighty Hes talking
about bait

CALLAGHAN
Drop me

The Tall Ute reaches up and grabs the ropes binding Parchers
wrists to the saddle

Dutch drops Callaghan and dives for his rifle Callaghan
CRIES OUT in pain

Parcher gives a slurred YELL as hes yanked off the horse and
onto the ground the Tall Ute holding him Parcher flails at
the Tall Ute knocking the hoop of trophies from his hand

The trophies fall to the ground

Dutch gets a hand around his rifle when BLAM the earth is
kicked up two feet from him Faith SCREAMS The Short Ute
is pointing his rifle at him

SHORT UTE
To take the Little Fish We fix

Dutch stays frozen over his rifle Callaghan half-lies on
the ground holding his bleeding leg

PARCHER
Shoot this son of a bitch Pick up
your god-damned rifle and shoot
this son of a bitch

Shoo zis sunuvabish is how the words come out slurred
almost beyond understanding by now The Short Ute holds his
rifle on them as the Tall Ute drags Parcher across camp and
past him into the darkness

SHORT UTE
Little Fish already dead Little
Fish for trap To kill

PARCHER (OVERLAPPING)
God damn you Dutch Dont let
them take me You killed me you
son of a bitch

Parcher and the Tall Ute are already out of the light of the
fire and out of sight The Short Ute holding the rifle on
them begins to back out of the firelight

SHORT UTE
We are to fix We are to kill

The Short Ute backs into darkness and vanishes

Dutch stares into the darkness the Short Ute could still be
just beyond the firelight still pointing the rifle

CALLAGHAN
Are they gone

DUTCH
I dont know

A beat Dutch is the first to move He crouches down and
picks up the loop of trophies

FAITH
We leave He is already dead We
leave now

A dozen trinkets taken from dead settlers belt buckles
jewelry crosses In between each trinket there hangs a
small grayish-white bone like half of a child’s jaw
toothless non-human

CALLAGHAN
I hope you’re not thinking of going
after him

DUTCH
They said they could fix him Or
trap

Dutch falls silent staring at the trinkets in his hand His
mouth opens a little tears shine in his eyes

DUTCH
Oh god

In Dutch’s hand hanging from the Ute’s trophy cord is
Maryanne Stewart’s BROOCH Dutch leans against the horse and
closes his eyes Callaghan watches him

CALLAGHAN
Dutch

Dutch takes a breath

DUTCH
Shes dead

He stares off into the trees Several moments- Dutch looks
on the edge of falling apart exhausted heart-broken
Callaghan waits to speak-

CALLAGHAN
Let’s go

DUTCH
I have to go after Parcher

CALLAGHAN
Like hell you do That sunuva
bitch was dead ‘fore them Indians
even touched him

DUTCH
It’s not for him We don’t know
how to heal the Burrowers poison
We don’t know to kill them

CALLAGHAN
I want to go home

We can see that Dutch wants to go home just as badly He
puts the brooch in his pocket He takes a breath

DUTCH
They took Maryanne from her home
Home isn’t safe

Callaghan looks at him Dutch holds his gaze Callaghan
wearily nods

TIME LAPSE- EXT NORTHERN HILLS GULCH- NIGHT
Dutch pulls Parchers pistol from his saddle

Callaghan pushes himself painfully into a sitting position
against a saddle lying on the ground Faith paces nearby
watching the edges of camp She throws another piece of wood
on the fire Dutch crosses to Callaghan and crouches

DUTCH
You be alright

CALLAGHAN
No You hurry back I think
she’ll watch out for me but

Callaghan gestures towards Faith Dutch stands crosses to
Faith and hands her Parcher’s rifle

DUTCH
Stay Watch out for him

Dutch points at Callaghan Tries to pantomime the sentence
Faith takes the rifle and nods slightly

CALLAGHAN (TO DUTCH)
Be careful

Dutch takes up his own rifle and nods again He looks
frightened but determined He takes a breath and walks away
from camp out of the light of the fire

EXT NORTHERN HILLS- NIGHT
The starlight shines somewhere between silver and lead
everything nearly black and white in the dim illumination

It could be a daguerreotype Luminous white-barked birch

Dutch moves through the trees cautiously rifle in one hand
and pistol in the other He squints into the darkness

WIND moves the small trees shifting shadows dancing over the
blowing grass Burrower RATTLES come and go from seemingly
every direction

TIME LAPSE

Dutch moves deeper into the trees He seems to be moving
towards and away from the Burrower RATTLE at the same time

RUNNING FOOTSTEPS crunch dead leaves Dutch spins just as-
The Short Ute arrives and CLOCKS Dutch across the face with
the butt of his rifle Dutch drops his rifle and falls to
the earth The Short Ute lands on top of him hand clamped
over his mouth

SHORT UTE(FRENCH ST)
Silence

CLICK of a revolver being cocked The Ute looks down
Dutchs revolver is pointed at his chest BLAM
The Ute falls backwards dead before he hits the ground

Dutch scrambles to his feet The Ute doesnt move Silence
his smoking gun He looks around Nobody but the dead Ute

Parcher MOANS from somewhere nearby Its a low weak sound
nearly a death-rattle

Dutch turns and runs in a crouch towards the sound He keeps
his head low pistol and rifle ready He jogs through small
trees CRUNCHING through dead leaves rises a hill and finds-
EXT NORTHERN HILLS CLEARING- NIGHT

A bare expanse of rocky earth surrounded by trees

Dutch passes a pile of SHARPENED POLES 12-foot birch spears
lying piled at the clearings edge

In the center Parcher is lying face-up on a slab of rock
his arms and legs bound by ropes pegged to the ground
Burrower PURRS and RATTLES surround the clearing

Dutch moves cautiously out towards Parcher

PARCHER
Jesus Dutch Thank God

Dutch leans down over him and unties Parchers good arm

PARCHER
They put something in me Made me
drink

DUTCH

Drink What was it

Dutch reaches across to untie Parchers rotten arm Parcher
glances past Dutch and GASPS

Dutch follows Parchers eyes glancing over his shoulder

Parcher LURCHES upward and GRABS the pistol from Dutchs
waist pointing it at the TALL UTE suddenly behind Dutch

BLAM Parcher FIRES the gun inches from Dutchs face The
muzzle flash SEARS across Dutchs eyes he falls backwards

A bullet wound PUNCTURES the belly of the Tall Ute
DUTCHS POV- Washed-out overexposed a RINGING in his ears

Dutch stumbles backwards holding his flash-blinded eyes
His left foot pushes through a pile of dead leaves and SNAP
a BEAR TRAP springs up biting his ankle

Dutch SCREAMS and falls to the ground

The Tall Ute is half crab-walking half dragging himself
away bleeding heavily from the gut Parcher holds the
pistol on him blearily his arm swaying

Dutch is close to shock his POV bleached nearly white

The Ute near the edge of the clearing lets himself
collapse holding his belly Parcher lets the pistol drop
and lies back on the rock

Dutch wedges his fingers beneath the jaws of the bear trap
He pulls straining The jaws begin to separate then a
fingernail tears and the trap SNAPS shut again

DUTCH (PAIN)
Shit

FROM ABOVE- The Ute lies bleeding near the clearings edge
Parcher lies tethered by three points to a rock Dutch sits
struggling to free his leg from the bear trap SIX
INDENTATIONS appear in the rocky soil churning

SIX BURROWERS emerge into the clearing They slink like
cats moving on all fours

They cast their heads towards the Ute and Dutch then focus
in on Parcher and spiral in towards him

Parcher is the first to see them He GASPS

Parcher weakly lifts the dropped gun and BLAM fires once
before the first two Burrowers are on him

Dutch looks up at the sound just in time to see the other
four Burrowers FLING themselves onto Parcher They fasten
their gaping maws onto his body like piglets on a sow

Parcher opens his mouth to scream but the only sound that
comes out is the dying WHEEZE of a broken bellows The
Burrowers arch their backs and suck SLURPING the rotten
organs from Parchers body

A Burrower pulls its pale head away from the buffet its face
dripping with blood and gore as if fresh from a pie-eating
contest It swings its head towards Dutch

Dutch still tethered by the bear trap looks at the
creature It HISSES with a blood-and-mucous strung mouth

Dutch crabwalks backwards away from the Burrower pulling
the traps tethering chain nearly taught before he FREEZES
He looks down at his left hand a SECOND BEAR TRAP waits
beneath a thin covering of leaves

The Burrower starts slinking towards him The thick yellow
nails on its three-fingered hands drip white venom

Dutch looks from the bear trap blocking his path to the
approaching creature It’s ten feet away It tenses to
pounce HISSING then FLINGS itself at Dutch

Dutch YELLS and catches the Burrowers hand the dripping
talons inches from his neck He twists pushing the creature
onto the SECOND BEAR TRAP

The trap SNAPS CRUNCHING into the Burrowers side The
Burrower ARCHES and SCREACHES in pain

Dutch rolls away and from the ground grabs a STICK arm-
length about two inches around He wedges it into the jaws
of the trap holding his ankle and pries it apart

The trapped Burrower arms length from Dutch LUNGES at him
swiping Dutch YANKS his leg free and rolls away the
venomous claw missing him by inches

TALL UTE (UTE SUB-TITLED)
No

Dutch looks over Another BURROWER is slinking towards the
gut-shot Ute talons dripping The Ute cries out

Dutch LURCHES to his feet his wounded ankle nearly giving
out and limps to intercept the creature before it reaches
the Ute

One of the Burrowers still feeding on Parcher suddenly lifts
its head and HISSES It stumbles back from Parcher
drunkenly and then collapses to the ground

The other three Burrowers raise their bloody maws from
Parchers drained corpse and look over The unconscious
Burrower lies on the ground sucking small shallow breaths
like an asthmatic child

The Burrower bearing down on the wounded Ute weaves
drunkenly but is only paces away PANTING with pain Dutch
grabs a SHARPENED POLE from the pile on the ground

The Burrower raises back a claw ready to swipe at the Ute
Dutch lunges PLUNGING the birch pole through the Burrowers
torso and into the ground below The creature SCREECHES

The bear-trap Burrowers eyes are closed it pushes weakly
against the ground

The three Burrowers over Parcher stumble away drunkenly
The Burrower speared to the ground wearily lolls its head

DUTCH
-You poisoned them

The Ute breathing through clenched teeth almost grins

One-by-one the Burrowers collapse blearily to the ground
unconscious Barely standing Dutch watches them fall

All six creatures lie unconscious smeared with Parchers
dark blood breathing shallowly

Dutch tries to catch his breath

Parchers body is an empty husk pale white and mummified
His chest and belly collapsed like a sunken soufflé

DUTCH
Heavenly god

The gut-shot Ute is weakly trying to CALL OUT

Standing over an unconscious Burrower Dutch gets our first
real clear look at the creatures
Humanoid Three thick fingers on each hand ending in thick
black curled nails A half-dozen small vestigial beetle-
looking TALONS like Alaskan crab legs line its torso
beneath the arms

It has tiny puckered eyes Mucous-strung mouths as big
around as softballs Completely hairless A soft
exoskeleton like a molting insects over mottled rotten-
looking flesh a stark contrast against the crimson stains on
their cheeks and chins

Gooey strings of Parchers blood blow in and out of the
things mouths in time with their RASPING BREATH

The Tall Ute CALLS OUT to Dutch barely more than a directed
MOAN Dutch looks over

The Tall Utes tunic is nearly black with blood in the
moonlight The Ute points across the clearing

Dutchs gaze follows the Utes hand to the pile of BIRCH
SPEARS the sharpened poles at the clearings edge

Dutch picks one up The Tall Ute nods and points at the
Burrower Dutch speared pinning to the ground Then he
points at the other unconscious creatures pantomiming
thrusting spears into them

Dutch limps over to the nearest Burrower holds the spear
over it and looks at the Ute The Ute nods desperately

Dutch kicks the Burrower onto its back raises the spear and
PLUNGES it downward into the things chest

The Ute pumps his fist pantomiming driving the stake down
deeper Dutch twists the spear and pushes it through the
Burrower down several feet into the ground

The Burrower twists with the pressure and BILE dribbles from
its mouth

The Ute looks towards the East where the first gray light of
dawn is appearing He turns back to Dutch and points at the
other Burrowers

Dutch nods limps over and grabs two more spears
He kicks the second Burrower onto its back and drives the
stake through its chest and into the ground He drives a

stake into the third Burrower

The Ute nods relieved and collapses onto his back PANTING
Dutch impales the fourth Burrower The fifth and the sixth
Dutch stands the Burrowers are STILL BREATHING Blood and
mucous shakes on their lips with every exhale

DUTCH

It didnt work
(French st)
It didnt work

The Ute doesnt look at him

DUTCH

Theyre still alive

The Ute doesnt respond Dutch is
exhausted and all fucked up looks
like hes about to cry He walks
over to Parcher Parchers corpse
looks frail as a baby bird

Dutch crouches down and grabs
Parchers corpse from under the
arms He lifts him and starts to
drag him away

He pulls him back six or seven feet
before Parchers boot catches on a
rock Dutch pulls and Parchers
withered left arm TEARS OFF

Dutch falls onto his ass with the
mummified limb in his hand He
YELLS and drops it scrambles

backwards

and comes to a rest

sitting on the ground
Dutch sits there He stares at the

ground

He looks at the gut-shot

Ute lying on the ground Dutch
looks back at the ground and sits
SUNLIGHT hits him Dutch looks up
The first rays of dawn cresting the

horizon

The ASTHMATIC WHEEZING quickens
becomes more urgent

like a DOG WHISTLE
it to the ground

The Burrowers are stirring limbs moving over the ground
The sun climbs a little higher over the horizon Light is
now falling directly on the six creatures

They WHEEZE and HISS there is a faint SIZZLING One
Burrower opens its maw and lets loose a high-pitched sound

It raises its arms to the spear pinning

The others come fully awake HISSING and SCREAMING

Dutch watches The Burrowers skin pulls tight in the
sunlight STEAM rises off of it
A Burrower digs at the ground uselessly scratching at the
earth

TINY BLISTERS appear on their yellowish flesh

A Burrower SCREAMING pulls at the stake pinning it to the
ground actually lifting itself off the earth

The gut-shot Ute watches with fierce satisfaction

Burrower skin SIZZLES and CRACKS in the sunlight BILE
bubbles up from their mouths They STEAM and SCREAM flesh
falls from their bodies in blistering scraps The Burrowers
writhe on the ground their flesh burning away Huge
BLISTERS rise and break

Dutch watches as they SCREAM and fall to pieces

By the time its done the Burrowers’ corpses look like BURNT
CHILDREN staked to the earth

Dutch bathed in sunlight sitting on the ground between
Parchers corpse and Parchers arm wipes the tears from his
eyes with bloody hands

FADE TO BLACK
EXT NORTHERN HILLS CAMP- DAWN
Callaghan is sitting and Faith pacing where we left them

Dutch holding the Utes arm around his shoulder stumbles
into camp The Utes feet barely drag on the ground his
whole torso dark with blood Hes pale but conscious

TIME LAPSE- MORNING

They have the Ute laid out on blankets taking shallow
breaths Faith is gently tying strips of blanket around the
still-seeping wound in his stomach

Callaghan and Dutch sit nearby Dutch drinks coffee

DUTCH
It was sunlight Burned them
alive The Ute poisoned them Put
something in Parcher that would
make the Burrowers sleep

CALLAGHAN
Parchers dead
(Dutch nods)
Ill miss him
Its not a convincing performance A beat then-

DUTCH
I dont know what the poison was

Callaghan looks at the gut-shot Ute

CALLAGHAN
Can he talk

DUTCH
I dont think so If he dies we
wont find the poison

CALLAGHAN
Shit Nothings easy

DUTCH
I can make it to Fort Bismark and
back with a doctor in two days

CALLAGHAN (RE THE UTE)
You think he can live that long

DUTCH
I dont know What about you

CALLAGHAN
-Get to it The longer you wait
the deader we get And you better
stay dead South You miss that
fort by a few miles you’1ll be lost
for days

Dutch nods with heavy eyes He wants nothing but sleep

CALLAGHAN
And if you gotta sleep sleep in
the day you hear me

DUTCH
I won’t sleep

Faith her hands red with the Utes blood watches Dutch and
Callaghan Callaghan reaches out a hand Dutch takes it and
they shake

Faith cradles the wounded Ute’s head in her lap He blearily
tries to speak but can’t Faith is close to tears

The Ute weakly points at Callaghan and Dutch then covers his
ears with his hands Tears roll down his face Faith
cradles his head in her lap
EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS- MORNING

The rising sun finds Dobies blue eye slightly clouded over
staring up at the deep blue sky

EXT NORTHERN PLAINS TO SOUTHERN PLAINS- VARIOUS MONTAGE

POUNDING HOOVES From morning to noon to night Dutch pushes
his horse hard across the sparse plains Clay’s horse
galloping on a rope tied behind He switches horses to keep
up his speed eyes raccooned with exhaustion

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— NIGHT

Dutch rides exhausted world tilting carnival around him
Burrower RATTLES swell out of the grass around him The small
GOLD CRUCIFIX marked with WHITE GROWTHS bounces inside
Dutch’s breast pocket The grasslands are watching him

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DAWN
A red sun crests the horizon
ON THE GROUND- Dobie’s eye stares out over the plains

DOBIE’S POV- through the grass Dobie sees a horse and rider
approaching

UNDERGROUND- Dobie’s finger wiggles furiously

The rider is crossing Dobie’s sight diagonally He gets
close enough that we can see that it’s Dutch We see hope in
Dobie’s unmoving eye Underground his finger wiggles
desperately

ON DUTCH- He reins his horse to a stop forty feet from Dobie
looking down at the grass He grins a little bit and we seen
what got his attention-- Dutch’s HAT suspended in the grass
He swings down grabs the hat and jams it onto his head

ON THE GROUND- Dobie watches Dutch climb back on his horse
and ride away

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS- AFTERNOON

Dutch stands waving his arms at a MILITARY TRAIN a dozen

Bluecoat soldiers and a mess wagon marching Northward TWO
RIDERS break away from the train and head towards him
INT ARMY BARRACKS-— NIGHT

CLOSE UP on Dutchs face exhausted but at least cleaned up
eating He watches the OFFSCREEN SOLDIERS talk-

SOLDIER(OS)
I cant rightly say sir He says
Will Parcher was killed and
another man named Clay

LIEUTENANT (0OS)
Does he know the tribe that
attacked him

SOLDIER(OS)
No sir Hes a foreigner sir
Might be simple

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS- MORNING

Dutch sits on a wagon his left ankle thickly bandaged Hes
cleaned up in fresh clothes A black DRIVER and a DOCTOR
sits in the wagon behind them Six BLUECOATS ride alongside
along with an OGLALA SCOUT

Dutch holds a cane across his lap and watches the prairie
ahead of them anxious to return to his friends-

EXT NORTHERN HILLS MILITARY CAMP- DUSK
Faith and the Tall Ute hang dead from an impromptu GALLOWS

The blood from his stomach wound tracing his legs show that
the Tall Ute was still alive when they strung him up

Dozens of BLUECOATS mill around setting up camp

Standing by the wagon leaning on his cane Dutch stares
slack-jawed at Faith and the Tall Utes corpses His eyes
shine with tears

Campfires burn all around him throughout the trees a
pleasant glow in the quickly fading light

HENRY VICTOR(OS)
Parchers German Hey Parchers
German

Dutch turns Henry Victor walks quickly and warmly towards
him rubbing his hands together with satisfaction
HENRY VICTOR
My god man They told me you were
here Im afraid you were too late
for Will Parcher

DUTCH
I know

HENRY VICTOR
What the hell’d them Indians do
We buried him proper though Man
was wisern I gave him credit
Took four days and no small pain to
get them Sioux to tell us what
Parcher guessed right off Weve
got scouts routing out the Ute to
the North as we speak Were able
to clear just about every last one
of them from this land Reglar
Indians they could whoop to beat
the band but cant fight for shit

DUTCH
Wheres Callaghan

HENRY VICTOR
Who now

DUTCH
He was your cook He was with

HENRY VICTOR
Walnut He would have owed me his
life if he had survived

DUTCH
What

HENRY VICTOR

Amputated his leg and he up and
died on us Man was delirious
hallucinating never really woke

Tears creep down Dutchs cheeks Henry Victors talking to
himself barely notices Dutch is there

HENRY VICTOR
‘Course we never did find them
Stewarts Doubt we ever will were
probably dead before we even
started looking I guess all we
can really do is make sure it never
happens again
Dutch looks at the ground crying

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS- MORNING

Dutch rides Parchers horse away from a dozen BLUECOAT
SOLDIERS riding South

EXT WASHBURNE CRICK - DAY

We see the settlement from out in the plains alone ina
world of grass The houses are still unoccupied

We tilt down and reveal six SUNKEN PATCHES in the ground
They’re graves recently robbed If we look closely we can
see scraps of bone and withered skin in the grass A piece
of lace from one of the Stewart children’s nightgowns

They were buried less than a 14 mile from their homes

EXT THE SPACKS HOUSE- DAY

Dutch rides towards the large Victorian home He eyes the
approaching home with trepidation

EXT THE SPACKS HOUSE PORCH- DAY

Gertrude wiping her hands on her apron opens the door and
finds Dutch standing with his hat in hand Dutch inhales to
begin speaking

INT GERTRUDES PARLOR- DAY

Dutch perches uncomfortably on a wing-back chair as Gertrude
WEEPS softly sitting on the sofa opposite

This has been going on for some time Dutch holds his hat on
his knees moving his hands along the brim

The GOLD CRUCIFIX dangles by its chain from Gertrudes hands
Gertrude gets control wipes at her face with a kerchief

GERTRUDE
Have you had lunch Mr Leijderova

EXT THE SPACKS HOUSE- AFTERNOON
Dutch carries a picnic basket walking next to Gertrude who

carries a blanket They walk towards the box elder tree
where the earlier picnic took place
GERTRUDE
Dobies still alive

DUTCH
I think so too

GERTRUDE
Its not a thinking matter A
mother would know My son will
come back to me

The GOLD CRUCIFIX is looped around Gertrudes neck

GERTRUDE
Do you like pineapple
DUTCH
I dont know
GERTRUDE
I think you will Parcher loved
pineapple
She pauses
GERTRUDE

I’m sorry about Maryanne

(Dutch nods)

Her poor family I dont want to
feel guilty I think our duty is to
live as well as we can It gives
reason to the sacrifices that men
like Parcher and you made A lot of
Americans died so we could make a
life here It would be a sin if we
didnt

They arrive in the shade of the Box Elder Gertrude fingers
the gold cross It’s still spotted with tiny WHITE GROWTHS

EXT THE SOUTHERN PLAINS- NIGHT

The grass moves in amber waves across the slowly sloping
land The cloudless sky casts clear stark starlight down
onto the plains Dobie is pulled from the earth by a dozen
hungry hands He’s still alive still awake when the feeding
begins

THE END
