translation in an accented male voice of everything Olive
says with a delay between what Caden says and Olives
response as she listens in translation

now sickly and decayed flower tattoos

flower petals watching the world pass by People are sick
angry Some people wear gas masks Government vehicles with
strange symbols and gun turrets drive by A woman walks a
naked man on a leash He defecates on the sidewalk A wild-
eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden As
he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him Caden
sees the t-shirt has a little dot a painting from Adeles
show Its a moment in time a street scene very much like
the one Cadens in In the painting a man in a white t-
shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden The
flower petals blow away Caden tries to limp after them

aimlessly Various passersby on the street have hacking
coughs Tammy steps out of the bathroom meanders over to
the directors table Hazels sweater is on Michaels chair-
back She casually pulls it off and tries it on Caden

woman with Parkinsons fiddling with Rosary beads a well-
dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite A
minister addresses the mourners

MINISTER

Everything is more complicated than
you think You only see a tenth of
what is true There are a million
little strings attached to every
choice you make you can destroy
your life every time you choose
But maybe you wont know for twenty
years And youll never ever trace
it to its source And you only get
one chance to play it out Just try
and figure out your own divorce
And they say there is no fate but
there is its what you create
Even though the world goes on for
eons and eons you are here for a
fraction of a fraction of a second
Most of your time is spent being
dead or not yet born But while
alive you wait in vain wasting
years for a phone call or a letter
or a look from someone or something
to make it all right And it never
comes or it seems to but doesnt
really And so you spend your time
in vague regret or vaguer hope for
something good to come along
Something to make you feel
connected to make you feel whole
to make you feel loved

And the truth is Im so angry and

the truth is Im so fucking sad

and the truth is Ive been so

fucking hurt for so fucking long

and for just as long have been

maybe because no one wants to hear

about my misery because they have

their own and their own is too

overwhelming to allow them to

listen to or care about mine
