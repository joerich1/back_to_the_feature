SHOOTING DRAFT

INT TRIBECA LOFT - DAY
The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust

of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere An eerie
netherworld envelops us Strange ghostly forms appear

disappear in the distance They seem like apparitions
Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the
light We see hints of a huge demolished space

An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN Momentary
of light flash across it SOUNDS of street traffic are
dimly in the distance

With startling impact the SOUND of a sledgehammer
out of nowhere The wall shudders

HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience They are loud and
The wall buckles

Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor The air fills
swirls of white dust The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO

Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks piercing the
atmosphere like searchlights in a fog A huge section

wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into
air We hear voices talking

I told you
Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures
the other side of the wall all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS

SAM

One of the figures adjusts something over his face
rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows
the air

forehead and handsome features Sweat is dripping down

brow leaving streaks in the dust CARL BRUNER early

fashionable two-day stubble Both men have their shirts

ANGLE

BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD Suddenly a shaft of light
We see

yank

Huge

astonished

with

tie and

penetrates the darkness Another thud and more light

a hole The hook of a crowbar enters it grappling with
something around the edges Then with a tug and a loud

a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor

clouds of dust fly into the air Molly looks up

MOLLY
Sam look theres a whole eight
feet up there

SAM
And about eighty years of dust

MOLLY
We have all this height Sam We
could add a second floor and put our
bedroom upstairs That would leave
all this space

SAM
(eyeing her curiously)

For what

MOLLY
For space Just space

SAM

as the stretcher begins to roll right through him The
penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam

stands almost paralyzed as the body of the Orderly

strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of
Orderlys body passing through his It is like a
ultimate chaos the universe within

Then in a flash the Orderly has passed through but
still shaking He stares up at the ceiling

of conversations It all seems strangely odd and

Time seems unfixed malleable

We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave

Sam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting
the mourners The woman looks up at him smiles and

Sam is surprised He looks behind him but no one is

As he turns back the woman is walking away She
just like any normal person until she approaches a

down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass
gone There is no blood Excited and confused he turns
and sees Sam For a moment he cannot comprehend what

happening

Sam
There is a strange silent moment between them
Then seemingly out of nowhere a terrible CLICKING
heard Frightening black forms are emerging from the
Carl looks behind him and gasps Past the figures
toward him he sees his own dead body It is pinned to
window sill
Before Carl can cry out the dark figures swoop down
envelope him In a flash his spirit is caught and

with the dark forces back into the shadows Far in some
invisible distance we can barely hear him scream

And then it is silent It is over

terrible

and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze
Sam
turns to look at it His eyes are full of surprise and
wonder
The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him As
he
looks down he notices that his hands are growing
transparent
His body is beginning to fade A faint smile forms on
his
face He leans down toward Molly staring at her fora

I cant stay anymore

Tears roll down her cheek

The brilliant light intensifies It is beautiful like

We see Sams spirit rise from the room It passes
