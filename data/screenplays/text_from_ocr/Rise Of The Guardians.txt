SEQ 125 - ALONE IN THE WORLD
DARKNESS

JACK (VO)

Darkness Thats the first thing I
remember It was dark and it was
cold And I was scared

The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of
light refracted through water which turns into

A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE

The moonlight intensifies almost magically and the ice
above
begins to spider-web and crack

EXT FROZEN POND - NIGHT

Snow-covered trees in every direction The ice in the pond
continues to crack until finally a hole splinters open A
young man floats out of the water bathed in the intense
moonlight This is JACK FROST - thin pale barefoot his
tousled hair frosted white

JACK (VO)

But thenthen I saw the moon It
was so big and it was so bright
and it seemed to chase the darkness
away And when it didI wasnt
scared anymore

Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
underneath him
the

distance

JACK (VO)

Why I was there and what I was
meant to do - that Ive never
known And a part of me wonders if
I ever will

Jack looks around confused then turns toward the moonlight
as it dims a bit

Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something

with his feet He looks down and at his feet is a wooden
staff Curious he picks it up Almost immediately the

staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands Odd
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 2

Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
contact with the ground Frost shoots out and spreads across
the ice Jack is visibly confused

He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
trunks Then he swings the staff again more confident as
he begins to run across the frozen pond

Another swing and a gust of wind swirls him high up into

air Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
earth and into the trees Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the

EXT BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs
Jack comes in for a landing and its a rocky one He stands
up still elated and brushes himself off

As Jack makes his way into town settlers are warming their
hands by campfire Jack doesnt recognize anyone

JACK
(to the townsfolk)
Hello Hello Good evening
maam

(BEAT)
Maam

The settlers walk past Jack not noticing him Jack crouches
down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him

JACK
of

Oh ah excuse me can you tell me
where I am

The boy runs right through Jack as if he were a ghost Jack
staggers back in shock Hes speechless as if the wind had
been knocked out him His emotions causing it to snow

JACK
Hello Hello

Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack unaware of his
presence Shaken Jack turns and retreats into the forest

JACK (VO)

My name is Jack Frost -- how do I

know that The moon told me so

But that was all he ever told me

And that was a long long time ago
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 3

We pan up as the moon shines down over the snow covered
trees

SEQ 175 - INTRO TO NORTH
EXT NORTH POLE - DUSK
FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal

a MASSIVE ICE CANYON and just around a bend the incredible
hidden fortress of NORTH aka SANTA CLAUS

INT NORTHS WORKSHOP - DUSK

We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white
trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block

ice onto a stone work table--
IN QUICK CUTS A CHAINSAW shears the block in half spraying

ice North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo
on his arm the word NAUGHTY clearly visible

Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies
each licking their own tasty morsel

NORTH (0S)
Still waiting for cookies
sleeve

then

midair

the

concerned

As North crosses the background the elves lower the cookies
from their mouths their faces frozen in fear

The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself
across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge
HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS finally grabbing
a miniature HAMMER As Norths humming along with his music
delicately CHISELING into the ice we see a second arm

tatoo the word NICE clearly visible--

His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELERS EYEPIECE -- a
delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice--

His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK

ice LOCOMOTIVE It belches ice vapor and chugs down the
track picking up speed--

NORTH
Yes

Norths hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two

Elves
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 4

One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the
plate as it chews with a mouth full of food to which it

unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out
onto the plate

NORTH
Ah finally

He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track He chuckles
as the train hits a loop and launches off a ramp into

-- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and
train lifts off the track--
Suddenly the DOOR is thrown open by one of Norths

YETIS sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the
floor in pieces

YETI
Arghbal
NORTH
Ach

The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame North cries
out devastated The yeti equally emotional lets out
another whimper North looks down at the broken toy and
takes a moment to collect himself

NORTH
How many times have I told you to
knock

YETI

Warga blarghgha

NORTH
What The Globe

North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and
HEADS OUT--

INT NORTHS GLOBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A sea of tiny BELLS on the heads of panicking elves part as
Norths huge boots stomp through

NORTH
Shoo with your pointy heads Why
are you always under boot

He pushes his way past a couple of his YETI WORKERS --
theyre looking up in fear at -
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 5

THE GLOBE OF BELIEF

Covered with LIGHTS blanketing the continents But North
notices that all at once HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS suddenly go
out

NORTH
What is this

Now MORE LIGHTS in GREATER NUMBERS as if something is
snuffing them out by the thousands Norths concern grows

NORTH

(TO YETI)
Have you checked the axis Is
rotation balanced
as

dissipates

YETI
(SHRUGS SHOULDERS)
Wardle bawddrel

Before the Yeti can finish a WIND whips up from out of
nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING
BLACK SAND crawls over the lights and shrouds the ENTIRE
GLOBE in inky DARKNESS--

The elves scurry in a panic then all at once the BLACK SAND
WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling

the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and
into the air --

As the wind dies the scattered pieces of debris settle to
the ground and the globes lights come back on North whirls
to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving
walls of his fortress It quickly disappears leaving
nothing but the distant ECHO ofLAUGHTER

North is frozen looking up into the darkness gravely

NORTH
Can it be
(then calls off)
Dingle

A group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to
themselves as if theyre all Dingle The excitement
quickly turns to confusion

NORTH
Make preparations We are going to
have company

North reaches out for a large EMERGENCY LEVER TWISTS and
PRESSES IT--
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 6

The Globe pulses with ENERGY which lights up and ZOOMS UP
the AXIS SHAFT toward the roof--

EXT NORTH POLE - CONTINUOUS
From the tallest spire of Norths fortress NORTHERN LIGHT

ENERGY radiates outward for the first time in decades the
GUARDIANS CALL GOES OUT

TOOTH A Mini Tooth Fairy flies up to Tooth as thousands of
tiny MINI TOOTH FAIRIES continue their work behind them

TOOTH (0S)
Wait

And suddenly everything stops Tooth whips around and we
finally see her beautiful FACE
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 7

Shes holding up a little tooth and gazing at it with

adoration The surrounding fairies tweet with excitement
TOOTH (CONTD)
ts her first tooth Have you
ever seen a more adorable lateral
incisor in all of your life
(GASPS)
Look how she flossed

The fairies tweets turn to concern turning Tooths
attention to Norths AURORA SIGNAL stretching across the
sky
She gasps and flies off like a rocket toward the source of
the signal accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies

NORTH (VO)

My fellow Guardians - It is our job
to watch over the children of the
world and keep them safe - to
bring wonder hope and dreams

And so Ive called us all here for
one reason and one reason only -
the children are in danger

Much of this we hear over the following

EXTINT CHILDS BEDROOM

We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a
stream of sand swirling overhead Its a dream and its
taken
the shape of a child playing soccer

We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into
the
sky where we see DOZENS of strands of sand descending to
earth Keep following up through majestic CLOUDS

to reveal a small GLOWING GOLDEN CLOUD of Dreamsand
shimmering among the clouds trailing the golden threads

The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure
THE SANDMAN Suddenly Norths emergency signal zips by The
Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow visibly

concerned

Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud

suddenly SWIRLS around him changing form into a small

BIPLANE with Sandy in the cockpit He BARREL ROLLS the

plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular
cloudscape

and flies off into the distance

Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 8
NORTH (VO)

An enemy we have kept at bay for
centuries has finally decided to
strike back We alone can stop
him

Much of this we hear over the following

INT EGG TUNNEL

A few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground their little
legs
carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object

Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel we can barely

keep up with a DIMLY-LIT FIGURE as it races at blinding
speed leaping and zigzagging through a series of TUNNELS --

EXT A SNOWY EXPANSE IN THE NORTH POLE

A hole opens in the snow and a pair of rabbit ears pops
out

A huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow annoyed

The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND

BUNNYMUND
Ah its freezing

He shivers with cold then goes slogging through the snow
BUNNYMUND (CONTD)

I cant feel my feet I cant feel

my feet

In the distance is Norths ornately decorated and dimly lit
palace built into the side of a mountain of ice

Sandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground He
joins North Bunny and Tooth as they walk through the Globe
Room Sand glyphs appear above Sandys head communicating
that he is busy and has a lot of work to do

NORTH

(TO SANDY)

North Bunny Tooth and Sandy reach the center of the room

Bunny turns to Sandy who shrugs while forming a Dreamsand
question mark above his head

BUNNYMUND

Bunny goes back to painting one of his Easter eggs

NORTH
Look he is up to something very
bad I feel it in my belly

BUNNYMUND

North grabs Bunnys painted egg casually juggling it in his
hand as he walks off Meanwhile Sandy who is being served
eggnog by a yeti suddenly notices something high above
of

BUNNYMUND (0S)

(LAUGHS )
North I I dont have time for

The moon rises into view high up in the ceiling its rays

light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down
the walls of the globe room

NORTH (0S)

Sandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others
attention

BUNNYMUND

Pittsburg boy eight two molars

to argue

TOOTH
Sorry not all of us get to work

Sandy tries to signal with a golden arrow pointing toward
the ceiling but to no avail as the others continue their
bickering Sandy thinks Tooth has noticed for a split
second but then -

TOOTH
(to her fairies)

incisors a bicuspid and a really

TOOTH (0S)

Hey I hate to interrupt the We
work so hard once a year club but
could we concentrate on the matter--

Sandy cant take it anymore grabs an elf by his hat and

vigorously shakes its bell The other Guardians are finally

silenced and all turn to look at Sandy who points up a
sand

crescent moon forming above his head The dizzy elf staggers

away Finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight

as it concentrates on the circle between them

NORTH
Aah Man in Moon Sandy why
didnt you say something
Sandy gives him a deadpan stare Dreamsand smoke shoots out
his ears

NORTH
(to Man in Moon)
Its been a long time old friend
What is big news

Everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of
moonlight the light ebbs away leaving a dark spot --

-- which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of PITCH The
Guardians look on stunned

BUNNYMUND
It is Pitch

North pats his belly and gives Bunny a look

NORTH
(back up to the moon)
Mannywhat must we do
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 13

In answer the shadow of Pitch disappears and the circle of
moonlight intensifies and SHRINKS concentrating further
illuminating an ORNATE SYMBOL on the floor at the center of
their circle The symbol rises out of the ground revealing a
large gem at the head of a pillar

TOOTH
Ah guys you know what this means

The moons light suddenly refracts through the gem casting
light all over the chamber

NORTH
(AWED)
Hes choosing a new Guardian

BUNNYMUND
What Why
NORTH
Must be big deal Manny thinks we
need help
BUNNYMUND
(ANNOYED)

Since when do we need help
TOOTH
I wonder who its gonna be

A Dreamsand Four-Leaf clover forms above Sandys head

TOOTH (CONTD)
Maybe the Leprechaun

BUNNYMUND
Please not the groundhog please
not the groundhog

Then A BRIGHT FLASH a rush of WIND - and a FIGURE resolves
over the central pillar slight hooded bearing a familiar
hooked STAFF

NORTH
Jack Frost

The Mini-Teeth all sigh and swoon as the Guardians stand
there stunned

BUNNYMUND
Ah I take it back The
Groundhogs fine
Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 14

DISSOLVE TO

SEQ 600 - SNOWBALL FIGHT

EXT ST PETERSBURG - NIGHT

A hooded figure with a familiar looking staff rests atop a
Post Office box on the opposite end of the street The man
touches the staff to the ground sending a streak of frost
across the street

A RUSSIAN BOY approaches a water fountain turns the handle
and moves in for a sip But as he does the water freezes
magically and the boys tongue is stuck to the frozen

His friends cant help but laugh

RUSSIAN BOY
(tongue stuck to frozen

ICE)
Aahhhhh

A mail man walks across the street and a PATCH OF ICE
magically appears under his feet He scrambles and BOOM -
lands on his butt Just behind the man we see the TRAIL OF
FROST climb up the side of a building We stay on the frost
as it moves up along a rain pipe and through the windows we
see

Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 15

A boy try to feed his gold fish but a layer of ice suddenly
forms along the water surface and prevents the fish from
reaching its food We move along the side of the building

A writer in his study sits next to stacks of papers The
window suddenly swings open and a gust of wind sends the
pages flying out the window We move along the building
across clothes lines and power lines as they freeze

We continue to move up and finally discover the culprit
Jack Frost makes his way atop a cathedral spire and takes in
the view the full moon bathes the city in moonlight

JACK
(AMUSED )

Ah now that that was fun
(BEAT)

Hey wind
Jack chuckles as he calls the wind The trees begin to sway
and leaves fly into the air Jack grabs hold of the spire
smiling as the wind blows past

JACK
Take me home

Jack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and
through the clouds Night turns to day as Jack flies from
one horizon to the other

JACK
Wooocoohooo00000000

EXT BURGESS - DAY

Jack falls through the clouds smiling toward the town of
Burgess

JACK
SNOOOOOWWWW DAAAAYYYYYY

Pedestrians clench their jackets and reach for their hats as
gusts of wind snow and streaks of frost are left in Jacks
wake

EXT FROZEN POND

Jack flies in and with the wind behind him skates across an

all too familiar pond As the wind zips across the pond it

knocks a BOOK out of the hands of a little boy walking
alone

Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 16

JAMIE
Whoa whoa

Jamie goes to pick up the book and we get a glimpse of the

Jack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the
ground With his palm open Jack uses his magic to form the
perfect snowball

He then puckers his lips and blows onto it with his icy
breath The snowball turns a light shade of blue Theres
something going on here

EXT SNOWY HILL

Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead
carried by the wind to divert the ice trail

JACK

Jamies sled suddenly turns narrowly missing the oncoming
truck and barrels toward Jacks newly formed ice ramp

JAMIE
AAAAHHHHHHHH
Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the
street high into the air and toward the statue of Thaddeus
Burgess colonial settler - 1680 Jamies friends stand in
awe mouths wide open as he sails through the air

joy Jack looks on smiling

view It lights up the night sky

JACK

me what it is

(NO RESPONSE)
Because Ive tried everything and
no one ever sees me

(NO RESPONSE)
You put me here the least you can
do is tell me tell me why

A beat The Moon shines silently down Jack turns away in
frustration

Jack leaps off the roof onto a telephone pole and begins
walking across some telephone wires A stream of Dreamsand
suddenly zips by behind him then another which swoops
around in front of him Jack turns and looks up a smile now
on his lips

JACK
Right on time Sandman

The Dreamsand descends from the sky and drifts into windows
around the town Jack runs along the telephone wire until he
can reach out and intercept one of the passing streams An
adjacent stream takes the shape of a dolphin which turns
toward Jack before continuing on its way to a waiting

Then we follow one of the streams into a window

INT CUPCAKES BEDROOM - BURGESS - CONTINUOUS

Dreamsand floats into a window where CUPCAKE is in bed
hugging a stuffed unicorn in her sleep The Dreamsand swirls
over her head and morphs into a little girl riding a
unicorn The girl smiles at the lovely dream as it flies
around the room

Then the room darkens as a wispy shadowy figure with a
familiar laugh crawls out from under the bed and rises up
Its Pitch He notices Cupcakes dream

PITCH
Ohhhh I thought I heard the
clippity-clop of a unicorn What
an adorable dream

His face softens seemingly moved

and wonder Why theres only one
thing missinga touch of fear

Pitch reaches into Cupcakes dream and touches a bony

to the unicorn It turns ashen and black and disintegrates
Cupcake flinches in her sleep Pitch snickers delighted

PITCH
Hahaha That never gets old

Pitch swirls the Dreamsand around and it all turns into
corrupted Nightmare sand

PITCH
Feel your fear Come on Come on
thats right

The black sand morphs into a horrific shadowy bucking horse
a NIGHTMARE

PITCH
Yesss What a pretty little
Nightmare

Gleefully he grabs the Nightmares mane --

PITCH
Now I want you to go tell the
others the wait is over

-- and sends it out the window where it joins a posse of
other Nightmares coursing through the streets They take off
and fly into the night sky

Pitch steps out into the street from an adjacent alley
avoiding the rays of moonlight He looks up to the sky and

stares at the MOON

AN ELF MARCHING BAND strikes up marching into the room Two

The elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves
carrying a pair of ceremonial boots Jacks confusion
escalates

JACK

dust opens it and begins clearing his throat Jack
clenches his jaw as he scans the room The Mini Teeth

to the door it locks itself and he turns back North moves
in close to Jack backing him up against the door

NORTH
Who are you Jack Frost What is

North pokes Jack in the chest

JACK

NORTH
If Man in Moon chose you to be a
Guardian you must have something
very special inside

North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as
gives Jack a curious look

NORTH
Hmmmm

North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting
dolls One is carved to look like North himself

NORTH (CONTD)
Here This is how you see me no
Very big intimidating But if you
get to know me a little--
(hands the doll to Jack)
Well go on

Jack gives North a curious look then sets down his staff
He twists the doll in half and inside is another carved
North doll this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red
cheeked and cheery

JACK
You are downright jolly

NORTH
Ah but not just jolly

The dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open
all versions of North but all slightly different

Jack holds it up to examine it

JACK
You have big eyes

NORTH
Yes Big eyes Very big Because
they are full Of wonder That is

the wonder in everything

North raises his hands and the toys on the shelves suddenly
spring to life Jack-in-the-boxes pop toy trains speed
around the room soldiers march about toy planes fly
overhead An elf gets carried aloft by a balloon

A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes

way around the room A Christmas tree is ablaze with bright
lights Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car
enters the factory floor

NORTH
Eyes that see lights in the trees
and magic in the air

As it crosses the frame dozens of other toys are now flying
around the massive chamber Its a truly magical moment

Pitch leans toward the Guardians showing nothing but
contempt

PITCH (CONTD)
Well thats all about to change

A SOUND behind Pitch one of the COLUMNS of the Palace
begins
to crack and crumble as if decaying Tooth is stunned

PITCH
Oh look its happening already

JACK

Tooths eyes widen in shock

VIGNETTES OF CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD

PITCH (VO)

Children are waking up and
realizing the Tooth Fairy never
came

Lifting pillows and finding their BABY TEETH still there

Guardians Screening Script 9612 Avid 51

Didnt they tell you Jack Its
great being a Guardian -- but

theres a catch If enough kids
stop believing everything your
friends protect - wonder hopes and
dreams - it all goes away And
little by little so do they

Jacks realizes now the magnitude of Pitchs plan

PITCH
No Christmas or Faster or little
fairies that come in the night
There will be nothing But fear
and darkness and me Its your
turn not to be believed in

Bunny throws his boomerangs at Pitch who quickly ducks out
of the way as they fly around the chamber columns Pitch
then jumps onto the back of Onyx down into the depths of the
Palace The Guardians dive after him followed by Jack

Bunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at Pitch
exploding seconds before Pitch hits the ground

to finally get his memory back

(calm serious)
Its okay Its okay Dont look
down just look at me

Jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two
rudimentary ice-skates leaving him BAREFOOT on the surface
of a familiar FROZEN pond And now we see what he sees a
girl of about FOUR (with an uncanny resemblance to Jamies
sister Sophie) stands in her skates rooted to the spot A
spiders web of cracks emanates from where she stands

JACKS SISTER

it starts to separate

Jack fixes her gazeholds ittheres nothing but the two

JACK

Jacks sister pauses a moment then smiles through her fear

And just like that Jacks demeanor changes A light is
switched on inside him and the last thing that could be
happening is what is actually happening

JACK (CONTD)

And Jack shows his sister the first leap but mugs for her

He turns toward her with his arms spread out

JACK
Alright

He reaches down to pick up a familiar-looking stick lying on
the ice He extends it towards her --

JACK (CONTD)

Jacks sister looks down She is trying to gather her
courage Jack never breaking his gaze with her

JACK (CONTD)
(SOFTLY)

She hops wobbling but catching her balance

JACK
Thats it thats ittwo

Shes almost there Jacks staff just beyond her reach

JACK

She grabs hold of Jacks staff and in one massive effort he
slings her with all his might to safety But the movement
propels him into the cracked ice He looks up to see his
sister safe - smiles - and then plunges into the dark cold
water

from the memory He sees Baby Tooth

JACK

His excitement suddenly turns to realization

JACK

He looks up at the opening above The MOON peeks out from
behind the clouds

JACK

The Moon seems to shine a little BRIGHTER Baby Tooth tries
to take flight but she sputters and lands back in the palm

Jacks hand

Jack looks down at the two halves of his staff and picks
them up He tries to fit them back together but nothing
still

happens He tries again this time using every ounce of
strength left in him Baby Tooth watches her eyes widening
as a SPARK of blue light shoots off the staff

Jack continues to push until a the icy blue light spreads

and melds the two ends of the staff back together Jack
smiles

Suddenly the entire factory begins to shake knocking the
robot doll to the ground He dives after it juggles it in
the air and catches it just before it hits the ground

Suddenly streaks of BLACK SAND whoosh up into and around

factory The dark sand snakes its way up and around the
globe causing the Yetis and Elves to scatter and knocking
TOYS to the floor

The Yetis and Elves look up in horror as the black sand now
covering the globe gives rise to Pitch who stands before
them cackling

playing

hands

NORTH

(LAUGHING)
Youre all on naughty list

(TO BUNNY)
Bunny think fast

He throws a snowball which hits Bunny smack in the face

Pitch groans in pain and rises up to see the town crawling
with Dreamsand creatures snowballs flying and yetis

PITCH
(TO HIMSELF)
No

He whips around to see the kids - having the time of their
lives - and no fear in their eyes He rises up his entire
body shaking with rage and screams at them

PITCH (CONTD)
You dare have fun in my presence
I am the Boogeyman AND YOU WILL
FEAR ME

He lunges at Jamie who come running toward him Pitchs

outstretched as if hes going to grab him by the throat But
Jamie runs right through him laughing joyous

PITCH (CONTD)
Noooo

Pitch gasps realizing that he no longer has any power over
the children The devastation plays across his face

PITCH (CONTD)
(under his breathe)
No

He sees the Guardians approach standing side by side with
one another Pitch turns and flees into the forest

EXT POND - NIGHT

Pitch runs through the shadows in terror He comes crashing
through the trees of the forest and out onto the ice of the
pond He looks over his shoulder to see if the Guardians are
on his tail when BOOM He runs smack into Norths chest
Pitch slips on the ice and falls backwards He looks up to
see North smiling down at him

NORTH
Leaving the party so soon

TOOTH
You didnt even say goodbye

Tooth tosses something to Pitch which he catches He looks
down Its a quarter

PITCH

BLAM A fist punches him right in the jaw and a single
tooth goes skittering across the ice Tooth shakes out her
hand

TOOTH
And thats for my fairies

PITCH

(SCOWLS )
You cant get rid of me Not
forever There will always be
fear

NORTH
So what As long as one child
believes we will be here to fight

Hundreds of Nightmares emerge from the woods surrounding
the
pond Its terrifying but the Guardians seem unphased

NORTH

Suddenly Pitchs eyes get huge with terror as the

Nightmares

forest

move in on him He begins to back away but the Nightmares
pick up speed as they charge toward him

PITCH
Ahhh noAAAAAHHHHHH

He tries to run but its impossible to get his footing on
the ice He falters and is swept up in the stampede of
Nightmares The streaks of black whip and latch themselves
onto Pitch as the black cloud carries him through the

PITCH (CONTD)
No no nooooooo

Pitch struggles to escape but the mass of black sand pulls
him deep into the forest under the frame of the broken bed
and back down into the dark depths of the underground He
looks up at the moon as he disappears and the hole in the
earth seals itself up

cut To

SEQ 3200 - THE OATH

EXT POND - THE MOON

Pale and faint in the day but oddly close and welcoming It
cant be but -- is that the barest hint of a FACE on the
Moon Jack smiles as he looks up at it He hears Tooths
laugh and turns to find North Tooth Bunny and Sandy their
faces shining with pride

Tooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug She lifts him off
the ground as they embrace They share a moment and she soon
recoils with giddy embarrassment as Baby Tooth interjects

Jack acknowledges Baby Tooth and gently pats her on the side
of her face as North steps forward

NORTH
Are you ready now Jack
(BEAT)
To make it official

Jack looks over a stern elf is hitting a horn against his
palm A Yeti hands North the book we saw when Jack and the
Guardians first met Sandy and Bunny share a boastful look
NORTH (CONTD)
