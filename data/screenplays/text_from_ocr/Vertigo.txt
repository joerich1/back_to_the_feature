EXT SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSE SHOT

We see a close view of a roof parapet and the curved rail of
a fire escape In the bag are large skyscrapers with all
their windows fully lit in the late winter afternoon This
background is used for the CREDIT TITLES of the picture
After the last card has FADED OUT we HOLD on to the empty
parapet when suddenly a mans hand reaches and grips the

top of the rail It is followed by another hand and after a
beat we see the face of a man in his early 30s He is an
Italian type with rough features He turns quickly and looks
below him and then turning back springs up over the empty
parapet and is lost from view We STAY on the EMPTY SCENE

for a second or two as we HEAR the scraping of boots on the
iron ladder Someone else is coming up Presently two more
hands and the head of a uniformed policeman with cap and
badge starts to climb over the parapet The CAMERA PULLS

BACK so that by the time he has completed his climb he is

in full figure He dashes out of the picture drawing his

gun Immediately following him over the parapet a detective
in plain clothes climbs over This is JOHN FERGUSON known

as SCOTTIE He too pulls a gun and dashes out of the picture

EXT SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT

A vast panorama of the San Francisco skyline Nearer to us
are three tiny figures running and jumping over the roof
tops The man on the run whom we first saw climb over the
parapet is dressed in a white shirt and light tan linen
slacks and wearing sneakers The uniformed man is shooting
at him Scottie is dressed in medium grey clothes The CAMERA
SLOWLY PANS the group across the roof tops

EXT SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - MED SHOT

We now see a short gap between rooftops with a drop below
The pursued man makes the leap successfully followed by the
uniformed policeman Scottie makes the same leap but almost
trips in taking off and is thrown off balance He tries to
recover lands awkwardly on the opposite roof and falls
forward prone with a heavy impact that hurts and drives
tile breath from his body He tries to rise but raises his
head with a look of pain -- one leg is doubled up under the
other The tiles give way and he slides backwards and his
legs go over the edge of the roof then his body In his
daze he grasps at the loose tiles and as he goes over the
edge he clutches on to the gutter which gives way and he
swings off into space looking down

The body of the policeman sprawled on the ground below
People are running into the alleyway they stare at the body
look up to where Scottie is hanging We see the light on
their upturned faces And now we hear a police whistle blown
shrilly again and again Up to this moment the background
music has had an excitement to match the scene and now it
cuts off abruptly leaving on the echo of the police whistle
as the DISSOLVE begins Then in the DISSOLVE we hear the
gentle insistence of Scarlatti played by a chamber orchestra

DISSOLVE TO
INT AN APARTMENT ON RUSSIAN HILL - (LATE AFTERNOON)

It is fresh light and simple and crowded with books
phonograph records pictures The most striking feature of
the apartment is the view The rising hills of San Francisco
framed by a large picture window To one side of the window
is the owner of the apartment MAJORIE WOOD called MIDGE

at a commercial drawing table concentrating with professional
intensity on a drawing of a slim a elongated woman with few
features and fewer clothes A brassiere sits on a table at
Midges elbow and she studies it as she draws Midge Wood

is about thirty-seven attractive straight-forward well-
but-simply-dressed she wears glasses but does not whip them
an and off as they do in the movies The music comes from a
gramophone The other occupant of the room is Scottie He
sits in a big chair with his feet stretched out on an ottoman
and his head far back There is a drink on a table nearby

He rouses himself to reach for it and in doing so knocks
over his walking stick that has been propped against the
chair He reaches out to catch it and in the quickness of
trying to keep it from falling he wrenches his body around

SCOTTIE
Ow

MIDGE
(Paying little
attention)
I thought you said no more aches and
pains

SCOTTIE
Its this darned corset It binds
He retrieves the stick

MIDGE
No three-way stretch How very un-
chic

SCOTTIE

Well you know those police department
doctors no sense of style

(Sighs gratefully)
Ah tomorrow

MIDGE
Whats tomorrow

SCOTTIE
Tomorrow the corset comes off
And this thing goes out the window
(He waves the stick)
I shall be a free man I shall wiggle
my behind free and unconfined

He raises his eyebrows with a surprised and gratified smile
Midge looks over at him with a grimace

SCOTTIE
Midge do you suppose many men wear
corsets

MIDGE

More than you think

SCOTTIE
(Interested)
How do you know Personal experience

MIDGE
Please
(Then impersonally)
And what happens after tomorrow

SCOTTIE
What do you mean

MIDGE
What are you going to do Now that
youve quit the police force

SCOTTIE
(Gently)
You sound so disapproving Midge

MIDGE
No its your life But you were the
bright young lawyer who decided he
was going to be chief of police some
day

SCOTTIE
(Gently)
I had to quit Midge

MIDGE
Why

SCOTTIE
I wake up at night seeing him fall
from the roof and try to reach
out for him

MIDGE

It wasnt your fault

SCOTTIE
I know Everybody tells me

MIDGE
Johnny the doctors explained --

SCOTTIE
I know I have Acrophobia What a
disease A fear of heights And what
a moment to find out I had it

MIDGE
Well youve got it And theres no
losing it And theres no one to
blame So why quit

SCOTTIE
And sit behind a desk Chairborne

MIDGE
Its where you belong

SCOTTIE
(With a grin)
Not with my Acrophobia Midge If I
dropped a pencil on the floor and
bent down to pick it up it could be
disastrous

MIDGE
(Laughs)
Ah Johnny-oO

She considers him for a moment then goes back to her work
By now he is up and wandering about with the help of the
stick

MIDGE
(Finally as she works)
Well whatll you do

SCOTTIE
Nothing for a while You forget Im
a man of independent means Or fairly
independent

MIDGE
Mmm Why dont you go away fora
while

SCOTTIE
(Grins)
To forget Dont be so motherly
Midge Im not going to crack up

MIDGE
Have you had any dizzy spells this
week

SCOTTIE

Im having one now

She looks up sharply with quick apprehension
SCOTTIE
From that music

MIDGE
Oh

She goes and turns off the gramophone Scottie has wandered
over to the drawing table

SCOTTIE
Whats this do-hickey here

He turns the brassiere over with his stick

MIDGE
Its a brassiere You know about
those things Youre a big boy now

SCOTTIE
Ive never run across one like that

MIDGE
Its brand new Revolutionary uplift
No shoulder straps no back straps
but does everything a brassiere should
do It works on the principle of the
cantilever bridge

SCOTTIE
(Impressed)
Uh-huh

MIDGE
An aircraft engineer down the
peninsula designed it He worked it
out in his spare time

SCOTTIE
What a pleasant hobby

He wanders back to the chair and watches her work for a long
moment Then

SCOTTIE
Hows your love life Midge

MIDGE
Thats following a train of thought
SCOTTIE
Well

MIDGE
Normal

SCOTTIE
Arent you ever going to get married

He has been looking about eagerly sees a low footstool
drags it to the center of the room as he speaks

SCOTTIE

MIDGE

SCOTTIE
What do you want me to start with --

He has stepped up on the footstool and stands there proudly
looking up and down

SCOTTIE
Now I look up I look down I look

MIDGE
(Overlapping)
Stop kidding Wait a minute

She dashes to the kitchen returns quickly with a small
aluminum household ladder

SCOTTIE

He gets on the top step

MIDGE

SCOTTIE

And at this moment he makes the mistake of turning and looking
out through the picture window

FROM SCOTTIES VIEWPOINT

We see the depth down to the street below the window The
whole picture begins to weave

A we
a bu

freighters in glass cases but more important on the walls
are many framed prints and posters and maps relating to early

Cali

fornia history some from the Mexican days many from

the Gold Rush days many of San Francisco in the Seventies
and Eighties Behind the desk sits Gavin Elster a man about
Scotties age huskily built slightly balding with cool

watc

hful eyes He is beautifully tailored and gives the

sense of a man who relishes money and knows how to use it

He s

its quietly watching Scottie who stands staring out the

window at the activity of the shipyard After a long moment

SCOTTIE
Howd you get into the shipbuilding
business Gavin

ELSTER
I married into it

Scottie shoots him a small surprised smile of approval at

his

frankness then looks out the window again

SCOTTIE
Interesting business

ELSTER
No to be honest I find it dull

SCOTTIE
You dont have to do it for a living

ELSTER
No But one assumes obligations My
wifes family is all gone someone
has to look after her interest Her
fathers partner runs the company
yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so
I decided as long as I had to work
at it Id come back here Ive always
liked it here

SCOTTIE
How long have you been back

ELSTER
Almost a year

SCOTTIE
Scottie smiles at the old prints on the wall

Though

And you like it

ELSTER

disappearing fast

SCOTTIE
Like all this

ELSTER
(Nodding)
Id like to have lived here then
The color and excitement the
power the freedom

he does not stress the word the way be lingers softly
word Freedom makes Scottie look over at him again

looks up and smiles companionably

ELSTER
Shouldnt you be sitting down

SCOTTIE
No Im all right

ELSTER
I was sorry to read about that thing
in the papers
(No answer)
And youve quit the force
(Scottie nods)
A permanent physical disability

SCOTTIE

No Acrophobia isnt a crippling
thing It just means I cant climb
steep stairs or go to high places
like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark
But --

(Shrugs and smiles)
-- there are plenty of street-level
bars In this town

then looks
ELSTER
Would you like a drink now

SCOTTIE
No no thanks A bit early in the
day for spirits

(Pause)
Well I guess that about covers
everything doesnt it I never
married I dont see much of the
old college gang Im a retired
detective -- and youre in the
shipbuilding business

(Pause)
Whats on your mind Gavin

A moment then Elster rises from the desk casually wanders
across the room looks out the window gets out a handkerchief
and blows his nose prosaically finally turns and regards
Scottie coolly and directly for a long moment

ELSTER
I asked you to come up here Scottie
knowing that you had quit detective
works but I wondered whether you
would go back on the job -- as a
special favor to me

Scottie looks at him questioningly

ELSTER
I want you to follow my wife

Scottie does not change expression and yet one can sense
the feeling of anti-climax within him and the almost
imperceptible small cynical smile deep behind his eyes

ELSTER
Not what you think Were very happily
married
SCOTTIE
Then
ELSTER
Im afraid some harm may come to
her
SCOTTIE

From whom

ELSTER
Someone dead

Scottie waits

ELSTER
Scottie do you believe that someone
out of the past someone dead can
enter and take possession of a living
being

SCOTTIE

ELSTER
If I told you I believe that his
happened to my wife what would you
say

SCOTTIE
Id say youd better take her to the
nearest psychiatrist psychologist
neurologist psychoanalyst or plain
family doctor And have him check
you both

ELSTER
(Defeated)
Then youre of no use to me Im
sorry I wasted your time Thank you
for coming in Scottie

Scottie rises to go awkwardly puzzled a bit apologetic

SCOTTIE
I didnt mean to be that rough

ELSTER
No it sounds idiotic I know And
youre still the hard-headed Scot
arent you Always were Do you think
Im making it up

SCOTTIE

ELSTER
Im not making it up I wouldnt

know how Shell be talking to me
about something nothing at all and
suddenly the words fade into silence
and a cloud comes into her eyes and
they go blank and she is somewhere
else away from me someone I dont
know I call to her and she doesnt
hear And then with a long sigh she
is back and looks at me brightly
and doesnt know shes been away
cant tell me where or why

SCOTTIE
How often does this happen

ELSTER
More and more in the past few weeks
And she wanders God knows where she
wanders I followed her one day

SCOTTIE
Whered she go

Elster almost ignores the question as he looks back to the
day

ELSTER

Watched her come out of the apartment
someone I didnt know walking in
a different way holding her head
in a way I didnt know and get into
her car and drive out to

(He smiles grimly)
Golden Gate Park Five miles She
sat on a bench at the edge of the
lake and stared across the water to
the old pillars that stand an the
far shore the Portals of the Past
Sat there a long time not moving
and I had to leave to got to the
office That evening when I came
h
d

ome I asked what shed done all

ay She said shed driven to Golden
Gate Park and sat by the lake Thats
all

SCOTTIE
Well
ELSTER

The speedometer of her car showed
she had driven 94 miles that day
Where did she go

(Pause)
I have to know Scottie Where she
goes and what she does before I got
involved with doctors

SCOTTIE
Have you talked to the doctors at
all

ELSTER

Yes but carefully Id want to know
more before committing her to that
kind of care

(Anxiously)
Scottie --

SCOTTIE
(Quickly)
I can get you a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you Theyre
dependable good boys --

ELSTER
(Breaking in)
I want you

SCOTTIE
Its not my line

ELSTER
Scottie I need a friend Someone I
can trust Im in a panic about this

Long pause

SCOTTIE
How can I see her to know her

ELSTER
Were going to an opening at the
opera tonight Well dine at Ernies
first Which is easier

SCOTTIE
Ernies

ELSTER

All right

(Pause)
You wont know what to look for at
first Scottie Even I who know her
so well cannot tell sometimes
when the change has begun She looks
so lovely and normal

The last part of this speech carries through the dissolve
DISSOLVE TO
INT ERNIES RESTAURANT - (NIGHT)

We are in the upstairs room that in mood and decor takes
us back to Bonanza Days This is the way San Francisco was
Scottie is at the bar turned a little so that he faces into
the dining room and as he drinks his eyes search the room
slowly carefully

The CAMERA SEARCHES with him passing over the many well-
dressed women until it comes to rest on a table for two
dressed against the far wall Gavin Elster is seated there
dining with his wife Scottie cannot get a clear look at
her She is turned slightly away from him and when she does
turn her head in his direction there always seems to be a
waiter passing to block the view And during all of this we
hear Elsters voice continuing from the previous scene

ELSTERS VOICE
But I realize now that the deep change
began on the first day I brought her
to San Francisco You know what San
Francisco does to people who have
never seen it before All of it
happened to Madeleine but with such
an intensity as to be almost
frightening She was like a child
came home Everything about the city
excited her she had to walk all the
hills explore the edge of the ocean
see all the old houses and wander
the old streets and when she came
upon something unchanged something
that was as it had been her delight
was so strong so fiercely possessive

These things were hers And yet she
had never been here before She had
been born and raised in the East I
liked it at first of course I love
this place I wanted my bride to
love it But then it began to make
me uneasy Her delight was too
strong her excitement was too
intense it never faded her laugh
was too loud her eyes sparkled too
brightly there was something feverish
about the way she embraced the city
She possessed it And then one day
she changed again anda great
sigh settled on her and the cloud
came into her eyes

Now Gavin Elster has signed the check and he and his wife
rise and start for the door Scottie still cannot get an
unobstructed view of her face but we can see in flashes

that she is young in her twenties with a mobile attractive
face and gentle eyes that have warmth and intelligence and
humor Scottie is intent on her At the doorway to the bar
only two feet from him she stops and waits as her husband
pauses behind her to speak to the headwaiter and thank him
and tip him She looks about calmly with sure distant

repose Her eyes come to rest an Scottie for a moment then

move an with the small smile
Elsters voice has gone on wit

During all of the above
hout pauses and his narration

ends as the girl Madeleine comes to a stop near Scottie
and waits

ELSTERS VOICE
I dont know what happened that day
where she went what she saw what

she did But on that day the search

was ended She had found what she

was looking for she had come home

And something in the city possessed

her
As Scottie stares at her their eyes meet for a moment and
he turns to reach for his drink When he turns back she is

gone He looks about slightly startled then catches a
glimpse of her as she turns the corner of the upstairs lobby
His eyes grow thoughtful and glow with the memory of her
face

a small reception desk with a key rack to one side but the
strongest and most immediate impact is one of greenery of
foliage Scattered about the lobby in profusion are tall-
standing potted rubber plants and philodendron Scottie
stands and stares There is no one to be seen no sign of
life Then we see a leaf of a rubber plant move and move
again a hand appears seemingly caressing it and then we
hear a womans voice

MANAGERESS
Yes

Scottie looks in that direction and the woman moves out
from behind the plant She is a small gentle elderly lady
with white hair motherly and smiling with bright eager
eyes

MANAGERESS
Is there something I can do for you

SCOTTIE
Yes you run this hotel

MANAGERESS
Oh yes

information of that sort Our clients
are entitled to their privacy you
know And I do believe its against
the law Of course I dont think
any of them would mind really but
still I would have to know who you

By now Scottie has got out his wallet and has shown his badge
and the sight of it makes her stop abruptly and for a moment
her face hardens and is not a bit motherly But then she
recovers her innocent brightness

Oh dear Has she done something

indicate the bun at the back of the neck Scottie nods

has several pieces of jewelry that
belonged to Carlotta She inherited
them Never wore them they were too
old-fashioned until now Now
when she is alone she gets them out
and looks at them handles them gently

curiously puts them on and stares
at herself in the mirror and goes
into that other world is someone

else again

Carlotta Valdes was what your wifes
grandmother

ELSTER
Great-grandmother The child who was
taken from her whose loss drove
Carlotta mad and to her death - was
Madeleines grandmother

SCOTTIE

Well that explains it Anyone could
develop an obsession for the past
with a background like that

narrowly)

She never heard of Carlotta Valdes

Knows nothing of a grave out at

apartment There is a picture window that looks up to Coit
Tower on Telegraph Hill The room is softly lit A fire is

lit in the fireplace the logs are blazing well Scottie in
a pair of grey trousers and an old sweater is wandering
about the room trying to think things out Through an open
door we can see into a small kitchen where Madeleines clothes -
all of them - hang on a cord over the electric stove drying
And through another open door we can see into the bedroom
where Madeleine lies in the larger-than-single bed under
the covers asleep She sighs and turns restlessly and
Scottie glances at her from the living-room as he wanders

and then she turns again and the sigh becomes words spoken
in sleep and he stops and listens

MADELEINE
(Faintly distantly)
Please thank you please

Scottie waits taut but there is no more He starts to turn
away and suddenly still distant but more clearly

MADELEINE
(Appealingly)
Where is my child have you seen

my child

Scottie stiffens with the shock of recognition and his eyes
go wide with apprehension staring at the lost eye-closed
troubled woman in the bed And at that moment the telephone
on the bedside table rings sharply He makes a dash for it
The ringing brings the woman to with a sharp start and she
instinctively clutches the bedclothes to her chin and raises
up a little and stares with wide-eyed fright at the man
running towards her Scottie takes the phone

SCOTTIE
Yes No its all right Ill
call you back Yes Yes

He hangs up and tries to smile down at Madeleine who has
not moved but has followed his every move with fright and
apprehension

SCOTTIE
Are you all right

No answer only the eyes staring at him And then he realizes
with some embarrassment that she cannot move that she is
naked under the bedclothes and he reaches across to the
dressing gown he has laid out for her on the bed and moves

it closer to her

SCOTTIE
Oh youll want this

He gives her a reassuring nod and smile straightens up and
goes to the door and goes into the living room closing the
bedroom door behind him And she stares after him as he goes
In the living room he moves to the fireplace puts another
log on and watches it catch The bedroom door behind him
opens and he turns to face Madeleine She has the dressing
gown belted tightly around the middle and holds it together
with one band at her breast And she stands there staring at
him nervously frightened not wanting to admit that she
does not know how she came there but wanting very much to
know And she cannot help herself knowing her own fears
she has to ask

MADELEINE
Why am I here What happened

SCOTTIE
You
(Then not liking the
sound of the truth)
fell into the Bay

She puts a hand slowly to her hair understanding now why it
is wet

SCOTTIE
I dried your hair as well as I could
But youd better come here by the
fire

And now knowing that he dried her hair she realizes that
he must have taken her clothes off too and she looks down
at her body with deep awareness of her nakedness and draws
the dressing gown more closely to her and looks back at him
with frightened embarrassment And her head begins to move
quickly the eyes darting about the apartment as though
seeking a way of escape and she sees the clothes hanging in
the kitchen And she looks back to Scottie appealingly

SCOTTIE
Theyre almost at dry Here Why
dont you come over here
He pulls a low-stool over before the fire Madeleine crosses
slowly keeping her eyes always on him and sinks down on
the stool He smiles a at her companionably

SCOTTIE
Would you like some coffee

She shakes her head
SCOTTIE
Youd better have some Or would you

rather have a drink

She shakes her head again He pours a cup of coffee and places
it on the floor next to her along with a bowl of sugar cubes

MADELEINE
(Wonderingly)
fell into the bay

She looks up at him He nods

MADELEINE
and you fished me out

He nods She gives him a small grateful smile

MADELEINE
Thank you

Scottie is watching her intently

SCOTTIE
You dont remember

MADELEINE

SCOTTIE
Do you remember where you were
MADELEINE
(Childishly surprised)
Oh of course I remember that But
then I must have had a dizzy spell
and fainted

SCOTTIE
(Quickly)
Where were you

MADELEINE
At

For that one slight imperceptible moments it may seem that
she is caught but then she goes on

MADELEINE
(Triumphantly)
»-Old Port Point Out at the
Presidio Of course I remember I
often go there

SCOTTIE
Why

MADELEINE

(Almost naively)
Because I love it so Its beautiful
there Especially at sunset
(She leans her head
back sensually to
the warmth)
Ah thank you for the fire

SCOTTIE
Where had you been before

MADELEINE
When

SCOTTIE
This afternoon

MADELEINE
Oh wandering about

SCOTTIE
Before Where Where had you been
There is a quick moment of blankness in her eyes that she
tries to hide and then

MADELEINE
(Positively)
Downtown shopping

And Scottie sighs inwardly having proved something

SCOTTIE
Please drink your coffee

MADELEINE
I will Youre terribly direct in
your questions

SCOTTIE
Im sorry I didnt mean to be rude

MADELEINE
Youre not Merely direct What were
you doing there At Old Fort Point

SCOTTIE
Wandering about

MADELEINE
You like it too

He nods She smiles at him happily enjoying the warmth and
the coffee enjoying his presence seemingly almost to have
forgotten her nearness to death And Scottie is fascinated
by this thing curled up before his fire

MADELEINE
(Then with a wicked
smile)
And where had you been just
before

A moment as Scottie takes a deep breath and then he decides
to chance it and see the reaction

SCOTTIE
The Palace of the Legion of honor
The Art Gallery

MADELEINE
(Enthusiastically)
Oh thats a lovely spot isnt it
Ive never been inside But it looks
so lovely driving past

At the words Ive never been inside Scottie is startled
He stares at her and she looks at him with naive happy
inquisitiveness and their looks are joined Finally she
drops her eyes and smiles timidly

MADELEINE

(Softly)
Lucky for me you were wandering about
Thank you again Ive been terrible

bother to you

SCOTTIE
No

She reaches up to feel her hair

MADELEINE
When you
(And suddenly conscious
of her nakedness
again and embarrassed)
There were pins in my hair

SCOTTIE
Oh Yes Here

picks up an ash tray in which

He crosses the room swiftly
takes her handbag from a chair

he had deposited her hairpins
and brings them to her

MADELEINE
Thank you

She proceeds to do up her hair He watches her held by the
movement of her body under the dressing gown as she raises

her arms and deftly sets about putting her hair in order At
one point as she works she looks up and flashes him a direct

smile
MADELEINE
You shouldnt have brought me here
you know
SCOTTIE

I didnt know where you lived
MADELEINE
You could have looked in my car Oh
but you didnt know my car did you

SCOTTIE
Yes I knew which one it was Its
out there now But I didnt think
youd want to be brought home that
way

MADELEINE

No you are right

(Pause as she works)
Im glad you didnt take me home
I wouldnt have known you to thank
you

(Suddenly appalled)
Oh but I dont know you And you
dont know me My name is Madeleine
Elster

SCOTTIE
My name is John Ferguson

MADELEINE
Thats a good strong name Do your
friends call you John Or Jack

SCOTTIE
John Old friends Acquaintances

MADELEINE
(Smiling)
I shall call you Mr Ferguson

SCOTTIE
(Grinning)
No I wouldnt like that And after
what happened today I should think
you could call me Scottie Or even
John

MADELEINE
I prefer John There thats done
(The hair is in order)
And what do you do John
SCOTTIE

Wander about

MADELEINE
Thats a good occupation And live

here alone

He nods A cloud comes over her eyes

MADELEINE
(softly)
One shouldnt live alone
SCOTTIE
Some people prefer it
MADELEINE
No its wrong

Then she looks up with a
from her eyes

small smile

MADELEINE

(Simply)

Im married you know

Scottie nods almost imperceptibly with his eyes

her for a long moment Then

SCOTTIE
Will you tell me something Has this
ever happened to you before

MADELEINE
(startled)
What
SCOTTIE
Falling into San Francisco
Bay

She laughs with relief for it seemed to her

She looks away

and the cloud is gone

and she speaks completely matter-of-factly

He looks at

for a quick

moment that he was going to say falling in love

MADELE

INE

No never before Ive fallen into

lakes out of rowboats

when I was a

little girl And I fell into a river
once trying to leap from one stone
to another But Ive never fallen
into San Francisco Bay Have you
Ever before

SCOTTIE
(Grinning)
No this is the first time for me
too

And they laugh together with genuine warmth and friendliness
in their eyes and it is obvious they are very much taken
with each other And as they laugh simultaneously she
reaches for the cup of coffee to take another sip and he
reaches for it meaning to take it and refill it

SCOTTIE
Here let me give you a lit --

And his hand falls on her outstretched arm and stays there
and with the contact made the laughter dies suddenly and
he is looking down at her intently and their eyes have met
and hers are anxious and wondering And at that moment the
telephone rings sharply Scottie races into the bedroom
closing the door behind him and gets to the phone

SCOTTIE
Hello

ELSTERS VOICE
Scottie what happened Shes not

SCOTTIE
No shes all right Shes still

There is a long silence

SCOTTIE

SCOTTIE
No Shes in fine shape Nothing to

You understand that She doesnt
know what she did

Another long silence

when she was twenty-six

And now it is Scotties turn to be silent He hangs up slowly
and moves across the room to the door

INT THE LIVING ROOM - (NIGHT)

Scottie enters from the bedroom and stops surprised The
room is empty The clothes are gone from the in the kitchen

From Midges point of view Madeleine outside Scotties

INT MIDGES CAR - (NIGHT)

Midge watches Madeleine almost wistfully and there is a
small look of hurt in her eyes But even to herself she has
to cover and she smiles ironically

EXT SCOTTIES APARTMENT - (NIGHT)

The Jaguar pulls away and passes out of view
INT MIDGES CAR - (NIGHT)

Midge is still staring across at Scotties house and the
soft smile on her lips covers the hurt well But there is
still a shadow of it in her eyes

MIDGE
(Softly)
Well now Johnny-O Was ita
ghost And was it fun

Then she suddenly changes expression

MIDGE
Oops

She takes her foot off the brake and turning hard on the
wheel straightens the car up and drives on

EXT SCOTTIES APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
The door to Scotties apartment has opened and Scottie stands
in the doorway looking up and down the street for the Jaguar

which she is going

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

The Jaguar turns right into a narrow curving street and
finally comes to a sudden stop ahead

INT SCOTTIES CAR - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Scottie now wears a look of great astonishment as he pulls
up hurriedly in the middle of the street

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From his viewpoints we see the reason for his astonishment
Madeleine has alighted and is approaching of all places
toward his own red front door

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Scottie pulls his car over to the curb and gets out The
CAMERA PANS him down He stops short just before he reaches
Madeleine to see her take a letter from her handbag and put
it into his letter box He moves up to her

SCOTTIE
Is that for me

Madeleine turns quickly startled and then sees who it is
and smiles
MADELEINE
Oh Yes Hello

SCOTTIE
Good morning I worried about you
last night You shouldnt have run

like that
MADELEINE
(Embarrassed)
I suddenly felt such a fool
SCOTTIE
I wanted to drive you home Are you
all right
MADELEINE

(Flashing a smile)
Oh yes Fine No after effects
(Then ruefully)
But as I remember now that water
was cold wasnt it
(He nods She looks
away)
What a terrible thing to do and
you were so kind
(With a gesture)
Its a formal thank-you letter And
a great big apology

SCOTTIE
Youve nothing to apologize for

MADELEINE
Oh yes The whole thing must have
been so embarrassing for you

SCOTTIE
Not at all I enjoyed --

And he stops short now truly embarrassed and she looks at
him with wide eyes waiting for him to go on

SCOTTIE
-- talking to you

MADELEINE
(With small contained
amusement)
I enjoyed talking to you

An awkward pause Scottie turns abruptly to the door getting
out his key

SCOTTIE
Ill get my mail

He opens the door and bends down to pick up the letter As
he is reaching for it he turns his head and speaks almost
without thinking

SCOTTIE
Would you like some coffee

MADELEINE
(Quickly)
No No thank you

She says it so impulsively and with such young vehemence
that they both start to laugh He straightens up and opens
the letter

MADELEINE
I couldnt mail it I didnt know
your address But I had a landmark
I remembered Coit Tower and it led
me straight to you

SCOTTIE
The first time Ive been grateful
for Coit Tower

He reads the letter as she watches him He looks up

SCOTTIE
I hope we will too

MADELEINE
What

SCOTTIE
Meet again sometime

MADELEINE
We have

They smile at one another and there is a nice moment of
silent rapport Then

MADELEINE
Good-bye

SCOTTIE
Good-bye

She turns and goes to her car as he stands watching her and
gets in behind the wheel

SCOTTIE
(Suddenly walking)
Where are you going

And he races to the car and leans in the window She watches
him open-mouthed as he crosses the sidewalk Then

MADELEINE
I dont know
SCOTTIE
Shopping
MADELEINE
No
SCOTTIE
Well anywhere in particular
MADELEINE
No I Just thought Id wander
SCOTTIE

Ah
(Then)
Thats what I was going to do

MADELEINE
Oh yes I forgot Its your
occupation isnt it
And she waits with a small smile
SCOTTIE
Dont you think its sort of a waste

for the two of us to

MADELEINE
Wander separately Ah but only one
is a wanderer Two together are
always going somewhere

SCOTTIE
No no I dont think thats
necessarily true

And now he waits hopefully

He turns his head
for the door As he goes

And he hurries on to the door

the laughter fades a little

happy smile on her lips Scottie is at her side
relaxed He keeps looking at her as often as he can without
seeming obvious

SCOTTIE
(Finally)
Do you know where youre going

Of course not Im a wanderer
(Pause Then brightly)
Id like to go somewhere Ive never

SCOTTIE
How can you be sure

MADELEINE

She flashes a quick smile of innocence at him then returns
her eyes to the road He looks at her profile wondering

the figures of Madeleine and Scottie wandering among the
towering trees

Madeleine and Scottie near the massive trunk of a tree

Beyond them the small stream bridged by a wide flattened
redwood log

MADELEINE
How old

SCOTTIE
Oh some two thousand years or
more

MADELEINE

The oldest living things

Scottie nods and watches her wondering as she looks about
thoughtfully

SCOTTIE
Youve never been here before
She shakes her head lost in thought as she lets her gaze
wander among the trees

SCOTTIE
What are you thinking

MADELEINE
(Searching)
Of all the people who have been
born and have died while the

trees went on living

SCOTTIE
(Agreeing)
Their true name is Sequoia
Sempervirens always green ever-
living

MADELEINE
(Flatly)
I dont like them

SCOTTIE
Why

MADELEINE
(Simply)
Knowing I have to die

She looks up at him with a shy embarrassed smile Then
seeing the wandering look in his eyes she brightens quickly

MADELEINE
But I like the stream Its a lovely
stream

She leaves him and moves quickly out onto the bridge and
loans on the railing to watch the water rippling below And
then as he approaches her she turns and looks at him wide-
eyed

MADELEINE
But it makes no sound Listen

She listens intensely for a long moment and looks at him
anxiously

MADELEINE
Do you hear anything
SCOTTIE
(Shaking his head)
Only silence Its always like this

MADELEINE
(Wondering)
And no birds sing

SCOTTIE
No birds live here

MADELEINE
No

She turns away with gentle somber self-contained wonder
and they cross back to the path in silence and wander on
along the path in silence We watch them move away in the
distance disappear behind a tree then come into view again
and now there comes into view the cross-section of a redwood
tree that is on exhibit with certain of its rings marked to
show what it has lived through and they approach it

SCOTTIE
Would you like a drink of water

MADELEINE
No thank you

Scottie moves to the small upright drinking fountain as
Madeleine approaches the tree section and stands before it
and studies it Scottie gets a drink of water then comes up
behind Madeleine and stands and she is seemingly unaware of
his presence Their backs are to the CAMERA INSERT OF RINGS
on the tree marked with dates beginning near the center
with the date 909 AD and ending with 1930 - tree cut down

EXT RED WOODS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

We see the two profiles Madeleine staring at the tree
Scottie staring at Madeleine She raises one gloved hand and
almost idly begins to trace a finger up along the white line
that is marked 1776 DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE And as the
hand moves a little to the left Madeleine begins to speak
almost vacantly oblivious of all but this piece of tree
and herself

MADELEINE
Somewhere in here I was born and
here I died and it was only a moment

for you you took no notice
SCOTTIE
(Almost sharply)
Madeleine

She turns her head to him only now aware of his presence
and stares at him without expression Then slowly she turns
and walks away and the CAMERA PANNING HER SLIGHTLY brings
the head and shoulders of Scottie into the foreground and
he watches her wondering anxiously trying to put things
together in his mind Madeleine walks on until she disappears
behind one of the distant redwoods

EXT RED WOODS - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Scottie moves over watching her

MOVES far enough to reveal that Madeleine is no longer there

view of where Madeleine went

she is breathing heavily In the background we see Scottie
approaching her As he comes up to her the CAMERA EASES
BACK and MOVES AROUND until it faces her and Scottie

SCOTTIE
(Gently)
Madeleine

She opens her eyes slowly and looks at him recognizing
him and yet not quite as though she were slightly
hypnotized Scottie speaks gently

SCOTTIE
Where are you now

MADELEINE
(Softly distantly)
Here with you

SCOTTIE
Where

MADELEINE

SCOTTIE
Have you been here before

MADELEINE
Yes

When
She shakes her head
SCOTTIE

Where were you born

MADELEINE
Long ago

SCOTTIE
Where

She shakes her head
SCOTTIE
When

Her head continues to move back and forth gently denying
His voice is more positive now more urgently demanding

SCOTTIE
Tell me

The head moves more rapidly now as though denying some
inner compulsion

SCOTTIE
Madeleine Tell me

The rapidly moving head stops short and her eyes open wide
and she cries out

MADELEINE
No No

SCOTTIE
(Low and urgent)
Tell me what it is Where do you go
What takes you away

MADELEINE
No dont ask me

They are both speaking quickly now the words cascading
without pause

SCOTTIE
When you jumped in the bay you didnt
know where you were You guessed but
you didnt know

MADELEINE
I didnt jump I fell You told me I
fell

SCOTTIE

Why did you jump

MADELEINE
No

SCOTTIE
What was it inside that told you to
jump

She is fighting it strongly yet pathetically

MADELEINE
No I cant tell you

SCOTTIE
What

MADELEINE
(Strongly)
No Please Please please please
please dont ask me

And her head drops and she sags and Scottie stands quietly
watching her knowing he can push it no further

MADELEINE
(Softly tired)
Take me away from here

SCOTTIE
Home

MADELEINE
somewhere in the light

He takes her arm She looks up at him with a tired smile

MADELEINE
And promise you wont ask me again
Please promise me that

He looks down at her somberly promising and refusing nothing
They start walking holding together and the two figures
become small in the distance moving away through the tall
trees

Below the point of land the sea pounds against the rocks
Madeleine stands alone silhouetted against the sky Scottie
sits in the car watching her She does not move Then slowly
she starts to walk toward the sea and as he watches he
senses without being sure that her pace is increasing and
suddenly he opens the car door and jumps out and slams the
door and begins to run But then he sees something and slows
down quickly and walks for Madeleine has stopped and turned
and is waiting for him There is a gentle apologetic smile
in her eyes She waits and he comes to a stop before her

MADELEINE
Why did you run

He looks down at her searchingly

SCOTTIE
(Finally quietly)
Im responsible for you now you
know The Chinese say that once you
have saved someones life you are
responsible for it forever And so
Im committed And I have to know

MADELEINE
And youll go on saving me Again
and again

He waits She looks down

MADELEINE

There is so little I know It is as
though I were walking down a long
corridor that once was mirrored and
fragments of mirror still hang there
dark and shadowy reflecting a dark
image of me and yet not me
someone else in other clothes of
another time doing things I have
never done but still me And I
cant stop to ask why I must keep
on walking At the and of the corridor
there is nothing but darkness and I
know when I walk into the darkness
Ill die

(Pause she looks up)
But Ive never come to the and Ive
always come back before then Except
once

SCOTTIE
Yesterday

She nods
SCOTTIE
And you didnt know You didnt know
what happened Until you found
yourself there with me

She shakes her head

SCOTTIE
You dont know where you were

She shakes her head
SCOTTIE
But the small scenes the fragments

in the mirror you remember them

MADELEINE
Vaguely

SCOTTIE
What do you remember

MADELEINE
(Searching)
A room there is a room and I sit
there alone always alone
SCOTTIE
Would you know the room
MADELEINE
No its in shadow

SCOTTIE
Theres a name on the gravestone

MADELEINE

No Its new and clean and waiting

SCOTTIE
(Beginning to feel
lost)
What else
MADELEINE
(Searching)
This part is dream I think There
is a tower and a bell and a garden
below but it seems to be in
Spain a village in Spain And
then it clicks off and is gone

SCOTTIE
A portrait Do you ever see a
portrait

MADELEINE
No

SCOTTIE
Of the woman in the mirror Would
you know her if you saw her

MADELEINE
But Im the woman in the mirror

SCOTTIE
(Desperately)
No

She looks up at him
eyes well with tears
thought

rebuffed desperately lost and her
Scottie is looking away lost in

(To himself)

If I could find the key

find the
beginning put it together

MADELEINE
(Quietly lost)
And so explain it away But there
is a way to explain it you see If
Im mad That would explain it
wouldnt it

Scottie looks at her and her eyes are big with fright and
despair and a plea for denial and suddenly she breaks and
the tears flow and she turns her head away sharply and turns
and runs toward the edge of the land

SCOTTIE
Madeleine

He races after her and catches her and holds her and she is
against him clinging tightly deep in his embrace and
sobbing fiercely

MADELEINE

(Muffled against his

breast)
Im not mad Im not mad And I dont
want to die but theres someone
inside me theres a somebody else
and she says I must die Scottie
dont let me go

SCOTTIE
Im here Ive got you

MADELEINE
Im so afraid
(She looks up)
-you wont let it happen

Her face is close to his and they are clinging tightly
together He shakes his head and then suddenly his mouth is
on hers and they are deep in a kiss Their lips part but
remain close together

MADELEINE
(Whispering)
Dont leave me stay with me

SCOTTIE
All the time
They kiss again passionately And the wind blows and the
waves dash against the rocks throwing up a curtain of spray

INT MIDGES APARTMENT - (NIGHT)

Outside the terrace darkness is falling and the lights of
the city have come on In Midges apartment the lights are

on and soft music comes from the radio (possibly progressive
jazz of the gentle George Shearing kind) Midge is painting
at a standing easel She has a palette obviously she is
painting in oils We cannot see what she is painting the
canvas on stretchers has its back to us Its size is about
thirty by forty inches Whatever it is it seems to please
her she pauses in her work picks up a highball from a table
nearby drinks and stares at the painting and giggles a little
to herself than applies a few more daubs Now she hears the
outside gate slam She puts down the brush and the drink
moves the easel a bit so that the canvas cannot be seen from
the front door picks up a water tumbler that contains a
small nosegay and hurries out to the kitchen with it The
door to the apartment slams

SCOTTIE
(Calling)
Midge

Midge hurries out of the kitchen

MIDGE
Hi Johnny Did you get my message

She immediately goes to the small sideboard or table on which
are bottles glasses and ice and mixes him a highball
Scottie is at ease He drops his hat on a chair near the

door and wanders into the room

SCOTTIE
I did Since when do you go about
slipping notes under mens doors

MIDGE
Since I stopped being able to get
them on the phone For a man who has
nothing to do youre certainly a
busy little bee Where do you go
these days
SCOTTIE
Just wander

MIDGE
Where

SCOTTIE
Around

MIDGE
Oh

She hands him the drink He takes a long pull at it as she
watches him

SCOTTIE
Mm Better

MIDGE
Did you need it

SCOTTIE
Yeah

MIDGE
Oh

She crosses the room to get her own drink giving a flick of
a glance at the canvas as she goes Scottie watches her
slightly amused knowing that her curiosity is working like
mad

SCOTTIE
What was this desperate urge to see
me

MIDGE

All I said in the note was Where
are you That doesnt sound desperate
to me

SCOTTIE
Well I detected an undercurrent

MIDGE
I just thought if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner youd be so
grateful youd take me to a movie
Pause

SCOTTIE
Fair enough Whatll we talk about
at dinner

MIDGE
Oh this and that

SCOTTIE

If you want to Naturally we wont
talk about anything you dont want
to talk about

SCOTTIE
Naturally
MIDGE
(Innocently)

What have you been doing

SCOTTIE
(With small grin)
Wandering

He takes another long pull and wanders over and sweetens the

drink
and canvas

Midge moves a little to block his view of the easel

SCOTTIE
What have you been doing

He wanders back into the room

MIDGE
Oh Im having a wonderful time
Ive gone back to my first love
painting

SCOTTIE
Good Ive always said you were
wasting your time in the underwear
department

MIDGE
Well its a living But Im excited
about this

Scottie moves toward the easel and Midge backs away so that
as he comes around to face the canvas she in beyond him in
back of him As he moves toward the easel

MIDGE
As a matter of fact I thought I
might give it to you

SCOTTIE
(smiling surprised)
Oh

And now he comes around to face the easel and stops to look
Beyond him Midges face has a great smile of anticipation
And now we see what he sees The CAMERA RESTS on the lower
half of the canvas and we see the folds of the blue and gold
gown and the two hands one holding the nosegay The CAMERA
PANS UP to reveal that it is a hasty but quite creditable
copy of the Portrait of Carlotta half size but there is
one difference The face is Midges face

with anticipation Scotties face is drained and
expressionless and a deep look of sadness and regret comes
into his eyes

Pause

SCOTTIE
(Softly)
Not funny Midge

Midges smile fades She is puzzled and surprised Scottie
puts down his drink gently and without looking at her starts
for the door

MIDGE
Johnny
Scottie takes his hat from the chair and moves on to the
door Midge completely taken aback starts for him

MIDGE
But Johnny I thought you would --

She breaks off as he turns his head to look at her Hes not
at all angry but disturbed inside and sorry it happened

SCOTTIE
(Nicely)
Well make that movie some other
night huh

And he goes out the door and closes it behind him
MIDGE
(Desperately apologetic)
But Johnny

And she stares at the door with a Well-Ill-be-damned
expression And now abruptly she gets angry at herself

MIDGE
Ah no

She turns away and moves toward the canvas

MIDGE
Oh Marjorie Wood You fool

She stops before the canvas and stares at her face in the
portrait And all her anger at herself comes out in one great
blast of scorn
MIDGE
(At the portrait)

And she picks up a brush and with three vicious daubs paints
a moustache and a beard on her image Then she throws the
brush out the window

DISSOLVE TO
EXT UNION SQUARE - (NIGHT)

It is about 3 am The Square is deserted -- perhaps an odd
taxi or car drives by We see Scottie a solitary figure

walking By his attitude head down hands thrust into his
pockets we see that he is lost in thought wrestling with

his problem

DISSOLVE TO
INT SCOTTIES APARTMENT - (EARLY DAWN)

Scottie is in the easy chair facing the fire asleep His tie
is loosened his shirt is open at the neck It is clear that
he fell asleep while sitting there thinking of Madeleine
and slept through the night The fire is almost out Through
the window we can barely distinguish Coit Tower in the
beginning of a grey dawn The doorbell begins to ring
instantly There is a knocking on the door Scottie awakens
sharply gathers himself together hurries to the door and
opens it Madeleine stands there looking shaken and white
and frightened She is wearing a black suede jacket and black
slacks Behind her fingers of mist swirl in the lightening
day She stands there staring at him pleadingly

SCOTTIE
Whats the matter What time is
it Madeleine whats happened

He draws her in and closes the door and leads her into the
room

MADELEINE
(Barely)
I should have phoned but I wanted
to see you be with you
SCOTTIE

Why Whats happened
MADELEINE
I had the dream The dream came back
again
She is trembling and he holds her closely
SCOTTIE
Its all right Youre all right
Ill get you some brandy

He breaks away to a small cupboard nearby
MADELEINE
(Sharply)
No dont go away

SCOTTIE
Only this far

He gets out a bottle of brandy and a small glass and uncorks
the bottle and pours the brandy as he comes back to her

SCOTTIE
Here Straight down its medicine

She takes a sip and puts the glass away

SCOTTIE
Wheres your husband

MADELEINE
I didnt wake him I dont want him
to know

She is still shaking

SCOTTIE
Here now its going to be all right
Here

He gently pushes her down in the easy chair turns swiftly
and kicks up the fire and throws some wood on He pulls the
low stool up before her sits on it and takes her hands

SCOTTIE
It was a dream youre awake youre
all right now Can you tell me

MADELEINE
It was the tower again and the
bell and the old Spanish village

SCOTTIE
Yes --
MADELEINE
But clear so very clear for
the first time all of it
SCOTTIE

Tell me
MADELEINE
There was a village square a green
with trees and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister
Across the green a big grey wooden
house with a porch and shutters and
a balcony above a small garden
and next to it a livery stable
with old carriages lined up inside

Scottie has been listening intently with growing awareness
and now as she mentions the livery stable his eyes glow
with the excitement of recognition

SCOTTIE
Go on

MADELEINE
At the end of the green there was a
whitewashed stone house with a lovely
pepper tree at the corner --

SCOTTIE
(Finishing it)
-- and an old wooden hotel of the
old California days and a saloon
dark low-ceilinged with hanging
oil lamps

MADELEINE
Yes But --
SCOTTIE
(Gently)

Its all there Its no dream

Pause as she stares at him puzzled anxious

SCOTTIE
Youve been there before Youve
seen it

MADELEINE
No never

SCOTTIE

Madeleine a hundred miles south of
San Francisco theres an old Spanish
Mission Mission San Juan Bautista
Its been preserved exactly as it
was a hundred years ago as a museum
Now think hard darling Youve
been there before Youve seen it

MADELEINE
(Frightened)
No never Ive never been there
Scottie what is it Ive never been
there

Long pause as they stare at each other he desperately trying
to think it through shes moved and frightened He rises and
moves away anxious and shaken

SCOTTIE
(To himself)
Carlotta

He shakes his head angrily fighting the idea Madeleine
watches him anxiously

SCOTTIE
What was it he said She came from
somewhere south of the city some

say a mission settlement
He turns on Madeleine almost desperately

SCOTTIE
Madeleine think hard

She shakes her head frantically hopelessly close to tears
Pause

SCOTTIE
(Quietly)
Go on with your dream What was it
that frightened you

MADELEINE
I stood alone on the green searching
for something and I started to walk
to the church But then the darkness
closed in I was alone in the dark
being pulled into darkness and I
fought to wake up
She looks at him frightened again by the memory He goes to
her reassuringly

SCOTTIE
Youre going to be all right now
Madeleine Ive got something to
work on now Im going to take you
there -- to the Mission -- this
afternoon And when you see it youll
remember when you saw it before and
that will finish your dream and
destroy it I promise Youll be
free

She looks up at him and tries to smile

SCOTTIE
All right

She nods
SCOTTIE
Ill take you home If your husband
is awake say you couldnt sleep and
went out for some air And come back
to me about noon Come along

He raises her to her feet She smiles up at him gratefully

MADELEINE
No Ill go alone Im all right

They stand there for a moment looking at each other

(Firmly)
Not merely as it was a hundred years
ago As it was a year ago or six
months ago whenever you were here

(Pressing)
Madeleine think of when you were
here

She looks down at him with a worried regretful smile
wishing she could help him Then she looks away into the
distance and speaks almost at irrelevantly

MADELEINE

(Dreamily)
There were not so many carriages
then And there were horses in the
stalls a bay two black and a grey
It was her favorite place but we
were forbidden to play here and
Sister Teresa would scold us

Scottie looks up at her in desperation then looks about the

stable for help His look scans the carriages and wagons

lined against the wall goes past the old fire truck on which
there is a placard proclaiming the worlds championship of
1884 and finally stops at a small buggy -- a Bike Wagon --
To which is hitched a full-sized model of a handsome grey

horse

He races to the horse On it hangs a sign Greyhound Worlds

SCOTTIE
Heres your grey horse Course hed

He looks across to Madeleine eagerly She is staring ahead
lost in the past

SCOTTIE

No answer The music is more insistent now a pulling wind
and the faint voices call more clearly Madeleine slowly
rises to her feet as though sensing the call Scottie moves
back to her and stands there looking up He raises his arms
she puts her bands on his shoulders and slips to the ground
with his help and he is holding her Their heads are close
together

With a small movement their lips come together and they
kiss not impulsively as before but with deep sure love

tower seems to slide away from him He makes an attempt to
start up the stairs flattens himself against the wall and
struggles up He claws his way up crosses over to the hand-
handrailing and uses it to pull his body up the steps one
by one railing struggling for breath unable to call though
he tries And Madeleine keeps running Madeleine reaches

are gathered talking Some people glance up to the second
floor where the windows are open and from which a droning
voice can faintly be heard The CAMERA ZOOMS UP to the open
window and as it does the voice of the speaker becomes
louder and the words more intelligible

INT PLAZA HALL ROOM SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (DAY)

The Coroners Inquest is in session The Jury of twelve local
people is at one side Among the people assembled we see
the two nuns escorted by a priest Gavin Elster with

his attorney some State Patrolmen and of course Scottie
Next to him is a burly man in his fifties in civilian clothes
almost obviously a detective and obviously Scotties one
friend there He is Detective Captain Fred Hansen of the San
Francisco Police

At the front of the room is the Official who is speaking a
rather testy old man Behind him on the wall are an old

crudely hand-made American Flag from the last century anda
California Bear Flag

(NOTE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE FOLLOWING SPEECH COVERS

THE RISE AND ENTRANCE OF THE CAMERA AND BECOMES INTELLIGIBLE
ONLY AT ITS END)

OFFICIAL

Mr Elster suspecting that all was
not well with his wifes mental state
took the preliminary precaution of
having her watched by Mr Ferguson
lest any harm befall her and you
have heard that Mr Elster was
prepared to take his wife to an
institution where her mental health
would have been in the hand of
qualified specialists And Mr
Ferguson being an ex-detective
would have seemed the proper choice
for the role of watchdog and
protector As you have learned it
was an unfortunate choice
(pause)
However I think you will agree that
no blame can be attached to the
husband His delay in putting his
wife under medical care was due only
to the need information as to her
behavior that he expected to get
from Mr Ferguson He had taken every
precaution to protect his wife He
could not have anticipated that Mr
Fergusons weakness his fear of
heights called acrophobia would
make him powerless when he was most
needed

(pause)
As to Mr Ferguson you have heard

his former superior Detective Captain
Hansen from that great city to the
north testify as to his character

and ability Captain Hansen was most
enthusiastic The fact that Mr
Ferguson once before under similar
circumstances allowed a police
colleague to tall to his death
Captain Hansen dismissed as an
unfortunate Incident

Captain Hansens eyes narrow and his face reddens Scottie
stares at the floor dully oblivious to what is being said

OFFICIAL

Of course Mr Ferguson is to be
congratulated for having once saved
the womans life when in a previous
fit of aberration she threw herself
into the Bay It is a pity that
knowing her suicidal tendencies he
did not make a greater effort the
second time But we are not here to
pass judgment on Mr Fergusons lack
of initiative He did nothing and
the law has little to say on the
subject of things left undone

(pause)
Nor does his strange behavior after
he saw the body fall have any bearing
on your verdict He did not remain
at the scone of the death He ran
away He claims he suffered a mental
blackout and knew nothing more until
he found himself back in his own
apartment in San Francisco several
hours later You may accept that or
not Or you may believe that having
once again allowed someone to die
he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness and ran away
That has nothing to do with your
verdict It is a matter between him
and his conscience

(pause)
Now From the evidence of the mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her
death from the manner of her death
and from the Postmortem examination

of the body showing the actual cause
of her death you should have no
difficulty in reaching your verdict
Gentlemen you may retire

The Foreman of the jury leans across to his colleagues and
they go into a huddle After a short whispered consultation
there is a general nodding of heads then the Foreman stands

FOREMAN
Weve reached the verdict

OFFICIAL
And what is your verdict

FOREMAN
We find that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide while being out of --
while being out of unsound mind

OFFICIAL
Your verdict will be so recorded
Dismissed

People start to rise There is a general exodus toward the
doorway and the stairs leading down to the ground floor
Scottie remains impassive still staring at the floor People
stare at him curiously as they move past him and away
Detective Hansen rises takes him by the arm and helps him

to his feet

HANSEN
Lets go Scottie
(Glares over at the
Official grimly)
The son of a --

He purses his lips and starts Scottie toward the door Gavin
Elster moves toward them and they meet and have to stop
Hansen looks at Elster impassively

ELSTER
Do you mind if I speak to him for a

minute

Receiving no answers he takes Scottie by the elbow

ELSTER
Scottie --
He leads Scottie away toward the window They stop

ELSTER
Scottie Im sorry That was rough

Scottie finally looks up at him

ELSTER
He had no right to say that It was
my responsibility You didnt know
her I shouldnt have got you

involved
SCOTTIE
(struggling)

I -- I --
ELSTER

No theres nothing you have to say
to me Im getting out Scottie For
good I cant stay here Im winding
up her affairs and mine Im going
to get as far away as I can Probably
Europe And Ill probably never come
back

(Extends his hand)
Good-bye Scottie If theres anything
I can do for you before I go

Scottie looks at the outstretched hand then looks up at the
mans face wanting very much to tell him how he felt about
the dead woman But the words wont come Elster drops his
hand with a sympathetic half-smile and touches Scottie
comfortingly on the arm

ELSTER
There was no way for them to
understand But you and I know who
killed Madeleine

Elster and Scottie look at each other for a moment Then
Elster nods somberly and turns away and goes down the stairs
with his attorney The room is empty now but for Hansen
and Scottie Hansen waiting near the doorway looks across
to Scottie standing alone by the window Beyond Scottie
through the window we can see the cloister across the green

INT SCOTTIES BEDROOM - (NIGHT)

Scottie in bed sleeping restlessly His head fills the
screen rolls from side to side In a SLOW DISSOLVE while
his head remains on the screen there comes into focus and
is superimposed as it gets closer the head and shoulders of
the portrait of Carlotta The CAMERA PANS DOWN until it
reveals the nosegay The portrait is cleared from the screen
a new image is superimposed the final scene at the inquest
between Scottie and Gavin Elster But this time though it

is not distinct a womans head can be discerned on Elsters
shoulder Elster turns to the woman and says Tell him hes
not to blame tell him The woman turns her head to smile
at Scottie It is Carlotta Valdes again dressed as in the
portrait with the necklace at her throats and she is alive
The picture fades away Scotties restless head is alone on
the screen again

Another scene dissolves to the screen the graveyard at
Mission Dolores The CAMERA IS APPROACHING the grave of
Carlotta Valdes Now we see Scottie approaching the grave
Now the CAMERA REVERSES MOVING closer to the grave It is
open there is a great black abyss with the headstone to
mark it

A CLOSEUP OF SCOTTIE coming to a stop as he stares down The
black depths of the grave fill the screen and now suddenly
we start to fall A BIG CLOSEUP OF SCOTTIE his hair
windswept staring down in horror as he falls REVERSE ANGLE
he is still falling but now from the tower of the Mission
at San Juan onto the roof where Madeleine fell and at the
moment of impact the picture clears and Scottie is sitting
up in bed staring ahead in horror awakened by the sound of
his own scream The scream is echoed by a fog horn in the
distance

DISSOLVE TO
INT SANITARIUM BEDROOM - (DAY)

We see a portable phonograph with a record on and we hear
Mozart at his gayest most incisive most sparkling And

then we find Midge standing nearby smiling across at Scottie

who is seated in a wheelchair wearing a dressing gown over
pajamas His face is gaunt and expressionless We are ina
light and pleasant bed-sitting room Through the window we
can see a lovely garden and a few patients accompanied by
nurses strolling along the paths

MIDGE

(Brightly)
Its Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus I had
a long talk with the lady in musical
therapy and she said Mozarts the
boy for you Johnny The broom that
sweeps the cobwebs away Thats what
the lady said You know its
wonderful how theyve got it all
taped now John Theyve got music
for melancholiacs and music for
dipsomaniacs and music for

nymphomaniacs I wonder what would
happen if somebody mixed up their
files

There is no reaction on Scotties face and Midge makes a
grimace of dissatisfaction at the weakness of her joke She
looks across at him uncertainly

MIDGE
But I brought you a lot of other
things You can see what you like
And the thing shuts off automatically

She crosses to him swiftly kneels beside him

MIDGE
Ah Johnny please try Johnny try
Youre not lost Mothers here

No reaction Long pause Then we hear the door open

Scottie does not seem to hear but Midge turns her head A
nurse is looking in with a significant look at Midge

MIDGE
Time Okay

The nurse goes out Midge rises

MIDGE
Ill be in again John Do you want
me to shut that off It shuts off
automatically

Her eyes crinkle with anxiety She nods and goes to the
phonograph and shuts it off She comes back to him slowly
and stands behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders

MIDGE
(Softly)
Ah Johnny-O you dont know Im
here do you

She leans down and kisses him lightly on the top of the head
and smiles gently

MIDGE
But Im here

She moves to the door going out of the SHOT and we hear
the door open and close Scottie has not moved his face

does not change expression His head bends down and his

gaze is fixed on the floor

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SCOTTIES ROOM - (DAY)

Midge walking down the corridor meets the nurse near the
open door of an office

MIDGE
Could I see the doctor for a moment

The nurse backs up a step and looks in the open doorway

NURSE
Doctor
The Doctor looks up and sees Midge in the doorway

DOCTOR
Oh Yes Miss Wood

The nurse continues on up the corridor Midge remains in the
doorway

MIDGE
Doctor how long is it going to take
you to pull him out of this

DOCTOR

It is hard to say Six months at
least Perhaps a year It depends to
a certain extent on him

MIDGE
He wont talk

DOCTOR

No We have ways of digging out
knowledge But it takes longer He
is suffering from acute melancholia
together with a guilt complex He
blames himself for what happened to
the woman And we know little of the
background

MIDGE
I can give you one thing he was in
love with her

DOCTOR
Ah That complicates the problem

MIDGE
Ill give you another complication
he still is

The Doctor studies her carefully

MIDGE
And you know something Doctor I
dont think Mozarts going to help
at all
She attempts a bright gay smile but it comes out wrong She
turns and walks away down the corridor

Scottie is seated at the bar exactly as he was the first

glance wanders about the room as he drinks but he does not
seem to be so much searching as waiting And then he stiffens
From somewhere across the room a man and a woman are making
their way among the tables toward the exit and their relative
positions as they move recall exactly the way Madeleine and
Gavin Elster moved toward him on that night And as the woman
moves toward him difficult to see clearly because of the
movements of the waiters crossing her path he could swear
that it is Madeleine and so could we Although she does

not wear an evening dress Scottie stares fearing and hoping
as the woman gets closer and closer And then she is there
and pauses near him to wait for the man exactly as Madeleine
did -- but it is not Madeleine

DISSOLVE TO
EXT BROCKLEBANK APARTMENTS - (DAY)

Scottie in the foreground and across the street the apartment
building from which Madeleine used to emerge with the
forecourt of cars A long moment then a man emerges and
crosses the street and walks toward the Fairmont Hotel
Another wait and then a woman comes out of the apartment
house She has Madeleines figure and Madeleines style
Scottie freezes The woman crosses the forecourt toward a

car out of our sight Scottie moves to follow the course of
the woman and we move with him and now the car comes into
sight it is the green Jaguar The woman opens the car door
Scottie races across the street and into the forecourt By
the time he gets to the Jaguar the woman is in behind the
wheel and has the motor started Scottie races up to her

then stops short The woman is not like Madeleine in features
and is a good deal older She looks up startled as Scottie
comes to a stop by the open car window

SCOTTIE
Where did you get this car

THE WOMAN
(Startled by his
vehemence)

I beg your pardon

SCOTTIE
This car
THE WOMAN
Oh Why I bought it from a man

who used to live here in this
apartment building Mister Gavin
Elster I bought it from him when he
moved away

As Scottie stares at her she grasps the connection

THE WOMAN
Oh You know him And his wife The
poor thing I didnt know her Tell
me -- is it true that she really
believed --

But by this time Scottie has turned and walked away and she
stares after him a bit taken aback

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PALACE OF THE LEGION OF HONOR - (DAY)

Framed in the columns of the forecourt Scottie wanders up
the front walk and passes through the doors into the Art
Gallery

INT PALACE OF THE LEGION OF HONOR - (DAY)

Scottie wanders to the entrance of the room in which hangs

he Portrait of Carlotta and stops and looks towards the

ar corner Some people pass before him but then as the

ista clears he sees walking toward him from Carlottas corner
woman who must surely be Madeleine He stares rigid as

he comes closer and then she passes out of view as she

eads for the exit Scottie turns to keep her in sight and

s she passes through the doors to go out to the courtyard

he turns a just a bit so that she is silhouetted slightly

n profile against the cuter light and once again surely it
s Madeleine Scottie heads for the door fast pushes through
he courtyard

teehee aweyTaw ds met

He breaks into a run and catches up with her and puts out
his hand to take her arm and as he does she turns startled
by his sudden appearance at her side -- and they both stop
and stare at each other It is not Madeleine A moment as
the woman stares at him frightened

SCOTTIE
Im sorry

He turns away The woman walks on
DISSOLVE TO
EXT PODESTA BALDOCCHI - (LATE AFTERNOON)

Scottie stands before the window looking at the floral
display In the foreground is a group of madeup nosegays and
one of them is exactly like the nosegay Madeleine carried to
the grave to the portrait to the moment she threw herself
into the Bay A porter closes the shop door and locks it A
moment then Scottie turns away to move down Grant Avenue
He stops short Coming up Grant Avenue headed for Sutter
Street is a group of shopgirls who have just come out of
work and among them is one who -- again -- must surely be
Madeleine Scottie watches them come closer trying to get a
clear view through the crowd of passersby catching sight of
the girl only in glimpses and as the girls come abreast of

him they stop to make their farewells The one nearest to
Scottie seen in profile might have the same features as
Madeleine He cannot be sure This girls hair is dark where
Madeleines was light her features on closer inspection

seem heavier and she wears much more makeup And yet there
is something about the way she carries herself The other
girls cross the street while the one nearest to Scottie goes
on alone He instinctively turns and follows

DISSOLVE TO
EXT SUTTER STREET NEAR LEAVENWORTH - (LATE AFTERNOON)

A trolley coach passes heading west The girl starts to

cross the street in the middle of the block waits for another
trolley coach to pass continues to the opposite side and
goes into the Empire Hotel one of the typical inexpensive
residential hotels of that neighborhood Scottie remains on
the opposite side of the street watching wondering what to
do next

He waits and then in much the same way it happened to him
long ago at the McKittrick Hotel his attention is attracted
to a window on the second floor The girl appears and opens
the window about eight inches then pulls down the blind
Scottie stares at the window calculates in his mind the
geographical position of the room then starts across the
street

DISSOLVE TO

Scottie moves down the hall counting doors and comes to a
stop He knocks The door opens and the girl stands and
looks at him and waits Scottie stares at her searching
for a sign of recognition but there is none

JUDY
Well What is it

Her voice is flat and slightly nasal in sharp contrast to
Madeleines low husky voice Scottie winces slightly at the

sound of it He keeps staring at her for a moment Then

SCOTTIE
Could I ask you a couple of questions

JUDY
What for Who are you

SCOTTIE

it open against her

SCOTTIE

She hesitates impressed by the urgency in his voice

SCOTTIE
Just let me talk to you

JUDY
(Hesitating)
What about
SCOTTIE

JUDY
Why

She is still holding on to the door ready to slam it

SCOTTIE
Because you remind me of someone

She laughs a short ironic skeptical laugh

JUDY

Ive heard that one before too I
remind you of someone you used to be
madly in love with but she ditched
you for another guy and youve been
carrying the torch ever since and
then you saw me and something clicked

(scornfully)
Huh

SCOTTIE
(With a rueful smile)
Youre not far wrong

JUDY
Well its not going to work So

SCOTTIE

Her mouth drops open with shock at his effrontery
SCOTTIE
You can leave the door open Please

A moment then she backs into the room a little and he
follows

JUDY
I warn you I can yell awfully loud

SCOTTIE

A long moment as he stands before her sagging a little
defeated She becomes remorseful and sympathetic

JUDY
(Gently)
Gee you have got it bad havent

He stares at her with an intensity that makes her crinkle
her eyes in embarrassment

JUDY
Shes dead isnt she

An almost imperceptible nod

JUDY
Im sorry And Im sorry I yelled at

He turns away slowly toward the door His eyes fall on some
framed photographs on the dresser and he pauses then moves
closer to see them clearly One is of a girl about sixteen
standing with a woman in her late thirties they have their
arms about each other they both have dark hair Scottie
stares at it then glances at Judy

JUDY

Scotties eyes move to another photograph of a man in his
early forties standing before a store Above the store a
sign says A M BARTON HARDWARES

She pauses and looks up and thinks and wonders and tries
to see into the future and as she does the fear in her
eyes dissolve into anxious hope and then resolve

She puts the pen down rises slowly takes up the letter and
tears it into small pieces and drops the pieces into the
wastebasket She turns to the closet pushes the suitcase
back in with the toe of her foot pushes the grey suit far
back into darkness and closes the closet door She walks to
the dresser and stares at herself in the mirror She opens

a candy box in which we see trinkets and pieces of junk
jewelry and takes out two plain hoop earrings She puts
them on and looks to see how much change they make She takes
up an eyebrow pencil and slightly exaggerates the arch of
her brows She stares at herself impassively for a long time

is a sound of chatter and a slight clatter of dishes at a
side table We are looking from the bar and at a table
against the far wall we see Judy and Scottie dining They
are talking amiable Scottie is being genial and
companionable but there is no particular sense of intimacy
Judy looks about quite a bit obviously admiring the room
and the food and the clothes of the people about her She is
dressed neatly but more simply and more cheaply than are
the other women in the room and she is conscious of it and
keeps fiddling with the shoulders at her dress

During this a party of diners enters is greeted by the
captain and is led across the room toward an empty table
near Judy and Scottie We go with them winding among the
tables As we get very close to Scottie he looks up and
becomes rigid and stares A woman has just gone by him to
take seat at the neighboring table Her hair is blonde and
is done exactly as was Madeleines from the rear she could
easily be Madeleine But then she turns and sits down
glancing at Scottie as she does and we see that it is not
Madeleine A moment then Scottie looks away Judy is staring
at him anxiously It is her first defeat and her first
victory defeat in that although he is with her he is still
searching victory in that she is sure now that he does
not think she is Madeleine

Judy turns the corner moving towards him

AS SCOTTIE WATCHES CRITICALLY

Judy comes up to him He backs into the room Judy following
INT HOTEL BEDROOM - (DAY)

As Judy comes into the room Scottie closes the door without
taking his eyes from her She looks at him gravely -- and
holds out her hand as though hoping for praise for the
transformation Her eyebrows have been plucked her makeup
lightened her lipstick changed and she now bears much more
of a resemblance to Madeleine

JUDY
Well

SCOTTIE
It should be back from your face --
with a bun at the neck I told them
I told you

JUDY
We tried it It didnt suit me

Scottie abruptly goes to her takes her hanging hair with
both hands pulls it to the back so that her ears show Judy
looks at him half-angry half-scared

Scottie seeing the look in her eyes takes his hands away
The hair falls forward again

SCOTTIE
Im sorry

They look at one another for a moment Then Scottie asks
almost humbly

SCOTTIE
Judy -- please --

Judy doesnt answer for a moment then she draws a deep
breath and turns resignedly away She crosses to the mirror
over a chest of drawers Scottie matches as she picks up a
couple of pins from a glass tray and scoops up a handful of
hair Scottie stands watching in silence His eyes follow
every move We hear the tinkle of pins of the glass tray

FROM SCOTTIES VIEWPOINT

Judy slowly turns from the mirror to face him She looks
exactly like Madeleine -- her hair pulled back and done in a
bun at the back of the neck She stands there looking at
him SCOTTIE looks at her in wonder his eyes shining

JUDY takes a step towards him rewarded by his expression
SCOTTIE moves over and takes Judy in his arms

BIG HEADS

of the two of them together The CAMERA MOVES AROUND the

big heads Scottie holds her tighter and tighter He looks
past her shoulder and we see that his eyes are closed because
at last he holds Madeleine in his arms once more He opens
his eyes -- the CAMERA SWIMS AROUND the room

WE ARE NOW IN THE LIVERY STABLE AT SAN JUAN BAUTISTA

with Scottie holding Madeleine tight in his arms kissing
her We see this for only the briefest moment before it

DISSOLVES AWAY TO
BACK IN THE HOTEL ROOM

Scottie kisses her as he did in the livery stables As he
kisses her and she turns his kiss the CAMERA PULLS BACK
SLOWLY and their two figures are held in the center of the
room

DISSOLVE TO
INT JUDYS BEDROOM - (EARLY EVENING)

The window shades are drawn the lights in the room have

been lit Scottie is sitting relaxed thumbing through a
magazine idly The jacket of his suit is hung over the back
of a chair The bathroom door is open There is a full length
mirror on the back of the bathroom door and we catch
occasional glimpses of Judy as she moves about inside
Scottie looks up as she calls to him Her voice is light and

happy
JUDY
Where shall we go for dinner

SCOTTIE
Wherever youd like

JUDY
Ernies
SCOTTIE
Youve got a thing about Ernies

havent you

JUDY
Well after all its our place

She comes out of the bathroom happy and contented She wears
the black cocktail dress her blonde hair is done up in the

Madeleine way She stops to pose and show off the dress and
smiles across at him lovingly

JUDY
Hello my love Like me

He regards her admiringly with a small contented grin

SCOTTIE

JUDY
Is that the best you can do

She turns to the mirror over the dresser

SCOTTIE
Come here

JUDY
Oh no Youll muss me

SCOTTIE
Thats what I had in mind

JUDY
Too late Ive got my face on

She has opened the candy box rummages around in the jewelry
comes up with some earrings holds one up to her ear to see
what it looks like decides against it finds some other
earrings small and neat and puts them on During this

JUDY
Im suddenly hungry Would you rather
go somewhere else

SCOTTIE
No Ernies is fine

JUDY
Im going to have one of those big
beautiful steaks And lets see

to start

During this she has taken a necklace out of the box and is
trying to fasten it around her neck But the clasp wont

work

JUDY
Oh Help me with this will you

She backs up a step still holding the necklace in place
and Scottie rises from his chair and comes up in back of
her He takes the ends of the necklace from her

SCOTTIE
Ive got it He bends down and bites
the back of her neck

JUDY
Oh Youre supposed to fasten it

SCOTTIE
All in good time

He bites her again

JUDY
Scottie

SCOTTIE
How does it work

JUDY
Cant you see

SCOTTIE
Oh yeah There
As he is fastening it he glances into the mirror and sees
the necklace clearly for the first time His eyes are
immediately startled with the shock of recognition and he
stares wondering why The CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a closeup of
the necklace in the mirror then with a click the closeup
changes to a closeup of the necklace painted on canvas The
CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show the necklace around the neck of
Carlotta in the portrait the same necklace Now the CAMERA
DRAWS BACK to show the Art Gallery with the Portrait of
Carlotta on the far wall The scene click-changes to a BIG
HEAD of SCOTTIE staring and during this we hear Judy
chattering away

JUDYS VOICE

Thank you darling Now Im just
about ready I just have to find my
lipstick Where did I put it I had
it a minute ago

(Her voice fading)
Did I leave it in here Oh yes
here it is

(Her voice fading in)
All right Im ready

His eyes move in the direction of the voice and now we see
her standing a few feet from him smiling at him She walks
to him with a loving smile

JUDY
But first muss me a little

She puts her arms around him and presses against him and
lays her head against his chest with a happy sigh

JUDY
Ah Scottie I do have you now

He raises his arms as though to embrace her moves his hands
to her shoulders and one senses for a moment that he is
going to press her too hard or that he may move his hands to
her throat But then he lays his hands gently on her back
and closes his eyes wearily and rests his head on the top
of hers

SCOTTIE
(Softly)
How would you like to go somewhere
out of town for dinner Drive down
the peninsula somewhere

She moves her head and he raises his and opens his eyes
and she smiles up at him

JUDY
All right if youd like

She reaches up and kisses him briefly on the mouth He smiles
a small enigmatic smile

Scotties car enters the avenue of tall trees we saw once
before along this road They look sinister in the moonlight

Scotties car traveling fast looking up and ahead to the

distant end of the tunnel and the tall trees flashing by

INT SCOTTIES CAR - (MOONLIGHT)

Scottie is staring straight ahead concentrating on his
driving Judy is staring up at the tall trees wondering
her brow furrowed Her memory is stirred but she cant think
why

He looks ahead thoughtfully

EXT MISSION SAN BAUTISTA - (NIGHT) - LONG HIGH SHOT

see Scotties car crawl into the square and pass along the
road around the green and come to a stop near the entrance

to the church A distant church clock chimes the half-hour

INT SCOTTIES CAR - (MOONLIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT
Judys face rigid frightened her eyes filled with
apprehension Then with an effort she composes herself and
glances at Scottie with calm questioning But he is turned
away from her opening his door to get out

EXT SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (NIGHT)
Scottie comes around the car and opens Judys door

JUDY
Scottie why are we here

SCOTTIE
I told you I have to go back into

But why Why here

SCOTTIE

Pause
He holds out his hand She shrinks frightened
JUDY

No I dont want to go I want to
stay here

SCOTTIE

SCOTTIE

I cant do it alone I need you to
be Madeleine for a while Then when
its done well both be free

He draws her out of the car

JUDY
Im scared

SCOTTIE
So am I But it has to be done I
have to tell you about Madeleine
now

He closes the car door and leads her slightly away and they
stop and look across the green toward the Livery Stable

SCOTTIE
There

He points to the Livery Stable bathed in moonlight

SCOTTIE
We stood there and I kissed her
for the last time And she said If

you --
JUDY
(Pleading)
Scottie --
SCOTTIE

(Going right on)
-- and wanted to go on loving you
And I said I wont lose you
(pause)
But I did

He turns slowly and Judy with him and he looks up Her
eyes follow his

FROM THEIR ANGLE
The high church tower in the moonlight
SCOTTIES VOICE
She turned and ran into the
Church

SCOTTIE AND JUDY

He puts his arm around her protectively but firmly and begins
to impel her gently to the church

EXT CHURCH SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (MOONLIGHT)
SHOOTING from the door Scottie impels Judy to the door

SCOTTIE
-And when I followed her it was
too late

The CAMERA PULLS AROUND as his tree hand goes to try the
door

JUDY

(Frightened)
I dont want to go in there

Scottie pushes the door open

SCOTTIE
»too late

He pushes her into the church with gentle firmness
INT CHURCH SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (NIGHT)

The darkness is relieved by shafts of moonlight Scottie
impels Judy toward the foot of the tower

SCOTTIE
I couldnt find her Then I heard
her footsteps on the stairs she was
running up the tower

INT CHURCH TOWER - (NIGHT)

It is lit by shafts of moonlight through the slit window
Scottie comes into the area holding Judy He looks up

FROM SCOTTIES ANGLE
the open stairway spiraling upward

SCOTTIES VOICE
She ran up those stairs and through
the door at the top of the tower
and locked it behind her Then she
jumped

BACK TO SCOTTIE AND JUDY

He is still staring up Judy is rigid with fright and the
memory of that moment

SCOTTIE
And I couldnt follow her
(He closes his eyes

in the agony of

remembering)
God knows I tried

(He glances down)
One doesnt often get a second chance
I want to stop being haunted Youre
my second chances Judy

JUDY
(A frightened whisper)
Take me away

SCOTTIE
You look like Madeleine now Go up
the stairs

JUDY
No

SCOTTIE
Go up the stairs Judy
(Pushing her to the
step)
Ill follow

She starts up slowly unwillingly Scottie follows behind
her fighting to keep the impending vertigo under control
trying to keep his eyes fixed on her back to avoid looking

up into space They move up in silence and in shadow their
faces occasionally lit by the shafts of moonlight that stream
through the open arches of the tower Judys eyes are wide
and staring her face and body are stiff with the struggle

to keep from breaking under the strain of remembering the
last time she went up these stairs And Scottie fights his
way up behind her

Judy slows down and comes to a halt at the landing that
Scottie barely reached the last time at the moment of death
She leans her back against the wall for support Scottie
struggles up and comes to a halt near her

PAUSE as he gathers himself for the last assault

SCOTTIE
(Quietly)
This was as far as I could get But
you went on Remember
She stiffens and stares at him

SCOTTIE
The necklace Madeleine That was
the slip I remembered the necklace

A moment then suddenly she ducks and tries to run past him
down the stairs He grabs her wrist and holds on

SCOTTIE
Were going up the tower Madeleine

JUDY
No Let me go

SCOTTIE
Were going up the tower

JUDY
You cant Youre afraid

SCOTTIE
Im going to Its my second chance

He starts to drag her up the stairs and she fights it close
to hysteria

JUDY
Scottie please

SCOTTIE
But you knew that day that I
wouldnt be able to follow you didnt
you Who was at the top when you got
there Elster With his wife

JUDY
Yes

SCOTTIE
And she was the one who died Not
you The real wife You were the
copy you were the counterfeit Was
she dead or alive when you got there

JUDY
Dead Hed broken her neck

SCOTTIE
Took no chances did he And when

you got there he pushed her off the
tower was that it But you were the
one who screamed Why did you scream

JUDY
I wanted to stop it I ran up to
stop it --

SCOTTIE

Why Since youd tricked me so well
up to then You played his wife so
well Judy He made you over didnt
he Just as Ive done But better
Not just the hair and the clothes
the look the manner the words
Those beautiful phony trances That
jump into the Bay Ill bet youre
really a strong swimmer arent you
Arent you

The blind frantic nodding of her head as she struggles
against him is his affirmation

SCOTTIE
Did he train you Rehearse you
Teach you what to say and what to
do

JUDY
Yes

SCOTTIE
And you were such an apt pupil What
fun you two must have had playing
games with me Why me Why did he
pick on me

JUDY
Your accident

SCOTTIE
Ah yes I was a set-up I was the
made-to-order witness Where is he
now

JUDY
I dont know Switzerland
SCOTTIE
Well find him

They have reached the door to the tower and he stops with a
grim almost triumphant smile

SCOTTIE
I made it
JUDY
(Apprehensive)

What are you going to do

SCOTTIE
Look at the scene of the crime Go
on in

He pushes the door open She shrinks back

SCOTTIE
Go on

He pushes her through and follows her in

INT BELL TOWER - (NIGHT)

The black shadows are cut by shafts of moonlight Heavy beams
support the great bell hanging at the center There are

additional temporary support beams Judy backs up against
the stonework as Scottie looks about

SCOTTIE
You both hid behind there mmm
‘til everything was clear then
sneaked down and drove back to the

city

(Glances at her)
And then You were his girl What
happened to you

She stares at him wide-eyed with apprehension

SCOTTIE
Did he ditch you

An almost imperceptible nod from her Scottie almost laughs

SCOTTIE
Oh Judy When he had all her money
and the freedom and the power he
ditched you What a shame But he
knew he was safe You couldnt talk
Didnt he give you anything

JUDY
(Faintly)
Some money
SCOTTIE

And the necklace Carlottas necklace
That was your mistake Judy One
shouldnt keep souvenirs of a killing
You shouldnt have been that
sentimental

A moment as he stares at her then he advances on her slowly

JUDY
(Apprehensive)
What are you going to do

SCOTTIE
I loved you Madeleine

JUDY

(Desperately)
I was safe when you found me there
was nothing you could prove But
when I saw you again I couldnt run
away I loved you so I walked into
danger and let you change me again
because I loved you and wanted you

(She throws herself

into his arms)
Scottie please You love me now
Love me Keep me safe

And she is in his arms pressing tightly against him in
desperation and he holds her tight and they kiss deeply
passionately The kiss ends but they remain together holding
together and Scotties eyes are tight with pain and the
emotion of hating her and hating himself for loving her

JUDY
(softly pleading)

Love me keep me safe

SCOTTIE
(Whispering)
Too late too late theres no
bringing her back
Suddenly Judys eyes looking past him go wide with horror
FROM JUDYS POINT OF VIEW

The figure of a woman draped in black stands motionless in
the shadows by the door

JUDY IN SCOTTIES ARMS TRANSFIXED
FROM JUDYS POINT OF VIEW

The black figure moves forward seems to merge with the shadow
and become part of them

JUDY
Pulls out of Scotties arms and backs away terrified

JUDY
(Whispering)
No no

She is backing perilously close to the edge of the drop below
Scottie stares at her for a moment then swings around to
see what she is looking at

FROM SCOTTIES POINT OF VIEW

The black figure advances into a shaft of moonlight It is a
nun

THE NUN
(Simply)
I heard voices

There is a terrible scream Scottie swings around again
steps quickly to the edge and looks down He backs away his
face tight with horror and holds the stonework for support
The nun comes into the SHOT She steels herself to look below
She crosses herself

THE NUN
God have mercy

She reaches out for the bell cord
INT THE BELL TOWER - (NIGHT)
The church bell is tolling It swings in and out of the
picture Through the archway we can see the Mission garden

below Figures are hurrying across toward the church

then moves quickly to the table on which are bottles glasses
and ice She starts to mix a strong highball and does not
turn as she hears the front door open Scottie enters and
closes the door behind him His face is a mask

He moves slowly across the room and stands by the window
with the view of San Francisco beyond him and looks straight
ahead thinking Midge picks up the highball glances over

at him picks up the bottle and pours in another slug Then
moves across the room and holds out the drink Scottie takes
it Midge moves away picks up her own drink sits down and
looks across the room Scottie stands quietly immobile

stares out at the city
