INT BEDROOM - MORNING 1

ZEV 90 opens his effervescent blue eyes with a shudder
He is drenched in sweat He was having a bad dream His
eyes a valley surrounded by deep mountainous wrinkles
attempt to adjust to the dim light With an aged deep
voice bearing thick traces of an Eastern European accent
the old man mutters a half question

ZEV
Ruth

Zev slowly turns his head to the right expecting to find
his wife However nobody is there

He strains his eyes at the slightly creased pillow and
tucked in sheet trying to get a grasp on the situation

After a moment he sits up and stares ahead at a mirror
Instead of seeing his aged reflection though he looks at a
white sheet This room has been prepared for sitting shiva -
- the Jewish tradition of mourning

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 2

A PIANO takes up a quarter of the small room Like in the
bedroom the mirrors are covered with white sheets

PAULA black 40s heavyset Senegalese knits a sweater on a
worn-in reclining chair

ZEV (0C)
Where is my wife
Paula is startled but it is Zev -- standing timidly in the
bedroom doorway -- who is afraid
PAULA

Mr Guttman You can’t be
sneaking up on me like that

ZEV
Where is my wife Where is Ruth

Paula stands with a truly sympathetic look on her face
PAULA
I’m sorry Mr Guttman Your wife
passed away about a week ago
Zev takes in this devastating information Dead A week

ago Zev takes a seat on the piano bench and begins to rub
his forehead with his arthritic hands

ZEV
Who are you

PAULA
My name’s Paula I was Mrs
Guttman’s nursing aide Your family
asked me to help out for another
week or two

ZEV
(meekly)
I’m a little confused

PAULA
It’s okay Mr Guttman You’ve
been through a lot the last week

Paula gives Zev the most compassionate smile she can
muster despite this being a conversation she’s probably
had before Zev looks around the apartment as if he’s a
visitor and not the tenant

PAULA (CONTD)

Let’s get some breakfast You’ve
been feeling better after
breakfast

Paula approaches Zev and takes his hand He’s as lost as a
little child who’s been separated from his parents

INT HALLWAY —- DAY 3

There are few places in the world as sterile as the
hallways of a senior housing community The olive green
diamond patterned carpet has been vacuumed every day The
fluorescent overhead lights are without a trace of dust
The flowers on wooden tables by the elevator banks are as
fake as the lithographs hanging above them

Zev and Paula exit the apartment Zev walks with a slight
shuffle but is more than able to get around by himself

CELE nonagenarian walks toward Zev pushing a walker with
tennis balls attached to the bottom She smiles at him as
she gets closer

CELE
Good morning Zev

ZEV
Good morning

CELE
I hope you’re not too hungry
Breakfast is crummy as usual

ZEV
That’s okay I’m not too hungry

Cele continues her journey down the hallway Zev gives her
a second look When Cele’s out of earshot Paula whispers

PAULA
That’s Cele She was friends with
your wife

ZEV
(irritated)
I know who she is

Like most people suffering from dementia it’s very easy
for Zev to become irritated and suffer mood swings

INT CAFETERIA - DAY 4

Zev and Paula sit at a long rectangular table eating
breakfast The eggs toast and fruit are separated on a
compartmentalized plastic dish on an orange plastic tray

Most of the SENIORS in the cafeteria like Zev reside in the
INDEPENDENT LIVING WING of the senior housing community
However there are others who require full time CARETAKERS
and reside in the ASSISTED LIVING WING

MAX a feeble old man in a wheelchair is one such man He
gets pushed up to the table by his AIDE Max is on the
opposite side of the spectrum as Zev his body has gone to
hell but his brain is extremely acute There’s an oxygen
tank attached to Max’s wheelchair The necessity of it is
quickly apparent as he struggles to breathe as he talks

MAX
Can you -- give us -- a minute
Max like Zev enunciates every word when he speaks -- an

indication that English is their second language

PAULA
No problem Max

Zev shoots Paula an angry look with his piercing eyes
ZEV

You don’t need to tell me
everyone’s name

Paula and Max’s aide gossip in their native tongue as they
walk away Max looks around to make sure the coast is clear

MAX

Tonight is the last night --
sitting shiva for Ruth

(long breath)
Do you remember -- what you said -
- you would do

(long breath)
What you said -- you would do --
when Ruth died

Zev thinks about it but comes up blank

ZEV
No

Zev shakes his head in frustration Max gathers his breath

MAX
It’s okay
(long breath)
I wrote everything down -- so you

could remember

Max pats his jacket pocket as if something is inside He
then starts to cough uncontrollably His aide walks over
and inserts the oxygen nose-clip into Max’s nostrils

MAXS AIDE
Come on Mr Rosenbaum Time for
a nap

The aide takes Max away

INT ZEV’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 5

A MINYAN is gathered It’s a big crowd for a small
apartment ZEV’S CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN GREAT
GRANDCHILDREN and FRIENDS are all present and being led
through the prayers by a RABBI

Zev wears black slacks a white button down shirt and an
old tweed professor’s blazer with patches on the elbows He
is also the only one without their Siddur opened this is
not a man who believes in god

The adults -- sans Zev -- recite KADDISH They’ve all got
the prayer committed to memory

The minyan is winding down Family and friends finish their

Zev sits on the couch receiving words of condolence as
people make their way out of the apartment His GREAT
GRANDDAUGHTER 8 sits next to him

Max gets wheeled up to the great granddaughter

MAX
Do you know -- when that picture -
- was taken

Max shakily points at a BLACK AND WHITE WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH
of Zev and RUTH 20 beautiful The photo stands on an end
table amongst family portraits

The great granddaughter shakes her head no Max looks at
Zev who also doesn’t seem to have a clue

MAX (CONTD)
That is from -- their wedding day
-- in 1946

GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER
Did you meet Nanny in Germany

There’s recognition in Zev’s eyes
ZEV
No I met her in America I met her

at Coney Island

The great granddaughter looks transfixed at the picture

MAX
She was beautiful -- wasn’t she
(off her nod)
Why don’t you -- show the picture --

to your brother

The great granddaughter excitedly takes the picture and walks
across the room to her brother ADAM who stands next to their
MOTHER and FATHER Zev watches her cross the room with pride
in his eyes

GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER
Adam look at this

As soon as she’s gone Max slowly reaches into his coat
pocket and pulls out an envelope Zev’s name is written
across it Max’s hands shake almost uncontrollably as he
gives the envelope to Zev as slyly as possible Zev looks at
it confused

MAX
Now stand up -- tell everyone --
youre tired -- and go read it

Zev follows Max’s orders He rises from the couch and
announces to the room

ZEV
I am tired I am going to bed now

CHARLES 60s Zev’s son approaches and gently helps his dad
to the bedroom It’s only a small gesture but you can see how
much he loves his father
CHARLES

It’s okay Dad It’s been a long

week
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 7
Zev sits down on the bed and stares at the envelope He opens
it and pulls out A STACK OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS Even if he
had control of all his faculties he’d still be bewildered
Zev then pulls out a TICKET and a THICK STAPLED LETTER which
he begins to read He does not read it out loud but the power
of the words are clear by the look on his face
After a beat he stands up and walks to his closet He bends
down and retrieves a small black TOILETRY BAG
INT LIVING ROOM - 300 AM 8

Zev exits his bedroom carrying only the toiletry bag

proceeds through the front doors which gently slide open

INT TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING 16

Zev shuffles his way to his train car Other TRAVELERS --
and their bags -- make their way onboard

The station puts Zev at unease He’s nervous The sounds of
trains coming and going and whistles piercing the air echo
inside his head building to a crescendo

CONDUCTOR

Zev wipes off his sweaty forehead gathers his courage and
steps onboard

We voyeuristically watch through the train’s windows as Zev
makes his way down the aisle and finds his assigned seat He
then takes out the letter and begins to read it again After
a beat he removes a pen from his blazer and crosses
something off the page

it’s very common following the
death of a spouse for more signs of
neurocognitive disorders to emerge
Have you noticed that your father’s
been having mood swings Or that he
rarely plays the piano anymore

We were just so busy with your mom
that I guess I dismissed them

Rebecca turns to Charles

Charles sits back down the truth weighing on him He runs

his hands

going to need to reassess his

Zev brushes up against the wall looking for a light
switch After a few seconds of flickering a light turns
on Zev looks around the room completely at a loss He
sees the Glock on the bedside table This is the last thing
he expected to see

He approaches the gun and carefully picks it up He turns

it over examining it He then notices the message on his

left hand -- “Read Letter” -- and sees the envelope on the
bed He sits down picks up the letter and begins to read
After a beat a tear streams down his cheek

He continues to read After another moment he stops and
LIFTS HIS LEFT ARM examining his tattoo He couldn’t
possibly forget about that could he

An OHIO TAXI pulls up to the front of a two story post-

Zev exits the taxi and slowly shuffles up the driveway
under his arm he carries his toiletry bag the only place
his Glock could be

The taxi waits in front

Zev holds a black metal railing as he climbs the house’s
six front steps As he gets closer he can faintly hear the
white noise of a VACUUM on the other side of the door He
takes a piece of paper out of his pocket which has the
name “Rudy Kurlander” written on it with the address of
where he’s at

Zev rings the bell While he waits for somebody to answer he
studies the paper After a beat he rings the bell again
Finally the vacuuming stops and the front door opens A
CLEANING LADY 20s stands there armed with a Hoover

filters from the sand and drinking
our precious water when we saw
Rommel’s Storch flying right at us
All of a sudden something dropped
from the sky and knocked my canteen
right out of my hand spilling my
water It was a note wrapped
around a rock I opened it and it
said “If you don’t move on at once
I shall come down” And he signed

it -- Rommel So we got back in our

the open dunes

Zev continues to sit on the front steps reading the letter
and staring at the occasional car that passes in this not-
so-trafficked neighborhood The handwritten message on his
hand -- “Read Letter” -- is beginning to fade

A NORTHWEST COURIERS TRUCK pulls up in front of the house
The COURIER hops out carrying a small BOX dodges the dog
shit and approaches the front door

Good morning

The courier drops off the box by the front door The dog
agitated woofs and scrapes from the inside

JOHN KURLANDER 50s slightly overweight steps out of the

Zev enters the house which is barren There’s not much for
furniture except an old couch some reclining chairs and a
relatively archaic television set This is the house of
someone who doesn’t spend much time at home

There’s a couple of pictures on the wall which draw Zev’s
attention He approaches a photo and stares at RUDY

and placing it on the TV He also untucks and unbuttons his

out the side of his head onto the wall John immediately
drops to the floor a puddle of blood pooling around him

Zev stands surveying the scene He gently places down the
gun on the coffee table and begins to RUB HIS HAND The
gun’s recoil -- albeit weak -- has hurt his arthritic
joints He slowly rotates his wrist clearly in pain

Zev takes out the letter and shakily crosses out Rudy
Kurlander 3’s name and writes “Not him”

Zev puts the letter back into his jacket
He then stands up trying to compose himself

He slowly starts to shuffle out of the room However
there’s a river of blood to cross Although it’s only about
six inches in width it takes considerable concentration
and agility to step over it

dark red fluid resulting in a snail’s trail of blood as he
makes his way out of the room

Department They haven’t spoken to

statement But we’re assured we
will hear from them in some way

stunned I’ve talked to some who

NOTE TO READER ON FALSE MEMORY 124

Dr John F Kihlstrom Distinguished Professor of Psychology
at the University of California Berkley defines False Memory
Syndrome as

A condition in which a persons identity and interpersonal
relationships are centered around a memory of traumatic
experience which is objectively false but in which the person
strongly believesFalse Memory Syndrome is especially
destructive because the person assiduously avoids
confrontation with any evidence that might challenge the
memory Thus it takes on a life of its own encapsulated and
resistant to correction

Dr Richard W Shulman MDCM FRCPC one of the foremost
experts in the field of psychotropics read REMEMBER and
explained that if a person has lived under an alias for a
significant amount of time -- 60 to 70 years -- it would be
“plausible that his alias has actually become his long-term
memory” Furthermore Dr Shulman says that “when confronted
with the truth the individual would be able to retrieve
the memory of his true identity and have the ability to
reflect on his past behavior”
