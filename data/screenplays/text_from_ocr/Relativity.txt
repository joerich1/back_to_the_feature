PARADIGM 288-8000
INT RON DODDLING’S OFFICE- AFTERNOON

RON DODDLING

a bookish man with a crooked nose

in a scholarly office wallpapered with diplomas

RON

My second cousin Clive was
adopted His parents successfully
hid this fact from him for most of
his adult life They felt
revealing the truth bore no
foreseeable benefit particularly
in his more formative years It
wasn’t until he was thirty-four
that he discovered it for himself

calmly sits

FRANKLIN and CLAIRE FERGUSSON a pair of slightly frazzled
fifty-somethings sit on a corduroy sofa across the room

How

CLAIRE

RON

Well Clive was an unabashed
alcoholic and ravenous drug fiend
It was after an evening of heavy
drinking and heroin use that he and
five friends who he commonly
referred to as The Clive Five
broke into his parents’ house while
they were vacationing in Beirut

FRANKLIN

Beirut

CLAIRE

Please continue

RON

While The Five were busy rehabbing
the downstairs with aluminum
baseball bats Clive presumably
looking to finance his next foray
in debauchery broke into the
upstairs safe only to find his
adoption papers preserved like the
day they were signed

CLAIRE

So what happened

RON

He went completely insane
Franklin sits forward on the sofa

FRANKLIN
You’re not helping my case here
Ron

RON

As your friend and author of two
self-published books on familial
diplomacy my goal isn’t to
persuade your decision one way or
another It’s to give you a
broader picture on how you two
together might handle your
situation You can look at Clive’s
case from two different view
points As a negative he’s now
certifiably insane with absolutely
no hope of recovery On the
positive side apart from the
highly regimented doses of
psychotropic medicines he’s now
drug-free

Franklin and Claire stare blankly at Ron

RON (cont’d)
I guess I’m saying there isn’t a
right or wrong answer to this
debate You just have to be
content with whatever decision you
make and hope that nobody loses
their mind

INT STATION WAGON - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Franklin and Claire shut the doors to a brown early-nineties
station wagon

FRANKLIN
And we invited him to our
anniversary party

He starts the engine

CLAIRE
All right let’s do it

Franklin looks at her

FRANKLIN
What
CLAIRE
As long you promise me one thing

FRANKLIN
What

CLAIRE
Promise me that no matter what
everything will turn out hunky
dory

FRANKLIN
Hunky dory

CLAIRE
Just promise

Frank thinks about it for a moment

FRANKLIN
All rightI promise

EXT DRIVEWAY - FERGUSSON HOME - AFTERNOON

Out of nowhere a yellow compact car fish tails into the
driveway of a modest late-seventies two-story home and comes

green polo shoves the car door open jumps onto the driveway

decorated home finished with wood paneling and garage sale
furniture He frantically looks around

CHARLES

Charles made it first

He darts into the kitchen

CHARLES (contd)
Is anyone here

THE HOUSE IS SILENT
He nervously rushes into the living room and sits on a green

flowered sofa He grabs a book from a side table flips it
open and attempts to catch his breath
CHARLES (contd)
Not right

He throws the book on the floor jumps up and scurries out of
the room

INT TOOL SHED - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Charles thrusts himself into a packed tool shed He
frantically surveys the contents of a cluttered work bench

EXT BACKYARD - FERGUSSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Charles now in goggles and protective headphones holds a
chain saw in the middle of the backyard He tugs the start
chord It sputters momentarily He tries againnothing

CHARLES
For the love of all things holy and
cotton-like please

He pulls it a third time and the CHAIN SAW ROARS TO LIFE WITH
A MENACING MECHANICAL SCREAM

Yes YES

EXT DRIVEWAY - FERGUSSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER

A white four-door pulls into the driveway

INT VINCENT’S CAR - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

VINCENT FERGUSSON a nervous sort of a man wearing a
horseshoe-shaped travel cushion around his neck shifts the
car in park and nervously exhales

VINCENT
I feel sick to my stomach

GWENIVERE (0S)
This is something you should’ve
done two years ago

GWENIVERE a fare skinned early-thirty-something sits on the
passenger-side She also has a horseshoe-shaped travel
cushion hugging her neck

VINCENT
Tell my parents we’re married
They think we just met

GWENIVERE
Just remember what I said

anniversary this weekend They’ve
invited a lot of the people They
can’t kill you

Vincent looks at her

VINCENT
You said that I don’t remember
you saying that

That’s because you lose your
hearing when you’re nervous

Vincent thinks about it for a moment

VINCENT
I hear a chain saw

around him

Charles

Charles looks up The chain saw begins to jerk violently
He holds on awkwardly until it comes to a GRINDING HALT A
puff of black smoke shoots out the exhaust
CHARLES
Hey I didn’t hear you guys

VINCENT
What are you doing

Charles thinks a moment

CHARLES

Pubusitic sackworm infestation
VINCENT

What
CHARLES

The number four killer of maples in
North America It’s carried in the
saliva of diseased squirrels

He waves his finger around the base of the tree

CHARLES (contd)
You can tell by the pattern in the
bark this one didn’t have much time
left I’ve been out here for the
past couple of hours negotiating
the placement of its fall

VINCENT
You just passed us fifteen minutes
ago on the way here

Charles wipes saw dust from his forehead

CHARLES
I was out here sawing the

VINCENT
Mom’s going to be a little more
than upset that you’re cutting down
the family tree just to give the
appearance that you’ve been here
longer than you really have

Charles drops his hand

CHARLES
I didn’t realize we had a family
tree

VINCENT

They planted it when Conrad was
born It’s an oak
Charles turns and surveys the damage

VINCENT (contd)
You should know by now you’re the
only one racing

Charles props his goggles on his forehead He stares at the
tree

CHARLES

It made sense at the time

trophy

She releases Charles and looks him over

He examines himself

CHARLES
Am I That’s strange

Gwenivere stands a few feet away waiting an introduction

VINCENT
Mom and Dad this is Gwenivere
Gwen this is Franklin and Claire

Claire walks over to Gwenivere and looks her over

CLAIRE
So this is the mysterious
anthropologist our son has been
hiding from us for the last three
months

VINCENT
I wouldn’t say hiding

GWENIVERE
I wouldn’t say mysterious

Claire bursts forward and embraces Gwenivere in a meaty hug
Gwenivere stumbles backward to catch her balance
INT VINCENT’S ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Claire opens the door to an intensely bright turquoise room

CLAIRE
And this is Vincent’s room where
youll be staying

She sets a stack of towels on the dresser

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Here’s a few towels to hold onto
for yourself The boys have a
history of being openly communal
when it comes to towel usage
Don’t ask me why

She reaches over jerks a swimsuit model poster off the wall
and wads it up

CLAIRE (cont’d)
The party is the day after tomorrow
so you should have enough time to
relax and do whatever So feel
free to make yourself comfortable

Gwenivere stands in the doorway studying the room

GWENIVERE
It’s quite an intense color

CLAIRE
We let the kids choose their own
paint colors when they were
younger Vincent was going through
a turquoise phase at the time
Everything was turquoise for some
reason We almost had him see a
doctor about it

Gwenivere steps up to a mangled clay sculpture placed on a
desk tucked in the corner of the room

GWENIVERE
Did Vincent make this
CLAIRE
Yeah He took a sculpting class in

college
Gwenivere picks it up It’s atrocious from every angle

GWENIVERE
What is it

CLAIRE
It’s what happens when a podiatrist
makes art

EXT DRIVEWAY - FERGUSSSON HOME - AFTERNOON
Franklin tugs on the closed garage door

FRANKLIN
I told Dad we would drive out to
the home tomorrow to see him It’s
been a while since we all had the
chance to get out there together

Charles and Vincent stand a few feet away watching

VINCENT
Don’t we have to get the house
ready for your party

CHARLES
How is Grandpa anyway

CLICK The garage door finally gives way and rolls open
Charles and Vincent stare into the open garage Franklin
steps back to join them

A weathered blue two-seat go-cart with roll bars sits parked
inside the garage

FRANKLIN
She works as good as new

VINCENT
I’m surprised Mom finally let you
fix it after what happened to Uncle
Finnegan

Franklin looks at Vincent

FRANKLIN
What happened to your Uncle
Finnegan was a freak accident that
could have been avoided with the
proper protective equipment
(MORE)

FRANKLIN (contd)
Besides he was an instrumental
case in the scientific development
of skin grafting so it wasn’t a
complete loss

A red hatchback pulls into the driveway behind them
JUDITH FERGUSSON sporting auburn hair glasses and a
orange scarf gets out with a small dog carrier stenciled
with the name “MASCOT” on the side
JUDITH

I said no smoking in my car it

provokes Mascot’s asthma Besides

you know I hate that smell
CONRAD FERGUSSON wearing a pressed white button-up tie
and suit pants follows out of the passenger’s side with a
pipe hanging out his mouth

CONRAD
Don’t even get me started on smell

Judith walks up to him grabs his pipe and throws it

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Hey

JUDITH
I take garlic supplements for my
high cholesterol butt munch

She slugs him in the shoulder

CONRAD
Ouch

She slugs him again

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Damn it

She turns and walks past Franklin Vincent and Charles

JUDITH
Hey guys Hi Dad

FRANKLIN

CONRAD

I was talking about your dog

She slams the door to the house Conrad walks towards the
garage rubbing his shoulder

INT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - EVENING

MASCOT a small scraggly-looking dog walks on a treadmill
tucked in the corner of the room HE LETS OUT A HUSKY BARK

JUDITH
Mascot Silencia

She turns to Gwenivere sitting across the room
JUDITH (contd)
I’m teaching him Spanish For an
older dog I think he’s picking it
up quite well

MASCOT COUGHS OUT ANOTHER BARK

JUDITH (contd)
So Gwenivere’s an interesting name
Is it in your family

GWENIVERE
Actually no It was my father’s
choice He was heavily involved in
Arthurian legend at the time so
naturally

Judith grabs a handful of trail mix from a bowl at her side

JUDITH
Heavily involved

GWENIVERE
Actually destructively obsessed
might better describe it He was
paralyzed in a jousting match when
I was twelve

The handful of NUTS CRUNCH IN JUDITH’S MOUTH

GWENIVERE (contd)
So I’ve read a few of your short
stories I have to say I’m very
impressed I just finished
“Everyone Dead But Me” Your
attention to detail is so raw and
brutally graphic

JUDITH
Welleighteenth century human
castration is a dark topic to
tackle

GWENIVERE
The images still haunt my dreams

JUDITH
Thank you

GWENIVERE
So are you working on anything
right now

JUDITH
Actually I just finished my
first novel

GWENIVERE
Really

JUDITH
I’ve been working on it since I was
twelve I’m giving it to Mom and
Dad for their anniversary

GWENIVERE
What’s it about

JUDITH

It’s a science-fiction thriller
following one woman’s dark journey
of self-discovery in a futuristic
world riddled with political
corruption and social chaos told
through an aggressive blend of
nonlinear narrative techniques
including flash backs flash
forwards and something new I’m
pioneering flash presents

GWENIVERE
Twelve huh

JUDITH
At nearly 4000 pages it’s taken
some time to complete
MASCOT BARKS AGAIN Judith turns around
JUDITH (contd)
Mascot ningin ladridos en la casa

por favor

Mascot stops barking and picks up his step Judith turns
back towards Gwenivere

JUDITH (contd)
He has severe outdoor allergies I
can’t take him for walks outside

Mascot stumbles over and rolls off the treadmill

INT DINING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - EVENING
Conrad forks a mound of lettuce from a salad bowl

CHARLES
Pass the grilled asparagus

Vincent hands a plate of asparagus across the table cluttered
with an eclectic mixture of foods He sits back down in the
only metal fold out chair at the table

Franklin and Claire sit together at the end of the table

FRANKLIN
First of all your mom and I would
like to thank you for coming home
to celebrate our anniversary with
us It really means a lot to have
all of you together under the same
roof again

Charles takes a bite of asparagus

CHARLES
Thanks Dad

FRANKLIN
We just want to tell you that we
love you very much

CLAIRE
Very much

FRANKLIN
It’s crazy how much we love you

Vincent stops eating

VINCENT
What’s wrong with you two

FRANKLIN
What do you mean

VINCENT
You both seem nervous and neither
of you are eating

CHARLES
(mouthful)
What’s wrong with the food

FRANKLIN
Well we have something we would
like to tell all of you It’s kind
of hard to just come out and say

CHARLES
Are you dying

CLAIRE
No

JUDITH

Are you getting a divorce

Conrad looks at Judith

CONRAD
Why would they announce their
divorce two days before their
anniversary

JUDITH
It’s just a question

CONRAD
It’s a stupid question

VINCENT
You’re not getting a divorce are
you

FRANKLIN
You’re all adopted

THE ROOM GOES SILENT Everyone’s attention is frozen on the
end of the table

JUDITH
What’s that supposed to mean

FRANKLIN
Youre still our children and we
love you more than anything We
don’t want this to change the way
you view our relationships in any
way

CONRAD
All right I’m confused

VINCENT
What are you trying to say Dad

FRANKLIN
I’m trying to say that you’re
adopted

JUDITH

What’s that even mean

FRANKLIN
It’s just like it sounds

CHARLES
We’re adopted

FRANKLIN
Yes

JUDITH
Just like Conrad or

CONRAD
What’s that supposed to mean

FRANKLIN
All of you

VINCENT
Dad you’re not making any sense

FRANKLIN
I don’t know a better way to say
it

Claire takes a deep breath

CLAIRE
You’re father and I couldn’t have
children This was the only way we
could experience the glory of being
parents

CONRAD
The glory of being parents

VINCENT
You’re not our real parents

CLAIRE
We ARE your real parents just not
your birth parents

CHARLES
I think I’m going to be sick

He grabs the salad bowl empties it onto the table and leans
over it

VINCENT
You just mean Conrad right

Conrad drops his fork

CONRAD
Hey

FRANKLIN
All of you are adopted

VINCENT
What like me and Charles together
He puts his hand on Charles sitting beside him
still wearing the same shirt

CLAIRE
Sort of

VINCENT
What do you mean “sort of” You
can’t use “sort ofs” Just say it

in plain simple English

FRANKLIN
You’re not really twins

Charles lifts his head from the bowl

CHARLES
What

FRANKLIN
We adopted you two months apart
from each other

CLAIRE
You were so close in age we
thought it was best to package you
as twins

VINCENT
Package us

CHARLES
We’re not twins

FRANKLIN
Charles you’re three months older
than Vincent

VINCENT
What the hell He’s older than me

JUDITH
Give me the bowl

They’re

Judith reaches across the table and grabs the bowl from

Charles

VINCENT
October lst Whose birthday is
that

FRANKLIN
Actually neither of yours We
averaged your birthdays into one
date

CHARLES
What’s mine then

FRANKLIN
August 20th

VINCENT
And mine

CLAIRE
November 17th

CONRAD
Who gives a damn about birthdays
Are any of us even related to each
other

FRANKLIN
By blood no

CONRAD
When did you plan on telling us
this

FRANKLIN
Wellright now

CLAIRE
Frank thought it was time that you
all knew the truth It’s been such
a long time since we had you all
together he thought

FRANKLIN
Wait a second WE thought

CLAIRE
Listen this was your idea

FRANKLIN
Don’t abandon me on this Claire
Ron said we have to swim in pairs

VINCENT
Whos Ron

CONRAD
Hold on a moment I remember being
at the hospital when Judith was
born

FRANKLIN
That was Dr Fontaine’s office

CONRAD
Our dentist

FRANKLIN
We thought there was a slight
chance you’d remember so we staged
the delivery with a few community
theater performers

CLAIRE
Judith was already three months old
at the time

Conrad slaps the table

CONRAD
Damn it

FRANKLIN
We wanted to shield all of you from
having to carry the burden of not
feeling truly a part of a family

VINCENT
So you’re handing that to us now

FRANKLIN
We felt it was appropriate now that
youre mature enough to handle the
truth

VINCENT
Well you got that one wrong

Vincent grabs the bowl from Judith and storms out of the
dining room

GWENIVERE
Well

She sets her napkin on the table

GWENIVERE (contd)
I should go ahead and just

She gets up and follows after Vincent

CHARLES
What about Pop Pop

CLAIRE
Your great grandpa

CHARLES
Yeah what about him Everyone
says I look exactly like him

FRANKLIN
Yeahwe kind of got lucky on that
one

Conrad lifts his head from his hands

CONRAD
But I remember you being pregnant
for months

CLAIRE
I duct taped varying sizes of throw
pillows under my clothing

FRANKLIN
We tried to cover all our bases

CONRAD
Damn it

CHARLES
What a minute My real birthday
was just last week

Franklin and Claire think about it for a moment

FRANKLIN
I guess that’s right yes

CLAIRE
Happy birthday Charles

Judith stands up and grabs her glass

JUDITH
I need air

She leaves the room

JUDITH (0S) (contd)
»e-and alcohol

INT VINCENT’S ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS
Gwenivere opens the door Vincent furiously paces the room

VINCENT
I knew this would happen I knew
if I brought you here something
completely idiotic would happen I
was actually thinking of something
more in the vicinity of you seeing
my dad in his underwear but I had
this deep rooted suspicion this
whole thing would cave in on
itself Why am I surprised

He stops and turns to Gwenivere

VINCENT (contd)
Dad once stopped my dance recital
and demanded it start over because
he was in the restroom

GWENIVERE
Nothing has changed Vincent
They’re still your parents

VINCENT
Weren’t you down there Didn’t you
hear Everything’s changed Those
people aren’t my parents They’re
not my brothers and sisters I
guess it makes some sort of sense
I’m the only one with webbed toes

GWENIVERE
You’re still family

VINCENT
Family What the hell is family
My own twin isn’t related to me
Don’t you see the implications this
has on our lives For all I know
you and I could be related

He studies her face

VINCENT (contd)
We kind of look a like don’t we

GWENIVERE
We’re not related

VINCENT
Stranger things have happened you
know

He begins pacing again

VINCENT (contd)
In some rare cases chimpanzees
have been known to predict military
coups in third world countries

GWENIVERE
I think you need to just sit down
and take a deep breath

VINCENT
What in the hell is that going to
do

GWENIVERE
Ensure lung aeration and promote
relaxation

Vincent steps up to her

VINCENT
Did I ever tell you that when I was
younger I did everything in even
numbers

GWENIVERE
What are you talking about

VINCENT
If I turned on the light I did it
twice If I was chewing food I
ended on an even count I even
blinked in twos

GWENIVERE
Why

VINCENT
For some unknown reason I felt that
if I didn’t something bad would
happen

GWENIVERE
Why are you telling me this

VINCENT
Because there came a point when I
realized I was acting nuts and the
only thing that assured me I wasn’t
actually certifiable was the fact
that I was the product of two
reasonably sane individuals

He backs up
VINCENT (contd)
Now for all I know I AM crazy
My real parents might be complete
lunatics

Gwenivere thinks about it for a long moment

GWENIVERE
You were in dance

VINCENT
I’m sleeping in the car

He shoots past her and leaves the room

INT DINING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS
Vincent storms down the stairs past the dining room

VINCENT
I’m sleeping outside and there’s
nothing anyone can do to stop me

HE SLAMS THE FRONT DOOR ON EXIT

CLAIRE
Does he need a blanket or
something

Conrad is the last one sitting at the table

CONRAD
What about the doctor I remember
the doctor seemed very real

FRANKLIN
He was Dad’s proctologist

CLAIRE
He owed Wendel a favor for some
PI work he had done for him

CONRAD
Grandpa was a private investigator

CLAIRE
You didn’t know that

Conrad stands up

CONRAD
Isn’t it obvious There’s a whole
hell of a lot I don’t know about
this circus-freak-show of a family

He grabs a piece of pizza off the table throws it against
the wall and leaves the room

CONRAD (0S) (contd)
Damn it

EXT BACK PATIO - FERGUSSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Judith takes a swig from her glass and bites her lip as it
goes down

JUDITH
Are you going to be all right

Charles sits at Judith’s feet staring at the ground His
hair is a mess and he’s drained of color

CHARLES
Ill be fineonce I get my
equilibrium back

JUDITH
Do you remember Elliot Bottsworth
who lived down the street

Charles continues staring at the ground

CHARLES
The Korean kid with the over-bite

JUDITH
He had surgery for that but yeah

CHARLES
Sure I remember him

JUDITH
He was adopted and didn’t know
about it for years

Charles lifts his head

CHARLES
Weren’t his parents black

JUDITH
YeahI don’t know how they sold
him that one

Conrad opens the screen door and steps out onto the patio
holding a large box of fireworks He sets it on the patio
table and begins rummaging through it

JUDITH (contd)
What are you doing

CONRAD
Nothing

He pulls out a few packages of bottle rockets and sets them
on the table

JUDITH
Where’d you get those

CONRAD
My closet I was saving them for a
special occasion

CHARLES
Like when

CONRAD
Like now

CHARLES

You call this a special occasion

CONRAD
I’m pretty sure someday when you
look back on the timeline of your
life you’ll qualify today as a red-
letter date

He lifts a large toy tank firework out of the box and
examines it

JUDITH
Right now doesn’t stand out as an
appropriate time for a fireworks
display Conrad

CONRAD
You’re probably right but I don’t
really care I’ve been saving
these damn things for over fifteen
years and I want to use them

CHARLES
Don’t you want to talk about what
happened in there

CONRAD
What’s there to talk about

CHARLES
I just think we should be here for
each other Stick together you
knowlike Voltron

CONRAD
Voltron

He sets down the tank and looks at Charles

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Voltron was a team of robotic cats
from the distant future Their
parents didn’t adopt them or hold
community theater at their dentist
office

CHARLES
But they stuck together

Conrad points at Charles

CONRAD
Leave Voltron out of this

CHARLES
I’m just saying we’re still
family We’re all going through
the same thing

CONRAD
The same thing Do you have any
clue to what they did to me

CHARLES
You I thought I was Vincent’s
twin my entire life We wore
matching clothes all the way
through junior high

Conrad points towards the house

CONRAD
I went to Lamaze class with those
two every week for four months I
still remember the hard labor
breathing technique

He begins breathing in rapid bursts

JUDITH
All right

Conrad stops breathing He and Charles look at Judith

JUDITH (contd)
If we’re going to do this let’s
just do it

She finishes off her drink and tosses it on the ground

CUT TO

EXT BACK PATIO - FERGUSSON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Judith Charles and Conrad are now standing side by side
unenthusiastically holding lit sparklers

JUDITH
So what now

CHARLES
I think we’re supposed to wave them
aroundspell our names and stuff

Judith lamely waves her sparkler around Charles stares into
the backyard

CHARLES (contd)
Remember that time we all camped
out back here We set up tents
cooked out and everything That
was fun right That’s kind of
like what real families do

JUDITH
Didn’t Vincent fall into the fire

CONRAD
Nothat was me

JUDITH
Yeah that was a good time

Charles takes a deep breath

CHARLES
Why can’t things just stay the way
they used to be

Charles’ sparkler burns out

He turns to Conrad and steps towards him with open arms
Conrad backs away

CONRAD
What are you doing
CHARLES
Giving you a hug
CONRAD
Why
CHARLES
You’re my brother I want to give
you a hug

He steps forward again Conrad backs away further holding
his sparkler in front of him

CONRAD
Dont

CHARLES
Why not

CONRAD

Because I’m not in the mood for a
hug right now

Charles steps closer Conrad nervously backs into the table
His sparkler goes out

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Damn it Stay away from me
Charles If you touch me I’m going
to lose it

CHARLES
Why

CONRAD
I just don’t want a hug all right

He points at Judith
CONRAD (cont’‘d)

If you have to hug something hug
her

Charles turns to Judith Judith’s sparkler is still cracking
away

JUDITH
I’1ll pass for now thanks

CONRAD
Just give him a hug Judith

JUDITH
I’m still sparkling here Why
can’t you He asked you first

CONRAD
Because I don’t like hugs I never
have They’re awkward invasive
and just plain inappropriate I
hope whoever invented the damn idea
suffered an agonizing and untimely

death

JUDITH
That’s a little harsh don’t you
think

CHARLES

It’s only a hug
He grabs the box of fireworks

CONRAD
You two can do whatever you want

He storms towards the house
CONRAD (cont’‘d)
As far as I’m concerned it’s every

man for himself

He slams the screen door shut Judith turns back to her
sparkler She waves it around

JUDITH
Why won’t mine die out

She shakes it harder

JUDITH (contd)
Die damn it

Suddenly Charles bursts into tears

CHARLES
(intensely weeping)
Why us Why now Why oh why

He begins stomping on the ground

Ahhhh

WEEPING CAN BE HEARD FROM OUTSIDE
FRANKLIN
I don’t actually think it went that
bad

Claire looks at him

CLAIRE
You don’t think it went that bad

Don’t you hear that

FRANKLIN
I didn’t get punched For some
reason I thought I might get

punched
Claire leans over and slugs Franklin in the shoulder
FRANKLIN (cont’d)
Ahhh

CLAIRE
There How well do you think it

went now
She pushes her chair out and stands up
FRANKLIN
Claire

She grabs her glass and stomps out of the room leaving
Franklin alone with the MUFFLED SOUND OF CHARLES’ OUTDOOR

INT CHARLES’ ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - MORNING

A fatigued Charles sits on the floor watching two small cars
chasing each other on a winding electric race track laid out
in the middle of his orange room

A tear sprints down his face

INT KITCHEN - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Claire stands over the stove staring at a sizzling pancake
After a long moment she flips it over It’s burnt

EXT FERGUSSON HOME - MORNING

Out of nowhere A MASSIVE CRACK OF WOOD RIPS THROUGH THE AIR
and the large Oak tree standing along the edge of the
backyard tips over and crashes down onto the house

INT JUDITH’S ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

A LARGE BRANCH SMASHES THROUGH JUDITH’S WINDOW showering
glass into her red-painted room Judith pulls the covers
over her head as pieces of glass rain onto her bed

INT CHARLES’ ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Charles gets up and looks out his window One of his race
cars drops from the track’s upside-down loop

INT BACKYARD - FERGUSSON HOME - LATER

The massive tree is stretched across the lawn and climbs the
house near its peak Franklin Claire Gwenivere and Conrad
in varying degrees of sleepwear examine the damage

FRANKLIN
It must’ve caught a bad breeze

CLAIRE
I’ve never heard of a bad breeze
taking down a tree this size

CONRAD
I’ve never heard of a bad breeze

CHARLES (0OS)
Bad things happen you know

Everyone turns around Charles stands a few yards behind
them still in yesterday’s clothes He’s pale and clammy

CHARLES (contd)
Trees fall

CLAIRE
Are you all right
GWENIVERE
Charles wasn’t this
CHARLES
One of my most beloved trees Yes
GWENIVERE
No just yesterday wasn’t this the
tree
CHARLES

I claimed I would one day give my
marriage vows in its late morning
shade Yes this is the one

Thank you Gwenivere I appreciate
you bringing it up

Gwenivere gets it

CONRAD
You want to get married in the
backyard

CHARLES
Yes

CONRAD

Under the family tree

CHARLES

Why am I being interrogated about
one of my most heart-felt wishes in
the wake of this horrific natural
disaster And why didn’t I know
anything about us having a family
tree Does nothing make sense in
this filthy forsaken world

Judith walks up to Charles’ side

JUDITH
How’d this happen
She looks

CLAIRE
We don’t quite know yet Are you
okay

JUDITH
I’m fine

at Charles He’s sweating profusely

JUDITH (contd)
What’s wrong with you

CLAIRE
Charles why don’t you go inside
I made ‘dress your own pancakes’

CHARLES
Do you have bacon and cheddar
cheese

CLAIRE
Of course

CONRAD
You still like bacon and cheddar
cheese on your pancakes

CHARLES
What you have a problem with bacon
and cheddar cheese on pancakes

CONRAD
Yeahyeah I do

CHARLES
Then why don’t you come over here
and say it to my face

CLAIRE
Listen why don’t we all go inside
and have pancakes

CONRAD
Because maybe we don’t want
pancakes

CLAIRE
Listen I realize you might still
be upset with us but don’t take it
out on my pancakes They deserve
to be eaten

CONRAD
I’m sure if your pancakes had their
way they would rather be left
alone

JUDITH
I believe that if any form of food
had the capacity of conscious
thought being consumed would be
seen as a glorious fate

CONRAD
Okay that’s officially the dumbest
thing I’ve ever heard

JUDITH
What’s your problem

CONRAD
Besides having to stomach your
theories on the topic of food
philosophy I don’t know It
might be the recent revelation my
childhood was a complete lie

FRANKLIN
Conrad

CONRAD
What if I needed a part Did
either of you think of that

FRANKLIN
What are you talking about

CONRAD
A blood transfusion or organ
transplant

CLAIRE
You know we’d give you anything we
had

CONRAD

Parts aren’t interchangeable For
all I know I’m a Bentley and
you’re all Pintos

FRANKLIN
I don’t think it works that way

JUDITH
Why are you a Bentley

CLAIRE
We all might be Bentleys

CONRAD
I’m just trying to make a point
Claire

JUDITH

How’s that working out for you

CONRAD
Shut it Judith

CLAIRE
Did you just call me Claire

Gwenivere looks around the group

GWENIVERE
Where’s Vincent

CUT TO

EXT DRIVEWAY - FERGUSSSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Gwenivere and Claire stand in the driveway staring into
Vincent’s car The backseat looks like a campsite

CLAIRE
Did you see him this morning

GWENIVERE
No I woke up when the tree fell

CLAIRE
All the cars are here He probably
just ran away

GWENIVERE
Ran away

CLAIRE
He used to run away a lot when he
was younger

GWENIVERE
How much is a lot

CLAIRE
I’d say at least once a month

GWENIVERE
Why

CLAIRE
I don’t know He never seemed to
need a reason The first couple
times had us all completely
panicked but after about the fifth
time or so we learned it was just
a waiting game He always returned
when he was ready Sometimes a few
hours Once it was a couple of
days

Claire squints into the car

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Is that a bucket of fried chicken
on the floor

THE GARAGE DOOR IS PULLED OPEN Charles is inside standing
beside Blue suited in a helmet and motorcycle goggles

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Where are you going

CHARLES
Out

CLAIRE
Don’t be gone too long We’re
going to visit grandpa at the home
in a little bit

Charles adjusts his goggles

CHARLES
Gwenivere could I speak with you
for a moment

GWENIVERE
Sure

She walks over and steps into the garage

CHARLES
(whispering)
That was the tree from yesterday

GWENIVERE
I know

CHARLES
I can trust you right You’re not
a snitch are you

GWENIVERE

CHARLES
Then let’s just keep this between
you me and Vincent Have you seen
him this morning

GWENIVERE
No He’s missing

CHARLES
Missing Did he run away again

GWENIVERE
I don’t know

CHARLES
You don’t do you

He puts his hand on her cheek

CHARLES (contd)
I can see that in your eyes

He grabs the stick and shifts it into high gear

EXT DR EPSTEIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

CHARLES RINGS THE DOORBELL of a large two-story brick home
MRS EPSTEIN a quiet woman in her mid-sixties answers the
door

MRS EPSTEIN
Can I help you

Charles takes off his helmet

CHARLES
Is Dr Epstein in I’m one of his
former patients Charles Fergusson

MRS EPSTEIN
He’s just finishing up his morning
workout in the backyard

Dr Epstein takes a long drag on a half spent Cuban He’s a
distinguished older man tucked confidently behind a large
mahogany desk

DR EPSTEIN
It’s been quite a long time
Charles

Charles sits across the room on an alligator skin love seat

CHARLES
About fifteen years

DR EPSTEIN
How have you been

CHARLES
Well I just found out I’m adopted

DR EPSTEIN
What would you like me to do for
you

CHARLES
I don’t really know but I thought
you might have experience with this
sort of thing in your line of work

DR EPSTEIN
I’m a pediatrician This isn’t
really my area of expertise

CHARLES
Can you prescribe me something
Or

DR EPSTEIN
How are you feeling right now

CHARLES
I have a mixture of emotions

DR EPSTEIN
Sadness

CHARLES
There have been a few
uncontrollable bouts of crying

yes
DR EPSTEIN
Anger
CHARLES
A little
DR EPSTEIN
Constipation

CHARLES
Nonot really

DR EPSTEIN
Then there’s nothing I can do for
you

Charles sits forward

CHARLES
You’ve known me for nearly thirty
years isn’t there something you
can do that might help

Dr Epstein sets down his cigar

DR EPSTEIN
My son Carl wrecked my car once
Actually I should preface this
story by clarifying he’s my step-
son and a narcoleptic

CHARLES
Okay

DR EPSTEIN
He completely gutted 75000 worth
of German engineering and walked
away without a single scratch Not
that I wished him bodily harm but
what’s a broken leg or lacerated
jawline if it teaches him to ask
before taking a nap at seventy-
miles-per-hour

CHARLES
Good point

DR EPSTEIN

Needless to say I was upset A
barrage of feelings swept over me
not unlike your emotional cocktail
you’re dealing with right now
Then someone gave me a piece of
advice that changed everything

CHARLES
What was it

DR EPSTEIN
Kill a pawn

CHARLES
Kill a pawn

DR EPSTEIN
Do you play chess

CHARLES
I’m more of a checkers kind of guy

DR EPSTEIN
Well try to look at your situation
like a game of chess If there’s
no chance of eliminating the King
and winning the match then choose
one pawn on the board and do
everything you can to take it out
In your case since you can’t
change the fact you were adopted
select one item from your grocery
list of issues that you’re dealing
with because of it and attack it
with everything youve got

CHARLES
What about everything else

DR EPSTEIN
Forget it Life’s too short to
stress the things you can do
nothing to service If there’s no
check mate pick a pawn and kill
it It’s better to make one small
mark than to be completely
railroaded by your circumstance

CHARLES
What was yours What did you do

DR EPSTEIN
I kicked Carl out He was thirty-
five and had a bad habit of
shoplifting nasal spray That book
was way past over due

Charles takes it all in

DR EPSTEIN (contd)
May I ask you a question

CHARLES
Okay

Dr Epstein sits forward in his chair
DR EPSTEIN
What size of Kevlar jacket do you

wear

CUT TO

EXT BACKYARD - DR EPSTEIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

and falls backwards

Claire tips back a half empty bottle of Bourbon and cringes
as it goes down

Judith walks into the kitchen Claire quickly whips the
bottle against the wall IT SHATTERS WITH LOUD CRASH She
acts like nothing happened

CLAIRE
Hi Judith
Judith opens a cabinet and pulls a package of garbage bags
CLAIRE (cont’d)
Conrad isn’t calling me Mom
anymore

She opens a drawer and grabs two rolls of duct tape

CLAIRE (cont’d)
I’m still Mom you know

Judith doesn’t respond

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Are you not talking to me now

JUDITH
I’m still talking to you

CLAIRE
Just saying you’re still talking to
me isn’t really talking to me

Judith shuts the drawer

JUDITH
What do you want me to say

CLAIRE
Anything The idle chit-chat of
your average mother and daughter
You knowhow are you What are
you doing with two rolls of duct
tape and our entire supply of
industrial size garbage bags

JUDITH
Okay

She tucks the garbage bags under her arm and addresses
Claire

JUDITH (contd)
To answer the first question
physically I’m fine Emotionally
I have to say I’m a little on
edge

(MORE )

JUDITH (contd)
Not only by the news I’m not
biologically related to anyone I
consider family but also by the
fact that I was awakened by an
eight foot tree limb crashing
through my bedroom window

CLAIRE
And the second question

JUDITH
What am I doing with two rolls of
duct tape and your entire supply of
industrial size garbage bags I’m
going to take the next hour to
clean my room Then if I still
have time craft a make-shift
window before Mascot’s throat
swells shut from the outside
allergens

Claire waits another moment

CLAIRE
Are you still calling me Mom

JUDITH
Sure

CLAIRE
You’re a good daughter Judith
You always have been How’s your
writing coming by the way

JUDITH
I didn’t know you drank Bourbon

Claire stares at Judith as liquor pours down the kitchen wall
behind her

CLAIRE
I like a good punch in the gut now
and then

INT ATTIC - FERGUSSON HOME - DAY

Conrad pulls an old photo album out of a large box in the
middle of a packed attic He thumbs through a few pages and
stops

The album reveals a photo of a much younger Claire and
Franklin with two small toddlers and a five year old Conrad

He turns the page to a collage of pictures of the family at
Judith’s birth Claire is in a hospital gown next to the
kids A dentist chair tucked in the background

Conrad shuts the book and throws it on a stack of framed
pictures He stands up and freezes He walks forward with
his eyes locked on something

INT JUDITH’S ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Judith hand saws at the thick limb protruding through her
window Mascot sits in his carrier HE SNEEZES VIOLENTLY

Conrad walks past the doorway then returns holding a pellet
gun and a few framed pictures He notices a large manuscript
sitting on a sticker-covered dresser

CONRAD
You’re still going to give it to
them aren’t you

She stops sawing and looks at him

JUDITH
Yes I am

CONRAD
Would it change anything if I said
that I think that’s a stupid thing
to do

JUDITH
Where’d you get the pellet gun

CONRAD
From the attic I snagged a few
family pictures for target

practice

JUDITH
Mom’s not going to like that
Conrad

CONRAD

When you say Mom do you mean the
woman who wore throw pillows to
maliciously deceive an innocent
five year old into rubbing her
supposed pregnant feet every night
for six months

JUDITH
Sure
CONRAD
Well she can suck my face

JUDITH
I’m not sure that means what you
think it means

CONRAD
Whose side are you on anyway

JUDITH
There are no sides Conrad

CONRAD
I don’t think you’ve stopped to
consider the consequences of their
actions Emotional distress pain
and suffering mental anguish and
that’s before I get creative
Legally speaking the monetary
damages alone would be
astounding

JUDITH
What so you want to sue Mom and
Dad now

CONRAD
I’m weighing my options

JUDITH
You’re an idiot

CONRAD
You’re rewarding them for a
lifetime of deception

JUDITH
I’m showing my appreciation for
years of support and encouragement
Who do you think helped put you
through law school

CONRAD
Call it what you want but I’m
taking my organic soy candle set I
bought them back

He begins to leave

JUDITH
They just did what they felt they
had to do

He returns

this so well but in my bookin

GWENIVERE

Vincent don’t have to
FRANKLIN
Charles and Vincent do have to go
They’re just not here right now

CONRAD
I don’t want to be here

JUDITH
What about Gwenivere

FRANKLIN
She’s not even related to Grandpa

CONRAD
Since when does that matter

CLAIRE
Maybe we shouldn’t go

FRANKLIN
Listen I told Dad that we were
coming to see him today and that’s
what we’re going to do I’m a man
of my word

CONRAD
Ha

JUDITH
Does Grandpa still greet people by
palming their heads

CLAIRE
Yes

FRANKLIN
It’s his way of sizing people up
He can’t help it

JUDITH
Why does he need to size people up

FRANKLIN
I don’t know

CONRAD
What about the one-armed guy
Georgio or GoGo or

CLAIRE
Gomez still rooms with him yes

CONRAD
Then I really don’t want to go I
don’t feel comfortable around him

FRANKLIN
You know he lost that arm jumping
on a grenade in Okinawa He saved
eight soldiers’ lives Gomez
Stanwalsky’s a hero

CONRAD
That might be true but I don’t
like stump people They scare me

walks down an aisle and approaches a fatigued looking

Do you have any party hats

ATTENDANT
Like the cone kind you secure to
your head using an attached elastic
chin strap

CHARLES
Yeah

ATTENDANT
No we don’t carry those

CHARLES
Do you have any candy cigarettes

ATTENDANT
You mean the delightfully tasty
sugar sticks designed to look like
the highly addictive tobacco
product

CHARLES
Yes

ATTENDANT
No I think they outlawed those

CHARLES
For a convenience store I’m
finding my experience pretty
inconvenient

ATTENDANT
If you were looking for windshield
washing fluid or an individually
sized bag of potato chips I’m
feeling confident to say you’d find
yourself extremely convenienced

CHARLES
I suppose I would wouldn’t I

The attendant looks into the back room

ATTENDANT
I think we might have a few Uncle
Sam hats in the back room if you
want

CHARLES
Okay
EXT CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Charles puts a few grocery bags in the back of Blue and sits
down in the driver’s seat next to Gwenivere

GWENIVERE
Did you know Vincent used to do
everything in even numbers

CHARLES
Like Even Edward

GWENIVERE
Who

CHARLES
It was a children’s book Dad used
to read to us when we were kids
about a boy who was cursed to do
everything in twos in order to save
his family from being mind raped by
a venomous troll

GWENIVERE
Mind raped

CHARLES
I might be paraphrasing Man I
forgot about that book

He starts Blue then sits back

CHARLES (contd)
It scared the hell out of me I
used to repeat the last word of
every sentence I spokespoke
Like that

GWENIVERE
That’s horrible

CHARLES
I think Dad stopped reading it to
us once he noticed the lasting

effects

GWENIVERE
Vincent didn’t say anything about
this

He must’ve somehow blocked it
out

know

WENDEL
That’s just it You think they
want to know but they don’t

He slaps the table

WENDEL (cont’d)
I wanted to see flying cars damn
it

JUDITH
Youre dying

FRANKLIN
No He’s not dying

WENDEL
Oh great You told them they’re
not your natural born but it
slipped your mind to mention their
grandfather found a lump

JUDITH
Found a lump What’s a lump

FRANKLIN
Dad I was going to tell them

WENDEL
I’ve got breast cancer

FRANKLIN
It’s not breast cancer It’s just
a lump completely harmless The
doctors said they can take it out
with a simple out-patient
procedure

WENDEL
I guess I’m a little confused
Franklin because it seems to me it
would be a hell of a lot harder to
tell your daughter her birth
father’s doing life in a Moscow
prison than to casually mention her
grandfather needs a MANstectomy

Claire puts her head in her hands

FRANKLIN
You don’t have cancer damn it
And for the last time Dad there’s
no N in mastectomy

JUDITH
A Moscow prison

Franklin turns to Judith

INT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - EVENING

Franklin opens the front door They all freeze in the
entrance

FRANKLIN
What the hell is this

The entire living room is decked-out for a ten-year-old’s
birthday party An odd assortment of childhood decorations
are strewn everywhere

Charles and Gwenivere both wearing Uncle Sam hats stand on
an old step ladder hanging a homemade pinata

CHARLES
It’s my birthday party

FRANKLIN
What

Charles steps down from the ladder

CHARLES
For thirty years I’ve shared the
presents split the cakes and if I
remember correctly even swapped
blowing out the candles every other
year And since my actual
birthday was last week and
Vincent’s not around right now I
figure I deserve one good
partyjust for me

Claire surveys the room

CLAIRE
Where’d you get the decorations

CHARLES
Most of them from the attic The
rest Gwen and I made earlier today
with construction paper and a few
pine cones we found in the
backyard

(MORE)

CHARLES (contd)
I feel they carry the festive
enthusiasm I was hoping for and I
would appreciate if everyone would
participate and do the same
He slaps his hands together

CHARLES (contd)
All right any other questions

There aren’t Charles notices a tray of Bingo cupcakes in
Conrad’s hands

CHARLES (contd)
Oh good you brought cupcakes

He steps forward and takes the cupcakes

Conrad now blind-folded viciously swings a whiffle ball bat
in the direction of the pinata

CONRAD
Damn it Where is it

Gwenivere Charles and Judith slowly back away He swings
sporadically again and againit’s ugly

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Where are you you freaking butt

He’s now on the opposite side of the room He falls forward
and smashes a lamp The room goes dark

LATER

Franklin opens the door to the bedroom Claire sits on the
edge of the bed

FRANKLIN
Okay let’s hear it

Claire stands up and marches towards the closet She slides
the door open and begins throwing shoes out

FRANKLIN (cont’d)
Don’t do this

CLAIRE
Oh I’m doing this

FRANKLIN
I said I made a mistake What else
do you want

Claire turns around

CLAIRE
Do you know anything about Quantum
physics

FRANKLIN
What

CLAIRE

Because I would like you to
construct a time machine go back
thirty-six hours and stop yourself
from single-handedly destroying
this once semi-functional family

FRANKLIN
You know I can’t do that
physically speaking

CLAIRE
How many times did I say it How
Many times

FRANKLIN
What

CLAIRE
Leave it alone We don’t need
fixing

FRANKLIN

I thought we agreed on this It’s
what’s best

CLAIRE
This whole thing was your idea
You promised me hunky dory

FRANKLIN
Listen these are aftershocks
Things are bound to settle once
time does its work The truth
always comes back like ripened
raspberries

CLAIRE
What’s that even mean

FRANKLIN
It’s something I read in a poem
once Telling the truth is like
planting a seed That when

CLAIRE
They hate us Franklin We’re
their parents and they hate us

FRANKLIN
They don’t hate us

CLAIRE
Charles is throwing his own belated
birthday party Judith thinks she’s
Communist Conrad was banned from
your father’s nursing home and we
don’t even know where Vincent is
Give me one reason why you see
ripened raspberries in this
family’s future

Franklin has nothing

CLAIRE (cont’d)
For the past three decades there’s
been one thing that I felt I was
truly great at

Franklin is about to answer

CLAIRE (cont’d)
besides foosball

FRANKLIN
I was going to say

CLAIRE
It’s being a mother to those kids
Those emotionally disturbed head

cases we took into this house as
our own

FRANKLIN
Claire

CLAIRE
And now all I have is foosball

Claire turns around and throws more shoes out of her closet
FRANKLIN
So you’re going to sleep in the
closet

She grabs a blanket off the edge of the bed

CLAIRE
Oh I’m all over this closet

She ducks into the closet and SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT

INT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - NIGHT

A chunk of pinata falls to the floor Pieces of pine cone

Charles walks into the room holding a large red suitcase

JUDITH
Where’d you get that

CHARLES
In your closet

JUDITH
I didn’t give you permission to get
that out I don’t care if it’s
your make-up birthday or not were
not playing that

GWENIVERE
What is it

JUDITH
It’s just a stupid game I made up
in eighth grade

CHARLES
Red Wizard’s Reign

JUDITH
It’s a fantasy role playing board
game

CHARLES
And you get to dress up

He pulls a wizard’s hat out of the suitcase

JUDITH
Put Brezifeld’s crown back in the
suitcase

CHARLES

This is still a Fergocracy Well

GWENIVERE

CONRAD

Charles and Conrad raise their hands Gwenivere hesitantly
trails them with hers

Charles looks at Judith

CHARLES (contd)
We need four to play

Judith grabs the suitcase

JUDITH
I get to be Greygon the Luminary

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Gwenivere is now dressed as a knight She throws a card
down

GWENIVERE
I summon the power of the Moldavar
Stone

Charles is a wizard Judith an embattled warrior and Conrad
is now dressed as a peasant They each reorganize a handful
of cards in their hands

Gwenivere moves a malformed Monopoly piece across a hand-
painted game board laid out on the floor

JUDITH
I’1ll use the Bremlin Crystal to
guide me along the Dark Crescent
path

She throws a card down Once again everyone adjusts

CHARLES
I’m going to use my Dark Fog Potion
as an impenetrable death shield
through the Wan Passage

He lays a card on the board

CONRAD
Wait you can’t use Dark Fog Potion
deep in the realm of Gok

CHARLES
I possess the Aura of Light giving
me a three turn immunity to use
Dark Fog Potion in the realm of
Gok Now unless you bear the
Moltar Crescent Ring you’re going
to have to surrender youre
Twilight Powder for challenging the
Ancient Wisdom

CONRAD
Damn it

He throws down a card Charles scoops it up
CONRAD (cont’‘d)
All right I guess I’1l use the Axe
of Invincibility to open the
entrance to the Mystic Forest

He moves his piece Gwenivere jumps back and points
Conrad

GWENIVERE

Witches breath Witches breath
CONRAD

No No
GWENIVERE

He doesn’t wield the Vulture’s

He throws down his cards and points at Gwenivere

GWENIVERE
I had to protect my people

Judith delicately lays down all of her cards

Gwenivere is confused

GWENIVERE
What’s a Duel of Fate

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER

The game board has been cleared from the floor Judith and
Charles face each other in crouched attack positions
Gwenivere and Conrad sit on the sofa in silent anticipation

JUDITH
Greygon surrenders his mortal self
if unworthy to approach the Red
Wizard

CHARLES
Brezifeld accepts the challenge and
may darkness fall over the one
unfit to bear the crown of the
Mystic Realm

There’s a tense moment of silence
JUDITH
My father’s a cold-blooded killer
You don’t want any of this shit

CHARLES
What

Judith bursts forward and tackles Charles They both crash
onto the floor and begin slugging each other

They roll across the room and smash into a side table They
both scramble to their feet then throw each other into a
glass cabinet Glass explodes everywhere

Charles and Judith fall onto the floor with a shower of glass
on top of them Gwenivere is horrified

GWENIVERE
Are you two all right

They both lay on their backs slightly bloodied and totally
exhausted

CHARLES
Not really I think I might have
something penetrating my lower
back Maybe glass or a large wood
splinter of some kind

Conrad gets up

CONRAD
I’m going to bed

He leaves the room Gwenivere quickly scoots around them

GWENIVERE
I’1l get some band-aids

CHARLES
The big kind

JUDITH
And a broom please

She leaves Neither of them move Charles stares at the
ceiling and takes a deep breath

CHARLES
It feels kind of strange

JUDITH
What does

CHARLES
Vincent not being here I’ve never
had a birthday without him

JUDITH
I thought that’s what you wanted

CHARLES
I knowI did It just feels kind
of strange

A final piece of glass trickles off the cabinet

INT VINCENT’S ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - MORNING

Gwenivere opens the closet door and closely examines its
contents She pulls out a framed picture of Vincent posed in
a spandex dance outfit

She sets down the picture and steps into the closet once
again She negotiates a tall stack of books and pulls one
out from the bottom

She turns it over It’s titled “Even Edward”

INT FRANKLIN AND CLAIRE’S BEDROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - MORNING

Claire sits up from the floor She’s surrounded by shoes and
fallen clothing littered throughout the cramped closet

She turns and opens the door Franklin is sitting on the
edge of the bed staring at her He holds a stack of sealed
files in his hands

FRANKLIN
Happy anniversary

CLAIRE
How long have you been sitting
outside the closet like that

FRANKLIN

About forty-five minutes
CLAIRE

Why
FRANKLIN

I was waiting for you to get up
Waking naturally improves your
daily productivity levels by 40

CLAIRE
Is that true

FRANKLIN
I don’t know 40 sounds a little
high doesn’t it

CLAIRE
Why are you holding our stack of
highly confidential documents

FRANKLIN
If we’re going to do this I figure
we have to do it right

Claire grabs the door handle and slams the closet door back
in his face

EXT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - DAY

Judith Conrad and Charles sit around the living room each
holding a file

CONRAD
So what are these

Franklin stands at the front of the room alone

FRANKLIN
It’s everything you would ever want
to know about your birth parents
and extended blood relatives

CHARLES
For real

Judith examines her file It’s twice as thick as the others

JUDITH
Why is mine so thick

FRANKLIN
Your situation was a little more
complicated than the others

CONRAD
How did you get these

FRANKLIN
We’ve got connections

CONRAD
How do you guys have connections

FRANKLIN
It doesn’t matter What matters is
that there’s nothing left No more
secrets No more surprises No
more lies You have everything

JUDITH
What about Mom Shouldn’t she be
here
FRANKLIN
She’s locked herself in the bedroom
closet

They wait for more

FRANKLIN (cont’d)
There’s a small fraction of
friction between your mother and I
right now

CONRAD
Fraction of friction

FRANKLIN
Shut up Conrad

Conrads shoulder’s slump

FRANKLIN (cont’d)
Now you can do whatever you want
with this information You can
read it shred it or eat it for all
I care but no matter what and I
know I speak for Claire also we’1ll
support you all the way

Charles raises his hand

CHARLES
Can I ask a question

FRANKLIN
Sure

CHARLES
Where was I born

FRANKLIN
It’s all in your file Charles

CHARLES
I just want to know

FRANKLIN
Ohio

CHARLES

Like Cincinnati or

FRANKLIN
Columbus

Charles looks at everyone

CHARLES
That’s kind of cool I guess It’s
the capitalisn’t it

Conrad has already opened his file He holds a stack of
papers in his hands

CONRAD
Who’s Raging Bear

FRANKLIN
That’s your birth name

He looks at Franklin

CONRAD
I’m Indian

FRANKLIN
Half Native American yes

CONRAD
What’s the other half

FRANKLIN
Truck driver I believe

CHARLES
I cut down the family tree

The attention of the room turns to Charles

CHARLES (contd)
It was an accidentsort of It
made sense at the time If I were
to attempt to explain it would just
spin us all into a deeper web of
confusion and turmoil I just
figure since we’re getting things
off our chests right now I would
throw that on the table

FRANKLIN
Thank you Charles

CHARLES
I also broke Dr Epstein’s nose in
a fencing match yesterday Things
just got a little out of hand
There I’m done

FRANKLIN
Now that’s a little surprising but
again thank you for the honesty

CHARLES
Whewthat feels good

Conrad cautiously raises his hand

CONRAD
I have one

Everyone’s attention turns to Conrad He seems nervous

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
I take it back Nothingjust
ignore me

He lowers his hand and sheepishly leans back on the sofa

FRANKLIN
Now you can do whatever you’d
like but don’t let this reflect on
your feelings towards Claire You
have to give her some credit with
my weak gag reflex she had to
change most of your diapers

Charles and Conrad look at each other

FRANKLIN (cont’d)
And I hope this isn’t asking too
much but I would also appreciate
it if you could stick around at
least until after the party this
afternoon If not for us then for
nothing else than to create the
illusion we’re a halfway normal
family

JUDITH
You’ve got to be kidding me

Everyone’s attention turns to Judith She stands up with her
file opened

JUDITH (contd)
My mother was a prostitute

FRANKLIN
I’m afraid so Judith

JUDITH
Youre afraid so You’re JUST
afraid so Well I’m horrified

She storms out of the room

CHARLES
(quietly)
It could be worse I guess

She stomps back in with a bottle of Vodka

JUDITH
How How could it be worse Id
love to know In one weekend I’ve
gone from being the daughter of a
registered nurse and a high school
science teacher to the bastard
offspring of a KGB assassin and his
Ukrainian prostitute Only finding
out that I’m the descendant of
Satan himself could it be any
worse

CHARLES
All right I’1l agree with that

CONRAD
Vodka huh

JUDITH
Shut up

She turns to leave but stops

JUDITH (contd)
Oh and just in case it slips their
minds to mention it Grandpa has
breast cancer

She leaves the room STOMPS UPSTAIRS AND SLAMS HER BEDROOM
DOOR After another moment IT SLAMS AGAIN THEN AGAIN

Charles and Conrad stare at Franklin THE DOOR SLAMS ONE
MORE TIME

CHARLES
Breast cancer

FRANKLIN
It’s just a lump
EXT FERGUSSON HOME - DAY
Gwenivere sits on the front step reading “Even Edward” A

very Gothic drawing of some sort of troll-like creature
blankets the inside page

The front door opens Gwenivere closes the book Franklin
steps up to her side putting on a pair of driving gloves

FRANKLIN
I need go to the store and pick up
the veggie trays for the party this
afternoon Do you need anything
Liquoror a handgun

She looks up towards him

GWENIVERE
Would you mind if I come

EXT BACK PORCH - FERGUSSON HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Conrad takes a long drag on his pipe then exhales

CONRAD
I’ve always had an undeniable
attraction to tobacco

CHARLES (0S)
What’s your point

Charles sits on the patio with his unopened file sitting in
his lap He stares at the tree stretched across the
backyard

CONRAD
I’m just saying it all makes a
little more sense now

Charles picks up his file and stares at it

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Are you going to open it

After a brief moment he begins tearing it apart

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
What are you doing

CHARLES
I can barely manage one family I
don’t have the emotional capacity
to attempt to maintain another

CONRAD
Don’t you want to know who you are

Charles looks at Conrad
CHARLES
Who I am You don’t even care do
you

CONRAD
What

CHARLES
You’ve got your career Vincent has
his girlfriend and Judith has her
book What about me I’m an
hourly file clerk dateless for two
years I don’t have the attention
span to finish reading a book let
alone the focus or mental stamina
to write one This family is the
only thing I’ve got Now it’s
falling apart and you don’t even
care

CONRAD
You don’t think I care You don’t
think this whole thing’s taken it’s
toll on me This weekend’s been
hell First I find out I’m
adopted the next thing I know I’m
wrestling Gomez the Great

CHARLES
Gorilla

CONRAD
Whatever

He pulls his pipe out

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
I haven’t slept in two days I’ve
broken out in a rash all over my
back The very sight of which
makes me nauseous

He takes a step closer to Charles

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
To be completely honest I don’t
even know how I should feel
anymore I’ve gone from shock to
anger to Indian in less than 48
hours You think you’re the only
one affected by this whole thing
I’m hoping it’s the sleep
deprivation but I’m beginning to
question my own existence

(MORE)
CONRAD (cont’‘d)
So excuse my one moment of clarity
but the only thing makes sense
right now with the recent
disclosure of my true ancestry is
this pipe

Charles tosses his shredded file to the ground

CHARLES
Well I can’t do this

CONRAD
Do what I thought you wanted to
talkstick together like
Voltron

Charles stands up
CHARLES
I can’t sit here and watch us dance

around the drain like this

He grabs Conrad’s pipe and throws it into the yard

CONRAD

Damn it That’s my last one
CHARLES

Are you a part of this family or

not
Conrad thinks about it for a moment

CONRAD
I don’t know

CHARLES
Well I am and it’s about time I
started acting like it
He turns and walks towards the house
CHARLES (contd)
You can do what you want You

always do anyway

CONRAD
I care Charles

He doesn’t respond

CONRAD (cont’‘d)

CHARLES
To kill another pawn

He opens the screen door and slams it shut

He stares into the room

INT STATION WAGON - DAY

Franklin and Gwenivere sit side by side driving down the

highway

FRANKLIN
I used to take long drives a lot
when the kids were younger
Sometimes I just needed to get out
of the house and go Just drive
until they went away

GWENIVERE
They

FRANKLIN
The near-debilitating stress-
induced migraines

He takes a deep breath

FRANKLIN (contd)
Similar to the one I’m experiencing
right now

GWENIVERE
Are you all right Do you want me
to drive

FRANKLIN
No This car is the only thing I
feel like I have any control over
at this moment My marriage is
slowly disintegrating my approval
rating as a father is at rock
bottom and among other things not
listed there’s a sixty foot oak
tree laying on my house So as
long as this tunnel vision doesn’t
entirely consume me I feel pretty
comfortable behind the wheel

He looks at Gwenivere

FRANKLIN (contd)
Can I ask you a question

GWENIVERE
Sure
FRANKLIN
As an anthropologist you study
multiple aspects of societal
culture and humanity right How
people interact with one another
and in some cases the causes of
why certain societies for one
reason or another have become
extinct

GWENIVERE
There are multiple schools of
study but sure

FRANKLIN
Well then in your professional
opinion what’s your prognosis for
our family

GWENIVERE
What do you mean

FRANKLIN
Are we doomed for extinction

GWENIVERE
I’m not quite sure I’m qualified to
objectively handle that question

FRANKLIN
That’s fair I understand

GWENIVERE
Vincent and I are married

Franklin is silent for a long moment

FRANKLIN
How long A few months or

GWENIVERE
Two years

FRANKLIN
That’s about par for the course

GWENIVERE
The whole thing was spur of the
moment There’s was a Romanian
missionary visiting our territory
SO

FRANKLIN
Romanian missionary

GWENIVERE
We were married while Vincent was
traveling with me on a study of
Bakgatla tribal migration in

Botswana
FRANKLIN
Ghanzi
GWENIVERE
Actually the southwest district of
Kgatleng

Franklin thinks about it for a moment

FRANKLIN
Man is it hot in here

GWENIVERE
Yeah it could be a little cooler

He leans forward and CRANKS UP THE AIR CONDITIONER TO A
DEAFENING BLAST Gwenivere’s hair lifts backwards with the
wind

FRANKLIN
Would you mind if I had a moment to
myself right now

GWENIVERE
No go ahead

FRANKLIN
All right thanks It won’t take
long

He stares forward silently for a long moment Then out of
nowhere he begins frantically shaking the steering wheel as
if to rip it off

FRANKLIN (cont’d)
Ahhhh

Gwenivere stares forward awkwardly attempting to ignore him

FRANKLIN (contd)
This stupidI Damn DAMN IT

He grips the steering wheel tighter and begins jerking his
whole body

FRANKLIN (cont‘d)
WHY CAN’TWE JUST

He punches the steering wheel and suddenly THE AIR BAG
EXPLODES OPEN SMASHING HIM IN THE FACE

FRANKLIN (cont‘d)
AHHH

steering wheel

EXT WOODS - NEAR FERGUSSON NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON
Judith sits on a log in the middle of the woods She sprays
a small canister of lighter fluid onto a her manuscript

stacked neatly on the ground

She lights a match across the bark of the log and holds it up
to her face It blows out with a whisper of wind

CONRAD (0S)
What the hell are you doing

Conrad steps out from behind a tree holding a pellet gun
pointed at Judith

JUDITH
Where the hell did you come from
He motions the gun towards the stack of papers

CONRAD
What the hell is that

JUDITH
Why the hell are you pointing that
gun at me

Conrad hesitates

CONRAD
What’s with all the hell talk

JUDITH
I don’t know You started it

Conrad repositions the gun on his shoulder

CONRAD
I’m not going to let you burn your
book if that’s what’s going on
here

JUDITH
Just leave me alone Conrad

CONRAD
I can’t do that

JUDITH
Are you going to shoot me

CONRAD
If I have to

JUDITH
Why do you care all of a sudden

CONRAD
Is that what I’m doing Because I
have no clue

JUDITH
Why do you have a gun

CONRAD
Why do you want to burn your book

JUDITH
Because I’m not a writer all
right I don’t even know who I am
anymore

(MORE )

JUDITH (contd)
I’m only on page two of that file
of mine and so far I’m nothing but
the near sighted product of a lurid
night between a hitman and a
hooker Not necessarily the
healthiest ingredients for a
positive self-image

She lights another match Conrad quickly cocks his gun

CONRAD
Stop Damn it

She freezes A flame dances on the end of the match

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Youve worked on that book for
fifteen years and you’re just going
to throw it away because of one bad
weekend

She tosses the match to the ground

JUDITH
One bad weekend What happened to
the lifetime of deception youve
been ranting about for the past two
days

CONRAD

You should know by now that I’m
full of crap okay Half the
things that come out of my mouth
are either gross exaggerations or
just blatant lies Hell Judith
I’m not even a lawyer anymore I
was disbarred three months ago

JUDITH
What

CONRAD
I punched a man in courtkind of
in the middle of cross-examination

JUDITH
Why

CONRAD
Because I don’t know I’m just an
unhappy man with more than a few
issues that need to be worked out
JUDITH
What’s this have to do with me

CONRAD
I guess I’m trying to stop you from
making the same mistake Don’t
throw your life away on a manic
whim

Judith stares blankly at him

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Can’t you see I’m trying to help
you here Do you think I like
living out this cliched character
arc It’s killing me

JUDITH
So what now you’re playing the
concerned big brother role all of a
sudden

CONRAD
I’‘1ll admit I haven’t been the most
supportive of siblings And I’m
sure there’s a slight element of
jealousy to blame I mean you
were always the good one you know
The grades the scholarships the
overseas book tours You teach
your dog Spanish for crying out
loud Hell law school was halfway
just to keep up

He lowers the gun slightly

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
I don’t know maybe this whole
thing’s just me projecting my
repressed subconscious resentment
over the unwarranted prosecution of
my people

JUDITH
You’re not an Indian

CONRAD
I know that I’m just a guy
holding a gun trying to do
something right for once

Judith lights another match Conrad re-aims the gun
JUDITH
Put down the gun

CONRAD
I’m sorry

CONRAD FIRES THE GUN clipping Judith in the shoulder

JUDITH
AHHH

She twists off the log and falls to the ground

nicely dressed people casually moving in and out of rooms

in between two very normal unenthusiastic FIFTY SOMETHINGS

All three stare at something in front of them

RANDOLF CHANG
I attended private boarding schools
throughout most of my primary and
secondary educations West Point
was a natural fit for me Needless
to say this type of activity was
frowned upon And being the timid
spineless sorry excuse for a man
that I am I never challenged
authoritynot even for one sip

A random man steps up to two kegs sitting on the dining room
table in front of them He fills up a white plastic cup full

of beer

RANDOLF CHANG (cont’d)
But then it hit me I only have so
Many years left in this world and
I’ve tucked my tail long enough
The invitation said bring your own
drinks so I thought what the
hellit’s my turn it’s my time
I’m ponying up and bringing the
twins

The three men stare at the two kegs

FIFTY-SOMETHING 1
You went to West Point

THE DOORBELL RINGS

INT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Vincent opens the front door

Gwenivere and Franklin are standing in the doorway

Gwenivere balances three veggie trays while Franklin holds an

ice pack to his face

FRANKLIN
Why was the door locked

VINCENT
Crowd control Where have you guys
been

GWENIVERE

That’s funny I was wondering the
same thing about you

VINCENT
The party started over an hour ago

FRANKLIN
We had car trouble

GWENIVERE
Where were you Vincent

VINCENT
I was upstairs in the hallway linen
closet

GWENIVERE

For a day and a half

VINCENT
That’s where I always went when I
needed time to think

Franklin lowers the ice pack His eye is black and slightly
swollen

FRANKLIN
You mean every time you ran away as
a child you were just in the
upstairs linen closet

VINCENT
What happened to your face

Gwenivere slaps Vincent in the face

VINCENT (contd)
Ouch

GWENIVERE
You really scared me did you know
that

VINCENT
I’m sorry

GWENIVERE
Don’t ever do that again

VINCENT
Okayall right

FRANKLIN
Where’s Claire

VINCENT
She’s upstairs in your room She
won’t come out Believe me I
could’ve used the help These guys
are animals

WALTER PERCY a fair skinned character waddles up behind
Vincent

WALTER PERCY
Great party Franklin Happy
anniversary you daft schmuck
He throws the contents of his plastic cup down his throat
FRANKLIN
Did somebody bring a keg to our
anniversary party
VINCENT
Yeah I think it was the Asian guy
INT KITCHEN - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Randolf Chang proudly lifts his cup into the air

RANDOLF CHANG
Here’s to damn good times with damn
good friends

Out of nowhere Conrad crashes through the screen door into
the kitchen He knocks Randolf onto the kitchen floor and
pushes through the crowd

INT LIVING ROOM - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Conrad backs into the living room holding Judith’s manuscript
tightly to his chest

CONRAD
STOP Let’s just talk about this

Judith trails him holding the pellet gun snug against her
bleeding shoulder The crowd quickly forms a circle around
the standoff

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
All right I take it back

JUDITH
You shot me You can’t take that
back

CONRAD

It was for your own good I was
trying to help you Judith

JUDITH
Maam I would back away from him
if I were you

A kindly woman in a flower print dress backs away from
Conrad

Franklin scoots through the crowd Conrad reaches out for
him

CONRAD
Dad help me please

JUDITH
So he’s Dad now

Franklin continues by
FRANKLIN
I’m sure you two can work it out on

your own Excuse me Ron

He scoots around Ron Doddling and disappears into the crowd
JUDITH COCKS THE GUN

JUDITH
Put down the book

Conrad doesn’t move

JUDITH (contd)
Let’s not make this anymore
difficult than it all ready is

SHE FIRES A SHOT INTO A PORCELAIN LAMP It crumbles to the
floor

CONRAD
All right I‘1l do it

He slowly kneels down and puts the manuscript on the floor

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
What’s happened to grace I mean
has forgiveness completely lost its
way in the world

He notices someone in the crowd

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
Hi Mr Brinkman

MR BRINKMAN a thicker boned man sporting a thick mustache
and tie nods at Conrad

Judith waves the gun

JUDITH
Your right shoulder please

CONRAD
Can we do the left This one’s
still sore from yesterday

JUDITH
Right shoulder

Conrad turns to his side exposing his right shoulder The
crowd waits in quiet anticipation

Conrad closes his eyes and clinches his jaw

CONRAD
(singing to himself)
Glory glory hallelujah

JUDITH FIRES THE GUN Conrad is hit in the shoulder with A
SMALL BUT FLESHY THUD THE CROWD GASPS Conrad stumbles
backwards

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
AHHH DAMN IT

He falls to the floor gripping his shoulder

INT FRANKLIN AND CLAIRE’S BEDROOM - FERGUSSON HOME -
CONTINUOUS

Franklin opens the bedroom door and stares into the room

FRANKLIN
Are you all right

Claire sits on the edge of the bed wearing a wedding gown
Her hair is fried and her make-up is one large smear

CLAIRE
I think I might be having a small
breakdown

FRANKLIN
Can I come in

CLAIRE
Okay

He walks into the room and delicately sits down on the bed at
her side She picks at her dress

CLAIRE (cont’d)
I found it in the closet It still
fits

FRANKLIN
You looknice

CLAIRE
It needs to be taken out a little
in the back but overall I think it
holds upfashionably speaking

Claire notices Franklins face

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Did you get punched or something

FRANKLIN
No I had a small breakdown of my
own

CLAIRE

Really

He nods

CLAIRE (cont’d)
We’re pathetic aren’t we

FRANKLIN
Well I guess as Ron would say you
can look at our situation from two
different view points Asa
negative it’s quite obvious that
weve lost all control over our
children’s physical and emotional
well-being and it seems there’s
only a slim chance we’ll ever get
back what we once had as a family
But on the positive side after
thirty-five years we still have
each other I wouldn’t call that
pathetic

CLAIRE
No I guess not

Franklin softly pats his swollen eye

FRANKLIN
Judith shot Conrad with a pellet
gun downstairs

CLAIRE
Yeah I heard it

Franklin looks at Claire

FRANKLIN
You know you and I have traveled a
lot of miles in this journey
together We’ve been over a lot of
potholes and through a lot of
detours But if we could just take
a step back and look where weve
come from and what it’s taken to
get here I think we’d realize we
still have some gas left in the
tank

CLAIRE
What are you talking about

FRANKLIN
Our marriage I’m using
symbolismor metaphors

CLAIRE
Are we the road or
FRANKLIN
I think we’re the car I don’t
know I’m making it up as I go

A POLICE SIREN ECHOES IN THE DISTANCE

CLAIRE
What’s that

Franklin gets up and looks out the window THE SIRENS GROW
LOUDER

FRANKLIN
It looks like Charlesbeing
chased by cops
Claire leans over and puts her face in her hands
FRANKLIN (cont’d)
Wait a second YeahDad’s with
him
Claire gets up
CLAIRE
I’1ll get my purse
EXT FRONT LAWN - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Charles and Wendel ride Blue to a sliding halt in the middle
of the front lawn Two cop cars pull up to the curb

Charles jumps out and holds his hands in the air
CHARLES
My fault I made a mistake I
realize that now

Two cops viciously tackle Charles to the ground

CUT TO

INT POLICE STATION - EVENING

Franklin sits in the lobby of a worn down police station A
stern COP stands behind a counter staring at him
COP
You know he could’ve killed
somebody

FRANKLIN
Excuse me

COP
I’ve dealt with these old people
before They’re fragilelike
those hand-painted eggs with the
yokes sucked out The slightest
bit of mishandling then

HE SLAPS THE DESK HARD

COP (contd)
They’re done for just like that

FRANKLIN
Well I’m relieved that didn’t
happen

COP

You know kidnapping a nursing home
resident is a serious offense

FRANKLIN
It’s his grandfather so I wouldn’t
necessarily call it kidnapping

COP
Let me explain something to you

He leans forward on the counter
COP (cont’d)
You don’t have to be a KID to be
KIDnapped

FRANKLIN
I‘1ll try to keep that in mind next
time thank you

COP 2 opens the door to a long hallway
COP 2
Mr Fergusson you can come with

me

Franklin gets up

EXT POLICE STATION PARKING LOT - EVENING

Claire still in her wedding gown paces outside the station
wagon Gwenivere Vincent and Judith stand a few feet away
watching

Charles Franklin Conrad and Wendel exit the station
Claire walks up to them

CLAIRE
So what happened Are you all
right Wendel

WENDEL
All right I feel fantastic A
good old fashioned break out a car
chaseit’s one hell of a way to
spend a Saturday night

He smacks Charles on the back
FRANKLIN
The nursing home isn’t going to
press charges again but I think
we’re wearing out our welcome

Conrad walks past Gwenivere Vincent and Judith rubbing his
bandaged right shoulder

CONRAD
Let’s just go home

Franklin turns to Claire

FRANKLIN
I guess we should get Dad back

Everyone but Gwenivere begins walking towards the station
wagon

GWENIVERE
You know you’re all idiots

They continue walking

CONRAD
Tell us something we don’t know

GWENIVERE
All right You’re all pathetic
self-absorbed whiney bastards

They all stop and turn around

VINCENT
Gwen

GWENIVERE
Don’t you see what you’ve got here
Do you know how many people would
kill for what you have

CONRAD
What

GWENIVERE
Family

They all stare at her blankly

GWENIVERE (contd)
So you’re all adopted And you’re
half Indian And youre half
prostitute What does it matter

Vincent looks around

VINCENT
Wait what did I miss

GWENIVERE
You don’t know how good you’ve got
it You want unfortunate You
want dysfunctional My parents are
borderline certifiable My mom’s a
palm reading manicurist kind of a
two-for-one deal My dad wears
chainmail and speaks Old English
They actually wrestle each other
every night to see what side of the
bed they sleep on And with my dad
having no use of the lower half of
his body believe me it’s quite a
sight Apply these facts to the
customary duties inherent in being
parents and see what you’ve got I
need this family all right This
is the only shot I’ve got left

The group is speechless

GWENIVERE (contd)
Look at what you’ve got You have
two relatively sane parents who
would do absolutely anything for
you Sure they have their quirks
but who doesn’t
She points to Vincent

She points at Claire

She looks

She turns

GWENIVERE (contd)
Vincent you’re not crazy It was
Even Edward

VINCENT
What

GWENIVERE
It was the book Frank used to read
you Though it’s mildly
questionable why he read you such a
traumatizing bedtime story you are
partly who you are because of him
And where do you think your
compulsive tendency to retreat to
closets came from

CLAIRE
What

GWENIVERE

Judith I’1l admit I don’t know
you that well but yours is pretty
easy They rescued you from a
Ukrainian orphanage Listen I
watch my TV news magazines Do you
know what type of dark hell goes on
in places like that And if that’s
not enough I’1ll give you one word
Chernobyl You dodged a big bullet
there sister let me tell you

towards Conrad

GWENIVERE (contd)
Conrad you need to grow up and get
over yourself Sure they lied to
you Sure Claire duct taped throw
pillows to herself to convince you
she was pregnant Sure they
staged Judith’s delivery out of a
dentist office but that doesn’t
prove they were unloving parents
It proves they were passionately
dedicated to raising you to believe
you were truly a part of this
family

to Charles

She wipes mascara across her face
She looks

Gwenivere

GWENIVERE (cont’d)
And what can I say about you Your
impulsiveness and complete lack of
cause and effect thinking is
astonishing Do you know how much
damage you’ve caused this weekend
alone You were just bailed out of
jail not to mention the fact you
cut a tree down onto their house
for reasons I still don’t quite
understand The fact these two are
capable of issuing so much grace to
you is inspiring

towards Franklin and Claire

GWENIVERE (contd)
And to answer your question Frank
Yes

FRANKLIN
Yes

GWENIVERE
Matthew 1225 A house divided
against itself won’t stand You
wanted a prognosis There it is

VINCENT
Did she just quote scripture

points towards the siblings

GWENIVERE
You and Claire can’t let these guys
take you down You’ve made it
thirty-five years Are you going
to let their self-absorbed
insecurities tear apart what today
represents

Franklin and Claire don’t quite know how to answer

FRANKLIN
No

GWENIVERE
Good

She readdresses the whole group

GWENIVERE (contd)
And so here you are For better or
worse no matter what issues or
neuroses it includes you are who
you are because the care and
nurturing of these two people
right here You think you guys
have problems That’s what family
isa group of screwed up problem-
ridden individuals chosen by forces
greater than themselves to support
encourage and on occasion attempt
to love one another So whether
you believe it or not these two
are the good guys You think you
have issues Join the rest of the
world Don’t blame themblame
this twisted circus of an
existence called life

She claps her hands together

GWENIVERE (contd)
So who needs this family

She raises her hand
GWENIVERE (cont’d)

If this is still a Fergocracy

let’s take a vote
They all remain frozen for a moment
Finally Claire raises her hand followed by Franklin and
Charles After another moment Judith raises her hand as
does Vincent

All eyes turn towards Conrad

CONRAD
Yes all right

His hand shoots into the air

VINCENT
I need this family Are we
finished

GWENIVERE
No I think you should all group
hug

The hands go down

VINCENT
Group hug
Gwenivere lowers her hand

GWENIVERE
Or at least high five or something

After a brief moment Charles cautiously steps forward and
approaches Franklin and Claire He slowly raises his hand
into the air

Franklin gives him an awkward high five

CLAIRE
Come here

She bursts forward with a massive hug
CHARLES
Sorry about the treeand the
kidnapping
Claire pulls Franklin into the hug

FRANKLIN
All right okay

Vincent cautiously walks over and joins them

Conrad slowly turns to Judith and raises his hand into the
air

CONRAD
Not too hard

Judith opens her arms and wraps them around him in a awkward
embrace THEY BOTH CRINGE IN PAIN

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
It hurts so badly

She pulls him in closer HIS BACK POPS

JUDITH
I know Conrad I know

Claire and Franklin make their way over to Conrad and Judith
and they embrace with MORE GRUNTS AND GROANS

Wendel steps up to Gwenivere’s side

WENDEL
So who are you again

GWENIVERE
I’m your granddaughter-in-law

WENDEL
I wasn’t aware I had a
granddaughter-in-law

GWENIVERE
I guess there’s still a lot we all
have to learn about each other

WENDEL
I guess so

He slowly reaches up palms the top of Gwenivere’s head and
begins lightly massaging it

WENDEL (cont’d)
I guess so

CUT TO

EXT DRIVEWAY - FERGUSSSON HOME - DAY
Conrad shuts the trunk to Judith’s car

CONRAD
That’s it

The front lawn is a complete disaster Blue party trash and
a few of last night’s attendees are laid out across the yard

Judith stands next to Claire and Franklin holding Mascot’s
dog carrier Claire holds the manuscript in her hands

CLAIRE
Are you sure you want us to have
this

JUDITH

You two should be the first to read
it You can let me know what you
think when you’re finished in a
month or two

Claire examines its massive size

JUDITH (contd)
»or three

CLAIRE
It smells like gas

JUDITH
Id keep it away from open flames
for a while

Franklin with his eye still dark and swollen raises his
hand into the air Judith gives him a high five

Conrad approaches

CONRAD
We better get going

CLAIRE
Are you going to be okay

CONRAD
Why

Claire and Franklin just stare at him He looks at Judith

CONRAD (cont’‘d)
You told them

Judith shrugs

CLAIRE
Do you need any money
CONRAD
How much is self-worth going for

nowadays
Franklin steps forward and hugs him

FRANKLIN
We’re here for you son

He pats Conrad on the back Conrad cringes in pain

CONRAD
Thanks Dadthanks

Judith sets Mascot in the backseat HE BARKS VICIOUSLY

JUDITH
Callese y sube al coche

Conrad steps around to the passenger side and gets in
Judith gets in the driver’s side and starts the car

JUDITH (contd)
Well see you next time around

Franklin leans forward and smacks the roof of the car

FRANKLIN
Next timefly

CONRAD
Damn right

Judith hits the gas in reverse Conrad is thrown forward
He catches himself on the dash The car backs into the
street then takes off down the road

Vincent and Gwenivere walk up to Franklin and Claire

VINCENT
Do you guys need any help cleaning
up the house before we leave

A limp Randolf Chang drops from a tree onto the front lawn
behind them

CLAIRE
Charles is going to stick around a
while and help out

CUT TO

Charles is in the backyard with the chain saw pinned to the
ground He pulls the chord back THE CHAIN SAW SPUTTERS
but dies He does it again with the same results

CHARLES
Pleaseplease

He tries once againnothing
BACK TO SCENE

Gwenivere reaches into her bag pulls out a photo album and
hands it to Claire

GWENIVERE
We wanted to give this to you
before we left

CLAIRE
What’s this

GWENIVERE
It’s a few of our wedding photos
We thought you might want to have
them

Claire thumbs through a few pages Most of the pictures have
a hazy dirt covered glow to them
CLAIRE
They’re slightly obscured from the
sand storm that swept through
halfway into the ceremony

Claire steps up to Gwenivere and hugs her

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Welcome to our family

She squeezes tighter

GWENIVERE
(cringing)
Thank you

Vincent nervously addresses Franklin

VINCENT
I’m sorry about the whole “not
telling you I was married for two
years” thing I don’t really have
a good excuse I think there’s
actually a word for it

FRANKLIN
Selfish

GWENIVERE
Spineless

Claire releases Gwenivere

CLAIRE
Inconsiderate

VINCENT
We should go

Vincent gets in the car and starts it up Gwenivere
and shuts her door
INT VINCENT’S CAR - FERGUSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS
Vincent latches his seat belt
GWENIVERE
(quietly)
So I guess well wait to tell

them

Vincent looks at Gwenivere

follows

VINCENT
(quietly)
That we’re having a baby
She nods

Vincent turns and looks at Franklin and Claire standing
outside the car They wave

He looks back to Gwenivere
VINCENT (contd)
A few more months won’t hurt

anything right

He shifts the car into gear and pulls out of the driveway

EXT DRIVEWAY - FERGUSSSON HOME - CONTINUOUS

Franklin and Claire watch as their car disappears out of
sight

FRANKLIN
So

CLAIRE
So

FRANKLIN

Was that hunky dory

CLAIRE
I’m not quite sure what that was

She looks down and picks up the family portrait with pellet
holes shot through it

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Maybe we should schedule another
sit down with Ron next week

FRANKLIN
I think that might be a good idea

THE CHAIN SAW ROARS TO LIFE BEHIND THE HOUSE

CHARLES (0S)
WOOHOO HERE WE GO

They both look up and stare forward in deep thought

CLAIRE
Do you think there’s anything left
in one of those two kegs

Franklin thinks about it for a moment He looks at Claire
with an exhausted beaten gaze then cracks a labored grin

CUT TO BLACK
