FERRIS is in his thirties Neither shaven nor unshaven
He could be a Madrassa student an Islamic convert but
isn’t He’s been in the desert too long In his own

We pulled out of Vietnam and a
million people who had believed in
us were murdered Was that really
giving peace a chance Or were we
just being selfish pricks who
couldnt be bothered

You come very highly recommended

I’m so sorry I didn’t know they

served beer here

It is no problem He is not a
Muslim He can do as he likes

FERRIS
That’s very generous of you

Sadiki isn’t sure Ferris isn’t having him on but
nonetheless produces a sheaf of photographs turns the

FERRIS
This is more like it
SADIKI
(hoping it’s not
true)
You want your bank to look like a
mosque
FERRIS
Mosque-like -- yes -- since our

building site is in Sharjah and we
want to be respectful of the
Islamic character of the
neighborhood

And we know this Omar Sadiki hates Scanlon and hates
the idea of working for an American company -- but also
that he will do it

FERRIS
We can go there after lunch I
could show you the site If you’d
like to see it

Sadiki is either playing hard to get or truly is
uncomfortable running around town with the infidel
Ferris takes him into his confidence --

FERRIS hopes his poker face is straight enough Sadiki
and Al-Masri must have hit it off and run off afterwards
to a club after all of Sadiki’s pious bullshit but
how on earth he wonders does Hani have the photo

The question I ask myself is what
are they doing together apart
from the obvious Is this Sadiki
more than he claims to be He
travels a lot building mosques
and shopping malls At the least
Id say he’s worth examination

is possible

waits the TAXI DRIVER calmly smoking a cigarette

FERRIS gets out takes a deep breath listens to the
neighborhood sounds children mothers radios birds
He glances back at the rear-side window of the BMW but
all he sees in the black tint is his own reflection

He crosses to the Mercedes The taxi driver who looks
like a gangster lifts the back seat revealing a space

once a small town

him away from the car telling him --

darting to the few places someone could be hiding He
reaches a particular rubble wall Looks behind it
Kneels down As Ferris watches the Driver stands back
up with a Nike sports bag -- of all things -- in his
hand

FERRIS
(in Arabic)
What’s that

The Driver crosses back to his cab without answering
throws the bag onto the front seat and points off

DRIVER
(in Arabic)
You go there She’s there

Ferris looks to where he’s pointing but there’s nothing

to see there -- or anywhere -- but endless desert

But the Driver has given enough instructions Climbs
into his car Drives away

Ferris watches the car drive off looks back to where the
Driver pointed and begins to walk “there”

EXT DESERT - DAY 196

Ferris sits alone in the middle of an absolutely flat
plain Nothing in sight in any direction He glances
off in the general direction of a faint sound and sees in
the far distance through heat waves

A small cloud of roiling dust with a black center that
could be a rider on a black horse Gradually as it
comes closer he can discern it’s actually a car leading
three other cars speeding toward him across the hardpan

He pulls a rock closer to him and smashes his phone
against it Takes out the SIM card with its store of
numbers covers it with sand tosses the phone away He
looks up into the sky shielding his eyes to the bright
sun hoping to see a metallic glint -- a Predator -- but
sees nothing there He stands And like a condemned
man lights a last cigarette as he waits for the arrival
of his kidnappers

belongings and wallet are sorted through His watch is
put on a skinny wrist His MATCHBOX is shaken The
tablet is turned over in fingers

Ferris -- we assume it’s Ferris -- there’s a black cloth
sack over his head -- sits on a cot -- the only
“furniture” in the room -- hands still duct-taped behind
him His head turns to the sound of a door opening and
someone -- more than one -- lift him from the cot and
lead him out

Ferris now sitting on a wooden chair without which the
room would be bare He hears the door open someone walk
in set something down He feels a hand near his neck
and flinches slightly but it’s only taking the sack from
his head from behind

As the cloth comes off Ferris sees this tableaux in
front of him

A small wooden table Wash basin hand-towel soap
plastic Bic razor Standing next to the table looking
rather more wary of Ferris than Ferris is of him an Arab
man wearing a little white cap and traditional dress
like an ATTENDANT at a bathhouse

Behind that in the shadows stand several men

One of the men comes forward with another chair
Positions it and sits One of the other men looks in the
camera eyepiece and like every cameraman in the world
has to fool with the set dressing gesturing to the man
in the chair to move it one inch to the right

the time for it has come Al-Saleem calmly walks away
back the way he came around the light stands and cords
and out the door Ferris’ eyes shift to the blinking red
light on the camera Then behind it to the men getting
ready in the shadows -- gathering up their beheading
knives putting on their black knit masks And then they
come

Ferris who isn’t cuffed goes for the closest one
digging his thumbs into the man’s eyes but is quickly
set upon by the others who knock him to the floor and in
a violent blur punch and kick him to within an inch of
unconsciousness a horrific beating

Now they cinch his hands behind his back with nylon
cuffs Lift him up and sit him on the chair Line up
behind him posed with their knives for the camera One

Watches Aisha attending to patients Helping people who
need help Something he’s never really done He thinks
about going over there to talk to her Then doesn’t
Walks away

EXT AMMAN STREET MARKET —- DAY 210B
A vendor puts some konafa pastry the same kind Ferris
brought to Aisha’s apartment when he had dinner there in

the same kind of box

HANI (0S)
For you or for a friend

Ferris sees Hani picking through fruit at another stall
not looking at him like he’s talking to himself --

HANT
Because if they’re for someone
important -- and I have a feeling
they are -- I should show you

where you can get better ones

FERRIS
These will do

Ferris pays for the pastry walks over to Hani and
watches him carefully select fruit
