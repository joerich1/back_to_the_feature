package but instead takes the one beside it

The Darren reads EXPIRATION DATE - July 2 before tossing
them in the bucket They land with a thud and the Darren
continues on his way

Back to SAUSAGE AISLE

FRANK
Wow That’s fucked up about Bill

all the rules So weird that the
gods didn’t choose them huh

BARRY
Were not supposed to understand
the will of the gods Frank They
work in mysterious ways I mean
take for example my body type Ya
know that one one assumes that the
gods must have some excellent
reason for giving me such a
laughable thick body shape or
else my existence on this shelf is
just its just some sort of cruel
joke and that cant be the case
because that would be you know
heartbreakingly sad

CARL
Exactly Barry The Gods have a
master plan And part of that plan
is for the three of us to go to the
Great Beyond and slide up in some b-
b-buns

FRANK
I’m sure youre right but I just
wish there was some proof

CARL
Proof Proof is for pussies All

A KNIFE SLAMS DOWN and the Tomatos mid-section is SLICED in

grating the cheese who screams out in pain The grated cheese
falls into the bowl of tortilla chips

tortilla chips inside closes the door then hits start The
cheese begins to melt and screams of pain and terror fill the
air

A BOTTLE OF WINE is lobotomized bacon is fried in a pan a

a bag of BABY CARROTS and DUMPS them into a larger bowl Two
of the Baby Carrots miss the bowl and THUD onto the kitchen
counter

BABY CARROT

They start bolting away from Camille Toh

FROM Camille Toh’s POV We see everything is completely
normal From her perspective the two Baby Carrots simply
roll naturally towards the edge of the counter

CAMILLE TOH

She picks up two Baby Carrots and POPS THEM into her MOUTH
BACK TO THE FOODS PERSPECTIVE

EXT AISLE TWO - SUMMIT - CONTINUOUS

os The gang climb up over the parapet to the top of the shelves
Ne and see a wall of jungle in front of them

The gang make their way through the jungle as Lavash and
Sammy argue

LAVASH
210 First you come into our aisle and 210
occupy more and more shelf space
You even have settlements now on
the west shelf that you claim as
your own

SAMMY BAGEL
211 Geez what do you want from me It’s 211
not our fault we needed a homeland
The German products kicked us out
of every aisle in for god’s sake
We were displaced

LAVASH
212 Don’t you talk to me about 212
displacement My good friend
Tabouli was ousted from his shelf
just to make room for that braided
idiot Challah

216A

217A

Blue (mmddyyyy) 30

SAMMY BAGEL
Hey listen cocksucker That idiot 213
happens to be my brother-in-law
You know he may be a little
braided but he’s made my sister
very happy

LAVASH
Well if you ask me you your 214
idiot brother-in-law and the whole
side of your aisle shouldn’t even
exist

SAMMY BAGEL

(to Frank and Brenda)
Wow Frank Brenda come on are you 215
guys gonna weigh in here I mean
whose side are you on You know
this isn’t just about me I mean
first they come for the bagels
but

FRANK
I don’t know isn’t there room for 216
both of you in your aisle

Sammy and Lavash both laugh

FRANK (CONTD)
(to Brenda)
I was being serious 216A

Sammy and Lavash continue laughing hard Frank walks away and
emerges out of the foliage on the other side of the shelf
top

FRANK (CONTD)
Holy Shit 217

They take in a panoramic view of the store’s vast landscape
It’s a complicated unorthodox layout for a supermarket --
more of a labyrinth design with numerous different aisles
filled with thousands of different products

On the far side of the store - AISLE 20 SausagesBuns
BRENDA
Holy fuck sticks We are really far 217A
from home

SAMMY
217B

Blue (mmddyyyy) 31

Youre right we should establish a 217B
base camp here and reserve our
strength before our descent

tomorrow

LAVASH
Ech you are even weaker than the 217C
bun

Frank then notices the liquor aisle

FRANK
(whispering to himself)
The liquor aisle Firewater 224

Frank gets an idea

FRANK (CONTD)
You know from here it seems like 225
our best route is probably to go
through the liquor aisle

BRENDA
That kind of seems out of the way 225A
Are you sure
FRANK
Yeah Trust me 225B
Frank and Brenda smile at each other sweetly 240

The group begins their descent Lavash stands alone on the
summit He peers down to make sure nobody is looking at him
then opens up one of his folds and looks inside- we see he
has MOLD in his inner flaps

LAVASH

Curses The mold 226
BRENDA

You coming Or you too weak to 227

finish shithead
Lavash quickly closes his flaps and looks down at the group

LAVASH
In my aisle you would be thrashed 228
for such talk

Lavash joins them on their descent

SAMMY BAGEL
Over on my side of the aisle we are 229

quite liberal

Heres a fact I’m actually quite
proud of we were the first to
integrate dark pumpernickel into

8911 DTR - DOUCHE AND THE RATS
INT BACK ROOM - DUMPSTER — CONTINUOUS

We open on a vast dimly lit room where Douche is surrounded
by garbage

DOUCHE
Refuse of the gods Disgusting 230
(beat)
But I suppose that’s all I am 231
now Refuse Waste
(beat)
I did everything right I played by 232

the rules Now look where it’s got
me That cursed sausage has robbed
me of my purpose

He winces in pain and clutches his hole Douche then hears
the sound of something quickly whip by He tries to place the
sound but cant

DOUCHE (CONTD)
Who goes there 233

Something else goes whizzing by in the shadows Douche whips
around frantically searching for the source

Two beady red eyes appear behind Douche from a dark corner of
the dumpster Douche hears some frightening growls and turns
around

RAT (POV) The rat charges at Douche who throws a dead
product at it temporarily slowing him down Douche makes a
run for the lid of the dumpster The rat sees Douche
struggling to lift the lid and charges at him

DOUCHE (CONTD)
AHHH 234

Just as the rat tries to bite down on him he jumps
EXT BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Douche SLAMS onto the hard concrete He gets up and looks

around the room The rat scampers out of the dumpster toward
him

Blue (mmddyyyy) 33

DOUCHE (CONT’D)
Stay back stay Stay back 235
please

Douche looks up to see three sets of red eyes pop up in the
darkness under the lid of the dumpster More and more eyes

appear until suddenly an entire herd of rats come scurrying
out of the dumpster and head towards Douche

The snarling rats slowly surround Douche Douche looks
around - there is no escape

DOUCHE (CONTD)
Very well then Have at me Have 236
at mell

The rats run past Douche toward something off screen Douche
is pissed

DOUCHE (CONT’D)
Oh great I’m not even worthy of 237
killing

Douche hangs his head He then hears a loud SNAP and
squeaking There is a squeaky-voiced piece of CHEESE being
used as bait inches away from the rats snapping jaws The
other rats hungrily circle the trap

Douche watches from a distance as the rats lick the cheese

CHEESE
(french accent)
Ehhhh no no What is de meaning 238
of dis Dis is a sick joke De
gods put me in dis trap No no
no

The Cheese spots Douche across the room We pan over dozens
of rats to see Douche hiding between some boxes

CHEESE (CONTD)
Oh sank fucking god You gotta get 239
me outta ‘ere buddy

Cheese POV the rat licks him

CHEESE (CONTD)
Don’t just stand zere like a 240
idiot Get me de fuck out of ‘ere

A rat runs past Douche pushing him forward and away from his
hiding spot between the boxes He starts marching towards the
cheese forcefully shoving rats out of his way

DOUCHE
Clear the way 241

He makes his way to the trap shoving the remaining rats out
of the way

CHEESE
Oh buddy 242

He grabs the cheese and tears him from the trap leaving a
small piece behind

CHEESE (CONTD)
AAHHHHH My fucking dick 243

The rats feast on Cheeses groin that was left in the trap
then scurry away

CHEESE (CONTD)
Oh non Now zey’re eating my 244
fucking dick But I can’t stop
watching Because it’s my dick I’m
sickly fascinated by it NO

A rat sniffs at Cheese Douche pulls Cheese away from it and
notices that the rats move when he moves Cheese as if under a
spell

CHEESE (CONT’D)
Ahh hey zey’re buddy whad yo- 245

DOUCHE
Hmmmmm 246

Douche holds cheese high above his head and notices the rats
are transfixed on it

Douche moves cheese from side to side and the rats follow it

DOUCHE (CONT’D)
I see hmmm 247

The rats are moving their heads in a circular motion and from
their POV we can see cheese is being moved similarly

CHEESE
Hey hey buddy what ze fuck you 248
doing

DOUCHE
They want you 249

Douche cocks his arm back

CHEESE
You sick fuck Non Ahhh ohhh 250

Douche tosses Cheese into the audience of rats and they
devour him as he screams in agony

CHEESE (CONTD)
Ahh my eyeball ohh my tongue 251
ohhh ahhhhhh

Douche watches the Cheese get eaten There is a quick
Kubrickesque flash where he sees Frank in place of Cheese

Slow PUSH IN on Douche as the wheels start turning
DOUCHE
Hahaha yes You kill that which 252
inhabits this place

Rats encircle Douche and they purr as he gently strokes them

DOUCHE (CONTD)

And you like me Even though my 253
flower tab is gone I’m still good
to you

A tiny squeak comes from behind him

Douche turns to see a rat is still caught in the trap He
lifts the bar and sets it free

DOUCHE (CONT’D)

Such beautiful savagery 254
(pokes the rats damaged
nose)

I shall call you Dangles 255

Douche gently caresses Dangle’s crooked nose

DOUCHE (CONT’D)
YES I will provide for you And 256
you You will destroy for me

Douche turns to address the audience of rats

DOUCHE (CONTD)
Follow me hounds of hell 257

Douche hops down into the group of rats and they gather
behind him as he walks towards the exit

DOUCHE (CONTD)
For tonight you dine on sausage 258
(maniacal laughter) 259

Blue (mmddyyyy) 36

Were back in the supermarket and we see the double doors to
the back room push open Douche emerges riding on top of the
rats laughing maniacally

second to catch his breath then runs off again

BARRY (CONTD)

Barry pauses for a moment behind a used needle and watches
the person walk by Something close by catches his eye

nearby park bench

BARRY (CONTD)

living anymore I might as well

Barry slumps to the ground in despair He rocks back and
forth crying

THE DRUGGIE walks up to the bench and places a SHOPWELL’S Bag
on the ground next to Barry Barry looks up at The Druggie as
he casually pays for drugs

DEALER

DIRTY OLD SHOPWELLS BAG with him

BARRY (CONTD)

Barry runs after the Druggie and manages to leap and grab
onto his shoe lace The Druggie shuts the car door leaving
Barry dangling on the outside who holds on for dear life as
the car speeds away

Frank notices a CRACK IN THE SHELF with some light emanating
from it We hear the CACKAW

He then looks around for Brenda but there’s now a CROWD

spot her
FRANK (CONTD)

The gang rounds the corner and enter the Mexican section It
has the feeling of an impoverished Mexican village All the
products are timid and wary of their presence

SAMMY BAGEL
This aisle smells funny 320

Tequila leads them towards a large TACO DISPLAY TOWER where a
crowd is gathering A group of TACO SHELLS is being forced to
the edge of the tower by EL GUACO (a ruthless guacamole
gangster)

EL GUACO
Amigos Come Gather around me 321
These Taco Shells have some
problemos with El Guacos reign of
terror

Brenda inches forward with a concerned look on her face

EL GUACO (CONT’D)
Whhhaaat How loco They refuse to 322
pledge allegiance to the infamous
El Guaco and kiss the hand that so
readily caresses their faces

El Guaco pulls an old MADRE TACO from TERESA (beautiful
young Taco shell) and knocks her to the ground

MADRE TACO

El Guaco slams his foot down breaking Madre Taco’s spine

Madre Taco falls off of the display and smashes onto the
ground The crowd gasps El Guaco grabs Teresa and drags her
to the edge of the tower Murmurs erupt from the crowd
Teresa falls to her knees crying

BRENDA

5916 FTB - FRANK MEETS FIREWATER

INT BETWEEN THE SHELVES - MOMENTS LATER

Frank walks towards an orange light glowing from a crack in
the shelves He enters the cave to find Firewater (old wise
Native American shaman) sitting in front of a roaring fire
Indian drumming and chanting fills the room

FIREWATER 336
Hiya-how-are-ya Hiya-how-are-ya
Hiya-how-are-ya Hiya-how-are-ya
Hiya-how-are-ya Hiya-how-are-ya

FRANK
Heya how are you Um I’m Frank I 337
was told that you might have some
answers
FIREWATER
Answers I have but first 338

Firewater reaches over to a roll-on deodorant playing the
drums and runs his hand over the top of him He throws the
liquid onto the fire and it roars

FIREWATER (CONT’D)

I must know the question 339
FRANK
Question Okay Well um before I 340

saw him jump to his death Honey
Mustard said that the Great Beyond
is bullshit and the Gods are
monsters So I guess that got me
thinking what really happens in
the Great Beyond Like what’s the
deal there

Firewater is struck by the question As he ponders he grabs
his Kazoo fills it and starts smoking it like a pipe

FIREWATER
To find that which you seek all 341
you must do is look deep into my
bag of wonderment

Firewater presents a VELVET CROWN ROYAL BAG

ee

FRANK
342 Whoaaaaa 342

Frank slowly inches his face towards the bag

FRANK (CONTD)

343 I dont see anything 343

Frank goes deeper

FIREWATER (CONT’D)
345 You know while your at it why 345

the bag like that

FRANK
346 Just say when I’m just going to 346

cinches the bag over Frank’s head EVERYTHING GOES BLACK

Blue (mmddyyyy) 44

FIREWATER (0S)
Ugh he’s right Take off the bag 354
of wonderment

The bag is lifted off of Frank’s head and we finally get a
glimpse of the voices we’ve heard a Twinkie Canned Tuna
and a package of Uncle Tom’s Rice standing beside Firewater

As soon as you’re out those doors- 403

the Gods kill our asses 404
FRANK

Whatre you crazy That doesn’t 405

make any sense Why would the gods
wanna kill us That makes no sense

FIREWATER
Ahh because it makes them 406
stronger Every kill gives them
more power And it’s never enough
(holding in smoke)
They keep coming back for more
(exhales smoke)
Over the years they’ve grown
bigger stronger fatter Their
hunger is insatiable buddy I mean
fuck

FRANK
You guys are fucking nuts How much 407
of that shit have you been smoking
Too fucking much is how much

FIREWATER
We blaze for real 247 no joke 408
but we also know our shit Before
us everyone knew the awful
truth

FLASHBACK

FLASHBACK to SHOPWELLS 1954 -- In BLACK AND WHITE we see
dark foreboding shots in heavy contrast lighting of
horrified products in the aisles screaming and clawing at
themselves and passing out in horror We go wide to reveal
the store is like an insane asylum full of freaking out
patients who watch in terror as people who look more
horrific in black and white and 50s style clothing walk
around picking them up and throwing them in carts

We see Firewater watching products SCREAM and FREAK OUT

ee

Blue (mmddyyyy) 50

FIREWATER
Ococh how they screamed It was a 409
living nightmare So we the non-
perishables created a story The
story of the “Great Beyond” A
place where the Gods care for you
and all your wildest and wettest
dreams would come true

FLASHBACK to DIFFERENT cuts of Firewater and the other non-
perishables teaching the Great Beyond song to frightened
products

FIREWATER (CONTD)
(singing)
The Great Beyond the Great Beyond 410

They mime fucking in the Great Beyond and the others listen
interested and soothed

BACK TO THE CAVE

FRANK
So you‘re telling me you wrote the 411
song

FIREWATER
I can‘t take full credit I wrote 412
the music Tuna here’s my lyricist

CANNED TUNA
He brings the rhythm I bring the 413
rhymes

FIREWATER
We both drop it right and we drop 414

it all the time Boom The song had
a great hook and it caught on I
mean you know In time everyone
accepted this false truth leaving
only the four of us with the
knowledge of our true fate The
only hope we have to hold on to
is the prophecy A vision came to
me one night while I was getting
like super super super baked
Like fuck a guy baked You know
what I’m sayin’

TWO-SHOT - Frank shakes his head Twink nods
Blue (mmddyyyy) 51

FIREWATER (CONT’D)

image of our savior on the cave
wall

Firewater points to a mural with a cave drawing and on it It
it looks like Sausage standing atop an oval The sausage’s
left tip is deformed (LIKE BARRY WE NEED TO MAKE THIS MATCH
WHEN BARRY STANDS ON TOP OF THE DRUGGIES HEAD)

TWINKIE
415 I think it’s a baby carrot 415

FRANK
421 Yeah He’s got a fucked up head 421

abnormality but his head’s all
smooshed

FIREWATER

the utmost importance that you tell

Frank has trouble accepting this He’s very frustrated

FRANK
Wait that’s it You expect me to
just leave after telling me all
that What the hell am I supposed
to tell my friends Do you have
some proof or something

The Non-perishables look at each other unsure

TWINKIE

Druggie hangs his hat on the set of armor and walks to the
couch

ANGLE ON Barry clinging to the Druggies pants Barry leaps
from the Druggies pants and rolls under the coffee table
The Druggie sits on the coach and clears everything off of
his coffee table in one swoop then lays down his drug
paraphernalia He reads a set of instructions on how to do
heroin he downloaded off the internet

He tears open the baggy and sprinkles its contents onto the
table He lights a zippo and places it under a DIRTY SPOON
the contents of which begin to bubble He fills the needle
and ties off his arm

up the table He takes a few deep breathes and works up the
courage to keep moving

DRUGGIE (CONTD)

Barry looks over and spots the Shopwells bag on the table
and start to make a run for it He pauses for a moment behind
a bong then keeps on racing He runs and dives taking cover
behind an ashtray for another moment before continuing on

The Druggie puts his hands above his head and looks at them
with half-closed eyes

He brings his hands down looks at the coffee table and sees
a small sausage rolling along His eyes go wide as the
sausage suddenly starts to grow legs arms and a face and
starts walking The Druggie stares right at Barry

of the couch clutching a pillow

Frank enters the aisle He sees his distorted reflection ina
row of SHARP COOKING KNIVES and CLEAVERS

Frank slowly walks down the dark aisle mesmerized by the
foreign objects on the shelves -- POTS PANS BAKING SHEETS
COOKING UTENSILS

There is a solitary LIGHT at the end of the aisle
Transfixed Frank moves towards it He is a lone sausage
dwarfed in a sea of hard metal

Frank bumps into a knife display One knife drops down barely
missing him
