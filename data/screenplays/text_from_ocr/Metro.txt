INT BANK - DAY
A tense situation A wild-eyed white punk fuck-up of
BANK ROBBER EARL is holding a pretty young TELLER
the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple
The other bank employees are cowering on the floor A
are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-
and oozing blood from his side
Roper strolls right through the front door and walks
Earl very sociable
ROPER
Hi Earl Im Scott Roper Wanna
donut I ate the glazed but theres
a bunch of chocolate anda --
Earl swipes the donuts out of Ropers hand and starts
Roper for weapons with his free hand The other hand
has the gun poised at the young tellers head
ROPER
Im a negotiator Earl I dont carry
a weapon

Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller It

help Earl finishes patting Roper down straightens
and puts his hand around the tellers neck

EARL
Wheres the car

ROPER
I need to get something straight
first

Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on
the
floor

ROPER
Whos the manager

A balding middle-aged MAN sheepishly raises his hand

MANAGER
I am

Roper takes a step toward him

ROPER
When did you start keeping longer
hours

MANAGER
Last spring

ROPER
Really Because Ive been thinking
of moving to this branch It would
be really convenient for me --

EARL
HEY SHUT UP

Earl wags his gun against the Tellers ear
EARL
Do you want me to start killing

people

Roper holds his hand up defensively

ROPER
Its my job to see that no one gets
killed Earl Including you

EARL

Then wheres my FUCKING car
Earl is pouring sweat His gun hand is shaking
uncontrollably

ROPER
Im getting it Earl but we have to
do this the right way

Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl His voice is calm

ROPER
First I need you to point that gun
away from --
(to the teller)
Whats your name

TELLER
(voice trembling)
Debbie

ROPER
Point the gun away from Debbie

EARL
Debbies brains are going to be
splattered all over the floor if I
dont see a car in five minutes

Roper takes a long look at Earl The guy is a hair
trigger

ROPER
Alright But lets be clear about
one thing If you kill someone I
cant help you The SWAT guys will
take you out

Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside
Reflects
for a moment on the reality of the situation

EARL
What are my chances of getting out
of here

Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is
laying

ROPER
Not bad Last month a guy robbed a
bank in Daly City
Roper crouches down smiles at the blurry-eyed guard

ROPER
How ya doin

The guard groans Hes not doing very well Roper peels
back
the bloody handkerchief takes a look Winces

ROPER
(to Earl)
Cops gave him a car and he lost
them on the freeway

Earl is encouraged by that

EARL
Really

ROPER
Absolutely Bank robbers are generally
your smartest criminals

Roper looks directly into Earls eyes

ROPER
He didnt kill anybody though

Roper bends over the guard

ROPER
This is gonna hurt

He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging
him
across the floor The guard MOANS piteously

EARL
Hey leave him alone What are you
doing

Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door

ROPER
Its part of my negotiators oath
If theres an injured party and I
can help them Im duty bound by my
oath to do that You can shoot me if
you want but the next negotiator in
here is going to tell you the same
thing
Earl is unsure what to do but he guesses an oath is an

oath
He lets Roper drag the guard to the door
ROPER
Ill be right back Earl Point that
gun away from Debbie
Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the tellers
head
then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple
EXT BANK - DAY
Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits
him on
the sidewalk Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid
One of
them is Jennings
ROPER
(whispering to Jennings)
Give me your gun
(NOTE The method of disarming Earl is still to be
determined)
Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it
to
him Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his
waistband
under his shirt and vest
ROPER
I havent had to shoot anyone in
three years
JENNINGS
Why not keep the streak alive
ROPER
Because this strung-out junkie is
too stupid to get out of this without
killing somebody

Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of
head

EARL

The other hostages watch this exchange tensely
ROPER

faith is that I want Debbie

Korda takes a half step out the doorway The gloved
that is visible is not holding a weapon The other half
his body is hidden inside the doorway He wears jeans

black shirt and black Nike tennis shoes He stares
from behind the ski mask Theres no sign of fear in
him

KORDA
Are you in charge Roper

ROPER
Yep

KORDA
I want a car Like a four wheel drive
I want it in perfect condition I
want a uniformed cop to drive it up
right here I want him to leave the
engine running and walk to the end
of the street Then well come out
I dont want any remote control
devices in it I know all the tricks
If its not in perfect condition
and I mean if its even low on wiper
fluid Im going to kill somebody
and were gonna start again

Korda lets that sink in

KORDA
I want a plane waiting at the airport
Ill tell them where I want to go

McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting
his report
ROPER
(flatly)

Were going to have to take this guy

out
That draws a long silence Thats something Roper

says

SOLIS
Cant we wear him down

Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it
eyes it with dismay

ROPER

I believe theres at least one
fatality in there already The fire
alarm was probably set off by gunfire
I believe hes working alone both
from his conversation and the fact
that he wouldnt come out beyond the
doorway He was holding a gun on the
hostages while he was talking to me
His demeanor is calm and controlled
thats what really scares me The
other bad news is that he also
indicated a familiarity with our
techniques

(a beat)
So do you want to go in or wait for
him to come out

McCall calmly offers his opinion

MCCALL
Let him come out Too many unknowns
in there

Solis nods Thatll be the plan

MCCALL
When we drive up the car make sure
its at an angle about three feet
from the curb
(to SWAT Captain)
Put our best man highground Twenty

Korda goes crazy slamming the truck into the side of a
building trying to throw Roper but Roper hangs on

Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings left
SPARKS flying then smashes into BOXES CRATES

clinging on with all hes got swinging from side to
avoid the obstacles

Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES WOOD

hammers

pile BOXES WOOD PAPER DEBRIS flying everywhere

with

his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside
the

cab

In the maelstrom lets go his grip grabbing the upper

of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck
rolls

over the top of the cab landing in the bed of the
truck

along with BOXES LUMBER and TRASH

SUITCASES and
other objects he sees several long 2x4s Grabbing a
BOARD

he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift

movement stands swinging to the drivers side
driving the

2x4 through the side window through the steering
wheel

past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR
PEDAL

pinning it to the floor

As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door
