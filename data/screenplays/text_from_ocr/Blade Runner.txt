INT TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY 1
THE EYE 2

Its magnified and deeply revealed Flecks of green
and yellow in a field of milky blue Icy filaments
surround the undulating center

The eye is brown in a tiny screen On the metallic
surface below the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
etched Theres a touch-light panel across the top
and on the side of the screen a dial that registers
fluctuations of the iris

The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
on a table between two men The man talking is big
looks like an over-stuffed kid LEON it says on

his breast pocket Hes dressed in a warehousemans
uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
his lap Despite the obvious heat he looks very cool

The man facing him is lean hollow cheeked and dressed
in gray Detached and efficient he looks like a cop
or an accountant His name is HOLDEN and hes all
business except for the sweat on his face

The room is large and humid Rows of salvaged junk
are stacked neatly against the walls Two large fans
whir above their heads

LEON
Okay if I talk

Holden doesnt answer Hes centering Leons eye on
the machine
LEON
I kinda get nervous when I
take tests

HOLDEN
Dont move

LEON
Sorry

He tries not to move but finally his lips cant help
a sheepish smile

LEON
Already had IQ test this year --
but I dont think I never had a

HOLDEN
(cutting in)
Reaction time is a factor in this
so please pay attention Answer
quickly as you can

Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly
Holdens voice is cold geared to intimidate and evoke
response

HOLDEN
Youre in a desert walking along
in the sand when all of a sudden
you look down and see a

LEON
What one

It was a timid interruption hardly audible

HOLDEN
What

LEON
What desert

HOLDEN
Doesnt make any difference what
desert -- its completely
hypothetical

LEON

But how come Id be there

HOLDEN
Maybe youre fed up maybe you
want to be by yourself -- who

knows So you look down and
see a tortoise Its crawling
towards you

LEON
A tortoise Whats that

HOLDEN
Know what a turtle is

LEON
Of course

HOLDEN
Same thing

LEON

I never seen a turtle
He sees Holdens patience is wearing thin

LEON
But I understand what you mean

HOLDEN
You reach down and flip the
tortoise over on its back Leon

Keeping an eye on his subject Holden notes the dials
in the Voight-Kampff One of the needles quivers
slightly

LEON
You make these questions Mr
Holden or they write em down
for you

Disregarding the question Holden continues picking
up the pace

HOLDEN
The tortoise lays on its back
its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn
itself over But it cant Not
without your help But youre
not helping

Leons upper lip is quivering

LEON
Whatcha mean Im not helping

HOLDEN
I mean youre not helping
Why is that Leon

Leon looks shocked surprised But the needles in
the computer barely move Holden goes for the inside
of his coat But big Leon is faster His LASER BURNS
a hole the size of a nickel through Holdens stomach
Unlike a bullet a laser causes no impact It goes
through Holdens spine and comes out his back clean
as a whistle Like a rag doll he falls back off the
bench from the waist up By the time he hits the
floor big slow Leon is already walking away But he
stops turns and with a little smile of satisfaction
FIRES at the machine on the table

Theres a flash and a puff of smoke The Voight-Kampff
is hit dead center crippled but not destroyed as

Leon walks out of the room one of its lights begins

to blink faint but steady

EXT DESERT - NIGHT

The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
the end of the beginning of a day

The train that follows cuts through the night at 400
miles an hour

INT TRAIN - NIGHT

No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise its a long
insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
lighting coloured to sootheand empty except for
the passenger half way down

His eyes closed head rested against the glass Ten
years ago DECKARD might have been an athlete a
track man or a welter-weight The body looks it but
the face has seen some time -- not all of it good

INT TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT

Deckard comes down the aisle slips a coin into the
mechanism receives a beer and returns to his seat

INT TRAIN - NIGHT

Tired of the program he takes off the headset and
drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
sandwich wrapper adjusts his position and winds up
staring at his reflection in the window Runs a
hand over his face it could use a shave He leans
closer and peers through the glass

Out there in the black a sign flashes past SAN
ANGELES THREE MINUTES

EXT PLATFORM - NIGHT
The train slides in smooth as an eel and stops with-

out a sound Carrying a bag and umbrella Deckard
disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
sweltering night
INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder his
shirt already damp as he walks down the long hollow
passage under orbs of yellow light

EXT TERMINAL - NIGHT

Deckard unlocks his car and gets in Turns the ig-
nition and hits a sensor The dash console glows

and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
things off

DECKARD (VO)
It was 97 degrees in the city and
no hope of improvement Not bad
if youre a lizard But two hours
earlier I was drinking Acquavit
with an Eskimo lady in North East
Alaska Thats a tough change to
make It was so good I didnt
want to leave so I left a day
early

A little detached Deckard taps another sensor on the
panel lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
sages flash across the viewer stating date time and
caller The last one is repeated five times Deckard
sighs switches off the viewer and gets on the radio

DECKARD
Contact This is Blade Runner One
calling Com-fast 27

The SOUND OF A CHIME precedes the mechanical female
voice that answers

VOICE
Blade Runner One stand by please

A pause Followed by a husky male voice

VOICE
Deckard

DECKARD
Yah Gaff

GAFF (VOICE)
Where the hell you been

DECKARD
You know where I been I been on
vacation
GAFF
Next time you go on vacation
do me a favor let us know where
it is

DECKARD
Whats up

GAFF
Holden got hit

There is a pause That was bad news

DECKARD
Bad

GAFF
Severed spine Youd better get
in here Bryants waiting for you

DECKARD
Ill see you in a minute

The ENGINE REVS the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot

INT THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT

An enormous grey vault of a building A businesslike
Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief-
case and police ID pinned to his coat

DECKARD (VO)
I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6
The Tyrell Corporations new pride
and joy Holden was administering
the Voight-Kampff test when one
nailed him

The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks
through

DECKARD (VO)
The Nexus-6 must be fast because
Holden was as quick as they come
The report said there were six of
them Three males and three female
Led by a combat model called Roy
Batty

INT INSPECTOR BRYANTS OFFICE - NIGHT

The INSPECTOR is in his fifties The deep creases in
his face the broken capillaries in his nose say
brawler spoiler drinker but the diplomas on the
wall say something else Bryants kneeled at his safe
trying to open it Deckard it sitting on the edge of

the desk reading the print-out

DECKARD (VO)
They escaped from the colonies
two weeks ago Killed twenty-
three people and jumped a shuttle
An aerial patrol found the ship
in the desert No crew

Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
whiskey

DECKARD (VO)
Bryants got a liver problem A
couple years back he handed me a
bottle and said have a drink for
another man I been drinking
for him ever since

Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant
just poured for him

DECKARD
Six huh

BRYANT

Five Three nights ago one of
them managed to break into the
Tyrell Corporation Killed two
guards and got as far as the
Genetic Sector before he got
fried going through an electro-
field

DECKARD
What was he after

BRYANT
There wasnt much left of him
so we cant be sure But bio-
chemical data and morphology records
of the Nexus-6 were reported
missing Going on the possibility
they might try to infiltrate we
send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
tests on the new employees Guess
he found himself one

A grim pause

DECKARD
You got a machine on it yet

BRYANT
Were using Esper -- a 231 -- that
picked up Holdens alarm Its
guess is that all five are in
the city

DECKARD
Where do we start

Bryants back at the safe locking up his bottle

BRYANT
The Tyrell Corporation has a
demo model Check it out on the
Voight-Kampff Theres a chance
the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
to detect If thats the case
everybodys up shit creek

DECKARD
What was the cover on the one that
got Holden

BRYANT
Industrial refuse

DECKARD
Garbage man
Bryant nods
DECKARD
Did personnel have an address on

him

Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket
copies down a number and hands it over

DECKARD
Ill go take a look

Deckard stands and holds up his drink

DECKARD
Thanks

Like a sick boy looking out of the window Bryant
watches Deckard down the whiskey Deckard puts down
the glass and turns to leave

DECKARD (VO)
The big incentive to emigrate was
still free labor If the public
found out that their door-prizes
might kill them they might not be
so hot to go up there This was
one of the worst ones we had and
Bryant was worried He wanted to
tell me to be discrete or something
But I didnt give him a chance
EXT LEONS HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT 12

An electrical storm is brewing Deckard stands out-
side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella
as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden
downpour

INT LEONS HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 13

A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
balconies peopled with rejects from the surface world
Mato Grosso Indians in white mans clothes and other
lower echelon welfare recipients Drop city is crowded
cramped and darkly alive

Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
crowd A cloud of steam drifts up through a grating
as two old men clad in towels descend a flight of
stairs under a neon sign that says bath house

A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckards clothes as
he turns into an alcove He stops in front of a door
at says MANAGER and pushes the buzzer Its opened
y an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to

is hip Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
ich are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall
e man grabs a key from his wall hands it over and
uts the door

OHE TOR

INT LEONS HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 14

The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no

more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
outs of this establishment But Deckard finds the door
hes looking for He pauses a moment listens then
knocks He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
opens it

INT LEONS ROOM - NIGHT 15

An empty room A cot and not much else He steps in
and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs For a
place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
clean Spartan in fact The towel by the spotless
basin is perfectly folded

Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf No dust He
looks in the waste basket Wadded up candy wrappers
The bed by the window is neatly made Deckard looks
under it then runs his hands along both sides of the
mattress

The closet Theres one suit in it He pats it down
Nothing A show box on the floor He stoops takes
out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
fully traces it over the box Assured of its harm-
lessness he lifts off the lid
It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
rubber band Deckard removes them goes to the lamp
by the balcony window and turns it on

A touching collection of family snapshots The kind of
anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops
The family dog Junior on the pony squinting in the
sun Uncle Ben clowning with the kids The faded
polaroid of Christmas morning Simple pictures of
simple folks celebrating the family bond A curious
collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
them with interest

EXT STREET BELOW - NIGHT 16

Oblivious to the cloudburst a blue-eyed albino stands
in the doorway peddling candy and artificial flowers
looking like hed never been touched by the light of
day

Leon is standing behind him staring up at his room
watching Deckard at the window Hes still wearing
his coveralls but he looks different His face is
more intent smarter and angry

EXT STREET BELOW - NIGHT 17

For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash
something but suddenly he swings away and disappears
into the crowd

INT LEONS ROOM - NIGHT 18

Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the
window

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT 19

Leons got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to
match but hes a graceful runner Looks like he could
do it for days And he could Hes put a lot of alley
behind him and hes not out of breath

EXT CHINATOWN - NIGHT 20

Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto
a narrow street The Asian Quarter

INT CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT 21
A seamy as well as steamy little place Counter and
small tables Old slant-eyed enders humped over their

fuming bowls jabbering and slurping

The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
D TV on the back wall As the mellow-mouthed TV
announcer delivers the message a Latin-looking beauty
in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl flashes
a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
Choose from a variety of seventy
nine different personality types
Each and every one a loyal trouble-
free companion given to you upon
your arrival absolutely free

The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray
Bolger type gentlemans gentleman who clicks his heels
snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the
next

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
To use as personal body servant
to tireless field hand -- the
custom tailored humanoid robot
designed especially for your
needs

The Chinese are paying no attention but the man and
the woman seated at the table by the window are

The woman is pretty a touch of gray in her hair kind
and blue-eyed MARY looks like an American dream mom
right out of Father Knows Best

The man also resembles a tradition the gym instructor
short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant
but the eyes are grey and chilling ROY BATTY is a
presence of force with a lazy but acute sense of what
goes on around him

Leon has just come through the door behind them Try-
ing not to be the bull in a china shop he approaches
their table and kneels Batty doesnt bother to look
at him which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
quiet voice

BATTY
Did you get your precious things

LEON
Somebody was already there

BATTY
Police

LEON
Just a man

BATTY

Police man
Leon looks sullen

BATTY
Why dont you have a seat

Theres one next to him Leon pulls it over and sits

BATTY
Enjoy the view

From the pot on the table Mary pours tea and they sit
so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem
almost invisible The view theyre enjoying is
through the window Outside the neon side in the win-
dow directly across the street says HANNIBAL CHEW
MEMBERS

INT HANNIBAL CHEWS SHOP - NIGHT

Chew is a spindly old man of precision his veiled
eyes are shrewd and Chinese but the rest of him
looks like a Charles Dickens invention

Hes got a jewelers glass stuck in his eye lurched
over a lamp squinting at something in his hand After
a moment his lips peal back into a sour belligerent
smile

CHEW
Well youre right This little
honey has a couple of defective cones

He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
client

SEBASTIANS face is almost young but something has
gone too far too fast Premature old age has made
his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow The
house may be dark but theres a light on in it Se-
bastian is a closet genius

CHEW
Youre a regular perfectionist
Sebastian

Sebastians apologetic especially around the acerbic
Mr Chew

SEBASTIAN
Its gotta be right for my
customer

CHEW

Your customer eh

Chew snickers and beckons Sebastian follows his down
a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door Theres

a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it Chew
tugs it on and they go through The big door slams
shut behind them

INT COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
struments the room is as barren and sterile as a
morgue The glass-doored compartments in the walls
look like crypts Some of them small as post office
boxes From one of the Chew removes a vacuum packed
box Carefully separating the seal he reaches into
the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
an eye

Through the jewelers glass which he has not bothered
to remove Chew holds the eye up to the light and
studies it a moment His other hand searches through
his pockets

CHEW
You got a pocket-charger boy

Quick to accommodate Sebastian removes a pencil-like

device from a row of such things in his breast pocket

and steps closer The back of the eye is touched with
the pencil and the pupil moves Suddenly its staring

back at them

CHEW
Is that good enough for your
customer

Anxious to leave Sebastian nods Chew reseals the
eye taking his time He can afford to hes wearing
his coat

CHEW
How much is he paying you

In place of an answer Sebastian clears his throat
stares at the bag like he didnt hear

CHEW
Well when do you get paid

SEBASTIAN
Soon as I finish the job

CHEW
When might that be

SEBASTIAN
Day after tomorrow

CHEW
Oh Day after tomorrow

Sebastian nods Chew stares at the poor bastard con-
cerned in spite of himself

CHEW
The rich hate to pay Sebastian
A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting
Pay the little guy last You should
charge twice as much Itll make
him feel better

Sebastian nods his head like thats exactly what hell
do Chew sees its hopeless and hands him the bag

SEBASTIAN
Thanks Mr Chew

Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes
through quick as a dog

EXT HANNIBAL CHEWS STORE - STREET - NIGHT

Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he
came for and theres a hopeful spring to his walk as
he heads for his truck

INT SEBASTIANS AMBULANCE - NIGHT

Its an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights
The lettering on the side reads JR SEBASTIAN -
ANIMOID EXPRESS Sebastian gets in starts up the
engine and suddenly realizes hes not alone Its a
jolt that causes him to yelp

PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him and wakes up
with a yelp of her own They stare at one another for
a startled instant and she jumps out and starts walk-
ing

But shes forgotten her little beat-up overnight case
Sebastian puts the truck in gear drives next to her
and opens the door

SEBASTIAN
Hey You forgot your

He holds up the bag Hesitantly she reaches for it

SEBASTIAN
How come you were in my truck

PRIS
I was tired and didnt have any
place to go

She stares at him hand on her case looking lost
Sebastian isnt good at this but he tries

SEBASTIAN
You can get back in if you want

She cant make up her mind

SEBASTIAN
Dont worry I wont hurt you

She gets in Both of them are silent People are not
Sebastians medium -- usually hes too shy but this
girl is shyer still plus theyre about the same age --
it gives him courage

SEBASTIAN
Whats your name

PRIS
Pris

SEBASTIAN
Mines JF Sebastian

PRIS
Hi
So pleased with the way that went he forgets for a

while what comes next

SEBASTIAN
Oh Where do you want to go

She shrugs That leaves him a lot of responsibility
He throws her side-long glances but shes not helping

SEBASTIAN
You want to go home

PRIS
I dont have one

SEBASTIAN
Oh

What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
shes lost out of some Welcome to Sunny Arizona
poster

SEBASTIAN
Where are your folks

PRIS
They left

SEBASTIAN
What about friends
PRIS
I have some but I have to find
out where they are staying

She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash
Her body would win prizes from any angle

SEBASTIAN
Well where should I take you

She looks at hima shadow of enticement in her clear
blue eyes

PRIS
We scared each other pretty good
didnt we

SEBASTIAN
We sure did

She giggles and laughs

PRIS
Im hungry JF

SEBASTIAN
Ive got stuff If you wanna go
to my place

PRIS
I was hoping youd say that

Sebastians face is normally on the grey side but it
just turned red He turns on the ignition and they
pull away from the curb

INT DECKARDS CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT

Speeding along the freeway The terminal in the com-
munications console lit Deckards right hand just
finished a punch-up The screen flashes back
REQUEST

Deckard punches up Letters flash across the screen
ESPER

Screen flashes back

CLEARANCE

Deckard punches up

BLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33

Pause

Screen flashes

STAND BY

Deckards voice has been heard over the preceding

DECKARD (VO)
Machines can be helpful sometimes
but they can also be a pain in the
ass Ask for a trace on a forger
and you might wind up at a steel-
mill I dont mind a bum-steer once
in a while -- its their personalities
that usually get me Somebody once
said that man makes machines in his own
image If thats true whoever made
Esper should have been shot

ESPER
This is Esper and Im ready Go
ahead please

Espers deep melodious voice is anxious to please
oiled with a touch of self-pity

DECKARD
You equipped for random questions

ESPER
Why yes of course

DECKARD
You start

ESPER
The five in question are third
generation Nexus Sixes constructed
of skin-flesh culture selected
enogenic transfer conversion
capable of self-perpetuating
thought para-physical abilities
and developed for emigration
program Are you with me

DECKARD
How do I stop one

ESPER
Unlike a five they can sustain
massive traumas to several parts
of the body without debilitating
another Sever a leg and it will
perform quicker on the remaining leg
than the fastest man can run

DECKARD

and
Okay but

ESPER
Im coming to that Vulnerable
zone is the base of the skull
the occipital bone A direct hit
is a positive retirement

The communication is interrupted by a BELL which is
immediately followed by a stern MECHANICAL VOICE

VOICE
You are in violation of traffic
ordinance M-139 statutory freeway
limit restricted by one-hundred
and eighty kilometers

In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad
motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
of hell They draw silently alongside Deckard
presses his ID to the window

The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his
partner accelerate vanish in the night And Deckards
car does too

EXT SEBASTIANS APARTMENT

A district of silence and ruin The street is strewn
with refuse The building looks vacant A ten storey
condo gone to shit The vandals have come and gone
long ago

Sebastians little white ambulance parked at the curb
MR DEETCHUM the old Watchman sitting in the building
entry in a straight backed chair is reading a comic
book

INT SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Well stocked with items of survival all labeled and
stacked And shelved along the walls and hung from the
ceiling is a menagerie of animoids Like so many broken
toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastians wise hands

Sebastian is seated at a large work-table bent over a
stereo scope The tool in his right hand is a sensor
probe and hes using it with the delicacy of an en-
graver

The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
configuration no bigger than a thumbnail but magnified
under the scope it looks like an aerial view of a
large city The needle-like sensor probe moves care-
fully over the contours of the configuration testing
the bonds
Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures

SEBASTIAN
Oh

Pris is light on her feet Shes standing behind him
with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand

PRIS

Whatcha doin

SEBASTIAN
You scared me

But hes happy to see her

SEBASTIAN
Im working

Shes changed her dress and made up her face Looks a
little older and sexier

SEBASTIAN
You look better

PRIS
Just better

SEBASTIAN
Beautiful

PRIS
Thanks

He watches her as she prowls around the room looking
at this and that eating her sandwich

PRIS
And you live in this building all
by yourself

SEBASTIAN

Yeah I live here pretty much
alone right now

Trying to make light of it
SEBASTIAN
No housing shortage around here
plenty of room for everybody

She sprawls on the couch studying him

PRIS
How old are you

He cant meet her eyes
SEBASTIAN
Twenty

PRIS
Whats your problem

Its not an easy subject His voice is barely audible

SEBASTIAN
Methuselah Syndrome

PRIS
Whats that

SEBASTIAN
My glands They grow old too fast

PRIS
Is that why youre still here

SEBASTIAN
Yes I couldnt pass the test

There is a silence He steals a glance at her

PRIS
I like you just the way you are

Under the desk he bats his knees together

SEBASTIAN
Ah you get hold of your friends

PRIS
As a matter of fact I did Theyve
got some work to do tonight but
theyre gonna come tomorrow

SEBASTIAN
Good

The implications catch up

SEBASTIAN
I can sleep on the couch

A little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
up

MOUSE
Dont let the bed bugs bite

Taking their cue from the mouse some of the more
talented animoids toot flap and wheel about

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT - NIGHT
Its dark except for the glow of the terminal A tired
Deckard sits in front of it Esper sounds like hes
been talking for hours

ESPER
Nexus designated Leon incept
date April 10th 2015 -- to be

used in military experiments to
determine how hyper metabolism
functions in deep space

Nexus designated Batty incept
data April 10th 2015 combat
model level of self-sufficiency
optimum

A long pause

ESPER
Heres something you might find
interesting They have been built
to emulate the human in every way
except in its emotional spectrum
However after a period of time
it is only logical that such a
mechanism would create its own
emotional responses hate love
fear anger envy

DECKARD
I know all that

ESPER
What about a summary then

DECKARD
I think were through for the night

Deckard starts to reach for the panel

ESPER
Mr Deckard
Hesitates
DECKARD
Yes
ESPER
Do you have something against
science
DECKARD

Not if it works

ESPER
And what in your estimation works
DECKARD
The umbrella

Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
terminal off button before Esper can respond and the
machine goes dead He sits there for a moment then
flips on the lamp Leons snap-shots are spread out
before him

INT SPINNER - DAY

A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank drops into
a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation

DECKARD (VO)
Every government that could was
racing to populate their colonial
territory But emigrants needed
incentive Over-population and
the greenhouse factor didnt seem
to be enough but owning a human
look-a-like had lots of appeal
It was big industry the competition
was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
line

EXT TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY

The spinner gently touches down The hatch drops open
and Deckard steps out

DECKARD (VO)
His claim to fame was making a
product more human than human and
sometimes the more turned out to
be a problem This wasnt just an
escaped andy who broke his owners

arm -- there were twenty-eight
people dead and the pressure was
on

INT TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY

Deckard walks up to a desk hands his ID to a guard
who checks it against a list on a screen

DECKARD (VO)
But so far theyd always managed
to keep it quiet Not to say
that once in a while there wasnt
bad publicity Some fanatic
bitching about equal rights for
andies or an occasional trade union
proclaiming it was aun-American for
automatons to take jobs away from
humans on the colony

The guard hands Deckard back his ID pushed a button
and Deckard walks away

DECKARD (VO)
But whats more American than good
old supply and demand The
Government needed them industry
made them and the church backed
them The big religious boys
said that Androids no matter how
human were objects only God
could make people Im not religious
but I was inclined to agree
Otherwise Id be out of a job

The elevator door slides open The young lady inside
would look right standing on a cliff hair blowing in
the wind looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting

RACHAEL
Hello Mr Deckard My name is
Rachael

Deckard tips his head to her and steps in
INT TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY 33

No woman can be all things to all men the Rachael comes
closer than most The only trouble is shes all busi-
ness Formidable without really trying Some beauty

is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead

INT TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY 33A

The door slides open and they continue down the corri-
dor

RACHAEL
It seems your department doesnt
believe out new unit is to the
public benefit

DECKARD
A humanoid robot is like any other
machine it can be a benefit or a
hazard If its a benefit its
not our problem

RACHAEL
But because your department cant
do an adequate job in detecting
the miniscule number at large
its a problem Correct Mr
Deckard

INT TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY 33B
They pass into a canopied air-filtered corridor
Deckard doesnt answer the question because hes looking
at the animals Small northern animals in neat en-
vironmental cages He looks at the rabbit the raccoon
and the squirrel but the owl asleep on its perch stops
him The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
off them

RACHAEL
You like our owl

Deckard nods Rachael claps her hands The owl opens
its yellow eyes and blinks at them

DECKARD
Its artificial

RACHAEL
Of course not

Hands thrust in her pockets she strides off towards
the exit without looking back

The exit is another tube Just big enough for two No
room for excess He tries to ignore her cool appraising
stare

RACHAEL
Youre in a very unique position
Mr Deckard You could affect the
future of this entire organization
according to how you work your
little test

Deckard has nothing to say

RACHAEL
Are you apprehensive

DECKARD
Why should I be

RACHAEL
For the responsibility of your
power Being a police bureaucrat
youve got more than your share

The door slides open Deckard looks down at her

DECKARD
You got it wrong girl I work
with the bureau not for them

He lets it sink in

DECKARD
My job isnt to detect
malfunctioning andies its to
eliminate them The more the
better

He walks out of the elevator first
INT INNER SANCTUM OF DR TYRELL - DAY 34

The office is dimly lit but highlights of resilience
reside in the luster of the antique furnishings like
glimmers of gold in a darkened mine Dr Tyrell is a
fragile man of power with that look of youth obtained
from steroids and surgery Dapper and trim he leans
against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
watch The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE
BREWING in the background

Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk The door in front of
Deckard and Rachael slides open They enter a vestibule
and face another door this one befitting the decor of
the office Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
they enter

RACHAEL
Mr Deckard Dr Eldon Tyrell

TYRELL
How do you do Mr Deckard Please
sit down Would you care for a cup
of coffee

DECKARD
Thanks

TYRELL
Black

DECKARD
Please

Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
cups and hands one to Deckard The congenial light in
his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth

TYRELL
Somehow I didnt expect that the
man who did the dirty work would
be the man to do the technical
work Here you are Mr Deckard

He hands Deckard a cup of coffee

TYRELL
Is this to be an empathy test

DECKARD
Yes

TYRELL
Capillary dilation of the so-called
blush response Plus fluctuation
of the pupil plus involuntary
dilation of the iris

Deckard nods

TYRELL
May I ask a personal question

DECKARD
Go ahead

TYRELL
Have you ever retired a human by
mistake

DECKARD
No

TYRELL
But in your profession that is a
risk

DECKARD

Nothing is infallible but so far
the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
foolproof

TYRELL
Like you said Mr Deckard a
machine can be a hazard The
Voight-Kampff scale is a machine
isnt it

DECKARD
One that relies on human
interpretation Wheres the
subject

TYRELL
Sitting next to you

Deckard stares at Rachael then back at Tyrell Delighted
Tyrell takes a cup of coffee

Accepting the challenge Deckard opens his briefcase and
starts fishing out the apparatus

THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF 35

with light the pupil contracting

The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to

RACHAEL

DECKARD
Youre given a calfskin wallet

RACHAEL
I wouldnt accept it Also Id
report the person who gave it to
me to the police

DECKARD
You have a little boy He shows
you his butterfly collection plus
the killing jar

gauges register but not so far

RACHAEL
Id take him to the doctor

DECKARD
Youre watching TV and suddenly
you notice a wasp crawling on your
wrist

RACHAEL
Id kill it

Both needles go to red Deckard makes a note takes
sip of coffee and continues

DECKARD
In a magazine you come across a
full-page photo of a nude girl

RACHAEL
Is this testing whether Im an
android or a lesbian

DECKARD
You show the picture to your husband
He likes it and hangs it on the wall
The girl is lying on a bearskin rug

a
RACHEL
I wouldnt let him

DECKARD
Why not

RACHAEL
I should be enough for him

Deckard frowns then smiles His smile looks a little
like a grimace or the other way around

DECKARD
You become pregnant by a man who
runs off with your best friend
and you decide to get an abortion

RACHAEL
Id never get an abortion

DECKARD
Why not

RACHAEL
That would be murder Mr Deckard

DECKARD
In your opinion

RACHAEL
It would be my child

DECKARD
Sounds like you speaks from
experience

He notes the needles One goes green and the other
remains inert

DECKARD
Last question Youre watching
an old movie It shows a banquet in
progress the guests are enjoying
raw oysters

RACHAEL
Ugh

Both needles swing swiftly
DECKARD
The entree consists of boiled

dog stuffed with rice

Needles move less
DECKARD
The raw oysters are less acceptable
to you than a dish of boiled dog

Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
switches off his beam

DECKARD
Lights please
The lights come on
TYRELL
Well
DECKARD

If she is the machine works

TYRELL
The machine works She is

Rachael sits very still Except her eyes -- they go to
Tyrell and hang on He stares back at her as he speaks

TYRELL
How many questions did it take

DECKARD
Thirteen

Rachael sits rigidly in her chair as the ground crumbles
around her her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell

His voice is quiet and strong mesmerizing Shes hang-
ing by a thread

Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth

DECKARD
She didnt know

TYRELL
Memory implant She was programmed
But I think she has transcended
her conditioning I think she was
beginning to suspect

Rachael nods fixedly Careful not to let go her grasp
TYRELL
How many questions does it usually

take Mr Deckard

DECKARD
Five maybe six

Slowly carefully Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael
and turns towards Deckard who is starting to put away
his equipment

Deckard

Less of
but not

Deckard
style
Kampff

Deckard

Deckard

Rachael

TYRELL
Youre going to have to be on your
toes my friend

glances back at him

TYRELL
Its a complex problem and we
wouldnt want anything to happen
to you

a man might shrink at the end of Deckards look
Tyrell

TYRELL
For the good of all I recommend
you take Rachael with you
Considering her uniqueness Im
sure she could prove quite helpful

almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrells
He turns away and starts packing up the Voight-

DECKARD
No thanks

is ready to go

TYRELL
And how is it one man will be able
to cover so much ground

DECKARD
Discreetly

TYRELL
All pertinent information is
being fed into your departmental
computer an Esper 231 -- I
believe -- and a photo over-lay
packet is being produced

opens the door
TYRELL
Mr Deckard I think it would be

wise to reconsider my offer

sits there very pale and expressionless her

feet flat on the floor alone is the word

Trying to keep the fury out of it Deckards voice
comes out in a whisper
DECKARD
I work alone

On the last word Rachael glances up at him and Deckard
turns away The outer door slides open and he goes
through it

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT 36

As seen through the windshield from the passenger side
of a vintage Dusenberg The headlights cut through the
dark illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road A
downgrade

A sign slides by stating Caution Curves Ahead
Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left

The steady HUM of the ENGINE and the HISS of the TIRES
will remain but the location suddenly changes to

INT ROOM - NIGHT 37

A pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm The
young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug

Her back to the viewer As she bends over to vacuum
beneath the couch exposing her beautiful ass an
admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired MALE
VOICE intercedes

VOICE
Lets keep our eyes on the road
Deckard

DECKARDS VOICE
Sorry

Abruptly the VIEW FLASHES BACK TO
INT TUNNEL - NIGHT 38

The moon is up there slicing through the trees strobing
over the hood of the car The road is getting steeper
and the corners sharper Rags of mist skim by as the
Dusenberg picks up speed It is becoming a riveting
ride but the passengers mind moves elsewhere

EXT WOODS - DAY 39

Swift soft clouds overhead In the cold shine of

the icy lightthe viewer walks down an aisle of maples
and beeches their clean hard limbs deflecting the
frosty light and underfoot the crisp blue-white snow
melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich
brown earth

VOICE
Come on stay with the machine
INT TUNNEL - NIGHT 40

The Dusenberg is going faster now headlights eating

up the road Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
wheel drifts Not a pleasant sensation if you dont
like roller-coasters

The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend

Good place for a breather but the driver shifts into
high and screws on

EXT LAKE - DAY 41

Cold and gray The current running strong The nose
of a kayak points through the swells the viewer paddling
for the shore

This is cold remote country wild and untouched A sky
bluer than the Madonnas cloak The kayak banks and
the viewer steps out moving over the sandy beach
towards a little camp

VOICE
Were going to have to start the
sequence again if you dont stay
with me Deckard Concentrate

DECKARDS VOICE
How do you know Im not

VOICE
Youre not responding to the
stimulus I can see right here
Im not getting a reading

DECKARDS VOICE
Im tired of this

VOICE
Almost through

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT 42

In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
ger his specter-like face obscured by shadow but by
the glint of teeth he must have just smiled And the
passengers view snaps back to the road

Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
ing bend Large ones of a bus or a truck Blinding

The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop No room to
pass HORNS BLAST The Dusenberg brakes goes into a
broadside skid The hands of the passenger reach out
and grip the mahogany dash Brakes locked TIRES
SCREAMING skidding The Dusenberg tears through the
railing and plunges into space The last view of the
passenger is pure vertigo Silence

INT DOCTOR WHEELERS OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which

resembles a pin-ball machine Displayed under its
surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
read-outs indicating the results of the test

Deckard detached the patches from his forehead which
it a little damp but other than that he looks no
worse for wear stands up to stretch and walks over to
the doctors desk

DECKARD
So how did I do

Dr Wheeler is a thin boney man aloof but a promise
of compassion in his sunken eyes

WHEELER
Nerves of steel

DECKARD
No rust

WHEELER
I didnt say that Your motivity
rate checked out a little slower
than last time

DECKARD
Meaning

WHEELER
Meaning you dont run as fast as
you used to

Deckard starts to dress

WHEELER
During the road test

DECKARD
Yeah

WHEELER
Your mind kept wandering That
bothered me

DECKARD
Huh huh

WHEELER
Considering the nature of your
work that could be unhealthy

DECKARD
True

Wheeler studies his desk for a moment and his finger
comes down on the section illuminating Deckards simple
statistics

WHEELER
You got a birthday coming up

Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes Wheeler looks
up concerned

WHEELER
But you havent put in for
emigration

DECKARD
Nope

WHEELER

Youre going to be over the limit

DECKARD
Listen I could make you a long
list of complaints about this
fucken city but I still rather be
here than up there

WHEELER
What if you change your mind

DECKARD
Theyll change the limit before
I change my mind

WHEELER
You sure

DECKARD
Never been more sure of anything

in my life

Deckard is ready to go Looking at Wheeler a little
touched with his concern

DECKARD
Why didnt you go

WHEELER
Too old

DECKARD
But if you could

Wheeler considers it a moment smiles and shakes his head

WHEELER
My job is here

DECKARD
Me too

They shake hands and Deckard walks

the audio on the holoscope is off you might think
y
Pris isnt watching

Shes got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
nails The room is so quiet you can almost hear the
polish She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE
form above STOPS HER

It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR but so quiet
sudden and over so fast its hard to be sure She
stares at the ceiling a moment then glances at
Sebastian

On the other side of the room in his own world
Sebastian is peering into his magnifier soldering
gossamer strands with a laser

Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
quietly behind her If the animoids nestled around
the ledges of the room are capable of noticing theyd
be the only ones in the room who did

INT CORRIDOR - SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-
NOON

Pris moving smoothly past the doors some of them open
and warped offering sights and shadow and decay

INT FIRE STAIRS - SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-
NOON

The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well
Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the

hollow silence

INT THE FLOOR ABOVE SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - LATE
AFTERNOON

Shes running now down the hall stops at the apart-

ut of each other If not for the fuzz and the silence

ment directly above Sebastians and opens the door

INT APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - LATE
AFTERNOON

Mary turns her head as Pris comes in Shes sitting in

a chair The only piece of furniture in the room
Its broken and tilts at a funny angle She nods and
Pris nods back

Batty is lying on his back rolling his head slightly
from side to side like hes soothing a stiff neck

BATTY
Whats going on down there

PRIS
Hes not ready yet

BATTY
When

PRIS
Tomorrow he says

Batty nods he cant wait Pris glances at Mary and

gives a frigid little smile Pris backs out and closes

the door behind her Batty blows air through his
nostrils Like an animal

EXT DECKARDS CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT

The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk
Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckards car
as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off-

ramp curve

EXTINT CAR - STREETS - NIGHT

Moving through the dark city streets Deckard turns a
corner and guns it up a long steep hill

EXT STREET - DECKARDS APARTMENT - NIGHT

At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and

disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise

INT CORRIDOR DECKARDS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Hes coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
plastic plate and stops in front of his door Its
riddled with locks He slips a small device out of
his pocket aims it at the door and the locks unlock
the bolts slide open He walks in and kicks the door
shut behind him

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT - NIGHT

He slips on the light and crosses the front room
Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
in or is just moving out

As he enters the kitchen the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND
him causes him to whirl around fast hand snapped out
in front of him gun already in it Rachael almost got
shot But shes unruffled a little pale maybe but
direct as ever Theres a long chilly moment then
she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
floor

RACHAEL
Was that your dinner

Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods

RACHAEL
Im sorry I called and found out
you were on your way home These
were already delivered to your
department but I thought you
should have copies as soon as
possible

Shes holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
pack But its taking Deckards adrenalin time to
recede

RACHAEL
Its the Nexus information you
wanted

He takes the cassette but a man with so many locks
must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily
He doesnt even want to ask

DECKARD
Thanks

He realizes hes still got the gun aimed at her and
sticks it back in his belt and theyre left staring
at each other The situation makes awkward silence
At least for him Shes looking at him like shes
got something to say but isnt saying it

DECKARD
Is there anything else

RACHAEL
I know you think it complicates
your work but Im here to help

DECKARD
Ive already got more help than
I need
RACHAEL
I think you need more help than
youve got

He doesnt but shes not backing off

RACHAEL
Theres two reasons a man rejects
help Either because hes so good
at what he does he doesnt think
he needs it or hes so insecure
he cant admit it

DECKARD
Sounds like Im an ass-hole either
way but the answer is still no

RACHAEL
Two of us might be more effective
than one

She smiles

She lets it sink in

DECKARD
I work alone

RACHAEL
No you dont

RACHAEL

You use your equipment dont you

DECKARD
So

RACHAEL
So Im a piece of equipment
Use me

Its a strong look that passes between them -- a long

one

Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do

something about such an offer but

Deckards eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to
the floor and starts picking the food off the rug

ting it back on the plate

He bends down to help
Their heads a few inches apart

DECKARD
Thats okay Ill get it

diminishes the distance even more

but shes already done it
Something in her eyes

put-
RACHAEL
Do I make you nervous

DECKARD
Yeah

RACHAEL
Im sorry

And she is And suddenly he is too She hands him the
plate and they stand Shes looking at the floor
almost shy then she looks up and hes watching her
She says it plain and simple

RACHAEL
Its strange to suddenly realize
that what you thought was your
life is actually someone elses
fabrication

Deckard nods He feels it but doesnt know what to
do about it

DECKARD
I can imagine

RACHAEL
Can you I couldnt

These are not some of Deckards finer moments But she
doesnt seem to notice

RACHAEL
A part of me is glad I think I
feel more I dont like who I was
before

Deckard nods waits the respectable interval and is
glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen

In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks
around for a place to put the plate but things have
piled up on him in here He contemplates the refrig-
erator

DECKARD
So why do you think they were
after their records

Hes a lot more comfortable talking shop

RACHAEL
They probably want to find out
when they were made

DECKARD
Right
He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out
Shes writing something on a card

RACHAEL
I guess the date of your birth is
important if you know youre not
made to last

No way he can keep his foot out of it She looks up and
hands him the card

RACHAEL
Thats my number If you need me

She goes to the door opens it but hesitates before
going through

RACHAEL
You better get better locks --
if you want to keep me out

She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
shes talking about all kinds of locks Deckard looks
like he might ask her to stay but

RACHAEL
Good night

And shes gone

DECKARD
Night

He looks down at the number Its the back side of a
snapshot He turns it over The picture of a man
and a woman The little girl between them looks like
a six-year old Rachael

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT - NIGHT 54

Hes sitting in front of his console studying pictures
of Nexus Sixes at they appear blank-faced hairless
and unadorned on his monitor

The over-lay machine is transforming each image with
instant attributes hair moustaches teeth eye colors
age youth hats glasses etc All in rapid succession
running the gambit from ominous to beautiful

DECKARD (VO)
The possibilities were infinite
They could change their appearances
but not their future
Like she said it was short
Longevity is what they were after
The garbage man even wanted a past
Poor fuck Id check it out but
I knew she was right The market
worked on turn-over Built-in
obsolescence was the name of the
game That meant her too It
was something I didnt want to
think about

On top of the monitor theres an open can of beans with
a spoon stuck in it Deckard puts out his cigarette
and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS

DECKARD
Yeah

BRYANT
Bryant here Regarding the
rundown you requested on job
applicants Espers concluded that
the only irregular category that
Tyrells got is the entertainment
section You better get on it

DECKARD
I was just about to have my dinner

BRYANT
If you hurry youll get back
before it gets cold I gota

minutes Good luck

Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans He didnt
want them anyway He gets up and walks to the bedroom
Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor finds
his ankle laser and straps it on

It must be so theres one in the bed Thin pale
about thirteen years old eyes rolled up under her
fluttering eyelids wires attached to her forehead
lying flat on her back in Taffeys crowded little
room

Taffeys a little fella with wide hips and narrow
shoulders wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
a seal But at the moment hes not present

Theres a KNOCK at the DOOR then the SOUND of a TOILET
FLUSHING Taffey comes out of the bathroom heart
pounding under his polyester bathrobe and approaches
the door like the guilty fucker he is He looks through
the peeper

Deckard is out there holding up his ID

DECKARD
Taffey Lewis

TAFFEY
Yes

DECKARD
Can I come in

There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not

to think of a way to say no The door opens and Deckard
enters Except for the drool coming out of the corner of
her mouth and the fluttering eye-lids Venus doesnt
move a muscle

TAFFEY
Excuse my niece there Shes
studying for an exam

Deckard takes the Identikit hard copies our of his
pocket and pushing some junk out of the way fans them
out on the table

DECKARD
Id like you to take a look at
these pictures

TAFFEY
Of course

Taffey bends down really close peering at the pictures
from about two inches away

TAFFEY
You see I lost my contacts a
couple of days ago around here

DECKARD

INT THE OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Onstage four Mexican acrobats in matching metallic
jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
a human wheel From the PA system the Announcers
voice blares through the cavernous theatre

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
Lets hear it for the Hermano
Brothers

Scattered APPLAUSE Hand in hand the Hermano Brothers
bow deeply spring up and trot offstage

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
Next were gonna see a little
charmer who keeps her dancing
partner in a basket She
comes to us all the way from
exotic Casablanca Salome

The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version

of In a Persian Market as SALOME dances onstage
Shes a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
costume a couple of pounds overweight but all in

the right places She kneels ceremoniously center
stage and sets the basket down before her Carefully
removing the lid she reaches in and lifts out a four-
foot harlequin-patterned python Grinding her hips

to the music she rises holding the coiling snake out
like an offering Sounds of approval from the audience
The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer
as she weaves sensuously around the floor

INT BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

To scattered APPLAUSE HOOTS and WHISTLES Salome
flounces offstage the snake hung around her shoul-
ders looking limp and makes her way through the
narrow corridor to her dressing room Shes about
to enter when

DECKARD
Excuse me Miss Salome

She turns Deckards posture and attitude suggest hum-
ble sleazy persistence He comes closer with his
shit-eating grin

DECKARD
Id like to have a word with you
if I could

Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
-- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits

SALOME
Yeah

DECKARD
Im with the American Federation

of Variety Artists

He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting

DECKARD
Dont worry Im not here to make
you join -- thats not my department

He glances around like a guy whos not supposed to be
there

DECKARD
Im an investigator for the
Confidential Committee on Moral
Abuses

She nods taking it a little more seriously

DECKARD
Theres been reports of management
sexually abusing the artists in
this place

SALOME
I dont know nothing about it

DECKARD
You havent felt yourself to be
exploited by the management in any
way

Shes definitely puzzled

SALOME
How do you mean exploited

DECKARD
Like to get this position Did
you or were you asked to do anything
lewd or unsavory or otherwise
repulsive to your person

SALOME
Are you for real

DECKARD
Oh yeah
Youd be surprised what goes on
around here Id like to check

SALOME
What the fuck for

DECKARD
For holes

This guy might be an asshole but hes funny

SALOME

She shrugs and they go in
INT DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 64

her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table Deck-
ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights

DECKARD

SALOME
Of course hes not real You think

DECKARD
Its a good job

SALOME

Deckard nods Theres not much costume to take off but

SALOME

DECKARD

His hand reaches out to touch it As his fingers make
contact theres an electric snap He jerks his hand
back from the shock

SALOME
Jeezus

DECKARD
Sorry

SALOME

Hey Do your job but dont wreck
mine huh

She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower
Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
like hes inspecting the walls

DECKARD
They have their ways of doing
their dirty work without the
victim knowing whats going on

His eyes are moving over everything shes got

DECKARD
Youd be surprised what a guyll
go through to get a glimpse of a
beautiful body

SALOME
I bet I would

DECKARD
Little dirty holes the bastards
drill in the wall so they can
watch a lady undress

And to his amazement he actually spots one Its down
low on the wall Not a good idea to turn his back on
work but he cant resist

SALOME
And what if somebody did try to
exploit me Who do I go to

Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat
legs

DECKARD
Me

SALOME
And who do I go to about you

He looks back Shes some out of the shower dripping
nude Shes taken off her black wig Her hair is
short and blonde

Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit
He stares at her a moment too long

DECKARD
Hmmmmm

Deckard grins and she returns it

She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
body The snake noses through the cosmetics tongue
flicking trying to get back to its mistress Absently
she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs

ZHORA
You ever get the feeling things
arent the way they seem

Her hand closes around the snakes head Deckard sees
it coming but cant move fast enough She strikes him
so hard it knocks him off his feet Before he hits the
floor she kicks him in the stomach The snake whistles
through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way
It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor

He goes for his laser but shes already out the door

INT PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
a door at the other end of the hall He sprints after
her arrives at the door and flings it open Black-
ness The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the
metal steps

EXT STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
Its raining heavily

The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
fic these days A bizarre place on a Friday night
hawkers and whores the rabble the poor and the cur-
ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
lit stands Zhora in just a raincoat is not out of
place in this flea market atmosphere Trying not to
run she slices through the mob as quickly as she can
Deckard is not far behind dodging and side-stepping
trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
shelter

She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
onto a less crowded street She glances over her

shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
a couple of pedestrians All three go down

Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
ting to her feet She sees him and runs The two ped-
estrians are in his line of fire He runs past them
and drops to one knee leveling his laser

DECKARD
Stop or youre dead

She doesnt The beam flashes through the air but
shes already around the corner

With his bottom lip between his teeth it hurts to move
so fast Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
in front of the first car coming It screeches to a

stop Deckard scrambles for the door but the guy be-
hind the wheel has other ideas He peels out fast

The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
him Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
tron inside can lock it Deckards yanked it open and
jumps in She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
face The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
plasters her against the door

Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the

street Its long and its empty and its going by fast

Nothing the old lady cares to see -- shes got her hands
over her eyes whimpering hoping shell faint before
she dies

Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
over As the car bounces off the curb he floors it

Zhoras a hundred yards ahead halfway down the street
trying to make it back into the crowded mall Shes
running fast but the car is faster

As he passes her Deckard hits the brakes and skids
broadside seventy feet The door flies open and he
rolls out FIRING

Zhoras ducking it with no where to go except

The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
through

ts a corner shop joined to a series of stores front-—
ng the mall Deckard runs to the opening shes made
nd pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
ora breaks through one window after another getting
liced getting shot trying to get away from Deckards
aser But she doesnt

HuUuN®DEH

His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
skull It kills her but doesnt stop her Her speed
takes whats left of her through the last two windows
and into the street where she runs into a parked car
with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
it

Hunched over breathing hard Deckard comes slowly for-
ward The crowd starting to gather Theres something
for everybody and theyre coming from all directions

Deckard moves through them edging to have a look
Its not a good thing to see It looks like Salome

and the car tries to eat each other A bloody feast
of metal and flesh
Deckard bows his head sick exhausted So much commo-
tion he doesnt notice THREE COPS closing in from
behind

COP
Drop it

Deckard has his back to them Theyre fanned out and
crouched ready to fire Deckard drops his laser Two
of them rush up spin him around while the third does a
frisk

TWO MORE COPS arrive wary and wild-eyed pushing the
people back -- his is not a good place for cops

Deckards ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking
him With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
the SERGEANT covering the action

SERGEANT
On your belly

Deckards not in the mood for it

DECKARD
Listen Sergeant

Hes reaching for his ID The Cop with the rubber
billy hits him in the head

One thrill after another Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS
The last thing Deckard hears as he falls The Cop
reaches inside Deckards coat for the concealed weapon
they missed but its an ID card He looks at it fora
moment then looks up

COP
Hey Sarge this guys a cop

An embarrassing situation

SERGEANT
Clear this fuckin crowd

The Cops start pushing And for one split second one
of the crowd looks a lot like Leon

INT OLD OPERA HOUSE - MENS ROOM - NIGHT

Your standard low class crapper Bryant is planted
firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
rubbing his face trying not to pop the clutch in his
anger This is a public place he doesnt want to
yell

BRYANT
Just because its a Nexus 6 doesnt
change procedure A little known
fact can become a well-known fact
and part of our job Deckard is
to make sure that doesnt happen
Now how can be do that if you blow
one away in front of a fuckin
audience

Its not the sort of question that expects an answer
Deckards washing his face in the basin hoping itll
all go away

BRYANT
Well

Deckard looks up dripping reaches for a paper towel
Bryant slaps one in his hand

DECKARD
She was gonna get away

BRYANT
Then let her get away I thought
you were a pro -- youre supposed

to be a fuckin tracker
Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths

BRYANT
Id say you got a little carried
away

Deckards voice is barely audible

DECKARD
I didnt like her

BRYANT
You didnt like her

He slams the handle on one of the urinals

BRYANT
You start liking or disliking
andies its time to hang it up

The PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES Theres nothing
to do but nod Deckard nods Poor bastard has had a
rough night Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
hands it to him Deckard puts it to his mouth and
Bryant watches Deckards Adams apple like hes count-
ing the swallows Deckard hands it back empty Bryant
caps it puts it back in his pocket

BRYANT
Look go home Get some rest
Take an aspirin
DECKARD
Yeah

Bryant shuffles out like an old bear
INT OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT

Cheap whiskey and bad wine Thats the kind of place
this is Its near closing But still a few at the
bar Alcoholic silhouettes

In the bg Deckard comes down the passage from the
mens room and stops at the phone He gets a number
out of his pocket and calls it As he talks he leans
against the wall his body language intimate and chummy

Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
himself

Deckard hangs up walks to the bar and straggles a
stool The BARTENDERs a big lady with tits like sand
bags and a voice that plays no favorites

BARTENDER
I cant protect your drinks
mister while you was in the
potty this hummer snatched it

Deckard glances at his stool-mate A huge MAN slumped
over the bar like a beached whale

DECKARD
No problem Gimme another

The whale doesnt move but it speaks with a gravelly
Russian accent

RUSSIAN
Forgive me I thought was free
drink I will pay

DECKARD
Forget it

But the big mans digging through his pockets Deck-
ards drink arrives and the Russian raises his head

Its a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in

his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your

heart But its Leon

LEON
I think I have no money

DECKARD
Its okay Forget it
LEON
But I would like to buy you drink

DECKARD
Ill but you one Whatll you
have

LEON
Vodka

DECKARD

Shot of vodka please

LEON
Thank you very much

DECKARD
My pleasure

Deckard brings out his smokes Offers one Leon takes
it and they light up The drinks come

LEON
Prosit

DECKARD
Prosit

Down the hatch Leon slaps his glass on the bar reach-
es into his pocket brings out a little match box and
slaps that down too Its done with such pride that
Deckard has to look

LEON
You want to see my friends

DECKARD
Sorry dont have the time

LEON
No problem

Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar

DECKARD
Those cockroaches

LEON
Ya

Deckard looks interested One of them starts to scamp-
er away but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand

DECKARD
How long you had these guys
LEON
Two months But this one is not
guy It is girl His girl

Leon leans closer like he doesnt want the cockroaches
to hear

LEON
Usually Blackie waits until Igor
is eating then when his back is
turned he tries to take advantage
of Anna

Deckard nods definitely interested He signals the
bartender for another round The drinks arrive

LEON
Prosit

DECKARD
Prosit

Down the hatch Their eyes meet at the bottom

LEON
You never saw a cockroach make
love

Deckard shakes his head but hed like to
Leon smiles slyly

LEON
We will try

Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
it on the bar They both lean down and watch intently
The drinks come and are put away but the cockroaches
are not cooperating

LEON
It must be that he is not hungry
or maybe she is not hot

Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
back in their box He holds up the last and kisses it

LEON
You like to kiss her goodbye

DECKARD
No thanks

BARTENDER
Make sure you take your girlfriends
with you when you leave
What neither of them notices is that between Leons
fingers his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh

Deckard lifts his glass it is empty

LEON
I like you

DECKARD
I like you too

LEON
One more eh

DECKARD
I gotta piss

Deckard gets on his feet leans forward like a man in
a stiff wind and stops

DECKARD
I think Ill piss outside

Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit

EXT ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Deckard reels out The door swings shut and hes sober
as hell and moving fast Around the big trash dumpster
alongside the building he plasters himself against the
wall and his gun is out aimed at the door Hes ina
good spot with a perfect line of fire Moments go by
and hes glad for the time to steady himself The
SOUND of his BREATHING the HUM of the city and the
quiet

Suddenly from behind Deckard is swept off his feet and
twirled around in Leons bear-trap embrace

Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement skidding
hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin but he rolls
out of it and comes up with gun in hand but Leon is so
fast hes already there and kicks it out of his hand

Leon moves towards him backing Deckard against the wall

LEON
How come you know where Zhora was
so quick

His hand is lightning It shoots out grabs Deckards
hair

DECKARD
I showed pictures Somebody
recognized her I went to see
Deckard is pale The sweat is starting to run

LEON
How old am I

DECKARD
I dont know

The grip tightens and twists

LEON
My birthday is April 10 2015
How long do I live

DECKARD
Four years

He lets go

LEON
More than you

Deckards knees come up fast Leons fist comes down
faster like a hammer

LEON
Painful to live in fear isnt it

Deckard is doubled over hugging his thigh

LEON
But thats how it is to be a
slave The future is sealed off
he grovels he waits

Even hurt Deckard is fast He goes for his ankle gun
but Leons got it out of his hand before he can even
raise it and throws it down the alley

Deckard hurls forward knocking him off balance and
scrambles to get away Leon grabs him by the foot
drags him back and jerks him off the ground

LEON
Sex reproduction security the
simple things But no way to
satisfy them To be homesick
with no place to go Potential
with no way to use it Lots of
little oversights in the Nexus 6

He slams Deckard into the wall

LEON
I tell you nothing is worse

than having an itch you can never
scratch

Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles
protecting his head with his arms waiting for the next
one

Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
his head pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
tion of smashing Deckards skull

The spasm that runs through Leons face is not from
satisfaction Its the bullet that went through his
neck He hits the ground hard his big teeth biting
the air like a rabid dog Dead

Rachael is standing in the alley Deckard lies there
looking at her She comes slowly and quietly forward
and drops Deckards gun by his side

Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
up but cant quite manage it He looks up at her
panting spits blood and almost smiles

DECKARD
Like I said I dont need your
help

After a long moment she bends down to touch him

RACHAEL
You look terrible you know that

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Hes lying in the tub with a drink eyes half mast
water up to his chin bruised and beat but looking
just a little wicked in his balmy luxury

DECKARD (VO)
I knew a cop once who was involved
in a high-speed chase They shot
out one of his tires and he went
over a cliff at hundred and fifty
miles an hour They found him in
the morning with a broken skull
six fractured ribs and second-
degree burns On the way to the
hospital he made a play for the
nurse

He takes a drink and clears his throat

DECKARD
Hey I thought you were supposed
to be taking care of me

RACHAELS VOICE
What do you need

He doesnt answer Lies there sipping his drink
Rachael comes in a little uncertain a little droll
and stands there looking down at him

DECKARD
Dont just stand there looking at
me Its not polite

RACHAEL
What do you want me to do

DECKARD
Sit

She sits on the edge of the tub

DECKARD
Gimme your arm

Shes wearing a short-sleeved dress Its a long del-
icate arm and Deckard holds it inspecting it like a
maestro with a Stradivarius He looks up at her

DECKARD
You ever take a bath with a man
before

RACHAEL

Theres a lot I havent done with
a man before

Hes got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
her arm Starting with her wrist and running the bar
to her elbow up and down slow and slippery She
watches not quite sure of the ritual

He pulls her closer and runs his hand up higher mould-
ing and pressing working around her flesh up and under
her arm into the privacy of her dress

RACHAEL
Youre getting me wet

Oh yes For a moment Deckard stares at her like some
furry-legged satyr in rut the fingers of his other
hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard
looks like something that was washed up in it Hes
spread out flat face creased and puffed

His eyes squint open but only for a moment His

hands are more reliable They search over the bed
but find it bare He edges his head over the side
looking around for signs but shes all gone He
gets up in two stages sits and then stands Then
sits again resting his head in his hands

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING 72

Deckards got his face in the mirror shaving it Its
been a long night Nothing a new tongue and a trans-
fusion wouldnt put right He moves a couple of inches
to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 73

Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
his knees the card with Rachaels number in his lap
and having no luck

RACHAELS VOICE
Sorry I am not in at the moment
but if youll leave your name and
number Ill return your call as
soon as I can

Thats not soon enough Deckard hangs up puts the
phone on the floor and leans back on the couch

DECKARD
Fuck you then

INT MR DEETCHUMS APARTMENT - MORNING 74

The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
wings strains from the tips of its toes crowing at
the ceiling Between crows theres a TAPPING at the
door

You might call this a barnyard apartment Theres

straw on the floor and several hens roosting against

the back wall The front door opens a few inches and
Sebastian pokes his head in

SEBASTIAN
Mr Deetchum Hello

Nobody seems to be home except his chickens As Sebas-
tian enters closing the door behind him a goose
charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking

SEBASTIAN
Now now Waddles

Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder Waddles
veers off from the attack As Sebastian crosses the
room a pig peeks out from behind the couch
SEBASTIAN
Hello Wrigley

He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs putting
them into a bowl hes brought He puts down the bowl
and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
payment and puts the money on a plate Hes about to
leave but notices theres no water in the dispenser

SEBASTIAN
Mr Deetchum isnt taking very
good care of you people

Pouring from a jug on the table he fills the dispenser

with water scatters a little grain on the floor gets
his bowel of eggs and leaves

Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
a long drink

INT CORRIDOR - SEBASTIANS FLOOR - MORNING

They glance around the room waiting for Sebastian to
pick up the ball
SEBASTIAN

He disappears into the kitchen Batty looks happy with
the way things are going

BATTY
Charming

Pris comes up close Her tone muted but demanding

PRIS
Well

Batty finds her attitude amusing which makes her even
more pugnacious

PRIS
I want to know whats going on

Theres a punitive edge to Battys response

BATTY
Theres only three of us left

Pris is shocked Her whisper comes out a hiss

PRIS
Then were stupid and well die

BATTY
Not if everybody is doing their
job here at home How are things
at home
A little spotted pig on the table sits up

PIG

They all turn and stare at the pig Batty is delighted

to be appreciated Well

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR AND ROOM - DAY 77

Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
iron lung A little above his head facing him is a
bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions

Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend

Holden has lost weight his face is grey he cant
move his head but hes smiling like the cat who ate
the canary

DECKARD
How are you doing old man

Holdens voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
that comes out of the joker at the back of the class

HOLDEN

not really great but I feel just
great How you like my new suit

DECKARD
Well you dont have to worry

widow

Holden bites his bottom

his voice but he cant

Believe me take it from an old
pro no matter how good we get

artificial anything that can

contradiction

You might as well go fuck your

Batty Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their
host Sebastian is staring back his fork halfway to
his mouth looking from face to face Although nothing
is being said hes totally comfortable as much at
home with them as he is with his animoids

BATTY
Why are you staring at us

SEBASTIAN
Youre just all so so different

Batty nods his head smiling sending home the fact and
Sebastian is certainly getting it

PRIS

BATTY
Very good Pris Now show him why

Its a command Pris is pleased to obey She sits quiet-
ly a moment hands folded in her lap prim and proper
Mary doesnt like these displays but Batty is beaming

Those hands in Pris lap suddenly move almost faster
than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
her digging into the material with such ferocity that
Sebastian jumps She plunges into the guts of the couch
up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
ing Except for the clenched teeth she is smiling like
an angel

Sebastian is riveted his eyes wide and astounded like
hes just seen the devil He laughs nervously glad
that the devil is a friend

BATTY
We have a lot in common

SEBASTIAN
You mean that you cant come here

SEBASTIAN
Yes

Pris sits up smiling Mary sighs a breath of relief
and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude

BATTY
Im sure glad you found us
Sebastian What do you think
Mary

MARY
I dont think there is another
human being in this whole world
who would have helped us

BATTY
Pris

Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him

That has a lot of impact Sebastian looks around try-
ing to keep the tears from coming

BATTY
Youre our best and only friend

SEBASTIAN
Thank you

INT DECKARDS APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY 81

Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckards
shirts her chin over the edge her eyes moving around
the room Deckard lies next to her Looking like a
man who died a voluptuous death

RACHAEL
When was the last time you cleaned
this place

DECKARD
Hmmm

RACHAEL
Have you ever cleaned your
apartment

DECKARD

Dont be fooled by appearances

RACHAEL
It appears to be dirty -- why dont
you get somebody

He rolls over to admire her legs
DECKARD
Because they would ruin the

arrangement

He kisses the back of her thigh

RACHAEL
They could clean around the
arrangement

DECKARD

I dont like people snooping around
my stuff

He kisses her other thigh gets up and goes into the
bathroom

DECKARDS VOICE
Theres a vacuum in the front room
closet is you wanna give it a try

Rachael lies there a moment then gets up and goes into
the front room and opens the closet door The vacuum is
not easy to get to but finally she wrestles it out As
she starts to plug it in --

DECKARD
Oh no dont do that

Hes wrapped in a sheet watching her from the doorway

RACHAEL
But if I dont plug it in how can
I

DECKARD

Never mind the plug just go
through the motions

RACHAEL
But then how can you

DECKARD
I dont like the noise Just
practice Practice makes perfect

She stares at him like hes nuts

DECKARD
Im serious Go ahead Show me
how you would do it

Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
thing

DECKARD
How about under the couch there
Come on

She bends over to get it Deckard pulls up a chair and
sits down with his chin in his hands She looks back
at him

RACHAEL
This feels stupid

DECKARD
Good for a smart girl to feel
stupid Part of your education
She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor Deckard
gets up and comes towards her Her eyes travel halfway
down his sheet and she leaves

RACHAEL
Youre sick Deckard

DECKARD
I never felt better

EXT TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK

Mansion and opulent grounds Sebastians humble truck
parked among richer relations including a spinner and
a 1928 Dusenberg

EXT TYRELL MANSION - DUSK

The den It contains a collection of big game trophies
and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and
proper with an egg the size of a basketball in his
lap

Old Hannibal Chew was right the rich make you wait
Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between
the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds

EXT TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK

Tyrells young WIFE sits on the diving board watching
her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT And
two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other
for their dads attention

From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the
fun then continues with a tray of mugs towards the
house

EXT PLATEAU - DUSK

And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds a
figure stands watching waiting like a bird of prey

EXT TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK

On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses Tyrell
turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom
The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of
one of the animals

He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap pro-
ceeds up the steps and into his mansion

INT TYRELL DEN - NIGHT

Next to a tray of cookies and milk Sebastian sits pa-

tiently with the egg in his lap As the door opens
he gets to his feet expectantly Its STYLES Tyrells
bodyguard He could play the Giant in Jack and The
Beanstalk

STYLES
Okay Ill take that now

Sebastian would rather put it in the bosss hands but
Styles takes it and is almost through the door when
Sebastian stops him

SEBASTIAN
Wait

He almost forgot

SEBASTIAN
Cant fly without the pilot

Sebastian hands hima little box Styles stuffs it in
his pocket and shuts the door behind him

EXT TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT

Motionless and monumental six buffalo stand like stat-
ues in the grass Suddenly they swing their shaggy
heads to watch something pass

In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious
beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion

INT TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Its a medieval-sized hall The piece de resistance is
an 18th Century English painting of an Arab stallion
gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace

The entire family is seated at the table which glitters
for the festive occasion Presents gathered around the
oldest child

Styles hands the egg to Tyrell A hush falls over
the table This is Dads big present Tyrell sets is
down before the boy

IAN is a fresh slim lad who is ten today He looks up
at his father then beaming pries open the eggs
hinged lid Tyrells hand goes to his pocket and the
griffon steps out of the shell

IAN
Oh

Basically an avian invention it has wings and plumage
the head of an eagle the body of a lion and weighs no
more than eight pounds It cranes its neck and testing

its balance stands on one leg and then hops to the
edge of the table and into the air

The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling Turn-
ing in a forty-five degree it suddenly drops into a
dive

Delighted the children shriek and scream as the griffon
swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over
the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan

Reaching the end of the room it banks sharply and
flies back towards the table cups its wings spreads
its tail and comes in for an awkward landing Theyre
laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian

IAN
Papa Did you make this

TYRELL
No We can make man but not a
griffon

He bends down and kisses his wife
TYRELL
Have to give the cottage industry
a chance too
Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den

INT TYRELL DEN - NIGHT

Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk Sebastian
hands down the invoices Tyrell glances over them and
writes out a check

He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against
the wall by the door For a fraction of a second hes
shocked but recovers fast

TYRELL
A friend of yours Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
Yes this is someone who wants to
talk to you Dr Tyrell
Batty smiles

BATTY
The name is Batty Roy Batty

TYRELL

Oh

Very slowly Tyrells hand moves towards the back side
of the desk

BATTY
To act without understanding could
lead to the very thing the act
seeks to avoid

Whats in Battys eyes completes the warning Tyrell
decides to heed it

BATTY
A little talk it all I need

Tyrell looks at Sebastian Considers consequences
Back to Batty

TYRELL
Would you like to talk in private
then
Batty thinks it over
BATTY

Yeah It might be better if we
talk in private Sebastian Why
dont you go home

TYRELL
Heres your check my boy Thank
you

SEBASTIAN

Thank you Dr Tyrell Ill see
you later

He slips out closing the door behind him Opens it
again and sticks his head it

SEBASTIAN
Was everything okay

TYRELL
Just beautiful

Hes gone

If Tyrell is scared hes doing a good job of concealing
it

TYRELL
Im surprised you didnt come to
me sooner

BATTY
Its not an easy thing to meet
your maker

TYRELL
And what can he do for you

BATTY
Can the maker repair what he makes

TYRELL
Would you like to be modified

BATTY
Had in mind something a little more
radical

TYRELL

Whats the problem

BATTY
Death

TYRELL
Im afraid thats a little out of
my

Batty cuts in with a whisper

BATTY
I want more life fucker

TYRELL
Come here
Batty walks forward
TYRELL
Sit down
Batty does
TYRELL

The facts of life Ill be blunt
To make an alteration in the
evolvement of an organic life
system at least by men makers

or not it fatal A coding sequence
cant be revised once its
established

BATTY
Why

TYRELL
Because by the second day of
incubation any cells that have
undergone reversion mutation give
rise to revertant colonies -- like
rats leaving a sinking ship The
ship sinks

BATTY
What about EMS recombination

TYRELL
Weve already tried it -- ethyl
methane sulfonate is an alkylating
agent and a potent mutagen -- it
creates a virus so lethal the
subject was destroyed before we
left the table

Batty nods grimly

BATTY
Then a repressor protein that blocks
the operating cells

TYRELL
Wouldnt obstruct replication but
it does give rise to an error in
replication so that the newly
formed DNA strand carries a
mutation and youre got a virus

again but all this is academic
-- you are made as good as we could
make you

BATTY

But not to last

TYRELL
Put it this way Rolls Royces are
made to last -- as least they were
But Im afraid youre a Ferrari
A high strung racing car -- built
to win not to last

Batty smiles bitterly

TYRELL
Also youre too valuable to
experiment with

BATTY
I am

Tyrell cant help a flash of pride

TYRELL
The bast of all possible androids
Were proud of our prodigal son --
glad youre returned Youre quite
a prize
Shoulders hunched Batty looks down an uncharacteristic
note of guilt in his voice

BATTY
Ive done some questionable things

TYRELL
Also extraordinary things

BATTY
Nothing the God of biomechanics
wouldnt let you in heaven for

They share a laugh In spite of himself theres a look
of relief in Tyrells face as Batty extends his hand
Tyrell takes it and they shake The reverence in Bat-
tys eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile The smile
turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
crack Before the scream comes out of his mouth Batty
stifles it

Tyrell claws at the iron fingers but theyre sinking
into his face Placing his other hand behind Tyrells
head Batty squeezes them together and squashes the
mans head like a melon The mess is not small

Palms up like a surgeon Batty walks to the drapes and
wipes off the gore and without looking back strolls out
of the room

INT TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT 90A

Styles is coming down the hall He sees Batty coming
towards him Styles looks at him curiously this is not
one of the guests As they close Batty smiles

BATTY
Could you tell me where the
bathroom is

Styles doesnt get a chance to answer Battys hand has
torn into his crotch The man is lifted off the floor
up the wall and held a moment Whatever is encased in
his pelvis is pulverized Batty lets go Styles hits
the floor He died of shock Grinding his teeth Batty
continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 91
The birthday cake has arrived the candles lit Theyre
waiting for Dad Mrs Tyrell looks around to find Batty

observing from the doorway

A little startled a little curious but ever the cor-
porate wife she smiles
MRS TYRELL
May I help you

Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 92

In the sink the faucet is on The water pink with
blood Batty is washing his hands

A portly maid emerges from the pantry Batty looks up
She stops embarrassed at being caught Her eyes no-
tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
door When she looks back Batty is right in front of
her

INT DECKARDS BEDROOM - NIGHT 93

Books scattered on the bed Rachael sitting cross-—
legged with one in her lap looking through exquisite
shots of nature Deckard is next to her watching her
like a lover like a father

DECKARD (VO)
Shed never seen the great outdoors
Never even seen books on the
subject She went through
everything I had and we talked
And there were subjects we didnt
discuss and they were words we
didnt say I couldnt say like
death like future like real But
it was hard because she was curious
and full of questions She was
more alive than anyone Id ever
known

She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo but with
no need to comment Its in her eyes She stares at
him a revelation taking shape

RACHAEL
You and I are good friends huh

He considers it and she stares at him smiling at the
wonder of it

RACHAEL
Its so easy

Convinced and not convinced he nods his head She
laughs at his solemnity Shes irresistible Deckards
pretty irresistible himself

RACHAEL
Have you ever known anybody a long
time
DECKARD
You mean a woman

RACHAEL
Uh-huh

DECKARD
Whats a long time

RACHAEL
Ten years

DECKARD
Nope Nobody could stand me that
long

The CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF
reaches out and brings it to his ear

A pause

DECKARD

DECKARD

BRYANT

He hangs up the receiver and gets up She watches him
from the bed The gun goes into his belt He loads
the ankle job and straps it on She watches every move

RACHAEL
Why do you call it retire why
dont you call it murder

DECKARD
Because its not

RACHAEL
Dont you think anything that can
suffer deserves to be considered

DECKARD
Andies only simulate suffering --
if theyre programmed for it

RACHAEL
Do you think I simulated what
happened between us

DECKARD
No I dont

Without looking at her he puts on his jacket
Hes standing in the middle of the floor with his back
to her He turns and theyre facing one another
Neither of them moves
DECKARD
Dont leave here Dont open the

door dont answer the phone

RACHAEL
What difference will it make

DECKARD
Just wait here

He goes to the door

RACHAEL
You know what I think
DECKARD
What

RACHAEL
That some of the folks around here
are more programmed then me

He has to laugh

RACHAEL
You know what else I think

DECAKRD
What

RACHAEL
This was the best day of my life

He turns and goes through the door
INT SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sebastian is putting his work table in order but his
mind is not with it and his hands are trembling

Batty Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room
talking their voices low

MARY
Lets go while there is still
time
BATTY
Where
MARY
Anywhere
Batty smiles
BATTY

Whats the point

MARY
Not to be trapped

BATTY
You underestimate the trap Mary

Sebastian has almost reached the door

BATTY
Where are you going Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
Just thought Id

BATTY
No you stay here with us Out
last night together

They all watch
Sebastian walks away from the door

BATTY
Think of yourself as a light Mary
Shine before youre turned off

Shes too fragile for that logic but it appeals to
Pris She and Batty hold a look that burns

Sebastian is by the window

SEBASTIAN
Someone is coming here

Batty goes to the window and looks down

BATTY
One man
(he smiles)
He must be good

MARY
Then go get him

BATTY
That wouldnt be very sporting

Sebastian looks ready to bolt Batty puts an arm
around him

PRIS
I want to do it

BATTY
Okay but dont kill him Save a
little for everybody A
masterpiece

A pause

BATTY
Turn out the lights Pris

EXT SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - NIGHT
In the dim nocturnal light Deckard crosses into the
courtyard fronting the building and stops He looks

around Nobody there just silence

He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-

dows off to one side of the entry
His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS

Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
pavement thirty feet below

Deckards eyes move up the line of descent the shat-
tered window on the next-to-top floor

INT SEBASTIANS APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT 96

Not much to see But Deckard misses none of it as he
crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
least exposure He looks around Elevator and stair-
well

Close to the wall he moves towards the elevator keep-
ing an eye on the stairwell door

Stepping to one side he hits the button The elevator
door slides open He reaches in presses a button and
as the doors slide shut Deckard slips a pen between
the doors jamming the operation

Deckards shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
lobby floor He pauses a moment in front of the stair-
well door then pushes it open and

INT STAIRWELL SEBASTIANS APARTMENT - NIGHT 97

Steps into the dark on the other side Suddenly he
spins dropping to the floor and FIRES three times in-
to the figure hovering to his left

The man is hanging off the floor his arms locked into
the railing neck broken -- with three holes in his
chest but he was already dead

Deckard stares at the corpse Its Mr Deetchum the
old watchman That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
feeding on him scampering for safer places Deckard
gets to his feet

The stairway rectangles ten stories up As his foot
touches the first step a raw terrified SCREAM shatters
the air It came from below Its the cry of a young
girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY
STOPS Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
laser inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence
descends the basement stairs

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT 98
At the bottom he faces a corridor The FAINT HUM OF

MACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end
The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there
Each door is fitted with a small window Deckard
steps to the side and peers through

INT GYM - NIGHT 99

Its a gym The mirror-lined walls are cracked and
tarnished the equipment atrophied from lack of use
The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor Two
weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
like idiots Deckards eyes stop on the woman

She dangles a few feet off the floor hung by the
shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling
Her head is slung forward her body limp and slightly
swaying

Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
the wall Slowly he advances toward the hanging figure
keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
door Hes not breathing hard His heart isnt pound-
ing Deckards in his element

Close enough to look up into her face he stops It
isnt grisly death that causes the reaction in his
eyes Its the innocence of her angel face

Its not something he has time to consider In the
mirror behind him he sees the door starting to open
Deckard spins He shouldnt have Pris legs snap up
crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
neck

Slowly the door swings closed but Deckard doesnt
notice His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
to the brain He jerks up his foot and reaches down
As his fingers close around the ankle laser Pris
fingers close around his wrist Deckards hand opens
like a flower The laser drops to the floor as his
eyes roll back into his head

PRIS
Naughty naughty

She lets go but before he can fall she rams a foot
into his back Hes propelled fifteen feet across the
room Slams into a machine and falls to the floor
Pris flies off the rings and comes at him

Deckard reaches out to pull himself up but shes al-
ready there Not too hard and just in the right place
she kicks him in the stomach He goes back to the
floor gagging for air Oh-so-precisely she reaches
out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
the machine

Its a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt Normally
an innocuous piece of equipment but the motor housing
on this one is missing Lots of GRINDING METAL A
bad place for flesh and bone

But thats where Deckards hand is going An eight-
year-old against a full-down man In two more seconds
his hand will be ground round Deckard tries to pull
his hand loose It wont come He yanks hard but
its welded in hers

His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg
wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
his might The hold breaks They topple back Deckard
hits the floor gulping to catch his breath Pris is up
and coming for him again She hovers over him Deckard
rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
driver

Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself

Pris just smiles takes hold of his foot and drags him

across the floor She doesnt like to leave a piece of
work unfinished Theyre going back to the machine

He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold
It doesnt stop him Hes sliding over the floor like
it was ice weight stand in tow

Pris gets to the machine yanks his foot up and forces
it toward the opening Deckard sits up a five-pound
dumbbell in his hand and clobbers her in the back It
nocks her off balance but she doesnt let go of his
foot She hooks out with a fist but misses He gets
her with a roundhouse in the face

She goes to the floor and Deckards up the dumbbell
over his head coming down with it Fighting for her
life now Pris drives a foot into his chest It lifts
him off the floor He flies back across the gym and
lands in a heap

No more games Pris is furious and moving fast She
rips a steel bar out of the wall and holding it over-
head charges him like a samurai As she comes down
for the kill she freezes

Deckard landed near the laser He crawls towards it
As in a nightmare it takes forever But he gets there

He reaches out and grabs the laser rolls over and
takes careful aim She charges towards him screaming
her rage He FIRES as she comes

The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder but
her hand doesnt let go of the bar It dangles crazily
in front of her as she charges forward

He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck Pris hiccups a
rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
next to Deckard Dead

He lies next to her chest heaving Slowly he rolls
over and gets to his hands and knees Panting he stag-
gers to his feet and stands over her swaying slightly
The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry It
might not sound like a war cry but it is

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 100

Laser in hand Deckard kicks open the swinging doors
and walks into the corridor a dangerous man

INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT 101

Deckard arrives at the main floor landing checks his
loads and continues up the stairs Hes going to shoot
the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
right or wrong

INT STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT 101A

On the next landing he throws the door open His eyes
move down the hall looking for prints in the dust
None He continues up the stairs

INT NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT 102

On the ninth floor he finds what hes looking for
Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
hall He stops to the side of it and listens Silence
Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door If
somebody were on the other side of it they arent now

He kicks the door open and dives through head first
and hits the floor in a roll POURING FIRE into the

far corners of the room but the room is empty Theres
a kitchen bar a closet and a bedroom door both
closed Deckards breathing is the only sound No
response from either door

Maybe it was a sound maybe intuition but suddenly
Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
closet The smouldering door slowly creaks open

Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet Her hand
out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
it In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
monkey Her face is bewildered frozen in fear her
body riddled with holes No recognition gap here
Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure Mary
falls to the floor like a puppet with her strings cut

Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
closet and sits on the sofa unable to take his eyes
off her

Deckard lays the laser down next to him holds out his
hand and looks at it Its steady He drops it in
his lap closes his eyes and leans back

A TAPPING from the ceiling Deckard looks up

A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end
A pause Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
gives in Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
couch where he was sitting The hole is a couple feet
in diameter -- beams cracked through exposing the
apartment above Silence Deckard wipes the plaster
dust from his eyes and mouth then whispers

DECKARD
Hello Roy

INT STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

Deckard comes out onto the landing Taking his time
he climbs the steps to the next floor the last floor
He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door
pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG
The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence The corridor is
empty

INT CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

Moving fast but cautious he passes each door until he
gest to the apartment above Sebastians Slowly he
turns the know and pushed open the door

INT APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

Except for the hole in the middle of the floor theres
nothing to see Back against the wall he moves to-
wards the bedroom but stops at the NOISE Tt sounds
like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and its coming from the
hallway

INT CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
hall Battys at the other end Except for jockstrap
and gym shoes hes nude

BATTY
You wanna play

Deckard FIRES Battys fast He ducks into a doorway
Pops out again

BATTY
Not very sporting to fire on an
unarmed opponent I thought you
were supposed to be good Arent
you the man

The makeup on Battys face is somewhere between a Coman-
che warrior and a transvestite The immensity of his
insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-
len trembling from the thrill of it

BATTY
This is how we do it up there lad
Come on

In a blue of lightning-like action Batty whips down the
hall zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast
that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur
crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh

Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact
of it then edges up to the gaping wall Batty is be-
hind him

He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head
Deckard goes to his knees then over on his face
Batty kneels next to him

BATTY
Not hurt are you You better get
it up or Im going to have to kill
you Unless youre alive you cant
play And if you dont play you
dont get to be alive

Deckards eyes are closed mouth bleeding He exhales
and makes and effort He slides his hands up even with
his chest and starts to push

BATTY
Thats the spirit

Like a matador Batty walks away By the time Deckards
on his feet Battys disappeared through one of the
doors

Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth bends down and
picks up his laser reloads and looks down the hall
towards the jeering voice

BATTYS VOICE
Come on Deckard show me what you
got Im right here on the other
side of the door But you gotta
shoot straight cause Im fast

Deckard gets to the door BLASTS it kicks it open and
FIRES at Batty But its only the reflection of Batty

INT ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT 107

The full length mirror on the other side of the room
SHATTERS Battys next to him grabs Deckards hand
and steps in closer

BATTY
Straight doesnt seem to be good
enough
Theyre face to face
BATTY

You dont have a chance do you

In an exaggeration of weary disappointment Batty drops
his head to the side

BATTY
Looks like Im gonna have to scale
it down for you Give you a
handicap I wont run through any
more walls Okay I promise to
use the doors Okay

Deckard stares back at him but doesnt respond Sud-
denly fury storms through Batty He throws Deckard out
the door knocking him down grabs him by the collar
and rams his head into the wall

BATTY
Come on lets use that brain

INT TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 108

He drags him down the hall on his knees and bangs his
head into the wall again

BATTY
Think We need a little
resilience around here

He yanks him further and bashes his head again
BATTY
Where are those balls of yours
Lets see a little bravery
The storm passes
Deckard hangs in Battys hand like a bag of laundry
BATTY
That was irrational of me -- not
to mention unsportsmanlike Wont
happen again

He drops him

BATTY
Ill be down the hall when youre
ready

Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors

Deckard gets to his knees leans against the wall a mo-
ment then punches it with his fist

On his feet hes a little wobbly Holding his breath
so he can hear above his own breathing he listens No
sound No sign of Batty The laser is laying nearby
He doesnt bother

Deckard is backing down the hall quiet as he can He
had a job to do He would like to have done it but
hes not insane He gets to the landing and turns

On the first step down he stops Battys on the land-
ing below looking up at him

BATTY
Where you going

He wait a moment for Deckards answer

BATTY
No cheating A promise is a
promise Ill honor the
handicapped but we gotta play on
the top floor You go get your
laser gun now And Ill give you
a few seconds before I come

Deckard turns back into the hall Batty smiles
Deckards running down the corridor

BATTYS VOICE
One

Halfway down the hall he finds his laser

BATTYS VOICE
Two

Deckard darts into the nearest door The apartment
above Sebastians with the hole in the floor Deckard
considers it

BATTYS VOICE
No fair jumping through holes You
might get hurt doing that THREE

Deckard dashes back into the hall chooses another door
and goes in

Battys coming down the center listening at the doors

BATTY
Six

INT TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT 113

Deckards crouched in the corner and aimed He looks at
his hand Its trembling

BATTYS VOICE
Seven

INT TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT 114
Battys standing in front of a door listening
BATTY
Oh I wonder where he is Not in
here I dont think Eight
He goes to the next door
BATTY
Maybe here Doesnt sound like

it Nine

Batty moves to the next The door to Deckard

INT TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT 115
Deckards crouched lower holding his breath -- talk
about a hair trigger Silence Battys FEET are heard

CREAKING AWAY Deckard looks around Runs a hand over
the wall behind him Battys FEET COME BACK A pause
BATTY
Ten

The door explodes

A shape hurtles across the room Deckard pivots fol-
lowing it with RAPID FIRE Its a TV He spins back
but Battys already on him He gets one SHOT off be-
fore Battys got his hand Theres a hole over Battys
right eye Blood running down his face dripping on
Deckard The right side of his face isnt working too
good The corner of his mouth doesnt quite shut --
his voice comes out slurred a little hollow

BATTY
One point for you

The would doesnt minimize his omnipotence just makes
it more malignant He throws Deckard against the far
wall Deckard FIRES Hits Batty in the shoulder

BATTY
Ho ho Try it again

He comes at Deckard jerking back and forth a cobra in
fast motion faking weaving yelping with excitement
as Deckard tries to get a shot FIRING AWAY until his
lasers empty Bloody and crazed Batty pushes up
against him

BATTY
Whats wrong Dont you like me
Im what weve made

INT TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT 116

Hes backing Deckard out the door Deckard trips and
falls Theres fear on his face The strength is gone
Something is starting to crack

BATTY
Whats wrong Arent you a lover
of Faster Bigger and Better

Deckards pedaling backwards over the floor

BATTY
Its time to die

Deckard throws the laser at him It misses Batty
throws his head back and laughs A one-eyed colossus
about to eat the world Suddenly he stops His eye
moves over the wall

BATTY
Ah
He reaches out and pinches something His lips compress
as he yanks it out of the wall Its a ten-penny nail

He holds it out to Deckard and drops it Deckard
catches it

BATTY
Thats for you

One side of Battys face smiles savagely

BATTY
Stick it in your ear and push
If that doesnt work try the
eye

Deckard stares at the nail in his hand then up at
his executioner

BATTY
Believe me itll be better
for you than what Im about
to do

Batty watches him hoping the stimulus might inspire
his victim to more action It doesnt look like it

BATTY
Well

Deckard springs to his feet and bolts But instead of
going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
door

INT TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT 2 - NIGHT 117

Provocation accomplished Batty smiles and walks lei-
surely towards the door Deckards terrified scream
and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him Batty speeds
up and moves into the room

The window pane is splattered curtains sucked out
bellowing in the wind

BATTY
Crap

He walks up to the window Deckard comes away from the
wall inching up behind him laser in both hands aimed
at the base of Battys skull Batty starts to lean
over but even before his eyes see the pavement he
knows He spins

Deckard FIRES again This one goes home Batty falls
like he was poleaxed hits the floor dead weight

Deckard starts to tremble His arms go limp as his
head tilts back and he closes his eyes He can breathe
again

On the floor Battys hand is crawling toward Deckards
ankle

With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
banana peel Deckard comes down Face knotted in hor-
ror he EMPTIES THE LASER in Battys body -- but the
hand holds on With a screech of frustration he drops
the laser and like an animal claws at Battys dead
fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut

Deckard starts to crawl pulling Batty behind him He
struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet

INT TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along
He falls gets to one foot falls again and crawls the
last couple feet to the stairwell

INT TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Groaning he tugs and pulls hauls and heaves Battys
body to the edge of the landing He pauses for breath
then lays back wedging his feet against Battys shoul-
ders and pushes Inch by inch the body goes over the
edge Then all at once it drops But the hand holds
and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it As
Deckard slides over the edge he grabs hold of the
railing

Deckards hanging three hundred feet over the basement
floor supporting himself and Battys corpse -- almost
four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers

With his free foot he chops away at Battys hand try-
ing to break it loose But its not working Deckards
fingers are starting to slip

His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over

Battys thumb With the help of gravity and everything
hes got in his right leg to push with he pushes The
thumb breaks loose Batty falls

The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good but
Deckard doesnt notice Hes in an awkward position
He must reverse the way hes facing to pull himself up
He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
left Then turns the left around so hes got an over-
hand grip

Like a man doing his last pull-up the one that cant
be done Deckard pulls himself up throws a foot over
the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing

And lies there body jerking spasmodically slowly
clenching and unclenching his cramped hand but its

his burning cheek against the cool metal hes most aware
of

Dizzy hot lungs on fire he stands -- and putting one
foot in front of the other Deckard descends the stairs

EXT SEBASTIANS BUILDING - DAWN 120

Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into

the morning The sun isnt yet risen but the sky has

begun to pale Its a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
very pretty but even though he cant show it Deckard

is glad to see it

For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
breath then walks across the courtyard towards the
street so dead on his feet he hasnt the energy to
fall

Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car The col-
lapses on the front seat

INT DECKARDS BEDROOM - DAWN 121

In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a
chair facing the pearly gray light of the window The
only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING
that comes from the bed

Quietly he gets up and walks over to her Rachael lies
sleeping one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet

Deckard stands there bettered and grim staring down
at her

Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
the bed

Rachael opens her eyes and looks up at him she smiles

EXT COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY 122

Deckards car is skimming over the narrow highway He
and Rachael in the front seat Except for the occasion-
al glance their faces are still and quiet in the cold
shine of an icy dream

The clouds overhead are soft and swift

DECKARD (VO)
She wanted to go to a place I knew
Out of the city Like one of those
pictures she saw Where there were
trees but no buildings
Rachaels face in the window watching the woods stream
by

DECKARD (VO)
We had a good time She told me a
funny story and I taught her a
song A song about monkeys and
elephants And it made us laugh so
hard we couldnt sing

EXT WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY 123

Deckard and Rachael walking The land lays white and
hushed before them

Down an aisle of maples and beeches The frosty light
slanting through the clean hard limbs

The crisp blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth

Rachael stops and faces him Her lips are parted her
warm breath turning the cold air to vapor Looking
lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees she
stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard
Nothing in her retreats even now her eyes insist on
knowing

EXT WOODS - DAY 124

Deckard walking over the snow Alone He walks slowly
mechanically through the cold unaffected by it His
gaunt face empty of expression except for the tears
running down his pale cheeks

But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted
snow there is no sound And Deckard recedes into the
silence of the freezing white landscape

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 125

Deckards car solid THROBBING GUNNING along like

some metal animal Headlights piercing the dark of the
long flat road WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-
ning THRUM And then silence And the silence
astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN

INT CAR - NIGHT 126

Deckard is behind the wheel face in shadow eyes star-
ing straight ahead

DECKARD (VO)
I told myself over and over again
if I hadnt done it they would
have
I didnt go back to the city not
that city I didnt want the job

She said the great advantage of
being alive was to have a choice
And she chose And a part of me
was almost glad Not because she
was gone but because this way they
could never touch her

As for Tyrell -- he was murdered
but he wasnt dead For a long
time I wanted to kill him But
what was the point There were too
many Tyrells But only one Rachael
Maybe real and unreal could never
be separated The secret never
found But I got as close with

her as Id ever come to it Shed
stay with me a long time I guess
we made each other real

And the ruby lights of Deckards car disappear into
the darkness

THE END
