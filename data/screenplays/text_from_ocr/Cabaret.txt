CABARET

THE TITLES TW WHITE AGAINST BLACK SCREEN GERiAN
GOTHIC LETTERING ALL SILENT

About half-way through the credits fade-in sounds
of people talking mingled with sound of cutlery and
dishes These will eventually become the background
sounds of the Cabaret ‘No music

During the final credit a-drum roll is heard demanding
attention It ends with a loud cymbal crash The
sounds abruptly stop - Silence - Black screen In

the black we hear the opening vamp (An oldhat
musical introduction to a vocal entrance short for
“vamp until ready)

At end of vamp

PULL BACK to reveal he is a little man dressed in
period tails he carries a stick and is singing to

an audience Nanging above and behind him is a large
mirror approximately the size of a small movie screen
It is tilted slightly downward and distorts the
reflection of the back of the i1C as well as the
faces of his audience

As the 1C addresses his audience we see that every
table has a telephone which connects to the other
tables Each table prominently numbered so that the
customers can call one another tease flirt make
assignations The club with all its tawdry and
p2rverse ambiance is patronized however by quite
respectable middle-aged bourgeois At the bar and at
one or two of the tables we see more questionable
patrons two voung women dressed in mens clothes
Caught in the moment of moving from the lesbians’
table to more conventional company is ELKL a very
beautiful but heavily made-up girl in a long lavendar
chiffon gown She greets several customers It is
obvious that ELKE is a “IT KAT KLUB employee We

see her pass a SALVATION ARHY GIPL who is going from
table to table soliciting money ELE sniffs dis-
dainfully

HC (contd)
Leave your troubles outside So
ee life is disappointing For

even the orchestra is beautifull

He crosses to the wings and helps pull on a rolling
platform upon which a sleazy ALLGIRL 5-piece jazz
combo is playing a chorus of WILLKOMNMEN

train noise)

Lower middle-class residential area BRIAN with
his suitcase in hand stands on the doorstep of one
of a row of houses Checks address then rings bell
There is a moments wait At the end of the street
an overhead train passes by The noise is plainly
discernable at this distance While BRIAN is consid-
ering this the door opens

Standing in it is a very young girl with a shiny clean
face but wearing a soiled old kimono which she
clutches with rather grubby little-girl hands the
fingernails of which are painted bright green The
girl is SALLY BOLES

SALLY

brush glass from which she casually empties its

(She removes the

long cigarette holder

Coming toward them on the sidewalk is a stranye
motorized vehicle three wheels a seat and a steering
device It is just large enough to hold the crippled
young man who propels it through the dark steering
with one arm the other cuddling close to hin a

very old dog wrapped against the night air in a blanket
On the front of the vehicle fly several small flags
one a swastika

As SALLY and BRIAN approach and pass this strange night
vision they do not speak When it is gone they
resume their conversation

BRIAN
Where are your parents Sally

SALLY

the noise of the train

With the trains passing SALLY shuts her mouth and

BRIAN still in bed deeply immersed in the book
LUDWIS has left him There is one sudden loud pound
on his door then SALLY bursts in hugging herself
shivering BRIAN looks up frowning

SALLY
(shivering pitifully)
Im freezing Nug me Quick
Body warmth That damned water
heater Preezing freezing °
Hug me

She throws herself against BRIAN who carefully moves
her away from his papers before he begins methodically
Slapping and rubbing her arms and back SALLY allows
this for a moment shivering encouragingly She
looks up at his serious face (he might be giving
artificial respiration for all his reaction to

this close quivering girls body) SALLY grins
mischievously snuggles against him

SALLY (cont)
Hug Tight Tichter
(BRIAN obeys SALLY
looks up at him)
Bri darling dont be so literal
(She tiptoes up kisses him
The kiss lasts a bit longer
than a moment it is returned
(HORE)

SALLY (cont)
but not passicnately
It is SALLY who pulls
away She regards BRIAN
with interest)
Youre very polite Bri I kiss

BRIAN
(laughs)
Now I return to work and you go
get dressed ‘

SALLY
(sits down on bed in
front of BRIAN Stares
up at him)
The hot water didnt really run
- out darling Under this robe Im
all warm and rosy and tingling
(reaches up pulls
at his shirt)

BRIAN
(still trying to kid)
Cool and pale Very little tingling
under British broadcloth

SALLY

at him)

whatever it is that
might be occurring

to her)
I really must get on with my work
Sally
SALLY
(plunging in)
But I mean lets be absolutely

frank Maybe you just dont sleep
with girls

‘
BRIAN is paralyzed between two reactions anger
and in his case perverse attraction -- there is a
pause as he controls himself

SALLY
(after pause pressing
on)
Oh you dont do you’

BRIAN
(finally)
Actually I dont

SALLY
(apologizes)
Gee Im sorry Bri I just
didnt get it you know I mean
its sohard for Americans to
tell with Englishmen Whether
theyre queer or just well-bred

BRIAN
(a rather thin smile)
The conditions do occasionally
overlap

SALLY
Well just for the record
are you put off by all female
bodies or justmine Is my
body ghastly to you

BRIAN
(cant help smiling)
You know your bodys beautiful
Sally

SALLY

(quickly opens the robe

to examine herself

critically)
“Do you really think so darling
It does have a certain style

(takes BRIANs hand

puts it on her stomach)
Very flat here and not much hips
rather boyish actually

BRIAN
(retrieves his hand
Ne is quite shaken but
determined not to show it)
This is an extremely banal seduction
scene Sally Youll forgive me if
I dont play it

SALLY looks at him speculatively for a moment then
ties her robe back up At last she grins

‘ SALLY
Well I just thought Id try
You might have been tempted
and It would be so convenient
Oh Bri darling dont look like
that I promise I wont pounce
again Please dont be angry

BRIAN
(cant help laughing)
Im not It isnt convenient

SALLY
(delighted with BRIANs
laugh)
I do adore vou Bri Youre my very
best friend and its much harder
to find friends than lovers

Sex always screws up a friendship

BRIANs waist affectionately)
So we just wont let it Okay

(to LOTHAR)
Well if the Communists take all
this you can emigrate

LOTHAR
Ah but it is a family trait to keep
what is ours

CUT TO
CLOSE-UP SALLY

She reacts with wide-eyed interest ‘The very mention
of wealth acts as a potent aphrodisiac She takes
LOTHARs arm snuggles close beside him as they walk

SALLY

(indicating the plants)
Ive never seen anything so adorable

(twists her neck about

as if having a sudden

twitch of pain)
Oh My neck is all stiffsomebody
give it a little rub please

The somebody is obviously meant to be LOTHAR against
whom she is pressed LOTHAR turns her about so that

he can get to the back of her neck Tenderly gently
he massagesSALLY moans pleasurably All the while
LOTHAR smiles provocatively at BRIAN baiting him some-
how BRIAN does not react LOTHAR bends over kisses
the back of SALLYs neck

LOTHAR

Shall I buy you for another night

turns happily to LOTHAR)

INT CASTLE GRAND SALON - NIGHT

The room is lighted by Many candles and by the light
t Page 75
from an enormous roaring fireplace

They have long since dined BRIAN once again more
than a little drunk stands in a long window con-
templating the night a drink in his hand He is
wearing the trousers and jacket in which he arrived
BRIAN is restless and unhappy but caught in some sort
of trap from which he is unable for the moment to
extricate himself He is angry with SALLY but unable
to focus his disapproval because he is also frightened
of himself He is strongly attracted to LOTHAR

CUT TO

LOTHAR and SALLY bent over a photograph album SALLY
‘ohing-and ahing’ as LOTHAR points things out Sud-
denly LOTHAR looks up catches BRIANs unease

LOTHAR
(teasing)
Why arent you interested in my
childhood Brian ComeI11
show you the ones on the bearskin
rug

BRIAN gives a small rather tight smile does not move
LOTHAR suddenly speaks to BRIAN in rapid German

LOTHAR
in German)
Come Be a good fellow You mustnt
make Sally unhappy

BRIAN
(answers in equally
rapid German)
How could I when she has you to
make her happy

SALLY
No fair I cant understand when
you talk so fast

LOTKAR
Im afraid Brian is bored We must
try to entertain him
(crosses room to con
cealed gramophone)
Shall we make him a cabaret

He places a record on the machine winds it It begins
to play a tango
Page 76

With an exaggerated Latinesque bow LOTHAR holds out
his arms to SALLY Laughingly she moves into them
and they proceed to kiddingly perform the silly ro-
mantic attitudes of the dance Idly BRIAN drinks and
watches

SALLY
Marvelous

LOTHAR
(eyes again on BRIAN
as he dips SALLY al-
most to the floor)
Brian seems to be bored by simple
country life

BRIAN
(pleasantly)
Not at all

LOTHAR

(continues his conver-

sation with BRIAN

never missing a beat

of the dance)
No noyou are right To be young
is to be restlessdemanding

(smiles charmingly

up at BRIAN)
So Where would you like to go if
you could go anyplace in the world

BRIAN doesnt bother to answer the question seriously
ehe shrugs then through open doors he spots the
carved leopards He smiles

BRIAN
Africa East Africa

LOTHAR
(to SALLY)
Does Africa call to you too liebling

SALLY
(everything calls to
SALTY)
Africa

LOTHAR
(casually as if pro-
posing a trip to the
corner for a pack of
cigarettes)
Then lets go The three of us
Page 77

BRIAN just smiles He cannot take this sort of talk
seriously But SALLY gasps with delight

LOTHAR

I sce that what pleases brian
pleases you Thats very sweet

(to BRIAN who watches

all this with an attempt

at cynical detachment)
Well take a boat from Genoa sail
through the Suez Canal and on to
Mombasa Then theres a rather
interesting train overland to Nai-
robiWell have to get busy with
visas

SALLY stares at LOTHAR as if he had suddenly turned
into the aurora borealis LOTHAR deeply gratified
smiles back And now as BRIAN drinks and watches
LOTHAR and SALLY become seriously caught up in their
dance Both of them move with matched instinctive
grace As they become more and more immersed in the
music and their own skill and physical propinquity
they forget BRIAN He is quickly aware of what is
happening between them He downs the last of his
drink and quietly leaves the room SALLY and LOTHAR
do not notice his departure as they dance on

Lying on the bed in slacks and shirt The room is ro-

specific territory in SALLYs room His books and

papers are spread around him but his attention is not

is once more wearing Lothars colorful sweater

There are some changes in the roomseveral vases
filled with flowers On another table sits a tray
with new proper crystal glasses and a decanter A
phonograph (new also is playing softly

Suddenly the door bursts open and SALLY enters She
is very smart looking in a new gray squirrel coat and
an obviously French hat her hair expertly coiffed
She carries several packages

SALLY
Darling

She throws down the packages and flings her arms around
BRIANs neck gives him a quick kiss then steps back
so he can take in the coat

SALLY
Do you like it Isnt it divine

BRIAN
(calmly)
Divine

SALLY
I absolutely couldnt restrain him

She runs back to bed grabs up the largest box begins
to tear it open)

SALLY

(pulls out contents

of box)

SALLY
A little slut maybe but not stupid

Oh God youve got to clear out now

She gives BRIANs still rather unyielding cheek a peck
pushes him toward door

SALLY

BRIAN goes silently When he is out of sight SALLY
has a thought and runs to the door to call after him

with herself Once in the room she stands clutching
her handbag unfocused

His face is solemn his eyes probingnone of the
chronic conciliatory attitudes we have come to expect
from FRITZ now show themselves

We see that he is seated in NATALIAs homethe library
It is a room of solid bourgeois comfortsrich leath-

Throughout the scene that follows we see FRITZ always

from NATALIAs POVNATALIA becomes for us in effect
the CAMERA What happens to NATALIA happens to us

We hear NATALIAs voice as she narrates the scene But
that is all

FRITZ sits across a chess set from the unseen NATALIA
He does not look at the board He looks Straight into
the face of NATALIATHE CAMERA

‘ NATALIA (VOICE OVER)

appears in shot and makes final checkmate move He
shrugs Returns his dark intense eyes to NATALIA

stare

FRITZ picks up the board and carelessly puts it on the
floorseveral men fall roll off the board He pays
no attention He is interested only in his erstwhile

partnerOnce rid of the chess board he now thrusts

aside the small table that held itthus removing

the final barrier between himself and WATALIA

uncertain of what has been said to Lim

Life is a cabaret old chum
Gome to the cabaret

Put down the knitting the book and the broom
Time for a holiday

Life is a cabaret old chum

Come to the cabaret

Come taste the wine

Come hear the band

Come blow a horn start celebrating
Right this way your tables waiting

No use permitting some prophet of doom
To wipe every sinile away

Life is a cabaret old chum

Come to the cabaret

I used to have a girl friend known as Elsie
‘lith whom I shared four sordid rocms

in Chelsea
She wasnt what youd call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour

The day she died the neighbors came to
snicker

Nell thats what comes of too much pills
and liquor

But when I saw her laid out like a queen

She was the happiest corpse Id ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how shed turn to me and say
