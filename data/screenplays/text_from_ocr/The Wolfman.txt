SIR JOHN

Please if I may You all know

me You know the Talbots have and
always will be one of the pillars of
this community JI am an honorable
man As such I must ask again by
what law Squire Strickland is this
woman held when adultery is no crime

STRICKLAND
Yes well Im not surprised youd
like to see her freed and forgotten
Sir John Wasnt it your son said to
have frequented the Gypsy camp

STRICKLAND (CONT )
Your son Benjamin who was witnessed
in heated arguments with this woman
and who visited her while she was
jailed 4

SIR JOHN
What kind of man are you to make
such accusations against my son

STRICKLAND
These are facts not accusations
The crime is economic Should this
forgiving husband be left unfairly
responsible for the financial burden
of the bastard child I think not

SIR JOHN
That is the reason you pretend so you
may exert your puritanical will You

wish to disgrace whoever dared to
have relations with a lowly Gypsy
So you overstep the bounds of your
authority by jailing her while you
slander my familys good name

STRICKLAND
If that is what you truly believe
let the debate be opened to all
(addressing the CROWD)
If there is anyone who also feels
this woman isthe aggrieved party
say so now Make yourself heard

SIR JOHN
Except who would dare speak against
you as you are principal landowner
and Justice of the Peace

STRICKLAND
Nonsense Yes many are indebted to
me but everyone knows I am a fair

and open-minded man They know they
can speak freely so

(addressing CROWD)

John does speak You think I am i
unjust I beg you raise your voice

stone-faced Fisk) knowing they will not speak out

Acting out favorite scenes She was

SIR JOHN
No There is no truth to it

Sir John crosses to stand close to Lawrence

SIR JOHN
With all thats befallen this
household of late Ive been

meaning to put into words some
expression of gratitude

LAWRENCE
Youre trying to say thank you

SIR JOHN
Yes yes That said when the time
comes tonight I dont care what
you have to do what excuse you have
to make you must not participate
in the hunt

LAWRENCE
Youre not serious

SIR JOHN
Dont ask me to explain Just do as
I tell you There will be plenty of
us out there without you

LAWRENCE
You you know I cannot

SIR JOHN
I ask this one thing of you as your
father This once heed my word
(trying to calm)
With your brother still gone you and
I are all that remains of this
family If anything were to happen
to me you may very well be the
last to carry on the Talbot name
(pause commanding)
Ride out if you must but break off
from the group Return here to hide
Just stay away you hear tay away

Sir John walks exiting Lawrence is left bewildered
Samson BARKS up at him goes to follow Sir John

EXT FOREST WATERFALL -- DAY

Lawrence and Gwen stand at a CLIFFS EDGE facing the
incredible view beyond the steep drop Across the ROCKY
CHASM a slender WATERFALL cascades

GWEN
Some days I expect to see him riding
up to Talbot Hall Others I know in
my heart some terrible fate must have
befallen him

(pause)
More often now I think Benjamin
simply left Moved on to start
some other life without me
LAWRENCE
No
GWEN
Perhaps with someone else
LAWRENCE
No
GWEN

We dont know We may never

LAWRENCE
I have something for you Forgive me
for not giving it to you sooner

Lawrence takes out an old folded ENVELOPE from his jacket
pocket He takes a LETTER from the envelope

LAWRENCE

You already know Ben and I wrote each
other when we could This letter
from last year Ive carried it
with me since He wrote

(READING from LETTER)
Her family of Reeves Lane
Londontown visits often with friends
here Her name is Gwen Gwen
Conliffe She is so fair as to take
your breath away I only wish
somehow you could meet her my
brother to see with your own eyes
how I have been blessed

Gwen listens greatly affected by Bens words

LAWRENCE
T am in love I can tell only
you I pian to ask her hand in
marriage

LAWRENCE (CONT)

I pray she will have me for I cannot
live without her

refolding LETTER)
This man would never leave you He
will let nothing prevent him from
returning to you so long as he is
able Bleak as the situation may
seem dont give up hope

Lawrence offers the letter Gwen accepts it grateful

LAWRENCE
We should head back

They walk INTO THE FOREST leaving the beautiful WATERFALL

GWEN
Why carry it Why this letter

LAWRENCE
I realized long ago by running
away by taking my freedom I denied
Benjamin any chance at his own I
shackled him to my father And Ben
in his goodness stayed behind to be
my fathers son all these years

GWEN

I dont believe he saw it that way
LAWRENCE

He knew nothing else had no other

option because of me His whole
life he barely even stepped foot
outside of Blackmoor

(pause)
That letter showed that Bens destiny
did find him You You are the
happiness I was afraid he might never

know

crumbling BATTLEMENTS and tall TOWERS are broken away in
places to reveal cross-section views of cavernous ROOMS and
STONE STAIRWELLS all overgrown and tangled with vines

LAWRENCE

GWEN
T can stay at Talbot Hall if you
leave me a weapon

LAWRENCE
Alone Im afraid thats out of the

will be with everyone else
FROM INSIDE THE RUINS -- SOMEONES POV

WATCHES Lawrence and Gwen Someone is LOOKING OUT from
the RUINS as Lawrence helps Gwen climb up onto her horse

IN THE FOREST CLEARING

Lawrence now climbs onto his own horse
The SOUND of FALLING STONES causes him to look back

ON THE RUINS FRAGMENTS of aged STONE tumble from beneath a
dark HOLE high on one tower No one in sight

FURTHER DOWN THE FOREST TRAIL -- MOMENTS LATER

As they ride Gwen studies Lawrence

GWEN
People have begun to talk that we
spend so much time together

LAWRENCE
Let them talk They enjoy talking

Lawrence smiles Gwen smiles

GWEN
How is it you are so very unlike the
man I first met I still cant
reconcile it

LAWRENCE
If I cant reconcile it how can you

Im glad to have made your

of such sentiment
Doctor Lloyd and Lawrence share a rueful smile

LAWRENCE
Im sure youre right

They walk on continuing to

THE GREAT LAWN

Where a breeze carries the undulating thickening FOG

In the light of many LANTERNS THREE HUNTING PARTIES gather
all heavily armed

Each PARTY consists of FOUR or FIVE PEASANTSHUNTERS on
horseback ONE HOUNDSMAN on foot each restraining FOUR
HOUNDS on short leashes along with

Sir John and Fitzgerald heading up PARTY ONE Strickland
and Col Montford leading PARTY TWO and finally Lawrence
and Dr Lloyd joining PARTY THREE All are on their HORSES

SIR JOHN
Ive been here many times before On
the savannahs and in the jungles of
the Dark Continent I have a feeling
you will learn what it is to pit
yourself against a worthy adversary
tonight Remember never
underestimate your prey

STRICKLAND
This fog complicates matters to say
the least If as legend claims the
werewolf strikes at midnight
(looks at POCKET WATCH)

Sir John holds up one finger

The Houndsman releases one dog which goes RUNNING
Quickly disappearing in the fog

Sir John Fitzgerald and the Hunters ride to give chase
FOLLOW Sir Johns party moving quickly guided by the
BARKING avoiding TREES and ducking BRANCHES in the mist
They charge down a HILLSIDE halting as they come upon the
hound barking and growling at a large impenetrable BRAMBLE

All four dogs race off together gone from sight in the mist

Stricklands party LISTENS weapons at ready as

Unseen in the miasmic gloom the HOUNDS are HEARD BARKING as
they converge GROWLING furiously as theyre ATTACKING
something From the SOUNDS of the ensuing violent
STRUGGLE there comes the savage ROAR of the WEREWOLF

The DOGS YELP being slaughteredbeing silenced

FROM THE FOG one DOGS mutilated BODY is THROWN

Landing with a bloody-wet THUD before the spooked horses
FROM THE FOG a lone surviving hound SPRINTS OUT fleeing
Strickland raises his PISTOL -- SHOOTING Col Montford and

Everyone stops shooting Listening
The WEREWOLFS ROAR comes from elsewhere farther

HOUND bleeding-out on the ground before him

realizing seeing the now riderless horse amongst them

STRICKLAND

horse suddenly SPLATTERS into the BOG -- tripped up and
falling -- THROWING Col Montford

Stricklands unnerved looking all directions

Not far away the grouping of STONE MONOLITHS is vaguely
silhouetted Strickland rides there

Strickland rides to the center of the ancient ceremonial
circle The WEREWOLFS ROAR nears The FIGURE of the
WEREWOLF materializes MOVING quickly outside the circle

Strickland SHOOTS between the monoliths targeting the
elusive BEAST till the revolvers EMPTY

Strickland leaps down from his horse pulls his RIFLE and

AMMO BAG from the saddle He SLAPS his horses flank sends

He turns peering down the sight keeps turning and aiming
frantically trying to cover all possible entry points

muddy PISTOL trying to turn his body trying to take aim

Montfords hand is SHAKING badly He tries to steady the
gun in both hands tears streaking down his dirty cheeks

It is a TORN SHIRT POCKET bearing the unmistakable TALBOT
FAMILY CREST weve seen Sir John wearing many times

PARTIES on horseback gathered on the GREAT LAWN

SLOW ZOOM IN on Sir Johns SHIRT POCKET where even partly
obscured by his JACKET the CREST is easily recognizable

BACK TO SCENE -- IN THE GRAND HALL

his shock to be overtaken by rage and by determination
He bounds back down the stairs striding towards the open
front door but stops realizing something

He turns looking up at Samson still BARKING

a good sniff of it Samson barks following the scent into
the foggy FOREST quickly leading Lawrence

They pass the eerie Talbot GRAVEYARD

EXT CASTLE RUINS -- NIGHT

Samson and Lawrence enter this clearing The towering
CASTLE RUINS appear menacing in the ghostly mist

Samson guides Lawrence towards the ruins heading across an
uneven field of fallen STONES Samson goes to start BARKING
at a large HOLE in the CASTLE WALL

Lawrence pulls Samsons leash dragging him back
He ties Samson to a downed TREE pets Samsons head

INSIDE THE CASTLE RUINS

Lawrence ducks through the HOLE warily entering a dank
moss-and-ivy-covered PASSAGEWAY To the right theres a
dead end of fallen DEBRIS to the left a narrow STAIRWELL

FOLLOW Lawrence moving urgently DOWN the twisting and
turning STAIRWELL leading with his lantern

IN THE CASTLE CATACOMBS

Lawrence exits the stairs into a TUNNEL PASSAGEWAY with’
empty BURIAL CHAMBERS in the walls He holds his lantern
down to examine FOOTPRINTS on the muddy floor RATS scurry

Lawrence runs ignoring the squealing RATS which flee ahead
and peer from the chambers He approaches an unlocked
wrought IRON GATE across the passageway pushes through

Lawrence nears the tunnels end arriving at

A massive WOODEN DOOR reinforced by a METAL SLATS

He marvels at the doors SIX formidable LOCKS and huge
CROSSBAR which can be dropped and locked across to keep
whatever in He grasps the door handle PULLING

It takes tremendous effort to swing the door OPEN

INSIDE THE DOOR

Lawrence enters a large tomb-like VAULT

Straight ahead a METAL CHAIR stands amongst a pile of many
heavy CHAINS and SHACKLES The CHAINS and even the CHAIR
itself are BOLTED into the STONE WALL behind

Lawrence approaches The WALLS and FLOOR around the chair
are COVERED in countless deep SCRATCHES CLAW MARKS

Lawrence lifts his lantern looking up
More SCRATCHES on the low stone CEILING

Lawrence turns looking to the inside of the DOOR
Its covered in METAL PLATING which is CLAWED and DENTED

Lawrence crosses to a far wall examining
A SHRINE of sorts in a small ALCOVE Melted WAX on the
alcove shelf shows where CANDLES have burnt down amongst
wilted FLOWERS under a framed PHOTO bolted into the wall
A PHOTOGRAPH of the lovely Gypsy woman CARMILLA

forest trail back towards the --

Suddenly the WEREWOLF LEAPS out from the dark forest with
a ROAR -- SLAMMING into Lawrence with violent ferocity

Lawrence hits the ground TUMBLING

The Werewolf ROLLS off SPRINGING agilely mid-roll
LANDING crouched half-hidden in the foliage

Lawrence struggles to recover in great pain as he clutches
his left arm which BLEEDS PROFUSELY through his CLAWED OPEN
sleeve He looks up to see

The Werewolf rises to full height so we finally lay eyes
upon him truly half-manhalf-wolf bipedal covered in
dense dark FUR with much GREY FUR on his face He wears
Sir Johns PANTS and tattered SHIRT His CLAWED hands
jowls and heaving chest are matted with fresh BLOOD

Sir Johns features are recognizable in the Werewolfs
frightful visage especially in the EYES but there is no
humanity there The Werewolf is an animal

The Werewolf lets out a ear-splitting ROAR fangs bared

Lawrence looks to his right
Where his PISTOL lies not far away

Lawrence dives towards the gun reaching
The Werewolf crosses the distance instantly

SMASHING into Lawrence CLAWS DIGGING IN TEETH SINKING into
Lawrences shoulder as Lawrence CRIES OUT

The Werewolf THROWS Lawrence

Lawrence lands stunned his CLOTHING further SHREDDED with
deep BLOODY LACERATIONS beneath

Lawrence tries to rise crawling trying not to black out
The Werewolf comes to STOMP one clawed foot down on
Lawrences back forcing him to the ground

The Werewolf crouches over Lawrence HOWLING victoriously
raising one clawed hand about to strike the killing blow
A RIFLE SHOT is HEARD a BULLET EXPLODING into a TREE
behind The Werewolf spins his attention captured

smoking RIFLE his horse in the fog behind him

were able to carve out a life for me
despite my incurable affliction We
kept my bestial alter-ego at bay

LAWRENCE
Until now Until Carmilla

Sir John looks to Lawrence

LAWRENCE
I saw the vault in the castle ruins
I saw the shrine you made to her It
was never Benjamin who had the affair
with the Gypsy woman It was you
t

SIR JOHN
Yes

CONT INUED
LAWRENCE
Ben was not himself once Carmilla was
jailed because he knew that you were
the adulterer Thats why he had
been seen arguing with her why he
visited her He knew Carmilla
carried your child

SIR JOHN
And look what the Philistines did to
her Her vile husband beat her
bloody before bringing her to
Strickland and yet she was the one
jailed And for what crime Love
For love For that selfsame failing
I was expected to be brought forth
and pilloried Made a pariah For
daring to know love yet one last time
in my life

LAWRENCE
Except you let this happen when you
refused to come forward

SIR JOHN
Untrue I did everything I could to
free Carmilla

LAWRENCE
Everything but accept responsibility

SIR JOHN

If I came forward they never would
have let it end She gave them a
name as I told her to The next
night would have passed without
incident I would have made certain
of that She should have been
released to leave with her tribe I
was willing to lose her if thats
what it took Against every emotion
in my heart I wouldve watched her
walk out of my life even carrying my
own child So long she was free

(fury growing)
You saw You saw how the good
villagers of Blackmoor held their
tongues while Strickland paraded
Carmilla before them After so many
years of my protecting every man
woman and child from the abomination
inside me To what end So I should
have to watch as their persecutions
drove her to her death

LAWRENCE
Youveyouve gone mad

SIR JOHN
To hell with each and every one of
them Let them mount whatever

defense they can manage till
either Blackmoor is dead or I am
LAWRENCE
Cant you see that its driven you
mad
SIR JOHN

You may be right Absolutely But
what concern is it of yours anymore
Youve been bitten You must know
what that means

Lawrence does know desolate straining in his bindings

SIR JOHN
It would have been Gods mercy if you
werent discovered alive but you
were You survived
(long pause)
Theres only one gesture of kindness
I can show you now

Sir John produces a STRAIGHT RAZOR shows its blade
SIR JOHN

Keep it hidden Till a time comes
when you are alone and can use it

Sir John comes to place the closed RAZOR in Lawrences bound

hand so Lawrence can palm it

SIR JOHN
Farewell son Farewell

Sir John walks towards the door Lawrence is demoralized
but takes a deep breath mustering one last defiance

LAWRENCE
Before you go I want you to know
I know now that you killed Ben

Sir John stops keeping his back to Lawrence

LAWRENCE
He never would have helped you
unleash the werewolf He would have
fought you And so you killed him
that very first night didnt you

SIR JOHN
I couldnt have could I Since he
went missing the day after

CONT INUED

LAWRENCE
No When Gwen said he was still at
Talbot Hall after the first murder
she was trusting in what you told
everyone But she was in London
Ben had sent her away Because he
knew what you were about to do

Sir John still faces away betraying nothing

SIR JOHN
Benjamin left Hes deserted me
just as you deserted me before him

LAWRENCE
You probably didnt even know till
you found him in the morning isnt
that so
(venting fury)
And where did you hide the body
Where did you bury my brother

The DOOR SLAMS OPEN as Creepy Guard and Dr Hendrick enter

We consider you a particularly
fascinating case

Im flattered

Creepy Guard walks back to the only door while sorting
through the MANY KEYS on his KEYCHAIN He LOCKS the door

DOCTOR HENDRICK
What youre suffering from is called

Lycanthropy Simply put its the
belief that you will be transformed
into a wolf that you will take on

certain physical characteristics of
the wolf There are legends of
werewolfism as far back as Greek
mythology and beyond Across almost
every culture you will find some
version of the changling delusion

Dr Hendrick paces Creepy Guard returns to observe

DOCTOR HENDRICK
There were ancient primal tribes
whose warriors believed that
consuming the flesh of those they
defeated would grant them their
enemies strengths The Norse
Berserkers would adorn themselves in j
animal hides before each battle In
the Medieval Ages throughout Europe
thousands of persons even tens of
thousands were put to death as
convicted werewolves i

suicide Therefore your father must

FLOWING swiftly through a MANS HEARD WHISTLING A lanky
RAGPICKER in tattered SUIT and CAP makes his way down the
tunnel carrying a 7-foot-long WOODEN POLE and a LANTERN
Hes wading in the putrid water using his pole to poke at
the GARBAGE floating and accumulated on the narrow rat-
infested WALKWAYS to either side of him

RAGPICKER
(SINGING)
The man in the moon came down too
soon and asked his way to Norwich
He went by the south and burnt his
mouth with eating cold plum porridge

Ragpicker pulls up a GLOVE examines then discards it

RAGPICKER

Oh will you walk into my parlor
said the Spider to the fly It is
the prettiest parlor that you ever
did spy

He brings up a soaking BOOT with his stick Its worth
taking so he shoves it in the SACK slung over his shoulder

RAGPICKER
Youve only got to pop your head
inside of the door and youll see
many curious things you never saw
before Will you will you walk in

From behind him the Wolfmans HOWL ECHOES distant
It gives Ragpicker pause He waits then continues leery

RAGPICKER
My fine house is always open said
the Spider to the Fly Im glad to
have the company of all who go by

regaining his footing keeping his lantern aloft
He halts crestfallen shining the lantern ahead

The TUNNEL itself ends at an OUTLET which is criss-crossed
by a latticework of METAL BARS so that while the WATERS
RUSHING out for Ragpicker its a DEAD END

Ragpicker aims his lantern back up the tunnel against the
current Before iong the RED EYED Wolfman can be seen
creeping into the LIGHT SNARLING lowly As Ragpicker backs
away we PULL BACK through the METAL BARS to

to his mouth drinking ever watchful

t

As the Wolfman drinks we PULL BACK beyond IRON BARS to
reveal that this GARDEN is actually an enclosed Z00 HABITAT
which according to its SIGN holds a

Crocodylus niloticus
Nile Crocodile

IN THE ENCLOSURE Wolfman continues sating his thirst at the
ponds edge in a rare moment of quiet calm He stops
drinking leaning forward to peer curiously into the water

Hes transfixed by his own REFLECTION for a long moment

Then just as the REFLECTION is broken by RIPPLES
An enormous CROCODILE LUNGES UP from the water reaching out
his massive jaws to CLAMP DOWN on the Wolfmans leg

The crocodile performs a DEATH ROLL DRAGGING the Wolfman
back with him into deeper water

The Wolfmans YELPING clawing and fighting back
He SLASHES at the crocodile managing to extricate his torn
BLOODY leg from the crocs craggy-toothed mouth

In the frothing water the two behemoths WRESTLE
Its a brutally violent life-and-death struggle
The crocodile SLAMS the Wolfman with his powerful tail

The Wolfman lands at the waters edge dazed
The HISSING crocodile attacks from behind

The Wolfman rolls barely avoiding the crocs gnashing jaws

The crocodile twists snapping after the Wolfman
Wolfman climbs on the crocodiles back gripping the crocs
head in both hands -- PULLING with all his might

Kneeled on the crocodiles back with the savage reptile
THRASHING beneath him the Wolfmans PULLING the crocodiles
head back further further still until finally -- the
crocodiles SPINE is HEARD SNAPPING grotesquely

The croc goes MOTIONLESS The Wolfman releases his grip
The Wolfman rises spent staggering away from his defeated
foe bearing BLEEDING WOUNDS from the encounter

The Wolfman lets out a long victory HOWL

From not far away another HOWL answers

The Wolfman turns his eyes widening

He HOWLS again Several HOWLS reply

EXT LONDON ZOO WOLF CAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

The Wolfman (favoring his now wounded leg) arrives at a big
CIRCULAR CAGE which is home to FIVE full-grown WOLVES The
wolves pace excited by Wolfmans presence HOWLING YELPING

i

Wolfmans equally excited circling watching as the
imprisoned wolves follow his every move

The Wolfman vaults over the spectator RAILING getting a
grip on the cages METAL BARS He presses his face to the
bars puzzling over them angrily rattling them

The Wolfman starts trying to bend the bars PULLING at them
The wolves pace back and forth vocalizing frantically

The Wolfman keeps trying using his inhuman strength --
beginning to BEND the creaking BARS APART

EXT LONDON CEMETERY -- NIGHT

In the middle of this vast hilly CEMETERY with tall
GRAVEMARKERS BURIAL VAULTS and eerie STATUARY for as far as
the eye can see theres a SMALL GROUP at work

By LANTERN light a greasy-faced shabbily-dressed middle-
aged GRAVEROBBER and his FOUR young STREET URCHIN
accomplices (Artful-Dodger-types) strain at ROPES tied
around a COFFIN theyre hoisting up from an exhumed GRAVE

They manage to set the heavy COFFIN beside the open grave
propping it up on the DIRT MOUND theyve dug

GRAVEROBBER
Thats the way lads A little bit
of effort leads to good things
arent I always saying
(smiles his CROOKED SMILE)
Now lets see how good

Graverobber pulls the COFFIN LID OPEN He and the Four
Urchins grin in at the CORPSE of the well-dressed MAN

GRAVEROBBER
Hello Mister Sir Glad to meet you
Pleasures all ours

Graverobber and his urchins LAUGH setting to work quickly
and efficiently removing anything of value taking RINGS
from the mans fingers and CUFF LINKS from his cuffs
Extracting a WATCH FOB and GOLD POCKET WATCH while plucking
BUTTONS from the mans SHIRT and SUIT Graverobber pries
open the corpses mouth leaning close to look inside

The youngest urchin blondehaired and rosy-cheeked
BLONDIE occupies himself removing the deceaseds SHOES

We PULL BACK so we see what the graverobbing gang does not
yet notice that the FIVE 200 WOLVES silently arrive
taking up positions amongst the neighboring HEADSTONES

Funny isnt it how this here gent
who wouldntve given us the time of
day when he was alive
(holds up POCKET WATCH)
is such a generous fellow dead

Graverobber LAUGHS again but the laugh catches in his
throat as he spots one of the wolves

Graverobber stands as the urchins all turn looking
The wolves have them surrounded

GRAVEROBBER
Alright my lads lets be calm
about this nice and caim

Graverobber licks his lips looking to a SHOVEL sticking up
from the dirt mound Meanwhile the closest wolf begins
edging forward GROWLING menacingly

GRAVEROBBER
On the count of three run

Graverobber slowly reaches for the shovel watching as that
most aggressive wolf creeps even CLOSER

GRAVEROBBER
1 2 3 RUN

The urchins scatter Graverobber grabs the shovel just as
the first wolf LEAPS at him

Graverobber SWINGS the shovel BASHING the wolf aside
The YELPING wolf goes tumbling

The four other wolves all RUN OFF
Following the urchins in different directions

Graverobber raises the shovel preparing to swing again but
hes losing his footing in the loose dirt

He TRIPS backwards over the coffin coffin LID SLAMMING as
he FALLS down into the deep dark GRAVE

IN THE GRAVE Graverobbers hurt groaning trying to rise
DIRT FALLS IN onto him as hes looking up
Just in time to see the COFFIN SLIDING

GRAVEROBBER

The heavy COFFIN SMASHES down -- CRUSHING Graverobber
ACROSS THE GRAVEYARD
Several urchins run

ZIG-ZAGGING through HEADSTONES

Two of the wolves race after them
ELSEWHERE AMONGST THE GRAVESTONES

Blondie our favorite urchin runs for all hes worth still i
hugging the dead mans SHOES to his chest
Two ravenous wolves are right behind

Blondie glances back terrified Ahead there are TWO
VAULTS close together Its a tight fit but Blondie
disappears down the NARROW SPACE between them

When the two wolves arrive side-by-side their attempt to
follow becomes a SNARLING FIGHT over right of way

FURTHER ON

Blondie ducks down in the shadow of a massive GRAVEMARKER
pressing against the cold stone hiding The SNARL of the
wolves is soon HEARD Blondie watches as down the ROW of
GRAVES the two wolves arrive prowling

The wolves SNIFF at the ground heading Blondies way

Blondie notices for the first time that hes still got the
shoes He swallows deciding Carefully trying to make as
little noise as possible Blondie THROWS one shoe

The SHOES HEARD landing a few rows down
The two wolves immediately raise their heads
They rush off in the direction of the sound

Blondie grins relieved He stands slowly craning his neck
to make sure the coast is clear Something WET starts
DRIPPING down onto his shoulder Blondie notices looking
at the droplets RED droplets

Blondie looks straight up

ABOVE standing balanced atop of the huge GRAVEMARKER is

the Wolfman leering down He DROPS letting out a ROAR

He touches the wounds not fully understanding

Lawrence looks down at his tattered blood-stained SHIRT and
PANTS He examines his hands and forearms which are
covered in SCRAPES and LACERATIONS Theres BLOOD under his
FINGERNAILS Now realization begins to come to him

As Lawrence turns to look out over the storm shrouded CITY
the full weight of the lost evening crashes down upon him

He falls to his knees numbed by the horror of it the RAIN

You are cutting this awfully close

wont be ourselves anymore Or is

armed myself if Id wanted shot

than you

Youll hear no argument from me
Sir John swigs morosely from his bottle

LAWRENCE

You killed him with one hand buried
him with the other and still managed

somehow to remove yourself from

blame It was Bens fault because
he tried to protect the villagers
My fault you attacked me because I

had been warned Mother died not at

your hands but at the hands of the
beast

(furious)
All of my life I thought this
family cursed But you were the
curse on us Father All along it

was you
SIR JOHN
You come here to speak for
Benjamin to avenge him
Sir Johns still pacing
SIR JOHN

First answer how you can even dare
call him your brother Or did you
imagine a handful of letters across
the years could make up for your
betrayal Because thats what your
leaving was a betrayal

Its Lawrences turn to face his wounding guilt

SIR JOHN
You know fuli well how you wronged
him how it was as if a part of

himself was torn away when he found
you gone He loved you

(pause)
For those wounds you inflicted upon
him I admit could never have

forgiven you

LAWRENCE
What of the wounds you inflicted

SIR JOHN
He may not have been able to bring
himself to tell you what he truly
thought of you but Ben and I we
spoke often of your cowardice

LAWRENCE
You neednt remind me of my debt to
him Im here to repay some part of
it tonight

Lawrence looks across to
The GRANDFATHER CLOCK Its 1149

LAWRENCE
As for cowardice it means so
little coming from a man who having
torn out the throat of his beloved
wife hadnt the courage to end his
own life

SIR JOHN
Again think what you will of me and
the suffering thats been my lot I
dont expect you to believe me but
I wouldve gladly traded places with
your mother if I could have

LAWRENCE
Easy to say

SIR JOHN
As it was my death would have done
nothing more than to orphan my sons

LAWRENCE
And all the better for it we would
have been Or have you forgotten
You murdered us One by one you
murdered us all Look around

Theyre standing at the center of the Grand Hall

This is what remains of the family
you speak of with such reverence
Your trophies the sound of your
own voice the ghosts of your
victims Thats all you have left
Everything else you destroyed

All for Carmilla

SIR JOHN
Dont you speak her name

LAWRENCE
Her own love was proven beyond a
doubt She suffered endless
humiliations though she could have
had her freedom merely by confessing
your name But she kept silent
to protect you Out of love

Lawrence keeps the gun trained on Sir John

LAWRENCE
You meanwhile kept a different
silence Having weighed your
feelings for her against your
instinct for self-preservation You
wouldnt dare risk your social
standing or the precious honor of the
Talbot name So you abandoned her
to her husbands tender mercies And
she took her life alone
Heartbroken

Sir John drinks sunk in grief

LAWRENCE
You were the end of her not
Strickland not the citizens of
Blackmoor You were her reason for
living and her reason for dying

Sir John wheels THROWING his bottle
It SHATTERS against the wall

SIR JOHN
No more Ill hear no more

LAWRENCE
For you to commit murder in her name
and call it vengeance is a sick
perversion of her memory

SIR JOHN

Then be done with me Enough talk

End it now That is a gun in your

hand is it not Oh but first

first let me inform you of one small

detail You see before you came
in I took the liberty of turning

the clock back ten minutes i

ZOOM IN on the GRANDFATHER CLOCK which now reads 1150

which to screw up your courage is

ruth

The BLACKMOOR CLOCKTOWER is HEARD TOLLING from the distance

Sir John steps up defiant pounds his chest

SIR JOHN
Here is your chance to finally show
your father what you are made of
If you think you have it in you to
pull the trigger DO IT Do it

Lawrence grits his teeth angry terrified

Hes leveling the revolver squarely at Sir Johns chest but
the gun TREMBLES in his hand With the far off CLOCKTOWER
TOLLING all Lawrences years of fear of and pent-up hatred
for his father culminate in this Gecisive instant

what difference my returning to

Sir Johns manic seems almost proud

effort I honestly didnt think you
had it in you

Lawrence is on his feet letting out a CRY as

He TACKLES Sir John They go CRASHING through the sitting
area scattering the CHAIRS and SIDE TABLES

They fight in front of the roaring FIRE trading blows

Sir Johns fists STRIKE like sledgehammers

Lawrence manages to block one of his fathers swings
countering with a PUNCH that sends Sir John to the floor

Sir John wipes his bloodied mouth as hes rising

SIR JOHN
Nicely done

Lawrence is immediately on Sir John pinning him getting
both hands around Sir Johns neck

Lawrence puts everything hes got into tightening his
STRANGLE HOLD on his fathers windpipe Sir John struggles

And just when it seems like Lawrence has the upper hand
Just as Sir Johns having the life choked out of him

Sir John STARTS TRANSFORMING His TEETH LENGTHEN and become

Much to Lawrences dismay hes now fighting the brutally
powerful GREY-WEREWOLF in MID-TRANSFORMATION Grey—Werewolf

Lawrence FLIPPING backwards in the air

Lawrence THUDS to the floor across the room

Grey-Werewolf rises the change complete He looks
around furious and disoriented as one might imagine
He announces himself with-a window rattling ROAR

Lawrence covers his ears as hes getting to his feet

Grey-Werewolf turns heading for Lawrence nostrils flaring
saliva dripping from his wicked maw

Lawrence goes to a dusty SUIT of ARMOR taking the long
deadly SPEAR the posed KNIGHT was holding

As Grey-Werewolf advances thirsting for carnage Lawrence
wields the spear Grey-Werewolf doesnt seem to care or
understand the spear till Lawrence

SLICES into Grey-Werewolfs arm Grey-Werewolf backs off
bloodied Confused Lawrence keeps SWINGING the spear
keeping Grey-Werewolf at bay

Lawrence maneuvers over to grab an unlit OIL LAMP from a
WRITING DESK against the wall THROWS the LAMP

The oil lamp SHATTERS against Grey-Werewolf SOAKING the fur
of his arm torso and beastly face with OIL

Undeterred Grey-Werewolf advances
Lawrence is backed up against the desk trapped

He raises the spear -- STABBING

The spear PIERCES Grey-Werewolf below his left collar bone

Grey-Werewolf SCREAMS staggered clutching the spear

Lawrence runs over to the mounted GUN RACK where many of Sir
Johns PISTOLS and RIFLES are displayed
He grabs a large SHOTGUN

Grey-Werewolf grasps at the spear but the spears flared
arrowhead-like point is impossible to pull out backwards

starting to GROW Its happening Transformations begun

Lawrence looks over his shoulder to where
Grey-Werewolf still struggles to remove the spear

Lawrence looks over his other shoulder to
The FIRE in the fireplace

ACROSS THE ROOM

Grey-Werewolf falls to his knees falling on the spears
shaft which drives it further into his body

AT THE GUN RACK

Lawrence sucks air struggling against the irresistible
forces overtaking his physiology He slams the AMMUNITION
BOX SHUT lifting it as he stands fighting a wave of pain

FUR is APPEARING across Lawrences face as he runs
He stumbles to the fireplace lifting the closed ammunition
box and HEAVING it INTO THE FIRE Mission accomplished

Lawrences body contorts involuntarily taking him to his i
knees His TRANSFORMATIONS PROCEEDING in earnest
His body QUAKES as his lupine alter-egos winning out

ACROSS THE ROOM

Grey-Werewolfs pulling the spear towards him -- hand over
hand -- FEEDING its entire length through his body till the
bloody spear finally CLATTERS to the floor behind him

Grey-Werewolf turns his attention back to Lawrence
Except Lawrence is now THE WOLFMAN ROARING

AT THE CENTER OF THE ROOM

Grey-Werewolf and the Wolfman circle each other
Theyre sizing one another up

They both rush forward GRAPPLING
Its a vicious werewolf vs werewolf battle royal

Above the Wolfman SWINGS himself up

LANDS standing astride the still wildly CAREENING
chandelier He ROARS to the ceiling as i

Grey-Werewolf DROPS attacking
COLLIDING with the Wolfman pulling them both down

BELOW Grey-Werewolf and the Wolfman TUMBLE down the
central STAIRCASE fighting all the way
They hit the floor sent SPRAWLING

As The Wolfman rises Grey-Werewolf LEAPS onto him from
behind grabbing on and SINKING HIS TEETH into Wolfmans
shoulder Wolfman HOWLS

Grey-Werewolf hangs on relentlessly BITING DEEPLY while
Wolfmans CLAWING back at him trying frenziedly to throw
him off and its just then that

IN THE FIREPLACE the burning ammo box EXPLODES

The massive EXPLOSION throws a huge FIREBALL -- SHOOTING
whistling BULLETS and PELLETS in every direction at once

The BLAST sends the Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf FLYING ina
shock-wave of burning DEBRIS and sizzling BULLETS
WINDOWS are SHATTERING

The Wolfman SLAMS into one wall landing in a heap his body
bearing many SMOLDERING BULLET WOUNDS

Grey-Werewolfs fallen by the STAIRS rising up and
SCREAMING as half his body is BURNING The LAMP OIL that
soaked his fur is now ablaze

Grey-Werewolf writhes spastically trying to shake off the
flames which only makes it worse He FLEES headlong into
the HALLWAY under the STAIRCASE

EXT TALBOT HOUSE REAR GARDENS -- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT
eee ere NS ER TT OUNIGESY

The half-BURNING FIGURE of Grey-Werewolf comes SMASHING out
through the WINDOWS of the -CONSERVATORY

Grey-Werewolf goes ROLLING down through the hillside
GARDENS still BURNING as hes TUMBLING out of control

INT GRAND HALL -- NIGHT
The Wolfman rises slowly FIERY EMBERS rain down
Everywhere CURTAINS RUGS and TAPESTRIES are ABLAZE
The explosion has doomed Talbot Hall
EXT REAR GARDENS -- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT
The Wolfman leaps out the jagged HOLE in the conservatory
WINDOWS He lands in the GARDENS searching warily
He heads for the FOREST

CUT TO
INT GWENS COACH -- IN MOTION -- NIGHT i

Gwen looks out the COACH WINDOW horrified upon seeing
In the distance TALBOT HALL BURNS

CUT TO

EXT FOREST CASTLE RUINS -- NIGHT

The Wolfman enters the clearing presided over by the looming
CASTLE RUINS He searches SNIFFING the air watchful

As he nears the ruins a huge STONE comes SMASHING DOWN --
barely missing him -- imbedding into the ground

The Wolfman looks up to where
Grey-Werewolf stands atop a high CORNER TOWER HURLING
another huge STONE down

The Wolfman dodges the deadly projectile runs and LEAPS
He starts quickly SCALING the tower

Above Grey-Werewolfs terribly wounded upper TORSO ARM
and half his FACE sickeningly BURNED the FUR BURNED OFF
He YELLS down KICKING loose a section of the BATTLEMENT
The Wolfman scrambles aside to avoid the falling STONES

CUT TO
EXT TALBOT HOUSE -- NIGHT
As the coach arrives Gwen leaps out
She and the Driver look on in awe as SMOKE and FLAMES pour
from the MANSIONS broken WINDOWS and open FRONT DOOR
Gwen runs to the STAIRS past where Lawrences HORSE is tied
INT TALBOT HOUSE GRAND HALL -- NIGHT
Gwen enters surrounded by FLAMES She covers her mouth and

nose taking in the heat-warped scene of destruction
FIRE SPREADS irrevocably consuming everything

GWEN
(calling out)
Lawrence Lawrence

CLOSE-ON the beautiful PORTRAIT of LAWRENCES MOTHER as
its BURNING FLAMES hungrily devour ancient paint
MOTHERS FACE blisters her image disappearing into ash i

Gwen looks straight up retreating as
Above the ROPE holding the chandelier BURNS FRAYING

Gwen flees into the ENTRY PARLOR not looking back as the
CHANDELIER CRASHES THUNDEROUSLY down behind her

EXT TALBOT HALL - -- NIGHT
Gwen runs down the front stairs calling i

GWEN
Where are you Lawrence

A far off HOWLING is HEARD Gwen turns listening intently
Another ROARING CRY comes from the distance

Gwen runs to Lawrences horse untying it and climbing up
She RIDES off to follow the werewolfs ululation

cur To
EXT CASTLE RUIN -- NIGHT

Just as the Wolfman climbs atop the corner tower
Grey-Werewolf makes a spectacular LEAP

Grabbing onto the curved outer wall of the larger
neighboring TOWER the CASTLE KEEP Grey-Werewolf climbs

Behind the Wolfman JUMPS after
Actually leaping INTO one of the gaping HOLES in the side of
the keep climbing the exposed SPIRAL STAIRCASE INSIDE

AT THE TOP OF THE KEEP

The Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf arrive simultaneously in the
remains of this large circular ROOFLESS ROOM at the
highest point of the ruins They square off both letting
loose nightmarish CRIES of RAGE But neither is going back
down of course and so the pitched BATTLE is REJOINED

They start RIPPING INTO EACH OTHER
SLASHING and COUNTER-SLASHING unrelentingly
Sending BLOOD SPRAYING up into the night air

Grey-Werewolf SWINGS but the Wolfman catches the blow and
BITES a CHUNK out of Grey-Werewolfs forearm

Grey-Werewolf SPINS BASHING the Wolfman back

Wolfman SLAMS against a WALL which immediately FALLS AWAY
exposing the PRECIPITOUS DROP beyond

Then the whole TOWERS SHAKING

BELOW FISSURES begin spider-webbing across the towers
already FRACTURED surface

The Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf continue their animalistic
Danse Macabre trading LACERATING STRIKES the both of them
covered in countless crimson SLASHES and GOUGES

Suddenly a RUMBLE is HEARD growing DEAFENING as

The FLOOR literally FALLS OUT from under the Wolfman and
Grey-Werewolf The entire TOWER is CRUMBLING DOWN

We lose sight of the Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf in the
AVALANCHE of falling STONES and rising DUST

ON THE FOREST TRAIL
FOLLOW Gwen riding quickly holding her PISTOL arriving

AT THE RUINS

Gwen rides into the clearing looking to the DUST CLOUD
hanging over the castle As she urges her horse forward

Grey-Werewolf rises into view climbing RUBBLE to the stand

atop a low section of broken RAMPART WALL hes carrying the

unconscious Wolfman over his head in both hands
Gwen is aghast

Grey-Werewolf HOWLS to the sky throwing Wolfmans
motionless body to the forest floor below

Grey-Werewolf leaps down
Moving to where the Wolfman lies unconscious

GWEN
No

Gwen struggles to control her rearing horse taking aim --
FIRING her pistol repeatedly

BULLETS STRIKE around Grey-Werewolf Hes HIT in the ARM
BLOOD SPLATTERING He turns to face Gwen SNARLING

Gwen keeps firing but her GUNS gone EMPTY
She yanks on her reins RIDING AWAY
Grey-Werewolf angrily gives chase

FURTHER UP THE FOREST TRAIL

Gwen rides full out glancing back
From the DARKNESS Grey-Werewolf is closing the distance

EXT FOREST WATERFALL -- NIGHT

Just as Gwen races into the WATERFALL CLEARING
Grey-Werewolf JUMPS onto her horses REAR HAUNCHES
DRAGGING the SCREECHING horse down

Gwen is THROWN to the dirt
Grey-Werewolfs THROWN ROLLING

The wounded horse clamors to its feet fleeing
Gwen recovers running towards the CLIFF and roaring
WATERFALL ahead Grey-Werewolf pursues

Grey-Werewolf LEAPS forward
Taking Gwen to the ground

Gwen SCREAMS trying crawl away but the gory Grey-Werewolf
is astride her holding her Hes bent over her TOUCHING
her DRESS almost gently as if toying with her

His claws TEARING the fabric

Gwen keeps CRYING OUT as Grey-Werewolf leans his monstrous
burned visage very close to her face breathing and drooling
onto her as he studies her SNIFFING He brings one hairy
hand to her face his claws faintly brushing her cheek

Grey-Werewolf rears up keeping a grip on Gwen ROARING
Another ROAR ANSWERS As Grey-Weréwolf wheels ‘

The Wolfman arrives at full speed SLAMMING Grey-Werewolf
‘KNOCKING him off of Gwen

The Wolfman lands on top of Grey-Werewolf begins POUNDING
ON HIM - ROARING with RAGE

The stunned Grey-Werewolf still keeps fighting struggling
even as the Wolfman leans in and opens his fanged mouth
wide -- going for Grey-Werewolfs throat

The Wolfman pulls himself closerever closer till finally
he SINKS HIS TEETH IN -- RIPPING GREY-WEREWOLFS THROAT out

Gwens on her feet backing away

The Wolfman rises drenched in BLOOD looking down as Grey-

Werewolf dies The Wolfman lets out a sustained HOWLING CRY

Grey-Werewolf lying dead TRANSFORMS back into SIR JOHN

Gwen turns looking for an escape Too late as
The Wolfman looks to her moving towards her

Gwens trapped as the Wolfman begins circling

GWEN
No Lawrence its me Its Gwen

The Wolfman circles never taking his burning eyes off her
Gwen turns so shes always facing him pleading

GWEN
Lawrence please Dont do this
Look at me You you know who I

am You know me
The Wolfman SNARLS regarding her as easy prey

GWEN
This is not what you are Your
father did this You are Lawrence
Talbot There must be some part of
you left Please hear me

The Wolfman begins stalking towards her Gwens CRYING
GWEN
Remember what you said to today

GWEN (CONT)
If goodbye is truly all we have
this is mine Know that I had
feelings for you Lawrence Remember
that I loved you I loved you too

CLOSE-ON GWEN REFLECTED in the Wolfmans narrowing eyes
just as there seems to come some glimmer of recognition

For a moment the Wolfmans ghastly features soften as he
regards Gwen like perhaps the man trapped inside the
beast has somehow resurfaced

The Wolfman edges closer not threateningly but with a kind
of curicsity Gwen recognizes the moment

GWEN
Lawrence

Suddenly the Wolfman rears back HOWLING arms extended
claws clutching -- a lamenting tortured HOWL

Gwen recoils covering her ears stumbling back
She falls to the ground

The Wolfman charges at Gwen
Gwen SCREAMS as he is upon her

The Wolfman LEAPS over Gwen running across the clearing
moving straight for the CLIFFS EDGE

Gwen turns to look realizing

GWEN
No

At the CLIFF overlooking the WATERFALL the Wolfman LEAPS
out into MID-AIR FALLING into the chasm
PLUMMETING a great distance

BELOW

The Wolfman SMASHES into the jagged CLIFFSIDE

FLIPPING again and again as he
FALLS
ever downward

His body being BASHED and brutalized LIMBS RAVAGED
BONES BREAKING consciousness gone till at last

The Wolfman SPLASHES into the RIVER BASIN at the base of the
WATERFALL Hes immediately gone from sight below the
CHURNING WATER He does not resurface

ABOVE

Gwen staggers to the cliffs edge looking down her hand
over her mouth She lets out an echoing CRY

She kneels hanging her head bereft SOBBING
The FULL MOON shines down through the treetops

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FOREST RIVERBANK -- DAWN

BIRDS SING On the dawn-kissed banks of the RIVER down-
stream from the roaring WATERFALL feeding it we find

LAWRENCES CORPSE battered and broken Human again
Lying there with his eyes closed half-in the river while
the shores gently undulating water caresses his hair and
placid face Lawrence looks almost at peace

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
EXT ENGLISH COASTLINE -- OVERVIEW -- DAY

Above the CLIFFS of a section of English COASTLINE with the
OCEAN pounding rocky SHORES below we find the relocated
GYPSY ENCAMPMENT MALE and FEMALE TRIBE MEMBERS go about
their daily lives amongst the settlements TENTS and WAGONS

IN THE ENCAMPMENT

At the CLIFFS EDGE the ancient fortune-teller Old
Maleva peers out across the endless OCEAN

She turns heading back through the camp
IN ONE TENT

Old Maleva enters A BABY can be HEARD CRYING THREE young
GYPSY NURSE-MAIDS are crowded around a veiled INFANTS
CRIB As they see Old Maleva approaching they step away

Old Maleva comes to part the cribs VEILS reaching in to
gently pick up the crying BABY a dark-haired BOY mere
months old wrapped in BLANKETS His EYES are GREEN

Sullen sallow-faced Bela enters

Old Maleva goes to sit cradling the child lovingly

Bela walks to stand at Old Malevas side Old Maleva begins
reciting a SING-SONG an INCANTATION in a whispered
incomprehensible tongue gently rocking the now quieting
child back and forth in her arms

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BLACKMOOR FIELD -- DAY

Where the Gypsy encampment once stood in Blackmoor where
all that is left are the THREE unmarked GRAVESTONES

We PAN DOWN into the very earth INTO CARMILLAS GRAVE
Where we are able to look upon the rotted withere ace of

CARMILLAS ENSHROUDED CORPSE inside her WOOD COFFIN and we
can see the wide dried-brown BLOOD STAIN left from the
long still gaping INCISION that was CUT INTO HER WOMB
