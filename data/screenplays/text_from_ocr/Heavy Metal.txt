FADE UP ON
A WHEATFIELD

A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun

As the camera skims overtop titles start to roll Ahead

of us an odd-looking service van comes into view sputtering
along a dirt road Getting closer we can see the driver a
thin bookish man with a neat mustache This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield The house has several futuristic radar

devices on the roof that rotate constantly
AUSTIN gets out opens the vans rear doors and pulls out
two large metal boxes

THE ATTIC WINDOW
The curtains part ever so slightly and a pair of eyes peer
down

CUT BACK TO

THE VAN

AUSTIN shuts the vans rear doors and carries the two metal
boxes into the house The titles stop rolling as we

cut TO

INSIDE THE HOUSE

AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption twice his size There are strange tools all
over the floor

Putting down the diagram he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption
clamps it down and plugs some wires into the globes receptacles
Then he opens the second box Inside is a glowing green ball
Using a pair of special tongs AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine

in the back

As soon as the ball is inside the machine hums to life The

glass sphere sparkles and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it

AUSTIN
(looking at the holograph)
Hmmmm
He takes a strange tool and moves out of frame to make an

adjustment underneath the machine Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark

AUSTIN
(seeing sparks)
Uh - oh

As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen the
green planet begins to silently shake

cut TO

SPACE
With an explosion that rocks the universe a huge chunk rips

out of the green planet and shoots off into space leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake

CUT BACK TO

AUSTIN

Not noticing the silent image on the holograph he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments

cut TO

A FOREST

From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead
dropping balls We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance

The camera then pans over to a forest patch where a beautiful
girl approaches picking mushrooms

cut TO

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET

An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball and is drawn to it Picking the sphere up she looks
at it Something inside her warns her of its danger but
unable to resist she puts it in her basket and continues on
DISSOLVE TO

THE GATES OF KRAAN

Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home

cut TO

THE GIRLS BEDROOM

The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner Through its side the green ball
begins to glow brightly

Getting closer we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl pulling the green
ball behind it

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl like a cocoon Slowly the camera pans

up the wall and moves out through the window and beyond

the city gates rising higher and higher

cut TO

THE OUTLANDS

Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages the camera

heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of

a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds

mountains where the huge planetoid fell Finally from high
above the foothills we begin to come down

In the hills below us hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along mesmerized toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble

cut TO

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
THE LINE OF BARBARIANS
At the front of the line the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points

cut TO

THE MOUNTAINS
A strange green foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians

cut TO

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS

The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going One by one their eyes turn green and they start to
change becoming hairier uglier and stronger

As their transformations are complete the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans

DISSOLVE TO

THE GATES OF KRAAN

A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan In the glow

of sunset the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER riding a black
war-horse appears at the hillside and stops Then with a
thundering of footsteps the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him filling the horizon

cut TO

THE BARBARIAN LEADER

He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as wild-
eyed he screams to signal the attack The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city destroying everything in their path Smoke
and flames are everywhere Ahead of us terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught

As we track up over the burning rooftops we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below Shouting

a command he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city

cut TO

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS
At the far end of this huge glass hall the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table From outside we hear the battle

raging

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members

COUNCILMAN 3

Theyre killing everyone We
must escape

COUNCILMAN 2
The city is burning
COUNCILMAN 4
(throwing a parchment

before the Elder)

Even the mountains glow green and an
evil slime oozes down

COUNCILMAN 1

Elder we must arm ourselves We
must fight

ELDER
Silence

Everyone gets quiet Looking at the parchment thrown before
him the ancient withered ELDER rises to his feet

ELDER
We are not a race of warriors
We are statesmen and scientists
From our very beginning it was ordained
that the warrior-race of Taarak the

Defender would aid us in times of need
This was the Pact

COUNCILMAN 1

Taarak the Defender His race is
dead They cannot defend anyone

COUNCILMAN 2

Some say that the race is not dead
- that one still lives

COUNCILMAN 1

One What good is one

ELDER

One of Taaraks blood can do much

Outside the sounds of battle grow louder A boy appears at
the doorway

BOY

Elder They are at the walls

COUNCILMAN 3

Well who is this last Defender
How can he be summoned

ELDER
It is Taarna of the blood of
Taarak the Defender - the last of
the race And must be summoned as

my forefathers summoned Taarak
himself - from within

COUNCILMAN 2

But will this Defender answer

ELDER
A Taarakian has no choice They
must answer It is in their blood

The clattering of armour becomes audible

BOY
They are in the halls They are coming
ELDER
(calmly to the boy)
Bar the door
(to the Councilmen)

We will summon the
Defender together

The Councilmen nod
ELDER
(shutting eyes)

Taarna Taarna

As the Councilmen take up the chant
cut TO

THE DOOR

As the boy begins to bar the door it bursts open flinging him
aside Standing in the doorway surrounded by his men is
the BARBARIAN LEADER

With a laugh he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boys chest as the crazed
troops rush in around him

The chanting continues as we
CcuT TO

THE OUTLANDS

We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land As the Councils
distant chanting fades out all is quiet

Suddenly from behind us we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air Just above our heads TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird

cut TO

TAARNAS FACE

She is beautiful with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind

Below her on the ground she sees a humanoid running in terror
chased by an ugly four-legged mutant creature

Spurring her bird forward TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it She then hoists the creature up into
the air and tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly

Flying down to the grateful humanoid she dismounts As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck

HUMANOID

I owe you my life Let me
repay you

He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand pulling her
towards him His eyes change to a bright green as he forces

her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes As he
molests her TAARNA is distracted She hears something - voices
inside her chanting her name

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attackers
ears As he holds his ringing ears she gets up lifts him
above her head and hurls him mercilessly to the ground

Still hearing the chanting she jumps on her bird pulls out

a second rope and lassoes the barbarians feet She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall jagged rock
next to the growling creature

As TAARNA flies off the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily

cut TO

AUSTIN GRIMALDI

He is still sitting on the floor working on his machine

As the camera pulls closer we see that AUSTIN is reaching

deep inside the machineworks trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron The connection
breaks and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering As the smoke grows
thicker the machine starts to buzz loudly

AUSTIN
Dammit
AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers and reaches back to retrieve the part

The camera follows AUSTINS arm into the chassis where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything The buzzing sound
grows and changes into the sound of powerful throbbing
engines Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone

BOMBARDIER
(V0)

Where the hell are we

Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night

cut TO

THE GROUND BELOW

The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky The
scene is almost serene The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen and as the
camera continues panning we pass a large red rising sun on
the bombers fuselage The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard

There is a moment of tranquillity as jungle sounds fill the
air The soldier almost dozes suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops and for a brief moment there is complete silence

then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward startled
Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet
Silhouetted figures rush by

CUT TO

A GUN EMPLACEMENT
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines

EXT - THE PACIFIC PEARL

She rejoins the rest of the group The formation is not
quite as tight as before As the formation flies along
puffs of cloud pass by occasionally obscuring a machine

CcuT TO

LOW VIEW OF THE PACIFIC PEARL

Under the Pacific Pearls belly we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing

CcuT TO

THE NOSE OF THE PACIFIC PEARL
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him

BELLYGUNNER

THE COCKPIT
The dead co-pilots pale face is momentarily electric blue

lit by the lightning flash We pan past him to the compass in

OUTSIDE THE PLANE

We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine

PILOT
(V0)

Christ now theyre all doing it

CcuT TO

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
All the dials are going haywire Above the instrument panel

we see the windshield is spattered with rain

BOMBARDIER
(V0)

You guys quit talking business

Im trying to sing here Oh I

PILOT
(irritably)

Can it Stepek we got real problems

Just then through the rain a strange green glow is seen
in the distance It begins to curve toward the aircraft

CcuT TO

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET

The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow
BELLYGUNNER

Jesus Look at that

From under the starboard wing we see the object approaching

PILOT
(V0O)

BELLYGUNNER

Its out there just look at it

PILOT
(V0O)

For Christ sake give us a position

BELLYGUNNER

Its about four oclock just below
Holy Shit its coming right at us

The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine

cut TO

PILOTS POV
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window the number three prop is bent

and windmilling wildly It has a strange green luminescence
about it the whole machine shakes

PILOT

Damn

The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilots job of
feathering the bad engine Suddenly its too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing

CUT TO
OUTSIDE THE PLANE
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircrafts

skin near the TAILGUNNERS position

The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No 2 engine The pressure drops The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly A red warning light begins to flash

PILOT
(to himself)
Goddamn it now what
He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing It detaches
one of the cooling gills then another and another They blow
away in the slipstream
PILOT
Gremlins

(rubbing his eyes)
Jesus I must be getting tired

cut TO

THE BELLYGUNNER

He looks in to the kids reargun compartment All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton

TRAVIS turns horror frozen on his face Quick as a flash

from seemingly nowhere something flies at him and grabs his
throat The mask on his face falls off and we get a split

second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame

PILOT
(V0O)

PILOT
(V0)

For God sakes Stepek shut up
STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle He is lying on

his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft
He is about to make another smart ass reply when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey

BOMBARDIER

Oh my God theres theres
ahh keep away keep away
(struggles)

hey no hey somebody
(screams)

NAVIGATOR
(V0O)

Stepek you stupid sonovabitch will

you lay off the booze youve got the
DTs

STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor

He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses

cut TO

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT

The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream kicking
madly We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures

CUT BACK TO

STEPEK

He is losing his grip with one hand but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone out
into the night

cut TO
THE PLANE
Suddenly the No 2 engine begins to backfire blasting back
large gobs of orange flame The oil heat and manifold gauges

are off the dial and red lights frantically flash Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window

Pieces begin flying off the engine The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces

cut TO

THE PILOT

He is scared

PILOT

Holden for Gods sake get up
here on the double

NAVIGATOR
(V0O)

The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot

NAVIGATOR

What is it skip
(looking out windows)

JESUS H CHRIST

PILOT

Hold em off Im taking her down
He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings

The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in

The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up grabbing the flare gun

from its rack He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow

NAVIGATOR
(struggling)
Okay you little bastards shit
(screams)

THE RADIO OPERATOR

The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him
Wreathed in flames he falls back into the fuselage

cut TO

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT

Creatures swarm all over the plane The ball turret falls

off A wheel suddenly lowers then falls off A flap flutters
free and blows away Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage

cut TO

THE PILOT

He is fighting the controls Creatures are now in the cockpit
plucking out the instruments The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand

Flying the plane with his good hand he strikes and pummels

at the attacking creatures with the other

cut TO
OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT

It is now almost a flying skeleton For the first time we
see that it is heading for an island A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away

THE PILOT

He falls terror-stricken through space Finally his chute
opens A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away

Jesus H Christ

cut TO

THE ISLAND

The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea bounces
then skims along the wave tops careening up onto the beach
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from whats left of No 3 engine The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No 3

cut TO

THE PILOT

He has landed and is undoing his parachute harness He looks
around incredulously The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts There are many aircrafts both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks The camera pans
to the remains of one machine It is an old American Lockheed
Electra It glints dull in the half light of dawn Painted
on its side are two names Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan
The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap
Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile The
metal arms reach the chrome rod grip it tightly and begin to
lift it up
WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers
AUSTIN
Got it
Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine
he begins to re-solder it in place Behind him a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him
LITTLE GIRL
Its broken again isnt it Daddy
AUSTIN
(concentrating)
Yes dear But Daddys fixing
it (hums)
LITTLE GIRL

(watching)

How come its always breaking

AUSTIN

I dont know sweetheart Mmmmhmm

LITTLE GIRL

When its fixed will you make more
funny pictures for me

AUSTIN

Honey why dont you go play with
your toys and let Daddy finish his
work okay Mmmm

LITTLE GIRL

Okay

The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine
as AUSTIN flips a switch Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize

the glass gates of Kraan

As the image becomes clearer the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen

cut TO

THE GATES OF KRAAN

The Councils voices still ringing in her head TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates Below her the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins

Gliding overtop the deserted streets she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
towns center As she watches the smoke rise she pulls hard
on the reins and heads her bird up

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere In the
center of the room a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering Reaching the floor TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around At the head of

the marble table sits the ELDER - dead In front of him
a roll of parchment lies on the table MTAARNA opens it

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains
their tops glowing green
TAARNA looks at it and puts it in her sack Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand Prying

his stiff fingers apart she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain

Looking at the dead ELDER TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand

cut TO

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING

TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below All is quiet and dark except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window Curious she flies over
pulls up beside the window and climbs in

cut TO

GIRLS BEDROOM

Entering TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor From
within the webbing the green ball is glowing brightly

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack then at the glow
coming from the cocoon Cautiously she approaches the cocoon
sword drawn

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNAs face The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch who emerges from the cocoon cackling through
snake-like fangs

WITCH

Behold The Sphere of Uluhtec

Look upon it Taarna Look upon

it with fear For in its glow lies
the end of heaven - the beginning of
hell Take it Taarna Feel death
in your hands For death is upon
you And as you perish so dies
your race

The witchs eyes go green

WITCH
(screaming)

Take it

She hurls tha ball at TAARNA who dodges it The ball sails
past her out the window Then TAARNA sword raised leaps
at the WITCH slicing through her in rapid strokes

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air and her cackle echoes through
the room

TAARNA backs away climbing out the window onto her bird As
she flies off she sees the WITCHS green ball high above her
rising into the clouds and disappearing

cut TO

SPACE

The WITCHS green ball zooms through space as Earth appears

in the distance Then another object comes into sight Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality soaring high above Earth The green
meteorite passes briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow

The rocketplane banks sharply then stabilizes Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch

Hydraulic metal arms emerge lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane We can see now
that the car is a white 59 Corvette convertible

With a thunk the metal arms release the car and
as the rocketplane blasts away the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth

As the car falls gracefully through space the driver plays
with the wheel causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way then the other

Once his direction is stable the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels until he settles
on one
With the music playing the car falls closer and closer to
Earth entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere In the heat of entry the vehicles paint starts
burning up

As he heads down over a deserted area the driver begins his
approach Touching down at breakneck speed the smoking
Corvette bounces violently every part straining at the
repeated impact

The drivers face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down

TThis accomplished the expressionless driver releases the
chute and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust

EXT THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT

From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and TV newsmen waiting on the front steps

The 59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below and seeing
it the reporters all start to run over

The camera zooms down and into the car Inside the driver
reaches over unplugs a rubber hose and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car As he gets out
the reporters come running up

FEMALE REPORTER
(to driver)

Doctor Anrak six more mutants were
sighted in Arizona this morning Do
you still say this has nothing to do
with the green radiation from space

The driver walks on without speaking

Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff members of

An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters The camera follows him as he sits down next to one

FAT POLITICIAN

whats the Army doing about this
Hell My constiuents are turning
green Theyre growing arms on
their backs Theres something or
someone up there in space and the
voters have a right to know about it

GENERAL

Senator we have no proof that these
mutations are the result of interference

from outer space In fact Doctor Anrak
has just come in so lets hear what he
has to say Doctor

The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up

DOCTOR

First of all there is no cause for

alarm As for the theories of interference
by alien beings it is my firm opinion that
we on Earth are the only intelligent
technically advanced civilization present
in the universe

THE OUTLANDS

All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder Then thud

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTES tattered clothes Then the

burnt ashes of Hanovers body land in a small pile beside his
clothes Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance

cut TO

TAARNA

She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor and enters a magnificent secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock

cut TO

INSIDE TAARNAS HIDEAWAY

Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool Here she disrobes
and picking up a small gold pitcher she pours an ancient oil

over herself It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin

Then she steps into the water where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter

Finishing her sacred bath she steps out and walks to a stone
wall When she touches it a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest TAARNA opens it

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments

so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment Then
as she looks down at the armour the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head

TAARAK
(V0O)

To defend - this is the Pact
but when life loses its value
and it taken for nought then
the Pact is to avenge

Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNAS hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body Finally
we pull back to see her fully

Standing before us glistening in the torch-light she looks
magnificent Reaching once more into the chest TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword As she holds it it seems to vibrate
almost buzzing in her hands Suddenly she swings it slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall As
the burning torch falls to the ground TAARNA leaves

THE SKY

From over our heads TAARNA comes soaring past her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun Below her she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers
Drunken blue men fight in the streets strange animals run
around loose and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters

Looking down amidst the melee she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar The camera zooms in on one of the
creatures saddlebags It has a silver medallion set into the
leather identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elders fingers

INSIDE THE BARROOM

Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap flashy metal outfits
Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and

rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down dump a drink on his
head laugh and kick him

TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors past the three soldiers kicking their victim She sits

walk over to the bar crowding close around TAARNA

Hey look A new one

Taarna slowly stands up pushing their hands away and takes
a step back

BARBARIAN 2

Heey shes tough

BARBARIAN 3

Maybe she wants to fight

They all laugh

BARBARIAN 1

or maybe she wants to take
us all on

Still laughing they move towards her

In a blinding flash TAARNA draws her golden sword and wielding
it like a Samurai master slices off all three of their heads
In an instant the sword is back in its sheath
The barbarians heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground
The music stops and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA

Stepping over the bodies TAARNA walks up to the bartender
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains and

shows it to him The bartender looks at it carefully then
points out the window

BARTENDER

Beyond the oasis

TAARNA nods and leaves

up to some electronic parts on DANS desk

(V0O)

so I brought it up to my room
stuck it in my rock collection and
forgot about it I was experimenting
with natural electricity

The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DANS scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs and many books

In the corner the green ball sits in DANS rock collection
At his desk DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal

THE TRANSFORMATION

We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past

DAN
(V0O)

I felt like I was nothing
- just atoms floating in the
darkness

Then tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner

of the screen The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen Now we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand pages of a book a crumbling
pyramid a green ball

DAN
(V0O)

Then a body started to re-form
around me Only it wasnt my
body - this one had muscles

Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure

Finally a mans face takes shape and as it forms eveything
gets brighter and clearer

DAN
(V0O)

It was a great body but I
wasnt too crazy about the
face
The powerful figure DEN turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms Moving his mouth he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful

Hmmm no hair

Suddenly the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID

DEN strong masculine and hairless materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol He is naked and unconscious
Above him the glowing green ball is held in the idols other
hand

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck stop a huge truncated pyramid The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water

Kneeling all around the seething pool are lizard-men wearing
priests robes Two of them stand beside a glass coffin Inside
the coffin lies a naked girl bound and gagged

PRIESTS

Directly in fron of the idol a regal-looking QUEEN wearing
a revealing velvet cloak is praying to the raging water

looks down and notices his enormous genitals

DEN

Hmmm big

Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself

Thank you

She takes DENS hand and lies back in the flower her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight

DAN
(V0O)

She had the most beautiful eyes

I wanted to make some conversation
but I found my new self asking the
same old stupid questions

DEN

Are you from around here

GIRL

Well you may not believe this but
Im from another world - from a place
called Earth

DEN

Earth I too am from Earth
How did you get here

GIRL

My name is Katherine Wells and

Im from the British colony of
Gibraltar Time makes no diff-
erence here but there it was

the summer of 1892 It was

evening - Id gone for a walk on
the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
fell from the sky Following its
glow I came to a shining gate made
out of light Unable to resist I
stepped through it and awoke in
this world There I was thin and
weakly fit only to stay indoors
(she stands up)
But here somehow I am stronger
more alive
(she stretches seductively)

more fully a woman

DAN
(V0O)

Youre not kidding

DEN
(standing)

I too seem better equipped on
this world

(he holds out his arm)

My arms are more powerful
(strecthes his fingers)

Even my fingers seem to hold
great strength

KATHERINE walks up close to DEN takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast

KATHERINE

You saved my life I have no
reward to give you but if any
part of me pleases your senses
- I would give it willingly

She circles her nipple with his baby finger

DAN
(V0O)

Wow This was great There was
no way Id get a chick like this
back on Earth I mean look at
her

Taking KATHERINE in his arms DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her

DAN
(V0O)

There was only one problem

A spiked boot appears in the frame The camera pans up to
show a large ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE

The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple
completely surrounded by a horde of grim bestial warriors

DAN
(VO

were but they sure picked a
bad time to show up

ARDS THRONE ROOM

the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room

DAN
(V0O)

They split us up and took me to
this weird castle-type place

I wanted to find out where theyd
taken Katherine but none of these
guys seemed to speak English

In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it On the throne sits ARD a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye
ARD
They tell me you are Den of Earth

the one who dared to steal the
female sacrifice from the Queen

DAN
(V0)
This guy was a shrimp so I figured
Id play it tough
DEN

Where is the girl

ARD

I am Ard - supreme leader of
the revolution and the next
ruler of the world

DEN

The girl

ARD

Well arent we fierce

If you are truly as tough as
you seem then you will serve
me well But first a test
Guards Castrate him

DAN
(V0)
Uh oh
Two bestial guards approach from behind brandishing curved

short-swords DEN turns instinctively dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beasts head
crushing his skull
Spinning with his own momentum DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guards chest snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room
Without pausing the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun butts it into the
creatures groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captains jaw
The creature crumples leaving DEN with the gun
DAN
(V0)
Boy I was pretty good at this
stuff
ARD
Excellent You are worthy to
serve me
DEN
(aiming machine-gun at him)
Give me the girl or die
ARD
(taking it lightly)
Well if I have a choice Ill
take death
DEN
So be it
DEN fires spraying a row of bullets across ARDS body The

bullets blast big yellow holes in ARDS chest but there is
no blood ARD looks up and laughs
Ha ha ha Youll have to
do better than that

As DEN looks on ARDS wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over

DAN
(V0O)

I could see why they made this
guy their leader

ARD
(standing up)
but if youre really interested

in the girl Ive had her encased in
glass

ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE unconscious sealed inside

DEN

Shes dead

ARD

Actually no Shes sleeping
but only I can awaken her

DEN

What do you want of me

ARD

I want you to steal the sacred
Loc-Nar

DEN
What is this Loc-Nar

ARD
The Queens glowing sphere you
fool The sacrifice to Uluhtec
can only be performed by the
possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar

(calling out)
Norl

NORL a huge gorilla-man in a purple cloak steps forward

ARD
(to Den)

This is Norl my bravest warrior
You will go with him to the Queens
castle and steal the Loc-Nar Then
I will give you the girl

DEN

And if I refuse

ARD

If you refuse you die she dies

the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own

DEN

What are they saying

NORL
They talk of the savage beast who
prowls these catacombs with a fierce
hunger and sharp teeth

six inches long

A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL

NORL

Sorry

glow of the green ball casts a pale light

KORG

Loc-Nar

DAN
(V0O)

Wow It was just like the
ball I dug up in my back yard

They tip-toe towards it

DAN
(V0O)

As I saw the Loc-Nars glow I

had this real funny feeling All
by themselves my hands reached
forward to touch it But the
Loc-Nar moved out of the way
Instead my hands felt something
else - warm flesh Then the lights
came on

In the brightly lit room DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN and holding her firm naked breasts in his hands
Looking around he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queens ugly guards swords raised

DAN
(V0)
Talk about embarassing
QUEEN
(smiling)

Kill them
The Queens guards attack with battle-axes clubs and swords
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into anothers
face four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out
But DEN still going strong throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window As the QUEEN watches with
glee more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Dens throat
CAPTAIN
Can I slit his throat your
Majesty

The QUEEN eyeing Dens magnificent body sighs

QUEEN

Yes slit his throat

CAPTAIN

Thank you your Majesty

As the Captain presses his knife against Dens flesh the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand

QUEEN
(smiling)

Stop I have ah something better
in mind

She takes Dens hand and leads him into an adjoining room as
the guards grumble to one another

In the same instant a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky
striking the idol full force The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain into the water Suddenly the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar

Holding onto the Loc-Nar ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp The

troops stop fighting and look on in amazement until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar hanging in mid-air

cut TO

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID

The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere
which lies abandoned on the ground The soldiers are gone As
we watch time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball The earth heaves
and shifts and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern
Fascinated he picks it up and looks at it as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down crushing him

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton and

a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball In the
fire-light the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals

when one of the camels paws at the ground uncovering the glowing
ball Scared the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks slaughtering the tribesmen

Time accelerates again and the conquering Romans build a temple
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched while slave-girls feed them grapes
As the ball glows the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans covering them and the green ball in rubble

Over the ruins of the temple a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village
Satisfied with his work he lowers the bucket to draw himself

a drink Behind him an ox-cart comes roaring around a corner
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town It is evening and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green

Moving in through a window across the street we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green until the
woman who looks like a high-class harlot finishes dressing and
leaves her room Crossing the street she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well

The gentleman gets out of his carriage approaches the woman

and propositions her She smiles touches and teases him We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball and the womans
body falls to the ground The camera pans up to the well-bucket
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands

As time begins to move forward again the man ages and hobbles
away as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up covering the green ball The town becomes
dirtier and blacker and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky Almost on cue the doors of the houses open and grim
coal-miners emerge shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter A rat appears
Panning back up the street is now empty A bell is heard
ringing and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view Masked workers follow the cart One rings

the bell while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight

A support snaps and one of the buildings starts to collapse
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball As the ball hits the ground it is covered
over by rubble

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier Sand blows all around covering over everything
As the sandstorm clears the entire terrain is nothing but
desert In the distance we can see a group of people walking

cut TO
PEOPLE

The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector As
he walks his detector starts bleeping He points to a spot

on the ground and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels

One of the workers finds something

WORKER

The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot The shovel-sifter digs

in and pulls up a large chunk of desert When the sand has
sifted out we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machines grip
t is not glowing The machine swivels and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifters teeth

As the foreman touches it the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly
The foremans hands turn green He looks at his green hands
then he looks over to the archaeologist Suddenly the foremans
entire body glows green and crumbles into dust

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
