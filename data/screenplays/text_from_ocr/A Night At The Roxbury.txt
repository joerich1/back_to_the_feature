piece of glass you could put over the

floor And it would be really sweet
because people would feel like they
were dancing on water

DOUG
And you could put fish in the water
and it would be like the ocean

STEVE
Or Doug you know what would be
another amazing idea You could have
a special room for people who want to
dance naked

DOUG
Plus then you could have a room next
to that room with a one-way mirror so
other people could watch them
