TWO MOONS SIT HIGH IN THE NIGHT SKY MERE MOMENTS FROM 1
A FULL ECLIPSE

EXT DARK FOREST NIGHT 2

SOMEWHERE we see the racing footsteps of FOUR HORSES
through the trees The sound of a thunderous stampede

SOMEWHERE ELSE
A HOODED WITCH looks to the moons and spins around

HOODED WITCH
The TIME IS NIGH

A COVEN OF HOODED WITCHES have formed a circle in the
forest A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN is thrown on to a stone alter
She’s terrified her hands bound

THE WITCHES begin chanting as an EVIL LOOKING WARLOCK
drops a LARGE CHALICE and enters the circle wiping the
remaining liquid from his mouth smiling a toothy grin at
the screaming maiden

WARLOCK
It has been one hundred years
since these two moons have
aligned Tonight under their glow
I will fulfill the ANCIENT
PROPHECY And darkness shall
return to the land as it did one
thousand years ago

The Hooded Witches hiss with delight The Warlock strokes
the frightened maiden’s face

WARLOCK (CONTD)
Be not afraid my dear This is
your destiny You will bear my
dark seed giving birth to a new
age An age of destruction An age
where I rule the universe

THWIP Out of no where An arrow with a glowing tip finds
its mark through the center of his open mouth With a
surprised look on his face the Warlock drops dead

The WITCHES turn as a BAND OF GOLDEN KNIGHTS emerge from
the forest and climb from their horses Their ARCHERS
taking aim on the HOODED HAGS

The WITCHES scream but it’s too late arrows quickly
cutting each down in unison The Maiden can barely
believe her eyes as all her captors suddenly lie died

around waist height and then pretends to get an air blow
job from his measurement

Tumblebottom takes insult and puts his hand on his sword

the creature He fought hard but I
fought harder Laying him to waste
with my blade But I must not take
credit for this victory alone For
I never would have found the

Spending all of her life in
captivity has left her unaware of
a lot of our customs orjust
things in general

wearing that dress

The lion picks up Belladonna and confuses her as he tries
to dance with her

Thadeous steps out with a whip to dance and tame as the
ringmaster of the performance A random yet somehow
impressive spectacle

Thadeous and Courtney are eating a feast with the elves
He is coming down off his drunken high Thadeous stomps
around their small cabin breaking things

THADEOUS
Ever since Mother died I’ve
gotten the short end up the royal
shasta Aye My father refuses to
see the good in me Instead he
looks to Fabious the laziest
drunkest most disrepectful
arrogant cockheadedest prick ANY
royal kingdom has EVER seen I
mean really WHAT IN THE FUCK

Thadeous collapses in devastated frustration
Tumblebottom consoles him

INT ROYAL COURTYARD - DAY 21
The song ends The lovers look into each others eyes

Simon the mechanical crow flies around the crowd He
CAWS and goes ape shit Everyone turns

Up the aisle the Blind Gypsy pulls his wagon THE GOLDEN
BOX shimmering in the sunlight The Gypsy has attracted
the attention of all The crowd falls quiet

BLIND GYPSY
Greetings I am looking for the
great Prince Fabious and his
beautiful bride to be

The crowd murmurs The King looks to his son and shakes
his head with an understanding smile

KING TALLIOUS
I’m sorry old man but now is not
the time Run along We’re still
in the midst of a ceremony

The Gypsy bows embarrassed

The King motions to his Knights

KING TALLIOUS
Help our guest with his wagon

BLIND GYPSY

In one swift motion the figure rips off his cloak
revealing his true identity Decked out in a wizard robe
a skull cap and wearing some serious Siegfried and Roy

THE ROYAL KNIGHTS unsheathe their swords and approach
Leezar who chuckles twirling a SLEEK JEWELED STAFF

King Tallious do you really think

stop me You should know better
MOPHINDUS

Leezar spins his staff sending a BOLT at the approaching
Knights They all DROP THEIR SWORDS and DOUBLE OVER in
agonizing pain

The Royal Guard writhe on the ground as Leezar saunters
past them across the stage caressing his staff

FABIOUS
How dare you show your foul face
here on the happiest day of my
life

LEEZAR
How dare I I only come to reclaim

Nothing here belongs to you
Leezar except your stinking
heart And for disrupting my

watch it expire

The remaining Royal Knights unsheathe their swords and
join the Prince Leezar chuckles at the display

Leezar spins his staff sending a BLUE BALL OF ELECTRIC
MAGIC right for The King Fabious swings his blade
deflects the ball and sends it back at Leezar who jumps
as it explodes beneath him

LEEZAR
Well look at you

“KING TALLIOUS

alone and leave my Kingdom

LEEZAR
Or what Perhaps I’ll die at the
blade of Prince Fabious

FABIOUS

thief You come into my lair and
you take what belongs to me You
steal from my home You’ take MY
TRUE LOVE BELLADONNA

BELLADONNA
I AM NOT YOUR LOVE

FABIOUS
No one has love for you Leezar
And when I end you here today I’d

The GOLDEN BOX then opens and out crawls a RED ROBED
WITCH followed by another and another and another

We join our son in his decent into
darkness and his rise to power

The WITCHES begin shooting BOLTS of ELECTRICITY at
Fabious and the rest of the Knights sending them flying
into the air spinning Fabious is knocked unconscious

The crowd goes nuts screaming and running total mayhem
In the midst of it all LEEZAR SNATCHES BELLADONNA

LEEZAR
Here we are Brought together in
these chains of love

Belladonna lets out a scream The witches shriek as
their magic sets the courtyard ablaze Through the smoke-

KING TALLIOUS
Enough Mothers and spawn of the
dark realm Leave MY Kingdom

The KING whips up a crossbow taken from a fallen guard
He lets an arrow fly speeding right for LEEZAR when--

Leezar slams the ground with his staff sending out a
SONIC BOOM The speeding arrow explodes in the blast The
King is blown off the stage and carried off screaming by
his secret service-like GUARDS

Leezar ROARS in pain dropping Belladonna Through his
gut we see the TIP OF A SWORD is sticking out Behind
him with singed hair is Fabious with his grip tight and
pressing his sword right through Leezar He withdraws his
blade and steps back grabbing Belladonna

Leezar looks down to the deep deadly woundand then in
mere seconds the wound closes up and heals itself

Fabious and Belladonna’s eyes go wide Leezar looks up to
them and giggles

ZAP-- Fabious is frozen in place from the powerful glow
of Leezar’s staff

Belladonna screams in HORROR LEEZAR BINDS HER with
colorful energy coils

The coils bring her right to ground below him He holds
her by the hair pulls the dagger from his back and then
licks his own blood from the blade

‘The ROBED WITCHES climb back into the golden box one by

Leezar sticks his tongue in Belladonna’s ear and snaps

LEEZAR
Didn’t I just say this sort of
thing can’t hurt me Shame Your
anger for me clouds your
judgement But it’s not your
fault I locked you in here alone
for all those years Never showing
you attention nor love Why
wouldn’t you want to leave or stab
a dinner utensil through my hand

will pay you more attention When
we fulfill the prophecy together I
hope that it can be an act of love

dances and tosses his long hair around

Fabious makes a graceful rampage approach as he runs and
leaps off a rock tumbles on the ground uses his leg to
sweep the leg out from under Dastardly He quickly grabs
one of his swords and gets to his feet Dastardly finds
his stance as well and the fight is on

No I mean yes I have courted
ladies I never got to fuck

FABIOUS
Oh-

COURTNEY
I worked as a Squire for the
Emperor Chief of Xaxxon A savage
tribe in the heart of the jungles
His daughter had the most
beautiful afro and a skin with the
sweet glaze of honey At night
she would sneak down to the
boweries knock on my window and
we would whisper for hours of a
life where love was simple and our
feelings were true

FABIOUS
And were you afraid to go all the
way Or just-

COURTNEY
Previous to my engagements she
had relations with a certain
Marquis who was known throughout
the land for his genital fungus
twisted sex games and a legendary
fire breathing cock Also I had
heard she had a vagina with teeth
Some pockets of life I’ve pledged
best remain as mysteries

Taken aback by this passionate but brief confession

FABIOUS
So It was more out of
precaution and sanitation than any
true moral character on your
behalf

COURTNEY
Yeah I just really didn’t want my
prick to fall off

Thadeous snores loudly They both turn to look at him
FABIOUS
Look at him sleeping like an

angel Ah I have spent a lifetime
often envious of my brother

through the fog

The boat then bumps onto land The fog clears
revealing

LEEZAR’S LAIR a talland large castle made of BLACK ROCK
many towers and spires reach into the heavens There is
a gate made of SHRUBBERY surrounding a large WOODEN DOOR

Thadeous sizes up TWO GUARDS that stand at the gate and
without hesitation he takes The Blade of Unicorns and
impales them He kicks the door in

From the FAR END of the PATH they hear a loud GROWL

The minotaur stops to listen hearing nothing but their
own breath

Then Thadeous appears from around the corner in front of

As best as his battered body can Simon FLIES ABOVE THE

Thadeous rounds a corner in his pursuit and sees THE

Courtney screams

OH GODS The beast is upon us Run

The MINOTAUR COUGHS as he grooves Thadeous can’t stop
watching the beast’s animal thrusts

In a moment Thadeous closes his eyes and concentrates
He summons the power of the Blade of the Unicorn and
screams as he runs toward the beast He raises the SWORD
and slams it down INTO THE MINOTAUR’S BACK The beast
SCREAMS and drops DEAD before them

All falls quiet It’s like the tape just melted in the
middle of your favorite heavy metal jam
