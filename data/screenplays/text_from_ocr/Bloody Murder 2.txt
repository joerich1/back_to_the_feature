yearseveral of the counselors
got this half-assed plan to get
back at them But things got out
of control and before they knew
it Trevor was at the bottom of a
ravine half dead with his face
eaten by hungry birds

JAMES
What happened to him

RYAN
Well naturally

hospital Medical at first then
mental His face was so badly
disfigured that he always wore a
mask

RYAN
Yeah how did you know
JAMES
Every summer camp has a Trevor
Moorehouse Here let me see At
some point he was either released
or he broke out of the mental
hospital Then its said that he
returned to Camp Placid Pines to
forever seek out his revenge on
the place and the peoplethat
did this to him Howd I do

RYAN

just some fictitious local
psychopath to get campers into bed
