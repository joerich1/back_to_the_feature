INT ROOM - NIGHT

A computer screen glows in the depth of the room lighting up
the tiny area from which it sits Another light illuminating
the room is a fish tank sitting at the back corner
underneath a few shelves sitting on metal racks holding it

up

There’s a tiny map on a pin board of the Roman Empire era
Pictures cover the map except for one spot The uncovered
spot is part of the key of the map with a box colored orange
and next to it saying Roman Empire 180 AD

The fish swim in circles through the bubbles racing up
towards the surface stirring up the water Sitting on the
shelves above the fish tank are tiny model cars

The windows are closed curtains are shut halfway showing
that it’s dark and calm outside A light breeze flows through
the room blowing the curtains The breeze moves towards the
back of the room where the computer sits on a large wooden
desk

The wind blows a bouncy ball sitting on a few books onto the
keyboard on the ‘Enter’ button The mouse had been clicked on
the Internet Explorer icon and once the bouncy ball lands on
the enter button it opens the Internet opening up to the
homepage

The homepage shows numerous amounts of information such as
the weather E-mails and a calendar marked with events
There is a section titled “This day in history” Beneath it
the top event is titled “Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapses”
with a brief description about it beneath it

A magazine sits on the desk next to the keyboard The breeze
blows it open the pages flipping over rather quickly The
breeze stops it at a certain page showing the Golden Gate
Bridge with a hole smack dab in the middle of it The sun in
the picture casts a fiery glow over it

The breeze continues to blow through the room ruffling
papers and stirring dust One of the bolts loosens from the
racks holding the shelf with the model cars up The bolt
falls out and lands in the fish tank where the fish begin
nipping at it in curiosity

A model of a skeleton hangs in another corner of the room by
a piece of string twisting back and forth an evil grin on
its face Car lights shine through one of the windows and
the light crawls across the wall The light hits the
skeleton casting a shadow—but it’s not the skeleton’s
shadow It’s in the form of Death with a scythe in its hand
Another breeze comes through the room The rack holding the
shelf with model cars breaks off the wall landing in the
fish tank The end of the shelf lands on the edge of the
tank the model cars rolling into the water splashing water
out of the tank The fish innocently nip at them

The splashing wakes up a teenage boy his hair sticking up in
different places and bags under his eyes This is TYLER DAILY He grunts while sitting up staring at the fish tank
Groaning he stands up and walks to the fish tank scratching
his head and rubbing his eyes

Squatting down he looks at the fish who are now swimming
joyfully through the water not giving a care about the toy
cars anymore He taps the tank and the fish jump but
continue swimming

The breeze once again runs that area of the room blowing
Tyler’s long hair Tyler looks at his windows confused since
they are shut He sniffs and pulls the shelf off the tank and
sets it down on the chair

Tyler walks back to his bed and plumps down on it almost
immediately falling back asleep And suddenly it’s

CUT TO
Daytime
Tyler still in the same position as when he fell on the bed
wakes up blinded by the light He gets out of his bed and

stretches letting out a big long yawn

He quickly gets dressed gets his hair neat before somebody
knocks at his door

TYLER
Hold one second

The knocking continues Tyler lets out an irritated sigh and
walks to the door

TYLER (CONTD)
I said hold on—

He opens the door and sees WES PRICE his black hair
spiked up a very dark green jacket baggy pants and black
hobo gloves

WES
That’s was more than a second
TYLER
(Letting him in)
How’d you even get in my house

WES
Your mom let me in Hurry up and
get your bag

TYLER
Don’t start making this a habit
She’s not going to let you in every
time you knock on the door Why are
you even here

WES
I need a ride

TYLER
What happened to your crap-mobile

WES
The engine’s dead The damn thing’s
a pile of shit

Tyler makes one last touch to his hair

WES (CONTD)
Will you stop grooming and get your
things ready

TYLER
God you sound like my mom Hold
on

He turns off the bathroom light and grabs his backpack
hanging it over his shoulder They walk out

INT KITCHEN - DAY

ERIN DAILY silky brown hair and looks young for her
age sits at the table with coffee in on hand and a newspaper
in the other Tyler and Wes walk in

ERIN
There’re biscuits on the counter
with some sausage Wes you can
help yourself to anything

WES
Thanks Mrs Daily
TYLER
Where’s Dad

ERIN
He had to go to work early Eat

Tyler takes a biscuit and two sausages kisses his mom
goodbye and walks out the door but she stops them

ERIN (CONTD)
That’s not you’re having is it

TYLER
Mom we’re going to be late

ERIN
You have 45 minutes until school
starts

TYLER

Yeah but still it’s better than
being too late isn’t it

Erin gives a playful glare to Tyler She shrugs

ERIN
I hate you

TYLER
It’s because I’m your son isn’t it

ERIN
Ill see you after school

WES
By Mrs Daily

She waves to them as they shut the door

EXT HOUSETRUCK

Tyler unlocks the truck and the two get inside

INT TRUCK
Wes looks at Tyler as he starts the car
WES

What’s with the bags under your
eyes
TYLER
I havent been getting enough sleep
lately due to school And last
night I woke up finding the model
cars my dad used to buy me in my
fish tank

WES
Shit man Sucks for you

As tyler pulls out of the driveway he begins flipping
through his CDs in the CD player He comes across one where
he thinks his music but the child’s song “London Bridge Is
Falling Down” begins to play

Tyler stares at the CD player focused mainly on that Wes
looking out the side of the truck jumps

WES (CONT’D)
Watch out

Tyler slams on the brakes as a car zooms by behind the truck
having to swerve to avoid an accident honking Tyler watches
the car fly down the road

WES (CONTD)
Dumbass drivers
(Rolls down window)
This is a neighborhood you
shithead

Wes rolls the window back up and looks at Tyler whose hands
are still gripping the steering wheel tightly and “London
Bridge is Falling Down” continues to play

WES (CONTD)
Hey man you all right You gotta
watch out for those kind of people

TYLER
Yeah I’m fine I just zoned out

WES
You want me to drive

TYLER
Yeah over my dead body

Tyler backs all the way out of the driveway and rides down
the street
WES
So um when are we listening to
another song

Tyler realizes the London Bridge song is still playing and he
quickly changes it to the radio

TYLER
Sorry my mom sometimes drives the
truck with my little sister so she
usually puts in this CD to soothe
both of them down after a hard
day’s work

WES
It sucks having a 3-year-old sister
doesn’t it

TYLER
It sucks major ass

The song on the radio ends and the DJ comes on

RADIO DJ
Okay time for our traffic report
for you devils on the road There
has been a major pile up on Route
14 and a stall on Burton

TYLER
Crap we aren’t going to make it to
school on time if we take Barton

WES
There’s another way I mean it’s a
little longer but we’ll be there 5
minutes before school starts

TYLER
Where

WES
Mason Bridge You know where that
is right

TYLER
Yeah

Tyler takes a left turn He comes to the end of the
neighborhood street that opens up to the highway Cars zoom
by and Tyler continually watches them go by waiting for a

gap
A red Viper with its hood down stops next to Tyler’s truck in
the right turn lane Two girls are sitting in it laughing

WES
Look who it is

Tyler looks out his window looking at DAISY WREN and
LESLIE HOPE Leslie honks looking at Tyler and Wes
Daisy looks over and smiles Tyler rolls his window down

TYLER

Hey girls How’s it going
DAISY

Hey Ty
TYLER

Please don’t call me that

DAISY
Why not Tyler’s too old-fashion
Oh hey do you know what Friday
is

WES
The day you start another period

DAISY
Only you would like that Wes But
no Friday’s my birthday

LESLIE
You gonna get her something
special Tyler

Tyler looks for a gap but sees none He looks back at the
girls

TYLER
Maybe I might even plan something
big out for her

DAISY
You don’t have to get me anything
TylerUnless you want to get me
something

WES
A restraining order

DAISY

LESLIE

TYLER

Mason Bridge We’ll get there
faster than Burton

LESLIE
Are you sure

WES
If you want to sit in traffic for
half an hour you can go right on
ahead

Tyler sees a large gap He takes it and Leslie follows right
behind Tyler looks up at his rearview mirror and sees Leslie
and Daisy right behind them

RADIO DJ
All right let’s start our morning
with a little bit of country Hit
it

Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire” begins to play and Wes turns it
up

EXT BRIDGE - DAY

Two patrol cars sit on the side of the road along with an
ambulance and two cars that have smashed into each other
Tyler at the front of the line stops as an officer holds up
a stop sign to him while the traffic on the opposite side
drive past the wreck slowly

Tyler stares at the wreckage One of the cars front had been
crushed in like a can while the other one’s side looks like
crumpled up paper

There’s a knock on Wes’s window They turn and see CARA
BROOKE and TUCKER VELASCO both on their bikes Wes
rolls down the window and Cara smiles

CARA
Hey guys

WES
A bike
TUCKER
(Pointing to traffic)
This is why we avoid driving cars
Besides drivers respect bikers

WES
Sure whatever you say

CARA
Hey Tyler did you get the homework
for history and astronomy I had a
doctor’s appointment and I missed
those two classes

WES
For what Soccer

CARA
I had to get a physical It sucked

TYLER
Yeah I’1l help you during lunch

CARA
Thanks a bunch
(To Tucker)
Hey I’1l meet you at the bridge
later I’1l get us a smoothie at
the park drink stand

TUCKER
Okay babe See yah

They kiss and the officer flips the sign to the side that
says “Slow” Tucker and Cara back away

TUCKER (CONT’D)
See you all at school

Tucker begins riding his bike past the wreckage and heads on
towards the bridge Cara rides her bike through the grass as
she heads into the park

The bridge is a gigantic structure with a long drop to the
bottom where a river flows below The bridge shakes a little
as the winds begin to pick up and the metal supports creak

Before Tyler pulls onto the bridge a car speeds around them
on the shoulder passing in front of them Tyler slams on his
breaks causing Leslie to stop

TYLER
What the fuck

WES
That’s the guy who almost hit you
earlier this morning

TYLER
Jesus Christ

WES
Forget about it There’s a line of
cars up ahead so he’s not going to
be able to go anywhere

Ahead of them is a stop light at the end of the bridge and
about four cars wait in front of it

Cars on the other lane begin to build up due to the fact that
the officer had let too many cars come around the wreck
behind Tyler The officers get into a mess and try to keep
everything calm while trying to slowly let the cars pass

JOHNNY CASH
‘IT fell into a burning ring of
fire I went down down down and
the flames went higher’

Tucker gets onto the bridge and goes a few yards before
stopping and looking back waiting for Cara He breathes
heavily and takes a chug of water from his water bottle

INT CAR

In the speeding car DEREK ROSS dressed in a collared
shirt and khakis with his hair combed neatly sits chewing on
his fingernails He slams his fist on the steering wheel and
looks at his watch

DEREK
Come on Damn it

Below the bridge the cement the supports are in begin to
crackle and fall apart The creaking metal gets louder The
bridge shifts position shaking the cars

INT TRUCK

Tyler and Wes become alert

WES
What was that

INT VIPER

Leslie and Daisy look around Daisy unbuckles and stands up
The metal creaking continues

DAISY
You hear that

EXT BRIDGE

Beneath the cement blocks break apart completely and the
supports collapse along with the land beneath it The end of
the bridge sinks beneath the earth and breaks making the
bridge slanted All the cars roll back into wall of dirt

Leslie’s Viper pops up rolling over the tiny car behind it
Daisy falls over the windshield and onto the hood She falls
on her back her head hanging over the edge

Tucker hangs onto the railings as his bike flies over the
edge and plunges into the water below

The cars continue to roll back and Tyler’s truck rolls back
faster than the others

Tyler can’t stop his truck Before Daisy can react the truck
smashes into Leslie’s Viper smashing Daisy’s head brain and
skull fragments spray on the back of the truck and on the
ground

Large metal supports on top of the bridge begin to collapse
landing on cars smashing them into the pavement One care
explodes as a support crushes it

INT TRUCK
Wes jumps out of the car slamming the door shut

TYLER
Wes Wes no

Wes runs in front of the truck but Derek’s smashes into his
right leg Wes doubles over as his leg is crush to pulp and
Derek’s trunk flies open As doubles over the top half of
his body sticks into the trunk

A support structure is dislodged from the bridge and falls
down onto the trunk of Derek’s car slicing Wes’s body in
half His legs fall back blood and organs spilling out of
what is left of him

The bridge begins to crack in half and pieces of the bridge
begin to break off taking cars with them The bridge begins
to lean sideways and all the cars sliding to one side
doesn’t help but make it lean to the side even further

Derek’s car slides across the road and hits the side of the
bridge a sharp piece of metal from the bridge piercing
through the door inches away from Derek Cars begin to flip
over the side of the bridge

Leslie falls out of her Viper She slides across the pavement
and her Viper and another car slide into her practically
crushing her She screams in pain as blood begins to pour
from her mouth The bridge railing breaks and she falls off
along with her car and a few others

She splashes in the water with her Viper immediately landing
on her right after

Tyler’s truck begins to slide sideways towards Derek’s As
Derek tries opening the door to get out Tyler’s truck slams
into his knocking Derek back and getting him impaled on the
piece of metal Shards of glass get stuck in his face as they
fly at him

Tucker continues to hang onto the railing but can’t and
lets go He slides down towards the other side of the bridge
and hangs onto a car One of the edges of the car gets caught
onto his pant legs

The railing on the other side of the bridge can’t support of
the weight of the car and snaps The car plunges towards the
depth of the river taking Tucker with it A railing pole
still intact with the bridge goes between Tucker’s legs He’s
ripped in half from the crotch up as the car pulls him
through the pole

The bridge can’t take it any long The whole thing begins to
fall apart The supports break off and fall into the water
The cars begin splashing into the water drowning whoever
were in them The bridge breaks in half and Tyler’s truck
slips through the crack

He screams as the water gets nearer and nearer The truck
smashes into the water the windshield shatters water
pouring in immediately Tyler screams underwater bubbles
flowing out of his mouth

He swims out of the windshield and swims up towards the
surface dodging sinking debris He comes up out of the
water immediately staring up The bridge is coming down at
him part of it on fire along with cars and dead bodies

Tyler has no time to scream as he

CUT TO

EXT BRIDGE

Wakes up eyes darting in every direction perspiring
heavily and breathing as if he just got done running

CARA
Hey Tyler did you get the homework
for history and astronomy I had a
doctor’s appointment and I missed
those two classes

WES
For what Soccer

CARA
I had to get a physical It sucked

Tyler looks in front of him The officer turns the stop sign
to where it says “Slow”

CARA (CONT’D)
Tyler

TYLER
Holy shit

WES
Dude drive

TYLER
No no no we can’t go on that
bridge

WES
Um yeah we can

CARA
Tyler are you okay

Behind them Leslie honks

TYLER
No we can’t go on that bridge If
we go on that bridge we’re all
going to die

TUCKER
What the fuck man Don’t mess
around like that

Tyler looks in front of him The officer motions him to drive
with an irritated expression on his face

TYLER
I’m not joking I saw it happen
The bridge is going to collapse I
saw everyone die

CARA
Tyler calm down

TYLER
We have to stop everyone from going
on that bridge

The officer walks up to Tyler’s truck
WES
Dude what the fuck is wrong with

you

Behind them Leslie continues to honk

INT CAR
Derek looks out his window and sees Tyler’s stalled truck

DEREK
What the hell

EXT BRIDGE

Tyler storms out of his truck where the officer tries to calm
him down

TYLER
You have to stop the people up
there from going up the bridge

OFFICER
Okay okay calm downWhat
happened here

TYLER
I saw the bridge collapse I saw it
in my headEverything was on
fire I saw everyone die

WES
He hasn’t gotten enough sleep
lately It was probably just a
dream he had

TYLER
No it wasn’t a dream I’m serious

LESLIE
Tyler are you okay

DAISY
Baby What’s going on

Derek gets out of his car and yells at the officer and Tyler

DEREK
Can you just let us pass this fuck
head I have a job interview in
ten minutes and my job is on the
other side of town

OFFICER
(To Derek)
Sir calm down we will get this
situated I need you to step aside
and let these other cars through

DEREK
I don’t even know these people Why
the hell should I get over

OFFICER
Sir just do what I say

Derek steps aside and the officer motions the other cars to
pass

OFFICER (CONTD)
(To Tyler)
Okay just pull your vehicle to the
side of the road and explain to me
what happened—

TYLER
No you can’t let anybody on that
bridge

OFFICER

I’m going to need you to calm—

TYLER
Just listen to me God damn it

There’s a loud crashing sound and everyone’s attention is
turned to the bridge The metal supports collapse and the
sound of bending metal and smashing glass can be heard The
whole bridge collapses and splashes into the water

The officer runs to his patrol car leaving Tyler standing
out of his truck his mouth agape and his eyes wide

DAISY
Oh my God

Derek steps towards his car cautiously but doesn’t get in
it Tyler runs a few feet towards the direction of the
bridge pulling at his hair but stops tears flowing from
his eyes and turns around He turns back and looks at where
the bridge used to be but is now nothing but smoke

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT ROOM - NIGHT

Tyler paces across his room Messages left on his phone ring
in his head

DAISY (0S)
HeyTyTylerI was just
seeing if you wanted to talk I
mean I don’t want whatever
happened earlier today to freak you
out for the rest of your life

(Beat)
If you want to talk you can always
call me

Beep Another message comes in Tyler looks at a picture of
him and an older boy that looks like him It’s Tyler’s older
brother

CARA (0OS)
Look I know you probably don’t want
to talk now but I’m calling to
tell you that whenever you do want
to tell me something you can
always call me I just don’t want
this thing to change our lifestyle
II guess I’ll see you at school

Beep There’s a knock at Tyler’s door He turns and sees his
mom peek in

ERIN
How’s it going

Tyler looks down at his feet he sits down on his bed as Erin
walks to him with a cup of water and a sleeping pill in her
hand

ERIN (CONTD)
Here take this

He puts the pill in his mouth and drinks half of the water
Erin begins rubbing Tyler’s shoulders breathe deeply

TYLER
I don’t even know what happened
Mom I wasn’t able to comprehend
anything Everything was moving too
fast and when I finally realized
what was going onIt was too
late

Erin stops rubbing his shoulders He turns to her

TYLER (CONTD)

And now after this everyones
going to look at me differently
like I’m a freak

ERIN
Wes told me you haven’t been able
to sleep It was probably just a
dream that turned to be a
coincidence

TYLER
A coincidence It wasn’t a dream
Mom You don’t know what I saw
what I smelled what I feltBut
what I want to know was if it
wasn’t a dreamwhat was it

INT LIBRARY — DAY
Wes and Tyler walk through aisles full of books and carts
TYLER

If it wasn’t a dream then what was
it

WES
I don’t know man I didn’t see
what you saw All I saw was you
freaking out and then it happened

TYLER
How did it happen How was I able
to see it happen when nobody else
could

Wes pulls a book off a shelf

WES
I guess that’s another one of
Life’s mysteries

TYLER

Look I’m serious about all of this
I’m scared and I know you are and I
know Daisy is and I know everyone
is

WES
I didn’t say anything about it
being a joke

He pulls another book off the shelf

WES (CONTD)
Okay so I’m going trust you and
drop the part about it being a
dream So what was it then A
vision Are you psychic

TYLER
It hasn’t happened to me before Or
at least something that real

WES
So it was sort of like a
premonition maybe Something you
see before it happens It’s sort of
like a dream except it actually
does happen just the way you
visioned it

TYLER
So you’re saying that what I had
was a premonition

WES
I don’t know Tyler I don’t know as
much as you do about this

TYLER
Well at least you know something
Do premonitions just come randomly
or what

Wes searches the shelf and pulls out a specific book titled
“Psychics Premonitions Visions and Dreams”

WES
Look in there and tell me what it
says

Tyler flips through the pages and searches for premonitions

TYLER
‘Premonition refers to a situation
when future events are foreknown or
forecast Premonitions are usually
treated as a result of paranormal
or supernatural feat’ So a ghost
gave me the vision

WES
Apparently some supernatural force
gave it to you

TYLER
But why

WES
Hey I’m no expert at this myth
mumbo-jumbo

TYLER
Wes I need your help I don’t want
to spend the rest of my life trying
to figure out why this is happening

to me
WES
Okay okay Look you’re Christian
right
TYLER
Yeah
WES

Maybe it means supernatural as in
the Holy Ghost or God or someone

TYLER
Okay you’re getting a little too
into this

WES
No think about it Maybe God
thought it wasn’t your time to go
yet That he wanted you to have a
second chance at life So he gives
you a vision of the bridge you
happened to be going on collapsing
and minutes later it collapses
just like you saw it What if God
wanted you to cheat death so you
could have another chance at life

TYLER

Cheat death But wouldn’t that be
upsetting the motion of life or
whatever

(Beat)
Wait a minuteThe whole point of
me having the vision in the first
place was a warning right What if
we were meant to go on the bridge
as followed

WES
So you’re saying that by not
getting on the bridge in the first
place we could have changed
something

TYLER
Which is a big no-no

WES
I think you’re starting to get too
into this now

TYLER
I’m just trying to figure out what
the fuck is going on Tyler I’m
afraid I did someting I wasn’t
meant to do

Wes sets his books down on a nearby table and walks over to
Tyler

WES

Look go home It’s been a rough
two days you gotta get some sleep
Besides I need to work on my
history project and worrying about
this is making my day any better
Go talk to Daisy I’m pretty sure
she’s really concerned about you

TYLER
All right I’1l see you later
then I guess

WES
All right take care

Wes sits down at a table and begins opening a few books
Tyler walks through an aisle of books and out the door of the
library

EXT CITY - DAY

Tyler walks on the sidewalk passing by normal citizens He
bumps shoulders with a tall black MAN Tyler turns around

TYLER
Oh sorry about that

MAN
Don’t be sorry Tyler

Tyler is speechless The man smiles and turns around and
walks away Tyler backs away onto the street and over a
manhole with a little bit of steam coming out of it

The steam begins twirling around Tyler as if trying to
squeeze him Tyler hypnotized stares at the steam A horn
blares in his ears and the steam disperses into the air He
turns around and sees a driver in a car motioning him to get
out of the way

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tyler sits at his computer opening the Internet He goes to
a search engine and types in “Premonition” The page begins
to fill up with links to information about premonitions But
one catches his eye “Premonitions and Death” with a tiny
summary below it “How do they relate”

He clicks on the link and it takes him to a gothic looking
page with skulls and devils He clicks on the table of
contents to the left of the page to where it says
“Premonitions”

TYLER (VO)
Nobody knows how or when somebody
will have a premonition

(MORE)

TYLER (VO) (CONTD)
Usually certain people usually
those who are very religious have
a kind of dream or vision before a
large disaster or accident will
happen eventually turning out to
happen days even hours after they
had the premonition

He scrolls down the page

TYLER (VO)(CONT’D)
For example Abraham Lincoln had a
dream of his death and funeral
which he related to both his
bodyguard and his wife mere hours
before his assassination

He looks on the left side of the page at the table of
contents He clicks on a link titled “Death”

TYLER (VO) (CONTD)
Sometimes avoiding a disaster after
having a premonition can lead to
bizarre happenings A woman in
particular who had actually
boarded the Titanic knew as soon
as she had boarded what the outcome
of the voyage would be Her and her
daughter were able to get off
before the shipped departed A few
years later both the mother and
the daughter were killed in their
house after a fire had broken out

Tyler’s phone rings startling him He looks at the caller ID
and answers the phone

TYLER (CONTD)
Hey Cara

CARA (0S)
HeyHow’s it going

TYLER
You know me Staying up late doing
something

CARA (0S)
You’re hurting yourself Tyler You
need sleep

TYLER
How can any of us sleep after what
happened

CARA (0OS)
Look I don’t want you to become an
insomniac

TYLER
Don’t worry about me Cara I’m
going to be fine I’m slowly
getting over this I just have this
weird feeling

CARA (0S)
Like what

TYLER
I don’t know I’m trying to figure
it out I’11l talk to you later

CARA (0S)
Okay thenBye

Tyler hangs up and looks at his bed He sighs and lays down
closing his eyes
INT HOUSE - DAY

Daisy walks out of her room and into the kitchen where her
mom MRS WREN puts candle in a small chocolate cake

DAISY
The cake looks good Mom

MRS WREN
Anybody coming here to celebrate

DAISY
I know Leslie is Tyler might also

The doorbell rings

DAISY (CONTD)
That’s probably Leslie

Daisy quickly walks out of the room while Mrs Wren sets the
cake on the table She begins lighting the candles

Daisy opens the door and sees it’s Tyler She smiles and hugs
him They kiss and Daisy steps back

TYLER
Happy birthday
DAISY
I’m so glad you came Come in
We’re about to have cake

TYLER
Is Leslie here yet

DAISY
No not yet

TYLER
Is anybody else coming

DAISY
No I don’t really like having

parties Too much of a hassle and I

can’t really make things
interesting

They walk into the kitchen just as Mrs Wren finishes

lighting the candles

MRS WREN
Hey Tyler How are you

TYLER
I’m good thank you
(To Daisy)
Oh here I didn’t know what you
liked so

He hands her a bag with tissue paper stuffed
out a tiny bear holding a box of chocolates
Heart You”

DAISY
Aw Tyler I love it But this
looks like something they’d sell
for Valentine’s day

TYLER
You just have to search in the
right places I guess

The doorbell rings again

DAISY
Oh that’s Leslie

in it She pulls
The box says “I

Daisy leaves and Mrs Wren goes upstairs Tyler walks over to
the cake and sees seventeen candles arranged in a smiley
face In the middle “Happy Birthday Daisy” is written In
the background he can hear Daisy and Leslie talking

A breeze comes through the kitchen and the candle flames
begin to flicker He looks around the room and up at the
ceiling where an air conditioning duct is There are strings
hanging from the duct but they aren’t moving indicating
there’s no air coming from it

He looks back down and the candles begin to go out one by
one The smoke rises around Tyler just like the steam from
the manhole He looks at it move as if it has a mind of its
own

DAISY (0S) (CONT’D)
Yeah Tyler’s here too

Tyler turns around and sees Leslie standing next to Daisy
Leslie looks at Tyler uncomfortably

LESLIE
Hi Tyler

There’s a moment of silence until Daisy realizes the candles
have been blown out

DAISY
Damn it Mom I thought you lit
these

MRS WREN

I did light them The air
conditioning must have blown them
out

Tyler looks up at the air conditioning duct and sees the
strings still aren’t moving Daisy begins relighting the
candles

TYLER
Well I better get going I have
to—

DAISY

Already No please don’t I like
having you hear Besides Leslie
and I were going to the arcade
after this

Daisy looks at Tyler with the saddest look on her face Tyler
gives in

TYLER
You know I hate it when you do
that Okay I’1ll come but only for
a little bit

Daisy smiles and hugs Tyler

DAISY
Here let’s have some cake and
then we can leave

INT ARCADE - DAY

Lights flash like strobe lights and kids dash back and forth
going from game to game earning tickets and laughing

Daisy Leslie and Tyler walk in sitting down at a nearby
table Leslie pulls out a box wrapped in wrapping paper and
hands it to Daisy

Daisy unwraps it and her eyes grow wide and her mouth drops
It’s an iHome

DAISY
How did youThis is incredible
How were you able to afford it

LESLIE
I had my parents help me pay for
it plus using pretty much all the
paychecks I got from my job

DAISY
Thank you so much

She gets up and hugs Leslie

LESLIE
Go ahead try it out The batteries
are already in it

Daisy pulls out her iPod and sticks it in the slot She turns
on her iPod and switches to any song and it begins playing
It works perfectly

DAISY
This is awesome Thanks Leslie

LESLIE
No problem You were always talking
about it so I decided to finally
get you one

DAISY
Yeah but you didn’t have to
LESLIE
Hey it’s your birthday You
deserve it

The three of them become quiet and the song continues
play

DAISY
Come on let’s go play some games

TYLER
I will in a few minutes I’m going
to sit here for a few minutes I’m
kind of tired

DAISY
Leslie

LESLIE
I’1l join you in a while too I’m
probably going to get something to
drink or something

DAISY
Oh okay Promise Both of you

TYLER
Yeah

Daisy smiles and walks off Leslie turns to Tyler
LESLIE
You two are perfect for each other
you know
TYLER
Yeah she’s great I wouldn’t know
what I’d do without
Tyler looks down at his feet

LESLIE
You okay

TYLER
No Leslie no I’m not okay

LESLIE
What’s wrong

TYLER
Everything First the vision of the
bridge collapsing and I’ve been
getting these strange feeling
everywhere I go Like someone—or
something—is watching me I have
this feeling that something bad is
going to happen Like I did before
I had the premonition of the
bridge

LESLIE
What was that feeling like

TYLER
Like I knew something bad was
going to happen before it did I
was overcome by fear and I couldn’t
make it go away It stuck to me
since the night before it happened

LESLIE
I can see why you would be afraid
after this ‘premonition’ of your
happened but why do you think
something bad is going to happen
later on

Tyler rubs his eyes and runs his fingers through his hair

TYLER
I did some research last night
about premonitions like where they
come from or how someone has them

LESLIE
What did you find out

TYLER
People usually have dreams of an
accident before it happens to warn
them possibly from a supernatural
feat that is if you’re a
religious person

LESLIE
And your Christian right

TYLER
Yes but I don’t know if this
premonition was sent by God or the
Holy Ghost or whatever The feeling
I had when I first got it was dark
(MORE)

TYLER (CONTD)
I felt nothing but fear as if
something evil had given me the
vision

LESLIE
Look I think youre overreacting—

TYLER

No I’m not overreacting Leslie
Listen to this Four people who
didn’t even know each other had a
dream of a plane crash they were
supposed to be on the night before
The next day the plane had crash
landed killing everyone on board
A few weeks later those four
people who happened to be in the
same building at the same time were
killed when the building collapsed

LESLIE
It’s just a coincidence

TYLER
That’s what it seems like These
people were meant to die but
avoided the accident By doing so
they died later on in these freak
accidents

LESLIE
Are there any cases of this
happening

Tyler pulls out a few papers printed from the website he was
at the night before

TYLER
A woman and her child boarded the
Titanic Just as the woman stepped
onto the boat she had a
premonition of the Titanic sinking
Her and her daughter got off before
the ship sailed off A few years
after the Titanic sank their house
caught on fire killing both of
them

Leslie reads over the papers and looks up at Tyler
LESLIE

I don’t see how you believe this
Tyler This is a load of bullshit

TYLER
Leslie You didn’t see what I saw
in the premonition If you had it
youd probably be doing what I’d be
doing thinking what I’d be
thinking and feeling what I am
feeling right this second

LESLIE
Really And what’s that feeling

TYLER
(Eyes watery)
Fear

Daisy sits at a racing game really into the game She steps
further down on the pedal and passes the car in front of her
getting her in first place

Two delivery workers come through the entrance of the arcade
pushing a large game on a cart They walk up to a desk where
an arcade employee sits He points to the back of the arcade

The delivery people push the car towards the back As they
push the cart one of the screws from the back right wheel
begins to push out It falls out unnoticable to anybody

Daisy quits playing the racing game and walks over to the
back where the delivery people are She sees the new game
called “Head Trauma” and walks over to it The delivery
people park the cart next to a box arcade game where you sit
down and pull the curtains to make it dark usually a
shooting game

She looks at the new arcade game the delivery people have
brought and stares at it

DELIVERY MAN
Come on let’s get these papers
signed so we can get out of here

The delivery men walk over to the employee at the desk and
Daisy gets in the box arcade game shutting the curtains and
putting in her coins She pulls out one of the guns and gets
ready to play setting her phone on the seat

The cart shifts over a little by itself another bolt popping
out of the back right tire Then another one the wheel
starts to wiggle A bolt comes out of the front right wheel
and falls onto the ground rolling underneath the cart

Back at the table the song “Daisy” by Switchfoot comes on
grabbing Tyler’s attention

LESLIE
Don’t begin getting paranoid about
this kind of stuff There’s no
reason to be afraid anymore

TYLER
I can’t help but be afraid The bad
feeling I have is always with me
never going away

LESLIE
Maybe you need to get checked up or
something

The continues to play getting louder by itself Tyler looks
at the iPod closely The title of the song “Daisy” begins to
flicker and fade out He stares at it

SWITCHFOOT
‘Let it go Daisy let it go Open
up your fist this fallen world
Doesnt hold your interest doesnt
hold your soul Daisy let it go’

LESLIE
Tyler You okay

TYLER
What

LESLIE

I said are you okay You look sick

Tyler looks back at the iPod The name “Daisy” disappears
from the screen

SWITCHFOOT
‘Giving isnt easy Neither is the
rain when she gives herself away
Daisy—Daisy—Daisy—

The song gets stuck at the word “Daisy” playing it over
again Leslie looks at the iHome and slaps it trying to make
it continue with the song Tyler stares at his his breathing
getting harder

LESLIE
What the hell I just got this and
it’s already screwing up

Tyler stands up knocking his chair over

LESLIE (CONT’D)
God damn it
(To Tyler)
What’s wrong

TYLER
I’m having another one of those bad
feelings What game did Daisy say
she was going to play

LESLIE
I don’t know Try calling her

Tyler pulls out his phone and speed dials Daisy’s number

Leslie continues to try and get the song to continue playing
but it’s still stuck on “Daisy”

INT BOX ARCADE GAME

Daisy’s phone is on silent but it’s vibrating It begins to
slide towards the edge of the seat The sound of the game is
too loud for Daisy to hear the phone vibrating as she shoots
at mutant creatures trying to attack her

Another bolt from the front right wheel falls off and the
cart begins to wiggle with the wheels

INT ARCADE

Tyler does a full 360 degree turn

TYLER
Come on Daisy pick up the phone

LESLIE
Why don’t we try and find her

TYLER
Ill go do that You stay here

Tyler begins walking off and Leslie stands up about to
follow Tyler but he turns aruond

TYLER (CONTD)
No Leslie stay here okay

LESLIE
I was just going to help you find—

TYLER
Just stay here damn it
(More calmly)
I just need to be alone with Daisy
right now

LESLIE
(Sitting back down)
Oh I understand Sorry

Tyler runs off and Leslie looks back at the iHome The song
gets unstuck and continues to play normally

INT BOX ARCADE GAME

Daisy continues to shoot at her enemies as her phone still
vibrates It stops at the very edge

INT ARCADE

Tyler stops and hears Daisy’s answering machine He hangs up
and flips his phone back open calling her number again
INT BOX ARCADE GAME

Her phone vibrates again moving over the edge It falls onto
the floor making a sound loud enough for Daisy to hear

DAISY
Shit

She looks back at the screen which says “GAME OVER” on it
in bloody letters She sets the gun back in the slot and
opens the curtain bending down to get her phone She answers
it still squatting

DAISY (CONTD)

Hello
TYLER (0S)
Daisy
INT ARCADE
TYLER

Daisy where are you

EXT BOX ARCADE GAME

DAISY
I’m at the back of the arcade Why

TYLER (0OS)
Just stay where you are

He hangs up and she stares at her phone She grabs the box
arcade game and pulls herself up but her hand slips and she
falls on her back

INT ARCADE

Tyler runs through the arcade zig-zagging through games and
people He runs towards the back

EXT BOX ARCADE GAME

The wheels on the cart give in and they break off the Head
Trauma game tipping over onto the box arcade game Daisy
gasps and covers her face but slowly pulls her hands away as
Head Trauma had been stopped by the box arcade game

Tyler runs around the corner and sees Daisy under Head
Trauma

TYLER
Daisy

Daisy begins to sit up when Head Trauma slips off the box
arcade game

TYLER (CONTD)
Daisy

Daisy looks up but it’s too late Head Trauma comes down on
her head and shoulders creating a sickening crunch Blood
sprays on the box arcade game and on the words “Head Trauma”
Her body jolts as her head is crushed

Tyler covers his mouth his eyes wide He opens his mouth
but nothing comes out People in the back look at what
happened gasping Tyler falls to his knees staring at
Daisy’s twitching body He holds his hand out to her but
quickly snatches it back

TYLER (CONTD)
NO

EXT ARCADE

An ambulance sits in front of the entrance with bystanders
watching the paramedics pull Daisy’s body to the vehicle on
the stretcher Tyler watches them put her body in the back
and turns away sitting down on the curb

His eyes are red and puffy and he holds the bear that he gave
Daisy for her birthday He looks back at the ambulance
Standing in front of it is Leslie Tears streaming down her
face she looks at Tyler shakes her head and looks away

Tyler looks at the parking lot Standing between two cars is
the man he saw in the city He watches the man as the man
stares back A news van drives by

CARA (0S)
Hey Tyler

Tyler looks over and sees Cara and Tucker riding their bikes
to him He stands up

TUCKER
What happened here

Cara sees Tyler’s red eyes and a tear cascades down his
cheek

CARA
Oh my God Tyler are you okay

He squeezes the bear and looks back up at Cara

TYLER
Daisy’s dead

Cara opens her mouth to say something but she can’t make
anything come out She grabs Tyler and holds him tightly He
looks up at Tucker who lowers his bike to the ground and
collapses resting his head on his hand

Cara lets go and Tyler looks back out into the parking lot
where he saw the man but he isn’t there anymore

INT SCHOOL - DAY

Mason Bridge Tuesday morning at
815 AM after the supports

REPORTER (0S) (CONT’D)
Seven people avoided the disaster
when one of the drivers got out of
his vehicle and stopped the
traffic Officers nearby said the
driver had seen the bridge collapse
before it actually happened

Tyler walks up to Wes He pats Tyler on the back

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Tyler sits on a couch watching the news with the REPORTER

television

REPORTER
Police officials are still
searching through the debris still
left in the river while most had
been carried down stream There
were no survivors whatsoever and

notice

Tyler switches the channels to another news station A woman
reports outside of the arcade from earlier that day

REPORTER 2

age of 17 when an arcade game had
tipped over crushing her We’1l

Tyler looks over at the kitchen table The bear he got for
her sits on top of it staring at him Tyler grabs the remote
and turns of the TV throwing the remote at the wall

EXT SCHOOL - DAY

Tyler Tucker and Cara sit outside of the school at a table
Cara and Tucker have lunch but Tyler has nothing

TUCKER
It’s so weird man Why did it
happen

CARA

Tucker please don’t start I don’t
want to talk about it I don’t
think any of us do

TUCKER
I just think it’s weird you know
I mean she was one of the people
who didn’t go on the bridge and
after a few days she’s dead

Tyler lifts his head up Leslie walks around the corner and
sees Tyler She stops and stares at him

CARA
Tucker please just drop it It
happened three days ago That’s a
little too early to be talking
about it

Leslie begins walking towards the group of three Tyler
slowly stands up

TYLER
Leslie

Leslie continues to walk not saying anything

TYLER (CONTD)
Leslie please

Leslie stops but doesn’t turn around

LESLIE
I don’t care what you have to say
Tyler because whatever it is it’s
not going to bring Daisy back

Leslie turns around

TYLER
Look I loved her as much as you
did

(MORE )

TYLER (CONTD)
I couldn’t have stopped what was
going to happen I got there too
late to pull her out of the way I
don’t want you to blame this on me
(To everyone)

I don’t want all of you to think
that I’m causing this because I’m
some sort of freak or something

Tyler pulls out the bear from his backpack He hands it to
Leslie

TYLER (CONTD)
I don’t want anything that reminds
me of the past few days right now
I just don’t want any of you
starting to avoid me because of
what’s happening

Leslie looks down at the bear She gently pulls it from
Tyler’s hands and looks at it in the eyes She is close to
crying

LESLIE
Thanks Tyler

Tyler smiles a little but it quickly fades away He turns
away and walks back to Tucker and Cara but is stopped by
Leslie

LESLIE (CONTD)
Tyler I want to talk to you

INT SCHOOL
Tyler and Leslie walk side by side together down a sidewalk

LESLIE
On Friday before Daisywas
killed you said you were having
another one of those bad feelings

TYLER
Yeah

LESLIE
Do you think you can tell me what
that felt like Or how you knew
something bad was going to happen

Tyler stops walking Leslie stops and turns to Tyler
TYLER
I had the same feeling I did before
the bridge collapse It was like
there was something that shouldn’t
have been there like a presence or
something

They walk outside

EXT SCHOOL
They sit down at a bench just as it starts to rain

TYLER
When I heard Daisy’s name in that
song I suddenly got that feeling
that we shouldn’t have been there

LESLIE
So what You thought the song was
giving you a sign that Daisy was
going to die

TYLER
I don’t think it was the song Some
freak accident like that doesn’t
normally happen every day you know
and it’s a one out of a million
chance to know that something like
that was going to happen

LESLIE
Then how did you know Daisy was in
trouble

TYLER

Something in me told me that I
should check on her just in case I
didn’t know she was going to die

LESLIE
None of us did

Tyler gets up and begins to walk away
TYLER
I just don’t want to deal with this

right now

LESLIE
Tyler

He stops and turns around

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Don’t ignore those feelings
They’re probably trying to tell you
something

Tyler takes this into consideration He slowly turns around
and walks away He walks around the corner of the school when
his cell phone begins beeping He pulls it out of his pocket
and opens it up

Wes has sent him a text message saying “Meet me where I
work” He closes his phone and walks into the school

EXT GARDEN NURSERY - DAY

Wes dressed in a blue apron with the name of the store
printed in bold yellow letters sets pots on a shelf pushing
a cart full of plants and tools Tucker and Tyler follow
behind him

WES
Yeah the job sucks but I’m trying
to get a spot as a waiter ata
restaurant

TUCKER
It’s not as great as you think but
the place I worked at for a while I
earned ten dollars an hour

WES
Shit Where did you work

TUCKER
At the Chili’s down on 360

WES
I gotta check it out sometime
Where’s Cara by the way You two
literally never leave each other’s

side

TUCKER
She had to babysit her little
brother

TYLER

Look can you just tell us why you
brought us here
Wes pushes the basket further down the aisle

WES
Ah two things First what
happened to you Tyler has
happened before

TYLER
What The premonition thing That’s
happened for hundreds of years
maybe even thousands

WES
Yeah but this is different Two
years ago there was this major
pile up on Route 23 about two hours
away from here Man it was hellish
Though what’s weird is that this
girl has a vision of it before it
happens and she and a few other
people are prevented from going
onto the road

He sets a few plants on a table

TYLER
Like us

WES
Yeah but things get weirder After
a day or so one of the people who
was stopped from going onto Route
23 was killed outside of his
apartment

TUCKER
Just like Daisy

Tyler looks at Tucker angrily and then back at Wes

TYLER
Where are you going with this

WES
Look the main point of this story
is that the people who were stopped
from going onto Route 23 were
killed in these accidents that
usually don’t happen every day And
sorry to bring this up but what
happened to Daisy surely was no
fucking every day accident

TYLER
Well do you know why they started
dying like that

WES
Something about cheating death or
some weird shit

TUCKER
That’s bullshit Wes

TYLER
No noI believe him A few days
ago I researched a few things Some
of these people had visions of
something happen before it actually
happened and after a while they
died

TUCKER
Why though

WES
Maybe because those who avoided the
disaster were never meant to avoid
it at all as if the whole thing
was planned

TYLER
So what are you trying to say That
since we didn’t get on the bridge
when we were meant to we’re going
to die

WES
I don’t know Tyler I can’t
predict the futureLike some
people

They walk to another part of the nursery where there are
tables with plants sitting on them There is a large tool
shelf with blue tarp hanging behind it Various tools lie on
the shelf such as garden shears Cape Cod weeders and
sickles

TYLER
WaitIn my premonition Daisy was
killed first And out of all of us
she’s the only one who’s died so
far

TUCKER
Call it a coincidence

TYLER
I don’t know But what’s the other
thing you wanted to tell us

WES
Right I found out who the other
guy was the one who almost hit the
back of your truck

TYLER
Who

WES
Derek Ross 12th grade held back
two years I figured we’d get his
name just in case any more weird
stuff happens to us we could meet
together

Near them another employee sets a pot down full of dirt with
a large plant in it He grabs the water hose and sticks it in
the pot and turns it on Water begins to flow slowly out of
it

TUCKER
What are you trying to say that
what happened to Daisy is going to
start happening to us

WES
No I’m not saying anything What
I’m trying to tell you is that if
whatever the fuck happened on Route
23 might be happening to us and we
need to know what to do if it is

The water hose falls out of the pot and onto the ground
making a puddle of water The water begins to creep towards
the group of three as if it had a mind of its own

Behind the tarp another employee pushes a car with water
hoses and more pots The water hose catches onto a nail
sticking out of a leg of a wooden table The hose begins to
stretch out the employee oblivious to what’s happening The
employee leaves the cart by another table walking away

Wes begins putting the garden tools on the shelf one by one
Tyler and Tucker stand back watching him unaware of the
water passing by their feet Wes accidentally drops a tool
and Tucker steps forward to pick it up

As he does so he steps in the path of the water But the
water takes a sudden left turn avoiding Tucker’s step

Tyler walks past Wes and towards another tool shelf with more
gardening tools on it He grabs a round metallic thermometer
with pictures of birds and flowers painted on it Everything
is reflected off of it

Tyler stares at himself in the mirror-like object looking at
the bags under his eyes He sighs and is about to put the
thermometer up when he sees behind him the tool shelf
falling towards him the tools flying off the shelf

Tyler spins around and steps back tripping over himself and
falling on the ground dropping the thermometer He looks up
and sees the tool shelf hasn’t even budged Tucker and Wes
stare at him

WES (CONT’D)
You okay

TYLER
YeahSomething startled me
That’s all

TUCKER
Look are we finished I need to get
home

Tyler stands up and puts the thermometer back where he found
it He walks back to Tucker and Wes Wes finishes putting the
tools on the shelf and steps back

On the other side of the blue tarp an employee struggling
with a large pot walks towards the hose caught on the nail
sticking out of the table leg

Wes steps on the water and on the tile floor it makes it
slippery Wes slips back landing on the floor Before Tucker
or Tyler can react and help him up the struggling employee
trips over the hose falling forward

The employee flies into the blue tarp falling on the shelf
The shelf falls forward sharp gardening tools fly off
towards Wes

But Tucker comes in and pulls Wes out of the way The tool
shelf lands on the table that was behind Wes when he fell
the tools shooting out like arrows and landing on the floor
making a loud clatter

Tyler runs over and helps Wes and Tucker up

WES
Holy shit

TUCKER
You okay

WES
Yeah I’m fine Shit that was close

The employee who tripped pokes his head around the blue tarp
with an alert look on his face

EMPLOYEE
Sorry about that Are you all okay

WES

Yeah we’re fine Maybe you should
uh be more careful next time

EXT GARDEN NURSERY

Tyler walks out into the rain looking down at the ground He
bumps into the same man he had bumped into before

TYLER
Sorry

He turns around and sees the man

TYLER (CONTD)
Hey

The man turns around

MAN
Yes

TYLER
What’s your name

MR BLUDWORTH
William Bludworth

MR BLUDWORTH begins to walk away but Tyler stops him

TYLER
How did you know my name

MR BLUDWORTH
You’1l know when you need my help
as time goes by

Mr Bludworth walks away leaving Tyler standing in the rain
getting soaked

INT ROOM - NIGHT

Tyler looks through online newspaper articles He comes to a
page with a picture of Kimberly Corman and Officer Burke In
bold letters the headlines are “Survivors of a deadly crash
die in bizarre accident Faulty woodchipper to blame”

He reads the article and clicks on a related link leading
him to a page with a picture of a skeleton with burnt
surroundings The headline “Flight 180 survivor dies in
explosion” Tyler looks next to his computer It’s the same
picture of him and his older brother He sighs

Tyler flips out his cell phone and dials Wes’ phone number
It rings a few times and Wes finally picks up

WES (0S)
(Groggy)
Hello

WES (0S)
(Still groggy)
YeahYeah I’m awake

me that the people who didn’t get
on Route 23 began to die in bizarre
accidents

Before Tyler can speak Wes hangs up He turns off his
computer and gets into bed turning off the lamp

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Tyler walks into the school less people staring at him but
still some gossiping to each other He walks over to his
locker and opens it He puts in a few books and takes out a
binder

He shuts the locker and sees Derek standing next to him He
gets startled by him

DEREK
Alright Daily what’s going on

TYLER
Okay I’m guess Wes told you who I
was but this is urgent so I don’t
want any fucking around

DEREK
Just tell me what the hell is going
on

TYLER

Walk with me Okay you saw what
happened when I began freaking out
before the bridge collapsed right

DEREK
Yeah I never seen anyone so scared
You were one scared son of a bitch

TYLER
Look a few days later my
girlfriend had died in this
accident at the arcade

DEREK
Oh well I’m sorry man but what
does that have to do with us

Cara Leslie and Tucker walk up to Tyler and Derek quickly

TUCKER
Okay we’re here What is it

TYLER
Look I think we’re all in danger
right now

LESLIE
What do you mean

TYLER
Okay look everyone needs to know
In my premonition Daisy was the
first one to die A few days later
Daisy was killed in the arcade
Then yesterday Wes was almost
killed at the garden nursery but
Tucker pulled him out of the way

LESLIE
So

TYLER
In my premonition Wes was the
second person to die

DEREK
So was everyone here in the
premonition
TYLER
YeahExcept for Cara She wasn’t
on the bridge when it collapsed

CARA
So that means I’m safe right

TYLER
You should beBut that’s not the
point Look if this kind of patter
continues to follow we’re going to
have start watching over each
other because if this keeps
happening we’re all going to die

LESLIE
Oh my God

Tucker steps up to Tyler
TUCKER
Are you sure it was only Cara who

wasn’t on the bridge Nobody else

TYLER
Yeah

CARA
Oh my God Tucker

Cara and Tucker embrace tightly

DEREK
How do we know who’s next to die
though

TYLER

I’m not sureWhen Daisy died
that’s when I had that bad feeling
I told Leslie about and—wait the
song on the radio It got stuck on
the word Daisy and a few minutes
after she was killed

LESLIE
So it was like a sign telling you
she was going to die

TYLER
I think so And in my reflection
when I was looking at that
thermometer in the garden nursery
I saw the shelf behind me about to
fall on top of me and later the
shelf behind Wes fell down and the
tools on it almost killed him

LESLIE
Are you the only one who can see
these signs

TYLER
I don’t know

LESLIE
Well then who’s next

Tyler closes his eyes and tries to think but he shakes his
head

TYLER
I don’t know I can’t remember I’m
too tired to remember

The bell rings and everyone goes to their classes Cara urges
Tucker to walk with her to their class

DEREK
Well if you see another sign call
whoever is next okay I don’t want
to die in front of my class okay

LESLIE
There are other people who have
died before you and all you’re
thinking about is yourself

DEREK
Hey look missy I’m 19 I still
have a full life ahead of me I
don’t want to die yet and I’m sure
you don’t want to either

TYLER

She walks in the direction she was headed Tyler watches her
turn the corner and walks into his classroom

INT MATH CLASROOM

Tyler walks in and everyone watches him He sits down in his
seat

TEACHER
All right everyone now since Mr
Daily has decided to join us you
need nothing on your desk except
for a pencil and a calculator

Everyone does what their told Tyler pulls out a normal
calculator and sets it on his desk with his pencil The
teacher begins handing out the tests

INT CHEMISTRY CLASROOM
Leslie walks to her classroom doors and tries opening the

door but it’s locked The teacher gets up from his desk and
opens the door for her apologizing quietly

Leslie walks in as the class has already begun the test She
gives the teacher a slight grin and quickly finds her seat

There is a table at the front of the room with a TV hanging
over it There is also a white board with magnets on it One
of the magnets has keys hanging from it

The door slams shut startling everyone The vibrations are
sent through the walls and the TV begins to bounce slightly
one of the bolts loosening from the TV rack The teacher
grabs a test and hands it to her

INT MATH CLASSROOM

Tyler continues with his test Near the teacher a fan blows
side to side blowing air on her and the students whenever it
passes them Tyler’s paper flutters every time the air hits
him He stares at the fan unable to concentrate on anything
else

INT CHEMISTRY CLASROOM

Leslie works on her test She stops and looks around setting
her pencil down She looks down at her binder seeing
pictures of her and Daisy as her binder cover

They’re pictures of them with other friends of them when
they were younger others are the two at a camp and one
special one with Leslie Daisy Tyler and Wes

Her eyes become watery but she quickly stops herself from
crying turning her binder over so she doesn’t see the
pictures Leslie goes back to working on her test trying
hard to keep the tears away

INT MATH CLASSROOM

The teacher turns off the fan and continues typing away at
her computer Tyler looks at the fan It’s facing him A
breeze that only he can feel blows across his face and he
looks at the fan but it doesn’t move

Tyler tries hard to finish his test punching in numbers on
his calculator He looks up on the board and sees a formula
for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon (n-2) 180°
but the number 180 catches his attention

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

Derek whistles as he walks down the hallway with a hall pass
in his hand He stops when he looks into a classroom and sees
Leslie working on her test He stares at her

CRAIG JOHNSON walks up to Derek

CRAIG
Hey man What’s up

DEREK
Huh Oh just walking through the
hallways

CRAIG

What are you looking at

DEREK
Her

Craig looks at Leslie

CRAIG
She’s cute

DEREK
She’s a junior

CRAIG
Do you even know who she is

They begin walking down the hallway

DEREK
She’s one of the people who avoided
the Mason Bridge disaster

CRAIG
Shit man she’s pretty damn lucky

DEREK
Yeah but for how long

CRAIG
What do you mean

DEREK
(Snapping out of it)
Nothing It’s hard to explain and
you wouldn’t believe me

CRAIG
Whatever man Hey look I gotta go
back to class so I’ll see you after
school

DEREK
Sure Craig

Craig walks off and Derek slowly walks down the hallway

INT MATH CLASSROOM

Tyler turns his test in to the teacher He slowly walks back
to his desk and sits down fumbling with his calculator He
begins punching in random numbers and erasing them

He punches in 07734 and turns it upside down making it say
“hello”

INT CHEMISTRY CLASROOM

Leslie looks up at the girl in front of her who puts on
makeup using a compact mirror Leslie looks in the mirror and
a large black shadow engulfs the mirror The girl using it
doesn’t notice it but Leslie does and she looks behind her
and sees nothing

She looks back at the compact mirror and the black shadow is
gone Leslie looks behind her one more time just to check

INT MATH CLASSROOM

Tyler continues to mess with his calculator typing in
5318008 turning it upside down making it say “boobies”
That brings a slight smile to his face but it quickly fades
away

He sets the calculator down on his desk and reaches into his
backpack pulling out one of his books He slides it on his
desk accidentally pushing the calculator off the desk and
onto the floor

One of the students sitting next to Tyler picks it up for
him He thanks them quietly and looks at the calculator Just
as he is about to erase it he notices something

On the calculator right side up it reads as 317537 He
looks at it closer slowly turning it upside down As he gets
it fully upside down those numbers morph into the name
“Leslie”

Tyler drops the calculator on his desk and stands up slowly
Most of the students look up at him and the teacher looks at
him too

TEACHER
Tyler is something wrong

Tyler looks back down at his desk at the upside down
calculator It still says “Leslie” on it Tyler darts out of
the room the teacher standing up but isn’t able to do
anything

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

Tyler runs out of the classroom and down the hallway The
lights above him begin to flicker as he runs under them He
passes Derek

DEREK
Yo dude where are you going

Tyler doesn’t answer Derek quickly walks in the direction
Tyler’s going

INT CHEMISTRY CLASROOM

Leslie finishes her test and gets up out of her seat walking
up to the front of the classroom As she hands her test to
the teacher another student walks out of the classroom with
a hall pass the door shutting quickly

It slams shut the vibrations causing the most loose bolt to
fall out landing on a pile of papers quietly The vibrations
also cause the keys to fall off one of the magnets and onto
the hook of a lower magnet causing it to slide down the
white board

The magnet falls into a cup of white board markers on the
chalk tray falling to the ground and markers spilling
everywhere on the floor Leslie stops and begins picking the
markers up and putting them back in the cup

She steps back to pick up more markers when she slips on a
few causing her to lose her balance She falls backwards and
lands on the floor sliding back a little

Her shoulder hits the legs of a table A plastic cup of water
falls on her splashing on her and getting her wet A plastic
container with a few scissors fall over on top of her Leslie
shields her eyes but is unscathed by the scissors

The students giggle due to her clumsiness while the teacher
stand up as Leslie picks the scissors off of her She holds
two in her hands above her face as the teacher says

TEACHER
Leslie are you okay

LESLIE
Yeah I think so

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

Tyler runs up to Leslie’s classroom door and tries opening it
but it’s locked He looks through the window

TYLER
Leslie

INT CHEMISTRY CLASROOM

Leslie looks at Tyler but it’s too late The TV comes loose
from its rack and falls off landing face down on Leslie’s
head and chest the glass screen shattering and sparks flying
everywhere

Everyone in the classroom backs away to the back of the room
as Leslie’s body is crushed and electrocuted at the same
time Her body convulses as sparks fly in every direction

TYLER
No

Leslie continues to be electrocuted her skin turning dark
charred and bloody blood squirting on the walls and on the
floor The sparks stop and Leslie’s body is still Smoke
fills the classroom and the students scream The teacher
pulls the fire alarm

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

The fire alarm startles Derek as he walks over to Tyler
still looking through the window but he is in total shock
He turns around and leans against the window as Derek comes
up to him

DEREK
(Trying to look through
window)
What’s going on

TYLER
Don’tlook

Students begin to walk out of their classrooms confused by
what’s going Tyler slides to the floor breaking down and
Derek looks through the window and sees Leslie’s charred
body He gasps and looks away

INT CHEMISTRY CLASROOM - LATER

Paramedics are in the room with a stretcher along with
firemen checking the place out Tyler waits outside the
door

The paramedics slowly lift the TV off of Leslie glass
breaking and blood dripping off the TV The paramedics get
the TV off revealing a horrific sight One pair of scissors
is stuck in her right eye while the other pair in her other
hand are stuck in her throat

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

The paramedics pull Leslie’s dead body on the stretcher out
of the classroom and down the hallway Derek stands next to
Tyler

TYLER
I was too lateI couldn’t have
saved her even if the door wasn’t
locked I couldn’t have saved her

DEREK
It wasn’t your fault okay

TYLER
No it was If I didn’t have that
fucking premonition of the bridge
collapse

DEREK
Don’t say that You saved seven
people including yourself You gave
us a second chance

Tyler looks back at the blood-stained area
DEREK (CONTD)
But why are these things happening
Why are we all of a sudden dying

Tyler looks up at Derek

TYLER
I know who we can go to

EXT TRUCK

Tyler pulls out a phonebook and flips through the pages while
Cara Tucker Derek and Wes stand outside of the truck He
gets to the Bs section and looks through the “Blo’s” but
doesn’t see “Bloodworth” anywhere

TYLER
Damn it’s not in here

WES
What are you looking for

TYLER
Hold on

He continues to finger through the pages until he finds
William Bludworth’s name He flips out his phone and dials
the number

CARA
Tyler what are you doing

TYLER
Just hold on for a second

The other line rings a few times and finally a dark
sinister voice comes on

MR BLUDWORTH (0S)
Hello Tyler

TYLER
You told me I’d need your help as
time came by

MR BLUDWORTH (0S)
Ah yes

TYLER
What do you know that I don’t

MR BLUDWORTH
1423 Harper Street

TYLER
What

MR BLUDWORTH
Go there and I’1ll tell you

Mr Bludworth hangs up and Tyler looks at the rest of the
group

TYLER
Anybody know where 1423 Harper
Street is

INT TRUCK

Tyler drives with Wes in the passenger seat and the other
three in the back

DEREK
Who are we going to see anyways

TYLER
I don’t know but he seems to know
a hell of a lot more than we do
about what is happening here

Tyler drives fast down the highway towards the country

EXT MORGUE

They arrive at a gloomy location the trees bare and fog
everywhere Everyone gets out of the truck and looks at the
large building that stands before them built out of stone
almost medieval looking

They walk over to a large wooden door and knock on it They
wait for an answer but the door doesn’t open Tyler bangs
the knocker on the door again Coming from a speaker Mr
Bludworth’s voice is heard

MR BLUDWORTH
Go around back

The five look at each other and begin their way around the
building They get to the back and find another wooden door
smaller though Tyler pushes it open and it leads into a
dark unknown abyss

INT MORGUE

They walk down a long corridor before arriving into a large
white room with two metallic tables cabinets and operation
tools There are white sheets on the tables except something
lies on the tables in a shape of a human form

The place is eerily quiet until everyone jumps at the sound
of a door slamming shut the sound echoing through the
building

They look at where the sound was coming from and coming down
a flight of stone stairs is Mr Bludworth smiling at the
five

MR BLUDWORTH
Ah nice to see you again Tyler
And it looks as if you brought some
friends along too

TYLER
They were the ones who avoided—

MR BLUDWORTH
The bridge collapse I know

TYLER
Who the hell are you and how do you
know what’s going on

Mr Bludworth walks over to the body under the sheets
rolling the sheet off the body’s face It’s man bloody and
bruised and his arm is partly stitched to the rest of his
body

CARA
Oh my God

Mr Bludworth begins stitching up the rest of the man’s arm
laughing

MR BLUDWORTH
Tyler are you familiar with the
name Alex Browning

TYLER
No no not really

Mr Bludworth sighs

MR BLUDWORTH
What about Kimberly Corman

TYLER
Yeah she’s the one who had the
premonition of that pile up

MR BLUDWORTH
You Alex Browning and Kimberly
Corman all have something in
common

TYLER
What’s that

MR BLUDWORTH
You three all got a second chance
by cheating death

TUCKER
Cheating death

Mr Bludworth continues to stitch Tyler walks over to Mr
Bludworth

TYLER
What’s going on

MR BLUDWORTH
Tyler when you had that
premonition you were able to stop
only a few people from going on By
doing so you have screwed up a
plan that Death had designed for
you and your friends And by
screwing up Death’s plan you
really have pissed him off

TYLER
Why are people beginning to die
though

MR BLUDWORTH
Just because you cheated death
once doesn’t mean it’s over
already You cheated death by not
going on the bridge Now death
must come back to finish the
business

Mr Bludworth smiles and covers up the man with the sheet
DEREK

So you’re saying Death is pretty
much stalking us
MR BLUDWORTH
Tyler let me tell you something
Think of all of this as a game that
Death has set up picking seven
people off a list and putting them
on a new one Since Death has
invented the games he has invented
the rules The first rule Death
must give a sign in order to do
what he has to do

TYLER
A signThe song on the radio The
calculator

MR BLUDWORTH
Don’t ignore those signs Tyler
They’re the things that might save
your friendsfor a while

Tyler shifts uncomfortably

MR BLUDWORTH (CONT’D)
Now as the victims Death has
chosen you want to live right In
order to do so you must cheat in
order to survive

TYLER
And we did by avoiding the bridge
disaster

MR BLUDWORTH
And once you did that Death has
come back for you and your little
friends killing them off in the
order he chose for them to die in

TYLER
The orderHold on a second
though Daisy died first in my
premonition then Wes and then
Leslie But I pulled Wes away
before he was killedWhy did
Leslie die the next day

MR BLUDWORTH
You intervened Tyler You were
able to help Wes cheat death once
again

Wes steps forward
Mr

WES
So that means I’m safe now right

Bludworth chuckles

MR BLUDWORTH
Once you’re on the list you can’t
get off of it By pulling Wes away
from whatever was going to kill
him that only moved him to the
bottom of the listright after
you Tyler

WES
Ah fuck man

TYLER
How do we stop it

MR BLUDWORTH
Tyler one cannot stop Death from
doing what he has to do but one
can overcome him for a certain
amount of time And that is by
intervening

TUCKER
Are you sure we were all meant to
die on the bridge

MR BLUDWORTH
Once the premonition has started
whoever was put on the list stays
on the list until Death finishes
them all off and then his job is
done

DEREK
Fuck this Why are we even fucking
with Death huh Look if it’s our
time to go it’s our time to go
right I’m going back to the truck
I’ll wait for y’all

Derek walks out of the room and back down the hallway from
where they came

TUCKER
I’m going to wait with him You
know just in case anything happens
to him

Tucker leaves but Cara and Wes stay

TYLER
Why is this happening to me Why
was I chosen to go through all of
this

MR BLUDWORTH
Death chooses randomly Tyler Like
pulling names out of a hat Once
he’s chosen a certain amount of
people he sets them down on a
list

Mr Bludworth begins cleaning his operation tools

MR BLUDWORTH (CONT’D)
»Or maybe he’s coming back to
finish his duty

TYLER
What do you mean

MR BLUDWORTH
Tyler have you ever cheated death
before Not like you did the day of
the bridge collapse but just on a
normal day without any signs or
anything

Tyler thinks back

TYLER

WhenI was younger about 15 my
older brother and I were walking to
a gas station just to hang out and
by some snacks We were waiting to
cross the street to get to the
station unaware of the police
chase further down the road

DISSOLVE TO

EXT GAS STATION - FLASHBACK - DAY

A younger Tyler stands at the light watching the crosswalk
sign turn from a red hand to a white walking person His
older brother stands next to him Police sirens can be heard
in the background

TYLER (VO)
The light turned red and that’s
when we were able to cross the
street

Tyler and his brother begin to cross the street walking
normally Down the road a car speeds down the road towards
the crosswalk They reach the middle of the crosswalk when
Tyler’s brother sees the speeding car with the police behind
it

Tyler oblivious to the car is right in its path Tyler’s
brother pushes Tyler away onto the ground but before he can
jump out of the car’s path it hits him A little bit of
blood splatters on Tyler and Tyler’s brother hits the ground
hard his body twisted up

TYLER (VO) (CONTD)
We were both going to be hit by the
car if he didn’t push me out of the
way

Tyler looks up and sees his body His face shows neither fear
or sadness

CUT TO

INT MORGUE - DAY

MR BLUDWORTH
See Tyler your brother did what
you did with Wes He intervened
pushing you out of the way making
you cheat death And now he’s come
to pick up the pieces

Tyler looks up at Mr Bludworth

TYLER
But why did he choose dozens of
innocent people to die with me
They didn’t deserve it

MR BLUDWORTH
Death can be unfair at some points
but it needs to happen Death is
just another part of life Tyler

TYLER
Then fuck Death Fuck life Why
even bother coming here Everything
would be better off if I just got
onto the bridge like the
premonition intended We wouldn’t
have gone through all of this

Tyler walks out of the morgue

CARA
Tyler wait

Wes and Cara look at Mr Bludworth who is getting ready to
leave them Wes walks up and grabs his arm

WES
How do you know so much about this
kind of stuff

Mr Bludworth smiles

MR BLUDWORTH
It’s happened to me before

Mr Bludworth whistles a tune as he walks out leaving Wes
and Cara staring at him as he leaves

EXT TRUCK

Tyler stomps angrily to his truck with Derek and Tucker
walking up to him

TYLER
Come on We’re going home

DEREK
What did he say

TYLER
Nothing useful Come on

Derek gets in the passenger seat while Tucker gets in the
back Wes and Cara walk out of the morgue Wes gets in the
back but Cara walks around towards Tyler’s window

CARA
Tyler you can’t stop now Two
people are dead

TYLER
That’s the point They’re dead
because of me I couldn’t have
stopped it

CARA
No you can stop it You all can
intervene each other

TYLER
And then what Do that until we’re
old and finally die of old age or a
heart attack or a stroke

CARA
No but at least we can save lives
by doing so
Tyler starts his truck up and Cara climbs inside He backs
out of the driveway

INT TRUCK

Everyone is quiet until Tucker speaks

TUCKER
Is he sure there is no way we can
stop this

WES

He seemed to know a lot about Death
so I’m pretty sure he’s right about
what he said

The truck becomes quiet again Derek sighs
DEREK
We can talk about this later Can

we stop somewhere to eat

TYLER

Sure
EXT RANDY’S - DAY
Tyler pulls into the parking lot and parks his truck The
five get out and walk into the restaurant
INT RANDYS
They sit down at a table and wait for their server A
WAITRESS walks up to them her hair in a bun dressed in a

yellow skirt and blouse with a pencil behind her ear

She pulls the pencil out from behind her ear as she flips her
notebook out

WAITRESS
Hey all welcome to Randy’s What
would you like to drink

TYLER
Just get water for all of us

The waitress nods and hands them menus

WAITRESS
Our special today is salmon cooked
to perfection and our soup of the
day is broccoli cheese soup I’1l
be back with your drinks

CARA
Thank you

The waitress walks away and everyone looks through their
menus

TYLER
There has to be a way to stop it
there just has to

WES
Tyler you heard the guy you can’t
stop Death You can cheat him but
you can’t stop it

TYLER
We can figure out a way I don’t
know about you guys but I don’t
want to live the rest of my life
knowing when I’m going to die

Tyler looks around and sees a few people staring at him He
looks at his menu

The waitress comes back to the table with five waters She
sets them down in front of everyone and pulls out her
notebook again

WAITRESS
Alrighty then what would y’all
like to have today

CARA
I’1l just have the Broccoli cheese
soup

WAITRESS

Small or large
CARA
Small please
WAITRESS
(To Wes)
And you sir
WES
Oh I’m really not that hungry
TUCKER
Yeah neither am I
CARA
Tucker you need to eat
TUCKER
I’m not hungry Cara okay
TYLER
I’1l just have a small salad thank
you
WAITRESS
(To Derek)

And what about you
Derek looks at the menu a little longer

DEREK

Ill have the salmon and does that

come with any sides

WAITRESS
It comes with steamed vegetables
only

DEREK

Oh well that soundsgood
He hands her the menu

DEREK (CONTD)
Oh and do you put butter on the
vegetables

WAITRESS
Yes we do

DEREK
Can you hold the butter on this
order

WAITRESS
No problem Your food will be here
shortly

The waitress walks away and Tyler leans in towards Derek

TYLER
Why can’t you have any butter

DEREK
I’m lactose intolerant Just a
little bit of any dairy product
would make me have an allergic
reaction which isn’t a pretty

sight

WES
I thought you lose the allergy as
you age

DEREK

Yeah unfortunately I’m one of the
10-15 of the people who don’t

WES
That sucks

INT RANDY’S KITCHEN

The waitress hands one of the cooks the orders The cook
takes it and clips it to a hanger so he can easily see it He
begins working on Derek’s meal first He grabs a stick of
butter and is about to stick it in a pan with vegetables on
it he reads the order and sees that he needs no butter

He sets the butter on a shelf above the stove above the pan
of vegetables He begins working on the salmon while the
vegetables sit on the pan Heat from the stove begins to rise
up towards the shelf and the butter becomes soft and mushy

The butter begins to leak out of its packet and moves towards
the end of the shelf The chef begins working on the broccoli
cheese soup The butter reaches the edge and begins dripping
off onto the vegetables splashing and soaking into the
veggies

The flow of the butter gets faster and more and more of it
begins dripping onto the vegetables

INT RANDYS
Derek stands up

DEREK
I’m going to the bathroom real
quick

He gets out from the booth and walks past a WET FLOOR sign
slipping but catching himself on a table He knocks a few
knives and forks on the ground and Tyler stands up Derek

gets up and chuckles a little Tyler slowly sits back down

DEREK (CONTD)
My bad

Tyler watches Derek go into the bathroom and he looks at the
other three

TYLER
He’s next

CARA
What

TYLER

He’s next on Death’s list I don’t
want him to know It’s not going to
make things any easier

TUCKER
How do you know

TYLER
I saw him die in my premonition
Tucker I saw him get killed

WES
Are you sure he’s next

TYLER
I’m pretty sure

TUCKER
Yeah but if he dies then I’m next

CARA
No no no no you’re not next
Nobody’s next You can do this you
can save each other

TYLER
Yeah Cara For how long Sooner or
later Death is going to find
another way like it did with
people in the past yearsLike it
did with me

Tucker holds Cara close to him

TYLER (CONTD)
After my brother died I haven’t
been able to sleep well Every time
I closed my eyes I’d see my
brother’s body on the ground

WES
But he saved you He gave you a
second chance and when you made us
avoid the bridge collapse you gave
yourself a third chance

TYLER
Yeah but how many more chances are
we going to have Because sooner or
later we’re going to have to die
We can’t live forever

CARA
Well like the mortician said
death is just another part of life

INT RANDY’S KITCHEN

The butter’s dripping slows down to a stop just as the cook
gets a spatula and scoops up the vegetables that got buttered
the most He scoops them onto a plat along with the salmon
and sets the plate on a counter along with the broccoli
cheese soup and the salad

The waitress takes the plate and sets it on a tray She
carries it to the table

INT RANDYS

The waitress sets the plates down on the table as Derek walks
back He sits down and the waitress walks away Those who
ordered food begin eating

Derek stuffs a few vegetables in his mouth and begins to
chew but an expression of disgust comes to his face Tyler
looks at him

TYLER
You okay

DEREK
YeahI don’t think these
vegetables were cooked long enough

WES
So if you had an allergic
reaction how long would it take
for it to happen

DEREK
It usually happens in a few
minutes but sometimes there can be
delayed reactions so it could
happen in a few hoursIn days

even
WES
That sucks Have you ever had one
before
DEREK

Yeah I’ve had a few They’re hell
most of the time

EXT ROAD - DAY

A woman drives her car up a slanted hill and parks on the
side of the road She gets out and walks towards a house A
few yards behind the car is a stop sign

INT RANDY’S - LATER

Everybody’s dishes are clean Tyler leaves money on the table
and they get up and walk out

TYLER
Okay look I usually get these
signs before someone dies If I’m
able to follow them correctly then
I can probably be able to
intervene That is if I get there
in time unlike last time

Everyone becomes quiet They walk out of the doors

EXT RANDYS

They walk to the truck and Derek opens the passenger door

DEREK
Hey Tyler you don’t happen to
know who is next on the list do
you

Tyler stops what he’s doing and looks at Derek He looks back
at the other three and back at Derek

TYLER
Let’s just get in the car and go
home

DEREK
Wait what’s going on I just want
to know

Derek looks at the three in the back

DEREK (CONTD)
It’s me isn’t it Am I next

CARA
Nobody’s next

DEREK
Just tell me what you know Tyler

WES
It isn’t going to make things any
easier Derek

DEREK
Oh my God

Tyler backs up out of the parking lot and drives out onto the
road

TYLER
Look I haven’t gotten any signs or
had any bad feelings or anything
Right now we’re good

DEREK
Yeah but for how long

TYLER
I don’t know None of us know
okay

DEREK
Shit

They stop at a red light and a truck stops next to them
Tyler looks at the truck and reads the side “KRITTER
KILLERS” it says Tyler focuses on the word “KILL” in
“KILLERS”

Below it it says “You Got the Jitters We’ll Stomp those
Critters” The M in “Stomp” has been smudged leaving it as
“Sto-p” The light turns green and the truck turns left as
Tyler continues straight

EXT ROAD

A garbage truck hits a bump in the road a piece of sharp
metal falling out of it and clattering on the road its
sharp jagged edges sticking up The garbage truck begins
going up the slanted hill where the woman had parked her car

The woman’s car’s parking break is released and it slowly
begins rolling downhill towards the stop sign It backs into
the stop sign bending it forward at a slanted angle
sticking out over the road

INT TRUCK

Wes rolls his window down and sticks his head out letting
the wind blow in his face Derek’s stomach suddenly rumbles
He groans rubbing his belly

TYLER
You okay

DEREK
No I don’t feel so well

Derek begins scratching his neck and face His skin starts
turning red and puffy

CARA
Oh my God Derek Your face

Derek flips down the visor and looks in the mirror His face
is getting red and buldgy

DEREK
Damn it I think I’m getting an
allergic reaction

TYLER
You didn’t eat or drink any dairy
products did you

DEREK
No Oh GodI’m gonna blow

Tyler rolls down the window for Derek and he leans out
gagging Wes disgusted sticks his head back in but leaving
his window down

Tyler tries to concentrate on Derek and the road together
when his radio turns on by itself He looks down at it
“Stop” by Plain White T’s begins playing on the radio Tyler
stares at it unaware of the piece of metal right ahead

Tyler runs over the piece of metal puncturing his front
right tire Tyler swerves to the right making Derek fall
further out of the window Tyler tries to regain control but
he can’t The punctured tired makes Tyler swerve to the right
again

The three in the back bounce around hanging onto each other
They reach the slanted hill where the bent stop sign is The
sign skims Tyler’s truck scratching it It’s too late for
Derek as the stop sign slices through his neck chopping his
head off

Blood sprays through Wes’s window splattering on Wes
Tyler’s truck comes screeching to a stop when Derek’s head
bounces on the back of the woman’s car The rest of Derek’s
body falls out of the window as Wes screams terrified
looking at the blood sprayed on him

EXT TRUCK

They get out of the truck nobody getting out on Wes’s side
where Derek’s body lays They walk over to the blood-stained
stop sign and sees Derek’s body lying on the trunk of the
woman’s car

Cara looks away and Tucker tries comforting her Tyler runs
his fingers through the air his eyes getting watery Wes
falls to the ground and sits against the truck’s tires

INT ROOM - NIGHT
Derek lies on his back staring up at the ceiling his hands

behind his head He takes in a deep breath and sits up just

Tylers phone rings He pulls it out and flips it open It’s
another text message from Wes He opens it and reads “Look

He motions to Tyler to come down Tyler gets up and begins
walking down the bleachers

Wes is silent for a few seconds

WES

TYLER
Not unless we can find a way to
avoid all of this

WES
How I’m with you on this one we
can’t continue intervening each
other until we’re old Death is
going to continue coming after us
until he finishes us all off

TYLER
But if we find a way—

WES
You heard what the mortician said
Tyler You can’t stop death

TYLER
But he said you can overcome Death
for a while

WES
A while Tyler And even if we do
do you think that’s going to bring
everyone back Derek Leslie
Daisy

Tyler gets frustrated

TYLER
Fuck you Wes

Tyler begins to walk away but Wes grabs his shoulder

WES
What I’m trying to say is that

WES (CONTD)
There’s a basketball game tomorrow
night here at the gym Tucker’s in
the game You’re going to need to
be there just in case anything
happens If you happen to save him
call me immediately okay

TYLER
You’re not going to be there

WES
I don’t want to be there because
if you end up getting killed while
trying to save Tucker I’m not
waiting for my death to happen

TYLER
I’m starting to think you’re the
one becoming paranoid here not me

WES
Don’t fuck around

TUCKER
I’1l give you a call

up and walks over to it staring at the snapshots

Theyre pictures of old friends and those who avoided the

of Cara Tyler and Wes Tyler breathes in deeply and smiles
a little but the smile fades away

Thunder crackles startling Tyler and making him drop the
picture The picture falls into a paper shredder getting
pulled in and sliced up Tyler quickly grabs the photo and
Manages to pull it out Cara’s face shredded up while Tyler’s
and Wes’ are unscathed

the sky More thunder rumbles the earth and Tyler stares at
it angrily He throws onto his desk and lies on his bed
staring up at the ceiling

to rumbles on the edge of the shelf Tyler turns the page and

magazine He reaches over and grabs the cup drinking it all
in one gulp

He sighs and throws the magazine on the ground He stares out

at the lights Tucker grabs the ball and runs for his goal

By the force of the slam dunk a bolt from the goal loosens
The other team scores and Tucker passes the ball to one of
his teammates His teammate runs across the court passing it
to another player He throws it at the goal and hits the
board making it in the basket

The loose bolt falls out and onto the floor unnoticeable to
anyone Another bold loosens The crowd stands up cheering
Cara stands up trying to look over everyone

The game continues as the clock ticks down Cara gets a text
message It’s from Wes It says “Meet us out front” Cara
nods and begins walking down the bleachers Tucker looks over
at the stands and sees Cara leaving He frowns but continues
with the game

paint thinner letting Tucker past

INT GYM

Cara reaches the bottom of the bleachers and begins heading
towards the door

On the other side a man walks through the doors with two
cups of water He trips and accidentally splashes water on a
woman and the wall behind her

The woman gasps and pushes him as water slips into one of the
switches that lowers and raises the basketball goals Tucker
throws the basketball at the goal missing it and hitting the
top bouncing off

Sparks spray from the switch The other loose bolt falls out
and the basketball board falls to a horizontal plane The
goal begins to rise The basketball flies behind the rising
goal and gets stuck between too columns

All the players look at the goal beginning to rise in awe
One of the basketball ANNOUNCERS break in through a
microphone

ANNOUNCER
Uh folks we seem to be going
through a malfunction We’1l take
care of it immediately

Cara pushes the doors open but stops and looks at her
reflection in the door window A black shadow slowly fills up
the space in the window She turns around and sees nothing

The goal rises to the very top of the ceiling the metal
wires pulling it up untwining apart

TEAMMATE
(To Tucker)
While they’re fixing the goals
let’s get the ball down

TUCKER
It’s too high

TEAMMATE
There’s a ladder over there We can
use it

Tucker runs over and grabs the ladder taking back towards
where the ball is stuck He sets the ladder tests it to make
sure it’s sturdy and begins climbing up

Cara walks towards the court and looks up where the goal is
The light next to it begins to flicker

CARA
Tucker

Tucker grabs the ball but is unable to pull it out It’s
really stuck between the columns

The metal wires continue to untwine and the goal begins to
shake Suddenly they snap and the goal begins to swing
downwards

CARA (CONT’D)
Tucker

Cara runs over to Tucker as he pulls the ball out and turns
forward The basketball goal breaks through its hinges but
is still connected to the ceiling and slams into the wall
chopping Tucker’s body in half

Blood sprays on Cara and on the goal and blood pours out of
Tucker’s mouth Everybody screams as his legs fall from the
goal and onto the ground organs spilling out onto the floor
The top half of his body falls over onto the goal and the
goal swings back and forth

Everyone in the stands begins running out of the gym Cara
begins crying as she backs away staring at Tucker’s lifeless
body The people run out of the gym someone knocking over
the paint thinner and spilling it on the floor

The paint thinner begins moving in an arch on the floor
slithering quickly towards the helium tank

EXT SCHOOL

Tyler and Wes run towards the school but slow down when they
see terrified people pouring out of the doors Tyler begins
running to the school again Wes slowly following behind

INT GYM

Cara slips on the paint thinner and falls to the ground
Tucker pushes himself through the crowd trying to get
through He sees Cara

TYLER
Cara Cara hold on

He sees Tucker’s dead body and covers his mouth

TYLER (CONTD)
Oh my GodOh my God

He continues to push his way through the crowd Cara begins
to stand up when the light fixtures above her begin
flickering Tyler sees a light fixture shaking and getting
loose

TYLER (CONTD)
Cara

The light fixture falls and Cara looks up watching it get
closer to her It lands on the ground on the paint thinner
knocking her back The sparks ignite the paint thinner and
the flames race down the trail

The flames reach the helium tank and engulf it while the
other trail of flames reaches the container creating high
flames which light the banners on fire Tyler is able to push
his way through and he runs over to the wall of fire

TYLER (CONTD)
Cara hold on Just stay there

He runs over to the fire extinguisher but the flames have
heated up the handle making it too hot to open up Tyler
swears and runs back to Cara He stops

Tyler’s eyes get wide He looks up at Cara

TYLER
Cara Cara you were supposed to be

The flames jump up at Tyler’s face He jumps back Tyler
looks over at the helium tank and sees it on fire

TYLER (CONTD)
Shit

The banner is slowly lit on fire burning away slowly The
air conditioning comes on and the banner begins to flow
forward detaching from the wall and flying over Tyler It
lands on the ground and blows over towards the other side of
the gym where it touches other banners spreading the fire

Tyler watches the fire spread throughout the gym He looks
back at Cara who’s in tears

CARA
Tyler hurry The fire’s getting
closer

Tyler looks around the area he is in He looks back at the
fire extinguisher then at the helium tank then at Cara

Tyler runs over to the fire extinguisher and lays his hand on
the handle By reflex he pulls his hands back He takes in a
deep breath and grabs the handle firmly his skin boiling
beneath Screaming he pulls the door open and pulls the fire
extinguisher out

He drops it looking at his hand It’s red bloody and
bubbly He picks the extinguisher back up and runs back to
Cara He begins extinguishing the flames

TYLER
Go Now

Cara runs through the flames where the extinguisher is
hitting Her pants catch on fire as she runs through and she
falls down trying to put them out Tyler drops the
extinguisher and it rolls into the fire

He runs over to Cara trying to help her put the flames out
A breeze brushes his neck and he turns back around and sees
the extinguisher in the flames He gets up and runs back
towards it reaching into the fire to pull it out but it’s
too late

The extinguisher blows up in his face blowing him back
against the wall

CARA
Tyler

Part of the extinguisher flies through the air hitting
another light fixture detaching it from the ceiling Wes
runs in and sees Tyler against the wall Then he sees Cara
and then the light above her breaking apart

WES
Cara look out

Cara looks back at Wes as the light falls towards Cara He
runs over to her grabbing her and beginning to pull her
back The light lands on her legs exploding into flames
catching her legs on fire

She screams trying to put it out but the fire is too big Wes
takes his jacket off and puts it on her legs putting the
fire out Tyler dazed looks up at Cara and Wes He tries
getting up but he hurt badly

Wes is about to run to Tyler when he stops him

TYLER

Hey look it’s been four years
since that last accident It’s
over Nothing’s happened and
nothing will It was your turn to

CARA
Second chance

Cara smiles The subway comes to a stop and people get on and
off The subway starts up again

CARA (CONTD)
Next stop right

WES
Yeah

Cara sighs and rubs her knees A newspaper blows across the
aisle catching Cara’s interest She watches it as it blows
down the aisle and she searches for anything that could of
caused it but finds nothing

MR BLUDWORTH (VO)
One cannot stop Death from doing
what he has to do but one can
overcome him for a certain amount

of time
CARA
Hey Wes
WES
Yeah
CARA
Are you sure Tyler got himself
killed
WES

Cara drop it already It’s in the
past we don’t need to think about
it anymore Nobody does

CARA
I know but

WES
But what

CARA
Tyler told me Tucker was probably
going to get electrocuted But he
was killed by the basketball goal
One of the lights fell causing the
fire

WES
What are you trying to say

CARA
What I’m trying to say is that I
don’t think I was supposed to die
in the fire That other light was
going to fall on me but you pulled
me back

Wes remains quiet

CARA (CONTD)
Which means that when Tyler was
blown back by the explosion you
intervened but pulling me away from
the light which was bound to kill
me

There is a commotion at the end of the train Cara and Wes
look at the end of the cart WENDY CHRISTENSEN is screaming
at her friend KEVIN FISCHER and her sister JULIE CHRISTENSEN

WENDY
We gotta get out

Kevin jumps for the emergency brakes but they don’t do a
thing

KEVIN
It’s not working Somebody stop the
train

Cara and Wes look at each other terrified Wendy tries
opening the doors as does Julie but it’s no use The subway
derails and Cara and Wes scream as they fall out of their
seats the lights bursting and sparks raining down

The front of the subway explodes and breaks in half Debris
and other objects are flung through the air like bullets Wes
slides down the aisle The train slams into a column
stopping for a moment Wes flies out the opening and onto the
track

The train continues moving the wheel disconnected from the
tracks Wes looks in front of him the wheel coming towards
his head He screams and the wheel runs over him just as
we
