FADE IN

EXT SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

VERONICA SAWYER a sullen seventeen year old beauty is
jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit
Evocative female voices can be heard softly wailing

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY

VERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park running with an
increasing sense of desperation The female voices wail louder

EXT PROMENADE --DAY
VERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre
EXT THE SAWYER HOME--DAY

Reveling in her own sweat and agony VERONICA bounds onto
the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home
She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as
the female moans swell to a deafening summit The evocative
wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob

INY VERONICAS BEDROOM--DAY

VERONICA zips into a chic but understated ensemble as she
launches into voice-over narration

VERONICA (VO)
Heather told me she teaches people
Real Life

Composed and unsweaty VERONICA fingers her bangs in the
mirror then rambles off

INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY

Continuing her narration VERONICA glides through a bustling
high school hallway with a frozen smile

VERONICA (VO)
She said Real Life sucks Losers dry
If you want to fuck with the eagles
you have to learn to fly

OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA

With her back turned to the viewer VERONICA stands at the
outskirts of the cafeteria entrance The viewers viewpoint
approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that
she is writing in a diary wearing a monocle

VERONICA (VO)
I said so you teach people how to
spread their wings and fly She
said Yes

THE DIARY PAGE

VERONICAS pen sways across the diary page forming the words
echoed by her voice-over

VERONICA (VO)
I said Youre Beautiful

A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen
to recklessly rocket across the written words

HEATHER MCNAMARA (0S)
God come on Veronica
VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily
addressing the amusingly robust conventionally beautiful
trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA

VERONICA
Whats your damage Heather You
ruined my

HEATHER MCNAMARA
God Im so sure Dont blame me
blame Heather She told me to haul
your ass into the caf pronto Back
me up Heather

From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily
accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif HEATHER DUKE
She is clutching a tattered copy of The Catcher in the Rye

HEATHER DUKE
Yeah she really wants to talk to you

VERONICA
Okay Im going Im going Jesus

INSIDE THE CAFETERIA

VERONICA flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE
strides into the lunchroom pandemonium

The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her
toward her incoming comrades She is dressed stylishly and
expensively but not trendily her hair dramatically tied back

VERONICA
(submissively)
Hello Heather

Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper HEATHER
CHANDLER smiles The content of what Heather says is
consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks

is sexy dangerous and mysterious She is a mythic bitch

HEATHER CHANDLER
Veronica Finally Got a paper of
Kurt Kellys I need you to forge
a hot and horny but realistically
low-key note in Kurts handwriting
and well slip it into Martha
Dumptrucks lunch tray

VERONICA
Shit Heather I dont have anything
against Martha Dunnstock

HEATHER CHANDLER
You dont have anything for her
either Come on itll be Very The
notell give her shower nozzle

VERONICA
Tll think about it

HEATHER CHANDLER
(looking off)
Dont think

POV ON CAFETERIA LINE

Unattractive and quite overweight MARTHA DUNNSTOCKDUMPTRUCK
guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

VERONICAs arm seemingly involuntary latches onto the
outstretched pen

HEATHER CHANDLER
Splendid Ill dictate Veronica

Heather bend over

Both HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE bend over HEATHER
CHANDLER violently laughs

HEATHER CHANDLER
How nice Two assholes no waiting

HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect embarrassed

HEATHER CHANDLER
Heather Duke back down

VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE

HEATHER CHANDLER
Dear Martha youre so sweet

THE JOCKS TABLE
The traditionally handsome KURT KELLY the serene black EARL

FRAZIER and the massive RAM sit with other stereotypical
Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS
KURT
Itd be so righteous to be in a
Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler
sandwich Punch it in Ram

KURT and RAM raise their right arms and slam their fists
together

RAM
Hell yes I wanna set a Heather on
my Johnson and just start spinning
her like a fucking pinwheel

RAM makes a frantic spinning motion EARL is bored

EARL
Shit Right

RAM
Damn right right

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

In slow motion VERONICA finishes the note and rises up
along with her makeshift desk HEATHER DUKE

HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line
VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER
MARTHA DUNNSTOCKDUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then
grasping her lunch tray with both paws moves toward
VERONICA and the HEATHERS

HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLERS arm as

MARTHA approaches With a tranquil smile HEATHER CHANDLER
passes the note to her frantic disciple

In a self-consciously clandestine manner HEATHER MCNAMARA
saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the
note onto MARTHAs tray

The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles
past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin black

bespectacled DENNIS The guys are working a large stand

which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner
reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD

PETER
Come on people lets give that
leftover lunch money to people
without lunches Those tater tots
you threw away today are a delicacy
in Africa Theyre Thanksgiving dinner

HEATHERS TABLE

The Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and
HEATHER DUKE sitting themselves down first

HEATHER MCNAMARA

(looking to the stand)
God arent they fed yet Do they
even have Thanksgiving in Africa

VERONICA
(low key sarcasm)
Oh sure Pilgrims Indians tater
tots its a real party continent

HEATHER CHANDLER draws up a clipboard

HEATHER CHANDLER
Sawyer Guess what today is

VERONICA
Ouchthe lunchtime poll So

HEATHER DUKE

HEATHER CHANDLER
God-damn Heather you were with me
in Study Hall when I thought of it

HEATHER DUKE
(hurt)

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table
as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye

VERONICA
Hey this question wouldnt be that
bizarro thing you were babbling
about over the phone last

HEATHER CHANDLER
Shut up it is I told Dennis if he
gave me another topic that was
political Id spew burrito chunks
VERONICA shakes her head and looks off Shes suddenly
captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark
in a long tan gunslinger coat behind a Rebel Without a
Cause lunchbox They make eye contact

Transfixed VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN a slightly
overweight unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones

BETTY
Sorry Veronica

VERONICA
Betty Finn Gosh

VERONICA crouches down embarrassed and rueful

VERONICA
Im really sorry I couldnt make it
to your birthday party last month

BETTY
Thats okay Your Mom said you had
a big date Heck Id probably skip
my own birthday party for a date

VERONICA gently laughs at BETTYs innocent awe

VERONICA
Dont say that

BETTY
Oh Ronnie you have to look at
what I dug up the other day

BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY
FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER arm-in-arm dressed in Halloween
costumes BETTY is an angel VERONICA is a witch

VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows
VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor

VERONICA
I was talking with someone

HEATHER CHANDLER
Color me impressed I thought you
grew out of Betty Finn

HEATHER CHANDLER

COURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER
CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face
VERONICA HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth
doing the induce-vomiting signal before devouring the tot
and turning back around

COURTNEY

HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard VERONICA closes her
eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile

monocled VERONICA writes at her desk

VERONICA frenziedly scribbles trying to get her pen to write
She throws the pen across the room and pulls out another

than selfish reasons More than a
spoke in my menstrual cycle You
have to believe me

DORMITORY HALLWAY
The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLERs stylish garb clashes with the
laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS

BRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches
DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door

BRAD
So are you a cheerleader

VERONICA

No not at all
BRAD

VERONICA
Gee thanks

BRAD

BRAD
So when you go to college what kind

room and have a real party Ive got

A BIG AMIABLE STUDENT approaches before VERONICA can show
disgust

BIG AMIABLE STUDENT
Brad-man Robinsons looking for

BRAD

BIG AMIABLE STUDENT

BRAD

VERONICA

BRAD

With a wink BRAD squirms off VERONICA dashes into the room
with the coats

VERONICAS BEDROOM
VERONICA rampages through her diary

VERONICA (VO)
Seventeen is the last year Mom buys
the Twinkies When you make the
jump from working weekends at Pizza
Hut to thirty years at I1BM you
lose something Not innocence--power
JFK the cat jumps onto the Diary

VERONICA
JFK

VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues

VERONICA (VO)
Christ I cant explain it but Im
allowed an understanding that my
parents and these Remington University
assholes have chosen to ignore I
understand I must stop Heather

DORM COAT ROOM

Panting VERONICA collapses at a desk in the coat room
She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours
some in her beer cup slouching down in her chair

VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook She eerily
brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches
With an eek of pain she tosses the match away into the Vodka
cup setting it afire VERONICA laughs to herself before
tossing the flaming cup out the window

EXT ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY NIGHT

The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled
with other cups and various refuse The flames spread

INT DORMITORY BATHROOM NIGHT

A dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink
bathroom Using a glass off one of the sinks she gargles some
water and then spits it at her own reflection

THE DORM COAT ROOM
VERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door

BRAD

Hows my little cheerleader Now I

isnt so uptight come on

VERONICA
Hey really I dont feel so great

BRAD
Lets do it on the coats Itll
be excellent

BRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing

VERONICA
I have a little prepared speech I
give when my suitor wants more
than Id like to give him
Gee Blank I had a nice

BRAD
Save the speeches for Malcom X
I just wanna get laid

VERONICA
You dont deserve my fucking speech

VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed
causing him to slide off onto the floor

DORM HALLWAY

VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she
sees shes attracting attention She notices an incited
BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some
STUDENTS HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm

BRAD causes DAVIDs smile to ever-so-slightly diminish
DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set
down her beer and walk toward VERONICA

DORMITORY ALLEY
The fire in the trashcan is raging
DORM HALLWAY
A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA
HEATHER CHANDLER
Whats your damage Brad says
youre being a real cooze
VERONICA
Heather I feel awful like Im

going to throw up Can we jam please

HEATHER CHANDLER
No Hell no

VERONICAS eyes fall shut in a near-faint She flings
herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds
VERONICAS BEDROOM
VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary tears burning fierce

VERONICA (VO)
Betty Finn was a true friend and I
sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs
and Diet Cokeheads Killing Heatherd
be like offing the Wicked Witch of the
West Or is it East West I sound
like a psycho Tomorrow Ill be kissing
her aerobicized ass but tonight let me
dream of a world without Heather A
world where I am free

DORM HALLWAY

VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth
A smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLERs granite puss
VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background

DORMITORY ALLEY

VERONICA charges into the alley She whips around to face a
screeching HEATHER CHANDLER In back of VERONICA the
trashcan bellows like Mt Vesuvius

HEATHER CHANDLER
You stupid cunt

VERONICA
You goddamn bitch

The flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic light

HEATHER CHANDLER
You were nothing before you met me
You were playing Barbies with Betty
Finn You were a Brownie you were a
Bluebird you were a Girl Scout
Cookie I got you into a Remington
Party Whats my thanks Its on the
hallway carpet I get paid in puke

VERONICAS BEDROOM

VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the
wall behind the stunning figure of JD VERONICA gasps

JD
Dreadful etiquette I apologize

VERONICA
(exhaling deeply)
Sokay

JD
I saw the croquet set-up in the back
Up for a match

VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated She seems
ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead

VERONICA
Sure But Im Blue

EXT THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT

The viewers viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronicas
backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of
clothing A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest
together by the first wicket

JD (VO)
Goddamn no wonder you looked so
mangled when I came through the window

Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next
wicket

VERONICA (VO)
Ive always treated Heathers teen
queen power plays as bullshit

As VERONICA quiveringly pauses a stylish blouse and a
rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket

VERONICA (VO)
But Im really scared Who am I going
to eat lunch with on Monday I sound
like an Afterschool Special

The viewers viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans
resting side by side at another wicket

JD (V0O)
That was my first game of Strip
Croquet you know I thank you

VERONICA (VO)
Youre welcome Its a lot more
interesting than just flinging
off your clothes and boning away
on the neighbors swing set

VERONICAS blue mallet has been staked into the ground Her
panties hang on one end JDs underwear hangs on the other

JD (0S)
Well I dont know Theres
something to be said forOuch

VERONICA and JD are finally revealed entangled in an
artful pose upon JDs gunslinger coat They warmly kiss
VERONICA breaks off to uneasily giggle

VERONICA
What a night

JD gently bites in to VERONICAs neck VERONICA grooves on
it closing her eyes tightly

VERONICA
What a life I almost moved into high
school out of sixth grade because I
was some genius We all decided to
chuck the idea because Id have
trouble making friends blah-blah-blah

VERONICA slides her head down against JDs chest and
gracefully rests on his lap Gently fighting slumber she
murmurs up to JD who showers her face with slow kisses

VERONICA
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do I use
my grand I1Q to figure out what gloss
to wear and how to hit three keggers
before curfew Some genius

JD
Heather Chandler is one bitch that
deserves to die

VERONICA
Killing her wont solve anything
JD
A well-timed lightning bolt through
her window and Monday morning all
the other heathers shit everybody
would be cast fucking adrift

VERONICA
Well then Ill pray for rain

JD
See the condoms in the grass over
there We killed tonight Veronica
We murdered our baby

VERONICA
Hey it was good for me too Sparky

JD
Just saying its not hard to end a life

VERONICA
Theres a big difference between
the most popular girl in the school
and dead sperm

They laugh VERONICA maneuvers herself into a sitting position

JD
I guess I dont know what the hell
Im talking about

VERONICA
I know exactly what the hell youre
talking about and youre right you
dont know what the hell youre
talking about Lets just grow up
be adults and die

JD
Good plan

VERONICA
But before that Id like to see
Heather Chandler puke her guts out

INT HEATHER CHANDLERS BEDROOM--DAY

HEATHER CHANDLERs bedroom is lushly and expensively
furnished with a glass coffee table as an eye-catching
centerpiece HEATHER CHANDLER half-sleeps in twisted
bedsheets as MRS CHANDLER sticks her head in the door
MRS CHANDLER
We are leaving soon for your
grandmothers If you care to join us

HEATHER CHANDLER
Bag that

MRS CHANDLER
Is that a No in your lingo

As the door closes HEATHER CHANDLER raises her arm and
gives her departed Mother the finger

HEATHER CHANDLER
Lingo this

INT THE CHANDLER KITCHEN--DAY

The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before
VERONICA and JD burst through the door

VERONICA
(quietly)
Trust me She skips the Saturday
morning trip to Grandmas even
when shes not hungover

JD
Then lets just concoct ourselves a
little hangover cure thatll induce
her to spew red white and blue

VERONICA opens the refrigerator JD opens the cupboard
beneath the sink

VERONICA
What about orange juice and milk
Whats the upchuck factor on that

JD holds up a bottle of Pine-Sol

JD
Im a Pine-Sol man myself

VERONICA
Dont be a dick That stuffll
kill her

VERONICA and JD make queasy eye-contact VERONICA descends
back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as
JD suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent
scouring powder) into a glass beer mug

VERONICA
O-kay Well cook up some soup and put
it in a Coke Sick eh Now should it
be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon

JD
Man Veronica pull the plug on that
shit I say we go with Big Blue

JD raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue
liquid VERONICA stares at the glass scared by her own thoughts

VERONICA
What are you doing You just
cant go Besides shed never

drink anything that looks like that

JD
Okay well use this She wont be
able to tell what shes drinking

JD pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the

poisonously blue beer glass contents into it An eerie pause

ensues VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of
orange

juice She struts back to the counter in anger icily muttering

VERONICA
Just give me a cup jerk

JD sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup VERONICA
tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange
juice into the cup

VERONICA
Milk and orange juice Hmmmm Maybe
we could cough a phlegm globber in
it or something

JD
Yeah great

They both start coughing harshly

VERONICA
No luck Well milk and orange juicell
do quite nicely Quite nicely

JD
Chick-en
VERONICA
Youre not funny

JD turns on his heel and slinks away VERONICA glares down at
the mess of toxic containers With both arms VERONICA clumps
the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put
them away JD swaggers back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs
back into view

Im sorry

JD kisses the back of her neck VERONICA closes her eyes
with a grudging smile

VERONICA
Bonehead

VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups
Not the one with milk and orange juice in it

HEATHER CHANDLERS BEDROOM

HEATHER CHANDLER angelically sleeps as VERONICA and JD enter

VERONICA
Morning Heather

Like a lion HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up

HEATHER CHANDLER
Veronica And Jesse James Quelle

affection for regurgitation

VERONICA
We both said a lot of things we
didnt mean last night

HEATHER CHANDLER
Did we How the helld you get in here

JD
Veronica knew youd have a hangover
So I whipped this up Family recipe
JD holds out the ceramic cup HEATHER CHANDLER snorts

HEATHER CHANDLER
Did you put a phlegm globber in it
or something Im not drinking that piss

JD
I knew this stuff would be too intense

HEATHER CHANDLER
Intense Grow up You think Ill drink
it just because you call me chicken

They do Theyre right

HEATHER CHANDLER
Just give me the cup jerk

HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to JD in anger
She takes the cup slams her head back and downs it all She then
launches her head forward her face contorted in agony

HEATHER CHANDLER
Corn nuts

HEATHER CHANDLERS eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes
through the glass coffee table VERONICA and JD freeze

JD
Something tells me you picked up
the wrong cup

VERONICA
No shit sherlock I cant believe
it I just killed my best friend

JD
And your worst enemy

VERONICA
Same difference Oh jesus Im gonna

VERONICA staggers to a desk JD laughs out of shock

JD
What are we going to tell the cops
Fuck it if she cant take a joke Sarge

VERONICA
Stop kidding around Im going to
have to send my SAT scores to
San Quentin instead of Stanford

JD
Im just a little freaked all right
(a beat)
You got what you wanted you know

VERONICA
Its one thing to want somebody out
of your life Its another thing to
serve them a wake-up cup of Drano

VERONICA stares off as JD paces like a caged animal He
scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees
Cliff Notes for The Bell Jar plus a magazine proclaiming

THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN sticking out from beneath
HEATHER CHANDLERs body

JD
We did a murder In Ohio thats a crime
But if this was like a suicide thing

VERONICA
Like a suicide thing

JD
Adolescence is a period of life
fraught with anxiety and confusion

VERONICA
(calming down)
I can do Heathers handwriting as
well as my own

VERONICA takes some stationery from the desk and begins
writing calling out her words

VERONICA
You might think what Ive done is
shocking

JD

To me though suicide is the
natural answer to the myriad
of problems life has given me

VERONICA
Thats good but Heather would
never use the word myriad

JD
This is the last thing shell ever
write Shell want to cash in on as
many fifty-cent words as poss

VERONICA
She missed myriad on a vocab
test two weeks ago all right

JD
That only proves my point more The word
is a badge for her failures at school

VERONICA
Youre probably rightPeople think
just because youre beautiful and
popular life is easy and fun Nobody
understood I had feelings too

JD
I die knowing no one knew the real me

VERONICA
Thats good Have you done this before

VERONICAs smile dies as she looks to HEATHER CHANDLERS corpse
INT SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

At the head of a long conference table is the bearlike
PRINCIPAL GOWAN Circling the table is the gray-haired but
savvy MRS POPE the black counselor PAUL HYDE the yuppie math
teacher KEVIN STAPLES and most noticeably the eccentrically
dressed MS PAULINE FLEMING Coats are in chairs and cigarette
smoke is in the air as the group batters their way through a
morning mourning conference

PRINCIPAL GOWAN
Any other Principal would take the same
position Keep things business as usual

COUNSELOR HYDE
Heather Chandlers not your everyday
suicide She was very popular

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

I let the kids go before lunch and
the switchboard1ll light up like a
Christmas Tree

KEVIN STAPLES
The parents will be sympathetic sir
These are troubled times for the young

MRS POPE

I must say I was impressed to see
that she made proper use of the word
myriad in her suicide note after
brutalizing it in a vocabulary test

PAULINE
(dramatically cutting in)
I find it profoundly disturbing that
we are told of a tragic destruction
of youth and all we can talk about
is adequate mourning times and
misused vocabulary words

A collective sigh goes across the room

PRINCIPAL GOWAN
Oh Christ

PAULINE
The school meaning both students
and teachers must revel in this
revealing moment I suggest we get
everyone into the cafeteria and
just talk And feel Together

PRINCIPAL GOWAN
Thank you Ms Fleming Call me
when the shuttle landsNow is
this Heather the cheerleader

COUNSELOR HYDE
That would be Heather Mcnamara

PRINCIPAL GOWAN
Damn Id be willing to go half a
day for a cheerleader

KEVIN STAPLES
Lets just pack it in an hour early

PRINCIPAL GOWAN
Done I hate Mondays

INT PAULINE FLEMINGS CLASSROOM--DAY

The desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an
amusingly chaotic position by PAULINES PUPILS She is furious

PAULINE
I said a circle you imbeciles Forget
it Just sit down Im just so thrilled
to be given an example of everything
Ive taught you That example is
Heather Chandler I have the note

PAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note The class AAAHS
MALE STUDENT
All right

PAULINE
Ill pass the suicide note around
the room so you can feel its tragic
beauty for yourself Let us share
together the feelings the suicide has
spurred in us all Who wants to begin

FEMALE STUDENT
I heard it was really gnarly She
drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and
stuff then she smashed

PAULINE
Now now were not here to rehash
the coroners report Lets talk emotions

THE ALL-OUT NERD
Are we going to be tested on this

A stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks
The note continues to be breathlessly passed around

PETER
Heather and I used to go together
but she said I was boring I realize
now I wasnt really boring She was
just dissatisfied with her life

PAULINE
Thats very good Peter

VERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by
putting her hands over her face

PAULINE
Dear Veronica Heather was your
soulmate Share

VERONICA

Heather was cool but cruel The good
looks and bad manners gave her power
but it could not give her happiness

The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to
her She acknowledges it in horror passes it on then continues
realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience

VERONICA
She realized the only way she could
be happy was to give up her power and
the only way she could do that was death

PAULINE cries The PUPILS applaud VERONICA queasily smiles
INT THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY

HEATHER MCNAMARA pulls a Swatch from one of the lockers

HEATHER MCNAMARA

HEATHER MCNAMARA tosses the watch to a spooked VERONICA who
stands up and solemnly puts it on The FEMALE STONER IN ARMY
JACKET stops next to their bench

FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET

HEATHER DUKE bobs up from the worlds largest sno-cone

JD

and threatening in a shirt and tie He is rather
malevolently holding a rowing machine

FRED DEAN

The Brady Bunch sputters on the TV screen before him

PETER

Dizzy VERONICA hands a clump of dollar bills to PETER

VERONICA

PETER cheerfully pockets the cash as VERONICA drifts off
INT VERONICAS BEDROOM--DAY
VERONICA arousingly speaks into her phone
VERONICA
Hi Kurt This is Veronica Sawyer I

didnt expect to be calling either I
guess my emotions took over I was
wondering if you wanted all those
things youve been saying to really
happen Its always been a fantasy of
mine to have two guys at once
Sure you can write Penthouse Forum

Revealed to be lounging on her bed JD laughs out loud
VERONICA throws a book at him

VERONICA
Thats right tonight In the woods
behind the school Dont forget Ram

INT THE KELLY KITCHEN--DAY
KURT hangs up with an amazed expression on his face

KURT

VERONICAS BEDROOM

VERONICA and JD load guns on VERONICAs bed VERONICA
breaks into a laugh

VERONICA
I dont get the point of me writing
a suicide note when well just be
shooting them with blanks

JD
Get crucial We wont be using
blanks this time

VERONICA
You cant be serious Hey listen
my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over

VERONICA drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed
With a patient smile JD pulls her back down

JD
Do you take German

VERONICA
French

JD flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber
JD

These are Ich Luge bullets My
grandfather snared a shitload of
them in WW Two Theyre like
tranquilizers only they break the
surface of the skin enough to
cause blood but not any real harm

VERONICA
So it looks like the persons been
shot and killed when theyre really
just unconscious and bleeding

JD nods then stands to pace the room his mind whirring

JD
We shoot Kurt and Ram Make it look
like they shot each other By the time
Kurt and Ram regain consciousness
theyll be the laughingstocks of the
school The notes the punchline
Howd it turn out

VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse She also
plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurts handwriting of
the opening note-forge scene She proudly displays both
papers

VERONICA
First tell me this similarity is
not incredible

JD
(warmly)
Incredible similarity

VERONICA pulls back the note and reads

VERONICA
Ram and I died the day we realized
we could never reveal our forbidden
love to an uncaring and ununderstanding
world The joy we shared in each others
arms was greater than any touchdown Yet
we were forced to live the lie of Sexist-
Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole

JD
Exquisite but I dont think
ununderstanding is a word

VERONICA
We dont want to make them out to be
too secretly eloquent Why would the
Germans invent a bullet that doesnt
kill people I mean it was World War
Two not a school play

JD
(rapid-fire)
They used them on themselves to
make it look like they were dead
Really quite a brilliant device but
too flamboyant to seriously produce

VERONICA
Neat Lets try it out on JFK

VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable
tabby entering the room JD rips it away from her

JD
It doesnt work on small animals

VERONICA
Oh

JD
Uh well hey lets take a look at the
homosexual artifacts I dug up Now
prepare to be a little disappointed

JD lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the
contents on the bed

JD
Weve got a Playgirl a candy dish a
Joan Crawford post card and lipstick

VERONICA
You must have had fun

JD
You know it Oh man I almost forgot
The one perfecto thing I picked up

JD reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly
raises out two bottles of Perrier water

JD
Perrier water

VERONICA
Oh come on Lots of people drink
Perrier Its come a long way

JD
This is Ohio If you dont have a
brewsky in your hand after dark you
might as well be wearing a dress

VERONICA
(mock-seductively)
Oh youre so smart How about a
little heterosexuality before we go

JD laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss

EXT CLEARING IN THE WOODS--NIGHT

VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods
She nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT
and RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods

KURT

VERONICA
(forced cheerfulness)
Hi Guys Glad you could make it

RAM smacks his hands together

RAM
So do we just start fucking

VERONICA
Ive made a circle on each end of
the clearing Ram you come over here

KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him
A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at
the opposite end of the foggy clearing

VERONICA
When you get in the circle strip

The guys pause then slowly start taking off their clothes

RAM
What about you

VERONICA
I was hoping youd rip my clothes

RAM
Oh Good idea

KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies

JD almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead
VERONICA rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT Using
both hands she fires but misses completely KURT runs

away onto the path VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile

VERONICA

Shucks
JD races to VERONICA in a white sweat

JD
Did you miss him completely

VERONICA
(giggling)
Yeah but dont worry it was worth
it just to see the look on

JD
Dont move Ill get him back

VERONICAs laughter cuts off like a faucet Suddenly trembling
and confused she watches JD bolt into the woods

A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods

OFF THE PATH

JD with a cold efficiency weaves through trees

moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun
KURT runs back the other way with a strangled moan

THE CLEARING

VERONICA approaches Rams body with increasing shivers He
does not look bleeding and unconscious He looks bleeding
and dead dead dead

KURT barrels into the clearing as JD howls from the woods

JD
Now

In a burst of frightened animal instinct VERONICA whips
around and fires her gun right into KURTs chest

MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and JD ran out

from different cliques chanting to the beat of PAULINEs

gospel recital PAULINEs voice is replaced on the

soundtrack by the evocative female moanings of the opening scene

HEATHER DUKE
But she couldnt handle it

JD laughs Shes on the ball

JD

INT THE GIRLS BATHROOM

A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up
into the mirror In a trance she pulls her hair back Heather
Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon JD gave her

BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions Seemingly

hands using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKEs dress HEATHER
DUKE winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off

VERONICA violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off

table drawer and draws up another address book this one is
frayed and pink polka-dotted She peruses it and dials

VERONICA

EXT SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY

BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in

BETTY

BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up

BETTY

exciting as your other friends

VERONICA
Thats bullshit Just shoot

BETTY once again bends and raises

BETTY

VERONICA
(warmly)

BETTY finally shoots Feebly

VERONICA
Betty your daydreams are a lot
better than my realities believe

get your butt kicked
BETTY
Ronnie

VEONCIA gigglingly shoots but misses the wicket And instead
hits BETTYs ball Disturbed by the sudden dilemma she
determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTYs

BETTY
Hey youre not settling for the two
shots are you Knock me out girl
Its the only way

VERONICA
Its not my style okay

BETTY
Nice guys finish last I should know

VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTYs adjacent ball sailing
toward the porch and a statuesque HEATHER DUKE who does
not budge as the ball whizzes past her

HEATHER DUKE
Brav-o

BETTY FINN
(nervously)
Ive got to get going Veronica

VERONICA
Sure See ya

HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering
desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA who picks up a green mallet and
fragilely swings it her early robustness a forgotten memory

HEATHER MCNAMARA
Croquet wont be the same without Heather

HEATHER DUKE hustles back toward a passing BETTY FINN

HEATHER DUKE

HEATHER DUKEs red ball slams into HEATHER MCNAMARAs green one

HEATHER MCNAMARA
Shit

VERONICA
So did you call people to tell them

HEATHER DUKE savagely sends HEATHER MACNAMARAs ball into
the flower bed

HEATHER DUKE
Back off I called everyone even that
Stoner slut Felt like giving my phone
a bath I told Betty just nowDamn

HEATHER DUKEs shot swerves wide of the wicket

VERONICA
Youre so polluted Talking down to
people making fake notes

VERONICA blows her shot

HEATHER DUKE
I dont see what gives you the right
to lecture Ronnie You were
soulmates with Betty Finn until you
realized youre the cover of
Seventeen magazine and shes the
before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad

HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICAs and prepares
to send it

HEATHER DUKE
Some people just dont matter Why
should those who do carry their
weight Am I right

As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet VERONICA steps on her
own ball When HEATHER DUKEs mallet makes contact the two
balls slam against each other unmoving with a loud smack
VERONICA
No youre wrong Its not even
your turn

The depressed and disoriented HEATHER MCNAMARA laying
against a tree pipes in

HEATHER MCNAMARA
Shes right Boy croquets not

PETER DAWSON beams toward her wearing a Guest Pass

PETER DAWSON
Veronica I thought we lost you

VERONICA
I was waiting for my friend Betty

VERONICA looks at her watch then joins PETERs march down the

PETER DAWSON

VERONICA
Shucks thats a great idea Pete

They burst through the studio double doors
STUDIO

VERONICA and PETER take in a panorama of attractive clean-cut
STUDENTS from various schools chatting near Wine and Cheese
tables set up to the side of an impressive elevated

circular stage All STUDENTS are wearing pink armbands

PETER DAWSON
This is excellent but I thought we
were going to get equal representation
on this thind Geeks Gearheads
Out of nowhere a bubbling HEATHER DUKE knots a pink armband
around PETERs arm with a giggle

HEATHER DUKE
Theyre probably just being
fashionably late

PETER DAWSON prances off with a raucous laugh VERONICA stares
dumbfounded at the wicked homogeneity of the STUDENTS as HEATHER
DUKE ties a pink armband on her

HEATHER DUKE
Is this very or what Oh youve

HEATHER DUKE tugs VERONICA across the crowded studio floor to
where the WETC news set is situated Smoking casually in her
anchors chair is the beautiful WHITNEY JAMES

HEATHER DUKE

WHITNEY JAMES
Ah please sit down

HEATHER DUKE glides away VERONICA uncomfortably steps onto

VERONICA apologizes to a blissfully oblivious WHITNEY JAMES
VERONICA

Im so sorry I was led to believe there

and psychological types at this gathering

WHITNEY JAMES
Oh I was scared of the same thing Heather
The minute you try to deal with the actual
teenagers who have contemplated suicide
youre stepping into quicksand Quicksand
filled with bad complexions bad grades
bad parents bad drugs and all sorts of
doody nobody wants to hear let alone
bend down to clean up

WHITNEY JAMES tears open a bag of Corn Nuts and showers some
into her mouth She speaks as she sucks and chews

WHITNEY JAMES
Im not knocking teen suicide Its
exciting stuff My personal faves
are those kids from loaded families
grabbing the mike to whine how even
though they bagged a BMW on their
birthday theyre still quote-unquote
depressed Its ridiculous People who
say money cant buy happiness dont

WHITNEY JAMES titters VERONICA is a statue of mortification

seated WHITNEY JAMES whos tuning her electric guitar

VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and
the two female hosts as the cameras go on PAULINE singsspeaks
into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar

PAULINE
Our schools have been torn apart by
tragedy Lets fuse them back together
through love Lets clasp hands and
connect ourselves in one mighty circuit
like a dove

The students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp

hands VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through

a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the
stage

PAULINE (0S)
Lets begin a new happiness

VERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN He pushes up a
console lever causing the outer edge of the stage where the
circle of hand-holding students is to slowly spin around
the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES

PAULINE
with no more suicide

STUDENTS
(eeriely)
Oh yeah

Ripping off her pink armband VERONICA freezes Standing at
the wine and cheese table gunslinger coat and all is JD
He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast

JD
Holy traumatic experiences Batman
Im sorry you felt you had to put
yourself through all that shit I
told you it wouldntHey its in
the past already right

PAULINE
No more problems

Devastated VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIANs console

VERONICA
Oh yeah

VERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle
of handholding pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground
around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES

JD

WHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before
coolly leaning over to her microphone

DAN RATHER VOICE (0S)
Oh sure Ill bet even back when I

sex but they were simpler times The
Sherwood suicides tell the bitter
truth of todays young What a wasteOh

VERONICA snaps off the TV

MOM
Turn that back on

VERONICA
This condescending junk makes suicide
seem like a cool thing to do Hey

feel like shit Get the respect in
death youll never get in life

DAD
If were not going to watch that
program can I put on the game

MOM
Are you trying to tell me it is not
a troubled time for the nations youth

VERONICA
Everybody cares for youth but nobody
cares about Joey Blow When that news
reporter gets home hell scream at his
son for not mowing the lawn in the
right pattern

MOM
Im lost You dont get enough
attention you get too much attention
Which is it Where are your shoes

VERONICA
All we want is to be treated like
human beings not like guinea pigs
to be experimented on and not like
bunny rabbits to be patronized

DAD
I dont patronize bunny rabbits

MOM
Treated like human beings Is that
what you said little Miss Voice of
a Generation Just how do you think
adults act with other adults You
think its all just Doubles Tennis
Adults can be horrible to other adults
When teenagers complain that they
want to be treated like human beings
its usually because they are being
treated like human beings

VERONICA leans against the wall with a melancholy smile

VERONICA
I guess I picked the wrong time to
be a human being

MOM is embarassed for getting so involved She meekly
gestures to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile

MOM
Youll live Want some pate

(taking the knife from him)
This knife is filthy

JD
What in the hell do you think Im
doing Taking out her tonsils

VERONICA
I think I know Heather a bit better
than you okay If she was going to
slash her wrists the knife would
be absolutely spotless

JD grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife

JD
Hows this Can you see your
fucking reflection

She can and so can the viewer Tears well in VERONICAs eyes
She begins to shudder a shattered smile quaking on her face

VERONICA
Tomorrow someone else will move
into her place That person
could be me
(suddenly deliriously defiant)
Ha theres only one of us who knows
Heathers handwriting and if you think
Im doing another suicide note

JD

(laughing)
You dont get it do you Society
nods its head at any horror the
American teenager can think to
bring upon itself We dont need
gloves and does anyone really
care about exact handwriting

JD tears his gloves off with a giggle He takes a pen from
the kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad He
shoves the pen in VERONICAs hand and grabbing her hand
forces her to scribble LIFE SUCKS on the paper

JD
Perfecto Man Ive even got a
marked-up Catcher in the Rye
What else does a suicide need

JD pulls out the copy of the Catcher in the Rye and opens a
door revealing HEATHER DUKE asleep in an artful pose ona
couch MTV images from the TV flashing against her

JD
(raising the knife)
If youll excuse me

VERONICA
No-o

JD hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door VERONICA
races to the door wailing She maniacally rattles the doorknob
trying to open the locked door

INT AN ANOYNYMOUS TV

The sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild
African music thundering on the soundtrack as WHITNEY JAMES
ina TV screen maniacally addresses the viewer A shiny
number 4 flashes on and off in the corner

INT NEWSPAPERYEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

In speeded-up imagery DENNIS PETER and the YEARBOOK GIRL
manuever pictures of HEATHER CHANDLER KURT RAM and HEATHER
DUKE in mind-bogglingly countless ways in order to accomodate
them all on the same two page layout

INT FRONT OF THE CAFETERIA--DAY
With even more speeded-up imagery four STUDENTS wearing What
a Waste Oh the Humanity T-shirts toss out tons of black
armbands into a hungry crowd

INT FUNERAL HOME--DAY

The wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a
halt at the sigh of HEATHER DUKE lying serenely in a coffin
FATHER FAUST wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee
walks in front of her to address a sizable group of ADULTS and
STUDENTS sitting in foldout chairs before him FATHER FAUST
dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking

FATHER RIPPER
Eskimo

FATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air then holds up
the copy of The Catcher in the Rye

FATHER RIPPER
Heather Duke underlined a lot of
things in this copy of The Catcher
in the Rye but I believe the word
Eskimo underlined all by itself is
the key to understanding Heathers pain

VERONICA stands in a corner with an Oh brother look on her
face

FATHER RIPPER
On the surface Heather Duke was the
vivacious young lady we all knew her
to be But her soul was in Antartica
freezing with the knowledge of the way
fellow teenagers can be cruel the way
parents can be unresponsive and as she
writes so eloquently in her suicide note
the way life can suck Well all miss
Sherwoods little Eskimo Lets hope
shes rubbing noses with Jesus

HEATHER CHANDLER moves next to VERONICA holding a plate
of steaming spaghetti She is wearing nerdy glasses and
something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom

HEATHER CHANDLER
Is this turnout weak or what I had
at least seventy more people at
my funeral

VERONICA
Heather Wha
HEATHER CHANDLER
Oh God Veronica my afterlife is
s-o-o boring If I have to sing
Kumbaya one more time

VERONICA
What are you doing here

HEATHER CHANDLER
I made your favorite Spaghetti
Lots of oregano

With a squeal HEATHER CHANDLER plunges VERONICAs face into
the plate of spaghetti

HEATHER CHANDLER

in VERONICAs tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her
mothers voice continues to filter through the door Its all

launches to her desk opens her diary shoves on her

VERONICA leans back in her chair sweating She reaches in the
pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls
out the cigarette JD had given her eariler in the film She

puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back

in the blazer

EXT OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT

JD remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with
his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began

checks the bullets puts the gun back in his coat and heads
toward the house

one hand the Barbie doll in the other

JD
I cant believe you did it was
teasing I loved you Sure climbed

up here to kill you but first I was
going to try and get you back With
amazing petition

JD throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the
computer printout sheet petition then savagely rolls it out
on the floor It is filled with signatures of different
sizes styles and colors JFK blinks

JD
Its a shame you cant see what our
fellow students really signed

JD flicks open a switchblade He runs the blade beneath
the typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off
reavealing another typed paragraph

JD

Listen We students of Westerburg

bodies will be the ultimate protest

to a society that degrades is Fuck

blowing up the school Talk about your
suicide pacts When our school explodes

thing that infects a generation A
Woodstock for the 80s Damn we

MOM (0S)
Honey are you all right in there

JD swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window
MOM enters the room and seeing her hanging daughter
launches into frantic screams

MOM
Oh God I knew it No no I want my
baby back I should have let you keep
that job at the mall I was just afraid
of you coming home alone at night

VERONICA opens her eyes

MOM
I made your favorite Spaghetti
Lots of oregano

VERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains
hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath
her blazer and is tied around her waist She undos the waist-
knot and lands on her bed She quickly puts a small pillow
over the left-behind gun unnoticed by her dazed MOM

VERONICA
Hey Mom why so tense

THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE

Montage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner
plate to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her

JD turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music)
EXT FRONT OF WESTERBERG HIGH--MORNING

The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front
of the school STUDENTS pour out

EXT SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING
STUDENTS come out of their cars
INT HALLWAY--MORNING

Typically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of-

locker-action VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her
locker

A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt grabbing VERONICA

as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee

PAULINE
Veronica JD told me you
committed suicide last night

VERONICA
Where is he Wheres JD

PAULINE
We have to talk Whether to kill
yourself is one of the most important
decisions a teenager has to make

VERONICA
Get a job

VERONICA storms away to her nearby locker She swirls her locker
combination and opens it She glances down the hall and freezes

In the distance JD moves mechanically down the hallway
carrying a large gym bag wearing a Walkman
VERONICA climbs into her locker She closes it until it is
barely perceptibly ajar JD strides past the locker and into
the Boys bathroom

BOYS BATHROOM

JD smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door He
turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music

THE HALLWAY

The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class The bell
rings A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway

VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker She treads down
the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her

THE GYM

A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily
doing cartwheels on the gym floor On a small stage set up
beside them other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs
PRINCIPAL GOWAN says Testing into a microphone

JD toting the gym bag quietly opens the gym door and slips
inside He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath
the bleachers

THE HALLWAY
VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway
UNDER THE BLEACHERS

Using heavy black masking tape JD tapes a thermal bomb to a
steel support beneath the bleachers Other thermal bombs can
be discerned taped to other supports

THE EMPTY HALLWAY

VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway trying to
keep in control Suddenly packs of STUDENTS burst from
classroom doors behind VERONICA The excited swarms of
STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA who has braked her
troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers
She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic RODNEY looks down at
his clutched arm with a nervous smile

VERONICA
Rodney wheres everybody going

RODNEY
Its Friday

VERONICA
Oh my God the damn pep assembly

RODNEY
Yeah these things are pretty artificial
but at least we all get out of class

VERONICA ignores RODNEYs amiable attemots at conversation to
inquisitively move forward through the crowd

THE GYM

JD darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors
He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move
toward the gym He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby
set of stairs

THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM

VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS
heading for the gymnasium She stops to watch her classmates
file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of
dread She again latches onto a passing RODNEY

VERONICA
Rodney whats underneath the gym

RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops turns to VERONICA

RODNEY
The boiler room

VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd She topples a
couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the
staircase beside the gym

HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM

JD walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room
eyeing the pounding generators inside He stops at a heavy
steel door Placing down his gym bag JD proceeds to swiftly
pick the lock He swings open the steel door

VERONICA (0S)
May I see your hall pass

JD weilds around A sweating VERONICA moves toward him
pointing the bedroom gun at him
JD
I knew that loose was too noose I
mean noose too loose Goddamn you

VERONICA
Like father like son A serious-as-—
fuck bomb in the boiler room thatll
set off a pack of thermals upstairs
Okay so lets start by slowly putting
the bomb down on the ground

JD looks down at the gym bag already on the ground He
folds his arms and smiles VERONICA forcefully moves closer

VERONICA
Okay okay I knew that I knew that
Put your hands on your head

JD
You didnt say Simon Says

JD suddenly kicks out into VERONICAs stomach doubling her
over and causing her to drop the gun JD gracefully
retrieves it

THE GYM

The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the
bleachers earthily shouting giggling cheerleaders making
swaying pyramids valiant band members struggling to be heard
Various Jocks including EARL stand on the stage with
PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away

THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM

VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs
JD raises the gun to her head

JD
Live by the sword

VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking JDs gun hand
upward She then sails her right fist into his face The blow
annoys him more than it hurts him but JDs momentary loss of
composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder
right hook The blow sends JD stumbling back against the
boiler room jarring the gun loose

They simultaneously lunge for the gun VERONICA having the
better grip pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun
from JD she loses control of it flinging it down the hall
VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but JD moves his legs
scissors-style around her and trips her
THE PREP ASSEMBLY

The assembly mindlessly blares on Cheerleader HEATHER
MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around
a pair of opera glasses all intensely scoping out the
cheerleaders A group of STONERS toke away beneath the
bleachers one of them lackadaisically leaning against a
thermal bomb

THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY
A snarling JD stands up pulling VERONICA with him

JD
You think just because you started
this thing you can end it

JD violently kissesbites VERONICA While kissing VERONICA
sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall She closes her eyes then
savagely knees JD in the groin VERONICA bolts to the alarm
and pulls it down Nothing happens JD gasps

JD
You really didnt think Id forget
forget to disconnect the

VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun JD
grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door

A jostled VERONICA raises the gun JD howls then bounds
toward VERONICA causing them both to careen down the steel
steps of the boiler room At the same time he inadvertently
kicks the gym bagbomb down along with them The gun spins
from VERONICAs hand and slides away The bomb flies out of
the bag onto the boiler room floor A digital clock on

the bomb clicks on at 500459458

THE PEP ASSEMBLY

he frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing The Wave BETTY
INN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act

ll sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers
outing as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them EARL and
he other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening
before the crowd

tO MAH

THE BOILER ROOM

VERONICA and JD are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler
room steps VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting
position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb its
digital clock clicking to 300 VERONICA crawls to the gun and
levels it at a rousing-up JD

VERONICA
The bombs gone on JD How do
you turn it off Tell me

Fully standing JD flicks open his switchblade He gives
VERONICA the finger screaming in exploded saliva

JD
Fuck you

Seething VERONICA shoots up at JD blowing off the finger
Shrieking in pain JD drops the knife to hold this sudden
geyser of blood VERONICA achingly stands pointing the gun
The bomb clicks down to 225

VERONICA
Its all over JD Help me to stop it

JD
You want to wipe the slate clean as
much as I do Okay so maybe I am
killing everyone in the school
because nobody loves me You have a
purpose though Remember Lets face
it the only place different social
types can genuinely get along with
each other is in heaven

VERONICA fires the gun at JDs feet The bomb clicks to 149

VERONICA
How do you turn the fucker off

JD
Youre not listening People are
going to look at the ashes of
Westerburg and say theres a school
that self-destructed not because
society didnt care but because
that school was society Is that
deep or what Ill let you put it in
your diary babe Free of charge

VERONICA
The bomb asshole

JD
Just push the red button twice
Thats what stops it If thats
what you want babe

VERONICA
You know what I want babe

JD
What

VERONICA fires the gun twice into JDs throat Coughing and
moaning he splatters against a generator

VERONICA
Cool guys like you out of my life

VERONICA saunters to JDs writhing body

VERONICA
But babe dont worry these here
were Ich Luge bullets

JD closes his eyes and slumps to the ground VERONICA turns
to the bomb and crouches over it A lit green light is next to
a green button Above it an unlit red light is next to a red
button The bombs digital clock clicks to 0017 VERONICA
presses the red button twice turning on the red light and
stopping the clock VERONICA falls back into a sitting
position and sorely exhales tears streaming down her face

THE PEP ASSEMBLY

A cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music
plays The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow
motion as well

At normal speed VERONICA walks to the doors of the Gym and
peers in The panorama of roaring students posing jocks and
prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion
VERONICA walks away from the gym

EXT THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL DAY

VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges
outside of the school She closes her eyes to therapeutically
bask in the suns rays A slight smile trembles onto her face
A strange voice kills it

JD (0S)
Color me impressed

JD stands starkly in the distance before her blood spurting
from his throat onto his gunslinger coat He painfully speaks
through his assasinated vocal cords

JD
You really fucked me up Veronica

VERONICA
(vertigo city)
I thought Iyou

JD
Youve got power Veronica Power I
didnt think you had The slate is
clean

JD pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to
his torso The green light is on and the clock says 00100009

JD
Pretend I did blow up the school All
the schools Now that youre dead
what are you gonna do with your life

VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and
puts it in her mouth She then folsd her arms

VERONICA
Perfecto

JD raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks
to 000 Nothing happens An annoyed JD breaks out of his
crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm

THE PEP ASSEMBLY

The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-
down pep assembly into chaos Wailing students pour out of the
bleachers screaming less out of fear than a Whoa Dude sense
of excitement

THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school
with her arms still folded Only now her cigarette is lit and
her face and clothes are blackened in ash Flames flicker in
bushes behind her VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns
to go inside

INT THE FRONT HALLWAY
VERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling

students some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the
thrill of it HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces
HEATHER DUKE
Veronica you look like hell

VERONICA
Yeah I just got back

VERONICA tosses away the cigarette She then grabs HEATHER
DUKE by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around

HEATHER DUKE
What are you doing

VERONICA
Heather my love theres a
new sheriff in town

VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKEs red ribbon and ties it
around the hair of her own head She kisses HEATHER DUKE on
the cheek leaving a black stain VERONICA calls off

VERONICA
Hey Martha wait up

MARTHA DUNNSTOCKDUMPTRUCK revealed to be in an electric
wheelchair brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica confused
VERONICA walks up beside her MARTHA starts up her wheelchair
and accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway

VERONICA
My date for the prom kind of flaked
out on me so I thought if you
werent doing anything that night
we could go to the video store and
rent some new releases or something
Maybe pop some popcorn

MARTHA
Id like that

VERONICA
So would I

VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding down the hall
BogartRains style
