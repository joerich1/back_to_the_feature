FADE IN

EXT STAR-FILLED SKY - NIGHT

Studio logo transitions into a CONSTELLATION in space
Cam

pulls BACK as more stars enter frame forming a
starfield

SPLINTER (VO)
A sensei once counseled a grief-
stricken boy as his older brother

prepared to leave for battle
N STARS - Begin to see a DOZEN or so stars almost
forming a

zig-zagged line Cam continues to adjust

SPLINTER (VO)
He said Child why do you cry
You are both part of a family And
a family is a bond that cannot be
broken by war By strife By force
or neglect
N STARS - Cam slows its truck-out to a gradual stop as

we
see the pattern beginning to form As if following the
stars
pattern the CAM LOWERS as we find ourselves going into-
Ss

EXT JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS
A relatively modern village for a remote jungle Dawn
is

JUST barely beginning to break The morning mist
persists as

we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a

group
of VILLAGERS
(e)
N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down Her SON 8
runs

to her side Shes mad Her son cries

WOMAN VILLAGER
You monsters
UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES greasy men
holding
AK-47s and looking down with hardened indifference
OS we
hear an EVIL CHUCKLE The men part as we see-
- COL PANTERA A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man
walks
up between them Pantera leans down face to face with
her
PANTERA
We appreciate the generous donation
for the continued protection of
your village
ANGLE ON - Their jeep overflowing with the Villages
precious crops
WIDER - A tiny group of other villagers stand at a
safe
distance The Womans HUSBAND runs forward He
immediately

LUNGES at Pantera just as-
-SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS
pointed
at the Husbands chest Pantera slothfully grins He

leans
forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck
PANTERA
After all the jungle can be a very
dangerous place BAH-HAHAHAHA
They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle
LAUGHING
EXT JUNGLE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path Pantera
sits

in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in
around the
food The Jungle looms ominous around them

H
IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle
ceiling
high above as if from someones POV
ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the
road

ahead Slams on the brakes Pantera is thrown around

PANTERA
Idiota Watch where youre going

DRIVER SOLIDER
Theres a log on the road senor
(quietly to himself)
that wasnt there an hour ago

PANTERA
Well what are you waiting for

CORTEZ leaps out Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
and pulls it to the log roughly 15 feet away

EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus

DRIVER SOLIDER

D-d-dios mio
ON LOG - Cortez is gone Pantera wakes up

PANTERA
What WHAT IS IT
OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking Then WHOOSHING as
the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN and CRACKS the BURLY
SOLDIER across the jaw It wraps itself around his neck
Before he can react
- YOINK He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep landing

the ground HARD

URLY SOLDIER
OOF
Burly gets pulled backward away from the Jeep and into
the darkness He SCREAMS the entire way clawing the ground
ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now Last Soldier is in the

readies his machine gun

Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into

jungle CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in

PANTERA

COWARD GET BACK HERE
Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera He turns to

Nothing He reaches down and pulls up a MACHETE
PANTERA
SHOW YOURSELF DO YOU REALIZE WHO

YOURE DEALING WITH
ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall

to find him Tense Suddenly-
-a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him

n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the

of a flurry of fist and foot attacks His attacker is
off

Panicked

and
a

gritted

in

way too fast for the camera to keep up
Pantera falls back panting heavily Panicked He tears

into the dense Jungle

EXT JUNGLE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The Boy is still at the Village Clearing Suddenly -
- the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the

villagers panic and scatter VROOM The Jeep flies out
jungle and bounce-slows into the FG

Only there is no one driving it and it still has the
stolen food in it And the stolen medallion dangles from

rear view mirror

WOMAN VILLAGER
Its a miracle
The village rejoices The Boy steps aside for a beat

back at the Jungle Something catches his eye

This is the latest in a string of

Although the victims have been
criminals themselves the
Nightwatchers actions have been
identified as destructive and
overly-violent verging on the

overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the

Now THATS what Im talking about

Cruising the streets busting those

who hold themselves above the law

(movie announcer voice)

But they arent above HIS

in holding an in-process invention He looks up

DONATELLO
Mikey the mans practically a

Sounds like four turtles I used ta

ON DOOR - Raphael walks in his Nightwatcher costume no

in sight

RAPHAEL
Whatta we talkin about boys
Soundin a little too egghead fer
my tastes

PLINTER

Ah Raphael Your brothers and I

were just discussing the vigilante

Nightwatcher once again

(beat - concerned)

Where have you been Youve been

spending so much time away from

home lately
Raphaels on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already
His attention doesnt break from Donatello

RAPHAEL
I joined a book a the month club
(to Donnie)
So just whats your beef with
puttin dirtbags behind bars
Donnie Go ahead enlighten me

Splinter watches the growing tension with concern

DONATELLO

I have no problem with the

incarceration of those who deserve

it but if someone like

Nightwatcher has ultimate power

then who makes sure he doesnt

cross the line
Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS twirling them around
aggressively in mock battle

MICHAELANGELO
I think hes COOL

DONATELLO
Of course you would

MICHAELANGELO
(in bg oblivious)
Keeya HATCHAAAAAA

RAPHAEL
Sometimes there are lines that even
the police cant cross Someone has
to be willing to do what needs to
be done And to do that fear
becomes a weapon

DONATELLO
You are such a Neanderthal
Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don Don reacts quick
and startled eyes wide

APHAEL
I rest my case

s

PLINTER
(SCOLDING)
Raphael If bullying is the only
way to argue your point then
perhaps you do not have much of a
point to begin with

APHAEL
(gritted teeth)
Yes sensei
(to Mikey)
And quit touchin my stuff
Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikeys hands and storms
out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the
second floor

DONATELLO
(too-late-retort to Raph)
That was just a startle response
and isnt really an indication of
fear
Raph does the blah blah hand gesture from above
Enters his

room slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC
and its some annoying pop HIP-HOP song

RAPHAEL (0S)
AAAARGH AND STOP TOUCHING MY

Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family

APRIL
Ive been so grateful for the
opportunities youve given me
lately Id probably be still
selling antique curios if you

Winters throat
as Winters stands still and begins to LAUGH
Slowly the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
shadows Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS
They flank Winters who is just loving the theatricality of
it all
The Foot Ninja leap back Winters remains confident and
unmoving Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot

WINTERS
I believe we made a deal Karai I
expect you to honor it
(beat stares her down)
You do understand honor dont
you
Karai stews unblinking stare Of course she does

WINTERS

So I dont care what part of
muscle for hire you dont
understand I hired your muscle
Now exercise the ones attached to
your feet and

(closer - terse)
»get back to work
heavily

Karai slowly steps back Winters smiles wide reaches into
the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to

Ww
a Foot Ninja Then another to a second Ninja

INTERS

So I will double no no

TRIPLE your pay for your troubles

(stare down)

Are we cool

ON FOOT - They just stare back blank goggles Probably
seething inside Winters is flanked by Generals

WINTERS
Are we cool
The Foot dont move Tense Karai finally nods Terse

WINTERS
Ninjas No sense of humor
(to Generals)
So how did we fare
CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
wheeled into the light
Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
pallet on the floor We can barely make it out as being the
HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight

WINTERS
(close quiet)
So it begins
It SCREAMS Fights its restraints Tires Breathing

Winters approaches safely inches away from his fanged maw
Creature suddenly lunges forward Winters doesnt flinch He
merely grins at the creature

WINTERS
(to General Aguila)
Were there any problems
AGUILA speaks in a gravelly hardened voice He towers over
Winters by a foot Clearly the leader of the four

GENERAL AGUILA
None my lord
WINTERS
(to Karai)

You see now THATS a good soldier
You two should compare notes
Karai and Aguila stare at each other Karai obviously not

used to being handled like this

KARAI

44

Just what is this all about

WINTERS

Oh lets call it a scavenger hunt

(re Generals)

I now have the power and know-how
but I need the speed and stealth of
an organization such as your own
Not to mention an organization that

values discretion

KARAI
But of course

WINTERS

You see I have nine more beasts
like this that should be coming to
town very soon Thirteen in all to

be exact

The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor ON CEILING - We see

the top of a CAGE inserted over top

ARAI

creating a cell
glad

But why Why here Why now

WINTERS
Instinct mostly Theyre animals
at their core
(looks off distant)
And they recognize something

familiar in the air in the
stars

(BEAT)
What can I say Im a lover of
animals

The disk ROTATES WIDER we see that there are already some
cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor Filled
by darkened silhouettes of creatures that were probably

WwW
we dont fully see Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness

INTERS
So you go and get to know each
other And dont forget play
nice
The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door
They move to fight back but Karai waves her hand

KARAI
Not now Our business will be
handled at a later time

After they leave we pause for A BEAT on Winters
Quiet

Tired Contemplative

Its an insane chase with Raph trying to lose him as Casey
swings his bat trying to stave off the Stone General

A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat He looks
at it

CASEY

Um Raph
Raph sees the blade They manage to switch positions in mid-
ride with Casey driving and Raph in back Raph throws kicks
and punches at their pursuer when he closes in

from jumping the bike to the next roof

Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body

pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight
