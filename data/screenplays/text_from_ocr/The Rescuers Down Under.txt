(They fly even higher above the clouds Marahute throws Cody and
catches
him Cody is now held in Marahutes talons)

Woah

(Cody mocks an eagle screech he laughs as Marahute tickles him

they

cruise above the clouds which eventually open up to show the
ground

Marahute nose dives towards the ground and a stream she holds
Cody just

high enough above the water so that he is water skiing they
approach a

flock of birds Marahute lets Cody go and he skims through the
birds

scattering them Marahute grabs Cody just before he falls in and
then

put Cody right in front of her on her beak (pushing him from
behind)

attempts to

look at Marahute upside down Marahute moves some grass and
feathers to

show Cody her eggs)

Theyre very warm Are they gonna hatch soon

(Marahute ruffles her neck feathers in an affectionate manner she
sits
on the eggs and then looks out over her domain)

covering on

the eggs the wind picks up and blows a feather in Codys face he
looks
