INT HENDON SYNAGOGUE DAY 1

An Orthodox Jewish synagogue in North West London is bursting
with PEOPLE The Torah is in the arch The doors are closed

Everybody holds their breath as their spiritual leader the
old and frail RAV KRUSHKA (70s) steps up to the podium
helped by a younger Rabbi DOVID KUPERMAN tall
attractive (40s)

RAV KRUSHKA
In the beginning Hashem made three
types of creatures the angels the
beasts and the human beings

His face lights up speaking about the Torah

RAV KRUSHKA (CONTD)
The angels He created from His
pure word The angels have no will
to do evil they cannot deviate for
one moment from His purpose

The crowd hangs on his every word

RAV KRUSHKA (CONTD)
The beasts have only their instinct
to guide them They too follow the
commands of their Maker The
Torah states that Hashem spent
almost six whole days of creation
fashioning these creatures Then
just before sunset He took a small
quantity of earth and from it He
fashioned man-and-woman
An afterthought Or His crowning
achievement

The Rav looks weak but wants to carry on

RAV KRUSHKA (CONTD)
So what is this thing man Woman
It is a being with the power to
disobey Alone among all the
creatures we have free will

His strength is failing him He’s unable to speak for a few
moments He tries again more urgently

RAV KRUSHKA (CONTD)
We hang suspended between two
certainties the clarity of the
angels and the desires of the
beasts

(MORE )
RAV KRUSHKA (CONT’D)
Hashem gave us Choice which is both
a privilege and a burden we must
then Choose the tangled life we
live

1A

The Rav closes his eyes for a moment When he opens them he
stares at the crowd blankly He can’t continue
Dovid takes the Rav’s arm and starts leading him back to his
seat The Rav stops mumbles something in Yiddish about not
being able to see very clearly
And collapses
An instant of stunned silence then several MEN rush over to
the body
INT MORGUE FUNERAL RITES MONTAGE DAY 2

A HAND rips the right lapel of a coat This is Dovid who
watches the funeral ritual of the Rav

The CHEVRA KADISHA --almost silhouettes-- clean the Ravs
nails with small wooden sticks

They purify the body by pouring three lots of water
continuously

They put clay upon his eyes and mouth
They cover the Ravs head and clothe him

The Chevra Kadisha surround the Ravs body and ask his
forgiveness

They put the body into a coffin and nail the lid down with
two wooden sticks

EXT CEMETERY DAY 3

The burial Chants and prayers are uttered as the coffin is
cast into a hole CRACK

INT MANHATTAN APARTMENT NIGHT 4

RONIT KRUSHKA dances softly enjoying herself at an
intimate gathering in a trendy downtown apartment She is a
beautiful woman made irresistible by the abandon with which
she dances

Ronit holds her hand out to someone A GIRL joins her on the
floor

They dance moving closer until their foreheads touch A MAN
(30s) now comes over and dances with them both

warehouse type building

INT RONIT’S APARTMENT LIVING ROOMBEDROOM MANHATTAN DAWN 7

Ronit is in a t-shirt and pyjama bottoms She walks from the
living room to her bedroom The living room is sparse basic
and functional There is no element of family There are
stacks of large art books and some photographic equipment
piles of photo contact sheets on the floor Ronit walks into
the bedroom and perches on the couch next to a large window
She looks at the vast cityscape whilst taking out her ear-
rings and undoing her necklace placing them on the window
sill The view is of buildings a vast and lonely city Ronit
gets into bed She drinks some water and puts in a gumshield
to stop her grinding her teeth She lies down and tries to
sleep The water pipes start to make a noise

INT A PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO MANHATTAN DAY 8

The TATTOOED MAN nods A knock on the door a level above
Claudia goes up the spiral stairs Ronit looks around but
keeps taking pictures Claudia comes back down to Ronit
serious

CLAUDIA
Ronnie You need to speak to this
man

Ronit is about to protest but sees Claudia’s expression
Ronit goes up the staircase and looks to the door She sees
the silhouette of an older man an ORTHODOX JEW He wears a
hat and a long black coat Ronit puts her camera down and
approaches him She hesitates now he is framed by the door
almost a silhouette of another time She walks towards him
suddenly quietly terrified

INT A PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO MANHATTAN DAY 9

Ronit takes more photos of the Old Man But now Ronit’s hands
are shaking she is in quiet shock distracted but trying to
carry on The Old Man takes out a battered old silver
cigarette case from his back pocket

Are you okay Do you want to stop

Ronit stares nods

RONIT
No I’m fine

OLD MAN
- Okay

RONIT
Actually Can I have a cigarette

OLD MAN

and industrial below

OLD MAN

Ronit nods she doesn’t want to speak for fear of breaking
down The OLD MAN puts his hand on her shoulder for a moment

OLD MAN (CONTD)
--You’ll be okay The world stops
for a bit Then it starts turning
again

Ronit breathes and smokes looks down at the people who are
like ants beneath her

faster but again falls hard on the ice Finally she gives
up

INT ICE SKATING RINK DRESSING ROOM NEW YORK NIGHT 17

Ronit is about to cross the road but a door opens to the
house opposite and a SMALL GROUP of Orthodox Jews come out
Ronit wears a shirt that shows her cleavage As she looks at
the group she automatically does up the buttons to the neck

Ronit waits for them to leave half-hidden behind a tree
Then she crosses over with her large wheelie suitcase The
wheels sound loud in the silence The door is open

Ronit waits and looks at the open door A TEENAGE GIRL comes
out and sees Ronit and walks back inside Dovid Kuperman

unshaven tired and his lapel is torn He is shocked to see
Ronit there with her bags

with food

Ronit follows Dovid uncomfortable to find that her presence
doesn’t go unnoticed A MAN nods at her gravely a few WOMEN
turn to look at her openly and murmur but no one speaks to
her

Ronit looks around the room gets more stares She goes over
to the table and looks at the food instead -- the dishes and
the way they’re served it takes her back The young WIVES
obviously admire DOVID as a young and handsome leader FRUMA
HARTOG ( 60s) walks in she is in her thick coat and sees
Ronit

RONIT

Fruma puts her arms out and goes quickly to Ronit and hugs
her

He stares at Ronit

RONIT

HARTOG
Ronit How are you

Ronit shrugs stuck for words Hartog and Ronit evidently
have a troubled history but Hartog puts his hands above
Ronit’s shoulders indicating his awkward sympathy but not
touching her Hartog wants to cry about his brother-in-law
the Rav

HARTOG (CONTD)
May you live a long life

Hartog is tapped on the shoulder by an OLD MAN and relieved
he turns to talk to him

FRUMA indicates that she’ll hang up her coat and walks
towards the hall HINDA waves over fascinated at Ronit
who nods HINDA touches her heart and indicates tears down
her own cheek the gesture annoys Ronit Dovid approaches and
Hinda smiles a huge smile at him which Ronit registers
Hinda’s FEMALE FRIEND also gives Dovid a huge smile they
look at Dovid and Ronit intrigued then away as Ronit stares

Ronit cannot reply puzzled and quietly angry

FRUMA (CONTD)
Dovid nursed the Rav you know to
the end He was like a son to him
Never left his side But so much
pain It was a release It must be
so hard for you not to have said
goodbye

It’s all too much for Ronit She takes her cigarettes out of
her bag

RONIT
Excuse me Fruma

FRUMA
You’1l1 never conceive With the
nicotine Ronit And all these
mobile phones

Ronit walks away towards the kitchen Fruma turns concerned
to the WOMAN next to her

Dovid smiles Ronit smiles she appreciates his warmth Dovid
seems to be somewhat quietly battling with himself

RONIT
Will you take over at the shul

Dovid shrugs
DOVID
It’s too early to think of such
things

He pauses really takes Ronit in

DOVID (CONT’D)

Dovid
Ronit smiles that would be awful Dovid smiles Ronit is
trying to resurrect their old camaraderie and humour which

seems to be all but absent

DOVID
No No I didn’t marry Hinda

RONIT
Good So that leaves a hundred
identical to Hinda

DOVID
Don’t be cruel

Esti walks past them with some plates Ronit stares at her

stares straight back at Ronit who realises that they are

Ronit is amazed
DOVID

The Rav gave us his blessing
Baruch Hashem

ESTI

You disappeared

Esti leaves them to sort the spare room

DOVID
The hesped will be a big event
The Rav was so loved I don’t
know how I’m going to cope without

him
This is all too awkward for Ronit whose loss is more complex

RONIT
You and Esti got married It was
always the three of us

DOVID
You went away That left the two of
us

Ronit is shocked and quietly raging
RONIT
I would have come over if youd

told me he was ill

DOVID
The Rav didn’t want you to know

Ronit nods she feels rejected once more by her father Dovid
can see this and is sorry

DOVID (CONTD)
He became very frail He probably
didn’t want you to see him like
that

RONIT
You still should have called me
Then I could have been here

Ronit is confused and angry she struggles to contain
herself She lights up a cigarette Dovid opens a door for
her to step into the garden They really look at each other
Ronit doesn’t move outside

DOVID
This week has been harsh Ronit
Please

RONIT

My father just died

DOVID ( GENTLY)
I know I was there

Dovid looks away upset Ronit is lost Dovid drums the table
with his fingers tired blasted Ronit throws her lit
cigarette butt away and starts to walk away from Dovid She
tries to overcome her upset

RONIT
At least you told me he was dead

Dovid didn’t let her know but he lets this go by He is very
determined to make things good

DOVID

Ronit It is important that this
week is conducted with honour

It’s not a threat but a plea

RONIT
Honour

DOVID
That is the most important thing

RONIT
Absolutely

Dovid sighs real pain and trouble has arrived

INT DOVID and ESTI’S HOUSE THE LIVING ROOM DUSK 25

Dovid stands by the ritual candle Esti is behind him Hartog
stands beside Esti and Fruma beside him Still stunned Ronit
stands apart from them and back as the people gather around
him for the end of shiva

DOVID
(recites in Hebrew)
Your sun shall no more go down
nor your moon withdraw itself
for the Lord will be your
everlasting light and your days of

“Rav Krushka’s untimely death is
a crushing blow to Anglo-Jewry He
was a giant of the faith Sadly he
left no children”

Ronit looks up at Dovid hurt
DOVID
Lazy journalism That would have
upset the Rav

Dovid takes the paper from Ronit

RONIT
Childless

DOVID
It’s probably some twelve year old
reporter Forget about it

Ronit feels vulnerable all this talk of her father and she
is not really involved in any of it

RONIT
Everybody loves him so much I used
to wonder if I loved him as much as
all those strangers did Or
sometimes if I loved him at all

DOVID
Youre his daughter

RONIT
He was always closer to you

DOVID
He enjoyed teaching me

RONIT
I used to wonder how the two of you
could talk together for so long

DOVID
He’d talk and I’d listen Mostly
about the TorahTry to get some
sleep Ronit

Esti comes in and puts some hangers in the wardrobe a towel
on her arm Dovid loiters waiting for her to finish the task
and they can both go Esti puts the towel on the bed

Dovid indicates for Shmuli to come up into his arms He lifts
him up and takes him to the window They are familiar Shmuli
trusts him

DOVID (CONTD)
You see the line over there in the
sky Between the poles

Shmuli nods

DOVID (CONTD)
That’s the eruv

RIVKAH
It’s like a big circle around where
we live

AVI
It’s not an exact circle

Where’s the rest of it

RIVKAH
It’s all around us
You know how before we couldn’t
push the twins in their buggy on

bigger and it becomes like your

everything we need inside of it

You should go outside of it Shmuli
when you’re older Then you’ll know
if you want to stay inside

business

KIRSCHBAUM (0S)

Dovid turns YOSEF KIRSCHBAUM (60s) and DR GIDEON RIGLER
(50s) come up to him and shake hands

DOVID
Good morning Yosef Dr Rigler

DR RIGLER
Good morning

KIRSCHBAUM
How are you Dovid

Dovid nods smiling
KIRSCHBAUM (CONTD)

How is your speech coming along
It will be a wonderful Hesped

DR RIGLER
The Rav would be very proud of you
Dovid

DOVID

It will be hard to do justice to
his life and work

KIRSCHBAUM
Ronit Krushka is staying with you

DOVID
Yes she is

Kirschbaum and Dr Rigler nod unsure Dovid smiles and he
starts walking again more tense

39 INT SYNAGOGUE LIBRARY DAY 39
Dovid leads a study group with GAVRIEL LEVI and AKIVA three

rabbinical newly married students all in their 20s They
have open books before them

GAVRIEL
“Ud-she’ha’melech bim’siboy nir’di
nosson reichoy”

DOVID
OK stop there So what does it
mean Give us the translation - in
English

GAVRIEL
“While the king is at his table my
perfume sends forth its fragrance”

DOVID
Yes - “A bundle of myrrh is my
beloved to me that lies all night
between my breasts My beloved is
to me as a cluster of henna blooms
in the vineyards of Ein-Gedi”

Dovid stops sits back and motions to the others to comment

DOVID (CONTD)
Nu

LEVI
Rashi makes the point

DOVID
No - let’s not think about Rashi’s
commentaries for a moment What do
YOU think

The students look at him a touch shocked

GAVRIEL
Is it that is it about Hashem and
Israel

AKIVA

Or is it about sensuality That
is the way in which true love
manifests itself

DOVID
But might it also mean that between
a male and a female there is
something higher than that

LEVI
No The references to sensual
pleasures celebrate physical love
here

(MORE )
LEVI (CONTD)
The enjoyment of that love becomes
in this context the highest

GAVRIEL
Perhaps but that is a limited
view There are many different
forms of love

DOVID
“See you are fair my love you
are fair your eyes are doves”

30A

Dovid suddenly looks very tired He takes off his glasses and
closes his eyes Pinches the bridge of his nose

DOVID (CONTD)
“See you are handsome my beloved
yea pleasing and our bed is
verdant The beams of our house are
cedar and our rafters”

Dovid stops
DOVID (CONTD)
(puts on his glasses)

Continue to read the commentaries
to yourselves

one

RONIT
So you were alright After I
left

ESTI

No I was ill
48A

RONIT
What sort of ill
Esti shrugs

ESTI
In my head
The Rav was afraid for me and if I
was going to have to sleep with a
man why not with our best friend

RONIT
Esti

ESTI
I think he felt marriage would
“cure” me And it hasn’t been a
disaster

RONIT

And that’s Enough Do you have to
have sex every Friday

ESTI
It’s expected

RONIT
It’s medieval

ESTI

wheelie bag Ronit follows her Esti stands against a brick
wall

movie Ronit and Esti break away from each other to see why
the light is happening

Standing fifteen yards away staring at them -- a couple
Hinda and her husband LEV (40s) Hinda wears a long skirt
and holds a tennis racquet Lev holds a racquet too

how much the couple saw Esti turns and disappears down a
path and past a building

walking towards Ronit who stands there not knowing what to
do

RONIT
I’m just seeing the old places

HINDA
This is my husband Lev This is
Ronit the Rav’s daughter Remember
I told you all about her

Lev stares at Ronit sternly Ronit shields her eyes from the
bright light

RONIT
Hi Lev How’s it going

Lev is obviously resentful of her presence

LEV
I hear that you’re attending the
Hesped The Rav was a truly great
man

Lev’s coldness infuriates Ronit
RONIT

you like a cigarette

They both shake their heads

leaves lighting up a cigarette as she goes She even manages
to look good trailing the wheelie bag New Yorkish

Rav know the answer to that

You want to protect the woman who
is shaming you and your wife

felt And I feel none We will
welcome Ronit with grace She is in

or truthful as the true feeling
of Being free

He hesitates he looks up at the women’s section and sees --
Esti is looking at him with deep love

And seeing her triggers something in him He looks at Esti
and Ronit with love beyond blame

He knows what he must do

The Rav was a giant of Torah But
it wasn’t a giant that we saw
collapse that day but a man

His words start raising some eyebrows but he speaks with
captivating honesty

He talked of the angels and the
desires of the beasts With his
last breath the Rav reminded us of
this we are free to choose
