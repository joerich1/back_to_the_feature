FADE IN

EXTERIOR - GRASSLAND - GRAND HUNT - DAY

Across the field echoes the tumult - a mixture of the sounds
of the gongs drums and conch horns of the beaters and the
barking of dogs

A mass of mounted Samurai dressed for hunting are galloping
through the tall summer grass which waves wildly as they
storm by They are wearing rush hats deerskin hunting wear
and leather arm protectors and are carrying quivers on their
backs

The Samurai in the lead old but tough draws his bow aiming
at the prey His long white hair and beard billow in the
wind his hawkish eyes shine in his tanned face - the
magnificent vision of a great warrior who has survived
hundreds of battles This is the Great Lord Hidetora
Ichimonji

EXTERIOR - PLATEAU - DAY

A three-forked road - two forks split to right and left
toward the mountains on the edge of the plateau the other to
the great expanse of the plain below By the three roads are
three camps each with a different family crest indicating
the owner on the bunting Stationed by the respective camps
are retainers and beaters The horses graze their bodies
gleaming with sweat

EXTERIOR - ICHIMONJI CAMP - DAY

The family crest of Ichimonji a figure meaning “one” is on
the bunting

EXTERIOR - INCHIMONJI CAMP - DAY

A circle of lords and retainers seated comfortably around
saké and food enjoying the feast In the center Hidetora
Ichimonji On his left accompanied by their respective
retainers are the lords Fujimaki and Ayabe On his right are
Taro Takatora who is Hidetora’s first son and heir Jiro
Masatora his second son and Saburo Naotora his third son
Facing Hidetora are his chief retainers Tango and Ikoma
AYABE
First a drink of congratulations
to Lord Ichimonji who performed
the feat of the day at the grand
hunt when his arrow killed the
great boar

FUJIMAKTI
All at once it was in front of me
My horse gave a leap and I lost my
chance to grab an arrow I was
dismounted

TARO
Father shall we cook the boar
here

HIDETORA
That was an old boar Its meat it
tough it stinks - hardly edible
Would you like to eat old Hidetora
(Glares at Fujimaki and
Ayabe)

FUJIMAKI
No one would if he could no
matter what Therefore I
accompanied you today on the hunt
in order to deepen our friendship

AYABE
That is correct And I too would
like to strengthen the bond between
the houses of Ichimonji and Ayabe
through the marriage of my daughter
to your son Saburo

FUJIMAKI
Wait I have the same desire Lord
Ichimonji today is a good
opportunity Please give us your
answer Whom will you choose for
Lord Saburo’s bride my daughter or
Lord Ayabe’s

HIDETORA
It is a difficult choice two
daughters for one lord If only my
second son Jiro were not already
married

Fujimaki and Ayabe their hostility to each other obvious
silently drink

Hidetora breaks the silence calling a servant-entertainer
the equivalent of the fool in a medieval European court

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Kyoami serve us some
entertainment

A man called Kyoami with a shaved head and wearing strange
clothes who had been waiting at the far end steps up makes
a quick bow and begins to dance as he sings

KYOAMI

(Sings)
What is that
That has come
Hopping over here
From yonder mountain
Pricking up one-
Two long ears
-A hare

His imitation of a hare is amusing enough to win unanimous
applause and laughter from the entire party except for
Saburo who is seated next to Jiro and who does not even
smile

SABURO
I say Kyoami You said a hare But
you meant two

KYOAMI
What

SABURO
Two eh
(Regards Fujimaki and
Ayabe)
Then came hopping over from beyond
those two mountains to be eaten by
my father

TARO
Saburo watch your tongue

JIRO
Do not say such idiotic things

Taro and Jiro glance up at their father Hidetora for his
reaction Hidetora is bent over the cup in his hand A
careful look reveals that he has fallen asleep The cup
falls The entire party shocked stares at Hidetora
FUJIMAKI
The Great Lord looks tired
(Regards Ayabe)
We too should withdraw and wait
until he awakes

Ayabe rises as he glowers at Saburo then sweeps the bunting
aside and goes out

Fujimaki stares at Saburo who has assumed a posture of
composure then quietly raises the bunting and exits

Taro and Jiro follow them out

TARO
(Quietly)
It is a feigned sleep After
Saburo’s insults the only way he
could save the situation was to
pretend to have fallen asleep

Tango and Ikoma exchange worried glances then regard the old
lord Hidetora is quiet sound asleep

Seeing his father sleeping in the midsummer sun Saburo
breaks off a branch of early bush clover to provide shade for
him

EXTERIOR - SKY - COLUMNS OF CLOUDS - DAY

The clouds climb up magnificently into the blue sky one side
shining brilliantly in the afternoon sun

EXTERIOR - ICHIMONJI CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

Taro Jiro and Ikoma greet Tango who has been looking into
the are surrounded with bunting where Hidetora is sleeping

TARO
Is he still asleep

TANGO
Yes snug and sound

JIRO
It has never happened before He
was merely hunting He never looked
tired before even after he had
captured a domain
TARO
The sun is in the west Wake him
up We have the lords Fujimaki and
Ayabe as our guests

Saburo who had been sleeping in the grass abruptly awakes
and yawns

SABURO
It you are going to worry about
something worry about father He
is not snoring loudly today That
is strange

He looks over at the bunting Taro Jiro Tango and Ikoma
follow his glance

The bunting begins to sway Sweeping it open Hidetora
staggers out almost expressionless vacantly gazing into
space His bearing gradually reveals the emaciation of old
age - the vigor he showed at the hunt has vanished there is
not even the least trace of it he is like a different man

Taro and the others look at each other then run to him

TARO
Father what is the matter with
you
JIRO
Are you ill
HIDETORA
Be quiet
(Pause)
I had a dream a dream of a
wilderness A wilderness no

matter how far I went I saw no one
I shouted and screamed but no one

answered And then this cool summer
breeze cut into me like a blast of

autumn wind - and I woke up

Everyone is listening silently amazed at the seriousness in
his tone

HIDETORA (CONTD)
When I awoke I was alone
Alone all by myself The thought
almost suffocated me I felt a
shudder run through me I jumped to
my feet and left the place
Ridiculous Taro’s voice brought me
back to myself

(MORE)
HIDETORA (CONTD)
There in front of my eyes were my
dear children Taro Jiro and
Saburo

He looks tenderly at his three sons

SABURO
Father this is the first time that
I see you like this

TARO
Saburo hold your tongue Are you
not grateful for the way he feels
about us He trusts us

SABURO
But I cannot believe what he has
just said because we are not
allowed to do anything except on
orders from our father Do you
think we are trusted the way things
are

HIDETORA
All right I have been thinking of
this for a long time I shall tell
you my decision The place is
right The time is right The lords
Fujimaki and Ayabe who wish to
marry their daughters to Saburo
are here with us Someone escort
the two lords here

EXTERIOR - SKY - RAINHEADS - SUNSET

The tops of the clouds have turned dark In the distance
there are signs of a storm - the rumble of distant thunder

EXTERIOR - PLATEAU - SUNSET

The vast plain below is illuminated by the slanting rays of
the setting sun throwing up silhouettes of the large
medium and small castles Hidetora sits on a camp stool
against that background He begins to speak to the men around
him Taro Jiro Saburo Fujimaki Ayabe Tango Ikoma and
the other main retainers There is almost nothing in his
appearance of the earlier emaciation and there is a tone of
confidence in his voice
HIDETORA

I Hidetora Ichimonji
(Points to the small
castle in the distance)
was born in that small castle
At that time this plain of Unno was
the scene of fighting a struggle
among countless lords When I was
seventeen I raised my flag over
that castle I fought hard for
fifty-odd years and at last I
conquered this plain and raised the
Ichimonji standard over that castle
there

(Points to the massive

castle on one side of the

plain)
And after that I have spent the
years crossing swords and spears
with these two lords The time has
come when we are finally able to
put the steeds of war to rest But
I am already seventy

He sighs and drops his shoulders but then suddenly
straightens up and looks sharply around the group

HIDETORA (CONTD)
I Hidetora hereby hand the
headship of the house to my eldest
song Taro

The retainers who had been listening intently show surprise
and consternation Tango and Ikoma exchange glances The
former moves forward on his knees gazing at Hidetora

TANGO
My lord we do not understand It
is so sudden

HIDETORA
No It is something I have long
thought about someday the time
will come when I retire and let the
young men take care of my domains
Listen men Now is the time Let
me restate it to all of you From
now on Taro is the head of the
House of Ichimonji the lord of the
land I will move from the castle
keep to the outworks

(MORE)
HIDETORA (CONTD)
I will keep thirty retainers by my
side as well as the title and forms
of lordship but administration of
the land and sovereignty over the
steeds of war will all go to Taro
Obey well my orders all of you

All the retainers are dumbfounded The faces of Tango Ikoma
and the other chief vassals express misgivings over
Hidetora’s proclamation Fujimaki and Ayabe also cannot help
looking at each other

JIRO
(Dissatisfied)
I will obey But would you kindly
give Saburo and me your
instructions for our future

Hidetora looks at Jiro with a fleeting expression as if he
had been caught in a lie

HIDETORA
You Jiro and Saburo are to defend
the Second and Third Castles and
assist Taro who will be in the
First Castle I will be your guest
sometimes at the First Castle
sometimes at the Second and the
Third enjoying my remaining years

SABURO
(Muttering)
Oh pity the old

His words sound crude and heartless but behind the seeming
heartlessness there is love

TARO

(Goes forward speaks

humbly )
I would like to speak Your
honorable command concerning the
inheritance of headship of the
house is most appreciated but I
beg you to reconsider

HIDETORA
Why

TARO
Though I am your eldest son to
rule this land in your place is too
great a task for me

(MORE)
TARO (CONTD)
I have always prayed to the god of
war that my father might live to a
hundred years even if it meant the
shortening of my own life

SABURO
Taro is surely talented at
speeches I could never know how to
use such sweet words It is
embarrassing to listen to him

HIDETORA
You are perverse Are you saying
that Taro is trying to flatter me

Saburo is about to speak

JIRO
(Interrupting)

Father pay no attention to Saburo
I feel the same way as Taro we
long to be safe in our father’s
arms But the time has come for us
in order to make your remaining
years peaceful to stand in the
thick of the world’s arrows

HIDETORA
Well said Jiro Bring me that
quiver

He takes three arrows from the quiver and hands one each to
Taro Jiro and Saburo

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Can you break these

The three brothers accept the arrows with a dubious look
then break the arrows with a snap

The father watches them then hands them three arrows more

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Now bundle these and try to break
them

None of the three can break them Hidetora watches them

HIDETORA (CONTD)
A single arrow can easily be
broken But three arrows in a

bundle cannot
(MORE)

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Even if mishap befalls Taro and he
cannot defend himself alone if you
put your strength together both
the House of Ichimonji and this
land will stay secure

Saburo places the three arrows against his knee and shatters
them

HIDETORA (CONTD)
(White with rage)
You perverse brat Are you still
pulling your tricks on me

SABURO
You are the one who is acting
foolishly speaking such nonsense

HIDETORA
What do you mean nonsense

SABURO
You are Either you are senile or
you are mad

HIDETORA
Silence How dare you speak like
that to you father What have I
said that is mad What have I said
that is senile nonsense

SABURO

I will tell you First just what
do you think this world is This is
a world where men’s evil cruel
instincts are exposed where you
cannot live unless you throw aside
your humanity and all noble
feelings

HIDETORA
I am well aware of that

SABURO
I suppose you are You have spilled
so much human blood you cannot
measure it You have lived without
mercy or pity But Father we too
are children of this degraded age
of strife you do not know what we
may be thinking - “my dear
children” you think To me
Father you are none other than a
madman - a senile old madman

HIDETORA
(Choked threateningly)
All right Then you are saying that
someday according to the
circumstances you may regard me as
no longer your parent and might
betray me

SABURO
You are being foolish again No
betrayer ever tells you he is going
to betray you

HIDETORA
Then you are saying that Taro and
Jiro have treason in their minds

JIRO
Maybe he does not want you Taro
to inherit the lordship

TARO
Saburo are you trying to slander
me for that purpose Even if you
are my brother if you go too far
I must punish you

SABURO
Father your warning about the
three arrows seems to have been
wasted already At this rate it
will not be long before we are
fighting each other washing blood
with blood

HIDETORA
What is this It is outrageous Do
you intend to disregard your
father’s will and wishes All
right If you insist that there are
no parents or children in today’s
world then just as you wish I
cut the bond of parent and child
between us From now on you are a
complete stranger to me Out of my
sight Be gone

TANGO
What are you saying my lord

HIDETORA
Quiet Tango It was my mistake to
have loved Saburo more than anyone
else and so I spoiled him

(MORE)

HIDETORA (CONTD)
I am the one who raised him as
arrogant and impudent It is too
late for regrets Rotten flesh has
to be cut off even if it is your
own

TANGO
Please wait What Master Saburo
said was blunt and could even be
thought rude but those were just
the frank words that came from an
honest character If you listen
carefully he is telling the truth
and is not in error

HIDETORA
Silence
(Flashes his sword)

TANGO
Are you mad my lord As your
aides it is our duty to tell you
what we think I Tango shall not
withdraw one step just because you
wave your sword at me now Please
withdraw your exceedingly rash
decision at once

HIDETORA
I told you to be silent

TANGO
I will not

HIDETORA
You are rude Your impudence
matches Saburo’s I can permit it
no longer Both of you be gone

Fujimaki Ayabe and the retainers gaze in astonishment
speechless at the argument between father and son lord and
vassal

EXTERIOR - SKY - THUNDERHEADS - SUNSET

About to dissolve into rain the clouds trail over the
setting sun The sun is an ominous red

EXTERIOR - PLATEAU - SUNSET

Saburo is lying down the pampas grass for his bedding and
his arm for a pillow Tango is crouching beside him Two
horses are grazing

SABURO
(Mumbles disconnectedly)
What troubles

TANGO
Well what are you going to do
Master Saburo

SABURO
Not me The one in trouble is my
father It pains me to think where
he is heading for Tango you are a
fool

TANGO
Why am I a fool

SABURO
For defending me and being thrown
out with me It was a mistake for
you to leave my father’s side no
matter what

Over track we hear dashing hoofbeats Saburo and Tango are
listening

TANGO
I cannot believe it They seem to
have sent someone after us

The two of them jump onto their horses and race away at full
gallop Five horsemen chase them

Chased Saburo and Tango reach the top of a cliff
reluctantly stop their horses and turn around their hands
on the hilts of their swords

The chasers are Fujimaki and his retainers

FUJIMAKI
Why do you run away my son-in-law

SABURO
(Reacts stares at him)
Son-in-law Me

FUJIMAKI

(Dismounts )
I am a hasty man Please listen to
me Lord Saburo you have become
the object of your father’s rage
and have been exiled from your
land Lord Ayabe and I have seen
and heard what happened form the
start To you young lord who are
now an exile and no different from
a beggar no excuse my rudeness
What I mean to say is that well
I cannot put it very well

(Frustrated)

SABURO
(Laughs dismounts )
It does not matter To me no
different from a beggar

FUJIMAKI
I thought that to you as you are
I would not give my daughter in
marriage

SABURO
I should suppose not

FUJIMAKI
Wait a minute That is what Lord
Ayabe thought too and he decided
against the marriage I too had
withdrawn my proposal But as I was
returning to my land I kept on
thinking how wonderfully you had
acted I liked you more and more
How could I let such a young lord
go I will take him for my son-in-
law I thought and turned back In
the meantime you had run away
Would you dislike to become my son-

in-law

SABURO
Whether I would dislike it or
not

FUJIMAKI

Well first come to my land and
think it over seriously Tango
you too are splendid You are a
man of will I need you too Will
you come with us

TANGO

I am truly grateful for your
kindness but I cannot

(Bows to Fujimaki turns

to Saburo)
No matter what guises I may have to
assume I will never leave the
Great Lord

(Whips horse gallops

away )

EXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN SKYLINE - NIGHT

The moon comes out

EXTERIOR - PAMPAS GRASS FIELD - NIGHT

Pampas leaves glimmer in moonlight The moon is golden and
so are the pampas leaves On the field the silhouettes of
Hidetora’s ranks returning to his castle from the grand hunt
Hidetora rides swaying his head dropped he is drowsy Taro
and Jiro watching Hidetora on his horse from behind are
talking in low voices carefully looking around

TARO
What do you think of Father today

JIRO
I cannot say it out loud but he
was not normal

TARO
I suppose old age is getting the
better of him

JIRO
He has never been able to see
himself objectively Growing old
has made his temper even worse and
he cannot distinguish things
anymore

TARO
He has always been able to do just
what he wanted and so he has
become rigid in his selfishness
Yet his capriciousness is really
too much for me

JIRO

(Grins )
Thanks to his capriciousness this
land has fallen into your hands
Above all it is essential for us
to contrive a way to prevent his
capriciousness from taking the land
back again

TARO
Hmm help me then

Hidetora who seemed to be asleep suddenly squares his broad
shoulders looks straight ahead and gives a command in a
loud voice

HIDETORA
Men light the torches

TARO
Father we do not need torches in
this moonlight

HIDETORA
Idiot We are going into the
forest On a moonlit night the
forest is even darker

Taro says nothing Jiro looks coolly at Taro

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DAY

The massive castle is impressive

INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DAY

Two streams of servants and soldiers carrying numerous
women’s articles pass each other Among them are
chambermaids carrying hand-boxes and tiny cases They stop
Taro’s wife Lady Kaede followed by her maids stops as her
procession comes to a standstill

KAEDE
What is going on

She seems hot-tempered and knits her brows

From the front of the line an old woman comes over with
quick small steps and kneeling explains

OLD WOMAN
Lord Hidetora’s mistresses are
moving from the castle keep to the
outworks and they will not get out
of the way for my lady’s
procession

KAEDE
How rude I am now the lady of this
castle How dare they block my
path

The old woman scurries away

INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - OUTWORKS - DAY

Hidetora is looking out the window

INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - PASSAGE - DAY

Hidetora’s mistresses stand to one side and kneel as they let
Lady Kaede’s procession pass by

INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - OUTWORKS - DAY

HIDETORA
Why are my women kneeling to Taro’s
women It is outrageous

Ikoma who has been waiting on him at his side appears
annoyed

IKOMA
How can you say that Since you
have given possession of the caste
to Lord Taro it is only natural

Hidetora suddenly closes the window Then suddenly we hear
a singing voice

VOICE
(Singing)
He gives away his house
He gives away his fields

Hidetora looks away

From the corner of the room Kyoami comes out singing and
dancing in the same strange costume he previously wore

KYOAMI
(Singing)
Our village chief is good-natured
He will end up a scarecrow in the paddy

HIDETORA
(Turns angrily)
Are you trying to call me a fool

KYOAMI

God forbid The fool is me

(Points to himself)
-ehere to curry your favor you
illustrious laughingstock I ama
fool Buy you my lord

(Points to Hidetora)
-eare another You have lost all
you have gained

He dashes away gesturing like an idiot

18 INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DONJON - TOP FLOOR - DAY
Taro and Lady Kaede his wife

KAEDE
How truly auspicious it is that you
have ascended to the headship of
the House of Ichimonji

TARO
(His whole face smiling)
Kaede
(Stands up looks out
window)

How many times have I looked out
form here on the landscape And
now that it is mine this landscape
looks entirely different

Kaede ignoring Taro’s deep emotion looks at the upper
platform There are no furnishings on it it looks bare

KAEDE
I am sure the standard was
displayed there
TARO
(Nods )
Father’s standard and his armor and
helmet were displayed there

KAEDE
Well where are they

TARO
(Casually)
I just handed them to Father’s
bearers

Kaede tightly knits her brows

KYOAMI
I do not care about the armor but
the standard My lord That
standard is supposed to be with the
head of the Hoes of Ichimonji

Taro’s face reveals a slightly troubled expression
TARO

But Father said that he would keep
the title and forms of lordship

KAEDE
Without the forms you are just a
shadow

TARO

What do you mean Father definitely
said that the headship would go to
me

KAEDE
Then behave like it

She rises and shouts down from the top of the staircase
KAEDE (CONT’D)
Somebody Bring the standard here
Bring the standard back here It is
our lord’s order

VOICE
Yes my lady

The voice is followed by hasty footsteps

Taro stands in blank amazement

Kaede seeing him from the corner of her eye crosses to the
window and gazes out calm and composed

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - PASSAGE - DAY

A group of people packed in the narrow passage between the
castle battlement and the stone wall jostle each other in
unusual excitement Swaying in the waves of men is the large
Ichimonji standard

Hidetora’s and Taro’s retainers are struggling for the red
banner displaying a golden character that means “one”

VOICE 1
What do you think you are doing

VOICE 2
Take it back to the keep

VOICE 3
The Ichimonji standard belongs to
the Great Lord

VOICE 4
It is the head of the house’s
standard and Lord Taro is the head
of the Ichimonji House now

VOICE 5
Do not let them have it Do not let
them have it

VOICE 6
Give it to us

With a great shout they whirl about and struggle furiously
sending up dust The whirl of dust surrounds the golden
character on the banner

Kyoami who has been watching from a nearby tower dances
singing in a loud voice

KYOAMI
(Sings)
That lord is a gourd in the wind
Tottering this way tottering that

One of Taro’s retainers looks up at him and runs up the
tower

KYOAMI (CONTD)
(Continues)
Tottering this way tottering that
(MORE)

KYOAMI (CONTD)
A gourd we will hang from the keep
Wouldn’t that be amusing

Reaching the top of the tower Taro’s retainer grabs Kyoami
by the collar

RETAINER
You insolent bastard I will give
you this

He tries to push Kyoami off the tower

At that moment an arrow its feathers whistling flies into
the retainer’s chest He groans and falls down the stone
wall Shocked Kyoami falls back and lands on his buttocks
Hidetora’s retainers and Taro’s are startled for an instant
then look around to see where the arrow came from

INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - OUTWORKS - DAY

Hidetora standing on the upper story his foot on the
windowsill one of his sleeves rolled up holding a bow in
his other hand He has the fierce bearing of a ferocious
warrior

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - PASSAGE - DAY

Taro’s retainers frightened run away Behind them remains
the corpse fallen from the tower its neck broken

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - OUTWORKS - SQUARE - NIGHT

The Ichimonji standard hangs at the entrance to the castle
outworks In the square beneath the stone steps bonfires are
quickly lighted Hidetora and his attendants and retainers
are holding a banquet The retainers are singing in chorus
with Kyoami who dances as he sings

RETAINERS
(Singing)
That lord is a gourd in the wind

Hidetora is drinking watching them sing Suddenly we hear a
loud voice

VOICE
Who is there

Kyoami shrinks behind Hidetora

Taro’s attendant Ogura is being questioned by a guard

OGURA
I am a messenger from the keep
GUARD
Pass
22A ANOTHER ANGLE

Ogura goes into the square and kneels before Hidetora

OGURA
I beg to speak Lord Taro Takatora
is holding a family gathering to
drink in celebration of the
transference of the headship of the
house Therefore he requests the
presence of his father

HIDETORA
Humph It seems he is summoning me

Hidetora angrily gets to his feet

OGURA
Lord Ikoma you are invited too

23 EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DONJON - NIGHT

The donjon seems to float above the bonfires Lights flicker
in the windows

24 INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DONJON - TOP FLOOR - NIGHT

Taro and Kaede are sitting side by side illuminated by
candlelight their backs to the alcove That means they are
superior to any other in the room Before them are saké and
dishes of food and at a distance a round straw mat which
is a lower seat

Hidetora rises from the stairs and looks around
HIDETORA
I heard this was a family

celebration But is it just us

TARO
Yes

Ikoma and Ogura come up and sit side by side behind Hidetora

KAEDE
Please have a seat

HIDETORA
Am I to take the lower seat Who do
you think I am

KAEDE
You are my husband’s honorable
father

HIDETORA

Is that all What happened to the
Great Lord Is he dead

TARO
Please do not joke

HIDETORA
I am not joking As I remember I
said I would keep the title and
forms of the Great Lord You must
not forget it

TARO
We have not forgotten it It is
you Father who have forgotten
that you gave the headship of the
house to me

HIDETORA
What do you mean I handed you this
castle keep moved down to the
outworks and even set a limit on
the number of my retainers

TARO
They may be few in number but
their actions are intolerable What
does that song mean

The comic song is heard again sung by Hidetora’s drunken
retainers

VOICES
(Singing)
The gourd in the wind
Tottering this way tottering that
Let us hang this gourd
From the castle keep
Wouldn’t that be amusing

Then a burst of jeering voices

TARO
Father with this going on how can
I exercise authority over my men

HIDETORA
They are rough warriors They do
not understand etiquette and
politeness Sometimes they sing
comic songs

TARO
Even with comic songs there are
limits It was not unreasonable
that one of my retainers rebuked
the idiot whose song was clearly
making fun of me But of all
things you shot that retainer of
mine That I cannot overlook No I
can close my eyes to what happened
today but I want you to pledge
firmly that such a thing will never
happen again

He looks at Kaede She takes the thick ceremonial paper that
has been placed on the wooden stand table beneath the scroll
of Hachiman the god of war in the alcove and hands it to
Hidetora

TARO (CONTD)
I would like you to sign this and
seal it with your blood

Hidetora roughly opens the ceremonial paper When he has
glanced over it he turns to glare full of menace at Taro
then throws it in from of Ikoma

HIDETORA
This is so absurd that I do not
know what to say Read it

Ikoma picks up the paper and reads it

IKOMA
(Reading)
A PLEDGE IN WRITING

Clause 1 I transfer to Taro
Takatora the headship of the House
of Ichimonji
Clause 2 Therefore Taro Takatora
is now the head of the House of
Ichimonji

(MORE)

IKOMA (CONTD)
Clause 3 Hereafter I though the
father of Taro Takatora shall
submit myself to his authority and
shall not act contrary to it I
shall not be guilty of deceit with
respect to any of the above
clauses I pledge the above upon
any and every god on this land

HIDETORA
Well do you think I can affix my
signature to such a stupid document
and seal it in blood

IKOMA
You were the one who originally
suggested this in the presence of
the lords Fujimaki and Ayabe Why
does this document bother you now

Ogura immediately puts before Hidetora an inkstone and a
brush It seems that all has been meticulously planned and
prepared in advance

Hidetora is instantly cornered After a moment’s hesitation
he indignantly signs the pledge and seals it with his blood
He throws the paper at Taro

HIDETORA
Are you my son

TARO
What are you saying

HIDETORA
Is this a childs attitude toward
his parent
(Glares at Kaede who is
silent and expressionless)
The hen makes the rooster cry

He springs to his feet kicking over the bottles of saké and
food that have been prepared

HIDETORA (CONTD)
I will not stay in this castle I
have another son

He runs down the stairs stamping loudly Ikoma rises to
follow him

KAEDE
(To Ikoma)
Well done Thank you
25-26

Ikoma bows and exits Taro watches him go His pale face
exudes a sense of guilt a feeling that has yet to be
stilled

KAEDE (CONTD)
(Still seated)
How I have longed for this day

Taro looks at his wife surprised

KAEDE (CONTD)
I was born and bred in this castle
which used to belong to my father
Then I left it to marry you My
father and brothers all unaware
because of our marriage were
murdered by your father Hidetora
Then I was brought back to this
castle which was seized from my
family I have waited for this
day ever since

Taro looks at Kaede horrified She is quiet for a while
then slowly looks around the room

KAEDE (CONTD)
This is the room where my mother
committed suicide
Her glance frozen her eyes shining strangely she is quite
still Madness rises from her beautiful immobility Taro
stares at her

FADE IN
EXTERIOR - VIEW OF SECOND CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON
Although the Second Castle is smaller in scale than the

First its black structure gives a feeling of warlike
ferocity

INTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - DONJON - ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Thick pillars and crossbeams run vertically and horizontally
crisscrossing making the interior dim though outside it is

still daytime The weapons lined against the wooden wall give
a sense of warlike brutality

Surrounding Jiro who is reading a letter are his three
confidants Kurogane Shirane and Naganuma

JIRO
My father is on his way here He
was politely thrown out of the
First Castle

The three confidants exchange glances

JIRO (CONTD)
My brother’s letter says that it is
dangerous to let our selfish father
in the castle That is not all It
also says that Ikoma his aide
understands my brother’s intentions

He hands the letter to Kurogane who peruses it

KUROGANE
Hmm Lord Taro’s unusual severity
is almost unbelievable By the way
my lord why are you sitting there
quietly doing nothing

NAGANUMA
Exactly You are the one who should
be following in the footsteps of
the Great Lord and assuming the
burden of ruling this land Lord
Taro does not have that ability

SHIRANE
If I were you I should stake my
whole life on this chance

Kurogane and Naganuma nod slowly A faint smile comes to
Jiro’s lips as he watches the three His face in uncannily
gentle like a woman’s

JIRO
Then all of you are willing to
stake your lives with mine

SHIRANE
Just as you say

NAGANUMA
The hunting dogs will not follow
their master if he lets the game

go
KUROGANE
If you are not fleet then you are
our game
JIRO

How the dogs howl

Lord and vassals exchange words without restraint as though
equals in their manner can be felt the bonds that tightly
link them

JIRO (CONTD)
It has always bothered me as well
Why should I have to spend my life
groveling at my elder brother’s
feet just because I was born twelve
months later I will kick off these
shackles

SHIRANE
Right my lord Splendid

JIRO
Save your breath Listen carefully
My brother is no problem But his
wife Lady Kaede is

KUROGANE
That is true She should be perfect
for you Why not steal her from
him

JIRO
Do not be so direct But before
that there is also my father He
may have retired but he took
thirty retainers with him - every
one of them a brave warrior a
match for a thousand He will soon
come here with those brave
warriors What shall we do

The three aides shout almost unanimously

KUROGANE
It is not wise to let him in

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - GATE - LATE AFTERNOON

Hidetora rides onto the huge gate Ikoma and the other
retainers as well as concubines and women attendants
following

HIDETORA
It is Hidetora Let us pass

His loud voice is overwhelming not belying his magnificent
look A guard peeks out a loophole then hastily retracts his
head The castle gate opens

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - SQUARE - LATE AFTERNOON

On the outside is a small gate on the inside a large one
The large gate is called the front gate and the small gate
facing the outside is called the castle gate Though smaller
than the front gate the castle gate is not really small

The guards prostrate themselves Hidetora rides in Ikoma is
beside him followed by his retainers and servants all dirty
with dust and sweat as well as his fatigued concubines and
attendants Their state of exhaustion tells of their
miserable travel across the field in the blazing summer sun

The great doors of the front gate open for Hidetora He rides
in passing by the kneeling guards

HIDETORA
(To chief guard)
The women are tired Let them rest
in the shade and give them water
(Pause)
I will see Sué first
(Pause)
Tell Jiro that I will see him later
(Turns to passage)

INTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - PRAYER HALL - SUNSET

A tiny cottage standing in solitude within the grandiose
castle grounds Hidetora comes and calls inside the cottage

HIDETORA
Sué Sué

There is no answer Hidetora opens the door to the cottage
There is no one inside One the little altar a portrait of
the Amitabha Inside the dim room it is a shining golden
figure

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - HIGH STONE WALL - SUNSET

A stone wall soaring in the lingering light describing an
arc like the gradient of a Japanese fan Above it the figure
of a woman standing in a long robe of wadded silk and
kneeling behind her the tiny figures of an old woman and a
chambermaid

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTE - TOP OF STONE WALL - SUNSET

Lady Sué her hands together holding a rosary is praying to
the western sky where the setting sun is giving off its last
shafts of light

SUE
Hail the Western Paradise to the
Amitabha in thirty-six trillion
identical manifestations

HIDETORA
Oh just as I thought you are here
(Approaches )

The old woman and the chambermaid seeing Hidetora prostrate
themselves as though frightened

SUE
(Regards Hidetora)
Father-in-law

She is about to prostrate herself but Hidetora takes her
hand

HIDETORA
No ceremony It has been a long
time Let me see your face
(Looks at her tenderly as
if at his own child)
You always have a sad face Every
time I see you it pains me

She tries to smile

HIDETORA (CONTD)
That is even more heartbreaking

He turns his eyes away but then looks sharply at her firmly
takes her by the shoulders and shakes her

HIDETORA (CONTD)
It was I Hidetora who burned your
castle with your father and mother
and your family in it

(MORE )

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Why do you look at me like that
Rather glare at me with hatred It
would make me feel easier

But she continues gazing gently at Hidetora He lets his
hands drop weakly from her shoulders

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Circumstances forced me to burn
that castle If your father had
just opened the castle to me and
had lowered his head to me I would
not have burned it and your father
and mother would not have died
No there is no use in talking
about it now Go on hate me

SUE
I do not hate you Everything has
been preordained in our previous
lives All things are the heart
of the Buddha

HIDETORA
The Buddha again There are no
Buddhas in today’s wold This is a
degraded age when the Buddha’s
guardians Bonten and Taishaku
have been routed by raging Asuras
It is not a world where we can rely
on the Buddha’s compassion

Sué looks up sadly at Hidetora He looks down on her with
pity

Jiro and Naganuma come running up the stone steps

HIDETORA (CONTD)

(Seeing them)
Is that you Jiro Son I am going
to be a guest in your castle
Jiro I am disappointed in Taro
I can no longer consider him my
child You too are not to think
of him as your brother Listen to
what happened

JIRO
(Interrupting)
Father I already know what
happened from my brother’s letter

HIDETORA
You received a letter from Taro

JIRO
According to his letter your
retainers were rough and wild
beyond toleration He wrote that I
should greet you with a son’s
proper courtesy but not to let
your retainers into my castle

HIDETORA
What You think I am going to come
into the castle all alone leaving
my followers to rot outside

JIRO
Lord Taro is the head of the House
of Ichimonji and I have no choice
but to obey his instructions

Hidetora is shocked speechless his body shaking with
violent rage

JIRO (CONTD)
If you think that is unreasonable
it might be best for you to go
apologize to my elder brother and
go back to the First Castle

HIDETORA
Apologize to Taro and go back to
the First Castle

He forgets his dignity and lets out a sorrowful cry

Sué stands there watching the two of them with tears in her
eyes Is it the golden western sky illuminating her figure
that gives her the very appearance of a weeping Buddha

Then we hear a burst of unusual sounds and shouts

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - FRONT GATE - SUNSET

The garrison are driving Hidetora’s retainers out of the
gate levelling their spears

RETAINERS
What are you doing You did not
give us water and now you do this
to us Outrageous If the Great
Lord hears about this you will be
severely punished

Outside the gate is a group of concubines and women trembling
in fear gazing at the unbelievable happening

Kyoami is sitting alone apart from the women a hand on his
cheek observing calmly

Standing behind the retainers Ikoma shouts

IKOMA
Lord Kurogane Lord Shirane Just
what is this treatment

Kurogane and Shirane ignore him sneering standing behind
the garrison

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - PASSAGE - SUNSET

Hidetora Jiro and Naganuma come running

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - FRONT GATE - SUNSET

The garrison push Hidetora’s retainers brutally out of the
gate and close the doors But the doors begins to open again
banged and pushed hard by the retainers outside The guards
push them back and bar the doors Kurogane steps forward and
calls out

KUROGANE
Lord Ikoma Lord Ikoma An order
from the Great Lord

Hidetora who has come running with Jiro and Naganuma stops
to listen

KUROGANE (CONTD)
“Today we have come so suddenly
that the castle has to make
preparation for us Wait quietly
outside until is it ready” These
are the Great Lord’s instructions

Hidetora looks sharply at Jiro Jiro prepares for his
father’s furious reproach But contrary to his anticipation
Hidetora is calmly gazing at Jiro with profound sadness in
his eyes Jiro looks down to avoid his gaze

HIDETORA
This is enough I understand
(Calmly as if groaning)
You are not in the least different
from Taro You too want to get
rid of me

JIRO
Not at all I would have been
delighted to welcome you if you had
come alone

HIDETORA
Humph You know that I could not do
that

JIRO

Father if you are retired and
intend to depend on your sons
there should be no need for
retainers

HIDETORA
Only the birds and the beasts can
live by themselves No more
excuses

He straightens himself and shouts

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Open the gate

The soldiers are immobile gazing aghast at the old lord
Hidetora gives a sharp surveying look over them

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Why do you hesitate I said to open
the gate not for my retainers to
enter but for me to exit Open the
gate

Overwhelmed by his strong voice the soldiers hurriedly open
the gate Hidetora strides through the gate stops and looks
back fiercely at Jiro

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Close the doors I shall not see
you again

Jiro is immobile scared Kurogane urges the guards to close
the doors

EXTERIOR - SECOND CASTLE - OUTSIDE FRONT GATE - SUNSET

Hidetora stands in front of the closed front gate his body
full of fury and strength like an angry god of war He looks
around his retainers and women are worriedly gazing at him
Suddenly he bursts into a hysterical laugh then as if
enervated he staggers Kyoami hurriedly runs up to hold him

EXTERIOR - FIELD - DAY

A hot calm summer day There seems to be no living thing in
the field in the sun The Ichimonji standard hangs loosely
without a breeze

Hidetora’s concubines are lying in the shade of a few trees
covering their faces with the sleeves of their beautiful
garments The retainers are sleeping like logs half naked

Hidetora still in possession of the air of a great lord is
seated on a stool gazing into space face contorted
painfully Ikoma seated behind him looks up at him
searchingly

Some retainers gallop in They dismount and kowtow to
Hidetora

FIRST RETAINER
There is no one in the village

SECOND RETAINER
Except for this deserted old man

One of the retainers pulls down a gaunt old farmer who has
been clinging to the horse The old man collapses to the
ground timidly looking at Hidetora trembling in fear

THIRD RETAINER
No rice bales in the granaries not
a grain of rice in the houses

SECOND RETAINER
The farmers must have fled to the
mountains with the rice to avoid
us

Hidetora seems to be listening to their report but is
obviously preoccupied with other thoughts He nods absently
not realizing what is happening The retainers withdraw
disappointed dragging the old man away

IKOMA
My lord we have no other way
than to go to the Third Castle It
was there you first raised your
flag Go there and once again

HIDETORA
(Stares at Ikoma
interrupting)
Idiot
(MORE)
39-51

HIDETORA (CONTD)
If I could do that I would not
have stayed hungry and tired like
this wandering aimlessly like a
beast Just think Will the Third
Castle garrison welcome the one who
banished their master

Ikoma does not answer Kyoami crouching beside Hidetora
regards Ikoma and shrugs his shoulders Hidetora returns his
gaze into space

EXTERIOR - VIEW OF THIRD CASTLE - DAY

This is a mountain caste It rises resolutely in front of a
rigid mountain at the top of a steep slope It is even
smaller than the Second Castle but the marks of recent
repair and enlargement are still new With white tiers added
onto the old wooden frame the castle looks like the awe-
inspiring figure of a young Samurai wearing white armor

EXTERIOR - THIRD CASTLE - FRONT GATE - DAY

Ogura stately in noble headgear and courtly robes comes
riding up leading Taro’s retainers and shouts into the
castle

OGURA
By the order of Lord Taro Takatora
head of the House of Ichimonji I
Ogura have come to take possession
of this castle Open the gate

A dead silence within the castle

OGURA (CONT’D)
Although we fully understand the
wholehearted devotion of the
garrison whose master Saburo
Naotora has become an exile open
the gate and let us in in peace
Then you will be accepted as Lord
Taro’s retainers with your present
positions and allowances

There is no answer from inside the castle

OGURA (CONT’D)
Open the gate Open the gate

The great doors slowly open to the left and right revealing
a crowd of Samurai in the castle square either on horseback
or on foot in their armor and helmets spears and bows in
hand

Ogura and Taro’s retainers gasp in surprise then hurriedly
prepare for combat But the soldiers inside the castle merely
form ranks

The mounted men in front spur their horses to a trot and come
out quietly The bearded Samurai Hatakeyama is in the lead

HATAKEYAMA

(To Ogura)
Without Master Saburo this castle
means nothing to us We are in
accord Our only way is to follow
Master Saburo and die for him We
hear he is in the Fujimaki domains
We are proceeding there Out of our
way if you please

The soldiers of the Third Castle imposingly depart in
formation glaring contemptuously at Ogura and Taro’s
retainers as they go

EXTERIOR - FIELD - DAY

Tango disguised as a hunter comes leading a horse The
retainers rise from the grass Their grazing horses neigh
lifting their heads

RETAINERS
Lord Hirayama

They sit formally with respect Tango lets the retainers take
care of his horse which is carrying a load of food

TANGO
Rice Bean paste and pickled plums
too
(Sits bows to Hidetora
who is a short distance
away )
I Tango Hirayama have followed
you in this guise observing what
was happening to you my lord You
have suffered so much that I could
no longer remain in the shadows
(MORE)

TANGO (CONTD)
Although I have been banished I
would be pleased if you would
accept my service

HIDETORA
(Reacts stands up)
Oh it is you Tango

Ikoma casts a scheming glance at Hidetora then calls to the
retainers who are cheerfully unloading the horse Tango has
brought The gift quickly changes their gloomy mood

IKOMA
Wait We cannot accept food without
good reason Even if it means
starving Samurai cannot accept
charity from farmers

Hearing this Hidetora’s rage is rekindled

HIDETORA
Exactly The farmers should not
have done this Burn the villages
All of them

Tango rushes to Hidetora

TANGO
My lord Wait The farmers are not
to blame They could not ignore
Lord Taro’s orders so they
evacuated their villages to avoid
you

HIDETORA
What did that damned Taro say

TANGO
He issued a proclamation that the
Great Lord was banished and that
anyone who helped him would be
punished with death

Shocked Hidetora gapes and collapses to the stool The
retainers and concubines are speechless as they gaze at their
once-powerful lord Summer cicadas chirp in the otherwise
quiet field After what seems an eternity to Tango Hidetora
turns to him

HIDETORA
Only now have your admonitions been
brought to me

TANGO
Thank you my lord

HIDETORA
Laugh Tango Look what has become
of Hidetora The poor old man
betrayed by his children thrown
out of his two castles has no
place to go

TANGO
My lord You do have a place to go
Master Saburo has found a place
with Lord Fujimaki who wishes him
to be his son-in-law You should go
to him

HIDETORA
How should I You tell me with
what kind of face can I go to
Saburo

TANGO

(Even more strongly)
Great Lord Listen carefully
Master Saburo thinks of nothing but
his father’s welfare It is because
of him that I have disguised myself
like this so that I could be by
your side It is all because of his
orders that I protect you

These words have a deeply moving effect on Hidetora His face
twists in spite of himself Torn between joy and shame the
stern face of a great general disappears giving way to the
face of a frail old father

One of Hidetora’s retainers gallops up

RETAINER
I beg to speak All the soldiers of
the Third Castle have surrendered
the castle to Lord Ogura They
formed ranks and left for the
Fujimaki domains

HIDETORA
What

IKOMA
Now you see what Fujimaki’s

intentions are
(MORE)

IKOMA (CONTD)
First he takes Saburo as a son-in-
law then he takes his soldiers
and then he will take you my lord
so that the House of Ichimonji will
split and fight each other He will
be able to capture this land
without soiling his hands

TANGO
What are you saying Lord Fujimaki
is not a man like that

IKOMA
(Ignores Tango)
My lord let us go to the Third
Castle immediately

Hidetora springs to his feet

TANGO
My lord

He grabs Hidetora’s sleeve

HIDETORA
(Pushes his hand away)
Do not tell me what to do in this
emergency you exile Men First
we go into the Third Castle

RETAINER
The Third Castle has been occupied
by Lord Ogura and his troop

IKOMA
It does not matter Ogura will
understand

Kyoami who has been crouching suddenly looks up and sniffs

KYOAMI
It stinks It is the smell of
rotten guts

Ikoma looks back at him sharply Kyoami shrugs his shoulders
and crouches again Hidetora watches them perplexed

IKOMA
My lord Ogura’s troops are
powerless We can beat them if
necessary

Tango begins to speak but is interrupted

HIDETORA
Get my horse

A retainer comes running with a horse Hidetora hastily
mounts it Tango has no chance to speak

KYOAMI
Go quickly Heaven is far away but
Hell is not

Hidetora turns sharply to Kyoami The next moment with a
fierce glare he strikes Kyoami in the face with his whip

HIDETORA
You cur Do not come if you are
afraid Die

During all this while Hidetora Tango and Ikoma argue the
retainers and ladies-in-waiting are so shocked by the sudden
turn of events that they stand there gaping

EXTERIOR - SAME FIELD - LATER - DAY

The same scene as before but gloomy now with clouds hanging
over it Also the summer grass crushed and broken under the
feet of Hidetora’s men gives the feeling that one is looking
at the traces of man’s evildoing the mood of a pestilence
On it are two unmoving shadows - those of Tango and Kyoami a
fresh welt on his face tears running down over it Tango
looks dolefully at Kyoami

TANGO
We were sincere and spoke the
truth

Kyoami sobbing turns up his face like a crying child

EXTERIOR - THIRD CASTLE - CASTLE GATE - DAY
Hidetora and his party are entering the castle Ikoma and

Ogura are on their knees waiting beside the gate After the
party passes the great doors close squeaking ominously

VOICE
A large army has surrounded the
castle
HIDETORA
(Leaps up)

What Is it Fujimaki
VOICE
No it is Lord Taro at the front
and Lord Jiro at the rear
Hidetora stares in blank amazement for a moment then runs

out of the room with a speed that belies his age The half-
naked woman left on the bed looks shamefully unkempt

Here too soldiers are clamoring With the shooting attack
of the riflers the spear brigade rushes for the gate at the

Hidetora swaying pulls back and calls down the stairs

HIDETORA
Is someone there Call Ikoma Where
is Ogura

Below the stairs a retainer hurriedly putting on his armor
appears

RETAINER
Both have abandoned the castle and
run to the enemy position Great
Lord This is the end

Hidetora his strength drained from his body slips and
tumbles down the stairs like a dead man falling into Hell

A terrible scroll of Hell is shown depicting the fall of the

castle There are no real sounds as the scroll unfolds like a
daytime nightmare It is a scene of human evildoing the way

of the demonic Asura as seen by a Buddha in tears

The music superimposed on these pictures is like the
Buddha’s heart measured in beats of profound anguish the
chanting of a melody full of sorrow that begins like sobbing
and rises gradually as it is repeated like karmic cycles
then finally sounds like the wailing of countless Buddhas

The top story is defended impregnably Shirane and Naganuma
as well as the Samurai who have come rushing up behind them

forearm and fall back on Shirane and Naganuma

Jiro who has been sitting on a stool stands up

JIRO
What My elder brother has been
killed

RETAINER

He was shot by a soldier lying in
ambush with a rifle near the
watchtower on the outworks

JIRO
Oh

KUROGANE
Do not grieve my lord

Kurogane comes out of the smoke Jiro starts as he sees
Kurogane’s cold expression he casts a hurried glance at the
rifle Kurogane is holding

KUROGANE (CONTD)
Such is a warrior’s fortune
yours is better than Master Taro’s
You are hereby Lord Jiro Masatora
head of the House of Ichimonji
106A

107A

Jiro falls into a daze then regains his senses

JIRO
What has happened to my father

RETAINER
He has holed up in the donjon with
the few remaining enemy soldiers

KUROGANE
I suppose he will commit harakiri

He casually tosses aside the rifle he has been holding

INTERIOR - THIRD CASTLE - DONJON - TOP FLOOR - DAY

Hidetora who has been gazing into space bares his stomach
preparing for harakiri and reaches at his waistband for his
dagger - but it is gone Startled he hastily looks around

INTERIOR - THIRD CASTLE - DONJON - BELOW STAIRS - DAY

Naganuma Shirane and other are forced by the onslaught of
arrows to crouch on the stairs Smoke is already rising here
too smoke blown up from below is sucked into the donjon
stairwell

We hear a scream

VOICE
This is the end

The iron battlement doors open on the right and left and
four retainers come tumbling out

RETAINERS
My lord farewell
Goodbye my lord

They stab each other

INTERIOR - THIRD CASTLE - DONJON - TOP FLOOR - DAY

Hidetora is looking for his dagger as desperately as a hunted
animal An honorable death by harakiri means a lot to him
Should he e defeated by a nameless soldier the shame would
be intolerable

EXTERIOR - THIRD CASTLE - KEEP - DAY

Jiro Kurogane and their men run over Smoke pours from the
donjon windows above and tongues of flame lick at the wooden
walls of the lower stories From the entrance emerge
Naganuma Shirane and several Samurai who are running away

Jiro stops looks away

From the donjon entrance comes Hidetora trailing smoke
which wraps around him His white hair is bristling and he
is staggering as if treading on air staring vacantly into
space

Jiro and all the others pull back from the mad Hidetora to
let him pass

EXTERIOR - THIRD CASTLE - EMPTY MOAT - DAY

Jiro gazes at Hidetora from behind then spontaneously runs
after him

KUROGANE
My lord

Jiro stops as if nailed to the ground and stands there
watching his father walk away

KUROGANE (CONTD)

The die is cast Do not hesitate
This road you are taking is a way
of no return Once you step out on
it against your conscience you
must keep going straight without
hesitation The road will lead to
the headship of the House of
Ichimonji You have no choice

Hidetora’s armor and helmet and the Ichimonji standard amid
the hellfire

EXTERIOR - FIELD - DAY

Tango comes racing up on his horse Sitting in back of him
clinging to Tango is Kyoami The horse is running toward the
black smoke belching from a valley in the far foothills A
blast of wind

EXTERIOR - DARK SKY - DAY

Black clouds descend like swooping dragons Then they break
into a thousand shreds that race and fly Rain and lightning
strike the earth

EXTERIOR - FIELD - DAY

Tango racing his horse through the typhoon winds thunder
and rain Kyoami is clinging to his waist

EXTERIOR - WILDERNESS - STORM - DAY

The very wilderness of insanity A small shadow wandering in
the mad gales in the downpour among the thunderclaps and
the lightning bolts

Tango who has raced over on horseback looks at the shadow

TANGO
Who is that

Kyoami strains his eyes and looks then moves up and down on
the horse in a frenzy

KYOAMI
Am I dreaming Oh Heaven forbid

TANGO
The Great Lord

He turns his horse’s head racing after Hidetora at full
gallop

Hidetora’s white hair and beard disheveled in the wind and
drenched by the rain are stuck to his face His fluttering
garments are likewise wrapped around his body He stands up
sharply like a demon god scowling all around him

Tango and Kyoami who have galloped up and jumped off their
horse in front of him are rooted to the ground with fright
at his extraordinary appearance

Hidetora screams at the raging plain

HIDETORA
I am a messenger from Heaven This
is Heaven’s war Smash the rebels
that turn against Heaven Forward
men forward

Tango runs up to him

TANGO
Great Lord Have you gone mad

KYOAMI
(Starts dancing)
Go mad Go mad In this mad world
it is the sane who are mad

HIDETORA
Forward Forward I am the sun

KYOAMI
The Great Lord is great indeed

TANGO
What do you mean

KYOAMI
If you are going to go mad it is
better to think you are the sun
than to think you are a worm

Tango is silent

HIDETORA
Forward men Have no mercy This
is Heaven’s punishment

Kyoami is dancing himself into a frenzy

KYOAMI
Bravo Bravo Men are beasts Kill
them all and the world will be
paradise

Hidetora suddenly becomes quiet and still gazing intently on
some point in the distance Kyoami puts his hand in front of
Hidetora’s eyes and moves it up and down but failing at one
point suddenly straightens

HIDETORA
You have come you have come out
with your hatred for Hidetora Come
on I will give you a taste of
destruction

He is unarmed but he grabs an invisible sword and takes a
fighting stance

Seeing this Kyoami sings a parody of a verse from the Noh
play Funa-benket

KYOAMI
(Sings)
How strange On withered fields I
see an entire clan destroyed by my
hands each one of them floating up
before me

Hidetora runs madly about back and forth left and right
waving his fists Fighting the ghosts of his enemies who are
appearing in front of him Hidetora displays an expression
and bearing that are the extreme of madness

Tango is of course amazed But even Kyoami wants to shield
his eyes as he watches unable to move

Hidetora mad reaches the limits of his strength and
collapses

Tango after a moment pulls himself together and runs over

TANGO
Great Lord

He shakes Hidetora as if clinging to him

TANGO (CONT’D)
Great Lord Come to your senses

Hidetora opens his eyes and looking for a moment at Tango
who is watching him he stands

HIDETORA
Is it you Tango

TANGO
(His face lights up)
Yes my lord

HIDETORA
(Looks around)
Where am I It is cold

He is shivering in the violent wind the rain slanting across
him

TANGO
Kyoami rejoice Our lord has
regained his senses

KYOAMI
That is worse If he were still
mad he would be spared the memory
of what had happened to him

The wind and rain rage violently

HIDETORA
(In a sudden groaning
voice)
Tango hear me I Hidetora was
attacked by Taro and Jiro

Tango is dumbfounded

HIDETORA (CONTD)
Ikoma too betrayed me

Tango is shocked

HIDETORA (CONTD)
And then I was so easily defeated
Now you may laugh at me laugh at
my stupidity Because of my
stupidity my retainers are dead

The rain strikes Hidetora’s face and the wind lifts his
hair He shouts The wind and rain are fiercer than ever

HIDETORA (CONTD)
These are their tears Their
weeping voices

EXTERIOR - VALLEY - DUSK

Autumn has come early to the mountains and in this valley
the autumn flowers mowed down by the storm are scattered
about There is something tragic about the scene as if a
resplendent dress had been discarded

Tango and Kyoami go along the narrow road through the plain
with Hidetora on the horse

At the end of the narrow road stands a miserable straw hut
looking as if it were embraced by the mountain Smoke from
the hearth is quietly rising

Hidetora lies on the horse’s back his face eyes staring
vacantly helplessly swaying

Tango stops the horse in front of the straw hut and calls
inside the house

TANGO
Anybody home

From inside the house a delicate voice is heard

VOICE
Who is it

TANGO
Travelers who have met hardship in
today’s storm Please let us stay a
night

VOICE
My house is too poor to put anyone

up

TANGO
We are not asking for anything
special

VOICE

Because of personal reasons I do
not want to come in contact with

anyone
TANGO

Why Is it a disease
VOICE

No
TANGO

Then please let us in
VOICE

I am sorry I cannot
TANGO

(Irritated)

Listen the Great Lord of the House
of Ichimonji is here

There is no answer and the house becomes completely quiet

TANGO (CONTD)
We are coming in

Then together with Kyoami he carries Hidetora off the
horse opens the door and goes into the straw hut

122 INTERIOR - STRAW HUT - DUSK

A small earthen floor in the corner of it a simple
washstand On the other side of the earthen floor a small
room with a mat laid out It looks as if it might serve as
both sitting room and sleeping room It is already dark
inside the hut In the center of the wooden floor sitting by
the little hearth a figure with long hair in the style of
temple acolytes can be seen in the dim light of the fire

TANGO
Excuse us for coming in with our
shoes on but our lord was suddenly
taken ill

He steps up on the wooden floor and together with Kyoami
carries Hidetora over to the hearth and laying him there
addresses the occupant of the house seemingly a woman

TANGO (CONTD)

(Looks at the occupant)
He is wet Do you have something to
cover him with

The occupant stays seated and does not move

TANGO (CONT’D)
Answer me woman

OCCUPANT
Are you talking to me

TANGO
Yes

The occupant of the house silently rises and goes to a corner
of the room Tango and Kyoami watch the person suspiciously
The occupant seen from behind in the dim light appears to
be looking for something

The occupant rises and comes over silently handing something
over Tango receives it - it is folded clothing He opens it
puts it on Hidetora and stares in surprise It is a
beautiful robe with a colorful design out of keeping with
the humble hut Tango and Kyoami are amazed and curious as
they look at it

TANGO (CONT’D)
Speak up woman

OCCUPANT
I am not a woman
TANGO
What It is so dark I Bring me

a lamp

Tango reaches for a stick of lighted firewood in order to
take a good look at him and notices a cane leaning by the
side of the hearth

TANGO (CONT’D)
I am sorry Is your eyesight poor

He holds up the stick of firewood The occupant of the house
is illuminated in the light from the burning stick It is the
face of a blind but handsome youth Kyoami pulls back with a
start and looks at Tango

TANGO
(Shocked gazes at the
youth)
Are you Lady Sué’s younger
brother Master Tsurumaru

TSURUMARU
Yes

Hidetora sits up turns his eyes and stares at the youth
Then his voice trembling he mutters with a frightened
voice

HIDETORA
Tsu Tsurumaru
TSURUMARU
It has been a long time Lord
Hidetora
HIDETORA
Do you remember me
TSURUMARU

How could I forget you I was just
a child but how could I forget the
one who gouged out my eyes in
exchange for sparing my life the
day you burned down my father’s
castle

Hidetora is trembling

TSURUMARU (CONTD)
I tried hard to follow my sister’s
teachings to pray to the Buddha
and rid myself of hatred But not
one day have I failed to remember
and not one night have I been able
to forget and to sleep peacefully

Hidetora naturally and Tango and Kyoami also stare at the
blind boy speechless

TSURUMARU (CONTD)
Well then I am terribly sorry
that I cannot give you a decent
welcome Great Lord However
fortunately I have a flute that my
sister sent to me I learned to
play it when I was a child I will
play it for you and give you if
nothing else some hospitality of
the heart

The boy takes a flute from the brocade bag beside him

TSURUMARU (CONTD)
Now it is my only pleasure Please
listen and laugh if you will at
my clumsy art

Seated before Hidetora Tango and Kyoami Tsurumaru plays
The clear sound of the flute expresses Tsurumaru’s deep
sorrow and lament It moves Hidetora The old lord staggers
to his feet He clutches at his chest like a man shot with an
arrow His face twitching staring at Tsurumaru with starting
eyes he steps back With trembling lips he tries to say
something but his voice fails him He opens his mouth wide
and lets out a scream that is not a voice then staggers down
to the earthen floor quickly pushes at the door and tumbles
outside

TANGO
My lord

He runs after Hidetora Kyoami follows

EXTERIOR - STRAW HUT - NIGHT

Hidetora staggers over the field scattered with autumn

My dear sister-in-law this was the

Lady Kaede is in the seat of honor with Jiro in front of
her Lined up behind her are the chief retainers in armor
JIRO (CONTD)
It was my accursed turn of fortune
to have to be the one to inform you
of the death in battle of my elder
brother

Kaede stares piercingly at Jiro

KAEDE
(To Ogura beside Jiro)
Ogura where are the remains of
my lord

Ogura looks at Jiro as if asking for help

JIRO
In this sweltering heat the
corpse was so unsightly that we had
to refrain from placing it on view
We had no choice but to cremate it
at the Third Castle and hold an
informal funeral at a nearby
temple

KAEDE
Ogura where are the armor and
helmet he was wearing

Ogura seems to shrink

JIRO
That is sarcasm I think This
armor and this helmet I am wearing
now are the ones he was wearing
You have not forgotten have you

KAEDE
I have not forgotten But I never
thought you could wear his armor
and helmet so soon after his death
It is too much for me to notice

JIRO

I am surprised at you I thought my
deceased brother would be happy to
know that his younger brother
returned to the castle in his
armor No it was foolish of me
Forgive me

(Bows to her rises)
I am taking off this armor
Somebody help me

An attendant runs over and starts taking off his armor
Taro’s retainers become intently still at this

JIRO (CONTD)
Sister-in-law I am about to be
naked

Kaede quietly rises and goes out

KUROGANE
(to Ikoma and Ogura)
You have worked hard for us on this
occasion of the Ichimonji family
trouble We appreciate it

Ikoma and Ogura bow

KUROGANE (CONTD)
As a token of our thanks we have
prepared a humble gift for you

Two low wooden stands each with a pile of gold coins are
placed in front of Ikoma and Ogura

KUROGANE (CONTD)
Please accept it

Ikoma and Ogura bow deeply to Jiro

JIRO
(Nods )
It is my farewell gift for you
(Pause)
Goodbye

Ikoma and Ogura look at him in amazement

KUROGANE
Lord Jiro is now the head of the

House of Ichimonji
(MORE)

KUROGANE (CONTD)
Considering his situation and what
you did to your master this time
he thinks it is not very wise to
keep you who committed treason on
his staff It would be dangerous
His concern is understandable We
have nothing further to say

(Pause)
Let there be no hard feelings

Ikoma and Ogura look at each other and start to say
something

KUROGANE (CONTD)
(Interrupting)
Do you understand Good Thank you

Ikoma and Ogura are helpless

VOICE
(From downstairs)
I beg to speak Lady Kaede is
entering

Kurogane looks at Jiro his eyes implying “Watch out” Jiro
nods readily

KUROGANE
(Calling downstairs)
Send her in
(To Jiro)
Let us withdraw
(Rises)

Shirane and Naganuma also rise and follow Kurogane carrying
the money-laden stands Ikoma and Ogura are too shocked to
stand

Lady Kaede is coming up the stairs Seeing her Ogura jumps
to his feet hurriedly follows Shirane and Naganuma as if
fleeing and descends the stairs Ikoma too has no other
course than to follow them

Lady Kaede sits in front of Jiro placing Taro’s helmet at
her side and bows with both hands on the floor

KAEDE
Congratulations on your victory

JIRO
Sister-in-law you overwhelm me

KAEDE
I am ashamed of the wretched things
I said before

JIRO
It does not matter

KAEDE
I understand your father has gone
mad

JIRO
I suppose you are satisfied

KAEDE
Now what night that mean

JIRO
Sister-in-law I spoke bluntly
hiding nothing in my mind Forgive
me if I have offended you But one
would expect you to bear an intense
hatred for my father as the enemy
of your family Am I wrong

KAEDE
(Looking into his eyes)
Then let me talk frankly too Lord
Jiro I dare say you are also
satisfied

Jiros eyes return her stare

She slides the helmet at her side toward Jiro His eyes stray

for an instant to the helmet At this unguarded moment Lady

KAEDE (CONTD)
(Looking at him not to be
stared down)
Lord Jiro you are now head of the
House of Ichimonji This helmet
too belongs to you

Kaede suddenly jumps on him and pushes him down She
unsheathes his sword and bends over him holding it to his

throat

KAEDE (CONTD)
Lord Jiro You have driven your
father insane and murdered your
brother and stolen this realm -
splendid work But I Kaede will
not forgive you Foe of my husband
prepare to die

Her voice is low and thick Her expression of rage is even
more dreadful because of her beauty Jiro is unable to move
the sword held to the base of his throat

JIRO

KAEDE
To say that in this situation how
cowardly you are

She cuts his skin with the tip of the sword The blood oozes
out

JIRO
(Deathly pale)
It was not me who killed
my brother

KAEDE
Then who was it

Jiro refuses to say

KAEDE (CONTD)
Tell me Who was it

She again jabs the skin at his throat Blood oozes out

JIRO
It was not me Kurogane
Kurogane shot him

KAEDE
Hold your tongue You mean you
ordered your retainer to do it but
cannot take the responsibility
What a general

She suddenly starts laughing and raises herself off him then
grabs the long sword at Jiro’s side and leaps back Jiro
too jumps up pressing his hand to his throat Kaede
holding the dagger in one hand and the long sword in the
other is laughing Jiro stares at her with his hand to his
throat When she finally stops laughing she gazes at him
with a faint smile

KAEDE (CONTD)
You give in so easily You are
undependable Now I must speak my
mind straightforwardly Lord Jiro
I could not care less about my
husband’s death

Jiro is puzzled

KAEDE (CONTD)
But I am worried about what is
going to become of me I do not
want to live as a widow with my
hair cut nor as a nun with my head
shaved bald This was my father’s
castle and I do not want to be
forced to leave it

Jiro is overwhelmed by the strength in her voice and
expression

KAEDE (CONTD)
Lord Jiro Please hear my request
I will not tell anything your
immoral acts of treason stealing
this castle and this realm nor
will my lips ever repeat the
cowardly words so unworthy of a
master accusing his vassal in
order to save his own life If I
told anyone this realm would be
torn apart No I will not

She casts aside the long sword and with the same hand grabs
her long dress and draws it toward her Then she cuts it to
shreds with her dagger

KAEDE (CONTD)
But remember I could destroy it
like this What do you say Lord
Jiro

Jiro gazes at her aghast trembling Lady Kaede throwing
her dagger away jumps on him embraces him kisses him They
stagger his foot is caught in the hem of her long dress
They fall their mouths together When she pulls her lips
away form his she presses them against the wound in his
throat and sucks his blood

The midsummer sun clearly illuminates the scene From under
her ruined dress her white legs are seen a toe kicks at
Taro’s helmet The orb design on the plume catches a direct
ray of sunlight and gleams

heavily and looks out the window turning away from Kaede
Kaede is lying with her hair still undone her clothes
disordered Summer sunlight illuminates the two of them

The clouds massed in a peak seen in sections through the
windows Noisy voices of cicadas

KAEDE
(In a soft voice)
My lord

Jiro casts an exploring look at Kaede She is silent the
back of her disheveled figure still turned to him

JIRO
What is it sister-in-law

KAEDE
How cold you are Calling me sister-
in-law after what we have just
done

Jiro is silent
KAEDE (CONTD)

Now that we have done this I
should be your wife

In her expression unseen by Jiro is a snakelike tenacity
that her voice completely belies Jiro looks at her from
behind and sighs

JIRO
But I already have Sué as my wife

A tiny moth flutters its wings before her downcast eyes She
quietly stretches out the hand she has placed under her chin
and casually crushes it

KAEDE
Then am I to be your
mistress
(In tears)
No no You are mine I will not

let anyone else have you
Jiro edges toward her and places his hand on her shoulder
JIRO

Do not cry Kaede I would never
dream of making you a mistress

KAEDE
But as long as the Lady Sué is
there
JIRO
I can take care of her
KAEDE
How
JIRO

I will divorce her

KAEDE
No No

She springs up and grabs him by the chest

KAEDE (CONTD)
The way things have turned out I
cannot forgive any woman who has
known your touch I do not want
such a woman to live at the same
time as I

Jiro winces She holds him in her arms and looks directly
into his eyes

Hidetora has completely changed his eyes are sunken his
wrinkles are deepened his disheveled white hair and beard

Kyoami who had been leaning against the stone wall weaving
grass presents the strangely shaped hat he has woven to the
dispirited Hidetora

KYOAMI
Your helmet my lord

Hidetora accepts it and joyfully puts it on Tango looks at
it depressed Kyoami breaks off two lilies at his side and
sticks them in Hidetora’s hat

KYOAMI (CONTD)

with her fine But for Lady Sué to
be killed for that It is right to
kill someone when you must But
killing someone unnecessarily I am
afraid I must decline such a
preposterous command

Jiro with nothing to say keeps gazing out the window

Lady Kaede in mourning rosary in hand comes up the stairs
Kurogane bows

KAEDE
Kurogane There is salt at the
Second Castle is there not

KUROGANE
Yes there is Why

KAEDE
I mean if you bring her head back
without preserving it in salt in
this heat we shall have to refrain
from looking at it

Kurogane is shocked

KAEDE (CONT’D)
That is too merciless a thing to do
to such a beautiful lady Since you
are going personally Kurogane I
know there will be no error I
leave the matter to you Do as you
see fit

KUROGANE
Yes my lady

Jiro quietly watches Lady Kaede

145 INTERIOR - REMAINS OF AZUSA CASTLE - UNDERGROUND STOREROOM - DAY

Hidetora is asleep Kyoami beside him examines the old
man’s haggard face

KYOAMI
Why am I still serving such a crazy
old man If the rock upon which you
are seated starts to roll down a
slope you must jump off Otherwise
you will be crushed together with
the rock Only fools remain on a
falling rock

He stands and starts for the exit

HIDETORA
Where am I

Kyoami looks back at him and sighs

KYOAMI

This is Heaven

(Returns to Hidetora

helps him lie down again)
Be a good boy Go to sleep

(Sits beside him)
Amazing I think it has been my
work since I was a child to rock
him to sleep

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DONJON - TOP FLOOR - DAY

The Ichimonji standard Taro’s armor and his helmet with its
orb plume and colored braids displayed on the alcove Jiro
and Lady Kaede are making love in the daytime in front of
the display All the more appealing is that she is in
mourning clothes

A voice is heard from below the stairs

VOICE
General Kurogane is here

Jiro and Lady Kaede are alarmed They quickly straighten
their clothes

JIRO
Let him in

Kurogane comes up the stairs holding in his hand a package
wrapped in white figured silk He lays it by his knees and
prostrates himself before Jiro and Lady Kaede

KUROGANE
I have returned my lord

Jiro cannot take his eyes away from the package wrapped in
silk by Kurogane’s knees and is silent Lady Kaede merely
glancing at it answers for Jiro

KAEDE
Thank you for you trouble

KUROGANE
Not at all my lady Now then the
article I have brought according to
your precise instructions please
have a good look

He takes the package and presents it to Kaede Jiro
trembling looks at it then turns his eyes to Kurogane with
a look of censure Kurogane with a look of feigned
innocence is watching Lady Kaede

KAEDE
(Looking at Jiro from the
corner of her eyes)
Well then I shall first examine
it

She pulls the package of white silk to her with a casual air
that contrasts with Jiro’s trembling face Jiro turns his
eyes away

Kaede unwraps the many layers of the package As it is
unwrapped salt falls out then finally a large lump of salt
appears Kaede’s long beautiful fingers brush away the salt
All of a sudden she turns white

KAEDE (CONTD)
What is this Kurogane your joking
has gone too far

KUROGANE
You do not like it Did I overlook
something

KAEDE
How dare you

She thrusts the package aside The lump of salt breaks open
and falls away and a stone fox’s head rolls out Jiro stares
at it in mute amazement then quickly looks at Kurogane

KUROGANE
What is this Lady Sué whom I
killed must have been a fox in
disguise I have been tricked

KAEDE
You have joked enough This is from
a fox statue from an Inari shrine

KUROGANE
Well this is a crafty fox After
disguising itself as a human it
then turned to stone

KAEDE
Kurogane Do you intend to make a
fool of me

KUROGANE

Not at all There are a lot of
foxes around here and it is said
that they often trick men

(To Jiro)
You too my lord must be careful
Foxes often take the form of a
woman in order to work their evil
deeds Far away in Central Asia
a fox which disguised itself as
the wife of King Pan Tsu made the
king kill a thousand men and later
in China during the Chou dynasty
there was one who became the queen
consort of King Yu and destroyed
his country Here in Japan the fox
served at court as Princess Tamamo
and worked even more treachery It
is said that she finally turned
into a white fox with nine tails
After that there was no trace of
the white fox It is possible it
might have settled down around
here Be careful my lord be
careful Excuse me

Kurogane rattles off his entire swift speech in one breath
without stopping then bows and exits Kaede and Jiro are
left defeated

KAEDE
(Glares at Jiro)
Lord Jiro Is this how you respond
to my request How can you conspire
with Kurogane to fool me like this

JIRO
No Kaede You are wrong

KAEDE
I have had enough

She rises and crosses to the stairs followed by Jiro

JIRO
Wait Kaede This is Kurogane’s

KAEDE
It is always Kurogane Is he your
only retainer He has already acted
the villain killing Lord Taro Now
he has played hero saving Lady
Sué He is a monster And you call
him your right arm What a pity

Jiro is silent

KAEDE (CONT’D)
I shall not see you again until I
see Lady Sué’s head

She descends the stairs Jiro is immobile at the top of the
stairs straight as a stick

SUE

What shall we do
OLD WOMAN
You must hurry because as Kurogane
said we will have someone after us

No my lady You wanted to see the
remains of your family’s castle so
we are taking this detour Hurry

pray for your ruined family Once
in another domain you will never
be able to visit it again

Sué is silent filled with emotion

She hands the bundles to Sué and trudges back along the

taking care of a child When Hidetora nears the stone wall
Kyoami pulls him back to safety When Hidetora crouches
Kyoami stops and patiently waits on him His attitude is
kind but his words are rough as if he were master and
Hidetora his servant

The passage they are treading is bleak and devastated The
two look as if they were the only survivors of the world’s
final carnage And their conversation too sounds as if they
were in some other world muttering about human beings and
their stupidity

KYOAMI

Heaven and earth have turned upside
down I was mad and made him laugh
before But now he is mad and makes
me laugh Come do not be silent
Say something You speak of
nonsense I speak of truth Let us
see if our conversation can
continue smoothly Now

Hidetora who has been gazing absently at a point in space
reacts and regards Kyoami

HIDETORA
Where am I

KYOAMI
A snake’s egg is white and
beautiful A bird’s egg is spotted

and dirty

HIDETORA
This is a castle There is a stone
wall

KYOAMI

The little bird deserted the dirty
egg and sat on the white one

HIDETORA
(Looks up at the wall)
Strange
KYOAMI

A snake emerged from the hatched
egg

HIDETORA
There is nothing on the wall

KYOAMI
The bird raised the snake only to
fall prey to it

HIDETORA
Where am I Who am I

KYOAMI
The bird was stupid

HIDETORA

Kyoami looks hopefully at Hidetora

HIDETORA (CONTD)

KYOAMI
If a madman goes mad again will he
become sane

HIDETORA
I am a worm Do not crush me

KYOAMI
You will not be crushed Miserable
worms are not even worth being
crushed

HIDETORA
Who are you

Kyoami in despair pushes Hidetora away crouches and
starts crying

HIDETORA (CONTD)

crying
Kyoami suddenly springs up and shouts
KYOAMI

born They die after they have
cried enough

they possibly do

Another messenger comes running

MESSENGER
A message from Lord Saburo

JIRO
What What does it say

MESSENGER
“Saburo has come to receive his
father”

Jiro looks puzzled

MESSENGER (CONTD)
“Unless he is interfered with

message

Surprised not expecting this message they look at each

calmly Their banners and bannerets are azure waving in the
summer breeze

Saburo Tango and Hatakeyama are looking up at the mountain
ridge behind them The ridge is lined with waves of
Fujimaki’s soldiers and their white banners

SABURO
That embarrasses me I told him
repeatedly that I do not need his
support

TANGO
You do not have to be embarrassed
Thanks to Lord Fujimaki’s
demonstration of his possible
invasion the enemy on this
Hachiman Field cannot make an
aggressive move It also enables us
to rescue the Great Lord from Azusa
Field

SABURO
But this aggressive deployment of
his army is not a peaceful way One
wrong move might provoke a war
That embarrasses me

158 EXTERIOR - BOUNDARY RIVER - DAY

Fujimaki with his army behind him turns to an old general

FUJIMAKI
Am I too hasty

FUJIMAKI (CONTD)

My lord You should not fight now
Send a messenger that you will let
Lord Saburo have the Great Lord
and avoid this war

JIRO
How can I let him have my father
If I did Saburo in alliance with
him would soon raise his banners
against me using the excuse that
he would punish my men for treason

KUROGANE
But even if we wanted to give up
the Great Lord we do not know
where he is

Jiro is silent

KUROGANE (CONTD)
At present the people of our land
are in confusion and distress
because of this series of changes
in rulership And Fujimaki and
Ayabe are seeking a chance to
invade by making use of the
confusion Now is the time for
defense not offense

KAEDE
How stupid

Jiro at the ceremony of congratulations is about to drink
he stops and looks at her

KAEDE (CONTD)

Giving the Great Lord to Lord
Saburo means giving him your own
head my lord

JIRO
I said so too

KAEDE
Then why did you alter your
opinion Did Kurogane change your
mind again
JIRO
But it is not a good time for us
to fight

KAEDE

Good leadership decides who wins
Now you lead Why be afraid of
Fujimaki and Ayabe This is your
chance to beat them and make their
domains yours As leader of the
House of Ichimonji you should have
that ambition

Jiro is overwhelmed by her eloquence

KAEDE (CONT’D)
In the first place it was a
grievous mistake to have spared the
Great Lord even though he had gone
mad Mercy is not necessary for a
Samurai

JIRO
But how can I kill my father when I
do not know where he is

KAEDE
(Laughs )
Lord Saburo knows where he is He
would not want to take a missing
man home if he had not known

Jiro reacts

KAEDE (CONT’D)
Tell Lord Saburo that he can have
his father Watch carefully how he
moves and if he goes anywhere
tail him You will find where you
father is Then send assassins to
him and that will end it

She picks up the saké server and pours Jiro a drink

abuse

welcome We will counterattack and

(Shouts )
Halt That is enough

EXTERIOR - AZUSA FIELD - SUNSET

Saburo’s party in single file is crossing the field toward
the Fujimaki realm Saburo is in the lead Hidetora seated
behind him on the same horse Tango following carrying
Kyoami on his horse They are quietly advancing in the soft
light of the setting sun - a picturesque sight

Suddenly the serenity is broken by gunshots Several mounted
Samurai fall from their horses Hidetora holding Saburo from
behind realizes that his son suddenly goes limp his head
drooping

HIDETORA
(Surprised)
Saburo What is wrong Saburo

Saburo is silent His body slowly tilts then finally falls
from his horse together with Hidetora who is clinging to
him

Tango and Kyoami shocked dismount and run to them
Hidetora bending over Saburo suddenly looks up at Tango and
Kyoami seeking rescue he shouts in grief His voice is so
sad it seems his heart is breaking

HIDETORA (CONTD)
My son is dead I can still tell
the living from the dead Saburo is
dead I am alive you are alive
but Saburo is not Saburo You must
not die so soon I have something
to tell you I owe you an apology
Can this be fair Saburo Come back
to life

TANGO
Great Lord Compose yourself

HIDETORA
Do not approach me Saburo is dead
Every one of you is a murderer
Every one deserves death

TANGO
Great Lord Great Lord

HIDETORA
Who are you It is getting dark
Damn old fool I can no longer
live I am suffocating Someone
open my chest

Kyoami quickly loosens his clothes at the chest

HIDETORA (CONTD)
(Screams )

Saburo
(Goes limp)

It is the last of the great warrior who once reigned supreme
Kyoami clings to him

KYOAMI
Great Lord Great Lord

Tango watches everything in deep sorrow

TANGO
Kyoami You must not call back his
soul You must not let him wander
in this hellish world any longer

Tango and Kyoami as well as Saburo’s men who are surrounding
the corpse silently behold the horrible sight of death the
old warlord lying atop his lifeless son

Over track we hear hoofbeats A messenger comes riding up

MESSENGER
We have won The enemy is
retreating toward the First Castle

TANGO
(More sorrowful than
pleased)
What is this Of all things Master
Saburo is no longer with us to
hear The Great Lord is no longer
here to see it Why Why

Kyoami suddenly rises and spits toward Heaven

KYOAMI

(Yelling)
Is there no God or Buddha in this
world Damnation God and the
Buddha are nothing but mischievous
urchins Are they so bored in
Heaven that they enjoy watching men
die like worms Damn God Is it so
amusing to see and hear human
beings cry and scream

TANGO
Enough Do not slander God or the
Buddha They are the ones who are
crying The evil of human beings
the stupidity of the sinful
creatures who believe their
survival depends on killing others
repeated again and again throughout
all time Even God or the Buddha
cannot save us from it

Kyoami bursts out crying loudly

TANGO (CONTD)
Do not cry This is nothing unusual
in this mortal world Human beings
seek sorrow not happiness and
prefer suffering to peace Look at
the First Castle Those stupid
people are fighting for sorrow and
suffering reveling in murder and
bloodshed

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - SUNSET

Shouts screams destruction and massacre Sounds of carnage
and turmoil fill the castle - clanking swords and spears
storming footsteps neighing horses whistling arrows
reports of guns

Soldiers charging clouds of dust Banners and spearheads
appearing and disappearing in the haze Soldiers friend and
foe swarming toward the front gate which is about to be
closed They fight to enter the castle before the gate is
closed and squeeze themselves through the gap between the
doors Banners and bannerets of Ichimonji and Ayabe
intermingle with each other

OMITTED

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - SQUARE - SUNSET

The front gate is closed Two groups of soldiers from both
sides are trapped in the square between the gates They
desperately struggle and fight for their lives the slaughter
going unobserved

From the tower and the firing battlements above the square
bullets shower on the soldiers killing them at random
friend and foe alike Gunfire flashing in the slanting
sunbeams in the sunset

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DONJON - PASSAGE - SUNSET

Jiro Kurogane Shirane and Naganuma are silently watching
the confusion uncomprehendingly Samurai and soldiers are

running in all directions not knowing what to do Jiro and
the other generals have no way of quelling the confusion

From the crazed mob a spirited Samurai carrying something
wrapped under his arm runs toward Jiro

SAMURAI
My lord My lord

KUROGANE
(To Samurai)
Is it the Lord Saburo’s head Or
the Great Lord’s Either way it is
of no use now

SAMURAI
No My lord ordered me to bring
Lady Sué’s head

Astonished Kurogane wrests the wrapping from the Samurai and
opens it The cloth contains a beautiful floral design

EXTERIOR - TSURUMARU’S HUT - SUNSET

Two corpses are resting on the grass and flowers of the field
- the old woman and Lady Sué The young lady’s neck is
covered with a bundle of wild flowers which were picked by
rough hands but her slender white arm is revealed from under
her torn sleeve The hand clasps Tsurumaru’s flute - a sad
and cruel sight

190A

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DONJON - PASSAGE - SUNSET

Kurogane looks up away from the wrapping glares fiercely at
Jiro

KUROGANE
Is the master of this castle you or
Lady Kaede I serve you my lord
but not Lady Kaede
(Runs to donjon)

JIRO
Wait
(Pursues )

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - CASTLE GATE - SUNSET

Fire arrows flying

INTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - DONJON - LADY KAEDE’S ROOM - SUNSET

Despite the confusion and clamor Lady Kaede is quietly
seated ignoring the women who run about seeking refuge Her
lips display a cold smile as if she were enjoying the
turmoil

The door bangs open and Kurogane rushes in

KUROGANE
Vixen You fooled the lord You
caused him to do useless things
and you have now destroyed the
House of Ichimonji Now you should
know the shallowness and stupidity
of a woman’s wisdom

KAEDE
(Calmly )
It is not shallow or stupid I
wanted to see this castle burn and
the House of Ichimonji ruined by
the long grudge of my family I
wanted to see all this

KUROGANE
To Hell with you

He draws his sword and kills her with a single stroke A
stream of smoke comes hovering over the blood-drenched corpse
of Lady Kaede The smoke creeps to Jiro too who is standing
aghast watching the body of his treacherous woman

KUROGANE (CONTD)
(To Jiro)
There is no escape Prepare to die
I will follow you later

EXTERIOR - FIRST CASTLE - SUNSET

The castle is belching fire and smoke The Ayabe soldiers are
cheering and dancing crazily as they look up at the castle in
flames

EXTERIOR - AZUSA FIELD - SUNSET

Saburo’s party reduced in number is crossing the field in
the glow of the evening Two groups of soldiers are carrying
the corpses of Saburo and Hidetora on crossed spears Tango
and Kyoami as well as Saburo’s guards are silently following

Saburo’s troops led by Hatakeyama and the Fujimaki cavalry
are sweeping the summer field like a black tide They see the
corpses of Saburo and Hidetora and lower their spears in
mourning

FUJIMAKI
Alas Of all things
(Discouraged his head
drops then he looks up)
Men Let us avenge my son-in-law
Follow me We will take the First
Castle

TANGO

(Stops him)
That is not necessary Master
Saburo had no ambition He wanted
to avoid war You had better
withdraw your army today out of
mourning for Master Saburo and
pray for him

Fujimaki nods raises his whip and bisects the surrounding
cavalry to make way for Saburo’s troops Those with the
bodies of Saburo and Hidetora resume their advance

Twilight creeps to the field darkening the figures of these
humans who have seen hell in this world The glow of the
evening is as red as blood slowly paling giving way to
dusk Azusa Field is beginning to disappear under the cloak
of evening

Far beyond the field upon the stone walls of the remains of
Azusa Castle a small figure is seen
193A

193B

EXTERIOR - REMAINS OF AZUSA CASTLE - STONE WALL - SUNSET

Tsurumaru wanders alone cane in hand His cane knocks at the
stones at the top of the wall then finds nothing further
Surprised he steps back The scroll falls from his hand
rolls down the high wall of the donjon opens and lands on
the grass in the empty moat

The picture of the Amitabha torn in places shines golden in
the last light from the darkening sky The face of the
Amitabha looks sad as it gazes at the upper side of the wall

EXTERIOR - AZUSA FIELD - SUNSET

On top of the steep stone wall Tsurumaru is at a loss

The evening glow is now in its final stages The last light
of day will soon fade and darkness will reign over the
realm

Against the background of the last glow of evening the small

figure of Tsurumaru is standing alone on the lofty stone wall
in the remains of the castle

Wretchedness

THE END
