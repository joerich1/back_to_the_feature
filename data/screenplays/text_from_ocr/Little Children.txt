My husband and I had an actual spiritual

experience
EXT WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND - DAY

phis is THERESA mid-thirties a pale woman but in her time a real
auty

THERESA
»-We were on our vacation in Cabo with
eight other couples and this Mayan
woman a goddess just a goddess

CUT TO
MARY ANN mid-thirties toothpick-thin uptight and clad in

CATALOGUE CASUAL

BARY ANN
She’s due in September She says she’s
gonna take three months off and be back
to work before Christmas Please Six
months from now she’1l be right here on
this bench with us

CHERYL a woman who has the unfortunate habit of ending her sentences

with an wpwardy teenagery question mark

CHERYL
Well my friend Beth said the way she did
it was to just take him with her every
time she went to the bathroom

MARY ANN
I find that strange

CHERYL
Thats what I said to Beth

MARY ANN
It’s oedipal

THERESA
Whats the rush Although I will say
when I was potty training Christian I
opened the diaper and it was huge like a
grown man

Snatches of the women talking begin a slow diminuendo as they shift

to the subject of pre-schools

On the bench opposite the women is SARAH PIERCE 30 It is through
at we have been introduced to these ladies And because

Sarah’s ears t ‘
of this our idea of them may be less than kind

As we PUSH IN on her — A NEW VOICE EMERGES IT IS MALE CALM AND NON-

JUDGMENTAL IN SHORT GROWN-UP

VOICE
Smiling politely to mask a familiar
feeling of desperation Sarah reminded
herself to think like an anthropologist
She was a researcher studying the
behavior of typical suburban women She
was not a typical suburban woman herself

CHERYL
John and I were having sex the other
night and I drifted off right in the
middle of it

THERESA
chuckles sympathetically)
It happens
CHERYL
I guess But when I woke up and
apologized He said he hadn’t even
noticed

MARY ANN
You know what you should do Set aside a
specific block of time for making love
Thats what Lewis and I do Every Tuesday
night at nine o’clock

VOICE
Whether you want to or not Sarah
thought her eyes straying over to the
play area

CHRISTIAN Theresa’s son pummels Mary Anns cowering TROY and —

Cheryl’s COURTNEY shows Mary Ann’s ISABELLE her DORA THE EXPLORER
underpants

VOICE
Even at such a tiny playground as this
Lucy didn’t interact much with the other
children

Sarahs three-year-old daughter LUCY stands alone near the top of
the slide She appears to talking to herself

Sarah takes her in

VOICE
Sarah didn’t really know why they even
bothered coming here except that she’d
probably go crazy trapped in the house
all day with this unknowable little
person

CLOSE ON a watch face The second hand sweeps past twelve

YOICE
Morning snack time was ten thirty on the
dot A regimen established and maintained

by Mary Ann

MARY ANN’s face fills the screen as she turns and soundlessly barks
toward the playground

VOICE
«-who believed that rigid adherence to a
timetable

The children all turn toward Mary Ann in SLOW MOTION and start
running in her direction

VOICE
---Was not only the key to a healthy
marriage but to effective parenting as
well
CLOSE ON HANDS DIGGING THROUGH A DIAPER BAG

LUCY 0€)
Mommy

All the kids and their mothers are gathered around a picnic table
shoveling CHEERIOS and GOLDFISH inte their mouths —

Except for Sarah who is crouched down on the grass a few feet away
rummaging through a diaper bag Lucy stands facing her mother an
anxious look on the childs face
Lucy
Where my snack
SARAH
(digging through bag
I’m sure it’s in here somewhere

Lucy
Where it went Where my snack
SARAH
I’m sorry honey Mommy can’t find it
to other mothers)
I forgot the rice cakes I must have left
them on the counter

AT THE PICNIC BENCH the three women and their offspring watch the
drama that is playing out on the grass before them

CHERYL
Poor thing

LUCY (0C)
I want my snaaaack

MARY ANN
(pointed)
That’s the second time this week

THERESA
It’s hard to keep track of everything

LUCY (0C)
Bad Mommy bad mommy bad momay

BACK TO SARAH and LUCY
SARAH
pleading)
dust calm down
Lucy
No No calm down

SARAH
It’s not here

Sarah hands her the bag
SARAH
Alright here See for yourself

Lucy looks into the bag and then throws it at her mother’s head
Sarah winds wp with the strap dangling around her neck

MARY ANN
Wait

This single word radiates with such undeniable adult authority that
everything stops
MARY ANN
Troy honey Give Lucy your Goldfish

TROY
Not

He turns his body forming a barrier between Lucy ahd his snack

MARY ANN
Troy Jonathan Give me those Goldfish

h TROY
(whimpering)
But mama they’re mine

MARY ANN
No backtalk You can share with your
sister

With no further word of protest Troy hands the BAG to Mary Ann

SARAH
(to Lucy)
Go and sit down Troy has goldfish for
you

Lucy runs over to join the others at the picnic bench
SARAH

(to Mary Ann)
Thank you Youre a lifesaver

MARY ANN
Its nothing I just hate to see her
suffer like that
Sarah gets down on one knee and begins refilling the diaper bag
MARY ANN
Maybe you should make a check list tape
it to the door so it’s the last thing you
see before leaving the house That’s what
I do
Sarah looks up forcing a smile

SARAB
Thank you That’s a really helpful
suggestion

Bw
Cheryls head darts away from the other mothers She reaches across
the table and grabs Theresa’s hand

CHERYL
soft and urgent)
Look

Theresa glances instinctively toward the PLAY STRUCTURE

THERESA
What
CHERYL
Over there The Prom King
THERESA
(smiling)

Oh my God He’s back

Sarah looks up from the diaper bag

VOICE
Sarah followed the other women’s gazes
over to the entrance of the playground
eager to finally get a glimpse of the
Prom King

In the middle distance we see a strap ing BLOND MAN enter through
the park’s iron gate He pushes a DO STROLLER One side is empty
and the other is occupied by a large STUFFED BEAR The man’s three
year-old son sits perched on his father’s shoulders He wears a
JESTERS CAP and shoots his arms out as if he is flying

VOICE
the handsome and mysterious young
father who had been a regular at the
Walker Street Playground for several
weeks this past spring before abruptly
dropping out of sight

With the ease of someone performing a familiar action the man lifts
his son off his shoulders and gallops around the play structure The
boy squeals as the man bobs hops and weaves - giving the boy the
time of his life Unlike the young mothers on the benches watching
their children from a distance this man is engaged As if he
couldn’t imagine doing anything else with anyone else More playmate
than parent

VOICE
His departure had left a gaping hole in
the emotional lives of Cheryl Theresa
and Mary Ann Barely a day went by
without one of them speculating wistfully
about the reason for his absence and the
likelihood of his return

of a long circuit of daily push-ups

LIVING ROOM — LATER (MAGIC)
Brad and Aaron sit on the floor engrossed in their favorite activity
Train Wreck a brutally simple game GORDON and PERCY two characters
from Thomas the Tank Engine move in opposite directions around a
circular track making happy CHUGGING SOUNDS right up to the moment of
an inevitable collision
(shouting)
shouting
Splang

This is the sound effect that always accompanies the crash
AARON
Take that Gordon

BRAD
Ouch That hurt Percy
Aaron laughs uproariously at Brad’s pain

AARON
Again Again

They set-up for another go and repeat the game

The game ends abruptly though as Aaron scrambles to his feet and
stares toward the The SOUND of someone coming through the FRONT DOOR

7 AARON
lommy

He rips the Jester cap off his head and flings it away

Brad watches the haberdashery make a wide arc in the air He cannot
take his eyes from it Time seems to momentarily stop

VOICE
The Jester’s cap was something that truly
disturbed Brad All day long The boy ate
played and napped in it He would burst
into tears if his Father had so much
suggested it be removed
VOICE (CONT)
But the moment his Mother stepped in the
house he had no more use for it as if the
entire day up to that point had been a
pointless and somewhat useless charade

Aaron flies into the arms of KATHY 30 and lovely She drops to one
knee and holds her arms out wide

KATRY
I missed you so so so so much

He buries his face against her chest she strokes his head
KATEY
You got some color didnt you Did daddy
forget the sunscreen again

Brad stares down at the engine he still holds Gordons peevish
expression feels like it’s mocking him

INT BRAD’S HOUSE KITCHEN MAGIC
Brad Kathy and Aaron sit around the table at the tail end of dinner
BRAD
I think I’m gonna finally break down and
get a mobile phone
KATHY
Really Why
BRAD
I have no way of reaching you when Im
out with Aaron
KATHY
to Aaron
You’re done right
She rises to clear the boy’s dish and carries it over to the sink
BRAD

- youve got one Dont you think it’s
strange I dont

KATHY
Yeah I do You just never wanted one
before
She wets a towel and heads back over to Aaron
BRAD
Yeah I know There’s a family plan We
can talk for free

Kathy cleans the dinner from Aarons face and in the process turns
her back on an uncomfortable fiscal conversation

KATHY
Lets see where we are at the end of the
month
EXT MAIN STREET — TWILIGHT

Carrying a briefcase Brad walks alone along an empty street He passes
an SUV swathed in graphics for the National Guard A recruiting vehicle
and handy piece of mobile advertisement A TRIO OF DRAB GREEN CLAD
SOLDIERS stare back at him defiant and brave

VOICE
As was her custom each weeknight after
dinner the boy’s mother sent Brad down
to the Municipal library to study for
the bar exam

EXT MUNICIPAL LIBRARY TWILIGHT

VOICE
-but he never quite made it through the
door of the building

Brad settles in on a bench About twenty yards away FOUR
SKATEBOARDERS ages thirteen to sixteen dressed in knee-length
shorts baggy T-shirts and fashionably retro sneakers - jump stairs
metal railings and retaining walls around a square granite
building They are all armed with iPODS and MOBILE PHONES

VOICE
Brad had been watching the boys for weeks
now sometimes for as long as an hour at a
stretch but he’d never received the
slightest acknowledgement from any of them

Brad stares longingly

VOICE
He had been the same age as these boys
when his mother died

ONE OF THE BOYS the one the others call G ramps off a wall and
sails into the air He possesses an almost mystical connection to his
board G returns to the group who congratulate him on his last ride

VOICE
I must have been like this Brad
sometimes thought I must have been one
of them

MARY ANN 0C)
He should just be castrated

EXT WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND DAY

CLOSE ON the same handbill from the news broadcast with the addition of
a stepped-up headline Decent people Beware There is a Pervert Among
iS

The MOTHERS all stare down at the FLYER on the picnic table

MARY ANN
Quick and clean Just chop it off Then
you wouldnt have to worry about
notifying the neighbors
o

SARAH

You know what else you should do Nail
his penis above the entrance to the
elementary school You know as a warning
to other perverts

Cheryl and Theresa chuckle politely at her sarcasm Mary Ann is not
amused and fixes Sarah with an icy glare

MARY ANN
You think this is funny

SARAH
I just cant believe you want to castrate
aman for indecent exposure

THERESA
My brother used to expose himself when
we were teenagers Hed do it in my —
bedroom or in the backseat of the car
even at the dinner table He always
figured out a way to do it so that no one
could see what he was up to but me

MARY ANN
(disgusted)
Didnt you tell anyone

THERESA
(puzzied
No I didn’t want to get him in trouble
It didn’t stop until he went away to
college

SARAB
He should have been castrated

MARY ANN

(snapping)
It’s not the same thing He wasn’t doing
it to strangers
Cheryl’s head swivels as if pulled by a magnet

CHERYL
Oh My God look After all this time
There he is Two days in a row

Brad and Aaron have arrived at the playground gate

SARAH
Maybe he just needed a vacation

MARY ANN
(suspicious)
Prom what
THERESA

From being the Prom King

19-
-li-

CHERYL
its a dirty ie
(chuckling)
But someone’s got to do it

As Brad and Aaron pass the women on their way over to the far swing-
set the trio go completely silent — pretending not to notice

Sarah watches them amused

SARAH
What’s he do for a living
The others look nervous and ignore the question
MARY ANN
(uncomfortable)
Weve never actually spoken to him
SARAH
Youre kidding right
THERESA
We don’t even know his name
SARAH
Really I thought you said he was a
regular here
THERESA
It was awkward

CHERYL
He made us nervous You had to think
about what you were going to wear in the
morning Put on makeup It was
exhausting

Lucy leaves her position at the top of the SLIDE and wanders over to
the SWING-SET right next to where Brad pushes Aaron She calls to her
mother
LUCY
Mommy Push me
SARAH
Alright I’1i be right there

Sarah smiles at the women wondering how theyll react to her impending
proximity to “The Prom King” As she rises to go Theresa calls out

weit THERESA (0C
ts

Sarah stops

SARAH
What

Theresa holds up her WALLET smirking like a schoolgirl

THERESA
Five bucks if you get his phone number

SWING SET MOMENTS LATER

Aaron observes Lucy with a certain amount of skepticism as she swings in
near-unison beside him He turns to Sarah his expression unexpectedly
serious

AARON
How old is she

SARAH

(coaxing)
Lucy honey Tell the nice boy how old
you are

AARON
Im three

He jabs the corresponding fingers into the air
AARON

My grandmother lives in New Jersey She
doesnt have a swim pool

SARAH
to the boy
Do you like to swim
AARON
I don’t like sharks They eat you up
BRAD
Don’t listen to him We go to the town
pool almost every day

Brad smiles at Sarah

BRAD
I’m Brad by the way
She smiles back

SARAR
Sarah

BRAD
You guys come here a lot

SARAH
Only for the last few weeks We used to
go to the one over on Harris with the
big wood things and the slide across

BRAD
Yeah we actually rent a place right around
the corner from there on Ashforth But that
ice cream truck never leaves what a
nightmare
—13-

SARAE
Tell me about it

BRAD
--you know youre the first person here
whos ever talked to me

SARAH
You make them nervous

BRAD
Oh right I guess they don’t see too
many fathers here during the weekdays

Phey keep pushing the children

BRAD
You don’t have to be polite Go ahead and ask

SARAH

BRAD
What the person who wears the pants in
the family does for a living

SARA
Alright what does your wife do
BRAD
She makes documentaries
SARAH
Oh wow Like Michael Moore

SARAE
Oh well I think it’s admirable that
oure here There‘s no reason men can’t
e primary caregivers

BRAD
I finished law school two years ago But
T can’t seem to pass the bar exam Failed
it twice now

SARAE
Maybe you just don’t want to be a lawyer
Brad looks momentarily startled by this suggestion

BRAD
Ill take the test one more time If I
mess up now I’m just going to have to
find something else to do with my life

They go back to their swinging
14—

VOICE

Sarah was shocked by how Brad delivered
this confession with no apparent sense
of being in the least bit embarrassed by
his failure Most men werent like this
Her husband Richard certainly wasn’t
She wondered if Brad was always this
forthcoming If anything he seemed a
little lonely all too ready to open his
heart at the slightest sign of interest
like a lot of young mothers she knew

Sarah breaks the silence
SARA
T couldnt heip noticing your stroller
Do you have another child
BRAD
Just Aaron We got that at a yard sale

The extra seat comes in handy for the
bear

SARAH
Lucy refuses to be put into a stroller
or a car seat We have to walk everywhere
It takes us half an hour to go three
blocks unless I carry her
Daddy finish

BRAD
You sure We just got here

BRRON

Daaady I finish right now

BRAD
Alright One two three
He stops the swing leaves Aaron and attends to the bear He pulls
it out of the swing and straps it into the stroller Then comes back
or Aaron

Sarah watches in silence as he cups Aaron by the armpits and attempts
to lift him out of the swing

The boy’s foot gets caught in one of the apertures and she hurries
ever to free it before Brad has a chance to ask for assistance

BRAD
Thanks

No probien

Sarah watches as Brad buckles Aaron into the stroller
YOICE
It was then while watching Brad kneel
down at his son’s feet that Sarah found
herself gripped by an unexpected pang of
sadness

She looks toward the opposite end of the playground The women
leaning forward on their bench completely riveted

VOICE
Don’t go she thought Don’t leave me
here with the others

Brad stands and turns toward her as if he’d read her mind
BRAD

(curious smile)
Well it was nice talking to you

SARAH
Yeah you too
He starts to leave
SARAH
(suddenly)

Hey

Brad stops and looks at her confused

BRAD
Yes
SARAH
(conspiratorial)
Come here
BRAD
What

Ss
Justcome here

He does as he’s told

SARAH
You see those women over there
He glances in the direction of the PICNIC TABLE All of the women
suddenly look in the other direction
SARAH
Yeah Don’t look Don’t look You know
what they call you

He takes a small step toward Sarah intrigued

BRAD
What

15—

SARAB
The Prom King

BRAD
Ouch Thats awful

SARAH

They mean it as a compliment Youre a
big character in their fantasy lives

BRAD
Wow

SARAH
One of them bet me five dollars I
couldn’t get your phone number

BRAD

(smiling)

Five bucks huh

SARAH
Yep

Brad shoots another look at the women
BRAD
(teasing)
Could we split it fifty-fifty
SARAH coe
(right back at him)
It could be arranged
A moment
SARAH
Doesn’t have to be your real number
BRAD
Well in that case sure
Brad pats himself down looking for a pen Nothing

BRAD
You got a pen

Sarah doesn’t She glances toward the table where her diaper bag is
She doesn’t want to go there She looks back to hin
SARAR
Oh shit No no I don’t

BRAD
Well maybe next time

He turns to go but Sarah reaches out and grabs his arm

No listen waitjust wait
-lj-

He’s waiting She’s thinking Then —
SARAH
You know what would really be funny
BRAD
What

SARAH
-if you gave me a hug

BRAD
(smiles)
You think
SARAH
«yeah

Brad grins He’s game

BRAD
Well alright come here
Brad opens his arms and Sarah steps into them They hug

MARY ANN (0C)
Oh My God

Mary Anns reaction makes them both start to giggle
SARAR
(whispers)
You wanna really freak them out
Brad looks at her a moment Then —

BRAD
-»-Yeah

He leans down and gives her a tentative kiss half-serious as if
theyre acting in a play

A COLLECTIVE GASP travels from the ladies at the picnic table to our
couple Followed by a panicky chorus call from the mothers summoning
their children from the play structure
Brad and Sarah part But they somehow can’t take their eyes off each
other

SARAH

(glancing at the exodus
I think that worked

Both of them are blushing

pnicky mothers)
-yean I Oe Ene nk so

BRAD
Well it was nice meeting you
SARAR
--yep mom ham

He sets off without another word Sarah watches his broad back recede
as he pushes the stroller past the other mothers and out of the park

gates

She turns to Lucy sitting motionless in the swing watching the same
sight as her mother her feet kicking dreamily in the air

SARAH
Lets go

She gathers Lucy from the swing and carries her like a piece of
oversized luggage back to the bench to retrieve her things Her face
burning with pride and with shame

Cheryl and Theresa huddle with their children staring at Sarah in
comp ete bewilderment Flanked by Troy and Isabelle Mary Ann looks
urious

MARY ANN
Im sure your daughter found that very
educational

Sarah reaches down for the diaper bag and turns to go

SARAH
His names Brad He’s a lawyer And he’s
really very nice

Sarah picks up Lucy and heads home
EXT FIELD — DAY

Sarah sits under a tree trying her level best to read Margaret
Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale After a moment she puts it down and
gazes off distracted

VOICE
For the past few days Sarah hadnt
been able to concentrate on anything
but the Prom Kingand the curious
thing that had happened between them
on the playground

She glances the other direction where some distance away —

LUCY squats on the grass her back to Sarah playing alone and
talking to herself

Sarah looks away from the child and away into the expanse

VOICE
She didn’t feel shame or guilt only a
sense of profound disorientation as if
she had been kidnapped by aliens and
then released unharmed a few hours
later

Mother and child under the shade of the tree In the distance an
amphitheater of sorts a white wing which resembles a flying saucer
mo

VOICE
As he had so often in recent days

BRAD sits on his usual bench under the beech tree But instead of
watching the skateboarders he closes his eyes We PUSH IN OW his
dreamy face

VOICE
Brad mentally re-enacted the kiss by
the swingset He still couldn’t believe
it had really happened and with all
those women and children watching

WE SEE AARON in his stroller at the playground that day looking up
toward Brad and Sarah
VOICE
Aaron had been particularly curious about
what hed seen

IN BRADS LIVING ROOM he situates a BLOW-UP PUNCHING CLOWN Aaron
stands opposite his father

BARON
Why you hugging that lady
BRAD
Well see now that’s what I’m trying to
show you here with Bozo
Brad kneels down in front of the clown
BRAD
Sometimes it’s a game grown-ups play when
their friends
He spreads his arms in an exaggerated way

BRAD
See

Brad mechanically embraces the clown

BRAD
fi I’m your friend

The boy’s face wears dubious look

VOICE
Aaron was skeptical

VOICE
They returned to the playground the
foliowing morning

VOICE
-Dut no one was there

BRAD AND AARON at the TOWN POOL Brad scans the other FACES

VOICE
Sarah hadn’t shown up at the town pool
either though Brad remembered telling
her that he and Aaron could be found
there most afternoons It didn’t seem to
matter that Sarah wasn’t his type ae
« wasn’t even that pretty at least not
compared to Kathy

IDEALIZED VISIONS of KATHY in the way the voice describes

VOICE
ewho had long legs and lustrous hair
and perfect breasts

BRAD continues his daydreaming
VOICE
Sarah was short and boyish and had
eyebrows that were thicker than Brad
thought necessary
All that is described above is seen
VOICE
But even so she’d walked into his arms
that day as if she was fulfilling a
secret wish he hadn’t remembered making

MAN (0C)
Hey pervert

Brad‘s eyes open startled awake from his fantasy

MAN (0C)
Yeah you pervert

Brad cringes as he looks toward —
A VAN-parked by the curb directly across from him A man gestures
toward Brad from the vehicles dark cab
MAN
Like little boys do you

The teasing note in the Mans voice is clearer now and Brad drops his
guard and Squints into the van

Meet LARRY HEDGES 30 He wears a T-SHIRT with the word GUARDIANS
across the chest and GRAY ATHLETIC SHORTS He leans across the
passenger seat into the street-light and grins at Brad

BRAD

BRAD

Larry laughs He pops the lock on the passenger side

TARRY
Get in I got a better idea
Brad hesitates

LARRY
C’mon cmon cmon

Brad does as he is told

INTEXT LARRY’S VAN NIGHT

As Brad climbs in Larry clears off the passenger seat He tosses a
FOOTBALL and a pair of BINOCULARS into the back and lifts up a fat
stack of BLUE PAPER

LARRY
You mind

He drops the stack onto Brad’s lap

LARRY
I’m trying to keep them nice
Brad glances at the top sheet It’s the same flyer we’ve seen
throughout the story His eyes stray to the bottom of the page
PAID FOR BY THE COMMITTEE OF CONCERNED PARENTS
BRAD

LARRY

Zi
BRAD

(somewhat impressed)

Howd you find out about this creep

LARRY
There’s a web site The states required

sex Offenders Dont you check it

BRAD

(covering)
Not on a regular basis

Larry’s expression darkens
LARRY
They should just castrate the bastard and
be done with it
Brad nods as noncommittally as he can
A moment In the silence a familiar tune plays softly on the van’s
stereo system

BRAD
That’s Raffi right Big Beautiful
Planet

LARRY
Ah shit

Larry punches the eject

Larry stares at Brad a lingering appraisal

Brad tries to ignore how uncomfortable this feels

LARRY

BRAD
Push-ups crunches A little running

LARRY
(to himself)
The guys are gonna love this

BRAD
(a bit anxious)
What guys

EXT EAST WYNDAM BOMBERS’ FIELD — NIGHT

Brad and Larry head across a running track passing A SURLY-LOOKING
GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR This is BULLHORN BOB a fixture at the stadium

Brad pauses at the edge of the field a taut blue-green skin of
ARTIFICIAL TURF glowing with Caribbean purity beneath dazzling
lights Crisp WHITE LINES and NUMBERS run from one end zone to the
other Between the forty yard lines a half-dozen men toss FOOTBALLS
to each other and do warm-ups

BRAD
Wow This is something

LARRY
It’s pretty But it doesn’t have a lot
of give Like playing on cement

They approach midfield Some players strut up to greet them TOMMY
CORRENTI a drill-sergeant of a man with an off-kilter nose and A
COMICALLY NASAL VOICE DEWAYNE ROGERS a squat bald African-
American man BART WILLIAMS a no-neck white y with thinning hair
wearing a KNEE BRACE RICHIE MURPHY a powerful man with red hair
and PETE OLAFFSON a scrawny man whose uniform is intentionally one
size too small

Larry steps away from Brad and button-holes DeWayne corralling him
away from the others ‘

LARRY
Hey DeWayne I really need to talk to
you about the committee It’d mean a lot
to have your support on this thing

DEWAYNE

Larry makes a piercing whistle The guys all turn toward him

LARRY
Bring it in Cmon hustle it up
The men all gather around Larry
LARRY
Guys I want you all to meet our new
quarterback

Brad waited for his good sense to kick

He takes in his surroundings and the faces of the other men

his world had cracked open to reveal a
thrilling new possibility

His face fills with certainty

Alright Just let me warm up a little

around you will notice a kind of dead beauty to the place All
dressed up and no place to go

Even so Sarah was ambivalent about the house
that she occupied She wasn’t involved with

the furnishings were left-overs from his first
marriage

The child retreats Sarah returns to her studies

VOICE
From the moment Lucy was born Sarah had
refused to hire someone for child care
She wasn’t exactly sure why she had taken
this stance The truth was she spent most
afternoons marking time

Sarah glances impatiently at her watch
She spots a toy left behind by Lucy She rises from the writin
table bends down to pick up the item moves to the doorway an
places it on a Sside-table outside the room She steps back into her
study and closes the door

With the flair of a magician Jean produces a TINY STUFFED DOG from

Sarah sits at her writing table her impatience growing by the second
LUCY and JEAN play in the next room at the kitchen table Sarah extends
her leg and gently closes the door She turns and We MOVE IN on her
annoyed face -

VOICE
Sarah was beginning to get angry Her
evening fitness walk was the one thing
she looked forward to all day and
Richard knew this She didn’t care how
busy he was it was a simple matter of

equity

A SILVER-FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Sarah and Lucy rests on a desk

A distinguished looking MAN in his mid-forties sits behind the desk
focusing on the COMPUTER SCREEN in front of him

YOICE
If there was one thing life had taught
Richard it was that it was ridiculous to
be at war with your own desires

RICHARD opens his desk drawer and removes a small rectangular UPS
shipping box

VOICE
He could easily imagine what people would
say if they could see him now
With trembling hands he breaks the seal on the box and withdraws a
MANILA ENVELOPE decorated with STICKERS RED HEARTS and STARS

YOICE
-exactly the same thing theyd say if
someone had told them that Ray

Richard glances at A BOX that appears over HIS RIGHT SHOULDER In it
- RAY aman in his 30s dressed in sweats underhands a ball to his
son who swings for a hit

VOICE
»from next door was a transvestite

Blone now in Ray’s imagined bedroom he gazes into a MIRROR applying LIP-
STICK

VOICE
-»or that Ted from work had anonymous
gay sex at highway rest stops

Richard glances at A NEW BOX that appears over HIS LEFT SHOULDER In
it — another man TED stands at a bank of URINALS he gives a side-
long glance to a SKINNY MAN using the next one over

As Richard looks back down at the envelope in his hands the BOXES

disappear Richard takes out a LETTER OPENER and slices through the

packing tape on the envelope
VOICE
But we want what we want Richard
thought and there’s not much we can do
about it

Before removing the contents of the envelope Richard takes the

INT RICHARDS PLACE OF BUSINESS — DAY ELEVEN MONTHS AGO

VOICE
He had stumbled on the site eleven months
ago while doing research for a
consulting firm

A SQUARE ROOM with dozens of MANNED CUBICLES through the maze on the
other side of the place is -

A 600 square-foot office with a window where —

RICHARD sits at his desk his attention focused on his FLAT-SCREEN

yOIcE
His office door was wide open
Richard glances up from the monitor furtively
He takes a breath and his eyes go back to the monitor

His HAND holding the MOUSE hovers with anticipation
33

VOICE
But he clicked on the link anyway
ON the MONITOR is the HOMEPAGE of SLUTTY KAY a BLONDE WOMAN in her
thirties There’s something graphically homegrown about the design
It looks authentic and not put together by a consortium in Glendale
In large friendly quotes it says “actively pursuing a swinging
lifestyle and my God-given sexuality”
His hand moves the mouse The cursor clicks on Read More About Me A
long QandA appears next to a new image of Kay bending over a table
She wears a SHORT TARTAN SKIRT with NO PANTIES
VOICE
He was deeply engrossed in his discovery
when Ted knocked on his door

TED Richard’s imagined REST STOP CRUISER stands in the doorway

VOICE
»etaking orders for a lunch run

Richard looks up

VOICE
Casually but with great haste
Richard’s hand invisibly moves his mouse
VOICE
Richard banished Slutty Kay from his
screen
Kays homepage collapses the monitor now shows a spread sheet of
another kind
VOICE
»-told Ted that he’d like a Chicken
Caesar
Ted nods and departs
VOICE
»--and re-entered the flow of an ordinary
day
Richard refers to some papers and inputs data into his machine
VOICE
-»-it wasn’t until several months later
that Richard gave the slightest thought
to the site he had stumbled upon
INT RICHARD’S PLACE OF BUSINESS — NICHT — SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
The overhead lights are off for the night The only illumination in
the place emanating from an office on the other side of the room
where —

RICHARD sits at his desk shuffling papers pretending to be busy A
middle-aged SECRETARY pokes her head into the room
SECRETARY
De you need me for anything else

RICHARD
No why don’t you head home I’m gonna
catch up on some e-mail

SECRETARY
Well don’t stay too late Your dinner1ll
get cold

Richard smiles and waves goodbye He lets a couple of seconds pass
then gets up and locks his office door

Richard returns to his desk his attention now refocused on his flat-
screen

VOICE
Lately Slutty Kay had become a problem

The cursor highlights a BOOKMARK in his preferences entitled —
Slutty Kay positions and implements

VOICE
He thought about her far too often and
spent hours studying the thousands of
photographs available to him

Richard’s CURSOR flies across the SCREEN and launches his BROWSER

Kay appears in various positions outfits and as the bookmark title
indicated utilizing all kinds of implements

VOICE
Some of Kays practices struck him as
bizarre even off-putting She had a
thing about kitchen utensils spatulas
barbecue forks and dressing up like a
little girl and playing with balloons
But who was Richard to judge

He pulls a box of KLEENEX from the BOTTOM DRAWER and licks his lips
ats eyes dreamy and hungry He pulls down his trousers and gets down
to business

VOICE
Though as close as Richard sometimes
felt to Slutty Kay — as much as he
believed that he knew her

Richard keeps yanking a desperate impatience on his face
VOICE
-- he could never get past the
uncomfortable fact that she existed for
him solely as a digital image

He looks down at his lap Things don’t seem to be going well

INT SARAHS HOUSE UPSTAIRS OFFICE — BACK TO PRESENT — MAGIC

CLOSE ON Richard’s HANDS as they remove the contents of the HEART-
COVERED MANILA ENVELOPE three POLAROIDS of SLUTTY KAY wearing a
POLKA DOT THONG in various poses Each of them bear the greeting
scrawled in black sharpie Hi Richard

VOICE
The panties were an attempt to solve this
problem

His HANDS reach back in and pull out the actual THONG in the photos
He raises it a couple of inches from his face tentatively giving it
his nasal appraisal

VOICE
Maybe a sniff or two would hurry things
along so he could get back downstairs to
his real life

He reaches down with his other hand and jerks off

VOICE
- where his wife and daughter were
waiting for him their impatience
increasing by the minute

SARAH stands at the bottom of the stairway staring up Her patience
at an end She hesitates just a moment before making the long climb
Unaware that she is about to play her own version of Aaron’s Train
Wreck

She arrives outside the office door and gives a tentative knock
No answer She reaches down and turns the knob The door swings open
to -

RICHARD jerking He now wears the polka dot thong like a gas mask
over his mouth and nose Inhaling its scent with gusto

SARAH peers inside Her expression wavering between revulsion and
amazement Richard is oblivious

SARAH
Ahen

Richard whips his head around the thong still pressed over the lower
half of his face He scrambles to hide the evidence

SARAH
Is this going to take much longer I’d
really like to go for my walk

pulling the thong off his face)
You could have knocked

SARAH
I did

JEAN
Well that’s an interesting perspective

SARAH
Excuse me Jean Someone’s at my door

Sarah hurries off leaving Jean behind in the street

THERESA from the playground sits on Sarah’s front steps smoking a
cigarette She smiles stiffly as Sarah approaches

Sarah stops at the base of the steps

SARAH
(a bit flustered)
Well this is a surprise I haven’t seen

Sarah closes the door to Richards office moves over to the window

outside of one of the envelopes In a neat feminine cursive is
scrawled “Brad Please look this over” His hands obey and pull out
an itemized report that has multiple items highlighted Sports
illustrated Men‘s Fitness and Mothering Magazine In the margins
the same cursive asks “Do you really need these” The phone rings
and Brad answers it

She’s already hung up Brad hangs up closes his eyes and steels
himself He looks utterly defeated

AN UNTOUCHED MUG OF TEA on the writing table in front of her Sarah
sits there with a thousand mile stare on her face Finally she picks
up her notebook and book of essays on Feminist Criticism and tries
to get interested It’s no use She sets them down abruptly and
moves over to —

A SIDE-TABLE stacked with periodicals She rifles through and
discards Ad Busters Mother Jones The Utne Reader The Paris
Review before finding the object of her desire the latest
catalogue from J-CREW

She moves to an old HIGH-BACK CHAIR with her prize and starts
browsing the pages She takes a huge gulp of tea her left hand
absently reaches for the television remote and turns on the set

An infomercial for Nature-Bra preaches “the iors of perky breasts”
Sarah focuses on a J-CREW Model clad in a RED ONE PIERCE BATHING
SUIT as the seductive spokeswoman for Nature-Bra points out the
possible benefits of using this product post breast feeding” Sarah
turns her attention from the catalogue to the screen just in time
to “learn how to order”

An enormous rectangle of water framed by a CONCRETE WALKWAY set at
the bottom of a grassy hill

A SLY SMILE OF RECOGNITION passes across Sarah’s face
In the middle-distance BRAD AND AARON SIT SHADED BY A TREE

Sarah flashes her ID at a BORED-LOOKING TEENAGER reading a Stephen
King novel The kid waves them in Sarah takes Lucy straight to

THE WADING POOL She attaches a pair of INFLATABLE WATER-WINGS to
Lucys arms and sits her on the edge of the pool She sneaks a
glance up the hill toward Brad and Aaron’s tree hoping to catch a
certain someone’s eye She does

BRAD shirtless sits on a beach towel in a patch of shade He looks
in her direction Then looks away quickly
EG

SARAH sets LUCY into the WADING POOL and makes a show of playing
with her daughter throwing the occasional glance up the hill to make
sure he’s still there -
‘He is pretending to read a magazine Aaron in his JESTER’S CAP
stages collisions with TOY TRUCKS But the boy grows bored and
toddles over to his father pulling on Brad’s arm
AARON

Brad‘s not sure he’s ready for that

BRAD

IN THE WADING POOL Sarah watches Lucy but she’s clearly distracted
She steals another look

LUCY
Mommy I havta to go pee pee
SARAH
Just go in the pool
Lucy shakes her head no

SARAH
Really Okay c‘mon
She grabs Lucy and they head to the LADIESS LOCKER ROOM

UNDER THE TREE Brad sees his chance to avoid an encounter and
satisfy Aaron at the same time He stands picks up his son and
heads down the hill toward the pool

IN THE WADING POOL Brad and Aaron roughhouse and play Brad is more
engaged with his child but like Sarah he can’t help wishing he had
eyes in the back of his head He keeps scanning the area on the
lookout for her His eyes fixate on the LADIESS LOCKER ROOM DOOR
Women and children come and go but no Sarah or Lucy

Finally Brad begins to relax allowing himself to become completely
absorbed in play

Brad and Aaron squint into the sun as they trudge up the hill toward
their tree It’s not until they have almost reached the shady place
that they discover —
SARAH and LUCY spread out on towels right next to their own

Sarah devours him with her eyes

Oh Jesus 5

At first no one else seems to notice his presence in the water
BEACH BALLS float through the air Kids keep CANNONBALLING and BELLY-
FLOPPING off the diving board

But then not far from Brad and Sarah on the hill an EXTREMELY
AGITATED WOMAN stands up and shouts

AGITATED WOMAN
Jimmy Jimmy Mancino Out of the pool
this instant

A SKINNY TEN-YEAR-OLD starts paddling uncertainly toward the edge of
the pool

AGITATED WOMAN
Jimmy now

ANOTHER ADULT VOICE rings out followed by a PARENTAL CHORUS
4 6—

ADULT VOICE
Randall Juliette You too

PARENTAL CHORUS

Grace Pabloi Ruby Tyler Max Rebecca

Lilly Zoe
The SHALLOW END empties first ANXIOUS MOTHERS wading out with
FRIGHTENED TODDLERS in their arms Before long the OLDER KIDS are
climbing out too standing in sullen confusion on the walkway
aul over the hillside adults are whipping out MOBILE PHONES dialing
UNDERWATER - Ronnie McGorvey plunges toward the bottom of the deep
end with the heavy grace of a seal He rises slowly -
Breaking the SURFACE to find himself alone in the pool
Ronnie’s EYES dart around inside his MASK absorbing the situation

He ducks BACK UNDER cutting through the water moving his arms in
wide lazy circles He looks peaceful unhurried

He FLOATS on his BACK for a while his pale belly rising out of the
water like a deserted island

MINUTES LATER
TWO COPS enter the pool area and approach McGorvey Aaron and Lucy
have taken notice too
LUCY

Why the police is here

Sarah checks with Brad uncertain
SARAH

There’s a man in the pool that didn’t buy

a ticket to get in and the police are

asking him to leave
The cops speak to McGorvey The exchange seems polite almost

friendly After a moment one cop reaches down and gives him a hand
getting out of the water

AARON
What’s those On the feet

BRAD
Flippers They help you swim better

McGorvey grabs his towel and begins trudging toward the exit his
flippers Slapping wetly on the ground He stops to pull them off
then strips off the mask turning toward the hillside He spreads his
arms wide addressing the public in a loud voice

NCGORVEY
I was only trying to cool off
EXT TOWN POOL — LATER

It seems like the whole town has crowded into the pool the DECENT
PEOPLE OF Bast Wyndam reclaiming it for their own

The COLLECTIVE FUNK has broken Adults get into giggly splashing
fights Everybody tries to keep a beach ball aloft

THE SUN BEGINS TO DISAPPEAR BEHIND A CLOUD

The DISTANT RUMBLE of THUNDER The sky goes DARK It begins to SHOWER

It seems like good fun until the LIGHTNING FLASH A LIFEGUARD speaks
through a LOUDSPEAKER

LIFEGUARD (0C
Clear the pool please

The rain intensifies as Sarah and Brad gather their things

A SAVAGE CRACK OF THUNDER SOUNDS Lucy whimpers and latches onto
Sarahs leg Sarah lifts her up

SARAH
We better get going

BRAD
You’re gonna carry her

SARAH
Itll be faster

BRAD
That’s crazy Put her in the stroller

Sarah glances at the stroller BIG BEAR stares back

SARAH
She won’t do the stroller

BRAD
Hey Lucy Want a ride

Lucy unlatches from Sarah’s leg and runs right into Brad‘s arms and
he sets her up in the thing

Sarah is both impressed and envious
SARAH
But it’s out of your way

BRAD
We don’t mind do we Aaron
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING

SARAH
Okay Then run quick
EXT SARAHS STREET — LATER

Brad pushes the double stroller at a fast clip Sarah carrying Big
Bear in her arms leads him toward her house

EXT SARAH’S HOUSE (SUN ROOM) — SAME

Sarah kneels down to unbuckle Lucy Both kids SLEEP LIKE ANGELS
Lucy’s head lolling on Aaron’s shoulder

Sarah hesitates uncertain whether to invite Brad in This AWKWARD
MOMENT is interrupted by a CLOSE LIGHTNING FLASR

SARAH
You better come in I can’t let you walk
home in this
INT SARAH’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM STAIRS — SAME
The two enter with the kids in tow Sarah heads straight in Brad a
few paces behind takes in the place Expensive tasteful and a
couple of notches up the food chain from what he is used to Sarah
heads upstairs carrying Lucy
SARAH
We can lie them down in Lucy’s room

BRAD

He follows her up the stairway

This is amazing She never naps
BRAD
whispers)
Aaron’1l be out for the next two hours
Ill have to get him out of that
nightgown before he wakes up or he’ll
never forgive me

Sarah looks at him and smiles

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY — MOMENTS LATER

Brad waits on the stairs as Sarah secures the BABY GATE

BOTTOM OF STAIRSLIVINGROOM - SAME

Sarah and Brad head down the final stairs and into the living room

The safety of the public arena removed makes keeping each other’s
company clumsy

BRAD
Nice place

SARAH
You think so

BRAD
Yeah

SARAH
Richard does alright for himself
The comment ig not meant to intimidate but it does

BRAD
What’s he do again

SARAH
Lies

They stand there staring at each other Puddles forming at their
eet

SARAH
Um Please have a seat Make yourself at
home

Brad laughs and pulls at his soaked clothing

BRAD
I better not I11 ruin your furniture

SARAH
(nervous)
Right I’1l just put the children’s
things in the dryer and get us some
towels

She heads out of the room quickly leaving Brad alone

He looks off the main entry way to a succession of small rooms an
open door leads to the first room situated behind a back staircase
clearly what was at one time quarters for a maid He steps inside
Nothing much to see On the other side of the room is another door
sit htly ajar He wanders in that direction and opens the door
inding —

SARAHS STUDY

He steps into the room and takes a quick inventory of the place her
place

He moves toward her old high-back and pushes a finger into one of
the many holes in its torn fabric

One of SARAHS SCARVES is draped across the top of the chair He
places his palm underneath the garment — the material cascading over
nis hand

At the base of a VASE full of FRESH FLOWERS lie Sarah’s READING
GLASSES
—-50-

The tips of his fingers giide across her writing table past Theresa
Raquin to a book of English Love Sonnets The book opens easily
marked by an as yet not fully ary rose pressed against an oft read

iece Sonnet 147 by William Shakespeare Specific lines appear to
have been recently underlined

My Love is as a fever The uncertain sickly appetite to please
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept Past cure am I

He turns the page to find a tucked-in SNAP-SHOT of BRAD AARON and
LUCY at the town pool

The book snaps shut

He puts it back down on the table like it may burn his hand
His face a mess of conflicting emotions

LAUNDRY ROOM - SAME

Sarah empties bedding and towels from a FRONT LOADER into an empty
laundry basket She grabs the children’s wet things throws them into
the dryer and starts the cycle She moves the basket to a folding
table on the other side of the small basement room pulls out two
towels and begins folding them into thirds

Slowly A SHADOW begins to grow across her back —
Brad’s shoulder and head appear

ary continues folding Oblivious to everything but the sound of the
er

He raises his hand about to place it on her arm when suddenly she
turns coming face-to-face with him Startled she gasps

She looks genuinely frightened What is he doing down here

The two of them just stare at each other — both appear unable to move
Finally she lifts up the two towels she has folded and offers one to
him there is something oddly formal about her gesture

He takes the towel from her hand and drops it to the floor She
somewhat timidly drops the other one

He pulls her into him and begins to kiss her gentle then forceful

Her eyes dart all over the place Then instinct kick in and she
surrenders to the moment The kiss becomes completely electrifying
the kind of kiss that would make perfect sense outside a dorm room at
two in the morning Their hands find each other for the first time
all bets are off — the play is real

LAUNDRY ROOM — MOMENTS LATER

SQUAUK — The dryer announces that it has reached the end of its
cycle However the silence is short-lived Grateful moans accompany
the view of Sarah perched on the edge of a STONE SOAP SINK gripping

Brad’s backside as he thrusts himself into her

Brad picks up the pace They’ve reached a level of near-frenzy when
Brad SUDDENLY STOPS
BRAD
Do you feel guilty about this

Sarah thinks this over
S
No I don’t

BRAD
I do I feel really bad
Sarah grimaces steeling herself for disappointment But the
deliberate motion of Brad’s body betray his words putting her
mind at ease and her body on high alert She begins to vocalize

uncontrollably The laundry room door is slightly open and she
looks toward the -

by the early evening sun Several women chat aniably around a coffee
table — ONE OF THE WOMEN turns her head toward the foyer Sarah’s
expression tightens as if in sudden pain

INT TOWNHOUSE LIVINGROOM NIGHT
CLOSE ON Mary Ann’s face She looks offended

MARY ANN
Did anybody like this book
Because I really just hated it

PULL BACK to reveal the BOOK GROUP four OLDER WOMEN plus two LITTLE
SISTERS Sarah and Mary Ann They sit around a coffee table brimming
with wine cheese fruit and crackers

MARY ANN
It’s so depressing She cheats on her
husband with two different guys wastes
all his money then kills herself with rat
poison Do I really need to read this

The book group is dismayed by this blunt declaration
LAUREL a youthful sixty year-old ventures a response
LAUREL
Well there is a lot of good descriptive
writing

The other ladies nod in vigorous agreement JOSEPHINE short and
plump takes the baton

JOSEPHINE
It’s supposed to be depressing It’s a
tragedy Madame Bovary’s undone by and
tragic flaw

Next we hear from BRIDGET a Gertrude Stein look-a-like

BRIDGET
Whats her flaw

JOSEPHINE
Blindness She cant see that the men are
just using her

JEAN
She just wants a little romance in her
life You can’t blame her for that

BRIDGET
It’s about womens choices Back then a
woman didn’t have a lot of choices You
could be a nun or a wife That’s all
there was

JOSEPHINE
Or a prostitute

Mary Ann fixes her gaze pointedly on Sarah

MARY ANN
She had a choice She had a choice not to
cheat on her husband

BRIDGET
Usually it’s the man who cheats I found
it refreshing to read about a woman
reclaiming her sexuality

MARY ANN
Reclaiming her sexuality Is that a nice
way of saying she’s a slut

JOSEPHINE
(miffed)
Madame Bovary is not a slut She’s one of
the great characters in Western
literature

An uncomfortable silence Then
LAUREL
I was a little puzzled by the some of
the sexual references
She opens her PAPERBACK annotated with POST-IT TAPE FLAGS
LAUREL
Like this one “He abandoned every last
shred of restraint and consideration He
turned her into something compliant
something corrupt”

Sarahs fallen into a kind of REVERIE

INT SARAHS ATTIC UTILITY ROOM — DAY

Sarah leans back on the mattress Brads head buried between her legs
ENT TOWNHOUSE LIVINGROOM — BACK TO SAME

LAUREL
Does anyone know what that means

MARY ANN
It means she’s a slut

LAUREL
Do you think he’s tying her up or

something
BRIDGET
(sotto)
Anal sex

Josephine nods looking uncomfortable

LAUREL
Did everyone get that but me

JEAN
Let’s set that aside for now
glancing at Sarah)
I’m really eager to hear what our other
little sister has to say

Jean raises her voice to get Sarah’s attention

JEAN
Im not sure if you know this but
Sarah’s got a PhD in English Lit

Sarah startles to the present picking up her cue

SARAH
Just a Master’s I never wrote my
dissertation

JEAN
Well you still have a lot more expertise
than the rest of us

Mary Ann rolis her eyes at this Then levels them at Sarah

Sarah smiles at Mary Ann as if the two of them are friends

SARAH

I think I understand your feelings about
this book I used to feel the same way
myself When I read it in grad school
Madame Bovary just seemed like a fool She
makes one foolish mistake after another
But when I read it this time I just fell
in love with her She‘’s trapped She can
either accept a life of misery or struggle
against it And she chooses to struggle

MARY ANN
Some struggle Jump in bed with every guy
who says helio

—69-
SARAH
She fails in the end But there’s
something beautiful and even heroic in
her rebellion My professors would kill
me for even thinking this but in her own
strange way Emma Bovary is a feminist

MARY ANN
Oh that’s nice So now cheating on your
husband makes you a feminist
SARAH
No It’s not the cheating It’s the
hunger The hunger for an alternative
And the refusal to accept a life of
unhappiness
The other ladies beam with approval and fascination
Mary Ann just shakes her head in disgust
MARY ANN
Maybe I didn’t understand the book She
just looked so pathetic

Sheila sits in front of her untouched meal concentrating hard as if
responding to a therapist

SHEILA

on my own Maybe it was a chemical
imbalance in my brain Every psychiatrist
I go to has a different opinion This one
guy Dr Farris said I must have been
sexually abused as a child When I told
him I wasn’t he just said I was
repressing the memory

Uncomfortable Ronnie changes direction

breathing rapidly increases

herself like a child on a ride that they are frightened of and hope

Everyone at the table is sort of waiting for the punch-line which
never arrives

Fortunately Brad tries to pick up the thread

BRAD
Well where were they from

Theyre a bunch of fat cats from

beside him to run interference but THE CONTROLLERS NUMBER 39 trips
up DEWAYNE leaving BRAD exposed to THE CONTROLLERS speed demon

screaming like a banshee flies between the two men and flattens THE
CONTROLLER

THE CONTROLLERS NUMBER 9 catches up to BRAD as he crosses the
fifteen yard-line BRAD slams on the brakes so drasticaily and
unexpectedly that his pursuer simply goes zooming past him with a
desolate cry of protest stumbling out of bounds and leaving BRAD
with a clear path to the end zone He spins on his heels and jogs
backwards into the end zone the ball raised triumphantly overhead
He spikes the ball his arms stretch wide his chest heaving

BRAD searches the STANDS for a witness to his glorious moment To his
surprise he sees

expecting Brad’s arrival

The SOUND of Ronnie sobbing is something she can no longer ignore
She turns to see —

Him hunched over on his swing crying uncontrollably
She pauses just a moment and then abandons Lucy’s swing and makes
her way over toward the other end of the park Stopping half-way
between the two structures
She wears a look of uncertainty on her face as she takes a couple of
hesitant steps in his direction
SARAR

He looks up at her in shock and then nods

THE STREET — She looks up and down in both directions Her face primal
as is her cry

A moment of terror that feels like an eternity
Finally about a hundred yards down the sidewalk she sees —

LUCY — The child stands at the base of a street light staring up at
the lamp as if hypnotized

INSECTS flutter in groups propelling themselves against the vapor
The child is utterly absorbed

Sarah’s face relaxes Though it wears the confusion of her sudden
outburst and momentary sense of loss

Get in the car-seat Get in the car-seat
The child does not fight her
Sarahs sense of urgency verges on panic She attempts to strap Lucy
into the seat but her shaking hands make a mess of it Finally she
just gives HF Sarah lurches forward and begins to sob uncontrollably
into her childs lap
Lucy looks down at her mother concerned
She lifts up her tiny hand and places it on top of Sarah’s head
gently stroking it back and forth
LUCY
Its okay mommy It’s okay
Lucy continues to caress Sarah’s head and this seems to calm her
Sarah raises her head BP and looks at her daughter Her eyes —
unwavering transfixed by the child’s face which greets her with
unconditional trust The two suspended together Nothing else exists
Lucy stares at her mother curiously

And it is in this moment that something essential in Sarah completely
transforms

SARAH
- oh Lucy

She leans forward and embraces her daughter

SARAH
Im sorry Im so sorry

Larry’s eyes go wide He looks up to Ronnie

LARRY

6 Ronnie smiles

He stands up and takes a couple of steps away from Larry He turns te
face him and drops his pants

From behind it is apparent he has wrapped his lower extremities
in rolls and rolls of cotton ganze like a paper towel the white
texture rapidly absorbing red

Larry stares at Ronnie’s crotch Horrified

RONNIE
- I’m I’m gonna be good now

Ronnie’s legs go rubbery and he begins to collapse

Before he hits the deck Larry catches Ronnie in his arms lifts him
off the ground and quickly carries him to the —

PARKING LOT

THE SIDE DOOR of the van opens and Larry carefully lays Ronnie down
in back and covers him with a blanket Larry now covered in blood

looks down at Ronnie worried
LARRY
Hold on Ronnie I’m not gonna let
anything happen to you You hold on
He closes the door and runs around to the driver’s side jumps in
starts the van pulls a portable GUMBALL light from under the dash
and places it onto the roof
VOICE
In his wildest dreams Larry would have
never imagined he’d once again be in this
position where precious minutes count

Larry’s van screeches out and tears down the road driving like
theres no tomorrow

EXT SARAH’S HOUSE ROOF LINE — NIGHT
Rise with the wind up over roof-tops and tree-tops — All of East
Wyndam laid out like a wood-cut in monochromatic relief

VOICE
-- and it had to start somewhere

A gust kicks up the trees begin to sing their branches dance
The distant sound of metal on metal ping ping ping

The view begins to slide back to where we started looking straight
down at the playground now empty and quiet save for the chain of a
single swing that stubbornly beats its tune into the structure
