INVASION

Black
Utter and silent A lifeless void AS IF DEEP UNDERWATER
Then

A strobe of light A mere flicker dashing across then gone
And another Building in tempo

A SOUND beckons from beyond growing progressively louder
coming progressively closer

It’s the sound of THUNDER The moment before a torrential
downpour

Louder and --

FADE IN

INT SUBWAY PASSENGER CAR - MORNING

Lights flicker as a train rumbles along the tracks a rusty
grey whale of the Los Angeles subway system

Glimpses outside the windows of the underground tunnels as
the cabin goes dark then the lights are back on the view
gone hidden behind the reflections inside

Early AM passengers still half asleep some fully Nursing
papers coffee resentment at their jobs their lives

A discarded SODA CAN lies on the floor at the front rocking
with the train’s movements It dislodges rolls down the
aisle past

A blue-collar Hispanic man wearing overalls and a cable
repair shirt -- HECTOR ROSALES 30s

Old scars on his knuckles cigarette burns tattoos Gang
markings

Pretending to read a newspaper a learning-to-read book
discretely hidden inside - “See Spot Run” Lips silently
moving with the words he reads

A man ready to reconcile a violent past to make something of
himself

The CAN rolls heading straight for

Expensive open-toed heels The feet lift at the last second
the can missing them belonging to a female LAWYER
On her cell phone closest thing she’s ever had to an
intimate relationship

LAWYER
(on cell)
Hello Hello can you hear me
(checks the signal)
Perfect Just perfect

Next to her JAMES LERNER Mid twenties sleeping off an all-
nighter

Stylish LA clothes smelling of alcohol lip stick stained
collar Bad hangover to look forward to The tops of his
hands are marked with stamps from various clubs

A guy with little conviction little foresight A guy just
looking to belong to fit in to be of use

His head lags over to her shoulder Disgusted she takes out
a tissue and nudges Lerner’s head to the other side off her
shoulder Purell’s her hands

The CAN curves rolling down the aisle

A TOURIST COUPLE late 40s The man in a busy Hawaiian shirt
the woman wearing “mom” jeans white tennis shoes

Studying the map of the colored train route on the wall --
Blue line red line brown line graffiti of male
genitalia

FEMALE TOURIST
Not like Nebraska

MALE TOURIST
No it sure isn’t

The CAN continues on curving and passing
VIC “SARGE” DORSEY late 40s Laconic A quietly commanding
presence Clutching a court order in his hand He has the

eyes of a widower or a war veteran of which he is both

A hard life lived He’s an aging lion but he still has some
bite left in him staring up at advertisements on the wall

Sprinklers spraying green lawns weight control milk
shakes water cooler sales

Focusing on one in particular a secluded beach unspoiled
ocean “Vacation in the Bahamas”

The can spins crosses the aisle coming to a stop against a
foot A hand picks it up belonging to

DAVID BEDFORD 37 sits with his coat on his lap Hes
wearing a tie He doesnt look very comfortable in it His
keen incisive eyes setting him apart

He holds the can between both his outstretched hands --
looking like the same subway car he now sits in then --
CRUNCH smashes the can like an accordion

A HOMELESS MAN sleeps across from him bag filled with cans
and bottles to recycle To make ends meet

A small old radio sits next to him his lone companion
playing the news - REPORTERS discussing Mars -- once a water
planet like Earth with life and oceans now dead lifeless
and inhabitable What happened to dry up its oceans

Bedford tosses the can into the man’s bag then rests his
temple back against the glass

A solitary figure with a wayward gaze The vibration of the
train lull his eyes closed

Beat
A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND

The passenger car shakes as a passing train barrels by two
feet from Davids window It passes in a few seconds

The car returns to a QUIET HUM

Bedford turns back to find a find a BOY five or six years
old peering at him from over the seat in front of him

BEDFORD
Hi
The Boy just gazes at him blankly then slinks back down
TRAIN ANNOUNCER

Next stop Hope Street Repeat
next stop Hope Street

Bedford looks across the seats to KELLY BEDFORD 15
rebellious ears plugged with her iPod eyes closed Feet
crossed and propped up on a suitcase

BEDFORD
Kelly

ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND
Bedford waits until the opposing train passes

BEDFORD
Kelly

She doesn’t hear him or doesn’t want to Bedford reaches
over pulls out a headphone from her ear

KELLY
Personal space David Remember

BEDFORD
Dad would do just fine

KELLY
Well What

BEDFORD
We’re the next stop

KELLY
Fine Whatever

BEDFORD
It’s a new school Same one I sub
at It’s not the end of the world

KELLY
How do you know

Kelly replaces her headphones then balances herself against
a headrest as the train rumbles She starts to the back of
the car suitcase in hand stopping at the doors She’1ll wait
there

David sits alone He looks like hes drowning but theres no
water

He looks out the window The station platform blurs as it
flies by

Their station
Beat
He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger

David turns Some of the other passengers react as they
realize the train missed their stop and is picking up speed

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified --

The train JOLTS ONCE
WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS FILL THE CABIN
The train goes faster

Lights flicker OFF losing power Passengers thrown into
DARKNESS

Only the light from out the windows illuminates them
sporadically Dark silhouettes painted against the windows

And then it happens

A HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN
BEGINS TO TAKE A CURVE

Bedford looks to the passengers across from him He sees the
ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as THEIR
SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE

SCREAMS AS THE TRAIN TILTS OFF THE TRACK --

To David it is all happening in slow motion his brain
unable to process it unable to react and --

A MASSIVE CONCUSSION -- THE TRAIN DERAILS --

-- METAL TEARING -- SCREECHING -- WINDOWS SHATTER -- RAINING
GLASS --

-- PASSENGERS THROWN FROM THEIR SEATS --

One hurtling down the aisle face SMACKING into the ceiling
with a sickly thud

Another is thrust from her seat the force sending her across
the way CRASHING through the window and out into the tunnel

A man holds on tight the train pitching and his head SLAMS
against the window then lolls He slides away off his seat

ANGLING THE FRONT OF THE TRAIN HITTING THE TUNNEL WALL --

-- METAL BENDING -- CRACKING -- CAVING IN LIKE AN ACCORDION
LIKE A METAL SODA CAN --

NOISE DEAFENING --
THE TRAIN CARS FROM BEHIND SMASH INTO THIS ONE --

STEEL SHEARS THE CAR IN HALF -- BOTH ENDS VIOLENTLY SKIDDING
AWAY AND --

CUT TO
INT SUBWAY TUNNEL

CLANKS of metal and concrete shifting debris Beams of
light

VOICES unintelligible shouts growing in intensity closer --

VOICE
We got another one
Feet running -- hands digging lifting clearing
VOICES
Get it off him Let’s go Watch it
watch it

Chunks of brick lifted twisted steel pushed away

VOICES
Careful

A hand wipes dirt away revealing a dirty cut face buried
in the rubble

David Bedford
Rosales hoists him out joined by ALEXANDRA “ALEX” RAWLY

late 20s hospital scrubs plain-looking without makeup hair
pulled back coming off a 48 hour shift Back on it now

ROSALES
Hold on homes We gettin’ you out

Rosales looks to his side where a shell-shocked Lerner
watches

ROSALES
Hey you give us a hand

Lerner looks around to see who Rosales is talking to
Realizes it’s him

ROSALES
Yeah you Get his legs

Lerner Alex and Rosales grab Bedford and lift him gingerly
out of the debris

ALEX
Over there Put him down there

Bedford is placed on the ground dazed incoherent He tries
to sit up but Rosales holds him down
BEDFORD
Kelly

ALEX
Watch this light Follow it

Alex runs through a standard set of tests

ALEX
How many fingers am I holding up

BEDFORD
Th-- Three

ALEX
Raise your left hand Good Now
tell me your name

BEDFORD
Bedford David Bedford

ALEX
He’s fine

And Alex is off with Rosales in tow Lerner goes back to
hiding

Bedford looks around with blurred eyes to get his bearings
His head is spinning pounding but his mind is on one thing

BEDFORD
Kelly Kelly

He stumbles up to his feet unsteady

Flares on the ground cast flickers of orange and eerie
shadows

Scattered construction gear scaffolding Warning signs on
walls “Caution Lead Paint” Permits for renovations

Beams and walls moaning and echoing pain-ridden SCREAMS

A nightmare

Bedford hurriedly moves through a make-shift triagemorgue
searching for his daughter among 30 passengers some dead or
close to it -- weeping covered immobile crying out in
pain wandering in dazes speckled in blood and burns -- Alex

going from person to person

The male tourist kneeled before his deceased wife praying
Another MAN ringing out his hands over and over as he stares
at the dead laid out

BEDFORD
My daughter have you see her
Short brown hair fifteen blue
shirt--
The man isn’t present enough to register Bedford

BEDFORD
Kelly

An INJURED MAN grabs onto Bedford’s ankle with a bloody hand
staring with desperate glossed-over eyes

INJURED MAN
Can you feel them I can’tI
can’t

Bedford follows the man’s body where it ends abruptly legs
shredded missing from half thigh down

Horrified he gets his ankle free and backs away trying
desperately to process

There’s no air only black choking smoke Twisted metal
crumbled brick and hot wires jungle the tunnels Unstable
walls GROAN AND CRUMBLE

Surviving passengers running about yelling chaotic

BEDFORD
Kelly

Bedford spots a body covered brown hair like Kelly’s
spilling out from underneath He melts He pulls back the
sheet bracing himself It’s not her

That’s when he looks up and sees it

THE ENTIRE SUBWAY TRAIN IS SMASHED BEFORE HIM PART OF IT
SEVERED IN TWO PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER

Bedford stops

From out of the bottom of part of the train is the boy’s leg
shoelace untied The rest of him is gone

KELLY (0S)
Dad Dad

He snaps out of it Eyes darting
BEDFORD
Kelly

KELLY (0S)
Here I’m over here

Bedford shoves through around wreckage and injuredand he
spots her

She turns sees him and breaks down Holding a bloodied towel
to her forehead She’s matted with dirt and grease and can
barely stand

Bedford is there to catch her

BEDFORD
Are you okay Are you hurt

She breaks down sobbing He clutches her close a father
protecting his daughter

BEDFORD
It’s okay I’1ll get us out of this
We’‘ll find a way

VOICES from nearby yelling -- a group of survivors standing
at a caved-in section of wall

BEDFORD
Come on

Bedford leads Kelly toward the voices

HAL 35 wearing the torn uniform of a subway controller
Rosales Lerner and a half dozen others

Sarge is off to the side near an emergency exit door pulling
on it but the frame is dented not going to open

LERNER
I knew it would happen like this
My first earthquake trapped
underground

HAL
You knew this would happen

LERNER
Well not this exactly but

ROSALES
It was louder up there before Now
nothing You they stopped looking
for us

Sarge slams into the exit door pounding on it YELLS out in
frustration Moves to another tunnel looking for a way out
Mice in a maze

ALEX
No way out

SARGE
Too much wreckage Forward tunnel’s
caved in Rest of the place isn’t
far behind

BEDFORD
Then we’ll get ourselves out

Heads turn to Bedford listening ten feet away

LERNER
What dig

BEDFORD
If that’s what it takes

ALEX
What about them

Nodding to the injured
HAL
You want to help those people Then

we all get out send a crew back

ROSALES
You can live with yourself

HAL
I’1l live And that’s enough

KELLY (0S)
Light I can see light up ahead

Kelly peering into the crashed train and --

INT TRAIN CAR

The others rush to Kelly’s side gawking through the mangled
interior of the train

True enough about sixty feet forward is a shaft of diffused
light

Daylightfrom outside

They wrestle with the decision Sarge doesn’t pause starts
through the train
MOMENTS LATER
They move through the dark train cars in single file

Residual sparks here and there but otherwise no electricity
SOUNDS of creaking metal and falling brick

The car is half its original length with the forward car
impaled through half of it jutting out at an angle

One by one the group steps up into the next train car Dead
bodies on the floor and seats hidden in the half light

HAL
Let’s go Watch your step

Moving through to a gap between the car they’re in and the
next

Forced to leap across the two foot expanse into the

NEXT TRAIN CAR

And gather The car is bent at the middle angling straight
up where it smashed through the ground above muted daylight

streaming through

A half dozen bodies are impaled around them thrown through
windows trapped in seats

One by one they climb up the interior of the train car
using the poles and seats to get up and out of the subway to
the surface

The light of day BLINDING

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING

The group emerges in a fenced in construction site for a new
subway entrance eyes shielded to bright sunlight as their
pupils adjust

They look around in awe and disbelief

IT’S SNOWING IN LOS ANGELES

A muted world of white flakes spiraling down from the sky
gathering lazily on the ground

Bedford holds out his hand lets a flake fall into it He
rubs it between his fingers It turns black
It isn’t snow

BEDFORD
Ash

Everything is covered in it grey white dust 6 inches deep

HAL
Hello
(hands megaphone mouth)
HELLLOOO

His voice echoes the stillness

There’s NO SOUND no cars no planes no birds only eerie
emptiness and deep silence beyond

KELLY
Where is everyone

Alex kneels to the ground brushing away soot to reveal a
suit jacket And shirt the tie still knotted around the
collar

She looks at the ground -- clothes are scattered around A
lot of clothes

CLOTHES WITHOUT BODIES

Sarge shoves past pushing open the fence doors and stops
dead staring out

The group slowly mechanically moves up next to him They
stare out mouths agape eyes agog

No words as they begin to comprehend the new nightmare
they’re in

THE CITY OF ANGELS

Has been raped A WORLD OF CLAUSTROPHOBIC SMOKE AND DUST
Achromatic with rusted obscurity

A TWENTY-FOOT RADIUS IS ALL THAT’S VISIBLE THE SURROUNDINGS
FALLING OFF INTO DIFFUSED ATMOSPHERE

Deserted debris laden Streets littered with hollow rusting
cars Trees are mangled appendages and grass is dried up
brown

Misshapen buildings are intact but lifeless shells covered
with mottled brown and white coated with black and grey
soot painted on thick and uneven

Something bad came through here and rotted the place from the
inside out

BEDFORD
My God

Sarge runs to an abandoned pickup truck Key in the ignition
He cranks it Nothing He runs to another car tries it
Dead He pounds on the wheel

They hear SOUNDS they’ve never heard before buildings
moaning and settling streets cracking and CRUNCHING
underneath their feet

Lerner inspects the ground as he walks Its littered with
cheap objects personal items

Something shiny catches his eye He picks it up wipes the
dust off

It’s a tooth with a metal filling

LERNER
Look a broken tooth

Hal moves over to him

HAL
Let me see it

Lerner hands it to him Hal flips it over in his hand

A realization as he looks down at the dust covered street He
bends and clears away thick dust

ALEX
Jesus

THE STREET -- COVERED IN TEETH and nails buried in dried
human hair

The survivors stand among the sea of human and animal
remains

The realization begins to settle in

THE CITY LIES AT THEIR FEET A HOLOCAUST

Kelly steps forward away from the others Visible through
the smoke ahead is a 40 story building becoming clear then
diffused again as smoke passes
There’s a dark shape up there moving
Smoke blowing clearing to see --
A WOMAN stands on the 35th story balcony
KELLY
HeyHey There’s someone up

there

Others move up to her to see The woman seems to be waving
Kelly waves back

Then the woman does something odd

She swings her feet around the balcony sitting on the rail --
And jumps

A second later the sickly THUD reaches them

HAL
What the fuck is going on

LERNER
We need to get outta herewe
gotta runsomething

No time to think as NOISES come from behind hidden in the
smoke

Getting louder -- Thumping -- Galloping
Our group steels themselves bracing for the coming unknown

MOTION -- SHAPES in the smoke -- diffused elongated -- a
STAMPEDE -- closer

Solidifying as they near --

A DOZEN PEOPLE race out of the fog stumbling some bloodied
running right at the group shoving them out of the way
Kelly is knocked down

They’re ghostly covered in dust and soot Frantic Yelling

PEOPLE
They’re coming Move Get the hell
outta here Oh God No Theyre
still here --

Running past -- getting the hell away from something

ALEX
We need help We have injured --

HAL
What happened Does anyone know

BEDFORD
Hey Hey

But they’re gone as quickly as they came back into the
smoke no answers

The group is once again alone

LERNER
What the hell is going on

BEDFORD
I don’t know

DISTANT POPS AND BANGS from behind -- a CRACK almost like
lighting THE AIR SIZZLES

Odd lights flash in the dust

KELLY
We should go

Getting closer
SARGE
Move Let’s go
EXT STREET - MORNING
The survivors -- running flat out -- disappearing losing
each other in the dust and smoke tripping over buried

debris around cars downed street lights

Some head in their own directions to escape -- to find loved
ones -- others lost in the smoke for good

Bedford loses sight of Kelly One second she is right next to
him and the next she’s gone

BEDFORD
Kelly

He stops whirls around searching for her

KELLY
I’m right here

BEDFORD
Hold my hand don’t let go

And they’re running again

A few more survivors disappear into the smoke and poof --
gone

The Male Tourist runs legs heavy looking behind when --
SPLAT He trips falling face first in a thick liquid

He pulls his head away from the ground as the glue-like gel
sticks to him pulling at his skin

He rips it free getting to his feet looking at MOUNDS OF
DARK FLESHY-PINK AND BROWN LIQUID scattered in clumps
pooling on the sides of the street in the gutters

He wipes the goo off his body when he notices his hands

Steamingsmoking

Down the row of fleeing survivors -- two more trip and fall
in the mounds of sludge sticking to their skin like syrup

And then the SCREAMING starts
Intensepain-riddenconvulsing
The sickly substance burning into their skin like acid

SURVIVOR
FUUUCKK BURNING

BEDFORD
Over here We need help

Hal and the others double back seeing the coated survivors
THEIR BODIES STEAMS RELEASING SURFACE FLUID MIST COMES OFF

THEM LIKE SWEAT ON A COLD DAY EXCEPT THEY ARENT SWEATING
AND IT ISN’T COLD

SKIN TURNING TRANSLUCENT VEINS SPREADING AND RISING BODIES
SECRETING A STICKY SUBSTANCE

BEDFORD
What-- What happened
(to Kelly)
Stay back

LERNER
Holy shit

HAL
I don’t know I--

SARGE
Hey Doctor Get over here

Alex rushes over stops in mid step upon seeing the bodies

SARGE
The hell is wrong with them

ALEX
I don’tI don’t know I--

SARGE
You a goddamn doctor or aren’t you

ALEX
Kinda not yet I’m a med student

HAL
Christ

SURVIVOR
SHIT Help me Help me

Alex takes a step toward them medical training taking over
but Sarge stops her grabbing onto her arm He shakes his
head ‘no’

ALEX
Let go of me I need to help them

SARGE
There’s no helping them

MALE TOURIST
It’s burning Oh God

SURVIVOR
AHHHHH

They claw at their skin ripping it in acid-like pain
SPIDER-WEBBED VEINS SPREAD OVER THEIR SKIN LIFTING FLUIDS

IN THEM TRYING TO GET OUT THOSE VEINS TURN BLACK AS BLOOD
LOSES WATER AND OXYGENATION THEY VOMIT BLOOD AND BILE

The survivors back away from the injured

KELLY
What do we do
It dawns as they look at the MOUNDS OF DARK FLESHY-PINK AND
BROWN LIQUID on the streets buildings cars It’s

everywhere surrounding them

HAL
Oh Jesus Christ

BEDFORD
No one touch a thing Not a thing

KELLY
It’s everywhere

LERNER
What do we do What do we do

Another survivor backs away puts a hand on a street lamp
leaning against it -- something dark flowing down his arm

He slowly looks at his arm -- as goo pools down it covering
the lamp Fuck

He tries to swat the liquid off but it sticks to him
And he crumples seized by crippling pain

As the infected melt -- TURNING INTO THE SAME SLUDGE ON THE
STREETS AND BUILDINGS

POPS AND BANGS growing closer coming from behind They
need to run need to hide --

BEDFORD
Inside Now

Sarge spots an Army Surplus Store store across the way
familiar grounds and makes toward it

BEDFORD
Let’s go Everyone inside Come on
come on

The others move fast pile through the doorway and --

INT ARMY SURPLUS STORE - SAME

SLAM Door bolted Everyone inside It’s quieter in here
Spares dust

Scattered with used clothing cheap Army gear old
electronics Mannikins racks hangers toppled

Bedford and the others catch their breaths their frayed
confused nerves looking out the window keeping hidden
They’re having a really bad day

A few other survivors joining them along with ANDY a
skinny long-haired drifter

KELLY
What is that

HAL
What

KELLY
That There The streetit looks
like it’s moving

A low lying dark undulating mass like a midnight wave
roiling across the street --

ALEX
Rats

Hundreds of them brown black big small -- all running
past down the street - as if fleeing something

SARGE
Like a sinking ship

As the last few stranglers disappear west into the dust

LERNER
Where are they going

HAL
Who cares

LERNER

I do They’re running from
somethinglike those
peoplethey were running from
something too Everyone is goddamn
running except for us

HAL
Hey take it easy

LERNER
I don’t want to take it easy You
take it easy

(MORE )

LERNER (CONTD)
Those people they said they were
still here Who’s “they” Huh Who

BEDFORD
I don’t know I don’t have any
answers

HAL

They did it They finally did it

ALEX
You don’t know that We don’t know
anything

KELLY

What Like nuclear

BEDFORD
We’d be dead already And we’re
not So calm down keep it
together

HAL
Biological Some disease A virus
maybe

Eyes turning to Alex

ALEX
It seems like like radiation
poisoning but I’ve never This
thing whatever it was it was so
fast that I doubt whether anything
could have been done to prevent it
spreading before it was too late

A silent beat as everyone absorbs the implications when --

BAM A solitary MAN smacks into the window pounding on it
Everyone jumps nerves already on edge

MAN
Let me in Please God They’re
coming Open the door

Confused by this terrified man unsure what to do

BEDFORD
Let him in Open the door

When no one volunteers Bedford steps forward doing it his
damn self but Sarge blocks the door with his body

SARGE
It’s too late for him
BEDFORD
Too late He’s right there Unlock

the door

Bedford goes to the door but Sarge holds him off with a
hand

BEDFORD
You’re not in charge This isn’t a
democracy

SARGE
You’re right It ain’t Whoever did
this they’re in charge they’re
calling the shots Not us

The man pounds on the glass then hears something off to his
side head whipping that way

SARGE
You can grasp it now or later but
eventually you’1l come to see it
the way I do

BEDFORD
See what you crazy bastard

SARGE
That sometimes the only way to save
a rabid dog is to put it down
And Sarge steps away letting Bedford decide

Bedford looks at the faces of the others turned away Fuck
them He moves to the door

But the man slowly backs away then runs disappearing into
the dust Decision made for him

Silence Beat
A LOUD POP OF AIR AND A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT

Something flies at the storefront window and HITS with a
sickly crack The window splinters The group SCREAMS

It’s the man they wouldn’t let in -- body cracked infection
spreading rotting him

Everyone stares stock-still Terror

ROSALES
What the fuck did that

KELLY
There’s something out there Dad --

BEDFORD
Get down Quiet

That’s when they see it -- SHAPES -- moving outside in the
smoke dark and gangly Terrifying

They pass by Searching Their movements make them look as if
they were underwater -- flowing languid an underwater
ballet

And then they’re gone

SARGE
This was no earthquake

LERNER
What then

SARGE
War

INT ARMY SURPLUS STORE - LATER

Sarge rummages through the shelves and counters throwing
useless junk out of his way gearing up for battle - whether
real or in his head A soldier doing the only thing he knows

A few old WWII walkie-talkies with hand cranks -- places them
on the counter adding them to the pile of tape rope an
unreliable shotgun and shells flares glow sticks folding
knife - anything that doesn’t run on batteries

Rosales tinkers with a CB short wave radio but only gets
STATIC

Lerner takes out his cell phone - dead battery drained
without a signal

LERNER
I charged it last night

Alex searches the store finds a pile of cell phones in a
box all dead She roots through comes out with a charger
Plugs it into the outlet then her phone Nothing

Tries the light switches a TV plugged into the wall

ALEX
There’s no power Everything
electronic is out

Bedford and Kelly sitting nearby by themselves weary

KELLY
What does it mean

BEDFORD
We’re not going to be able to
contact anyone from here

Hal pacing can’t sit still

HAL
How’s that radio coming

ROSALES
It’s fried but I think I can get
it working

HAL
How do you know so much about them

ROSALES
Just comes natural I guess Never
really put it to use before Always
tinkered with them when I was
younger Liked ‘em better than
books I could see what they were
made of Made sense

Bedford is still shaken hides it from his daughter staring
at the wet smear on the window the man made

BEDFORD

We could’ve saved him
SARGE

Let it go
BEDFORD

It can’t disregard people as easily
as you This didn’t have to happen

SARGE
None of this had to happen but it
did You coulda opened the door
But you didn’t And that’s why
we’re still breathing
LERNER
So what do we do We can’t stay
here What if they come back

HAL
What if they don’t What if we go
out there and walk right into them

SARGE
Fucked if we do fucked if we
don’t

KELLY
There has to be a safe place
Police military someone

BEDFORD
City General How far is it from
here

ALEX
Five blocks Six maybe

LERNER
You think we can we make it

ROSALES
I saw we try There’s a police
station next door They have
radios guns

HAL
Can’t chance it sending everyone
Not if those people are still out
there

BEDFORD
We split up Send a few people out
use the radios to communicate If
it’s safe we all go

HAL
I say we wait it out Play it safe
Who’s with me

No one
BEDFORD

So We need three people Any
volunteers

MOMENTS LATER

Three survivors suit up led by Andy -- putting on rubber
boots duct taping sleeves and pant legs closed bandanas
over mouths and noses goggles

SARGE
Listen up Radio’s old but it
works fine Make sure you wind it
every ten minutes

Sarge places the self-winding radio in Andys hand

SARGE
City Gen has an emergency center
right next to the police station
About five blocks away If there’s
help that’s where you’1ll find it
You keep straight Figure in the
smoke debris it’1ll take you
fifteen twenty minutes Anything
goes wrong you don’t think You
turn back and run

ANDY
Just for the record I’m not liking
this At all

SARGE
Noted

They turn and exit cautiously out the door The group watches
from the windows as they move away disappearing into the
smoke

INT ARMY SURPLUS STORE BATHROOM - MORNING

Rosales stands in the bathroom resting his arms on the sink
staring at his reflection in the mirror

He tries the faucet It RATTLES GROANS dried up He looks
in the toilet -- no water in there either Odd

Closing his eyes he puts his hands on his head takes in the
air tries to settle himself A few deep breaths as he paces
Not working

He tosses the metal garbage call It CRASHES to the floor

INT ARMY SURPLUS STORE

Sarge stands at the windows and looks out at the city on the
walkie-talkie

ANDY (ON WALKIE)
Nothing yet No people Getting
really thick up here Hard to tell
where we are Olive I think

SARGE
(into walkie)
Keep looking Should only be a
couple blocks out

ANDY (ON WALKIE)
Uh yeah roger that

Bedford sits on the floor against the counter thoughts far
away as he stares vacantly at the door sign WELCOME Arm
around Kelly

ANDY (ON WALKIE)

What Where-- No I got it
(to Sarge)

Okay City Gen here Going in

SARGE
(into walkie-talkie)
What do you see

ANDY (ON WALKIE)

Yeah there’s nothing here You
want us to keep looking ‘cause I’d
rather not if that’s cool

Sarge steps to the doorway and stares out at the city His
jaw trembles slightly and he locks it in place

HAL
There’s no one

BEDFORD
We will survive this You hear me

KELLY
We did survive

BEDFORD
That’s right We did We’re still
here We keep our heads and we’1l
continue to be here

ANDY (ON WALKIE)
Guys Hello

FEMALE SURVIVOR (ON WALKIE)
(to Andy)
You have to wind it

ANDY (ON WALKIE)
I did wind it

SARGE
(into walkie)
Turn it around and head back Bring
everything useful -- antibiotics
bandages iodine Anything you can

Sarge lowers the walkie the group disheartened No hope for
a rescue Then

ANDY (ON WALKIE)
Hear-- oises clicking

SARGE
(into walkie)
Youre breaking up Say again Did
you find something

The others take interest everyone listening Hal and Alex
moving up to Sarge to hear better

ANDY (ON WALKIE)
--the smoke -- see that someone
in there -- we’re not -—-

SARGE
(into walkie)
Not what Andy Repeat that Not
what

A silent tense beat as everyone stares at the walkie-talkie
Static No voice no reply

Then a click broken noises and

ANDY (ON WALKIE)
We’re -- not -- alone

Their voices cut abruptly filled with PULSING STATIC A LOW
CLICKING SOUND washes over the radio interference

Hal grabs the walkie from Sarge

HAL
(into walkie)
Andy Talk to me Goddamnit hello

The radio has gone quiet They stare in silent fear

EXT ARMY SURPLUS STORE STREET

They slowly move out into the smoke and dust looking in the
direction the missing group went in There’s nothing there

SARGE
What’s going on hereit’s
standard operating procedure

HAL
Operating procedure

SARGE
For war Cut off your enemy’s
resources and infrastructure
Communications police hospitals
roads electricity food - all to
make them more vulnerable
susceptible

ALEX
Susceptible to what

SARGE
Invasion

Off this upbeat remark Rosales hurries out to the others
ROSALES
I got something on the radio
INT ARMY SURPLUS STORE - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON a walkie-talkie STATIC Red light blinking Rosales
holding it out The group mills around

HAL
Yeah we’ve heard the static

ROSALES
Not like this you havent

Rosales turns up the volume LOUDER STATIC

ROSALES
Just listen for it

A beat then the sound of a VOICE sifts through barely
audible in the noise

Everyone freezes Ears perk Heartbeats race Rosales adjusts
the frequency and

A WORLD OF PANICKED VOICES

Dozens and dozens all talking at the same time over each
other panic They pick up fragments multiple voices

A cacophony of sound broken by STATIC impossible to tell
one voice from another or what’s being said but voices of

KELLY
Survivors

ALEX
What are they saying I can’t make
anything out

HAL
Bomb Did someone say bomb
Anyone hear that

LERNER
Ocean I heard ocean

ROSALES
They’re meeting up

BEDFORD
Where

ROSALES

Don’t know Can’t make it out
Something about a fallout shelter
Signal’s too weak

BEDFORD
Anyway you can boost it
ROSALES
We gotta get higher out of this
smoke
HAL
Good luck
ALEX

So we’re back to square one then
Stay leave
LERNER
I know a place

They turn to Lerner standing in the back

SARGE
Show us

MOMENTS LATER

Sarge unfolds a map on top of the glass display case He
points out the locations

LERNER
(points)

Here I temp at the Cal Trans
offices in the Federal Building
just off the freeway They have
radios satellites It’s in a high
rise so it should be above the
smoke But I’m not guaranteeing

anything
BEDFORD
Alright Then that’s where we’re
headed
(re map)

Where are we

SARGE
Somewhere around here

HAL
That’s a full day on foot At best
A lot can happen in a day

KELLY
A lot did happen in a day

HAL
I can’t go out there again I
can’t

BEDFORD

Anyone else

ALEX
If just one of those survivors is
infected

BEDFORD
Then they’re infected I’m not
prepared to sit here and wait for
help when I’m pretty sure that it’s
never going to come We’ve got no
food no water no supplies For
all we know we could be shut away
in here with help just around the
corner So you want to stay stay
I’m getting my daughter out of
here

HAL
We don’t know what’s out there

SARGE
No But I know what’s in here And
it ain’t gonna save me

ALEX
I’m going Safety in numbers
right

LERNER

Me too I mean I know the building
so I’m needed I can be of use

HAL
What’s gonna happen when we go out
there We don’t know

SARGE
Not yet
MOMENTS LATER
The group gears up -- rubber gloves and boots face masks

bandanas scarves goggles duct tape securing it all
shielding themselves as much as possible from the infection
and dust

Bedford loops up a long rope and hands it to the group
BEDFORD
Take a loop and pass it down Tie
onto one another
They take a loop and latch on Sarge opens the door
SARGE
On the count of three And don’t
stop for nothing

Sarge cocks the shotgun Kelly looks to Bedford He nods

SARGE
One Two

EXT DOWNTOWN LA - DAY

The smoke moves and come alive -- ghostly silhouettes coming
into view closer out of the smoke

The survivors struggling through the dust Hard to breath
hard to see Moving at different speeds tugging against the
rope

IN THE THICK SMOKY ATMOSPHERE IT’S AS IF THE GROUP WERE
UNDERWATER UNABLE TO SEE MORE THAN TWENTY FEET IN ANY
DIRECTION

They pass empty stores and deserted cars a massive crashed
satellite a news van lying on its side antenna extended
across the street

Passing infected bodies scattered in different stages of
decomposition fusing together pools of human by-product

A landscape of biological nightmare

A building comes out of the smoke towering high above the
passing group A COCA-COLA BILLBOARD plastered on its side
paint pealing -- a family drinking soda smiling Norman
Fucking Rockwell America

Lerner plays with the walkie filling the air with PULSING
STATIC

Faster louder eerie Same on every channel

LERNER
What do you think it is

HAL
Annoying Turn it off

ROSALES
Interference Nothing

LERNER
Sounds like a pattern though
Listen See High low high high--

ALEX
You guys notice something We’ve
been walking a whileand the road
looks exactly the same

But Sarge isn’t paying attention distracted by something on
the street below squatting and taking a closer look

ODD FOOTPRINTS THE DUST -- animal maybe but definitely not
human

BEDFORD
Sarge You coming

The wind blows dust filling in the prints disappearing
Sarge keeps it to himself

EXT STREET - DAY
As they continue forward they come to an abrupt stop

LERNER
Okay So there’s that

Before them is a thirty story apartment building -- toppled
blocking the entire street

HAL
Great Now what

To their left is a crashed semi To their right a tunnel
underneath the streets above The 3rd St Tunnel

EXT TUNNEL — DAY

The group moves through around deserted cars around human
remains turned sludge Sections of the ceiling have broken
through throwing shafts of light into the dark tunnel

The smoke is thinner in here yet at each end of the tunnel
opening it is a solid wall of white

KELLY
I have to sit down can’t breath

BEDFORD
Sarge we gotta take a break Just
for a second

SARGE
Five minutes

They sit where they can - on and in cars the street Shaking
dust off their bodies clearing their eyes and mouth

Sarge stands guard at the tunnel entrance ever vigilant
Embroiled in thought he gazes out at the smoke

Somewhere else Somewhere better Befriending the silence
until

LERNER
So you were like a soldier or
something

Lerner sitting on the ground against the wall eyes on
Sarge who doesn’t acknowledge him

LERNER
Cool cool

Sarge eyes the smoke hoping the conversation’s over
LERNER
Like Desert Storm and stuff For
the oil right That’s what they
said The reason we went to war
Sarge looks decidedly less amiable now
LERNER
(off Sarge’s icy glare)
Alright alright I’11 shut up

But there’s barely a beat before --

LERNER

I thought about joining you know
The Corps or Marines maybe a
sniper stuff like that And you
know school wasn’t really my
thing so Never really fit in
found my place and such --

SARGE
I’d like you to stop talking now

Lerner’s eyes are still on Sarge who grows more agitated by
the second And Lerner a child in a twenty-something’s body

LERNER
Y’ever kill anyone

Sarge looks instantly open to the possibility as we go to
BEDFORD and KELLY

Sitting on the trunk of a car catching their breath Dust
caked on them

KELLY
(choking)
What ifwe can’t find anyone
What if no one comes

BEDFORD
(an uncertain beat)
Someone’1l1 come

KELLY
What if it’s the wrong someone

The question hangs before

SARGE
Five minutes is up

Sarge hikes up his gear and trudges on out of the tunnel

ALEX
So I guess we’re walking again

ROSALES
Guess so

The group goes to follow

EXT CITY STREETS - DAY

TIGHT ON A GLOVED HAND It wipes hard caked-on dust off a
street sign Sandblasted Little paint now covers it The
remains of what appears to be an ‘N’ is seen

Kelly is on Rosales’s shoulders at the street sign
KELLY
This one too Nothing left I think
there’s an ‘N’
Rosales helps her down and they join the others
They’ve been moving for a while now tired and winded
covered in soot and white ash Sarge like always is off by

himself

LERNER
Maybe it’s Green Street

ROSALES
There is no Green Street

LERNER
There has to be a Green Street Or
maybe it’s Broadway

HAL
Broadway There’s no ‘N’ in
Broadway

LERNER

It looked like an ‘N’ Could just
as easily be an ‘M’

HAL
‘M’ In Broadway Jesus Lerner

Rosales opens the side doors of a Budweiser truck and takes
out a case of beer surprisingly light

The bottles and cans are sealed but empty of fluid He
throws them to the street and slumps

ALEX
All right Which way are we
walking

BEDFORD
(points)
That way That’s the way we’ve been
going so we keep at it

HAL
We gotta turn ahead get over to
Spring

ROSALES

I think this is Spring it just
looks different

ALEX
Where are we going Seriously Can
someone tell me because I have no
idea anymore

LERNER
I can tell you

ALEX
Anyone besides Lerner

DISTANT NOISES POPS AND BANGS EXPLOSIONS just like before
But louder closer It’s unnerving the survivors

KELLY
What is that What’s that noise

BEDFORD
It’s nothing

But Bedford doesn’t look so sure Just as scared as the rest
of them trying to hide it

He takes the lead

Sarge leads turning down the right street trudging ever
forward

He listens to the walkie The MULTITUDE OF VOICES continue to
flood the lines

Alex comes up keeping pace wiping the dust from her face

ALEX

Why’re you still listening to that
SARGE

Keeps me going
ALEX

It’s just noise
SARGE

Not to me
ALEX

(then)

You’re not scared

Sarge shuts of the radio He reaches deep down struggling
with unfamiliar feelings Finally

SARGE
No

And he leaves Alex with that They stare out at the city
before them in the direction of DISTANT NOISES Listening
There’s nothing else to say

EXT STREET - DAY

They move on over and around obstacles in their path
forcing them to cut down a street surrounded by low-rise

buildings

The sun dips behind one creating BOXES OF LIGHT on the
street as it passes through the building’s windows

Bedford notices the light squares on the street

And what looks like a figure’s SHADOW moving through them

As if it were following the group from above -- inside the
building

Bedford stops the others passing him blindly

And so does the shadow

He looks up at the building’s windows where the sun shines
through but there is nothing else there No person

Yet the shadow is still there on the ground coming from
inside the building

Bedford continues to walk

And the shadow starts to move again keeping pace
Bedford stops The shadow stops

Rosales cranes back to see Bedford

ROSALES
Hold up

He makes his way back to Bedford

ROSALES
You good

Before he can answer -- the shadow slinks down and
disappears leaving only boxes of light from the building

BEDFORD
Something’s following us

HAL
(calls back)
What what is it

Bedford and Rosales trade eyes Make a tactic covenant to
say

ROSALES
Nothing Let’s keep going Only
gonna get darker

They keep moving catching up with the others Bedford steals
a look behind at the shadows

LATER

The group still walking slowing weaning Legs growing
heavier Sarge in the lead no sign of slowing no sign of
stopping

ROSALES
We should of been there by now At
least to the freeway

SARGE
Let’s go Push yourselves

ALEX
We can move as fast as we want but
if we have no clue where we’re
moving to it really doesn’t matter

HAL
I know where we are

LERNER
I disagree

HAL
Lerner shut the fuck up

ALEX
Two hours We’re lost in the
middle of the city We can walk any
way

BEDFORD
We need to get our bearings

SARGE
Enough All of you No more
complaining No more stopping
Anyone who stops stays stopped

BEDFORD
What You’d leave us Just like
that

SARGE

Just like that
And Sarge steps away done with the conversation
HAL

We’re all fucked This whole thing
it’s a waste of time

The smoke and dust shift and enclose on the crew growing
thicker in waves

ALEX
SHUT UP Stop fighting and think

Sarge lost in his own world looking out at the devastated
landscape

SARGE
It’s a war we got here and one we
aren’t going to win And I’1l1 tell
you why Because it’s a war without
meaning

LERNER
So where do we go from here

BEDFORD
The plan hasn’t changed We
survived That means others did
too We get to Cal Trans find the
meeting place

HAL
You’re all goddamn insane We
should have never of left the
store We’d be safe

BEDFORD
Hal just calm down take a breath--

HAL
A breathe We’re drowning in this
smoke We shouldn’t be here--

Hal’s voice cuts off -- abrupt and sudden

The group turns to him as a patch of dark smoke idles past
then dissipates

HAL IS GONEVANISHED INTO THE SMOKE

BEDFORD
Hal Hey Hal

KELLY
Where’d he go

Sarge and Rosales walk to the spot Hal was just occupying He
is nowhere in sight

ROSALES
Coward ran away

Sarge looks at the dust on the street Hal’s footprints are
scattered about but none lead away

SARGE
I don’t think so

An ODD CLICKING breaks the silence
PULSING STATIC

Heads turn to the radio in Lerner’s hand They stare at it
the sound hypnotic full of dread

SARGE
Turn it off

Lerner switches it off Silence
Beat

Then MORE CLICKING

SARGE
I told you to turn it off
LERNER
I did
It’s not coming from the radio They look in the direction

of the sounds There’s something there in the smoke
The shape of a FIGURE A MAN

LERNER
Hello

The Man sways ever so slightly Rocking back and forth The
source of the clicks

ALEX
Hal

The figure doesn’t move Doesn’t speak

BEDFORD
Something’s wrong

LERNER
Hal Is that you

Sarge switches on the radio -- quick pulsing STATIC Shares a
look with Bedford He looks back at the figure

KELLY
Why isn’t he talking

SARGE
Because it ain’t him

The statement lurches in everyone’s stomachs Catatonic
stares and dread as the figure just watches them

BEDFORD
We should go

LERNER
It’s him Look

ALEX
This isn’t right

LERNER
He might need help --

BEDFORD
He doesn’t need any help Lerner
That’s not him

LERNER
Who the hell is it then

Bedford backs away keeping Kelly behind him Rosales and
Alex follow suit Sarge moves away

LERNER
What is wrong with you people It’s
him

Lerner starts toward the Man

SARGE
Lerner the fuck are you doing

ROSALES
Lerner Get back here now

BEDFORD
It’s not Hal

LERNER
Screw you I know what I’m doing

LERNER

Keeps moving forward growing more diffused in the patchy
smoke

Moving up to the Man becoming clearer

Hal It is him

But there is something off about him

Just the very tips of his toes touch the ground as if almost
floating -- limbs dangling lifeless his eyes solid white
And then the sludge starts to drip from his orifices

Lerner stops Realizing his mistake too late as --

Hal’s dead body drops to the ground and --

SOMETHING RISES BEHIND IT SOMETHING LARGE AND GANGLY --

Something that was holding Hal’s body suspending it
manipulating it --

PUPPETEERING IT
THE GROUP
Can barely make out Lerner’s form ahead of them in the dust

ROSALES
Lerner Lerner

A beat
Lerner collapses legs giving out beneath him
A CRACKLE of air and -- POP -- the figure is gone

For a moment no one moves a muscle stapled down where they
stand Then

BEDFORD
(to Kelly)
Stay here

Bedford Sarge and Rosales slowly move forward to Lerner
Alex stays with Kelly looking worried unable to see

Then they appear dragging Lerner back with them

In a state of shock he just MUMBLES incoherently to himself
cradling his hand in his lap

ALEX
Lerneryou all right What’d you
see
44
He turns and looks through them eyes glossed over He raises
his hand for them to see

LERNER
It touched me

Horrified utterly aghast staring down at --

LERNER’S HAND -- and the black spider-webbed veins that
spread across it

INT GAS STATION - DAY
BOOM -- Sarge kicks the door in holds it open

Bedford and Rosales slide Lerner in and put him down on the
floor

They stand away as he writhes and spasms in intense pain
skin beginning to steam

Infection spreading up his hand

ROSALES
What the hell was that

LERNER
It touched meit touched me

And he’s gagging Gasping

BEDFORD
It’s okayit’s okaybreath

Lerner tries to talk Only able to spit Dying Slowly

KELLY
It’s spreading Oh God what do we
do OhGodohGodohGod

SARGE
It’s too late We leave him behind
or put him down

ALEX
He’s not a dog

SARGE
No he’s infected He’s compromised
and it’ll spread to all of us

KELLY
Help him Do something

A beat
ALEX
Give me your knife
(off looks)
The armwe gotta stop it from

spreading
Sarge looks at her then Lerner

ALEX
You want him to die Give me the
goddamn knife

BEDFORD
Give it to her

Sarge hands her the folding blade

ALEX
(to Lerner)
This is going to hurt like hell
I’m sorry

But Lerner’s limbs are thrashing now trying to free himself

ALEX
Hold him down

Rosales and Bedford comply pinning him down Bedford’s knee
pressed on Lerner’s upper arm

ALEX
(to Rosales)
Your belt Tie it above his elbow
Tight as you can

Rosales does as he’s told

ALEX
I’m going to need fire Something
to cauterize the wound

Kelly looks around finds a metal coffee pot

KELLY
Hows this

ALEX
It’ll do Start heating up the
bottom of it use one of those
lighters Hot as possible

BEDFORD
You’ve done this before

ALEX
First time for everything

Alex kneels gripping the blade above Lerner’s wrist Bedford
holds him harder

Lerner struggles tries to get away

ROSALES
It’s for your own good Lerner

LERNER
No NO NOOOO

Infection spreading past the elbow --

BEDFORD
Do it now You gotta do it now

The blade shakes in Alex’s hand

SARGE
Now dammit

Alex STABS the blade hard just above the wrist -- a WET
THUNK the knife sticking into bone

Lerner SCREAMS spit flying from his mouth

LERNER
AEEEEEIIIII

Lerner thrashes a fish out of water

ALEX
Hold him

Rosales and Bedford pin Lerner harder to the floor

Sounds of SAWING DISLODGING SPLATTERS CHIPPING

Infection up to the shoulder now --

Rosales opens his eyes on the mess that is Lerner’s hand He
turns away and vomits Tears well in Bedford’s eyes He wipes
them away with a muck-stained hand

Veins spiderweb across his chest -- to his neck --

Alex saws Metal on bone She tries to cut through Not
working

ALEX
I can’t get itDammit I can’t
get through the bone--

Infection pulsing under Lerner’s throat -- into his head --
eyes bleeding -- veins rising -- turning black --
BEDFORD

We’re too late--
And -- BANG
Lerner’s head EXPLODES from the shotgun blast
Wielded by Sarge standing over him

Everyone stunned to silence -- speckled in blood -- Lerner
gone and --

Bedford loses it

He springs to his feet barrels into Sarge shoving him back
knocking over a spinning display rack of LA postcards and
pins him down against the counter

BEDFORD
You sonofabitch You goddamn
sonofabitch I’11 end you

Sarge doesn’t fight back just takes it Rosales pulls
Bedford away

BEDFORD
You killed him You You killed
him

Bedford shoves Rosales off spin and slams to the other side
of the store

LATER

The group is ashen with despair and emotion separated from
each other

Sarge standing guard at the door with the gun Alex crouched
against the wall head in hands Kelly is at the window
looking out

Rosales is tinkering with one of the walkie-talkies mind off
the covered body of Lerner in the center of the room Kelly
watching

KELLY
It’s like a warning then That
pulsing static clicking

ROSALES
Appears to be

KELLY
How’s it possible

ROSALES
Not sure Whatever’s doing this
it’s causing some type of
interference

ALEX (0S)
Radiation

They look to Alex who hasn’t moved

ALEX
The others who were infectedthey
showed signs of extreme radiation
poisoning Nuclear almost

ROSALES
If it was strong enoughyeah it
could cause the radios to go
haywire pick up interference

KELLY
Radiation

ALEX
It’s energy -- like electricity
fire -- which all produce heat
Except radiation it works from the
inside out Melting as it were

As she nods to Lerner’s covered corpse beginning to liquefy
To melt To become the human infection

ALEX
It heats up the water inside a
body which is about three quarters
of a human being The water’s
expelled Evaporated

KELLY
Why didn’t it effect us We
survived

ROSALES
Lead Lead paint saved us There
were renovations being done to the
subway tunnel I saw warning signs

ALEX
Lead blocks radiation

KELLY
So it was nuclear then

ALEX
We don’t know that We’re fine

ROSALES
Yeah but for how long

Shaken Kelly moves up and gazes out the window at the
darkening streets trying not to listen to the conversation
continuing behind her

For a moment she seems on the verge of tears then Bedford
steps up to her coming out from the back room doing his
best to play dad and comfort his daughter

BEDFORD
Hey

KELLY
It’s getting dark How long do we
have

BEDFORD
Until night Few more hours at
least

KELLY

I’ve never seen you mad before
Never seen you anything for that
matter

BEDFORD
I’m sorry Ilost my temper and
(realizing)
What does that mean

KELLY
It’s why mom left right Why you
two got a divorce She said

BEDFORD
Said what

KELLY
She called you an emotional
invalid Said you never felt
anything Or if you did you
couldn’t express it When she told
you she was leaving you you
didn’t do anything You let her go
When she told you she was dying

BEDFORD
She wanted me to --

KELLY
She wanted you to fight for her
Like she did They gave her a
month she lasted eight

BEDFORD
I’m not sure what I’m supposed to
say butI’m sorry--

KELLY
There’s nothing to say It’s too
late now isn’t it She’s gone And
so is the rest of the world But
thanksfor trying and all

BEDFORD
Kelly

Bedford puts his arm awkwardly around her trying to comfort
her but she just turns away and sits down at the opposite
end of the store

Bedford looks back out the window catching his wayward
breath and reflection in the glass Doesn’t like what he
sees moving away from the window

But something is very wrong

HIS REFLECTION IS STILL ON THE WINDOW IT HASN’T MOVED

Then the reflection shifts -- and we see it

A DARK FIGURE

Staring in Its undefined semi-translucent body reflects the
surroundings Its features seem indiscernible inert almost

frozen in a perfectly symmetrical pattern

It slowly backs away and disappears into the smoke

EXT CITY STREETS - LATE DAY

The group walks at an even clip fast and alert still lost
It’s hard to see in the thick heavy atmosphere

Night’s nearly fallen the sky bleeding a deep orange hue a
precursor to total darkness

They all look up as they pass a church front doors blown

open showing the hollowed out insides covered with a thin
layer of dust

The wind strikes its bell tower It RINGS INCONSISTENTLY

KELLY
There The freeway

The towering form of the freeway overpass comes up on them
from out of the smoke like a great whale

ROSALES
Thank you God

And all at once they move off the street venturing towards
the curving on-ramp to the freeway

EXT FREEWAY - LATE DAY

Cracked roads covered with more debris Dead and deserted
cars some crashed into others one minivan coated in

infection

Our group moves through and around waning in strength and
fortitude Skin is dry cracked mouths begging for water

As they move around a school bus we notice a shape inside
almost transparent

As the door slowly opens behind our group unseen

They come to a stop having reached an impasse

A FIFTY FOOT STRETCH OF THE FREEWAY HAS COLLAPSED an 80 foot
drop below Cars have fallen through crashed at the bottom

in rubble

A fire truck hangs partway off the edge balanced
precariously

BEDFORD
We have to turn around

SARGE
The hell we do

Sarge climbs atop the fire truck moving to the base of the
ladder tossing debris off and manually extends the ladder
spinning the lever around and around

Slowly the ladder extends reaching across the cavity to the
other side

ALEX

You can’t be serious
SARGE

You know me to make jokes
ALEX

Fair enough
SARGE

I’ll go first Make sure it’s safe
ALEX

Be careful
ROSALES

Are we seriously doing this

BEDFORD
What choice do we have

Sarge climbs up onto the horizontal ladder and begins to
crawl across on his hands and knees keeping his balance

It wobbles a bit but he makes it across Turns back to the
others

SARGE
Get moving

Kelly’s up leans over the edge a terrifying drop beneath

KELLY

Nono wayI can’t do this
BEDFORD

Yes you can Hey look at me

Kelly
She looks him in the eyes terrified
BEDFORD

You can do this I’‘1l come with
you help you across

KELLY
I can’t

BEDFORD
You can Say it Say it out loud

KELLY
(beat)
I can do it

BEDFORD
With conviction Mean it

KELLY
I can do it

BEDFORD
Good Then do it

She nods trembling

BEDFORD
Nothing’s going to happen See

Bedford gets onto the ladder then Kelly tentatively climbs
up arms shaking fiercely

She takes it one stepcrawl at a time keeping her eyes on
Bedford who crawls backwards

BEDFORD
Just keep looking at me You’re
doing great

And they make it to the other side Kelly falling into her
father’s arms

BEDFORD
That’s my girl

Rosales goes next not looking down struggles almost loses
his balance gets across

SARGE
Alex get a move on It ain’t gonna
hold

Alex nervously gets up onto the ladder Begins her journey
across when --

A POP behind them the dust swirling

They’re not alone

ROSALES
Oh shit Kelly Check the radio
Kelly flicks on the walkie -- STATIC PULSATING
BEDFORD

Alex Hurry

SARGE
Run for it

She jerks herself onto her legs begins to run when --

The bridge begins to wobble beneath the truck It isn’t going
to hold The fire truck shifts but holds in place

Alex almost loses her balance but keeps her footing

ALEX
It’s okayI’m okay

Cars begin to roll down the now tilted bridge falling off
the edge CRASHING into the fire truck pushing it

SARGE
She’s not going to make it

Alex falls

Her head hits the metal ladder foot wrenched into the rungs
Hanging upside down

Blood drips from her forehead nothing in focus anymore
Sarge shoves past tossing Bedford the shotgun forgetting
about his personal safety -- forgetting his mantra -- rushing
onto the ladder over to Alex

He lays flat on the ladder and reaches out for her

SARGE
Reach up Take my hand

The truck is jostled by more cars crashing into it

SARGE
Give me your hand Goddamnit Reach

Alex does and Sarge gets her by the wrist straining
pulling her up by sheer force

SARGE
Now run

Almost to the other side the truck lurches forward as cars
smash into it
It teeter-totters tipping and

The ladder hits the ground on the other side the truck now
stationary

Alex makes it to the other side reaches solid ground when a
loud GRINDING is heard and --

ALEX
No

They make eye contact

And then -- the truck falls -- taking Sarge with it
disappearing below into the swirling smoke

-Gone

Alex stares down into the roiling smoke eyes pleading A
blow struck right to her gut

Bedford rushes up to her pulling her away
BEDFORD
Come on we have to go Alex He’s
gone Move

Bedford drags Alex away

Across the way the air ripples blurring -- a CRACKLE in the
air a POP The dust swirls then settles

Whatever was there is now gone as the walkie-talkie returns
to normal white noise
INT FEDERAL BUILDING - EVENING

A high rise dead and hollowed-out Tendrils of human waste
drift from gutted out windows

They trudge up and enter

INT FEDERAL BUILDING LOBBY
A scattered building directory Cal Trans labelled - 2100

They move past dead elevators to the door labeled STAIRS

INT STAIRWAY

21 flights up Slow moving

INT FEDERAL BUILDING CALTRANS OFFICES

Full of cubicles desks and dead computers peeling paint
glass-walled offices empty water coolers

And lava-like mounds of human by-product sickly networks of
root-like flesh complex patterns

Tendrils of human waste drift toward the far end of the room
in slow waves as if being sucked out by a natural vacuum

The group moves through avoiding it ducking under wisps
that hang off the ceiling

A gauntlet of infected human waste to move through

They follow the moving flesh to the far end of the room and
stop before the blown out floor-to-ceiling windows

THE CITY SPREAD OUT BEFORE THEM

A sea of rolling smoke below like looking down on the
clouds It stretches as far as they can see

Coated buildings hardly recognizable anymore from all the
infection spreading up them

It looks like some kind of massive termite city
ALEX
We’re never gonna understand this

Never

-No longer belonging to the human world

INT CALTRANS RADIO ROOM - EVENING

DOZENS OF SMALL TELEVISION MONITORS line the wall each
labelled with a different grid number

Below is an operating station of controls and computers Off
to the side are dozens of digital tape recorder decks stacked
on top of each other and large servers

Rosales is at work connecting the radios using battery
packs jerry-rigging wires and cables Bedford and Kelly
watching Alex not present

KELLY
(re monitors)
What’s all this stuff

ROSALES
Traffic cameras I think

BEDFORD
Can you get the radios online

ROSALES
I can try

Rosales walks to the surge box

ROSALES
Most of these places have their own
generators powering them in case--

KELLY
Of the end of the world

ROSALES
--Power outages

Rosales pumps the pull lever a few times then locks it back
in its upright position

ROSALES
Alright work for daddy

He adjusts the frequency

A small burst of STATIC Then another adjustment
incremental

A VOICE is heard then lost

BEDFORD
Back Go back

Rosales slowly spins the dial back

RECORDED RADIO VOICE
Repeat all civilians are to
proceed directly to Westwood City
Hall and head directly to the
underground bomb shelter National
Guard have been dispatched are have
the situation under control
Repeat all civilians are to
proceed--

Rosales lowers the volume

ROSALES
It’s a recording
BEDFORD
That’s the plan then We’ll stay
here for the night then move out

first thing Agreed

Nods all around

INT CALTRANS OFFICES - SUNSET

Bedford at the windows watching as the sky grows heavy with
the coming darkness

The sun disappears over the city The light moves down them
at the window dimming growing darker and darker Shadows
creep up and spread out
Others all join watching the sun disappear
KELLY

Goodbye sun Think we’ll ever see

it again
EXT CITY - NIGHT
Darkness falls
With no lights or electricity the city is plunged into
black Diffused moonlight filters in through the atmosphere
adding to the murkiness

Night has come and with it a new terror

CUT TO

INT CALTRANS OFFICES - NIGHT

The office door is now barricaded with a desk chairs filing
cabinet

INT CALTRANS BREAK ROOM - LATER

CRASH Alex tosses chairs at the vending machines in the
lobby Working out her emotions

Like before all cans and bottles of soda and water are
sealed yet empty Candy bars chips cookies -- all rotten
covered in mold The water cooler is empty

Bedford stopping in the doorway witnessing

BEDFORD
You alright

ALEX
You know I’ve lived here in the
states for two years now two
years and I’ve never seen the
ocean

BEDFORD
Never

ALEX
I thought I’d go to the beach on a
day off but I didn’t have too many
of those Something always came up

BEDFORD
Something always does

Beat
ALEX
He shouldnt of come back for me
He’d be alive

Bedford listening unsure what to say

ALEX
He broke his rule broke it for me

BEDFORD
And that was what he could do
That’s what he had to give

And Bedford moves out leaving Alex to deal with her demons

INT CALTRANS OFFICES - NIGHT

Bedford sits in a cubicle on the floor alone A moment to
himself Lowers his head

He tries to be strong but can’t hold it in anymore Breaking
down body heaving with sobs

Kelly steps up sits beside a comforting hand on his back A
daughter protecting her father

BEDFORD
I’m sorrystupid of me I’m
supposed to be the strong one It
was always your mother’s job

KELLY
It’s your job now

BEDFORD
I should’ve been there Shouldve
been your father

KELLY
It’s all I ever wanted That’s it

ALEX

Stands across the room watching father and daughter embraced
on the floor in the cubicle

Rosales approaches her face white
ROSALES
You have to see this
INT CALTRANS RADIO ROOM

Everyone gathered Rosales hits the power buttons on the
console The board lights up Tape decks all read 120000

THE MONITORS

Flicker on to snowy receptions A few show live feeds of
different city streets

TRAFFIC CAMS

ALEX
You got it working

Rosales sits at the operating console

ROSALES
Cameras are on twelve hour loops

BEDFORD
Start them from the beginning

Rosales types a few commands on the keyboard Tape decks
switch over to 010000

He hits ‘play’

ON THE MONITORS

As they sputter to life Flickering at differing speeds with
the fluctuating generator power adding to the creepiness

The feeds show normal mid-morning rush hour Cars busses
trains pedestrians All transit all busy downtown streets
None of the angles are great

The digital clock on the bottom of the screens reads 0601A
THE GROUP

Watch the screens

ALEX
There’s nothing

ROSALES
(to Bedford)
What time did your watch stop
Bedford looks at it

BEDFORD
Eight thirty seven am

Rosales fast forwards through the tapes

BEDFORD
ThereStop it there

The tapes read 083600

KELLY
In sixty seconds the world ends

They share tense looks Do they really want to know

BEDFORD
Play it

Rosales hits the ‘play’ button
ON THE MONITORS

The footage is darker now like the sun is setting yet it
should be the exact opposite

- A group of people stop walking and stare up into the sky --
cars stop -- drivers get out eyes glued to the heavens --

- Screens strobe with flashes of lightning -- the ground
shakes knocks some people on their asses --

- A man runs down the street -- then more people running on
more screens -- all fleeing from something in the skies --

- Chaos erupts -- hundreds of people run for their lives --
pushing -- shoving -- screaming -- falling -- trampled --

- Cameras topple crash to the ground feeds severed

- An explosion off screen -- streets rupturing -- an out of
control news helicopter flies past falling from the sky

- Cars speed through the crowds -- run over people -- crash --
fires -- mayhem

- Screens grainier flash and stutter harder to make out
images --

And then they see it

- THE BEGINNINGS OF SHADOWS CRAWL ACROSS THE STREETS FROM
OBJECTS MOVING IN THE SKY BLOTTING OUT THE SUN
IMMENSE DARK SPHERICAL

- UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

- Then a massive jolt as the earth rocks -- ripped apart ina
single blast and --

ALL MONITORS TURN TO SNOW The timecode reads 063700
THE GROUP
Stare at the blank monitors No one says a word

Aliens

INT CALTRANS OFFICES - LATER

A small fire burns in a trash can casting orange and yellow
flickering light across the otherwise dark room

CLOSE ON a cockroach that scurries across the floor
Unaffected In its element

It scuttles past Bedford’s foot sitting on the floor He
watches it

BEDFORD
Guess they were right

Rosales smashes it with his shoe
ROSALES
Well see

waning light

They look ashen helpless desperate Eyes sunken
Skin dry and flaking

The fear on their faces has turned to resignation

This gets a thin smile out of Bedford Kelly sits next him
head on his shoulder out like a light his jacket over her

They all sit around the room amongst scattered papers and
office supplies They’re slumped against the walls lit by

lifeless

Fatigue

and lethargy weigh down on them hit hard by the last 12
hours Constant moving constant fear and lack of food and

water
BEDFORD
You have any family
ROSALES
Back in Mexico My pop he worked
construction Tough man tough
life We didn’t always see eye to
eye you know I’m glad he ain’t
around to see this
Beat

ROSALES
I remember he was called into a
job once and took me in A building
collapsed in an earthquake trapped
a whole bunch of people inside
Days later when they were finally
dug out most were dead One man
he was found with his dog The dog
had lied down next to its owner and
died with him And then there was
this older lady with a cat who was
found And the cat it was still
alive Do you know how it lived

Heads shake

ROSALES
It ate its owner Half the lady was
gone The dog decided life wasn’t
worth living without its best
friend but the cat it went and
did whatever it had to do to
survive Situation changed
instincts stayed the same

A beat as it reaches them thinking it through What are they
made of What is most important Then
BEDFORD

Always was more of a dog person

myself
Smiles And then Alex LAUGHS Hysterically
Contagious as everyone else can’t help but join in Alex’s
eyes tearing she’s laughing so hard

EXT CALTRANS OFFICE BUILDING - SAME

WIDE on the Caltrans building from inside a building across
the street

Every inch dark except for the one section of the 21st floor
with the flickering firelight and the laughter that echoes
across the silent dead city

As a gangly figure moves past -- trained on the building
across the way

DISSOLVE TO

INT CALTRANS OFFICES - LATER

The flames of the fire dying crackling letting more
darkness in when --

Bedford jerks awake eyes snapping open with a sharp intake
of breath - very sudden very frightened How long has he
been sleeping

The walkie-talkie next to him spews STATIC He turns it off
and looks around bleary eyes staring out

Everything looks okay The office is quiet The others are
asleep though not all soundly

Bedford relaxes closes his eyes

Then -- suddenly the SOUNDS of a creak a rustle of papers
FOOTSTEPS

Bedford opens his eyes and the sounds STOP instantly

He looks and stops suddenly when he sees the barricaded
office door

No longer barricaded no longer closed Oh fucking no

He peers out into the office trying to see into the dark
thick atmosphere

There -- something behind Rosales

A SHADOW OF A FIGURE frozen there 20 yards out behind a
cubicle

It looks like a silhouette of a tall gangly man

But it doesnt move At all

It’s deathly quiet as it listens and stares directly at us
Bedford heart in his mouth squints trying to see better

Its just a shadow It has to be No human being looks like
that No human being could stand that still

His heartbeats are up He’s rigid frozen in utter terror
Deep down somewhere in his psyche he knows what it is

It doesn’t look human

Because it isn’t

BEDFORD
(whisper )
Rosales Hector

Rosales’ eyes flutter open He groggily looks at a terrified
Bedford staring across the room

And follows Bedford’s gaze to the figure -- he instinctively
jerks back into the cabinets LOUD waking the others

ALEX
What

Alex sees it eyes grow huge

ALEX
Oh fuck

KELLY
What is that What is that

Kelly scurries backwards away from the intruder Bedford
moving her behind him

It still stands there not moving Watching

Then the figure shifts ever so slightly and moves
catching a bit of fleeting firelight

THE ALIEN
A good seven feet tall strange markings over its thick
wrinkled rhino-like skin Eyes black oval eyes and slits
where the nose should be Limbs twice as long in proportion
to its body Fingers each a foot long on multiple joints
curled into reversed fists Knees bend backwards disjointed
It’s body seems to ripple red with heat -- radiation
Bedford’s eyes never leave the figure
BEDFORD
(low)

Get to the door

They obey and step to the edge of the cubicles All they have
to do is cross the aisle to the door

But the alien follows their move mimicking each step that
they take Head turning eyes following our group

Bedford steps into the aisle between the group and the
figure He is calm unsettling so

BEDFORD
Behind me go

ALEX
David

BEDFORD
Go

Kelly Alex and Rosales move fast past Bedford across the
aisle to the door and get out

The figure’s attention shifts from the departing crewto
Bedford

HALLWAY

Kelly moves away fast with the others looking back seeing
her father isn’t there He’s still in the office

KELLY
Dad what are you doing Move

But Bedford isn’t moving

KELLY
You said youd fight You said
youd fight for me So do it

Bedford makes his move an all out sprint for the office
door for his daughter --

As the alien darts after him moving swiftly silently dead
fast --

Going to be close --

Kelly reaching her hand out for Bedford --

Bedford almost there --

The alien about to cut him off and --

Bedford barrels through the doorway hits the ground --

Rosales slamming the door shut Propping a chair against the
handle

Then nothing

They back away and --

BOOM The door is pounded from the other side
BOOM Again Wood splintering Inhuman strength
Something trying to break through

ROSALES
Let’s go Move

Bedford Kelly and Alex rush to Rosales holding the
stairwell door open

EXT STREET - NIGHT

They race out of the building running legs heavy slipping
in the dust hoisted up running some more

Not knowing what might be right in front of them They flinch
at every shadow and shaded patch of smoke

They take cover in the street With no lights anywhere the
city is near pitch black No sign they were followed

KELLY
W-what do we do What the hell
do we do

BEDFORD
Weve gotta run we’ve gotta run
now

KELLY
Where

ROSALES

West All the way to City Hall It
can’t be everywhere at once

ALEX
It’s too far We can’t make it

BEDFORD
We make it We run like Rosales
said Find the others
The walkie-talkies CRACKLE with pulsing static Building

KELLY
Oh Godit’sit’s coming

RINGING in their ears -- the air building up pressure and --
-- BOOM The air POPS and BURSTS --
The alien now standing right there between them --

Throwing our group through the air like an exploded land
mine

They hit the ground ears ringing heads pounding
disoriented

Separated

ROSALES

Is slow to his feet head pounding spots Alex nearby in the
dust He stumbles over to her heaves her up Blood from her

ears Legs wobbling

Focuses behind Rosales and SCREAMS Rosales whirls around to
witness

The alien standing right there

ROSALES
Christ

Rosales yanks Alex into motion moving away fast

BEDFORD

Comes to sprawled atop the hood of a car forehead bleeding
He rolls off to the ground stunned shaking his head to
clear it -- as if a bomb went off in his lap

Looking around realizes with dread

BEDFORD
Kelly

Is
DOWN THE BLOCK

Pressed against an alley wall terrified alone eyes wide
Kelly reaches for the walkie It’s gone

A ghostly disturbing SOUND comes closer

She presses harder against the wall trying to disappear into
it

The SOUND becoming clearer
CLICKING

Ever so slowly Kelly peeks her head around the corner of the
alley

The alien stands ten feet away back to her Searching

She shoots back behind the cover of the wall Only one
option

Kelly bolts charging down the block on Jello legs through
the smoke

She runs past a police car in the middle of the street
stops sliding in the dust goes back
INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT
Kelly jumps in the driver’s seat slams the door closed Keys
in the ignition Cranks it No go but the battery registers
dashboard lights dim
She lifts the radio mic presses the button

KELLY

Hello Can anyone hear me
Please

It makes no sound She looks around frantically presses all
the buttons

KELLY
Come on

The SIREN SQUEALS

The POLICE LIGHTS ON THE ROOF FLASH AND STROBE THE AREA RED
AND BLUE

Kelly is losing it Frantic

KELLY
Shitshitshit

She presses more buttons switches knobs The siren
thankfully TURNS OFF and the RADIO comes to life She fumbles
for it

EXT STREET CORNER

Without regard for his safety Bedford stumbles through the
street in the wide open eyes darting for his daughter

BEDFORD

Walkie-talkie blurs with voice Kelly’s voice

KELLY (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
-- hear me Someone

BEDFORD
(into walkie-talkie)
Kelly I got you I’m here Where

KELLY (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
A police car I don’t know Get me

Lock the doors and don’t move I’m

Bedford hurries down the street

INT POLICE CAR

Kelly drops the radio Resounded to her fate

KELLY
Hurry

She locks the doors goes to roll up the open front windows
then notices there aren’t any Blown out Shit

She quietly gets out and moves to the back door gets in

Windows intact and up doors locked and then she realizes a
metal barricade separates the back seat from the front

And the radio

KELLY
No

Kelly reaches for the door handle but there aren’t any in
the back of a police car

KELLY

Ohfuckohfuckohfuck Shit Fuck

you Kelly Fuck you
She shakes with fear and cries dried up tears
Locked in the back of the police car Curling up on the seat
Fetal
EXT STREET
Halfway there the walkie CRACKLES STATIC PULSES intently
Bedford freezes next to an abandoned van on the cusp
looking down the street to the police car and it’s flashing
red lights
So close
Suddenly the side door of the van slides open -- hands reach
out -- grab Bedford cover his mouth pulling him in --
INT VAN
Bedford struggles to get free sees his kidnapper -- Rosales
and Alex hiding in the back of the van Rosales slides the

door closed

ROSALES
It’s us Calm down

BEDFORD
Kellyshe’s out there

ALEX
We know we can see her

BEDFORD
Where

Alex points to the van’s side bubble window Everything
distorted and fish-eyed through it the police car visible

ROSALES
It’s close I heard it

Bedford moves to the door unlocks it Rosales stops him

ROSALES
What are you doing

ALEX
Wait a minute--

BEDFORD
Fuck you wait a minute That’s my

ROSALES
Going to what You go running wild

of you Think about your girl
Right now she’s hidden safe

ALEX
He’s right We wait for it to pass

BEDFORD
And if it doesn’t

ROSALES
Then well act

Holding up the shotgun Bedford knows he’s right He wants to
lash out to scream

ALEX
Do you want me to tell her

BEDFORD
No I’m her dad I’1l do it

Walkie-talkies scream loud and fast with PULSING STATIC AND
SOLE CLICKING

BEDFORD
(into walkie-talkie)
Kelly Look We can’t get there

BEDFORD (CONTD)
Don’t move It’s coming up on you

Kelly
No reply
ALEX
Why isn’t she responding
BEDFORD
Nosomething’s wrong
ROSALES
Once it passes we’ll get her We

will
A RHYTHMICAL CLICKING SOUND is heard from outside

ALEX
It’s out there

Bedford moves next to Alex and they look
OUT THE BUBBLE WINDOW

Shadows move in the smoke Then something appears
Something long and thin haloed by the dust

It passes slowly movements unnatural heading in the
direction of the
INT POLICE CAR

Three feet visibility outside in the smoke lit in bursts of
red and blue from the lights above

BEDFORD (ON RADIO)
Kelly if you can hear thisit’s
coming to you Hide baby okay
Hide and don’t move

Kelly lies down on the floor in the back seat of the squad
car breathing heavily shaking

CLICKING from outside closer

She whimpers desperately trying to be quiet trying not to
breath

POLICE LIGHTS FLASH

A dark shape becomes visible out the rear window A mere line
of shadow

Closer Almost floating
Disappearing into the atmosphere
Lights flash Closer

Kelly stops breathing listens
The shape becomes clearer

Kelly slowly turns around and looks out the window Theres
nothing there now She turns and looks out the front as --

A dark shape whips past

Fuck She jerks away into the seat back and CRIES out in
terror

She kicks and bangs on the door the glass the metal grate

INT VAN

They can only listen to the muffled cries of Kelly from
outside Rosales blocking Bedford’s exit

KELLY (0S)
(crying)
Help me Help me Help me

There is nothing they can do and it’s killing them

INT POLICE CAR

Kelly hyperventilates Her face transforms from fear into
anger then rage

CRACK She kicks at the window It spiderwebs

CRACK again It shatters out

She struggles through the opening squeezing through cutting
herself on the shards of glass

EXT CITY STREETS

She falls out of the car staggers up and runs blindly She
looks behind and sees the figure watching

KELLY
Oh God help me

A BURST of air in front of her

She stops fast sliding in the dust tripping an inch away
from infection rolling away ears ring and --

The alien isrightthere

Kelly - frozen in place to scared to move to breath
Shaking uncontrollably

As another figure appears behind the alien With a shotgun
And a smile COCKING it loudly

Rosales
BOOM He fires the alien jerks back
BOOM Again Alien moved farther away

ROSALES
Now Get her

Bedford rushes up to Kelly hoisting her up as Alex runs to
the police car grabs the gun inside to aid Rosales when

ROSALES
Help him

Alex sees Bedford struggle with Kelly rushes over and
together hoist her and get her away

Rosales keeps the gun on the alien BOOM

Alex and Bedford race around behind the van place Kelly
down Alex kneels over checks her vitals

BEDFORD
How is she

ALEX
Okay She’s okay Just shock Keep
her warm

Bedford takes off his jacket wrapping it around his
daughter

BEDFORD
Where’s Rosales

ALEX
He’s still out there

BOOM Another shotgun blast in the distance

ROSALES

Is on the offensive The alien is taking hit after hit
Cocking shell ejected FIRING

The alien down to a knee now
Cocking FIRING

The alien not going withstand another blast Rosales moving
in for the kill

Cocking

CLICK Empty

Oh shit

He cocks it again Another click Out of ammo

And then the alien slowly rises to its full height diffused
in the smoke and dust Seven feet tall

Roles reversed
BOOM A massive air burst right in front of Rosales
He’s jarred violently and thrown backwards into the air

BOOM Another burst from behind breaks his back and he falls
to the street like a rag doll

He lies immobile paralyzed eyes blinking away a tear
That moves laterally into the smoke
toward the alien approaching him

He tries to get away to fight back but he can’t move can’t
scream His eyes strain to see

The alien moves with balletic movements shrouded

Hands materialize out of the smoke blending into the
environment

Elongated deformed fingers a foot long crawl up his clothes
like spiders

making contact with his skin --

THE OTHERS

Can see Rosales through the gap under the van He takes the
brunt of the infection to the face Body spasms violently
steaming as the alien crouches over him

Watching the infection spread

Then alien’s head whips around fast to face our group -- then
dead still

They run

EXT CITY HALL - NIGHT

The large formidable building is surrounded by a barricade
of garbage trucks and saw horses A few fires burn here and
there but otherwise empty and quiet

Bedford supporting Kelly and Alex sprint to the building
to the front doors

INT CITY HALL

Moving fast -- through the deserted building -- turning
corners -- hallway to hallway -- following the signs for

“Bomb Shelter”

Reaching a small set of stairs leading down toward the
basement

The sign above an arrow pointing down They descend

INT CITY HALL BASEMENT

Reaching the bottom of the stairs At the end of the long
corridor is a single imposing steel door stamped with
fallout shelter signs

Again there are no people down here No voices

KELLY
They’re all in there

ALEX
Yeah it’s a bit quite

BEDFORD
They’re just hiding is all

As they inch forward Bedford catches a peculiar odor in the
air and recoils

BEDFORD
(sniffs)
Smells like acid
Alex smells it too

ALEX
Ammonia

They walk to the door where the smell seems to emanate from

KELLY
Dad

BEDFORD
Yeah

KELLY

Theres some weird stuff down here

BEDFORD
Yeah

The ground is scattered with a few bags a stroller a shoe
a photo album

Bedford shines his flashlight ahead

Metal pipes on the wall dissolve into pipes of human flesh
It glistens in the light One can almost taste the stench of
old ammonia

A brownout glow ahead Eyes widen in alarm

BEDFORD
Wait

Kelly doesn’t listen and pushes past hobbling fast throwing
open the steel door

BEDFORD
Kelly

Bedford runs after her The tunnel opens up into

INT FALLOUT SHELTER

Brown-out light flickers the shelter from rows of fluorescent
lights that hang askew White Doric pillars support the
ceiling like skeletal bones Guns and spent ammo lie
scattered about

They’ve found the SURVIVORS -- Hundreds of them

ALEX
No

They cover the floor in a vast pulsating heap like one
giant heartbeat

Heads limbs and bodies are still seen fused with the mounds
dissolving mutating Faces protrude out frozen in silent
screams from the mounds of flesh

They can only stare at the carnage There is a sudden flash
of revelation that soon the worst the incredible the thing
one would not believe to the very last moment is bound to
happen

All the continually nursed illusions all the brittle
hopes collapse

Kelly instinctively covers his mouth and nose from the
rotting smell

Too weak to stand Alex collapses to the ground and lowers
her head

Bedford is drawn to a nearby table piled high with radios
microphones computers video cameras flares flashlights
maps tacked to the wall showing Los Angeles -- blocked and
destroyed roads and bridges hospitals police stations --
all “X”ed out in red marker

And LEAFLETS

Stacked high most having spilled off onto the floor Bedford
picks one up reads it Hope returning

BEDFORD
The ocean

ALEX
What

BEDFORD

This wasn’t the end this place It
was just a way-station where they
sent out that message we heard

KELLY
They’re all dead
BEDFORD
No We were wrong they do know

they are coming

ALEX
Who What are you talking about

BEDFORD
The National Guard The goddamn US
Army That’s what I’m talking
about

He shoves the leaflets into their hands and we finally see
it

“ATTENTION -NATIONAL EMERGENCY

INT CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The group is upstairs out of the room of death The map from
the wall in the shelter is now spread out on the floor and
they are huddled around using a flashlight to illuminate it

Flares from the shelter and new walkie-talkies are stacked
next to them Alex shoves a handgun into her waistband
pockets bullets Armed along with Bedford and the shotgun

BEDFORD
We’re here
(indication on map)
Closest port is this one in Santa
Monica

KELLY
How far is that

BEDFORD
About five miles We can take
Wilshire all the way there A
straight line

KELLY
We won’t make it that far

BEDFORD
We’1l have to

ALEX
It’s another major street We’d be
better off with side roads

BEDFORD
It’ll take twice the time

Kelly is studying the map intently

KELLY
What if we don’t take any street

BEDFORD
We can’t stay here Kelly --

KELLY
That’s not what I meant

She points to the map -- to blue lines that run along the
roads bisecting And the map legend -- the Blue Line
indicated

SEWER SYSTEM

EXT CITY HALL REAR ALLEY - NIGHT

ON cement sewer grate on the pavement stamped with a picture
of a dolphin reading

“No Dumping Sewer Drains Directly To Oceans

Bedford pries it open shines the flashlight down A ladder
descends into darkness Alex keeps lookout

ALEX
Day wouldn’t be complete without
another trip underground eh

Bedford smirks He lights a flare drops it down
illuminating the bottom some thirty feet below

KELLY
What do you think

BEDFORD
Looks alright

Bedford climbs down followed by Kelly and then Alex taking
the rear sliding the grate closed above him

As disembodied FOOTPRINTS edge closerleaving tracks in the
dust

INT SEWER TUNNELS
Dank dark creepy No electricity to feed the lights

ECHOING FOOTSTEPS getting closer A beam of light sweeps the
dusty air of the underground tunnel system

Bedford’s weakening flashlight guides their way illuminating
dirty gravel graffiti a pile of cat and rat skeletons the
walls coated in grime

Alex holding the map to guide her hurrying down the tunnels
with Bedford pulling Kelly behind

ALEX
Here This way

Kelly checks the walkie-talkie FAINT STATIC No noise no
survivors

KELLY
I can’t hear them anymore I can’t
get them

BEDFORD

You can’t hear them because we’re
underground No signal down here
But trust me they’re out there
Waiting for us

INT TUNNEL STAIRWELL
They move slowly down slick stairs weening with lethargy

ALEX
Almost therea little further

And they keep going one step at a time Kelly hangs on to
her father eyes vacant

BEDFORD
We’re almost there The Pacific
Ocean Water fresh air Can you
see it It’s all there just a few
more steps

Bedford holds onto her She looks at him sees the resolve on
his face

BEDFORD
We’1ll make it

SOUNDS ECHO down the tunnels behind getting closer

ANOTHER TUNNEL
They move past pipes and girders working their way down a
steep incline to a dark abandoned
INT LOCKER ROOM
Used for streets and sanitation workers A bank of dented
metal lockers A forest of copper tubing and pipes where
sinks used to be
Alex locks the metal door behind them And they slow to a
stop staring ahead where their light bounces off the wall
The end of the sewer
DEAD END
Alex studies the map with building anxiety
ALEX

This isn’t right No They must

have filled it inor we made a

wrong turn somewhere I don’t know

She closes his eyes and struggles to get the words out

ALEX
We have to go back

Kelly leans against the wall and closes her eyes Nothing is
said between them each in their own separate worlds

Bedford paces slams a frustrated fist into the lockers
jarring them slightly out of place leans against them

Then

A FAINT CREAK from the other side of the bolted door

They look Could be anything wind tunnels settling
Silence

They back away to the middle of the room Their eyes shift
fried Stock still like a submarine crew awaiting the blast
of a depth charge

It happens again They freeze listen

More CREAKS closer and something else

A RHYTHMIC SHUFFLE in the hall approaching the door

FOOTSTEPS

Bedford slowly approaches the door Quiet shaky steps He
leans forward and listens with his ear close to the metal

Definitely footsteps Slow soft scuffingcoming closer
closer

Right outside the door now

The footsteps don’t pause They pass the door and move on
Thank God

BEDFORD
(whispers )
It’s moving away
Bedford listens at the door strains for the next sound

And then it happens FOOTSTEPS coming back

They stop directly outside the door A little light
underneath the door shows the shadow of deformed feet

The door CREAKS with the weight of something leaning against
it from the other side

SCRATCHING NOISES from outside on the door
Then the knob turns slowly Stops
Rattling someone trying to get in

A beat

A BOOMING THUD makes the door shudder

Raw frenzied POUNDING AND SCRATCHING follows something
inhuman determined to break through

Bedford throws his weight against the door keeping it
closed

Alex keeps Kelly back behind her away from impending death
that wants in

It’s Kelly who notices it first
KELLY
(to Alex)

Your hairit’s moving

And so it is a slight breeze behind her coming from the
wall of lockers

Alex moves to them and bends to feel a steady current of air
coming through from beneath
ALEX
Wind There’s something behind
this
Alex examines the footing of the lockers with the flashlight

The metal surface of the door suddenly buckles and bulges
Two of the hinges come loose

BEDFORD
Hurry

ALEX
Kelly give me a hand

Alex braces her legs and tries to push the whole bank of
lockers clear Kelly joins and togetherstruggling and --

The lockers tip and fall with an ENORMOUS BANG which echoes
loudly off the walls Dust flies everywhere

When it settles the flashlight illuminates the area of the
wall where the lockers once stood now a LARGE HOLE

A PASSAGEWAY
ALEX
(smiles)

I knew it

WHAM The door to the stairs bulges outward as something
SMASHES against it again and again Frenzied SCRATCHING

It isn’t going to hold
BAM A tremendous SHATTERING sound

BEDFORD
Let’s go

Kelly and Alex scurry into the hole Bedford dashes behind
them
INT NARROW SHAFT

They pull themselves along the three-foot diameter shaft
slow painful claustrophobic

A gate blocks the exit of the shaft

BEDFORD
Hold this

Bedford hands Alex the flashlight and begins to KICK at the
gate trying to tear it free

Alex hears the CLICKING She shines the light back down the
shaft to the hole they entered through --

Light is dimmed and blocked out behind them at the shaft’s
entrance

THE ALIEN STANDS THERE AND WATCHES

INT TUNNELS

The gate is kicked out Bedford Kelly and Alex fall out of
the narrow shaft Bedford SLAMS the lid back on the hole
gets to his feet and runs with the others

HOLD ON the lid

WHAM It bursts from the wall rolls away like a coin

Our group sprinting down the tunnel

CLANG Metal pipes are jarred with the unnatural movements of
the alien as it moves fast down the narrow tunnel behind
them

Alex FIRING the handgun behind as she goes

Bedford looks around frantically He crosses to a METAL LID
on the floor lifts it

A HOLE is below dropping off into darkness

BEDFORD
Here Down here

The alienss CLICKING grows louder

Kelly and Alex descend Bedford sits himself on the edge of
the hole grasping the metal lid by handles on its underside

The alien speeding toward him --
Bedford JUMPS into the hole hanging onto the lid --

WHANG The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a
second before the alien reaches it

INT PIPE GALLERY

Above the CLICKING of the alien scanning the lid from the
outside

The others are well below Bedford who gingerly searches for
footing as he scales down the network of pipes

Until his foot slips on the greasy metal
And he falls
Ricocheting off metal with bangs and thuds cartwheels down --

He CRASHES onto a juncture between two large PIPES catching
himself He MOANS in pain

KELLY (0S)
Dad Are you alright

Bedford hangs from a pipe his arms trembling and legs
dangling above a seemingly bottomless pit below crisscrossed
with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS

Then he hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above

The nearest pipe above him is well beyond reach He’s
trapped

CLOSER - BEDFORD

His strength gives out He closes his eyes lets go and
drops

INT UNDERGROUND JUNKYARD

Falling crashing into a pile of junk dampening his fall
Finding themselves in a large vaulted room A sort of
underground junkyard -- a place where sewer trash has been
rounded up and piled in large heaps

Kelly rushing up

KELLY
Are you okay

Then a hollow CLANG CLANG CLANG from above

Bedford stares upward He reaches out to his fallen
flashlight shakes it on

It shines on the maze of pipes and into the pitch-black
above
And for a split second the light illuminates
The Alien
Climbing down the pipes toward them CLANG CLANG CLANG

BEDFORD
Run RUN

They hurry through walking across a floor of rotted-out
planks of wood creaking with every step stunting their
forward progress

Passing large gaps in the wood floor that trail down into
darkness below staggering intense with fear

Dust drizzles down from above -- Light slants in weakly from
overhead grates above three stories up

Then Alex spots it across the room

A DOOR AN EMERGENCY EXIT SIGN

THE WAY OUT

When -- the Alien lands in the room CLICKING listening
sensing Eyeing the group

And then it drops below beneath a gap in the floorboards
Silence Where the hell is it

Bedford looks around to find it He hears FEET SCURRYING
toward him punctuated by a metallic CLANG CLANG CLANG

KELLY
Oh God

ALEX
Where is it

Bedford shakes his head - no clue

BEDFORD
Keep moving

As dark sickly hands slow rise out from one of the gaps

And grab onto Alex’s ankles

She’s pulled down the wood breaking beneath her hanging
onto a beam
Bedford races over reaches out a hand grabbing her

BEDFORD
Hang on I got you
Alexs body jerks and heaves as she’s yanked - like a seal
struggling to fend off a shark beneath the surface -
desperately trying to hang on

The wood around Bedford now starts to CRACK AND SPLIT
threatening to take everyone down

Hands slipping and --

ALEX
I’m sorry

Then -- WHAM Alex is thrust down
And just like that she’s gone

KELLY
NO

Bedford pulls Kelly toward the emergency exit door
everything numb

As he opens the door the light of morning flooding in and
overtaking them just like their exodus from the subways
INT LOWER SEWERS

ON ALEX Eyes closed out like a light And her sweat
defying gravity dripping upwards

Her eyes pop open darting around and we realize along with
Alex herself that she is hanging upside down helpless

Her foot caught in the rung of a ladder knee dislocated on
the trapped leg

Gun on the ground below
She tries to bend up feel her knee get free but has no
strength left She falls back and YELLS in fierce pain

unbearable

Alex remembers fumbles for the walkie-talkie It slips out
of her hand falls to the ground and clicks on

IT EXPLODES WITH PULSING STATIC AND NOISE

She looks into the darkened tunnels everything upside-down
in her sight

A flash of movement a WHISPER OF SOUND

Where is it Was it real or in her head She can’t tell
anymore

She listens hard everything straining to hear
CLICKING It’s in the room with her

She gathers the strength bends up reaches out and dislodges
her foot--

Falls hard to the ground back first air knocked out of her
Eyes flick back and forth looking terrified

Puffs of dust on the floor before her getting closer
--FOOTSTEPS

She thrusts herself backwards against the wall A glimmer in
the corner of her eyes

The gun
Just Out Of Reach Inches from her fingers
Footprints walking toward her

Struggling ever closer she gets a grip on the gun One
bullet left

The footprints are right before her now and --

She makes her choice just like Sarge taught her putting the
barrel into her mouth closing her eyes tight and --

CLICK She opens her eyes still here alive Growing
frantic pulling the trigger repeatedly -- and nothing The
gun just won’t fire

But Bedford’s will

As he lowers behind the alien and FIRES hitting it square in
the leg dropping it

And runs to Alex putting her arm around his neck hoisting
her up Alex grimacing in pain on her bum knee

Pulling her toward the hole he dropped down from where Kelly
appears reaching her hand down

KELLY
Hurry It’s getting back up

Behind them the alien rising

Bedford lifts Alex who grabs onto Kelly’s hand pulling
herself up

And Bedford tossing the gun up then jumping struggling
pulling his body up and over the ledge --

Just as the alien rises turning to look at him and we --

CUT TO

EXT SANTA MONICA STREET - MORNING

ON A SEWER GRATE Fingers come up through the gaps lift up
the grate and push it aside

Alex crawls out onto the surface street exhausted Kelly
close behind then Bedford

The ocean a half mile away closer than ever forward
movement when Bedford stops hearing that faint but resonant
lament

Alex and Kelly turn to him

KELLY
What are you doing Let’s go

BEDFORD
(sotto)
We’re not going to make it

And Bedford looks down at the shotgun in his hand And up at
his daughter And there’s a tacit exchange she doesn’t want
him to go but knows he must

BEDFORD
Go I’ll catch up

KELLY
Daddy

BEDFORD
If something goes wrong you get to
your mother’s house and seal it up
I’1l see you there

Said with such conviction that she believes him for a minute
the little girl nowhere to be found when she says

KELLY
Kill that fucking thing

He nods Gestures for them to go - watching as they flee to
the west waiting until their shapes are no longer visible in
the thinning smoke

We stay on David all semblance of conviction melting from
his face (what we see is obligation) as his eyes focus to
his right on a deserted grocery store -- covered in warning
sings

“CAUTION LEAD PAINT”

Just like the subway tunnel The edge Bedford just may need

INT GROCERY STORE

SERIES OF IMAGES

- Bedford transverses the aisles searching piling supplies
into a shopping cart -- kerosene lamps batteries hairspray
butane and lighter fluid and boxes of baking powder

- Shoving shelves rolling them rearranging them

- Moving backwards as he sifts the baking powder across the
floor

- Spraying the contents of a bottle of lighter fluid on the
shelves of rotten food spraying hairspray over them He
tosses it aside landing on a pile of dozens more

LATER

ON BEDFORD’S FACE as he lights a match before his face
flames reflected in his eyes

And then he tosses it before him

It hits the flammable liquids and goes up in FLAMES
spreading out from him revealing the new store

The shelves have been rearranged so that they block out all
aisles and entrances save for the front door as the flames
lick across them

A path from that front door directly to a lone metal chair
where he sits The floor now coated in powder

And Bedford dead emotionless eyes staring at the open door

BEDFORD
(sotto)
Come on you sonofabitch
Waiting
LATER

And waiting Time crawling by Something’s wrong

Bedford stands slowly walks to the door stepping around the
powder on the floor and looks out Nothing

He goes back to the chair to wait Leg shaking impatient
Except

He doesn’t see the section of ceiling moving directly above
him

-and the shape moving out
Dust sprinkles down

Bedford sees this his leg going still along with the rest
of him

As his eyes move up
To the alien In the ceiling

He dives out of the way as the alien lands in the room
crushing the chair he was just sitting in

FIRE spreading an inferno

Bedford’s feet slide out from under him shotgun skipping
away He scrambles crawls to it spins toward the alien and--

It isn’t there

Bedford’s head swivels around frantically Where is it
And then he sees itthose footprintsapproaching
BOOM He unleashed a devastating blast from the shotgun
Black blood oozes from dozens of small holes in the alien

It runs down its face and body outlining its figure A
frightening sight

But it keeps coming blood dripping to the floor in its
wake

Bedford gets to his feet backpedals to the manager’s office
door locked Slams it but it won’t budge

The alien nearing

Bedford’s trapped then he spots a service elevator to his
left Races to it claws it open hurrying in but

The elevator isn’t there

He falls down the shaft and --

INT ELEVATOR

CRASHES through the emergency escape of the elevator
SLAMMING to the floor bones cracking YELLING out in intense
pain

Half the ceiling comes down with him metal and wood smashing
around him

And he just lays there unable to move looking up

As the alien’s head peeks through the opening down at
Bedford

And then it comes crawling down the shaft

THE ALIEN IS BETWEEN HIM AND THE END OF IT ALL ONE WAY OR
ANOTHER IT ENDS HERE

Bedford gropes around the debris around him for anything to
defend himself never taking his eyes off the alien who has
reached an impasse -- an opening in the elevator shaft
leading to another lower floor

Bedford finds what he was looking for his fingers closing
around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE

He looks up and --

THE ALIEN releases itself from the shaft wall falling
headed right at Bedford and --

Bedford still frighteningly so and --
The alien shooting down at him and --

At the last second Bedford rolls holding the metal pipe
vertically where he was just at and --

STABS THE PIPE into the aliens chest with a wet CRRK

The alien hits the ground right next to him sending dust up
into the air impaled on the pipe Gushing blood out of its
wound

Bedford doesn’t wait He heaves himself up to his knees
Extracting the pole from the dying alien he strikes it over
and over with deadly sickly CRACKS He pounds away lashing
out blow after ugly blow as black blood splatters and sprays
out of the enemy

Unrelenting Savage The pole bends with the force

He stops exhausted breathing heavily

He is the embodiment of screaming desperation a broken shell
of the man who set out

Finding something finally worth fighting for

The pries open the doors stumbling into the sub basement
Taking out a flare igniting it --

The alien still moving still alive
-- And tosses the flare into the elevator -- up in flames

CUT TO

EXT SUBURBAN STREET

Bedford hobbles through the dusty air on weak injured legs
in incredible pain finding the strength and will to get home

His eyes wander hard to focus hard to see He holds onto
the now silent walkie

BEDFORD
KellyAlexhear me

No response

He climbs over rubble and trips to the ground He CRIES OUT
in pain rolls onto his back fighting through the pain to
stay conscious

BEDFORD
Get up
(beat pained)
GET UP

He stares up in a daze at the
SKY
A parting in the clouds reveal a blue sky

Bisecting the blue in crisscross patterns are HUNDREDS OF
RIPPLING HEAT VAPOR TRAILS

As we pan down to a new location

EXT SANTA MONICA PIER - DAWN

Making it to the pier Bedford stops hope draining as he
stares out at the ocean

PULL BACK to reveal the beach keeps going and going

Cliffs and dunes of sanddead carcasses of fish and sea
lifea grounded oil tanker

WIDE - OCEAN
IT ISNT THERE
Not for miles and miles away

WHAT WATER IS LEFT FLOATS UPWARD INTO THE HEAVENS LIKE UPSIDE-
DOWN RAIN

It moves toward the fading crisscrossed heat vapors in the
sky -- massive hovering alien tankers

It’s the end of the world and it’s almost beautiful

Bedford expressionless like someone risen from the dead
Eyes cold and hollow glittering blankly

As he realizes what it was all about the radiation the
aliens why they came the empty bottles and dried up food
the dust

What they were after

Earth’s biggest natural resource worth more than anything
else in the universe the building block and sustaining force
of life

THE WATER

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BEACH HOUSE - DAY

Small full of colorful paint The mailbox reading HARRIET
KELLY BEDFORD

INT BEACH HOUSE

Bedford moving through searching calling out

BEDFORD
Kelly Alex

Getting no response They’re not here
ON THE WALKIE-TALKIE in Bedford’s hand Dead silent as --

A shadow moves up behind himhis hand tightening on the
shotgunspins aims -- stops

KELLY stands in the hallway Tears streaming down her face

KELLY
You came back for me

BEDFORD
Told you I would

Running into her father’s arms Bedford wrapping her up
tight

As Alex steps in behind Bedford nodding his thanks to her
entrusting Alex with his most prized possession And she
smiles nodding back

EXT PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

Abandoned cars litter the highway stretching up the coast
The air is cleaner the dust lighter

David and Kelly stand looking out at the ocean or what’s
left of it

KELLY
They’re gone

And in fact they are The massive alien floating oil tankers
are no longer hovering above the waters now receded fifty
miles from the beach

BEDFORD
They took what they wanted and
left

KELLY
Why leave any water behind at all

BEDFORD
So one day earth would replenish
itself and they could come back

ALEX
What do we do now

Bedford looks north toward the mountains peeking out of the
clouds and their white tipped peaks

BEDFORD
There’s still snow up there If
there’s snow then there’s water
And where there’s water --

KELLY
There’s life

Bedford puts his arm around his daughter keeping her near
keeping her safe Alex holding her hand

As they begin the laborious unknown journey to new land and a
new beginning

FADE OUT
