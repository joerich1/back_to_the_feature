FRIDA and JENNIFER walk down the sidewalk together Frida is
mousy and frumpy She wears glasses and has her hair tightly
pulled back into a ponytail She wears baggy drab clothes --
has no fashion sense and wears flat sensible shoes
Jennifer on the other hand is trendy stylish and sexy
Shes a head-turner Men check out Jennifer and ignore Frida

FRIDA

asshole he cheated he borrowed
money and never paid it back hes
never had a regular job

FRIDA
Hes a very talented musician

JENNIFER
Every woman at some point has to
date a musician I wish youd get
rid of Mark for good Every time

when you were going out

FRIDA
I guess I have a weakness for him
Its those big brown Bambi eyes

JENNIFER
So dont look in his eyes

Two guys passing by on the street check out Jennifer One of
them stops in front of her

GUY

She rolls her eyes and walks around the gawking guy Frida
and Jennifer continue walking in silence for a moment

FRIDA
I wonder what its like being you

Another guy gawking at Jennifer isnt watching where hes
going and bumps smack into Frida

restaurant Its called Coyote Ugly Saloon

INT RESTAURANTTABLE - NIGHT

Jennifer sits between GEORGE and CARLTON who both lean in
hanging on her every word Theyre all having steak

JENNIFER

So I asked the bartender what
coyote ugly meant Its like the
bagger system You know a two-
bagger -- someone so ugly that you
need two bags -- one bag to put on
their head and another one in case
it blows off Or a three-bagger

GEORGE
Two bags for them and one bag for

your head in case her two fall off

Jennifer George and Carlton laugh

JENNIFER
But coyote ugly well its so
totally offensive its when a

guy wakes up with a girl sleeping
on his arm He looks over and
shes so ugly that he chews through
his own arm to get away from her

Carlton and George crack up Too much

PULL BACK to reveal Frida also sitting at the table though a
bit apart from the other three picking meekly at her salad

JENNIFER

Frida looks up from her plate of leaves

FRIDA
Sorry I guess I wasnt listening

at Frida Jennifer puts her fork down and clears her throat

JENNIFER

INT VICTORIAS SECRET - DAY

Chaos Hardly the relaxed atmosphere Jennifer described
Though there is indeed classical music playing

CUT TO an overhead shot of a huge circular bin of womens
underpants and another bin of bras All different colors

Various womens hands pick frantically through the bins
looking for the right size and color Sometimes hands grab at
the same one simultaneously The atmosphere seems hectic

WOMAN 1
Give me that You aint a D cup

WOMAN 2
If youre a D cup Im Pamela
Anderson

increasing fervor Fridas hand grabs a pair of blue panties

FRIDA
Jennifer I got a medium

As Frida pulls the pair of panties out of the pile she
realizes an OLIVE-SKINNED WOMAN is grabbing the other end of
the panties They have a bit of a tug of war over it

OLIVE WOMAN
Thats mine

FRIDA
No I had it first

The tug of war continues Frida and the Olive Woman both
refuse to let go It looks like theyre about to rip when the
Olive Womans head comes into frame -- the back of her head
fills the frame with brunette curls Frida screams

FRIDA
OUCH

EXT STREET - DAY

doctor That can be dangerous
George bit me once and I had to go
to the emergency room

Frida looks at Jennifer uncomfortably Jennifer smiles to
herself reminiscing

INT DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY
Frida sits wearing a white hospital gown on an examining

table Shes bored as there isnt much to look at and its
cold in there -- especially in the skimpy gown

She goes to a mirror and puts on chapstick She smacks her
lips as Jennifer had in after putting on lipstick

Suddenly the door opens and nearly hits her Frida backs up
embarrassed as a male DOCTOR in a white coat walks in He

barely looks at Frida and stares at his clipboard

DOCTOR
A bite Whered you get bitten

FRIDA
At Victorias Secret

The doctor looks up from his clipboard confused

FRIDA
There was a sale

DOCTOR
I mean where on your body

FRIDA
Oh on my wrist

She holds it up for him to see He takes a look at it

DOCTOR
A dog at Victorias Secret

FRIDA
No it was another woman

The doctor seems skeptical He examines her wrist closer

DOCTOR
findmoviescriptscom

This doesnt look human Did she
wear dentures or damn this is
the oddest bite Ive ever seen

The doctor makes a note on his clipboard

DOCTOR
Hows the rest of your health

FRIDA
Good Except for PMS

The doctor resists the temptation to roll his eyes

DOCTOR
PMS What symptoms are you
experiencing

FRIDA

Its hard to describe I get
really bloated and irritable and
emotional and depressed and

DOCTOR
Thats just part of being a woman
Diet and exercise should help
Avoid salt sugar starches
caffeine alcohol

FRIDA
What else is there

DOCTOR
And keep a journal of your symptoms
to make sure its related to your
period and not just in your head

FRIDA
Its not just in my head

The doctor snaps his folder shut and heads for the door

DOCTOR
Ill send a nurse in to clean that
bite and give you a tetanus shot
And a rabies shot just in case

scratches herself She notices her nails are surprisingly

long She stares at them confused then opens the cat food

FRIDA
Sammy Seafood Feast

Frida sniffs the cat food as though it smells good to her
She nearly eats some -- then shakes her head realizing it was
a crazy thought She stands up and sniffs around her kitchen

She searches the cupboards Then the refrigerator Its full
of fruit and vegetables The other cupboard has healthy stuff
as well Frida slams the cupboard shut Obviously not

finding what shes looking for

A MONTAGE with jump cuts as Frida paces in circles She clips
her fingernails and toenails which are quite long and thick

She goes to the refrigerator opens the door looks in and
closes the door She does this several times as if its
contents will change the next time she opens it

She paces faster and faster in a tighter circle She feels
claustrophobic in her clothes and practically rips them off

INT GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Frida hurriedly shoves several chocolate bars in her basket
which is filled with junk food (frozen yogurt chocolate-
covered pretzels Doritos) a box of tampons and some Midol

Hersheys kisses She looks up and sees BRUNO an intriguing-
looking man They make eye-contact and he smiles at her
Frida is nervous but flattered She heads for the cashier

EXT GROCERY STORESTREET - NIGHT

We see Frida walking from behind Were in the POV of someone
whos following her Then CU Frida as she continues walking
holding her grocery bags She senses someone following her
and spins around to look

She sees Bruno walking behind her She smiles a tad and then
turns back around and keeps walking She hears Brunos pace
quicken and she quickens her own

We see Frida from Brunos POV as he speeds up and is gaining
on her What started out as a briefly sexy moment has
suddenly become kind of scary CU on Frida walking fast We
hear her heart beating fast Bruno catches up to her -- hes
right behind her Frida can hear him breathing hard

findmoviescriptscom

Frida spins around and stares at Bruno Her normally blue
yes look oddly bright -- like theyre orange She swipes at
the Brunos face with her fingernails and slashes him He
jumps back in pain and covers his face

BRUNO
Jesus Christ

He pulls his hand from his face to reveal large bloody
scratches on his cheek He looks up at Frida but shes gone

She looks around squinting -- the light hurts her eyes Her
apartments in disarray -- furniture moved around She sits
up and puts her bathrobe on realizing its ripped

FRIDA
Sammy

Frida gets up and notices the cat food dish is empty She
opens a can of cat food The cats nowhere to be seen

INT FRIDAS BATHROOM - DAY

Frida looks in the mirror She examines her arms and legs and
thinks they look hairy They look fine but shes obsessed
She has a quick flash in which they look hairier but then
theyre normal again Is it all in her head

Frida leans closer to the mirror and scrutinizes her face and
mustache area She then opens the medicine cabinet and
finds some Neet liquid hair remover and turns on the shower

INT FRIDAS BEDROOM - DAY

Frida takes a brand new bra out of her Victorias Secret
shopping bag She puts on the bra -- its clearly too tight
She adjusts the straps to no avail -- shes still bulging out
She pulls on a shirt and blazer

Frida grabs her coat and briefcase and leaves As soon as she
shuts the door the cat comes out and goes to its food dish

EXT PARK BENCH - DAY
findmoviescriptscom

Frida sits in the sunshine eating chocolate pudding like
theres no tomorrow as she reads a script She wears tennis
shoes with her suit She feels a little hot and unbuttons the
top few buttons of her blouse

GREGORY a tall good-looking guy in a suit stands casting
his shadow on her Frida is startled for a moment She looks
up at him looming over her but hes hard to see since the sun
is right behind him

have the nice brown eyes Frida mentioned earlier He carries

a McDonalds bag and is eating a French fry

He pushes his way past her and into the apartment

MARK

He shoves aside some of the makeup and puts down his
McDonalds bag on the table

FRIDA
Jennifers giving me a makeover

Mark takes a burger out of the bag and unwraps it Frida
sniffs at the burger

MARK
What you got a date or somethin

FRIDA
Since when do you care

Frida lustily eyes the burger Mark sees her check it out

MARK
Sorry I know you hate the sight of

Mark looks at Frida for a moment -- for the first time really

since he barged in
findmoviescriptscom

MARK
You look different I mean you

FRIDA

MARK
You do though You look really

FRIDA

He walks closer to her Frida backs up

Mark moves in closer puts his arms around her and tries to
kiss her Frida turns her head away from his kiss She looks
down and sees the burger which sits on the table behind Mark

ECU of the burger looking delicious like in a commercial

Frida sniffs and makes a little moan -- shes completely
focused on the burger Mark thinks shes moaning for him and
he continues kissing her neck As he does Frida reaches
down picks up the burger and takes a huge bite out of it

CLOSE ON Fridas face as we see her sheer near-orgasmic
enjoyment of the burger Suddenly Mark jerks away

MARK
OUCH Shit What the fuck

He twists his arm to reach around to feel his back
Completely ignoring Marks pain Frida takes a few more chomps
of the burger as though she hasnt eaten in days

Mark lifts his shirt which is ripped He sees in the mirror
that his back has huge bleeding scratches on it

MARK
Look what you did

FRIDA
Oh my god Im sorry

MARK
Shit And youre eating my burger
You dont eat meat

FRIDA
I cant help it it smells so good

Frida finishes the burger with an enormous bite and then runs
into the bathroom and gets rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball

MARK
Fuck you have sharp nails
findmoviescriptscom

Frida dabs his scratches with the rubbing alcohol

MARK
OUCH that stings Damn what am I

wrapper and fries

MARK

Frida slams the door and locks it

INT FRIDAS APARTMENT - LATER

ECUs of Jennifer putting make-up on Frida

They each look at menus The entrees are listed from lighter
fair down to steaks CU of each menu item and its price
Frida does a double-take at her menu

Instead of seeing a dollar amount Frida reads it like this

Sex till youre sore

GREGORY
Man Im starving too I think Ill

findmoviescriptscom

And everyone knows if its a thin
envelope you dont get in right
So I get a thin envelope and I
wasnt even gonna open it I was
just gonna jump off a bridge
Cause it was Harvard or bust

Frida looks up momentarily as she rips off a particularly
tough piece of meat Her food is much more interesting than
her date Gregory blurs a bit into the background His voice
is slightly altered -- as now were hearing his subtext

GREGORY
Okay lets face it I got into
Harvard cause my dad donated
50000 I barely got a thousand
on my SATs and was kicked outta
prep school but hey thats life
I have a really small penis Which
is why I tell stories about how
great I am Im also losing my
hair and I have no interest ina
relationship I just want you to
like my screenplay idea but I do
expect you to fuck me later

The cameras still on Frida as shes eating She looks up at
Gregory again momentarily as he snaps back into focus

GREGORY
So there I was hanging from the
edge of a bridge when my mom said
Son you got into Harvard It
took three of them to pull me back
Frida keeps eating

GREGORY
Well whattdaya think

FRIDA
Thats great Highly original

Frida cleans her plate with her finger and licks it Gregory
stares at her Hes only half finished -- hes been busy
talking and shes been busy eating Frida eyes his half-
eaten steak and points at it with her fork

FRIDA
Are you gonna finish that
EXT FRIDAS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
Gregory is walking Frida home She gets her keys out

Gregory looks at her not sure if shes serious Then he
takes a step back and looks around to make sure no ones
watching He then unzips his pants and pees Frida has the
urge to laugh for a moment but then she holds it back

An awkward moment as Gregory takes a really long time to pee
He looks over at Frida once or twice and they exchange an
awkward glance Finally hes done and he zips up his pants

Frida and Gregory look at each other Fridas eyes seem to
glow She takes a step towards him Gregorys taken off
guard as Frida grabs him and kisses him

As the apartment door opens we see (in silhouette) Spencer
carrying Frida over the threshold as a groom would his bride
He then flips on the lights of his apartment and kicks the
door closed behind him Spencer is longhaired and sexy

Frida is dressed very seductively and wears a lot of makeup --
but she looks great Shes busty and curvy -- barely
recognizable from the frump of the first few scenes Frida
holds her hand up to block the light from her eyes

FRIDA
The lights bother my eyes Can we

A vicious attack From the darkness we see the silhouette of
a human figure with wolf-like features get up from the bed and
walk off Spencer is moaning

and turns on the light Hes all bloodied and can barely move
as he reaches for the phone As soon as he grabs the

always falls for

Mark goes to hug her and kiss her neck She sniffs him Then
sniffs him again more closely -- like a dog Mark giggles
Frida doesnt like what she smells

MARK
Do I smell Can I take a shower

He lifts his arms and sniffs his armpits

sudden Go take your shower

INT FRIDAS BEDROOM - DUSK 88

Mark puts his wallet watch and beeper on the dresser and

the mouth Hes taken off guard She then pushes him away

hears Mark singing muffled from the bathroom Fridas about
to lie back on the bed when Marks beeper goes off
findmoviescriptscom

She reaches up to the dresser for the beeper Its the kind

that has a message on it She presses the message button and
sees Mark you studmuffin last night was awesome See you

soon Sherry Frida puts down the beeper

She leans back on the bed and stares up at the ceiling Her
eyes are glowing

INT FRIDAS BATHROOM - DUSK

Mark steps in the shower and pulls the shower curtain closed
CU of the water coming out of the spout Mark suds his body
with soap and continues singing He starts even lightly
dancing in the shower -- looking vain and ridiculous

A blurry human figure with wolf-like features appears behind
the shower curtain -- but Mark has his back turned and doesnt
see it Then he hears a growl over the sound of the water
running Mark turns around and sees the figure

Then we see from the wolf-figures POV an attack on Mark
Reminiscent of the shower scene from Psycho

After the attack the blurry wolfish figure runs off and the
camera stays on Mark as he slumps to the ground We zoom in

on his eye and on the bloody water going down the drain
Dissolve from the eye to a full moon and then back to the eye

Camera dollies creepily through the apartment as we still hear
the sound of the water running in the shower

stumbles to answer the door The shower water is still
running but Frida doesnt seem to notice

From inside the trunk the door opens and we see Peter and
Lloyd looking down into it They hold their noses from a bad
smell

LLOYD
You think mafia hit

PETER
Hard to tell Looks like hes been
cleaned up and hes decomposing as
we speak This case gets weirder
by the minute

LLOYD
It has to be Frida This makes
three guys ripped apart who are
tied to her ass

PETER
Okay Lloyd First no way does
Frida have the physical strength to
tear a guy to shreds Second why
would she be so obvious and let it
be known she was the last one to
see these guys Third shes the
findmoviescriptscom

one in danger Shes a woman in
jeopardy and youre layin a murder
rap on her Fourth I look in her

Paranoia insecurity depression

losing control belief that you
have a mental problem Nothing
about turning into a werewolf

JENNIFER
Check out what I found

Jennifer gets a very old-looking book out of her bag

JENNIFER
I found it in this out-of-the-way
used bookstore

Jennifer opens it up to a page she marked and reads aloud

JENNIFER
This is from a scientist in France
Madame Sconce The original
werewolves were females They
became werewolves on the lunar
cycle because it corresponded to
the womans cycle My suspicion is
findmoviescriptscom

that the only cure is true love

FRIDA
Great so all I have to do is fall
in love Like I havent tried that
for the past 24 years

JENNIFER
(continuing to read)
The female-cycle werewolf will
only kill men and never kills
someone she truly loves See I
knew you never loved Mark

FRIDA
Who is this Madame Sconce Lets
find her and talk to her

JENNIFER
She died at age 34 in the 1800s
They thought she was crazy She
was banished from her town Seems
her husband shot her

FRIDA
Guess she never found true love

JENNIFER
The weird thing is he shot her
with a silver bullet

FRIDA
So she was a werewolf Do you
think we can believe all this

JENNIFER
What choice do we have

FRIDA
So what do I do

JENNIFER
Fall in love

INT CHURCHCONFESSIONAL - DAY
Frida in one side of the confessional a PRIEST in the other

FRIDA
I was just wondering a person
has a choice between killing
themselves or killing others which
is worse I mean you fry in hell
either way right

PRIEST
If you kill yourself you wont be
around to ask for forgiveness or to
make a last confession whereas if
you kill others you can go to
confession do penance and be
absolved from your sins

FRIDA
But if the person is killing
several people then maybe its
better to kill oneself cause then
the killing stops

PRIEST
You have a point Hmmm Ive
findmoviescriptscom

never been asked this before
Who is being killed Catholics
Homosexuals Protestants
