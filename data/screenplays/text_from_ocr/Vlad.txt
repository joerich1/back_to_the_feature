Vlad

by
Charlie Hunnam

Sometimes the man is greater than the myth

May 26 2008
We pan over a map of fifteenth century EUROPE settling in the
east over the RIVER DANUBE North of the river lies
WALLACHIA MOLDAVIA TRANSILVANIA and HUNGARY To the South
the sprawling territories of the OTTOMAN EMPIRE

Over this runs script

Two hundred years after the Holy
Crusades began the Ottoman Empire
went on a fierce campaign to expand
its boarders and spread the
teachings of Islam

In response the kings of Eastern
Europe joined together to create a
royal fraternity sworn to protect
all Christians and oppose the
advance of the Infidel

This fraternity called themselves
the Order of the Dragon

As we fade to black a FLASH OF LIGHT erupts followed by
rumbling BOOM and CANNON FIRE explodes into the night

INT PRINCE’S BED CHAMBERS CASTLE - NIGHT

A young boy wakes with a jolt from a bad dream gasping for
breath He struggles to regain his composure looking over to
his YOUNGER BROTHER who sleeps soundly across the room

A CRUCIFIX above the boy’s bed draws his attention Then the
silence is broken as an imposing MAN enters the room

The man is dressed for battle two large PENDANTS hang around
his neck A CRUCIFIX and a GOLD DISK engraved with an
elaborate DRAGON INSIGNIA

This is DRACUL king of WALLACHIA The boy is his son VLAD

VLAD
Why are you dressed for battle

DRACUL
The Ottoman are here

This sends a shiver down Vlad’s spine

DRACUL (CONTD)
We are prepared for them Never
before has the Sultan encountered a
force the likes of the Dragon he
faces now And never again will he
Vlad holds his father’s gaze awed by his intensity

DRACUL (CONT’D)
Stay close to the castle while I am
gone and be good to your brother

VLAD
I will

Dracul kisses his son and turns to leave

VLAD (CONTD)
Be careful father

DRACUL
Kings do not fear death Vlad for
we are guaranteed a place in
heaven In return we must do all
that we can for our people and
country

Dracul regards his son for a moment longer before leaving
Vlad looks back to the crucifix silently crossing himself

EXT BANK OF THE DANUBE WALLACHIA - NIGHT

Dracul gallops through the night accompanied by the ROYAL
GUARD the air around them is filled by a DEAFENING THUNDER
As they crest a hill they get their first glimpse of the
RIVER DANUBE below and the source of the noise

SIXTY OTTOMAN WAR SHIPS are anchored a thousand feet from
WALLACHIA giving a frightening demonstration of their new
firepower Two hundred CANNONS bombard the shore

EXT CHRISTIAN CAMP BANK OF THE DANUBE WALLACHIA - NIGHT

Dracul makes his way through the Christian camp entering the
WAR TENT where he finds his brother-in-law and king of
neighboring MOLDAVIA BOGDAN He too wears a DRAGON PENDANT

BOGDAN
I knew we couldn’t trust those
slippery bastards

DRACUL
What are you talking about

BOGDAN
We’re the only ones here
DRACUL
We took an oath they’1ll be here

BOGDAN
Just in time to bury us

A wave of doubt washes over Dracul He shakes it off

DRACUL
They’1l be here

Through the cacophony of cannon fire cuts the piercing caw of
an EAGLE

EXT MOUNTAINS WALLACHIA - DAY

Vlad walks in the mountains with his brother RADU and cousin
STEPHEN aged seven and fourteen respectively The eagle
hovers above

VLAD
Moldavia is half our size
obviously that means your army is
half our size

STEPHEN
Maybe we just seem bigger because
we’re so much tougher

Vlad scoffs watching the eagle land in a tree close by

RADU
How big is the Ottoman army

STEPHEN
Massive Bigger than all the Dragon
armies combined

Vlad shoots Stephen a disapproving look

VLAD
But they are filthy unruly
heathens Radu and we have God on
our side We’ll destroy them

Vlad motions to the eagle ending the conversation Stephen
quickly lines up an easy shot but Vlad pushes down his bow

STEPHEN
What are you doing
VLAD
Any fool can shoot an eagle To
catch one alive takes real skill

STEPHEN
And you think you can

VLAD
(Picking up a stone)
Trick is to hit him in the chest
knock the wind out of him

Vlad throws the stone hitting the bird square in the chest
As the Eagle plummets to the ground Vlad sprints in its
direction leaping from a cliff and falling from sight

Radu and Stephen run to the cliff edge and nervously peer
over the side Vlad stands on a ledge fifteen feet below
holding the dazed eagle

STEPHEN
Show off

Vlad lets the bird go delighting in watching it soar away

VLAD
You two are going to have to jump
down here

STEPHEN
Are you mad I’m not jumping that

VLAD
I can’t get back up there

STEPHEN
Then youll have to walk back

alone serves you right for showing
off

Suddenly Radu barrels up and jumps Vlad catches him sending
them both tumbling to the ground laughing like hyenas

VLAD
You see It’s easy Radu can do it

Stephen is embarrassed but he cannot force himself to jump

STEPHEN
I’m going back to the castle

VLAD
Do you know the way Stephen
Stephen disappears without answering Vlad and Radu share a
guilty smile

VLAD (CONTD)
Nice jump

RADU
Thanks

EXT CHRISTIAN CAMP BANK OF THE DANUBE WALLACHIA - DAY

The Ottoman boats have moved forward their cannons now
bombard the camp Christian soldiers line the bank of the
Danube trying to prevent them from mooring Heavy casualties
are being sustained

Dracul oversees the effort as a party of horsemen approach
led by HUNYADI KING OF TRANSILVANIA

DRACUL
Hunyadi what news from the North

Hunyadi dismounts his mood solemn He too wears a dragon
pendant

HUNYADI
Grave news brothers Sigismund is
dead Hungary will not fight
Poland has withdrawn too

The grim reality of this ripples through the crowd

DRACUL
How many men have you brought

HUNYADI
None Without the might of our
Northern neighbors we stand no
chance against the Ottoman

BOGDAN
You worthless coward bastard You
assembled this coalition

HUNYADI
Which is why I am here but defeat
is inevitable We must surrender
today so we may be strong enough to
strike tomorrow

DRACUL
This is my country
Dracul grabs Hunyadi ready to throttle him Bogdan separates
them

DRACUL (CONTD)
Damn you to hell Hunyadi Leave
now if you did not come to fight
You are no longer welcome here

HUNYADI
You will always be welcome with me
if you need a place to retreat

Hunyadi departs leaving the two kings fuming Dracul stares
out at the colossal army they face resigned to what must be
done He calls over his General and chief advisor CAZAN

DRACUL
Cazan Raise the white flag

BOGDAN
Youre surrendering

DRACUL
What choice do I have We are
beaten I will not slaughter these
men to prove it

Cazan nods his approval and moves off leaving Dracul to mull
the enormity of this decision

DRACUL (CONTD)
Stay here until after I have
negotiated with the Sultan If I am
killed or taken prisoner Francesca
and the boys should go back to
Moldavia with you

Suddenly the cannon fire stops followed by a roar of
celebration from the Ottoman The white flag has been raised

VOICE OS
You cannot defeat me

EXT TOWN COMMON TIRGOVISTE WALLACHIA - DAY

Vlad taunts his two SPARRING PARTNERS in a makeshift training
ring Radu and Stephen watch as he gives an impressive
display of thrusts and parries A magnificent GOTHIC CASTLE
looms over the small township

Suddenly all attention is drawn to a party of horsemen who
thunder past riding towards the castle Bogdan leads them
STEPHEN
It’s my father

Instantly the boys are sprinting in the horseman’s wake

INT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE - DAY

Vlad bursts in to find his mother FRANCESCA wailing into
Bogdan’s chest Cazan stands nearby

VLAD
What happened Has father been
killed

Francesca crosses to Vlad embracing him tightly

FRANCESCA
Your father is fine

VLAD
Where is he

BOGDAN
Waiting for you

FRANCESCA
He’s not taking them

Stephen and Radu rush in startled by Francesca’s outburst

VLAD
What happened Cazan

CAZAN
We were forced to surrender a
treaty was negotiated As security
the Sultan wishes to take you and
Radu back to Adrianople with him

VLAD
We are to be Ottoman prisoners

FRANCESCA
No

Radu is bewildered as Francesca smothers him in her embrace
but Vlad knows that her protests cannot prevent this

VLAD
When do we leave
EXT WALLACHIAN SHIP DANUBE - DAY

Vlad stands on the bow of the ship watching Bulgaria
approach the Ottoman navy moored to its bank He takes
several deep breaths steadying his nerves

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP BANK OF THE DANUBE BULGARIA - DAY

Dracul watches the ship’s approach from the edge of the
Ottoman camp SULTAN MURAD appears at his shoulder an older
man with clever eyes and an easy air of power

MURAD
Have your time with them then
bring them to me

DRACUL
You talk much of your honor I am
trusting my children’s lives on it

MURAD
As long as our friendship lives so
shall they

Dracul mounts his horse riding down to the Danube

EXT BANK OF THE DANUBE BULGARIA - DAY

Dracul embraces his sons at the bank of the river Vlad is
acutely aware of the Ottoman soldiers milling around

DRACUL
I am sorry to have to ask for your
help so soon

VLAD
How long are we to be prisoners

DRACUL
Watch your tone with me

Dracul leaves Radu with Cazan as he talks to Vlad privately

DRACUL (CONTD)

Life is hard Vlad how you deal
with adversity determines what kind
of man you are As kings we must be
great men This is your first duty
as prince of Wallachia I want you
to put it to good use
VLAD
How can I be of any use here

DRACUL
(Covertly)
To know your enemy is the greatest
weapon a king can have

Vlad visibly inflates suddenly feeling empowered Though the
words are hollow in Dracul’s mouth and now haste advances
with the Sultan’s approach

DRACUL (CONT’D)
I will not rest until you are home
you have my word Until then keep
close watch on Radu He is young
and does not yet understand the
world

VLAD
I will look after him

Dracul takes off his CRUCIFIX and fastens it around Vlad’s
neck embracing him tightly

DRACUL
Remember who you are Vlad there
will be pressure to forget

Vlad nods holding back tears as they rejoin Radu and Cazan
When the Sultan arrives everyone in the vicinity bows
Including Dracul

Vlad is devastated to see his father so emasculated When
Dracul raises his head Vlad cannot meet his eye
INT SULTAN’S CARRIAGE BULGARIA - DAY

Vlad stares out of the window Radu asleep on his shoulder
Murad lowers the document he reads to study them

INT DRAWING ROOM PALACE ADRIANOPLE - NIGHT

Murad strides into a large drawing room where his WIFE and
TWO CHILDREN stand waiting

MURAD
Welcome our two latest wards
Princes Vlad and Radu of Wallachia
This is my wife Mara and my
children Mohammed and Sofia

Mohammed has the deposition of a child who knows he is on the
side with all of the power He regards the prince’s rustic
clothing with amusement

MOHAMMED
Welcome to Adrianople I am sure it
is very different from what you are
used to

VLAD
Very different

Vlad’s animosity is palpable equally disdainful of
Mohammeds fine silk wear Murad diffuses

MURAD
You can learn much from one
another Get some rest tonight
tomorrow you begin your studies

Murad signals to a GUARD

MURAD (CONT’D)
Show them to their quarters

The Guard BOWS and strides away the Princes turn to follow
MURAD (CONTD)
In our culture it is customary to
bow to your Sultan when you enter
and leave his presence

Radu bows but Vlad does not

VLAD
In our culture a king bows only to
God

They run after the guard leaving Mohammed furious by the
insubordination Murad smiles he quite enjoyed the moxie

MURAD
He will come around

INT PRINCE’S CHAMBERS PALACE ADRIANOPLE - NIGHT

The door locks behind the Princes and they quietly take in
their new surroundings A simple room with a small window and
two beds

VLAD
You can choose cots

RADU
Can I sleep with you

VLAD
Just for tonight

Radu climbs onto one of the cots Vlad sits down by his side

VLAD (CONTD)
Don’t bow to the Sultan again We
are political prisoners not his
subjects

RADU
Father did

VLAD
Just do as I say Radu

Radu nods closing his eyes but Vlad will not sleep tonight

INT CLASSROOM PALACE ADRIANOPLE - DAY

A worn Bulgarian knight stands at the front of the class
this is LEVENT The wall behind him is covered by
ILLUSTRATIONS OF FORTIFICATIONS Vlad and Radu sit together
on one side of the room Mohammed and his friends on the
other

Levent points to a fortification next to a river
LEVENT
Semna in Egypt army estimated at
twenty thousand Who wants to
start

Mohammed nods this is clearly his favorite subject

MOHAMMED
I would use my cannons to collapse
the front and rear walls and then
rush them from both sides With the
bigger army I would crush them in
a day

LEVENT
Aggressive but is it efficient

MOHAMMED
Conquering a fortress in one day is
fairly efficient

Mohammed’s entourage laugh

VLAD
If you don’t care about the lives
of your soldiers

Levent smiles a lifelong soldier

LEVENT
Elaborate

VLAD
In siege those inside the building
always have the advantage When
fighting twenty you could lose
thirty

LEVENT
What would you do

VLAD
It’s the desert so they cannot dig
wells that’s why the fortress is
so close to the river I would cut
off their water supply draw them
out into the open and take away
their advantage

MOHAMMED
That would take months

VLAD
It takes years to raise soldiers
Plus this way you don’t destroy the
building you are trying to acquire

The class laugh Mohammed does not

LEVENT
Good work Vlad

Murad clears his throat announcing his presence All stand
and bow except Vlad and Radu The Sultan regards them evenly
noting Radu’s increased insubordination

MURAD
You have a good mind for strategy
Vlad now we must work on your
Manners Carry on Levent

Murad departs leaving Mohammed reeling in the humiliation of
being bested by Vlad in front of his father

EXT PALACE GARDENS ADRIANOPLE - DAY

The class is on recess Vlad has fallen asleep under the
shade of a tree Radu sits by his side watching the other
boys play with a wooden ball One of them notices and waves
him over

OLDER BOY
You come from Wallachia What do
you do for fun up there

RADU
Ride horses hunt eagles

The boys laugh at the provincial Prince’s idea of fun

OLDER BOY
Medeniyete hosgeldiniz Do you
speak any Turkish
(Radu shakes his head)
That means welcome to civilization

More laughter Vlad wakes looking over to the boys

OLDER BOY (CONT’D)
(Noticing Radu’s crucifix)
I see you know Jesus do you know
Mohammed

Radu nods pointing to Mohammed Raucous laughter Vlad is
getting annoyed and moves into earshot

OLDER BOY (CONTD)
I meant the prophet Mohammed

Mohammed notices Vlad now listening and stands assuming the
role of tutor

MOHAMMED

There were twenty-five prophets
Radu Adam Noah Moses Solomon
Jesus You have heard of these men

(Radu nods)
The final prophet was a man called
Mohammed He spoke directly to
Allah to God Then he wrote a book
called the Koran about the things
Allah told him

Vlad storms over to Radu pulling him away from the group

VLAD
Enough of your rubbish you don’t
talk to my brother

MOHAMMED
You are an Ottoman subject now
Vlad you must learn our ways

Vlad continues to walk away Mohammed determined to bait him

MOHAMMED (CONTD)
You will soon realize you are not
my equal My father is a legend
yours is an ordinary coward

In a heart beat Vlad is upon him lashing out with a torrent
of blows The fight is going one way fast then Mohammed
pulls out a pocket knife and things even up

VLAD
You talk of cowardice then pull a
knife on an unarmed man

Mohammed is clearly scared and lashes out missing On the
second swing he slices Vlad’s shoulder Vlad replies with a
thunderous knee to Mohammed’s thigh sending him to the
ground The knife clatters away Vlad scooping it up

VLAD (CONTD)
You know what we did in Wallachia
Learnt how to fight

RADU
Don’t Vlad

Too late SLASH Vlad brings the knife down across Mohammeds
face sending the young Sultan to his knees Everyone is
shocked silent Vlad drops the knife as guards rush in

EXT TRAINING YARD PALACE ADRIANOPLE - DAY

Vlad tries to contain his trembling as he awaits punishment
A crowd has gathered to watch the spectacle Murad steps
forward slapping Vlad to his knees

MURAD
Obviously I have been too lenient
with you but you will learn You
are nothing unless I grant it not
a prince not a king First you
must be my subject Bow to me

Vlad gets to his feet but instead of bowing he stands tall
Murad slaps him back to his knees

MURAD (CONT’D)
Stand up and bow to me

Again Vlad stands and again he does not bow

VLAD
I bow only to God

MURAD
And now to your Sultan as do all
of my other subjects

VLAD
I am not your subject

Murad strikes Vlad twice more sending him back to the
ground His nose and mouth are bloody

MURAD
Fortunately for the future of your
country your brother appears to be
more malleable
Vlad leaps forward straining against his binds

VLAD
Stay away from my brother

Murad smiles nodding to his general

MURAD
Give him ten lashes

A NEANDERTHAL GUARD eagerly steps forward but Levent
intercepts him taking the whip Vlad locks eyes with the
Sultan Then they come ONE TWO THREE

Vlad cries out at each strike but quickly regains his
composure returning his gaze to the Sultan

MURAD (CONT’D)
You will learn

INT PRINCES CELL PALACE ADRIANOPLE - DAY

Levent accompanies Vlad back to his cell his bloodied back
covered by wet silk As they approach Radu is led out of
their cell by a NURSE and TWO GUARDS

VLAD
Where are you taking him

LEVENT
The Sultan has ordered for you to
be separated

Vlad tries to approach his brother Levent restrains him

LEVENT (CONT’D)
You are allowed no further contact
until the Sultan declares it

Radu is upset seeing his brother’s condition

RADU
What happened to your back

VLAD
Radu listen to me you must
remember who you are You are a
Christian and prince of Wallachia
ignore their blasphemy and lies

The guards hustle Radu away Vlad calling after him

VLAD (CONTD)
We are not Ottoman subjects Radu
remember that Father will have us
home before winter

Levent pushes Vlad into his cell
LEVENT

If you keep this up you will be
dead before winter
VLAD
Go to hell

LEVENT
I am trying to help you Vlad

VLAD
By lashing me

LEVENT
Better I than he who wanted to I
understand your anger but you are
here now Your only focus should be
getting out alive

Vlad nods and Levent takes his leave Alone in his cell Vlad
peels the silk from his back revealing deep lacerations Then
he hangs his Crucifix from the wall and dropping to his knees

before Christ Almighty Vlad bows his head in prayer

VLAD
Oh Mighty God give me the strength
to live on in the glory of Thy
name Let there be known amongst
our enemies vengeance for the blood
of Thy servants which has been
shed And guide my passage home
through this valley of darkness so
that I may reunite with my family
and fulfill my duty to Thee Amen

As we circle back around Vlad we see that it is TEN YEARS

LATER He is now a YOUNG MAN intense in his prayer

The

muscles on his back ripple under a patchwork of scars

EXT COMBAT TRAINING FACILITY PALACE ADRIANOPLE - DAY

house

Levent grins and they cross to their canteens to drink

VLAD (CONTD)
What new whispers from Europe

LEVENT
I meant what I said I am not
telling you any more news

Vlad drinks never taking his eyes off Levent

VLAD
You know something good don’t you
Come on Levent don’t be an arse I
have nothing without you

LEVENT
Then you should learn to tow the
line

Levent holds out for a moment longer before relenting

LEVENT (CONTD)
King Ladislas of Poland joined the
Dragon Order

VLAD
How old is he

LEVENT
Eighteen

VLAD
Little bastard He won’t change
anything none of them ever do

Vlad’s familiar anxiety is beginning to swell He looks over
the HALF DOZEN GUARDS now a constant presence around him

VLAD (CONTD)
I have to get out of here

LEVENT
This is why I should not tell you
these things You will get out of
here when the Sultan releases you

VLAD
When will that be

LEVENT
When the Sultan releases you

Vlad looks back over to the guards the high walls
LEVENT (CONTD)

You know Vlad you would do well to
copy your brother Radu’s example

As intended this gets a rise out of Vlad

VLAD
I’m going to kill you old man

And they are fighting again

INT PALACE ARENA ADRIANOPLE - DAY

A final strike and Radu scores a point as the finishing bell
rings The crowd erupt with applause none more excitedly
than Sofia Mohammed rides to Radu joining the celebration

MOHAMMED
Always the showman

RADU
Just giving the crowd what they

RADU
I’ll drink it all Is your sister

watching him He gives her a little wave

MOHAMMED (CONTD)
Youre pathetic

The boys continue on their way laughing as they go

INT VLAD’S CELL PALACE ADRIANOPLE - DAY

It is early morning but Vlad is already doing vigorous
pushups on the floor of his cell Then the faint notes of a
woman’s laughter break his rhythm

Vlad crosses to the window looking down to the gardens below
where he sees RADU EMBRACED WITH SOFIA They kiss before
quickly departing in separate directions

Vlad dons a shirt and retrieves a gold coin from beneath his
mattress before knocking hard on his cell door

VLAD

VLAD

Now

INT RADU’S CHAMBER PALACE ADRIANOPLE - DAY

terrific spirits

RADU
Good morning brother

VLAD
Did you sleep well last night

Radu smiles realizing he’s caught

RADU
How did you know

VLAD
I saw you in the garden this
morning the whole palace probably
saw you Have you lost your mind

RADU
It’s just harmless fun

VLAD
You have to be smarter than this
What if the Sultan catches you
There will be hell to pay

RADU
Okay you’ve made your point Vlad
You should go back to your room
before you get into trouble

But Vlad cannot drop it

VLAD
She is an Ottoman Princess you
cannot court her God knows how
many rules you are breaking

RADU
Since when have you been a paragon
of good behavior

VLAD
I’m serious Radu You cannot court
her

Radu sees the concern on his brother’s face placates

RADU
Okay I will put an end to it

Then Mohammed barrels in no love lost between he and Vlad

MOHAMMED
Something big is happening my
father called an emergency meeting
with his generals

several guards approach The mood is suddenly very tense

Radu flushes under the wry stare of Murad

RADU
I thank you for the offer Sultan
but I cannot do anything until Vlad
returns

his son Murad’s friendly disposition evaporates

MURAD
Vlad will try to take power

Moldavia warn him that any
assistance he gives Vlad will be
seen as a breach of our treaty

MOHAMMED

happily deal with it for you I
will teach the arrogant shit a

barley escaped

VLAD
Treacherous slag Europe is facing
the greatest threat it has ever
seen and we spend the whole time
killing our own

Vlad gazes at his dragon pendant scrutinizing the insignia

VLAD (CONTD)
This is why the Dragon Order was
originally founded Look at the
insignia the all powerful dragon
is being choked by its own tail

The fire reflects off of the chocking dragon

VLAD (CONTD)
We are the Dragon Wallachia
Moldavia the people The tail is
her politics scheming noblemen and
Ottoman invaders If we cut off the
tail we free the dragon

STEPHEN
And how are we going to do that
Look at us we’re sitting ina

them what we have learnt

inherited some of father’s fondness
for you

RADU
I wish I could do more It tortures
me to see her in such pain

Sultan fills his mind

MOHAMMED
I have called for all of the forces
from across my empire to assemble
outside of Constantinople To honor
my father we will conquer the
great city for the first time in
history

Radu is shocked to find himself included in these plans

RADU
I want no part in that

MOHAMMED
This is inevitable Radu
Constantinople stands on a small
piece of land surrounded for
hundreds of miles by my empire
They know they are beaten

RADU
Then what do you want from me

MOHAMMED
I would prefer to take the city
intact without unnecessary
bloodshed Constantine will not
negotiate with me you he would
give audience

RADU
And if they do not surrender

Radu This is our destiny first we
take Constantinople then we move
for Europe You will be king of
Wallachia with my sister as your
queen

black hair bright green eyes olive skin

WOMAN

VLAD

The horse wakes noisily getting to its feet The woman
gently soothes him effortlessly throwing a saddle onto his
back Vlad watches her enamored by her brass and beauty

will fetch a few coins in the
market

Vlad nods respecting her code

VLAD
Were you born into that life

ELEANOR
No I used to live on an estate

One man steps forward He is rugged with piercing black eyes
and a scar from ear to ear This is CALIN KING OF THE
GYPSIES

CALIN

you address me son I am Calin
king of the realm not controlled by
the castle I own these hills If
you steal I get a piece

VLAD
Lend me your support Help me
retrieve my throne and I will make
you rich beyond your wildest
dreams

CALIN
That’s a lot of gold
(His men laugh)

CALIN (CONTD)
If we want gold we can rob the
treasury Why should we help you

VLAD
Because your countrymen starve
while this illegitimate bastard
king and his corrupt noblemen get
rich It is time to give Wallachia
back to the people

GYPSY MAN
It was your father caused all this
trouble in the first place when he
agreed to the Ottoman treaty

VLAD
It cost him his life and I spent
ten years in prison As God is my
witness that will not happen again

CALIN
What will you do when the Ottoman
return

VLAD

We will stand strong and fight the
whole country united But for that
we must give the people something
worth fighting for

Eleanor calls over the crowd

ELEANOR
And how will you do that

VLAD
I will cut taxes to the noblemen
give each man equal right to this
land

CALIN
The noblemen will go to war

VLAD
With what men Those that we just
freed from their slavery

Calin regards Vlad intrigued
CALIN
Alright Vlad you’ve won my ear

Join me for a drink

the castle
(Off of Vlad’s surprise)
I told you I was going to rob the
treasury

His men laugh

VLAD
Gypsy bastards

More laughter Calin regards Vlad evenly

CALIN
If we make you king and you turn
out to be like all the rest of
them your reign will be short and
your death will be brutal You
understand

VLAD
I swear I want only what is best
for Wallachia

Now it is Vlad who challenges Calin

VLAD (CONTD)
But if we do this there is no
turning back It will be a rough
road I need to know you will be
there with me to ride it out

CALIN
I didn’t get this pretty being
afraid of a fight and if I give you
my word it’s final

decision is made between them

You wanted soldiers

VLAD
That idea came later I followed
you because I wanted to see you
again You left so abruptly last

night

ELEANOR
I am not usually that fond of
noblemen

VLAD

We have that in common
Vlad smiles but Eleanor has not come to banter

ELEANOR
I told you we were evicted from our
estate Well we had nowhere to go
so we resisted I watched both of
my parents die

Vlad feels the weight of responsibility

ELEANOR (CONTD)
I am responsible for bringing you
here Don’t let us down do the
things you say you will do

VLAD
I guarantee it I lost my family
through these troubles too
Eleanor

ELEANOR
I know that but you will have your
revenge and get back your throne
It will be easy to forget about the
promises you made to us

VLAD
I will not forget anything least
of all you

Eleanor blushes at the declaration

VLAD (CONTD)
And if it be your will I will
personally bring to justice the men
that killed your family

ELEANOR
Calin killed them years ago Calin
is my brother

Vlad is further struck by the serendipity of their meeting

It was no coincidence that we met
Once I have proven myself I hope
you will give me the chance to know
you better

yourself I wish you luck with the

Welcome to Constantinople Radu I

RADU
I wish I had known him better It
is with a heavy heart that I come
here today

CONSTANTINE
Please join us This is our
Archbishop Edmund

Edmund nods a cold welcome as Radu sits Silence

CONSTANTINE (CONTD)
Well we all know why we are here
What is his offer

RADU
Constantinople will become part of
the Ottoman Empire the Sultan
himself assuming the title of
Caesar Christian prayer will be
permitted but Islam will become the
first religion of the city All
gold and assets will be seized

Edmund whispers angrily into Constantine’s ear

RADU (CONTD)
I know it is difficult but I urge
you to accept the alternative is
much worse The Sultan is
determined to take Constantinople
and he has the force to do it Save
yourselves surrender the city

EDMUND
(Enraged)
You come here and presume you can
dictate what is best for God’s
city You do the devil’s bidding

these hallow grounds

CONSTANTINE (CONTD)
It breaks my heart to think that
all we have done could be reduced
to a whisper It is worth fighting
for no matter how inevitable the
outcome

Radu is racked with guilt Constantine magnanimous

just misguided Tell your Sultan my

into the castle Vlad and Calin see him go

You stay here

The Guard is momentarily frozen by the sight of Vlad dropping
from the castle roof onto the chamber balcony The Guard goes
for his weapon but Vlad is quicker throwing a short sword
which slams into the Guard’s chest killing him instantly

Wladislav runs for the door but Vlad beats him to it
slamming the smaller man into the solid oak He drops to the
floor where Vlad pins him with a foot to the throat

VLAD
(To Wladislav’s wife)
You might not want to watch this

In seconds she is out of the door Vlad bolts it behind her
as Wladislav clamors to his feet

VLAD (CONTD)
I’ve been looking forward to this

Vlad backhands Wladislav sending him to the ground again

WLADISLAV
It is a coward’s work to kill an
unarmed man

Vlad tosses his sword onto the bed Again Wladislav scrambles
to his feet

VLAD
You buried my father alive Did you
nail the coffin shut yourself All
that power you must have felt ten
feet tall

Wladislav fakes a lunge and barges past Vlad attempting to
reach the sword Vlad tackles him to the ground and begins to
mercilessly beat him hitting him over and over and over

Eventually Wladislav goes limp Vlad straddles him pulling
back his head to exposing his throat Wladislav’s breath
quickens as Vlad leans over him but Vlad only whispers in his
ear

VLAD (CONTD)
I’m going to hang you at dawn

VLAD
Welcome to my court

The noblemen exchange looks back and forth but all remain
silent until the bravest of them stands This is GALES

GALES
I for one think this is a total
outrage You cannot abolish taxes

VLAD
I just did

Another of the noblemen now stands

NOBLEMAN
As king you are the chosen voice of
many Together we govern Wallachia
not you alone Tell him Cazan

The noblemen rap on the table calling out their agreement

VLAD
But you do not govern You bicker
and scheme about how best to enrich
yourselves while the country rots
and the people starve

father ruined us

This sucks the air out of the room Vlad regards Gales with

deadly calm

VLAD

GALES
Gales of Severin your highness

VLAD
Severin You have a large estate
no wonder youre upset Speak ill
of my father again and I will cut
you down where you stand

Vlad turns back to the council

VLAD (CONTD)

For months no tribute has been paid
to the Ottoman and yet you did not
lower taxes instead you profited
from your people’s suffering Think
of this as God’s punishment

Vlad stands calling the meeting to a close

VLAD (CONTD)

Any man found still implementing
taxes will be imprisoned one year
for every ducat taken Go now and
spread the good news to your
people

The noblemen quickly exit only Gales lingers

GALES
I never agreed with your father’s
policies but I supported him Don’t
expect the same courtesy

VLAD

The deeds to three hundred acres
It was Wladislav’s Manor I don’t
think he needs it now

Calin smiles genuinely moved

If only I could see Mohammed’s face
when he hears the news To

They drink the toast enjoying the victory and alcohol Vlad
turns to Calin with a sly grin

VLAD (CONTD)

MOHAMMED

Not at all I’ve been eager to see

you

MOHAMMED (CONTD)
You left Constantinople so quickly

RADU
I had to get away from there I
felt sick to have been a part of
it

MOHAMMED
And how do you feel now

RADU
The same I am equal parts of two
things that are determined to
destroy each other I am too
involved in both to fight for
either

MOHAMMED
So you must fight for both

RADU
Clearly that is not possible

MOHAMMED

Accepting ones destiny is never
easy Most men don’t and are
forgotten the moment they die That
is not who we are

RADU
Do not talk to me in riddles
Mohammed

MOHAMMED

You wish to walk away because it
pains you to fight yet you are in
a unique position to facilitate
peace As you know Vlad has taken
the throne He is refusing to honor
our treaty You can negotiate with
him convince him to cooperate

RADU
You know as well as I do Vlad’s
feeling towards Ottoman rule he
will never agree to your treaty
Which leaves what Declare war
This is exactly what just happened
in Constantinople

MOHAMMED
We were born to bear arms and
conquer whatever is before us

RADU
I was not

Radu is unmovable in his resolve Finally Mohammed relents
with a sigh

MOHAMMED
So what will you do

RADU
Live a simple life not prince nor
politician just a husband and
father But I would still ask for
Sofia’s hand

MOHAMMED

I had hoped you would be such an
asset in Europe

(Nodding his consent)
You will have to convert to Islam
Sofia is still an Ottoman Princes
your children must be born of pure
blood

Radu nods he knew this would be the compromise Mohammed
offers his hand and they shake

swim in this lake as a child

VLAD

I believe you are a good man Vlad
but we have to be realistic It
could never work between you and I
You are king now I am still a

gypsy girl

ever wanted to go Remember that

An eagle dives down into the middle of the lake fishing

slams into Vlad’s shoulder Vlad spins to see movement in the
trees and calls out to his guards

VLAD
Assassin

He snaps off Eleanor’s arrow and pushes her into the lake

VLAD (CONT’D)
Get under the water swim out to
the middle

Another arrow splashes into the lake Vlad pushes Eleanor
under the water before sprinting towards the treeline in
sharp zigzags His guards are too far away to be of any use

One more arrow hits the ground at Vlad’s feet but as he gets
closer to the treeline the ASSASSIN spooks and abandons the
mission The chase is on Vlad gaining

But then the arrow in his back begins to take toll Mustering
the last of his strength Vlad launches his sword like a
spear It slams between the assassin’s shoulders The
assassin falls face forward In seconds Vlad is on him

VLAD (CONTD)
Who sent you You can die in peace
or in terrible pain It makes no
difference now if you tell me Who
sent you

Vlad takes out his dagger and pushes his fingers into the
assassin’s mouth pulling out his tongue

VLAD (CONTD)
I’m going to cut out your tongue
and leave you here to die unless
you tell me who sent you

The assassin begins to cry but still he does not talk Vlad
puts his knife to the tongue

VLAD (CONTD)
Don’t make me do this just tell me
who sent you

ASSASSIN
Vlad Vlad the Monk Kill me
please just kill me

VLAD
Where are you from

ASSASSIN
Severin

INT CASTLE CORRIDOR TIRGOVISTE - DAY

Vlad leads Cazan into a small room shutting the door for
privacy

VLAD
The assassin said he was sent by a
man called Vlad the Monk Does that
name mean anything to you

It is clear from Cazan’s reaction that it does

CAZAN
He is your brother

Vlad is shocked silent

CAZAN (CONTD)
The result of an affair before you
were born It meant nothing and for
years the mother’s claim went
ignored But after losing you and
against my advice your father
sought the child out They only met
once but it was enough for her to
confirm his legitimacy

VLAD
So this bastard thinks he has claim
to my throne

CAZAN
He is from the royal male bone
This is why you must be careful
with the noblemen

VLAD
What do you mean

CAZAN
You have made many powerful enemies
Vlad I doubt The Monk could do
this without support

VLAD
So the noblemen champion his claim
The assassin said he was from
Severin
(Fury building)
Gales

CAZAN
You cannot be rash Vlad you must
be certain before you act

VLAD
And end up buried alive like my
father This requires a decisive
response

Vlad storms from the room leaving Cazan deeply concerned

INT WAR ROOM CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - DAY

TWO OTTOMAN ENVOYS wait impatiently whilst the noblemen
gossip rabidly A hush falls as Vlad strides in and sits
heavily into his throne The Envoys step forward

ENVOY ONE
We were shocked to hear of your
trouble this morning thanks be to
Allah your injuries were not more

severe
VLAD

Indeed What do you want
ENVOY ONE

Sultan Mohammed sends his best

regards
(MORE )

ENVOY ONE (CONTD)
He compliments you on your success
and commends your ability as king
Now he must insist that you resume
your alliance in full

VLAD
We have no alliance

The second envoy immediately produces a scroll

ENVOY TWO
This is a signed treaty made
between your fathers turning
Wallachia over to control of the
Ottoman Empire

VLAD
May I

Vlad briefly looks at the document before setting it alight

VLAD (CONTD)
I just took control back

The Envoys are furious

ENVOY ONE
Foolishness that changes nothing
Wallachia belongs to the Ottoman
Empire You owe twenty thousand
ducats tribute which you will pay
immediately or feel our wrath And
our assassins do not miss

Vlad whirls on the envoy cutting him down in his tracks The
second envoy is routed to the spot prostrate with fear

VLAD
You do not make threats in my
court Wallachia is a free country
controlled by no one but her king
If the Sultan would like to visit
in person and discuss our future as
equals I will meet him But never
again send messengers to make
threats Be gone

The Envoy hurries out leaving his colleague dead on the
ground Vlad turns to the council

VLAD (CONTD)
That takes care of that Now who
here knows a man called Vlad the
Monk

Vlad tosses the Assassin’s pouch of gold onto the table in
front of Gales Gales tries to swallow the boulder in his
throat

VLAD (CONTD)

Gales does as he is told Vlad touches the tip of his bloody
sword to his throat

VLAD (CONTD)
Where is he

GALES
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

Vlad throws the gold coins in Gales face

VLAD
Are these not your coins The
assassin told me you sent him Tell
me where to find the Monk and I
will spare your life

GALES
I have never met him I hear he
stays in the Hungarian border
towns

VLAD
Is that what you hear Good

Vlad nods lowering the sword Only to bring it swiftly back
up slicing Gales from ear to ear Gales falls to the ground

VLAD (CONTD)

(To a Gypsy guard)
Tell Calin to go to Hungary find
this bastard Vlad the Monk

CAZAN
Vlad in light of what has just
happened we may have serious
problems with the Ottoman It may
not be wise to instigate trouble in
Hungary where we currently have
peace

VLAD
I see no peace in this son of a
whore and his supporters plotting
to take my throne

(MORE)

VLAD (CONTD)
To have any chance against the
Ottoman we must have unity in
Wallachia

Vlad walks to the door leaving the council stunned

VLAD (CONTD)
(Re Gales)
And put that slag on a spike teach
people what happens to traitors

INT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT

Vlad lies in bed wide awake his mind reeling Eleanor sleeps
soundly next to him Unable to contain his anxiety Vlad
rises and goes to the balcony to pace On the common below
torches illuminate the IMPALED body of Gales

Suddenly spooked by a noise from the darkness Vlad
extinguishes the balcony lanterns plunging the space into
darkness Awoken by the commotion Eleanor watches him for a
moment before rising to join him

ELEANOR
You cannot sleep again

Vlad shakes his head peering out into the darkness

VLAD
Tell the maid not to light these
lanterns again

Eleanor nods looking over to the body of Gales A shiver
runs down her spine

ELEANOR
Maybe you should take down the
body Let this whole thing rest

VLAD
He stays until the crows have
stripped his flesh

ELEANOR
Viad

Vlad continues to stare off into the night

VLAD
It cannot rest He is still out
there somewhere waiting Until he
is found neither of us are safe

ELEANOR
Calin will find him Nobody would
dare try anything now anyhow

Vlad smiles though her words offer little comfort

VLAD
I don’t know what I would do if I
lost you

ELEANOR

I’m not going anywhere We just
need to stay close to the castle
until he’s found

Something about this strikes an ugly chord with Vlad

VLAD
How long will that be I cannot let
this bastard make us prisoners in
our own home

A new resolve begins to slowly take hold of Vlad He
hurriedly reenters their chambers and begins dressing

ELEANOR
Where are you going

VLAD
If he will not to come to me I
will go to him

ELEANOR
It is the middle of the night
Vlad This is how you will get
killed

Vlad kisses her his resolve now outweighing his melancholy
VLAD
I have to do this Things will be
better when I return
He kisses her again but when he leaves it is without her
blessing

He scales the steps and enters the front door which has been
left wide open

INT HALLWAYS CALIN’S MANOR HOUSE - DAWN

Many people seem to be occupying this house Vlad finally
locates Calin in an upstairs bedroom unconscious with a girl
and a bottle of Palinca Vlad kicks him awake not amused

VLAD
Have you located the Monk

CALIN
My men are looking it might take
some time

VLAD
I don’t have any time He may have
already sent more assassins to put
an arrow through my heart Get
ready we are leaving in an hour

Calin looks down at his beautiful naked lady sighing heavily
before dragging himself to his feet

EXT SMALL VILLAGE HUNGARY - DAY

HUNGARIAN VILLAGERS watch in horror as Vlad’s men escort
petrified Monks out of the monastery Calin exits shaking his
head A TALL BROTHER musters his courage turning to Vlad

TALL BROTHER
Whoever you are looking for he is
clearly not here Leave now

Vlad slaps the Brother to his knees making the crowd gasp

TALL BROTHER (CONT’D)
Through pain I feel Gods
salvation

Vlad grabs the Brother by the hair pulling him close

VLAD
You will be begging for God’s mercy
by the time I am finished Where is
Vlad

The Brother will still not talk Vlad is about the strike him
again when a YOUNG BOY rushes forward

BOY
A Monk hides in the chapel of
Yagis two miles yonder

VLAD
Thank you
(To the Brother)
Saved by a child

EXT CHAPEL VILLAGE OF YAGIS HUNGARY - DAY

Calin and his men surround the SMALL CHAPEL A handful of
curious villagers have gathered in the distance Suddenly the
chapel door bursts open and Vlad the Monk falls out Vlad
brings up the rear pulling him to his feet

VLAD
Walk

THE MONK
I swear I know nothing about these
crimes you speak of

VLAD
Then why were you hiding

The Monk has no reply Vlad pushes him to start walking
again moving towards the back of the chapel

VLAD (CONT’D)
I just don’t understand why you
went to them instead of coming to
me I am your brother I would have
given you land and titles Instead
you sent an assassin who shot my
wife

Vlad leaps forward knocking The Monk back to the ground

THE MONK
I just listened to what they had to
say I know nothing of an assassin

VLAD
He gave me your name

The Monk scrambles back to his feet Realizing this is all
over his head he starts to cry

THE MONK
A man called Gales visited me all
I did was listen He said you were
ruining Wallachia and it was my
duty from God to stop it I swear
all I did was listen

VLAD
Then why were you hiding Did you
agree to take my throne

The Monk holds his crucifix tears streaming down his face

VLAD (CONTD)
Did you agree to take my throne

THE MONK
Yes But I knew nothing of an
assassin I swear

VLAD
How else did you think you would
get it Get down on your knees

The Monk is suddenly struck with a ray of hope

THE MONK
I am still a Monk of the Orthodox
Church As knight of the Dragon you
are sworn to harm no Christians

His words resonate in Vlad but still he pushes him to his
knees Again The Monk cracks pleading

THE MONK (CONT’D)
Please I will disappear into the
monastery You will never hear from
me again I swear

VLAD
I cannot take that risk

Realizing his time has truly come The Monk begins to Pray
raising his crucifix to Vlad as a last form of defense

VLAD (CONTD)
Forgive me

And Vlad slams down his sword The Monk’s mother arrives at
the chapel just in time to see her son fall

MOTHER
No Murderer

A Gypsy contains her as Calin crosses to Vlad unable to
disguise his contempt for this act

VLAD
I know but it was necessary Make
sure he receives a proper burial

Vlad mounts his horse and without looking at the Monk’s
mother he gallops away

EXT TURKISH VILLA ANTALYA TURKEY - DAY

A dozen horses ride through the lush countryside of Antalya
Mohammed and his guard As they approach the estate house
Radu rides out to meet them

RADU
This is a surprise

MOHAMMED
I wanted to congratulate you both
on your news You will be an
excellent father

RADU
Sofia will be delighted to see you
She’s resting but I will wake her

MOHAMMED
Let her sleep another hour give me
the grand tour first

EXT ORCHARDS COUNTRY ESTATE ANTALYA - DAY

Mohammed and Radu walk through groves of fruit trees all in
blossom The distant ocean sparkles in the afternoon sun

MOHAMMED
So you like it here

RADU
Antalya is in an incredible place
Muslims Christians and Jews all
live and work in total harmony

MOHAMMED
Constantinople now has this same
freedom Muslim and Christian pray
side by side I will bring this
same tolerance to the world

RADU
But at what cost To try to achieve
this against people’s will only
leads to bloodshed and subjugation
the very antithesis of freedom and
tolerance

Mohammed is philosophical desensitized to the realities of
war

MOHAMMED
People are malleable they just
need to be led Mine is the better
way Sometimes sacrifices have to
be made for the sake of
improvement

RADU
Easy to say when you make none of
the sacrifices
(A tense beat)
Excuse me I forget myself I left
politics behind the day I married
your sister

MOHAMMED
(Very serious)
Unfortunately not My problems with
your brother have escalated

Radu smiles bitterly now understand the true motive behind
this visit

RADU
I see Tell me what you have come
here to tell me

MOHAMMED
I move for Hungary in the summer
Your brother refuses to honor our
treaty he killed the envoys I sent
to negotiate

RADU
Why are you telling me this What
do you expect me to do about it

MOHAMMED
Nothing but something will need to
be done And when it happens you
will become king of Wallachia

Radu flares shoving Mohammed against a tree
RADU
You do not come to my home and talk

to me of killing my brother

Mohammed’s guards rush up but he waves them off

MOHAMMED
You are heir to the throne and
married to an Ottoman princes Like
it or not you are a part of this

RADU
Listen to me for the last time You
will do as you must as will Vlad
But it has nothing to do with me

Radu turns to leave Mohammed calling after him
MOHAMMED
It is not that simple Radu You

cannot just walk away from this

RADU
I already have

Mohammed watches Radu depart nodding to himself

sweat Suddenly he jolts awake fighting to catch his breath
Quietly he rises and slips out of the room Only now do we
see that Eleanor is awake her face a mask of concern

INT CHAPEL TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT

Vlad kneels at the alter deep in prayer Then for a flash we
are back in Hungary Vlad the Monk raises his crucifix in
defense

Vlad snaps open his eyes haunted by the vision A large

crucifix at the alter taunts him Vlad turns away slowly
removing the crucifix from around his neck

INT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - DAY
Eleanor wakes to find herself alone in bed No flower now
adorns her pillow She turns to the balcony to see Vlad is
sitting there staring off into the distance

Eleanor goes to him running her fingers through his hair

ELEANOR
You could not sleep again

Vlad just shakes his head he cannot even look at her now
Eleanor sits down determined to talk to him

ELEANOR (CONTD)
You have barely said two words to
me since you returned from Hungary

VLAD
I don’t know what to say Eleanor
I killed him he was my brother It
weighs on me

ELEANOR
You did what you had to do for your
family and for your country Think
of the assassin he sent he was not
a brother to you

VLAD
He was just weak and had been
manipulated It made me think of
Radu I have failed them both

ELEANOR
You cannot control the actions of
other men Vlad You are a great
king and a great husband that is
all you need to be

Eleanor turns Vlad’s face so that he is looking directly at
her

ELEANOR (CONTD)
Now you have to stay strong and
continue to set a good example to
the people and to your children

The way Eleanor says this makes Vlad suddenly curious

VLAD
Are you with child

ELEANOR
I’m almost certain

Suddenly all of Vlad’s worries evaporate as he embraces her
They are interrupted by a knock and a YOUNG GUARD enters

YOUNG GUARD
Forgive this intrusion Cazan
requests I inform you that an
Ottoman Envoy has just arrived

VLAD
I will be down momentarily

The guard leaves Even this cannot sour Vlad’s joy

VLAD (CONTD)
Let me deal with this and I will
come straight back I thank God
daily that I found you

There will be more rough times
ahead just remember that we will
always have each other

Inside of the fortress is dark and the passageways narrow
Vlad and Calin are led into a meeting room where Sultan
Mohammed sits with his Envoy and General

Up close to the Sultan Vlad realizes that it is in fact a
DOPPELGANGER He is identical to Mohammed accept for one
crucial detail he does not have the SCAR

Vlad draws his sword Calin follows suite

Armed guards rush in from every door an ambush Vlad and
Calin are forced to drop their weapons The Envoy appears to
be exceedingly pleased with himself

arrested for breach of Treaty

The General steps forward attempting to guide Vlad out of
the room Vlad stops him with a steady hand

I do not think you are in any
position to be making threats Send

Vlad and Calin are roughly escorted from the room

EXT COURTYARD SILISTRA BULGARIA - NIGHT

Vlad and Calin sit on unsaddled horses their hands bound
behind their backs They are surrounded by Ottoman soldiers
who are readying themselves for departure

Calin leans back on his horse and howls into the night like a
wolf The howl echoes off of the fortress walls

OTTOMAN GUARD
Shut up

EXT FORTRESS SILISTRA BULGARIA - NIGHT

The gates of the fortress creak open and the Ottoman party
file out Vlad and Calin share a nod and spur their horses
They lunge forward barreling past the guards and out onto
the frozen Danube

As they hit the ice their horses lose traction sliding to a
stop twenty feet from the bank The Ottoman soldiers dismount
and draw their swords slowly approaching

Then from the darkness comes a strange SKITTERING SOUND like
metal on ice and a sword slides up to Calin’s feet He picks
it up cutting their binds

The Ottoman soldiers huddle together as a chorus of howls
fill the air around them Then men start appearing from the
darkness Suddenly the Ottoman are fighting for their lives

soldiers litter the ice The Envoy and Mohammeds

MOHAMMED
This was not your fault

RADU
There is no act without reason I
have sinned too much to be allowed
that dream I should have walked
away

MOHAMMED
You loved each other you followed
your hearts There is no sin in
that

RADU
And Converting to another God is
there sin in that Fighting against
your own people is there sin in
that That is what I am being
punished for

Radu gathers himself Mohammed presses on

MOHAMMED
So what will you do now

RADU
I will wait quietly to join them in
the afterlife

MOHAMMED
Foolishness You feel you have
sinned against your God and people
then make amends for it Start
accepting your responsibilities

bank of Bulgaria destroying towns
and recruiting my subjects for his

Now he and Stephen are camped on
the bank of Wallachia waiting for

for good I am offering you one
last chance to end this quietly

Radu stands furious

RADU
My wife is three weeks in the
ground and you come here to ask me
to kill my brother

MOHAMMED
Or convince him to surrender

RADU
He would never surrender to me

MOHAMMED
Then perhaps you should kill him
better one man dead than thirty
thousand I am sure another
preventable massacre of your people
will lie heavily on your
conscience

RADU
And that way you keep your army
fresh for Hungary For all the pain
I feel I would not trade it for
your vile existence

Mohammed cares little about the judgement of his old friend

One way or another Vlad will be
gone and you will be king It is

Months have passed The Danube has thawed and an army of
thirty thousand Christian soldiers are assembled on its bank
They work TENDING CROPS and DIGGING TRENCHES Occasional
glances are cast over the Danube When will the Ottoman come

As more time passes the dense WHEAT CROPS that surround the
camp begin to flourish in the PARTICULARLY HOT EARLY SUMMER
Men work on their knees spreading straw then burlap at the
base of the wheat

Vlad waits on a sandy shore As Radu arrives Vlad excitedly
pulls him into a tight embrace

Welcome back brother Have you come

RADU
I have come to negotiate

Vlad deflates covering his disappointment with hostility

RADU (CONT’D)
Please Vlad let us work together
and find a way to resolve these
problems peacefully

VLAD
You mean surrender

RADU
To fight is madness You are facing
an army of over a hundred thousand
men If you surrender now and I can
convince Mohammed to let you keep
your throne Father made the right
choice in your position

VLAD
Our father was buried alive for
that decision You never saw
Wallachia Radu It was destroyed
our people were starving

RADU
You did not see Constantinople
Mohammed slaughtered their army in
under a day

VLAD
They died for their beliefs as we
are willing to It is a question of
patriotism and faith I would not
expect you to understand

RADU
This is not about you or I or
faith It is about saving the lives
of sixty thousand men

VLAD
Then tell your Sultan not to invade
my country That is the only way
this ends peacefully Radu

Radu sighs heavily searching for a way to connect with Vlad

RADU
All you have ever wanted was a
family and to rule your country
You have a chance to keep it all

VLAD
But to live as an Ottoman slave
none of it would mean anything

RADU
It would mean something to your
child Do you not wish to see him
at least once before you die

VLAD
I would rather he grow up with the
memory of a man willing to die for
his beliefs than live with a coward
willing to compromise everything

RADU
Then he will grow up just as angry
as you and this will go on forever

VLAD
Just until the Ottoman realize they
cannot take away our freedom

They have obviously reached a stale mate
VLAD (CONTD)
Don’t come back here Radu Let

Mohammed and I settle this now

RADU
This is not only the way Vlad

defeat them

CAZAN
My kings I have faced the Ottoman
with an army over twice this size
and they destroyed us I urge you
to explore your other options

VLAD

You fought Murad Mohammed is not
his father I know I can beat him

(Referencing the map)
Every past war has been fought
protecting the Danube
concentrating our forces in one
small area With the bigger army
they will always win

CAZAN
Exactly

VLAD
So we let them in Invading is
easy occupying a hostile country
is very difficult We let them in
and use their numbers against them

CAZAN
If we let them in thousands of
civilians will die

VLAD
Most of our men have already come
to join the fight the women and
children we will evacuate to the
north
Cazan is not convinced he looks to Stephen

trench dug twenty feet from the bank of the Danube He peers
into the blackness over the river then glances to his side
and we see that he is joined by the ENTIRE CHRISTIAN ARMY

Across the trench Vlad rides out to face them

VLAD
Today the Sultan sent his best
negotiator my brother to offer us
another treaty When I did not
accept they tried to kill me What
does that tell you I think these
slags are afraid to fight us

The men roar and cheer

VLAD (CONT’D)
Twelve years ago my father
surrendered without a fight Many
of you thought that was a mistake
ten years of slavery confirmed it
Now we are free again and they want
to take that from us simply because
they have a bigger army I say come
and try

More cheers Calin grins

VLAD (CONT’D)
I fought Mohammed once man to man
He was in the infirmary for a
month One of us is worth ten of
them for we have a reason to
fight We fight as vengeance for
ten years of slavery We fight
because it is our duty to protect
Christendom We fight because we
are Wallachians and no one will
rule us

The men roar with enthusiasm Vlad nods to Calin who bends
forward and dips his ARROW into a FLAMING POT OF OIL The
rest of the soldiers follow suit

Calin draws back and releases his ARROW which is immediately
followed by thirty thousand more their flames illuminating
the sky Now we see the Danube is filled with HUNDREDS OF
OTTOMAN LONG BOATS

Vlad jumps the trench joining Calin and Stephen

CALIN
Nice speech

Stephen watches apprehensively as arrows to rain down upon
the Ottoman claiming the first victims of this battle

EXT CHRISTIAN CAMP BANK OF THE DANUBE - NIGHT

Ottoman soldiers rush the Wallachian bank diving into the
trench to avoid the merciless arrows As they scramble to
climb out of the other side the first line of Christian
soldiers charge forward cutting them down

Arrows continue raining down upon the approaching Ottoman
boats But soldiers keep coming and soon thousands are
flooding into the trench As it becomes difficult to hold
them Stephen rushes to Vlad

STEPHEN
I think we should call the retreat

Vlad nods and Stephen signals the HORN MAN who blows the
call to retreat and the Christian army disappear back into
the dense crops that surround the battle field

Ottoman soldiers continue to pour onto Wallachia shielding
themselves from the last volley of arrows as they wait for
the next command

OTTOMAN GENERAL
Pursue

They rush forward into the tall crops As hundreds disappear
into the wheat another volley of FLAMING ARROWS descend upon
them The arrows ignite the previously oil soaked ground
turning the fields of crops into a flaming inferno The
Ottoman soldiers burn and scream but cannot escape as they
are trapped against a wall of their arriving countrymen

MASTIS
Sire our water supplies run very
low It is my advice that we rest
here and replenish supplies before
advancing

MOHAMMED
Fine send a party to the Danube
While we wait you will head north
and formulate a plan to end this
quickly I am starting to lose
patience

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP WALLACHIA - DAY
From a distance we see the massive Ottoman army at rest TWO
PARTIES depart the camp The larger group heads south the

smaller goes north

Vlad lowers his eyeglass and we see that it is from his point
of view that we have seen this He turns to Calin

VLAD
You want the big one or the small
one

CALIN
The small

Vlad grins and climbs down from his high perch revealing five
thousand of his men laying in wait

EXT BANK OF THE DANUBE WALLACHIA - DUSK

The LARGE OTTOMAN PARTY hurriedly fill many containers with
water nervous in their work One man stops working peering

off into the gloom Then another man begins to stare

Vlad and three thousand of his men have surrounded them
VLAD
Drop your weapons and you will not
be harmed
(They drop their weapons)
You are now prisoners of Wallachia
(To his men)
Take them to Tirgoviste

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP WALLACHIA - DAY

The sun is rising again and tensions are mounting The
SCOUTING PARTIES have yet to return long overdue now Then
Radu sees something on the horizon through the rippling heat

Moments later the DECAPITATED BODY OF MASTIS rides into camp
Radu slows the horse and begins undoing the straps clearly
effected by his brother’s brutality Mohammed strides over

MOHAMMED
I hope you are satisfied

RADU
None of this is my fault

MOHAMMED
You had an opportunity to end this
quietly and you did not take it
All of this is your fault
(Turning to his General)
We should already be moving
General

SADEEK the SECOND GENERAL quickly turns to the men

SADEEK
Were moving Those of you that
have water share it with those
that do not

The last of the water is distributed amongst the soldiers
most do not get any

EXT WALLACHIA BLACKENED PLANES - DAY

The Ottoman move slowly under the merciless afternoon sun it
has been ten hours since most have had water The Carpathian
mountains are now visible in the distance green and lush but

another full days march away One man falters and falls

Sadeek approaches the Sultan’s carriage

SADEEK
Sire the men are exhausted and we
desperately need water I request
that we make camp for the night and
send a party to the mountains for

supplies

MOHAMMED
How do you know they will not be
caught

SADEEK

I do not but we need water or the
men will start dying

Mohammed agrees with a curt nod

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP WALLACHIA - NIGHT

The Ottoman army rest under a bright moon Even the watchman
struggle to stay awake after marching all day with no water

From the black Vlad and Calin creep in through the rows of
tents a hundred of their hardest with them Simultaneously
the men each enter a tent silently slitting the throats of
the occupants Not a sound emerges from any tent The men
regroup and move on to the next row

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP WALLACHIA - LATER

Vlad and Calin have made their way to the center of the camp
where they covertly watch the SULTAN’S TENT

VLAD
Mohammed is right inside that tent
We could finish this now

CALIN
He’s got fifty guards Come on we
left them a nice surprise for the
morning

Calin retreats into the night A moment longer and Vlad
follows him out

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP WALLACHIA - DAWN

Mohammed is livid watching as every tent is checked and

bodies are piled for burial Radu stands nearby listening as
Sadeek gives his report

SADEEK
No one heard anything Sire he’s
like a ghost There are at least
one thousand dead some have
disappeared completely

MOHAMMED
And the water party What happened
to them
SADEEK
No word Sire
MOHAMMED
(Seething)

You must be thirsty here have a
drink of mine

SADEEK
Thank you Sire but I will drink
when the soldiers drink

MOHAMMED
I insist General

Mohammed hands Sadeek his canteen who nervously raises it to
his lips He is about to drink when Mohammed stabs him in the
stomach

MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
Imbecile
(Turning to Radu)
Get my army ready to move

RADU
Your men are ravished with
dehydration Another day of
marching under these conditions
could kill them See sense
Mohammed it is no accident we find
ourselves in this position

MOHAMMED
We are thirty miles from the
Carpathian mountains where we will
rest and hydrate From there
Tirgoviste is a two day march and
Vlad will have nowhere left to run

A tense beat

MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
I told you to get my army ready

RADU
I am not your general

Radu turns his back on Mohammed and helps bury the dead

EXT WALLACHIA BLACKENED PLANES - DAY

The ravaged Ottoman army forge ahead as the sun taunts them
with gentle morning rays Ahead the densely wooded
CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS look like utopia

EXT CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS WALLACHIA - DAY

The Christian army rest on a clearing at the foot of the
mountains The clearing is surrounded on three sides by
forest a stream runs along one side The perfect camp

Cazan arrives hurriedly looking for Vlad He finds him in
the center of the camp talking with Stephen and Calin

VLAD
Is everything alright

CAZAN
The prison is filled to capacity
we can sustain no more men

VLAD
We will send no more we fight
tonight

CAZAN
(Shocked)
Then why take so many prisoners I
hoped you had decided to negotiate

VLAD

The more men in our prisons the
less men we face on the battle
field When we have defeated them
I will sell them back to the Sultan
to raise money to rebuild the
country

CAZAN
You are still outnumbered three-to-
one Vlad It is ludicrous to take
them on in straight battle

STEPHEN
I agree
This hits Vlad like a thunderbolt

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
We should talk about negotiating
Vlad With so many prisoners we
will decide the terms

Vlad swallows his rage pointing to Stephen’s Dragon Pendant

VLAD
Look at that pendant and remember
why your father died I gave you
back your throne and I gave you
back your freedom Now I’m asking
you to trust me

STEPHEN
Of course I trust you but we have
to be realistic There are still at
least eighty thousand of them

VLAD
Their morale is crippled They have
marched for days sick with
dehydration as we rested We strike
tonight at this very spot Kill
Mohammed and the rest will flee

Vlad looks to Calin who nods his unwavering support

VLAD (CONTD)
This was always the plan Stephen

CAZAN
How can you be sure they will come
here

CALIN

They need water and that stream is
the only option for miles

VLAD
We’ve come this far brother It’s
time to finish what they started
We can only do it with your help

Vlad’s eyes bore into Stephen until finally he nods his
compliance

VLAD (CONTD)
Then it’s settled

Vlad walks Cazan back to his horse

VLAD (CONTD)
I need you back in Tirgoviste

CAZAN
Are you sure you know what you’re
doing

VLAD

This ends tonight

Vlad slaps his back reassuringly sending him on his way

EXT CLEARING CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - DUSK

The clearing is now empty as the Ottoman rush in running to
the stream to drink Slowly it transforms into another camp
Row after row of neat tents the Sultan’s Quarters at the

center

EXT CLEARING CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Radu walks through the quiet camp unable to sleep He sits
with a group of NIGHT WATCHMEN who offer him hot tea

A noise in the forest and one of the watchmen peers into the
darkness After a moment he shrugs just an animal

EXT FOREST CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

The Christian army are assembled in the forest Vlad stands
with Calin and Stephen in a moment of silent unity Stephen
is clearly nervous

VLAD
Just keep breathing and keep your
sword moving God is with you

The men embrace before mounting their horses and setting off
in separate directions each leading off a third of the army

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Radu is dozing with the watchmen A WHISTLING NOISE suddenly
fills the air and they are on their feet Then SLAM one of
the watchmen is knocked back down an ARROW through his
shoulder Instantly the camp is in chaos

From the NORTH FOREST Vlad and his men scream down into the
camp slashing and hacking all in their path The unprepared
Ottoman are getting slaughtered

EXT WEST FOREST - NIGHT

Stephen sits before his MOLDAVIAN SOLDIERS watching Vlad’s
charge His old friend the CAPTAIN steps forward

CAPTAIN
It is time to move Sir

Stephen remains motionless watching the massive Ottoman army
beginning to galvanize

STEPHEN
We’re not moving I will not
sacrifice these men I told Vlad
but he would not see sense
(Turning to the battle)
There is no hope of victory here

The Captain is disgusted but he follows his king’s order

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Vlad attempts to fight his way to the SULTAN’S QUARTERS but
the Ottoman are rapidly organizing He looks to the EAST and
WEST desperately needing his reinforcements

Radu finishes arming himself amongst the Sultan’s guard as
Calin thunders in with SEVEN THOUSAND MORE MEN They catch
the Ottoman flank off guard causing utter devastation

Radu surveys the situation turning his attention to the WEST
FOREST Realizing that another strike will be coming from
that direction he turns to a nearby OFFICER

RADU
Assemble as many men as you can and
meet me at the west side of camp

The Officer looks to the quiet forest to the west
understanding Radu’s concern

OFFICER
Yes Sir

Back on Vlad who has found his way to Calin They have a
real fight on their hands as more Ottoman rush in

VLAD
Where the hell is Stephen

CALIN
I don’t know
They both look over to the WEST FOREST where a group of
Ottoman are already beginning to assemble

VLAD
He’s leaving it too late

EXT WEST FOREST - NIGHT

Stephen watches as many more Ottoman line the clearing in
front of them Radu rides through the men peering out into
the gloomy forest Stephen turns to his Captain

STEPHEN
Stay here

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Vlad and Calin are in the fight of their lives as the Ottoman
start to take control Again Vlad looks to the WEST and is
nearly felled by what he sees STEPHEN STANDS TALKING WITH
RADU

Blinded by fury Vlad mounts a horse and gallops recklessly
into the mass of Ottoman soldiers With eyes locked on
Stephen and Radu he is oblivious to all other danger And
BAM an arrow bites into his shoulder

Radu is stunned to see his brother fall Disorientated Vlad
struggles to his feet clumsily defending himself against an
Ottoman soldier Then SLASH Calin cuts the top of the
soldier’s head off before pulling Vlad up onto his horse

CALIN
Retreat Retreat

VLAD
What are you doing

CALIN
Saving your life again We cannot
win now it is time to retreat

Calin gallops through the carnage and up into the forest
taking his king to safety The rest of the army soon follow
disappearing as swiftly as they came

EXT FOREST CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Vlad and Calin regroup with their men in the forest Vlad
climbs onto his own horse
VLAD
We need to get to Tirgoviste

CALIN
You need to rest an hour and
cauterize that wound

VLAD
There is no time We can still beat
them but we need to be prepared

The men are uneasy looking to Calin After a moment he
spurs his horse and they take off again through the forest

EXT OTTOMAN CAMP CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAWN

Through early morning mist Stephen surveys the aftermath
Bodies litter the field a murder of crows circle above
Mohammed stands with Radu and his THIRD GENERAL KOSOVO

KOSOVO
Sire we must stay strong I advise
abandoning this campaign and moving
to Moldavia We can regroup and
invade Hungary from there

MOHAMMED
And what message do you think that
would send to the rest of Europe
We finish this Vlad will not get
the better of me

RADU
As long as you are willing to
accept the responsibility of thirty
thousand more deaths

MOHAMMED

Ironic coming from you Bury our
men and get us ready to march

EXT CASTLE COURTYARD TIRGOVISTE - DAY

Vlad and his remaining ten thousand men arrive at Tirgoviste
Cazan rushes out to meet them

CAZAN
What happened
VLAD
The Ottoman are coming Bring in
the towns people and fortify the
castle for siege

CAZAN
We have no supplies I have been
feeding your prisoners

VLAD
What choice do we have They will
be here by tomorrow Fortify the
castle

Vlad heads inside

CAZAN
What happened

CALIN
It failed Stephen betrayed us

They share a moment reflecting upon the magnitude of the
problem they face

CALIN (CONTD)
I could never have imagined that it
would all come to this I should
have stayed in the forest

CAZAN
Perhaps it’s time you returned Get
some rest I will tend to the men

INT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE WALLACHIA - NIGHT
Vlad rushes in to find Eleanor on their balcony watching the
commotion below her pregnancy clearly visible now She is

shocked to see Vlad’s state ragged and bleeding

ELEANOR
What happened Are you shot again

VLAD
It just pierced my shoulder

Vlad embraces her tightly breathing her in
VLAD (CONTD)
I have longed to have you in my

arms again

But Eleanor shrugs him off confused and scared
ELEANOR
What is happening Vlad Why is the
army here

VLAD
The Ottoman are coming

Eleanor’s shock quickly turns to panic

ELEANOR
When

VLAD
Probably by tomorrow

ELEANOR
We have to leave We can disappear
into the forest they will never
find us

VLAD
If we run we will be running
forever I gave my word to the
people I have to stay and finish
this

ELEANOR
If it were possible to stop them
you would have done it already You
did everything that you could Vlad
now it is time to save your family

VLAD
I cannot turn my back on Wallachia
Eleanor But you should go I will
send Calin with you

Eleanor is starting to cry overcome with fear and
frustration

ELEANOR
Then I am staying too and I will
die with you Or we will raise our
child together from the confines of
a Turkish prison cell I will not
be your widow while you martyr
yourself

VLAD
I am not martyring myself I can
still beat him

ELEANOR
How Vlad How will you beat him
now

Vlad has no answer He covers his breaking heart with a cold
demeanor

VLAD
That is why you must leave
Please understand that I cannot

ELEANOR
I am not leaving without you God
damn you Vlad You swore that you
would not make the same mistakes as
your father but you are so much
worse At least he knew when he was
beaten

VLAD
I thought the point of being a
martyr was that you die so that
your beliefs are never beaten

Eleanor slaps his face

ELEANOR
And the point of being a husband is
that you would do anything to save
your wife and child

Vlad nods a dark resolve forming He regards Eleanor for a
long moment before barreling out of the room

ELEANOR (CONTD)
Where are you going

VLAD
To save my wife and child

EXT CASTLE COURTYARD TIRGOVISTE - DAY

The courtyard is filled to capacity with soldiers resting and
eating Vlad explodes out of the castle and mounts his horse

VLAD
(Barking at the men)
Now is the time for work not rest
or come this time tomorrow you
shall rest an eternity I want
twenty thousand young trees cut and
stripped by sunset

CALIN
What’s going on

VLAD
What do you think The Ottoman are
coming I think it would be prudent
to be prepared for them

With that Vlad about turns and gallops from the courtyard

EXT FOREST CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

The Ottoman make steady progress through the dense forest

EXT FOREST TIRGOVISTE - DAY

Vlad’s men work furiously cutting and stripping small trees
one end is sharpened to a point They are making STAKES

EXT PRISON TIRGOVISTE - DAY

Vlad surveys the cells of OTTOMAN PRISONERS all malnourished
and filthy He beckons for the PRISON GUARD to join him

VLAD
I want these prisoners arranged
into groups of one hundred and
brought to the town common

EXT TOWN COMMON TIRGOVISTE - DAY

On the town common Vlad supervises as the stakes are laid
out in rows A hole is dug at the foot of each Cazan arrives
to witness Calin escorting the first group of prisoners down
to the common

EXT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - DUSK

Eleanor anxiously paces when the silence is abruptly broken
by a WAIL OF AGONY The blood drains from her face as she
goes to the balcony to investigate

EXT TOWN COMMON TIRGOVISTE - DAY

Now we see the cause of the wail as Vlad assists in the
IMPALEMENT of a Ottoman soldier The process is brutal

The greased tip of the stake is rammed into the man’s chest
then several men hoist the stake vertical and slide it into
the pre-dug hole Gravity now takes hold as the weight of the
man causes him to slide down the stake impaling him

The atmosphere is thick a palpable sense amongst the men
that they will never be forgiven for their participation in
these atrocities Vlad approaches Calin both are literally
covered in blood Calin is unable to meet his eye

EXT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - DUSK

Night is falling Eleanor watches the town common where
hundreds of men writhe in terrible pain as the die Haunted
by the gruesome spectacle she drops her robe Tears well in
her eyes as she touches her swollen belly

ELEANOR
I’m sorry

Vlad enters the courtyard below as Eleanor climbs up onto the
balcony wall He looks up instantly panicked

VLAD
What are you doing

ELEANOR
Where could we go from here Vlad

Eleanor closes her eyes and allows herself to fall backwards
She drops gracefully for a split second before hitting the
ground with a CRUNCH Vlad rushes to her cradling her broken
body The frightened townspeople look on in horror

EXT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT
Vlad carries Eleanor into their chambers gently lowering her

onto their bed He brushes the hair from her face and holds
her hand laying his head on her lap

EXT CASTLE COURTYARD TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT

Calin sits in the courtyard with his men broken by the death
of his sister and his participation in this massacre The men
quietly debate around him

MAN
Half our soldiers have already
left I don’t want to stay here to
die We did what we could
MAN TWO
Youre right If that spectacle
doesn’t stop them all of us are
going to end up on those spikes

Cazan joins the group and the men quiet down

CAZAN
No need to stop I agree I think
it is time to return to the forest

Calin and Cazan hold each others gaze for a long time

INT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT

Vlad has fallen asleep Calin enters quietly coming to the
side of their bed Lightly he kisses Eleanor placing his
small Crucifix in her hand

CALIN
Goodbye beautiful girl

A tear rolls from Calin’s chin as Cazan appears at the
doorway Calin looks at his old friend Knowing that Vlad
would never come with them he slips back out of the room

EXT TOWN COMMON TIRGOVISTE - DAWN

In the morning light we see the full horror of Vlad’s last
stand Eighteen thousand impaled Ottoman stretch from one end
of the common to the other row after row on progressively
taller stakes They create a human wall of defense History
will dub this ‘THE FOREST OF THE IMPALED’

Radu Mohammed and what is left of the Ottoman army look on
in acute horror Mohammed drops to his knees in Prayer

MOHAMMED
Forgive me Allah my pride has
blinded me Forgive me for the
lives of these men

Mohammed turns to look at the faces of his soldiers who stand
at the precipice of the forest He sees them for the first
time flesh and blood Exhausted and scared

MOHAMMED (CONTD)
You were right the price of
victory is too high This is where
it ends

Radu looks at the carnage slowly shaking his head

RADU
No if you stop now every life lost
on this campaign will have been for
nothing

MOHAMMED
And I will live with that for the
rest of my life But I have lost
half of my army I can afford to
lose no more This is too much

RADU
Which is why it can never happen
again You two will never stop
fighting There will be twenty more
wars thousands more will die

MOHAMMED
But not today

RADU
(Gesturing the dead)
Look at your men You cannot let
this happening again Let me finish
this

Mohammed looks at the rows of dead soldiers finally nodding
his agreement

MOHAMMED
You have twenty-four hours No
negotiations By sunrise tomorrow I
want to see a one of these stakes
through Vlad’s heart

Radu looks sadly at the castle

RADU
He will fall fighting to save the
castle
(Turning back to Mohammed)
When I am king I rule Wallachia my
way We will have peace

Mohammed musters a smile and nods

INT ROYAL CHAMBERS CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT

Vlad sleeps at peace for a moment then CRUNCH A noise
jolts him awake Vlad keeps his eyes shut a moment longer
before finally confronting Eleanor’s body When he does he
sees Calin’s crucifix Then again it comes CRUNCH

Vlad climbs unsteadily to his feet and crosses to the
balcony The courtyard below is EMPTY everyone has left him
Vlad quietly absorbs his fate Then again CRUNCH and the
castle gates buckle

EXT OUTER CASTLE WALLS TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT

The BATTERING RAM rolls one more time and the gates crack
open Ottoman soldiers rush into the courtyard ready to
fight only to find it empty

Radu pushes through the men as a CLAPPING begins to echo off
of the walls All look up to see Vlad standing on his balcony
railing The Ottoman soldiers surge forward

RADU
Halt Stay were you are No one
enters the castle but me

VLAD
I will meet you in the war room

Vlad disappears back into the castle

INT WAR ROOM CASTLE TIRGOVISTE - NIGHT

Radu enters the war room apprehensively to find Vlad slumped
on his thrown his breathing laboured Absentmindedly he
twirls the Toledo Blade

VLAD
You finally came home

RADU
You gave me no choice How could
you do that to those men

VLAD
An arrow the sword impalement
what difference does it make They
invaded my country and they got
what they deserved

RADU
No one deserves that This whole
war was for nothing Here we are
again negotiating Only now
seventy thousand men have died and
I can no longer save you
VLAD
This is the way it always had to
be Radu What is to be my fate

RADU
Impalement at sunrise

VLAD
Fitting My wife is dead can I
rely on you to give her a proper
burial

RADU
I will see to it You can stay here
until dawn I’1l send in a priest

Vlad smiles

VLAD
Do you think God will forgive me
for the things I’ve done

RADU
I ask myself the same question

Radu looks sadly at his brother before slowly turning away
As he reaches the door Vlad calls after him

VLAD
I love you Radu in spite of
everything

And he tosses the Toledo Blade to his brother
VLAD (CONTD)
Remember who you are this country

needs you now

RADU
I know what this country needs

They regard each other a moment longer before Radu forces
himself to leave We stay on Vlad sitting injured and alone
EXT TOWN COMMON TIRGOVISTE - DAWN

The sky is red as the sun rises over Wallachia Fires roar on
the town common warming the Ottoman soldiers who quietly

bury their dead

All work stops as Vlad is led down to the common he once
again wears his FATHER’S CRUCIFIX
Soldiers heckle and spit on him as he passes Radu is
devastated watching his brother walk to his death He rushes
to Mohammed

RADU
I beg you to spare him for me

MOHAMMED
You know I cannot do that

RADU
Let him rot in a prison for the
rest of his life that would be
worse for him anyway Please
Mohammed I cannot watch him die

MOHAMMED
Then do not watch but my men
demand this

RADU
You care not what your men want
Show the world that you are the
better man Do not stoop to his
level Prove you are the better
man Mohammed

Mohammed looks at the pain and desperation in his friend’s
face likes the idea of being the better man

MOHAMMED
If he will bow to me he can spend
the rest of his life in prison

Radu nods his thanks and rushes over to Vlad A stake has
been laid out in front of him and the whole army has gathered
around eager to watch the execution

RADU
Mohammed will spare you if you bow
to him

VLAD

That would erase everything that I
have done

RADU
Nothing could erase that You did
everything that you could Take
solace in that and live out the
rest of your life in peace

Vlad is touched by his brother’s grief but shakes his head
VLAD
I cannot do that Radu

Mohammed enters the circle and all bow all but Vlad General
Kosovo approaches

KOSOVO
The Sultan is willing to spare your
life if you will swear your
alliance to the Empire and bow to
him now

The Ottoman soldiers boo and holler their objections as
Stephen pushes his way through the crowd Vlad shakes his
head refusing to bow

RADU
Please Vlad

STEPHEN
For Gods sake Vlad just bow

Seeing Stephen oddly strengthens Vlad’s resolve He touches
his brother’s face Then instead of bowing Vlad raises his
arms and puts back his head making the sign of the cross

Mohammed nods to Kosovo and the STAKE IS RAMMED INTO VLAD’S
CHEST The stake is then hoisted vertical and slid into its
hole The Ottoman soldiers cheer

We stay on Radu as he walks away from the crowd He brushes
the tears from his face looking up to the bright red sky

As we fade to Black script runs

That night Vlad’s body disappeared
his final resting place is still
unknown

Radu finally brought peace to
Wallachia He negotiated the first
treaty between the Hungarian and
Ottoman Empires The Ottoman never
advanced any further into Europe

Vlad would be remembered forever
By some as the warrior king who
led the last crusade But by most
as the blood sucking legend that
his life inspired

DRACULA
