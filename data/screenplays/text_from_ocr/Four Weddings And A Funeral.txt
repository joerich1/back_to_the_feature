Chapter 1 The First Wedding

You are invited to the wedding of Angus and Laura

on May 1st at StJohns Church Stoke Clandon Somerset

Its Angus and Lauras wedding day and Charles is going to be
their best man The best man has to look after the bridegroom
and give him the wedding ring The best man also has to be at
the church on time but Charles is never punctual He is not even
awake yet The alarm clock rings loudly next to his bed He
reaches out his hand turns it off and goes back to sleep

The wedding is in the west of England which is at least two
or three hours by car from London where Charles lives Some of
his other friends are awake though Theyll be at the wedding
before Charles In their large fine house Tom and Fiona are up
and getting ready to go They are brother and sister and they
come from a very rich family They are opposite types of people
Fiona is a tall elegant and clever womanTom is a happy but not
very intelligent man

Tom enjoys his food and hes now eating a large breakfast
while Fiona chooses what to wear Finally she zips herselfinto a
smart dress She goes downstairs to the dining-room and the
maid gives her a cup of black coffee She quickly drinks it and
they set off Its Saturday so the traffic is not too bad but they
mustnt delay any longer

On their way out of London they call for Gareth and
Matthew who live together in an attractive country-style house
Matthew is a cool but kind sympathetic person - a Scotsman in
his thirties Gareth is a large fat man ofabout forty-five His hair
is a little grey but his beard is still black He likes to wear quite

elegant but very bright clothes He loves to joke and is often
quite rude to other people Gareth and Matthew are boyfriends

Late Youre late’ he shouts pointing at his watch But Tom
and Fiona know Gareth well and dont take any notice

They are not as late as Charles though who is still asleep
Finally the sun shines on to him through the bedroom curtains
and he wakes up He takes the alarm clock offthe table near his
bed and looks at it

Oh God he says He is really awake this time

Charles is thirty-three years old good-looking and always
late He jumps out of bed and rushes in to Scarletts bedroom
Charles and Scarlett share a flat together They are friends but not
lovers Her room is a terrible mess - there are clothes
everywhere He picks up her red alarm clock and puts it under
her nose She opens her eyes sleepily

‘Oh hell’

Scarlett is twenty-five lively and a real London girl You can
hear it in her voice — shes certainly not from an upper-class
family

They hurry to get ready and run out to the car carrying some
of their formal wedding clothes with them The car is Charless
and its very old The engine wont start

Oh God Oh hell’ says Charles Right wed better take
yours’

Mine says ScarlettBut it only goes at forty miles an hour’

Charles drives her car so fast along the motorway that it
shakes It is a very small red car and its also very old and rusty
The engine makes a terrible noise Scarlett cant have looked after
it very well

What road are we looking for asks Charles

Scarlett has a map but she hasnt looked at it yet She picks it
up just as they pass a motorway exit sign

I hope its not the B359 Charles says when he sees the sign
behind him
Scarlett finds the right place on the map ‘Its the B359 she
says proudly

Damn says Charles He suddenly puts his foot on the brake
and starts to drive backwards along the motorwayThere is a lorry
coming up fast behind them and there is nearly a terrible
accident Charles turns the car on to the exit road

‘Oh hell and damn he says again
¢

It is a beautiful sunny day not long after noon as they arrive at
the small church in the peaceful countryside The church bells are
ringing and all the other guests are already inside Charles and
Scarlettjump out ofthe car Charles hasnt finished dressing and
neither has Scarlett They quickly put on the rest of their
wedding clothes For Charles its a formal suit But Scarlett is
wearing a bright orange dress with purple around the waist and
an orange hat to match Charles tries to help her do it up at the
back but the zip gets stuck

‘Hell hellish hell says Charles pulling at the zip

‘Damn and hell says Scarlett She tries to get his tie straight
A very large smart car drives up behind themThe bride is coming

She gets out ofthe car in her beautiful white wedding dress
One of her bridesmaids helps her They are both holding
wonderful bunches of flowers

‘Oh no Charles says and they begin to run towards the
church They smile and wave at the bride as they pass her

The church is full of flowers and all the women guests are
wearing elegant hats Charles and Scarlett look around and finally
see their friends Fiona and Tom Gareth and Matthew They go
over to them

Fiona says to Charles There is a sort of greatness in your
lateness

Thanks Charles replies I have to work hard at it you know
Scarlett sits down with them but Charles puts a pink flower in
the buttonhole ofhis jacket and walks on up the church to Angus
the bridegroom who is waiting nervously for his best man

Sorry sorry’ says Charles Theres no excuse I know Ill kill
myself afterwards if you like

‘It doesnt matter’ says Angus Ifyou hadnt come Tom would
have taken your place

‘Thanks Tom - youre wonderful What a terrible haircut
though Charles jokes

You havent forgotten the ring have you asks Angus The
best man is always given the ring to bring to the church

No no ofcourse not Charles touches his pocket confidently
But he is secretly alarmed Where is the ring When Angus isnt
looking he searches for it in his pockets but they are all empty
Oh God He must have left it at home

Just then an attractive girl in a large black hat and white jacket
walks into the church

Charles and several other guests turn to look at her

Late says CharlesI hate it when people are late Hate it

This makes Angus smile a little and he seems less nervous now
Then the wedding music starts

Here we go says Charles and Angus turns round to look at
his bride who is walking up the aisle towards him Laura is
holding on to her fathers arm and shes wearing a very expensive
white wedding dress She has two little bridesmaids and one
older bridesmaid a young woman called Lydia

Oh isnt she beautiful’ breathes Scarlett

Youre blind’ says Fiona sharply She looks like a big white
cake

Dear friends I am so happy to welcome you here today’ the
priest begins the service Welcome to our church on this
wonderful day for Angus and Laura’

But Charles is looking around him wondering what to do
about the ringWhen he sees the girl in the black hat he starts to
think about other things — shes very attractive Then he
remembers that there is a more urgent problem Everyone is
singing now He tries to make one ofhis friends notice him but
has no luck

At last Matthew looks at him Charles points at his own ring
finger and the pain on his face tells Matthew what the problem is

Please Help me Charles silently makes the words with his
lips

Matthew whispers to Gareth but Gareth holds out both hands
to show that there is no ring on them He whispers to Fiona and to
several more friends too None ofthem is wearing a ring Charles
will be in big trouble The singing is coming to an end now

Scarlett is singing very loudly and enthusiastically but not very
well Matthew interrupts her

Scarlett whispers Matthew She is their last hope She smiles
back at him innocentlyWhen the priest begins to read the next
words ofthe service Matthew nods to Charles — yes theyve got
something

Tll be back in a moment Charles says to the groom who
looks alarmed

The priest continues to speak Do you promise to love
her while Charles goes down the side ofthe church to find
Matthew

Angus the bridegroom is saying I do

Matthew hands something to Charles and Charles looks
surprised at what Matthew has given him

‘Its the best I could do’ whispers Matthew

Charles rushes back to the front ofthe church

Do you have the ring asks the priest

When he sees it he is quite surprised too Angus puts the ring
on to his brides finger It is in the shape of a large brightly-

coloured plastic heart
While the happy couple are signing their names at the back of
the church the brides sister and her boyfriend come forwards
with a guitar to sing pop music Its an old Barry Manilow song

Gareth holds his head in his hands Then he pretends to shoot
himself He is letting everybody know that it is one ofthe most
terrible things he has ever heard

At last its time to leave the church When the bride the
groom and the guests walk out of the church they look very
happy Everybody is smiling and chatting Charles catches up
with the girl in the black hat outside

Thats a great hat he says

Thanks — I bought it specially she smiles at him He can hear
from her accent that shes American

Now its time for the wedding photos The photographer
arranges the bride the groom and the family in groups for the
different pictures A little boy spoils one ofthem when he tries to
hide under the big skirts ofthe brides wedding dress He thinks
its funny — but the others dont

Charles and his friends all get together in their own group to
chat Theres Matthew and Gareth theres Fiona and Tom and of
course the lively Scarlett Theres Charless brother David too
who is deafand communicates in sign language using his hands
And theres also Bernard who is Toms best friend — he is like
Toma kind man but not very clever

Tom enjoyed the wedding and so did Bernard

I thought it was good very good says Tom What did you
think’

Oh yes apod very good replies Bernard

Scarlett says Gareth what an amusing dress Purple for the
Christian church and orange for the wild natural world Just like
the meaning ofthe wedding itself dont you think

Yes — thats right’ says Scarlett who doesnt really know what

he means
Does anybody know asks Charles who the girl in the black
hat is’

They all look at her She is standing not far away talking to
somebodys grandmother

‘Her names Carrie’ says Fiona

‘Shes pretty’ says Charles

‘Awful girl’ says Fiona Shes American She used to work at
Vogue the fashion magazine She lives in America now and she
only goes out with very smart elegant people So you can forget
about her Charles

Fiona is not completely serious

‘Its a good thing you told me says Charles who knows this
Thanks

The bride and groom leave the guests and get into their car
They look very happy People wave at them as the car is being
driven away

Right says GarethIts time for the reception
¢

The guests have to walk through a farm to get to the reception
It is very pretty but Tom steps in some cow mess

Did any ofyou do this too he asks looking at his shoe

‘Typical’ says FionaOnly my brother could do that’

‘Well’ said Tom I might find love at the reception There
might be a really nice girl there I dont want to spoil my good
luck with a horrible smell’

He stops to clean his shoe and the others walk on towards the
house The bride and groom and their families are standing
outside in a line Everybody has to shake their hands and
congratulate them as they go past

I never know what to say’ says Fiona

A magazine which is very famous in Britain and America
‘Its easy Just say You must be very proud Matthew advises
her Thats what everyone says

God no says Fiona

They walk up the line

You must be very proud ofyour daughter’ says Fiona as she
shakes the hand ofthe brides father

The reception is being held in a very large and smart tent on
the grass at the front ofthe house It is full of flowers and looks
very beautiful The guests are elegant too but in a comfortable
not too rich way Most ofthe men are wearing dark suits and a
lot of the women have dresses with flowers on them The drinks
are being served by waiters and waitresses and at the back ofthe
tent the band is getting ready to play

Charles pushes through the crowd trying to find Carrie But
when he finally sees her she is already talking to a good-looking
man

The rat says Charles He goes back to the drinks table and
takes two glasses of wine When he turns round again she is
alone He offers her a drink

Oh — hello’ he says brightlyDo you want one ofthese’

Thank you Carrie replies

Charles badly wants to talk to her but he cant think of
anything to say

Ah- mmm —

The situation is father embarrassing for them both

Before he can think of something another man joins them
This is John who is about thirty-eight but behaves like a man of
sixty He is very formal

Hello Charles’ he says

Ah hello dearJohn — how are you This is

Carrie answers Carrie for him

Im delighted to meet you My names John

They are all silent for a moment — who is going to speak
first Charles decides to be the first

SoJohn hows that lovely girlfriend ofyours

Shes not my girlfriend now he replies stiffly

Oh dear — well dont be sad I heard that she was still seeing
old Toby de Lisle She needed two men you know’

She is now my wife’ says John even more stiffly

The situation is now even more embarrassing than before

Excellent excellent’ says Charles very uncomfortablyMay I
congratulate you And is there the sound of little feet yet You
know - babies and all that No Oh well plenty oftime for that
isnt there’

Excuse me’ says Carrie amused She walks away

Charles tells himself that he is a fool If he hadnt said those
stupid things Carrie wouldnt have gone andJohn wouldnt have
been hurt He hits his head against a tree on purpose then tries to
say hello to an old lady who is walking past She thinks he is crazy

Fiona has found a man called Gerald to talk to He looks
innocent but a bit strange too He is wearing a dark suit and a
black pullover

What do you do she asks him

‘Im studying to be a priest’ he answers

Good God says FionaDo you do weddings

Not yet — I will do later of course Itll make me very
nervous I can tell you He laughs uncomfortably

‘Thats just like the first time one has sex isnt it’ Fiona says
sweetly

Gerald is even more embarrassed now Ah — well I suppose
so —

Not so much mess though Fiona continues but Gerald cant
reply at all now

David has come over to talk to Charles his brother Charles
knows sign language for the deaf very well and has

communicated like this with David since they were children
How are you doing David asks with his hands

Do you remember that time when we were playing with the
engine on Dads motor boat and my leg was almost cut off

Yes

Well this is worse

Somebody has been watching David — a pretty girl with long
red hair She is wearing a bright yellow hat Her name is Serena
She points at David

Whos that boy over there in the grey suit’ she asks Matthew

His names David’ Matthew answers

Hes very attractive isnt he she says

Yes — Ive always thought so

Why are they using their hands like that’ she asks

He cant hear Hes deaf’ says Matthew

‘Oh — good heavens’

‘Silent but very attractive’ Matthew continues

And now the father ofthe bride tells everyone that dinner is
being served He asks them to go into the tent and sit down
They all find their way to their tables John sits down next to his
wife not as happy with her as he was earlier now that he knows
about Toby de Lisle Carrie sits next to George another stiff and
boring type ofman who read a piece from the Bible very loudly
at the wedding service Scarlett sits down next to a complete
stranger and gives him a big kiss on the mouth

Hi — my names Scarlett Dont let me drink too much — I get
much too friendly

Charles as best man has to sit on the top table with the family
He sits down next to an old man who looks annoyed

‘How do you do — my name is Charles

‘Dont be stupid the old man says angrily Charles died
twenty years ago

‘Well that must be a different Charles’

‘Are you telling me that I dont know my own brother
Charles can see that the old man is obviously mad
No no of course not Charles says hurriedly and tries not to

have any more conversation with him
¢

Dinner is served and everybody begins to eat Laura the bride is
very happy and laughs and talks with everyone near her Even
Angus is smiling which is unusual for him In England it is a
custom for the best man to make a speech and at last its time for
Charles to stand up He hits his glass loudly with a spoon and
people stop eating and talking Charles is nervous

‘Ladies and gentlemen Im sorry to take you away from your
conversation and the wonderful food but there are a few things
that I need to say This is only the second time that I have ever
been a best man I hope that I did the job well the first time
Well the bride and groom are still talking to me Unfortunately
though theyre not talking to each other

But people say that Im not guiltyYes I did say in my speech
that Piers the groom had slept with Paulas younger sister But
Paula knew this already — she really did She was a bit surprised
to hear that he had also slept with her mother But I dont think
their violent two-day marriage broke up because ofthat I really
dont think so’

Most people burst out laughing at the joke - Carrie is one of
them — and some clap but there are a few straight faces

But of course Im here today to talk about Angus and he has
nothing to hide has he Well thats what I thought at first

People are still laughing as Charles becomes serious for a
moment

‘Id like to say that I do think very highly of people who get
married like Angus and Laura Marriage is a big step to take and
I know I couldnt do it But I think its wonderful that they can

Now back to Angus and those sheep’
Everybody laughs and claps and then Charles asks them to

raise their glasses and drink to Angus and Laura

¢

After the formal dinner and speeches its time to danceThe band
plays and Laura and Angus as bride and groom are the first to
come out on to the dance floor Laura enjoys herself and dances
in a very lively manner but Angus moves stiffly Perhaps hes
never heard pop music before Scarlett and Tom dance together
They are both enthusiastic dancers Scarlett dances wildly and
Tom very badly but they enjoy themselves enormously Gareth is
dancing like a madman

When I first saw Gareth dance Matthew tells Charles I
thought to myself People will be killed Lives will be lost

But Charles is not really concentrating on what Matthew is
saying He is looking for CarrieWhen he sees her she is already
dancing with another man

Shes pretty isnt she’ Matthew notices that Charles is looking
at her Is it love

This may be true but Charles is surprised and alarmed to hear
Matthew say it

‘Oh good God no — no its the man that shes dancing with I
was at school with him Im just trying to remember his name
But - well ifone did meet somebody nice at a wedding — are
there men who could ask a girl to go out with them at once On
the same day I mean

‘Ifthere are’ said Matthewtheyre not English’

‘Exactly’ said Charles I mean - it usually takes me about
three weeks to ask

By about nine oclock its getting dark and the bride and
groom are almost ready to leave Laura has drunk a lot by now
and she is enthusiastically kissing some of her distant cousins

who she doesnt really know

‘They promised me sex’ says Lydia ‘Everybody said it If youre a

bridesmaid youll get sex they said ‘But has it happened No it

hasnt Nobody has been near me

You know that I love youJean dont you she asks almost in
tears She puts her arms around Jean I love you I love you and
Mike very much Ive never met you before but I love you both
I really do

‘Dont worry says Angus her new husband Shes drunk Well
I hope she is — or Im in real trouble’

Back in the tent Lydia the young woman who was a
bridesmaid at the marriage service is sitting with her head in her
hands She looks depressed She is still wearing her bridesmaids
dress and the flowers around her head

‘Hows it going Lyds asks Bernard

AwfulJust awful’ complains Lydia

‘Oh dear Whats the problem’

They promised me sex’ says Lydia Everybody said it If
youre a bridesmaid youll get sex they said All the men will
want you Youll have to fight them off But has it happened
No it hasnt Nobody has been near me

Well look said Bernard a little shy now I mean — ifyou
like - I could —

Dont be stupid Bernard Im not desperate’ answers Lydia
sharply

No no of course not — sorry - I just thought - Bernard

replies hurriedly
o

When the bride and groom are finally ready to get in their car
Laura throws her bunch offlowers at the guests The person who
catches it will be the next person to get married - or so people
believe Scarlett raises her hand to catch it but fails Fiona steps
out ofthe way And Lydia is the one who catches it

The car has a string of tins tied to it and rude things written
on it This is the custom at English weddings But when Angus
and Laura open the door a large white sheep jumps out with a
bell tied around its neck Everybody laughs They all wave and
shout goodbye as the happy couple are being driven away They
are going on their honeymoon

Charles is sad though as he goes back into the tentThe band
is playing Love is All Around Obviously he feels that its not
true for him Later on his group of friends begin to make their
arrangements for the night

Where are you staying tonight Charles asks Tom

Scarlett and I are going to some pub — The Lucky Boat
Something like that Arent we all staying there

Well no - the plan has changed The others are all coming
back to my place Nansys there — you know our lovely old

servant Shell probably cook us some bacon and eggs when we
get there and we could play some games Would you like to
come too

Yes excellent thanks very much Is there a room for Scarlett
too

Oh of course — weve got a hundred and thirty-seven rooms
actually’

Toms place is his family castle The house in London is not
their only home

Tom asks Charlesare you the richest man in England

Oh — no no I believe were number seven on the list Well
the Queen comes first obviously And that Richard Branson man
is doing very well with his pop music and his aeroplanes Well
excellent news - Im glad that youre coming Ill go and tell
Scarlett’

Suddenly Carrie appears next to Charles

Hi says Charles surprised T thought youd gone

No — not yet I was just wondering — where are you staying
tonight

‘Well I was going to stay at some pub -The Lucky Boat

‘Boatman’ Carrie tells him The Lucky Boatman’

Right But now Im going to stay with some friends at their
house Well I say house but its really an enormous castle

Oh what a shame - because Im staying at the Boatman’

‘Oh says Charles surprised again This is really a perfect
invitation — but he doesnt reply quickly enough He is
unfortunately an Englishman

Well — it was nice to meet youThough we didnt quite meet’
says Carrie T liked your speech — it was great’

Thanks says Charles He still finds it hard to say anything and
they stand there silently together for a moment

‘Im going now Carrie says

Richard Branson a British businessman owns the famous Virgin company

No - dont Couldnt we meet each other now The evenings
just starting’

They both look around at the tent which is now in quite a
mess with bottles and chairs lying on the ground

We both know thats a big lie’ says Carrie and she walks away

‘Hell’ says Charles

The band has stopped playing but the brides sister and
boyfriend are back with their guitar Only four people are trying
to dance now to their music which is not very lively Others are
kissing and a few really drunk people have fallen asleep One of
the pairs that are kissing is Bernard and Lydia They are kissing
very enthusiastically and Lydia is quite breathless

Bernard she cries in surprise I didnt know that it could be
like this’

God says Gareth looking around at all the mess He hates the
music that is being playedWhat a disaster Its time for the castle
How about youTom — are you drunk Can you drive us safely

‘Of course of course’ says Tom Ive had nothing to drink the
whole evening’ But when he stands up he nearly falls over He

must have drunk more than he thinks

The group offriends get into Toms big car and they drive away
through the quiet countryside under the stars Theyre trying to
sing but theyre finding the high bits quite difficult

Charles saysTom can you stop the car

Tom brakes suddenly

‘Sorry’ Charles apologises T think I will go to the pub

But why asks Tom

‘Ah — Charles is uncomfortable and doesnt know exactly
what to say

Everyone makes ajoke ofit

No seriously’ says Charles Im writing about pubs that have

the word boat in their name My book will be the first on the
subject’

Do what you like’ says Tom and Charles jumps out He is
now standing in the dark in the middle ofa road somewhere in
the countryside He suddenly feels very much alone And how is
he going to find this pub

‘Hmm an odd decision says Charles to himself

He sets offin the opposite direction down the dark country
road He does manage to find his way to the pub though by the
time he arrives it is about one oclock in the morning It seems
very quiet in the hotel reception where Charles should check in
Charles is just about to ring the bell on the front desk when he
sees Carrie She is sitting peacefully in a large comfortable chair

‘Hello’ says Charles

She looks at him with a question in her eyes but she is smiling
too

‘Hi

‘There wasnt enough room for everybody’ Charles liesso

You said it was a castle Carrie reminds him

Did I Yes thats true — it is a castle But its a very small one
Only one room upstairs and one room downstairs — very rare’

They both enjoy the joke

A waiter comes in and asks Charles Would you like a drink
sir

Charles orders a drink for himself and one for Carrie too But
when he turns round there is no Carrie — where has she gone
Then George walks down the stairs He is the boring man who
read loudly in church He is whistling and he seems happy
Charles understands

Youre here too says George

‘Hello’ says Charles

You havent seen Carrie have you George is still

speaking loudly

Who asks Charles thinking fast

Carrie American girl Lovely legs Wedding guest Nice smell

No — sorry answers Charles

‘Damn I thought I had a good chance with her’

Suddenly Carries head appears above the sofa where she has
been hiding She makes a terrible face to show that he had no
chance with her at all Only Charles can see fortunately

Look ifyou see her could you tell her that Im in my room
asks George not very pleased

Yes yes’ says Charles hoping that hell go away quickly

Butjust then the waiter comes back with the two drinks

One for you sir’ he says and one for the —

‘One for the road says Charles brightly before the waiter can
say ‘lady’

Actually I think Id like a drink too Can Ijoin you

Yes — lovely idea’ says Charles unhappily

Another drink here and a cigar’ George calls out to the waiter
No lets have a bottle Well drink till daylight eh Charles

Charles sits down on the sofa and George on a chair Charles
knows Carrie is behind the sofa She is trying to escape

Lovely wedding’ says George

Yes says Charles wondering how he can get away

T was at school with Anguss brother Buffy Excellent man
though he liked little boys too much Still it taught me a few of
lifes lessons Where do you know the bride and groom from

Angus and Laura Oh from university’ answers Charles He is
not exactly enjoying the conversation

Yes yes excellent place I didnt go to university myself
though I work in the money markets you knowWhat good are
books there Not much at all

Excuse me sir’ The waiter is back again He has a message for
Charles Your wife asks you to go upstairs at once RoomTwelve

She said that you may be too drunk to remember the number’

My wife asks Charles in surprise

Yes sir the waiter replies

Oh — yes of course my wifeCharles says as he understands

You must be drunk says George You cant even remember
whether youve got a wife

Yes— will you excuse me

Oh yes offyou go Good luck Well I havent got a wife so
Ill go and look for that Katie woman’

Carrie says Charles

Yes thats the oneA fine girl I think I might be lucky there’
¢

Upstairs Charles knocks on the door of number twelve He is
quite nervous Carrie opens it

Hi she says

Hello Im sorry about that

No thats fine — it was impossible to get rid ofhim

Yes — perhaps we should just wander about up here for a bit
then go back down’

‘Thats a thought says Carrie I dont usually wander but I can
wander if I need to Do you wander a lot She is gently joking
with him

No says Charles still nervous Im not really a wanderer — I
dont usually wander a lot but —

Well Carrie says why dont you come in and wander here a
little and then well see

She leads him into the room

‘Its strange’ she says The bride and bridegroom didnt kiss in
the churchWhere I come from kissing is very popular’

‘Is it Yes I think youre right’ Charles is speaking fast I think
English people are probably more shy

‘IL always worry’ continues Carrie that I would go too far in

the church — you know at the place in the marriage service

Carrie kisses Charles on the mouth

where the groom can kiss the bride I might not stop at kissing —

How far is too far’ asks Charles coming very close to her

‘Oh I dont know She gives him a very small kiss on the
cheek That would be all right I think

Yes says Charles That would be fine

‘Perhaps its not enough says Carrie Maybe this would be
better She kisses him on the mouth

Yes But it might be dangerous to go further’ says Charles
nervous again

Then they kiss for a long time

That might be too far says Charles

‘And this asks Carrie It is a few minutes later and they are in
bed making love Do you think the priest might be a little bit

worried about this’

Yes says Charles I think he might be
They kiss again and spend the night together

¢

The pub is in the middle of the countryside It looks very
peaceful in the morning Carrie gets up first and packs When
Charles wakes up she is already zipping up her bag Her face
looks beautiful in the early morning light

‘Whats happening’ asks Charles

‘I have to go she answers

But where to

To America’

‘Thats a tragedy he says

‘But before I go when are you going to tell everybody’
Carrie asks him

Tell everybody’ Charles asks in surprise Tell them what

Well youll tell them that were going to get married wont
you

Get married’ He is alarmed now

We slept together last night — we made love — so that means
were getting married doesnt it

Well - yes — oh dear — we need to think hard about this you
know he says unhappily

Then suddenly he notices shes smiling

‘Oh youre joking’ he says Thank God For a moment I
thought I was in one ofthose awful films You know — the kind
where the woman spends a night with a man and murders him if
he wont marry her

No says Carrie gentlyWere not in one ofthose films But I
think weve both missed a great chance here Goodbye’

She leaves the room and Charles lies down in the bed He

looks thoughtful and confused

Chapter 2 The Second Wedding

You are invited to the wedding of Bernard and Lydia at noon on
August 1st at the Church of St Mary of the Fields

Cripplegate London EC2

It is three months later and Charless alarm clock is once again
ringing by his bed Charles stretches out his hand and turns it off He
goes back to sleep again He likes to sleep until noon whenever he
can Scarlett is still asleep in her untidy bedroom Some time later
there is a loud shout from Charless room He has woken up at last

Oh hell’

He jumps out ofbed and runs in to Scarlett dressed only in
his underclothes

Oh God says Scarlett when she looks at her clock

They run out of the house before they have finished putting
on their formal wedding clothes Scarlett is trying to put on a
silly pink dress with an enormous skirt but she cant zip it up
right She is going to be a bridesmaid

Car or taxi she asks still running

Taxi says CharlesWe wont be able to park the car

They get to the corner of the street and start looking for a
taxi But there isnt one anywhere

Well maybe the car is a better idea says Charles

They rush down another street to find Scarletts car But when
they get there it cant be moved Scarlett must have parked it in
the wrong place and the wheels have been locked by the police

Damn they both shout at once

They will have to go on footThey run as fast as they can

The service will start before we get there’ Charles thinks to

himself

Charles and Scarlett get to the corner of the street and start lookingfor a

taxi But there isnt one anywhere

The skirts of Scarletts silly pink dress fly up in the wind and
as she runs a piece ofthe dress falls off

Charles is going to stop and pick it up but Scarlett says Leave
it Nobody will notice’

They run all the way to the church and as they get near they
can hear the bells ringing loudly Some of their friends are
already there - Fiona Matthew Gareth and David

Sorry Im late’ says Charles The traffic was awful

They all look at him nobody believes him at all

Yes well — says Charles Now whos getting married today’

He reads the wedding card pretending that he doesnt know
¢

They all go into the church where the wedding is about to start
A young priest comes in looking worried and nervous Its
Father Gerald who they met at the last wedding reception Hes
finished his studying and now hes a real priest

Today Tom is best man He has remembered to bring the
rings one each for the bride and groom He takes them out of
his pocket and shows them to Charles holding them up to his
eyes like a pair of glasses Charles smiles and waves at him

As the wedding music starts the bride and her bridesmaids
enter the church The bride of course is Lydia who first kissed
her bridegroom Bernard at the last wedding reception There are
four bridesmaids Two are little girls and two are women One of
them is Scarlett As she walks up the aisle everyone can see her
bright blue underclothes The piece of her dress that fell off has
left a large hole in the back of her dress Scarlett is still wearing
her sunglasses too — she looks quite strange She takes them off
just as they reach the priest Bernard is standing there by the
priest waiting for his bride

Father Gerald begins to read the words of the marriage
service Unfortunately because he is very nervous he gets some
ofthe words wrong Everybody bursts out laughing

‘Its his first wedding you see Matthew whispers to Charles
Hes a friend ofthe family’

Ah Excellent says Charles He finds it very amusing

Father Gerald calls Bernard ‘Lydia’ by mistake And when he
does get the grooms name right he doesnt know how to say
Bernards middle name Its written StJohn and spoken as Sinjun
hurriedly Everyone is smiling This is all very entertaining

Now as the priest speaks the bride and groom have to repeat
the same words after him

‘IT Bernard Delaney — says Father Gerald leaving out the St

John part now Do take you Lydia Jane Hibbott to be my awful

wedded wife’ This is not what he should say at all He is so
nervous that hes getting the words mixed up

To be my lawful wedded wife’ Bernard says These are the
words Father Gerald should have said

‘Thats right Thats right’ says Father Gerald He doesnt know
exactly what hes doing now but somehow they get to the end of
the service

Well done shouts Gareth clapping and the others copy him
Its like being at the theatre and after the service everybody
congratulates the priest Gerald is very pleased with himself and

is smiling too now that its all over
e

The reception is being held in an elegant London hotel The
guests seem to be from rich upper-class families All the men are
wearing formal wedding coats and the women are in expensive
dresses Lydia the bride is in an excellent mood she is laughing
and kissing the guests as they arrive Charles Gareth and
Matthew have already found the drinks They are used to
weddings and know exactly what to do

Do you know what I think about marriage’ asks Gareth
Two people are in love They live together then suddenly they
cant think of anything to say to each other Theyre worried —
what are they going to do Then the man has an idea

What asks Charles

Theyll get married And then theyve got something to talk
about for the rest oftheir lives

So - people get married when they cant communicate
properly any more Is that what youre saying

Yes thats right Tom Tom the best man has come to join
them Hows the speech

Fine — good I think Something for everyone - yes the jokes

will raise a few smiles and there should be a few tears too’ Tom says

Excellent’ says Gareth

‘Its an interesting idea Gareth says Charles

Of course theres another idea Some people think that
weddings are about true love’ says Matthew looking at Gareth

Well thats a thought Charles replies lightly But he has
listened seriously Charles is very confused about love and
marriage at the moment

The reception is very busy now full ofwell-dressed guests who
are drinking and chatting laughing and calling to one another

Charles isjust fetching three more drinks when a voice says Hi

He turns round Its Carrie She looks wonderful

‘Hello’ says Charles and nearly drops the drinks

How are you asks Carrie

‘Fine Fine Sorry — Im so surprised and so pleased to see you
Dont go back to America Please Wait here — Ill be back in two
seconds OK

OK she smiles

He rushes back to the others

Thats yours And thats yours’ he says giving them their
drinks See you in five hours

Has something happened asks Gareth

Yes — yes — this is a great wedding you know’

But when he finds Carrie again things dont go quite as he
planned

Hi You look perfect In fact you probably are perfect How
are you

Im really well Charles Id like you to meet Hamish Hamish
and I are going to get married’

This is a horrible shock for Charles but he tries to hide it

Excellent excellent Im happy to meet you Hamish Lovely
surprise to find Carrie back in this country again

Hamish is an elegant and confident man of about fifty He is

Scottish

Yes well it wasnt easy I had to work hard — she didnt want
to come at first Come on Carrie dear I want you to meetJames
Hes waiting for us over there Hell think that I cant control you
at all ifwe dont go and find him now He holds out his hand to
Carrie and she takes it

Tll see you later’ she says in a friendly way to Charles as she
walks away with Hamish

Charles is shocked and very unhappy He is unhappy about
Carrie of course but why is he so very unhappy He doesnt
quite understand himself at the moment He doesnt feel in the
mood tojoin in with the party any more and he sits down alone
Later Matthew comes up to talk to him

How are you doing Charles’ Matthew asks

Actually not great says Charles Not great at all really I dont
know — whats happening here Why am I always at weddings but
never getting married What does it mean

Youre not smart enough’ says Matthew Or perhaps it could
be because you havent met the right girl

Ah but is that right’ Charles asks Maybe I have met the
right girl Maybe I meet the right girls all the time Maybe its me
- Im the problem

Oh rubbish’ says Matthew

o

And then its time for dinner Everyone has been told to look at a
written table plan to find out where they have to sit It has all
been organized very carefully

Come on says Matthew youll probably meet your future
wife at dinner’

Charles looks at the table plan Oh my God he says but

doesnt tell Matthew why he is so alarmed

Fiona is already sitting at another table next to an upper-class
older woman who is wearing a bright blue dress and a bright
blue hat Her name is Mrs Beaumont

Are you married’ she asks Fiona immediately

No Fiona answers

‘Do you prefer women asks Mrs Beaumont

Good God says FionaWhat made you say that’

‘Well its a possibility these days isnt it’ Mrs Beaumont says
‘And its an interesting one Its very boring ifyou just say Oh
dear Ive never found the right man

Fiona laughs Quite rightWhy be boring

Thank you says Mrs Beaumont

Well Fiona continues I have met the right person you see
But hes not in love with me Until I stop loving him I cant get
interested in other men

Bad luck’ says her new friend

Yes isnt it’ says Fiona I did go with another girl once at
school — but it was only for about fifteen minutes I dont think

that really means anything do you
¢

Charles has now found his table and sits down with two men
and four young women who are all attractive and about the same
age as him His brother David is there too Charles looks very
embarrassed and uncomfortable

Hi says Charles to one ofthe men

Hello Im Alistair You knowVeronica dont you

Yes says Charles very nervous now ‘Yes — hello Vee Hi
Nicki Great to see you He can see Carrie on another table
Shes laughing with Matthew and Gareth Charles would much
rather be at their table

Alistair seems to be giving them all a lesson on tea There are

about four hundred different kinds of tea and all the fruit teas as

well I tookVeronica out to India at Christmas to see the places
where they grow it

‘Excellent’ says Charles

You andVeronica went to India together didnt you Charles
Alistair asks

‘Thats right’ Charles answers So Veronica was once a
girlfriend of Charless

‘Charles was horrible’ says Veronica I was really ill and hejust
joked all the time

I was only trying to make you feel betterVee

Oh youre thatVeronica says Nicki

Which Veronica’ Veronica asks Charlie — what have you
been saying’ Shes worried too now

But Charles doesnt want to answer the question Remember
Bombay he asks brightly

Nicki continuesWhen Charles and I were going out together’
- so shes another old girlfriend of his — he told me about this
interesting journey hed taken round India with Vomiting
Veronica Yes I think thats right Im sure thats what he called her

Did I really say that asks Charles quickly No I dont think
so -

Oh come on Charles says Martha who is old girlfriend
number three at the table You could never keep a secret Youre
hopeless’

Charles is certainly in a horrible mess now

Martha thats not quite true —

‘Im sure it is Charles says Nicki

ITremember another thing you told me Martha continues
‘About a girlfriend that you had called Helena Her mother liked
you too She wanted to go to bed with you You told me that you
didnt know what to do Would it be rude to refuse her you
asked yourself

‘Thats right’ adds Nicki You said that they were both as fat

as pigs Mrs Piggy and Miss Piggy —

IT think perhaps — says Charles but the three girls are laughing
loudly and theyre not listening to him

Finally the fourth girl who is sitting quietly next to him
speaks Weve both lost weight since then my mother and I she
says taking another chocolate

It is a disaster for Charles But fortunately its now time for the
speeches

Ah - great — speeches he says At least they cant talk about
him any more until later

Everyone claps Tom as he stands up

Yes — when Bernard told me he was getting married to Lydia
I congratulated him All his other girlfriends were real dogs you
see And of course Im delighted to see so many of them here
this evening

It is a terrible speech but Tom thinks he is doing well So does
Gareth He seems to enjoy really awful things

Camilla is one ofthem — its lovely to see you again Camilla
She was the first person who Bernard wanted to marry She told
him to go to hell Its lucky for Lydia that she did’

When the dinner and the formal parts of the reception are
over Charles and his friends are free to meet up again They find
some comfortable sofas and sit down together to chat

Gareth is talking about the wedding dinner For once he is not
being rude We had a lovely girl at our table — Carrie Shes going
to marry a man called Hamish Hes very rich and owns half of
Scotland So how are you he asks Charles

This is the wedding from hell’ Charles answers Old
girlfriends everywhere Ill probably meet Henrietta next Thatll
really finish the day offfor me

Hello Charles’ a voice says from behind him Its Henrietta
and of course shes also one of Charless old girlfriends Charles

seems to have no luck at all today Henrietta is a tall dark girl and

she is usually quite attractive But now her face is white and she
looks very unhappy Charles is feeling bad but Henrietta seems
to feel even worse

Hello Hen how are you says Charles brightly trying to
pretend that everything is all right He hopes that she did not
hear his last few words

She is silent for a moment then she bursts into tears

Oh Hen says Charles sympathetically

Helena jumps up from the sofa in a temper Why cant you
just leave her alone Havent you hurt her enough

She leads Henrietta away

Charles gets up Excuse me he says to Gareth I think I ama
walking disaster at the moment I think Id better go away and be

alone

¢

But not everyone is having a bad time David Charless brother is
talking to Serena the pretty girl who was interested in him at the
last wedding reception She has been hoping to meet him again
and has started to learn sign language so that she can
communicate with him

She signs her name Im S-e-r-e-n-a

David smiles sweetly at her

‘Hello’ he signs back

‘Im just learning’ says Serena with her hands Im probably
making lots of mistakes’ She certainly is — she signs tols instead
of lots and nistakes instead of mistakes But David doesnt want
to correct her He shakes his head and smiles again

No perfect Perfect’ he tells her’ Would you like to dance’

Yes that would be nice’ Serena replies They go off together

looking very happy
Charles is in a bedroom upstairs It seems to be empty — the door
was open but there was nobody insidejust a suit hanging up on a
cupboard door Its dark now but he doesnt turn the light on
He goes to the window and looks down on to the street below He
just stands there quietly glad to be alone in a calm room But after
a minute or two he sees Carrie down there Shes coming out of
the hotel with Hamish They have their arms around each other
and look very happy They get into a taxi together Charles watches
them unhappily as they drive off He seems to be very depressed

Then the door opens and Bernard and Lydia come in kissing
noisily They are so interested in each other that they dont notice
Charles They are still dressed for the wedding — Lydia in her
brides dress and Bernard in his suit This is their room the place
where they are going to change into their other clothes before
they go away on their honeymoon

But theyre not ready to change yet They are about to have
sex on the bed Charles wonders how he can escape and he
begins to try to walk from the window to the door very very
quietly

Then suddenly Lydia cries Wait a minute This isnt good
enough I want to see my lovely husband’

She turns on the light She is lying on top ofBernard — she still
has her dress on but Charles knows whats happening underneath
it Luckily they dont see Charles But he cant get past them to
the door Then he sees another door nearer to him so he opens it
and goes through it as fast as he can Oh no Its only a kind of
very small washroom — no more than a cupboard really Theres
almost no room in it for Charles He waits there its very

uncomfortable and it seems to him that he has to wait for hours
e

Downstairs the other guests are enjoying themselves Several of

them are dancing to the lively music Scarlett is sitting in a

strange place like Charles upstairs Shes under a table with one
ofthe small bridesmaids They are both dancing to the music but
only using their hands for the dancing movements

Have you got a boyfriend’ Scarlett asks the little girl whose
name is Freda

Yes says Freda

Whats his name

‘Dolph Hes good at table-tennis And you

No No boyfriend

Why not

I dont know says Scarlett a little unhappily When I like
men they dont seem to like meThey think Im stupid Then the
ones who like me — well I think theyre stupid I dont want to go
out with them So that doesnt get me anywhere does it

¢
Upstairs in the bedroom time passes Lydia and Bernard are still
making love very noisily Charles is sitting on the basin in the
washroom He looks at his watch

God are they going to finish soon he wonders If hed
known they were going to take so long he wouldnt have hidden
there

‘Oh - I love my wife’ cries Bernard

I-love-my-husband screams Lydia

They finish After a quiet moment or two Bernard says Wed
better go downstairs now I suppose’

Charles nods Yes Yes he says silently to himself

Or says Lydia we could wait a few minutes — and start
again’

No no Charles shakes his head inside the cupboard

He really cant stay there any longer so he opens the door He
walks past Lydia and Bernard who are still lying on the bed They

are amazed and stare at him in great surprise but he pretends that

its not strange at all He holds up a pencil as he walks towards the
door ofthe room

I found it he says and goes out

o

But his troubles are not over Henrietta is outside

Charles we must talk’ she says firmly

Right right he says pleasantly Is this a bad dream But he
would rather talk to Henrietta than stay in the bedroom with
Bernard and Lydia

They start walking downstairs together

The thing is Charlie Ive spoken to lots ofpeople about you

Oh God says Charles

And everyone agrees that youre in real trouble Charles’ she
continues seriously

Am I he asks

You see you have one girlfriend after another but you dont
love any ofthemYou never let a woman get close to you at all’

No no Hen its not like that — says Charles

But its no good Henrietta continues Youre nice to them
sweet to them — you were sweet to me though you thought I
was stupid’

I didnt’

Yes you did You dont give people a chance Whenever you
have a new girlfriend you think I mustnt fall in love I mustnt
get married

Hen you know me I dont think like that Most ofthe time
- well I dont think at all

Oh Charlie’ Henrietta suddenly throws her arms around
him The way you used to look at me I thought - I thought that
you were going to ask me to marry you But you were only
thinking about how to leave me Oh - this is awful’

She walks away She is very upset Charles just stands there He

cant move Actually he doesnt know what to do Then he turns
round and sees Carrie behind him

‘Are you having a good time she asks him

‘Oh yes of course Wonderful — better than my fathers
funeral Really entertaining’ Charles saysI thought youd gone

No - Hamish is going on the night train to Edinburgh I just
went with him to the station But I am leaving now Do you want
to come with me

So Charles and Carrie drive off together through the late-
night streets of London The taxi takes them to Carries flat

Are you coming up for a drink she asks Charles

Are you sure’ he asks He looks rather doubtful about the

situation
Yes - I think we can take a chance she jokes ‘Youre
attractive — but I can still refuse you no problem Youre not so

attractive you know’

Charles is not feeling very confident after all the horrible
things that have happened today so he doesnt share the joke
OKYes Great he says without a smile

But as soon as they are together in Carries flat its like the last
time that they met They kiss and become lovers again They are
both very happy to be with each other and they spend the night
together But Carrie is still going to marry Hamish Charles has
left it all too late

In the early morning Charles gets up first He puts on his
formal wedding suit again he doesnt have any other clothes with
him He looks at Carrie for a long moment and she looks back
at him She is very beautiful They seem to be in love and Charles
doesnt want to go Finally he turns and leaves the room quietly
What would have happened to the couple if Charles hadnt been

so confused

Chapter 3 A Free Saturday

It is nearly noon on Saturday September the ist Charles is in
bed asleep as usual The door opens and Scarlett comes in
carrying cups and plates and the morning letters

Good morning Charles Ive brought us some breakfast Sorry
the toasts a bit burnt’

She sits down on the edge of the bed Charles wakes up
Scarlett pours the tea and spreads butter on the toast They eat
breakfast together comfortably

What are you going to do today she asks him

Well says Charles today is a day without a wedding A free
Saturday The only thing that I have to do is to meet David I

mustnt be late for him He picks up a large white envelope and
opens it

T think Ill look for a job today’ says Scarlett I heard about
one the other day as a shop assistant You have to sell strange
clothes to strange people I think Id be good at it

But Charles isnt concentrating He is studying the card in the
envelope He looks rather upset

Are you all right’ Scarlett asks him

Its that girl Carrie - do you remember The American girl

Its the invitation to her wedding
¢

The invitation also tells guests the address ofthe shop where they
can buy presents for the bride and groom This is another custom
for some people in England It seems that Charles is still going to

spend his time today on weddings

In Britain most weddings happen on a Saturday

But Charles isnt concentrating He is studying the card in the envelope

Tts that girl Carrie — do you remember The American girl Its the

invitation to her wedding

The shop is horribly expensive There are handmade carpets
there is furniture from different parts ofthe world and the place
is full of all kinds ofunusual and beautiful things

The shop assistant is also very elegant She looks down her
nose at Charles who is wearing an old shirt with his shorts and
running shoes He doesnt look at all smart

Excuse me he asks her Do you have the wedding list for
Banks Hamish and Carrie Banks Carrie Banks is what Carrie
will be called after her marriage to Hamish

The assistant looks at Charles with dislike Certainly sir I can
show you plenty ofpresents for about one thousand pounds

Ah says Charles who is amazed but is trying not to show it
What about presents for fifty pounds

You can buy this one says the assistant She points to a life-

size wooden African man

This says Charles Excellent

You can buy it’ the assistant says nastilyifyou can find someone
to pay the other three thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds

Charles smiles He is still being very polite and trying to look
calm

‘Or we sell plastic bags for one pound fifty pence each she
continues Why dont youjust buy thirty-three ofthem

Actually I think Ill probably leave it Thanks very much
Youve been very He was going to say ‘helpful’ but it
wouldnt be true

As he turns round to go out ofthe shop Carrie walks in

What did you get she asks him smiling She looks very happy

‘Oh — nothing nothing yet Ive just been looking’ says
Charles It is once again a surprise to meet her He is always
delighted to see her but he never knows what to say

‘Its nice to see you she says

‘Its nice to see you’ says Charles

‘Its great getting presents’ says Carrie She laughs Why didnt
I get married years ago Has anybody bought the wooden
African yet she asks the assistant

‘The young man is thinking about it’ says the assistant icily
polite

Charles nods thoughtfully trying to look as ifthis is a serious
idea

Oh no’ says Carrie who is quick to understand Get me
something small — a teapot or something Are you free for about
halfan hour

Yes — I have to meet my brother but — I can be a little bit late’
Its a lie David will be annoyed if Charles is late But he doesnt
want to miss the chance to spend some time with Carrie

Good she says Come with me Ive got to make an

important decision

She takes Charles offto the dress shop where she plans to choose
her wedding dress

‘The most important thing she saysis — please dont laugh

OK Right says Charles seriously

The assistant brings dress after dress Carrie takes each one
away and tries it on Each time when shes ready she comes out
and shows Charles The first dress is very complicated with full
skirts

What do you think she asks him

‘Lovely’ says Charles

‘Isnt it a bit like a cake she asks him

Well — says Charles

‘Dont worry’ says Carrie I thought so too But weve only
just begun

She comes out next in a very modern style of dress Actually
it is not really a dress at all — its a suit with trousers a long open
coat and a very small top Sexy

What do you think this time asks Carrie

Youre joking’ says Charles

‘But its wonderful isnt it Maybe next time

The next dress is long in a country girl’ style like an old
eighteenth-century picture It is quite sweet but not right for
Carrie

What do you think she asks again

Ah — says Charles

I knew it’ she says smiling and goes behind the curtain to
take it off

Then she comes out in a very simple but very sexy dress

‘Its a bit sexy she says

‘If I was your husband Id be so proud says Charles and he
means it But maybe youre rightYou dont want the priest to
get too excited

After Carrie has chosen her dress they go to a cafe together

to drink tea It has started to rain now

Marriage is strange’ says Charles ‘Just one man and one
woman — no more lovers ever Do you think youll stay faithful’

Yes once Im married’ Carrie replies I told Hamish that I
would kill him if he goes with another woman So Id better do
the same I think and leave other men alone’

Quite right’ says Charles

‘And Ive had plenty oflovers in my life’ she continues

Have you asks Charles surprisedHow many is plenty

Well — oh I dont know says Carrie a little bit embarrassed
More than one

‘Tell me says Charles There are no secrets between us now
Ive seen the wedding dress remember’

Well — says Carrie and she starts to count on her fingers The
first one of course you never forget It was nice Number two -
he had too much hair on his back Three — four - five - number
six was on my birthday in my parents’ bedroom’

Which birthday asks Charles quickly

My seventeenth’ she answers

Seventeen You got to number six by your seventeenth
birthday’

I grew up in the country — its different there’ she saysOK —
seven was good Eight - rather small That was a shock Nine -
we were standing up against a gate Never try it Charles Its very
uncomfortable

I wont he promises her seriously

Ten was wonderful really like heaven

I hate him says Charles

Eleven — no good Numbers twelve to seventeen were during
my university years They were all nice intelligent boys — but the
sex wasnt much good Eighteen broke my heart I couldnt forget
him for years afterwards’

Im sorry’ Charles says

I dont remember number nineteen But my girlfriend says
that it did happen — twice She shared my room so she should
know Twenty — are we really at twenty God Twenty-one —
horrible I dont want to talk about him Twenty-two - well he
was always falling asleep That was my first year in England

I must apologize for England and Englishmen says Charles

Twenty-three and twenty-four were together — I wont forget
that

Seriously asks Charles but she wont answer him He is not
sure how much ofthis is serious at all

Twenty-five was a lovely Frenchman Twenty-six was an awful
Frenchman Twenty-seven was a mistake’

Suddenly at number twenty-seven you made a mistake’ asks
Charles Can this really be true’

He kept on screaming’ says Carrie simply I nearly gave up
sex after that But Spencer changed my mind for me He was
number twenty-eight Then there was his father number twenty-
nine’

Spencers father’ Charles repeats

Then thirty — horrible Thirty-one — oh my God Thirty-two
- she pauses Thirty-two was lovely And then theres Hamish
number thirty-three’

So I was - after Hamish asks Charles He really wants to
know now

No you were thirty-two replies Carrie and Charles thinks
about this

Thats it then’ says Carrie Less than Madonna more than
Princess Diana — I hope What about you How many people
have you slept with

Not as many as you Charles answers I probably dont have
enough timeWhat do I do with my time Actually I dont really
know I work - yes thats it Work work and more work Im

always working late’

Carrie and Charles both stop talking There is a very serious silent

moment something has happened and they both feel it

Carrie laughs And suddenly they both stop talking There is a
very serious silent moment something has happened and they
both feel it

I wish Id phoned you says Charles But you didnt ring me
Then he looks at his watch Oh hell Help me please Im late —

again

When they reach the cinema David is still waiting outside Ifit
hadnt been his brother he would have probably have left by now
Charles is very very late David signs to him Youre not my
brother any more Yourejust some stupid fool that I once met

Carrie this is David my brother says CharlesThis is Carrie’

he signs

Hi says Carrie

We were buying a wedding dress for her Charles signs

Thats a really poor excuse’ David replies Whos she
marrying’

They can now have a secret conversation because Carrie
doesnt understand sign language

A real fool’ says Charles

How does a fool find a beautiful wife like her asks David

Carrie is waiting for a translation

Yes Im just telling David that youre marrying Hamish
What a lucky man he said to me

Didnt you make love to her once asks David Fortunately
Carrie still cant understand

He wants to know where you are getting married’ Charles
pretends to translate

In Scotland Carrie answers

Shes got lovely breasts’ says David and uses his hands to
describe them

Oh lovely hills up there in Scotland he says Charles
translates quickly

Why dont you come to the wedding Carrie asks David Id
like some nice friends to come — Hamish is going to invite some
awful people Well youd better go in and see the film Goodbye’

The brothers watch her as she walks away Charles and David
go into the cinema but suddenly Charles changes his mind

Oh hell he says

He runs out of the cinema and chases Carrie up the steps
David is left alone at the entrance to the cinema Charles catches
up with Carrie by the river

Carrie - Sorry sorry Oh — this is stupid — youve just
bought your wedding dress But I wondered if there was any
chance — no obviously not Ive only slept with nine women - so

why am I asking silly questions But I just wondered — I really

feel — well let me say it more clearly like the man in the song Or
was it the man on television I think I love you Would you
perhaps like to — no no of course not Im a fool and he isnt
Excellent Excellent Lovely to see you Must go now

He turns to leave then adds Damn

That was very sweet’ says Carrie She is smiling at him and
looks very affectionate

‘Well I thought about it a lot you know I wanted to get itjust
right Its important that Ive said it

What have you said exactly’ asks Carrie

I said that I think — oh you know what I said Charles is
finding this very difficult

Youre lovely’ says Carrie and kisses him For a minute they
stand close together then Carrie walks away She looks back at

him one last time

Chapter 4 The Third Wedding

You are invited to the wedding of Hamish and Carrie
on September 28th in the church at Glenthrist Castle
Perthshire Scotland

It is already a cold wet autumn in Scotland by the time of Hamish
and Carries weddingThe mountains and lakes look very beautiful
but also very gloomy and grey Charles arrives late — as usual - and
tries to change quickly out ofthe warm heavy clothes that he put
on for the journey He takes off his pullover and puts on his
wedding coat before he steps out ofthe car The wedding is in the
little church that belongs to Hamishs castle

The door of the church makes a loud noise as Charles opens
it ‘Sorry sorry’ he whispers Everybody turns round to see whos
there

The little church looks charming The service has begun and
Carrie is standing with Hamish and the priest at the front She
looks lovely too - serious but beautiful The priest asks Hamish
whether he will take Carrie for his wife

I do says Hamish

He asks Carrie whether she is willing to take Hamish for her
husband

I do’ answers Carrie

‘Damn damn damn it to hell whispers Charles as violently as

he dares His last hope has disappeared
°

The reception is in the fine castle that Hamish owns As the
guests walk there from the church they can hear special Scottish

music being played When they arrive they are welcomed by

servants who are wearing formal Scottish uniforms Among the
guests many of the men are wearing Scottish-style clothes too
and some ofthe ladies are also dressed in the Scottish style The
bride the groom and the family are standing in a line The guests
shake hands with them as they come in Carrie is standing at the
end ofthe line next to Hamish Charles congratulates Carrie

You look beautiful’ he says as he shakes her hand

There is some lively Scottish dancing in the middle of the
room

‘Oh great’ says Gareth Its like one of those films Its so
Scottish that it cant possibly be true’

He joins in the dancing enthusiastically

Dear friends’ he says a little later when his usual group of
friends is standing together at the edge ofthe room None ofus
is marriedYou know I was always proud ofthat Not a wedding
ring between us But now Im getting older and its suddenly
begun to make me sad Id like to go to the wedding of someone
who I really love

‘Well dont blame me says Tom Ive asked everybody that I
know to marry me

You havent asked me says Scarlett a little sadly

Havent I asks Tom in surprise

No she shakes her head

Well Scarlett — would you like to marry me

No thank you Tom It was very nice ofyou to ask me

Well any time you like says Tom kindly

Good man Tom shouts Gareth Now why dont the rest of
you do the same Go and find husbands and wives for yourselves
Those are your orders for tonight But first well all drink to
True Love

What about you Fi Tom asks his sister Can you see a
husband here

Oh get lost Tom replies Fiona

‘True love They all raise their glasses

Tom takes the idea seriously He tries to talk to a pretty
woman A lot of people actually meet their husbands and wives
at weddings Did you know that’

Yes I met my husband at a wedding she answers him

‘Oh Oh well says Tom and drinks the rest of his wine very
quickly Look at that My glass is empty Excuse me —

Scarlett seems to be having better luck The person she is
talking to is probably the best-looking man at the wedding And
hes not wearing Scottish clothes — hes American

‘Hello my names Scarlett Like Scarlett OHara in Gone with the
Wind but Im much less trouble than she was Whats your name’

My names Rhett’ says the American

‘No — from the same story Not really’

No not really he smilesMy names Chester

Youre a joker Scarlett laughs When I meet Americans I
always think that theyre going to be boring But ofcourse youre
not boring are youYoure lovely’

Scarlett has to look up a long way when she talks to Chester
He is very tall and she is short It looks quite funny

Charles is hiding from Henrietta but she soon finds him

‘Oh hi Hen Sorry — I didnt come to talk to you because I
really dont want an argument today Im sure that weve got lots
to talk about but not today Hen not today

‘Did I behave badly last time Henrietta asks

‘It was quite frightening’ says Charles ‘Like a murder film

Henrietta laughs - she is in a good mood Charles decides that
hes safe with her today and so he goes on talking to her

‘Oh Hen Im depressed says CharlesWhat about you How

are you

A famous film and novel Scarlett and Rhett are the names ofthe two most

important people in it

‘Well Im quite happy actually’ she says Ive got a new
boyfriend and my weights down to almost nothing’

‘Perhaps you were right Hen says Charles ‘Perhaps we should
have got married

God no says Henrietta I dont want to marry your friends
too specially Fiona

‘Fiona loves you says Charles

‘Fiona calls me Duck-Face says Henrietta
‘Ive never heard that says Charles
Henrietta knows that hes lying Come to lunch sometime’ she
says Give me a ring’ She gives him a gentle kiss on the cheek
As she walks away Fiona comes up to Charles Hows Duck-

Face she asks

‘Shes fine actually’ says CharlesNot too mad at the moment’

e

‘Ladies and gentleman says the best man The bride and groom’

Hamish and Carrie dance together in the middle ofthe room
Its a formal Scottish dance and everybody claps them Charles
and Fiona watch the happy couple with the other guests Fiona
puts her hand on Charless shoulder and looks at him She can see
that he looks sad

‘You like this girl dont you Charles asks Fiona

‘Yes — its a strange thing this love business when at last it
happens and now shes marrying another man answers
Charles But what about you Fifi Have you met your future
husband here’

No — and I wont — its not like that Ive been in love with the
same man for years

Have you Charles asks in surprise Whos that

You Charlie’ says Fiona very lightly Charles stops smiling
He looks shocked Fiona walks away and goes into a quieter

room Charles follows her

It was always you ever since we first met’ says Fiona I knew
that from the first moment I saw you Across a crowded room —
you know what they say But it doesnt matter We cant do
anything about it Thats life And were friends — friends isnt
bad you know Its quite good really

Charles is upset and he feels her pain A few months ago he
didnt know love but now he knows how it feels He is deeply
sorry for her and takes her hand

‘Oh Fi Its not easy is it

No But forget it — it cant happen between us Charlie

Just then Matthew comes in Fiona pretends that nothing has
happened

Matthew dear she says brightly Wheres Gareth’

‘Hes being rude to Americans’ Matthew answers

‘How thoughtful of him

Gareth is dancing with an American woman She looks

surprised as he turns her round fast and jumps about quite

Gareth is dancing with an American woman

violently Tom is dancing too and looking hopefully at every girl
in the room He clearly hasnt found his future wife yet

When its time for the speeches Gareth comes back over to his
friends very hot

‘Ladies and gentlemen fill your glasses please’ says the best
man Unusually the bride will make the first speech

‘Excellent’ says GarethI love this girl

He looks at Charles — he knows about Charless feelings for
Carrie now

‘Thank you’ says Carrie as everybody claps her And thank
you to those people whove flown in from the United States
Congratulations to the rest of you You came here even
though you knew that all these terrible Americans were
coming too

People laugh and Charles looks at Carrie with love

My dear Dad should be the one to give this speech But sadly
hes not alive today If he was here I know what he would say
Lovely dress girl But why the hell are you marrying a man ina
skirt

They laugh again though Hamish is not very pleased with this
joke about Scottish clothes

My answer is’ Carrie continues Because I love him As
John Lennon said Love is the answerAnd we all know that

The guests clap loudly Charles cant believe that he has been
so stupid Why did he let her go If he hadnt been so slow he
would have been the groom here today

‘Oh one more thing’ says Carrie Someone here said that if
things didnt go well with Hamish he would be ready to take his
place Well thank you and Ill let you know’

It is a very cheeky thing to say but Hamish laughs loudly He
begins to make his speech now very confidently Hamish is not
self-conscious He has had years of practice in public speaking

Suddenly there is a loud noise a kind ofcrash at the back

Oh dear — someone doesnt agree with me he jokes No
problem Im used to that

But the crash was Gareth falling unconscious to the floor
Charles David and Tom get to him quickly

Find a doctor’ says Charles urgently While Hamish is still
speaking a doctor is found among the wedding guests He gives
Gareth a quick examination Then they carry him into a quieter
room and put him down gently on the ground Charles is on his
knees holding Gareths head But its too late Gareth is dead
Then he decides that he must find Matthew quickly among the
crowd of guests

Charles sees Matthew and walks towards him Just before he
reaches him he stops — its a hard moment Then he moves
forward takes Matthews arm and whispers to him As he tells
him about Gareth they can hear the guests behind them begin to

sing

Chapter 5 A Funeral

It is the day of Gareths funeral It takes place in the town where
Gareths parents live a small and dirty town full of factories
Gareth didnt come from a rich family It is raining and grey and
everyone looks very sad It is a big contrast to the three
wonderful weddings Matthew and Gareths family are driven to
the church in a large black car In front of them is the car with
Gareths coffin

Charles arrives at the church and sits down next to Fiona
putting his arm around her Carrie is there too quiet and white-
faced at the back The atmosphere is very different from the
atmosphere at the weddings Everybody is wearing dark clothes
and nobody is talking

Good morning the priest welcomes everybody Welcome to
you all on this cold day Our service will begin in a few minutes
but first weve asked Gareths closest friend Matthew to say a few
words’

Matthew steps forward and stands near the coffin It has
beautiful flowers on it

Gareth preferred funerals to weddings One day I shall
probably have a funeral he said but a wedding — never

People smile and begin to feel a little bit more comfortable

I rang a few people and asked them about Gareth What did
they think about him What comes into their minds when they
hear his name Well a lot of people said Fat And a lot more
said Terribly rude So very fat and very rude was the way that
strangers described Gareth But then some of you here rang me
and said that you loved him You remember visiting Gareth and
how kind he was to his guests You remember what an

adventurous cook he was Fortunately the secrets of some of his

Matthew steps forward and stands near the coffin

dishes like duck with banana are lost for ever Gareth really
loved life I hope you will remember him specially for that

‘How do I remember him I cant find the words — Im sorry
So Ive taken the words of that wonderful writer W H Auden
This is what I really want to say

He reads from a book

He was my North my South my East and West
My working week and my Sunday rest
My noon my midnight my talk my song

I thought that love would last for ever I was wrong

After the service people meet and talk outside It was a very

emotional funeral and everybody looks very sad The car with

Gareths coffin is driven away

Charles finds Carrie ‘Its good ofyou to come he says ‘But
didnt it spoil your honeymoon’

Oh it doesnt matter’ says Carrie Well do it another time
You know that thing you said in the street

Yes Im sorry about that’ Charles says quickly

No dont be sorry I liked it Im glad that you said it’ She
kisses him gently on the cheek then walks away He watches her
go-

Would you like a walk Charlie asks Tom

Yes — good idea

Ive never felt like that’ says Tom Not like Matthew Not that
kind ofloveWell I felt something forJilly when I was young -

‘Jilly asks Charles surprised

Our family dogTom explains

Yes says Charles Its strange isnt it weve all been friends
for years and we never noticed that Matthew and Gareth were
really married in their own way

They have reached the river but it is not an attractive place —
there are factories all along the banks Everything looks cold and
gloomy Charles is holding an umbrella as it is still raining

‘Its hardest for his parents’ says Tom I hope I die before my
children

Youre very confident that youll get married says Charles
But should we get married at all if we cant find the right
person We saw today at the service that there can be a perfect
marriage And if we cant be like Gareth and Matthew perhaps
we should just forget the idea Some ofus wont get married at
all

I dont know Charlie’ says Tom thoughtfully I dont hope for
the perfect marriage Im not looking for thunder and lightning I
just want a nice friendly girl who likes me too Then well get

married and be happy It worked for my parents — well it did for

years until they separated

Then I give you six months at the mostTom replies Charles
You wont have to wait any longer than that Itll happen before
then youll see And maybe youre right Maybe waiting for true

love is quite useless

Chapter 6 The Fourth Wedding

You are invited to the wedding of Charles and — onJuly 15th
at St Julians Church Smithfield London EC1

Its Charless wedding day but even now hes not awake His male
friends gave him a special party last night and everybody drank
too much The alarm clock rings Charles turns it off He gets
ready to go back to sleep again But then another bell rings and
another

What the hells happening’ he asks He looks around the
roomThere are twenty or thirty alarm clocks in there with him

Tom has been sleeping next to himI decided that we mustnt
be late’ he says brightly I like your hair-style — excellent for a
wedding Charless hair is a total mess He gets out of bed and
goes into the kitchen still in his underwear Matthew is already
there hes going to be Charless best man Unlike Charles he
looks very smart

Matthew - great says Charles sleepily ‘Listen - thanks for
doing this today I wish Gareth was here He knows what a hard
time Matthew has had recently

Hed like to be here too says Matthew Sorry were so late
The others are just parking the car We thought that we could all
go in Toms car because its so big

Late Is it so late’ asks Charles

Yes - its 945

Nine forty-five’ Charles cant believe it

‘Only forty-five minutes until you say I do

Oh God I wanted the alarm to ring at eight oclock I told
Tom Oh hell

Now Scarlett comes in still in her nightdress Her hair looks

terrible too and she is yawning

Scarlett Matthew says Are you ready

Oh yes yes — she answers sleepily Just give me twenty
seconds And she makes herselfa cup of coffee

They drive as fast as they can to the church Charles is still
putting on his tie when he gets out ofthe car

‘Whats the time he asks urgently

Honestly asks Matthew You really want to know

Yes — tell me please

Well says Matthew ‘its about ten to nine

Charles keeps on running towards the church then suddenly
he realizes what Matthew said

You rats he shouts His friends all start laughing they
changed the time on all those clocks If they hadnt played this

joke Charles would have been late for his own wedding
o

Theyve got plenty of time now so they get some coffee and
drink it outside on the grass Fiona decides to make a speech

‘Ill just say a little word she begins Ive watched Charless
girlfriends come and go for years now I was worried that he
would never get married But now everythings going to be fine
Unfortunately his bride is quite crazy - but perhaps thats why he
loves her So lets drink to Charles and his beautiful girl on this
sad day Be happy — and dont forget us

Thank you says Charles

To Charles — and Duck-Face

They raise their plastic coffee cups and drink

Thank you Fiona for those few kind words about my future
wife Charles replies Shes sent a message for you too He pulls
out a piece of paper and reads - or pretends to read — from it
If any of you come near my house Ill send the dogs out to

yom

get you

Charles pulls out a piece of paper and reads — or pretends to read — from

it Ifany of you come near my house Ill send the dogs out to get you

Everyone laughs and they set off for the church Today

perhaps for the first time ever Charles wont be late
¢

John is one ofthe first guests to arrive Hes the man whose wife
was still seeing Toby de Lisle And hes actually Henriettas
brother

Hope my sister arrives’ he says to Charles You cant have a
wedding without a bride you know And why didnt you have a
party last night

Oh but we did we did — we didnt think it was a good idea’
says Charles hurriedly John of course was not invited to the
party

You look lovely today Fi’ Charles says to Fiona as they enter

the church together Shes wearing a smart jacket ofred blue and
other colours

Yes she replies I decided that I wouldnt wear black any
more Usually Fiona chooses black or dark colours for her
clothes From now on Im going to wear bright colours and
find somebody wholl fall in love with me Thatll be different
wont it’

‘Youre a dear girl’ says Charles and gives her a friendly kiss

Charles stays alone in the church He walks around and looks
rather uncomfortable and nervous He doesnt look as happy as
bridegrooms usually look on their wedding day

Outside the church Scarlett and Matthew are welcoming the
guests As usual Scarlett is wearing something strange — this time
its a formal wedding suit but made in a mans style It looks quite
sweet on her but a little bit odd Suddenly she screams Chester
has come — her tall charming American from Carrie and
Hamishs wedding She is delighted

I thought that youd gone back to America she says
excitedly

Without you he asks NeverAnd he gives her a big kiss

An old man appears at the door Its the crazy man who sat
next to Charles at the first wedding

Bride or groom Matthew asks him so that he can show him
where to sit

The old man looks at him angrily Im neither’ he says Cant
you see

Tom is looking after a young lady called Deirdre

Bride or groom he asks her

Bride she says She looks like a nice girl — very gentle and
pretty But for Tom its something more Its love at first sight

‘Havent we met before he asks her

Yes we have about twenty-five years ago Were cousins —

well distant cousins’ she smiles at him Youre Tom arent you

So youre family Wonderful — well do sit here Deirdre he says

Good God he tells himself as he walks away Thunder and
lightning’

Charles is even more nervous now as he sees all the guests
coming in

Good luck says the priest passing by

Lydia and Bernard arrive together and Charles goes over to
welcome them

How are you he asks

Very tired actually’ says Bernard

Then Charles suddenly sees Carrie who has come alone He
didnt have any idea that she was coming Shes looking elegant
but she seems to be in a quiet mood and a little sad

Hi he saysYou look lovely But then you always look nice at
weddings’

She smiles at him

Hows Hamish’ he asks

Oh hes fine — I think she says

You think’ asks Charles surprisedWhat do you mean

He wasnt the right man for me after all’ she says

Youve left him

We left each other she tells him She looks quite weak and
Charles leads her to a quiet place at the side ofthe church where
they can talk

When did this happen he asks her

Oh a few months ago March was hell But by April wed
made all the decisions and it was OK I wont marry someone so
old again She tries to turn it into ajoke but obviously she is not
very happy

Charlie calls Matthew Time to go

Yes yes — Im coming says Charles not really listening to
him But why didnt you ring me up

‘Well I thought about it’ Carrie replies-and I wanted to — but

things were so difficult then Youd better go now Ill see you later’
‘Ill show you to your seat’ Charles saysWe just didnt get it
right did we Ifonly wed been together at the right time
Yes we got it wrong’ Carrie says sadly
‘Terrible Awful says Charles and he means it But its so
lovely to see you
Well good luck says Carrie finally ‘Its very easy you know

getting married You just say I do whenever anyone asks you a
question’
Wed better go to the front’ Matthew tells Charles
Can you give me a moment Matthew Charles asks him
Of course’ says Matthew who thinks that Charles wants to go

to the toilet

But Charles is no longer in the right mood for his wedding He
goes into an empty side room and says Dear God please forgive
me for what I am going to say in your church - Damn Damn
Damn and hell’

‘Can I help you asks a sympathetic voice A priest steps out
from behind a curtain in the same room where he was washing
his hands It seems that the room was not empty

Oh — no thanks says Charles embarrassedI was doing some
exercises - you know for my voice This is a big church

Excellent I often do the same myself- I use rather different
words of course Ill leave you alone now

Charles still cannot come back out into the church and Tom
and Matthew are getting worried

The brides arriving now says Matthew A large black car has
driven up to the church and Henrietta gets out with her father
She is dressed finely for the wedding in white with flowers in
her hair

Well thats great’ says Tom Because weve lost the groom

Try to keep her outside for a bit’ says Matthew Ill go and
look for Charles’

Matthew says Charles brightly when he sees his best man
He is very unhappy Good to see you Tell me — what do you
think about marriage’

Well — says Matthew uncertain how to answer thisI think that
its really good ifyou love the other person with all your heart

‘Exactly’ says Charles But Ive been to so many weddings and
now its my own wedding day — and Im still thinking’

‘What are you thinking about Can I ask’

No no - better not’ says Charles

Tom is now standing at the church door talking to Henrietta
and her father Im terribly sorry’ he says The service will be a
few minutes late Theres a problem with the flowers’

With the flowers asks HenriettaWhat problem’ She clearly
doesnt want any problems on her well-planned wedding day
Henrietta gets annoyed very easily

Well says Tom thinking hard they are making some people
ill so we have to move them’

Henrietta and her father look angry but they wait at the door
People in the church are getting restless now too Theyre
wondering whats happening The bride must have arrived by
now Where is the groom

I think they believed me Tom tells Scarlett He is pleased
with himself ‘People think Im stupid you see So they dont
realize that I can tell a clever lie

David has nowjoined Matthew and Charles in the side room
Charles still wont go back into the church He is too unhappy
and confused David hits the table to make a noise so that
Charles will notice him

‘Whats happening Tell me he signs

‘Oh God Charles signs back I just saw Carrie She and

Hamish have separated’

‘Charles its your wedding day’ David tells him

Whats your advice’ Charles asks

‘Well you can do one of three things Number one just get
married as youve planned’

Charles nods

Number two you can go back and say Sorry — no wedding
today David continues

I dont like that idea’ says Charles Whats number three’

Number three - signs David Well I cant think what that is

‘Hell’ says Charles

There is a knock on the door and the priest comes in

Hello he says smiling Are you ready to meet the enemy’

Are we asks Matthew Its not really ajoke at all Everyone
looks at Charles

Yes says Charles Excellent

He tries not to look at Carrie as he walks to the front ofthe
church and sits downThe wedding music starts and Charles and
Matthew stand up together The doors at the back open and
Henrietta proud and beautiful walks down the aisle with her
father

She pulls at her fathers arm She is annoyed with him Dont
hold me so tightly Dad she whispers angrily

The priest begins to read aloud the words of the wedding
service As Charles listens to the priests words he looks confused
and worried The priest asks whether anyone thinks that Charles
and Henrietta should not get married The question is in the
wedding service because that is the law If either the bride or the
groom is already married for example then someone may say
that they are breaking the law Usually of course no one answers
the question But this time there is a loud noise David is

knocking on his wooden church seat

Im sorry — does someone want to speak the priest asks very
surprised

David puts up his hand

Yes — what is it

David of course cant speak aloud so he begins to sign to
Charles

One second says Charles as he signs back Whats going on

I thought ofidea number three David tells him

What

Will you translate

‘Translate what

Whats happening Charles asks the priest

Charles — what’ asks his bride

He wants me to translate what hes saying’ says Charles

And what is he saying asks the priest

He says I suspect that the groom is having doubts I suspect
that he would like to delay the wedding I suspect that the
groom

Really loves another woman signs David Charles does not
translate this Its true isnt it Charles Think about it because its
for the rest ofyour life Charles Its final So you must only marry
the person who you love with all your heart And - your trousers
are undone

It is a kind ofjoke but Charles looks down at the zip on his
trousers He is totally confused

Whats he saying’ asks the priest

He suspects that the groom loves another woman answers
Charles

And do you Do you Charles’

Charles is silent for a moment Everybody in the church looks
shocked They are all staring at Charles Henrietta is staring at
Charles too She cant believe this is happening

I do’ he replies in the words ofthe wedding service

Suddenly Henrietta screams She throws down her flowers and
hits Charles hard in the eye He falls over and she hits and kicks
him again She has really lost her temper this time She is very
very angry and maybe a little crazy too Some people rush to the
front of the church to help Charles Other people try to stop
Henrietta attacking him The situation gets very confused The

wedding is certainly not going to happen today
o

Back in Charless kitchen later that afternoon everyone is still
shocked Outside it is pouring with rain and the thunder crashes
in the sky

My God says Scarlett For once she doesnt really know
what to say

Well says Tom trying to be helpful At least we wont forget
this wedding I mean a lot of weddings are the same arent they
Afterwards you cant remember them at all But this one was
really different’

Yes - it didnt have a wedding service’ says Matthew in a dry
voice

Charles doesnt say anything He has a black eye

Poor girl’ says Fiona No I really mean it — poor girl OK
shes not my favourite person in the world But youve done a
terrible thing Charles — I think its quite unforgivable

Charles is shocked too He cant quite believe that he did this
Poor Hen he says I dont even want to think about it its so
awful

But ifyou werent sure that you wanted to marry her on your
wedding day then it was probably the right decision wasnt it
Tom asks

Usually Fiona is rude about everything that Tom says But
now she simply says Youre right Tom and touches his cheek

lovingly

‘Its a lovely dress’ says Scarlett Im sure itll be useful for
parties’

I blame myself signs David

What did he say asks Matthew

He says that he blames himself’ Charles translates

No shouts everyone together No you mustnt do that
David’

Yes they blame you too Charles unkindly tells his brother

The doorbell rings and everyone gets up

No says Charles Ill answer it If theres a problem its my
problem

But its Carrie at the door Its pouring with rain and shes
very wet

Hello she says

Hi God youre wet says Charles’Come in’

No no Im fine she replies Im so wet that I cant get any
wetter Do you know what I mean She smiles at him but shes
also very serious

‘OK — then Ill come out Charles says

No please dont’ says CarrieI just wanted to see ifyou were
all right I wanted to make sure that you werent killing yourself
or anything’

But Charles steps out and joins her in the rain They stand
together on the pavement and after a few seconds he is
completely wet too

‘It was wrong of me to come to the church this morning —
Im sorry I can see that youre OK so Id better go now

No — wait - Im to blame not you says CharlesI behaved really
badly today But Im sure about one thing now — marriage is not
right for me at all And I learnt another thingWhen I was standing
there in the church I realized for the first time that I totally
completely love one person with all my heart And that person

wasnt my bride Its the person whos here with me now in the rain

‘Is it still raining asks Carrie I didnt notice’

‘In fact Ive loved you since the first minute I saw youYoure
not suddenly going away again are you he asks in alarm

No I might be washed away by the rain but Im not going
away again

OK OK well go back in says Charles But first can I ask
you one thing Do you think — do you think that you could
agree not to marry me After weve got dry again of course And
after weve spent lots of time together Do you think that you
could agree not to be married to me for the rest ofyour life

Carrie looks at him her eyes very serious now

Do you he asks her

I do she answers in the words ofthe wedding service

They kiss — and above in the stormy skies of London there is

thunder and lightning for Charles too

And how does the future go Well ifwe move forwards in time
and take some more photos we see something like this

A picture of Henrietta at her wedding Shes forgotten all about
Charles now shes marrying a handsome soldier Hes wearing a
uniform with a red jacket and shes laughing as they leave the
church

And heres a picture of Charless brother David marrying
Serena They both look very sweet — a good couple

What about Scarlett Yes heres a picture of her — shes getting
married to Chester her big American Shes wearing something
different as usual — a white cow-girl hat

Theres a picture of Tom and Deirdre too taken at their
wedding reception Theyre outside Toms enormous house Toms
black dog is in the photo too and Deirdre is wearing the country
girl’ wedding dress that Carrie refused to buy

Heres one of Matthew looking happy again Hes found a
new boyfriend Hes younger than Gareth — about the same age
as Matthew Theyre at a party together Its good that Matthew
can leave all his old sadness behind

And Fiona Whos she with Well it seems to be Prince
Charles Theyre not exactly married yet but shes out with him
in public He looks serious as usual but shes wearing an
enormous pink hat and has got a big smile on her face

Charles and Carrie are still not married At least there are no
wedding photos so they cant have got married They must have
kept their promise But they do have a baby — a lovely little boy
In our photo Charles is pointing at the camera and Carrie is
smiling We can see that theyre very happy together and that

theyre getting on fine without the sound ofwedding bells
