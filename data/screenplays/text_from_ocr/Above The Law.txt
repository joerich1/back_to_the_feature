Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT
CAMERA HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH
SUPER Viet - Cambodian Border 1972 Jungle foliage
whips in the fierce downdraft as --

HUEY GUNSHIP

with US Army markings becomes discernible The chopper
lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the
wilderness We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several
machine gun positions around the LZ

EXT JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY

watch from the edge of the landing zone We recognize Nico
and Fox now in their twenties dressed in the nonmilitary
jungle attire that usually marks a CIA spook

HELICOPTER

touches down THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking in
their mid-thirties all carrying some kind of medical bags
-- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST They hit the
ground nimbly as if theyve done it many times before

LEADER OF THREE

wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled 45
NICO AND FOX

dont know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness

FOX
You ever see chemical interrogation
before

Nicos eyes stay on the approaching cowboy KURT ZAGON
for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity
NICO
These assholes are agency

NICOS POV
FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboys hand

BACK TO FOX AND NICO
FOX

Were all CIA But these guys are

from a page that aint on the map
EXT JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
Nico in the point leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical
Interrogation Team) men down an unmarked twisting trail
We see from Nicos gait that he is athletic a born leader
and totally at home in the jungle
TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON
snakes along a ridge line high enough to give us a view and

let us know these guys are way out in the boonies
ZAGON
How long till were across the border
NICO
Weve been over for the past hour
The group continues along the ridge

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT
The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks
NICO
listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back
at Zagon who stands impatiently drawing on a cigarette

ZAGON
What are you looking at hotshot

NICO
(indicates cigarette
glow)
Why dont you light a bonfire

Irritably Zagon ditches his smoke
ZAGON
Just drive the taxi ace

As the party moves out Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say
Dont fuck with these guys

EXT CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT

A pocket-fortified position Armed Cambodian lookouts
several hooches radio equipment Nico leads the party in
through the perimeter Zagon eyes the layout like hes seen
100 of them Fox indicates a hooch
FOX
(to Zagon)
Theyre in there

The three CIT men start for the hooch Nico casts a concerned
glance around at the base camp troops looking sloppy as hell
NICO

I dont trust these yo-yos
FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP
We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
to another checking the perimeter We can vaguely hear him
ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts speaking in dialect

DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO

hears a SOUND looks back toward the hooch

NICOS POV - HOOCH

Two Asian prisoners stripped to the waist babbling in-
coherently are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian
guards and hustled off into the darkness VOICES can be
heard inside the hooch A single lantern glowing inside
gives the hut a creepy frightening aspect

BACK TO NICO
Hes extremely uneasy about whats about to happen inside the
hooch

INT HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT

on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes drug vials
and surgical instruments Zagons hand picks up a hypodermic
squirt-tests it

TWO ASIAN PRISONERS

are on their knees shirtless handcuffed with heavy nylon
tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
hooch One of the subordinate CIT men moves in grabs the
first prisoner by the shoulders Zagon injects the first
prisoner Instantly the man begins shivering convulsing
Zagon watches with professional satisfaction

ZAGON
Thats the nice thing about modern
technology You dont have to wait
for results

He moves close to the first prisoner
ZAGON
(to first prisoner)

Where is it Charley You got six tons

of our shit --
The prisoner tries to speak but hes in such torment all
that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
EXT BAST CAMP - NICO

hears this horrifying cry He starts swiftly toward the
hooch --
INT HOOCH - INTERPRETER

has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
referee to two boxers The prisoner is convulsing wildly
Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair
ZAGON
Dont you die on me fucker --
FOX
(from the side)

What the hells wrong
ZAGON
(throws the prisoner
down)
This pussy cant hold his liquor

The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm

NICO

enters at this point He takes in the scene quickly moves

to a spot beside the entrance Zagon doesnt look at Nico
but its plain he is aware of Nicos presence It is as if

he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove
it to the others too

ABOVE THE LAW - Rev 41787 5

FIRST PRISONER
dies in agony on the ground

SECOND PRISONER
watches with eyes like flint He is in his mid-forties
scarred missing several fingers Probably a colonel or
higher he looks like hes been fighting these round-eyes
since the French in the 50s He is plainly one tough
customer The second prisoner meets Zagons eyes as if
daring him to use the drugs on him too Zagon eyes the
prisoner with barely contained hatred The prisoner doesnt
back down an inch
ZAGON
(to second prisoner)

So my little doctor bag doesnt

scare you eh Well I dont need

it to open your yap
Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt pulls out a
fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and
a scalpel He steps toward the prisoner displaying the
blade in the lantern light

NICO
watches impassively
ZAGON (0S)
(to prisoner)
Wheres our load you sack of slime
What did you do with my shit --
ZAGON
punches the prisoner full in the face holding the knife
handle in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
terrify him with the proximity of the blade The prisoner
crashes sideways face bloody --
ZAGON
Im gonna teach you good Im gonna
teach you never to fuck with my
opium --

28 FOX AND TWO CIT MEN

seem to know exactly what this is about
29 NICO

didnt know but the new kid on the block is catching on fast
Nico has difficulty containing his emotion Zagon stands
over the prisoner as if daring him to get back up

The prisoner gets back to his knees bloody eyes meeting
Zagons with defiance --

ZAGON
(to prisoner)
Youre a hard nigger arent you boy
You took it from the Chinks you took
it from the French Youll be fucked
if some Yankee peckerwoods gonna start
your gums flapping --
Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the
prisoner

ZAGON
-- Well youre gonna chirp for me
tough guy Youre gonna sing like a
choir --

Nico takes a step toward Zagon
NICO
What the fuck does this have to do
with military intelligence
ZAGON
Your orders are assist and observe’
cherry --
Zagon turns to face Nico --

FOX
(to Nico)
Back off partner --
Zagon turns from Nico He moves close to the second prisoner
close as a lover displaying the blade in the lamplight
ZAGON
(to second prisoner)
Im gonna start carving at your ankles
Well throw your feet in that box right
over there Then Im gonna take off
your arms --
One of the CIT men yanks the prisoners leg forward clamping
it to the ground with his hands The prisoner still hasnt
flinched He seems as locked into this dance of death as
Zagon
NICO
(cant take
much more)

Fox --
FOX
Shut up Nico

ZAGON
You can disappear as easy as this
slope kid --

Zagon starts for the prisoner Here comes the blade
Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagons shoulder Zagon spins with
terrifying quickness cocking the blade to slash at Nico
Before Zagons blow even starts Nico slams him with a
ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw Zagon literally

comes off the ground Nicos blow is so terrific Zagon drops

in an unconscious heap In a flash the two other CIT men
move to jump Nico Smash The second CIT man is swallowing
his teeth Fox leaps in the way of the third shoves Nico
out of the hooch --

30 EXT HOOCH - NIGHT

Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --

FOX
Are you crazy
(as Nico jerks free)
What the fucks the matter with you
Nico is shaking with rage and fear He takes several steps

away from the hooch then draws up abruptly Nico pulls his

-45 from his holster pops the safety starts back for the

hooch --
FOX
Nico
NICO
I dont cap him now hes gonna do me
later

The last CIT man appears gun drawn in the hooch doorway
Fox grabs Nico hauls him back again --

FOX
Ill cover this Get back to the
LZ --
(as Nico resists)

-- Ill fix it Get out Get the

fuck outa here
The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops in dialect
pointing at Nico The soldiers start toward Nico as if to
seize him Fox too starts yelling to the troops in dialect
apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men The
troops confused hold up for a moment

FOX
(to Nico)
Ill call for a chopper get outa
here
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev 42987 8

two armed prison officials

CLOSER - LARUSSO AND NICO

The old man never looks directly at Nico yet we sense keenly
that he is taking the younger mans measure
FREDERICO LARUSSO
I am only an old man An old man
with a cancer
The two are like an old and a young lion appraising each

other -- using all five senses and more
NICO
I dont have much time Uncle So

I must speak plainly
Larusso listens Nico waits for a beat Then
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev 41787 91

NICO
(this is very painful
for him)

-- For as long as Ive been old enough
to think Ive hated you and hated
everything you stood for

Larusso takes this in without a flicker

NICO
I was so sure that you and I were on
opposite sides of the fence and

that you and your people were
destroying this country --
Nico pauses glances away across the grounds

NICO
-- The most painful realization of my
life was that the people I worked for
and you are not far apart
(meets Larussos eyes)
-- And theres not much difference
between what you are and what I was

Larusso studies Nico a long moment Then takes Nicos elbow

FREDERICO LARUSSO

I will be candid with you I knew
probably before you did that you
would be coming to me I knew what
you would ask and I had every
intention of refusing you

He glances to Nico
FREDERICO LARUSSO
But it is a form of wisdom to know
when to cease relying only upon
yourself

He keeps walking

Nico nods Larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds

to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the
cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped
hands by the throat lifting him bodily slamming him
ferociously into the wall Zagon drops to the floor
half-conscious Nico spins instantly to find the Shot-
gun agent right behind him raising his weapon to Nicos
face about to pull the trigger Nico sidesteps grabbing
the mans wrist The SHOTGUN GOES OFF missing Nico by
inches blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall
The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder
holster Nico snaps the Shotgun agents wrist flipping
him through the air simultaneously grabbing the weapon
spinning behind the Noose agent then using the shotgun
barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in
Another swing wipes out Pistol agent Bad Dude now with
a clear shot aims his M-16 Nico blows him away with a
double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST In a flash Nico has spun
to Zagons surgical tool table lifted a rzor-sharp
scalpel and slashed the tape freeing his hands He
yanks the choke cable off his neck --

ZAGON - AGAINST WALL
On his feet again He reaches swiftly to the floor

snatches up his famous knife Nico confronts him -- face
battered bloody -- shaking battling internal spasms
ZAGON

Can you feel the chemicals

cherry You cant fight em much

longer --

NICO

Long enough to finish you
Sweating half-spitting Zagon slashes at Nico like an
animal -- Nico traps the knife and enters smashes Zagon
in the face with one lightning blow We see Zagons nose
and face completely cave in Nico comes under Zagons
elbow the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in
a vise-like grip and bending it backwards slowly against
the joint -- which now starts to rip in half Zagon is
screaming and cursing writhing in agony -- The drugs
have hit Nico full force now Hes weakening his eyes
are starting to roll Zagon tries one last surge of
strength to save himself it almost seems hell wriggle
free when the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken-
ing sound

As the joint hangs dangling grotesquely Nico reaches up

around Zagons neck still holding the dangling limb with
one arm He begins to now do to Zagons neck what he did
to his arm We hear a terminal CRACK Zagons body
crumples to the floor Nico in delirium staggers
