Ferris exhales loudly He tries to speak but all he can
manage is a choked gasp

TOM
What
Ferris tries again
FERRIS
(raspy)

He starts to get up Joyce gently pushes him back down

FERRIS
I have a test today I have to take it

JEANIE
(to herself)

slips out of the room Ferris brother TODD and sister

CU FERRIS

He acknowledges Tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids
INT BEDROOM JOYCE

She strokes Ferris hair

JOYCE
I hope you feel better pumpkin

She leans down and kisses his forehead Tom pats his
shoulder

TOM
Get some rest

CU FERRIS

Ferris lets out a wheeze His glassy eyes follow his parents
to the door

JOYCE (OC)
We love you sweetie

TOM (OC)
Call if you need us

They close the door The lock clicks Ferris eyes shift
from the door to CAMERA A sly little smile crawls across
his lips

FERRIS
They bought it

The MTV theme music ROARS IN

CU TV SCREEN

The TV at the foot of Ferris bed The MTV logo is playing
INT BEDROOM

Ferris yanks open the drapes The pall of the sickroom
disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight

FERRIS
Incredible One of the worst performances
of my career and they never doubted it
for a second
(looks out the window)
What a beautiful day

He turns from the window

FERRIS
Parents always fall for the clammy hands
Its physical evidence of illness Its
a good non-specific symptom Parents are
generally pretty hip to the fever scams
And to make them work you have to go a hundred
and one hundred and two You get a nervous

mother and you end up in a doctors office
and thats worse than school

He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV
broadcast A NEW SONG begins

FERRIS
Fake a stomach cramp and when youre
doubled over moaning and wailing just
lick your palms Its a little stupid
and childish but then so if high school
Right

He equalizes the sound a little

FERRIS
This is my ninth sick day with semester
If I go for ten Im probably going to
have to barf up a lung So I absolutely
must make this one count

He exits into the hallway
INT BATHROOM

Ferris walks into the bathroom Its littered with Jeans
debris He turns on the shower water

FERRIS
I dont care if youre fifty five
or seven everybody needs a day off
now and then Its a beautiful day
How can I be expected to handle
high school

He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs He pops
up

FERRIS
I do actually have a test That wasnt
bullshit

He steps into the shower Through the pebbled glass of the
shower door we see Ferris outline

FERRIS
That I care about it was

INT BATHROOM SHOWER STALL

Inside the shower Ferris hair is standing straight up
Its moulded into a fin with shampoo

FERRIS
Its on European socialism I mean
really Whats the point Im not
European I dont plan to be European
So who gives a shit if theyre socialists
They could be fascist anarchists and it
still wouldnt change the fact that I
dont own a car

He turns the shower head around and uses it like a
microphone

FERRIS
(sings)
WELL SHAKE IT UP BABY
TWIST AND SHOUT

INT HALLWAY LATER 13
Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around

his waist Hes drying his hair with another of a different
color

FERRIS
Not that I condone fascism Or
and isms Isms in my opinion

are not good A person should not
believe in an ism He should
believe in himself John Lennon
said it on his first solo album

I dont believe in Beatles I

just believe in me A good point
there Afterall he was the Walrus

He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it

FERRIS
I could be the Walrus and Id still
have to bum rides off people

He passes CAMERA and goes into his room
FERRIS (OC)
Im not very political Let me
put that into perspective
INT BEDROOM 14

Ferris tosses the towel hes dried hair with on the bed

FERRIS

My uncle went to Canada to protest
the war right On the Fourth of
July he was down with my aunt and he
got drunk and told my Dad he felt
guilty he didnt fight in Viet Nam
So I said Whats the deal Uncle
Jeff In wartime you want to be a
pacifist and in peacetime you want
to be a soldier It took you twenty
years to find out you dont believe
in anything

(snaps his fingers)
Grounded Just like that Two weeks

(pause)
Be careful when you deal with old
hippies They can be real touchy

He opens his door
INT CLOSET
The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts

FERRIS
My mother was a hippie But she
lost it She got old If she listens
to the White Album now She doesnt hear
music she hears memories Nostalgia is
her favorite drug Itll probably be
mine too I hope not

He finds a shirt he likes He steps back from the closet and
puts it on He drops the towel

INT BEDROOM

He walks across the room to his dresser He opens his
underwear drawer Theres an old model of a submarine on the
top of the dresser He picks it up

FERRIS
In eighth grade a friend of mine
made a bong out of one of these
The smoke tasted like glue

He pulls out a pair of underwear He gets dressed as he
speaks

FERRIS
His name is Garth Volbeck Hes a
serious outsider Not a bad guy I
like him Im probably his only friend

I do what I can for him I mean if

I was him Id appreciate it Do unto others

right Anyway his mother owns a gas station

His fathers dead and his sisters rumored

to be a prostitute which is complete bullshit

She only puts out so people will hang out

with her Its sad but I dont hold it

against her Better to hold it against the

guys who use her and dont care about her

(pause)

My parents never allowed Garth over here

It was because of his family Mainly his

older brother Hes in jail I could see them

not wanting his brother here because he is

a registered psycho I wouldnt want him here

I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of

artificial fruit just so he could see what

it was like to have his stomach pumped

But Garth isnt his brother It isnt his fault

that his brothers screwed-up Alot of fights

with the parents on that point I always felt

for Garth I was sleeping at his house once

and I was laying on the dark worrying that

his brother was going to come in and hack me

to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying

I asked him what was wrong and he said Nothing
Nothing was wrong There was no

specific thing he was crying about

In fact he wasnt really even aware that

he was crying He just cried himself to

sleep every night It was a habit The

guys so conditioned to grief that if

he doesnt feel it he cant sleep How

could you possibly dump on guy who has to

deal with that kinda shit My parents

acknowledge the trudge of the situation

and Im sure that deep down they do feel

for him but still the guys banned from

our house

He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet
door He doesnt like what hes wearing He continues his
speech as he disrobes

FERRIS

Unfortunately now my parents have a
legit argument Garth doesnt need his
brother to give him a rep anymore Hes
getting one on his own Hes lost Its
over for him Hes eighteen Gone from
school Gone from life His legacy is

a gas station

INT HOUSE STAIRCASE 17

Ferris comes down the stairs Hes wearing a completely
different outfit

FERRIS
One very serious danger is playing
sick is that its possible to believe
your own act

INT KITCHEN 18

Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the
refrigerator

FERRIS
That and boredom Alot of people
ditch and feel great for about an
hour Then they realize theres
nothing to do TV and food I myself
have ditched and gotten so bored I
did homework Figure that shit out

He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice

FERRIS
You have to plan things out before
you take the day off Otherwise
you get all nervous worrying about
what to do and all you get is grief
and the whole point is to take it
easy cut loose and enjoy

He crosses to the pantry

FERRIS
You blow your day and at about three
oclock when everybodys out of school
youre going to wish youd gone to
school so you could be out having
fun

He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos
FERRIS
Avoid the misery Plan your day
Do it right

INT FAMILY ROOM 19

Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair

FERRIS
Theres alot of pressure at work
in my age group And its not always
recognized

He reaches over and picks up the telephone He sets it in
his lap

FERRIS
Some guy whose hair is falling out
and his stomachs hanging over his
belt and everything he eats makes
him fart he looks at someone like
me and thinks This kids young and
strong and has a full rich future ahead
of him whats he got to bitch about

CU PHONE

He punches out a number

INT FAMILY ROOM FERRIS

He remote controls the TV on

FERRIS
Thats just one reason why I need a
day off every now and then

FERRIS
If anybody needs a day off its

to college His roommate1ll kill
him Ive come close myself But I
like him Hes a little easier to
take when you know why hes like he
is The boy cannot relax Pardon
by French but Cameron is so tight
that if you stuck a lump of coal up
his ass in two weeks youd have a
diamond

(after-thought)
And Cameron would worry that hed
owe taxes on it

father hating my guts and not

having any place to live and feeling
awkward about being the only cheer-
leader with a husband give me a
good reason why not

teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna
use Mrs Hellers home number but is cost
too much I took it again and passed But
