“After one look at this planet any visitor from
outer space would say I want to see the manager

-William S Burroughs
A starry sky hangs over a giant
costco

It’s three am in suburbia Flood lights drench an empty
football field of a parking lot The ‘T’ in the sign blinks
on and off

INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE STORE

A humongous 72-PACK OF TOILET PAPER slides along the concrete
floor It’s pushed by a middle-aged Latino SECURITY GUARD
(let’s say Luis Guzman) who edges it up against a matching
package then collapses atop his makeshift bed Ahhhh He
shuts his eyes Just then a distant

THUD Muttering The guard opens an eye

SECURITY GUARD
Frank you ain’t done cleaning up
yetI know you don’t wanna see
your wife but damn

No answer Then a SKITTERING noise The guard sits up
BEVERAGE AISLE - MOMENTS LATER

The guard tiptoes past oversized soda boxes It’s a little
unsettling in here at night--one man dwarfed amidst the huge
stacks He spots something ahead On the floor an overturned
case of CAPRI SUN juices The guard shakes his head heaves
the box back onto the shelf

SECURITY GUARD (CONTD)
New kid can’t stack for--

But something on the floor catches his eyeLIQUID Leading
off down the aisle The guard follows the trail It ends at
the foot of a towering STACK OF MICHELINS up against a wall
The guard looks up shakes his head

SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
That is one athletic rat

The guard leans on the pile of ‘vulcanized rubber’ tires
which suddenly SWIVELS AROUND taking him with it leading
him into a

DARK PASSAGE
The guards shaking hand clicks on his flashlight The liquid

trail continues down narrow metal steps into a hallway A
tangle of mechanized panels and cords Blinking lights

SECURITY GUARD (CONTD)
(sotto)
All this down here and they’re
paying me seven fifty an hour

Something drips down onto the guard’s hat He spoons a bit
off and inspects--PHOSPHORESCENT GOOP What the-- CUT TO

A THUMB AND FOREFINGER

But they’re unlike any we’ve seen before Reptilian Coated
in that goop Some kind of nanotechnology ingrained within
Between them is a tiny DRINKING STRAW

UNASSUMING VOICE (0S)
Damnit

The fingers struggle to jab the straw into a CAPRI SUN JUICE
POUCH

UNASSUMING VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
Why do they have to make it so--

The creature stops sensing something drops the juice
THE GUARD

nervously inches through a doorway Sees something at his
feet The Capri Sun and the straw Picks them up as

A BIZARRE TOOTH-FILLED JAW

stretches openright beside the guard’s face A sickly long
BLACK TONGUE extends out inches from his cheek

The guard easily jabs the straw into the juice pouch Smiles
As he attempts a sip the guard turns finally catching sight
of the fangs about to crush his noggin as we SMASH TO BLACK

INT SUNLIT UPPER EAST SIDE BEDROOM - MORNING

MARV the Boston Terrier licks the kind face of the peacefully
sleeping EVAN TRAUTWIG EVAN
(awakens hushed)
Later today Marv when you’re
napping I’m gonna lick your face
Dont say I didn’t warn you

Evan slides out of bed gently patting his sleeping wife

ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Our opening credits run as Evan waits the iPod buds in his
ears playing something fun yet hipster-approved He wears the
city uniform--black tee black jeans black Chucks An ASIAN
JOGGER enters iPod buds of his own They give each other
only the tiniest hint of acknowledgment

LEXINGTON AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

Evan walks Marv through a sea of rush hour pedestrians Each
in their own little bubble Quick strides no eye contact
Evan is at peace--this is just how he likes the world to be

TRENDY COFFEE PLACE - MOMENTS LATER

Tracking down a line of CUSTOMERS all of them either
listening to iPods texting on iPhones or talking into hands-
free cell earpieces A BARISTA hands over Evan’s usual order
while already dealing with the next person on line

STREET MOMENTS LATER

Evan plunks down change and takes a paper at A NEWSSTAND
without even looking at the GUY behind the counter Nearing
his building Evan puts a bill in the change cup of a
HOMELESS DUDE who wears a tinfoil hat and murmurs to himself

LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Evan sits at his drawing desk finishing a POLITICAL CARTOON
His wife ABBY (early-30s warm but no pushover business
suit) leans in from behind and wraps her arms around him

ABBY
(re cartoon)
It’s funny

EVAN
No it’s not

ABBY
What There’s a donkey and an
elephant and they’re the two
parties and--

EVAN
You are a terrible liar
ABBY
I hate you
EVAN
(smiles)

Again terrible

She kisses him sweetly Outside a JACKHAMMER pounds away

ABBY
(slams the window shut)
Ugh how does that not drive you
crazy

EVAN
I cant hear it over the sirens
(off her look)
Were gonna have the talk again
arent we

ABBY
No There’s no point
(unable to help herself)
But you know we wouldn’t have any
of this in the suburbs

EVAN
Youre right We wouldn’t have any
of “this” We wouldn’t have the
entire world at our doorstep
Noarthouse films noopera
noEthiopian food

ABBY
We eat pizza sit at home and
watch movies with explosions

EVAN
True but it’s nice knowing all
that other stuff is out there

ABBY
Have you noticed were alone here
All our friends have moved
somewhere with a front lawn

EVAN
They haven’t all moved
(searching)
What aboutAsian Jogger Elevator
Man Oh and there’s Riley
(off her look)
The homeless guy with the tinfoil
hat
(then)
You really think we’re gonna make
friends in the suburbs Those
people are like Walmart-super-sized
annoying Worse than that they’re
dangerous

Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009

EVAN (CONTD)

In the city you can rest easy
knowing a guy just wants to mug you
at gunpoint for your wallet But in
the suburbs there’s weird stuff
Serial killers Dateline people
Abby

(she sighs slumps he

sees softens)
You used to love it here

ABBY

(frustrated at herself)
I know I was always the cool one
But something’s changed Did you
know I want a linen closet I woke
up the other day desperately
wishing I had a closet For my
linens Ugh I’ve become that
cliched woman who wants a white
picket fence and I don’t care who
knows it They can mock me but I’1l1
shiv ‘em with a piece of white
picket and throw ‘em in my linen
closet

EVAN
See I told you there were crazy
killers in the suburbs

ABBY
(smiles softly)
Evan it’s where I want to raise
our baby

EVAN
Wait Baby You haven’t peed on
anything plastic lately have you

ABBY
(hopeful theyre trying)
No But someday soon

EVAN
(a hesitant smile)
Fingers crossed

ABBY
And wouldnt it be nice for you to
teach our son how to throw a spiral
in our own backyard
(off his look)
Wouldn’t it be nice for our son to
teach you how to throw a spiral in
our own backyard
(he smiles)

ABBY (CONTD)
Can’t we still be us--the same
people--just in a different place

EVAN
(rises faces her)
Like that little blue house you
loved

ABBY
Yes The one we saw when we got
Marv out on the Island

EVAN
The one with the red door

ABBY
Mm hmm

He takes a deep breath reaches into his pocket

EVAN
With both a top and a bottom
lock

He removes a set of HOUSE KEYS which dangle on his finger

EVAN (CONT’D)
We don’t go into a Chili’s Ever

She gasps realizing those keys belong to her dream house

ABBY
Shut up The one with the red
door

EVAN
And a huge linen closet
(then)
The 8th or 9th time you have the
conversation it starts to sink in

ABBY
(leaps into his arms)
I love you

EVAN
No TCBY No fro-yo of any kind

ABBY
(kisses him)
No Chuck E Cheese

EVAN
I shall wear no khaki pants No
chinos No Dockers No--

CANT SLEEP Sigh

EXT TRAUTWIGS’ DRIVEWAY - THE NEXT MORNING

As Evan and Abby head to the Prius Marv in tow the dog

Ammo subscription)--who waters his plants while drinking
coffee

EVAN
Marv stop that

Moments later in a CONVENIENCE STORE Evan grabs the paper
Attempts to pay silently But the CLERK (an odd deadpan dude
with a nametag which reads LINUS) won’t let him Evan
reluctantly pops out his ear buds

Ronkonkoma

EVAN
Guess I don’t have to read it then

Moments later Evan beeps the car unlocked Abby merrily
waving as she approaches A GUY hands Evan a leaflet

You) on the passenger seat without even giving it a look

Evan forces a smile says nothing as we SMASH TO

twitches under the sheet making it even harder to drift off
The silence is broken by the sound of male voices Outside

Evan tiptoes to the window spies THE CREEPY NEIGHBOR and an
IMPOSING MAN struggling to carry A LARGE CRATE to the
neighbors cellar door Evan checks the clock radio 3am

IMPOSING MAN
Is it the good stuff

CREEPY NEIGHBOR
Oh yeah This’1l do some damage

Sensing something the imposing man turns towards Evan who
recedes into the shadows Abby’s foot twitches again Evan
gently touches it and the twitching calms He smiles a
little shakes his head at himself

INT COSTCO - THE NEXT DAY

Bob rests his hand proudly on Evan’s shoulder

BOB

bottle

Morgan narrows his eyes at Evan

MORGAN
You find that funny New Guy

EVAN
(panicked)
What No And New Guy isn’t really--
because-- I’m not one of them

Bob removes his hand disappointed Morgan leans in to the

frightened Evan

MORGAN
Smart Because these are not men
These are walking vaginas

JAMARCUS
That explains why you’re not
remotely interested in us

Morgan takes out his nightstick Brussels holds him back

BRUSSELS
You don’t wanna lose any more

Jamarcus turns the key in the ignition but the engine
SPUTTERS Bob looks to Jamarcus that really ruined my
dramatic parting shot Then determined to get it right

job of lying to them Go through
the bare minimum motions of being
an actual Neighborhood Watch

eye on Like a possible domestic
terror situation in the house next
door to mine

seventeen with a little moustache on her upper lip She
flips the ball up in the air and scissor kicks it to Bob

bottle it up and then we’re a
‘couple with issues’ and then we
can’t laugh anymore when we watch
Doctor Phil because it’s all too
real

Evan eases a bit Maybe he’s just being ridiculous Crumples

Evan grabs Bob’s arm desperate
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 48

EVAN

INT TRAUTWIGS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Evan rushes through the door hurries up the stairs

EVAN
Abby there’s something I have to
tell you--

He swings open the bedroom door to find candles lit Seal
plays on the stereo Abby approaches seductive

ABBY
There’s something I have to tell

She smiles kisses him
INT PAUL’S HOUSE - THE NEXT NIGHT

Paul sits on his couch watching Grey’s Anatomy while sipping
a hot cocoa and petting his Rottweiler

IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CAR
The team sits enshrouded in darkness a safe distance up the

block Evan watches Paul intently through binoculars The
others are bored Franklin eats Reese’s Pieces
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 49

JAMARCUS
Yup This guy’s an alien And I’m
pretty sure that old dude next
door’s a vampire

FRANKLIN
Hey Evan do you know who shot
JFK too

Paul gets up heads toward another room out of their line of
sight Evan opens his door

EVAN
He’s moving C’mon

Evan pops out of the car Bob goes along

BOB
This oughta be good

JAMARCUS
Well stay here in case he gets in
his spaceship

Evan and Bob take cover behind some bushes as Paul (in his
kitchen) rinses his cup

BOB
Dishwashing Classic alien
behavior

EVAN
Shut up

BOB
Why do us suburban types freak you
out so much

EVAN
Well aside from the whole alien
thing I guess it has something to
do with conformity

BOB

I see And you’re some kind of an
original right You think
everybody on the Lower East Side
doesn’t look exactly like you If
youd stop trying to be different
for two seconds you’d see how
special it is to be a part of
something It’s time you embraced
change Evan Time you moved on

(sees something)
That little punk
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 50

Upstairs in his bedroom JASON does bicep curls He’s ripped
Evan looks at Bob a question of his own

EVAN
Why do you really go to those
soccer games Bob

BOB
It’s good money

EVAN
Your daughter isn’t “sidelined” is
she She just doesn’t wanna play
anymore
(then)
Maybe you’re the one who needs to
move on huh You have to let her

grow up

BOB
No I don’t

EVAN
Bob--

BOB

We were buddies you know When
she’d have a cold I’d hold the
tissue up to her nose and shed
blow I’m not talking about five
years ago This was last year
Evan One summer and three bra
sizes later she’s got Tom Brady
Junior licking his chops

(then)
It’s my own fault really I
married a hot piece of ass Add in
my obvious physical gifts and we
were bound to have attractive
offspring

(then)
Youre a lucky man Evan

Paul’s PHONE RINGS He answers Nods Hangs up Quickly grabs
his sweater and heads out

EVAN
He’s leaving

ANOTHER STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Pauls car turns off into a less developed area--woods on the
edge of town The Neighborhood Watch car follows
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 51

EVAN (CONT’D)
Where is he going

BOB
There’s nothing out here but a
bunch of old farms Oh and there’s
that giant meteor crater

EVAN
Really

BOB
Nope I knew this’d be fun

Paul turns into a long driveway Our guys pull over
FARM - MOMENTS LATER

The Watch guys tiptoe through pine trees approaching the
farmhouse Paul’s car is parked alongside several others Out
in a field a truck runs its bright headlights ablaze But
there’s nothing out there but a couple old cows

Paul helps a woman out from one of the other cars It’s a
very pregnant woman CAROLYN

Carolyn’s husband DAN gets out of the car and helps as well
They head towards the field A few other people have
gathered what appears to be their extended FAMILY

BOB (CONTD)
That’s the whole Novack family
They buy a lot of chicken Get
their photos developed with us and
not the Photomat Good people

The guys huddle behind the barn to get a better look
PAUL
Okay Carolyn let’s get you
ready
Carolyn sits down on the ground Spreads her legs
EVAN
That’s great But what are they
doing out here
Paul pulls up her dress and removesA FAKE BELLY

CAROLYN
Ahh man that feels good

Dan drags the cow nearby
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 52

DAN
Here you go Paul

PAUL
Just relax Papa

Paul touches the cow around its midsection
PAUL (CONTD)
Mm hmm It’s time
(then)
Let’s hold hands

Paul and Dan join the family The cow stands there The Watch
guys share a look A beat And then the cowEXPLODES

Cow guts shoot everywhere Some even land on our guys

FRANKLIN
That just happened

Bob the guts cleared away finally sees Evan’s face
paralyzed with fear Bob turns now to see

A STRANGE CREATURE
hatch out of the cattle remains It unfurls really our first
chance to glimpse one of our aliens head on Baby size And
it’s not pretty Jaws gnashing Ooze dripping
BOB
(freaked)
Okay maybe they’re aliens

FRANKLIN
Holy--

Jamarcus covers Franklin’s mouth
Paul calmly steps over and grabs the baby alien cradling it

PAUL
Its a boy

Paul clears its mouth and it begins to cry--really horrid
shrieking noises--thrashing about violently

CAROLYN
Oh Dan he has your fangs

DAN
Mine are not that big

The Watch guys are horrified
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 53

EVAN
In there

They rush into
THE BARN

Latch the big doors behind them Take cover behind some bales
of hay Catch their breath

JAMARCUS
This is not good This is not good

Evan collapses in the hay not noticing that he is right
beside A SLEEPING BABY ALIEN which stirs a tiny bit A wider
shot reveals A DOZEN SLEEPING BABIES spread throughout the
barn But our guys don’t see them

BOB
What the hell are they Evan

EVAN
I don’t know any more than you
Theyre aliens

FRANKLIN
Maybe theyre like communicate
through song make old people young
aliens

BOB
Or kill humans for sport put our
skulls on their ship aliens

EVAN
Pretty sure it’s the latter

Bob and Jamarcus stare at Evan eyes wide

EVAN (CONTD)
What is it now

BOB
(hushed)
Nothing Chill Whatever you
dodon’t turn around

Evan turns Behind him the nearest BABY ALIEN has just
awakened from its slumber

JAMARCUS
Just be cool It’s only a baby
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 54

EVAN
(through his teeth)
I’m terrible with babies

Slowly we see the other dozen babies awaken quite cranky
jaws dripping

BOB
I think we’re in their nursery

JAMARCUS
And it’s feeding time

EVAN
Plan Anyone

BOB
I’m gonna go with scream like a
girl and run for my life

FRANKLIN
Second

And they do just that the baby aliens chasing after They
throw open the rear door of the barn rumbling out into a

FIELD

Lying against the barn are a few kids’ DIRT BIKES The guys

hop on struggle to pedal away from a SEA OF HUNGRY PIRANHA

ALIEN BABIES Evan struggles to keep up-his bike is packing
a pair of training wheels

A SCREECH Evan spins back to find an alien baby riding on
those training wheels teeth bared Evan screams and
instinctively hacks at the thing slapping it off

EVAN
Oh god I just hit a baby
BOB
Maybe you should’ve just given it a

timeout

Another jumps up into Franklin’s basket right in his face
Franklin SCREAMS The alien baby screams back Then tilts its
head looking at something the Reese’s in Frank’s front
shirt pocket

FRANKLIN
Oh you got a sweet tooth huh

Franklin gives it the Reese’s The baby alien eats the entire
bag bag included Slumps down in the basket calmly burps
smiles at Franklin Franklin smiles weakly
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 55

A full moon hangs overhead They approach A DRAINAGE DITCH a
long way down The creatures chasing behind Nowhere else to
turn

JAMARCUS
Pissballs

EVAN
What do we do

BOB
(sees Franklin realizes)
We gotta fly Tell your friend to
make us fly Frank

Running out of roomthe ditch fast approaching

FRANKLIN
Um Mr Alien Baby Excuse me Not
sure if you can do this but could
you please make us fly

Just a few feet left The alien babyspits up orange

yellow and brown baby puke then leaps from the basket to the
ground as

To John Williams’ moving Theme from ET our guys surge off
a cliff andfall into a drainage ditch SPLOOSH SPLOOSH
SPLOOSH They land in a river of murky water below

One by one the guys pop up gasping for air grabbing a hold
of floating jetsam as the current carries them away

The baby aliens stop short at the precipice their shrieks
echoing in the night Paul joins them our guys long gone
gently patting an alien baby’s head
PAUL

Shhh It’s okay The scary humans

are gone now
EXT DOWNSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
The soggy guys struggle to climb out of the ditch

JAMARCUS
Make us fly Great plan

Finally safe the reality sinks in for the breathless Bob

BOB
He could have his tentacles all
over her--

SLAP Evan smacks Bob across the face

BOB (CONTD)
What was that for

EVAN
I was trying to calm you down

SLAP Bob smacks Evan back

EVAN (CONTD)
Ow You’re not supposed to hit me
back in those circumstances

BOB
I just saw a bunch of goddamn
aliens There are no more rules

EVAN
I know You don’t think I’m
freaked But remember how you
reacted to me You can’t just tell
people there are aliens--

BOB
The police We have to call the
police
EVAN
Theyre aliens
JAMARCUS

FRANKLIN

What about the FBI CIA--

EVAN

Bob marches back towards town determined The others follow

JAMARCUS
Those things were just the babies
What the hell are we gonna do We
got a couple dudes and some car

EVAN
It’s crazy but Bob’s right Until
we have some kind of proof there’s
nobody else to turn to Now where

Totally pimp

BOB
Lets put a pin in that Ese First
we need information

JAMARCUS
Where are you gonna get information

Off Bob’s look CUT TO
INT LINUS’ HOUSE - LATER

Linus sits in a ratty old chair wearing an open bathrobe and
Kang and Kodos boxer shorts

LINUS
What’d they look like

The Watch guys are crammed together on Linus’ couch trying
to avert their eyes from his crotch

EVAN
Well they have this slimy green
skin--
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 58

LINUS

(completely blasé)
Reptilian texture Embedded
nanotech Piercing eyes that haunt
you not only in your sleep but in
your waking hours as well Yeah
that’s them So they’re abducting
you guys too huh

EVAN
No we justhappened upon them

BOB
So they reallytake you

LINUS
Every third Thursday

EVAN
That’s horrible

LINUS
Eh I fought it for the first
couple decades But eventually you
realize it’s easier to just go with
the flow

The TV flickers Linus jiggles the frayed power cord (which
is plugged into an absurdly overloaded socket ) without any
visible concern for his well-being This man is over it

JAMARCUS
Whatdo you know about them

LINUS
Oh I gathered quite a bit of info
back in the day before I realized
sounding batshit bonkers is not the
best way to meet women Even got my
hands on some of their
technology

DARK SHED —- MOMENTS LATER

A garage door rolls up Linus pulls a chain to illuminate his
conspiracy room its centerpiece a

MAKESHIFT SPACESHIP

Coated with a thick layer of dust Like an old Trans-Am
somebody would keep up on blocks in their yard tinkering
with it but never getting it to start

It’s very piecemeal none of the parts really matching
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 59

EVAN
How did you--

LINUS
Parts pieced together from wrecks
These guys crash all the time Very
lax drunk flying laws Back when my
life still had any semblance of
hope I used to have a dream That
da fly up in a ship like theirs--

EVAN
And be free of them forever

LINUS
No I was gonna abduct them and
make them pay bitterly for what
they’d done to me

BOB
Does it work

LINUS
Not in the technical sense

Jamarcus peruses a giant gun krazy glued to the side

LINUS (CONT’D)
That’s an ion cannon from an X-
Wing I just thought it looked rad

The walls of the shed are covered with conspiracy-laden book
shelves and alien-related news clippings (we might notice the
one on cattle mutilation Linus mentioned in the convenience
store) Evan spies one

THE FRONT PAGE of the Roswell Daily Record A black and white
photo in which A FARMER poses in front of tin-foil remnants

EVAN
(reading)
Roswell New Mexico July 7th
1947 Ranch hand discovers “flying
disc”

BOB
That was real The whack jobs have
been claiming that for years

LINUS
Yeah that’s you now Chief
(then)
But what those whack jobs don’t
talk about is this
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 60

Linus points to another clipping

THE FRONT PAGE of New York Newsday Another BandW photo An
OLDER MAN and his middle-aged SONS hold SHOVELS and smile
farmland behind them TEPPERTOWN BREAKS GROUND

LINUS (CONT’D)
May 7th 1947--exactly two months
earlier--Alexander Tepper and Sons
announce their plan to build 2000
homes on an old potato farm on Long
Island thus creating the world’s
first suburb Coincidence I think
not

EVAN
I told you this place was weird

LINUS
The truth isn’t out there kiddies
It’s right here In our own
backyard

BOB
Youre saying this town was
actually created by aliens

LINUS
Not just this town C’mere

Linus returns to the Roswell photo

LINUS (CONTD)
Look closer

They do As do we And there in the midst of the fake-
looking spaceship debris we can clearly see

EVAN
A shovel

LINUS
I’m pretty sure the Roswell dudes
were supposed to break ground on a
West Coast Teppertown But as I
said they like their cocktails

Linus has tacked AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS of suburban communities
from many different states to the wall ENCINO CA WAUKEGAN
IL COLUMBIA MD BELLEVUE WA GARLAND TX TEPPERTOWN NY
All identical

With the same houses we have Laid

EVAN
But why What do they want

FRANKLIN
Maybe they’re looking for
something

LINUS
No clue Frankie But if it was in
me they woulda found it a long time
ago

EVAN
They said something about Moving
Daysaid it was coming soon

LINUS
Never heard of it

Offscreen a DING

EVAN
(freaked)
What was that

LINUS
I’m making them nachos

INT KITCHEN —- MOMENTS LATER
Linus takes the nachos out of the oven

JAMARCUS
Why would you ever do something
nice for them

LINUS
It’s purely selfish I find the
whole thing’s over with a lot
quicker when they have a snack
waiting afterwards

FRANKLIN
I’m the same way

EVAN
So how do we find out what they’re
up to I mean anybody could be an
alien
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 62

BOB
Exactly We gotta smoke these guys
out Find out who’s on Team Martian
and who isn’t

Jamarcus bites into a nacho Blech

JAMARCUS
Oh man there’s no cheese

LINUS
Yeah just beans and guac I don’t
know why but the aliens hate
cheese

Evan’s face lights up An idea

EVAN
I think it’s time I got to know the
neighbors

INT TRAUTWIGS’ KITCHEN - LATER

Evan walks in carrying shopping bags filled with burgers and
tons of CHEESE

EVAN
Guess what awesome suburban couple
is having a BBQ

ABBY
Nah uh

EVAN
Yuh huh You were right We should
have a little housewarming soiree
for all our new nabe friends
(trying to play it cool)
And you can invite our buddy Paul
to thank him for the super lunch

Nothing could make her happier She leaps into his arms the
shopping bags falling to the floor

EXT THE TRAUTWIGS’ BACKYARD - THE NEXT DAY

Another oppressively hot day Evan presses down a piece of
cheese on a patty with a spatula He looks up over the grill
lid paranoid scanning the pleasant party with steely eyes

Bob stuffs his face carrying a CHEESE TRAY past Morgan and
Brussels
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 63

torte Three types of cheese
Gorgonzola Mascarpone and she
tops it off with a layer of Cheese
Whiz It’s like eating Jesus

MORGAN
No thanks Finnerty I’m not a big
cheese guy

BOB
Oh really

BRUSSELS
Good More for me

Brussels gobbles a cheese-laden cracker down Evan sees
confused He knows Brussels is an alien

Evan turns to Paul who chuckles with Creepy Neighbor They
both eat CHEESEBURGERS heavy on the cheese

Bob conspires with Evan

BOB
Weve got these jagweeds right
where we want ‘em

EVAN
No we don’t The ones we already
know are eating cheese That whack
job was wrong

Abby approaches hugs her husband

ABBY
Hello gorgeous You’re sweating
like my Uncle Vito

BOB
It’s this Indian Summer Or do you
have to say Native American summer
now

ABBY
I hope our guests aren’t dying

Evan takes another scan of the party By the cooler Franklin
presses a cold Yoo Hoo to his brow Bonnie fans herself with
a paper plate But Morgan and Brusselsaren’t sweating at
all Huh

EVAN
They seem fine
Neighborhood Watch - Jared Stern - March 11 2009 64

COFFEE Then were

BACK TO SCENE

EVAN (CONTD)
(hushed to Bob)
They don’t sweat

An arm wraps around Evan a bit too tight It’s Paul No

meal Evbo

EVAN
Of course

I’1l have to have you sometime
Evan looks at him Does he know I know

PAUL (CONT’D)
You boys up for a little exercise

EVAN
Excuse me

SMASH TO
A SILVER DISC SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR
WHOMP The FRISBEE nails Franklin in the face The Watch guys
and alien dudes have gathered on the front lawn Paul picks
up the Frisbee smiles at Evan

EVAN
Huh Yeah Never heard it called
that before

PAUL
So How ‘bout afriendly little
game
EVAN
(eyes Bob)

Sure Be nice tobreak a sweat

Moments later The Watch guys are huddled up The alien guys
in a huddle of their own ten yards back

EVAN (CONTD)
Any one of them isn’t sweating
pretty sure he’s a space cadet

FRANKLIN
Jamarcus isn’t sweating

JAMARCUS
I’m descended from Africans This
is like winter for me

ALIEN HUDDLE
Break

We begin a hardcore game of Ultimate Frisbee in which Team
Martian have amazing skills no doubt heightened by the fact
that they are aliens They can jump higher run faster and
are incredibly strong But they also have the dexterity of a
hippie with years of Frisbee tossing experience Finger

spins behind the back the pop off the top of the hand and
catch move

Bob takes things super-seriously frustrated after they give
up a touchdown

MORGAN
You protect that end zone about as
well as you protect this town

BOB
You’re totally gay

FRANKLIN
Good one

Evan is more concerned about checking who’s sweating and
who’s not He gets HEADLOCKED by a guy but turns his
attention to a sweat-free armpit
Neighborhood Watch Jared Stern - March 11 2009 66

EVAN
(choked to himself)

The aliens score time after time after time kicking the shit
out of our guys Particularly Paul abusing Evan Finally in
a huddle exhausted

BOB
Okay Ev the Predator over there
is jumping every route Stop n’ go
Ill pump fake and you’re free for

At the line Hike Evan runs the route Paul bites hard on
the pump fake leaving Evan wide open for the touchdown Bob
hurls it beautifully just before he’s slammed to the turf
Paul suddenly turns on his alien jets speeding up to even

with Evan As the disc arrives they both leap for it

In the air Paul cheap shots Evan ELBOWING him in the jaw
As our hero collapses to the ground Paul catches the
Frisbee returning the interception for a touchdown with sick
football moves (beefy Alec Baldwin suddenly spinning on a
dime like Barry Sanders) leaving all our guys crumpled in the
dust The aliens do an annoying choreographed touchdown
dance

SMASH TO
INT FALLOUT SHELTER - THAT NIGHT

Bruised and battered the guys have gathered in their lair
some with ice packs on muscles The place has been turned
into a shabby version of a police station White boards A

coconspirators Paul at its apex Jamarcus holds up a photo
of headlock guy

Jamarcus adds him to the Wire board Headphones around his
neck Franklin pops a VHS tape out of an old VCRTV combo and
places it atop a stack of tapes (Aliens The Day the Earth
Stood Still ID4 Star Wars Meet Dave)

thought to rinse and reuse zip-loc
baggies

PAUL
Y’gotta start somewhere

She smiles That’s just what she always says He puts his
hand on hers A bit too forward She pulls it away

ABBY
Evan loves zip-loc baggies My
husband Evan Likes to suck out

LINUS

Don’t worry It’s fine They’ve done

Linus scratches at his side a weird nervous tic The guys
share an anxious look Suddenly a noise whirling Something
is above them A SHIP cloaked A BEAM OF LIGHT shoots down
Linus slowly disintegrates ala Star Trek only cooler

INT SHIP - BEAMING COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Linus rematerializes the shadows of two aliens looming over
him He holds out the nachos As one’s about to eat one

LINUS

microwave and it’s like they’re
fresh out of the oven

The aliens exit with the nachos Linus rushes to a control
panel all business

BACK DOWN IN THE YARD

The Watch guys wait when another light finally appears They
each try to shove another forward

ALL

Finally A SQUIRREL runs out into the light Looks up
mesmerized Then EXPLODES in a ball of flames The guys’
faces drop

UP IN THE BEAMING COMPARTMENT

Linus alone hurries at the controls

He quickly scribbles something on a piece of paper

Something materializes It’s a PIECE OF PAPER Bob runs out

Again a beam of light The guys share a look hold hands
and JUMP INTO THE LIGHT

BEAMING COMPARTMENT

everything is where it belongs

LINUS
Hurry they’1ll be right back

The guys hustle out into the HALLWAY It’s a small ship
Three compartments off this one corridor They pass the
CONTROL COMPARTMENT peeking in the window to see

THREE ALIENS Adult aliens now in terrifying full form as
theysmoke cigars and drink One Headlock Guy from the
Frisbee game pilots the ship taking off into the night sky
Two others (whose voices we should recognize as Morgan and
Brussels) stand nearby Morgan takes the nachos out of an
alien microwave loves ‘em

MORGAN
He remembered I don’t like cheese

HEADLOCK GUY

spreading disinformation with the
whole probing thing You guys sure

The greenscreen behind them changes to an image of the
aliens’ HOME PLANET with its weird breathing
extraterrestrial cities packed to the gills with beings

KRELKOR
Why not consider Earthwood Estates
It’s not far is it Sandy

The video shows all of Earth turned into ONE GIANT ALIEN
SUBURB

SANDY
That’s right Krelkor Just a ten
trillion mile commute

KRELKOR
Earthwood is a safe gated

recognize from our prologue)

PAUL
It wasbefore we got here
Hi I’m Paul Sloan President of
Earthwood Estates Please excuse my
hideous human appearance but I’m
speaking to you from our luxurious
Hive right here in Teppertown New
York where our project first broke
ground over fifty human-years ago
It’s true when we landed this
planet was far too chilly for our
species

He enters a LABORATORY where alien SCIENTISTS are hard at
work

PAUL (CONT’D)
But thanks to our global warming
initiative

We see the scientists’ creations Aerosol hairspray
Disposable diapers A shot of Paul’s “recycling facility”
where cardboard and plastic is not being renewed but
INCINERATED

EVAN
Son of a bitch

PAUL
-all that’s changed Our experts
initially estimated it would take a
hundred years to hit the objective
temperature

Images of smokestacks spewing pollutants People guzzling
bottled water A freeway packed with SUVs

PAUL (CONT’D)
But they didn’t count on the
stupidity of the human race Yes
people bought into our program so
completely that we’ve achieved
target conditions a full forty
years ahead of schedule

EVAN
That means

PAUL
That’s right friends Moving Day
is this Friday

Krelkor acts really badly Mr No Fun careful purchaser

KRELKOR
Conquering a whole planet in a day
That sounds like a big job

Back in the underground lair Paul stands by a giant
crystalline POWER SOURCE

PAUL
It is That’s why right here at
our Hive we maintain enough
crystals to power the entire
attack

A simulation plays in which the world’s metropolises are
zapped with LASER BLASTS from every angle as if encircled by
cannons The Watch guys react in horror

Finally Krelkor and Sandy are in suburban wedded bliss in a
breathing oozing alien dwelling with a cute red door

SANDY
So hurry up and claim your little
piece of heaven before it’s too
late

Paul steps in front of this greenscreened image

PAUL
Because this place is going And
going fast

walls leaping right over Evan’s head They completely trash
the garage as Evan winces screams They are slightly
different variations but we can tell them apart by their

From a shelter Here in Teppertown

The two dogs land across the garage from each other size
each other up Simultaneously they leap at each other
clashing in mid air A YELP Dahmer sinks the floor licking
his wounds whimpering

Marv wields his spiky tail Is he going to finish off the
creature SLICE Marv slashes all of Evan’s ropes so close
to Evan’s skin that his t-shirt probably has a little rip
