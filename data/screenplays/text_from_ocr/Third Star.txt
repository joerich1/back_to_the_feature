EXT A CHURCH YARD STACKPOLE

OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE

MUSIC

An extraordinarily green and lush rural graveyard

CLOSE UP Slow motion The whirling head of a strimmer
sweeps through the lush grass reaping it down to the roots
It moves over the contours of the old unkept graves sunken
and rounded by time knocking over small vases of flowers
and keepsakes some new some long-forgotton

ANGLE ON

MILES (29 handsome possessing a natural confident charm
impeccably dressed in black) stares at a gravestone He
looks at the sky Clear blue

Close in on James’ face (JAMES 29 very thin) He is very
still Behind him is a twinkling firmament in which he
appears to be floating He stares straight down the lens

INT JAMES HOUSE PANTRY - DAY GILTAR GROVE

DAVY (29 handsome strong earnest and trendy) stands
holding an armful of jam jars each filled with home made
pickled produce We see the legs of James’ Mother (MRS
GRIFFITH) who is up a setpladder passing more jars down to
him He is exasperated but infinitely patient The alarm
on Davy’s watch goes off He manages to turn it off and
wonders how much longer this will take

CUT TO

EXT JAMES HOUSE - GARDEN GILTAR GROVE

BILL (29 Scottish an urban surf bum) emerges from the
darkness of a barn With what seems like Herculean strength
he is carrying something above his head We don’t see all
of it just the general size of it and that it’s some kind
of mechanical contraption
Bill is struggling to hold it aloft with triumph ceremony
and excitement Then sudden PANIC as his arms judder

EXT A CHURCH YARD STACKPOLE 5

Miles at the gravestone lost in thought Suddenly he
starts getting hit by small flecks of greenery In fact
he’s being splattered all over by them

SMASH CUT

A scruffy GROUNDSMAN 55 wearing ear protectors and a face-
shield is strimming the grass of the churchyard with a
petrol strimmer edging backwards towards Miles The
strimmer is throwing up the mulched grass flecks

Miles looks down at his smart clothes now covered in grass
as if this was somehow inevitable The groundsman edges
closer - still unaware of Miles Miles pokes him lightly in
the back The groundsman turns round Miles gestures with a
slow sweep of his hand to show that he is covered in grass
mulch

The groundsman looks at the mess He nods slowly with
resignation Using the same gesture he points out that his
tattered old overalls are also covered

Miles nods slowly This is obviously going to be one of
those days weeks months years

He breaks into a laugh
PULL OUT TO REVEAL

James on his bed in front of a huge poster of the
firmament holding a small camera in front of himself

Davy enters carrying James’ shoes James shows him the
images on the camera
DAVY
Your mum just made me do CPR on
on one of Chloe’s old dolls

JAMES
At least one of us is getting
some

Davy nods Resigned

JAMES (CONTD)
Do you know CPR

James looks at the shoes With one hand in each he ‘tap
dances’ them on the tray table beside him

DAVY
No But that doll did give me a
semi

JAMES

If I didn’t know better Sherpa
Davy I’d say you’ve cleaned
these shoes

Davy smiles and shrugs as he starts sorting out his
medication almost like a croupier with chips and cards
Swift and professional

James puts on one shoe himself But he is struggling with
the other Davy sees and comes over to help

Still seeing only part of the contraption including one of
its shiny wheels and a tyre Bill and MR GRIFFITH (James’
father 65 vague engineering genius) stare at it

BILL
You’ve done it Mr Griff now
ANYTHING is possible

Long pause Mr Griffith seems to seriously consider this
and conclude that the statement can’t be accurate

MR GRIFFITH
Well

They stare at the cart Mr Griffith kicks a tyre gently

EXT JAMES GARDEN 10

James sits on a garden chair and looks back at the house
where a lunch party is in full swing Family and friends
fill the house James’ mother and Chloe pass around food at
his family and friends Bill tucks into mountains of food
as he talks to Chloe’s husband MIKE (He is 40 gentle
square) He looks bored

Chloe’s children examine Mr Griffith’s face scientifically
as he explains wrinkles

Mrs Griffith and Davy check the taste of a salad dressing
Davy suggesting a little more balsamic

Chloe and Mrs Griffiths put food out side by side Chloe
adjusts the plate layout and immediately Mrs Griffith
swaps it back round and walks out James chuckles and looks
at the sky

EXT JAMES’ GARDEN - DAY GILTAR GROVE 12

Miles comes to the conservatory unaware that James has seen
him Davy and Bill go to greet him with cheers

Chloe’s two little girls rush to him He picks them up and
showers them with unashamed affection He puts them down
and hugs Chloe and shakes her husband’s hand

Miles has a charming word for everyone He’s greeted with
love and laughter by all but then he sees James

Miles’ face betrays a moment of shock at James’ appearance
He approaches and sits in a chair opposite

They look at each other in silence with malevolent
enigmatic power barely contained (before engaging in their
normal meaningless banter)

JAMES

MILES

wrapped in hesian It’s about eight feet tall

BILL
This is a tree

Silence

BILL (CONTD)

noting the sting Mr Griffith joins them

can’t just tell the board

He takes his overnight bag When he shuts the boot he sees
Chloe with her husband Mike and their young girls
blowing bubbles The sun is shining through Chloe’s summer
skirt She looks at Miles and smiles

MILES (CONTD)
(Still on the phone)
What will we have by Tuesday
It was mine to lose Mac We did
everything right We’1ll see
Bye

Miles ends the call and shakes his head He looks at the
view He struggles to take a deep breath He is obviously
not coping too well behind his smile He takes out his
mobile He types out a text “I LOVE YOU” Then he deletes
it without sending it He shakes his head He tries to
breathe deeply again but it seems he can’t fill his lungs

INT JAMES HOUSE THE BARN - DAY GILTAR GROVE 14

James is sitting on the cart Mr Griffith Bill and Davy
are admiring what we now see is a Go-cart that Bill was
carrying earlier It is built from what is obviously an old
go-cart but with new shining wheels and handles attached
to push it from behind It has “APOLLO 18” painted on it

The boys examine it with quiet wonder Miles comes in as
the others try out the pushing handles

DAVY
(Seeing Miles approach)

Mr Griffith looks confused then remembers and nods

Mum went mad You didn’t

MR GRIFFITH
I was livid I want to hit you
now

James laughs but he’s tired Mr Griffith looks at the
floor But he puts his hand on James face and holds it
there for a moment He just can’t speak He goes to

leave

Then Mr Griffith stops and turns around

MR GRIFFITH
When we nearly lost you even as
I dived into the sea my mind was
racing ahead Even in the panic
my mind was playing out how
I’d try to live without you And
I couldn’t And the water was
like treacle And then you
weren’t moving and I passed you
up to the people in the boat and
I didn’t watch

JAMES
It’s funny I think I remember
It was peaceful

MR GRIFFITH
I doubt it You were three If
you hadn’t spluttered your way
back I don’t think I’d have come
back from the water either I
mean I would have I would
have been walking breathing
but drowned for the rest of my
life Then you were OK Crying
Shocked And OK AndI thought-
I thought we’d taken your
gamble and we’d won

James nods

MR GRIFFITH (CONTD)

luxurious new one James watches the exuberant chaos with
pleasure as Davy Miles and Bill pass back and forth

parents and Chloe and takes it to the house sourly

triumphant

BILL

Nearby Bill and Miles have some tea brewed on Bill’s
camp stove and biscuits They look over to James then to
each other and say nothing Bill tops up his tea with hot
water It’s not as good now so he dunks his biscuit

BILL
Biscuits - they’re great on their
own but once they get dipped
in tea they become a whole
different journey

Miles laughs
BILL (CONTD)

MILES
Youve honestly honestly never
watched that Green Peace footage
of baby seals getting clubbed and
thought yeah Cruel Ban it -
but just after I’ve had a go

James roars with laughter
Nearby Davy and Bill are fixing the cart
DAVY
I decide in the confusion of
whether he’s joking or not that
he probably is
BILL
Mate HE doesn’t even know if
he’s joking
Back to Miles and James

JAMES
How’s work actually going

Miles looks at him with suspicion

MILES
You hate what I do

JAMES
Only because you do Are you

MILES

I’m so bored of the Laura and ‘my
book’ questions I’m not a
writer Jim I’m an ad’man I’m
good at it Let’s just talk about

Bill and Davy join them

DAVY
I’m just saying we should stow

The boys see The White Bull below A fisherman’s tavern on
a small quayside nestled in a tiny cove There’s a
celebration in progress a small colourful pagan festival
A pig is roasting on an open spit The locals stand around
near the quay in front of the pub

BILL
Perfect

CUT TO

EXT THE WHITE BULL STACKPOLE QUAY 33

The boys get some funny looks as they move through the mini-
festival The locals are letting their hair down A band
(young and very good) are playing on the back of a trailer
Bill loves it Davy is worried that people will bump James
and acts as a human shield James and Miles look around
bemused

A flat bed lorry is decorated with hay bales and streamers
A large throne is empty in the middle and a crown lies
abandoned on the seat Amongst the locals are some costumed
characters (a GOAT a BEAR a strange HUMAN TREE carrying a
horn that he blows drunkenly from time to time and asmall
boy dressed as an ANGEL )

The boys find a few bales to sit on near the edge of it all
and bask in the atmosphere Davy takes the silver meds kit
out James shakes his head Davy doesn’t like it but puts
the meds away

BILL
Fuck it’s good to be back here
I’‘1l get the beers in

Bill bounds off towards the bar

JAMES
I‘1l have a Guinness

Bill hesitates for a second then nods James looks at Davy
for a moment who stops himself from objecting

JAMES (CONTD)
I’ve never taken LSD and lost my
shoes playing poker I’ve never
had a gun held to my head by
bandits I’ve never sailed the
globe single-handed

DAVY
I’ve never been to Birmingham

JAMES
You know what I mea - Really

Davy nods James is sidetracked by this
Miles walks away towards the toilets
JAMES (CONTD)
Don’t you ever want to do

something dangerous

DAVY
Eat some under-cooked pig

JAMES
Have a real MAN-THRILL

DAVY
Steady

JAMES
None of us remember the day the
moment we realised we weren’t
actually going to play in the
world cup final or be the first
man on Mars It’s too fucking
embarrassing because it
happens so late

Davy says nothing

DAVY
I have no response to that

JAMES
That gives me great comfort

BEAT

DAVY
This is nice though isn’t it

JAMES
Yes (He laughs a little
ruefully) Yes it is

James looks around at the young couples chatting each other
up at the families laughing and drinking and eating

INT THE WHITE BULL TOILET STACKPOLE QUARRY TOILET 34

Miles stares in the mirror He takes off his Rolex He puts
it down by the sink He washes his face and hands He’s
struggling again He takes a deep breath but he can’t seem
to fill his lungs He exits but leaves his Rolex watch by
the sink

As he exits the Angel-boy pushes past him into the
toilets

The door closes behind Miles

He walks on and goes to look at his watch He rushes back
in to the toilet

He goes to the sink The watch is gone He kicks open the
cubicle doors but the cubicles are empty As the last of
the doors flies open a white feather wafts into the air
Miles looks at it then exists in a hurry

CUT TO

EXT THE WHITE BULL STACKPOLE QUAY 35

James see Miles emerge searching for the Angel-Boy
frantically weaving through the crowd

Bill dances with some locals

Miles catches a glimpse of the Angel-Boy but can’t catch
up

James looks at him and sees a white feather drifting in the
wind It wafts down towards him as he reaches out for it
a hand grabs it It’s Miles He looks at the feather then
both he and James see a glimpse of the white wings heading
towards the quayside Miles follows

EXT WHITE BULL QUAYSIDE STACKPOLE QUAY 36

Eventually Miles follows him to the edge of the quayside
but the boy has vanished It doesn’t seem possible Miles
turns through 360 degrees Then he see the tops of the
wings emerging over the quayside as the boy climbs up a
mooring ladder holding a basket with a bottle in it He
looks at Miles and then sits down nonchalantly on a hay
bail and takes a swig of his sea chilled cider On the boys
wrist is a gleaming Rolex

BOY
What are you looking at

MILES
Where’d you get that watch

BOY
My father Birthday Present It’s
a Rolex Oyster Professional Sea-
Dweller 4000

MILES

Your Dad’s a liar It’s a fake
BOY

Fuck you
MILES

Nice Give it to me

BOY
I’m going to tell him you asked
to see my cock

MILES
Go on then

BOY
(wicked grin)
Do you like my wings

MILES
Give me that watch or I’1l rip
your fucking wings off and use
the blood on the stumps

BOY
(Enthralled )

What for
MILES

To write thief on the ground
BOY

I don’t want this watch

anymore I don’t like fakes
MILES

Me neither
The boy throws the watch in the water

BOY
Then we’re both better off

Miles registers this with contained exasperation Miles
turns to leave

BOY (CONT’D)
What’s up with your bumchum in
the cart

MILES
Sick

BOY
Is he your best mate

MILES
Yes

The boy swigs some cider

MILES (CONT’D)
How old are you

BOY
Nearly eleven

The boy seems bored of him all of a sudden
MILES

You may be tough but being a
‘grown up’ is shit-

BOY
Piss off If I wanted chick-flick
advice from some paedo- I’d go to

church
MILES
Youll be dead before you’re
thirty
Miles walks away
BOY

Hey poofter
Miles turns

BOY (CONTD)
What time is it

Miles instinctively looks at his watch It’s not there
The boy chuckles devilishly Miles is beaten He smiles

CUT TO

EXT BACK NEAR THE FESTIVAL STACKPOLE QUAY 37

Bill is dancing enthusiastically Miles returns and offers
the feather to James

JAMES
You keep it

Miles looks at it and tucks in his pocket Miles takes a
beer from a tray

Suddenly near to Bill two young lads start fighting A
girl screams and Bill decides to step in

BILL
Brothers This is not the way

Bill tries to wrench one lad clear but in doing so he
accidentally elbows a fat girl in the face She screams and
falls He looks at her in confusion Another guy leaps at
Bill and punches him Bill barely flinches (gentle Bill is
extremely hard) The boys know this They’ve seen this
happen before

DAVY
Hes like an Alsatian pup Hes
one of those guys that EVERYONE
just seems to love

While protesting his innocence Bill floors his assailant
He is surrounded Punches and furniture are flying from all
around Bill wrestles under a pile of angry locals

MILES
Nuts

He offers the nuts The boys watch a while longer then
Miles sighs He downs most of his pint and calmly walks
toward the fight and wades in elbowing punching and
trying to pull people off Bill

Davy tuts and shakes his head

DAVY
Back in a minute

JAMES
Davy I’m going in

DAVY
Are you drunk

JAMES
A little This is IT

DAVY
You should probably sit this out

JAMES
NO Bollocks Desperate He
realises he can’t move He looks
back at Davy) Davy ramming
speed

Davy knows this is a bad idea

JAMES (CONTD)
Please We can do this We can
BLOODY DO THIS

BEAT

Davy rolls his eyes This is a bad idea but he goes behind
the go-cart and starts pushing James towards the fight as
fast as he can As they hurtle into the fray James grabs a
stool and brandishes it in front of him He roars as he
ploughs into a group of men trying to get at Bill

Miles and Bill are doing OK until Miles accidentally
punches an old woman in the face

ANGRY LOCAL BRAWLER
What’s wrong with you bastards
Stop hittin’ the women

Miles is hit on the nose He’s blinded and flailing around
badly Davy fights beside James trying to protect himself
and James James still in the cart swings the stool
trying to hurt people in any way he can but hes soon
exhausted Someone punches him Davy is livid

DAVY
Hey Not him Hes got cancer
Im not shitting with you You
don’t hit people with cancer

A few people stop and stare Miles takes the chance to hit
someone but Davy grabs the cart and pulls James away Bill
grabs Miles and pulls him away and they join Davy and push
the cart as fast they can away from the crowd who are still
fighting each other

The boys grab their packs and the tree as they run

DAVY (CONTD)
Leave it Bill for God’s-

BILL
NO

A couple of drunken locals and the one dressed as the Bear
stagger after them but soon give up hurling abuse instead

The boys make it to the lane and away over the hill still
running

JAMES
Yes Yeees

BILL
I think we did well Sensible
retreat but the tide was
turning

BILL
Aaaah That’s good

Davy and Miles nurse themselves further Miles is drying
off and goes into his backpack for fresh clothes but they
are missing

MILES (CONT’D)

Davy goes through his pack

DAVY (CONTD)
Mine are missing too

BILL
Yes They are

Davy and Miles stare at him

BILL (CONTD)
All your SPARE clothes are

Davy is incredulous

DAVY
Why Why would you do this Why

BILL
We should be living as nature
intended us out here with as few
of the wasteful comforts as-

James winces with silent pain and takes a huge swig of
morphine syrup secretly

Bill gets out his video camera James takes the camera and
starts fooling around with it filming himself

MILES
How’s the new camera

BILL
No I didn’t get- We had a new
bathroom instead

Miles and Davy exchange glances at this

James stares down the lens then turns the camera on the
boys and the view around them

JAMES
“It seems to me my lord that the
present life of men here on earth
is as though a sparrow in the
winter time should come to a
house and very swiftly fly
through it

The camera films the nature existing around them Then he
turns it back to the boys

JAMES (CONTD)
--while you sit at dinner with
your captains and a hall made
warm with a great fire

Bill seeing that he is becoming a liTtle drowsy (but
fighting it) firmly rescues the camera from his grasp

JAMES (CONTD)
So the life of man here appears
for a little season but what
follows or what has gone before
that surely we do not know”

James swigs more Morphine

MILES
The Venerable Bead goes on to say
that seeing as it’s all unknown
we should all be Christian Live
in fear of Hell

JAMES
I forget my audience You’re
right What a gamble it is - to

The small ferry to the island is moored with its engine
running The boys approach the shed on the quayside that
serves as a ticket office Above the booth a neon sign
strangely out of place reads FERRY In the shed is a
TICKET MAN (gruff scruffy 40) who looks at the boys with
suspicion James gets out and stretches His leg is painful
and he takes the weight off it Only when the boys are
closer do they see that despite the man’s rough appearance
he is wearing heavy eye make-up

BILL
Hi there We four need to take
the ferry we and the cart
TICKET MAN

Now whenever you leave

The man leans forward and silently counts them with minimal
lip movements and nods The boys are amused

MILES

MILES
Yes
TICKET MAN

Single or return is it

BILL
Return But not today we’re
camping

TICKET MAN
Oh (This appears to change
things)

BILL

The Ticket Man looks down at his tickets
JAMES
(Quietly to Davy)

Is he wearing eye make up

DAVY
He is

TICKET MAN
All returns

MILES
Yes Does it run everyday

The ticket man looks up at Miles wearily as if this
questioning has interrupted his calculation

TICKET MAN

ferry at about 6 am last ferry
back at about 8pm No ferry
Christmas or New Years Day or
Easter

MILES
So it’s neither 365-

JAMES
It seems to say that a single
ticket is 3 quid but a return
is 650

James is pointing to a very faded notice in the window

TICKET MAN
Aye
JAMES
Well why would anyone buy a
return
TICKET MAN
For coming back
JAMES
Do you sell many return tickets
TICKET MAN
What’s your problem mate
JAMES
Uuuh

asleep in seconds as usual squeezing toothpaste on to his

James makes his way to the bow rail and looks across the

An old FERRYMAN leans on the rail nearby smoking a
cigarette James’ studies his profile

FERRYMAN

FERRYMAN
Not really But then I’m old

Does that make a difference

FERRYMAN

Aye I reckon it does

James stares at him in silence for some time

FERRYMAN (CONTD)
History does anyway By the time
I got half way through my days I
knew I was more afraid of killing
than of being killed

James thinks about this

JAMES
Yes I can see that would I’ve
had it very very easy

FERRYMAN
Not your fault

JAMES
No But I haven’t really got
started

James looks over at Miles

JAMES (CONTD)
My friend’s father died when we
were sixteen cancer He was a
writer He was amazing He was

too young but his books are
still here I haven’t achieved
anything

The Ferryman does not respond

PAUSE

JAMES (CONTD)
I’m ready though apart from
that Very little left to sort
out

FERRYMAN
Sort out Sort out eh

Yes
FERRYMAN

If I said you had a beautiful
body would you hold it against
me

JAMES
I’m sorry

FERRYMAN
Song by the Bellamy Brothers
Know it

JAMES
Oh - Yes

FERRYMAN
Did they mean hold your body
close or did they mean take
umbridge

JAMES
I - I’ve never known-

The Ferryman shakes his head gravely

FERRYMAN
But if the Bellamy Brothers got
on this ferry and they said “It
means both That’s why it’s
clever” so I finally knew
straight from the creators
mouth So bloody what Do you
know what I mean

James thinks hard

JAMES
I don’t think so

The Ferryman grins devilishly James smiles

FERRYMAN
Even when you have it all
explained by the man himself If
you can’t crack it Can’t see
really see why it’s so smart
what’s the point of being told

James raises his eyebrows at the colloquial wisdom - looks
round - hoping the others can hear they can’t

JAMES
Yes YesOk

The ferryman laughs until he chokes
JAMES (CONTD)

Have you Can you say you’ve
had a good life

The ferryman looks at him for the first time for a moment
Then he looks back at the water He is silent for some
time

much of it

pretty sure that it’s all about

barely know anything about
There’s an idea in Buddhist
faiths about a kind of constant

have proven it’s existence a
perfect timeless universal

You make a cup of tea and it
gives you real pleasure Then you
ruin it Why not finish it then
get off your arse and make a
whole new cup

James is coughing badly and it hurts Miles rolls his eyes

Davy leaps up and frantically starts to get the meds out
and starts seeing to James

JAMES
It’s fine

DAVY
Shit Are you feeling nauseous

MILES
I am but it’s the tea-making-
life metaphor

James suddenly chokes on the mixture of morphine and pot

DAVY
(In complete control)
Sit back Take the phemoryl
Youll be fine

Miles and Bill look on helplessly This is Davy’s domain
Then Bill looks away Miles looks at James and he’s
uncomfortable seeing his pain so he gets up and walks to
the edge of the cliff

CUT TO

EXT CLIFF EDGE ST GOVAN’S BEACH 53

Miles tries to take a deep breath to control his rising
anxiety He can’t He tries but he can’t breath Slowly
he manages to control it After a moment he notices that
Bill too has left James and Davy who are chatting (in the
background throughout) and he joins him

BILL
(Snapping out of his
reverie and suddenly
cheerful)
We can get to Goat’s Head
tomorrow easily It’s a great
spot Soft grass great view

MILES
(With real tenderness)
Sounds good

BILL
Miles you know a lot about
women

MILES

BILL
My life right now is I’ve been
with Abbie seven yea And
sometimes it feels- Isn’t this
what everyone feels after a
while I do love her I do

Miles looks at him

MILES
Bill we both know most people
settle for something that they
think is better than being alone

BILL
Great Is that me

MILES
What I don’t know How should I
know

BILL

Why do I want the opinion of a
man who doesn’t believe in love

MILES
(Annoyed)
The love you’re talking about is
like being an addict
(MORE )

MILES (CONTD)
You should think ‘I can’t live
without you today’ You have to
NEED that woman’s love coursing
through your veins You’d stand
in flames to make her want you
more To make her want you

Bill looks back at Miles

BILL

Mmmm - That’s not me and Abbie

MILES
Then do heroin
women anyway

It’s cheaper than

Miles smiles Bill looks at him

BILL
Someone chink the armour
MILES
No
BILL
Ok Do you always tell me the
truth
MILES
Yes
BILL

Is there real

lly such a thing as

multiple orgasms

MI
Yes

LL

Damn it

Davy comes between them He is wears a pair of surgical
gloves and a head-lamp He holds up a very large white
object like a GIANT pill (about 8cm long)

DAVY
(Gravely )
I have to get this up inside
him

He flicks on his head-lamp to illuminate the object in his
gloved hand

DAVY (CONTD)
You guys will have to hold him
down

Miles and Bill look at it then at Davy in abject horror
Suddenly Davy collapses in hysterics They hear James
dissolve too Miles and Bill sink with relief

BILL
Bastards God it’s soap
Very funny I’m going to do it
anyway Teach you gaylords a
lesson
Miles and Bill leap on Davy

FADE TO

EXT THE COAST PATH ST GOVAN’S BEACH - EARLY MORNING 55

The sun gleams on the water The boys have packed up Miles
and Davy push the cart away from where they camped They
all look a little more tired and dishevelled Miles yawns
James is putting on a good show of being fine

JAMES
See Just needed some sleep

MILES
Couldn’t breath in that tent
Bill’s feet smell more like the
wild than the wild

Bill examines the tree that is now looking a little
battered He picks it up and runs to catch up

MILES (CONTD)
And no clean underpants thanks to
the Wookie

proud and loving it but Davy looks really anxious

EXT FURTHER ALONG THE PATH STACKPOLE QUARRY 59
LATER IN THE DAY
Amongst the trees at the top of a steep cliff The boys are
tired and look at each other doubtfully as Bill starts to
climb down a rope
BILL
We can’t go round This will save
us a day that we just don’t have

A MONTAGE OF SHOTS

As the boys lower James and the cart down the cliff on the
rope

Davy and Miles edge down beside James
Suddenly the handle snaps on the cart Davy and Miles can’t

hold it James shoots down the slope on the cart Bill
braces himself as the cart hits him hard He holds it

DAVY
Jesus You OK Jim

JAMES
Fine

MILES

Nice one Bill

JAMES
Are we setting up camp soon

BILL
Yes mate

DAVY
That could have been bad

MILES
Oh Christ-

DAVY
Someone has to say it Perhaps we
can’t-

JAMES
If it’s me you’re worried about -
I’m fine

DAVY
Maybe we shouldn’t be going on
too far-

MILES

We’re not going back We’re going
to Barafundle Bay

BILL
It was a minor slip As long as
James wants to go on we go on
We gave our word and that’s all
there is

James looks up at Davy

JAMES
Every man’s reach must exceed his
graspelse what’s a heaven for

Miles and Davy start pushing the cart Davy stands there
thwarted but follows on Bill turns to James and speaks
with poetic gravity

BILL
There once was a man called Nick
Who was born with a corkscrew
dick
He spent his days in a life long
hunt To find a girl with
corkscrew-

their toll on all of them

The boys are sitting down Bill has fallen asleep again

JAMES
And you read the short stories
James and Miles look at each other trying to keep their
quizzical poker faces

MILES
I e-mailed you as you know

James looks at Miles

MILES (CONT’D)
The one about the bike-man was
great really great The one
about the nurses was bollocks

DAVY
I’m no writer but I liked them

Miles shoots a pointed look at Davy who returns it

JAMES
There’s no point pretending that
I don’t care what you think I
do more than anyone-

Davy winces at this though it’s barely perceptible

MILES
I’m not going to tell you they’re

good because -
JAMES
I’m a dying cripple
DAVY
It’s like you enjoy-
Suddenly Bill is up and on his feet

BILL

(To MILES)
Miles - is that what you really

thought

MILES
Yes

BILL
Cool James - try harder
This comes as a surprise to them all But Bill already has

his pack on and is moving on

The boys are all balanced at the top of hill and are all
balanced on the cart

DAVY
If the cart breaks-

BILL
How fucking dare you Ready for

JAMES

Take her steady Master Bates

Bill gives a push with his foot and the cart starts down
the hill slowly at first but gathering pace as the boys
ride it Bill whoops with the glory of it and even Davy
joins in the triumph But for James this speed is the
most exhilarating and his face beams with joy

CUT TO

EXT A RUBBISH FILLED COVENEAR STACKPOLE QUARRY 63

Davy Miles and James sit where the path dips close to the
level of a very narrow inlet The inlet is knee deep in
flotsam and jetsam It’s all industrial ocean rubbish
Multi-coloured plastic canisters packaging rope nets
etc As a whole this unnatural spectacle looks bizarre but
almost like an artwork Bill is down on the beach and he’s
talking to a strange figure in an old red cagoule with the
hood up and yellow waders As they watch the pair start
coming up towards them

DAVY
(Sarcastically)
Great
MILES

What do you think it is

Bill scrambles up the low cliff followed by the BEACHCOMER
He is about 40 and ruggedly handsome

BILL
Guys This is Jonathan Beaton
This is Miles Davy and that’s
James our leader

JAMES
The pleasure is ours Shall I
have Bill make some of his
excellent tea

BEACHCOMER
Thank you no I have a flask of
hot chocolate that I have to
finish I won’t have tea until
after my supper Then I may have
two mugs

There is a slight pause as the boys take in this report

BILL
This dude is amazing Show them

The Beachcomer reaches into the inside pocket of his
cagoule and takes out a tiny orange bit of plastic the size
of a toothpick There is silence The boys look at it Then
at the Beachchomer then at it Then at Bill who is
beaming then at it

BILL (CONTD)
He’s looking for - You tell them

The Beachcomer is coy as if this is going to be the Lost
Ark of the Covenant

BEACHCOMER
Darth Vaders

Silence
BILL
About a hundred thousand Darth

Vader action figures

DAVY
Star Wars toys

BILL
From 1980

MILES
(Quietly)
Are you as scared as I am

JAMES
I love where this is going

The Beachcomer sits down

BEACHCOMER
Fifteen years ago I was in a bar
in Marseilles A Chinaman
speaking french mentioned South
Pembrokeshire I was born here
so obviously I was interested
The Chinaman a cargo boat
skipper was saying he’d lost a
fortune

(MORE)

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
A container of Star Wars figures
But no ordinary Star Wars figures
-faulty Darth Vaders - made brown
like Ben Kenobi instead of
black He reckoned they’d be
collectors items one day so he
decides he’1ll (making bunny ears
in the air) “mislay” them He
leaves the docks at Milford runs
into a storm

JAMES
An ungodly tempest

BEACHCOMER
No A storm His vessel is
grounded a man dies The only
container to go over and break
up on the rocks-

DAVY
Is-

BEACHCOMER
Yes Years later I’m back here
Walking Trying to clear my head -
a lot - and I saw this cove The
wave approach and prevailing
wind make it the perfect filter
It should all be just beautiful
drift wood not this industrial
flotsam and jetsam but you
know men should still wear hats
every day the world’s changed

The boys look at him blankly

JAMES
Are you coming back to the
Chinaman

BEACHCOMER
No I realised this is where the
brown Vaders would be slowly
washing up over the years So I
started looking Every day I came
down and looked A month went by
Then two Then three nothing
I was starting to think I was
crazy-

Miles and James exchange glances

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
Then one morning spring of 2004 -

DAVY
NO

BEACHCOMER
No I found a yogurt pot inside a
sack of rubbish

The boys stare blankly again

MILES
(Under his breath)
Bagsy I die first

BEACHCOMER
It had a ‘sell by’ date on it
November 1980 Proof that there
was stuff washing up from that
exact year Obviously I kept
looking

JAMES
Obviously

BEACHCOMER
A year two years three four
and still no Brown Vaders But
I’m happily looking seeing this
beautiful view every morning
changing all the time and then
last month-

DAVY
NO

BEACHCOMER
No But I found this

He holds up the tiny orange tooth pick like a treasure

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
It’s a light saber from a Darth
Vader made between 1980 and 1981

DAVY
Wow

BEACHCOMER
Yep They’re here If I find
ten they’1ll be worth thirty five
thousand pounds The container
held more than hundred thousand
You do the math

MILES
No

James snorts trying to contain his laughter as he gets up
Davy jumps to help him

DAVY
I never heard anything like it in
my whole life

JAMES
You speak for us all I needa
piss

MILES

No Let me I’m dying to see his
cock it’s been ages

Miles follows James but doesn’t touch him Davy looks
irked that his job has been taken

BILL
I’m going down there

Bill leaps off the edge down to the cove
NEARBY
As Miles and Jim approach a suitable spot to pee at
MILES
(Whispering )
Captain we may have to sacrifice
Nurse Davy to save ourselves

BACK

Davy is examining the light-saber The Beachcomer is
oblivious to the mirth he has caused

BEACHCOMER
Your friend is ill

DAVY
Just excitable

BEACHCOMER
No the other one Ja-

DAVY
I know I was joking Yes James
He’s got cancer Terminal

Davy looks over at James and Miles
BEACHCOMER
Right I lost a friend to cancer

My best friend ever

DAVY
Sorry

BEACHCOMER
It’s not your fault It’s just
really really really really
really really really unlucky

DAVY
(Wondering at his
madness)

Right

BEACHCOMER
I have other friends People find
me attractive But I started
looking for a replacement for my
dead friend Among my existing
friends then acquaintances and
then new people

LONG PAUSE

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
Why didn’t you want the laughing-
one to take your sick-friend to
urinate

DAVY
I - I didn’t mind

BEACHCOMER
(Considering Davy)
Right

DAVY
How long will you keep looking

BEACHCOMER
For a friend I don’t anymore
That’s the point

DAVY
No for the (He gestures to
the beach)

BEACHCOMER

(Looking over to see

what Davy’s pointing

at)
Oh that I took millions of
photos of it all That’s what I
used to do you see Fashion
though I put the photos ina
book with some thoughts about
stuff rubbish mostly Ha And my
agent in New York sold it and it
sold a lot a lot I mean A
LOT So I’m OK I’m more OK
than ever In fact I

Long silence

The Beachcomer seems to have realised that this is true for
the first time in a long long while He and Davy look at
each other Davy smiles at him

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
Four years Haven’t had to give a
shit about anyone Great to be
needed isn’t it I’d forgotten

Davy nods

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
Do you ever find yourself
really really really annoying

DAVY
Yes

BEACHCOMER
Me too

They both laugh

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
Whose going to be your friend
when he’s gone

DAVY
I haven’t really thought about
it

BEACHCOMER
You should Wow NO You
shouldn’t Maybe you’re one of
the lucky ones David
Satisfiable How would that be
Rare A gift There already And
good Well done

Davy is totally bowled over considering this idea James
and Miles are back

There is a silence
BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
Sometimes I suddenly see things
Like when I take a picture It’s
perfect Right thereClick
The boys watch him

In the background we notice Bill tearing around the cove
flinging rubbish about

Suddenly the Beachcomer gets up picks up his bag

BEACHCOMER (CONTD)
Well - this was a life changing
few minutes James we would have
been good friends Not best
friends but good friends (He
looks at Miles briefly but says
nothing Then to Davy) You I’m
not sure Good and possibly best
Yes

DAVY
(Surprised )
Thank you I - thank you

BEACHCOMER
No Thank you

Bill clambers up from the beach The boys watch him go in
bemused silence

BILL
Good luck mate Maybe I could
come back sometime and help-

BEACHCOMER
Nah I’m done with all that shit
(He tosses the light sabre into
the cove) Enjoy your walk

He strides off on a new mission

BILL
I LOVE that dude

DAVY
He was quite I don’t know he
was actually-

MILES
I really thought he was going to
kill us

Davy helps James onto the cart while watching the
Beachcomer

JAMES
Possibly fuck us and eat us

MILES
(Getting his pack on)
He could turn round of course
Stalk us until we settle down to
sleep

He gives a final wave and disappears but Davy keeps
watching The others look at each other

JAMES
David Did that man try to touch
your private place

CUT TO

EXT FOURTH NIGHT CAMP TBC - EVENING 64

A delve on the cliffs beside a small rocky bay The camp
looks very inviting Two tents have lanterns and the boys
drink beers round the fire

Miles and Bill setup fishing rods and lanterns on tripods
in slapstick fashion in the background

James takes some more morphine secretly while Davy’s back
is turned Davy is checking his mobile phone secretly Davy
hurriedly re-packs it Then Davy turns and sees James

DAVY
You been hitting the morphine
kind of hard

James looks at him They both know he needed to Davy
feigns a smile and takes out the silver medication bag to
do the other meds

James takes this chance to reach into Davy’s pack and steal
his mobile and put it in his own on the cart

Bill and Miles return to the fireside Miles starts blowing
up the Pink Lilo mattress

BILL
We’ve done well We could take it
easy and do another night
Miles rolls over exhausted already
MILES
No I have to be in work on
Tuesday whatever

James looks pissed off at this Davy does too
Bill lies down beside it and starts blowing
DAVY
I still think we’re carrying too

much

Bill reaches out to the tree and hugs it to him

DAVY (CONTD)
The fireworks

JAMES
Fireworks

BILL
Davy

JAMES

What fireworks

BILL
Youve ruined it

DAVY
Sorry sorry But-—

James is confused

BILL
We had this idea that because
you love the stars and having
heard the whole ‘dancing through
cosmos’ thing it seems doubly
apt that we try and give them
to you

JAMES
Ha

MILES

But they weigh a ton so let’s
just light the fuckers

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FOURTH NIGHT CAMP TBC - LATER

The sky is lit by an amazing shower of white cascading
fireworks

Miles and Bill set them off some way from the camp on the
rocky cove They are unsure of what they are doing

At the camp we see James wrapped in blankets beside Davy
They watch with wonder

DAVY
Am I annoying you

JAMES
Sometimes

DAVY
(Sad and guilty)
Sorry

A firework explodes at the wrong angle Bill and Miles
shriek and dive out of it’s path

James and Davy duck as it shoots over them and straight
into one of the tents The nylon tent bursts into flame

As Miles and Bill arrive the tent has already evaporated
the kit inside is well alight as the firework continues to
explode impressively Davy grabs a small bottle of water
and jumps about in panic splashing it onto the flames

DAVY (CONTD)
THATS FUCKING GREAT WHAT DO WE
DO NOW YOU FUCKING IDIOT YOU
IDIOT

MILES
It was him as well

Bill soaks a towel and dampens the fireand they manage
to stamp out the rest

Most of the stuff inside has been burned including their
rucksacks James has all but passed out from laughing and
the pain it causes him Davy Bill and Miles stare the
wreckage exhausted and shocked There is silence

James is on the ground on his front staring at ocean
Tears well in his eyes He grips clumps of the dew laden
grass It is hard to tell if this is in pain or rage But
the feeling passes he stares fixedly at the sea Then
slowly he rolls over and sits up

A movement behind him Miles is next to wake He sees
James and there is a moment where says nothing Evaluating
awkward

something else

Davy looks over the damaged kit James watches them Davy
finds some condoms

DAVY

JAMES

not come up but - thanks Bill

I’m glad you see it that way I
don’t

I’m grateful But what ARE you
going to do when I’m gone I
can’t picture it

DAVY

about being taken advantage of at
work until you lost your job

at just at the right time

Ill pay for all three of you to
see a shrink when we get home
But for now-

finding your

And you are being a bit-

It’s not what life’s dealt you
it’s the cards you feel safe

playing
Davy is silent His face is dead

James looks at him then at Davy then at Miles Drugs and
pain wrack his body and his face has darkened to a storm

take the piss but I’m angry

anger)
Well you shouldn’t be

Miles kicks himself for losing his temper even briefly as
this will egg James on

JAMES (CONTD)
I don’t want to die

They are sobered

time I’d take any one of your
pointless consumer-fucker lives

going to be special I know it
sounds pompous It is

MILES
Don’t I love my life Cancer’s
no excuse for being such an
egomaniac Why are you special

JAMES
You don’t think I would have-
(become a writer)

MILES
I don’t know That’s the point
By our age my father had written
three novels already

writing’s good but you only sat
down to finally do it because it
got too difficult to stand up

MILES
You bore the fuck out of me

DAVY
Why are you so cruel Just cruel
There’s other ways to get what
you want

MILES
(Nodding )
It’s like you’re actually looking
at my soul through a microscope
(It becomes obvious he is taking
the piss) I have to find a way
to redeem myself Davy will you

Davy just stares at him No one laughs

MILES (CONTD)
Bill Rabies

Bill wants to laugh but James and Davy are still stony-
faced Miles shakes his head and backs away exasperated

MILES (CONTD)
God GOD

He gets up kicks a bottle of beer into the darkness

MILES (CONTD)
We don’t NEED to do this We
don’t

Miles looks at James almost pleadingly

JAMES

for the others to hear) He
finished it years ago

James approaches with a lantern He is in pain Miles
glances round He really doesn’t want to help TO TOUCH HIM
EVEN so James lowers himself onto the sand

JAMES
So I read your book Your lie
can’t exist

MILES
When did you read it

JAMES
Two years ago I snooped on your
computer It seemed a natural
part of the competition we’d been
having all our lives I found
three drafts of the finished
book I copied the latest I
felt guilty and jealous So I put
it away And I hated you for it
Then I got ill And I gave in to
my desire to Even though I
knew you’d never ever forgive
me

MILES
I wont

JAMES
It ruined me You’re right Out
of the two of us you should-
(write )

MILES
I don’t give a shit what you
think of my book I really don’t

That book means a lot to me-
JAMES

Because-
MILES

Oh Shut up Come on Youre
going to tell me why it means a
lot to me now Jesus this trip
has been like a walk with the
sick-white-Oprah And you would
hate you right now

JAMES
Miles-—

MILES
Mate if you really need to tell
me something you could have
phoned me and I’d have come over
We would have had a chat and then
we would have watched Jaws and
pretended you weren’t sick-

JAMES
I am

MILES
Because you are And when you’re
gone when you’re gone you won’t
know how I So all this is just
unnecessary fake soul searching
that EVERYONE fucking does these
days

James tries to speak but Miles is off

MILES (CONTD)
I can’t even say this REAL stuff
because I just may not get to see
you again so I can-

JAMES
You don’t have to apologise-

MILES
I wasn’t going to apologise you
arrogant little fucker I’m
right

(MORE )

MILES (CONTD)
And we never apologise I can
say this shit and see you in
five minutes and say nothing
That’s the point There is one
human one other human being in
this whole world to who we can
say anything Anything Anything

The radio is playing They pack up their kit There’s still
a lingering tension between Davy and Miles They side step
each other as they pack away No one has slept well They
look like insects unfurling in the sun
Miles is struggling to open a broken tin of tuna
MILES

Shit it Shitting thingI need-

Jim have you got that knife
James tosses the old penknife from Davy at him
He opens it and tries to pry open the can

The blades snaps

He freezes He looks up They have all seen James looks
simply saddened by it - but Davy is livid Silent but

livid
MILES (CONT’D)

Davy cleans the cooking pots they still have James rest
near by In the distance Miles chatting with Bill

JAMES

DAVY

JAMES

What do you really think about

Beat James is sipping secretly at his morphine

DAVY
Youve no right to talk to me

JAMES
Why didn’t you say that in front
of them

DAVY
(Coldly )

CUT TO

EXT SECOND NIGHT CAMP BROAD HAVEN 75

The cart is loaded Miles holds it to stop it rolling down
the slope Bill and Davy bring stuff to put on it Suddenly
a phone rings It’s Miles’ mobile

JAMES
(Annoyed)
You promised

MILES
It’s work I need to take this
call It’s a very important
situation

BILL
More important than this trip

MILES
Davy has a phone too

DAVY
For emergencies It’s not about
the phone It’s about you not
really wanting to be here

Davy snatches Miles’ phone which is still ringing stops
the call and sticks it in his pocket defiantly

MILES
Give me that phone

The cart that Miles was holding is now trundling towards
the cliff edge behind them James sees it and shouts at
them They panic Davy runs after it Bill does too and
falls over in hilarious fashion But Davy runs towards the
edge He’s almost at the cart as the cart reaches the
brink The cart sails over the edge Miles is close behind
and dives to catch Davy who would have gone over the cliff
with the cart and pulls him back

DAVY
What are you doing

MILES
You would have gone over with it

DAVY
I would have got it you twat

JAMES
He just saved your life

BEAT

MILES
You think he likes me more than
you you whiny poof

Davy takes Miles’ mobile from his pocket and throws it over
the cliff in rage

Miles watches in disbelief
Davy tries to look as though he doesn’t regret it

MILES (CONTD)
Why do people keep throwing my
stuff in the sea

Then he turns calmly to look at Davy Bill steps in

BILL
OK That ALSO was and accident
We can’t afford many more The
phone That was bad Bad Davy
But it’s not the end of the
world Miles your work knows
you’ve gone into the wild-

MILES
It’s not that fucking simple
It’s all fucked Things are bad
People rely on me The bank have
called in our loan I’m going
under (To Davy) Miles is
failing You happy about that

James looks down over the cliff again

JAMES
Boys we have a problem

CUT TO

EXT CLIFF TOP BROAD HAVEN OR STACKPOLE CLIFFS 76

All the boys lie on the edge peering down at the cart
which rests broken on the rocks below Miles rolls over
onto his back and stares at the sky James looks seriously
ill

DAVY
We’ll call Mr G Maybe they’11
send a helicopter

JAMES
NO No way We haven’t finished
the walk

DAVY

Mate you weren’t doing that much
walking and your transport is
gone

DAVY (CONTD)

We’1ll call your dad Maybe stay
at a B and B on the mainland and he
could find -

BILL
Where’s your phone

DAVY
In my bag

JAMES
Uh No I’m afraid it’s in my
bag on the cart

There is a pause where they all compute this new problem
They look over the edge

DAVY
This is un-fucking-believeable

BILL
There’s a kind of amazing natural
symmetry-

DAVY

Shut up Bill

BILL
We’ve still got the tent We’11
just have to camp here while one
of us goes back and gets help-

JAMES
(Lost in thought
Quietly)
No

DAVY
Where’s the map

MILES
In the cart

JAMES
We’re going on It’s not far
I’1l walk it I can

DAVY
James-—

JAMES
No Davy I have to go on I just
want one night there If you
won’t come I’1l go without you I
have to I have to I’m not
finished

He clambers to his feet and feebly heads off with fierce
determination despite being a shadow of the man that
started the trip

There is a moment of silent debate They watch his tragic
determined figure hobbling away Davy looks at Bill

BILL
We may be closer to the emergency
phone at Barafundle- So I
could go back to the last phone
Reckon I can jog it in five hours

maybe

MILES
When did you last run for five
hours

DAVY

If we go on we should stick
together in case we have to carry
him

Davy glances at Miles but won’t ask him

BILL
What do you think Miles

Miles is concerned but he looks at James

MILES
Thanks to you pricks I doubt
Ill have a company to go back to
now
They all look at James hobbling as fast as he can

DAVY
Is it time to leave the tree-

BILL
(Abrupt )
The tree is one of us
Davy rolls his eyes
BILL (CONTD)
So should I tell him or let him
keep going
Davy shakes his head

BILL (CONT’D)
James Stop

JAMES
Are you coming to Barafundle

BILL
We are But it’s that way

He points in the opposite direction

FADE TO

Leaning on a stick and on Davy James sets off gingerly

Miles lingers behind and struggles to take a breath again
He closes his eyes calms down

James looks ahead in agony

CUT TO

78 EXT COAST PATH BB NORTH 78

James leans on Bill but the pain is quite bad and fatigue
consumes him Though it is awkward on Bills part and James
knows it They silently change from James leaning as he
walks to leaning in more heavily Bill takes more of his
weight having to put his arm round his waist to James
putting both arms round Bill’s neck and eventually they
come to a stop and Bill has to put down the tree

He offers his back James clambers on without an ounce of
energy to spare Bill looks at the tree sadly Davy hurries
his step and picks up the tree Bill smiles at him They
walk on

CUT TO

EXT THE COAST PATH BB NORTH 79

Exhausted they have stopped for a break Bill has fallen
asleep with his back to the other three Davy examines the
gas can of the stove

DAVY
Is this the only gas we have
Bill

MILES
Asleep

JAMES

(Pain and drug addled)
Good to see him off the leash
isn’t it Sooner he ditches that
bitch the better

MILES
How do you know that’s what he
wants

JAMES

He’s a big hearted hilarious
force of nature And she crushes
every natural urge he has It’s a
horrible relationship He has to
face it

MILES
It’s none of our business He’s
blissfully unhappy in his
relationship probably going
through the ups and downs like
everyone else

James takes another swig of his Syrup

JAMES
People who are totally in love
have arguments that burst the
bubble only to facilitate the
bubble’s exquisite re-inflation

Miles rolls his eyes Bill slowly rolls over and gets up
looking crestfallen

BILL
“Facilitate the bubble’s
exquisite re-inflation” Hmm Not
me and Abbie

Awkward silence There is a silence that is finally broken
by James

JAMES
Thank God Bill make a clean
break

MILES

Be vile and distant ‘til she
cheats on you Then dump her

JAMES
This is a new start-

BILL
Abbie’s pregnant

There is a dreadful silence
James is particularly filled with horror and confusion
This was not in his plan

Bill looks darkly at the ground

JAMES

Why didn’t you say
BILL

I wanted to enjoy the walk
JAMES

Congrat-
BILL

Don’t

Pause

DAVY

I’m not saying it’s good news in
the circumstances but youll be
a brill-

MILES
Definitely yours

Bill is aghast at this but thinks about it

BILL
Far as I know

MILES
And she wants to keep it

Bill nods Miles nods back

DAVY
Baby or not if she isn’t the
one-
BILL
Of course she isn’t the one
JAMES
Well then grasp- (the life YOU
want)
BILL
(Angry)
It’s not that simple
JAMES
But-
BILL

(ANGRY ANGRY ANGRY )
Shut the fuck up Jim Yeah it
all gets “watered down” It does
With every year But I know that
what I do with my life effects
other people I stick to my
decisions - however shit - I’m
trying I may not set the world
on fire but I see things
through And when all my dreams
come to nothing I’1ll be around
to bloody see it

Beat

BILL (CONTD)
(To Jamesthen Miles and
Davy )
You should have told me before
You should have fucking told me

Bill backs away from them shaking with rage

He stumbles over the tree He grabs it He brandishes it
above his head like a mace and pounds it on the ground
Then picks it up and does it again Now he swings it round
twice and sends it flying over the cliff He watches it
disappear

The boys just stare at him

Bill’s rage subsides He slumps to his knees on the cliff
edge totally spent looking at the sea

The boys look at each other Eventually Miles walks over
to Bill and stands facing the sea but very close to him

MILES
Well You really showed that
tree

Bill laughs The tension is released and he leans against
Miles’ leg Miles roughs his hair as though patting a much
loved old dog that has just failed to catch a rabbit Bill
turns around and looks at James

BILL
I’m sorry

James looks at him with sympathy and shakes his head

he’s speechless he tries to reamin serious but cracks
up

CUT TO
EXT COAST PATH BB NORTH 80

The boys are tired and struggling Davy and Bill carries
heavy packs Davy carries James on his back

They have stopped to rest James is suffering Bill sits a
little apart and nurses serious blisters but without
dressings for them he just pulls his boot on in agony They
all look at each other They all know going a step further
may be beyond them all

James tries to walk on He looks out at the sea He watches
a cormorant that is hovering at his eye-line dive into the
sea He looks at the birds and smiles

BILL
I’m sorry about your tree I’m
going to grow another We can-

JAMES
Do you know what I wouldn’t have
it any other way My tree will
drift wash up on some strange
shore perfect
Bill smiles

No one is talking Each in his own private miserable world
they concentrate on nothing but moving forward

Miles is ahead looking scared Behind him Davy is carrying
an exhausted James

Bill is at the rear carrying Davy’s pack Even he is just
trudging on step by step now limping badly but trudging on
with gritted teeth Unnoticed by Bill Davy’s pack which
has a hole burnt in it from the fire starts to tear apart
as he walks and pieces of kit drop out

Pull out to show the great distance of wilderness ahead

CUT TO

EXT THE COAST PATH MARTIN’S HAVEN OR BROAD HAVEN 81
They get to a steep rise and stand at the bottom

James is on Bill’s back

He adjust his hold on James and starts to climb

Bill stumbles Davy and Miles leap forward to try and catch
James and Bill but too late and Bill falls His efforts to
protect James cause him to fall badly and James cries out
in pain Bill and Miles just look at him Helpless but
Davy grips James hand

DAVY
Youre alright Breath in

James is pulling on Davy’s hair
Miles is appalled

MILES
Right Are we done I mean I
think we’re done now Fuck it
I’11 run back Bill runs on or
vice versa One of us will get
there We might see a boat or-

DAVY
Shut up Miles We’1ll be fine

James focuses on Davy’s eyes He smiles as much as he can
manage

MILES
Bill This is fucking mental

Bill looks at Davy

BILL
I don’t know

MILES
Jesus

DAVY
(to Miles)
You carry Jim for a bit

Miles looks scared He looks at James who is paler than
ever Miles looks up the steep incline ahead and back at
Davy

MILES

Don’t tell me what to do-
DAVY

Why
MILES

You feeling all hard now Why
Because I didn’t kick your arse
for chucking my phone away or
because I’m -

DAVY
Oh- just shut it This isn’t
about you right now Pick him up

MILES
No

DAVY
Pick him up

MILES
Fuck you

DAVY

Pick him up you fucking coward

Miles swings at him and lands a punch on the top of Davy’s
head which hurts his hand

Davy swings back and soon they are rolling on the floor
trying to kill each other

Bill watches shaking his head James turns from the cliff
edge to look at them Miles and Davy fight with neither
obviously winning

JAMES
We should stop them
BILL
Well I know we should but

it’s kind of fascinating

Davy and Miles both give up at the same time totally
exhausted They fall back

BILL (CONTD)
Let’s call it a draw (To
Miles) I liked the little ‘EEEK’
noise you made when he got you in
a head lock

Miles looks at him and then can’t help laughing Neither
can Davy

There is a silence

DAVY
We’re men now And it turns out
I’m a pretty fucking average man
And you know what - Heaven forbid
that I should learn anything on
this fucking trip But I have
I’ve got people who love me
People I love back This is all
there is and it hurts and it’s
amazing But it’s the truth But
I’m not afraid of it and THAT
is what makes you despise me

Miles is beaten Davy stares at him waiting for the attack
but sensing victory

MILES
It is easier winding you up than
being You

Miles and Davy grip hands in conciliation

BILL
This trip is awesome

MILES

(Weakened beyond

recognition Looks to

James)
Your illness disgusts me If I
got sick like that I’d be so
totally humiliated It shocks me
That’s ALSO the truth After my
Dad- I actually don’t need to say
this I don’t have to But I am -
SO sorry

He looks at Davy too Then he gets up and goes over to
James and starts to heave him up and onto his back

MILES (CONT’D)
Come on you bugger

He starts to climb the massive incline

It’s tough this is a huge challenge it’s painful for
James and Miles is struggling to climb at all

CLOSE in on Miles and James They are silent Both in pain
of different kinds

PAUSE Gradually the action slows to slow motion We hear
two different heart beats One stronger than the other

Finally with Bill and Davy supporting Miles and James
they reach the summit and collapse again

From the summit of the hill they see Barafundle Bay

The sun kisses the water at a million glistening lips

They stare at the cove for a moment taking it in

BILL

DAVY
Told you we’d make it

They laugh

BILL
I‘d forgotten how incredible

Still a little wet from the swim they have started to set
up camp and Bill has a fire going They are happy But
across the laughter James and Miles make eye contact There
is the hint of suspicion in both their eyes James raises
his morphine syrup in a toast to him

Miles nods

The laughter continues and their eyes are diverted by the
chatter

JAMES
Bill Whatever the
circumstances any child will
be so lucky-

Bill nods

JAMES (CONTD)
Bill any names picked out

BILL
Couple But not really

JAMES
How about Larch

Davy and Miles try to stay straight faced Bill thinks
about this

BILL
I quite like that

James smiles Davy and Miles at each other with silent
horror

James is resting The other three have gathered driftwood
to make shelters around the fire tying them with bits of
rope from the flotsam and jetsam As they work

DAVY
Waste of money Hated going to
the gym anyway Full of Russian
gangsters-—

MILES
You haven’t spent all your
redundancy already have you

DAVY
No-

MILES
Only It’s tough out there at the
moment—

DAVY

No I don’t need-

MILES
I could have helped but now-

DAVY
It’s fine But thank-

MILES
Do you have a little nest egg to-

MILES (CONT’D)
‘Course you should put into
property But-—

DAVY
Maybe I can get my old job-

MILES
Well like I say if I can throw
something your-

BILL
Wait Davy ‘get your old job
back’ I thought you were made
redundant You can’t

Miles realises what Davy has said and both he and Bill look
at him

DAVY
Yeah I um

BILL
You quit for this didn’t you

Davy doesn’t answer They are silenced

Eventually Bill slaps him on the back and keeps working on
the driftwood shelter

So does Miles But as he works

MILES
Youre a class act Davy A class
act

With only a sideways glance to each other they on with
their jobs but this has meant the world to Davy

shadows in the flickering firelight

They are sorting out their breakfast things

BILL
Is there anything so restful as
the sound of the ocean

Only Miles looks away He looks unhappy

JAMES
Fuck Sorry guys I was so proud
of myself for my stoicism I
thought I could wrap everything
up neatly and then-

MILES
I’m fucking your sister

James just stares at him Miles stares with a strange look
of calm danger in his eyes that antagonises and inspires

James nods slowly and looks to the sea This is not what
Miles expects He looks to a stunned Bill and Davy

Eventually James looks back at him impassively

MILES (CONT’D)
I am totally and utterly in love
with her and I have been for ten
years

JAMES
(Genuinely surprised
now )

Shit

MILES
I watched her marry Mike and did
nothing Have children settle
down in her big comfortable

life Only then did I really
know I had to find I pursued
her And I got her

JAMES
My God

MILES
We met up when you got sick and -
well Ironic isn’t Terribly
ironic

JAMES
Yes

MILES

I’m going to buy a big house and
one day soon she’1l leave Mike
Then sometime after she’1l
bring the girls to my houseand
she’1l be mine

Beat
JAMES

I always knew she had a thing for
you but most women seem to-

MILES
NO No I wanted her She would
never have I wanted her So I

took her And we are perfect for
each other Perfect in every way
Perfect Perfect

JAMES
Jesus I mean itll

James Davy and Bill stare at Miles mentally envisaging all
the stress and turmoil this will cause to all involved
after James is gone Miles just stares back at James

JAMES (CONTD)
When were you going to tell me-
Oh You weren’t

MILES

JAMES
So do you want my blessing

MILES
No I’ll do it anyway
PAUSE
JAMES
Yep
MILES
Yep

They sit in silence

MILES (CONTD)
My father always told me that one
thing is bigger and better and
stronger than everything and
everyone in this world put
together I’d ask him what it was
and he would never tell me He
said I’d find out if I were any
son of his I

JAMES
I do so hope it turns out well

Silence

BILL
So do I

Miles looks at Davy who stares at the fire
DAVY
It makes sense Wierdly it makes
sense
Miles is surprised by Davy’s gravity Humbled

They sit in silence for a while again

CUT TO

They have fashioned a driftwood shelter out of bill’s
sculptures

MILES
I know what you wanted

JAMES
There is no ribbon to tie around
it all is there

He looks at Miles who just stares at him

JAMES (CONTD)
I thought I was ready Now I
look at Bill and wonder if I
could just get through another
nine months And if I could hold
on until Chloe is sorted with or
without

James stares at the sea He nods slowly
JAMES (CONTD)
I’m leaving early And it all

goes on without me

MILES
I’m so sorry

James whips round to look at him
JAMES
Strange thing is - this is what I
was most afraid of But now it’s
a relief Milo It’s such a
bloody relief
Miles nods James struggles to get up Miles helps him

EVENING

James is stoking the fire but staring at the sea Davy has
a John Grisham paperback Half of it is burnt

DAVY
I think it’s more interesting
with half the page missing

JAMES
I’m going to go for a swim

Davy and Bill look at him but Miles’ head drops

DAVY
Your mum said you-

JAMES
I know Tomorrow I’m going to
swim out into the bay and I’m
not coming back I know the
enormity of this but I’m asking
you to let me swim
Bill and Davy stare at him in horrified silence Miles’
head sinks further and he stares at the sand

DAVY
No
BILL
Jim we just can’t do that Why-
JAMES
You can The question is will
you
BILL
Has this been your plan all
along

James nods

BILL (CONTD)
I thought you wanted to live Why-

JAMES

(Gesturing to himself

and the effect the walk

has had)
Because this is what my life is
going be like Because of the
pain and the drugs I take for
the pain and the drugs I take
for the side-effects of the other
drugsYou’ve seen it And it’s
only going to get worse Life is
all up here really but it takes
over Gradually I’1l1 slip further
into thinking solely about pain
And that’s not worth living for

BILL
I don’t know what the pain’s like
but surely we can

JAMES
What

BILL
I don’t know I just We can’t
let you swim mate

JAMES
Stop saying you CAN’T You can
But you wont

James looks at Miles - silently calmly watching
BILL
What would we say to your mum and
dad-

DAVY
This is crazy I can’t even
believe you’re talking about it
normally

JAMES
The same as you’d say to the
police That when you woke up I’d
gone You checked the dunes and
then you saw something floating
in the water That you came to
get me but it was too late
(Beat) One of you had run up to
the headland to the emergency
phone You wouldn’t be alone for
long

BILL
But every time I looked at your
family I’d know they could have
had you for another day Said
goodbye properly

JAMES
That’s just it there won’t be a
better goodbye than the one we
had

DAVY
There will It’s not time yet

JAMES
I’ve never been so alive And now
I want to end it to actually
finish something

BILL
Why don’t you just go home and
take an overdose like normal
people

James laughs

BILL (CONTD)
It’d be painless You’d just fall
asleep

JAMES
I’d be quitting If I swim out
and the sea takes me it’s
different I’d be making the
choice

(MORE)

JAMES (CONTD)
I want to be conscious until I’m
gone I want to feel something
even if it’s the pain of salt
water in my lungs I want to
feel the fight Something huge
and terrifying and brave

DAVY
I promised your mum I’d bring you
back

BILL

Sorry James
Heartbroken James looks at Miles
Miles shakes his head

JAMES
OK OK It was too much to ask

He lies back and closes his eyes

Inter-cut with the coast path where the torch light beams

getting louder and louder as they approach

Davy rips the Med’ bag open and takes out a bottle of syrup
and helps James to drink it It quickly starts to take
effect as Davy takes a morphine ‘patch’ and sticks it on

breathing slows a little a quiet descends Bill and
Miles collapse by the fire with relief but don’t talk By
firelight we see they have been traumatised

stands his arms supporting James wrapped in a sleeping

soft puffing as they break the surface of the still water
to breath The boys look at each other and smile but say
nothing

for a while Davy notices their look Miles nods at Bill
slowly then looks back at the sea Bill looks at Davy then
back at the fire

James is now at the shoreline sitting alone wrapped in
his sleeping bag The sparkling sea laps at the shore The
boys watch him James gets slowly up and turns to look at
them He smiles

Bill beams but a tear rolls down his cheek James laughs
warmly

BILL

together They look young and scared

MILES
Go on if you’re going

James’ fear is gone suddenly He smiles and turns to the
sea He walks in gingerly it’s cold he is breathing hard

JAMES
You could catch your death in
here

He goes in and swims a bit in the shallows The cold takes
his breath He laughs On the beach the boys look on in
horror Davy cries shaking his head

James looks at them then he turns around and starts to
slowly swim out He looks back once more and then swims on

Miles takes off his shoes and checks his pockets He takes
out some coins and with them the white feather He looks at
and tosses it away Then he strides in to the water

Bill follows and lastly Davy though he’s not sure if this
is a rescue or not It’s not

Miles catches up with James and swims near him Bill is on
the other side Davy the weakest swimmer is behind James
looks at them glad they are there They swim in silence

Davy is upset and accidentally swallows water and chokes
Suddenly he’s struggling Bill Miles and James look at
each other there is something absurd about this But
Davy is in real difficulty and panics as he starts to go
under coughing and spluttering Bill goes to his rescue
Bill struggles to hold him and takes him back to the beach
James and Miles watch the rescue with bewilderment
MILES
Fuck You nearly out-lived Davy

James laughs and then gets a spasm of pain and he can’t
stay afloat Miles drags James towards him

James’ nerve recovers and he pushes himself free James
treads water They stare at each other for a few moments

ON THE BEACH

Davy tries to run into the water again but Bill holds him
back Davy struggles to get away but Bill holds him firmly
Davy collapses on the sand They watch helplessly

IN THE WATER

James is exhausted He struggles then lets himself go
under Miles is unsure what to do He looks to the shore
and sees Bill and Davy Then he looks at the bubbles
rising Silence Suddenly James bursts from the still
surface gasping reaching for Miles Miles holds him
They stare at each other for a moment then they laugh

But the laughter fades

MILES (CONT’D)
You’ve ruined this camping trip
Can we go home now

James shakes his head sadly

JAMES
Sorry If you can’t do it Tell
me I’ll swim as far as I can
I’d rather not be alone mate

MILES
Jim Jesus Christ Jim I act
like I’m special but it’s
fake Jamie It’s fake I’m
scared Of everything There’s no
one to look after me

JAMES
I think Miles David Hector
Clavell you are one of the
great men The stuff of heroes
runs through your veins I
doubt you will escape it

Miles can hardly breath James stares at him and realises
that he can’t do it And the disappointment is crushing

JAMES (CONTD)
Please Miles Do this this
dreadful wonderful thing for me
Tears run down James face James takes a deep breath He’s
shaking and he can’t stay afloat

JAMES (CONTD)
Miles

Miles holds him They stare at each other This is the end
James is weak and beaten and tired He looks around at Bill
and Davy He looks at the sea and the sky and smiles
he looks relieved

JAMES (CONTD)
It’s all so

He looks at Miles Miles still stares at him he is
petrified James sees it They keep fierce eye contact

JAMES (CONTD)
(Whispering )
We are the maker’s of dreams
and this little life

MILES
That was the last thing my father
said-

JAMES

I know I read your book

Miles nods almost imperceptibly Miles holds him by the
shoulders and they stare at each other

JAMES (CONTD)
God speed

James allows himself to sink under the water
Miles can hardly breath He stares down

James stares up at him Now Miles sinks with him
He holds James under

James breath runs out and he starts an involuntary
convulsion His face shows the fear and panic and he grabs
at Miles’ face fighting to save himself - to swim to the
surface - but Miles holds him under Miles fights himself
with all his will-power to hold him down His own breath is
running out The urge to lift James from the water is
unbearable Their eyes never leave each other Miles can’t
hold on much longer Then suddenly James goes limp Hes
still alive - staring Miles has no need to hold him down
now The water has filled James’ lungs The bubbles of air
have gone He sinks There is stillness James sees the
blue sky behind Miles the sun light flickering on the
surface of the sea behind Miles making him seem to glow

FINALLY - Miles kicks to the surface Alone

He takes great gasps of air His lungs finally fill He is
breathing He is alive

James is still under the surface Miles stares into his
face James is dead

Miles drags James’ body towards the shore Waist deep in
the water he stands there He doesn’t move for a few
moments unable to believe that James is really gone He
tries to carry the body but he falls

Davy rushes into the water first to Miles and hugs him
He looks him in the eyes and hugs him again

Then he looks at James and reaches under the water to touch
him Davy Bill and Miles drag James from the water and on
to the beach

Bill shaking looks between Davy and Miles Miles is lost
in his own world He slumps down staring at the sea too

Davy stares down at James and reaches out to touch his hair
but suddenly he stops

DAVY
He’s gone This isn’t him

Davy arranges James body into a more ‘comfortable
position’

He goes to the tent and gets a large towel and drapes it
around Miles’ shoulders It is brilliantly white in the
morning sun

Davy looks at Bill and Miles and then at James Then he
runs away towards the steps up from the beach

CUT TO

EXT JAMES HOUSE GILTAR GROVE 95

A police man and a policewoman walk towards the house
Chloe crosses the garden from the orchard with a bucket of
apples She sees them She drops the apples She stands
motionless for a few seconds then she starts to pick up the
apples quite calmly She stops looks at the sky then
carries on picking up the apples

CUT TO

INT JAMES HOUSE GILTAR GROVE 96

The party scene as at the beginning Slow motion James is
bending down towards the candles His happy face
illuminated by their flame of 29 candles

JAMES (VO)
I’‘1ll raise a morphine syrup to
you later while I’m selling your
presents on e-bay And if over
the years you should happen to
notice that it’s the anniversary
of my birth remember that you
were loved by me and that you
made my life a happy one and
there is no tragedy in that

He takes a huge breath and blows out the candles

CUT TO

EXT BARAFUNDLE BAY 97
Davy comes running down the beach out of breath but
focussed The other two don’t look at him He looks at his
watch He sits on the beach beside Miles

They look at all the sky At all the sparkling water

Amidst the black a firmament of twinkling stars appears

JAMES (V0O)
Listen the thing about life
is What (HE GIGGLES AGAIN)
Oh bollocks We’ll start again

HARD )

The laughter trails away And for a moment there is
nothing but the universe then

FADE OUT
