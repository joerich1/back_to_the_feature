murmur or think at some point If this isnt nice I dont know

EXT ROMANTIC FOUNTAIN - GLORIOUS AFTERNOON

An attractive middle-aged COUPLE sits on the edge of an
elaborately carved stone FOUNTAIN holding hands and warmly
looking at the camera Their names are PAUL and ELIZABETH
and they are telling their LOVE STORY

After this brief scene Paul and Elizabeth wont appear in
the script again because this is a COMMERCIAL

The tone is like the tone of those eHarmony commercials -
perhaps bordering on saccharine but this is definitely a
REAL COUPLE not actors

PAUL
Going to bars and being set up on
blind dates never worked but I
always knew there was somebody out
there for me

ELIZABETH
I had tried dating services and
dating sites but they never seemed
to get it right I was starting to
wonder if I was the problem

PAUL
Then a friend told me about Good
Looking It sounded too good to be
true but I figured what did I have
to lose Of course I wanted to know
who my soulmate was

ELIZABETH
Later on we realized that we had
both gone to Good Looking on the
same day

PAUL
We were looking for each other

ELIZABETH
And we never would have known it
without Good Looking

CUT TO
INT WHITE SPACE

The kind of borderless white room that is seemingly intrinsic
to all dating commercials

( )

In the middle of the room well-dressed and confident is
THEODORE KENT Theodore is a Steve Jobs type - an innovator
who is certain that his technology is revolutionary

THEODORE
Hello Im Theodore Kent and Im
the founder of Good Looking

(beat)

I started Good Looking in order to
solve a question that people have
been asking since the beginning of
time Who am I supposed to be with
Who is my soulmate

Theodores voice-over continues over a MONTAGE of HAPPY
COUPLES covering the spectrum of races and religions
couples chasing each other on the beach at sundown slow-
dancing on terraces with sweeping city views and sitting at
home in the kitchen sharing a bottle of wine

THEODORE (CONTD)
With over eight billion people in
the world it has always been
impossible to know who your true
soulmate is - until now

Another montage COUPLES kissing in slow-motion while the
DATE THEY GOT MARRIED flashes on the screen (ie JOHN
MICHELLE MARRIED JUNE 18th)

Some of the couples are combinations we wouldnt naturally
expect - a South American GAUCHO with a bleach-blond
CALIFORNIA GIRL for instance

THEODORE (CONTD)
Decades in development Good
Looking has come up with a formula
that guarantees we will match you
to your soulmate

The screen shows a clip of an ASIAN WOMAN at the airport
holding a sign that says AMEET An INDIAN MAN nervously
emerges from the terminal looks at the sign looks at the
Asian woman and EMBRACES her hugely

THEODORE (CONTD)
Good Looking has a 100 success
rate in putting people together
and weve done it over 300 million
times So what are you waiting for
Stop into your local Good Looking
office today

( )

Theodore smiles at the camera

THEODORE (CONTD)
(company motto)
Good Looking because there is
somebody for everyone™

Note Whenever there is a trademarked Good Looking tagline
a small TM should pop up in the corner of the screen

SMASH CUT TO

EXT JAMAICA PLAIN BOSTON - A HALF-BEAT IN THE FUTURE

This is Jamaica Plain Boston which is a trendy part of
Boston filled with young professional-ish apartments in three-
decker apartment buildings

In this story Boston is pretty much exactly the same as it
is now - with some differences that let us know were a FEW
YEARS IN THE FUTURE

For instance the CARS all look advanced compared to modern
vehicles - more hybrids - and cell phones are different
built straight into Bluetooth-esque devices That sort of
shit

EMMA (0C)
When you rolled over on me last
night I had a dream that I was
being suffocated by David Bowie

WILL (0C)
Compared to a lot of vegetarians
Im not that thin

And in one of the apartments in this neighborhood OUR HERO
and his FIANCE are starting their day

EMMA (0C)
I feel like your whole body is
turning into one big elbow
INT WILL AND EMMAS APARTMENT - SAME TIME
Meet WILL HARWICH (early 30s) a fit man whose interests are

highbrow - you could talk to him about Cy Twomblys graffiti
paintings but you wouldnt take him kickboxing

( )

Will is standing in the bedroom putting on a TIE and through
the open bedroom door he can see

EMMA SMITHSON (early 30s) in front of the television wearing
TIGHTS bouncing on one of those HUGE INFLATABLE BALLS that
somehow help people exercise

EMMA
Its like sleeping with a hairy
Karen Carpenter

WILL
Karen Carpenter actually was hairy
at the end of her life Anorexics
grow fuzz so their bodies stay
warm

EMMA
I feel like I need body hair to
keep me warm in bed What time were
you up until last night

WILL
Three

EMMA
You should just get it over with
and become a vampire I love a man
in velvet

WILL
Im not sure I could deal with the
blood

EMMA

You wimp Its only a couple of
little neck-holes

THEODORE (0C)
And heres another Good Looking
success story

Another Good Looking commercial comes on the air

WILL
Has anyone you known done that

EMMA
Good Looking

WILL
Im tired of hearing about it

( )

Will clips
searches a
Schupert -

EMMA
Everybody I know has done Good
Looking Julie is living in
Zimbabwe with a freedom fighter
(beat)
Without the service she would have
never known he was the guy for her

WILL
I hear its expensive

EMMA
I think people are chalking it up
to a one-time investment

WILL
Then Im glad we get to save the
money

EMMA
Aw Youre sweet
(beat)
Im sorry we argued last night
about the dance floor I know you
think hardwood would be classier

WILL
But you want it to light up like
Saturday Night Fever

EMMA
I just want it to light up like
Saturday Night Fever

WILL
Then it will Its your wedding

EMMA
Our wedding

age

Emma KISSES Will again We see that she is wearing an

ENGAGEMENT

EXT SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

SWEEPING VIOLIN MUSIC plays in Wills headphones as he walks
to the FOREST HILLS SUBWAY STATION

HAPPY WOMAN (VO)
Faster Mush

Out of the corner of his eye Will sees a HAPPY WOMAN
piggybacking on a THICKLY BUILT MAN wearing a business suit
who is running down the street with a huge GRIN on his face

THICKLY BUILT MAN
Smile for the camera

The Happy Woman blows a KISS at a CAMERA mounted on a LAMP
POST

In this modern world SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted
EVERYWHERE

PASSERBY
(yelling to Happy Woman)
You went to Good Looking
HAPPY WOMAN
(yelling back)
Best decision I ever made

The Happy Woman and her new man disappear around a corner
Will continues to walk

In front of the entrance to the subway station a DOZEN
COUPLES are saying goodbye to each other KISSING and
EMBRACING and whispering DIRTY THINGS

All people who have found TRUE LOVE

Will hears the sound of the train

WILL
Excuse me

( )

Will PUSHES through the lovers to make sure he gets on Many
people miss the train because they are making out They dont
care

INT SUBWAY CAR —- MOMENTS LATER

All over the place in the train there are COUPLES HOOKING
UP

Will looks at a long LCD SCREEN above the windows It
contains an image of a gray-haired couple on a beach at
sunset

EXT DOWNTOWN CROSSING - CONTINUOUS

The epicenter of Boston Will stops at a coffee stand where a
COFFEE GUY is working

In the background there is a LONG LINE of people outside
CITY HALL Women in WEDDING DRESSES and men in RENTED
TUXEDOES

Its like everybody in the world is getting married all at
once

WILL
(ordering coffee)
-No sugar and a bit of cream
please

A red-eyed BRIDE-TO-BE approaches the coffee stand

BRIDE-TO-BE
(to coffee guy)
Do you have any napkins I cant
stop crying because Im just so
happy

Will waits impatiently as the coffee guy hands the bride-to-
be some napkins The bride scurries away dabbing her eyes

COFFEE GUY
Happens all the time

Will takes his coffee into a plain-looking building and his
workday begins
INT FOSTERS AND ASSOCIATES - MOMENTS LATER

Fosters and Associates is a mid-sized private equity firm
like a thousand other companies that push money around

The analysts - of which Will is one - work in glorified
cubicles These are desks out in open space that dont have
actual walls but still theyre cubicles

Will takes a seat at his desk where his neighbor HENRY (30s)
is looking at a TOPLESS GIRL on his WAFER-THIN COMPUTER

Henry is an alpha male - husky but handsome He gets laid a
lot by trashy girls He is eating a MANGO

HENRY

God I love mango

(re topless girl)
Tits man If they were anywhere
else on a womans body I mean

(beat)
Speaking of women-

WILL
-Were we speaking of women

HENRY
You should see tonights special
lady

WILL

Im going to set a ground rule that
I get to finish my coffee before
you start talking about women

HENRY
Fine Have your coffee Slurp it
up
Will sips his coffee He stares at photograph of the CROATIAN
COAST attached to his computer which he clearly tore out of
a magazine

Beneath the picture of the coast is a picture of a VIOLIN in
a GLASS CASE

( )

Below that is a picture of a YOUNG PICASSO standing on top of

a PARISIAN ROOFTOP in 1902

HENRY (CONTD)

Shes insanely hot Im afraid

EMMA
If mine made money and vibrated
better I wouldnt need you

WILL
Whats going on

EMMA
I need you to pick up some
boutonnieres from JP Flowers on
your way back from work so we can
decide what your groomsmen are

wearing

WILL
But the wedding isnt for three
months

( )

This is the wrong thing to say to a bride-to-be

EMMA

EMMA
Oh and I hate to do this to you

grandmothers ring pillow from the
upholsterer You NEED TO DO IT

wearing KHAKI SAFARI CLOTHING

UPHOLSTERER
(looking at bill)

UPHOLSTERER

Will looks back and forth between the odd couple

sized WAND

TWEEDY ACADEMIC

INT WILL AND EMMAS APARTMENT - EVENING

Will nervously enters the apartment holding a half dozen
BOUTONNIERES as ordered He tries to play things off like
everything is fine

Emma walks into the room with her NIGHTSTICK

EMMA
(seeing flowers)
Aha Excellent

WILL
(wary)
I see you brought your club home

EMMA
I cracked it today breaking up a
protest and I need new one But I
thought I could keep this one
around the house in case you get
out of line

Emma studies the boutonnieres

EMMA (CONTD)
Ooh I like the red ones

( )

WILL
I was thinking the cream-colored
ones might be a little more subtle

EMMA
Who cares about subtle A wedding
is a celebration

WILL
Im giving you the Saturday Night
Fever floor You can bend on the
boutonnieres

EMMA
No way Id have your groomsmen
wearing atomic bombs if I could

WILL
My friends arent the kind of guys
who like to stand out

EMMA
Henry is

WILL
Henrys a different species

EMMA
Fine How about we drape your
groomsmen in cloaking devices so
that nobody sees them When they
give you the ring itll just be
floating in the air above the
altar and well blow the minds of
everybody in the vineyard

WILL
(beat)
I thought we were getting married
in a church

EMMA
(oh yeah)
Right I didnt tell you Were
having it at a vineyard now

WILL
But I dont drink

EMMA

Its a beautiful spot The pictures
will be stunning

( )

WILL

WILL
Youd have better pictures if you
did

EMMA

Dont think I have havent thought
about it Bring in some square-
jawed stuntman for a couple of
snaps

INT WILL AND EMMAS APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - LATER

In a half-bedroom that is essentially just a glorified nook
Will is standing in front of a WORK BENCH

On the work bench are various intricate-looking TOOLS and
pieces of WOOD along with cans of VARNISH and a selection of
STRINGS A shelf filled with books on STRADIVARI hangs above
the bench

Will is finishing up ASSEMBLING A VIOLIN He slides a TUNING
KNOB into place Done He picks up a bow

Note Will is not a good violinist He took lessons when he

was a kid and knows what they should sound like but he isnt
proficient This isnt Sweet and Lowdown Our actor will not

have to learn an instrument

Will presses play on a STEREO - a tape of a STRADIVARIUS
being played sounds He shuts it off

He bows his violin It sounds fine but it isnt the same as
the Stradivarius

WILL
Damn

He picks up the bow to try again but then loud music - ie
Pink Floyds Run Like Hell - blasts from the other room
drowning him out

INT WILL AND EMMAS APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Emma is dancing while she SEARCHES for something She sees

a picture of a professor and a DJ

EMMA
Down on the ground I just had it

WILL
It was a couple I think they were
bonding over their love of
stealing

EMMA
You didnt even run after them

WILL
I was in my suit
(beat)
I did pick up the boutonnieres

EMMA
(freaking out)
Oh God Ok Maybe the upholsterer
remembers the pattern and she can
make me a new pillow so my family
doesnt realize what happened
(MORE )

( )

Uh-oh

EMMA (CONTD)
(remembering)
No Wait The upholster is going
out of town to Africa for six
months She was squeezing me in
before she left tonight Oh God
What are we going to do

WILL
(mumb1es )
Maybe we should go to Africa

EMMA
Did you say maybe we should go to
Africa Thats your solution

WILL
I just I was walking by a travel
agency tonight

EMMA
Because you were planning our
honeymoon Were you flying ina

Will says nothing

EMMA (CONTD)
You lost my pillow and you forgot

WILL
I was there and just thinking
about the whole three months to the

wondering if maybe we needed a few
more adventures-

EMMA
-I cant believe youre bringing

WILL
-Before we settled

EMMA

(foreboding)
Settled

( )

WILL
I mean do you feel like youve
experienced enough to know that

we should be trying new things

Emma stares at Will She doesnt seem to agree

EMMA
I dont know Will While were in

new babies bushmeat and youre out
hunting your passions with a FAT
SPEAR

WILL
Emma

EMMA
Im thirty-one years old Ive had
plenty of adventures with all sorts
of adventurous adventurers But

Will pauses He shouldnt have paused
EMMA (CONTD)
(burning)
Oh get out

WILL
That pause wasnt meant to indicate-

EMMA

WILL
Ah crap Emma

Emma grabs the NIGHTSTICK and ADVANCES holding it above her
head

WILL (CONTD)
Okay okay okay Im leaving

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

SMASH CUT TO

INT HENRYS APARTMENT - LATER

Will knocks on the door Henry opens it looking like he is
having the BEST TIME OF HIS LIFE

HENRY
You are about to see a great
victory by a great man

GIRL (0C)
Thats not fair

Henry walks into the apartment and sees the GIRL that he has
been hearing in the background Her name is AMINA She
is a phenomenal looking MOROCCAN WOMAN

AMINA
Im out of practice

She is sitting in front of a CHESS BOARD that only has a few
pieces remaining What Will thought was debauchery was just
the sound of Will and Amina having the time of their lives
while PLAYING CHESS

( )

HENRY
Out of practice my ass This woman -
Henry meet Amina -

AMINA
Hello

HENRY
-Was Morocco Junior Champion

AMINA
I came in ninth place

HENRY
And I lowly president of the
Cornell Chess Club am on the verge
of ruining everything she ever
loved

WILL
(to Henry)
You play chess

HENRY
Every Sunday afternoon

AMINA
He switched a knight and a rook
while I was in the bathroom

HENRY
(winking at Will)
These crimes of which Im accused

Will is confused He has never seen Henry get along with a
woman never mind a woman like this

The remnants of a nice DINNER lay on the dining room table

A bottle of nice WINE sits on the windowsill where Henry and
Amina had obviously been sitting

A collection of ASIAN BIRD PRINTS - cranes loons etc - is
spread out on the coffee table like Henry had been showing
them off

WILL
Whats with the Asian bird prints

( )

HENRY
You didnt know I collected Asian
bird prints Have been for years
You dont come over here much

Will is thunderstruck

HENRY (CONTD)
(moving rook into place)
And that is checkmate

AMINA
I demand an investigation

HENRY
The FIDE rejects your appeal

AMINA
The FIDE lost credibility with the
Kasparov-Short scandal in 1993 I
dont recognize them

Henry and Amina CRUMBLE INTO LAUGHTER at this inside joke

The FIDE is chesss governing body but Will has no idea
what the hell they are talking about which is fine

HENRY
Amina laid out a blanket and pillow
for you on the couch I asked her
to call her sister to keep you
warm but she wouldnt do it I
said her brother would also be
fine

AMINA
Im sorry you had a tough night
Things will get better

HENRY
Look at that Comforting Bad at
chess From the jungle

AMINA
Morocco is mostly desert

HENRY
The perfect woman

Henry walks not-so-inconspicuously into the BEDROOM

( )

HENRY (CONTD)
Im sorry I cant sit with you
longer I need to walk over here to
my bedroom I have to feed my
cockatoo

AMINA
You have a cockatoo

HENRY
I have bird art dont I Of course

Will watches Amina stand She is smart and funny She is
exotic and beautiful What the hell is she doing with Henry

HENRY (CONTD)
Will if you need anything to eat
or drink help yourself Tea
bleach Drano whatever

AMINA
Nice meeting you

WILL
Nice meeting you too Amina

Amina disappears behind Henrys bedroom door Will lies down
on the couch wondering what he just witnessed And then

AMINA (0C)
Thats not a cockatoo

HENRY (0C)
(just whipped it out)
That is the finest cockatoo in the
word

Amina howls with laughter Will tries to sleep

INT FOSTERS AND ASSOCIATES - THE NEXT MORNING

Henry sits with his forehead on his desk in the same clothes
as he was the night before

He stands up and gets some coffee Looking out the window he

sees HENRY AND Amina walking towards the office building
HOLDING HANDS

( )

They blend in with all the other HAND-HOLDING COUPLES around
some of whom are pushing advanced-looking BABY CARRIAGES with
built-in screens playing CHILDRENS ENTERTAINMENT

MOMENTS LATER - Henry BURSTS into the office full of life
and energy

HENRY
Good morning good morning

Henry SIDESTEPS his way over to his desk Fred Astaire-style

HENRY (CONTD)
Does the office smell like pine
trees to anybody else Its like if
you had a pine tree whose bark was
made of cinnamon

Henry sees the bags under Wills eyes

HENRY (CONTD)
Whoa raccoon boy Apologies if
Amina and I kept you up last night
We were creating a master race of
humans made of pure love

Will goes back to his computer

EXT FANEUIL HALL - EARLY AFTERNOON

Its lunchtime and the hordes are filing out of their
buildings to find something to eat

Will wanders down the street eating a CREPE his mind
somewhere else

And then he sees Henry sitting alone at a CAFE scribbling
something There is no food or drink in front of Henry

WILL
Not eating

HENRY
Im stuffed With breastmilk

WILL

Im pretty sure Amina isnt
lactating

( )

Henry goes

HENRY
Fine But I had them in my mouth a
lot

WILL

What are you doing

HENRY
(proud)
Writing a letter to her

WILL
Youve never written a letter in
your life

HENRY
I am now Im not sure the lunch
break is going to be long enough

back to writing

WILL
Henry can I ask you a question

HENRY
Of course

WILL
Where the fuck did you find her

HENRY
What Amina

WILL
No offense weve known each other
a long time but youre by far my
most sleazy friend Youve never
had relationship last longer than a
month you read books on picking up
women youve had the clap three

times

HENRY
Twice That last one was something
else

WILL

So where did you find a beautiful
intelligent Moroccan girl who seems
to adore you

Henry looks at Will like hes an idiot

( )

Will looks

HENRY

Where the hell do you think I got
her I went to Good Looking

WILL
But youve never wanted to settle
down

HENRY

I thought I would give it a shot to
find out what soulmate sex was
like and then move on to the next
girl but I really like her for
some reason

(beat)
You know you should call them

WILL
Im not going to call

HENRY
Youre not even curious about it

WILL
I already found the woman Im
supposed to be with

HENRY

And thats great I mean as long
as youre sure

(beat)
Because - if youre not sure - what
a tragedy To only have one life
and not be able to spend it with
the person youre supposed to be
with

at Henry
HENRY (CONTD)

Im just saying It might be worth
a call

INT WILL AND EMMAS APARTMENT - LATER

EMMA

Will nods He exits

EXT SIDEWALK - LATER
Will walks down the street which is JAM PACKED with hand-

holding couples out for LATE-NIGHT STROLLS All of whom are
crazily in love

( )

He looks at the (slightly advanced-looking) cars driving past
- it seems like virtually every car has JUST MARRIED or some
variation thereof SOAPED onto the back window

He sits down on a BENCH A couple sits down next to him and
are immediately ALL OVER EACH OTHER He gets up and walks
away

Finally he sees a SOLITARY MAN walking ALONE down the
street Will nods at him

WILL
I think youre the only other
person walking alone tonight

SOLITARY MAN
(gruff )
I got divorced today My wife went
to Good Looking

WILL
Im sorry

SOLITARY MAN
All of these couples getting
together means a lot of couples are
falling apart People gotta come
from somewhere

WILL
Im sure it will be okay Keep your
head up

SOLITARY MAN
Nah Im looking at the ground
because I dropped the number for
Good Looking and I want to make an
appointment

WILL
Oh

SOLITARY MAN
Me and my wife were never right for
each other anyway I hope they give
me somebody prettier

WILL

(not sure what to say)

Will continues on his way Halfway down the block he sees
something stuck in a SIDEWALK CRACK He picks it up It is
printed with this

HOOD OF A CAR

INSIDE the car a hand SLAPS the window - not only is there a
couple making out on the hood of the car there is a couple
getting it on in the BACK SEAT

EXT NEWBURY STREET - NIGHT

Will stands in front of Urban Outfitters There are signs in
the window for various items for sale in the store (ie
LEVIS STOVEPIPE JEANS - NOW ONLY 2600)

Across the street is a smart looking building with an awning
marked GOOD LOOKING

There is a LINE AROUND THE BLOCK with people waiting to get
in and looking through the window its clear the inside of
the office is PACKED

WILL
Youve got to be kidding me

Will gets in the back of the LINE where he stands behind a
man on CRUTCHES wearing an AIR CAST on his LEG

WILL (CONTD)
What happened to you

INJURED MAN
Girlfriend broke my leg Need a
better one

Will nods Makes sense that this guy would be in line

All of a sudden a NERDY-LOOKING MAN approaches Will in the
line

BENJAMIN

WILL

BENJAMIN

phone

INT GOOD LOOKING - MOMENTS LATER

The lobby of the Good Looking offices is crowded - every seat
is occupied by NERVOUS INDIVIDUALS some of whom are taking
off their WEDDING RINGS

A service window in the lobby is marked with a sign that says
GOOD LOOKING BUYS RINGS CASH FOR GOLD

( )

A TRASHY YOUNG WOMAN slides her cheap-looking wedding band to
the RING BUYER who weighs it and hands her back some CASH

RING BUYER
There you are - nineteen thousand
dollars

TRASHY YOUNG WOMAN
(indignant)
Thats all

WILL
(re ring selling)
Thats a depressing sight

BENJAMIN
It never takes long for people to
get new ones Right this way

Benjamin leads Will through a DOOR into the BACK ROOMS of

Good Looking He stops in front of an OFFICE

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Have a seat

Will steps inside the office and Benjamin shuts the door
behind him

INT GOOD LOOKING —- OFFICE —- CONTINUOUS

As soon as the door clicks shut Will sees that he and
Benjamin are NOT ALONE Behind the desk is a gray-haired man
whose confident face Will has seen before

BENJAMIN
Will youre the recipient of a
rare honor
(dramatic)

Id like you to meet Theodore Kent

The founder of Good Looking

THEODORE
(warmly)
Hello Will

WILL
What are you doing here

( )

Will says

THEODORE
I was in town to inspect the
office and I was walking past
Benjamin when I heard him talking
to you I dont get much face time
with clients any more - an
unfortunate by-product of our
success - but I thought perhaps I
could allay some of the doubts you
seem to be having

WILL
Im not having ‘doubts I just
dont think I want to do it

THEODORE
And why is that

WILL
I think it might be a scam and
youre ruining a lot of lives

THEODORE
We have a 100 success rate with
putting people together

WILL
But how many divorces have there
been because you said a husband or
wife was supposed to be with
somebody else

THEODORE
Weve improved many more lives than
weve ruined and we offer a Half-
Price Spouse Special™ to clients
whose husbands or wives have left
them after visiting Good Looking

WILL
Generous

THEODORE
And there is always a reason those

spouses came to us in the first
place Like you did

nothing

( )

THEODORE (CONTD)

I understand You dont know how my
company works and if you dont
want to do it thats completely
fine We have enough customers

(beat)
But before you go Id like to do
something different Id like to
give you a tour of our facilities
which I think might answer some of
your questions

BENJAMIN
(concerned)
Dr Kent
THEODORE

Its fine Benjamin We know that
Mr Harwich is able to keep
secrets

(wink)
Unless its lying to work about
being sick which you did eleven
times last year if Im not
mistaken

Theodore begins his tour leading Will and Benjamin to a BANK
OF MONITORS

THEODORE
I started Good Looking in London in
the 1990s when cameras were
installed all over the city to
deter crime Benjamin pull up
London please

Benjamin taps a few keys and starts FLICKING through
different cameras showing different city scenes in London -
HUSTLERS in Soho a COUPLE on a stroll in Kensington Gardens
DINERS in Notting Hill

THEODORE (CONTD)

Londons CCTV cameras ran on a
series of individual networks that
I tapped It seems almost quaint
compared to todays world but if
you lived in London at the turn of
the century you were captured on
camera more than 400 times a day

Various SURVEILLANCE IMAGES flash on the screen as Theodore
rattles off samples of what CCTV is recording

THEODORE (CONTD)
Where you went

- A YOUNG WOMAN walking into a screening of BULLIT

THEODORE (CONTD)
What you bought

A YOUNG MAN buying a biography of STEVE MCQUEEN

THEODORE (CONTD)
Where you sat when you were alone

- An OLD MAN fishing from the banks of the THAMES

Where you went when you wanted to
be with people
- An OLD WOMAN sitting on a Thames BENCH with her FRIENDS
THEODORE (CONTD)

Who you went home with when you had
a one-night stand

- A MAN and WOMAN furiously MAKING OUT as they get into the
back of a CAB

THEODORE (CONTD)
What time you snuck back into your
own bed

- The WOMAN doing the walk of shame back to her home

THEODORE (CONTD)
How often you laughed when you were
with friends

- A BLOKE raising a pint with his buddies in a great mood

THEODORE (CONTD)
How often you prayed

- A JEWISH WOMAN entering a synagogue

THEODORE (CONTD)
And whether or not those prayers
were answered

- The Jewish Womans lost LABRADOR RETRIEVER comes home She
throws her arms around it

THEODORE (CONTD)
I called the company Good Looking
because I had access to the
cameras and anything that CCTV
knew I knew

WILL
God

THEODORE
Pretty much

SMASH CUT TO

ANOTHER ROOM in the Good Looking complex COMPUTERS are
everywhere A POWERFUL DATA SERVER stands like a sentinel in
the middle of the room

THEODORE (CONTD)
There was so much information

coming in from the cameras that I
needed a way to organize it all

(MORE )

( ) THEODORE (CONTD)

So I wrote an algorithm that
allowed me to take information on
people and put it into profiles

BOARD

THEODORE (VO)
Once I had these profiles I was
able to match them to other
profiles finding people who
complemented each other perfectly

Theodore turns his attention to his COMPUTER punches in some
information and watches as the computer runs through COMPLEX
CALCULATIONS until it produces an image of CHRIS MARTIN

He nods satisfied
CUT BACK TO

The present Benjamin hands Theodore a JUICE BOX straw
already inserted

WILL
Like a dating site

THEODORE
Oh weve put all of those out of
business The problem with dating
sites is that people lie about who
they are or only show what they
want other people to know

BENJAMIN
With our system we know who they
are For instance if youre on
plushies kick and you want to dress
like Scooby-Doo you probably wont
mention it in a public profile

( )

THEODORE
But wed take those things into
account when we match you up

WILL
But theres so much data to
compile

THEODORE

Think of Google which also handles
huge amounts of data Yet it allows
you to search for exactly what you
want Thats what we do

CUT TO

FOOTAGE FROM VARIOUS CITIES AROUND THE WORLD

Berlin Stockholm Moscow Kathmandu La Paz - all of them
are having state-of-the-art surveillance systems installed

THEODORE (VO)
In the years after I started the
company more and more cameras were
installed in cities and towns all
over the world

A group of GAMBIAN TRIBAL VILLAGERS sit around a COMPUTER in
their village - part of one of those Microsoft computers-for-
everybody programs

The tribal villagers look at a SECURITY TECHNICIAN installing
a CAMERA in the center of the village

THEODORE (VO) (CONTD)
Pretty soon the cameras were just
a tiny part of it because people
kept incorporating increasingly
powerful technology into their
everyday lives I made sure that
where there was technology there
was Good Looking

CUT BACK TO
GOOD LOOKING

Theodore finishes his juice box and hands it back to
Benjamin

( )

THEODORE
But I was frustrated because I
couldnt be as accurate with the
matchmaking as I wanted So I hired
technicians like Benjamin to come
up with ways to gather and organize
more information

BENJAMIN
We can go into computer data
servers to track individual IP
addresses to see what people have
looked at on the web see what
library books theyve checked out
what movies theyve rented what
theyve bought on their credit
card anything

THEODORE
It all helps us create the
profiles We not only look for
people who match up but for people
who really complement each other

WILL
Is this legal

THEODORE
(smiles)
If you think Im watching people
you have no idea how many people
are watching me

WILL
But with that kind of power arent
there better ways to make money
than matchmaking

THEODORE

(smiles)
I was Good Lookings first
customer I was miserable until I
met my wife and every day since I
found her has been more than I
could have ever imagined I cant
think of a better gift to the world
than giving people that kind of
happiness

WILL
For a price

( )

THEODORE
We have a lot of overhead as you
can imagine
(beat)
Im one of the good guys Will
This is what I have devoted my life
to

What about people who live in
remote regions

-How would you define a soulmate
Somebody who understands you better
than anyone in the world Somebody
who you feel like youve met
before Somebody who fulfills
something within you is your best
friend makes you feel alive

WILL
Yeah

THEODORE
We find that person Our business
model doesnt work unless we are
perfect so we get it right Every
Time

Will thinks about this Theodore is sure convincing

THEODORE (CONTD)

Now lets get you started Its
eight million dollars for the
service

Will visibly reels at the price but Theodore and Benjamin
are nonplussed

BENJAMIN
You have the cash in your checking
account HSBC I believe

WILL

Im sorry again But I dont think
this service is for me

( )

THEODORE
Now why is that

WILL
Emma is the woman Im supposed to
be with for the rest of my life

BENJAMIN
Then eight million dollars is
nothing at all to pay for peace of
mind

want to know

Actually its quite a lot to pay
for peace of mind

Does she know Im coming

Of course not Youre the one who
paid for the service not her
Dont worry Youll click People

WILL
You dont even provide an
introduction

THEODORE
If you cant get up the nerve to
introduce yourself to the person
you know youre supposed to be
with then you shouldnt be with
anybody

This is too much for Will to take He is angry He SHOVES the

post-it in his wallet

WILL
Great scam you have here
gentlemen Thank you for wasting my
time

Theodore and Benjamin dont react Theyve seen such

outbursts before

somehow got us into the Museum of
Fine Arts after hours so he could
give me a private tour of the

Im not sure but that sounds like
quite a classy guy

EMMA
Then it must be the boyfriend who
came on a ride-along in my police
car and had a long discussion with
a mugger about acoustic theory

It sounds like your boyfriend has a
natural empathy for the criminal

Would this also be the boyfriend
who is the best thing that has ever
happened to me

while Emma is in the living room bouncing up and down on her

huge exercise ball

Emma is watching DAYS OF THUNDER on television TOM CRUISE is

in the middle of the climactic FINAL RACE

TOM CRUISE
(intense)
Im going to draft Wheeler Make
him pull me around

EMMA
Punch it Tom

Cruise PUNCHES it and his race car ZOOMS Emma switches to

push-ups her eyes still on the screen

WILL
Days of Thunder This is one of
your desert island movies right

( )

EMMA
No If I was on a desert island I
would bring Cast Away Its the
only thing that would make sense
because Hanks has already figured
everything out for you

WILL
Thats true The existence of Cast
Away renders moot the desert island
movie discussion
(beat)
Im leaving Do you need me to pick
up anything

EMMA
Actually I do Remember what I was
saying about the centerpieces for
the tables

WILL
You wanted them to be filled with
seaglass

EMMA
But I dont know what color sea
glass

Will realizes what Emma is suggesting

WILL
Oh come on

SMASH CUT TO

EXT CARSON BEACH - AFTERNOON

A hidden treasure in South Boston completely deserted at the
moment Will walks along the shore staring at the SAND

He spots a piece of RED SEAGLASS tangled in some seaweed He
reaches down to pick it up Its beautiful He holds it in
his hand running his finger over it

There is also a person with a METAL DETECTOR on the beach
Its an awesome metal detector - all sleek lines and blipping
computer lights

The Metal Detector-er is looking at the sand the same as
Will They are walking towards each other but dont know it

( )

Will and the Metal Detector-er nearly crash into each other
but disaster is averted when the BOTTOM OF THE METAL DETECTOR
lightly taps Wills ANKLE

WILL
Oh Im sorry-

METAL DETECTOR-ER
-No no its my fault I didnt
even see you

The Metal Detector-er is a WOMAN and when Will raises his
eyes to look at her he is temporarily caught off guard

METAL DETECTOR-ER (CONTD)
Sorry I zone out pretty hard when
Im using my metal detector

The woman looks like a flapper - short hair easy grace and
stunning

METAL DETECTOR-ER (CONTD)
Seaglass hunt

She has spotted the red seaglass Will is holding

WILL
I just found it

METAL DETECTOR-ER
Youre lucky Red is rare

WILL
Is it

METAL DETECTOR-ER
Brown white and green are the most
common and red and orange are the
hardest to find

WILL
Im surprised there isnt more
seaglass around When I was a kid
this was the place to go

METAL DETECTOR-ER
(smiles)
It still is I just stole it all

WILL
Cornering the market

( )

METAL DETECTOR-ER
I sell it at my shop You have no
idea how popular it is

WILL
I might I need a ton of it

METAL DETECTOR-ER
For what

WILL
For-

For some reason Will stops himself and makes one of those
inexplicable split-second decisions

WILL (CONTD)
-an art project
(beat)
Im going to glue them To wood

METAL DETECTOR-ER
Ive got more than you could ever
want or need You should come in

The woman hands Will her BUSINESS CARD and one look at it is
all it takes to knock the wind out of him

THE STONE STORE
Proprietor Sophie Miller

This is the woman Will is supposed to be with

WILL
(barely able to speak)
Ill stop by

SOPHIE

search

WILL

SOPHIE

Sophie smiles at Will and puts on her metal detector
headphones

Will watches her as she walks away scanning the sand

The Stone Store is a little shop set back from the road in a
forgotten corner of Brookline

As might be expected there are a few FANCY ROCKS in the
front window along with some RUNE NECKLACES

Will stands across the street from the store getting up his
nerve Finally he begins the walk to the front door

INT THE STONE STORE - CONTINUOUS

The store is filled with more geology-oriented stuff FOOLS
GOLD various FOSSILS of SKELETAL FISH and ancient
FOOTPRINTS bricks of JADE and so forth

SOPHIE stands behind the counter engrossed in a biography of
the Italian violinist PAGANINI Which Will finds interesting

WILL
(surprised)
Huh

Will browses through some POSTERS - mostly TOPOGRAPHY MAPS
and ROCK CLASSIFICATION CHARTS

He flips to the last poster which doesnt fit with the
others - it is a COOL HAND LUKE promotional one-sheet

WILL (CONTD)
Does Paul Newman count as a rock

Sophie looks up from her book and sees Will She recognizes
him from the beach and smiles

( )

SOPHIE
I think so
(beat)
Im glad you came in

WILL
You promised me seaglass

SOPHIE
Behold The nations strategic
seaglass reserve

Sophie spreads her arms to a huge glass VASE that is chock-a-
block FILLED with seaglass It looks like a layer cake - all
the glass is organized by COLOR

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Im almost reluctant to sell you
any I only finished filling the
jar last week

WILL
Its so precise
Sophie laughs
SOPHIE

Scary right

WILL
So if you found a piece of brown-

SOPHIE
-I would pour out the entire jar to
add it to the bottom level with the
other pieces of brown

WILL
And then you put them all back in
by color

SOPHIE

I dont know if you noticed but I
own a stone store I have the time

Will laughs

WILL
How did you get into stones

SOPHIE
(sincere)

SOPHIE
-You wanted to ask me out just

bench next to the pretty pretty MARY holding hands (in all
of these commercials the couples must always be holding

honestly couldnt believe she was
the woman I had been matched with
She seemed so different from me

MARY
(southern accent)
I was the president of the Bible
club at Boston College

DAMIAN
And I was not When I saw Mary
walking out of her Jesuit study
group-

MARY

-A great lecturer came in to talk
about the Epistle to the Ephesians-

DAMIAN
-I almost walked away because I
figured there was no way this was
the right girl But then I just
said to myself Good Looking I
hope you know what youre doing
and I walked up to her

( )

MARY

Ive always liked it when guys dye
their hair black Ive just never
been around many who do aside from
old guys at church

bottles look like snazzy torpedoes

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Holy shit You brought Smirnoff
Ice I didnt know they still made

he screws together to make a TABLE

SOPHIE (CONTD)

Whoa Where did you get that

WILL
I bought it from one of those
SkyMall catalogues they have on
airplanes

SOPHIE
No way Nobody has ever bought
anything from SkyMall

Will spreads his arms over the table - the proof is before
you

Sophie sits in her seat holding the SkyMall catalogue up to
a FLIGHT ATTENDANT She POINTS to something and the
attendant walks into the rear cabin

Like if you wanted a bigfoot
garden sculpture they would just
have it right there

The flight attendant struggles to drag a huge BIGFOOT

SCULPTURE out of the back of the plane It must weigh 200
lbs

Sophie takes a look at the bigfoot and SHAKES HER HEAD NO
The flight attendant starts dragging the bigfoot away

Young Will looks at his TEACHERS SKIRT concerned about what
might be under there and runs out of the room

CUT BACK TO

EXT LARZ ANDERSON PARK

Silence

SOPHIE
--It certainly wouldnt be a
puritanical thing for the Puritans
to do

WILL
Maybe they figured it was their
country so they could do what they
wanted

SOPHIE
I think you and I have a strangely
similar way of looking at things

WILL
I guess that means youre not going
to make a run for it

SOPHIE
I prefer to travel rather than stay
at home

WILL

I stand outside of the same travel
center every day

Nearby is the LARZ ANDERSON AUTO MUSEUM housed in an crazy
old CARRIAGE HOUSE

Lifting Sophie up seems like a good beverage-influenced
idea They walk over to the building and Will HOISTS Sophie
up so she can look through a WINDOW but she only gets a
BRIEF GLIMPSE inside before they both come crashing down

COMPACTOR in a KITTY LITTER BOX etc
- A NAKED MAN lying on a bed with GEOLOGICAL CHART BLANKETS
- A thick CRYSTAL from the Stone Store lying on a TABLE
- A GEODE filled with tubes of ASTROGLIDE

A bunch of ground-up TRILOBITE FOSSILS cut into LINE - it

Henry was right - Sophie is a FREAK

CUT BACK TO

EXT THE STONE STORE

Will and Sophie together

SOPHIE
My apartment needs a couple of days

WILL

Thats fair

SOPHIE
Its still early We could find
something else to do

EXT MOVIE THEATRE —- LATER

Will and Sophie linger outside of a THEATRE looking at their
choices

The only film playing is an ACTION MOVIE called BOOM
starring an elderly VIN DIESEL (or an equivalent modern
action star who is young-ish now but wouldnt be young when
this story is taking place)

WILL
Should we see BOOM

SOPHIE
If its the only thing playing

INT MOVIE THEATRE —- LATER

Will and Sophie sit side-by-side watching Vin Diesel in BOOM
Vin Diesel is holding a BABY while firing a FLAMETHROWER at a
horde of CYCLOPSES

ELDERLY VIN DIESEL
(cool)
Conjuncti-bite-this

Will smiles at the terrible movie He looks over at Sophie
who ISNT ENJOYING IT ONE BIT

EXT MOVIE THEATRE —- LATER

Will and Sophie walk away from the theatre towards a bunch
of BARS

SOPHIE
Youll have to show me how to
appreciate bad movies

WILL
I think you have to look at it from
the perspective of the universe
having balance So every time a bad
movie is made

SOPHIE
Something good happens somewhere
Like a dumpster baby is adopted by
a rich family or something

( )

WILL
Exactly

Approaching them heading to the next bar are HENRY and
AMINA They seem happy together playing around and flirting

Henry sees SOPHIE for the first time and a huge GRIN spreads
across his face

Amina is a little confused - this isnt the woman they had
dinner with - but Henry gives her a look to let her know its
fine

HENRY
William Who the hell is this
winsome companion

WILL
Sophie this is my degenerate co-
worker Henry and his girlfriend
Amina

HENRY
Im actually keeping her firmly at
special friend status

Amina smacks Henry

WILL
Henry is a bad human being but
Amina is changing him

HENRY
Were going to the bar Youre
coming I need to know this
beautiful woman I will never have

AMINA
Henry

WILL
Were actually-

HENRY
Bar time Lets go

INT BAR - LATER

Will and Sophie are sitting across from Henry and Amina Will
drinks a bottle of COKE Sophie drinks WINE

( )

HENRY
(drunk )
-IM THE LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE Look
at this WOMAN Im with

Amina rolls her eyes

HENRY (CONTD)
Im not going to lie It took me a
little while to get used to some of
Aminas techniques

AMINA
Henry Shut up

HENRY
But then lying there after she
really scared me once I started
thinking about The Exorcist and I
just thought at some point that
priest needed to learn how to
exorcise the devil and then it
probably got more natural for him
as he did it over and over

AMINA
(embarrassed)
Oh God
HENRY
(re Will)

And THIS guy - and MAN I love him -

hes been a reserved intellectual

guy for so long that its nice to

finally see him taking risks
(beat)

I mean not that its a risk to go

to Good Looking but still

Sophie looks at Will

SOPHIE
You went to Good Looking

WILL
(beat)
Yeah

SOPHIE

So the seaglass thing You
planned

( )

WILL
No actually I was just there

AMINA
(chiming in)
It was fate

Sophie takes this in Its big news

SOPHIE
Wow Holy shit I mean Its you
WILL

Im afraid so

HENRY
(low)
Sucks right

Sophie leans in and KISSES Will

SOPHIE

(happy )
Im glad its you

As Sophie and Will kiss Henry looks up at a TELEVISION
hanging above the bar where a GOOD LOOKING COMMERCIAL is
playing

SMASH CUT TO

WHITE SPACE
As always Theodore Kent is breaking it down for us

SMASH CUT TO

EXT CENTRAL SQUARE FARMERS MARKET - CAMBRIDGE - DAY

Will and Sophie walk together through the vendors and crowds
of the Central Square Farmers Market They pass a pair of
women pushing BABY CARRIAGES

SOPHIE
No Way

WILL
You dont want kids

SOPHIE
Maybe in an abstract sense - you
know the Lion King circle of life
and that crap But I feel like I
need to have a few more adventures
before I have kids

WILL
I hear that
(beat)

(MORE )

( )

WILL (CONTD)

But Im sure that baby clock thing
will kick in with you eventually

SOPHIE
Im not sure There are so many
jerks in the world when I see a
baby I start thinking - when you
look at the statistics - the baby
is probably going to be a dick when
he gets older

WILL
Which makes the baby less cute

SOPHIE
Right I sometimes see them as
little balding insurance agents
who cheat on their wives
(beat)
So Im glad you want a few
adventures first too

Will nods but theres something about the look on his face
that seems unsure

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Speaking of adventure

One of the Boston DUCK BOATS rolls past filled with
tourists

SOPHIE (CONTD)

Oh hell yes were doing it
INT DUCK BOAT - LATER
Will and Sophie ride in a DUCK BOAT that is heading towards
the choppy CHARLES RIVER The boat has been retrofitted a
SOLAR SAIL to power it along
The boat is crowded with COUPLES celebrating their HONEYMOONS
and LOVERS all over each other sitting on each others laps

feeling each other up paying no attention to the tour etc

Will and Sophie are sitting up front in the exposed splash
seats

SOPHIE
Is the Charles polluted

( )

WILL
My dad used to swim it

SOPHIE
And he didnt grow any extra
appendages or anything

WILL
He did have a little nubbin of a
sixth toe

SOPHIE
Then the river made him radioactive
and he sprouted a nubbin

WILL
I cant prove it didnt

SOPHIE
Excellent Ill grow a third boob
and youll get another dick and
well make movies
(to driver)
Damn the torpedoes Faster

The boat steams forward and SPLASHES down into the Charles
River Torrents of water SPRAY over Will and Sophie They are
DRENCHED Sophie HOWLS with laughter

Once the boat is in the river it floats calmly along Sophie
wipes water out of her face and looks at Will

He looks at her Her makeup is smudged and she is smiling
hugely its one of those moments that SHOULD make him go
I love this girl - a perfect moment

But for some reason he isnt feeling that

And he is aware of it

SOPHIE (CONTD)
(laughing)
I think we got the worst of the
splash

WILL
(throwaway )
I think so

Will looks out at the river letting the moment PASS He
seems confused

INT BOSTON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE - NIGHT

Will and Sophie walk up to the TICKET VENDOR at the Museum of
Science

WILL
Two please

TICKET VENDOR

Do you want combination tickets
They include the Planetarium

Will and Sophie look at each other

WILL
Combination tickets would be great

Sophie slides a PIECE OF PAPER to the ticket vendor It’s
Summit’s permission slip that she found in the couch

SOPHIE
This is his permission slip in
case you need it

TICKET VENDOR
Thatll be thirteen hundred
dollars

WILL
Whats playing at the Planetarium

TICKET VENDOR
Same thing that always is
INT BOSTON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE - PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

Will and Sophie are lying on their backs in the Museum of
Science’s PLANETARIUM beholding the LASER PINK FLOYD SHOW

Lasers dance across the theatre’s curved ceiling accompanied
by the band’s “Goodbye Blue Sky

Will and Sophie watch

SOPHIE
Man Pink Floyd sucks

WILL
I cant stand Pink Floyd

( )

SOPHIE
Im not a drug person and this
doesnt work without drugs

WILL
We should lick the toads in the
amphibians exhibit

SOPHIE
Who the hell would come to this
willingly

Will knows who would come to Laser Pink Floyd voluntarily
And really enjoy it

That feeling of uneasiness creeps into him again

WILL
Lets get out of here

INT WILL (AND NO LONGER EMMAS) APARTMENT - NIGHT

All traces of Emma have been removed from the living room -
it looks like Will just shoved anything that had to do with
her in the corner and threw a SHEET over it to hide it

Will and Sophie are on the couch MAKING OUT like we havent
seen them make out before

SOPHIE
(in between kisses)
Im so happy its you My friend
went to Good Looking and it turned
out she was supposed to be with the
lead singer of a Queen cover band

WILL
What Freddy Mercury did she get
Moustache and jean shorts Unitard

SMASH CUT TO

INT DIRTY NIGHTCLUB

A glorious FREDDY MERCURY IMPERSONATOR - overbite and
everything - is on a too-small stage He is wearing one of
Mercurys skin-tight unitards held up by skinny SPAGHETTI
STRAPS and exposing a lushly hairy CHEST

( )

A PRETTY WOMAN watches him adoringly from the crowd mouthing
along with the words to Under Pressure

SOPHIE (VO)
Unitard But she loves him

CUT BACK TO

INT WILL (AND NO LONGER EMMAS) APARTMENT

WILL
To each their own

Sophie takes off her dress

SOPHIE
(naughty )
--Occasionally I lend mine out

WILL
Did you ever think of going to Good
Looking

SOPHIE
I think I was searching for the
right person in my own way I made
a lot of mistakes

WILL
Nothing is more intolerable than
to have to admit to yourself your
own errors

SOPHIE
Who said that

WILL
Beethoven

SOPHIE

I think thats the first time
anybody has slapped me with a
Beethoven quote when I was half

naked

WILL
Have you been slapped with other
things

SOPHIE

Oh God yeah

( )

WILL
Youre hilarious

SOPHIE
Im in love with you

This takes Will by surprise

WILL
(hedging)
Happened quick

SOPHIE
You should point me somewhere I can
make myself more comfortable

WILL
Theres no way you could get more
comfortable

SOPHIE
You have no idea how comfortable I
can get

Will points behind his towards the bedroom Emma climbs off
of him and heads in that direction She disappears

Will sits on the couch and takes a deep breath And then

SOPHIE (CONTD)
What is this

Will gets up from the couch and sees that Sophie has walked
into his WORKSHOP instead of the bedroom

SOPHIE (CONTD)
What are you doing in here

WILL
I build violins

SOPHIE
Ive never seen so many books on
the subject

WILL
I taught myself how to do it

She stands half-dressed looking at the violins hanging on
the wall

( )

SOPHIE
Do you sell them

WILL
I havent got one right yet

SOPHIE
How will you know when youve got
one right

WILL
Im trying to replicate the
sound of a Stradivarius

Sophie BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

SOPHIE
Come on Nobody has done that in
three centuries Thats the reason
theyre priceless

WILL
I think I can do it

SOPHIE

Ive read about this They cant be
replicated because those
instruments were made from wood
that grew under weird weather
conditions in the 1600s
No matter what you did youd never
get it right

(beat)
Im afraid you need to give it up

Will looks at Sophie curiously
SMASH CUT TO
FLASHBACK

The scene we saw earlier in the WORKSHOP with Emma hanging
over Wills shoulders late-night as he worked

EMMA
Youre going to do it baby I know
you will
SMASH CUT TO

THE PRESENT

( )

Will examines Sophies face

And in this moment Will knows that he has royally fucked up

SOPHIE
Dont look so stricken You just
need a new hobby
(beat)
And I may have a suggestion

WILL
(beat low)
I think you should leave
SOPHIE
Somebody is sensitive about his
violins
WILL

Its not that Well in a way it
is but- Im sorry You need to

SOPHIE
Youre kidding
WILL
I made a mistake
SOPHIE
(perplexed)

But were supposed to be together
Good Looking says-

WILL
-I know it does And Im perfectly
outrageously compatible with you -
I mean the fact that youve read
extensively about Stradivarius
violins says something Without
question Good Looking did its job

SOPHIE
So whats the problem
WILL
(realizing it as he
speaks)
Im not going to fall in love with

you

( )

SOPHIE
(beat)
How is that possible

WILL
You and I are perfect for each
other
(beat)
But I love my imperfect Emma

Sophie takes this in Shes hurt

SOPHIE
If Im supposed to be with you but
you want to be with somebody else
then what do I do

WILL
I think thats the way things used
to be for everybody Before Good
Looking I mean

SOPHIE
I was born in the wrong time Think
about how much simpler things were
in like 2010

Will nods Nothing left to say Sophie LEAVES the

CUT TO

EXT GOOD LOOKING - LATER

Will and Henry are parked outside of the Good Looking office
on Newbury Street

There are still LIGHTS on inside the office and HORDE of
people outside drinking and laughing

excited they announce the names to the throng

EXT ROUTE ONE —- DAYBREAK

Will drives the car down Route One towards MAINE

EXT BEACHFRONT INN - MAINE COAST - MORNING

Emma is sitting on the porch of a beachfront inn we recognize
from the photograph This is the place where she and Will got
engaged The beach is huge and empty She is in her pajamas
with a bathrobe wrapped around her looking out at a whale in
the ocean through some high-tech BINOCULARS

Then she hears the sound of a CAR

Emma focuses the binoculars in the direction of the back road
that is the only way to get to the inn and sees the car
coming Through the windshield she sees that Will is behind
the wheel

She puts down the binoculars and takes a sip of her morning
tea She puts down her cup and then picks up her trusty GUN
lying on the table nearby

Wills car gets closer

( )

Emma takes aim

And POP POP POP Emma BLOWS OUT the FRONT TIRES of the
electric car

The car swerves off the road into a SAND BANK

Satisfied Emma takes another sip of her tea

Will cracks open the WINDOW of the car and climbs out dazed
and bruised and bloodied He stumbles up the beach towards
the inn his hands above his head in surrender

WILL
Emma Hold on

Emma FIRES SEVERAL SHOTS at Wills feet SPRAYING SAND all
over him

WILL (CONTD)
Christ Come on Emma

EMMA
(calm)
Did you not get my message about me
shooting you if I saw you again

Will tentatively walks closer to the porch

Emma fires again - POP POP POP - and Will DANCES to get out
of the way

WILL
I got the message I got it

EMMA
And yet here you are
(beat)
What did you have your friends
with the cameras track me down

Will spreads his arms to the open beach

WILL

WILL
I made the biggest mistake of my
life

EMMA

Computer geek tell you to say that

WILL

I dont need technology to tell me
what I know And what I know - what
Ive always known - is that Im
supposed to be with you

(beat)
I am so so sorry that I doubted my
certainty of that

Emma seems touched - or at least touched enough to PUT DOWN
THE GUN And then we hear FOOTSTEPS

WILL (CONTD)
(confused)
Whats that sound

With that a MUSCULAR HANDSOME MAN walks out of the front
door of the inn also wearing a BATHROBE He SNIFFS Emmas
hair and kisses her on the top of the head

MAXIMILIAN

EMMA

MAXIMILIAN

(Belgian accent)

through the window with a SAD EXPRESSION on his face

EMMA
What should I do about Maximilian

SMASH CUT TO

EXT SCENIC VINEYARD - AFTERNOON

The WEDDING RECEPTION

( )

The VINEYARD where it is all taking place is immaculate with
rows of vines extending forever in all directions

Dozens of Will and Emmas friends and family are milling
around eating and dancing on a floor that lights up like
SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER

Henry stands in the center of the reception with Amina
drinking wine and taking it all in He is wearing a
boutonniere that verges on being TECHNICOLOR

AMINA
This is really nice

HENRY
It is really nice but let me point
some things out for you

Henry gestures at a SHORT BUS parked nearby

HENRY (CONTD)
A short bus to take the guests to
the reception What kind of message
does that send And look at that

A GUEST quietly spits her vegetable hors doeuvre into a
NAPKIN

HENRY (CONTD)
Bok choi hors doeuvres Nobody
wants that healthy crap at a
wedding And check it out

Henry points to the BAND that is playing for the guests Its
an excellent lively wedding band with a half-dozen
VIOLINISTS jammed into the act

HENRY (CONTD)
A band with six people fiddlin
This is Boston We dont have
hootenannies
(beat)
All parts of the wedding that Will
planned

AMINA
Everybody knows you should never

On the DANCE FLOOR Will and Emma are whirling wildly to the
music having the time of their lives They look incredible

WILL

WILL
Dance

EMMA

But they still make a lovely sound

We pull out on Emma and Will as they hold each other and
dance and generally have the time of their lives and we

FADE OUT

AND THEN FADE BACK IN

WHITE SPACE

Theodore once again fills the screen His demeanor is
SERIOUS

THEODORE

Allow me to be candid for a moment

(solemn)
A peculiar situation has come to
the attention of Good Looking in
which we made a match yet a member
of the pairing decided to stay with
his previous partner

(beat)
In light of this unprecedented
circumstance - which in no way
affects our 100 success rate
given that this couple was in fact
perfectly matched - Good Looking
will now be offering a free Second-
Chance Guarantee™ to anybody jilted
in this manner such as this
couple

EXT FOUNTAIN - DAY

Another fountain much like the one from the commercial at
the beginning of our story

But this time its MAXIMILIAN and SOPHIE who are sitting on
the edge of the fountain holding HANDS

SOPHIE
With Good Lookings new Second-Try

session when the man to whom I was
matched married somebody else

( )

MAXIMILIAN
I too had lost a woman who vuz

SOPHIE

muscular for my taste

MAXIMILIAN

SOPHIE
(kidding maybe)
And Im not sure what hes saying
all the time but Im glad to be
with somebody so close to ideal

MAXIMILIAN
Eet is true vat they say

Sophie goes in for a quick peck of a kiss on Maximilian
while goes in for some open-mouthed French action and they
press their faces together awkwardly

SOPHIE
(back to camera)
Theres somebody for everyone™

A final trademark TM pops up in the corner of the screen
the commercial turns off with a quick 2222ZT and with that
we

BLACK OUT
