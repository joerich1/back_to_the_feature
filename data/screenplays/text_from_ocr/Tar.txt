Based on this scripts page count it would be
reasonable to assume that the total running
time for TAR will be well under two hours
However this will not be a reasonable film
There will be tempo changes and soundscapes
that require more time than is represented on
the page and of course a great deal of music
performed on screen All this to say if you
are mad enough to greenlight this film be
prepared for one whose necessary length
represents these practical accommodations

THE TICK-TOCK OF A METRONOME

Punctuating credits filling a single black frame One after the
other side-by-side like players seated on a cramped stage

OPEN COLD

On a SMARTPHONE displaying the face of LYDIA TAR asleep
on the calfskin headrest of a G550 Someone tick-tock TEXTING
snide back-and-forth comments about her over the plane wifi

HER FACE AWAKE NOW

Somewhere else focused on something in the middle-distance
her posture and expression as steady as a statue Eyes
neutral Almost empty But this center will not hold Tick-
tock tick-tock tick--the metronome abruptly stops They
arrive in twos followed by a rest whisper(s) twice-cracked
knuckles The once and again hocking of phlegm Incessant
humming in a duet with someone who cannot whistle Chewing
and lip-smacking Sibilant sounds (SandP TandCH KandB) Abused
adverbs and adjectives such as so amazing and crazy Vocal fry
that culminates in double-upwardy teenagery question marks

A water bottle being squeezed and crinkled The rude rustle of
a plastic shopping bag in an otherwise quiet auditorium
Fingers digging the dregs from a popcorn tub The jiggle of a
table disturbed by a hyperactive leg The double-clicking of a
ballpoint pen The muffled bass of an over-volumed TV coupled
with the goose-stepping stride of someone walking on the floor
above The particular becomes the general the noises
described combine into a deafening mix like a foul orchestra
unsuccessfully attempting to tune Throughout the above Tars
face a cubist mask of winces and grimaces born of terror that
modulates into unmitigated rage Someones HAND squirts PURELL
into hers then passes her a GLASS of WATER and PILL in a PAPER
CUP she barely nods before washing it down ANGLE ADJUSTS to
see the svelte swaying back of her assistant FRANCESCA LENTINI depart with the empty glass into the backstage area of

Lydia Tar is many things a piano
performance graduate of the Curtis
Institute a Phi Beta Kappa graduate
of Harvard And she earned her PHD
in Musicology from the University of
Vienna specializing in indigenous
music from the Ucayali valley in
Eastern Peru where she spent five
years amongst the Shipibo-Konibo

The toes come to rest on the face of Claudio Abbado hunched

Throughout this period Tar became
known for championing contemporary

Hildur Gudnadottir Programming their
works alongside composers of the
canon This created controversy among
some in classical music circles

In twenty-ten with the support of
Eliot Kaplan she founded the
Accordion Conducting Fellowship
which fosters entrepreneurship and
performance opportunities for female
conductors allowing them residencies
with orchestras around the world

IN THE BACK OF THE HALL

Francesca turns her attention to the stage We STAY on HER
FACE listening to every word LIPS in PERFECT SYNCH with
Gopniks Robotic and unnerving

GOPNIK (0C) (CONTD)
In twenty-thirteen Berlin elected
Tar as its principal conductor in
succession to Andris Davis Shes
remained there ever since Like her
mentor Leonard Bernstein Tar has a
particular affinity with Mahler whose
nine symphonies she recorded during
her big five stints

CLOSER TO STAGE NOW

GOPNIK (CONTD)
However she never managed to
complete the so-called cycle with a
single orchestra That is until now
ON STAGE WITH GOPNIK and TAR

GOPNIK (CONTD)

Under her direction Berlin has
recorded eight Saving Symphony
number five for last Due to the
global pandemic that performance
scheduled for last year had to be
cancelled This they will remedy
next month with a live recording
that will complete a box set to be
released on Mahlers birthday by
Deutsche Gramophon And Tars new
book Tar on Tar published under
the Nan Talese imprimatur at
Doubleday will be available here in
the US just before Christmas -- a
great stocking-stuffer if you have a
very large stocking

(polite crowd laughs)
From all of us at the New Yorker
thank you Maestro for taking the
time to be with us today

(wild applause lulls)
At some point I saw you visibly
flinch as I read your bio Did I
leave something out or are you self-
conscious about the incredibly
varied things that youve achieved

TAR
Well in todays world variedis a
dirty word Our era is one of
specialists And if someone is
trying to do more than one thing
its often frowned upon

GOPNIK

You mean were all typecast
TAR

Yes aggressively so
GOPNIK

When do people who write about classical
music stop using gender as distinction

TAR
Im probably the wrong person to
ask since I dont read reviews

GOPNIK
Do you read any press at all

TAR
No But it is odd that people ever
felt compelled to substitute
maestro with maestra
TAR (CONTD)
We dont call women astronauts
astronettes But as to the
question of gender bias I have
nothing to complain about Nor
for that matter should Nathalie
Stutzmann Laurence Equilbey
Marin Alsop or JoAnn Falletta
There were so many incredible
women who came before us women
who did the real lifting

GOPNIK
Name one

TAR
Okay first and foremost Nadia
Boulanger Thats the happy example
The sad one would be Antonia Brico
who by all accounts was an incredible
conductor but was ghettoized into the
non-glamorous status of guest
conductor and essentially treated as
a dog act

GOPNIK
She never had the opportunity to
conduct a major orchestra

TAR
She did conduct the Berlin Philharmonic
as well as the Met But again only as
a guest conductor At that time it was
all gender spectacle Fortunately
times change The Pauline conversion is
if not complete then evolving nicely

GOPNIK
Words of hope Okay lets talk about
translation Many people think of a
conductor as essentially a human
metronome

TAR
Well thats partly true Keeping
time is no small thing

GOPNIK
But theres much more isnt there

TAR
I hope so yes But time is the
thing Time is the essential piece
of interpretation You cannot start
without me I start the clock My
left hand shapes but my right hand
the second-hand marks time and moves
it forward
TAR (CONTD)
However unlike a clock sometimes my
second-hand stops which means
time stops The illusion is that
like you Im responding to the
orchestra in real-time and making a
decision about the right moment to
restart the thing or reset it or
throw time out the window altogether
The reality is that from the very
beginning I know precisely what
time it is and the exact moment we
will arrive at our destination
together The only real discovery for
me is in the rehearsal never the
performance

GOPNIK
Tough question I know but what was
the most important thing you learned
from Bernstein

TAR
Kavanah its Hebrew for attention
to meaning or intent What are the
composers priorities what are yours

GOPNIK
Kavanah I think many in our
audience may have other
associations with that word

TAR
Yes Id imagine so

GOPNIK
The first conductors on the scene
werent all that important right

TAR
Yes thats right By default it
was the job of the principal
violinist

GOPNIK
When does that change And why

TAR
With the French composer Jean
Baptiste Lully who reportedly used a
rather enormous rather pointy staff
to pound the tempi into the floor
Its not something I imagine the
players particularly appreciated
anyway that technique ended during
a performance when he accidentally
stabbed himself in the foot with the
thing and died of gangrene
TAR (CONTD)

(audience laughs)
But the conductor becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger And
once again we go back to Beethoven

(sings opening of fifth)
Doesnt start with the eighth note
The downbeats silent Someone had
to start that clock Now when that
someone was Lenny the orchestra was
led on the most extraordinary tour
of pleasures He knew the music
Mahler especially as well or
better than anyone And of course
deeply and truly loved it So he
often played with the form He
wanted an orchestra to feel like
theyd never seen let alone heard
or performed any of that music So
hed do radical things like
disregarding the tempo primo and
ending a phrase molto ritardando
even though it had no such marking

GOPNIK
He over-egged it

TAR
No not at all He celebrated the
joy of his discovery

GOPNIK
What about your own discovery You
say this happens in rehearsal

TAR

(nods)
We start Monday However for this
one its really about trying to read
the tea leaves of Mahlers intention
We know a great deal about this with
the other symphonies He was so
inspired by the poetry of Ruckert
that for many years he didnt set
another author to music But all this
changes with the Five The Five is a
mystery The only clue he leaves us
is on the cover of the manuscript
itself The dedication to his new
wife Alma And so if youre going to
partner with Mahler on his fifth
symphony the first thing you must do
is try and understand that marriage

GOPNI
Alright then would you say then
that your understanding of that
marriage is similar to Bernsteins
TAR
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon Well
Adam the Shipibo-Konibo only
receive an icaros or song if the
singer is there on the same side
as the spirit who created it In
this way the past and present
converge The flip sides of the
same cosmic coin That definition
of fidelity makes sense to me But
Lenny believed in teshuvah the
Talmudic power to reach back in
time and transform the significance
of ones past deeds When he played
the Adagietto at Robert Kennedys
funeral it ran twelve minutes He
treated it as a mass and if you
listen to a recording of it you will
no doubt feel the pathos and
tragedy That interpretation was
very true for Mahler later in life
after the professional bottom
dropped out and Alma had abandoned
him for Gropius But as I said
before we are dealing with time
And this piece was not born into
aching tragedy it was born into
young love

GOPNIK
And you chose
TAR
love
GOPNIK

Yes but how long

TAR
(shrugs smiles)
- seven minutes

YOUNG MATRON
I was so taken by what you said about
interpretation
YOUNG MATRON (CONTD)
Specifically in regard to feelings
and the fact that you chose love I
know its said you should leave the
tears for the audience but do you
ever find yourself overwhelmed with
emotion up there on the podium

TAR
It does happen theres an
expectationreward cycle with some
works Spots in them I find so
incredible that when Im conducting
Im not hurrying exactly But I
cant wait to get to that spot and
it does it does it every time

Francesca lurks in Tars periphery Tar tries to ignore her

YOUNG MATRON
So its physical as well as emotional

TAR
Oh it is It can take hours to
return to normal You say things
after that others remember but that
you wont Sleep is impossible

YOUNG MATRON
Like my freshman year at Smith
(noted by Tar)
Which piece really does that to you

TAR
Rite of Spring has eleven pistol-
shots -- a prime number -- that strike

you as both perpetrator and victim
It wasnt until I conducted it that

I became absolutely convinced that
were all capable of murder thats
a fantastic handbag by the way

YOUNG MATRON
Oh thanks Im glad you like it

TAR
I do

FRANCESCA
Excuse me Your lunch with Mr
Kaplan His driver is waiting
Tar with the tiniest glance shoos her away Moves back to YM

TAR
Im sorry Ive forgotten your name

A room of diners adorned in eastern standard regimentals
Corton-Charlemagne is uncorked and poured by ALDO SOHM into
the glass of ELIOT KAPLAN who gives it a brief whiff

ELIOT
Perfect Aldo
(Tar covers her glass)
I was hoping we could celebrate

TAR
So was I but Ive got a class at
Juilliard I promised Ben

ELIOT
Oh goody Im sure youll have a
few elbowing for an Accordion slot

TAR
We should open it up

ELIOT
Expand our numbers

TAR
No our sex It feels quaint to keep
things single-gender Weve made our
point and honestly had no trouble
successfully placing any of them

ELIOT
Yes all but one

TAR
she had issues
ELIOT
So Ive heard The topic is if not
unavoidable then shall we say in
the room at every Citibank meeting
attended by her father

TAR
Im sorry about that

ELIOT
Its fine Not something I cant
handle Alright so you want to
torpedo Accordions founding
principal Wed likely lose donors

TAR
I suppose thats true Maybe its
something to revisit down the line

ELIOT
Bryant Parks locked for the twenty-
fifth Nan asked me to help fill the
place The Kaplan Fund will buy
some radio and outdoor advertising

TAR
And claqueurs Its too big Eliot
She should have booked The Strand

ELIOT
Relax Itll be great and it
almost falls on your birthday

Tar nods bothered by the mention of the approaching date
her periphery bothered by a BRIONI-CLAD MAN dining with a
SHORT MAN at a nearby table who appears to be staring

ELIOT
Im sorry you werent able to make
it to my Mahler three in London

TAR
Me too Petra had a school thing
I promised Sharon Id be there

ELIOT
Of course I was just hoping for
your honest opinion My player
rating sheets were off the charts

TAR
Those are confidential Eliot

ELIOT
(smirks)
The principal oboist is a fan
ELIOT (CONTD)
On the way back I was listening to
yours with the Israeli Phil and
was struck by what you pulled from
the strings in the last movement
How did you get them there Was it
the hall The players

TAR
The players werent very obliging
The principal violinist came up to
me after the first rehearsal and
asked if I was a Jew It seemed to
him unusual and perhaps even
suspicious for a non-Jew to be
interested in conducting Jewish
music I felt like Max Bruch

ELIOT
(laughs)
Well big Jew that I am The Kaplan
Fund has committed a sizable amount
to them for a klezmer commission
Perhaps theyll invite me to guest
conduct the way Berlin did hmm

TAR
Theyd be lucky to have you
ELIOT
Please I know my place money

cant always buy everything

TAR
You dont really believe that

ELIOT
Ill have you know I tried to bribe
Francesca to let me have a look at
your notation and she sent me packing

TAR
Good girl

Mr Brioni is still staring at them Tars bothered now

TAR (CONTD)
That gentleman sitting over there
with the gnome is urgently focused
on our table At first I thought it
might be me he was looking at but I
believe hes got his eye on you

ELIOT
Please try and ignore him
TAR
I can excuse myself and go wash my
hands if youd like to be alone

ELIOT
And Id never forgive you The last
thing I need is to be button-holed
by someone exactly like me What
time are you heading back tomorrow

TAR
Francescas looking into flights

ELIOT
Call her off Leave when you like

TAR
You dont have to do that

ELIOT
My motives are far from altruistic
Just a peek One peek at your
performing score
(she doesnt bite)
Okay fine

TAR
(checks phone)
Would five-fifteen be alright
Ive got to get turned around fast
Were filling a vacant position

ELIOT
Please tell me its Sebastian

TAR
Be fair Eliot Sebastian has
decent technique he has baton

ELIOT
I dropped into Bunkamura to hear the
touring machine trot out Chopin one
last month O1 Sebastian truly is
Mr Tempo-rubato

TAR
Robot-o is more like it

ELIOT
Why do you keep him on

TAR
Hes Andriss man You know that

ELIOT
Yes exactly You inherited that
decision Seven years is a long
time to pretend you respect it

-14-
He smiles

TAR
We have different labor contracts

over there hes an odd guy
ELIOT

Andris
TAR

Sebastian he has fetishes
ELIOT

Fetishes What kind

TAR
Nostalgia for pre-war Kalmus
miniature scores dead-stock
pencils hes seen Karajan hold in
photographs That sort of thing

ELIOT
Ugg Sad
TAR
But youre not wrong at some
point I will need to rotate him
ELIOT
For who
(she ignores question)
Okay What Love Teaches Me

That string notation

TAR
Mahler gives it to you himself
Langsam ruhevoll empfunden
(hes not buying it)
Trust me you dont want to go to
school on someone elses red and blue
pencil least of all mine

ELIOT
Oh but I do
TAR
Youll quit pestering me
(he nods)

Free bowing Not pretty for an
audience to look at but if you can
manage to keep your players out of
the weeds the sound is ferocious

like the cat who ate the canary
TAR (CONTD)

Theres no glory for a robot
Eliot Do your own thing

ONSTAGE AT MORSE RECITAL HALL
MAX conducts a STUDENT ENSEMBLE in rehearsal for Anna
Thorvaldsdéttirs R6 This interrupted by the click click
click of Tars baton striking a stand

TAR (0C)
Alright lets stop here

Tar joins Max at the podium

TAR (CONTD)

Thank you Max for my own
edification why did you come to
Juilliard

MAX
Uh its the best music
conservatory in the country

TAR
People from Curtis Eastman and
others may beg to differ Juilliard
is a brand right Did you come here
to study with a brand

MAX
uh no

TAR
There was a teacher or graduate
somewhere down the line that
conjured something in your
imagination Someone you aspired to
be yourself Who was it

(smiles)
Sarah Chang
TAR
Youre a violinist
MAX
Yes
TAR

(stares at score)
Then I can see why you would choose
to conduct a piece like this There
must be a familiar pleasure in
presiding over a bed of strings
that behave as if theyre tuning

(Max good-naturedly laughs)
This piece is very au courant
TAR (CONTD)
Here the composer tells us to begin
with back and forth tremolo strokes
with wire brush and slowly sliding
crotales over skin Sounds like René
Redzepis recipe for reindeer

Max laughs again

TAR (CONTD)
Exciting to play new music isnt it
(Max nods)
Please join the other fellows

Tar looks out at the seated students

TAR (CONTD)
Now I know youre all conducting
students of Mr Wolfes but how
many of you also study composition
(hands up she selects one)
What is your name

OLIVE KERR
Olive Kerr

TAR
Okay Olive What do you make of
what weve been listening to

OLIVE KERR
Its pretty awesome I mean
theres incredible atonal tension

TAR

(leaves stage)

I agree About the tension part
Now you can intellectually
contemplate or masturbate about
the felicity of the so-called
atonal but the important question
here is what are you conducting
What is the effect What is it
actually doing to me

(heads to where Max sits)
Good music can be as ornate as a
cathedral or as bare as a potting
shed So long as it allows you to
answer both of those questions
What do you think Max

Maxs looks put on the spot as nervous as his bouncing knee
MAX

Uh when Anna Thorvaldsdéottir gave
her Master Class
MAX (CONTD)
She said she was often influenced by
the form and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within But
Im not sure if she was interested
per se in describing those actual
sounds

TAR

Very Punkt Kontra Punkt

(off blank looks moves to

apron of stage and sits)
Yes the intent of her composition is
vague to say the least So if her
intent is vague how do you as a
conductor have a point of view about
anything Now to be fair there are
times when you will simply have no
choice and be made to stand in front
of an orchestra and pretend there are
invisible structures But my prayer
for you is that youll be spared the
embarrassment of standing on a podium
with the four thirty-three trying to
sell a car without an engine Because
now my friends now is the time to
conduct music that actually requires
something from you

(heads back to Max and

takes a seat next to him)
For instance Max Why not a Kyrie

like Bachs Mass in B minor

Im not really into Bach

TAR
Youre not into Bach Oh Max Have
you read the Schweitzer book

MAX
No

TAR

Well you should

feigns a head punch)
Its an important text Antonia
Brico thought so So much so that
she shipped herself to Equatorial
Africa and canoed up the Congo
River to track Schweitzer down and
ask him to teach her what he knew
about Bach somewhere Ive got a
picture of her in a pith helmet
Have you ever played or conducted
Bach
MAX
Honestly as a BIPOC pangender-
person I would say Bachs
misogynistic life makes it kind of
impossible for me to take his music
seriously

TAR
What exactly do you mean by that

MAX
Well didnt he sire like twenty
kids

TAR
Thats documented along with a
considerable amount of music
But Im unclear what his prodigious
skills in the marital bed have to
do with B minor

MAXS KNEE NOW ON OVERDRIVE unignorable and intolerable to
Tar who gets to her feet and heads back up onto the stage

TAR (CONTD)

Okay sure Its your choice A soul
selects her own society But
remember the flip-side of that
selection closes the valves of ones
attention

(pacing now)
Of course siloing whats acceptable
or not acceptable is a construct of
many if not most symphony
orchestras who see it as their
imperial right to curate for the
cretins So slippery as it is
theres some merit in examining
Maxs allergy Can classical music
written by a bunch of straight
Austro-German church-going white
guys exalt us individually as well
as collectively And who may I ask
gets to decide that

(turns back to Max)
What about Beethoven Are you into
him Because for meee As a U-Haul
Lesbian Im not really sure about
ol Ludwig But then I face him and
find myself nose-to-nose with his
magnitude and inevitability

(moves to piano bench)
Max indulge me let us allow Bach a
similar gaze

She gestures Max over to join her at the bench He walks back
up onto the stage and just stands there
TAR (CONTD)
(pats bench)
Sit

She playfully begins the C Major Prelude from Bachs Wel1-
Tempered Clavier She makes a clown face The point being
this piece is so well-known that she knows she must make fun
of the example before anyone else in the room can

TAR (CONTD)
This is all filigree It could be a
first-year piano student or
Schroder playing for Lucy
(she gazes up moon-eyed)
- or Glen Gould for that matter

She Gould-groans and changes the attack Then stops

TAR (CONTD)

Its not until it changes

(she plays the first change)
When you get inside that you see
what it really is A question and
an answer

(plays second change)
That begs another question Theres a
humility in Bach Hes not pretending
hes certain of anything He knows
its the question that involves the
listener Never the answer

(stops)
What do you think Max

MAX
You play really well But
nowadays White male cis
composers Just not my thing

MAXS KNEE starts BOUNCING up and down again TARS HAND
reaches over and stops it

TAR
Dont be so eager to be offended
The narcissism of small differences
leads to the most boring conformity

MAX
I guess Edgar Varése is okay
I mean I like Arcana anyway

Tar leaves stage up the aisle into the rake with the other
fellows leaving Max alone on the piano bench Twenty vs one
TAR

Then you must be aware that Varése
once famously stated that jazz was
a negro product exploited by the
Jews That didnt stop Gerry
Goldsmith from ripping him off for
his Planet of the Apes score

(pacing the rake)
Kind of a perfect insult dont you
think But you see the problem with
enrolling yourself as an ultrasonic
epistemic dissident is if Bachs
talent can be reduced to his gender
birth country religion sexuality
and so on -- then so can yours
Someday Max when you go out into
the world and guest conduct before a
major or minor orchestra you may
notice that the players have more
than lightbulbs and music on their
stands Theyll also have been
handed rating sheets The purpose of
which is to rate u What kind of
criteria would you hope they use to
do this Your score reading and
stick technique or something else

(Max is silent)
Okay everyone Using Maxs
criteria let us consider Maxs
thing In this case Anna
Thorvaldsdottir Now can we agree
upon two pieces of observation
One that Anna was born in Iceland
And two that she is -- in a Waldorf
teacher kind of way -- a super hot
young woman Show of hands

(hands shoot up )
Great Now lets turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there and see
if we can square how any of those
things possibly relate to the
person seated before us

(Max heads for the exit)
Where are you going

MAX
Youre a fucking bitch

TAR
And you are a robot Unfortunately
the architect of your soul appears to
be social media If you want to dance
the mask you must service the
composer Sublimate yourself your
ego and yes your identity You must
in fact stand in front of the public
and God and obliterate yourself

Francesca appraises Tars outfit examining her head-to-toe

FRANCESCA
Jake said he was certain youd be
happy with the drape of the seat

TAR
I will if I can keep the fat off
until next month

FRANCESCA
You never gain weight Your mother
texted me She knows youre busy
but is hoping to drop by

TAR
Next trip

FRANCESCA
What are you thinking for dinner

TAR
Ill stay in and put this piano to
use Im suspicious of that E natural
in the cello line doesnt it sound
like warmed over Charles Ives to you

FRANCESCA
Not at all

Tar plucks a MANUSCRIPT from the table and moves to the piano

TAR
You must have some New Haven friends
youd like to catch up with tonight

FRANCESCA
No not really Should I stop by
later for notes
TAR
That wont be necessary

Tars silence followed by her hand striking a note on the
keyboard makes it clear to Francesca shes been dismissed
She turns then stops and reaches into her bag and retrieves
a tastefully-wrapped BOOK-SIZED PACKAGE

FRANCESCA
I almost forgot This was left for
you at the front desk

TAR
By who
FRANCESCA
They didnt say
TAR
No card
FRANCESCA
No
TAR

Okay thanks just leave it there

FRANCESCA
Goodnight

Francesca sets it down and exits
Tar plays the cello line Working it over again and again
SUITE BATHROOM

Far from settling in for the night Tar stands in front of
the mirror dolling herself up From the other room Jessica
Hansens voice is heard reading NPR program breaks Tar
responds to the distinctive Hansen lilt then imitates her
read Tars eyes satisfied with her mimicry suddenly fill
with concern She turns and looks back into the suite as if
sensing someone or something But theres nothing there

MAYBACH IN THE BATTERY TUNNEL
Francesca and Tar in the back
TAR

(not happy)
When were you informed of this

FRANCESCA
Just this morning Mr Kaplan was
very apologetic I was able to

get us on the seven am you like
through Munich
FRANCESCA (CONTD)
The connections short but special
services are standing by

TAR
Where are things are with DG Tell
me theyve finally woken up to see
the wisdom of honest-to-God LPs for
this release

FRANCESCA
(scans phone)
No movement there yet

TAR
The email I drafted for you--

FRANCESCA
I sent it last night

TAR
Forward me their response
your take on the New Yorker talk

FRANCESCA
it went well I thought

TAR
Youre hedging I was garrulous

FRANCESCA
No not at all

TAR
Francesca if you have any real
interest in conducting then you
need to be able to speak your mind

FRANCESCA
perhaps you could have made
less of the relationship with--

TAR
Lenny
FRANCESCA
No I was thinking about Mahler

and Almas You implied that she
betrayed him and Im not sure
I agree with that

TAR
Oh really

FRANCESCA
Alma was a composer too but Mahler
insisted she stop writing music He
said there was only room for --

24—
TAR
(cutting her off)
One asshole in the house

FRANCESCA
Yes

TAR
But she agreed to those rules No
one made that decision for her
Hashtag rulesofthegame

FRANCESCA (SUBTITLED FRENCH)
If woman has the right to mount the
scaffold she must equally have the
right to mount the tribune

Francesca playfully sticks her tongue out at a gloating Tar

There is an underlying tension between the two The tension
of people who have at times slept together but no longer do

Francescas eyes land on the handle of a familiar red handbag

FRANCESCA
How was your evening

TAR
Uneventful Any of Sharons pills left

FRANCESCA
No but Dr Korovin called these in
(hands her Zitomers sack)
I received another weird email from
Krista How should I reply

TAR
Dont

FRANCESCA
This one felt particularly desperate

TAR (SUBTITLED GERMAN)
Hope Dies Last

AIRCRAFT LAVATORY

Locks the door Purells her hands retrieves the prescription
Takes a pill Returns the bottle to her handbag and returns
with the still-unopened wrapped package

She hesitates then removes the wrapping paper to find a
first edition of Vita Sackville-Wests Challenge

She sits on the closed commode opens the book to the title
page where Wests signature has been crossed out and below
it a repetitive geometric pattern scrawled like a maze
She takes a breath rips the page out stands and tries to
shove it and the book into the trashs very small opening

BACK AT HER SEAT

Working an anagram for Krista The first three traiks
straik kraits She puzzles out at risk

TARS HOME

She arrives in the middle of night and habitually begins
turning off LIGHTS left on EVERYWHERE

Stops when she sees the light on at the end of the far hallway
where a woman paces back and forth

LIBRARY SITTING ROOM
She enters to find SHARON GOODNOW pacing in her underwear
SHARON
The flutters back Its racing I
cant find my Metoprolol anywhere
Tar immediately heads to

THE BATHROOM

Takes the bottle from her bag taps out a pill and noisily
closes the medicine cabinet before returning to

THE SITTING ROOM

TAR
This was lying loose on the
counter Is it the right one

Sharon looks at it nods and swallows it

SHARON
Thank you is that a new bag

TAR
A gift from Eliot Do you want it

SHARON
(sits catches breath)
- ho suits you

Tar moves to her office slips an LP from a cover adorned with
a mushroom cloud and places it on a TURNTABLE

TAR
Lets slow things down to sixty
beats a minute

She takes Sharon into her arms and they slow dance to the
Basie Band playing Neal Heftis Lil Darlin
SHARON

last night and again at the hotel

TAR
Must of been asleep

SHARON
You never sleep that deeply

TAR
Dont be a scold
(sings softly)
When I get to feelin’ a feelin
For something there aint too much of
My sweet lil

SHARON
Im worried about Petra Shes
starting to disappear into herself

TAR
Be specific

SHARON
She keeps coming home with bruises
on her shins and when I ask her
about it she gets quiet I hope its
just playground football and not a
Biodeutsche thing

TAR
we talked about this

SHARON
maybe we just need to put more
effort into finding her a friend
Last year was so hard To be locked
up alone with two old ladies like us

TAR
shes old enough now to begin
piano lessons Ill teach her

SHARON
Yes that might be good

TAR
Hows your heart

SHARON

They keep share a tender kiss

darlin gives me her love
NEXT MORNING

The clock radio clicks on Tar wakes alone to the classical
station playing the final movement of Shostakovichs Symphony
no 5 Percussion driving the screaming brass

TAR
(to self)
Knock knock whos there

Walter Lenny No its you MTT

Why do you insist on holding things
up like that Your business here is
rejoicing Not screaming like a
fucking porn star

It ends The DJ confirms that its in fact Michael Tilson Thomas
BATHROOM — LATER

Tar at the mirror the foreground dirties she quickly turns
to find PETRA her six-year-old adopted Syrian daughter

TAR
Hello Petra Why are you lurking
(Petra is silent)
Tell me and I will help
SHARONS OFFICE
Tar now holding Petras hand peeks in to Sharon

TAR
Sharon Im driving Petra to school

TAR (PRE-LAP)
Wholl bear the pall

IN TARS TAYCAN
Tar driving Petra in better spirits
PETRA
We said the Wren Both the coc
and the hen well bear the pall
TAR
Wholl sing a psalm
PETRA

I said the Thrush As she sat
on a bush ‘Ill sing a psalm

TAR
Wholl toll the bell

PETRA
I said the bull because I
can pull Ill toli the bell
TOGETHER
All the birds of the air fell
a-sighing and a-sobbing when
they heard the bell toll for
poor Cock Robin

OUTSIDE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN CHARLOTTENBURG

Tar stands by the Taycan scanning the other CHILDREN and
PARENTS while Petra struggles into her knapsack

TAR
Which one is she

Petra looks around and points to a KNOT of GIRLS clustered
around JOHANNA a perfect blond Aryan child in a red jacket

PETRA
the red one

TAR
Okay Go on in

Tar watches Petra head up the stairs to the entrance As soon
as shes safely inside Tar pivots » walks over to the girls
and crouches down in front of the red-coated blond child

TAR (SUBTITLED GERMAN)
Hello Johanna Im Petras father
Shes told me a lot about you

The other girls share complicit looks before drifting away
Johanna in a state of surprise just stands there frozen

TAR (SUBTITLED GERMAN) (CONTD)

I know what youre doing to her

And if you ever do it again do

you know what Ill do Ill get you

And if you tell any grown-ups what I
just said -- they wont believe you
Because Im a grown-up But you need to
believe me I will get you Remember
this Johanna God watches all of us

Her intensity terrifies the child Tar gets up and walks away
Johanna watches as Tar crosses the street approaches her car
and gives a friendly wave to an arriving parent

BERLIN ORCHESTRA HALL BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER

Tar on the move exchanges greetings and handshakes with
behind-the-scene hands of the orchestra Francesca waits

with Purell

FRANCESCA
Theyre already in the chamber hall

Tar shakes her head and heads into the
LADIES ROOM

Washing her hands like a surgeon 60 BPM HEEL STRIKES bring
her gaze to the MIRROR in time to see an attractive YOUNG
WOMAN disappear into a STALL

Tar dries her hands and starts out but curiosity gets the
best of her She squats

To PEER under the stall taking note of the young womans
BOOTS

CHAMBER HALL

Tar enters and observes Sharon who we will come to know as the
Concertmaster whispering to one of the FOUR playerauditors

Tar approaches the auditors table and an older man SEBASTIAN
BRIX (70 Assistant Conductor) stands and she takes his place

SEBASTIAN
(nervously clicks pen)
Im sorry Maestro we werent sure
you were coming We were told there
might be a scheduling conflict

She smiles tightly and cocks an eyebrow at Sharon who shrugs

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Would you like me to take notes

TAR
(reaches out to stop clicking)
Thank you Sebastian but that
wont be necessary

Sebastian looking a bit glum shuffles to the back

TAR (CONTD)
Do we all have our rating sheets
I see youve narrowed it to three
Unless anyone has other business to
discuss lets bring in number one

She looks to Francesca who slips behind a SCREEN We hear the
noises-off entrance of someone taking their seat behind it

A SERIES OF JUMP CUTS

Take us through THREE UNSEEN PLAYERS solo auditions As the
last player finishes their piece we glimpse Tars audit
sheet and the 1 thru 5 category checks for all three players

60 BPM HEEL STRIKES exiting the room make her glance up
toward the screen before returning to her sheet to adjust it
INSIDE THE SAVOY HAVANA BAR

Where ANDRIS DAVIS 82 is known and still feels like a big
deal The walls adorned with framed BandW photos of famous dead
people Other than Marlene Deitrich nearly all are white
males of classical music Among them Furtwangler and Karajan
Tar hates the place and pokes at a salad while listening to
old man stories hoping she never becomes such a creature

ANDRIS
Goosens stands sounds his A Léon of
course was famous for his rather wide
vibrato and so Beecham looks up and
says Gentleman take your pick
(she laughs politely)
Hows the writing going

TAR
I never know how to answer that
question It makes it sound like a
physical act Like hows the
shitting going

ANDRIS
Okay hows the thinking going

TAR
Not so well I keep hearing
something and getting excited only
to catch myself in pastiche

ANDRIS
Its all pastiche We all have the
same musical grammar Just look at
Beethoven Five The third movements
theme has the same sequence of
intervals as the opening theme of the
final movement of Mozart forty

TAR
That could have been coincidence

ANDRIS
Not in this case If you examine the
sketchbooks he used twenty-nine
bars of Mozarts finale appear
copied out by Beethoven

TAR
I find that extremely depressing

ANDRIS
I finished reading your manuscript
Its very good Lydia One for the
ages and I dare say will be
available long after my book has
been forgotten
TAR
Youre right The entire first
printing will always be available

ANDRIS
Too modest as usual

He produces an ENVELOPE from his pocket and hands it to her
She frees a slip of typewritten paper reads it and smiles

TAR
Thank you Andris Ill cherish this

ANDRIS
(waves hand)
You may use it
(Tar looks confused)

A blurb for the cover
TAR
(uncomfortable)

Oh thank you Ill send it to
the publisher hopefully theres
still time

ANDRIS
Im proud to say you were my pupil
Even though there was really
nothing I could teach you

TAR
Thats not true Id never have the
position here were it not for you

ANDRIS
Then youd be in London or New York

TAR
Theyre not Berlin Besides Im
not sure what Sharon would do if we
were ever to leave Shes so close
with her family

ANDRIS
Ah yes the Goodnow sisters I
remember that older one being an
absolute ballbuster when she still
held sway at DG

TAR
Heika is a woman of many opinions
And that voice The signal-to-noise
ratio is unbearable Ive had to bolt-
hole at my old place in town to get
any writing done
ANDRIS
Schopenhauer measured a persons
intelligence against their
sensitivity to noise

TAR
Didnt he also famously throw a
woman down a flight of stairs who
later sued him

ANDRIS
Yes though its unclear that this
private and personal failing is at
all relevant to his work

OUTSIDE THE SAVOY

Tar stands with Andris His CAR arrives the driver gets out
to open the door for Andris but Tar waves him off

TAR
Youre late

TAR ENTERS HER OLD CHARLOTTENBERG APT

And begins a ritual that involves candles and breath There
are three frames on the wall a 1912 PORTRAIT of the German
mathematician David Hilbert A DRAWING of his curve in its
sixth configuration And a BandW photo of a 24-year-old Tar
whose face is painted with a Kené pattern as is the tribal
elder of the Shipibo-Konibo shaman who emits smoke onto her

She hangs her coat kicks off her shoes picks out score
shes composing We may glimpse the redhead in BG out of
focus We move with Tar L to R She finds the sheet she wants
and turns back to work table but there is no one there She
adjusts the notation and carries the sheet over to the
piano takes a seat and plays a phrase She stops and turns
as if someone might be sneaking up on her She brushes her
shoulders and repeats woosh-breaths to escape the feeling

LATER

In the kitchen she pours herself some tea A faint repetitive
TWO-TONE ELECTRONIC CHIME catches her attention She sets her
cup down Heads back into the

APARTMENT COMMON ROOM

Stops and stands listening Unsure if she still hears it or
if its the memory of an irritant She hums the tones Moves
to the piano and finds the interval

BENEATH AN S-BAHN TRESTLE
On her daily run passing all manner of wild posts that

include images of herself facing off with Mahler as if
promising a live V prizefight between the two of them
34-

LIETZENSEE PARK
She moves along the lake shore and into
LANGGRASWIESE

Stops to catch her breath Her ears prick to something like
WOOD CRACKING followed by A WOMAN CRYING IN TERROR and or
AGONY She scans the middle-distance for the source

SPRINTS TO THE LIKELY AREA OF THE SOUND
Cutting across meadowland to a

COPSE OF TREES but doesnt see anything The scream grows
distant but at the same time more terrifyingly desperate

SHE LIES AWAKE IN BED
The sound still echoing in her head
TARS OLD CHARLOTTENBERG APARTMENT

AT THE PIANO working over the thing shes writing she stops
niggled by something That FAINT two-tone interval Something
electronic but at a remove as if coming through the wall

She stands
PEEKS INTO THE HALL Nothing Shuts the door

AT THE PIANO she plucks out the interval rests her chin in
her hand and using only her index finger continues the
electronic interval letting it naturally progress to bars 15-
17 of Trauermarsch like a child playing around singing it
until she reaches bar 18 when she uses both hands for the
crashing chords of this and bar 19

GROSSER SAAL - MAHLER V MOVEMENT I TRAUERMARSCH BAR 20 TO 34

Tar leading a rehearsal The sonic power of one of the worlds
greatest orchestras with players from across the globe Tar
addresses them mostly in English This is where we see the
why and how of who she is The art of the particular The
discipline The only real reason that people put up with her
A SERIES OF STARTS and STOPS

TAR
Alright Good Back to one Remember
that sforzando on the whole note
attached to the eighth must be
strict But also as if were hearing
it from a great distance Ta Ta Ta
kaaa Ta Ta Ta kaaa Ta Ta Ta kaaaaaa

She looks around Squints into the auditorium Calls out
TAR (CONTD)
Is Harald nearby

We HEAR a mans voice answer her back over a LOUDSPEAKER

TAR (CONTD)
Great I wonder if you might
quickly rig something up for us

MOMENTS LATER - TRAUERMARSCH BAR 1 TO 13

The FIRST CHAIR TRUMPET stands backstage horn raised
staring at a MONITOR displaying TAR ON THE PODIUM hands
gesturing the downbeat and he attacks the triplets The view
ADJUSTS to include the OPEN STAGE DOOR and Tar on the podium
beyond The distance achieves the desired effect

TAR
Good good wonderful
(stops them at bar 13)
Harald Well want this same set-up

TAR

SECOND MOVEMENT STURMISCH BEWEGET BAR 16 TO 33

TAR
However much you move your heads

Looks great but we need to hear it

A small squabble between TWO VIOLINISTS

TAR (CONTD)

(stops it by tapping baton)
Okay twenty-seven Strings alone
Now remember Before the
transition Its got to be like a
shot

STURMISCH BEWEGET BAR 27 TO 31

TAR (CONTD)

STURMISCH BEWEGET BAR 30

Sharon perfectly demonstrates what Tars after Satisfied
Tar allows the strings to continue then stops them

TAR (CONTD)
Okay tutti Two before with the
upbeat on bar 29

POST REHEARSAL - RECORDING BOOTH

Tar drops in and is greeted from behind a bank of monitors
and sliders by HARALD Chief LightingVideo Technician
and CHRISTIAN Chief Sound Mixer

TAR
How are things feeling up here

CHRISTIAN

BLOCK K - MOMENTS LATER

Tar in an aisle seat making notes Sharon and Francesca
seated nearby Sebastian stands in Tars immediate periphery
waiting to be summoned Tar bothered finally nods him over

SEBASTIAN

(squats whispers)
One small thing Maestro During the
scherzo the clarinet solo is a bit
too loud It really should be an
accompanying figure to the first
violins -- but other than that Id
say were in very good shape

He nervously CLICKS his BALLPOINT PEN
TAR
Thank you Sebastian

He exits She watches him ascend the stairs

TAR (CONTD)
Accurate assessment

SHARON
No I dont think so The clarinet
is marked p and were marked pp

TAR
Francesca

FRANCESCA
Sebastian likes to sit in the
stalls —- theres no problem with
the balance in the circle Its
going to sing in the hall

CONCERT HALL — MOMENTS LATER

They now sit with a photographer KARL and a stylist
TANYA making a presentation using examples of past work
Come-hither images of Lola Astonova Janine Jansen and
Natalie Cleina A color-me interesting DG cover of Vikingur
Olafsson and a super-serious image of Anu Tali

KARL
Oh and here is something super
playful Tanya and I did with Gustavo

Tar nods pretending to appreciate these stomach-turners

TAR
Really wonderful work Karl But
Im wondering if we might try
something a little less considered

MOMENTS LATER

Francesca stands with Karl and Tanya looking at Tar in the
overly-considered pose she lifted from the Abbado album

FRANCESCA
(to Karl)
Something simple like this Im not
sure how you would want to light it

TAR
Have Harald dim to half

FRANCESCA
(into walkie)
House lights down half please
LIGHTS DIM Tar briefly lifts her eyes from the prop of her
open score and senses someone watching her Her gaze finds

BLOCK G

Where Olga sits staring at her Tar doesnt break her gaze
Finally Olga stands and exits Tar smiles to herself and
catches Francesca watching both Tar and the exiting Olga

PRINCIPAL CONDUCTORS OFFICE

Tar enters to find Knut Braun the clarinet player from the
audition He stands and Tar gestures him to sit again

TAR
Thank you for waiting

KNUT
Of course Maestro How are you
feeling about todays rehearsal

Tar smiles A moment then

TAR
Sebastian thinks your clarinet solo
in the scherzo is too loud

KNUT
its possible

TAR
I dont agree Your dynamic marking is
higher than that of the first violin

KNUT
Yes thats true

TAR
Sebastian is getting old Knut
Im rotating him out Youre the
first to know

KNUT
Oh well then I will organize
a caucus and we will take a vote

TAR
No you wont

KNUT
A vote must be taken

TAR
Im familiar with the electoral
conclave But the appointment of
the assistant conductor is entirely
my decision
Knut considers this then nods

TAR
Then I can count on your support
with the others

KNUT
Yes Who will you replace him with

TAR
Im looking at several possible
candidates The main thing is that
we move forward immediately

KNUT
I understand Maestro the
players would like to know if you
have chosen the companion piece

TAR (SUBTITLE)
Soon I promise

SHE RUNS THE TUNNEL
Connecting the lakes of Lietzensee Park and out into
THE RAIN CLIMBING A RISE TO AN OUTDOOR ZEITUNGSSTAND

Rifles the CULTURE SECTIONS of NATIONAL NEWS MAGAZINES
looking for any possible reference to herself A sharp
WHISTLE turns her attention to the HAND that shoots from the
kiosk holding DER SPIEGEL She moves to the MAN inside the
kiosk holding it She takes it from him tries to pay but he
waves her off

TARS HOME STUDY — LATER

A page containing a photo and story about Tar are carefully
removed from the magazine placed into a box labeled
sundries and slid into the back recess of a credenza

Tar grabs a Blackwing 602 and Caran dAche red and blue
correction pencil from a cabinet of working supplies

GRAZE THE SHELVES for spine-titled boxes containing Tars
performance scores She retrieves the Mahler V moves to the
piano and opens it Plays the opening triplet Closes it
shoves it to the side grabs her composition and plays the
cello line Working it over again and again

She plays it once more changes the A to an F Doesnt move
during the pedaled decay Then plucks out

TAR (CONTD)
But how strange the change From
major to minor
—40—

She exhales closes her eyes and smiles at a private memory
Her eyes jolt open she turns to see Francesca in the doorway

FRANCESCA
Im sorry I knocked but no one
answered I knew you wanted your
keys back as quickly as possible

TAR
Thank you Did you use the company
card
(Francesca nods)
Great use it for your taxi home
(Francesca doesnt move)
You can go

FRANCESCA

Um It wasnt just the keys I

need I need someone to hold me
TAR

This isnt the place Francesca
FRANCESCA

Youre thats not I just got

this from someone over at Accordion

She offers her phone to Tar who looks at the screen

TAR

Oh no when did this happen
FRANCESCA

Day before yesterday That email

she sent you it felt like--
TAR

(cutting her off)
Delete it and the rest No reason to
get caught up in any intrigue

Francesca turns away fighting emotion Tar stands and takes
the young woman into her arms cooing and trying to calm her

TAR (CONTD)
Now now its sad I know But
theres nothing we could have done
to stop her She wasnt one of us

FRANCESCA
I cant stop thinking about our
trip up the Ucayali the three

of us were so

TAR
Yes that was before she started
making demands Something wasnt
right with her
-41-—

FRANCESCA
she had so much promise

TAR
(steps back from her)
Yes she did Almost as much as you
Its best we forget about her You
understand right

Theres an implicit threat in this last line
FRANCESCA
Im sorry I know youre working
(leaves room)

Your keys are on the kitchen table
Tar listens to her footfalls then moves to her laptop
Launches MAIL clicks SENT FOLDER searches Krista Taylor
GLIMPSE email headers from both major and minor orchestras
CHECKERBOARD letters of inquiry with Tars responses WORDS
string together to form a single damning sentence I must warn
you of the danger to your orchestra in hiring Ms Taylor
She highlights and deletes the entire list
LATER - TAR SOAKS IN THE SHOWER
Working something over
IN THE GREAT ROOM NOW

Looking out at the night sky Sharon enters pours both some
wine and sits

SHARON
She went straight to sleep I didnt
even have to hold her foot And she
came home in a much better mood

TAR

Atta girl
SHARON

I met the new cellist today
TAR

What was that like
SHARON

Olga Metkina Russian Strong player
TAR

Oh good
SHARON

Her facial posture is a bit much
—42—

TAR
How so

SHARON
Her legato It looks like shes on
the verge of climaxing

TAR
(sits)
Well shes young

SHARON
Ah so youve met her

TAR
Francesca mentioned something
Shes arranging a welcome lunch

SHARON
You may want to hold off on that
Her invitation is conditional

TAR
You have reservations

SHARON
No not really but we need to see
if she fits in

TAR
Did you take your pill

SHARON
(stands)
No Thank you for reminding me

LATER

Sharon and Tar sound asleep Three seconds of silence
followed by the tick-tock-tick-tock of 120 beats per minute
Tar wakes rises and leaves the bedroom to investigate
HALLWAY

The SOUND louder she moves to her

HOME STUDY

Follows the sound to the pencil supply door opens it the
recess empty save for her METRONOME She stops the arm picks
up the cover to replace it and stops when she notices

A maze-like pattern drawn in blue pencil on the inside of the
lid The pattern inked onto the title page of the book she
received and disposed of in the airplane lavatory

A trace of recognition crosses her eyes She kills the light
43

IN THE TAYCAN — MOVING

TAR
How was Johanna yesterday

PETRA
she stays away now
TAR
Let me know if that changes Petra
last night were you by any chance

drawing in the closet of my study

PETRA
No Lydia Im not supposed to go
into that room without you

TAR
Yes thats right

Tars eyes find the PASSENGER AIR VENT its louvers making a
rattling SOUND Something seems to have come loose

FOURTH MOVEMENT ADAGIETTO BAR 37 TO 42

TAR
No no no Its got to be messier
Not so simple It needs to sound like
violins and cellos but also horns
Because Mahler doesnt give us any here
Long bow strokes Lots of pressure

Her right hand holds her baton like a violin her left index
finger acts as a bow moving across and bending it

TAR (CONTD)
Forget Visconti Its so familiar
to everyone It really doesnt help
to know this piece so well

ADAGIETTO BAR 58 TO 64

TAR (CONTD)

(at Bar 60)
Nur ein kleines crescendo Jetzt
die Terz durchlassen (Just a little
crescendo now let the third come
through)

(stops them at 64)
Bitte Sie mussen mich anschauen
Das ist ganz frei hier (Please you
must watch Its completely free
here) Its got to be like one
person singing their heart out

HER EYES for the first time MEET with those of OLGA METKINA
The energy immediate and electric Bordering on uncomfortable
—44—

Tar dumbstruck averts her gaze Sharon catches this

TAR (CONTD)
and youre playing like an--uh
exercise Once again from the top of
the Adagietto

Tar removes the band from her ponytail shaking her hair out
SEBASTIANS OFFICE

Exactly as described by Tar to Eliot Ye Olde Curiosity Shop
A KNOCK at the door has Sebastian look up from his lunch

SEBASTIAN
Come in

Tar enters and closes the door Sebastian hurries to move his
FOOD TRAY to a side table

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Maestro what a surprise I was
just having a bit of lunch Can I
offer you anything

TAR
No thank you

SEBASTIAN
Some tea then

TAR
No thank you Sebastian

She sits folds her hands uncomfortably eyes the BALLPOINT
on the table in front of him then makes a show of taking in
the packed walls and shelves full of totems and memorabilia

TAR (CONTD)
I forget sometimes how impressive
your collection is here Is that
Kalinnikov

He beams and moves to the shelves She takes this opportunity
to snatch his ballpoint pen and hide it under her leg

He hefts a SMALL BRONZE HEAD and carries it over to her

SEBASTIAN
Yes isnt he marvelous He belongs
in a museum I rescued him for a
hundred rubles from a Kiev street
fair back in ninety Right after
the wall came down

TAR
(examines bust)
That must have really been something
SEBASTIAN
Oh incredible to have lived
through it Id only just arrived
here with Andris Suddenly the
impossible was possible

TAR
Id like to talk about that

SEBASTIAN
The reunification

TAR
No The possibility of you fronting
a subscription orchestra

SEBASTIAN
But I already do

TAR
Yes but not as a Kapellmeister
If not now then when Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
- you mean leave Berlin

TAR
Well rotate somewhere yes

SEBASTIAN
But this is my home

TAR

Our only home is the podium We all
live out of a suitcase You know
that as well as anyone

(stands to leave)
Think about it Take youre time
Its not something you need to
decide now

SEBASTIAN
its the girl isnt it

TAR
What girl

SEBASTIAN
Youre not asking Youre telling
I knew as soon as she showed up that
my days here were numbered Andris
told me not to worry but I knew

TAR
Im sure I dont know what youre
talking about

-45—
SEBASTIAN
Oh please Just because no one
dares breathe it we know the things
you do The little favors you grant

—46—

Tar shakes her head Looks away and feigns disappointment

Sebastian

TAR
I really dont know what to say
Sebastian You of all people have
the temerity to question my integrity

looks scared He knows hes gone too far

SEBASTIAN
Im sorry Im sorry
Maestro I dont know what Im
saying I just I just
TAR

No its clear you know exactly
what youre saying And if thats
how you really feel about me
wouldnt you say that staying is
entirely out of the question

SEBASTIAN
(pleading)
Please Maestro please forgive me

TAR
For what Your obsequiousness your
hypocrisy your misogamy

SEBASTIAN
I am not a misogynist

TAR
Mis-og-amy — a hatred of marriage
Andris is still very much married and
you occupy an apartment on the same
floor dont you

The man looks horrified

TAR and SHARONS KITCHEN

They share kitchen clean-up duties

TAR
I just dont like what hes implying
It could lead to more than Chinese
whispers

SHARON
I know we barely survived Der
Spiegel when you and I came out
together
-47—

SHARON (CONTD)
But with Francesca no one could
point their finger its not like
you two are in a relationship

TAR
true But it turns my stomach to
think that the old robot would be
right about something Im sure
hes already run to Andris

SHARON
Well is there someone other than
Francesca you feel is more qualified

TAR
There are others equal to the task

SHARON
- maybe wait to decide

PRINCIPAL CONDUCTORS OFFICE — NEXT DAY

Tar looking a bit haggard blinking her eyes to stay awake as
she shops the CAMI website for conducting and concertmaster
clients A KNOCK at her door She shuts her laptop

TAR
Yes

Francesca enters with a FRUIT PLATE and sets it up for Tar

TAR (CONTD)
Where are we with DG

FRANCESCA
I spoke to an assistant in Boyd
Muirs office who said they werent
sure why they decided on a digital-
only set what the criteria were
I do know they just did a full vinyl
pressing for Long Yu

TAR
Of course they did The Chinese
market is incredible alright

Gloves off Im going straight to
Lucian Maybe he needs to be reminded
about his Annenberg Inclusion Initiative
Youve got his contact details right
(Francesca nods pulls them up

my machine is misbehaving Ive
called IT In the meantime let me
borrow yours

Francesca retrieves it sets it in front of Tar unlocks it
—48—
TAR (CONTD)
Thank you Wheres the matcha
Francesca hesitates for the tiniest moment then leaves
FRANCESCAS SCREEN

Tar launches mail searches Krista Taylor Dozens of emails
still appear in the timeline

Tar looks disappointed then absolutely furious
Shes about to quit out but instead opens the latest email
TAR BOXING

Taking her frustration out on her SPARRING PARTNERs gloves
Working herself into a lather

PRINCIPAL CONDUCTORS OFFICE

She arrives back to find Francesca on the couch texting
A PAPER TAKE-AWAY CUP on the table in front of her

FRANCESCA
I wasnt sure where you were
TAR
(stretching)
Working out a kink
FRANCESCA
(stands)

The matchas cold Ill get another

TAR
Thats alright I dont need it
Lets keep working

Tar takes a seat at her work table pretends to busy herself

TAR (CONTD)
Francesca You did as I asked and
deleted any and all correspondence
with Krista correct

Francesca knows that there is no safe way to answer If she
makes an excuse there will be pain If she lies and Tar has
been snooping things will be much worse perhaps even fatal

FRANCESCA
Im not sure I11 double-check

TAR
(unreadable)
Sebastian is leaving us
-49—

TAR (CONTD)
And Im wondering if you wouldnt
mind compiling a list of suitable
replacements

The light leaves Francescas eyes After awhile she nods

TAR (CONTD)
Of course please feel free to
include your own name

FRANCESCA
(brightens some)
Thank you
(smartphone tings)
Your lunch with the new cellist

TAR
I meant to have you reschedule that
until the orchestra votes

FRANCESCA
Ill text her now

TAR
- ho wait
(stands)
Might as well see what shes made of

Francesca doesnt look the least bit surprised
ZUR LETZTEN INSTANZ

In stark contrast to Andris clubby let-us-now-praise-famous-
men hang this old world eatery has seen it all and is not
impressed by anyone

Tar watching Olga looking over the menu and breaking into the
unguarded smile of a child then laughing

OLGA
This food

TAR
The cucumber salad is very good
Its kind of the only real option at
this place if youre a vegetarian
Do you eat fish

OLGA
Not really

TAR
We can go somewhere else Like the
Store Kitchen Kind of a silly
tradition that new members are
brought here to sup with ghosts of
the past
TAR (CONTD)
At some point everyone from
Napoleon to Beethoven tucked into a
meal at one of these tables

OLGA
Yes and Clara Zetkin
(looks around)
I wonder which one

TAR
Whos that A musician

OLGA
No She helped found social-
democratic womens movement in
Germany And KPD until Hitler came
to power and she was exiled to
Soviet Union

TAR
Clara Zetkin

OLGA
Yes Every March eighth we place
flowers at her plaque in Kremlin
Wall Necropolis

TAR
Her birthday

OLGA
(as if to a child)
No International Womens Day

Tar feeling outclassed by a long-dead woman and out-educated
by the one seated across from her

The waiter appears

WAITER
Ready Maestro

OLGA
(beats Tar to it)
Yes first shashlik then veal

TAR
cucumber salad Thank you

FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

Tar watches Olga savor each bite of meat closing her eyes
humming to herself her eyes open and catch Tar watching her

OLGA
Is good Would you like a bite
TAR
No thank you have you lived in
Berlin long

OLGA
No not at all I have friends in
Neuk6élln I visit until I know
decision of orchestra

TAR
Simonov will hold your place

OLGA
Yes I think so He is my uncle
But my dream has always been to
play with Berlin

TAR
Me too Theres no place like it
I imagine Rostropovich is a hero
of yours

OLGA
Of course he was great we study him
at Moscow Conservatory But growing
up my favorite is Jacqueline du
Pre She made me want to play cello

TAR
Which record was it

OLGA
Not record YouTube Elgar
Concerto

TAR
With Barenboim conducting the
London Philharmonic

OLGA
I dont know who was conducting But
she did something to me Thats when
I decide to learn piece and play it
with youth orchestra

TAR
Quite a challenge How old were you
OLGA
Thirteen
TAR
Wow Id love to hear it
OLGA

(focused on next bite)
They make video I will text to you
Tar watches this young womans impressive appetite somewhat
envious of her utter lack of fear and any kind of pretense
She picks at her cucumber salad wishing for something else

THE MOSCOW YOUTH ORCHESTRA — SEVEN YEARS AGO

The moderato leading to the cadenza of Elgars Cello Concerto
Downstage center sits a THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD OLGA looking very
much like a young du Pré and like du Pré the smiling free-
spirited intelligence displayed at lunch in stark contrast
with the single-minded ferocity of the young girl on display
here Leaving the viewer and Tar somewhat breathless

TAR WATCHING THIS AT THE CHARLOTTENBERG APARTMENT
Her attraction transposed into a kind of awe and respect

The moment interrupted by the muted ELECTRONIC TWO-TONE
interval heard before Tar grimaces wondering where its
coming from It stops She looks relieved then turns her
attention back to the girl on screen Theres a SHARP KNOCK
on the door She looks up annoyed

THE DOOR OPENS

To a portly pale woman dressed in a rumpled black pantsuit and
orthopedic shoes Dirty parted-hair combed tightly to her head
around a face whose lack of exposure to the sun makes it hard to
discern whether she is 40 or 60 This is ELEANOR Developmentally
disabled and at the moment extremely desperate

TAR
Yes

ELEANOR (GERMAN SUBTITLED)
My mothers paper arrives each morning
at six Its missing Do you have it

TAR
No

ELEANOR
This you are sure

TAR
(closes door)
Yes Im sorry
MIDDLE OF NIGHT
Tar wakes to a TONE emanating within in the house
IN THE KITCHEN

She moves to the refrigerator opens the door the tone
stops Her back tenses She turns

But no ones there
S-BAHN TRESTLE

Running now as if somethings behind her

— DIMINUENDO LEADING TO THE FINAL PEDAL A OF THE ADAGIETTO —
FRANCESCA IN THE BACK OF GROSSER SAAL

Listening to the last bars of the ADAGIETTO she appears to
have quite a bit on her mind

ADAGIETTO BAR 98 TO END

Tar conducting She looks exhausted She closes the iris
Allows the decay then smiles

TAR
Very nice indeed Lets leave it
here Tomorrow well begin with the
Rondo-Finale

(players begin packing up)
Before we break I know many of you
are curious what the companion piece
will be Ive been thinking quite a
bit about it and wondering if we
might take an informal poll about
possibly pairing five with the Elgar
Cello Concerto

Tars eyes flick to the surprised eyes of Olga

Then Sharons who closes hers and begins a solemn process
followed by the other players who sit in silence

Listening in their head to what this might smell like A
HAND beating time against a leg the NOD of a head comparing
Elgars theme with that of Mahlers

Tar watching this arcane process something timeless and yet
strange too a kind of group hypnosis

One smile then another The first BOW raises followed by a
SECOND and THIRD Tar watches the forest grow denser until
its fully matured

TAR (CONTD)
Wonderful Elgar it is Would
anyone object if the soloist came
from within our own ranks

THE CELLO SECTION places their attention squarely on the
First Principal Cellist GOSIA PROBOZ who smiles Bows
gently tap on music stands

TAR (CONTD)
Okay and one more question And
this is really just for you Gosia
(Gosia looks up expectedly)
—54—

TAR (CONTD)
As a practical matter this task
would normally fall to you

(Gosia nods)

But given how much will be asked of
you for the Mahler I wonder if
you would be at all bothered if we
were to hold auditions

The cellist looks uncomfortable Tars put her in an
impossible position Not lost on anyone present

GOSTIA
Well that is a bit unorthodox
but in theory I have no objection
My only hesitation would depend on
when these auditions might take
place I wouldnt want them in any
way to interfere with our sectionals

TAR
Good point It must be a sprint
How about this coming Monday

GOSIA
alright

TAR
Knut please assemble a quorum for
Monday All section players welcome
Tar purposefully ignores Olgas gaze

Gosia catches Sharons eye The two section leaders
uncomfortable with what just happened

LATER TAR STRIDES UP THE AISLE - 120 BPM

And greets BRITTA MENGES The two have a proper and
professional working relationship

TAR
Britta
BRITTA
Lydia
(they sit)

Just caught the end

TAR
What do you think Hows it sounding

BRITTA
Fantastic I cant wait until the
live recording concert

TAR
Ill be happy when its over
BRITTA
Its always that way I know youre
busy and I dont want to add to your
load but Andris Davis phoned

TAR
Hes upset Im rotating Sebastian

BRITTA
No something else But youll
please let Laura know as soon as
youve chosen his replacement so
she can prepare a press release

TAR
Of course What did he want

BRITTA
To complain about the punctuality
of the driver he seems to believe
the board supplies him with Do you
know anything about this

TAR
Yes Its something I pay for

BRITTA
Then why does he believe its the
board

TAR

Because he needs to believe that
Needs to believe he hasnt been
forgotten Britta The academy has
von Karajans name on it There are
love shrines to Abbado all over
this place But the name Davis is
essentially nowhere to be seen

BRITTA
(unhappy with the lie)
alright Then perhaps Francesca
could have a word with the driver

TAR
(stands)
Of course
BRITTA
One other thing its unpleasant
TAR

An operational shortfall
(sits back down)

Must I take Mrs Sewing out for

drinks again
BRITTA
No it has nothing to do with the
orchestra Do you remember an
Accordion Academy fellow named
Krista Taylor

TAR
(pretends to search)
oh yes Why

BRITTA
Apparently she committed suicide

Tar slumps forward as if hearing this news for the first time

TAR
Oh God Poor thing her parents
wait Im confused Britta
Why have you been put in the
position to deliver this terrible
news Why didnt Accordion contact
me directly

BRITTA
Its delicate Lydia Mr Kaplan
thought it might be best if you
contacted a lawyer before speaking
with anyone at Accordion

TAR
presumably that anyone
including Eliot himself
Why would I need to do that

BRITTA
Apparently some accusations have
been made

TAR
What kind of accusations

BRITTA
He didnt say But they were
brought to Accordions counsel
Mr Kaplan said he is certain
nothing will come of it but one
cant be too careful

Tar looks furious but also frightened
PRINCIPAL CONDUCTORS OFFICE
Tar places a call
TAR
Sorry about the hour Yes its

Lydia Tar calling I must speak
with Mr Singer immediately
TARS HOME STUDY - LATER

On her machine reading an obituary for Krista Taylor from the
Mount Kisko Daily Voice that includes a picture of Krista
conducting a youth orchestra at 17 Laughing No tattoos no
wine glass just a baton and a heartbreaking smile The
accompanying text reads Krista Sides Taylor 25 died
unexpectedly on November 4 at her Murray Hill apartment
Funeral services will be private

LUNCH WITH ANDRIS — SAVOY HAVANA BAR

Tar exhausted wobbly rubs her eyes

ANDRIS
Tired
TAR
Sleep is elusive
ANDRIS
I was the same before a recording
date Lydia are you absolutely

certain about Sebastian
(she nods he frowns)

Mmm how did he take the news
TAR

Not well
ANDRIS

- who will you replace him with

TAR
Possibly Andrew Crust Hes been
assisting Otto Tausk at the VSO

ANDRIS
Not the girl

Tar ignores the question Andris drops it

TAR
Andris Did you ever have an issue
with a student or colleague Where
that person

ANDRIS TAR
Has someone been complaining Of course not
about me

ANDRIS (CONTD)
Because at this point theyve
missed their chance Im out of the
game Thank God I never had to be
pulled from the podium like Jimmy
Levine
ANDRIS (CONTD)
or hunted like Charles Dutoit I
take it youre asking for a reason

TAR
Theres just been so much of this
kind of thing in the news lately

ANDRIS
Well nowadays being accused is the
same as being guilty But I suppose
this was also the case many years
ago with Furtwangler and a bit with
Karajan too

TAR
Who was the better conductor

ANDRIS
I never played under Furtwangler
When I first arrived here the older
members had hushed opinions But at
the same time they wanted to leave
that era behind

TAR
The war

ANDRIS
Post-war The denazification If
someone pointed a finger at you
the process started all over again
Furtwangler never joined the Party
Refused to give the salute to conduct
the Horst-Wessel-Lied or to sign
his letters with Heil Hitler even
those he wrote to Hitler But he was
required to be denazified Until then
he was semi-retired -- playing corpses

TAR
Playing corpses

ANDRIS
Secretly performing in a cemetery

TAR
Surely youre not equating sexual
impropriety with being an accused Nazi

ANDRIS
Either way you have to be ready For
years I made sure all the hangers in
my closet were facing the same
direction
AWAKE IN BED

Sharon reading Tar with the hangars After awhile

TAR
How many are auditioning Monday
SHARON
No one
TAR
No one
SHARON

Well perhaps Martin who has never
gotten along with Gosia and would
be happy to sit downstage for once

TAR
He will still need to audition

SHARON
Of course We must follow the rules

CHAMBER HALL

The same adjudicators as before Sharon Knut ANOTHER
ORCHESTRA MEMBER and of course Tar The four sit waiting as
Francesca hands out score sheets and pencils

TAR
Arent we being a bit formal
Francesca From what I understand
theres just one player auditioning

FRANCESCA
No Maestro there are two

TWO AUDITIONS IN MINIATURE

The first played on the faces of those in the rake The
second PUSHING TOWARD THE STAGE like a cat stalking its prey
The movement in sync with the long dramatic phrase leading up
to the cadenza

The piece ends The unseen player behind the screen departs
Sharon Tar and Knut are bowled over and theres no hiding it

MOMENTS LATER
Results in Francesca at the ready Sharon reading the tally

SHARON
well its unanimous
(looks up from paper)
and we have a problem Shes not
officially been invited to become a
member of the orchestra
TAR
She wouldnt need be to solo for us

KNUT
I believe the criteria for the
audition was all section players

Sharon and Francesca watching closely to see if Tar will object

TAR
Then her audition gets thrown out
Francesca please ask Martin to step
back in so we can give him the news

SHARON
- ho wait

OUTSIDE CHAMBER HALL — LATER

The door opens Olga emerges with the biggest smile shes
ever had or will have on her face She sprints away

The exiting quorum met with a HAPPY SCREAM from some recess
in the building exchange knowing looks

PRINCIPAL CONDUCTORS OFFICE

Tar arrives to find Francesca working a WHITEBOARD CALENDAR
filling Olgas name into Tars master rehearsal schedule

FRANCESCA
I1l confirm these dates with her

TAR

Good have a seat Ive made a
decision regarding Sebastians
replacement and I want you to
know it wasnt an easy one This
position brings with it enormous
responsibility and my personal
affection for you aside I will
have to go with someone more
more experienced

Stay on FRANCESCAS FACE
TAR WAKES TO THE TONE AGAIN
ENTERS THE KITCHEN

Opens the door The tone stops She turns as if sensing
something else in the room

BEDROOM

She falls back into bed Knowing she wont sleep and
wondering how long this feeling will continue
CHARLOTTENBERG APARTMENT

Tar at the piano making notations Once again the two-tone
INTERVAL SOUNDS from somewhere beyond the wall She grimaces
puts her hands to her ears KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK Furious now
she stands strides to the door flings it open and

TAR
Leave me alone I dont have your--

finds Olga standing there confused by the outburst

TAR (CONTD)
Im sorry please come in

LATER

Tar at the piano accompanying Olga strikes the chords for
what would be the string pizzicatos setting up Olgas solo
She plays the theme until the first pianissimo (5th bar of 42)

TAR
Good The contrast is better now
dont you think

Olga nods She may or may not agree This not lost on Tar

TAR (CONTD)
How do you take your tea

OLGA
Black Strong
(points to piano)
Is alright I play

TAR
Of course

KITCHEN

Tar sets the KETTLE on the stove and retrieves good CHINA
The first notes waft in from the studio We recognize them as
the theme of the composition Tars been trying to write
However up to this point its been all stop-start without
hearing the thing through Tars ears perk to it she smiles
and allows herself to experience it another way Tar drifts

BACK INTO THE STUDIO

And watches Olga play the piece with the delicacy and
sophistication of Constance Keene It comes to an abrupt halt

TAR
Thats as far as Ive gotten

OLGA
(plays Tars phrase)

is good this part here
OLGA (CONTD)
but maybe this is better
(changes phrase)
Ato B flat yes thats it
oh I like that sound

She plays it again her way not Tars Indifferent to the
power differential and the boundary line she just crossed
Tar should banish her from the piano and her composition but
instead finds herself turning a corner she never saw coming

TAR SITS ALONE IN HER CAR AT OLGAS NEUKOLLN BED STAY
Watching the young woman cross the street turn and give a
big goofy wave Tar raises her hand and gives a tiny wave
back Then watches Olga disappear into the building

TAR (PRE-LAP)
Hello

TAR ARRIVES HOME
And heads into the
LIVING ROOM

To find ANGELA Sharons strict proper frightening
mother sitting alone in a high-back chair KNITTING

TAR
Hello Angela

ANGELA (SUBTITLED)
(looks up nods)
Sharon is out with her sister
From the way they were whispering
Id say that theyre up to no good
The child is in its room

PETRAS BEDROOM

Tar peeks inside No Petra Just DOZENS of DOLLS on the floor
carefully arranged in a half-moon configuration facing a
small STOOL on top of which lies a WHITE STABILO and a craft
table filled with drawings and clay moldings of the pattern

TAR
Petra

The sound of the child humming the interval
TAR HEADS

Into her office Pulls back the curtains and sees a tiny
mummy of a figure twisting in the sheers

TAR
Petra what are you doing in here
PETRA
Hiding from her
TAR
Why
PETRA
She told me to put my things in
order but they already are
TAR
Yes I see that theyre all

ready for you
PETRAS BEDROOM

The two on the floor with Petras orchestra of dolls Petra
handing out white pencils

PETRA
Im going to give everyone a
pencil

TAR
Everyone They cant all conduct
honey its not a democracy

GROSSER SAAL ELGAR CONCERTO FIGURE 72 TO END

Olga tearing it up A player possessed Tar shuts the iris
The TAP TAP TAP of bows on stands

TAR
Very nice Well go back to the
Allegro Molto after the break

Sharon watches Tar kneel down and shower Olga with attention

MANS VOICE (PRE-LAP)
How long were you acquainted with
Ms Taylor

PRINCIPAL CONDUCTORS OFFICE

Tar sits facing a MICROPHONE on a stand across from a SMART-
LOOKING MAN taking notes

TAR
Ill need to double-check with my
assistant but cumulatively speaking
I believe not more than a few months

SMART-LOOKING MAN
(turns off recorder)
Thank you for the time Maestro
This recording will exist on a
protected server under attorney
client privilege with Mr Singer
SMART-LOOKING MAN (CONTD)
He will follow up with you to help
prepare for the deposition

TAR
Deposition

SMART-LOOKING MAN
Yes I assumed you were aware Mr
Singers office said theyd been
coordinating with your assistant

TAR STRIDES PAST OFFICE ASSISTANTS - 120 BPM
Tar on her mobile leaving a VM

TAR
Francesca you had better get your
pretty little ass here right now

LINAS VOICE (PRE-LAP)
The only communication weve
received from Francesca

HUMAN RESOURCES — MOMENTS LATER

Tar facing LINA GREFF the orchestras head of HR

LINA (CONTD)

was an email to my assistant in
the middle of the night tendering
her immediate resignation Stating
she would be in contact when she had
more details to provide

TAR
what kind of details

LINA
A new address I suppose In the
meantime weve been trying all
morning to find someone suitable to
assist you on a temporary basis
For now perhaps your new assistant
conductor would be the right fit

TAR
Uh no hes not available
until after the five live date

THE TAYCAN MOVING TOO FAST

TAR
That two-faced little bitch

SHARON
Imagine her hurt Lydia That
position was thought to be hers

—64—
TAR
Dont you dare try and defend her

ANOTHER CAR merges into their lane TAR LAYS on the HORN

SHARON
I know how much you depended on her

TAR
Shell come galumphing back I have
a dumbphone like every robot How
hard can it be to text all day

SHARON

Please slow down

(she doesnt)
Slow down Or drop me off

THE TAYCAN PULLS TO THE SHOULDER

Sharons left there holding her violin case Tar quickly
acclerates and screeches away

OUTSIDE HUFEISENSIEDLUNG
Tar pounds on a door

TAR
Francesca Francesca open up

A BLOND CHILD wearing a RED JACKET in the yard next door
stares over at Tar who tries the door and it opens she

MOVES INTO A HALLWAY

Flinching at the sight of a SHADOW cast against the wall from
the bedroom the shape and sway looks as if it might be
Francescas hanging body

IN THE BEDROOM

She SNATCHES a SCARF hanging from an open window dancing in
the breeze the source of the shadow It feels monumental in
a room that looks as if it has been hastily emptied

HER FEET cross a floor strewn with red-pencilled PAGES She
reaches down and grabs a few The first has the MAZE-LIKE
DRAWING weve seen before scrawled across its length The
second has something lined out and next to it written more
lies The third a PROOF WATERMARKED TILE LEAF of Tar on Tar
marked with curves and arrows to form the anagram Rat on Rat

A HAND falls on Tars shoulder She turns and finds a FIERCE-
FACED WOMAN staring back at her

FIERCE-FACED WOMAN (GERMAN SUBTITLED)
Youre trespassing Fraulein
WHISPERS BUILD

From Francescas lips to others ears then diminuendo into
the pulse of a drum accompanied by something writhing
replaced by a Shipibo-Konibo shaman face adorned with a Kené
pattern followed by a tableau of still water under the vast
Amazon rainforest Floating on that water the small sofa bed
of Tars Charlottenberg apartment with Tar asleep on it A
spark and her chest ignites as a water-snake glides straight
towards the bed Her hand rises and falls She wakes to

SOMEONE POUNDING ON THE DOOR

Of the apartment accompanied by the sound of the interval
She quickly rises opens the door and finds Eleanor standing
there looking even more desperate than before

ELEANOR (GERMAN SUBTITLED)
Come now

She turns and flees down the hallway Tar in spite of
herself follows her to the end where Eleanor waits at

AN OPEN DOOR

Then disappears inside Tar cautiously follows her into a room
frozen in time The furnishings decor and telephone havent
changed since the 1950s The smell makes her cover her face
The SOUND of the electronic TWO-TONE INTERVAL coming from the
other room draws her forward into

A LARGER SPACE where Eleanor stands looking down at the floor
where an impossibly undernourished OLD WOMAN lies naked
wearing only a cotton-webbed GAIT BELT Her backside legs
and feet covered in FECES she stares up helplessly Eleanor
gestures to an ancient porcelain TRANSPORT COMMODE

ELEANOR
We must transfer her

Tar ill-equipped somehow finds another gear
TAR
its going to be alright
Fraulein Im here to help you
She steps forward to take the womans outstretched hand

ELEANOR
Not the hand Use the strap

Tar squats grabs one side of the belt Eleanor grabs the
other they manage to pull the woman to her feet and over to
the commode Tar unsure of her role now looks away and sees

A SMALL WHITE PLASTIC BOX adorned with Smart Caregiver
blinking RED on a table SOUNDING the two-tone warning
ELEANOR (CONTD)
Go Go now

Tar nods and makes her way
BACK TO HER OWN APARTMENT

Strips out of her night gown Washes off in the kitchen sink
Looks up to the SOUND of someone POUNDING on her door Shuts

off the water Throws on a robe and moves to open it Olga

dripping wet from the rain rushes inside

OLGA
Sorry Im late again

Olga noting the bed on the couch and Tars pajamas

OLGA (CONTD)
You live here

TAR
- not normally no

OLGA
Do you have a towel

TAR
Of course

MOMENTS LATER

Tar now dressed hands the young woman the towel who dries
her hair as Tar makes up the sofa bed Their eyes meet and
they share a laugh at this awkward almost domestic moment

DRIVING THROUGH NEUKOLLN — LATER
Same route Its drizzling again The vent still rattling

OLGA
There is small concert with
musician friends You should come

TAR
Thank you but I must get home

OLGA
You have child yes
(Tar nods)
I will not do that

TAR
Pets are better for some people

Olga pulls a Teddy Bear from her bag and waggles it at Tar
TAR PULLS TO OLGAS NEUKOLLN BED STAY

Olga gives her a friendly peck and gets out Tar watches her
cross the street turn and give a big goofy wave This time
Tar waves back Shes about to pull out when she sees the bear
sitting on the passenger seat She rolls down the window to
call after Olga but she disappears into the building recess
TAR HOLDING THE BEAR

Crosses the street and enters the building met by SOUNDS that
could be Olga SINGING Tars composition the notes echoing as
casual as bird song Tar follows the sound into an open
courtyard littered with stained mattresses a rusted
wheelbarrow and other detritus The windows of every unit
boarded up covered with tags The Doppler effect here making
it impossible to accurately peg the direction of Olgas voice
SHE DESCENDS A STAIRCASE

And reaching the bottom finds herself in

A LONG CORRIDOR

Its floor pooling with water from overhead

SHE MOVES FORWARD AND PEERS INTO

Abandoned squatter-like rooms The singing disappears All
she hears now is the dripping fluid

SHE CONTINUES MOVING
Toward the other end of the corridor

TAR
Olga

The SOUND of an animal SKITTERING behind her turns her
around But the corridor is empty

SHE CONTINUES ON

Hears the SOUND again and turns Nothing

SHE JUST WANTS TO GET OUT

The opposite direction from where the SOUND is coming from

She hears it again turns and a BLACK GERMAN SHEPHERD stares
at her from the other end She backs away slowly then runs

REACHES AN OUTSIDE STAIRWAY

Bounding stairs two at a time Her TOE CATCHES She FACE-
PLANTS CRACK The SOUND like the breaking of cartilage
SHE RETURNS HOME

Through the kitchen opens the freezer retrieves an ICE
TRAY empties it onto a DISH TOWEL and POUNDS it with a
ROLLING PIN The foreground dirties

Tar turns Sharon shrieks And for the first time we see the

damage Tars right cheek completely swollen over a very
bloody eye LaMotta after the Valentines Day Massacre

KITCHEN STEPS - MOMENTS LATER
Sharon sits across from Tar trying to dress her wounds

SHARON
Why didnt you call the police

TAR
I fought He ran Whats to tell

SHARON
I1l get you something for the pain

Sharon leaves Petra crawls in and stares at Tars face

PETRA (SUBTITLED)
Was someone mean to you

TARS
Ja

Petra crawls onto Tars lap reaches up and gently touches
the undamaged part of her face

PETRA (SUBTITLED)
Youre the most beautiful person
I know

THE RAIN COMES

Over the residence asleep The Hamburg Steinway offers the
appearance of a casket containing someone lying in state

PETRA (0C)
Lydia Lydia

TAR and SHARONS BEDROOM

Tar wakes Sits up as she leaves we glimpse Krista in a
chair across the room staring back at her

PETRA (0C)

Tar heads into
PETRAS BEDROOM
Closes the door crawls in with Petra and tries to calm her

PETRA

PETRA
- yes

Petra looks past Tar to the doorway as if someones there
Tar follows the childs frightened gaze and they embrace

TRAUERMARSCH 1ST MOVEMENT BAR 406 2ND MOVEMENT BAR 1-4

She mounts the podium with her face cut and swollen and bruised
Players look away not wanting to make her uncomfortable

TAR
Alright Give me some eyes please
they look back up)

Lets shoo the elephant from the
room What the hell happened to her
face Did she schedule a nose and eye
job then decide to bail before the
surgeon finished the other half

Her joke breaks the tension and they laugh

TAR (CONTD)

Sounds of concern from 100 people Tars eyes meet Olgas
TAR (CONTD)

TAR

SHARON

how much pain youre in

TAR
Lets just finish up here

Sharon knows not to push it She looks up to see Olga waiting
at the top of the stairs

SHARON
Overall the balance feels right
Other than a quick brush-up we
should concentrate on the Elgar

TAR
Youre certain of that

SHARON
I think so yes

MOMENTS LATER
Tar sitting with Olga now flips pages on her score

TAR
Ill try to hold them back here
Theyre getting caught up in the
power of your glissando and are
trying to match it

OLGA
Where were you attacked Maestro

TAR
It doesnt matter

Reaches into her bag retrieves bear hands it to Olga

OLGA
Ah thank you There you are

DOCTORS OFFICE — NEXT DAY
Tar examined by her PHYSICIAN flinches

PHYSICIAN

TAR
I dont know ten days ago You

shoulder burns like hell Like I
fell asleep by the pool

PHYSICIAN
Okay you can put your shirt back
on Youve damaged some nerves
PHYSICIAN

feeling is called Notalgia
paresthetica

TAR
Nostalgia

PHYSICIAN
Notalgia no s

TAR
How do you treat it

PHYSICIAN
You dont Eventually it goes away
An adjustment might help Youre
somewhat crooked

The unresolved theme of Tars composition leads us to the
CHARLOTTENBERG APARTMENT

The last chord decays She nods satisfied Grabs a PENCIL
and on the front page signs For Petra Stands sits again
crosses it out and writes something else

Her phone pings she checks a text from Britta containing a
link Clicks on it

TARS VOICE (0C)
A negro product exploited by the Jews

A YOUTUBE VIDEO OF

Tars Juilliard Master Class posted on twitter tagged with
lydiatar aggressively edited in the most damning way At
least two angles here implying that there was more than one
person involved with its creation

TAR ON VIDEO
Now lets turn our gaze back to the
piano bench up there and see if we
can square how any of those things
possibly relate to the person
seated before us

Reaction shot of Max and uncomfortable laughs from students
TAR ON VIDEO (CONTD)

A super hot young woman Now you
can masturbate

We see a grainy blown-up iPhone video of her hand reaching
across Maxs lap at the piano bench and stopping his knee

TARS VOICE (0C)
But what are you actually doing for me
Her mobile buzzes Britta and she answers it

TAR
Hello Britta yes I just saw
it this afternoon

SHE LOCKS UP THE APARTMENT

Heads downstairs and sees a covered GURNEY being carried from
Eleanors apartment by two UNDERTAKERS She pushes herself
into the corner to let them pass before following A
frightened Eleanor appears on the landing above for the
tiniest moment their eyes meet

ORCHESTRAS BOARD ROOM

She sits with Britta and board members comprised of players
including Knut For once shes outnumbered

TAR
First of all that class was conducted
in a tech-free zone

Shes interrupted by the UNSCREWING of a TALL WATER BOTTLE
followed by the FIZZY FAST POUR into a GLASS the hard
LANDING of the bottle then Knut draining the glass

TAR (CONTD)
Second whoever violated that rule
edited what weve all seen to create
linguistic traps to completely redefine
my words Look at the reverse shots on
the students Theres no way those were
done in real time Its a hatchet job

BRITTA
Im sure thats true Lydia And were
it just this video wed not be sitting
here Unfortunately its linked to an
article in the New York Post regarding
Krista Taylors suicide

Tar blindsided takes a moment to process this

BRITTA (CONTD)
which alludes to other
Accordion Fellows they claim to
have interviewed Laura Can you
tell us about your conversations

LAURA KIM the orchestras publicist stands

LAURA KIM
We havent had any Obviously we
gave no response as we first
wanted to meet to discuss strategy
Heres a summary of the article
TAR
Thank you Laura
looks it over)

enticed and groomed
multiple young women to engage in
sex acts for professional favors
Blocked opportunities to those who
didnt comply This is total
fiction

(tosses it forces a laugh)
The Post is a how-de-do scandal
rag No serious person reads it

(room stares back at her)
And so far as Krista Taylor goes
she was disturbed fixated on me

MALE BOARD MEMBER
In what way

TAR
She sent weird gifts trolled me on-
line tried to send me signals

MALE BOARD MEMBER
What kind of signals

TAR
Vandalizing my wikipedia page to
say that she was my muse
(to Laura)
Thats easily checked right

Laura nods

MALE BOARD MEMBER
Did you ever report this or file a
complaint

TAR
No I probably should have but I
felt sorry for her

BRITTA
Is this something youve shared
with Sharon

TAR
I didnt want to burden her with it
BRITTA TAR
Dont you think-- Yes yes

MALE BOARD MEMBER
(to Laura)
What do you advise
LAURA KIM
Well for now it hasnt gotten all
that much traction None of the
trades have linked to it or called
for comment Lets see what happens

MALE BOARD MEMBER
We wanted to give you as much
warning as possible Lydia Before
this Fridays donor meeting

TAR

MALE BOARD MEMBER

TAR

TAR IN THE BACK OF A BLACK SUV
Moving through mid-town Manhattan

VOICE (PRE-LAP)
To all of my questions pertaining to
your communications with Krista Taylor
and others your answers have been I
dont know or I dont remember

TAR AT A CONFERENCE TABLE

Seated behind a MIKE next to MARTY SINGER Both facing
COUNSEL FOR THE TAYLOR FAMILY and the COURT REPORTER

TAYLOR FAMILY COUNSEL
Is there anything I could show you
that might refresh your recollection
Any document such as emails from you
or your personal assistant Ms
Lentini that might help you recall
what you did and didnt say

ELIOT KAPLANS OFFICE

Tar steps in Eliot gets to his feet No greeting No
handshake This is all business and they both know it

ELIOT

Guess you know by now that Bryant
Park bumped you to 53rd Street

(hands her sheet of paper)
The Kaplan Funds prepared
statement Im sorry to say that
this will likely be the last time
we see each other

TAR
Well now I can book my own plane
tickets and you can bother someone
else to try and teach you how to
crawl to the podium

THE SUV TRAVELING SOUTH ON FIFTH

Tar and Olga in back They turn onto 53rd and pull in front of
the library Tar noting the outdoor advertising Eliot
promised along with DOZENS OF YOUNG MEN and WOMEN beating
drums sounding horns and holding signs emblazoned with
JUSTICE FOR KRISTA and LISTEN TO THE SURVIVORS
Tar unnerved looks to a seemingly oblivious Olga glued to
her smartphone and leans forward to the driver

TAR
Is there a back entrance

TAR BEHIND A MIKE
Reading from her book in the small area off rare books room

TAR
The link between music and language is
what makes music unique to human beings- -

Her eyes find Olga in the back flirting with a young man

TAR (CONTD)

Indeed the common metaphors used
to explain music are based on the
idea that music is a language
albeit a secret one and in this
way holy and unknowable These
joyful noises we make being the
closest thing any of us might ever
experience to the divine

Snide TEXTS fly OVER her IMAGE trotted out metaphor saw and
divinity bit--fuck me if she uses the word allegory

TAR (ON SMARTPHONE SCREEN) (CONTD)
- yet something born by the mere
act of moving air

CARLYLE HOTEL ELEVATOR
Tar and Olga ascend with the uniformed operator who smiles
THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN
Olga and Tar step off
TAR
Meet downstairs for dinner in say

thirty minutes

OLGA
Thank you but I am jet lag

TAR
(hides disappointment )
Of course Ill probably do the same
SOMETIME LATER

On her machine searching her name on twitter and hearting a
post accompanied by a picture of her wonderful talk by the
great Lydia Tar She scrolls to the next Tar and her fresh
meat above a phone clip of she and Olga rushing together
into the library entrance with one of the protestors yelling
If youre her new girlfriend you better watch out honey
Her mobile rings Sharon she silences it A moment later
the room phone rings She ignores it Finally it stops

She closes her machine Moves to her bag hunts a beta-
blocker moves to the minibar looking for water nothing

TAR
(picks up house phone)
How long would it take to get a
bottle of water no thats
alright Ill just run down

She crosses the room opens the door and steps out in time
to see Olga disappear back into the elevator for a night out

OLGA (0C)
Lobby please

BATTERY TUNNEL — TOWNCAR ON THE MOVE — EARLY MORNING
Tar watches a completely absent Olga texting
TAR ARRIVES HOME

And begins turning off the lights Moves to kill the last
senses someone there and turns Its Sharon

TAR
Jesus

Sharon silent The moment freighted Tar moves to attack

TAR (CONTD)
It was Britta right That is how
you heard about these millennial
robots trading in lies

SHARON
(calm)
I could care less about the
Juilliard thing

TAR
She has too much time on her hands
Shes fringe the worst kind
(on the move)
Every time I walk out of this house
shes in your ear with intrigue
TARS HOME STUDY

She pulls performance scores from her shelves dropping them
on the floor in a panic

TAR (CONTD)
Or asking me about some other
piece of fringe like Samantha
Hankey A nobody who has nothing
better to do than drop my name at
lunch and imply things

SHARON
(arrives in doorway)
I feel sorry for you

TAR
Save it

SHARON
I tried calling you last night Did
you have fun with her

TAR
my back is killin
(brushes past her
Francesca left And I simply needed
someone to carry my bags Who was I
supposed to ask to go with me Knut

SHARON
(calmly follows)
There are many things I accept
about you and in the end Im sure
I could get over something like
this But thats not were talking
about is it

Tar busies herself in their private rooms as if the
conversation is over Sharon watches her from the library

SHARON (CONTD)
These accusations from the parents
of the girl who suicided

This stops Tar cold who for the first time realizes the
extent of what Sharon knows

TAR
you honestly believe what
theyre saying theyre lies

She moves back into the other room teeters sits and drops
her head into her hands trying to decide her next move
SHARON
Do you understand what it was like
to walk into my sectional yesterday
and see people whispering about me
Its got nothing to do with what
theyre accusing you of — its a
simple matter of not warning me that
our family is in danger

TAR
(with contempt)
What good would that have done
What could you possibly do to make
things better

Sharon kneels down to Tars level face-to-face now

SHARON

(with equal contempt)
Because I deserve that Those are
the rules You are to ask for my
fucking council the way you always
have The way you did when you first
arrived here as a guest conductor
looking for a permanent position
You asked what were the politics
what were the moves --- How could we
swing it Of course those discussions
took place in another bed Or rather
on the couch of that horrible place
you still cant let go of

TAR
Ah the old sorrow blows in
how cruel of you to define our
relationship as transactional

SHARON

Theres only one relationship
youve ever had that wasnt and
shes sleeping in the room next
door

(stands and moves off)
Apparently this hasnt even
crossed your mind

ORCHESTRA PARKING GARAGE

people in noisy conversation suddenly go silent and stare
back at her with stone cold faces She knows that this is it
GROSSER SAAL SECTION K

Quasimodo staring down at the stage Tar removed from the
players running a sectional below their mocking shared laugh
might very well be at her expense

CHARLOTTENBERG APARTMENT STAIRCASE

Huffing and puffing Tar struggles to drag her LUGGAGE up the
five flights of stairs

REPEATS HER DOOR RITUAL

Candles and breath Blows out the match and falls into an in-
between place where the specter of Krista Taylor envelops her
in a fashion that appears to cause her fear and great pain

SHE WAKES ON THE SOFA BED
BOXES ALONE WITH A HEAVY BAG
SPRINTS BENEATH THE S-BAHN TRESTLE

Sees something and begins to slow Wild post after wild post
of she and Mahler more than tagged vandalized Her face
painted over with large red xs and other forms She catches
her breath and rips one of the posters from the wall

TAR PARKED OUTSIDE PETRAS SCHOOL

Watching parents at pick-up quickly heads over to Petra
We stay in the car watching as Sharon approaches Tar Body
language clear Tar is not welcome Sharon leads Petra away

CHARLOTTENBERG APARTMENT

Tar flattened by the turn of events sits on her daybed

spit valve The applause finally dies down he lifts his
horn and readies for the downbeat of the funeral march

Tar straightens steps to the podium and LIFTS her BATON

TAR
Alright Give me some eyes From

The players embarrassed look away Sharon goes white

ELIOT (0C)

The mere sound of this voice makes Tar even more furious

ELIOT (CONTD)

TAR
This is my score

STAFF SECURITY rush out from stage L and R and pull her away
but she still manages to get one last kick in

Shes spent now Doesnt fight her keepers Like someone

Unimaginable today eager boys and girls in neat sport coats

glued to the man in front of them conducting the NY Phil The
microphone attached to his lapel picks up his passionate
grunts and groans as he sways and moves like a dancer a
boxer Lear screaming at the sky He brings the music to a
rousing crescendo then quickly grabs his handkerchief mops
his face and turns to the young audience who applaud The
mans charm is like that of an ideal dinner guest brilliant
frighteningly articulate warm funny and wise
LEONARD BERNSTEIN
Didnt you feel triumphant Now we
can really understand what the
meaning of music really is Its
the way it makes you feel when you
hear it Finally weve taken that
last giant step and were there we
know what music means and we
dont have to know a lot of stuff
about sharps and flats and chords
and all that business in order to
understand music If it tells us
something And the most wonderful
thing of all is that theres no
limit to the different kind of
feelings music can make you have
And some of those feelings are so
special and so deep that they
cant even be described in words
You see we cant always name the
things we feel Sometimes we can
We can say we feel joy pleasure
peacefulness whatever love hate
But every once in a while we have
feelings that are so deep and so
special that we have no words for
them

CLOSE ON TAR remembering the effect this first had on her

LEONARD BERNSTEIN
And thats where music is so
marvelous Because music names them
for us Only in notes instead of
words Its all in the way music
moves You must never forget that
music is movement Always going
somewhere Shifting and changing
and flowing From one note to
another And that can tell us more
about the way we feel than a million
words can Now here were going to
play you a--

Tar starts to a DOOR slam She stops the tape and moves to
