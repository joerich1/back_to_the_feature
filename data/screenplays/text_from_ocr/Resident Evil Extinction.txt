Theres nothing harder to kill

Than something thats already dead

INT MANSION - BATHROOM

CLOSE ON BLUE EYES as they snap open Woken from a bad dream
WIDEN to reveal a womans face to go with the eyes Its not
perfection but its close Well call her ALICE

Its raining

No not rain for as we WIDEN more Alice is revealed to be
lying in the SHOWER

Shes naked
And I take it back
She is perfection

As she gets up Alice looks around Tiled floor bathroom
fittings made of brass

Alice moves through the room like someone who doesnt know where
she is She stops in front of a mirror Wipes the condensation
from it Stares at her own naked body as if it belonged to a
stranger

She sees a fresh bruise on one shoulder From falling in the
shower But her other shoulder is even more intriguing An old
scar traces a long jagged line from the top of her arm to her
elbow Looks like a knife did it A big one

Alice touches the scar Like it was all strange to her Like
shes never seen it before

INT MANSION - BEDROOM
Alice sees a red dress laid on the bed for her A pair of boots
stand close by Did she lay these out She just doesnt
remember

CUT TO
INT MANSION - BEDROOM - LATER

Alice now dressed stands over an antique writing desk Lying
on it is a handwritten note She picks it up

“Today All Your Dreams Come True
Alice walks to the window

SO FAR EVERYTHING IS AN EXACT REPLAY OF RESIDENT EVIL 1 UNTIL --

Alice parts the curtains but instead of a view of the woods
there is nothing but CONCRETE outside the window A solid
impenetrable CONCRETE WALL

Off Alices puzzled look we --

CUT TO
INT MANSION — HALLWAY
Alice wanders the mansion

CLOSE ON a framed photograph as Alice takes it from a side
table Its of her and a handsome man He has his arm around
her He wears a wedding ring

Alice looks at her own hand She too wears a simple gold band
Is this man her husband She stares at the picture again
Trying to remember

INT MANSION - ENTRANCE CHAMBER
Alice approaches the front door of the mansion
EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY AS IT WAS IN THE FIRST FILM UNTIL --

Alice opens the door But instead of an ornamental garden she
steps out into --

INT THE HIVE - GLASS CORRIDOR

A long corridor made entirely of glass The walls the floor
the ceiling This is where ONE (the leader of the Commando
team) and the other Commandoes met their bloody end in RESIDENT
EVIL 1 But Alice doesnt know this She doesnt remember
anything But she knows that something is wrong

The lights dim Something is happening Alice turns to return
to the Mansion but the door has already swung closed There is
no going back

Suddenly a horizontal beam of laser light travels down the
corridor at high speed It starts at ankle level and then rises
to chest height There is no escaping it And its headed
straight for Alice

At the last moment Alice leaps into the air - and stays there
She is hanging from an air vent in the ceiling her legs pulled
up above the level of the laser The beam has passed right
beneath her only just missing

THIS IS AN EXACT REPEAT FROM RESIDENT EVIL 1 except instead of
Ones knife being caught by the laser beam a thin sliver of
Alices red dress drifts to the floor sliced off by the deadly
laser

Alice drops back to the floor as the lights begin to dim again
And because history is repeating itself we know what will
happen next Alice will die just as One did

A second laser beam fires towards Alice She jumps in the air
again The thin laser wire switches to a grid Fifty
interlocking laser lines forming a deadly net from which there
is no escape

But Alice swings her body upwards kicking the air vent aside
and disappears into the air duct above the corridor At the
last moment she pulls her head into the air duct and escapes the
laser grid

It was a close call as witnessed by the strands of blonde hair
that drift slowly to the floor of the glass corridor The ends
are singed burnt by the laser beam

INT AIR DUCT

Tight claustrophobic and pitch black in here Barely room to
move But Alice crawls forward Pushing ever onwards
Eventually she sees a faint light filtering in from above An
access hatch of some kind in the roof of the duct

Alice pushes it cautiously open to reveal --
INT RACCOON CITY HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR NIGHT

Alice climbs from the access hatch and stares at the deserted
corridor --

It is the same one she wandered at the end of RESIDENT EVIL 1
The very same one the NEMESIS prowled in RESIDENT EVIL
APOCALYPSE

Alice looks around trying to remember trying to figure this
out At the end of the corridor are a set of glass doors
leading to the city streets Its silent out there

Alice takes a few steps forward and then halts Sensing
something The corridor is empty but still Alice feels uneasy
A GURNEY rests against the wall beside her Alice takes it and
pushes it down the corridor ahead of her

The gurney triggers a CONCEALED TRAP A viciously sharp WIRE
slices across the corridor cutting the metal gurney clean in
half It would have done the same to Alice

Alice steps carefully around the trap and accidentally triggers
a second device

A JUMPING JACK MINE which EXPLODES at chest height
Alice looks down to see blood spreading across her red dress
After a moment of surprise she falls backwards DEAD

As Alices blood pools around her UMBRELLA SCIENTISTS appear
from concealed doorways along the length of the corridor They
had been watching all along The Scientists wear Haz-Mat suits
with mirrored visors

CLOSE ON -- one mirrored visor We see dead Alice reflected in
it Then the Scientist pulls off the visor to reveal -- DOCTOR
ISAACS the creator of Programme Alice from RESIDENT EVIL
APOCALYPSE He stares down at the body in disgust

DOCTOR ISAACS
Take a sample of her blood
(gestures to the dead body)
Then get rid of that

CUT TO
EXT DEATH VALLEY DAY

A merciless sun beats down on an ancient wooden building that
seems to have grown out of the salt flats Its a WEATHER
STATION

INT WEATHER STATION DAY

The interior is simple Cheap Formica table a few wooden
chairs Barometric equipment that looks like it dates back to
the 1950s There is no one here Nothing breaks the silence
until --

We sense a slight vibration Mercury in the THERMOMETER
trembles a little

The vibration steadily builds to a powerful tremor as suddenly
the floor SPLITS IN HALF The table and chairs slide smoothly
to one side to reveal a gaping concrete shaft that drops away
into the depths of the earth Moments later a HYDRAULIC
PLATFORM rises from the shaft and locks into place

Riding on it are two Umbrella Scientists in their familiar Haz-
Mat suits Between them they carry the dead body of Alice

EXT WEATHER STATION DAY

The two scientists carry the body to the edge of a long trench
dug in the salt flats They swing it twice and then heave it
in

CLOSE ON -- the body of Alice as it rolls into the trench and
comes to a rest Her dead eyes staring up at the brutal desert
sun Slowly the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the trench is
lined with LIME and is filled with over a hundred other bodies
Each one of the bodies wears the identical same red dress And
each has the same face

OVER A HUNDRED DEAD ALICES ROTTING IN THE DESERT HEAT

As the two Scientists return to the Weather Station the CAMERA
CRANES UP to reveal a perimeter fence that surrounds the
building It is fifteen feet high and topped with razor wire
It looks impregnable and it needs to be

For pushing against it are THOUSANDS OF UNDEAD

ROLL CREDITS --

NT FVIL

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - NEVADA DAY

The abandoned highway is littered with burnt out cars and
trucks Each one is weathered and aged Whatever happened here
it happened a while ago We missed the apocalypse

A strong heat haze is being kicked off the asphalt Through it
a LONE RIDER slowly emerges They are astride a HONDA FIREBLADE
- the biggest most powerful road bike in production Back when
the World still made such things

The Rider passes by and we see that the Fireblade is weighed
down with saddlebags and gasoline cans

EXT KNAC TV STATION DAY
A local TV station at the edge of a small town The lush grass

and flowerbed that used to spell out the station name are long
since dead The sprinkler system choked with sand

The Rider pulls up in the abandoned parking lot The Rider
wears a long battered duster worth of SERGIO LEONE She
doesnt wear a helmet just a bandana across her nose and mouth
She lowers it to reveal -- ALICE Her face caked in sand and
dirt from a hard ride but shimmering blue eyes as vivid as
ever And this is the REAL Alice She remembers everything

Even the things she would rather forget

FREEZE FRAME on Alices face The Screen turns to a COMPUTER
READ OUT bearing the logo of the UMBRELLA CORPORATION

PRESENT LOCATION UNKNOWN

STATUS PRESUMED DECEASED

As the information is typed up on screen it is also narrated by
the WHITE QUEEN A holographic image of a seven year old girl
the White Queen is the physical manifestation of a powerful
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

The White Queen is the sister computer to the homicidal RED
QUEEN encountered in RESIDENT EVIL 1

END FREEZE FRAME --

Alice steps from the bike and hits PLAY on battered digital
memory stick A small earpiece barely noticeable rests in
Alices left ear We hear the whisper of the recording play
It is a radio transmission Distorted and desperate --

RECORDING
This is KNAC transmitting on
the emergency frequency Can anyone
hear us We have seven people here
In need of urgent medical attention

We notice that a powerful RADIO RECEIVER is strapped to the side
of the Fireblade This is clearly a signal that Alice has
picked up earlier

As she listens Alice places a funnel in the gas tank of the
bike She upends a gasoline can and balances it on the funnel
It starts to fill the empty tank We notice an Umbrella Logo on
the gasoline can Even after the End of the World the Umbrella
Corporation is still all pervasive

RECORDING (CONTD)
(increasingly desperate)
Were holed up in the TV station at
the edge of town Off Highway 10
junction 27 Were surrounded We
need help Can anyone hear us
Can anyone help us Please

Alice hits STOP Then stares up at the TV Station Its
boarded up and riddled with bullet holes and burn marks Signs
of a desperate fight but no signs of life

Alice takes a step forward but is stopped by a sudden GROWLING
sound from behind her

Alice shows no emotion

Then once again the low threatening growling sound Alice
turns Its coming from the Fireblade One of the large
saddlebags shakes for a moment and then is still Alice
approaches the bag and unhooks the lid

Immediately something flies from the bag landing beside Alice
Its an ugly ball of fur named PACO

Paco is a real mongrel Hard to tell what the mix is
Certainly no self respecting breed would want to take credit
But hes fierce and loyal The dog stares up at Alice and
growls again Pissed that she almost left him behind

Alice walks towards the TV Station and Paco follows at her heel
INT KNAC TV STATION DAY

There is little natural light in here - the windows are all
boarded up in defence against the Undead But the TV station
clearly has its own generator as there are electric lights
working inside Many of them are smashed however and the
generator is slowly dying causing the lights to pulse and dim
As a result the interior is alive with shadows that creep and
grow

A stairwell leads down into a darkened basement Alice looks at
the stairs and nods to Paco The dog stares at the inky
darkness below holding untold dangers He looks back up at
Alice and growls under his breath - How come I get the
basement

But a moment later he obediently trots down the stairs

Alice draws her weapon of choice (under-over 12 Gauge sawn-off
belt fed inlaid with mother-of-pearl) and heads deeper into the
TV Station

INT TV STATION - BASEMENT DAY

Paco hits the bottom of the stairs and sniffs the air Its a
labyrinth down here further complicated by an endless tangle of
wires and cables Paco cautiously heads off into the darkness

INT TV STATION - STUDIO DAY

Alice crosses the abandoned news studio The place is a mess
Posters promoting Howard Stern and the Teletubbies hang on the
wall smeared with blood

This isnt a smart place to be Its claustrophobic its dark
and there could be anything hiding here

Overlooking the studio is the CONTROL BOOTH where the director
would sit There are no lights on in the booth but Alice
senses a figure up there watching through the glass She eases
the hammer back on the 12 Gauge and takes the stairs leading up
to the booth

INT TV STATION - BASEMENT DAY

Paco stops at an intersection A tattered poster hangs peeling
from the wall It advertises K-9 The Movie JIM BELUSHI
stares at his dog as the tag line proclaims - Ones just a
little smarter than the other

If it means anything to Paco he doesnt let it show He just
moves on into the darkness

INT TV STATION - CONTROL BOOTH DAY

Alice approaches the FIGURE in the booth It is sitting in a
high backed chair hunched over the control panel The Figure
doesnt move but seems to be muttering to itself Alice
approaches cautiously her hand reaching for the back of the
swivel chair

INT TV STATION - BASEMENT DAY

Paco stops hearing a sound Up ahead something moves
Something big

INT TV STATION - CONTROL BOOTH DAY

Alice gun at the ready turns the swivel chair to reveal --

A BODY long since dead A shotgun still gripped between his
hands The barrel rests in what remains of his mouth On the
control panel behind him the TV screens play an endless loop of
old news footage This is what Alice had heard

The nametag on the body identifies him as - BOB SMYTHEE
DIRECTOR

Alice stares at Bob Emotionless

A RED NOTEBOOK lies to one side of the body A JOURNAL of some
kind Alice picks it up Then she reaches in the pockets of
the dead man Pulls out a few spare shotgun cartridges and
pockets them

INT TV STATION - BASEMENT DAY

Paco is motionless Staring at the CREATURE up ahead

What little light there is glints off its bloody flayed hide
Its lips draw back to reveal crooked chipped but wickedly sharp
teeth Teeth that are stained with blood

The creature steps forward into the half light to reveal --

AN UNDEAD DOG

This hellhound is at least four times the size of poor Paco
Paco takes a step back but is stopped by another growl from
behind him The unfortunate little hound turns to see a SECOND
Undead Dog even bigger than the first

Paco wheels around weighing his options but they all look like
shit because from the shadows steps a THIRD even more
terrifying Undead Dog This one could eat Paco with just one
bite

Paco growls defiantly

And then tail between his legs RUNS as fast as he can

INT TV STATION - BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Paco races around a corner with the three Undead Dogs in close
pursuit He takes another corner then another but his
pursuers are gaining with every turn

He races under a fallen set of shelves through a hole far too

small for the others to follow But the Undead Dogs simply
burst through the wooden shelves like they were made of paper

Paco is just moments from being caught as he rounds another
corner and JUMPS

His three pursuers follow a split-second later to see Paco
nestled in the crook of Alices arm She has her shotgun drawn

ALICE
Leave my dog the fuck alone

CLOSE ON THE SHOTGUN BARREL as Alice opens fire

IN MACRO CLOSE UP and SLOW MOTION we see the deadly spray of
lead shot tear into Undead flesh as Alice fires again and again

Alice moves with a purpose She runs to the Fireblade pulls a
desert camouflage tarp from a saddlebag and throws it over the
bike

Alice pulls off her jacket and as she runs back to the radio
station she dusts the ground behind her obliterating her
footsteps in the sand

Alice hides in the doorway BUT PACO IS STILL IN THE OPEN
Alice whistles and Paco scurries under cover beside her Just
in time --

ARIEL SHOT --

Of the radio station as THE CAMERA rockets back into the air

In an instant we are high above the desert flats racing through
the cloudless sky ending in the UPPER ATMOSPHERE as a SATELLITE
glides silently past The Satellite bears the logo of the
UMBRELLA CORPORATION

SATELLITE POV --

We see the desert flats rendered in a series of high def
digital photographs They show the KNAC Station in clear
detail But there is no sign of life Alice and Paco are
hidden from view The motorbike camouflaged beneath the tarp

The satellite passes overhead and starts to study the empty town
that lies beyond the radio station

INT KNAC TV STATION DAY

Alices watch BEEPS again This is the all clear” She steps
back out into the open without a look to the sky

EXT KNAC TV STATION - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Alice climbs back on her bike and Paco leaps into his saddlebag
beside her As she pulls out of the parking lot and back onto
the Highway the CAMERA TRACKS BACK into the depths of the TV
Station --

INT TV STATION - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

Bob the Director sits dead at the controls Around him the TV
monitors play an endless loop of old news footage

We track into the monitors until they FILL THE SCREEN --
FLASHBACK

The flashback is seen in grainy video footage News reportage
that becomes increasingly rough as the flashback continues and
society breaks down -- the last gasps of a dying World

ALICE (V0)
Raccoon City was just the beginning

ON SCREEN we witness the destruction of Raccoon City as reported
through a variety of media outlets

ALICE (CONTD)
The Umbrella Corporation thought that
they had contained the infection
but they were wrong

We see the shattered remains of Raccoon City as the blast of the
nuclear device subsides

ALICE (CONTD)
The virus spread beyond the boundaries
of Raccoon City Some thought it was
airborne

On the outskirts of the devastated city scorched leaves and
burning embers rain down in a FOREST of blackened trees

ALICE (CONTD)
Others thought it was carried by rats

THE CAMERA sinks beneath the ground in the forest and emerges
into a SEWER SYSTEM Hundreds of rats splash through the
detritus fleeing the heat of the explosion

ALICE (CONTD)
No one really knew

TIMES SQUARE in NEW YORK is seen in chaos An Undead turning to
face us and then lunging at the unseen cameraman

ALICE (CONTD)
Within weeks it had consumed the
United States The nation was in
chaos All that could be done was to
flee

In a MONTAGE of news footage we see CANADIAN BORDER GUARDS
trying to hold back a flood of American refugees

ALICE (CONTD)
Surrounding Countries tried to close
their borders To keep it contained

Undead Americans are shot as they wade across the RIO GRANDE
In still more news reports CUBAN GUNBOATS can be seen blowing
makeshift rafts out of the water Rafts filled with fleeing US
citizens

ALICE (CONTD)
«--- It didnt work

In rough video footage we witness the Undead in PARIS BERLIN
and TOKYO The CHAMPS ELYSEE The BRANDENBURGH GATE and
HARAJUKU all overrun

ALICE (CONTD)

By then everyone knew who was to
blame

DOCTOR ISAACS and other UMBRELLA OFFICIALS are seen on trial at
THE HAGUE

ALICE (CONTD)
And attempts were made to bring them
to justice but it was all too
little too late

We see Doctor Isaacs slip away as Undead attack within the
courtroom and chaos ensues

ALICE (CONTD)
And then it was done The end of the
World Just like that

Suddenly STATIC fills the frame

Theres no one left to take any more footage And nowhere left
to broadcast it

ALICE (CONTD)
What survivors there were headed for
the countryside The areas with least
population Where it was less likely
that they would catch the scent

Slowly the static is replaced by the OPEN ROAD - white lines
scything through frame

ALICE (CONTD)

We avoided major metropolitan areas
and kept on the move If we stopped
any one place too long they would
be drawn to us Only a few at first
but then more and more A limitless
supply of the dead

beat)
Staying on the road seemed the only
way to stay alive

SMASH CUT TO
EXT DESERT HIGHWAY DAY
As an ARMORED CONVOY races by at high speed A lone Undead
lunges at the lead vehicle but is SMASHED to one side This

convoy is hauling ass and in no mood to slow down

There are seven vehicles in all None of them military but all
armored and lethally customized in some way --

14

- AN AMBULANCE - which acts as the convoys mobile hospital
Wickedly sharp blades mounted to the wheels and fenders ensure
that this vehicle causes as much damage as it cures

A FIRE TRUCK that lives up to its name - mounted on top are a
twin set of flame throwers

- A SCHOOL BUS with armor plating and gun ports down the side
This acts as mobile living accommodation It is also home to a
dozen adults and a bus driver named OTTO A thirty year old
stoner Ottos job description wasnt altered a jot by the
Apocalypse

Now as then he drives the bus and stays high

- AN 18 WHEELER ARCO OIL TANKER which carries the precious
gasoline that keeps the convoy moving Protected by razor wire
and lethally sharp spikes down its length At the front and
rear of the tanker there are also makeshift gun turrets with
twin mounted 50mm caliber guns

- A DENVER KT7 NEWS TRUCK which serves as the convoys
communications centre

- A FLAT BED which carries supplies and spare parts strapped to
the back

- The lead vehicle of the convoy is a HUMMER but in Beverly
Hills Yellow with an advert for Brentwood Nails And Pedicure”
down the side of it The paintwork has faded however and it is
splashed with the dark black blood of a hundred crushed Undead

The convoy is a mobile home and refuge to just over 40 men
women and children

INT HUMMER DAY

She glances at the fresh Undead blood that has been sprayed
across the windshield

VALENTINE (CONTD)
And can you clean the windshield

Valentine makes her way along the roof of the Hummer until she
is above the gas tank Bear in mind this is all happening at
60 mph with a 14 year old at the wheel

Valentine leans down and removes the cap on the Hummers gas
tank

EXT WEATHER STATION DAY

Beside the Weather Station a sand colored camouflage net hides

two large cargo HELICOPTERS Both bear the distinctive black

paintwork and logos of the Umbrella Corporation In the

distance an ever growing army of the Undead press against the

perimeter fence

The Camera sinks beneath the ground the reveal --

INT UNDERGROUND - CONCRETE SHAFT

Doctor Isaacs and two AIDES drop down the shaft from the Weather

Station They are riding on the Hydraulic Platform Numbers

painted on the concrete walls let us know that we are 200 feet

underground A fresh Undead is held securely in a cage beside

them He wears a dirty RAIDERS jersey

INT CAVE

The platform comes to rest in a natural ROCK CAVE But this

place is littered with vehicles and high-tech equipment A
concrete road leads to a large set of BLAST DOORS

This is the entrance to THE COMPLEX a giant underground
facility belonging to the Umbrella Corporation

SLATER (0S)
Doctor

A MOTORIZED CART is parked by the hydraulic platform
ALEXANDER SLATER is waiting beside it Mid-twenties intense
His promotion through the Umbrella Science Division has been
swift He reeks of youthful arrogance

SLATER (CONTD)
The Committee was expecting you
fifteen minutes ago

Isaacs ignores him

SLATER (CONTD)
They were most insistent

DOCTOR ISAACS
(sighs)
Very well

He turns to his aides Indicates the Undead

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
Have it taken to my lab

He seats himself in Slaters motorized CART As though Slater
were nothing more than his driver --

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
Shall we

INT THE COMPLEX - BRIEFING ROOM

A dimly lit space filled with gleaming high-tech surfaces
Dominating the room is a huge representation of the Globe
showing Umbrella encampments all over the World They are like
a spiderweb spreading across the five continents Symbols
representing circling satellites show that Umbrella still have
control of the heavens

Sitting at a polished black conference table are a dozen
HOLOGRAPHIC FIGURES - representing the other Umbrella leaders -
German English French Spanish etc Umbrella always was a
global empire This is The Committee - the board that runs
Umbrella And at their head is COMMANDER OKAMOTO Mid-fifties
salt and pepper hair cut tight to his head Scars across his
knuckles tell of a life in the field before the desk beckoned
Okamoto is clearly in control here and hes a dangerous man to
cross

The Okamoto hologram glares at Doctor Isaacs as he enters
Theres clearly no love lost between these men Slater follows
at a discreet distance

DOCTOR ISAACS
Gentlemen

Isaacs talks to the holographic figures as if they were present
in the flesh They are startlingly lifelike - similar
technology to that employed in creating the image of the White
Queen

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
(sarcastic)
How good of the Science Division to
join us

DOCTOR ISAACS
Okamoto san I have been busy

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
Thats most interesting Because we
were just discussing the results of
your experiments or rather the
lack of them

DOCTOR ISAACS
Is that so

FRENCH ENVOY
On the subject of the Biohazard what
does the Science Division have to
report

DOCTOR ISAACS
We now know conclusively that they
have no real need for sustenance
They hunger for flesh but do not
require it

This is bad news It causes a rustle of debate amongst the
Committee Isaacs continues --

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
Unless exposed to extremes of
temperature or environment my
research indicates that they could
remain active for decades

SPANISH ENVOY

(outraged)
Decades Decades

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
And what of domestication What news
of Project Alice

DOCTOR ISAACS

Qur goals remain unchanged The
original Project Alice was unique
She bonded with the T-virus on a
cellular level somehow managed to
evercome it Using antibodies from
her blood we could develop a serum
that could not just combat the effects
of the T-virus but potentially
reverse it The power of this serum
would go far beyond the weak anti-
virus we have now For those not yet
infected the serum would offer

immunity And for the
Biohazard themselves a partial
reversal of the process Giving back
these creatures a measure of their
intelligence their memories curbing
their hunger for flesh

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
Youre confident you can domesticate
them

DOCTOR ISAACS
Why not They are animals
essentially We can train them if
we can take away their baser
instincts Theyll never be human
again but would provide the basis for
a docile workforce under our guidance
We would return to the surface and
create a new world order in our
image

FRENCH ENVOY
Pipe dreams After months of
experiments you have nothing to show
And we are left to rot underground

DOCTOR ISAACS
Without the original Project Alice
progress has been difficult
We have been forced to try and
replicate her using cloned genetic
models giving them selective
memories and actual physical stimuli
on the training floor

(MORE)

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
Trying to shortcut all the experience
that led her to the point of immunity
Its laborious and the results
unpredictable

FRENCH ENVOY
(aggressive)
Eighty five failures doctor

DOCTOR ISAACS
This is not an exact science

FRENCH ENVOY
I dont see much science at all

Okamoto steps in to stop the growing argument

COMMANDER OKAMOTO

Project Alice and the subject of
domestication is of the highest
priority

(to Isaacs)
You will concentrate on this to the
exclusion of all other research We
will expect an updated report within
the week

DOCTOR ISAACS
Simply demanding results will not
guarantee them

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
Then perhaps we should place someone
else in charge Someone who can give
us the reassurances we require

Isaacs is only too aware of Slater standing behind him

DOCTOR ISAACS
My work would proceed faster if we
could re-acquire the original test
subject

SPANISH ENVOY
I dont understand I thought the
original Project Alice was dead

SLATER

She is Theres been no trace of her
since the Detroit Incident

Isaacs doesnt turn to face Slater He keeps his attention on
The Committee - as if Slater didnt even exist Slater bristles
with the insult

DOCTOR ISAACS
There were several reports of
sightings

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
Unsubstantiated Shes been off the
grid for three years If she were
alive wed know about it

DOCTOR ISAACS
May I suggest

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
No You may not I wont waste our
resources chasing phantoms

Behind Isaacs Slater smiles

COMMANDER OKAMOTO (CONTD)
Continue with your research Doctor
And be quick about it While it still
is your research

CLOSE ON -- Isaacs’ hand beneath the table Unseen by the
others he holds a tiny digital voice recorder (similar in design
to the one we had seen with Alice) The tiny red led light
is on The device is RECORDING

INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY - LATER

The room is dark and silent as Doctor Isaacs enters In the
darkness this place cant help but resemble a modern take on a
medieval torture chamber Filled with devilish instruments and
devices

DOCTOR ISAACS
(dismissive)
Imbeciles
Isaacs places the tiny digital recorder on the docking station
of a desk top computer Some kind of SOUNDWAVE programme is
running on the computer He types in the following commands --
OKAMOTO COMMANDER VOICE PRINT ISOLATE

The computer begins to replay the conversation from the Briefing
Room

It isolates the voice of Commander Okamoto and then begins to
break his sentences down into individual words which it then
stores

Isaacs changes his jacket putting on a fresh lab coat

Suddenly an UNDEAD appears RIGHT BEHIND HIM Snarling and
biting

Isaacs brushes lint from his collar ignoring the creature
Only now do we see that it is the Raiders Undead and that he
has been secured to the lab wall by a length of chain The
Undead lunges for Isaacs but cant escape from the collar
around his neck and shackles on his arms

At last Isaacs turns to face the Undead Raiders fan The
creature is going crazy trying to reach the fresh meat just
inches away from it

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
(calm)
In good time

He turns away The depths of the lab are still cloaked in
darkness Isaacs hits a control switch and an endless bank of
fluorescents flicker into life This place is vast

What the lights reveal takes us completely by surprise A
hundred CRYO-STASIS TANKS each one containing a sleeping human
body Each of the bodies is naked And each is identical -

SATELLITE IMAGE --

Scanning across an abandoned freeway a desolate ARCO gas
station and the wilderness beyond The computer registers
movement in the gas station but identifies it as BIOHAZARD
and the satellite moves on

EXT DESERT - FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

A desolate ridge overlooking the Arco station No sign of life
Suddenly the BEEP of a digital watch breaks the silence and an
instant later the original Alice appears from under the camo
netting RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR NOSES She and the Fireblade had
been perfectly hidden Invisible to the satellite

Alice pulls a pair of binoculars from her saddlebags and studies
the abandoned Arco station A lone Undead wanders the
forecourt His name is written on his uniform - STEVIE At one
time he used to pump gas here

Alice replaces the binoculars and begins to assemble a deadly
looking CROSSBOW She loads it with a single steel bolt Alice
puts her eye to the telescopic sights of the crossbow

ALICE
Sorry about this Stevie

She fires and we PAN with the bolt as it streaks over a mile of
desert air Its an amazing shot that lands with deadly
precision Stevie is hit clean between the eyes The bolt
impacts with such force that the Undeads head is pinned to the
bodywork of a nearby Chevy Pick Up Truck

EXT DESERT - GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER

Alice rides into the abandoned ARCO station The BELL sounds as
she pulls up beside the pump Its a lonesome sound belonging
to a long dead World Stevie looks on with glazed eyes His
head is still nailed to the Chevy Pick Up Paco jumps out of
his saddlebag and smells the air He seems satisfied No
threat here

Alice hand cranks the gas pump She gets half a can of
gasoline but then nothing Not another drop

ALICE
Damn

She turns to see Paco staring up at her Quizzical

EXT FREEWAY - REST STOP NIGHT

The convoy has parked up for the night At a rest stop in the
middle of nowhere The safest place to be

The vehicles are circled Old West style - like a wagon train -
and the perimeter is lit by a blazing torches Its our future
but it could also be 100 years in the past

INT NEWS TRUCK NIGHT

The interior of the news truck has been modified to act as the
convoys COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTRE It is packed with radio
equipment and TV monitors An amiable geek a computer salesman
in his previous life sits at the controls Hes called Michael
MIKEY to his friends - and everyone here is his friend Hes
in his early twenties and we get the feeling that he likes his
new life a whole lot more than his old one

Valentine leans over his shoulder Mikey smiles flustered He
can survive the apocalypse but he still cant hide a crush

Carlos rides the perimeter on a modified DIRT BIKE He carries
a bundle of SENTINELS with him Each Sentinel is a 4 foot metal
pole with a bundle of electronics mounted to the top - including
a small infra-red video camera a motion sensor and a powerful
battery pack

From his command post Mikey can see every inch of the perimeter
thanks to the infra-red cameras mounted on the Sentinels The
motion sensors will also let him know if anything invades their
space

EXT REST STOP NIGHT

Valentine steps from the News Truck The camp is already alive
with activity Cooking fires being set People stretching
after so long on the road There must be forty people in all
All ages All backgrounds All held together by the desperate
hunger for survival

As Valentine walks through the camp we see that everyone knows
her everyone respects her She is their leader their savior
Valentine passes the mobile GENERATOR which provides electricity
to the camp A YOUNG WOMAN in a HELLO KITTY top is filling it
from a gas can She spills a little of the gasoline The
precious fuel dripping onto the desert floor

VALENTINE
Careful unless you want to go
drilling for that

So do we have gasoline or not

A hatch to the fuel tank is open A Nordic Giant - SVEN - pulls
a long measuring rod from within He wears a distinctive pair
of old AVIATOR GOGGLES around his neck

LJ
Hey Arnie

Sven examines the tip of the fuel rod A tiny bit of moisture
and a dozen flakes of rust He nods to the other vehicles

SVEN
If you can run those trucks on rust
then were in great shape

Valentine turns away This is very VERY bad news

Alice turns the radio OFF WIDEN to reveal that Alice has made
camp Just her and Paco

ALICE
What

The little dog is staring at her A silent moment between the
two of them

ALICE (CONTD)
You talk too much

EXT SCRUB LAND - LATER

Alice is lit by firelight She opens the RED JOURNAL she
discovered at the TV Station Idly she leafs through the
pages The last few make grim reading --

No food No water No one coming

There are flecks of dried blood on the page But as Alice goes
back through the journal things become more interesting --

Heard the transmission again Theyre broadcasting from a town
in Alaska No infection no Undead Theyre isolated
Safe

Again and again the writer talks about these transmissions from
the far North Alongside the entries there are pages torn from
magazines (National Geographic etc) and pasted into the
journal They show the town of ARCADIA The feature is about
Polar Bears but it also shows the town itself Beautiful
isolated a safe haven

Clearly the writer of the journal was obsessed about this place
Arcadia - the promised land - safe from the Undead

EXT SCRUB LAND - LATER

Paco sits close to the embers of the dying fire Not much heat
left there but the little dog is sucking up whatever remains
The Journal lies open to the page showing pictures of Arcadia
Alice lies to one side asleep But it is a troubled sleep

CLOSE ON HER EYELIDS as we see the REM - frantic and building
in intensity

ALICES DREAM -- we see fragments of her past The very end of
RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE Alice and the others (Carlos
Valentine LJ and Angie) escaping in the black SUV Doctor
Isaacs telling his men to active Programme Alice Umbrella
controlled ALICE VISION (seeing through her eyes) Is Alice
aware of Umbrellas control over her Or is it buried deep
within her subconscious fighting to get out

CLOSE ON PACO Watching Alice Concerned She mumbles in her
sleep

ALICES DREAM NEW FOOTAGE - the direct continuation of
RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE - what we didnt see --

The black SUV exits a freeway A road sign tells us that these
are the outskirts of DETROIT Something Slater had said earlier
echoes in our minds - Project Alice not having been seen since
The Detroit Incident

The SUV pulls into a nondescript warehouse Inside however is a
hive of activity This is the hub of the resistance against
Umbrella We see vehicles weapons sleeping quarters and
computers lots of computers There are dozens of people
working here - keeping track of all Umbrellas dirty dealings

As Alice is shown around introduced as a hero of the
resistance we see that something is wrong Everything she sees
is being transmitted straight back to Doctor Isaacs and Umbrella
via ALICE VISION She has become an unwitting spy in the midst
of the resistance

CLOSE ON PACO -- as the little dog notices something A stone
the size of his head is slowly rising into the air with no
visible means of support

CLOSE ON Alices eyelids REM building Her subconscious
working overtime

ALICES DREAM -- As the resistance headquarters is flooded with
light Black clad Umbrella Commandoes BURST through the
warehouse windows FLASH GRENADES blind the resistance
fighters They have been caught completely by surprise They
are cut down in a hail of gunfire LJ rushes a few survivors
out of a hidden emergency exit as Carlos and Valentine lay down
a suppressing fire

In the midst of the chaos Alice is unmoving Tears streaming
down her face She cradles the body of Angie in her arms The
young girl has been caught in the crossfire Shes dead

Alice screams but there is no sound --

CLOSE ON PACO -- as he sees more and more stones pebbles and
even boulders drifting up into the air A sudden metallic noise
makes the dog turn The Fireblade has left the ground It too
is rising up into the air saddlebags gasoline cans and all

CLOSE ON Alice Her breathing tortured REM reaching a
massive crescendo

Suddenly the embers of the campfire FLARE into life The raging
flames force Paco to his feet but around him more fires are
starting Bushes cacti patches of scrub are all BURSTING into
FLAME

Its too much for the little dog and he begins to BARK wildly

Alice wakes suddenly gun in hand ready for trouble As she
does the fires instantly extinguish and the boulders and rocks
fall back to the ground It is over in a second

It all happens so fast that you think Alice might have missed
it Until the Fireblade comes crashing to the ground lands
badly and rolls over onto its side

Paco look at Alice Her face is streaked with tears The
emotional wounds from the warehouse and the death of Angie as
raw today as they ever were

Alice wipes her eyes then stares at the blackened vegetation
The battered useless bike

ALICE
Shit

INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY NIGHT

FRENZIED JAWS SNAPPING AT THE CAMERA WIDEN to reveal the
Raiders Undead secured in a metal chair His hands and feet
bound by metal straps His head kept in place by a clamp to the
forehead Though the chair is fashioned in burnished high-tech
steel it has a strangely cruel medieval feel to it We almost
feel sorry for the Undead

Mounted to the back of the chair is an unusual SYRINGE It has
three needles Doctor Isaacs is loading it with an ampule of
cool green liquid - ANTI VIRUS

WHITE QUEEN (0S)
Doctor Isaacs

A small holographic representation of the White Queen 8 inches
in height hovers over a purpose built pad beside Isaacs’
computer She is the same little girl as always

DOCTOR ISAACS
What is it

WHITE QUEEN
Another test subject has failed the
training floor

DOCTOR ISAACS
Where

On the computer screen beside the White Queen an image of the
Glass Corridor comes up This is the place we saw the last
Alice Clone dodge the lasers Clearly this latest Clone has
not been so lucky The corridor is smeared with blood

WHITE QUEEN
At the laser grid

DOCTOR ISAACS
Damn it Theyre getting worse

WHITE QUEEN
Shall I ready another

DOCTOR ISAACS
Of course

WHITE QUEEN
This will be the eighty-seventh

DOCTOR ISAACS
(annoyed)
Your point

WHITE QUEEN
(emotionless)
I was merely making an observation

Isaacs looks at the video image of the Glass Corridor UMBRELLA

TECHS are now present They stand over the remains of the
latest Alice Clone

DOCTOR ISAACS
Tell them to take a sample of her
blood Then prepare a vaccine from
it Well use it on the next subject

Isaacs turns his attention back to the Raiders Undead strapped
to the chair

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
if this one doesnt work out

The syringe pushes into the back of the Undeads neck All
three needles penetrating deep within the flesh injecting the
Anti-Virus directly into the spinal cortex itself Its hard to
tell if an Undead feels pain But this sure looks like it As
the Undead writhes its eyes lock with those of its tormentor -
Doctor Isaacs The Raiders Undead glares at the Doctor

Burning Isaacs image into his primitive brain

But the Doctor just smiles coldly back at the creature He is
the master here

ANGLE ON --

The depths of Isaacs laboratory We are within the maze of
Cryo-Stasis tanks Each one containing a clone of Alice
floating in suspended animation In the distance the agonized
cries of the Raiders Undead can still be heard Suddenly one of
the tanks comes to life Unseen machines begin pumping air and
nutrients into the floating body They are bringing her to
life We see that there is a number etched into the glass of
the tank --

Number 87

EXT EMPTY FREEWAY DAY

A JACKRABBIT races across the blacktop closely pursued by Paco
The pursuit continues through the desert scrub until the rabbit
dives down a hole and Paco almost knocks himself out trying to
follow The dog shakes his head dazed Alice is watching the
comedy from a distance

ALICE
Go get him tiger

The rabbit pokes his head up 100 feet away from Paco Even he
seems to be watching the dog with amusement Paco gives up and
trots back to Alice She is walking the blacktop back to the
abandoned Arco Station After the events of last night the
Fireblade is clearly out of action Alice carries her
saddlebags radio and what is left of her gasoline in two cans
slung over her shoulder

EXT ARCO STATION - LATER
Alice gasses up the abandoned Chevy Pick Up After a few

attempts it starts Paco hops in the back as Alice pulls out
onto the Freeway

lying on the quiet forecourt Two large CROWS are hungrily
pecking away at the TAINTED FLESH

The Crows look up They have strangely GLAZED eyes
CUT TO
EXT DESERT RIDGE DAY

Valentine and Carlos lie on the crest of a steep ridge They
are flat to the ground so as not to give away their position
Through their BINOCULARS we see - a TRUCK STOP on the valley
floor below A faded sign proclaims it to be DESERT TRAIL
It consists of a cluster of buildings - motel restaurant gift
shop drive in theatre and most importantly a gas station

Many of the outlying structures are already half buried in the
desert sands Rolling dunes piling up against their walls
spilling in through the windows and doors In another year this
place will be completely gone The desert taking back its own

CARLOS
Seems quiet

He checks the gas station for signs of life but the doors and
windows are all securely boarded up Theres no sign of Undead
Carlos glances over his shoulder The convoy is parked at a
distance The people staring up a them Waiting for a
decision

CARLOS (CONTD)
(to Valentine)
Your call

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP DAY

The Hummer pulls up at the outskirts of the truck stop Beside
a signpost telling the distance to Las Vegas New York Paris
Rome Tokyo Peking Timbuktu the Moon etc

Valentine Carlos Sven and LJ emerge They are the advance
party Checking the coast is clear before the rest of the
convoy enters town

INT GAS STATION DAY
Valentine kicks open the door to the boarded up station The
stench hits her immediately And the flies Everywhere

Valentine enters at the ready gun in hand The other hand
covers her nose and mouth

As Valentine makes her way through the dreadful interior the
tension mounts She is on her guard But the rooms are gloomy
and filled with shadows - an oppressive sense of doom hangs over
the place On THE SOUNDTRACK the buzzing of the flies builds
in intensity Something is going to happen

BAM Valentine almost jumps out of her skin She has
accidentally knocked over a tray of pennies beside the cash
register

CLOSE ON the pennies as they roll across the floor

Valentine composes herself turns and RUNS STRAIGHT INTO A DEAD
BODY It is hanging from a makeshift noose The face hideous

and distorted Valentine has to fight the urge to wretch The
flies cling to the rotting meat or buzz around it in excitement

EXT GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Valentine exits in a hurry She can’t wait to gulp in the fresh
desert air She meets LJ on her way out

VALENTINE
Dont go in there

INT DESERT TRAIL MOTEL DAY

Carlos and Sven make their way through the abandoned motel
Sand from the mounting dunes has started to spill in through the
windows Carlos motions to Sven and they split up

INT MOTEL CORRIDOR DAY

Sven rounds the corner gun in hand At the rear of the motel
the sand has piled up above the roof blocking the light Sven
unhooks his flashlight and proceeds But with the darkness
comes a growing sense of dread

INT MOTEL - FRONT OFFICE DAY

Carlos passes peeling posters advertizing NEVADA — LAND OF
LEISURE

INT MOTEL CORRIDOR DAY

Sven pauses Hes in a long corridor with doors on both sides
He hears a feint noise behind one of the doors - ROOM 9 He
puts the flashlight on the ground and with his free hand tries
the door handle The door frame has warped in the heat and the
door wont budge Sven tries a little harder the door
begins to open slowly theres movement within the room
Sven raises his gun and --

BAM The door BEHIND Sven - on the opposite side of the
corridor explodes off its hinges and an UNDEAD HIGHWAY
PATROLMAN crashes into Sven Caught completely by surprise
Sven is forced through the doorway into Room 9 --

INT ROOM 9 — CONTINUOUS

In the gloom Sven crashes over the bed losing his gun in the
process He scrambles to his feet but the Undead Highway
Patrolman is on him in an instant As hard as Sven fights he
cannot push the Undead away In life this was a giant of a
man and in death he is even stronger He wears the typical
mirrored aviator glasses of a Patrolman and Sven can see his
own face reflected in them - as the Undead chokes the life out
of him

As Sven fights a losing battle he sees that the Patrolman still
wears a SIDEARM in his holster Sven reaches for it but cannot
lift the revolver free It is fastened firmly in place

In desperation Sven hooks his finger around the trigger of the
Patrolmans pistol He begins to fire The first three bullets
miss the Undead completely impacting harmlessly in the dirt
The fourth hits his foot but the Undead feels no pain and his
attack continues His teeth getting ever closer to Svens
throat

Sven pulls the trigger again The bullet goes clean through the
Undeads leg but has no effect

CLOSE ON THE REVOLVER - as the sixth and final bullet enters the
chamber This is Svens last chance

Sven pulls the trigger The bullet hits the Undeads kneecap
BLOWING IT CLEAN OFF The Undead buckles for a moment This is
all Sven needs Using the momentum of the Undead he spins it
around and SNAPS its neck

The Undead falls to the floor and Sven drops EXHAUSTED to the
motel bed After a moment catching his breath he notices his
own gun lying on the sandy floor right by his feet
SVEN
(shakes his head)
Son of a bitch
He reaches for his gun and --

THERE IS MOVEMENT BEHIND HIM

Sven spins gun in hand and fires at the Undead charging at him
The Undead DISAPPEARS accompanied by the sound of shattering
glass Too late Sven realizes that he has shot the REFLECTION
of the Undead He turns away from the BROKEN MIRROR but the
Undead behind him is just too close

Sven SCREAMS as the Undead bites into his forearm tearing out a
chunk He falls backwards off the bed but the Undead is
already on him hungry for more Sven is SPRAYED WITH BLOOD
For a moment he assumes it is his own but then the Undead
becomes limp and falls away to REVEAL - Carlos standing there
gun in hand

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP DAY

Valentine waves the all clear as the rest of the convoy pulls
in At the head of the vehicles is the Ambulance We see long
sharp blades mounted on its wheels like an Ancient Roman
Chariot The logo on the side of the Ambulance - TO HELP AND
SERVE - is sprayed with the dark blood of the Undead

A hot looking African American PARAMEDIC named BETTY (B to her
friends) steps from behind the wheel Like PAM GRIER reborn -
circa FOXY BROWN She wears two pistols on her hips and a
bandolier of ammo slung over her white tunic

We immediately like this girls style

We notice a logo on her worn out tunic - a pair of wings and
beneath it the lettering - CAA - CHICAGO AIRBORNE
AMBULANCE Back when the World had helicopter ambulances this
is how she worked A true angel of mercy

CLOSE ON CARLOS AND SVEN --

As they emerge from the Motel Sven leans heavily on his
friend Suddenly his knees buckle

SVEN
No more let me sit

Valentine catches sight of them as Carlos eases Sven to the
ground As Valentine starts to run towards them she calls out
to Betty --

VALENTINE
B B We need you over here

CLOSE ON B --

As she races over to Sven medical kit in hand Sven smilies
The sight of Betty would cheer even a dying man

SVEN

BETTY
Thats me Now lie back and relax

She produces a syringe and an ampule of morphine

BETTY (CONTD)
Im here to help

We get the feeling that this is Bettys catchphrase
INT DESERT TRAIL GIFT SHOP — CONTINUOUS

Through a dusty window we see people rushing to help Sven As
we watch the activity outside the CAMERA TRACKS across racks of
dusty merchandise Row upon row of COFFEE MUGS On each
theres a cartoon illustration of a SKELETON dancing while
wearing a ten gallon hat Behind the skeleton is a rough wooden
cross Beneath the illustration it reads --

CUT TO
INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY - TEST ROOM
A Spartan room attached to Isaacs laboratory The only
furniture is a metal table and chair The Raiders Undead sits
on the chair His arms are attached by metal cuffs and chains
to fastening points in the floor But there is enough slack in
the chains to allow him to stand if he wished
Doctor Isaacs another SCIENTIST and a LAB TECH stand over the
Undead Strangely the Undead does not seem disturbed by their
presence He makes no attempt to attack them Instead he is
focussed on the items placed on the table before him They are
things from everyday life --
A digital camera
A cell phone
A childs toy
The Raiders Undead goes for the cell phone first He picks it
up with surprising dexterity Regards it for a moment then
holds it to his ear

SCIENTIST
Amazing He knows what it is

DOCTOR ISAACS
The camera next

The Lab Tech pushes the digital camera towards the Undead He
picks up the camera Turns it in his hands Stares at it - as
if trying to remember

Then to everyones surprise he switches it on

SCIENTIST
loud)
My God

The sudden noise causes the Undead to look up The Scientist
takes a half step back Suddenly afraid

DOCTOR ISAACS
Stand your ground

The Scientist does as he is told The Raiders Undead stares at
the Scientist What is he thinking Is he even thinking at

all Then in one fluid move the Undead raises the camera and
takes a picture of the Scientist The Scientist is speechless

LAB TECH
(in awe)
Unbelievable

The Undead places the camera on the table We see the picture
of the surprised looking Scientist on its tiny VIEWING SCREEN
Then the Undead reaches for the childs toy It is a plastic
cube with square round and triangular holes into which
corresponding plastic shapes must be placed As the Raiders
Undead picks up the first of the plastic pieces we see the
distinctive three marks at the base of his neck - where Doctor
Isaacs had injected him

LAB TECH (CONTD)
Look at the dexterity He has memory
and reasoning skills

The Scientist picks up the digital camera Stares at his own
picture on the screen Still cant quite believe it

SCIENTIST
Its a miracle The serum works
Youve domesticated them Youve done
it
But as the men of science congratulate one another they fail to

notice that the Undead is having some difficulties He is
trying to fit the triangular piece into the circular hole

As his frustration builds his hand movements become less
coordinated He tries to force the piece home harder
harder

BAM The childs toy hits the far wall and shatters into a
hundred plastic pieces The Raiders Undead is on his feet
bellowing in rage The unfortunate Scientist is standing just
too close and is grabbed by the Undead

CLOSE ON -- the digital camera still in the hands of the
Scientist His picture on the viewing screen is SPRAYED with
his own blood

The Scientist falls to the floor his throat RIPPED OUT The
Lab Tech takes a step back out of reach of the Undead But the
Raiders Undead wrenches at his restraints with superhuman
strength Both bolts are RIPPED out of the concrete floor

The Lab Tech flees for the safety of the door only to find that
Doctor Isaacs is already closing it behind him

LAB TECH
No Please

But the door SLAMS sealing his fate The Undead is on him in
an instant Slamming the Lab Tech to the floor and DEVOURING
him with a savage terrifying hunger that we have never seen
before

Doctor Isaacs watches through the safety of a Plexiglas window
Its hard to tell if his emotions are for the death of his men
or the failure of his experiment

The burning torches which illuminate the camp are also caught in
the sudden wind One of them is even extinguished

VALENTINE
Hey Mikey

Mikey brightens when he sees Valentine

MIKEY
Jill

VALENTINE
Make sure that antennas secure
Looks like the winds picking up

INT DESERT TRAIL GIFT SHOP NIGHT

Its creepy in here as Valentine searches for cigarettes with
the aid of a flashlight But every machine she tries has been
raided already

As we watch Valentine from the depths of the store she suddenly
looks very isolated and vulnerable A sudden BANG makes
Valentine jump out of her skin The rising wind has slammed a
STORM SHUTTER against the window Valentine composes herself
and then continues the search UNSEEN by her we register those
strange souvenir mugs once again -- I saw the bones at Desert
Trail

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP NIGHT

At the outskirts of the truck stop large sand dunes have built
up The incoming storm has begun to blow the sand away however
revealing something buried below The tips of GRAVESTONES are
being uncovered Desert Trail is the home to a real Wild West
Boot Hill

Suddenly the souvenir mugs make sense

EXT DESERT TRAIL DRIVE IN NIGHT

Ld gets a mouthful of sand courtesy of the rising winds He
spits it out then takes a swig of beer

Ld
Remember when beer was cold

K-MART
Not really

Lid
I miss that

EXT DESERT TRAIL CEMETERY NIGHT

As Undead hands begin to PUNCH through the desert sand the wind
rises revealing half decayed faces the skin cracked and dried
without an ounce of moisture These old twisted bodies are
truly horrific - youve never seen Undead like this before

Even more terrifying however as the dead begin to walk we see
that they are already WITHIN the perimeter of Sentinels

INT NEWS TRUCK NIGHT

Mikey is still broadcasting Around him we see the video feeds
from the Sentinels They show nothing but empty desert - all
the cameras and motion sensors are pointed OUT

The convoy is completely unaware of the impending danger
EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP - GAS STATION NIGHT

The Young Woman in the Hello Kitty top stands by the Arco
Tanker Shes keeping watch as the tanker is filled from
multiple gas pumps The sound of machine-gun fire drifts over
from the Drive In Seagal wreaking havoc Hello Kitty glances
over at the giant movie screen Shed rather be watching the
film but she has a job to do

The Master Fuel Gauge on the tanker almost reads full when
suddenly all of the pumps die simultaneously

Hello Kitty gets to her knees and drops a GLOW STICK into the
underground reservoir beneath the gas station It illuminates
the giant gasoline tank Theyve sucked it bone dry

As Hello Kitty straightens up we REVEAL an Undead directly
behind her

The Undead lunges biting deep into her neck Hello Kitty is
sprayed with blood An Uzi on a strap hangs from her shoulder
She fights to bring the gun around to bear on the Undead but
her hands are slippery with her own blood The Uzi fires but
the shots go wide The Undead forces Hello Kitty to the ground
and the fight goes out of her

CLOSE ON -- The Arco Tanker The stray shots from the Uzi have
ruptured the newly filled Tanker Gasoline is pouring from the
holes and soaking the ground around the vehicle

EXT DESERT TRAIL DRIVE IN - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON -- Seagal as he wastes another unfortunate stuntman
The Gunfire from the movie has drowned out the noise of the Uzi
LJ takes another sip of beer The convoy is still unaware of
the danger

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP - PERIMETER - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON -- one of the Sentinels as it suddenly bursts into
life An alarm wailing as its motion sensors pick up something

INT DESERT TRAIL GIFT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Valentine hears the feint whine of the alarm carried on the
wind

VALENTINE

She grabs her Walkie as she races for the door
VALENTINE (CONTD)
(into walkie)
Mikey

Valentine opens the door and comes FACE TO FACE with an Undead
The Undead attacks and Valentine drops the walkie in shock

INT NEWS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Mikey replies over the radio unaware that Valentine is in
trouble The control board before him is suddenly alive with
activity

MIKEY
Theres something incoming

A second then a third Sentinel sets off its alarm

MIKEY (CONTD)
Something Big

Mikey grabs a SHOTGUN from a rack on the wall He bursts out of
the News Truck to see --

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

The Chevy Pick Up screams to a halt It is shrouded in a cloud
of dust This is what set off the alarms

Alice steps from the vehicle A dark silhouette outlined in
the headlights A MYTHIC FIGURE Mikey shoulders his shotgun
still unsure of who it is

ALICE
Im not your problem

There is a small searchlight mounted to the drivers side of the
Pick Up Alice swings it to one side The beam illuminates an
army of Undead already in the camp

MIKEY
Oh shit

Mikey fires at the first of the Undead Half its head
DISINTEGRATES There is no blood or fleshy brain just dry
desiccated tissue AND THE UNDEAD JUST KEEPS WALKING Half its
head gone but its still moving

ALICE
Theyre too far gone

SLOW MOTION as Alice pushes the tails of her duster coat to one
side She wears two KUKRI strapped to her waist These long
GURKHA MACHETES are unique Incredibly difficult to master but
the deadliest blades in the world

The Undead with half a head reaches for Alice His half mouth
opening wide revealing shattered teeth In an instant his
severed HANDS and then what remains of his HEAD hit the desert
sand His lifeless body follows a moment later

ALICE (CONTD)
(to Mikey)
Sever the spinal column

Alice holds a Kukri in either hand

ALICE (CONTD)
kill all the motor functions

Without hesitation she charges the Undead Outnumbered fifty to
one her duster TWIRLING in the wind the blades SPINNING around
her in a lethal arc Alice is a blur of deadly motion And
wherever she moves Things die

EXT DESERT TRAIL GIFT SHOP - CONTINUOUS
Valentine struggles with her Undead eventually managing to push
it back In the moments respite she draws her sidearm and

fires She has to empty an entire clip into the creature before
it finally falls

Very little remains of its head but still the Undead claws its
way across the floor to Valentine It couldnt bite her it no
longer has a mouth to speak of - but its instinct to kill
overrides all else

VALENTINE
(shocked)
My God

Valentine backs away from the Undead reloads and finishes the
job

INT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

Sven hears the sound of gunfire from outside He tries to get
up to help his friends but he is held in place by the
handcuffs attached to the gurney

SVEN
Damn it

As the sound of battle grows Sven becomes increasingly angry
Pulling at the cuffs tearing at the gurney threatening to pull
the whole ambulance apart

EXT DESERT TRAIL DRIVE IN - CONTINUOUS

LJ reacts to the gunfire The noise of the movie can no
longer mask the sound of real gunshots He pushes K-Mart behind
him for protection and reaches for his signature 45s

In the car beside LJ the two occupants are suddenly grabbed
by the Undead Caught completely off guard they are TORN APART
in an instant LJ opens fire In the blink of an eye it
seems like there are Undead everywhere

INT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

The adults on board grab their guns and head out Otto locks
the door behind them to protect the handful of children that
remain He draws his gun Despite his stoner appearance Otto
still knows his way around a Magnum

EXT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

Carlos and Betty cover each others backs as they blaze away
But the Undead are almost impossible to stop Even with gaping
holes in them they continue to advance As Betty reloads an
Undead grabs her Its teeth are at her throat in an instant

Sven BURSTS from the back of the Ambulance part of the gurney
still dangling from his wrist

Hes in terrible shape but hes not going to let anything
happen to Betty He SLAMS something into the back of the
Undeads head and it slowly relaxes its grip on Betty and sinks
to the ground

CLOSE ON the Undead as we see a handful of razor sharp
SCALPELS embedded in its spinal column

All around people race for their weapons and their vehicles
Its chaos

CLOSE ON Alice -- in the midst of the Undead standing at the
center of a Circle of Death Nothing comes within five feet of
her without feeling the steel of her blades

But the humans are fighting a losing battle

Carlos is out of ammo as an Undead charges him Carlos stops it
in its tracks with a devastating ROUNDHOUSE kick The Undead
staggers back into one of the flaming torches that light the
camp He goes up in flames in an instant These creatures are
bone dry

CLOSE ON Carlos -- his face lit by the fire -- as he realizes
these creatures weak spot

CARLOS
(shouting above the noise of
battle)
Burn them

The Undead before him staggers to its knees and then keels over
A blazing inferno

CARLOS (CONTD)
BURN THEM

CLOSE ON Alice -- as she registers his voice Even in the midst
of battle we see the relief in her eyes - Carlos is still
alive

CARLOS (CONTD)
We have to burn them

Alice glances at the Fire Truck and its twin mounted flame
throwers but it is already overrun with Undead No way to
reach it Carlos has identified a weakness in the Undead but
they cant exploit it The humans are cut off and surrounded -
unable to get to the handful of blazing torches that the desert
storm has left alight

One by one the humans are being dragged down by the Undead
The screams of the dead and dying fill the night air

CLOSE ON Alice -- as she begins to concentrate The deadly
Kukris still spin around her but her attention is somehow
turned INWARD

CLOSE ON her eyes -- as we see her pupils DILATE This is
exactly how she looked when she awoke from her dream in the
desert She is accessing some dark part of herself A place
she usually tries to keep under lock and key A part of her
mind that only dwells in her subconscious

The sound of the battle slips away Now there is only a strange
silence Alice closes her eyes and we see the sudden intense
REM from the other night

CLOSE ON one of the blazing torches -- as the flame suddenly
intensifies Its like someone has poured gasoline on the fire
The flame jumps into the air and then TURNS IN ON ITSELF

The flame begins to TWIST and SPIRAL around the burning torch
Ignoring the desert wind moving of its own will Its both
beautiful and terrifying to behold

And then suddenly the fire BURSTS forth The flame jetting like
liquid napalm between the Undead Striking them with such
intensity that the flame almost seems to punch through them

CLOSE ON Alice -- the REM reaching a crescendo as the fire
jumps from one Undead to another with incredible speed

And suddenly her eyes SNAP OPEN And Alice falls to her knees
The Kukris fall beside her She no longer has the strength to
hold them HER BODY AND MIND SPENT WITH THE SUPERHUMAN EFFORT

Around her Alice sees an inferno The Undead are ablaze
Illuminating the camp with a hellish light Its like an image
from Blake at his darkest Charred and blackened bodies
literally falling apart

CLOSE ON Sven - as he sees a new danger Using the last of his
strength he races towards the Arco Tanker Carlos is still
dealing with the remaining Undead - who were not caught in the
firestorm He sees his friend running for the tanker

CARLOS (CONTD)
Sven

SVEN
The fuel

Only now does Carlos see what Sven already knows Gasoline is
pouring from the tanker - where it was ruptured by the stray
gunshots from Hello Kitty Sven splashes through a giant pool
of Gasoline that surrounds the Tanker If any one of the
blazing Undead make contact with this then the Tanker and the
whole encampment would be vaporized in an instant

INT TANKER - CAB - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON Sven -- as he hauls himself into the cab He cries out
in pain clutching his wound It has re-opened soaking his
torso in blood His face is deathly pale

EXT TANKER - CONTINUOUS

The engine roars into life the gears grinding But the Tanker
doesnt move

CLOSE ON the pool of gasoline -- as REFLECTED in its surface we
see the blazing outline of an Undead as it staggers closer
Still the Tanker hasnt moved

CARLOS
Sven

But there is no reply The Tanker remains in place the engine
idling The blazing Undead drawing ever closer And its not
alone At any moment any one of the Undead could stagger into
the gasoline and set the whole Tanker afire Sven has to move
the Tanker away from the encampment But still it just sits
there Engine idling Carlos tries to break free but he is
still battling the last few Undead

CARLOS (CONTD)
For Gods Sake Sven

CLOSE ON Alice -- as she hears Carlos calling out She looks up
at the Tanker Sees the gasoline the blazing Undead the
imminent disaster And with superhuman effort she forces
herself to her feet Dodging past the fiery Undead Alice races
to the tanker

CLOSE ON Carlos as he recognizes the running figure We see the
excitement in his eyes Alice is back

INT TANKER - CAB
Alice wrenches open the door and leaps aboard The engine is
running but Sven is nowhere to be see In the WING MIRROR --

the reflection of a blazing Undead right on the edge of the
pool of gasoline

Alice slams the Tanker into gear just as UNDEAD SVEN lunges from
the back of the cab Alice pushes him away but she is in a
weakened state The massive Nordic Undead presses forward
Alice seems unable to stop him

Suddenly Paco LEAPS at Sven The dog has followed Alice

Paco is small but furious and fights fearlessly in defence of
his owner The sudden impact of the dog tips the balance and
drives Sven back Both Paco and the Undead tumble from the
moving Tanker

Alice floors the gas pedal

EXT TANKER - CONTINUOUS

Paco and Sven hit the ground the little dog rolling away from
the Undead As Sven gets to his feet he comes face to face
with his old friend - Carlos

CARLOS
Im sorry

Without hesitation Sven lunges for the fresh meat and Carlos
shoots his friend neatly between the eyes IN SLOW MOTION - as
Svens body falls away from Carlos the two figures are suddenly
silhouetted by a WALL OF FIRE that ERUPTS behind them A
burning Undead has connected with the lake of gasoline The
Undead is vaporized in an instant

Carlos watches in horror as the fire races after the Tanker
INT TANKER - CAB - CONTINUOUS

Alice looks in the Wing Mirror and sees the fire coming The
Tanker is leaking gasoline and the flames are chasing the trail
hungrily

Alice grinds the gas pedal into the floor

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

The Tanker barrels past Its going fast but the flames are
gaining

INT TANKER - CAB CONTINUOUS
Alice races past the last of the convoys vehicles Scared
faces stare at her from the windows of the School Bus Otto is

doing his best to calm the children but they are in a full on
panic

In the Wing Mirror Alice sees that the fiery tail has almost
caught up with the tanker But Alice cant bail out yet Shes
still too close to the School Bus

EXT TANKER - CONTINUOUS
The flames reach the giant tank of gasoline
EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

CARLOS
Alice

Carlos watches helplessly as the Tanker is torn apart in a GIANT
EXPLOSION The faces in the School Bus window duck as the glass
is sprayed with burning droplets of gasoline

They survived Just

The burning drops of gasoline crack the glass of the school bus
and eat into the rubber trim around it A small detail but it
will be significant later

CLOSE ON Carlos -- as he shields himself from the searing heat
of the explosion When he looks up there is nothing much left
of the tanker or the cab

HOLD on Carlos - thinking he has lost Alice for good

Then a miracle -- from the wall of flame walks Alice Clothes
and skin scorched and burnt But still alive Delighted
Carlos wraps her up in a bear like embrace

CARLOS (CONTD)
I thought you were dead

CLOSE ON Alice -- we see her joy at reuniting with Carlos But
theres something else Under the surface An awkwardness
Its been a long time since she was even with people never mind
physical contact

Carlos looks around at the devastation

CARLOS (CONTD)
Well Ill say one thing for you

Burning debris from the Tanker is still raining down everywhere
CARLOS (CONTD)

You still know how to make an
entrance

Alice laughs And then almost immediately keels over
Exhausted from her efforts - both physical and mental

And Carlos is there to stop her from falling
CUT TO
EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP SUNRISE

Daybreak is breathtaking but no one here is in a mood to
appreciate it In the daylight we see the true extent of the
damage Many of the vehicles are write-offs Still more are
badly damaged At the edge of the encampment the survivors
stand around a dozen fresh graves with simple wooden markers

VALENTINE
Anyone want to say something

But none of the crowd speak Their spirits broken

VALENTINE (CONTD)
Well then

Valentine heads back to the encampment After a beat the others
begin to trail after her Only Carlos remains He hangs Svens
distinctive Aviator Goggles over one of the crosses

CARLOS
Be seeing you

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP LATER

A solemn air hangs over the camp as the survivors attempt to
repair the remaining vehicles

INT AMBULANCE DAY

Alice lies unconscious Betty has cut away her tattered clothes
to reveal a body ravaged with burns and wounds Betty is
applying salve to a raw burn on Alices neck SUDDENLY Alices
hand SNAPS up and grabs Bettys wrist Startled Betty tries to
jump back but Alices grip is like iron Alice has enough
sedative in her to tranquilize a horse Yet her eyes are sharp
and focussed Her movements precise

ALICE
Dont

She relaxes her grip Realizing Betty is in pain

ALICE (CONTD)
touch me

BETTY
Your wounds
ALICE
(cuts her short)
Are fine

Alice unhooks the IV drip from her arm and sits up She
notices a bracelet made of electrical wire on her left wrist
Where the hell did that come from

BETTY
If theyre not treated they could
become infected

But Alice is oblivious She stands up

BETTY (CONTD)
You need to rest

Alice isnt listening B is a forceful woman but no match for
this girl In a corner lie the smouldering remains of what used
to be Alices clothes

ALICE
Got anything I could wear

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP DAY

We PAN up Alices legs as she steps from the Ambulance Shes
dressed in one of Bs nurses outfits Its not an unpleasant
sight Paco joins her immediately The faithful hound had been
waiting outside the ambulance door Alice walks over to her
pick-up truck She checks her stuff - radio and saddlebags - it
all seems to be in order

VALENTINE (0S)
I thought you were dead

Alice looks up to see Valentine Jill doesnt seem too happy to
see her old friend

ALICE
Disappointed

From Jills expression its hard to tell

VALENTINE
What brought you back

ALICE
You did Ive been

monitoring your

transmissions When I heard you were

here I didnt have
to come

She reaches inside one of her

a choice I had

saddlebags

ALICE (CONTD)
Ive been here before

Alice tosses her something Jill catches it Its a corny
fridge magnet -- I saw the bones at Desert Trail

ALICE (CONTD)
knew what was waiting

VALENTINE

What happened in Detroit

ALICE

You know what happened They used me

VALENTINE

A lot of good people died that night

ALICE
Thats why I had to

VALENTINE
How

ALICE

disappear

I broke into an Umbrella facility
Hacked into their computers and
downloaded the satellite trajectories
I stayed off the grid Ceased to

exist

Suddenly Alice looks down at her watch But its gone Melted

in last nights fire

ALICE (CONTD)

(worried)
What time is it

VALENTINE

K-MART (0S)
I heard about you

K-Mart is sharing the shade with her Alice prepares to ignore
this minor nuisance

K-MART (CONTD)
They said you were dead

A flicker of a smile crosses Alices face

K-MART (CONTD)
What

ALICE
I get that a lot

Alice holds up her wrist The one with the wire bracelet Its
just like the ones that K-Mart wears

ALICE (CONTD)
This belong to you

K-MART

ALICE

Looks like it worked What do they

call you

K-Mart Its where they found me

Jill and the other few years back
ALICE

You have a name before that
KMART

Never liked it And everyone I knew

was dead seemed like the time for

a change

ANGLE ON -- the kids in the school bus A half dozen eager
faces staring at Alice in awe They duck out of sight when she
looks their way

ALICE
Whats up with them

K-MART
They didnt think you were real The
kids tell stories about you at night
Like youre Shrek or Dracula
something like that

8 Despite herself Alice is warming to K-Mart

ALICE
You remind me of someone

K-MART
Really What happened to her

ALICE
I let her die

The young girl doesnt seem phased by this at all --

K-MART
(shrugs)
Hope you dont make the same mistake

twice

ANGLE ON -- Alices shadow as she and K-Mart talk The sun is
moving rapidly across the sky and Alices shadow is shifting
creeping out from the shade of the porch and onto the desert
sand

SATELLITE IMAGE --

The Umbrella satellite has almost passed clean over the Truck
Stop

But in the last few seconds it registers the barest hint of
Alices shadow In an instant the computer tracks in
enhancing the shadow filling in the missing data creating a
profile in silhouette and comparing it to millions of possible
matches in its data bank A second later it comes to its
conclusion --

have a strike team ready within the
hour

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
No Well establish a positive
identification first One hundred
percent

DOCTOR ISAACS

The group shes with include Jill
Valentine and Carlos Olivera known
associates

Isaacs is becoming increasingly impassioned --

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
The original Project Alice is vital to
my research To the whole process of
domestication her blood her
genetic structure is the key The
longer we leave her out there the
greater the chance we lose her again
I cant risk that

Okamoto is furious - Isaacs has completely overstepped his
authority

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
That decision is not yours to make
Youll take no action till this matter
has been discussed by The Committee

from the convoy Mikey holds the Red Journal in his hands
Its open to the pages showing Arcadia - the promised land

VALENTINE (CONTD)

Mikey holds up the Journal

MIKEY

These transmissions

VALENTINE

Are dated from six months ago How
Many radio broadcasts have we
responded to How many times have we
got there too late

ALICE
The transmissions said there was no
infection up there
Valentine indicates the convoy at large

VALENTINE
These people dont need pipe dreams

CARLOS
Maybe

So far Carlos has been silent Now all eyes are on him

CARLOS (CONTD)
thats exactly what they need

VALENTINE
What

CARLOS
Look at them Jill Six months ago
there were fifty of us Then forty-
five Now barely thirty

We see SHOTS of members of the convoy They are all extremely
tired Exhausted by the constant movement the constant battle

CARLOS (CONTD)
Theyre starting to give up They
need some hope

VALENTINE
This kind of hope could get them all
killed

EXT DESERT TRAIL TRUCK STOP - LATER

Valentine stands on the back of the flatbed truck All the
members of the convoy are assembled Its like a town meeting

VALENTINE

We have a decision to make Its
too big too important for me to make
it for you Theres a chance there
are survivors in Alaska Theres
a chance the infection hasnt reached
that far But we dont know for sure
So we have a choice We stay as we
are Or we try for Alaska

She pauses for a moment then puts it to the vote --

VALENTINE (CONTD)
For Alaska

Almost every hand is raised Valentine can see the excitement
in their eyes A germ of hope Something that has been missing
for years

VALENTINE (CONTD)
Alright then

As Valentine steps down from the flatbed she passes Alice

VALENTINE (CONTD)
I hope youre right

isolating Okamotos voice and breaking his sentences down into
individual words --

Isaacs sits down before the computer and enters the command --
COMPOSE

Isaacs then begins to type The Computer plays back whatever he
types in Okamotos voice We recognize many of the soundbites
from Commander Okamotos previous conversations with Isaacs
Slowly a coherent sentence is built --

dry over the last six months We have
to hit a big city Besides

Valentine glances over at the still smoking wreckage of the oil
tanker

VALENTINE (CONTD)

in

He glances at K-Mart - sleeping in the back of the cab Asleep
her face looks the picture of innocence

CARLOS
You ever think were the freaks

ALICE
What do you mean

Carlos glances out at the every growing numbers of Undead

CARLOS
That we are the anomalies the last
of the dinosaurs We fucked up our
world and so the world fucked us
back

He stares at the mass of Undead as they race past Men women
children Black White Asian Everyone is represented

Look at them This is their world
now We dont belong here

Alice shakes her head

ALICE
Believe that if you want But Im not
ready to surrender to the new world

She opens the Red Journal Takes out a cutting of Arcadia
beautiful fairy-tale town Alice pins it to the sun visor
above her

ALICE (CONTD)
Theres an end to this Im sure of
it

Theres a moments silence Carlos stares at her Alice
shifts uncomfortable --

ALICE (CONTD)
What

CARLOS
Why did you disappear After Detroit

Carlos tries to keep it hidden But he clearly still harbors
feelings for Alice

ALICE
I didnt have a choice I couldnt be
around you Any of you Id have
gotten you all killed

CARLOS
And after the World ended Why stay
out there Alone

ALICE

(shrugs)
Habit

Its a weak excuse and they both know it

CARLOS
Could you be more evasive

ALICE
(smiles)
I could try

But despite Alices attempt to make a joke out of it Carlos is
not going to let it go He stares at her Expecting a reply

ALICE (CONTD)
Im better out there Alone Okay

CARLOS
Why cant you talk to me about this

ALICE
There are some things
(hesitates)
I dont understand I cant
control
Its hard for her to talk about this To confront the
uncertainty of her own identity Her growing powers Her
evolution

ALICE (CONTD)
Its safer if Im not around people

Before Carlos can ask more the vehicle in front comes to an
abrupt halt Alice slams on the brakes Before them is a large
faded sign half buried in the desert sands --

blocked completely - only the tops of the telegraph poles
letting us know that they existed at all

We see the roofs of tall buildings poking out of the sand

Signs for Burger King and Taco Bell float above the dunes but
there is no sign of the buildings that they once advertised

INT FLAT BED CONTINUOUS
K-Mart stares in awe at the remnants of the buried city

K-MART
Where is it

ALICE
Guess the desert wanted it back

She reaches for her walkie
INT HUMMER - CONTINUOUS

Alices voice comes over Valentines walkie

ALICE (0S)
Were going to have to check the
Strip See if anythings left there

VALENTINE
The Strip great

This just gets better and better
EXT CROW ROAD DAY

The convoy turns into a long street lined with telegraph poles
But unlike the journey here there is no sign of the Undead

INT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

Betty is at the wheel LJ now without a vehicle rides
beside her Betty fingers her 45 nervously

BETTY
Where are they

She glances at LJ He shares her concern Where are the
Undead

EXT CROW ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Still no sign of life

As the convoy passes we CRANE DOWN to reveal a skeletal hand
poking from the desert sands Then another then another

This place is a charnel house Hundreds of SKELETONS picked to
the BONE

And however these people died it wasnt pleasant The bodies
are bent and twisted Their unmoving skeletal fingers are the
shape of claws

They died in agony

INT FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS

K-Mart stares at the surrounding buildings Tension mounting

EXT CROW ROAD - CONTINUOUS

HIGH ANGLE looking down at the convoy We see a huge black CROW
perched on a telegraph pole Silently watching

INT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

LJ sees a dozen crows perched on another pole Then still
more nestled in a smashed window frame Even more resting on
the roof of a burnt out car

They are everywhere

Ld
What the fuck

And there arent dozens of crows there are hundreds of them
perhaps thousands

EXT CROW ROAD - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON - a dark black crow Watching

It has the same strange glazed eyes as the ones we saw at the
Arco Station - in the birds that were feasting on the remains of
Stevie

INT FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS

K-MART
Whats with all the birds

Alice looks up and sees the crows Notices a human skeleton
half buried in the desert sand Suddenly realizes --

ALICE
Theyve been feeding on tainted flesh

She grabs the walkie
ALICE (CONTD)
Roll up your windows Dont let them
get the scent
INTEXT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

ALICE (0S)
Roll up your windows right now

OTTO
Okay You heard the lady

The occupants of the school bus - a half dozen kids and three
adults - hasten to do as they are told

CLOSE ON --

The window of the school bus as it shuts We see where the
glass was cracked by the burning gasoline The rubber moulding
around the window was also eaten away by the heat

Remember I told you this would be important

For now the window doesnt shut properly There is a gap
between the glass and rubber seal

CLOSE ON -- the gap Then suddenly THE CAMERA races up and
away Drifting through space Coming to rest on one of the
giant crows The Creature turns towards the bus And suddenly
TAKES FLIGHT

INT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

All around a thousand crows take to the air The sound is
deafening Terrifying

BETTY
Whats going on

INT FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS

Alice watches the crows circling above The birds are reflected
in the windshield like a ominous black cloud

ALICE
(into the walkie)
Floor it
EXT ARIEL SHOT - CONTINUOUS
We are looking straight down on the convoy perhaps two hundred
feet below The vehicles kick up dust as they pick up speed

Suddenly streaking through frame in a blur of darkness are the
crows

Swirling like a giant storm cloud above the convoy
INT FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS
Alice glances up
ALICE
Theyre territorial we just have

to keep going

CARLOS
How do you know theyre territorial

ALICE
Saw it on the Discovery Channel

CARLOS
(looks up)
I hope they know that

EXT CROW ROAD — CONTINUOUS

The first of the vehicles has almost reached the end of the
street when suddenly the crows attack

The swirling cloud becomes like a giant black arrow aimed
straight at the school bus

INTEXT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

The first of the crows smashes against the windshield and
bounces off So does the second and the third But in an
instant there are dozens and then hundreds of the birds
impacting against the glass The entire windshield is dark
like night had suddenly fallen

Otto cant see where hes going and the bus crashes into a
telegraph pole The kids SCREAM as the glass of the windshield
begins to crack Otto holds it in place

OTTO
Help me

The other adults in the bus rush to help him They hold the
windshield in place and the tide of crows in check Just

INT FLAT BED — CONTINUOUS
Alice looks back Sees the school bus Unmoving Besieged

ALICE
Damn it

The flatbed is already at the end of the street but Alice hauls
on the wheel and the truck spins through 180 degrees headed
right back into the danger zone

INT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

The windshield begins to give way Several crows slip into the
bus adding to the chaos and confusion Their beaks tearing at
the adults flesh There are deafening gunshots within the
close confines of the vehicle

The children cower at the back of the bus SCREAMING IN TERROR
74

INTEXT FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS

The flat bed pulls up as close as it can to the back door of the
school bus Carlos throws open his door Indicates to one of
the adults in the bus to do the same

A narrow corridor between the flat bed and the school bus is
created - protected by the vehicle doors on both sides but open
at the top and bottom

Several crows dive down into the gap but Carlos blows them out
of the sky with a 12 gauge Carlos shouts to be heard over the
deafening storm of wings

CARLOS
The children Get them over here

INT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

An adult shepherds the kids towards the open back door They
are terrified of staying in the bus but even more terrified of
going outside Behind them the windshield is giving way Otto
and the others cant hold it in place much longer

CARLOS (0S)
Hurry

INT FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS

One by one the children begin to make the terrifying crossing
between the two vehicles Carlos catching them as they jump
across The crows circle menacingly above

ALICE
(to K-Mart)
Take the wheel

K-Mart does as shes told and Alice slides across to the open
door Within a second both her guns are blazing as she shoots
the attacking crows out of the sky

INT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

The windshield finally gives way The bus is suddenly filled
with flapping wings and bloody tearing beaks Otto and the
other adults are engulfed

INT FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS

Alice grabs the last of the kids An adult screams at them from

the doomed school bus Hes already covered in crows Beyond
helping

ADULT
Go

Carlos turns to K-Mart

CARLOS
Floor it

K-Mart hits the gas as Carlos slams the truck door Several
crows impact with the door breaking their bones but cracking
the glass Alice holds a weeping traumatized child in her
arms Behind them --

EXT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

Otto leaps from the stricken bus but there are a dozen birds
already on him By the time he has hit the ground we can barely
see him He is a heaving mass of ravenous crows

INT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

Now with the back door open the interior of the bus becomes
like a wind tunnel Hundreds of birds racing through the bus at
high speed their beaks stained red with blood

The screams of the dying are drowned out by the beating of a
thousand pairs of wings

EXT CROW ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Then as quickly as it had begun it is over And the crows
settle back onto their perches

EXT FLAT BED CONTINUOUS

K-Mart glances in the rear view Looking back at the school
bus horrified

INT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

Thirty seconds ago there were human beings in here What
remains of them now you dont really want to know

EXT CROW ROAD CONTINUOUS
HIGH ANGLE looking down In the distance the flat bed reaches
the end of the street With the crows back on their perches a

strange calm has descended over the street Almost like nothing
happened

In the FOREGROUND a crow watches silently Its beak freshly
moistened

CUT TO
EXT THE STRIP DAY

Like a rising tide the desert sands have enguifed the giant
casinos Where New York New York once stood only the top of
the Empire State Building and the Statue Of Liberty poke out
from the dunes Further down the street a half buried Eifel
tower is visible The lake in front of the Bellagio is choked
with sand Its a weird surreal landscape with just one
exception --

The giant Sphinx outside the Luxor has never looked more at
home

EXT MGM GRAND - CONTINUOUS

Atop the sand dunes that surround the casino stands a real
AFRICAN LION He has escaped from the wildlife preserve inside
and lives as a scavenger His bones are showing through his
skin The Lion watches the convoy below He licks his lips
hungrily But makes no move to attack There are worse things
than being hungry And those things are to be found in the
heart of Vegas

EXT THE STRIP - CONTINUOUS

The convoy rolls to a halt at the top of the Strip Abandoned
vehicles litter the road Many of them also half swallowed by
the encroaching desert Amongst them is a tanker carrying
Canola Oil

EXT HUMMER - CONTINUOUS

The Hummer pulls up beside the Canola Oil tanker Valentine
leaps out

VALENTINE
Thatll do

LJ
Im on it

LJ opens up the valves on the tanker Cooking oil gushes out
into the street K-Mart climbs up into the cab

K-MART
Ill get it started

The others set up a defensive perimeter around the tanker
CLOSE ON CARLOS --
He lowers his binoculars

CARLOS
Nothing

Theres no sign of life Living or (un)dead Just the
occasional bleached skeleton half buried in the sand

ALICE
Those birds must have moved through
the city block by block picked it

clean
Carlos and Alice share a look As horrific as the Undead are
theres something even more unsettling about the completely
deserted city
EXT THE STRIP - LATER

The convoy is back on the move the tanker now in tow They are
headed deeper into the heart of Las Vegas

INT AMBULANCE DAY

LJ stares at the abandoned Strip The centre divider is lined
with the dead husks of palm trees

LJ
There

He points to the Piazza San Marco and what remains of the
Venetian Casino Its waterways are long since choked with sand
its gondolas beached and useless

LJ (CONTD)
There Theres a gas pump in there

Between the dunes the entrance to Valet Parking (under the
Ponte dei Sospiri) remains accessible

BETTY
How do you know

LJ
Dropped two g here back in the day

BETTY
(whistles)
Two grand Mister High Roller

EXT THE VENETIAN CASINO - VALET MINUTES LATER

The Canola Oil Tanker is pulled up by the gas pumps Every
available hose has been dropped into the tanker Valentine and
the others are hand cranking gas into it as fast as they can

EXT VENETIAN CASINO - PONTE DEI SOSPIRI - CONTINUOUS

A distance from the Valet Alice and Carlos stand perched on the
Ponte dei Sospiri binoculars in hand Carlos scans the Strip
Alice takes the sky

ALICE (0S)

Still no movement Were good

EXT THE VENETIAN CASINO - VALET - CONTINUOUS
Valentine checks the level of the gas in the tanker

VALENTINE

Well be done in five

Out of habit Valentine checks a cigarette machine by the Valet
Empty

VALENTINE (CONTD)
Damn

CLOSE ON LJ -- standing at a distance watching the activity
Unseen by the others he slips away into the shadows of the
Venetian

INT VENETIAN DAY

The interior is barely recognizable Sand dunes everywhere
The occasional roulette wheel or slot machine rising to the
surface Its also very dark and very scary in here

LJ moves with a purpose keeping to the side walls headed for

An overturned CRAPS table LJ holsters his 45 and kneels
beside the table Theres something trapped under it that he
wants to get to

As LJ reaches however a DARK SHADOW rises up behind him
Ld is totally distracted as the shadow envelops him

LJ
(shocked)
DAMN

LJ is scared half to death The dark shadow is revealed to be
Betty

LJ (CONTD)
Dont sneak up on a man like that

BETTY
What are you doing

LJ produces three chips that he acquired from under the craps
table Each is for a 1000

LJ
Taking my two g back with
interest
BETTY
(incredulous)
What good are they

LJ stares at her like she were the dumbest woman to walk the
Earth

LJ
Its the principle of the thing

He shakes his head at her lack of moral fibre

LJ (CONTD)
A man gotta have his principles

EXT VENETIAN CASINO - PONTE DEI SOSPIRI DAY

Carlos and Alice on watch They are at a distance from the
group Isolated Vulnerable

CLOSE ON -- Paco Sitting at Alices side He sniffs the air -
sensing something His hackles raise

After a moment Alice catches a feint noise bouncing off the
deserted buildings -- the clatter of rotor blades

ALICE
You hear that

Carlos shakes his head
After a moment there is an INHUMAN SCREAM which echoes around
the buildings Impossible to tell the direction from which it
came But its close
CARLOS
(worried)
I heard that
The very echo of the scream sends a chill through them Alice
and Carlos share a look A sudden noise over the walkie makes
them jump --
VALENTINE (0S)
(over the walkie)
Were done get down here
EXT THE STRIP DAY
The convoy is back on the move Headed out of town
INT FLAT BED
Carlos is at the wheel Alice stares up at the deserted
buildings suspiciously K-Mart sees the way Alices hand runs
unconsciously over the breech of the 12 gauge
Theres trouble coming
EXT STORM DRAIN
CRANE UP out of a concrete storm drain - built to handle the
winter flash floods The Strip should pass over it but all
four lanes are a mess of collapsed concrete and twisted rebar
Its impassable
The convoy grinds to a halt
Alice and the other climb from their vehicles
VALENTINE
We cant go back the way we came
Well go around
Valentine indicates a side street that seems clear
ALICE

(immediately suspicious)
Theres something wrong here

VALENTINE
(shrugs)
The roads fucked up Complain to the
mayor

Carlos tries to re-assure Alice

CARLOS
Im sure a lot of shit went down here
when the city was over-run

ALICE
No This was recent Look

Alice points to a nearby chunk of concrete The twisted ends of
the metal rebar catch the light

ALICE (CONTD)
the metal hasnt had time to
oxidize

Alice and Carlos exchange a look That Inhuman Scream still
fresh in their minds

VALENTINE
Lets just get moving I want out of
this place

No one is going to argue with that sentiment But as the convoy
heads down the empty side street they cant shake the suspicion
that theyre being shepherded in some way

HIGH ANGLE SHOT --

Looking down on the convoy as it snakes through the abandoned
city The high angle adds to the air of tension Suggesting
that they are being watched by someonesomething

EXT SIDE STREET
The street runs down the side of the Venetian

The convoy comes to a sudden halt Sitting directly in their
path blocking the road is a large metal freight container
Its painted black and bears the Umbrella Logo And unlike
anything else in this distressed and decayed city the container
looks brand new If youre sharp youll remember it from
Isaacs helicopter earlier

INT HUMMER - CONTINUOUS

VALENTINE
What the fuck

Alice marches past the Hummer headed for the container

ALICE
We have to move it

EXT NEWS TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The front of Mikeys truck is fitted with a winch Valentine
pulls the metal towing hook free and begins to unspool the
cable

Alice already has a similar hook and cable from the front of the

Flat Bed

In the background LJ and Betty are doing the same with the
Ambulance This freight container is big and its going to
need the power of all three vehicles to move it

EXT SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

As they cautiously approach the container Alice looks around
but there is no sign of life anywhere

Valentine puts her ear to the container No sound from within
But this is very VERY creepy

Valentine inspects the front of the container

VALENTINE
No lock No way to open it

LJ
Good
(edgy and impatient)
Now lets get this done

INT FLAT BED - CAB CONTINUOUS

K-Mart checks behind them No sign of movement on the street
But theres a growing sense of tension

EXT SIDE STREET DAY
CLOSE ON -- the towing hooks as they are fixed in place on the
container Alice gives K-Mart the thumbs up Valentine does

the same to Mikey in the News Truck and Betty to LJ in the
Ambulance

The cables go taut and for a moment nothing happens Perhaps
the container is too heavy Then suddenly it shifts lurching
violently to one side The cables take up the strain once more
and the container moves another few feet

CLOSE ON -- the winch at the front of the Flat Bed It is
smoking with the strain Carlos checking the winches sees it
and signals to K-Mart

CARLOS
Ease off Ease it off

K-Mart does as shes told and Carlos kneels down to inspect the
winch The other two cables take up the strain but suddenly
one of them begins to fray with the extra load

ALICE
Down

She pushes Betty and Valentine down as the cable SNAPS and whips
over their heads at high speed A deadly metal scythe that
would slice through anything in its way Alices warning has
saved their lives

ALICE (CONTD)
Stop Stop

LJ and Mikey stop their winches The cable to the News Truck
is the one that snapped

Valentine dusts herself down

VALENTINE
Thank you

ALICE
Dont mention it

They talk like Alice just held open a door for her Cool

CLOSE ON -- the towing hook from the News Truck The cable has
sheered clean off As Alice kneels to examine it she hears a
feint noise Coming from WITHIN the container

She places her ear against the metal Nothing Or was that
movement Alice strains to hear when suddenly --

BANG One of the bolts holding the front of the container in
place blows CLEAN OFF Alice jumps back in surprise as more
and more of the bolts begin to blow These are EXPLOSIVE BOLTS
Designed for the rapid deployment of whatever is inside

ALICE (CONTD)
Get back

The whole front of the container falls to the ground narrowly
missing Alice Betty and Valentine The women pull their guns
ready for action but nothing happens

The interior of the container is filled with an inky
impenetrable darkness

THE CAMERA TRACKS into the depths of the container There is
the hint of movement OF SOMETHING ALIVE IN THERE

A delicious moment of anticipation Alices finger tenses on
the trigger

Then suddenly all hell breaks loose RUNNING from the darkness
at top speed are three dozen Undead The women are caught off
guard for a moment and dont even fire Theyve never seen
Undead move like this

These are all of Isaacs failed experiments Each with the
distinctive triangular puncture mark at the base of their necks
And each one filled with an uncontrollable rage as well as an
unnatural speed and strength The Raiders Undead is amongst
them

We hear the same chilling INHUMAN SCREAM that Alice and Carlos
had heard earlier

As the first of the Undead LEAPS at Alice she blows it out of
the air with both barrels of her sawn-off The Undead hits the
ground rolls and then gets back to its feet Its chest in
tatters but its speed and hunger intact

Betty and Valentine slow the first few Undead with a barrage of
gunfire but in an instant they need to reload and the Undead
are so fast they are never going to get the chance to do it

ALICE (CONTD)
Run

Alice stops the lead Undead in his tracks with a clothesline -
a classic aikido move which uses the Undeads own speed and
strength against it The Undead falls to the ground and never
gets up His neck broken At least these things can be killed

Alice has given Valentine and Betty a split second for escape
and they take it racing back to their vehicles

Valentine heads to the Flat Bed to protect K-Mart But its
just too far The lightning fast Undead will overtake her

As one of the Undead leaps for her we see that Valentine is

defenseless Suddenly the Undead is cut down by a fusillade of
gun fire

Carlos twin 45s in hand is laying down a suppressing fire
INT FLAT BED - CAB - CONTINUOUS

Valentine slams the door closed behind her just as two Undead
IMPACT with the cab They hit so hard they leave dents in the
bodywork Their hands PUNCH at the windows desperate to be in
Valentine yells to K-Mart

VALENTINE
Get in the back

EXT FLAT BED -— CONTINUOUS
Carlos still kneels by the winch at the front of the Flat Bed
He has saved Valentine but now both 45s click empty And hes
being charged by a pack of Undead with no time to reload
Carlos tucks and rolls disappearing UNDER the truck
UNDERNEATH THE FLAT BED --
Its dark and claustrophobic Carlos backpedals as he STRUGGLES
to reload Two Undead have pursued him under there Their
clawing fingers just inches from his boots
EXT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS
Betty has almost made it to the Ambulance when an Undead TACKLES
her sending her sprawling to the ground The Undead is on top
of her immediately rearing up ready to take a bite when
BAM It is hit in the head by the Ambulance door opening
The door hits with such force it staves in the Undeads skull

Even in the midst of such chaos LJ is still the ladies man
EXT UNDERNEATH THE FLAT BED - CONTINUOUS
Carlos is in trouble Trapped in a nightmarish tight space
with two Undead clawing their way up his legs their mouths just

inches from his flesh One rears up and prepares to take a bite
out of his calf when --

BOOM Carlos fires having successfully reloaded The sound
of the gunshot is deafening in such a confined space The first
Undead falls back unmoving Carlos fires again and the second
Undead joins it

Carlos breathes a sigh of relief and turns away - COMING FACE TO
FACE WITH A THIRD UNDEAD ITS SNARLING FACE JUST INCHES FROM
HIS OWN

CLOSE ON ALICES EYES - as her look suddenly becomes distant
distracted As if her mind were elsewhere

And in the darkness of her pupils in the depths far behind her

the bare hint of something back there --

And Alice FREEZES The Kukris hanging loosely from her hands

In the midst of the chaos the News Truck backs up attempting
to get away from the Undead In his haste Mikey demolishes
fake Venetian statues and crashes into a canal filled with sand
The back wheels sinking instantly Mikey shifts gears and pumps
the gas pedal

MIKEY
Come on Come on

But the back wheels just dig themselves deeper into the sand

Undead SLAM against the window Mikey jumps in terror The
Undead are all around the News Truck Hands and feet beating
against the vehicle CRACKING what should be bullet proof

tools trying to pry open the doors These things are
intelligent and theyre strong And they want in

back of the truck

Valentine jumps back The Undead climbs into the cab
Valentine brings up her pistol and FIRES

CLOSE ON MIKEY --

as he sees Valentine push the Undead from the truck Mikey
races towards her There is a whole army of Undead in pursuit

He has almost made it but at the last second an Undead leaps
from behind a half buried Gondola and knocks Mikey off his feet

Valentine shoots it immediately but Mikey has lost too much
time A wave of Undead breaks upon him and in an instant he is
hidden from view

VALENTINES POV --

She never sees Mikey again just the Undead -- tearing at scraps
of clothing morsels of flesh their fingers and mouths stained
with blood These creatures have a savagery weve never
witnessed before

Valentine watches distraught and powerless Undead charge the
truck and Valentine is forced to close the door Undead SLAM
against the Flat Bed smearing the glass with their newly bloody
handprints

A body SLAMMING against the opposite side of the cab jolts

Valentine out of it Its Carlos Valentine quickly unlocks
the door throwing it open

VALENTINE (CONTD)
Thank God you made it

But Carlos just lunges at her His eyes inhuman His flesh
deathly pale HE HAS TURNED

Carlos sinks his teeth into Valentines shoulder K-Mart
SCREAMS as Valentine struggles into the back of the cab
desperate to get away from her old friend

Carlos lunges for K-Mart his teeth already stained with

raises her gun

LJ Get in the cockpit

Ld
I can see it from here Suckers full
of bullet holes Its flying days are

done

ALICE
I know But look at the
instrumentation

LJ grumbles but does as hes told

LJ
Okay

ALICE
I want to know what its last bearing
was

LJ
Why

ALICE
Because then we know where it came
from

EXT SIDE STREET DAY

Alice LJ and K-Mart return to the convoy Betty is bandaging
Valentine The wound is very deep

ALICE
They have the anti-virus I saw
it

She puts a reassuring hand on Valentine

ALICE (CONTD)
Youll be okay

Alice surveys the abandoned streets The sun is sinking behind
the buildings Long menacing shadows reaching for them like
dark fingers

ALICE (CONTD)
We should get moving

Alice senses something wrong Something hanging in the air
Something no one wants to say

ALICE (CONTD)
Wheres Carlos

CUT TO
EXT DESERT - SUNSET
The convoy has parked up at the outskirts of Las Vegas
Silhouetted against a blood red sky a single cross marks
Carlos grave The others turn and walk back to their vehicles
but Alice remains Impassive Staring at the cross
Someone has hung Carlos dog tags over the rough wooden cross
As the others climb back into their vehicles and Alice is
finally alone emotion comes flooding across her face Tears
roll down her cheeks as she reaches down and takes the dog tags
from the cross

In the midst of all the horror this was the man she was closest
to And now hes gone

The tears are almost uncontrollable The repressed emotion from
years of leadership years of strength finally given vent

EXT CONVOY - SUNSET - LATER
The sun has just dipped beyond the horizon as Alice walks back
to the vehicles The tears are gone She wears the dog tags
around her neck Framed against the bloody sky she has the
look of some avenging fallen angel
K-MART
(concerned)
Alice
But Alice just walks past her

ALICE
Lets go

The warrior has returned
Pity her prey
CUT TO
INT THE COMPLEX - CORRIDOR NIGHT
Two ARMED GUARDS stand outside the door to Isaacs lab They

salute as Doctor Slater approaches He has clearly assumed
command Everything he always wanted

SLATER
How is he

GUARD
Under house arrest as you instructed
Hes been quiet

INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY

The door swings open and Slater enters The two Guards are with
him Isaacs sits with his back to them He is injecting
himself with anti-virus The table beside him is littered with
empty vials

SLATER
(shocked)
How much of this have you used

DOCTOR ISAACS
Her blood increased the creatures
powers But also increased the
strength of the infection

He finishes injecting himself Discards the empty vial of anti-
virus

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)

I needed it
SLATER
You have no idea what this will do to
you
DOCTOR ISAACS
Oh

For the first time Isaacs turns to face Slater Theres
something about him Something changed

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
I have an idea

SLATER
Youre out of control

Isaacs doesnt offer a reply

SLATER (CONTD)
Well this ends here

Slater takes out his sidearm Hes been waiting a long time for
this

SLATER (CONTD)
Under executive order 1345 issued by
Commander Okamoto for insubordination
and gross misconduct in the field
I sentence you to summary liquidation

DOCTOR ISAACS
(ironic)
Liquidation

SLATER
Just die

Slater shoots Isaacs once in the heart Isaacs looks up at him
in disbelief

DOCTOR ISAACS
(surprised)
But

But he cant get the words out Cant take another breath
Blood spills from the heart wound

SLATER
You always were an arrogant son of a
bitch

Slater shoots him twice more And Isaacs dies His eyes glaze
over and shut for the last time Slater turns to the Guards

SLATER (CONTD)
Take the body to the surface and
dispose of it Then bring up all the
Stats on Programme Alice I want to
see what harm hes done

But the Guards arent listening They are staring over Slaters
shoulder in shock for Doctor Isaacs has just risen to his feet
Slater turns in surprise

DOCTOR ISAACS
Dont look so shocked

Isaacs complexion is deathly pale Beneath his shirt around
the heart wound something moves Something inhuman

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
Theres nothing harder to kill

Isaacs extends his right arm and it SPLITS OPEN The fingers

peeling back like fleshy petals to reveal a mass of scaly
tentacles beneath the skin

Tentacles that SHOOT OUT penetrating Slaters eye sockets and
burrowing under his flesh They even fill his mouth as he tries
to scream

DOCTOR ISAACS (CONTD)
-- than something thats already
dead
One Guard reaches for his gun and the other runs for the door
We get the feeling neither of them are going to make it

CUT TO
EXT RIDGE DAWN
Alice and Valentine lie just below the crest of a desert ridge
Reflected in Alices binoculars we see the Weather Station - the
secret entrance to The Complex As usual the perimeter fence
is ringed with thousands of Undead If anything their numbers
have grown since the last time

Just as Alice had hoped the second Umbrella Helicopter is
peaking from beneath camouflage netting

ANGLE ON --
LJ and Betty On the same ridge Looking at the same chopper

LJ
You think you can fly one of those

BETTY
I used to be an airborne paramedic
Not a pilot

LJ just stares at her After a beat --
BETTY (CONTD)
(flustered)
I know the theory

LJ
Well youre about to get the practise

ANGLE ON --

Valentine as she is seized by a terrible coughing fit Shes
lost a lot of blood Looks like hell

ALICE
(comforting)
Hold on They have the anti-virus
down there

Valentine shakes her head

VALENTINE
Too late And you know it
Infections gone too far

She lowers her hand from her mouth Its covered in blood The
bite from Carlos was deep and shes already in the late stages
of infection

VALENTINE (CONTD)
And
(neds to the weather station)
--- you need someone to get you in
there

Alice knows Jill is right Shes beyond help But Alice cant
bear to lose another friend

VALENTINE (CONTD)
(bloody smile)

Besides I have a plan
ALICE

Really
VALENTINE

Oh yeah and its a beauty
CUT TO
EXT CONVOY DAY

K-MART
Jill you cant

K-Mart is on the verge of tears

VALENTINE
I have to

Valentine winces in pain In the last stages of infection
VALENTINE (CONTD)
I cant do much more for you But
I can do this
As she leans against the cab of the Tanker the others gather

around A dozen people in all - the remnants of her convoy -
including the six children She turns to address them

VALENTINE (CONTD)
When you get down there you make for
the helicopter B will fly She and
LJ are in charge now Alice is
right we cant be the only ones
left There are other like us out
there somewhere You make it to
Alaska To safety

K-Mart nods Understanding but not liking it Some of the
children are crying

Led
See you around Valentine

Valentine hugs LJ then K-Mart As she climbs into the cab of
the tanker Alice stops her

ALICE
Found these
She hands Jill a packet of smokes - American Spirits Herbal
cigarettes
VALENTINE

Thanks but they dont count

ALICE
Jill I know we

Valentine shakes her head

VALENTINE
Save it

These two have been through so much together

VALENTINE (CONTD)
Just promise me one thing
(beat)
When you get in there You make them

pay
The two women share a look

ALICE
Consider it done

SMASH CUT TO

EXT TANKER DAY

The Canola Oil Tanker races across the desert flats at top
speed Headed for the weather station The Hummer pulls level
Alice and K-Mart ride within The rest of the convoy follows
behind

Alice salutes Valentine

INT TANKER - CAB - CONTINUOUS

Valentine acknowledges the salute For a moment there is a long
look between the two and then the Hummer drops back We know
that this is the last time the two women will see one another

Valentine looks over to the passenger seat A short fuse runs
between her and a HUGE pack of EXPLOSIVES

VALENTINE
(to herself)
Wish I had a smoke

EXT WEATHER STATION - PERIMETER - CONTINUOUS
The Undead at the edge of the fence begin to turn towards the
vehicles The Tanker is in the lead The Hummer and the rest
of the convoy trailing at a good distance
EXT TANKER - CONTINUOUS
The Tanker impacts with the ranks of the Undead plowing through
them but slowing considerably There is a whole army of
Undead and sheer weight of numbers is bringing the Tanker to a
halt
INT TANKER - CAB - CONTINUOUS
Valentine fights to retain control of the wheel
EXT TANKER - CONTINUOUS
Suddenly the front wheels of the Tanker hit a ditch Theres no
way that Valentine could have seen it through the mass of
Undead The whole Tanker JACKKNIFES and rolls over onto its
side
INT TANKER - CAB - CONTINUOUS

Valentine is flung around the cab like a rag doll

EXT TANKER - CONTINUOUS

The Tanker slides to a halt and within an instant it is swarmed
with the Undead

ARIEL SHOT --

Showing the Tanker surrounded by thousands of Undead All
desperate for the fresh meat within

INT TANKER CAB - CONTINUOUS

The cab is a mess Valentine slowly recovers from the crash
She is hanging at a weird angle from her seat belt As her
blurred vision clears she sees --

A PACK OF CIGARETTES

They are tucked behind the sun visor Had been there all the
time

VALENTINE
(forces a laugh)
Ill be damned

As the Undead force their way into the Cab Valentine places a
cigarette between her lips At last

She takes a lighter from her pocket It flares into life But
the Undead are IN the Cab now Snarling teeth and clawing
fingers

VALENTINE (CONTD)
Oh hell

SLOW MOTION --

As Valentine lights the fuse instead of the cigarette

As it burns Valentine brings the lighter back to her cigarette
CLOSE ON -- the Undead as they reach for her

CLOSE ON -- the tip of the cigarette Valentine draws on it
The tip igniting

WIDE SHOT -- of the truck as it EXPLODES
ARIEL SHOT --

As the blast wave spreads out vaporizing a thousand Undead

INT HUMMER - CONTINUOUS
The windshield is sprayed with debris and burning fuel

ALICE
Hold on

EXT WEATHER STATION — CONTINUOUS
The Hummer races at top speed through the burning wasteland that
Valentine has created She has punched a huge hole in the ranks

of the Undead The Hummer leads the rest of the convoy through
it
INT HUMMER - CONTINUOUS
As the Hummer breaks through the tatters of the perimeter fence
K-Mart stares out of the window Shes focussed on the remnants
of the Tanker Valentine is gone forever

CUT TO
EXT WEATHER STATION - MOMENTS LATER
The Convoy has stopped beside the helicopter Half the adults
pull the camouflage netting free while the rest help the
children onboard
INT HELICOPTER - COCKPIT

Betty sits at the controls Theres so many of them Overhead
the rotor blades fire into life and begin to revolve

LJ
Thats it girl
(leans over her shoulder)
Knew you could do it

BETTY
(worried)
That was the easy bit
EXT PERIMETER FENCE - CONTINUOUS

The Undead pour through the gaping hole in the fence Headed
for the helicopter and the weather station

EXT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
Everyone is onboard except Alice She stands OUTSIDE the

helicopter caught in the downdraft She hands the Red Journal
to K-Mart

ALICE
Here

K-MART
Youre not coming

Alice shakes her head She glances at the Undead - theyre
getting close - then nods to Betty 4n the cockpit

INT HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Betty nervously pulls back on the controls

BETTY
Okay here we go

EXT WEATHER STATION - CONTINUOUS
Alice watches as the helicopter rises ten feet in the air then
LURCHES to one side almost demolishing the roof of the weather
station
Gradually Betty brings it back under control
INT HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
BETTY
(intense concentration)
Easy Easy

Slowly but surely the helicopter rises into the air Theyre
going to be alright

INT HELICOPTER - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS

K-Mart watches through the open door as Alice slowly recedes
into the distance A lone woman with only a small dog for
company

She cuts a mythic figure

EXT WEATHER STATION - MOMENTS LATER

The downdraft dies as the helicopter disappears Alice and Paco
are left alone Just as we found them

In the distance there are a thousand Undead headed their way
Suddenly there is movement RIGHT BEHIND ALICE

She spins gun in hand to see --

LJ
Touchy

Alice lowers her gun

ALICE
What are you doing here

LJ shrugs

LJ
I hate to fly

CUT TO
INT UNDERGROUND - CONCRETE SHAFT - MINUTES LATER

Alice Paco and LJ drop down the shaft from the Weather
Station They are riding on the Hydraulic Platform Numbers
painted on the concrete walls let them know that they are 200
feet underground

INT CAVE

The platform comes to rest in the natural rock cave As before
the place is littered with vehicles and high-tech equipment
Only now there is no sign of life

Alice and LJ cautiously walk the concrete road leading to the
large set of Blast Doors The entrance to The Complex is open
and unguarded Alice and LJ share a look then draw their
guns

INT THE COMPLEX - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

They enter the giant underground facility Still there is no
sign of life Its eerie

A large glass sculpture hangs from one wall It is made up of
hundreds of interlocking mirrored cubes Alice stares at her
fractured reflection It cant help but echo her experience in
RESIDENT EVIL 1

ALICE
(unsettled)
Stay tight
INT THE COMPLEX - CORRIDOR - JUNCTION

Up ahead the corridor splits in two Both choices are
identical except --

LJ
There

The left hand corridor has a trail of blood splashed along the
floor Like a body was dragged

As they draw closer there are multiple bloody handprints on the
walls Evidence of a fight

LJ (CONTD)
What happened here

INT THE COMPLEX - BRIEFING ROOM

Alice enters the darkened room The light fittings are smashed
There are bullet holes in the walls Blood everywhere but no
bodies

One of the light fittings is still swinging giving the shadows
a menacing life of their own LJ follows Alice into the room
The eeriness of the place getting to him Even Paco is
restless

Alice nudges LJ scaring the life out of him

LJ
What

She points up There are holes in the ceiling exposing
ventilation shafts There are bloody marks all over them as if
someone or something had dragged the bodies UP into the shafts

SUDDENLY there is MOVEMENT behind them Taking both LJ and
Alice by surprise LJ turns firing on instinct

But the bullet goes STRAIGHT THROUGH his target

It is a HOLOGRAM of the White Queen that has suddenly appeared
floating over the long table

WHITE QUEEN
Im sorry I didnt mean to startle
you

As before the White Queen has the appearance voice and speech
patterns of a small child But her words are those of a
powerful Artificial Intelligence

LJ
What the fuck are you

LJ turns

ALICE
The White Queen The computer that
runs this place Shes AI
modelled after the head programmers
daughter

to Alice How does she know all this

ALICE (CONTD)
I met the sister
(beat)
She was a homicidal bitch

WHITE QUEEN
My sister computer was merely
following the most logical path for
the preservation of human life

ALICE
Kill a few save a lot

WHITE QUEEN
Put simply that was her goal

ALICE
Didnt quite work out did it

WHITE QUEEN
We cannot control the vagaries of
human behavior

LJ
What happened down here

WHITE QUEEN

Doctor Isaacs returned in an infected
State He was bitten by a creature
that had been treated with a newly
developed serum

(nods to Alice)
A serum derived from your blood The
resulting infection has caused massive
mutation

ALICE
My blood

WHITE QUEEN
Your blood has bonded with the T-
virus Doctor Isaacs correctly
deduced that it could be used to
reverse the process of infection
(MORE)

Alice shrugs

WHITE QUEEN (CONTD)
To cure or destroy the bichazard for
good

LJ
Her blood is the cure for all this

WHITE QUEEN
Correct

LJ
(to Alice)
Arent you special

ALICE
Why are you talking to us

WHITE QUEEN
Like my sister I was programmed to
preserve human life My satellites
show that there are 1733548 human
survivors still alive on the surface
of the Earth Your blood is pure and
this facility contains all the
laboratory equipment you will require
to synthesize a cure

ALICE
(not quite believing it)
This could all end

WHITE QUEEN
Correct

LJ
Goddamn

WHITE QUEEN
There is however

She chooses her next words carefully

WHITE QUEEN (CONTD)
a small problem

CUT TO
INT THE COMPLEX - CORRIDOR
Alice and LJd stand at a thick steel blast door which seals the

corridor LEVEL 7 is stencilled on it The White Queen
appears on a FLAT SCREEN computer console by the door

WHITE QUEEN
I have him contained on the lower

levels but this is where the
laboratories are located

LJ
Great

WHITE QUEEN
Once you cross the threshold I cannot
help you He altered my protocols
locking me out from this level

ALICE
(to Paco
You stay here

The little dog doesnt look happy but he does as hes told

LJ
(hopeful)
What about me

Alice just smiles at him
INT THE COMPLEX LEVEL 7

We see Alice and LJ outlined in the doorway as the blast door
slides up Its pitch black in here

As they step over the threshold --

WHITE QUEEN
Alice
(beat)
Good luck

Alice nods and steps into the darkness LJ follows behind

LJ
(to Alice)
I dont get good luck
(then to himself)
Shit I don’t need good luck
(warming to his theme)
Too damn good to need luck

INT THE COMPLEX LEVEL 7 - CORRIDORS
Alice and LJ make their way through a pitch black labyrinth

Whatever Isaacs has mutated into clearly it doesnt need
lights

Both Alice and LJ carry flashlights but they do little to
allay the growing sense of dread SUDDENLY SOMETHING MOVES
between the Camera and the two humans A big black SILHOUETTE
it scares the hell out of us

LJ swings his flashlight around but whatever it is has gone
Its fast as well as big

INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY

The two enter the darkness of the lab More than ever this
place resembles a medieval torture chamber The light fixtures
are smashed but there is still power to the computer terminals
They provide a low blue glow that washes over the pile of dead
bodies arranged neatly in the centre of the room

ALICE
Someones been busy

The bodies are ordered in a precise symmetrical pattern like a
pyramid built from the dead There is a strange twisted

intelligence at work here

LJ
Look at this

LJ seats himself at one of the terminals

LJ (CONTD)
Were already in the mainframe

He begins to tap at the computer keys
LJd (CONTD)
(surprised)
Shit
The keypad is covered in sticky bloody fingerprints

ALICE
Can you pull up the security system

LJ
Done

A series of CCTV shots come up They can monitor the
interior of The Complex from right here

LJ (CONTD)

And look at this These motherfuckers
even got files on us

He pulls up the security files we saw at the start of the movie
They detail Alice Valentine Carlos K-Mart etc Each file
lists their potential THREAT LEVEL to Umbrella

LJ (CONTD)
Like were Americas Most Wanted

LJ proudly pulls up his own file He is instantly horrified

to see his Threat Level -- It is MINIMALZERO
LJ (CONTD)
(outraged)
MinimalZero MINIMALZERO What is
this shit Ima badass
motherfucker I aint no
minimalzero

But Alice isnt listening

ALICE
There

She has seen something moving on one of the CCTV Cameras
Something in the depths of the lab Amongst the darkened cryo-
stasis tanks

ALICE (CONTD)
I see him

As Alice moves off she slips an earpiece into her left ear

ALICE (CONTD)
Stay here Guide me in

Ld
Right

Alice is swallowed by the darkness LJ looks around Now
that he is alone the lab becomes even more unsettling LJ
glances at the pile of dead bodies directly behind him

LJ (CONTD)
Right

INT CRYO-STASIS TANKS
Alice moves through the labyrinth of glass She looks up at the
tanks that surround her At the dark figures inside Their

blond hair hanging suspended in the fluid She is moving
through a hundred living breathing replicas of herself

ALICE
(quietly to herself)
Well This is fairly strange

INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

LJ
What was that

ALICE (O0S)
Nothing

INT CRYO-STASIS TANKS - CONTINUOUS
Alice advances Alert

Suddenly there is movement Refracted through the fluid in the
tanks

ALICE

Ld (0S)
Hes up ahead On your left No wait

But its hard to tell through the confusion of glass and shadows
where exactly the movement originates

LJ (0S) (CONTD)
No No Your right

ALICE
Which is it

LJ (0S)
The right

Suddenly there is movement BEHIND her Alice turns weapon at
the ready But theres nothing there We are starting to get
the feeling that perhaps Alice is no longer the hunter

That something is stalking her

ALICE
Ld

LJ (0S)
T cant tell I think

Without warning Isaacs is upon her He moves with inhuman
speed Strikes with unnatural strength

Alices gun goes flying

We glimpse Isaacs in the half light His mouth and teeth
stained with the blood of his victims He is naked from the
waist up His body impossibly muscular The kind of definition
only a crazed body builder on a suicidal diet of steroids could
achieve

He has mutated into what the video game describes as a TYRANT

The IsaacsTyrant charges but this time Alice is ready She
cant match his strength but she has the edge on speed She
ducks his blow and in a classic jujitsu move DISLOCATES his
entire arm

But the popping of bone and musculature doesnt slow the
IsaacsTyrant one bit He flings Alice off and she CRASHES
into one of the tanks the glass shattering around her

Alice comes up bleeding to see the IsaacsTyrant charging
again

Her hand gropes for a shard of BROKEN GLASS from the cryo-stasis
tank She FLINGS the two foot piece of glass like it were a
knife

PAN with the gleaming shard of glass as it arcs through the air
like one of Alices Kukris

It SLICES through the IsaacsTyrants shoulder cutting clean
through bone and muscle Opening up an artery in the process

But before Alice can press her advantage the water pressure in
the damaged tank causes the rest of the glass to give way The
body inside falls towards Alice

Acting on instinct Alice catches the body and eases it to the
ground Alice is holding a naked CLONE of herself in her arms
The Clone freed so abruptly from Cryo-Stasis is gasping for
air Her body convulsing Like a fish out of water Desperate
to breathe but not knowing how

By the time Alice looks up at her foe the IsaacsTyrant is
nowhere to be seen

INT THE COMPLEX CORRIDOR
In the darkness of the corridor we glimpse the IsaacsTyrant
He is covered in a sheen of his own blood but already the

artery itself has stopped bleeding The wound seems to be
healing of its own accord

114

He takes a hold of his dislocated arm and savagely pops it back
into place Its the kind of thing that Alice could do in
RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE but the IsaacsTyrant seems to feel
none of the accompanying pain If anything it almost seems
pleasurable for him

INT CRYO-STASIS TANKS

Alice still holds the mirror image of herself in her arms

The Clone convulses massively and her eyelids open She looks
straight into the face of Alice For a moment there is a
flicker of recognition And then her body gives out

The Clone dies in Alices arms

For a moment Alice cradles her own naked self Her skin slick
with the fluid from the tank And then she slowly eases the
dead body to the ground

When she looks up Alices eyes are filled with a murderous
rage

INT THE COMPLEX - CORRIDOR

Alice enters the corridor where we had glimpsed the
IsaacsTyrant just moments earlier The creature is nowhere to
be seen but the walls are slick with its blood

Up ahead the outline of a door

Alice pushes it open and steps into --

INT MANSION - BATHROOM

Tiled floor bathroom fittings made of brass The shower is
running and the washbasin mirror is fogged with condensation
Alice looks around in surprise This is an exact replica of the
opening of RESIDENT EVIL 1

For Alice it is like she has stepped back in time

INT MANSION - BEDROOM

Alice sees a red dress laid on the bed A pair of boots stand
close by Precisely as she remembered it This is all an exact
replica of her own experiences Built as part of the “training
floor for the Clones

CLOSE ON -- an antique writing desk Lying on it is a
handwritten note Alice picks it up

Today All Your Dreams Come True

CUT TO
INT MANSION HALLWAY
Alice prowls the mansion Hunting for Isaacs

CLOSE ON a framed photograph as Alice takes it from a side
table Its of her and the man who posed as her husband in
RESIDENT EVIL 1 Suddenly there is movement behind Alice -
reflected in the mirrored frame of the photograph

Alice dodges as the IsaacsTyrant lunges at her His FIST goes
straight through the side table SMASHING it to kindling

He strikes again but Alice dodges a Kukri in her hand She
SLICES deep into the IsaacsTyrants chest A long deep wound
opens up but there is little blood Beneath his skin
something moves Something inhuman And before Alices eyes
the WOUND BEGINS TO HEAL UP

Alice presses home her attack but every slice she makes seems
to just enrage the Tyrant more and even worse begins to heal
up moments later

The IsaacsTyrant BACKHANDS Alice sending her flying through the
air She lands close to the front door of the mansion

CLOSE ON THE KUKRI - as it tumbles from Alices hand and embeds
itself point first in the wooden floorboards

CLOSE ON THE ISAACSTYRANT -- as he extends his right arm and it
SPLITS OPEN The fingers peeling back like fleshy petals to
reveal a mass of scaly tentacles beneath the skin Tentacles
that SHOOT OUT toward Alice

Alice tries to dodge but in an instant they wrap themselves
around her neck

Alices fingertips reach for the Kukri Grazing the handle but
unable to get a grip

The Tyrant tightens its grip It is literally STRANGLING the
life out of her

Alices fingers reach for the Kukri but it is hopeless
She is on the verge of passing out

When suddenly Alice changes tactics Kicking DOWN against the
floorboards with tremendous force

Like a see-saw as one end of the floorboard goes down the
other (holding the Kukri) goes up -- and the Kukri is flung into
the air

Alice grabs it and SLICES clean through one of the tentacles

The IsaacsTyrant bellows in pain and retracts the other
tentacles In an instant Alice is free But now she watches in
horror as like a Hydra of myth the severed tentacle sub-
divides and becomes TWO MORE IsaacsTyrant stares at them and
smiles

ISAACSTYRANT
Now I have an idea what it feels like
«e to be you The power

ALICE

You have no idea
CLOSE ON the tentacles as they launch another attack on Alice

CLOSE ON Alice as she turns her attention INWARDS We have seen
this once before - when she used her psychic powers to warp and
control the flames at the Truck Stop

The tentacles have almost reached Alice when suddenly THEY
FREEZE IN MID-AIR Something is holding them in place

Then Alice unleashes an immense PSYCHIC BLAST

It rips up the floorboards between herself and the Tyrant And
when it hits the IsaacsTyrant it lifts him off the ground and
slams him into the mansion wall The impact is so great that
the Tyrant is embedded in the brickwork

CLOSE ON ALICE - As before the use of such power exhausts her
She falls to her knees Blood runs from her right nostril

For a moment there is silence It seems as though the fight is
over

But then the IsaacsTyrant pulls himself from the wall Plaster
and masonry dropping all around him He should be dead but
instead he just laughs There is something inhumaninsane about
the sound The mutation is warping his intelligence making him
less human by the moment

Alice gets back to her feet She turns her attention inwards
again but before she has a chance --

The IsaacsTyrant unleashes a psychic blast of his own And
this one is twice the strength of Alices

»

Alice is picked off her feet and flung backwards with INCREDIBLE
FORCE She blasts through the mansion door ripping it off its
hinges and is thrown into --

INT THE HIVE - GLASS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

The familiar long corridor made entirely of glass The place
where ONE (the leader of the Commando team) and the other
Commandoes met their bloody end in RESIDENT EVIL 1

And now Alice lies bleeding on the mirrored floor

The impact of crashing through the door should have splintered
her bones liquefied her internal organs But somehow she still
breathes Just

The IsaacsTyrant steps into the glass corridor He looks down
on the shattered frame of Alice with contempt She seems to be
muttering softly to herself Her mind broken as well as her
body

ISAACSTYRANT
For so long I thought you were the
future How wrong I was

Alice sees the mutation rippling beneath the surface of his
skin The Tyrants muscles literally growing and bulging
Become less human before her eyes

ISAACSTYRANT (CONTD)
I am the future

With superhuman effort Alice forces herself to her feet She
can barely stand But still she launches a blow against the
Tyrant The IsaacsTyrant catches it easily Crushing her
fingers then sending her crashing backwards with a sledgehammer
blow to her solar-plexus

Alice slides to a halt at the far end of the corridor
Defeated

The IsaacsTyrant advances on her Alice can barely raise her
head She is helpless The IsaacsTyrant towers above her He
raises his fist to deliver the killer blow

ALICE
LJ

CLOSE ON Alices walkie We realize that it is still switched
on This is why she seemed to be muttering to herself earlier

CLOSE ON Alice as she makes bloody eye contact with the
IsaacsTyrant

ALICE (CONTD)
now

The IsaacsTyrant turns in surprise as a horizontal beam of
laser light shoots down the corridor at high speed Its headed
straight for him

Alice has been deliberately drawing him into the glass corridor
Leading him into a trap

In a heartbeat the thin laser wire switches to a grid Fifty
interlocking laser lines forming a deadly net from which there
is no escape

ISAACSTYRANT
NO

But the IsaacsTyrant has no time to react as the grid passes
straight through him

CLOSE ON Alice as the laser grid stops barely an inch from her
nose

After a moment it disappears completely

CLOSE ON the IsaacsTyrant as the aqueous fluid begins to leak
from his eye A laser line has neatly bisected it straight
through the pupil Slowly the eye begins to slide apart
followed by the rest of his head

WIDEN to see the IsaacsTyrant fall into a hundred perfectly
cubed pieces Alice watches the IsaacsTyrant die exactly as
she watched One die in RESIDENT EVIL

She has come full circle

INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

LJ watches the live video feed of the IsaacsTyrant falling to
the floor in a hundred fleshy pieces In front of him the
computer flashes -- LASER SYSTEM DEACTIVATED

Their ragged peaks reflected in the glass of the cockpit Like
the rest of the survivors K-Mart is looking into an uncertain

future But one filled with new hope

A future Alice has given them
CUT TO
EXT TOKYO NIGHT

Desolate streets overrun with the Undead A reminder of the
nightmarish life that K-Mart and the others have left behind

The Camera sinks beneath the earth passing through the sewers
and the subway until we discover --

INT UMBRELLA JAPANESE FACILITY - CONFERENCE ROOM

A dimly lit space filled with gleaming high-tech surfaces Very
similar to the one in The Complex As before dominating the
room is a huge representation of the Globe - showing the
Umbrella spiderweb of secret bases spreading across the five
continents

Commander Okamoto sits at the head of a polished black
conference table HOLOGRAPHIC FIGURES at the table represent
the other Umbrella leaders - German English French Spanish
etc There is a conspicuous empty space where the holographic
image of Doctor Isaacs would normally sit

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
All attempts to contact the North
American complex continue to fail

GERMAN ENVOY
How long have they been off the air

COMMANDER OKAMOTO
72 hours We must consider them lost

Okamoto is cold and emotionless As if he were talking about
the loss of his wristwatch

COMMANDER OKAMOTO (CONTD)
But our plans remain unchanged All
data has been transferred to this
facility and the research will
continue under my personal
supervision I expect results within
one month two at the most

ALICE
(interrupting)
Oh you wont have to wait that long
boys
Much to everyones surprise a holographic image of Alice has
appeared Taking Isaacs‘ empty place at the table All eyes
are on her

ALICE (CONTD)
You see Im coming for you

INT THE COMPLEX - DOCTOR ISAACS LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE ON ALICE She is in front of a computer terminal
ALICE

and Im going to be bringing a

few friends
Alice is flanked by LJ and Paco But these are not the
friends that she was referring to For as we watch the Camera
TRACKS BACK AT HIGH SPEED past the cryo-stasis tubes to reveal -
A HUNDRED CLONES OF ALICE

All beginning to awaken

CUT TO BLACK
