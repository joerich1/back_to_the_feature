MEDIC
Tell him

SNAKE
Tell me what

Hauk thinks hes got him this time Snake doesnt like that

HAUK
That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and
flying off to Canada

Hauk shakes his head Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the
medic

SNAKE
What did you do to me asshole

HAUK

My idea Plissken Something weve been fooling around with Two
microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries Theyre already
starting
to dissolve In twenty-two hours the cores will completely dissolve
Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge Not a large
explosive

About the size of a pinhead Just big enough to --

(he gestures)

open up both your arteries Id say youd be dead in ten or fifteen
seconds --

Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat
SNAKE
TAKE THEM OUT NOW

MEDIC

Theyre protected by the cores Fifteen minutes before the last hour
is

up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays

Snake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch 225738 37 36 This
is his life hes watching tick away
