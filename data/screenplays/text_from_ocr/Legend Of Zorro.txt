FADE IN

In the darkness a single shaft of light First we HEAR
FOOTSTEPS then we see a familiar silhouette approaching

ZORRO Drawing his sword he SLASHES the screen forming the
letter “Z” through which FLAMES EXPLODE and --

INT DARKENED CAVE - DAY 1

As the flames dissipate were left with a single plume of
smoke BOOM DOWN to a flickering candle A YOUNG MAN
appears his face obscured in shadow He sits at the table
Picks up a QUILL Dips it in a bottle of INK As the quill
moves across the page we hear his VOICE

YOUNG MAN (VO)
It is my desire to put on record
these events which did shape the
course of my destiny

A drop of INK falls from his quill onto the page right next
to the word “DESTINY” A pinpoint of light appears inside
the letter ‘D’ -- it quickly CONSUMES THE FRAME

WHITEWASHING US TO

INT MISSION SANTA LUCIA - THE BELFRY DAY 2

The blazing sun CRANE DOWN to the iron mission bell as it
CLANGS swinging back and forth

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
- They begin in San Mateo the
province of my birth On that day
the people would decide if
California was to join the union as
its thirty first state

We MOVE down the bell rope to find a MONK tugging it

VOICE (0S)
« Brother Ignacio

The monk turns to see FRAY FELIPE curator of the mission

FRAY FELIPE
What are you doing

BROTHER IGNACIO
Five rings Padre - to summon
Zorro in case there’s trouble
FRAY FELIPE
If I know Zorro he’s already
here

And as he exits we TRACK through the open archway and TILT
DOWN in a glorious reveal to find a CROWD OF HUNDREDS A
banner reads “VOTE TODAY” SHOT CONTINUES over long lines
of people waiting to cast their votes

And we STOP ON THREE SOMBREROS Or more specifically three
PEASANTS inside curtained voting booths MOVE IN on their
ballots Two boxes two choices IN FAVOR OF THE
CONSTITUTION” “IN OPPOSITION TO THE CONSTITUTION” The
first peasant marks an “X” in favor of joining the union
TRACK to the next peasant -- he does too Now we come to the
third And instead of marking an X” this peasant marks a
“Z TILT UP TO ROGUISH EYES BEHIND A BLACK MASK

«- ZORRO To those who know his secrets he’s ALEJANDRO DE
LA VEGA Disguised as a peasant he opens the curtain drops
the ballot in a basket and as he LEAVES FRAME we begin

TRACKING along a row of MEN shouting from soapboxes a kind
of ‘speaker’s corner’ -- activists both for and against the
vote -- we STOP on a MAN handing out leaflets GUILLERMO

CORTEZ a young Che Guevara with a revolutionary’s passion

CORTEZ
Vote ‘yes’ to statehood This is
our day of independence Our day
of revolution

INT HOTEL ROOM - ABOVE THE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 3

CLOSE ON A MAN’S EYES filled with hate watching the crowd
through a window His hands sweep twin PISTOLS off a table
Burnished into one handle we read “SALVATION” Into the
other “DAMNATION” Now he reaches for a RIFLE BANDOLIER
Slings the strap over his back Turns to a CRACKED MIRROR --
and his face is revealed like a kaleidoscopic horror show

JACOB McGIVENS lean fierce a deadly piece of trouble ina
black frock coat and flat-brimmed hat The shape of a
CRUCIFIX has been BRANDED into his cheek clear through his
right eye and onto his forehead McGivens slips on the hat
and exits a warrior going into battle

EXT MISSION SANTA LUCIA - DAY 4

In the crowd we find a 10 YEAR-OLD BOY
A wildness about him -- like a colt ready to run As he
pushes through the voters a HAND grabs his ear - he WINCES
and looks up at

FRAY FELIPE
Nifio why aren’t you at school

THE BOY
But Padre what if Zorro comes

FRAY FELIPE
I‘ll make sure he carves a ‘Z’ into
your backside now how does that

sound
THE BOY
(excited by the prospect)
Really
FRAY FELIPE
HOME

The boy runs off Shaking his head Felipe scoops up the a
basket filled with votes heads off As he clears frame

- we FIND the corner where the kid just disappeared After
a beat his face REAPPEARS and he sneaks back into the crowd
rd) passing a FRUIT CART Stealing an APPLE he creeps on as

FRAY FELIPE arrives at a table where the GOVERNOR’S TABULATOR
is counting ballots calculating the results on a TALLY
CERTIFICATE Two uniformed RURALES stand beside him rifles
in hand Felipe sets down the basket

FRAY FELIPE
The final votes Amigo

TRACK ON TO A YOUNG WOMAN Very pregnant sweating in the
sun This is BLANCA CORTEZ wife to Guillermo Cortez the
revolutionary we just met Seeing her lower herself to sit
Cortez hops off his soapbox and runs over concerned

CORTEZ
Are you all right Mi Amor

BLANCA
The baby’s kicking that’s all

CORTEZ
Here have some water

It’s easy to see the love between them
Now our camera REACQUIRES the Tabulator -- he locks the tally
r) certificate inside a BOX and says to Felipe

TABULATOR
Once we get this to the governor
it’ll be official - let’s hope the
rest of California voted the same
eh

He hands the box to one of the Rurales who loads it onto a
wagon Felipe cautions the Rurale

FRAY FELIPE
Be careful Hombre you carry the
future of our state in your hands

SUDDENLY A MAN’S VOICE SINGS through the courtyard

MANS VOICE (0S)
‘How glorious is our heavenly King
Who reigns above the sky
How shall a child presume to sing
His dreadful majesty’

And now the crowd has parted to reveal

MCGIVENS
I come to deliver The Lord’s word
against this vote Babylon was
condemned to ashes for extending
its empire to inferior races

FRAY FELIPE
What right do you have to preach
gospel McGivens You speak for
the railroad

MCGIVENS
(touching his crucifix
scar)
Here’s my right just as He sent
his only son to endure mortal
suffering my daddy branded me with
my own cross to bear

Cortez SPITS at McGivens’ boots
CORTEZ
You force us to sell our land then
use us as slave labor You can’t
intimidate us anymore

r A swell of CHEERS

McGivens draws back his coat to emphasize his PISTOLS The
r Rurales quickly level their rifles Everyone tenses --

MCGIVENS
My my it’s damnably hot out
here I believe the devil is upon
us Now what say you hand over
that ballot box

TABULATOR
A pointless crime Sir youd only
force the people to vote again

With a fearless grin McGivens SNAPS the SOUND OF MULTIPLE
MUSKETS COCKING fills the square We WHIP to SIX RIFLEMEN on
the rooftops McGivens‘ posse surrounding the courtyard

The Rurales freeze finding themselves avel nat ere

Tense beats The frightened people Among them the young
boy Finally with no choice the Rurales drop their guns

MCGIVENS
With the proper persuadin’ people
got a funny way of having their
minds changed Savvy

TABULATOR
I command you in the name of civil
order -- tell your men to disarm

In a flash McGivens unslings his RIFLE from its bandolier
and FIRES OFF TWELVE ROUNDS AT ONCE pockmarking the wall
around the tabulator’s head and the suspender straps on his

shoulders -- causing his pants to drop to the ground No
ones ever seen a gun fire like that
MCGIVENS

Latest model in heavy artillery --
the Henry repeating rifle If God
didn’t hurl lightning he’d surely
carry one of these Now I’m gonna
count to ‘one’

He COCKS the rifle again aims at the terrified tabulator
and as McGivens opens his mouth to say ‘One’ A BLACK
FEDORA ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR STRIKING HIM ON THE BRIDGE OF
THE NOSE He tumbles off his horse and lands in the dust

SNAP TO ZORRO standing on a rooftop -- he WAVES to the
crowd The people ROAR -- among them the boy who’s beyond
gleeful with exhilaration

Zorro leaps off the roof onto the balcony below the posse
SHOOTING AT HIM as he goes -—-

McGivens pulls himself up off the ground enraged firing
double-fisted into the air to clear a path to the wagon
Leaping on an APPLE CORE splats the side of his head -- he
WHIRLS to see the boy having flung the apple with a
SLINGSHOT --

McGivens locks eyes with the boy as he contemplates bloody
murder but there’s no time to spare -- McGivens CRACKS the
reing AND BLASTS AWAY CARRYING THE LOCK BOX

TABULATOR
He’s getting away with the ballots

The posse leaps from the rooftops onto waiting horses
galloping after the wagon as it thunders through the fleeing
peasants heading straight for A FRIGHTENED LITTLE GIRL

Across the square her hysterical mother’s been cut off by

the frantic crowd Zorro LEAPS from the roof -- catching a
HANGING BANNER he SWINGS over the crowd snatching up the

girl MERE SECONDS before she’s run over by the wagon

Zorro deposits the girl right into her mother’s arms then
whistles TORNADO CHARGES INTO VIEW Zorro LEAPS on racing

after the posse -- as he clears frame we HOLD ON
TWO DARK-SUITED MEN Notably out of place in the peasant

crowd Who are they Without a word they climb onto their
horses and follow passing

Fray Felipe in the crush of peasants -- he picks Zorro’s
Fedora off the ground and HANDS IT TO HIM as he races by
Watching him go Felipe kisses a CRUCIFIX NECKLACE

FRAY FELIPE
Godspeed Alejandro --

EXT STREETS OF SAN MATEO - MARKETPLACE CONTINUOUS 5

McGivens races the wagon through a MARKETPLACE tearing
through hanging clothes hens vegetable carts -- havoc
panic and destruction in every direction He turns to see if
Zorro’s following He isn’t Grinning McGivens wheels back
around to face the road ahead but

ZORRO APPEARS IN FRONT OF HIM ROUNDING A CORNER ON TORNADO
Leaping off he catches hold of an INDUSTRIAL HOOK AND ROPE
and THROWS IT under the wagon -- it catches an AXLE -- the
rope uncoils then GOES TAUT FLIPPING THE WAGON OVER
McGivens goes FLYING so does the lock box which lands in
Zorro’s hands He grabs a nearby rope and swings onto A
VIADUCT UNDER REPAIR Zorro lands perfectly on MULTI-LAYERED
SCAFFOLDING Just as he finds his feet McGivens’ posse
converges around him and

A FIGHT ON THE SCAFFOLDING ENSUES Zorro attacking and
defending dodging bullets slashing the ropes binding the
scaffolding together -- and it COLLAPSES sending the posse
down into the water below

As Zorro whirls McGivens’ FIST knocks him back The box
skids away The men exchange deadly blows on what remains of
the scaffolding tumbling together from landing to landing --
McGivens plunges a KNIFE but Zorro grabs his wrist

MCGIVENS
Only the Devil hides his face from
God

Teeth clenched Zorro struggles as McGivens presses the blade
CLOSER TO THE STRAP SECURING HIS MASK threatening to expose
Alejandro’s identity FINALLY HE CUTS IT

But just as the mask FALLS OFF Zorro SLAMS McGivens in the
gut -- he CRASHES back onto one end of the plank

Zorro reaches for his mask but IT FLUTTERS AWAY As McGivens
rises Zorro leaps -- the other end of the plank SNAPS UP
like a see-saw SLAMMING RIGHT INTO McGIVENS’ FACE AND --

The bloody teeth land at Zorro’s feet He tears a shred of
black cloth from his sleeve then draws his dagger and SLICES
EYEHOLES Scooping the box under his arm he SWINGS back to
Tornado landing perfectly in the saddle

ZORRO
Over the hill to the governors
mansion
(the horse doesn’t move)
I said over the hill to the
governor’s mansion

Nothing Zorro sighs and repeats -- this time in Spanigh

ZORRO
Sobre la colina a la mansi6én del
gobernador
(and as Tornado PLUNGES
forward )
We have to work on your English --

As they clear frame we RACK FOCUS to reveal THE DARK-
SUITED MEN Watching from the brush

EXT GOVERNOR’S MANSION - SAN MATEO - DAY 6

A CROWD waits anxiously at the gates A MURMUR grows they
see their hero approaching

THE CROWD
ZORRO MIRA EL ZORRO

Zorro rides through the gates Waiting on the front steps is
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR BENNET RILEY his AIDE beside him
Seeing Zorro Riley’s stunned and cautious

GOVERNOR RILEY
Where are my men

ZORRO
They were held up Governor I
offered my help

Dismounting he hands the lock box to the governor who opens
it and quickly sifts through the tally certificates Each
bears the same verdict And so Riley announces

GOVERNOR RILEY
Citizens of San Mateo we are no
longer simply Californians we
are now Americans

The crowd ERUPTS Sombreros FLY A great celebration is
taking place The governor offers a hand to Zorro

GOVERNOR RILEY (CONT’D)
The people owe you their freedom

ZORRO
I accept no debts from the people
Governor I’m one of them

And in a grand gesture Zorro draws his sword and REARS UP ON
TORNADO Cape billowing -- an icon -- as the CHEERING
SWELLS Finally Zorro gallops off And in an instant he
has disappeared

EXT ESTABLISHING SHOT - DUSK 7
An epic vista of the west the De La Vega hacienda

surrounded by beautiful countryside In the distance we see
San Francisco and the sea

EXT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA -— DUSK 8

Zorro guides Tornado through a shallow pond past the sparse
silhouette of a HUGE TREE

INT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - SECRET CAVE - NIGHT 9

In the privacy of his lair Alejandro removes his mask and
closes Tornado in a stall feeding him a sugar cube As he
turns to go Tornado WHINNIES for more

ALEJANDRO
Eh eh -- your saddle’s getting a
little tight Amigo

He gives Tornado a carrot and walks away A beat then the
carrot SAILS past Alejandro’s head

In the doorway a WOMAN appears in silhouette And we can
tell just by the contours of her face she may in fact be the
most beautiful one in the world

ELENA DE LA VEGA steps into the LIGHT They look at each
other a long moment and they KISS and it’s a passionate
hungry one that tells us how desperately in love they are
Finally she pulls back

ELENA
Tell me we won tell me we’re
free

ALEJANDRO

-- We’re free

She wraps her arms around him wanting to laugh as much as
she needs to cry After a beat

ALEJANDRO
Where’s Joaquin

ELENA
He wasn’t feeling well this
morning he’s been asleep all day

INT HACIENDA - BEDROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT 10
Under the sheets is the sleeping form of a child A window

swings open -- a YOUNG BOY appears climbing a tree and
tumbling into the room

We realize he’s the same 10 year-old kid from the square
JOAQUIN DE LA VEGA son to Alejandro and Elena

As Joaquin finds his feet he hears his PARENTS’ FOOTSTEPS
outside the door Racing to the bed he hurls back the

sheets to reveal the ‘sleeping form’ is a stack of pillows
Jumping in he pulls up the covers as the doorknob turns

Elena and Alejandro enter quietly Joaquin’s the portrait of
angelic innocence eyes closed a little bead of sweat on his
brow Alejandro gently brushes it away

ALEJANDRO
His fever’s breaking

Elena moves to close the window Stops confused

ELENA
I thought I closed this

Alert Joaquin begins to MOAN drawing her attention away

JOAQUIN
«- Mama Is that you

ELENA
(leans in kisses him)
Shh go back to sleep Mi Amor

ALEJANDRO
We’1ll leave the light on eh

JOAQUIN
I’m too old for that

Alejandro grins and turns down the kerosene lamp the flame
low Kissing his son he heads out with Elena His parents
gone Joaquin turns the lamp back up -- he’s still afraid of
the dark after all And with a sneaky little grin he
settles in to sleep

EXT HALLWAY OUTSIDE JOAQUIN’S ROOM — CONTINUOUS ll

In the hallway Elena smiles a sexy smile whispers close

ELENA
We’1l have to be quiet

And now Alejandro’s smiling too because he knows what she’s
getting at A sweet hot moment

ALEJANDRO
« Oh bless the silence

INT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - PARLOR - NIGHT 12

MOVING over articles of clothing left scattered in the heat
of passion we find Elena and Alejandro curled under a
blanket by the fireplace She reaches over pours froma
bottle of tequila -- two shots

ALEJANDRO
To statehood

ELENA
- TO us

(they clink then)
I wish I could have been there

ALEJANDRO
You were

He’s lost in her They sling back their shots she nuzzles
into his chest A warm moment

ELENA

For ten years we’ve been dreaming
of a day when the law would protect
the people

(beat)
We can finally take Joaquin on a
trip to Spain I can’t imagine how
it’s changed since I left

ALEJANDRO
(pause )
Elena I’ve been thinking

ELENA
(good natured)
Never a good sign

ALEJANDRO
I’d love us to go but it may be
some time before the new laws are
in place

ELENA
-- What are you saying

ALEJANDRO
Only that the Federal Marshals may
need help getting things under
control

She sits up alert --
ELENA
Alejandro we agreed when
California became a state youd
give it up --

ALEJANDRO
And I will no doubt about it
soon very soon --

ELENA
You‘ve been saying that since
Joaquin was born --

ALEJANDRO
(gestures with his hands)
Yes but look here’s me here’s
quitting -- we’re this far apart -

ELENA
Is that right Well here’s you
and here’s me strangling you
Joaquin’s on the verge of becoming
aman and you’re missing it

ALEJANDRO
I’m not missing anything

ELENA
Oh really What’s his teacher’s
name

ALEJANDRO
Thats easy Mr --

wrong)
Brother --

Father Father Kin
(muffled)
es jin hoofer

She’s glaring at him her point made

ALEJANDRO
Okay so I have a bad memory
what’s that prove

ELENA
What instrument has he been
learning

ALEJANDRO
- The piano
(she shakes her head
wrong)
Guitar
(again wrong)
The triangle

ELENA
He doesn’t aninst ent

ALEJANDRO
(caught angry)
Are you saying I’m a bad father

ELENA
I’m saying you can only be great at
one thing Alejandro wearing the
mask or raising our son you
can’t do both

ALEJANDRO
So youd let Joaquin go on
believing I’m nothing more than a
wealthy Don who only cares about
ordering servants around

ELENA
Is that what you think I do all
day Order servants around

ALEJANDRO
Now you’re putting words in my
mouth -

ELENA

That’s your foot you’re tasting
You promised me this would end

ALEJANDRO
And I promised your father Zorro
would never abandon the people

ELENA
My father died because he wore that
mask

In the distance the CHURCH BELL RINGS to summon Zorro A
‘perfect timing’ moment if there ever was one Finally

ALEJANDRO
It‘s who I am Elena

ELENA
If you walk out that door take a
change of clothes because you
won’t be sleeping here tonight

ALEJANDRO
« What happened to the woman who
fought by my side

ELENA
I’m fighting now for my family

And she’s right The bell RINGS AGAIN A terrible moment
He’s desperately torn Finally

ALEJANDRO
I‘1l1 make it up to you I promise

And he leaves her there her heart sinking off which --

EXT HILLS ABOVE THE DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - NIGHT 13

Zorro and Tornado WHIP through frame galloping off toward
the ringing bell Zorro pulls up at the top of the hill
framed turns back loneliness on his face

INT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA PARLOR — NIGHT 14

Elena stands at the open window watching her husband‘s
silhouette on the distant hill after a beat horse and
rider GALLOP OFF Sadly Elena closes the window

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - TELEGRAPH HILL - DAY 15

A town on the brink of change the gold rush is on the days
of the Old West are giving way to cobblestone streets and
telegraph wire

In the crowd we find ELENA AND JOAQUIN as she walks him to
school He’s looking moody glum She’s still carrying last
night’s fight and its lack of resolution but tries to hide
it As they pass a hotel she offers

ELENA
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with‘H’

JOAQUIN
Why wasn’t Papi at breakfast

A child’s intuition he stares accusingly She covers --

ELENA

I told you he left early on

business
JOAQUIN

He’s always away on business
ELENA

(beat sadly)
-- I know

(forcing a smile)
But he always comes back

By now they’ve arrived at school and the bell is RINGING --
he turns heading up the steps with the other kids Elena’s
suddenly filled with longing

ELENA
Joaquin
(with love and worry)
Behave yourself Mi Amor

We see him struggle to find his words then finally

JOAQUIN
Hotel Starts with the letter ‘H’

And he disappears into the school Elena walks on feeling
an uncertain future

Then she catches a reflection in a store window TWO MEN ARE
FOLLOWING HER We RECOGNIZE THEM as the dark-suited
strangers from the opening Elena doesn’t turn Keeps
walking heart pounding Veers into an alley The men do

too but Elena’s gone They stop confused

Suddenly she swings from an alcove behind them -- HER FIST
FLIES INTO THE FIRST MAN’S FACE he tumbles back as she SNAPS
OFF A FLAGPOLE bearing the California state flag uses it to
defend herself against the second man

The fast-paced fight continues as we BOOM UP AND OVER THEM
for a moment giving us a dramatic point of view on Elena and
her fighting skills Finally she sends him plummeting
backward SPINS to finish off the first man but finds herself
staring INTO T OF H

FIRST MAN
Normally one signals surrender by
waving the flag In your case
dropping it’1ll do

She does The man lowers his gun Well call him HARRIGAN
He’s heavier than his slimmer partner PIKE -- they’re
otherwise identical

ELENA
» Who are you

PIKE
The relevant question Sefiora De La
Vega is who are YOU

HARRIGAN
You have a unique family history --

PIKE
Take your step-father for example
Don Raphael Montero -- a seditious
aristocrat who nearly destroyed
California

HARRIGAN
Quite unlike your real father Don
Diego De La Vega - a man of
principle

PIKE

And in a twist worthy of
Shakespeare they killed each other
in a duel for your affection

HARRIGAN
The question is between your two
fathers whose spirit lives on in
your heart
She doesn’t like this not one bit

ELENA
What do you want

PIKE
Your help

And off his creepy grin --

INT CALIFORNIA GENTLEMAN’S CLUB - STEAM ROOM - DAY 16

Turkish motif light beams through a mosaic ceiling onto a
steaming tub of DONS playing poker Alejandro among them
They smoke cigars and toss their cards on a FLOATING TRAY

DON VERDUGO
I tell you De La Vega women say
they want one thing but what they
really want is everything else

ALEJANDRO
You don’t know Elena

DON DIAZ
You must show her who wears the
pantalones in the family get in
touch with your manhood

ALEJANDRO
A fine idea if I want my manhood
chopped off with a machete

DON ROBAU
Think of this as a vacation from
the shackles of matrimony

ALEJANDRO
Isn‘t it possible our wives married
us because they WANT to spend time
with us

The Dons all LAUGH --

BON VERDUGO
My wife hates me

DON ROBAU
Mine too

DON DIAZ

Mine’s a life-sucking beast who
lives only to humiliate me

ALEJANDRO
So let me understand this if I
take your advice and do nothing I
can look forward to spending my
days pruning in a tub of naked men

The men stare at him collectively smiling Alejandro throws
his cards on the tray and gets out of the tub --

ALEJANDRO
Thanks for the advice

DON VERDUGO
Where are you going

ALEJANDRO
To beg Elenas forgiveness

Wrapping a towel around his waist he turns and bumps into a
MAN Pinstripe suit spectacles His thick glasses are
STEAMED UP He wipes them off squints --

MAN
Goodness me might one of you be
Don Alejandro De La Vega

ALEJANDRO
« Yes

MAN
Im here on behalf of your wife

If you should have any questions
my address is on the letterhead
Good day Sir

He goes Alejandro opens the envelope Pulls out a piece of
paper As he reads his jaw drops in total disbelief
Confused furious he marches off HURLING the paper away

It lands in the water The Dons lean in then share a grave
rd look We PUSH IN on the letterhead “ISSUANCE OF PROCEEDINGS

FOR DIVORCE” And as the ink begins to BLUR

cUT TO BLACK In the darkness these words appear

It‘s Latin I learned it in school
-- it means I don’t wanna grow up
to be a rich Don okay

ALEJANDRO
Hey I‘m your father don’t you
talk to me like that And stop
using words I don’t understand

JOAQUIN
If you’re my father how come you’re
never around That’s why mom left
you all you care about is
business

That strikes Alejandro at his core A pained moment

ALEJANDRO
There’s nothing on this earth I
wouldn’t do for you or your mother
Joaquin Nothing

CORTEZ (0S)
Don De La Vega

Alejandro turns to find GUILLERMO CORTEZ the revolutionary
we met in our opening and his wife BLANCA From the back
of a wagon that serves as their stall a SIGN advertises GOLD
MINING EQUIPMENT (shovels pikes lanterns)

ALEJANDRO
Guillermo Blanca how’s
business

CORTEZ
Never better We’1l be able to pay
you back sooner than we thought

ALEJANDRO
I told you Compadre it was a
gift To celebrate your marriage

BLANCA
Dios mio Joaquin youre getting
s0 big --

Joaquin shrugs half-smiles Cortez notices a CUSTOMER back
turned using one of the KNIVES on the display table to CARVE
something we can’t see

CORTEZ
Uh Sefior that knife is only two
dollars
As the man turns we see he’s sharpening a pair of WOODEN
TEETH He POPS them into his mouth -- it’s JACOB McGIVENS
MCGIVENS

Tell you what give ya five
hundred For that I’1ll take this
here blade and the deed to your
rancho

BLANCA
(fierce hating him)
We already gave you our answer

CORTEZ
Tell whatever scum you’re working
for now that we’re protected by The
Constitution

McGivens spins the knife STABBING it into the table

MCGIVENS
-»- God fearin’ family man like
you Might wanna re-order his
priorities

ALEJANDRO
He said he’s not selling

MCGIVENS
- We met before fella

ALEJANDRO
I‘d remember a man with wooden
teeth

MCGIVENS
-- You think you’re bad medicine
huh A Mex-breed like you

Alejandro wants to destroy this man but knows he has to set
an example for Joaquin McGivens sees the look

MCGIVENS
Think your pappy’s gonna crow
Little Man Or’s he gonna cluck

ALEJANDRO
Leave him out of thi--

McGivens abruptly SLAPS Alejandro’s face HARD Joaquin
lurches forward to defend his father but Alejandro holds him
at bay Jaw clenched with suppressed rage Alejandro’s
fighti insti in his bones fight back

ALEJANDRO
Sefior as a gentlemen I’m obliged
to teach my son to turn the other
chee--

McGivens SLAPS Alejandro’s other cheek --

MCGIVENS
Y’mean that cheek

And that’s it Alejandro moves forward to fight --

CONSTABLE (0S)
Everything all right Boys

A CONSTABLE has appeared Alejandro eyes burning backs
away McGivens tips his hat

MCGIVENS
Respects to you Officer
respects respects

The constable strolls on McGivens climbs onto his horse
saying to Cortez

MCGIVENS
Think about my offer now Think
hard

And he pivots the horse its butt KNOCKING over the table
Tools go crashing As McGivens disappears Joaquin glares up
at his father in a shameful rage And off that look

EXT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - FRONT COURTYARD -— DAY 21

A Hansom Cab comes to a stop by the front gate In the
coach Alejandro watches Joaquin gather his things

ALEJANDRO
I‘ll pick you up again tomorrow
okay

JOAQUIN
(muttering)
-- bye --

ALEJANDRO
«e- Joaquin
(the best smile he can
muster)
Keep your chin up eh

But Joaquin goes without answering Alejandro’s heart sinks
Then Sensing something his look tracks up to the veranda

ELENA has been watching him her eyes filled with longing
Caught she turns sharply and heads inside Alejandro aches
for her Finally he nods to his driver and the carriage
plunges away the music of a DANCE ORCHESTRA bridges us to

EXT THE VINEYARD HACIENDA - NIGHT 22

A sprawling hacienda ringed by an extraordinary vineyard In
the front gardens a lavish party is underway Two flags
hang side-by-side the American flag and the French tri-
color In the crowd of well-attired people we find Alejandro
and Felipe walking along

FRAY FELIPE
See A little spit a little
polish -- you don’t look like a
stray Chihuahua anymore

ALEJANDRO
Ten minutes then I’m going

FRAY FELIPE
Listen this party’s the only
reason I‘m not at confession
forgiving horny widows for trying

to make it with the gardener -- you
will not ruin my night off
comprende

Felipe scoops a glass of wine from a tray savoring the
scent Alejandro begins picking through a table of canapes

FRAY FELIPE
(sips)
Ahh effervescent yet tenacious

ALEJANDRO
rolling his eyes)
Who owns this vineyard anyway

FRAY FELIPE
I’m told he’s a count recently in
from France He’s asked me to
bless the wine

ALEJANDRO
A Frenchman you say I expect
he’s still in his parlor putting on
makeup

PARTY GUEST (0S)
- Or his perfume perhaps

Another GUEST is admiring the table Alejandro grins

ALEJANDRO
Rumor has it the French invented it
to avoid bathing

PARTY GUEST
(as they LAUGH together)
And you are

ALEJANDRO
De La Vega Alejandro De La Vega

PARTY GUEST
You’re De La Vega What an honor
I‘ve heard so much about you

ALEJANDRO
Really From whom

PARTY GUEST
You know I’d love to continue this
conversation but I’m wanted
elsewhere Please excuse me --

The man moves off Alejandro turns back to Felipe --

ALEJANDRO
I just met a most charming fellow

FRAY FELIPE
And who might that be

CLINK CLINK CLINK their HOST is tapping a glass from a
small STAGE in the courtyard Alejandro’s face falls it’s
he same man he was just talking to at the buffet table
COUNT ARMAND COMPTE DE LA FERE dashing cordial -- ina
word perfect Behind him his SERVANT stands guard FERROQ

ARMAND
Welcome Friends Californians
Americans you may be guests in
my home tonight but I am your
guest in this great country For
five hundred years Europe has been
the cultural and economic center of
the world but with the admittance
of California into the union
America stands to become the next
great superpower This vineyard
represents my hope that our two
continents will rise to meet the
future together vines from my
homeland in France taking root in
your fertile soil -- a state
blessed with limitless beauty
but none more stunning than my
escort for the evening Sefiora
Elena De La Vega

And Alejandros blood drains from his body as in slow
motion ELENA ascends the stage to meet Armand He gently
KISSES HER A FIREWORKS DISPLAY behind them IGNITES
becoming a red white and blue SPARKLING AMERICAN FLAG

Alejandro looks like a man whos just been given a death
sentence Felipe quickly interjects

FRAY FELIPE
Well I’m pooped Time to go

ALEJANDRO
« GO Why would we go I’m
having so much FUN

He GUZ2ZLES his wine stalking forward as Elena and Armand
begin shaking hands with guests her smile pans from one to
the next THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY AND WITH TOTAL SHOCK ON

ELENA
Alejandro

ALEJANDRO
(seething smile)
Elena

ARMAND
(a touch of concern)
« Elena

ELENA
(caught)
Armand

ARMAND
(nods )
De La Vega

ALEJANDRO
(nods)
Count

ELENA
(REALLY confused)
You know each other

ARMAND
We shared a giggle at the buffet
table

ALEJANDRO
It seems that’s not all we’ve
shared

ARMAND
Allow me to diffuse an awkward
situation -- Elena’s portrayed you

as a man of impeccable character

ALEJANDRO
I’m honored to be mentioned at all
Why I nearly forgot we were still

married only three months ago

Felipe urgently tries to pull Alejandro off

Td FRAY FELIPE
A blessing on your vineyard Count
thanks so much for having us--

ALEJANDRO
(yanks away)
Don’t be rude Felipe I’m just
dying to know how the lovebirds
met

Just then GOVERNOR RILEY - we remember him from the opening
-- approaches with a SOUTHERN COLONEL During what follows
Alejandro will be steadily guzzling wine from passing trays --

ARMAND
Ah Governor Riley you honor me
with your presence

GOVERNOR RILEY
Thanks to you Count this vineyard
may become a growth industry for
California

ARMAND
(nods then)
) May I introduce Colonel RS
Beauregard of the First Alabama
Infantry

ELENA
And what brings you to California
Colonel

COLONEL BEAUREGARD
Diplomacy My Dear -- rumblings of
secession could lead to war between
the North and South The governor
was just assuring me California’s
committed to avoiding such a
catastrophe

ALEJANDRO
Forgive me Colonel I may not be a
learned politician but perhaps one
way to avoid war would be to oh I
dunno free the slaves

The colonel GLARES at Alejandro Elena quickly tries to
change the subject --

ELENA

Darling you know how boring I find
politics

Alejandro blanches -- Elena not interested in politics

ARMAND

I believe Don Alejandro has a
point Cherie However I salute
your effort to avoid war Colonel

GOVERNOR RILEY

(to Beauregard)
As do I In fact you’re invited
to be my guest at our flag-raising
ceremony next week so you can see
firathand the peaceable spirit of
our citizens

The colonel nods his thanks as MUSIC BEGINS and couples start
forming for a LINE DANCE Seizing the opportunity Elena
grabs Armand’s hand

ELENA

Shall we Darling

ARMAND

Excuse us Gentlemen

And they’re off
wine reeling

Alejandro watches them go slugging more

FRAY FELIPE

Perhaps you shouldn’t drink so much
on an empty stomach

ALEJANDRO

Perhaps you should wear lipstick if
you want to act like my mother

So saying he grabs Felipe and drags him from frame --

FRAY FELIPE

Alejandro wai--

ON THE DANCE FLOOR all the partners face each other in

parallel lines

Elena swings into Armand’s arms wearing her

best smile It isn’t easy He sees that --

ARMAND

Say the word and Ill escort you

home

ELENA
And leave your guests

ARMAND
In a heartbeat I care for you too
much to subject you to an evening
of forced smiles Elena

She smiles appreciatively They spin Elena shifting to her
next partner in line -- IT’S ALEJANDRO He pulls her close

ALEJANDRO
Won’t your boyfriend be jealous

Armand’s swept into the arms of a BOUFFANTED WOMAN who
presses him toward her enormous cleavage He strains to keep
on eye on Elena during

ELENA
I didn’t want you to find out like
this

ALEJANDRO

Ah so that’s why you refused to
see me these last few months you
were sparing my feelings --

ELENA
You’re drunk --

ALEJANDRO
Youre the one not acting like
yourself Since when do politics
bore you

Like musical chairs they shift partners again Elena returns
to Armand --

ARMAND
If you wish I‘1l have him escorted
out

ELENA

I can handle him

Alejandro and Felipe dance side-by-side facing their
respective partners --

FRAY FELIPE
For the love of God let’s get out
of this place --

ALEJANDRO
I can handle her

The line shifts again Elena returning to Alejandro -

ALEJANDRO
You must tell me how you met

ELENA
Years ago in Spain We went to
finishing school together

ALEJANDRO
How nice you were reunited so he
could finish

ELENA
Don’t force me to embarrass you

ALEJANDRO
Sorry too late

Again they switch this time Alejandro and Armand end up
side-by-side --

ALEJANDRO
Tell me Count where does your
title rank among noblemen Is it
higher than say a duke

ARMAND
It’s rather common actually --
much like a Don

Shift again Armand returns to Bouffant Lady Alejandro to
Elena --

ALEJANDRO
He’s a delight Rich good
looking and royalty

ELENA
Is there anything I can say that
would make you leave

ALEJANDRO
You could fall to your knees and
beg me to take you back

ELENA
I wouldn’t want to ruin my dress

ALEJANDRO
It’s just as well I’m enjoying
single life

ELENA
Is that supposed to make me
jealous
ALEJANDRO
Does it
ELENA
(jealously)
Never
ALEJANDRO
Good so tell me -- who’s been

looking after Joaquin while his
mother spends her nights out

ELENA
Idon’t spend my nights out

(composing herself)
And I haven’t told Joaquin Now I
think you should go

She starts to break away but he spins her back to him -

ALEJANDRO ELENA
I finally understand why you
left me Elena -- -- let go --

-- you finally found a man

whos happy to stay at home

ordering servants around -- -- Now I KNOW you’re drunk --
-- your step-father would’ve

been so proud to see you take -- Keep your voice down --
your rightful place on the

arm of royalty Well

congratulations your

highness--
AND ELENA SLAPS HIM HARD The entire party has gone SILENT

Everyone’s staring Finally Elena says voice full of hurt

ELENA
If you don’t know me better than
that then you never knew me at
all

Now he looks ashamed And regretful from his heart Armand
mercifully signals to the orchestra and MUSIC begins playing
again Alejandro bows to him in deference

ALEJANDRO
Thank you for your hospitality
Count

His eyes fall to Elena all he wants is to take back what he
said But he goes A beat then Elena turns to Armand

ELENA
I should explain --

ARMAND
(delicately)
Please don’t If I lost you I
wouldn’t be able to control myself
either

Elena smiles her appreciation but fights to maintain
composure -- burdened perhaps by more than she can let on

EXT ALLEY NIGHT 23

ALEJANDRO‘S FACE drunk eyes closed At first we think he’s
lying on cobblestones but as we TILT AROUND we reveal he’s
SITTING UPRIGHT on Tornado they’re BOTH leaning against an
alley wall and what’s more -- they’re BOTH DRUNK Alejandro
drops a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA it clinks to the ground Tornado
licking booze as it flows onto the cobblestone --

ALEJANDRO
« Hey haven’t you had enough
(drunken wobble)
Tell me something horse to man
have you ever felt the cold stab of
loves betrayal

Tornado BURPS Alejandro RECOILS in disgust loses his
balance and TUMBLES from the saddle Tornado TAKES OFF
disappearing around a corner

ALEJANDRO
Hey AREN’T YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING ESTUPIDO

VOICE (0S)
There you are

The voice startles Alejandro Fray Felipe has appeared above
him Sighing he helps Alejandro to his feet

ALEJANDRO
Next time you want to lift my
spirits just shoot me in my sleep

And now they’re walking along -- well Alejandro’s stumbling

L FRAY FELIPE
I didn’t know she’d be there
Alejandro
ALEJANDRO

How could she choose a man like
that ‘Count’ Armand with his
fancy wine and that froufrou
accent

FRAY FELIPE
I’1ll admit Elena didn’t seem to be
quite herself tonight but she’s
your ex-wife now -- EX from the
Latin root ‘Exeunt’ meaning exit
meaning goodbye And if Armand is
a decent man be happy for her

ALEJANDRO
If he’s a decent man -- if from
the Latin root ‘Iffy’ meaning
questionable

FRAY FELIPE
Youre in no shape to discuss this
rd) Alejandro --

ALEJANDRO
I’ll make her want me back so badly
shell be weeping with desire
Nobody leaves my tequila worm
dangling in the wind

FRAY FELIPE
If you wish to go on embarrassing
yourself I want no part of it

And he goes Alejandro stumbles after him --

ALEJANDRO
I‘1l have you know I’m perfectly
capable of embarrassing myself
myself Hear my vow Padre
Alejandro De La Vega always lands
on his fee--

And he TRIPS lurching from frame Off which --

EXT TOWN SQUARE - CHINATOWN - MIDNIGHT 24

A CLOCK strikes midnight above the deserted square Far
below a rickshaw rides past Chinatown storefronts It stops
at a CURIO SHOP A CLOAKED PASSENGER steps off -- Elena

She knocks a SHOP MERCHANT appears eyes boring into her

MERCHANT
Were closed

ELENA
I was hoping to buy a gift for my
ailing grandmother

His expression changes and he opens the door for her to
enter

INT CURIO SHOP - NIGHT 25

The merchant lifts a curtain to reveal a BACK ROOM wherein
we find the TWO MEN Elena fought in the alley HARRIGAN and
PIKE are seated at a table playing Mahjong

HARRIGAN
I’d offer you my chair but I
assume youd find it patronizing

PIKE
How was the party

HARRIGAN
Tell us about The Count ---

PIKE
Who was he talking to

HARRIGAN
What did he say

ELENA
He spent most of the night talking
to the Senator and a Southern
Colonel I think his name was
Beauregard

PIKE
(a severe glance to
Harrigan)
Troubling

HARRIGAN
You have a new assignment we
believe Armand keeps a telegraph
receiver somewhere in his hacienda

PIKE
You do know what a telegraph
receiver is

ELENA
How could I I’m just a woman

HARRIGAN
(cocky smile)
I love your spirit

PIKE
The Count’s been receiving messages
from overseas -- we need to know

what they say

HARRIGAN
You’1l steal the carbon ribbon
deliver it to us

ELENA
(a beat)
And if I refuse

PIKE
Then we’ll have to remind you
you have no choice

With unnerving calm Harrigan reaches into his pocket and
pulls out THE MASK OF ZORRO The one Alejandro lost in
the viaduct opening The cruel threat lands on Elena --

ELENA
I’1lL send you both to hell for
this

HARRIGAN

e But of course

PIKE
Until then we‘ll be waiting for
that ribbon Good evening Sefiora

They go back to their game ignoring her Elena livid
heart heavy finally turns on her heel And goes

EXT ALLEY - NEXT DAY 26

Alejandro is snoring A TONGUE begins licking his cheek
Stirring he smiles and mumbles

ALEJANDRO
Oh Elena you feel so soft

His eyes open

ALEJANDRO’S POV FISH-EYE LENS - A PIG is staring down at us
its tongue flicking the lens Alejandro BOLTS upright --

ALEJANDRO
Bad pig Shoo

He looks down realizing he passed out in the gutter wearing
the same clothes from last night At that very moment two
PEOPLE ride past on horseback Alejandro catches a glimpse
of the riders

ELENA AND ARMAND They stop in the marketplace ahead
Determined dusting himself off Alejandro follows

EXT THE MARKETPLACE CONTINUOUS 27
Armand extends a hand to help Elena dismount -

ELENA
Thank you Darling

ARMAND
A perfect day for a stroll in the
market

As she takes his hand she notices a RING on his finger The
design is odd A SNAKE COILED AROUND THE GLOBE

ELENA
What an unusual ring I hadnt
noticed it before

ARMAND
(a touch evasive)
My family’s coat of arms

Something in his voice she can’t quite place Strolling on
they pass a HOMELESS PEASANT WOMAN under an archway her hat
in front of her Concerned Elena drops several coins in

HOMELESS PEASANT WOMAN
God bless you Sefiora

Elena offers a smile and as they walk on --

ARMAND
It seems your kindness hasn’t
wavered since our days in Spain

ELENA
Neither has your talent for
flattery but I’m not a schoolgirl
anymore

ARMAND
Are you saying I’1l have to try
harder to impress you

ELENA
You can start with dinner tonight
Say eight o’clock at your chateau

ARMAND
Why not your hacienda I’m anxious
to meet your son

ELENA
(beat how to play this)
-- Please try and understand
Darling He isn’t ready yet for
another man in my life

As if on cue ALEJANDRO’S HEAD POPS UP FROM A CART OF MELONS
BEHIND ARMAND Elena gasps in surprise --

ARMAND
What is it

He turns Alejandro’s head disappears To distract Armand
Elena grabs the first thing she can from a nearby stand a
flowery eyesore that barely passes for a HAT --

ELENA
Uh this hat Is breathtaking

ARMAND
Shall I purchase it for you

ELENA
On second thought who needs
another hat But I could use

Desperately looking around she sees a TOBACCONIST CART
across the marketplace and a CUSTOMER there lighting a PIPE -

ELENA
e a pipe

ARMAND
A pipe

ELENA

A pipe Yes like my father used
to smoke Tell me I haven’t
repulsed you with my un-ladylike
habit

ARMAND
On the contrary you fascinate me

ELENA
Look there’s a vendor --

ARMAND
I thought I might pick up an item
or two anyway Wait here won’t
you

He kisses her hand then goes Alejandro reappears

ELENA
What are you doing here

ALEJANDRO
Since when did you start smoking a
pipe

ELENA
I DON’T SMOKE A PIPE I said that
to get rid of him so I can get rid
of you

ALEJANDRO
Forgive me it’s just such a treat
to see you out among the peasants
I couldn’t resist the chance to
stop and say hello

ELENA
Please tell me that smell isn’t
coming from you

ALEJANDRO
Well it is That’s what you’ve
reduced me to -- I woke up this

morning with a pig are you happy

ELENA
Nonono I don’t want hear about
your flings --

ALEJANDRO
That’s not what I mean it was a
farm animal

ELENA
-- oh Dear God -

ALEJANDRO
It’s not what you think Elena
were just friends

ARMAND (0S)
« Elena

She SPINS Alejandro disappears Armand re-approaches

ELENA
Yes Darling

ARMAND
What color

ELENA
What color what

ARMAND
What color pipe

ELENA
(uh)
»e- Pink

ARMAND
A pink pipe Perfect

He goes She whirls Alejandro reappears --

ALEJANDRO
He’s so considerate

ELENA
Joaquin’s about to get out of
school -- it’s your turn to pick
him up Now go

ALEJANDRO
First tell me what you’re doing
with this guy Elena This isn’t
like you --

ELENA
How the hell would you know We
were apart so often maybe I
changed

ALEJANDRO
You didn’t --

ELENA
What makes you so sure

ALEJANDRO
After ten years of marriage you
think I can’t tell when you’re
hiding something

Elena’s frustrated he won’t quit So winding herself up

ELENA

Alright The truth I fell out of
love with you a long time ago

(she’s dying inside)
We were never meant to be together
Alejandro I’m with Armand now
Do you hear me Stay out of my
life

This is the most brutal rejection Alejandro could imagine

ELENA
(finally a whisper)
« Goodbye

Alejandro heartbroken watches her disappear into the crowd
WE FOLLOW ELENA as she ducks into an archway for privacy
tears now welling in her eyes The weight of her lie is like
a vice squeezing her heart After a beat a WOMAN’S VOICE

WOMAN’S VOICE
Are you alright My Child

Elena turns it’s the peasant woman she gave money to

ELENA
I‘ll be fine thank you

The woman touches Elena’s cheek and with the kindest smile

PEASANT WOMAN
Don’t be sad God is watching over
you

The woman goes Off Elena buoyed by a flash of hope

EXT MARKETPLACE CONTINUOUS 28

Alejandro heads out at his lowest point He BUMPS shoulders
with someone coming in

ALEJANDRO
Permisso --

MAN
(head low grumbling)
Watch it

As the man leaves Alejandro realizes IT’S JACOB McGIVENS
Alejandro’s eyes narrow Suspicious he follows

AT THE TOBACCONIST CART WITH ARMAND the vendor finishes
wrapping a PINK PIPE Armand looks up only to meet the eyes
of McGivens a few feet away McGivens gestures and moves
off Collecting the pipe Armand follows him into

EXT MARKETPLACE - ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS 29

Armand rounds a corner to find McGivens leaning against a
wall using a blade to SHARPEN HIS TEETH

ARMAND
I received your note I presume
you have what I want

MCGIVENS
Well now that depends on you

ARMAND
Make your meaning plain Mr
McGivens While you may feel at
home here among the sewer rats I
do not

McGivens pops in his teeth approaches a touch of menace

MCGIVENS
The Lord upholds the righteous but
His coffers are dry I believe
additional funds are imperative

ARMAND
I have yet to see the final deed I
require to complete our agreement

MCGIVENS
Cortez won’t sell

ARMAND
I need that land to connect the
track to the main line Mr
McGivens - you assured me your
tenure with the railroad gave you
experience in such matters

MCGIVENS
Case you ain’t noticed populating
Heavens become a Federal crime
Risk goes up So’s the price

ARMAND
Bring the deed to my chateau
tonight and you’1l be compensated
for your added risk Now go

MCGIVENS
(tips his hat a grin)
Oh and uh ‘fore you swing into
that fancy saddle of yours might
wanna clean off your boots

As he goes Armand looks down to realize he’s stepped in
HORSE SHIT Cursing he snaps out a hankie and moves off --
doesn’t see A SHADOWED FIGURE under an archway ALEJANDRO
He steps into the light eyes burning --

INT MISSION SANTA LUCIA - DAY 30

The doors BURST open as Alejandro enters urgently -- Felipe
at the altar spins around

ALEJANDRO
It’s time for confession

Felipe smiles Leads Alejandro to the confessionals The
last one’s ROPED OFF A sign reads “UNDER RESTORATION”
Felipe pulls the curtain back Alejandro hesitates --

ALEJANDRO
Joaquin’s waiting for me at school

FRAY FELIPE
I‘1l bring him home --

GO --

INT CONFESSIONAL - CONTINUOUS 31

Alejandro enters quickly closes the curtain behind him
crosses himself then TRIGGERS A LEVER the back of the
confessional SWINGS OPEN revealing a SECRET CHAMBER Hanging
on the wall is THE ZORRO OUTFIT The door closes behind
Alejandro leaving no trace of its existence

INT SECRET CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 32

From a niche in the cobblestone wall Alejandro opens a
WOODEN BOX revealing A STASH OF THREE BLACK MASKS

MUSIC BUILDS over a succession of fast iconic images

Alejandro turns into view WEARING THE MASK - the gloves go
on -- the cape WHIPS onto shoulders - the SWORD is sheathed

INT SECRET STABLE BENEATH THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 33

SADDLE Up ahead the entrance to a DESERTED ALLEYWAY It’s
halfway boarded up by planks A sign warns trespassers

DANGER CONDEMNED ZORRO AND TORNADO LEAP OVER THE TOP
PLANK surging down the alley --

EXT DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY 34

Pounding hooves the black flowing mane and cape Zorro rides
hell-for-leather across the desert eyes blazing --

EXT THE CORTEZ RANCHO — DAY 35

On the back porch of a small clapboard dwelling Blanca
Cortez washes clothes She glances across the property to a
BARN sees her husband hard at work inside

IN THE BARN like a blacksmith’s forge where Cortez builds
his miners’ tools to sell at the market He hammers away
red hot metal glowing against a hearth Pausing to wipe his
brow he catches his wife’s smile through the barn doors

Blanca finishes wringing out clothes moves through the house
to pin them to the clothesline out front but when she opens

the door JAKE McGIVENS IS RIGHT THERE WITH HIS HORRIBLE

GRIN As he cups her mouth we go back to
Cortez in the forge -- when a voice stops him cold

MCGIVENS (0S)
CORTEZ

Cortez races from the barn to find McGivens clutching Blanca
a BOWIE KNIFE to her throat his posse surrounding them

MCGIVENS
‘And the Lord shall expel them
before you and ye shall possess
their land’

CORTEZ
Please don’t hurt her

MCGIVENS
Gimme the deed

McGivens snaps for the deed eyes gleaming cruelly Cortez
RUNS into the house -- hurls open a chest at the foot
rummages desperately -- where’s the deed -- finally he
finds it races back outside

MCGIVENS
Bring it here

CORTEZ
Let her go

McGivens HURLS Blanca to the dirt As Cortez picks her up
McGivens and his posse take aim at the helpless couple --

MCGIVENS
(re his pistols)
‘Salvation’ and ‘Damnation’
got one thing in common You gotta
die to find either one

ZORRO (V0O)
How true

McGivens suddenly feels a SWORD POINT at the back of his
neck He stiffens

ZORRO
Drop your guns All of you

In angry surprise McGivens nods to his men and they
reluctantly throw their guns to the dirt

ZORRO
(to Cortez and Blanca)
Get in the house

They race off Zorro pushes McGivens forward by the sword
tip SNIFFING the air he winces

ZORRO
Cleanliness is next to Godliness --

And he knocks McGivens into a WATER TROUGH Zorro LEAPS over
an adobe wall McGivens SPLASHING and HOWLING at his men to
follow -- three of them snatch up their guns and hop over the
wall landing in an ENCLOSURE filled with PIGS AND CHICKENS
The animals scatter mud flying Zorro zig-zagging to create
a harder target as the men FIRE but they’re quickly OUT OF
BULLETS -- Zorro draws his sword and ATTACKS as

McGivens leads three men to the porch of the Cortez house
nods to one to kick the door down Just before the guy does
a SHOTGUN BLAST rips through it HURTLING him off the porch
McGivens and his remaining men duck for cover behind the
trough FIRING BACK RUTHLESSLY at the house which

as he propels Blanca toward a HATCH in the floor
CORTEZ

Don’t let them hurt you --

She lowers herself into the CRAWLSPACE beneath the house —-

open the barrel of his shotgun and loads two more shells --

behind his back)

Youre always going out

Sweetheart I wouldn’t if I didn’t
have to

JOAQUIN
Why do you have to

ELENA
Because I promised a friend

JOAQUIN
What friend

He stares suspiciously She forces a weak smile and as she
begins to spin her lie we realize who she’s talking about

ELENA

A woman I met her the other day
She has a daughter Whom she
loves more than anything in the
world

(eyes glistening)
But this womans been forced to
keep a secret and it’s breaking
her heart because a mother
should never have to lie to her
child

« What’s her secret

And she wants so desperately to tell him but

She told me she would only speak of
it when the time was right

The Colonel was about to leave

ELENA
Not on my account I hope

Nothing would please me more than
the pleasure of your company My
Dear but I have other pressing
matters to tend to

ELENA
I’m sorry Marie I don’t smoke

Armand pauses confused as Marie opens the box revealing the
PINK PIPE he bought at the market Elena quickly covers

ELENA
-- unless it’s my pipe You
remembered how thoughtful
(slips it in her pocket)
Though I should let my stomach
settle first

ARMAND

Just as well I’ve been waiting all
night to tell you something

(beat)
Elena when I first saw you at the
academy the other boys said you
were the most beautiful woman on
the Iberian continent They called
you ‘La Flor De Andalusia’ and I
thought of everything in the world
I might ever know or have it would
never be someone as stunning as
you yet here you are

terribly lost Would you show me
back to the dining room please

ELENA
Thank you so much I can see how
indispensable you are to Armand

FERROQ

I am his devoted servant And
would give my life to protect him
from any man -- or woman who
seeks to betray him

And just when we think he has her number she switches
tactics Stops leans in so she barely has to murmur

ELENA
Perhaps it hasn’t occurred to you I
may soon be the lady of this house
So start exercising some respect
when you talk to me or I’ll have
your balls filleted with a side of
truffles

Zorro pops out of the chimney Goes straight for Armand’s
desk searching for some kind of clue Opens drawers
nothing -- checks the bookshelves behind paintings but
keeps coming up empty-handed Then he notices

A MIRROR on the wall hanging slightly askew -- hinging
outward like a door Alejandro moves closer touches the
mirror at its corner it SWINGS OPEN revealing

A MAP OF AMERICA JZorro’s eyes play across it Armand’s
traced the trajectory of America’s rail lines -- most
importantly he’s outlined the path of a train track from

California’s central line right to his vineyard

ZORRO

He‘s building a track to the
vineyard

McGivens -- but Zorro is gone

notices something McGivens has left his Henry Repeater

CONCEALED ROPE pulling the trigger on the Henry Repeater

which Zorro’s set into position between two rocks -- the
blast SEVERS THE EMERGENCY CABLE holding the platform in
place and it comes CRASHING DOWN ON THE REST OF THE SHIPMENT

McGivens and his men HURL themselves out of the way but two
aren‘t so lucky and get CRUSHED As McGivens pulls himself
up from the sand he hears a WHINNY and looks up to see

ZORRO BACK ON THE CLIFF He raises his hat then
disappears Off McGivens eyes glaring death

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE BLUFFS - DAY 76

Joaquin sits beneath a tree wincing at a SMALL CUT on his
arm Tornado stands vigil beside him

ZORRO‘S VOICE
Let me see that arm

Joaquin WHIRLS to see Zorro who flips open a pouch on
Tornado’s saddle places the bottle of wine inside and
removes bandaging gauze

JOAQUIN
(thrilled stammering)
I can’t believe it’s you You‘re
really Zorro I mean whoa And
Tornado Man he’s huge

ZORRO
(dressing the wound)
Hold still Joaquin --

That freezes Alejandro

JOAQUIN
You know my name Zorro knows my
name How do you know my name

ZORRO
I uh well I know your father

JOAQUIN
You know my dad

ZORRO
(beat improvising)
I asked him to keep my secret And
now I’m asking you to do the same
no one can ever know you saw me
(beat)
Especially not your mother

JOAQUIN
ee Why

ALEJANDRO
Hey I’m the one asking the
questions Now why aren’t you at
school What are you doing here

JOAQUIN
The guy with the scar on his face
I knew he was up to something You
really showed that sonofa-

ZORRO
Watch your mouth eh This isn’t a
game your father’d have a heart
attack if he saw what happened
here

JOAQUIN
No he wouldn‘t he didn’t even
remember to pick me up at school
yesterday

guilt in his eyes

He pauses

ZORRO
He didn’t forget Joaquin what
you have to understand is--

His son is staring up at him waiting so

Even behind the mask we see the

desperately for an answer and finally with resignation

ZORRO
« you don’t have to understand
anything He should’ve been there
(beat)
And I know he feels terrible For
all the moments in your life he’s
missed

Joaquin senses deep emotion welling up in Zorro Weird

JOAQUIN
He told you all that

ALEJANDRO
(beat then)
I’m getting to know him better
everyday

He smiles and finishes bandaging his son‘’s wound

EXT ALVARADO ACADEMY FOR CHILDREN DAY 77

Father Quintero is COUNTING HEADS as the children file off
the wagons and back into school PULL BACK to a nearby
alleyway where Zorro and Joaquin are watching

Hurry before your teacher knows
you’re gone

Joaquin starts off Stops Turns --

JOAQUIN
eee Zorro
(this isn’t easy for him)
Next time you talk to my dad maybe
you could tell him that I

Alejandro waits with baited breath Joaquin wants to finish
the sentence with ‘ love him’ but can’t say the words

JOAQUIN
-- Nothin’

A flicker of disappointment in Zorro’s eyes but he manages a
smile A last look from Joaquin and as he turns to go --

ZORRO
Keep your chin up eh

That stops Joaquin cold ose are e same words his fa

gaid to him in the carriage

He turns back but ZORRO’S GONE After a beat Joaquin runs

on discreetly taking the last place in line as Father
Quintero finishes his head count

INT MISSION SANTA LUCIA - DAY

CLOSE on the bottle of wine Zorro just stole Felipe runs a

finger over the label with excitement

FRAY FELIPE
It’s a Lafite 1791 very rare --

Alejandro enters frame pacing a burning in his belly

ALEJANDRO
It doesn‘t make sense I thought
the shipment would explain
everything

Felipe pours the wine into a silver ritual cup raises it
CHRIST ON THE CROSS hanging above the altar --

FRAY FELIPE
Bless you for turning water into
wine -

ALEJANDRO
Hes building a track to connect
his vineyard to the railroad --

why

FRAY FELIPE
(takes a sip then)
Ahh effervescent yet tenacious

Alejandro stops turns Eyes wide --

ALEJANDRO
Wait a minute those are the same
ridiculous words you said at the
party
(he grabs the cup sips)
It‘s the same wine

FRAY FELIPE
The one the count passed off as his
own vintage
(staring at each other)
If he’s not making wine in the
vineyard what’s he doing

to

ALEJANDRO
(mind whirling)
There was a marking -- a symbol -
branded on the crates from the
ship a serpent coiled around the
globe

CLOSE FELIPE That ringing a distant bell in his mind --

FRAY FELIPE
A serpent coiled around the
globe
(then moving off quickly)
Come with me --

INT MISSION SANTA LUCIA - CHURCH ARCHIVES - MINUTES LATER 79

An ANCIENT BOOK is dropped onto a table kicking up DUST
Alejandro lowers his candle to read the title “ENEMIES OF
THE CHURCH” Felipe flips it open turning pages -- then
finds the SNAKE AND GLOBE symbol he’s looking for

FRAY FELIPE
I haven’t read this since my
seminary training
(taps the page)
--- is this it

ALEJANDRO
(it is)
-- ‘Orbis Unum’

FRAY FELIPE
Latin It means ‘One World’
It represents the Order Of The
Teutonic Knights an ancient
brotherhood of noblemen who ruled
over Europe in secrecy after the
crusades

ALEJANDRO
Waiwait Armand is a knight

FRAY FELIPE
According to legend they began as
protectors of the church and all
its riches but greed twisted
them into barbarous men The Pope
was forced to order their
extermination and all of Europe
became a battleground choked with
horror

Felipe sifts through pages we move in and out of CLOSE-UPS
as they study the ILLUSTRATIONS

FRAY FELIPE

It’s said a handful of knights
escaped with enough wealth to start
over this time in secret Some
believe they are the masters behind
all the kingdoms of Europe even
today

(beat reading)
Here it speaks of a prophecy
written when they went into
hiding listen ‘There shall be
in the west a land of great power
that will rise to threaten the
serpent only by turning the
power on itself will the serpent
survive’

They look up at each other

FRAY FELIPE
A land in the west

ALEJANDRO
(grave whisper)
America they want to destroy it

And off that we PRELAP A SEARING ARIA --

INT SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - AFTERNOON 80

Matinee a DIVA belts out the aria in a bravura voice ELENA
AND ARMAND are watching from a private box He takes her
hand She accepts looking drawn a million miles away A
beat then Ferrog enters urgent Whispers in Armand’s ear
His face goes taut Forcing a smile he whispers to Elena

ARMAND
Forgive me Darling I won’t be a
moment

He exits Elena turns alert wondering what’s happening --

INT OPERA HOUSE - THE BAR CONTINUOUS 81

Armand and Ferrog enter the elaborate bar to find McGivens
waiting with a shit-eating grin He strikes a MATCH
igniting a shot of WHISKEY

MCGIVENS
I do enjoy an occasional dance with
the devil

And without blowing out the flaming shot he throws it back

ARMAND
This better be damned important

MCGIVENS
You’re the one who’s damned Sly
Boots Zorro destroyed your
shipment

McGivens pours another shot strikes another match Armand’s
hand lashes out fingers extinguishing the match --

ARMAND
I increase your payment and this is
the news you bring me

MCGIVENS
Open your eyes Zorro got there
ahead of us means one of your
people’s talking

That registers but Armand keeps his reaction contained

ARMAND
The Hacienda can’t front as a
vineyard if it isn’t producing
wine

MCGIVENS
Maybe you oughtta reconsider
puttin’ together a fox hunt

ARMAND
Do it -- and when you find this
Zorro take his head Nothing can
stop the train from departing at
dawn now get out

Their eyes hold then Mcgivens exits Armand says to Ferroq
ARMAND
If someone’s talking find the man
responsible

FERROQ
Master what if it’s a woman

We go TIGHT ON ARMAND anger mounting in his look

ARMAND
I’ll forgive the inference because
your service to my family has
earned you the right to speak
freely

With that Armand exits HOLD on Ferrog’s evil eyes -- more
determined now than ever to prove his suspicions correct

INT SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - ARMAND’S BOX - CONTINUOUS 82

Elena watches the opera A FIGURE enters silently through
the curtain behind her Lowers a WHISPER

ALEJANDRO
Don’t turn around Don’t say
anything Just listen

Elena‘s heart quickens Though she’s in shadow there are
people in the boxes around her She can’t make a scene
Alejandro leans closer in her ear

ALEJANDRO

I’ve been trying to convince you
Armand’s not the man he appears to
be but you already know that
You’ve always been able to see
people for who they are even me

(beat)
Whatever he’s making in that
vineyard it isnt wine and I’m
going to find out what it is

ELENA
(urgently)
I’m begging you Alejandro don’t--

ALEJANDRO
What are you involved in Tell me--

ELENA
You have to trust me--

ALEJANDRO
(struggling)
Then answer me one question the
other day you said we were never
meant to be together in your
heart do you really believe that

A swell of APPLAUSE breaks the moment as the curtain drops
signalling intermission -

ELENA
Armand‘s coming back GO

Torn his question unanswered Alejandro pushes quickly
through the curtain and

THE IMAGE CHANGES SUDDENLY we’re watching Alejandro as he
leaves Elena in her box as seen through OPERA GLASSES
Across the opera house HARRIGAN lowers the opera glasses
He swivels to PIKE Quickly they rise and EXIT --

Alejandro pushes through the crowd with a full head of steam
rounds a corner BUMPING into Armand and Ferrog --

ARMAND
Don De La Vega --

ALEJANDRO
- Count Armand --

ARMAND
(anger building)
Your repeated appearances are
bordering on harassment

ALEJANDRO
Forgive me I came to say goodbye
to Elena Try as I have to win her
back she loves you I wish you
both happiness

He GOES leaving Armand a little puzzled still dubious

EXT SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84

Alejandro bounds down the steps A man is headed up toward
him indistinctly part of the crowd - it’s Harrigan

We go to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a RING on his finger he
flicks open the GEM revealing a TINY NEEDLE “Accidentally”
bumping into Alejandro he injects the needle into his wrist
a pierce so small Alejandro doesn’t notice

HARRIGAN
-- Excuse me --

And he’s gone Alejandro hails a Hansom Carriage

ALEJANDRO
Mission Santa Lucia hurry --

IE HANSOM CAB - MOVING - CONTINUOUS 85

Alejandro settles into the back seat as the coach rides off
Quickly he begins to GROW WOOZY fights it but his eyes
flutter finally he PASSES OUT COLD

And we BOOM UP out the window to reveal PIKE at the reins

EXT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - DUSK 86

Armand’s carriage arrives at the hacienda Ferroq reining the
horses Armand steps out offering a hand to Elena

ELENA
I had a wonderful time Thank you

ARMAND
I saw Alejandro leaving the opera
house Elena If I were a less
trusting man I might think you
still have feelings for him

ELENAS FACE drastic times call for drastic measures So

ELENA
I told him something I haven’t told
you yet
(a smile though it kills
her)
I want to be your wife Armand

And despite his mistrust the dilemma he’s been struggling
with seems to evaporate Taking Elena in his arms he KISSES
HER passionately FERROQ watches through icy eyes

ARMAND
You have my heart without
expectations It is and always
will be yours Elena

ELENA

After I put Joaquin to bed perhaps
we could have supper at your
Hacienda If I’m going to be the
lady of the house I want to start
making myself at home

(Armand hesitates)
-- What is it

ARMAND
Some colleagues of mine will be
arriving from Europe this evening
Our meeting may run late

ELENA
A late supper then I could stay
the night

He tries to contain his lust just as she contains the fact
that she wont be following through with the sex He kisses
her one last time and as she heads into the house

ARMAND
Elena well have the world you
and I

She smiles but that creeps her the hell out As Armand

climbs back in the carriage Elena hurries inside and we
BOOM UP TO REVEAL

JOAQUIN leaning over the veranda stunned beyond words -- not

only is his mother seeing another man she’s gonna marry him

Off his heartbreak

The drug will wear off soon Mr De
La Vega

HARRIGAN

Or would you prefer Zorro

PIKE
The day California was voted into
the union We followed you to the
viaduct

I believe this belongs to you
Alejandro’s mind is spinning --

ALEJANDRO
« who are you

And shockingly Pike pulls out A BADGE

PIKE

Harrigan We’re The Pinkertons
operatives of the United States
government

ALEJANDRO

HARRIGAN
You could say we’re a kind of
Secret service

PIKE
We’re living in perilous times Mr
De La Vega Americas gates have
swung wide open

HARRIGAN
Trouble is it’s getting harder to
tell a genuine American from the
man who’s just pretending to be

PIKE
Which is why on occasion we
require certain individuals to aid
in our country’s defense people
like your ex-wife

ALEJANDRO
(stunned)
Elena works for you As a spy

HARRIGAN
We needed someone who could gain
his trust

PIKE
And who more suited to the task
than the woman he could never
forget

HARRIGAN
You see before The Count’s arrival
here we intercepted a telegram he
dispatched to his associates
throughout Europe

PIKE
In that telegram he claimed he was
on the verge of producing a new
weapon

HARRIGAN
A weapon that would bring about
mass destruction

PIKE
With a single target in mind

HARRIGAN PIKE
The United States of America The United States of America

ALEJANDRO
(trying to add that up)
What kind of weapon would do that

PIKE
Your ex-wife may be on the verge of
answering that very question

HARRIGAN
And every time you interfere you
jeopardize her cover Understand

ALEJANDRO
(anger rising)
The divorce was your idea wasn’t
it So Elena would be free to lure
in the count you forced i
this

PIKE
We prefer to think of it as a
mutual understanding in exchange
for her help we promised to keep
the true name of Zorro secret from
his enemies

HARRIGAN
A name you share with your wife
andgson

A long beat Alejandros eyes glaring rage His look quickly
turns to defeat his head drops and after a beat

ALEJANDRO
--- I know something that might
help you

He gestures to them come closer In tandem they do -- and
that’s when Alejandro grabs them by the collars and SLAMS
THEIR HEADS AGAINST THE BARS LOCKING THEM THERE --

ALEJANDRO
YOU DESTROYED MY FAMILY YOU
SONSOFBITCHES

He SLAMS them against the bars again then HURLS them back
They tumble to the floor Harrigan spitting blood Pike
straightening his tie - slowly they rise seething

HARRIGAN
Our country must be protected De
La Vega without apology

ALEJANDRO
By blackmailing your own people
You call that a democracy

PIKE
When national security’s at stake
we can’t afford to be Democratic

This belongs in a museum Now sit
there Bleed And think about it

are lead by a guard past SIX MASSIVE (but empty) WINE VATS
lined with MAINTENANCE LADDERS The ladders connect over the
top of the vats forming a criss-crossing network

The men are brought to a wall of STACKED BARRELS -- the guard
touches one at its center and THE BARRELS SWING OPEN a
secret door The men pass through the guard remaining
behind as the ‘door’ closes

Elena scans for the other guards there are two stationed by
the main entrance one more guarding the coaches outside
She ducks into shadow

The guard by the barrels hears a ‘psst’ Brow furrowed he
moves around the nearest vat from the darkness Elena
SMASHES HIM IN THE FACE with a wooden paddle He tumbles
back CRASHING against a stack of metal buckets

The NOISE alerts the other guards -- they fan out -- two of
them find their unconscious comrade and look around
bewildered --

ANGLE UP TO REVEAL ELENA on top of the vats holding the
downed guard’s PISTOL and SWORD As she turns she’s
CONFRONTED by the third guard on the ladder behind her his
gun raised -

-- drop it --

A moment of defeat Elena begins to lower the gun then
PULLS THE TRIGGER shattering the ladder the guard’s standing
on -- he PLUNGES into the empty vat as the guards below LOOK
UP and SEE Elena racing along the ladders

Climbing to BLOCK HER OFF at both ends they attack a
furious swordfight on the ladders Elena matching them blow-
for-blow -- they drive her toward the EDGE and she jumps
SLIDING down a pipe to the floor In so doing she LOSES HER

SWORD And the guards are THERE moving in for the kill

Until a WHISTLE snaps them around Zorro He winks they
CHARGE -- but he turns and runs Leading them out the
entrance he JUMPS on TORNADO whose hooves SPRING OUT -- the
guards are HURTLED BACK where they land unconscious at
Elenas feet

Alejandro moves to embrace her but she reaches out to stop
him --

Alejandro and Elena REACT ARMAND begins circling the table

ARMAND

This country has one glaring
weakness its people are divided by
north and south Talk of a civil
war is far more dire than anyone
truly knows It is inevitable
Gentlemen The only question is
who will claim victory

(beat)
We will answer that by employing
the newest weapon of the modern
age a compound thirteen times more
powerful than gunpowder

He opens a SMALL BOX On an inset of velvet is a VIAL filled
with CLEAR LIQUID Armand holds it like an egg

ARMAND
Nitroglycerin For months
this vineyard has been a cover for
its manufacturing

The knights lean in amazed Armand gestures --

ARMAND

With the help of our Confederate
ally Colonel Beauregard we’ll
begin regular shipments to the
Southern army -- assuring their
victory America won’t stand a
chance in hell -- and I do mean
hell -- of remaining united

(beat)
The end result Gentlemen is this
the Central Banks of Austria and
Hungary will take possession of the
country’s foreclosures Baron
Leopold you’1ll regain control of
the steel market you lost to
Pennsylvania while Arch Duke
Wilhelm will reacquire New
England’s shipping lanes

APPLAUSE except for one of the knights -- LORD DILLINGHAM a
British face meticulously sculpted beard

LORD DILLINGHAM
And what do you gain from this
count

ARMAND
Why the most valuable commodity of
all ten percent off the top

LAUGHTER but Dillingham appears grave He rises

LORD DILLINGHAM
Brothers you know my spirit is
with you but we risk antagonizing
a sleeping giant if we fail Ill
see myself out

Dillingham heads off Armand looks defeated then HURLS
THE VIAL AT DILLINGHAM BLOWING HIM TO SMITHEREENS
Alejandro and Elena DUCK as smoke roils through the bars
overhead The knights stare wide-eyed as the smoke
clears

ARMAND
Any further objections Good
now if you’d be kind enough to
follow me

He triggers a lever and the CREST on the floor ROTATES
revealing a SPIRALLING STAIRCASE leading underground As the
knights disappear down the stairs Alejandro and Elena watch
-- hushed whispering

ALEJANDRO
You know your boyfriend’s a little
psychotic
ELENA
Stop calling him my boyfriend
ALEJANDRO
Then why are you still wearing his
necklace
ELENA

I‘m undercover
(then simply)
Besides these are black pearls

ALEJANDRO
I was there remember A little
flashy jewelry and you threw
yourself at him like a baboon in
heat --

ELENA
You’re unbelievable I was trying
to keep him from seeing you

ALEJANDRO
Don’t turn this around I was there
to help --

ELENA

With help like that I’1l end up
having three kids with him

They’re so engrossed in their banter only now do they
realize the crest is rotating back into place They exchange
an ‘oh shit’ glance then race out from behind the door and
slip through the hole just as it closes

INT MISSION SANTA LUCIA - NIGHT 104
Felipe and Joaquin kneel by the votive candles Lights one

FRAY FELIPE
Kneel beside me Joaquin Let us
pray for the safety of your mother
and father

A sudden gust of wind EXTINGUISHES the candles JAKE
McGIVENS steps into the light with that awful toothy grin
His men fan out Felipe keeps Joaquin close --

FRAY FELIPE
Unless you‘ve come to confess you
have no business here

MCGIVENS
Funny you should mention
confession Padre since you’re
obliged to keep the secrets of your
flock maybe you can help me put a

name to a face -- more
particularly to a mask
(beat)

Who is Zorro
Their eye contact holds and holds
FRAY FELIPE

You know Zorro he could be
anyone at all

McGivens approaches fingering the CRUCIFIX NECKLACE around
Felipe’s neck - then reaches inside his own coat we
presume for a weapon To our surprise he pulls out his OWN
CRUCIFIX NECKLACE

MCGIVENS
See now Padre We’re both men of
God you can tell me

POSSE MEMBER
Hey Boss -—-

McGivens turns One of his men has found the BOTTLE OF WINE
on the altar that Zorro stole McGivens turns to Felipe

MCGIVENS
The Lord hates a liar

FRAY FELIPE
» Alright I’11 tell you

AND IN A SURPRISE MOVE HE UPENDS A CANDELABRA AND SMASHES IT
AGAINST McGIVENS’ HEAD -- Felipe SHOUTS to Joaquin

FRAY FELIPE
RUN

Joaquin BOLTS for the door as Felipe SWINGS the candelabra at

two of the men knocking them back -- he’s one hell of a
fighter -- he spins -- AND BANG

Felipe freezes eyes wide staring at the barrel of McGIVENS’
SMOKING GUN His look tracks down to a HOLE in his frock

FRAY FELIPE
Oh God

He falls to his knees Joaquin SKIDS to a stop and SCREAMS

JOAQUIN
FELIPEYOUKILLEDFELIPE

MCGIVENS
Shut him up and put him in the
wagon

A HAND is cupped over Joaquin’s mouth as he’s dragged off
McGivens stares at the dead padre on the floor then up at
THE CROSS hanging above the altar Quickly he exits

INT MANUFACTORY - NIGHT 105

Torchlight precedes Armand as he leads the knights to the
bottom of the spiralling staircase

ARMAND
Behold my brothers I give you
the future
As we PULL BACK for the REVEAL A19TH CENTURY MUNITIONS

FACTORY Through SWIRLING STEAM armed guards monitor
WORKERS in saucer hats as they siphon NITRO into a steam-
powered assembly line of BOTTLES The bottles are sealed and
packed into CRATES The crates are then loaded onto a
ROLLING FLATBED which is pushed down the length of

A SIX ¢ IONS TRAIN

As Armand leads the knights deeper into the factory Elena
and Alejandro APPEAR at the entrance taking cover behind
crates filled with EMPTY BOTTLES A WORKER heads toward
them As he reaches for a crate we go

CLOSE ON HIS FACE as he suddenly WINCES in pain falling to
his knees -- a look familiar to a man who’s just been kicked
in the balls which in fact he has As he DROPS from
frame his SAUCER HAT STAYS IN PLACE balanced on the edges
of two crates A beat then ZORRO’S FACE rises into frame
the hat now on his head

ANOTHER ANGLE - MOVING with Armand and the knights as he
leads them through the factory

ARMAND
These tracks have been connected to
California‘s main line allowing
for a continuous supply of nitro to
the southern battlefront Although
I’1l be returning to Europe
shortly Ferrog will remain to
oversee the operation

He stops a PASSING WORKER carrying a crate -- pulls out an
EMPTY BOTTLE to explain

ARMAND
The nitro’s been concealed within
these bottles to circumvent any
prying northern patrols

ARCHDUKE WILHEM
God help them if they want a
taste

Laughter from the men Armand puts the bottle back in the
crate As the worker moves off we glimpse his FACE under
the hat IT’S ZORRO FERROQ approaches Armand concerned --

FERROQ
An urgent matter requires your
attention at the Hacienda Master

ARMAND
-- Gentlemen the colonel will
lead you through the rest of the
facility If youll excuse me

He follows Ferrog out through the archway PASSING ELENA as
she crouches low behind the crates Zorro returns urgently --

ALEJANDRO
He’s going back to the Hacienda --

ELENA
(urgent panic)
I have to get back before he does --

ALEJANDRO
Go I‘1l keep the train from
leaving --

ELENA

es Te amo

ALEJANDRO
Siempre

They kiss fiercely then separate Alejandro’s heart aches
watching her go then he turns back to the train a new
determination in his eyes

EXT VINEYARD - NIGHT 106

Elena emerges sees ARMAND’S CARRIAGE heading toward the
Hacienda She BOLTS through the vineyard after it --

INT THE MANUFACTORY — NIGHT 107

Colonel Beauregard leads the knights along They watch as
the crates are lifted from the rolling flatbed and carried
into the cargo car where they’re placed on SUSPENDED
PLATFORMS rigged to PNEUMATIC PIPES

COLONEL BEAUREGARD
As you can see The Count’s
retrofitted the carriage to insure
the nitro won’t detonate
prematurely

As they move on we HOLD on the flatbed as a worker pushes it
off revealing ZORRO LYING THERE ON THE TRACK (he was
hiding beneath the flatbed) Unnoticed he hops into

INT NITRO CAR EXT TRACKS BENEATH CAR - CONTINUOUS 108

Very carefully he pries open a crate and removes a BOTTLE
FILLED WITH NITRO Grabbing a roll of FUSE CORD he opens a
MAINTENANCE DOOR on the floor of the car and slips down

ONTO THE TRACK BENEATH THE CARGO CAR Crawling along he
makes his way toward the locomotive with the bottle and cord
A BLAST OF STEAM EXPLODES INCHES FROM HIS FACE -- he nearly
DROPS the bottle - close call -- moving on he DUCKS into
shadow as a BURLY WOOD STOKER loads wood into the furnace

And Zorro builds a timebomb slinging one end of the fuse
cord over a pipe then tying it around the tip of the bottle
Carefully letting go THE BOTTLE HANGS THERE The idea is
this once the cord dissolves away the bottle will FALL and
EXPLODE Moving fast down the train tunnel Zorro unspools
the fuse to ignite the cord from a safe distance

EXT VINEYARD THE GRAPE VINES - CONTINUOUS 109

Elena RUNS through the vines In a moment of frenzy she
TRIPS Picking herself up she’s struck by A LOW GROWL --

tearing after her --

He gestures a hand to the dogs at the window They WHIMPER

Marie places a silver tray in front of Elena and lifts off
the dome revealing we presume QUAIL Now Elena notices

oddly he hasn’t been given anything to eat

ELENA
Thank you Marie

Marie glares then goes Armand too stares at Elena with
grim resolve She begins cutting her food feeling tense

ELENA
Aren’t you hungry

ARMAND
Have I ever told you the story of
how my parents fell in love

ELENA
-- Not that I recall

ARMAND
My father was a soldier in the
Peninsular Campaigns When he was
sent to capture Lisbon he became
enamored of a local maiden who
of course wanted nothing to do
with a conquering soldier So my
father took her to his estate
and locked her in a room

(low menacing)

For three years And when my
father finally let my mother out
she was desperate to accept his
hand in marriage

ELENA
(nervous taking a bite)
- How romantic

ARMAND
Tasty is it

ELENA
It’s unusual Is it quail

ARMAND

FLINGS it open to find

PINKERTON AGENTS Ferrogq CLAMPS a fist around Elena’s neck

and PINS HER to the wall Armand approaches acidic

ARMAND
I was told there was a traitor in
my own home but I didn’t want to
believe it was you you’ve broken
my heart Elena

He RIPS the pearl necklace from her throat the pearls flying
apart Elena glares at him eyes full of hate

ELENA
Did you actually think I’d be swept
off my feet by a sadistic coward
like you

ARMAND
I thought you were a woman of
vision

ELENA
I can barely stomach the sight of
you Armand The only way I could
stand your touch was by imagining
you were Alejandro

That has its intended effect stabbing his heart But he has
made another connection

ARMAND
Yes Alejandro your peasant
husband Tell me when you
fantasized about him did you
imagine him wearing a mask

Elena‘s face goes COLD with fear Then the sound of SOMEONE
COMING from around the corner -- McGIVENS DRAGS JOAQUIN INTO

arms around his mother she PULLS HIM CLOSE for dear life

MCGIVENS

run into the Stoker’s POOL OF PEE

Zorro ATTACKS with renewed vigor - the Stoker grabs a TORCH

his hand - it lands RE-IGNITING THE GODD FUSE

In T CTORY Armand stops to confer with Beauregard

DIVING FOR THE FUSE AS IT REACHES THE HANGING BOTTLE -- AND

IN SLOW MOTION THE BOTTLE DROPS -- FALLING TOWARD THE GROUND
