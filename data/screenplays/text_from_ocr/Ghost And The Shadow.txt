OVER CREDITS

EXT EAST CHINA SEA - NIGHT

The calm surface suddenly marred by air bubbles
Building to a hellish boil and WHOOOSH --

An ancient shipwreck surfaces on giant ‘air pillows’

PAN TO a modern salvaging ship and deep in the horizon the
neon skyline of Hong Kong

EXT RECOVERY SHIP DECK - NIGHT

The wreck sits there like some prehistoric beast Workers
recover artifacts crusted with time laying them out

ANGLE ON - A LARGE METAL CHEST

A HISS of vacuum as the lid is pried off and a FAT STONE
BUDDHA grins up at us

LATER

On its side the Buddha is being cut open A gloved hand
reaches inside a cavity to find AN ANCIENT ENVELOPE

An almost religious awe grips on the Archeologist holding it

INT RECOVERY SHIP CABIN - DAY

A Chinese Gangster opens a briefcase full of cash and is
given the envelope in return Grins and a handshake before
the Gangster calmly pulls a gun and shoots the Archeologist

He puts the envelope in the briefcase and heads out

EXT RECOVER SHIP - DAY

The Chinese Gangster departs on a motorboat leaving behind a
ship-full of bodies in twisted repose

EXT SKY - DAY

Soaring birds flee as a hulking A380 appears and lands in
the heat-shimmer of Paris’ Charles De Gaulle airport
INT CHARLES DE GAULLE ARRIVALS TERMINAL - DAY

The Chinese Gangster knocks THREE TIMES on the door to the
‘FAMILY BATHROOM’ It’s opened from the inside He enters

INT FAMILY BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A Big Frenchman tosses the Chinese Gangster a pouch full of

diamonds in return for the envelope Both nod - deal done -
then the Frenchman unloads a silenced 9mm into the Gangster

The Chinese Gangster is knocked back and sags on the toilet

The Frenchman departs hanging a “CLOSED” sign on the door

INT CHARLES DE GAULLE ARRIVALS TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

The jovial Frenchman heads out when there is SCREAMING behind
him He turns catching two slugs in the chest from the
Chinese Gangster staggering after him leaking blood

The Frenchman goes down crawling The Chinese Gangster
buckles firing wildly as he dies

Pandemonium Gendarmes come running The Frenchman flops
onto his back and the world FLARES OUT

INT LONG ISLAND GARAGE - DAY

The stinging glare of a hi-arc plasma cutter burning through
steel PULL BACK to reveal --

BOB “THE SHADOW” EAVES in welding goggles and we
reveal it’s not a car he’s working on but an impressive
Diebold safe He sings along to The Stones’ “Shattered” on
a radio

SHADOW
Dont you know the crime rates

going up up up up UP
He swigs a little Pabst Blue Ribbon Grabs a sledgehammer
SHADOW (CONTD)
To live in this town you must be

tough tough tough tough

Lays into the safe Sweat flies The damn thing finally
yields and he does a little Mick jig
SHADOW (CONTD)
Go ahead bite the big apple

He throws the safe door open and freezes

SHADOW (CONT’D)
(Low)
Dont mind the maggots

THE SAFE

Full of old VHS porn It must be some kind of trick He
goes through the tapes Wax My Ass Jurassic Pork Debbie
Does Dallas and no it’s just stale porn

Shadow sags dirty sweating Some off-screen throat
clearing makes him whirl

A Huge blonde man who looks like he could shit a Hummer
stands there We’ll call him RUTGER (30s) A beat then --

SHADOW (CONTD)
I don’t know where you’re from
pal but we have laws against
trespassing

RUTGER
(German accent)
Where I am from we have laws
against breaking into safes

SHADOW
Was just helpin’ out a buddy who
lost his keys

Rutger grins

RUTGER
Mr Rausch is waiting

SHADOW
Who
EXT GHOST’S GARAGE - LONG ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER
Amidst the rust a shiny silver Maybach idles by the curb
Rutger opens the car door Shadow eyes the dark interior

where the silhouette of a mysterious man waits

DISSOLVE TO
INT CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - ATLANTIC CITY - DAY

POV BLINK BLINK The room blurry in the fog of
hangover which lifts to reveal a 45 automatic and
behind it a jittery Chris Tucker clone

GUNMAN
Top of the mornin’ muhfuggah --

We meet the man at the business-end of the gun DANNY “THE
GHOST” WADE (late-thirties) He groans groggy from a late
night of unsuccessful gambling and successful drinking

GHOST
Aww Jeeesus --

He manages to sit

GHOST (CONTD)
Awwwww sweet titty-fuckin’
Christ

And he tries to piece together ‘last night’

GHOST (CONT’D)
Where’s that red head

GUNMAN
I look like ‘lost and found’ to you

GHOST
Not so loud Put some coffee on

Indignant the Gunman waves his weapon in Ghost’s face

GUNMAN
See this Fuck-0O It’s called a
gun

Ghost focuses on the gun now tilted sideways ‘gang style’

GHOST
That what that is Couldn’t tell
by the way you’re holding it

And in a move so quick it defies physics Ghost snatches the
gun and points it at the Gunman who stands there wondering
what just happened

GHOST (CONTD)
(rising groggy)
Wanna be taken seriously learn to
hold it properly Straight up

The intruder raises his hands but Ghost tosses the gun back
to him and waddles to the bathroom

GHOST (CONT’D)
Get some coffee on

And he takes a leak his back to the Gunman who regroups

GUNMAN
G-Lo wants his money Here -- now
Or youre a dead man

Ghost looks back over his shoulder smiles

GHOST
Dead man I owe too much for that

Ghost puts everything away and turns

GHOST (CONTD)
Borrow a little money it’s your
problem Borrow a lot it’s the
bank’s problem

The door is suddenly kicked in and Rutger now accessorized
with a Mossberg 12-gauge enters

RUTGER
(to the first Gunman)
Faahk off --

And the huge 12-gauge suggests it’s an excellent idea The
initial Gunman apoplectic stomps out

RUTGER (CONTD)
(to Ghost)
Mr Rausch is waiting

GHOST
Ah great
(then)
Who’s Mr Rausch

EXT CHEAP MOTEL PARKING LOT - A MINUTE LATER

Ghost barefoot and in his boxers is led to the idling
Maybach and climbs in
INT MAYBACH - CONTINUOUS

Ghost settles into the plush leather beside impeccable MR
WILHELM RAUSCH of undeterminable age His face is terribly
wrinkled but the pale blue eyes sparkle with intelligence

MR RAUSCH
You couldn’t put your trousers on

GHOST
Red-head took ‘em Long story

Mr Rausch’s eyes dance with amusement

GHOST (CONT’D)
Do I uh owe you money

MR RAUSCH
I’m here to give you money

Eh Rausch lowers the smoked-glass partition to the front
where Shadow is sitting Ghost’s eyes flare

GHOST
What the fuck is this

SHADOW
Wonderful to see you again too

MR RAUSCH
I have a job for you two

GHOST
You have a nice day

He goes to exit but Rausch puts a manicured hand on him

MR RAUSCH
I pay you one million dollars each

Ghost pauses

MR RAUSCH (CONTD)
It’s simple break into Interpol’s
evidence room in Paris retrieve a
little envelope and collect your
reward What is less simple it
must be done very quickly It
requires improvisation your great
speciality I’m told

SHADOW
And I told you we don’t need him
GHOST
(laughs )
He couldn’t tie his shoelaces
without me

SHADOW
Who’s wearing the pants smart guy

They trade stink-eyes

MR RAUSCH
It has also been made clear to me
that together you make fire but
apart you are just hot air So
my question can you put aside your
history for three days and do this

It hangs there

INT PLAZA PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT

The remnants of meals and coffee cups Ghost and Shadow pour
over schematics of the Paris Interpol office They’ve been
at it for awhile Ghost looks over studying --

Mr Rausch who is staring out the panoramic windows at his
Gods eye view the world The city-glow dazzling his eyes
His thin wrinkled hands on his silver-knobbed cane

GHOST
What do you know about Goebbles
there

SHADOW

He’s good for the dough

GHOST
Good enough I guess

Rutger enters hands Mr Rausch a phone and they leave the
room Shadow tosses his plans on the table

SHADOW
It’s like Fort Knox this place
There’s no way to soft-shoe in

GHOST
It’s simple We’ll do a Trojan
Horse

SHADOW

No no No more of your ‘ready
fire aim’ I’m gonna call this
GHOST
I get us in you get us out Like

always

SHADOW
You mean you fuck it all up and I
have to fix it -- like always

Ghost chuckles

SHADOW (CONT’D)
While you’ve been losing your
pants I pulled off eight primo
gigs including that Merchants
caper

GHOST
You call that a gig I heard you
nearly blew yourself to Jersey

SHADOW
Yeah What jobs have you pulled

GHOST
I went straight remember

SHADOW
You went unemployed

Ghost rises Shadow rises

SHADOW (CONTD)
We gonna do this again

GHOST
I don’t know you gonna apologize

SHADOW
Fine I’m sorry I called you a
washed-up shill who owes money all
over Gods green earth

GHOST
Accepted

SHADOW
Your turn

GHOST

What What did I do

Shadow just stares
GHOST (CONTD)
Aww Christ Sofia You’re still
sore about Sofia

Shadow’s eyes darken
GHOST (CONTD)
Come on that was an unhealthy
relationship and you know it I
set you both free Hell -- I want
a ‘thank you’
He gets a punch And like that they’re duking it out

GHOST (CONT’D)
Cease The Man’s behind you

He points over Shadow’s shoulder

SHADOW
Yeah I’m gonna fall for that

GHOST
(puts down his dukes)
Seriously He looks pissed

Shadow turns Mr Rausch is there looking pissed -- but it
doesn’t stop Ghost from throwing that sucker punch

Which Shadow senses and whirls throwing his own punch and --

CRACK Both connect -- landing on their asses -- clicking
jaws
MR RAUSCH
This was a mistake
GHOST
This -- this is just our process
(smiles)

Were ready

Ghost and Shadow regard one another -- ‘to be continued’

INT AIR FRANCE 747 - FLYING - DAY

Ghost in his complimentary slippers settled into luxury like
a pig in merde

GHOST
Good to be back in first class

He looks at Shadow wearing his eye-mask plugged into his
headphones shutting Ghost out completely

GHOST (CONT’D)
We had some good times in Europe

Crickets

GHOST (CONTD)
So we’re not going to talk Okay
Fine I don’t need to talk

He drains his champagne goes for Shadow’s untouched glass -
SWISH -- like lightning Shadow grabs his hand -- blindly

Shadow moves his champagne further away He doesn’t want it
but he’1l be damned if Ghost is going to drink it

GHOST (CONT’D)
Sourpuss

Ghost eyes his watch shifts sitting still and silent is
torture He cranes gazing about behind him is a gorgeous
Asian woman -- all alone How the hell did he miss that

GHOST (CONTD)
Konnichiwa

She looks at him and in Oxford English --

ASIAN WOMAN
Are you Japanese

GHOST
Ah you speak English

ASTAN WOMAN
And Cantonese Mandarin Mongolian
but not Japanese

GHOST
An amazing coincidence because
neither do I

He grins She smiles He extends a hand

GHOST (CONTD)
Jim Jim Beam

ASIAN WOMAN
Jade Jade Baijiu

She removes her sunglasses and we see the reason for her
name her eyes are deep green Exotic lady And her
stunning legs are not lost on a connoisseur like Ghost

GHOST
Pleasure

TIME CUT TO

Ghost sitting next to Jade now both laughing and well-
oiled He coaxes her feet into Air France slippers

GHOST (CONT’D)
You have sensationally strong legs

so you must be a ballerina
JADE
Close
GHOST
I give up What takes you to
Paris
JADE

You don’t want to know

GHOST
Now I really do

She lingers enigmatic then leans close

JADE
I’m going there to kill a ghost

He sobers and she with him

JADE (CONTD)
- unless said ghost will accept
my proposition

He recovers

GHOST
I’m guessing it has nothing to do
with joining the 30000 mile club

JADE
What

GHOST
Never mind Continue

JADE
I’m ‘guessing’ Mr Rausch offered
two million for your services

GHOST
Close

JADE
Youll never collect He’1ll double
cross you That’s his nature

GHOST
And what’s your nature

JADE
My people are prepared to offer you
two and a half Up front

GHOST
I like your people And you have
prettier feet than Mr Rausch

JADE
Do we have a deal

GHOST
As a courtesy I’1l have to run it
past my junior associate He’s weak-
willed and greedy so I don’t see a
problem How do I reach you

Like magic a card appears in her hand He takes it and as
if on cue --

The seat-belts sign GONGS warning of imminent descent

INT CHARLES DE GAULLE IMMIGRATION - MORNING

Ghost and Shadow in separate lines Ghost steps up to the
counter and hands his passport over

GHOST
Bonjour
The surly Officer logs Ghost’s passport -- stamps it as if
were a roach -- and practically spits --
OFFICER

Enjoy Paris Mr Murgatroyd

Ghost reaches for his passport when a HANDCUFF snaps around
his wrist and there is --

HENRI BRASSE (40s) grinning like all of Christmas An
Interpol ID is clipped to his jacket-pocket

HENRI
Welcome to France Ghost

He relishes Ghost’s stunned look then cuffs his other hand

GHOST
(fuck)
Thank you Henri You look great

HENRI
I am great Very great

He leads Ghost to where a simmering Shadow also cuffed is
crowded by other Interpol agents He admires that view

HENRI (CONTD)
The Ghost and the Shadow back
together
(Slaps their cheeks)
I thought you were estranged
Something about a woman no

Shadow’s eyes narrow Ghost shakes his head at Henri ‘don’t
go there’ Henri hands his phone to an Agent fixes his hair
and poses heroically with his catch

HENRI (CONTD)
For my mother Say fromage

A picture is taken

HENRI (CONTD)
Excellent Come I have arranged
special accommodations for you

Ghost sees Jade watching and throws her a c’est la vie shrug

INT INTERPOL BLACK MARIA - DRIVING - DAY

Ghost and Shadow shackled to the bench Across from them
Henri removes a small bottle of Champagne from his jacket

HENRI
I keep this in my desk since 2003
for this occasion

GHOST
Why so small

HENRI
Because they demoted me for missing
you in Monaco But now I am a hero

He pops the bottle and drinks Savoring the moment
HENRI (CONTD)

Other than my divorce this may be
the happiest day of my life

SHADOW
Thrilled for you But how’d you
know we were comin’

HENRI
The name on Ghost’s passport You
used it once long ago to enter
Spain I had it flagged

SHADOW
(to Ghost)
You-recycled-a-name

Shadow lunges for Ghost but alas the shackles

HENRI
Tiny mistakes catch big criminals

GHOST
Criminals You got the wrong guys
were just thieves Good thieves

HENRI
No more amis No more

SHADOW
(to Ghost)
I’m going to kill you I am going
to fucken kill you

HENRI
After you confess to the Regent
diamond the Monet -- everything

He takes another swig of that glorious champagne

EXT INTERPOL HEADQUARTERS - LYONS - DAY

A sprawling modern glass-and-steel fortress

INT HOLDING CELL - INTERPOL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Ghost and Shadow are shackled to the bench Two stoic
Interpol Agents stand by the door watching them

GHOST
I really gotta pee You know pipi

The Agents don’t flinch Just stand there Indomitable

INT INTERPOL HEADQUARTERS CORRIDOR - DAY

Henri practically dancing as he carries two fat case files
and boards --

AN ELEVATOR
Swiping his ID card to light up the panel He rides to --
THE BASEMENT

Swipes his card to gain access to the holding-room wing A
Guard lets him through a barred door and --

He strides briskly down the rows stopping at --
CELL 21
Swipes his card and the door THUNKS open Voila --

The Two Stoic Agents exactly where they were and as Henri
enters -- a HANDCUFF snaps around his wrist and he realizes

-- The two uniformed Agents standing are Ghost and Shadow

-- The two criminals out cold on the bench sans their
clothes are his trusted agents

Henri frozen as Ghost cuffs his other hand

GHOST
Tiny mistakes free big thieves

Exploding in French profanity too ripe to print Henri is
shackled to his agents They take his ID his phone

GHOST (CONTD)
(clapping Henri’s cheek)
No hard feelings It’s all in the
game as they say

HENRI
I will kill you I swear it on my
mother’s name My father’s grave

Henri screaming for the Guard is cut off by the closing door
and what follows is quick

-- A pre-cut photo with sticky-backing of a smiling Ghost is
placed over Henri’s scowling face on the ID

-- The boys exit the wing waving to the bored Guard

-- Swipe Henri’s card on the elevator and board as if they
invented the Interpol nodding to a group of Agents inside

-- Cross a cubicle maze with its frantic chatter of keyboards
and Agents hot in the grips of criminal obsession

-- Are briefly waylaid by a throng celebrating some division
Chiefs birthday party and they sing-along to Joyeux
Anniversaire

-- Down a set of stairs passing a hot Female Agent on her
way up holding a salad Ghost stops Shadow yanks him along

EVIDENCE ROOM COUNTER

Bullet-proof glass cameras The boys arrive Ghost slipping
a pre-filled Evidence Request and Henri’s ID under the glass

EVIDENCE OFFICER
(in French)
It will take awhile You can wait
or come back

Ghost smiles he doesn’t speak French

GHOST
(thick French accent)
Anglaise please Our Hamerican
agent here suspects we are keeping
secrets

SHADOW
Hey trust but verify Frenchie

They trade scowls The Officer looks down his nose at Shadow
and says something disparaging in French that makes him howl
Ghost throws his head back and roars conspiratorial As the
Officer departs --

SHADOW (CONT’D)
What the hell was that about

Ghost shrugs ‘haven’t a clue’

CUT TO

CELL 21

The Guard hears pounding -- decides to open the door and gets
blasted by Henri screaming --
HENRI
(in French)
You let them out you imbecile
Get me a phone A bolt cutter

EVIDENCE ROOM

CUT TO

A WALL CLOCK TICKS LOUDLY Shadow drums his fingers

SHADOW

What’s he doing in there grouting
GHOST

Relax
SHADOW

Don’t tell me to ‘relax’ You told

me that in Louisville

GHOST
Exactly

SHADOW
Exactly what I ended up in the
clink

GHOST

If you’d chilled out you’d have
walked out with me

SHADOW
ME ‘NOT RELAXING’ WAS THE ONLY
REASON YOU GOT TO WALK OUT

GHOST
Easy-easy you’re developing spots

SHADOW
Don’t ease me If he’s not out in
thirty seconds we’re goin’ in

GHOST
Fine
(Low)
If you relax

CUT TO

CELL 21

Henri screaming into a phone as the Guard works a bolt
cutter

HENRI
(in French)
Imbecile I am lieutenant Henri
Brasse seal the gates

The last chain is cut and he tears off like Greyhound

EVIDENCE COUNTER

Shadow about to blow a gasket when the Officer returns
holding THE ENVELOPE sealed in plastic Yes No --

The son-of-a-bitch stops to answer a RINGING PHONE Uh-oh
Ghost and Shadow weighing their options So close

Ah the call isn’t about them because the Officer starts
looking something up on the computer Something complicated

TICK TOCK TICK TOCK

Ghost and Shadow blue-balled Staring daggers

The Officer looking bored taking his sweet fucking time
The GRINDING of Shadow’s teeth building and he explodes

just as the Officer hangs up -- choking down that rage and
turning it into the tightest smile in history

SHADOW
Merci

A subtle tug of war between the boys for the envelope which
Ghost wins and as they start out --

SMASH CUT TO

CORRIDOR

Henri busting out of an elevator sprinting along a corridor
CUT TO

UNDER GROUND PARKING GARAGE

Ghost hot-wiring a nice Mercedes almost as quickly as if he
had the keys They hop in peal out

INT MERCEDES - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

Shadow navigating out of the Interpol’s underground garage
Ghost next to him game-faced

They emerge into daylight and ahead a small line of cars
stuck behind the ‘sealed’ gate

GHOST
What’s the hold up

SHADOW
Shiiiit
THEIR POV Henri running along the driveway towards the guard
booth ahead

Shadow stamps the gas races into the oncoming lane and
clips Henri sending him sprawling onto the grass Ina
flash Shadow is out of the car and

EXT INTERPOL HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

dives on Henri Ghost moves in just as Guards from the
booth come running weapons drawn

HENRI
ARREST THESE MEN

Shadow pops Henri on the chin and he wallows dazed
SHADOW
(to the Guards)
This man’s our prisoner He broke
free of his shackles

The Guard sees the busted shackles on Henri

SHADOW (CONTD)
Gimme your handcuffs

The Guard complies and Shadow cuffs a struggling Henri

HENRI
I am Henri Barasse I ordered --

Shadow stuffs Henri’s tie in his mouth

SHADOW
Enough outta you
(to the Guards)
That is Henri Barasse

He points to Ghost who proudly flashes his ID Henri
writhes and screams through a mouth-full of Paisley tie

SHADOW (CONTD)
(re Henri)
Keep him here His accomplice
jumped the fence We’re going
after open the gate

GHOST
Alle Alle

They dart back to the Mercedes One befuddled Guard secures
Henri as the other bolts to open the gate

The Mercedes races to the front of the line and out

INT ST MICHEL —- PARIS - EVENING

Ah the romantic Seine Ghost and Shadow in a quiet alcove
waiting for a canalboat Ghost checks the time

SHADOW (0S)
Gods phone number

Ghost looks at Shadow who is puzzling over the mysterious
envelope still sealed in ‘evidence plastic’ It’s obviously
ancient with a crimson blotch from its violent travels

SHADOW (CONT’D)
The Colonel’s secret recipe

GHOST
Stop Put it away

SHADOW
It’s driving me nuts What is this
thing

GHOST
What do we care

SHADOW
If he’s paying us two it’s worth
four And with two interested
parties maybe five

Their eyes lock a little glint which Ghost shakes off

GHOST
We made a deal shook hands on it

SHADOW
We’re thieves

GHOST
We never broke our word

SHADOW
And what do we have to show for it

GHOST
We can still hold our heads high
Violate your own code and who knows
where you end up

Shadow fingers the envelope its mystery pulling on him

SHADOW
We make a copy and sell it to both
of them -- the Asian and the

German Everyone’s a winner
That’s honorable

Ghost just laughs which irks Shadow

SHADOW (CONTD)
You know we should have been
retired long ago -- we coulda been
legends -- if it wasn’t for your
moronic sense of chivalry

GHOST
Look at the bright side come
sunset we’ll be rid of each other
for good

SHADOW
Let’s hope

They give each other their backs

GHOST
Here it comes is he alone

They gaze at the canal-boat Mr Rausch standing in the front
by himself in the mostly empty boat Ghost and Shadow board
INT CANALBOAT - CONTINUOUS

Their eyes flick over the passengers No Rutger just a

Romantic Couple They go to Mr Rausch perched with his
cane and grinning like a devil A briefcase at his feet

MR RAUSCH
Why the last minute change We
could have done this in the hotel
over a glass of champagne

GHOST
This is more romantic

MR RAUSCH
If you say so Shall we sit

They pass the couple making out to grab a bench in the back
ANGLE ON - A SMALL DARK CAR

Following along on the street beside the boat

BENCH

Mr Rausch hands them the briefcase Ghost cracks it and
it’s full of Andrew Jacksons in neat 10K bricks

Shadow a bit demure hands the envelope to Mr Rausch

MR RAUSCH (CONT’D)
You didn’t open it

SHADOW
As you can see the evidence seal
is still intact

Mr Rausch checks the seal and stares religiously at the
envelope

SHADOW (CONTD)
Mind telling us what it is

Mr Rausch just smiles enigmatic
MR RAUSCH
Nothing you would understand

Enjoy your romantic cruise

He rises with a nod and moves forward speaking to the
captain about putting ashore at the next dock

GHOST
Well that’s that

They both grab for the briefcase a little tug of war

GHOST (CONTD)
You think I’d try to ditch you

SHADOW
In a New York heartbeat

GHOST
See if you’re thinking I’d do
that you must be thinking of doin’
it to me

SHADOW
Shit look behind you --

GHOST
Yeah I’m gonna fall for that

SHADOW
Seriously

There is an audible CLICK Ghost turns the amorous couple
are on their feet the man levelling a freshly cocked 9mm
He points to the briefcase beckons ‘hand it over’

Ghost and Shadow look at Mr Rausch who offers a little
smile then gives them their back

GHOST
Double-crossing bastard

SHADOW
(through his teeth)
Least we have our honor right

As they hand the suitcase over the gun man pitches into
Ghost’s arms spitting blood He’s been knifed in the back

THUMP A figure drops from the bridge they’re passing under
and lands in the boat soft as a cat Jade

MR RAUSCH
Kill her
The Amorous Woman lunges with a knife -- Jade kicks breaking
the woman’s arm -- spins the other way in a perfect hook-kick

-- dropping her instantly and --

A silenced pistol magically appears in Jade’s hand trained
directly on Ghost’s heart His hands shoot up

GHOST
I was gonna call you

JADE
WHERE IS IT

Ghost points Jade whirls and there is Mr Rausch his cane
raised -- POP -- it fires a single bullet --

Knocking Jade over the gunwale into the dark water
ANGLE ON - RUTGER

Out of the black car he’s been following in -- levelling a
suppressed Steyr machine gun -- he fires on --

GHOST AND SHADOW

Seats are chewed to shit around them But they have the
metal briefcase -- which saves their lives from a bullet --
before they vault overboard into the murky Seine

MR RAUSCH

Screams at the boat captain who veers to a little dock and
Rutger comes running helping his leiter to dry land

MR RAUSCH
(in German)
I have it Go

They scramble to Rutger’s car and peal off

GHOST AND SHADOW

Sputtering as they’re swept along with the detritus Shadow
flops and gurgles He never got around to learn swimming

certainly not while holding a briefcase full of cash that’s
filling with water and he --

SLIPS BENEATH THE SURFACE

Being pulled down by the briefcase until he finally and
very painfully lets it go

ABOVE SURFACE

Ghost grabs a sputtering Shadow and does the backward
‘lifesaving swim’ holding onto him

SHADOW
Whatd I tell you Stupid dim-
witted idiot

Shadow reaches back squeezing his hands around Ghost’s
throat

GHOST
(choking)
CUD ID OUD

Ghost slips under pulling Shadow with him Drowning Shadow
comes to grips with the flaw in his plan and releases

They break the surface sputtering and gasping

EXT SEINE - SAME TIME
A soaking figure climbs out of the river Jade

She pulls off her shirt -- blood streams from a nasty bullet-
hole in her flank It doesn’t seem to faze her

She rubs her hands together very quickly as if building a
static-charge then holds them just above the wound

The flow of blood mysteriously ebbs and ceases completely

EXT BRIDGE - SEINE - SAME TIME

Ghost and Shadow have shimmied up onto some bridge pylons
and here they sit dripping among the rats of Paris

Shadow reaches inside his soggy jacket relieved to find a
little scroll rolled up in a plastic bag

GHOST
What’s that

SHADOW
Whaddya think it is

It’s what was inside the envelope they stole

GHOST
Shit You didn’t

SHADOW
Of course I did Fool

GHOST
You lying two-timing conniving
beautiful sack-of-shit

SHADOW
You’re welcome

Ghost roars

GHOST
Id pay to see his face right now

INT RUTGER’S CAR - IDLING - SAME TIME

Mr Rausch’s face a cold frozen mask as he stares at the
envelope he has just opened Very empty His eyes slowly
lift murderous

MR RAUSCH
Find them

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MARBELLA - SPAIN - DAY

Rolls Royces loaded with some Sheik’s hundred best friends
glide past One Rolls pulls to the curb and a well-fed
Westernized Arab gets out HAMID (50s) purveyor of things
stolen worldwide

EXT HAMID’S SEASIDE VILLAPATIO - MINUTES LATER

Hamid steps out with a gun pointing it at the two louts
sunbathing and eating dates in his expensive deck chairs

GHOST
Eyyy Hamid Come on in

Shadow and Ghost rise and now Hamid sees who it is

HAMID
By the damp balls of Christ --

SHADOW
So you still remember us

HAMID
How can I forget The only two
thieves in the world with the
lowest criminal cunning and the
highest moral standards

He tucks away the gun and gives them the Arab hug
HAMID (CONTD)
Nice of you to invite me into my

own home

GHOST
Don’t mention it Have a date

There’s a whimper Hamid sees his Butler tied up and gagged

SHADOW
He was very persistent denying us
your hospitality

Hamid unties his Butler

HAMID
Antonio bring me the King Louis
from the special cellar

The Butler pats down his ruffled hair and snaps to Hamid
sits with the boys grinning

HAMID (CONTD)
I thought you two had split up
Something about a woman no

Shadow chews teeth Ghost shakes his head ‘don’t go there’

HAMID (CONTD)
Ah never mind How is business

GHOST
Lately quite brisk Hence we need
your help

Shadow removes the little scroll and splays it out on the
table At last the mysterious contents of the envelope

A PIECE OF ANCIENT PAPER WITH A CIRCLE OF STRANGE SYMBOLS

SHADOW
You have any idea what that is

Hamid reacts as if was the severed head of his favorite wife

GHOST
You uh okay

HAMID
I am just remembering I have a
prior engagement with King Fahdad
I’1l find you a hotel and we’ll --

Ghost and Shadow put some calming hands on him

SHADOW
Easy friend you’re breaking into
a flop sweat

HAMID
You bring a a plague into my
house and expect me to what
Shadow and Ghost look at each other Plague

GHOST

Just tell us what we have here
HAMID

Then you leave -- right away -- and

never tell a soul you were here

They nod Deal

INT HAMID’S VILLA - MOMENTS LATER

Full of ancient artifacts Hamid locks the front door
curtains quivering with paranoia Over this --

HAMID
You have no idea Honestly

They don’t making him laugh

HAMID (CONTD)
Who built the greatest Empire in
history

SHADOW
Genghis Khan

HAMID
Genghis Khan They buried him in
secret killed everyone who might
reveal his tomb -- except one head
monk The map he made 800 years
ago was rumored to have resurfaced
a week ago in Hong Kong

A-ha Shadow sees the angle now

SHADOW
The greatest emperor in history
they’d have buried him with a
mountain of gold right

HAMID
Likely but that is not the prize
everyone is after

Oh

HAMID (CONTD)

The real prize is the greatest
artifact in history -- the Spear of
Destiny

pulls

GHOST
Wow That sounds underwhelming

Hamid pads the line of ancient books and pulls one opening
it to Fra Angelico’s haunting fresco of Jesus being lanced
on the cross by the Roman Longinus’ spear

SHADOW
The spear that killed Christ
(laughs )
Really

HAMID
It‘s said ‘whoever wields the
spear has the power to bend the
destiny of the world to their
will’

Shadow can’t help but laugh

SHADOW
It’s a tiger dick

HAMID
Come again

SHADOW
Some folks believe if you eat tiger
dick your wang gets bigger

GHOST
Youve tried this

HAMID
Whether you believe in the spear’s
power or not is inconsequential
It’s priceless But consider this
Charlemagne had it won 47 battles
The Visquots who sacked Rome had
it The last man to have the spear
was Genghis Khan -- only the
greatest conqueror in history

Hamid pushes the book to them ‘read for yourself’

SHADOW
A treasure map to the greatest
score in history That’s got to be
worth a sweet song

GHOST
(to Hamid)
Make us an offer
Ghost laughs Hamid looks at him ‘what’s funny’

HAMID
Not a chance sadiqi I treasure
life Besides you opened the
envelope so how do I know it’s not
a fake There have been many
Hitler thought he had the real map
twice

GHOST
I thought you said Hitler

HAMID
It’s the reason he invaded Russia
and Africa when he did

It hangs there

Say what

GHOST
Maybe we just sell it back to the
original two bidders after all

HAMID
Youll have the same problem They
will want to know if you doctored
the map whether you made copies
How can they ever know for sure
without torturing you

HAMID (CONTD)
You see when you opened that
envelope you cursed yourself
They’1l never stop looking for you
and their power is vast

GHOST
See what you’ve done

SHADOW

I do and you’re welcome

(getting infected)
If it’s the greatest score in
history we should be the ones
pulling it We keep Khan’s gold
and sell them the spear Curse
solved Everyone wins

GHOST
Funny I was just thinking that

SHADOW
Of course you were How do we
decipher the map

HAMID
Simple You need the Star of Asia
GHOST
Ah great
(then)

What is it

HAMID
A 200 karat sapphire Khan carried
with him Hitler managed to secure
it in 1943 so in all likelihood it
was sent with other artifacts for
safe-keeping in Austria

Hamid licks his lips seeing his own angle here
HAMID (CONTD)
I could find out exactly where and
advise you on how to use it for
an anonymous tiny percentage of
the back end

He grins like a jackal They grin

SHADOW
Interpol’s got our face plastered
on every TV from here to scratch-my-
ass and you’re cavorting in a hot
tub full of people who can peg us

GHOST
(grins)
I’m hoping they peg us Christ
look at them

SHADOW
You know there’s something really
wrong with you

GHOST
I think there’s something wrong
with you Why do you hate fun
He pokes Ghost in the chest with a finger
SHADOW
You’re not gonna get me killed
Fuck up and I will throw you under
the bus pal Without a second
thought Remember that
Ghost is about to say ‘easy’ but Shadow cocks a fist

SHADOW (CONTD)
Go ahead say it

Ghost just shakes his head sadly Shadow tosses a thick
file on the table

GHOST
From Hamid

Ghost picks up the file and flips through it

GHOST (CONTD)
This is where Star of Asia is

PHOTO a huge castle perched in the alps

GHOST (CONT’D)

Ghost laughs

SHADOW
Yeah hysterical till you check

Ghost flips pages of complex blue-prints and schematics his
levity turning to outrage

GHOST
What’s wrong with these people

SHADOW
They’re paranoid or hordin’ some
real precious shit in there Or
both

Ghost keeps flipping scratching his head

SHADOW (CONT’D)
While you ponder a way in I’1l
fall on my sword and entertain our
guests

He strides outside strips to his tiger-stripe undies and
climbs into the hot tub with the women

into another rental Fiat They in turn are watching --

Guns show a lack of creativity

Henri goes to shout -- Ghost clamps his mouth And they move
away from the corner like three really close pals

SHADOW
We actually like you you know

A gun kisses the back of Shadow’s head One of Henri’s men
They release Henri who grins so hard he twitches

HENRI
Love you too

He’s about to cuff them when inexplicably the Agent next to
Henri is flung off his feet through the glass storefront

CHU CHU Another Agent goes down Silenced guns

She breaks cover spring-boards off a street-cafe table to
grab the wrought-iron balcony above And up towards the roof
she goes balcony-to-balcony -- beautiful and frightening

Realizes the game has moved as he sees Jade up on the roof
He takes off following along the street

Ghost and Shadow halted by an eight-foot gap between
buildings And back there is Jade coming like a tiger

Then he notices a formidable enemy staring at him Big
Italian Mama in the carnage of her culinary temple

Reaching the gap spots Ghost vanishing down the alley below
She dives grabbing the broken wire dangling and repels down

Sees Ghost hit the street up the block He rips the driver
out of a tiny Alfa Romeo convertible and flings him away

rubber leaving Henri emptying his gun after him

off a shot CLICK Empty She runs past the Italian Mama

heart sinking It really is a terrible place

Ghost pulls up hanging up a call with Hamid

A crowd of Scions wait to be lifted into the clouds Almost
everyone has a European man-purse No people of color here

Eyes study Ghost and Shadow -- and they give it right back

If you had a ‘good feeling’ I’d be
worried

The Gondola emerges from the mist and there is the castle as
if floating in the clouds

EXT THE LEGION OF SCION CASTLE - MINUTES LATER
They step off with the others moving through a long stone
corridor lit by torches held by towering muscular men of
the finest Aryan stock All in dark robes It opens into --

Ringed by statues of nymphs and satyrs are hundreds of Scions
in black suits with shiny lapel pins drinking from crystal
glasses Old money and power An orchestra grinds Wagner

Jesus where’s the casket
They burrow into the crowd A fat man corners them
momentarily jabbering in German Ghost throws his head back
roaring slapping the guy on the back
What the fuck was that about Ghost shrugs no idea

They backpedal quickly into the crowd

GHOST
Relax I planned for this Go
around the other side

They go that way when a BELL TOLLS eliciting CHEERS and
robed Aryan Monks begin to sheep-dog the crowd inside

SHADOW
I’m not going in there

But Rutger is lingering out here with Mr Rausch

GHOST
We can’t stay out here

They are absorbed into the river of people heading inside

INT CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Chandeliers tapestries and giant portraits of old battles
with heroic Aryans defeating barbarian hordes They are
swept along on the Scion tide into --

A MAJESTIC HALL

In the center a circular floor with occult symbols ringed
with lanterns At its nucleus a small pit with an altar

Ghost and Shadow are pressed together with giddy Scions

SHADOW
Wouldn’t be a plan of yours if it
didn’t go to shit right

Rutger passes and takes a seat some rows ahead and the heavy
doors are shut by the Guards Lights dim Silence falls

Mr Rausch inexplicably appears in the center pit as if he
sprung out of the Earth itself He enters a spotlight Pale
eyes sparkling with evil intelligence

MR RAUSCH
Welcome Scions in a world
growing fractured by religion
dwindling resources and the
politics of profit we are reminded
about the importance of unity The
power of will of sacrifice towards
a shared goal Behold what is
possible with unity

He sweeps his hand and the floor is taken by several Monks
who disrobe to reveal powerful physiques They lock together
like human Lego creating structures that defy gravity

The crowd ooohs and ahhhs Shadow eyes his watch

ON THE FLOOR

A white dove is tethered to the center The Monks encircle
it holding hands and descend into trance thrumming with

energy It builds the Monks’ eyes rolling white and --

The dove squawks fluttering in terror before it’s pinned on
its side by an unseen force It kicks twice and dies

The crowd goes nuts and the boys move for the exit stopped
short by the abrupt silence as Mr Rausch retakes the floor

MASTER
In our history there has been one
overriding ambition true mystical
power old as time itself A power
to usher in the new world order we
have all dreamt of

He lets that sink in then --

MASTER (CONTD)
We are very close Scions closer
than in centuries Standing in our
way are two minor hindrances --

Ghost and Shadow’s photos appear on a forty foot screen

MASTER (CONTD)
Two pernicious thieves who have
stolen from us We must use every
resource to find them They will
be caught and shown the full
meaning of suffering

Clenched Ghost and Shadow absorb their newfound fame

It dawns on the Gangly Guy beside Shadow that he’s seen these
‘thieves’ before His eyes travel to Shadow mouth opening --

Shadow chops him in the throat The man hooks over gagging
Shadow quickly escorts him up the aisle like a concerned
Scion helping his over-imbibed brother Ghost follows
shaking his head

GHOST
Schnapps

The commotion makes heads turn including Rutger’s

Mr Rausch seeing nothing beyond the stage lights launches
back in and people direct their attention there Except --

Rutger who turns back something tripping his sixth sense

INT UTILITY CLOSET - SCHLOSS ADLER - MOMENTS LATER

Shadow ties up the cold-cocked Gangly Guy and notices a cool
gold figurine on the shelf Looks valuable And look how
nicely it fits in his man-purse Ghost steps out into --

MAN’S VOICE
Meine Herre

Ghost turns a barrel-chested Guard approaches

GHOST
Guten haben

His punch connects perfectly with the Guard’s chin and it
does nothing except surprise the hulk A quick follow-up
kick to the balls elicits the same stunning disregard

The Guard grabs Ghost by the throat lifting him off his feet
with Herculean vibes No worries out of the closet comes --

Shadow drilling a punch to the side of the Guard’s head
And like that both boys are dangling by their necks

strangling

The Guard grins until Shadow slugs him across the dome

with his gold-weighted man-purse The hulk’s eyes flicker
and down he goes

Ghost rubbing his throat looks at their saving grace --
Shadow’s purse

dozes in his chair He bats his eyes which flare wide --

Shadow ties up the Guard as Ghost pulls out ANNA’S JAMMER
DEVICE A nifty plug-in like a Mase-Hamilton interface

GHOST
Here goes nothin’

He plugs it into the mainframe and wow nothing happens

SHADOW
Shouldn’t something be happening

GHOST
I’m sure it’ll be fine

Why the hell did we trust her

Because she’s still in love with
me

We’re fucked

GHOST
Why so negative

SHADOW
Because hanging around you I’ve
gotten used to disappointment

There is a LOUD WHIRRING Cycling images on monitors freeze
Lights on the control board all come on locking up The
system is jammed

They look at each other
GHOST
You were saying
INT CASTLE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Rutger exits the hall and finds a Guard by the entrance
RUTGER
(in German)
Three men left where did they go
The Guard clicks his radio speaks in German No answer from
Security Central That’s weird Rutger’s eyes turn icy
INT SCRIPTORUM - TWO MINUTES LATER
Ghost and Shadow drop from an air duct into a massive
repository with centuries of books and documents in the

Scion’s cause

Large murals and tapestries of well-fed Aryans from the ages
stare down their nose at the boys as they --

Have at an impressive door with a space-age lock using the
oldest tool in the profession -- the lock-pick

Their hands work in beautiful syncopation like two surgeons
The lock succumbs and they step into --

A LONG CORRIDOR

Modern linoleum and track lights old stone walls They pass
several rooms and stop dead

THEIR POV a room covered entirely in white tiles Handcuffs
on chains dangle from the ceiling A stainless-steel chair
with restraints Electrical clamps A floor drain

GHOST
Must be the entertainment room

SHADOW
Let’s not be the entertainment

The door to the Scriptorum BANGS OPEN at the far end of the
corridor Rutger and a horde of huge Guards A frozen beat
as the two factions regard each other Then it’s on --

Ghost and Shadow bust out running triggering a frantic chase
through the confusing maze of stone tunnels

SHADOW (CONT’D)
Are we lost

GHOST
Of course not We’re confusing
them

SHADOW

Im confused

They throw on the brakes at a junction Suddenly MONKS --
the scary ones from the hall show -- are running at them

SHADOW (CONT’D)
They don’t seem confused

Ghost and Shadow run down another corridor The ECHO of
murderous Scions bouncing through the maze at them

GHOST
How do we get out of here

SHADOW
Now you toss it in my lap

DARK STONE STAIRWAY

They race down left or right Frantic Wait there is --
THE VAULT

They race to the MASSIVE STEEL DOOR cranking the SPINDLE

The stairway behind fills with CLATTERING BOOTS They get
the huge door open and slip inside

Rutger and the Guards arrive sprinting to the vault

Ghost and Shadow struggle the door is like pushing a dead
truck and there’s not enough time

Rutger wedges himself in the closing gap They punch him

GHOST
USE YOUR PURSE

Shadow tomahawks the Aryan hulk with his purse-mace and at
last Rutger sags away They lower the thick steel cross-
braces sealing them in And sink to the floor exhausted

GHOST (CONTD)
Well I got us in

SHADOW
You sure did Genius Mastermind

He kicks the wall Cussing

GHOST
One little hiccup and you go all to
pieces

Ghost rises and takes stock walking into the vault Motion-
detector lights slam on illuminating --

THE LEGION BUNKER

Which is really a huge multi-room museum of the macabre
Humidity-controlled display cases that house all manner of
artifacts plundered by the Legion through the ages

The Pentalpha Ring the Antikythera mechanism half-encased
in rock the dagger that killed Caesar King Arthur’s
Excalibur sword the Walter PPK Hitler used to off himself

ANOTHER CHAMBER

Houses the history of weapons from a stone knife to Genghis
Khan’s bow and arrow to Hitler’s artillery -- with stacked
105mm shells and a V1 Flying Bomb They cross into --

THE MAIN VAULT

Large BANK-BOXES Gold bullion stacked in pyramids
Priceless art Dali’s Melted Clocks Andrea Mantegna’s
Crucifixion of Jesus the Mona Lisa (the real one) and on
it goes

Ghost and Shadow stand there utterly struck They start
laughing building into a knee-slapping roar
SHADOW
Finally we hit the jackpot

GHOST
Set for life

And the irony makes them convulse with laughter

INTERCUT EXT VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

Mr Rausch mouth a thin slash as he grips a phone Ghost

answers still laughing his ass off

Rausch grinds teeth

waiting for Ghost to finish He doesn’t so --

MR RAUSCH

I am willing to offer you a deal

GHOST

Your unconditional surrender

MR RAUSCH
Give us the map and you won
harmed You have my word

GHOST
Your word
(laughs )

t be

If you’d honored our deal none of

this would have happened --

MR RAUSCH
-- you cheated me --

GHOST

-- you didn’t know that before you

double crossed us --

MR RAUSCH
-- of course I did you are
low-life thugs --

GHOST
Thugs We’re honorable
practitioners of the second
profession Look Mr Clit

cheap

oldest
Van Tit

or whatever the hell your real name
is obviously our relationship
isn’t working out We should stop

seeing each other

Mr Rausch stock-still Those eyes could freeze lava

MR RAUSCH
I will see you soon

He hangs up and nods to Rutger who sparks an acetylene torch
and starts cutting into the vault door

INT VAULT - LATER

Shadow flops exhausted from busting open the bank boxes
Splayed out documents diamonds old 8mm films but --

SHADOW
No Star of Asia Hamid’s intel was
shit

Ghost pokes through items an ancient book depicting a red
dragon with an emerald eye gives him pause

GHOST
Wasn’t there a dragon like that on
the envelope we lifted

They have at the book leafing through ancient Mongolian
pages to find a central cavity inside which lies --

The STAR OF ASIA Resembling a sort of eye with its iris-
like flecks of green and brown Ghost studies it

GHOST (CONTD)
What if there’s something to this
Spear of Destiny legend

Shadow chuckles

GHOST (CONTD)
There’s obviously a bigger picture
here things beyond our grasp You
saw that shit upstairs -- how they
croaked that dove --

SHADOW
I also saw David Blaine vanish New
York once God you are so naive

GHOST
Am I I did a bit of reading

He drags Shadow to Mantegna’s painting of Jesus’ crucifixion

GHOST (CONT’D)
see those two

Points to the two men crucified on each side of the Jesus

GHOST (CONT’D)
- Demas and Gestas They were

thieves
SHADOW
No shit
GHOST
No shit Weird huh
SHADOW
Maybe a little but so what
GHOST
What if everything that’s happened
is not a coincidence
SHADOW
You mean like we’re on a mission
from God
Shadow cracks up
GHOST

Laugh all you want but Demas took
Jesus into his heart and became a
saint Gestas blasphemed and ended

up in Hell
SHADOW
I got news for you we’re both in
Hell -- sans a paddle
A HISSING interrupts They cross the chamber seeing -- the

SHARP LIGHT of an Actelyene torch cutting the vault door

GHOST
I assume you’ve given some thought
to our exit strategy

SHADOW
Yep There is no way out All we
get to choose is how to die

Ghost smiles

SHADOW (CONT’D)
Okay why are you smiling

GHOST
Because if you look closely at
Jesus

Points to painted Jesus whose mournful gaze stares off

GHOST (CONTD)
he’s telling us the way out

Ghost follows Jesus’ gaze to the 105mm artillery shells
stacked next to the WWII howitzer

SHADOW
That’s a way out all right Out
of everything The kill radius of
that thing is like fifty meters

GHOST
If we build a blast barrier using
the gold bars

SHADOW
Concussion will still suck our
lungs out

GHOST
But let’s say we survived you’d
consider it a miracle right
Shadow rolls his eyes

SHADOW
If we survive sure A miracle

CUT TO
The 105mm howitzer is aimed at the wall They heft gold bars
and everything loose in the place -- building a blast barrier
around the impact point

CUT TO

The Acetelyne torch arcing slowly across steel door almost
through Mr Rausch his mouth a thin slash waiting

CUT TO
Shadow runs the howitzer’s firing cable over to the bank-
boxes where Ghost has opened two of the largest units (with

barely enough space for a grown dog)

They crawl into their little respective safes Shadow in
control of the firing cable

SHADOW (CONT’D)
Grab your kiwis and pray to Pele

GHOST
Wait

A long beat as Ghost thinks about (possibly) his last words

GHOST (CONTD)
That thing with Sofia it was
unfortunate

SHADOW
Well-understated Why’d you do it

GHOST
It was an accident

SHADOW
You took her out on that balcony
and killed her In cold blood

GHOST
I never figured she’d fall like
that I swear

SHADOW
You knew her wings were clipped

GHOST
I thought she’d glide not plunge

A long beat
GHOST (CONT’D)

It wasn’t healthy man You
were in love with a parrot --

SHADOW
A PARROT She was a Tanimbar
Corella cockatoo -- select breeding

that went back to Chinese
empresses She had papers Spoke
three languages

(then softer)
She understood me

GHOST
She was taking over your life

It slowly dawns on Shadow now

SHADOW
Were you feelin’ threatened

GHOST
Wait-what

SHADOW
Shit It never occurred to me

GHOST
The fuck are you blabbering about

SHADOW
Hey whatever apology accepted
And Ghost

GHOST
Yeah

Shadow considers his (possibly) last words

SHADOW
Aww fuck it

GHOST
My thoughts exactly brother

SHADOW
See you on the other side

He yanks the firing cord

CUT TO BLACK

EXT CASTLE - NIGHT

The lower Western wall of castle BLOWS OUT in an immense
explosion debris cascading over the drop down the mountain

In the clouds of stone and mortar rows of bank-boxes tumble
down getting wedged in nooks and crevasses Everything
settles into granitic silence

Nothing could have survived that LONG HOLD then just as we
BEGIN TO PULL AWAY

SQUEEEAK A mangled bank-box door flops open Ghost
Bleeding from his nose and ears Utterly shell-shocked

An EERIE RINGING as he crawls out and realizes how blessed he
really is he’s on a ledge gazing over a nightmare scape of
shattered mortar twisted rebar blasted steel below

And from the heavens a FINGER OF SEARING LIGHT points down
Ghost drops to his knees in religious sublimation hands
reaching to the light of God

which ebbs as the LIGHT ABOVE sweeps around accompanied
by a HACKING

Shit It’s not God it’s a CHOPPER’S SEARCH-LIGHT

GHOST
SHADOW
Ghost scrambles up the cut limping and reeling

GHOST (CONTD)
SHADOW

He flips debris getting frantic now as the chopper draws
closer but Shadow is nowhere to be found Ghost limps
away into the darkness Alone

MOMENTS LATER

The HELO sweeps in whipping the air

CLOSER - HELO as it swivels to reveal Henri and some lantern-
jawed Bundespolizei buckled in the doorway

DISSOLVE TO

A HEINOUS GNOME grinning down at us SLOWLY PULL BACK to
reveal his gnome-hand clutching an enormous red penis

REVEAL INT MOUNTAIN CHALET - MORNING

Ghost sits up Pain He’s in someone’s vacation home
filled with Alpen bric-a-brac including the offending gnome

INT MOUNTAIN CHALET BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

Ghost juggling a cordless phone rummages in the medicine
cabinet for supplies to patch his wounds

GHOST
You’re sure

HAMID (ON PHONE)
Of course I’m sure I’m Hamid
Abdul Aziz Shadow is under heavy
guard He’ll survive But tell
me who has the map and the stone

GHOST
You’re talking to him

A little squeal escapes Hamid

HAMID
This is good This is very good
You do realize Ghost you are the
only one in 800 years that has
managed to put the Star and the map
together Right now you are how
do they say ‘The Shit’

GHOST
Funny I feel like it too

Hamid cackles

HAMID
Where are you I will send a jet

GHOST
Very charitable of you

HAMID
Well you have just been named
Interpol’s ‘Most Wanted’

GHOST
Always nice to be recognized for
one’s toil

HAMID
You are a rock star And soon
youll be richer than Mick Jagger

GHOST
After I borrow a car I’1ll tell you
where Ill be

HAMID
Wonderful and you wont do anything
stupid like try to rescue Shadow

GHOST
Not on a cold day in Hell We have
a pact “get nabbed you’re on your
own”

HAMID
Very wise See you soon

Ghost hangs up eyes dropping to the map and Star of Asia in
a little baggie on the sink The gem prisms the light
through the window So mesmerizing so heavenly

INT HOSPITAL - VIENNA - EVENING

Shadow blinks awake Eh Gad the pain Head turbaned with
bandages Cuts A sprained wing He reaches for a glass of
water but realizes he’s handcuffed Now --

Henri appears above him with an almost criminal grin He
lifts the water Shadow wants and drinks it

SHADOW
Man am I glad to see you

Henri’s smile craters he was hoping for fear not elation

HENRI
I’m going to throw you down a dark
hole Shadow A very dark hole

SHADOW
Good for you in the meantime I
assume you’ve got two guys outside
the door but you should have two
in here on each side of the room
in case --

HENRI
DON’ T-TELL-ME-HOW-TO-DO-MY-JOB

SHADOW
Look Henri these Scion freaks
aren’t gonna let you walk out of
here with me --

HENRI
I hope they take you off my hands
The things they would do to you
that I cannot
Now Shadow looks worried and finally Henri can smile again

HENRI (CONTD)
A dark hole ami

A KNOCK on the door

HENRI (CONTD)
At last Come in

Two Doctors enter One old one young

HENRI (CONTD)
He’s awake Lucid Fit to travel

DOCTOR
I will determine that not you

The Old Doctor examines Shadow his hands trembling Their
eyes meet The Old Man is terrified

SHADOW
Henri it’s a set-up

Huh The Young Doctor whirls -- with a gun Henri grabs the
man’s wrist A scuffle THUD

HENRI
Merde

Henri’s eyes do funny things before he bounces off the
floor wearing a tranquilizer dart

SHADOW

Way to go Henri
Rutger -- nose-taped face horribly bruised from the castle
blast -- enters dragging two knocked-out Cops who used to

guard the hallway Stink-eyes all go to Shadow

INT HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WING CORRIDOR - VIENNA - SAME TIME

Packed Overwhelmed A frazzled Old Doctor barks at Blonde
Female Doctor to handle a Kid writhing in pain on a gurney
She hesitates then goes to the kid and we realize --

The doctor is Jade In blonde wig and glasses She examines
the kid pressing on his abdomen The Kid squirms and gasps

Jade checks her flanks rubs her hands vigorously and
spreads them just above the Kid’s stomach Holding them
there

The Kid’s face transfigures his pain is miraculously
lifted away He looks at her a fucking angel

KID
Mutter Mutter

The Kid’s Mother hurries over Jade beelines away bumping
into a Fellow Doctor studying a chart

FELLOW DOCTOR (0S)
Wie bitte

Their eyes meet A frozen moment For the Fellow Doctor is
Ghost wearing studious glasses and a second-rate mustache

GHOST
(fuck)
Nice to see you again

JADE
(motherfucker )
Such a pleasure

He notes her right hand is inside her coat likely gripping a
Chinese pistol Her stare is cold as the grave So

GHOST
What kind of doctor are you

JADE
Internal hemorrhage You

GHOST
Women’s problems

Her lips crack a millimeter

JADE
Oh you’ve got a woman problem
(then)
Let’s go somewhere quiet and
discuss a cure

But before she can lead --

GHOST
Let’s not be too hasty You need
me

JADE

I do Enlighten me

GHOST
My partner has the map you want
We get him out of here you can
have the goods

JADE
Or maybe you have the goods

GHOST
(chuckles )
If I did I’d be sea-side in Spain
sipping sangria Senorita

Rutger exits the elevator down the corridor pushing a wheel-
chair with a drugged Shadow in it The Muscular Nurse and
the Young Doctor follow all of them heading for the exit

Ghost and Jade trail Too many cops and civilians here to do
anything Shadow is loaded into an ambulance and it speeds
off

Ghost and Jade trade a look then --

INT STOLEN MERCEDES - DRIVING - DAY

Ghost drives tailing the ambulance Jade beside him gun
vaguely pointed in his direction His eyes are sucked
towards her beautiful legs She catches him

JADE
Eyes on the target
GHOST
Always
(then)

Who exactly do you work for

JADE
No one you’ve heard of

GHOST
You’re very determined They must
be paying you a lot

JADE
They pay me nothing

He looks at her Intriguing

GHOST
So you actually believe this
Spear has special powers too

JADE
Don’t know Don’t care My order
took an oath to protect Khan’s
tomb and that’s what we’ve done
for a thousand years

GHOST
No shit Me and Shadow kind of
belong to an order too Doesn’t go
back quite a thousand years but
our foster father Coogan God rest
his soul ran a home for lost kids
(MORE )

GHOST (CONTD)
He taught us the craft and a code
to go with it

JADE
How honorable

GHOST
Well strangely it is

JADE
If your mind wasn’t so small and
greedy maybe I’d try and explain
the bigger picture to you

GHOST
Small-minded perhaps and with a
weak-spot for assertive women but
not greedy I’m happy to cut you
in as a partner

JADE
Partner

She punches him with stunning force and steadies the wheel
as he wallows shaking out stars Very casually she adds --

JADE (CONTD)
You work for me now and if I don’t
like something I kill you

GHOST
(feeling his jaw)
Sounds fair

EXT INDUSTRIAL AREA - DUSK

Huge construction vehicles are parked here Ghost and Jade
watch from a distance as the ambulance enters a warehouse
Scions guard the entrance

JADE
Well wait for the dark then slip
in and kill them all

GHOST
Whoa Sounds like a lot of work
Besides I’m a thief not a ninja

JADE
You have a better idea

GHOST
Yeah A simple smash and grab
(she stares)
I do this for a living
(she stares)
Trust me

JADE

I wouldn’t trust you with a turkey
sandwich

INT WAREHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Shadow strapped in his hospital bed Rutger and another
Scion tape a floor-tarp around the bed Uh-oh

A DOOR BOOMS somewhere the CLICK-CLACK of shoes build
pulling a handful of Scions to attention

SHADOW’S POV as the rafters are replaced by Rausch’s pinched
face His eyes bleeding internally from the castle blast
have turned devil-red He dabs at them

RAUSCH
Tears of blood like Jesus

SHADOW
Ive felt better myself

RAUSCH
You will never feel better

Rausch very methodically dons surgical gloves
SHADOW
Look you’re in a helluva tight

spot here Rausch

He says this as if he were in charge and not strapped
helplessly to a bed

SHADOW (CONTD)
but I see no reason this can’t
work out great for everyone

A surgery apron is tied around Rausch

SHADOW (CONTD)
I’m willing to offer you a deal

Rausch dons a plastic face-shield to guard against spatter

RAUSCH
Very American of you Here’s what
I can offer

He whips the cover of a tray filled with chilling instruments
of torture perfected over the centuries And Shadow plays
it cool but his speech is a tad too fast --

SHADOW

An eloquent counter I’1l give you
that Problem is you can’t trust
what anyone says under torture
Just ask my government

(then)
I’m the only one who can retrieve
the map and stone Make a deal
shake my hand and you can take it
to the bank Right now

Rausch grins

RAUSCH
We have a long history of
extracting the truth You’re going
to bare your soul as I keep you on
the razor’s edge of life The pain
will be so profound you will
violently beg me for the relief of
death

Shadow’s mask begins to crumble he speaks even faster

SHADOW
You’re emotional Acting contrary
to your objective It’s why your
people lost the war

RAUSCH
Our war never ended But it will
once I have the Spear of Destiny

Rausch looks over his torture instruments Where to begin

RAUSCH (CONT’D)
(to Rutger)
Aussetzen seinen anus

And whatever he said Shadow caught the operative last word
and starts to trash and kick as Rutger and another Scion
unstrap his legs And force them apart

Rausch holds a chilling contraption Torquemada-ancient
sharp-pronged Christ they’re going to put that horrible
thing inside Shadow And what Disembowel him

Suddenly a TINY RATTLE issues from the tray of instruments
before Rausch Just enough to catch his attention Strange
The RATTLING BUILDS

And it’s undeniable now Something is happening His eyes
cut to Shadow Is he doing this somehow

The RATTLING BUILDS
Instruments on the tray CHATTER MADLY

RAUSCH (CONT’D)
Tut er das

The whole goddamned place is starting to SHAKE Rausch’s eyes
flick What is happening

And all of Ghost’s talk about divine intervention echoes back
at Shadow

SHADOW
Reckoning Day

THE SIDE OF THE WAREHOUSE EXPLODES as 258 tons of steel burst
through it with a CLAP OF DIESEL THUNDER It’s a LeTourneau
L-2350 biggest earth mover in the solar system

It ROARS directly towards Shadow’s bed scattering Rausch and
minions the hell out of its 2300 horsepower charge

It’s colossal loader scoops up Shadow’s bed on the fly and
continues on it’s THUNDERING PATH

RIGHT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAREHOUSE and out
into the night Three seconds in all

And it takes Rausch a full second to recover then --

RAUSCH
SCHNAPPT SIE SCHNAPPT SIE

Rutger and the Scions take off in pursuit

EXT WAREHOUSE - OUTSKIRTS OF VIENNA - NIGHT

The LeTourneau SHAKING THE NIGHT as it charges through the
parking lot flattening some of the Scion’s vehicles as if
they were made of balsa wood

then swerving onto a long industrial driveway trailing
Rausch’s men who run flat-out firing guns

RUTGER
(shouting in German)
Dont shoot We need them alive

INSIDE THE LOADER

Shadow frees himself from his bed Climbs up the side of the
cavernous loader in his hospital gown

crabs along the wide loader-arms towards the cab With a
last Cirque De Solei jump he’s there and tears the cab door
open Ghost still in his doctor’s frock smiles

GHOST
How’s that for a house call

SHADOW
Subtle as always

GHOST
You’re welcome
INT LETOURNEAU CAB - CONTINUOUS
Shadow climbs in and sees Jade in the back of the dark cab

GHOST
Shadow Jade Jade Shadow

She gives a friendly wave with the gun

JADE
How did you find Nazi hospitality

SHADOW
A little cloying

He looks at Ghost ‘what the fuck is she doing here’

JADE
You work for me now

SHADOW
Sounds good You’re the most
beautiful damsel that’s come to my
distress

JADE
Your distress is just beginning

She cocks the gun but there’s no time to get into it as --

AN SUV ROARS UP ON THEIR FLANK Scions hanging off it like
Apaches about to jump a stagecoach

Ghost cuts the wheel

INTERCUT EXT LETOURNEAU - SAME TIME

aS it swerves off the road onto a vast hard-scrabble
surface some Austrian Trump is turning into a mall

The LeTourneau is handicapped in speed but every time the
quicker SUV comes in to deposit it’s warriors Ghost swerves
and those 12-foot tires almost flatten the car

CUT TO

INSIDE THE LE TOURNEAU

GHOST
They’re gonna board us from behind
(to Jade)
Maybe get out there and use that
gun

She considers then --
JADE
(to Shadow)

You with me

SHADOW
I’m really not dressed for it

He is after all still in his bare-ass hospital gown
JADE
Maybe the sight of your pigu will
scare them away

She points the gun at him ‘go’

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE LETOURNEAU

The Scion’s SUV pulls behind dwarfed by the colossal
vehicle

Two Muscular Scions manage to jump onto the LeTourneau’s rear
and pull themselves up SHOTS RING out and a Scion tumbles
away in the Loader’s wake It’s --

Jade perched on the superstructure above hair whipping in
the wind She FIRES ON THE SECOND SCION and --

BULLET TIME as the 45 round streaks for the Second Scion
whose hands THRUST OUT SEEMINGLY DEFLECTING THE BULLET
AROUND HIMSELF BY MILLIMETERS

He rolls flicks a hooked-blade that swishes right at JADES
THROAT but she arches back at an impossible angle and the
BLADE SWISHES PAST HER CHIN nicking skin

And before she can fully recover he is on her The gun
tumbles as the two of them slam together in hand-to-hand
battle so swift and balletic it defies the laws of physics
and --

A mesmerized Shadow backpedals heading back to the cab as --

Rutger jumps from the SUV dangling momentarily from an
engine vane next to the huge tires He pulls himself up
works his way along the vanes towards the superstructure

The Muscular Scion gets Jade in a choke-hold His arm may as
well be a hydraulic vice There is no way out of it She
reaches back placing her hands on the Scions’ temples And
drives all the mysterious Chi she possesses through them

The Scion’s nose begins to fountain blood it drips from his
eyes that roll and bulge wildly like a dying steer His grip
loosens and she’s free -- leg snapping out of a coiled spin
to whip him across the head and he tumbles down the steel
mountain and is swallowed under a massive tire

Rutger reaches the cab rips the door open Empty Huh A
shoe is wedged under the gas pedal keeping it floored

Jade having recovered her gun scrabbles towards the cab
when she spots --

Ghost and Shadow having jumped off the loader running the
hell away into the dark Fuck that

About to leap off Jade sees the SUV racing alongside to
deposit two more Scions As they jump on she jumps off --

landing on SUV’s roof firing a double-tap through it
taking out the Driver at the same moment as --

Rutger realizes he’s brilliantly colonized a now useless hunk
of slow moving steel

RUTGER
SHEISSE

He jumps in the cab and turns the Loader around and now --
GHOST AND SHADOW

The former with one shoe running flat-out as they’re pursued
by the speedy SUV and THUNDERING LeTourneau

SHADOW
You coulda been free ‘n clear in
Spain What’s wrong with you

GHOST
I must be concussed from the blast

SHADOW
Or there’s just no end to your
stupidity We had a pact

GHOST
Please I’m embarrassed enough
SHADOW
Don’t ever think I’1ll do the same
for you
GHOST

Wouldn’t dream of it
Shadow glances behind and sees the SUV closing distance
SHADOW
For the life of me I can’t figure

out if we’re blessed or cursed

GHOST
We’re about to find out

And they crest the edge of the construction site and just
below as if by the grace of God --

A LITTLE CONSTRUCTION BARRACKS
With several cars parked and praise the Lord an idling BMW
GHOST (CONTD)
What’d I tell ya God loves us
GOD FUCKING LOVES US

As it flies over the little ridge and bounces down towards
the BMW that’s SCREECHING away

Ghost drives Shadow eyes Jade’s headlights tailing them

SHADOW
God seems to love her too

GHOST
I’m not worried
(then)
Figure out how to use that GPS
Hamid is waiting in Muggendorf

Shadow leans forward and a BULLET rips through the seat where
his head was a moment ago He ducks deep Ghost doesn’t

SHADOW
Get down stupid

Ghost looks at him seemingly in a state of grace
GHOST
Don’t you get it already We’re on
a divine mission We couldn’t die
if we tried

MORE BULLETS ZING Seat stuffing flies Shadow is curled
flat in the wheel well but Ghost sits tall in his faith

SHADOW
You just jinxed us

He floors the pedal and the huge engine spools up and as we
anticipate the greatest chase ever Ghost SLAMS THE BRAKES
INT JADE’S CAR —- SAME TIME

Jade plows into the BMW her vehicle folding like origami
The windshield explodes The car is thrown

EXT ROADWAY - SAME TIME

Jades car careens settling upside down in the ditch The

GHOST
She hit hard

SHADOW
Hopefully she’s not okay

Ghost exits the BMW

don’t owe her anything

Ghost treks back sees Jade crawling out of the wreck

GHOST
You all right

She barely manages to lift her gun

GHOST (CONT’D)
Ill take that as a ‘yes’

and she aims with shaky hands He remains unflappable

GHOST (CONT’D)
For what it’s worth you’re the
most stunning women I’ve ever met

She PULLS THE TRIGGER CLICK

GHOST (CONTD)

And he heads off Jade crawls out of the ditch onto the
roadway seeing the fading BMW It’s over No never She
digs out her cracked cell phone Dials

A short comical Austrian shuffles towards Henri from the
little control tower The great French manhunter peers down
his nose as the little man spills about the recently departed
Dassault Falcon and the fugitives that abandoned the BMW

Henri’s lizard eyes pinch to the horizon and he exposes a
palm On cue a minion places a cell-phone in it

HAMID

Before we build any bronze statues

shall we see if it’s real
Ghost reaches into his sock for the map and Star of Asia and
places it on the table The latter catches the sun through
the windows spinning fantastic patterns around the cabin
Hamid licks his lips wipes his hands cracks his fingers
And the three of them gather around the table as Hamid
orients the map North with the aid of a little compass

He takes the beautiful stone placing it in the center of the
sphere with its mysterious symbols

HAMID (CONTD)

She digs out a little hand-mirror from a pocket

HAMID (CONTD)
Light must be directly overhead

He angles the sun through the windows at ninety degrees
They hold their breath Nothing Doubt creeps in

SHADOW
Shouldn’t somethin’ be happening

Wait the stone fills with an ethereal glow all the light
concentrating itself into three thin perfect shafts of
light which point to separate symbols on the map

A flying dragon A serpent fish An archer

Hamid stares A religious moment

GHOST
What does it mean

Hamid’s eyes slowly flutter up and fix on Ghost

HAMID
It means I am sorry

GHOST
Sorry Why are you --

Ghost turns to Shadow who’s looking at Aisha who’s
looking back at him with a beautiful stainless silenced 9mm
Behind her --

Neema and Aisha point equally stunning pistols at Ghost A
frozen moment then --

GHOST
What the hell is this

SHADOW
It’s called a double-cross Look
it up

Shadow lunges grabbing Aisha’s gun She twists elbows him
in the face knees him in the groin and drops him like a sack
of shit All guns now point at Ghost

GHOST
Awww come on Hamid

Hamid pockets the loot

HAMID
Terribly sorry Ghost I can’t
help it I was never good at
sharing Ask my wives

GHOST
You’re not seeing the bigger
picture here friendo --

HAMID
Im almost fifty years-old My
whole life I’ve lived in the shadow
of kings Men whose intellect
couldn’t fill my shoes TI also

GHOST
Did you hear what I said earlier
You’re messing with God’s will

HAMID
Yes that is why to please God I am
going to take over your mission and
spare your life

But now I’m afraid I must ask you
to leave my plane friend

Sort of like that
And he looks at the Chinese captain CHENG behind the desk
salt-of-the-sea grey streaks and weary eyes Behind him are
shelves full of books

See anything like it before

He throws Henri the Arab fuck you and strides away

Following in a car and as Hamid turns the corner she
speeds up about to make her move but --

A VAN SCREECHES in front of Hamid and he’s snatched off the
street The Van speeds away and Jade cusses then follows

Nice to see you too Mr Rausch
How have you been

We now see Hamid hanging upside down from a gimbal a rope
around his ankles

RAUSCH
So-so And you

HAMID
To be honest things have been a
bit up and down

Rausch nods sympatico then --

RAUSCH
Maybe I can straighten things out

And he peels back a sheet revealing his chilling instruments
of persuasion on a tray

HAMID
(swallows heavily)
Quite unnecessary I have given
your men the stone and the map
In fact I was on my way to call
you when your men graciously
offered me a ride

RAUSCH
(re map and stone)
You intended to return this to me

HAMID
Of course For a small finders
fee if you were so inclined

RAUSCH
I would’ve been inclined But now
youre quite inclined obviously

Rausch chuckles Hamid chuckles harder -- through his sweat

RAUSCH (CONT’D)
And how do I know this is the real
map or even the only map

HAMID
(gravely insulted)
Because I am Hamid Abdul Aziz My
word is my bond

Probably not

GHOST
Well haven’t found a good enough
reason to die yet

JADE
Maybe we’ll find one together

Told you we were being watched
didn’t I You never listen

Not my people They’re government
agents wondering why two men who
are not Bill Gates and Steve

I know you probably think less of
us but there wasn’t time for a
better cover We ran into Gates

Which gives us maybe a tiny head
start

going to offer you a deal

I get the Spear of Destiny you can
have everything else

touching Where are we going

We’ll show you

Were up high over the rural Northwest of China green and
mountainous and mysterious to the horizon

An old retired Harbin Z-5 helicopter flashes past
descending into the rumpled green shag

EXT MOUNTAINS NEAR PANJIAKOU - TWO HOURS LATER

It’s not quite jungle but the vegetation’s uncooperative and
untraveled Ghost and Shadow on the point lumber past
followed by Jade and TWO MEN from her order They all wear
backpacks

Shadow drinks from his canteen eyeing Jade and her Men --
their bodies and faces forged out of steel Killers

SHADOW
(Low)
The moment they get the spear
they’re gonna snuff us

GHOST
Of course
SHADOW
So you have a plan
GHOST

I’m thinking God has a plan
He just smiles enigmatic then --

GHOST (CONT’D)
(Jade)
Oy

He points to a low section of crumbled and partially
overgrown wall directly ahead

GHOST (CONT’D)
The lost part of the Great Wall

Jade studies it

GHOST (CONTD)
Did you know your greatest landmark
was partially built by thieves and
criminals Ditto for the pyramids

JADE
It must make you very proud

And she gazes up the slope of the crumbled wall that leads
to the gaping mouth of a limestone cave She yells something
in Mandarin to the Three Men They seem to concur

GHOST
Yep that’s what I was thinking
great place for a tomb

INT LIMESTONE CAVE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Flashlights finger the darkness the DRIP of moisture
Ghost Shadow and the others steal forward They reach what
could once have been stairs or maybe it’s just the way time
shaped the limestone

They pause here seized by the feeling they’re about to cross
some Rubicon Jade waves at the Three Men who split off and
take up positions guarding the mouth of the cave

GHOST
Do your people like booby traps

JADE
We didn’t build the tomb

GHOST
I guess I’1l go first then

No one complains He starts up the stairs which led to an
open space something that almost looks as if were crafted
The WIND through here sounds like some colossus BREATHING

SHADOW
Hold up

Ghost turns in direction of Shadow’s flashlight Bones All
crushed flat

SHADOW (CONT’D)
I’m thinking some kind of
counterweight deadfall

GHOST
With a reset mechanism

Shadow shines his flashlight about

SHADOW
Trigger’s gotta be in the floor

GHOST
Un-huh What would you set it for

SHADOW
Seventy pounds That would take
care of most able humans

Ghost bends with the flashlight studying animal tracks in the
dust He sees the large paw prints of a leopard Measure it
with his hand

GHOST
Jungle cat with five inch paws
would weigh over seventy

SHADOW
Even anorexic

Jade looks from one to the other two men fully in their
element

GHOST
Here’s our path then

He starts keeping to the leopard’s tracks one careful
step after another A snake slithers past DRIPPING WATER
ECHOES -- a dirge that seems to increase as they advance

JADE
There’s something ahead

A dull gleam like an old eye watching them from the
darkness They draw closer and it is an eye a giant
emerald set into a snarling dragon carved into the moldering
stone On the other side of the dragon’s face is just a
dark eye socket It is a test of sorts

JADE (CONT’D)
The eyes are the path to the soul

She reaches Ghost stops her

GHOST
Those who only have eyes for
riches misses lifes true
treasures

SHADOW
Did you just make that up

GHOST
It was written on the back of that
Munch painting we borrowed in Oslo

SHADOW
What’s that got to do with this

GHOST
Maybe everything weve ever done
has to do with this

They hesitate Suddenly Jade turns abruptly staring out
the mouth of the cave behind them Her senses tuned to
something out there

SHADOW
What

Her eyes draw back and flick to Shadow

JADE
Hurry up

Ghost reaches up to the empty eye socket hesitating

SHADOW
Go on I’m sure it’s fine

GHOST
If there’s a snake in there I’m
going to be real pissed

He reaches in fumbling His expression changes
Something there He pulls it out an old rope

A DEEP RUMBLE ECHOES AROUND THEM

GHOST (CONTD)
Shit --
and they leap back throwing themselves down as heavy
things SWISH about them with deadly efficiency Dust
swirls and when it settles

A slab in the stone floor has retreated revealing crude
stone-stairs that vanish into the subterranean depths

EXT LIMESTONE CAVE - SAME TIME

A leaf parts -- an ice-blue eye stares through us The face
emerges Rausch He looks down

Ghost Shadow and the others’ boot prints in the dust He
turns hand-signaling to Rutger who grips a machine gun

INT KHAN’S TOMB - MOMENTS LATER

Ghost Shadow and Jade inch down the stairs flashlights
sweeping They arrive at the bottom and go slack-jawed

Skeletons like two shimmering isoclines form a path into
the murky cathedral

SHADOW
Ladies first

JADE
Very chivalrous

Skeletons grin at Jade as she moves deeper into the chamber
On a dais of massive stone blocks is an ornate coffin
guarded by towering terra-cotta warriors

They pick their way to it passing chests filled with gold
figurines bracelets coins Emeralds big as golf-balls

And there are hundreds of chests ringing Khan’s resting
place Billions in treasure Shadow drools

JADE (CONTD)
How does grave-robbing jibe with
your honorable thieves spiel

SHADOW
Easily If more than two hundred
years have passed it’s called
archeology not grave robbing

Shadow picks up a massive diamond falling into its beauty

JADE
The spear first

Their eyes lock He keeps her in his sights As does she
with both men They finally arrive at

THE DAIS
and circle Khan’s dusty coffin They try to open it but
it won’t budge and the reason is clear -- their hands have
wiped 800 hundred years off grime from the lid revealing
it’s made of gold
SHADOW

Probably took all those dead monks

to get this lid on here
It hangs there when GUNFIRE ECHOES from the cave above

GHOST
Our favorite Nazi

They listen A blistering fire-fight erupts

JADE
We’1ll have to deal with him first

GHOST
We’re lovers not fighters We’1l
get this thing open and meet you up
top
She doesn’t move

SHADOW
There’s only one way out right

The sounds of BATTLE RATCHET UP

GHOST
You have our word
INT EXT LIMESTONE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER
The two Monks are crouched returning fire They set off
little rockets that whizz outside and belch a thick blanket

of smoke

Inbound tracer rounds zips around the cave as Jade picks her
way to the cave-mouth

RAUSCH

Ducked safely behind a boulder as a pall of smoke blankets
the battlefield He yells at --

Rutger who crawls within pitching distance of the cave-mouth
and lobs a grenade

that lands between Jade and her men She casually
strides to the grenade and throws it back

BOOM

INT KHAN’S TOMB - SAME TIME

Ghost and Shadow puzzle over the sarcophagus

A little c4 a little TNT

What are we mouth-breathers All
we need is a bit of leverage

His eyes settle on the terra-cotta warriors and the long
staffs they hold

GHOST (CONT’D)
Are those staffs wood or iron

SHADOW
(checks it out)
Wood Useless

Ghost’s eyes settle on the head terra-cotta warrior standing
at the head of the sarcophagus And slowly it dawns

he drifts forward The warrior gazes down at him
gripping a nine-foot staff atop which is affixed a familiar-
looking object

Ghost works the staff loose blows the eons of dust off the
spear-tip It’s rusted and pitted Unimpressive Yet it
is --

THE SPEAR OF DESTINY
Ghost and Shadow’s eyes meet

SHADOW (CONTD)
That’s it

GHOST
That’s it

Prickly silence

SHADOW
So how does it work close your
eyes and make a wish Rub it

Ghost runs his fingers over the rust Nothing happens He
closes his eyes trying to channel it’s power Nothing
It’s all terribly anti-climactic

SHADOW (CONTD)
Tiger dick

Ghost swishes the spear around refusing to believe it
Still nothing happens

SHADOW (CONTD)

Let’s fill our bags with some nice
trinkets and get the fuck out

INT EXT LIMESTONE CAVE - MINUTES LATER
Thick smoke wafts Tracer rounds blip through it bouncing
around the cave with crazy sounds Ghost and Shadow hefting

a heavy bag of treasure emerge and pick their way ahead

Slumped behind a boulder one of Jade’s men badly shot up
but still fighting on fumes

SHADOW
Christ how many of them

The man shrugs

GHOST
Jade

He throws his eyes Jade slumped on a pile of rocks Dead
from the looks of it

The Man mumbles hands Ghost his rifle and dies After a
long beat --

GHOST (CONTD)
I’m not worried You worried

SHADOW
Why would I be worried
GHOST
Good If you were worried Id be
worried
SHADOW
Ill get us out of here
GHOST
Of course Like always
SHADOW
That’s right
GHOST
So
SHADOW

It’s simple Obvious

GHOST
I’m probably just tired

SHADOW
We make like mice into that smoke
and slip away

They stare outside Grim How many are waiting out there

They start keeping to the walls They pass the second the
dead man and Ghost takes his SKS rifle

AT THE CAVE MOUTH

They huddle Silence The smoke like a dense fog Guns on
the ready they inch out Keeping low So far so good

A shadow flits through the fog ahead of them and another
Rausch’s men bounding They freeze a pressing silence

More shadows at the edge of visibility creep and vanish
Still good they move Then a SCION materializes right in
front of them as stunned as they are

Both parties squirt back opening fire and in a split second
it seems every gun in the world is firing

Bullets THUD and ZING as Ghost and Shadow beat it back to the
cave and dive for cover

GHOST
Youre shot

He is bleeding from his flank

SHADOW
So are you

Ghost realizes blood is roaring down his arm The barrage of
bullets never lets up thudding and zinging around them

GHOST
I’m not worried

SHADOW
They’1l run out of ammo soon

SHADOW (CONT’D)
Yeah no way they could’ve carried
much all the way up here
FLASH TO a huge ammo crate is plopped down from which

Rutger and several other Scions reload to the gills There’s
even an RPG

BACK TO
GHOST AND SHADOW
The bullets keep coming relentless pinning them down

SHADOW (CONT’D)
No way they can keep that up

GHOST
Something will come along

SHADOW
It always does

They bleed and wait Then SHOUTS in the fog

GHOST
Are they closing on us

SHADOW
Nah they know we’re armed
They’1l wait us out

FLASH TO Scions in the lifting fog and there’s got to be
thirty of them They’re like a noose closing around the cave-
mouth with a cold giddy Rausch quarterbacking

BACK TO

GHOST AND SHADOW
Growing weaker in will and body The writing is on the wall

GHOST
We shouldn’t be cowering

SHADOW
We’re not cowering we’re
strategizing

GHOST
We should attack

And it’s clear what he’s saying Blaze of glory time

SHADOW
Use the element of surprise

GHOST
Exactly

A beat

GHOST (CONT’D)
Hey we can hold our heads high
We pulled the greatest job there
ever was

GHOST (CONTD)
Our Ninth Symphony

SHADOW
No one can take that from us

Shadow’s eyes flicker Fading Ghost helps him up

GHOST
Ill lead

SHADOW
Ill lead

Ghost is hit in the gut and thuds on his ass Stunned he
looks at the blood roaring out of him Shadow frozen
momentarily then he’s hit in the shoulder and spun

Their eyes meet and it’s undeniable now

With what little strength he has left he grabs the spear
from Ghost and starts smashing it with a rock

GHOST
What are you doing

SHADOW
Making sure that Nazi sonofabitch
doesn’t get what he came for

He hammers away Blood trickling down his arm onto the
crumpling spear-tip Blood rock and iron mixing

GHOST
Shadow
He’s felt it He looks up a strand of hair rising on his
head Then another STATIC ELECTRICITY ripples across him
Ghost points the blood from Shadow’s shoulder levitates

Then drifts upwards into the darkness off the cave

THE SPEAR TIP tiny filaments in the iron beginning to
glow turning into bright tendrils

- which curl heavenwards meeting a column of energy
coming down and the AIR CRACKLES WITH ELECTRICITY
Suddenly Shadow is GLOWING

His ENERGY sparking into Ghost lifting him off the ground
and from him to Jade and to her dead warriors -- all of them
shining and levitating like constellations

And Shadow in rapture as images whirl around him all of
human history flashing by faster and faster and --

His veins throb madly blood-vessels spider-webbing

The GLOW TURNS WHITE HOT and he SCREAMS appearing to be
incinerated

RAUSCH

Ducked behind a rock watching his men close the noose around
the cave The smoke has lifted and he’s feeling good

RUTGER
LEITER --

A blistering light radiates from the cave growing in
intensity and Rausch screams at the top of his lungs

RAUSCH
Bevegun schnell

Rutger and his men open fire with everything they’ve got
then

THEIR WEAPONS

Disassemble in their hands bolt for bolt and swirl around
them

THE LIGHT

Blinding in intensity as it forms up at the cave mouth
Shadow’s humanoid form at its core

BUSHES AND TREES

Burst into flames yet strangely are not consumed by the
fire and --

RUTGER AND THE SCIONS

Charge Shadow then scream as their eyes bubble and turn
milky like spent flashbulbs before --

SHAFTS OF LIGHT

Zip from Shadow into the men turning them into spectacular
statues of ash which crumble with the wind and now --

RAUSCH
Runs but in front of him --
THE GROUND CRACKS OPEN

Great big crevasses into the depths of hell Cut off
Rausch does the only thing he can --

Turns to the glowing face of God and throws himself supine
screaming over and over for mercy

Shadow advances the world on fire around him It’s as if he
is the pillar around which the universe moves

He lifts Rausch’s chin with the tip of the spear forcing him
to look into his eyes

RAUSCH (CONT’D)
I am at your mercy Lord

at which point Shadow holds out the spear for Rausch
Take it Rausch’s eyes flicker what is this He accepts
the spear and God’s power flows into him

He throws his head back in rapture as the spear’s energy
keeps flowing into him without stop his hunger for power
knows no limits and triumph turns to burgeoning agony

Rausch drops the spear but too late he turns into a
spectacular human inferno

Shadow dazed regards the spear on the ground draws his
foot back and KICKS IT

and the spear TUMBLES DOWN INTO A STEAMING BOTTOMLESS
CREVASSE

Shadow looks up the sky reeling and then he swoons
DISSOLVE TO
Ghost slaps Shadow’s cheeks

GHOST
Anyone home Yo

Shadow bats his eyes

GHOST (CONT’D)
Eeeyy buddy that was a hell of a
show

SHADOW
Is it over

GHOST
Is it over
(Ghost roars)
You could say that

Shadow sits up two Chinese Airforce helicopters are parked
Soldiers cordoning off the area Others pointing guns at
them

Jade and her two guys very much alive sit on the ground
shackled

SHADOW
My backpack --

GHOST
Yeah no they got all that and
were probably going to jail for
forever

SHADOW
So why the fuck are you smiling
GHOST
(beaming)
I was right -- about the spear

The Chinese soldiers yells for them to move

GHOST (CONTD)
You turned into God raised four
people from the dead and
incinerated a small Nazi army
That’s like Moses level shit

SHADOW
And what do I have to show for it

GHOST
(shaking his head)
Cup half full man cup half full

He pulls Shadow up and CLICK-CLICK they’re handcuffed and
led away

SLOW DISSOLVE

EXT THE GOBI DESERT - WEEKS LATER - DUSK

The baking heat Ghost and Shadow handcuffed together
stagger past up a dune against a red orb of dying sun

Ghost has lost his pants Shadow has no shoes

GHOST
You all right
SHADOW
Grand
GHOST
Feet are killing me Wanna swap
again

They stop Ghost exchanging his pants for Shadow’s shoes
GHOST (CONT’D)
You know we really need to talk
about it

SHADOW

GHOST
What else are we gonna talk about

SHADOW
Nothing Shut up

GHOST
If I’d held the power of God in my
hands I’d wanna share

SHADOW
I-don’t-want-to-talk-about-it

Ghost exhales They move up the dune supporting each other

GHOST
You know we did save the world

SHADOW
Not according to the Chinese

GHOST
Genius is always misunderstood

SHADOW
That I can attest to

GHOST
And as long we stick together the
world is our oyster

SHADOW
Never liked oysters

GHOST
So swap oysters for playground

They’re almost reached the top of the dune

GHOST (CONTD)
I actually have an incredible idea

SHADOW
Please don’t

GHOST
Seriously you’ll wanna hear this

SHADOW
I don’t wanna hear it really
Never Too old for this shit

GHOST
Okay suit yourself

They’re over the dune now out of sight and after a few
beats of desert silence

SHADOW (0S)
What idea

FADE OUT

THE END
