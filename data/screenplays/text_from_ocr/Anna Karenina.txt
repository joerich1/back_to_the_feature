Karenin remains at apparent ease as though unaware of
peoples glances

at Vronsky and Anna and he kisses Betsys hand Princess
Myagkaya has
meanwhile gone over to Anna Anna likes her and is glad of
the diversion

PRINCESS MYAGKAYA

bles and it was ghastly We had to ask them
back I gave them a sauce that cost eighty-
five kopeks and it was a triumph

Anna and Vronsky laugh Princess Myagkaya moves on

VRONSKY

ANNA

were guilty of something

VRONSKY

I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty
to forgive you

VRONSKY
No thats not what you want Moscow I
can do better than that Tonight I refused a
posting to Tashkent I can change my mind
and youll never see me again

ANNA
If you have any thought for me you will
give me back my peace

VRONSKY
I have no peace to give There can be no
peace for us--only misery or the greatest
happiness You are my whole life now

She looks at him and nods slowly as if in thought
Betsy diplomatically leads Karenin to Anna
BETSY

wins every argument

the Guards the Hussars and other regiments

Among them is Vronsky attended by a Trainer who is fussing

over Frou-

ful horse which must be Gladiator with Captain Makhotin

gentlemen who also

may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the
seated section

Soldiers Horse People and Locals watch from the turf

A race is flowing towards the winning post with
accompanying crowd reac-

tion but it is clear from Annas detachment exchanging
chat with Betsy

that this is not Vronskys race

KARENIN

--looks up to the ladies stand Betsy smiles at him in
greeting but Anna
seems unaware

Countess Vronsky appraises the young princess
COUNTESS VRONSKY

Exquisite creature you really ought to be
the spoil of victory today

glasses towards
the Starting Post

further

down the course-- and to the ambulance wagon (with a red
cross sewn

on it)

EXT STARTING POST THE RACES SAME TIME--DAY

The riders line up and theyre off

VRONSKYS POV

The stands and spectators are distant the first fence
coming at him horses

on either side His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-
Frou is clear with

Gladiator half a length in front The next fence is coming
up Gladiator

and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls
badly

EXT LADIES STAND THE RACES SAME TIME--DAY

Spectators on either side of Anna and those behind and in
front collectively react

KARENIN SEES THAT

Anna reacts not at all Her gaze through her glasses stays
unwavering

on Vronsky Karenin notes this and from then on his
attention is fixed on

Anna When the horses come opposite the stand she lowers
her glasses and

follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator

VRONSKY

-- eases Frou-Frou past Gladiator The horses take the next
jump
LADIES STAND
With one hand Anna grips her folded fan

Karenins face is a mask as he watches Anna unconsciously
half-destroying
it She raises her glasses

ANNAS POV THROUGH GLASSES

Frou-Frou approaches the last fence with Gladiator half a
length behind
on the near side to Anna

VRONSKY

-- working the reins rising and falling in rhythm with the
horse looks

ahead to the winning post and before knowing it he makes an
error losing

the rhythm dropping back into the saddle and raising the
horses head just

as Frou-Frou takes off

ANNAS POV (THROUGH GLASSES)

Frou-Frou rises Gladiator rises Frou-Frou disappears
Gladiator clears

the fence in Annas foreground Simultaneously there are
shrieks and

exclamations all around her-- OFF CAMERA-- and the view
through

the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou impeded by
horses jumping the

fence

She lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground
rolling over and
Vronsky on the ground

COUNTESS VRONSKY

-- sees this too her mouth set tight with contempt
KARENIN

--looks shocked Almost in the same moment he hears Annas
anguished

cry conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowds
exclamation

ANNA
Alexei

KARENIN
Im here

This is adroit He comes down several steps and pushes
through to offer his arm

but Anna has lost control trying to escape like a bird
beating against its cage

KARENIN (CONTD)
Would you like to leave

Anna ignores him puts her glasses to her eyes searching
out Vronsky

ON THE COURSE

Vronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and in
terrible recrimina-

tion tries to pull Frou-Frou to her feet by the reins
Frou-Frou struggles

to get up but her back is broken Officials officers and a
doctor have come

running

ANNA

sees an Officer hurrying to the Imperial party to
report

ANNA
Stiva What are they saying

OBLONSKY
Vronskys unhurt--but the horse

Anna relapses into sobs attempting to hide her face behind
her destroyed
fan Betsy gives Anna her fan
VRONSKY
--is restrained by an Officer

OFFICER
Her backs broken

The Officer takes a pistol from his holster Vronsky
enraged and in grief
takes the pistol from him

KARENIN
--persists with Anna

KARENIN
Im asking you if you wish to go

He touches Annas arm She jerks it away

ANNA
No leave me alone

BETSY
Ill bring her home Alexei

KARENIN

(SMILING POLITELY)
Excuse me Princess but Anna is not well
and I want her to come with me

A gunshot is heard from the course Anna turns her tear-
streaked face
towards it

INT MOVING COACH--DAY

Annas hysteria has solidified into a blank despair Karenin
seems to want
to pretend that nothing important has happened

KARENIN
You know they say the Emperor dis-
approves of the races the danger of

injury but I
Anna looks at him contemptuously

ANNA
What

KARENIN
Im saying there is a value in manly sport
for the military--

ANNA
I dont understand

KARENIN
In my opinion its not the sport itself thats
wrong its the spectacle its making a cruel
spectacle out of--

ANNA
What are you talking about

Karenin changes tack

KARENIN
I have to tell you--

ANNA
Yes

KARENIN
I have to tell you you behaved improperly
today

ANNA

And how was that

She has raised her voice He raises a warning finger
reaches to close the
communication window behind the coachmans box

KARENIN
By making plain your feelings when one of
the riders fell Your conduct was improper
It must not occur again I have said it before

Anna smiles faintly He is misled by that

and

KARENIN (CONTD)
You are going to say my concern is unneces-
sary and ridiculous You are my wife I am
wrong to think that yes--perhaps I was
mistaken

Anna looks at him despairingly

ANNA
No you were not mistaken I love him I
am his mistress I cant bear you Im afraid
of you I hate you Do what you like to me

Karenin is literally winded--gasping for breath slowly
getting his breath-
ing under control Anna huddles away from him in her corner

Karenin

recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock-still
looking at nothing

not moving

The coach lurches unbalancing him so that he is pushed

against Anna He
recoils as if from a contamination

The coach slows The coach stops A Servant comes to the
coach door opens
the door

KARENIN
Wait please Move away

The Servant backs off

KARENIN (CONTD)
I will not have a scandal Therefore You
will not see this man again You will
behave in such a way that nothing is known
against you by society or by the servants
In return you will keep the privileges of a

wife--and the duties Tomorrow you will
return home That is all

Anna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze

EXT MAZE--NIGHT
Anna comes to Vronsky She is still shaken by the showdown
with

Karenin in his coach but is now overtaken by concern for
Vronsky after his

fall

ANNA
Are you hurt

Vronsky shakes his head He is moved by the sight of her
full of love and

desire but in her embrace he detects something new a
nervous exaltation

VRONSKY
Whats happened

ANNA
I told him Im your mistress

Vronsky lifts her face strokes her cheek He waits

ANNA (CONTD)
He thinks I can give you up and go on
living

He embraces her for that relieved grateful loving--
understanding that
she is not going to give him up

VRONSKY
No you cannot

You Petersburgers think yourselves so de
bon ton compared with dull old-fashioned

Moscow but we know how to do things--
only the other day I hear Vasya Pryachnikov
fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him

Oblonskky attempts to divert the conversation

OBLONSKY
Well whats this government commission
Karenin

But Karenin ignores him Oblonsky looks on helplessly

KARENIN
What was the challenge about

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY
Pryachnikovs wife naturally

PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY
It was a matter of honour defending a
womans honour

Karenin remains cool

KARENIN
It sounds like barbarism to me And
what if the lover had killed the husband--
would that have preserved the wifes honour
too
COUNTESS NORDSTON
Still not many of us can say that our lover
died for love

KARENIN
Love Thou shall not covet thy neighbours wife

COUNTESS NORDSTON
Would you die for love Konstantin Dmitrich

LEVIN
I would But not for my neighbours wife

Levin is nettled to find that he seems to have made a joke
for the Countess

especially Kitty remains serious watching Levin loving
him

LEVIN (CONTD)
An impure love is not love to me To admire
another mans wife is a pleasant thing but
sensual desire indulged for its own sake is
greed a kind of gluttony and a misuse of
something sacred which is given to us so
that we may choose the one person with
whom to fulfill our humanness Otherwise
we might as well be cattle

COUNTESS NORDSTON
Ah an idealist

Reconciliatory laughter eases the atmosphere Levin feels
abashed at coming

out of his shell He steals a glance at Kitty and finds her
looking at him

She smiles at him and drops her eyes

her It was Anna who taught me that

KARENIN
I do not wish to forgive I am not a cruel
man I have never hated anyone But I hate
her with all my soul for all the wrong she
has done me

row DNMN

her note
MICHAEL
Count Vronsky had already left Your Excel-
lency He took a cab to the station to the

Countess

INT LOCAL TRAIN--DAY
Anna clutches her red bag to her sitting among passengers

Anna looks about her Across the carriage she sees through
the window that

her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next
line

She looks at the windows of the other train going by
seeing the pas-
sengers inside

Unexpectedly she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky
sitting opposite
a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina

Annas body jerks involuntarily She half rises The image
however is
brief and is borne away as her own train goes by
accelerating The win-
dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind--

And then she has the same illusion again-- a Vronsky and a
Sorokina

glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the
instant

Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window where the
windows

of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic)
manner of pro-

jected film-frames and she sees Vronskys and Sorokinas
flashing by at
gathering speed And then the train has gone and theres
nothing going by
but the view

Anna collapses into the nearest seat

EXT LOCAL STATION SAME TIME--DAY
The train arrives at a small station

Anna steps down from the train The platform is well
populated by people

waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving
passengers There is an

energy about the people-- shouting laughter movement
Porters shout for

custom A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely
directly at her

but they pass by ignoring her

Anna pauses bewildered lost not knowing what to do next

She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform recognising
his distinctive
livery a cockade in his hat

ANNA
Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina

COACHMAN
No Your Excellency both princesses are at

the house of Countess Vronsky Im waiting
FOR HIM--

Anna turns back agitated expecting Vronsky to appear but
what comes

is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a
dress shop

Anna walks away along the platform impeded by people going
by her

aware that some are staring at her as she passes A Boy
selling drinks grins

at her A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a
bespectacled man

off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent
and look at her She
increases her pace She hurries away towards the far end of
the platform

Beyond her a goods train is slowly approaching Between her
and the train

two Maidservants are walking towards her They turn their
heads to look

at her remarking on her dress

MAIDSERVANT
Look at that lace on her

There is a rough bench near the end of the platform Anna
reaches it and

sits down The two girls turn again to look back at her and
are struck

by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile The goods
train reaches her

and the first wagon goes past her The two girls stop and
watch vaguely

puzzled by her

As they watch the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and
walks the

few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the
path of the train

disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the
wagons

by Kittys palm under his head Kitty squeezes a sponge over

EXT FLOWERING MEADOW--DAY

SPRINGTIME

Baby Anya old enough to stagger on her feet wavers through
wild flowers
half her height She falls over almost disappearing

This is being watched with a mixture more pleasure than
pain by Kar-
enin He is in early retirement sitting with a book ina
garden seat dressed
comfortably under a straw hat There is the SOUND OVER of
people
playing croquet

Serozha aged ten enters his view going to Anya to haul
her upright and

keeping hold of her hand as she staggers on Karenins
pleasure increases

slightly

OVER this the growing SOUND of a battlefield

EXT BATTLEFIELD (BALKANS) --DAY
CLOSE

Vronsky in an unfamiliar uniform sabre pointing forward
is mounted at

full gallop with the SOUND of the charge all around him in
the smoke and

noise of guns Something heavy and invisible with its own
SOUND--like

the flap of an awning--takes him from his horse into the air
and gone

leaving spouts of blood poised for an instant in the smoke

EXT FLOWERING MEADOW AS BEFORE

NATURAL SOUND

Serozha picks up Anya like a parcel under his arm and walks
on with her

towards the indistinct figures of Croquet Players strolling
in the heat haze

a couple of parasols held aloft

FADE TO BLACK
