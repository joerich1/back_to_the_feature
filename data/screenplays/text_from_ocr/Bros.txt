BACK TO THE PODCAST

BOBBY
These big movie producers came to
me and said “we want you to write a
rom com about a gay couple But
something for everyone something a
straight guy might even like and
watch with his girlfriend” And I
said “Something a straight guy
might like Like what exactly Am
I gonna be in the middle of some
high speed chase and then all of a
sudden fall in love with Ice Cube
Am I gonna get buttfucked by the
Rock while were both I don’t
know dealing with a volcano” And
they said “We just want a movie
that shows the world straight and
gay relationships are the same
Love is love is love” And I said
“Love is love is love No it’s not
That’s bullshit And I left

FINAL CALLER
Why did you do that

BOBBY
Because I don’t trust them You
can’t trust these people Honestly
it’s for the best I’m not the
right person to write a rom com
anyway

INT - THE LGBTQ PRIDE AWARDS - STAGE

An NFL player is on stage accepting his award It says OUT

LGBTQ Athlete of the Year on the screen behind him

NFL PLAYER
Being in the NFL I never thought I
could come out For years I had to
suffer as a hot ripped gay person
living my life in private But this
last year has really shown me how
amazing life can be when you are
finally publicly hot

The audience applauds

ANNOUNCER (VO)
And now please welcome Emmy and
Tony winner Kristin Chenoweth

BOBBY (CONTD)
Here we see them touching noses
which represents kissing the most
intimate physical contact allowed
in hieroglyphics They were even
buried in the same tomb Yet to
this day there are historians who
refuse to accept these men were
lovers and insist they were
brothers instead

(MORE)
Pink Rev (mmddyy) 5

BOBBY (CONTD)
They say we don’t have enough proof
they were in love and they focus on
their doubts Thus began five
thousand years of gay love stories
erased from history No history of
gay love affairs to teach us about
love and how to love each other No
LGBTQ wing in the Natural History
Museum or the Smithsonian No LGBTQ
wing in the Smithsonian but they
have Archie Bunker’s couch Well
this erasure ends today I’m
thrilled to announce we are opening
the first National LGBTQ History
Museum

very built dude passes him and very quickly scales a large

rock climbing wall Bobby rolls his eyes and mutters

Climbing a mountain What a useful

Henry is fixated on a very ripped hot shirtless guy with a

MUSIC CUE “OUR LOVE IS HERE TO STAY” by NAT KING COLE

EXT STREET 20

Bobby awkwardly tries to throw the sticky napkin into a
garbage can on the street He walks around the city INTERCUT
with doing his podcast

INT PODCASTING STUDIO 21

BOBBY
For me the cold and awkward Grindr
hookup is often followed by a walk
around the city by myself Even
though it was odd and unsatisfying
and you didn’t even know the
person you’re still feeling this
kind of post-sex warmth and
wistfulness only there’s no one
there to share that feeling with
because you leave their apartment
immediately because they’re always
weird and you’re a normal person
And maybe I’1l text or call one of
my friends And between the weird
sex with strangers you don’t like
and conversations with friends you
love that you don’t have sex with
you cobble together a version of a
romantic single life And it’s
fine It’s a lot more than what a
lot of other people have in this
world And you try to remember
that

EXT THE LGBTQ MUSEUM 22

Bobby’s on Instagram Live outside a construction site
Pink Rev (mmddyy)

BOBBY
I’m coming to you today from the
future LGBTQ museum Today the
board is deciding which exhibit
belongs in the final wing We have
people on the board from all across
the LGBTQ community - everyone is
really excited and totally getting
along

23 INT LGBT MUSEUM BOARDROOM - DAY

A tense panicky room No one’s getting along

snapping at each other

BOBBY
Ok people It’s getting late We
still need a donor to fund the
exhibit in the final wing And no
one wants to donate until they know
what the exhibit is As you all
know Pier One Imports was supposed
to make a big donation but they
went bankrupt and have been bought
by the Taliban So now that the
Taliban owns Pier One Imports we
are short 5 million dollars Weve
already pushed our opening twice
and we’re running out of time We
need to figure out which exhibit
belongs in the final wing We need
new ideas and we need them now

Everyone is

CHERRY an angry cranky lesbian academic stands up

She shows

Cherry shows a slide of the blue whale having been replaced
by a huge sculpture of JODIE FOSTER dangling in the air with

CHERRY
We need to be bold You know that
blue whale hanging in the Museum of
Natural History

a slide of the blue whale
CHERRY (CONTD)

What about that but instead of a
blue whale it’s a lesbian

open arms as if she’s welcoming people to the exhibit

ROBERT
I like the idea of a sculpture but
why a lesbian and not a bisexual
(MORE)

ce i i i i i a
ROBERT (CONTD)
Can’t it be some sort of big
dangling bisexual

ANGELA
What about a transgender woman from
an Indigenous nation

CHERRY
Oh goddammit Angela what about the
400 lesbians who fought in the
Civil War

BOBBY
Well they weren’t lesbians
necessarily some were trans men
some were women who dressed as men
so they could fight

ROBERT
Stop This building is a rare
chance to legitimize and validate
the history of bisexuals

BOBBY
Oh here we go

ROBERT
We say LGBTQ but we always skip
over the B People don’t even
believe we exist This is a chance
to change that I want a Hall of
Bisexuals Like Disney’s Hall of
Presidents The most important
bisexuals throughout history I
want a stage full of animatronic
talking bisexuals Talking and
moving and gesturing bisexuals
Bisexual holograms Bisexuals
soaring above you everywhere you
look everywhere you turn

BOBBY
We get it Robert

ROBERT
Please don’t interrupt me
Everyone’s always attacking me

WANDA
Robert I want you to know that I
hear you and I love you

Angela rolls her eyes
TAMARA
Well I actually kind of like that
cause it is so funny I mean we’re
funny creative people The museum
should reflect that

BOBBY
I mean sure to a certain degree but
this isn’t the Museum of the Wacky
Gay Neighbor Let’s not turn
ourselves into a joke I think we
should just expand the AIDS
Memorial and end on that And
again respectfully Tamara you’re
just here to document this for
social media so please leave the
brainstorming to us

TAMARA
Well my mother is Cuban and I will
not be silenced

BOBBY
Your mother is Cuban My mother is
dead I mean talk about someone who
currently has very limited
opportunities

TAMARA
Well I have feelings and thoughts
and ideas and they are valid and
Ill be sharing each and every
single one of them

ANGELA
Well this may be controversial but
I don’t think the AIDS Memorial
needs to be 4 rooms

BOBBY
Excuse me

ANGELA
I’m just saying I don’t want this
place to be all pain and heartache
I see it as more of a victory lap

BOBBY
You don’t want a proper AIDS
Memorial This city should have an
entire AIDS Museum We have a
museum dedicated exclusively to
trains

ROBERT
But does it need to be the final
exhibit The message we leave
people with

ANGELA
It is a little unseemly to have the
AIDS Memorial drop you off in the
gift shop

CHERRY
A lesbian wrote America the
Beautiful Where’s her exhibit
Katharine Lee Bates a lesbian in
1893 - she scrawled the lyrics on a
napkin You can go to her house in
Virginia - they have the napkin

TAMARA
I’ve got it What if the museum
ends with a recreation of a queer
wedding A happy ending

EVERYONE BUT BOBBY
Oh I love thatThat’s so sweet
My parents would love that

BOBBY
And people can get engaged and
register for wedding gifts here

WANDA
Oh that’s gorgeous

BOBBY
No Im joking That’s terrible
It’s too conventional and
sentimental We need people to
rethink history through a queer
prism - show them the history we’ve
been denied for thousands of years -
not comfort them with another gay
wedding It’s a museum it’s not
Schitt’s Creek

EVERYONE
Oh I love Schitt’s CreekI miss
that showMy parents love Schitt’s
Creek

BOBBY
Ok enough

10A

ANGELA
I just want it to be about love So
much of the museum is about
suffering I think a wedding might
make people happy

BOBBY
But a wedding’s not everyone’s idea
of a happy ending It’s old
fashioned heteronormative
bullshit I don’t live in Schitt’s
Creek ok I live in Manhattan The
exhibit shouldn’t be about settling
down it should be about freedom

ROBERT
Well here’s an idea for an exhibit
- what about a huge sculpture of
two eyes rolling at the thought of
my entire existence

Robert storms out

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Marty squeezes Peter and Paul’s shoulders oddly and leaves

BOBBY
Wait didn’t you have an
announcement too Did I miss it

PETER
No We waited for you Ok So I
totally know this is a little weird
and unexpected but ok so the
reason we’ve been hanging around
with Marty so much is that we
arekind of dating him

BOBBY
What do you mean

PETER
I mean we’re dating him Together
Like as a couple We’re seeing
him I guess it’s kind of like a
thrupple situation

BOBBY
Like you’re having threesomes

PAUL
Well we met him at a party and we
got drunk and yeah we hooked up
But then we started to hang out a
lot and we realized it was more
than just sex We just really like
each other’s company

PETER
I know it sounds crazy but it’s
weirdly normal He’s very chill

BOBBY
Well it sounds so chill I mean
just hearing about it I feel so
relaxed Oh my God - you’re Peter
Paul and Marty

PAUL

EDGAR

PAUL
We’ll be fine We trust each other
enough to do this

BOBBY
Wow I don’t think I could ever
trust anyone that much
PAUL
That’s sad

BOBBY
It’s sad That I don’t want to be
in a thrupple I don’t even want to
be in a couple Just be careful
Youre my friends and I love you
and it’s a slippery slope We’re
men Men dating men Love is not
love We are selfish and horny and
stupid I am too Someone called
into my show the other day and
asked me why I’m still single You
wanna know why Because I’ve been
gay my whole life and I don’t trust
these gay motherfuckers

PETER
Well you might want to see a
therapist because that’s fucked up

BOBBY
Wait why do I need to see a
therapist Because I don’t need to
be in a relationship Oh because
you guys think that means I have
some deep rooted issues or
something - but I don’t I’m fine
I am perfectly fine Maybe you’re
the ones with issues Ohhh - ever
think about that

PAUL
Bobby -

BOBBY
Maybe you’re the ones who are
judgmental about me and my life
With your triplets and your
thrupples Well great maybe now
all the thrupples can babysit all
the triplets

PETER
Bobby I didn’t mean -

BOBBY
You think you’re so progressive
Let me tell you something - with
your open marriages and your babies
and your thrupples - I think maybe
the most progressive thing you can
be is alone That’s radical

(MORE)

BOBBY (CONTD)
You want me to support your
marriages fine But then you have
to support me - a happily single
not co-dependent basically
celibate person on Twitter

27 INT DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

The dance floor at the club is filled with shirtless men
Bobby stands in his turtleneck with his best friend HENRY

BOBBY

launching We’ve had Grindr weve
had Tinder and now we have

age on his profile He was nice -
great body And he had this big
grey beard I felt like Mrs Claus

ANGLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR where everyone stares down at their
phones swiping In a sea of heads all looking down Aaron
Shepard looks up at Bobby It’s brief but their eyes connect

HENRY (CONTD)
There’s that guy Aaron

BOBBY

BOBBY
That body My god He’s ripped

HENRY

injected steroids into Dumbledore

Suddenly Aaron appears next to Bobby He is SHIRTLESS and in
jeans with a ripped body and a baseball cap He initiates
conversation but he is quiet and seems shy

AARON
Hey What’s up

BOBBY
Hey What’s up

first thing I would think is who’s
this person gonna leave their shit
to when they die I really wanted
to be part of the legal logistics
of that

Bobby laughs

BOBBY
Actually the head of The LGBTQ
Senior Center called me and was
looking for someone with your
skills to do some pro bono work for
them

AARON
What’s that

BOBBY
It’s the community center for LGBTQ
senior citizens We’ve never had as
Many openly gay seniors as we do
right now And there are some very
specific issues that pop up around
LGBTQ death

AARON
Sounds really fun

Bobby points to someone on the dance floor

BOBBY
Wow that man will just not stop
vogue-ing He’s been vogue-ing since

They both laugh Aaron notices a ripped go-go boy dressed as
a baseball player dancing on top of a small stage

AARON

BOBBY
He is

AARON

I’m supposed to fuck him and his
boyfriend later

BOBBY
Oh Cool That must be hard for
such a shy person My god look at
your abs You’re like a tortoise

AARON

BOBBY
Yeah And that’s your pretty
protective shell that everyone
likes and that you can hide in when
youre feeling scared and shy

AARON
Harsh

BOBBY
Are you on steroids

AARON
Ha No

Bobby looks at Aaron’s body He can’t help but be attracted
to him Similarly even though Bobby is a bit of a dick
Aaron is amused and drawn to his directness

AARON (CONTD)
You having fun

BOBBY
I mean I guess I’m 42 If I was
straight I’d be home right now
getting fat on my couch dealing
with kids or I don’t know doing
whatever straight white people do
I think they sit at home watching
things with Jason Bateman

Aaron laughs Bobby laughs too They clink Shitrockets

AARON
I listen to your podcast

BOBBY
Ohhhh So is that why you’re
talking to me Cause I’m famous

AARON

Aaron winks at him Bobby is offended He looks at the dance
floor And when he turns back around Aaron’s gone

BOBBY
Where did he go (he looks around

Henry returns

HENRY

BOBBY
I don’t know I hate these people

AARON
Gay guys are so stupid

BOBBY
Oh my God I know I know Gay
guys are usually the absolute
smartest or like the dumbest
people I’ve ever met But we’ve
been smart enough to brand
ourselves as being smart and
clever

AARON
Yup I’ve hooked up with guys and
then after I’1l make a joke or say
something sarcastic and the guy
does not understand that I am
making a joke Literally does not
understand satire

BOBBY
I love you I’ve never been in love
with anyone in my life but you’re
the first one

AARON
Can I be honest I think we’re
moving too slowly

Bobby tries to kiss Aaron Aaron turns to avoid it Suddenly
the lights strobe Aaron is gone

vogue dancers who refuse to stop vogue-ing in his face

Yeah I have a hard time
forgetting about the other stuff
You think stained glass windows

Exactly History has erased gay
love stories so we dont grow up
learning how to love each other I
did a whole Ted Talk about it
A37

OMITTED

Pink Rev (mmddyy) 32-33

AARON
I’m sure you did I had an idea for a
show called The Masked Ted Talk It’s
a combination of the Masked Singer
and a Ted Talk so like you’d have a
person giving a speech about female
empowerment but they’re dressed like
a giant caterpillar

BOBBY
Youre like secretly very funny

on him He panics He’s flailing and trying to swat it

AARON
Stop swatting - you’ll kill it

BOBBY

AARON

removes the bee from the back of his neck and sets it free
AARON
See No reason to kill it

supposed to laugh it off That
whole era of weird bro comedies was
so fucked up

Oh The Treasure Inside It’s
supposed to be really good (TBD
Prestigious Actor) and Nick play
closeted frontiersmen in Jonas the
California Gold Rush of 1849 of
course it has to be two straight
guys Straight guys are always
allowed to play gay and gay men are
hardly ever allowed to play
straight They’re worried the
audience won’t believe it And I’m
like - look at the shit people
believe Star Wars Transformers
Spider Man - people won’t believe a
gay man can play straight but they
believe in fucking Chewbacca

showed up and refused to leave
Everyone there are rock paintings

homosexuality If only the men on
those paintings could’ve lived
10000 years to see a character
come out on It’s Always Sunny in
Philadelphia Please give
generously so the Museum can tell
all the stories in between that
have never been told Goodnight

This is the Legends Pavilion
Unsung heroes from LGBTQ history
This is We’wha a revered
transgender Native American “two-
spirit” from the Zuni tribe in the
1800’s She was accused of
witchcraft and sent to prison

(moving on)
Magnus Hirschfeld was a doctor who
founded the Sex Institute of Berlin
in the 1930s which carried out the
first advocacy for LGBTQ rights It
was burned to the ground and
destroyed by the Nazis

(moving on)
This is Bayard Rustin a close
adviser to Dr Martin Luther King
and chief organizer of the March on
Washington Rustin was openly gay
even in the face of some homophobes
in the Civil Rights Movement who
at one point set up a committee to
determine whether it was worth
keeping him around What do you
think Incredible right

AARON
It’s like all AIDS and Nazis and
homophobia It’s a bit of a downer

BOBBY
Well it’s a painful history People
need to experience it

AARON
I’m just giving you my reaction

to be “A Night at the Gay Museum”
Pink Rev (mmddyy) 47

Harvey Milk Amy Schumer as Eleanor
Roosevelt

AARON

BOBBY
Oh my God Ok I’m coming Aaron

Bobby leaves Aaron sees himself reflected in the glass of an
empty display seeing himself in the context of history and
all these icons In his mind’s eye the display’s blank plaque

The board waits impatiently as he texts Aaron again We see his
phone as he scrolls through multiple unanswered texts

WANDA
Bobby Whenever you’re ready

BOBBY
Oh Ok great Um -

Bobby sits up and pulls it together to begin his pitch

BOBBY (CONTD)
People wonder if America is ready
for its first gay President - I say
we already had one For the final
wing please consider The Lincoln
Letters A Gay American Love Story
For years historians have
speculated about Lincolns
sexuality He shared a bed and
exchanged romantic letters with two
different men Joshua Speed and
David Derrickson Speed for many
years-

ROBERT
I’m stopping you It won’t work
Bobby You can’t say Lincoln was
gay

WANDA
Well I think it’s interesting And
why not be a little controversial

ROBERT
Because there’s not enough
evidence
48A

BOBBY
Well there you have it - no
evidence of love Of course we
don’t have enough evidence Robert -
we weren’t allowed to exist

ROBERT
Lincoln was married to a woman and
had three children He wasn’t gay
Bobby - at most he was bi

ANGELA
Well if you ask me Lincoln is just
another cis white man

CHERRY
Just another cis white man He’s
Abraham Lincoln

ANGELA
Not according to wokecunt

BOBBY
Who the hell is wokecunt

ROBERT
A hugely popular TikTok historian

WANDA
Gigantic influencer

TAMARA
wokecunt is my hero

BOBBY
Well with all due respect to Woke
Cunt she’s not on the board of
this Museum

ANGELA

But it’s not even accurate We all
know James Buchanan came before
Lincoln and he was the first gay
President He was hooking up with
Senator and future Vice President
William Rufus King You just don’t
want to mention that Bobby because
Buchanan was a Conservative prick

ROBERT
And Hitler was gay too

BOBBY
Ok we’re not talking about that

WANDA
People Enough Let’s vote on it

Everyone writes down which exhibit they want and slips it to
Wanda Bobby looks at his phone Still no text from Aaron

WANDA (CONTD)
Ok We have two votes for Great
Bisexuals of the World

Instead I get a bunch of tedious
complaints I’ve heard eight
thousand times before Did I waltz
in here and lay all my shit on you
I’m a divorced single mother -- you
want to hear what that’s like

BOBBY
No I mean I’m so sorry --

Wanda Cherry and Angela rush in

CHERRY
What’s going on here

DEBRA MESSING
Do you have some personal shit you
want to complain about to me

CHERRY
No --

DEBRA MESSING
Of course not Because lesbians
have their shit together I gotta
go I lose my sitter in an hour

Debra Messing exits

WANDA
Bobby what is going on with you
We’re down to the wire If Debra
doesn’t donate we’re almost out of
options Figure this out Bobby

INT NEW WORKOUT CLASS - “XXXTREME BALLPIT” 49

Bobby Henry Tina Tom and Lucas wade through a colorful
ball pit lifting weights above their heads in the new class
XXXTREME BALLPIT

TINA
What do you mean he just left

BOBBY

I mean one minute he was in the
museum and the next he was gone
Like Casper that Fucked Up Ghost
This asshole has somehow gotten
into my head and he has me acting
like a crazy person And now we
don’t know if Debra Messing will
donate And if she doesn’t we’re
fucked This is not who I am I
don’t know what’s happening to me

HENRY
Aaron doesn’t have his shit
together You deserve better

Suddenly Tom and Lucas start squealing in delight

TOM
Wait Our surrogate texted us this
new sonogram Look at our babies

Tina and Henry race towards Tom and Lucas in the ballpit

LUCAS
Bobby look

TOM
Look - one almost has toes

BOBBY
Quite an accomplishment Sorry I
was actually going through
something

TOM
Oh stop moping about your one night
stand What did you expect

BOBBY
What did I expect Well I didn’t
expect him to just ditch me like
that What I did expect was that
you two would adopt

LUCAS
Excuse me

BOBBY
No it’s wonderful I’m just saying
at one point you said you would
only adopt

LUCAS
Tom decided he wanted his own kids

BOBBY
Well ok but you said your
grandfather was a racist and an
anti-semite so what’s so great
about your DNA that you so
desperately had to spread it
around

Bobby laughs at his own joke but the others don’t

LUCAS
Gee Bobby it’s just so hard to
figure out why you would’ve scared
Aaron away

TINA
Ok settle down various gays Look
maybe Aaron’s not the one but you
liked going out with him right
Maybe it’s a sign you should go on
some dates

BOBBY
I don’t know I’m not a going-on-
dates person you know that I’m
better off alone - all these guys
are full of shit You can’t trust
them And here’s the worst part -
no one ever looks like their
pictures You meet them on some app
and then you meet them in person
and they’re always exactly 30
uglier than how they looked in
their photos It’s not fair

50 INT BOBBY’S APT - LATER THAT DAY 50

Bobby scrolls through Tinder We see a brief MONTAGE of Bobby
matching with guys and then meeting them in person

When he meets them WE SEE THEIR FACES MORPH from their
perfect Tinder selfie into the real face sitting across from
Bobby on a date which is always 30 less attractive
Finally he matches with SAM a cute guy and the face is
accurate

EXT CAFE - DAY 51

Bobby and Sam drink beers They’re laughing and having fun

SAM
So have you ever had sex with a
woman

BOBBY

As a matter of fact I have
(joking) Do you know someone by the
name of Kate Winslet

SAM
I don’t

BOBBY
Oh Ok I didn’t have sex with her
She’s an actress Really you don’t
know her Titanic

SAM
Never saw it
(MORE)
Pink Rev (mmddyy)

SAM (CONTD)
Not a big movie guy
But I read a lot

BOBBY
Oh cool I read a lot too I
actually just finished that new
Walt Whitman biography Have you
read it Ok this is crazy Did you
know Walt Whitman America’s
greatest poet of the 19th century
published a magazine about men’s
physique under a pseudonym It was
called “MANLY HEALTH” - it was a 13
part series basically teaching men
how to build muscle and look hot
Walt Whitman did this

SAM
No way

BOBBY
Yeah “America’s poet” Meanwhile
if he were alive today he wouldn’t
have time to write “Leaves of
Grass” he’d probably just be Chris
Pratt’s trainer Personal trainers
are the new poets

SAM
I feel like he’d probably be some
kinky jock-sniffing leather queen
with his cock in a cage

BOBBY
Exactly

SAM
Have you ever worn one of those

BOBBY
A cock cage

SAM
Yeah one of those little metal
cages that trap your penis so you
can’t get hard until your master
unlocks it

BOBBY
No but I’ve seen them -—

So my boyfriend put me in one real

give me the key And then my
grandpa died

BOBBY
Oh my god

SAM
Yeah And I had to go back to
Michigan for the funeral But there
was no way I was getting through
airport security with that thing
on So I rent a car drive nine
hours to Ann Arbor nonstop then I
have to sit through my grandpa’s
funeral in a cock cage

BOBBY
That is very strange

SAM
Yeah But it was also kinda hot
Like my dick still belonged to
Ethan

BOBBY (CONTD)
Ow (beat) Ow Ow

SAM
You like that Have you ever tried

Sam leans over to his night table and pulls out what look
like 2 small soft black rubber knobs from the drawer

SAM (CONTD)
They’re called nipple plumpers

BOBBY
They’re called what

SAM
They suction on to your nipples
They make ‘em really swollen and

sensitive

BOBBY
Oh OK (as Sam puts them on) Ow
Ow

Sam puts the nipple plumpers on Bobby’s nipples Sam is now
alternating between Bobby’s nipples pinching them one by
one slowly pinching harder and harder with Bobby saying
“ow ow” every time but enjoying it This escalates Sam’s
now really going after Bobby’s nipples sometimes one by one
sometimes both at the same time handling them as if Bobby’s
nipples are the console in some intense video game This
builds to where Sam has both his fists yanking both nipples
at the same time shaking Bobby’s entire body that way Bobby
is flailing and convulsing in ecstasy as Sam shakes him
intensely rocking him back and forth

BOBBY (CONTD)
Oy oy oy oy oy oy oyyyyy
Sam goes for one more really intense pinch with both hands
BOBBY (CONTD)
Ahhh Ok ok that’s enough I need
a break Let’s take them off

SAM
Oh ok sure God that was hot

Sam tries to take them off But they’re not coming off

SAM (CONTD)
They’re really suctioned on there

He pulls them again

BOBBY
Ow Ow

Sam goes for it and pulls harder Bobby screams “OW OW”
but they’re still stuck

BOBBY (CONTD)
What the fuck

SAM
I’m sorry - they’re stuck

BOBBY
YA THINK Just let me do it

Bobby grabs at them himself pulling hard to the point where
he rocks himself into a fetal position trying to get them off
- but they won’t come off

BOBBY (CONTD)
Fuck What am I gonna do Why did
you put these on me

SAM
I’m sorry This doesn’t usually
happen - hold on let me pour some
lube on there and they’1l slip off

Sam gets his lube bottle and pours it on Bobby’s chest then
sets the bottle aside It falls off the bed and drips on to
the floor Bobby starts to gently massage the lube into the
suction cups on his very sore chest which turns Sam on

SAM (CONTD)
God you look hot right now

BOBBY
Are you jerking off

SAM
I’m sorry You’re so hot

BOBBY
Stop it Oh my god what am I gonna
do They won’t come off They won’t
come off I’m panicking

Bobby shoves Sam aside He jumps up from the bed As his feet
hit the floor Bobby slips on the lube and falls down

BOBBY (CONTD)
OW I SLIPPED ON THE LUBE

SAM
Oh my god are you ok

Sam jumps off the bed to help him and Sam slips on the lube
too Bobby gets himself up slipping and sliding on the lube
as he yanks his clothes on

SAM (CONTD)
I’m so sorry I really am I hada
really good time tonight

BOBBY
I DIDN’T THIS IS WHY I DON’T DO
THIS

crazy on each other they get lube out and start using it
they consensually choke each other they spit on each other
Aaron sticks his whole hand in Bobby’s mouth Bobby licks
Aaron’s biceps maybe Aaron gives Bobby a rim job if there’s
a way to film that etc etc Eventually this turns into sex

thrusts creating fart noises

Never thought I’d date someone who
knows Austin Powers but not Debra
Messing Where did I go wrong

AARON
Date someone Um are we dating

BOBBY
Um no We’re not dating I like to
think of it less as dating and more
as punching each other followed by
you listing off all my physical
deformities We’re not dating We
don’t date people remember

AARON
Oh I remember

Bobby cuddles next to Aaron They both look slightly
terrified Bobby closes his eyes and allows himself to put
his weight on Aaron Aaron starts petting his hair gently We
watch the guys let go and relax into each other

different chocolate brands in the
encyclopedia and see how they were
made

in Tuscany and all these fancy
European chocolates I used to tell

really serious about it But what
was I gonna do with that What was
I gonna be

BOBBY
A chocolatier

AARON
I’ve never told anyone that

BOBBY

career or whatever I was just
supposed to get a good job that

go to law school so I did Got a
good job made good money I did

INT LAWRENCE GRAPE’S HOUSE - DAY

Bobby sits across from Lawrence Aaron sits next to Bobby

is

BOBBY
Mr Grape we’re thinking the final
wing will be about Lincoln

Lawrence is distracted as he excitedly dresses his two
puppies in ridiculous pride outifts for the parade One is an
adorable small dog the other is a very large greyhound

LAWRENCE GRAPE
Love it love Lincoln

BOBBY
Few people realize our greatest
president was also --

Lawrence continues to futz with the costumes and the puppies

BOBBY (CONTD)
President First gay president Wow
look at those outfits

LAWRENCE GRAPE
I had these made And several
fittings later here we are (to
the dog) Who’s a proud puppy Who’s
the proudest puppy So this is a
Lincoln museum

Lawrence struggles to put some sort of pride hat and little
pride shoes on the dogs

BOBBY
No It’s an LGBTQ museum the
world’s first we spoke last year -

LAWRENCE GRAPE
That damn bush

Lawrence looks past Bobby and Aaron out the window Bobby and
Aaron look behind them at a bush that’s growing outside

LAWRENCE GRAPE (CONTD)
My neighbor planted that fucking
bush and it blocks my view Can you
believe that

Lawrence abruptly leaves In the BG we see him walk outside
start to yank on the bush and argue with his neighbor

BOBBY
This is a nightmare He only cares
about putting pride outfits on his
dogs

AARON
Ok from my experience at my job
weird rich people like to be
listened to Maybe ask him what
he’s interested in

BOBBY
But I don’t care what he’s
interested in Fuck Listening Ok
I‘ll try it

Lawrence returns

LAWRENCE GRAPE
Boys I have to get going -

Beat Aaron nods at Bobby

BOBBY
Lawrence tell me - what do you
think should go in the museum It
could be anything anything at all

Lawrence thinks Bobby is about to speak Aaron stops him

LAWRENCE GRAPE
The final wing of the museum should
be a haunted house of gay trauma

BOBBY
What

LAWRENCE GRAPE
You get in a cart on a track and
you hear some muted 1950s music
like Richie Valens or something --

BOBBY
So this is a ride

Aaron puts his hand on Bobby’s arm

LAWRENCE GRAPE
Yeah it’s a fucking ride Unless
you think a ride is too much --

BOBBY
No not at all Tell me more

LAWRENCE GRAPE
We find ourselves in an intimate
little bar with some young
animatronic men

(MORE)

LAWRENCE GRAPE (CONTD)
And the men turn to dance with each
other when suddenly BOOM A cop car
smashes through the wall and police
show up and there’s sirens and
batons and voices screaming and the
cart takes off roller coaster style
and then there’s blood everywhere
and a monster with Reagan’s face
chases the cart backwards down the
hallway Pirates of the Caribbean
style and then boom we shoot out
into the light andit ends happy
on like a rainbow or something
Point is we gotta shove people’s
faces in our trauma Force them to
confront it this is what it was
like being a gay man in the 20th
century

Bobby doesn’t know what to say

BOBBY
A gay trauma-coaster Very
provocative But I’m not sure we
can afford that

LAWRENCE GRAPE
Ok Well it was lovely meeting you-

AARON
Mr Grape - I’m not a creative guy
but I am a money guy And I can
tell you to accomplish what you
want we’d need more than a little
donation We need five million
dollars And you won’t just get
your gay trauma-coaster You get
the Lincoln exhibit you get all of
it You rewrite history for the
entire LGBTQ community You’re a
storyteller Lawrence And this is
the ultimate story

LAWRENCE GRAPE
But you already pushed the opening
twice Is this really happening

BOBBY
It’s happening I promise

LAWRENCE GRAPE
Five million seems like a low
number to rewrite history I’m in

BOBBY
Oh my god really Thank you

LAWRENCE GRAPE
Congrats on my money Happy Pride

EXT LAWRENCE GRAPES HOUSE

EXT COMMERCIAL STREET IN PROVINCETOWN - THE PRIDE PARADE

Were in the middle of the Pride Parade All 6 Museum board
members are on a float to promote the LGBTQ Museum They are
dressed in skin tight spandex modern dance costumes - full
body stockings which cover their heads so only their faces
stick out They begin doing an absurd modern dance on the
float as a tribute to black LGBTQ icon Alvin Ailey which
they clearly choreographed themselves

The small float just ahead of theirs is filled with fabulous
drag queens in colorful outfits blasting club music and
dancing The float just behind theirs is the Gay Bear float
filled with shirtless plus-sized gay bears guzzling beers
eating dancing and getting rowdy as they blast Classic Rock

While doing a particularly feminine looking dance step Bobby
looks down at the crowd and locks eyes with Aaron who’s now
tipsy and watching the parade with his friends Bobby is
mortified wearing this deeply unsexy costume

Next to Aaron are 3 young drunk Gen Z queer friends all in
costume dressed as the Wicked Witch of the West complete
with green faces etc all holding phones They notice Bobby
on the float Aaron overhears them as they snicker

WITCH 1
Ugh why does Bobby Leiber get to
run the gay museum I can’t stand
him

WITCH 2
I know He’s so loud and obnoxious
He is way too much And he’s not
even cute

WITCH 3
He has no style If you’re gonna be
that irritating at least wear cool
shoes or a fun sock

WITCH 1
Oh my god you have to tweet that

WITCH 3
No one likes him except for
straight people and old queens

WITCH 2
Plus he looks like when Shrek turns
back into a human

Witch 2 shows them a pic of human Shrek on his phone It
does look like Bobby They all snicker and cackle As the
witches cackle and laugh a drunk Aaron butts in

AARON
Hey who the fuck are you guys

WITCH 1
Excuse me We’re the Gay Twitter
Witches Everyone knows us and
everyone wants to be us We have
126000 followers

WITCH 2
And we’re not afraid to tell it
like it is while selling makeup

AARON
Do you even know Bobby He’s
actually a good person and he works
his ass off

WITCH 1
Well he must’ve worked his ass off
cause it’s totally flat And who
the fuck are you you fucking
roided out pretty boy

WITCH 3
Oh my god an old white muscle queen
who thinks he’s still relevant Is
it 1998 Am I watching Third Rock
from the Sun

WITCH 2
Youre old

A drunk Witch 2 shoves Aaron

AARON
Hey Don’t do that

EXT GUEST HOUSE PRIVATE BEACH - SUNSET

Aaron comes out of the water He looks insanely hot Bobby
sits on the beach admiring Aaron as Aaron walks over to him

BOBBY
I still can’t believe what you did
with Lawrence That was amazing

Aaron shrugs

BOBBY (CONTD)
It’s not too late you know You
could quit your job You could do
anything Open a chocolate shop

AARON
I’m not quitting my job to open a
chocolate shop I don’t have your
confidence

BOBBY
I’m not that confident

AARON
Youre literally the most confident
person I’ve ever met Like to a
fault It’s actually scary

BOBBY
Trust me - it’s all an act You
think I sing well now I was even
better when I was a kid Had
American Idol existed then I
would’ve been the gay guy with an
amazing voice who comes in second

Aaron laughs
BOBBY (CONTD)

So then I started taking acting
classes and in college my musical
theater teacher told me I had a
gay walk and a flamboyant
quality which would “limit my
options” Then for grad school I
went to one of the best journalism
schools in the country and a
professor - this closeted queen who
was married to a woman - pulled me
aside and thought he was doing me a
favor when he told me that I should
stick to writing because my voice
was too gay to do the news on TV
My gay history books Every single
publisher I met with told me there
wasnt enough of an audience for
it I was always too gay or too
niche or I made people
uncomfortable And if you hear all
of that for years no matter who
you are you start to worry that
maybe its true But what else was
I going to do Thats who I am So
I just put my head down and I did
the work and I just hoped that
somehow against all odds all
those other people were somehow
wrong

(beat)
And they were Which is why you
can’t trust anybody

Aaron stands close to Bobby He then starts spastically but
passionately flailing his arms and legs to the music like
doing little jabs with them He is rhythmless but his passion
is adorable Bobby starts to crack up Aaron’s movements get
bigger and wilder as he spastically dances around Bobby

AARON
Where’s dinner again

INT THEME RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A very flamboyant singing waiter is finishing up belting out
“IM FLYING” from Peter Pan either on a small stage or in
between the tables at a restaurant where the servers
sometimes break out into song

SINGING WAITER
(singing to a track)
“Im flyinglook at me way up
high suddenly here I am I’m
flyyyyinggggg”

The diners including Aaron’s family applauds

AARON
How’re the Polar Bears doing dad
(to Bobby)
That’s the team Josh and I were on

Bobby smiles and nods He doesn’t seem like himself He’s
clearly trying hard to seem quiet and not say much

BRUCE
Haven’t won all year I told Josh
they need you boys to come back

They all laugh Bobby puts on the weird “polite” smile again
and nods without making sound

ANNE
Bobby you seem quiet tonight Is
everything alright

BOBBY
Me Oh yes I’m fine I’m sorry I
hope I didn’t talk too much today
This is actually how I usually am
I’m very quiet

(MORE )

BOBBY (CONTD)
Very quiet and just very very
normal Most people think I’m
straight

Aaron sighs His parents are confused but laugh

ANNE
Well thank you again for planning
such a lovely day It was perfect

BOBBY
Youre so welcome Mrs Shepard

ANNE
But you have to stop calling me
Mrs Shepard You sound like one of
my students Call me Anne

BOBBY
Ok I will

AARON
Moms been teaching 2nd grade for
almost 40 years now

BOBBY
That’s so great Good teachers are
so important now more than ever

ANNE
Thank you I agree And Aaron says
youre working in an American
History Museum

BOBBY
Wellyes Yes it is It’s an
American History Museum

Bobby takes a sip of his drink

BOBBY (CONTD)
Well specifically it’s an LGBTQ
History Museum It’s actually the
first major queer history museum in
America Do you teach your students
any gay history I know in a few
states they’re finally teaching it

ANNE
Well I teach 2nd grade so no

BOBBY
Ah Right I see

politely

Bobby takes a sip of his drink

BOBBY (CONTD)
Out of curiosity why not

ANNE
Well second grade - I think
they’re a little young for that
Don’t get me wrong - I’m sure that
history is fascinating I just
think that’s a little young

BOBBY
Right right I understand
(beat)
I don’t think so though

AARON
Bobby

BOBBY
If I may disagree Respectfully
Honestly that’s the best time to
teach them - when they’re young
That way they have an appreciation
for LGBT people before they start
bullying each other or hating
themselves if they’re gay

ANNE
Well maybe you’re right

Anne takes a sip of her drink

ANNE (CONTD)
Feels a little young though

BOBBY
Oh totally I get it

Bobby takes a sip of his drink

BOBBY (CONTD)
It’s not though You should think
about it Illinois passed a law
that mandates LGBT history be
taught in elementary schools So
did New Jersey

ANNE
Oh I know dear It just - it just
feels a little young
BOBBY
I understand I’1l drop it Agree
to disagree

ANNE
Cheers to that

They all laugh and clink glasses

BOBBY
It’s not really that young though
It’s not that young

AARON
Can you please drop this

BOBBY
Well no I can’t We’re talking
about gay kids here it’s
important Look at the things we
teach kids all the time We keep
gay people a secret to 5 year olds
but they literally know everything
about mermaids

AARON
Oh my God

BOBBY
I’m telling you - one of the things
that saved me is that my parents
exposed me to gay stories when I
was young When I was 12 years old
we saw a Broadway play called “Love
and Compassion” about gay men
spending a summer on Fire Island
And all of a sudden the curtain
goes up and there are 7 completely
naked gay men on stage There I am
at age 12 - sitting in between my
mom and dad - looking at 7 soft
penises And it was wonderful
And then two men start kissing And
then they start talking dirty At
one point one of them yelled out
“Pound my prostate Pound my
prostate” - Anne I swear I didn’t
even know what that was But it was
amazing It had a profound effect
on me To know that I could sit
there with my parents and see seven
soft penises - seven penises Anne -
I was 12 - and to know my parents
were ok with that

(MORE )

BOBBY (CONTD)
My point is we need to remove the
stigma from all of this so gay kids
can feel good about themselves I
mean look at Aaron and how much he
hates his life-

AARON
Bobby -

BOBBY
I’m just saying there is a direct
correlation between how unhappy you
are and what you didn’t learn about
your potential as a child -

AARON
Bobby What is wrong with you He’s
just performing This is what he
does

BOBBY
Performing This is the truth about
gay kids some of whom are in your
class Anne We’re all accountable

AARON
Enough Seriously I will kill you
ANNE (VO)
(with real worry and
concern)

Aaron - you hate your life

EXT THEME RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Bobby and Aaron wave goodbye as the parents drive off

BOBBY

Aaron remains silent He hails a cab

BOBBY (CONTD)
Hey Are you mad

Suddenly waiters start to sing the “RAMA LAMA LAMA” bridge
from “We Go Together” from Grease while they dance joyously
around the table circling the family

AARON
(clearly mad)
Me Nah I’m great Josh is texting
me I’m gonna go to this bar

BOBBY
I think we should talk about this

AARON
Oh you wanna talk more

BOBBY
I think it’s more important than
going to party with Josh the Self
Loathing Giant who took 35 years to
come out

AARON
Not everyone’s you Bobby

BOBBY
Ok but 35 years My god JRR
Tolkien took less time with his
journey

BOBBY
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

Josh stumbles away

BOBBY (CONTD)
What the hell are you doing

AARON
Bobby calm down

BOBBY
My God I was so fucking stupid I
knew it from the beginning and I
tried to tell myself it wasn’t
true Cause I see the guys you look
at Aaron All these wannabe
straight fucking bros at the club
in the park Everywhere we go
Josh Fucking Josh

AARON
That’s not true-

BOBBY

Then just go be with them Aaron If
that’s what you want But I will
not let you drag me into this any
further and I will not let you
break my heart I am too smart for
that

AARON

Bobby God Let me speak You think
youre so perfect You think you
never do anything wrong Why did
you say that shit about me in front
of my parents I begged you not to
embarrass me But you couldn’t help
yourself What is wrong with you

BOBBY
Oh don’t turn this around on me
This is all on you “Tone it down
Bobby” “Take it down a notch
Bobby” “Can’t you just be a little
bit less of yourself” Fuck you
How dare you You don’t think I
know what that means You don’t
think I know what that’s code for
You don’t think I’ve heard that my
whole fucking life I didn’t come
this far just to have a self-
loathing sad aging frat boy tell me
I’m embarrassing All of a sudden I
embarrass you I will not apologize
for who I am I will leave that to
you

AARON
Oh my God Bobby I am so sick of
this whole self-righteous act Stop
being so fucking dramatic I wasn’t
asking you to “change who you are”
I was just asking you to be
sensitive about my insecurities in
front of my parents And yes I know
that’s pathetic for a 38 year old
man but I’m a fucking human ok And
I just wanted you to be a little
understanding But no - you had to
turn it into The Bobby Show and
make it about you like you always
do Who does that I got drunk and
kissed an old friend behind a bar
I’m not saying it was right And
I’m sorry But don’t act so
virtuous because you’re just a
selfish mess like the rest of us

BOBBY
But what exactly were you so
embarrassed by today Huh That’s
what I want to know That I talked
about what I do That I sound the
way I sound

(MORE )

BOBBY (CONTD)

That I couldn’t keep up with you
and Josh during your little hockey
game Or that no matter how much
you like me I am still not as hot
to you as a real man Isn’t that
right Aaron Just fucking say it
because I already know

Aaron doesn’t respond Bobby is devastated

BOBBY (CONTD)
I can’t believe I trusted you
Simple men With bad taste Never
trust them

AARON
You can trust me -

BOBBY
It’s fine I’m fine But you are
who you are Aaron You like what
you like And I know how this ends
And it does not end well for me
And we don’t have to put each other
through this Isn’t that the great
thing about being guys like you and
me Because I have never needed
this Until now And I am mad at
you for making me want it

Bobby starts to walk off

BOBBY (CONTD)
Look maybe we’re just not
relationship people I guess we
knew that It’s ok We tried

Bobby starts to walk away fighting back tears As he does a
man approaches with a clipboard

open marriages No boring
heteronormative gay people All the
possibilities It’s so exciting
Pink Rev (mmddyy) 106

BOBBY
What So now I’m too gay for Aaron
but I’m too straight for you What
do you want Should I just be some
big flaming queen you can laugh at
and not take seriously Or maybe I
should just pretend I’m straight so

PLEASE TELL ME EXACTLY HOW GAY I’M
SUPPOSED TO BE I mean you won’t
even let poor Abraham Lincoln be
gay now

WANDA

Because he wasnt gay Bobby
ROBERT

BOBBY

Ok ENOUGH You need Lincoln to be
straight You need Lincoln to be
bi Why cant he just be gay You
wanna know why Because you dont
want to be gay Robert Youre
trying to hold on to some bullshit
shred of masculinity

ROBERT
(hurt)
Are you serious

WANDA
Once again our love stories are
being erased from the record Which
is one of the reasons were so
fucked up when it comes to love If
you cant see it you cant be it
You know who said that

CHERRY
Buddha

BOBBY
No Gayle King You wanna get rid
of our stories fine Lets get rid

WANDA
You can’t fire us It’s a
nonprofit

ANGELA
You know what I don’t need this

CHERRY

ANGELA
You think kids are gonna wanna come
here No one likes museums They’re
boring as shit Why would I go to a
fucking museum when I can sit in my
living room put on my VR goggles
and instantly be living in Tokyo
So as long as we’re all airing our
grievances can I be honest I hate
the museum and I really fucking
hate storytelling

storytelling And maybe whispers amongst the crowd of “She
said she hates storytelling and “She doesn’t like telling

stories”

ANGELA (CONTD)
We have too many goddamn stories
All we do is tell stories Read
stories watch stories Watch
documentaries about the making of a
story History turns into a story
which turns into some exhausting
thinkpiece about the story which
gets read more than the actual
story itself I’m sick of it I’m
sick of it all I’m sick of reading
things and I’m sick watching
things Maybe the final wing should
be a big empty room where people
can go to just shut the fuck up I
don’t want to tell stories

Bobby runs to meet his friends at a late night Crossfit class
lit by candlelight He is a broken man

HENRY
Oh my God - are you okay

BOBBY
No Henry No I’m not I lost it
all The board quit which means
were not going to make our opening
which means donors are going to
pull their funding which means the
entire museum is going to fall
apart All because I tried to be a
bro and I have roid rage

HENRY
Roid rage You only did steroids
twice
BOBBY
Henry you dont understand
(Bobby starts crying)
I have roid rage

HENRY
Bobby people with roid rage arent
openly weeping Sweetheart Aaron
broke your heart so you’re falling
apart

BOBBY
That’s not it My heart is fine
Im fine I’m like you I don’t
need a relationship and I tried to
have one and it didn’t work because
I’m not a relationship person and
I’m better on my own

HENRY
No Bobby you’re not like me at all
because I’m happy right now and
youre miserable

BOBBY
I wasn’t until I met Aaron

PETER
You were unhappy then too That’s
why you judge people so harshly
Like you judged us You try to act
like you don’t need anyone but
clearly you do It’s ok You’re
human Technically

PAUL
Of course the board walked out
Because you don’t trust anyone
else’s point of view You don’t
think about where they’re coming
from Maybe they just got scared
Maybe just maybe not everything
is a personal attack on you

BOBBY
Oh my God Maybe you’re right
Maybeyou’re right andI’m
wrong Is that even possible

MARTY
Of course they’re right That’s why
I love them

HENRY
If I were you I’d go back to the
board apologize profusely and
really listen to what they have to
say Before something else you love
passes you by

BOBBY
I love you boys Thank you

They hug Then all of their phones ding They look down

INT MUSEUM BOARDROOM - THE NEXT DAY 99

BOBBY
I brought cookies from Levain And
brownies that are vegan And
crudités for the diabetics among
us

CHERRY ROBERT
Get to it The clock is ticking

WANDA
Now in the interest of empathy I
said we’d hear him out But I do
have a hard out in twenty Bobby

BOBBY
Look I know I’ve been a very
angry judgmental person Now
anger can be good sometimes For
years it was the fuel I needed to
keep going -

CHERRY
I’m bored

BOBBY
When I was starting out I’d get
upset when I saw another gay man
succeed not because I didn’t think
they were worthy but because I
thought it meant there wouldn’t be
room for me It wasn’t that long
ago the straight world didn’t allow
for that many of us to really
succeed in a big way -

TAMARA
Oh my god remember straight
people

ANGELA

Yeah That was a cute moment

BOBBY
So I decided Id be the most
determined the strongest the
loudest the least penetrable and I
would just steamroll over everyone
and over time that turned me into
this self-centered angry control
freak But the truth is this is
the only community that I love
being a part of You’re my people -
and we fight like crazy and we
always have - but you’re my people
and I’m very sorry I was so rude
and that I talked down to you I
should’ve shown you more respect
There is no group of people I love
and respect more That’s the truth
And I’m just very embarrassed and
I’m so so sorry

ROBERT
Man that shit you said about me -

BOBBY
Especially to you Robert Here’s
the thing - when I was growing up
sometimes guys said they were bi to
avoid admitting they were gay It
was a way of hiding a way of
holding on to their masculinity in
order to save face or something

(MORE )

BOBBY (CONTD)
I don’t want young gay boys to
think they can’t just be gay if
that’s what they really are I just
want them to know that’s ok That’s
all I’ve ever wanted

ROBERT
I understand that and of course I
want that too But times have
changed man Things don’t have to
be black and white Life is short
Bobby I’m not going to deprive
myself of love just to fit into
your limited understanding of the
world And that’s not me hiding
I’m not ashamed this is just who I
am And it hurts when someone tries
to tell me who the fuck I am
Especially someone who is supposed
to be on my side

BOBBY
Youre right And I’m so sorry And
you shouldn’t have had to explain
all of that But I appreciate it
I’m sorry I’m sorry to all of you

Wanda stands up Gives Bobby a good hard look

WANDA
Bobby I want you to know that I
hear you And I forgive you

BOBBY
You do

Wanda looks at Cherry

CHERRY
Yeah me too You can be a self
centered prick but I guess we
should give you a chance to redeem
yourself

TAMARA
I was never that upset with you to
begin with It’s been fun watching
you melt down actually
Pink Rev (mmddyy) 112

Everyone looks at Robert for his response

ROBERT
Well I give you credit for owning
up to your hypocritical bullshit
Most people are too proud to do
that I’m not gonna lie I’m still
angry But if we just keep fighting
that’s all we’re ever doing And I
insist on progress Not just for
our LGBTQ heroes but for our LGBTQ
assholes too Like you So I
forgive you Bobby

BOBBY
Thank you so much Robert I know I
don’t deserve this Thank you

CHERRY
How about you Angela You still
hate museums Are you still gonna
quit this place to go out and live
your life

ANGELA
Well I realized that in order to
live my life I need health
insurance So yeah I’1l come back

WANDA
Well then we should probably
discuss the final exhibit And may
I remind you we open in two weeks

BOBBY
I had a thought actually

ROBERT
Oh here we go

CHERRY
That didn’t take long

BOBBY
No It’s not my idea It’s actually
inspired by what you all said It’s
about love and hope and freedom and
history but mostly it’s about
(Bobby looks at Tamara) all the
possibilities

Tamara takes out her airpods Reveal she’s been listening to
music

Pink Rev (mmddyy) 112A
TAMARA

Sorry what
BOBBY

Consider this just the beginning of

the conversation

Bobby rolls out presentation materials They smile at them

ANGELA
I have some ideas too

BOBBY
Yes please Bring it on Let’s
bring all the ideas on

INT GAY CLUB - NIGHT

Aaron and Josh hang at a club Aaron shouts over the music

AARON
Did you read that Atlantic article
about the gender binary being a
relatively new construct

JOSH EVANS
Nah Dude there are so many guys
here I can’t focus Wanna dance

AARON
No I’m good Not much of a dancer
But you go have fun

Josh dances off Aaron is alone He looks around and realizes

it’s not the same without Bobby He opens Instagram and sees

that Bobby’s at the same club
Aaron confronts Bobby
AARON (CONTD)
Hey Can we talk

EXT GAY CLUB - NIGHT

Bobby sits down on a bike in a row of stationary Citibikes

Aaron sits down on one across from him

BOBBY
What’s up

AARON
Bobby I’m sorry I’m so sorry
Bobby I was angry and I got caught
up in the moment It wasn’t right
And I should’ve never asked you not
to be yourself That was awful I
just panicked

BOBBY
Are you still hanging out with him
You must’ve hooked up with him

AARON
No Not at all He’s really sweet
but he’s really stupid Gay guys
can be really stupid remember

BOBBY
How could I forget

AARON
I miss you so much I know I fucked
up But this is new for me too
(MORE )
AARON (CONTD)
And you blew up in front of my
parents and I was embarrassed And
angry And to be honest it felt
like you were doing it on purpose

BOBBY
I was And I’m sorry that wasn’t
fair I shouldn’t have handled it
like that But that doesn’t change
the fact that you are infatuated
with a certain type of guy - and
that isn’t me

AARON
Look youre right - I always
pictured myself with a guy like -

BOBBY

Like Josh

AARON
Yes A guy like Josh

BOBBY
He’s hot Very symmetrical

AARON
He is hot And yes very
symmetrical Too symmetrical
Simple Conventional Basic as
hell Not someone that actually
makes me happy My whole life I’ve
always done what I thought I should
do never what I want to do Never
what really made me happy And you -
you are very different for me
Youre not afraid to take up space
in the world - and you challenge me
- which at the beginning freaked me
out because who the hell wants to
be challenged - but I love it
You’re what’s been missing I know
I fucked up but please accept my
apology and give me another chance
Please I miss you so much

BOBBY
I miss you too A lot I didn’t
realize until after we broke up
that there were actually a few
months there where I was - what do
they call it - in a good mood”

Aaron smiles and puts his hand on Bobby’s knee Bobby puts
his hand on Aaron’s hand gently

BOBBY (CONTD)
But no I can’t I’m sorry My
whole life I’ve prided myself on
being self-aware and self-
reliant and self-possessed And
it didn’t matter Because at the
end of the day I just ended up
in the street looking at you and
Josh and thinking “I’m not
enough for him” That is not who
I am

AARON
Bobby I’m sorry I feel awful But
don’t throw this away because of
one mistake That’s crazy

BOBBY

I don’t know what to tell you
AARON

Say youll give me another chance
BOBBY

I can’t
AARON

Why not
BOBBY

Because I don’t trust you
AARON

I love you
BOBBY

I love you too You made me realize
that maybe I am just another basic
bitch who wants some love in his
life As much as I hate to admit
it

AARON
I know And I’m here You’re gonna
ignore that and punish us forever
I mean what are we gonna do

BOBBY
I don’t know Go back to our lives
I guess

He looks back at Aaron Aaron stares back Bobby walks away

AARON
Hey

Bobby looks back at him Aaron has tears in his eyes

AARON (CONTD)
If you don’t trust me that’s fine
But if for some reason under all
that strength and all that
confidence you still don’t trust
that you’re lovable enough I’m
here to tell you I am living proof
that you’re wrong

Bobby takes that in a bit taken aback by how much Aaron
understands him But he turns and walks away

MELVIN FUNK
I’m not leaving my money to these
old queens

AARON

MELVIN FUNK

squeezes it gently After a beat Colman playfully slaps
Aaron’s butt

AARON
Now Mr Yiddlesworth that isn’t
appropriate

ANGLE ON ANGELA TAKING A SELFIE OF HERSELF WITH WANDA AND A112
BOBBY IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE TO AN EXHIBIT CALLED THE
GALLERY OF GENDER NON-CONFORMING ICONS 10000 BCE-2022

We see a monitor at the entrance with a video welcoming
people to it The video is a fast succession of 4-5 still
photos of genderfluidGNC people each with a chyron with
their name and the eralocation they lived in This short
montage is followed by the title THE GALLERY OF GENDER NON-
CONFORMING ICONS which is followed by the words POWERED BY
SHITROCKET which appear with some very aggro Redbull style
energy drink lightning bolt graphics ANGELA posts to IG

ANGELA
I swear those VR goggles are still
listening to me Instagram won’t
stop showing me ads for this guy
selling LGBTQ themed chocolates and
deserts One of them had a little
chocolate ice cream version of
Billie Jean King served inside a
waffle cone

Bobby realizes that must be Aaron she’s referring to Tina
approaches Bobby

TINA
Bobby seriously this place is
incredible Are you happy

BOBBY
Yeah I think so It’s weird This
was my dream and it actually
happened so why do I still not
know the answer to that question

Bobby holds up his phone and shows Tina Aaron’s text with
photos

BOBBY (CONTD)
I think he quit his job and started
making little chocolates Plus this
gingerbread Elliot Page Can you
believe it

TINA
OK can I say one thing I know what
he did was wrong But you didn’t
have to argue with his parents

BOBBY
I did though And I apologized

TINA
And he apologized too You both
fucked up I know you think there’s
no one you can really trust in the
world And I understand that But I
also know that this is supposed to
be the biggest night of your life
and you look miserable Is there no
part of you that wants to give him
a second chance

BOBBY
I don’t know You know what it
really is I don’t want to want
someone else this much

TINA
But you do Bobby it doesn’t make
you look weak to love someone
Vulnerability is NOT a boner
killer Were you happier with him
or without him That’s really all
that matters

Bobby thinks about that but doesn’t answer

BOBBY
Let’s just drop it ok

TINA
Ok Fine I’ve just never seen you
that happy And I loved seeing it

She looks at Bobby tenderly Edgar and the kids run up and
pull Tina to the dance floor Bobby watches alone from the
sidelines as his friends and all the board members dance We
see a MONTAGE of images playing in his head from his time
with Aaron He looks down at the photo of Aaron in the
chocolate shop struggling with whether or not to text him
Finally he decides to But he can’t decide what to write He
starts feverishly writing a long winded text about his
feelings - then he deletes it He starts writing something
funny and snarky - then he deletes that too He finds a
TREASURE INSIDE meme and almost sends that but changes his
mind Finally he settles on what to text and chooses these
IMMORTAL WORDS

BOBBY TEXT
HEY WHAT’S UP

INT AARON’S APARTMENT 112

Aaron and Jason play Duck Hunter Then Aaron gets the text

AARON
HOLY SHIT HE TEXTED ME BOBBY
TEXTED ME
JASON

AARON
He said “Hey What’s Up”
JASON
AHHHHH “HEY WHAT’S UP” FUCK

YEAH BRO
They both start cheering

AARON
Ok ok I’m gonna wait to text him
back I have to play it cool Oh
shit I’ve got the gym I gotta go

JASON
Aaron what the fuck is it with you

exactly are all you people training
for Are you going to war Bro
youve been running in place on a
treadmill every goddamn day for
years Stop playing it so fucking
cool You’re both so proud you’re
gonna ruin your lives forever Go
tell him how you feel

AARON
What about your divorce What about
never getting married and keeping
it young and fun

JASON
Whatever Straight people are so
weird and fucked up - we’re so set
in our ways You gay guys - you’re
all so smart You’1l figure it out
My story is not your story So go
make your own damn story GO NOW

EXT MANHATTAN - NIGHT 113

Aaron jogs through the city He jogs past a wall of FYC
posters for The Treasure Inside He sees a fleet of cabs with
taxi top ads for the LGBTQ MUSEUM He stares at them Then
he starts running as fast as he can Music Cue “Che Gelida
Manina” from La Bohéme (and The Treasure Inside)
Pink Rev (mmddyy) 126

INT MUSEUM OPENING NIGHT PARTY 114

WANDA
Bobby it’s time for the toast

Bobby looks down at his phone No response from Aaron He’s
disappointed Meanwhile outside

OMITTED 115

INT MUSEUM - STAGE 116
Bobby and the board stand on stage He addresses the crowd

BOBBY
One of the hardest parts of putting
the museum together was figuring
out what the final exhibit would
be the message we want to leave
people with about who we are But
the truth is we are not one thing
We are not a monolithic group We
are still angry and we are so
strong and we are selfish and we
are sad and we are lonely and we
are totally fine and we are all of
it We are the smartest most self-
reliant people you’ve ever met and
we are so stupid and we are a total
mess and we are great

(MORE )
BOBBY (CONTD)
We’ve been around since the

beginning of time and yet it feels
like we’re still at the beginning

of being able to tell our own
stories Isn’t that strange In
Many ways I think we’re still

getting to know each other really

So much of our history has been
denied and second guessed for so

long that believing it especially
love stories which we often don’t
have enough evidence to prove true -

it requires a leap of faith It

requires choosing not to focus on

doubt but to focus on the love

that you know in your heart had to

be there

Bobby sees Aaron in the crowd They make eye contact

smiles So happy to see him

BOBBY (CONTD)
Now I’m just a boring old cis
white gay but one thing I’ve
learned from my trans and bi and

non-binary family is that happiness

for all of us comes from staying

fluid staying open to change open

to evolution to being more than
one thing more than what you

thought you were or thought you
had to be You can allow yourself
to just be happy and not question

everything and not torture yourself
all the time That one’s tough for

me but I’m working on it We
finally did agree on a theme for
the final wing ALL THE

POSSIBILITIES So this is a toast

to all of us We’ve come a long
way (Bobby looks at the board)
And there are a lot of people who

deserved to live long enough to see
this And we are here And they are
not And we are very lucky We are

very lucky I have no complaints

Bobby

Bobby runs off stage through the crowd to meet Aaron

Suddenly Debra Messing runs up to Bobby

DEBRA MESSING
Bobby I just want to tell you --

BOBBY
In all my years Id never thought
Id say this but Debra Messing
it’1ll have to wait

He passes Debra and walks up to Aaron with tears in his eyes
BOBBY (CONTD)

I want you to know that I don’t
need you

AARON

Well I don’t need you either
BOBBY

Good But I really love you

Dammit
Bobby grabs Aaron and kisses him passionately

BOBBY (CONTD)
Youve been working so hard trying
to be a bro on the outside but I
realized that even though I’m like
the gayest person in the world
inside I’ve been trying too hard to
be strong and impenetrable too You
were trying to be a bro on the
outside But I was trying to be a
bro on the inside And I don’t want
to be that way anymore So

Bobby gets down on one knee in front of Aaron At this point
all the friends are gathered around them on the dance floor

AARON
Wait - what are you doing

BOBBY
Just let me do this Oh shit I
don’t have a ring

Bobby turns to Tamara who’s wearing a huge bejeweled ring

BOBBY (CONTD)
Tamara can I borrow that

Tamara gives it to Bobby and he gets down on his knee again

BOBBY (CONTD)
Aaron Shepard - I know we’re not
relationship people but - will you
date me for 3 months and then we’1ll
reassess

Aaron cracks up laughing

AARON
Yes Bobby Leiber Yes I will date
you for 3 months and then we’1ll
reassess

All of Bobby’s friends start crying and cheering

TINA’S DAUGHTER
Mommy what’s happening

TINA
(through happy tears)
It’s a miracle Uncle Bobby’s gonna
date someone for 3 months

Bobby slips Tamara’s huge ring on Aaron who shows it off to
the crowd and everyone cheers again Bobby dips Aaron and
they have a big movie kiss Suddenly we hear

GAY TWITTER WITCH 1
YUCK

Bobby and Aaron turn around It’s the GAY TWITTER WITCHES

BOBBY
Oh no The gay Twitter Witches
What are you doing here

GAY TWITTER WITCH 2
Of course we’re here We’re
everywhere

GAY TWITTER WITCH 3
What happened Bobby I thought you
said you were happy being alone I
thought you said on your podcast
you didn’t need anyone

BOBBY
Oh don’t believe any of the
bullshit I say on there

GAY TWITTER WITCH 1
Aaron Shepard in love with Bobby
Leiber Seems a little far fetched

Tina’s 8 year-old Brian walks up to the witches in awe

BRIAN
Excuse me Are you guys Gen Z
Pink Rev (mmddyy) 130

GAY TWITTER WITCH 2
That’s right sweetie

BRIAN
Wowww What’s it like being so old

The witches realize they are the old ones compared to Brian
They shriek in horror and literally START TO MELT LIKE THE
WICKED WITCH their outstretched hands holding their phones
being the last part to melt into the ground

BOBBY
Wait Aaron - the final wing

MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS 117

Bobby takes Aaron by the hand and they run towards the last
exhibit A sign above the room says ALL THE POSSIBILITIES

Just as they’re about to walk in they’re interrupted by a

hologram of BEN STILLER dressed up as a museum guard

BEN STILLER
Hey everyone I’m the museum guard
here Just gonna do some dusting

Ben dusts a bust of Eleanor Roosevelt Suddenly a hologram of
Eleanor Roosevelt (played by Amy Schumer) COMES ALIVE

ELEANOR ROOSEVELT
Hello What’re you doing dusting
me I’m lesbian first lady Eleanor
Roosevelt

HARVEY MILK
(played by Seth Meyers)
I’m Harvey Milk

JAMES BALDWIN
(played by Kenan Thompson)

BEN STILLER
It’s a Night at the Gay Museum

AARON
You ended up doing this You told
me you hated it

BOBBY
I did at first But Tamara grew up
with those movies and loved them
(MORE)

BOBBY (CONTD)
She said it would help make the
museum not - and I quote - “as
depressing as a dick”

INT MUSEEUM - CONTINUOUS 118

Bobby opens the door and leads Aaron into the exhibit a
gorgeous installation of stained glass windows like the ones
they saw on their first date - but this time featuring
diverse LGBTQ couples and families It shimmers

MUSIC CUE HEARTBREAKER by Mariah Carey

AARON
Do we have to dance

BOBBY
I’m afraid so

They run to the dance floor Bobby starts doing his stiff
dance where he barely moves In response Aaron starts doing
his awkward dance from the sail boat jumping and flailing
spastically all over the dance floor

Tom and Lucas dance holding their triplets Henry dances with
Lawrence Grape Tina and Edgar dance with their kids We pan
over to see Peter Paul and Marty locked in a deep three-way
kiss right next to them

The camera sails around the room We see portraits of real
LGBTQ people from past time periods - not icons just real
people looking down over everyone ending on the Egyptian
hieroglyphic of a gay couple from the start of the film
Bobby and Aaron kiss beneath them

ANGLE ON the GAY TWITTER WITCHES now alive again and vogue-
ing on the dance floor

GAY TWITTER WITCH 1
Imagine thinking we would ever die

GAY TWITTER WITCH 2
Oh my god you have to tweet that

They all cackle and dance
FADE TO BLACK THE END

Over End Credits

119 INT MUSEUM - CHYRON 3 MONTHS LATER 119

Bobby and Aaron look up at the stained glass exhibit Then
Aaron’s mom followed by her second grade class walks in on
a tour led by Wanda The kids look up at the windows in awe

AARON’S MOM
Bobby

Bobby and Aaron’s mom hug

AARON’S MOM (CONTD)
My god Bobby this is spectacular
And the kids are loving it

BOBBY
Thank you I’m so glad you’re here
It means so much to me that you’d
make it part of your trip

AARON’S MOM
Of course I’1l1 admit when you
first mentioned it I wasn’t sure
about bringing the kids But you
were right Of course they should
see this It’s their history too

A precocious judge-y second grade boy - looking and sounding
a lot like a young Bobby Leiber - pipes up

JUDGE-Y YOUNG BOY
I don’t know It looks nice but
it’s so sentimental
Bobby laughs looks down and whispers to the kid
BOBBY
Honestly I said the same thing

Not everyone is on our level

JUDGE-Y YOUNG BOY
Well what else is new

Bobby looks back up at the windows taking them in
BOBBY
They are pretty though
120 EXT OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM 120

Bobby and Aaron wave goodbye from the museum steps as Aaron’s
mom puts the kids on the school bus

AARON
You know we just hit 3 months How
do you think it’s going
Bobby looks at Aaron and smiles

BOBBY
I think it’s going really well

AARON
I think it’s going really well too

A beat as they watch the last of the kids hop on the bus

AARON (CONTD)
You want kids someday right

Bobby is horrified

BOBBY
Oh no
AARON
Bobby
BOBBY
Oh absolutely not -
AARON
C’mon
BOBBY
No No

Bobby runs down the steps jokingly running away from Aaron

AARON
Wait Where are you going

Aaron chases after Bobby He catches up to him and they
laugh As they walk off Bobby throws his arm around Aaron
Then Aaron throws his arm around Bobby They walk off as Marc
