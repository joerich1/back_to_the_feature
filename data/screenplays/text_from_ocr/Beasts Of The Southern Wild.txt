EXT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - DAWN
An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall
oil drums Distant thunder trembles through the peeling
metal panels The structure is in such disrepair that

surely no one lives here

But then a light goes on

INT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - MORNING

A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed
on the floor We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a
baby chicken that appears to be dead This is HUSHPUPPY an
unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze
unmistakable wisdom

Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole like a

on her throne and the chick twitches to life cheeps twice
Hushpuppys esoteric science experiment is interrupted by

DISTANT THUNDER Her eyes stand to attention

cut To

EXT SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY

An eerie harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant
slumbering pot-belly pig

Hushpuppy donned in boys underpants and a child-sized

beater tip-toes behind the epic creature She studies it
wonderful is this the source of the thunder
With the utmost delicacy she lays a hand on the pigs

belly
We hear his HUGE BEATING HEART
CUT TO
EXT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - VARIOUS
A series of glimpses of Hushpuppys scientific method She
chases geese chickens ducks dogs around the property- a
cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard
Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear A TINY
HEARTBEAT She listens with focused wonder and intensity

HUSHPUPPY (VO)
All the time everywhere
everythings organs be beatin and
squirtin and talkin to each other
in ways I cant understand Mosta
the time they probably just sayin
Im hungry or I gotta poop
but sometimes they talkin in
codes
Hushpuppys eyes dart up as a MANS VOICE yells-
MANS VOICE (0S)
Get up get out of here
We hear a YOWL as a cat is flung across the room
A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson
Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris
and discarded appliances
A wild man with severe features a frazz of unkempt hair
and
brawlers scars opens a window made from a metal sign This
is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET known to all as WINK WINK
Get your pants on man
Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall
into
a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched

feet down to the ground The net is overflowing with beer
the

food

of

throws

cans

EXT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - DAY

Hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger
and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder up to the
door of her house

EXT SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY

We now see Wink in his morning ritual He opens a cooler
with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on

grill
He goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog
He pulls a clothesline that leads to Hushpuppys trailer A

BELL RINGS

WINK
Feed up time Feed up

Hushpuppy now wearing pants and a slightly more proper T-
shirt comes running down the oil barrels to her house She
echoes her Daddy

HUSHPUPPY
Feed up time Feed up
INT ABANDONED BUS - DAY
Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands
getting right in there like it was a candy apple It looks

really yummy

Pigs dogs chickens and cats are chowing down all around
her

A hatch opens above her and we realize were in the bottom
the Shacko Wink sticks his head through the hatch and
corn to the chickens

WINK
Share with the dogs

Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a
filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body
This is WINDELL in spite of her circumstances quite a
handsome young pup

EXT BATHTUB MARSH WATER - THE TURCK - EVENING

WIDE we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh
They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil
drums A motor is strapped to the back A sign on the boat
reads The Turck Hushpuppys spelling of Truck

They look out to where the water goes all the way to a
monolithic 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the
distance This levee the first piece of modern

construction

from

with

tree

weve seen encloses the civilized world protecting it
rising water The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall
Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall
a peaceful and confident disdain

Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression

WINK
Aint that ugly over there

He takes a long pull on his beer

WINK (CONTD)
We live in the prettiest place on
earth

Hushpuppy looks over the wall to the Dry Side Its an
endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a

or bird in sight This is the engine that runs the Northern
world

HUSHPUPPY (VO)

Daddy says up above the levee on
the dry side theyre afraid of the
water like a bunch of babies They
built the wall that cuts us off
land

of

de

wives

EXT AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY
We fly over marsh and water coming upon a tiny crop of

shanties on an island perched at the very bottom of the

HUSHPUPPY (VO)
They think we all gonna drown down
here But we aint goin nowhere

cut To

EXT CAUSEWAY - PRE-FLOOD - DAY

CLOSE ON Hushpuppy letting out a WARRIOR SCREAM in a mass
HOLLERING people

They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both
sides by water The rag tag band of revelers charge forward

WHOOPING and SHOUTING

Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign Isle

Charles Doucet is crossed out and someone has graffitied
The Bathtub Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppys kiss and
smack in wild ritualistic fashion

HUSHPUPPY (VO)

The Bathtubs got more holidays

than the whole rest of the world

EXT LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY

The townspeople charge in a rousing parade Everyone drags
trails of beer cans boat parts anything they can tie to
themselves that makes a lot of noise

They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty

downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them a
community of heart spirit passion and reckless abandon

We see none of the separations that were used to in modern
society There is no evidence of politics religion class
race or any other divisive ideology The Bathtub is a place
of true and honest unity
Cajun

truck

into

the

diaper
on

are

Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the

band playing inside Fiddle saw guitar and double-bass
players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the

bounces them down a dirt road

They drive under a banner reading Welcome to the Bathtub
Storm Season

Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the
front end of a pickup truck Over the front cabin rears a
giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes
metal plates and heavy chains Carnival-dressed maniacs
clamber on top

Wink hollers and waves to people He fires jets of beer

the mouths of the crowd

Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float Though shes the
tiniest member of this very adult parade shes right in

thick of everything No one is checking IDs Here
HUSHPUPPY (VO)
Daddy always saying that up in the
dry world they got none of what we
got
EXT LAFOURCHE SQUARE - DAY
The town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods
Everyone is bouncing to the music smiling and joking with
one another
HUSHPUPPY (VO)
They only got holidays once a year

Six babies each with a racing number pinned to their
are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting-line
a track marked by two adjacent crowds of onlookers Bets

flying between the spectators as if theyre about to watch

cock-fight
of

one

ANNOUNCER (VO)

All babies to the race Come up to
the starting line The baby race
is about to begin

Hushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd swigging a bottle
something she probably shouldnt have

A STARTING GUN fires and the babies make a crawl for it
Most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment but

brave soul toddles towards victory

HUSHPUPPY (VO)

They got fish stuck in plastic
wrappers they got their babies
stuck in carriages and chickens on
sticks and all that kind of stuff

Hushpuppy looks up at Wink who is dancing with his best
friend WALRUS a slack jawed white haired pinked
nosed handsome devil

A baby crosses the finish line ahead of the rest
victorious The crowd goes wild

EXT MARINA PAUPIER NET - NIGHT

Wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a
picking pan Theres food to feed a hundred in the haul No
one is a bit fazed though this is just your average night
fishing in the Bathtub

Shrimp crabs and small leaping fish struggle over one
another for dear life

Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch Winkss hands move with
virtuosic ease separating the crabs from the shrimp She
studies Winks every move and tries to measure up to her
Dads proficiency He doesnt demonstrate or explain
anything but we sense there is a system of education in
place here

Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish wriggling and sucking
its last breaths of air

HUSHPUPPY (VO)
One day the storms gonna blow
unbridled

laugh

faces

display

the grounds gonna sink and the
waters gonna rise up so high
there aint gonna be no Bathtub
just a whole bunch of water

She pick up a crab pets its belly The DIN of the party
fades down around her as she listens to its HEARTBEAT

EXT LADY JOS CYPRESS FOREST - NIGHT

Explosions everywhere as Bathtubers rampage blasting
fireworks down the street instead of into the air Men
dressed as women women dressed as men in some kind of
reckless esoteric ritual

The SCORE kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding
We sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy the

joy that a cloud hangs over this community The people are
parting like its there last day on earth and we feel
viscerally that it could be

Hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind Wink waving a
fountain sparkler Wink trips and falls

Wink lies on his back on the ground He sees his daughter
watching him holding the huge sparkler and they both

with sheer joy

Hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his
face the fuse burning He nods his approval They watch
the fuse burn down to the last moment She turns it upward
and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming
mortars

Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Winks

Hes momentarily peaceful admiring the spectacular

Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride He doesnt see her

They run off into the crowd which is pulsating at the
pinnacle of mayhem The OMINOUS MUSIC shifts gears into a
BLASTING PATRIOTIC HYMN of the Bathtub Throw your fist in
the air These are the survivors those who fight for their
joy and their history to the last man

both

out

holes-

battle

HUSHPUPPY (VO)
But me and my Daddy we stay right
here We who the earth is for

Hushpuppy runs right at us with detonating fireworks in

hands engulfed by light She swings them toward camera and
the screen is engulfed in an inferno of sparks A white

Black letters slam down

BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD

INT SCHOOLBOAT - MORNING

MUSIC CUTS abruptly as a basket of crawfish is slammed in
front of camera The crawfish squirming and struggling for
life engulfs the screen

WOMANS VOICE
Meat

A fearsome uncompromising leader sexy like a lady
bullfighter peeks at Hushpuppy over a mass of squirming
crawfish This is MISS BATHSHEBA She points to three students pushing their heads with her
finger each time announcing

MISS BATHSHEBA
MEAT MEAT MEAT

The twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures
caged in mason jars basins and boxes with breathing

her educational tools

MISS BATHSHEBA (CONTD)

Every animal is made out of meat

I am meat yall asses meat
Everything is part of the buffet of
the universe

Miss Bathsheba rolls up the leg of her skirt

MISS BATHSHEBA (CONTD)
This here is an Aurochs

Riding her thigh is tattooed a scene much like a cave
painting in Lascaux In thick black ink it depicts a
between early men wielding spears and giant bull-like
animals bearing down over them

MISS BATHSHEBA (CONTD)

A fierce mean creature that roamed
the earth back when we all lived in
caves They would gobble the cave-
babies down right in front of their
cave-parents And the cavemen
couldnt do nothing about it
because they were too poor too
stupid too small Who here thinks
the Cavemen were sitting around
crying like a buncha pussies

Children stare blankly no one raises their hand

Hushpuppy watches a heroic crawfish crest the basket fall
to
the floor and make a run for it

Miss Bathsheba snatches up the rogue crawdad and flings it
back into the vat

MISS BATHSHEBA (CONTD)

Yall better think about that
Cause any day now the fabric of
the universe is coming unraveled
The ice caps gonna melt the
waters gonna rise and everything
south of the levees going under

She points to a map showing a ragged coastline On the
wrong

side of a giant line marked levee is an island labeled
The

Bathtub

MISS BATHSHEBA (CONTD)

Aint gonna be no Bathtub just a
whole bunch of water Yall better
learn to survive

A mysterious COLD WIND fills the air Hushpuppy stares into
a wall poster of an ice cliff reading THE SOUTH POLE

HUSHPUPPY (VO)
Way back in the day the Aurochs
was king of the world
real

the

looking

EXT ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY
CRASH CUT to the PANORAMA of an ice cliff but now its

We CUT CLOSER to overwhelming white light accompanied by
intermittent FROZEN CRACKS that build in frequency and
volume
HUSHPUPPY (VO)
If it wasnt for giant snowballs
and the iced age I wouldnt even
be Hushpuppy I would just be
breakfast
The light dims in intensity to reveal frozen deep inside
ice wall barely visible- a fanged hairy bloated stone
aged creature the same as on Miss Bathshebas leg This is
an Aurochs
INT EXT SHACKO IN THE BACKO - EVENING
Hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing up to
Winks shanty in the trees Windell her dirty Chihuahua

follows behind

HUSHPUPPY

Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko

HUSHPUPPY (CONTD)

She goes inside
The house is empty

She checks the Shacko for food Nothing

EXT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - EVENING

Several hours later Hushpuppy stands on a metal bin
into the distance

HUSHPUPPY
DADDY

Like some sort of animal call she SHRIEKS

INT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - NIGHT
Hushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress
HUSHPUPPY (VO)
Kids that got no Mamma no Daddy
and nobody They got to live in
the woods and eat grass and steal

underpants

Hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink

EXT SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING

Windell the Chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet
the day

Hushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko

HUSHPUPPY
Daddy Daddy

No response

HUSHPUPPY (V0O) (CONTD)

If Daddy dont get home soon its

gonna be time for me to start

eating my pets

EXT SCHOOLBOAT - DAY

Kids walk home with their parents after a day at the
Schoolboat which we now see is big a yellow houseboat
floating on the bayou

Hushpuppy waits alone no one has come to get her

Miss Bathsheba locks up the door and heads for her small
motor boat tied off on the side of the school

MISS BATHSHEBA
You need a ride boo

HUSHPUPPY
My Daddys coming to pick me up

MISS BATHSHEBA
How about food or something you
hungry

Hushpuppy shakes her head “no

Miss Bathshebas doesnt totally believe her but shes not
the type to coddle either

MISS BATHSHEBA (CONTD)
Alright well suit yourself

Miss Bathsheba motors away

Hushpuppy waits until shes out of sight and starts

walking

INT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - MORNING

Playing dont-touch-the-floor Hushpuppy navigates her
house

The room has with holes in the walls blocked with old
clothes

and paper towels Homemade toys fill every surface This is

the domain of a child at loose ends

Hushpuppy leaps over her bed- a nook piled with clothes-
and

plugs in the Christmas lights

HUSHPUPPY (V0O)
Everything we still got from Mamma
we keep in my house

We push in on a shrine to her mother

A red basketball jersey An apron A sawed-off shotgun A
childs drawing of a beautiful lady

HUSHPUPPY (VO) (CONTD)

Daddy says the first time she
looked at me it made her heart
beat so big that she thought it
in

speaking
an

her

ties

would blow up Thats why she swam
away

Hushpuppy takes the jersey down She puts it over a chair
the dining area

Hushpuppy gets a can of cat food A pot Water in a bowl
Her actions have a sad sense of routine to them- shes been
left alone before and has her own self-invented system for
feeding herself

She opens a can of cat food takes it out with her hand and

throws it in a pot She licks the remnants off her finger

MARIETTAS VOICE
Hi my sweet baby

HUSHPUPPY
Hi momma

MARIETTA Hushpuppys imaginary invisible mamma is
from the basketball jersey chair Marietta functions like
imaginary friend- Hushpuppy is the only one who can see
Hushpuppy takes the pot puts it on the stove

MARIETTAS VOICE
Hushpuppy what you doing there

You being good like I taught you

HUSHPUPPY
Yes mamma

Hushpuppy turns on the gas

Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions oven mitts
helmet she flips the table and hides behind it

She aims the stove lighter a flame thrower made from a
cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant A spray of
flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL

cut To

MOMENTS LATER Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove She
on an apron and sways to the music She is dressing like
her
mom

Mariettas Voice sings to her

MARIETTAS VOICE
Youre good you make me happy
youre good you make me happy

HUSHPUPPY
Thats pretty Mamma

MARIETTAS VOICE
Youre pretty Hushpuppy

Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food

frying
in fat which in her POV is a surreal churning vision like
the bubbling lava at the center of the earth

Shes SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being
flung
across the yard

WINK (0S)
Get out of my way you fat animal

Hushpuppy jumps down from the stove grabs a bowl of water
and runs to greet Wink

EXT WINKS COMPOUND - MORNING

She clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water
everywhere in her excitement

HUSHPUPPY
Daddy Daddy Daddy

Wink doesnt turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across
the

field toward his Shacko Hes wearing a hospital patients

smock and no shoes it seems he checked himself out

HUSHPUPPY (CONTD)
I learned lots of stuff while you

Hushpuppy whacks Winks butt

HUSHPUPPY (CONTD)
I WANNA COME IN YOUR HOUSE

Wink fakes like hes gonna smack her

WINK
GO AHEAD

Hushpuppy tears off

Wink storms into the Shacko in the Backo

INT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - DAY

Hushpuppy stomps inside Her cat food is burning

Hushpuppy gulps down water all of it Wink keeps walking
Hushpuppy BURPS like a man but he doesnt turn around

Hushpuppy stops to examine the situation Somethings not

Hushpuppy tugs his patients smock and he shrugs her off

with

jetting up to the ceiling She thinks about it fora

and turns the burner up Smoke billows
jumps

them

Hushpuppy grabs her basketball jersey off the chair and

over the breakfront counter Behind her A MASSIVE GREASE
EXPLOSION

Hushpuppy ducks down panicking She check over the median
The stove is on engulfed in flames

Hushpuppy scrambles under a cardboard box

INT EXT HUSHPUPPYS BOX - DAY

The walls of the box are decorated with years of her
drawings In here she feels a strange safety The FLAMES
and BREAKING WINDOWS feel distant and muffled

She draws a hieroglyphic of herself sad and crying on an
island with a sun and a palm tree

She peeks out as Wink runs into the house which is filled
with black smoke flickering flames

W
(panicking from inside)
Hushpuppy Boss lady Hushpuppy
where you at

Hushpuppy drops the box closed Smoke billows into the box
filling it up

HUSHPUPPY (V0O)

If Daddy kill me I aint gonna be
forgotten Im recording my story

for the scientists of the future

Hushpuppy draws a bigger figure giving her a hug as Winks
panicked fury intensifies outside

WINK (0S)
HUSHPUPPY Where are you Boss

HUSHPUPPY (V0O)

In a million years when kids go to
school they gonna know that once
there was Hushpuppy and she lived
with her Daddy in the Bathtub

Wink pulls Hushpuppys drawings off the walls he flings
on

out the door to safety
Hushpuppy coughs
Wink has heard He looks toward the box

WINK
BOSS LADY

Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it flying out the door

WINK (CONTD)
Dont you run away from me I
swear to GOD Hushpuppy

EXT HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - DAY
Hushpuppy runs out of Winks compound into the woods Wink

her trail In the background the house is a towering
inferno

EXT TRAIL BEHIND WINKS COMPOUND - DAY
They run deeper into the swamp

HUSHPUPPY
Im tearing off

WINK
You aint tearing off nothin Ill

bust your ass

HUSHPUPPY
Im tearing off just like my Momma

WINK
Come on

Wink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses
She digs her heels in

WINK (CONTD)
See what happens See what happens

to you

Hushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on
Wink slaps Hushpuppy and she falls face down
He looks away disgusted with himself
WINK (CONTD)
See what you making me do Youre
killing me

He reaches down and tries to pick her up

WINK (CONTD)
Get up and now come on

Hushpuppy jumps up on her own
HUSHPUPPY

I hope you do die And after you

die I come to your grave and eat

birthday cake all by myself

Hushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly EVERYTHING

GOES QUIET as if all the insects in the forest have
hushed

All at once we hear--

A HUMAN HEART beating until there is a SONIC BOOM an
earsplitting CRACK of glacial ice

Hushpuppy turns toward the sound When she turns back

Winks
face has transformed wrenches with fear and pain
Wink keels over clutching his arm

Hushpuppy stares her breath accelerating

Winks eyes roll back in his head he begins to seizure

ANOTHER GLACIAL CRACK rings out The SPLITTING builds to a

DEAFENING ROAR She covers her ears

EXT ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF WOODS - DAY

Fissures appear like lightning through the massive ice
cliff

from the opening of the movie

Hushpuppy runs from the sound hands over her ears We
INTERCUT with shots of falling glaciers The universe is
coming unravelled

An ice shelf COLLAPSES into the ocean in a MASSIVE
AVALANCHE
a wave rolls toward camera

EXT GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY

The wave now just a tiny ripple hits Hushpuppys feet

Suddenly the water level rises around her It overtakes
her

knees and keeps going Hushpuppy backs up to shore

terrified

Hushpuppy calls out to a distant beacon flashing on the
horizon

HUSHPUPPY
Momma Momma MOMMA I think
I broke something

EXT SCHOOLBOAT - DAY

Hushpuppy runs out of the woods toward school in a total
panic

In front of the school parents pile their children into a
pickup trucks and vans

HUSHPUPPY
Miss Bathsheba Miss Bathsheba
My Daddy fell down

Miss Bathsheba takes Hushpuppys hands as she tries to
catch

her breath to speak Clutched in her hand is the hospital

bracelet that Wink had been wearing

Bathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it
her eyes widen in recognition and alarm

INT SCHOOLBOAT - DAY

Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba frantically pull herbs and
roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it
into a large medicine jar
MISS BATHSHEBA
Its gonna be OK baby

Bathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar

MISS BATHSHEBA (CONTD)

Ok Hushpuppy heres what I need
you to do You take this medicine
and run as fast as you can Go

EXT SWAMP CLEARING - DAY

We see glimpses of nature protecting itself from the
impending disaster Flowers curl up insects horde food
underground RUSTLING sounds fill the air Black birds and
bats and all manner of flying creatures fill the sky
Theyre all getting the hell out of dodge

Hushpuppy quaking with fear runs through a menacing swamp
clutching her medicine jar The rising winds swirl the

marsh

grass all around her

Hushpuppy runs to the spot where Wink collapsed

Hes gone

Hushpuppy looks around the swamp unable to understand

HUSHPUPPY (VO)

Daddy could have turned into a

tree or a bug There wasnt any

way to know

Hushpuppy hides her medicine jar in her storage unit- a

leather flap laid over the hollow of an oak tree The
hollow

is filled with trinkets and objects shes collected over
the

years

Hushpuppy flinches as a shrieking animal calls out

She looks up to see a leaf covered in writhing
caterpillars

One of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting
for

its life

little

of

herself

band

HUSHPUPPY (VO)

The whole universe depends on
everything fitting together just
right If one piece busts even
the smallest piece the entire
universe will get busted

EXT ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY
Blocks of glaciers roll out of the avalanche and away from
Antarctica like floating ice cubes Embedded in each cube
is an Aurochs
A single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead
Aurochs eye stares right at us Its jaw wide its fangs
bared the ferocious beast appears to have fossilized mid-
pounce THUNDER BOOMS
We drift upwards into the cloud cover As we rise above the
white canopy the spiral of a hurricane forms
EXT LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY
STRINGS SWELL under HOWLING WINDS We follow behind a
boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people
the Bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation

BOY
The storms coming The storms
coming
EXT LADY JOS BAR - DAY
Hushpuppy sulks out of the woods feeling sorry for
She looks up and freezes like shes seen a ghost
Wink hobbles down the road looking shell-shocked The
traffic on the road moves in one direction out Wink walks

back into town in the opposite direction

In Hushpuppys POV Wink arrives at Lady Jos bar where a

of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions They
are watching the evacuation go by like its a Veterans Day
parade They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out toa
family making their way to safety

LITTLE JO

LITTLE JO

WINSTON is passed out on the stairs

Without opening his eyes Winston raises an umbrella over
his
head Wink laughs

WALRUS

They burst into a round of drunken applause

WINK
Hushpuppy Where you been

HUSHPUPPY

WINK
Shut-up

He lifts her up by the britches and carries her away

WINK (CONTD)
You dont talk

INT EXT SHACKO IN THE BACKO - GROUND FLOOR - DAY

Through the bus window Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for
the storm as branches and debris fly by him He RANTS to
himself and drinks He ties the Turck onto the house

Hushpuppy looks to where her animals lurch and freeze run
around in circles pant heavily They feel it coming

Rain drops start to spatter the window and Wink trips and
falls trying to catch a fleeing chicken

INT EXT SHACKO IN THE BACKO - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHT

Now the full force of the storm HOWLS and CLATTERS the
shutters Rain screams against the corrugated metal roof

Wink tapes padding over all sharp corners and plastic wraps
the furniture Hes Hushpuppy-proofing everything

He runs a piece of duct tape across the floor

WINK
This side is still Winks house
No toys and no girl stuff over
here

Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppys house across the
line

WINK (CONTD)
So if I want to come over that side
and smack you in the face thats
against the rules So theres a
plus for you

Hushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here

WINK (CONTD)
Now come on down here and get in
the boat man

He points to a trunk on the floor Hushpuppy hops down and
gets in Wink sits on his air mattress

WINK (CONTD)
If the water get real high we
gonna float to the top and we gonna
bust through the roof and we gonna
ride away okay

Wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her

WINK (CONTD)
You never NEVER take these off
Im your Daddy and you do what I
tell you to do because its my job
to keep you from dying ok So sit
back and just listen to me
Close your eyes and go to sleep
CLOSE YOUR EYES

Hushpuppy watches Wink pretending to sleep The THUNDER
scares the bejesus out of him again

She looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in
steadily

Looks back at Wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor
bottle He resumes his phony sleep

A strong gust of wind JOLTS the entire room and he springs
out of bed

WINK (CONTD)
Why you starin at me like that I
cant sleep with you starin at me
like that

Wink paces the floor

WINK (CONTD)
in

Listen You need to understand
youre a kid and Im a man

She doesnt understand

WINK (CONTD)
What you scared

Hushpuppy nods THUNDER BOOMS and Wink is the one who
flinches

WINK (CONTD)
Dont be scared no storm cant
beat no Doucet Im gonna show
you You watch

But he can see shes still scared
WINK (CONTD)

Imll show you We Doucets were
not scared of no damn storm

Wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch
the floor into the storm
Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out

OUTSIDE The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full

CUT TO

EXT PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT

Still in the rainstorm a glacial cube SHATTERS flopping a
mammoth body onto the shoreline

Its chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard The animal
begins to roll over

Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts

herself
up We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she
stares into the distance
The massive creature turns testing her limbs after
thousands
of years of sleep
She looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR
We sit close on one of her black eyes There is something
dangerously sad in her cold gaze Her head moves from the
frame as she starts forward on her journey
EXT AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY
Silence The storm has passed
The camera flies high over the Bathtub The tops of houses
poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond
EXT SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING
A slab of metal stares at us surrounded by water
Something under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges
a

roof panel The axe twists and leverages off the slab

Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof Then Windell
Dishevelled and hung-over he pulls himself up too

The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new
on

girl

EXT FLOODED LAFOURCHE ROAD - TURCK - MORNING

Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded
landscape where their town had once been Neither he nor
Hushpuppy can say a word Everything is submerged Every

organism is dead or has fled The quiet is overwhelming

HUSHPUPPY (VO)

For every animal that didnt have a

Dad to put it in a boat the end of

the world already happened

tablecloth on it Shes drawing on the floor with charcoal

Something alive hits the roof and scurries across We hear
the entire house MOAN or was it a distant ROAR

HUSHPUPPY
Daddy

Winks hacking cough which has gotten worse since last we
heard it fills the room Hushpuppy tries to shake him
awake
Hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt

On Winks chest surrounding his heart a corroded spider

of purple bruises shows through the skin like varicose

covering his entire heart

Hushpuppys eyes go wide with horror
strewn

EXT EDISONS HOUSE - NIGHT

The beacon pulses on the distant horizon

HUSHPUPPY

EXT DESERT - DAY

A cloud of dust circulates particles The Haze is blinding
A distant RUMBLING grows

Dark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede
HUSHPUPPY (VO)

hungry and they start coming

We see one at first then more join rank around it The

Aurochs are charging in a pack They are a biblical terror
the horsemen of the apocalypse

EXT LADY JOS BAR - DAY
The turck moves through the cypress forest signs are

everywhere pointing to Lady Jos bar It appears abandoned

Suddenly the door SQUEAKS open Walrus winces at the
sunlight and pops a beer

He steps out the door and SPLASHES into the water

WALRUS
Holy bowlegged Sarah

WINK
Hey partner Hey Walrus

Wink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing
drunkard
They leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck
WALRUS

(gauging his surroundings)

Wink starts chuckling silently His chuckle builds to a
laugh

INT LADY JOS BAR - FLOODED - DAY

They enter the bar empty bottles half eaten crabs and

INT LADY JOS BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

The Bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages
There is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober
creature in the room by far

WALRUS
If I had wings I know I could have
flown in that bad boy But I would
have probably bounced off a tree
Or

Hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells

WINK
Hushpuppy Did I ever tell you the
story of your conception

The bar crowd chuckles
WINK (CONTD)

When me and Hushpuppys Mamma first
met we was so shy we used to sit
perfect

around and drink beer and smile

at each other One day we was so

shy we just napped

Winks voice FADES DOWN as Hushpuppys fantasy takes over
She closes her eyes

EXT FANTASY HUSHPUPPYS HOUSE - DAY

Wink younger and prettier naps in an uncharacteristically
colorful lawn chair

A LOW GURGLING GROWL wakes him up
There in the yard crawling slow and lazy is a massive 15-
foot alligator breathing the heavy slutty way alligators
breathe

A topless woman steps in front Sweat beading on her

shoulder blades down her perfect back ending in a pair of
boys underpants- just like Hushpuppys

Throughout Hushpuppys vision we never see Mariettas
its always covered shot from the back or out of frame

Marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand Terminator 2

Lowers it on the gator

BLAM Wink sits up in SLOW MOTION- her panties and her
naked legs are covered with gator blood

She turns to Wink her head ABOVE FRAME

determination Filling with all the strength and heroism of

EXT FLOODED BATHTUB - THE TURCK - DAY

ENERGETIC MUSIC drops and we move in a semi-montage through
Hushpuppys search for survivors

Hushpuppy rows the Turck through the flooded Bathtub by
herself In the distance she sees a lone horse It stands
on an tiny island of land the last high ground in an
stretch of water

The horse holds Hushpuppys gaze She hears its strong
resilient HEARTBEAT They are one and the same

table assembled from many different tables

WINK
Come on lets go Time to eat

He sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table
where Joy T-Lou and Lizard dig in

Wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics
the Bathtub

The room is a shrine of peoples chairs umbrellas

Were late in the game and the party has descended into
utter debauchery

Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean a good pupil

JEAN BATTISTE (CONTD)
Here baby You hold like this

Hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration but a
bit tentative

We see Wink look away from Walrus and Jos bawdy humor
extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy His disdain is
palpable for this froufrou shelling technique

JEAN BATTISTE (CONTD)

Dont be scared of it now Now

this off

Jean holds Hushpuppys hand and guides a knife to open the
belly of the crab

JEAN BATTISTE (CONTD)

Wink pushes the utensil away He grabs a crab opens it in
three virtuosic hand motions

of the crab clean It is beautiful to watch

He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy

triumphant

EXT BRAZILIAN FAVELLAS - DAY

A quiet town not unlike the Bathtub but with tangled
re
lines electrical towers and layered hills

A stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the
street denting the silence

Slowly the peaceful morning transitions into MORE
LING
a distant CRACK

Suddenly the house in the foreground explodes to
hereens

Without breaking step Aurochs maraud the village

it into oblivion We settle close on an Aurochs eye
emotionless and relentless in its calm

Hushpuppy shakes her head “no

SERGEANT MAJOR (CONTD)
Theyre good for you

A deep far away melancholy settles over him He munches on
a chicken biscuit then tosses the wrapper on the floor

The

Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry
of doting ladies They are not who she is looking for They
are not who she is looking for

She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up
all over the ceiling each of them with a bra hung on it
none of them right

Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes
ladies smile and return to their drinks drunk flirtatious
dancers giggle at her but she remains unfazed

something inaudible

The Cook squeezes her tight seeming on the verge of

then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze

Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying

The Aurochs lowers her head with respect

Her eyes well with emotion recognizing one of her own A
ferocious warrior

The Aurochs steps back takes a knee and with a BELLY FLOP
that rattles the very earth she lays down Her three
companions follow suit their fat tummies settling into an
almost joyful lazy repass

A strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy Almost a smile
but more of a peace and an affection for her equal Theyre

Wink motions for her to come closer

Hushpuppy inches toward him It takes all of her might She
sits on his bed

Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out
of a paper bag and pops it She unwraps a gator nugget

it in hot sauce and holds it out for Wink to take a bite

take

a hopeful turn the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the
