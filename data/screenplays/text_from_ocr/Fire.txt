The gixl is crying openly now the pain of JAKEs
rejection is too much She gets up and stumbles out
of the club

JAKE watches her leave a sorrowful expression momentarily
erosses his face Hes hurt her but she was warned He
looks back into the crowd Another girl catches his eye

JAKE
(singing)
Theres a darkness comin into town --
A darkness thats nowhere found

She smiles deeply back at him moving her body to the
music

JAKE
(singing)
Beware to those who feel its beat --
Cover your eyes and still your feet

The girl sways sensuously with the throbbing beat JAKE
stares at her body -- then shuts his eyes as the droning
sounds from the band build to a sexual climax

Suddenly were in JAKEs dressing room between sets
JAKE opens the door and the girl stands in the room
waiting for him She is moving her hands across her
body JAKE walks towards her She begins to slowly
unbutton her blouse revealing her breasts firm full
and damp with sweat JAKE bends his head to kiss them
The girl stops him firmly clamping her hands on both

lips mouth Say you love me JAKE smiles and kisses
her hard on the mouth JAKEs eyes jerk open Hes

stand and glares down at her legs braced

JAKE
(singing)

Everybodys been burned before -
Everybody knows the pain --
Anyone in this place --
Can tell you to your face --
Why you shouldnt love anymore
Everybody knows it never works --
Everybody knows and me --

Jake knew what he was doing even
when he didnt know what he was
doing That was part of his
genius man He made everything
look like it was happening for
the first time -- that instance
-- that moment He fooled them
all

DAVE
So you dont think hes dead

SHEP

Killin’ yourself because youre
facing a prison sentence aint
very funny - But foolin the
whole world into thinking youre
dead so you can disappear and
be what you always wanted --

(laughing)
Now thats a good one

DAVE
What about the death certificate

taken which would be the first normal impulse of any
male She holds a tiny mike connected to a portable

notebook

ANNIE
Do you consider yourself a sex

symbol
JAKE takes a long thoughtful pause before answering

JAKE

No just a phallic symbol You
see I started out a full man
with a cock like anybody else
-- just one organ among many
But when I get up on stage I
strip away all those other parts
I dont pretend theres anything
else I am pure sex Just one
huge cock

(with a wry smile)
Now the question is -- and its
very important for our relation-

ANNIE is now too wrapped up in her tears to notice the
grotesque visage behind her And even if she turned to
face JAKE he would be gone Because JAKE has expended
his last energy reserves to manage this appearance

singing on the radio

So thats when he wrote Wreck

ANNIE
Yes Shep hated it Told Jake
he was a singer and he should
leave the writing to him
Thats why they broke up

DAVE
Shep told me it was because he
got drunk and crazy and ruined
the music

ANNIE
Sure he got drunk and crazy
because Shep wouldnt let him

do his song and when he finally
did the crowd wasnt interested

They wanted the sexual wild
possessed reveler They didnt
want any somber songs about car
wrecks

DAVE
But that was a great song

Nobody thought so then I remember

when he tried it out in Boston

Standing behind them is ANNIE who holds a clip board

and pencil

JAKE
(firmly)
Were doing Wreck on the Highway

SHEP
I said wed put it on the next

song

JAKE
Play it

JAKE walks back to the microphone
JAKE

The next song is something a
little different
c

CONTD
The crowd cheers

JAKE
Hope you like it

The crowd applauds JAKE surveys their eager faces
moving his head slowly from side to side as if he were
adjusting some unknown tightness in his neck He looks
over his right shoulder at SHEP He waits The audi-
torium goes silent -- waiting for SHEP to cue the band
Finally SHEP shaking his head nods to the drummer

and the band begins the slow sorrowful intro into Wreck
on the Highway JAKE turns back to the mike takes it
in both his hands and moves up close HE begins to sing

JAKE
(singing)
Last night I was out driving
Coming home at the end of a working day
I was riding alone through the drizzling rain
On a deserted stretch of a country two lane
When I came upon a wreck on the highway

The crowd remains respectfully attentive They have never
heard a song like this before especially from JAKE
DeNARDO But before they react they listen with grow-
ing apprehension that the erotic prankster may be setting
them up for a fall

JAKE
(singing)
There was blood and glass all over
And there was nobody there but me
As the rain tumbled down hard and cold
I seen a young man lying by the side of the road
He cried mister wont you help me please

The crowd begins to get restless Wheres the animal
like shrieks the erotic hip moves the possessed dancing
-- wheres their JAKE DeNARDO

JAKE
(singing)
An ambulance finally came and took him to Riverside
I watched as they drove him away
and I thought of a girlfriend or a young wife
and a state trooper knocking in the middle of the night
to say your baby died in a wreck on the highway

The crowd is starting to get angry There are scattered
boos and screamed out requests for JAKEs old hits But
JAKE is unmoved - hes determined to finish the song

CONTD

JAKE
(singing)

Sometimes I sit up in the darkness
And I watch my baby as she sleeps
Then I climb in bed and I hold her tight
I just lay there awake in the middle of the night
Thinking ‘bout the wreck on the highway

( ¢1980 Bruce Springsteen)

The song fades out the bass and piano and guitar ticking
the beats away like time -- too precious to squander --
ticking off a clock without hope of ever being returned

The crowd is completely uninterested in JAKEs new song
They came to see unbounded wildness and hes feeding
them somber philosophy They start to stamp their feet
and cry out for the old JAKE JAKE turns his back on
them and walks off the stage PAUL BRUCE and ANNIE
trail behind him Entering the wings JAKE abruptly
stops and turns PAUL almost bangs into him with his
camera JAKE waves him off staring at the ground to
cover the pain in his face

PAUL
Im sorry man well get some
cuteaways of the crowd

PAUL and BRUCE go back on stage and Start filming the
audience leaving ANNIE alone with JAKE BRUCE carries
a portable sun gun and turns it on The light from it
illuminates the surly crowd who stamp their feet crying
out for JAKEs return ANNIE stares at JAKE She has
tears in her eyes

ANNIE
Its a beautiful song Jake

JAKE looks up into her eyes and knows shes right but
the incessant chanting of the crowd drowns out his belief
in his song and himself They want Dionysus -- not some
turnpike poet So be it JAKEs despair hardens into
anger He pushes ANNIE aside and strides back on stage
He walks right up to SHEP who does little to conceal

his pleasure at JAKEs failure

JAKE
(in a savage whisper) ©
Fasten your seat belt -- this
plane is going down

The lights dim and the stage is plunged into absolute
blackness A roar of anticipation rails across the

CONTD

audience The sound swells and expands a full range of
voices screaming yelling whistling and shouting This
is accompanied by thunderous clapping and booming foot-
stomping The din is so loud that SHEP can hardly hear
the opening drum beats The audience now louder than
the band forces SHEP to rely on his intuition as to
when to slide his guitar into the song

JAKE waits letting the band vamp until the crowds long
pent-up hysteria peaks At the exact second the
audiences howl can get no louder JAKE screams with the
full volume of 24000 watts of amplification He screams
as only a person with complete abandonment can He
screams as though a demon presence had taken control of
his vocal chords and stretched them beyond human
limitations

The audience is shocked Theyve never heard such a
sound Their roar is aborted to a gasp At that moment
the stage lights come up and JAKE sings

JAKE

(singing)
You know the wrong destroys the right
The black destroys the light
Come to me
Break on free
Let me give you all my charns
Let me give you all my charms
Yeah

JAKE grabs the mike off its stand and strides up to the
edge of the stage The crowd surges forward to meet
him The police lock arms forming a perimeter across
the apron of the stage

JAKE closes his eyes and keeps chanting

JAKE
(singing)
Come to me
Break on free

The kids charge the polica line and a riot breaks out
JAKE keeps chanting and the kids keep coming The cops
take out their clubs and start beating the kids back
But JAKE xeeps exhorting them

JAKE
(singing)
Come to me
Break on free
(MORE)

JAKE
cmon
Cmon now

All hell breaks out -- cops bashing their clubs against
the kids’ heads girls screaming individual fights
break out PAUL and BRUCE wade into the mayhem getting
it all on film JAKE is oblivious to it all -- eyes
still closed he begins a spastic dance as though the
demon had now surged down through his body and possessed
his legs He teeters on the edge of the stage ready to
fall into the chaos hes created

JAKE
singing)
This music is your lying friend
Dance with me as it intends
Keep on moving until the end
Let the music be what you pretend

JAKE shrieks and falls to the stage floor shrieking
squirming writhing in a spasmodic fit of madness

more and more from the bottle Finally ANNIE takes it
away from him and starts drinking herself just to keep
JAKE from finishing it

PAUL
Isnt this great Ive never
seen a crowd like this before
Theyre crazed -- out of their

Spouts on with feverish
excitement)

how to sing what to say -- said

PAUL

(pointing to the crazed
kids on the moviola screen)
Youre great Do you think some
fucking carbon copy would do that

JAKE

He takes the bottle from ANNIE and finishes it

INT UNION LEAGUE DINING ROOM

Very formal Very stuffy JAKE slouches in his chair
Next to him is a large silver wine cooler A formally
attired elderly white haired waiter finishes filling
JAKEs glass and returns the near empty wine bottle

to the cooler JAKE is dressed in a loose fitting
white shirt and jacket borrowed from Paul A red and
black striped tie is pulled tightly around his neck
ANNIES PARENTS are dignified patricians ANNIEs
father MR KENDEL is a successful Wall Street broker
- firm in his belief in America -- love it or leave it

MR KENDEL
So youre involved in music
Mr DeNardo

JAKE
Yeah music

MR KENDEL
How does that business work
exactly

JAKE
Ah -- I sing -- and ah -- its
recorded -- and ah -- let me see
-- oh yeah and the record
company sells them

MR KENDEL
Are you a gross recipient

JAKE
Ah I dont know -- whats a
gross recipient

CONTD

MR KENDEL
You get a certain percentage of
every record sold

JAKE
Oh well my manager takes care
of that

MR KENDEL
Does he manage your investments

JAKE
I dont know -- he just gives
me living money

MR KENDEL
Its something you should look
into Mr DeNardo Money shouldnt
be handled carelessly

JAKE
I never thought about it much --
money makes me nervous

MR KENDEL
Its nothing to be nervous about
Its the backbone of this country

JAKE
Money

MR KENDEL
Of course - it makes us strong
and free

JAKE
Oh I thought it was for buying
things

MR KENDEL
Yes it is It also allows us
to stand firm and lead the free
world in the struggle against
decadent ideologies

JAKE -
Is that like chaos excess and
uninhibited ecstasy

MR KENDEL
(stern)
That sounds very decadent

CONTD

JAKE
How come people pay a lot of
money for me to be those things

MR KENDEL
Theyre misguided

PAUL
Oh cmon gir You cant say
Rock and Roll is misguided

MR KENDEL
It will pass -- like a bad cold

- JAKE
I’m a bad cold

ANNIE
Oh dad youre so old-fashioned

MR KENDEL
Morality order and knowledge
of the difference between good
and evil is hardly old-fashioned

PAOL
What about change revolution
new ideas -- is that bad

A heated argument between the generations ensues JAKE
watches it for a while but the pain coming from his
bursting bladder focuses his attention on some means
of relief He first attempts to raise himself up out
of his chair but quickly realizes hes too drunk to
stand He looks around and catches sight of the near
empty wine bottle lying in the ice filled cooler next

to him He reaches over for it picks it up and
silentiy slips the bottle under the table With the
other hand he unzips his fly and pees into the wine
bottle under the table MR KENDEL PAUL and ANNIE
argue on completely missing the sound of the bottle
being filled When JAKEs finished he raises the now
full wine bottle from under the table and is about to
return it to the cooler when MR KENDEL catches sight
° t

MR KENDEL
I think Ill have a little more
myself

Before JAKE can do anything the grey-haired waiter

CONTD

emerges from nowhere seizes the bottle out of JAKEs
hand circles the table and fills MR KENDELs glass

MR KENDEL
(raising his wine glass)
Theres nothing like a spirited
debate to dry a mans tongue

He proceeds to take a healthy swig then suddenly
gags spraying a mouthful of piss across the table

JAKE
The cops made the riot If they
werent there nobody would have
tried to get on stage Because
what are they going to de when
they get there Nothing The
only reason they charge the stage
is because theres a barrier If
there werent a barrier theres

DAVE AND SHEP

They talk as they walk through Central Park

DAVE
She said she wasnt at Atlanta

SHEP
(laughing)
Shes lying

CcOoNTD

DAVE
Why

SHEP
If you saw your girl screwing
another guy would you tell
everybody

DAVE
If I were watching with 50000
other people I wouldnt see the
point of lying about it

SHEP
But Jake wasnt those 50000
other peoples lover Theyre
not humiliated They think its
great

DAVE
Why was she there I mean if
they were broken up and she didnt
want to see him anymore what was
she doing there

SHEP
She was with Paul He shot the
show as part of his documentary
It was perfect A perfect
contrast between environmental
theatre and the Rock But in
Dionysus we Ware really doing
it and Jake was faking it --
his belly fucking the mike and
antic pratfalls werent cutting
it anymore -- he wasnt a showman
anymore -- he was just a show-off
And he was tiring of the audience
hating them for being so easily
seduced so he played the erotic
freak Just the right mix of
mythic bullshit and sexual tease

DAVE
But didnt you create Jakes act

SHEP
Thats right And thats all it
was -- just an act Jake began
to think it was real He thought
Dionysus was real too -- thats
what fucked him up
CONTD

DAVE
What was Dionysus

SHEP
I was always an actor You think
you play guitar any better when
youre jumping around You dont
But it sure looks good You see
I never got confused and thought
I was the part-I was playing
But that crucial distinction
completely eluded Jake

DAVE
I understand but what was Dionysus

SHEP
When I was at school at NYU
I joined this environmental
theatre group and our first play
was Dionysus based on Euripides
The Bacchae It was perfect for
us -- the classical confrontation
between ecstasy and order Thats
where I got the idea for the band
and when I saw Jake do his Mick
Jagger I knew I had my Dionysus
So I quit the group and started
Fire But when Jake started going
crazy on stage I gave up and went
back to being an actor

DAVE
Annie said you quit because Jake
wanted to write his own songs

SHEP
(laughs)
You mean his car wreck song

DAVE
Yeah

SHEP
That was all part of his madness
- he thought because he sang the
songs they were his and since
his fans cheered if he fucking
farted on stage -- he thought he
could sing them anything -- so

che sees a car wreck and has dumb

SHEP
assed revelations about death
(with mock hippy jargon)
Hey man -- Déaths a heavy trip
(shaking his head)
So he writes this bird-brained
song and wants to sing it on stage

DAVE
I liked the song

SHEP
It was a piece of shit But he
goes ahead and does it anyway --
and it bombs He cant believe
it -- the great god Jake has bombed
So he takes it out on the audience
and starts a riot Thats when
I checked out

DAVE
What happened when Jake saw Dionysus

SHEP
He saw the real thing and it
freaked him out

DAVE
What do you mean

SHEP
In Dionysus there are many sections
of the play where the audience is
asked to participate like when
Dionysus is born he invites every-
body in the audience to celebrate

FLASHBACK
70 THE PERFORMANCE GARAGE - NIGHT

A huge open space Four 5-tiered towers made of raw
two-by-fours surround the playing area The audience
either sits on one of the many levels of the towers or
crosslegged on the floor forming a circle around the
playing area The nine group members half boys
half girls form an inner circle The boys wear
cut-off briefs the girls skimpy short tunics and
black bikini underpants In the center is Dionysus

He wears nothing but a black jock strap JAKE and BILLY
sit on the third tier of one of the towers BILLY is

CONTD

short dark warm and easy going He covers his total
devotion to JAKE with a no nonsense hard assed veneer

DIONYSUS
I am Dionysus I have come here
tonight to announce my divinity
I am a god

There are some snickers from the audience

DIONYSUS
Some of you find that funny

More snickers

DIONYSUS

Well you unbelievers are going
to have a very unpleasant evening

(the lights start

to dim)
But those of you who do believe
in me can join us in what we do
next Its a birthday party a
celebration a ritual an ordeal
and if you really get into it --
an ecstasy

DIONYSUS starts to dance in the center of the circle
One by one the other group members join him as though
theyre caught up in his erotic spell Others get
instruments -- a flute tambourines temple bells conga
drums -- and begin to play them creating a savage
throbbing music Members of the audience start to join
the actors until the garage is transformed into a
primitive discotheque The group members take off their
clothes and the audience follows their lead Secon the
room is vibrating with hot naked bodies moving erotic-
ally obsessively madly to the beat of the drum JAKE
watches from his tower above Hes never seen anything
like this before The mood in the room is ecstatic chaos
-- yet theres nothing violent about it Everybodys
having a great time

Into the midst of the bacchanal comes SHEP He has an
angry stern look on his face He moves amongst the
revelers embracing them one by one stilling their mad
dancing Once the group members have been touched by
SHEP they drop out of the dance -- as though hes

brought them back to their senses They dress and form

a circle again The audience members realizing theyre
dancing by themselves suddenly become self-conscious and

CONTD

one by one stop dancing They pull on their clothes
and return to their seats Order has been restored in
the room SHEP climbs one of the high towers and speaks»
through a bullhorn At the sound of his amplified
voice all the stage and house lights come up full

SHEP as PENTHEUS
If I allow disorder in my house
Id surely have to license it
abroad A man who deals fairly
with his own he can embrace
justice in the state But he
who breaks the law shall never
have a word of praise from me
The man the state has put in
place must have obedient hearing
to his least command when it is
right and when it is not There
is no greater wrong than dis-
obedience

The Prosecuting Attorney SOMNER FARTH is questioning

shiny baby face He tries to conceal a middle age
paunch under a light grey three piece polyester suit

A SERIES OF SHOTS

illustrate PAULs narrative ending with the appearance
of BETSY BRIM in the witness box

PAUL (VO)
The prosecution paraded one
witness after another that all
testified they saw Jake screw
the girl whose named was Betsy
Brim He would have called the
whole audience if the judge
hadnt stopped him “Is that
your case Mr Farth the judge
asked him Yes said Farth
-- Fine I think 23 eyewitnesses‘
testimony is enough Lets hear
what the defense has to say
So Jakes attorney Sam Kern
tells the judge hes not going
to bore him to death with 23
eyewitnesses who saw that Jake
wasnt making love te Betsy Brim
Because a simulated sex act and
an actual sex act should look
exactly the same to the audience
watching it The whole idea of
acting is that its Supposed to
lock real right So hes going
to cut through the opinions of
whether Jake was putting on a
good show or not and called Betsy
Brim to the stand

panicked and spilled out every-
