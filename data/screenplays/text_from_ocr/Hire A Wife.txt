seemed like a good fit

CLARE
Being a wife

WILL
My ex-wife was promoted to senior
management and made partner at
Semantec while we were married

CLARE
So your job experience for this wife
position is that you were a husband

WILL
A very domestic husband
CLARE
Aha (beat) I don’t know This seems

really weird

WILL
Pellé told me that you’re overwhelmed
and you see your male colleagues with
wives having an easier time juggling
career advancement and family life

Clare nods affirmatively

WILL (cont’d)
You were recently conditionally
promoted and you’re not certain you
can handle it because you’re a single
mother

Remember Clare in order to get

This requires more than simply
educating the public and building
faith in a carbon trading marketplace
You’ve got to hit them where it hurts
Carbon guilt And renewable energy
creates guilt-free zones “Guilt free
energy consumption”

JACQUES
Why not just call him your assistant

She refills his martini

CLARE
Because “Wife” is a title that covers
anything and everything in career and
personal support needs

JACQUES
Isn’t that sexist

CLARE
No

JACQUES

You’re demeaning the role of a wife to
support staff

CLARE
I never thought of it that way I
wonder what my mom would say

JACQUES
Is this some crazy American woman
jealousy tactic

CLARE
God - No

JACQUES
Then what is it

CLARE
I hired a wife That’s it

JACQUES
First of all no one HIRES a wife --
they marry one Secondly she’s --
he’s -- a MAN Clare

CLARE
This is really nothing to feel
threatened about I just need HELP
That’s it I can’t seem to buy
groceries do my laundry take care of
Justin and progress my career all at
the same time

Jacques
Youre crazy You know that

CLARE
Look if you have a problem with the
word “wife” just call him my “helper”

JACQUES
Helper Oh please

CLARE
It doesn’t matter what we call him
Call him my “gwaabeelagok”

JACQUES
Has your “gwaabeelagok” met Justin

CLARE
Of course My “gwaabeelagok” picks
him up every day from school

JACQUES
Well when do I get to meet Justin

CLARE
When I’m ready
JACQUES
When is that going to be We’ve been
sneaking around for a year and a half
I’m sick of hiding

We’re predicting that the conversion

kitchen holding a tray with grilled salmon

PGandE EXECUTIVE (contd)
- in more sectors than originally
measured

Will serves the salmon None of the guests notice him

PGandE EXECUTIVE (contd)
- and the time it will take to build
the solar and wind power plants is
still yet to be fully determined We
therefore will focus initial
campaigning on more traditional energy
for now - and we’ll somehow have to
give it a “green twist” - if possible

Will looks up in disbelief

WILL
(blurts out)
If not now when

PGandE EXECUTIVE
to Will)
Excuse me

WILL

The planet is heating up The surge
in public awareness about renewable
energy is at an all time high Fossil
fuels are nonrenewable they draw on
finite resources that will eventually
dwindle becoming too expensive or too
environmentally damaging to retrieve
In contrast renewable energy

Clare signals for Will to stop talking
WILL (cont’d)
resources-such as wind and solar
energy-are constantly replenished and
will never run out

Will stops The guests are quiet for a moment

points

CLARE
Well that was challenging

JACQUES
How can you say that

CLARE
Hello Domestic consumer gluttony

JACQUES
Weren’t you the one who encouraged
them to register in the first place

CLARE
I changed my mind

JACQUES
I thought it was fun and they got some
excellent kitchen necessities

CLARE

I felt claustrophobic all night
JACQUES

Clare --
CLARE

Some women are born wives Some have
to work at it And some never will
be Maybe that’s me

JACQUES
Why are you so afraid of marriage

CLARE
I’m just not the domestic type

JACQUES
It’s more than that

CLARE
Okay I’m afraid if I got married I
would lose my own hard earned life and
take on someone else’s

JACQUES
Since according to you I’m just a
truffle recipe I wouldn’t want to
lose my own hard earned life either

CLARE
What’s that supposed to mean

JACQUES
My dark chocolate truffles are the
only thing your friends know about me

CLARE
You try describing a pastry chef who
calls himself Jacques (she says it
with an over the top French accent)
even though his real name is Jack and
he’s from Montana

JACQUES
How about “he’s a great guy and I
love him” (beat) And for the record

I was born in Provence My whole
family is French

CLARE
Whatever

JACQUES
I’m just your late night booty-call
fuck-bunny and that’s all Ill ever be
to you

CLARE
That is not true

JACQUES
You are absolutely terrified by the
idea of any form of commitment let
alone marriage

CLARE
It’s a choice not a fear

JACQUES
How much more childhood wounding from
a bitter divorcee mother who remarried
four times do you have to recover
from

CLARE
Don’t bring my mother into this

JACQUES
I’m through trying to be your prince
charming Clare Because you don’t
want prince charming What you really
want is a CAREER and definitely not a
husband but a wife Or at the very
least a wifey-husband which I am not

CLARE
Maybe I feel forced to work hard in my
career because I actually make good
money as opposed to YOU who could
(MORE)

CLARE (cont’d)
never support a family living in THIS
city with what you earn

Beat
JACQUES
(quietly)
So that’s it You finally said it
Well don’t worry yourself -- because

it’s over You no longer have a free-
loading underpaid “boyfriend in the
wings” to overcompensate for

He starts to leave

CLARE
Jacques --—

JACQUES
Try stepping down from your privileged
self obsessed pedestal sometime
Clare and pick up a frying pan
Better yet wash one It might do you
some good

He exits in a fury SLAMMING the front door Clare breaks
down crying

Beat
The doorbell RINGS

CLARE

(yelling toward the door)
You know what You’re right JACK I
don’t want to marry you I never
really did I just was buying time
until I got my promotion because I
thought you’d fall apart if I ended it
and I didn’t have the space for a mess
in my life So go make your
goddamned pastries live your life of
fiscal denial and leave me alone

fake concern

WILL
Clare --

CLARE

absolutely NO communication or warning
that you weren’t happy with things

WILL

CLARE
You told me that I’m PRIMA DONNA
DEMANDING SLOB

WILL
I’m sorry I just was trying to say --

CLARE
(quietly)
Forget it You were right

WILL
But I didn’t mean --

CLARE
Jacques basically said the same things
about me that you did And you know
what

She starts crying again

She falls
her

CLARE (cont’d)

Youre both right I’ma shitty
husband I don’t want to be a wife
I’m basically an over ambitious under
supported woman who has not one shred
of domestic tendencies and I’ve become
arrogant and callous with my career
obsessed tunnel vision Worst of all
I have forgotten how to have fun

WILL
Hey come on now You’re getting all
worked up and --

CLARE
Maybe I should take a cooking class or
something

into him He holds her as she weeps consoling

like a wife-boyfriend and take me for

granted

CLARE
I wasn’t that nice of a husband was
I

WILL

Uhhh No actually

CLARE
I‘m sorry

WILL
I’m sorry too that I let it go on so
long

CLARE

Well for what its worth you were a
great wife

WILL
I’ve thought about this a lot
actually And I realized that being
a wife isn’t just a job It’s being
in a relationship and relationships
are between two people not just one
sided A wife should never be just a
dumping ground for to-do lists and
project management

CLARE
I agree

WILL
One of the reasons I didn’t want to be
your wife anymore is because I care
about you and I wanted you to
reciprocate the efforts

CLARE
I’‘1l never treat you like a hired wife
again I promise

WILL
And I won’t ever treat you like one
either

Then he moves clumsily (jumpy house inflated floor) over to
her
