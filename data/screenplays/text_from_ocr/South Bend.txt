EXT VAN NUYS MANSION - EARLY AFTERNOON

An overweight man is seated against the side of a house with
an ugly pink exterior drinking coffee Next to him two men
are watching a small video monitor

Behind them is CLARENCE a tall athletic man with a serious
face He is reading a book and does not look up from it

Across from them JOHNNY a naked man on a lawn chair is
receiving oral sex from TABITHA a blonde surgically
augmented woman They are next to an oval swimming pool

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE “VAN NUYS CALIFORNIA”

Two men with video cameras are recording the sex act while a
boom operator stands nearby The DIRECTOR is also nearby
gloomily watching Tabitha fellate Johnny

JOHNNY
Oh yeah baby Oh yeah That’s
fucking great

DIRECTOR
Don’t talk so much Johnny
(checking his watch)
Um Okay in a minute or so you
should lift her up and turn her
around on the towel into dorsal
(looking around)
Can we get some lube over here

The man who was seated by the house rises for this errand
Clarence continues reading his book undisturbed

INT VAN NUYS MANSION - LIVING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

Clarence leans against a wall inside Tabitha walks by him
nude

TABITHA
I’m done Clarence Just let me get
my clothes and I’1ll be ready to go

CLARENCE
Okay

Tabitha disappears into a room with her make-up kit A moment
later Johnny wearing an undershirt and tight jeans walks
into the living room He notices Clarence considers him
then approaches

JOHNNY
Hey man You work for Louie T and
Abraxus right

CLARENCE
That’s right

JOHNNY
I’m Johnny

Johnny extends his hand Clarence stares down at it After a
moment Johnny laughs

JOHNNY (CONTD)
It’s cool I washed up

Clarence hesitates then reluctantly shakes Johnny’s hand

CLARENCE
Clarence

JOHNNY
Cool to meet you So you’re what
like Tabitha’s bodyguard

CLARENCE
I supervise the talent we
represent keep them out of
trouble

JOHNNY
So you’re not really a bodyguard

CLARENCE
I have a personal protection
license yes

Behind Johnny Tabitha emerges from the room doing a poor
job of removing cocaine from her nostrils Johnny brushes his
hair back still focused on Clarence

JOHNNY
Cool You know I studied Gracie
jujitsu Maybe we could get
together and spar sometime

TABITHA
He’s not gay Johnny
JOHNNY
Oh
(disappointed)
You’re not

Clarence shakes his head Johnny turns to Tabitha

JOHNNY (CONT’D)
I figured because he was the only
other guy here not hypnotized by
your tits but perhaps I’ve just
finally found a straight guy with
some taste

Johnny smiles at Clarence still flirting

TABITHA
I just might not be exactly
Clarence’s type but I know one
thing You’re definitely not his
type so run along now gay-boy We
wrapped early thanks to you so
you can probably get down to West
Hollywood before happy hour

JOHNNY
(turning to exit)
Yeah well you’ve got some white
stuff on your nose lover and for
once it’s not from me

Tabitha rubs the cocaine off her nostrils looks at her
fingertips and then sticks her tongue out at Johnny cattily
She then turns to Clarence her pupils unnaturally small

TABITHA
Listen Clarence what are you
doing tonight

CLARENCE
Why

TABITHA
I’ve got a party gig with Minxx
Some rich kid’s fucking bachelor
thing that Abraxus set up Greg was
supposed to go with us but he’s got
fucking strep throat or some shit

CLARENCE
No way What about Justin He’d go
He’s practically in love with you
TABITHA
Yeah but Justin won’t handle
things if the guys get weird Id
feel a lot better if you were
there Why not

CLARENCE
(flatly)
Because the guys always get weird
It’s your job to make them that
way Besides I’m not your pimp

TABITHA

Well do all the negotiating you
just handle the cash Minxx and I
are getting two grand each plus
any “extras” We’ll give you three
hundred just to stand around and
look well look like you do

(pleading)
Come on

Tabitha presses her breasts into Clarence’s arm looking up
at him with wide eyes He edges away from her grimacing She
sighs in frustration

TABITHA (CONTD)
Alright five hundred Greg was
only going to get three though

CLARENCE
I’1l think about it

TABITHA
Five hundred fucking dollars to
stand around and do nothing while
we work and get fucking pawed at
It’s a man’s world

Tabitha storms off towards the front door With a scowl
Clarence leans down picks up her purse and follows her

INT WESTWOOD MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Clarence sits at a large wooden kitchen table drinking from
a bottle of water and staring off into space

From outside the kitchen the sound of very loud DANCE MUSIC
can be heard In the next room a strobe light is flashing
and the sound of guys HOOTING AND CHEERING is audible over
the music
A very drunk man ROGER staggers into the room dressed
expensively and holding a bottle of champagne in one hand A
sheer stocking hangs limply from his hair

ROGER
Hey man

Clarence looks up at Roger

ROGER (CONTD)

I just got to ask you man
Seriously I mean I’m cool But
seriously How much for a blowjob
from one of the girls

Clarence just looks at Roger

ROGER (CONTD)
I mean shit um-
(with exaggerated
pronunciation)
How much is a “private dance” from
one of the girls Just one of them
But I want like a private dance
you know You know what I mean
right

Clarence continues staring at Roger Just then there is a
female SCREAM from outside the room and the music suddenly
STOPS

MINXX (0S)
What the fuck

Clarence wearily closes his eyes inhaling slowly Roger
looks around in confusion A moment later MINXX a small
Asian woman with fake breasts storms into the room followed
by Tabitha They are both nearly naked

MINXX (CONTD)
He fucking just shoved his fucking
finger in my pussy

Clarence opens his eyes

CLARENCE
Okay Get your things

Tabitha nods Minxx is still yelling enraged
MINXX
Motherfucker didn’t even lick it
first or anything he just jammed
it in like I’m a fucking doorbell
What the fuck

Clarence rises exiting the room The two women follow him

INT WESTWOOD MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Clarence walks out into a room full of sweaty well-dressed
young men The room is opulently furnished the strobe light
still flashing

As Minxx and Tabitha begin hastily gathering up their
clothing MARTIN the party’s host quickly approaches
Clarence holding a wad of cash

MARTIN
Hey look man He’s sorry Look
well pay them extra It’s no big
deal Here

Martin counts out the money in his hands

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Here’s a grand extra to give to
the girls

Both Tabitha and Minxx have stopped what they were doing and
are watching this transaction apparently mollified

Martin turns to a taller man SEBASTIAN who is standing
nearby drinking from a beer bottle and glaring at Clarence

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Youre sorry right man

SEBASTIAN
Fuck no Fuck those two whores

MARTIN
(to Clarence)
Um

SEBASTIAN
Fuck this shit What are you
sucking his dick for There’s like
ten of us What the fuck’s he gonna
do to us

As Sebastian speaks he moves closer to Clarence
SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Yeah so fucking what She was
waving her cooch in my face all
like “look and don’t touch” and I
fucking touched her So fucking
what What the fuck are you gonna
do about it Huh

Sebastian reaches out with his free hand to shove Clarence
Clarence neatly moves to the side grabs Sebastian’s arm and
PUSHES HIS HEAD INTO THE NEAREST WALL putting a dent in the
plaster

Sebastian gives a grunt of pain Several of the other men are
on their feet now

CLARENCE
You don’t touch the girls They can
touch you but you can’t touch
them I believe I explained that to
you at the beginning of the
evening yes

Sebastian does not answer struggling to get away Clarence
holds him tightly

CLARENCE (CONTD)
(to Minxx)
Which hand was it

MINXX
What

CLARENCE
Which hand did he touch you with

MINXX
Um His right one

Clarence reaches down grabs Sebastian’s right thumb and
bends it back with an audible SNAP He then releases
Sebastian who falls to his knees clutching his broken hand

Everyone in the room is staring at this with shock
CLARENCE
Anybody else want to fight Anyone

got a gun maybe

Clarence reaches back into his waistband pulling out a
revolver Everyone stares at it

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Because I do So no Okay then
Clarence tucks the gun back into his waistband and heads
towards the front door

CLARENCE (CONT’D)
Come on

Minxx and Tabitha hurry after Clarence clutching their
clothes in front of them Clarence takes an antibacterial
wipe out of his pocket and begins scrubbing his hands

INT ABRAXUS MANAGEMENT OFFICE - MORNING

LOUIE T an overweight man in his fifties is seated behind
a desk in a sunlit office Clarence is standing in front of
him

LOUIE T
What the fuck is wrong with you

Clarence does not respond

LOUIE T (CONTD)
Are you mentally fucking ill is
that it You go to a fucking
bachelor party one that’s been
arranged through Abraxus and what
the fuck do you do

CLARENCE
Look things got out of hand-

LOUIE T

You broke a groomsman’s thumb and
then waved a gun around Are you
trying to be fucking funny The
reason we hire guys like you - ex-
cons ex-military - is because we
expect that you can handle a room
full of drunken frat boys without
acting like a psychopath

CLARENCE
The guy was an asshole

LOUIE T
You’re a fucking asshole He could
fucking sue us Fortunately he
knows we’d countersue him and his
family out of fucking existence so
that’s not an issue We are going
to pay his medical bills though
and you know where that’s going to
come from Your fucking salary
CLARENCE
Whoa hey you can’t-

LOUIE T
You’re going to tell me what I can
and can’t do Huh No I should
fucking fire you but I like the
way you handle actual situations
so I’m just docking your pay two
hundred bucks a week until that
shit’s paid off But whatevers
fucking wrong with you Clarence
you need to take care of it or I
will fucking have to take care of
you next time You understand

CLARENCE
Yeah I got it

LOUIE T
Good Now I’ve got a job for you
that maybe you can pull off without
fucking killing anyone I need you
to pick a girl up from the airport
today Name’s Katie Jane though we
might be changing that if we can’t
work out a deal with the domain
name I can’t decide Katie Jane

Clarence shrugs

LOUIE T (CONTD)
Laura’s got the flight details for
you out there And Clarence Real
red carpet treatment for this one

Clarence about to exit the room stops

CLARENCE
She special or something

LOUIE T
You better fucking believe it

Kansas one of our scouts found her
on some model thing taped an
interview She was a high school
beauty queen like I mean fucking
literally

(MORE)

LOUIE T (CONTD)

contract mid six figures each one

Clarence whistles

LOUIE T (CONT’D)

Daniels or fucking Jenna Jameson
But don’t take my word for it
Youll fucking know it when you see
her

Clarence nods dismissed and exits the room

EXT BURBANK AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - EARLY AFTERNOON

The baggage claim at the airport is outside the building
Clarence stands near the airport’s exit in a group of people
eagerly waiting for relatives friends and lovers

In this group are also several bored professionally attired
chauffeurs who like Clarence himself are holding signs
bearing the name of their assigned passengers Clarence is
loosely holding a sign that reads in hand-written capital
letters “KATIE JANE”

People begin filing out of the airport hugging their loved
ones and happily wandering away After a moment a blonde
girl comes out of the airport carrying a large backpack

She looks around unsure then her eyes light up when she
sees Clarence’s sign She quickly walks over to him smiling
She is young radiant and beautiful This is KATIE JANE

KATIE JANE

Hi there You’re for me
CLARENCE

Ms Jane
KATIE JANE

Oh no Katie Well Katie Jane

and I don’t use my actual last
name So everyone calls me Katie
Jane or KJ for short You can
call me whatever you want really

CLARENCE
Do you have any other luggage

KATIE JANE
No this is it

Clarence frowns at this

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
They said they’d be giving me some
money to buy a new wardrobe once I
got out here so I figured I should
pack light It’s part of my
contract and all I get a budget
just to buy clothes

CLARENCE
Well then may I carry your bag for
you

KATIE JANE

Oh no It’s fine just clothes and
books and stuff Where’s your car

Clarence shuts the door then climbs into the front seat He
starts the engine and puts the car into reverse

KATIE JANE (CONT’D)
Wait Hold on a second

Clarence hits the brakes Katie Jane gets out of the car
then climbs into the passenger seat next to Clarence

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
There I feel weird sitting in the
backseat talking at the back of
your head Seems rude and all

CLARENCE
It’s fine That’s how it works

KATIE JANE
Well I’m more comfortable sitting
up here If you don’t mind

CLARENCE
No Whatever you’d prefer

Clarence backs the car out of its space and heads for the
garage’s exit

EXT ABRAXUS MANAGEMENT OFFICE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

grade VIDEO CAMERA The car is parked in front of a fairly
nice office building in the Canoga Park area

Clarence is aiming the video camera across the street where
several birds are perched on electric lines dark against the
blue sky He watches them through the camera’s view screen

Katie Jane exits through the front door of the building
holding two padded envelopes She crosses over to the car
Cc

di

larence quickly ducks in front of her opening the passenger
oor

KATIE JANE
Well aren’t you the gentleman

side

INT CADILLAC - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER

Clarence navigates the car through traffic Katie Jane in
the passenger seat watches him closely

CLARENCE
Your apartment’s in North
Hollywood right on the Studio City
border People there might call it
West Toluca Lake just because
North Hollywoods got a lousy
reputation but it’s really not so
bad an area

KATIE JANE
I’m sure it’ll be fine

They drive in silence for a moment

CLARENCE
You’ve got the key

Katie Jane shakes one of the envelopes in her hand

KATIE JANE
Say you want to grab something to
eat before you drop me off It’s on
me

Katie Jane holds up the second envelope

KATIE JANE (CONT’D)
Believe me I can afford it

CLARENCE
I’m not hungry thanks But uh
you signed on with Abraxus then

KATIE JANE

Mm-hmm I’d be crazy not to

(sighs )
You know ever since I can
remember I always wanted to be a
real movie star just like Grace
Kelly in those old movies I wanted
to see myself on TV my face up
on billboards in cities I’d never
been to If this is the closest I
can get to that well that’s not
so bad

Clarence drives in silence obviously not sure what to say

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
So what about you
(appraising)
Louie T talks about you like you’re
some real tough guy a real
bruiser

CLARENCE
He does huh

KATIE JANE
Mmm-hmm So how’d you get into
this line of work

CLARENCE
Well Awhile ago I got into a
situation where my best option was
to go into the armed forces
(MORE)

CLARENCE (CONTD)

after I got back from the Middle

bouncer at this strip club and one
night Rico- That’s Louie T’s
brother you meet him

apartment building Katie Jane sits in the passenger seat
looking out the window at it

CLARENCE

reach someone right

KATIE JANE
Yeah I’m fine It’s just- Say why
don’t you come inside and check out
my new place with me It might be
weird being here my first night in
the city all by myself

Clarence appears to consider his response before speaking

CLARENCE
I don’t think that would be such a
good idea

KATIE JANE

anything But alright

Katie Jane climbs out of the car

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
I guess Ill see you later

Katie Jane shuts the door Clarence watches her walk up into

Excuse me ma’am we’re trying to
find a Mr Jake Andrews Does he
reside hereabouts

CLARENCE
Well we’re trying to find his
daughter actually Katie Jane Do

EDNA
‘Course I know Katie Jane Always
running around here Last I heard
she’d run off to Hollywood to
become a big movie star

The last few words are dripping in sarcasm

CLARENCE
Well this is sort of about that
Do you know if she’s still out
there in California or if she
might have moved back home

EDNA
Well now how in the hell would I
know that You ought to be asking
Jake He was out for a bit but
he’s back now He’s up there in his
trailer

CLARENCE
(grits his teeth)
Which one is that

EDNA
Right behind you

inside

INT JAKE ANDREWS TRAILER - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

The interior of the trailer is dimly lit the blinds on all
of the windows drawn In the corner of the kitchen JAKE
ANDREWS a husky man in his mid-fifties is seated at a
linoleum table watching television and drinking bourbon from
a plastic cup He has a half-empty bottle in front of him
surrounded by empty cans of beer

As soon as Jake sees Clarence and Justin he rises to his
feet with alarm staggering just slightly as he does so

JAKE ANDREWS
Whoa hey Jonah said we were
straight I done settled up with
yall

JUSTIN
What

JAKE ANDREWS
(confused)
Well wait Who are you

CLARENCE
Were from Abraxus Entertainment in
Los Angeles Mr Andrews Your
daughter Katie Jane signed a
contract with us and then
disappeared We were hoping to
locate her and speak with her
before taking any sort of legal
action Just to make sure she’s
alright if nothing else

A cagey look comes over Jake’s face as he sits back down

JAKE ANDREWS
Well I’m sorry about the confusion
there I’ve had some business
troubles as of late nothing major
though

CLARENCE
I’m relieved to hear that

JAKE ANDREWS
Can I offer either of you two
gentlemen a drink

CLARENCE
No thank you

JAKE ANDREWS
You mind-

CLARENCE
Help yourself

Jake pours himself a shot of bourbon and drinks it quickly
His fingers tremble slightly as he sets the cup back on the
table then fills it again with a slightly steadier hand

JAKE ANDREWS
That’s better Now you all said
you’re looking for Katie Jane

CLARENCE
That’s correct

JAKE ANDREWS
Now that can’t be right because I
believe she’s out in Los Angeles
right now Said she had her own
place out there and everything
(MORE)

JAKE ANDREWS (CONTD)
Signed with some sort of smaller
studio some of kind adult
entertainment thing with a funny
name Ab-something

Abraxus We just told you that
That’s where we’re from

there with you

CLARENCE
No sir She isn’t

JAKE ANDREWS
Well that has me worried Because
last I heard that’s where she was
Are you all telling me that you
lost her

Clarence and Justin both are staring hard at Jake who looks
back at them innocently Clarence looks around the filthy
trailer Jake has clearly been the only resident for awhile

CLARENCE
So you don’t know where she is
then

JAKE ANDREWS
Far as I know still in Los
Angeles

CLARENCE
Does she have any other relatives
or friends in the area who she
might be staying with

JAKE ANDREWS

Well sure Katie Jane’s always had
plenty of friends You might want
to look up her brothers first
She’d go to them if she was ina
pinch probably before her old man

(laughs somewhat harshly)
Can’t say as how I’d blame her

CLARENCE
Her brothers live here in town

JAKE ANDREWS
Just outside actually Farther
than this anyway but it’s real
easy to find They all live ina
big ol’ house together Here I’1l
write down the address for you

Jake scrawls down an address on a torn bill fragment which
he hands to Clarence Clarence takes it carefully by one
corner

JAKE ANDREWS (CONT’D)
You just go by there tell them
what you told me I’m sure they’1ll
let you know if they know anything

CLARENCE
Alright then Thank you

JUSTIN

We should go back in there and beat
it out of him

CLARENCE
Beat what out of him

JUSTIN
Whatever he knows Give me five
minutes with him I’1ll have him
talking

CLARENCE
Probably not the best way to get
Katie Jane to come back with us we
show up and put her father in the
hospital No let’s head back into
town and get hotel rooms I need to
shower Then we go out and see
these brothers of hers

JUSTIN
And what if they won’t tell us
anything

CLARENCE

I guess we can hope they’re even
worse liars than their dad

They reach the truck and climb inside

JUSTIN
This entire place makes me wish we
couldve brought guns Even the air
here feels wrong

CLARENCE
It’s just the humidity

Justin starts the truck and they pull away

INT HOTEL OFFICE - AFTERNOON - A HALF HOUR LATER

Clarence and Justin stand at the counter of the front office
of a small hotel

On the other side of the counter an elderly woman AGATHA
the hotel’s proprietor fishes a metal key with a plastic tag
off a hook and hands it to Clarence

AGATHA
There you go Room twelve I’d say
it’s the best but it’s just the
same as all the others

CLARENCE
That’s fine We’ll let you know if
we need to extend our stay

AGATHA
Well you can take your time on
that We ain’t exactly booked up
for the tourist season

Clarence nods and exits the office with Justin

INT HOTEL - ROOM TWELVE - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER

The hotel room has two full-size beds Clarence packs his
video camera into his duffel bag on one of the beds while
Justin stands and flips through the channels on the room’s
television set with a remote

JUSTIN
No pay channels Not even Showtime

CLARENCE
It’s not so bad Clean enough No
mildew in the shower

Justin gives Clarence a look

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Come on get unpacked so we can get
going

EXT METH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Clarence and Justin wearing different clothes and looking
more composed walk up a dirt path through an unkempt lawn

They reach the porch to a dilapidated house with boards on
the windows and paint peeling There are no other houses
nearby As they climb the stairs to the porch skinhead PUNK
ROCK MUSIC is just audible coming from within

JUSTIN
Shit if I couldn’t hear that Id
assume this place has been
abandoned for years

CLARENCE
Keep your eyes open here

JUSTIN
Youre kidding right One of these
hillbillies starts shit with me
I’1l knock his brains loose in his
skull

Clarence nods and reaching the door knocks
Immediately the sound of SCRAMBLING and SHOUTING comes from
within Something heavy is pushed up against the other side

of the door Then a voice comes

CREEK (0S)
Who the fuck is it

Clarence addresses the door
CLARENCE

Were looking for Katie Jane We
were told she might be here

CREEK (0OS)
You cops

CLARENCE
No

CREEK (0OS)

Say it Say you ain’t cops

CLARENCE
We are not police officers

From inside there is a frantic conversation

SKEETER (0S)
You hear how he said that It’s the
ATF Ask ‘im if he’s ATF

CREEK (0S)
You ATF Answer me

JESSE (0S)
Shut the goddamn fuck up and get
that shit away from the fucking
door Creek You just heard the man
say he’s looking for Katie Jane
Open the door and let’s hear
exactly why he’s goddamn lookin’
for her

There is silence then the sound of something being moved
away from the door The door opens a crack through which
CREEK Katie Jane’s second youngest brother a 19-year-old
tweaker sticks his mottled face Beneath that he is holding
a REVOLVER loosely aimed at Clarence’s abdomen

Clarence politely holds his hands out to the sides Creek
looks from him to Justin then back again

CREEK
Well alright You come on in

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

Clarence and Justin walk inside the meth house Creek
immediately shuts the door behind them

The windows to the house are boarded up and booby-trapped
with meth-addled defense rigs cannisters of AMMONIUM SULFATE
aimed at the door and a SHOTGUN filled with RUSTY NAILS and
SYRINGES pointed at one of the windows a string running from
its trigger to the window sash

Above the door an open BEAR TRAP has been nailed to a wooden
board on a hinge which is attached a string that hangs down
limply Both Clarence and Justin move to avoid standing under
this

JESSE
That ain’t set

JESSE Katie Jane’s eldest brother is seated on the sofa
drinking a beer He watches Clarence taking in the traps

JESSE (CONTD)
Anyone busts in on our stash
they’1l sure as fuck regret it
quick

SKEETER older than Creek but younger than Jesse is seated
on a chair wearing a desert camouflage jacket and holding a
cigarette that has almost burned down to his fingers He
stares at Clarence and Justin as if they had just emerged
directly from a nightmare

SKEETER
Jesse but now we got to change all
the traps ‘cause he’s seen ‘em

JESSE
Shut the hell up Skeeter That man
look like he’s here to score some
Billy Whizz
(to Clarence facetious)
How ‘bout it mister Best cristy
in four counties

Creek laughs as if Jesse has just made a brilliant joke

CREEK
Only in four counties

JESSE
Five

Creek stops laughing chastened and confused Clarence looks
into the next room to see that the kitchen has been rigged up
as a FULL METH LAB A very THIN WOMAN wearing only
underwear is curled up on the linoleum floor asleep

CLARENCE
(to Jesse)
Would you mind opening a window

JESSE
(laughing)
You want to try opening a window
go right ahead I recommend that
one there It’1l only maim you

Jesse gestures towards a window with a large spring-loaded
RUSTY SAW BLADE positioned above it Clarence scowls

CLARENCE
Never mind

JESSE

‘Sides the fumes ain’t a problem
I’ve been breathing ‘em in for
years and I’m about as sharp as
I’ve ever been no foolin’ Which
brings me to you mister- Hang up

(shouting)
Cooter get the fuck in here
Cooter

A moment later a small teenager COOTER comes into the room
with a PIT BULL on a lease The pit bull immediately begins
BARKING and LUNGING at Justin who takes a step back but the
boy holds the lease tightly staring mutely at the floor

JESSE (CONTD)
That’s Champ there on the rope He
ain’t never liked him no nigroes
Ain’t no fault of ours we didn’t
bring him up that way I swear but
a nigra must’ve done something bad
to him when he was just a pup
That’s my guess anyways Anyway
it ain’t nothing personal mister

JUSTIN
(muttering)
I’1l keep that in mind

JESSE

Okay so family conference We got
Cooter there with the dog Creek
with the gun Skeeter’s by my side
and I’m Jesse Katie Jane’s our
sister Now who might you be

CLARENCE
My name is Clarence This is
Justin

JESSE
Mmm-hmm alright Clarence and
Justin I think I can keep that
straight Now what business might
you all have with our sister

Champ lunges at the end of his rope again BARKING FURIOUSLY
at Justin Cooter continues holding the rope with both hands
his skinny torso straining against the dog’s strength still
just looking morosely at the floor

Clarence looks from Cooter to Justin who just stares back at
him Clarence turns back to Jesse

CLARENCE
I uh Well We work for a
management company called Abraxus
Entertainment Your sister Katie
is contracted to our company as an
actress but she recently went
missing and we’ve been trying to
locate her Just to make sure
nothing’s happened to her

JESSE
“Just to make sure nothing’s
happened to her”

Creek still idly aiming the gun at Clarence laughs meanly

CLARENCE
That’s right

JESSE
I gotta say I ain’t had a whole
lot to laugh at since John Candy
died but this here strikes me as
funny Let me tell you this tale
from my perspective and see if it
don’t strike you as funny too

Jesse pulls a knife out from one of his boots and begins
gesturing with it as he speaks

JESSE (CONTD)
A few days ago our lovely
beautiful sister goes missing We
find out from our dear pa that
she’s run off and signed a contract
with a company that’s going to put
her in the movies Except of
course there’s a twist

(MORE )

JESSE (CONTD)
Their talking about putting her in
porno movies the kind where she
takes a nigra’s dick in her ass
while a bunch of sad-sack guys line
up to shoot their fuckin’ jizz on
her S’called boo- What do they
call that

The cigarette between Skeeter’s fingers burns down to his
flesh and goes out with an audible HISS the skin smoldering
He does not appear to notice his eyes on Clarence

SKEETER
Boo-kah-kay

JESSE
That’s right Bukkake And she’s
been tricked into a signing a
contract with these motherfuckers
who are keeping her locked up in an
apartment until she’s ready to be
filmed gettin’ her back cherry
popped Big bucks for that I
guess So our pa says he’s sending
some fellas buddies of his who
don’t mind flying to rescue her
and bring her back and that’s what
they did Ain’t that right
Skeeter

SKEETER
Yes it is

JESSE

And then when she’s finally back
here our daddy explains to us that
it still ain’t over that we got to
hide her because that rich fucking
company is probably going to send
people after her to get her back
So he finds a safe place for her to
stay and tells us to be on the
lookout for anyone from- What was
the name of that company again

SKEETER
Abraxus Entertainment LLC

JESSE
That’s right Now where’d you boys
say you were from again

There is a moment of silence

CLARENCE
I think there’s been a
misunderstanding You said your
father Jake Andrews-

JESSE
(interrupting)
Clean ‘em up

Cooter immediately RELEASES CHAMP who leaps past Clarence
and BITES DOWN onto Justin’s arm taking him to the ground

As Creek raises his gun to aim it at Clarence Clarence spins
into Creek and ELBOWS HIM IN THE HEAD grasping Creek’s gun
arm as he does so

Clarence then yanks the revolver out of Creek’s hand and
smashes the butt of the gun into Creek’s head KNOCKING HIM
OUT

Clarence turns to see Jesse THROWING A KNIFE AT HIM He
twists away just in time as the knife flips past hitting the
wall behind him with its handle and falling uselessly to the
floor

JESSE (CONTD)
Well Didn’t time that right

Clarence looks at Justin who is still beneath Champ
struggling Clarence kicks out with one foot BREAKING THE
DOGS SPINE Champ goes limp DYING with a short HOWL

Justin rises to his feet with a YELL and lifting the dog’s
body smashes it down against the ground in a horrible heap
Justin’s arm is bleeding

JUSTIN
Fuck

Skeeter rises up out of his chair reaching for a pistol ona
table nearby Clarence immediately has the gun aimed at him

CLARENCE
No you don’t

With a horrible WAIL Cooter throws himself at Clarence
kicking and biting

Clarence kicks Cooter ACROSS THE ROOM Cooter immediately
leaps to his feet and charges Clarence again HOWLING

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Justin

Clarence tosses the gun to Justin who catches it and uses it
to cover Jesse and Skeeter Clarence turns just in time to
block Cooter’s second onslaught as he flails furiously at
Clarence with his skinny limbs

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Goddammit

Clarence picks Cooter up and THROWS HIM hard Cooter smashes
against the far wall breaking a dusty framed painting and
hits the ground inert He does not move

Both Clarence and Justin are gasping for breath Skeeter is
frozen in mid-stride staring at the gun in Justin’s hand
with pure venom Jesse is watching the entire scene calmly
almost amused still on the sofa

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Where Where’s Katie Jane

JESSE
(shrugs)
Don’t know Pa said the less folks
know the better

Justin cocks the revolver

JUSTIN
Want me to start working on him

Jesse does not change expression

CLARENCE

No They’re telling the truth
These idiots don’t know anything
They got fed a bunch of lies

(to Jesse)
You talk to Katie Jane you tell
her what she does with her life is
her business and none of mine or
ours But she’s got some money
that’s owed to our people and she
needs to give that back

JESSE
(thoughtful)
Well That’s certainly news to me
but should I find myself in a
position to communicate with her I
will relay the message

Clarence nods He and Justin carefully back out through the
front door

EXT METH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER

As they hurry towards the pick-up truck Justin tucks the
revolver into the waistband of his jeans and examines his
bloody arm

JUSTIN
Fuck I need to go get a rabies
test

CLARENCE

Yes you should Actually though
dog’s mouths are relatively clean
compared to human mouths anyway
Dog’s mouths contain only three
different types of bacteria
whereas the human mouth contains
over a hundred We should get some
iodine and bandages and that’1l
probably be enough for now

JUSTIN
Huh
(pause)
Well fuck it then Let’s get a
drink first

INT PICK-UP TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON - MINUTES LATER

Driving down a winding country road Clarence checks the
rearview mirror Headlights are just barely visible in the
darkness behind them a good distance away

JUSTIN
What They following us

CLARENCE
It’s not them They couldn’t be
after us this fast

As Clarence continues watching the car behind them turns
onto a gravel road and its headlights disappear from view

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Never mind

JUSTIN
Youve got me fucking paranoid
man

EXT GREAT BEND STREET - EARLY EVENING - MINUTES LATER

Clarence drives the truck down a business street back in
town A neon Miller Genuine Draft sign identifies a bar up
ahead The street is otherwise dark and quiet

JUSTIN
There’s a place

Clarence pulls the truck over

INT SMITTY’S BAR - EARLY EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

Clarence and Justin walk inside the bar Justin still holding
his bloody arm

There are only a few patrons inside the bar and they all
stop and stare at Clarence and Justin as they walk inside
Country music blares on the jukebox and a few men are
playing billiards

Clarence and Justin walk and sit down at the otherwise empty
bar The BARTENDER watching a high school football game on a
television ignores them

JUSTIN
Hey

The bartender continues to ignore them

JUSTIN (CONT’D)
Hey Jethro We would like to
exchange money for beverages over
here

The bartender glances over and with exaggerated slowness
walks over to where they are seated

BARTENDER
What’1ll it be

JUSTIN
Give me three shots of Dewar’s
line ‘em up

CLARENCE
Ginger ale

The bartender nods and pours the drinks

BARTENDER
Thatll be eight-fifty

Justin whistles slowly and hands the bartender a twenty

JUSTIN
You just keep that

The bartender looks at the cash nods stiffly and returns his
attention to the television set

As Justin downs his shots Clarence sips his ginger ale and
surveys the bar Everyone is glancing at them occasionally A
group of men who were playing pool have ceased playing and
are openly watching Justin Clarence holds eye contact with
one of the men then turns back to the bar

CLARENCE
I think we should get out of here
before too long

JUSTIN
What and leave this ambience
behind Hang on

Justin finishes his last shot and slams the glass down on the
bar

JUSTIN (CONT’D)
Now I’m ready for you to pour
iodine on me

CLARENCE
Great Let’s go

They rise from their bar stools and exit

EXT SMITTY’S BAR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Justin and Clarence step outside Justin glancing down at his
arm They walk over to their truck Nearby tires SCREECH

JUSTIN
You know it’s stopped-

An SUV abruptly comes to a halt directly in front of them and
Justin’s chest EXPLODES as he is shot multiple times A
figure in the passenger seat is firing an AUTOMATIC RIFLE out
the window

As Justin flies backwards bloody and perforated with
bullets Clarence throws himself down behind the truck
crouching just behind one of its tires

The gunman a thickset younger man named FITZ continues
shooting at the truck

Clarence cringes as bullets riddle the truck flattening its
tires breaking out its windows and punching holes in the
metal but missing him

Finally the automatic rifle clicks empty

FITZ
Shit

There is another squeal of tires and the SUV barrels off down
the street

Clarence leans over grabs the revolver out of Justin’s
waistband and takes off running in the other direction

EXT GREAT BEND SIDE STREET - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

Clarence runs down the sidewalk of an empty street revolver
in hand He can hear the SUV’s tires screeching in the
distance

Clarence ducks down an alley and runs past a couple of
dumpsters He stops behind one of them catching his breath

Looking around Clarence sees a couple of cars in a parking
lot across the street The parking lot adjoins a dark store
and is mostly surrounded by a chain link fence There is no
one around

Clarence heads towards the parking lot

EXT PARKING LOT - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

Clarence kneels by one of the older cars in the lot his lock
kit in hand He inserts a rod into the keyhole on the
driver’s side and begins working it around

CLARENCE
Shit

Clarence frowns concentrating on his work A moment later a
SPOTLIGHT lands on Clarence illuminating the area around
him

Clarence turns around A SHERIFF’S CAR has pulled up near the
edge of the lot SHERIFF CONRAD an overweight man in his
fifties is standing positioned behind the open drivers
door his gun and the car’s spotlight aimed at Clarence

SHERIFF CONRAD
Youd best stop right there

Clarence grimaces and slowly rises to his feet his hands in
the air

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
That’s just fine Now turn around
and put your hands on the vehicle

Clarence complies placing his hands on the roof of the car
The sheriff moves over to him

CLARENCE
Listen-

SHERIFF CONRAD
You wouldn’t happen to be involved
in a shooting that just occurred
would you mister

CLARENCE
I would but we were the ones who
were shot at My friend was killed
We weren’t doing anything

SHERIFF CONRAD
You’1l forgive me if I find that
slightly difficult to believe Two
strangers come into town get
involved in a street shooting and
then the surviving one tries to
steal a car Spread ‘em

Clarence spreads his legs and the sheriff pats him down
immediately finding the revolver in the back of Clarence’s
waistband The sheriff pulls it out and examines it

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)

Hmm

CLARENCE
That I can explain that It’s
not mine

SHERIFF CONRAD
Well there’ll be plenty of time
for explaining things down at the
station

The sheriff removes Clarence’s wallet from his back pocket
then taps one of his jacket pockets with the revolver barrel

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
What’s that

CLARENCE
My cell phone

SHERIFF CONRAD
I’1l see that if you don’t mind
Slowly

Clarence slowly removes the cell phone from his jacket
pocket The sheriff takes it and pockets it

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
Hands behind your back

Clarence puts his hands behind his back and the sheriff
fastens handcuffs around his wrists

INT SHERIFF’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

The sheriff pushes Clarence into the back of the car then
climbs into the driver’s seat They are separated by a metal
grid

The sheriff begins driving

CLARENCE
I need to make a phone call

SHERIFF CONRAD
Hold your horses

As he drives the sheriff begins dialing a number on a cell
phone He speaks into it

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
Hey Jonah it’s me I got your
boy the one that run away I told
you you shouldn’t send those kids
to do a man’s job

The sheriff pauses listening Clarence stares at him

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
(into phone laughing)
Yeah well maybe you’re right
about that No I can just bring
him up there right now It ain’t
like I’ve got anything better to
do Steve and the coroner are
taking care of your mess right now
(pause)
That’s fine

The sheriff hangs up the phone As he steers the car onto a
highway he looks up into the rearview mirror and sees
Clarence looking at him

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
Well Ain’t you got some sort of
clever comment you want to make
city boy

Clarence continues silently watching

EXT JONAH’S MANSION - EVENING - A HALF HOUR LATER

The sheriffs car pulls up in the driveway of an enormous
house in the style of Greek revival plantations The house
is in the middle of nowhere surrounded on all side by
haphazard cornfields the stalks tall and green

The sheriffs climbs out of the front seat of the car opens
the back door and hauls Clarence out by one cuffed arm

SHERIFF CONRAD
Come on out

The sheriff leads Clarence up the stairs to a white painted
porch A porch swing hangs in front of an ornate front
window

The sheriff presses the doorbell A series of CHIMES ring
audibly inside

The sheriff glances up at Clarence as they wait
SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
Well You’ve really become the
strong silent type all of a sudden

Clarence says nothing The sheriff smiles

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
We’ll see how long that lasts

The door opens

INT JONAH’S MANSION - FRONT ROOM - EVENING

The gunman from the street shooting Fitz opens the door
His face is bruised and he is holding a cloth filled with ice
to a bleeding gash on his forehead

The sheriff laughs at the sight of him

SHERIFF CONRAD
Hey Fitz What in tarnation
happened to you You get in a fight
with a bear boy

The sheriff pushes Clarence past Fitz and into the front
room A spiral staircase leads up to the second floor An
enormous GLASS CHANDELIER hangs above them

Fitz’s speech comes out slurred through his swollen mouth

FITZ
Jonah’s waitin’ on y’all in the
sitting room

SHERIFF CONRAD
Well
(gestures )
By all means lead the way

Fitz shoots the sheriff a look and walks through the front
room towards a short hallway The sheriff follows still
leading Clarence by the elbow

INT JONAH’S MANSION - SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Three men are in the sitting room one standing the other
two seated on an antique couches The standing man MICHAEL
is wearing a dark suit and thick eyeglasses Across from him
DERRICK in his late teens is looking nervous and chastened
his head lowered

The other seated man JONAH is rotund and sweating fanning
himself with a magazine as he sips from a brandy cocktail He
looks up and smiles as the three men enter the room

JONAH
Now Who is this

The sheriff takes out Clarence’s wallet and tosses it onto a
coffee table in front of Jonah

SHERIFF CONRAD
License says his name’s Clarence
Fontaine

Jonah lifts up the wallet and flips through it Looking in
the billfold he sees that it is empty

JONAH
Huh Was there any cash in here

SHERIFF CONRAD
Yeah uh a couple hundred bucks in
twenties Why you want it

JONAH
No no you keep it You did good
work tonight Conrad and I’1ll see
to it that you’re rewarded I’ve
got your little extra something
upstairs too if you so desire

SHERIFF CONRAD
(grinning)
Oh I do indeed most definitely
Here’s the keys for his cuffs if
you want ‘em

The sheriffs sets a key down on the coffee table next to
Clarence’s wallet and exits the sitting room leaving
Clarence and Fitz still standing near the doorway

Jonah points to a chair across from him

JONAH
Fitz sit him down

Fitz leads Clarence over to the chair and roughly shoves him
down Clarence glares up at Fitz as he moves away

With his hands cuffed behind his back Clarence sits poised
at the edge of the chair He looks at the key on the table in
front of him

MICHAEL
Uh uh

Clarence looks up and sees that Michael watching him is
shaking his head Reluctantly Clarence settles back in his
seat a bit

JONAH
That’s better You’re from Los
Angeles

Clarence looks around then answers

CLARENCE
Yes

JONAH
I understand you’ve been inquiring
after my property I’1ll tell you
truthfully I don’t take too kindly
to that

CLARENCE
Your property

JONAH
Katie Jane Andrews You all seem to
think she might be yours but she
isn’t She’s mine You see her
father and I came to a business
arrangement I run a few private
gambling establishments in and
around Wichita and one way or
another Mr Andrews who I believe
youve met found himself
substantially in my debt Which is
when he came to me with a
proposition Forgiving his debts in
exchange for his daughter So when
you all came around he called me
first thing Protecting his
interests as it were Which
entails certainly for him
remaining in my good favor

Clarence is frowning at Jonah

JONAH (CONTD)
I see you’re a bit slow son I
dabble in all sorts of business
here and I’m sure I don’t need to
tell you that a girl like Katie
Jane can be worth a considerable
amount of money Keeping her on
just in one of my clubs she could
bring in a couple hundred grand a
year Put her in a few tapes - and
I know I don’t have y’all’s
production values but we do some
good business on the trucker
circuit catering to shall we say
the needs for more extreme fare
generally featuring somewhat
younger performers you know and
that’s quite a bit of profit too
I know you understand this I know
that’s why you’re here But you
see my arrangement with Mr
Andrews predates any sort of
agreement you may have come to with
his daughter

There is a silence as Jonah waits for a response Clarence
looks around the room then back at Jonah

CLARENCE
What I’m sorry I wasn’t paying
attention

Jonah frowns at Clarence chewing on ice from his drink

JONAH
Don’t provoke me boy The fact
that you’re even alive to be
hearing these words can be either
chalked up to some sort of
incredible luck on your end or the
equally incredible fucking
incompetence of these two nimrods
who somehow missed shooting you at
a range of a few feet with a
goddamned assault rifle

These last few words are spat in the direction of Fitz and
Derrick both of whom avert their eyes

JONAH (CONTD)

Fitz here who also happens to owe
me just a bit of funds was asked
to do just one fucking thing but
apparently is too fucking blind to
hit the broad side of a barn
leaving you running around to God
knows where Our fucking luck you
got picked up by the sheriff

Jonah looks over his shoulder at Michael

JONAH (CONTD)
In fact Michael I think it’s
time Why don’t you and Fitz go
have a conversation about his
performance tonight See if you
can’t clarify to him exactly what
he did wrong

Michael his expression dreamy moves forward gesturing for
Fitz to precede him in exiting the room Fitz looking
terrified leaves through the hallway Michael follows

Jonah rises from the couch with an effort using a cane with
a silver handle

JONAH (CONTD)
Derrick would you help our guest
into the entertainment room I
imagine he’s going to want to see
this

Derrick lifts Clarence to his feet They follow Jonah towards
a back room

INT JONAH’S MANSION - ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Using the cane to walk Jonah moves into a room with a wall
of television screens Derrick and Clarence follow behind

The dozen or so television screens all show different angles
of the cornfield into which a labyrinthine MAZE has been cut
in the tall corn There are cameras placed throughout this
maze their different angles showing on the screens

Jonah sits down in a rocking chair facing the wall

JONAH
You ever seen a cornfield maze
before

Clarence says nothing

DERRICK
Maize is the Indian word for corn

Jonah frowns at Derrick

JONAH

Well ain’t you a wealth of
interesting information

(to Clarence)
You see I run a cornfield maze
haunt out here every October
leading up to Halloween as just
one of my many ways of giving back
to the community I’m regarded as
quite the philanthropist in Great
Bend ain’t I Derrick

DERRICK
(to Clarence sincere)
He is

JONAH
Of course the other eleven months
out of the year the corn maze
don’t see much use I sure as fuck
ain’t growing no crops here But
every now and then it comes in
handy Ah there he is

In one of the bottom screens Fitz moves into view followed
by Michael who is aiming a gun at him They are facing the
entrance to the maze

Derrick’s eyes widen when he sees this

EXT JONAH’S MANSION - BACKYARD - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Fitz stands in front of the gap in the corn that leads into
the maze pleading Michael is aiming a revolver at him

FITZ
Come on Michael please just let
me go I can get Jonah his money

MICHAEL
Oh How are you planning to do
that

Fitz hesitates as if trying to think of something

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Nah You’ve got nothing and you’ve
fucked up too many times Get
going I’ll give you at least a
minute’s head start I promise
Fitz

FITZ
Michael please

Michael FIRES THE GUN the bullet hitting the soil inches
from one of Fitzs feet Fitz leaps away startled

MICHAEL
Go on

As Michael lifts the gun higher Fitz turns and runs into the
maze

EXT CORNFIELD MAZE - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Fitz runs down the dark path surrounded on either side by
corn The cornfield is mostly visible by moonlight

Fitz reaches an intersection in the maze He looks
frantically right then left trying to decide in which
direction to go then takes off down the left path

As he runs he passes by a small camera mounted on a stalk
in the corner of the maze that follows him as he runs Fitz
does not notice this

Continuing down the maze Fitz rounds a corner and finds
himself suddenly facing a life-size SKELETON which bounces
on a wire LAUGHING SHRILLY

Fitz gives a sharp SCREAM of terror stumbling back He
stares at the fake mechanical skeleton for a second then
takes off running again

INT JONAH’S MANSION - ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jonah is laughing heartily his face red as he watches Fitz
run through the maze on various screens

JONAH
Oh The skeleton got him It always
does Always gets ‘em

Clarence and Derrick both stare at him then back at the
television screens

EXT CORNFIELD MAZE - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Fitz runs past a pair of GLOWING RED LIGHTS in the corn
designed to look like EVIL EYES

Turning a corner Fitz slams his shoulder into a SCARECROW
with a WITCH MASK for a face which is bound to a post A

recording device somewhere on the scarecrow emits an EERIE
MOANING sound

Fitz looks up at the scarecrow clutching his shoulder then
moves on

From far behind Fitz the sound of DOGS BARKING can be heard
Fitz looks back in horror

EXT JONAH’S MANSION - BACKYARD - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

A BUTLER is leading three large dogs DOBERMAN PINSCHERS on
chains from around the house Michael nods over at the butler
as he approaches

The dogs TUG ON THEIR CHAINS in the direction of the maze
BARKING The butler pulling back on their leashes restrains
them with an effort

Michael lights a cigarette staring off into the cornfield

BUTLER
Should I release them sir

MICHAEL
(lightly)
In a minute

INT JONAH’S MANSION - ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The butler and the dogs are visible on one of the lower
screens the one that showed Michael and Fitz earlier

Derrick takes a step back from the screens Jonah addresses
Clarence

JONAH
The thing is he could get through
the maze you know There is an
exit ‘Course when the kids go
through there for fun it takes ‘em
at least an hour But look he’s
running pretty fast

In one of the top screens Fitz is indeed visible running
quickly down a long path

On the bottom screen Michael gestures sharply towards the
cornfields

MICHAEL (ON TELEVISION)
Now Let ‘em go

The butler on the television screen releases the dogs
which race into the maze barking
EXT CORNFIELD MAZE - LATE EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

Fitz is running faster and even more frantically now that the
BARKING of the dogs can be heard moving closer to him

Fitz turns a corner in the maze and finds himself suddenly
facing a dark WALL OF CORN He is at a DEAD END

FITZ
Fuck Fuck

With a quick look back Fitz begins plowing forward into the
dead end into the corn PUSHING THE STALKS ASIDE out of his
way The barking of the Dobermans is getting LOUDER

INT JONAH’S MANSION - ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
On the televisions Fitz can be dimly discerned on one of the
screens trying to push his way into the cornfield The

camera angle is lousy from far away

Jonah angrily shouts up at the screen

JONAH
Aw he can’t do that That’s
cheating

EXT CORNFIELD MAZE - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Fitz pushing further into the corn suddenly gives a YELL OF
PAIN

Drawing his arm back from the corn his shirt sleeve is torn
away his forearm BLEEDING from several deep scratches A
BARBED WIRE GRID FENCE as tall as the corn stands just a
few feet within the cornfield

Fitz pulls his other hand away from the barbed wire there is
a deep puncture wound in his palm that is oozing blood He
stares at the barbed wire trying to see if there is a way
past it but appears to encompass the entire wall

FITZ
Shit

Fitz panicked turns and begins running in the other
direction retracing his steps

INT JONAH’S MANSION - ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jonah smiles broadly up at the image of Fitz running back
through the maze on the television screens He leans over
towards Clarence confiding

JONAH
Barb wire We tell ‘em we need it
sturdy to keep the corn that high
(pause)

‘Course I wanted to use razor
wire but Michael convinced me it’d
be harder to explain if one of them
dumb-ass kids stumbled into it

EXT CORNFIELD MAZE - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

The BARKING of the dogs is growing LOUDER

Fitz reaches another intersection this one featuring a
HOWLING GHOST represented by two black eyes painted on a
white sheet which moves back and forth on an automated

clothesline

The dogs sounds as if they are RIGHT BEHIND Fitz
Desperately he chooses a direction running off to the left

INT JONAH’S MANSION - ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jonah laughs up at the wall of screens in delight

JONAH
Oops Bad choice

EXT CORNFIELD MAZE - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Fitz rounds a corner then another then suddenly finds
himself facing yet another DEAD END

With a scream of fear and frustration Fitz turns around and
begins running back the way he came towards the intersection
with the ghost

As he does so the three DOBERMANS emerge from behind the
ghost RACING TOWARDS HIM

Fitz reverses direction so quickly he almost slips
scrambling back towards the dead end the dogs RUSHING AFTER
HIM

Fitz reaches the dead end and rushes INTO THE CORN He hits
the barbed wire fence and oblivious to the cuts he is
receiving begins trying to force his way through it as the
dogs move in behind him

The lead dog LUNGES UP and BITES onto Fitz’s back KNOCKING
HIM TO THE GROUND The three dogs then converge up Fitz
biting him as he struggles and flails on the ground They
begin TEARING HIM APART

INT JONAH’S MANSION - ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

On one of the television screens the dogs can be seen biting
and tearing at Fitz Fitz is soaked in blood and no longer
moving He is clearly DEAD

Jonah smiles at the screen then looks over at Clarence

JONAH
Of course these videos right here
do quite alright on the circuit
too once we edit this all
together I guess people like the
suspense of it compared to all that
other snuff junk

Jonah rises laboriously to his feet

JONAH (CONTD)
Come on now let’s head on out
back and have a chat with Michael
Help him get things cleaned up

Jonah begins moving towards the door Derrick is still
looking up at the screen in shock watching the dogs rip
apart Fitz’s corpse

Jonah clears his throat sharply

JONAH (CONTD)
Derrick I said come on

Derrick gives a nervous start

DERRICK
Yes sir

Grabbing onto Clarence’s cuffed arms again Derrick begins
leading him after Jonah as they exit the entertainment room

EXT JONAH’S MANSION - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Clarence Jonah and Derrick emerge from the mansion out into
the backyard As soon as Jonah steps outside he gives a
sharp WHISTLE and calls out towards the corn maze

JONAH
Come on now Here

Michael and the butler are standing nearby watching them
Michael lifts one foot and grinds his cigarette out on the
sole of his shoe

MICHAEL
How’s the footage boss

JONAH
Fine Just fine They took him down
real good

A moment later the three dogs emerge from the corn maze
their jaws dripping with BLOOD They all trot over to Jonah
tails wagging

Jonah pets the dogs rubbing their heads The dogs wiggle
with excitement

JONAH (CONTD)
Oh you’re good boys Yes you are
Good boys

Clarence and Derrick both take a step away from the bloody
dogs The butler comes over and begins reattaching the
Dobermans’ leashes to their collars

BUTLER
Do you want me to take them in and
clean them up now sir

JONAH
Clean them off just enough so
they’1l catch a new scent but
don’t feed them nothin’
(looks at Clarence)
I think we’ve still got one more
show scheduled for the evening

Clarence stares at the maze as the butler begins leading the
dogs away back around the house Jonah turns to Michael

JONAH (CONTD)
Michael go in and get that body
out of there so it don’t confuse
‘em It’s in the north quadrant by
the ghost You can put it in the
ground tomorrow

MICHAEL
Sure

Michael moves into the maze Jonah turns back towards
Clarence

JONAH
I’m sorry son but you knew I
weren’t about to let you live you
knowing about my business now and
wanting what’s mine You’ve got to
go For what’s it’s worth I know
it didn’t look like it but my dogs
are usually pretty quick They’re
trained to go for the throat

Clarence nods smiling understandingly

CLARENCE
That’s perfectly reasonable It’s
just business

JONAH
Well I’m glad you see it that way
I certainly-

In a sudden movement Clarence wrenches his arm out of
Derrick’s grasp and begins RUNNING as fast as he can with his
arms cuffed behind his back moving around the house
disappearing from view

Jonah stares after him in exasperation

JONAH (CONTD)
Well what in the hell-
(to Derrick)
Go get him

Derrick startled draws a pistol from the inside of his
jacket and begins running after Clarence

A moment later though Clarence emerges back from the side
of the house a grim expression on his face Derrick stops
running and starts to laugh

The sheriff is walking behind Clarence marching him back
towards Jonah a gun pressed against the back of Clarence’s
head

The sheriff is flushed and sweating chewing on a cigar His
belt buckle is unfastened

SHERIFF CONRAD
Hey Jonah Something get away from
you again Jeez can’t you fellas
keep a hold of this boy for as long
as it takes for me to get my rocks
off

JONAH
(amused)
Yes well once again sheriff you
have my gratitude It would have
been quite a hassle to chase him
down I’m sure Speaking of
though how was she

SHERIFF CONRAD

Oh fine real nice

(laughs)
You got yourself quite a bargain
with that one She’s going to be an
earner I can tell you that Where
is she now I brought her back
here She’s just being shy

(calls out)
Katie Jane Get the fuck back here

Clarence turns to look the sheriff still holding the
revolver to his head

From the side of the house Katie Jane emerges her head
lowered She is wearing a small robe and slippers Her face
is shiny and she has tears in her eyes

As soon as Katie Jane sees Clarence she runs towards him

KATIE JANE
Oh my God Clarence Oh I’m so
sorry

Katie Jane rushes towards Clarence and embraces him wrapping
her arms around his waist She sobs against his chest

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
I didn’t mean to get you all
involved in this Why did you
come after me

Clarence stares down at her in surprise

CLARENCE
I uh

JONAH
Well ain’t that sweet
(to Derrick)
Get her the fuck off him

Derrick pulls Katie Jane away from Clarence She stares after
him her eyes filled with tears but with an incongruously
meaningful expression in her eyes

Clarence stares back at her Behind him one of his hands is
holding the KEY TO HIS CUFFS which Katie Jane just slipped
to him Clarence wraps it tightly in one of his fists

SHERIFF CONRAD
I heard the dogs barkin’ out here
while your girl was taking care of
the Little Sheriff I’m assuming
that was Fitz You gonna feed this
one to ‘em too

JONAH
Reckon so unless you got a better
idea You need a guy to evade
arrest for something sheriff

SHERIFF CONRAD
(laughs)
No not at the moment though I do
appreciate your asking No I think
the dogs’d be fine for this one
He’s big and strong
(MORE)

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONTD)
Give ‘em some exercise maybe
Can’t imagine Fitz put up too much
of a run

JONAH
No not much
(to Derrick)
Take her back inside and put her in
the studio I may feel like having
a bit of fun before bed

Jonah winks at Katie Jane who gives him a look somewhere
between disgust and fear before Derrick begins dragging her
away through the rear door of the mansion

Katie Jane shoots Clarence one last pleading look then
Derrick shoves her inside

DERRICK
Go on

Derrick moves in after Katie Jane closing the mansion’s rear
door The sheriff watches Derrick depart

SHERIFF CONRAD
He’s turning out real okay that
one there

JONAH

Yah I shoulda’ had him do the
shooting earlier but Fitz is the
one what owed me

(to Clarence)
That boy Derrick was quarterback of
the football team starting his
senior year of high school a real
star in this town Had a couple of
big schools looking at him too
‘til he tore out his rotator cuff
Can’t throw much of anything now
but I figured he’s still a talent
to have

CLARENCE
(laughs)
Yeah I bet you did

Jonah frowns at Clarence
JONAH

I don’t quite get the gist of that
remark

CLARENCE
Well it’s just what kind of grown-
up man gives a fuck about high
school football Seems to me you’d
have to be a pederast to watch that
sort of thing

The sheriff and Jonah exchange a look

SHERIFF CONRAD
“Pederast”

JONAH
He’s calling me a faggot Conrad

The sheriff lifts the gun again jabbing it into the side of
Clarence’s head

SHERIFF CONRAD
You little shit I don’t think you
get the situation here-

Clarence cranks the key behind his back releasing one side
of his cuffs FREEING HIS HANDS

In a quick motion Clarence steps to the side grabs the gun
out of the sheriff’s hand and PUNCHES the sheriff IN THE FACE
with the unfastened cuff wrapped around his hand like brass
knuckles The sheriff stumbles back from the blow

Clarence spins aiming the gun at Jonah who raises his
hands

JONAH
I’m unarmed

CLARENCE
(snarling)
I should kill you both

The handcuffs are hanging from the wrist of Clarence’s gun
hand He unlocks the cuffs and tosses them to Jonah who
catches them Clarence points at the sheriff

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Cuff yourselves together

Jonah moves towards the sheriff The sheriff is staring at
Clarence his face bleeding Clarence moves back so he can
cover them both with the gun

SHERIFF CONRAD
Don’t do it Jonah Ain’t no need
(to Clarence)
(MORE)

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONTD)
Think about this boy You gonna
shoot a cop Let’s talk this
through

As he talks the sheriff is moving slowly towards Clarence
his hands out

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
See that ain’t my gun there I
left mine back in the car That’s
the gun I took off of you which
means they can trace the bullets
back to you And you shoot a cop in
this state a sheriff all kinds of
hell are gonna come down on you
You want that

Clarence SHOOTS THE SHERIFF in the knee The sheriff falls to
the ground with a CRY of shock and pain blood pouring from
his shattering kneecap

CLARENCE
I tried to tell you earlier It’s
not my gun

Clarence quickly aims the gun at Jonah’ legs

CLARENCE (CONTD)
You going to cuff yourself to him
or do I have to do you too

Moving with surprising speed Jonah kneels down next to this
sheriff and cuffs one of his wrists to one of the sheriffs

JONAH
This alright

Clarence leans down and tightens the handcuffs until Jonah
gives a grunt of pain The sheriff is moaning in agony
clutching his knee

CLARENCE
Yeah that’1ll do

Clarence reaches into the sheriffs pants pocket and pulls
out his set of car keys He then gives a quick glance over to
the cornfield there is nothing there to be seen

Clarence turns and runs towards the back door to the house

INT JONAH’S MANSION - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

Clarence runs up the stairs to the second floor the gun in
his hand A MUFFLED SCREAM comes from down the upstairs hall
Clarence moves in this direction

INT JONAH’S MANSION - STUDIO ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Clarence KICKS OPEN the door to a room and moves inside

The room is brightly lit with stark white walls and
carpeting At one end a video camera on a tripod faces a
large bed with pink sheets Handcuffs are attached to each of
the bed’s four posts

On the bed Katie Jane is STRUGGLING with Derrick who is on
top of her trying to remove her nightgown

Derrick stops when he sees Clarence and the gun quickly
rolling off of Katie Jane his hands in the air

DERRICK
Whoa hey man look it’s not-

Clarence crosses quickly over to Derrick and PISTOL WHIPS
HIM cracking the barrel of the gun across Derrick’s
forehead

When Derrick drops to one knee clutching his bloody face
Clarence brings the butt of the gun down on the top of
Derrick’s head Derrick falls forward and is still

Clarence looks over at Katie Jane who is cowering on the
bed staring at Derrick in fear

KATIE JANE
Is he dead

CLARENCE
No Just out Where’s your stuff

KATIE JANE
I don’t know where my clothes are

Katie Jane begins wrapping her robe around herself

CLARENCE
Okay By “stuff” I was partially
referring to the cash that we gave
you

KATIE JANE
It’s not here I hid it

CLARENCE
Then let’s go

Clarence sticks the pistol in his waistband turns towards
the door to the room and sees MICHAEL standing in the
doorway watching him

MICHAEL
Interesting

Michael moves forward very quickly Clarence grabs the gun
from his waistband but as he extends it Michael KNOCKS THE
GUN FROM HIS HAND with an outward crescent kick

As Michael moves in kicking for Clarence’s knee with his
other foot Clarence steps back into a defensive fighting
stance

Michael punches Clarence several times Clarence blocks some
of the strikes but Michael is faster than him throwing

combinations of chops and hits that leave Clarence staggering
back

Michael extends a finger strike into Clarence’s windpipe and
simultaneously cross-kicks Clarence in the shin Clarence
FALLS TO HIS KNEES clutching his throat and choking Michael
kicks Clarence TWICE IN THE HEAD in quick succession

Clarence blocks his head with his forearms covering up and
swaying like a punch-drunk boxer Blood is flowing from his
mouth and nose

Michael shifts closer to Clarence his hands raised looking
for an angle at which to finish him off

The side of Michael’s head EXPLODES with a gunshot Blood and
brains splatter the nearest wall Michael stands for a
moment then his body falls to the floor A pool of blood
begins forming on the white carpet next to the exit wound in
his skull

Katie Jane is holding the revolver that Michael kicked out of
Clarence’s hand smoke rises from the barrel She is
trembling With a short CRY OF DISGUST she drops the gun

Clarence crawls over and picks the gun up off the floor His
speech is muffled through his bloody lips

CLARENCE
We might need that

Clarence tries to rise to his feet but stumbles dizzy He
leans up against the wall one hand braced against it

Katie Jane quickly moves over to Clarence She hefts one of
his arms over her shoulders so that she can partially support
his weight

CLARENCE (CONTD)
I’m fine I just need a second

KATIE JANE
I know but we gotta go Come on

Katie Jane and Clarence exit the room Katie Jane staggering
under Clarence’s weight
EXT JONAH’S MANSION - FRONT DRIVE - MOMENTS LATER

Katie Jane and Clarence stumble out of the mansion’s front
door

CLARENCE
Sheriffs car I’ve got the keys

Katie Jane looks at him incredulously
KATIE JANE
You didn’t think to take something
a little less conspicuous
Clarence grunts
They make their way over to the sheriff’s car Around the
back of the house the sound of the Dobermans BARKING can be

heard Clarence looks back at this noise

CLARENCE
Get in

Clarence opens the driver’s door the sheriff’s car and pushes
Katie Jane in She slides over to the passenger side

Around the side of the house the three DOBERMANS APPEAR
racing towards them

Clarence supporting his weight on the car door angles his
body into the driver’s seat He SHUTS THE CAR DOOR after him
just as the DOGS REACH IT

INT SHERIFF’S CAR - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

One of the Dobermans SLAMS into the car door leaping up its
nails clawing on the window glass

Clarence exhales He inserts the ignition key and starts the
car shifting into REVERSE

The dogs are still leaping up and BARKING on the drivers
side of the car trying to get in at Clarence their breath
fogging the glass

Clarence hits the gas and the car FLIES BACKWARDS the
drivers side rearview mirror hitting one of the dogs in the
head and knocking it spinning

Clarence pulls out onto the rural route and begins driving
away from Jonah’ mansion The dogs chase the car for a couple
hundred feet but are soon left behind

Clarence sees his lock kit resting on the dashboard in front
of Katie Jane He reaches for it and pockets it looking
around the car

CLARENCE
There should be another gun in
here Find it

Katie Jane opens the glove compartment and pulls out a
gigantic 50 caliber chrome revolver Clarence gives it a
contemptuous glance

CLARENCE (CONTD)
Yeah that’d be it Give it here

Katie Jane hands Clarence the giant handgun

KATIE JANE
What is that fifty cal I can tell
you for a fact he is compensating
for something

CLARENCE
(grimacing)
Don’t need to know the details

KATIE JANE
Okay Sorry You kill them

CLARENCE
No Left them cuffed together Shot
the sheriff in the leg but aimed
for the bone He won’t bleed out

KATIE JANE
Oh
(pause)
Too bad
(MORE )

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
(pause)
Where we headed

CLARENCE
Where’s the money

KATIE JANE
I got a safety deposit box at the
bank my first morning back in town
I figured that was the only way to
keep anyone from finding out about
it It’s in there We can get it
tomorrow when they open

CLARENCE
You had a chance to get away and do
that

KATIE JANE

Yeah I was staying with my daddy
that first night Jonah knew I
wouldn’t run

CLARENCE
Who took you away from Los Angeles

KATIE JANE

Michael that fella I just shot
and Derrick the one you beat with
the pistol They didn’t tell me the
deal until I got here They told me
my daddy was sick at first and
they’d come to bring me to the
hospital

(staring out the window)
He’s sick alright

They drive in silence for a moment

CLARENCE
I don’t get it Your father sold
you to pay off his gambling debts
Couldn’t you have just given Jonah
the money and got out of it

Katie Jane turns to him wide eyed

KATIE JANE
Oh but I couldn’t do that That
money was for acting I was supposed
to do After I left Los Angeles
that money wasn’t mine any more I
knew I’d have to send it back

Clarence looks at her Katie Jane stares back at him
apparently sincere Clarence turns his attention back to the
road in front of him

EXT SIDE STREET - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

Several blocks away from the hotel Clarence pulls the
sheriffs car over at the curb of a dark business district
The street is quiet and completely deserted

INT SHERIFF’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Removing a cleansing wipe from the packet in his jacket

vehicle smearing clean the steering wheel gear shift and
every other surface that either he or Katie Jane touched

EXT SHERIFF’S CAR - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Stepping out of the car Clarence continues the process on
the outside of the vehicle cleaning the edges of the door
and the door handles Clarence then folds the dirty wipes
into his pocket

Glancing at the trunk of the car Clarence hesitates then
crosses to the trunk and opens it with the sheriff’s keys

Inside the trunk are miscellaneous supplies a spare tire
boxes of ammunition a mag light Also on a suspended rack
is a single barrel shotgun and beneath it a folded
BULLETPROOF VEST

Clarence grabs one of the boxes of bullets Ignoring the
shotgun Clarence then reaches in and takes out the

KATIE JANE
I took a shower but I didn’t turn

just I needed to get clean

CLARENCE
It’s okay We should get you some
clothes Here you can wear some of

Still not looking at Katie Jane Clarence lifts his duffel
bag up onto the bed and unzips it He removes his video
camera which is on top of his clothing then pulls out a
white dress shirt He hands the shirt to Katie Jane and
continues fishing through his bag

CLARENCE (CONTD)
I’ve got some boxers here you
could

Katie Jane drops her towel to the floor revealing her nude
body and slips on Clarence’s dress shirt She begins
buttoning the front of the shirt over her chest

Clarence stares at her then forces his attention back to his
duffel back

CLARENCE (CONT’D)
-wear Here

Clarence hands Katie Jane a pair of cotton boxer shorts
Turning from him she pulls them on then looks down at

Katie Jane embraces Clarence hugging him Clarence stiffens
uncomfortably

KATIE JANE

There is a silence Clarence gestures awkwardly

CLARENCE
I know that Listen I should- I
should tell you I just don’t

don’t um do so well with that

KATIE JANE
Why not

CLARENCE
I don’t know It wasn’t so bad at
first when I got back from
Afghanistan But these past couple
of years it’s gotten worse and
worse

Katie Jane looks at the camera on the bed

KATIE JANE
Do you think it’s because of your
job

CLARENCE
I don’t know
(pause)
I don’t like to think about it very
much

KATIE JANE
Mmm-hmm

Katie Jane walks over to the bed and picks up the camera

face He allows Katie Jane to lead him towards the bed where
she begins undressing him

Katie Jane pushes Clarence gently down onto the bed so that
he is lying on his back aiming the camera up at her She
climbs on top of him and they kiss passionately

CLARENCE
Wait

Clarence sets the camera down on a small table next to the
bed aiming it towards them He swivels the view screen
around on the camera so that it is facing him

Katie Jane continues kissing Clarence throughout this
process mounting him He turns his attention back to her

continues to ride him

are closed Clarence looks up at the ceiling

CLARENCE
It’s been kind of a long time

Katie Jane smiles not opening her eyes

KATIE JANE
(mumbling sleepy)
Go to sleep

Katie Jane begins breathing rhythmically as she drifts off
Clarence continues looking up at the ceiling then he slowly
closes his eyes

INT HOTEL - ROOM FIFTEEN - EARLY MORNING

Clarence and Katie Jane lie in bed in roughly the same
positions Dim morning light creeps in around the hotel
room’s blinds

Suddenly the door to the hotel room is loudly BROKEN IN
flooding the room with LIGHT Three men visible only as
SILHOUETTES enter the room one of them holding the
SLEDGEHAMMER they used to knock open the door

Both Katie Jane and Clarence are awake Katie Jane SCREAMS
shrinking away and covering her body with the blanket

Clarence naked and confused tries to rise up One of his
hands reaches UNDER HIS PILLOW

One of the silhouettes steps rapidly towards him His eyes
adjusting to the light Clarence can see that it is DERRICK

The top of Derrick’s head is bandaged and he is holding a
collapsible baton which he FLICKS OUT to its full length
shoving Clarence back onto the bed with his other hand

DERRICK
Payback motherfucker

Derrick SWINGS THE BATON into the side of Clarence’s head
with both hands Clarence’s world GOES BLACK

INT HOTEL - ROOM FIFTEEN - LATE MORNING

Clarence blinks his eyes open He is naked lying on his back
on the floor of the hotel room looking up A FIGURE is
standing above him

The figure is blurry then slowly comes into focus It is
AGATHA standing with her hands on her hips looking down

AGATHA
This isn’t your room Mr Smith

Clarence tries to speak but cannot The entire side of his
head is crusted BLACK with dried blood which has pooled out
onto the carpet He tries to speak again his voice coming
out thin and raspy

CLARENCE
I know that

AGATHA
Well And I’d like to know who’s
going to pay for this mess That
door’s going to need replacing you

Clarence struggles to rise finally moving up into a seated
position on the floor He holds his head in his hands
swaying back and forth

AGATHA (CONT’D)

CLARENCE
(slowly)
No
AGATHA

Well that’s good Not that it’s
much of my business but I reckon

CLARENCE
Yes I should do that

Clarence very slowly rises to his feet then sits back on the
bed

CLARENCE (CONTD)
There was a girl here with me
Blonde young pretty Did you see

AGATHA

(distasteful)
No I did not I came out to do my
housekeeping rounds this morning

Clarence lifts up his pillow on the bed Both of the GUNS are
beneath it the sheriff’s large revolver and the pistol he
took from Creek

CLARENCE
Id appreciate it if you’d hold off
on that phone call please

AGATHA
(eyes wide)
Well Alright

Clarence picks up both of the guns and tosses them into his
duffel bag He then throws the video camera into the bag and
begins putting on his clothes

Buttoning his shirt Clarence again rises to his feet more
steadily this time He crouches next to Justin’s luggage and
begins rooting through it beneath the sheriff’s bulletproof
vest which is folded on top of Justin’s clothing

CLARENCE
When you call the police How are
you going to describe me

AGATHA
Um How do you mean
CLARENCE
I mean how would you describe me
AGATHA
Well I’d say you’re about six foot

hundred pounds

Clarence produces a small roll of bills from Justins
luggage He removes the band from it and peels off a few
bills all of which are hundreds

Clarence pockets the few bills and then tosses the rest of
the roll to Agatha who catches it She begins unrolling the
bills impressed

CLARENCE
How would you describe me

Agatha looks at the money then back up at Clarence

AGATHA

drawing the sheriff’s revolver with his other hand

A moment later the door is opened by Skeeter who is
blearily rubbing his face His eyes widen when he sees
Clarence

Clarence HITS Skeeter in the face with the butt of the
sheriffs revolver knocking him out of view Clarence then
steps into the house shutting the door behind him

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Skeeter lays sprawled out on the floor clutching his face
with one hand fumbling for a straight razor in his belt with
the other

Clarence STOMPS down on Skeeter’s groin and Skeeter folds up
retching the razor falling from his fingers Clarence moves
to stand away from the bear trap on the ceiling and looks
around the room

Jesse is seated on the sofa frozen a small bag of meth
crystals in one hand staring at Clarence A scale rests on
the coffee table in front of him

Cooter is curled up on the floor next to the corpse of
Champ the dog Cooter is smoking meth using two pieces of
tinfoil holding a plastic lighter to melt the meth He
continues sucking on the rolled piece of tinfoil looking up
at Clarence through a haze of smoke

Clarence addresses Jesse tucking the sheriff’s gun back into
his pants

CLARENCE
I need to talk to you

Jesse is still staring at Clarence and holding the bag of
meth crystals

JESSE
You have my attention

CLARENCE
Where’s the other one of you Is he
going to run in here and do
something stupid

JESSE
Creek

Clarence looks at Jesse for a second then pulls the gun he
took from Creek out of his waistband and wipes it clean on
his shirt

CLARENCE
Here’s his gun back

Clarence tosses the gun to Jesse who catches it

Jesse cocks the gun aims it at Clarence and pulls the
trigger The gun clicks EMPTY Jesse examines it

JESSE
You took the bullets out

(clearing his throat)
Yes I did
JESSE
Huh

Jesse sets the gun down and looks back up at Clarence who is
watching Cooter Cooter has run out of meth on the tinfoil
but is continuing to try to smoke the blackened remains
making frustrated noises

JESSE (CONTD)
Id heard you fellas were dead

JESSE

Skeeter wheezing heavily has crawled over to the sofa and
propped himself up against it facing Clarence

SKEETER
Jesse What’s he doing here

JESSE
Oh yeah
(to Clarence)
You had somethin’ to tell me

CLARENCE
Yes It’s about your sister Katie
Jane You know a guy named Jonah
lives in an old mansion about
thirty miles south of here

Before Jesse can respond Creek walks into the room looking
sleepy

CREEK
Hey what’s with all the damn
commotion

When Creek sees Clarence his eyes widen

CREEK (CONTD)
Motherfucker

Creek runs at Clarence fists raised

CLARENCE
Goddammit

Clarence shuffles his feet and KICKS Creek in the stomach as
Creek comes at him Creek flies back landing on the floor
His mouth opens and closes as he GASPS FOR BREATH

Jesse is nodding and smiling

JESSE
See I told you so
(to Creek)

Hey Creek look The man brought
back your gun

Jesse tosses the gun to Creek it lands on the floor nearby
and slides over to him Creek immediately lifts the gun
cocks it and aims it at Clarence pulling the trigger The
gun again clicks empty

Creek continues trying to shoot Clarence the gun CLICKING
again and again Clarence sighs and turns back to Jesse

CLARENCE
Jonah Some kind of country-fried
mafioso looks like a fat Colonel
Sanders You know him

Creek stops trying to shoot Clarence and begins examining his
gun puzzled

JESSE
Yeah Jonah I more ‘an know him
Had business dealings with him in
the past ‘Course he mainly stays
out of the meth trade That’s ours

Jesse smiles revealing dark teeth Creek is staring in the
empty chamber of the gun

CREEK
Hey Jesse we got any more bullets
for this gun

JESSE

In a bit Creek
(to Clarence)

You were saying

CLARENCE
You know Jonah he dabbles in the
adult entertainment business a bit
himself Or so he claims

JESSE
I did know that

SKEETER
‘Strue He got houses of ill
repute

Clarence looks at Skeeter then back at Jesse

CLARENCE
Well did you know that your father
sold Katie Jane to Jonah to pay off
his gambling debts That’s why he
doesn’t want anyone to know where
she is because she’s at Jonah’
place where he’s planning to pimp
her out and put her in his movies
until he’s made his money back
Plus presumably interest

Jesse is watching Clarence Clarence nods
JESSE
(slowly)
That’s true huh

CLARENCE
For a fact

JESSE
Jonah is gonna put KJ in his
flicks

CLARENCE

I saw the set myself

JESSE
Huh

Creek and Skeeter are both watching this conversation
intently Cooter is resting his head on Champ and glaring at
Clarence’s feet

CREEK
Hey Jesse

JESSE
Yeah

CREEK

You remember when Scott Hobbes
showed us that one video Jonah made
with that girl and the dog

JESSE
Shut up Creek I’m trying to think
here

CREEK
Well It’s just Remember how

at the end when it was done the
dog just wouldn’t stop barking at
her

JESSE
I said shut up Creek

Creek falls into an introspective silence Jesse continues
staring off into space chewing on his lower lip

CLARENCE
You don’t believe me we can go to
your father’s place ask him Or
just go straight to Jonah

Jesse abruptly rises to his feet

JESSE
Let’s go talk to Pops Cooter you

drill set all the traps and kill
anything that ain’t a customer

JESSE
(nodding)
That was smart Get in the truck
Creek you ride in back

INT JESSE’S PICK-UP TRUCK - AFTERNOON - A HALF HOUR LATER

Clarence sits in the front seat of Jesse’s rusted old pick-
up truck sandwiched in between Skeeter in the passenger
seat who is looking sullenly out the window and Jesse
whose expression is stony as he steers the truck down a dirt
road towards the trailer park

A shotgun rack is visible behind the truck’s seats Clarence
looks at the two brothers then looks straight ahead

EXT TRAILER PARK - AFTERNOON - MINUTES LATER

Jesse pulls the truck over in front of Jake Andrews’ trailer
sending up a cloud of dust Creek immediately leaps out of
the bed of the truck his hair disheveled Clarence Jesse
and Skeeter all climb out of the front of the truck

CLARENCE
What if he’s not home

JESSE
That ain’t too likely

Jesse climbs the stairs to the door of his father’s trailer
and knocks on the door

JESSE (CONTD)
Pop We’re comin’ in

Jesse opens the door and walks inside followed by Clarence
Skeeter and Creek remain outside Skeeter lighting a
cigarette

INT JAKE ANDREWS TRAILER - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS
Clarence and Jesse move into the dimly lit trailer

Jake Andrews is seated on a small sofa across from a
television watching wrestling and drinking from a can of
beer He looks up as Jesse enters then frowns at Clarence in
surprise

JAKE ANDREWS
Jesse what ah what are you doing
here

JESSE
Just dropped by for a visit Creek
and Skeeter are outside

JAKE ANDREWS
Ah Well Id offer you boys a
beer but I’ve only got one left I

store as soon as the sun went down

Jesse nods looking around the cluttered trailer

JESSE
Dont look like KJ’s been staying

JAKE ANDREWS
No she hasn’t I told you that

Jesse nods

CLARENCE
Mr Andrews do you remember me

JAKE ANDREWS
Fellow from Los Angeles looking
for my daughter Of course I

drunk

Jake Andrews sets the empty can of beer down his hand
trembling

CLARENCE
Well I found her

JAKE ANDREWS
You did
(pause)
Uh Where at

Jesse lunges forward and PUNCHES his father in the face
knocking him down across the sofa Jesse straddles his father
on the sofa punching him again and again with his skinny
fists

JESSE
You fucking sold her didn’t you
You fucking sent her to Jonah to
cover your goddamn betting debts
Didn’t you

Clarence watches this altercation passively Jesse isn’t
doing much damage with his punches but his father is too
frail to block him and his nose has begun bleeding

JAKE ANDREWS
Yes Yes alright

Jesse stops hitting him Jake looks up pleadingly

JAKE ANDREWS (CONT’D)
But I didn’t sell her More
like she’s just like working
for him for a little while to pay
off what I owe

Jesse begins hitting Jake again

JESSE
You fucking goddamned worthless
piece of shit drunk motherfucker

JAKE ANDREWS
Hey Hey

Jesse pauses

JAKE ANDREWS (CONT’D)
You think I don’t know why you’re
so upset You think you’d be so
upset if it was one of your
brothers

(MORE )

JAKE ANDREWS (CONT’D)
You think I don’t know what you and
your sister used to do together

Jesses eyes widen He grabs an empty bottle of whiskey up
off the floor

JESSE
You goddamn

Clarence moves quickly behind Jesse grabbing his arm as he
starts to swing the bottle forward Pinning Jesse’s arms
Clarence hauls him off the sofa and away from Jake Andrews

JESSE (CONTD)
Oh and what did you do Ask him
Ask him what he used to do to her
When she was just a kid A kid

Clarence pushes Jesse away and turns to look at Jake Andrews
who has righted himself on the sofa and is holding one hand
to his bloody nose Jake Andrews glares over at them

JAKE ANDREWS
I had I had problems back then
when your mother left us You know
that
(shakes his head)
Airing our private business out in
front of strangers

Jesse lunges forward again but Clarence stops him with a palm
to his chest Clarence looks perturbed

CLARENCE
Stop We might need him

JESSE
For what He ain’t good for shit

CLARENCE
Your sister has the money to pay
off his debts or at least some of
them if that’s how she chooses to
spend it He didn’t know about it
We go to see Jonah we might need
him there to help arrange things

Jesse nods slowly

JESSE
That’s big thinkin’
(to Jake Andrews)
Come on you

Jake Andrews slowly gets to his feet muttering to himself

JAKE ANDREWS
Whatever boy Think you’re all
somethin’ just ‘cause you can beat
up on your old man now

EXT JONAH’S MANSION - EARLY EVENING - ONE HOUR LATER

Jesse drives the pick-up truck into the circle drive of
Jonah’s mansion Four other cars are already there including
the sheriff’s car and a large white SUV

Clarence Jesse and Skeeter climb out of the front of the
truck Creek helps Jake Andrews down out of the back

Skeeter removes a double barrel SHOTGUN from the rack in the
truck along with some bullets and checks to confirm that
it’s loaded He lights a cigarette letting it hang out of
the corner of his mouth

Jesse begins walking up towards the house His relatives
follow Jake Andrews lagging behind

CLARENCE
Wait Don’t you want to look around

JESSE

Why We know they’re inside right

then follows them
EXT JONAH’S MANSION - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Creek check the door

Creek closest to the doorknob reaches out and opens the
door slightly

CREEK
It’s unlocked

Jesse looks over at his father

JESSE
Get in there

JAKE ANDREWS
What But- Why me

JESSE
You’ve had dealings with the man
He’s more likely to expect you than
us You go first Get on in there

JAKE ANDREWS
Yeah but-

With a snarl of frustration Jesse grabs onto Jake Andrews by
his shirt He KICKS THE DOOR open and throws his father
through the open doorway

INT JONAH’S MANSION - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jake Andrews eyes wide staggers into the front room of
Jonah’s mansion

HIS BODY IS IMMEDIATELY HIT BY SEVERAL BULLETS Gunshots
explode all over the room and blood splatters from Jake
Andrews’ torso as he is shot repeatedly

EXT JONAH’S MANSION - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

The force of the gunshots knocks Jake Andrews’ corpse back
out through the open front door sliding to a stop on the
porch leaving a large RED SMEAR across the white paint

Jesse looks down at his father’s dead body He clenches his
jaw so that the muscles in his face bulge

JESSE
Yep Creek go get the side mirror
from the truck

Creek nods and hurries away Clarence is watching all of this
with calm interest

Creek runs over to the passenger side of Jesse’s pick-up
truck and takes hold of the side rearview mirror He detaches
it from the side of the truck then runs back up to the porch
with the mirror

Creek tosses the mirror to Jesse taking cover to one side of
the open door Jesse holds the mirror out into the doorway
and angles it so that he can see inside the house

Visible in the mirror’s reflection are TWO LARGE MEN hiding
behind a couch with GUNS facing the doorway Another man is
crouched on the stairs above them

A moment later the mirror SHATTERS with a GUNSHOT flying
out of Jesse’s hand Jesse sits back shaking his hand
lightly

JESSE (CONTD)

Hmm I don’t know these fellas
Looks like he called in some
reinforcements pros brought ‘em
in from Kansas City probably He’s
got the contacts

(to Clarence)
All ‘cause of you

Clarence shrugs Jonah’s voice calls out from inside

JONAH (0S)
You think I wouldn’t see you
comin’ boy Was worried wed have
to come gunnin’ for you but you
came to us with your sorry
jibbhead crew You killed my man in
cold blood and by God youll pay
for that

Clarence waves at Jesse then points to a small SECURITY
CAMERA positioned behind him at the end of the porch on the
ceiling It is barely visible in the darkness facing them

JESSE
Well that explains it

Jesse reaches over and takes Skeeter’s shotgun from him He
gives the camera the FINGER then lifts the shotgun and BLOWS
IT OFF THE CEILING

JONAH (0S)
Aw Youll fucking pay for that
too

JESSE
Skeeter

Skeeter nods and takes a STICK OF DYNAMITE from his back
pocket Clarence’s eyes widen

Holding the fuse to the glowing end of the cigarette in his
mouth Skeeter LIGHTS IT then holds the sparking stick of
dynamite in his hand frowning at it as the fuse burns down

CLARENCE
Um

Just as the fuse has nearly burned down to the stick of
dynamite Skeeter moves swiftly and throws it into the
doorway of Jonah’s house

A moment later a scream comes from inside

SHERIFF CONRAD (0S)
Look out That’s-

The rest is drowned out by the EXPLOSION The windows on
either side of the doorway SHATTER OUTWARDS Clarence and the
Andrews brothers hunch down as the broken glass flies past
them

JESSE
Now Get ‘em

Jesse Skeeter and Creek rush inside guns drawn Clarence
starts to follow them then stops remaining outside

INT JONAH’S MANSION - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The inside of the mansion is filled with smoke from the
explosion Jesse Skeeter and Creek move into the cloud

The man who was positioned up on the stairs is visible
slumped against the railing COUGHING Bits of DEBRIS rain
down from the ceiling Above them the glass chandelier
sways CREAKING fragments of it dropping around the three
brothers

Creek lifts his gun and SHOOTS the man on the stairs who
pitches forward his blood dripping down the railing

The sofa positioned with its back facing the doorway has been
partially DESTROYED its innards exposed The two large men
that were hiding behind it suddenly both RISE UP remaining
crouched behind the sofa as cover They are both clearly
wounded from the blast their ears bleeding

The two wounded men OPEN FIRE on the three brothers who
without taking cover fire back CREEK IS SHOT in the
shoulder spinning him around then the HEAD as he falls to
the marble floor DEAD

Jesse and Skeeter continue firing upon the two men behind the
sofa SKEETER fires one barrel of his shotgun into the back
of the sofa the blast penetrates clear through sending one
of the wounded men FLYING BACK with a hole in his torso

Jesse shoots the other wounded man in the forehead as he
rises up to return fire

Both of the men behind the sofa are dead Jesse and Skeeter
hesitate in the sudden silence looking around Jesse glances
down at Creek’s body on the floor

JESSE
Creek dead

SKEETER
Yep

Muzzles flashes are abruptly visible in the smoke from the
hallway as SHOTS ARE FIRED Jesse is shot in the arm causing
him to stumble back

Skeeter lowers his shotgun in the direction of the hallway
Before he can fire another shot comes from the hallway and
Skeeter is shot in the chest He FIRES THE SHOTGUN as he
falls back the blast going up into the ceiling

JESSE
Shit

Jesse dives to the floor just as the GLASS CHANDELIER comes
CRASHING DOWN It lands directly on Skeeter crushing him and
splattering blood across the floor

Jesse slides across the smooth floor in the direction of the
hallway He comes to a stop only a few feet in front of
JONAH who is aiming a nickle-plated pistol down at Jesse’s
head Jonah is chewing on a toothpick

JONAH
Hey there Jesse

Jesse lying on his stomach can only see Jonah’s cowboy
boots He arches his neck to look up at Jonah’s face then
sighs

JESSE
Yeah Hey Jonah

Jonah spits out his toothpick and SHOOTS Jesse in the top of
his head Brains splatter out through the hole in Jesse’s
scalp His head falls back to the floor

Jonah looks around the completely destroyed smoldering front
room of his mansion

JONAH
Un-fucking-believable

Jonah turns around to face the sheriff and three other men
who are crouched in the hallway the sheriff leaning against
the wall on CRUTCHES his leg in a brace

The three other men are RAMSAY ELLIS and POOLE all large
all with the mildly disinterested demeanor of professionals

JONAH (CONTD)
Where’s the other one

RAMSAY
What other one

JONAH
The other one the evil fucker from
California I called you all out
here to protect me from He’s the
one we want Did he come in here

RAMSAY

SHERIFF CONRAD
If he’s smart he took off running
and we’ll have to search the roads

JONAH
Yeah And if he’s not he’s still
here on my goddamn property trying
something Either way get looking
for him And try not to kill him if
you can avoid it I want some
answers

SHERIFF CONRAD
(growling)
And I want to kill him with my own
two hands

RAMSAY
No promises That wasn’t an
original part of our contract

Jonah nods and the three professionals move from the hallway

INT JONAH’S MANSION - BASEMENT ROOM - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Clarence is downstairs making his way through a darkened
room the 50 caliber gun in his hand He has entered through
the back door of the house which is open behind him

The room is filled with boxes of electronic equipment
Clarence glances at some of this then continues moving

INT JONAH’S MANSION - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Clarence steps out into a hallway area A flight of stairs
leads up to a kitchen on the first floor

INT JONAH’S MANSION - BASEMENT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Clarence begins to go up the stairs then stops and crouches
down when a dark figure steps out into the stairwell above
him It is Ellis one of the professionals Jonah hired

Ellis aims his gun and FIRES at Clarence just as Clarence
leaps back down the stairs and rounds the corner back into
the hallway The bullet hits the side of the stairwell wall

INT JONAH’S MANSION - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Clarence stands with his back to the wall just out of view
from the stairwell his gun drawn catching his breath A
shout comes from the stairwell above him

ELLIS (0S)
He’s down in the basement Go
around the back I’ve got him
trapped down here

Clarence quickly looks around there is no exit available to
him other than the back door

CLARENCE
Shit

Clarence beginning running for the back door to the house

EXT JONAH’S MANSION - BACKYARD - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Clarence emerges from the rear of the house The CORNFIELD
MAZE is in front of him

Ramsay comes running around the side of the house his gun
held out in front of him Clarence seeing this flees
towards the maze

Ramsay FIRES HIS GUN at Clarence twice but as they are both
running is unable to hit him Clarence disappears into the
cornfield maze

Poole follows Ramsay running behind him from the front of
the house They both enter the maze together

EXT CORNFIELD MAZE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Moving into the maze Ramsay and Poole both stop running and
begin cautiously walking down the entrance path guns drawn
and remaining close the walls of corn on either side

They reach the first intersection Looking down Ramsay can
see FRESH FOOTPRINTS in the soil showing where Clarence ran
left at this intersection

Ramsay points at the prints and Poole nods They go left
rounding the corner Ramsay in the lead moving quietly

Immediately the SKELETON on a wire LEAPS OUT at Ramsay
CACKLING and swaying in front of him

RAMSAY
Jesus Christ

Ramsay startled lifts his gun in a swift motion and SHOOTS
THE SKELETON twice through its hollow ribcage

Immediately a third GUNSHOT comes from behind the skeleton
The shot hits Ramsay in the forehead and blows off the ENTIRE
TOP OF HIS HEAD leaving only his lower jaw intact Ramsay’s
corpse drops to the ground

Clarence is crouched on the ground behind the laughing
skeleton aiming the 50 caliber revolver Poole seeing
this immediately FIRES AT CLARENCE as he moves to the side

Poole’s bullet HITS CLARENCE in the side of his thigh
knocking his leg out from under him Clarence sprawls out on
his back with a CRY OF PAIN

Clarence immediately lifts his gun but stops the movement
when he sees Poole standing his gun already AIMED AT
CLARENCE’S CHEST

POOLE
Stop right there

Clarence is still

POOLE (CONTD)
Toss your gun over here

Clarence hesitates then tosses the gun a few feet towards
Poole where it lands on the dirt

POOLE (CONTD)
(calling out)
I’ve got him
(to Clarence)
(MORE)

POOLE (CONTD)
You don’t try anything funny now
You just lie there and bleed

Clarence does not respond A few moments later Ellis rounds
the corner followed by Jonah walking with his cane and the
sheriff who is sweating and struggling with his crutches

The skeleton begins rattling and LAUGHING again as they
approach

JONAH
That’s annoying

Jonah reaches up and turns off the skeleton by flicking a
switch on its back Clarence shifts into a seated position
facing them still covered by Poole’s gun

JONAH (CONTD)
Well Isn’t this pleasant

Jonah lifts his cane flips it and brings the metal handle
down on CLARENCE’S COLLARBONE just to the side of his head
Clarence gives a shout of pain and clutches the bruised area

Jonah swings the cane down on the other side of Clarence’s
collarbone hitting him again With a SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH
Clarence falls forward onto his hands holding himself up

Jonah STOMPS DOWN on the back of Clarence’s head pushing his
face down into the soil

JONAH (CONTD)
There That’s a start That your
gun there Conrad

SHERIFF CONRAD
Well I’11 be Would you mind
picking that up for me Poole

Poole lifts the 50 caliber revolver off the ground and hands
it to the sheriff who begins wiping it clean on his shirt

JONAH
See Things are looking up
(to Ellis)
Roll him over onto his back

Ellis moves over and KICKS CLARENCE in the WOUND on the side
of his leg With another YELL OF PAIN Clarence rolls away
onto his back but is stopped when Jonah places the wooden
heel of one boot on his forehead

Jonah looks down at Clarence who stares up at him

JONAH (CONTD)
Now I imagine you already know
some of the questions I’m going to
ask you right Such as where’s
Katie Jane Where did you take her

CLARENCE
You don’t have her

Keeping his boot planted against the top of Clarence’s head
Jonah swings his cane down like a golf club into the SIDE

OF CLARENCE’S FACE There is a wet sound of impact and blood
BUBBLES from between Clarence’s lips

JONAH
(to Sheriff Conrad)
Never was much for playing sports
myself All that runnin’ and
fussin’ Still I’ve always enjoyed
golf Now that’s a man’s game

The sheriff laughs tucking his large gun into his waistband
Jonah returns his attention to Clarence

JONAH (CONTD)
Well you failed that round Let’s
see how you do with round two
Before you killed Michael and stole
the girl you were talking about
some money Tell me about that

CLARENCE
How did you-

JONAH
(interrupting)

I’ve got the whole house wired for
sound You never know when that
might come in handy especially in
keeping local officials in line
But I’m asking the questions The
money you mentioned What money

Clarence hesitates Jonah lifts his cane again and again
SWINGS THE HANDLE DOWN into the side of Clarence’s face

Clarence chokes coughing out blood then spits out TWO
TEETH both side molars Jonah scowls down at him

JONAH (CONTD)
Goddammit Are you going to make me
get a workout here

Jonah lifts the cane again Clarence speaks thickly his
mouth full of blood

CLARENCE
Katie Jane She took some money
that belongs to my company I was
sent here to get it back

JONAH
Uh huh How much we talking here

CLARENCE
Thirty thousand In cash

Jonah slowly lowers this cane looking at the sheriff

SHERIFF CONRAD
Thirty grand could go a way towards
repairing your front room

JONAH

Ah don’t even get me started on
that Only thing’s gonna make me
feel better about that is hearing
this boy here beg us to kill him
after spending a few hours working
on him with a pair of pliers
Still

(to Clarence)
I bet you can guess what I’m going
to ask now though right

CLARENCE
The money’s back at the brothers’
house Katie Jane’s brothers She
and I hid it there in a place even
they won’t know to look for it

JONAH
Ah hah She there too

Clarence hesitates just a moment

CLARENCE
No But I know where she is

JONAH
And where’s that

CLARENCE
I put her up in a hotel a couple of
towns over in Otley She’s waiting
for me there

Jonah nods thinking He removes his boot from Clarence’s
forehead

JONAH
Well first things first Let’s go
get that money

Jonah nods at Ellis and Poole who reach down and roughly
haul Clarence to his feet They march him out of the maze
between them

INT JONAH’S SUV - EVENING - MINUTES LATER

Ellis is driving the white SUV that was parked in Jonah’s
driveway Jonah is seated in the passenger seat

Clarence is sitting in the backseat between the sheriff and
Poole The sheriff leans over and points to the bullet wound
on Clarence’s leg

SHERIFF CONRAD
Hey son That hurt

Clarence just looks at him The sheriff jabs his finger into
the wound twisting his finger into Clarence’s flesh
Clarence grits his teeth and squirms

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
How about now

The sheriff sits back laughing then wipes his bloody finger
clean on the sleeve of Clarence’s shirt

EXT METH HOUSE - LATE EVENING - ONE HOUR LATER

Ellis pulls the SUV into the dirt driveway of the Andrews
brothers’ meth house They all climb out of the SUV Poole
pulling Clarence out by one arm

The sheriff makes his way up to the front door on his
crutches Jonah follows him

JONAH
Christ what a shithole

The sheriff leans on one crutch and shoves Clarence forward
towards the front door

SHERIFF CONRAD
Make him go in first Could be some
sort of trap

Clarence turns and glares back at the sheriff The sheriff
moves forward on his crutches after him

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
What

Clarence reaches for the doorknob to the front door and turns
it it is unlocked

Clarence hesitates then throws open the door and LEAPS
INSIDE rolling into a SOMERSAULT out of view The sheriff
lurches forward into the house after him

SHERIFF CONRAD (CONT’D)
Goddammit He’s getting-

As the door opens the BEAR TRAP on the ceiling SWINGS DOWN
moving harmlessly above Clarence and HITS THE SHERIFF FULL
IN THE FACE Its tab depressing the JAWS CLAMP DOWN ON HIS
HEAD the teeth digging into his scalp and the soft flesh
beneath his chin

The sheriff’s SCREAM is muffled as his lower jaw is BROKEN
and CLAMPED SHUT by the bear trap He drops both of his
crutches but is held upright in the doorway by the trap on
the hinged board blood flowing out around his face and
splattering the floor His eyes roll around desperately
visible through the traps’s jaw

Poole and Ellis immediately try to get a shot at Clarence
but cannot aim past the sheriff’s trembling bulk which is
blocking the doorway

JONAH
Goddammit Get after him

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING —- CONTINUOUS

Clarence rolls out of his somersault landing on his
unwounded leg Cooter is standing in the doorway to the
dining room holding a double barrel shotgun cradled in his
thin arms

CLARENCE
Look Intruders Shoot them

At the doorway Ellis and Poole are squeezing past the
sheriff who makes MUFFLED HOWLS of protest as they shift him
around Cooter stares back at Clarence malevolently

COOTER
You kilt my dog

CLARENCE
Yeah but Listen Cooter that
was a long time ago Can’t we just-

Clarence ducks to one side as Cooter AIMS THE SHOTGUN at him
and pulls one of the triggers The blast hits the wall just
missing Clarence as he moves

Clarence finishes his leap by rolling away into the kitchen
out of Cooter’s view At the front door Ellis has squeezed
past the sheriff and has his gun out facing Cooter

ELLIS
Hey kid we’re on your side We-

Cooter turns and EMPTIES the second barrel of the shotgun
into ELLIS’ CHEST

The BLAST sends Ellis flying back into the wall just to the
side of the doorway where he crashes into the old wood
dead leaving a smear of blood on the broken boards

Cooter without changing his scowling expression breaks the
shotgun and begins reloading both barrels from a handful of
shells in one of his overall pockets facing the doorway

INT METH HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

The kitchen has been converted into a METH LAB various
baubles and cannisters linked together by rubber tubing on
the kitchen sink An iron skillet full of crystal residue
rests on a hot plate next to an old TOASTER

Across from the meth lab is a GAS STOVE and a small
refrigerator Clarence leans up against the stove looking
around for a weapon

Clarence grabs a dirty STEAK KNIFE out of the sink which is
filled with grey water then his eyes settle on a metal
cannister on the counter that is labeled “AMMONIUM SULFATE”

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING —- CONTINUOUS

As Cooter snaps his shotgun shut Poole moving in front of
the sheriff SHOOTS AT COOTER blasting a hole in the wall
just to the side of Cooter’s head

Cooter jerks to the side and fires at Poole who leaps away
Cooter’s shot instead HITS THE SHERIFF IN THE GUT blowing
out a chunk of flesh and KILLING HIM The sheriff’s limp body
continues hanging from the bear trap

As Poole rolls to the side Cooter fires at him again once
again MISSING His scowl increasing Cooter breaks open his
shotgun and again begins the process of reloading it without
taking cover

Poole rises to his feet frowning and SHOOTS COOTER TWICE in
the chest Cooter staggers back dropping his shotgun and
falls back on the sofa

Cooter slumps on the sofa blood spreading across the front
of his overalls then looks over to one side

Cooter is right next to the SHOTGUN WITH SYRINGES AND NAILS
poking out of its barrel which is strapped to a swivel hinge
and aimed at one of the windows with a white cord tied to
its trigger

Cooter reaches out turns the shotgun and pulls back on it
With a BLAST both BARRELS EXPLODES TOWARDS POOLE

Poole is instantly hit by a cloud of SHARP OBJECTS rusty
nails needles bits of wire and broken glass all stick into
his flesh

Poole is knocked back but remains on his feet hunched over
with pain resembling some sort of strange industrial
hedgehog His torso legs arms and face are all PIERCED by
various objects

POOLE
Fuck

Poole reaches down and pulls a rust-speckled UTILITY BLADE
out of his chest He looks up at Cooter who is still slumped
on the sofa SMILING at him

POOLE (CONTD)
You little fucker

Poole lifts his gun and SHOOTS COOTER AGAIN twice more in
the chest Cooter falls to one side DEAD

A broken syringe is sticking out of the side of Poole’s face
He yanks it out sending out a SPURT OF BLOOD and staggers
in front of the kitchen doorway

INT METH HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS
Clarence is standing just inside the kitchen He has lit one

of the burners on the gas stove and is holding the cannister
of ammonium sulfate in both hands

The cannister removed from its tubing is sending out a FINE
SPRAY of gas which Clarence aims away from him

As soon as Poole steps into the doorway Clarence SLAMS the
gas cannister down on the stove so that the spray from the
cannister is facing the open flame of the gas burner

The GAS IGNITES with a WHOOSH OF FLAMES Immediately the
CANNISTER FLIES OFF THE STOVE shooting through the air
through the kitchen doorway

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING —- CONTINUOUS

The ammonium sulfate cannister HITS POOLE SQUARE IN THE
CHEST knocking nails DEEPER INTO HIS FLESH and LIFTING HIM
UP OFF THE FLOOR as it sails through the air

Both Poole and the flaming cannister CRASH INTO THE FRONT
WINDOWS of the room

Immediately the SAW BLADE rigged above one of the windows
comes down on Poole HACKING OPEN THE SIDE OF HIS NECK and
partially decapitating him severing his spine Poole
crumples in the window frame DEAD pinned by the blade

The cannister hits the floor and SPINS until it lodges into a
corner of the room Flames shoot from it then it EXPLODES
sending bits of shrapnel flying across the room

INT METH HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Clarence hits the floor as the gas cannister explodes in the
front room Pieces of metal sail into the kitchen imbedding
themselves into the walls but nothing hits him

After a moment Clarence cautiously climbs to his feet and
steps into the front room

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING —- CONTINUOUS

The corner of the front room is burnt and smoldering The
entire area including the corpses of Ellis Poole Cooter
and the sheriff has been hit with shrapnel and singed The
sheriffs corpse is still hanging from the bear trap but he
is now missing part of one leg

JONAH (0S)
Anyone still alive in there

Jonah slowly squeezes past the sheriff’s body into the front
room a 22 pistol in one hand and his cane in the other He
stops when he sees Clarence

JONAH (CONTD)
Oh

Jonah lifts the pistol to aim at Clarence Clarence LAUNCHES
HIMSELF at Jonah with a SNARL

Jonah fires the bullet goes into CLARENCE’S SHOULDER The
next moment Clarence SMASHES INTO JONAH knocking him to the
floor Jonah drops his gun which skids across the floor

Clarence scrambles to his feet and kicks Jonah in the stomach
with his unwounded leg hard Jonah chokes curling up

Clarence reaches down and grabs Jonah’s CANE

JONAH (CONTD)
Wait

Clarence swings the metal handle of the cane down on the top
of Jonah’s head Jonah SCREAMS grabbing his head Clarence
brings the cane down again then again

CLARENCE
You fucking motherfucking
piece of shit

Blood SPATTERS the far wall as Clarence continues hitting
Jonah with the cane gradually CAVING IN HIS SKULL

The final swing of the cane makes a horrible WET CRUNCHING
SOUND Clarence releases the cane With its handle imbedded
in Jonah’s crushed skull the cane remains sticking upright
in front of Clarence

Clarence breathing heavily looks down at Jonah’s dead body
his shoulders heaving His back is to the front door

There is a LOUD BOOM of a gunshot and CLARENCE IS SHOT IN THE
BACK He spins around landing on the floor with his
shoulders slumped against the wall leaving a SMEAR OF BLOOD
on the wood behind him

With blurred vision Clarence sees KATIE JANE standing next
to the sheriff’s hanging corpse holding the sheriff’s
SMOKING REVOLVER

Katie Jane walks over to glance at Clarence who is breathing
shallowly and staring blearily up at her

KATIE JANE
Youre still alive Jeez you
really are tough Not so smart
maybe but gosh just in terms of
sheer meanness I couldn’t have
picked much better than you

Behind Katie Jane Derrick moves into the front room of the
house his head still bandaged His eyes widen at the sight
of all of the corpses within Katie Jane looks from him to
Clarence

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
Clarence you remember Derrick It
was him and a couple of his old
football buddies that broke in on
us at the hotel He told them he
was rescuing me from an abusive ex-
boyfriend I’d picked up in
California Like I’d told him to

Derrick moves up next to Katie Jane and puts an arm
protectively around her looking anxious She leans against
him smiling Clarence’s eyes move from one to the other

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
Yeah me and Derrick go back all
the way to sophomore year though
we had to keep our seeing each
other a secret as my Pops didn’t
like me going out with fellas He
was like you not so smart Though
it was bright of you to lead Jonah
and them back here I was hoping
youd try that after I saw you
leave with Jesse and the boys

Katie Jane walks into the kitchen leaving Derrick standing
in front of Clarence

INT METH HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Katie Jane lifts the top off the gas stove and BLOWS OUT BOTH
OF THE PILOT LIGHTS She then puts the top of the stove back

on and switches on all the burners The HISSING OF GAS fills

the room

Katie Jane calls out still addressing Clarence

KATIE JANE
Have you ever seen a meth lab
explode It happens all the time
(MORE )

KATIE JANE (CONTD)
Half the stuff tweakers use isn’t
just flammable it’s explosive Red
phosphorus Boy

Katie Jane lifts another cannister of ammonium sulfate and
sets it on top of the stove unscrewing the cap so that more
gas hisses out She then moves back into the living room

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS
Katie Jane walks up to stand next to Derrick

KATIE JANE
We need to let it fill up with gas
for a bit

Derrick nods On the floor Clarence is trying to speak

CLARENCE
Wh Why

KATIE JANE
Why Is that what you’re asking I
told you Clarence I’m going to be
famous I’m going to be a star
This will start that And second
well you met my family My father
and all of them

Katie Jane hesitates and when she speaks again her voice is
harsh with disgust

KATIE JANE (CONTD)

Can you imagine what they’d have
done when I got out of here and
got real money Can you imagine me
trying to start a new life with
them still leeching off me or
trying to sell their sick stories
to the tabloids

(pauses lost in thought)
And beyond all that I just wanted
them dead

Katie Jane walks back into the kitchen

INT METH HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Katie Jane lifts a soiled paper napkin up off the counter and
wedges it down into one of the slots of the TOASTER She then
depresses the toaster’s lever turning it on

Electric coils within the toaster begin to glow ORANGE around
the paper napkin as the toaster heats up

INT METH HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING —- CONTINUOUS

Katie Jane walks back in front of Clarence Behind her
Derrick hovers near the front door nervously looking into
the kitchen

DERRICK
Come on let’s get out of here

KATIE JANE
Just a second

Katie Jane aims the giant handgun down at Clarence Clarence
unable to move just looks back up at her His voice is
barely audible

CLARENCE
No Please

KATIE JANE
Oh Clarence You couldn’t have
really thought that I liked you
did you Look at you Clarence
Look at you You’re scum

Katie Jane PULLS THE TRIGGER The bullet hits Clarence in the
chest blood splashing out onto his shirt He slumps back
still his eyes closed

Katie Jane looks down at Clarence for a long moment Derrick
is still standing near the front door watching this

DERRICK
Come on KJ We should go

Katie Jane grimaces looking over her shoulder

KATIE JANE
No Derrick You stay

Katie Jane turns and SHOOTS DERRICK IN THE HEAD The impact
of the shot causes his bandaged head to EXPLODE spraying
blood and brains everywhere His headless corpse drops to the
floor near the front door

Walking forward Katie Jane wipes the gun clean on her shirt
then using the bottom of her shirt to hold it presses it
against the palm of the sheriff’s dead hand a couple of
times She then lets the gun fall to the floor

Katie Jane gives the inside of the corpse-filled room one
last look then squeezes past the sheriff and exits the
house

A few moments later there is the sound of a CAR STARTING
outside and then the sound of Katie Jane driving away

On the floor Clarence is still then he suddenly coughs and
SUCKS IN A BREATH coughing again

Still lying on the floor Clarence tears open his bloody
dress shirt revealing the BULLETPROOF VEST he stole from the
sheriffs car strapped tightly beneath it

Clarence feels at the hole the 50 caliber bullet punched
through the vest BLOOD IS FLOWING through the hole but the
wound does not seem to be deep

With great effort and in obvious pain Clarence RISES TO HIS
FEET He staggers towards the front door

EXT METH HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Exiting in the house Clarence GASPS for breath sucking in
clean air The front yard of the house is dark and empty
except for Jonah’s SUV in the driveway The moon is visible
in the sky overhead

Clarence stumbles forward towards the dirt road Just as he
reaches it the house behind him EXPLODES

The blast knocks Clarence forward onto his face Flames
shoot from the windows of the house as a giant FIREBALL
expands within then the house BEGINS TO BURN

Clarence very slowly rises to his feet and begins limping
down the dirt road

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The red sedan that Clarence stole is exactly where he left
it on the side of the road around the bend from the burning
meth house

Clarence staggers over to the car opens the driver’s side
door then falls into the driver’s seat

INT RED SEDAN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Seated in the driver’s seat Clarence breaths for a moment
then begins unstrapping the bulletproof vest

With a groan of agony Clarence strips off the vest There is
a large wound on his chest where Katie Jane shot him and a
smaller wound on his shoulder where he was shot by Jonah His
back is also bleeding

Clarence reaches into the wound on his chest and gritting
his teeth pulls out a FLATTENED 50 CALIBER BULLET that is
embedded in the muscle It is completely flat like a coin
Fresh blood flows from the wound Wheezing Clarence tosses
the bullet onto the floor of the car then STARTS THE CAR
again with the exposed ignition wires

Clarence pulls the car out onto the dirt road turns it
around and begins driving away

EXT COLORADO HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

Clarence drives the red sedan down a Colorado highway The
sun is beginning to rise on the horizon filling the sky with

pale light

Clarence pulls the car into a large gas station

INT GAS STATION - EARLY MORNING - MINUTES LATER

Wearing a dark dress shirt Clarence approaches a bored clerk
behind the cash register The clerk’s name tag reads ERIC

Clarence’s arms are filled with boxes of bandages and bottles
of rubbing alcohol He has obviously made an effort to clean
himself up but his face is still swollen and dark with
bruises

Clarence sets the bandages and other goods down on the
counter The clerk looks up at him then reacts with shock at
Clarence’s face

ERIC
Jeez Louise What the heck happened
to you mister

CLARENCE
I got into a car accident Do you
have any iodine

ERIC
No I don’t think we do I’m sorry

CLARENCE
That’s fine This will do then
And whatever’s on pump two

Clarence pulls out his small roll of cash and pays the clerk
who begins bagging up his goods

EXT COLORADO REST AREA - MORNING

Clarence sits in the front seat of the red sedan which is
parked at a nearly deserted rest stop next to the interstate
Clarence appears to be wearing no shirt or pants

Clarence unscrews the bottle of alcohol and pours it out onto
his leg then splashes some more onto the wounds on his chest
and shoulder His SCREAMS OF PAIN are barely audible from
outside the car

INT NEVADA GAS STATION - LATE EVENING

Clarence limps inside a gas station that appears to be on the
outskirts of an urban area Two quarter slot machines are
next to the door Clarence approaches the counter sliding a
folded bill over to a skinny woman behind the register

CLARENCE
Pump six

SKINNY CLERK
Mister you look like you’ve-

CLARENCE
(interrupting)
Car accident

SKINNY CLERK
Ah hah

She points at Clarence’s shoulder handing him his change

SKINNY CLERK (CONT’D)
You know you’re bleeding through
your shirt there

Clarence looks down at his shoulder where a dark blotch of
RED BLOOD has begun soaking through his light shirt

CLARENCE
Yeah um

Looking past his shoulder Clarence sees a stack of USA Today-
style newspapers piled in front of the counter

On the cover is a color picture of Katie Jane standing next
to a police lieutenant in front of a podium with several
microphones

She looks distraught but beautiful her hair and make-up
immaculate The headline reads “SURVIVOR OF KANSAS MASSACRE
SPEAKS”

Clarence quickly grabs the top copy of this newspaper
looking it over Beneath the headline a subheading reads
“High school beauty queen watched as her entire family was
slaughtered by crime gang”

SKINNY CLERK
Yeah that’s pretty wild huh
She’s all over the news it’s all
they’re talkin’ ‘bout Wouldn’t be
such a big story if she wasn’t such
a looker I reckon You wanna buy
that

CLARENCE
Yes

Clarence slides a dollar over to the clerk and walks out with
the paper

EXT NEVADA GAS STATION - LATE EVENING - MINUTES LATER

The newspaper is spread out on the passenger seat opened to
the second and third pages of the front section where the
front page article continues Next to a senior year glamour
shot of Katie Jane a bold quote reads “Innocent Girl
Kidnapped By Pornographers”

There is a also a photo of the burnt meth house with
emergency personnel in hazardous materials suits carrying out
covered bodies on stretchers next to the heading “War
Escalated Between Gangs - Twelve Bodies Found In Two Houses”

Clarence scowls down at the paper then reaches for his
luggage in the backseat pulling out a dark dress shirt

As Clarence moves the shirt his VIDEO CAMERA is revealed
beneath it packed in with the rest of his clothing

Clarence looks down at the camera

FADE TO

Clarence walks down a sunny sidewalk in Canoga Park His
bruises and cuts all appear to have healed but he still
walks with a slight limp

Clarence reaches the door to the Abraxus Management office
building and steps inside

INT ABRAXUS MANAGEMENT OFFICE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

A television screen shows an image of Katie Jane
flatteringly lit in an interview chair on what appears to be
an entertainment news program She is facing an INTERVIEWER
who is shown in profile

INTERVIEWER (ON MONITOR)
I have to say I think it’s just
amazing how you’ve managed to
overcome this tragedy It’s really
an inspiration to us all in these
troubled times

KATIE JANE (ON MONITOR)
Thank you That’s very kind of you
to say

INTERVIEWER (ON MONITOR)
I guess the only question that
remains is what’s next for you
Beyond being the new face of Ogami
Cosmetics in North America do you
have anything else planned for the
future

KATIE JANE (ON MONITOR)
Actually I’m glad you asked I’ve
been putting together a new series

I’ve just moved to Los Angeles and
am starting a career as an actress
and I’ve had a film crew following
me around and documenting most of
that It should be interesting

INTERVIEWER (ON MONITOR)
Well I know I’1l be sure to tune
in Katie Jane thank you so much
for your time

KATIE JANE (ON MONITOR)
Thank-

The monitor goes dark cutting off Katie Jane’s response
Louie T is visible in the reflection on the dark screen He
is sitting at his desk Clarence seated across from him

LOUIE T
That’s it That was on last night
Can you imagine how much they paid
her for that exclusive interview
just to promote her new show

CLARENCE
No How much

LOUIE T
Well I don’t know the exact
figure But it had to be a few
hundred grand

Clarence does not seem too impressed by this

CLARENCE
And so far she’s kept Abraxus out
of it

LOUIE T

Not a peep Of course you being
alive and all

(shrugs)
Smartest move on her part She’s
not gonna say nothing and she
knows we damn well don’t want to
get caught up in it What a fucking
mess

CLARENCE
And Justin’s body

LOUIE T
Nothing Kept waiting to get a call

vanished off the face of the earth
Probably buried in a ditch
somewhere the poor bastard

CLARENCE
Yeah

Clarence lost in thought stares off into space

LOUIE T
How about you You’re looking
better you’re not all stumbling
around like a goddamn Frankenstein
monster anymore

(MORE)

LOUIE T (CONTD)
You ready to come back and work off
some of your fucking debt yet

CLARENCE
No I don’t think so But I wanted
to show you something

Clarence rises to his feet with a little difficulty and hands
Louie T a DVD-R

LOUIE T
What’s this

Clarence gestures at the television on Louie T’s desk
sitting back down in his chair

Louie T shrugs and inserts the DVD-R into a DVD slot built
into the monitor He lefts a remote control and presses a
button

Immediately an image of Katie Jane appears on the screen She
is taking off her clothes back in the hotel room in Great
Bend looking directly into the camera

KATIE JANE (ON MONITOR)
Can you see me

CLARENCE (0S ON MONITOR)
Yes What are you doing

KATIE JANE (ON MONITOR)
Shhh How do I look

Louie T’s jaw is agape as he stares at the television
screen

LOUIE T
Oh my God Clarence Tell me she

Louie T trails off his attention focused on the screen
Clarence watches the screen for a moment grimacing
uncomfortably then looks away from it The sound of he and

Katie Jane copulating comes from the monitor speakers

KATIE JANE (0S)(ON MONITOR)
Oh Clarence Yes

CLARENCE
Turn it off

LOUIE T
What

CLARENCE
Turn it off You get the idea

Louie T reluctantly stops the DVD player

LOUIE T
Jesus if that was me I couldn’t
stop myself from watching it

Louie T takes the DVD-R out of the player and turns to face
Clarence a wide grin on his face

LOUIE T (CONTD)
Clarence Clarence This is fucking

Louie T looks at the DVD-R in his hand then back at
Clarence

LOUIE T

Clarence is staring at Louie T his face serious

LOUIE T (CONTD)
Alright alright

Louie T hands the DVD-R back to Clarence who slips it into
his blazer pocket

CLARENCE
I already met with both Wicked and
VCA They each offered me a flat
million for the rights Obviously

youre in a better position to
handle the whole media reaction
element but I wanted to feel out
the market

Clarence rises to his feet

CLARENCE (CONTD)
It’s yours for a million then you
can do whatever you want with it

lawyer this afternoon to work out
the details

Louie T is staring at Clarence in shock

LOUIE T
Clarence Come on a million
dollars Listen we can work out a
deal on this I mean what the fuck

dollars

Clarence walking towards the door stops and turns back
towards Louie T

CLARENCE
Something else

Clarence exits Louie T’s office letting the door shut
behind him
EXT ABRAXUS MANAGEMENT OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Clarence exits the office building limping back out onto the
sidewalk He begins walking down the busy street

As Clarence reaches the end of the block he passes under a
billboard that shows a close-up shot of Katie Jane’s face
Her lips are parted suggestively a tube of red lipstick held
to her bottom lip The billboard bears the slogan “OGAMI -
TRUE BEAUTY”

Clarence rounds the corner and disappears from view

FADE OUT
