closer to GWEN’S face as she listens to what’s being said

that seam and they would recognise
it There’s no other coal like it
It’s perfect Pure

Weve let you down (There are
shouts of reproval) We have We
haven’t collected enough We
haven’t raised enough awareness -

always be defending sometimes you
have to attack - to push forward
And that’s exactly what we’re going
to do When we get back to London -
and you have my word on this - we
are going to - (looks at MIKE) - do
something so spectacular (laughter
growing) Alright I’m not exactly
sure what - but it’ll be so
incredible so effective that the

this - will come crawling on their
hands and knees in full drag to

beg you for forgiveness
(Uproar of laughter and
applause from the hall)

Cheering from everyone HEFINA smiles at JOE beside her hugs
him One of the MINERS’ WIVES starts to sing from her seat
her voice breaking through the cheers

MINERS WIFE
As we come marching marching in
the beauty of the day
A million darkened kitchens a
thousand mill lofts gray
Are touched with all the radiance
that a sudden sun discloses
For the people hear us singing
Bread and roses Bread and roses

Others join in

As we come marching marching we
battle too for men

For they are womens children and
we mother them again

Our lives shall not be sweated from
birth until life closes

Hearts starve as well as bodies
give us bread but give us roses

People put their arms around each other CLIFF nods along to
the melody MIKE JONATHAN STEPH etc are totally absorbed
DAI DONOVAN is standing beside MARK He looks across the room
to MARGARET She looks back at him tired worn-down but
loving There’s a whole history in that exchanged look

As we come marching marching
unnumbered women dead

Go crying through our singing their
ancient cry for bread

GETHIN very moved begins mouthing along JONATHAN watches

Small art and love and beauty their
drudging spirits knew

Yes it is bread we fight for --
but we fight for roses too

They look over Buses Row after row of buses We hear the
hiss of the pneumatic doors and see the boots and shoes of
miners and their families getting off A Union man reels off
the lodge names as they arrive-

UNION MAN
Haverfordwest Caerphilly West
Glamorgan East Glamorgan

MINERS are mingling with LGSM Shaking hands One of the
MINERS getting off the bus is JOHNNY He walks over to a Drag
Queen and shakes her hand Now we see a big colliery band
Full uniform Tuba trombone trumpet all shining in the
sunlight as they are unpacked from the buses The list
continues -

UNION MAN (0S) (CONT’D)
Brockwell Harvey Durham

POLICEMEN now putting their helmets on as they run All
looking rather nervous A group of MINERS unfurl a banner
MINERS SUPPORT GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS There are lodge
banners too Huge beautiful Union banners which are being
expertly assemb ed laid out on the grass The TV crew has
appeared They’re interviewing CLIFF

CLIFF
The gays and the lesbians have been
magnificent There’s no other word
or it -

TV WOMAN
You must have found it a bit weird
A load of gays and lesbians
descending on you like that

CLIFF
(Dry dignified)
Why on earth would we find that
weird

The TV WOMAN shrivels Still smiling A lodge banner is
hoisted triumphantly up on poles from the grass

GAYS and LESBIANS have been standing around watching MARK is
herding LGSM and their now huge MINERS support group up to
the front

MARK
Come on we’re up the front This
way - This way -
As they set off the GAYS and LESBIANS watching start to
applaud The MINERS wave Some applaud back

EXT GAY PRIDE PROTEST MARCH DAY 202

We see the head of the march now JOE is standing next to
MIKE and MARK SIAN DAI MARTIN HEFINA GWEN and CLIFF are
there too STEPH as well - everyone All together

MIKE
(To JOE)
You’re not worried about being too
visible this time
We spin round to see a huge bank of press photographers
JOE
(To MIKE)
Shut up and march

The band strikes up The march begins

EXT GAY PRIDE PROTEST MARCH DAY 203

We follow them marching The skinheads - all getting ready to
cause trouble are suddenly a lot more reticent than last
time Some of the MINERS are walking with STELLA and ZOE and
singing ‘Every Woman is a Lesbian at heart’ LGSM and the
DULAIS villagers are marching with their arms round each
other children on JEFF’S shoulders etc Cards on screen

On June 29th 1985 London’s Gay Pride March was led by
members of the Dulais community other miners and official
representatives of the Mine worker’s union in a show of
thanks and solidarity for LGSM’s overwhelming support during
the miner’s strike

CLIFF walks through the crowd looking around him in wonder
at the other gay people there After a moment he slows down
so that he starts to lose the villagers slightly and can take
in the spectacle on his own A banner passes him GAY POETRY
AND LITERATURE SOCIETY He smiles Now we focus on SIAN
marching along A card reads

Sian James enrolled at Swansea University as a mature student
graduating after three years with a degree from the Welsh
Language Department

As the march passes Parliament SIAN leads a furious barrage
of shouts and whistles - shaking her fist at the building

In 2005 she was elected Member of Parliament for Swansea
East The first woman ever to serve that constituency

As SIAN moves ahead we see AIDS activism and remembrance
banners - one particularly which reads - Those we have lost
JONATHAN and GETHIN come into view behind Holding hands

Jonathan Blake was the second person ever to be diagnosed HIV
positive in the UK

He smiles and waves as he marches along GETHIN kisses him on
the cheek

He recently celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday

We pass through other members of LGSM RAY and REGGIE JEFF
STEPH - All of them surrounded by villagers from Dulais
JEFF is flanked with children and is carrying RHODRI on his
shoulders Finally we reach MARK He’s having a ball
Bellowing through his loud-hailer A couple of MINERS sweep
him up onto their shoulders He raises his hands in the air
grinning broadly from ear to ear

Mark Ashton continued to work tirelessly for political and
civil rights causes

He looks young and beautiful against the blue sky He shields
his eyes against the sun Laughs

He died on February 11 1987 just one week after his
diagnosis with HIV AIDS

The MINERS pull him back down now and he is enveloped by his
friends Hugging laughing

He was 27 We sweep over their heads and see the full reach
of the marchers the banners sail past Another card

In September 1985 at the Labour Party Conference a motion
was tabled to enshrine Gay and Lesbian rights into the
party’s official manifesto Although the motion had been
raised many times before this time it was carried without
objection

The banners sail by This was due in no small part to a
block vote of total approval from the largest Union at the
conference

Then - The National Union of Mineworkers

As the music reaches its climax the final banner passes
through It’s the special DULAIS banner that DAI first
described to MARK on a welsh hillside It’s a very old
banner A crude but lovingly appliquéed symbol in white
against a red background It too fills the screen Two hands
joined in friendship

FADE TO BLACK
