TO ROME WITH LOVE
Synopsis

TO ROME WITH LOVE is a kaleidoscopic comedy movie set in one of the world’s most
enchanting cities The film brings us into contact with a well-known American architect reliving
his youth an average middle-class Roman who suddenly finds himself Rome’s biggest celebrity
a young provincial couple drawn into separate romantic encounters and an American opera

director endeavoring to put a singing mortician on stage

Well-known architect John (Alec Baldwin) is vacationing in Rome where he once lived in his
youth Walking in his former neighborhood he encounters Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) a young man
not unlike himself As he watches Jack fall head-over-heels for Monica (Ellen Page) his
girlfriend Sally’s (Greta Gerwig) dazzling and flirtatious friend John relives one of the most

romantically painful episodes of his own life

At the same moment retired opera director Jerry (Woody Allen) flies to Rome with his wife
Phyllis (Judy Davis) to meet their daughter Hayley’s (Alison Pill) Italian fiancée Michelangelo
(Flavio Parenti) Jerry is amazed to hear Michelangelo’s undertaker father Giancarlo (renowned
tenor Fabio Armiliato) singing arias worthy of La Scala while lathering up in the shower
Convinced that talent that prodigious cannot be kept hidden Jerry clutches at the opportunity to

promote Giancarlo and rejuvenate his own career

Leopoldo Pisanello (Roberto Benigni) on the other hand is an exceptionally boring guy who
wakes up one morning and finds himself one of the most famous men in Italy with many
unanswered questions Soon the paparazzi trail his every move and question his every
motivation As Leopoldo grows accustomed to the varied seductions of the limelight he

gradually realizes the cost of fame

Meanwhile Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) has arrived from the provinces in Rome hoping to
impress his straight-laced relatives with his lovely new wife Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) so

that he can get an upscale big city job Through comic misunderstanding and chance the couple
is separated for the day Antonio ends up passing off a stranger (Penélope Cruz) as his wife

while Milly is romanced by legendary movie star Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese)

While Rome is a city abundant with romance and comedy Woody Allen’s TO ROME WITH

LOVE is about people having adventures that will change their lives forever
TO ROME WITH LOVE
About the Production

Rome is a city like no other in the world To be in Rome is to be surrounded by the silent
monoliths of an ancient civilization while at the same time experiencing the clamor of a modern
metropolis teeming with life Rome is the perfect fusion of history and the present—an
exhilarating hub of extraordinary culture art and cuisine “So much of the action and activity in
Rome takes place outside in its cafés and streets” says Woody Allen “It’s an amazing city just
to walk in The city itself is a work of art” Rome is a city of very contemporary and
sophisticated people as well as people who are very traditional It attracts numerous visitors
from businessmen to tourists all of whom are passing in and out of Rome and enjoying its
delights For Allen it was a place that was too vast to be contained in a single plot “I felt the city
of Rome lent itself to a number of diverse tales” he says “It was pregnant with possibilities If
you stop a hundred Romans they’ll tell you ‘I’m from the city I know it well and I could give

you a million stories’”

Leopoldo Pisanello (Roberto Benigni) is an ordinary Roman who suddenly and inexplicably
finds himself to be one of the most talked about men in Rome “Leopoldo has no talent at all
he’s a common ordinary person” says Allen “he has no idea why he is being celebrated He is
quite aware that he is a nobody Leopoldo is at first totally bewildered and annoyed by all the
attention he’s getting and then starts — without even realizing—to like it” Says Benigni
“Leopoldo was happy and content before he was famous he had a harmony in his life But when
his harmony is upset he becomes completely discombobulated trying to understand what is
happening to him” Still there are telling cracks in Leopoldo’s seeming equilibrium before fame
taps him on the shoulder notably a moment where he longingly looks at a beautiful woman in
his office “He has no chance with a woman like that and he knows it” says Allen “Nobody
cares what he has to say about anything whether it’s the movies he sees or whether he thinks the
Chinese are taking over the world and certainly that kind of extraordinary woman is out of his
class until suddenly it all becomes possible” As paparazzi start trailing him Leopoldo soon
realizes that everything he desires is readily available to him “You do get seduced by fame”

says Allen “Not necessarily always corrupted Fame offers you a lot of opportunities that the
average person never gets a chance to experience So fame is a very seductive drug and it does
work on him” While Leopoldo enjoys the attention and the beautiful women who now throw
themselves at him he is also exasperated by other aspects associated with his sudden fame “You
give up your privacy you’re constantly hounded and everything you do is looked at under a
microscope” says Allen Roberto Benigni a true superstar in Italy is all too aware of what the
experience Leopoldo has is like “My dream is to walk in the street normally watching people
and having coffee having a pizza and talking with friends I lose a part of my life and I can’t do
that But if this didn’t happen anymore I’d be worried it’s a contradiction” Says Allen
“While there are many drawbacks to being well-known I would have to say the perks outweigh
the drawbacks You can live with all that because what you get for it are a great many positive

things”

On the flip side of Leopoldo is Giancarlo (renowned tenor Fabio Armiliato) a man who
possesses great talent and yet is completely anonymous A brilliant opera singer Giancarlo sings
only privately for his own enjoyment He has never tried it in public “One can never know what
stimulates an artist says Allen If the only place that Shakespeare can write is by sitting on a
bridge chair in the middle of 42 Street for whatever intangible reason that’s not something we

may ever be able to understand Giancarlo can only sing under very special circumstances”

On the face of it Giancarlo doesn’t seem to care about fame but meeting his future daughter-in-
law’s father Jerry (Woody Allen) changes everything A former opera director who is
unsatisfied with his retirement Jerry feels that he never really made his mark on the world “He’s
tried some avant-garde things but they didn’t work out and he’s never achieved the notoriety or
the acceptance he was looking for” says Allen “He’s frustrated and when he finally gets the
opportunity to possibly cash in on Giancarlo’s talent he grabs it” At first Jerry must overcome
the serious obstacle of Giancarlo’s leftist son—and his future son-in-law—Michelangelo (Flavio
Parenti) who is extremely hostile to the idea of his humble father being prodded by Jerry into the
world of public entertaining In his protectiveness Michelangelo doesn’t stop to consider his
father’s own wishes Says Allen “I think that when people have a real talent it demands

expression Sooner or later you want some communication of it I’m sure Giancarlo is the same
as anyone He wants someone to hear his voice and have that relational moment where he sings

and people are moved by it”

Another character in TO ROME WITH LOVE Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) while
possessing no special talent herself does get to meet a gifted actor Milly arrives in Rome from a
provincial town with her new husband Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) in search of a new life in the
big city Everything depends on the impression they make on Antonio’s wealthy relatives who
are in the position to give him a high-level job To look her best Milly sets out for a hairdresser
but gets hopelessly lost in the labyrinthine streets of Rome At the same time Antonio is
surprised in his hotel room by the appearance of Anna (Penélope Cruz) a voluptuous call girl
who mistakenly believes she has been hired to have sex with him Anna has been told that
Antonio is eccentric and will try to resist so she refuses to leave Protesting profusely Antonio
suddenly finds himself forced onto the bed and it is in this compromising position that his
relatives find him when they arrive at the hotel room The only explanation that Antonio can
come up with at the spur of the moment is that Anna is actually his wife Milly Taking pity on
him—and having been paid for the day—Anna agrees to go along with this story and the
relatives although astonished that Antonio has married this indecorous bombshell seem to
accept his ruse While Anna is willing to say she is Antonio’s wife this doesn’t mean she will
alter her behavior which sets the stage for many comic situations Says Cruz “Anna is a very
free spirit and she doesnt have a social filter in her mind so she says everything she feels without

ever worrying about the consequences”

Meanwhile as Milly is trying to find her way back to the hotel she encounters two movie stars
Pia Fusari (Ornella Muti) and her idol Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese) Milly is flabbergasted
when Salta offers to take her out to lunch and eventually to his hotel room “When a beautiful
young girl comes up to any movie star and says ‘I see all your movies and I’m crazy about you’
he would have a very good chance of taking that girl to bed because three-quarters of the work is
already done” says Allen When Antonio is out for lunch with Anna and his family he is
stunned to see Milly at another table being wooed by Salta which challenges his conception of
her as an innocent virginal girl Later at a party for the elite of Rome Antonio finds out that

Anna has a degree of notoriety albeit one lacking Luca Salta’s prestige Many of Rome’s top
businessmen seem to know her quite well and line up to make appointments Later while
taking a walk in the vast gardens during the party Anna questions Antonio about his marriage
She scoffs at his description of Milly as a “Madonna” intuiting that it is Antonio who is actually
the innocent one In her own unique way Anna helps Antonio move forward with a heightened
self-awareness “Anna takes her job very seriously and with a lot of dignity” says Cruz “She is

convinced that her services are therapeutic and that she does a great service to society”

While in Rome on holiday John (Alec Baldwin) a famous American architect explores the
neighborhood he lived in during his student days There he runs into a young architectural
student Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) who recognizes John from a newspaper photo and invites him
over to his apartment for coffee with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig) John soon realizes he
may have lived in the very same building as Jack Sally tells Jack that her actress friend Monica
(Ellen Page) has just broken up with her boyfriend and is coming to Rome for a change of
scenery Sally describes Monica as sensual brainy neurotic funny—a real man magnet Says
Gerwig “I think Sally is nervous about Monica but she thinks that if she just lays out all her
fears at the beginning—‘I want to say all the crazy things I’m worried about’—it will act almost
like a talisman and then nothing will happen” John warns Jack not to fall in love with Monica
“He probably knows that Jack will never listen” says Baldwin “but he can’t stop trying Jack is
on a course that may lead to disaster It’s like Jack is playing in traffic and John wants him to get
out of the road” Says Eisenberg “To have John giving him this practical but also jaded advice

only emboldens Jack It makes him even more passionate about pursuing Monica”

Of course there is also the element of John seeing Jack as himself as a young man in Rome and
Jack’s story is really John’s experience in the past seen now by John with the clarity of hindsight
and the understanding of how foolish he was once and how shallow and unworthy of his love

was Monica Still the attraction trumps logic

Monica loses no time living up to her reputation by dazzling Jack with the lurid details of her
wild and unconventional sex life as well as her seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of art
“Monica is free and has a kind of fluidity in the moment and I think that’s a very appealing thing

to people” says Page “Maybe it’s because we all want to feel free But ultimately people like
her don’t necessarily make great partners because there isn’t a lot of solidness” Says Allen
“You can’t corral people like Monica They’re too desirable and everybody wants them and they
learn that early on It’s very difficult to have a long-term stable relationship with that kind of
person” While John does everything he can to forewarn Jack the inevitable happens and he
succumbs to Monica’s charms “He’s in a youthful romantic bubble so of course he’s drawn to
her” says Eisenberg “She’s so self-involved and her self-involvement makes her so interesting
that when she shines her light anywhere near him he feels immediately and disproportionately

excited”

Throughout John hovers around Jack (but is John just watching himself as a youth) slipping in
and out of scenes commenting on Monica and Sally as if they weren’t there leaving the question
of what exactly is going on quite open This is something that Allen has done deliberately “You
can look at it two different ways” he says “but the safest way is that Alec takes a walk down
memory lane and he’s meeting his youth in spirit remembering what had gone on what his
feelings were the mistakes he made what the desperations were and having that as a memory
he never got over Jack is John’s youth without being young John in flashback” Says Page
“Different people will perceive it in different ways Maybe people who are older will look at it
through the perspective of John and maybe people who are younger will be more attached to the
immediacy of the interactions between Monica Jack and Sally and John will seem like an
outsider” No matter how one interprets the story the heart of it is about the wisdom of age
looking back at the callowness of youth Says Baldwin “In my opinion and from my
experience looking back at our younger selves at youth in general is alternately moving and
appalling We see younger people and think ‘I can’t believe I did that or said that’ But it’s part

of life to grow and change sometimes slowly sometimes more quickly”

Many of the characters in TO ROME WITH LOVE share a desire to be appreciated particularly
if they are relatively ordinary themselves This need is illustrated in Jerry and Leopoldo’s stories
but also in the strategy that Luca Salta employs to romance Milly he tells her that he values her
opinions on cultural matters an acknowledgement that her husband has never given her Jerry’s

son-in-law to-be Michelangelo keeps the subject of every conversation on himself and his
altruistic views which makes him feel special and important Likewise Jack’s self-esteem
swells when he believes that a woman with the sparkle of Monica would choose him as a lover
“Unavailable women are like catnip to some men particularly when they are younger” says
Baldwin “You don’t actually want them You just want to win the game It’s about ego” Page
thinks that Monica is also on a constant quest to be validated by the opinions of others “When
Monica is engaging with people she always has this air of striving to be the intellectual I
perceive that that might have something to do with her insecurity and her need to feel important

as in ‘Please like me I’m smart and I know this really good quote’”

This fundamental need in the human psyche to be acknowledged could be the basis of people’s
craving for fame “We live in a society where fame is this completely cherished and worshipped
thing” says Page “even though its constantly being revealed to us thats its typically not a
healthy lifestyle for people and it can even disintegrate them People pursue the idea that ‘this is
going to make me happy this is going to make me feel important this is going to make me feel
grounded and safe and powerful’ The irony is that the thing that people are expecting to fill
them is what ultimately makes them feel quite empty” Says Allen “People desire fame for the
same reason they pursue anything Everything we do whether it’s fame money pretty clothes
possessions artistic or athletic skill whatever it is what youre trying to do is attract a member

of the opposite sex as disguised as that may be in the actual action”

The stories found in TO ROME WITH LOVE explore the eternal quest for love and sex in its
many variations from a betrothal and a honeymoon through assorted acts of infidelity from
tender lovemaking to more spontaneous liaisons from the absurd and ridiculous to the poignant
and profound from the exhilaration of newfound love all the way to heartbreak and its aftermath
These romantic interludes play out simultaneously in this ancient and bustling city in every part
of town in the past and in the present They will carry on into the future Countless people have

found love on the streets of Rome—these are but a few
