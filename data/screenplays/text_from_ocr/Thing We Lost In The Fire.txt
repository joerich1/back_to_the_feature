THINGS WE LOST IN THE FIRE

by

Allan Loeb

DreamWorks
A GARAGE

stands alone Separated from the house Still in the night
Until

BLACK SMOKE

slowly billows up from the four-square pane of windows
More and more of it by the moment

The windows SHATTER outward and give way to FLAMES that crawl
up the outer wall A FIRE the fire

And as the fire consumes the garage

EXT HOTEL - NIGHT

It’s night A father and his son walk alongside of the large
pool that illuminates the grounds

The father BRIAN BURKE mid 30s displays all the signs of a
man settling into fatherhood benign smile expanding
midsection and aging wardrobe

His son DORY six years old owns big Jolly-rancher green
eyes a small nose puffy cheeks and a built-in innocence

The air is summer night They hold hands as they slowly walk
on a little bridge that crosses over the water

As Dory stops and points down to the pool

DORY
The water is green Daddy

Brian stops They stand on the bridge

BRIAN
No it’s florescent

DORY
What’s flor es cent

BRIAN
Florescent means lit from with-in

DORY
Am I florescent Daddy

And Brian regards his child Holds the moment
Knows it’s as fleeting as it is special
Dory swings back and forth waiting for the answer
Brian draws in a deep breath then

BRIAN
Yes Dory you are

As Dory smiles up toward his father

EXT HOTELPARKING LOT - DAY

Titles and music Brian and his wife Audrey pack up their
minivan Their daughter HARPER ten years old swings her
little brother around and around until Audrey tells them to
get into the minivan

Kids in the van luggage in the back Audrey finally faces
her husband and sighs He gives her a smile She returns it
by holding up the keys and dangling them

He grabs the keys and kisses her He’1ll drive so she can
sleep All told without a word

EXT SHOOTING GALLERYPARKING LOT - DAY

Titles and music continue A dirty parking lot behind a
boarded up building The ground is littered with beer cans
cigarette butts and needles

Find a body His name is DWAYNE was Dwayne He overdosed
about five minutes ago

A girl who calls herself SPRING in her twenties white-girl
dreads tattoos and pierces nods in and out on her third
opiate rush of the day

SPRING
Dwayne
(Louder )
Dwayne

No reaction She studies him Knows the score right away
Spring finds her feet and walks over to him Checks his pulse

Spring doesn’t cry or freak out or anything she simply reaches
into his pocket and removes six crumpled up dollar bills

A few junkies look over but they don’t do a thing

And before she goes Spring looks around the body looking
for something specific and she finds it

AN ENVELOPE
already opened with a big red stamp on it The stamp has a
caricature on it with the caption under it “Cream”

This is the brand of heroin they were just using

As Spring pockets the money the envelope and goes

EXT THE 5 FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

The minivan glides through the Washington landscape
Summer green and Northwest fresh

As the minivan races toward Seattle

INT MINIVAN - AFTERNOON

Music and titles continue Harper attempts to teach her
little brother a clapping rhyme

HARPER
Itsy bitsy let’s get busy up the
well and down the shoot climb the
tree

Dory is no good at this Clapping out of rhythm and screwing
up the words He simply breaks into laughter and gives up

Brian drives as Audrey plaintively looks out the open window
Brian regards her his wife of eleven years

AUDREY BURKE

As the heavy dusk-laden wind blows through her long and
flowing hair Thirty-six years old with an accessible beauty
that’s only further accentuated by her motherhood Not the
kind of beauty that threatens but the kind that invites
Childlike and giving

Audrey catches Brian admiring her and she smiles

And it’s a smile that explodes every time

INT SOUTH SEATTLE RECYCLING CENTER - NIGHT

Music and titles winding down We’re at weighs station for
homeless and addicts A center where they trade collected

cans for money Find

JERRY SUNBORNE
In his late thirties Jerry’s rail-thin with rock star hair
He’s very good looking -- heroin chic without the chic and
too much of the heroin

His eyes used to pierce with sensuality but they haven’t ina
long time dulled by the years of opiate abuse

Behind the counter Jerry hands a homeless woman a few bills
for her cans She smiles at him toothless and heads on her
way Jerry shouts across the center to his boss

JERRY
Ray I’m out

RAY
Alright Jerry take it slow

Music and titles die down as Jerry pulls away from the window
and heads on his way Spring catches his stride

SPRING
Dwayne OD’d

JERRY
When

SPRING

Like an hour ago
Jerry stops and faces her

JERRY
Is he dead

She confirms with a simple nod

JERRY
I told him to find me if he had any
problems

SPRING

Well he didn’t

And she hands Jerry the envelope

SPRING
And you’re not everyone’s father
Jer

JERRY

Were you with him

SPRING
No I found him after
As Jerry looks at the envelope

JERRY
Youre lying

She rolls her eyes as he tosses aside the envelope

JERRY
“Cream” Looks like Zoey’s

As they continue to walk

JERRY
Fuckin’ Dwayne

SPRING
Yeah

EXT SEATTLE’S MADISON PARK NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

An upper class neighborhood of Seattle with hills and views
of Lake Madison Brian pulls the minivan into the driveway
of a fantastic contemporary home made of wood and glass

He looks in the backseat where both kids are sleeping
Then looks over to Audrey who is also asleep He nudges her
She slowly wakes up and looks around

AUDREY
We home

Brian confirms and points to the kids She looks over her
shoulder at both of them sound asleep on each other

AUDREY
Don’t let them grow up

She looks to him with a smile

AUDREY
I’m going to make us pasta I’m
going find those cheesy bed trays
your sister gave us so we can eat
upstairs And we’ll open the wine
we just bought

She grabs his hand and looks into his eyes
AUDREY
And our vacation won’t end till

tomorrow

But he looks away Resolute
BRIAN
Ill clear the van when I get back

Losing her smile
AUDREY
Not now Brian We just got back

from vacation

BRIAN
I have to

In their quiet “kids are sleeping” voices

AUDREY
Why Why do you have to

BRIAN
Because it’s his birthday

Audrey leans forward now very upset Louder

AUDREY
You were just there

He looks at her An impasse Until
BRIAN
You should’ve seen him as a kid
Audrey I can’t explain it he was
special he was
It trails off
AUDREY
Everytime you go there I’m
terrified you won’t come back

And frustrated

BRIAN
Stop being so dramatic

AUDREY
Stop being so naive

She stews He stews In stalemate Until

BRIAN
It’s his birthday Audrey

Brian’s anger has now somehow risen
BRIAN
Who the hell knows how many more
he’s even going to have

As she shakes her head in an unhappy capitulation then turns
around to see both kids -- now wide awake

INT SOUTH SEATTLE APARTMENT - LATER

The Cream envelope is open on the table Spring’s out Asleep
on the couch with a syringe and a tie at her feet

Jerry watches an Anthony Robbin’s “Awake The Giant With-In”
infomercial Warm on Cream

A knock on the door Jerry doesn’t hear it Another knock
Louder Jerry snaps out of it and slowly rises

Jerry opens the door to see

BRIAN
Happy Birthday Buddy

Jerry gives him a hug Opens the door

JERRY
Is it August third Fuck

Brian heads in sees Spring asleep on the couch
Sees the syringe then quickly looks up to Jerry

BRIAN
Coffee

Clearly in the warmth of the opiate
JERRY
Yeah Cool
INT MINIVAN - NIGHT

Wearing his old tattered suit jacket Jerry gets in the
passengers seat and sees the junk in the back

BRIAN

holding Dory’s stuffed dinosaur
Jerry
Brian

Jerry

While

INT

Jerry

JERRY
Victoria Remember when we went up
there with your Dad

BRIAN

Dory insists he lives in the

JERRY
I’m Thirty-seven now I’m tired
Brian
staring into dinosaur’s plastic black eyes
JERRY
And I feel older than this guy
IZZYS DINER - NIGHT
drinks a coffee Jerry inhales an ice cream
JERRY

Audrey angry you came down to my
spot at night

BRIAN
No
smiles they both know it’s a lie
BRIAN

Yes I just don’t know why you
have always been so against seeing
her again

JERRY
I am not seeing anyone until I am
clean

BRIAN

She’d be crazy for you All women
are crazy for you

JERRY
We’re not fifteen anymore Brian

Anyway she doesn’t want to see me
(MORE )

sigh
JERRY
I provide nothing I am just a
poisonous threat

Brian accepts that But

BRIAN
That’s not true

And Jerry just smiles It is true and they both know it

JERRY
Look Brian you have to see her
point

BRIAN

You always take her side
As Jerry lights up a smoke

BRIAN
- and you do provide

JERRY
Name one thing

Brian thinks about it for a beat Then with a smile

BRIAN
Always taking her side

As Jerry sucks in a long draw then
JERRY
The Fed raised rates Is that
going to hurt you
BRIAN
No people will still buy this

refi boom’s got good legs

JERRY
Good

And Brian just looks at him Registering the question

INT QUICK STOP SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Brian wheels a little cart down the aisle of this no frills
mini-mart Jerry at his side

BRIAN
I appreciate this Audrey would
kill me if I didn’t grab this shit

JERRY
No worries

BRIAN
It’s just so hard to find the time
to get anything done With the
kids and the insurance from the
fire and we’re building an
office for me next to the garage
I’m not happy with the work I
think I might have to fire the
workers

Brian stops noticing his complaints are trivial And that
makes him a little embarrassed So he deflects it with

BRIAN
And Audrey’s fucking someone else

Jerry laughs

JERRY
Checking to see if I’m still
listening

BRIAN
No you haven’t seen her Theres
no way a woman that looks that good
could only fuck me

Jerry laughs even harder This is their game

BRIAN
Our neighbor Landon Hicks he’s
this really rugged mountain-man
type I don’t think he talks
(concluding)
She’s in love with Landon Hicks

JERRY
Youre probably right But you
know -- gotta take the good with
the bad -- at least you’re still in
the rotation

Brian agrees and now they’re both laughing

EXT SOUTH SEATTLE - NIGHT

As Brian and Jerry carry the grocery bags down the street

JERRY
It’s just like Senior year with
Emily Rotham She was the hottest
girl in school and she dug you

BRIAN
She dug you

JERRY
At first But after we all started
hanging out she got more
interested in you And she told me
then I told you and you didn’t
do anything about it

BRIAN
That was a long time ago

A SKETCHY CHARACTER takes an interest in them Brian’s a
little nervous Jerry’s not

JERRY

Don’t worry We’re fine
(and then)

I’m going to tell you now what I
told you then and I’ve been telling
you ever since Accept the good
because they’re going to make you
accept the bad

BRIAN
Okay I hear you

JERRY
Your wife loves you You know
that You have this amazing family
and the most incredible woman in
the world who loves you my man
You have everything any man would

want Accept the good You have

what I’1l never--

And it tails off

BRIAN
I know I know This is stupid
you don’t need to listen to this

JERRY
Fuck that I do need to listen to
this You’re my only real friend
left in the world do you know
that

Jerrys a little animated He’s very emotional as he’s
coming out from under the warmth of the opiate

JERRY
Theyre all gone Brian I know
it’s my own fault but they’re all
gone

And Jerry stops walking Turns to Brian Looks him straight
on

JERRY
You’re a success You’re an
amazing father and an amazing
husband

BRIAN
I hear you

JERRY
And I know you don’t have to come
out here at night to see me

BRIAN
Jerry--

JERRY
No let me finish I appreciate it
more than you know It’s the only
time in my day where it’s just
that well thank you
Jerrys holding back an emotional rush due to his inceptive

withdrawal If he doesn’t get high soon it’1l turn to
irritable then to sickness then to pure hell

INT JERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They stand at the doorway Brian readies to leave

BRIAN
Okay I’m off

A little hug

JERRY
Thanks for coming by bro

Brian breaks Looks at Jerry

BRIAN
Happy birthday

Jerry sharply looks away

JERRY
Oxymoron

And then back at Brian

JERRY
But I appreciate the sentiment

And Brian goes

Jerry heads to the couch and flops down on it
Packs a bowl lights up and draws

And as Jerry tokes he notices the grocery bags
everything Brian just bought at the store sitting against
the wall

Jerry can only shake his head and smile as he moves to the
window down to the street below where his best friend
jumps into a minivan and drives off

INT BURKE HOUSEBESIDE THE GARAGE - NIGHT

An empty space The lights turn on and Brian stands in the
doorway Looking over the room Some painting supplies
litter the center but most of the work is done

Brian steps in and takes a deep breath surveys the room

And he stands there for the longest of moments Still

INT BRIAN AND AUDREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Brian comes into the bedroom to find Audrey and Harper in the
bed watching television

BRIAN
It’s way past her bedtime

And they’re both crying
BRIAN
Oh no -- you’re not watching that

Lifetime movie again

HARPER
It’s this commercial we just saw

Beyond belief

BRIAN
Youre crying over a commercial

AUDREY
Do you know what they do to baby
seals in Alaska

HARPER
They were so cute Dad You have
to give them a lot of money

And Audrey looks up to him and holds up a written-on notepad

AUDREY
They have a website where we can
make a donation -- I wrote it down

Brian just rolls his eyes

BRIAN
Harper out

Harper kisses her mother good night then gets out the bed
As she passes her father

HARPER
Seal-hater

Audrey turns off the tv Brian gets ready for bed

AUDREY
How is he

BRIAN
He’s all fucked up Audrey
(and then)
They forgot to put dimmers on the
lights

AUDREY
What’s it matter

BRIAN
It’s important I told them I
wanted dimmers I’m firing them
and going with the Polish guys

He gets into bed turns off the lights Stares at the
ceiling She rolls over into his hold eyes now closed

AUDREY
Youre taking the kids swimming at
Howard’s tomorrow

BRIAN
Dory’s putting his head under

AUDREY
Don’t pressure him too much

Brian grunts in acknowledgement His mind elsewhere

A long silence she falls back asleep he can’t
He starts laughing she tussles awake
AUDREY
What
BRIAN
I told him you were fucking Landon
Hicks
AUDREY
Brian
BRIAN

I was kidding Don’t worry he
knows I was kidding

And now Audrey starts laughing

AUDREY
If I were sleeping with anyone it
sure as hell wouldn’t be Landon
Hicks He doesn’t talk

BRIAN
Who would it be

She thinks for a beat then

AUDREY
The water guy

BRIAN
The water guy

AUDREY
He reminds me of a cowboy

BRIAN
The guy that delivers the Arrowhead
water reminds you of a cowboy

She confirms through her laughter After they quiet Audrey
lays her head on his chest He throws his leg over her
knees She grabs his arm so it’s now draped around her with
his hand resting on the back of her neck

AUDREY
Do it

Brian continues to stare at his ceiling She grabs his hand
and furrows it under her hair

AUDREY
Do it

And he sighs then runs his hand up and down the back of her
neck She loves this Then

BRIAN
His head’s going under tomorrow
even if I have to push it

Audrey lets out a little laugh

AUDREY
Oh that’s nice

And they lay there Her head on his chest his leg sprawled
over her knees his hand running the nape of her neck

INT BURKE HOUSEAUDREY’S STUDIO - EVENING

The basement is a make-shift restoration studio A canvas
sheet covers the floor Old pieces of stripped furniture
line the wall

Audrey surveys a half-finished sideboard in the middle of the
room Brian appears from behind and wraps him arms around her

She just nods She doesn’t want to fight so they stand
there Looking at the piece

AUDREY
The walnut stain wasn’t a good
choice I totally fucked this up

BRIAN
No you didn’t It looks great

AUDREY
I can’t get an honest opinion out
of you You love everything I do

(upset churning aloud)

I hand-strip it I remove the old
finish from top to bottom I even
out color tones I check the
glides I steam I sand I
detail I stain

He takes in a big whiff of her hair nuzzles her neck

AUDREY
And after all of that all of
that work
(a beat)

I only have one chance at the
finish Because if I screw that up
-- it kills the whole thing

Whispering into her ear

BRIAN
I’m just here to deliver the
water
She laughs
AUDREY

Shut up

And he turns her around kisses her She kisses him back
Long and deep

They begin to heat up She pushes him back against the wall
kissing him untucking his shirt He grabs her hair tugs it
back exposes her neck kisses it She grinds up against
him Reaches for his pants unbuttons the top but from
the kitchen

HARPER (0S)
Dad

Aroused and breathless

BRIAN
I told them I’d get Coldstone

And she’s a little frustrated turned on But she steps back
and collects herself Breaking into a smile

Which he returns with
BRIAN
To be continued
EXT SEATTLE HEIGHTSPARKING LOT - NIGHT
Brian heads out of the Cold Stone holding the ice cream

As he walks toward the minivan he notices something across
the way

A MAN leaning up against a van breathing heavily distressed

BRIAN
Are you okay

The man doesn’t answer Brian notices blood on the man’s
hands as he walks toward him

BRIAN
Excuse me Are you--

And Brian stops sees something on the ground

A WOMAN

lying in a pool of blood -- severely beaten

BRIAN
Jesus

And the man collects his breath and shouts out

DISTRESSED MAN
Fuck

As he kicks her very hard She lets out a squeal
Brian runs over

BRIAN
Whoa

The man then bangs his fist into the side of the van Hard
The man totally unhinged The woman barely conscious

BRIAN
Jesus

DISTRESSED MAN
Shes my wife

BRIAN
She’s dying

The man is hysterical Crying and pounding the van

DISTRESSED MAN

DISTRESSED MAN

BRIAN

DISTRESSED MAN

Brian takes out his cellular and dials 911 He waits

DISTRESSED MAN
She broke my fucking heart

And Brian’s calm -- doesn’t want to upset this man anymore
than he is

BRIAN
Jesus damn it pick up
(to the distressed man)
Take a deep breath you need to
calm down

The man has a seat on the ground throws his head in his
hands and weeps

DISTRESSED MAN
I love her

And Brian notices this distressed man is holding something
in his bloody hand what he used to beat her down a 22

Caliber handgun

BRIAN
Breathe Count down from ten

DISTRESSED MAN
I I Ten nine

We’re close on Brian now as he speaks into the phone
We can hear the man counting down -- on six

BRIAN
Yes I need an ambulance at South
West Vista avenue and Elm there
is a woman here who is badly
beaten

And off screen the man stops counting after four
Looking down at the woman Brian talks into the phone

BRIAN
It’s domestic Her husband is very
upset he’s going to need medical
assistance as well

Brian doesn’t ask for police or indict the man at all he
knows that could bring trouble

Brian’s mind races trying to remain calm And he turns to
see the man is no longer on the ground

AND BRIAN BURKE

Close on As he looks up As his face washes white

BRIAN
No You love her Don’t

And Brian dives forward as we hear a LOUD

CRASH

Audrey jumps back with a start She’s wrapped up in a towel
in her bathroom with the bath running The crash came from
downstairs from the

KITCHEN

Harper stands over a broken glass trying to pick up the large
chards Audrey heads in with her towel wrapped around herself

Your suit is too big

Jerry laughs Stops and looks down at Dory’s big eyes

JERRY

Jerry takes a breath Close to losing it Looks at Harper
JERRY
Your favorite song is “Strawberry

And you got that scar on your nose

Dory laughs

DORY
But it wasn’t

HARPER
We all know that Dory

And Jerry looks at Dory

JERRY
You hate mimes They scare you

DORY
They don’t talk

And Jerry’s so unsure of himself swaying back and forth in
place the nervous mannerisms of a child

Harper smiles Tears stream down her face
But she still smiles

HARPER
Youre funny

Jerry slowly nods Silence He looks at both kids their
silent eyes their plaintive expressions

And he finally says

JERRY
He was my best friend

Harper holds still Looks strong into Jerry’s eyes

HARPER

JERRY
When I was your age

With that Jerry forces a smile

Jerry hands her a cigarette
As she lights it
BRENDA
What are you doing with yourself

She lets out an unsure laugh She tries to read him was he
serious Can’t tell -- so she just says his name again

BRENDA
Jerry Sunborne

He nods Silence until

BRENDA
Jerry you had the most intense
eyes I was in love with you

Jerry forces the smallest of smiles

BRENDA
But then again everyone was

And Jerry holds the tears back as he draws in a deep drag

INT BURKE HOUSELIVING ROOM - DAY
Jerry stands against the wall again Neal finds him

NEAL
Jerry do you need a ride back

him Audrey Burke

And the world closes in on Jerry as she slowly walks over

NEAL
Audrey you know Jerry

She looks at him Doesn’t smile

AUDREY
It’s been a long time Jerry

JERRY
I’m sorry for your loss

Neal heads off to greet someone They’re left alone
Silence Uncomfortable

AUDREY
Thank you for coming
JERRY
It’s no problem

Another silence
JERRY
Well I’m going to go Once again
I’m sorry

But he doesn’t go Because she keeps staring right at

AUDREY
I hated you

JERRY
Excuse me

AUDREY
I hated you for years

And Jerry slowly lets it register

AUDREY
He was loyal to a fault And he
never judged

JERRY
I know

AUDREY
It wouldve been so easy for him to
give up on you I would’ve
anybody wouldve

Another silence Until

AUDREY

Will you stay a little longer
JERRY

Why
AUDREY

I don’t know
And he holds her cold stare Until

JERRY
I‘ll stay a little longer

And she accepts this with a slow nod

him

EXT SIDE OF THE BURKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Jerry stands by the trash He draws in a long toke from his
bowl holds it in Closes his eyes and leans his head back
against the wall And he exhales

Then he breaks down completely breaks down Crouches into
against the wall Becomes small Shudders and shakes Sobs
and cries

Then Jerry stops on the dime Takes in another hit and
stands Collects himself That quick -- the briefest of
paroxysms And he sees a carton of chocolate milk in the
trash And for some reason this makes him smile

INT BURKE HOUSEKITCHEN - NIGHT

The dishes are all cleaned and stacked the help has left
The children are asleep upstairs Diane Neal Howard

the Anderson’s guests at Flathead
Country Club and we’re all swimming
in the pool

The room is rapt Jerry connects a look with Audrey and
nervously averts it Audrey doesn’t -- holds the stare

BRENDA
All of the sudden Brian gets out
of the water pulls down his
bathing suit and takes a piss right
in the pool

Laughter

NEAL
No

Diane works the room with a bottle of wine refilling all
empty glasses

BRENDA
Just like that I can still see
June Andersons face people are

freaking out He’s peeing right
into the pool like it’s a urinal

AUDREY
Oh wait he did tell me this

BRENDA
After it was over I asked him
“Why did you do that” I mean he
wasn’t a troubled child He never
acted out He was quiet you know

Brenda’s eyes reach for her brain trying to remember

BRENDA
I forgot what he said It was so
funny I asked him why he did it
and he came back with something
that made no sense

Jerry says something under his breath while pondering his
shoes They all look over to him He looks up clears his
throat and then says it again

JERRY
“IT didn’t want to get my bathing
suit wet”

BRENDA

Yes That was it

NEAL
But he was in the pool

BRENDA
He was a little retarded as a kid

They all look at her Except for Audrey who still glares at
Jerry He becomes uncomfortable under her gaze

BRENDA
I’m sorry but he was He was slow
But he came around

And she begins to tear up Silence Now Jerry looks up
Bravely into Audrey’s hold and says it again with a
reminiscent smile

JERRY
I didn’t want to get my bathing
suit wet

But Audrey doesn’t return the smile Just regards him

relapsed

And each time you quit you go
through withdrawal

them your intestines your
kidneys your liver You can
actually feel them individually all
big and throbbing inside of you
And you throw up until there’s
nothing left to throw up and then
you throw up blood

And you get a fever and you get
delirious and you hallucinate the

Audrey pretends everything is fine
I don’t think she’s facing reality
Every few seconds Jerry falls behind and fights to catch up

JERRY
Is she going to have to get a job

HOWARD
Who told you that

Jerry doesn’t answer
HOWARD

The house was paid off years ago
Brian was very good at being a
developer He thought out of the

rehabbing space he saw
opportunities in places nobody
could see and that paid off

(then)
Audrey’1l never have to worry about
money

different kind

As she misses the shot

HARPER
It’s a sad movie now

When you go to highschool the movie
will turn into a comedy and when
you go to college maybe it’ll be a
romance And after you get married

itll be a horror movie but ina
good way

like he’s skiing

AUDREY
He’s always run like that

I remember the precise moment I
realized Brian loved me I

remember what he was wearing it

(and then)
From them on no matter what I

did no matter what issue we were
dealing with I could look into
his eyes and feel loved

He takes that in then

stumbled a lot while life made
itself easy for me But then it
changed It switched

(a beat)
While I was choosing heroin Brian
was choosing the right college
the right friends the right
career

She thinks about that as Jerry regards her Then

woman

it’s like being loved in a way that
only children can feel and adults
forget ever existed

AUDREY

JERRY
But that’s just at first

She listens He sorts his thoughts

JERRY
Then you chase it You chase that
initial feeling But you never can
get it back You can get the
escape and you do get high but
never like the first few times

She thinks about it then
AUDREY

If I didn’t have those children
I’d do heroin all day Id chase
that first time and then I’d chase
the feeling I had on my wedding day
and the day Harper was born

(and then)
And then I’d chase the way Brian
made me feel when he looked at me
Id chase it all until I died
