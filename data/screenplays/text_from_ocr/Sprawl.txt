FADE IN

We creep in the night over miles of LIGHTS the garish glow
that is LOS ANGELES an endless sprawling city where it’s
easier to disappear than be discovered

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET NIGHT

A VOLKSWAGEN drives down a dark street Out of place ina
shuttered industrial area It stops at a RED LIGHT

INT VOLKSWAGEN NIGHT

A MARRIED COUPLE PAUL is behind the wheel JEN points to the
median where a BUM sits in a WHEELCHAIR dressed in rags

JEN
What is that

PAUL
(looking)
Someone who’s about to be a pain in my
ass

Sure enough the BUM rolls over to the driver’s window

PAUL (contd)
Great shortcut honey

JEN
Just give him some cash At least his
sign is funny

A SIGN hanging around the Bum’s neck reads “PORSCHE FUND”

Paul LAUGHS He digs out his wallet and rolls the window
down He holds out FIVE DOLLARS

PAUL
Screw the Porsche Get yourself a
Ferrari pal

The Bum doesn’t move to take the money He lifts his head
half his face is wrapped in FILTHY BANDAGES

PAUL (contd)
(creeped-out)
Hey just take the money man
Suddenly GLASS SHATTERS Jen SCREAMS Paul looks over as
JEN IS YANKED THROUGH THE WINDOW by SOMETHING UNSEEN

Paul tries to grab her but she disappears into the darkness
PAUL (contd)
Jen JENNIFER

Terrified Paul puts the car in park and opens his door
OUTSIDE he sees the WHEELCHAIR TOPPLED OVER EMPTY
Next to it is the BUM’S SIGN
Paul scans the area frantic no idea what’s happening
PAUL (contd)
(to himself)
He’s gone Holy shit it got them both
(screaming)

HELP HELP ME

Paul SLAMS his door he whips out his cell-phone before he
can dial an ALARM startles him But it’s not the phone

A DASHBOARD LIGHT WARNS
“REAR DOOR AJAR”

Before Paul can turn around a MEATY TENDRIL wraps around his
neck and CHOKES THE LIFE OUT OF HIM

CUT TO
a SMALL PATCH OF LIGHT hiding beyond the San Gabriel
Mountains at the northern end of LA County This is Santa
Clarita

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET NIGHT

Sleepy suburbia tucked safely in the canyons Cookie-cutter
houses and cul-de-sacs

HEADLIGHTS sweep around a corner a shiny new Mustang GROWLS
as it cruises down the street

INT MUSTANG NIGHT

CHASE 17 a chiseled quarterback drives with an arm around
ASHLEY BOYER 16 blonde beautiful boldly flirtatious

Shes dressed for cheerleader practice he wears his jersey
By all appearances the perfect high school power couple

CHASE
I’m stoked we finally got a chance to
talk Ashley It’s cool I could drive you
home
Ashley smiles flattered She touches Chase’s shoulder

ASHLEY
Well we don’t have to go straight home

Chase looks at Ashley’s hand on his shoulder and the naughty
look on her face He grins

CHASE
No We definitely don’t have to go
straight home

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET NIGHT
The Mustang crawls into the darkness between streetlights

Just as it passes THREE FIGURES in BLACK HOODED SWEATSHIRTS
scurry after the car disappearing into the night

INT MUSTANG NIGHT

Chase parks He eyes Ashley she GIGGLES Chase puts a hand
on Ashley’s knee slides it up her thigh Ashley playfully
stops him

ASHLEY
You know Chase my dad’s a cop he’s
very concerned about the type of guy I
hang out with
(beat)
I heard you got into a fight yesterday

Chase LAUGHS

CHASE
Some redheaded fag was checking me out in
the shower I taught him a lesson

ASHLEY
That might get you into some trouble

CHASE
I’m the starting quarterback Ashley I
never get in trouble I could get away
with murder

Chase tries to kiss her Ashley pulls back looks around
ASHLEY

Let’s park in the cul-de-sac There’s
more privacy
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET NIGHT
The Mustang PURRS into the dark cul-de-sac

A moment later the THREE HOODED FIGURES step into the glow
of the streetlight

We can’t see their faces we can see their GUNSTOCKS
They creep toward the cul-de-sac
EXT CUL-DE-SAC NIGHT

Pitch black No signs of life in the surrounding houses The
Mustang’s lights turn off

INT MUSTANG NIGHT
Chase gazes at Ashley she smiles seductively

CHASE
Youre a wicked little flirt aren’t you

ASHLEY
Flirting’s half the fun

CHASE
What’s the other half

Ashley leans in to kiss Chase

THUMP Something hits the car Startled Chase and Ashley
look out the rear window FOOTBALL PADS block their view

ASHLEY
Did somebody hit us

CHASE
I can’t see

THUMP Something SPLATTERS the WINDSHIELD scaring them

ASHLEY
Oh my God What is that

CHASE
It’s not your dad is it

CRACK The DRIVER’S WINDOW SPIDERWEBS Ashley SCREAMS and
bolts out of the car leaving the door open
EXT CUL-DE-SAC NIGHT

Ashley runs off The Mustang is pelted by projectiles Chase
is trapped inside

BANG An M80 EXPLODES in the car Chase dives out arms
raised in surrender

CHASE
Please Stop

Chase discovers the three Hooded Figures To him they look
like Grim Reapers Terror sinks in

CHASE (contd)
What do you want Don’t do this

One of the Figures takes aim and fires
The projectile whizzes past Chase’s head and dents his car

Chase cowers When he does he gets a clear look at what’s
been shot at him POTATOES

CHASE (contd)
Potatoes
(to his attackers)
Whoever you are you’re dead You hear
me You’re dead

A Hooded Figure reveals a BROWN PAPER BAG LIGHTS IT ON FIRE
and tosses it at Chase’s feet

Chase knows exactly what it is
CHASE (contd)
You think I’m an idiot That’s a bag of

dog shit I’m not gonna step on it

BANG THE FLAMING BAG EXPLODES spraying Chase with SHIT
Disgusted he gags

CUT TO

BACKYARDS where Ashley runs as fast as she can through the
darkness She hurries across the OVERGROWN LAWN of

EXT ABANDONED HOUSE NIGHT

where she races around back and tries to open the door it
won’t budge She POUNDS on it No answer

When she turns around TWO OF THE HOODED FIGURES are behind
her They’re aiming POTATO GUNS Ashley SCREAMS
ASHLEY
Assholes You scared the hell out of me
(catching her breath)
I almost had to kiss that douche-bag

Ashley smiles The Figures remove their hoods to reveal

NATHAN HAWLEY and RAY GIRARDI both 16 lifelong friends
polar opposites

Nathan is 100 lbs soaking-wet and dripping with sarcasm a
smart kid in a permanent awkward phase He uses an INHALER

Ray is all muscle and mischief volatile when bored A teen
destined for trouble

Together they’re the perfect pranksters

NATHAN

Ray offers his fist to Ashley for a pound

RAY

night

ASHLEY
It was my pleasure that homophobic prick
got what he deserved

The third Hooded Figure bursts from the bushes jolting them

NATHAN
Jesus Tony

He removes his hood to reveal TONY 16 a REDHEAD with a
BLACK-EYE that mars his boyish face

TONY
Sorry I stayed back to revel in the
moment I’d say Chase’s gay-bashing days
are over Thanks Ashley And thank you

Tony hands his potato gun over to Nathan Ray does too
RAY
Thank Nathan he’s the man with the plan

ASHLEY
Who knew quiet little Nathan Hawley was a
potato gun wielding warrior

NATHAN (contd)
I told you not to bring anything here
that can link us to this place

MICAH

Nathan rips the posters down

NATHAN
Eventually someone is going to try to
buy this house How long do you think
it’1ll take to connect these posters with
the ones hanging in our bedrooms

MICAH
Unclench kid The Recession continues
No one’s buying this shithole We’re

ASHLEY
Is there a bathroom I need to get the
potato out of my hair

Micah points down the hall

MICAH
End of the hall baby-cakes

Ashley walks off Micah tries to peek under Ashley’s
cheerleader uniform Nathan pulls Micah up by his collar

NATHAN

Brooke Goldstein a new pair of shoes

NATHAN

TONY

the defibrillator upstairs right

NATHAN
Get Out Now

MICAH
Nate just accept the fact you have no
shot with Ashley Once a girl sees me

gravitational pull

EXT NATHAN’S HOUSE NIGHT

Nathan and Ray approach the quaint quiet house

RAY
Alright man I’ll see you tomorrow

NATHAN
You know I am going to ask Ashley out

RAY
Sorry Nate but you’re about as likely to
ask Ashley Boyer out as Micah is to see
his nuts without a mirror

NATHAN
Hey I’ve got the date already planned
It’s just I’m retarded around her I
can’t come up with anything cool to say

RAY
How about “Hi Wanna go out”

Nathan thinks this over Ray’s got a point
NATHAN
Youre right I’1ll just ask her Tomorrow
morning On the bus
(beat)

RAY

Ray punches Nathan’s shoulder hard

RAY (contd)
But it’1ll hurt less than that

Ray runs off LAUGHING Nathan heads for the door wincing

BOTTLE OF XANAX

NATHAN
Tell me you didn’t cancel it

LINDA
I thought it was a mistake

NATHAN
No It was to celebrate after I get my
driver’s license

Linda smiles she’s touched by the gesture

LINDA
That’s very sweet But you don’t have to
take me to a restaurant in Beverly Hills

Nathan looks away suddenly very uncomfortable

NATHAN
Uh Mom I was gonna take Ashley Boyer
On a date

Linda looks at Nathan in disbelief

LINDA
Nathan do you really think I’m going to
let you drive into LA the first day you
get your license It’s too dangerous You
could get into an accident get carjacked-

NATHAN
-I’ve been planning this for months

LINDA
Well your plans just changed kiddo You
have no reservation and no car

NATHAN
It’s not even your car Dad bought it
He’d let me drive it

LINDA
Hey if you can find him you can ask to
borrow his car

EXT WEAVER HIGH SCHOOL DAY

We float above the fenced-in campus only a watchtower away
from being a prison

INT WEAVER HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY CLASS DAY
Nathan sits beside Tony gazing across the room at Ashley
Micah sits next to Ray at the back of the class

Draped in a lab coat gloves and goggles MR BAKER lectures
from behind his LAB TABLE
BAKER
Yesterday we talked about the
conservation of mass Today we’re going
to demonstrate it with a little bang

Baker fills a BEAKER with water unwraps a SODIUM METAL BLOCK
and shaves off a small piece

BAKER (contd)
In front of me is a beaker of good old
H20 This is a sliver of sodium metal

Baker drops the sliver of sodium into the beaker
The sliver reacts whipping around the surface of the water
SPARKS flare into FLAMES and then BANG A small bright
EXPLOSION erupts from the beaker
Nathan is in awe
Baker wraps the sodium block and locks it in the cabinet
BAKER (contd)

A violent chemical change just occurred

But the molecules that formed the water

and the sodium have not been destroyed

Their atoms have been shifted around to

form new molecules Let’s map out the

chemical reaction-

Baker extends the retractable PERIODIC TABLE As soon as he
does the Class LAUGHS

Taped to the table is a DRAWING OF A COCK AND BALLS

BAKER (cont’d)
Goddamnit

Baker rips the drawing down

BAKER (contd)
Who did this

Baker crumples the paper to throw it away Suddenly his
HANDS TURN BLACK

BAKER (cont’d)
Jesus Christ

The Class is in HYSTERICS Tony leans over to Nathan

TONY
Silver nitrate on the hands Nice touch

NATHAN
Wasn’t me

Nathan glances at Ray who coolly leans back in his chair

RAY
Stroke it too much and your hands turn
black Conservation of massive amounts of
jerking off

The Class LAUGHS Baker smoldering rinses his hands

BAKER

You know what Girardi I’ve been doing
this for seventeen years And every year
a moron like you is hellbent on wasting
everyone’s time Inevitably that same
moron turns out to be a nobody the guy
who pumps my gas the slug who delivers
my lunch the loser who cleans my pool

(beat)
Congratulations you’re well on your way
to becoming a complete waste of life

The Class OOOHS Ray enraged springs to his feet

RAY
Who the hell are you to talk about me

Nathan and Tony are concerned

BAKER
Sit down

RAY
Say something to my face

BAKER
I said sit down

Ray barrels toward Baker
RAY
Call me a waste again I’11 put my fist

down your throat

Ray is right in Baker’s face Baker is terrified The Class
is uneasy Nathan stands

NATHAN
Ray

Ray glares at Baker a bomb ready to detonate Nathan runs to
his friend’s side

NATHAN (contd)
You don’t want to do this

Baker backs away toward a WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
BAKER
Go to the Principal’s office Now before

NATHAN

On his way out Ray sweeps a rack of TEST TUBES off the
table they SHATTER on the floor

Nathan returns to his seat He notices Ashley staring off
after Ray she grins impressed

Nathan taps her on the shoulder to get her attention

NATHAN (contd)
Dana-—

She twists his arm behind his back Nathan winces

DANA

It’s quiet Nathan dejected rides in circles on a LITTLE
GIRL’S BICYCLE complete with TRAINING WHEELS and YVONNE the
one-legged sex-doll taped to the handlebars

DOWN A STEEP HILL traffic passes at a busy intersection
Ray climbs the hill and watches Nathan concerned

RAY
This is disturbing

NATHAN
(sarcastic)
This is my perfect life dude I’ve got a
girlfriend I don’t have to talk to and I
can pedal her anywhere in the
neighborhood

Nathan attempts a wheelie He falls on his ass

RAY
You okay

Nathan stays flat on his back

Ray hops on the bike and does figure-eights

RAY
Would that really have mattered

NATHAN
Probably not My mother will never let me
drive I’m never going to ask Ashley out
and she’s more into you anyway

Ray stops and stares hard at Nathan

RAY

You want to know why she likes me and not
you Because I’ll do anything I don’t
think about it I don’t worry about it I
just do it That’s the difference between
you and me

(beat)
You have a chance to take the girl youve
been pining for all year to see a kick-
ass band play the Viper Room and you
won’t just do it

In a flash Ray shoots the bicycle out from underneath him
It speeds down the hill toward the unsuspecting traffic in
the intersection Yvonne along for the ride

Nathan watches in horror as

Yvonne and the bicycle roll into the INTERSECTION CRUNCH A
car crushes Yvonne shredding her face against the pavement

trying to dance with Ray He knows Nate is in serious pain

TONY
Do you know why I tried out for football

Nathan shakes his head “no”

TONY (cont’d)

crush him to know I was gay I thought if
I made the football team he’d love me
even if he found out I lied that I got
the black-eye during tryouts and told him
I was quitting He said “only fairies
quit”

NATHAN
He’s an asshole

TONY
The point is some people are just never
gonna love you No matter what you do
That’s harsh but if you accept it you
won’t waste time trying to change their
minds And you definitely shouldn’t waste
your time standing here alone You’re in
a club full of beautiful girls most of
whom are tripping on Dana’s shit The
possibilities are endless

for her lipstick she sways suddenly tipsy

Dana notices something in her drink 20 RED DOT TABS

It’s been spiked Dana looks around catching trails off the
lights

DANA
Oh shit

She sees the Rocker coming toward her smiling
His FACE DISTORTS his features melt into a mangled mess

She turns away but there’s no safe place to look Everything
twists into something demented

Dana stumbles through the crowd searching for a sanctuary
She crawls into a DARK CORNER and holds herself She covers
her dilated eyes with the glowing glasses

DANA (cont’d)
Just a bad trip That’s all A bad trip

For Dana the Patrons become mauled mutants beings Francis
Bacon would create Something CLOAKED IN BLACK approaches

STROBE LIGHTS illuminate part of a FACE it’s REPTILIAN
lumpy LEATHERY SKIN surrounds a MILKY GREEN EYE

Freaked Dana crawls along the wall dodging DEMONS she sees
every time the lights flash She checks over her shoulder

the beast rushes toward her

Tweaked and terrified Dana tries to cut through the crowd
she stumbles into the middle of a mosh-pit

Dana SCREAMS in fear as Fester Fans SCREAM in delight She’s
spit out of the pit into a dark corner where she cowers
frantically scanning the crowd for her pursuer

A flash of light reveals the BEAST right behind her It
flings Dana down a flight of stairs

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS Dana leg badly broken gazes
eyes-wide at

the BEAST shrouded in darkness atop the stairs

DANA (cont’d)
LEAVE ME ALONE

The beast lumbers down the steps Dana discovers she’s lying
against the EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR She reaches up to push the

door open but the handle is just beyond her grasp

The beast is upon her Dana hysterical POUNDS on the door

PLEASE

The beast lifts its leg Dana sees a CLOVEN HOOF it stomps
down with thunderous force

BLOOD SPATTERS the FIRE EXIT SIGN Dana SCREAMS in agony
it’s cut short when

the beast stabs something into Dana’s temple She goes limp
Her GLOWING GLASSES fall to the floor broken and BLOODY

A TIRE-PRESSURE GAUGE sticks out of Dana’s head the PLASTIC
METER EXTENDS as blood squirts from her wound

Ray he’s going to hit you

RAY
It’s not running

NATHAN
It’s a hybrid you can’t hear it running

The Teens warily watch Ray unaware that IN THE SHADOWS
BEHIND THEM is ANOTHER GUNMETAL PRIUS

RAY

(to his Prius)
Get out of the car

Ray kicks the bumper furious

ASHLEY
Ray stop

TONY
You’re making it worse

MICAH
Kick it again

NATHAN
Goddamnit Ray GET OUT OF THE WAY

HEADLIGHTS BLAZE BEHIND RAY the real Prius speeds forward

The Prius clips Ray His body slams against the car his head
whips back SHATTERING the rear driver’s-side window

Ray hits the ground disoriented MOANING

The Teens rush toward Ray but the Prius blocks their path
Its HORN BLARES the Teens freeze in shock

Nathan steps forward gingerly

NATHAN (contd)
Hey man I know you’re pissed okay I
would be too We’re assholes But this
is nuts

The Prius is silent

NATHAN (contd)
Look we’ll pay for any damage I
promise I’ll give you my name address
anything you want

The frightened Teens await an answer After a moment the
PRIUS’ MOONROOF CRACKS OPEN just enough to expose the tip of
a MANGLED TENDRIL

MICAH
What is that

NATHAN
I don’t know

MICAH
It looks like meat

TONY
I think it’s pointing at someone

They watch the tendril writhe it stops pointed at Ashley

ASHLEY
Oh God it’s me It wants me

Nathan steps in front of Ashley

NATHAN
Not gonna happen

Suddenly Ray jumps up and reaches into the broken rear
window clawing at the unseen driver

RAY
Nate get out of here

The Prius speeds backwards Ray is thrown off balance but he
won’t let go

He struggles to keep his feet clear of the spinning tires he
loses his grip and crashes to the ground

The Prius reverses over Ray’s legs crippling him Ray
SCREAMS in agony

NATHAN
Ray No

Micah and Jeff cringe Tony is terrified

TONY
What the hell is it SOMEBODY HELP

ASHLEY

Ashley runs toward Ray Ray bloody and broken SCREAMS

RAY

Nathan catches Ashley and grabs her She fights him

ASHLEY
Let me go

The Prius inches forward and pins Ray’s arm Ray MOANS

RAY
Run Nathan Run

The Teens don’t move maybe they can’t

NATHAN
We’re not leaving you

Ray face bloody forces a smile

RAY
I’ve got him right where I want him
just run RUN

The Prius decides for them It lurches forward and rolls
right over Ray GRINDING HIM INTO THE PAVEMENT

The Prius plows toward Nathan Ashley Micah Tony and Jeff
who scramble clear as it slides into a METAL GARAGE DOOR
bending it open

The Prius backs up Nathan shoves the Teens through the
opening in the door to

INT SERVICE GARAGE NIGHT

where the Teens scurry down into a NARROW SERVICE WELL cut
into the garage floor just as

the Prius SMASHES through the garage door and skids to stop
right over their heads

IN THE SERVICE WELL inches below the Prius the trembling
Teens try to keep quiet

IN THE GARAGE the Prius hits the HIGH BEAMS illuminating
the area there’s no place to hide A WARNING SIGN reads

“OPEN FLOOR”

Suddenly the Prius SPINS ITS TIRES SMOKE PLUMES off of
them filling the garage

IN THE SERVICE WELL the THICK SMOKE suffocates the Teens
They try not to COUGH but it’s no use

Nathan takes a hit off his inhaler

NATHAN
It knows we’re down here

MICAH
You got us trapped

Nathan searches for anything he can find all he sees are
SHELVES filled with OIL FILTERS RAGS and FILTER WRENCHES

ON THE WALL he spots TWO BUTTONS with UP and DOWN ARROWS He
gazes up at the Prius its tires still spinning

NATHAN
It’s a lift
(beat)
Pull the arms under the car

Micah steps on a shelf and looks between the Prius’
undercarriage and the garage floor He waves away the SMOKE
and discovers

TWO CAR LIFT SWING-ARMS He pulls the arms under the Prius’
driver’s-side CLANG The arms lock into place

Nathan moves to the passenger-side through the smoke he sees
TWO MORE SWING-ARMS As he reaches for them the MEATY
TENDRIL SWIPES AT HIS ARM

Nathan quickly recoils

NATHAN (contd)
Shit

Ashley pounds the button the lift activates rasing the
Prius’ driver’s-side The car tilts up on two wheels

CRUNCH The swing-arm buckles and the lift stops It’s
broken There’s barely enough room for the Teens to escape

The Prius jerks back and forth trying to drive off the lift

NATHAN (contd)
We’ve gotta run Go

Nathan ushers the Teens out of the well they squeeze
underneath the Prius

IN THE GARAGE the Teens bolt through the destroyed door to

EXT HOLLYWOOD TOYOTA NIGHT

where Nathan Ashley Micah Tony and Jeff race across the
lot They come upon RAY’S CRUSHED BODY

Nathan stops in shock He stares at his dead friend

A LOUD BANG comes from the garage Ashley Micah Tony and
Jeff come back to collect Nathan

TONY
Nate we have to go

The Teens hurry out of the lot running for their lives
EXT HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD NIGHT

The Teens scurry down the boulevard sprinting past CLOSED
STRIP MALLS and EMPTY STOREFRONTS no one around to help
They may as well be running blindly through the woods

MICAH
It killed him it killed Ray

Nathan glances back there’s no sign of the Prius

NATHAN
It’s gone We have to get help Look for
a cop

Nathan darts into the street and tries to flag down a passing
car It HONKS at him and speeds off

Tony spies a PAY PHONE

TONY
Nathan pay phone

The Teens race to the phone scared out of their minds
Ashley frantic grabs the receiver

ASHLEY
I’m calling my dad Give me some change
I need change

The Teens dig through their pockets

NATHAN
I don’t have any change

MICAH
Me neither
ASHLEY
How do you not have change for the
phone

MICAH

Because I have a goddamn cell-phone Who
the hell uses pay phones anymore

Nathan sees a HOMELESS MAN huddled against a storefront

NATHAN
Sir Sir we need some change

The Homeless Man LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY
Tony yanks the phone out of Ashley’s hand
TONY
Call 911 You don’t need change to call
911

Tony is about to dial when Nathan spots the Prius speeding
out of the Toyota dealership headed right toward them

NATHAN
Shit here it comes

TONY
Gimme a second-

NATHAN
-No we gotta go

Nathan pulls Tony away from the phone the Teens bolt down
the boulevard

ASHLEY

The Prius gains on them
Nathan notices a BANK down the street It has an ATM LOBBY
He takes out his dad’s ATM CARD as he runs

NATHAN
Over there

Nathan herds the Teens to the bank
EXT BANK NIGHT

Nathan swipes the card through the card-reader trying to
unlock the door RED LIGHT the door won’t open

The Prius approaches quickly Ashley panics

ASHLEY

Nathan swipes the card again RED LIGHT Micah looks back at
the Prius twenty-feet away and closing

MICAH

Nathan desperate swipes the card again

NATHAN

GREEN LIGHT Nathan throws the door open and shoves the Teens
inside just as

the Prius skids into the place where they stood
INT BANK ATM LOBBY NIGHT

Crammed in the Teens catch their breath Micah nearly pukes
The Prius sits outside the window quiet

Suddenly MUSIC BLARES from within the Prius Christopher
Cross’ “Sailing”

CHRISTOPHER CROSS (VO)
Well it’s not that far down to paradise
at least it’s not for me

The Teens are petrified The Prius calmly backs into a
HANDICAPPED SPOT waiting for them to come out

NATHAN
He’s toying with us We need a cop

MICAH
We need all the cops

Nathan sees the GLASS DOORS leading into the bank He kicks
them as hard as he can

NATHAN
Break the glass There’s gotta be an
alarm

Micah and Jeff kick the glass it doesn’t break

NATHAN (contd)
It’s safety glass it’s shatterproof

Ashley stares at the Prius

ASHLEY
It’s gonna kill us all

NATHAN
No it’s not We just need to think

A MUSCULAR GUY in a UNIFORM walks past outside He stops when
he sees the Prius

TONY
It’s a cop Hey HEY

The Teens POUND on the window and SCREAM to get the Muscular
Guys attention He’s a PARKING ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

PARKING OFFICER
You’re gonna have to move the car

NATHAN
He’s not a cop he’s a meter maid

MICAH
That Prius is chasing us

ASHLEY
He’s crazy

TONY

NATHAN
He’s trying to kill us

The Parking Officer smirks at the Teens

PARKING OFFICER
Very funny Move the car There’s no
parking after ten

MICAH
Dude it’s not our car We need help
Call a real cop

The Parking Officer eyes the Prius sitting quietly in the
handicapped parking space He looks at the Teens irritated

PARKING OFFICER
How about I just give you a real ticket
(beat)
Illegal parking in a handicapped spot
The Parking Officer pulls out a HANDHELD TICKETING MACHINE
and walks toward the Prius to enter its license plate number

NATHAN
Officer we’re not screwing around It’s
not our car-

The PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW CRACKS OPEN just enough to get the
Parking Officer’s attention He walks to the passenger door

The Teens anxiously watch they can’t see into the Prius but
they see the PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW ROLL DOWN

The Parking Officer cringes He tries to pull back but ina
flash his torso is yanked inside the Prius

The Teens jump The Parking Officer’s LEGS THRASH VIOLENTLY
then suddenly GO LIMP

The DRIVER’S-SIDE WINDOW ROLLS DOWN The Parking Officers
body slides out of the Prius and slumps to the ground
VERTEBRAE poke through the skin of his neck

MICAH
That’s not possible

Both windows roll up
CHRISTOPHER CROSS (VO)
Sailing takes me away to where Ive
always heard it could be
Ashley breaks down
ASHLEY

Nathan pulls Ashley aside forces her to look at him

NATHAN

NATHAN

Blart’s head off out there

Nathan stares at the PAY PHONE beyond the Prius
NATHAN

We need to get back to that phone and
call the cops

MICAH
The only way to that phone is past that
psycho

NATHAN

Well create a diversion If we run it
will chase us One of us has to go for
the phone while the rest take off down
the street making it come after us

Nathan surveys the Teens looking for volunteers

NATHAN (contd)
Jeff just run as fast as possible-

JEFF
-Hell no

For a moment they’re all surprised to hear Jeff speak

JEFF (contd)
What because you just met me you think
I’m gonna be cannon-fodder Send Tubby

MICAH
Hey childhood obesity’s a bitch there’s
no way I’m gonna make it to the phone

JEFF

Montana pissed off some maniac
(beat)
We should just hand her over

NATHAN
You don’t say a word the whole night and
that’s the first thing out of your
mouth

MICAH

ASHLEY

MICAH

Nathan hugs Tony

Tony gives Nathan a nod and pushes the door open Nathan
Ashley Micah and Jeff bolt left

The Prius goes after them

The second it leaves the lot Tony barrels out of the bank

EXT STREET NIGHT

Tony sprints for the phone as

Nathan Ashley Micah and Jeff run from the Prius Micah is

well behind the Prius almost on top of him

Suddenly the Prius locks the brakes and spins around It
takes off after Tony

Nathan looks back and sees the Prius pursuing Tony

NATHAN
(to himself)
No No
(yelling)
It’s coming Tony It’s coming

DOWN THE STREET Tony races toward the phone HEADLIGHTS wash
over the road and the pay phone the Prius is close behind

Tony has no choice but to run past the phone

The Prius hops onto the sidewalk nipping at Tony’s heels it
forces Tony to run into the street

The Prius could run Tony down but it doesn’t It lingers a
few feet back moving just fast enough to keep Tony running
Tony looks back distraught

Nathan Ashley Micah and Jeff chase the Prius SCREAMING

NATHAN ASHLEY MICAH and JEFF
WATCH OUT WATCH OUT

Tony faces forward the Prius’ plan becomes clear
Tony has run into an INTERSECTION

A TAXI skids tires SCREECHING Tony braces for impact The
taxi only taps Tony who’s frantic

Tony runs around to the driver’s door
THWAP A TOUR BUS hits Tony from behind
The bus skids leaving Tony’s WIG in a TRAIL OF BLOOD
We hear Christopher Cross CROONING

A BLOCK AWAY Nathan Ashley Micah and Jeff stunned gaze
at the intersection where

the Prius viciously executes a J-turn and goes after them

ASHLEY
It’s coming back Nathan

Ashley hurls TONY’S SHOES at the Prius as it bears down on
them Nathan looks around for a safe place

Ahead Nathan sees an ON-RAMP leading down to the 101
FREEWAY It’s jammed bumper to bumper

NATHAN
It can’t get through traffic C’mon

The Teens sprint down the on-ramp to
EXT 101 FREEWAY NIGHT

Nathan Ashley Micah and Jeff are once again terrified

ASTAN GUY

The Teens have no choice but to climb out to
EXT UNDERPASS NIGHT

where the GANG LEADER stares the Teens down
The Girlfriend leans out of the mini-van

GIRLFRIEND

The Gang Leader keeps his eyes on the Teens

GANG LEADER

The Gang Leader flashes a GANG SIGN The Girlfriend flashes
one back The mini-van drives off

The Gang Leader pulls his GUN The Gangbangers do too

GANG LEADER (cont’d)
Wallets watches phones

Nathan pleads with him

NATHAN

GANG LEADER
Rich kids dressed up to party in LA

Wallets watches and phones

Nathan Micah and Jeff hand their WALLETS over The
Gangbangers frisk them they toss Nathan’s INHALER away
that’s all the boys have

The Gang Leader lingers in front of a frightened Ashley

ASHLEY
I don’t have anything

GANG LEADER
Right the boys buy your drinks But the
bitches I know they all keep a little
cash in their underwear

A tear streaks Ashley’s cheek The Gang Leader tries to wipe
it Nathan steps up and gets a gun pointed in his face

NATHAN
She’s sixteen man

GANG LEADER
She ain’t gonna make it to seventeen

JEFF
(to Micah)
Christ is there anyone in LA who doesn’t
want to kill this girl

GANG LEADER

The Gang Leader digs through the wallets he finds very
little cash but he does find 10 CONDOMS

GANG LEADER (contd)
Which one of you had nine dollars and ten
condoms

Micah scared closes his eyes this won’t end well

MICAH
M-Me

The Gangbangers LAUGH

GANG LEADER
So you thought you’d roll your massive
ass into LA with nine dollars and bang
ten bitches

MICAH
Or one bitch ten times

No one laughs Micah regrets making the joke The Gang Leader
tucks the condoms into Nathan’s shirt pocket

GANG LEADER
I’m not gonna use any condoms

The Gang Leader pulls Ashley away from the group

Nathan lunges for Ashley the Gang Leader cracks him in the
head with his pistol Nathan drops wincing

The Gang Leader shoves Ashley against the wall and trains
his gun on Nathan

The Gangbangers aim at Micah and Jeff ready to shoot But a
BARELY AUDIBLE HISS GROWS LOUDER closer

GANG LEADER (contd)
What the hell is that

A DARK SHAPE rockets out of the night

WHUMP WHUMP WHUMP The three Gangbangers are plowed into by
the Prius their bodies bounce over the car

Nathan Micah and Jeff dive clear Against the wall Ashley
SCREAMS

The Prius slides to a stop taking out a TRAFFIC SIGN that
lands across its hood

The Gangbangers are mauled GUNS strewn about
Micah and Jeff dart behind a nearby DUMPSTER

Nathan grabs a GUN off the ground and drags Ashley over to
where Micah and Jeff are hiding

NATHAN
I got a gun

BEHIND THE DUMPSTER Nathan can’t see what’s happening He
and Ashley crawl under the dumpster where they watch

the Prius’ GLOWING RED TAILLIGHTS illuminate
the Gang Leader still alive he writhes and COUGHS BLOOD

The DRIVER’S DOOR CRACKS OPEN but it’s BUTTED AGAINST A
WALL The door HITS the wall several times then SLAMS SHUT

After a moment the PASSENGER DOOR OPENS all Nathan can see
are LEGS as they slowly slide out

In the darkness it’s hard to make out much The legs lumber
over to the front of the Prius where they pause

They move to the Gang Leader gait off-kilter Almost alien
What the Gang Leader sees horrifies him

GANG LEADER
Oh God Oh God NO WAIT-

The TRAFFIC SIGN chops into the Gang Leader’s throat BLOOD
SPLATTERS across the words “DEAD END”

UNDER THE DUMPSTER Nathan flinches hitting his head CLANG

Nathan and Ashley see the DRIVER’S LEGS step over the Gang
Leader and stride toward the dumpster

Nathan aims the gun his hand shakes
ASHLEY
(frightened whisper)
Shoot it

BEHIND THE DUMPSTER Micah and Jeff can see the DRIVERS
SHADOW approaching

MICAH
Shoot Nathan

UNDER THE DUMPSTER Nathan trembles it’s not a potato gun

Ashley clasps her hands around Nathan’s It gives him the
strength to fire

BANG BANG BANG BULLETS HIT THE LEGS knocking them back
but they swiftly regain balance and step forward undeterred

NATHAN
What is this thing

ASHLEY
It’s not stopping

NATHAN
Move MOVE

Nathan and Ashley crawl from under the dumpster they gather
Micah and Jeff and hurry down the length of the underpass

MICAH
Why would it save us

NATHAN
It didn’t save us from them it saved us
for itself
A sound like ROLLING THUNDER ERUPTS behind them
Nathan checks over his shoulder and sees

THE DUMPSTER barrelling toward them pushed by the Prius

Nathan looks forward and finds a CONCRETE BUTTRESS it’s a
DEAD END they’re about to be crushed

NATHAN (contd)
Scatter

Nathan shoves Ashley out of the rumbling dumpster’s path

Micah and Jeff bolt in separate directions But Nathan’s not
fast enough He spins around and sees

THE DUMPSTER ROARING right for him five feet away The
CONCRETE BUTTRESS is at his back he’s got no choice

NATHAN (contd)
SHIIIIIIIITTTT

Nathan runs toward the dumpster and jumps onto the lid He
leaps onto the Prius’ roof and slides down the hatchback

Nathan tumbles off the Prius into the street where he rolls
to a stop intact

The Prius slams on the brakes The DUMPSTER SMASHES into the
buttress a DEAFENING BOOM ECHOES through the underpass

Ashley Micah and Jeff scamper to Nathan and help him up

ASHLEY
