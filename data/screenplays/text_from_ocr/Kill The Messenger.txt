Mr Blandon during the years you
were acting as a paid informant for

It was floor to ceiling dollars We
had to rotate the money on the

Nicaraguan mountains are seen in the distance

They drive up to a skeleton of a warehouse half-collapsed
sun-bleached

Webb gets out stares at what’s left of the warehouse

WEBB

depots From Colombia to Nicaragua
And from there to here to your
country--

WEBB

BOSCH
Weaponry Girlfriends for the
generals And then for transport
back the other way north --
cocaine Lots and lots of cocaine

The desolate privacy of the place is numbing to Webb and to
us HOLD then--

-- Webb and Bosch turn TWO vehicles speeding toward them

A group of Nicaraguan MEN with GUNS jump out of the vehicles
Theyre ragtag Nicaraguan militia

He hangs up crosses through the crowds to Weil Webb falls
into step beside Weil

Capitol building in the background A parade of joggers and
tourists passing by Weil looks grim

WEIL
Can I eat my lunch at least
(the papers on Webb’s
knee)
That’s classified How did you get
it

WEBB
A drug dealer gave it to me

WEIL

Perfect

(disgusted throws his

lunch away)
Listen I was John Kerry’s lead
investigator on the senate sub
committee that investigated this
It’s a nightmare You have no idea
what you’re getting into

WEBB
So then you tell me What am I
getting into

WEIL

I’m on the National Security
Council now And I have the trust
of the President and his cabinet
It took me ten years to get back to
that place

(grabs the papers)
Everyone who touched this was
destroyed I lost my marriage my
job My ex convinced the court my
kids were in jeopardy just being in
proximity to me I lost them too
for a while

WEBB
Your name goes nowhere near this
We never spoke I give you my word

Pause Weil looks at him

WEIL
What do you want from me

KILL THE MESSENGER SALMON DRAFT- 71613

WEBB
Tell me about Blandon and Meneses

WEIL
They’re the symptom not the
disease

Joggers approach Weil waits then

WEIL (CONT’D)
We started hearing things about a
particular government agency
Ludicrous impossible things

WEBB
The CIA

WEIL
(nods )
It turned out it wasn’t so
ludicrous Or impossible I
underestimated - badly - how much
the White House wanted to win that
brutal little war

WEBB
Youre telling me the US government
actually got money from the drugs

WEIL
It was just the Agency But they
weren’t pocketing the money They
were too clever for that They let
it detour south flow into Central
America to the rebels to the
Contras

WEBB
It’s too stupid to be true

WEIL
Unless you were the Reagan White
House or the CIA where it was a
whole lot of true

WEBB

Why doesn’t everyone know about
this

KILL THE MESSENGER BUFF PAGES- 72113

WEIL
Because for the first time in the
history of our country the United
States government launched a
propaganda campaign against itself
and against the American people By
the time they were done they had
everyone - Congress the entire
Washington press corps - convinced
that my investigators and I were
all bat-shit crazy

WEBB
Hold on a second--

WEIL
Not the New York Times not CBS
news not the Washington Post -
would touch it with a ten-foot
pole It just went away like it
never happened
(after a long beat)
Ever do anything like this before
(Webb shakes No)
Has your paper

WEBB
Not that I know of

WEIL
This is fancy information you have
And dangerous I’d be remiss if I
didn’t tell you that other
reporters have gone down this
rabbit hole Seasoned reporters who
knew their way around Washington
and Central America

WEBB
What are you telling me

WEIL
I’m telling you that I had an
American citizen a rich Republican
Party fund-raiser a White House
favorite in my office upset about
what he was hearing He believed in
freedom and defeating communism
but not laundering narcotics money
for guns And as he was sitting in
my office in the US

There are ongoing operations you’re
in danger of exposing Operations
that have taken months and years to
set up Thousands of man-hours
Millions to fund

WEBB
How do you know that

MILLER
Well we know you were in
Nicaragua We know you saw Meneses

But obviously so much more--

WEBB
Am I being followed

JONES
What’s your angle Webb That your
government uses scumbags to catch
bigger scumbags Newsflash--

WEBB
I was under the impression you had
something you wanted to say to me
But since you asked No My angle
is that the American government
helped put drugs on its streets to
fund an illegal war

JONES
What you want to say happened never
happened

WEBB

Then why am I here
(points at the silent
agent)

Why is he here

MILLER
We’re not the bad guys Meneses is
a bad guy Ricky Ross is a bad guy--

hours and miss our kids’ soccer
games and birthdays for crappy
government pay to sit in a bunker
somewhere where we figure out all
the ways we can fuck with the
American people

But you guys keep making the same
mistake When do you learn how not

were going to die

these claims

(to Webb)
Mr Webb serious charges what
have you got

WEBB
Um what do you want I mean --

CHRIS MATTHEWS
(ambush )

-- What have you got to prove that
Americans working in the US gov’t
collaborated in selling drugs and
pushing drugs hard drugs crack
cocaine into the African American
community of Los Angeles

WEBB
Well first of all we never said
that Americans working in the gov’t
were doing this- these were
Nicaraguans working for a CIA-run
army

CHRIS MATTHEWS
So it’s Nicaraguans working for the

WEBB
-- the FDN Contras

Ok it’s not now it’s not CIA US
officials

WEBB
Not that we know of so far

CHRIS MATTHEWS
(checks notes)
Okay it’s not US officials ok go
ahead

And what we know is is that these
these cocaine dealers who were
working for the army met with CIA
agents uh again Nicaraguans who
were hired by the CIA to run the
army and they met with them before
they started dealing cocaine and
during the time that they were
dealing cocaine and we have
pictures of them meeting we have
sworn statements that this occurred
and we have --

My eyes are open And you know what

worried about their reputations
terrified the Post and the Times
won’t pluck them from the foothills
of the San Jose Mercury-News and
offer them a job on the

Webb on the bed Has been on the phone Dialing for dollars
A list of names before him All but a few crossed out He
dials a number Recording - this phone line has been
disconnected - beep beep - and he hangs up Dials another
line checks his notes The line rings and rings

He gets up walks to the wall Moves a few cards around

I thought it was horses

Do you remember the letter you
wrote me when we first met

WEBB
The one where I corrected your
grammar You hated that

SUE
No

A sweet smile Then --

SUE (CONTD)
It’s the one where you wrote --
“Words were created to tell of
inner happenings not feelings
What I feel for you is too
important and delicate for words A
touch or a look between us is the
only way to really know whats
true”

She takes his hand

SUE (CONTD)
You were eighteen We were
eighteen

WEBB
I remember

SUE
You already knew what was true
(then)
I just wanted you to want me as
much as you want all of that

But I know it’s never going to

barely enough light in the room to make him out He’s very

TALL Worn Late 50’s

MAN (CONTD)
I’m John Cullen
(waits)
Do you know that name

WEBB
No

CULLEN
I didn’t think so Most of the time
it’s redacted Usually I don’t
exist

Cullen looks at the walls The notes The desolation

WEBB
What do you want

CULLEN
I’m here to give you something

Cullen continues to study Webb’s wall of notes photos

CULLEN (CONTD)
What you found here Gary is a
monster So vast it seems
impossible to understand It’s
really very simple though So
simple a child could understand it

He pulls up a chair next to Webb’s bed Sits
CULLEN (CONT’‘D)

I was recruited by the Agency out
of college

Webb sits up in bed Carefully He knows what Cullen is

CULLEN (CONTD)
I knew Spanish and law and wanted
to do good I wanted to fight some
evil empire I went to Central
America made nice with radicals
and slept with some of the pretty
ones and I turned in their names

Then I started noticing that they

were all disappearing Permanently

The people we hunted murdered -
all they had was this deep desire
to reform the government and have
free elections

WEBB
You have confirmation that these
people actually died

CULLEN

Instead of sorta died

(beat)
After that they asked me to work
my way into a major drug cartel
Early Medellin Back then the
cartels were small I solved their
logistical issues Getting supply

WEBB
But theres someone in Washington
who knows what you do and is not
stopping you from doing it

Cullen nods in the affirmative

CULLEN

(begins to get upset)
Its all lies and corruption
Youre attracted to the power and
then you become addicted to the
power and then you are a slave to
the power And then you are
devoured by the power

WEBB
Your thing and my thing-- are they
connected Are they the same

Cullen looks at him A cocktail of annoyance and sympathy

KILL THE MESSENGER CHERRY PAGES- 73013

HF

CULLEN

You are a good reporter Gary But
not a great one You have too much
arrogance You need to be small
before your story In awe of what
you find

Yes They are the same

Webb’s eyes closed There it is Finally Cullen takes an
envelope out of his pocket and tosses it on the table

CULLEN (CONT’‘D)

(ad libbing)
You know my first story was about
a dog that shoulda died but
wouldn’t I was twenty-two It was
a stupid little feature but I was
proud of it and I put it ina
frame and hung it up and believed
I joined a secret guild of
reporters If there ever was a true
believer it was me

Some in the audience are nodding

WEBB (CONTD)
My last story - I filed it just
this morning - was about a police
horse in Cupertino California that
died of constipation

He gets a gust of relieved laughter

WEBB (CONTD)
Actually that’s not a joke

But start with a dog end with a
pile of horseshit There’s a kind
of poetry to that isn’t there
