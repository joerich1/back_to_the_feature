EXT PARIS -- AFTERNOON

Delerues theme from Antoine and Colette plays over an
opening credit sequence consisting of a series of images of
Paris Each shot is composition of the streets landmarks
and the minute details of this beautiful August afternoon
The last shot begins wide on the Shakespeare Bookstore and
closes in on a sign in the window announcing an event

Jesse Wallace young author of the acclaimed best-seller
THIS TIME Saturday August 23 A brooding picture of Jesse
is prominent Over the image we hear a French Journalist
asking a question

FRENCH JOURNALIST 1 (0S)
Do you consider the book to be
autobiographical

INT SHAKESPEARE BOOKSTORE -- AFTERNOON

Inside this funky bookstore JESSE early 30s is sitting
casually with a few journalists and patrons

JESSE

Isnt everything autobiographical I
mean we all see the world from our
own tiny keyhole I always think of
Thomas Wolfe - have you ever seen
that little one page ‘note to reader’
in the front of Look Homeward Angel
Do you know what Im talking about

Vague affirmatives

JESSE (CONTD)
Anyway He says how we are the sum
of all the moments of our lives
that anybody who writes will use the
clay of their lives that you cant
avoid that I remember he says he
cant imagine anything more
autobiographical then Gullivers
Travels

INTEXT BEFORE SUNRISE MONTAGE

Over the next section of dialog we see an approximately 90
second series of shots from BEFORE SUNRISE that silently
tell the story boy meets girl on a train boy and girl get
to know one another boy and girl kiss get more intimate
part at dawn

JESSE (0S)
When I look at my life I have to
admit Ive never been around a bunch

OF

Pink Pages 243803

JESSE (0S) (CONTD)
of guns or violence a helicopter
erash political intrigue But my
life from my point of view has
been full of drama And one of the
most exciting things thats ever
happened to me is actually connecting
with another person and I thought if
I could write a book that could
capture that make that connection
valuable that possibilityanyway
that was the attempt I dont know
if that answers your question

FRENCH JOURNALIST 1
Ill be more specific Was there
ever a young French woman on a train
you met and spent an evening with

JESSE
See to me thats not important

FRENCH JOURNALIST 2
So thats a yes

JESSE
Okay since this is the last stop
of my book tour and I am in France
Yes

Were now near the end of the montage where Celine and Jesse

say their good-byes at the train station and are soon

traveling alone

FRENCH JOURNALIST 1
The book ends on an ambiguous note -
we dont know Do you think they
get back together in six months like
they promised each other

JESSE
I think how you answer that is a
good test as to whether you are a
romantic or a cynic -

He looks at the journalists and points at each of them as he

speaks

OF ee OF
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE (CONTD)
You think they get back together
you dont you hope they do but arent
sure

FRENCH JOURNALIST 1
But do YOU think they do Did you
in real life

JESSE
Well in the words of my grandfather
to answer that would take the piss
outta the whole thing

Still offscreen the Bookstore Manager chimes in

MANAGER (0S)
We have time for one last question

INT SHAKESPEARE BOOKSTORE AFTERNOON
Were now back inside

FRENCH JOURNALIST 2
What is your next book

JESSE
Ive always wanted to write a book
where the whole thing happens within
the space of one pop song

FRENCH JOURNALIST 1
What song

JESSE
I dont know havent written it yet -
The Long and Winding Road maybe
The storys about this guy living in
Miami at his in-laws beach house
and hes totally depressed His
great dream was to be an adventurer
a lover riding motorcycles through
South America But instead he
sitting at this marble table eating
lobster Hes got a job a beautiful
wife all that he needs but none of
it matters - what he wants is to
fight for meaning

Across the room CELINE emerges from behind a row of books

where shes been hiding and listening

JESSE (CONTD)
Happiness is in the doing right
not getting what you want
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE (CONTD)
And just that second his five year-
old daughter jumps up on the table
He knows she shouldnt be there
she could get hurt But she is
dancing to this pop song in a summer
dress

Celine is looking at him

JESSE (CONTD)
All of sudden hes 16 and his high-
school sweetheart is dropping him
off at home They just lost their
virginity and she loves him and the
same song is playing on the car radio
and she climbs up dancing on the
roof of the car And now hes worried
about her Shes beautiful with a
facial expression just like his
daughter Maybe thats why he likes
her He knows he is not REMEMBERING
this dance He is there - he is
there in both moments simultaneously
In fact he pulls away from a kiss
with the girlfriend so as to not
offend his daughter Both moments
are real happening together For a
moment all his life is folding in
and its obvious to him that time is
a lie

He looks up and sees Celine for the first time

He takes a beat still looking at Celine not sure what to

do next

JESSE (CONTD)
Its all happening all the time and
inside every moment is another all
happening simultaneously

JESSE (CONTD)
Anyway thats kinda the idea anyway

MANAGER
Our author needs to be going to the
airport soon Id like to thank all
of you for coming over this afternoon
and especially like to thank Mr
Wallace for being with us We hope
to see you again with your next book
So everyone please help yourselves
to champagne and cookies
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 5

There is polite applause and people start to disperse Jesse
looks back over to Celine - she gives a little wave He
gets the managers attention

JESSE
(to Manager)
How long till I have to leave here
for the airport

MANAGER
You should leave about 715 or so
730 at the latest

JESSE
Okay

Jesse walks over to Celine

JESSE (CONTD)
Hi

CELINE
Hello

A slightly awkward double cheek kiss

JESSE

CELINE

JESSE

something

CELINE
Didnt he just say you have a plane
to catch

JESSE

CELINE

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 6

MANAGER (CONTD)
Well get your bags in the car so

JESSE
Okay Thanks for everything

As they start to exit the store Jesse is detained briefly
signing a book getting the card from the driver etc Celine
exits in front of him

EXT WALK FROM BOOKSTORE -- AFTERNOON

Outside the bookstore Jesse puts his hands on Celines
shoulders and just looks at her

JESSE
I cant believe youre here

CELINE
I live here in Paris Are you sure

JESSE

JESSE

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
Theres one a little further that I
like a lot

JESSE
Alright

They start walking

JESSE (CONTD)
I thought I was going to totally
lose it in there after I saw you
Howd you even know I was going to
be here

CELINE
Its my favorite bookstore in Paris
You can sit down for hours I love
it - even if theres fleas

JESSE
I think a cat slept on my head last
night

CELINE
I saw your picture on the calendar
about a month ago and that you were
going to be here Its funny I read
an article on your book and it sounded
vaguely familiar but I didnt put
it all together until I saw the photo

JESSE
Did you have a chance to read it

CELINE
Yes I was really surprised as you
can imagine
(a beat)
I had to read it twice actually

Jesse just looks at her

JESSE
Comme ci comme ca

CELINE
No I really like it - its romantic
I usually dont like that but its
well written Congratulations

JESSE
Thanks

Celine suddenly stops and looks at Jesse
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
But before we go anywhere I have to
ask you did you show up in Vienna
that December

JESSE
Did you

TA
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
I couldnt but did you I have to
know Its important to me

JESSE
(playful)

Why if you didnt

CELINE
Did you

JESSE
No

CELINE

Oh thank God you didnt

JESSE
Yeah thank God you didnt either
If one of us would have been there
alone it would have sucked

They continue walking

CELINE
IT know I was so concerned with that
Ive always felt horrible about not
being there but I couldnt my grandma
died a few days before and she was
buried that day December 16th

JESSE
(almost relieved)
She died The one in Budapest

CELINE
How did you remember that

JESSE
I remember everything

CELINE
Oh of course it was in your book
Anyway I was just about to fly to
Vienna to meet you when we got the
news about her then of course I
went to the funeral with my parents

JESSE
Im so sorry to hear that
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

They

CELINE
But you werent there anyway
(suddenly suspicious)
Wait why werent you there I
would have been there if I could
have - I had made plans You better
have a good reason

slow to a stop and just look at each other

hes been lying

CELINE (CONTD)
Oh no You were there weren’t you

JESSE
(down)
Yeah

CELINE
Ahhhh Thats terrible Im so
sorry Im laughing but I dont
mean it Did you hate me You must
have hated me
(a beat)
Have you hated me all this time

JESSE
No

CELINE
Yes you have but you cant hate me
now

JESSE
No I dont hate you Cmon no
big deal I flew over there you
blew the whole thing off I gave up
on love and my lifes been a big
nose-dive since then but hey no
big deal

CELINE
No

JESSE
Im kidding

CELINE

I can’t believe it You must have
felt really angry with me Im so
sorry - I wanted to be there more
than anything in the world But you
cant be angry anymore I mean my
grand-ma--

She realizes
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

JESSE
Honestly I had a feeling something
like that might have happened I
was bummed but I was mostly just
mad that we hadnt exchanged phone
numbers or any information

CELINE
I know that was so stupid - no way
to get in touch I didnt even know
your last name

JESSE
I know We had nothing to go on

CELINE
I was cursing - If I could just

reach him

JESSE
I know remember the reason we did
thatwe were both afraid if we
started calling and writing it would
slowly fade away

CELINE
It definitely wasnt a slow fade

JESSE
Sure wasnt

CELINE
Yes we wanted to pick it up where
we left off which would have been a
good idea if

JESSE
(butting in)
If itd just worked Oh well

CELINE
So how long were you in Vienna

JESSE
Couple of days

CELINE
Did you meet another girl

JESSE
Yeah her name was Gretchen she was
awesome The books actually a
composite of the two of you

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
Really
JESSE
No I even went back to the train

station and put up a sign that had
the number to my hotel just in case
you had been delayed a half day or
something total dork

CELINE
Did you get any calls

JESSE
Just a couple of hookers looking for
a gig
(a beat)
Hey it was awful what do you want
mé to say

CELINE
Oh thats so sad Im so sorry

They start walking again

JESSE
Then I just walked around for a while
then eventually flew back home I
owed my dad two grand who had warned
me about French chicks

CELINE
What did he tell you about French
women

JESSE

Nothing lots of crap Hes never
been with any French women I dont
think hes ever been east of the
Mississippi

CELINE
Why didnt you put the six months
later part in the book

JESSE
But I did

CELINE
Really

JESSE

I wrote a fictional version where
you do show up

CELINE
You did What happens
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE
Oh we make love for like ten days
straight

11A
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
Thats interesting

JESSE
And then they find out more about
each other and realize they dont
really get along

CELINE
I like that Its more real

JESSE
My editor didnt feel that way

CELINE
Yes everybody wants to believe in
love It sells

JESSE
Yep

CELINE
But things are going well for you
right

(pause)
Your books a bestseller in the US

JESSE
Its a tiny bestseller but
officially yes But hey most people
havent read Moby Dick so why the
hell should they read my book

CELINE
I never read Moby Dick but I liked
your book even though I thought
you idealized our night a bit

JESSE
Hey its fiction

CELINE
I know but I thought there wete
times when you made me I mean her
no me like sometimes shes was a
bit psychotic

JESSE

But you are a little like that
CELINE

I know Whatil
JESSE

Just kidding No really whered I
do that

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
Maybe its just meIt was so strange
to be reading something knowing the
character in the story is based on
you Its both flattering and
disturbing at the same time

JESSE
Why was it disturbing

CELINE
I dont know just -being part of
someones memory suddenly seeing
myself through your eyes How long
did it take you to write it

JESSE
3 or 4 years

Fh
Hh

On and o

CELINE
Its a long time to be writing about
one night

JESSE
Tell me about it I feel like I
basically lived with you there for a
while

CELINE
Id always assumed youve forgotten
me

JESSE
I had a pretty clear picture of you
in my mind I gotta tell you
something - Ive wanted to talk to
you for so long

CELINE
Me too

JESSE
Its surreal now I feel everything
I say should be

CELINE
Yeah and now we have what twenty
minutes and thirty seconds

JESSE
More than that much more than that
I want to know about you What are
you up to

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 13A

CELINE
Wheew Where to start Im working
for Green Cross its an environmental
organization
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE
Wow What are they all about

CELINE
We basically work on many different
environment issues from clean water
to disarmament of chemical weapons
you know international laws that
deal with the environment

JESSE
What do you do for them

CELINE
Different things Last year I was
in India for quite a while working
on a water treatment plant

JESSE
Wow

CELINE
The cotton industry there is a major
source of pollution

JESSE
I gotta say I admire the fact that
it sounds like you are actually DOING
something Most people myself
included just bitch about everything
how Americas consuming all the
worlds resources were creating
sweat shops in China SUVs suck
global warming

CELINE
Im relived to hear youre not one
of those Freedom Fry kind of
Americans

JESSE
Nah But I gotta say I think thats
so cool what youre doing Howd
you get into that

CELINE
When Icame out of political science
I thought Id be working for the
government and I did for a short
while and then I got tired of having
conversations with friends about how
the world was falling to pieces

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE (CONTD)
I realized that the only thing I
wanted to do was to look at things
that really can be fixed and try to
fix them

14A
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

He laughs

They both

JESSE
I gotta say thats awesome I always
figured youd be doing something
cool like that

CELINE
Thanks Im lucky to have a job I
really like

JESSE
You know I actually alternate in
thinking that everything is
irrevocably screwed up and actually
feeling things in a general might be
getting better

CELINE
Better How could you possibly think
that

JESSE
I know it sounds weird but I think
there are things to be optimistic
about

CELINE
(interrupting)
Okay I know your book is selling
but what are you talking about - the
worlds a mess right now

CELINE (CONTD)
From a western point of view things
are getting a bit better - were
moving all our industry to developing
nations to get cheap labor free from
any environmental laws The weapons
industry is out of control five
million die every year due to
preventable water diseases So how
is the world getting better Im
not getting angry but really I want
to know

JESSE
I know there are a lot of serious
problems - I dont have one publisher
in the entire Asian market

laugh approaching the cafe

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 15A

JESSE (CONTD)
But I think theres more awareness
out there

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

INT CAFE

They walk

JESSE (CONTD)
It might be getting better because
people like you are informed and
educated and speaking out and as the
worlds consciousness and education
rises - things like womens issues
racial rights sexual rights
childrens rights

CELINE
I know

JESSE
I mean the very notion of conservation
and environmental issues - all that
werent even in the vocabulary until
fairly recently - those are becoming
the norm and will eventually be whats
expected all over the world

CELINE
I agree with what you are saying but
its dangerous An imperialist
country can use that kind of thinking
to justify their economic greed
Human rights is the only issue I

-- AFTERNOON
in and eventually seat themselves

JESSE
Any particular imperialist country
you got in mind there Frency

CELINE
No not really Is it okay if we
sit here

JESSE
Perfect But what Im really saying
is the world might be evolving like
a person evolves ME for example
Am I improving Am I getting worse
When I was younger I was healthier
but I was racked with insecurity-
Now Im older my problems are deeper
but Im more equipped to handle them

CELINE
What are your problems

Long Pause

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE
Right now I dont feel like I have
any - just damn happy to be here

CELINE

Me too How long have you been in
Paris

JESSE
Got in last night Ive done ten
cities in twelve days - Im so glad
its over Im so sick of being a
huckster

The waitress comes over to the table

WAITRESS
Bonjour Vous dinner

CELINE
What do you want

JESSE
Just a coffee

CELINE
Non un cafe et une orange pressee
avec des glacons

JESSE
I love the coffee over here so much
more than in the US

CELINE
I couldnt even drink coffee when I
was living over there

JESSE
You lived in the US When
CELINE
From 96 through 99 I was studying
at NYU
JESSE
Dont tell me that
CELINE
What
JESSE

Oh wow - that’s weird Ive been in
New York since 98 Thats wild -
we were both there at the same time
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
That is weird You know it actually
crossed my mind if I might run into
you there but the odds are so slim
you know I had no idea even what
town you were living in Werent
you somewhere in Texas

JESSE
I was for a long time but I had to
get out there I figured it was
time for me to be in New York What
made you come back here

CELINE
I had finished my masters for one
but I was starting to get paranoid
The stuff in the medias all the time -
murders gang violence serial
killers

JESSE
I know

CELINE
I was living in terror The final
straw was one night I heard some
noise on my fire escape I called
911 and the cops came

JESSE

Like three hours later

CELINE

After Id been raped and killed about
ten times It was a man and a woman
officer I was describing to them
what I had heard when the woman had
to run downstairs to move the police
car I was alone with the male cop
and right away he asked me if I had
a gun I said no and he told me Id
better think about getting one -
this was America not France I
told him I didnt know how to shoot
a gun and that I wasnt interested
in firearms That is when he pulled
out his gun and said to me

(cop voice)
One day youre going to have
something like this in your face
and if you want to live a long life
youre going to have to choose between
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE (CONTD)
you or them They left and the
next morning I actually called for
an application to get a gun Me a
gun But then I started thinking
that something was wrong the way
that cop had pulled his gun

JESSE
Yeah sure

CELINE
So I canceled my demand for a gun
and instead I called the police
station and tried to complain about
this cops behavior

JESSE -
What happened with that

CELINE
It was so much paper work and with
my shitty student visa so I gave up
and forgot about the whole thing
Well actually no I never forgot

JESSE
Obviously

Coffee arrives

CELINE
But still I wouldnt mind being
back there - theres a lot of things
I miss about the US

JESSE
Like what

CELINE
The overall good mood people have
even if it can be bullshit Like
hey how you doing Great How
YOU doin Great Have a great day
Parisians are so grumpy Have you
noticed

JESSE
Really Everyone around here seems
pretty happy to me

CELINE
Theyre not happy Maybe I just
mean the French men they drive me
nuts

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 19A

JESSE
What about them
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
You know French guys like wine and
food theyre fun maybe its just
me bad luck but there not that

JESSE
What

19B
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
Whats the word horny

JESSE
In that regard Im proud to be an
merican

CELINE
And you should be - in that regard
only Have you ever spent any time
in Eastern Europe

JESSE
No

CELINE
I remember as a teenager I went to
Warsaw when it was still a strict
communist regime which I dont
approve of at all

JESSE
Sure you dont

CELINE
I dont at all really But something
about being there after a while was
very interesting I found After a
couple of weeks something changed in
me The city was quite gloomy and
gray but after a while my brain seemed
clearer I was writing a lot more
in my journal ideas I had never
thought of before

JESSE
Communist ideas

CELINE
Shut up Im not a communist

JESSE
I know Go ahead sorry

CELINE
It took me a while to figure out
why why I felt so different And
then one day as I was walking throvgh
the Jewish cemetery I dont know
why but it occurred to me there
I realized I had just spent the past
couple of weeks away from most of my
habits The TV was in a language I
didnt understand and there was
nothing to buy no advertisements
anywhere

(MORE)

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE (CONTD)
So all I had been doing for three
weeks was walk around write think
My brain felt like it was at rest
free from the consuming frenzy and I
have to say it was almost like a
natural high

20A
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 20B

CELINE (CONTD)
I was so peaceful inside no strange
urges to be somewhere else to shop
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE (CONTD)
Maybe it could have seemed like
boredom at first but it quickly it
became very soulful

JESSE
Can you believe it was nine years
ago we were walking around Vienna

CELINE
No thats impossible
JESSE
Feels like two months ago but
June of 94
CELINE
Do I look any different
JESSE
Mmmmm Your hair was down back then

can you

She undoes her hair Jesse keeps looking at her

JESSE (CONTD)
Little skinnier I think

CELINE
Was I fat before

JESSE
No no

CELINE

You thought I was a fatty You wrote
a book about a fat girl

They both laugh
JESSE

No seriously - you look beautiful
Do I look any different

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
No you have this little line here
r She points to the wrinkle between his eyebrows
JESSE
I know I know
CELINE
Like a scar
JESSE -

A scar Like a gunshot wound

CELINE
No I like it I had a terrible
nightmare the other day I was having
an awful dream that I was 32 then I
woke up and I was 23 relieved and
then I woke up for real and I was

JESSE
Aw shit it happens

CELINE
Time gets faster and faster
Apparently its because we dont

renew our synapses after 20 so its
all pretty much downhill from then
on
JESSE

On the other hand I like getting
older Life feels more immediate -
You can appreciate it more

CELINE

Oh I know I actually like it too
JESSE

I was once a drummer in a band
CELINE

You were
JESSE

And we were pretty good too But
the lead singer was so obsessed with
us getting signed We spent all our
time thinking about getting bigger
gigs- all about the future And now
the band doesnt even exist anymore
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 22A

JESSE (CONTD)
But looking back at those shows we
did even rehersing it was so much
fun
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE (CONTD)
I think now Id be able to enjoy
every minute of it

CELINE
Well youve got your book published
and youre travelling all over the

They laugh

world with it are you enjoying
it

JESSE
Not really

CELINE

You know in my field I see some
people that come into it like with
big idealist visions of becoming
the new leaders that will create a
better world they enjoy the goal
but not the process

JESSE
Right

CELINE
But the reality of it is that the
true work of improving things is in
the little achievements of the day
and thats what you need to enjoy to
stay in that field For example I
worked for an organization that helped
villages in Mexico and their concerns
was how to get the pencils sent to
the kids in those little country
schools it was not about discussing
big revolutionary ideas about a better
world - it was about pencils I see
the people that do the real work
and what in a way is really sad is
that the people that are often the
most giving hard working and capable
of making this world better dont
really have the ambition and ego to
be a leader they dont see any
interest in the rewards they dont
care if their name ever appear in
the press they actually enjoy the
process of helping others they are
truly in the moment

JESSE
Yeah thats such a struggle
(MORE)

too OF
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 23A

JESSE (CONTD)
It seems like were designed to be
slightly dis-contented with
everything Always trying to better
our situation You satisfy one desire
and it just agitates another But
then I think well desire is the
fuel of life Do you think it’s
true that wed never be unhappy if
we never wanted anything
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
I dont know actually Not wanting
anything Isnt it a symptom of
depression Its very human to
desire

JESSE
Thats what all those Buddhist cats
say right liberate yourself from
desire and you will find you already
have everything you need

CELINE
But I feel human when I want something
more than just basic survival needs
Wanting whether its intimacy with
another person or a new pair of shoes
is kind of beautiful I like that
we have ever-renewing desires

JESSE
Yeah I guess its just entitlement
that brings all the pain Whenever
you feel you deserve that pair of
shoes that your desires SHOULD be
met Its all right to have wants
and needs as long as you dont get
angry when theyre not realized
Life is hard its supposed to be
if we didnt suffer we would never
learn a thing

CELINE
So what are you like a Buddhist or
something
JESSE
No
CELINE
Why not
JESSE

I dont know its probably like
when I go to a museum I dont get
the headphones with the guided tour
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
I know I decided a long time ago
that I wanted be open to everything
but not buy into any one belief
system

JESSE
I like that I went to this Trappist
monastery couple years ago

CELINE
Trappist

Catholic Cistertian

CELINE
Why did you go there

JESSE
I dont know Id been doing a bunch
of reading thought itd be cool
Have you ever spent time with any
monks or nuns

CELINE
Not my style

JESSE
I was shocked I expected them to
be all glowering and stern but they
werent they were quick to laugh
and really easy to be around very
attuned to everything Theyre not
trying to hustle anybody theyre
not trying to accomplish anything
they are trying to live and die in
peace and be close with God or
whatever part of them they feel is
eternal - its so refreshing to be
around You realize that the bulk
of people that you meet are trying
to get somewhere better make a little
more jack get a little more respect

have more people admire them its
exhausting

CELINE
No kidding

JESSE

And its exhausting to be one of
those people yourself

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE (CONTD)
Im at a monastery greedy to be a
little more spiritual I want to be
a better person You cant escape

CELINE
I had a boyfriend many years ago
that wanted to be a Buddist and he
went to Asia to visit several
monasteries He was very good looking
and everytime he went to one of those
monasteries a monk offered to suck
his cock

They laugh

He laughs

JESSE
Well it all comes down to that

doesnt it Thats why I think I
really admire what youre doing

CELINE
You mean sucking Cock

JESSE
No Im just saying it sounds like
youre not detached from the world
Youre putting your life and passion
into tangible action

CELINE
Im just doing my best
JESSE
You know something
CELINE
What
JESSE

Im going to be sitting down on a
plane and in airports for the next
eight hours or something Would you
mind walking around with me a little
bit

CELINE
Are you inviting me

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 27

JESSE
Yes lets go

They stand up He glances at the bill and takes out a five
Euro note

JESSE (CONTD)
Is this enough Even for a tip

CELINE

Yep

They start walking out

JESSE

Anywhere to walk to around here
CELINE

Its sales day today
JESSE

Whats that
CELINE

Its when everything is on sale in
Paris Twice a year

JESSE
Then lets go shopping

CELINE
No no no I dont want to inflict
that on you - its madness Lets
go up to the garden path - its a
nice way back

JESSE
That sounds better than shopping
actually not that I wasnt up for
doing anything you wanted

EXT STREET -- AFTERNOON
They are walking approaching the garden path
CELINE
Sometimes I can get high on just

looking and trying on things I dont
even need to buy

JESSE
A therapist would tell you its all
good

CELINE

Are you ever in therapy

ee OF
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 27K

JESSE
Does it seem like Im in therapy
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
tT dont know - has it helped your
sex problems

JESSE
(wide eyed)
Sex problems

CELINE
No Im kidding

EXT GARDEN PATH STAIRWAY -- AFTERNOON
They continue their walktalk
JESSE
No no tell me the truth Did we

have problems that night

CELINE
I was kidding We didnt even have
sex anyway

JESSE
What Thats a joke right
CELINE
No we didnt That was the whole
thing
JESSE

Of course we did

CELINE
But we didnt You didnt have a
condom and I never have sex without
one especially if it was a one night
thing Im extremely paranoid about
my health

JESSE
Im finding this very scary that you
dont remember what happened

CELINE
You know what I didnt write an
entire book but I kept a journal
and I wrote the whole night in it
Thats what I meant by you idealizing
the night

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

JESSE
(a bit louder)
I even remember the brand of condom
I used

CELINE
Thats disgusting

Walking by are an older couple with three kids They look
back a bit shocked

JESSE
No it isnt

CELINE
Alright when I get home Ill check
my journal from 94 but I know Im
right
(a beat)
Wait a minute Was it in the
cemetery

JESSE
Noooo We visited the cemetery during
the day It was in a park very
late at night

CELINE
Wait a minute

JESSE
Was it that forgettable You dont
remember in the park

CELINE
Wait a minute I think you might be
right

JESSE

Youre messing with me

CELINE
Sorry no youre right Its strange
sometimes its like I put things in
drawers inside my head and forget
about it
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE (CONTD)
I guess it is less painful to put
certain things away than to live
with it

JESSE
So that night was a sad memory for
you

CELINE
I didn’t mean that night in
particular I meant that certain
things are better off forgotten

JESSE
God I remember that night better
than entire years

CELINE
Me too I mean I thought I did
Maybe I put it away because of the
fact that my Grandmothers funeral
was the day we were supposed to
meet again

JESSE
It was a bad day for me but it
mustve been even worse for you

CELINE
Yeah it was unreal I looked at her
dead body in the coffin I looked at
her hands that used to hold me so
warm so sweet but nothing in that
coffin resembled what I remembered
of her All the warmth was gone I
was crying looking at her so confused
about if I was crying because I was
never going to see her again or never
going to see you again Sorry to go
on like this but Ive been a little
down this week

JESSE
Why

CELINE
Forget it nothing bad reading your
book maybe Thinking of how hopeful
I was that summer and fall and since
then its kind of I dont know
memory is a wonderful thing it you
dont have to deal the past

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803
He laughs

JESSE
Can I make a bumper sticker out of
that MEMORY IS A WONDERFUL THING
IF YOU DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH PAST
If you wrote a book about our night
that could be the title

CELINE
Yes I guess it would have been a
different book

JESSE
It wouldnt have a sex scene

CELINE
But you know what - now that weve
met again we can change our memory
of Dec 16th - it no longer has that
sad ending of us never seeing each
other again

JESSE
Yeah a memorys never finished if
you really think about it

CELINE
Yes I know I have memories from my
childhood that I realized more
recently never really happened My
mom was so paranoid when I was eight
or nine she was always warning me
when I walked home at night from my
piano lesson about dirty old men
giving me candies and showing me
their pee-pees

Jesse laughs

CELINE (CONTD)
As I got older I had this image in
my head that this had really happened
To the point that I associated sex
with that walk home And now
sometimes when I am having sex I see
myself walking down that street

JESSE
Is that street nearby

They laugh
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
Did you ever keep a journal as a
kid

JESSE
Yeah I started when I was about
thirteen

CELINE

Me too Its funny I read mine from
83 the other day What really
surprised me is that I was dealing
with life the same way I am now I
was much more naive and hopeful but
the core and the way I was feeling
things is exactly the same as it is
now I havent changed much at all

JESSE
I dont think anyone does No one
wants to admit it but its like we
have these innate set points and
nothing much is going to change our
general disposition

CELINE
Do you believe that

JESSE
The older I get I think maybe so
I read about this study where they
followed people that had won the
lottery and people whod become
paraplegics Were led to believe
one would make us euphoric and the
other suicidal The study showed
that within about six months once
theyd more or less gotten used to
their new situation they were
fundamentally the same as they were
before

CELINE
The same

JESSE
Yeah if they were basically an
optimistic jovial person they were
an optimistic jovial person in a
wheelchair If they were a petty
miserable person they were now a
petty miserable person with a new
house Cadillac and boat

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 32A

CELINE
You mean Ill be forever depressed
no matter what great things happen
in my life
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

He laughs

JESSE
Definitely Are you depressed now

CELINE
No Im not depressed but I worry
Tll get to the end of my life feeling
I havent done all I wanted to do

JESSE
What do you want to do

CELINE
I mean I want to paint write more
songs learn Chinese play my guitar
each day There are so many things
that I want to do and I end up doing
not much

JESSE
Well let me ask you this do you
believe in ghosts or spirits

CELINE
No
JESSE
Do you believe in re-incarnation
CELINE
Not at all
JESSE

What about God

CELINE
No no

Jesse laughs

CELINE (CONTD)
But at the same time I dont want
to be one of those people that dont
believe in any kind of magic

JESSE
So you believe in Astrology

CELINE
Of course I mean your a Scorpio
Im a Sag we get along No Theres
that Einstein quote that if you dont
believe in any kind of magic or
mystery youre as good as dead

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 33A

JESSE
Yeah Ive always felt there was
some kind of mystical core to the
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 33B

JESSE (CONTD)
universe But I dont believe that
me my personality has any permanent
place here And the more I believe
that the more I cant go through
life and think This is no big deal”
This is it What do you see What
do you feel What do you think is
funny Every day is the last
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE

And sometimes when I feel that way I
call my mom and I tell her I love
her shes always

(imitating mother)
Oh my God whats wrong Youve
got cancer Youre going to commit
suicide Its almost not worth it

Jesse laughs

CELINE (CONTD)
So what about us

JESSE
What about us

CELINE
For example if we knew we were both
going to die tonight

JESSE
Like the apocalypse was coming

CELINE
No thats too dramatic Just the
two of us would die would we talk
about your book the environment or
like tell me what you would you say

JESSE
If today was our last day

CELINE
Thats hard no

JESSE
I would definitely stop talking about
my book probably drop the
environment

CELINE
Okay

JESSE
I wouldnt mind still talking about
magic in the universe Id just like
to do it in a hotel room in between
sessions of us like wildly fucking
till we die

CELINE
Wow Why not just go over to that
bench right there Why waste time
going to a hotel
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 34A

He immediately grabs her and pulls over to a bench He twirls
her into his lap as she is suddenly overcome with shyness

CELINE (CONTD)
Well were most likely not gonna
die tonight

JESSE
Too bad
Before Sunrise Sequel Yellow Pages 20803 34B

She repositions herself on the bench next to him
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
Forget about the hotel or the park
bench

JESSE
Well lets not forget about it

CELINE
That was an extreme example but my
point was to communicate with people
is very hard to do

JESSE
Yeah most of our day to day
exchanges if you think about it
theyre more like traffic control

CELINE
I know For example a friend of
mine was talking about she and her
boyfriends problems in bed After
they had dated for about a year she
started telling him things he could
do to please her and it totally
freaked him out

JESSE
Why

CELINE
He thought it meant he was a bad
lover and was all threatened they
almost broke up over it

JESSE
Whyd she wait so long

CELINE
I dont know men are so easily
offended

JESSE
More than women you think

CELINE
Definitely on that subject Plus I
think it is easier to please a man
than to please a woman

JESSE
Its definitely easier to please a
man

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
Depends but generally yes Can you
name the female mammal that has
opposing thumbs and is been observed
in the wild te be actively encouraging
males of the same species to lick
its genitalia

JESSE
No like a baboon or something
What

Celine gives a crazed look and points her two thumbs at
herself letting out a little primate shriek They both
laugh

35A
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
The good thing about getting older
is that I dont get wiser I just get
dirtier

JESSE
No shame in that

CELINE
Anyway my friend said the next man
she dates before they ever do
anything shes going to make a
questionnaire about sex - what each
of them likes and dislikes

JESSE
Is it on paper or do you answer out
loud

CELINE
Mostly written down I think but
not just yes or no Like if the
question is are you into S and M you
can answer no but a spanking once
in a while doesnt hurt

Jesse laughs

She looks

JESSE
Or it could be like do you like
dirty talk during sex

CELINE
Or it could be like which specific
words do you want to hear or not

at him

JESSE
Me

CELINE
Okay Which words do you like to
hear

JESSE
I dont know

CELINE
For instance how do you feel about
the word pussy

JESSE
Love it

Before Sunrise Sequei Pink Pages 24803
They both laugh

CELINE
Its amazing what perverts weve
both become in the last 9 years

JESSE
At least now we dont have to pretend
that each sexual experience is some
life-altering event

CELINE
Yeah - by this time I know youve
stuck it in so many places its
probably like about to fall off
right

JESSE
Exactly and I cant realistically
expect youre anything but a total
ho at this point so

CELINE
Thats true what can you do

JESSE
Nothing
(a beat)
So tell me what kind of songs do
you write

CELINE
What kind

JESSE
Yeah what are they like

CELINE
I dont know Some are about people
relationships one’s about my cat

JESSE
Sing me one

CELINE
No I dont have my guitar

JESSE
Cmon Acapella

CELINE
No way not right now
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

They walk

JESSE
If not now when

Celine starts to get up with Jesse eventually following

CELINE
Thats right we need to get going
back to the bookstore - youre going
to miss your flight

JESSE
ITil be fine

CELINE
This will take us to the Seine
Then we can just walk from there

JESSE
Okay okay

CELINE
So youre flying back to New York

JESSE
Yeah

in silence for a bit
CELINE

So I read in that article you are
married and have a kid Thats great

A slightly weird look from Jesse knew this coming
eventually

JESSE
Yeah Hes four - can you believe
it

CELINE

Whats his name

JESSE
Henry Hank hes amazing Its
so much fun -

CELINE
Im sure And your wife What does
she do

JESSE
UmmmShe teaches elementary school
You dont have children do you

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 38A

CELINE
Oh Shit
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 38B

CELINE (CONTD)
I left them in the car with the
windows up But it was six months
) ago - do you think theyre okay

They laugh
CELINE (CONTD)

IT want to some day but Im not ready
Im in a good relationship though
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

JESSE
Yeah Thats nice Whats he like

CELINE
Hes great - hes a photo-journalist
and he does war coverage Hes away
a lot which leaves me free to do a
lot of things

JESSE
Isnt that dangerous Seems like a
lot of those guys are getting killed
these days

CELINE
He promises me he never takes risks
but I often worry He goes into

this trance when he starts to
photograph something

JESS
What do you mean

CELINE
Once we were in New Delhi and we
passed a bum lying in the middle of
the sidewalk

JESSE
Bomb
CELINE
Bum homeless It looked like he

needed help but his first reaction
was to photograph him He took a
picture very close to his face

even fixing his collar to make it
look better He was totally detached
from the person

JESSE
Well to be good at that job Id
think youd have to be like that

CELINE
Maybe I dont judge him for it -
what he does is essential and
incredible All Im saying is that
I could never do it

They are approaching the Seine

JESSE
Hey lets go get on that boat
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
You dont have time

JESSE
Come on itll fun I really want
to We still have fifteen minutes
Do you have a cell phone

39A
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
Yeah

JESSE
Tll call him from the boat and he
can pick me up at the next stop
That way we wont lose any time

CELINE
OK if you want to-- Ive never
peen on these boats its for
tourists Its a bit embarassing
Oh well

They speed up to get on the boat before it leaves

JESSE

So what you in love with this guy
CELINE

What guy
JESSE

The photo journalist

CELINE
Yeah of course Well probably

EXT BOAT -- AFTERNOON

They get on the boat and pay Celine asks the guy about
where the boat stops next

CELINE
Bonjour deux ticket sil vous plait
crest quoi le prochain arret

BOAT GUY
Quai Henri IV Mademoiselle
CELINE
Tell him to pick you up at quai Henri
Iv
JESSE
Arri cat
CELINE
Quai Henri IV
JESSE
An-Ri-cat
CELINE

Henri 1V
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803
JESSE
Oh like Henry 4
CELINE
Yes
JESSE

Why didnt you say so

40A

Jesse makes his call while Celine walks to the back of the

boat

wind blowing

Eventually they stand on the back of the boat
as Notre Dame looms in the background

JESSE (CONTD)
Notre Dame check that out I heard
a story once that when the Germans
were occupying Paris and they had to
retreat back they wired Notre Dame
to blow up and they had to leave one
guy in charge of hitting the switch
But the guy the soldier just waited
sitting there and he just couldnt
do it When the allied troops
eventually came in they found all
the explosives and the switch just
lying there They found the same
thing at Sacre-Coeur the Eiffel
Tower and two other places think
I always liked that story

the
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE
Yes that is a great story But you
have to think that one day Notre
Dame will be gone There used to be
another Cathedral there

JESSE
Right where Notre Dame is

CELINE
Yeah Everything passes People
buildings You know what Ive
never done this I forget about how
beautiful Paris is Sometimes when

you live in a city you dont even
look at it anymore

JESSE
Yeah I think my book was like
building something so I wouldnt
forget the details of the time we
spent together Like a reminder
that once we really did meet this
was real this happened

CELINE

You know Im happy you are saying
that I mean I always feel like a
freak because Im never able to move
on like this

(snap her fingers) )
People just have an affair or even a
relationship they break up and they
forget they move on like they would
have changed brand of cereals I
feel I was never able to really forget
anyone Ive been with because each
person has their own specific
qualities and you can never replace
anyone what is lost is lost Each
relationship when it ends really
damages me I never really recover
That is why Im very careful with
getting involved because it hurts me
too muchor even getting laid
actually I dont do that I will
miss of the person the most mundane
things Like Im obsessed with little
things

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE (CONTD)
Maybe Im crazy when I was a little
girl my mom told me I was always
late to school so one day she
followed me to see why I was late
I was looking at chestnuts falling
from the trees and rolling down the
side walk or ants crossing the road
the way a leaf cast a shadow on a
tree trunk little things It is
the same with people I see in them
little details so specific to each
of them that move me that I miss
and will always miss You can never
replace anyone because everyone is
made of such beautiful specific
details

Pause

CELINE (CONTD)
You know like I remember the way
your beard had a bit of red in it
and the way the sun was making it
glow in the morning right before you
left I missed that Shit Im really
crazy

JESSE
Now I know for sure why I wrote that
stupid book - so you might actually
show up at a reading in Paris and
Id walk over to you and ask hey
WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU

Celine laughs

CELINE
Honestly did you think Id be here
today

JESSE

Im not kidding - I think I wrote it
to try and find you somehow

CELINE
I know its not true but that is
Sweet to say

JESSE
I think it is true What did you
think the changes were of us seeing
each other again

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
After that December Id say almost
zero but were not real anyway We
are just characters in that old ladys
dream - shes on her deathbed and
she is fantasizing about her youth
so of course we had to meet again

Jesse then speaks in a voice that is both louder and more
frustrated and desperate than weve seen

JESSE
God why werent you there in Vienna

CELINE
You know why

JESSE -
I know I mean I wish you would
have been Things might have been
so different in our lives

CELINE
Do you think so

JESSE
Yes I actually do

CELINE
Maybe not maybe we would have hated
each other eventually

JESSE
Come on like we are hating each
other right now

CELINE
Maybe we are only good at brief
encounters walking around in European
cities in a warm climate

JESSE
Ahhh why didnt we exchange numbers
and stuff

CELINE

We were young and stupid

JESSE
Are we still

CELINE
I guess when you are young you
believe that you will meet many people

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 44

Celine is

CELINE (CONTD)
with whom youll connect with but
later in life you realize it only
happens a few times

JESSE
And you can screw it up and miss-
connect

a bit tense

CELINE
Well the past is the past it was
meant to be that way no

JESSE
Do you really believe that That
everything is fated in some way

CELINE
I think the world might be less free
than we think That when given these
exact circumstances this is what
will happen every time Two parts
hydrogen and one part oxygen youll
get water every time

JESSE
No - what if your grandmother had
lived another week or died a week
earlier maybe days things might
have been very different I believe
that

CELINE
But you cant think like that

JESSE
I know you shouldnt on most things
but on this one something was off
Forgive me this but in the months
leading up to my wedding I was
thinking of you all the time And
on the way there Im in the car
with a buddy of mine staring out -
the window as he drove downtown It
was raining and I thought I saw
you not far from the church folding
up an umbrella walking into a deli
on the corner of Broadway and about
thirteenth I thought I was
hallucinating and now I know it
probably was you
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 44h

CELINE
I lived on fifteenth and University

JESSE
See Im not crazy
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

CELINE
(pause)
What is it like to be married You
havent talked much about that

JESSE
I havent How weird I met her
our last year of college and we broke
up and got back together for a period
of years Then we were sort-of back
together and then she was pregnant
and ah So yeah marriage

CELINE
Whats she like

JESSE

Shes a great mom- a good teacher
smart interesting pretty I dont
know I remember thinking at the
time that so many of the men Ive
admired most - their lives have been
committed to something larger than
themselves

CELINE
So you got married because men you
admire were married

JESSE
No it was more like I had this idea
of my best self and I wanted to pursue
that even if it might have been
overriding my honest self Its
funny at that moment I thought didnt
matter so much the who” of it that
ultimately nobody is going to be
everything to you and that it was
the simple action of committing
yourself and meeting your
responsibilities that mattered I
mean what is love if not respect
and trust and admiration and I felt
all those things So cut to the
present tense Ive had sex probably
ten times in the last four years

She laughs
JESSE (CONTD)

Youre laughing at me I know it
sounds pathetic but if somebody
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

They

10 EXT

They

JESSE (CONTD)
were to touch me affectionately Id
dissemble into molecules Im sorry
thats probably more than you want
to hear

CELINE
Less then ten times in four years
Do you masturbate a lot

JESSE
Dont ask that question if you dont
want to hear the answer Im like a
teenager I have to admit in my
youthful idea of marriage it didnt
include a lot of beating off

laugh

DOCK -- AFTERNOON

exit the boat and walk toward the street

CELINE
Im sorry you dont seem that happy
with your marriage - This friend of
mine shes a shrink

JESSE
How is she doing

CELINE
Shes a mess anyway she was telling
me that shes been dealing with a
lot of couples that are breaking up
for the same exact reason

JESSE
Hmmm What reasons that

CELINE
All those couples expected after a
few years of living together for the
passion that consuming desire to
be the same as at the beginning
But it is impossible

JESSE
Yeah I know I know

CELINE
I mean thank god otherwise we would
end up with an aneurysm if we were

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE (CONTD)
in that constant state of excitement
Plus we would end up doing nothing
at all with our lives You think
you would have finished your book if
you were fucking someone every 5
minutes

JESSE
I wouldve welcome the challenge

CELINE
Your wife its natural after the
birth of your son she has to give
all her love to the little one
imagine if she was totally obsessed
with sex and forget about the baby
while shes ridding you like a wild
cat I mean that wouldnt make sense

JESSE
I know That all makes perfect sense
but its more than sex

CELINE
I know its obvious but couples are
so confused now Men need to feel
essential and they dont feel that
way anymore because it was imprinted
in their head for so long that they
had to be a provider Ima strong
women in my professional life I
dont need a man to feed me but I
still need a man to love me and that
I could love

They are now near his car and driver

CELINE (CONTD)
Well heres your driver

JESSE
Yeah

CELINE
I guess now its goodbye no

JESSE
Woah Why dont we give you a ride
home or something

CELINE
I can take the metro no problem
qi

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE
Why not keep talking My flights
not till ten - they have me arriving
two hours early Im sure its not
a problem

CELINE
Tm not exactly on the way

JESSE
Itll be fine
to driver)
Is it okay if we drop off my friend
on the way to the airport

CELINE
Crest pas tres loin cest 10 rue
des petites ecuries

The driver smiles

DRIVER
Allons-y

Jesse and Celine pile in
INT CAR -- AFTERNOON
They sit in the back seat

CELINE
For me its better I dont
romanticize things as much anymore
I was suffering so much all the time
I still have lots of dreams but they
are not in regard to my love life
It doesnt make me sad it is the
way it is

JESSE
Is that why you are in a relationship
with a man that is never around

Celine is a bit stung by his observation

CELINE
Yes obviously I cant deal with
the everyday life of a relationship
we have this exciting time together
and then he leaves and I miss him
but at least Im not dying inside

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

She starts

CELINE (CONTD)
When someone is always around me Im
suffocating

JESSE
Wait a second - you just said you
need to love and be loved

CELINE

Yeah but when I do it quickly makes
nauseous Its a disaster I feel
really happy only when I am on my
own Even being alone is better
than sitting next to lover and feeling
lonely

(getting mad)
Its not so easy for me to be all
romantic You start off that way
and after youve been screwed over a
few times you give up on all your
delusional ideas and you just take
whatever comes into your life Thats

not even true - I havent been screwed -

over Ive just had too many blah
relationships They were not mean
they cared for me but there was no
real excitement or connection or at
least not from my side

erying

JESSE
Im sorry Are you really that
unhappy

CELINE
No its not even that I was fine
until I read your fucking book - it
Stirred shit up It reminded me how
genuinely romantic I WAS how I had
so much hope in things and now I
dont believe in anything that relates
to love I dont feel things for
people anymore Its almost like in
a way I put all my romanticism into
that one night and I was never able
to feel all this again Somehow
that night took things away from me
like I expressed them to you and you
took them with you

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803

CELINE (CONTD)
Somehow destiny not allowing me to
see you again made me cold like if
love wasnt for me

JESSE
I cant believe that

CELINE
Reality and love are almost
contradictory for me Its funny
every one of my exs are now married
Men go out with me we break up and
then they get married Later they
call me to thank me for teaching
them what love is that I taught
them to care and respect women

JESSE
Yeah I may be one of those guys

CELINE
I want to kill them Why didnt
they asked me to marry them I would
have said no but I least they could
have asked But its my fault I
never felt it was the right man
never But what does that mean the
right man The love of your life
The concept is absurd The idea
that we can only be complete with
another person is evil

JESSE
Can I talk

CELINE
I guess Ive been heartbroken too
many times and then recovered Now
from the start I make no effort
because I know its not gonna work

anyway

JESSE
You cant do that- spend your life
trying to avoid pain at the expense
of engaging

CELINE
Those are words You know what I
got to get away from you Stop the
car and want to get out

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE
No wait lets keep talking about it

CELINE
No its just being around you

Jesse takes her arm

CELINE (CONTD)
Dont touch me Im taking a cab
(to Driver)
Laissez moi au coin de la rue La
cest parfait

The driver slows down

JESSE
to driver)
No no keep going
(to Celine)
Listen Im just so glad to be with
you and that you didnt forget me

CELINE
No I didnt and it pisses me off
You come here to Paris all romantic
and MARRIED Screw you Please
dont get me wrong - Im not trying
to get you or anything All I need
is a married man Theres been so
much water under the bridge its
not even about you anymore
Its about that time that moment in
time that is forever gone

JESSE
You say all this stuff but you didnt
even remember having sex

CELINE

Of course I remembered
JESSE

You did
CELINE

Girls pretend things like that

What was I suppose to say I remember
the wine in the park looking up at
the stars fading while the sun came
up We had sex twice you idiot

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

JESSE
You know what Im just so happy to
see you even if youve become an
angry manic-depressive activist I
still like you and enjoy being around
you

CELINE
And I feel the same Im sorry I
had to let it all out Im miserable
in my love life in my relationship
I always act like Im detached but
Im dying inside Im dying because
Im so numb I dont feel pain or
excitement Im not bitter Im
just

The car makes its way through the streets of Paris Celine
and Jesse continue talking in the back seat

JESSE
Oh God you think you are the one
dying inside -My life is 247 bad
The ONLY happiness I get is when Im
out with my son Ive been to
couples counseling things Id never
thought Id have to do Bought self
help books lingerie lit candles

CELINE
Did the candles help

JESSE
Hell no I dont love her the way
she needs to be loved I dont even
see a future for us but then I look
across the table at my beautiful boy
and I think I would suffer any torture
to wake up in his house and be with
him for all the minutes of his life -
I dont want to miss out on that
But man there is no joy or laughter
in my home and I dont want him
growing up in that

CELINE
No laughter My parents are still
together for thirty-five years - and
even when they have a fight they end
up laughing

JESSE
I dont want to be one of those people
getting divorced at fifty-two falling
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803

A pause

JESSE (CONTD)
down into tears admitting that they
never loved their spouse and feel
like theyve lost their life into a
vacuum cleaner I want a great LIFE
I want her to have a great life she
deserves that But were living in
the pretense of marriage
responsibility these ideas of how
people are supposed to live I have
these dreams all the time

CELINE
What dreams

JESSE
I wasnt going to say this but I
have these dreams where Im standing
on a platform and you keep going by
on a train again and again and again
and then I wake up with the fuckin
sweats And then theres this other
dream where you are pregnant beside
me in bed naked and I want to touch
you so bad but you tell me not to
and then you look away and I touch
you anyway right on your ankle and
your skin is so soft and I wake up
in sobs and my wife is sitting there
looking at me and I am ten million
miles from her and I know something
is wrong and I cant keep living
like this Theres got to be more
to love than commitment I have to
tell you I put the whole idea of
romantic love to bed when you werent
there that day I swore it off

CELINE
Why are you telling me all this

JESSE
Im sorry - maybe I shouldt have

CELINE
Isnt it weird that people always
think that they are the only one
getting through tough times I
thought from the article you mustve
had the perfect life- wife kid
published author- but it sounds like
your personal life is more of a mess
than mine

She sees a cat lounging on the cobblestones ahead of them
CELINE (CONTD) °

afternoon sky They are on her doorstep Moment of truth

JESSE
You know what I want you to play me

JESSE
Cmon We got a little more time

CELINE
Ok but quick

She gets out her keys and opens the door
INT STAIRWAY -- AFTERNOON 14

In the lobby of the building they are confronted by a big
winding stairway with a little elevator in the middle

JESSE
I love these kind of stairways
What floor are you on

CELINE
Third

They start up the stairs not saying anything but acting

like everything is normal As they continue in silence the
charged undertone seems even more pronounced Eventually

they reach her front door She pulls out her keys and opens

the door

She closes the door

INT CELINES APARTMENT -- LATF AFTERNOON 15
He awkwardly looks around while she heads to the kitchen

CELINE
Would you like some tea
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 58

JESSE
Sure

As she prepares a couple of glasses we see the details of
her apartment through his eyes Some paintings a picture

of her as a child a photo of her with her grandmother A
cat meanders over the window sill He eventually comes across
an article and a picture of himself pinned up on a bulletin
board

He notices her guitar sitting by the sofa She walks out of
the kitchen and gives him a glass

CELINE

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24803 59

JESSE
Ahhh sounds like a trick question
Give me the ex-boyfriend

CELINE
The ex-boyfriend really

She sits on the couch all hippie style and strums a
beautiful funny song

All Jesse can do is sit across from her on the sofa and smile
When Celine eventually finishes he applauds

JESSE
Wheeeew Encore That was awesome
Now the one about me

CELINE
No no no Have your tea and then
you have to get going

She gets up and goes into the kitchen While shes in there
Jesse pokes around through her cds By the time she returns
a Nina Simone song is playing and he is sitting on the couch

JESSE
Is it okay if I put my feet up

CELINE
Sure Did you ever see Nina Simone
in concert

JESSE
No I wish I had I cant believe
shes gone

CELINE
I know its so sad I saw her play
twice She was great This is one

of my favorites of hers
The song begins
Just in time youve found me just in time -

Before you came my time was running low
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21803 60
I was lost the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you hear now I know just where Im going
No more doubt of fear Ive found my way
For love came just in time youve found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day”
CELINE (CONTD)

She used to stop right in the middle

of a song and walk from behind the

piano over to the edge of the stage

Then shed talk to somebody in the

audience

(imitating Nina)

Oh yeah baby Shed walk off a

little then walk really slow back

over to the mike She had a big

ass and this funny little walk
Celine sort of hunches over and sticks out her butt a little
and proceeds to waddle slowly across the room As the song
keeps going and Celine keeps clowning around Jesse just
sits there with the most peaceful happy grin weve ever
seen on him
Just in time
Before you came my time was running low oh baby
I was lost the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all crossed nowhere to go
Now you hear now I know just where Im going
No more doubt of fear Ive found my way
For love came just in time youve found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day”

CELINE (CONTD)

(imitating Nina Simone
Yo baby You gonna miss that plane
