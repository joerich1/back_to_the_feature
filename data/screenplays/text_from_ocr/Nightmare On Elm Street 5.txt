NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST S5-- The Dre iid -- SandS ist draft — 1

OPEN WITH BLACKNESS
SUPER QUOTE in blood-red script

Even a child is known by his doings
--Old Testament Proverbs xx 11

Underneath it comes the sound of syncopated THUNDEROUS BOOMS
echoing and unnerving as a gigantic heartbeat

FADE UP
INT JOHNSON HOUSE -— NIGHT

Dark and still as the thunderous booming continues muted and
distant

INT ALICES BEDROOM -- NIGHT

ALICE is sleeping curled into the bunched pillows and billowing
comforter on her bed The booming sound grows louder

INT ALICES BATHROOM -- NIGHT

The CAMERA MOVES IN to reveal the source of the mysterious sound
the BATHROOM SINK Super close-up of the DROPS OF WATER falling
in slo-mo

Suddenly FREDDYS LEERING FACE rises on the surface of the water
in the moment before the next drops strike

‘ CUT TO
INT THE DREAM POOL -- NIGHT

Alice floats beneath the surface of the dark water a modern Sleeping
Beauty her long red hair and white nightgown billowing her
features at rest DROPS OF WATER slowly strike the surface of the
pool causing ripples and the thundering sounds we hear

Suddenly Alice is PITCHED from the pool by some unseen force
awake and terrified

INT THE ASYLUM -- CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Alice lands painfully on the cold concrete of the corridor floor The
booming surrounds her now along with the sound of lunatic
shouting the corridor is lined with cell doors behind which a
HUNDRED MANIACS howl

At the end of the hall young AMANDA KRUEGER is toting a mop and
bucket She pauses to unlock the exit door then turns

Suddenly a HAND REACHES OUT for her hair missing by an inch As
she staggers back terrified she falls into the grip of ANOTHER
MANIAC reaching between the bars to take her by the throat

She breaks away stumbles and backs even further down the
corridor away from the exit as DOZENS OF CLUTCHING HANDS now
thrust out of door after door stretching out into infinity blocking her
escape She starts to run down the corridor on a collision course
with Alice

Alice still kneeling on the floor throws hers hands up defensively
and Amanda magically RUNS RIGHT THROUGH HER Alice feels the
effect of the SUPERNATURAL CONTACT instantly yet Amanda seems
oblivious she is trapped in this dream doomed to repeat it forever
Alice is only an spectral voyeur

Amanda stops and turns looking back in terror at the corridor
Suddenly a DOZEN INMATES loom behind her

ALICE
(screaming)
Look out

The inmates GRAB Amanda by every limb drag her screaming to the
floor swarming over her tearing her clothes

CUT TO
EXT ELM STREET -- DAY

ROLL CREDITS over super-close ups of charcoal on paper as someone
draws FREDDYS HOUSE against a pumping rock background track
Intercut close-ups of the artist JEN WALDEZ a bright and quirky
hispanic girl and closeups of RUSTY a neighborhood dog who is
busily sniffing along as he makes pitstops at a series of posts along
the sidewalk

Jen is absorbed in her work-in-progress when Rusty comes loping
up nudging her drawing arm vying for attention She pulls off her
Walkman headphones and the theme music dims becoming the
music on her tape She shooes him away

JEN
Buzz off Rusty Im working Do your people know
youre sniffing around here

Rusty lopes off toward the front porch He goes up the steps to the
front door sniffing

Suddenly a DEISEL ROAR superimposes itself and a BULLDOZER
comes RAMMING through the front door Rusty runs off yipping
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to see that Jens easel is set up by a large
ff

Condemned sign Pull back further to see a larger sign looming in the
foreground proclaiming Coming Soon The Elm St Mall

JEN

And that’s what they call progress

Suddenly a brand new 4X4 pulls up behind her Dan is at the wheel
Alice is in the middle and GINGER BECKER rides shotgun Gingers a
bieach-blond punk Norma Jean masking her vulnerability in leather
and black lace Even her voice is purest Marilyn

GINGER
Jen you are so crazy Your mother said we would
find you here

JEN
Ginger Relax okay

GINGER
I guess graduation isnt all that important

JEN
I just wanted to catch it before it all went down

The bulldozer CRUSHES the facade of the house

DAN
Guess you can go now

Jen shrugs and begins to pack her things Dan rolls his eyes and
drums his fingers on the wheel Alice surveys the wreckage
troubled and distant shaking her head

JEN
Its kind of like the end of an era you know

ALICE
Good riddance

DAN
Hey It’s ancient history now Lets go

Rusty jump in the back and the truck takes off As they go Alice
cant help but stare back through the window as Freddys house goes
down once and for all

CUT TO
EXT SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL -- PARKING LOT -- DAY

The lot is awash in caps and gowns and the flurry of pre-graduation
excitement Dan parks the truck and they all pile out Just then
DEAN WOODYARDS battered dirt-bike screeches to a halt beside
them Dean is black and tres cool decked out in acid-washed
shredded jeans beneath his gown He shakes his long braids back
from under his cap and beams

will each meet the challenges of tomorrow with
confidence and maturity

The seated students clutch their diplomas looking alternately bored
and antsy Dean amuses himself by blowing his tassle out of his face

Ginger cant help herself Dan is attentive while Alice seems pensive
preoccupied as the principal concludes

CUT TO
INT JORDAN HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Alice reaches the top of the stairs the sounds of the party faint
behind her and heads down the hall toward the door at the end
Behind it we hear running water and the sudden sound of violent
retching

Suddenly the hallway seems longer the closed door farther away

and when a HUGE FREDDY-SHAPED SHADOW moves across the wall
her fists ball up and her eyes go wide with apprehension She reels
as if trying very hard not to faint

ALICE
(whispering)
Im okay

a spider plant hanging in the open window stirring in the breeze
backlit from the patio floods She reaches the bathroom door turns
the knob with shaky fingers and goes inside

Dean strides up to them swigging beer and grinning at each girl in
a tum Then he focuses on Ginger as a new song begins

DEAN

dance

GINGER
(curtseying)
Enchanted Im sure

Ginger and Dean move to the center of the dancing teens then erupt
in a very hot dance routine Dean is good but Ginger is astounding
Its clear that she’s in her element the others clear a circle around
them then stand and applaud her moves

Dan moves up to drape an arm around Alices shoulder Jen takes a
step away as all three of them watch the dance

DAN

grinder of Life

JEN

day at a time until they wake up twenty years
from now with a house and two cars and three kids
and a boring job and a boring marriage and a big
fat midlife crisis and theyre never even gonna

And that scares me more than just about anything I
know

solemnly swelling with drunken earnest

DEAN
(maudlin)

So promise me something Promise me that youre
gonna beat the odds and hang on to your dreams
Dont let anybody take ‘em away You do that

(beat)
Or so help me Im gonna come’ round and kick your

his back stone cold unconscious

INT ALICES BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Alice and Dan curl up in the bed drifting off to sleep As her
breathing deepens the beat returns a deep double-boom in
counterpoint with a tiny bell-like echo like two hearts beating in a
symphony of sleep ZOOM IN on Alice

CUT TO
INT ALICES BODY -- NIGHTMARE

The heartbeat thunders as we HURTLE through the body the
TRANSLUCENT WALLS of her VEINS pulsing with life We travel
through a seeming infinity of labyrinthine tubing when suddenly the
walls give way as we enter ALICES WOMB an ENORMOUS CHAMBER
in the middle of which floats the EMBRYO

Suddenly the embryo TURNS begins to GROW at an amazing rate
becoming a FETUS Tiny legs sprout the FACE develops recognizably
human features Its BUD-LIKE ARMS develop into hands

And the FINGERS ELONGATE beyond mere human dimensions
becoming SHINY METAL BLADES

The fetus turns toward the camera revealing its FREDDY-LIKE FACE
Its lips curl into a smile and it THRUSTS its blade-hand into the
WALL of the WOMB

CUT TO
INT -- HOSPITAL -- NIGHTMARE

Alice “wakes up clutching her belly in phantom agony Then the
pain vanishes and she finds herself in an old-fashioned hospital bed
in the middle of a long-emptied ward

A womans cries rise nearby Alice sits up The cries become
distinct clearly emanating from the hallway Alice gets up and
moves toward the sound

INT -- THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Alice looks toward the end of the hall and sees a young woman j
standing there completely silent dressed in flowing white robes
The woman STARES at her Suddenly FOUR BLOOD-SPOTS appear on
her tunic begin to GROW AND SPREAD Before Alice can say
anything the woman turns and walks through an open doorway

ALICE
No wait

Alice keeps moving toward the cries until she enters the doorway
INT THE LAB -- NIGHTMARE

All tubes and beakers and musty apparatus surrounded by a vast
dusty library Alice walks in see a row of large specimen jars At
the end of the row is the TOP HALF OF FREDDYS HEAD (remnant from
Freddys destruction in NOES IV) floating in an oily viscous liquid
As Alice examines it more closely the EYES POP OPEN staring at her
She gasps and turns around

INT -- THE MATERNITY WARD -- NIGHTMARE
A nightmarish birth is in progress young Amanda Krueger in the

throes of labor screaming incomprehensibly while stoic midwife-
nuns preside over her agony

IGHTMARE ON ELM ST 5-- ild-- st draft -- 17

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Abomination The child is evil

There is a BLOOD-CURDLING SHRIEK As Alice watches in horror
Amanda gives birth the life draining out of her as she becomes
dessicated corpse-like

The nuns flee in genuflecting terror as her SWOLLEN BELLY
CRACKLES its robes stretching almost to the bursting point before
the four blood-spots reappear this time followed by FREDDYS
BLADES He EMERGES full-blown from the SMOKING CESEREAN of his
dying mothers womb clawing his way through the crusty placenta
He is alas missing the top half of his head

Freddys body walks over to the specimen jar reaches in and
GRASPS the top of his head He put it on turns to Alice and smiles

FREDDY
Its a boy

Alice shrieks and runs through the lab and as she does the beakers
start to FILL UP with BLOODY GOO She hears Freddy laughing and
sees that the goo has turned into SCREAMING BLOODY FETUSES
writhing in their glass prisons

Freddy comes in looks at the screaming fetuses and taps his
forefinger blade against one of the jars

FREDDY
(chuckling)
Coochie-coochie-coo Come to Poppa

ALICE
I beat you you bastard I sent you to hell

Freddy runs his glove across the stacks of books pulling a thick
dusty volume from one of the shelves He flips it open

FREDDY
Hellits a nice place to visit But I wouldnt want
to live there

(beat)
I told you before I am eternal Im a part of you

Freddy chucks the book

FREDDY
(CONT)
You think therefore I am

Alice turns and runs further and further into the stacks until she
runs into a dead end Shes trapped Freddy chuckles behind her
low and menacing She turns and faces him defiantly

ALICE
You just go ahead and kill me Krueger Youre not
getting anyone out of me this time

FREDDY
(chuckles)
Thats what you think Ive got plans for you
(beat)
-and it all starts right here

He reaches out and lightly touches her belly with his forefinger
blade The blade SPARKS and Alice goes rigid as if she just touched
a high-voltage power line He smiles

FREDDY
Ahhbbhthat hits the spot

He withdraws the blade and Alice collapses sickly reeling

ALICE
What did you do to me

FREDDY

road is narrow and badly paved and it twists and turns wildly They
take a last turn and the road straightens out heading toward the

washed out BRIDGE Dan guns his cycle and heads right for the
abyss

DAN
(shouting over the noise)
Where are you going

DEAN
Trust me

At the last possible second Dean turns and cuts down a trail at the lip
of the bridge Dans control isnt quite as precise and he misses the
turn sliding to a stop at the last second A few stones trickle over

Alice turns around and sees Freddy in the mirror She gasps and
drops the picture which goes spinning toward the floor in slo-mo
As it hits the floor iti SHATTERS spreading five cracks that resemble

Suddenly Alices legs are yanked out from under her She lands on
her back on the bed and her skirt starts sliding up her legs as if by
INVISIBLE HANDS She fights to pull it back down as Freddys

squarely in the middle of the intersection is a frilly white BASINET
It stands there perfectly innocent the rising sun golden behind it

Alice comes up to the crib and looks down smiling

Suddenly a FLOATING POV begins tracking down the street slowly at

toward Alice and the basinet

Alices expression changes to one of dawning terror as a BABYS
BLADED HAND thrusts out of the crib Alice screams and as she
turns to flee EVERY SINGLE WINDOW on the street EXPLODES
outward in a sequential shower of glass as the inhabitants of ELM

Bloody body parts rain down on the street like gumbo coating

up an acetate marked Springwood Examiner 1966-68 She starts
to skim fishing for clues with a grim determination

Alice is still at it Dozens of microfiche cards are before her as well
as books on dreams and nightmares psychology etc She scans
another acetate bleary-eyed from too much reading

Stands out an angry runt a pressure-cooker of a child with a jug-

She looks down at the book The title embossed on the cover says
simply The Dream Pool Alice thumbs to a bookmark and starts to
read at first simply to appease him then with growing interest
ALICE
‘legends and myths on the source of dreams
have been with us since the dawn of time
With the advent of modern psychoanalysis
came the concept of the dream pool the place
where all dreams past present and future
mingle as one Just as every river must eventually
empty into the sea each persons dreams ultimately
becomes a part of the dream pool’

She looks up at JJ

ALICE

Why are you showing me this

Because its important In fact its a matter of life

true then our dreams are like doorways to the
subconscious right
NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST 5-- The Dream Child -- SandS Ist draft — 52

ALICE
Yeah
iJ
And Freddy comes through that door right
ALICE

JJ

So what if that door swings both ways I mean
Freddy was alive once right Which means he

must have dreamt and that means his dreams must
still be out there somewhere in the dream pool So
maybe we can turn the tables on this creep

Alice looks at JJ who smiles that mysterious smile Slowly a similar
one spreads across Alices features She shakes her head

ALICE
Youre a very weird guy JJ

without saying a word and disappears around the corner

She rounds the corner and finds herself in THE ORPHANAGE
CORRIDOR It is much like the asylum corridor a dank and

despairing place reeking of loveless charity and institutional squalor
She hears the wailing of an infant coming from around the corner
Alice moves toward it hesitantly

She rounds the corner and finds herself witness to a strange tableau
Amanda Krueger now Sister Mary Helena is handing over her infant
to the orphanage The iron-faced MOTHER SUPERIOR takes the child
in her arms as the sten PAUNCHY ADMINISTRATOR presides

farther away Its her studio with all her stuff but rendered surreal

Suddenly the drawing of Freddys house begins to shimmer with
light and subtle movement Jen watches in awe as an ANIMATED
RUSTY THE DOG moves across the illustrated lawn to Freddys porch

JEN

Rusty

In the picture Rusty turns and comes loping toward her growing
larger as he comes until his animated 3-D SNOOT actually POKES OUT
OF THE DRAWING Then Rusty BARKS and Jen lets out a nervous
laugh of disbelief

Suddenly ANIMATED FREDDY emerges behind Rusty and before Jen
can scream there is the whir and slash of blades and RUSTYS

He advances toward her and his face becomes a SHIFTING MONTAGE

skull splitting apart into a maggoty mass congealing into goats head
insectoid leering demon thing from the pit and then back to Freddy
again all in the space of seconds

Jen retreats against a stack of crates and boxes grapples with the top

STRETCHES across the room grabbing her by the hair dragging her
horribly forward

A foot from his face she fires up the torch Freddy howls as she
MELTS HIS HEAD and the grip on her falls slack

Then the METAL SCULPTURE rears up at last a hideous metal

We can see him weaken as he drains himself into her giving himself
fully to the baby inside

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

NURSE 1 comes in as Alice begins to convulse The monitors are
going collectively berserk every meter practically off the chart The
nurse freaks hollers for help

The NIGHT INTERN comes running in he takes one look at Alice and
cant believe his eyes She looks horribly deathly ill her features
puffy and distorted her skin mottles and sallow He puts a hand on
her swollen womb something hideous moves beneath the surface

INTERN
Jesus God this womans going into labor
(to the nurse)
I want an delivery room prepped now

Nurse 1 crosses herself before rushing out the door The intern
places a hand on Alices forehead as she CONVULSES again

INT BOILER ROOM -- NIGHTMARE

Freddy looks HORRIBLE anemic and pasty white his bones and
ligaments JUTTING now as he drains away inside her Alices
convulsions are getting worse she is clearly dying

Suddenly a WHITE-BLUE LIGHT appears overwhelming the room
filling the air Freddy whips around his arm still moored to Alices
body A HUMAN FIGURE hovers in the air before him

FEMALE VOICE
Freddy No

Freddy gapes as the figure becomes clear It is Sister Mary Helena
radiant in the light her ghastly dead features perversely gloriously
aglow

FREDDY
(shouting)
You What do you want bitch

MARY HELENA
I want my baby back

Alices eyes flicker open She stares incredulous

FREDDY
Its too late You had your chance

MARY HELENA
I couldnt give you the ‘love you needed The
love that could have saved you

Freddy trembles the blue-white light reflecting on his features

MARY HELENA
I wasnt ready

Freddy starts to shrink away terror in his eyes

MARY HELENA
Im ready now

NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST 5-- The Dream Child -- SandS ist draft — 2

She reaches out to him and suddenly a horrible slick UMBILICAL
CORD whips out from the gaping chasm in her belly to connect with
his NAVEL Freddy shrieks as it begins to TUG at him A ghostly
INFANT WAIL fills the air

MARY HELENA
Youre my baby You will always be my baby

FREDDY
NO Let go of me

MARY HELENA
Come to me Freddy
(beat)
Come to momma

The umbilicus begins to DRAG FREDDY FORWARD his only grip is lost
inside Alices belly Alice SHRIEKS as his arm begins to painfully inch
out of her

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Alices gurney races toward the delivery room doors at the far end of
the hall She is moaning and writhing but still unconscious The
intern and young intense DR SCHOW proceed apace staring
disgustedly at Alices chart

DR SCHOW
(incensed)
This chart is worthless I cant believe this shit

INTERN
I have no explanations

DR SCHOW
Where is that prickless moron Pickman Ill feed
him his balls that incompetent hack This woman

INT BOILER ROOM -- NIGHTMARE

Freddy roars and SLASHES at the cord that drags him Three curling
sections of it splat to the floor They open into TINY INFANTILE
CRYING MOUTHS redoubling the cacaphonous wailing

MORE CORDS emit from Mary Helena then affixing at his extremities
yanking him forward like a puppet One last profoundly thick one
whickers back into his belly flinging him forward There is a
terrible TEARING SOUND as Freddys hand wrenches loose from
Alices belly once and for all

The boiler room itself begins to SHAKE APART pipes and valves
blowing open spewing out torrents of water and steam The catwalk
shudders and screeches Chunks of plaster rain down from above

Mary Helena’s BELLY IS OPEN now like a trap door to another
universe The light is strongest from therein Freddy is dragged
navel-first to the lip of the hole His flesh begins to sizzle and steam
in the near-blinding light

Then his SPINE SNAPS as he WEDGES there hands and feet jutting
and dangling behind him still horribly screaming He stares one last
time and upside down at Alice and all that he has lost His face is
tragic full of horror and pain

For a moment Alice and Mary Helena look into each others eyes a
final acknowledgement Mary Helena nods serene Her eyes close

Then Freddy disappears inside her completely and the white-blue
light goes NOVA blinding and searing The boiler room COLLAPSES
once and for all the CATWALK CRASHING DOWN toward Alices head

Schow between her legs The contractions are less than seconds

Doctor Shes awake

DR SCHOW
Good Tell her Im glad she could make it

Alice looks over at the fetal monitor On the screen two sets of
heartbeats blip across the screen Then one of them fades out She
violently wrenches and it FLATLINES COMPLETELY

INTERN
Weve lost the babys heartbeat

ALICE
(moaning)

DR SCHOW
(Canshaken)
Weve got ten centimeters

The doctor stands locks eyes with Alice He is in control of the
Situation and his look of confidence gets through to her

DR SCHOW
Im going to need your help now Can you push for
me

She nods then cries out He nods his eyes smile above the surgical
mask Then he crouches between her legs again vanishing from her
sight

DR SCHOW
Okay lets get these little boogers outta here Push
for me Good Now do it again

Alice pushes the veins standing out on her beet-red face and neck
her eyes bulging She makes inarticulate animal sounds

INTERN

DR SCHOW (OS)
Yeah here comes Number One A little more
A little moreyes Yes yes Look at this pygmy

Alice looks over her substantially-flattened belly sees the little red
baby dangle upside down as Dr Schow snips the umbilical cord The
little arms do a brief tentative flail arid then the first tiny CRIES
emit from his mouth

DR SCHOW
A tenor I should have known

Alice starts to laugh through her hitching breath a nurse wipes her
forehead She cant take her eyes off the glistening infant even as a
nurse takes him off to be cleaned and swaddied

DR SCHOW

(irritated)
Theres not another baby in here Pickman you
hairball Tl have you filling specimen jars you
little puke

The intern laughs still holding her hand Alice looks up at him and
smiles the chaos receding at last She is still too fried to speak but
her relief is overwhelming

NURSE 2
Ive got a little guy here you might like to meet

The intern lets go of her hand and Alice reaches up to take her baby
in her arms His little eyes are open They stare at each other and
then she hugs him tight Her smile is enormous

Dr Schow takes off his mask and smiles

DR SCHOW
God I love this job

resurged anew

ALICE

This time her father agrees handing over the baby Alice hugs the
boy tight rocking back and forth a troubled look in her eyes
