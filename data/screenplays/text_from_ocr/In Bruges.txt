1 EXT BRUGES STREETS - NIGHT

Various shots of the empty cobble-stoned other worldly
streets of Bruges Belgium It’s winter and a freezing fog
covers everything the Gothic churches the narrow canals
their odd little bridges We could be in any period of the
last five hundred years We happen to be in the present day
RAY speaks over all this

RAY (V0)
After I killed them I dropped the
gun in the Thames washed the
residue off my hands in the bathroom
of a Burger king and walked home to
await instructions Shortly
thereafter the instructions came
through - Get the fuck out of
London you dumb fucking cunts Get
to Bruges” I didn’t even know where
Bruges fucking was

FADE TO BLACK

RAY (V0)

Ken come on theyre the English
police When they say they havent

check the papers again and if
there’s still nothing in ‘em we
phone him and say Harry thank you
for the trip to Bruges it’s been
very nice all the old buildings and
that but we’re coming back to
London now and hide out in a proper
country where it isn’t all just

call to see what we do next

safe

RAY

Do you speak English
CHLOE

No
RAY

Ah yes you do Everybody does What
are you filming midgets for

CHLOE smiles - he’s so genuinely excited by it all

CHLOE
It’s a Dutch movie It’s a dream
sequence It’s a pastiche of Nicolas
Roeg’s ‘Don’t Look Now’ Not a
pastiche but a ‘homage’ is too
strong A ‘Nod of the Head’

RAY is bemused but she’s so cute he doesn’t mind

RAY
Wow your English is very good

He’s losing her he knows it From the depths of his brain he
finally dredges something up

RAY
A lot of midgets tend to kill
themselves Yes A disproportionate
amount Of midgets In comparison to
normal people Herve Villechaise
off of Fantasy Island I think
somebody off ‘The Time Bandits’ A
hell of a lot of midgets Kill
themselves I guess they must get
really sad about like being really
little and that People looking at
them and laughing at them Calling
them names ‘Shortarse’ Theres
another famous midget Im missing
but I can’t remember It’s not the
R2D2 man he’s still going No it’s
somebody else

(Pause) ORR)
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 12

RAY (contd)
I hope your midget doesn’t kill
himself Your dream sequence’ll be
fucked

CHLOE
He doesn’t like being called a
midget He prefers ‘dwarf’

RAY
Well this is my exact point People
going round calling you a midget
when you wanna be called a dwarf of
course you’re gonna blow your head
off

She smiles

RAY
My name’s Ray What’s yours

CHLOE
Chloe How did you get past the
security men

RAY
Getting past security men it’s sort
of my job

CHLOE
Youre a shoplifter

RAY
No I’m not a shoplifter Good joke
though No I’11 tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night

She laughs walks away and RAY thinks he’s lost her until
she tosses a small card over her shoulder and behind her
into the mud

RAY picks the card up It reads ‘CHLOE VILLETTE’ and a mobile
number He watches her hoping she’ll look back She doesn’t

RAY
How fucking cool

KEN smiles In through the yellow-lit windows of the
reception MARIE is quietly talking to her unborn baby

17 EXT BRUGES STREETS - NIGHT

RAY wanders drunkenly the misty cobbled streets and bridges
An odd song plays over like a gentle music box on LSD As he
wanders there’‘s a happiness at having met a girl and a
curiosity at finding the night-lit Bruges a lot more
interesting than he’d have thought

A child’s teddy bear has been left on a canal wall As RAY
tries to button up it’s pretty little jacket the bear’s head
falls off and into the canal and RAY is reminded somewhat
of why he’s in Bruges

Harry Waters says ‘Hello’

RAY shoots him point blank MCHENRY bursts out of his little
compartment clutching his stomach RAY shoots him again

MCHENRY wrenches open the door of the confessional trying to
get away and as daylight bursts in from the body of the
church framing him in angelic shafts of light RAY shoots
him in the back four more times stopping him dead in his
tracks

MCHENRY slowly turns around to face RAY still framed in the
doorway blood trickling from his mouth

MCHENRY
The little boy

RAY doesn’t understand what he’s talking about MCHENRY falls
to his knees then collapses backwards dead revealing
behind him still kneeling in the pews the LITTLE BOY whose
head has been blown apart by one of the bullets that passed
through the priest

alone and silent and still

RAY

involve culture

KEN

culture and fun

RAY
Somehow I believe Ken that the
balance shall tip in the favour of
culture Like a big fat fucking
retarded fucking black girl on a see-
saw opposite a dwarf I was down
the park one day when I was little
and this big fat retarded black girl
came up and beat the fucking shit
out of me for absolutely no reason
Completely beat the shit out of me

anything to do with it

his due)

They end up in front of Bosch’s ‘LAST JUDGEMENT’ which we see
various details from - freakish demons torturing various
people in various freakish ways KEN and RAY take it all in
quietly

RAY
I quite like this one All the rest

one’s quite good What’s it all
about then

KEN

committed And that

24 EXT JAN VAN EYCKPLEIN SQUARE - DAY

KEN and RAY on a bench the distinctive Poorterslodge rising
up behind them

KEN
I don’t know Ray I don’t know what
I believe Um Y¥’know I was brought
up believing certain things I was
brought up Catholic which I’ve more
or less rejected most of

RAY
Yeah they’re nuts arent they

KEN
But the things you’re taught as a
child they never really leave you
do they So I believe in trying to
lead a good life like if there’s an
old lady carrying her shopping
home Well I don’t try and help
her carry her shopping I don’t go
that far but I‘ll certainly hold
the door open for her and that and
let her go out before me

RAY
Yeah And anyway if you tried to
help her carry her shopping shed
probably think you were just trying
to nick her shopping

KEN
Exactly

RAY
This is the world we live in today

KEN
And at the same time at the same
time as trying to lead a good life
I have to reconcile that with the
fact that yes I have killed
people Not many people And most of
them were not very nice people
Apart from one person
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 21

RAY
Who was that

KEN
This fella Danny Aliband’s brother
He was just trying to protect his
brother Like you or I would He was
just a lollipop man But he came at
me with a bottle What are you gonna
do I shot him down

RAY
Hmm In my book though someone
comes at you with a bottle I’m
sorry that is a deadly weapon he’s
gotta take the consequences

KEN
I know that in my heart but I also
know he was just trying to protect
his brother you know

RAY
I know but a bottle that can kill
ya That’s a case of It’s you or
him” If he’d come at you with his
bare hands that’d be different
That wouldn’t’ve been fair

KEN
But technically someone’s bare
hands they can kill you too They
can be deadly weapons too What if
he knew Karate say

Yknow I mean here in the world

30 INT BASILICA OF THE HOLY BLOOD - DAY

Small Gothic chapel RAY sitting irritated in a pew watching
as KEN quietly ambles guidebook in hand surveying the
statues and murals the Stations of the Cross all candle-lit
and warm

KEN ushers RAY over RAY sighs refuses - all this holy shit
is getting to him KEN ushers him over again forcefully this
time RAY idles over head bowed trying not to look at
anything with Jesus on it

KEN
Ray did we or did we not agree that
if I let you go on your date
tonight wed do the things I wanted
to do today

RAY
We are doing the things you wanted
to do today

KEN
And that wed do them without you
throwing a fucking moody like some
five year old who’s dropped all his
sweets

RAY
I didn’t agree to that
(pause)
I’1l cheer up I’1ll cheer up

KEN
This here up there on the altar is
a phial brought back by a Flemish
knight from the Crusades in the Holy
Land and that phial you know what
it’s said to contain

RAY
No what is it said to contain

KEN
It’s said to contain some drops of
Jesus Christ’s blood

RAY feigns interest with his eyebrows
KEN
Yeah That’s where this church gets
it’s name the Basilica of the Holy

Blood

RAY
Yeah
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 27

some more of the iconography for a minute then leaves KEN

calm himself down and concentrate on Jesus’ fucking blood

31 INT BASILICA STAIRWELL - DAY

On the way out still pissed off KEN sees through the
basilica’s beautiful second-storey windows RAY sitting on a
bench in the square below eating an ice-cream Sounds of a
children’s choir

32 EXT BASILICA OF THE HOLY BLOOD - DAY

KEN bursts out of the church and approaches RAY who pays him
no attention transfixed as he is on the CHILDREN’S CHOIR a
short distance to the side as they sing the creepy Christmas
carol Gabriels Message” for the passers-by

None of the kids are much older than eight and a few bear a
resemblance to the LITTLE BOY that RAY killed As KEN gets
closer he sees the tears in RAY’s eyes He slows down loses
his anger and sits beside RAY who wipes his eyes
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 28

KEN
Did you get yourself an ice-cream

RAY
Yeah Strawberry
(pause)
How was Jesus’s blood

The Christmas carol finishes the passers-by applaud

RAY

She stares at him blank-faced

RAY

CHLOE
One of the girls they murdered was a
friend of mine

RAY’s face falls

RAY

She stares at him a while

CHLOE
One of the girls they murdered

She smiles slightly He stares at her open-mouthed

CHLOE
Somehow I don’t believe you shoot

RAY
Somehow I don’t believe you sell

SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 33

RAY
If you thought that why would you
still be sitting here

CHLOE blows a cool stream of cigarette smoke out of the side
of her mouth

CHLOE
I’m horny

She winks at him and goes to the bathroom RAY smiles but
the stream of smoke has hit the neighbouring American-
sounding couple who react like it’s Anthrax

GUY
(under breath)
Fucking unbelievable

This is one of those situations where a normal person
wouldnt react even though he knows he ought to

RAY
What’s fucking unbelievable

The GUY ignores him

RAY

Harry but as soon as he got to

couldnt get enough of it the

unopened condom on the bed tuts puts it away

Looks over CHLOE’s stuff on her dresser opens a distinctive
froggy ornament - it’s full of baggies of cocaine pills
acid etc RAY brightens considerably He helps himself to a
pocketful of drugs then he tries another drawer In it are
two boxes of bullets one irritatingly full of blanks the
second happily full of live rounds He brightens again and
puts the live box in his pocket

How did your date go I’m assuming
not fantastically well

RAY
My date involved two instances of
extreme violence one instance of
her hand on my cock and my finger up
her thing which lasted all too
briefly isn’t it always the way
one instance of me blinding a poofy
little skinhead and one instance of
me stealing three grams of her very
high quality cocaine of which I
have already partaken of one gram
so all in all my evening pretty
much balanced out fine

KEN
Youve got three grams of coke

RAY
I’ve got two grams on me and one
gram in me which is why my heart is
going like the clappers as if I am
about to have a heart-attack so if I
collapse any minute now please
remember to tell the doctors that it
might have something to do with the
coke

KEN

Well to be honest it sounds like
that was all your fault

Hah

HARRY
I mean basically if youre robbing
aman and youre only carrying
blanks and you allow your gun to be
taken off you and you allow
yourself to be shot in the eye with
a blank which I assume the person
has to get quite close to you then
yeah really it’s all your fault for
being such a poof So why don’t you
stop whinging and cheer the fuck up

deadpan even as RAY and CHLOE burst out laughing END POV
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 79

RAY
Jimmy I’ve been wanting to say I’m

They try to stop but again can’t til JIMMY eventually can
only see the funny side too He smiles and joins them at
their table

towards them he doesn’t see them at all and passes on

something and pissed off turns around and heads back the
way he came
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 83

We follow him all the way until he gets to the bar RAY and
CHLOE are at and JIMMY is walking away from Suddenly seeing
them EIRIK stops dead in his tracks CHLOE ushers him over

EIRIK edges away then sprints for the bell-tower RAY and
CHLOE watch him go bemused

79 INT BELL TOWER - NIGHT

HARRY helping KEN down the winding wooden stairs with great
difficulty they suddenly hear someone running up towards
them from far off They sit on the steps and await the
strangers approach The distant footsteps get closer and
closer until they hear still from far below

EIRIK
Mister Waters Mister Waters
HARRY
Who’s that
EIRIK
Its Eirik
HARRY

The blind boy

EIRIK
Ye Er Yes

HARRY
What do you fucking want

EIRIK
The guy youre looking for the guy
Ray He‘’s downstairs

HARRY and KEN freeze

HARRY
Hes where

EIRIK
He’s downstairs at a bar

In a flash HARRY and KEN still sitting side by side pull
their guns and try to point them at each other at the same
time as their free hands grab each others gun hands

It’s like some slow deathly arm-wrestling match but HARRY
is the stronger man and though KEN keeps struggling he
knows there is nothing he can do as HARRY slowly slowly
slowly brings his gun all the way up to KEN’s neck

They look at each other in the eye KEN crying a tear HARRY
almost HARRY blows a massive hole in KEN’s neck KEN
collapses dropping his gun HARRY gets up
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 84

HARRY
Im sorry Ken You can’t kill a kid
and expect to get away with it You
just can’t

KEN nods HARRY starts racing downstairs KEN leans back on
the bloody wooden staircase dying Sounds of HARRY’s
footsteps echo up gradually getting more distant

Suddenly KEN gets an idea He picks up his gun and slowly
starts pulling himself up the stairs towards the look-out
room

STAIRWELL HARRY continues his spiral descent

80 EXT MARKET SQUARE - SOUTH SIDE - NIGHT

Still bemused by EIRIK’s behaviour but not actually worried
RAY orders from the WAITER

RAY

What’s a gay beer

(bemused)

A beer that gay people drink
81 INT BELL TOWER - NIGHT

massive final effort to pull himself onto a side wall He
pulls out his gun and looks down at the Market Square below

KEN’S POV - The freezing fog has descended so heavily that
nothing whatsoever can be seen down there

KEN loses hope leaning in the window
81A EXT MARKET SQUARE - SOUTH SIDE - NIGHT

break the bell-tower entrance framed directly behind her

HARRY continues on

LOOK-OUT ROOM The forlorn KEN suddenly gets an idea He puts
his gun inside his jacket buttons it up tightly then takes
out a handful of coins and lets a few drop out through the
open window down into the fog

82 EXT MARKET SQUARE - NIGHT

Almost in SLOWMO the coins fall out of the fog landing in
the square frightening the PASSERS-BY who move away from
it looking up

83 INT BELL TOWER - NIGHT

LOOK-OUT ROOM KEN drops out all the rest of his coins

84 EXT MARKET SQUARE - NIGHT

The coins hit the ground heavily warning the PASSERS-BY to
give the tower an even wider berth Even RAY has noticed
something’s wrong He looks over and up

8S INT BELL TOWER - NIGHT

STAIRWELL HARRY getting down lower and lower

LOOK-QUT ROOM Scared KEN breathes deeply then lets himself
fall through the window out into the fog

86 EXT MARKET SQUARE - NIGHT

As the PASSERS-BY and RAY are still looking up a figure
plummets out of the fog and crashes to the ground in a
hideous broken heap The PASSERS-BY move away in screaming
horror

RAY flinches in disgust turning CHLOE’s face away then as
he brings himself to look again slowly realises who it is
He sprints over and collapses to his knees beside him

KEN’s head chest and shoulders have just about survived the
impact everything else is pulp

RAY
Ken Ken

KEN
Harrys here

RAY
What

KEN

Take my gun
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES -— 29122006 86

RAY reaches inside KEN’s bloodied coat and comes out with
the broken useless gun Bits of KEN’s heart drip off it

RAY
Ken Where’s my gun Where’s my
gun
KEN
(slowly trying to think)
Hotel
RAY

Oh Ken Jesus

KEN
I’m gonna die now I think

KEN nods then dies RAY is shaking in horror and sadness
HARRY bursts out of the tower sees CHLOE and everyone else
staring at the bloody scene He follows her gaze and sees
RAY

RAY sees him but cannot move

HARRY sees KEN’S pulped corpse the broken gun in RAY’s hand
realises what’s gone down He acknowledges somehow KEN’s
sense of honour courage what have you

RAY starts backing away

Which snaps HARRY out of it He raises his gun

CHLOE screams

Harry fires at RAY but misses

And RAY sprints rapidly away PASSERS-BY and CHLOE
scattering

HARRY gives chase firing whenever he has a clear shot
RAY cuts down an alley and HARRY follows
87 EXT BRUGES STREETS - NIGHT

LONG CHASE SEQUENCE Down the same cobbled streets dark
canal-sides and bridges that weve seen earlier now all mist-
strewn and doubly eerie RAY is chased and shot at by HARRY
However because RAY already knows these streets so well a
large gap starts opening up between them

We CRANE UP as RAY takes another couple of fast corners
taking his jacket off doubling back on himself and finally
comes out on his hotel checks that he’s lost HARRY and
breathless enters

stuff RAY heads upstairs

MARIE

RAY winces keeps moving
89 EXT BRUGES STREETS - NIGHT

HARRY breathing hard opens his pop-up map of Bruges with
‘KEN’S HOTEL’ circled and looks up at a street sign

90 INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

RAY quickly tears the room asunder and finds the hidden gun
checks its loaded He sees the ‘Last Will’ envelope and
almost cries but stops as he suddenly hears downstairs

MARIE (05S)
No I wont let you up there Put
that gun away right now

HARRY (0S)
Lady get out of my way please

MARIE (0S)
No I won’t I wont get out of your

RAY goes to the top of the stairs peeks round the corner and
down at MARIE on the second step of the stairs blocking the
way of HARRY below her RAY crouches down and takes aim as
they argue
SHOOTING SCRIPT — IN BRUGES — 29122006 88

of HARRY but it’s just above MARIE’s pregnant tummy END

HARRY
Well obviously Im not gonna go
through you am I with your baby
and that I’m a nice person But

RAY chooses not to take the shot and lowers the gun As RAY
speaks HARRY ducks out of sight

RAY

shooting until she’s left the hotel

HARRY
I swear not to start shooting til

astonished RAY peeks out and looks down at him They
exchange a look of ‘What the hell is wrong with this woman’

HARRY

I suppose youve got a gun up there
RAY

Yeah
HARRY

Well what are we gonna do We can’t
stand here all night

MARIE
Why don’t you both put your guns

If you run outside and round the

out of the whole entire thing

HARRY
Do you completely promise to jump
into the canal I don’t wanna run
out there and come back in ten
minutes and find you fucking hiding

MARIE is left sitting there stunned

91 INTEXT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

RAY pulls open the lattice-window looks down into the waters
below prepares himself

ethen sees a canal-boat approaching quickly out of the
freezing fog empty save for the DRIVER RAY times it so it’s
just under his window as he leaps

92 EXT CANAL BOAT -NIGHT

-And lands in the boat with a thud His gun however
topples out of his hands and is lost in the murk of the
canal

RAY

Keep driving

RAY suddenly sees HARRY appear at the distant canalside look
around at the water a few seconds then spot RAY in the boat
getting further and further away into the mist HARRY takes

aim as the DRIVER speeds up

RAY
(quietly)
No way You’re way too far away

HARRY steadies his gun hand takes aim at RAY steadily
receding into the fog

HARRY
No way I’m way too far away

RAY is hit fully in the stomach busting a bloody hole there
He falls back in the boat The DRIVER speeds towards the
nearest landing dock

HARRY seeing the boat aiming for the distant dock sprints

away to cut them off MARIE watching him go from the doorway
Its beginning to snow

96 EXT DOCK - NIGHT

Bleeding profusely and terribly faint RAY walks up the steps
of the dock The DRIVER tries to help him but he says he’s
okay and gives him the last of his money

In the background HARRY can be seen running along the other
side of the canal towards the nearest bridge

At the top of the steps RAY sees distantly through the fog
and the snow the arc-lights the costumes the cameras and
the people of JIMMY’s film set He staggers towards them

97 EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

HARRY puts his gun away so he doesn’t look so suspicious to
the PASSERS-BY but keeps on after RAY

98 EXT CANALSIDE FILM SET - NIGHT

RAY slowly staggers into the middle of the misty set which
seems to be waiting for the freezing fog to clear All the
EXTRAS are dressed in strange nightmarish masked costumes
many frighteningly similar to the demons and those
terrorised by them in Bosch’s ‘LAST JUDGEMENT’ Some have an
identical bullet wound to RAY’s who staggers through all
these dizzily horrified

He tries to warn them of the danger from HARRY but they
don’t seem to understand A little way off JIMMY THE DWARF
gets up to see what all the fuss is about but can’t quite
see through the throng of people so tries to push his way
through them

RAY falls to his knees at one point but gets up and staggers
on HARRY finally arrives a few feet behind him and takes
his gun back out The EXTRAS don’t seem to be sure if this
isn’t all part of their film somehow

RAY suddenly stops dead in his tracks staring at something
in front of him horrified

RAY
The little boy

HARRY
That’s right Ray The little boy

HARRY fires twice through RAY’s back RAY falls to his
knees

RAY
Oh Jesus no

--then slumps to the ground revealing to us and to HARRY
the body of JIMMY THE DWARF one of the bullets having passed
through RAY and blown JIMMY’s head off
SHOOTING SCRIPT - IN BRUGES - 29122006 92

RAY crawls up beside him and touches him gently He’s
obviously dead and with his head half gone and his school-
cap and uniform still intact he looks just like a little
dead boy

He looks that way to HARRY anyway as he stands above the
pair horror-stricken HARRY looks at RAY RAY looks at
HARRY

HARRY
Oh I see

Slowly very slowly HARRY raises his gun and places it in
his own mouth

RAY
No Harry no

HARRY takes the gun out again taps it against his teeth a
moment thinking then nods

HARRY
Youve got to stick to your
principles
HARRY puts the gun back into his own mouth

RAY
Harry No He’s not

«--and blows his head completely off

RAY slumps back down The gunshot rings in his ears and all
other sound is gone

RAYS POV - looking up at the misty night sky and the roofs
of the old buildings around as the snow falls heavy then in
turn

At the horrifying Bosch figures looking down at him

At one-eyed EIRIK somehow amongst them looking as guilty as
Judas

At the dismayed tear-stricken face of CHLOE being dragged
away from him screaming (silently)

At the AMBULANCEMEN and DOCTORS whose grim countenances
dont seem to hold out too much hope

At from somewhere almost heavenly MARIE whose gentle
angelic smiling face makes him think it all might work out
alright in the end

LONG PAUSE
99 INT ROOM - DAY

CLOSE SHOT of a NEWSPAPER HEADLINE seemingly reading ‘IN
BRUGES’ We pull back to reveal the headline actually reads
‘THREE DIE IN BRUGES BLOODBATH’ We pull back further to
reveal beneath the headline the photo’s of HARRY JIMMY and
KEN This whole piece of paper has been pinned to a wall

A telephone starts ringing

Sitting on his bed his chest and stomach wrapped in
bandages is RAY the newspaper article pinned to the wall to
the side of him It’s three months since the shooting he’s
unshaven and sickly-looking The phone is still ringing

He puts a couple of ice-cubes from the tray beside his bed
into his glass pours some whisky in and drinks The phone
finally stops ringing

RAY gets up still in pain and moves across the room
passing another newspaper headline on the wall reading ‘STILL
NO CLUES IN MURDER OF LITTLE TOBIAS’ along with a large happy
picture of the little boy from the church Also pinned to the
wall is the LITTLE BOYs confession note

As we see these we hear RAY open a cupboard and take
something metallic out

Phone starts ringing again RAY sits back on the bed in the
same position as before takes another sip of whisky and
picks up the phone He doesn’t speak

RAY
(pause)
Because I dont want you to hear the

gunshot

RAY hangs up then takes the receiver off the hook and lays
it down It will quietly drone through the rest of the scene

A tear falls as he takes the gun that was resting in his lap
holds it in the air for a second breathes deeply for a few
moments then places it against his head

He holds it there a long while eyes closed deep breathing
then finally takes it away opens his eyes picks up his
whisky glass sighing and slowly finishes it off Courage
regained he puts the glass back down breathes deeply again
and puts the gun back up to his head

RAY
Come on Ten nine eight seven

He closes his eyes

RAY
Six five four three two one

Teeth gritted eyes clamped tight ten more seconds pass til
he finally sighs loudly takes the gun away again and leans
his head back against the wall

He looks at the photos on the wall from the newspaper story
of JIMMY of HARRY and lingeringly of KEN None of them
want him to go through with it

Then finally he looks at the photo of little TOBIAS and the
blood-stained confession note beside it He moves across the
bed and takes the confession note from the wall knocking
into the telephone slightly as he does so

He looks at the phone a while as it irritatingly drones on

He puts the phone back on the hook and looks at it a very
long while to see if it’ll ring It doesn’t ring

He sits on the edge of his bed shitty London framed out the
window behind him

He looks at the confession note again as do we

RAY’S POV 1 Being sad 2 Being bad at maths 3 Being
moody” and the months-old blood still caked in the corner

He folds the note into his left breast pocket beside his
heart He nods

RAY
Youve got to stick to your
principles
He cocks the gun
He slowly puts it to his head

Tears fill his eyes and he closes them as the tears fall

He sighs calmly knowing perhaps for the first time that
this time hell go through with it

The telephone starts ringing
He opens his eyes

CUT TO BLACK
