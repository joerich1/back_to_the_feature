THE THREE MUSKETEERS

OPEN ON
1 EXT GASCONY - DAWN

Dawn A verdant field in Gascony BIRDS CALL from tree-
tops The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves A fox
darts into a thick hedge And last anti-pastoral out
of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL

SUPERIMPOSE France 1625

Suddenly two young men burst INTO VIEW sword points
cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air The
first is GIRARD bearded nearly thirty a man in every
facet The second DARTAGNAN Younger in appearance
and attitude Exuberant handsome And at just this
moment bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous
cry

They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew
Girard is the more polished combatant But dArtagnan is
nearly a force of nature He whips his sword through the
air with wild-hearted abandon He tumbles and somer-
saults This is fun

Girard and dArtagnan cross the field pass over a wooden
fence struggle toward a stable and hayloft As they
fight both men utilize a variety of props Handfuls of
hay a wooden spar quick kicks from heavy boots
Anything goes as the swords cut through the air
DArtagnan gaining increasing advantage forces Girard
up against a peaceful country manor Girard seemingly
cornered executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof
fights from this high angle DArtagnan merely smiles
and follows
ANGLE ON ROOFTOP

Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun Girard
and dArtagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop pause

to exchange swipes at the peak then slide down the other
side attacking defending as they go

INCLUDE INTERIOR

Inside the manor house a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances
up from her writing table hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof

She reacts -- curious not afraid -- and steps to an open
window As if to follow the footsteps to the other side

BACK TO SCENE
Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-
closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE DArtagnan flies
after The geese scatter dArtagnan -- whose wild

progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --
stumbles briefly Girard seeks advantage thrusts his
sword toward the young mans heart But dArtagnan
parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand rolls over
the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and
rises to fight again

The epic battle continues Girards modest success de-
volves into desperate flight DArtagnans seemingly
endless reserves are wearing him down Then at the
last possible moment Girard spies escape a slow-
moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road He runs
toward the cart leaps upon it turns back to dArtagnan
with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes
when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap
to join him

And still they battle the clash of swords a kind of
music by now the men their exuberance the bright morn-
ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display Just
then The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge Girard
backs from dArtagnans sword weak from exhaustion he
stumbles DArtagnan has his man and he knows it He
prepares one last blow --

-- And the haycart shifts deposits both men over the
side and down to the small muddy creek below A comical
antidote to all this glorious swordplay

INCLUDE CREEK

Girard lands flat on his back stunned his sword out of
reach DArtagnan lands similarly but recovers with
grace or rather as much grace as the muddy situation
will allow He rolls toward Girard sword in hand and
lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adams
apple

A long beat Then a surprise Girard begins to laugh
long and loud DArtagnan responds with a charmed smile

DARTAGNAN
Had enough
GIRARD
(breathless
deadpan)
I believe now would be a good
time to end your uhm formal
training Well done

DARTAGNAN
Thank you sir
DArtagnan leaps to his feet races off without another
word Girard struggles upward peers at the shape of his
clothing -- cut to ribbons muddy and soaked

GIRARD
And god have mercy on whomever
you meet next

INT DARTAGNANS HOME - DAY 8

DArtagnan steps through the country manor calls out

DARTAGNAN
Mother
But he does not see her DArtagnan continues chatter-
ing proudly as he goes
DARTAGNAN

Did you see us You heard us

Ill bet Girard finally

surrendered a compliment

though I almost had to kill him

to get it Mother
DArtagnan comes upon an open door a small room beyond
He pauses then steps inside
INCLUDE FATHERS STUDY

A Spartan interior Heraldic emblems upon the wall sou-
venirs from battles won and lost

A piece of parchment on it the words All For One and
One For All And in a place of honor a worn blue and
gold tunic Below it the Handsome Woman dArtagnans
mother kneels at an open chest She turns back to him
MOTHER (HANDSOME WOMAN)
Sit down

DARTAGNAN
Didnt you hear me Girard --

MOTHER
Sit
DArtagnan sighs sits in a large wooden chair A beat
His mother speaks quietly eyes turned back to the open
chest
MOTHER
Your father was a proud man And
he had a right to be I never
knew one as brave or as kind He
knew that his strength was a gift
to be given in the service of
honor That is why he dedicated
his life to his country and his
King That is why he gave his
life for both

She reaches into the chest carefully extracts a
beautiful saber
MOTHER

I watched you this morning and

saw someone I knew You have

your fathers heart his will to

fight his courage But these

gifts have no value unless they

are given
She rises holds the sword out to him

MOTHER
Its time for you find your
fortune with men as brave and
as bold as you are In Paris
With the Kings Musketeers
(re sword)
Youll need this

DARTAGNAN
(quiet moved)

Fathers sword 9
MOTHER
Forged in the Crusades handed
from generation to generation
DARTAGNAN
And now to me
DArtagnan cant help it his eager reply leavens the
nobility of the moment with warm humor youthful inno-
cence His mother smiles as she repeats
MOTHER
Yes son And now to you
With that she holds out the beautiful saber DArtagnan
takes it firmly into his hands
CUT TO
EXT GASCONY - DAY 10
A huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment
Mother and son stand in the vast expanse DArtagnan
holds a restless horse by the reins his traveling satch-
el attached to the saddle
MOTHER
Im not your mother now Im
speaking for your father And
this is what he would have told
you Never forget the code of
the dArtagnans It is your
special heritage
(beat)
Always seek out adventure
DARTAGNAN
I will
MOTHER
Never run from a fight
DARTAGNAN
I wont
MOTHER
Never submit to insults Except
from the King
DARTAGNAN
Never

MOTHER

And be wary of Cardinal Richelieu

for he rules France through the

King
A bittersweet moment DArtagnan posed before his first
great adventure But not completely certain that he
wishes to leave home

DARTAGNAN

Mother Maybe I should wait

Until after harvest
DArtganans mother smiles understands And speaks
gently to urge him forward

MOTHER
Youve heard that every man in
the Musketeers is on the run from
someone or something
DARTAGNAN
Yes But what am I running from

MOGHER
(gentle humor)
A shrew of a mother and a drafty
old house Now go

And in this fashion she releases him DArtagnan sweeps
his Mother into an embrace now turns heroic and leaps
into the saddle The horse reacts with a start skitters
in a half-cicle DArtagnan struggles to gain control
finally brings the horse to rein He manages a charmed
grin His mother smiles scolds
MOTHER
And for heavens sake practice
your horsemanship
DARTAGNAN

Horsemanship Got it
DArtagnan digs his heels into the horses flanks shoots
off across bright green fields His Mother shields her
eyes from the sun feels a gathering of tears and
watches him ride into the distance

EMBLEM OF KINGS MUSKETEERS 12
It FILLS the SCREEN serves as background for the MAIN

TITLES As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS and the MUSIC ENDS

the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME It slides beneath the
emblem pries it off the wall The emblem falls to the

floor with an undignified thud A fire blazes in a huge

hearth behind it

INCLUDE MUSKETEERS HEADQUARTERS 13

A room in the Musketeers Headquarters The fallen emblem
is retrieved by JUSSAC an officer who wears the bright
red tunic of the Cardinals Guards
JUSSAC
What should I do with this

Jussac offers the emblem to a tall elegant wraith in
black finery a patch covers one eye This is the COUNT
DE ROCHEFORT Richelieus right hand one of the deadli-
est swordsmen in all of France
ROCHEFORT
Throw it on the fire with
everything else

JUSSAC
But this is the emblem of the
Musketeers

ROCHEFORT

The Musketeers no longer exist
Or havent you heard
(cold command)
Throw it on the fire
Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze it is
instantly consumed Rochefort watches it burn then
walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard

INCLUDE COURTYARD 14
Grim funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove

their blue and gold tunics drop them into a pile that

already contains their swords and muskets The

Musketeers remain stoic throughout unwilling to reveal

the depth of their despair The latter is supervised by

the Cardinals Guards who view their hated enemies

plight with satisfaction This is a sad day for the

Musketeers the end of an era

MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain
of the Cardinals Guards hands over his own musket

14
Treville is the respected leader of the Musketeers This
is the saddest moment of all
Rochefort watches from above a cruel smile twists his
lips He steps to the railing addresses the men below
ROCHEFORT
Musketeers
A hundred faces turn upward to regard him And on each
the same expression -- absolute loathing for the man in
black Rochefort is not intimidated by this sea of con-
tempt He revels in it
ROCHEFORT

By joint edict of His Majesty

King Louis XIII and His Eminence
Cardinal Richelieu the
Musketeers are officially
disbanded In preparation for

the coming war with England your
ranks and commissions are hereby
transferred to the Infantry You
will be contacted and told where
to report Until that time you
are instructed to return to your

homes
DE TREVILLE
(shouting to
Rochefort)
And who will protect the King
ROCHEFORT

The Cardinals Guards are more
than capable of assuming that
responsibility

Muttered curses and dissent throughout Rochefort raises
his voice to be heard

ROCHEFORT

You are hereby ordered to
disperse Should even one of you
resist the entire corps will
be arrested and imprisoned

(with pleasure

and disdain)
All for one and one for all

As Rochefort intended the Musketeers explode But
before they can attack the Guards de Trevilles com-
manding voice calls out above the clamor 14
DE TREVILLE
Musketeers

And with that the Musketeers freeze Their eyes go to
de Treville There is a moment of silence as de Treville
chooses his words carefully Even in defeat de Treville
is stoic

DE TREVILLE
Go to your homes Wait Our
day will come again

De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles
in a patronizing manner Then de Treville leads his
Musketeers out of the courtyard

ROCHEFORT 15
He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by
Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely He goes to a
mirror and preens adjusting his eye patch to a more rak-
ish angle Thats when he catches a glimpse of something
behind him Something red Rochefort turns
a tall powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the
room a spectre in red
ROCHEFORT

Your Eminence
Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees
ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the
darkness and into the light his long crimson robes
swirling about him like clouds of blood His face is
long shrewd and intelligent His eyes are penetrat-
ing He smiles his crocodile smile
Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls
It contains the names of all the Musketeers past and
present

RICHELIEU
Have they all been accounted for

ROCHEFORT
(hedging)
All but three

On Richelieus face a flicker of irritation

RICHELIEU
Three

15
JUSSAC
(speaking up)
I sent a patrol to find them but
it hasnt returned yet
RICHELIEU
I want those Musketeers not
excuses Bring them in at once
CUT TO
EXT BOULEVARD OF CRIME - DAY 16

Jussac leads a regiment of the Cardinals Gruards down
Paris most colorful and notorious street They react
to SHOUTING and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern
ahead The one called The Dead Rat

The tavern door flies open and two of the Cardinals
Guards are flung into the street bruised and bloody
Just then A window on the second floor bursts open

and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his
feet threatening to drop him into the street The
Musketeer a man of enormous appetites -- wine women

song -- is called PORTHOS Jussac shouts
JUSSAC
Release that man
Happy to comply Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges
to the street with a dull thud Then with a wink anda
piratical grin Porthos ducks inside Jussac darkens
signals his men and they rush toward the tavern

INT TAVERN

Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in
a shambles the aftermath of a violent fight But for
now all is calm

A group of the Cardinals Guards is seated around a big
table littered with flagons and bottles On the floor
around them are their swords and rifles It appears the
Gruards are celebrating a victory But wait Theres
something wrong with this picture On closer inspection
we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-
clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes They are

all bruised and bloody Some are unconscious

Presiding over the celebration are two Musketeers
They sit at the head of the table relaxing with their
boots up

17
One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand-
kerchief He is ARAMIS the most handsome and dashing of

the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of

great personal charm and style

His companion is ATHOS the Musketeers deadliest and

most charismatic member -- also its most mysterious and
tortured Athos is the unofficial leader of the Three
Musketeers their planner and strategist At the moment

hes sewing up a nasty gash on his right arm

JUSSAC
(approaching)
What is this

Athos greets him with a dark smile

ATHOS
A private party Go away

ARAMIS
Athos -- is that any way to greet
our guests

Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously He is the
epitome of politeness

ARAMIS
Dont be shy gentlemen Come
in Your friends have been
expecting you
Jussac is not amused

JUSSAC
Your presence is requested at
Musketeer Headquarters by Captain
Rochefort
Athos and Aramis exchange looks

ATHOS
The Cyclops is a Captain He
mustve made a pact with the

Devil
ARAMIS
Or the Cardinal
ATHOS

Whats the difference 17
ARAMIS
(with an edge
of contempt)
The Devil is more ethical than
the Cardinal

Jussac takes a step forward fingering his saber

JUSSAC
Youre instructed to come with
me and surrender your tunics

With a sweeping gesture Athos indicates the bloody
Guards around him

ATHOS
These gentlemen made a similar
request
JUSSAC
Are you refusing to come
peaceably
ATHOS
Probably But Ill leave it up
to my companions Aramis
ARAMIS
We cant refuse Rocheforts
invitation It would be
impolite
Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward

ATHOS
And what do you say Porthos

To the Guards surprise Porthos is balancing on the
balcony rail above just about even with a large wagon
wheel chandelier

PORTHOS
Ill be right down
With the grace of an aerialist Porthos jumps from the
balcony and lands atop the chandelier His weight causes
the chains suspending it to break With a whoop of
pleasure Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands
squarely atop Jussacs Guards squashing them

When the dust clears only Jussac has been spared He

looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from

the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off 17
PORTHOS
(to Athos and
Aramis cheerful)
Ready when you are
Athos and Aramis sheathe their swords put on their hats
wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join
Porthos
ARAMIS
Congratulations Porthos You
brought down the house
PORTHOS
My aim was off I was trying to
hit Jussac

Athos fixes Jussac with a dark threatening look
ATHOS
Now About those tunics
Jussac turns to watch Athos Porthos and Aramis step to
the street He mutters as if to curse
JUSSAC
Musketeers

EXT HIGH ROAD TO PARIS - DAY 18
DArtagnan on horseback pauses on a bluff overlook-

ing the magnificent city on the Seine What he beholds

is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-

teenth Century its steeples and towers rising to meet the

sky For a country boy like dArtagnan Paris is a

magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true
DArtagnans reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING
HOOFBEATS coming from behind He turns in response and

what he sees is this

Two women on horseback are riding for all theyre worth
pursued by two men on horseback

DARTAGNAN

His heroic blood stirs Women in danger As the women
GALLOP past dArtagnan leaps from his horse Quickly
formulating a plan he clambers up the trunk of a nearby
tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road

ANGLE

As the two riders pass underneath dArtagnan leaps into
space and tackles one of them knocking him out of the
saddle The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-
less One down

DArtagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-
verses direction and GALLOPS back charging dArtagnan
The rider draws his saber

DArtagnan dodges the horse and the sword He catches
the second riders arm and yanks him right out of the
saddle The man lands with a painful thud at
dArtagnans feet Before he can recover dArtagnan is
upon him with flying fists One swift punch -- and the
second rider is senseless Two down

DArtagnan stands over his two victims out of breath
but greatly pleased with his performance He looks up as
the two women ride back to see whats happened
The first woman is of noble breeding a beautiful dark-
haired girl in her late teens Her name is ANNE Her
companion is roughly the same age titan-haired and
equally beautiful Her name is CONSTANCE
Anne regards the two men on the ground then dArtagnan
She shakes her head laughs with delight and rides off
Constance remains She smiles down at dArtagnan from
atop her horse
CONSTANCE
Do you have any idea what youve
done

DARTAGNAN
Ive saved you and your friend
from these bandits

CONSTANCE
These bandits are the Queens
own bodyguards

DArtagnan is stunned
DARTAGNAN
The Queen

Constance points a finger in Annes direction
CONSTANCE
If I were you Id make myself

scarce These men are going to be
very angry when they wake up

20
DArtagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning
to recover Then he looks up at Constance feeling like
a prize idiot
DARTAGNAN
I didnt know I thought

Constance smiles at him her eyes twinkling
CONSTANCE
Do you have a name

DARTAGNAN
DArtagnan

CONSTANCE
Youre a very foolish boy
dArtagnan but a very handsome
one Good-bye
Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with
Anne
DARTAGNAN
(calling after her)
Wait You didnt tell me your
name
But Constance is gone
DArtagnan stands in the middle of the road feeling
foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time The two
bodyguards groan and grumble

A bright reflection catches dArtagnans eye He looks
down and sees a gleaming bracelet He picks it up and

DARTAGNAN
The man who attacked you
(pointing in the
opposite direction)
- went that way
With a guilty smile dArtagnan spurs his horse and rides
like Hell

EXT COUNTRY ROAD 21

DArtagnan rides to the top of the ridge stops suddenly
sees something that takes his breath away

DARTAGNANS POV 22
Paris laid out for him like a jewel cloaked in mystery

promising adventure and romance DArtagnan watches the
women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance
He follows

INT MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY 23
Athos Aramis and Porthos sweep into the now deserted
courtyard Silence -- the last thing they expected --

stops them in their tracks The place is a cemetery
haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers
Porthos is visibly distraught Rochefort enters from
behind an archway

ROCHEFORT
Ill take those tunics
Musketeers

PORTHOS

(to Aramis)
What did he say
ARAMIS
He said hell take those tunics
PORTHOS

Tunics Coming right up
Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled
red tunic he took from one of the Cardinals guards He
drops it on the ground digs into a pocket and takes out
another He finds another in his boot and another up his
sleeve Theres one in his hat Like a magician he
keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places

Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves
They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile

ATHOS
I was trying to remember the last
time I saw you here I know It
was the day you were kicked out of
the Musketeers

ARAMIS
Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer
Wasnt that the charge

ROCHEFORT
You ought to know Three witnesses
stood against me

23
ATHOS

It was the least we could do

The bitter memory hangs in the air for a moment

ROCHEFORT
You are hereby ordered to
surrender your commissions and
make yourselves available for
reassignment in the Kings Army

ATHOS
And if we refuse

ROCHEFORT
You will become outlaws Hunted
men

PORTHOS

It doesnt matter where I go or

what I do Sooner or later

somebodys calling me outlaw
Athos cuts him off with a look Hes familiar with
Porthos propensity for tall tales But not here not
now Athos turns back to the balcony Rochefort lobs a
taunt

ROCHEFORT
Are you refusing to serve your
King

ARAMIS
We are refusing to serve the
Cardinal

PORTHOS
Same thing these days

ARAMIS

France has one King too many

ROCHEFORT
Ill tell him you said that

Athos who has remained silent speaks with quiet power

ATHOS
Do that Rochefort Tell his
Emminence the Cardinal that we
will continue to perform our sworn
duty to protect the King From
enemies across the sea

(MORE) 23
ATHOS (CONTD)

From traitors who sit at his right

hand And tell him that he can

take away our tunics our muskets

even our swords But he cannot

stop us from being what we are

Musketeers

The gauntlet has been thrown Rochefort picks it up with

glee

ROCHEFORT
Ill make sure His Emminence the
Cardinal gets the message But I
cant promise hell be pleased

Rochefort steps back disappears into the shadows
beat The Musketeers regard each other
PORTHOS
Well if were going to be
outlaws I suppose well have to
get our affairs in order

ARAMIS
Are you going to visit them
alphabetically or in order of

preference
PORTHOS
Alphabetically seems fair
ARAMIS

When it comes to you and women
fairness rarely applies
ATHOS
(interrupts)
Well meet at the Columbier-Rouge
at sundown
(off their looks)
To celebrate And to plan our new
lives
PORTHOS
Outlaws

ARAMIS
Citizens of France

ATHOS
The three Musketeers
And that is all that remains Athos Porthos and Aramis step in different directions

EXT STREETS OF PARIS - DAY

DArtagnan rides through the streets of Paris A country
boy happily stunned by the sights sounds and smells of
the city Merchants gossip and call to each other from
shop doors Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along
the crowded boulevard Acrobats puppeteers and jug-

glers perform on street corners LAUGHTER and MUSIC
drift from taverns and public houses

DArtagnan views it all with great enthusiasm He sees
the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters wow The
future belongs to him

ATHOS 25
He crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door But as
he reaches for the handle the door flies open and smacks
him in his injured arm
DARTAGNAN
(as he enters)
Look out
ATHOS
(wincing in pain)
Aaarrgghh

DARTAGNAN
(in a panic looking
around)
Where are they Where are the
Musketeers Im in the right
place arent I

ATHOS
(through gritted
teeth)
Not as far as Im concerned

Athos is wearing his cape in such a way that it hides
his Musketeer tunic DArtagnan has no idea who hes
dealing with

DARTAGNAN
But this is Musketeer
Headquarters

25
ATHOS
No This was Musketeer
Headquarters
DARTAGNAN
You mean its been moved

ATHOS
I mean the Musketeers have been
disbanded Feel free to poke
around for souvenirs

DARTAGNAN
What do you mean disbanded

ATHOS

Some nonsense about being needed in
the army Now if youll excuse
me
DArtagnan blocks Athos path
DARTAGNAN
But I just got here How can I
become a Musketeer if theyve been
disbanded
ATHOS
Id say youve got a problem
DArtagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm Athos stif-
ling pain fixes dArtagnan with a deadly look
ATHOS
You could use a lesson in manners
DArtagnan touches his sword eyes flashing at the pos-
sibility of a duel

DARTAGNAN
Any time
ATHOS
Im in a hurry now -- but Ill

meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux
monastery at noon

Athos exits
DARTAGNAN
(calling after him)
Ill be there ten minutes early

DARTAGNAN (CONTD)

horseback distinctive cloaks hiding their faces Anne

START CLOSE ON Porthos his rogues grin the twinkle in
his eye
PORTHOS

But Catherine dont you see As

an outlaw Ill be constantly on

the run from the Cardinals guards

a refugee Think of all the places

you can hide me Im thinking of

them now

ANOTHER ANGLE 27

reveals Porthos leaning against an open window speaking
amiably to a pretty woman on the other side She dabs a
tear from her eye manages a nod

ANGLE ON DARTAGNAN 28
Meanwhile dArtagnan races around another corner down a
narrow lane and speeds after the ladies on horseback

He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water
all over Porthos where he stands DArtagnan doesnt
notice a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled
INTO VIEW blocking the lane Fellow travelers shout
complaints the cart driver shakes his head makes an
obscene gesture Its a Seventeenth Century traffic jam

DArtagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis-
tance tie their horses and step into an alley A man
waits in the shadows to escort them DArtagnan leaps
off his horse he means to continue his pursuit on foot
But he takes two quick steps and runs directly into
Porthos outstretched hand

28
DArtagnan looks up -- literally given Porthos impres-
sive stature -- and sees the Musketeers muddied tunic

and worse a unique and expensive sash now thoroughly
soiled

PORTHOS
(not a glimmer of a
grin)
Do you know where this sash comes
from
DARTAGNAN
No
PORTHOS
It is a gift from the Queen of
America

Porthos righteous indignation is more impressive than
his knowledge of current affairs DArtagnan corrects
DARTAGNAN
There is no Queen of America

PORTHOS
(to pretty woman)
Madame Augustine would you excuse
me for a moment Im going to kill
him
(back to dArtagnan
ever the gentleman)
Now where were we
DARTAGNAN

(glancing at the

ladies the alley)
I rode through a puddle muddied
your sash the Queen of America
except there isnt one Im ina
hurry and you were about to
challenge me to a duel

PORTHOS
(amused)
I was

DARTAGNAN
That seems to be the local custom
Porthos lets out a weary sigh He shakes his head 28
PORTHOS
Everywhere I go its always the
same Theres always some kid who
thinks hes hot with a sword
some itchy punk who wants to go
up against the great Porthos

DARTAGNAN
The great who
PORTHOS
The great Porthos
(when dArtagnan
isnt impressed)
Me you idiot

DArtagnan gives him a blank look
PORTHOS
Dont you know who I am
DARTAGNAN
The worlds greatest talker

Porthos couldnt be more insulted He sputters with
rage
PORTHOS
All right you little puke You
want to die So be it One
oclock behind the Luxembourg
And bring a coffin
DARTAGNAN
Bring your own

EXT STREETS OF PARIS - ALLEY - DAY 29
DArtagnan thinks he sees Anne and Constance races down
the alley turns a corner down a short street makes a
hasty decision runs down yet another alley and tum-

bles into a shadowy lane He stops looks left and
right And does see them

The ladies enter a chapels back door close the door
behind them DArtagnan flies after skids across cob-
blestones rips the door open and finds himself face
to face with the man who has escorted Anne and Constance
this far

DARTAGNAN
Let me pass

CARDINALS GUARD
Im afraid thats not possible

DARTAGNAN
I must speak to those young women

CARDINALS GUARD
The young women do not wish to be
spoken to

DARTAGNAN

CUT TO

INT ROOM 30

PAN ACROSS the Virgin Mary and many lit candles to a
BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third
Musketeer the dashing Aramis Aramis has a book open
and is reading from it

The Damsel suddenly grabs Aramis and kisses him on the
mouth Aramis politely extricates himself Hes not the
least bit embarrassed only slightly amused

ARAMIS

Madam Im flattered but I thought
you wanted me to tutor you in
theology

30
DAMSEL
Excuse me Monsieur Aramis But
when you started talking about
Original Sin I lost control and
became impassioned It wont
happen again

ARAMIS
Theres nothing unholy about
expressing ones emotions On
the contrary Religion should be
experienced in a passionate all-
embracing way We should feel
free to express our spirituality

DAMSEL
Yes darling
The Damsel attacks him again Suddenly a pounding on
the door
MAN (0S)
Open up

DAMSEL
(a gasp of fear)
My husband
ARAMIS
Your husband
DAMSEL
Aramis -- run

But Aramis heart is too noble He gets down on his
knees

ARAMIS
First we must pray to God for
forgiveness

Thats when the door bursts open and the ladys husband
an irate MARQUIS enters with a pistol His eyes blaze
with madness He aims the pistol at Aramis head

ARAMIS
On second thought Gods often
busy
Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window

As the Marquis aims and FIRES Aramis puts one foot on
the ledge and leaps into space The shot misses him by
inches

31 STREET BELOW 31
As dArtagnan runs past Aramis lands on top of him and
they go crashing to the cobblestones As they untangle
themselves and get up

ARAMIS
Thanks You broke my fall
perfectly But I do apologize
for the inconvenience
DARTAGNAN
(angry)
Get off me
DArtagnan pushes Aramis aside Aramis grabs dArtagnan
by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back

ARAMIS
If theres one thing I cant
abide its rudeness
DARTAGNAN
You fell on me
ARAMIS
And I apologized for it
DARTAGNAN
I suppose youd like to teach me a
lesson in manners too
ARAMIS
Id be honored
DArtagnan brightens Another duel
DARTAGNAN
Hows two oclock behind the
Luxembourg
Aramis bows politely

ARAMIS
If thats where you wish to die
I wont disappoint you Until
then

Aramis takes off dArtagnan swells with pride

32 EXT LOUVRE - DAY 32
The Royal Palace of Louis XIII

ANNE (VO)
Have you seen the King
SENESCHAL (V0O)
No Your Majesty

INT THRONE ROOM - DAY 33

Anne or rather Queen Anne steps into the throne room
a massive cathedral-like chamber Twin thrones occupy
a raised dais An entire wall is covered with a spectac-
ular map of the world The map contains every known
country and continent including the New World The
SENESCHAL exits closing the doors with a resounding boom
Anne pauses all alone in the big drafty chamber And
for the first time she looks and acts her age Barely
a woman chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings
and queens who came before her And a long way from
home Anne steps to the great map of the world She
reaches out to touch her own country Austria feels a
pang of separation We hear
MAN (0S)
Your Majesty

Anne reacts with a start A tall powerfully built man
stands in the shadows a spectre in red
ANNE
Cardinal Richelieu you surprised
me
Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness He smiles

RICHELIEU
How was your ride

Richelieus question takes her by surprise He bows
before Anne Considering a reply she extends her hand
The Cardinal kisses it

ANNE
My ride Well I Im not
sure
RICHELIEU

(rising up)
Forgive me
(MORE)

33
RICHELIEU (CONTD)
But your welfare is
more than a matter of personal
interest It is a matter of
State But rest assured your
secret is safe with me

His manner is both charming and paternal Anne smart
enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings

is nonetheless touched by his concern

ANNE

Thank you

Richelieu turns to the great map speaks gently

RICHELIEU
Youre homesick
ANNE
(after a beat)
Lonely Is that the same thing

RICHELIEU
Sometimes
Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne continues
RICHELIEU
Austrias loss is Frances gain
ANNE

Im not sure my new husband shares
your opinion

RICHELIEU
Nonsense Hes young not blind

ANNE
Mostly he is absent Ive barely
seen His Majesty since our wedding
and that was three months ago
Whenever hes around me he has
nothing to say

RICHELIEU
Arranged marriages can be
difficult Your father and I
thought yours would bring Austria
and France closer together 33
ANNE
Countries align more swiftly than
people Im afraid Louis and I
remain far apart
RICHELIEU
May I advise you
He says it with seeming humility not condescension Anne

nods assent

RICHELIEU
Louis was only nine years old
when his father was assassinated
He lost his childhood forever that
day I have watched him grow
toward manhood seen the toll his
life demands A boy who is not
allowed to be a boy sometimes has
difficulty becoming a man He is
shy yet boastful Giving yet

stubborn But most of all he is
not yet sure exactly who he is

The boy who lost his father Or

the King of France

ANNE

But how can I

RICHELIEU
Flatter him Make the boy feel
like a King So that the King
may be your husband

Anne considers his eloquent advice formulates a reply
when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull
boom the Seneschal chants

SENESCHAL
His Majesty the King

The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters He is
surprisingly young no older than dArtagnan His face
is handsome and intelligent

RICHELIEU
Your Majesty
LOUIS
Cardinal Richelieu Ive been
looking for you

As Louis strides toward them Richelieu and Anne bow 33
When Louis sees Anne he reacts with an almost imper-
ceptible start Her presence catches him off guard

LOUIS
Oh Anne Hello I didnt know
you were here

Louis hides his nervousness not to mention his love
behind a formal veneer Anne emboldened by Richelieus
confidences replies

ANNE
Would you like me to go
Louis suddenly remembers the reason hes here Determin-
ation breeds a more capable attitude

LOUIS
No Please stay
(to Richelieu aware
that she is watching
him)
Your Eminence I demand an answer

RICHELIEU
(hiding his amusement)
Perhaps if I knew the question
LOUIS
Ive just been told that you went
ahead and disbanded my Musketeers
RICHELIEU
You approved the decision
LOUIS
But not the timing of the matter
I intended to address them myself
explain the situation
RICHELIEU
Your Majesty France is on the
brink of war We dare not

hesitate

LOUIS
But these men are my personal
guards

RICHELIEU
They are the bravest fighters in
France

(MORE) 33

RICHELIEU (CONTD)
Well need them in the
field if were to win this war
with England Buckingham plans
to invade La Rochelle within the
month I thought it best to act
quickly --

LOUIS
I will be the judge of what is
best For me and for France

He says it with newfound resolve Richelieu receives the
rebuke with quiet grace Anne watches the latter closely
suppresses a smile The boy is nearer to King than
Richelieu imagined

RICHELIEU
Of course Forgive me
A tense beat Anne feeling out of place steps toward
the door
LOUIS
Anne Are you all right
ANNE

You two should continue this
discussion in private
LOUIS
(hesitates seeks a
reason for her to
stay)
Your thoughts on the matter
interest me They might help

ANNE
It seems to me that youre
doing very well on your own

She means it Anne smiles exits A beat Louis sighs
LOUIS
Shes beautiful

RICHELIEU
Extremely
LOUIS
Intelligent
RICHELIEU
Very

33 33
LOUIS
(after a beat)
Sometimes she scares me half to
death
RICHELIEU
May I advise you
Repetition reveals calculation Louis nods And the

Cardinal surprises with quiet humor

RICHELIEU
She scares me too As do all
women who join beauty to
intelligence Whats a man to

do
LOUIS
(enjoying the Cardinals
humor)
I have no idea
RICHELIEU

The course of love is full of
frightful turns But no matter
how you feel no matter how
hopelessly afraid never let
her know that you are anything
other than the bravest and most
confident man in France Make
that your starting point and
everything else will fall into

place

LOUIS
The bravest man in France

RICHELIEU
Good advice for a shopkeeper
Let alone a King

A beat Richelieu acting as the lost father And Louis
appreciating it speaking as a son
LOUIS

Your Eminence Im sorry that I

was sharp with you Its just

that the Musketeers well theyre
not just my guards Theyre my
friends too

RICHELIEU
I know But dont worry

responsibility for your welfare
Indeed he will

become a man

Which is all the more reason for
us to act quickly
ROCHEFORT

this portends)

DArtagnan walks proudly toward the Carmes-Deschaux
monastery bold and brave his future at hand Suddenly

COACH DRIVER (0S)
Get out of the way idiot

A speeding carriage bears down on him DArtagnan leaps

from its path stumbles He looks up in time to see the

passenger inside and for a moment time seems to stop

She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty her face framed
by the carriage window Long blonde curly hair that
cascades in ringlets to her shoulders languid blue eyes
and skin as white as alabaster She is known as MILADY

DE WINTER She is to sex what Constance is to innocence

DArtagnan watches as if in a dream The carriage the
beautiful woman inside it Paris wraps its arms around

the young mans heart Suddenly a second face enters the
carriage window replacing hers jarring by contrast It
is the fierce visage of Miladys Indo-Chinese Bodyguard
PARKER The bodyguard glares pulls at the carriage

window curtains taking Milady the dream from view

HOLD ON dArtagnan bewitched as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off
into the city

looking fellow incongruous in his elegant coachmans
uniform snaps the reins and guides the carriage away
Milady steps inside

ANOTHER ANGLE - POV
REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in
the shadows across the street COUNT DE WINTER forty-
five a kind face etched with sadness and ARMAND DE
WINTER twenty-five his son They are well-dressed But
their manner and appearance suggests that they have
traveled a long distance to find her

COUNT DE WINTER

Wait
He will not consider otherwise Armand sighs stands in
the shadows and watches his father cross toward Miladys

INT MILADYS HOUSE - DAY 38
Milady stands before a mirror reaches for one of the many
ivory combs that adorn her hair As she places the comb

we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm She

pauses to admire her beauty then to see the image of

Count de Winter now standing behind her his eyes dark

and cold Milady does not move from the reflecting glass

she smiles

MILADY
Count de Winter

COUNT DE WINTER
(as much happiness as
the thought allows)
We found you

MILADY
(eyes on the mirror)
Yes Now that you have what
will you do
COUNT DE WINTER
Bring you back To pay for what
you did to my son
MILADY
And if I resist
COUNT DE WINTER
(voice breaking with
emotion)
I will kill you with my bare
hands

The Count steps closer close enough to touch Milady
eyes bright with excitement the smile still playing about
her lips replies

MILADY
Well if thats the case Id
better start packing But first

EXT CARMES-DESCHAUX MONASTERY - DAY 41
The monastery is a windowless building bordered by a
barren field a dueling ground for men who have little
time to waste Athos sits on a stone bench waits for
his adversary to arrive His horse is hobbled nearby
DArtagnan rides INTO VIEW dismounts
ATHOS
Ten minutes early
DARTAGNAN
I have another appointment at one
ATHOS
Youll miss it Im afraid

DARTAGNAN
Ill try my best to be on time

Athos appreciates the young mans retort takes a closer
look Then he rises to his feet the pain in his arm
makes him wince

ATHOS
I asked two of my friends to act
as seconds but they are not as
punctual

DArtagnan notices Athos pained expression the blood on
his sleeve
DARTAGNAN

But youre wounded

ATHOS
Dont worry I fight just as well
with my left hand

41 41
DARTAGNAN
If youd rather kill me another
time
ATHOS
Thanks but I see my seconds
coming now

Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback They dismount
view dArtagnan with amazement DArtagnan reacts with
similar surprise smiles sheepishly

PORTHOS
(to Athos)
Whatre you doing You cant
fight this man

ATHOS
Why not
PORTHOS
Because Im fighting him
DARTAGNAN
Excuse me monsieur But not
until one oclock
ARAMIS
(amused)
Wait a minute Ive got a duel
with him too
DARTAGNAN
Yes sir But not until two
ATHOS
(to dArtagnan)
How long have you been in Paris
DARTAGNAN
I arrived this morning

ATHOS
Youve been busy

DARTAGNAN
Ive also fallen in love
ATHOS
(gruff to a fault)
Better to die for love than to
live for it Gentlemen

41 41
Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside He

draws his saber ready to fight A beat And in that
moment dArtagnans face reveals an emotion he has never
felt before in his young life Fear Athos sees it
allows him a moment to withdraw his saber DArtagnan
does so they square off touch sabers and

Jussac leads a patrol of the Cardinals Guards INTO
VIEW
JUSSAC
There they are
Athos and dArtagnan separate as Jussac and his four
swordsmen stride towards them

ARAMIS
Jussac Again
Athos steps forward to meet him
ATHOS

I told you the next time we met
Id want an answer But I didnt
expect you so soon

JUSSAC
The three of you are under arrest
The boys of no interest to me
and is free to go Do you intend
to resist

PORTHOS
Oh dont be stupid Of course we
intend to resist Just give us
a second

Porthos huddles with Athos and Aramis
PORTHOS
Interesting odds Five of them
and three of us
ARAMIS
It hardly seems fair Lets give
them the chance to surrender

DARTAGNAN
(interrupting)
Excuse me but there are four of

us

They turn and regard dArtagnan 41
ATHOS
This is not your fight Youre
not a Musketeer
DARTAGNAN

I may not wear the uniform but I
believe I have the heart of a
Musketeer

The three Musketters exchange smiles DArtagnans

youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism

PORTHOS
Bold and brave

ARAMIS
A poet
ATHOS
Have you got a name boy
DARTAGNAN
DArtagnan
PORTHOS
(startled)

DArtagnan
The name has meaning for all of them The Musketeers
look at each other deadpan shake their heads
ARAMIS
Impossible

PORTHOS
It couldnt be

Athos knows that it is He steps forward extends a
hand The others follow shake as well Athos intro-
duces each in turn

ATHOS
Athos Porthos Aramis
DARTAGNAN
Pleased to meet you How do you
do Good to see you again

Meanwhile Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing
impatience He clears his throat draws his saber The
Musketeers turn toward the Guards dArtagnan standing
among them 41
PORTHOS
Well Now that were all
acquainted
ATHOS
The Cardinals Guards
DArtagnan and the Musketeers draw their swords and
charge
FIGHT 42

Suddenly nine men are locked in mortal combat Athos
takes a Guard named Cahusac Porthos battles BISCARAT
and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once
DArtagnan looks for an opponent and finds himself
face to face with Jussac

The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-

ture of styles and techniques Athos is a brutal swords-
man his strokes overpowering and savage His repertoire
also includes swift kicks solid punches the occasional
elbow when necessary Aramis is a seamless and graceful
technician he handles his two opponents with balletic
ease an artist working with steel and flesh rather than
paint and canvas
And last and perhaps the most entertaining of all
Porthos He is a walking arsenal carrying a variety of
bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow daggers bolo
nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill
of a master Add this funhouse of armaments to his
already impressive size and strength and you have a one-
man wrecking crew of epic proportions
DArtagnans youthful energy is by now familiar He
bounds about like a newborn tiger encircles his adver-
sary changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-
rity Jussac is having a hard time defending himself
against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
directions at once
JUSSAC
(losing patience)

Stand still How do you expect

me to kill you if you keep jumping

around

MONASTERY 43

A monk watches from the bell tower incensed by the battle
raging on the field below He grabs the BELL rope gives
it a mighty pull and sounds a clamorous ALARM

BACK TO SCENE 44
Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation He
produces a pair of nunchucks Biscarat looks at the odd
weapon with professional curiosity slight confusion

and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head knocks

him to the ground

PORTHOS
(eyes on the tower)
Damn monks Always spoiling
everybodys fun

Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next
ARAMIS
They are nearer to God

PORTHOS
Theyre about to get a little
nearer to the hilt of my sword
ARAMIS
Pagan
PORTHOS
Papist

Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis opponents
Hed rather bicker from close range But Biscarat
struggles to his feet grabs his saber Porthos sees
him sighs
PORTHOS
(to Aramis)
Excuse me
ARAMIS
Im fine thank you

And Porthos returns to his original foe Meanwhile
Athos heavy strokes take their toll Cahusac staggers
wounded in arm shoulder grazed at the head -- and falls
to the ground with a thud Aramis calls out to him
indicates dArtagnan
ARAMIS
Take a look at our young friend

ATHOS
You mean hes still alive

Not only is dArtagnan alive but hes making a fool out
of Jussac Frustrated enraged Jussac makes a full lunge
at him but dArtagnan ducks then slips under Jussacs
sword like a snake and runs him through

44
Jussac falls to the ground lies still He is dead

Athos and Aramis react impressed Then turn their full
attention on weakening foes They disarm and disable

them with swift strokes Meanwhile Porthos chases
Biscarat into a grove of trees The Guard has discovered
the better part of valor now runs for his life Porthos
-- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish
bolo from his cloak and whips the balls over his head
Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound turns to face him
The color drains from his face

BISCARAT
Now what

Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about
the neck the balls slam into his head The Guard drops
to the ground without a sound
PORTHOS
God I love my work

AFTERMATH 45
A sudden silence save for the occasional dull groan

DArtagnan scans the battlefield sees Aramis bending

over Jussacs body speaking in solemn tones under his

breath
DARTAGNAN
(to Athos)
Whats he doing

ATHOS
Last rites Aramis takes death
very seriously

Porthos returns in high spirits stashes the bolo ina
pouch under his cloak DArtagnan sees the other weapons
there including a boomerang Maybe next time

PORTHOS
(re the bolo)
Do you know where this bolo comes
from

DARTAGNAN
(a bold jest given
the circumstances)
The Queen of America

PORTHOS
Spain

45
Porthos deadpans then grins acceptance All for one
and one for all DArtagnan beams
ARAMIS
Dont encourage him By killing
Jussac the boys made himself
an outlaw too
ATHOS
Not if he leaves Paris Which is
exactly what hes going to do
DARTAGNAN
I cant leave I just got here
PORTHOS
Go home find a wench live long
and prosper
DARTAGNAN
Why cant I stay with you
Aramis and Porthos look to Athos As always he will
decide
ATHOS

Because I do not want you to
Its hard to say whether hes acting out of concern for
the boy or he simply doesnt give a damn Whatever

the case dArtagnan is crestfallen The Musketeers
mount their horses Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier
tone

ARAMIS
I know Athos may seem cold and
unfriendly but dont let that
fool you

PORTHOS

He really is cold and unfriendly

ARAMIS
But hes also right This is our
fight not yours Go on get out
of here

DARTAGNAN
Whatever happened to the motto of
the Musketeers All for one
and one for all

ATHOS
Wake up boy The Musketeers are
just a dream 45

Athos spurs his horse rides away Aramis and Porthos
follow HOLD ON dArtagnan as he watches the Musketeers
grow small in the distance Then sadly he steps to his
horse climbs into the saddle It has been both the best
and the worst day of his young life

Thats when a group of horsemen come riding around the
corner of the monastery -- five Cardinals Guards led by
Rochefort himself They see their wounded comrades
Jussac dead and the three Musketeers escaping in the
distance

ROCHEFORT
(pointing)
There they go After them

But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase
dArtagnan rides into the middle of the field to
challenge them as if to further prove himself worthy
of the blue and gold
DARTAGNAN
(defiant)

Long live the Musketeers

And dArtagnan draws his saber

AT DISTANCE
The three Muskeeters rein their horses look back to

dArtagnans bold charge
PORTHOS
(with admiration)
Do you believe this kid

DArtagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them He
races through PISTOL SHOTS like a demon possessed
Rochefort rides to the lead draws his sword

ROCHEFORT
(shouts to the
others)
Fall back Ill take him myself

And like two jousting knights dArtagnan and Rochefort

meet in the middle of the field Their BLADES connect
with a resounding CLASH dArtagnan is knocked clear of
his saddle He hits the ground with a painful thud

Rocheforts Guards leap towards him

ANGLE TO INCLUDE MUSKEERS 46
Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by dArtagnans
courage
PORTHOS
Rocheforts got the boy
ATHOS
(seemingly unmoved)
Too bad
ARAMIS
You cant just leave him
Athos spurs his horse rides away Aramis and Porthos
exchange sad looks and hopeful comments
ARAMIS
He has a plan
PORTHOS
Definitely A plan
And with that they gallop after
BACK TO SCENE 47

Meanwhile dArtagnan is soon outnumbered and quickly
subdued
GUARD
This boy fights like a wildcat
DARTAGNAN
(exhausted)
Thank you

The Guard clobbers dArtagnan with the scabbard of his
sword The last thing dArtagnan sees is the three
Musketeers riding into the distance Then the WORLD
TILTS GOES SUDDENLY BLACK

A chamber in hell Spiders the size of rats rats the
size of small dogs A foul stench in the air DArtagnan
is sprawled in a corner unconscious on a filthy matted
floor The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest
DArtagnan wakes with a start springs back into action
As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux
He slaps the sword away leaps to his feet and reaches
for his own But it is gone

DARTAGNAN

My sword --

ROCHEFORT
Its magnificent Where did you
get it

Rochefort steps INTO VIEW the familiar eyepatch admiring
dArtagnans sword in his hands
DARTAGNAN
(after a beat)
It belonged to my father
ROCHEFORT
Your father

Rochefort studies dArtagnan for a long moment then
ROCHEFORT
Well now it belongs to me I
collect swords I take them
from the men I kill

DARTAGNAN
Im not dead yet
DArtagnan starts forward But Rochefort raises the

sword points it at his throat DArtagnan freezes
feels the sharp tip of the blade
ROCHEFORT
Soon enough

Rochefort shoves dArtagnan back to the floor with a
heavy boot A beat DArtagnan peers at his dismal
surroundings

Where am I

ROCHEFORT
Ill give you a hint Its not

DARTAGNAN

ROCHEFORT
Well youre the first person who
was ever happy to be here
Unfortunately your visit will be
a short one

DARTAGNAN
What do you mean

ROCHEFORT
You killed one of the Cardinals
Guards An offense punishable
by death

DARTAGNAN
He interrupted a duel I was
fighting

ROCHEFORT
Also punishable by death

DARTAGNAN
It was a long day

ROCHEFORT
You know them

DARTAGNAN
Who

ROCHEFORT

DArtagnan says nothing He will not betray them
Rochefort leans close

ROCHEFORT

Tell me where they are and I
will be lenient

DARTAGNAN
How 49
ROCHEFORT
(after a beat)
I will give you your fathers
sword
A long beat DArtagnan eyes the gleaming saber forged
in the Crusades He nods gestures for Rochefort to
come closer As if to impart a secret Rochefort tilts
downward dArtagnan rises up and whispers
DARTAGNAN
Give me my fathers sword and
Tll cut out your heart
Bold words bad timing Rochefort snarls slams the hilt
of the sword into dArtagnans head The youth slumps
from the wooden stool to the floor unconscious
ROCHEFORT
Fool Like your father
Rochefort storms from the cell He nods at a grizzled
jailer on his way out indicates the chains and manacles
on the cell wall The jailer scurries over to dArtagnan
inert in a shallow puddle of foul water He lifts drags
him toward the chains -- but dArtagnans eyes pop open
the jailer reacts with surprise and

CUT TO

The jailer exits from dArtagnans cell closes the heavy
door behind him A CLOSER look reveals dArtagnan in the
jailers soiled tunic eyes bright with adventure He
looks left and right -- dank corridors darkness the
OCCASIONAL GROAN And steps lightly into the shadows

ON DARTAGNAN 51

He seeks exit finds only a labyrinth Two jailers con-
verse step towards him DArtagnan leaps into a cell
doorway allows them to pass Suddenly scabrous hands
reach from inside the cell grab dArtagnan by the throat
He shudders leaps free And continues

DArtagnan steps deeper in the labyrinth Frustrated
no way out Just then more FOOTSTEPS heading toward
him DArtagnan seeks refuge watches as a cloaked
figure steps INTO VIEW accompanied by a retinue of
sullen jailers

DArtagnan thinks fast and joins them

ahead looking for a way out But the cloaked figure is
escorted up a long stairway into another hall and

toward a pristine wooden door DArtagnan watches as

the door opens revealing Cardinal Richelieu a fear-

some apparition in red the most powerful man in France

DArtagnans jaw drops The cloaked figure steps inside
The jailers disperse DArtagnan takes steps as if to
join them then turns back eyes the door the Cardinal
and the cloaked figure now behind it

ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR 53

The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal Richelieu
smiles concupiscent Rochefort stands in a corner
ignored for the moment
RICHELIEU
I have an errand that requires
your Singular talents

The figure rises The hood falls back revealing the
unforgettable features of Milady de Winter She answers
the Cardinals smile with a seductive expression
MILADY
I was beginning to think youd
forgotten me
RICHELIEU

Forget you Impossible
Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy two vipers
from the same pit

OUTSIDE DOOR 54

DArtagnan slips closer reaches for the handle finds it
unlocked He opens the door a fraction holds an ear
close

BACK TO SCENE 55
Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve
and hands it to Milady

RICHELIEU
Carry this to the Duke of
Buckingham

55
MILADY

(impressed)
You did it An alliance with
Buckingham

RICHELIEU

The King left me no choice Now
that hes come of age the boy
believes he should rule France
Instead of me

Rochefort knows what this portends He steps from the
corner
ROCHEFORT
Youre going to go through with
everything
RICHELIEU
(silences him with
a glance)
Yes Everything
(to Milady)
Youre to leave for Calais at
once A ship called the
Persephone will carry you to
England It sails Tuesday
midnight I want Buckinghams
signature next to mine before the
Kings birthday Friday
MILADY
Consider it done

RICHELIEU
And doing so shall earn you the
gratitude of a King

himself

DArtagnan lands with a thud at Richelieus feet
Rochefort hisses
ROCHEFORT
On your knees

When dArtagnan fails to respond Rochefort gives him a
mighty kick DArtagnan scrambles into the correct
posture of supplication Rochefort continues

ROCHEFORT
This is the boy who killed
Jussac
DARTAGNAN
I can explain that --
ROCHEFORT
Silence
Rochefort punches dArtagnan in the head knocking him to
the floor The Cardinal frowns

RICHELIEU
Rochefort Violence solves
nothing Leave him to me
DArtagnan reacts to the Cardinals reasonable tone
Rochefort makes a sullen exit The Cardinal smiles
RICHELIEU
Please Sit down
DArtagnan reacts with perceptible awe as if seeing his
first movie star He sits in a finely brocaded chair
looks at the Cardinal an apparition in red The Cardinal
speaks his manner casual friendly
RICHELIEU
How much did you hear

DARTAGNAN
(busted)
Not a word Your Eminence I
stepped from my cell for a breath
of air and became lost in the
corridors its dark as you know
but then I saw a light up ahead

Richelieu smiles dismisses dArtagnans tale with a
wave of his hand

RICHELIEU
You may have many talents my
young friend But guile is not
one of them Do you have a name

DARTAGNAN
DArtagnan

RICHELIEU

Ive heard that name before Are
you a Gascon

DARTAGNAN
Yes Your Eminence
RICHELIEU
Tell me What brought you to
Paris And dont say a horse
DARTAGNAN
I came to join the Kings
Musketeers
RICHELIEU
Bad timing

DARTAGNAN
So Ive heard

RICHELIEU
DArtagnan I like you I could
use a capable young man like you
in my Guards

DARTAGNAN
Im honored Your Eminence but I
dont think I would be very
popular with the other men Not
after today

RICHELIEU
I suppose not Your heart is set
on being a Musketeer

(off his look)

When I was your age I too had
dreams of joining the Musketeers

DARTAGNAN
(surprised)
You Your Eminence 58

RICHELIEU

Why not Becoming a Musketeer is
the fantasy of every young
Frenchman Or should I say it
was

(with seeming

kindness reason)
Like the Knights of the Round
Table the Musketeers have
outlived their usefulness They
are a thing of the past

(beat)
And so have your three friends
Tell me where they are dArtagnan
and I will spare your life

Richelieus seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice
DArtagnan sees it now replies quietly No longer in
awe but in opposition
DARTAGNAN
Im sorry But I cant tell you
what I do not know

RICHELIEU
In that case give my regards to
the headsman
DARTAGNAN
What about my trial
RICHELIEU
Youve just had it

Richelieu turns for the door means to dismiss him
DArtagnan calls after

DARTAGNAN
Wait --
RICHELIEU
Why Do you object to losing
your head
DARTAGNAN
Yes I like it where it is

RICHELIEU
Then tell me what I want to know
and perhaps you will keep it there
a few years longer
(beat)
Where are the three Musketeers 58
DARTAGNAN
I dont know

RICHELIEU
And if you did

DARTAGNAN
(after a beat)
I wouldnt tell you
RICHELIEU
I admire your courage young man
You might have made a fine
Musketeer after all

Richelieu opens the door Rochefort waits on the other
side
RICHELIEU
But well never know will we
Rochefort steps into the room grabs dArtagnan roughly
by the arm hurls him from the chair to the floor This

time Richelieu does not utter protest Instead he
turns to the Captain commands

RICHELIEU
Find the three Musketeers and kill
them

ROCHEFORT
Theyll be dead by dawn

RICHELIEU

A comforting thought Good night
dArtagnan Enjoy it Morning
comes quickly

his axe and touches the end of the blade cutting his
finger Razor-sharp The executioner holds up his

Richelieu appears beside him

ROCHEFORT
Milady left at midnight By
private coach

RICHELIEU

beautiful Ive ever known And
the deadliest Which would
explain my attraction

the scene)

How is our young daredevil holding

Down below the horse cart reaches the scaffold A man-
at-arms drops the tailgate dArtagnan steps down He is
taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS and
several men-at-arms carrying muskets

ANOTHER ANGLE 61

The Cardinals familiar carriage is parked a safe distance
from the square The Guards who attend it have wandered
off to watch the festivities The coachman remains

seated on top braiding his whip Suddenly a gloved hand
grabs the coachman yanks him from his seat

SCAFFOLD 62

DArtagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the
stairs to the execution platform The executioner and
the Priest wait patiently above DArtagnan sees the
bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie pales
The Priest mutters comfort

PRIEST
Fear not my son
DArtagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be-
neath the brim of his broad black hat He holds a
large Bible in his hands
PRIEST
For we are with you always
The Priest raises his face reveals it and winks It
is Aramis He whispers
ARAMIS

All for one and one for all

DArtagnans heart soars He turns to face the execu-
tioner Porthos grins beneath the hoods overhang
CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
Prepare the prisoner
Porthos lays his axe aside approaches dArtagnan in a
threatening manner He takes him by the scruff of the
neck and forces his head upon the chopping block The
crowd goes wild
PORTHOS
(whispers into his
ear)
Dont worry boy You wont

feel a thing
The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look
CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
Where is Father Rostand today

ARAMIS
The good father is all tied up

CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
Very well Proceed
Porthos nods

ANOTHER ANGLE

Men call it justice

ANNE
Are you surprised
She replies with contempt reins her horse away from the
square the crowd the executioners axe But Constance
freezes in place eyes wide As dArtagnan upon the
cart rolls INTO VIEW

For just a moment their eyes lock Inestimable space
between Constances eyes fill with tears she watches

his axe DArtagnan shuts his eyes wonders mutters a
silent prayer Thats when screams of panic erupt from
the crowd DArtagnan raises his head to see the source
of this mayhem

scattering the crowd in all directions Men shout women
scream all leaping to avoid the stallions sharp hooves

closest men-at-arms Aramis opens his Bible pulls out
a PISTOL and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the
Captain of the Guards A man-at-arms raises his musket
to shoot the false priest but dArtagnan leaps out of

ARAMIS
Your trip from home has been an
eventful one

DARTAGNAN
(he cant quite
believe it)

PORTHOS
I heard of a dArtagnan once He
was a captain in the Musketeers
when we were just recruits
DARTAGNAN
He was my father

ARAMIS
A good man Im told

PORTHOS
I knew there was something
familiar about this boy

75 75
DARTAGNAN
(sadly)
He died when I was nine
The mention of the elder dArtagnans death casts a pall
DArtagnan continues tentative the memory still hurts

DARTAGNAN
All my mother would tell me is
that he died in the service of
the King

An uncomfortable silence It is Athos who finally speaks
ATHOS
DArtagnan your father and another
Musketeer were ambushed and
murdered outside the Louvre
DArtagnan pales stunned and silent He manages a
broken whisper
DARTAGNAN
This other Musketeer -- is he
still alive Id like to talk
to him
Athos shakes his head Porthos adds

PORTHOS

On a battlefield defending
his King Fighting bravely for
France And now I will find
the man who murdered my father

A man is better measured by his
life than by his death Your
father was bold and brave

DARTAGNAN
But you never knew him

ARAMIS
He lives in you
Thats all the evidence Aramis requires DArtagnan
pauses to reflect Then wonders
DARTAGNAN
And your father

ARAMIS
I was orphaned at a young age
The church took me in
DARTAGNAN
You didnt have one
ARAMIS
But I did He was a great man
a leader of the church And his
example inspired me to dedicate
my life to Gods service

Aramis opens his cloak reveals a priestly cloth A
secret he carries near to his heart
DARTAGNAN
You were a priest
ARAMIS
I was a fool

betrayed the church and turned
his back on God To worship power

single word All turn wonder
ATHOS

bottom line)
Does the Cardinal know you have
this information
DARTAGNAN
Yes
ATHOS
Then he knows we have it too And
hell do everything in his power

meet the four ominous travelers

INNKEEPER
Good evening
ATHOS
See to our horses and bring us
some food
INNKEEPER
(apologetic)
Im sorry but we have little to
spare The Cardinals Guards were
here today They helped
themselves to our food and then
refused to pay
ARAMIS
(bitter)
In the name of God Im sure
Porthos is on the lookout for danger He reaches inside

The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos Porthos Aramis and
dArtagnan draw their swords ready to fight They stand
back to back in a circle ready for attack

But there is no attack Quite the contrary The people
here are thrilled to see them

INNKEEPER
(honored)
Musketeers in my house Gentlemen
put away your swords and come in
Anyone who fights the Cardinal is
welcome here

The Musketeers lower their swords 82
ARAMIS
I think weve found a home

The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and
take off their dripping hats and capes The pretty
Barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car-
ry it to the fire

INNKEEPER
We dont have much but what we
have is yours

Porthos rubs his hands together eager to indulge himself
He follows the Barmaids booming in his loud friendly
voice

PORTHOS
Ladies youre in for a treat
tonight Allow me to introduce
myself Im the Musketeer they
call Porthos
Porthos beams waiting for a big response but nothing
happens The Barmaids look at each other

Still no response Aramis and dArtagnan hide smiles

Its hard to believe they havent
heard of the great Porthos
PORTHOS
Oh shut up Aramis

The three Barmaids perk up
BARMAIDS

INT TAVERN - NIGHT 83
Moments later Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale
PORTHOS

I said A Queen is no different
than a barmaid in the dark Though
less practiced in the arts of
pleasure

The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee
But dArtagnan isnt so sure Porthos with two Barmaids

bellows a reply

PORTHOS
If youre going to be a proper
Musketeer youll have to learn
the manly art of wenching Right
ladies
The Barmaids heartily concur DArtagnan looks over
Porthos shoulder to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-
ously Porthos follows his gaze grins
PORTHOS
Ahh very good Your first
subject But youll need
instruction Watch closely
Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest brings
her lips toward his
PORTHOS
The secret to wenching is the
first kiss For in that kiss a
lasting impression is made If it
is weak she will think you are
weak And if it is comical she
will think you are a clown With

me
DARTAGNAN

Weak weak Comical clown
PORTHOS

Very good And as a Musketeer is

never weak and only rarely a

clown your first kiss must be all

the things that you are Like

this
Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss He breaks it
turns to dArtagnan with a grin

83
PORTHOS
You may speak first if you like
your name her name an endearment
or two But words are usually a
waste of time

ARAMIS
Only if you dont know which words
to say
All turn to regard Aramis Hell play along too
Porthos reacts with delight DArtagnan with interest
Aramis continues
ARAMIS
Words may make a more lasting
impression than a thousand of
Porthos kisses

BARMAID
(still reeling)
Not likely
ARAMIS
Ill demonstrate Please Sit
beside me
Aramis courtly behavior is as out of place in these en-
virons as it is persuasive The Barmaid slips from
Porthos lap sits down on the bench beside him
Aramis does not touch her He simply looks into her
eyes and begins to speak
ARAMIS
Shall I compare thee to a
summers day
Thou art more lovely and more
temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling
buds of May
And summers leash hath all too
short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven
shines
And often is his gold complexion
dimmed
And every fair from fair sometimes
declines
By chance or natures changing
course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not

fade
(MORE) 83
ARAMIS (CONTD)
Nor lose possession of that fair
thou owest
Nor shall death brag thou
wanderest in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou
growest
So long as men can breathe or eyes
can see

So long lives this and this gives
life to thee

The Barmaid once skeptical sits silently Her face
covered with tears Aramis pauses almost embarrassed by
the outcome He turns to dArtagnan cites

ARAMIS
Shakespeare
PORTHOS
Thats cheating
The Barmaid on his lap disagrees

BARMAID
Its beautiful
DArtagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the
room Porthos urges him on
PORTHOS
Come on dArtagnan We havent
got all night

DArtagnan steps forward The dark-haired Barmaid sees
him coming and smiles DArtagnan stands before her
hesitates not sure where to start Then remembering as
best he can
DARTAGNAN
Shall I compare thee to a summers
day
Thou are move lovely and more
tempest er more tempered
(beat)
Ahh to hell with it --

DArtagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms delivers a
powerful kiss As previously demonstrated Porthos and
Aramis smile proudly The Barmaids cheer

PORTHOS
The boys a natural 83
ARAMIS
So little time so much to learn

DArtagnan drains his flagon indicates Athos sitting at
a table by himself scowling working on his third bottle
of Burgundy

ARAMIS
In all the years Ive know him
I have never seen Athos smile

DARTAGNAN
Why is he sitting by himself
PORTHOS
Athos takes his drinking seriously
Ignore him Hell be his usual
warm charming self by morning
(calls out)
Service My lap is cold
A Barmaid scurries INTO VIEW Porthos grabs her by the
waist adds the Barmaid to the one already sitting on his
lap The chair breaks beneath them and all three go
sprawling on the floor laughing heartily

ATHOS 84

He remains lost in drink DArtagnan appears beside him
He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude
DARTAGNAN
Come join us
Athos pulls dArtagnan down with a dark smile He fills
his flagon for him

ATHOS
You fight like a Musketeer Lets
see if you can drink like one

DARTAGNAN
Ill drink anything you put in
front of me

ATHOS
Famous last words
(raising his flagon)
What shall we drink to

DArtagnan notices the dark-haired Barmaid eyeing him
across the room

DARTAGNAN
Love

The word nearly makes Athos grimace He stares at
dArtagnan for a long beat then beyond As if to look
into another time and place Finally

ATHOS
Love
(beat)

Would you like to hear a story

dArtagnan A love story
Athos voice reveals unexpected vulnerability the pain
he keeps inside DArtagnan is fascinated moved He
nearly whispers

DARTAGNAN
Yes
Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy
wipes the blood red wine from his lips
ATHOS
I once knew a man one of the
Counts of Berry My native
province When the good Count was
about your age he fell in love
with a visitor from Paris A
breathtaking girl of seventeen
She was more than beautiful
dArtagnan She was
intoxicating And this man the
poor idiot he married her

DARTAGNAN
Isnt that what people do when
they fall in love

ATHOS

(sharply)
Be quiet and listen
(beat)

The Count took her to his castle
and made her the first lady of the
province They were happy for a
time as happy as a man anda
woman can be Then one day while
riding in the woods the girl was
thrown from her horse and knocked
unconscious The Count hurried to
help her Her dress was torn

ATHOS (CONTD)
On her her arm the woman wore a
gold band in the shape of a
serpent It was the only article
of clothing she refused to remove
The Counts curiosity got the best

own the gold band He saw
omething on her arm something
ed kept hidden til then

DARTAGNAN

ATHOS

The fleur dlis Shed been
branded

85 ANOTHER ANGLE 85
DArtagnan reacts with shock
ATHOS
The Counts angel turned out to be
a murderess who escaped the
Executioners blade She swore
that she loved him Swore that
she had changed And if he would
just keep her secret they would
live a long life together
Athos pauses imagines that life The Count and his
angel
ATHOS
But the Count was young and he was
stupid He was tormented by the
ridicule of his social class And
so he rejected her For her lies
and for her past

(beat)
And turned her over to the
authorities to be executed for the
crime

Athos now turns his unflinching gaze on dArtagnan
ATHOS
But you see his heart did not
agree The Count soon realized
what she had meant to him And
what he had done
(MORE)

ATHOS (CONTD)

That his betrayal was far
greater than her own

(beat)
Soon after he foreswore the
society that shaped him Gave up
his title And was never seen
again

DARTAGNAN

He loved her

ATHOS
He killed her It seemed like the
same thing after a while

HOLD ON Athos for a long time As he gathers up his pain
and puts it back again

Athos SMASHES open another BOTTLE But the story has

made dArtagnan quite sober and a little sick to his

stomach He refuses another drink

ATHOS
Good More for me
PORTHOS
Aramis -- play something with some

blood in it I feel like dancing
Aramis launches into something appropriate Porthos and
a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance
Porthos is damned good His joie de vivre is infectious
and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging
him Every once in awhile another WEAPON -- a dagger or
something -- drops out of Porthos clothing and hits the
floor with a CLATTER

Thats when Porthos dancing with abandon spins out of
control trips and falls on Athos table crushing it to
the floor

Porthos lies in the wreckage staring up Athos totally
unperturbed looks down and offers him the bottle

PORTHOS
Care to dance Athos
ATHOS

Only if I can lead

Porthos blinks in amazement at Athos grim face then
breaks out laughing
PORTHOS
Aramis Athos made a joke

ANGLE 86
The Innkeeper comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt
and a sleepy expression

INNKEEPER
Excuse me gentlemen

DARTAGNAN

Were we making too much noise
INNKEEPER

You told me to wake you at dawn

ATHOS

enough Sunlight is peeking in through the cracks

The sun rises casts long shadows across a sparkling dew-
wet field DArtagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO
FRAME continuing their journey to Calais DArtagnan
squints ahead wincing with every bump Porthos grins
PORTHOS
Beautiful morning eh dArtagnan

DArtagnan is terribly hung-over from the nights
carousing He looks like he could puke at any moment
So thats exactly why Porthos shouts to him and says

PORTHOS
You know dArtagnan its not a
good idea to travel on an empty
stomach You really should have

had a big portion of those sheeps
brains

DArtagnan covers his mouth Porthos laughs good-
naturedly
DARTAGNAN
My head feels like its filled
with the Kings marching band
Would you please stop whistling

87
PORTHOS
Whistling Im not whistling

DARTAGNAN
Well someone is

PORTHOS
(to others)
The Barmaids kiss left him dizzy
ARAMIS
I hear it too It sounds like
ATHOS
(knows immediatley)
A connon ball

Athos is cut off by an EAR-PIERCING WHISTLE as a CANNON
BALL drops out of the sky and STRIKES the ground nearby
sending up a tremendous EXPLOSION
PORTHOS
I hate cannon balls

Another BALL EXPLODES into the ground in front of them
Their horses rear up in fear threatening to dump them
out of their saddles As the Musketeers and dArtagnan
struggle to control their horses they look back and see
an old castle atop a distant hill

A group of men operate two rusted cannons left over from
some long-forgotten war

The Musketeers barely calm their horses when another
BALL comes SCREAMING their way IMPACTING a few feet
away As dirt rains upon them

ARAMIS
(to dArtagnan)
Hows your head now

DARTAGNAN
Im beginning to wish the Cardinal
had chopped if off

ATHOS
Stay with us and you just might
get your wish
Athos spurs his horse across the field dArtagnan and
the Musketeers follow But they discover crude battle-
ments in their path Athos changes direction sees six

horsemen waiting for them in the near distance He
changes direction again as the horsemen charge after 87
They ride as fast their mounts will carry them A cross-
roads up ahead Athos sizes up the situation shouts
command
ATHOS
Split in half DArtagnan rides
with me

DArtagnan nods thrilled to go with Athos
ARAMIS
Well see you in Calais

Athos and dArtagnan take off in one direction Porthos
and Aramis in the other The pursuing horsemen soon
race INTO VIEW break in half to give chase

Its the least I can do

Richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure He steps closer
RICHELIEU
I am worried about the Kings

coming war with France These are
not the usual hobbies of youth

ANNE
No

And now he wishes to postpone his

ANNE

Why
RICHELIEU

He feels it is not appropriate
ANNE

It sounds as though he is
concerned with more important
matters

RICHELIEU
Which is exactly why we must

celebrate

(off her look)
To show the world that the King of
France is strong enough to face
any enemy on any field To show

France that he is King

He will listen to you If you

will speak

RICHELIEU
Im sorry to be late Your
Majesty but I was wrestling with
an important matter of state

Richelieu never allows the mask to slip Even for an
instant Louis glances at the throne room the increasing
number of Cardinals Guards on duty They make him feel
uncomfortable Louis speaks with renewed determination

LOUIS
Why is it I dont see any of my
Musketeers
RICHELIEU
Im afraid thats impossible
LOUIS
Why

92
RICHELIEU

They have become outlaws They
are terrorizing the countryside
robbing and killing innocent
people

Louis cant believe it

LOUIS
There must be some mistake

RICHELIEU
No mistake I have reports from
the local constables involved

Richelieu ever prepared produces a sheaf of papers No

RICHELIEU

They are better off disbanded
Louis turns back to the balcony the soldiers marching
below His mood glum and lonely He sighs moves on to

LOUIS
Your Eminence Ive been hearing
some very troubling rumors about
you

Richelieu nods not the least bit concerned

RICHELIEU
There are so many to choose from
Is it the one about my alleged
alliance with Buckingham Lets
see if I remember it correctly
While the English attack from

from within -- depose you -- and
become sovereign of France myself
That rumor Your Majesty

Richelieu smiles his face a mask of innocence

LOUIS
It does seem rather farfetched 92
RICHELIEU
If there are any doubts of my
loyalty theyll be put to rest
when we appear together at your
birthday celebration

LOUIS
Ive been thinking about that A
birthday celebration when were
on the brink of war

RICHELIEU

Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them

Porthos looks into the near distance manages a weary
smile

PORTHOS
Heres just the thing A nice
relaxing boat ride
At the bottom of the hill a crude ferry lands at the
bank of a swift choppy river
CUT TO
EXT RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY 94
The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform about

fifteen-by-twenty feet It travels from one shore to the
other by means of a ferry rope Transport is slow the
trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes

As Porthos and Aramis arrive the flatboat is just re-
turning piloted by its FERRYMAN a hunched and weather-
beaten gnome Four passengers wait to be carried across
-- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback and a country
WOMAN and her child As the flatboat enters its slip
the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board rudely
jostling the Woman and her child to the rear

The Ferryman an experienced boot-licker bows and
scrapes to the Cavaliers collects the coins they toss
to his way

FERRYMAN
A privilege to carry you on my
humble boat
The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child
FERRYMAN
Two pistoles

WOMAN
But I only have one Couldnt
my child ride free Shes so
small

FERRYMAN
(hand outstretched
demanding)
Two pistoles
A courtly voice intervenes

ARAMIS
Put away your money madame You
and your child will cross the
river under our protection For
free

94
All turn to regard Aramis on horseback Porthos at his
side The Woman reacts with grateful surprise The
Ferryman is outraged spittle flies as he curses and
protests
FERRYMAN

Nobody rides for free Under

your protection bloody well

indeed Ill teach you a thing

or two about protection Apple-

cheeked young fools -- Just who
do you think you are
ARAMIS

(waits for the
tirade to cease

simply)
Musketeers
Two two Cavaliers react to the word The Ferryman does
too -- into cringing obedient servant
FERRYMAN

Musketeers Well why didnt you
say so Of course youll ride for
free I insist on it This way
pretty madame My what a lovely
little girl

ARAMIS

Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so
he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the
hill on their horses
PORTHOS
We sail

And with that Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom-

erang and brings it down on the dock rope The rope
splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock

HILL AND SHORE 95

The pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of
the dock but theyre too late Porthos and Aramis have
gotten away

FLATBOAT 96
Porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers Aramis
ties scarves around the horses eyes to blindfold them
for the crossing Then he turns around and sees what
Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them
with keen interest
FIRST CAVALIER
Youre those Musketeers everyones
been looking for

PORTHOS
Popularity has its price

The First Cavalier smiles produces a flask
FIRST CAVALIER
I have some excellent brandy here
Would you gentlemen care to drink
a toast with us to the Cardinal
PORTHOS
Wed be happy to
Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak
PORTHOS
If youll drink one with us to
the King
SECOND CAVALIER
But the only King we recognize
is the Cardinal
ARAMIS
There are those who would call
that treason
FIRST CAVALIER
Happily no such objections have

been raised here
PORTHOS
All right Ill object

SECOND CAVALIER
Im listening

PORTHOS
Lets see You are by your dress
and by your manner members of a
bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers
whose slavish allegiance to His
Eminence the Cardinal is as that
of a dog who likes nothing better
than to sniff today where he has
peed the day before

measured tones his lips white with fury

FIRST CAVALIER

May I reply
ARAMIS
(courtly)
By all means
FIRST CAVALIER

Better to be a dog in the service
of a great master than a beef-
witted moron so dazzled by the
throne that he does not see the
true nature of the foolish boy
who wobbles atop it Which is to
say that most muddy-brained of
all men a Musketeer
The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords
Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own Porthos
deadpans
PORTHOS
Maybe theres something about us
that just pisses people off At
least Id like to think so Its
too bad we can only kill them
once

FIGHT 97

The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the
best place for a duel But the combatants make the most
of it Slipping sliding and falling They attack with
everything theyve got The Cavaliers are excellent
swordsmen And as if that were not enough the
Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must
keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades

97
Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a

devilish grin chases him between -- and at one point

over -- blindfolded horses

Aramis duels with the expected artistry gradually re-

ducing his opponent to tatters At one juncture the
child loses her footing slides toward the low end of
the flatboat the deep river beyond Aramis executes a
neat sidestep stops the childs desperate progress with
one arm while continuing to do battle with the other

He returns child to Mother with a grin continues

The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished groaning on the
flatboat deck Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle
breathless Porthos complains

PORTHOS
Ive been called a lot of things
in my time
ARAMIS
(eyes on the
opposite shore)
Porthos
PORTHOS
But beef-witted is a little more
than I can stand not to mention

unfair

Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat
approaches it There waiting patiently swords and
muskets already drawn is a patrol of Cardinals

Guards

sound of this)

No My horse can
ARAMIS
Thatll do
PORTHOS
But 97
Aramis hurries to his horse takes off the blindfold
Porthos grumbles after follows suit They leap atop
their mounts the horses slip upon the wet deck as they
guide them to the edge
ARAMIS
You go first and Ill watch your
progress
PORTHOS

No no Please After you

Stalemate Then they cant help it Aramis and Porthos
grin Life is an adventure lived to the fullest They
count

ARAMIS AND PORTHOS
One two -- three
And with that as the Woman and child the Ferryman look
on Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging
river The Woman whispers after
WOMAN
Thank you God speed
Porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance

ON SHORE 98
The Cardinals Guards react with anger and disbelief

RIVER 99
A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER Porthos clinging to
his horse for dear life Aramis keeping an eye on his
fellow Musketeer and the deep rapids up ahead

Through twists and turns walls of white water huge
boulders and gyrating whirlpools Aramis and Porthos
finally reach a quiet pool a leafy shore beyond They
lead their horses from the water step toward dry land
and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of
Cardinals Guards Waiting swords drawn for their
arrival

Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like
the others Aramis draws his saber mutters

ARAMIS
A nice relaxing boat ride

I can Go on without me

ATHOS

Ride to Calais and stop the
Cardinals agent

DARTAGNAN

ATHOS
Youre insane

produces a gold coin flips slams it between palm and
hand And looks between
ATHOS AND HIS POV 103
Heads DArtagnan is to remain Athos looks up without
missing a beat
ATHOS
Tails I stay

Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving
dArtagnan a chance to see
DARTAGNAN
But

Athos reloads FIRES below DArtagnan recognizes the
kindness he has received That Athos cannot fully express
it And that there is no use arguing with him

DARTAGNAN
At least take my pistol

He gives it to Athos They clasp hands
ATHOS
(gruff yet proud)
Dont let us down Musketeer
There are tears in dArtagnans eyes He knows Athos

hasnt got a chance

DARTAGNAN

Ill never forget you

Go
Athos turns away SHOOTS at another horseman DArtagnan
runs to his MOUNT GALLOPS away

106 DARTAGNANS POV - BLACK SCREEN 106
Out of the darkness a face appears BLURRY and OBSCURED
It FILLS the SCREEN slowly swimming INTO FOCUS It is
Milady de Winter even more beautiful in CLOSEUP
Familiar and no doubt deadly ivory combs gleam in her
hair She smiles warmly

MILADY
Welcome back Did you dream

107 ANOTHER ANGLE 107

reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn
DArtagnan regaining his senses finds himself propped
up in a large bed He blinks into the face of Milady
who sits at the edge His eyes widen with recognition
faint awe

DARTAGNAN
You
MILADY
Have we met
DARTAGNAN
I saw you in Paris

DArtagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged
He looks around the large room A FIRE ROARS in the
grate Food and drink have been set upon a table
DArtagnan continues still groggy uncertain
DARTAGNAN
Where am I
MILADY
This is Calais

DARTAGNAN
(with a jolt)

Calais

(muttered to self)

The ship Tuesday at midnight
DArtagnan leaps out of bed Then realizes he is stark
naked Milady smiles DArtagnan gathers a bedsheet
around him

DARTAGNAN
(frantic)
Where are my clothes

107
MILADY
Filthy Im having them cleaned
Is something wrong

DARTAGNAN
What day is it What time

DArtagnan runs to a window and throws open the shutters
Beyond the harbor lights of the Port of Calais

MILADY

near nine

DARTAGNAN

Are you sure

Its Tuesday
Nine

Somewhere in the night
smiles

a BELL TOLLS the HOUR Milady

MILADY
Quite sure

DArtagnan relaxes slightly
She wears a sky blue dressing
silken beneath it DArtagnan
joying his discomfort Milady

MILADY
Are you in a hurry

Milady rises from the bed
gown something soft and
reacts perceptibly En-
crosses the room joins

DARTAGNAN

(after a beat)
How did I
MILADY

get here

I found you in the road
Discarded Like an unwanted

kitten

Do you have a name or

shall I make one up for you

DARTAGNAN

(nervous)

My name is dArtagnan

MILADY
DArtagnan

the Countess de Winter Milady
DARTAGNAN

Countess

MILADY
My husbands dead 107
DARTAGNAN
Im sorry

MILADY
I have learned to live with death

She manages to combine sympathy seduction and just a
hint of danger All in a single reply DArtagnan
hesitates he is not immune to her charms then
DARTAGNAN
Countess Im very grateful for
what youve done but I cant stay
here Ive got

MILADY
What

DARTAGNAN
Important business

MILADY

How mysterious A handsome young
man with ‘important business in
the still of night Does it
involve a young lady

DARTAGNAN
No

MILADY
Does it require clothes

DARTAGNAN
Yes I need my clothes

MILADY
They wont be ready for at least
an hour

DARTAGNAN
An hour

MILADY

I told the innkeeper to bring them
when they are dry Until then

Im afraid you are my prisoner
Would the prisoner care for a
drink

Milady crosses to the table food and drink upon it As
she passes by the fire her dressing gown seems to disap-
pear revealing a silhouette that makes dArtagnans
heart stop 107
DARTAGNAN

(always innocent
never coy)

I am thirsty
Milady pours wine into glasses turns to face him And
offers a smile that dazzles and burns

MILADY

Good Then we will sit by the
fire and eat and drink and you
may impress perhaps even move me
with the story of how you came to
lie unconscious in the middle of
the night on the road to Calais

(soft seductively)
I love a good adventure

DArtagnan hesitates then steps to her

INT MILADYS CHAMBER AT INN - NIGHT 110

DArtagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front
of the roaring fire The plate of food between them is
empty They drink wine from goblets DArtagnan drains
his cup and stares into the burning embers Milady
speaks quietly with seeming compassion
MILADY
You are sad

DARTAGNAN
I was thinking about my friends
Milady knows when to speak and when to listen She
looks at dArtagnan with gentle expression allows him to
continue The warm room the wine her kindness All
conspire to loosen his tongue DArtagnan speaks
quietly from the heart

110
DARTAGNAN
The three best friends a man could
have We were separated on our
way to Calais Im afraid Ill
never see them again

MILADY
What brings you here
DARTAGNAN
Id like to tell you But I cant
MILADY
Important business

DArtagnan nods He wants to impress her He wants her
to know how brave he is And Milady is well aware of it
She looks down assumes a more vulnerable pose

MILADY
I understand Men make bold plans
in secret And women wait to

mourn or to celebrate the outcome
I know from experience its a
lonely vigil

DARTAGNAN
(after a beat)
All I can tell you is Im ona
mission for the King
MILADY
(looks up laughs
lightly)
Ive heard that one before
DARTAGNAN
Im serious
MILADY

You are a young man And young

men are given to exaggeration

However if you would like to

entertain me with a story Im

eager to hear it And please

make it very brave filled with

handsome knights and beautiful

ladies I know a dragon --
There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than
a woman who does not take him seriously DArtagnan acts
accordingly and reveals

110 110
DARTAGNAN
I came to Calais to stop a spy
from sailing to England
MILADY
(alert though
dArtagnan doesnt
see it)
A spy
DARTAGNAN
Yes
MILADY
I believe you
(beat)
Arent you afraid
DARTAGNAN
Musketeers are not afraid of
anything

MILADY
I knew it I knew you were a
Musketeer the moment I saw you
DARTAGNAN
You did

MILADY
Of course
(with sudden concern)
But dArtagnan if this spy was
to find out you are here your
life could be in grave danger
DARTAGNAN
A Musketeer is not afriad of
danger
MILADY
Im dangerous Youre not afraid
of me
Her tone heralds a sudden shift DArtagnan sees the
look in her eyes can almost feel her lips upon him
But he resists There is Constances memory to consider
And midnight as it approaches
DARTAGNAN
Youre not dangerous

MILADY
Then what am I 110
DARTAGNAN

Youre beautiful

Milady covers him with caresses DArtagnan resists
slightly but she presses closer she will not be denied

Milady leans close runs a fingertip along the line of

his jaw Her dressing gown falls open at the top enough

for dArtagnan to see her breasts as they press against

the silk beneath it Milady speaks as her finger traces
MILADY

Beauty danger They are the same
And with that she reaches up to her hair an ivory
comb

ON DARTAGNAN 111
He cannot continue Constance the hour a confusion he
cannot deny
DARTAGNAN
Im sorry --
DArtagnan pulls back -- just as Miladys arm arcs down
toward his neck holding a long sharp stick pin almost a

dagger attached to an ivory comb DArtagnan sees it in
the nick of time parries with his free hand knocking
the dagger to the rug Milady leaps after it hands out-
stretched DArtagnan follows battles for the dagger
stunned with fear and surprise

DARTAGNAN
Whatre you doing Have you lost
your mind

MILADY
You came to Calais to stop a spy
from sailing to England

DArtagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge Milady is the
messenger he is seeking He grabs the dagger rolls to
the side Milady staggers after the shoulder of her
negligee rips open DArtagnan sees the soft white flesh
reacts with shock recognition -- she bears the brand of
the fleur de lis The infamous mark of the murderess
Just as Athos told it to him Not so long ago

DARTAGNAN
My God

MILADY
(crying out)

Parker
The chamber door flies open Henri and Parker the Indo-
Chinese bodyguard appear Parker faces dArtagnan with
a half-smile He holds out his hands both empty And
steps toward him DArtagnan looks at the dagger in his
right hand Then unwilling to fight the man with an un-
fair advantage he tosses the dagger to the side steps
forward to meet him

Parker disposes of dArtagnan with lightning speed A
series of unexpected kicks brutally efficient blows
The young man is unfamiliar with and no match for the
martial arts Parker hoists dArtagnan to his feet
dazed Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions
Milady straightens her dressing gown adjusts her hair
and commands

MILADY
Kill him
Parker holds him fast Henri steps forward And
dArtagnan thinks fast
DARTAGNAN

You can kill me But a surprise
waits for you in England That
even Buckingham cant prevent
MILADY
(stops Henri with

a gesture)

What surprise

DARTAGNAN
Thats one thing Ill never tell
you

MILADY

DArtagnan You are young vain
and foolish But I do not know
if you are clever

DArtagnans expression reveals nothing Except to
suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping
Duly deceived though she doesnt know it Milady changes
her mind

MILADY
Well take him with us
(MORE) 111

convince you to share your final

he want
MILADY

(hollow laugh)
Justice Honor Revenge
DARTAGNAN

MILADY
He is the brother of my late
husband Lord de Winter He
blames me for de Winters death
He thinks I murdered him

DARTAGNAN
Did you murder your husband
Milady

MILADY

What do you think

A beat DArtagnan studies her pale beautiful face
Remembers Athos tale of love and loss
DARTAGNAN
I think hes not the first husband
you killed
(off her look)
I once knew a man one of the
Counts of Berry He told me a
story of beauty and danger
He was the bravest man Ive ever
known And the saddest

MILADY
I know

The truth strikes home Milady cannot conceal it But
she does not react with anger or scorn DArtagnan has
reminded her of the one thing in the world that still
touches her heart DArtagnan looks at her with a steady
gaze Milady cannot hold it she turns to the carriage

the fray And finds himself face to face with Parker the
Indo-Chinese bodyguard Parker has two Oriental swords
spinning in his hands One knocks dArtagnans sword out

He winks at dArtagnan returns to the fray DArtagnan
follows The Musketeers confront Miladys evil Bodyguards
in the night and fog Athos with brutal perfection
Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the
absurd And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --
and a marked determination to disable not kill his
opponents

Milady views the latter with alarm As the battle rages
around her she retreats into the shadows

Athos and dArtagnan find themselves fighting side by

side Athos observes dArtagnans technique -- the usual
frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown
ATHOS
Boy its a miracle youre still
alive fighting like that

DARTAGNAN
What do you mean

ATHOS
First always find your enemys
weakness Second take advantage
of it Watch me

One of the Bodyguards who wears a wooden leg attacks
Athos Athos kicks the false leg out from under him
knocks him to the deck DArtagnan repeats even as he
disables his own foe
DARTAGNAN

Find the weakness Take advantage

Got it
Aramis kneels at a dying man delivers muttered last
rites A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW means to kill him

past and what it brings

ATHOS
Give me the Cardinals treaty

MILADY
No
ATHOS
Then I will shoot
Athos cocks the trigger Milady whispers
MILADY
Be kind And aim for my heart

Athos face is a mask of contradiction He tries to pull
the trigger but it is not in him Milady recognizes

his pain with a nod She feels it too Then briefly
before she leaves him Milady speaks softly The past

Executioner ties Miladys hands behind her The
Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his
cloak Milady catches Athos eye He holds her gaze

image into his eyes so that he might keep it there until
the day he dies

Aramis reaches inside his cloak removes the sacred
priestly cloth he carries

Executioner brushes Miladys braid from her neck
exposing the soft white skin beneath He raises the
scimitar overhead and just as he is about to bring it
down a cry is heard torn from the heart

feeling it signifies has given her a kind of release
And the strength to face her fate

And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side snatch the

and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post

parchment now attached to his chest All For One And

happens Musketeers appear from every direction Some
from the surrounding crowd Some from buildings roof-
tops Others appear on horseback a few disguised as
monks And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
tunics
The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar The
corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos Porthos and

But Richelieu has found her first He steps to Anne
assumes an air of priestly innocence
RICHELIEU
Your Majesty

But Louis steps INTO VIEW puts a protecting arm around
his wife speaks stern command

LOUIS
Leave us alone
Thats when a loud BOOM rocks the room

ANOTHER ANGLE 157
The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific

blow Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into

further chaos The regiment of Guards rush forward

press their bodies against the door to secure it

BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half

Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic

His eyes narrow to mean slits he gestures toward Louis

and Anne across the room

RICHELIEU
(a cold whisper)
Kill him Kill her too

Rochefort draws dArtagnans sword from its sheath He
advances on Louis and Anne Louis has witnessed the

latter treason confirmed He raises his own sword
prepared to protect his Queen To die for her if
necessary
LOUIS
(to Anne)
Get behind me

Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King But
one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on
the Guards revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other
side Athos Porthos and Aramis at the lead

Louis breaks into a wide grin The Musketeers wade into
the Guards and the great hall is transformed into a bat-
tlefield Rochefort turns sees Athos charging at him
ATHOS
Greetings Monsieur Cyclops Are

ROCHEFORT
Not for long

Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel
BATTLE 158

Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack
But the young King has no intention of being protected
He wades to the fore fights side by side with his
Musketeers Anne watches him with a host of emotions
Respect admiration love Louis pauses to return her
gaze then returns to battle
Constance dashes through the fray She sees a Guard
slip behind a curtain approach the Queen She grabs a
heavy goblet shouts
CONSTANCE

Look out
Anne looks up Constance tosses the goblet to her Anne
catches it neatly brings it down on the head of the
hapless Guard Constance smiles leaps forward

Aramis cuts down a Guard As another man comes at him
from behind Porthos intervenes runs the man through
The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks
and continue
Athos and Rochefort slash at each other It is a mighty
confrontation But Athos soon gains the upper hand
Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help Now its
two on one Athos receives a wound in the shoulder he
staggers and the treaty falls from his tunic to the
floor Rochefort reacts with a start he grabs the
treaty stuffs it into his doublet Athos shakes off
the sudden pain disposes of the Guard Rochefort and
Athos face each other a second time Athos wounded

Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer

But Athos merely changes sword hands Rochefort reacts
Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together Rochefort
grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand But
Athos sees it coming and smashes Rochefort across the
face with his fist

158
Rochefort goes sprawling He loses his sword it slides
across the floor until someones foot stops it
Rochefort looks up and sees dArtagnan standing on
the blade
DARTAGNAN
This sword belongs to me

DArtagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword He
tosses his other saber to Rochefort who catches it
neatly Athos watches from a short distance knows
this moment belongs to dArtagnan He will not intervene
But he shouts
ARAMIS
DArtagnan Kill him where he
stands
These are dArtagnans words A son vowing to avenge the
death of his father DArtagnan wonders Rochefort
confirms
ROCHEFORT
By all means Lets discover if
you are as brave a man as your
father was And as foolish
DARTAGNAN
(stunned by the
revelation as it

unfolds)
What
ROCHEFORT
He died for his King and for
France But most of all he

died on the end of my sword
(the final curse)
As will you
Rochefort smiles a taunt DArtagnan raises his sword
whispers to heaven
DARTAGNAN
This is for you Father

Then eyes blazing dArtagnan attacks Rochefort with
everything hes got driving him into an adjoining
chamber

ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER 159
A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth Its light pro-

jects giant shadows on the wall as dArtagnan and
Rochefort duel slashing at each other

Cardinals Guards Each with his by-now familiar

tradmarks King Louis fighting beside them

DARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT 161

They battle before the blazing fire sweat covers their
faces Rochefort wears a wolfish grin But dArtagnan
has learned his lessons well He attacks with gusto
Rocheforts grin soon turns toward desperation He
cannot match the boys vengeful steel So he drives a
knee into dArtagnans groin DArtagnan falls to the
floor Rochefort means to finish him there But
dArtagnan rolls away from the blade leaps back to his
feet Undaunted he hurls himself at his hated opponent

Rochefort sidesteps throws dArtagnan against a wall
He pins him there stunning the youth And hisses with
superior disdain
ROCHEFORT
One things certain Youre no
Musketeer
But dArtagnan remembers Athos advice Always find
your enemys weakness He shoves a thumb into
Rocheforts good eye Rochefort stumbles backward
DArtagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclopss
heart
DARTAGNAN
Take it back

ROCHEFORT
I might have been mistaken

Rochefort crumples to the floor dead DArtagnan looks
at Rocheforts blood on his sword His fathers death
finally avenged Thats when he hears the RUSTLE of a
SILKEN ROBE DArtagnan pivots sees Richelieu kneeling
at Rocheforts body extracting the treaty from his
doublet
DARTAGNAN
No

Richelieu smiles hurls the treaty into the blazing
fireplace As the flames begin to lick at the parchment
paper dArtagnan flies past the Cardinal and dives
after to retrieve it

Athos Porthos and Aramis enter the room DArtagnan
stumbles out of the fireplace covered with soot
clutching the treaty He grins ON dArtagnans look
of triumph

RICHELIEU
Your Majesty that document is an
obvious forgery I am clearly the
victim of a conspiracy designed
and perpetuated by these three
Musketeers

Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose one familiar to
both King and Queen
LOUIS
This is a complicated matter
Your Eminence affecting both
France and the crown
A beat As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude
blame after all But Louis continues with quiet author-
ity just a trace of humor As King and as a man
LOUIS
And so until such time as I and
my advisors --
(gestures toward
Anne the
Musketeers)
-- can determine the whole truth
of the matter I invite you to
await our decision in the comfort

road He holds it out to her The King wonders the
Queen smiles 162
ANNE
Thank you dArtagnan But the
bracelet does not belong to me

Anne indicates Constance who steps forward INTO VIEW
DArtagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time
The thrill of recognition the promise of romance
charges between DArtagnan slips the bracelet around
her wrist Constance kisses him on the cheek Louis
continues

LOUIS
DArtagnan I am in your debt
What can I do to repay the courage
youve shown me Anything
DArtagnan Whatever your heart
desires
DArtagnan knows what he wants But he is tongue-tied
unable to ask for it Athos asks for him
ATHOS
Majesty his heart has only one
desire To become a Musketeer
DArtagnan looks at Athos thankful for the intercession
Louis answers with pleasure
LOUIS
Then kneel dArtagnan
DArtagnan drops to his knees Louis lays the blade of
his sword on each of his shoulders
LOUIS

he weak are oppressed by the
trong But there are those who
ppose these powerful forces

truth honor and freedom They
are a constant reminder to all of
us That such a life is not just
possible but necessary to our
continued survival As a country
