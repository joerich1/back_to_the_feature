EXT MOUNTAIN RANGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

An unparalleled set of sheer mountains -- part of the Colorado
Rockies The peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out
of the valley -- wind-whipped snow mists over the mountains
like a low fog The tranquility is broken as a helicopter
BLASTS into view fighting the wind as it heads for the center
of it all

Our CREDITS fly us past and through this magnificent range
There are sky-piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow high
pinnacle -- and others that are steel straight-up approaches
to large plateaus One of the mountains has a crystal lake on
top -- with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the
middle of a mountain wall Nearby an abandoned cable ladder
is bolted into the same wall leading to the top

BACK IN THE HELICOPTER

We can see a man sitting in its doorway looking out --
INTEXT HELICOPTER - BINOCULAR POV

The glasses scan systematically slowly -- to us it looks
like nothing more than a field of gray and white

FRANK (0S)
Nothing yet

EXT THE MOUNTAINS - LONG SHOT

The helicopter now circles this tallest mountain -- The
Tower separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by
a chasm of two hundred feet -- that drops 3500 feet below

INSIDE HELICOPTER - FRANK AND MAGGIE

Spotter FRANK NEWELL (50s) scans the mountain wall MAGGIE
DEIGHAN (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm
winds Both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as
members of the Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team
FRANK
Wait a minute -- theres Hal
(beat)
And his date

BINOCULAR POV - A LEDGE

thats part of the smaller peak HAL TUCKER (30s) and his
date SUSAN COLLINS (20s) are decked out in climbing gear
Hals aplomb suggests hes a veteran climber -- Susans
worried look shows she isnt Hal and Susan huddle together
both cold but okay Hal has a makeshift splint wrapped
around his lower leg and a slow burning flare in one hand

INSIDE HELICOPTER
Frank lowers his glasses -- Maggie struggles with the wind

MAGGIE
How do they look

BINOCULAR POV - HAL AND SUSAN

Hal now aware of the copter looks towards it smiling -- and
starts jerking off the flare

FRANK (0S)
Hes signalling okay

MAGGIE (0S)
Wheres Gabe

The POV dips down -- theres somebody climbing below in an
orange rescue jacket

FRANK (0S)
Right where hes supposed to be

CLOSER ON THE CLIMBER

This is GABE WALKER (30s) In spite of the cold and the snow
hes fearlessly swiftly scaling the tower without safety
lines as if hes done it a hundred times Thats because he
has done it a hundred times This is what Gabe lives for

ON THE LEDGE

Gabe almost there finds a fingertip-width handhold at arms
length -- grabbing it he pulls himself up on the ledge with a
move thats just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a
doorjamb Winded Gabe slumps down next to the couple and
tries to light a cigarette The lighter only sparks

HAL
Excuse me -- I know youre my
salvation and all -- do you think you
could rescue us before your smoke

break

Hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one Bogart
style one-handed with a thumbnail cupping a hand to shield
it against the wind Gabe bends down for it -- a familiar
routine We know in a glance theyve been friends for years

GABE
Maybe you could tell me why I am
rescuing you

HAL
Basically -- Ive fallen down and I
cant get up
GABE
(into radio)
Rescue One -- have located helpless

climber please prepare idiot line
for transport over --

THE HELICOPTER dips down towards the ledge -- no way can it
land there Frank lowers a rescue wire to

GABE

who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it -- the
wire is just out of reach Hal grabs the radio

HAL
Rescue One -- please remind me to tell
you about the time I hauled your hero
here down Mt Huntington on my back
over --

MAGGIE (0S)
(through radio)
Hal if I hear that story one more
time Im making you limp down the
entire three thousand feet over --

Gabe finally grabs the line secures it to a heavy piton and
hammers it into the wall

GABE
(to Susan)
This guy showing you a good time
THE HELICOPTER

swings over across to the facing mountain -- Maggie lands the
copter in spite of the winds on a small plateau Frank gets
out to secure the wire -- theres now a lifeline spanning the
chasm

ON THE LEDGE

Gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock -- he
extinguishes his cigarette in the snow and naturally pockets
the butt Hal propped up against the wall expertly rigs a
seat harness around his legs -- Susan helps him get part of it
around his splint and Gabe clips it to the line

GABE
Now remember -- keep your arms and
legs within the vehicle at all
times --
HAL
(laughing)
Fuck you --

With that Hal pulls himself hand-over-hand across the sloping
line -- Hal makes a point of looking down --

HALS POV -- THE DROP

is vertigo defined Thirty five hundred feet straight down
You could stack the World Trade Center towers on top of each
other and theyd still be shorter than this mountain is high
However --

HAL

lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face
in mock horror -- he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet
of the line where Frank catches him and pulls him out Hal
gets out of the harness checks every stitch of it signals
thumbs-up and sends it back

THE LEDGE

Gabe retrieves the harness on a small attachment line and
gives Susan a reassuring smile but shes still sensibly
very scared Gabe recovers the harness rigs Susan into it
and meticulously re-checks it

GABE
Ready

(sees shes afraid)
Did he tell you about the time he
almost made it up Everest

SUSAN
He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask

GABE
Well if hes bored you with that
bullshit then this has to be the best
part of a bad date Right

Susan nervously laughs

GABE
Ready

SUSAN
(scared but tough)
Okay --

Gabe starts to push her out on the line but she grabs his arm
in a panic

SUSAN
I cant --

Susan starts to tilt her head down -- Gabe gently takes hold
of her chin turning her view up to face him

GABE
Yes you can
(reassuring)
You can do it Dont look down The
whole way across dont look down
Look at me Just keep looking at me --
and youll be okay

Susan looks at Gabe -- trying to be confident -- nods
GABE
Sure
SUSAN
Yeah
(beat)

I have always depended on the kindness
of Rangers

Gabe grins and gently pushes her out Susan tentatively pulls
herself across -- then develops a rhythm building speed --
GABES POV - SUSAN

inching away in the harness looking more confident now --
SUSANS POV - GABE

signalling OK -- youre doing fine --

SUSAN - ANOTHER ANGLE

thirty feet out going fine --

INSERT -- A HARNESS CLIP

holding the strap under Susans left leg breaks --

GABES POV - SUSAN

The harness completely unravels all at once its strands
shoot through the clips -- what was a seat has become a trap
door in half a second -- as the harness shoots out from under
her Susan falls but grabs the harness strand --

HAL

is helpless and can only watch as

SUSAN

too scared to breathe dangles on the remaining strand of what
used to be the harness -- she sways from the wind and the jerk
of her own weight her grip loosens --

INSERT - THE TOP CLIP

that is supporting all of Susans weight is being seriously
tested -- a single knot in the harness has caught there but
it clearly wont last long --

GABE
moves back from the ledge

GABE
(loud in control)
Hold on Im coming out to get you

Gabe gently pulls himself up on the line crosses his ankles
on it and clips himself on with a three foot safety line
Gabe starts smoothly quickly pulling himself out but --
SUSAN

is in trouble -- the bobbing of the line from Gabes weight
and the winds are making her lose her grip even more --

GABE
urgently pulls himself along the line faster trying not to
shake the line As he gets closer and closer to a terrified

Susan his eyes lock on hers --

GABE
Keep looking at me Hold on --

WIDER ANGLE
Gabe is only ten feet away from --
SUSAN

who stares at Gabe petrified -- this focus is helping but
her strength is just about gone --

INSERT - THE CLIP

The knot has worked itself halfway through -- it doesnt make
any difference how tight she holds on to the harness the
harness itself is letting go --

ON GABE

who knows it and pulls himself the rest of the way a little
faster almost bridging the gap --

ON SUSAN
staring desperately at Gabe holding on --
INSERT - THE TOP CLIP

thats keeping Susan alive surrenders the knot -- it passes
through and

SUSAN
falls --
GABE

deliberately lets go of the main line and launches himself
at Susan --
TO

THEIR HANDS
miss --
ANGLE ON BOTH

Gabes three foot safety line pulls taut testing the limits
of the line above as it yanks him back --

GABES POV - SUSAN

is just out of reach -- her hand is still stretched out her
eyes still locked on

GABE

who can only look down swaying helplessly on the wire as
Susans SCREAM starts --

ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

Frank and Maggie look down in horror but neither look as
anguished as Hal --

LONG SHOT - SUSAN

falling -- falling -- falling -- looking very small against
the vast mountain range --

SUSANS POV - FALLING

from this height takes the longest nineteen seconds you can
imagine --

GABE

twists from his safety line spinning helplessly -- he wants
to but cant shut his eyes --

GABES POV - THE CHASM

Susan is gone Her SCREAM cut short echoes -- the safety
harness spirals down after her like a carefree bird --

SMASH CUT

INTEXT SMALL AIRLINER - GABES POV OUT WINDOW - DAY

As the plane dips to land Gabe can see a bird circling far
below over the same mountainous terrain
INT SMALL AIRLINER - GABE

sweating panting awake It hasnt been that long since the
accident -- a year to be exact -- but he looks older He
looks as if hes watched Susan Collins drop at least one
hundred times Gabe reels himself in as a STEWARDESS hands him
a glass of water

STEWARDESS
Take this
(Gabe does)
Afraid of flying
Gabe shakes his head
GABE

Falling
INT TERMINAL - DAY

Gabe with no luggage is at the small airports only car
rental counter doing the paperwork for a RENTAL AGENT

RENTAL AGENT
Midsize

GABE
Any size any color any model

RENTAL AGENT
How long will you be needing it

GABE
(flat)
Just under six hours

MAGGIE (0S)
You arent wasting any time are you

Gabe turns and looks at
MAGGIE
who is standing off to the side

MAGGIE
I knew youd be coming by Today

Gabes happy to see her -- but at the same time he isnt
She looks too good -- and she brings up quite a mixed bag of
memories Maggie carves on a smile
MAGGIE
If youre in that much of a hurry why
dont you ride with me

INT RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY
Maggie pilots the copter heading out toward the mountain

range Gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside Both
grope for a way to start the conversation

GABE
This is new
MAGGIE
Its a thermal scope -- picks up body

heat of lost hikers --

Gabe flicks it on looks at the total absence of heat as they
fly over the snow

GABE
Still find the dead ones the old
fashioned way I guess

So much for small talk Gabe is clearly uneasy watching these
mountains go by Maggie breaks an awkward silence --

MAGGIE
You could have said goodbye

GABE
(shakes head)
If I did Id have to listen to you
tell me one more time that it wasnt
my fault

MAGGIE

(angry)
Today -- especially today -- you get
to hear it again The harness clip
broke Cold stress -- one ina
million equipment failure You and
Hal could have checked it from then
till now and it still would have
happened

(beat)
You did everything right --

GABE
-- If I did everything right Susan
Collins would still be alive
THE HELICOPTER

whizzes on to the Ranger station -- a small building by an old
country road Not much activity outside of some ROOKIE
CLIMBERS working out on a CLIMBING PRACTICE WALL Maggie
starts to land the copter and as she does --

INSIDE THE COPTER

GABE
Do you really believe all that That
it wasnt our fault

Maggie slows the rotor her eyes on the controls Gabes eyes
are locked on her

MAGGIE
(turns to Gabe)
Yes Yes I do

But she answered a half beat too slow The helicopter touches
ground

GABE
Im not sure what I wish more Maggie
That you meant what you said just now
-- or that it were really true then

EXT RANGER STATION

Hal wearing Sheriffs garb storms towards Maggies side of
the copter as the engine shuts off and the rotor dies

HAL
Maggie where the hell have you been
Ive got two climbers out --

Gabe gets out of the copter and Hal sees him for the first
time Unlike the last time we saw them neither man is glad to
see the other Hal turns on Maggie

HAL

Brett and Evan are up there again to
jump off the spur Their wives called
twice I want you in the air and I
want them found before the storm
system moves in

(Maggie hesitates)
Now

Maggie takes off as Gabe and Hal step away from the copter
Gabe eyes Hals uniform and almost -- not quite but almost --
laughs

GABE
Christ Youre in charge of Rescue
now

HAL

There was a vacancy Maybe you heard
about it The last guy lost his nerve
and lit out of town

GABE
Well youre a better man than I am
Hal Nothing rattles you

The rookie climbers get off the practice wall to watch this
faceoff Gabe and Hal are one crack away from beating hell out
of each other Frank heads over to defuse the confrontation

FRANK
(steering Gabe away)
Gabe Long time son -- why dont you

come meet some of the new guys --

GABE
Good idea Say Hal
(beat)
Why dont you come with me so we can
show these rookies how to death-rig a
woman properly

That tears it -- Hal rushes Gabe and they pummel each other
until Frank and the others pull them apart panting and
bleeding Hal throws off the men holding him back -- but
instead of going at Gabe again Hal throws Gabe a set of car
keys

HAL
Take the Bronco to where youre going
Ive already been Then go back to
wherever it is you like to hide And
stay there

Hal heads back into the office -- Gabe heads for the Bronco
CUT TO
EXT DENVER MINT - HIGH ANGLE - DAY

The Southwest regional center for printing and distributing
currency Hundreds of troops stand guard over the impressive
US Treasury complex

INT TREASURY COMPOUND - A HUGE PRINTING PRESS

is at work -- the ROAR of its parts is deafening as it stamps
out a plate design on huge sheets of paper -- we move in on
THE PAPER

which is moved by mechanical arm to a SLICER that razors the
bills apart -- its moving too fast for us to see the
denomination -- the cut bills are separated by --

FOUR SEPARATION CHUTES

that fire the bills down to a mechanical COUNTER that
serializes counts bands and stacks them faster than any
human could -- a HAND reaches to pick up a band --

THE BILLS

are something a banker could work a lifetime without seeing
but are real nonetheless -- 5000 bills banded here in
hundreds The band is put back in the growing stack by

RICHARD TRAVERS

mid-thirties a tough imposing Treasury agent -- he regards
the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold
professional interest Travers is flanked by a trio of equally
tough TREASURY AGENTS -- he turns to flunky DAVIS (20s) Its
clear whos in charge of protecting the money here and whos
in charge of counting it

TRAVERS
Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment
is ready

DAVID

(phone already out)
Right away Mr Travers

As Davis dials we move to --
THE OFFICE

of WALTER WRIGHT (50s) comptroller of currency -- his
demeanor suggests hes in control and used to keeping it that
way

WRIGHT
(into phone)
Good -- good Ill be right down

As Wright gets up from his desk though we hear in the outer
office --

SECRETARY (0S)
You cant go in there --

MATHESON (0S)
Watch me

KURT MATHESON (30s) bursts into the office trailed by
Wrights flustered SECRETARY

MATHESON
Walter Wright
(flashes badge)
Matheson FBI We need to talk

PRINTING COMPOUND - THE MONEY

has now been packed into a trio of metal briefcases -- ten
thousand 5000 bills Travers shuts the cases in turn and
locks each with an electronic key card triggering a FLASHING
RED LIGHT on the locks as he does A uniformed PILOT shows up
behind Travers as he cuffs the cases to the hands of the three
other agents

PILOT
Well be fueled and ready in ten
minutes Mr Travers

TRAVERS
(an order)
Be ready in five

MATHESON (0S)
Go ahead and take ten Well need the
time

Travers looks up at Matheson who has just arrived with
Wright Travers is instantly furious at the challenge to his
authority

MATHESON
(flashes badge)
Matheson FBI

TRAVERS
(looking down at it)
Your parents must be proud
(to Wright)
What the fuck is this about

WRIGHT
Small problem with the shipment
Travers
(to Matheson)
Tell him what you just told me

Matheson draws out a file and hands it to Travers

MATHESON
We got word that somebodys been
observing your currency shipments --
this load the 5000s -- over the
last three deliveries

TRAVERS
(laughs)
There isnt a hell of a lot anyone can
do but observe

(beat)
This is the most protected shipment
weve got -- and the most useless for

a thief Those bills arent in
circulation You think five thousand
dollar bills are easy to pass Who the
fuck would try

Matheson hands Travers a folder

MATHESON
This guy might

We look over Travers shoulder at the photos which are all
blurry all blown up from different surveillance pictures --
and all of them show ERIC QUALEN

TRAVERS
Who is he

MATHERS

(patient)
His names Eric Qualen One of the
East German spies who got shut out by
the reunification The CIA issued an
inter-agency warning about him right
after the wall came down Hes got
nowhere to go and nothing to lose
Hes also got the international
connections to get rid of bills like
these -- and hes probably desperate
enough to try for them Fifty million
bucks buys a lot of sanctuary

TRAVERS
Could you get to the part where Im
supposed to care

MATHESON
(shows him more photos)
We had two agents monitoring him
These two -- Gleason and Quinones
Their last report said he was going to
try to take this shipment

TRAVERS
(turning away)
Thanks for the tip But Ive got work
to do

MATHESON
(stopping him)
Did I say last report I think I
did I mean last fucking report
These guys have vanished

TRAVERS

You have my sympathy but --
(exasperated)

Theres a reason we do things this
way all right Armored cars can be
hijacked Trains can be derailed But
nobody can get to us in flight The
only time this is on the ground is at
the mint or on the Presidio runway in
San Francisco Either way someone
would have to shoot his way past a
couple of thousand guards

Matheson still isnt convinced

TRAVERS
If youre worried about an inside job
forget it I checked the plane from
top to bottom an hour ago And these
three are my best against Even if one
of them did go skydiving they
wouldnt get far Each case has an
electronic tracer with a range of one
hundred miles

Travers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman
out of his jacket pocket The small screen shows three red
blips at rest -- matching the three currency cases
TRAVERS
(facing down Matheson)
I havent lost a bill in eight years
And Im not scrubbing this shipment
because you scare easily

MATHESON

(an easy smile)
Who said anything about stopping the
shipment

(beat)
Ive been tracking Qualen for almost a
year If he pulls something I want to
be in on the party

Travers angry turns to Wright Wright clearly doesnt like
this either but is resigned to it

WRIGHT
This is cleared from the top Travers
Matheson will accompany you on the
flight to San Francisco
(beat)
Show him every professional courtesy

Travers turns back to a smiling Matheson looking like hed
rather kill him instead as we --

CUT TO
EXT MOUNTAIN RANGE - MAGGIES HELICOPTER

is being buffeted by storm winds and a light snow -- Maggie
struggles hard with the controls but --

INSIDE HELICOPTER
Visibility is near zero Maggie keys the radio

MAGGIE

HAL (0S)
Rescue One -- have you sighted them
Over --

MAGGIE
Negative Hal -- storms already
moving in -- I cant see them and

winds are too strong to stay up
here -- over --
HAL (0S)

Rescue One -- abort Theyll be all
right Brett and Evan are dumb enough
not to log in but theyre smart
enough to have storm gear Head back

(not unkindly)
Maybe you can catch Gabe before he
leaves Over

MAGGIE
I dont think hes planning a long
visit Hal
(back to business)
Rescue One heading back to base over
and out

THE HELICOPTER

banks a 180 to fly back -- we can see over the horizon that
the storm is moving in fast

INT CAVE - DAY

We can hear Maggies helicopter flying off overhead -- camped
inside the cave are BRETT and EVAN both 20s both shivering
amid their gear -- backpacks cooking stuff -- and parachutes
These are Colorado rock jocks -- thrillseekers wholl try
anything if the odds are strong enough theyll die in the
process

EVAN
(freezing)
Way to check the weather Brett

BRETT
(shivering yet macho)
Hey If it were easy it wouldnt be
worth d-doing
CUT TO
EXT TREASURY JET (DC-9) - DAY

The DC-9 cruises over increasingly mountainous remote
terrain

INT JET - CLOSE ON TRAVERS

who looks tense -- we MOVE AROUND the cabin and find two more
relaxed Treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the
plane their arms chained to the currency cases Matheson is
edgy Another AGENT offers some condescending reassurance

AGENT
Just enjoy the view huh
(Matheson says nothing)
Relax I mean what could happen in
the air

Matheson turns back to his window and looks down --
WINDOW POV - THE GROUND BELOW

is covered with snow -- the jets shadow moves sleekly and
plainly over it But after a moment we see -- -- another
jets shadow on the ground coming up fast

INSIDE THE DC-9 - MATHESON
reacts this and shifts his look upward to --
WINDOW POV - ANOTHER PLANE (GULFSTREAM)

is flying a parallel course to the Treasury jet and is just
one hundred yards away Close enough to see Eric Qualens face
in one of the windows

INSIDE THE PLANE

Matheson stands -- Travers has noticed the plane by now too
and gets out of his seat as the other agents react

TRAVERS
(to other agents)
Stay put Dont panic goddammit

Travers moves into
THE COCKPIT
where the pilot seems nervous but oddly not frightened

PILOT
Hes coming in too slow

TRAVERS
(cool)
No -- were going too fast and were
too high up Push flaps forward twenty
degrees and drop to five thousand
feet
THE CABIN

Matheson is out of his seat pistol drawn Seems a little puny
under the circumstances

MATHESON
(to agent)
You got any rifles

AGENT
Forward compartment -- left side --

Matheson rushes through a curtain to the area between the
cabin and the cockpit and pulls open a closet door To his

horror he finds inside not rifles but

TWO DEAD BODIES

who well recognize as the missing FBI agents from the photos
Matheson showed Travers

MATHESON
backs up in horror -- and he sees Travers calmly coming out of
the cockpit Rattled Matheson pulls his gun on Travers
Travers looks dumbfounded -- then angry
TRAVERS
What the hell are you doing --
MATHESON
Checked the plane from top to bottom
huh You fucker --
(clicks hammer back)
Put your hands behind your head Its
over
Travers puts his hands out and walks forward -- slowly
backing Matheson into the cabin Not in surrender but as if

hes calming a nutcase The other agents see this and dont
know which way to jump

TRAVERS
Calm down -- give the gun to me --

MATHESON
(to other agents)
Theres a couple of dead bodies in the
front compartment -- theyre FBI
agents --

TRAVERS
Hes losing it --

They now think Matheson is crazy too -- he looks nuts -- the
other agents move behind him Matheson gets even more frantic
and point his gun at them

MATHESON
Goddamn it Dont you see what hes
doing Hes hijacking the fucking
shipment
(back to Travers)
Dont make me shoot you

The other two agents get behind Matheson and rapidly disarm
him Travers pulls out his gun with a slow leisurely move

TRAVERS
Dont make me laugh

Travers FIRES his gun three times one for each agents

chest -- the agents are cut down realizing too late whats
happened A fourth SHOT knocks Matheson over a seat as if hed
been kicked Travers puts his gun away and puts on a radio
headset as he goes to a window

TRAVERS

brushes some of the falling snow away from the marker He lays
down his flowers and pauses for a moment -- then gets into the

Gabe looks out the window at the countryside he used to belong
in Hes wondering if he still does
CUT TO
EXT TREASURY JETQUALENS JET - FLYING
Qualens jet is now flying parallel to and slightly above
the Treasury jet The door in Qualens jet is open and we get
our first good look at --
INTEXT QUALENS JET
-- Qualen who is also wearing a headset radio and is wired
to a safety line in the jet Hes lowering a thick steel cable
down to the Treasury jet
Qualen is as deadly as advertised -- 150 mph winds are tearing
at him through the open door but he is unfazed and
unfrightened
TRAVERS

is also wired to a safety line by his own jets open door

TRAVERS
(into radio)
More -- more -- keep it coming --
THE TWO PLANES
Qualens jet lowers the cable into the Treasury jet -- it
looks like an Air Force midair refuelling -- difficult and

dangerous After about thirty feet of line is lowered --
TRAVERS

-- takes it in and clips it to a ring at the top of the jets
doorway

TRAVERS
(into radio)
Locked on Move into lateral position

INSIDE QUALENS PLANE

The pilot KRISTEL is a woman Her skill like her hard
beauty can be measured in a glance shes a lot calmer than
her counterpart in the Treasury plane

KRISTEL
Moving into lateral position

ON THE TWO PLANES
Qualens jet lowers itself banking to the side -- the
Treasury jet raises itself Both are now flying side by side
with the cable serving as a thirty foot bridge

TREASURY JET CABIN

Travers unclipped from his safety line cautiously goes to
the cockpit The pilot nervous struggles with the controls

PILOT
Were right on the edge of the
storm -- lets move it

Travers pulls the two dead FBI agents out of the
compartment -- one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot
one in a suit like Travers

PILOT
This isnt going to work -- Wright
will suspect something

TRAVERS

So what Hell sift though a plane
that went down in a storm --

(gestures to bodies)
-- find enough pulverized bone for six
men heroically killed in the line of
duty --

(finds three suitcases)
-- and just enough of the right kind
of ash

Travers opens one of the cases which is identical to the
others -- except that its full of one dollar bills Hes
thought of everything

TRAVERS
We get twenty-one gun funerals and
they write off fifty million Its
perfect as long as you hold the plane
steady -- so concentrate

Travers moves back into the cabin
INSIDE QUALENS JET

We can now see four other passengers All are fit and armed --
HELDON and RYAN are seated while KYNETTE and DELMER ready to
help with the transfer are on the opposite side of the door
from a very impatient Qualen
QUALEN
(into radio)
Travers -- hurry it up

INSIDE TREASURY JET

Travers now in a harness like the one seen earlier -- uncuffs
the money cases from the agents

TRAVERS
(into radio)
On my way

Travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch
over and LED --

THE LED

starts counting down from 200 -- 159 -- 158 --

IN THE COCKPIT

Even in the last minute the storms gotten worse -- the plane

is flying right into the blackest center of it The pilot
looks more panicked than ever

TRAVERS
That charge is going to blow both
engines -- the planell go down like a

rock so clip yourself on to the end

of the cable with the money as soon as

I get over
(an afterthought)

And make sure you bring the right

cases

Travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the
cable between the planes

TRAVERS
(into the headset)
Dip the plane Im coming over

THE JETS - LONG SHOT

Qualens jet dips down so theres a sharp incline -- Travers
starts the slide down zipping in seconds across into

QUALENS JET

where hes pulled in and unclipped by Qualen
QUALEN
(shouting over the wind)
Why didnt you send the money over
TRAVERS
(shouting too)
Somehow I didnt think youd have
waited for me if Id sent it first
Qualen smiles in reply No Maybe he wouldnt
IN THE TREASURY PLANE COCKPIT
The pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin
THE LED
counts down -- 038 -- 037 -- 038 --
IN THE TREASURY PLANE CABIN

The pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach

them to the cable -- but as he steps past the bodies of --
THE AGENTS
Mathesons eyes open -- hes not dead yet

IN THE CABIN

The pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable
and is about to put his harness on -- but behind him Matheson
shakily crawls to his feet draws his gun and SHOOTS the
pilot in the back twice

THE PILOT

drops out of the plane flailing -- if hes screaming we
cant hear it over the HOWLING of the storm --

IN QUALENS JET
Qualen and Travers are watching the whole plan unravel --
TRAVERS
(shouting to cockpit)
Get underneath the jet The cases will
slide over

THE JETS - LONG SHOT

Qualens jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide
over -- but at the same time --
INSIDE THE TREASURY JET

Matheson groggy holds onto the doorway and FIRES a full clip

from his automatic at Qualens jet -- and
THE LED
counts down -- 002 -- 001 -- 000 -- and

THE TREASURY JETS ENGINES

THE JETS - LONG SHOT

As promised the Treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had
no wings at all levelling the angle between the planes -- the
cases dangle precariously on the wire --

INSIDE QUALENS JET

TRAVERS
(shouting)
Lower Get underneath it

INSIDE TREASURY JET

Matheson struggles to the cockpit and gets behind the controls
-- as if thats going to do any good --

THE JETS - LONG SHOT

Qualens jet is deliberately racing the disabled Treasury jet
down but its hopeless -- theres no way to get underneath
the falling jet long enough for the cases to slide over
INSIDE QUALENS JET - KRISTEL

isnt quite panicked Yet

KRISTEL
Its dragging us down Disconnect the
cable

INT QUALENS JET - CABIN

Heldon and Ryan try to do just that but the cable is
taut -- theres no way to loosen the clip on the door --

BOTH JETS
dive down faster at an ever steeper angle over the edge of
the Colorado mountain range --

INSIDE THE TREASURY JET
-- the clip on the door finally breaks --
BOTH JETS - LONG SHOT

-- the Treasury jet drops as Qualens jet trailing the cable
and the money sharply shoots upward --

THE TREASURY JET

makes a one point landing nose first into the wilderness
cartwheeling into a FIREBALL

INT EXT RANGER STATION

The sound of the EXPLOSION muffled in the wind far-off but
audible drives Hal outside -- hes alert but cant see
anything in the murk of the storm --

INT QUALENS JET - THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL

levels off the plane but its still in trouble --

CABIN - QUALEN AND TRAVERS

struggle to reel in the cable because --

CLOSE ON THE CABLE

The money cases are still barely holding on the cuffs
caught on the broken clip at the end --

QUALEN AND TRAVERS

arent even bothering with the electric winch theyre
dragging it in hand over hand -- but --

CLOSE ON THE CABLE

-- the cases torn by the wind work their way loose one at a
time and drop -- one -- two -- three -- into the snowy
mountains below

IN THE CABIN

Heldon and Ryan clamp the door shut as Qualen angrily attacks
Travers --
THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL

tries to bring the plane up but cant -- the fuel guage
needle is dropping fast --

INSERT - THE WING

is pouring out fuel through a dozen bullet holes -- one of two
engines sputters to a stop

THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL POV

The plane is now just skirting the mountain tops and is still
being battered by storm winds -- Kristel aims it for what
looks like the flattest longest mountain top --

THE CABIN

Kynette and Ryan grab Qualen and Travers to separate them --
all strap in because

THE PLANE

is going down -- it just tops the edge of a precipice and hits
the ground level --

THE MOUNTAIN TOP - LONG SHOT

-- the problem is the ground itself isnt level it tilts
down towards another edge five hundred yards distant -- if the
plane keeps skidding itll go over the edge --

THE PLANE

sleds down at an angle skipping over rocks -- -- through
trees --

-- tearing off a wing --
THE COCKPIT

Kristel rides the stick only out of habit -- nothing she does
is going to matter now --

INSIDE THE CABIN

The men are jolted around -- windows IMPLODE as Kynette tries
to protect a bag of what is obviously explosives --

THE PLANE
rips downhill through a wooded area like a runaway train --
-- the second wing is sheared off by trees --

COCKPIT POV - THE OPPOSITE EDGE

is coming up fast -- but

THE PLANE

wrenches to a sudden halt the fuselage intact

WIDER VIEW - THE PLANE

or whats left of it has stopped several feet short of the
edge -- we can see why the steel cable trailing from the
cargo door has lashed itself around a half dozen trees
acting as a tripwire to stop the plane

INSIDE THE PLANE

Quiet All are dazed but outside of superficial cuts
unhurt Kristel moves out of the cockpit looking around

KRISTEL
So much for phase one
(to Travers)
Now what

She speaks for all of them -- especially a still-seething
Qualen Travers pulls out the tracer monitor for the cases
The tracer screen shows three distinct blips -- the tracers
have survived the fall

TRAVERS
Now -- we call the police

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

The Bronco wends through a winding country road coming
finally to a cabin settled in a clearing

GABE
pulls into the driveway and puts the Bronco in park He
doesnt cut the engine because hes not sure whether hes

going in or not Finally -- he cuts the ignition

INT CABIN - DAY

A knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside Gabe
opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside
GABE
Maggie

No answer Gabe takes a look around the living room His face
tells us without a doubt this used to be his home Gabe
moves inside pausing at a mantle Two framed photos -- Gabe
and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock bolted to a sheer
wall over a 2000 foot drop Gabe Hal and Maggie all
younger all sporting drunken grins in a mountain cave Gabe
smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a BANGING at
the back of the cabin shakes him out of it

EXT CABIN - DAY - THE BACK DOOR
has come open and swings in the wind Gabe steps outside and
pulls it shut Gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a

small but sturdy shed a few yards away Gabe heads over to it

INT SHED - DAY
Not a storage shed at all -- its a small workspace that
offers solid protection from the elements is well-lit and
whistle-clean Maggie in front of a table pulls a cover off

A LARGE PLASTIC CAGE

-- inside is a bald eagle One of maybe 2000 left in the
country Its uneven feathering and small gawky size tells us
it isnt nearly full grown A bandage on its side tells us
its been injured Maggies smile tells us its healing

MAGGIE
Hey there --

The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in and shuts the
door behind him Maggie looks surprised to see him Gabe just
looks awkward

GABE
Hi
(beat)
Could you introduce us

MAGGIE
Sure Gabe Walker -- this is A27
A27 -- Gabe

GABE
Not the tag -- what do you call
him

MAGGIE

Her I call her Lucky

GABE
(bends down eyes wound)
Poachers
(Maggie nods)
Bastards

MAGGIE
They got the mother -- and left this
one behind Too small to make a decent
trophy I guess

GABE
About four months right
(Maggie nods)
Christ -- it must have been just about
his -- I mean her -- first flight --

MAGGIE
Time to change the dressing
Maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves

GABE
You cant do that alone --

MAGGIE
Ive had to learn She trust me --

Maggie reaches into the cage but the eagle starts thrashing

GABE

Im making her nervous --

(beat)

You hold her Ill do the dressing

Gabe finds another pair of gloves sterile cotton pads and
alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagles
beak and talons quickly but gently and takes it out of the
cage holding it firm This is clearly something theyve done
many times before They move together tight -- Gabe and
Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage
the eagle Its getting warmer in here Gabe reaches down and
yanks off the patch The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the
wound

GABE
Got some fight in her -- thats good
(beat)
What happened to Dave

MAGGIE
The usual Flew off -- never calls
never writes --

Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch
and sticks it on the eagles side Maggie puts the eagle back
in the cage and closes the top door Gabe and Maggie dont
move any further apart as they pull their gloves off Gabe
tentatively reaches for Maggies face -- but she pushes him
hand away

MAGGIE
Im glad to see you Gabe But I kind
of wish you hadnt come I was almost
used to you being gone
(beat quiet)
Why are you here

GABE
(pauses)
Standing in the sheds doorway is Hal

OUTSIDE SHED

I thought I came back to see if Id
learned to live with it Well big
surprise Coming back just tore me
open all over again like it all
happened yesterday instead of a year
ago Nothings changed Including the
way I feel about you

(beat)
I didnt realize it till I saw you at
the airport But I came back for you
Maggie

MAGGIE
Does that mean youre going to stay

GABE
No Not here
(beat)
I want you come with me Start over
somewhere else

MAGGIE

(incredulous)
You come back after being gone a year
and you expect me to --

(beat)
You dont live here any more Gabe
Your choice remember But this is
my home Im not leaving You can
stay with me or you can go alone
Its still your choice

HAL (0S)
Now theres an easy call

Furious Gabe heads out after Hal

GABE
What the hell do you want

HAL
(beat)
I need your help A planes gone down
on Comb Bluff This storm would blow
a copter all over the place -- but we
can climb up to it

GABE

Stone faced Grim
We
(beat)

Talk to somebody whos still on the

payroll Youve got a half dozen new

guys

HAL
-- who couldnt climb that wall now if
there were stairs cut into it But
youve soloed it

GABE
During the summer On a bet

HAL
This is a little more important than a
bet Just a few injured people with
no first aid or shelter camping in a
zero degree blizzard Theyll be ice
sculptures by tomorrow morning

GABE
(shakes his head)
Maybe you missed the headlines -- but

I dont do rescues any more Theyre
bad for my conscience

(beat)
Fuck this one up on your own

Gabe walks past Hal Furious Hal spins Gabe around

HAL
Play it again Gabe about how we
killed her I was there too remember

GABE
(hot)
Not like I was pal -- her fingers
brushed mine on the way down --

HAL

(right back)
-- and I was the one who had to deal
with her family when you fucking tore
out of town

(takes a breath)
We lost her Whatever anybody says
about cold stress and the clip you
and I have to live with that But
right now there are some more people
who need our help and they shouldnt
die too just because youve got a
problem keeping the past in the past
Gabe knows hes right But hes hesitant And scared

GABE
I dont want the responsibility

HAL

Walk away and you are responsible
Theyll die I cant do this alone

(Gabe slows but doesnt

stop)
You know what else Gabe You can go
anywhere you want but if you dont do
this now youre going to be stuck on
that goddamn ledge for the rest of
your life

Gabe turns Sees Maggie in the doorway Shes heard every
word Gabe turns to Hal -- hesitates -- and nods

EXT COMB BLUFF TRAILHEAD - WIDE SHOT - DAY

Relative to the other mountains Comb Bluff is smaller --
about 2500 feet high But thats like saying the Empire State
Building is smaller than the Sears Tower Its still a long
way up if youre climbing the stairs

ON THE GROUND - GABE AND HAL

with full packs of mountaineering gear on Theyve got to

climb up this beast Gabe -- now back in his orange Sheriffs
jacket -- scrambles with Hal up the base of the mountain the
last few yards before it turns into a sloping wall Gabe
takes a bolt gun -- which fires rope-fastened bolts into
rock -- and hangs it from a strap on his chest

HAL

(indicating gun)
That things dead weight Completely
useless for an ice climb

GABE
Just backup

Gabe readies a coil of rope and starts up the wall

GABE
(not a challenge)
Ill lead I left a few bolts last
time I climbed this -- I think I can
find some of them
Hal starts up after Gabe easily keeping pace with him

HAL
Save the rope for when it gets tough
(beat realizing)
That bet was for you to free climb

the wall
GABE
(further up)
Tell you what Hal -- if were still

alive tomorrow morning Ill give you
the twenty bucks back okay

COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT

Two orange specks move their way up the mountain -- its
definitely going to be a long trip

DISSOLVE

EXT COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT - DAY - GABE AND HAL
are now visibly two-thirds of the way up
CLOSER ON GABE AND HAL - THE MOUNTAIN FACE

is not only higher its a lot tougher to climb Instead of

being angular the wall is now completely vertical -- and
coated with ice Rough irregular ice ledges are all Gabe and
Hal can grip -- its a matter of grabbing what you can for a

handhold and kicking the spikes of the steel crampons on
their boots into the ice for footholds Gabe leads planting
pitons into the ice threading the rope through them as he
goes Three steel pins between Gabe and Hal Their only safety
net Gabe trailing rope behind him goes up a difficult slab
of ice and climbs under a ledge where he anchors the rope in
the ice with another piton

GABE
(shouting down)
Anchored

HAL

is beside and slightly below Gabe -- at the other end of the
fifty foot rope Hal cautiously pulls himself along the line
to the first piton -- as is standard for a climb he pulls out
the piton then moves on to the second -- but up above
HIGHER ON THE MOUNTAIN

Ice building in a small crevase builds and CRACKS the
adjoining rock -- several ten-pound boulders fall causing a
chain reaction

ROCKSLIDE

that bounces down the wall --

GABE

hugs the ice wall making himself as flat as possible --

GABE
(shouting down)
Rockslide
HAL
flattens too as rocks bounce past -- the second anchoring

piton LOOSENS as it is struck by a falling rock -- Hal
nervously eyes the last piton between him and Gabe --

THE PITON - CLOSE

also has been clipped by the still falling boulders and droops
at half mast -- no way are these going to hold in the
unreliable ice --

HAL

tries to stay flat but one boulder painfully CLIPS him on the
shoulder knocking him from his perch -- Hal falls --

WIDER - HAL FALLING

In falling Hals weight on the rope yanks out the nearest
anchor piton -- Hal tumbles in space keeping pace with the
boulders as --

GABE

whos seen everything we have quickly reaches to the piton
hes just anchored and removes the carabiner clip --

HAL - FALLING

The rope draws taut yanking out the last piton between he and
Gabe -- nothing but a few yards of slack rope now --

GABE
has the bolt gun out He rapidly hooks the ropes carabiner
clip to the chambered bolt and FIRES it at a solid rock ledge
above him --

INSERT - THE BOLT

imbeds solidly in the rock --

GABE

lashes the rope to his shoulder bracing for the coming impact
by lodging his feet in the ice --

THE JOLT - WIDER SHOT

The line pulls taut leaving Hal suspended the wind knocked
out of him from the impact --

GABE

is almost dragged down by the jolt -- he painfully takes most
of the impact in his shoulders -- the shock forces his feet
through an ice ledge -- but the rope bolted to the rock

above has held Barely

GABE
(shaken voice gone)
Anchored --
(shouts this time)
Anchored

HAL

now somewhat recovered steadies himself

HAL
(breathless too)
Youre sure this time --

Hal climbs up the rope finally reaching another ledge
slightly below Gabes Hal leans against the wall gasping as
Gabe clips the gun to his pack

HAL
(looking up at gun)
Dont say it --

GABE
(wheezing too)
Its kind of hard to resist --

that only comes from just missing a violent end

LAUGHTER is nearly louder than the wind as we --

DISSOLVE

EXT PRECIPICE EDGE - DAY - BINOCULAR POV

From the top of the bluff someone is looking down through
binoculars -- Gabe and Hals orange jackets are plainly
visible a few hundred yards below

RYAN

lowers the binoculars and keys an ear button on the headset
radio hes wearing sending a beep

INSIDE THE PLANE

Travers is wearing another headset -- the others are just
resting in the seats

TRAVERS
(into mouthpiece)
Have they arrived
(two beeps in response)
Good Return to the plane and cover
your tracks

QUALEN
(to others)
Get ready

ON THE MOUNTAIN BELOW

Hal and Gabe are tired but get a second wind from the
excitement of being almost on top Gabe stops breathless for
a second then goes on Hal lags a little behind

GABE
Come on -- the hard parts over
Gabe heads up and over
THE MOUNTAINS EDGECRASH SITE

and helps Hal up From here the rest of the range looms
large Even in the continuing snowstorm its a spectacular
sight -- but Gabe and Hal dont pause to enjoy it This isnt
a trip for sport Hal looks off into the trees and sees the
torn tree stumps from the plane crash

HAL
(grim)
Thats it

Hal and Gabe run into the wooded area and follow the
wreckage -- felled trees a smashed wing -- and reach

THE FUSELAGE
which sits intact by the other edge of the precipice

GABE
I thought the fuselage was broken
That looks pretty cozy

HAL
(puzzled too)
The pilot was hysterical

GABE
Somethings wrong here --
HAL
Does this look like a prank to you
Come on --
Hal pulls open the passenger door and goes in -- Gabe wary
takes a look around the plane
INSIDE THE FUSELAGE
Its comparatively dark in here -- Hal starts in shining a

light -- the beam finds

HALS POV - TRAVERS

slumped down on the cabin floor a blanket wrapped around
him -- hes shaking and is generally giving a good impression

of a shock victim Hal rushes to him

HAL
Relax -- were here to help --
Weak Travers whispers as Hal gives him some water

HAL
Dont try to talk --
Travers wont quit -- Hal leans down to hear
TRAVERS
(hoarse whisper)

HAL

-- Where What are you --

A gun barrel moves INTO VIEW as it presses against Hals neck
Heldon and Ryan are right behind him Travers instantly drops
his act

TRAVERS

Where are the rest

You said we

GABE - OUTSIDE THE FUSELAGE

notes footprints in the snow -- fresh ones -- and kneels down
to look at the cable wrapped around the tree No ordinary
accident But before he can think about this he gets an
earful of gun barrel from Qualen who is behind him

INSIDE THE FUSELAGE

Qualen hustles Gabe inside the plane -- his hands are on his
head and his pack has been removed Qualen throws the pack
to Ryan and Delmer who rifle through it removing anything
that could be a weapon -- they quickly confiscate Gabes bolt
gun and ice axe

TRAVERS

Travers motions to Ryan and Qualen who shove Gabe and Hal
forward in the cabin Travers takes out the tracer monitor

TRAVERS

(showing them the blips)
See these Now Ive bet the gentlemen
behind you that you know enough about
this mountain range to lead us to each
of these quickly and that youd be
happy to do so They bet me you
couldnt and wouldnt

(guns are clicked)

Now tell me -- who wins
Gabe and Hal eye each other -- no choice Gabe nods
TRAVERS

Good dog Now lets get this
expedition started

EXT FACING MOUNTAIN - WIDE SHOT

Hal and Gabe lead the expedition down a steep but passable
descent leading to --

A NATURAL STONE BRIDGE

that links Comb Bluff with the next mountain Travers stops
Gabe and pulls out the monitor

TRAVERS
Okay Connect the dots
TO

Gabe pauses as he holds the monitor up against the
mountainscape

MOUNTAIN AND MONITOR

The first blip is up a thousand feet -- its a wall and
obviously not something for a novice Gabe pauses a little
too long -- Qualen nudges him with his gun Gabe hands the

monitor back to Travers

GABE
This way

Gabe with Hal right behind leads them up the wall -- its
not a straight climb but theres a series of zig-zagging
natural ledges that cut up the wall Wide enough even for an
amateur The others follow Gabe and Hals example

DISSOLVE

EXT MOUNTAIN WALL - WIDE SHOT - DAY - HAL AND GABE

have led the gang further up the wall using pitons and
carabiner clips to create a guide rope Its still just a
matter of climbing relatively easy ascending ledges Hal and
Gabe lead them by jumping to the next ledge

CLOSER ON HAL AND GABE
As Gabe hammers in a new piton he turns to Hal

GABE
(sotto)
We dont have to do this We know
these mountains -- they dont If we
can get ahead --

HAL
Can you climb faster than they can
shoot

GABE
Weve got to try something Think
well get a finders fee after they
get all their luggage

HAL
Sure All the bullets we can eat

GABE
Thats not what really worries me
HAL
Theres something else to worry

about

GABE
Yeah Once theyve got what theyre
after -- theyre gonna need a copter

to get out of here

HAL
(realizing)
Maggie

Gabe nods grimly -- and keeps moving up The rest keep pace

THE WALL

The climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on
the wall -- the ledge is now two feet wide Travers takes out
the tracer monitor -- the monitor shows that the first case is
just above them

TRAVERS
Hold it
(beat)
Its up there

UP THERE - AN OVERHANG

juts out of the wall fifty feet above their position As the
rest of the wall above is completely sheer its obvious that
the case if it is above has landed on top of a ledge

But this isnt easily accessible -- we MOVE DOWN from the
overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds
to get up there and those are slick with ice and snow Worse
the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve making
climbing almost impossible

ON THE LEDGE
Travers holds his gun on Gabe and motions up

TRAVERS
Fetch

GABE
Ill need the ice axe

TRAVERS
(laughs)
Youve got to be kidding

GABE
(sighs)
Okay How about some tape

Travers nods -- Kynette pulls a roll of tape out of Gabes
confiscated pack and throws it to him
GABE

Crampons too

Travers hesitates but nods -- Kynette throws him the iron
spikes Gabe fastens them to his boots

Gabe looks up -- this is going to be tough even for him In
spite of the cold he takes off his gloves -- thats how small
these holds are -- and he meticulously tapes up his hands and

his fingers
HIGH ANGLE - GABE

moves up the wall with some ease at first -- there are
hand-sized handholds and decent footholds -- but twenty feet
up theres nothing To keep going Gabe has to painfully
wedge his fingers into small cracks essentially supporting
his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment
We can see from the angle that Gabe is at least 3000 feet
from solid ground We can see from his face that hes trying
not to think about it

ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN

watch Gabes slow progress

QUALEN
I dont trust him

TRAVERS
(indicating wall)
Where could he go

QUALEN
Id rather he didnt show us
(beat)
We dont need two guides

TRAVERS
(shrugs)
You win Kill him when he gets down
GABE ON THE WALL - CLOSE

Make that if he comes down Gabe is now in one of the

worst positions possible for a free climb He is moving up

the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging
upside down knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support
Its excruciating -- both in terms of muscular effort and the
abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock
again and again Gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides
the other up hammering it into a crack wedge with ice --

some of the ice chips whistle past and down --

-- finally Gabe gropes one hand over the edge and pulls
himself onto

THE OVERHANG

Exhausted Gabe pulls himself prone across the top Something
hard is underneath him -- Gabe recovers and brushes the snow
off the money case thats underneath Its battered from the
fall but is still barely holding together Gabe manages to
force open the trashed locks -- he looks inside the case and
fingers a band of 5000s

GABE
Jesus

ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN

look up They can see Gabe has made it -- but they cant see
him or the case

TRAVERS
(impatient shouting)
Lower it down -- now
ON THE OVERHANG - GAB
has no intention of doing this -- he snaps the case shut and
looks over at a ledge that moves off from it -- and at the ice

and snow above
ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALENS POV
try to look up and locate Gabe They cant Until --
GABE (0S)
(shouting down)
Ive got a better idea Why dont you

come up and get it

With the case Gabe moves back against the wall on a ledge
that skirts off the overhand -- from Travers and Qualens
point of view Gabe can hardly be seen -- since the mountain
bulges out as it goes up Gabes got a slight edge of cover

TRAVERS
(shouts to Heldon)
Get him

Heldon runs along the lower ledge FIRING up at --

GABE

who has to flatten against the upper ledge -- bullets howl
past at twenty per second SPARKING against the lip of the
rock -- its cover but not much --

HAL

looks up worried --
HALS POV - ICE AND SNOW

piled by the ton from the storm lie further above -- the ice
holding it back already already weakened by the sun is being
chiselled away by bullets --

ON THE LOWER LEDGE - QUALEN
grabs Hal and puts the gun to his head

QUALEN
(shouting)
Bring the money down or we kill your
friend

Travers pushes the barrel away from Hal shaking his head

TRAVERS
We cant
(frowning)
And he knows it

WIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN - THE PARALLEL LEDGES

Gabe moves across his thing ledge as Heldon runs across his --
Gabe ducks back and has to flatten even more against the wall
because his ledge is getting smaller --

HELDON

smiles seeing Gabes cover is gone -- Heldons ledge is
getting wider so its easier for him to fire up Heldon moves
out to the edge --

GABES POV DOWN

Theres now nothing between Heldon and Gabe -- Heldon takes
dead aim --
GABE

looks up sweating it --

GABE
Come on --

THE ICE AND SNOW

above finally give way dropping an avalanche on

GABE

who drops the case and hugs the wall --

THE AVALANCHE - WIDE VIEW ON MOUNTAIN

Only now can we see how much snow and ice had been penned up
on the mountain top -- tons of ice and snow sweep down the
mountainside -- it SHATTERS the case against the wall as it
easily swipes a SCREAMING Heldon off the ledge --

TRAVERS QUALEN AND HAL

are safe at their vantage but stunned at the sight of --
THE AVALANCHE

Heldons machine fun FIRES uselessly as hes swallowed in an
explosion of white -- as well as a flurry of green as the

bills scatter amid the snow --

-- then quiet The avalanche ends as abruptly as it started
The rumble dies down to complete silence

TRAVERS

apoplectic stares at seventeen million dollars worth of snow
settling far below He takes his gun furious and fires at

THE UPPER LEDGE
where Gabe was hugging the wall -- its now blanketed with

snow Travers FIRES an entire clip at where Gabe used to be
The snow FALLS AWAY revealing nothing but stark rock Gabe
has been swept away

HAL

reacts and attacks Travers

HAL
You son of a bitch --

Travers turns and pins Hal against the wall with the gun
ready to kill him too But hes stopped by Qualen

QUALEN
No We need him to get the rest of the
money
(he isnt backing down)
If he dies we lose everything

Travers furious takes the gun out of Hals face
TRAVERS
(to Hal)

Get us out of here

Hal stares at Travers with absolute fury -- but he leads the
gang back along the ledge in retreat

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

Powdery snow is settling from the avalanche From a cave in
the rocks Brett and Evan crawl out a little timidly

EVAN
What the hell --

Evan takes a pair of overpriced binoculars and looks up --
BINOCULAR POV - FAR UP ON LEDGE

The figures are small but its clear that one is pointing a
gun at an orange-jacketed figure

EVAN

lowers the binoculars

EVAN
Brett -- youre not going to believe
this -- but a couple of guys are

holding a gun on Hal and forcing him
up the bluff --
BRETT (0S)
I believe it

Evan turns to

BRETT

who has found both Heldons broken body and his gun half
buried in snow Evan walks over amazed

EVAN
What the fuck is going on here

Brett picks up the gun -- this is more an adventure than he
ever dreamed of

BRETT
Lets catch up and find out

Brett and Evan grab their packs and hurry onto a trail as we
return to --

THE UPPER LEDGE

where Gabe was Nothing is stirring Until theres some
movement ten feet from where Gabe was hugging the wall

Hal takes the monitor -- the next blip is above almost
straight up Hal motions to the wooded area ahead

HAL
The next ones on top of the peak
Thisll be long but easy -- more like

a hike than a climb

TRAVERS
(suspicious)
It looks like a winding route

HAL
Theres a more direct route The East

try it in a snowstorm

Envision a wall A really big wall A really really big wall
A wall thats as wide as it is high -- five thousand feet by
five thousand feet -- narrowing to a domed peak at the summit

Now picture the same wall checkered with ice If this were
horizontal you or I couldnt walk on it without falling

Now picture the same wall with an orange dot two-thirds of
the way up it The orange dot is

GABE

and he barely has the strength to hold on much less go up
Gabe holds himself steady with one hand gets a foothold and
swings another hand up to SLAM it against the wall

Hes improvised gear -- hes tied a crampon to one hand But
its as awkward as it sounds Gabe moves up only a foot or so
-- then pulls out the crampon reaches up and SLAMS it into
the wall starting the painful process over again

WIDER ON MOUNTAIN

Gabe finally reaches the top of the wall where it meets an
enormous overhang of ice

GABE

is right underneath where the ice flows over the wall Gabe
takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice
overhead with more force than usual This one is going to have
to hold

Gabe steels himself for a tough move -- with one hand gripping
that crampon he swings out away from the wall

Only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand
are keeping Gabe from falling Gabe needs the second crampon
to make the move up -- but thats not going to be easy to get
Its attached to his boot

As Gabe clings to the upper crampon his body swaying he
reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon

GABES POV - DOWN

The ground is one slip and five thousand feet away Gabe
fumbles desperately with the buckles on the crampons -- but
both his fingers and the buckles are frozen stiff --

GABES FACE
shows real solid terror for the first time --
GABES POV - DOWN

Gabe gets the first buckle off -- then the second The crampon
is off his boot

GABE

still swinging from one hand takes the now-freed crampon and
slams it into the ice It doesnt hold -- but the force of
Gabes swing pushing him away has loosened the other
crampon Gabe only gets one more shot at this -- he swings
the free crampon up with all his might -- it catches in the
same split second as the other dislodges

But the hard part is over -- with the two crayons Gabe
quickly manages to climb up over the lip of
THE ICE OVERHANG

This is a field of ice sloping up to the top Gabe pulls
himself a few feet away from the edge and puts the crampons
back on his feet where they belong Its now pretty simple for
Gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to

THE SUMMIT

which is a rocky wooded area Gabe seems to have a second

wind now -- he runs to the other side of the summit The other
side is obviously the route Hal and the others will be
taking -- beneath the summit is a winding well-beaten path

Gabe finally arrives at a small shack with a sign nearby
commemorating the DOUGLAS EXPEDITION - 1933

INT THE SHACK

is just a small point of interest shed for hardy tourists
who have hiked up this far -- there is a corny photo stand
where you stick your head through a hole so your face is put
on top of a cartoon climber hacking up a mountain Gabe rushes
past this to a glass display case on the wall

THE GORDON DOUGLAS DISPLAY

has black and white photos of a square jawed 1930s climber

with his expedition -- more important is whats beneath it
Douglas original climbing equipment -- a coil of rope some
pitons a hat a cloth backpack small binoculars other odds
and ends Gabe prepares to smash the glass -- and hesitates
Respect
GABE
(sighing)
Sorry Gordon -- I promise Ill have

it back tomorrow
Gabe SMASHES the glass as we move to --
EXT THE TRAIL - DAY

Hal is leading Qualen Travers and the others upward -- this
is a comparatively easy route but still tiring The sun goes
down beyond a facing taller mountain Ryan is huffing and
puffing -- the altitude and exertion are getting to him Hal
allows himself a smile at his discomfort

HAL
Come on -- tourists take this trail

Qualen pokes Hal with the gun -- he moves on ahead
EXT THE SUMMIT - DUSK

Its getting dark rapidly -- Gabe has scaled a rock formation
so he has a view of the rest of the summit --

GABES POV - SCANNING THE TREELINE

Gabe slowly looks along the trees of the summit -- looks
pretty ordinary to us but something must have caught Gabes
eye because he swings back to look at one tree With broken
branches on top

GABE
climbs down from his rock perch and rushes toward the tree
EXT SUMMIT TRAIL - NIGHT

This expedition reaches the top -- Hal is in the lead with
Qualen just inches behind Qualen shoves Hal forward

TRAVERS
Is this it

HAL
Yeah This is it

TRAVERS

Good Get out of the way
Travers takes out the tracer and starts following the blip
ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE

frantically rushes around looking for the case -- he spots a
crater of snow rushes to it and starts digging Even below
the snow the tracers blinking red light is glowing and
visible Gabe laughs as he digs it out

NEARBY ON THE SUMMIT - TRAVERS

has his eyes glued to the tracer monitor which shows the case
is nearby

TRAVERS
(smiling)
This way

Qualen shines a light -- all of them push their way through
the trees
TRAVERS

is excited now -- he cant even wait for Qualens flashlight
he intuitively races through the trees dividing his attention
between his surroundings and

THE MONITOR

which shows hes practically on top of the case -- finally
TRAVERS
shoves his way through some small pines -- he can see the

blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches

TRAVERS
(calling behind)
Its over here

Travers shoves his way through the branches and heads for the
light -- but somethings wrong -- Qualen comes up behind
Travers and shines the light on

A SNOWMAN

cute if hastily constructed stands with a five-pebble smile
as well as Douglas cap in a clearing The still blinking
still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman The case
is leaned up against it

Travers runs over to the case furious and opens it Its

empty -- except for a single 5000 bill Travers picks it
up -- scrawled on the margin is LETS TRADE
TRAVERS
(incredulous)
Hes still alive
(furious)

Hes still alive
(to Qualen and the
others)
He cant be far away -- spread out

Qualen Kynette Delmer and Krystel fan out into the woods
each with a flashlight and a fun Ryan however straps on
nightfinder goggles and runs out without a flashlight

TRAVERS
(to Hal brandishing gun)
Put your hands on your head

ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE
watches the chaos with a grin from a slightly elevated vantage
point -- he can see the flashlight beams all headed in the
wrong direction But he doesnt see

RYAN - NIGHTFINDER POV

With these goggles light is amplified a thousandfold -- this

isnt one of those infra-red thermo-blob jobs -- it looks
more like day for night photography Even starlight is enough
for Ryan to run easily through the thick woods -- and hes

going in the right direction
GABE

begins climbing down to level ground so he can circle closer
to where Travers is holding Hal -- before he can get far --

NIGHTFINDER POV - RYAN

looks up and can clearly see Gabe climbing down the small
rock twenty yards distant --

RYAN

smiles looking macabre under the goggles and opens fire --

GABE

is startled as the bullets impact inches over his head -- he
jumps the last ten feet to the ground and is running even as
he hits the ground -- more bullets hit where Gabe was a

split second ago --
RYAN

chases Gabe easily maneuvering through the trees --

GABE
runs too trying to dodge Ryans continuing fusillades -- Gabe
knows this territory but to him its still pitch dark -- he

stumbles and rams against trees --

RYAN

keeps coming up behind closing the hap Gabes bright form
just ahead --

GABE

comes out of the trees and finds he is on another part of the
summit All thats beneath him is
GABES POV
-- a sudden sloping plunge down a field of ice No escape

route here -- anything that goes down this slide is going all
the way to the ground far below

GABE
is driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets -- he dives to
the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder -- the

sole source of cover
ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT

Kristel Qualen and Kynette having heard the gunshots are
now rushing to Gabes position --

RYAN

almost casually emerges from the woods He can see there is
nowhere for Gabe to have gone -- except behind the boulder He
walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world

GABE

fumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the
Douglas exhibit -- an ancient flare that looks like a can of
sterno Gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it -- it
resists and looks like a dud but finally it catches and as
it ignites Gabe heaves it over the boulder at Ryan --

RYAN - NIGHTFINDER POV - THE FLARE

arcs over the boulder to fully ignite turning everything
into a blinding agonizing flash of white --

RYAN

SCREAMS putting one hand over the goggles trying to rip them
off --

GABE
bolts out from behind the boulder to rush him --
RYAN

instantly aware of what Gabes doing blindly shoots fanning
out in a semi-circle as he gets the goggles off --
GABE

just runs straight ahead to Ryan getting to him before the
machine gun field of fire can intersect his path -- Gabe
tackles Ryan as he manages to get the goggles off -- both men
fall to the ground and --

The machine gun CLATTERS away landing on the edge of the ice
just out of reach -- Ryan now recovered from the blinding
flash pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at
Gabe -- Gabe rolls away in time and gets to the machine gun
grabbing it -- But Ryan dives for Gabe slamming into him --
the force of it knocks the machine gun loose -- it skips down
the ice slope -- but the momentum of Ryans hit also carries
both Gabe and Ryan over the edge onto --

THE ICE SLOPE

Gabe and Ryan both tumble over the edge and start sliding
down Ryan face first on his stomach Gabe head first and on
his back -- both are in immediate agony because

CLOSE ON THE ICE

-- its covered with razor sharp irregular ridges both large
and small that slice through clothing and shred skin as they
pick up speed --

GABES UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE ICE FIELD

The edge and a five thousand foot drop are less than a hundred
yards away --

GABE AND RYAN SLIDING

Ryan flails and SCREAMS as the ice gashes him from

underneath -- Gabe however manages to flip over and to the
side -- he lunges on top of Ryan and rides him down like a
bobsled --

GABES POV - END OF THE ICE SLOPS
is coming up too fast --
GABE

tries to maintain his perch on Ryan who is SCREAMING and not
yet used to the idea of being a human sled -- he isnt
remaining still enough to provide a smooth ride -- Gabe
frantically reaches behind to Ryans wrist to get the ice axe
trailing from a wrist strap but Ryans arm is thrashing away
threatening to toss off the axe --
ON SUMMIT

Qualen Kristel and Kynette arrive at the lip and look down
incredulous --

QUALEN POV - GABE RIDING RYAN
Gabe and Ryan accelerating have almost reached the edge --
GABE

finally grabs the ice axe pulling it off Ryans wrist -- just
as they reach the precipice edge Gabe loops the axe to his
wrist and swings toward the ice with everything hes got --

The axes scythe-like blade catches on the ice right at the
lip of the precipice -- Gabe is wrenched to a painful halt
suspended over the drop as whats left of Ryan still
SCREAMING shoots over the edge --

Gabe unhooks the axe and gets another handhold Gabe uses the
axe to climb further down the ice to some rock -- finding

easier hand holds he quickly disappears into the darkness

QUALEN KRISTEL AND KYNETTE

look down -- Ryans death scream is still echoing Qualen is
furious -- Gabe has escaped with the second case
QUALEN
(to Kynette)

Follow him

Kynette shines his flashlight below illuminating the long
frozen streak of blood on the ice

KYNETTE
(gestures with light)
After you

INT DOUGLAS TOURIST SHACK - NIGHT

The expedition has holed up here for the night -- Travers and
Qualen look upset Things arent going as well as theyd
hoped Kristel tries to get some candy out of a vending
machine thats obviously empty Kynette saws at some camp food
with a distinctive knife -- the handle is a set of brass
knuckles Delmer guards Hal who is bound and seated by the
souvenir photo stand
Well -- look at the bright side
(beat)

At least youve only got to make the

split five ways now

EXT MOUNTAIN LEDGE - NIGHT

Gabe confidently drops down onto a large ledge that juts out

from the wall -- obviously familiar territory for him The
ledge leads to a small enclosed cave Gabe takes out his
penlight and shines it -- but the light looks dim Batteries

are low Gabe pockets it flicks his lighter and goes in --
THE CAVE

in the flickering light we can see that no one has been in
here for a while -- snow dust rocks -- but we should also
recognize this from the photo seen earlier as Gabe Maggie and
Hals hangout

GABE

smiles with the memories -- then his face brightens with one
memory in particular Gabe rushes to a corner of the cave and
opens a rock-lid to a hiding place

GABE
Please still be there -- oh
please --

Gabe reaches in the stash and finds an ancient half-full pint
of Jack Daniels The first thing to go right all day Gabe
uncaps it and gratefully gulps down a double shot Peace at
last Gabe smiles and leans against the wall closing his eyes
-- but hes startled instantly by a SCREECH -- Gabes eyes
shoot open --

An aggressive rat scurries toward him on the floor

Gabe grabs a rock and CLOBBERS the rat off-screen ending the
screeches with one blow Gabes face first registers

disgust -- then an idea Then real disgust Sighing Gabe
pulls out a pocket knife and opens the blade

CUT TO
INT THE CAVE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON GABE
Gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass -- properly skinned and
butchered -- off his knife blade We can see from flickering

shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave -- we
pull back to see
THE FIRE

which is built out of small bundles of 5000 bills Its safe
to say that something like 500000 is going up in smoke and
the fires dying down Gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on
the flame Gabe cools the knife in some snow saws off a rat
leg and chews unhappily

GABE
(mouth full)
Mmm Just like -- chicken

Gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of Jack
Daniel Its going to have to last him He has an entire rat
to get through

Travers Qualen and the rest of the expedition head out of the
shack a little groggy Odds are no one got much sleep

Travers shoves Hal toward a sketchy YOU ARE HERE map of the
mountain range and hands him the tracer monitor

TRAVERS
Still interested in staying alive

Hal matches the monitor to the map -- the blip is higher up

are crouched in the woods Brett gun in hand has no idea how
far out of his league he is Evan looks like hes having

Brett automatic held high circles off through the woods
Evan reluctantly lopes off toward his assignment

BELOW - GABES CAVE

Gabe pulls his jacket on -- reversed with the grey lining
out so the orange wont make him so easy to spot -- and
starts out towards the facing Tower -- his route clearly is

going to be along the rock wall Its relatively sheer but
there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy

races quietly through the woods in a parallel path with Hal
whos guiding the hang Brett circles around ahead of them
waiting Before he can jump out --

makes eye contact with Brett realizes what hes doing and
shakes his head as violently as he dares -- no dont --

BRETT

gives Hal a confident wink in response then pounces in front
of the gang gun held high

BRETT
End of the line

Travers Delmer Kristel and Kynette are startled but dont
immediately comply This throws Brett off his stride

Travers smiles and steps closer to Brett The others walk up
in front of Hal Travers actually laughs

TRAVERS
End of the line Thats classic

Youve got style So Im going to
give you a three-count to figure out
how to turn the safety off

Brett doesnt even look down -- he responds by FIRING a short
burst over Travers head

BRETT
Nice try Ive got one of these at
home Now drop ‘em
All drop their guns -- Brett unfortunately realizes at the
same time we do --
BRETT
Hey -- wheres the other guy --
HAL

(shouting)
Brett behind you

Too late -- Brett can only twist around half way before --
QUALEN

easily mows down Brett with his machine gun riddling him with
at least thirty rounds at close range Brett falls dead into
the snow Qualen walks up to Bretts corpse blood steaming in
the reddening snow and kicks it over

BELOW ON THE WALLSIDE

Gabe reacting to the sound of the machine gun fire climbs
up but theres nothing he can do --

TRAVERS AND QUALEN
and the others pick up their guns

TRAVERS
(turning to face Hal)
Time to --
Travers sees that Hal is gone -- hes escaped in the

confusion
IN THE WOODS - HAL

runs like his ass is on fire and practically collides with
Evan who is more panicked than ever

EVAN
What are we going to do --

HAL
You came up here to jump the spur --
(pulls Evans chute out
of his pack)
Thisd be a great time to do it

EVAN
(panicked)
But --
HAL
(quick)
Listen -- they dont know youre up
here -- Ill draw their fire youve

got to make the jump and get help

EVAN
I dont -- I -- uh --
HAL
(exasperated grabs
chute)
Unless you want to do it the other way

around

Evan snatches the parachute and runs off Hal wasting no
time runs in the opposite direction deliberately making as
much noise as he can slapping branches stomping on rocks

EXT WOODS - THE BANG
runs into the woods -- Qualen and Kristel hearing Hals noisy

retreat run after him But Travers stops for a second -- he
has spotted
EVANS FOOTPRINTS
in the snow -- not unlike a neon arrow
TRAVERS

runs in the direction of the footprints and quickly closes the
gap between him and

EVAN

who tries to pull on the chute and run at the same time --
its not easy Evan closes one of the three buckles -- but

TRAVERS
bursts out of the woods and runs up right behind him --
QUALEN AND KRISTEL

in the meantime get behind Hal in a clearing -- Kristel FIRES
over his head

KRISTEL
Stop

Hal caught again freezes in his tracks

EVAN
is still up and running -- he dodges Travers fire weaving
through trees getting the second buckle closed -- he sees the

edge just ahead and puts on an extra burst of speed --
TRAVERS

does likewise still firing -- his clip runs out but this
only buys Evan an extra few seconds --

THE SPUR

is a rock formation that just out like a diving board -- Evan
runs like hell to the edge of it --

TRAVERS

is right behind him and has slapped a fresh clip in place
but before he can shoot --

EVAN

dives off the edge and clasps the third buckle --
ON THE LEDGE - GABE

is directly below a few hundred feet -- looking up he thinks
Evan has made it -- but

ON THE SPUR EDGE - TRAVERS

throws himself down aims quickly but carefully and FIRES
twenty rounds towards Evans falling figure --

EVAN - FALLING
Evan LAUGHS -- he hasnt been hit --

GABE - WATCHING

GABE
Come on -- wait till youre out of
range -- dont pull it yet --
LONG SHOT - EVAN FALLING
Several seconds pass -- Evan is now several hundred feet down

and apparently out of firing range --

TRAVERS

stops firing -- but doesnt seem unhappy at all

EVAN

LAUGHS more and pulls the D-ring -- the parachute billows

open inflating --

CLOSE ON THE PARACHUTE

which has been shredded by bullets that hit the pack -- as
quickly as it inflates it deflates through dozens of

holes -- whatever resistance is left vanishes as the canopy
collapses

EVAN S

exhilaration turns to panic as he frantically pulls on the
chutes guide lines -- but the more he does this the faster
the chute caves in -- he SCREAMS as the chute finally gives
way and plummets right past

GABE ON THE LEDGE

who is powerless to do anything but watch --
EVAN

falls the long full five thousand feet desperately
uselessly pulling in the lines of the tattered chute until
hes tangled in it like a shroud --

GABE

turns away -- he cant watch Evan hit bottom -- he grimaces
and looks up with absolute hate at

TRAVERS

who doesnt see Gabe -- hes laughing at Evans desperation
which ends as his death scream is cut off

Hal is led over to the spur with the other gang members
behind him Hal looks as angry as Gabe

QUALEN
Was that Walker

TRAVERS
No such luck
(to Hal smiling)
Cheer up Everyone should die ina
spot this beautiful

ON THE LEDGE BELOW - CLOSE ON GABE
who has heard this and is shaking with fury
GABE
(quietly)
Dont worry You will

LONG SHOT OF MOUNTAIN

On top Hal reluctantly leads the gang away -- below we can
see Gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges

EXT RANGER STATION - HELIPAD - DAY

Winds or not Maggie is untying the helicopters rotor from
the bolts on the helipad Frank who has obviously just
awakened rushes out of the station

FRANK
Maggie -- what are you doing --

MAGGIE
Im going to go nuts if I sit here one
more hour

FRANK
Still a little breezy out Mag --

Maggie gets into the helicopter and starts the rotor

MAGGIE
(over engines whine)
You coming

Frank hesitates but climbs in the other side The helicopter
lifts off and heads toward the mountain range

EXT MOUNTAIN - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

The next obstacle Hal is leading the gang through is a
buttress -- a large stark boulder formation -- that lays
between the mountain theyve just come from and the nearest
mountain to it the Tower This is lower down from the
summit -- its solid and treeless

Hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they
climb in single file up to the top Terrain is flat enough
that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours

CLOSER ON HAL AND GANG

Hal leads the gang forward -- and keeps casting anxious
glances back at them And beyond them Travers notices this

TRAVERS
Forget about it Hes smart but hes
not invisible

Hal looks back Travers is right Theres absolutely no way
Gabe can come up behind them without being seen

LOWER DOWN ON BLUFF

where the bluff meets a tree-lined plain Gabe in hiding
watches Hal and the others go up No he cant follow them up
the bluffs side without being seen But Gabe moves closer to
the bluffs base -- Gabe shoves through some trees to the
beginning of

THE CHIMNEY
A crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff

GABE
pulls out his ancient binoculars and scans the crack
GABES POV - THE CHIMNEY

Starting with an outside view we can see that the crevice
runs all the way up and through the bluff -- but its a
zig-zag not a straight line

Picture a mine shaft designed by a madman The crack moves
upward then erratically to the side then straight up again
The width of the crack is uneven ranging from six inches to
six feet And thats just how it looks on the outside
Theres no telling what the interior is like

Gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack Its
hard to see much -- its very very dark But it looks as if
the crack goes all the way through the bluff as well as all
the way up it On this route Gabe can tunnel through the
mountain instead of going up the side

GABE

puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack
starting the long process of going up -- and through -- the
mountain formation

EXT COLORADO WILDERNESS - PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

A frenzy of activity as several dozen Treasury agents sift
through the snow for the wreckage of the CT-39 some taking
photos some taking videotapes some putting the pieces into
bags for analysis Many bags Many small bags

WIDER ON CRASH SITE

The Treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash
and its subsequent explosion -- there are few pieces here that
arent charred and fewer still that are any larger than a
paperback book

WRIGHT

unhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering
up the plane to a harried crash specialist from the FAA --
ROSS STUART (40s) -- who is organizing the debris

WRIGHT
What can you confirm

STUART
Well sir -- it crashed That I can
confirm

(condescending)
Weve been here just about one hour
These events take months to analyze
So if youll excuse me --

He walks away -- but Wright pissed spins him around

WRIGHT

No I dont think I will The reason
the FAA pays you is to exercise your
vast amazing knowledge of these
events So I expect you to come up
with some stunning insights something
a slow-witted fuck like me hasnt
already observed

(gesturing to wreckage)
One it didnt blow up in mid-air
because the debris isnt widely
dispersed But was there a bomb on
board that could have disabled it I
wonder

(pointing back)
Two There wasnt an attempted
landing Otherwise thered be debris
to the east of the wreckage where the
plane was coming from Did it come
straight down Thats got me
scratching my head too

(gesturing back to

wreckage)
And three the flight recorders
tracer led us here in the first place
So where is the goddamn thing That
ones got me all aflush with
curiosity

STUART
(a little cowed)
Youll be the first to know

WRIGHT
Oh I believe you

Wright storms off as agents delicately handle debris

EXT TOP OF THE BLUFFVISTA - DAY

A vista From this point you can see everything else in the
mountain range The only thing left thats taller is the
Tower a hundred yards away Between the two mountains lies a
drop of a mere four thousand feet
Hal has led the rest of the gang up to the edge Travers
approaches him furious

TRAVERS
I thought you said there was an easy
way across

HAL
There is You might not like it much

Hal points

FURTHER DOWN

A steep two hundred yard downhill climb leads to a wire that
bridges the two mountains The same wire we saw at the

beginning -- left behind from Susan Collins botched rescue

TOP OF BLUFF - HAL AND TRAVERS

HAL
Of course -- well have to do it hand
over hand Seems I forgot my harness
Sorry

TRAVERS

Dont be Lead on
Hal is surprised to see Kynette pull a harness out of his pack
-- the one Travers used earlier Disappointed Hal leads the
downward climb looking several hundred yards to
THE CRACK
running up and through the bluff coming out on this side

HALS FACE

registers a thought -- will he -- then dismissal Nah He
couldnt

INT THE CRACKCHIMNEY - CLOSE ON GABES FACE

Gabe is sweating straining in the dark climbing up -- thisd
be a good spot to pull back and take in the view except --

THE CHIMNEY
-- theres nowhere to pull back to Theres about two inches

of clearance between Gabes chest and the rock and about the
same between his back and the rock To the right there is no
light At all To the left theres no light Even above
there is no light because the crack isnt straight -- nature
isnt that obliging -- it zig-zags up Gabe is well within the
mountain rock Nothing could be closer to being buried alive
Gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up --
he takes out his penlight and turns it on --

GABES POV - INSIDE THE CRACK AROUND HIM

even this dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the
wall surrounding him up and down left and right --

GABES FACE

is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that
hes made a big mistake

GABE
I didnt need to see that I really
didnt
Gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark
EXT RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY

Maggie and Frank are flying low and fast over treetops and
snow -- both are intently staring down --

THEIR VIEW
is nothing but empty wilderness But a BUZZER goes off --
MAGGIE AND FRANK

turn their attention to the helicopters heat scope which
shows something alive beneath them

FRANK
Got em -- theyre under the trees --

Maggie smiles and slows the copter over a clearing --
EXT WOODSTHE COPTER

touches down Maggie is out of it before the rotor has stopped
turning running into the trees

MAGGIE
Hal Gabe

Maggie runs into the trees headlong into
A PACK OF WOLVES

that are preying on -- a body A pair of legs are gruesomely
sticking out from the feast One wolf turns to SNARL at Maggie
-- but Frank runs up and pulls a gun from a holster

Frank aims high and FIRES twice to scare the pack -- the
wolves run off Maggie goes to the body -- Frank holds her
back but she goes ahead anyway worried it might be Gabe --

TIGHT ON MAGGIE
as she examines the body --

MAGGIE
Its Evan
(she stands looks up)
Parachute failed

FRANK
(not unkindly)
Damn fool Why would anybody try that
in the middle of a storm

MAGGIE
Why would anybody try at all
(sighs)
Get the bag

INT BLUFF CRACKCHIMNEY

Gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now He pulls himself up with
his hands then braces his body with his back and pulls
himself up again -- hes not looking up because he cant see
anything yet anyway -- naturally this leads to --

A head and rock collision Gabes head crashes against a new
part of the crack as the passage thins out He gropes up
The passage is narrowing to the point that he cant get
through it Dead end

GABE
Shouldve taken that left turn at
Albequerque

Gabe backs down and starts to slide across the side With
his back wedged against the rear wall he uses his feet to
push against the forward wall

GABES POV - BLACK

Zero visibility -- Gabe cant see what hes shoving toward
There has never been light of any kind in here
GABE

blindly pushes to the side rattled by the difficulty of doing
this in the dark

GABE

Its just like any other side move --

you cant see where the fuck youre

going thats all --
Gabe stops and fishes out his penlight Turning it on its
clear those batteries havent gotten any more potent in the
last few hours Gabe shines it to the side
GABES POV - THE LIGHT
is fading fast A matchs last gasp is brighter

GABE

exasperated puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on

GABE
(garbled)
Much better

Gabe inches on to the side Looks up to see if the crack has
gotten wider It hasnt Gabe mumbles something phonetically
near motherfucker around the flashlight aiming it up --
GABES POV - UP

No opening larger than a mail slot --

GABE

still cursing still looking up still moving to the side --
he gets the opening he wants but not where he wants it --

The crack suddenly drastically widens as he moves to the
side -- since hes been bracing his back against the wall
Gabe falls out of control twisting around face down --
Gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches
himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack Its
now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself --

GABES POV - THE PENLIGHT

falls out of Gabes mouth and tumbles down ping-ponging from
one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long long
way down -- even after the light is gone we can still hear
the penlights receding clattering against the walls --

GABE

is now literally in a jam There are no handholds no
ledges and the walls are slick All he can do is remain
braced against the cracks walls until his already sore arms
and legs give out

EXT RESCUE HELICOPTER - NEAR BLUFFS BASE - DAY

Frank is now flying the helicopter -- a body bag is stashed in
the back and Maggie is in the passenger seat

MAGGIE
(motioning down)
Bring it down here

FRANK
Maggie --
MAGGIE
Just do it Frank
EXT BLUFF BASE
The copter touches down -- Frank doesnt turn it off Maggie

jumps out with a walkie talkie Frank makes another try

FRANK
Maggie this is dumb --

MAGGIE
No it isnt Im going to find
Brett -- I dont want to have to talk
to his widow too Fly Evans body
back to base -- Ill call you when
Ive found Brett Or Hal Or Gabe

Or anybody

Maggie runs off into the snow as Frank lifts off Maggie moves
quickly through the snow and it isnt long before she spots
multiple tracks in the snow -- they lead toward and up the
buttress Now shes really confused But with nothing left to
do she starts climbing up the side

EXT WIRE CROSSING - HALS POV

As weve caught Hal in mid-crossing hes looking from whence
he came -- the opposite side of the buttress where Travers
has a gun trained on him --
HAL

unhappily hangs high above the ground from the harness kindly
provided by Travers --

HALS POV - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE

Kristel is waiting also with a gun trained on him Hal
arrives and disengages -- the harness is pulled back

BUTTRESS SIDE OF WIRE

Kynette pulls the harness back and hands it to Qualen whos
standing next to Travers

KYNETTE
(motioning up)
Im going back

TRAVERS
Look -- this part is nothing
believe me --

KYNETTE

Walker should be coming up by now

Kynette automatic strapped to his chest rushes back to the
buttress summit

INT BUTTRESS CRACKCHIMNEY

Gabe is just as we left him Face down arms and legs pressing
against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls

Carefully Gabe takes one hand off the wall gets out his
lighter with the other and ignites it for a look --

GABES POV - UPWARD

Just as the crack has widened below him -- its wider above
him More important it slants at an easy enough angle to
allow him to walk up If only he can get up there

GABE

snaps the lighter shut pockets it and readies himself
Gabe steadily walks up the vertical passage by bracing

himself with one leg and one arm -- then moving the other
leg and arm up
Gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge
where the crack snakes into a sideways passage But there are
no handholds that will allow Gabe to get a grip and simply
swing over and climb up

GABE
(winded)
So much for the easy part

OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE CRACK

Gabe takes a deep breath readies himself and shoves himself
away from the wall with his arms pushes himself into a squat
against the opposite wall hanging for a second with no
support at all and he springs from that all into

THE DIAGONAL PASSAGE

Gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts
backsliding into the drop but he digs in with his boots and
his hands Safe at last Gabe carefully stands in a crouch --
and starts heading up

EXT BUTTRESS TOP
Kynette moves to the edge lies flat and looks down --
KYNETTES POV - ON THE BUTTRESS SIDE

Maggie is climbing up but shes still some way down -- and
the hood of her parka has been pulled over her head All
Kynette can see is what shes wearing an orange parka

KYNETTE
smiles and hits his headset radio

KYNETTE
Hes on the way up I could hear that
jacket before I could see it

TRAVERS (0S)
(over radio)
Then get the money kill him and get
back here Now

KYNETTE
(into radio)

Ill wait till he comes to me

Kynette flattens out to wait -- Maggie is coming up fast
INT MOUNTAIN CRACKCHIMNEY

Gabe moves up through the diagonal section -- the crack is
starting to go directly upward Gabe looks up --

GABES POV - TOP OF THE CRACK

Its coated with snow but not too much -- Gabe can faintly
make out light shining through up there

GABE

knows the top is twenty feet away Gabe starts up the easy
segment his back braced against one wall

EXT TOP OF BUTTRESS - KYNETTE
is staring down intently at the climber below --
KYNETTES POV - MAGGIE

is now almost to the top -- sweating with exertion she throws
her hood back

KYNETTE
keys his headset radio again

KYNETTE
(into radio)
Bulletin The climber isnt Walker --
its a woman

INT MOUNTAIN CRACKCHIMNEY

Gabe wedged near the top of the crack is ready to dig
through the snow -- but he hears the sound muffled and
distant of Kynette talking Gabe strains to hear -- a bad
time to come up Might be

EXT BUTTRESS SIDE

Maggie tired gets near the top and collapses resting for a
moment her arms on the edge -- Maggie looks up and is very
surprised to see Kynette standing over her smiling his gun
aimed down at her

KYNETTE
Rotten weather for a climb huh
(aims barrel)
I have two questions Id like to
trouble you with Ready

Maggie stares up frozen -- whatever she was expecting it
wasnt this

KYNETTE
This first ones easy Do you know a
man named Gabe Walker

MAGGIE
Yes
(breathless scared)
Where is he

KYNETTE
You dont know either I am sorry
That was question number two
(lowers barrel)
Thanks for your time

As Kynette tightens his finger around the trigger --

GABE

appears -- he completes his run toward Kynettes back and
kicks him over the edge --

KYNETTE

goes flying over Maggie his shots going wild -- but he
catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe
halt after skidding down ten feet --

GABE

yanks Maggie to her feet and onto the top Maggie gets a good
look at Gabe -- his clothes are slashed hes covered with
cuts and coated with slime and dirt from the crack He looks
like hes just spent a week in Hell Gabe doesnt react to her

reaction -- he just grabs her hand and runs
QUALEN
chooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge -- he

fires and automatic BURST at Gabe and Maggie

GABE
Come on --

MAGGIE
Where --
GABE
Here

Gabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack caving it
in -- Gabe falls two feet into

THE CRACK - MAGGIES POV
Gabe has grabbed and is hanging from a rope anchored to a
piton on the edge of the rock Hes also glowering up at

Maggie a little impatiently

GABE
Today goddamit

Gabe rappels down the rope into the darkness

MAGGIE

hesitates -- shes still getting used to the idea of being
shot at --

KYNETTE

woozy but recovered has climbed up -- he runs toward the

opening FIRING his gun --
MAGGIE

drops into the relative safety of the crack and rappels
downward

Maggie reaches ropes end thirty feet down as the vertical
passage again becomes diagonal Gabe is there waiting

KYNETTE
reaches the edge of the crack and FIRES down into it --
GABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN

-- bullets are RICOCHETING all over -- Gabe throws himself
over Maggie to shield her

KYNETTE

cant see what hes shooting at so he mercifully stops
Seeing the rope he bends down to climb after them --

GABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN

Gabe reaches up and tugs gently on the rope twice --
KYNETTE - REACHING FOR THE ROPE

-- which is tied in a standard climbers slipknot and comes
undone with a final tug -- the rope freed of the piton falls
down but Kynette firmly grabs hold of the end --

GABE

feels the rope go taut -- he yanks the rope down hard --

KYNETTE

gets more pull than he counted on and takes a head first fall
into the crack disappearing with a scream -- Qualen has just
arrived in time to see this --

GABE

looks over as Kynette bounces past him a few feet away -- the
rope goes slack in his hand as Kynette falls below

UP ABOVE - QUALEN
in frustration FIRES a burst straight down into the crack --
GABE AND MAGGIE - IN THE CRACKCHIMNEY

Gabe and Maggie move laterally through the crack -- now about
thirty feet from where they started so ricochets are a
serious but decreasing problem

The crack narrows from five to three feet Gabe edges Maggie
down into it and along a ledge moving to the side

GABE
This way
(off Maggies look)
I like the outside of the mountain
better too but --

Gabe and Maggie move along the ledge --

QUALEN
is still at the edge of the crack -- stymied Hes definitely
not climbing down after them -- he pulls back from the edge

IN THE CRACKCHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE

find a comparative point of comfort -- a toe-sized ledge
Maggie is moving ahead of Gabe
GABE
Stop

MAGGIE
We cant --

GABE
I need to stop

Exhausted Gabe braces himself against the wall

GABE
(looks at Maggie)
Im glad to see you -- but Christ I

wish you hadnt come
EXT WIRE CROSSING - TOWER SIDE - DAY

Qualen whizzes across the wire on the harness easily making
it to where Hal Travers and Kristel are waiting

TRAVERS
Dont tell me --

QUALEN
(disengaging)
Hes still alive

Travers takes a couple of heavy swings at the connecting bolt
with Hals axe Qualen grabs his arm before he can take a
third swing -- and looks at his watch

QUALEN
For another two minutes

IN THE CRACKCHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE

Gabe catches his breath All this is taking its toll on him

MAGGIE
It hurts just looking at you

GABE
(still panting)
Try it from this side Do you still
have your radio

MAGGIE
Its not going to work in here

GABE
Lets give it a try
(she hands it to him)
Im in bad need of a ride
(keys it)
Come in Rescue Unit --

EXT TOWER FACE - DAY

Hal is leading the expedition upward along a ledge -- the
radio in Travers pack comes to life

GABE (0S)
(over radio)

-- Come in Rescue One --

Travers stares daggers at Qualen Qualen looks to his watch

QUALEN
Patience
INT RESCUE STATION
The radio is reading Gabe loud if not clear -- the

interference of solid rock is garbling it But we can see out
the window that Frank is now between radios carefully
hauling Evans body from the helicopter to the station on a
collapsible gurney No one else is in the station

GABE (0S)
(over radio broken up)
-- Come in Frank --

INT BUTTRESS CRACKCHIMNEY
Gabe exasperated stops for a moment

GABE
Is there anybody else on the radio

Maggie shakes her head no

GABE
I take a year off and the department
goes to hell
(keys it)
-- Come in Rescue Unit --

TOP OF BUTTRESS - HIGH ANGLE

We can see there are three holes punched in the snow along the
cracks top --
CLOSER ON ONE OF THE HOLES

Recognizably the part of the crack Gabe and Maggie dove

into -- but perched on the edge is a block of plastic
explosive -- the detonator LED races down -- 020 -- 019 --

A SECOND HOLE

has been punched in the snow at the center point of the
crevices top -- another bomb has been planted there --

A THIRD HOLE

at the opposite end of the crevice has a third timer tied to
a third pack of plastics --

EXT TOWER FACE

Qualen is staring at his watch but pointing the others toward
the buttress

GABE (0S)
(via radio)
Come in Frank -- over --
QUALEN

Try to get thirty million in

entertainment out of this because he

is definitely in for thirty million

worth of pain
Gabes radio calls continue as Qualen extends his arm towards
the buttress and starts a silent hand countdown stage manager
style -- five -- four -- three --
INSERT - TIMER
The LED runs down -- 002 -- 001 --
THE BUTTRESS TOP
is shattered by a huge blast as the first bomb detonates --
INSIDE THE CRACKCHIMNEY

The walls are pulverized near the top and cave in raining
rocks further down towards --

GABE AND MAGGIE

who are hit by a blast of air booming down through the
confined space -- Gabe drops the radio -- Maggie slips but
Gabe grabs her -- both slide down the crack out of control
until it narrows to a three foot width -- and they stop --
Gabe shoves Maggie against the wall and tries to protect her
with his body as the rocks start to rain down --

TOWER FACE
Hal lunges at Qualen but is held back by Travers

HAL
You sick fuck --

QUALEN
Dont worry They may still be alive
That was the small one

RESCUE STATION

Frank stops wheeling the gurney and looks up at the far-off
blast and the smoke amazed

FRANK
Jesus -- thats some flare

INSIDE THE CRACK
Rocks tumble down it filling it in and sealing it off --
FURTHER DOWN - GABE

is braced over Maggie protecting her from the first round of
falling rocks but rolling THUNDER in the crack announces that
more is coming -- Gabe looks up as the noise gets closer --

ABOVE IN THE CRACK

The rockslide arrives -- the crack is filled in seconds with
rocks and dirt packing it in -- Gabe tries to hold on but is
shoved down by the falling rocks -- Maggie however is

buried in the crack as it fills --

GABE

is knocked down to a point where the crack narrows -- he stops
himself by jamming his body against the sides Suddenly its
quiet A little dirt whistles through but thats all

The cave-in has stopped as its filled in the crack above
And Maggie is in the middle of it Gabe unsheaths his ice axe

and starts hacking up to get at Maggie Dirt and rocks fall in
his face as he digs --
BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

Another LED is counting down from 300 -- 259 -- 258 --

INSIDE THE CRACK

Gabe frantically hacks at the ceiling of dirt -- rock and soil
tumble down but no sign of Maggie Gabe uncovers one of
Maggies feet Is it too late Gabe digs up around her --

Maggie realizes Gabe is there -- she starts kicking

Finally Maggie tumbles out of the cave-in -- gasping and
coughing but alive Gabe catches her and brushes the dirt
off her face

GABE
Are you all right

MAGGIE
(terrified coughing)
Why are they doing this

RESCUE STATION

Frank having lain Evans body to rest runs back to the
helicopter starts it up and takes off

INSIDE THE CRACKCHIMNEY

Gabe is leading Maggie horizontally through the crack fast
and furious --

MAGGIE
(looks up)
We might be able to get up that way --
theres an opening --

GABE
No -- there could be another bomb up
there -- even if there isnt we could

get another cave-in The only sure way
out is through the side

EXT TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY
Treasury agents sift debris as Davis runs up to Stuart

DAVIS
Ive got something here
STUART
Lets have it

DAVIS
Theres an unconfirmed report of a
distress call made from a plane that
crashed

STUART
Thats really really interesting but

(gestures around)
-- kind of old news dont you think

DAVIS
This call was supposedly made from a
plane that crash landed After it
landed

STUART
(waves it off)
Sounds like they got it wrong Next
time you interrupt my work make sure
its something I can use

INT MOUNTAIN CRACKCHIMNEY

Gabe and Maggie cautiously move along a single ledge --
finally some light can be seen thirty feet ahead as they
round a corner

GABE
(smiling)
Come on -- were almost out

The crack narrows and Gabe straddles it putting his feet on
the opposite edge to walk faster But before he can go on --

A HAND

grabs one of Gabes ankles from below and yanks him down --
Gabe tumbles painfully braking himself in front of

KYNETTE

bruised and bloody who has survived the earlier fall and made
his way out His look is not a forgiving one

KYNETTE
Miss me

Kynette smashes Gabes face with a devastating brass-knuckled
punch --
GABE

falls back desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself
from going all the way down -- as he weakly tries to get up --

KYNETTE

calmly opens his knife and re-laces his fingers into its
brass-knuckle handle

TOWER FACE

The gang and Hal watch the mountain top with very different
expectations and hopes -- their vantage point keeps them from
seeing where the crack actually comes out

QUALEN
(looks to Hal)
You might say a few words for your
friends -- this is the one that will
bury them

BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

Ready to blow -- 010 -- 009 --
IN THE CRACK - MAGGIE

can only look down helplessly at
GABE AND KYNETTE

fighting -- Gabe is on his feet but Kynette slashing at him
with his knife is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is

getting wider and finding footholds while crab-walking
backwards in the dark isnt east

Gabes in a rotten fighting position -- as he has to spread
his feet out wider as he backs up hes always lower than
Kynette

Gabe throws a punch at Kynettes stomach but theres no power
to it Kynette hits Gabe with a brutal knuckle-duster punch --
Gabe flies back several feet somehow managing to straddle the
crack walls -- which are now four feet apart Kynette moves in
for the kill

BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

The LED counts down -- 002 -- 001 -- 000 -- but doesnt
detonate A green light starts flashing but the bomb hasnt
gone off

IN THE CRACKCHIMNEY

Kynette moves in over Gabe and swings down with the knife --
But Gabe grabs his knife hand and adding his own force to the
swing imbeds the knife to the hilt in the rock wall

trapping Kynettes hand in the brass-knuckle handle

Gabe stabilizes himself on Kynettes trapped arm and gets a
little payback -- three solid roundhouse punches to Kynettes
face -- he then climbs up his pinned opponent stepping up
on Kynettes stuck hand as if it were a piton

TOWER FACE

Qualens smirk is wiped off his face The bomb didnt work

TRAVERS
What happened
QUALEN
Im not sure -- I set the timer --

Qualen gestures helplessly putting the radio in Hals reach
Hal takes advantage of this throws off Travers and grabs the
radio
HAL
(keying radio)
Gabe its a dud --

But the second Hal transmits --
BOMB NUMBER TWO

detonates over the central part of the crevice and as
promised its even bigger than the first --

INSIDE THE CRACK
The bomb instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice --
GABE AND MAGGIE

The RUMBLE of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable --
Gabe shoves Maggie forward --

GABE
Move
Maggie doesnt have to be told twice -- she and Gabe move out
the narrowed crack quickly but under the circumstances

this running looks damn slow --

KYNETTE

struggles with the stuck knife as the cave-in knocks him off

the wall and buries him instantly --

GABE AND MAGGIE

cover the last ten feet shoved forward by an airburst from
the giant explosion -- they make it to the cracks edge at

last but on the

OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN

Gabe and Maggie still have to cling desperately to the sheer

wall -- the airburst has turned the crack into a wind
tunnel -- its as if the mountain were trying to blow them
out

TOWER FACE

Hal shocked stares at the enormity of the explosion

looks serenely satisfied

QUALEN

When I was seventeen I was a sentry
on the East Berlin boundary
There was a problem then -- too many
defectors were managing to sneak
through the wilderness to the west A
man would take them through every
night of every week -- a man like your
friend

(beat)
He had quite a sense of humor Every
time he got someone through hed
radio us at midnight to let us know
how many Five tonight Eight
more have been freed tonight No one
could find the route It made me look
bad

(beat)
I looked day and night and finally I
found it A tunnel I didnt tell me
superiors I put a charge there with
a timer to trigger a radio receiver on
the detonator At midnight Our friend
made his radio report and I heard him
say seven before the explosion

Qualen
(beat)
They pulled eight bodies out of the
tunnel and I was promoted to
intelligence the next day

Hal stunned looks at the radio realizing Qualen tricked
him into detonating the bomb Travers grinning takes the
radio from Hal and pats him on the back

TRAVERS
Thanks We couldnt have killed him
without you

GABE AND MAGGIE - ON THE WALL

The force of the airburst as brief as it is strong is over
Dust slowly swirls out -- Gabe and Maggie raise their heads
Gabe looks back -- the crack is now sealed off Gabe takes a
piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to Maggie along
with the rope

GABE
Knock this in the side Make it firm

Maggie does as Gabe takes the binoculars out and climbs out
on a slim toehold so he can look up the wall

GABES POV - UP THE WALL

Gabe whips the binoculars up to the top edge of the wall Its
blurry -- Gabe focuses the binoculars on -- the third

bomb visible on the mountains edge The LED counts down

but its partly obscured All Gabe can see is the seconds not
the minutes that remain -- 42 -- 41 --

GABE (0S)
Bad news Theres another bomb up
there Weve got to move quick

Gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below All
smooth Until -- Gabe swings the binoculars back Theres a
lip ninety feet below leading into the wall A cave

GABE (0S)
Good news Theres a cave down there
GABE
puts away the binoculars and swings back to Maggie -- she lets

the length of rope drop Its thirty feet long Not even
almost long enough to get to the shelter Gabe leans against
the crack wall drained Now what

Gabe looks completely defeated Cant go up Cant go back in
Cant go down

MAGGIE
(frantic)
What are we going to do

GABE
(defeated)
Die Im sorry Maggie Im sorry you
got into this

Gabe and Maggie fuse together in a tight embrace -- a final
embrace But Gabe opens his eyes as the rope still in
Maggies hand brushes his cheek The end is frayed

Gabes eyes light up Inspiration Gabe breaks off the embrace
and snatches the rope from her -- he pulls at the end and

furiously starts unravelling it

MAGGIE
What are you doing

different segments wound together The helicopter flies
overhead -- and past

MAGGIE

GABE
Forget about it He cant hear you
(hands Maggie some rope)
Tie these together Tight

MAGGIE

-- Are you out of your mind --

GABE
This is rope from the Gordon exhibit
The way guys climbed then theyd tie
on three at a time -- this ropell
take around nine hundred pounds

MAGGIE
Gabe -- this rope is sixty years old

GABE
(misses the point)
Yeah they made it pretty good then
Each of these strands ought to hold
about 300 pounds before snapping

Gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton -- Maggie works on the
third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of
what she and Gabe weigh together

MAGGIE
(dazed)
Ought to About
(beat)
Will it hold

Gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop Ninety feet of
what looks like twine

MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING DOWN

To make this even trickier they have to swing over to the
side about fifteen feet to get to the cave -- meaning they
have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more
pressure on

THE ROPE

which looks sorely tested at one knot -- its coming undone --

MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING

They swing down lower -- twenty feet to the cave four
thousand to the ground --

INSERT - THE BOMB
-- 004 -- 003 --
MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING

They reach the end of the rope -- six feet above the cave
and fifteen feet away laterally

GABE
(shouting)
Swing towards it -- and drop
Maggie nods -- they start the swing over -- as they get over
the caves lip --
THE ROPE
snaps --
MAGGIE AND GABE
fall landing roughly on the caves narrow lip -- Gabe

starts to slip over but Maggie pulls him back as --
ABOVE ON THE WALL

The bomb detonates and starts raining debris -- an instant
massive rockslide --

MAGGIE AND GABE

dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past --
exhausted they collapse on the cave floor

THE HELICOPTER - OVER THE TOWER
Frank obviously is surprised by the nearby explosion

FRANK
What the fuck --

But he sees Kristel in a clearing Face down in the snow
First things first

EXT TOWERCLEARING

Frank lands near her and rushes over to her Frank turns her
over and breaks a capsule under her nose She wakes up with
a start and looks terrified

KRISTEL
What -- who are --

FRANK
Dont worry Im here to help

KRISTEL
(recovered)
Glad to hear it
Kristel sees the snap is off Franks holster -- she grabs it

spins it around and pulls the trigger CLICK Frank grabs
her wrist with a move faster than youd expect from him and
he yanks the pistol back

FRANK
Jailhouse load First chambers
empty --
(aims gun)
-- the rest arent Forgive me but
things have been a little strange this
morning

Nearby the helicopter radio crackles to life Frank backs
toward the helicopter keeping the gun trained on Kristel

But Frank only gets to the helicopter door before --

DELMER

comes out of hiding and empties a clip from his automatic into
Frank Frank is pinned to the door by the fusillade before he
can even get a shot off Travers runs over to Delmer and
shoves the barrel up

TRAVER
Stop
(explaining)
Youll damage the helicopter

As if to punctuate this Frank -- and the now ruined pilot

side door -- fall to the ground The radio continues to squawk

as Travers grabs Franks discarded gun

TRAVERS

Answer that

Kristel brushes the snow off her and goes over to the radio

Kristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket

TRAVERS
I almost believed you myself

Travers smiles and turns looking at

HAL

trembling with fury and grief bent over Franks body as the
last trace of vapor -- his breath -- trails from his lips
Hes gone Hal gently closes the eyes of his friend

HAL
(quiet)
Goodbye Frank

Travers moves up behind Hal and kicks him
TRAVERS

Time for number three Unless you want
to have a longer conversation with him
Travers kicks

elsewhere

(low)
Fuck off

him in the face knocking him into the snow

HAL
I think Ill wait here You just
murdered three of my friends Sooner
or later whoevers chasing you is
going to show up and return the favor
and Id love to watch

Travers puts his gun at Hals forehead and shrugs

Hals answer is a stony loathing stare He gets up But --

TRAVERS
Suit yourself You see we just had a
little interface with several branches

of the federal government -- one of
whose members I know has zero
imagination -- and I can tell you the

cavalry just isnt going to make it by
this week

(beat)
No youre taking us where we want to
go Because you want to return that
favor and you want to do more than
watch You want to kill me -- more
than anything even more than you want
to keep on breathing and with a
little more time you pray youll get
that chance

(tightens trigger)
Am I right

INSERT - HALS HAND

-- we can see Hal has palmed something from Franks body

INT CAVE - GABE AND MAGGIE

Dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening

the worst is over Gabe rolls Maggie over carefully

GABE
Are you okay

MAGGIE

but
My ears are ringing -- but Im all
right Gabe whats going on

GABE
(shows money in his pack)
This That plane crash -- its a half

dozen guys who were smart enough to
steal fifty million bucks but dumb
enough to drop it all over the range

Theyve got Hal as a bird dog -- and
right now theyre heading for the rest
of it

MAGGIE
Where

GABE
Its close to the lake -- Hals

probably leading them on the slowest
possible route down to it

(stiffly gets up)
I can get there first -- all I have to
do is make it along the north wall to
the Bitker ladder --

MAGGIE
A112 Jesus Gabe -- what do you
expect to do then

GABE
(aching)
Something -- subtle

Gabe lurches towards the cave opening looking more like
Quasimodo than a champion climber Maggie stops him

MAGGIE
Im going with you

GABE
No way Youre climbing back down --
try to get to the station or find some

help

MAGGIE
Im just as good a climber as you
are -- and right now Im definitely
in better shape

GABE

(hard)
And youre definitely not going --
Maggie stares Gabe down Guess who won all the arguments when
they were together Gabes face is a portrait of familiar
exasperation

GABE
Okay Come on --

As they move out of the cave together Gabe favors one foot

GABE
-- but the second you slow me down
Im leaving --
(slips on sore leg
Maggie catches him)
-- Im leaving you behind Understood

QUALEN (0S)
(over radio)
Not as far as wed be with the
helicopter

FURTHER DOWN ON MOUNTAINTOWER

Qualen Kristel and Delmer follow Hals lead down the side --
its not too steep a grade but its solid rock and its
covered with ice and fresh snow -- all have to brace
themselves with their hands to keep from slipping down

TRAVERS (0S)
(over radio)
We have less than half a tank of fuel

Eric -- if we burn it up treasure
hunting well never get off this rock
Now -- how far away are you

It looks like two miles but --

Qualens foot slides out from under him -- he catches himself

Agreed
HAL
can only hear Qualens end of the conversation -- but his face

shows he can guess what theyre talking about

CUT TO
GABES FACE - CLOSE
Gabes rattled too -- but for a brand new reason -- we PULL
BACK to see Gabe at
THE WIRES EDGE
where the wire -- that wire -- links the buttress with the
facing Tower Whipping in the wind it looks risky -- but

thats not the problem

Gabe stares at the other edge for a moment Immobile
Remembering Susans death Gabe shakes out of it when --

MAGGIE
Gabe
(beat)
Ill go first

GABE
(shakes his head)
If dont go first I might not go at
all

Gabe hooks his ankles over the wire and starts dragging
himself hand over hand across the abyss -- no safety line
this time As his weight pulls the line taut the wind rocks
him back and forth Gabe steadily drags himself out --

GABE ON WIRE - LONG SHOT

Fatigue stops Gabe in the middle -- a half mile up strung
between two gigantic mountains he looks as insignificant and
alone as a man possibly can be --
CLOSER ON GABE

Panting with exertion frozen -- he can barely hold his grip
and has an elbow crooked around the wire for support Gabes
eyes are shut -- he looks near collapse --

FLASHBACK - GABES POV

Gabe is falling from the wire in slow motion trailing

Susan -- she spirals out of reach as his line SNAPS him
back --

GABES

grip unconsciously relaxes -- but his eyes jolt open and he

clamps both hands shut on the wire Gabe drawing on some
inner fury drags himself with long sharp yanks --

MAGGIE
tensely watches Gabes crossing --
OVERVIEW - GABE
is about ten feet away from the end --
GABES UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE END OF THE WIRE
looks a lot further away than that --
GABE
pulls faster -- and reaches the other side Gabe maintains his
hand grip and swings his feet onto the ledge leaning back
against the wall to catch his breath
GABE
(winded shouting across)
Think you can beat my time

MAGGIE

smiles -- this is more like the Gabe she remembers She gets
on the wire and starts across ina fast easy rhythm

GABE

watches her grinning Admiration for Maggie is washing away
bad memories of Susan

GABE
(to himself)
Shit -- she is in better shape
Maggie pulls across fearlessly -- but --
INSERT - THE BOLT

on Gabes side of the wire is giving where Travers had
hacked at it -- just a millimeter but its pulling loose --

GABE

doesnt notice and shouts across at Maggie now half way

GABE
(enjoying it now)
Quit sandbagging it -- I havent got
all day --
INSERT - THE BOLT
is coming looser -- Maggies quicker crossing is thrashing the

wire and straining the bolts weakened anchoring --

GABE - WATCHING MAGGIE

who is now twenty feet away -- fifteen -- ten -- five --
INSERT - THE BOLT

pops out of the wall as if it were shot --

THE WIRE

which was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm --
Maggie stunned and without options lets go two feet short
of the ledge --

GABE

drops low just as Maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out
towards hers in one lightning-fast motion --

THEIR HANDS

catch --

GABE

maintains his grip on Maggies hand but her weight nearly
pulls him off the ledge -- Maggie drags him down the window

goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledges
bottom but their grip holds
All of this in a split second Maggie hangs from Gabes arm
locked in terror -- but skill wins out over fear She finds a
handhold with her free arm and climbs up to the ledge with
Gabes help Maggie collapses into Gabes arms and they fall
back against the wall but Gabes the one whos really holding
on tight

GABE
That -- tears it
(gasping)
Youre not coming any further

MAGGIE
(just as breathless)
Gabe -- youre going to get yourself
killed --
GABE

(breath almost back)
Maybe But Im not getting you
killed

(she starts a reply)
Look Maggie I dont know whatll
happen when I catch up with Hal -- but
Ive got to know one thing for sure --
that youre making it off this
mountain Alive

Gabes eyes are pleading Maggie hesitates But gives in

MAGGIE
Okay
Gabe lightly kisses Maggie -- he doesnt want to turn this
into a farewell kiss afraid that thats really what it might
be They stand -- and separate Gabe moves away
GABE
Get on the trail and stay out of
sight

(beat)
Ill see you on the ground

Maggie wonders if she will as Gabe vanishes around a corner
EXT TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - CLOSE ON BODY BAG

as the zipper is pulled down -- before we can see anything we
mercifully reverse POV to

WRIGHT DAVIS AND STUART
near a helicopter look down with disgust Davis turns

WRIGHT
I give up What was it

A SEARCH PILOT zips the bag back up

SEARCH PILOT
ID says this used to be your pilot
(beat)
And we found him seven miles east of
the wreck

Davis and Wright look at each other drawing the same
conclusion

WRIGHT
A hijack

The plane was hijacked Son of a
bitch --
STUART

Oh give me a break Your pilot lost
it when the flight started going
south and he bailed --

SEARCH PILOT
Excuse me -- but theres no parachute
there Check it yourself

away

Before this can go on a FORENSICS AGENT runs up to Stuart

carrying a recorder

FORENSICS AGENT
Sir -- we found the flight recorder --
it was driven twenty feet deep into a
crater It was demolished but we
salvaged the recording --

STUART
(grabbing it away)
Ive heard a thousand of these Wright
-- whoever was at the stick is going
to begin by screeching the Lords
Prayer and wind up screaming Oh
shit at ground zero --

Stuart clicks the recorder on with a flourish but his
look melts as the voice of FBI agent Matheson explains

smug
MATHESON (0S)

(shouting rushed)
-- the moneys been stolen -- Travers
and the pilot were in on it -- the
pilots dead but Travers took the
cash and made a mid-air transfer to a
jet flown by Qualen -- controls wont
respond --

(screaming)

Matheson is cut off by the sound of impact which is followed
by silence Wright gently turns the recorder off

WRIGHT

Guess were both right Stuart Thanks
for your expertise

(turns to pilot)
Well

(jerking a thumb back)
Youll be waiting till Groundhogs Day
for him to pull his head out of his
ass -- lets get it in the air

Wright Davis and the pilot scramble into a helicopter --
Stuart pauses but goes after them

EXT MOUNTAIN WALLTOWER - HIGH ANGLE - GABE MOVING ON A
LEDGE

thats a little narrower than your coffee table Its got
irregular breaks causing it to go up or down several feet --
and Gabe is jogging it leaping across the ledges gaps

leaning toward the wall -- and away from the four thousand
foot drop
Gabes gotten his second wind -- he keeps jumping from ledge

to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity
and with renewed purpose Gabe makes the last jump to a
section of ledge near the bottom of

THE BITKER LADDER

which consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable
bolted into the rock running two hundred feet to the top --
something left behind by a past expedition now a tourists
toy And the bottom rung is three feet above Gabes
outstretched arms

GABE
Hasnt gotten any lower in the last
year
(coiling for jump)
Bitker you cheap bastard Would
another four feet have killed you

Gabe leaps up grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile
of air and he shoots up the ladder as we PULL BACK --

WIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN WALL

A closer look at terrain seen earlier -- fifty yards away from
the ladder a waterfall is spewing out of the wall giving the
appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak

As we track Gabe up the ladder we can see where the waters
coming from -- a whirling lake on top of the mountain Its
constant motion keeps it from totally freezing but the lake
is still coated with a veneer of ice moving in thick chunks
through circular currents on the surface

ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL AND GANG

are negotiating the grade which is slippery thanks to the
fresh thick snow -- we can see from their relative position
to the lake that Gabe has a lead on them A very slight one

TOP OF LADDER - GABE

pulls himself over and starts running -- as he does he
uproots a big 3 x 3 park service sign commemorating the
BITKER CLIMB and takes it with him moving ahead into a

WOODED AREA

where Gabe replants the sign near the top of another slope
Gabe heads down towards some rocks -- -- and spots the third
case which took a tough landing on one rock -- its shattered
into halves and the bands of 5000s are scattered around in
the snow

Gabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the

cash -- soaked by the snow theyve frozen into ice bricks As
Gabe stuffs them into his pack hes startled by something
coming over the rock -- Gabe whirls around to face

A RABBIT

thats landed in the snow and looks a lot more frightened than
Gabe was Gabe leans back relieved For now

EXT FURTHER UP ON SLOPE - HAL AND GANG

are closer now -- but as they move down Hal freezes in place
as he sees the Bitker sign some distance ahead The sign is
out of place A signal from Gabe -- he is alive And here

Qualen and the others check the monitor Hal takes the
opportunity to back up to a rock formation and swiftly subtly
wedge something into a crack behind his back --

INSERT - THE OBJECT

is what Hal lifted off Franks body -- a speed load cylinder
from a revolver with six fresh bullets in it

QUALEN
checks the monitor -- the relative position shows theyre --

QUALEN
Almost there

-- but Qualens grin is wiped away as he looks down at --
THE MONITOR

-- the tracer blip is moving -- fast -- away from their
position

QUALENS
face shifts from incredulity to realization to rage

All eyes are on the monitor -- Hal at the rock formation has
one hand behind his back

INSERT - HALS HAND

shakes a box of matches from his sleeve -- he slides a single
wooden match halfway out of the pack -- and ignites it with
his thumbnail --

HAL

moves away from the rock to draw their attention from what
hes been doing --

HAL
Oh no -- you didnt lose another
one did you
Delmer clicks off his safety and aims at Hal -- Qualen runs
into the woods guided by the monitor -- Kristel follows

Delmer backs Hal up at gunpoint Hal deliberately moves in a
semi-circle putting Delmers back to the rocks
DELMER
What about him

QUALEN
(over his shoulder)
Kill him Now

Delmer grins as he aims at Hal

DELMER
Tell me -- where would you like the
first half dozen shots to go

INSERT - THE MATCH

has burned more than halfway down to the rest of the box
which is behind the speed load cylinder --

HAL AND DELMER
HAL
(hands up)
As long as youre taking requests --

how about -- the base of your spine

Delmer smiles and starts to squeeze the trigger -- Hal tenses
up its now or never --

INSERT - THE MATCH

burns down to the box igniting all the matches --

ON DELMER

as there is the sudden sound of six distinct consecutive

gunshots behind him -- the fires blasted the powder in all
the bullets Delmer startled spins around and FIRES up
FIRES down FIRES across -- by the time he realizes no ones

there and he turns back around to find --
-- Hal is gone vanished into the woods

FOLLOWING QUALEN

through the woods -- up a slope around a tree down another
slope -- his eyes fixed on the screen and the blip thats
zig-zagging just ahead of him

QUALEN
(tagging headset radio)
Travers Get down here Now
TRAVERS
is trying to repair the helicopter door when the call comes

TRAVERS
Have you found the money

QUALEN (0S)
No Walker has

Travers furious flings the door aside jumps into the copter
and starts the rotor

QUALEN

is running alone following the monitor lead -- until he sees
a band of 5000s in the snow Sure hes on the right track
Qualen picks it up and picks up his pace too But we can see
that behind him and higher up --

GABE

who is on a rise behind a rock watches Qualens futile
pursuit from a distance amused Amused until --

KRISTEL
You would have lived longer if you
werent such a smartass

Gabe spins his head around -- and his temple smacks into
Kristels gun barrel

KRISTEL
You telegraphed this kind of stunt
with that joke snowman Too bad for
you were not all gullible

Kristel starts to squeeze the trigger

GABE
Good thing for Qualen you are

KRISTEL
(pauses wary)
What do you mean

GABE
When he comes back hes going to
shoot you and the other guy grab the
money and take off with Travers
KRISTEL
(squeezing trigger again)
No sale Say night-night --

GABE

(talking fast)
He already blew up one of your pals in
that crevice And Ive been in that

farther with two people than with
four

Kristel eases back with the gun

KRISTEL

GABE
Youve also got all the money And I
can show you how to get off the
mountain with it Right now

ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN - HAL

tears into a clearing trying to put some distance between him
and Delmer -- as soon as hes out in the open though

THE HELICOPTER

thunders over Hal -- Travers FIRES down at Hal through the
doorless pilots side Bullets kick up tufts of snow at Hals
heels as he runs down into a steep sloping wooded area The
tree cover is too thick for Travers to take good aim Looks
like temporary refuge -- but

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

Travers finds a new use for the search copters heat
scope -- using the blip that betrays Hals body heat as a
guide Travers can still fire down through the trees at

HAL

whos still running down the grade -- he hasnt been hit yet
but theres an awful lot of bad luck in the air --

TRAVERS

banks the helicopter around and up for another pass
EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE MOUNTAINTOWER WOODS - QUALEN

is slogging uphill after his own tracer blip -- which is
turning back around and heading towards him Qualen aims his
gun and waits but at the top of the hill --

THE RABBIT

that spooked Gabe earlier sticks its head up for a curious
sniff It has the tracer fastened to its neck with a currency
band Furious Qualen FIRES at the rabbit -- it safely speeds
away as Qualen smashes the useless tracer monitor and turns
around

EXT TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

On the heat scope The blip that represents Hal -- vanishes
Delmer who has caught up is at the edge of the tree-lined
area -- he looks up at Travers
TRAVERS
(keying headset radio)
Hes hiding twenty yards in -- be
careful

EXT WOODS - DELMER

replies beeping twice on the headsets ear button as he
moves downhill into the woods closely following Hals

tracks -- they lead up to the replanted BITKER sign Just
big enough to hide behind Delmer smiles and advances toward
the sign --

-- and looks behind it Nothing but a mound of snow Delmer
looks again to the tracks which lead toward

A SMALL ROCK FORMATION

also big enough to conceal Hal Delmer moves toward it as --
BEHIND THE BITKER SIGN

the mound of snow shifts as Hal climbs out silently shaking
off the cover -- the snow hid him not only from Delmer but

from the heat scope as well --

TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

hovers overhead watching Delmers blip on the heat scope --
but Hals blip returns rushing ahead --

TRAVERS
(keying headset radio)
Hes right behind you

DELMER

whirls around at the warning his gun BLAZING but Hal is too

fast -- he swings the sign like a club knocking Delmers gun
away into the snow Before Hal can swing again Delmer
brutally punches Hal in the face -- stunned Hal drops the
sign --

IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

Travers cant do anything now but watch the heat scope as if
it were a video game -- now its just one big blip --

DELMER AND HAL

thrash around in the snow pummelling each other -- Hals
getting the worst of it as Delmer manages to get on top of
him and deliver a series of punishing blows to his face Ready
to end it Delmer tries to get the bolt gun off a clip on his
front pack strap -- but he has trouble unfastening it Hal

rallies with a solid punch to Delmers face Hal gets Delmer
off of him and follows with two more

Delmer is knocked away landing on the sign board -- but clear
from Hal -- another chance to get the bolt gun off --

Hal quickly moves to the sign and grabs its post -- before
Delmer can move off the signs board Hals running forward
shoving the sign ahead of him with Delmer on top -- Hal lets
go and the sign with Delmer sleds downhill on the hard

packed snow --
TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS
can now see one blip moving quickly away from the other --

TRAVERS

Answer me Is it Tucker
Hal smiles and beeps twice -- affirmative
IN HELICOPTER

Happy at last Travers takes off after the blip flying down
the incline and staying just above the trees strafing an
intense fusillade at

DELMER

whos screaming as a storm of bullets rip through him and the
sign and the surrounding snow keeping pace with his downhill
slide --

TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

FIRES until his clip is empty -- he heads for the end of the
tree line as his target comes out skidding to a stop in the
snow Travers gleefully moves lower down for a closer look
but is shocked to see

DELMER - ON SLED

Delmers highly perforated body rolls off the sign as it
finally skids to a dead halt

CLOSE ON TRAVERS
who is apoplectic -- hes just shot one of his own men
HAL (0S)

(over radio)
Thanks loads

you
Travers looks down at the heat scope -- blank

Stymied Travers furiously banks it away from the wooded area
and circles around the mountains other side

EXT MOUNTAIN - SLOPING GRADE - GABE AND KRISTEL

Gabe hands on his head moves down a slope near a mountain
edge ahead of Kristel whos aiming her gun at his back
KRISTEL
How much further

GABE
(stops)
Its right over there

Gabe nods ahead indicating what looks like a
A SHED

that is partially obscured by snow about twenty feet distant
across a snowy plateau

GABE AND KRISTEL

GABE
Its a storage locker for the rangers
Everything you need to get off the
mountain is in there -- skiis food --
Ill show you --

Gabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly
moving ahead again -- Kristel suspiciously notices this --

KRISTEL
Dont move

Kristel gets ahead of Gabe and walks backward keeping her gun
trained on him as she crunches through the snow

KRISTEL
Skiis food -- and maybe guns too
right
(moves backward)
Keep walking Not too close

GABE
Wed make better time walking straight
ahead Qualens not going to be
hopping down the bunny trail too much
longer

KRISTEL
(walking backward)
Right So Id better have one less
problem when he arrives

GABE
(knowing this means him)
Dont fuck up You still need me to
show you a route off the mountain

KRISTEL
Youve worn that one out Walker --
(snaps back bolt)
-- Ill find my own way down

Kristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot Gabe but her
feet sink through the crystallized snow cover -- --

Kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it
collapses under her -- shes pulling the trigger and SHOTS

go wild as she sinks and sinks --

ON GABE

whos had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same

fate -- as he scrambles back to solid land Kristels SHOTS
arc up through the snow toward him and the snow crumbles
around him -- but he bellies ahead as --

ON THE SNOWDRIFTS TOP

Kristels GUNSHOTS slow and finally stop the very last of
them loosening the snow around --

THE SHED

that was obscured by snow was a tall three-sided park service

sign shouting WARNING -- SNOWDRIFT -- DO NOT CROSS in eight
different languages The rest of the snow falls away from it
revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration -- a

stick-figure fatally sinking into the snow
GABE

bellies ahead flat on his stomach testing the snow with the
ice axes staff -- only when he hits something solid with it
does he get back up to his feet But the sound of ice-crusted
snow CRUNCHING above Gabe alerts him that --

QUALEN

has just hit the top of the slope and spotted him -- Qualens
gun BLAZES down --

GABE

is on the run but its that lead-footed slow motion stuff
that only happens in nightmares -- with every step a foot
breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of

snow -- Gabe stays just ahead of the barrage making it into
A THICK WOODED AREA

which is very temporary refuge -- Qualen will be down in
seconds Gabe looks down the slope Running is impractical So
he sits down

QUALEN
arrives where Gabe was and looks down the slope --
QUALENS POV - GABE

is whizzing down the slope in a sitting position using his
back and his shoes as gliders the ice axe as a rudder
Alpinists call this a sitting glissade Colorado climbers
call it butt skiing Some psychos do this for fun

GABES POV - THE SLIDE

is anything but fun -- Gabe cant control his speed or
direction well at all -- Gabe barely manages to steer in and
out of trees and boulders in his path --

QUALEN

starts running down the slope -- he doesnt have speed but he
does have the machine gun -- he FIRES short bursts at --

GABE

who tries to steer away from the line of fire -- Gabe is hit
in the shoulder -- he slides out of control and rolls down --

-- to the slopes bottom Gabe painfully lifts himself up and
moves through the woods coming out of the trees to

THE LAKE

The bridge that spans it is ahead of Gabe -- but there is
nothing around but flat terrain Its a beautiful sight but
no good for hiding And Qualen is right behind him

EXT MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL

rushes down to Delmers body -- in the snow he finds the
discarded machine gun and holds it up but stray bullets from
Travers fusillade have made it inoperable Hal tosses it
aside and checks Delmers bloody pockets for more weapons
Nothing Just a couple of machine gun clips and the bolt gun

EXT MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MAGGIE
is wending her way down a hiking trail on the opposite side of
the mountain In plain view

TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

is circling the mountain -- he spots Maggie from on high and
moves down after her

MAGGIE

hears the helicopter and turns around -- she has no way of
knowing it isnt Frank so she takes off her jacket and waves
it as a signal --

MAGGIE
Frank Down here

The helicopter moves down until Maggie can see --
TRAVERS

is at the controls

MAGGIE

starts running but its useless Nowhere to hide Travers
hovers over her FIRING ahead of her FIRING behind her not
to kill just to make a point Hes in charge

EXT MOUNTAIN TRAIL

Maggie finally stops -- Travers lands the copter and opens the
passenger door keeping his gun trained on her

TRAVERS
Hop in I know someone whod like to
see you again before he dies

EXT BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE - QUALEN

moves down to the slopes edge noting with pleasure the blood
in the snow Gabe is wounded and hes left a trail asa
bonus

Qualen moves out lakeside -- nothing visible but the thick
flat ice chunks circling in the currents But Gabes
footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge

Qualen starts to run across the bridge but stares down --

QUALENS POV - THE BRIDGES PLANKS
The blood -- and slush from Gabes boots -- end halfway
across

QUALEN

Smiles and shakes his head Too obvious Gabe is hiding
underneath the bridge in the three foot deep network of steel
supports Qualen slows his pace staring down through the
thin but visible cracks between the planks

TIGHT CLOSE-UP - GABES FACE

grimacing shivering ashen from his wound and exertion --
lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge

QUALEN (0S)
Youve come a long way to die

QUALEN
enjoying himself slams a fresh clip into his machine gun

QUALEN
If you were smart youd have left
your friend behind I would have
Theres no shame in staying alive

Qualen stops staring down Through the gaps Gabes parka is
visible Right where the blood trail ends

QUALEN
(aims down)
But youre not smart And now youre
going to die from an overdose of
heroism

Qualen BLAZES the gun into the planks --
UNDER THE BRIDGE - GABE

is clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge
several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being
shredded by the FUSILLADE -- without the parka Gabe is
freezing and too many bullets are coming too close for
comfort as they RICOCHET on the bridges supports --

QUALEN

stops firing and kicks away the planks which are a tangle of
toothpicks at this point -- Qualen bends down --

-- and sees theres nothing in the parka except for Gabes
back Qualens face registers anger and surprise as -- -- Gabe

appears at the edge of the hole -- before Qualen can react
Gabe swings up with his ice axe hooking it around the
shoulder strap of Qualens machine gun -- Gabe yanks down

and Qualen falls head first
UNDER THE BRIDGE

with Gabe -- Qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a
leg on one of the steel supports -- but both

THE ICE AXE AND THE GUN

fall landing on separate chunks of ice floating underneath
the bridge --

IN THE SUPPORTS

Gabe pulls himself through the girders to Qualen and punches
him with his good arm but Qualen is unfazed -- neither are in
good position its like a fistfight on a jungle gym -- --
Qualen steadies himself to savagely punch Gabe in his

shoulder wound -- Gabe YELLS in pain and tries to block the
next one but Qualen punches him again and Gabe lets go of
the support falling -- -- on the way down Gabe grabs

Qualens leg with his good hand -- too low to grab the bridge
Gabe dangles just over the water raising his legs above it as
Qualen tries to kick him off -- -- Gabe holds onto Qualens
leg and swings on it like a pendulum -- Gabe twists the leg
-- Qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go --

both

QUALEN AND GABE

fall -- they land hard not in the water but on a

vaft-sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the
current Their weight teeter-totters the ice as they get up --
theyre in danger not just from each other but from

THE FAST APPROACHING WHIRLPOOL

where the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling
vortex that drains into the waterfall --

ON THE ICE RAFT

Qualen and Gabe circle each other like cautious boxers as the
ice itself swirls in the current -- if either makes the wrong
move theyll both go over Gabe swings at Qualen but Qualen
throws a leg under Gabe and stiff-arms him down -- Gabe hits
the ice hard his chest hanging over the side -- Qualen moves
in to shove him off -- but their combined weight on the same
side of the ice starts to tip it over -- Gabe viciously
kicks Qualen back gashing his face with his boots crampon as
Qualen grabs the ice rafts opposite side levelling it

QUALEN
(wiping the gash)
Stalemate isnt it

GABE
(winded)
Not any more
Gabe still prone reaches out -- the chunk of ice with

Qualens machine gun is floating by Gabe snatches up the gun
and pulls the trigger Nothing but an empty CLICK

QUALEN
Far more intimidating when its
loaded

The chunk of ice with Gabes ice axe floats by Gabe -- Gabe
grabs for it but misses -- as the ice raft spins around

Qualen manages to snatch it up -- Qualen scythes it down at
Gabe slamming the blade into the ice as Gabe rolls away --

WIDER VIEW - THE ICE RAFT

is nearing the center of the whirlpool -- the current is
faster and stronger here -- if it doesnt swallow the ice
raft it will definitely upend it --

QUALEN AND GABE

stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance -- Qualen
swings out at Gabe with the axe Gabe ducks and tries to go
low to hit Qualen with the gun but Qualen swings the axe down
again whizzing right past Gabe as it sinks into --

THE CENTER OF THE ICE RAFT

-- a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade --

GABE

quickly reacts jumping onto another bed-sized chunk of ice
floating by landing on his stomach and braking himself by
digging his crampons in -- just as --

QUALEN

realizing what deep shit hes in looks for another chunk of
ice to make the same move -- to sees one just out of reach
Qualen pulls the ice axe out of the rafts center to drag the
other chunk closer in -- -- as he does the entire raft
disintegrates under him -- Qualen plunges into the water and
tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left --

-- but now at the center of the whirlpool Qualen is drawn
into the vortex --

GABE
struggles to his feet and looks down wincing --
GABES POV - QUALEN GOING DOWN

Qualens inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as
he shoots down to the bottom of the lake -- and beyond --

QUALENS POV - UNDERWATER

Qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the
lakes tunnel drain --

ON THE MOUNTAIN WALL - THE WATERFALL

BLASTS OUT full force hurling a still thrashing Qualen a
half a mile to the ground below

GABE

has no time to celebrate -- the chunk of ice hes on leaves
him moments from the same fate One more time around and
its down the drain Gabe takes a deep breath No choice He
leaps --

WIDER VIEW - THE ICE - GABE LEAPING

-- from one chunk of ice to the other running the way you
would across stones in a stream zig-zagging to catch the ones
big enough to support him -- only his crampons keep him from
sliding off only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the
ice chunks which shoots away from him in his wake --

GABE

lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge No choice --
Gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge

supports -- his hand catches -- but its slippery and hes
weakened -- Gabe slides off but --
A HAND

reaches down and grabs him --
HAL

pulls Gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge Gabes
surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as Hals

HAL
(eyeing Gabes ruined
shirt)
Nice outfit
(hands him his parka)
I know you never liked the orange but

GABE
Didnt care for the Smokey The Bear
hats either Thats why I quit
(pulls on parka)
You all right

HAL
I feel better than you look I can
live with that

Gabe looks down at the parka -- its completely full of
bullet holes

GABE
Hardly seems worth zipping huh
(serious now)

Frank
Hal sobers -- shakes his head no A cloud passes over Gabes
face
HAL
Its not over Gabe Travers took the
helicopter

INSIDE HELICOPTER - FLYING ELSEWHERE OVER MOUNTAIN

Maggies hands are cuffed to a bar on the helicopters roof
Travers keys his headset radio while piloting the copter

TRAVERS
(into radio)
Qualen -- Kristel -- come in --
HAL AND GABE ON BRIDGE
Gabe hears Hals borrowed headset radio crackling -- he holds

his hand out to Hal
GABE

May I

(dons it keys it)
They cant talk right now Travers
Kristels busy making snow angels --
and Im not sure but I think Qualen
is still falling

(radio silence)
Any messages

A moments silence -- then --

MAGGIE (0S)
(over radio)
Gabe

GABE
(keying it)
Maggie --

INSIDE COPTER - TRAVERS
yanks the radio off Maggie and puts it back on --

TRAVERS
(into radio)
You wanted to make a trade earlier
Walker -- still interested

GABE (0S)
(pause)
Ive got the money Fly to the lake
And if you touch her --

Travers cuts off the radio smiles and banks the helicopter

down around the mountain wall

GABE AND HAL ON BRIDGE

Now what

GABE
I have no fucking idea
(holds Qualens gun)
Empty

(smiling)
Not for long
Hal fishes into his pockets and pulls out one of the ammo
clips he took from Delmer Gabe tries to force it into the
guns stock -- but its the wrong size

GABE
(sagging against rail)
Why cant anything be easy
THE HELICOPTER
thunders around the mountain wall getting closer --

HAL AND GABE

have crossed the bridge near the mountain edge -- Gabe now
wearing his pack again nods over to the wooded area

GABE
Stay over there --
HAL
Look -- let me --
GABE
-- what throw snowballs at him
Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie
out of here
HAL
(relenting)
Count on it
(beat)

And Gabe Thanks for tagging along

GABE
(smiles)
Thanks for asking I forgot how much I
enjoyed rescue work

Gabe limps toward the mountains edge as Hal runs into the
woods

THE HELICOPTER

blasts along the wall towards the lake -- the waterfall and
the ladder are just ahead The copter radio crackles --

WRIGHT (0S)
(from radio)
Come in Rocky Mountain Rescue --
urgent -- come in --
Travers recognizes the voice -- frowning he snaps off the
radio and banks the helicopter up over the top --

TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

tops the precipice revealing Gabe standing on the end of a

narrow spur -- it just out from the edge like a diving board
Gabe has his pack on one arm -- the money is visible Gabe
levels Qualens emptied gun on Travers and the copter -- this

bluff is all he has left

GABE
(over radio)
Remember that bet you made About
whether I could find the money for you
or not
(holds pack over drop)
You won

Travers helplessly flies in low tight circles over Gabe and
the spur -- if he shoots Gabe the money falls too Travers
presses his gun at Maggie

TRAVERS
(into radio)
Tll kill her --

GABE
(over radio)
You do and the spring thaws going to
be worth thirty million bucks
(pause)
No rush Im sure youve got lots of
time

TRAVERS
(into radio)
All right Drop the gun first

GABE
(into radio)
When shes safe on the ground

EXT SPURCOPTER

Travers has no choice but to give in -- he gives Maggie the
handcuff key and she frees herself as he flies away from the
spur touching the copter down on the mountain top

TRAVERS
(to Maggie)
Get out
Maggie moves out the door and stares uncertainly at Gabe

GABE
(shouting)
Run
(she doesnt)
Run

Maggie runs for the trees When Gabe is sure shes safe he
throws the gun away -- but keeps the pack suspended over the
edge

GABE
(into radio)
Now come and get it My arms getting
tired

EXT HELICOPTER

Travers flies the copter up and over until he and it are five
feet away from Gabes position on the spur Gabe is buffeted
by the copters wind but stands firm Travers levels his gun
at Gabe through the open passenger door as Gabe heaves the
pack in Travers doesnt even look down -- he just stares at
Gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot

GABE
(shouting)
Dont you want to count it
Puzzled Travers takes his gun hand and rips open

THE PACK

The 5000s are there -- but theyve been shredded by
Qualens earlier blast of gunfire Few if any of the bills
are passable

TRAVERS

stares down incredulous -- as he does --

GABE

rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt
gun from his waist --

Travers looks up and raises his gun at Gabe -- but Gabe fires
first -- the bolt imbeds itself high in Travers chest
Gasping Travers drops his gun -- it falls over the pack and

out the open door -- Travers clutches at his chest --
GABE
Dont spend it all in one place you
son of a bitch

Travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the

helicopter -- it spins around and Gabe has to instantly
flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him -- Gabe looks
down as --

THE HELICOPTER

quickly begins to spiral down in wide aimless circles --
Travers has clearly lost control --

GABE
stares down coldly waiting for the crash -- but --
INSIDE THE COPTER - TRAVERS

wont give up -- sweating bleeding he sits forward and
grabs the stick seizing control of the helicopter again --

GABES POV - THE HELICOPTER

stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and
up -- with clear purpose --

CLOSE ON GABE

eyes widening with realization Gabe gets up from the spur and
starts running back towards the woods -- several hundred yards
from safety -- before he can get very far --

THE HELICOPTER

tops the precipice edge and sweeping low over the snow it
gets between Gabe and the trees cutting him off --

WOODED AREA - HAL AND MAGGIE
watch powerless --

HAL
Hes going to run Gabe down --

TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

Ashen hyperventilating hes running on pure adrenalin and
fury as he drives the stick forward --
TRAVERS POV - GABE

is stiff-legging it toward the edge of the mountain -- but
hes too banged up to run fast through the thick snow --

THE HELICOPTER
with its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes --
GABE

as he throws himself flat into the snow -- the front of the
skid misses Gabe by inches as it blasts over him --

THE HELICOPTER

moves out over the precipice edge -- Travers banks it wide to
circle back around for another run --

GABE

gets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him --

IN A WOODED AREA

Hal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it
into one of the ammo clips -- Maggie stays back as he runs for

all hes worth out into the clearing --

THE HELICOPTER

has circled back around stopping at a hover far back in the
clearing -- Travers intends to not just run Gabe over but to
run him off the edge as well --

GABE

lumbers as fast as he can towards the edge --

TRAVERS

knows he has Gabe nailed -- he shoves the stick forward --
THE HELICOPTER

flies forward skids just inches over the snow --

HAL

runs out to where Travers is heading -- he lights the cloth
in the ammo clip -- as
THE HELICOPTER
flies past
IN THE CLEARING

Hal hurls the clip with its cloth fuse burning down into
the doorless side of the copter --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

-- the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit --
Travers sees it and looks down but --

THE FUSE

sputters out -- nothing but glowing embers in the cloth --
TRAVERS

smiles -- nothing to worry about -- he speeds ahead --

CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTERS SKIDS
as they slice through the top of the snow towards --
GABE

as he runs toward the mountains edge -- its just a couple of
feet ahead but the copter is a couple of feet behind --

-- as the copter overtakes Gabe dipping even lower into the
snow he dives off the edge --

FOLLOWING GABE - FALLING

Gabe is at the ladder -- he falls the first twenty feet of the
long drop then grabs a rung on the cable ladder very
painfully stopping his fall -- but in the same split second --

THE HELICOPTER

skid meant to impale Gabe catches the top two rungs of the
cable ladder --

WIDE SHOT - THE HELICOPTER

-- caught in the rungs of the cable ladder the helicopter
keeps flying out over the abyss but as it pulls the cable
ladder it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place
rung by rung -- -- still going full tilt the copter strains
against the ladder -- thirty feet of it tethers the copter
to the wall -- -- and Gabe is dangling from the center of
it

ON THE LADDER - GABE

has one arm hooked around a rung hanging on for his life as
the copter thrashes the ladder up and down --

INSIDE THE COPTER

Travers is disoriented by the jolt and tries to maintain
control -- he doesnt see --

-- that the cloth fuse on the ammo clip has reignited -- it
burns down to the clip and fifty rounds explode like a
string of firecrackers --

-- Travers tries to shield himself as he is struck by airborne
lead Shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel --

THE HELICOPTER

still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes
dead -- the rotor blades slow --

GABE ON LADDER

Gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor -- if it were
possible for him to grip the ladder tighter hed do it now --

ON THE HELICOPTER

-- as the rotor WHOPS to a dead halt the copter arcs down
and slams against the mountain wall -- the skids are still
caught in the ladder and it holds --

GABE

is shaken off by the massive impact -- he falls -- --
landing on the helicopter half in and half out of the
cockpit As Gabe scrambles for a solid hold --

INT HELICOPTER

-- Travers who has been shaken to the opposite side of the
copter reaches into his jacket and pulls out the pistol he
took from Frank -- he aims at Gabe --

INSERT - THE HELICOPTER SKID

One of the two rungs holding the copter up bursts --
THE HELICOPTER

slips now hanging from just a single rung -- -- and the
impact of the slip makes Travers drop the gun -- it falls out
the open passenger door Travers scrambles up through the
cabin to go after -- -- Gabe who is trying to get off the
helicopter and onto a solid part of the ladder before the
whole thing goes down -- Gabe jumps for the wall as

Travers scrambles behind him and --

CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER SKID

-- as the last rung supporting the copter snaps in two --
GABE

grabs hold of the ladder as

THE HELICOPTER

plummets down -- but as it starts its fall --

TRAVERS

leaps from the falling copter and grabs Gabes leg -- Gabe
struggles to support both of them but Travers weakened from
his wound loses his grip on Gabes leg -- he stares up in
terror at Gabe as he clutches Gabes snow-slick boot --

GABE
Cheer up Its a beautiful spot to
die

Travers slides off and away --
THE FALL - LONG SHOT

Travers SCREAMING as he free falls trailing behind the
helicopter -- we follow the entire four thousand foot drop --

-- until the helicopter explodes when it hits the ground far
below and the fireball engulfs Travers just before he
impacts into the explosion

GABE

looks down at the burning wreck and clings to the ladder
closing his eyes for a moment in exhaustion But the WHOPPING
of another helicopter makes him look up --

THE TREASURY HELICOPTER
has shown up a little too late to be of any help
INSIDE THE TREASURY COPTER

Wright Davis and Stuart look at the billowing flames of the
wreck -- even from here the burning money is visible
drifting up in the smoke Wright turns to Stuart

WRIGHT

Im no expert -- but what do you make

of that event
GABE
is drained -- from somewhere he finds the strength to lift
his head up --
GABES POV - THE WALL
The section of ladder above him of course is gone -- he has

to cover the fifty feet of wall above him by free climbing
There are holds that look easy enough for him but --

GABE

leans back gripping the ladder too tired to move Just the
thought of one more climb drains him

GABE
(mumbling)
Forget it No fucking way Im staying
right here Ive spent the night on
walls before -- some of the best
nights of my life have been spent
lashed to walls --

Before Gabe can take this any farther -- a loop tied to the
end of a rope falls to a stop next to him Gabe looks up --

ON THE EDGE - HAL
has thrown the line down Maggie is by his side
HAL
Remember -- keep your arms and legs in
the vehicle at all times --

GABE

puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote -- even
this action aches
GABE
(too tired to shout)
Fuck you --

Hal and Maggie draw Gabe up -- Gabe pulls some of his weight
by using hand and foot holds but when he reaches

THE PRECIPICE EDGE

Hal and Maggie are both winded from the effort as they haul
Gabe onto the top Gabe unties himself and collapses into
Maggies lap

HAL
(winded coiling the
rope)
Jesus Christ -- you think you could

have put a little less effort into
that climb I mean what have you done
for me -- lately

Hal ends his harrangue and looks over -- Gabe has apparently
revived because he and Maggie are locked in the kiss of their
lives Hal stands and smiles -- he walks toward the Treasury
agents who are scrambling out of the helicopter Hal starts
an explanation thats going to take a long long time as --
GABE AND MAGGIE

break off their kiss

MAGGIE
Does this mean youre staying

Off Gabes answering smile we --

FADE OUT
