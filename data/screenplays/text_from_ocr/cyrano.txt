Lyrics by

INT ROXANNE’S HOME CITY - DUSK
Roughly 1640 but as timeless as it is period

ROXANNEs home is small only essential pieces of furniture -
tasteful but poor A shelf of books in pride of place In
contrast her wardrobe overflows with elegant dresses She
stands looking at them Her chaperone MARIE at her side

ROXANNE
I’m hungry

MARIE
A lady never complains

Roxanne throws aside an extravagant red dress

ROXANNE
We can’t eat dresses If only the Duke had
sent bread

MARIE
I think he wants to marry you

ROXANNE
Id rather marry you

Marie snorts in amusement despite herself

MARIE
He’s a Duke and you my dear a rapidly
ageing orphan

ROXANNE
I won’t be rescued I’m not in distress

MARIE
We have no money Not a bean Your whole
life our country has been at war and-

MARIE (CONTD) ROXANNE
Everyone must make (lovingly imitating)
compromises in a war- “everyone must make

compromises in a war”

ROXANNE (CONTD)
I don’t love The Duke de Guiche

Roxanne picks out a sage green dress

MARIE
Wear the dress he sent

ROXANNE
No Red is vulgar and reeks of lechery

Marie reluctantly helps her put the sage dress on
Revision 2

MARIE
If you don’t love him -

ROXANNE
Or even like him -

MARIE
- Then why did you accept his invitation
to the theatre

ROXANNE
Because we can’t afford the tickets and I
want to see the play

EXT ROXANNES HOUSE CONT

De Guiche’s ornate carriage pulls up ouside Roxanne’s home

INT ROXANNES ROOM CONT

MARIE
(at window)
He’s here Now don’t be rude to him

ROXANNE
I’m not I’m enigmatically distant
andfashionably late - where are my
shoes

MARIE
(big warning)
If you anger him he’1l ruin us

ROXANNE
Where are they

Marie helps Roxanne look for the shoes
MARIE
Marry the Duke and you’1l be rich I
promised your father I’d keep you safe

ROXANNE
No one’s safe in a cage

MARIE
A clever marriage is your only option

ROXANNE
I have no intention to marry anyone

MARIE
Believe me spinsterhood is bleak
Revision 3

Marie hands Roxanne her shoes Roxanne tries but can’t reach
her feet in the dress

ROXANNE
And love Does that count for nothing with
you

Marie puts Roxanne’s shoes on her

MARIE
It might smell rosy for a year or two but
love doesn’t last What lasts is
compromise and sacrifice Children need
love Adults need money

Marie rushes down the stairs to meet De Guiche The surly but
quite handsome LANDLORD hovers

LANDLORD
(to Marie)
Tell your mistress she’s two months behind
with the rent

MARIE
(hurrying past)
It’s coming I promise

INT INSIDE CARRIAGE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH CITY CONT

Roxanne and Marie sat opposite DE GUICHE and VALVERT (a Comte
in service to De Guiche dressed in ribbons and bows)

De Guiche in elaborate finery looks Roxanne up and down for
a while It’s disturbing

DE GUICHE
(nods at her dress)
It’s perfectly fetching But I longed to
see you in crimson silk

ROXANNE

Mmm I couldn’t wear that dress
DE GUICHE

No
ROXANNE

I don’t have the shoes to match Sorry

DE GUICHE
I will rectify your errant shoelessness

Valvert snorts Roxanne looks at him
Revision 4

ROXANNE
Perhaps the good Duke should have sent the
dress to you Valvert

VALVERT
Oh I tried it Too loose on the bust

De Guiche and Valvert snigger Roxanne forces a smile back
Marie looks anxiously between them

As the carriage takes them to the theater De Guiche and
Valvert talk and Marie makes polite small talk Roxanne looks
out the window We don’t hear them as she sings

Song SOMEONE TO SAY

ROXANNE
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO SLOW DANCE IN
SUNLIGHT WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE
SOMEBODY WHO SEES YOU AND WON’T EVER LEAVE
YOU ALONE WHATEVER COMES

The carriage drives along the narrow streets of the city it
passes couples in love As Roxanne sees them they dance

ROXANNE (CONTD)
I NEED SOMETHING TO DIE FOR
WRITE POEMS AND CRY FOR
AND I WONT BE ASHAMED
IM NOBODYS PET NO ONES WIFE NO ONES
WOMAN AND I WONT PLAY THAT GAME
ID GIVE ANYTHING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY
THAT THEY CANT LIVE WITHOUT ME AND
THEYLL BE THERE FOREVER
ID GIVE ANYTHING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY TO ME
THAT NO MATTER HOW BAD IT GETS THEY WON’T
TURN AWAY FROM ME

5 EXT A STREET CONT
Roxanne continues to sing

ROXANNE (0S)
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU’RE ALWAYS WAITING
TO FIND LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IF I’M NAIVE WHY DOES ALL THE POETRY SAY
THAT I MIGHT
I HAVE HEARD SONGS THAT SAY LOVE CONQUERS
EVERYTHING HOWEVER YOU NAME IT
IT’S RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU WHEREVER
YOU ARE YOU JUST HAVE TO CLAIM IT

CHRISTIAN has just arrived in the city (A poor country boy
and handsome) He carries a single bag with all he owns in the
world
Revision 5

He peers into the window of a bakery RAGUENEAUS is written
on the glass He counts his change to see if he can afford
something to eat

De Guiche’s carriage drives past Christian sees Roxanne’s
reflection in the window Roxanne does not see Christian

Christian turns and stares at Roxanne as she passes He must
see her again He chases after the carriage
EXT OUTSIDE THE THEATER CONT

A grand old theater THEATREGOERS gathered on the street A
sign says the HOUSE IS FULL

Marquis Comtes Vicomtes and Barons in wigs and fine clothes
walk in the door past the guards who nod to them

Poor folk plainly dressed wait behind a rope to get in

De Guiche helps Roxanne down from his carriage and offers her
his arm

Christian arrives behind the carriage and sees Roxanne exit
it He grabs the arm of a poor stranger

CHRISTIAN
(pointing to Roxanne)
Who’s that

STRANGER
The Duke De Guiche Second only to the
King

CHRISTIAN
No The lady

STRANGER

Oh Roxanne

Suddenly LE BRET (The Captain of the Guards in uniform) grabs
the stranger’s arm

LE BRET
Have you seen Cyrano

STRANGER
Not yet

Christian sees Le Bret’s rank and uniform and salutes

CHRISTIAN
Christian Neuvillette I’m a new recruit
I’m enlisting in the King’s Guard
tomorrow
Revision 6

Le Bret smiles in friendly warning

LE BRET
Well good luck with that At ease

Le Bret heads into the theater to look for Cyrano

As they climb the steps De Guiche and Roxanne pass by two
women in dresses overdone with dripping lace They wave at De
Guiche giggle swoon whisper behind fans obviously flirting
with him Roxanne sees the exchange and shoots Marie an ‘I
told you so’ look

LADY 1
What superb ribbons Duke De Guiche

LADY 2
(playing the
innuendo)
Gorgeous piping and trim

DE GUICHE
Doeskin and beaver ladies doeskin and
beaver

POV of Christian as he watches Roxanne and De Guiche go
into the theater (the guard bows and holds back the crowd as
they pass) followed by Valvert and Marie

Christian makes a quick decision He finds a lurking ‘SCALPER’
and after some intense negotiation manages to buy a ticket
with the last money he has

We follow Christian inside the theater

INT THEATER CONT

We see all the levels of society in the descending tiered
boxes and the poor on the floor standing The floor is a
dangerous place - jostling and cramped

Christian moves through the crowd He passes a THIEF (holding
a knife) with a group of five rough looking YOUNG MEN gathered
close he whispers intently

THIEF
Be swift be crafty take from the women
and the men without swords

THIEF 2

And children

THIEF
A child with a full purse is an adult

The thieves nod and set to work
Revision 7

ROXANNE
I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY
THAT THEY CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT ME AND
THEY’LL BE THERE FOREVER I’D GIVE ANYTHING
FOR SOMEONE TO SAY TO ME
THAT NO MATTER HOW BAD IT GETS THEY WON’T
TURN AWAY FROM ME

Christian is looking all around for Roxanne De Guiche
Valvert Roxanne and Marie take their seats in a premium box
on stage Finally Christian sees her

ROXANNE (CONTD)
IF LOVES THERE I FEEL IT AND ITS STARE
IT WOULD BE A FREEDOM AT FIRST SIGHT
ILL BE WALKING ON AIR
IF LOVES THERE WONT DARE RUN AWAY
ILL SWALLOW MY PRIDE AND ILL ASK YOU TO
STAY

Roxanne sees Christian for the first time Their eyes lock as
she sings the last lines they both fall instantly and
irrevocably in love at first sight

Roxanne gasps and points behind Christian as a thief grabs his
bag and runs off through the crowd Christian turns and gives
chase The spell is broken The song is over

Christian rushes past a THEATRE BUFF and his young SON in the
crowd

THEATRE BUFF

Ahhh Theatre Inhale it my boy

(Boy looks confused)
Literally

(Boy gingerly

breathes in)
Feel it Yes Tonight you will see the
magnificent Montfleury The greatest actor
of his generation

The boy smiles up at his father as the audience chants and
bangs on the boxes ‘Play Play Play’ Its like a modern
day boxing match or live music event - alive with eager fans

The concessions girl offers oranges Roxanne takes one and
then another And then two more She passes one to the
grateful Marie De Guiche pays

As the lights dim Roxanne starts tearing into her oranges
The curtain parts The corpulent MONTFLEURY enters he is
dressed as a shepherd boy with a bonnet covered in roses and
carrying a large crook The audience applauds warmly

The son of the Theatre Buff looks confused ‘him
Revision 8

Montfleury finds Roxanne in the box He smiles at her
Then girls dressed as sheep enter and dance

MONTFLEURY
(huge voice)
“Happy is he who far from Court and
Societies sway in isolation self imposed
shuns company And who when the soft wind
whistles wishingly upon he-

Suddenly - from the back of the house

CYRANO’S VOICE
Montfleury What are you doing here

Two of the sheep on stage freeze and look at each other

SHEEP GIRL
Cyrano

The second sheep nods emphatically

CYRANO’S VOICE
After your performance last week I sent
you a letter urging you to retire

Roxanne recognizes the voice and searches the crowd At the
same time Le Bret (close to the stage) turns with a gasp under
his breath

LE BRET ROXANNE
Cyrano Cyrano

Montfleury looks defiant The audience in the boxes look
around The groundlings whisper excitedly They think
Montfleury is alright but they love Cyrano

MONTFLEURY
“Happy is he who far from court and
Societies -

CYRANO’S VOICE
(louder )
Did you receive my letter

MONTFLEURY
Sway in isolation self imposed -

CYRANO’S VOICE
Well

Montfleury suddenly breaks character and shouts
MONTFLEURY

Yes I received your letter and I burnt it
I am a professional actor
Revision 9

MONTFLEURY (CONTD)
I’ve received numerous prizes I have
performed at court for the King himself I
have been successfully entertaining the
people for over three decades And now I
will AcT

All the ARISTOCRATS give him loud applause and cheers
(including De Guiche and Valvert)

ARISTOCRATS
Act Act Act

Montfleury thanks them for their support and prepares to
continue As he draws breath

CYRANO’S VOICE
Youve been brutalizing the people for
thirty years You’ve bludgeoned them into
believing that your trumpeting noise and
preposterous gestures are art

The GROUNDLINGS cheer and Roxanne claps her hands in delight
De Guiche glances at her with displeasure

BOY
(to Theatre Buff)
Is this part of the play

THEATRE BUFF
Most certainly not It’s an outrage
(shouts out)
Montfleury is a God

The boy cringes Aristocrats applaud Montfleury acknowledges
the compliment and draws breath

CYRANO’S VOICE
(to Montfleury)
In the name of all that is holy desist

MONTFLEURY
(to Cyrano)
You have no authority here

The rich stand - looking for who is speaking - they are
excited and scandalized

VALVERT
Bellow Montfleury act like thunder

CYRANO’S VOICE
(to Valvert)
I suggest you keep quiet or I will trim
your ribbons and bows-

The crowd standing on the floor cheer this idea
Revision 10

ALL THE MARQUIS
Do your acting Montfleury

CYRANO’S VOICE
He’d better not-

MONTFLEURY
“Happy he who shuns”

CYRANO’S VOICE
Final warning

MONTFLEURY
(to Cyrano
furiously)
In insulting me you insult The Dramatic
Muse and worse you desecrate this
theater this crucible of
humanhumanity This sacred Wooden 0

THEATRE BUFF nods in passionate agreement his son stifles his

laughter

We finally see Cyrano for the first time Hes up in
He hooks his sword hilt over a rope and drops to the
floor where the groundlings part for him

CYRANO

No Sir Untrue I’m sorry but you lie
Youve made this stage your personal sty
The Dramatic Muse has fled the building
She scarpered when you started
gilding the lily with your

(imitates booming)
‘Great Big Voice’
The poor Muse had no choice
I love this place and all it means
Poetry Romance Terror Truth
I’ve loved it here since early youth
I can’t stand aside while you dishonour it
with your pumping and hideous jigs
I will not abide your thumping and
dreadful wigs
(sheep look nervous)
Montfleury you’ve abandoned the truth
youve lost your core
You can’t remember how truth feels and
what it’s for
So now please leave this stage never to
return
And I will applaud the new integrity
youll earn
EXIT MONTFLEURY

the Gods
orchestra

Pandemonium While the Groundlings cheer Roxanne applauds
beaming at Cyrano He coolly nods to her Le Bret notices this

moment
Revision 11

MONTFLEURY
I am not moving one step from the centre
of this stage I am necessary I ama
teller of truths profound comical
tragical mystical whatever you bloody
wantical

The Aristocrats cheer

CYRANO
If you won’t leave by invitation then I’m
compelled to use force

Cyrano vaults over the stalls gate and charges through the
crowd who part to let him pass Theyre going wild

MONTFLEURY
Help me someone Protect me Arrest him
Help please-

The theater manager (JODELET) emerges from backstage

JODELET
Please Cyrano -

Cyrano leaps onto the stage and turns to the crowd

CYRANO

Will anyone here defend this great
sausage I will duel with any volunteer
with all the honour commensurate to his
station Is anyone willing to fight for
Montfleury

Laughter and derision from the boxes and cheers and shouts
from the groundlings

MARQUIS
You are no Samson

CYRANO
Im no Goliath either But I fight like
the two combined

MARQUIS
I think not Goliath was a GIANT

Cyrano draws his sword Boxes gasp Groundlings cheer

CYRANO
(to Marquis)
Care to think again

The Marquis shakes his head and hides behind his lady
companion The crowd laugh But not de Guiche and Valvert who
look on in fury from their box
Revision 12

CYRANO (CONTD)

No volunteers You came here to see him
but you won’t fight for him Montfleury
Exit Or face this sword

Cyrano strolls back to the stage

MONTFLEURY
Sir please

CYRANO
On a count of three you will Exit Stage
Right - hurriedly

MONTFLEURY
Please

CYRANO
One

MONTFLEURY

(to Jodelet)

Do something

CYRANO
Two

JODELET
Cyrano please sir for the sake of the
play

CYRANO
Three

Montfleury runs off Cyrano looks at Roxanne and bows to her
She smiles at him warmly De Guiche sees the exchange and
doesn’t like it

Members of the audience stand The boxes boo The floor
applauds Cyrano ladies whisper from behind fans

JODELET
Ladies Gentlemen Please

A MARQUIS
I came to see a play

CYRANO
So did I But that man explodes them Fire
him from a cannon and we’d win the war
People laugh and pound the boxes

THEATRE BUFF
We have paid to see a play
Revision 13

CYRANO
And I have saved you from seeing a fiasco

THEATRE BUFF
We paid to see Montfleury

JODELET
(to Cyrano urgently)
Yes what about their money

CYRANO
(sighs )
Always the money

Cyrano tosses Jodelet a bag of coins

JODELET

(Opens bagto Cyrano)
At this price sir you can close the
theater every night

(to Audience)
Ladies and gentlemen you will be refunded
in full at the door

(general cheering)
Clear the house Clear the house

The chandeliers descend The lobby doors open The audience
begins to leave De Guiche pulls Valvert aside

DE GUICHE
He may be silver-tongued but his
sensibility is base

VALVERT

He should learn some manners
DE GUICHE

So teach him
VALVERT

--Now

De Guiche nods ominously

VALVERT (CONTD)
Despite his vulgarity he’s known as an
accomplished swordsman

DE GUICHE
All the more pleasure for you He denied
us our entertainment now make us laugh
Valvert bring us joy Torture the little
beast

De Guiche smiles Then begins to exit from the box with
Roxanne and Marie while Valvert descends to the floor
Revision 14

Le Bret touches Cyrano who grins as they embrace

CYRANO
Le Bret

LE BRET
Dinner

CYRANO
Love to But No money

LE BRET
You had a full bag of coins

CYRANO
All donated to the long-suffering patrons
of this theater

LE BRET
But how will you eat

CYRANO
The gesture was more important

They turn to go but Valvert steps in front of Cyrano

VALVERT
You

CYRANO
Me Sir

VALVERT

Youre a freak
Roxanne gasps The audience stops exiting and turns

VALVERT (CONTD)
Nothing to say freak

CYRANO
The insult is antique but I accept it

VALVERT
Ha Freak

The audience slowly form a circle around Cyrano and Valvert
who stare at each other Ten yards apart

CYRANO
Have you exhausted your dictionary of
scorn Is that it

The crowd laughs and claps
Revision 15

VALVERT
Who is this savage who dares to present
himself in public without ribbons bows or
braids

CYRANO
I’m not au courant it’s true But think
of my deeds as ribbons my humour as a
bow my -

VALVERT
Oh do pipe down or else youll drown -
in verbosity

CYRANO
A fellow poet Pleasure to meet you
Cyrano De Bergerac

De Guiche nods at Valvert - ‘Do it’ Valvert throws his glove
in Cyrano’s face Audience gasp

CYRANO (CONTD)
I accept your challenge

Tension Valvert draws his sword Cyrano draws Roxanne
watches intently

VALVERT
(to crowd)
I’1l make short work of this

CYRANO
(to crowd)
Isn’t he a hoot

Valvert lunges but Cyrano brilliantly evades him

CYRANO (CONTD)
A palpable miss

This lunge and evade continues a while Valvert is losing
face Now he plays to the crowd for sympathy

VALVERT
It’s hard to hit a target quite so small
The man is barely four feet tall

Sudden silence Those who know him know Cyrano wont like
this Cyrano stares at Valvert Then catches Roxanne’s eye
She gives him a worried sympathetic smile A tension Will he
slice Valvert to ribbons of flesh Some of the crowd step back
in anticipation of blood But Cyrano has other ideas

CYRANO
He calls me ‘freak’ ‘short’ ‘small’
It’s soon the nose
Our language is rich
Revision 16

CYRANO (CONTD)
a jewel box a ruby
But this perfumed booby
uses words ‘small’
like some old marquis
Takes a fall

Cyrano collapses feebly The crowd laugh Cyrano groans on
the floor and then springs up bursting with life

CYRANO (CONTD)

(to Valvert)
Where’s the muscle where’s the sinew
Or should I take it that these words
aren’t in you
God gave us all a heart and brain
opened up we’d seem the same
But when He made our outward frame
Such infinite variety
brought mostly pain

(sarcastically)
Thank you Lord

Le Bret cheers Cyrano takes in Roxanne a moment

CYRANO (CONTD)
Some got figures tall and fine
but God made othersaquiline

Valvert makes to lunge at Cyrano but De Guiche (enjoying it)
prevents him

CYRANO (CONTD)
Some were blessed with a face that could
launch a thousand ships
(to Valvert)
Others got a mug to sink them

Cyrano hunches over in curved fashion
SONG When I Was Born

CYRANO (CONTD)
SIR WHEN I WAS BORN THE NURSES LAUGHED
HYSTERICALLY
THEY’D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE ME
APPARENTLY
ILL NEVER FORGET IT I CAN STILL HEAR
THEM JOKING
ONE SAID “MY GOODNESS WHAT HAS GOD BEEN
SMOKING
AND WHEN THEY HANDED ME OVER TO MY MOTHER
SHE HANDED ME BACK AND SAID
“ARE YOU SURE THERE ISNT ANY OTHER”

Cyrano goes after him - his skill is dazzling Cyrano keeps
besting Valvert as he sings
Rev 102320 (Blue)

CYRANO (CONTD)

FROM WHEN I WAS BORN I LEARNED TO CONTROL
MY TEARS WHEN THEY CARRIED ME HOME
THROUGH TOWN I LEFT A TRAIL OF BROKEN
MIRRORS

YES WHEN CHILDREN SEE ME THEY SCREAM AND
RUN AWAY YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
HALLOWEEN’S MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY

As Cyrano sings each rhyme he makes a sword strike
precisely removes Valvert’s ribbons bows and wig

CYRANO (CONTD)

I AM A MONSTER I AM A MUTANT A FREAK OF
NATURE IVE HEARD ALL THE UGLY HATEFUL
NOMENCLATURE

I TOLD A GIRL ONCE I LOVED HER CRICKETS
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID “I SUPPOSE I
COULD SELL TICKETS

AT SCHOOL THE ONLY THING I LEARNT IS FOLKS
ARE PLENTY CRUEL

THEY MADE ME PAINT MY FACE WITH WHITE AND
PLAY THE TEACHERS FOOL

CANT YOU SEE IM MORE THAN YOU THINK
IVE HEARD IT ALL SO MANY TIMES

EVERYBODY KNOWS IM SO MUCH MORE THAN A
FREAK

IF YOU WANNA TRY TO HURT ME YOU BETTER
GET IN LINE

YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY IT I GET IT IT
MAKES SENSE

WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR KIND OF TALENT FOR
CLEVER VICIOUS COMMENTS

MY HEART’S NOT EVEN ANGRY IT’S JUST THE
WAY IT BREAKS AND DON’T BE SO TOUGH ON
GOD EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES

YES ONE SIGHT OF ME COULD MAKE A STATUE
CRY

GUESS WHAT ELSE WHEN BLUEBIRDS LAND ON ME
THEY SHIT THEMSELVES AND DIE

WHICHEVER WAY I LOOK AT YOU CANT FIND A
TASTEFUL SIDE A SPECIMEN LIKE YOU BELONGS
IN FORMALDEHYDE

YES WHAT YOUVE HEARD IS TRUE I AM NOTA
RUMOR I’M LIVING PROOF THAT GOD HAS A
SICK SENSE OF HUMOR

CANT YOU SEE IM MORE THAN YOU THINK
IVE HEARD IT ALL SO MANY TIMES

EVERYBODY KNOWS IM SO MUCH MORE THAN A
FREAK

IF YOU WANNA TRY TO HURT ME YOUD BETTER
GET IN LINE

that

Song over - Cyrano advances on Valvert forcing him backwards
Revision 18

CYRANO (CONTD)
(coldly)
Take this and this and that

He pins Valvert at the neck with the point of his sword and
holds him there

CYRANO (CONTD)
I’1l have you horizontal
Unspeakable speechless rat

He forces Valvert to his knees and finally to the floor
Victory Applause Le Bret whistles Roxanne exhales with
relief De Guiche shakes his head

Cyrano turns and walks away The crowd chant his name

CROWD
Cyrano Cyrano Cyrano

Cyrano bows to them with graceful humility But Valvert
suddenly springs up and lunges at Cyrano’s back -

ROXANNE
(warning him)
Cyrano

Her oranges fall to the floor Cyrano turns and draws Valvert
runs onto his sword It plunges deep into his guts and
through Terrified screams from the crowd

Cyrano looks at the shocked Valvert with pity - they stand
locked together by the sword - almost in embrace - Cyrano
whispers intimately to Valvert no one else hears this

CYRANO
Yes It all goes in
My God how it hurts

Cyrano swiftly withdraws his sword and Valvert collapses
mortally wounded Several Comtes rush to Valvert and crowd
around him Le Bret pulls Cyrano away Cyrano looks back

LE BRET
Quickly -

CYRANO
The poor dead fool

LE BRET
You had no choice -

They join the crowd exiting the theater as-

Revision 19

INT DE GUICHE’S CARRIAGE MOMENTS LATER
De Guiche is raging

DE GUICHE
He went too far

ROXANNE
Valvert insulted him and then challenged
him to a duel

DE GUICHE
Valvert’s a Comte - or was - in my
retinue
ROXANNE
I assure you Cyrano took no pleasure from
it
De Guiche thinks
DE GUICHE
You know him
Roxanne pauses a moment
MARIE
They’re from the same town in the South
West
ROXANNE
Cyrano is my oldest friend
DE GUICHE
It would be to your advantage to end the

friendship
Marie gives Roxanne a sharp look ‘don’t contest this’

DE GUICHE (CONTD)
I won’t wait forever

ROXANNE
(nervous smile)
Did I miss a proposal

De Guiche leans in to her Holds her chin firmly

DE GUICHE
Don’t push it pretty thing

He releases her Roxanne looks away out the window
Rev 102320 (Blue) 20

EXT A DIFFERENT STREET LATER SAME NIGHT

Le Bret and Cyrano heading home after dinner The eating house
behind them Both men are a little drunk and merry

CYRANO
How about a drinking song Like soldiers
do

LE BRET

Were better than that At least I am
Cyrano chuckles

LE BRET (CONTD)
May I ask a question

CYRANO
Anything

LE BRET
(muses )
It’s a little personal

CYRANO
I have no secrets from you

LE BRET
Are you in love

Cyrano stops dead completely thrown

CYRANO
Whatever gives you that idea

LE BRET
I knew you wouldn’t like it

CYRANO
Do I seem offended

LE BRET
No But your guard is up

CYRANO
It’s justsome things are private

LE BRET
What gave me ‘the idea’ was your
performance at the theatre today I sensed
you were playing to one particular member
of the audience

CYRANO
Oh who

Le Bret stares at him
Rev 102320 (Blue)

LE BRET
Let’s not continue this charade If you
want to unburden fine If you don’t then
that’s fine too

Cyrano stares back A long time Then smiles softly

CYRANO
Yes Yes I am in love I dare My sole
purpose on this earth is to love Roxanne
(slight pause)
Feel better now

LE BRET
Do you

Song MADLY

CYRANO
HAVE YOU EVER WANTED SOMETHING
SO BADLY YOU CANNOT BREATHE
HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEONE MADLY

LE BRET
I don’t think I have

CYRANO
Isn’t shemagnificent

LE BRET
(playfully)
Yes she is though perhaps a little vain

CYRANO
Yes but magnificently so

LE BRET
There’s some pretension in there too

CYRANO
She’s full of it

LE BRET
I wasn’t sure about her hair today

CYRANO
Agreed But even her imperfections are
perfect In our little town back in the
day she was practically worshipped To
some she was notorious to me glorious

LE BRET
Does she know
Rev 102320 (Blue)

CYRANO
You think a person with her beauty - in
mind body and soul - doesn’t know about
it

LE BRET
I meant does she know you’re in love with
her

CYRANO
No It would mortify her Someone like me
supposing to love perfection She’d be
offended No if I ever confessed she’d
never see me again

LE BRET
You don’t have a very high opinion of her

CYRANO
What She’s The Alps

LE BRET
But you don’t trust she has the depth to
look beyond your -

CYRANO
Careful

LE BRET
Your unique physique

CYRANO
Not bad

LE BRET

To love you for who you are not for how
you look

CYRANO
Yes yes yes but don’t you see I’m
simply not worthy of her

Song resumes

CYRANO (CONTD)
IVE HELD MY BREATH SINCE I SAW HER
IVE TRIED TO LOOK AWAY BUT I CANT RESIST
I KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF HER I MADE A LIST
I CAN’T TELL YOU HOW LONG I’VE THOUGHT
ABOUT HER I’VE KEPT EVERYTHING SHE’S
MISSED SHE’S GONNA LAUGH AT THE ONE THAT
BRINGS HER LOVE LIKE THIS
HAVE YOU EVER WANTED SOMETHING
SO BADLY YOU CANNOT BREATHE
HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEONE MADLY

Rev 102320 (Blue) 23

LE BRET
When you were fighting Valvert she was
anxious

Le Bret imitates Roxanne watching Cyrano at the theater

LE BRET (CONTD)
She turned quite pale her lips trembled
and parted and she touched her heart -

Le Bret touches his heart and fans himself

LE BRET (CONTD)
You should tell her You love her

CYRANO
Never My fate is to love her from afar
To confess would be to shatter the
beautiful dream

Cyrano smiles reluctant and rueful

LE BRET
You forget I’ve seen you in battle
Youre a fighter to the end But in love
youve raised the white flag Have faith
in her Tell her the truth

Marie is bustling down the street towards them at speed She
checks no one’s watching then

MARIE
(to Cyrano)
A word Roxanne wishes to meet with you
alone

CYRANO
(instantly
exhilarated)
What Why

MARIE
She won’t say no matter how much I berate
her But she says it’s urgent

CYRANO

MARIE
Not now you vulgar person At night

CYRANO
Then when
Revision 24

MARIE
She’1ll go to early Mass tomorrow After
she leaves the church she’1ll meet with
you Somewhere discreet she said it must
be private

Le Bret looks at Cyrano significantly then raises an eyebrow

MARIE (CONTD)
(to Le Bret)
I’1l thank you Captain Le Bret to lower
that eyebrow There is nothing unseemly
here

LE BRET
I bow to your expertise on the matter

Marie bristles unsure whether she’s been insulted or
complimented

MARIE
(to Cyrano sharply)
A venue please

In his excitement Cyrano can’t think
MARIE (CONTD)

I’ve never seen him silent before it’s
quite appealing

CYRANO
Let me think

MARIE
Where

CYRANO

I’m thinking where
(to Le Bret)

Where
LE BRET
Ragueneau’s There’s a room upstairs
MARIE
7 oclock She’1ll be there
CYRANO
I will too
MARIE

And so will I Goodnight

Marie hurries back the way she came
Revision 25

CYRANO
(beaming)
She wants to see me Privately

LE BRET
There it is

CYRANO
Alone (Except for the crone)

Cyrano is running Le Bret laughs trying to keep up

CYRANO (CONTD)
I must not succumb to hope Hope is
madness Hope is hell

LE BRET
Hope is life

CYRANO
I need an army to vanquish I have ten
hearts and twenty arms I could kill a
hundred men

Le Bret laughs and stops walking

LE BRET
Good night my friend And good luck
tomorrow
CYRANO
(hopefully)
This could be it
LE BRET
Have faith
Le Bret turns to leave
CYRANO

Where are you off to at this late hour

LE BRET
Some things are private

Le Bret heads towards a dark alley
CYRANO
(suddenly remembers )
Thank you for dinner

Le Bret waves without turning Cyrano dances away in the
direction

Revision 26

EXT STAIRS SAME NIGHT 10

Cyrano walks past a wealthy carriage and horses stopped in the
street The figure inside is in shadow

Suddenly Cyrano is jumped by ten men They come at him all at
once forming a large circle He draws his sword

CYRANO
I had hoped to fight one hundred But ten
will do

Cyrano runs a man through with his sword He knocks another
one into the water and then jumps in after him The water is
ankle deep and shining in the moonlight Cyrano holds the man
down with his foot while he fights off another with his sword
He lets go of the man in the water who is now dead and runs
the other through and takes his sword He jumps out of the
water and duels with two at once a sword in either hand at
the water’s edge He defeats both He is attacked from behind
and as he turns he is cut on his hand He keeps swashbuckling
until the remaining two attackers flee

Cyrano clenches his hand to stop bleeding The carriage drives
off quickly We see De Guiche in the back Cyrano watches the
carriage pass Then continues his walk home

INT CYRANOS ROOM THE GARRISON - FOLLOWING MORNING 5AM 11
Cyrano’s room is spacious minimal and very neat A single bed
(made with military corners) along a wall A large desk neatly
piled with books and stacks of loose paper (his poetry and
writing) A straight line of ink pens on the desk There is a
single high window and a small wash basin

Cyrano is up early He’s writing a letter and taking great
care over it

The wound on his hand is now bandaged

Close in on Cyrano as he writes Nearly finished he smudges a
word He curses puts the letter to one side and starts again
EXT STREET - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 12
Cyrano walks quickly He’s tense with nervous energy He stops
a moment in the empty street Catches his breath Breathes in
deeply steadying himself

INT RAGUENEAU’S SHOP - LATER SAME MORNING 13

A bakery and food store Copper pots bowls wooden tables
Low ceilings brick archways wood beams
Revision 27

Smoked glass windows on the street front RAGUENEAUS in gilt
letters (This is the same shop Christian first looked in)

RAGUENEAU is seated hard at work writing

CYRANO
Morning Ragueneau

RAGUENEAU
Cyrano Just the man

CYRANO
What time is it

RAGUENEAU
Almost six I’m up with the muse as it
were A poem Needs your expert ear-

CYRANO
I’m told you have a private room
(Ragueneau nods
slightly
suggestively)
I mean a room where two people can have
some privacy

RAGUENEAU
Bit early for an assignation

CYRANO
I mean talk privately without
interruption

Ragueneau grabs his poem from the table -

RAGUENEAU
I’1l show you Simultaneously I’1l recite
what I have so far The poem is entitled
‘Constellation’
(seeking approval)
Eh

CYRANO
Terrific

They walk through the bakery
RAGUENEAU
“My love is akin to the Sun
‘Tis a vast ball of fire”

Now through the kitchen They pass a line of bakers up to
their elbows in flour and dough

A BAKER
I saw your duel last night

Revision 28
CYRANO
Which one
The baker turns to the man next to him

A BAKER
Which one What panache

Cyrano and Ragueneau continue walking-

RAGUENEAU
“And you my love are Venus
My heavenly earthly desire”

Ragueneau shows Cyrano a large room full of tables and chairs
waiters set them out

RAGUENEAU (CONTD)
(proudly)
‘Heavenly earthly’ eh

CYRANO
Something more private

RAGUENEAU
I understand Discretion

Ragueneau leads Cyrano up a steep narrow stair
RAGUENEAU (CONTD)

“Jupiter and Pluto are planets
Revolving - like us - far apart”

INT ATTIC OF THE BAKERY - MOMENTS LATER

A window looks out on a back garden of roses Two chairs a
basin of water A mirror Paper and pencils on a table

CYRANO
Good

RAGUENEAU
“But oh may these words bring you closer
May I woo you with this Art”
(pause)
That’s it Thus far

Cyrano is looking out the window deep in thought
RAGUENEAU (CONTD)
There’s a long way to go but - be brutal -
do you think the planetary metaphor holds

CYRANO
It holds firmly

Revision 29

RAGUENEAU
It’s not too obvious I can take it
CYRANO
Perhaps consider sublimation
RAGUENEAU
-Right
CYRANO

Try a different pattern of imagery Maybe
something you know intimately

RAGUENEAU
Hmm Anything in mind

CYRANO
Baking

RAGUENEAU

Sensuality and longing expressed through
the act of baking

CYRANO
Why not

RAGUENEAU
Rising dough Flour Ovens Heat My God -
thank you - thank you

Ragueneau leaves Cyrano in a dash to rework the poem

Cyrano stands alone in the room He drinks water from the
basin with his hands He is surprised by his reflection in
the mirror He looks at himself At first he feels ok even
confident and then crushing doubt consumes him He turns the
mirror so his reflection is hidden

Now he takes his letter from his pocket and re-reads it
Curses Something’s wrong He folds it away and sits at the
desk to rewrite it

CYRANO (VO)
Dear Roxanne

As Cyrano writes he sings
Song YOUR NAME
CYRANO (CONTD)
EVERY MORNING AT THE BREAK OF LIGHT I SEE
YOU STANDING IN THE SUN

As Cyrano sings we see three different worlds (Cyrano
Roxanne and the Bakers) with continuous action

Cyrano writing looking out the window at the roses singing

INT ROXANNES ROOM CONT 14B

Roxanne dressing in a bright sunlit room She is briefly
critical of her face in the mirror She is dressing quickly
for church

EXT CHURCH CONT 14C

A beautiful cathedral We should feel Roxanne is small
against the great hand of God Roxanne and Marie kneel in
prayer deep in thought

INT BAKERY CONT 14D

The flour ballet The bakers baking and dancing a sensual
expression of Cyrano’s desire

The flour ballet is a dance that begins in reality measuring
and using flour to bake and grows to a spectacular sexual
dance where flour is tossed hangs in the air and covers the
dancers

CYRANO
YOU LOOK AT ME WITH THE KINDEST EYES
EVERY MORNING I’M OVERCOME
INFATUATION AND DESPERATE DESIRE MADNESS
ENCHANTMENT AND SHAME
SORROW AND GLORY AND BLINDING EUPHORIA
EVERYTHING’S THERE IN YOUR NAME
IN DARKNESS WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES I SEE
YOUR HAIR COME UNDONE
I LOSE MYSELF EVERY TIME
EVEN NOW I’M OVERCOME
YOUR SMILE YOUR FLESH THE BRUSH OF YOUR
BREATH HUMILIATION AND PAIN
MY HUNGER MY PATIENCE MY DEVASTATION
EVERYTHING’S THERE IN YOUR NAME

Roxanne now masked - only her eyes are revealed - and Marie
arrive at the bakery and are escorted through and up the
stairs by Ragueneau

CYRANO (CONTD)
ROXANNE WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY
WORDS ARE ONLY GLASS ON A STRING
THE MORE I ARRANGE THEM AND LINE UP AND
CHANGE THEM
THE MORE THEY MEAN THE SAME THING
ROXANNE ROXANNE -
Revision 31

Roxanne enters the room followed by Marie and Ragueneau

CYRANO (CONTD)
Roxanne

He stands and quickly puts the letter in his pocket

It’s cramped in the small room A silence Roxanne and Cyrano
communicate with a quick look between them

CYRANO (CONTD)
(to Marie)
Do you like rabbit stew Downstairs they -

MARIE
I loathe rabbits I hate their taste and I
hate the way they savage a garden

CYRANO
Shank of Lamb

MARIE
Never on a weekend

ROXANNE
She likes tongue

Marie practically salivates

ROXANNE (CONTD)
For heaven’s sake please go and eat

MARIE
Fine And Ill pray for your sins while I
do

CYRANO

(to Ragueneau sotto)
A huge slab of tongue And keep it coming

Ragueneau and Marie go closing the door behind them Roxanne
removes her mask She seems nervous

ROXANNE
I have a confession to make
CYRANO
To me
ROXANNE
(nods )

It concerns you It’s relevant to you
Cyrano nods just managing to contain his anticipation

CYRANO
Shall we sit
Revision 32

He places two chairs side by side two feet apart He sits on
one and holds his hand up concealing his face like a Priest
in a confessional Roxanne chuckles but then sees the bandage

ROXANNE
Oh you’re wounded

CYRANO
A scratch Please

He gestures to the other chair but she remains standing
ROXANNE
I know your shoddy work The dressing’s
loose Come

She takes him over to the window for the light She seats him
at the table and then lays his arm out palm upwards

ROXANNE (CONTD)
May I

Cyrano nods Holding his breath at her proximity Roxanne
carefully unties the bandage and gently unwinds it

ROXANNE (CONTD)
Hmm

CYRANO
Your confession

ROXANNE
It can wait a moment

The cut is deep and still bleeding Roxanne looks concerned

CYRANO
t’s only a scratch

H

ROXANNE
It’s a wound and it needs cleaning

Roxanne fetches the small basin of water

CYRANO
I’ve been wounded many times This is not
a wound

ROXANNE

Then we’ll call it a cut

CYRANO
‘Scratch’ is more accurate

Roxanne dips her handkerchief in water and cleans the cut
Revision 33

ROXANNE
I dispute ‘more’ There are no degrees of
accuracy A thing is either accurate or it
isn’t You taught me that

CYRANO
(amused)
As you wish I’1ll settle for cut

ROXANNE
A deep one In fact the more this cut
reveals itself the more ridiculous your
original choice of word appears Only
someone with a meagre grasp of language
could call this wound a scratch

She looks at him beadily then chuckles As does he

ROXANNE (CONTD)
How did you get it

CYRANO
Last night A duel

ROXANNE

(shakes her head
indulgently)
And look what happens

CYRANO
You should see the other guys

ROXANNE
I’m not impressed by your swordsmanship

CYRANO
Oh I know Or rather I know you pretend
you’re not

She sighs and begins to re-tie the bandage round his hand

ROXANNE

Id be angry with you if you died
CYRANO

Only ‘angry’
ROXANNE

Incandescent This might hurt

She ties the bandage tightly It hurts But Cyrano doesn’t
flinch She smiles at him

ROXANNE (CONTD)
So brave
Revision

CYRANO
Thank you

They gaze at each other warmly

CYRANO (CONTD)
Will you make your confession

ROXANNE
Yes I must And there’s only so much
tongue Marie can chew on

She looks at Cyrano then looks away

A pause

ROXANNE (CONTD)
I feel shy Huh Never mind
ErmYesterday At the theatre

CYRANO
Yes

ROXANNE
Ican barely believe I’m saying this I
realisedor I became aware - suddenly -
that I was in love

CYRANO
I see

ROXANNE
I’m madly in love But the man in question
has no idea

Cyrano permits himself a secret little smile

ROXANNE (CONTD)
AndI don’t know how to tell him

CYRANO
Wellperhaps he feels the same

ROXANNE
It’s possible I have hopes

CYRANO
How do you know you love him

ROXANNE
Becauseit’s as if I’ve always known Or
always known him He was always there but
this intense romantic connection had not
yet manifested

CYRANO
I understand

Revision 35

He steals a glance at her but her profile is inscrutable

ROXANNE
(sudden panic)
Supposing it’s all a delusion

CYRANO
(immediately)
No You’re clearly in love

ROXANNE
My mind’s racing I’m feverish

CYRANO
Would you like some water

ROXANNE
No It’s got your blood in it

CYRANO
You were saying

ROXANNE
I don’t know what I was saying

CYRANO
Tell me about him It might reassure you
there’s no delusion

ROXANNE
Yes Good WellI feel he’s rather
proud And very charming He’s mysterious
but not obscure His face is so bright
with intelligence

Cyrano silently eases his letter from his pocket

A pause

CYRANO
(loving it)
What else

ROXANNE
Ermwell he’s beautiful obviously

CYRANO
Is he

ROXANNE
Oh yes But his natural modesty means
he’s completely unaware of it

CYRANO
I’ve met people like that
A pause

Revision 36

ROXANNE
They are so rare

CYRANO
Yes

Cyrano unfolds his letter unseen by Roxanne

CYRANO (CONTD)
PerhapsI could make a confession too

ROXANNE
Yes but I haven’t finished mine

CYRANO
Sorry Do continue

Roxanne focusses

ROXANNE
Cyrano I need you to help me
CYRANO
At your service
ROXANNE
This man I love is a Guard
CYRANO
Mmm
ROXANNE
In your regiment
CYRANO
Of course he is
ROXANNE
Of course
CYRANO

In the sense that - I interrupted carry
on

ROXANNE
It’s embarrassing to admit but I’ve never
actually spoken to him

CYRANO
Of your love

ROXANNE
Of anything I fell in love with him at
first sight A thunderbolt It’s madness
Fantastical And yet it’s absolutely real
Revision 37

During this Cyrano slowly pockets the letter and turns his
face away from her Tears spring to his eyes

ROXANNE (CONTD)

Cyrano
CYRANO
(weakly)
Here
ROXANNE
You seem —-
CYRANO

Just the wound playing up

ROXANNE
Poor you I’ve got some ointment at home
(barrelling on)
I mean supposing he’s an idiot He might
be just an incredibly beautiful man with
the mind of a - a rabbit
(slight pause)
Except he isn’t He can’t be
(determinedly )
I need him not to be Anyway
I’ve made some discreet inquiries and I’m
told he is Christian - Christian
Neuvillette

CYRANO
(illogical hope)
Neuvillette Never heard of him

ROXANNE
He’s a new recruit he starts today
CYRANO
(dashed)
Ah
ROXANNE

To the point To your presence here I
know how you Guards treat the new
recruits your ancient initiation rituals
and so on The Guards are notorious for
their garrulousness which often descends
into brawling and then duelling and worse
I fear for Christian

CYRANO
Not without cause

ROXANNE
All the guards respect you

Cyrano can’t deny it She turns to him intense desperate
Revision

ROXANNE (CONTD)
So please will you protect him Please
ensure he comes to no harm

She looks at Cyrano who stares helpless

CYRANO

I can refuse you nothing
ROXANNE

And never let him fight a duel
CYRANO

No
ROXANNE

And guard his life with your own
CYRANO

Yes
ROXANNE

And be his friend
(brief pause)
Say you will

CYRANO
(snaps)
I might not like him

ROXANNE
But all the same befriend him
CYRANO
(sighs )
Yes
ROXANNE

And make him write to me
Cyrano flinches
ROXANNE (CONTD)
And I’1l write back We’ll exchange long
poetic love letters
CYRANO
I will suggest that he writes to you but I
can’t control the content or length of his
letters
Cyrano and Roxanne look at each other for a moment

ROXANNE
You’re always so kind

She touches his cheek Cyrano is silent Wounded

Revision 39

ROXANNE (CONTD)
Now You said you have a confession too

CYRANO
It’s not important

ROXANNE
Ill support you as you’ve supported me

CYRANO
Really It’s nothing

She can see he means it

ROXANNE
How’s that hand

CYRANO
Painless A scratch

Roxanne laughs Cyrano manages a smile She senses something’s
not quite right and decides to indulge him

ROXANNE
How many men did you duel with last night
CYRANO
(softly)
A hundred
ROXANNE
Really
CYRANO
Ten

She gently touches his arm

ROXANNE
All the same what courage

CYRANO
I’ve done better since
15 INT GUARDS GARRISON TRAINING YARD - DAY 15

The garrison is a military training facility and housing
complex for the Guards

THE KINGS GUARD ‘By order of His Majesty’ is emblazoned over
the door The training yard is huge and open to the sky

Sword practice shooting ranges horse riding and military
drills are happening concurrently Le Bret - their Captain -
is instructing the group in sword fighting
Revision 40

Cyrano is training with relentless fury push ups jumps
punching bag back to the floor same again He’s in shirt
sleeves and sweating

THE GATE KEEPER
(announcing)
The Duke De Guiche

All the Guards stop training and turn This is an unusual
visit De Guiche is a civilian not a military man The Guards
bow to him grudgingly Le Bret steps forward

DE GUICHE
Captain

Le Bret nods to De Guiche ‘What can I do for you’
De Guiche walks past him to where Cyrano trains
DE GUICHE (CONTD)
(to Cyrano)
I heard of your recent adventure I’ve
come to express my admiration

Le Bret steps towards Cyrano

LE BRET
Cyrano

He barks to the Guards

LE BRET (CONTD)
Carry on

The men return to training Off De Guiche’s look Le Bret stops
Cyrano from doing more push ups

DE GUICHE
I could barely believe it A lone man
triumphant against ten

Cyrano stares Still drained by his encounter with Roxanne

DE GUICHE (CONTD)
I’m inviting you to join my retinue

CYRANO
I thank the Duke for his generous offer
but I must decline

DE GUICHE
There are great advantages to following
me

CYRANO

I know But I follow no one
Revision 41

De Guiche keeps his temper tries a different route

DE GUICHE

I’m told you write poetry - in common with
numerous men these days But I’m told you
write uncommonly well I like to publish
those I admire I could put your work in
print Distinguish you

(smiling)
Id only change a few lines and I pay
handsomely You could buy a fine pair of
calfskin gloves

CYRANO
I’m not for sale Neither is my work

DE GUICHE
Aren’t you proud

CYRANO
Aren’t you observant

DE GUICHE
(firmly)
Take this seriously

The guards start to watch the yard slowly grows quieter

DE GUICHE (CONTD)
Those men last night were incompetent
Others might not be Someone out there has
taken against you Join my retinue and
youll be protected

The Guards and the Yard are now silent

CYRANO
First you try to recruit me Then you
try to buy me When you learn I have no
price you warn me my life is threatened
by an unknown enemy

Cyrano comes close to De Guiche so no one else hears this
exchange

CYRANO (CONTD)
I saw you last night The blood of those
ten dead souls is on your hands You’re a
tyrant posing as a noble

DE GUICHE
It’s a shame we can’t accommodate each
other You’d be a sweet companion for the
acquisition I will make Roxanne

A jolt of fear surges through Cyrano De Guiche turns and
walks away His footsteps echo

It’s the new recruit

Christian stands awkwardly The Guards approach him They
whistle and make threatening sounds They look like theyre
going to kill him Christian rolls up his sleeves
CHRISTIAN
I’ve heard how this works I’m ready
Who’s first

A huge tough GUARD steps forward The men applaud Christian
knocks him down with one blow The men are staggered

Cyrano has been watching and suspects this must be Christian

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
Who’s next

Cyrano charges into the center of the circle

CYRANO
I am

Christian laughs The Guards go quiet Sixty Guards stand in a
wide circle around them Tension

CYRANO (CONTD)
What’s so funny

CHRISTIAN
First I must fight an elephant and now a
mole

Cyrano draws a sword Christian too

CYRANO
On guard
CHRISTIAN
Just remember you drew first
CYRANO

CHRISTIAN

Rev 102320 (Blue) 44

Cyrano suddenly throws his sword down and runs at Christian
full tilt He tackles him gets the advantage - keeping
Christian off his feet he then drags him out of the yard The
Guards watch waiting for the death blow

GARRISON STORES AND CELLAR CONT 18

Cyrano pushes Christian down the stairs into the cellar
Cyrano walks slowly down the steps with his arms held open

CYRANO

She believes so
Rev 102320 (Blue) 45
Christian’s face breaks into a huge grin he grabs Cyrano’s
hand and shakes it hard

CHRISTIAN
Sir I am so glad to know you

The shaking goes on a bit too long

CYRANO
That’s enough now

CHRISTIAN
Forgive me please for insulting you

CHRISTIAN

CYRANO
Youre right you’d better leave town
(Christian looks
woeful)
I didn’t mean it

CHRISTIAN
I’m very confused Are you here to help me
or hinder me

CYRANO
(sighs)
Help

CHRISTIAN
You see in battle I have inordinate
courage I can do anything But with
women my whole life I’ve been useless
silent I’mwhat’s that word for when
youre bad at expressing yourself

CYRANO
Inarticulate

CHRISTIAN
That’s it I can’t express what I feel -
on paper andnot on paper I dont know
how to speak romantically Roxanne will be
extremely disappointed

CYRANO
She must not be

CHRISTIAN
But I have no wit

Cyrano thinks Knows what he must do

CYRANO

CHRISTIAN
Eh

CYRANO

CHRISTIAN
I can’t It’s a lie Id be deceiving the
woman I love

CYRANO
Well it’s better than losing her

As Christian begins to sing in the cellar of the garrison we
see the Guards training in the yard above and as he sings the
training slowly morphs into a waltz - soldiers dancing with
soldiers in contrast to the flour ballet this is a stoic
respectful observed expression of courtship - it’s beautiful
but militaristic and stiff

CHRISTIAN
I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY
ALL THE WORDS I DON’T HAVE
AND I CAN’T PUT TOGETHER
I’D GIVE ANYTHING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY TO
HER THAT SHE’S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
AND I CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT HER

The Guards blend marching and drills and dance - as if sixty
soldiers standing at attention suddenly all pirouette - a
dream of freedom of expression within a rigid form

MY FATHER TOLD ME LETTERS AND BOOKS
WEREN’T MEANT FOR THE SON OF A SOLDIER
COURAGE AND STEAL THE TRIALS OF THE REAL

CYRANO

I always have a letter in my pocket

romantic custom here

CHRISTIAN
But don’t we need to make it specific to
her

CYRANO

was only for her

CHRISTIAN
But the letter itself is applicable to all
women

CYRANO

Not all but most

CHRISTIAN

hand against the door Rather then knock he puts the letter
under the door and runs away

INT ROXANNES DOOR INSIDE HER HOME DAYS LATER 21
A letter with no return address is slid under the door

letters the scenes overlap within the song moving back and
forth faster and faster building to the climatic end

Another letter appears under the door Roxanne rushes to
collect it and goes to the window where she sees Christian
running away

Christian hears her sing the last line

ROXANNE
YOUR LETTERS ARE DRAWINGS ON ME FROM ABOVE
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND I KNOW YOU ARE LOVE

The deception has succeeded He looks at her conflicted and
guilty loving and longing

26 EXT A PUBLIC GARDEN DAYS LATER SPRING 26

Cyrano and Roxanne walking through a maze Marie a few paces
behind

ROXANNE
Every day I think ‘I couldn’t love him
more’ Then a new letter arrives and my
heart expands to accommodate more love
He understands me instinctively he knows
exactly what I respond to what thrills
me It’s uncanny - but so exciting

CYRANO
I’m pleased for you

ROXANNE
But are you

CYRANO

Why wouldn’t I be

ROXANNE

Well it’s quite tedious having to listen
to someone waxing on about finding true
love

She looks back at Marie vaguely examining a weed Roxanne
steers Cyrano into a row of hedges out of sight

ROXANNE (CONTD)
I want to meet with him In private Can
you arrange it

CYRANO
Erm
Revision 54

ROXANNE
I need to know him

A pause Cyrano just manages to control his jealousy

CYRANO
Would you love him if he wasn’t handsome

ROXANNE
I can’t imagine it He’s beautiful and
expresses himself beautifully It’s
perfectly logical

CYRANO
(suddenly)
Roxanne I must tell you -

But she’s straight in

ROXANNE
“The more you take of my heart the more I
have to give”
“Since I need a heart to long for you
keep mine and send me yours”

CYRANO
First he has too much heart then not
enough

ROXANNE

(pokes him)
You’re jealous

CYRANO
Me (startled - quietly)
e

ROXANNE
Of his writing It’s fascinating you’re
both brilliant but exact opposites in
style Christian is overt passionate
fiery

CYRANO

Whereas I

ROXANNE

You arecoded witty rueful
CYRANO

Coded
ROXANNE

Yes You know it None of us know what’s
really going on in that whirring brain of
yours
Revision 55

Then she worries she’s offended him

ROXANNE (CONTD)
His words aren’t better than yours Just
differently put But both are endlessly

quotable
CYRANO

You know his letters by heart
ROXANNE

Every one
CYRANO

Im flattered
Roxanne looks confused

CYRANO (CONTD)
- On his behalf

ROXANNE
You’1l1 arrange the meeting

CYRANO
As ever I’m at your service

He bows to her then walks away in a foul mood

27 INT CYRANO’S ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER NEW SCENE 27

Cyrano at his desk Christian stood over his shoulder reading
the letter aloud as Cyrano writes

Cyrano dislikes this but tolerates it
CHRISTIAN
“Our mutual friend the” - what’s this
CYRANO
‘Redoubtable’
CHRISTIAN
(reading)
“Our mutual friend the redoubtable Cyrano
has informed me that you wish to meet I
am deeply honoured by this new”

Cyrano Dear friend

Cyrano stops work abruptly annoyed by the interruption
CHRISTIAN (CONTD)

Redoubtable I just wouldn’t say it
It’s not me
Revision 56

CYRANO
It’s not you

Cyrano carries on writing while Christian seethes

28 INT ROXANNES SITTING ROOM
Roxanne Marie and De Guiche - who sports new uniform

DE GUICHE
I’ve come to say goodbye I leave tonight
for the front It’s grim But orders are
orders

ROXANNE
Grim

DE GUICHE
We’re losing the war Its ugly Theyve
promoted the nobility to turn it around
As you see they’ve made me a Colonel
(false modesty)
Me Shows how desperate they are

Roxanne smiles appropriately Then worries
ROXANNE
Does this new rank put you in command of
the Guards

DE GUICHE
It does Cyrano is mine

Roxanne - alert to this

ROXANNE

Are the Guards being sent to the front
DE GUICHE

Naturally They’re in my regiment
ROXANNE

All of them
DE GUICHE

Of course
Roxanne turns away Devastated De Guiche detects it

DE GUICHE (CONTD)
Why upset dear lady

ROXANNE
Youre going to war you might die and
youre leaving tonightI’mbeside
myself

Revision

DE GUICHE
May I take your concern as a sign of
affection

Roxanne nods a fraction Thinks

ROXANNE
I must tell you that Cyrano is no longer
my friend In truth we have ceased to
like each other I ended it - as you

counseled
DE GUICHE

Good

A pause

ROXANNE

I know how you could make him suffer
DE GUICHE

Oh
ROXANNE

Why don’t you leave him and all the
Guards behind Make them idle here in the
city with the women and children

DE GUICHE
(chuckles)
He’d hate that

ROXANNE
More than ‘hate’ it would humiliate him
no heroics no medals no glory His
warrior pride is his great weakness

DE GUICHE
Indeed I like it
(takes her in)
Only a woman could concoct such a plan

ROXANNE
Only a man could say so

De Guiche moves closer to Roxanne

DE GUICHE
Am I to understand this as an act of love

ROXANNE
(very firm defiant)
It is

DE GUICHE
I hereby bury his orders to the front

Revision 58
He takes out the orders and separates the Guards from the
rest Roxanne just manages to conceal her relief
DE GUICHE (CONTD)
Poor little Cyrano and all his little

friends

De Guiche gazes at Roxanne lust overwhelming him

DE GUICHE (CONTD)
Marie Some tea

MARIE
I’m afraid we are out of tea sir

DE GUICHE
(snaps )
Leave us

Marie gets up reluctantly She leaves the room looking at
Roxanne with warning

De Guiche stares at Roxanne Then touches her cheek Her
lips

DE GUICHE (CONTD)
I like your tricks I wager you know some
more

ROXANNE
No sir

DE GUICHE
I think you do
(breathing her in)
How can I leave you
(pause)
Maybe I wont I love you Roxanne I love
you

Roxanne conceals her horror as he edges closer to her

ROXANNE

DE GUICHE
I’m not brave Im dutiful

ROXANNE
Youre too modest It’s you who will lead
the charge into battle I couldn’t love a
man who hides from danger

DE GUICHE
Do you love me

ROXANNE
I love the man for whom I fear

DE GUICHE
So I must go to war

ROXANNE
(manages a tear)
Yes

De Guiche stares at her hard Then gets up and crosses the

room At the door he turns back-

DE GUICHE
One last look at the woman I love

He throws open the door and runs straight into Marie

INT ROXANNE’S HALL AND DOOR CONT

Marie shows De Guiche out handing him his coat and hat
turns to find Roxanne standing behind her-

MARIE
Put out this fire you’re playing with Let
the men go and fight their wars

ROXANNE
The Guards must never go to the front -
it’s a death sentence

MARIE
If De Guiche finds out you’ve used him
youll end your days in a brothel - or
worse - a convent

ROXANNE
I will protect those I love whatever the
cost to myself

Marie
Revision 60

MARIE
But think If you marry him now he’1l most
likely be killed in battle within the
month You’d be a rich widow and beyond
reproach You could grant me a pension
Think about it

ROXANNE
I’m attending a salon tonight I must
dress

32 EXT THE STREET APPROACHING ROXANNE’S HOUSE EVENING

Cyrano and Christian walking fast - mid-argument Cyrano
highly agitated Christian pretty cool

CYRANO
This is folly

CHRISTIAN
She said she wants to meet me so whats
wrong with surprising her

CYRANO
You’re not prepared

CHRISTIAN
She loves me I dont need to prepare Why
cant you relax

CYRANO
Will you at least look at these
conversational witticisms

Cyrano hands Christian a sheet of densely written paper

CHRISTIAN
No thank you
CYRANO
Memorise this now
CHRISTIAN
No I’m going to speak to her in my own
words
CYRANO

I strongly advise against it

CHRISTIAN
And when the moment is right I will take
her in my arms

CYRANO
There will be no ‘moment’ if you don’t
study this

Revision 61

He thrusts the document at Christian who rebuffs it

CHRISTIAN
I’ll be fine All your fancy words and
phrases are now in my vocabulary I will
simply repeat them - no what is it

CYRANO
Regurgitate them

CHRISTIAN
That’s it That’s what I will do

A pause Cyrano considers

CYRANO
Off you go then

Christian turns to go then turns back

CHRISTIAN
I’m very grateful for all your help
butwith extreme respect I don’t think
I need you anymore

CYRANO
(smiles)
I’m sure you’re right Now fly to Roxanne

Cyrano bows to Christian turns and walks away Hes greatly
amused by this development

CYRANO (CONTD)

And so it ends

Suddenly - Roxanne sees him Surprised and delighted she
momentarily falters Christian smiles warmly

Roxanne finishes her lecture to wild applause Christian claps
at the door

As the salon guests get up from their chairs Christian starts
to leave Then - hes thrilled to see Roxanne come running out
the door to find him

Both are very nervous at this first proper encounter

ROXANNE

are taking tea below in the stalls

CHRISTIAN

CHRISTIAN
No But I dont like heights

Roxanne laughs she thinks hes joking Christian is
confused by having not got the joke He remains speechless
He cant think of a thing to say

After a while

ROXANNE
There are some silences that are
comfortable and there are some that are
freightened with tensions What do you
think is the nature of this one

Christian thinks very hard

CHRISTIAN
I thinkits a bit of both

ROXANNE

ROXANNE
You were talking of a kiss

CYRANO
Yes but what is a kiss

promise A confession Is it a secret a
moment of eternity a communion a heart
beat

EXT MOUNTAINGUARDS EMBANKMENTCAMP - DAY (MONTHS LATER) 61

A vast cold black landscape empty and desolate A low lying
mist rolls down a mountain peak

A small battalion of SOLDIERS perched almost on the top of the
mountain Theyre holding the high ground and paying dearly
for it They have no tents only makeshift shelters Their
uniforms are tattered supplemented with sheepskin rugs and
metal Theyre starving and wounded

Christian looks wrecked Hes sitting on a rock by a canon
cleaning his weapon starving staring out at the ruined land

Occasionally a shot rings out more sport than combat a
reminder of the terror they face

Song CLOSE MY EYES
Words in BOLD are sung by the entire company of Guards

CHRISTIAN
HOW IS IT I FEEL YOU CLOSER TO ME NOW THAT
THE WORLD’S BETWEEN US
WHAT I WOULDN’T DO JUST TO GET SOME SLEEP

DO SO THE MACHINE TAKES OVER

Cyrano runs beside a path never on it he swiftly zig zags
across the barren ground

CHRISTIAN
SOMETIMES YOUR VOICE IS ALL THAT I CAN

BUT NOW IT SOUNDS MILES AWAY
DOES IT EVER FEEL LIKE THIS TO YOU
ROXANNE I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO

EXT THE VALLEYENEMY CAMP DAWN SAME DAY 65
‘Close My Eyes’ continues

Cyrano picks his way through the enemy camp past well ordered
tents in long straight rows He reaches the front line where
well attended canons stand ready A group of INFANTRY MEN in
clean new uniforms are slumped against a canon - all of them
asleep

Cyrano silently runs towards them and stops in the space next
to the canon shaft Beneath the canon is a basket of APPLES

He quickly takes as many as he can pack in his pockets -
determined to steal as much as possible

As hes about to leap into ‘no-mans land’ one of the infantry
wakes up and SHOUTS -

enough he hears someone coming He pulls a rope to sound the
alarm An early telegraph system alerts the right sentry who
in turn pulls another rope alerting HQ

Cyrano dive over the ridge shots ringing out around him
and dive into the bell

Inside the bell Cyrano takes a moment to catch his breath

Or he doesnt want the blood of an entire

company on his hands

The attendant waits holding the orders with quill in hand

Cyrano slowly walks up the street Hes unsteady
He walks past Roxannes old house He stops a moment

This is a very long walk for him He has to stop Searing pain
attacks his side

Suddenly he falls to the ground He simply collapses A woman
screams PEOPLE rush to his aid

Amongst them is LE BRET - still Captain of the Guards - in his
uniform Hes run from Ragueneaus having heard the screams

Le Bret cradles Cyrano in his arms Cyrano slowly opens his
eyes and recognises him He manages a smile despite the pain

LE BRET
Hello old friend
CYRANO
Did I fall
LE BRET
Not at all The ground rose up and hit
you

Cyrano smiles He has a small cut on his brow which Le Bret
dabs with his handkerchief

INT CHURCH UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MOMENTS LATER

Roxanne almost runs into Cyrano as she rushes towards the
convent and he emerges out of it

CYRANO
Going somewhere

ROXANNE
Youre late

CYRANO
Yes I was delayed

ROXANNE

CYRANO
An untimely visitor

ROXANNE
You sent him away

CYRANO
I fear I only put him off for a short
while

ROXANNE

Well hell have to wait because I wont
let you leave before nightfall

She helps him to the bench and he sits with relief

ROXANNE (CONTD)
Youve cut yourself

Cyrano waves away her concern as firmly as he can

CYRANO
A scratch Really

Cyrano closes his eyes Sister Claire is sweeping at a
distance

ROXANNE
Aren’t you going to tease Sister Claire
She waits all week for it you know

Sister Claire blushes and looks down
CYRANO
Sister Claire You have such lovely eyes

why do you keep them cast down

SISTER CLAIRE
Oh

A pause

Rev 121420 (Green) 103

CYRANO

I ate good meat yesterday

SISTER CLAIRE
When youre ready come to the dining hall

SISTER CLAIRE

CYRANO
Tonight for once I will let you pray for

SISTER CLAIRE

CYRANO

Sister Claire touches Cyrano’s arm and leaves But something
troubles her about all this

Cyrano tenderly watches Roxanne as she works

CYRANO (CONTD)

Do you remember the day we first met
ROXANNE

(laughing)

Yes
CYRANO

It was an early morning in early June Id
come to borrow a book from your father We
found you in the library curled up on the
floor in the dawn light a tome for a
pillow reading the very book Id come
for

ROXANNE
I refused to hand it over
Rev 121420 (Green)

CYRANO
Your youth made it forgivable

ROXANNE
I hadnt finished reading it

CYRANO
I didnt mind You said you would give it
tome as soon as you had

ROXANNE
And I did As if wed always known each
other

CYRANO
And now we have

Cyrano looks up at the light coming in

He nods

CYRANO (CONTD)
They say light is the soul of a holy
space Its designed to be enough
enough beauty to to just let go

ROXANNE
Are you melancholy

CYRANO
(trying to rally)
No No

ROXANNE
Do you have my daily paper

ROXANNE (CONTD)
Good

Rev 121420 (Green) 105

Cyrano gives his paper but its a struggle to speak and
breathe

CYRANO
Last Saturday the nineteenth I saw you
And then a week passed in which nothing
important happened and now here I am
again

ROXANNE
Cyrano

CYRANO

Yes The news Last Saturday the Head Of
State ate too many prunes and took to his
bed with a fever he was executed by his
physician and now he is feeling much
better There was a ball last Sunday and
seven hundred and sixty three wax candles
were burned Out On Monday our troops
were reported to have beaten - everyone -
everywhere Tuesday a little tiny dog had
to be given a very large enema

(Roxanne laughs )
On Wednesdaynothing Thursday someone
somewhere who isn’t us took a new lover
On Friday

Cyrano feels faint His eyes close

CYRANO (CONTD)
I was the Queen of - almost Today

Roxanne sees his eyes are closed

ROXANNE
Shall we get you that soup
CYRANO

ROXANNE
My dear Whats to be done

Cyrano looks at her and smiles - weak

CYRANO
It’s just my old wound from the war

ROXANNE
Damn that war

Roxanne touches her breast where she keeps a letter
CYRANO

You told meone dayyou would let me
read Christians last letter
Rev 121420 (Green) 106

ROXANNE
Now

CYRANO
Please

As the sky darkens Roxanne hands him the letter he wrote from
Christian fifteen years before

As Cyrano opens the envelope we see blood on it

CYRANO (CONTD)
“Farewell Roxanne I believe this will be
my last day my beloved My soul is heavy
with unexpressed love Fullness of heart
can not be recorded It will not live on
in my bones when Im gone it will not be
buried in my grave The exact measure of
my love can not be given to you in words
to outlast my last breath No matter how I
wish it I am dust and dust to dust”-

Its dark now Roxanne watches him closely Hes not reading
but reciting His eyes closed

CYRANO (CONTD)
“I am going to die today-

ROXANNE
You’re not reading Youre remembering

He folds the letter Shrugs A simple sign of admission
regret longing sorrow Love

She gets up Walks away Now turns on him

ROXANNE (CONTD)
It was you

CYRANO

No Roxanne

CYRANO

The voice in the night below my balcony -

your words

CYRANO
You married him - not my words
ROXANNE
Why are you denying it
CYRANO
BecauseI dont love you my love
ROXANNE

yours
CYRANO

The blood is his

ROXANNE
Why tell me now

CYRANO

ROXANNE
After fifteen years - why

Cyrano gets to his feet shaky and unsure He faces her and
speaks the heartfelt truth

CYRANO
I believe this will be my last day

ROXANNE
No
Rev 121420 (Green) 108

Cyrano falls to the ground - collapses into the leaves

ROXANNE (CONTD)

Roxanne holds him in her arms
Song NO CYRANO

She looks him in the eye She knows hes about to die and

needs him to know this
ROXANNE (CONTD)
I love Cyrano Cyrano is my love Ive

He gazes at her a moment full of regret

CYRANO
And I lovedmy pride

Cyrano dies in Roxanne’s arms
The leaves slowly fall

In the distance the nuns are walking to mass

Sister Claire comes running from the building fear in her

eyes

Roxanne is weeping

FADE TO BLACK
