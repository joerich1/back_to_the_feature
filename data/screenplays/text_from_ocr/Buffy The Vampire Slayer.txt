FADE IN

EXT MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET

We see an Italian village at the height of the plague
processions decrepit houses with their windows boarded
the stench of death all around

TITLE EUROPE THE DARK AGES

Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse He is weary
not so dingy as his surrounding a stranger in these

He comes to an inn where a boy takes his horse round

He enters the inn

INT INN - SAME TIME

The inn is dark and almost empty A couple of patrons
silently at tables Behind the bar stands a slovenly
dark-haired and lazy She scratches at her shoulder on
we see a birthmark The knight approaches the bar

The barmaid leads the knight by candlelight upstairs to

places a hand on the barmaids hip She pauses a moment
breaks free of his grasp starts down the hall He

bit resignedly and closes the door

A VAMPIRE stands behind it Not two feet from the
grinning at him His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing
head his bloody smile full with teeth His skin is
peeling The knight turns slowly and sees him

KNIGHT
Oh my god

The vampire licks his lips

He is on the knight in a second pushing him backwards
the middle of the small room The knight struggles but
match for the vampire who buries his face in the

neck The knight screams

She runs at the window

EXT IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME
The vampire comes running out the front door Before he
few feet from the front of the inn the Slayer SMASHES
the upstairs window and lands on him They both hit the
and she plants the stake right in his heart
After a moment we hear a voice
AMILYN (0S)
The lord giveth and the lord taketh
away Ashes ashes
She looks up
AMILYN

(continuing)

All fall down
There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her
the otherwise deserted street At the front maybe ten
away is AMILYN
Amilyn is a grinning jackal a servant to the Vampire-
His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtiers
ambles toward the Slayer giggling as she stands
Behind her is LOTHOS the Vampire-King His skin is deep

and smooth He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of

era He is practically upon her before he speaks
LOTHOS
You must forgive Amilyn He tends
to drool before supper

She turns He smiles almost lovingly

SLAYER
Lothos

LOTHOS
You people will never learn

She swings at him but he grabs her arm Amilyn laughs
obnoxiously Lothos grabs the back of the Slayers head

brings
her to him in a loving embrace
LOTHOS
(continuing)
We cant be stopped This is our
world now
He pulls her head back swiftly snapping her spine as her
head
hits the back of her legs Lightning flashes

INT ENGLISH CASTLE - NIGHT
Lightning flashes outside the window It is torrenting
rain
An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or so
They
are both obviously noble of birth
GIRL
I cant
MAN
You know you must There is only
one Now you are that one It is
time
GIRL

Why Why me

MAN
She has died You are the next to
be called Why do you think you
were sent to me Trained as you
were You bear the mark

He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her
shoulder
identical to the barmaids

MAN
(continuing)
The mark of the Coven

GIRL
I dont understand

MAN
Ever since Adam and Eve first left
the garden he followed the serpent
Satan He sends his legion in the
shape of men to feed on us to
breed his Hell on our earth They
are a plague upon us

The man unravels a satchel of cloth From it he pulls an
elaborately carved wooden stake

MAN

(continuing)
But as long as there have been
vampire there has been the Coven
the line of Slayers Ones with the
strength and the skill to kill them
to find them where they gather and
stop the swell of their numbers
One dies the next is called

GIRL
Im just a girl

MAN
You are much more

He hands her the stake She feels the fit
MAN
(continuing)

One dies the next is called

As she grips the stake more tightly an awareness and
sense of

power sees to fill her She lifts the stake over her
head

BESSEL is right behind him
Wally is a ninth grader small nerdy and recently
In marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue
is freshly undead He still has fat on his face in

looks almost normal from afar But his inhuman eyes and

uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire And the way he
before

hoists

is unearthly Hollow almost detached

repeating phrases

sometimes almost as though he had never heard them

He smiles at Grueller

GRUELLER

(continuing)
Bessel What are you doing here

WALLY

Hi Grueller

GRUELLER

I was scared

She is waking up obviously from being knocked out She
stupidly looks around She is lying by a pool of what

to be dark water in a large cave Torches burn around

She tries to get up and finds it difficult She pulls

up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her

Its blood

She starts staring with growing horror at her hands
does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first
Its Lothos He wears no shirt only white trousers and
the style maybe Nineteenth Century No blood seems to
him as he rises He looks at Cassandra with an almost

lust
LOTHOS
I find it restorative sleeping in
the life-blood of so many To feel
their souls coursing about me

CASSANDRA
Whats happening What do you want

LOTHOS
(smiling)
So very much

CASSANDRA
My parents have money

LOTHOS
Yes Im sure they do This place

hisses bares his fangs at Cassandra

wealth the greed the waste
its truly heartwarming The perfect
place to spread my empire Honestly
Eastern Europe was so dead the
Communists just drained the blood
out of the place Its livened up
a bit in the past few years but
its nothing compared to this
this Mecca of consumption The
city of Angels

He steps right up to her

LOTHOS
(continuing)
What are we We are man perfected
We exist to consume

On the world to consume we see Amilyn mouthing the
words

with Lothos his eyes to the ceiling Hes heard this a
hundred

Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet

Amilyn snatches it from her looks it over

LOTHOS
She has a certain quality this

Amilyn bites the card
AMILYN

LOTHOS

Not as single-minded as the others

not as sybaritic Almost thoughtful

Shes useless

CASSANDRA
No wait I can be dumb Really

Or mean or whatever I can learn

LOTHOS
Really

CASSANDRA
Swear to God

He rips out her throat tearing at it with his teeth as

gushes around their faces and she wriggle twists

dies

hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth

A Vampire-King You mean like
Dracula

MERRICK
Oh yes And the man from your
dreams Lothos

BUFFY
Oh him

MERRICK
Yes They travel about usually
with one or two of their followers
to lay the groundwork The vampires
find a community and they feed on
it make it their own You were
difficult to trace and I think the
process has gone a lot further than
Id anticipated Usually this goads
a community into some kind of
paranoid frenzy But for some
reason nobody here seems to be
paying any attention

BUFFY
(not paying attention)
What

MERRICK
(annoyed)
Well cover it later

BUFFY
I still dont get how they happened
to come to my town I mean was I
born here because because they

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE (MOMENTS LATER)

A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Gruellers flight
late Buffy roars into view behind him She navigates
streets with less ease than determination

Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike

violently bumpy and erratic course through the site She
finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from

bike She hits the ground hard she rolls into it but
trouble getting up
BUFFYS POV
Gruellers smiling face appears over her
GRUELLER
Fall down go boom have to see the

He brings his face right next to hers His voice is no

passionless it boils up from hell

GRUELLER

RESUME SCENE
He grabs her and hauls her up

BUFFY

He smiles again and leans toward her neck
The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a

Behind him stands Pike
One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike who
away Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto
impaling him as well
Pike runs more or less in a circle yelling the vampire
his heels
PIKE

I didnt mean it I didnt mean

Wooden shard in hand Buffy sprints toward them jumps
series of flips She lands with her legs around the
shoulders plants the stake in its heart as they topple
Pike
For a moment Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other

hard Then they get up awkwardly embarrassed by their
touching (and by their slight arousal)

BUFFY
I didnt expect to see you

PIKE

throat
He cannot move or breathe
stuck

gritting

Merrick and Lothos look at each other a moment

LOTHOS
Its a beautiful night I have
never understood the human tendency
to equate darkness with emptiness
To me the black is so thick with
life like soil like blood
Darkness writhes under my eye

He looks at the night Merrick slowly reaches for
in the back of his pants as Lothos continues
LOTHOS

Merrick holds it firm behind his back finger on the

trigger
LOTHOS

Lothos rushes suddenly at Merrick hissing his feet just

himself without hesitation in the head

Buffys eyes go wide

Lothos growls holding Merricks spurting corpse

A small involuntary noise escapes Buffy

CLOSEUP - LOTHOS

Even twenty yards away he hears He spins and stares
at CAMERA Listening

He grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her

against

Suddenly screaming he forces her over suddenly with such

that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards

INT LOTHOS CHAMBER - SAME TIME
The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into
blood pool
Amilyns body surfaces first now just a husk
Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood soaked and

Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action She throws a

punches at Lothos

but he takes them without flinching

grabs at the stake in what remains of Amilyns chest

quick Lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes

stake splinters and she screams with pain He knocks her

on her ass

She starts moving backward away from him but it is hard

for her to make her way through the thick gore lLothos
contemplates Amilyns corpse and his face darkens

Ah

LOTHOS
(continuing)
my fool is dead He was

careless always Still Ill pull
out your tongue for that

(coming toward her)

Dont you understand Ive killed
you a dozen times Your life is

not a blink of my eye not a single
breath I have lived in the shadows
in the pulsing filth behind mens
eyes A thousand years and more

I have conversed with the worms

that fed on my corpse and I have
bathed in the blood of emperors

both lustful and disdainful
LOTHOS

Youre even weaker than the others

BUFFY
I think youve forgotten something

She pulls out a small cross holds it in front of him
snarls at it then grabs it his hand around her The
bursts into flame He holds her hand onto it
