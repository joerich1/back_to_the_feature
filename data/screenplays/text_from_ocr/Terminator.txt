EXT SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT 1

Silence Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
audible A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link
fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
ings Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
dows This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar
neighborhood

ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS where a trash dumpster looms
in a LOW ANGLE part of the clutter behind the gymnasium

A CAT enters FRAME CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD prowling with
him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows

CLOSE ON CAT which freezes alert sensing something just
beyond human perception

A sourceless wind rises and with it a keening WHINE
Papers blow across the pavement

The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster

Windows rattle in their frames

The WHINE intensifies accompanied now by a wash of frigid
PURPLE LIGHT A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-
head blows in all the windows facing the yard

CU - CAT its eyes are wide as the glare dies

faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacobs Ladder

EXT SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT 2

SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides
FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling
faced away in the previously empty yard

He stands slowly

The man is in his late thirties tall and powerfully built
moving with graceful precision

CU - MAN his facial features reiterate the power of his
body and are dominated by the eyes which are intense blue
and depthless His hair is military short

This man is the TERMINATOR

He glances down taking calm inventory of himself and
notices that a fine white ash covers his skin He brushes
at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence scanning
his surroundings

CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARDCITY - NIGHT 2AFX

CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
cityscape below The school is perched at the edge of a pro-
montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-
ing and glistening under a sullen sky The night clouds are
shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING presaging
a thunderstorm

Terminator stands hands on hips in prefect symmetry gazing
down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT

SECOND PUNK
(bracing)
Fuck you asshole

Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple
with blinding speed The blow flings him with a CLANG into
the jungle gym He drops to the ground in a still heap

eyes open twitching

The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
motion Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-
wielders wrist in an inhuman grip Then he punches the
leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone

ANGLE - PAVEMENT as the knife clatters down The punks
combat boots are on tiptoe barely touching the ground

ANGLE - TWO SHOT Terminator and the leader are close
together as if dancing but motionless Their bodies are in
total shadow The punks eyes are wide his veins distended
with an agonizing pressure Terminator jerks his fist back
with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME

The last tough is stumbling away gaping with terror He
backs into a chainlink fence turns to run along it finds
he is in a corner

Terminator takes a step toward him his gaze ominous

The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes
Thunder peals overhead

EXT STREETNEARBY - NIGHT 4

A light RAIN begins to fall

EXT DOWNTOWN STREETALLEY - NIGHT 5
Another part of the city Seedy apartments and storefronts
The streets glisten hissing with sporadic late night traffic
SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined

with trash containers and fire escapes From a recessed
doorway two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement

An angry inarticulate DRUNKARDS MONOLOGUE rises occasionally
above the rain sounds

ANGLE - DOORWAY The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
around him A shockwave hurls trash into the air

Painted over windows shatter

Rat scurry blinded

A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks
the pavement with a muddy splash

CU - DERELICT as he blinks at the fading glare amazed

A NAKED MAN compact and muscular rises in a defensive
crouch KYLE REESE is 22 but his face has been aged by
ordeal the mouth hard eyes grim A crinkled burn scar
traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead Other
scars from burns and bullets mar his hard-muscled body

The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire
escapes behind him HISSING and SPUTTERING The sound
fades then stops altogether to be replaced by a rising
scream of animal agony

Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley

CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and
clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork The
man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
gasp CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through
the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
shoulder by a railing He has materialized in the same

space occupied by the fire escape structure The figure
slumps motionless

Reese quickly checks for signs of life The man is dead

Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
huddled in the doorway

A pair of flamboyantly dressed women obviously working
girls passes by the alley mouth They do a double take
when they see Reese but walk on without breaking stride
completely jaded Hes certainly not a potential customer

Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk

DERELICT

real bright light

sprawled drunk just pulling on the others trousers

The cruiser chirps to a stop The doors fly open and two
cops leap out

Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-

His bare arms are sinewy and scarred

Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN

He look at the glossy photos the glossy women

Fantasy women Svelte and seamless

His face is bathed in sweat lit by the glow from a CRT

Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate a GIRL

of about sixteen gaunt dirty heavily armed like himself
DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones

Reese looks up

Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying
SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the skyobscured by dust

Reese crawls pacing the H-K under and through on elbows
and knees past mounds of charred skulls They

pass the BODY OF A CHILD a boy of about 10 center-
punched with a smoking hole The boy clutches a rifle
More bodies Some in rags some in uniforms like theirs
WOMEN OLD MEN CHILDREN Theyre all dirty and gaunt
scabrous And still bleeding Reese scrabbles past a

dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it Some of them
are sobbing or screaming

Another EXPLOSION

invented yet Soldiers in a nightmare war

outflanked the massive H-K Its flashing blue lights flick

him out-of-focus FG

Sarah looks up

ECU - REESES HAND sliding slowly along polished steel
a caress His finger slips through the triggerguard of the
riot gun

MEDIUM ON SARAH as the man stops in front of her in close

He sits slowly in the booth opposite her The angle is OVER
HIS SHOULDER

SARAH
(uncertainly)
Lieutenant Vukovich

REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt Vukovich
Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT
Blue eyes so pure and deep The eyes of a saint perhaps

The 45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA almost
in one motion
The bore seems enormous

BACK ON SARAH over the gun barrel her eyes go wide We hold
a BEAT like a frozen slice of nightmare

MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-
tion his overcoat falling back with a snap HE FIRES
ON TERMINATOR as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES
simultaneously Sarah screams as the 45 round blows stuffing
out of the booth seat inches from her face Her hair is
singed by burning gunpowder An involuntary cry is punched
out of her by the double concussions

Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises
from booth

OVER REESES SHOULDER as he fires cocks the slide fires
again advancing on Sarahs booth

Terminator is blown backward over the center divider
crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the
table opposite and onto the floor

Sarah is screaming scrunched down in the booth

Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-
full of drunk patrons

He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one
in the arm

The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau cowering
gaping

Sarah stops screaming

Reese stand motionless gun aimed

In the sudden silence the sound of him cocking the shotgun
is abnormally loud

ON TERMINATOR very still

Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine
pistol from beneath his overcoat where it has been hang-
ing on a shoulder strap

He doesnt seem too impaired as he swings around to fire

Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing

A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood
An orgy of shattering glass

Total pandemonium

SEVERAL ANGLES as patrons of the bar run scream or dive
for cover depending upon their level of intelligence

Reese slides through the glass to Sarahs booth and seizes
her wrists

ON TERMINATOR kneeling amid the chaos raising the UZI
one-handed

Reese tugs viciously on Sarahs arm and she sprawls across
the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion
erupt with hits from the UZI

ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches
him in the chest He pitches into Sarahs booth pinning
her

Reese fires ducks fires again

Tables crash over

A window is blown out

A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol
behind the bar

It ignites with a WHOOSH

Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun

TIGHT ON TERMINATOR an island of slow precise movement
amid the confusion He drops a spent clip Reaches for
another with his bloody hand

MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts
firing At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into

Terminators belly

We know this is Terminators POV because Sarah and Reese
are just ahead of us But the image is bizarre alien

Bright and hyper-real There is a hint of digitization
and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the

background suggesting infra-red

The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT-
type characters columns of numbers and acronyms The

data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow
There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see
The sound effects are bright and clear as if they are
digitized and enhanced as well

Reese is reloading on the run dropping shells

Behind them Terminator enters the alley gaining

LOW ANGLE FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair

As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard
pitching her on her face to the pavement

He flings open the car doora shield

Drops to the ground

Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row
just before Terminator reaches it

The car EXPLODES filling the alley with fire An inferno
funneled between the enclosing walls

ANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames
roar over the hood

ON TERMINATOR as he slides to a stop cut off by the
wall of flame

Reese doesnt waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car
Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together

A fresh shirt to hide his body wounds
This is followed by a new overcoat

mirror With the hat pulled down the collar pulled up

storms off

licks her face while she shrieks with laughter

FLEXIBLE CABLE In the sockets of the metal skull the
eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos both glowing

red now

It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA

256 INT MANUFACTURING AREA - NIGHT 256

Kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor Behind them
are acres of machinery in darkness Silence

CRASH The Terminator hits the door from the far side
Hinges SQUEAL

Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it Starts
throwing switches Behind them machines START UP ONE BY ONE

SARAH
(panting)
What are you doing

REESE
(weakly)
Coverour footsteps

He sags sliding down the wall She pulls him up
Half-carries him into the maze of machines

The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING CLANKING SHAPES
SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing
mindlessly

Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to
support him

REESE
(faintly)
Leave me here

Sarah crouches beside him
Grabs his shirt front
Yells over the machines

SARAH
Im not leaving you anywhere
you jerk Havent you figured
it out Kyle John is our
son

Reeses eyes refocus
SARAH
(continuing)
There isnt going to be
anybody elseI dont want
anybody else Listen to
me

She pauses then resumes in a commanding military shout

SARAH
(continuing)
Move Reese Lets go
Move you ass

She drags him to his feet and he staggers on

Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward
The Terminator scans the darkness

ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through
the machines

The cyborg steps forward scanning methodically

Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous
tangle of pipes and machinery Kyle picks up a length of
pipe to use as a weapon As they climb out onto a cat-
walk between the two huge mechanisms Sarah clambers over
an innocuous CONTROL PANEL

Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON

With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams
down an inch from her hand

Startled she tumbles to the catwalk

The Terminators eyes swivel as he hears the single non-
rhythmic sound

Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk but find the
door there locked

SARAH
Come on

They double back to escape the cul-de-sac The Terminator
steps in front of them cutting them off

REESE
(shouting)
Run

He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away
Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator
advances

REESE
(over his
shoulder)
Run damn it

She hesitates backing away

The cyborg swings at Reese

STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL

Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back

ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap smashed against
a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to
the factory floor twenty feet below

Sarah turns and runs
LOW ANGLE PAST REESE FG as the cyborg approaches him
ECU - A FUSE BURNING

CU - KYLES FACE streaked with blood pressed to the
floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN FG His eyes snap open

Sarah falls gets up runs on

The Terminator draws back for a death blow

And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength raising

the pipe bomb he has been cradling He jams it between two
hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborgs armored rib-
cage Then rolls off the catwalk Terminator has an instant
to react reaching for the bomb before it EXPLODES

Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the
floor

Slams up against one wall

A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her
Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory rain-
ing down

CU - SARAH very still She winces and opens her eyes
Slowly looks up

POV - SARAH as the smoke clears The Terminator is GONE
Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about
Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyles

body

LOW ANGLE ON KYLE FG Sarah on catwalk above Kyles eyes
are half-open Still His face peaceful

ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and
triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD It begins to rain

CU - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her
She looks down Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED
PIECE OF METAL Shrapnel Part of the cyborg She pulls
it out grimacing Her leg is broken

It is a long time before she can gather the will to move

SARAHS POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away
beyond the debris from the explosion

She starts to crawl toward it

She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS FG

ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly

Now recognizable as the TERMINATORS HEAD AND ARMS with
half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted
metal

IT LUNGES FOR HER

Sarah wants to scream this time from the depths of her
soul but there is no scream only a dry shivering sob

The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor steel
fingers clutching

Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away
crawling in agony

ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk
onto the MOVING STRIP She is carried into the intricate
lattice of equipment Sarah rolls off weakly before going
under a set of sorting rollers

ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls
after her dragging its body It tracks her unerringly
EYES GLOWING

Sarah moves deeper into the DARK CLASHING JUNGLE of
machinery

Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES PIPES and

unforgiving mechanisms of steel

The Terminator clambers through after her

CU - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches
sight of something A familiar CONTROL BOX

She drags herself toward it

CU - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny
crawl space No way out

It crawls the last few feetEYES RED IN THE DARK
Hypnotized Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER

She is jammed in a corner
Sarahs hand claws around to the front of the control panel
seeking the RED BUTTON

ECU - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON
ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) his steel hand reaching out

ECU - SARAH her face inexplicably calm eyes steady in
that infinite instant She clenches her teeth to keep
from screaming as she WAITS

The Terminators hand reaches for her throat to crush
the life out of her and end its long mission

SARAH
(voice icy)
Youreterminatedfucker

ECU - BUTTON as her bloody finger stabs it down

FULL SHOT showing how the cyborg has been led into the
MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS
THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN

Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminators head
and body like tin-foil The PRESS SCREAMS jamming solid
Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze leaping to surround-
ing machinery arcing to Sarahs wristwatch All the
Terminators energy is released in one second

ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates
a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT

TIGHT ON SARAH shivering uncontrollably The steel fingers
are frozen an inch from her throat She can only stare as
water runs over her

CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP

OUT OF FRAME

WIDE SHOT showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDANTS
past the site of the last explosion
SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris

PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out holding on
TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES FG

cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press
A COP BG notices this

COP

He stands and palms a small object to HIS ASSISTANT They
step around the corner

Sarah is being lifted into the ambulance She looks

up as the doors are latched shut

TILT UP to follow her gaze
The sign above the entrance of the building reads

SARAH (V0O)

and the hardest thing is
deciding what I should tell
you and what not to Well
anyway Ive got a while yet
before youre old enough to
understand the tapes Theyre
more for me at this point
to help get it all straight

COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station All of
its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish Beyond lies an
expanse of scrub desert The sky scowls with an impending
storm

Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
complected attendant laconically fills her tank She
cradles the cassette recorder in her lap in the lee of
her SWOLLEN BELLY

She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG

Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
and the butt of a 357 REVOLVER presses against her
breast She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
her way A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped
boxes and suitcases

SARAH

(continuing)
Should I tell you about your
father Thats a tough one
Will it change your decision
to send him hereknowing
But if you dont send Kyle
you could never be God
you can go crazy thinking
about all thisI suppose
Ill tell youI owe him that
And maybe itll be enough if
you know that in the few hours
we had together we loved a
lifetimes worth

CLICK WHIR Sarah jumps at a sound nearby breaking
her reverie A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture
with a beat-up Polaroid camera He holds it out to her
speaking rapid Spanish

ATTENDANT
He says you are very beautiful
Senora and he is ashamed to ask
five American dollars for this
picture but if he does not

his father will beat him

SARAH
Thats a pretty good hustle
kid Four Quatro

The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
snapshot develop It is a good photograph of her

the wind lightly ruffling her hair expression thought-
ful slightly sad

We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029
She slips it into her short pocket

ATTENDANT
Mil trescientosfifteen dollars
American

As she pays him distant thunder rolls
The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off

SARAH
What did he say

ATTENDANT

(accented)
There is a storm coming in

Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
desert Heat lightning pulses in their depths

SARAH
(quietly)
I know

CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away driving across the
flat desert on a ribbon of highway A brilliant flash
crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
world
