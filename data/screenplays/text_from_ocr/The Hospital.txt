CRASHING SCREAMING Traffic HONKS and BRAYS up First

It is a cold spring morning -- 1000 AM
A 1966 station wagon pulls up to the Holly Pavilion
A tiny fragile white-bearded OLD MAN almost lost in
overcoat is helped from the rear of a station wagon
slowly led to the entrance doors by a middle-aged
NARRATOR
On Monday morning a patient named
Guernsey male middle-seventies was
admitted to the hospital complaining
of chest pains

HOLLY PAVILION EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

The old man is now in a wheelchair pushed by a hospital
orderly down the corridor

NARRATOR

He had been referred by a nursing

home where the doctor had diagnosed

his condition as angina pectoris

Now it is axiomatic that nursing

home doctors are always wrong
ROOM 806
The old man shirtless is propped on the edge of the
wheezing DR SCHAEFER a young intern in white-
perches beside him with the old mans chart in his lap
down his history The other patient in the two-bedded
a MIDDLE-AGED MAN is comatose and all rigged up with

and catheters

NARRATOR
The intern who admitted Mr Guernsey
however accepted the diagnosis and
prescribed morphine a drug suitable
for angina but not at all suitable
for emphysema which is
unfortunately what the old man
actually had Within an hour

EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Two orderlies rush the old mans bed with of course

the
old man in it past the Nurses Station and into a
waiting
elevator
NARRATOR
the patient became unresponsive
and diaphoretic and was raced up to
Intensive Care with an irregular
pulse of 150 blood pressure 90 over
60 respiration rapid and shallow
INTENSIVE CARE
An oxygen mask is applied to the old mans face by the
resident
NARRATOR
The resident on duty now compounded
the blunder by treating the old man
for pulmonary edema He gave him
digitalis diuretics and oxygen
This restored the old mans color
EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR
The elevator door opens Two orderlies wheel the
sleeping
man on his bed back around the Nurses Station and down
the

corridor to his room

NARRATOR
and he was sent back to his room
in the Holly Pavilion ruddy
complected and peacefully asleep

ROOM 806 EVENING

The old man is back in his room sleeping serenely his
tiny
body making barely a ripple in the white sheet that

covers
him The room is in hushed shadows A yellowish light
diffuses
into the room from the half-opened bathroom door The
other
patient in the room remains as before comatose and
silent
NARRATOR
In point of fact the patient was in
CO2 narcosis
ROOM 806
All the lights are on now NURSE PENNY CANDUSO and an
orderly
are wrapping the old man in a post-mortem shroud
BRUBAKER
the senior resident is giving hell to Schaefer the
intern
NARRATOR
and died at seven-thirty that
evening
The shrouded body of the old man is wheeled out of the
room
CAMERA STAYS on the vacated bed
NARRATOR
I mention all this only to explain
how the bed in Room 806 became
available
PAN from bed to Schaefer now alone in the room and
regarding
the empty bed with frowning interest Schaefer is a
scraggly
young fellow bespectacled with a contemporary mess of
hair

and a swinging unkempt moustachio HOLD on Schaefer

NARRATOR
The intern involved was a prickly
young buck named Schaefer who had a
good thing going for him with a
technician in the hematology lab In
the haphazard fashion of hospital
romances Dr Schaefer had been
zapping this girl on wheelchairs

Dr Schaefer moves for the phone on the table between
two beds

in the kitchen in the morgue in
the dark corners of corridors
Schaefer speaks softly into the phone
NARRATOR
Standing up sitting down -- so
you can imagine what an available
bed meant to him

A cold gray light cheerlessly illuminates the room
Perez checks the IV on the comatose patient who is in
bed nearest the door Then she turns to regard the
which gives her pause

NURSES POV Intern Dr Schaefer is lying on this
rigid eyes dilated pupils staring unseeing An IV
sticks out of his naked right arm Nurse Perez doesnt
know what to make of the fact that Dr Schaefer is

Doctor Schaefer
There is of course no response A terrible suspicion
Nurse Perezs mind and she closes her eyes and sighs a
shuddering sigh Then she opens her eyes and with a
and briefer sigh reaches for Schaefers neck to take
pulse Clearly the result is not encouraging She
another short sigh and regards Schaefers unblinking
pupils Its all a bit too much for her she shuffles
window and stares out into the gray morning where
a little more comprehensible Once again she returns
bed regards Schaefers death mask She raises the

and for one short but appreciative moment considers
Schaefers naked body She lets the bedsheet carefully

She sighs again

HOSPITAL HOLLY PAVILION EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

Early-arriving secretaries chat in the doorways The
corridor
itself connects to the Bryce Pavilion (pediatrics

slow to

a halt to continue their chat by a wall

Dr Bock senior resident Brubaker turns the rounds
Biegelman and joins Bock just outside 806
BRUBAKER
(as he approaches
rolls his eyes)
Oh boy

BOCK
What happened

BRUBAKER
Ive seen some pretty good snafus
but this one I mean theres a

certain splendor to this one One of
the night nurses a float thought
Schaefer was a patient and plugged
an IV into him He was a diabetic
you know

BOCK
What do you mean a nurse plugged an
IV into him
BRUBAKER
Oh its really a screwed-up story
Doctor You see what happened was
we had an old man in that bed who
died last night so the bed was
available And you know Schaefer
Hes Sammy Stud

BOCK
And he talked a nurse into zapping
him on that bed

BRUBAKER
I think it was a girl from hematology
hes been running with

BOCK
My God its a Roman farce

The door to Room 806 opens and an Assistant

Administrator
named HITCHCOCK pokes his head out
HITCHCOCK
I thought I heard you out here
Doctor
(he too rolls his
eyes heavenward in
an expression of
incredulity)
Bock makes a noise and goes into
ROOM 806
Aside from Hitchcock the room includes MRS CHRISTIE
the
Director of Nurses a fusty forty-six in
streetclothes
Head Night Nurse Mrs Reardon in uniform Head
Evening
Nurse MRS DUNNE mid-fifties who had apparently been
called
in from home because shes in mufti and wearing a
winter
coat and of course the comatose patient and the dead
Dr

Schaefer Mrs Christie is instructing the two nurses

MRS CHRISTIE
Ill need one from both of you three
copies and I suggest you do that
right now The forms are in my
office

Mrs Dunne on the verge of tears head bobbing looks
up to
Bock

MRS DUNNE
Im really so terribly sorry about
this Dr Bock I

BOCK
(regarding Schaefers
rigid death mask)
As I understand it one of the nurses
inadvertently administered an IV
to Schaefer here How the hell could
that happen

HITCHCOCK
Listen I think we ought to straighten
this out somewhere else

MRS CHRISTIE
Yes very good idea Oh God what a
mess

They all file out now Bock in the rear into
HALLWAY NURSES STATION AND LOBBY AREA

They all go along to the Nurses Station where Mrs
Reardon

and Mrs Dunne disappear into the rooms behind Mrs
Christie

leads Hitchcock and the trailing Bock to the TV-
solarium

but Dr Brubaker is now holding his rounds there He
stands

quietly expounding on the uses of heparin a
decoagulant

One of the patients last night had hemorrhaged
consequent to

injudicious use of that drug Listening the other

young
doctors make notes Mrs Christie leans against the
wall
Apparently the conference is to take place in the
corridor

Background activity continues normally
MRS CHRISTIE
(with a sigh)
Well these things happen of course

HITCHCOCK
I suppose Id better call the Medical
Examiner

BOCK

I still dont know what happened

MRS CHRISTIE
Well it took an hour to get it sorted
out It seems a patient named Guernsey
died last night in Eight-O-Six but
that information wasnt given to the
night nurses These things happen

Bock has begun to get the drift A curious state of
apathy
settles over him

MRS CHRISTIE

(rattling on)
At any rate according to the cardex
the patient Guernsey was down for
twenty-five milligrams of Sparine Q-
6-H so Mrs Reardon sent Nurse Perez
to give him his twelve oclock shot
Meanwhile it seems Dr Schaefer had
usurped that particular bed for his
own purposes Dr Brubaker suggests
it was for a love tryst and some
weight is given that hypothesis by
the fact that Dr Schaefer was naked

BOCK

(trying to give his

attention to this)
I get the drift Mrs Christie In
other words Nurse Perez went in and
sedated Dr Schaefer thinking it was
the patient Guernsey My God What I
dont understand

MRS CHRISTIE
If I may finish Doctor Well after
Perez gave him his shot she noticed
the IV on the bed had been pinched
off and she reported that back to
Mrs Reardon who then assigned Nurse
Rivers to restart the IV
(Bock sighs)
Now Rivers was a float She didnt
even know the staff people on the
floor and nobody knew what the
patient Guernsey looked like anyway
since hed only been admitted that
morning

BOCK
So she plugged an IV into him

MRS CHRISTIE
Yes

BOCK
How much

MRS CHRISTIE
A liter

BOCK

(The doctor in him

intrudes into his

lassitude)
A five percent glucose solution wont
ill anybody Did he have any other
ancillary conditions He wasnt
dehydrated was he Didnt anybody
bother to go in to check him during
the night even under the impression
he was merely a patient Was he
hyperasthmolic Did he have a bad
heart He must have had some kind of
thrombosis I want the post done
here Mr Hitchcock And you and I
better have a little chat Mrs
Christie about your excessive use
of float nurses

MRS CHRISTIE
Ive got nearly a thousand nurses in
this hospital

BOCK
(gathering rage)

And every time one of them has her
period she disappears for three
days My doctors complain regularly
they cant find the same nurse on
the same floor two days in a row
What the hell am I supposed to tell
that boy Schaefers parents That a
substitute nurse assassinated him
because she couldnt tell the doctors
from the patients on the floor My
God the incompetence here is
absolutely radiant I mean two
separate nurses walk into a room
stick needles into a man -- and one
of those was a number eighteen jelco --
tourniquet the poor sonofabitch
anchor the poor sonofabitchs arm
with adhesive tape and its the
wrong poor sonofabitch I mean my
God Where do you train your nurses
Mrs Christie Dachau

(he is aware his voice

has risen and is

attracting attention

He lowers his voice)
All right wrap him up and get him
down to Pathology Im especially
interested in his blood sugar A
liter of glucose never killed anybody
Your ladies mustve done something
else to him

MRS CHRISTIE
Will there be anything else Doctor

BOCK
No

HITCHCOCK
Before you call the family Doctor
I wish youd talk to Mr Mead about
this Wed like naturally to avoid
litigation
Bock heads abruptly down the corridor to the elevators

MRS CUSHING
Are you Mitgang

She gets no answer from that bed From another
voice

MITGANG

ACROSS to Bock coming out of the TV room followed by
dozen young doctors Bock is in very good spirits
indeed He
quizzes his young doctors en route

I wonder if there might not be some
correlation between hepatic
tuberculosis and drug addiction
Presumably there was an early
consideration of SBE

Well dont worry about it There

BIEGELMAN

Not you Biegelman Ambler

AMBLER
Well theres about a seventy percent

incidence of false-positive latex in

Bock They confer quietly in the hallway

BRUBAKER
Weve got a little thing over here
Doctor The girl over there is the
daughter of the patient in Eight-O-
Six He is at the moment comatose

meds

The elevator comes and goes disgorging some taking on
others Bock who greeted Brubaker with a rare benign
the

has begun to look a bit sodden Poor Brubaker

aware of

gathering storm in Bocks demeanor sighs and continues

regardless

BRUBAKER
The thing is the daughter wants to
take the father out of the hospital
and back to Mexico where they live
The patients name is Drummond Hes
apparently a Methodist missionary
and he and his daughter run some
kind of religious mission among the
Apache Indians The daughter claims
to be a licensed nurse so she can
give the necessary IV treatment I
certainly dont think he should be
let out of this hospital The
Attending -- hes the guy in gray
over there -- concurs

Bock squints at Brubaker

BOCK
All right wait a minute Let me
have all that again

BRUBAKER
As a matter of fact Doctor this is
Dr Biegelmans case

BOCK
Never mind the professional ethics
what happened

BRUBAKER

(sighs)
I dont know why Im covering for
that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion
anyway

(sighs and begins)
The patient a man of fifty-six was
admitted to the hospital ten days
ago for a check-up in good health
no visible distress We did the
mandatory work-up on him Blood
cultures stool LE preps chest
EKG all negative But there was
apparently some evidence of protein
in his urine I dont know how that
sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion ever
found out about it Maybe he had
some kind of deal with one of the
girls in the lab Anyway he turned
up the next day conned the patient
into signing an authorization for a
biopsy

BOCK
What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion

BRUBAKER
Some post-grad fellow named Ives
Elroy Ives I never met him Hes on
one of the immunology research
programs

BOCK
Are you trying to tell me some post-
grad fellow came up here and did a
biopsy on the patient

BRUBAKER
Yes sir He conned Biegelman with
that old story about

BOCK
protein in the urine

BRUBAKER
Yes sir

BOCK
And he biopsied the man

BRUBAKER
And he nicked a vessel and at two
oclock in the morning they woke up
Biegelman because the nurse found
the patient in shock Biegelman called
the kidney people for a consult right
away What was there to see The man
was sour and bleeding We spoke to
this fellow Sutcliffe and he referred
us to a surgeon named Welbeck

BOCK
Welbeck That barber

BRUBAKER
You aint heard nothing yet So we
finally got Welbeck around four in
the morning He said go ahead So
they laid on the surgery for eight
Welbeck turns up half-stoned orders
an IVP clears him for allergies

BOCK
without actually testing

BRUBAKER
Right

BOCK
And the patient went into shock

BRUBAKER
and tubular necrosis They lopped
out the bleeding kidney ran him
back to the room and we sat around
waiting for three days to see how
obstructed he was Fever began spiking
like hell euremia vomiting so we
arranged hemodialysis Hes putting
out good water now But some nurse
goofed on his last treatment A leak
in the tube something His blood
pressure plunged They ran him right
up to ICU checked out vital signs
all normal except hes comatose
That was two days ago

BOCK
In short a man came into this
hospital in perfectly good health
and in the space of one week we
chopped out one kidney damaged the
other reduced him to coma and damn
near killed him

BRUBAKER
Yes sir

A great sad serenity has settled over Bock

BOCK
You know Brubaker last night I sat
in my hotel room reviewing the
shambles of my life and contemplating
suicide Then I said No Bock dont
do it Youre a doctor a healer
Youre the Chief of Medicine at one
of the great hospitals of the world
Youre a necessary person Your life
is meaningful Then I came in this
morning and find out one of my doctors
was killed by a couple of nurses who
mistook him for a patient because he
screwed a technician from the
nephrology lab

BRUBAKER
Hematology sir

BOCK
And now you come to me with this
gothic horror story in which the
entire machinery of modern medicine
has apparently conspired to destroy
one lousy patient How am I to sustain
my feeling of meaningfulness in the
face of this You know Brubaker if
there was an oven around Id stick
my head in it What was the name of
that sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion
again

BRUBAKER
Ives sir Elroy Ives Somebody ought

to ream his ass

The gathering storm erupts Rage suffuses Bocks face

Out

of respect for the hospital corridor and the people
working

around him and Brubaker he keeps it glacial But there
is

no mistaking the volcanic fury he feels

BOCK

(barely containing

himself)
Im going to ream his ass And Im
going to break that barber Welbecks
back Im going to defrock those two
cannibals They wont practice in my
hospital Ill tell you that

says we have no legal right to stop
her from taking her father out Shes

Bock Lagerman and Hitchcock have gathered across the

figure of Dr Ives on a stretcher We are in the lab

of Pathology in the background through the glass
the door separating the lab from the surgery room
see the autopsy on Dr Schaefer being performed

Schaefers naked white cadaver is stretched out on
operating table He has been opened up and all his

organs are being excised Its bloody The autopsy

part

we

an

is

performed by DR BREWSTER the Resident in Pathology

in surgical scrub

HITCHCOCK
and the next thing anybody knew
about three hours later Mrs Cushing
from Accounting came in and said
there was a dead man in the Holding
Room

BOCK
You dont find anything grotesque
about all this

HITCHCOCK
What do you mean
BOCK
I mean at half past eight this
morning we meet over a doctor whos
been killed intravenously and here
we are again four hours later with
another doctor who had a heart attack
in the Emergency Room

HITCHCOCK

Well whatre you suggesting Doctor
Do you think we have a mad killer
stalking the halls of the hospital
Presumably Dr Ives died of a heart
attack and Schaefer in a diabetic
coma People do die of these things
Its all perhaps coincidental but I
dont think Id call it grotesque

BOCK
How long are they going to be on
Schaefers post

He knocks on the glass window of the door separating

the
laboratory from the operating room Dr Brewster turns
from
his gory chore Bock makes a gesture saying How much
longer Brewster raises ten blood-drenched rubber-
gloved
fingers Bock turns and shuffles across the lab for the
door
out
BOCK
(pauses at door to
Lagerman)

I dont suppose youd like to call
next of kin

DR LAGERMAN
No thanks

BOCK

Oh God I need a drink

Dark sleeping The bathroom light is on but only a
stream of yellow light trickles through the door

entirely curtained off Nurse Devine sets her tray on
bedtable turns on the goose-neck lamp keeping it from
eyes She unwraps the hypodermic syringe sets in the

Mead by the shoulder
NURSE DEVINE
(softly)

Mr Mead Mr Mead I have an

Mead sleeps on Expressionlessly Nurse Devine extracts
right arm from under the sheets wets a swab with

OVER THIS we begin to hear a distant sibilant HISSING
indistinct like the leakage of a bad heart There is

occasional distinctly human but not quite civilized

CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to Nurse Devine withdrawing

sounds They emanate from behind the curtains of the
bed Nurse Devine returns the syringe to the tray

NURSE DEVINES POV THE INDIAN AND BARBARA DRUMMOND
OVER DRUMMOND PERFORMING SOME PAGAN RITUAL THE HISSING
BARBARAS CONTRIBUTION TO THE CEREMONY (IT SOUNDS LIKE
PIS AND IS IN FACT AN IMITATION OF THE NIGHTHAWK
APPEASE THE SPIRIT OF THE THUNDER)

The old Indian has stripped to the waist and marked his
with smears of dye and tule pollen He wears a

hat a sort of beaded beanie He holds a small buckskin
of pollen in his cupped palms and is facing north
south and west offering the bag and prayers under his
as he does A beaded amulet lies stretched across the
sheet covering the comatose Drummond

When Nurse Devine draws the curtains Barbara frowns at
Devine holds a cautioning finger to her lips and draws
curtains closed again Nurse Devine carrying her

tray exits

EIGHTH FLOOR NURSES STATION

Bock comes out of the elevator jacketed now fairly
but holding it well

He heads for the Nurses Station as Nurse Devine comes

the west corridor Bock grunts at Mrs Dunne and goes

PHARMACY

where he quickly runs his finger along the second
filches

through

to

pharmacy

corridor

ata

slips

until he comes to the bottle of potassium which he
off the shelf and slips into his pocket He rummages

the drawers for a hypodermic syringe Through the open
doorway we see Nurse Devine making her way swiftly up

Mrs Dunne at the desk

NURSE DEVINE
Well honey we got a witch-doctor
in Eight-O-Six and you better go in
there You know that Indian that was
sitting in Eight-O-Six all night
Hes still there and the girls
there and theyre doing some voodoo
in there and I aint kidding

Behind Mrs Dunne Bock appears in the doorway to the
where he stands listening

MRS DUNNE
(looking up)
What are you talking about

NURSE DEVINE
I mean that Indians in there half-
naked and going pis-pis-pis with a
little bag You just better get in
there Mrs Dunne

Mrs Dunne annoyed gets up and heads for the west
followed by Nurse Devine and by an intrigued Dr Bock
few paces behind

NURSE DEVINE
(to NURSE WEITZENBAUM
coming out of another
room)
You want to see somethin baby You
jus come here

As the small procession bears down Barbara Drummond
out of that room to intercept them
BARBARA

(keeping her voice
low)
Look its a perfectly harmless
ceremony nothing to get excited
about Itll be over in a few minutes
anyway Mr Blacktree is a shaman
who gets his power from the thunder
and its imperative he conclude his
rituals while the storm is still
going on

NURSE DUNNE
Visiting hours were over at nine
oclock Miss

Bock reaches for the door to the room
BARBARA
All thats going on in there Doctor
is a simple Apache prayer for my

fathers recovery

Bock makes a vague noise neither contradicting her nor
assenting and continues around her into

ROOM 806

As Bock slides in a bit of the corridor light comes in

with

him The curtains have been left sufficiently open to
reveal

Mr Blacktree He is still stripped to the waist and
marked

with crosses of pollen He extends two twigs to the
four

directions after which he places the twigs carefully on
the

white sheet covering Drummond in a pattern around the
amulet

already there Behind Bock Mrs Dunne can be seen
peeking

in The Indian is oblivious to both of them Bock
watches it

all with interest for a moment and then backs out
into

EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR
closing the door after him

BARBARA
The markings hes made on my fathers
arms are from the pollen of the tule
plant The twigs have no significance
other than theyve been struck by
lightning and are consequently appeals
to the spirit of lightning Its all
entirely harmless a religious
ceremony not a medical one

BOCK
You dont seriously believe all that
mumbo-jumbo will cure him

BARBARA
On the other hand it wont kill
him Doctor

They regard each other levelly
BOCK
(grunts)
Okay Go ahead

He wheels and clumps off for the stairway exit

BARBARA
Thank you

Nurse Weitzenbaum opens the door of the room and peeks

in
At the stairway exit Bock pauses to look back at all
the
women in front of Room 806
BOCK
Miss Drummond are you still taking
your father out
BARBARA
Yes I still have to arrange an
ambulance service Is there a phone
around I could use
BOCK
Use my office

The room is dark and hushed again Blacktree lights his
cigarette and sends the smoke up a ritual which

of puffing smoke to each of the four directions

in Apache May all be well after each puff

CAMERA SLOWLY PANS to the other bed where William Mead
fitfully The Apache words and pis-pis-pis penetrate
drugged sleep He opens one eyelid and stares glazedly
the dark air The SOUNDS persist Blacktree chooses
moment to sidle out from behind the curtains and

his ritual in the less-confined space at the head of
Drummonds bed Its quite a sight for a nervous

man to wake to Thunder RUMBLES and the rain SLASHES
sudden savage STREAK of lightning illuminates it all
Mead figures its all a bad dream and after a moment
dully regarding the odd spectacle closes his one eye
goes back to sleep

BOCKS OFFICE OUTER OFFICE

Barbara Drummond comes in Bock has apparently turned
lights on for her but Bock himself is not immediately
visible She looks through the half-open door to Bocks
private office and there he is staring blankly at the

bottle Barbara starts to say something thinks better

it lays down her coat and looking around spots a
classified directory which she hauls up from its shelf

and
sets on Miss Lebows desk She sits quickly flips
through
the pages
Barbara flips through the directory Bock is partially
visible
in the background at his desk He sits soddenly
Barbara
finds what she wants opens her purse and takes out two
airplane tickets She dials The CLICKING of the dial
catches
Bocks ear He looks up for a moment
BARBARA
(on phone)
Hello Id like to arrange an
ambulance for one-thirty tomorrow
afternoon Thank you
REVERSE ACROSS Bock at his desk with Barbara partially
visible
at Miss Lebows desk All he can see are her great long
tanned
legs
BARBARA
(in background on
phone)
Drummond first name Barbara
Ill pay cash
Bock stands a little unsteadily and moves around his
desk to
get a better look at those legs
BARBARA
(on phone)
No youre to pick up my father
Drummond Edward at the Manhattan
Medical Center Holly Pavilion Room
Eight-O-Six Its a stretcher case
I presume you provide the stretcher
She senses Bock watching her turns smiles Shes a
very

beautiful girl She returns to the phone

BARBARA
Hes to be taken to American Airlines
Yes No Kennedy Airport Flight
Seven-Two-Nine to Yuma Arizona
Ill accompany the patient Yes
thank you

She returns the receiver to its cradle When she looks

up
again Bock is no longer there She returns the flight
tickets
to her purse snaps it shut stands and moves to the
doorway
enters a step into
BOCKS OFFICE
Bock back at his desk looks up
BOCK
You believe in witchcraft Miss
Drummond
BARBARA
I believe in everything Doctor
BOCK
Like a drink
BARBARA
Yes
Bock drains his glass and pours her a hefty shot of
bourbon

BARBARA

(from the door suddenly)
My father you should know was a
very successful doctor in Boston a
member of the Harvard Medical Faculty
He was a widower and I was his only
child He was not an especially
religious man a sober Methodist
One evening seven years ago he
attended a Pentecostal meeting in
the commons rooms at Harvard and
suddenly found himself speaking in
tongues

(she takes her drink

and crosses to the

sofa)
That is to say he suddenly sank to
his knees at the back of the room
and began to talk fluently ina
language which no one had ever heard
before This sort of thing happens
frequently at Pentecostal meetings
and they began to happen regularly
to my father

(she sits)
It was not unusual to walk into our
home and find my father sitting in
his office utterly serene and happily
speaking to the air in this strange
foreign tongue I was at that time
twenty years old and having my
obligatory affair with a minority
group in my case a Hopi Indian a
post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing
his doctorate in the aboriginal
languages of the Southwest One day
I brought the Indian boy home just
as my father was sinking to his knees
in the entrance foyer in one of his
trances The Indian wheeled in his
tracks and said Well Ill be a
sonofabitch You see my father was
speaking an Apache dialect an obscure
dialect at that spoken only by a
ragged band of unreconstructed Indians
who had rejected the reservation and
were living in total isolation in
the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern
Mexico Well What do you say to
that Dr Bock

BOCK
(who has been staring
at her as if she
were insane)
What the hell am I supposed to say
to that Miss Drummond

Barbara throws back her head and roars with laughter

BOCK
Im sitting here boozing and all of
a sudden you start telling me some
demented story about your fathers
religious conversion

BARBARA
No no you miss the point Doctor
Not my fathers conversion -- mine

You see I had been hitting the acid
pretty regularly at that time I had
achieved a few minor sensory
deformities some suicidal despairs
but nothing as wild as fluency in an
obscure Apache dialect I mean like
wow man I mean here was living
afflatus right before my eyes Within
a week my father had closed his
Beacon Hill practice and set out to
start a mission in the Mexican
mountains And I turned in my SDS
card and my crash helmet and followed
him It was a disaster at least for
me My father had received the
revelation not I He stood gaunt on
a mountain slope and preached the
apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians
I masturbated a great deal We lived
in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit
and crushed pifion nuts It was
hideous Within two months I was
back in Boston a hollow shell and
dizzy with dengue disenchanted with
everything I turned to austerity
combed my hair tight and entered
nursing school I became haggard
driven and had shamelessly incestuous
dreams about my father I took up
with some of the senior staff at the
hospital One of them a portly
psychiatrist explained I was
generated by an unresolved lust for
my father I apparently cracked up
One day they found me walking to
work naked and screaming obscenities
There was talk of institutionalizing
me so I packed a bag and went back
to my father in the Sierra Madre
Mountains Ive been there ever since
Thats three years My father is of
course mad as a hatter I watch

over him and have been curiously
content You see Doctor I believe
in everything

She pauses her story over Throughout Bock has been

trying

to keep his glowering eye on the desktop During her
long

narrative he once seized the bottle and took a swig
Mostly

he is finding the experience murkily sensual His
glance
keeps darting out from under his brows to
surreptitiously

look at the beautiful long tanned legs or when she
bends

for the drink she set on the floor to peer down the
flapping

open scalloped neck of her dress she is bra-less

She on the other hand has been crossing and
uncrossing her

legs bending stretching so that her short dress has
ridden

up almost to her waist and is saved from utter
exhibitionism

only by the darkness of the shadows She seems
unaffected by

Bocks voyeuristic interest in her but she is surely
not

unaware of it It is hard to believe she is not
courting his

attention
BOCK
Now what was that all about Miss
Drummond
BARBARA

I thought I was obvious as hell Im
trying to tell you I have a thing
for middle-aged men

BOCK
I admire your candor

BARBARA
Youve been admiring a lot more than
that

Bock looks up and they suddenly find their eyes
locked The

dark dense air in the room fairly steams with
incipient

sexuality

BOCK
(looks down again)
Youre wasting your time Ive been
impotent for years

BARBARA
Rubbish
With a crash of his fist on the desktop Bock stands
he is
in a drunken rage

BOCK

(lurches about)
What the hells wrong with being
impotent My God you kids are more
hung up on sex than the Victorians
ve got a son twenty-three I threw
him out of the house last year
Pietistic little humbug He preached
universal love and despised everyone
He had a blanket contempt for the
middle class even its decencies He
detested my mother because she had
petit bourgeois pride in her son the
doctor I cannot tell you how
brutishly he ignored that rather
good old lady When she died he
didnt even come to the funeral He
thought the chapel service an
hypocrisy His generation didnt
live with lies he told me Everybody
lives with lies I said I grabbed
him by his poncho dragged him the
full length of our seven-room
despicably affluent middle-class
apartment and flung him out I havent
seen him since But do you know what
he said to me as he stood there on
that landing on the verge of tears
He shrieked at me You old fink
You cant even get it up anymore
That was it you see That was his
real revolution It wasnt racism
and the oppressed poor and the war
in Vietnam The ultimate American
societal sickness was a limp dingus
Hah

(he lurches about

laughing rustily)
My God if there is a despised and
misunderstood minority in this
country its us poor impotent
bastards Well Im impotent and
proud of it Impotence is beautiful
baby

(he raises a militant

fist)
Power to the Impotent Right on
baby
BARBARA
(smiling)
Right on

BOCK

(stares drunkenly at

her)
When I say impotent I dont mean
merely limp Disagreeable as it may
be for a woman a man may sometimes
lust for other things something
less transient than an erection
some sense of permanent worth Thats
what medicine was for me my reason
for being When I was thirty-four
Miss Drummond I presented a paper
before the annual convention of the
Society of Clinical Investigation
that pioneered the whole goddam field
of immunology A breakthrough Im
in all the textbooks I happen to be
an eminent man Miss Drummond And
you want to know something Miss
Drummond I dont give a goddam
When I say Im impotent I mean Ive
lost even my desire for work which
is a hell of a lot more primal a
passion than sex Ive lost my raison
detre my purpose the only thing I
ever truly loved Its all rubbish
anyway Transplants antibodies we
manufacture genes we can produce
birth ectogenetically we can
practically clone people like carrots
and half the kids in this ghetto
havent even been inoculated for
polio We have assembled the most
enormous medical establishment ever
conceived and people are sicker
than ever We cure nothing We heal
nothing The whole goddam wretched
world is strangulating in front of
our eyes Thats what I mean when I
say impotent You dont know what
the hell Im talking about do you

BARBARA
Of course I do

BOCK
Im tired Im terribly tired Miss
Drummond And I hurt and Ive got
nothing going for me anymore Can
you understand that

BARBARA
Yes of course

BOCK
Then can you understand that the

only admissable matter left is death

He suspects he is going to cry and turns quickly away

He
sits heavily and fights his tears
BARBARA
Sounds to me like a familiar case of
morbid menopause
BOCK
Oh Christ
BARBARA
Well its hard for me to take your
despair very seriously Doctor You
obviously enjoy it so much
BOCK
Oh bugger off Thats all I need
now Clinical insights Some
cockamamie twenty-five-year-old
BARBARA
Twenty-seven

about menopause now Look Id like
to be alone so why dont you beat

lights on your way out
They are both suddenly conscious of a third presence in
the

clothed
again and carrying his coat is standing in the
doorway

BOCK

Swell Just close the door and turn

off the lights
Barbara regards his hunched form and murmuring in
she exits closing the door In the subsequent hush
RUMBLES and CRASHES Wind sweeps the rain against the
panes
The sounds go unheeded by Bock still as marble
raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his
pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and
takes off his jacket rolling up his shirtsleeve
about for the vein He removes his trouser belt which
ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet Now
tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle
Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket he finally

total rage of the aborted suicide The thunder CRASHES
BOCK
(barely gets the words
out)

She approaches the desk affably turns the potassium
to read the label
BARBARA
Potassium You take enough of this
stuff itll kill you Doc
(moves toward the
couch)
It occurred to me that I might have
read you wrong that you really were
suicidal So I came back
Bocks rage erupts He crashes the hypodermic syringe
shattering it The potassium puddles on the wood
BOCK
(hysterical rage)
Who the hell asked you
He moves around the desk a shambling bear of a man a
belt dangling dementedly from his arm tears coursing

his cheeks He advances on her in a stuperous shuffle

Throughout the scene CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN through
flesh and fury to an INTENSE TWO-SHOT of this terrified
of love Then slowly over Bocks plunging shoulder to
womans face She gasps at the moment of penetration
her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity
sobs even in the shadows we can see the path of the

BOCKS OFFICE DAYBREAK WEDNESDAY

Covered by Bocks overcoat Barbara tosses and turns on
couch in a small nightmare Through the windows comes
first gray wash of dawn FULL SHOT of Barbara awake

on one elbow on the verge of a scream She looks around
room It is dark empty silent

ACROSS Barbara looking through the door to the

office It is likewise dark but suddenly the lights go
and a moment later Bock enters He holds a container
coffee in each hand and has something white draped over
forearm From under Bocks bulky coat Barbara watches

lumber to his desk where he sets the containers of
down He drops the whitish garment over the back of a

chair

and then sits He hoists a bulging folder of
correspondence

from his filing tray and hunches to work reading
After a

moment he regards the silent figure on the couch
across the
room

BOCK
You wouldnt be awake

BARBARA
What time is it

He rises picks up the second container and white dress
from

the chair She reaches out an arm for the coffee Bock
holds

up -- a nurses uniform

BOCK

I swiped this for you out of the
nurses locker room Ill make good
on your dress Im afraid its torn
beyond repair Buy yourself a new
one or if you like give me your
size and Ill send it on to you But
I want to talk to you about that

BARBARA
Talk to me about what

BOCK
About your father You really
shouldnt move him in his condition
I just had a look at his chart
Theres no reason to presume brain
damage You know as well as I you
cant predict anything in these
instances He could pull out of that
coma at any time I think you should
let him stay here Ill personally
look after him

He has perched on the edge of the couch and she rests
her

cheek against the long bent curve of his back
smiling
Is this your way of saying youd
like me to stay in town a few more
days

He turns to look at her smiles back

BOCK
Well that would be nice too

She sips her coffee

BOCK
What do you say Miss Drummond

BARBARA
I expect you can call me Barbara
considering you ravished me three
times last night

BOCK
Three times

BARBARA
Oh look at him pretending he didnt
count You were as puffed up as a
toad about it Punched a couple of
holes in your crusade for universal
impotence didnt it I think were
on a first name basis by now Ill
call you Herb

BOCK
Lets give your father a week
Barbara what do you say

BARBARA

(a frown darkens her

face)
No I dont want my father in this
hospital I had a dream about this
hospital

(some of the terror

shows on her face)
I dreamt this enormous starched white
tile building suddenly erupted like
a volcano and all the patients
doctors nurses attendants
orderlies the whole line staff the
food service people the aged the
lame -- and you right in the middle --
were stampeding in one hideous
screaming suicidal mass into the
sea

(she stares at him

wide-eyed reliving

the dream)
Im taking my father out of here --
and as quickly as I can

They stare at each other she in terror he with
affection

BOCK
Youre a real fruitcake you know

She sets her coffee down on the couch and decides to
wear

Bocks overcoat rather than use it as a cover She
searches

for the sleeves Bock assists her

BARBARA
Well let me put it this way I love
you I fancied you from the first
moment you came lumbering down that
hallway upstairs I said to Mr
Blacktree Whos that hulking bear
of a man The Apaches are reverential
about bears They wont eat bear
meat they never skin bears Bear is
thought of as both benign and evil
but very strong power Men with bear
power are highly respected and are
frequently said to be great healers

By now shes standing the overcoat reaching her toes
She
looks down at Bock perched on the couch

BARBARA
I said to Mr Blacktree That man
gets his power from the bear

BOCK
Swell Now look do you have a hotel
some sort of accommodations where
you can stay for a week or so

Barbara reaches for her coffee sips moves around in
her
tent of a coat

BARBARA
All right let me put it this way
Herb My father and I accept the
implacability of death If he dies
he dies but Im taking him out of
here and back to Mexico about one
oclock this afternoon I want you
to come with us because I love you
and want children

BOCK
Im afraid Mexico sounds a little
too remote for me

BARBARA
We could use you down there you
know Theres a curiously high
incidence of TB And youd be a
doctor again Herb Youd be necessary
again If you love me I dont see
what other choice you have

BOCK
What do you mean if I love you I
raped you in a suicidal rage How
did we get to love and children all
of a sudden

BARBARA
Oh for heavens sake Herb I ought
to know if a man loves me or not
You must have told me half a hundred
times last night you loved me You
murmured it shouted it one time
you opened the window and bellowed
it out into the street

BOCK
I think those were more expressions
of gratitude than love

BARBARA
Gratitude for what

BOCK
Well my God for resurrecting
feelings of life in me I thought
dead

BARBARA
Well my God what do you think love
is

BOCK
Okay I love you and you love me
Im not about to argue with so
relentless a romantic Well then
since we have this great passion
going for us I dont see why you
wont stay on here in New York for a
week or ten days

BARBARA
Its up to ten days now

BOCK
As long as it takes for your fathers
condition to improve

BARBARA
No Ive had these prophetic dreams
for seven nights Seven is a sinister
number The meaning of these dreams
is very clear seven times as clear
I am to get my father and you out of
this hospital before we are all
destroyed

BOCK

(throws up his hands)
Youre certifiable My God half the
time youre a perfectly intelligent
young woman and then suddenly you
turn into a goddam cabalist who
believes in dreams witchcraft and
bear power And I dont like the way
you dismiss my whole life as
unnecessary I do a lot of healing
right here in Manhattan I dont
have to go to Mexico for it I also
teach I send out eighty doctors a
year into the world sometimes
inspirited at least competent Ive
built up one of the best damned
departments of medicine in the world
Weve got a hell of a heart unit
here and a hell of a kidney group A
lot of people come into this hospital
in big trouble Miss Drummond and
go out better for the experience So
dont tell me how unnecessary I am

BARBARA
(whos been slipping
into the nurses
uniform)

Yeah

BOCK
Yeah

BARBARA
So how come eight hours ago you
were trying to kill yourself with an
overdose of potassium

BOCK
Where are you going now

This last in reference to Barbara crossing to the
secretaries’
office zippering her uniform

BOCKS SECRETARIES OFFICE

BARBARA
(gathering her coat
and purse)
My hotel I have to check out Mr
Blacktree doesnt speak any English

BOCK
(from the connecting
doorway)
Well youre coming back of course

BARBARA
Of course I have to settle the bill
here and pack my father And I think
you need a few hours alone to make
your decisions

BOCK
What decisions

BARBARA
Youre a very tired and very damaged
man Youve had a hideous marriage
and I assume a few tacky affairs
along the way Youre understandably
reluctant to get involved again
And on top of that here I am with
the preposterous idea you throw
everything up and go off with me to
some barren mountains of Mexico It
sounds utterly mad I know On the
other hand you obviously find this
world as desolate as I do You did

She slips into her coat and exits as Bock looks after
thoughtfully then turns back to his own office
BOCKS OFFICE
He shuffles around distractedly not knowing how to
the exuberance he feels Suddenly he opens the window
out and bellows to the empty air

All right I love you

Representative of the Hospital a young woman in her

MRS BASSEY

So the hospital has assumed the

terribly
topcoat

of the

responsibility of finding 400 housing
units in good buildings The hospital
wishes to point out that this
particular row of buildings on First

before the hospital acquired
ownership and even then only after
responsible leaders in the community
had approved the building of our new
drug rehabilitation center

SUNDSTROMS OFFICE

SUNDSTROM

(explodes on the phone)
Goddammit Barry Ive got a dozen
community leaders waiting for me in
the library Weve been trying to
work out some kind of negotiable
formula for two years And with no
help from you people in the Urban
Affairs Division I might add

DR WELBECK appears in the doorway Hes in his

gray distinguished and very tanned with terribly
kindly old country doctor eyes He wears a camel hair
He smiles benignly and twinkles at Sundstrom from one
leather chairs across the desk from the Director

SUNDSTROM

(hardly notices Welbeck)
And Im not going to throw all that
down the drain because some cockamamie
activist group is show-boating for
the television cameras You get those
people out of those buildings before
a wall collapses or a fire breaks
out and weve got a riot on our
hands Okay

He hangs up sighs turns to the man across the desk

WELBECK
(smiles twinkles)
Having your troubles eh Well I
wont take much of your time My
names Welbeck Ive been associated
with this hospital for six years

and yesterday afternoon Dr Gilley
called me to say he was cutting off
my privileges at the hospital Do

SUNDSTROM
(glances at his watch)
Its news to me

WELBECK
He said he sent the report on

SUNDSTROM
Ill probably get it tomorrow Report
on what

WELBECK

Well Im not sure myself I dida
nephrectomy on a man about seven
days ago Emergency called in at
four in the morning The man was
hemorrhaging hed gone sour

SUNDSTROM
Welbeck Im terribly sorry but I
do have this meeting

(crosses to the door)

In any event theres nothing I can
do about it If Gilley wants to cut
your privileges hes Chief of
Surgery its within his province
Youll have to have the hearing

He exits followed by Welbeck into the

DIRECTORS SUITE SECRETARIES OFFICES
Buzzing now Typewriters clicking Phones ringing

WELBECK
I have a laparotomy laid on for this
morning I assume Ill be allowed to
go through with that

SUNDSTROM
Of course

WELBECK

Ive been associated with this
hospital for six years
SUNDSTROM
Now now Welbeck It seems to me
Ive had your name down here before
for something
(to his secretary en
passant)
Ill be in the staff room

He and Welbeck pass out into the
EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

Flowing with a normal stream of traffic Sundstrom and
Welbeck

turn right and head down to the last room of the
corridor

Something comes to him and Sundstrom pauses

SUNDSTROM
Wait a minute Youre the fellow
with the Medicaid collecting business
who incorporated and went public
right I mean something like that
Milton Mead was telling me about you
just the other day Youre a whole
medical conglomerate Youve got a
Factoring service a computerized
billing company and a few proprietary
hospitals a few nursing homes Good
heavens Welbeck you shouldnt be
brought up before a committee of
mere doctors You should be
investigated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission Youll have to
go through with the hearing Welbeck
I dont interfere in these things

He opens the door of the staff room and strides in
Even

before he enters we get a blast of angry voices both
male

and female For the moment the door is ajar we see a

WELBECK

(en route to phone)
Since last September If they had
that when I was your age Id have
put away a couple of million by now

(dials)
It gives you a variety of deferral
devices profit-sharing for example
Lets say you pick yourself an October
31-fiscal You declare a bonus payable
in 71 An accrued item payable to a
principle share-holder must be paid
within two and half months after the
close of the year to get the deduction
in the prior year But your
corporation doesnt pay that tax
because weve eliminated the taxable
income with the bonus With two
taxable entities you can bury a
hell of a lot of expenses

(on phone)
Hello this is Welbeck any
messages Well Im at the

hospital I have to cut open some
guy in a couple of minutes Ill try
to make it as fast as I can How
urgent did he say it was Well
Dr Hogan made those arrangements
with the underwriters The
Registration Statement was filed
with the SEC well over a year
ago If he calls again have me
paged here

(hangs up turns back

The really big money is in health
leasing of course Dr Hogan the
eminent orthopedic surgeon and I
incorporated a leasing company and
went public last year I hold a
controlling interest in a number of
proprietary hospitals nursing homes
and rest farms and Ive been leasing
hospital equipment to my own hospitals
at excessive rates Why you ask am
I draining my own hospitals Well
my hospitals are taxed at 48 percent
and Im giving my leasing company a
hell of a price-earnings ratio
whichll balloon the market value of
the stock hold three hundred
thousand shares of that stock
lettered of course but in a year
Ill dump those shares at a capital
gain and walk off with a bundle

Dr Mallory thumps the patients chest hard with his

BOCK
Now I dont want to get into an
institutional hassle with you Mrs
Christie The malpractice here is
monumental As you see Dr Schaefers
blood sugar was twenty-three No
glucose solution is going to do that
The only thing that will do that is
at least fifty units of insulin
probably more The only presumption
is that one of those nurses on the
Eighth Floor shot fifty units of
insulin into Schaefers blood stream
either by injection or through the
IV although how in Gods name

I dont know what happened A patient
named Mangafranni was scheduled for
a hysterectomy at ten oclock -- Dr
Mallory I talked to Sylvia in the
Holding Room who admitted her so
she was here And now I just spoke

abortion The clinic should be
under the supervision and entirely
staffed by women and administered by
a member of the Womens Committee
for Medical Liberation

and by

YOUNG WHITE ACTIVIST
lets get to the core of the matter
which is the criminal and gangster
collusion between the American medical
establishment and the drug insurance
and tobacco companies who through
their combined racketeering efforts
have produced a dual system of health
care Everything for the rich and
nothing for the poor
and by

BLACK PANTHER

for Gods sake Weve got eleven
people in these buildings and weve
got to get them out of there We can
rectify the injustices of the world
tomorrow but right now for Gods
sake can we get those people out of
those buildings Will you people
please listen to me Will you people
please shut up and listen to me
Will you people please call a halt

During this maelstrom the phone at Meads elbow RINGS

Dr Mallory is wrenching off his blood-drenched rubber
and flinging them to the floor in a rage The door to

with Eastern containment blandly gathers his equipment
together nods to Mrs Christie

DR CHU
Good morning

MRS CHRISTIE
Good morning Doctor

DR CHU
This is really something isnt it
I thought she looked a little
different when they brought her in
I even said to one of the nurses
She looks a little younger without
her dentures Id only talked to
her half an hour before

MRS CHRISTIE
Does anybody know who she is

Dr Mallory can only stare at her numbly He turns and
numbly at Mr Sloan

MRS CHRISTIE
(to Mrs Kimball
examining the chart
dangling from the
operating table)
Whats her chart say

CIRCULATING RESIDENT
Her chart says Mangafranni Her
bracelet says Mangafranni The only
thing that isnt Mangafranni is the
woman

Dr Mallory finally explodes

DR MALLORY
Jesus H Christ Ive been chopping
out three uteruses a day for twenty
years and is it too much to expect
for you people to bring in the right
goddam Jesus Christ uterus

DR CHU
I had just been talking to her in
the Holding Room She was perfectly
fine A little drowsy I thought it
was funny that when they brought her
in she was out cold

DR MALLORY
(shuffling around in
aimless circles)
Jesus H Kee-rist

Mrs Christie stares down at the face of the dead
patient on

the table who has had her chest spread wide open so
that

the organs are exposed

MRS CHRISTIE
Well well just all have to stay
here until Mr Mead or someone from
the 00D comes back

BOCK
You mean she was the one

LAGERMAN
Thats the one I just identified

heart attack in Emergency or of
anesthesia shock in an operating
room

Elevator doors open A nurse and visitor get out Bock

Drummond abashed stands there a scolded schoolboy a

rawboned figure in a hospital shift a stethoscope
dangling

from his right hand

BARBARA
(to Bock)
What happened Did he say anything
to you

BOCK

(sufficiently recovered)
As a matter of fact he said I am
the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete
of Caborca And youd better close
the door because if hes going to
tell everyone who walks in here hes
the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete
of Caborca theyll put us all away
Hes already killed two doctors and
one nurse

DRUMMOND
I am the wrath of the lamb and the
angel of the bottomless pit

BARBARA
What do you mean he killed two doctors
and a nurse

BOCK
I mean hes killed two doctors and
a nurse And he just tried to kill
me He has something against doctors
Somehow he got hold of a thousand
units of insulin and put it in Dr
Schaefers intravenous solution And
somehow he got Dr Ives to die of a
heart attack in the middle of the
Emergency Room And somehow he got a
dialysis nurse named Campanella to
die of anesthesia shock on an
operating table

(opens the closet

points to the white

doctors uniform

hanging there)
Hes been running around the hospital
wearing Dr Schaefers uniform Right
now theyre looking all over the
place for this mysterious Dr
Schaefer I know this all sounds as
grotesque to you as it does to me
but you can see for yourself your
father is not the helpless comatose
patient we thought he was Dont
look at me like Im the one whos
crazy Ask your crazy father

DRUMMOND
I was merely an instrument of God I
killed no one They all three died
by their own hands ritual victims
of their own institutions murdered
by irony an eye for an eye biblical
retribution Schaefer was first you
see because he killed God God was
admitted to this hospital last Monday
under the name of Guernsey

ROOM 806 MORNING (FLASHBACK)

A cheerless gray sunlight fills the room as the

fragile

white-haired and bearded old Guernsey (whose admittance
to

the hospital was the opening scene of the film) is
being

helped into the room by Nurse Felicia Chile She
solicitously

helps the wispy old man off with his coat and jacket
and hat

which she puts in the armoire With palsied fingers
the
little old man unknots his stringy tie and unbuttons

the
collar which is three sizes too large In the other
bed
Drummonds eyes slowly open
DRUMMOND
(off-screen)
I was instantly aware of a divine
presence
The old man is slipping out of his clothes to expose a
thin
little body in a torn nightshirt
DRUMMOND
(off-screen)
I was convinced this porcelain old
man was in fact an Angel of the
Lord
The old man sits back wheezing a little Nurse Chile
smiles
nicely at him and takes her leave For a moment
Drummond
lies rigidly on his bed staring dully into the air and
the
old man sits with his hunched back to us The room is
silent
except for his rheumy wheeze
DRUMMOND
(off-screen)
perhaps even Christ Himself
After a moment the old man rises and goes to the
washbasin
and with some wheezing spits into it He shuffles
back to
bed Dr Schaefer comes into the room with a
professional
smile and the patient Guernseys chart
DRUMMOND
(off-screen)
Our Savior was it seems suffering
from emphysema
Schaefer perches on the bed beside Guernsey and begins
to

take his history
opened

down on

voice

hands
intellectual

beard

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)
He was relentlessly subjected to the
benefits of modern medicine He was
misdiagnosed mismedicated and put
into shock by Dr Schaefer raced
off to Intensive Care where the
resident compounded the blunder and
induced a coma I can tell you with
authority that God is indeed dead
He died last Monday under the name
of Guernsey

CLOSE-UP of Drummond in deep shadow shows him sleeping
DRUMMOND
(off-screen)
A few hours later he appeared to me
in a revelation
ROOM 806 NIGHT 700 PM
The room is lit only by the yellow light from the half-

bathroom door Guernsey walks out of the shadows hands
raised He shuffles to Drummonds bedside and looks

him from his frail height
GUERNSEY
(softly)
Rise up Drummond You are dead now

you are restored

Drummonds eyes open and roll to the direction of the

DRUMMONDS POV Guernsey dressed only in his
shift is shuffling up and down the aisle of the room
clasped behind his back like a Mittel-European
head hunched forward -- a little old man with a white
talking to himself
GUERNSEY
Those who killed you and those who
killed me will die in our place You

are the Paraclete of Caborca the
wrath of the lamb The angel of the
imbued
who

into

wheezing
lies

the

of

Drummond
glinting in

tears of

his

shoulders

bottomless pit
Guernsey closes his eyes in religious ecstacy

GUERNSEY
In this fashion has it been revealed
to you

Drummond starts to sob and slowly sits up in his bed
with belief He looks mutely up at the frail old man
now raises his right hand and his face is transfigured
vast majesty
GUERNSEY
(thunders out)

The age is closed The end is at

hand The seal is broken
So saying he reverts to the little old man he was
a bit and with some effort climbs back on his bed and
there eyes closed His thin high nose projects from
whiteness of his face He sighs the rattling last sigh
life and dies CAMERA DOLLIES slowly to CLOSE-UP of
lying motionless on his bed His eyes are wide
the shadows a man imbued His cheeks are wet with
exaltation

DRUMMOND
(off-screen)

Well Not quite the burning bush

perhaps but prodigal enough for me

I was to avenge the death of God and

my own brutalization I was to kill

Doctors Schaefer Ives and Welbeck

and the dialysis nurse Miss

Campanella whose negligence caused

my coma

FULL SHOT of Drummond He raises his left hand flexing

fingers Then he moves his other arm his head his

Obviously he is regaining his faculties

DRUMMOND
(off-screen)
I awaited a further sign from God
which was given to me later that
evening Dr Schaefer it seems had
arranged an assignation with a girl
from the hematology lab named Sheila

ACROSS Drummond to the now empty other bed All the
are on PAN on Nurse Penny Canduso and an orderly
away the wrapped body of Guernsey Intern Schaefer at
door considers the empty bed with interest Moving to
bedtable he picks up the receiver of the phone
SCHAEFER
(on phone)

Hey Sheila this is Howard Sheila

Hey listen I got us a bed for

tonight A real honest-to-god bed
ROOM 806 NIGHT
REPRISE the scene originally played UNDER CREDITS where
Schaefer and his girlfriend Sheila sneak into the room

undress Giggles and shushings gooses and fondles

SHEILA
Boy I sure hope nobody walks in

During the replay however an additional segment is
At one point the girl hanging her dress in the
turns and holds something up

SHEILA
Whats this in your pocket

SCHAEFER
Thats my insulin Put it back

SHEILA
What do you take insulin for

Drummond on his chair Barbara perched on one side of

fathers bed Bock on the other William Mead sleeps

BOCK
And you put Schaefers insulin into
the IV jar

DRUMMOND
Yes And then a second nurse came
and plugged the IV jar into
Schaefer God clearly intended a
measure of irony here The hospital
was to do all the killing for me
All I need do was arrange for the
doctors to become patients in their
own hospital Accordingly the next
morning I set out for Dr Ives I
put on Dr Schaefers uniform pinched
some digoxine from the pharmacy and
a sandbag from a utility cart and
found my way to Dr Ives laboratory
I coshed him with the sandbag gave
him a massive shot of the digoxine
This you see brought on an instant
condition of cardiac arrhythmia

Drummond in his hospital shift gaunt and mad as a
prophet
sits rigidly on his chair Barbara perches on her
fathers

bed Bock wanders disorientedly about the room staring
incredulously first at Barbara and then at her father

DRUMMOND
So last night I coshed Miss
Campanella with a sandbag sedated
her with thorazine shaved her
prepped her and parked her ina
corridor of the X-Ray Department for
five hours

BOCK
Why X-Ray

DRUMMOND
Well at X-Ray a sedated body lying
around unattended for five hours
wouldnt seem unusual

BOCK
Of course

DRUMMOND
Her operation -- that is to say
Mrs Mangafrannis operation -- was
not scheduled until nine-thirty So
at nine-fifteen this morning I rang
for my nurse

BOCK
You rang for your nurse

DRUMMOND
To insure one full hour of
uninterrupted privacy

BOCK
Oh yes

DRUMMOND
I got up wheeled Miss Campanella
off to the operating rooms replaced
her bed with Mrs Mangafrannis
exchanged charts and identity
bracelets She died officially of
anesthesia shock But in point of
fact she died because she was wearing
another womans identity

MRS DONOVAN

Bock immediately emerges from the pharmacy holding a
bottle

of thorazine and a wrapped hypodermic syringe He
scowls at

Welbeck who scowls back

WELBECK
Oh Dr Bock Can I have a few minutes

BOCK
No

He starts to pass Mrs Donovan and would continue but
Welbeck
lays a restraining hand on his arm

WELBECK
Dr Gilley tells me youre the one
who initiated these proceedings
against me

BOCK
Im busy Welbeck

WELBECK
Id like to know what you have against
me

BOCK

You turned up half-stoned for a simple
nephrectomy eight days ago botched
it put the patient into failure and
damn near killed him Then pausing
only to send in your bill you flew
off on the wings of man to an island
of sun in Montego Bay This is the
third time in two years weve had to
patch up your patients the other
two died Youre greedy unfeeling
inept indifferent self-inflating
and unconscionably profitable Aside

from that I have nothing against
you Im sure you play a hell of a
game of golf What else do you want
to know

Welbecks pocket-beeper BEEPS

WELBECK

Excuse me for a moment Doctor

nurses desk for a

cold scorn)

Bock turns and heads back for

empty

Bock nods to Milton Mead and Hitchcock who nod back
and
crosses quickly to look into the bathroom which is
likewise
empty

WILLIAM MEAD
