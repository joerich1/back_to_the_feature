Opposite Cleere is Tom Shaw
CLEERE
I want to be clear -- I haven’t

accused him of anything

SHAW
I understand
CLEERE
I just I see the attention he’s

getting it’s the KIND of
attention he was always seeking
here when he was harassing
students pulling people over on
the highway Crazy behavior And
I decided if my fears were correct
-- if he WASN’T actually the hero
they’re makin’ him out to be --
and I’d had information pertinent
to that fact which I’d failed to
bring to light It could
jeopardize lives

SHAW
Dr Cleere you did the right
thing calling And we will look
into it

Ten other SENIOR FBI GUYS (and Tom Shaw) in here An
ERASURE BOARD reads “CENTBOM” Tension pressure

BRUCE HUGHES
Okay I want to hear more about
Jewell Patrick

All eyes on PATRICK WILLIAMS from the Behavioral Sciences
Team --

WILLIAMS
When I look at Jewell I think
about the bomb scare at the LA
Olympics in ‘84 a bag left ona
bus by the same cop who then
discovered it And the fires in
Idaho this summer -- started by a
firefighter who wanted the credit
for putting them out There is a
profile that emerges the false
hero

Tom Shaw believes that to his core The whole room does

WILLIAMS
In interviews Jewell’s account of
the bombing seems vague and he
looks uncomfortable discussing the
victims I also found his
mentioning on TV that he was
hoping to get back into law
enforcement a bit inappropriate
There’s a lot here that’s
troubling And everything Agent
Shaw has learned about him does
sync-up with this profile

BRUCE HUGHES
You agree with that Tom

SHAW
I do sir

Bruce Hughes digests that Then

BRUCE HUGHES
Let’s put eyes on him

What do you think of the manner in
which the FBI has treated your

I think whoever the bum was who
leaked that Richard Jewell was the
focus of this investigation should
be prosecuted or dealt with in
some serious way I don’t think
that this investigation should be
aaahhh conducted under world
spotlight like this

GUMBEL
Why are you so convinced of his
innocence

BRYANT
Because I’ve known Richard for a
while I’ve looked him in the eye
and I’ve asked him the question

Were you aware that he had been
arrested in the past for
impersonating an officer

Oh I used to work a lot of car
wrecks when I was in the sheriffs
office Sometimes there’d be kids
involved and they’d always be
scared So I kept Teddy bears in
my trunk to calm ‘em down Just
became a habit

keeps knocking on Bobi’s door --

JEWELL

Bobi opens the door her eyes wet The room goes SILENT
save for the sound of that Goddamn HELICOPTER overhead

BOBI
Richard I’m scared

JEWELL
Me too Momma

BOBI
I don’t know how to protect you
from these people

He grabs her and hangs on Bobi crying

Bryant and Nadya are across the room Jewell eyes them
while still embracing his mother

JEWELL

THREE DAYS to be proud of her son
in her whole life Now this It

EXTINT CHILIVIS BLDGBRYANT’S 4RUNNER - MORNING
This normally dead street is PACKED with PRESS today
Bryant drives Jewell into the drivewayalley of this
building his truck pushing the MOB aside as he smiles
warmly for the cameras

Instantly Nadya (in her car) and Dave Dutchess (in his)

pull their cars NOSE-TO-NOSE in front of the alley
blockading it behind Bryants

INT CHILIVIS BLDG - CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
An odd musty feel Medieval TAPESTRIES hang on the
wall The shades are down because the MOB is right

outside in the alley -- so the room is sunless

Jewell sits scared as he’s wired by RICHARD RACKLEFF
(50s stocky an FBI lifer private sector now)

JEWELL
Don’t see why we can’t just let
the FBI do this

BRYANT
You’d trust them with the results

Bryant opens the shades waves out the window

JEWELL
Who ya wavin’ to

BRYANT
My new friends

An FBI VAN WITH BUBBLE-WINDOWS sits across the street

JEWELL

INT BRYANT’S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER

Nadya rests on the couch Bryant looks out the WINDOW at
that BUBBLE-WINDOW VAN and the MOB loitering outside

BRYANT
Can you make some more of those
pirozhkis They were good

NADYA
Careful Watson In Russia if a
woman makes pirozhkis twice for a
man it means they’re engaged

He grins Rackleff enters looking grim

Bryant springs toward him motioning for him to be QUIET
pointing to the ceiling and indicating “BUGS”

Rackleff nods leans in and WHISPERS

RACKLEFF
Your boy is tanking Hard

Bryant’s eyes widen Nadya’s too Bryant WHISPERS
BACK

BRYANT
What does that mean

RACKLEFF
His pulse respiration and skin
conductivity are all off the
charts -- all pointing to massive
deception And guilt

RICHARD JEWELL - 62019 (Full Blue)

BRYANT
(oh fuck)
I Uh
RACKLEFF

Looks to be in the throes of an
anxiety attack Think you could
calm him down a little

INT CHILIVIS BLDG - CONFERENCE ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER
A DONUT sits on a plate
Jewell still wired-up eyes it Bryant beside him

JEWELL
That mean I’m doin’ bad

BRYANT
Youre doing fine He thinks your
blood sugar’s low Eat it

Jewell bites into the donut his eyes shutting

BRYANT
Can I tell you something Richard
(as Jewell shrugs)
I went to Episcopal school as a
kid When I was in first grade
two nuns accused me of writing
something unholy on my desk --

Jewell’s wondering Why is he telling me this

BRYANT
I hadn’t done it but they were
sure I had So they sent me back
to kindergarten for a week -- just
to humiliate me then they asked
me if I’d learned my lesson I
said I hadn’t because I hadn’t
written on the desk in the first
place They asked me how I’d like
to go sit in kindergarten for TWO
weeks I said ‘You can throw me
in there for a year -- I still
can’t apologize for writing on the
desk because I DIDN’T DO IT’

JEWELL
You said that to nuns

( )

I did And they backed off
(re FBI agents)
Power doesn’t make a person right
Just tell your story okay

Jewell nods ready

INT BRYANT’S OFFICE - 4 HOURS LATER - DAY 149
Bryant and Nadya sleep on the couch

Rackleff enters after a 4-HOUR test exhausted Nadya
bolts up Bryant waits afraid to breathe

BRYANT
(re ceiling bugs)
Maybe we should talk somewhere el--
RACKLEFF
He passed highest level ‘No
deception indicated’

Bryant wants to SHOUT or jump up and down WE CAN WIN
THIS THING But he remains calm

BRYANT

Jewell appears over Rackleff’s shoulder Equally

exhausted Bryant eyes him A shared moment

Hi Kathy

She looks up And her eyes go wide -- because
HERE ARE BRYANT AND JEWELL In the lions’ den

It comes to a halt SILENCE Kathy bracing herself --

( )

RICHARD JEWELL - 62019 (Full Blue) 101

BRYANT
It was a souvenir from the
bombing Not the bomb I said
that when you asked for a quote

KATHY
I know I’m sorry

BRYANT

And who are you to make fun of a
guy for staying with his mother
She was going to have SURGERY he
wanted to help her out What’s
weird about that Tell him

(off no reply)
While you’re at it you can tell
him how he ‘approached this
newspaper seeking publicity for
his actions’ Which he didn’t

KATHY
That was added during editorial

BRYANT
Or how he fits the lone-bomber
profile to a T a ‘wannabe’
seeking to become a hero when all
he did was actually SAVE LIVES
Go ahead We’ve got all day

KATHY
It was a mistake I’m human

BRYANT
Sos Richard

With that Bryant and Jewell head out Kathy’s silent

INT HOTEL - BALLROOM - DAY

of REPORTERS AND CAMERAS Bryant just a few feet away as

pray to God that this never

think any of you can even begin to
imagine what our lives are like

151

BOBI
They have taken all privacy from
us They have taken all peace
They watch and photograph
everything we do And why
Because my son did his job
because he saved people

Bobi looks to her side Bryant encouraging her

BOBI
I am asking the President for help
today Mister President my son
is a hero I think the FBI knows
that by now the evidence makes it
plain If they do not intend to
charge my son please tell us
Please tell the world

Bobi has one more sentence to get through And it is --

BOBI
Mister President please clear my
son’s name

And she loses it breaking down in sobs on camera
Bryant steps up gently guiding her off the podium

INT HOTEL - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 152
Bobi is a wreck Bryant leads her into a large KITCHEN --

Jewell has been waiting here among BUSBOYS and CHEFS
Bobi falls into his arms sobbing

JEWELL
Momma it’s awright

BOBI
I don’t know what happened I
thought I didn’t have any more
tears left Was that okay
Watson

Jewell and Bobi turn and their jaws drop a bit because

Bryant’s eyes are wet too It shocks him as much as it
shocks them BUSBOYS watch He gathers himself then

BRYANT
This all has to end now Richard
I mean really end You know that
(as Jewell nods)
I’m calling the FBI

Jewell watches him go memories swirling Bryant too

BRYANT
See if he’s got any Snickers bars

Jewell almost laughs Almost

BRYANT
You know what a 1001 is Richard

JEWELL
Lying to a federal agent

BRYANT
It’s a felony You say anything
in there that isn’t true they can
put you in jail without ever
proving you’re a bomber So if
you don’t know what to say you
say nothing You ask for a five-
minute break you consult with me

SHAW
Richard have you ever accessed an
Internet site called Candyman’s
Candyland for information about
The Anarchist’s Cookbook

JEWELL
No I have not

SHAW
But you did have police training
in handling explosives

BRYANT
We’ve covered this

SHAW
Did you ever collect any pieces of
pipe from Centennial Park when it
was under construction

JEWELL
No I did not

( )

RICHARD JEWELL - 62019 (Full Blue) 107

SHAW
Did you ever tell anyone in that
park ‘Take my picture now ‘cause
one day I’m going to be famous’

JEWELL
No sir
(as Bryant eyes him)
No I did not

SHAW
Sure about that

JEWELL
Hundred percent

SHAW
Did you ever tell anyone that you
were on your way to Atlanta and
‘It’s gonna be a mess out there’

JEWELL
I meant the traffic jams

SHAW
Was there a specific reason you
asked to be stationed at the sound
and light tower

JEWELL
I liked listening to the music
The night before I’d had my mom
come out to hear Kenny Rogers
Also it was a great place to look
at girls I am not a homosexual

SHAW
You and David Dutchess are not
lovers

BRYANT

Asked and answered

SHAW
Richard you said earlier that on
the night of the explosion as you
were moving from the tower to the
stage and back again you did not
have a fix on the time Is that
right

( )

RICHARD JEWELL - 62019 (Full Blue) 108

JEWELL
When you have the runs -- excuse
me -- you’re not thinking about

what time it is You’re just
trying to get to a bathroom

SHAW
So you can’t say exactly when you
saw those drunks throwing the beer
cans at the tower

JEWELL
No

SHAW
Or when you first saw the
backpack

JEWELL

That’s correct

SHAW
Had you ever seen a backpack like
that before

JEWELL
I suppose so

SHAW
Had you ever seen that particular
backpack before

BRYANT
Asked and answered Can we move
on

SHAW

Richard did you conspire with
David Dutchess or anyone else to
plant a bomb at Centennial Park

Jewell sags We PUSH IN ON him his eyes shut as --

SHAW
Then how the fuck did you know to
be behind that ATandT Tower at
exactly the right moment so it’d
protect you from the explosion

Jewell’s knocked back Shaw eyes him venomous

SHAW
Cops flying into the air I was
one of ‘em And you come out
without a scratch How is that
HOW IS THAT

If Jewell is going to buckle now is the moment But

JEWELL
Can I ask you fellas something
Do you have any kind of actual
CASE against me

That surprised EVERYONE -- Bryant the feds But --
- It’s time to speak truth to power at last

JEWELL
I mean evidence Was there
anything in my mother’s
Tupperware Any bomb-making
materials in her apartment

BRYANT
Richard you don’t need to
volunteer anything here Let’s
let them ask the --

JEWELL
-- I used to think federal law
enforcement was just about the
highest calling a person could
aspire to But I hafta say I
don’t anymore Not after all
this

Bryant just decided to let Jewell go

( )

RICHARD JEWELL - 62019 (Full Blue) 110

JEWELL

I did my job that night Some
people are alive right now ‘cause
of that But the next time some
security guard sees a suspicious
package somewhere ya think he’s
gonna call it in I doubt it
He’s gonna say to himself ‘I
don’t wanna be another Richard
Jewell So I’m just gonna run’
And how’s that make anybody any
safer

(as no one replies)
You-all can keep followin’ me I
guess I can stand it But every
second you spend on me is time you
aren’t on the guy who actually DID
it And like Watson said what
happens when he does it again

(as again no answer)
So are you gonna charge me with
anything Can you

The truth No They can’t They don’t have anything

Jewell shrugs “Open it” Bryant opens it
Inside a 100-dollar bill Bryant grins

JEWELL
All square

Bryant nods his fondness obvious But just then --

The elevator stops on 8 and a GUY gets in Call him JOE
NOBODY The doors close

Down we go in silence But --

Joe Nobody grimaces He KNOWS he recognizes Jewell from
somewhere Just can’t figure out where It’s bugging him

Jewell and Bryant have experienced this 500 times now
It’s always annoying But they let it go

We can feel Joe Nobody racking his memory Where have I
seen this guy’s face before But he’s drawing blanks

Elevator stops on the 2nd floor Joe gets out Finally

Then just as the doors start to close his eyes light up
It just came to him He turns to Jewell so excited

JOE NOBODY
Now I remember You’re the
Olympic bomber
That lands on the faces of Jewell and Bryant -- a sense
that this will never end not really anyway Jewell
knows that in his soul

As the doors close we hear

No he’s the hero

As he will forever come to his defense
