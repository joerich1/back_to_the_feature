(Shoot draft - July 2015)
EXT ROAD - EVENING

The WIPERS on a windscreen move back and forth Our view is
blurred by the RAIN A Phone RINGS We SEE a strong headlight
approaching from the left

And then A TRUCK comes CRASHING into the car from the side
making it violently propel out of frame Before we know who’s
in it FADE OUT

EXT KAPOOR’S FAMILY HOUSE - MORNING

An old not the most well maintained yet a charming single
storey bungalow with a lawn in front

Legend 10 days earlier Coonoor

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

A fly buzzes past a bowl of cereal We follow a spoon up to
an OLD MAN’s mouth We can hear the cereal CRUNCH

GRAND DAD (VO)
I’m old Bald My toenails have
turned strange But life isn’t all
that bad

This is GRAND DAD He sits at the dining table and looks at a
few FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS hung on the wall in front of him

GRAND DAD (VO)
I often wonder when I die would it
bring about any change in anyone’s
life Or am I just another ordinary
soul passing through time

He throws a piece of bread to his dog - GEISHU the dog
catches it mid air and gulps it down

The fly now buzzes close to the dog’s face He looks at it
anxiously

GRAND DAD (VO)

If I live another 7 days I will be
90

(beat)
Most would feel that that’s an
awfully long life to live and
maybe it is but who cares I just
want to enjoy it before I go up in
fiery red flames and dirty black
smoke ‘Cause in the end

(beat)
in this uncertain life only one
thing is certain--

The dog catches the fly and Grandad’s head drops down onto
the breakfast table with a THUMP

The dog spits out the fly DEAD

Grandfather’s son HARISH (late 50’s) and daughter-in-law
SUNITA (mid 50’s) who have been sitting right opposite him
stop their morning chores Their reaction is under-whelming

SUNITA
(calls out casually)
Dharmendar khana utha lo

DHARMENDAR their servant comes and clears Grand dad’s plate

SUNITA (CONTD)
Aur suno aloo ubal gaye honge toh
yahaan le aana Bathroom saaf kiya
(Dharmendar shakes head)
Phenyl daala

Harish gets back to sorting his account papers and Sunita
back to slicing vegetables Grand dad opens his eyes

GRAND DAD (VO)
Kai dinon se marne ki practice kar
raha hoon Rehearsal achchi hogi
toh professionally marunga Waise
bhi maut life mein ek hi baar aati
hai

Grand dad gets up and elegantly cleans his face Then with
the help of his walker heads to his room

SUNITA
Paper chhod kar inpe thoda dhyan
doge Ek hafte se bus marne ki
rehearsal kar rahe hain

HARISH
(busy scrambling through
bills)
--Ab is umar mein kya samjhaun Aur
ye bhindi account papers pe Hatao
yaar saara masala lag raha hai

SUNITA
(mumbles )
Bus Account papers hi hain paise
kab aaenge bhagavan jaane

HARISH
Jab tum taane marna band karogi na
toh apne aap aa jayeinge
(looks at a bill)
Aur ye kya hai 6700 rupay bijli
ka bill
(MORE )
HARISH (CONTD)
Din mein hazaar baar bolta hun tv
ko main switch se band karo

SUNITA

Haan ghar se light pankhe niklva
dete hain bijli ka bill aayega hi
nahin

(segue)
Plumber ko bulaya

(he doesn’t react)
Teen din se bathroom leek kara raha
hai Magar jab tak ghar swimming
pool nahin ban jata tumhein kya
farak padta hai

A LOUD THUD

SUNITA (CONTD)
Phir se Dharmendar Jaake dekho

The dog senses something wrong he walks to the corridor and
sniffs Grand dad’s body lying on the floor Is he dead this
time

SUNITA (0S) (CONT’D)
Parson chaati par tumator ka sauce
laga ke lawn mein so gaye thhe

IE BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Arjun weaves his way through a semi-crowded house party He
doesn’t recognize any of these faces from before but he
continues to walk regardless

We see a guy and a girl sitting opposite one another about
to ARM-WRESTLE each other The guy SAHIL is skinny and tiny
the girl BUNKOO well-built

Next to them is a girl standing on a chair cheering them on
Arjun can’t seem to get a look at her

TIA
Come one guys koi toh Saahil pe
bharosa karo

The crowd is going bananas cheering for Bunkoo and money is
streaming in for her

SAHIL
Tujhe demolish karne mein bahut
mazaa aayega

BUNKOO

Curious Arjun walks around to get a better look but just
when he’s about to see her face the LIGHTS GO OFF NO MUSIC

A bit of COMMOTION in the dark and then a few people switch
on their PHONE LIGHTS He finally sees her face dimly lit in
the phone light this is TIA mid 20’s extremely cute but
totally not aware of it

and hands it to her The LIGHTS come back on So does the
MUSIC and the cheering continues as the crowd goes
“Three Two One” Bunkoo simply slams Sahil’s hand in
one swift motion

Arjun leaves

IE BATHROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

happens Par do bhaiyon ko same
time pe same idea it’s too much of
a coincidence

Tumne ussey kabhi poocha nahin

ARJUN
Poochta toh sab yaheen kehte ki
humesha ki tarah main usske success
se jal raha thha Plus mom ko laga
aisa issue humaari family ko todh

Agar uss novel ke cover par mera
naam hota toh publishers aaj mere
peeche daud rahe hote aur mere mom
dad mujhe itna bada loser nahin
samajhte

left hand drive

---song lyrics---

And suddenly Arjun does a fake swerve as if he’s going to
crash into the other car

SCREECH The other driver loses control and goes almost off
the road

He gives her a side hug she’s glad he’s back We let them
share this personal moment and dissolve into

EXT TIA BUNGALOW - NIGHT

They sit opposite each other Nobody says anything for a bit
and then after a moment it starts to Rain outside

ARJUN
Mujhe laga tum aaogi nahin

Mujhe laga tum phone nahin karoge

A beat

ARJUN

INT MOTHERS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Mother enters her room to find a copy of Arjun’s first
published novel’s draft on her table A small post it note
that dedicated the novel to her

DISSOLVE TO

EXT LAWN - MORNING

It’s a sunny day We slowly tilt down to the door Rahul
opens the door and the family steps out one by one We see
what they see

Chairs have been lined up for the photoshoot once again and
Wasim’s assistant is setting up the frame

The family looks at all this preparation with a strange sense
of Deja vu hurt and anxiety It brings back memories from
probably the worst day of their lives

- But ironically this moment also brings with it a chance
to fix things

Slowly everyone comes and takes their respective positions
Rahul and Arjun come stand next to the mother Who’s finding
it hard to control her emotions and nervousness

Grand dad sits in the centre and Chacha’s family around him

Then Grand dad signals someone off screen to bring
something Music slowly begins to pick up

Tia and Wasim walk in with a tall cut-out wrapped in
newspaper They all look at it with anticipation Maybe they
even know what’s in it

They unwrap it - and we reveal a life-size standee of the
father Mum’s eyes are welling up

And just like that the family realizes this is it This
is the moment to forgive to let go of the past to
reconnect

Arjun holds Mum’s hand tight and Rahul kisses her on the
head She looks at them with all the love she’s been curbing
deep inside She’s sobbing all the pressure resentment and
anger she’s felt seeps out of her She hugs them both tightly
and they both hug her back

Trapped in a loving embrace feelings rise up unbidden and
overpowering everyone

Finally a calm sets in the hug breaks apart A smile and
then everyone looks into camera

GRAND DAD (VO)
I finally got the photograph I
always wanted It wasn’t perfect
but then neither were we

We see the whole family together and the father’s standee in
between

THE END
