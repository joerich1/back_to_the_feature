EXT SPACE NIGHT

Huge molten rocks tumble towards us out of the dark We
don’t know where we are just that it’s terrifying Were one
to hit us we would be obliterated in an instant

EXT SPACE NIGHT

Further back it is now clear that we are in the middle of an
asteroid shower powering through space Behind the turmoil of
flying rocks in suspended tranquility we see the striped
exotic colours of distant planets

EXT SKY NIGHT

Black Faint pin-pricks that we recognise as stars
Distantly we see the asteroid shower trailing its fire
across our dark galaxy

EXT EARTH NIGHT

A mile above the earth We are moving towards a beacon of
light in the darkness Closer it is revealed to be a
stadium lit up for an event It could be baseball soccer a
U2 concertwhatever it is we hear the growing roar like
the sea crashing against the shore

Closer still we see the seething crowd Which mixes into

EXT CROWD SCENES VARIOUS

more crowds Thousands and thousands of people all having
a huge huge night A Mexican wave erupts A soccer crowd
roars its approval at a goal An army of fans stretch their
yearning hands towards the singer on stage a million Indians
at the Kumbh Mela a rave in a field a subway party a flash
mob in Victoria Station faithful singing at a midnight mass
in St Peter’s Basilica

This is humanity united

INT ARON’S HOUSE BEDROOM HALL LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Sudden and jolting silence A bedroom Not much in it Then
a phone rings Shocking in this silent world The camera
stops then moves through the house the camera our POV

We see a meticulously tidy sparse environment Very male
The camera stops in the doorway of the living room where the
phone is ringing Eventually the answer-phone clicks in

PHONE
Hi this is Aron Leave a message
Business-like We can’t get any kind of a fix on Aron’s
personality from this

INT ARON’S HOUSE NIGHT

PHONE
Hi Aron only Mom Dad’s out of
town on a conference so I thought
it’d be nice to have a chat
Anyway guess you’re out having a
good time Hope so Try and give me
a call sometime soon If you can I
know how busy you are Love you
Bye

The phone rings off leaving nothing but a flashing red light
in the dark room The camera moves back down the hall into
the bedroom again We are its eyes

INT ARON’S HOUSE NIGHT

Then a hand reaches high and opens a cupboard door Picks up
a mini cam-corder off a high shelf Drops it in a back-pack
Reaches in again gets a climbing harness The jingle of
carabiners The hand clips a descender onto a loop on the
harness A Camelbak pouch of water another water bottle All
drop in the rucsack

The hand gropes blindly around the high shelf Looking for
something else something out of sight We see a Swiss Army
Knife at the back of the shelf His hand skims past it a
couple of times millimeters away Misses it

Clearly giving up on this the hand picks up a coil of
climbing rope moves into another room We move with the
hand not seeing the person just his efficient intent

INT ARON’S HOUSE KITCHEN NIGHT

Tidy clean surfaces The hand reaches up grabs a neatly-
made burrito wrapped in a transparent sandwich bag goes into
a cupboard and takes three energy bars a bottle of Gatorade
The hand shuts the cupboard skims the spotless surface
picks up a grapefruit on the way past and moves towards the
door We hear a door shut A key turn The sound of a truck
door opening and shutting An engine starts with a roar

EXT CITY NIGHT

We focus on a 98 red and white Toyota Tacoma with a topper
driving down a busy street
INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

From the inside of the truck we look out on large groups of
people crossing the road at random crowding the sidewalks
all congregating on a big stadium by the side of the road
There’s clearly a massive football game on tonight

We can see shouting cheering laughing from the crowds
outside the truck but can hear nothing Even when a couple
of drunken fans lurch around the car banging on the trunk
we barely hear a thing We are in a silent bubble moving past
and away

EXT FREEWAY NIGHT

An overhead shot of a crammed freeway The Toyota is one of
Many cars heading out It turns off the freeway

INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

A hand slips a CD into the truck’s player Music booms out
For the first time we see the owner of the truck Aron
Ralston 27 We study his face for clues Fit tanned by the
wind not the beach Not giving much away

The screen splits into two and then three though at times
there appears to be no division at all

TRIPTYCH TITLES

The opening titles are a series of triptychs three strips of
pictures that merge blend overlap and are intercut with
adverts from the tv and radio and some that flash past
outside Aron’s Toyota

A title card reads

“Utah The Canyonlands The slickrock desert The red dust
and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky- all that which lies
beyond the end of the roads”

Edward Abbey Desert Solitaire

EXT ROAD NIGHT

Aron’s truck is now alone on an interstate road

At the south-west edge of Green River Aron drives under the
interstate into a landscape of obscurity He looks to his
right and left Not a single light perforates the absolute
blackness of the San Rafael Desert

Three quarters of the screen is black All we see are truck

EXT ROAD NIGHT

A BLM sign indicates that Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead is 47
miles ahead through the desert darkness

EXT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

The truck skids to a halt Turns a sharp left down the trail
and bumps into the darkness

INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

Aron’s whole upper body is pumping along to the music
Another bright yellow sign flashes past “Roads may be
impassable due to storms” But Aron is too focussed on the
music to notice

EXT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

The truck’s headlights scrape a massive slice of rock The

lights illuminate a series of petroglyphs and pictographs
carved and painted into the rock by ancient civilisations
The images materialise on different parts of the triptych
superhumans hovering 8 feet high over groups of indistinct
animals their long dark bodies and huge eyes more extra-

terrestrial than human

EXT DESERT NIGHT

Tyres rushing across the desert grooves pulling snatching
hard left and right The rear of the truck fish-tails madly
INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

Everything in the truck is bouncing up and down crazily All
except the bike locked down in the back of the truck braced
solid Suddenly a small brown sign flashes past

ARON
Woah

He kicks down on the brakes

EXT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

The truck skids to a halt

INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

ARON
Nearly missed it

Aron leans over to the rucsac on the passenger seat Gets out
a small video camera and films the sign

the truck starts up again

Still driving now with one hand Aron flicks on the interior
light Turns down the music Turns the camera round on
himself

He throws the video camera into the top of the back-pack
turns up the music to ear bleed level

INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

Aron turns off the music Ejects the CD Bangs open the glove-
box and flings the CD inside Shuts the glove box

The camera watches the plastic glove box for a longer moment
than seems necessary Then Aron’s hand comes back in
reaches inside roots around and gets out a multi-tool hidden
at the back Slams the glove box again

Aron gets out of the truck expecting a head to pop out of a
tent But silence Stillness Ghostly He goes round to the

EXT DESERT DAY
VIDEO POV

The video camera is mounted on the handlebars pointing up at
Arons face as he rides across the desert jolting skidding
huge amounts of video drop-out and electronic chaos But
despite all that theres Arons face loving every moment of
it

ARON
Bluejohn Canyon Guidebook time to
the drop-in two and a half hours
Aiming to take 45 minutes off that
Yee-hahhhh

And with an adrenaline yell he tips down a suicidal slope at
speed He wears a bandana across his mouth to keep out the
dust an old Phish t-shirt and lycra bike shorts He is an
advert for extreme sports the smile on his face and the
complete control over his bike telling us all we need to
know

EXT DESERT DAY

Even uphill Aron is hammering his way up the sandstone
Gasping for oxygen his legs screaming for rest he pushes
and pushes until he crests the ridge His mouth sucks on the
tube from his camelbak rehydration system- a bladder of water
in his back-pack

BIG CLOSE UP

Huge in camera we see the air bubbles and the water be
sucked towards his parched mouth

ARON
(utter delight )
Ahhh

God that’s good But no rest He is off again down down
the steep slope controlled skids dodging the boulders an
extreme sports junkie at the top of his game- until

EXT DESERT DAY

Suddenly his front wheel hits a sand trap He is hurled
forwards over the handle bars face first into the sand His
toe-clips and his momentum bring the whole bike with him The
bike has him trapped on the desert floor like a wrestling
take-down He sits up disentangles himself from the bike
detaches the camera and carefully wipes the sand from it
Turns it towards him

VIDEO POV
ARON
Uncool You didnt see that Nobody
saw that
Aron rewinds the images

ARON (CONT’D)

The camera pulls back and up higher and higher until Aron is
a tiny speck marooned in a hundred miles of red sand

EXT DESERT DAY

From a dot in the landscape to the huge ticking watch again
Aron checks the time He is up back on the bike and away
not in the least deterred by his crash He is unstoppable
EXT DESERT DAY

At what seems like the only tree for miles he U-locks his
bike in the shade pockets the keys and jogs off into the
desert scoffing a muffin as he goes

EXT APPROACH TO BLUE JOHN CANYON DAY

Aron is bum-sliding down a steep slab Lands neatly on his
feet at the bottom Then stops dead As if the film has
frozen Voices Girls’ voices A giggle Definitely a giggle

Megan Kristi the lead girl in confidence and looks Megan

ARON
Hey
They squint up at him haloed by the sun They both look
surprised You really don’t meet other people out here They
can barely see him whited out by sun just an outline of
human He scrambles down towards them Lands as neatly as an
acrobat right next to them As far as they are concerned
he’s just landed from outer space They take a step back

MEGAN
Woah

He struggles with the bandana around his mouth
ARON (CONTD)
I’m really only a psychopath on

He takes the bandana off with a flourish Shrugs as if that’s
the best he can do with the materials available

They all laugh and head up the narrow canyon

EXT LONG WALL DAY

The three of them are standing in front of the petroglyphs
and pictographs that are carved and painted onto the flat
cliff side Outside the shade of the cliff the day is
fierce white mottled heat In contrast to the previous
breezy scenes this all hazy Picnic at Hanging Rock
trippiness

They stand in the shade of the golden wall moving silently
from one shape to another The images merge dreamily The
strange warrior-like aliens the wild sheep the circles and
spirals that nobody understands

You can hear their quiet breathing echoing off the cool
rock

Aron watches Kristi wipe a tear from her eye Silently he
offers her his water bottle She smiles shakes her head and
moves away

EXT LONG WALL CANYON DAY
Back in the fierce sun they can breathe and speak freely

again The three of them make their way down from the images
Silence for a long time
She shakes her head moves off down towards the path
and Megan follow They reach the bottom of the canyon
Another fork in the road There is an awkward pause

He pauses

ARON
You okay

KRISTI
Yeah

ARON

Something special huh

KRISTI
Yeah it was just- that was one of
the most amazing things I’ve ever
seen

ARON
Three thousand years they’ve been

place I know near here Twenty
minutes that way It’s like the
most fun you can have with your
clothes on Actually it’s best
without your clothes on but that’s

The girls look at each other

ARON (CONTD)
It’s a bit of a climb

KRISTI AND MEGAN
We climb

They all laugh

Aron

EXT CANYON DAY

They are negotiating a narrow gully Aron is half-way down
Megan at the top and Kristi on her way down to him

ARON
--I’m not qualified yet but
that’s what I want to do

MEGAN
So when you said you were a
guide This is illegal
instructing

ARON
You’re Union busting Ma’am right
this minute

MEGAN
If I’d a knownwell maybe I
wouldn’t have my ass stuck in a
crack

ARON
There’s a hold for your right foot
down down down that’s it It’s
hard to get the hours Catch 22

Kristi is sort of stuck No panic she’s just- well stuck

KRISTI
Well sign your time-cardas
long as you tell me what to do now
I’m kinda stuck

ARON
Okay push your butt hard on the
wall and udge your way over back
and footing it Then reach your
right hand out there for those
bomber jugs high on the left wall
and bring your left foot onto that
incut there

INT CAVE SMOOTH DOME DAY

Towards us comes Aron upside down like a tiny fast spider
talking all the time His voice echoes He is stripped to the
waist and topless looks even fitter than we suspected We
can’t even see the girls

KRISTI 0OS
Shall we just follow you Aron

ARON
It’s easier than it looks trust
me There are hundreds of holds
but you can’t see them until you’re
right on them And they keep on
comingIt’s an act of faith Keep
climbing and lo Holds will
appeartake off as much as you
dareyou’1l see why in a minute

MEGAN 0OS
You behave Aron Ralston or we’ll
tell your Mother where you lure
young girls

ARON
Swear I won’t look Swear you won’t
care when you get there

There’s a lot of air below him a feeling of the vertiginous
as much from the echo and the reflected light from the dome

ARON (CONTD)

Oh about the holds I forgot to
say when you get to the middle

He lets go

ARON (CONTD)
there aren’t any

And we see him drop 60 feet into the most exquisite emerald
blue pool Megan screams has a heart attack

KRISTI
Oh my God

INT CAVE DAY

They can’t see him only hear the explosive crack of man on
water He could be dead

MEGAN
Jesus Are you okay Aron Aron

KRISTI
Listen to the guy He’s okay

Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish
song at the top of his voice Kristi strips to her underwear
and traverses away from Megan

KRISTI (CONTD)
Gotta be there Meg

INT CAVE DAY

We are in the pool with Aron Slick wet hair buzzing with
adrenaline He is looking up at Kristi traversing out along
the line of holds

ARON
Woo That’s it Keep coming

Then Megan appears She’s left everything on except her
shoes

ARON (CONTD)
Better hope you don’t sink with all
those clothes on Megan

MEGAN
Better hope I don’t land on your
head Aron

They crash into the pool one after the other They bob
together in the centre their breath coming in short excited
bursts The light seemingly coming from beneath them and
rippling over the cavernous ceiling They are laughing- at
their own daring at the craziness of where they are at
being alive

KRISTI
Oh my God oh my God

MEGAN
Again We’ve got to go again

ARON
And this time film it

EXT OUTSIDE THE CAVE DAY

They are drying off in the sun and picking at the remains of
their lunch Kristi is stretched out near Aron taking in the
sun on her near naked body She is flicking through the
stills on his camera Megan has taken off most of her clothes
to dry too Still a touch self-conscious she sits a little
bit away from them

CAMERA STILLS

far-reaching views others are beset with snow flurries and

But Kristi really wants to know

KRISTI
Seriously Nobody to share the view
with- though if you’re doing it in
winter hello what view The
experience Nobody to share that
with Don’t get it Aron

ARON
It’s the challenge You get
yourself in trouble you get
yourself out You live or die on
your own decisions Ultimate self-
reliance

KRISTI
I guess Seems kinda lonely
ARON
(shrugs)

It’s the way I like it

Still a little mystified Kristi gives the camera back to
Aron Lies back on the slab and closes her eyes to the sun

KRISTI
Hmm FabulousYou must be way
behind schedule by now

He looks at her Without turning her closed eyes from the
sun she smiles

KRISTI (CONTD)
Those Kangaroo rats youre keeping
waiting

ARON
Actually I stopped the clock

This gets a response She turns

KRISTI
You “stopped the clock”

ARON
I’m timing myself Seeing if I can
cut 45 minutes off the guide book
time When you guys are
goneclick Clock’s running
again

Kristi doesn’t know quite what to make of this But there’s
just the hint of unease

KRISTI
Huh

She turns back to the sun

MEGAN
No girlfriend then Aron

ARON
Nobody special

MEGAN
There’s always somebody special
There’s always the “one”

ARON
Not for me

KRISTI
They all say that

MEGAN
Sounds real certain about that

He shrugs

ARON
Don’t believe in all that ‘one’
baloney that’s all

KRISTI
I bet you don’t

Said with more weight than she intended She’s not sure why
but she’s going off him Gets to her feet

The noise of five hundred people cheering blasts his- and our-

Close up of Aron’s face eyes already focussed on placing his

Megan shouts after him

MEGAN

But he is in a different world

MEGAN (CONT’D)

him right

She looks at Kristi looking at Aron Nudges her knowingly

Kristi continues to stare at his disappearing figure

KRISTI
Know what I don’t think we figured
in his day at all

EXT BLUE JOHN CANYON

Aron’s eyes We see what really figures in his day His hands
grip small holds His feet smear on smooth rock He is moving
traversing across steep rock towards a water-worn S-shaped
log trapped across a narrow fissure His mouth sings along to
the music He reaches the S-shaped log crouches down gives
it two firm hits with his palm Solid He drops all the
weight onto his arms allows his body to dead-hang from the
log for a couple of beats and then drops the four feet to the
sandy ground below His feet neatly hit the sand with a puff
of dust Nothing to it

EXT CU DAY

A small snake slithers away from his giant feet

EXT S-SHAPED LOG DAY

Title 241 PM Saturday April 26th 2003

ARON
Won’t be coming back this way

INT SLOT CANYON DAY (FROM HERE ON CANYON SHOTS INT)

He spins and continues along the narrow alley of the slot
canyon seeing the first huge chockstones half-buried in the
sand big as trucks He easily scrambles over one and around
another

Thump thump He gives it two firm hits with his palm again
an automatic instinct that accompanies every new boulder The
boulder doesn’t move

It’s a tight fit but he’s like a contortionist and just
squeezes through

INT DEEPER INTO THE CANYON DAY

The slot is now just 4 ft wide and as he stops to look at
massive logs jammed way above his head silhouetted against
the cloudless blue he drinks deeply from his water bottle

INT CANYON RIM LOOKING DOWN DAY

On we go and so does the concert in Aron’s head He pumps
the air to the music One set of chockstones leads to
another He rapidly negotiates them like an obstacle race
giving each one the requisite test with his palm to check for
movement Then he is stopped by one the size of a big
refrigerator jammed between the walls of the canyon
eighteen inches above the floor

INT CANYON CHOCKSTONES DAY

Over or under He drops to his belly and squeezes underneath
rucking the sandy floor in front of him He’s halfway his
chest rising out the far side when suddenly he jams The
music locks up too looping continuously on two notes like
bad techno He pushes but nothing

Utter stillness Only a flicker of panic in Aron’s blinking
eyes reassures us that the world has not frozen

We see from his point of view There’s a hell of a lot of
stone above him

Then Aron slowly reaches back with his hand With the careful
precision of a lock-picker he releases a part of his back-
pack strap that has snagged The music unjams too He jumps
up brushes off the sand

INT SLOT CANYON DAY

Tight on Aron’s throat as he swallows water down from his
bottle Big gulps

We follow his gaze down the slot It’s steeper now We’re
already 60 feet below ground level it’s falling further in
front of us This is more like caving He gets the map out

INTEXT SILHOUETTE PROFILE CROSS SECTION OF THE CANYON
DAY

We see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of Aron
moving within it We track in and elide into a graphic view
of him chimneying his way along the canyon- now only three
feet wide at most We see his skill using his legs back
friction to body-walk along the smooth sheer walls He’s
going deep

INT SLOT CANYON DAY

He moves towards another chockstone below him You can see
his thinking this one’s about the size of a bus wheel He
can crouch on top dead-hang from it and reduce the drop to
the canyon floor

INT SLOT CANYON DAY

He reaches it at the same time we do jumping down on top of
it Crouches Gives it the two thumps with his palm Solid
Reaches his hand around the back of the boulder for a hold
Dangles

INT CANYON CU TIGHT ON ARON

Just as he dangles there’s a scraping sound Small but
close The stone judders towards him pulled by the torque of
his hand weighting it from the back It rotates

ARON
Shit

Instantly and instinctively he lets go and drops- as if he’s
trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor

INT CANYON ON CHOCKSTONE DAY

But it’s following him down

INT CANYON ARON’S POV DAY

The backlit chockstone falls towards him Two tons of
boulder consuming the sky

INT SLOT CANYON DAY

He lifts his arms to protect his head but his eyes remain
open Through his fingers we see the next three seconds

The rock grabs his left hand and flings it against the left
wall He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the
canyon wall and careers towards his right arm which he
instinctively raises to protect his head

The rock smashes his right wrist and hand against the wall
and drags it down tearing the skin from him like a cheese-
grater

Aron is utterly powerless to stop its force able only to
land on his feet as the rock crunches to a halt trapped in
the slot With his hand Everything stops

INT CANYON FLOOR DAY

No movement Aron’s standing behind the rock As if he’s ina
line for a bus as if he’s shaking someone’s hand A
handshake with a canyon

Silence except for waves of applause and cheering coming
from the head-phones that have been ripped off Aron’s head
The cheering and clapping comes to a painfully slow end Now
shocked utter silence

Adrenaline searing roaring pain and panic

ARON
Get your hand outta there

Pulls and pulls Yanks twists screws until his shoulder is
almost dislocated But nothing moves

Sweat on his face

ARON (CONTD)
Shit shit shit SHIT

He pushes the boulder with his left hand to reverse the
movement Heaves at it with every sinew in his body Nothing
Heaves again And again and again thrusting with his knees
thighs shoulder everything Nothing He rests for a while
taking huge breaths

ARON (CONTD)
This is- this isridiculous

Even gives a brief puff of laughter Gathers himself Slams
upwards with his entire body a man running full pelt into a
door

ARON (CONTD)
Unnnagh

Air explodes out of his lungs There is the tiny hollow
sound of the boulder shifting fractionally

A howl of phenomenal pain

ARON (CONT’D)
No no no no no no Damn

He reverses the fraction and goes limp whimpering in sweat
His knees are bleeding from smashing them into the rock He
looks at his good fingers now lacerated He would collapse
to the floor But he can’t He’s stuck

He grabs a bit of shirt wipes the sweat away from his eyes
Loosens the strap on his back-pack pulls it over his head
and hula-hoops it around his body until it falls at his feet
With his free hand he gets out the water bottle Drinks
deep One gulp two gulps three- stops mid fourth and
backwashes it into the bottle

ARON (CONT’D)
No No more water

One-handed he rescrews the lid with difficulty Drops it
back in his pack

ARON (CONTD)
Stop Relax Come on think

He breathes and breathes taking stock for the first time

Aron examines the boulder at each point he can reach-
stretching and contorting his body to see into his crushed
hand to where his thumb is visible above and his little
finger below Compares left hand with right The right wrist
is now squeezed to the size of the width of his little
finger We know because he can barely get the little finger
of his left hand in the gap He’s still processing this whole
event how unlikely how bizarre

ARON
Jesus Jesus How How did you do
this You idiot you total idiot
It’s crushed man It’s fucking
dying

He reaches up and touches the trail of blood hair and skin
on the canyon wall Looks at it on his fingertips Silence
Except for the tick tick of his watch

One-handed he undoes his watch

We see the time in big close-up 314 Click The second hand

Aron is trying to balance the tip of the knife on top of his
forearm- with his mouth His left hand holds a flat rock A
bizarre close up as he almost taps the side of his eye
socket

ARON
And

Suddenly he hammers down with ten times more force onto the
handle of the knife The rock explodes in his hand showering
us with fragments

The knife bounces off the arm hits his shorts As he moves
to grab it he misses it and knocks it further round the back
of his leg

He pivots to try to catch it again but gravity is quicker
and the tool falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near
his left foot

ARON (CONT’D)
No no no

INT CANYON FLOOR DAY

The knife is visible in the crack below and behind his right
leg Because he can’t twist he can’t get anywhere near it
Heaves against the canyon wall to get there Pointless

He pulls off his right shoe and tries to squeeze his foot
into the hole Too big He looks upward Can’t believe it

We’re on a level with the knife in the hole beneath Aron’s
feet An enormous light blasts on overhead Aron’s head-

knife in a semi-circle It’s all a bit arcade game if it
wasn’t so fucking serious No success The stick is
withdrawn The knife remains

Pause An ant runs over the knife

The stick returns This time its top is almost broken off to
form a natural hook We push in on the knife as the stick
hooks through the little ring on the end of the knife
Slowly slowly it lifts

INT ARON IN CANYON DAY

Looking down onto the ground around his leg his toes
holding the stick like a chopstick Tremulously his leg
lifts the knife out and up towards his good arm Slowly
breathlessly He picks it off the end of the stick For the

We pass through the transparent title on our ghostly ride
along the canyon We’re with the wind blowing dust through
the canyon slot and come across a miner in the distance
digging at the rock Aron is using the shorter file from the
multi-tool now and has tied a shoe-lace to from his wrist
through the ring of the tool

He pulls his cap down to keep most of the dust from blowing

on his arm to keep it clear

from his crouch Flexes Man his legs are aching

Aron is in his harness He is throwing 30 feet of rope up
towards us A tangle of knots and carabiners at the end of it
looking for purchase close to camera Each time it falls
back He persists Dozens of jump cuts dozens of attempts

Finally it catches

He pulls on the rope gently at first then fiercely It’s
caught He clips the rope into his harness and sinks gently
down allowing the weight off his feet

Examines the knuckles of his left hand skinnned by the

He leans in earnestly trying to convey this idea

ARON (CONTD)
My DNA brought me right here From
the minute I was born Every breath
Ive taken every act has been
leading to this To this little
crack in the earths surface To
this boulder Cosmic Incredible
Beautiful

He stops as if listening to the other half of this
conversation

ARON (CONT’D)
No you dont get it I know you
dont get it But it makes sense to
me Total sense

Gives up trying to convince the invisible audience

ARON (CONT’D)
You had to be there

Laughs

ARON (CONTD)
Really You had to be there

A long violent burst of shivering afflicts him He comes out
of it finally

ARON (CONTD)
This canyons like an ice-box And
the wind Jesus the wind

Electronic static for a second as he switches off Then he is
back the wind bringing him back to some sort of reality

ARON (CONT’D)
Ive got some American Express
insurance that should cover the
costs of the recovery operation
Bank accounts are all in credit
Youll have to sell the
houseAll my life Ive been
asking for this and I got it

The screen fills with static

INT CANYON SUNSET

Aron is dangling asleep in his harness He is so still he
might be dead

And ant wanders across his free arm The arm twitches
Twitches again then shakes the ant off it No more movement

INT BEDROOM TWILIGHT

Rana naked She is making love to the camera staring right
into it

RANA
I love you

INT BEDROOM LATER

Rana is sitting on the side of the bed her naked back is
turned away from the camera which is our point of view- and
Aron’s

ARON VO
Rana

Her head whips round

RANA
Nothing Silence Fucking silence

An arm comes out in front of camera to touch her She shrugs
it off instantly

INT CANYON SUNSET
Close on Aron’s face his lips

ARON
(barely whispered)
I- I- I’m sorry

RANA
I say I love you and what do you
say “I’m sorry” You won’t let
anyone in will you Nobody Mister

She gets up roughly gathers her clothes together utterly
unconcerned with her nakedness

ARON VO
Rana

RANA
Youre frozen
She turns on the camera on us Right into the lens

RANA (CONT’D)
You’re stone

She walks to the door an action that allows her tears to
come

RANA (CONT’D)
You’re gonna be so lonely Aron

Walks out

INT CANYON SUNSET
A tear falls down his cheek lying against the rock
ARON
Stone
Suddenly CRACK A sound that makes Aron- and us- startle out
of our seats
He looks around panicked

Another crack He looks down Dark spots on his shorts

EXT SLOT CANYON DAY ARON’S POV SUNSET

Looks up There’s an angry-looking black motherfucker of a
cloud above him

INT CANYON SUNSET

CU on Aron’s eyes We look up at the sky A blob of rain
spatters the lens And then another

EXT CANYON SUNSET

Suddenly a crack of thunder like the earth has just split

A flash of Aron driving past the roadside sign that reads
“danger flash floods

Aron reacts as if it’s come to get him Panic

ARON
No No

He wrenches at the boulder pulls pushes Moans heaves
Nothing of course

EXT DESERT SUNSET

Massive thunderhead clouds rolling in impossibly fast The
desert dust is hit by silent bullets Raindrops gathering and
multiplying soaking the sand dark and then flowing into a
groove and slit being joined by other rivulets until water
is running finding its way along the jagged cracks in the
ground

Above us the sky is furious black Lightning arcs across the
sky

INT CANYON SUNSET

Aron’s sky darkens above him He looks truly scared has
somehow found some energy Gathers his possessions together

Sticks out his tongue to catch the drops

ARON
Please God not this Not this

EXT DESERT SUNSET

Water is pouring into a bigger channel We are with the
water being joined by other rivulets until in turn we join
a bigger water-course

EXT DESERT SUNSET

Another channel explodes as a volume of water engulfs it The
camera literally slips and slides as the water picks up
speed looking for release for a gulley for a- canyon

INT CANYON SUNSET

The bottom of the canyon has become a river It is surging
down the natural pipe-work of the desert

EXT BLUE JOHN CANYON S-SHAPED LOG SUNSET

From below we are looking at the S-shaped log as
unimaginable tons of water come pouring suddenly over the lip

of the canyon The canyon becomes a six foot wall of churning
mud and debris hurtling downwards

INT CANYON SUNSET

We see Aron in the distance tugging at his arm Without time
to register the wall of water hits him

INT CANYON SUNSET

In an instant he is engulfed with freezing water Gasping at
the cold wrenching his head to one side to get out of the
main force of the blast He tries to gain height but the
water is filling the canyon by the second

ARON
No no no no

His head is only just above the water level He is going
under Takes a last few desperate breaths before the water
closes over him

INT CANYON UNDERWATER SUNSET

We’re with Aron underwater in the churning dark waters
Only Aron’s head-torch flashing around desperately

Then in the maelstrom of mud we see the boulder shift A
thrashing of body The arm pulls tugs And then he is free

INT CANYON SUNSET

Aron’s face coming up roaring for breath Gasping choking
Alive And moving with the current He is smashed into one
side of the canyon and then the other

His good hand tries to grip onto anything but the canyon
walls are smooth holdless He barrels onwards a man on a
rollercoaster rolling smashing careering along the twists
and turns of the canyon

We are now underwater now above water upright upside down
bowled along as if inside some infernal washing machine half
drowning half living

INT CANYON SUNSET

The canyon spits out his writhing body into a wider valley
The water is slowing Aron’s body bumps its way to a halt on
a tiny ‘beach’ Motionless

CU ARON’S FACE SUNSET

Aron’s head is on the sand Grains of sand all over the lens
No movement For a long time

When we are convinced that he must be dead the eyes blink
once A barely perceptible grunt The mouth opens slightly
and water pours out

EXT WIDE CANYON SUNSET
Painfully slowly Aron rolls onto his back Stares at the
pink orange deep blue streaks in the sky Heaves himself

upright Looks down at his hand

Mottled white and grey a dead surgical glove at the end of
his arm

Aron gets to his knees His feet Steadies himself for a long
moment And then starts to stagger forwards a man learning
to walk again Grunting with pain and exhaustion

EXT STEEP SLOPE NIGHT

One-armed Aron drags himself painful inch by inch from one
step to another He slumps upright his head actually resting

on the rock eyes almost closed On some auto-pilot

He almost falls over the last holds Lies on the ground
staring up at the stars in the sky

A shooting star sparkles across the sky

CU SHOOTING STAR

A blaze of burning rocks white hot tumbling impossibly
through space

CU ARON’S FACE

A reflection of the star’s trail in Aron’s eye

EXT CAR PARK NIGHT

Aron is kneeling by the back door of his truck His face is
flush with the smooth metal actually against it A smile of
love He could be kissing it But he’s actually trying to
unlock it his face inches from the lock his trembling hand
wrestling with the keys Eventually he gets the key in
Turns it Bliss

EXT CAR PARK NIGHT

Aron is sitting slumped against his truck drinking the
bottle of Gatorade

CU of his throat as it gulps and gulps Gatorade is running
all over his face He can’t get it down fast enough It is
liquid pornography

Aron pauses to groan with sheer delight Looks down at his
useless hand Starts laughing and laughing With relief with
delight

INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

Aron driving One-handed The pain is coming in waves that
make him hunch over the wheel but he keeps going

Punches the radio Music crashes in on us A grimace of
pleasure from Aron

The occasional sign flashes past Seems to leave a trace on
his retina on the screen

EXT DESERT NIGHT
A huge inflatable Scooby Doo rears out of the darkness

From the driver’s mirror we see its inflatable body waving
at him caught in the back-draft from the truck There is
something slow and unearthly about this

EXT TOWN NIGHT

Aron is driving through a large town All the street signs
and shop lights seem extra-bright painful on the eye These
too are leaving a faint hallucinogenic trace on the screen
Aron is clearly getting weak

ARON
C’mon c’mon Nearly there

EXT SUBURBAN STREET NIGHT

Aron gets out of his truck Walks up the middle of the
street After what he has been through traffic is not going
to scare him Lit from behind by streetlights he strikes a
battered but heroic figure as he strides towards us in
silhouette Turns into the drive of a house

EXT RANA’S APARTMENT NIGHT
Stands on the step Gathers himself from the pain in his
hand Leans on the door resting his head Pulls back Rings

the bell

ARON
Rana

A light goes on A cautious voice

RANA 0S
Who’s there

ARON
Rana it’s Aron

RANA OS
Aron

Rana opens the door We see her standing there in all her
beauty Behind her the room is lit softly A fire burns in
the grate It is a vision of intimacy comfort safety

In slow motion Rana smiles at Aron She holds out her arms
to him

We see Aron’s face He is talking but no sound is coming out
of his mouth

Rana keeps smiling Steps to one side to invite him in
Aron trying to communicate trying to form words

Rana’s smile drops She looks disappointed Slowly slowly
closes the door

CU ARON’S FACE NIGHT

Aron’s lips are moving He is desperately trying to say
something

INT CANYON NIGHT

Aron’s lips are still moving desperately But he is in the
rope bag He never went anywhere Oh Jesus

He rips off the rope bag Wailing screams cries Finally
after so much control so much order this is despair Naked
terrifying despair A true rending of a soul gone beyond hope
for release or rescue into the darkest pit of loneliness
This is a man dying on his own in the universe

ARON
Oh God oh God oh God

Gradually the sobbing subsides He is slumped by the boulder
encased in his own pity Motionless for a long long time

Good morning America

There’s a chorus of Good Mornings from a thousand American TV
and radio shows from Texas to Oregon Massachusetts to the
Carolinas

ARON
Good morning everyone It’s seven
oclock in Canyonland USA Today
on the boulder we’ve got a special
guest- the self-styled American
Superhero Aron Ralston Shout it
out Aron

Applause from the studio audience Where the hell did they
come from

Flashes of Aron’s photos Hero poses on top of various snowy
peaks crags on bikes with huge panoramas stretching away
beneath him

ARON (CONTD)
Thank you Pleasure to be here

Suddenly Aron has adopted the role of chat-show host
switching voices and persona with frightening dexterity

ARON (CONTD)
Can I say a big hi to Mom and Dad
in Englewood Colorado

ARON THE HOST
Mom and Dad Never forget Mom and
Dad Right Aron

ARON
Umm Yeah Sorry I didn’t pick up
the other night Mom

(MORE)

ARON (CONTD)
Or all the other nights Would have
told you where I was going and-
well- wouldn’t be stuck here now
would I

ARON THE HOST
Well I always like to say your
supreme selfishness is our gain
Aron Anyone else you’d like to say
hi to

ARON
Sure Hi Brion at work I’m not
gonna make it in today I’m afraid

A big laugh from the audience

ARON THE HOST
A question coming in from another
Aron this one in Loser Canyon
Utah Aron asks “am I right in
thinking that even if Brion at work
did notify the police they’d put a
24 hour hold on it before filing a
missing person’s report which
means that you’d only become
officially missing midday Wednesday
at the earliest’

ARON
Right on the money Aron So they’d
get about four hours searching
before dark then they’d call it
off until Thursday first light

ARON THE HOST
And how do you know all of this
Aron from Loser Canyon Utah

Puts his finger to the invisible ear-piece as if talking to
the questioner down the line

ARON
Oh well I know all this ‘cos I’m
a volunteer in the rescue service-
I’m something of a big fucking
hard hero I can do it all On
My Own You see

ARON THE HOST
Yes I do see And is it true that
despite being a big fucking hard
hero officially the cleverest man
in Colorado and on course to be the
first ever to solo all the
fourteeners’s in winter- On Your
Own- you neglected to tell anyone
where you were going

ARON
That is entirely correct
A pause

ARON THE HOST

Anyone
ARON
Anyone
ARON THE HOST
Oops
ARON
Oops

ARON THE HOST
So just to be clear it’s just
you the crow and the kangaroo rat
in on this one

ARON
Don’t let’s forget the big bag of
piss

ARON THE HOST
The bag of piss ladies and
gentlemen Wooh

Applause and cheering echoes around the canyon as Aron picks
up the Camelbak toasts the imaginary audience

ARON
Thank you thank you

Suddenly utterly utterly sober he stares straight into
camera

ARON (CONT’D)
I love you Mom I’m so so sorry

After a long moment the screen is filled with static

INT CANYON DAY

A very sober Aron tips the Camelbak very cautiously towards
his mouth Takes a mouthful Retches But keeps it down
Summons all his strength and takes another sip

ARON
Oh

Retches again

INT CANYON DAY

Aron slumped A noise a swoop of wings He grabs the camera
just in time to catch the very end of the raven’s flight
along the line of the canyon

ARON
Shit Missed it 831 He’s late
Still missed it

We can hear his heart pounding Unnaturally fast He holds
his hand to it trying to calm it slow it down

A flash of a womans finger tracing a circle on his naked
chest where his heart lies

INT CANYON DAY

A distinctive rustling Aron opens his eyes The kangaroo rat
is back

ARON
Hello

This time the rat doesn’t scuttle off

ARON (CONTD)
Yeah what am I doing here Good
question In all of the places in
all of the world Huh Did all the
routes all the big descents Not
good enough Not hard enough
right

The rat looks back

ARON (CONTD)
Right Got what I wanted Got what
I asked for Everyone else is out
there And I’m in here Dying Real
cool

INT CANYON DAY

Aron is very still Without warning he suddenly tourniquets
his arm again Twice around the forearm knotted twice and
clipped with a carabiner that he twists up to tension

He folds open the knife grasps it in his fist and picking a
spot just above the rock’s grip on his right wrist he
plunges the blade into his arm Up to the hilt

He lets go leaving the knife embedded He swoons and stares
at it the whole picture going blurred for a moment Then he
grasps the tool and wriggles it slightly

The blade connects with something hard He taps the knife
down and feels it knocking on the radius bone on his upper
forearm

He puts his ear close to his arm and wiggles the knife again
We hear the thocking noise

ARON
Woah that’s bone

He pulls the knife out opening the wound There’s barely any
blood and he pokes around with a sort of detached curiosity

We can see the epidermis thick and leathery And the yellow

layer of fat Suddenly he jams the knife against the bone

ARON (CONT’D)
Aggghhhh

Pulls the knife out Wipes the sweat away So dry in the
mouth he is gagging Pulls the lid off his water bottle
Shakes it Drinks down the last precious drops

Holds the bottle above his mouth to catch the final drops
Licks the inside as far as his tongue will reach Screws the
lid back on Puts the bottle back down

At precisely five pm I finished
the last of the water The last of
the clean water anyway Kinda
gulped it down in response toHad
another go at cutting off the arm
It err- lets just say it didn’t
go that well

He swings the camera onto the bloody hole he has made in his
arm

Long pause

An even longer pause
ARON (CONTD)

Im really fucked now
INT CANYON TWILIGHT
Night is falling Aron is slumped in his harness leaning
against the boulder Perhaps for the first time we get the
sense that he has given up
INT CANYON NIGHT

The head-torch is weak almost dead on batteries Aron is
chipping at an entirely new area of rock This is odd

Then we see what he is chipping His name and the date he was
born And the date he is going to die He is chipping his own
headstone

Faintly we hear music Piano music Aron hears it too Stops
chipping

INT CANYON NIGHT

Aron listens to the music- a series of light innocent scales
with an almost childish tune attached Entirely at odds with
everything around him

A flash of a young Aron- maybe ten years old- playing on the
piano in a light sunny room

In between bouts of shivering Aron continues to chip his own
name Tries to hum along to the scales It sounds like the
mumblings of dementia

Another flash of the young Aron at the piano We move past
him into the next room where his Mother is working at the
kitchen table surrounded by piles of paperwork His Mothers
head nods slightly to the music

INTEXT VARIOUS

The rest of Tuesday night and Wednesday and Wednesday night
play out through the tripych Repetition is used to create a
trippy sense of losing coherence- sometimes there are three
Arons doing the same thing Sometimes it’s Young Aron or
the past or the present running on different sections of the
triptych at the same time

At key moments it resolves to one image and then back again
Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch
the loops happening again and again This is particularly
true inside the rope bag at night When his light is switched
on it’s bleached and monstrously overlit like cruel HD
close-ups Without water his disintegration is terrifyingly
fast

When the head-torch is off we establish a night vision of
green and blue that allows us to witness him in hiding The
images play out on the interior surface of the bag The
effect is like wraparound Imax multi-screen Technicolor

his face like a train We can’t see his damaged arm but it
is clear that he is free He keeps moving towards the boy
And the boy starts towards him running until Aron crouches
and lifts him laughing into the sun They are both so so

happy

INT CANYON DAY

The shaft of sunlight leaves the canyon Aron is left slumped
by the rock staring at the disappearing light There is a
calm smile on his face

INT CANYON DAY

Aron looks at his good hand It’s swollen like an inflated
prosthetic on top of his real hand Suddenly he has energy
He upends his rucsac with uncharacteristic carelessness
grabs the knife Rips off his shoes and pulls the sock over
his hand to cushion his palm Picks up the black rounded
hammer rock again Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at
the rock surface Smash Where has this huge energy come
from

ARON
I hate this rock

The rage blooms

ARON (CONTD)
I hate this rock I hate this
fucking rock

A small mushroom cloud of pulverised grit and dust erupts
each time

ARON (CONTD)
I hate this place I hate this
rock I hate this fucking rock

With each individual word he gives a blow The sock
disintegrates under the battering But he is oblivious He
stops hammering His fingers are paralysed fused rigid
around the rock He pulls them off with his teeth and the
stone drops to the canyon floor

He pokes the thumb with the stubbed point of the blade On
the second prod the blade punctures the epidermis and there
is a clear hiss as gases escape The look on Aron’s face
tells us about the stench

ARON (CONT’D)
Get rid of it Aron It’s dead
It’s gone Garbage

ARON (CONT’D)
Aron you are not dying here You
are not dying here

He drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his
waist He takes it off and drops down again in a squat

ARON (CONT’D)
Yes Yes

He pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder
creating maximum downward force on his right arm Hard
harder His teeth are clamped shut No sound

POW

Like a gunshot in the canyon the bone breaks The sound
echoes He rises and looks at the bone pushing up violently
against the skin He touches the jagged edge No sound

Now he humps his body up and over the chockstone smearing
with his feet against the wall He pushes his body further
and further round the dark side of the chocktone with a
silent furious intensity

BANG

A second gun shot echoes around the canyon He’s sweating
heavily and yet has a euphoria in his eyes He checks the
underneath of his arm Yep another broken bone

He can rotate his forearm as if it’s a shaft inside a
housing

Still he makes no sound There is a high-pitched ringing in
his ears Nothing else

INT CANYON DAY

Picks up the knife Pauses with the blade above his wrist
Here we go He pushes the knife hard to the hilt in between
two veins in his wrist

Sweat pouring out of him His tongue flicks out automatically
to catch the occasional drop

Sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without
tearing any of the noodle-like veins He puts the knife in
his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his
right arm

Drops of sweat falling on the knife blade

He pulls muscle up nearer the surface allowing his knife to
slice and pare away at a fragment of muscle bit by bit It
takes a dozen actions each time the knife goes back to his
teeth so his free hand can arrange the meat

Sort Pinch Rotate Slice

Blood flows though surprisingly little He stops briefly to
twist up the tourniquet

Silence

INT CANYON DAY

He can’t cut the tendon no matter how hard he slices But
nothing will stop his addiction to surgery now He fold in
and swaps the blades for the pliers He uses them to bite
into an edge of the yellowy tendon Then squeezing and
twisting he tears away a fragment

Grip Squeeze Twist Tear

Finally he tears the last fibre of tendon Stares at his
handiwork With a sniff of satisfaction returns to his knife
blade

INT CANYON DAY

Finally all that remains inside is a pale white strand Like
a swollen length of angel-hair pasta The nerve

He touches it gently with the blade of his knife

ARON
Aaaagggggghhhhhh

After so long in silence the scream is shocking long and
utterly terrifying He’s stunned Stock-still with fear

INT CANYON DAY

He stares at the nerve The nerve looks back It’s like a
Mexican stand-off It could go on all day

INT CANYON DAY

Out of the corner of his eye the boy is there Smiling
patiently Aron whips his head around The boy is gone But
he definitely saw him

ARON
Just this

He pulls the knife in and pulls it towards him an inch two
inches It lengthens like pulling a guitar string
Unimaginable pain builds in his body until finally the nerve
snaps And Aron snaps

ARON (CONTD)
Aaaagghh
Retching slumps in a heap head lolling forward his head
buzzing and ringing with trauma
CU DIGITAL NUMERALS
The numbers flick fast There’s ten minutes gone in a flash
The numbers slowand stop
INT CANYON DAY
He’s back upright cutting sawing stretching the skin like
he’s a butcher using the canyon wall as his chopping block
Huge energy suddenly Sweat running in his eyes blurred
vision rasping parched breathing
And then he’s staggering backwards Free His hand just
stuck there a stump in the crack He stares at it He’s out
here And his hand is in there Weird
His head is swarming with colours his legs faltering like a
new foal He stumbles up to the canyon wall Stares close at
his own obituary
ARON
No Not yet

INT CANYON DAY
Aron is busy Wrapping his arm in the plastic grocery sack
and then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore around
his neck to keep himself warm at night He stuffs his arm
into the empty Camelbak pack and throws the straps around his

neck to make a sling

Packs his bag water reservoir video pocket knife Grabs
his climbing rope and heads off down the canyon

Turns Goes back Looks down at his feet Sees a tiny hole
that goes god-knows-where

Takes the watch out of his pocket

CU WATCH

The second hand sweeps past

INT CANYON DAY

He bends and drops the watch down the hole Looks up around
searching for somebody

ARON
Thank you

INT CANYON DAY
The motion and energy of the action movie returns

It’s like Ray Liotta’s final day in Goodfellas relentless
frustrating pressure of life again now he’s free from his
tomb Deeper and deeper he goes twisting and turning through
the scoops of sandstone his rope trailing behind him a
hundred feet We follow its progress snaking after him

Specks of blood on the canyon walls

The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep deep and
dark But at the end there is a glow of light pink red
soft getting brighter by the step He pushes forward the
rope whipping around the corners Faster and faster until

EXT ROCK SHELF DAY

-we burst into dazzling midday sun on a rock shelf perched
dizzyingly high above the canyon floor It’s a two hundred
foot sheer drop to the bottom Vast cliffs face him opposite

He drinks in the sun the space Looks over the edge Sees
Water A stagnant pool of green water

Turns back suddenly desperate rabid Is searching the rock
for something Doesn’t take long to find two clean shiny
metal bolts drilled into the rock Gets down on his knees and
kisses them as he were the Pope on new soil

Feverishly Aron unravels the knots in the rope Every single
knot must be untied with his good hand and his teeth Stops
suddenly overwhelmed with thirst and exhaustion Reaches into
his pack and pulls out the Camelbak Empties urine all over
his head He is licking and retching all at the same time
Stops Instantly

He can hear a noise We can hear a noise A shuffling
Zipping sound The rope is uncoiling over the edge running
faster and faster There’s only a few feet left

He lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time Lies
there whimpering

EXT CANYON DAY

Aron inches over the edge Difficult rappelling with one arm
but once at ninety degrees to the cliff face equilibrium
returns and he starts lowering his feet walking their way
carefully down the rock

But we’re not interested in his rappelling prowess His eyes
never leave the pool of dirty water and that is our focus
too

EXT POOL DAY

Still tied to the rope he staggers to the pool and buries
his head in it Dead leaves insects just two inches of
undrinkable water But he drinks it bathes his head in it
Drinks again The sounds coming out of his mouth are half
cave-man half ecstasy

Kneeling in the water he pulls out the map Gets up and
staggers off

EXT CANYON DAY

He walks shedding any weight that might slow him down
Carabiners his harness the rope all dropped behind him
without a thought

INT HORSESHOE CANYON DAY

Finally he comes to the Great Gallery A 330 foot long wall
with dozens of broad-shouldered figures painted and chipped
into the rock by strangers 3000 years ago

The heat and his condition makes everything shimmer He
wanders on

EXT HORSESHOE CANYON DAY

Seventy yards on there are three more alien figures- tiny
heads and elongated bodies Cave paintings come alive

He tries to shout but nothing comes out Another attempt
lost in the vastness of the canyon The figures are
disappearing in the shimmer

ARON
Help

The figures stop Turn

ARON (CONT’D)
Help

A terrible pause

ARON (CONT’D)
Help me I need help

The figures begin to run towards him We watch his face in
close up as they come

Tears come now as the shimmering figures shapes themselves
into the first real people he has seen for five days

ARON (CONT’D)
My name is Aron Ralston I was
trapped by a boulder on Saturday
and I’ve been without food or water
for five days I cut my arm off
this morning I need medical
attention My name is Aron
Ralston

They look at this refugee from a horror movie He is staring
at the water bottles hanging from their waist belts This
gives them a way into his world The moment is broken as they
hurry to offer him water He pours it down his throat
bypassing the swallow mechanism entirely

INT TV STUDIO DAY ERIK MEJER TESTIMONY

Erik’s English is almost perfect although accented and
entirely without humour His family sit around him on comfy
chairs in a tv studio There are clearly rather pleased to be
there

ERIK
We are the Mejers from Holland At
the start of the trailhead we
talked to a ranger who told about a
car that was parked in the area
already for several days and the
owner might be missing in the
canyon

EXT HORSESHOE CANYON DAY

Back now live as Aron wolfs down the cookies and organises
the well-meaning but freaked Mejers Aron is brutally
practical

ARON

Yes but no signal

ERIK (CONTD)

After a hike of five point three
kilometers to the Great Gallery we
returned after taking photographs
and suddenly heard a noise behind
us It was obviously the lost boy

EXT HORSESHOE CANYON DAY

ERIK
You should stop and rest

ARON
No we need to keep moving We need
a helicopter Who can run fastest
You Go fast Take him

Monique runs ahead with Andy her son Nobody for six days
and then people start turning up like London buses Another

couple

ARON (CONT’D)
Cell Do you have a cell

WAYNE
No I’m Wayne I have some medical
training

ARON

Is it okay to drink so much water

WAYNE
Sure so long as you don’t vomit

Aron drinks more and more He overhears

WAYNE (CONTD)
Make sure he doesn’t pass out

ARON
I gotta stop and empty my shoes
Youll have to tie my laces

As he sits his head slumps forward He’s absolutely
motionless Erik tries to talk to him but there’s a pop
in his head and he can barely hear him

ERIK
Aron are you okay Stay with us
Aron

WAYNE

Jesus he’s asleep Aron Wake up

Aron pulls his head up and sees in front of him a vision

song

coming from the sky Whirling and screaming dust blasting

everywhere A helicopter

EXT HELICOPTER DAY

Very subjective woozy camera moves as a strange slightly
formal man pops out of the helicopter He almost looks like
he’s part of the Matrix All of this seen from Aron’s
befuddled perspective

PILOT
Are you Aron

ARON
Aron Ralston Can I get a lift

The man smiles at him in a strange way

PILOT
I reckon so

EXT HELICOPTER DAY

Aron looks at the beautiful white leather seats before he
gets in the chopper Surreal He touches them with his hands

PILOT
Need a hand

ARON
Hand

The camera tilts down looks at his stump Back up to the
Pilot’s face It wasn’t some kind of joke after all Looks
at the pristine white leather seats

ARON (CONTD)
Leather I’m gonna make a terrible
mess of your seat

PILOT
Just get in buddy

The helicopter sucks upwards into the sky leaving Wayne
Monique Andy and Erik far below

down and towards us Its Aron fully recovered after surgery
Eyes open he pulls and pulls down through crystal clear
oxygenated water

EXTINT HOSPITAL ROOM DAY

As the helicopter and gurney staff transfer him into the
medic room he’s surrounded by vertical giants as he lies
horizontal for the first time in 6 days

Thank you for bringing me back

The most senior of the burly men says
BURLY MAN
That’s all your miracle days used
up kid You need to rest You can
stand everyone a beer later

Aron is greeted by medics Needles Care Machines Tubes
his side is his Mother There is sudden focus in Aron

ARON

The gurney is wheeling him away from her

ARON

Aron’s Mother from Aron’s perspective

MOM

She strokes his head so gently

ARON
Hey
MOM
How are you feeling
ARON
Okay

Youve been asleep for 2 days

She looks weary worn out with worry and love for her boy

ARON

There is applause from the crowd Aron raises his Margarita
glass in acknowledgement

ARON’S DAD (CONT’D)
And now he’s back he can darn well
fulfill his promise to his sister

Suddenly Aron snaps to What Then Sonja is dragging
pulling him out of his chair leading him laughing and
protesting as he realises what is going on He is being led
to a piano This is a set-up Everyone at the tables is
laughing cheering them on

ARON
No Sonja don’t do this I can’t

SONJA
You promised Aron

ARON
Yeah but-

SONJA
- the only butt is sitting on that
seat

And she plonks him on the piano stool Sits down next to him
Aron looks genuinely terrified Oblivious to what Sonja sees
in his eyes the crowd cheer the pair on

SONJA (CONT’D)
Oh my God You’re scared

ARON
Yes

This is suddenly not a joke and she realises it

SONJA
You can do it Aron

He looks at her She looks around at the expectant crowd who
are beginning to hush

SONJA (CONT’D)
You’re gonna have to do it

They place their fingers on the keyboard Three human fingers
and one titanium one

They start The note C played three times C C C
Tentative The crowd are silent suddenly aware that this
joke might not be funny at all

They’re really concentrating C B A B C D The music is
becoming clear it’s the piano tune from the film Big That
simple melody full of childlike charm

to flow

are utterly silent on tenterhooks On to the high notes

And onto the finish A J F E D Cwith a flourish as
Aron jumps the octaves with his titanium finger And Sonja
and Aron’s faces split into the widest of grins The crowd
erupt in cheers and applause as Aron and Sonja hug each other
as if they’1l never let go

INT ARON’S TRUCK NIGHT

Aron driving

EXT SUBURBAN STREET NIGHT

Aron parks up Gets out of the truck We might recognise the
street

EXT SUBURBAN STREET NIGHT

We definitely recognise it now It’s the same street he
walked up in his head- to Rana’s house

EXT RANA’S APARTMENT NIGHT

Knocks on the door Stands back Everything’s the same as
before but different Different colours different sizes
The memory street and house have become a real street and
house

The door opens

RANA
Aron My God

Runs at him and folds him a huge hug Keeps on hugging until
there’s barely any breath left in him And he hugs back
Finally she disengages and wipes the tears from her eyes

RANA (CONT’D)
You total fucker Aron Ralston

They laugh She takes his hand and takes him inside

INT RANA’S APARTMENT NIGHT

Rana is mixing a drink in the kitchen He watches her She
moves beautifully

RANA
My famous Margarita Coming right
up
Comes through with the drinks
ARON
I’m trying to change I am

changing It’s hard you know

RANA
You wouldn’t bother if it wasn’t

ARON
That’s exactly the kind of thing
I’m trying to change

RANA
Go figure Ralston

Serious now
ARON
It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever

done But I have to

RANA
Yeah

She gives him a very direct look

RANA (CONTD)
What about the climbing

Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking
prosthetic arm axe He clinks the points together She
doesn’t laugh maybe a smile

ARON
I’m gonna finish the fourteeners
this winter or next

RANA
Solo

ARON
Yeah

RANA

So much for change

Aron just stares She turns away Occupies herself with her
drink

ARON
I killed us I know that I’m so
sorry For what I did I couldn’t
accept it Couldn’t let anyone in

RANA
Didn’t have to be anyone Aron
Just me

ARON
I know

Silence

ARON (CONTD)
Rana when I was in the canyon
before I did it when I thought I
was dead I was hallucinating and I
saw this child a little blond boy -

RANA
Not Jesus please

ARON
He looked like my cousin Charlie
actually but way too youngnot
him Somebody else

Aron stands up injects some conviction forces her to
concentrate on him

ARON (CONTD)
I knew he was mine- my child- and
that this was what lay in front of
me My future

me Do you see I thought maybe

He looks at her She doesn’t say anything Her silence tells
him everything

But it’s not going to be you is
it

She takes his hands in hers smiles sadly

RANA
No Aron it’s not
ARON
But-—
RANA

- everyone who cares for you a
little bit of them dies each time
you go back out there

Okay Understood

Though it is breaking his heart Rana leans over and tenderly
kisses his cheek

RANA
I’m sorry
INT UNDERWATER DAY
His face pushing for the surface He surges up and out of the

water takes a huge breath of air We see he is right next to
the edge of the pool

EXT POOL DAY

There in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same
sofa as in the canyon On it and around it his friends and
family including Rana There’s so many of them they fill the
screen all looking at him

He looks right back at them and smiles

We see what has conjured the smile The sofa has lost its
crowds There are only three people on it now The real Aron
Ralston his wife Jessica and their tiny baby

The real Aron takes the baby in his arms

CAPTION

“Aron met Jessica a year after the accident They married on
August 22nd 2009 Max Ralston was born in March 2010”
The camera pulls back and back Above the sofa are towering
snowy peaks Above the mountains are just the first faint

stirrings of the stars
