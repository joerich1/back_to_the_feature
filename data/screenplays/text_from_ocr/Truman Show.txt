THE TRUMAN SHOW

A Screen Play
By

Andrew M Niccol

FADE IN
A white title appears on a black screen

One doesnt discover new lands
without consenting to lose sight
of the shore for a very long time

Andre Gide
The title fades off replaced by a second title
Were all in this alone

Lily Tomlin

INT A WOMB DAY

A fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he
gently floats weightless suspended in the amniotic fluid of
his mothers womb We focus on the unborns hand already a
tiny exquisite work of art moving towards his newly formed
lips He sucks his thumb

INT HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM DAY

A seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached

smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up

by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera Shocked by
the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room the
newborn fights for his first arduous breath Following almost
immediately a cry
From another angle we see the crying infant on a television
screen the individual lines of the screen clearly visible

MATCH DISSOLVE TO

INT CAR - UTOPIA QUEENS MORNING

The face of the baby thirty-four years later still crying
TRUMAN BURBANK thinning hair a body going soft around the
edges appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the
wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme He
cries without shame making no attempt to wipe away the tears

Pausing at an intersection in a quiet working-class suburban
street a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and
lands with a deafening crash on the roadway several yards in
front of his idling car

Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate Amidst a sea of
shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism

He looks around him but the street is deserted He checks that
all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for even though
the fallen fixture is far larger He looks up into the sky but
there is no plane in sight With some effort Truman picks up
whats left of the crumpled light loads it into the trunk of
his car and drives away

INT CAR - TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT MORNING

TRUMAN sits behind the wheel of his car unscrews the cap of

a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into
his Styrofoam cup of coffee Stirring it in with his finger he
burns himself

TRUMAN
Shit

As Truman drinks he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of
children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School
adjacent to the parking lot The sound of the children triggers
a memory in his head

EXT LONG WIDE BEACH DAY TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER

Unlike a conventional flashback the scene in his memory appears
to be playing on a television screen
A sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN runs towards a bluff on
the beach

The boys father KIRK late-thirties beer bottle in hand
flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline Suddenly the
father remembers his son He looks anxiously around The sight
of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his
bottle in the sand and run to him

The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father
comes within earshot

FATHER
(out of breath clutching his side)
Truman Truman Stop

Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his
father But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the
anger and distress on his fathers face

FATHER
Come down now

His fathers unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more
tantalizing The boy considers defying his father He puts

his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at
the other side One good stretch would do it

FATHER
(reading Trumans mind enraged)
No

TRUMAN
(sensing his father is keeping
something from him)
Why Whats there

FATHER
(unconvincing)
Nothings there Its the same as this
(trace of desperation)
Come down please

Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other BEACHGOERS

have stopped their activities to stare at him Reluctantly

he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks When he finally
jumps to the sand his father grabs him roughly by the arm and

drags him away down the beach

FATHER
I told you to stay close Dont ever leave
my sight again You gotta know your
limitations You couldve been washed
away by the tide

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN FINANCIAL DISTRICT MORNING

TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks
briskly down the bustling street A snarl of taxis buses and
COMMUTER traffic A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under
Trumans nose a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye

Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of
Cosmopolitan from the rack quickly flicking through the glossy
pages Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and
finding him busy with another customer Truman deftly tears a
portion of the open page and pockets the cutting

He guiltily replaces the magazine startled to find the
Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him

TRUMAN
(quickly recovering)
Gimme a copy of The Sydney Morning Herald

VENDOR
We ran out

TRUMAN
(hastily departing)
Thanks anyway

As Truman hurries away the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo
and instantly turns to the torn page It is a Lancome
advertisement with ISABELLA ROSSELLINIs nose missing

Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to
confront him almost as if he were expecting it

Passing one of the tall black mirrored buildings that grow

out of the pavement Truman glimpses himself in the reflective
glass He doesnt like what he sees and attempts to suck in his
gut but quickly concedes defeat The image triggers another
childhood memory

INT SCHOOLROOM DAY TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER

Once again the flashback appears to be playing on a television
screen

The sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of
a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or-
so other well-scrubbed uniformed YOUNGSTERS DOUGLAS the boy
next to Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty-
year-old NUN with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched

DOUGLAS
I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad

SISTER
(impressed)
Tell the class what a chiropractor does
Douglas
DOUGLAS

He helps people by fixing their backs
Sister Olivia

SISTER
Thats right Douglas
(holding her back hamming it up)
Perhaps Ill be your first patient

The CLASS titters Douglas sits down pleased with himself
throwing a smirk to Truman

SISTER
What about you Truman

Truman rises to his feet

TRUMAN
I want to be an explorer
(with reverence)
like Magellan

The Sisters face falls

SISTER
No ones going to pay you to do that
Truman
(with scarcely disguised glee)
Besides youre too late Theres
nothing left to explore

The class roars with laughter and Truman takes his seat

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN FINANCIAL DISTRICT MORNING
From TRUMANS POV we see that he is staring up at relief
letters that proclaim American Life and Accident Insurance

Inc above an office buildings entrance

A POLICE OFFICER walking his beat wanders in Trumans
direction From another angle we observe Truman from the
Police Officers POV - shaky handheld camera - on a television
screen Truman enters the building

INT INSURANCE COMPANY - TWELFTH FLOOR DAY

In a cramped cluttered windowless cubicle TRUMAN talks on

the telephone

TRUMAN
(into receiver)

Okay okay lets call it what it is
Im not gonna lie to youlife insurance
is death insuranceyou just gotta ask
yourself two questionsone in the event
of your death will anyone experience
financial lossand two do you care

A CLERK drops a large reference book on Trumans desk He
checks the spine - MORTALITY STATISTICS 1986 to Present

TRUMAN
(into receiver)

Hold on will ya

(to Clerk putting receiver
to chest referring to the book)

Thiss no good Lumps all drownings
together I need drownings broken down
by category

The Clerk shrugs returns the book to his trolley and continues

his rounds

TRUMAN
(returning to his call)

-just think about what Ive been
saying and lemmehello

The person on the other end has hung up With an apathetic
shrug Truman replaces the receiver He looks over his shoulder
and places another call

TRUMAN
(lowering his voice)

Can you connect me with directory
inquiries in Sydney Australia

--Cr

(a long delay makes Truman
even more uncomfortable)
yes Do you have a listing

for a Lauren Powers

(pause)
nothing listedwhat about a Sylvia
Powersnothing Thanks

Truman replaces the receiver disappointed

INT LOCAL ITALIAN DELI LUNCHTIME

TRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR
WORKERS As he reaches the counter the store owner TYRONE
has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a
meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll Truman gazes
at the sandwich skillfully under construction pained by his own
predictability

TYRONE
(nauseatngly cheerful)
Hows it goin Truman

TRUMAN
(deadpan)
Not bad I just won the State Lottery

TYRONE
(not listening to Trumans
reply as Truman anticipated)
Good Good

TRUMAN
Tyrone what if I said I didnt want meatball today

TYRONE
(not missing a beat)
Id ask for identification

Truman forces a half-smile

We focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash
register watching Truman out of the corner of his eye About
to depart with his sandwich the man receives a guarded rebuke
from the FEMALE CASHIER

FEMALE CASHIER
(a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing)
Hes right there Youre supposed to pay
when hes here

MALE CUSTOMER
(nonchalant shrug as he departs)

He never notices

We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped
sandwich from Tyrone

TYRONE
Hold on Truman I got somethin to show ya

Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that

features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus
Santa Maria moored in front of the Manhattan skyline Trumans
eyes widen at the photograph

TYRONE
(referring to the photo)
The flagship of Christoforoour Genoese
navigator huh I know you love this like me

TRUMAN
(averting his eyes with difficulty)
Not me You got the wrong man

Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays
the Cashier and exits

TYRONE
See ya tomorrow Truman

EXT CITY PARK DAY

TRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park
From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book To The
Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration

A TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches looking for a handout
Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich reconsiders
and gives him it all his appetite gone As the transient
wheels himself away Truman loses himself in his book

INT A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE DAY

Close up on an old mans face CHRISTOF Hair pure white
late-sixties a vitality in his eyes that belies his years

He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room
Outside the window a single palm tree swaying against a deep
blue Californian sky A news anchor-style earpiece disappears
down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears

Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television
monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman engrossed
in his book silently plays
CHLOE twenty-something androgenous-looking similarly-suited
joins Christof at the window

CHRISTOF
(never taking his eyes
from the monitor)
You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the
road Theyre pulling out a body You know
you shouldnt look but you do

INT A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE DAY

A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around

a circular conference table in a sterile windowless meeting
room All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of
the table anticipating a call On cue the phone rings and one
of the men after waiting for the second ring picks up

MAN
HelloIm sorry I got more than enough
insurance

He hangs up After a moment the phone rings again

INT INSURANCE COMPANY DAY
TRUMAN sits at his desk making a cold call

TRUMAN

(into receiver)
this isnt about insurance this is
about the great variable - when will
death occur Could be a week a month
a year Could happen todayA sunbather
minding his own business gets stabbed in
the heart by the tip of a runaway beach
umbrellaNo way you can guard against
that kinda thing no way at all

The prospect on the other end unimpressed with his pitch hangs
up Trumans supervisor LAWRENCE younger than Truman by
several years sharper suit sharper haircut appears around the
corner of the cubicle

LAWRENCE
(handing Truman some documentation)
Hey Burbank I got a bridge-buyer in
Stapleton I need you to cloes by four

Truman turns pale
TRUMAN
Stapleton on Staten Island

LAWRENCE
(sarcastic)
You know another one

TRUMAN
I cant do it

LAWRENCE
(insistent)
A half hour across the bay Sea air Do
you good

TRUMAN
No I
(searching for a plausible excuse)
I got an appointment uptown

LAWRENCE
This is a sure thing
(conspiratorial)
Theyre upping our quota You need this

Lawrence exits the cubicle Trumans head drops He picks up
the framed picture of his wife from his desk MERYL early
thirties a petite woman easy to mistake for frail He deposits
the photo in his briefcase and departs

INT MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL DAY

TRUMAN briefcase in hand ashen-faced stands in line for the
Staten Island ferry

As the TOURISTS and COMMUTERS impatiently brush past him onto
the boat Truman remains frozen to the spot mesmerized by the
scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock triggering

a flashback in his head

EXT LONG ISLAND SOUND DUSK TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER

The flashback once again appearing an a television screen the
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits alongside his father KIRK in a
small sailing dinghy

TRUMAN
(shouting above the wind)
Lets go further daddy Lets go further
FATHER
(shouting back)
Its getting late Truman

TRUMAN
(entreating his father)
Please

Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading
towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon

INT MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL DAY

TRUMAN turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide
of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry emerging back on the street
into the bright sunlight gasping for air

Gathering himself he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street
subway station Two COMMUTERS surrepticiously observe Truman as
he departs

COMMUTER 1
(commenting out of Trumans earshot)
I cant believe hes taking the long way

COMMUTER 2

Hell never make it

INT SUBWAY TRAIN DAY

TRUMAN stands in a packed subway car anxiously glancing at his
watch wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief

INT TAXI DAY

A taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten
Island TRUMAN keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across
refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor

EXT BAY STREET STATEN ISLAND DAY

TRUMAN finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do
condominium on Bay Street As he approaches the lobby he
realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his
suit jacket
INT CONDOMINIUM DAY

A middle-aged CONCIERGE behind a reception desk is having his
hair brushed by a YOUNGER MAN in his mid-thirties Anticipating
Trumans arrival the hairdresser fusses one more time and
swiftly departs through a rear door TRUMAN enters the lobby
and approaches the CONCIERGE trying to keep his arms tightly at
his sides to hide the perspiration

TRUMAN
Im here to see a Mr Hamilton

CONCIERGE
You from the insurance company You missed him

TRUMAN
When will he be back

CONCIERGE
Vacation Two months He waited as long as
he could You was supposed to be here by four

A clock on the wall reads 412pm

INT SUBWAY AFTERNOON

TRUMAN sits by himself in the rattling subway car defeated
The only other occupants in the train a TALL WOMAN mid-
thirties reading a pulp novel and two MALE YOUTHS late-teens
sitting opposite the woman slouching ogling her

YOUTH 1
(to woman)
You wanna read to me

His companion smirks

YOUTH 1
(more insistent)
You wannna read to me

The woman looks up unaware of the boys presence until now
She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book The
other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp

YOUTH 2
(menacing)
My friend asked you a question

The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and
holds it to her She looks around the train for assistance
briefly catching Trumans eye The youths also look in
Trumans direction staring him down daring him to interfere
Truman quickly averts his gaze

WOMAN
(reaching for the book)
Please

The boy returns the book to the woman but before doing so rips
out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt
pocket

YOUTH 2
Now youre gonna have to ask me how it ends

The train pulls into a deserted station Feeling vulnerable
the woman jumps up from her seat and exits The youths sensing
a chase also exit Scanning the empty platform the woman
realizes she has made a serious error Truman watches through
the trains open door as the boys corner the frightened woman
but still he remains in his seat

YOUTH 1
Were gonna tell you how it ends baby

One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it
in the womans face

YOUTH 2
Dont you wanna know how it ends

The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of
their bodies The woman looks again in Trumans direction
Again she makes eye contact eyes pleading

WOMAN
(screams )
Help Please help

The womans second scream is muffled as the train door closes
Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door There
is still time to act He stands up and half-reaches for the
handle but moves no further

The train abruptly pulls away leaving Truman time to see one of
the youths covering the womans mouth while the other reaches
under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel Truman bows
his head in shame as the train rattles on

INT SUBWAY STATION DAY
The train safely out of sight the YOUTHS promptly release the
WOMAN She calmly hitches down her skirt no longer afraid
The young men no longer angry help fix her hair and retrieve
her shoulder bag

WOMAN
Thanks

The threesome walk along the platform together as if lifelong
friends

WOMAN
(pondering the incident)
He did nothing

YOUTH 1
(shrugs suddenly more couth)
Physical violence paralyzes him Always
has

EXT TRUMANS HOUSE DUSK

The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home Beyond
the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy
Expressway

TRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife MERYL
pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry She has a
sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new
knife-set in a wooden block She kisses Truman affectionately
on the cheek

MERYL
(proudly referring to the knife-set)
I got it free with the tune-up

Looking over Trumans shoulder she notices a small uncut patch
of grass missed by Truman in one of his passes

MERYL
You missed a section

Meryl enters the house Truman restarts the lawnmower and
obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn As
the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass
Truman pulls back abruptly He checks the kitchen window for
Meryl and wheels the mower away leaving the patch uncut

INT TRUMANS HOUSE - KITCHEN DAY
MERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters

TRUMAN
(referring to her hands)
Do they hurt

MERYL
I was afraid Id seize up during cross
One of the keys kept sticking

Truman picks up Meryls newspaper and skims idly through it He
notes an article headlined SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK

TRUMAN
(referring to the article)
Is he gonna take the stand

MERYL
(dispassionate matter-of-fact)
No point Two eye witnesses saw him
near the dumpster where they found the legs

She flexes her arthritic wrists

MERYL
You gonna eat before you leave

TRUMAN
Ill get something out

MERYL
(sensing something odd
in his demeanor)
Did something happen today

Truman turns to her too sharply his guilt showing

TRUMAN
(composing himself)
What could happen

EXT UNOPENED FREEWAY NIGHT

An abandoned freeway project in Queens The four hundred yard
stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked At one end
is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air reinforcing steel
protuding from the concrete

TRUMAN stands at the end of the off-ramp with MARLON thirty-
two the kind of physique some descibe as fat others big
Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up
golf ball with a number three wood

Truman winds up and swings making a healthy contact with the
ball The ball arches away into the night sky lit by the
adjacent operating roadway From a new angle we see the ball
take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and
continue down the asphalt

Marlon tosses Truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred
golf balls - a ball initialed with the letter T Truman sets
the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into
his second shot With a slight fade the second ball carries
even further than the first

Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment
Marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot

MARLON
Ouch Whose nuts were those

TRUMAN
(opening a beer from the six pack)
Mine

Marlon tees up a ball of his own initialed with the letter M

TRUMAN
I gotta get out Marlon

MARLON
(mild interest only)
Yeah Outta what

TRUMAN
Outta my job outta Queensout

Marlon takes a practise swing

MARLON
Outta your job What the hells wrong
with your job You gotta great job
You gotta desk job Id kill for a desk
job

Marlon addresses the ball and swings A sweeping hook shot
that bounces off the freeway out of bounds

MARLON
(annoyed by the errant tee shot)
Sonofabitch

TRUMAN
It doesnt mean anything

MARLON
(still looking in the
direction of his ball)
Nothing means anything Try stocking vending
machines for a living My biggest decision
of the day is whether the Almond Joys look
better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths

Truman selects another M ball from the bucket and tosses it to
Marlon

TRUMAN
(adamant)
I gotta get out

Overcompensating with his second shot Marlon slices the ball in
the other direction A lucky bounce keeps it on the cement
fairway

MARLON
(skeptical picking up his beer)
Sure and go where

Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer

TRUMAN
(unable to disguise his reverence)
Australia

MARLON
(impressed)
No shit Where is Australia exactly
Near England

Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate He points to a
dimple on his make-shift globe

TRUMAN

See here this is Queens

(sliding his finger around

the other side of the ball)
All the way round here Australia You
cant get any further away before you start
coming back

(tossing the world in his hand

warming to his subject)
Yknow therere still places in Australia
where no human being has ever set foot

MARLON
(still dubious)
So when are you leaving

TRUMAN

Its not that simple Takes money planning
You cant just up and go

(heading off Marlons skepticism)
Oh Im gonna do it dont worry about
that I just gotta move slow Pick a
moment Bonus times just around the
corner Soon as I get a retaining wall
built on the back of the house I can
start thinking about selling upand Ill be
gone Up and away on that big steel bird

(as if to convince himself)
Im going dont you worry about that

Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond
his imagination

MARLON
I never knew anybody who got out

An awkward moment Truman once again not so sure of himself
He masks his doubt by teeing up another ball

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FREEWAY LATER THAT NIGHT

TRUMAN and MARLON wander down the empty freeway retrieving
the golf balls As they return them to the bucket they check
the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their
long-drive competition

TRUMAN
(slightly the worse for drink)
Tick-fucking-tock Thats the fucking
problem Marlon Im thirty-four Im
older than Jesus Christ

Marlon looks sideways at Truman It sounds to him like the beer
talking

TRUMAN
Where do the dreams go Marlon

MARLON
(picking up the last ball marked with an
initial T trying to ignore the question)
You win
TRUMAN
Im serious Where do the dreams go

MARLON
(humoring his maudlin friend)
Theyre still there Just buried under what
we settled for

They approach Trumans Oldsmobile Truman opens the trunk to
deposit their humble golfing equipment Inside are the remains
of the fallen light fixture

TRUMAN
(referring to the light)
You really think it couldve dropped off an

airliner
MARLON
(unimpressed)
Sure Its halogen You oughta report it

(quickly changing the subject)
You coming for a drink

TRUMAN
I cant tonight

EXT EATONS NECK POINT DUSK TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER

The lines of a television screen signal another of Trumans
flashbacks A small group of MOURNERS in black several openly
weeping stand on the end of a small jetty including the SEVEN-
YEAR-OLD TRUMAN dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit his weeping
MOTHER older sister RAQUEL and a PRIEST at the head of the
gathering

The priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath heavy and
cumbersome in his tiny hands He heaves it off the dock

MATCH DISSOLVE TO

EXT EATONS NECK POINT LONG ISLAND NIGHT PRESENT

A smaller more simple wreath lands on the calm dark water
beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later TRUMAN stares at the
wreath for a long moment turns and wanders back towards the
shoreline

In his work suit minus his shoes and socks he sits on the sand
He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and
points a corded microphone at the surf For a long while we
watch Trumans impassive face as he makes the recording of the
lapping waves staring up at the handful of stars visible
through the gloom

We focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse From the
lights POV through the green hue of a night vision camera we
observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water

TRUMAN
(shouting at the surf)
Im sorry Im sorry

INT DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

CHRISTOFs dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a
television monitor that displays the distraught TRUMAN at the
waters edge

INT TRUMANS HOUSE NIGHT

At the Formica kitchen table TRUMAN makes calculations ina
school notebook a bottle of beer close at hand MERYL appears
in her robe a glimpse of black negligee beneath restless She
throws her arms around Trumans neck

MERYL
(suggestive)
What are you doing Come to bed

TRUMAN
(ignoring the suggestion)
I figure we could scrape together eight
thousand

MERYL
(suddenly exasperated)
Oh God everytime you and Marlon--

TRUMAN
--We could bum around the world for a year
on that

MERYL

And then what Truman Wed be back to
where we were five years ago Youre talking
like a teenager

TRUMAN
Maybe I feel like a teenager
Getting to his feet Truman holds Meryl by the arms talking
excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were
courting

TRUMAN
Meryl itd be an adventure

MERYL
We said wed try for a baby Isnt that
enough of an adventure

TRUMAN
That can wait I want to get away See
some of the world Explore

Meryl gives a derisive laugh

MERYL
You want to be an explorer You mean like
all the other great explorers from Queens
You dont even have a passport Truman I
bet you dont even know how to get one

The words sting Truman turns away
Seeing the pain shes caused she changes tack

MERYL
Thisll pass Everybody thinks like this
now and then
(making one more attempt
at seduction)
Come to bed

EXT A NIGHTWATCHMANS OFFICE SOMEWHERE NIGHT
In a nightwatchmans office two UNIFORMED GUARDS drink coffee

GUARD 1
How can they have a child

GUARD 2
Its not gonna be his you idiot

GUARD 1
Why not

GUARD 2
You think shed go through with it
(reassessing his own opinion)
Guess I always thought theyd adopt

INT TRUMANS HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT

TRUMAN stands in the darkened bedroom in his Hanes underwear
looking down at his bed MERYL has fallen asleep waiting for
him snoring lightly Truman rests his hand tentatively on the
bed The surface rocks A waterbed The motion triggers a
flashback in his head

EXT LONG ISLAND SOUND DAWN TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER

As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen
The SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits on the upturned hull of a small
dinghy in calm deep water

TRUMAN
(plaintively calling into the mist)

His cries go unanswered

INT A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

Two OLD WOMEN seventies sit beside wach other on a sofa
against a bare wall looking directly into camera as they
talk Nothing else of the room is seen

OLD WOMAN 1
(playing amateur psychiatrist)
It left him with more than his obvious fear
of the water Its as if he felt his father
had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed
never to repeat the mistake He was never
the same curious little boy again

OLD WOMAN 2
Were all born with a pound of cocaine
up our nose By the time were eleven
it runs out

OLD WOMAN 1
Half the people I knew named their
babies after him

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN MORNING

TRUMAN emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the
newspaper stand He picks up a copy of Vogue and flips through
the glossy cosmetic ads surreptitiously tearing CLAUDIA
SCHIFFERs nose from one of the pages He returns the magazine
to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the
rush hour pedestrian traffic

Pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building he
glimpses the reflection of a HOMELESS MAN standing directly
behind him Truman spellbound by the man suddenly wheels
around to face him The Homeless Han is in his late-sixties
more well-groomed and well-fed than the average vagrant with a
serene smile on his face

From a new angle we see a two-shot of Truman and the Man ona
television screen The Homeless Man places his hand ever so
gently on Trumans cheek Truman makes no effort to withdraw
He is transfixed by the the mans eyes He appears to recognize
him

TRUMAN
(almost to himself mouthing
the word)
Daddy

Suddenly a distinguished OLD WOMAN walking a small dog anda
YOUNG MALE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase walking in
opposite directions along the sidewalk grab the Homeless Man
one taking each arm

A bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group
doors already open and before Truman can react the Old Woman
and the Young Executive force the Homeless Man onto the bus
Truman lurches after them but he is met by the bus doors
closing sharply in his face

TRUMAN
(to BUS DRIVER)
Hey stop Stop

Truman thumps against the doors but the BUS DRIVER ignores his
cries and the bus roars away from the curb He starts to run
after the bus colliding with several PEDESTRIANS who make no
attempt to avoid him

Stepping blindly into the street he tries to hail a taxi

A vacant cab suddenly switches off its FOR HIRE light as he
reaches it Truman pleads with the TAXI DRIVER through the
closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is
apparently oblivious to Trumans shouts

Frantic Truman dashes into a nearby parking structure and
grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised
parking attendants kiosk Running along the rows of parked
cars Truman desperately presses the car security buttons
attached to the key rings

A car alarm chirps and Truman turns in time to see the cars
winking sidelights He jumps inside a brand new BMW and guns
the car The PARKING ATTENDANT alerted by the squealing tires
appears from the Mens Room and attempts to wave Truman down

ATTENDANT
(cunning after the car)
Hey

Truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street
without looking causing a taxi and a postal van to take
evasive action

Catching sight of the bus in the distance Truman leans on the
cars horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists He is
only a couple of car-lengths from the bus

TRUMAN
(reading aloud the
ID number of the bus)
Two four oh six

Suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to
slow for no apparent reason Truman looks for a way around
but the cars crab across the street blocking any passage
working together almost as if they are running interference

TRUMAN
(shouting at the cars)
Outta the way Outta the way

The bus is escaping

Truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car scattering
PEDESTRIANS

The same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his
progress suddenly accelerate in unison anticipating his move
By the time Truman reaches the end of the sidewalk the cars are
clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam Truman
spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and
disappear from view

Fumbling with the gear stick he finally finds reverse but turns
to find a hostile group of PEDESTRIANS herded tightly together

behind the car leaving Truman with nowhere left to go

The car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath
PARKING ATTENDANT yanks Truman from the drivers seat

ATTENDANT
What the fuck are you trying to pull

TRUMAN
(cowering the fight instantly
gone out of him)
Im sorry Im sorry No harm done
No harm done

ATTENDANT
(feverishly inspecting the
fenders for dents he finds none)
I oughta fuck you up

The Attendant looks into Trumans terrified eyes
the better of him

ATTENDANT
Get the fuck outta here

They get

The Attendant shoves Trumans briefcase into his arms and
brushes him aside As he departs Truman notices that the
traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of

pedestrians has dissolved

EXT

Row after row of parked buses
administration office
begins marching down the first row of buses

BUS DEPOT DAY

number painted on the rear of each one

Marlon stops walking
there is no reasoning with him

MARLON
Whatre you doing
(gesturing to the office)
The man told you theres no such bus

TRUMAN
Hes lying Two four oh six was
definitely the number

TRUMAN
I never believed he was dead

MARLON
(trying to be patient)

TRUMAN and MARLON exit an

Truman continues his inspection Seeing
Marlon hurries to catch him up
Cmon Truman a lotta times they dont find
a body You know what the currents are like
in that water

TRUMAN
(shudders a memory
flashing in his head)
You had to see his face when that wave hit
He wasnt scared Marion It was like he
was expecting it waiting for it He
knew it was coming

MARLON
Why would he fake it
(trying to make light)
Hes not Elvis Presley

TRUMAN

(ignoring the joke pondering

the mornings events)
You know what was really strange about today
An old woman with a little dog and a
businessman walking in opposite directions
on the sidewalk both react like clockwork
They force him onto a bus against his will
a bus that doesnt normally stop outside
my building And when Im giving chase the
bus never makes another stop and I get the
feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians
are working together to make sure I never
catch up with it

MARLON

(sarcastic)
Oh so now its also the pedestrians and
the buses and the cars What are you
saying the entire population of Lower
Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding
out that your father staged his death to
pursue a life as a street person Oh yeah
that makes sense

Truman has no answer We see an aerial shot of Truman and
Marlon on a television screen continuing to check the rows of
buses Marlon still marveling at Trumans obstinance They
have come to the last bus in the final row Truman hangs his
head The offending bus is not amongst them He makes towards
the exit without comment and Marlon follows

Unseen by the pair we focus on the ID number on one of the
buses they have previously checked - 2400 A single drip of
black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit
EXT MANHATTAN STREET DAY

TRUMAN and MARLON drinking beer sit in the rear doorway of
Marions delivery van wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked
behind them

TRUMAN
You think I imagined it dont you

MARLON
I think youre missing your dad
(trying to be delicate)
The anniversary was yesterday wasnt it

Truman is surprised Marlon remembered Marlon nods to the
sidewalk

MARLON
You got sand in your cuffs

Truman looks down at his feet A small tell-tale pile of sand
has poured out of his tight trouser cuff

TRUMAN
Maybe youre right If only the old
woman hadnt left her dog behind

We see a flashback in Trumans head of the earlier scene in the
Lower Manhattan street It confirms that the old womans DOG
was abandoned on the sidewalk

INT TRUMANS MOTHERS APARTMENT QUEENS DAY

TRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mothers cramped fussy
doilyed apartment with his older sister RAQUEL late forties
prematurely grey Through a doorway the figure of his MOTHER
is visible asleep in bed despite the early hour Truman and
Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her

RAQUEL
Dont you dare go in Truman I just

got her off to sleep

TRUMAN
It was Dad I swear

Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare

RAQUEL
Well the next time he shows up bring
him over Until then Im not saying a
word about this to Mom and neither are you

TRUMAN
f it wasnt him it was his twin Can you
think of a reason hed want to hide from us

RACQUEL
know a reason hed want to hide from you
Look at how you treat us You live ten minutes
away we hardly see you from year to year and
then you turn up with this story so insane you
dont even believe it yourself Havent you
hurt her enough Truman She already blames you

TRUMAN
(incredulous)
I was seven years old

RAQUEL
But youre here and hes not Has it really taken you
this long to invent a story to ease your conscience

TRUMAN
Im telling you hes alive

RAQUEL
(snapping back bitterly)
And Im telling you hes fish food

Truman meets her unforgiving eyes Without another word he
walks out of the apartment

Truman safely departed the figure in the bed rolls out
CHRISTOF fully clothed relishing the danger of being so close
to Truman without being detected Raquels demeanor immediately
changes all trace of bitterness gone from her face she appears
younger posture more upright almost a different person
Christof hugs Raquel

CHRISTOF
You did well

INT DRESSING ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

A cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical
mirrored make-up tables At the only occupied table Trumans
contrite father KIRK is having whats left of his homeless
disguise cleaned from his face by a MAKE-UP ARTIST under the
watchful eye of two DARK-SUITED BODYGUARDS
From a mezzanine floor out of Kirks vision CHRISTOF and CHLOE
also take in the proceedings Behind their heads a monitor
shows a surveillance picture of an agitated TRUMAN sitting in
his car trapped in rush-hour traffic

CHLOE
Weve tightened security

Christof nods indifferently knowing the damage is already done
CHLOE

(referring to Kirk)
Why would he do this to us

CHRISTOF
Old age Sentiment You play someones
father all those years you are someones
fatherHe sees the way Truman is He

feels responsible

Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony
containing a state-of-the-art monitor and VCR Chloe follows
Christof plays the cued recording without comment We focus on
the screen

EXT LONG ISLAND SOUND DAY TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER

A younger-looking CHRISTOF sits in a motorboat in the calm
water of Long Island Sound Trumans father KIRK twenty-seven
years younger and a DARK HAIRED BOY Trumans age at the time
acting as a stand-in sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy

Two SCUBA DIVERS in the ocean

YOUNG CHRISTOF
(barking instructions to Kirk)
aS soon as we give the cue tack to windward

Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction

YOUNG CHRISTOF
The freak wave will strike from the
starboard side Remember you dont
go to the diver The diver goes to you

To simulate the wave one of the divers puts his full weight on
the side of the dinghy to capsize it Kirk and the boy are
tossed into the water While the boy immediately bobs to the
surface in his life jacket Kirk fails to surface After a long
moment he reappears with the second diver some distance away
now wearing a spare aqualung
YOUNG CHRISTOF
Good Goodof course on the day you
only surface once youre safely beyond the
coveTry it one more timeYou okay

Kirk is staring at Trumans stand-in clinging to the upturned
boat Kirks expression suggests he is not a totally willing
participant in the masquerade

The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirks uncertain
face

INT TRUMANS GARAGE DUSK

A cluttered garage dimly lit by a single work lamp TRUMAN
looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty
trunk under a canvas sheet The trunk is fastened with a
combination lock He deftly dials the correct combination and
opens the lid

Inside mementoes from his youth A HOW TO SAIL book a
stack of GREAT EXFLORERS magazines and beneath it all a
garment in a drycleaning bag Truman carefully lifts up the
plastic to reveal a schoolgirls lavender cardigan decorated
with pearl beading He puts the cardigan to his nose and
breathes deeply

Footsteps Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and
shuts the lid MERYL standing close behind

MERYL
Whatre you doing out here

TRUMAN
(turning attention to an upturned
mower on the garage floor)
Fixing the mower

Meryl doesnt look like she buys it

MERYL
(concerned)
Your sister called She was worried about you

TRUMAN
(matter-of-fact)
I saw my father on State Street dressed as
a homeless man

MERYL
(attempting to comfort)
I kept seeing my brother for years after he died

TRUMAN
(irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)
What do you want

MERYL
I made macaroni

TRUMAN
I gotta go out About a replacement
(hastily adding)
-mower blade

Meryl nods not at all convinced After an uncomfortable
pause she turns and heads back to the house

EXT CAR WASH DUSK

TRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly
washed Oldsmobile In the background is the warning sign he
has just ignored CLOSE WINDOWS LOWER AERIALS

Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender
cardigan and forces the bent wire into whats left of the
severed aerial

INT TRUMANS CAR DUSK

TRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street crowded on both sides
with PEDESTRIANS As he drives he tests his car radio
Adjusting the tuner knob he finds a station

FEMALE VOICE (from radio)
west on Atlantiches making a right
on Woodhaven

Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds
that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio
Distracted he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk

MALE VOICE (from radio)
God Truman almost hit Marilynhes
on the move again passing the Burger King

Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out Suddenly
there is a piercing blast of feedback He looks up and as far
as the eye can see every PEDESTRIAN MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER
along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right
ear at exactly the same moment

MALE VOICE
(from radio in distress himself)
somethings wrong Change frequencies

Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without
success

EXT DRUG STORE DUSK

Still shaken by his experience with the radio TRUMAN exits

a Drug Store with a small brown paper bag Out of the corner
of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right
ear with his finger He goes to say something to the by-stander
but thinks better of it

EXT REDLIGHT DISTRICT QUEENS NIGHT

HOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares
TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile the expression of
the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each
is by-passed

Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy
prostitute VERONICA wearing a platinum blonde wig She is in
deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL Veronica recognizes
the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window

VERONICA
Hey Truman Where you bin You bin
cheatin on me

Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger
seat

INT TRUMANS CAR NIGHT

VERONICA knows the form As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb
she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the
drycleaning bag on the back seat She drapes the cardigan
around her shoulders
VERONICA
Bout time you got this thing cleaned
(half-joking)
Dont tell me you bin makin your old lady
wear it

Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply Veronica
removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it

VERONICA
(examining the bottle)
God do they still make this stuff
Whats the Sell-By Date

INT FLUSHING MEADOW PARK NIGHT

From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park
CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Trumans Oldsmobile enters the park
grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe
the Unisphere Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces a
miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up
picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car

CHLOE
(into a flip-phone
condescending)
you see him messing with the antennawhat
did you think would happenlapse of

concentration is that what you call it
I call it amateur-hour
(sarcastic)
In case you hadnt noticed we dont get to
do it over

Christof totally unfazed regards his zealous young assistant
with affection and even a mild amusement

CHLOE
(as she hangs up querying the
smile that plays around his lips)
You think this is funny

CHRISTOF
The mask has slipped before Everything
can be explained

TRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car
unaware that they are being observed

CHRISTOF
(adopting a more serious tone
as he returns his attention to Truman)
Whats dangerous is that he makes the connection
between what happened today and the girl

We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge
of the pool surrounding the great steel globe
VERONICA
Like I say I dont normally do this
I gotta charge extra

Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills
Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as
modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain

hen she is ready Truman tenderly places his arm around her
houlder Veronica responds hesitantly becoming immersed in
er role She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the
ape of his neck Slowly both heads drift together but stop
ust short of their lips meeting agonizingly close So close
hey can feel each others breath barely a sliver of daylight
eparating them Then finally their lips touch in the most
entle of caresses

QadtupjpPPos

They hold the kiss for another long moment and then
simultaneously break As they look into each others eyes
Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing
a finger to his lips Then abruptly she moves out of frame the
cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste

From Trumans POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement
triggering a flashback in his head

INT HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR DAY SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER

As with Trumans previous flashbacks this scene appears to be
playing on a television screen However on this occasion it is
also accompanied by CHRISTOFs comments from his perch in the
tower above the park

CHRISTOF (VO)
Hes re-created the event on and off for a
number of years Weve never understood what
prompts him to indulge the fantasy or for that
matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy
to approach her in the first place

A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN carrying a stack of books spies
LAUREN sixteen going on thirty-five wearing the lavender
beaded cardigan at her open locker She is entertaining two
GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale

CHRISTOF (VO)
Wed noticed them making eyes at each other
for some weeks but never thought hed say
anything She was a year older wrote poetry
way out of his league
Truman obviously terrified musters the nerve to approach the
lockers The three girls look up surprised by the
interruption

TRUMAN
(to Lauren tongue-tied a strangled greeting)

GIRLFRIEND 1
(to Lauren as the two girlfriends
abruptly depart)
See you in class

Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends

TRUMAN
Lauren right

Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her
text books

LAUREN
No

TRUMAN
(ignoring her lack of interest)
Look I was wonder--

LAUREN
--I cant go out with you

TRUMAN
I havent asked you yet

LAUREN
Well when you do thats my answer
(softening)
Im sorry Its not up to me

TRUMAN
(summoning up courage from somewhere)
Why you married

Lauren smiles despite herself

TRUMAN
Im not asking you to have my children
just a pizza How about Saturday

LAUREN
(adamant)
No
TRUMAN
Friday

Lauren looks around the deserted school corridor

LAUREN
Now

TRUMAN
Right now We got finals

LAUREN
If we dont go now it wont happen

Truman hesitates

LAUREN
(impatient looking anxiously around)
Well what do you want to do

THE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT
SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED

EXT FLUSHING MEADOW PARK DUSK

The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the
Unisphere The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon

CHRISTOF (VO)
We knew we were taking a risk She hadnt
been properly coached but we were torn
Hed summoned the courage to make the
approachWe wanted to reward that Of
course she took full advantage

Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding
the steel sculpture

LAUREN
I never knew this place existed

They both stare down at the inviting water Lauren suddenly
throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another
thought She comes splashing to the surface Truman stares
down transfixed hy the shimmering water

LAUREN
Come on Come on Its wonderful

TRUMAN
(nervous)
II cant

Lauren suddenly stops splashing

LAUREN
Thats right Oh God Im sorry

She quickly climbs out of the pool dripping wet

TRUMAN
(confused)
Why Youve got nothing to be sorry about
Has someone been talking to you

Lauren wrings out her dress

LAUREN
(to the sky upset)
Get me out of here I dont want to
be here

Lauren starts walking away

TRUMAN
(confused calling after her)
What are you talking about Lauren Lauren

Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms forcing
her to face him

LAUREN
(distraught)
My names not Lauren Its Sylvia

Truman looks into her eyes and believes her

THE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND
RETURNS TO NORMAL

TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder
of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as
Truman and the hooker Veronica seventeen years later As we
have just seen imitated Sylvia and Truman kiss with great
delicacy Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips
with her finger

SYLVIA
In a minute someones going to come and
stop me talking to you

TRUMAN
(looking around the deserted park)
Who Theres no one around

SYLVIA

(covering his lips once again)
You remember when you were a little boy
you stood up in class and said you wanted
to be an explorer like Magellan And your
teacher Sister Olivia said Youre too
late Truman Theres nothing left to
explore And all the other kids laughed
And you sat down

TRUMAN
(incredulous)
How do you know about that

SYLVIA
It doesnt matter Youve forgotten about
that boy Truman You got scared Just
because something happens doesnt mean you
cant take another chance in your life

TRUMAN
I dont understand

SYLVIA

(looking over her shoulder nervously)
There isnt much time Just listen
Everybodys pretending Truman Everybody
but you

(pointing to the

buildings on the horizon)
Look at that project You think anybody
lives there Its all for you Truman
A show The eyes are everywhere

TRUMAN
(protesting)
Eyes Where

SYLVIA

(frustrated raving)
Everywhere disguisedTruman theyre
going to fill your head with lies
Youve got to make yourself deaf you
understand When youre afraid the most it
means youre on the right track Trust that
boy Promise me youll do that

Truman nods unsure of the commitment he is making
Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of
nowhere

SYLVIA
(scared)
I told you Truman

The car skids to a stop and a large MAN 40ish with a shock of
dark hair jumps from the car The man yanks the frightened
Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground

TRUMAN
(shocked)
Hey

MAN
(to Sylvia)
Get in the car Lauren

Truman jumps up

TRUMAN
(to the Man)
Who are you

MAN
Im her father

SYLVIA
No hes not Hes just saying that
Does he look anything like me

TRUMAN
Shut your mouth

The man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles
her into his car Truman rushes at the man

TRUMAN
Leave her alone

The man easily fends Truman off knocking him to the ground
He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth

MAN
(to Sylvia)

I told you not to come here anymore
(to Truman who is getting
to his feet)

Which one are you

Truman is suddenly struck dumb the doubts start crowding back
into his head

SYLVIA
(calling out from the car)
Dont listen to him Truman Make yourself
deaf Come find me

MAN

(to Truman getting into the car)
Dont bother Were moving to Australia
New Yorks done something to her head

The Plymouth roars away Truman stares after it and then
turns back to the cardigan left on the ground

CHRISTOF (VO)
Why did he say Australia Why couldnt he
have said New Jersey

EXT FLUSHING MEADOW DUSK PRESENT DAY

VERONICAS head suddenly appears back in frame beside TRUMAN

VERONICA
You want me to do it again I think I
could do it better

TRUMAN
(coming back to reality)
Nothank you

Truman picks up the cardigan They return to the car

INT TRUMANS CAR NIGHT

TRUMAN drives VERONICA back to her turf She smokes a
cigarette flicking ash out of the window

TRUMAN
Veronica what do you know for sure

VERONICA
For sure
(taking a long drag on her cigarette
as she gives the question due
consideration)
The nuns at my school they used to say
The whole of life is faith

Truman regards his companion in a new light He comes to a stop
at the corner where he picked her up

VERONICA
(giving Truman an affectionate
peck on the cheek)
On the house

INT HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR DAY SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER

Another televised flashback The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN
stands reflectively beside Sylvias open and vacated locker

CHRISTOF (VO)
We removed all physical trace of her
but we couldnt erase the memory

ANOTHER SHORT BURST OF FAST-FORWARD AND THEN THE PICTURE RETURNS
TO NORMAL SPEED

INT HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY DAY

In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD
TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy womens
magazines By tearing out individual facial features - eyes
nose mouth ears chin hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN
in the magazines advertisements Truman has been able to
improvise a composite picture of Sylvia

The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not
completely satisfied with Sylvias nose He toys with
several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one
He stares wistfully at the completed picture

ANOTHER BURST OF FAST-FORWARD

INT SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMANS HOUSE DAY

SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN enters the front door His older
sister RAQUEL has been awaiting his arrival

CHRISTOF (VO)
When he decided to go after Sylvia we
were forced to intervene once again

TRUMAN
(excited)
Ive got something to tell you Sis

RAQUEL
(adopting a low serious tone)
Ive got something to tell you too

TRUMAN
(unable to contain his news)
Im going to Australia

RAQUEL
Moms real sick

Trumans face falls As he enters the bedroom where his ill
MOTHER lies gazing at the ceiling we focus on his EXCHANGE
STUDENT APPLICATION that he has inadvertently crushed in his
hands

THE FLASHBACK SEQUENCE OVER WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH
THE IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SCREEN

INT TRUMANS CAR NIGHT

TRUMAN turns into his street but stops several houses short of
his own driveway and kills the cars engine In the light of a
streetlamp Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed
photograph of his wife MERYL But he turns his wifes face
away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame

Removing the backing he exposes the composite picture of SYLVIA
we witnessed in the flashback of his youth worn and faded by
the years With the frame on his lap Truman retrieves a
handful of paper fragments from his jacket Noses He tests
the likeness of each one in turn Unsatisfied that any of the
new noses is an improvement Truman tosses them out of his car
window We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as
Trumans car proceeds down the street and into his driveway

EXT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE DAY

Close up on a nose We pull back to reveal that the nose
belongs to SYLVIA seventeen years older than Trumans composite
picture - slimmer in the face wearing her hair shorter

She is standing at the waters edge on a long deserted
windswept beach several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the
high-water line In the background a solitary white
beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene

Looking up into the sky Sylvias attention is drawn to a piece
of paper carried on the ocean breeze The paper catches on the
mast of one of the sailing dinghys A page from a newspaper
carrying a photograph of TRUMAN in the street where he
encountered his father Sylvia retrieves the page The
articles headline reads TRUMANS FATE IN DOUBT

Spying a MAN late-thirties kindly face riding up to the beach
house on an old bicycle Sylvia secrets the page under her
sweater The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on
the sand Sylvia waves cheerfully back

INT BAR SOMEWHERE NIGHT

In a quiet bar a WAITRESS patiently explains her viewpoint to
the BARMAN A PATRON on a barstool eavesdrops

WAITRESS
She was willing to lose him if it meant he
could find himself
(registering the barmans blank look)
Never mind

EXT TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT MORNING

TRUMAN sits in his car about to lace his coffee From inside
the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium he hears the familiar
excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN Truman suddenly
throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across
the parking lot and into the school

INT UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MORNING

TRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area

It is deserted no one stationed at the administration desk the
corridors empty He runs down a vacant corridor pushing open
classroom doors as he goes They are all unoccupied

Finally he stands outside the gymnasium The childrens
voices can still be heard Truman takes a deep breath and
bursts through the double doors

The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder
in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape
of childrens voices The recorder is attached to speakers on
tall stands facing the ventilation ducts Truman stares at the
machine in disbelief

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN STREET MORNING

TRUMAN exits the subway still lost in thought He stops at
the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his
ritual search but his heart is not in it
He starts his trek to work pausing to stare at his reflection
in the mirrored building hoping that the Homeless Man will
appear at his side once again But no one joins him

However as Truman continues to stare it is the building itself
that takes his interest An imposing forty-story office
building a black sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of
reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world a
building Truman passes every day

As usual a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and
exit the buildings high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating
security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS Beyond security
are banks of elevators ferrying executives clerical staff and
delivery personnel to and from their floors of business

Truman abruptly enters the building He strides confidently
past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs

SECURITY GUARD 1
(to Truman)
Can I help

TRUMAN
(sneaking a glance at the
building directory)
I have an appointment at erDiamond
Enterprises

SECURITY GUARD 1
They went bust

The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block
Trumans path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind
and makes a dash for it

He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing
defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard A WOMAN
EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman The cause
of her concern becomes all too apparent Looking beyond the
woman Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator
car

The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building
Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that
the entire office block is nothing but a giant empty shell with
no floors above the ground floor

The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other
elevators are milling around a refreshment table sitting on
folding chairs changing their clothes behind temporary
curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator
cars Gradually they all turn to gape at Truman who in turn
stares back appalled

The Security Guards suddenly appear at Trumans side and take
him by the arm

SECURITY GUARD 1
You gotta leave

TRUMAN
(riveted by the equally-stunned
building occupants)
Whatre they doing

SECURITY GUARD 2
You gotta leave

The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an
Emergency Exit

TRUMAN
(not going quietly)
Just tell me what the hells going on

SECURITY GUARD 1
Were re-modelling

TRUMAN
Like fuck Whatre they doing

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN STREET DAY

TRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the
street

TRUMAN
You dont tell me Ill get you investigated

SECURITY GUARD 2
Investigate what Youre trespassing

Truman sees there is no point in arguing further His
shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY A thought
occurs to him

He starts to run along the street suddenly entering another
building at random An office block with a bank on the ground
floor As he skirts the bank he feels the eyes of the BANK
STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him Is he so suspicious-looking or
were they expecting him

Truman rushes to the elevators The lights above the doors
show all the elevators on upper floors Frantic pressing

of the elevator button gets no response Truman heads for the
stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way

OFFICIAL
You cant--

TRUMAN
(anticipating his response)
--I know

Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down
the streets of Lower Manhattans financial district Every
building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD
anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED
FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door

He feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS Is he simply drawing
attention to himself by his behavior Truman wheels around
trying to make eye contact with passers-by They shy away
Truman stops still his head reeling

INT INSURANCE COMPANY DAY

From the office window on the twelfth floor TRUMAN can observe
the glass building down the street He ponders the black
mirrored box LAWRENCE appears at his side

TRUMAN
You ever been into the AMT Building

LAWRENCE
(following Trumans gaze)
Not since they begun reconstruction
(referring to the file
in Trumans hands)
Whatre you doing with that

TRUMAN
(defensive)
Im going to visit a site

LAWRENCE
What for

TRUMAN
Because I never do
LAWRENCE
(placing a hand on Trumans arm)
Thats why we got adjusters

TRUMAN
(looking at Lawrences hand
on his arm)
You got a problem with me going

LAWRENCE
I got a problem with you not doing your job
Burbank You already screwed up once this week

TRUMAN
Let me worry about that

Truman exits with the report After waiting only a matter of
seconds for an elevator he impatiently enters the stairwell

As soon as he disappears from sight a grim CHRISTOF emerges
from a nearby office shadowed as always by CHLOE They
approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates

LAWRENCE
680 West 89th

Christof nods Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call

INT INSURANCE CO - STAIRWELL DAY

An out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of
the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path

with a large office desk they are attempting to transport
Truman considers retracing his steps then without warning
clambers over the mahogany barrier

MOVER 1
Hey would it kill ya to wait
INT SUBWAY DAY
TRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other
frustrated passengers He loses patience and suddenly
turns and runs up the stairs

INT TAXI CAB DAY

TRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no
apparent reason
TRUMAN
(impatiently to driver)
Is there another way Cant you get around
this

EXT A CHARRED APARTMENT BUILDING ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE DAY

TRUMAN exits his taxi and takes in the scene A partially
burnt building waterlogged still faintly smoldering Truman
checks the address on his file A small serious-looking BOY
straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk

TRUMAN
(to the boy)
When was the fire

BOY
(shrug)
Week ago

TRUMAN
How come its still smoking

BOY
Started up again
(dismissive)
Kids

TRUMAN
(referring to his claims report)
Says here it burnt to the ground

BOY
Wishful thinking maybe

The boy is wise well beyond his years Truman fixes him with a
glare

TRUMAN
Someone send you to tell me all this

BOY
(unfazed)

You the one askin questions

The boy casually rides away

EXT CITY PARK DAY

TRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park observing We
sense truly observing for the first time

A group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball A YOUNG
WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS An OLD MAN answers the
incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD Nothing appears amiss

EXT TIMES SQUARE DAY

TRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned
on Times Square Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of
vehicles flowing through the intersection

Truman stares down at the street contemplating stepping out
into the traffic However as his foot is poised the stream

of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier now appear to
be giving him a wider berth He steps off the sidewalk and

to an acompaniment of car horns begins to wander back and forth
without fear through the traffic confident that each vehicle
will take evasive action

Safely on the other side of the street he stands in front of
the window of an electronics store He watches a local TV
news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13

However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own
face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the
store window He shudders at his video reflection

INT DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE DAY

TRUMANS face stares out from a televison monitor We slowly
pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the
first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room
the size of a football field

The curved bank of monitors suspended by cables from the
ceiling gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile
Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from
all over New York City covering every facet of Trumans life
Camera angles from the interior of Trumans house his backyard
car subway station office the deli he frequents the seashore
to which he is drawn the park he visits with Veronica the
abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon many of the
locations strangely devoid of people

Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk its
illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom Facing the
desk several OPERATORS in high-backed high-tech swivel chairs
wearing the slimmest of headsets SIMEON a meticulous young
man with a penetrating gaze sits directly in front of the

largest of the monitors co-ordinating camera angles

CHRISTOF stands over Simeons shoulder staring intently at the
live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe
continuing to inspect his surroundings CHLOE hovers in the
background

There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the
production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first
time Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a
microphone on the control panel

CHRISTOF
Everybody stay focusedremember who
you are

EXT STREETSIDE CAFE LITTLE ITALY DAY
TRUMAN sits alone at the table still looking for a false move

A DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and
carries them into a Restaurant Supply store Further down the
street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an
electrical repair in an exposed manhole A POSTAL WORKER does
his rounds An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping
bags Everybody appears natural places to go

Truman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN

at the only other occupied table at the cafe We see extreme
close-ups as Truman scans the mens faces for any sign of
phoniness They are talking loudly making suggestive comments
to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys
Their behavior passes the test all seems genuine

Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he
has been fidgeting

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

The on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the rings POV revealing
that the small center diamond contains a miniature hidden
camera Truman suspects nothing

He looks up to find two well-to-do 30GGERS out for a lunchtime
run making their way down the street towards the cafe Truman
happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers He
springs to his feet and blocks the joggers path

CHRISTOF
(staring at the monitor)
Damn

Unseen by Christof his Assistant Director Simeon takes a
moment of pleasure from the older mans distress

EXT STREETSIDE CAFE LITTLE ITALY DAY

TRUMAN
(to the jogger with
the familiar sneakers)
Small world

JOGGER 1
(attempting to sidestep Truman)
Excuse me

Truman blocks the man a second time

TRUMAN
You dont remember Two days ago I gave you
my meatball sandwich in the park You were
in a wheelchair Same sneakers

An almost subliminal flashback appears in Trumans head
confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the
wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same

TRUMAN
(commenting ironically on his
new-found mobility)
A miracle

JOGGER 2
(coming to his companions aid)
Get the hell outta here

The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table
causing him to stumble

EXT WAREHOUSE - MARLONS WORK DAY

MARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van
TRUMAN hurries up to him

TRUMAN
Marlon Ive gotta talk to you

MARLON
(surprised)
Truman Sorry Im up against it today
TRUMAN
Ive fallen over something Marlon
Something to do with my Dad I think

MARLON
(looking at him for the first time)

TRUMAN
(ignoring the inquiries
about his health)
Its big Marlon You wouldnt believe

MARLON
(distracted)

In on what
TRUMAN

Theres no point trying to show you they cover
their tracks too well But Ive been going

MARLON
(still engrossed in his own problems)
Somethings definitely in the air My last
delivery a kid got crushed to death

TRUMAN

Marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes Truman isnt
joking

TRUMAN
Im deadly serious Marlon We cant talk

MARLON
(suddenly concerned)

his jacket pocket)

CHLOE hovers in the
suspended from the ceiling shows a

surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MARLON pulling into a beach
parking lot in Marlons van

The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control

facility where SIMEON continues to call the shots

all too aware

of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background

CHRISTOF
(marveling

excitedly referring
to Truman on the monitor)
I cant believe how much hes shoved down

That he

sensed the significance at aged seven and clung
to it so fiercely
Roman paces agitated unimpressed Moses mnore respectful

CHRISTOF
(gesturing to the clifftop on the
monitor pointedly excluding Roman
from the conversation)
You remember Moses it used to end right
there before the expansion

ROMAN
(unable to contain his anxiety
any longer)
Christof the cracks are starting to show

CHRISTOF
(reassuring keeping
himself in check)
Ill paper over them

CHLOE
(coming to the defense of her mentor)
Trumans had bouts of paranoia before and

recovered
ROMAN
(adamant faintly hysterical)
No not like this Its compromised

Becoming unwatchable
Too much for Christof He wheels on the young man

CHRISTOF
Fear Doubt Is that what you have
trouble watching Perhaps you dont like
watching yourself

Roman is stung into silence

MOSES
(realizing his colleague is in
over his head including Chloe
to save Romans face)
Why dont you two wait outside

Reluctantly Roman and Chloe exit and join Simeon at the video
wall

CHRISTOF
(instantly more comfortable in the
company of a man his own age)
Hes jumped the rails Moses thats all Well
get him back on
MOSES
You know why theyre so nervous The birth of
Trumans child is going to double revenue
For Gods sake dont let him upstage you
(indicating Simeon through
the glass walls)
Youve been grooming a successor

CHRISTOF
Hes not ready

MOSES
Him or you

CHRISTOF
(jaw setting firm referring
to Truman on the monitor)
You cant pull him back in without me
(more reflective)
Hes just acting out of character

MOSES
What if hes in character What if hes
starting to act in character at last Have
you ever considered that

EXT LONG ISLAND BEACH DAY

TRUMAN runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to
scale as a seven-year-old boy

EXT CLIFFTOP DAY

TRUMAN sits on the clifftop staring out at the view his father
had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years
earlier However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his
father described - almost identical to its neighbor MARLON
laboring crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop

MARLON
Whatre we doing here Truman

TRUMAN
This is where it started

MARLON
Where what started

TRUMAN
Things Things that dont fit Loose threads
False steps Slips of the tongue

MARLON
(irritated)

Make sense Truman You going religious on me
TRUMAN

(tears of bitterness welling in his eyes)
My father didnt want me to see what was over here
Whatever it was its gone now I never shoulda
listened to him that day I knew it was wrong

We see a quick flashback of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN on the cliff-
face twenty-seven years earlier

TRUMAN
There were a hundred people on the beach that
day Everybody knew what was going on except me

MARLON
I dont want to put you down but why would
anybody go to all this trouble over you

TRUMAN
Maybe Ive been mistaken for somebody else
(a memory triggered)
A couple of years ago I tried to get hold of a
copy of Time Magazine The week before an ad said
Next Week Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation

Marlon shrugs unimpressed

TRUMAN
A guy with the same name as me in Time
Magazine It aint a common name so I

looked out for it But the day it came
out every newstand was sold out No
library had it I even wrote off for a
back-issue Never seen a copy to this day

Marlon remains unconvinced

TRUMAN
Maybe Im being set up for something You
ever feel like that Marlon Like your
whole life has been building to something

Marlon looks skeptically at Truman He hasnt had that feeling

MARLON
(becoming testy)
A coincidence Havent you ever heard
of a coincidence

TRUMAN

Im a walking coincidence I cant count

em

No somethings happening Marlon Ive got

to get to the bottom of it

MARLON

(shaking his head in exasperation)
Of what Whyre you doing this to yourself

TRUMAN

Im scared Marlon Im as scared as hell
But Ive never felt more alive Its just

like she said
MARLON
(suddenly intrigued)
Who

TRUMAN

It doesnt matter She was too beautiful for here

Now Marlon is really confused

TRUMAN

Can you lend me some money A hundred bucks

MARLON

All I got on me is the takings from the machines

Why do you need it

TRUMAN
Im going away for a while

INT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE DUSK

The comfortably furnished room of a writer Walls lined with

in blue ink

pulls out a book a magazine falls to the floor

holds Trumans photographed face next to her own

books Desk overlooking the sea strewn with notes photos and
other reference material Sylvias name on the spine of several
published volumes Pages of unfinished manuscript handwritten

SYLVIA stands at a bookcase looking for inspiration As she

Trumans

headline Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation

Sylvia retrieves the magazine In front of a nearby mirror she

for a moment
imagining them together Then catching herself she quickly
lowers the magazine left alone with her own reflection

INT TRUMANS HOUSE NIGHT

We see TRUMANs disturbed face reflected in the screen of his
television set montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH host of
Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous MERYL wearing her robe
head against Trumans chest sips from a bottle of beer

MERYL
(attempting to open him up)
Whats going on Truman Youre not yourself

TRUMAN
(vague)
Maybe you just dont know me very well

INT DINING ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

CHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining

room with an elegant WOMAN thirty years his junior Playing
silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance
shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television

CHLOE enters the room and nods an apology to Christofs dinner
companion - a woman her own age Christofs companion shrugs
resignedly Christof registers Chloes thinly disguised
resentment enjoying the rivalry

Chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR Christof
wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as
he gives the television his full attention A commercial for
GLOBAL TRAVEL begins to play

INT TRUMANS HOUSE NIGHT
TRUMAN continues to watch Lifestyles restlessly However as
he goes to get up from the sofa MERYL starts to slide down his

chest towards his lap

MERYL
We could do it right here like we used to

The program cuts to a commercial break The commercial
is for Global Travel

NARRATOR
(from television)
Travelling Down Under Global Travel is
turning rates to Australia upside down Round
Trip to Sydney only 829 One way 465
Global Travel at Broadway and 44th

Truman perks up at the commercial while Meryls attention is
elsewhere

TRUMAN
(abruptly getting up)
Lemme go to the bathroom

MERYL
Dont be too long

Truman exits the living room However on his way to the
bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table He surreptitiously
lifts the platic-coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous
bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden

INT CHRISTOFS BEDROOM DAWN

CHLOE pulls back long white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular
view overlooking the Hollywood Hills CHRISTOF rouses from his
enormous round bed His DINNER COMPANION also stirs waving
coyly to Chloe as she modestly covers herself only mildly
perturbed by the intrusion Chloe switches on the television
set in the extravagent bedroom Playing on the set are TRUMAN
and MERYL still fast asleep in their own bed

CHRISTOF
What happened overnight

CHLOE
He couldnt do it even on the sofa

CHRISTOF
(smiling to himself)
God that thing of his must be psychic
(matter-of-fact)
He didnt masturbate

CHLOE
Not for the last two inonths

Chloe exits and Christof climbs out of bed

INT TRUMANS HOUSE MORNING

MERYL emerges from the bathroom ready for work surprised to
find TRUMAN sitting at the kitchen table

MERYL
(rubbing ointment into her wrists)
Arent you gonna be late

TRUMAN
I got a call in the area
(nodding to her wrists)
Whats the case Anything interesting

MERYL
(dispassionate)
Rape on the subway

Trumans eyes widen We see a quick flashback in Trumans head
of the two YOUTHS assaulting the WOMAN on his train

MERYL
Theyre guilty as hell but theyll walk No
witnesses Her word against theirs
(picking up her bag to leave)
Maybe we could meet for lunch today

Meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door
Truman waits for the sound of Meryls car to disappear down the
road and exits himself

INT COURT BUILDING MORNING

TRUMAN enters the courtroom building A crush of DEFENDENTS
FAMILIES ATTORNEYS and POLICE OFFICERS Truman goes to enter
a courtroom but a SECURITY GUARD blocks his path

SECURITY GUARD
You a witness

TRUMAN
Er yes
(suddenly losing heart)
No no Im not

SECURITY GUARD
Closed session

Before the guard can move him on Truman sneaks a look at
proceedings through the courtroom door window

He recognizes the two YOUTHS sitting at the defendents table
A PROSECUTOR is on his feet addressing the JURY MERYL is
working attentively at her stenotype machine her fingers
rapidly pressing the keys However Truman notices a glaring
omission There is no paper emerging from Meryls machine The
roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg

INT TRAVEL AGENCY DAY

The EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS inside GLOBAL TRAVEL are all doing
a last-minute primp fixing their hair and checking their
clothes Suddenly in unison they take their positions and
begin working As TRUMAN enters GLOBAL TRAVEL one CUSTOMER
looks up a fraction too quickly anticipating his arrival

Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk opposite a
female TRAVEL AGENT Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera
in the corner of the room he nervously obscures his face with
his hand

TRUMAN
I wanna book a flight to Australia

AGENT
Where exactly

TRUMAN
(believing she is being
deliberately obtuse)
Australia

AGENT
(a trace of condescension)
Where in Australia What city

TRUMAN
Sorry Sydney Sydney Australia Thats right

AGENT
(entering the destination in her
computer)

TRUMAN
(finding the question suspicious)

AGENT
When do you want to leave remembering of
course that you do lose a day on the way there

TRUMAN
(more urgent than he intended)
Today
AGENT
(reading off her computer screen)
Im sorry I dont have anything for a
week

TRUMAN
(suspicious)
A week

AGENT
(patiently explaining)
Its the busy season

TRUMAN

(paranoia showing)
You sure youre not trying to keep me here
You are a travel agent arent you Your
job is to help people travel not keep em
where they are

(pointing to the agents

name tag DORIS - Travel Agent)
Or maybe youre a different kind of agent Doris

AGENT
(showing amazing restraint)
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship
departing for Australia tomorrow But you
wouldnt want to do that

TRUMAN
Why wouldnt I

AGENT
I thought you were in a hurry

TRUMAN
(calming down)
Thats right

AGENT
You want to book the flight

Truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several

rolls of quarters from Marlons vending machines
looks askance at the pile of cash

TRUMAN
You were expecting me werent you

The agent

The travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket
AGENT
Its non-refundable

EXT SYDNEY AUSTRALIA DAY

CHRISTOF stands with a PRODUCTION MANAGER mid-thirties on the
forecourt of the Sydney Opera House its sail-like roofs soaring
above them Framing the background the coathanger-shaped
Sydney Harbor Bridge

PROD MANAGER
(unable to conceal his pride)
Happy

Christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod

CHRISTOF
(staring out at the pleasure
craft littering the harbor)
Can we contain him long enough

PROD MANAGER
I think so

Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the
harbor

PROD MANAGER
(anticipating his next question)
He flies at night Thick cloud cover to
disorient him Hopefully well knock him
out with complimentary cocktails pull the
shades down during the movies Hell never know

Christof gives another grudging nod of approval The Production
Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are
putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House
CHLOE drifts to Christofs side a Watchman TV in her hand

CHLOE
(referring to the surrounding scene)
Why go to all the trouble

Christof glances at the TV screen in her hand showing TRUMAN
sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA

CHRISTOF
He believes she has the answer

CHLOE
Why not just tell him shes dead
CHRISTOF

Its too late for that That wont satisfy
him Hes going to have to find out for himself
See it with his own eyes Right now he needs
something genuine

(rueful all too aware

of the contradiction)
Even if we have to fake it

INT INSURANCE COMPANY DAY
Close up on typewriting appearing on a page

Please accept my resignation from
American Life and Accident Inc to

TRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a
fellow AGENTs desk

TRUMAN
(to agent picking up
a dictionary)
Yours truly You spell truly
ley or e1ly

INSURANCE AGENT
I always write Yours faithfully

Truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at
the entry for a long moment He looks up staring into the
middle distance His eyes widen as something clicks in his
mind Suddenly LAWRENCE snatches the dictionary from his hand

LAWRENCE
Where the hell have you been Burbank
What the hells going on

TRUMAN
Thats what Id like to know Lawrence

The AGENTS in the other cubicles turn in their direction

TRUMAN
I was just about to resign Isnt that
a laugh I just realized theres nothing
to resign from is there
LAWRENCE
Listen dont bother with the resignation
Just get the fuck outta here

TRUMAN
(addressing the whole office)
Whyre you all pretending Huh
(gesturing to a computer terminal)
What is this a front for Why arent I in
on the joke Was I away that day

Noting two colleagues exchanging a look he pulls the computer
off the desk to get their attention It lands on the floor with
an expensive crash

TRUMAN
(hysterical)
Im talking to you Who am I

LAWRENCE
(taken aback by the sudden violent act)
You better get outta here or Im calling Security

TRUMAN
(mimicking)
Security Im calling Security

Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk containing
SYLVIAs hidden likeness Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence
pinning him to a cubicle wall

TRUMAN
You dont believe a single word youre saying
(to the assembled group)
None of you do
(suddenly talking to a sprinkler
head in the ceiling)
You hear me

We see Trumans manic face from the sprinkler heads POV
Truman stomps off down the corridor other Insurance Agents

giving him a wide berth He shoves computers desk lamps and
pot holders off desks as he goes

EXT MANHATTAN STREET DAY

TRUMAN steps out of the office suddenly able to breathe
again pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead

INT CONTROL ROOM SOMEWHERE DAY
CHRISTOF is once again standing at the picture window in the
dimly-lit control room where we first encountered him Behind
him the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze The
sky a cloudless cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast
day in New York City

SIMEON co-ordinating camera angles sits in front of the
largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of TRUMAN
stuck in his car in gridlock

SIMEON
(talking quietly into a
slim headset)
and back to the close-up

CHLOEs attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying
a freeze frame of TRUMAN reading the dictionary a few minutes
earlier

CHLOE
(to a hard-bitten Operator staring
at the dictionary)
Do you think he sees the entry

OPERATOR
Hard to tell

CHRISTOF
(sarcastic)
Why dont we ask him

CHLOE
(snapping back referring to the book)
I dont know how it got there
(to Operator)
Enhance

Christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window
We focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionarys text

of the experiences of Truman Burbank

etc) circa 1972)

EXT SUBURBAN STREET IN QUEENS DAY
TRUMAN drives erratically down a quiet suburban street
On the sidewalk up ahead he spies a YOUNG MOTHER pushing an
INFANT in a baby carriage

Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front

of the mother and child the car straddling the sidewalk He
has the drivers door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come
to a halt Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant
from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot

The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds
the crying bundle in both hands above his head

TRUMAN
(to the Mother motioning to the sidewalk)
Say my name or Ill smash its head open

The young mother frozen with fright does not reply

TRUMAN
(vehement)
Say my name

YOUNG MOTHER
(composing herself
reaching out for her child)
Please give him to me

TRUMAN
(screaming above the babys cries)
Say my name You know my name Say it

YOUNG MOTHER
(bewildered)
I dont know you

The commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across
the street watering his garden He drops his hose and hurries
towards the fracas Halfway across the street the old man
stops in his tracks as he sees the baby perilously poised in
the air

TRUMAN
(hysterical)
I mean it Im ready to do it
Whats my name

Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can
his arms shaking fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent
to the concrete We see a view of the scene from the POV of a
streetlight The young mother recognizing Trumans
seriousness opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes

TRUMAN
(entreating the young
woman tears in his eyes)
This is your last chance

The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on
the brink The young woman now has tears rolling down her

cheeks She is at a loss powerless
TRUMAN
(his entire body shaking)
Whatismyname

The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name
Truman arms shaking face red with rage realizes he cant go
through with it With everything he has he gathers himself
After what seems like an age he ever so slowly lowers the
child into the safety of the mothers outstretched arms

YOUNG MOTHER
(clutching the baby to
her breast without thinking)
Thank you Truman

Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the
young woman as if it is she who now represents the threat

He jumps into his car and slams it into gear driving over the
sidewalk and back onto the street The young woman and the old
man stare after Trumans car as it roars away

INT TRUMANS CAR DAY

As TRUMAN drives he stares paranoid at seemingly innocuous
features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror steering wheel
insignia speedometer airconditioning ducts - and peers up at
the streetlamps lining the roadway

INT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE DAY

A dozen-or-so of SYLVIAS FRIENDS including the MAN we have
seen before sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon
sun talking animatedly A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the
guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the
television set hidden away in an antique bureau

SYLVIA emerging from the kitchen is taken aback by what she
sees playing on the screen The MAN on the balcony catches
her look as she swiftly switches off the TV She gently takes
the childs hand and leads him outside

EXT TRUMANS BACKYARD DAY

TRUMAN staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden
doesnt bother to look up as MERYL approaches

TRUMAN
(referring to a distant
car on the expressway)
See that car way down there I bet its a
Suburu station wagon

Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car
Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by Meryl is unimpressed
Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game

TRUMAN
I predict the next four cars will be a
white Honda Civic a blue and white
Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing
a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender
and a motorcycle

Meryl doesnt wish to participate in the game and makes for
the house Truman holds her arm forcing her to watch He
turns to check his prediction A convoy of cars approaches

TRUMAN
Theres the Hondathe Dodgehere
comes the dented Beetle

Meryls attention wavers Truman tightens his grip

TRUMAN
Look damn you

Following the VW is a school bus

MERYL
(mocking)
Wheres the motorcycle

Truman is momentarily disappointed Meryl seizes her chance
and heads for the house Truman follows her inside

TRUMAN
(yelling after her)
Dont you want to know how I did that
Maybe you already know Is that it
Behind Trumans back a motorcycle putters by

INT TRUMANS HOUSE - KITCHEN DAY

MERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters

MERYL

(matching his sarcasm)
Nice of you to say so after eight years

TRUMAN

MERYL
(rolling her eyes)
Oh God Whats got into you

TRUMAN
Take a break Meryl
(a knowing almost foolish grin)

MERYL

TRUMAN
(irritated)

MERYL
(rambling on)

TRUMAN
Shut up

MERYL

TRUMAN
(catching her wrist)
No Were going for a drive

MERYL

Despite her protests Truman drags Meryl out the back door
and towards his car

TRUMAN
(as he shoves her into
the Oldsmobile)
For years Ive been saying I want to go
some place well now Im ready to go Lets
just jump in the car and go

INT TRUMANS CAR DAY

TRUMAN holds MERYLs wrist to stop her exiting the car and
accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking

TRUMAN
(as they speed down the suburban street)
I thought maybe Atlantic City

MERYL
(trying to mask her anxiety)
You hate gambling

TRUMAN
Thats right I do dont I

MERYL
So why do you wanna go

TRUMAN
Cos I never have Thats why you go places
isnt it Cos youre curious I havent

been curious since I was seven years old
yknow that Back then youd have to nail me
to the floor to keep me in one place

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

All eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track
Trumans speeding car

CHRISTOF
How long to take Atlantic City out of
mothballs
SIMEON
We could be up and runningthree hours maybe

CHRISTOF
Give me a number five gridlock on the
Jersey Turnpike

INT TRUMANS CAR DUSK

TRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New
Jersey Turnpike We observe the Oldsmobile on a television
lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead

TRUMAN
(a manic edge to his voice)
So much traffic this time of day Does
that strike you as peculiar

On the side of the road TWO MOTORISTS are arguing over a
minor collision

TRUMAN
(sneering at the sight of
the motorists)
Look at them You believe theyre
fighting I dont believe it
(shouting out the window
to the motorists)
Why dont you slug him really make it authentic

Without warning Truman suddenly exits the freeway But
his move is anticipated At the end of the offramp a pack of
cars suddenly appears Other vehicles fill the gap behind

TRUMAN
(to Meryl marveling)
Blocked at every turn Beautifully
synchronized dont you agree

MERYL
(incredulous)
You blaming me for the traffic

TRUMAN
Should I

MERYL
Youve never been on this road before
You dont know what its like
TRUMAN
(manic)
Thats true We could be stuck here
for hours Could be like this all the
way to Atlantic City

Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk

MERYL
What the hell are you doing

TRUMAN
Youre right Lets go back Im
sorry I dont know what got into me

Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike heading back towards
Queens the roadway now relatively free of traffic

MERYL
Would you please slow down Truman

Truman floors the Oldsmobile The car flies past the exit for
Route 276 He continues along the Jersey Turnpike

MERYL
Truman that was the turnoff

TRUMAN

Ive changed my mind again Whats Maine
like this time of year Ive never been to
Maine

(Truman looks up through the

windshield at a helicopter

tracking his progress)
Or lets just see where the road takes us

MERYL

(pleading)
Let me out Truman Youre not right in the head
You wanna destroy yourself you do it on your own

TRUMAN
(eerily calm)
I think Id like a little company

INT CONTROL ROOM DUSK

CHRISTOF CHLOE SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Trumans
progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically
circled to ease identification Christof jabs his finger at the
rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Trumans vehicle
CHRISTOF
(to Simeon)
What the hell is wrong with the carousel
Keep them together

SIMEON
(agitated)
Theyre rusty We cant keep up
(rueful aside)
We dont know where hes going any more

CHLOE
Oncoming is very thin

INT TRUMANS CAR DUSK

As he speeds erratically TRUMAN glances at the streets either
side of the freeway where he discovers a distinct lack of
moving traffic

TRUMAN
(to the anxious Meryl at his side)
Look down there MerylNo cars I dont

run into traffic The traffic follows me around
(excited by his discovery)
Were in a moving pack dont you see

Truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway

INT CONTROL ROOM DUSK

CHRISTOF
(enthusing)
Hes so close Its tantilizing

CHLOE
You want to pull him over

CHRISTOF
No police Not yet We shadow him
We dont want him to panic

CHLOE
Hes trying to outrun the traffic

CHRISTOF
Hes trying to outrun the world Keep him
on this route
(to Simeon who is consulting
someone on his headset)
Are we ready

Simeon nods Executives MOSES and ROMAN have entered the
control room They hover nervously in the background

INT TRUMANS CAR WESTCHESTER DUSK

TRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars
at a police roadblock At the head of the line the cars are
being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS who are also contending
with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS

TRUMAN
(to Meryl)
Its hard to go places isnt it

MERYL
Theres been an accident Truman We
have to go back

TRUMAN
No Theres no accident ItS just more stalling

Truman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER

TRUMAN
Whats going on

OFFICER
(grim-faced indicating the nearby
Indian Point nuclear power plant)
Leak at the plant They had to shut her down

TRUMAN
Is there any way around

OFFICER
The whole areas being evacuated A precaution

Truman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when all
of a sudden he guns his car and swerves past the barricade

EXT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE DUSK

In the twilight sun SYLVIAS GUESTS wander up the gravel path
leading away from the beach house the younger children carried
in their parents arms Hanging back from the rest of the
group Sylvias admirer wheeling his bicycle turns back

to the house As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against
the side of the beach house he looks in a window

Lit by a blue-glow SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television
playing in her antique bureau the screen obscured from our
view She is unaware of the mans face at the window

Recognizing what is playing on the screen the man regards
Sylvia with a resigned smile He mounts the bicycle and rides
back up the path

EXT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DUSK

Trumans car slides to a stop blocked by Hazardous Waste
vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant
the pursuing police car blocking his retreat TRUMAN flees the
car leaving MERYL in the passenger seat

MERYL
Truman Come back

Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in
their protective suits carrying detection instruments The
workers give chase in their cumbersome suits trying to cut off
his path to the power plant As he crests a slight rise beyond
the plant he is finally tackled to the ground However
peering through the long grass Truman is able to make out the
lights of a cityscape in the distance

INT CONTROL ROOM DUSK

CHRISTOF a trace of panic in his eyes turning to CHLOE

CHRISTOF
Did he see it

CHLOE
I dont think so

The reason for Christofs concern becomes all too apparent as
the helicopter passes over the power plant where the struggling
TRUMAN is being escorted away We see an aerial shot from the
helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline

INT TRUMANS HOUSE - KITCHEN NIGHT
MERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table Truman stoic

tears rolling down Meryls cheeks Trumans airline ticket
torn to shreds on the table in front of them
MERYL
Let me get you some help Truman Youre
not well

TRUMAN
(ignoring her tears and medical advice)
Why do you want to have a child with me
You cant stand me

MERYL
Thats not true

TRUMAN
(suddenly angry)
Dont lie to me

Trumans raised voice backs Meryl to her feet Truman follows
getting in her face

TRUMAN
Tell me whats happening

MERYL
(frightened but remaining poised)
I thought you knew everything What could
I tell you

TRUMAN
(backing her up against
the kitchen bench)
Youre part of this arent you

Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect
herself

MERYL
Truman youre scaring me

Truman looks in her eyes and with surprising swiftness
grabs her wrist and disarms her

TRUMAN
No youre scaring me Meryl

Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her
While pressing the blade to Meryls throat Truman starts to
march her around the room talking to the walls light
fixtures a mirror doorknob framed picture blank television

TRUMAN
Stop this now or I kill your leading lady
(to a lamp)
I know you can hear me

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

CHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN
looks directly into one camera lens after another ROMAN is the
first to crack

ROMAN
(entreating Christof)
Get somebody in there

CHRISTOF
(quiet but firm)
No

SIMEON
(siding with the executive
showing his true colors)
Shes in trouble Weve got to help her

Christof never taking his eyes from the monitor leans into
the microphone

INT TRUMANS HOUSE - KITCHEN NIGHT

We see an extreme close up of MERYLs ear Unheard by TRUMAN
from her inner car we hear a familiar voice

CHRISTOF (0C)
Hes bluffing Call his bluff

MERYL
(in reply to the voice in her
head half-strangled due to the
pressure of the knife)
Do something

Upon hearing her remark Trumans eyes widen Sensing that she

too is addressing a third person he jerks her head around to
read her face

TRUMAN
(wild-eyed)
Who are you talking to

MERYL
(incredulous)
Youre the one talking to the walls
TRUMAN
No You said Do something Who were you
talking to I swear Ill kill you if
you dont tell me

Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to
the bedroom but before she can barricade the door Truman
forces his way inside They both tumble onto the waterbed
causing it to rock back and forth Gripping Meryls hair
Truman throws aside the bed covers

TRUMAN
(distraught referring to the bed)
How could you buy this damn thing when you
know he drowned in front of me

Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl
begins to slash viciously at the waterbed opening a large gash

TRUMAN
You have any idea what its like to drown

Truman drops the knife and forces Meryls head into the gaping
hole in the bed submerging her head in the tepid water She
thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself

Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water

MERYL
(gasping for air)
Truman stop it
(to the ceiling)
Dont let him do it

TRUMAN
(to a light fixture threatening)
Tll kill her

He dunks her head into the water a second time holding her
head down longer this time She continues to struggle

Suddenly the front door chimes Startled Truman lets Meryl up
for air

TRUMAN
(sneering at Meryl)

Right on time Cops must be telepathic

Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats
her to it Grabbing the knife by the blade he slices his hand

TRUMAN
(wincing in pain)
Damn

At knifepoint Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the
front door The doorbell chimes a second and third time more
insistently

TRUMAN
(shouting through the closed door)
Stay where you are or Ill kill her

MARLON (0C)
Truman Its me Marlon

Truman flinches He was so convinced it would be the police
He takes a step back against the hallway wall Before he can
decide what to do Marlon has opened the unlocked front door
to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to
Meryls throat blood streaming from his own wound

Marlon locks eyes on Truman Sizing up the situation he slowly
but decisively removes the knife from Trumans hand Meryl
wrenches herself free from Trumans now limp grasp and
collapses into Marlons arms sobbing

MERYL
(distraught dropping character
forgetting herself)
They were going to let him kill me

EXT ABANDONED FREEWAY NIGHT

MARLON and TRUMAN both nursing bottles of beer sit on the end
of their abandoned freeway off-ramp

TRUMAN
People know who I am my every move complete
strangers know my name Even when theres

no one around I feel the eyes on me

MARLON
(reluctant admission)
I was in the bank today The Federal on
Lewis A clerk was talking about somebody
named Truman messing with her baby Is that
the stranger youre talking about

Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation

TRUMAN
(half to himself refusing to accept it)
No No Ive never seen her before
(registering Marlons skepticism)

I know you already think Im going out

of my mind but I genuinely believe the

world revolves around me somehow Everybody

seems to be in on it

MARLON
Its a lot of world for one man You sure
thats not wishful thinking you wishing
youd made something more of yourself Christ
Truman who hasnt sat on the John and had
an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters
Who hasnt wanted to be somebody

TRUMAN
Thats just it I think I am somebody

MARLON
(sympathetizing)
I used to dream all my friends and family
got together in a hotel room thinking of
ways to fuck me up

TRUMAN
Sometimes I think its in my head sometimes
I think its for real

Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere
in the night

MARLON
ru weve known each other since before
we could get a hard-on

fq

Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark

MARLON

The only way we ever made it through

high school was cheating off each others
test papers Jesus they were identical
always liked that because whatever the
answer was we was right together and we

was wrong together

fq

Truman nods fondly at the memory

MARLON
The only night either of us ever spent
in jail we spent together and I wet
myself but you never told anyone
I was best man at your wedding and my
brother was best man at my wedding and
you didnt talk to me for a month over
that and I didnt blame you because youve
been more of a brother to me than hes
ever been And I never shoulda let

my Goddam father talk me into that

Truman is slowly coming around Marlons speech from the heart
soothing away his pain

MARLON
I know things havent worked out for
either of us like we used to sit up on
Freemont Street all night and dream they
would We all let opportunities pass us
by none of us asks for the dance as
often as we should I know that feeling
when its like everythings slipping away
and you dont want to believe it so you
look for answers someplace else But
well the point is I would gladly step
in front of traffic for you

Truman grins a melancholy grin nearly all the way back We see
a close up of Marlons ear From inside unheard by Truman
CHRISTOF dictates Marlons heartfelt speech

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

CHRISTOF leans over a microphone at the mixing desk feeding the
lines to Marlon immersed in the role

CHRISTOF
(hushed tones)
and the last thing Id ever do is
lie to you

Recognizing the importance of the moment his colleagues stand
around in awe at Christofs spontaneous performance arguably
superior to Marlons own delivery

MARLON
(staring into Trumans
eyes repeating the
words in his ear)
And the last thing Id ever do is lie to you
(pause)
Think about it Truman if everybodys
in on it Id have to be in on it too
Im not in on it cos there is no it
Trumans head slowly drops in surrender his doubts draining
away Marlon embraces Truman in a bearhug

Truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star
shines

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

From his chair CHRISTOF modestly accepts the congratulations of
his COLLEAGUES The two executives MOSES and ROMAN are at the
head of the line their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten
CHLOE gives Christof a warm hug

MARLON accepting a towel from a PA still in wardrobe

approaches and kneels beside the arm of Christofs chair
grasping his hand

MARLON
(leaving his head close to
Christof)
I cant thank you enough I dont know
what happened He was so close It threw

me Im indebted

Christof gives Marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and
Marlon withdraws

Finally Christofs Assistant Director SIMEON approaches and
offers his hand Christof hesitates before shaking Simeon
returns to the monitors now showing TRUMAN alone at the dock or
Long Island Christof stares out the window to conceal an
expression of quiet vindication

INT A LTVING ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before sit on their sofa
gazing straight ahead On the teievision in front of them
a live picture of TRUMAN - the first time we have seen him
broadcast to a viewers set

He is reading a book at his kitchen table unaware of the
cameras recording him

The scene alternates between a wide master shot a medium tight
shot a close up of Trumans face and two insert shots - one
over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from
another angle showing the books title To The Ends Of The
Earth - The Age Of Exploration
At one point a sponsors border appears on screen tastefully
framing the action with the message FOLGERS Coffee - Good To
The Last Drop After several seconds the border disappears

Suddenly tbe live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on the
screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around
the edge of the image Overlapping scenes from Trumans life
appear in chronological order from infancy to adolescence and
finally adulthood A graphic TRUMAN - Total Record Of A Human
Life appears on screen accompanied by an introductory
narration

NARRATOR (0C)
You are watching Truman - Total Record Of
A Human Life Everything that occurs here
is real There are no re-creations or
interruptions Due to the live and unedited
nature of the program viewer discretion is
advised

The title sequence is replaced by an INTERVIEWER mid-fifties
conservative suit and hair sitting opposite CHRISTOF in a Larry
King-style interview setting Projected in the background is
the live picture of Truman immersed in his book

INT STUDIO NIGHT

INTERVIEWER

(to camera)
Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty
eight of Truman and there can scarcely have
been a more momentous week in the shows
history Im your host Michael Conners and
this is a special edition of Tru Talk the
forum where we discuss and analyze recent
events with the shows award-winning creator
and producer Christof

(referring to the image

of Truman in the background)
I remind viewers that as this is a living
history it is our practise to keep the image
of Truman on screen at all times

(turning to Christof)
Welcome

CHRISTOF
Thank you

INTERVIEWER
Before we start taking calls the huge surge in
ratings over the last few days how do you hope
to sustain that audience now that Truman appears
to have reconciled himself returned to normal

CHRISTOF
Ratings have never been our primary goal I
imagine well lose those voycurs only interested
in witnessing Trumans latest torment However
Im certain our core audience will remain loyal

INTERVIEWER
But recent events have been so dramatic it does
raise the perennial question What keeps us
watching one man twenty-four hours a day -
eating sleeping working sitting for hours in
contemplation

CHRISTOF
It has to be the reality

During this segment we cut to a cross-section of VIEWERS -
the NIGHTWATCHMEN the two OLD WOMEN on their sofa the
BARMAN and the WAITRESS - listening to Christofs theories on
their viewing habits

CHRISTOF
Weve become increasingly frustrated watching
actors give us phony emotions bored with
pyrotechnics and special effects While the
world he inhabits is counterfeit theres
nothing fake about Truman himself No scripts
no cue cards Its not always Shakespeare but
its genuine Thats how he can support an
entire channel

INTERVIEWER
A window onto the human condition

CHRISTOF
I prefer to think of it as a mirror Not only
does he give us a glimpse of the truth he
gives us a glimpse of ourselves

INTERVIEWER
But how do you account for the popularity of
those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps

CHRISTOF
We find many viewers leave him on all night
for comfort Havent you ever watched your
child or your lover sleep

INTERVIEWER
Lets go to some of those viewers calls

The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his
desks high-tech phone terminal

INTERVIEWER
(into speaker phone)
Charlotte North Carolina for Christof

MALE CALLER 1 (0C)
Hello

INTERVIEWER
Youre on caller Go ahead

MALE CALLER 1
Christof its a great honor to speak with you

CHRISTOF
Thank you

MALE CALLER 1
Truman has never been closer The way he looked
directly at us spoke to us for the first time
Do you think hell ever work it out

CHRISTOF
I dont believe so Not now He tested his
world as we all do at certain times and
eventually it passed the test You have to
understand he is a man made-for-TV the world
he occupies his only frame of reference
No for him to come even this close to the
truth is a remarkable testament to his
instincts

The Interviewer presses another line on his terminal

INTERVIEWER
Sacramento California youre on Tru Talk

MALE CALLER 2 (0C)
How much of a strain has the last few days
placed on the actors

CHRISTOF
Working on Truman has always been a huge
commitment for an actor not just in terms
of separation from friends and family but
since Truman essentially drives the plot
its a never-ending improvisation Recent
events have raised the pressure but also the
prestige

INTERVIEWER
(cutting off the call)
Of course Truman has always been very much in on
casting

CHRISTOF
As with our own lives the only people he cant
cast are his family Otherwise he has final
approval able to elevate an extra into a lead
role as was the case with his only real friend
Marlon or alternatively relegate a star to a bit
player

INTERVIEWER
(pressing another line)
Istanbul Turkey youre on with world-renowned
videographer Christof

MALE CALLER 3 (0C)
Christof Ive admired your work my whole life
although I cant say Ive seen it all

CHRISTOF
Who can

MALE CALLER 3
Can you settle an argument for me Whats
the longest time Truman has been off-camera

CHRISTOF
(trace of pride)
In his entire life forty-two minutes A
technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of
that time The remainder generally results
from blindspots in the early days when Truman
would stray out of range of our cameras

INTERVIEWER
The Hague for ChristofThe Haguelost them
(pressing another line)
Amagansett Long Island youre on Tru Talk

FEMALE CALLER 1 (0C)
How can you say Truman lives a life like any other

CHRISTOF
(sensing the thinly disguised
resentinent in the callers voice)
I believe that to be so I often feel the only
difference between Trumans life and our own
is that his is being more thoroughly documented
We all play our allotted roles--

FEMALE CALLER 1 (0C)
--Hes not a performer Hes a prisoner

The Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof
holds him back

CHRISTOF
(rising to the challenge)

--He can leave at any time If his was more
than just a vague ambition if he were
absolutely determined to discover the truth
theres no way we could prevent him I think
what really distresses you caller is that
ultimately he prefers the comfort of his cell--

FEMALE CALLER 1
(as if trying to convince herself
giving herself away)
--No youre wrong Hell prove you wrong
He can still do it

CHRISTOF
(a thought occurring looking
directly into camera)
Do I know you caller Your voice sounds familiar

INT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE NIGHT

SYLVIA finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off
the call stares at CHRISTOF on her television screen

It is she who is the Female Caller Christof seems to stare
back at her as the talk show continues

INTERVIEWER
(from television)
Recording a human life from birth to death
thats still the intention You still believe
Truman has more to contribute

CHRISTOF
(still reflecting on the last call)
More than ever By unwittingly allowing us to
witness his struggles hes constantly forcing
us to evaluate our own lives He gives us hope

INTERVIEWER
Lets take another call
(pressing a line)
London England youre on Tru Talk

FEMALE CALLER 2
By definition Truman has to be free of censorship
but has the recent violence and profanity
caused a problem for the sponsors

Sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television focusing on
the window that displays TRUMAN still buried in his book

She comes close to the screen catching his melancholy She
has a camera and a white envelope in her hand With a look of
resolve she takes her fountain pen and writes Trumans name
on the envelope in her familiar blue ink

INT MASTER TAPE ROOM NIGHT

Row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire
cavernous room - Truman and a date on the spine of each
cassette Suspended from the ceiling a monitor shows a live
picture of TRUMAN sleeping on the sofa

Sitting in front of a playback monitor CHLOE is transfixed by
Truman thirty-four years earlier a FETUS in his mothers womb

CHRISTOF (0C)
What are you looking for

Chloe tries to conceal her startlement at CHRISTOFs unexpected
entrance

CHLOE
(not taking her eyes from screen)
He was premature wasnt he

CHRISTOF
Only by two weeks

CHLOE
Curious even then Like he couldnt
wait to get started

CHRISTOF
(feeling out where the
conversation is headed)
His eagerness to leave his mothers womb
also meant he was the one selected

CHLOE
What was it like the first show
CHRISTOF
The ultimate live television In competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies - the
casting of a show determined by an air date
- he was the one who arrived on cue

CHLOE
Is it true what you saidon the show tonight
About letting him go if he wanted it badly
enough Would you really do that

Christof stares at his assistant weighing her loyalty

CHRISTOF
It wont come to that

INT OFFICE DAY

The suitably crestfallen TRUMAN stands in front of his boss
ERROL sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk LAWRENCE
lounges on the guest sofa enjoying Trumans dressing-down

INT BANK DAY

TRUMAN approaches the bank window The teller is the YOUNG
WOMAN whose child Truman attacked in the street She takes a
step back at the sight of Truman apprehensive the
confrontation fresh in her memory

Truman glances at the names on the checks in the young womans
hand realizing how she was able to identify him in the street
He begins to apologize profusely

INT TRUMANS GARAGE DUSK

TRUMAN enters the garage carrying Sylvias sweater He
breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it
in the trunk With a sense of finality he lowers the lid and
fastens the lock

EXT TRUMANS BACKYARD DUSK

TRUMAN emerges from the garage wheeling his lawnmower
deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house

Staring out of the kitchen window a tall glass of iced tea in
her hand MERYL has been anticipating her husbands appearance
She wears a neckbrace we sense more as a reminder to Truman
than for any benefit she might derive

Feeling Meryls eyes burning into his back Truman fires up the
mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section
of grass We focus on the errant blades of grass as they are
severed by the mower The lawn is now uniformly trimmed

From a mechanical platform above the Expressway CHRISTOF and
CHLOE watch Trumans final act of defiance laid to rest

INT OFFICE BUILDING LOWER MANHATTAN MORNING

In an office building high above Manhattans financial district

Finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building
and a TOURISTS camcorder are positioned

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

excitement in the room

CHRISTOF

Looks just like Trumans mother at that age

VIVIEN an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at
the same time as Truman However she reaches for it after
Truman has already turned his back

CHRISTOF

(incensed)
Damn she missed her mark

(impatiently to Simeon)
Why do we bother with walk-throughs if
nobody pays attention Give me a two-shot
of Truman and Viviengo to the master
-hold the elevators

(mustering patience into microphone)
Vivien press the elevator button again
and make sure you catch his eye this time
INT INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY DAY

A second time TRUMANs brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like
clockwork As instructed she hammers away at the elevator
button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman The elevator
car duly arrives and Trumans eyes follow Viviens rear as she
sachets into the lift For a moment he appears to glance at a
piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

CHRISTOF
Good Perfect Cut to the interior

The monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator rapidly
filling with co-workers

CHRISTOF
and Lawrence

Just as the doors are about to close LAWRENCE oozes in He
gives Truman a smug smile

CHRISTOF
nice look Lawrenceand Vivien

The elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers

LAWRENCE
(admiring aside to the remaining
fellow-males in the elevator)
I wouldnt kick her out of bed

Truman doesnt seem to share Lawrences enthusiasm for the
comely young woman He is miles away

INT STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM DAY

Assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are
several principal characters in Trumans life - MERYL MARLON
ERROL TYRONE RAQUEL VERONICA and the new actress VIVIEN
sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast

CHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table a large
monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at
American Life plays silently behind Christofs head

CHRISTOF
(to the meeting referring to
Meryl by her real name)
Regrettably I have to inform you that
Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract

All eyes turn to Meryl She looks at the floor

CHRISTOF
Im sure we can all respect her reasons

Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co-
star Marlon now out of wardrobe wearing an Armani suit

CHRISTOF

Her separation from Truman will be
orchestrated over the summer

(more up-beat)
However Im pleased to announce that
televisions first on-air conception will
still take place You witnessed the initial
contact this morning

(glancing to Vivien once

again using her real name)
You all know Claudia from her work in theatre
Thankfully Truman doesnt

The rest of the cast nod politely in Viviens direction

CHRISTOF
(referring to the bound documents
CHLOE passes to each cast member)
This is a copy of Claudias back story
Her characters name will be Vivien
Shes the new adjuster at the office

The cast idly flip through the documents prominently stamped on
the cover NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET

CHRISTOF
We intend to entice Truman into the
affair as soon as possible Claudia will
make her advance at the seminar Trumans
attending next week Details are in your
schedules Im sure youll all make Claudia
welcome

MARLON
(injecting a note of levity more
sophisticated than the character he plays)
Question is will Truman make her welcome

The cast snickers

CHRISTOF
(immediately back to business)
I dont have to tell you how critical
the next few weeks will be This takes us
into the next generation When Trumans
child is born the network will be switching
to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives

VIVIEN
What happens when Truman and the baby are
both on camera together

CHRISTOF
There will simply be duplicate coverage

VIVIEN
(mischievous)
Lets just hope we dont have twins

CHLOE
(uncharacteristically flippant)
When Truman dies do we go back to the
single channel

The cast turn in her direction Christof has a second occasion
to question his Assistants loyalty

INT A BAR SOMEWHERE DAY

The BARMAN WAITRESS and PATRON we have seen before observe
TRUMAN on the television above the bar The cameras track
Trumans progress walking along Broadway As he ducks into a
sex shop the threesome at the bar exchange looks Inside the
store Truman appears apprehensive

BARMAN
Whats he doing in there

PATRON
Meryls at her moms Maybe hes got an urge

On screen Truman looks through some X-Rated video titles
WAITRESS
(referring to Trumans overcoat)

Whats with the coat

BARMAN
(smirking at the irony)
Maybe he doesnt wanna be recognized

Truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia knocking an
item to the floor

PATRON
(remarking on Trumans clumsiness)
Nervous

Truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store
the cameras following his journey as always

BARMAN
(exasperated)
Oh God he never bought nothing

WOMAN
Give hima break Its taken him thirty-
four years to get the nerve to go in there

INT TRUMANS HOUSE - KITCHEN NIGHT

We focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator several
pages long The kitchen itself is a bombsite More than the
cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked
haphazardly on the floor

INT TRUMANS HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT

The usually orderly bedroom is also a mess Blankets piled ina
heap Several large half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the
room A chair in an odd position near the bed Clothes strewn
everywhere Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered

TRUMAN is asleep in bed the damaged waterbed replaced with a
standard mattress Although he is completely covered from head
to toe in bedding the outline of his body is still clearly
visible

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

Close up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control

room It displays a wide shot of Trumans darkened bedroom
filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras
Assistant Producer SIMEON and his VIDEO OPERATORS slouch in
their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen

Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic metronomic manner

SIMEON
Ready two Go to two

Operator eating a doughnut presses one of the illuminated
buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close
shot of Trumans covered head The camera stays on the
blanketed head for a long moment

SIMEON
And back to the medium

Another button is pressed and the angle changes A trace of
frustration is evident in the control room Recording a
sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to
contend with Trumans recently aquired camera-shyness

SIMEON
and wide

OPERATOR
(aside to Simeon)
Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried

SIMEON
(shrugs)
That loser pays our salary

OPERATOR
Hes given up on himself again

SIMEON
Who cares Makes life easier for us
He is what he is

At the far end of the great room one of the large double

doors opens and CHRISTOF enters as always accompanied by CHLOE
carrying a leather-bound folder Simeon and the Operators
subtely straighten in their chairs Christof pretends not to
notice He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor

CHRISTOF
When did he start sleeping like that

SIMEON
About the time Meryl left

CHRISTOF
Is that the best shot we can get

SIMEON
Whats to see

Christof watches Truman a trace of concern in his eyes

CHRISTOF
(referring to the debris in Trumans bedroom)
What happened to the room

SIMEON
He started to reorganize I was going to
call you But half-way through he gave
up and fell asleep

Apparently satisfied Christof turns to an operator

CHRISTOF
I want to check the set-ups for tomorrows
insurance convention

Reading off the notes in Chloes folder the operator punches
up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors They
show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel devoid of actors A
banner in reception reads WELCOME AMERICAN LIFE and ACCIDENT
The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his
producers attention has wandered Christof is staring at the
sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor

CHRISTOF
Give me a shot from his wedding band

SIMEON
(pointing out the ring on Trumans
bedside table)
He took it off

CHRISTOF
(a trace of concern)
Why is he so still Hes too still

Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to
his ear

CHRISTOF
Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify

An operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel Christof and
his colleagues listen to Trumans steady breathing in their

headphones Simeon and the Operators nod reassured that
nothing is amiss Christof is not so easily convinced
CHRISTOF

Give me a preview An ECU on his torso
A camera hidden in the rooms bedside lamp zooms in to Trumans
prone outlinewhile the breathing remains steady the body

does not rise and fall

CHRISTOF
(anxious barking a command to Chloe)
Phone him

Chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials

CHRI STOF
(anticipating Chloes question)
Wrong number

The phone on the bedside table inches from Trumans head
begins to ring Truman doesnt flinch

INT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE NIGHT

SYLVIA walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a
late night swim Hearing the telephone ringing she rushes

to pick it up However after lifting the receiver the phone
continues to ring

The sound is coming from her television left on in the bureau
On the screen TRUMAN sleeps seemingly undisturbed by the call
Sylvia drying herself watches with fascination

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT
CHRISTOF and the CREW are now highly agitated

CHRISTOF
(a trace of panic)
He didnt drink tonight No pills

Every question receives a shake of the Assistants head in
reply

CHRISTOF
Hang up

Chloe promptly cuts the connection and Trumans phone
ceases to ring

CHRISTOF
Get Marlon over there

CHLOE
Under what pretext

CHRISTOF
(letting his anxiety show)
Any fucking pretext
Christof turns his back on the monitors his mind racing

EXT TRUMANS HOUSE NIGHT

MARLONs car squeals to a halt outside Trumans house
Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest he
dashes barefoot to the front door He tries the doorhandle
pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously
shouting Trumans name all the while

MARLON
TruTru

Frustrated Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the
window He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but
his shouts fail to rouse him Marlon picks up one of Meryls
carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window

MARLON
(shouting a warning)
Im comin in Tru

Marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower
of glass over Trumans bed Still he doesnt move Marlon
reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the
window frame and unlatches the window

NT TRUMANS HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT

MARLON clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands
in an awkward heap on the floor beside TRUMANs bed

He pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally

stands at his co-stars bedside There is a hissing sound
Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover Beneath the bedding is a
life-size inflatable female doll

The doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly
deflating Lying beside the dolls chest is Trumans portable
tape recorder Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next
to his ear The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

CHRISTOF wide-eyed stares at the image on the On-Air monitor
of MARLON and his bizarre companion Marlon is frozen staring
into camera

CHRISTOF
(quiet but firm)
Cut transmission

Simeon hesitates unsure if has heard correctly He looks to
Christof for confirmation his finger poised over an
EMERGENCY button

CHRISTOF
(enraged)
I said Cut

Christof lunges forward and presses the button himself

INT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE NIGHT

SYLVIA watches agog as the scene in Trumans bedroom on
her television screen is replaced by the TRUMAN logo and the
message TECHNICAL FAULT PLEASE STAND BY

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

CHRISTOF has taken his place at the control panel On the bank
of monitors in front of the mixing desk the OPERATORS
systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Trumans
home and neighborhood Occasionally MARLON or an EXTRA appear
in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt

While the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card
Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor
playing in fast-rewind time code in the bottom right corner
It is a recording of the nights transmission Simeon stops on
the last on-camera appearance by TRUMAN

They watch Truman on-screen switch off his bedroom light and
climb into bed fully clothed immediately pulling the covers
over his head As the light is switched off the recording
camera automatically switches to night vision Simeon continues
to play at normal speed now and then scrolling forward in fast-
forward mode Christof suddenly points to the screen

CHRISTOF
There FreezeZoom into the chair

Simeon types the appropriate command

CHRISTOF
Enhance

On the blown-up screen between a cardboard box and a chair leg
it is barely possible to make out Trumans hand as he crawls
commando-style from his bedroom his inflatable replacement
already positioned in the bed

CHRISTOF
(referring to the debris)
He wasnt making a mess He was engineering
a blind spot
CHLOE

How does he know where the cameras are

CHRI STOF
I dont know
(noting the time-code on the monitor
staring into the back of Simeons head)
All I know is weve been filming a blow-up
doll for the last three hours

Simeon feels the hostility

INT

CONTROL ROOM DAY

The systematic search of the monitors continues They now
reveal that dawn has broken on the set

SIMEON
(hanging up the phone)
Weve declared a curfew Only the extras
required for the search are on the set
Everyone else is at first positions

CHRISTOF
All prop cars accounted for

SIMEON
He has to be on foot He has the worlds
most recognizable face He cant disappear

All heads turn to CHLOE as she enters the grand control room
with a status report

EXT

CHLOE
The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug
if we dont make a statement within the next
hour The media is in a feeding frenzy The phone
lines are jammed Every network has a pirated shot
of Harlon and the dummy

VACANT LOT DAY
TRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site tearing at his
clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud

He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a
shopping cart awaits loaded with soiled plastic bags
Looking every inch a derelict Truman begins to wheel his
shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn

EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE DAY

TRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge
Over his shoulder in the far distance we see a lone car
approaching As it nears we recognize a police car

Truman takes a look under the bridge as if participating in
the search The car slowly draws alongside the POLICE OFFICER
looking straight into Trumans blackened face

POLICE OFFICER
Any sign of him

TRUMAN
(deliberately gravelling his voice)
Not yet

The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman After what
seems like an eternity he motions his PARTNER to drive on

POLICE OFFICER
(to Truman as the car pulls away)
Take it easy

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN DAY

We pan down one concrete canyon after another The usually
bustling financial district is totally eerily deserted

Suddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street
Then another and another

PEOPLE of every description shoulder to shoulder marching

down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted
at a crime scene The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS
linked arm in arm wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES
and SECRETARIES STORE CLERKS TELEPHONISTS MAINTENANCE and
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WAITERS and WAITRESSES COOKS SHOPPERS
HEALTH WORKERS SECURITY GUARDS POSTAL WORKERS POLICE
OFFICERS FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE On one occasion we
glimpse Trumans colleagues LAWRENCE ERROL and VIVIEN amongst
the searchers
A building-to-building floor-to-floor office-to-office search

is also being conducted each structure secured as they go the

searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such
as closets dumpsters man holes sewers car trunks trees and

shrubbery

We focus on one of the waves of searchers TRUMAN has linked
arms in the middle of a row his disguise still holding up

A swarm of helicopters fills the sky

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

While his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens CHRISTOF has
been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives MOSES and
ROMAN

MOSES
(to Christof who is still studying
the faces in a row of SEARCHERS)
Rumors are circulating hes dead

ROMAN

STAND BY graphic now accompanied by
soothing classical music)
Why Were getting higher ratings for
that graphic than any time in the series

INT BARROOM DAY
The television behind the bar carries the still graphic

BAR PATRONS animatedly discuss Trumans fate over their drinks
Some place bets with each other over the outcome

A crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions
in the window of an electronics store awaiting developments
INT LIVING ROOM DAY

The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the

The fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to
make another sweep

CHLOE

When we flush him out how do we explain this

CHRISTOF
(deadpan)
We tell him the truth

Chloe looks askance at Christof

CHRISTOF

Well get him on this next sweep

CHRISTOF
What have we missed

SIMEON
Its just a matter of time

CHRISTOF
No Weve missed something

Christof turns his back on the screens Over his shoulder
we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN - PIER 13 DAY

TRUMAN has broken away from the line of searchers on the
pretext of taking a leak He is standing on the edge of

Pier 13 facing the harbor his back turned to those beginning
their next sweep Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green
and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street
Racquet Club

We see a close up of Trumans terrified eyes in his blackened
face staring down at the lapping water It triggers a montage
of flashbacks As usual the images all appear to play ona
television screen
TRUMAN on the CLIFF FACE at seven years old his second grade
teacher SISTER OLIVIA a close-up of DROWNING STATISTICS at

his insurance company mesmerized by the water in the FERRY

EXT PIER 13 DAY

TRUMAN comes back to reality He steels himself shuts out the
doubts and dives into the water

EXT NEW YORK HARBOR DAY

Underwater we see TRUMAN panicking at the shock of the cold
sea arms and legs flailing Suddenly he stops and sinks for a
moment in the weight of his clothes Then slowly he rises to
the surface and begins to swim

Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus
flagship The Santa Maria

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

CHRISTOF is spooling through significant scenes in the history
of TRUMAN on a preview monitor

He pauses on the scene of SYLVIA and TRUMAN at the fountain
in Flushing Meadow Park in the shows seventeenth season

EXT NEW YOUR HARBOR DAY

TRUMAN is at the wheel of the Santa Maria wind filling her
sails Covering the face of the ships compass is Sylvias
composite picture

His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor As the archaic
vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget the bridge
appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight Truman steers
around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the
horizon

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

CHRISTOF and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on
a preview monitor skimming over the calm featureless sea
Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched

against the horizon

SIMEON
Thats him

CHRISTOF
Resume transmission

Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is
instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor

INT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE DAY

SYLVIA dozing on the sofa suddenly blinks open her eyes as the
classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the
sound of a helicoptes rotor blade

Sylvia focuses on the screen her breath taken away by the sight
of TRUMAN at the wheel of the Santa Maria

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

CHRISTOF
(staring intently at the On-Air monitor)
What do we have on that boat

Simeon scans a computer shot list He types in a code A
camera from the main mast of Trumans ship activates Truman
unaware of the camera is concentrating on steering the vessel

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN DAY

TRUMAN is out of sight of land the sea choppier now rising

and falling beneath his boat He nears a large buoy bobbing
clumsily in the strong swell An official-looking sign is
attached - DANGER NAVAL EXERCISES DO NOT ENTER We see an
extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised
miniature camera tracks Trumans progress

INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

CHRISTOF and the other PRODUCTION STAFF watch TRUMAN from the
buoys POV as he sails by

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN DAY

TRUMAN hears a helicopter overhead By now the ocean spray has
washed most of the dirt from his face only a residue remains
The rags he wears including Sylvias sweater under his open
coat are soaked Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass

As he steers he occasionally refers to a HOW TO SAIL book
from his coat pocket He tacks against the wind as he watches
the military chopper circle his boat

CHOPPER PILOT
(over PA)
Alter course immediately You are
entering a restricted area

Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper

CHRISTOF
(into microphone to pilot eerily composed)
Fire a warning

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN DAY

A round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows
of Trumans boat several rounds striking the deck TRUMAN
flinches In his eyes we see the ghosts return With great
effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare
gun from the storage cabinet in the boats wheel house

CHOPPER PILOT (over PA)
Alter course Drop your sails

Truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun The
distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter narrowly
missing Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads

(shocked at the near miss)
Jesus God Is he out of his mind

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN DAY

Before the chopper can take evasive action TRUMAN takes aim a
second time and fires The distress flare fishtails into the
sky and to Trumans surprise and delight finds its mark
striking the rear rotor blade Truman lets out a whoop

The helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards
the sea The CHOPPER PILOTS bail out of the cockpit splashing
down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves
in a spectacular belly flop sinking out of view in seconds like
a stone Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in
their inflatable life jackets thoughts of duty invade Trumans
head He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back steering
away from the drifting pilots A look of resolve in his eyes we
have never witnessed before

INT SYLVIAS BEACH HOUSE DAY

SYLVIA kneels on the floor in front of the television As

still covering the ships compass - she allows herself a brief
moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much

Simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk
marked WAVE WIND and RAIN After typing in a command he
winds the controls towards their maximum settings

Chloe searches Christofs face trying to find the man in whom
she has believed for so long

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN DAY

Darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards Trumans
boat at an alarming speed High winds buffet the boat TRUMAN
fights the wheel Hurricane force winds shake the masts and
keel ripping the sails to shreds

The picture of Sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the
sea His HOW TO SAIL book skids off the deck

Truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes
himself to the wheel to secure himself on board

TRUMAN
(shouting above the storm)
Im coming to find you Sylvia Im making
myself deaf

Youre going to have to kill me Come on

Monstrous waves continually submerge the deck Truman continues
to head into the teeth of the gale

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN DAY

TRUMAN appears to be losing his fight against the storm

each successive breaker taking its toll on his body sapping
his strength his bindings the only thing holding him upright
his head slumps the wheel goes loose in his grasp spinning
out of control His will draining away

As he is about to be overcome by the next wave he thrusts his
arm into the handles of the spinning wheel He cries out in
pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the
wheel He braces for one last wave

But the wave does not come A strange phenomenon is occurring
in the ocean A distinct division has appeared in the ocean
swell Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of
calmer water several hundred yards wide a curious escape lane

The wind and the rain are also subsiding the darkness lifting
Truman steers his vessel down this sea-lane

After some time several large dark shapes emerge on the
horizon Land Islands As Truman steers towards the nearest
shape he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations
t is certainly not the moon

The dark shape is a huge iron roller only half of which is
exposed above the surface of the sea The ocean swell is being
caused by the roller slowly turning mechanically-driven on
either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed

n fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in
both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see
the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers
Trumans boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines The exposed
half of each roller the height of a ten story building its
length equivalent to several football fields The massive arms
perpetually churn

fq

Trumans face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly
past the giant rotating drum The water beyond the rollers is
dead calm Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his
eyes

But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to
comprehend it pales in comparison with the next sight that
greets him His boat is drifting inexorably on a slow
collision course with the sky That infinitely receding horizon
line recedes no more
The sea really does meet the sky The join is only too
apparent Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of
colossal dimensions The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop
Truman looks upward straining his eyes to see the top of the
sky but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight

The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky bumping
gently into its latex surface Truman unties his bindings

and stumbles across the deck to the side rail Clinging to the
rail with one hand he tentatively reaches out towards the
painted cyclorama He touches the sky

He feels the surface puts both terrified hands against it

Hie eyes well up with tears He presses his distraught face
into it He screams at the top of his voice No words A

primal scream A pained animal howl

INT CONTROL ROOM DUSK

CHRISTOF and his PRODUCTION STAFF take in Trumans reaction
in silence

streets - wherever a television is to be found No VIEWER
speaks They are stunned to silence many teary eyed

EXT CYCLORAMA DUSK

As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve

of the cyclorama TRUMANs attention is drawn to an outline in
the otherwise flawless backdrop He clambers to the prow of the
boat

There camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water
line is a door Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle
and halts the drifting boat He stands in front of the door and
closes his eyes in a silent prayer

He opens the door in the sky and steps through

Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their
various locations - bars homes and offices Strangers hug each

first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop forgetting
himself for a moment caught up in the drama

Self-conscious he takes his seat again almost immediately His
COLLEAGUES are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing
to play its only available shot the open door in the sky -
Truman out of view

INT SOUNDSTAGE DUSK

TRUMAN finds himself on a small metal landing A steel ladder
rises above him to the height of sky the soundstage roof so
high as to be barely visible The rungs also continue downward
the depth of the ocean-bed to a studio floor far below

Truman turns and looks back through the door he has just
entered Unsecured the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away
The sea he has feared since childhood is nothing but an
enormous tank The sky a massive cyclorama New York City an
elaborate set And it is all housed within an impossibly large
soundstage

Truman makes no effort to save the boat He shuts the door to
his world A sign on the back of the door reads CLOSED SET
No Unauthorized Access Gradually he becomes aware of another
strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage All around
him thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to
masquerade as stars are slowly illuminating - switched on by an
automatic timer (The light fixtures match the one that almost
struck Trumans car at the beginning of the film)

By artificial starlight Truman begins his long descent of the
step ladder Below a studio tram makes its way along the
soundstage perimeter on the last tour of the day

INT STUDIO TRAM DUSK

As he drives a well-scrubbed young TOUR GUIDE delivers his
tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to

the half-full tram of STUDIO VISITORS

GUIDE
the soundstage roof houses over eight
hundred thousand lights of varying intensities
to faithfully recreate the constellations

However the passengers are paying less attention than usual
They stare perplexed at the television monitor above the
Guides head continuing to play the shows only available shot
of the open door in the sky

INT SOUNDSTAGE DUSK

TRUMAN suddenly steps in front of the tram The TOUR GUIDE
stands on the brakes tram lurching to a stop The Guide looks
from Trumans haunted face to the monitor hardly able to
believe his eyes

Truman leaps on board pressing his flare gun into the side of
the guides head

TRUMAN
(to the shocked passengers)
Nobody move
(to the guide)
Drive

The terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram resuming the
tour

TRUMAN
(to the guide gesturing to the microphone)
Keep talking Say whatever you say

The Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone

GUIDE
Erthe ocean tank contains over six hundred
and fifty million gallons of man-made salt
water temperature-controlled

Trumans attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram -
TRUMAN STUDIO TOUR He is suddenly aware of the tourists
gawking at him

TRUMAN
(to TOURIST camcorder around his neck)
Act normal Keep filming

Truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of STUDIO SECURITY CARS
speeds towards the tram But they streak past on their way to
the site of Trumans escape As he tentatively gets back to his
feet Truman finds a CHILD standing in front of him with an
autograph book

CHILD
Please Mister Truman

On the childs T-shirt a large photograph of Trumans face

INT CONTROL ROOM DUSK

CHRISTOF talks anxiously on the phone unaware of a shift in the
balance of power taking place behind his back The executives
MOSES and ROMAN are huddling with SIMEON making him an offer he
appears to welcome

CHRISTOF
(into the phone)
What do you mean hes not there We cant
have lost him again

On the far side of the control room behind a huge curved
glass wall on a mezzanine floor a studio tour tram passes by

INT STUDIO TRAM DUSK

TRUMAN crouches behind a seat on the tram flare gun still
trained on the guides head taking in the gigantic video wall
displaying pictures from every facet of his life

His heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private
spot where he and SYLVIA met

GUIDE
»on your left the control room where the
angles are selected and the actors receive
direction Of course the one place we cant
show you is the story department There is none
(hesitant)
Truman writes the script

From Trumans POV we watch CHLOE approach CHRISTOF She has a
pure white envelope in her hands As Christof looks up to
acknowledge her he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the
tram

INT STUDIO LOT DUSK

Still inside the studio complex the tram enters the courtyard
of an indoor shopping mall Truman gift shops
TRUMAN is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays
full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles
such as TrumanTrivia Video cassettes offering Truman
Highlights His face emblazoned on T-shirts caps coffee mugs
and posters Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying
Oldsmobile are offered for sale

The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tours end
STUDIO POLICE are checking the disembarking PASSENGERS Truman
using the TOUR GUIDE as a shield also exits the tram

GUIDE
(frightened for his life)
Here he is Its him

Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and
makes a run for it The guards give chase Truman runs into a
lookalike mannequin dressed in a brown suit identical to his
own promoting TrumanWear He pulls his double to the
ground to block the guards path

Sprinting along a featureless corridor he reaches a dead end

GUARD
(into radio)
Weve got him trapped

Truman enters a doorway marked NO ENTRY to find a stairway
leading upwards He takes the stairs three at a time

The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind Flight

after flight of stairs At one point he loses his grip on the
stairs railing and his gun falls from his hand clattering for
an eternity down the stairwell

He finally emerges on a landing Lungs bursting One more
door He tries the handle It opens

EXT SOUNDSTAGE DUSK

TRUMAN finds himself on the roof of the soundstage Outside
Really outside for the first time in his life

He looks frantically around him Nowhere to hide The
soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the
eye can see an interminable expanse of roof

Facing him a colossal Burbank Several other soundstages
almost as gigantic as his own The palm trees lining the
streets dwarfed by the mammoth barns
The Hollywood Freeway in the distance carrying its ribbons of
traffic twenty lanes wide Gargantuan office buildings
eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known

Directly below him a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its
arched entranceway

Above him a large yellow moon in the twilight sky The real
moon not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating
for the last thirty-four years

Truman wheels around suddenly realizing he is not alone A
GROUP has emerged on the rooftop standing still and silent
in a semi-circle cutting off any escape

Along with the STUDIO GUARDS keeping their distance in the
background are CHLOE SIMEON and the two studio executives
MOSES and ROMAN In front of them the co-stars in his life -
MARLON MERYL sister RAQUEL mother AUDREY and supposedly dead
father KIRK No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the
familiar faces Marlon in particular cannot look him in the
eye

Trumans gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing
at the head of the group CHRISTOF He approaches Truman
alone carrying a white envelope calling his name the way a
father calls to a son

CHRISTOF
Truman

Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his
life drawn to and repelled by him at the same time As they
stand together looking into each others eyes for the first
time they seem to be the only two figures on the roof For a
moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky

TRUMAN
(quietly half to himself
half to Christof)
Even the stars I wished on

As Truman turns his attention back to Christof he suddenly
lunges at him catching him off-guard the envelope slipping
from Christofs hand With a strength he never knew he
possessed Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage
roof threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world

Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself The
studio guards dare not move

CHRISTOF
(staring into the chasm

remaining eerily calm)
You wont do it Truman Ive watched you
your whole life

TRUMAN
(meeting Christofs gaze)
You never had a camera in my head

Suddenly the doubts flood into Christofs eyes fearing he
has misjudged Truman fearing for his life

TRUMAN
(incensed)
Something was real
(a terrifying anguish)
Something had to be real

It takes all of Trumans will not to hurl the old man into the
abyss Christof petrified looks to the pristine white

envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof glinting in
the moonlight

Truman follows Christofs gaze Contemptuously tossing Christof
aside he retrieves the envelope Christof crawls to safety
thankful to still be alive suddenly appearing very small and
insignificant

But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer
exist in Trumans mind Truman gazes at his name for a long
moment handwritten on the envelope in blue ink then carefully
breaks the seal Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to
be slowly revealed A photograph A close up of SYLVIAs face
including her eyes mouth and that perfect ever-elusive nose

A serenity comes over Truman He lifts up his eyes to the
mountains on the far horizon As he stands on the very edge of
the soundstage roof without fear clutching the photograph we
commence a long slow pull-back

Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall

of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic
picture of his face and proclaiming TRUMAN - Total Record of a
Human Life 34TH GREAT YEAR

We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on
top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame

A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS

The two OLD WOMEN in the living room the NIGHTWATCHMEN the
two YOUNG MEN with the Watchman TV the PATRONS in the bar
PASSERS-BY outside an electronics store are all captivated by
their television sets

We focus on the screen of a television A small FEMALE BABY
sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Trumans old
suburban home in Queens the lawn he mowed for ten years of his
life The infants doting parents MARLON and the new actress
VIVIEN enter frame and begin to fuss over the child A border
around the action on the screen announces ZOE - Total

Record Of a Human Life

Suddenly we see a childs hand on top of the television screen
A BABY stands unsteadily supporting herself against the
television set in Sylvias house

TRUMAN bends down and picks up his baby tossing her into the
air much to the childs delight Truman dwells for a moment
on the mirror-image scene on the television before very
deliberately shutting it off

SYLVIA joins Truman and their daughter Together they exit
the beach house We follow them as they make their way onto the
deserted sand and down towards the sea

FADE OUT
