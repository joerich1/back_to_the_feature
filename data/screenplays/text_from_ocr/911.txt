REVELATION 911

AND (THE LOCUSTS) HAD A KING OVER THEM WHICH IS THE ANGEL
OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT WHOSE NAME IN THE HEBREW TONGUE IS
ABADDON

The VERSE FADES slowly into the black as we HEAR
A DIAL TONE THREE DIGITS are entered

OPERATOR FEMALEVO
Nine one one What’s your
emergency

The caller’s WHISPERING reply is broken up by the quick
breath of PANIC

CALLER FEMALEVO
I’ve got intruders people are
breaking in

CUT OFF by voices of ANOTHER 911 CALL

CUT OFF By ANOTHER call and another and MORE

The calls come faster Frantic voices overlapping building
in frequency Dozens Hundreds

THOUSANDS All calling the police because the police are
attacking A rising roaring convolution of panic and CHAOS

The tumult is SILENCED abruptly as it stretches toward some
uproarious infinity - silenced BUT FOR a SINGLE caller’s
VOICE her PANIC and TERROR caught in mid sentence

CALLER FEMALEVO
-are just shooting just shooting
everyone dead Why These are
innocent people

The voice that responds now is NOT HUMAN with a deep
DEMONIC tone - The impossibly deep pitch of something PURELY
EVIL with a HISS of radio STATIC stuck in its throat

DEMONIC VOICEVO
The situation is under control We
are sending units to assist
CALLER
(hyperventilating) Merciful
Christ assist in what Who

FADE IN TO

EXT 3 WAY INTERSECTION DAY

A POLICE cruiser RACES up a one-lane side street toward an
INTERSECTION its lights and sirens off

It runs a RED LIGHT narrowly missing two vehicles in the
perpendicular traffic

The driver leans on the brakes and SWERVES

TIRES SQUEAL and the cruiser SPINS OUT The back end
fishtails into a JOGGER who has stopped to TIE his SHOE
CATAPULTING him through the front window of a DINER

FREEZE on the JOGGER his twisted body in mid-crash through
the window swimming in sea of flying GLASS shards and BLOOD

TYLERVO
There is a place we call Hell It
is a dimension of chaos or as we
humans like to call it evil But
evil is not what you think Evil is
only what it wants you to think
And to keep life as you know it
intact evil is also necessary The
fuel it burns to keep running are
souls Hell reaps its souls through
temptation by manipulation
letting humanity condemn itself
Kind of passive aggressive really
Any impressions you might have
gotten about Hell from bad Movies
or shooter games are bullshit Hell
prefers to be misunderstood

INT CROWDED DINER DAY

The diner’s front window EXPLODES in a Jagged hail of glass
as the JOGGER PLUNGES into the dining section and skids
across a table seating six diners replacing plates and
silverware with a BLOODY STREAK before TUMBLING to the FLOOR
out of view

( )

CHAOS erupts An uproar consumes the diner as patrons and
employees recoil from the lifeless BLOODY HEAP on the floor
The police cruiser’s SIREN WOOPS briefly from outside and
RED and BLUE LIGHTS STROBE through the diner’s interior The
siren ceases but the lights remain

Through the window the diner’s occupants watch as TWO
UNIFORMED COPS step out of the cruiser They’re both big
stocky their faces frozen in a slight SCOWL as if
something about them is not human

One of them enters the diner through the FRONT DOORS while
the other approaches the JAGGED GAP in the broken front
window

The panic and screaming abates to near silence making
clearer the sound of a SIREN in the DISTANCE but FADING in
pursuit of some other emergency

CoP2 walks slowly thru the diner until he stands over the
broken body of the jogger The only sounds now are the
CRUNCHING of BROKEN GLASS under the officer’s boots as he
walks and the SOBBING of a single WAITRESS who can’t seem
to get a hold of herself

The cop looks down at the dead jogger with a total absence
of concern Then over at the hysterical waitress with a
trace of irritation

Cop2 draws his SIDE-ARM and SHOOTS HER right between the
eyes He speaks and his voice is DEMONIC but with the white
noise HISS of STATIC

COP 2
Cease and desist

Several patrons behind the waitress are sprayed with BLOOD
from her exit wound

customers SCREAM and start RUNNING for the door COP 2 AIMS
his gun at the emigrating crowd and UNLOADS on them When
his CLIP emtpies and DROPS out of the magazine to the FLOOR
he reloads with a fresh clip and UNLOADS again

EXT OUTSIDE OF DINER DAY

COP 1 is at the shattered window with a police issue
12-GAUGE A few of the diner’s occupants make it through the
front doors to the sidewalk only to be DISPATCHED by
COP2s 12 GAUGE and its loud THUNDERING REPORTS as empty
shells LAUNCH from the side of the weapon

( )

FREEZE on the SHOTGUN in MID-BLAST ejected shells ARCHING
away to the side the CUSTOMER hit by the shot his CHEST
EXPLODING in a PLUME of smoke buckshot and blood he’s
blown off his feet HOVERING over a sprawl of BODIES on the
sidewalk behind him

TYLERVO
Ages ago they exiled one of their
own A creature we would call a
demon was banished from a realm
that no longer had a place for it
because in its advancing age it had
become too chaotic - too
destructive So it was consigned to
the material universe where Hell
knew that without a living soul to
possess it couldn’t exist as
matter only on a subatomic level
as energy and that energy took the
form of radio waves - photons And
this frequency became quite simply
haunted Home to a brutal
destructive energy too evil for a
place called Hell And it
hibernated there in this Bottomless
Pit waiting for someone to tap
into this channel This afternoon
at 225 PM its patience was richly
rewarded

INT MASSACRED DINER DAY

Both cops continue SHOOTING UP the diner until everyone is
dead or dying except for ONE short balding MAN in his
forties wearing a business suit He is on his KNEES
holding his BRIEFCASE up over his head with trembling hands
that RATTLE the contents

COP 2 approaches the man and nudges aside the briefcase
with the barrel of his gun There is a glimmer of
RECOGNITION in his eyes

COP 2
Douglas M Ranier

MAN ON KNEES
yry--yes wh what-

COP2

Assistant state’s Attorney for Paradise County

RANIER
WWWhy are you talking like that

Cop 1’s scowl pulls pulls back to a DEMONIC GRIN and he
emits a slow demonic LAUGH

COP 1
Well if this don’t make Rodney King
look like a church picnic on your
feet

Cop 2 GRABS Ranier by his arm and GROPES through Ranier’s
pockets until he finds a WALLET pulls it out and OPENS it
Holding Ranier with one hand and looking at the ID with the
other

He turns to look at the trembling RANIER again carelessly
TOSSING the wallet the other direction

COP 2
Abaddon is law

Cop 2 YANKS Ranier toward the door Ranier STUMBLES after
him almost tripping over the dead and dying sprawled across
the floor He clutches his briefcase with his free hand but
it COLLIDES with the edge of a TABLE now and pops open
SPILLING its contents

Several more OS GUNSHOTS closer this time with SCREAMS

RANIER
Oh Christ on a stick Why did you
shoot that girl Are you going to
shoot me

Cop 2 HALTS He turns to Ranier pokerfaced looking first
at him THEN at the open briefcase he is clutching This
starts Ranier TREMBLING again shaking the last few pens
paper-clips and other contents onto the FLOOR COP1 speaks
again in the demonic voice

COP 2
Hey cream-stick You’re under
arrest now So I think maybe it’s
time you exercise Your
constitutional right to shut the
fuck up

The hiss of radio STATIC on cop 2’s shoulder mic is

followed by the sound of an 0OS demonic voice identical to
that of both cops

( )

DEMON VOICE IN CBOS
Eleven twenty nine status

COP 2
Twenty nine here Westside gas-n-go
and over-easy diner depopulated
One priority target in custody
Douglas Ranier alive

Tires SQUEAL and Vehicles COLLIDE outside the diner
followed by an EXPLOSION and muffled SCREAMING Ranier
REACTS to the disturbing noise 29 YANKS Ranier through
the diner’s (now shattered) front DOORS

EXT CITY STREET DAY

29 and Ranier are immersed in a world of CHAOS and MURDER
now Sounds of SCREAMING and GUNSHOTS come from near and
from far

MONTAGE SCENES OF MAYHEM

A) In the middle of the INTERSECTION in front of the diner
is the fiery aftermath of the (just heard) head on
COLLISION

B) Up the street a MAN is SHOT DEAD slumped half out of
his CAR The DOOR is open and he is hanging by his
seat-belt He has a bloody HOLE between his OPEN eyes

C) A storefront window SHATTERS in a jangling chorus of
BROKEN GLASS as a fat MAN in flannel PLUNGES through it
landing on his back on the sidewalk A large muscular
uniformed COP steps through the jagged remnants of the
window with a police issue 12-gauge while standing over the
man blows his HEAD OFF A wake of BLOOD AND GORE is sprayed
across the sidewalk and up the side of a parked car

D) Three PEOPLE RUN out of a thrift STORE in a PANIC and

blindly into the street where a speeding PADDY-WAGON HITS

one of them CATAPULTING him into the air and onto the ROOF
of a parked CAR Another POLICEMAN exits the thrift store

levels his HANDGUN at the TWO SURVIVORS and CUTS them both
DOWN with multiple SHOTS

E) An EXPLOSION from inside another store Tongues of FLAME
and black SMOKE pour out of what’s left of the store front
An unrecognizable HUMAN FORM staggers outside engulfed in
FLAMES only to be reduced to a lifeless burning HEAP on
the sidewalk by GUNSHOTS from all directions

Powell turns walks back to Ranier as a mysterious CURRENT
OF ELECTRICITY in the background LEAPS from the top of a
STORE-front to a telephone POLE and then to the ground
The meandering current comes with a SCREAMING CRACKLING
noise

POWELL

RANIER

TYLERVO (contd)

fact that by now Mister Shit and
Mister Fan had been formally
introduced in this town Ina
closed session of the Paradise City
Council today a law was passed
And unbeknownst to the citizens of
Paradise Falls the police switched
to a new communications frequency
And this long dormant abomination
awoke to find itself with not one
body to possess but a hundred and
fifty two - bodies with body armor
- and enough weapons and ammunition
to massacre the population of
Paradise Falls and tomorrow the
world This is the story of the
first battle of the apocalypse And
just like the bible said we knew
not what hour it came upon us

-HE CRIED IN MINE EARS WITH A LOUD VOICE SAYING CAUSE THEM
THAT HAVE CHARGE OVER THE CITY TO DRAW NEAR EVEN EVERY MAN
WITH HIS DESTROYING WEAPON IN HIS HAND

a LOT full of vehicles with a tattered vacant BILLBOARD in
the background

Angle on the billboard Most of the last advertisement has
been WORN away by the elements but what little is left
reveals a large red number ONE The superimposed bible verse
slowly fades in until the words ‘EZEKIEL 91 are just to
the left of the (equally sized) number one on the tattered
billboard forming the number 911 and the verse beneath it

Another strange CURRENT of electricity fans out from the
billboard into an iridescent cobweb striking a chain-link
fence behind the billboard in numerous places

INT SHOPPING MALL DAY

A teenage CASHIER wearing a paper HAT behind the counter of
a FAST FOOD place in the food court is BLOWN off his feet by
an OS shotgun BLAST and onto a row of deep fat FRYERS
along the back wall An ARM and a LEG sink into two of the

fry-vats BUBBLING and SPITTING oil beneath a WALL now
dripping with BLOOD

INT SHOPPING MALL DAY

A COP appears at the entrance to a clothing BOUTIQUE
brandishing a naked MANNEQUIN with its arms missing He
SWINGS it at a man RUNNING past the store The mannequin
SHATTERS over the man’s head and shoulders KNOCKING him
flat on his back dazed The COP is still brandishing a
jagged CHUNK of the mannequin’s LEG as he LAUGHS DEMONICALLY

As Several other fleeing SHOPPERS in the background are cut
down by OS GUNFIRE he BLUDGEONS the fallen man furiously
with the broken leg piece before drawing his SIDEARM and
finishing him off with a single GUNSHOT

INT SHOPPING MALL DAY

SEVERAL COPS are BEATING a MAN mercilessly with Billy-clubs
On one of the mall’s upper levels Each blow KNOCKS him
closer to the railing The bloodied man is doubled halfway
over the guard-rail when the cops GRAB him by the legs and
FLING him over

He TUMBLES end over end three stories to the ground floor
where he PLUNGES thru the awning of a vendor’s CONCESSION
STAND full of ornaments and knickknacks as a current of
FLEEING PATRONS surges past

INT SHOPPING MALL DAY

BODIES are floating face down in a blood clouded coin
FOUNTAIN

Two OS GUNSHOTS from somewhere ABOVE and a second later
another BODY HITS the water and joins the others FLOATING in
the fountain with a huge SPLASH of bloody water

EXT MALL PARKING LOT DAY

Three SURVIVORS -two men and a woman have ESCAPED the mall
through a department store exit and into an ocean of
daylight to behold a scene of BLOODSHED and MURDER

In the parking lot SQUAD CARS and other emergency VEHICLES

vehicles throughout the lot Sounds of GUNSHOTS SQUEALING
tires and twisted metal come from every direction

The WOMAN (Judge Catherine Weinling) is the first to speak
She is middle aged heavy-set well dressed

CATHERINE
Where are we parked Where are we

One of the two MEN STEVEN after SCANNING the parking lot

STEVEN

The three TAKE OFF down the sidewalk and through a GROVE of
pine TREES along one of the edge of the lot The WOMAN is
the slowest and LAGS behind MAN 1 is the first to reach
the SUV and is pointing a keyless entry transmitter at it
He hits the ‘’UNLOCK’ button repeatedly but there’s no sound
of a response from the vehicle (why)

STEVEN
What the-

Distant GUNSHOTS And another near miss with a flying BULLET
comes with the sound of breaking GLASS

Steven FUMBLES through his set of KEYS for the right one as
the other two reach the other side of the vehicle Another
BULLET completely SHATTERS the vehicle’s rear WINDOW The
driver finds the right KEY UNLOCKS the driver’s side DOOR
and SCRAMBLES inside reaching across the front seat to
UNLOCK the other door

The OTHER TWO are waiting to get inside when another BULLET
gets Judge Catherine in the side of the neck She HACKS and
COUGHS and starts to DROOL a steady stream of BLOOD Her
EYES seem BLANK catatonic as she STUMBLES back against a
neighboring car and SLUMPS to the ground

STEVEN

Steve CRANKS the wheel back shifts into ‘drive’ and FLOORS
it thru his former parking space getting NICKED by the
Kamikaze cruiser as it passes

The SUV ROARS down a grassy embankment and onto the mall’s
outer ROAD The vehicle LURCHES into the road and takes off
toward the exit to the main HIGHWAY with a portion of the
chain link FENCE SNAGGED somewhere between its undercarriage
and the road leaving a trail of SPARKS in its wake

A POLICE CRUISER HITS them head on both vehicles EXPLODE in
a torrent of twisted METAL and shattered GLASS

EXT SCENE OF COLLISON DAY CONTINUOUS

Both VEHICLES are MASHED STEAM BILLOWS from mangled
radiators and twisted particles of wreckage litter the road
Through the gutted windshield frame of the squad car the
DRIVER of the TOTALED CRUISER becomes visible amidst clouds
of STEAM and DUST as he GRAPPLES with a deflating AIR BAG

It’s another uniformed officer He’s pretty BANGED UP but
alive His face seems to reveal little if any pain The
officer opens his door Unhinged it FALLS to the road with
a CLANG He gets out

Standing now the full extent of his injuries is visible
including severe BLEEDING and A horribly BROKEN ARMbent
halfway back over the elbow The cop emotionless looks at
his mangled arm He grabs the forearm and WRENCHES the bone
back into place with a sickening CRUNCH He walks over
plastic metal and glass debris it CRUNCHES AND SNAPS
under his boots

He gets to the mangled SUV He draws his GUN as he peers thru
one of the shattered windows The driver Steve is covered
in blood but ALIVE DISORIENTED confused

STEVE

has become

Kansas it’s illegal to operate a
motor vehicle while you’re dead

The cop BLOWS Tom’s HEAD OFF An exit wound of BLOOD and
GLASS erupts from the opposite window The cop peers in
again LOOOKING at the OTHER TWO occupants There is a
glimmer of RECOGNITION in his eyes as he focuses on the body
of Catherine he calls it in on his CB shoulder mic

issue TWELVE GAUGE and takes it back to the SUV He puts the
barrel of the shotgun against Cathreine’s neck while
holding her by the hair and PULLS the TRIGGER

The BLAST almost decapitates her and paints the vehicle’s
interior with a monsoon of BLOOD 106 reaches inside with
his good arm TWISTING and TEARING the head free 106 holds
the disembodied HEAD aloft as the last of the BLOOD drains
out of it

From this POV her head blots out the SUN giving the
appearance of a halo

EXT DOWNTOWN DAY

It is late AFTERNOON as POLICE VEHICLES are pulling up to a
large coin FOUNTAIN in front of the Paradise county COURT
HOUSE and COPS are dropping off some GREUSOME CARGO

DEAD BODIES and BODY PARTS They’re all being tossed onto a
mounting pile of flesh at the center of the fountain The
WATER surrounding it now has become BRIGHT RED

The same BLOODY WATER RAINS down from a spout mechanism at
the center and CASCADES down onto the DEAD The last thing
tossed on to the heap is the savagely torn HEAD of JUDGE
CATHERINE Weinley And in the background WRITTEN in BLOOD
on the front of the courthouse are the WORDS

ABADDON IS LAW

TYLERVO
Paradise Falls was only the
beginning - only kindling for a
larger reign of destruction Sooner
or later the massacre of our town
was bound to get the world’s
attention and the world would send
state police FBI National Guard
all with weapons and vehicles all
communicating on their own
frequencies and on those
frequencies this thing would
hitchhike right into their souls a
demon so old and so adept it was
capable of possessing millions
simultaneously

INT CHURCH BASEMENT

This is where Tyler keeps his CACHE of WEAPONS and
EXPLOSIVES A scant few feet down from the CHAPEL where the
reverend performs his weddings funerals and church
services And they’re all DISPLAYED OPENLY down here as if
for sale at a gun show

A rack of RIFLES and MACHINE GUNS on the two longest walls
PISTOLS and EXPLOSIVES are laid out across a long low TABLE
in the center of the room

There is a RACK of CLOSE CIRCUIT camera MONITORS on a DESK
off to the side and at the far wall is a BOOK-CASE
curiously devoid of books

TYLER is here conducting an ARMS DEAL With TWO CUSTOMERS
dressed like gang members He’s in his early forties tall
lean handsome with a touch of gray muscular in a ropey
farm boy sort of way Tyler SITS an old by the table while
the customers are PERUSING the merchandise

range superiority you’1ll need to
stop a hit like that before it even

afflicted or is it a murcury in
the drinking water kind of thing

Customer 2’s scowl pulls into a slight evil GRIN Low
guttural LAUGHTER quiet at first emanates from him in
mounting intensity until he is BELLOWING deep evil
laughter

Then swiftly he GRABS a RIFLE off the wall GRABS an ammo
CLIP off the table and begins to LOCK and LOAD Tyler pulls
up one of his 50 cal desert Eagles out of the holster lying
on the table and levels it at the guy

TYLER
Hey special Olympics You’re about

The man CONTINUES locking and loading and is halfway
through the task of AIMING to fire at Tyler when Tyler
DISPATCHES him with a SINGLE VERY LOUD SHOT to the heart
The guy is BLOWN off his feet

The kid SCREAMS Tyler sees the girl slipping from the man’s
grasp DROPS his gun RUNS to the body of the MAN as he
COLLAPSES and DROPS the kid

Tyler DUCKS and SLIDES under the guy CATCHING the child as

He GETS to his FEET with the CHILD in his arms and looks
down at the TWO dead BODIES now on the floor just as the
REVEREND RUSHES in with a still smoking 38 REVOLVER Like
Tyler He’s holding his gun like a professional

The KID is steadily CRYING now

REVEREND

can assess the situation

She LOOKS around sees the GUNS and the two DEAD customers

MOM
Down here where it’s safe With
the guns and the dead people You
two can go to hell Come on baby

She LEAVES taking the kid with her

REVEREND
Alright let’s have a look at the
cameras

The Reverend looks at the closed circuit MONITORS images of
the church property from different angles We can see dead
BODIES SPRAWLED on the ground MOVEMENT on others a closer
look reveals that they are POLICE and POLICE VEHICLES

more GUNSHOTS
Tyler removes a DRAGONOV SNIPER RIFLE and an AK 47 from the

RACK on the wall he takes the Dragonov into his arms and
hands the AK to the REVEREND as he JOINS him at the cameras

TYLER
Cops A lot of cops Who are they
after

REVEREND

Whole damn neighborhood from the
looks of it

TYLER
If they were raiding us they’d have
taken out our cameras by now

REVEREND
Watch camera three You see those
houses on Perry street in the

background
TYLER

( )
23

REVEREND
Watch closely

ANGLE on security CAMERA THREE a NEIGHBORHOOD of single
family HOMES in the background beyond the church property
Several POLICE RUN thru a back yard CHASING someone who
seems to STUMBLE and FALL

At that same moment a COFFEE TABLE CRASHES thru a WINDOW of
the house behind them

TYLER
Merry freakin’ Christmas I think
it’s time to bounce

Tyler has seen enough He opens a folding door revealing a
CLOSET in the wall behind him and a rack of BODY ARMOR He
puts on one Kevlar VEST and tosses ANOTHER vest to the
reverend who promptly puts it on

More GUNSHOTS from OUTSIDE and a distant EXPLOSION Tyler
pulls a duffle bag from underneath the table He begins
stuffing it with explosives and ammunition from the table

REVEREND
This is your fault you know

TYLER
My fault

REVEREND
This must be a raid on you and
your guns

TYLER
A raid So I guess they’re going
shock and-awe with it by busting up
the whole neighborhood first
right

REVEREND
(frustratedconfused) I don’t know
I don’t know (beat) Look take
this

The Reverend unhooks a large silver CRUCIFIX from a chain
around his neck and hooks it around Tyler’s neck

TYLER
What’s this for

( )
24

REVEREND
Protection Something evil is
afoot

TYLER

Whatever let’s move

REVEREND
It’s very old it used to belong to
to st Sabas

TYLER
Fine I promise let’s move

The Reverend reaches past a stack of books on the BOOKSHELF
against the far wall BOOKS rain to the floor as he feels
around for something He FLIPS an unseen switch and the
bookshelf CREAKS open revealing a hidden PASSAGEWAY The
REVEREND opens it letting Tyler in with his duffel bag full
of goodies TYLER wears a GAS MASK around his neck now and
hands another one to the Reverend

TYLER
You put this on

The Reverend hangs the mask around his neck Tyler DISAPPEARS
into the DARK The Reverend FOLLOWS him and the bookcase
clicks SHUT behind them They come to a small STEPLADDER at
the END of the passageway and the outline of a TRAP DOOR in
the ceiling Tyler OPENS the door CLIMBS the ladder and
disappears through it followed by the Reverend Tyler is
heard COLLIDING with unknown objects as he scrambles to his
feet on the floor above

INT TOOLSHED DAY

A narrow beam of SUNLIGHT pours thru dark dusty air from the
one tiny window in this shed with lawn mower attachments
rakes shovels and pegboard covered walls crowded with
hanging tools Tyler AIMS his Dragonov RIFLE against his
shoulder as he makes his way cautiously to the WINDOW From
his POV he can see the church PARKING LOT where two SQUAD
CARS are now parked at haphazard angles

TYLER
(over his shoulder) Hey rev coast
is clear Gimme the stuff

The Reverend SCRAMBLES to his feet smears of DIRT and dead

GRASS clippings now marring his suit They WHISPER as he
brushes debris from his clothes

( )
25

REVEREND
What do we got

TYLER
Two squad cars in your lot No
movement but I just know they got
a colossal bucket of fuck-it
waiting for us out there

REVEREND
Language Goddamnit You’re ina
Goddamned church

TYLER
No I’m in a tool shed

REVEREND
On church property Goddamnit

TYLER SCANS the area and sees MOVEMENT in the BACK SEAT of
one of the SQUAD CARS

TYLER
Hold on We got someone in the back
of one of those cars

REVEREND
Somebody ratted you out Tyler

TYLER
Ratted me out huh

REVEREND
Sure Probably the same guy they
got in the back of that car
waiting to ID you

TYLER
Doesn’t explain why they’re zapping
out like this What’s really goin’
on here

REVEREND
Why not stay in the church

TYLER
Bad idea Rev I’d rather look at
the sun with binoculars

The Reverend peers thru the window into the yard He makes

the SIGN of the CROSS on his chest as he whispers a prayer
to himself

( )
26

TYLER
Say what

REVEREND
(as he picks up duffel bag) Talking
to my boss let’s get out of here

Tyler gently NUDGES open the shed door with the barrel of
his rifle He AIMS the rifle as he SCANS the outside for
signs of activity He sees NO ONE else

EXT CHURCH LAWN DAY

Tyler and the reverend step cautiously out of the shed to
behold a neighborhood embroiled in CHAOS and MAYHEM

MONTAGEINTERCUT berserker cops attacking the neighborhood

A) An entire FAMILY has been herded into a tight SCREAMING
GROUP on their front lawn and are SHOT like animals by
police

B) A WOMAN holding an INFANT flees from the front door of
her house Two COPS one male one female are right on her
heels they CHASE her across the lawn

C) Another woman is RUNNING around the side of a HOUSE
across the PATIO One of a row of three bay windows on the
house EXPLODES as a cop LUNGES through the splintering GLASS
and WOOD with no regard for his arms and face SNATCHES the
WOMAN and DRAGS her inside thru the window frame

D) A TEENAGER on roller blades in the road is being CHASED
by a speeding police CRUISER which runs him down
mercilessly CRUNCH

BULLETS tear and RICOCHET thru the shed and the ground
before it kicking up GRASS and DIRT Tyler and the reverend
have been SPOTTED

TYLER
Plan B Back in-fucking-side

The two RUSH back into the shed as the BULLETS keep coming
and the shadowed interior is becoming increasingly PIERCED
by pinholes of DAYLIGHT They SCRAMBLE thru the trap door
into the TUNNEL

INT CHURCH BASEMENT

TYLER and the REVEREND barge in closing the book case behind
them

TYLER
Rev turn on my scanner The police
band is preset Just hit the number
one

The Reverend picks up a pocket sized SCANNER turns it on
and hits a single button He turns up the volume Both men
LISTEN Nothing Static

TYLER
You’ve got the wrong channel

REVEREND
No I don’t

TYLER
Here give it to me

The Reverend HANDS the scanner to Tyler Tyler EXAMINES it
He presses a BUTTON labeled preset then the number ONE on
the KEYPAD

It SCANS SILENCE for a moment then STATIC

TYLER
Police can’t be off the air

REVEREND
Right Just like they can’t be
throwing furniture through the
windows

Tyler hits a button labeled SCAN on his scanner Angle on
the SCANNNER

RACING DIGITS On the LCD screen It cycles through the
bandwidth without stopping

TYLER
Nothing Some kind of interference
and smart money says the cops are
doing it

In his quest for answers Tyler puts down the scanner and
looks to the security MONITORS

( )
28

Angle on one monitor It shows the church PARKING LOT with
the two squad CARS parked on it Two uniformed COPS run to
one of the cars get inside and drive away With ONE car
LEFT the background is more visible revealing SEVERAL other
POLICE VEHICLES

Two more are PEELING OUT and leaving the scene Tyler is
eyeing the one remaining squad car it’s the one with RANIER
inside

Suddenly the scanner PICKS UP a single TRANSMISSION The
Reverend picks it up and LOOKSLISTENS It sounds like a
GAME SHOW The scanner’s LCD DISPLAY READS UHF321400

REVEREND
TV’s still on the air

TYLER
What Look we have to get out of
this town and I know how we’re
gonna do it

REVEREND
We can’t leave town We have to get
to KNLC

TYLER
The TV station Why

REVEREND
They’re jamming the radio
frequencies But they probably
can’t jam the UHF signal at the
station because the signal is too
strong We’ve got to send a
message Let the world know what’s
going on

TYLER
Well do that After we get the
hell out of town

REVEREND
And how do we do that

TYLER
Well it’s been my observation that
they’re not shooting at each other
I think we stand a chance of making
it out if we look like one of them

( )
29

REVEREND
My congregation lives in this town
and right now they need us

TYLER
well bring the cavelry Now I’m
burnin’ out of here and you’re
comin’ with me

REVEREND
You can bet they’ve got the roads
blocked and trying to break
through a road-block is suicide
you know that Now the TV station
Maybe we got a shot

TYLER
(frustrated) shit shit shit this is
insane We can argue about where
were going when I get back

REVEREND
Where are you headed

TYLER
(taps his sniper rifle) Shopping
for two police uniforms and a squad
car

TYLER opens the door and disappears into the dark staircase
leading upstairs

EXT CHURCH BELL TOWER DAY

It’s CRAMPED up here in the STEEPLE of the church There’s
barely room for TYLER to aim his DRAGONOV up here with the
enormous iron BELL taking up most of the available space

POV gun scope Tyler is looking for a target and seeing

NUMEROUS PEOPLE throughout the neighborhood lying injured or
dead in their yards on their balconies in their driveways

even in the streets The POLICE appear to be heading back to
their VEHICLES

A streak of electric CURRENT FLASHES through the air between
two rooftops It comes with a LOUD CRACKLING BUZZING noise

TYLER

(as he sees this phenomenon) What
in the Blue Hell

( )
30

No time to wonder what that was He has a TARGET to acquire
He finds his TARGET the PATROL CAR in the church lot below
with SOMEONE still in the back Cop 2 and SGT Powell are
returning to the vehicle in a HURRY

Powell gets in first driver’s side then 2 POV DRAGONOV
SCOPE Tyler Takes aim at 29 as he OPENS the passenger side
DOOR

Tyler takes the SHOT And 29 DROPS as half of his HEAD
EXPLODES in a shower of GORE

Now the Dragonov scope finds Powell in the driver’s seat
Tyler has a clear shot through the window IF he acts
quickly Powell who is already STARTING the CAR seems to
have just NOTICED his fallen comrade

Another muffled SHOT It gets Powell in the CENTER MASS but
he’s still SQUIRMING

INT SQUAD CAR DAY

POWELL is in the driver’s seat WOUNDED in the gut by
Tyler’s armor piercing round BLOOD leaks from the hole in
his flap jacket But he’s not out of commission

He’s REACHING PAINFULLY for the CB mic on his shoulder

RANIER bruised and painted with blood now LUNGES over
Powell’s shoulder from the back seat Handcuffed he thrusts
his arms over Powell’s head and PULLS back STRANGLING him
with the handcuff-chain

RANIER
citizen’s arrest motherfucker

Powell’s arms FLAIL as the choke-hold slowly extinguishes
him He becomes still But Ranier keeps TUGGING and
GROWLING until it becomes clear this is part choke-hold
part nervous breakdown

EXT BELL TOWER DAY

TYLER looks up from the Dragonov scope SURPRISED but
encouraged by what he’s just seen

He SCRAMBLES down the rickety staircase in the floor of the
bell tower

INT CHURCH BASEMENT DAY
TYLER BURSTS into the room

The REVEREND levels his AK at the INTRUSION until he
recognizes his friend Tyler opens the BOOKCASE and steps
into the passageway

TYLER
Our ride’s here Get the bag Pack
up all the C4 and the Semtex and
the detonators

REVEREND
Why bring that stuff

TYLER
(OS inside passageway) Got a
feeling we might need it Let’s go
We’re off like a prom dress

EXT CHURCH LAWN DAY
The tool SHED doors FLY open this time

TYLER and the REVEREND come out SPRINTING for the one
remaining squad CAR

Tyler reaches the vehicle first he calls to the Reverend as
he YANKS Powell out of the driver’s seat and begins removing
his UNIFORM

TYLER
hey Rev You see that dead cop

REVEREND
(arriving breathless) Yeah

TYLER
Put his uniform on Now

The Reverend gives Tyler a DISGUSTED LOOK then puts the
uniform on

RANIER still handcuffed in the back seat of the car sticks
his head out the window He almost looks like he’s been
MAULED by a grizzly bear at this point BLOOD and BRUISES
have him covered in shades of red blue and black

RANIER
Oh thank fucking Christ you guys
are here Get me out of these
(MORE )

( )

RANIER (contd)

these cuffs Oh God oh merciful

Oh fucking-

REVEREND

to Hell

TYLER
(in Powell’s uniform now) Hell’s
already here

REVEREND
(looks at new blood spattered
attire) Is this quite necessary

TYLER
Fraid so

Uniformed the two JUMP INTO the front seats of the cruiser
LEAVING two dead men in their UNDERWEAR on the lawn

INT POLICE CRUISER DAY

TYLER and the REVEREND both look like extremely bloody
policemen

A police issue TWELVE GUAGE rests on a holster between them
Ranier in the back leans forward and holds his arms out
still cuffed

RANIER
Please get these off me

Tyler turns to look at Ranier and his situation He notes
the handcuffs then the twelve guage Tyler grabs the twelve
gauge PUMPS IT with his right hand and aims it at the chain
linking the cuffs pressing it to the ceiling of the car

TYLER
Close your eyes homeboy

Tyler pulls the trigger The BLAST makes short work of the
cuff chain puts a HOLE through the roof of the cruiser and
SHATTERS the red and blue ROOFTOP LIGHTS in the bargain

Then Thru the CB comes the now familiar deep DEMONIC VOICE

( )
33

DEMON VOICEDISPATCH
Eleven Twenty nine What’s your
twenty

TYLER
you hear that

REVEREND
Man’s got a voice like three miles
of gravel road

RANIER
They’ve all been talking in that
same voice

TYLER
Wait a minute they’re not on their
usual bandwidth what’s that about

REVEREND
(concerned) Don’t answer that Ty

Tyler turns the CB off fires up the cruiser and they PEEL
OFF down the street

INT SQUAD CAR DUSK

Daylight is waning now As the three through town a
smorgasbord of SLAUGHTER and CHAOS comes into view The
police have not only KILLED most of the population and
DRAGGED them OUTSIDE but have SABOTAGED or BURNED much of
the TOWN itself

HOUSES STORE FRONTS VEHICLES PLAYGROUNDS all VANDALIZED
and DISFIGURED SMOKE billows into the sky from dozens of
points past the horizons

RANIER is damn near HYPERVENTILATING as he surveys the
destruction TYLER looks mildly DISTURBED by it as he
drives The Reverend is somewhere in the middle

REVEREND
Tyler Jonathon Perelta I may not
know what is happening or why but
I do know this God has called upon
us

TYLER
Really Cuz my phone isn’t ringing
right now Hey maybe maybe God’s
got a shitty wireless plan or
something

( )
34

REVEREND
We can’t walk away from this

TYLER
(as he swerves left) Damn skippy
That’s why we’re driving away from

this

REVEREND
Innocent people are in danger They
need us

Tyler SWERVES right onto a freeway ON-RAMP

TYLER
Yeah Well we’re some of those
people and we need us Now put
your seat belt on

REVEREND
(in Tyler’s face) My soul is among
lions and I lie among them that
are set on fire

TYLER
Again with the fire and brimstone
And didn’t I tell you to put your
seat belt on

REVEREND
Yes why

TYLER
(points ahead) Cuz we’re taking a
shortcut to your precious TV
station and me thinks its gonna be
a bumpy ride

The cruiser is on a curved ramp leading to an OVERPASS now
and beyond the exit ramp is a steep EMBANKMENT leading to a
shallow CREEK then a FLOODPLAIN with park BENCHES and a
SWING SET then a steep HILL with a large BUILDING and a
transmitting TOWER with the letters KNLC at the summit

Tyler is not steering the into the bend anymore He’s
GUNNING it toward the embankment

the cruiser PLUNGES thru the guardrail down the embankment
JOLTING and SPLASHING across the creek onto the playground
STRIKING the swingset and a picnic table as they PLOW thru
and up the HILL with tires SPINNING and soil FLYING behind
them

( )
35

It LEAPS onto the lot from the edge of the embankment
dented scratched plastered with foliage and grinds to a
HALT in the middle of the parking LOT

Angle on the building’s rooftop TRANSMITTER several POLICE
are up there doing something to it

Gets the SWAT man right through the head but he falls on
the trigger and STARTS the timer 1459 1458 1457

Tyler SNIPES two more of them before they REALIZE whats
happening to them The third is FOLLOWED by the SCOPE as he
scrambles inside through a SERVICE DOOR but Tyler can’t get
a shot now

TYLER
One of them got away and the
detonator is armed giving us
fourteen minutes to do something
about it On a personal note I have
now killed five policemen life as
I know it is over

REVEREND
I have a feeling life as we all
know it is over

TYLER
I didn’t get a good look at that
bomb but depending on what type it
is I might be able to disarm it
But I have to be on that roof in
five minutes Meantime you guys get

situation and take control

TYLER FIRES UP the engine and they start for the LOADING
DOCK
EXT LOADING DOCK DUSK

TYLER eases the CRUISER slowly into to the last parking
space next to the loading dock He turns to the other two

TYLER
Ok if this is going to work we’ll
have to split up meaning I go up
to the roof and take care of that
bomb while you guys get to the
studio and find the news desk See
if there’s anyone in there who can
help you Don’t think just shoot
anything with a badge

RANIER
Oh Jesus on a stick

REVEREND
I don’t want to pair up with him

TYLER
Why not

RANIER
Oh merciful Christ we are so
fucked

REVEREND

The Reverend reaches into their BAG of goodies
for the right ammunition

he’s looking

One by one he picks out a group of long slender pointed
bullets with 762 mm embossed on the shell casings He gets

about ten of them then he picks out two large

straight

semi-automatic CLIPS Then a spare BANANA clip for his AK
Ranier watches the other two as they lock and load with smug

determination

there is yes

TYLER enters the control room to find the Reverend and Roger
both staring at the AC duct

( )
44

REVEREND
(pointing) Roger says this is our
way out

ROGER PULLS the GRATE off the AC duct revealing an ESCAPE
with about TWO AND A HALF FEET of space to squeeze through
ROGER crawls in first followed by the REVEREND and then
TYLER

ROGER
Last one in put the grate back on

TYLER puts the GRATE back from inside ENCLOSING them They
get about three steps into the duct when they HEAR many
FOOTFALLS pour into the STUDIO

TYLER
(whispering) Move quietly

INT TV STATION SUB-BASEMENT DAY

It is a LARGE LOW ROOM with cinder block walls and no drop
ceiling

A GRATE in one of the EXPOSED VENTILATION DUCTS running
along the ceiling is STRUCK several times with an OBJECT
that turns out to be the BUTT of a RIFLE as the grate is
DETACHED and falls to the floor with the final strike

First TYLER drops out then the REVEREND then RANIER then
the duffel bag which is caught by Tyler as it is dropped
then ROGER All four dust themselves off

ROGER
I don’t get it What’s wrong with
them

RANIER

I don’t know I think they’re on

something man Hopped up I mean
maybe these fuckers got into the

evidence locker or something

ROGER
Maybe it’s some kind of chemical
warfare like terrorism

REVEREND
I’‘1l tell you what’s wrong with
them They’re possessed by a demon
one of the worst

Awkward SILENCE

( )

TYLER
Ok Rev Ranier’s theory was
unlikely Roger’s was frankly out
there but demons You gotta be
shittin’ me

REVEREND
The writing was on the wall Ty

TYLER
Thou speakest in riddles Thou
needest to cut that shit out now

REVEREND
Behind you at the news-desk It
was written in blood Abaddon is
the Angel of the bottomless pit
referred to in Revelation He was
given power over the locusts who
were eating up the land We’ve met
some of those locusts this
afternoon They had ‘serve and
protect’ written on the side of
their cars

TYLER
Ok now I know you’ve gone loony
tunes Anytime someone starts
quoting Revelations - the kookiest
book in the bible as I have heard
you call it they’re loony tunes

RANIER
No he’s right about them calling
themselves Abaddon They’ve been
saying that all afternoon and some
crap about bottomless pits or
megahertz

TYLER
You’re both loony tunes What we
need to be discussing is how to get
out of here Now all this climbing
through ventilation ducts
a-la-Die-Hard has given me an idea
The storm drains There should be
an opening here This is the
sub-basement Paradise Falls is in
a valley It has an extensive
drainage system to keep the streets
and basements from flooding

( )
46

RANIER
How are we going to get a message
out now

TYLER

I can only think of one way to get
the world’s attention now and it’s
dangerous So I’ll be flying solo
on this

REVEREND
What do you have in mind

TYLER
We gotta blow something up
Something that makes a big
Goddamned boom

RANIER
The nearest town - where God wiling
the same thing is not occurring -
is Pendalton and that’s fifteen
Goddamned miles away

ROGER
Yeah I mean what do you plan to
blow up that’s gonna be seen that
far away

TYLER
What I have in mind would easily be
seen from fifty miles At night
probably as far away as Topeka

REVEREND
We don’t have anything in this town
that would make an explosion that
big

TYLER
Yes we do The propane refinery

ROGER
No shit That would take out half
the town in the process

TYLER
Not quite But anything inside a
thousand yards of the place would
be toast They’ve got propane
storage tanks there fifty feet
long I got enough C4 to blow all
of them and the detonators to do

(MORE)
( )
47

TYLER (contd)
it by remote So you see I’m going
hard with this now

REVEREND
But first we’ll need a map of the
storm drains in this town Figure
out where we can and can’t go

RANIER
City Hall The zoning
commissioner’s office has all of
that on file

ROGER
Alright I think the drain under
here runs down to the playground
That’1ll get us far enough from the
station

TYLER
From there we’1ll follow the creek
It runs right past city hall Find
me a manhole or something that
looks like it

The four SPLIT UP and start LOOKING for a WAY OUT

FADE TO

INT SUB-BASEMENT

RANIER is in the corner looking through a gap in a large
stack of LARGE PLASTIC BARRELS He CALLS to the others0

REVEREND
Hey fellas I think I got it

The OTHER THREE join him peering through the gap

REVEREND
There’s a metal grate back there I
hear water running Help me move
these

TYLER TIPS OVER an entire STACK of the BARRELS They come
CRASHING to the floor

The OTHER THREE CLEAR AWAY remaining barrels to REVEAL a
MANHOLE with a GRATE back by the wall The sound of
TRICKLING WATER emanates from beneath

Tyler and the Reverend HEAVE the grate aside and PEER in

EXT DRAINPIPE EXIT NIGHT

The FOUR EXIT through a FOUR FOOT drain PIPE from which a
trickle of water leaks DOWNHILL to the CREEK They are just
beneath the playground The REVEREND and TYLER both have
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES cocked up over their foreheads

TYLER
This way Stay close and stay quiet

EXT BEHIND COURTHOUSE NIGHT

The FOUR creep through the park silently all armed except
ROGER keeping their guns trained and ready to shoot They
come to a BACK DOOR of City Hall It is LOCKED with a
KEYCARD entry panel mounted on the wall next to it

TYLER tries the door An enormous current of STATIC
ELECTRICITY covers Tyler’s hand as he touches the knob The
BRIGHT FLASH BURNS his hand He RECOILS from it

TYLER
Ouch What in Samhain was that
ROGER
Holy heck it’s real
REVEREND
What’s real
ROGER
The electromagnetic field blocking
communications
TYLER

(as he shakes his burning hand) Yes
we know that thank you

ROGER
No you don’t understand That’s why
you got jolted Static charges are
going to keep building up in
conductive objects Metal glass
wood people

REVEREND
We’re all going to start getting
zapped like that

ROGER
The human body is highly
conductive It makes a great
antenna

( )

TYLER
Ok terrific Static electricity is
now strong enough to do this

TYLER
holds out the HAND he used to touch
the door knob Several of his
fingers are BURNED with streaks of
RED AND BLACK

RANIER
Let’s get the Hell inside I don’t
like being out here

TYLER
Yeah let’s do that

EXTCITY HALL COURTYARD NIGHT

The FOUR SNEAK up on the front of CITY HALL It is
the street from the COURTHOUSE and the FOUNTIAN OF

DEATH

When they

SEE IT they STOP and are STUNNED

across
BLOODY

Angle on the FOUNTAIN with its MOUNTAIN of DEAD bodies

which is much LARGER now

BLOOD on the Courthouse DOORS

ABADDON IS LAW

TALLER AND the INSCRIPTION in

RANIER turns and VOMITS immediately And AGAIN The other

three are

too stunned for words The REVEREND makes

of the cross on his chest

REVEREND
Lord God bless these innocent
souls and accept them into your
kingdom

RANIER
(on his knees) I know those people
oh God I know them (turns to look)
Cassy Robert Luke Martin Roz

Anthony they were court clerks
Annette Morgan she was a public
defender for Christ sake And oh
merciful fucking Christ (beat)

REVEREND
They all worked at the courthouse

RANIER
(crying now) yes Yes

REVEREND
this demon is sending us a message
He wants us to know he makes the
rules

TYLER
So we’re sending messages now OK

TYLER turns to the courthouse DRAWS both FIFTY CAL
automatics and MAKES SHORT WORK of the GLASS walled LOBBY
TYLER marches INSIDE

The others FOLLOW

As they walk inside each one in turn SETS OFF the METAL
DETECTOR

INT COURTHOUSEZONING COMMISSION OFFICE

The OFFICE is a CUBE FARM partitioned off into dozens of
CUBICLES All FOUR of them are SEARCHING the place

ZAP another current of ELECTRICITY leaps from one of the
desktop COMPUTERS

TYLER
(OS) OW Why do I keep getting
zapped

ROGER

Some people are better conductors
than others It’s been postulated
that that is the mechanism behind
spontaneous human combustion

RANIER
(distracted upset) Try to find
blueprints Maps

ROGER

Got it This is the Irrigation
Development Office

( )
51

The others RUSH to roger’s cubicle He is UNFOLDING a large
BLUEPRINT of the town’s IRRIGATION SYSTEM Angle on the
blueprint it shows all the drain pipes running under the
streets of the town TYLER points to an AREA OF PROPERTY in
the upper left hand corner

TYLER
Here’s the propane refinery

REVEREND
You’ve got a drain running from
here to here but nothing leading
onto the property

ROGER
Nothing on the map anyway

RANIER
EPA rules You can’t let runoff
from a plant like that into a
watershed

TYLER
How old are those laws

RANIER
Clean water act has been on the
books since the 1972

TYLER
Propane plant’s been around a lot
longer than that

REVEREND
What are you thinking Ty

The SOUND of FOOTFALLS in the hallway TYLER is the first to
hear them

TYLER
(hushed)Get down and spread out
Rog stay with me

The overhead LIGHTS go OUT as The REVEREND (with duffel bag)
and RANIER MOVE OFF in opposite directions

Each hunkers down in neighboring cubicles as a SWAT UNIT
POURS into the room FANNING OUT SEARCHING Spotlights pour
through the room

TYLER is the first to be SPOTTED by a SWAT He’s lying under
a desk with the DRAGONOV already poised

( )
52

Tyler gets him quietly he DROPS The other units haven’t
noticed yet Tyler DRAGS the body in gaining a COMPACT
SUB-MACHINE GUN for ROGER He hands it to him Silently
shows him where the trigger is how to hold it

Roger’s EYES WIDEN Someone is BEHIND them Tyler’s back is
turned no time ROGER pushes TYLER aside and SQUEEZES OFF
half a dozen rounds at a FEMALE SWAT who FIRES BACK

The SWAT is only GRAZED ON THE SHOULDER ANOTHER round hits
her FLAP JACKET ROGER however takes MULTIPLE SHOTS and is
BLOWN AWAY

CHAOS and AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE fill the room now DEBRIS
made by the STORM of gunfire FLIES in all directions
Tyler’s cubicle is taking heavy fire a SHITSTORM RAINS DOWN
as he TAKES COVER He can’t even get a shot

KBLOOM A GRENADE EXPLODES in the hallway

TWO MORE live ones are TOSSED to opposite ends of the cube
farm From the Reverend’s cubicle as the next two lovely
parting gifts EXPLODE LEVELING a third of the cube farm HE
is LOBBING GRENADES with IMPUNITY

REVEREND
(agitated) y’all wanna get the
Reverend angry OK Reverend Angry
Now

He THOWS TWO MORE BOOM and BOOM

REVEREND
Reverend coming to DEAL with evil
Stay tuned mothafuckers Stay
tuned

The Reverend STANDS and SPRAYS the THREE remaining
SWATS with a STORM of HOT LEAD

TYLER EMERGES from his cube brandishing a THROWING BLADE He
PITCHES it HARD and GETS ONE of the one of the remaining
three RIGHT THROUGH the EYE The man DROPS over DEAD

Then Tyler DRAWS HIS 50 CAL HANDGUNS and EMPTIES A CLIP
into EACH the remaining TWO blowing the ARM off of one and
the HEAD and LEFT SHOULDER off of the last

DEBRIS still RAINS to the floor The SPRINKLER SYSTEM

engages SHOWERING everything FINGERS of ELECTRICITY LEAP
across the DEVESTATED room

( )

TYLER
Reverend (beat) don’t let that
Semtex get zapped (beat) you hear
me

Hearing no response Tyler TURNS to find the REVEREND
standing with his weapon lowered looking at a VERY DECEASED
Roger He is laid out on a desk PUNCTURED and BLOODY TYLER

approaches

as RANIER in the background FINISHES OFF two

dying SWATS Each shot from his 12 gauge THUNDERS throughout

the room

A MOAN from a wounded SWAT on the floor

SWAT who
shotgun

TYLER
He pushed me He saved my life

REVEREND
This has to end This evil presence
must be banished to Hell

TYLER
You really think this is a demon

REVEREND
Tyler you and I have never seen
eye to eye on the subject of
demons and of Hell but these
things are real Perhaps we don’t
understand them fully but they
exist I know this enemy and so
does the bible

TYLER
Abaddon

REVEREND
Angel of the bottomless pit

TYLER
Just what and where is this
bottomless pit

REVEREND
-A metaphor perhaps for the place
this thing has been hiding a pit
A cage And this thing has to be
put back in it

It’s the female

killed Roger She’s SQUIRMING Ranier COCKS his

and AIMS it at her

( )
54

RANIER
I got this one

REVEREND
Wait

The other two follow

Angle on the FEMALE SWAT She’s discarded her helmet and
vest now and is REVEALED to be a BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN with
long ropey hair Her FACE is pulled into a SCOWL Though
IMMOBILIZED she’s clearly POSSESSED She’s GROWLING and
GRIMICING

REVEREND
Who are you Why are you doing
this
SWAT
(demonic) Abaddon is law
RANIER
What say we just euthanize the
bitch
REVEREND
She’s not the enemy None of them
are
RANIER

Excuse me Did she not just murder
the shit out of roger just now

REVEREND
Abaddon murdered him

RANIER
Yes yes The devil made her do it
Bullshit

REVEREND

Well just see about that

The REVEREND reaches inside his flap jacket and pulls out a
POCKET-SIZED BIBLE SHE RECOILS as the SPRINKLERS cut OFF
and more BZZAAP Of electric current comes from HERE and
THERE

REVEREND
In the name of my Lord Christ Jesus
I command you foul fetid spirit to
come out

( )
55

SWAT girl HOWLS Ranier looks on disgusted The Reverend
PLACES the BIBLE against her forehead

REVEREND
Leave the body of this innocent
woman I command you in the name of
the everlasting Lord of Lords King
of Kings

She SCREAMS WRITHING and CLAWING at herself

RANIER
I don’t think this hocus-pocus
monkey-shit is helping right now
preacher

TYLER turns and COLD COCKS Ranier Ranier DROPS his gun and
hits the floor HER screaming INTENSIFIES

REVEREND
Putrid devil you leave this body
now In the name of the Almighty
Father The Son And Holy spirit
I cast you out of this innocent
body In the name of the almighty
Father God In the Name of Christ
Jesus be gone

The REVEREND GRABS her as he chants and HOLDS her close with
the BIBLE between them Her SCREAMING and SCOWLING builds to
a CRESCENDO

FINGERS OF BLUE CURRENT come ZAPPING from all across the
room CONVERGING on the REVEREND and the SWAT girl Both are
KNOCKED on their backs UNCONSCIOUS TYLER RUSHES to the
Reverend’s side RANIER gets up slowly DAZED

TYLER
Rev Owen
RANIER
(sits up dazed) Wha’ th’ Hell jus’

happened

The REVEREND snaps out of it He gets to his feet he’s in
better shape than Ranier

The GIRL is CONSCIOUS now she is CRYING SOFTLY The

Reverend approaches her Turns her over she is a little
BEAT UP but clearly EXORCISED of the presence of Abaddon

( )
56

REVEREND
Can you tell us your name

ATHENA
Athena I remember everything Oh
God I am so sorry Oh God I-

REVEREND
It wasn’t you

ATHENA
It was (beat) he made me do it
but I did it my unit killed a bus
full of high school students this
afternoon

REVEREND
Sister listen to me You are not
responsible for the existence of
evil it does not make you evil It
is a force beyond your control Can
you stand

ATHENA
Yeah(gets to her feet) The rest of
my team are they (can’t find
the words)

REVEREND

Yes I’m sorry

ATHENA
(another tear) I remember
everything I know what he’s trying
to do We have to-

K’klack RANIER AIMS his shotgun at her and PUMPS another
slug into the chamber The Reverend HOLDS his HAND up to
Ranier

REVEREND
Don’t even think about it

RANIER
Oh I’m way past thinking about it

GIRL
That thing is out of me OK

RANIER
No not OK Now the Reverend here
maybe he goes for that hocus pocus
demonic possession shit but I

( )
57

RANIER (contd)
think otherwise You don’t just
wave a magic wand toss some voodoo
chicken bones around and become one
of the good guys

ATHENA
What are you going to do Shoot me
just for some piece of mind

RANIER
Sounds like a plan

Tyler shoulders his DRAGONOV and looks at RANIER (who is
still pointing the shotgun) with DISGUST

Tyler TAKES CHARGE now Slipping underneath Ranier’s arm
GRABBING him at the elbow and FLIPPING him JUDO style over
his back and down to the floor

SMACK Tyler has Ranier’s shotgun pointed down at him now as
he lies flat on his back

TYLER
I’ve had just about enough of you
kum-dumpster

Ranier throws a TANTRUM Shouting up at TYLER

RANIER
I’ve seen so much Death Murder
everyone I work with everyone I
know dead Fucking dead

REVEREND
I’m starting to wish you’d joined
them

TYLER

I suppose the devil’s cutting you a
break for the moment because he
knows you’re a damn shoe -in for
Hell

ATHENA

Please (trying not to cry) Don’t
you get it This is what it wants
More conflict more hate That’s
what this thing is hate It wants
us to tear our species to shreds
It wants to make us kill each other
for its amusement Shake up the jar
and make ‘em fight like a bunch of

fucking insects That’s all we are
to him

REVEREND
Locusts And they had a king over
them whose name in the Hebrew
tongue is Abaddon Revelations
nine verse eleven Nine one one
now tell me there are no codes in
the bible

She LEANS back against a cubicle WALL and SLIDES down into
a SQUATTING position EXHAUSTED SILENCE for a beat or two
and

REVEREND
Athena what can you tell us about
all this

ATHENA
My team was dispatched to eliminate
all of you except Tyler Perelta
and capture him Abaddon wants to
know where your armor piercing
ammunition and explosives came
from He already knows what you’re
planning to do at the propane
plant He’s got the place staked
out

TYLER
Does he know we’re planning to get
there through the storm drains

ATHENA
No but it’s only a matter of time
before he figures it out

REVEREND
The information he does have where
does he get it

ATHENA
He’s a demon older than time His
IQ is off the charts I shared his
mind and believe me most of what
he knows is beyond our
comprehension He knows he can’t
hide from the rest of the world
much longer He knows a military
presence is inevitable He wants
that He has plans for the

ATHENA (cont’d)
military but he’s not through with
us yet

REVEREND
Why not yet

ATHENA
He wants to know about you Tyler
He’s lifted your fingerprints from
the TV station He’s found your
records - criminal medical
employment - all sealed by order of
the Department of Defense He wants
to know why Frankly I want to
know why

The REVEREND and TYLER exchange HEAVY glances

REVEREND
Might as well spill it brother

TYLER
I sell weapons explosives to all
kinds of clients some of whom are
fighting wars in which America has
a vested interest Oh sure battles
that America can’t openly support
are going on all the time all over
the place But Uncle Sam doesn’t
want to get his red-white-n-blue
hands dirty That’s where I come
in

ATHENA
I’ve heard of you The department’s
been trying to nail you guys for
years They could never get a
search warrant or a wire tap order
or anything You’re saying we were
being federally stonewalled to
protect your clientele’s best
interests

REVEREND
America’s best interests We were
what some would call a necessary
evil

ATHENA
Make no mistake - there is a place
called Hell and this thing does
not meet with Hell’s approval Hell

(MORE)
( )

ATHENA (cont’d)
has rules Abaddon couldn’t follow
them That’s why he’s here He’s
too fucked up for Hell

TYLER
Seems to me we should attack this
thing at its source Where did it
come from

ATHENA
The airwaves photons Hell sent it
there in exile but Hell made a
mistake

Another BRANCHING CURRENT of STATIC leaps from the ceiling
to multiple points in the WRECKAGE of the cube farm

TYLER
Static-cling’ The whole town’s
getting it

ATHENA
The mobile phone jammers are
causing it They’re in the trunks
of the squad cars And they’ve got
additional units planted throughout
the town it’s creating a static
electrical field

TYLER
Alright so we’ve got two theatres
of operations Rev you and Ranier
take one of the SWAT trucks look
for survivors on your way to the
church It’s hallowed ground there
Weve seen them They can’t touch
it Meanwhile I will be headed for
the propane refinery

ATHENA
I’m trained in explosives And I
know the propane plant Two of us
will have that place wired in half
the time

The FOUR EXIT the room STEPPING OVER dead BODIES and

cube-farm

AFTERMATH as they go

FADE TO

EXTDRAIN-PIPE ENTRANCE NIGHT

TYLER and ATHENA’S SWAT van CROSSES a small BRIDGE over a
concrete DRAINAGE DITCH Its dry bed is generously clogged
with rocks tree trunks and other debris

It runs into a four foot DRAIN PIPE at an embankment that
runs underneath a hilly wooded area Tyler and Athena both
EXIT the truck WEARING NIGHT VISION goggles They TRUDGE

down to the ENTRANCE of the TUNNEL

ATHENA
Hey gun-runner Hey merchant of
death Let me get something
straight alright I’m working with
you on this one But I’m a cop and
you’re a criminal so there won’t
be any candle-light dinners or long
walks in the park ok

Tyler PRETENDS to CRY for a moment

FADE TO

INT DRAIN-PIPENIGHT POV NIGHT VISION

Tyler and Athena come to a JUNCTION with three OTHER STORM
DRAINS of varying size They’re in a large concrete cavern
awash with the sound of dripping and running water its
DIRTY CONCRETE dimensions are BIG enough for them to STAND
in

Suddenly FLASHLIGHT BEAMS reveal uniformed SOLDIERS FOUR
OF THEM all with GUNS trained on Tyler and Athena

SOLDIER1
Drop your weapons

Tyler sees INSIGNIA on their UNIFORMS It reads PandORA He
and Athena lay their weapons down slowly

TYLER
You do exist

SOLDIER 1
officially we don’t and neither do
your plans to destroy the propane
refinery

TYLER
And how’s that

( )
62

FOOTSTEPS ANOTHER SOLDIER enters the junction from one of
the larger drainpipes It is an OFFICER An older white man
with graying hair Lines of age on his face tells us he’s in
charge

OFFICER
Tyler Perelta You have had a
number of guardian angels in this
world over the years the DOD the
CIA the NSA but only one
agency can help you now

TYLER
Oh here we go with the Cloak and
Dagger shit

ATHENA
You know these jarheads

TYLER
Heard of them PandORA Stands for
Paranormal and Occult Related
Affairs Rumored to be the
intelligence division of the
Vatican Army among other things
Essentially if the Ghostbusters
worked for the CIA they’d be
these clowns

OFFICER
Mr Parelta your home town of
Paradise Falls has shown up on our
paranormal RADAR We have a
satellite grid that tracks
supernatural activity and you have
a very large energy signature here
Large and quite malignant demonic
we believe in fact it’s the most
powerful we’ve ever seen

TYLER
So why are we talking
SOLDIER2
You won’t be blowing up the propane

refinery

Tyler in CU takes a GLOB of something out of his duffel
bag and slips it into a side pocket)

OFFICER
At six AM tomorrow morning A
chemical weapon will be released
(MORE )

( )

OFFICER (cont’d)
Officially It will be the act of
terrorists but your country will
never find them

SOLDIER1
Hand over the bag

Tyler holds the duffel BAG out and DROPS it

OFFICER
(as he inspects the bag) We’ve
been at work for centuries Mr
Perelta

TYLER
Then take a fuckin’ coffee break

OFFICER
The Chicago fire of 1871 the
Halifax explosion The second bomb
dropped on Nagasaki The
supernatural threatens our way of
life all the time But the greatest
threat is public knowledge of its
existence You’d be surprised how
many of history’s major disasters
have been manufactured to hide
things far more threatening

ATHENA
The truth is never a threat

OFFICER
In times like this it is the
ultimate threat

TYLER
Wait a minute Mrs O-Leary’s cow

OFFICER
I beg your pardon

TYLER
That’s The best cover story you
could manage Some Irish chick’s
cow kicked over a lantern set the
whole city of Chicago on fire Are
you shittin’ me

OFFICER
We won’t put a stop to your mission
without giving you alternatives

( )
64

TYLER
Oh yeah Alternatives Like what
Instead of the propane refinery
maybe we blow up the donut shop
Sure we’ll get about half the cops
in the explosion and how long
could the rest of them survive
without donuts

ATHENA pissed at Tyler’s stereotyping of police TURNS to
him with her ARM COCKED for a punch

ATHENA
Oh now see you’re gettin’ ready to
taste the motherfuckin’ rainbow

TYLER OPENS his MOUTH to speak but is DISTRACTED by Soldier
2 KICKING aside Tyler’s duffel BAG and replacing it with
TWO OTHER duffel BAGS that he brings from the shadows

TYLER
What’s in those

OFFICER
See for yourself

SOLDIER 1
You’1l never kill a demon with a
projectile weapon Demons exist as
pure energy Fight fire with fire

Tyler crouches down and opens the bags He pulls a STRANGE
LOOKING RIFLE out of one of them

TYLER
What in the blue Hell is this

SOLDIER2
Laser guided plasma prototype

ATHENA
You’re telling me these are actual
hand-held energy weapons

SOLDIER 2
Experimental Their range and
accuracy is Poor But they have a
lot of stopping power inside of a
hundred and twenty feet

SOLDIER 1
They overheat They’re unstable
For that matter the plasma makes a
terrible smell

( )

SOLDIER 2
We suggest you be far away from
this town at six AM We’1l be

TYLER
Right Because Heaven forbid you
should have to go and hunt this
demon yourself

OFFICER
Heaven forbid

ATHENA
If you’re going scorched earth with
all this why even bother dropping
off these ‘who knows might blow in
your face’ Laser guns

SOLDIER 1
LASER guided plasma-

TYLER
(cuts soldier off) Ultimate kitchen
tool it slices it dices it makes
Julianne fucking fries Whatever
Why

SOLDIER2
Want to stay alive Want to save
this town This world We’re giving
you a chance to do these things

ATHENA
You guys are in over your heads
aren’t you This demon is bigger
than you That’s why you’re pawning
this shit off on us because you
can’t handle your business

OFFICER
Well be watching Our satellites
see everything You will not play
whistle blower Leave this place
and do not attempt to destroy the
refinery or draw any other outside
attention to this

The OFFICER WALKS back into the DRAINPIPE The SOLDIERS
FOLLOW The leaping SHADOWS of legs and arms along the walls

FADE until they are gone

left only in the infrared light of

Tyler and Athena’s NIGHT VISION

INT SWAT TRUCK 2 NIGHT

The REVEREND is DRIVING SPEEDING down a back ALLEY with
RANIER in the passenger seat BESIDE him SOMETHING CATCHES
the Reverend’s EYE a GROUP of PEOPLE in the dark distance
MOVING from a HOUSE to a CAR The Reverend STOPS a block
away He turns the HEADLIGHTS OFF and KILLS the ENGINE but
they’ve ALREADY been NOTICED a SPATE of GUNFIRE HITS the
armored TRUCK A FEW of the HEAVIER rounds crack and chip
the windshield glass slightly but nothing punches through
The constant noise of ricocheting bullets continues as
Ranier and Reverend discuss the situation

RANIER
Cops civilians I don’t care who
they are If they’re trying to
shoot us they gotta go

REVEREND
I disagree

The Reverend LOOKS AT the LOUDSPEAKER controls on the
dashboard He PICKS UP the chorded HAND-MIC and HOLDS it UP
to his mouth With his index FINGER he is SCANNING rows of
BUTTONS along the dash A handful of them are BOXED OFF from
the rest under the heading INTERCOM He ZEROES IN on those
BUTTONS He’s FOUND what he’s LOOKING for A KNOB labeled
VOLUME He TURNS the knob UP all he way Then another marked
LOUDSPEAKER The Reverend SQUEEZES the TALK BUTTON on the
side of the CB mic

REVEREND
(LOUDSPEAKER) You can stop
shooting We’re not police I’m
from Paradise Lutheran church

RANIER
They’re panicked civilians They’re
just as much of a threat as the
cops

REVEREND
Then feel free to cower in here

The Reverend squeezes the talk button

REVEREND
We’re going to pull the truck up
into the driveway so we can talk in
person Ok

TWO MORE GUNSHOTS

Pleased the Reverend cracks a slight SMILE and PULLS the
van SLOWLY up the street into the DRIVEWAY

In the BACKGROUND a static ELECTRICAL CHARGE CUTS through
the night air LEAPING from a TRANSFORMER atop a telephone
POLE to an old ANTENNA on a ROOFTOP

Ranier OPENS his mouth to SAY something but the Reverend
HOLDS his HAND to him silencing him

REVEREND
Save it Your ‘self preservation’
shtick is beginning to bore me

The SWAT van PULLS INTO the DRIVEWAY where a FAMILY of six
SURVIVORS - who are still not sure who they are dealing with
- keep their GUNS AIMED squarely at the TRUCK Mom Dad
three boys and a teenage girl all packing hardware they
look far too young or inexperienced to be messing with The

Reverend OPENS his WINDOW
The Reverend SMILES

TYLER and ATHENA are MAKING their WAY thru the dank
DRAIN-PIPE they have to stay HUNCHED DOWN to WALK in here
With less than a hundred feet ahead MOONLIGHT can be seen
at the END of the TUNNEL

( )
69

TYLER

You were right you know what you
said back there They are in over
their heads on this one and they
know it They have no idea if any
of their plans are gong to work
Unfortunately for them the part
where I give two shits has been
cancelled for this evening

ATHENA
What are you talking about

TYLER
We now return you to your regularly
scheduled bullshit

Athena stops folds her arms Looks at Tyler confused

ATHENA
Hey Gun runner They got this new
shit out now it’s called making
sense when you talk

TYLER

(stops walking turns to her) OK
it’s like this we’re gonna get
back in the truck and perpetrate
like we’re burning out of here
because of course PandORA will be
watching On our way across the
bridge however I’m going to duck
out back into the drainage ditch
and your going to keep on driving

ATHENA
Why

TYLER
I gotta light a fire under the
world’s ass Let them know
something’s going on here

ATHENA
So why do this Why put our ass on
the line when you can just cut and
run

TYLER
PandORA got it wrong The world
needs to know If supernatural
threats to our way of life really
do exist the world deserves to
(MORE )

( )
70

TYLER (contd)
know the truth and the details
And it deserves to be given credit
for its potential to wrap its mind
around this and do something about
it (beat) It’s like this If
humanity can survive break-dancing
it can survive anything this
universe could ever fling in its
direction including this I have
to blow the whistle And I have to
do that by making a big God damn
boom

ATHENA
Even if it means getting yourself
killed Which it probably will

TYLER
Life’s a rough sport - wear a cup

ATHENA
You know something gun runner I
dig your world view But answer me
this Those spooks took your
explosives How you going to blow
up the joint with a Zippo and some
greasy rags

TYLER
Yeah Spooks took all my
explosives All except this one big
sweaty glob of Semtex I had stashed
in my pocket here

Tyler pulls out a GRAPEFRUIT SIZED BALL of SEMTEX

TYLER
(cont) So I suppose this will have
to do You got any insulated wire
in that SWAT truck

ATHENA
A five hundred foot spool of it
But you need a spark to detonate
Your remote hardware has been
taken What’s that leave

Tyler pulls a TASER GUN off of the belt on Athena’s hip and
holds it up between them

( )
71

TYLER
These things have a range of what
like ten feet

ATHENA
This one shoots fifteen

TYLER
That should be plenty

Tyler PULLS OUT his MAPS He is LOOKING FOR the BLUEPRINTS
to the propane plant He FINDS them and OPENS them They are
LOOKING AT a MAP of the REFINERY

TYLER
There’s a storm drain that connects
with the property by the southeast
corner of the basement level Now
to make everything blow Ill have
to set charges here here and
here (points to several different
parts of blueprints) Then I gotta
go topside up this service
entrance for the finished propane
Then I get back into the basement
shoot the first charge with this
Tazer and haul ass

ATHENA
You’1l have to haul a lot of ass to
get away from a blast that big
You’1l be crawling through a two
foot storm drain You won’t have a
prayer

TYLER
Then say one for me

ATHENA
Please lord help this no good
career criminal get away from the
inferno he’s about to set off
(beat) How’s that

TYLER
Marry me

ATHENA Oh Hell no
TYLER
So I’m guessing oral sex is out of

the question

Athena shoots Tyler a CONDESCENDING GLANCE

( )
72

TYLER
What I’m on a God damn suicide
mission

Tyler and Athena ARRIVE at the TRUCK now They GET IN and
DEPART but just as the truck is CROSSING over the drainage
DITCH the side DOOR slides OPEN and Tyler SOMERSAULTS out
tossing a SPOOL of WIRE ahead of him and ROLLING back down
INTO the ditch

INT REVEREND’S SWAT VAN NIGHT

The Reverend is SPEEDING down a STREET toward his CHURCH
CHASED by multiple SQUAD CARS

REVEREND
Alright brace yourselves

The Reverend PLOWS the truck right INTO his own CHURCH THRU
the front DOORS

it SKIDS into the CHAPEL PLOWING thru rows of PEWS before
grinding to a HALT right in FRONT of the PODIUM

Under a STORM of GUNFIRE the Reverend JUMPS OUT of the
truck with an empty soda BOTTLE in his hand

he RUNS to the HOLY WATER bath FILLS the BOTTLE with WATER
and JUMPS back into the truck

GARY
Why aren’t they coming in here Why
aren’t they attacking

REVEREND
This is hallowed ground Sanctuary
Evil cannot trespass here But

DRAINPIPES of VARIOUS sizes EMPTY into a large POOL of dingy
WATER ten feet by twenty feet and a MAIN DRAINAGE artery
about eight feet tall leads downstream from it all TYLER
EMERGES from ONE of the midsized PIPES WET and GRIMY now
WADING into the POOL of water It comes up to His waist He
has his DRAGONOV rifle and a large SPOOL of WIRE The water
is dark with muck and debris He LOOKS around at it with
DISGUST

He produces a now SOAKED MAP of the drain system He UNFOLDS
it and STUDIES it for a moment He CASTS it aside to DRIFT
away in the murky WATER and WADES toward ONE OF the drain
PIPES It has about three feet of space He SLINGS the SPOOL
and the RIFLE into the pipe then JUMPS up and SCRAMBLES
into it

A large room with cement walls and floor Many PIPES and
CONDUITS run in all directions There are SEVERAL small
OFFICES and outside the door to one of them is a large

CHRISTMAS

there is a MANHOLE COVER in the CONCRETE FLOOR It is HEAVED
aside slowly from beneath First the SPOOL then the RIFLE
are TOSSED out

Seconds later Tyler SCRAMBLES thru into the room and looks
around He pulls out of his hip pock a FOLDED set of SOGGY
BLUEPRINTS for the refinery He lays them on the floor
After STUDYING them for a BEAT or two he LOOKS upward and
EYES a large IRON PIPE running along the ceiling

Tyler PULLS off a small CHUNK from his Glob of SEMTEX
REACHES up and STICKS it to the PIPE He then takes a pair
of WIRE SNIPS out of his pocket HEADS BACK to the spool of
WIRE and starts UNRAVELING it

INT REFINERYGROUND LEVEL MINUTES LATER

TYLER has the SPOOL of wire and the SEMTEX in an another

Tyler CLIMBS up THRU the access TUBE into the NIGHT air He
is directly UNDER four GIANT propane storage TANKS

In the BACKGROUND SQUAD CARS and POLICE are visible They
have the place STAKED OUT But SOME of them do NOT look
HEALTHY now They seem to have DEVELOPED what look like
weeping LESIONS of some kind

Tyler STAYS DUCKED low and OUT of SIGHT as he PLANTS a
CHARGE on each of the TANKS and then SNEAKS back down the
service ladder

INT REFINERYBASEMENT LEVEL MINUTES LATER

Tyler HURRIES back to the MANHOLE through which he entered
with Athena’s TAZER in hand now but SOMETHING outside one
of the offices CATCHES his EYE it’s the TOY DRIVE DONATION
BIN at the top of its PILE of TOYS the TAIL END of a
SKATEBOARD can be seen

TYLER
(doing British accent) Lord love a
duck

Tyler RUNS over to the TOY BIN GRABS the SKATEBOARD and
RACES back to the MANHOLE

He gets HALFWAY DOWN the ladder into the STORM DRAIN
pauses and AIMS the TAZER at the NEAREST chunk of plastic
EXPLOSIVE on the fuel pipe

FOOTFALLS MANY of them POLICE POUR into the room GUNS
DRAWN but as they EMERGE from the shadows Tyler NOTICES
that they are physically NOT WELL They seem to be FALLING
APART With LESIONS and bleeding weeping WOUNDS Finally
an especially LARGE FAT uniformed COP (also looking sloppy
and bloody) LUMBERS into the room

Angle on his INSIGNIA it reads POLICE CHIEF BURTON

PARADISE FALLS Tyler cups his HANDS around his MOUTH and
SHOUTS

TYLER
Hey Kool-Aid (laughs) You wear

Abaddon I mean you guys really
look like shit

POLICE CHIEF
(Voice of Abaddon) Do you really
think destroying this refinery will
stop me We are Abaddon We have
been loosed from the bottomless
pit (in unison with the other
police) Abaddon is law

TYLER
(While pointing Tazer at explosive
charge) Yeah And laws were made to
be broken

Tyler FIRES THE TAZER at the CHARGE DROPS down into the
MANHOLE just as a huge EXPLOSION OBLITERATES the room

In the DRAIN PIPE now TYLER has just enough time to LIE
DOWN on his stomach and put the SKATEBOARD under him A
FIERY SHOCKWAVE from the blast BLOWS DOWN into the storm
drain

Tyler is PROPELLED AWAY from the blast on the SKATEBOARD
ROLLING thru the PIPE CLINGING TO the BOARD for dear life
He is SPIT OUT into the storm drain junction thru which he
entered He HITS the murky pool of WATER with a giant
SPLASH

INT CHURCH BASEMENT MOMENTS EARLIER

The REVEREND and the family of SIX SURVIVORS are in Tyler’s
BASEMENT ‘office’ They ALL wear BODY ARMOR now and are
well ARMED with various examples of Tyler’s merchandise The
Reverend has a SILENCER attached to his AK now He has a
pair of NIGHT VISION GOGGLES cocked up over his forehead

He OPENS the fake BOOKCASE REVEALING Tyler’s ESCAPE TUNNEL
To the tool shed

REVEREND
Ok this leads to a shed at the
edge of the property From there I
think I can take out a good half a
dozen of these guys before giving
away my position Then I’1l wire
the shed with a few of these (holds
up LASER TRIPWIRE device) and
hi-tail it back here (beat) You all
stay here while I head upstairs to
the bell-tower to pick off a few
more targets When I get back we’1l
discuss phase two of the operation

DAD GRABS an M5 carbine off the gun RACK

DAD
Put me in the bell tower with this
Well save time and we can draw
each other’s fire get more kills

REVEREND
Sounds like you know a thing or two
friend But I brought you all here
to escape the danger not expose
you to it This kind of thing takes
combat training

DAD
I was army Sixty first airborne I
was in Panama for Noriega

REVEREND
Is that so

DAD
Eight confirmed kills

REVEREND

You might just double that score in
the next few minutes

( )

DAD
To protect my family I’d triple
it and triple it again If you
don’t mind my asking who trained
you

REVEREND
Paramilitary contractor I can’t
even tell you what I did for them
or where you can read the
de-classified documents in about
thirty six years

DAD
Kills

REVEREND
Too damned many

DAD
I see

The REVEREND looks PONDEROUS for a beat or two
his own distant MEMORIES and SOMETHING in them
easy to look at

REVEREND
(snaps out of it) I have night
vision I can see them in all their
hiding spots so I’ll take the
first shots Once I start to draw
their fire you can locate the
remaining targets by their muzzle
flashes And if they break cover
and storm the tool shed it will
bring them into the light

DAD
Solid plan friend

REVEREND
just get out of there before you
start drawing fire

MOM
Oh Jesus Gary be careful

DADGARY

INT TOOLSHED NIGHT

The TRAP DOOR in the FLOOR of the SHED slowly creaks OPEN
The Reverend crawls out into the shadows with his NIGHT
VISION goggles on and his AK cradled in one hand against
his shoulder

POV NIGHT VISION (INFRARED) The DARK interior of the
SHED comes to artificial life in pale SHADES of GREEN He
CREEPS to the shed’s tiny WINDOW and PEERS thru

There are NO SHADOWS in the Reverend’s new FIELD of VISION

Multiple POLICE HIDE throughout the NEIGHBORHOOD under the
cover of a DARKNESS now STRIPPED AWAY Some are behind
BUSHES TREES or VEHICLES

Others LIE on their stomachs with WEAPONS DRAWN WAITING for
targets to reveal themselves NOT KNOWING they are now
revealed AS targets themselves

The Reverend MOVES to the shed’s double DOORS and NUDGES
them OPEN just a crack He LIES on his stomach now and AIMS
his weapon thru the crack from this POV he has HALF a DOZEN
good SHOTS

With one silencer MUFFLED SHOT after ANOTHER he starts
PICKING OFF the glowing faceless TARGETS as they HIDE
EXT BELLTOWER NIGHT

GARY without the benefit of a night vision perspective
AIMS his RIFLE in the direction of UNSEEN VOICES Then at

Gary FIRES into them ANGLE on human TARGETS in the shadows
getting HIT COLLAPSING FIGURES begin to EMERGE from the
shadows RUSHING into the LIGHT of the church GROUNDS Gary
CHOOSES his SHOTS well and ALMOST every one he takes FELLS
an enemy FIGURE STORMING the tool SHED

As DEAD and WOUNDED targets ACCUMULATE on the church LAWN
we can SEE that they were in ROUGH SHAPE BEFORE wandering
into Gary’s sites POCKMARKED with ERUPTIONS and DECAY in
their flesh Much of their SKIN seems to have been PEELED or
MELTED away Some appear to have been BLEEDING from their
MOUTHS NOSES and EYES

Gary DROPS all but FOUR of his TARGETS who SURROUND the
tool SHED now ONE of them SHOOTS a TEAR GAS canister
through the window

INT TOOLSHED NIGHT CONTINUOUS

The CANISTER PUNCHES thru the window GLASS TRAILING smoky
VAPOR like a noxious comet

It ARCS down to the FLOOR where it TUMBLES thru an infrared

ONE of the COPS FELLED by the blast at the shed has
SURVIVED He WRITHES in apparent PAIN as he TRIES to SIT up

Gary FINISHES them OFF two shots two kills But THESE are
the SHOTS that GIVE AWAY his position

A SPATE of OS GUNSHOTS ONE of them CATCHES Gary in the

all over his upper BODY from the TREMBLING Once they
RECOGNIZE the REVEREND MOM and the KIDS LOWER their

CUT TO

INT STORM DRAIN

From Tyler’s (shaky) NIGHT VISION POV as he crawls through a
narrow three foot storm drain with several inches of vapid
water running through it in the distance behind him
something RUMBLES something ROARS

Tyler LOOKS BACK Even with night vision he CAN’T SEE the
source of the noise The storm drain ANGLES OFF to the side
about a hundred feet back

But SOMETHING is CLAWING its way through the tunnel
PURSUING Tyler and CLOSING IN As the source of the
RUMBLING SCRATCHING and ROARING draws CLOSER it brings with
it the FLASHING of some electric LIGHT It appears as green
flashes of light thru the NIGHT VISION But as Tyler REMOVES
the LENSES and peers into the DARKNESS he sees the
REFLECTION of STATIC charges along the walls of the storm
drain

Worried tyler puts the GOGGLES back ON and INCREASES his
pace SCRAMBLING thru the drain

SILENCE for a beat or two and THEN

REVEREND WHERE’S TYLER

a MASSIVE and DEAFENING EXPLOSION on the horizon lights up
the night sky ATHENA POINTS to the suddenly GLOWING portion
of night SKY

ATHENA
That’s where Hope he made it He
had potential

REVEREND

ATHENA
Well he’s a crook He’s childish

bad news for all of us

ATHENA

stop us from doing that They got

have to be very close to that
explosion

REVEREND
How close

A SECOND smaller EXPLOSION belches SMOKE into the SKY and
BRIGHTENS the orange GLOW from the flames

ATHENA
Very

REVEREND
How will we know if he made it

ATHENA
Look for him at the courthouse He
planned to follow a storm drain
there (beat) If he made it

ONE of the felled POLICEMEN on the lawn is NOT DEAD He
GROANS quietly for a moment DROOLING BLOOD from both
corners of his mouth

at the HEAVENS now with OPEN resting EYES Athena’s FACE
betrays NO SADNESS but a single TEAR rolls down her cheek
now

The Reverend STANDS behind her now and places a HAND on her

SHOULDER He seems to understand that no words could comfort
her now After a long silence

EXT FRONT OF COURTHOUSENIGHT

On a SIDEWALK in front of the COURTHOUSE (and the FOUNTAIN
of DEATH) a MANHOLE cover is HEAVED aside and TYLER
SCRAMBLES out with his PLASMA RIFLE in hand

Whatever has been pursuing Tyler thru the storm drains is
not far behind we hear it RUMBLING and ROARING thru the
open storm drain

He SURVEYS his surroundings AIMING the RIFLE as he does
He’s SEARCHING for something and seems to FIND what he’s
LOOKING for

an UNMARKED SQUAD CAR parked in front of the courthouse He
SHOULDERS the plasma RIFLE by its strap and WALKS over to
the CAR

As he WALKS he PULLS a small vinyl POUCH from his POCKET
and UNFOLDS it ANGLE on the POUCH it’s a LOCK PICKING SET
with small metal PINS of varying lengths He removes TWO PINS
and begins PICKING the LOCK on the driver’s side DOOR of the
CAR

A STATIC CHARGE LEAPS from inside the manhole BRANCHING OUT
to make contact with numerous CONDUCTIVE OBJECTS cars
power lines parking meters trees The sounds of ZAPPING
POPPING and GLASS BREAKING as the FINGERS of LIGHTNING seem
to DRAW POWER from everything they touch FEEDING it to the
unseen THING GROWLING an CLAWING it’s way out of the manhole

TYLER
Knights of Columbus what now

A CREATURE EMERGES from the manhole CLAWS FIRST As it
SCRAMBLES and CLAWS its way out of the hole it REVEALS
itself to be something about the SIZE of a MAN BATHING in a
small OCEAN of electrical CURRENT and HARD to SEE in
detail

As it GETS to its FEET we can see that it is a HULKING
muscular form with MANY twisted HORNS COVERING it’s head and
body These horns seem to be acting as LIGHTNING RODS
drawing BOLTS of CURRENT from EVERYTHING around it

As it WALKS toward Tyler the CURRENT its DRAWING causes it
to GROW in size and as it does its FOOTSTEPS get HEAVIER

Several CAR ALARMS are SET OFF

( )
86

An EXPLOSION of SPARKS LEAPS from a TRANSFORMER on a power
line as its CURRENT is DRAINED by the beast One by one
FINGERS of CURRENT CONNECT the BEAST to the CARS whose
ALARMS have been TRIPPED As it DRAWS POWER from them the
SOUNDS of ALARMS and SIRENS FALTER WAVER and FADE

TYLER
(scared) you can stop growing any
time now

Tyler HOLDS his RIFLE steady at the beast It’s standing
twenty feet away now and it’s GROWN to a height of TEN
FEET We can see its eyes as two white hot points of light
It let’s out a piercing SCREECH as bolts of static radiate
from it zapping everything around it An electrified
mini-van’s WINDOWS EXPLODE SHOWERING the sidewalk and
street with GLASS

TYLER
Abaddon Angel of the bottomless
prick

abaddon’s MOUTH OPENS to SPEAK appearing as an amorphous
growing CAVITY of BLACK amidst a sea of hot BLUE It’s VOICE
is that of the POSSESSED cops that of the DEMONIC dispatch
voice

ABADDON
Human What is that weapon you
hold

TYLER

What this This is the titanium
dildo in a sandpaper condom that
you’re about to get fucked with

ABADDON
Foolish of you To think that any
earthly weapon could destroy me

TYLER
Let’s see about that shall we

Tyler OPENS UP on Abaddon with the plasma RIFLE The weapon
makes a SCREAMING SOUND as a wavering STREAM of blinding
white-hot ENERGY issues from the gun Abaddon is BURNED by
the plasma he ROARS IN PROTEST as he takes a STAGGERING
step BACK

TYLER
Oh yeah that’s doin somethin’ for
ya

( )
87

Abaddon CLUTCHES his ARMS against his CHEST TUCKS his HEAD
down and as he does a MASSIVE CURRENT of hot blue energy
BUILDS and EXPANDS from his form

LIGHTNING BOLTS leap from him in Tyler’s direction SEARING
the atmosphere leaving THUNDER in their wake The CAR Tyler
was trying to break into and an adjacent PARKING METER are
both ZAPPED

The car’s WINDOWS EXPLODE The meter DETONATES sending COINS
and shards of GLASS flying everywhere like SCHRAPNEL Tyler
is PELTED with COINS METAL and GLASS and HOLDS his free
ARM up to SHIELD himself from the barrage

Tyler RUNS for the COVER of a MINI-VAN He DUCKS around
BEHIND the back of the VAN and MEETS Abaddon in the street
with another SCREAMING WAVE of PLASMA THIS one RIPS across
his LEGS bringing him to BOTH KNEES with an asphalt
shattering THUD

Tyler LEVELS the WEAPON for another shot but NOTICES a
SWITCH on the SIDE of the weapon ONE end of the SWITCH is
LABELED ‘STREAM’ the OTHER end is labeled PULSE

TYLER
Hello what’s this

He FLIPS the SWITCH from ‘STREAM’ to ‘PULSE’ He PULLS the
TRIGGER and a SINGLE huge BURST of PLASMA ESCAPES from the
weapon with a BRIEF (but LOUDER) mechanical SCREAM It
STRIKES Abaddon right in the CENTER mass KNOCKING him flat
on his BACK

The impact leaves him CRADLED amidst a jagged spider web of
CRACKS in the asphault Abaddon SITS UP as fingers of
ELECTRITY CONTINUE to RADIATE from him Tyler hits him with
THREE MORE PULSES OF PLASMA

Abadddon is KNOCKED onto his BACK again

A WHINING noise comes from the GUN now its pitch steadily
INCREASING TYLER DROPS the GUN suddenly CURSING and WAVING
his HANDS in the air in apparent PAIN as if he TOUCHED a
hot STOVE

Tyler LOOKS down at the WEAPON it LIES on its side with a
CURL of SMOKE RISING from the BARREL There is a TEMPERATURE
GUAGE on the side of the weapon The NEEDLE is well in the
RED ZONE and steadily RISING fast approaching 200 degrees

TYLER BOLTS across the room and INTO the LAST STALL

He

HANGS the plasma RIFLE from the COAT HOOK on the stall DOOR

He STEPS onto the back-well of

the TOILET

He MOVES a CEILING TILE aside from its frame in the DROP

behind him

Seconds later ANOTHER PANEL is removed from above

and

Tyler’s ARM REACHES down GRABS the plasma rifle by it

ABSORBS the shots the WOUNDS quickly HEAL over

Abaddon’s ARM PUNCHES thru a ceiling PANEL to his left
Tyler ROLLS OFF the support BEAM he was clinging to and
PLUNGES THRU the DROP CEILING before he can REACH the

ONE ARM By His OTHER arm he HOLDS the (still smoking)
plasma RIFLE by the STRAP

INT JUDGE’S CHAMBERS

PLAQUES and CERTIFICATES ADORN one end of the room a large
FISH TANK atop a low BOOKSHELF is alive with a COLORFUL
assortment of tropical FISH

Tyler DANGLES over a desk LITTERED with PAPERWORK MAIL and
a desktop COMPUTER

A tremendous IMPACT on the OTHER SIDE of the WALL with the
plaques and certificates sends most of them CLATTERING to
the FLOOR

ANOTHER impact KNOCKS sheetrock OUT of the WALLS leaving
CRACKS and FISSURES thru-out

TYLER KICKS out a ceiling PANEL and SWINGS the plasma RIFLE
up into it as a third IMPACT brings Abaddon’s FIST THRU the
wall

GRABBING the support BEAM with his OTHER hand now Tyler
HEAVES himself back UP into the drop ceiling JUST AS
Abaddon’s fist OPENS and a WEB of electric CURRENT SPREADS
thru-out the room

One of the BOLTS ZAPS the AQUARIUM SHATTERING the glass

BOILING the water inside and sending WATER and FISH POURING
to the carpet below

Tyler SCRAMBLES onto his new SUPPORT BEAM The plasma RIFLE

TYLER
(whispers excited) Daddy’s home

Tyler SLINGS the RIFLE across his back and SCURRIES across
the support BEAM until he comes to a RAISED PORTION of the
ceiling five feet higher than the one he’s on

One of ABADDON’S FISTS SMASHES thru the drop ceiling to
Tyler’s LEFT and ANOTHER to his RIGHT

Tyler LEVELS the GUN at the three foot WALL ahead and FIRES
off a SINGLE SCREAMING PULSE of PLASMA It BLASTS a huge
HOLE in the wall the EDGES of which are CHARRED and
SMOULDERING

INT COURTROOM

LYING on his stomach and LOCKING his FEET around the
support BEAM Tyler LEANS his upper body DOWN over the edge
of the hole and into a COURTROOM the DOORS and some of the
surrounding WALL have been TORN AWAY marking the demon’s
entrance and are DRIPPING with Abaddon’s electric BLUE
BLOOD the liquid still GLOWS and SPARKS with electric
CURRENT

Tyler LOCATES Abaddon He’s PULLING his ARMS out of the
CEILING He’s TURNING around TYLER AIMS the rifle

TYLER
Hey plus size

Tyler SQUEEZES OFF a single PULSE of PLASMA NAILING Abaddon
dead in the FACE leaving a scorched oozing CRATER LEAKING
a viscous BLUE LIQUID

TYLER
Smell me now motherfucker

Tyler PULLS himself BACK into the drop CEILING He CLIMBS up
the RISE in the ceiling SCURRIES across the top and DOWN
the other SIDE He BACKS UP a good five feet and SHOOTS a
second HOLE in the rise

He CRAWLS to the EDGE and PEERS over He’s at the OTHER SIDE
of the COURTROOM now and within jumping DISTANCE of the
judges BENCH

ABADDON is already LUMBERING in Tyler’s direction KICKING
aside and CRUSHING rows of wooden SEATING as he comes

INT COURTROOM

Tyler SQUATS STRAPS the RIFLE over his back and JUMPS from
the HOLE in the wall to the BENCH He UN-SHOULDERS and AIMS
his weapon With TWO SHOTS he KNOCKS the demon on it’s BACK
with a resounding THUD

TYLER
(as he jumps down off the
bench) Well How do you like
this Ironic that we should
end up in a courtroom what
with all that ‘Abaddon is law’
shit ‘’cuz the jury’s back
And the jury says your law can
eat a bag of dicks

Abaddon gets to his feet WOUNDED but HEALING already
drawing CURRENTS of POWER from numerous points in the walls
and ceiling

the LIGHTS in the courthouse BLINK and BROWNOUT for a moment
TYLER HITS Abaddon in the CENTER mass with HALF a DOZEN
pulses of PLASMA a final pulse BLOWS his right LEG off the
the knee

ELECTRIC BLUE Blood POURS from Abaddon’s SMOKING CRATERED
BODY and the STUMP that used to be his leg

Abaddon FALLS to the left SMASHING wooden ROWS of SEATING
to SPLINTERS beneath him He’s BEHIND a row of SEATS now
Only his remaining LEG is still VISIBLE

It TWITCHES for a moment then CEASES

The WHINING NOISE comes from the plasma RIFLE again Its
PITCH RISING more QUICKLY this time

TYLER DROPS it as it OVERHEATS He looks at its TEMPERATURE
GUAGE as it LIES on the FLOOR It’s well into the RED ZONE
RACING past 200f Tyler GRABS the GUN by the STRAP

TYLER
Looks like we can’t be friends
anymore

He FLINGS it into the MIDDLE of the COURTROOM where Abaddon
LIES Tyler BARELY has TIME to SCRAMBLE behind the judge’s

BENCH before the unstable prototype EXPLODES in a BLINDING
SCREAMING FLASH that leaves SMOKE and FIRE in it’s wake

The SMOKE CLEARS and the DESTRUCTION comes into FOCUS the
drop CEILING is OBLITERATED The remaining FURNITURE and

SEATING has been BLOWN BACK to the four WALLS Patches of
FIRE have taken root throughout the room The wooden FENCING
SEPARATING the seating AREA from the FOREFRONT of the
courtroom SMOLDERS The defense and prosecution TABLES are
OVERTURNED

TYLER EMERGES from UNDER the judge’s BENCH and SURVEYS the
smoky AFTERMATH

He APPROACHES Abaddon DRAWING and AIMING both 50 cal
Automatics as he goes The creature’s CONDITION is REVEALED
to be a SHREDDED unrecognizable HEAP Motionless SMOKING
LYING at the center of a POOL of SLIMY BLUE electrified
FLUID

TYLER
That’s right Jack with my hometown
and see what happens to you Silly
fucking rabbit See what happens to
you

STANDING over the BODY now Tyler REACTS to what SEEMS to be
a terrible SMELL

SILENCE for a moment as TYLER STARES down at Abaddon and
then

BUZZING and CRACKLING noises from ALL DIRECTIONS FINGERS of
static CURRENT LEAP thru CLOUDS of SMOKE from UNSEEN CORNERS
of the room

The BOLTS CONVERGE on the BODY of ABADDDON Abaddon is
REGENERATING Healing slowly as the ELECTRICITY COLLIDES
with his body which seems to ABSORB it ABADDON’S massive
form is HEALING GROWING NEW LIMBS SPROUT from the STUMPS
that used to be the old ones

TYLER BACKS AWAY slowly

TYLER
Well this bodes an ill wind

The LAST of Abaddon’s WOUNDS SHRINK out of existence EVIL
LAUGHTER quiet at first EMANATES from him

He STANDS UP REVEALING that he is LARGER now Even with the
drop ceiling GONE he has to HUNCH OVER in here

Abaddon’s LAUGHTER BUILDS to a crescendo

He RAISES his ARM at TYLER it’s covered with twisted horns
and claws each one buzzes and snaps with electric current

( )

Tyler DRAWS BOTH 50 cal AUTOMATICS hits him with

ABADDON
(Amidst sinister laughter)
f-r-e-e-z-e

TYLER
Why Nobody freezes where you come
from

ABADDON
Before I destroy you I want you to
understand exactly what I am

TYLER
You’re a colossal Fuckasaurus Rex

ABADDON
Demons are not immortal human We
live long but not forever

TYLER
Fascinating Really

ABADDON
We are not born like you We
explode like stars And in the end
we collapse like stars My
collapse is imminent I feel it
even now But it is now that I burn
hottest (beat) Hell wants your
souls I don’t care where your
souls go I only want to rip them
from your bodies now before I am
ripped from existence

TYLER
Gee now And you would have gotten
away with it if it weren’t for us
meddling kids Oh and PS you’re
a whore

ABADDON
Defiant human Join me and my
rewards for you would be
immeasurable

TYLER
Not even for a Scooby snack bitch

scatter

Blue liquid leaks from the wounds but they quickly heal
Tyler turns to run Abaddon roars and raises both arms from
ALL the HORNS CLAWS and TEETH on his body come BOLTS of
CURRENT zapping him all at once

ANGLE on TYLER as he is being ELECTROCUTED the bolts of
current CEASE as OS FOOTFALLS and GUNSHOTS are heard
TYLER ROLLS onto his BACK SHAKING and TWITCHING He is
badly BURNED and SMOKING

Angle on the COURTROOM ENTRANCE POLICE uniformed and
plain-clothed alike are GATHERING at the ENTRANCE They are
FIRING off a HAIL of BULLETS and SHOTGUN BLASTS But one by
one their AMMO RUNS OUT the LAST of the SHOTS are fired

Abaddon takes HEAVY FIRE but he is already REGENERATING as
near SILENCE RETURNS to the room FOOTFALLS Someone RUNNING
out in the HALLWAY APPROACHING at high SPEED

REVEREND (0S)
Stand aside I have what this thing
needs

The POLICE MOVE aside as the REVEREND RUSHES in HOLDING a
loaded SUPER-SOAKER

He CLOSES IN on Abaddon HOLDING the toy gun PRONE It’s a
SQUIRT-GUN sure but the Reverend’s LOOK and STANCE makes
it CLEAR he MEANS BUSINESS

REVEREND
(to Abaddon) a little heated
brother let’s cool you down

The Reverend SQUIRTS a stream of HOLY WATER onto Abaddon
The water BURNS INTO him

Abaddon HOWLS in honest to God PAIN SMOKE pours from
abaddon The Reverend SPRAYS him AGAIN TEARING a GASH across
his MIDSECTION and CUTTING him in TWO

Abaddon OPENS his MOUTH as he DRAGS what’s LEFT of him
TOWARD Tyler Abaddon’s GUTS TRAIL behind him now but with
his ARMS and JAWS intact he can still RIP Tyler to SHREDS

Tyler GRABS the CRUCIFIX the Reverend gave him to WEAR
around his NECK and TEARS it off BREAKING its CHAIN Tyler
HOLDS it COCKED READY to THROW

TYLER
Have a Jagged Little Pill why don’t

Tyler HURLS the CRUCIFIX on its broken chain at ABADDON it
DISAPPEARS into Abaddon’s GAPING MOUTH as he comes to DEVOUR
Tyler

ABADDON CLOSES his mouth

SILENCE for a moment as Abaddon STARES at TYLER his FACE
frozen in a conglomeration of FEAR and SURPRISE

LESIONS surface across Abaddon’s BODY and CURLS of SMOKE
rise from them

Then FLAMES First in PATCHES but Abaddon soon becomes an
INFERNO he HOWLS as he BURNS DOWN to a smoldering HEAP

Angle on TYLER as he LIES on the FLOOR EXHAUSTED and
BURNED He STARES at(the remains of) Abaddon and Abaddon’s
dead face STARES BACK Tyler still LYING on his BACK in
obvious PAIN and still TWITCHING from all the juice LOOKS
up to see ATHENA and the REVEREND STANDING over him

ATHENA
you did it gun runner you made a
big boom and sure enough it got
the world’s attention the national
guard is here

REVEREND
(as he looks Tyler over) Just look
at you This is why I keep dragging
you to church Tyler so you don’t
wind up sporting the ‘extra crispy’
look for all eternity

The REVEREND and ATHENA HELP Tyler to his FEET HOLDING him
up by his ARMS now they START for the ENTRANCE to the
courtroom

The CROWD of surviving POLICE PARTS down the middle as the
three WALK thru In the HALLWAY now they WALK past GUTTED
WALLS and great smears of inky BLACK BLOOD as the
occasional PARAMEDIC or FIREFIGHTER RUSHES past SURVEYING
the damage and LOOKING for injured people

They make their way THRU the LOBBY and PAST the crushed
METAL DETECTOR(from WITHIN the WRECKAGE some bit of STILL
WORKING circuitry DETECTS metal on the THREE as they PASS
and EMITS a pathetic dying ‘BLEEP’ They DESCEND the front
STEPS of the COURTHOUSE SIDESTEPPING the bloody HUMAN
WRECKAGE from the FOUNTAIN of death

A SLEW of MILLITARY VEHICLES are PARKED all up and down the

and CIVILIANS are CRAMMED into the SWAT TRUCK as it CRUISES
thru the shadowed COUNTRYSIDE

The Reverend DRIVES while Tyler RIDES SHOTGUN ATHENA is in
the BACK TALKING with several of the surviving POLICE The
REVEREND GLANCES at ATHENA in the rear view MIRROR

REVEREND
(to Tyler) I think she kind of
likes you y’know

TYLER
Who likes me

REVEREND
(points over his shoulder) You know
who

Tyler LOOKS over his SHOULDER His EYES come to rest on
ATHENA and LINGER there for a moment

Then he SNAPS OUT of it and with an AWKWARD LOOK TURNS to
face forward again

TYLER
Oh please I think she plans to
arrest me the first chance she

gets

REVEREND
No she won’t No one’s arresting
anyone

TYLER

She won’t even call me by my name
It’s all gunrunner this and
gunrunner that

REVEREND
I think she’ll be good for you

TYLER
Don’t go playing matchmaker padre
Stick to preaching and kickin’
demon ass

( )

SILENCE for a moment And THEN

Another SILENCE BROKEN by ATHENA

TYLER
Rev

REVEREND
Yes Ty

TYLER

Do you really think we got rid of
Abaddon Did we really make a
difference tonight

REVEREND
Revelations says that in the last
days he will be loosed from his
bottomless pit to run amok then
returned to it (beat) we know now
his ‘bottomless pit’ is a radio
frequency a wavelength Did we
really send him back there I don’t
know But I will tell you this his
very appearance marks the arrival
of the last days And if we didn’t
send him back - if someone picks up
his frequency again then this is
only the beginning of the end

TYLER
Armageddon The end of the world
in our lifetimes You really
believe that’s possible

REVEREND
The God I know is with me Tyler
And anything is possible That is
what I believe

as she POKES her head in

BETWEEN the two She LOOKS as if she has something to SAY

but HESITATES looks DISTRACTED almost worried Tyler GLANCES

over at her seems TONGUE-TIED for a moment then turns to
FACE FORWARD again

TYLER
What’s on your mind

ATHENA
(defensive) Hey gunr

She HESITATES When she SPEAKS again
GONE

the defensive TONE is

( )

ATHENA
Hey Tyler

TYLER
Yeah

ATHENA

Me and some of the guys have been
talking We have to go to the FBI
If Abaddon still is on the airwaves
he’s a threat And I’m sure we’re
off PandORA’s Christmas card list
now FBI’s all we got left And the
worst thing we could do is wait for
them to come looking for us

REVEREND
She’s right Ty

TYLER
Demonic possession That’s a tough
sell I mean what would you say to
that

ATHENA
It’s the truth They can polygraph
us It’s all we got

TYLER
Nearest FBI office is Kansas City
right

REVEREND
I believe so

TYLER
Kansas City it is I’m still not
sure how we’re going to sell this
to the feds

ATHENA
If he’s still out there still on
the airwaves I got a feeling we
won’t have to
