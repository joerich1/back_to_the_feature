shaken like paint cans-- its too loud to speak Each flask
is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered
to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS Whitacre watches He
focuses on one worker-- shes ASIAN She adds some nutrients
to the feed line

WHITACRE (VO)

A positive mental attitude is a
real important thing Theyve done
studies where heart patients who
have people praying for them

was Homecoming Queen then Either would be hard pressed to
envision a life without each other

GINGER
Youre not hungry Corky
Whitacre is distracted Ginger cuts up Alexanders food

WHITACRE (V0)

The pilgrims loved the corn-- they

came for the religious freedom but

they stayed for the corn-- but its

missing three of your eight

essential amino acids-- especially

lysine Thats why the Indians ate

it with beans or lime You feed a

chicken corn and it gets sick Yo

feed it corn and lysine and it goes

from egg to supermarket fryer in

six months instead of eight

Whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken and then at
his wife She has gotten dressed up for dinner She looks
pretty

WHITACRE (VO)
Breasts and thighs in six months

WHITACRE
You look great

GINGER
They got the first wall of the

WHITACRE (VO)

killers in a hotel room than jump

definitely Lie down in a great
big hotel bed-Whats that place

Sixth grade Marty Blocker used to

9 INTERIOR MICK ANDREAS OFFICE ADM- MORNING 9

At 630 the next morning Whitacre walks across the ADM
trading floor and straight into Mick Andreas office looking
flustered

WHITACRE
Mick youre not going to believe
what the hells happened I think
I know the reason why weve been
having all these problems at the
plant

ANDREAS
Well Ive only been asking you to
come up with one for the past eight
weeks Im all ears
Whitacre paces His story comes out in a rush of words
Andreas listens silently

WHITACRE
Its not start-up problems like we
thought Its the Japanese This
guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto hes
been calling me-- sometimes at
work sometimes at home cuz of the
time difference-- you met him he
was here a couple of weeks ago

(MORE )

Draft 11503 9

WHITACRE (CONTD)

Well last night he calls me at home
just after 8 and Mick he knew
everything He says to me “You
remember the total nightmare you
had during May June and July
And before I can ask him what he
means he says “Those months when
ADM was losing about seven million
dollars a month in the lysine
business
Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the
company should know that Andreas is still stone faced

WHITACRE
I couldnt believe it But Mick
before I can even ask him how he
got those numbers he starts making
little comments about us having
microbe problems Jokes like hes
toying with me
Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high

WHITACRE
And then he tells me that one of
our highest paid employees is
actually an employee of Ajinomoto
and is sabotaging the plant
Theyre injecting some kind of
virus into the dextrose and
contaminating the whole deal
Thats the problem Ill tell you
Mick its like Rising Sun that
Crichton book its just like it
Fujiwara even said that his boss
keda would have him killed if he
new he was calling So I asked
him why he was talking to me and he
said-- he said-- he wants 10
million dollars 10 million and
hell tell us who the saboteur is
and give us a new lysine bug thats
immune to the virus We could be
up and running in three days
Andreas pauses takes it all in and then

ANDREAS
How well do you know this guy

WHITACRE
Uh um well I met him a few weeks
ago when he came over And then
he called a couple of times

ANDREAS
So not very well
Draft 11503 10
R

WHITACRE
Very well No I cant really say
that
Andreas ponders the situation

ANDREAS
Okay if you hear from him again--
talk him down on the price I want
you to find out the least amount of
money hed settle for If we can
get a bug thats resistant to the
virus it might be worth itBut
I want you to keep this quiet if
there is a mole we dont want him
to know were onto him

10 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- EVENING 10

Whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light looking
at the foundation for the NEW HORSE STABLES being built
across the road from the main house There is not another
home anywhere nearby

WHITACRE (V0)

R
Thisd be a great place for some
outlet stores People would come
from all over Southern Illinois and
probably Missouri too Famous
name brand labels and appliances at
savings of up to fifty per cent
every day Maybe a food court with
a Mexican place After the
stables maybe a tennis court or a
little pitch and putt by the pool--
that adds to resale value like
nobodys business
Whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street
light

WHITACRE (VO)

The birds eat the bugs the cars

eat the birds the rust eats the

cars and the new construction eats

the rust

SHEPARD
You want to go back inside

WHITACRE
I think they might have it bugged
Were safer out here
Shepard is confused

SHEPARD
Bugged What
Whitacre takes a moment-- but decides to go on

WHITACRE
This used to be Dwayne Andreas
house you know that

SHEPARD
Im aware of that

WHITACRE
There are things I know but if I
decide to tell you whats going on
could I be prosecuted for it
Draft 11503 24

SHEPARD
I cant provide you with immunity
but any information you tell me
about your involvement in criminal
activity would be discussed with
the US attorneys office ina
favorable light
Whitacre stares forward-- a beat Shepard gets out his
notebook

WHITACRE
Everything I told you yesterday
about Fujiwara was true-- except
one thing I never received a call
from him on the office line
Shepard looks at Whitacre-- hes confused

SHEPARD
Why did you tell me that you did

WHITACRE
Before I spoke with you Mick
Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached
me on what to say They told me to
tell you that the calls came in on
my business line instead of my
home line

SHEPARD
Why
Whitacre pauses again Its too late to turn back

WHITACRE
What Im about to tell you involves
something very large This
extortion attempt by Fujiwara is
nothing compared to it
Shepard says nothing

WHITACRE (CONTD)
It involves price fixing in the
lysine business Ive been in
several meetings with our Japanese

and Korean competitors in the past

few months where the sole purpose

has been to fix prices ADM made me

go to these meetings

Shepard writes furiously struggling to see in the dark

Draft 11503 25

WHITACRE
Thats why they wanted me to lie
Fujiwaras calling on my home line
But so are the people we fix
prices with They didnt want you
to hear those conversations so they
told me to say the Fujiwara calls
came in on the ADM line But I
knew if you guys ever started
looking at the records youd see
all these calls I have to Japan
And thats what scared me Nobody
has more calls than me If you ever
figured out about the price fixing
Id be the fall guy
Shepard considers the explanation

SHEPARD
Who told you to participate in
these price fixing talks
Whitacre pauses summons his conviction

WHITACRE
Im operating under the direction
of Mick and Dwayne Andreas

WHITACRE

R-

WHITACRE
Theyre afraid of what you guys
might find out Can you give me a
tape recorder I can prove this if

Shepard is out of pages in his notebook

SHEPARD
I want to thank you for being
honest with me tonight

WHITACRE
Youre not going to ask questions
at ADM about all this Itd be my
job for sure

SHEPARD
No what was said here was
confidential Im going to speak
to my superiors Mark and then
well be in touch
Whitacre goes back inside his dark house and heads upstairs-—
he seems unburdened

WHITACRE (V0)

He seems like a real good guyI
mean just a straight shooter I
think we really got along-- I bet
he wouldnt mind if I called him
Brian instead of Agent Shepard
Bri Hey Bri This must be
very different for him Talking to
a guy like me instead of a bank
robber or a drug dealer

ANGLE ON SHEPARD
Struggling to read his notes in the car

WHITACRE (V0)

I could see us fishing or whatever

Thats not true Not true I just

word It gets a bit heated

CHEVIRON
Come on the phone company doesnt
call people and say “hello just

WHITACRE
Then why would Regina say that

CHEVIRON
She didnt say it youre saying
it

Chevirons tone becomes condescending-- like hes talking to
a sick person

CHEVIRON
Fine Mark I will
Whitacre storms out

Whitacre stares out through the glass walls drinking a COKE
Mick Andreas and Cheviron are making a bee-line for him

WHITACRE (V0)

(off the Coke Can)

It doesnt taste the same-- when
Dwayne Andreas got the government
to subsidize corn farmers-- it all
changed Corn syrup got to be
cheaper than sugar-- so they went
with the high fructose corn syrup
from ADM They said you couldnt
tell the difference but thats
just a lie-Like when they

replaced butter with topping at the
movies and you know who was
behind that

Draft 11503 32
Mick Andreas and Cheviron march into Whitacres office on a
mission

ANDREAS
Weve decided that were not going

Cheviron

WHITACRE
I knew it I knew it I knew we
should never have done this I
told you but you wouldnt listen
They said just the office line
Cheviron has to eat shit here in front of Andreas

CHEVIRON
Evidently they were lying to us

restaurant than anything that might have once involved
agriculture Outside RUSTY the gardener fishes leaves from
the pool Shepard explains the misunderstanding with the
phones

PAISLEY
The only listening device was the
recorder Mark

SHEPARD
We had a trap and trace device on
the home line-- but we cant listen
in with that

PAISLEY
However the phone company calling
people and telling them about our
Intel gathering is well our face
is red on that one

SHEPARD

Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork

Mark I gotta ask you why are you

afraid of that But now youre
telling us all this other stuff out

The light disappears from Whitacres eyes

WHITACRE

Things are going on I dont approve
of I mean Im a biochemist-- But

38 INTERIOR WHITACRES BARN- CONTINUOUS

WHITACRE
When they told me to lie I had to

lie I lied to you guys and I feel

real bad about it

This explains the bind Whitacre finds himself in

SHEPARD

You look at yourself as wearing a
white hat and theyre wearing black
hats

WHITACRE

Thats a good way to put it You
know when I was a kid my folks
died in an automobile accident I
was maybe six at the time and this
wealthy man in Ohio adopted me He
owned amusement parks and he did
real well for himself real well I
got a big break-- went to a good
school and all-- I adopted two kids
of my own I just want to do the
right thing

PAISLEY
Well Mark do you think youd be
willing to go a few steps further
in helping us

WHITACRE
What do you mean

SHEPARD
Would you be willing to wear a
wire We dont have any other
sources at this time We need your
help
Whitacre considers the request-- a chance to be a hero

Draft 11503 36

PAISLEY
Now you realize that by doing this
sometime down the line you could
be the guy who has to testify
against your fellow executives
people youve worked with now for
years That wont be easy
He looks around at the good life Whitacre has amassed

SHEPARD
Ill use my beeper to signal you
when its time to set up a meeting
Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button- BEEEEP

SHEPARD
When you hear this-- you call me
Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a
simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model He gives it to
Whitacre

PAISLEY

Youll be risking a lot

Whitacre picks up the recorder The idea of being a White
Knight only becomes real when they hand you a sword

of itself And some people still
dont believe in God I mean what
more proof do you need than that--
Herndon and Shepard re-enter

WHITACRE
Hey howd I do

SHEPARD

WHITACRE
Wait a minute I watched the

SHEPARD
Mark you dont know how to read a
polygraph

WHITACRE

Herndon plays the bad cop

HERNDON
Mark you splattered the walls with
ink Come on now extortionists

number then go away

Draft 11503 48

Whitacre nods-- his eyes water He sighs

SHEPARD (CONTD)
I know its tough keeping it all
bottled up inside keeping it a
secret But theres only one good
choice for you Thats all theres
ever been Theres something
youre hiding something youre
keeping from us But the only way
to protect yourself is to be
completely honest

WHITACRE
Okay
Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case Not a basic
302 this time-- its A CONFESSION

SHEPARD
You realize this document can be
used against you in a court of law
Whitacre nods grimly

HERNDON
What happened with Fujiwara and the
saboteur
A beat

WHITACRE

I made it up I had to
Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf The floodgates
open Shepard transcribes the confession

WHITACRE (CONTD)
-Weve had problems at the plant
with viruses were way behind
projections Dwayne was thinking
about shutting us down and everyone
was on me to fix it Lets just
blame it all on Whitacre Thats
how it is there It was my job they
were talking about We just moved
here from Europe-they made me VP

SHEPARD
And the reason you agreed to help
ADM purchase a new bug

Draft 11503 49

WHITACRE
I wanted to be part of the team I
thought it would help my
relationship with Mick if he
thought I would do something like

HERNDON

attitude

WHITACRE

During the part where youre just

Whitacre looks out the window at white billowing clouds

WHITACRE (V0)

When polar bears hunt they crouch
down by a hole in the ice and wait

one paw over their nose so that
they blend in Cuz theyve got
those black noses Theyd blend in
perfectly if not for the nose

Whitacre descends the steps of the jet followed by Andreas
and some other SUITS Whitacre peels off the group

WHITACRE
Im just gonna hit the head here

WHITACRE (V0)

So the question is How do they
know their noses are black From
looking at other polar bears Do
they see their reflections in the
water And think Id be invisible
if not for that That seems like

a lot of thinking for a bear

Theres something great about

walking into a conference room when
theres a pad of paper and a pencil
in front of every chair Most guys
with a science background dont get
to see what goes on

A UNIFORMED HOTEL WORKER arranges the orange juice coffee

croissants melon plate A pen and pad of paper is put in

front of every seat A FLIP CHART stands ready in the
corner

The meticulous worker makes everything perfect pausing for
a

moment to adjust A LAMP

Draft 11503 59

WHITACRE (V0)

Usually the hotels name is
embossed on the pencils and they
have someone who sharpens them to
perfect points like collie dog
noses-- thats what they remind me
of Maybe they come from the
factory that way And theres
always a plate of
danishdanishes-- an almond
thing-- or a cheese danish with a
big cherry blob in the middle
chest

61 INTERIOR MENS ROOM- CONTINUOUS 61
The AFRICAN AMERICAN AGENT finishes shaving Whitacres

He takes out a roll of surgical tape and attaches a small
NAGRA RECORDER to WHITACRE Small wires attach to switches

The almond thing makes a lot of
crumbs and I usually use my pencil
to sweep them away like one of
those tools professional waiters
use at the Decatur Club

You want to try it
Whitacre flips the pocket switch

Corporation each get two thousand
tons then we can divide up the

WHITACRE
And thats not all Id say that
ten of the products produced by ADM
are price fixed

SHEPARD

WHITACRE
I would estimate that for all the
companies involved the total extra
profit is in the range of 800
million to one billion dollars
Thats just from the price-fixing

SHEPARD
Can you tell us what products
Whitacre smiles-- hes got something else on his mind

WHITACRE
You know Brian if all these
companies are charged theyre
going to be paying an awful lot in
fines Dont you think

SHEPARD
I dont know they might end up
paying But nobody knows for sure
how this will turn out

HERNDON
We still need to get everyone
together making an actual agreement
before we have a case

WHITACRE
Sure sure I know that But Ive
taken a lot of risks and I need to
think about my family

SHEPARD
What do you mean

fine ADM was ordered to pay me ten
years salary

me to put out a story theyre not
going to confirm It would be
crazy

AUBREY DANIEL (0S)

Hello Mark Its Aubrey Daniel

I think you forgot something

Whitacre pulls over onto the shoulder He looks at the cell
phone in dismay and stares at a Polaroid of himself from the
Fortune Magazine photo shoot-- hes smiling in the picture

WHITACRE (V0)

One of the things Ive learned in
business is that you should always
use a persons name in conversation
if you want them to feel
important Sid Hulse and Marty
Allison think that and theyre very
successful salesman

143 EXTERIOR CHINESE RESTAURANT TAYLORVILLE- DAY 143
Whitacre gets out of an FBI cruiser with Herndon and Shepard
and the three men walk toward the restaurant in rural
Illinois

WHITACRE (V0)

It makes people feel like theyre

definitely being told something

they can use

They enter and the HOSTESS gives them a table up front

WHITACRE
You got anything open in the back

WHITACRE (V0)

Just by putting their name in there
at the beginning or the end

The men sit at a table in the back
A beat

WHITACRE
Brian Bob my attorneys telling
me not to say anything but theres
something Ive wanted to talk about
for awhile

HERNDON
Dont tell us anything You have an
attorney now This isnt like
before Lets just talk
Shepard tries to change the subject

Draft 11503 118
SHEPARD
You been playing any golf

Whitacre doesnt want to just talk

WHITACRE
They want to talk to me at ADM

HERNDON
Mark you understand your lawyer
has advised you not to discuss this
matter

SHEPARD
Were not asking you

WHITACRE
Let me throw out some
hypotheticals Ill talk about
some financial situations and you
tell me if theyre wrong or how
serious they might be OK For
instance suppose a company gave an
executive a car you know a
corporate car But instead of
driving it to work he drove his
personal car and gave the company
car to his daughter Would that be
a problem

HERNDON
Thats it Thats the hypothetical
The agents try not to laugh After what Whitacre has given
the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing

SHEPARD
That shouldnt be a problem

WHITACRE
What about if an executive used a
corporate plane for personal use

HERNDON
Basically its the same thing

SHEPARD
There may be some IRS issues but

WHITACRE
What if hypothetically the
activity involved kickbacks by
corporate executives

Draft 11503 119
I

HERNDON
There are plenty of ways companies
try and attract business Dinners
for clients tickets for sporting
events

SHEPARD
Its not ethical but its done
A beat Then Whitacre goes on

WHITACRE
Uh is this conversation on or off
the record

SHEPARD
On Definitely
Whitacre exhales

WHITACRE
What if the company regularly
accepted kickbacks to executives in
the form of cash
Shepard drops his fork Hold on Shepard

SHEPARD
How much money are we talking about
Mark
Whitacre pauses clears his throat

WHITACRE
Five hundred thousand

HERNDON
How much
Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just
crapped on the rug

WHITACRE
Its how things were done there

SHEPARD
When did this start Mark

WHITACRE
December of 1991
Shepard cant believe it

SHEPARD
You You And how were you paid
Draft 11503 120
E

WHITACRE
By check They were deposited in
various accounts And always under
10000 dollars

SHEPARD
And did any of these checks come in
after we met
Whitacre pauses

WHITACRE
Maybe a couple
The agents try and control their anger

SHEPARD
Who else knows about this

WHITACRE
Nobody
Herndon loses it

HERNDON
Come on Mark-- you just said its
how things were done at ADM Now
is there anything else youre
involved in Anything else you need
to tell us

WHITACRE
Just what I told you

HERNDON
Im asking you one more time

WHITACRE
The 500 and thats it Definitely
Whitacre nods He asks hopefully

WHITACRE
This isnt going to affect the
price-fixing case is it
The three men get up to leave

WHITACRE (V0)

I feel good about that Hey I
dont see what the big deal is
They said help us with the price
fixing and I did-- the two things
are totally unrelated

Aubrey Daniel and a cadre of CORPORATE ATTORNEYS sit at a
conference table with Mann Mutchnik and US ASST ATTORNEY
GENERAL GARY SPRATLING An overhead projector displays the
forged contracts on the wall

WHITACRE (V0)

When you look at what went on with
all the price fixing they did or
the Federal Building being bombed
in Oklahoma City why are we
focusing on me getting a half-
million in kick-backs along with
everyone else

AUBREY DANIEL
Two point five million dollars
Deposited in a bank in Switzerland
while Mark Whitacre was on ADM
business We have sworn testimony
from Mr Lennart Thorstensson of
the ABP Corporation that hes never
seen this contract before and that

his signature has been forged He

and his company never received this

check

As Daniel speaks one of the younger lawyers passes out a
folder of affidavits and other documents supporting his
claims

AUBREY DANIEL
It is clear to us that Mark
Whitacre driven by his own
boundless ambition to take over
ADM has attempted to frame his
superiors in a price fixing
conspiracy of his own invention so
that he could seize control of the
company

Draft 11503 122
Mann and Mutchnik cant believe what theyre seeing in the
black folders

AUBREY DANIEL

His cooperation with the government
is merely a smokescreen for his
lying and stealing We have
additional information that we are
prepared to share with Attorney
General Reno that the money has
been moved to an account in Grand
Cayman with the full knowledge and
complicity of Whitacres FBI
partners

And under

of their careers

They need to dig deep then theyll
find out how high it goes-- its

theyll see

Draft 11503 123

SHEPARD
What are they accusing me of
I want the specifics Are they
saying Im in cahoots with the guy
Medford and Paisley dont want to answer this

MEDFORD
Paragraph eight in our agreement
with Whitacre states that his
actions are directly attributable
to the FBI and the US

SHEPARD
But how could we know what he was
doing He came to us

PAISLEY
The question theyre asking isnt
“how could we know Its ‘why
didnt we know
HERNDON
The question is ‘were they fixing
prices
Medford and Paisley share a look

MEDFORD
The investigation has shifted from
ADM to Whitacre

SHEPARD

Of course ADM decides Whitacres a
thief as soon as they find out hes
working for us

HERNDON

Whos counting the money over there
if they can just lose 25 Million
dollars for a few years and then
find it in a few hours

SHEPARD
We gotta call Mark

PAISLEY
I dont want you doing that
Shepard and Herndon are confused

MEDFORD
Were taking you off

Zaideman and Epstein shake their heads

Epstein tries to do some damage control

EPSTEIN

I know the frauds I committed are

Whitacre before-- hes thrown

HERBST
This might help your memory
He slides the forged ABP documents toward Whitacre

WHITACRE

These are ADM records showing the

forging of signatures

Whitacre smiles and shakes his head He sees the conspiracy
plainly

much

WHITACRE (VO)

I read this study in Time magazine
when I was at Cornell-- which is an
Ivy league school-- and there were
a lot of people who never believed
including my mother that I would
make it to an Ivy league school
maybe just Ginger who I met in
Marching Band in the 8th grade

ANGLE ON THE LETTER

Fragments of the contents This is to inform you of your
lithium levelsExacerbated by stressA strict drug

WHITACRE (V0)

-and the study said that people

had nice sympathetic feelings

bout people who were adopted and
reated them better So I made up
his adoption story-- and people

id treat me better-- and when I

ot a job one of my professors told
he people at Ralston Purina that I
as this amazing guy that had
ccomplished all of this in spite

f being adopted--

recorder to another-- trying to piece together an
incriminating tape to frame Shepard

WHITACRE (V0)

Grandiosity and embellishment--—
what they call it when you
embellish things-- those are the
major symptoms of bipolar disorder
And the other the second major
symptom is poor judgement And
thats something Brian Shepard
should have known The bipolar
disorder is what made me believe
Id be President when it was
over Although there was a time
when Mick told me on a trip to
Nebraska that I could be headed
for the top

Case 97-2001 United states of

JUDGE BAKER
You have the right to make a
statement if you wish
Whitacre nods and stands

WHITACRE
I appreciate the opportunity to say
a few words its been a long five
years I apologize to a lot of
people in this room

ANGLE ON SHEPARD AND HERNDON
They sit together in the back row

WHITACRE
And to a lot of them who are not in
this room for my actions I
realize I hurt a lot of people and
I apologize greatlyI am here to
accept my punishment Thats all

JUDGE BAKER
To observe that Mr Whitacre is the
usual felon is a gross
understatement He is well
educated has a loving wife and
family is respected in the
community It is not inconceivable
that in due course he may have
become CEO of Archer Daniels
Midland

ANGLE ON WHITACRE

He smiles He knew he could be CEO someday We hear
Whitacre in a calmer time

Draft 11503 151

WHITACRE (V0)
I like jail I think its been good
for me
But the judge isnt done with him

JUDGE BAKER
However the court can find no
clear connection between Mr
Whitacres bipolar disorder and the
45 counts of criminal misconduct he
has been charged with-- just garden
variety greed It is very
difficult to tell when Mr Whitacre
is telling the truth

188 INTERIOR ANOTHER COURTROOM- DAY 188

five years

WHITACRE (CONTD)
Id also like to take this
opportunity to apologize to Special
Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of
myself and my wife Ginger he never
hit me with a brief case or told me
to destroy tapes The idea to sue
him wasnt mine-- it came from
someone at ADM and I shouldnt have
listened I cant remember who
when I was at ADM I lived so many
lives I wasnt sure who I was
Today I know more who I am and
what I really want out of life
Ive completed three post-graduate
degrees while in detention A JD
which is of course a law degree
and another advanced degree in the
psychology of jury selection I
sleep better in prison than I have
in years My wife has forgiven me
and believes that the ordeal with
ADM has brought us closer together
in a marriage of over 20 years I
hope you will allow me to leave
here so that I can re-join my life
with my family and three kids Two
of whom are adopted Especially
when you consider that thanks in
large part to my testimony the US
government has been able to collect
over a billion dollars in price-
fixing fines from big business
Thats it Thanks
