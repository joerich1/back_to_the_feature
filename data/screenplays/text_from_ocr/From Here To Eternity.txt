Prewitt I always make it a policy
to talk to my new men Its
important for an officer and his
men to understand each other Now I
have a fine smooth-running outfit

ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with
unholy glee

HOLMES
Plenty of room for advancement for
a man who knows how to soldier But
hes got to show me hes got it on
the ball I dont know what youve
been used to in the Bugle Corps
but in my outfit we run it by the
book What kind of trouble were you
in over there
PREW
No trouble sir

HOLMES
What made you transfer out then

PREW
Its a personal matter air

HOLMES
Oh I see

He studies Prew for a moment sees Warden on the edge of his
chair watching hawk-like

HOLMES
Something you wanted to ask
Sergeant

WARDEN

(explodes suddenly)
Who Me Whv yes air You had
Corprals stripes in the Bugle
Corps Prewitt You took a bust to
buck Private to transfer to an
Infantry Compny Why Because you
like to hike

PREW
I dint have no trouble if thats
what you mean

WARDED
(grins suddenly)
Or was it just because you couldnt
stand to bugle

PREW
It was a personal matter

WARDEN
Thats up to the Compny Commanders
discretion to decide

PREW
(looks straight at Warden)
All right I was First Bugler at
Shafter for two years The topkick
had a friend who transferred in
from the states Next day he made
him First Bugler over me
WARDEN
And you asked out on account of
that
PREY
Maybe I just aint sensible But
thats the reason
WARDEN
(snorts)

His feelings were hurt Kids they
send us now

Warden swings his chair around absorbs himself in work at
his desk as if the Prew situation is too absurd to concern
himself with Holmes speaks blandly winningly

HOLMES
Ive got a mighty sour Company
Bugler here but I suppose you

wouldnt want that job

PREY
No air
HOLMES
(smiles)

Well well get your stripes back
for you maybe an extra one for
good measure You know why you were
sent over here when you requested
transfer

PREW
No sir

HOLDS
I pulled a few strings Im the
Regimental Boxing Coach Prewitt I
saw your fight with Connors in the
Bowl year before last With any
luck you should have won it I
thought for a while in the second
round you were going to knock him
out

PREW

CLOSE SHOT PREW

Prews lips are drawn tight He nods almost imperceptibly

MEDIUM SHOT

During this shot Maggio can be seen in bg through door to

Orderly Room He pretends to be sweeping but stops

then to listen

HOLMES

Yes its too bad about that I can
understand how you feel But those

things happen in this game A man

when he fights

PREW

Thats why I decided I would quit

HOLMES

HOLMES (cont d)

it this way What if all fighters
felt like that

PREW
They dont

HOLMES
Would you have us disband our
fighting program because one man
got hurt

PREW
No sir I dint say --

HOLMES
You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed Our
fighting program is the best morale
builder we have off here away from
home

PREW
I dont want it disbanded sir
(doggedly)
But I dont see why any man should
fight unless he wants to

HOLMES
It looks to me like youre trying
to acquire a reputation as a lone
wolf Prewitt You should know that
in the Army its not the individual
that counts If a man wants to get
ahead he has certain
responsibilities to fulfill that go
beyond the regulations It might
look as though I were a free agent
but Im not Nobody is

Holmes waits hopefully for a moment then realizes Prew is
not going to respond further He stands Prew snaps to
attention

HOLMES

Maybe youll change your mind In
the meantime just dont make any
mistakes in my outfit

(to Warden)

basket filled with papers on the floor In a moment the
sound of the screen door slamming is heard Warden picks up
the papers

werent here to swab out his throat

to hurt bitterness anger Over shots we occasionally hear

food to get their nourishment

chuckles from Prew and Lorene os then silence for several
moments CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low intimate
laughs then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch

feeling A door leading to another room is half open in bg
A door leading to a hall is closed Prews arm is around
Lorenes shoulder he is very relaxed regards her with
something like wonder Lorene is mellower too making no
effort now to be the Princess She speaks as if resuming a
conversation

waitress He was from the richest

There is a sound at the door and they turn towards it

MEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL

as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through its
hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle After a moment
Maggios head follows the arm through the door He is
grinning like an amateur conspirator

MAGGIO

LORENE

(to Prew) )
Do you

PREW
No I dont like weakness
(vises takes a drink)

(snuggles to Prew)
Well its so

MAGGIO

He drops down on the divan beside her

PREW
Its a personal thing

His dread of telling the tale crumbles before his
overwhelming need to tell it to have someone understand

PREW
Over at Port Shafter I used to
fight Middleweight I was pretty
good I used to work out with Dixie
Wells He was a light-heavy but he
was fast And good He loved
boxing He was gonna come out of
the Army and go right into the
upper brackets People on the
Outside had their eye on him

(rises paces)

Dixie didnt want to use the six
ounce gloves this time And we
neither of us wore headgear
anyway I was set flat on my feet
when I caught Dixie wide with this
no more than ordinary solid cross
Dixie just happened to be standing
solid too

(MORE )

PREW(contd)

(sits on chair)
From the way he fell I knew Dead
weight square on his face He dint
roll over He was in a coma a week
Then he finally came out of it The
only thing was that he was blind

(rises paces)
I went up to the hospital to see
him Twice Then I couldnt go
back We got to talking about
fighting the second time And Dixie
cried Seein tears comin out of
those eyes that couldnt see

There are tears on Prews face He turns away from Lorene

MEDIUM SHOT NEAR SHORE

A wave sweeps by camera Karen and Warden riding it into
shore CAMERA PANS with them as they walk out of the water
hand in hand They stop at edge as if by a mutual impulse
He swings her to him and kisses her

CLOSEUP

as they kiss The embrace is impassioned When their lips
separate their arms remain around each other holding tight
to something they find is more than sex alone

EXTREME CLOSEUP
as Karen and Warden kiss again a tenderness in him not seen
before and which he normally takes great pains to hide

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
as their lips separate again

KAREN
Nobody ever kissed me that way
not really

They are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to
the kisses The jump to banter is a quick defense

WARDEN
Nobody

CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they walk to the fire Karen smiles
at him

KAREN
No Nobody

WARDEN
Not even one Out of all the many
men youve been kissed by

KAREN
Well that will take some figuring
How many men do you think there’ve
been

CAMERA HOLDS as they sit beside the fire Karen wraps one of
the blankets around her

WARDEN
I wouldnt know Cant you even
make me a rough estimate

KAREN
Not without an adding machine Do
you have your adding machine with
you

WARDEN
No I forgot to bring it

KAREN
Then I guess you wont find out
will you

WARDEN
Maybe I already know

The defense has given way and there is no mirth in the
questions and answers now

KAREN
Whats the matter What are you
hinting at

WARDEN
Why Is there something to hint at

KAREN
I dont know Maybe a lot Or maybe
you just think theres a lot

WARDEN
Maybe I do Maybe theres been a
long line of beach parties --

KAREN
You must be crazy --

WARDEN
Am I Listen baby maybe not here
But what about when you and Holmes
were at Fort Bliss

Karen flings off the blankets snatches her dress stands up
raging She speaks as she pulls the dress over her head
wriggles into it

KAREN
I had to go and forget you were a
man -- with the same rotten filthy

mind the rest of them have For a
minute I had to convince myself you
were different --

WARDEN
Only its true aint it

KAREN
Yes its true A part of it some
small part of whatever sewage
youve been listening to Some day
perhaps youll get all the story

WARDEN

(yaps up)
All what story

KAREN
Youre getting to sound so much
like a typical male So you just
sweat it out like a typical male

She starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach walking
fast then almost running Warden runs after her

MEDIUM SHOT BEACH NEAR PATH UP ROCKS

as Warden catches up with Karen He grasps her arm roughly
hauls her down onto the sand He stares at her bitterly
waiting f or her to speak

KAREN
All right Ive never told it to
anyone before But I think now is
the time Ill tell you the whole
bloody messy thing You can take it
back to the barracks with you

She speaks rapidly pouring it out in bursts For much of the
story her face is in shadow as if a cloud is passing across
the moon

KAREN

Id been married to Captain Dana E
Holmes two years Only he was a
First Lieutenant then Back at Fort
Bliss We lived right on a little
lake where we could fish and swim
and be alone our ‘dream
cottage’ Im sure you must be
able to picture it It was off ona
back road four miles from the
highway Two miles from a neighbor
and a telephone

(pauses then rushes on)
I hadnt been married long when
I knew my husband was stepping
out on me But -- you get used
to that Your mother tells you
that its life that i t happens
to a lot of women Of course
she doesnt tell you until after
it happens

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
reacting with fury toward Holmes compassion for Karen

KAREN
Then by that time youre
pregnant And at least youve
something else to hope for I think
I was almost happy that night the
pains began Even though they were
weeks too early a whole month too
early I remember Dana was putting
on that dapper silk gabardine
uniform he used to wear He was
going to an officers seminar He
was kidding me about false labor I
didnt think it was humorous I
told him to get home early to
bring the doctor with him He
smiled tenderly and told me about
the psychic reactions of women to
pregnancy But never fear hed be
back early And maybe he would
have if the seminar hadnt
been with the hat-check girl in one
of the night clubs

WARDEN
Listen
TWO SHOT
KAREN
He was only a little drunk when he
came in at five am He looked

alarmed when he saw me I guess it
was because of my screams I was
lying there on the floor you see --
No dont say anything Im not
finished yet Of course the baby
was dead It was a boy But they
worked over me at the hospital and
fixed me up fine They even took my
appendix out too They threw that
in free It was all fine

WARDEN
Listen Listen Please

KAREN
And of course one more thing no
more children Do you know what
that means Youre not a woman
Youre not anything Youre a
gutted shell Sure I went out
with some of the men after that A
few months of it Id been made
dirty and I wanted to be clean You
can see that cant you Anyway
I got my revenge on Dana I kept on
living with him

WARDEN
The hateful miserable --

KAREN
You hunt so hungrily for love
love if you can find it you
think might give things meaning
again

WARDEN
Listens Listen to me --

KAREN
All right Im listening

Warden shakes his head inarticulate with his rage and love
Karen moves closer to him

KAREN
I know Until I met you I didnt
think it was possible either

plays throughout the sequence
TWO SHOT
as Alma comes over to Prew

PREW
I mean it I need you

ALMA
(as before)

PREW
(recklessly)
A thirty-year man is movin all
over goin all the time Up to now
I never thought a thirty-year man
had any business to think of gettin
married

She stares at him amazed a touch angry

ALMA
Youre a funny one little Prew
boy

PREW

(hurt)
Yeah Must be the altitude

ALMA
A very funny one that I cannot
figure out

PREW
Whys it funny if a guy wants to
marry you

ALMA
Because Im a girl you met at the
New Congress Club And thats about
two steps up from the pavement

PREW
Okay -- Im a private no class
dogface soljer And the way most
civilians look at it thats two
steps up from no thin

There is a silence Alma is honestly distraught

ALMA
Oh Prew Prew I thought we were
happy Why do you want to spoil
things
PREW

Lissen I aint think in of now
But I got a plan cookin in my head
You want to go back to the States
in a year Well you could stretch
it some make it two years And I
could swing a Sergeants stripes --
If I were a non-com the Army’d let
me pick my duty when I re-enlist

(lost in the picture of

it)
And theres some posts back in the
States -- like Jefferson Barracks --
The married noncoms rate solid
brick houses with lawns with new-
cut grass and walks with big old
oak trees

ALMA
Now I know youve lost your mind
How do you expect to become a
Sergeant under this Captain Holmes
of yours Its all you can do to
keep out of the Stockade

CLOSE SHOT PREW

TWO SHOT

PREW
I could fight

PREW
It I go out for boxin hed send me
to non-com school The Regimental
Championship is next month I bet I
could win the middleweight even
without training I used to be
pretty good I could do it

Alma is deeply moved She speaks gravely sincerely not
all immodestly

ALMA
No I dont think you should give
in to The Treatment even to
marry me

PREW

This’d be worth it

at

ALMA
(almost desperately)

Prew -- its true we love each
other now But back in America it
might be different We might not
even want each other

PREW
Okay But that aint the real
reason

ALMA

All right Its not

PREW
Whats the real reason you wont
marry me

ALMA
I wont marry you because I dont
want to be the wife of a soldier

PREW
Well thats the top I could ever
do for you --

ALMA
Because nobodys going to stop
me from my plan Nobody Nothing
Because want to be proper

PREW
Proper

ALMA

(impassioned)
Yes proper Respectable Secure
In a year Ill have enough money
saved Im going back to my home
town in Oregon and Im going to
build a new home for my mother and
myself and join the country club
and take up golf And then I1l
meet the proper man with the
proper position And Ill be a
proper wife who can keep a proper
home and raise proper children And
I will be happy because when you
are proper you are safe

PREW
(bitterly disappointed but
admiring)

(MORE)

PREW(contd)

You got guts Alma I hope you pull
it off

The victrola record ends Alma turns away from Prew and goes
to the victrola Now that shots had her say with such
certainty she deflates Except for the fact that she looks
like a girl who never cries she looks as if she might cry
She lifts the record off the turntable

ALMA
But I do mean it when I say I need
you Because Im lonely Sometimes
Im dreadfully lonely You think
Im lying dont you

PREW
No Nobody ever lies about being
lonely

Alma puts the same record on again Prew looks out over the
beautiful view

of petulance anger and frustration He doesnt touch his
food but occasionally takes a sip of coffee

KAREN
Im afraid Im not going to tell

HOLMES
You cant keep a thing like this
hiddenand

KAREN
Im not going to hide anything Im
just not going to tell you

She applies herself to her food anxious to drop the matter

HOLMES
One thing I know I know its a
civilian Youd be too discreet to
pick an Army man

KAREN
I dont think its any of your
business who he is

HOLMES
It is my business Im your
husband What do you think a
scandal would do to my chances for
a promotion So if youre thinking
of a divorce you can forget it

Karen stiffens She struggles to maintain her self-
possession She manages it keeps outwardly calm through the
scene

HOLMES
Now -- how does it feel to know
youll have to live with a horror
like me the rest of your life

KAREN
Not very nice But then theres the
compensation of knowing youll have
to live with me the rest of your
life

Her attitude makes Holmes progressively sorrier for himself
CAMERA MOVES with him as during following he rises goes to
stove pours himself another cup of coffee He spills a
little and the liquid sizzles on the burner

HOLMES
You dont know how a man feels
about a thing like this It breaks
aman all up -- inside

KAREN
(dryly)
I gander why men feel so
differently about it than women

HOLMES
Its -- its just not the same

CAMERA MOVES with him as he returns to the table decides to
try another tack

HOLMES
Why do you think Ive done all I
have

KAREN

Done all what

HOLMES
Tried to be a Company Commander
when I hate it worked my fool head
off with this miserable boxing
squad tagged after the General
whenever I could

KAREN
I dont know Why

HOLMES
Why for you and for me For our
home thats why

KAREN
(dryly)
I always thought you did it because
you wanted to get ahead

She finishes the last of her food stands

KAREN
Its a lovely day out I think I’1l
go for a walk

Holmes catches her wrist stops her

HOLDS
I’m willing to forgive you Tell me
who he is Make a clean breast of
it And Ill forgive you

KAREN
I wonder which is hurt more -- your
pride or your curiosity

She disengages her wrist
KAREN
(coolly)
When Im ready to ask you for a
divorce we can discuss it again

She goes to door to pantry pauses there

KAREN
(maternally)
And do eat your breakfast Dana

INT GENERALS OFFICE - DAY

MEDIUM SHOT GENERAL SLATER COLONEL WILLIAMS HOLMES

The American flag the Generals flag and the Division flag
are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office
Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report

COLONEL WILLIAMS
--- In addition to inefficiency
in administering his command and
neglect of duty Captain Holmes has
been guilty of indefensible cruelty
to the aforesaid Private Prewitt
This extended to instigating and
encouraging wholly unauthorized and
discreditable tactics to force the
soldier to join the inter-regiment
boxing team These findings are the
result of personal investigation by
the Inspector General and are
corroborated by numerous members of
G Company

Colonel Williams puts his report on the Generals desk
Holmes’ face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he
has really expected something like this for a long time He
makes no move to speak The General is angry clear through

GENERAL SLATER
Im waiting for your reply to this

HOLMES
I havent any sir The charges --
are true

GENERAL SLATER
Holmes the first thing I ever
learned in the Army was that an
officer takes care of his men It
seems to be the first thing you
forgot Its monstrous to think of
anybody like you in command of
troops And believe me you wont
be for long My only regret is that
we have to keep you in uniform
until a court martial is concluded

(MORE)

GENERAL SLATER(cont d)

In the meantime of course Im
relieving you of your present
duties

He indicates the meeting is over Holmes rises is about to
leave pauses

HOLMES
If there were any way to avoid a
court martial sir Any way

The General frowns is unresponsive Holmes looks to Colonel
Williams helplessly

COLONEL WILLIAMS
There is one alternative
General if youre so disposed A
resignation for the good of the
service under AR 600-275

GENERAL SLATER
(thinks a moment)

Ill give you a chance you dont
deserve Holmes Write a letter of
resignation and have it on my desk
this afternoon I’11l consider
accepting it Only because as far
as Im concerned the quicker
youre out of the Army the better
for everybody Especially the Army

head emotionally bewildered For perhaps the first time in
his life he is nakedly honest

HOLMES
Where has it gone Karen What
happened to it The gay cheerful
life we were going to have you and

The scream of the planes drowns Dhom’s voice There is a
tremendous clatter as the men fire The Jap planes pass
untouched

From this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there
is a wild cacophony of Jap planes BARs Karelsen’s machine
gun the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance And
Chief Choate singing the Regimental marching song loudly
and lustily

ANOTHER ANGLE

respond with tremendous spirit they are having one hell of a
time We get only a snatch of what Warden is yelling

WARDEN

There are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the
glass doors The radio is on volume low and an announcer
(not the one of the morning) is droning out an account of
Pearl Harbor Prew still on the couch in his pajamas looks
as if he has just struggled to wakefulness He listens to the
radio for a few moments in confused disbelief He shakes his
head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess He shakes
his head again slowly more knowingly now nodding as if he
remembers something from the broadcast of the morning Then
as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he
wrenches himself off the couch He looks around at the dimly
lit room

opposite direction from the jeep which passed before It is
also manned by three MPs There is a startled cry from Prew

Prew starts to run back across the road A white spotlight
flashes on its harsh brilliant light following him Prew
slips to one knee

the appearance of a terrified animal There is a wildness a
senselessness about him The blotch of blood oozes and
