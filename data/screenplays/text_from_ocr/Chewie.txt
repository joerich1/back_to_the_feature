The following is a work of fiction but any similarity to people
living or dead is probably because it’s completely true
INT DEATH STAR - DETENTION SECURITY AREA - NIGHT

Two STORMTROOPERS escort a handcuffed CHEWBACCA into the gray
detention area

A tall grim-looking OFFICER approaches the trio

OFFICER
Where are you taking this thing
STORMTOOPER
Prisoner transfer from cell block

OFFICER
I wasnt notified Ill have to
clear it

The officer gestures to a GUARD clad in all black The guard
approaches Chewbacca

Without anyone firing a weapon SPARKS and SMOKE begin to
abruptly shoot from the walls and consoles

The guard turns around breaking character

GUARD
Wait I thought I was supposed to

CHEWBACCA
(with a human voice)
Ah

Chewbacca swings his arm wildly knocking the guard on the
back of the head sending him tumbling to the ground

LUCAS
Okay let’s cut there

GEORGE LUCAS with brown hair a full beard and dark
tortoiseshell rimmed glasses stands and enters the action

A dozen assorted crew members swarm the set make
adjustments and restage the scene

Chewbacca removes his costume head revealing PETER MAYHEW the seven-foot-two British man portraying the Wookiee
Timid with a soft monotone voice Peter is nearly the polar
opposite of the character he plays

He reaches down and helps up the guard he knocked over

PETER
Very sorry about that
GUARD
All in a day’s work

PETER
I’m still having trouble seeing
You know with the mask on I’1l

try to be more careful next time
Peter turns and looks directly at us the audience

PETER (CONT’D)

(directly to the camera)
One of the first things you learn
when you’re really tall is that
you have to be careful always You
can’t take many risks or you’re
likely to end up crushing
something or someone

The camera follows Peter as he ambles over to the craft
services table

PETER (CONT’D)
Of course none of you really care
about me not yet anyway You want
to hear about Star Wars Well the
good news is this movie is about
that movie I’m going to tell you
everything even the stuff they
don’t want me to

Peter reaches the craft services table and pours some tea

PETER (CONT’D)
The bad news is that this movie’s
also about me a bit too And why
shouldn’t it be I’m the one it’s
named after or at least Chewbacca
is Look don’t worry I’m not
going to introduce you to my grade
school teacher or any rubbish like
that It’s just--

He pauses and takes a sip of tea

PETER (CONTD)
Star Wars was the biggest risk I
ever took It may seem obvious now
but it certainly didn’t seem that
way at the time Not to anyone Not
even to you know who

Lucas completely unaware of Peter’s conversation with the
audience interrupts him
LUCAS
Alright Peter we need you for the
close up

Peter stops looking at the camera and becomes a little less
poised now back to his awkward self

PETER
Oh Right I was just um I’m
sorry

Peter puts the Chewbacca mask back on

A CAMERA ASSISTANT with shaggy hair bell bottoms and giant
yellow ear muffs holds up a CLAP BOARD that reads

“The Star Wars”
Slate 406 Take 2
19th MAY ‘76

He positions the board in front of Chewbacca’s face and claps
it

TITLE OVER
Los Angeles Two Years Earlier

Lucas sits on one side of a gargantuan conference room table
Across from him several executives including ALAN LADD JR Fox’s VP of Creative Affairs

Sitting silently next to Lucas is GARY KURTZ Lucas’s
producing partner who sports an Abe Lincoln beard

EXECUTIVE 1
Can we back up for a second The
laser swords and the laser guns
Are those the same

LUCAS
No the laser gun is a normal
everyday laser gun The laser sword
is different It’s the ancient
weapon of the Jedi Bendu

EXECUTIVE 1
Got it And Anakin Starkiller
fights Jedi Bendu
LUCAS
No Anakin Starkiller is a Jedi
Bendu He and the other Bendu fight
the evil Sith Lords

EXECUTIVE 2
Wait Bendu’s not a person

LUCAS
No

Puzzled looks on the executives’ faces

EXECUTIVE 2
So who is this Starkiller Are we
thinking a Robert Redford type a
Dustin Hoffman a Charlie Grodin--

LUCAS

(exhausted by the

question)
It needs to be all unknowns If
Robert Redford is in the movie all
of the sudden it becomes a Robert
Redford movie I want it to bea
space movie

Alan Ladd lets out a deep sigh

ALAN LADD
George I have faith in you That’s
why you’re here but maybe this
isn’t the right project

KURTZ
What you have to realize about
George is he’s got a real vision
He’s very visual that’s why this
will work You guys have seen

Grafitti

EXECUTIVE 1
That was great but this isn’t
like that

EXECUTIVE 2
Why not just do a sequel to
Graffiti

LUCAS
I want to do something completely
new This is the kind of movie I’ve
wanted to make since I was a kid
KURTZ
That’s why kids are gonna love it

EXECUTIVE 3
For this budget we could make ten
kids movies

LUCAS
Not this kind of movie I want to
take people to a new place I
remember watching the Flash Gordon
serials when I was young and there
is nothing like that any more

EXECUTIVE 2
We should just get the rights to
Flash Gordon

LUCAS
No this is better because now it
can be something different I know
it’s a risk but all of Hollywood
is a risk

MR STANFILL
When I was at Lehman Brothers we
had a policy

Everyone turns to DENNIS STANFILL a Tennessee Native
veteran of the Navy and Fox’s Chairman of the Board

MR STANFILL (CONTD)
We only made investments if we were
completely confident in their
returns

Lucas and Kurtz look apprehensive Alan tenses up

MR STANFILL (CONTD)
Now I’1ll defer to you Alan since
this is your area of expertise but
it just seems to me that this is
far from a sure thing

KURTZ
(whispered)
Show them the stuff now

LUCAS
I could explain the story again--

KURTZ
No just show them
Lucas fumbles with a leather briefcase

LUCAS
(turning back to the
executives )
I had an artist do some conceptuals
to kind of give an idea what it
could look like I think these
really--

Lucas displays beautiful full color paintings that show
elaborate images of Star Wars as we know it

EXECUTIVE 1
Oh fuck

The X-Wing TIE-Fighter battle inside the Death Star trenches
Darth Vader wielding a lightsabre

A hairy giant creature with a bandolier across his chest and
a gun in his hand Chewbacca

ALAN LADD
Those are really something

Lucas looks at Kurtz optimistically

KURTZ
Is that a yes

Ladd glances at Stanfill who gives him an “I trust you but
it’s your ass on the line” look

ALAN LADD
(cautiously)
It’s a yes

Peter lifts up Graham’s legs and pulls out the bedpan Graham
looks away toward the ground He sees Peter’s giant black

shoes

GRAHAM
I’ve worked in the shoe department

I’ve never seen a pair that big

PETER
They actually They actually
wrote an article about them in the
Examiner

GRAHAM
An article about your shoes

PETER
No an article about my feet

GRAHAM
Piss off

PETER
(shyly)
It’s not much of an accomplishment
I was just born this way

Peter grabs a fresh bedpan from the cart
PETER (CONT’D)
I need to get back in there

He lifts Graham’s legs again
PETER (CONT’D)

I did get to be in a movie because
of that article though

GRAHAM
That’s fantastic

PETER
It was okay I played a Minotaur
One of those Sinbad movies never

FRED
It was a compliment He said no big

HARRISON
(scoffing)

Harrison lightly taps a nail into place

FRED
I know but you know how George is
He thinks everyone has memorized
every frame of Graffiti like he
has

HARRISON
So what the hell are you doing
here
FRED
I think if we’re clever he can be
convinced

HARRISON
Forget it If he doesn’t want me I
don’t want him I’m getting too old
to be begging for my supper I’1l
just make another fucking cabinet

Harrison turns the chair on its side to look at it

FRED
This is your problem Your
attitude You never go all in on
anything

HARRISON
I don’t need a lecture

FRED
You’re right your life’s perfect
I don’t know why I even bothered

Harrison looks up at him

HARRISON
Alright What did you have in
mind

FRED
I assume you can install a door

Harrison nods

Well what if you were fixing one
when George came into the office

HARRISON
That’s the plan

FRED
That’s it

You really think I’m that
desperate

Lucas doodles on the white space of two Polaroid photos one
of Harrison Ford and another of Christopher Walken

Kurtz hangs up the phone

KURTZ
Ladd says no this is the contract
take it or leave it

LUCAS
Well I always said if we didn’t
get guaranteed distribution I’d
walk

KURTZ
What are you saying

LUCAS
I’m saying maybe I should actually
do that

KURTZ
You’re really saying that

LUCAS
I don’t know How are we still
negotiating this We’re almost done
casting

Lucas picks up the Polaroid of Walken

LUCAS (CONTD)
Can we bring Walken back in to read
again I’m not sold on him but
there’s something I like about how
he talks

KURTZ
Should I set something up or is the
movie off because you don’t like
the contract

Lucas starts to tug on the hair above his sideburns

LUCAS

I’ve done three page-one rewrites
for free the shooting schedule’s
basically impossible--

(he tugs harder on his

hair )
I’m gonna kill myself doing this
and we’re not even sure the movie
will get a real release

KURTZ
Yeah That’s where we are

LUCAS
AGHH

Lucas picks up a pair of scissors and cuts a chunk of hair
off

KURTZ
I hate it when you do that

Lucas takes a breath

KURTZ (CONTD)
Look Pollock and Berg have gotten
things from Fox that no one thought
was possible You’re gonna be able
to make the movie you want to

LUCAS

But is it going to be worth it
KURTZ

Honestly at this point I have no

idea

Lucas brings the scissors back to his hair and then thinks
better of it He tosses them on the desk

LUCAS
Alright I’1ll sign it

Kurtz hands Lucas his pen

KURTZ
They did say one other thing
They’re moving the start date
again

LUCAS
They already pushed it back twice

Youve always said that

live on hopes and dreams

Harrison sits down and she takes his hand

MARY (CONT’D)
I know you’re not happy here

HARRISON
Will you stop with that stuff

MARY
Harry I know you The reason the
house isn’t finished isn’t because
you’re too busy - it’s because
you’re depressed

Harrison doesn’t respond She’s right

MARY (CONT’D)
If you want to be a carpenter I
will get behind that 100 But if
any part of you still wants to be
an actor you need to do this

Harrison kisses her on the forehead

As soon as I get back I’m gonna
finish the rest I promise

Freeborn and Mollo head toward Prowse

KENNY

PETER
They couldn’t do that Could

KENNY

Kenny lights a cigarette He offers one to Peter Peter looks
down at Kenny who’s literally half is size

PETER
No thank you
INT KINGS COLLEGE HOSPITAL - DAY

Peter is back in Graham’s room he finishes wiping his ass
GRAHAM
You know it may just be because
you wipe my bum but I feel like
you and I have a very intimate
relationship

PETER
(joking)
Probably because I wipe your bum

GRAHAM
Glad you cleared that up

Peter readjusts Graham’s gown but seems distracted

GRAHAM (CONTD)
Something on your mind besides
bedpans

PETER
Oh it’s nothing Just went to an
audition for a movie and things
started moving a lot faster than
I’m used to

GRAHAM
Sounds exciting

Peter starts to load up his cart

PETER
I’m not even sure if it’s worth
asking my boss for the time off
He’s not the most accommodating and
it seems like this might just make
him upset

GRAHAM
Peter take it from a man who’s
staring down the grim reaper

Graham begins to speak in a more serious tone

GRAHAM (CONTD)
It’s not the things you’ve done
that haunt you it’s the things you
were too afraid to do You don’t
think I wanted to work at Debenhams
my whole life do you

INT KINGS COLLEGE HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

Peter knocks on a door that says NURSING ADMINISTRATOR

MR WHITAKER (0S)
Come in

INT KINGS COLLEGE HOSPITAL - ADMINISTRATORS OFFICE - DAY

MR WHITAKER the grumpy nursing administrator sits
behind a drab steel desk Bookshelves full of colored binders
surround him

MR WHITAKER
Have a seat Mr Moviestar

Peter pulls the chair back further and sits down carefully

PETER
I didn’t know you had heard I was
going to speak to you about it
today I didn’t want to bother you
before I knew for sure

MR WHITAKER
So what You’re here to give your
two-week notice then

PETER
Well no I mean even though it’s a
movie I’m not being paid very much
and -- I’m not needed all the days
they’re shooting I was hoping we
could work out a flexible schedule

MR WHITAKER
Special treatment just for you
You must be out of your mind

PETER
It’s just -- I know you were able
to give Donald off during Rugby

season

MR WHITAKER
He was in the World Cup That’s a
bit different

Peter looks down

MR WHITAKER (CONTD)
When I was younger I wanted to be
on the radio Do you know where I’d
be now if I’d pursued that

PETER
I suppose you could be a big star
maybe

MR WHITAKER
No you dolt I’d be unemployed No
one listens to the bloody radio
anymore

Peter doesn’t know how to respond

MR WHITAKER (CONT’D)
Listen I can move your schedule
around for this but I need to be
sure that whatever dates we decide
on will be final I can’t keep
moving peoples’ schedules around

PETER
I’m not really sure--

MR WHITAKER
Well that’s the problem right
there You need to be So give me
the dates you need off now - and
then you’re off for them End of
discussion

PETER
Yes sir

Peter takes out a piece of paper from his pocket and writes
the dates on it Whitaker snatches it and gets back to work

PETER (CONT’D)
You know this movie is a very big
production That’s why some things
are still up in the air

MR WHITAKER
Things aren’t up in the air here
anymore are they

PETER
No sir I’m off those dates and
that’s final

EXT TUNISIAN DESERT - FARM SET - DAY

TITLE OVER
First Day of Shooting
March 22nd 1976
Tunisia

For the first time we see MARK HAMILL he’s as fresh
faced and young as we expect but also has an unexpected
arrogance about him He’s overacting three times as much as
his performance in the final film

MARK
But I was going into Tosche
Station To pick up some power
converters -- Can we stop I’m
sorry George I just don’t get it
Can you explain the converters

We pull out and see the entire crew Everyone looks miserably
hot in the Tunisian sun

Anthony Daniels tries to reset his position then stumbles
slightly We hear a snap

ANTHONY DANIELS
I’m sorry to interrupt but could
someone lean me against something
I believe my foot may be bleeding

Lucas pulls Mark aside and they have a heart-to-heart

LUCAS
Mark the converters don’t matter
The point is you’re unhappy You
want a future out there in the
stars but everyone around you tells
you to just be safe and stay where
you are

Lucas has a moment He’s clearly been talking about himself

MARK
I just don’t get it George It’s
just hard you know I’1l get it

LUCAS
I know Let’s go again Places
Let’s try this one a little faster

Everything resets Everyone looks at R2D2
Nothing happens A banging noise is heard

KENNY
(from inside R2)
Batteries are dead Somebody
restart this thing or get me my
cigarettes

KURTZ
(frustrated)
Let’s just break for lunch

EXT TUNISIAN DESERT - TENT - DAY

Lucas very sullen sits in the corner of the tent Kurtz
walks in

LUCAS
(dead serious)
I need to kill someone

KURTZ
Haha Yeah I know the feeling
LUCAS
No It’s not a joke It’s for the
movie
KURTZ

Do you need some water George

LUCAS
Maybe I could kill C3P0O Ar No
one would care At the end of the
day most of the audience will still
see him as just a robot

KURTZ
Oh You’re talking about a
character -- wait a minute The

script is locked We’re in
production You can’t make any more
big changes

Lucas takes out a pair of scissors and meticulously cuts off
a few pieces of his hair

LUCAS
Maybe I should kill Chewbacca He’s
the most loyal in the group it
would be like killing a dog People
might respond to that

KURTZ
This movie is for kids Kids don’t
want you to kill their fucking dog

LUCAS
I think they do
KURTZ
Before you do anything you need to
call Ladd back He’s called five
times

A scrawny PA wearing yellow athletic shorts enters the tent

PA
I’m sorry Mr Lucas There’s a
problem

KURTZ

I told you not to bother us unless--
PA

There’s some sort of army here and
they want to speak to our general

EXT TUNISIAN DESERT - DAY

Lucas and Kurtz stand in front of a line of military
vehicles A Libyan man in a Gadhafi-esque military uniform

and dark sunglasses jumps out of a military truck
The LIBYAN OFFICER speaks only in Arabic
LIBYAN OFFICER
(in Arabic)

Who is in charge here

TUNISIAN DRIVER
They want to know who is in charge

KURTZ
Are you the translator

TUNISIAN DRIVER
I’m your driver

KURTZ
Sorry

LUCAS
Tell them that--

KURTZ
George let me handle this

LUCAS
Fine tell them he’s in charge

The Tunisian driver makes expressive hand gestures that
symbolize facial hair as he speaks Arabic to the Libyans

TUNISIAN DRIVER
(in Arabic)
The bearded man with no mustache is
in charge We are a film crew

LIBYAN OFFICER
(in Arabic)
If you are just a film crew why do
you have a tank

The driver turns back to Kurtz and Lucas

TUNISIAN DRIVER
He wants to know why you have a
tank

KURTZ
What fucking tank

TUNISIAN DRIVER
(In Arabic)
What tank

LIBYAN OFFICER
(in bad English)
Tank

The Officer points violently at the armored sandcrawler
transport facade

LUCAS
Oh The sandcrawler Just explain
what it is

TUNISIAN DRIVER
I don’t know what it is

As Lucas explains what it is the Tunisian Driver translates
what he says

LUCAS TUNISIAN DRIVER
It is not a tank We are on (in Arabic)
another planet It isa It is not a tank We are on
sandcrawler It collects another planet It is a
robots for scrap metal and to sandcrawler It collects
resell them robots for scrap metal and to

resell them
The Officer calls for troops with guns to come to his side

TUNISIAN DRIVER (CONT’D)
I’m not sure they understand

LUCAS
Well I don’t know how much clearer
I could be

KURTZ
For god’s sake tell them it’s just
a fucking movie before they shoot
us

TUNISIAN DRIVER
This is a just a film It is all
fake a set for Science Fiction

LIBYAN OFFICER

He signals to the troops and they all march into the
sandcrawler

EXT EMI STUDIOS - DAY

Peter Mayhew dressed in corduroy pants and a jacket looks
like a lost puppy standing in the walkway between the various
soundstages He towers above dozens of extras in half
completed alien and creature costumes who are milling about
outside

HARRISON (0OS)
Let me take a guess you’re Peter

On his words the crowd of extras part for Harrison Ford like
he’s Moses walking through the red sea Harrison is in black
pants a long sleeve v-neck and a vest It’s nearly the
entire Han Solo costume but looks completely natural on him

HARRISON (CONTD)
It’s about time we met

Harrison extends his hand and Peter shakes it

PETER
It’s a pleasure

Despite the fact that Peter is nearly a foot-and-a-half
taller than Harrison it’s immediately clear who the Alpha
dog in this relationship will be

HARRISON
Come with me

INT EMI STUDIOS - STAGE 3 - DAY

Harrison and Peter walk through the massive soundstage
populated by crew members still constructing the set

Freeborn the British costume designer approaches Harrison
with a huge Peter Pan shawl-type collar in his hands

FREEBORN
Excuse me Harrison I heard you
had a problem with the collar Does
it not fit right

HARRISON
Na fits like a glove Great work
I’m just not wearing it

FREEBORN
What Why

HARRISON
Because it looks ridiculous Also
when Kurtz says “I warned you he’s
still difficult to work with” do me
a favor and give him a big kiss for
me will you

Freeborn steps back and looks at Harrison’s costume
FREEBORN

If I make you a belt will you wear
it

HARRISON
Sounds great

Freeborn exits Peter is in awe and impressed by Harrison’s
audacity

HARRISON (CONTD)
Youre with me Pete right The
collar’s terrible

PETER
I didn’t realize it was appropriate
for actors to say something-

HARRISON
To hell if it’s appropriate it had
to be said Sometimes you just
gotta tell someone to shove it up
their ass you know

PETER
To be honest I don’t really use
much profanity

HARRISON
George is real talented but
personally I think he’s bitten off
more than he can swallow with this
one Have you read the script

PETER
Yes I didn’t understand much of
it but I admire Mr Lucas for
trying to do something so
ambitious

HARRISON
Yeah Sure Maybe But some of that
dialogue Just because George can
write that shit doesn’t mean we can
say it

Peter has been so intently making eye contact with Harrison
that he hasn’t noticed what they were walking towards He
turns his head and sees for the very first time THE
MILLENNIUM FALCON

PETER
My god

The Falcon looks exactly as we know it from the movies
painstakingly designed and created to look as though it’s
been through hundreds of adventures

HARRISON
The Millennium Falcon Man
that’s a stupid name

FISHER (0OS)
Hey everyone

Harrison and Peter turn Carrie Fisher is standing at the
entrance to the soundstage in the full Princess Leia costume
including the iconic hair buns Her arms are spread wide as
if she’s offering a hug to the entire production crew She
looks stunning

FISHER (CONT’D)
I’m here

PETER
Oh that must be the princess

HARRISON
Yeah The princess

Peter’s eyes get a little wide

HARRISON (CONTD)
I’ve seen that look before Want me
to introduce you

PETER
(stammering)
Oh -- I’m not -- I wasn’t --

HARRISON
Whatever you say Pete

INT EMI STUDIOS - PRODUCTION OFFICES - DAY

Kurtz sits behind a desk reviewing the shoot schedule Lucas
doodles potential shots in a notebook Freeborn is in the
center of the room holding the collar

LUCAS
Why won’t he wear it

FREEBORN
Because um He thinks it looks
ridiculous

LUCAS
Hmm

KURTZ
I told you he’d be difficult to
work with

Freeborn bites his lip
Bunny enters the production offices

BUNNY
George - we’ve got a crisis

LUCAS
We already know about the collar

BUNNY
No Not that A real crisis Alec
Guinness just quit

KURTZ
Fuck

INT ALEC GUINNESS’ TRAILER - DAY

Alec Guinness the consummate British actor quickly but
systemically packs his suitcase

ALEC
Please understand this is not
personal I just believe I am not a
good fit for what you trying to do
here

LUCAS
Um so I probably should have
spoken to you before I killed you

ALEC
Well that would have been the more
professional approach

LUCAS
I just really think that you dying
will add a lot of weight to the
story

ALEC
Death is not my objection I’ve
died a thousand deaths on the stage
and screen It’s the later part

LUCAS
When you tell Luke to trust the
force

ALEC
I don’t want to be a ghost

Alec composes himself He gets back to packing

ALEC (CONTD)
I apologize but your entire film is
ludicrous I wanted to work with
one of you younger American
directors because I’ve been
impressed with the films I had seen
but -- you’ve gone too far An
audience will not accept a ghost
They’1l be laughing at us They’1l
be laughing at me

Alec closes his bag Lucas is silent for a few seconds his
mind racing through anything he can say to make Guinness
stay

LUCAS
Listen I know this whole movie
might be a little out there -- to
be honest sometimes I even have
doubts if this will all come
together

ALEC
You’re not helping your case

LUCAS
But I also know to have any chance
of succeeding we all need to put
aside our doubts and commit to the
story we’re telling I’m begging
you to be fearless and to help me
tell my story

Alec deposits his bag back on the couch
ALEC

No passion more effectively robs an
actor of his power than fear

LUCAS
(cautiously)
I agree
ALEC

I will continue But I want to be
wrapped by the end of the month

LUCAS
(hiding panic)
Oh sure We can do that no
problem No problem at all

INT EMI STUDIOS - PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT
Lucas and Kurts look back at the schedule

KURTZ
If we combine these two days we can
get him out in time but we’re
gonna have to expand the lighting
crew again

LUCAS
Then that seems easy enough

KURTZ
Well we need to get some more
money from Alan eventually if we’re
gonna do that and considering he’s
demanding dailies to show the board
at Fox and you haven’t been
returning his calls

LUCAS
Hmm

Lucas flips through some photographs of X-Wing models on his
desk

LUCAS (CONT’D)
Call Dykstra and have him set
something up at ILM He can show
Laddy some space ships Everybody
likes space ships

EXT INDUSTRIAL LIGHT and MAGIC COMPLEX - DAY

Alan Ladd stands in front of about a half dozen members of
the 20th Century Fox board and their chairman Mr Stanfill
in the parking lot of a warehouse It’s a sweltering day but
they’re all still dressed in their stiff dark suits

ALAN LADD
I understand there have been some
concerns about the lack of dailies
on The Star Wars project but today
we will put those fears to rest
(MORE)

ALAN LADD (CONTD)
George has assured me that the
special effects being done in this
building will be what makes it one-
of-a-kind This company ILM is
nothing short of the future of
film

He gestures for them to follow him as he cracks open an
industrial steel door

Ladd triumphantly opens the door and we see-

INT INDUSTRIAL LIGHT and MAGIC COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

LOUD MUSIC BLARES The inside of ILM looks like a hippie
commune Shaggy haired employees lounge around and chat A
record player blasts “Truckin” by The Grateful Dead

DYKSTRA
Hey guys what’s happenin’

The executives turn and see JOHN DYKSTRA He’s the
shaggiest guy in the building and also the special effects
supervisor His hair is soaking wet and he has a towel around
his waist

MR STANFILL
Did you just get out of a pool son

DYKSTRA
Yeah man

Dykstra gestures to a shipping container filled with water
at the far end of the warehouse Several other long haired
guys are tossing a beach ball around in it

DYKSTRA (CONT’D)
Pretty great right It gets really
hot in here

No one knows quite what to say

ALAN LADD
You’re John right
DYKSTRA
Yeah man John Dykstra we met

before

He shakes Alan’s hands and starts shaking hands with all the
other execs

Dykstra takes his towel off and starts drying his hair
44

ALAN LADD
I wanted to show them all some of
the progress George assured me
there are some great things going
on here

He finishes drying his hair and throws the towel in a corner

DYKSTRA
Fuck yeah man We’re state of the
art here You’re not gonna see this
shit anywhere else What I’m sayin’
is you money guys are putting your
money in the right place

Without warning some ILM guys in the background let go of a
rope and a refrigerator CRASHES into the floor

After a silence

DYKSTRA (CONTD)
We wanted to hear what it sounded
like when a refrigerator exploded

MR STANFILL
Alright I think we’ve seen enough
I need to get back to the lot
(to Ladd)
You better figure out something
‘cause your butt’s on the line on
this one

Stanfill leaves

BOARD MEMBER 1
So much for the future of film

Ladd is left alone with Dykstra

ALAN LADD
--ah fuck You guys have been
working here for six months--

DYKSTRA
We got stuff comin’ man Relax
Good shit takes time

ALAN LADD
I want to see twenty shots by the
end of this week or you guys are
all getting fired

DYKSTRA
The thing is like We all
technically work for Georgeso

you can’t really fire us per
se but look man it’s gonna all
be great

Alan Ladd starts breathing heavy

ALAN LADD
Do you have a phone I need to talk
to him immediately

DYKSTRA
George Good luck man I can’t get
through to him They’re pretty
behind schedule in England

Ladd wipes sweat away from his forehead
DYKSTRA (CONTD)

I got another suit if you want to
go for a swim

INT EMI STUDIOS - MILLENNIUM FALCON COCKPIT SET - DAY

Peter in his full Chewbacca costume sits in the pilot seat
of the Millennium Falcon A HAIR STYLIST adjusts Fishers
Princess Leia buns

Lucas stands next to Fisher and directs her
LUCAS
And thats how just before this
you escape the Death Star
FISHER
(pointing at Mayhew)
So he flies the ship and I yell

LUCAS
Essentially Peter are you ready

Peter gives a hairy thumbs up and Lucas steps away

BILLY THE PA a skinny kid who looks just out of high school
claps a clapboard in front of the camera

LUCAS (CONTD)
Action

Off screen crew shake the cockpit set and Chewbacca paws at
the controls and bobs his head in all directions

FISHER
Weve lost the lateral controls

LUCAS
Cut

Lucas climbs back into the cockpit

FISHER
Was that not the right kind of
yelling

LUCAS
No the yelling was fast enough
Peter

The hairy head of Chewbacca turns towards Lucas

LUCAS (CONTD)
Why are you banging the controls
like that We need to actually
believe you can fly the ship when
Han Solo hands it off to you It
needs to be more deliberate

Lucas returns to the director’s chair

LUCAS (CONTD)
Action

FISHER
Weve lost the lateral controls

Peter bangs the controls exactly like he was doing before and
his head bobs even more

LUCAS (0S)
Cut Thats not it Thats not it
at all
PETER
(muffled)
Im sorry I tried to--
LUCAS
Damn it I can’t hear you Take off

the mask

Peter pulls off the Chewbacca head His hair is drenched in
sweat and his face is pale Fisher is still sitting right
next to him and can’t help but feel sympathy
FISHER
Leave it alone George Hell get
it

Kurtz approaches from the side

KURTZ
George we gotta break now Half
the crew left when you yelled cut

LUCAS
What

KURTZ
Youre fifteen minutes over and
these are the British unions
That’s what happens

Kurtz glances at the call sheets on his clipboard

KURTZ (CONTD)
(to Peter)
Can you come back tomorrow

PETER
Actually I’m scheduled for work at
the hospital tomorrow and I can’t
really make any changes Mr
Whitaker said--

LUCAS
I’m taking the biggest risk of my
career and this guy is too scared
to even ask his boss for time off

Lucas gives a dirty look to Kurtz
LUCAS (CONT’D)
This is what you get when you don’t

work with real actors

Lucas leaves angrily Kurtz and the remaining crew avoid
making eye-contact with Peter

FISHER
Hey Can I buy you lunch

PETER
Really

FISHER
Yeah I found the best place in
town

CUT TO

EXT BRITISH PUB - DAY

From across the road we see a classic British pub but

INT PUB CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

Inside the pub building is a red walled Chinese restaurant
gaudily decorated At a center table Peter and Fisher sit
across from each other Giant Peter now dressed in street
clothes and Fisher who hasnt bothered to change out of her
Princess Leia costume are definitely the most unusual couple
at the restaurant

Theres awkward silence as Peter looks around the restaurant
He takes a sip from a tiny Chinese teacup

FISHER
Im not wearing any underwear

Peter chokes a little

PETER
I beg your pardon

FISHER
Sorry I didnt mean to say it that
scandalously But its true Im
not allowed to with the costume

PETER
Why not

FISHER
George says theres no underwear in
space

Peter considers this for a moment

PETER
Well I suppose that does make
sense now that I think about it
Because of gravity and everything

Fisher bursts out in laughter Peter smiles but hes
uncertain what shes laughing at

FISHER
Youre funny

PETER
No Im not

FISHER
You are I can see it in your eyes
when were on set

Fisher puts her hand on Peter’s he smiles but then shyly
pulls away

PETER
Maybe for a giant Im funny but
thats not fair theres not much
competition Next to you Harrison
and Mark Im about as interesting
as a rusty tea-kettle

FISHER
Oh please Harrison Well hes
not as interesting as he thinks he
is

PETER

Well I’m just worried I may be a
bit of a disappointment I’m not
really a professional and I see
George’s grand vision of the movie
but I don’t think I quite live up
to it

FISHER
You feel like you ended up here by
accident and you’re completely in
over your head

PETER
How’d you know

FISHER
That’s always how it feels It
doesn’t get easier You just have
to learn to relax I have no idea
what I’m doing in this movie but
George keeps telling me I’m doing
great

PETER
You’re probably right but I still
have my brother’s words in my head
saying everyone’s just trying to
take advantage of me and I’11 end
up on my ass

FISHER
Please you want to talk about
being taken advantage of -- I was

in a movie before I was even born
Bundle of Joy my mother was
pregnant when she made it and I
played the bundle

PETER
Oh your mum’s an actress

FISHER
You don’t know My mom is Debbie
Reynolds You actually didn’t know

PETER
I don’t even know who that is

FISHER
Oh come on You do Tammy The
Unsinkable Molly Brown Singing in
the Rain

PETER
Singing in rain That seems rather
foolish You’d get awfully wet

FISHER
You haven’t seen Singing in the
Rain What movies have you seen

PETER
What’s a movie

Fisher takes a moment and looks him right in the eyes
FISHER
You son-of-a-bitch you’re messing
with me
He raises his glass of tea and winks He’s known all along
FISHER (CONTD)

You know I even believed you for
half a second

PETER
Maybe I’m not as bad an actor as I
thought

FISHER
Remember -- just relax and go with
the flow

Peter takes off the mask and sees Fisher watching with the
crew She gives Peter a big thumbs-up and he grins

Harrison pops out of his seat and pats Peter on the head as
he gets out of the cockpit

HARRISON

INT KINGS COLLEGE HOSPITAL - ADMINISTRATORS OFFICE - DAY

PETER
Yes sir

MR WHITAKER
I didn’t have to say yes you

accommodating

PETER
I appreciate that sir

MR WHITAKER
Do you It certainly doesn’t seem
that way from your behavior If
someone had done a favor like this
for me Id be doing everything I
could to stay in their good graces
I would have called in to check on
things I would have invited my
boss to the set even

PETER
I’m sorry sir

Whitaker leans in

her head that someone in the family
ought to be a respectable actor be
classically trained and that
bullshit so instead of a sweet
sixteen she shipped me off to
England

Peter gets handed a full and somewhat disgusting looking
plate of food

HARRISON

Harrison’s head is popped out of his trailer He runs outside
to greet Peter

INT DEATH STAR COMMAND OFFICE SET - DAY

Two storm troopers run down the hallway with Obi Wan Kenobi
R2D2 C3PO and Chewbacca

LUCAS
Cut I think we got it Let’s get
the stuff with the masks off

The first storm trooper takes off his mask it’s Mark Hamill
Then the second one takes of his mask - it’s Harrison Ford

No wait a minute it’s not Harrison Ford it’s a guy that
looks just like him

LUCAS (CONTD)
Is that the stunt double This
isn’t a stunt Where’s Harrison

BILLY THE PA
I’m sorry Mr Lucas I couldn’t
find him He wasn’t in his trailer

KURTZ
If he’s off fucking around again
like during Graffiti this is the
last time we’re putting him ina
movie

MARK
He gets a stunt double for this
Why do I have to do all this
running

LUCAS
Does anyone know where Harrison is
or what he’s doing

Peter takes off his mask He starts to say something but
hesitates

Peter hands the Chewbacca head to the Billy the PA and runs
off set

KURTZ
Where’s he going
EXT EMI STUDIOS - TRAILERS - DAY

Peter his body still in the Chewbacca costume knocks on a
trailer door that says “C Fisher”

There’s no response
He knocks more vigorously

FISHER (0S)
One second I need to put something
on

His face lengthens in surprise

Fisher opens the door she is wearing a red silk robe with
nothing underneath

FISHER (CONT’D)
Oh Peter It’s you

Peter looks down at his feet

PETER
Oh I was looking for Harrison - I
thought he might be - because I saw
you two together before - but - I
guess not - if you do happen to see
him -

HARRISON (0S)
Someone looking for me

Fisher opens the door completely and we see Harrison sitting
on the couch in his underwear

PETER
They need you on set The Death
Star command center um and the
storm troopers--

HARRISON
Alright let me get some pants

Harrison squeezes past Peter and walks away from the trailer
still without pants

Peter gives Fisher a quizzical look

FISHER
I ripped his pants off

He looks on the floor and sees Harrison’s jeans with a rip
from the crotch down the leg

PETER
Oh So you did

Fisher takes out a cigarette lights it and takes a drag

FISHER
Yeah he’s pretty fun for a married

guy
INT EMI STUDIOS - PRODUCTION OFFICES - DAY
Bunny sits at her desk on the phone
BUNNY
No I don’t think it will be the
worst movie ever made
(laughs)

Okay maybe the second worst

Alan Ladd marches into the reception area Bunny takes a deep
gulp and hangs up the phone

ALAN LADD
Where is he

BUNNY
Oh Mr Ladd You’re in England
INT EMI STUDIOS - OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY

Before Ladd can open the editing room door Lucas steps in
front of him and blocks his way

LUCAS
I can’t let you go in there

ALAN LADD
This isn’t up for discussion I
need to see where we are

LUCAS
So many things still need to come
together The rough assembly really
won’t give you a good idea I mean
even I’m frustrated with the
dailies I’ve seen

ALAN LADD
You’re frustrated I’m being barred
from a room How do you think I
feel

LUCAS
I still think it can come together

ALAN LADD
Jesus Christ Open the door and
stop acting like a child

LUCAS
Mr Ladd I apologize but I have no
choice but to formally refuse your
request

Lucas tries to look firm

ALAN LADD
Formally

LUCAS
Yes

ALAN LADD

George I’m watching what you have
or I’m shutting you down Don’t
think I won’t shut you down

Lucas steps out of the way and Ladd advances into the editing
suite

Lucas waits in the hallway He starts looking in drawers and
file cabinets He can’t find what he’s looking for He kicks
a trash can

Down the hallway he opens the drawer of a small metal desk
and finds a pair of scissors He cuts off some hair throws
the scissors back in the desk and slams the drawer

INT EMI STUDIOS - EDITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The room is dark and clicking sounds are heard as Lucas paces
next to a Moviola which is projecting the currently assembled
Star Wars scenes onto its small screen

Sitting in front of the screen is JIM JYMPSON who
despite being an editor wears a three-piece suit and seems
even more formal than Alan Ladd standing next to him

On screen we see Han Solo talking with Jabba the Hutt in
front of the Millennium Falcon except Jabba is a fat
Irishman in a sheepskin vest

HAN SOLO
Look Jabba even I get boarded
sometimes

JYMPSON
Oh this is a particularly
difficult sequence No coverage at
all

LUCAS
There’s not supposed to be

ALAN LADD
Who’s this Irish guy I don’t
remember him in the script

Jympson freezes the projector on an image of Han and the
Jabba actor

LUCAS
That’s what I was trying to say
We’re not even using this you
shouldnt be watching it

ALAN LADD
If it’s not in the film why is it
being edited

JYMPSON
I find it’s best not to ask that
question

LUCAS

Jim please now is not the time
The plan is to replace the actor
with a stop-motion effect from ILM

ALAN LADD
ILM is a goddamn joke George

LUCAS
If they don’t have time we’ll just
cut the scene

JYMPSON
Business as usual around here Very
unprofessional

LUCAS
Shut the fuck up Jim
INT EMI STUDIOS - OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY

Lucas and Ladd stand alone in a long hallway Ladd takes out
a pack of Newport cigarettes lights one and slowly inhales

ALAN LADD

It doesn’t look good George but
LUCAS

Alan--
ALAN LADD

But it’s not terrible either Ford
seems charming enough and I like
that thing his dog thing it’s

funny

LUCAS
He’s not really supposed to be
funny

ALAN LADD

Look that’s not the point I’m not
pulling the plug but you’ve got to
get things together You need to
tighten up around here and get
things back on schedule

LUCAS
Okay

ALAN LADD
And start mailing me those dailies
I went out on a limb for you for
this don’t fuck me

LUCAS
I’ll get things back on schedule

ALAN LADD
Good

LUCAS
Alan I know Hollywood is filled
with cover-your-ass executives
You’re either a genius or a crazier
fuck than me

ALAN LADD
I think you have a real vision but
thank me when we’re done

Lucas walks back into the editing suit

INT EMI STUDIOS - EDITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

LUCAS
Mr Jympson I wanted to apologize
for my behavior You were right I

JYMPSON
Ah I’m glad you are capable of
admitting fault That will serve

you well

LUCAS
Oh and one more thing you’re
fired

A Bee Gees record plays loudly Mark Hamill is standing
awkwardly next to Anthony Daniels by the record player
ANTHONY DANIELS

bacchanalian considering our early
start time tomorrow

Mark picks up the Bee Gees record sleeve

MARK
I love these guys They were born
in England you know

ANTHONY DANIELS
I’m afraid I prefer Opera over
today’s popular music

MARK

hospital to cover for me

HARRISON
That-a-boy

Harrison hands Peter the joint

PETER
So how exactly does one go
about

FISHER

Haha You’re in This is going to
be fantastic

HARRISON
Okay it’s kind of like smoking a
cigarette but just make sure you
take a big inhale and hold it

Without asking any more questions Peter sucks in with all
his strength and takes the biggest hit in the history of
marijuana

His deep uncontrollable cough sounds like a sick walrus

FISHER
Oh my god are you okay

Peter stands up
PETER
Yes Quite That’s wow that’s
rather powerful isn’t it

Peter stands up and struggles a bit to get his balance

PETER (CONTD)

head on the way out

members of the crew on each side of the trash compactor walls
manually pushing them in

same pace

Lucas goes off to work with the crew Peter takes off his
mask He’s drenched in sweat and looking glum

MARK

Harrison and Fisher both laugh

MARK

HARRISON
What’s the problem Was my brain
not big enough for you

FISHER
Hey Peter I bet you’ve gota
pretty big brain

Peter shrugs
PETER
I’ve never measured but Id
estimate it’s about the size of a
newborn’s arm

Fisher and Harrison laugh Peter cracks a smile

MARK
Hey he’s in on this too What am I
missing

HARRISON

Don’t worry about it kid
Lucas comes up to them

LUCAS
Alright we’re going to go again

sized serving of fried rice chow mein and beef with
broccoli in front of him Fisher stares at a hot and sour

soup that she hasn’t touched

PETER
You should eat something

Fisher doesn’t respond

PETER (CONTD)
Would you like some of my rice

She looks down at her soup
PETER (CONT’D)
Guess I’ll just have to eat it all
myself then

Peter smiles at Fisher but she doesn’t crack

PETER (CONT’D)
Youre making this very awkward
you know

Fisher starts talking without making eye contact

FISHER
I just get really sad sometimes out
of nowhere and I can’t control it

PETER
I know this is a delicate issue
but at the hospital I’ve worked
with some manic-depressive
psychiatric patients and--

FISHER
Thank you You know nobody else
will ever agree that I’m completely
fucked up

PETER
Well you aren’t messed up it’s a
medical condition--

FISHER
Stop I like you better when you
tell the truth Admit it I’m
totally fucked up

Peter hesitates

FISHER (CONT’D)
Come on

PETER
Alright A lot of times I look at
you and I say she’s a bit screwy
in the head that one

FISHER
Thank you

Peter stops eating
PETER

You’re not so different though
Everybody’s got their issues

FISHER
What do you know about it

PETER
Look at me I’m a physical freak of
nature

FISHER

Peter no you’re a sweetheart--

PETER
Hey honesty right

She makes direct eye contact with Peter

FISHER
You are freakishly tall and it
makes everyone incredibly
uncomfortable

He looks right back at her

PETER
You’re only ever way too happy or
way too sad and it drives everyone
looney

FISHER
When we first met I thought you
looked like a monster and probably
lived in a cave

PETER
You desperately hit on everyone you
meet

FISHER
I find your feet disgusting

PETER
I find your general demeanor
reprehensible

Fisher lets out a big sigh

FISHER
Can I have some rice

PETER
Absolutely not

Peter smiles and slides over the bowl

INT DEATH STAR CORRIDOR - DAY

holding lightsabers with twirling wooden blades

A large group of cast and crew is crowded off camera
watching Mark squeezes in between Peter and Harrison

MARK
Hey did I miss it

PETER
No they’ve just been practicing
their lightsaber moves

HARRISON
The old man’s not too bad with a
sword either

MARK
I wish I got to fight someone with
my lightsaber and not just that
stupid ball

OBI-WAN
Only a master of Evil Darth

Their swords connect Obi-Wan spins and strikes again

He delivers his lines with full Shakespearean bravado

OBI-WAN (CONTD)
You cant win Darth If you strike
me down I will become more
powerful than you can possibly
imagine

Harrison elbows Mark

HARRISON
(whispering)
That’s why he gets to do the sword
fights

Vader and Obi-Wan’s swords collide again

LUCAS
Cut We got it

KURTZ
That’s a wrap on Sir Alec Guinness

The entire cast and crew erupts into applause Prowse takes
off the Vader mask and shakes Guinness’ hand The ovation
continues and Guinness has no choice but to give a small bow

He’s immediately crowded by people patting him on the back
and telling him what an honor it’s been to work with him
Harrison is one of them

HARRISON
That was really great just then

ALEC
Thank you Mr Ford

HARRISON
So I guess you ended up buying
George’s whole vision after all
huh

ALEC
Please I still think this film is
likely to ruin my entire legacy
But one must always act well their
part for that my dear boy is
where all honor lies

HARRISON
That’s pretty good

ALEC
It should be It’s Alexander Pope

Nobody knows who that is

HARRISON
Well look it was really great
working with you

ALEC
A bit of advice one actor to
another

He puts his hand on Harrison’s shoulder

ALEC (CONTD)
Quit cheating on your wife it
makes everyone think you’re a
bastard

Alec walks off leaving Harrison alone with his thoughts
Fisher runs up to him

become

Carrie pats Peter on the back

here as someone else I can toast
to

Everyone laughs and drinks Off to the side Kurtz and Lucas

EXT KINGS COLLEGE HOSPITAL - DAY

Peter ducks his head as he gets off the bus at the hospital

INT KINGS COLLEGE HOSPITAL - MR WHITAKER’S OFFICE - DAY

Mr Whitaker is buried behind a stack of papers at his desk
Peter enters holding two tickets in his hand

PETER
Good morning Mr Whitaker

MR WHITAKER
Well look who it is The big movie
star now back among us common
people Tell me how is the
filming Mr Mayhew

PETER
It’s been going by so fast I can’t
believe there is only a month left

Mr Whitaker is unimpressed

PETER (CONTD)
Here I got you these

He hands the tickets to Mr Whitaker

PETER (CONTD)

They said I could have two tickets
to the London premiere I was going
to invite my Mum’ but I thought
about what you said about
appreciating you for allowing me to
take the time off and I thought Id
give you both of the tickets

Mr Whitaker examines the tickets They are handwritten white
pieces of paper

PETER (CONTD)
Now these aren’t the actual
tickets of course but think of
them as a guarantee from me

Whitaker dismissively tosses them onto the desk

MR WHITAKER
You expect your guarantee to be
worth a horse’s trough after what
youve done

PETER
What I have done Mr Whitaker

MR WHITAKER
Yes Peter Do you not recall our
conversation when you gave me the
dates you requested off You
assured me they were final

PETER
That was final All my shifts were
worked

MR WHITAKER
By you

Peter looks down at the ground he knows he’s been busted

PETER
Nurse McGovern said she was happy
to take my shifts

MR WHITAKER
That’s not the point You were
trying to deceive me I’m just not
sure I can tolerate deliberate
deception That’s a terminatable
offense

Peter is silent he doesn’t know what else he can say

MR WHITAKER (CONTD)
Now if you’re willing to cut back
on these days off--

PETER
I’m sorry Mr Whitaker but they
need me there

MR WHITAKER
Well then maybe the offer is you
take no more days off or you don’t
bother coming back

PETER
Sir you’re being unreasonable

MR WHITAKER
No You are Surely they can stick
another giant in a furry suit

PETER
To hell with this

Peter slams his giant open hand down on the desk

PETER (CONTD)

You’re a petty jealous bully and
I’ve had enough of being treated
this way

Peter stands up towering over the seated Mr Whitaker

MR WHITAKER
(concealing that he’s
scared shitless)
If you walk out of here your job’s
going with you

PETER
I’d like you to do me a favor Mr
Whitaker

Peter points at the two tickets on Mr Whitaker’s desk
PETER (CONT’D)
I’d like you to take these two
tickets and shove them up your
arse I quit

Kurtz and Bunny look at Lucas slumped in his chair The phone
is on speaker

ALAN LADD
And what have you done

LUCAS
I know I havent sent them but
every time I send them you get the
wrong idea and I just dont want
you to get the wrong idea

ALAN LADD
Well guess what my ideas dont
matter anymore

LUCAS
What do you mean
ALAN LADD
The board is fed up with how much
money this production has sucked up
with nothing to show for it So
no more money

Lucas is unable to respond he almost seems numb

KURTZ
Alan hold on This is Kurtz here
youre on speaker

ALAN LADD
Great

KURTZ
Listen weve got enough left for
two weeks but thats impossible
We need a month Not like when
George says we need a month This
is real If you cant get us a
little more money well be turning
in an incomplete product youd
never be able to release it

ALAN LADD
Good thing we didnt guarantee a
release then isnt it

KURTZ
Alan for fuck’s sake

ALAN LADD
You guys created this problem I
tried to help and you stonewalled
me Now you have to face the
consequences

Ladd hangs up

In Lucas

MR STANFILL
If this thing loses any more money
youre fired

KURTZ
I guess if we split up into four
units and just run everybody
around without stopping Maybe
it’s possible

LUCAS
I’d end up killing myself if I
tried to do that

KURTZ
Well what do you want me to say
We don’t have any other choice

Kurtz leaves and Lucas looks devastated

INT MEN’S ROOM - EMI ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

Peter hums as he relieves himself at urinal He flushes and
moves to the sink to wash his hands when he hears a loud BANG
against a stall wall

He looks underneath but doesn’t see anyone’s legs

PETER
Everything okay in there

He pushes the door open slowly and we see the source -- it’s
Lucas curled up in a ball on the closed toilet He bangs his
head against the wall

LUCAS
(not making eye contact)
Oh it’s fine I’ve just been
huddled up here cutting my hair off
and trying to figure out why I ever
thought this movie was a good idea

PETER
Beg your pardon

LUCAS
What’s the point of all this stress
on something that will be terrible
This movie is going to ruin all our
lives

PETER
That’s not true

LUCAS
What do you know

Peter looks down at the ground with no response

LUCAS (CONT’D)
What are you doing here anyway
We’re not doing any Chewbacca
scenes today

PETER
I quit at the hospital

Lucas looks at Peter

LUCAS
Really Why

PETER
Honestly Because my boss was a
huge prick

Lucas laughs

PETER (CONTD)

And I was just tired of being
careful I’m a fucking giant after
all I decided it was time to start
acting like one

Peter doesn’t realize it but he’s struck a cord with Lucas

INT EMI STUDIOS - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

Hundreds of cast and crew members including Peter are
milling about the sound stage where the set for the medal
ceremony scene has been constructed

LUCAS (0S)
Excuse me excuse me-—

The chatter dies down slowly Eventually everyone turns and
faces Lucas who is standing on an elevated part of the set

LUCAS (CONT’D)
Look um things have been a little
rocky here I don’t think anyone’s
going to debate me on that

There are shattered chuckles of recognition from the crowd

LUCAS (CONTD)

I know sometimes I may seem like
I’m in my own world but I’m not so
blind that I can’t see when things
are--well--they haven’t been great
We’ve been divided because our
approaches

Close on Kurtz who nods in agreement

LUCAS (CONT’D)
Because of our backgrounds

Close on Anthony Daniels (C3PO) and Kenny Baker (R2D2) both
of whom look at each other and nod

LUCAS (CONTD)
Because of opinions about the uh
about the material

Harrison smirks

LUCAS (CONTD)
But what I’m saying is- let’s put
all that stuff behind us and take
this thing to the finish line We
have the chance here to do
something really special Something
that’s never been done before Sure
it’s risky but I think at the end
of the day no matter what your job
is here we all got into this
business to capture peoples’
imaginations If we can finish this
film I promise we’ll do just that

Lucas waits for a response from the hesitant crowd He makes
eye contact with Peter

Peter stands up tall
PETER
(to the whole crowd)
We’ve put up this long with your
crazy nonsense No point in giving
up now

Everyone laughs and it turns into cheers

CUT TO

INTEXT EMI STUDIOS - DAY

We see a MONTAGE of Lucas cast and crew frantically running
back and forth between the various stages at EMI studios
shooting scenes non-stop There are rapid costume changes
set changes and lens changes as they shoot

It’s like Day for Night but with Star Wars

We see behind-the-scenes angles of various iconic scenes

INT ROW HOUSE - LONDON - EVENING

TITLE OVER
London
Three Months Later

Peter sits in the living room with his parents Christopher
and Claire as well as Chris Jr and Beth The family is all
crowded around Chris Jr and Beth’s new baby girl FRIDA
PETER
(to Baby)
Hi there

Everyone smiles as Peter holds her Baby Frida starts to cry

PETER (CONTD)
Oh that’s no good

Baby Frida struggles and cries louder

BETH
Let me take her

PETER
Yeah that’s probably for the best

Beth takes the baby from Peter and exits into the other room
CHRIS JR
It’s been a long day for her I’m
sure that’s why she cried Not
because of

PETER
Right

There’s silence as everyone sips their tea
CHRISTOPHER
How’s the job search going Heard
you were going to a bunch of
hospitals this week

PETER
They take one look at how tall I am
and laugh me out of the interview
(ashamed)
I’m going to get kicked out of my
flat at the end of the month

CLAIRE
Well you could move in here
Peter I don’t know if our spare

room will fit that large bed of
yours but we can figure something
out

PETER
Thanks And thanks for none of you
saying I told you so about the
movie

Peter puts down his cup of tea

PETER (CONTD)
I don’t know why I expected
anything to come out of being the
freak in the sweaty costume

CHRIS JR
Pete I want you to take my
motorcycle

PETER
Well it’s a nice thought but I
don’t think so

CHRIS JR
Why not

PETER
It’s not built for someone my size
If I shift the wrong way I could
tip it over the seat’s too low and
if I raise it it might be too
high

BETH
Oh come on Peter

PETER
That’s just how I feel

CHRIS JR
Stop pitying yourself You never
did this when we were kids and to
be honest I always kind of looked
up to you for that

Chris Jr tries to hand Peter the keys

PETER
I just made a mess of my life
trying to pretend to be something
other than what I am I’m done with
it now

Peter flings the keys on the table and stands up to leave

CHRIS JR
Peter you need to embrace what you
did and move on You’1l find
another job and looking back on it
I bet you’1ll probably have great
memories from making The Star Wars

PETER
I don’t ever want to hear about
that bloody movie again

Peter smashes his fist against a shelf breaking it

PETER (CONTD)
I don’t want to hear it I don’t
want to see it I’m done with the
movie I’m done with the hospitals
I’m done with everything

Peter starts walking out of the house Chris Jr stands up

CHRIS JR
What are you gonna do go on the
dole and sit around

PETER
Why the hell not I’m not good for
anything else

Peter slams the door

INT FOX SCREENING ROOM - DAY

On screen is the medal ceremony at the very end of the movie
Luke and Han-Solo both have their medals Chewbacca yells
but it’s still Peter Mayhew’s muffled voice The iris effect
comes in and the reel runs out

Lights come up

Lucas comes out from the projector room and walks in front of
the screen

LUCAS
Okay so um like I said the
effects are temp and the score
and the sound and a few other
parts but I wanted to get your
feedback at this point So I
guess what’d you think

The screening room is empty except for four guys in their
early and mid thirties They are BRIAN DE PALMA STEVEN
SPIELBERG MARTIN SCORSESE and FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA No one says anything for a while

COPPOLA
Well it was very ambitious And
you clearly put a lot of yourself
into it which is something to be
proud of

The awkward silence continues to linger

SCORSESE
I think Uh it’s very
interesting very interesting what
youve done here Youre tapping
into this extraordinary revolution
in technology particularly
videogames Have you guys played
pong It reminded me a lot of pong
Especially the lighting The
lighting reminded me of pong

DePalma rolls his eyes

DE PALMA
Jesus You guys are shit for
friends

LUCAS

What are you trying to say Brian

DE PALMA
I mean it’s garbage George Really
just unwatchable garbage At least
Steve’s saying nothing at all
rather than lie to you and babble
about pong

SPIELBERG
I actually thought-
DE PALMA
Oh just shut up
LUCAS
Well when the effects are
finalized
DE PALMA

I’m not just talking about effects
What’s all this Force shit
Where’s all the blood when they
shoot people

LUCAS
Do you all feel this way

All of the directors look at each other

COPPOLA
No but The way scenes are
ordered You have some story

telling problems

DE PALMA
Yeah no shit he has some story
telling problems What the fuck was
that crawl Jedi Bendu who gives a
fuck

LUCAS
I just think it’s necessary to give
people background on who the Jedi
Bendu are and convey that they
founded the invincible Imperial
Space Force

DE PALMA
No one’s going to care about any of
that shit You just need to get
across the tone Start with
something like “Once upon a time in
a galaxy far far away” or some
bullshit like that

SCORSESE
Very smart Invoking both the
traditions of Fairy Tales and
Science Fiction right at the top

COPPOLA
That might work better

LUCAS
Okay thanks I’1l write something
like that up

DE PALMA
Oh no you don’t I’m writing it for
you

LUCAS

No you hate the movie

DE PALMA

Yeah but you’re just gonna make it
worse I’1l write it come on Ill
do it right now

De Palma and Lucas leave They are soon followed by Coppola
and Scorsese Spielberg is the only one who remains in the
screening room He looks up at the screen still unable to
wrap his head around what he has just watched

Alan Ladd sits down next to Spielberg

ALAN LADD
What did you think

SPIELBERG
Isn’t it more important what you
think

ALAN LADD
George is screening a more finished
cut for me next week I’m sure he’d
be furious if he knew I was asking
you about it

Spielberg strokes his beard composing his thoughts

ALAN LADD (CONTD)
Based on all I’ve heard and the
finishing costs I just don’t
think I can justify releasing it

SPIELBERG
You want my honest opinion

ALAN LADD
Spare me nothing

SPIELBERG
I think this is the greatest movie
ever made and it’s going to make
hundreds of millions of dollars

EXT HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DUSK

LUCAS
Trust me I needed a vacation

SPIELBERG
You gotta get working on your next
thing Now’s the time to do any
project you’ve ever dreamed of

LUCAS

dreamed of and it almost killed me

SPIELBERG
Well maybe we can do something
together We could do a James Bond
movie

Lucas considers this and looks at the cover of the Doc Savage
comic Doc has tan pants brown boots and a torn white shirt
He’s holding an old Smith and Wesson in one hand and an ancient
artifact in the other

LUCAS
