EXT HP SHIPYARDS HP BUS STOP - SUNRISE

An eight-year-old African-American girl with knockers in her
hair stands on a desolate sidewalk behind yellow caution
tape She licks a candy and gazes upwards - spellbound

A man in a hazmat suit glides along the pavement Darth Vader
breaths heaving from his space-mask He loads pieces of trash
and plants into hazardous waste bags In the distance more
men in hazmats crawl along a decaying dock collecting
various items

The little girl breaks her gaze and begins down the street
running her hand along the caution tape A voice appears

PREACHER (0S)

Why they got suits on and we dont
Something is going on right in
front of our face But you stuck on
your i-phone j-phone 12 whatever
Blow up in your hand You cant
Google whats goin’ on right now
They lucky I’m a man of god now Or
Id suicide bomb this mother-

Tracking with her we land on a black man in his Sunday best
He stands on a box shouting at nobody in particular

PREACHER
Are yall paying attention Why do
they have suits on and we don’t
Why Listen to me man

An old lady drives by and honks supportively at the Preacher
He waves without breaking focus

PREACHER
They here to clean this water Man
this water been funky as the devils
mouth for fifty years and now they
wanna clean it up Not for you
and me no sir They got plans for
us

He points his chin in disgust at the men in white suits

PREACHER (0S)
They got those suits on lookin like
a George Jetson rejects because
they weak Weak hearts Weak lungs
They cant even breathe out here
without a mask on We were made to
be put through hell to be purified

(MORE )
PREACHER (0S) (CONTD)
You understand what I’m saying
brothers and sisters That’s why I
urge you Do not consummate with
white women Protect the black seed
and leave us the hell alone Unless
you came to really help us

Across the street at a run-down bus stop two African-
Americans in their early 20s JIMMIE FAILS and MONTGOMERY
ALLEN look at the scene idly regarding it

JIMMIE
Crazy what jail will do to a nigga

Montgomery studies the man while he writes in his journal
PREACHER

They lucky I’m a man of God now or
they’d catch this fade

JIMMIE
You think he rehearses this every
morning

MONTGOMERY

Seems a bit more impromptu

JIMMIE
Hm

MONTGOMERY
I think he’s improv-ing

PREACHER
It’s 2019 out here we been yelling
about this water since before they
was born

Jimmie looks anxiously for the bus down the empty road
Camera begins to slowly push towards him

JIMMIE
Where’s this bus man We’re gonna
be late

MONTGOMERY
We’ll get there

PREACHER
So I urge y’all to fight for your
land

JIMMIE

We’re not gonna get there bro
PREACHER
Fight for your home Fight For
Your Home

JIMMIE
Let’s skate

Jimmie slowly looks to Mont

Mont turns to Jimmie

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - MORNING - TRAVELING

HP SHIPYARDS - Montgomery and Jimmie ride together on his
skateboard They kick and maneuver in unison

They skate past decaying docks and industrial buildings The
preachers sermon continues as the Main Score begins

PREACHER (VO)
This here THIS is the edge brah
The final frontier of manifest
destiny The last edge of the city
last edge of the country Man two
steps further and youd be drinking
that filthy salt water

ILLINOIS ST BRIDGE - Jimmie and Mont skate over the bridge

PREACHER
We built these ships dredged these
canals in the San Francisco they
never knew existed

HP CORNER STORE - The young men shoot past a corner store
with a man sitting in front of a mural of himself He waves

Hunters Point residents are out in their Sunday’s best

PORTOLA ROSE GARDEN - They pass construction workers pulling
apart a decaying roof across from cookie-cutter homes

PREACHER (VO)
And now they wanna build something
new Whole blocks half in the
past half in the future

BERNAL HILL - Jimmie and Mont climb a mountainous hill the
sun rising over the shipyards at their back As they summit
the final red boulder we see a sprawling civilization below
PREACHER (VO)
But should you venture into their
San Francisco the one they pillage
for gold remember your truth in
the city of facades

The young men walk hurriedly through an altogether different
world grand Victorians line the street

Jimmie and Montgomery zip towards the sprawling metropolis
The duo bomb a rollercoaster hill This is a serious journey

EXT DOWNTOWN - MORNING - Mont turns and stares out at all
the commuters He drinks in the city’s new population

TENDERLOIN - The young men pedal in unison past droves of
homeless A shoe flies by their heads They duck and turn to
see a crazed man running alongside them ripping off layers
of clothes as he keeps pace He shouts incoherently
PREACHER (VO)

Look at them look at you look down

at you But we built them
Jimmie and Montgomery skate past towering buildings

FILLMORE - The young men skate through an altogether
different world grand Victorians line the street

PREACHER (VO)
We are these homes Their eyes

We narrow in on the details of one very special home as we
intercut with details of Jimmie skating towards it

Two big attic windows like eyes stare down on the street
Jimmie staring forward focused skates with determination

PREACHER (VO)
Their pointed brims

A crooked witch hat tower sprouting from the roof
Jimmie’s beanie rises into frame as he pedals

PREACHER
We move as they move

An old curtain flaps in the window

Jimmies clutches his coat flapping alongside him
PREACHER
Our sweat soaked in the wood

Dew drops glisten on hand-carved fish scale walls
Jimmie’s cheeks are dotted with sweat

PREACHER
Gilded in our image

Jimmie’s gold chain floats upwards glinting in the light
A tall door with chipped gold leafing catches morning sun

The music climbs with each new detail until

EXT THE HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

Jimmie and Montgomery stand in silence They look up at a
beautiful but crumbling three-story Victorian

Jimmie crosses the street towards The House like a moth to a
flame Mont just behind

Jimmie and Mont approach the front gate and peer through the
bars

MONTGOMERY
Are you sure they’re gone

Jimmie pushes open the gate

MONTGOMERY (0S) (CONTD)
Jim

Jimmie floats up the steps beckoned by some higher spirit

JIMMIE
(almost to himself)
Her car’s gone

A couple with a stroller and dog pass Mont

MONTGOMERY
(trying to appear normal)
How you doing

The couple don’t seem to care Mont peeks back up to Jimmie
and closes the gate behind him gently

MONTGOMERY (CONTD)
Let’s check the back hm Remember
that time he was in the kitchen
JIMMIE
Sure yeah- But bra did I not tell
you
Jimmie presses a ring of paint swatches against the railing

JIMMIE (CONTD)
It’s Periwinkle Not Black

Mont ascends the step jotting this down into his book

MONTGOMERY
Mhmm got it

JIMMIE
Ugh This garden is a nightmare

Jimmie continues up the steps out of frame

SIDE ALLEY - Jimmie continues forward he’s on a mission

MONTGOMERY
I’1l bring my Grandpa’s tools next
time

JIMMIE
Sick

BACKYARD - Through an empty back window we see Jimmie rise
up the steps He peers into The House A moment of soothing
calm and then

JIMMIE
Jesus wallpaper’s peeling too
These people
MONTGOMERY
Yeah but Jim you’re not gonna go
inside
Jimmie’s eyes shift He has other ideas

He walks down the steps

JIMMIE
They’re definitely gone though

MONTGOMERY
Let’s be quick this time hm

JIMMIE
Yeah I know It just takes time
MONTGOMERY
I know I’1ll be at my spot

FRONT OF “THE HOUSE - Montgomery sits at his look-out perch
flipping past old sketches of Jimmie

Jimmie paints the windowsill

We cut wide to see he’s standing atop a bird bath

He leans onto his tippy toes to peer inside once more He
sees a sad yellow table in the empty room He leans forward a
little morea little more a-

WHAM A croissant hits the window beside him Jimmie turns

JIMMIE
Jesus

MARY AND TERRY ZWIGOTT stand there Mary has a fruit in her
hand ready to throw

MARY

TERRY

MARY

Jimmie tries to finish his job vigorously

JIMMIE

Jimmie continues to work faster

JIMMIE

MARY

JIMMIE

MARY

Jimmie jumps off BULLSEYE She pegs him with a bread loaf

Jimmie runs away She shakes her head in confused
frustration

JIMMIE
Water the plants in the back or I

MARY

Ugh Why am I always the villain

TERRY
Honey I don’t like these divisive
terms like villain

MARY
It’s insultingI’m at the
hospital all day long I wish I had
time to just fix up the house
wierd-ass kid

On the street Mont and Jimmie make a hasty escape Mont
drops the board and Jimmie leaps atop it

JIMMIE (0S)
Bro you were supposed to be look
out

MONTGOMERY (0S)
I got distracted

JIMMIE
You were the one so worried about
them coming home

They laugh
EXT HP SHIPYARDS MONTGOMERYS HOUSE - DAY - TRAVELING

Jimmie skates down the center of the street Montgomery
trotting beside him

They pass kids hiding in the bushes men in bowties selling
bean pies girl rappers and their DP shooting a video and a
man watching his grandson fix his car

JIMMIE
Bra what if OG is right - you
should really stop eating the fish
out there

MONTGOMERY
I think it’s fine I mean all fish
has mercury

JIMMIE
No but I saw a seagull with a
dick dude

MONTGOMERY
Well so I guess it was male

JIMMIE
Na bra like a human dick
Something wrong with that water
bra

MONTGOMERY
Eh my grandpa said the hazmats are
just there to scare us

JIMMIE
Nooo bro they’re not

We push past Jimmie and Montgomery past rocky projects and a
hand-painted station wagon and land on a group congregating
in front of Montgomerys home

NITTY
Bra dont kick that Tumbleweave on
me

Nitty dodges the ball of dirt weave and god knows what

As we near we see them clearly NITTY (the group leader)
GUNNA (the look out) FRESH (the quiet one) KOFI (Freshs
big cousin) STUNNA (talks too much) and a few others
Although this Greek Chorus homes are elsewhere in Hunters
Point this slab of concrete is where they live

STUNNA
Aye Kofi I seen your moms she was
missing a little bit on top

The group bursts out laughing Kofi gives a weak smile
trying to mask his wounded ego

Montgomery and Jimmie reach the front steps of the house

MONTGOMERY
I mean we shower in the same
water Jimmie

The Greek Chorus turns - having overheard this

GUNNA
So now these niggas showering
together

FRESH
Probably was

KOFI
Thats fruity

JIMMIE
Naw I was trying to tell him don’t
eat the fish it’s toxic

NITTY
Well Duh They built the atomic
bomb right there

The group looks out at the water Montgomery turns back to
Nitty A small wry smile spreads across Montgomery’s face

MONTGOMERY
(whispering to Nitty)
I don’t think that’s true

Jimmie and Montgomery slowly shuffle past the Greek Chorus up
to Montgomerys house an old sea captains lodgings
Hovering above the houses backyard are the most notorious
housing projects in the city

INT MONTGOMERYS LIVING ROOM - DUSK

Jimmie sits on the couch beside Montgomery and his GRANDPA
who both clutch beers Grandpas smile holds a hint of
widowed sadness hes too considerate to burden others with
The shimmering blue light of the TV illuminates the mens
faces as if radiating from an aquarium
POLICEMAN (ON TV)
Can I help you

EDMOND O’BRIEN (ON TV)
Id like to see the man in charge

MONTGOMERY
(whispering to Grandpa)
He’s walking him into the Chief’s
office
GRANDPA

GRANDPA

JIMMIE
Edward O Ryan

MONTGOMERY

POLICE CHIEF (ON TV)

They all lean in

EDMOND O’BRIEN (ON TV)

Montgomery and Grandpa chuckle

MONTGOMERY
Oh god

JIMMIE
What How

MONTGOMERY
Just watch

Through a window behind the trio we see Monts rowboat
hitched to a dock across the street Beyond the dock the
twinkling lights of ships sprinkle the Bay

INT MONTGOMERYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mont lies in bed writing a note on his wall

JIMMIE (0S)
Hey Mont Montgomery How do I
get them out of the house

MONTGOMERY
Hm

We can hear Jimmie Peeing

JIMMIE
What if I peed on their table

After a moment Jimmie peels back a curtain and leans into
Mont’s bedroom

JIMMIE (CONTD)

Like - I just climb the birdie
bath broke in and peed all over
the little stupid yellow table

MONTGOMERY
Wouldnt that ruin the floors

Jimmie climbs into his cot on the floor nested snug between
the bathroom and Montgomery’s bed

JIMMIE
Yeah I guess you got a point there

Jimmie stares at the ceiling still thinking
A gunshot reverberates in the distance

MONTGOMERY
44 magnum

JIMMIE
10 blocks

MONTGOMERY
Closer

JIMMIE
HmMaybe they’d let me live
there as like a caretaker for the
house

MONTGOMERY
We like having you here Jim

JIMMIE
I know braBut there’s no place
like home

Jimmie rolls over and looks at the wall We see a picture of
him as a young boy on the front porch with lots of family
Beyond the photograph we see old pin ups a work To Do list
for The House old photos of The House and more family
photographs

EXT MONTGOMERYS HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Faint echoes of laughter spill from the house Below the
Greek Chorus jaw playfully under a streetlight The Preacher
walks past them and they fall hush A distant foghorn groans

As he passes out of ear shot their laughter rises behind
him swallowing him up Cop car lights flash off screen

EXT HP DOCK HP BAY - MORNING

BLACK - with a pinhole pinch of light We are a rock in the
hand of a child Mischievous cackles surround us The child
launches us high into the sky

As we descend back to earth we tumble towards a group of
hidden kids who all scatter except one He sees them run off
and then looks up too late just as the camera hurtles
towards him - WACK - we collide with his head

From the bay we see two groups of warring neighborhood kids
hailing scores of rocks at each other from behind makeshift
forts A few scream insults borrowed from older brothers

Montgomery watches the dangerous childs game unfold from the
serenity of his rowboat a hundred yards out He sketches the

strange scene trying to capture the drama before him like a
blueprint for a future stage play

Suddenly a three-headed fish flops onto the deck of the
boat Montgomery stares at the floundering oddity

A moment later Mont is on the dock shouting lines leaping
back and forth as if playing opposing characters in a scene

He’s working out the lines of a shouting match between the
preacher and a hazmat clean up man

Mont gets a good idea and jots it down

INT CHINESE GROCERY - AFTERNOON

Bloop bloop Red Rock Cod swim in place in an overcrowded
tank A hand plunges into the tank and grabs one

Montgomery stands behind the fish counter of the Chinese
supermarket his apron smeared with fish guts Behind him
Mont’s colleague reaches around the tank Jimmie bored
making a whirlpool with his finger in the open tank

JIMMIE
Did you get any writing done this
morning

MONTGOMERY

Eh Mngh Writing is rewriting
Its all a part of it-

An old Chinese woman politely tries to flag Mont’s colleague

MONTGOMERY
I can help you ma’am

Jimmie swigs a Pepsi and Montgomery prepares her meat

EXT THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON - TRAVELING

Jimmie weaves down the street on his board He approaches
The House and slows to a halt in front

The windows glow as night approaches Inside Mary and Terry
mill about Jimmie reviews his paint job from days prior and
surveys the homes storybook magnificence

His eye catches something He approaches the house and yanks
an offending dog doo bag from the front vines He tosses it
in the neighbors yard and skates away

EXT RETIREMENT HOME - DUSK

A nurse helps an old man on the steps of a Victorian in the
Haight Jimmie skates in wearing orderly clothes He climbs
the steps where a few elderly residents sit

INT RETIREMENT HOME PHYLLISS ROOM - NIGHT

PHYLLIS a frail white woman with big scared eyes lies on
her bed hair perfectly brushed and draped in jewelry She
stares blankly at Jimmie as he removes her pants and preps
her for bed

LIZZIE her pretty granddaughter around Jimmies age sits on
a sofa across the room Her phone lights her oblivious face

Phyllis’ record player begins to skip Jimmie looks to Lizzie too
deep in swiping to notice the looping line over the mountain
Jimmie places Phyllis on the bed her pants halfway down

JIMMIE
(to Lizzie)
Oh no dont get up

Lizzie doesnt seem to hear him He fixes the needle He

returns to Phyllis and lifts her again She glances up at him
appreciatively and begins humming the tune

PHYLLIS
Thank you James

JIMMIE
Us natives gotta stick together

Her initial confusion turns to a nodding smile as if just
remembering she is a native
STUNNA (0S)
He SO soft tho You old marshmallow

13 EXT HP SHIPYARDS MONTGOMERYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Gunna and Fresh laugh hard as Kofi gets roasts Nitty pushes
through the uproar and gets in Kofi’s face laughing

NITTY

Mont walking home across the street sees Kofi getting punked
by his friends Mont sets his bag down staring intently

NITTY (0S)

INT MONTGOMERYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Montgomery looks deep into the full-length mirror He clears
his throat and takes a nip of whiskey from the cap He begins
trying on different voices for size

MONTGOMERY
Whats up nigga Whatis up

Hey nigga How are you nigga Good

EXT RETIREMENT HOME RECEPTION

Jimmie stands behind the front counter

EXT RETIREMENT HOME ROOF - PREDAWN

Jimmie sits on the steep roof of the retirement home eating
canned oysters and surveying the city below

In the far distance he can see the twinkling lights of The
House He gazes at it like a nightwatchman at his post as
the city begins to wake at his feet

INT MONTGOMERYS BEDROOM - MORNING

Jimmies signature beanie flannel and skate-worn khakis are
strewn across Monts bed as if worn by an invisible man

Mont opens the door in his long johns to find Jimmie standing
at his mirror Hes in low-hanging jeans and a studded belt
considering two different goon shirts

Montgomery freezes

MONTGOMERY
Are you going to see your dad

JIMMIE
I mean I was thinking about it
But nah You ready to go

MONTGOMERY
Nearly Ill get my tools

Mont nods and returns to brushing his teeth as he walks off

Jimmie self-consciously removes his fitted cap

EXT HP BUS STOP - AFTERNOON

Mont and Jimmie sit at their regular busstop waiting
gardening tools in hand

JIMMIE
Man where is this bus We got hella
gardening

MONTGOMERY
Hey Jim didn’t you used to live
in that car

JIMMIE
Oh god

The car wipes frame

JIMMIE (CONTD)
From a house to an El Dorado

A rusty car clunks toward them duck-farting and hiccuping
yellow smoke They watch the car as it gasps for breath

BOBBY a middle-aged man with a sunny disposition sticks his
head out of the taped-up window

BOBBY
Jimmay

JIMMIE
(unenthusiastically)
Hey Bobby

BOBBY
Haha Whats your farming ass doing
in the street with a rake

Jimmie tracks the car as it huffs its way out of frame

The car does an illegal U-turn hitting the curb across the
street and screeches to a halt in front of the young men

BOBBY
Where yall headed

Jimmie checks to make sure the bus isnt coming

INTEXT BOBBYS CAR - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING
Bobby nudges Jimmie jovially
BOBBY

Jimmie the farmer - with your bitch

A children’s 49er’s sticker stuck to the passenger car door

Jimmie’s scratches at it

JIMMIE
Still the same

Montgomery studies the backseat which has been converted
into a bedroom with satin sheets and window curtains

plastic bags litter the pillows

BOBBY
Yeah I like what you and your Pops
did with it

JIMMIE
So much you drove off with it

BOBBY
Aw Im just borrowing it But man

Mont mumbles to himself in the back as not to eavesdrop

Jimmie looks out the window sour

BOBBY

The car pulls to a stop

BOBBY
Look at these motherfuckers You

Bobby looks out his window at people in a park on laptops

BOBBY (CONTD)
Park full of ulcers and panic
attacks Hemorrhoids Wanting
responsibility Tryna own what’s
temporary

Bobby looks to Jimmie who stares at a burned out empty lot

BOBBY (CONT’D)
Shit that’s gonna be them next
though

Jimmie studies a mustachioed construction worker leaning
against the empty lot’s fence smoking a cigar

BOBBY (CONT’D)
Used to be 100 motherfuckers in
there With rent control They
thought that was theirs too
Landlord burned ‘em out Cuz he
thought it was his But you can’t
never own land in America

Jimmie doesn’t respond transfixed

BOBBY (CONT’D)
This car ain’t mine and it wasn’t
never yours Imma’ outlive your ass
too Jimmie
191

The worker breaths his smoke at Jimmie like a devil The
faint sounds of striking hammers rise We push towards the
worker over the fence and in the depths of hot tar fields

Hulking construction men zap at iron with welding torches and
pound away at hunks of steaming tar like satan’s henchmen

The sound of boiling bubbles rise as we cut to -

EXT THE HOUSE - AFTERNOON - TRAVELLING

Jimmie and Montgomery walk through the Fillmore gardening
tools in hand As they approach The House Jimmies eyes
widen He continues forward mouth agape as men in uniforms
carry boxes past him He stands frozen like a zombie

Mary cries into Terrys shoulder as a mover carries a box
down the front steps of The House Terry looks up to see
Jimmie and Montgomery with their tools and puts a hand up as
if to say not today boys

Jimmie turns to the nearest mover

JIMMIE
Excuse me what’s going on

He shrugs and trudges back to the house ARTURO sits in the
truck shaking his head upset Jimmie approaches cautiously

Jimmie looks back at Mary sobbing He glances up at the
massive house

MONTGOMERY
So what happens to it now

Jimmie stares at Mont

EXT HP PROJECTS - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING

Skateboard wheels roar against the pavement as Jimmie pounds
the concrete almost in tears

Montgomery runs alongside like a kid who never played sports
He glances at Jimmie wondering if hell slow down

Jimmies legs seem to double in speed as his mind races He
breaks his long stare to check on Montgomery Hes no longer
beside him He slows to a halt and looks back

Montgomery is kneeled over panting He points up

MONTGOMERY
WannaGetCandy

Jimmies eyes follow Montgomerys finger up the hill to a
line of people filing out of the door of a housing project
INT CANDY HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Jimmie and Montgomery stand in a line made up of mostly kids

LORETTA the proprietor of the makeshift store sits behind a
folding table with a cash box on her lap

EXT HP STREET CURB - AFTERNOON

Mont lays on the sidewalk chewing his candy with his mouth
open as Jimmie stares in his lap pensive A moment passes

ANDY ROY (0S)
Eraaay fuhck youu Jimbo

Jimmie slowly looks up to see ANDY ROY a weathered middle-
aged white skater covered in tats with his pal WHEATBERRY

He whisks past swinging a dead pigeon around like a lasso
JIMMIE
(under his breath)
Yeah fuck you back bra

Andy Roy chucks the pigeon at an advertisement

MONTGOMERY

made-over with a Hitler mustache devil horns and 666
sprayed across his forehead - now drips pigeon blood

Something clicks for Jimmie

INT REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DUSK

The realtor from the ad CLAYTON sits in a small brick
office A framed photo portrait of Ed Lee hangs on his wall
Neon from a bar below spills through his window

CLAYTON

Montgomery looks over at Jimmie

EXT THE HOUSE FRONT ALLEY BACKYARD - AFTERNOON - TRAVELLING

Jimmie and Mont stand silently staring up at the house All
traces of its former residents are gone save a pile of
newspapers Through the curtain-less windows the empty
parlor stares back unblinkingly at the young men

Jimmie exhales and starts towards the towering property
draped in fog He makes his way down the side alley Mont
following close behind

Jimmie pushes open a gate to the backyard revealing an
untended garden They face the back of the house

JIMMIE
Bra

A back door window is covered in faded stickers KEEP TAHOE
BLUE COEXIST IM WITH HER A Wiccan suncatcher dangles in
it

JIMMIE

Jimmie approaches the door He tries the knob - locked He
shoulders it - barely budges

He steps back checking the neighbors windows Montgomery
takes his place beside Jimmie They share a look We hear
nothing but Jimmies excited breath

They charge towards the door Upon impact WE CUT TO

INTTHE HOUSE MULTIPLE ROOMS - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

PARLOR - A SMASH echoes from the other side of the house A
curtain flutters from the distant impact The room is empty
Tomb-like Its vacancy heightens its magnificence

FRONT HALLWAY - Empty But the muffled sounds of new life -
rumbling footsteps and roused voices - creep closer through
the walls and ventilation

ATTIC - Still empty But the stomping grows louder breathing
more life into the creaking floorboards

LIBRARY - Laughter echoes off the walls The house is coming
alive

FRONT HALLWAY - Galumphing now thunders off the walls until -
SILENCE - Jimmie arrives in front of us

We slowly draw away from him Jimmie chases after us as if
pulled by the spirit of the house

He flies up the spiral staircase and sprints down the
hallway His foot catches a corner throwing him to the
ground THUD

MASTER BEDROOM - Jimmie rolls over onto his back blood
spilling from his lip as he laughs hysterically

As Jimmie catches his breath a faint voice approaches
outside He picks himself up and walks towards the window

A group of tourists on Segways stare up at the house through
the mist The crowd of expressionless faces look like an army
in matching tie-dye and helmets They circle their guide who
adjusts his helmet and begins his chalk talk

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
The other guides will rattle off
some stupid Summer of Love Grateful
Jefferson Quicksilverrrey But you
distinguished truth-seekers wanna
know about in the real hep-cats who
hung out here like James Baldwin
in his stylin’ ascots Here In the
Harlem of the West where Dizzie
and Miles would come play after
their white people gigs Where
Mayor Moscone got blowjobs from
black hookers Where Jim Jones
mixed his first cup of Kool Aid

A couple older tourists look to each other Their teen beams

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
Course ‘long comes Mayor Joe
Alioto spoiling all the fun
leveling the neighborhood in the
name of urban renewal Sorry about
your homes and your funky shops -
you can set up a shoe shine stand
in the Safeway parking lot

(he gasps for air)

And yet a few glorious homes
survived Il Duce’s wrecking ball
like this masterpiece dating clear
back to the 1800s

JIMMIE
(to himself)
Na bra

EXT BALCONY - Jimmie pushes the window open and steps out

TOUR GUIDE
Before the black stuff this was a
all Japanese ‘til FDR’s storm
troopers rounded em up into camps-

JIMMIE
(yelling)
This house was buuh-

Jimmie spits a mouthful of blood to the left of the tour

JIMMIE (CONTD)
Sorry-

He wipes his lip dry on his sleeve

JIMMIE (CONTD)
This was built in the 1940s

The tour guide looks quizzically up at Jimmie

TOUR GUIDE
(laughs )
Hey there amigo Uh huh- Lets wave
to our neighbor here everybody

A few group members tepidly wave he lowers his voice so
Jimmie wont hear Jimmie leans forward to listen

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
That would be about 100 years late
for this style We can see just
from his gingerbread trim this was
built sometime in the 1850s

JIMMIE

The tour guide smiles embarrassedly at his group

TOUR GUIDE
Hhhhm gonna have to disagree with
you there dudeman No architect in
the 1940s was building in this
style

JIMMIE
Thats probably true but this
house wasnt built by an architect
My grandpa built this

The group including the tour guide look up at the towering
piece of real estate with renewed curiosity

TOUR GUIDE JIMMIE (CONT’D)

Well I- He arrived in WWII bought this

lot and built this house The
stairs these windows the
columns the archways the witch
hat the balustrades the fish
scales the little spindles the
balcony the wall to keep y’all
the fuck out - all of it by
James Fails the First with his
own two hands in 1946

Jimmie looks like a king finally restored to his throne -
subjects at his feet framed in an ornate archway

A tubby man snaps a pic
The guide composes himself seeing hes lost his audience
TOUR GUIDE
Hm Thats pretty amazing Well on
we go to our next stop the closet
Patty Hearst willfully hid herself
in

Jimmie smiles proudly as they flee He turns

Mont leans against a wall of the Master Bedroom smiling

INT THE HOUSE PARLOR - NIGHT

The young men huddle around the orange glow of the fireplace
roasting hot dogs The crackling fire almost feels like a
beating heart Their long phantom shadows climb the high
empty walls behind them

MONTGOMERY
Its a beautiful house Jim

Jimmie takes that in knowing Mont wouldnt just say it
MONTGOMERY
More beautiful than I could have
imagined
JIMMIE
Yeah Not there yet but almost
INT THE HOUSE MULTIPLE ROOMS - MORNING

ATTIC - Jimmie lays on the floor of the witch hat pensive
He stares up at the circular tower’s woodwork He rises

He glides through the attic like a kid on Christmas morning
his flannel worn open like a robe He looks up at its steep
ceilings remembering what was and imagining what could be

FRONT HALLWAY - Jimmie runs his hand along the wood paneling
of the staircase

PARLOR - Jimmie stands under an archway blue and green light
hits his face

JIMMIE
Mont wake up

Montgomery starts to wake and looks up at Jimmie

MONTGOMERY
Your hairit fits the archway
like a puzzle piece

JIMMIE
Telling you bro I belong here

ATTIC - Back inside the empty witch hat Jimmie’s minds eye
twirls upwards towards the ceiling

We cut to VHS FOOTAGE of

A man clinging to a witch hat as it twirls upwards through
the sky After a moment we see a construction crane is
lifting the man and the witch hat higher and higher

GRANDPA (VO)
And what’s happening now

JIMMIE (VO)
He’s flying through the air

GRANDPA (VO)
C’mon now

JIMMIE (VO)
He’s flying through the air

GRANDPA (VO)
Jimmie your Grandpa was a Godly
man but he did not have super
powers

INT MONTGOMERYS LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Jimmie Montgomery and Montgomery’s Grandpa sit on the couch

enraptured by the old home movie Jimmie looks excited to be
the narrator for once

JIMMIE
He’s on a crane it’s hauling him
and the witch hat way high up

GRANDPA
Wait You got video of that day

JIMMIE
Yeah my dad filmed it

GRANDPA
Hm

The witch hat - and Jimmie’s Grandpa - are lowered until they
attach to the top of “The House” Claps and cheers rise from
a crowd below Jimmie’s grandpa waves from up high

JIMMIE
Wait How do you pause - I think I
saw Willie Mays

GRANDPA
Willie No this was after that

Montgomery looks up from his crossword puzzle

MONTGOMERY
Willie Mays was at the house

GRANDPA
Mhm Willie came and paid his
respects like we all did Youd get
here and youd go see Pastor Jimmie
Fails the first black man in San
Francisco”

Jimmie tries to hide a proud smile On screen his grandpa
looks almost mythical as he descends back down to Earth

GRANDPA
Takes a lot of charisma to let
people call you that But he wasnt
far off

Jimmie looks over at a shelf with photo albums
JIMMIE
Mr Allen I was also wondering can

I borrow that one picture

GRANDPA
Sure son I aint looking at it

Jimmie shoots Montgomery an excited look

INT FORREST HILL STATION - MORNING

Tiled walls reverberate with the guitar strums of a greying
black man his case open for coin Hes turned the Top 40 emo
ballad How to Save a Life into melancholic folk Perhaps he
loves the song Perhaps he knows his audience

Beside him a half-sleeping spanger holds a sign that reads
I Ued To 1iVe here SF nAtive

Jimmie and Montgomery enter frame and carry us beyond the
busker A generous goon drops a bill in his case His music
echoes on as we follow them down a long tunnel past a
homeless family and droves of desperate masses

EXT BART SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING

The BART train howls Jimmie sits in the window beside
Montgomery holding a crumpled BandW photo In it - a dapper
young Grandpa Allen hugs a man that must be Jimmies
grandfather in an elegantly decorated room

JIMMIE
Thats gonna be us in a few hours

We pull wide as the train shoots past cookie cutter homes and
rolling sun scorched hills Were not in Frisco anymore

EXT WANDA’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

A concrete ceiling A cloudless blue floor The young men
walk into view along an upside-down suburban street

A shirtless kid lies on his back across the street his head
hanging upside down just off the curb A pink lowrider
rumbles past The kid flips over to reorient himself

Jimmie and Montgomery now right-side up approach a pebble-
dashed single story home Jimmie knocks on the screen door A
cow moos from the hill beyond the house

WANDA
Oh Jimmie Jimmie Jimmie Jimmie

WANDA a middle-aged woman in a bolo tie and hoop earrings
yanks open the door to hug Jimmie She rocks him back and
forth then holds him at arms length to get a good look

WANDA

EXT WANDAS FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER

A handsome Asian man RICKY skates back and forth on in the
street on Jimmie’s board

Jimmie and Wanda sit in vintage lawn chairs Wanda in a
chaise lounge Montgomery sprawls on the dead lawn beside
them pulling grass Wanda cools herself with a battery
powered fan They’re sweaty overdressed for the burbs

JIMMIE
Man he better not break my board

WANDA
You should be telling him thank

board

(looks at Ricky lusty)
Besides sometimes it’s nice just
to watch Ricky do that trick you

Ricky crouches to do an ollie and lands it
Jimmie studies Wanda’s swoon

JIMMIE

WANDA

Ricky eats shit He looks over at Wanda with a boyish shrug
She looks at him lustily a spark reignited

34 INT WANDAS GARAGE - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER

Wanda opens a garage door revealing leaning boxes and
precious keepsakes The room is a treasure trove

Jimmie lifts a gorgeous red rug revealing chest with old
robes and thrown-like chairs He salivates

JIMMIE
Damn I knew you had some of it
but is this everything

WANDA
Everything your dad didn’t smoke
up
Jimmie nods
WANDA
Sorry hun that came out a little
harsh
JIMMIE

Jimmie lifts what appears to be an old champagne bottle
accidentally revealing a hidden cigarette dispenser within A
fan of old yellowed Marlboros blossom out

JIMMIE
Woah Thats mainey

WANDA
I always had a feeling - out of the
family youd be the one to come
looking for this stuff

JIMMIE
Whats that

Jimmie walks towards a round table with a mic and headphones
beside a Tiffany lamp

WANDA
Oh thats my own little thing From

a DJ

JIMMIE

WANDA
Yeah and its a nice way to get to

Jimmie bats his lashes coyly

WANDA
Psh he doesnt mind right Ricky

Ricky shrugs obligingly

RICKY
Be nice to move somebody back for
once

EXT HIGHWAY 4 - SUNSET - TRAVELING
We hear nothing but a microphone crackling Then bubbles

Jimmie and Montgomery sit in the back of a stake bed truck
with chicken wire walls surrounded by unique furniture

Golden light strikes the rows of crops as they fly by The
clean lines dance in perfect rhythm one after the next

JANE (VO)
Sometimes after a long day I like
to come home and put my head
against Ponchys chest
(giggles)
And when he takes a sip of beer I
can hear the bubbles um bubbling

WANDA (VO)
Mhm please thank Ponchy for
letting us put a mic on his tummy

We hear the women laugh as the bubbles fizz and pop
Ricky smiles as if hearing Wandas laugh makes him miss her

WANDA (VO)
And whos this we have here

A dog snores loudly

JANE (VO)
Well Pepper only snores like this
when shes tuckered out from a long
hike So that usually makes me feel
good like we had an eventful day

Ricky leans back and slides open the cab window He shouts
but we can barely hear him

RICKY
How yall doing back there

Jimmie stares out mesmerized by the miles of farmland
Montgomery gives a thumbs up his hair rippling in the wind

JANE (VO)
I suppose most of the sounds I
like are probably pretty regular

WANDA (VO)
(in a punch-in)
Far from it Today were joined by
our wonderful neighbor Jane from
Pine St And now I encourage you to
listen to the sounds of your home

The truck disappears into the distance

INTEXT THE HOUSE MULTIPLE ROOMS - NIGHT

2ND FLOOR BUTLER STAIR - The sound of floorboards creaking
Ricky Jimmie and Mont walk up the noisy steps hands full of
furniture

MASTER BATHROOM - The sound of rumbling pipes Jimmie turns
on a sink His eyes track the sound of flowing water through
the walls until water gushes out of the faucet

CONSERVATORY - The sound of a flame catching Jimmie lights
the gas sconce with a match The hallway illuminates with a
warm yellow glow

LIBRARY - The sound of an old ticking clock Mont inspects
the title of a book then slides it into a shelf by an old
exposed clock

FRONT HALLWAY - The sound of a thunderous pipe organ Jimmie
plays an organ built into the walls Dust shoots out of the

pipes
PARLOR - Mont runs a finger along the beads of a glass lamp

ATTIC - The sound of wind howling and windows shaking Ricky
peels away waving bye to the young men through the window

EXT “THE HOUSE” - All the sounds culminate in a full chorus
Its as if the skeleton of the house - now filled with
furniture and people - has pulsing organs and blood pumping
through it A toilet flushes

Montgomery picks up the final furniture off the street and
starts towards the house

MONTGOMERY
So Ricky never lived here eh

JIMMIE
Nah Wanda was in this rock
climbing phase dating this white
dude

Jimmie begins to lift a rug when he notices TIM ELLORY - a
retired cashmere liberal with remnants of a Connecticut
accent - across the street Tim surveys the scene trying not
to stare while his dog poops

Jimmie trots down the steps and towards the man with warm
purpose Tim looks up surprised

JIMMIE
Hi sir Im Jimmie Fails we
havent yet had the chance to meet

Jimmie wipes his dusty hand and extends it Tim takes it
instinctively Jimmie shakes as if sealing a deal

JIMMIE

Welcome to the neighborhood
TIM ELLORY

A-ha ah yes Welcome Tim Tim

Ellory

Mid-shake Tim looks back at the house - a few pieces of
stunning antique furniture remain on the street while
Montgomery works away in the window

TIM ELLORY
Geez fast moving market huh I

JIMMIE
Didnt need to but look Tim - I

to be the best neighbor you ever
had

TIM ELLORY
Wellalright Jimmie Thank you

JIMMIE
My pleasure Youll have to pardon
me weve got lots to do

TIM ELLORY
Oh of course

Jimmie half-bows then jogs back across the street He grabs
an armful of furniture and carries it inside Tim looks on
slightly dazed as Jimmie joins Montgomery in the window
368

PARLOR - Their collection of furniture sits in the center of
the dark empty parlor like pirates treasure in a hollow
cave The young men study their bounty moving wrappers
strewn about like Christmas morning

INT THE HOUSE PARLOR - MORNING

Jimmie lies peacefully on the couch satin pillows crowning
his head

Mont lays on the floor on a slapdash bed of cushions and silk
sheets Both of them are draped in tapestry-turned-comforters
with matching wildlife landscapes

Silence

JIMMIE
I’m gonna drink my coffee and
scratch my ass while I read the
paper

MONTGOMERY
You don’t even read the paper

JIMMIE

A hint of excitement enters Montgomerys face

MONTGOMERY
You think this can be really be our
home

Silence

JIMMIE

it secret and lie you know

MONTGOMERY

JIMMIE

Montgomery watches from across the street captivated by the
theatrically of the tableau Through his eyes it looks like
a stage production

Fists slap together

Mouths hurl slurs and saliva

A pair of eyes cry angrily

NITTY

approaches Nitty

like a theater director We scan their confused faces He
arrives at Kofi

MONTGOMERY

Montgomery lingers for a moment then marches back across the
street

MONTGOMERY
Keep building it

belt He touches up the gold paint he can now finally reach

INT THE HOUSE BUTLER’S STAIRS - AFTERNOON

Jimmie stands at the bottom of a grand but worn-out
staircase He sips coffee from a mug

JIMMIE
When you drop in bra lean back

At the top of steps Montgomery stands awkwardly on Jimmies
skateboard He precariously leans over the top step where
wooden planks have been laid to make a path down the stairs

INT THE HOUSE CONSERVATORY - AFTERNOON

Jimmie carefully peels away old wallpaper revealing long-
hidden wood beneath Montgomery lays crumpled on the floor
dusty and scraped up from his tumble He scratches away glue
residue from the wall groaning

JIMMIE
Bruh it’s still not separating

MONTGOMERY
(groaning)

JIMMIE

Jimmie shakes his head smiling

EXT THE AMBASSADOR SRO - AFTERNOON

A black HOMELESS OPERA SINGER belts O mio babbino caro in
perfect Italian His booming voice almost drowns out a couple
fighting down the street A strung-out man dances along

Jimmie watches transfixed Instead of his signature flannel
and black beanie hes wearing the goon clothes hed tried on
in Montgomerys mirror

Jimmie stashes his board in a bush beside the singer and gives
him a dollar He crosses the street into a brick building

We tilt up the building to the 13th floor A man sits in the
window like a deposed king banished to some sequestered
tower He watches the little people scurry about as he spits
sunflower seeds at the world below

INT THE AMBASSADOR SRO - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER

Jimmie flips through pirated DVDs in cellophane bags The
homemade labels read UNDER SIEGE CLIFFHANGER THE PATRIOT

different voice than weve heard him use with Montgomery

They fall back into silence Jimmie picks up the scissors and
starts cutting the labels

JAMES SR
Go on and get Messing up my day

Jimmie stares at him frozen
JAMES SR
Go on
EXT FILLMORE BUS STOP - AFTERNOON

Jimmie sits despondent at a bus stop his mind still
replaying the conversation as his leg restlessly taps away

A gentleman with a grey pony tail and orange skin enters
frame With the exception of tennis shoes a backpack and a
lei around his beck he is completely naked He puts a toilet
seat cover on the seat next to Jimmie and sits down

Jimmie is unfazed - he’s seen this a million times

NAKED MAN
Excuse me have you been waiting

(vacantly)

Hella long bro I might just

INT THE HOUSE PARLOR - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Kofi shifts in a stiff Victorian chair He looks over Jimmie
a little confused by his blood-stained goon clothes
Montgomery smiles politely Flower arrangements plucked from
neighbors gardens sprinkle the room

None of them quite know how to act under these foreign
circumstances All three have beer in mismatched glass
chalices
An eerie creaking sound comes from upstairs Kofi looks
around the candlelit room

KOFI

INT THE HOUSE PARLOR and DINING ROOM - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

As if pulled by some spirit Montgomery floats forward His
eyes catch the corners of various rooms as he ambles forward

Jimmie stands on a chair in the background fiddling with an
electrical box He flips a nob and the room lights up with a
warm glow

Montgomery enters the dining room his head turned up at the
heavens It’s his very own Sistine Chapel paintings of
colorful birds spread their wings across the ceiling

MONTGOMERY
Is this one okay

JIMMIE (0S)
YeahI mean you sure you want

Montgomery nods to himself taking it all in He begins to
measure the wall with his wingspan muttering calculations

MONTGOMERY

54 INT MONTGOMERYS BEDROOM HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Montgomery wearing an old werewolf mask sorts through props
and costumes Only a few tools remain hanging on his once-
covered walls the rest packed away in scattered milk crates
He begins organizing metal pulleys and clews into a crate
with other stage rigging materials

In the next room Jimmie paces back and forth on the phone

JIMMIE (0S)
No the power’s been on I just need

Grandpa enters the phone cord hitting his chest He lifts it
and feels his way into Montgomerys room

JIMMIE (0S)

MONTGOMERY
He already pays half Grandpa

Catcalls from the Greek Chorus fail to land on Montgomery
head cocked listening fascinated He pushes a cart full of
crates various prop hats stacked atop his head

FRESH

Jimmie hauls a chest of Montgomerys gear shaking his head

INT THE HOUSE CONSERVATORY and KITCHEN - NIGHT

An expressive sketch of the Greek Chorus captures the joyous
moment they humiliated someone Kofi standing front and
center Montgomerys hand enters and plucks out the
Rockwellian pencil shading on FRESH

Jimmie stands in an old robe at the corner whisking eggs with
a fork He watches Montgomery

JIMMIE
Youre really drawing themAll

Jimmie watches Montgomery sip a beer and continue sketching

JIMMIE
Well why did you hang out with me

He grabs a chewed-up pencil from his crate of art supplies

JIMMIE
You really don’t give a fuck what
anybody says

MONTGOMERY
I shouldnt get to appreciate them
just cuz they’re mean to me That
seems silly

Jimmie furrows his brow confused He looks up and sees a
neighbor through the window whisking eggs in her kitchen He
studies the middle-aged woman in her robe

JIMMIE
Let’s go out

Dreamy sweeping strings appear

MONTAGE FILLMORE PEOPLE-WATCHING - NIGHT

EXT VR WINDOW - Jimmie and Mont sit in the dark sipping
40s of beer They peer into a window as if watching tv

A man in a VR helmet and underwear reaches blindly in an
empty room After a lonely moment a girl steps into view
wearing a matching helmet and oversized shirt They swat at
virtual predators finally bumping into each other They rip
off the masks and laugh hysterically

EXT SPLIT WINDOW - Two young women sit on opposite sides of
a converted bedroom split down the middle by a hanging bed
sheet Woman 1s yoga routine is interrupted by a knock at
the door A man enters her side tiptoes past her ducks
under the sheet-wall and embraces Woman 2

JIMMIE (0S)
Bro thats supposed to be a living
room

Jimmie and Montgomery study the respective sides of the
girls mantle each with differing decorations

JIMMIE
They wouldve done the same shit to
our house Putting 5 people ina
room

MONTGOMERY
Were quite fortunate

They clink bottles

EXT HOUSE PARTY WINDOW - A large Victorian pulses with the
vibrations of music and the energy of millennials A man
dances in a corner window His gaze catches Jimmie and
Montgomery ogling from outside He smiles and waves them in

The young men tipsily look around alarmed someone has caught
their peeping They look back up at the house

Partygoers hang over the second story balcony A couple sit
on a fire escape legs dangling throwing feathers

Jimmie finishes his bottle The duo and walk into towards
camera until their bodies black out the frame They step
through the other side into the world theyd been watching
INT HOUSE PARTY MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Jimmie and Montgomery enter the house passing various
partygoers

They stop and watch a man with Robert-Plant-hair and musical-
theater-gusto hand-dances and sing to a song playing
overhead

Jimmie stares at him eyes glazed Montgomery grabs a bottle
off the shelf and swigs it looking around

INT HOUSE PARTY ANTLER ROOM - NIGHT
SERENA a Berkeley girl conceived to Paul Simon nods

JIMMIE
You know the wallpaper on the
outside wall is hella harder to
remove because it’s moist like
condensation but then when you
finally do you see they used WHITE
glue Like fucking Elmer’s Like
what was the thought process

SERENA
Yeah no idea

JIMMIE
Yeah I know But if you wanted to
have a tour that would be fun

SERENA
Sounds good - I’m gonna bring these
drinks You’re welcome to come -

JIMMIE
Yeah if that’s cool

Jimmie reaches for the beer cups she’s filled
JIMMIE (CONTD)
Sorry I’m talking about this house
It’s stupid I’m just kinda excited
about it

They walk off revealing a pomade-preened guy explaining
Hyphy lingo to a skeptical collegiate black woman

A trans man and his bubbly friend share a sarcastic toast

INT HOUSE PARTY KITCHEN - NIGHT

Serena sits on a counter by her friend BILLY an
intellectual stoner in his grandpa’s PJs and Sam a sweet-
faced dude holding a huge stein of beer

Jimmie stands awkwardly at the edge of the group

SERENA
She’s this beautiful vivacious
person dating so many cunty guys
It’s like don’t blame the
messenger I’m just trying to help

JIMMIE
That’s shitty

Serena turns to him politely

SERENA
Yeah it’s hella shitty

BILLY
But if it’s a self esteem issue
what really can you do

SERENA
I mean I told her I’m pretty sure
I told her- you can sleep with Sam
if you want

Sam nods sheepishly Jimmie looks confused

A cheer from outside catches Jimmie’s attention He looks out
the window overlooking the backyard

Amidst a small crowd three young bros violently yank at a
small pine tree It sways back and forth as they wrestle it

BILLY
So the thinking is you have sex
with someone whose not shitty once-

Jimmie watches out the window a little shocked

SERENA
Exactly And then your bar is like
too high for those cunty roadies
and untalented comedian guys

A few onlookers outside egg on the men struggling with the
sapling Suddenly Jimmie appears in frame He piles on and
begins yanking with them to the rising cheers of the crowd

EXT HOUSE PARTY BACKYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Jimmie looks excited to be a part of this team With his

the root clump into the ground in an explosion of dirt

His frantic dancing slows as he drunkenly notices the
branches dragging through the living room

Jimmie walks up the steps to the House Mont remains frozen

INT THE HOUSE ATTIC - DAWN

Jimmie lies on his newly-assembled bed He looks small
underneath the steep towering walls alone for the first
night in longer than he can remember

His minds wanders to Serena and he slips his hand under the
sheets Loud drilling and strange space-jazz burst through

the shaking walls from Montgomerys room He pulls his hand
out from the sheets and turns to sleep

INT THE HOUSE CONSERVATORY - MORNING

Jimmie looks out the window at nothing but fog

JIMMIE
(to himself)
Thick as fuck today

EXT THE HOUSE BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
A deep hole in the ground looks like a shallow grave
Jimmie crouches above it digging - his sleeves rolled up
biceps covered in dirt cig hanging from his lip Montgomery
hung over sprawls under the newly planted tree

Jimmie shakes his head as he digs

JIMMIE
We need fertilizer shits dying

Montgomery groans

EXT “THE HOUSE” FRONT STEPS - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING

Jimmie and Mont carry bags overflowing with asters in bloom
They climb the first flight of stairs and come to a halt

Mary Zwigott the previous resident sits on the front steps
of the house She looks lifeless

Montgomery looks to Jimmie unsure if they should run
An almost haunted wind catches the fringe of Mary’s blouse
and howls through the trees Mary shakes her head at the
memory of her old foe
JIMMIE
(cautiously)
Hey What are you doing here

Mary’s exhaustion gives way to a resigned half-smile

MARY
What are you ever doing here

Jimmie looks nervous His eyes drift to the house

JIMMIE
Uh- didnt you move out though

Mary looks past Jimmie at Montgomery who stands holding the
flower bags like an idiot

MARY
Yeah They changed the locks on me

She studies Jimmie’s young face It’s the first time she’s
really looked at him

MARY (CONTD)
What do you want man

JIMMIE
I’m sorry That sucks

Mary softens a little

JIMMIE (CONTD)
How long are you going to be here

MARY

JIMMIE

Jimmie nods to Montgomery who lifts the bags Mary eyes their
tools and chuckles to herself

MARY

They turn and walk away
MARY (CONTD)
In this crazy fucking city you’re

INT BUS - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING

The young men sit in the back of the bus their colorful
flowers beside them

MONTGOMERY
You think shes gonna stay there
all night

JIMMIE
Watch bra Well come back and
shell be painting the windowsill
Jimmie glances around the bus
Loretta’s former flame with the fez winks at Jimmie
Further down two oily street kids with white-people-dreads

and camping backpacks sprawl across the seats Their pit bull
forces its snout into the girls lap
Jimmies nose crinkles as the dog sniffs her crotch with
increasing fervor The street kids dont seem to notice

A group of people shuffle off and on the bus

BRENDA (0S)
(into phone)

Jimmie and Montgomery exit

EXT MONTGOMERYS HOUSE - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

The bus doors open Through the fog we slowly start to

see

two worried pedestrians whisper in hushed tones as they walk

off Mont and Jimmie look at them concerned
691

At Monts house candles flowers and the Greek Chorus are
gathered bleary-eyed and dejected on their slab of concrete

They avoid eye contact with one another trying to mask their
tears Their matching necklaces hold freshly laminated photos
of Kofi with the caption RIP KOFI

Jimmie and Montgomery freeze They stare at the Greek Chorus
first in shocked confusion then in horror

JIMMIE

Stunna approaches Jimmie eyes angry Jimmie tenses up
protectively

Stunna wraps Jimmie into a hug so hard the flower bag falls
out of Jimmies hand Jimmie stares off expressionless

INT MONTGOMERYS LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Jimmie and Montgomery sit on the couch lifeless Grandpa
sits facing the open window where mourners can be heard

GRANDPA
That poor boy And his mother-

A moment passes

GRANDPA

They look to Grandpa their bodies frozen
GRANDPA

GRANDPA
Ok Alright I’m fine

INTEXT MONTGOMERYS BEDROOM - DUSK

Through the window we see Nitty under the foggy streetlight
He stands spiritlessly on his slab

Beside him a trail of dark soil from Jimmies flower bag
lays tossed like an arching brushtroke Nothing can be heard
but the loud thrum of crickets

Montgomery sits in his bed looking out at Nitty stand alone
Jimmie sits on the floor where his cot once was

WANDA (VO)
Were listening to the sounds of
crickets behind Bill and Sue
Selbys home Something cozy about
them - lets listen in
The crickets continue

Jimmie turns to Montgomery

Mont scrolls through his phone looking at the RIP messages
on Kofi’s wall

Mont turns to Jimmie

MONTGOMERY
I was writing a play about him you
know

JIMMIE

You don’t have to stop now
Mont nods to Jimmie
JIMMIE (CONTD)
I know it sounds weird but I feel

Mont looks out the window

Nitty stands alone on the corner by the vigil alone

Music begins as-

MONTAGE HUNTERS POINT

INT GUNNA’S HOUSE - In the late evening Gunna consoles his
son Darrel as he tucks him into bed

INT BOBBYS CAR - In the dead of night Bobby plays
solitaire as he listens to the radio His girlfriend smokes

INT PREACHERS HOME - In the early hours of the morning the
Preacher adjusts his bow tie in front of the mirror

EXT HP SHIPYARDS - The Preacher walks down a desolate street
under an orange sky He places his soap box in the middle of
the frame He steps on top takes a deep breath and just as
he opens his mouth-

EXT THE HOUSE - MORNING

JIMMIE
FUCK

Jimmie and Montgomery stand on the sidewalk in front of “The
House” which is now littered with his grandpas furniture
Every last piece from inside lies scattered on the concrete
like tossed trash from a spurned lover

Jimmie lifts a broken chair a few shattered splinters barely
hold it together

MONTGOMERY
Oh god

Jimmie mechanically starts problem-solving collecting dewy
cushions from the sidewalk and tossing them on the couch

JIMMIE
Howd she toss all our shit

He lifts the last cushion to find his cigarette-dispenser
broken He clutches its remains in his hand

MONTGOMERY
I dont think it was her

Jimmie follows Montgomerys worried gaze to a FOR SALE sign
with Claytons face printed on it smiling back at him

JIMMIE
FuckingTraitor

He storms over and kicks the sign with all his might
Pamphlets fly everywhere

He stares at the advertisement Something in him changes

JIMMIE
Okay Okay

He turns back to the strewn furniture and yanks open a
toppled set of drawers and pulls out a dark burgundy suit

Jimmie starts off Montgomery follows

JIMMIE
Could you stay and watch the shit

Jimmie drops his board and skates off like a cowboy
Montgomery turns to the orphaned property

He leans down to right a lamp and notices a tossed pamphlet

He picks it up and inspects it His brow furrows

INT SAN FRANCISCO BANK - AFTERNOON

Jimmie sits antsy wearing the burgundy suit that was clearly
tailored to the larger figure of his grandfather He taps his
shoes against the cold marble and looks across at a Latino
man in a JC Penney suit hammering away at a keyboard

INT REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DUSK

CLAYTON
OK OK you got me YOU WIN You

Clayton fake-laughs into his phone and looks over to
Montgomery who sits across from him Montgomerys eyes
wander anxiously around the messy office Clayton hangs up

CLAYTON
Hows it going man

MONTGOMERY
Fine sir I noticed the house wed
discussed is now for sale

Clayton leans back his seat his eyes narrow

MONTGOMERY
There were some alarming things in
your literature I thought you might
want to know And certainly the
Bureau of Real Estate would

CLAYTON
Uh huh

Montgomery steadies his shaking hand and raises the
pamphlet

MONTGOMERY
This says the property has a view
of the Golden Gate Which I dont
think is true well it isnt

Claytons brow furrows

MONTGOMERY
It also claims to have all original
fixtures floors and faucets

Clayton nods slowly

MONTGOMERY
And are you planning on disclosing
theres no septic Fresh So any day
now the garden could be flooded
withshit

CLAYTON
Wheres this going man

MONTGOMERY
Well together this seems like
false advertising which is grounds
to void a sale Potentially revoke
a license Perhaps it isn’t worth
it to you to take this on

CLAYTON
I thought it mightve been you

guys

MONTGOMERY
Excuse me

CLAYTON
Whats your deal man

MONTGOMERY
I don’t have a deal

CLAYTON
Look someone else on this floor

Montgomery tries his best to stare down Clayton and hide his
nervous hands under the table

CLAYTON

couldve had it trucked off but I
left it out for you guys

MONTGOMERY

CLAYTON

very old document

Clayton tosses Jimmies electric bill across the table
CLAYTON
I know your name I dont want to

that to you

Montgomery stares at Clayton shell-shocked

EXT THE HOUSE - NIGHT

Montgomery arrives home to find the furniture is gone All
that remains is the couch upside-down Mont climbs over it
and looks up

Jimmie sits like a gargoyle on the front porch rail above -
soaked in sweat He tranquilly smokes

Montgomery climbs the last step He studies Jimmie

MONTGOMERY
Where’d you go

JIMMIE
Doesnt even matter bra I got
everything inside except the

couch Shit fell on me
Jimmie laughs darkly Montgomery looks concerned

MONTGOMERY
Jim I spoke to the realtor-

back

The pocket doors slide open behind him

As the acapella voices compete for the last note we pull
back to see chairs now arranged in precise rows

DING-DONG-DING-DONG

JIMMIE (0S) (CONTD)
Shit Hella fucking early

Jimmie carries us down the stairs towards the front door The
house looks better than it ever has in near museum condition
INTEXT THE HOUSE MULTIPLE ROOMS - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
Through stained glass with a crest of a “T” we see Jimmie’s
dad standing in the doorway Hes wearing his nice clothes a
roomy green suit and a Stetson hat

Jimmie opes the door

JAMES SR
Why you dressed up like a whiteboy

Jimmie looks down at his regular outfit James Sr can see he
caught his son off guard and pivots

JAMES SR
Oh it’s for your little show huh

JIMMIE
Uh yeah

He looks past Jimmie and makes his way inside for the first
time in years

JAMES SR
Man

He peaks in the parlor nodding to himself as he struts
aided by his cane

Montgomery emerges from the basement with a chair upholstery
still ripped from having been tossed on the sidewalk

JAMES SR
You mess up my daddys chair Mont-
gum-ery

MONTGOMERY

Oh no sir Were was a
Montgomery looks to Jimmie for help

JAMES SR
You got stage fright huh

James Sr passes Montgomery patting his shoulder

JAMES SR
I dont care about the chair son

He walks down the hall and sits down at the organ He yanks a
few knobs and begins playing something resembling Bootsy
Collins’ “I’d Rather Be With You” He stops and smiles

JAMES SR
My daddy hated when I played that
shit
INT THE HOUSE MAIN STAIRCASE - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

James Sr sits studying the staircase railing He runs his
cane across the wood

Below Mont welcomes in Tim Ellory and his wife holding a
flier The couple make their way upstairs taking a moment
drink in the home they’ve only ever seen from outside

James Sr

JAMES SR
Come on in don’t be shy His
grandpa built this Not bad for a
black man huh

TIM ELLORY
Oh no very good very good

chuckles proudly as the couple passes

JIMMIE

JAMES SR

James turns to another group admiring the architecture as

they pass

James Sr

JAMES SR

chuckles to his son

JIMMIE

Figured I should come see how this
was all working out though I know

James Sr’s eyes float to the front hall below Jimmie turns
to follow his gaze

Wanda stands looking at a framed photo she gave Jimmie In
it Grandpa Fails theatrically holds a hammer for camera by
the front step

Wanda looks up She sees the men and inhales deeply

WANDA
Wellthe two James

JAMES SR
(lifting himself)
Ahh Miss Wa-Wa How you doing

Wanda ascends the staircase

WANDA
Fine - you look good James

JAMES SR

She reaches them and scoops the men into a hug In his
family’s arms Jimmie melts

Curtains up in 10

Nobody moves

INT THE HOUSE ATTIC - AFTERNOON

An eclectic audience fills the makeshift theatre Wanda
introduces herself to Andy Roy and Gunna Tim Ellory
pontificates to Bobby who think hes kidding the hand dancer
teaches Gunnas children air guitar New faces fill the gaps
between those weve met

The audience falls silent as the lights drop The curtains
creep open to reveal an eerie blue spotlight on Montgomery

He stands in profile dressed exactly like Kofi - oversized t-
shirt Jordans and fake ducktails in his hair

Behind him a diorama of his street in Hunters Point Soft
sounds of the harbor play from a speaker

Montgomery suddenly springs to life

MONTGOMERY (AS KOFI)

Montgomery flips 180 degrees revealing hes in two-face The
second half of his costume is a replica of Nitty

MONTGOMERY (AS NITTY)

Montgomery flips 180 degrees back to Kofis profile

MONTGOMERY (AS KOFI)

Jimmie enters dressed as Death a long black robe ends at his
white skeletal make-up He slips behind a bush then a
mailbox ever closer

Kofi erupts wailing at the air wildly

MONTGOMERY (AS KOFI)

Lights drop on HP leaving Kofi alone in the spotlight
MONTGOMERY (AS KOFI)

jumps at the sound effect and white strobe flash BANG -
Another flash They disappear

The curtains widen to reveal that the choir is made up of all
the street musicians weve met throughout the film

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
(top of his lungs)
Mr Tuck MOVED to FLORIDA 10 years
ago They share ONE mutual friend
His post links to a song called
NETFLIX AND PILLS ARE THESE THE
PEOPLE THAT KNEW KOFI

More Facebook posts appear on screen flicking on and off too
fast to fully read The choir softens into a funereal hum

Montgomery steps forward slowly making eye contact with each
person in the room as the house lights fade up on them

In the audience the Preacher looks touched

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
Kofi had more dimensions than a
POST could reflect Or a PLAY could
capture So I summon YOU Celebrate
the life he lived not through
those who SPEAK loudest but by the
memories he LEFT US ALL- MA’AM

Montgomery points to Loretta His voice softens

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
- how will you remember Kofi

Loretta hesitates for a moment unsure of whether or not to
speak Montgomery nods encouragingly and Loretta stands

LORETTA
Kofi was a good kid He used to
walk my niece home when she first
moved out here He kept his hands
to himself He was always a little
gentleman I wish hed had more
time-

Lorettas eyes begin to tear as she looks at her sons Unable
to continue she takes a seat

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
And what about you sir

Montgomery points to Andy Roy Andy stands wipes his face

ANDY ROY
Kofi man On a board he was a
natural A lotta people gotta work
for it but he had it He’d like
olley the Gonz gap He’ll be
missed

Montgomery nods and turns to Tim Ellory who blushes

TIM ELLORY
Oh I I never knew him

Montgomery turns to Wanda beside him She regretfully shakes
her head as well Montgomery turns to his Grandpa

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
And you Grandpa Allen

Bobby nudges Grandpa to alert him Hes already aware

GRANDPA
Well I coached Kofi in Pop Warner
Hed stay behind to help me pack up
every day never made a fuss Only
boy who ever did that

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
And you my friend

Montgomery points at Jimmie who has snuck into the middle of
the audience Jimmie stands

JIMMIE
My last memory of Kofi is him
talking shit to me He said some of
most fucked up shit anybody ever
said to me But Kofi also got
jumped for defending me from older
kids at our group home He didn’t
like to fight and he fought for me
then People aren’t one thing

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
THAT All of it

Montgomery turns to his congregation smiling proudly

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
What would’ve happened if Kofi had
the chance to show himself All
forms of himself

Nobody answers

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
The world had a box for him And he
never pushed beyond it
(scans the walls)
(MORE )

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER) (CONTD)
Perhapsif Kofi had grown up just
a few neighborhoods over - he
couldve been gentle And proud to
have been that

FRESH starts to tear up

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
But we arent gathered here solely
to mourn Let us break the boxes

Montgomery bangs his fist against the newly painted wall

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
Let us give each other the courage
to SEE and BE SEEN

He points at Loretta

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
YOU - Robin Hood of sweets

He points at Wandas husband Ricky

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
YOU - once-jailed activist

He whips a finger up at Jimmie

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
And YOU You Jimmie are what is
great about this city Youre a
fantastic human A great friend

Jimmie self-consciously shifts as people look at him

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
Were here in this reborn relic
because of what this man has done

From Jimmies expression we can see Montgomery is off-script

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
Let us see him now Self-taught
historian carpenter master
decorator working class hero
lover of lost San Francisco friend
to all friends YOU You are seen
Let us really look at Jimmie Fails
the Third

The color drains from Jimmies face as those who havent
already turned to look at him shift in their seats
MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
And we dont NEED any of this to

see you This our little

tabernacle is but a place to
congregate today BUT tomorrow
you YOU EXIST beyond these walls

of your forefathers

He slams his hands against the walls cracking the wood The

whole audience jumps Jimmies jaw hardens
Montgomery smiles warmly at Jimmie as he approaches him
MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)

You exist In every form of
yourself You - you are not this

floor

Montgomery lifts the chair Jimmie just fixed and pounds it to

the floor for effect Its leg breaks rattling Montgomery

JIMMIE
Bra what are you doing

Montgomery freezes panting

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
You are not this house Jimmie
And and its time YOU KNOW

JIMMIE

I don’t need to know let’s stop

James Sr’s jaw clenches

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)
You extend beyond these wa-

JIMMIE

JIMMIE

MONTGOMERY (AS PREACHER)

Jimmie stares at Montgomery

JIMMIE
Yes he did He built this house

MONTGOMERY

JIMMIE

MONTGOMERY

Jimmie looks to everyone embarrassed He turns back to Mont
JIMMIE
You don’t get itI’m not fucking

Montgomery studies him confused

JIMMIE
Get outta here Mont

Montgomery’s confusion turns to shock
JIMMIE
I’m not any of those things Get

out of my house

Jimmie marches out of the room Chairs squeak as others begin
to rise slowly Montgomery stands there listless

INTEXT “THE HOUSE” MASTER BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Jimmie sits in the bay window watching the crowd spill out
onto the street

James Sr enters and playfully puts his dukes up to Jimmie
He softly faux-jabs Jimmie’s chin Jimmie doesn’t laugh

JAMES SR
What you in here watching TV

James’ gaze follows Jimmies to the people outside
JAMES SR
Man they dont deserve to be in

here anyway

JIMMIE
Neither do we

James Sr sucks his teeth and starts to roll a cigarette

JAMES SR
You gone really let some ol’ other
ass nigga tell you what’s true

James Sr smiles Jimmie doesnt

Jimmie finally turns to him He looks him in the eyes
searching

JIMMIE

Jimmie studies his father A range of emotions flash over
James Sr’s face

JAMES SR
Say what

JIMMIE
The truth I been knowing This
whole time I’m a liar just like
you Now you say it

James looks at his son naked

JAMES SR
Fuck outta here man

JIMMIE
Say it

After a moment James Sr lifts himself and passes his son

He staggers down the steps walks towards the front door and

pulls out the cigarette his hands trembling He lights it
with the same motion Jimmie does and opens the door to a
strong wind He exits

EXT THE HOUSE - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

James Sr clutches the collar of his coat bracing for the
wind Jimmie looks on from the window above

The last parcel of life has left the house Its emptiness
heightens its magnificence

INT THE HOUSE MULTIPLE ROOMS - AFTERNOON

Through archways windows and door frames - we see Jimmie
trapped between the walls that once gave him freedom

Jimmie skates through the deserted house his face
expressionless Down the hallway into the kitchen back into
the parlor and round the hallway again

Jimmie stops skating picks up his board and sends it
crashing into the door frame THWACK He screams as he swings
it harder On impact WE CUT TO

INT THE HOUSE DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Jimmie sits cradling the two splintery halves of his board
Montgomery’s unfinished room stares back at him tools and

rigs sit awkwardly on the ornate shelving

SQUEAK The gate outside swings shut Jimmie turns his head

INTEXT THE HOUSE MULTIPLE ROOMS and BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

Jimmie walks down the long hallway ears piqued - he can hear
footsteps in the brush He arrives at the back door

Wanda is leaned over something in the backyard

WANDA
This is the sound of my hands
through - well I guess these are
asters now Used to be tulips

Jimmie watches his Aunt take a deep breath
JIMMIE
(whispering)

Auntie

She turns to see him bleary-eyed and dejected

EXT THE HOUSE BACKYARD - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER
Wanda and Jimmie sit in silence in the yard

JIMMIE
(softly)
I been telling people he built it
so long I almost forgot it wasn’t
true
Jimmie’s barely has any voice left

WANDA
You were telling your truth Jayboe
You were just lying to do it

Wanda flashes a sad smile and looks up at the house

WANDA (CONTD)
This was ours And then it wasn’t
So you just tell yourself whatever
you need to feel like it still is
right We all did that But you got
a chance to get out from underneath
that now

JIMMIE
I don’t want to I just want it

WANDA
Yeah I know I seen your daddy
build his whole life around that
around some story we got told when
we were kids Shit I did too
Makes you feel good Feel special
I don’t think your grandpa even
took it that serious to be honest
Folks back then didn’t really care
if it was true or not Just made
them happy to have something to
aspire to

Wanda looks to Jimmie

WANDA (CONTD)
I’m hella proud of you though - you
almost made it real All this work
you did It’s incredible But you
gotta really ask yourself now if
you want that Spend your life here
working on this Fighting for this
Cause you could make this place
yours I believe you could But if
you leave its not your loss its
San Franciscos Thats how I think
about it anyways Fuck San
Francisco

WANDA

They hug

JIMMIE

for your next show

WANDA

Antioch

Jimmie hugs her harder
WANDA (CONTD)
Youre always welcome out there you

Jimmie nods remembering his sobering new reality

INT THE HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmie sits in a pool of gold light deep in thought He’s
surrounded by darkness

INT BUS - SUNRISE - TRAVELING

Jimmie sprawls across a seat still in a meditative state
San Francisco whirs past

Two voices cut through the rattling wheels

BECCA (0S)
No - it’s 5 dollars for coffee Not
some fancy triple foam ice-cream
shit Coffee Black

NINA (0S)
It’s absurd

Almost too broken to move Jimmie turns his head a few
degrees to look down the nearly empty car

BECCA and NINA two thirty-somethings in pencil skirts and
blouses are en route to work Nina applies foundation while
Becca stares into her coffee defeated

BECCA
Yeah but I need it to wake up at
5am to trek across town to temp
with a masters degree While my mom
pretends NOT to freak out

NINA
Ugh can we go back to New York
already

BECCA

The girls turn to Jimmie caught off guard He remains
slumped

JIMMIE
You dont get to hate San

JIMMIE

BECCA

Jimmie rocks with the train Nina and Becca turn away
NINA (0S)
Classic MUNI shit
EXT HP SHIPYARDS and HP BAY - MORNING - TRAVELING
Jimmie walks down the street holding his broken board like a
wounded warrior returning from battle He passes the

neighborhood kids playing in a pile of leaves two women in
scrubs waiting for a bus the old man in his fez and kimono

Jimmie reaches the dock He looks out over the water

Montgomery sits on his rowboat watching life on land unfold
from his usual safe distance

He sees Jimmie The two hold eye contact
Montgomery collects his fishing gear and begins to paddle in
HP DOCK - From Montgomerys perspective we slop towards
Jimmie standing on the dock statuesque We bump up and down
against the choplessand lessuntil we sail smoothly
to him
Montgomery steps onto the dock and sees his broken board
Jimmie shakes his head avoiding eye contact
MONTGOMERY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I did that Jim It was a
stupid play
JIMMIE
No it wasn’t I’m sorry I didn’t
tell you the truth I just wanted
it to be true it felt so good you

know

MONTGOMERY
That’s okay-

Jimmie hugs him tight
Montgomery hugs him back

MONTGOMERY
Jimmie You hungry

JIMMIE
Yeah Starving

EXT MONTGOMERYS HOUSE - MORNING

Jimmie and Mont walk towards the house Mont’s finger through
the gill of a fish he’s caught None of the Greek Chorus are
around only burnt candles empty bottles and dead flowers
INT MONTGOMERYS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmie Montgomery and Grandpa watch an old movie Montgomery

rapt by the tension explains the plot to Grandpa who looks
glad to have his boys back He squeezes Montgomerys arm

971

INT MONTGOMERYS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jimmie watches Montgomery who stands in the bathtub in undies
and boots He whistles as he scrapes the scales off a petrale

JIMMIE
Why are you in your tightie
whities

MONTGOMERY

Im cleaning fish
Jimmie smiles and begins chuckling Its as if Montgomerys
quirks were put on earth for him alone to enjoy
INT MONTGOMERYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jimmie grabs his cot from under the bed and rolls it out
Mont whispers goodnight to a drawing of his mom on the wall

Jimmie stares at the ceiling then at Montgomery He watches
his friend sleep at peace Jimmies eyes float to the
painting above Montgomerys head

A boat struggles against the chop of the San Francisco Bay

INT MONTGOMERYS BEDROOM - MORNING

Montgomery wakes one side of his hair flattened from the
pillow He sits up to find Jimmies cot rolled up

INT MONTGOMERYS LIVING ROOM and KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Montgomery walks into the living room Grandpa lies asleep on
the recliner under a blanket Montgomery shuts off the TV

He enters the kitchen and finds a flier folded in half
Below the play’s header “THE LAST BLACK MAN IN SAN
FRANCISCO” is MONTGOMERY in beautiful handwriting

Montgomery takes a seat and opens the flyer It reads

IM SORRY I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE THANK YOU FOR
BEING MY BEST FRIEND

Montgomery stares down at the card and then out the window
With the twinkling harp-plucks of Sam Cookes “DEEP RIVER”

we push towards the window The song rises as we see that
Monts red rowboat is gone Montgomery looks out at the Bay

MONTAGE DEEP RIVER

EXT BUS STOP - Montgomery sits at a bus stop mumbling to
himself as he waits patiently

INT GROCERY STORE - Montgomery the last black man in San
Francisco stands behind the fish counter He stares eyes
slightly out of focus at the rows of dead fish on ice

INT BUS - Montgomery sits on the bus staring out

EXT THE BAY - We glide over deep water and slowly tilt up to
find Jimmie rowing against the chop like Montgomerys
painting Freedom fear and determination fill his face

EXT THE HOUSE - Montgomery stares up at the now lifeless
house from across the street Stripped of its molding and
intricate detail the renovated facade now boasts a two car
garage beneath it

INT THE HOUSE PARLOR and FRONT HALLWAY - Young couples pass
between rooms whispering in hushed tones Montgomery floats
past them like a ghost The house is staged for purchase an
Ikea couch reclaimed wood table cardboard books and wax fruit

Montgomery picks up a fake fruit and stares at it in his
hand He glances into the library with a purposeful look

INT THE HOUSE LIBRARY - A couple inspects the built-in
bookcases failing to notice one of the shelves behind them
slowly creak open and reveal a shadowy cavity

From the darkness out leaps a dust-covered Montgomery
fingers gnarled like a vengeful ghost Just before they can
scream-

EXT HP SHIPYARDS HP DOCK - DUSK

Montgomery dangles his feet over the edge of the dock The
faint sounds of sirens blare somewhere far away

Behind him a candlelit vigil makes its way past his house
with signs reading RIP KOFI They cast flickering gold shadows
onto Montgomerys reflection in the water He stares out at
the Bay as the incoming mist begins to fog his view
