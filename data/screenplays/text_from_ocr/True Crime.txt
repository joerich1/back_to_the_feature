A SERIES OF VERY TIGHT CLOSEUPS a convict FRANK
BEACHUM is being examined by a prison doctor DOCTOR

CLOSEUP of a clock on the wall 1017

The face of LUTHER PLUNKITT the San Quentin Prison
warden watching the examination and then looking at the
clock Plunkitt is white fortyish and a little soft in
the gut Hes seen enough in his years at San Quentin to
be neither a pushover nor a martinet To him the exam is
routine but hes also mindful of its significance Its
the final exam before Beachums execution in about twenty-
six hours He nods toward a guard who is sitting at a
typewriter The guard types

CLOSEUP of Beachums face We see that he is young and

of the recent college graduate

down here just the way ALAN MANN likes it Alan emerges
from the cafeteria carrying an extra large Styrofoam cup
of coffee He stops to schmooze with the guys who run
the presses -- newspaper guys ink-stained and tough
Alan is tall and broad-shouldered with a belly that
hangs over his belt he looks like an athlete gone to
seed Hes the newspapers editor-in-chief

BOB FINDLEY the city editor is younger and softer As
he approaches Alan he is wearing a neatly-pressed pink
shirt and a cheerful tie no jacket Bob composes his
face and takes a deep breath He prides himself on being
caring Just now he has the look of a man who is about
to impart some serious news

BOB

INT ELEVATOR - MORNING

They enter Alan punches four with his free hand and
impatiently stabs at the close door button

cubicles Alan crosses the city section where a handful
of reporters are making phone calls and pecking away at
computer keyboards Bob follows a few paces behind

declaration He opens his coffee and looks up
expectantly at Bob

INT BATHROOM - CLOSE ON TOILET - MORNING 18

where Everett stark naked is emptying an ashtray

Butts fall into the bowl and then we see hands using
toilet paper to wipe out the ashes We hear Everetts
voice as though hes talking to someone in another room

EVERETT (0S)
Hey I could have been happy in New York
forever -- They were about to let me run
the investigative team That would have
put me on the Pulitzer track

He finishes the job and emerges into the adjoining
bedroom

INT BEDROOM - MORNING 19

On the mussed bed looking wondrously shapely and
wondrously naked is PATRICIA FINDLEY Bobs wife She
watches Everetts approach admiringly but there is
something sardonic in her smile Everett puts the
ashtray on a bedside table

EVERETT
It was a nice life -- Broadway shows
downtown clubs Elaines every night
veal chops up the wazoo

He does a little dance singing James Browns Got the
Feeling playing imaginary maracas

EVERETT
Baby baby baa-by Baby baby baa-
by Baby baby baa-by ‘Course they

never served anything like this
He swoops down and bites Patricia on the buttock
PATRICIA
Ooh Now you have to kiss it and make

it better

PATRICIA

EVERETT

(imitating him)
Oh I got caught with the editors wife

Everett gets up and begins pulling on his pants
EVERETT

Patricia watches him dress affecting a pout

( ) 19

PATRICIA

PATRICIA

simple people swept away in a whirlwind
of passion Something like that

Everett finishes putting on his shirt and bends over to
give her a kiss Then he turns away looking for his
wallet and keys

PATRICIA

EVERETT
(smiling)
Thanks I dont love you too

expectantly

pen Beachum holds a cigarette between two of his
fingers sending a zig-zag of smoke to the ceiling The
ash has grown long It drops to the table of its own
weight Beachum doesnt move his hand at all

BEACHUM

PLUNKITT

cigarette has burned down to the filter and Plunkitt
stands there a moment looking nervously at it Finally
Beachum reaches to the tinfoil ashtray next to him and
crushes it out

follows him

disks and tapes

JANE

Bob Findley explosion

Everett grins shakes his head and reaches toward his
shirt pocket half-pulling out a pack of cigarettes
Jane looks at him in alarm

JANE

EVERETT

seizes upon is a tape cassette marked Beachum He
slams it into his recorder and stuffs the earphone in his
ear

ANGLE ON EVERETTS COMPUTER SCREEN

The Beachum file As Everett listens to Michelles tape
he flashes to various photos and newspaper clippings on

soda machine leaves the ENGINE RUNNING gets out drops
money in the slot buys a soda and climbs back in her

only down to his chest)

He scans the store -- racks of food food sale posters in
the window and above the front counter a TV BLARING
But no one apparently minding the store

CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE
The door slams behind him
BACK TO SCENE

At the sound of the SLAMMING DOOR Beachum pops up from
behind the counter His face and shirt are bloody his
eyes wild He and Porterhouse stare at each other and
then Beachum panics and runs for it scampering from
behind the counter and straight out a service door on the
counters left side As he goes we can see him from

PORTERHOUSES POV

Beachums whole body is IN VIEW and there is clearly a
gun in his hand

CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE

Shocked and frightened and not certain at first of what
he has seen

He moves toward the counter and as he does we begin to
discover what is behind it -- the corpse of Amy Wilson

blood is still oozing Porterhouses SCREAM FADES BACK

and his cigarette

Everett lets out a blast of smoke yanks open his desk
drawer and stubs out his cigarette in a butt-filled
secret ashtray there Meanwhile hes reading the
transcript Bridget peers over his shoulder

BRIDGET
Gosh Mr Reporter Is that what real
newspapermen get to read

EVERETT

(reading aloud)
Dale Porterhouse I couldnt have
heard any shots because I had all the
windows rolled up and I had the radio

overheated Close quote So that

The grocery is a one-story red brick bunker with a dingy
awning To one side of the door a Coke machine

FRONT WINDOW OF POCUMS

Just over a line of withering oranges and tomatoes a
hand-lettered sign has been taped An Eye for an Eye
Beachum has to Die

Underneath a dripping syringe with a deaths head on the
tube

Everett raises his eyebrows He gets out of the car

As he does he accidentally kicks something that has
rolled from under his seat -- an old (very old)
cantaloupe It sploshes to the ground and shudders there
for a moment Everett makes a sometimes-I-even-gross-—
myself-out face gingerly picks up the rotting
cantaloupe and throws it into the vacant lot next door
As it hits the ground and explodes Everett makes a bomb
exploding noise with his mouth

INT POCUMS GROCERY - DAY 43

The market is a long rectangle with a counter at one end
behind which sits a sullen bloated woman in a bulging
white T-shirt The grocery racks are perpendicular to
the counter and above the counter a television is
blaring Everett stands for a moment wiping his
cantaloupe-tainted hand against his pants On the TV
screen a reporter is doing a stand-up outside the San
Quentin prison walls talking about the somber mood
there the tight security and so forth

Everett strolls toward the counter looking around

notices a button on her T-shirt Remember Amy

COUNTER WOMAN
Am I gonna be in the newspaper

Everett doesnt answer Hes just spotted something on
the floor to the side of the counter and now he crouches
down for a better look

On the floor the kind of white outlines that might have
been left in the linoleum if a foot rack had once been
placed there
Everett gets up

EVERETT

Hey did there used to be something
here

COUNTER WOMAN
Oh yessir there was Thats where we
used to keep the potato chips But Mr

She indicates the other side of the counter where
customers might line up to pay

COUNTER WOMAN

Everett pauses a moment looking around

EVERETT
Nope Good point Its not part of the

suit

PORTERHOUSE
I do think theres such a thing in this
world as good citizenship
(MORE )
( )

PORTERHOUSE (CONTD)
And I do think that when a man sees an
injustice being done let alone a cold-
blooded murder --

EVERETT

Youre not saying you saw the murder
PORTERHOUSE

Of course not I never said that
EVERETT

So what exactly did you see
PORTERHOUSE

Look Ive been all through this a

million --
EVERETT

Sorry I cant seem to put it all
together in my head

PORTERHOUSE
Its simple I came in to use the phone
-- my car had overheated And soon as
the door shut behind me Beachum jumped
up from behind the counter

INSIDE EVERETTS MIND - CLOSE ON BEACHUM 65

We OVERCRANK and Beachum rises from behind the counter
looking bloody looking mean He stares at Porterhouse
then runs out the door

PORTERHOUSE (VO)
He was bloody all over and he had a gun
in his hand I guess he had been
bending over Amy uh Mrs Wilson and
that must have been when he took her
ring and necklace Anyway he got one
look at me and ran out of the service
entrance

CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE

Shocked and dismayed Now he runs over to the counter
We hear his BREATHING He looks behind the counter

PORTERHOUSES POV

Behind the counter Amy Wilson lies dead in a pool of
blood

PORTERHOUSE (VO)
My first concern was the girl so I
immediately called 9-1-1 -- I figured
rather than chase a killer with a gun
Id let the police handle it

66 INT BREAD COMPANY RESTAURANT —- DAY 66

EVERETT
And they did

PORTERHOUSE
And they sure did As I say we live by
the rule of law in this country and uh
-- arent you going to take notes or
record me or something Usually when
Ive talked to reporters --

EVERETT
Oh I have a photographic memory

PORTERHOUSE
What Are you kidding

Everett pulls a notebook and a Bic out of his pocket

EVERETT
Sorry Not myself today Ate a bad
oyster

PORTERHOUSE

Yes Well my point was simply this

During his next speeches Everett pretends to be writing
in his notebook Actually he is drawing something

EVERETT
Can I just do you mind if I just cut to
the chase Didnt you ever have any
doubts About your testimony

PORTERHOUSE
Never Why should I

EVERETT
You definitely saw Frank Beachums face
And the gun in his hand

PORTERHOUSE
Obviously if Id had any doubt I would
have told the police

( )

66

EVERETT
Ooh boy Musta been scary He was
pointing the gun right at you

Everett makes a gun shape with his fingers and points it
at Porterhouse Porterhouse is a bit taken aback

PORTERHOUSE
No Thank God no

EVERETT
Waving it high in the air

Everett holds his hands over his head bugs his eyes and
pretends to wave the gun

PORTERHOUSE
Of course not He had it down by his
side in a very normal way

CLOSE ON EVERETT

EVERETT
Well how could you see it over the
potato chips

A pause -- just a split-second

Everett is staring into Porterhouse in a way we havent
seen before his eyes are like lasers Hes not trying
to spook Porterhouse hes just looking into him deep
into him searching out the truth

PORTERHOUSE
I dont understand What potato chips
I had a very clear view

Everett thrusts his notebook in front of Porterhouse On
the paper he has sketched a rudimentary blueprint of the
store -- the counter the two doors and the potato-chip
rack that had left the white outlines on the floor

INT POCUMS GROCERY - DAY 67

The sketch segues into an OVERHEAD SHOT of the store and
the CAMERA GLIDES DOWN TO the show what Everett is
narrating

EVERETT (VO)
I mean you came in right You saw
Beachum stand up behind the counter and
you saw him run But between you and
the service entrance well see thats
where the potato-chip rack was

(MORE )

( )

67

EVERETT (VO) (CONTD)
And it just kind of seems to me you
couldnt have seen the gun over that
rack if Beachum wasnt waving it in the
air or something

Over this speech we see Beachum running out the service
door again but this time the potato-chip rack stands
between him and Porterhouse Porterhouse can see Beachum
only from the chest up Plainly no gun is visible

CLOSE ON EVERETT (PRESENT) 68

Still staring into Porterhouse The CAMERA PULLS BACK to
show

INT BREAD COMPANY RESTAURANT —- DAY

PORTERHOUSE
Why would I say I saw the gun if I
didnt

EVERETT

You tell me Maybe you felt good
talking to the police the reporters --
maybe you wanted to give them a little
more than you really had Maybe you
wanted to be the man tell the girls
around the coffee machine --

PORTERHOUSE
(angry now)
This is absurd You think I would
jeopardize a mans life to impress the
people in my office

Everett looks at him and knows that he has no real
evidence Nothing but those white outlines on the floor
of Pocums -- that and what he saw for a nanosecond in
Porterhouses eyes

EVERETT
I dont know Mr Porterhouse We only
just met

PORTERHOUSE

Listen wise guy I did a little
research on you before I returned your
call Youre the guy who did the big
crusade to get that rapist released last
year that lying whats-his-name --

( )

EVERETT
(ruefully)
You wouldnt be referring to Mike
Vargas
PORTERHOUSE

Yeah you had the facts then didnt
you Except when you threatened him
with a DNA test he confessed Im
surprised you didnt get fired on the
spot Mr Everett

EVERETT
Yeah Me too

Everett takes a deep breath and rubs his eyes He
visibly sags Is this another Mike Vargas case Does he
have anything anything at all to go on

EVERETT
Look Im sorry I was out of line I
thought there was -- I dont know what I
thought

PORTERHOUSE

Youre damn right you dont And if you
go to press with some pack of lies and
innuendos believe me-- my lawyers will
sue you and your paper so fast you wont
know what hit you

did it take you half an hour

EVERETT
Come on You know the appeals system

twelve-year-old Legal Aid guy and if he
didnt object to something at the trial
then the appeals guys had nothing to
work with no matter how sharp they
were which of course they werent

ALAN

EVERETT
Alan for Christs sake theyre gonna
kill this guy

Everett crushes out his cigarette and stares at Alan
Alan stares back Finally he sighs and grins ruefully

ALAN
All right all right Youre saying you

into some kind of big fight-for-justice
story And thatll give me an excuse to
stand up for you when Bob asks me to

Beachum and Gail huddled closely on the cot

BEACHUM

GAIL

at the motel again

BEACHUM

Gail suddenly buries her face in his shoulder He holds
her breathing her in Bonnie turns toward the wall
sobbing

BEACHUM

BEACHUM

(beat)

He reaches for it but Gails face shows she doesnt
understand

BEACHUM
Your mama will have it for when you need
it later on So you go on now I love

Beachum gently delivers Gail to the female guard Hes
trying desperately not to choke up as Gail follows the
guard meekly for a few steps before turning back --

GAIL
Why cant you just come home You
should just kill all these people and
come home

The guard starts to pull her away Beachum puts an arm
over his face -- this is more than he can bear Bonnie
holds her face in her hands sobbing The door closes
but we can still hear her shrill little voice

Goodbye Daddy Goodbye Daddy

INTEXT EVERETTS CAR - DAY 78

The car is rocketing along at a rate far beyond its
apparent aerodynamic capabilities Blue smoke plumes
from the tailpipe

Inside Everett is revved up On the RADIO ELVIS sings
Jailhouse Rock Everett bangs the dashboard and sings
along

EXT PRISON - EVERETTS POV - DAY 79
It looms over the horizon a sobering hulk of gray stone
EXT OUTSIDE THE PRISON GATES - DAY 80
Everetts car passes a growing crowd of protestors and
death-penalty advocates camped out at the gate Its a
macabre tailgate party Everett glances at the Remember
Amy posters
FEATURING POSTERS

The same photo of Amy Wilson that we have seen on TV --
the drab blouse the gold locket the mousy brown hair

EXT PRISON PARKING AREA - DAY 81

The CAR pulls in COUGHING blue smoke It shudders for a
moment after Everett TURNS OFF the ENGINE He gets out

A very old steak still in its supermarket packaging
thuds to the ground as he steps out He looks at it
curiously for a moment -- When did he intend to cook it
How drunk was he -- and then he picks it up It seems
to be oozing Gingerly Everett tosses it in the back
seat He heads for the prison

INT STARK PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY 82

Thick concrete walls Sound of BARS CLANKING shut
Everett follows Atkins

INT DEATHWATCH CELL - ANGLE ON REEDY —- DAY

He types in the chronological 1604 -- reporter
arrives for interview

Then he looks up at Everett who is looking down at him

REEDY
Youve got fifteen minutes Mr Everett
By order of Warden Plunkitt Keep it
to fifteen minutes

EVERETTS POV

Beachum moves toward the bars His face is marked by a
profound weariness He looks drained hollowed out
almost spectral Now Bonnie rises up behind him and
moves toward the bars too her hand clutching Beachums
the knuckles white

BACK TO SCENE
Reedy pulls up a chair in front of the cell for Everett

Beachum sticks his hand through the cell and Everett
shakes it

BEACHUM
Mr Everett Im Frank Beachum Have
a

He gestures toward the chair

EVERETT
Yeah Thanks

Everett sits and pulls out his notebook and pen Beachum
gently disengages himself from Bonnie and lowers himself
into the chair at the table in front of Everett Bonnie
sinks back down onto the cot her eyes on Everett
Everett fiddles for a cigarette jerks one halfway out of
the pack and offers it to Beachum

BEACHUM

I got ‘em

They light up and then they smoke for a long awkward
moment

BEACHUM
Hows that girl That other that
Michelle She had some accident
EVERETT
Yeah Car crash Shes she didnt

make it

( )

84 84
BEACHUM
Oh man Im sorry to hear that
EVERETT
Yeah She was yeah Thanks

Another awkward silence They smoke

BEACHUM
Well I guess you want to talk to me
about how it feels In here

EVERETT
Yeah thats it Its a human interest
story

Everett watches the long sad tired face pushing the
words out at him through the bars through the smoke

BEACHUM
(his voice flat)
I been thinking about that Hey look
what my daughter drew me My daughter
Gail Calls it Green Pastures’

Beachum shows him the drawing Everett tries to look
interested

BEACHUM
Well only thing I want to say I wanted
to tell everyone that I believe in Jesus
Christ Our Lord and Savior

Everett scribbles dutifully on his pad Blieve in JC
Lord Sav

BEACHUM
And I believe Im going to a better
place and theres a better justice
there you know and I wont say Im
not afraid cause I think

A loud sob from Bonnie who is sitting on the cot

BEACHUM

cause I think everyones afraid of
dying pretty much I came to my faith
late in life you know I done some bad
things when I was younger but that was
then you know Anyway I know the
crooked will be made straight -- thats
what the Bible says and I believe that

Everett scribbles crooked made straight

( ) 84

BEACHUM
So thats how I feel about it

He looks at Everett but for some reason Everett cant
manage to look back Everett just keeps staring down at
his pad

BEACHUM
Is that all right Mr Everett

Everett cant look at him He glances over at Reedy

REEDY
You got nine more minutes

BEACHUM
Is that what you wanted or

Everett finally looks up blowing a stream of smoke in an
unsteady breath He leans forward forcing himself to
look at this condemned roiling man living out his last
hours -- the pain in that face and the toil Bonnie
looks up watching Everett

EVERETT
Mr Beachum You dont know me Mr
Beachum but Ill tell you I probably
got a screw loose somewhere To tell
you the truth I dont give a rats ass
about Jesus Christ And I dont care
about justice in this life or the next
To be honest I dont even care about
whats right and wrong Never have

Everett drops his cigarette to the floor and rubs it out
with his shoe Beachum and Bonnie are watching him
mesmerized

Everett taps his nose

EVERETT
You know what this is

BEACHUM
Is this some kind of joke

EVERETT
Its no joke Mr Beachum Its my
nose And my nose -- well to tell you

the pitiful truth its my whole goddamn

life When my nose says something

stinks I gotta have faith in it just

like you have your faith in Jesus
(MORE )

( )

84

EVERETT (CONTD)
When its working I know theres truth
out there somewhere But if it leads me
astray well I may as well drive off a
cliff I really -- Im nothing The
point is lately Im not a hundred
percent positive my nose is working
right So I have to know Did you kill
that woman or not

BEACHUM
(dully
disbelieving)
What

EVERETT
What happened dammit In that store
The day Amy Wilson was shot

The two men stare at each other We see that Everett is
looking right into Beachum the way he looked right into
Porterhouse

BEACHUM
I went in to buy a bottle of A-1
Sauce

EVERETT

And you paid Amy for it at the counter
BEACHUM
Well no I never got it Look I told
them all this --
CLOSE ON EVERETT
EVERETT

INT POCUMS GROCERY - DAY 85

Beachum enters through the main door To his left
behind the counter is Amy

BEACHUM
Hey Amy Where you keep the steak
sauce

AMY

ketchup and relish is

BEACHUM

( )

85 85

He starts to go but when Amy calls to him he approaches
the counter

AMY

BEACHUM

AMY

Beachum nods and heads toward the back of the store The
bathroom is in a small entryway and as Beachum heads
toward it we hear the front DOOR SLAM Beachum
struggles for a moment with the sticky bathroom door and
goes in

86 INT DEATHWATCH CELL - DAY 86

EVERETT
So you werent even mad about the money

BEACHUM
Well I wanted her to understand I
didnt like doing business that way
But she was cool I liked her

EVERETT
Were you carrying a gun
BEACHUM
No way man
EVERETT

So then what
INT POCUMS GROCERY - BATHROOM - DAY

Beachum is standing in the stall (its a one-toilet
bathroom) humming to himself We hear MUFFLED VOICES
outside and at first Beachum doesnt notice them He
finishes and FLUSHES the TOILET Over the sound of the
flush the VOICES GROW LOUDER Beachum cant be sure
what hes hearing Then he hears Amys anguished
voice--

AMY (0OS)
Please Not that

-- followed by a GUNSHOT For a moment Beachum stands
paralyzed Then he bolts out of the stall pushes at the
sticky bathroom door kicks it open runs down the small
entryway and emerges into the main body of the store

INT POCUMS GROCERY - BEACHUMS POV - DAY

The door to the service entrance is slamming Theres no
one else in sight Beachum runs toward the counter
behind it Amy Wilson is lying on her back her eyes
wide her chest torn open by a bullet the last breaths
rattling out of her

Outside very distantly the sound of a CAR DOOR being
SLAMMED and then the SCREECH of TIRES

ANOTHER ANGLE

Beachum falls to his knees by Amys side trying
everything he can think of making up his own brand of
CPR as he goes along -- thumping her chest breathing
into her mouth trying to staunch the blood with his
hands calling her name Blood soaks his shirt
splatters onto his face runs down his fingers Amy
looks into his eyes terrified and then her eyes go
blank

Dimly he hears the FRONT DOOR CLOSE And a voice

PORTERHOUSE (0S)
Hey Anybody here

( )

88

Beachum pops up from behind the counter Porterhouses
jaw drops

PORTERHOUSE
Hey Whats going on Oh my God

For a moment he and Beachum stare at each other and
then for another split second Beachum looks down at
himself realizes how all this must seem and bolts for
the service door We see clearly that the potato chip
rack stands between him and Porterhouse

EXT POCUMS GROCERY - BEACHUMS POV - DAY 89

He is RUNNING OUT the service door INTO a small
passageway full of garbage cans fire extinguishers
boxes and crates OUT the outer screen door RUNNING --
and wham Nancy Larsons car nearly backs into him

ANOTHER ANGLE

Beachum looks up and we see Larsons eyes looking back
startled from her rear-view mirror Then Beachum runs
out of the parking lot

INT DEATHWATCH CELL - DAY 90

EVERETT
‘Please not that

BEACHUM
swhat I heard

Everett pops a cigarette into his mouth never taking his
gaze off Beachums face

EVERETT
Whyd you run

BEACHUM
I shouldnt have But you know Ima
two-time loser Mr Everett And there
I was with all that blood and a dead
girl right next to me and a white man
staring at me like I was -- I just
panicked

EVERETT
So who shot her Frank

Bonnie gasps She is staring at Everett

( )

90 90

BEACHUM

EVERETT
Did Porterhouse see the gun

REEDY
(threateningly)
You got five minutes over there

BEACHUM
I told you Wasnt no gun

EVERETT
Did he see the shooter

BEACHUM
I dont know How should I know

EVERETT
Of course he didnt Cause by the time
he pulled into the parking lot the
shooter was gone Thats why he didnt
hear the shots either

REEDY
Mr Everett

BEACHUM
I dont know I dont know when
anything happened

EVERETT
Cause you dont know how long you were
down on the floor trying to save Amys
life

Bonnie sobs but Everett ignores her Beachum begins to
slump and look away but Everett only grows more intent
In the bg Reedy picks up the phone and talks anxiously
into it He never takes his eyes off Everett

EVERETT
So what was it Frank a simple robbery
Who else could have been there Come
on Frank Someone have something
against her

BEACHUM
I just dont know I didnt see

EVERETT
(bearing down
on him)
Come on give me something
( )

90

BEACHUM
(worked up)
I dont know what you want

Reedy squeaks his chair and stands up

REEDY
All right thats it

Bonnie flings herself off the bed and rushes toward the
bars

BONNIE
No

Everett looks at her desperate tear-stained face but
already Reedy is grabbing him moving him forcefully
away

BONNIE
You believe us Dont you Do you

EVERETT
(to Reedy)
All right all right

REEDY
Lets go Upsetting people

BONNIE

Wheres your goddamn heart man Dont

All right Sorry Yeah

They are at the door but now Everett looks back Bonnie
is staring at him the way youd look at a child who had
just done something thoughtless and cruel

BONNIE
Where were you Dear God where were
you all this time

Reedy starts to move Everett out but Everett resists

EVERETT
It wasnt my story There was an
accident -- It wasnt supposed to be my

story
Reedy pushes Everett out into the hall
91 INT PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

As Reedy pushes Everett into the corridor Plunkitt is
waiting for him He looks quizzically at Everett and
holds out his hand

PLUNKITT
(shaking hands)
Everett

EVERETT
Warden Good to see you again

PLUNKITT

(gently)
Ill walk you to your car

They walk

PLUNKITT
Terrible about Ms Ziegler

EVERETT
Yeah Horrible thing

PLUNKITT
You know she gave me to understand that
she wanted to talk to Beachum about you
know his emotions before the execution
(MORE )
( )

91 91

PLUNKITT (CONTD)
Human interest stuff ‘Cause otherwise
we do most press interviews by phone at
this point Less risk of upsetting the
prisoner

EVERETT
Yeah I probably should have prepared
better Kind of a last-minute thing
92 EXT PRISON PARKING LOT - DAY 92

Plunkitt accompanies Everett toward his (Everetts) car

PLUNKITT
You know people come in here the
press Prisoners tell ‘em things-- all

kind of heart-wrenching things And
then the next day in the paper were
the ones who come off sounding like hard
guys It can get pretty frustrating is
all

EVERETT
Sure Of course

PLUNKITT
We have to do what the state tells us to
do Makes it a little tough on us here
if we show up in the newspaper as bloody
murderers or anything like that

EVERETT
Right I understand completely

PLUNKITT

Knew you would

(beat)
You know these things go through all
kind of trials and appeals before they
get to us Its no use trying to figure
out whos naughty and whos nice and
then come sliding down the chimney like

a hero -- not on execution day Youre
not Santa Claus No such thing as Santa
Claus

They reach the car Plunkitt seems as though he wants to
say something else but instead he just stands there

PLUNKITT
Well

( )

92

Everett looks at him expectantly but Plunkitt cant find
the words Suddenly Everetts expression changes

EVERETT
Youre not sure are you Luther

Plunkitt looks at Everett for a long moment then slaps
his shoulder

PLUNKITT
You drive safe now

Plunkitt turns and walks back toward the prison doors
EXT DOWNTOWN COURTHOUSE - DAY 93

CECILIA NUSSBAUM circuit attorney comes out the formal
door and starts down a series of long stone steps Shes
a small ugly woman with a big fleshy beezer sticking
out of a face that resembles a collection of frowns all
glued on top of one another Shes accompanied by WALLY
CARTWRIGHT an imposing black attorney in a concrete-gray
suit Everett bounds up to them

EVERETT
Cecilia

Nussbaum and Cartwright look but never break stride

EVERETT
Wait This is urgent

NUSSBAUM
Not a good time Everett

EVERETT
I know youre busy but --

Cartwright crosses laterally like a good linebacker
Everett is shoved off-course He staggers a step to the
side

NUSSBAUM
Not now Call my office

EVERETT
Cecilia Im telling you --

He reaches out to slow her Cartwright pokes him in the
chest

CARTWRIGHT
Look

Everett knocks the finger away
( )

93 93

EVERETT
Oh bullshit Youre a fucking circuit
attorney Im a reporter You wanna hit
me or you wanna keep your job

NUSSBAUM
Why dont you get in the car Wally
EVERETT

Wally
Cartwright wavers a moment and then moves toward the
car
CARTWRIGHT
(murmuring)

New York asshole

NUSSBAUM
What is it Everett

EVERETT
(still fuming)
All right Frank Beachum Who else was
there

NUSSBAUM
Are you back on the bottle

EVERETT
When Amy Wilson was killed who else was
there Porterhouse Nancy Larson
Beachum And who else

Once again Everetts eyes have become a laser beam He
is watching Cecilias eyes the way he watched
Porterhouses eyes and Frank Beachums eyes Cecilias
eyes are very still

NUSSBAUM
What difference does it make

Everetts face He knows hes right

EVERETT
Hes the shooter Cecilia Whoever he
was he shot Amy Who was he Come on

NUSSBAUM
Everett I dont know what kind of
cockamamie conspiracy theory youre
working on but this is a solid case I
dont send innocent men to the Death
House
( ) 93

EVERETT
I know that I do But this time you
made a mistake

Sitting in the Cadillac Cartwright HONKS the HORN
Without even looking up Nussbaum holds up her index

finger

EVERETT
Beachum was in the bathroom when Amy got
shot He only went to Pocums to buy a
bottle of steak sauce

NUSSBAUM
Youve always been a gullible
sonuvabitch Everett Read the
transcripts A witness saw Beachum with
the gun

EVERETT
He didnt see the gun There were
potato chips in the way

NUSSBAUM
Youre telling me he said that
EVERETT
No But I could see it in his face I

could tell

Nussbaums face changes to a mask of leathery disdain

NUSSBAUM
You havent got jackshit

EVERETT
He didnt do it How much jackshit do I
need

Nussbaum studies him for a second and then begins heading
down the stairs toward her car Everett follows

EVERETT
There was someone else wasnt there

NUSSBAUM
(without looking
back)
A kid Bought a Coke from the machine
He didnt even look inside

EVERETT
He shot Amy Wilson

( )

93 93

NUSSBAUM
We interviewed him We issued a
description of his car and he came in of
his own free will His story checked
out He didnt see a thing

EVERETT
He shot her You didnt get him to say
anything because you had already
arrested Beachum -- you thought you had
the guy But the kid was the guy

Nussbaum reaches the car Everett thrusts himself
between her and the door

EVERETT
Tell me his name

NUSSBAUM
He was nothing to the case We put him
in the same lineup Beachum was in Both
our witnesses looked right at him and
still fingered Beachum as the killer

She looks at Everett triumphantly -- and indeed for a
moment Everett is shaken But he quickly recovers

EVERETT
Okay but what do you expect Your
witnesses didnt even get there till the
shooter was long gone Look just give
me the kids name Let me talk to him

NUSSBAUM
Howm I supposed to remember his name
after six years He was nothing to the
case

EVERETT
Its in your files your notes
Somewhere

NUSSBAUM
(opening the car door)
Call me tomorrow I1l see if I can
find it

She begins to get into the car but Everett grabs the
door drawing it back -- and her with it Everett is
burning with rage

( ) 93

EVERETT
If you let it wait till tomorrow then
you better sleep goddamn well tonight
Cause after today Im gonna haunt you
lady Im gonna hound the living shit
out of you

Nussbaum lets the door go and turns to face Everett She
is not large but she looks utterly terrifying

NUSSBAUM
(too quietly)
Im not Wally Steve Ima lot bigger
than Wally And if you threaten me
again therell be little pieces of your
life all over the gutter ‘Cause Ill
blow the rest away

Everett stares at her She shuts the door with a heavy
thud Wally is about to drive away when Nussbaum opens
the car window

NUSSBAUM
One more thing barfly Just thought
you oughta know before your latest lost
cause confesses Anyone ever tell you
that Beachum volunteered for a lie
detector test Yeah He flunked big
time Sure its inadmissible -- thats
why you didnt read about it in the
transcripts Still it kind of captured
our interest Why dont you go pour
yourself a tall one and think it over

Everett stares at her The car speeds off

For a moment Everett crumbles He sits down on the
steps of the courthouse and puts his head in his hands

INT CITY ROOM - DAY 94

As Everett walks in he sees Bob Findley smiling at
him-- a tight terrible little smile that says I have
you by the balls Everett goes to his desk turns on his
computer and unwraps a ham sandwich He lets out a long
sigh

At the desk next to him TOM DONALDSON a plump reporter
in his forties rolls his chair over He holds a glass
of Scotch

DONALDSON
Hey Ev

( )

94

Everett nods For a moment he looks longingly at the

Scotch

Donaldson notices

DONALDSON
Hey you want a nip

Everetts eyes say yes but then he shakes his head

EVERETT
No Thanks Tom I dont think I
better

DONALDSON

Sorry Ev I forgot Hey whats with

evil eye all day

EVERETT
Yeah and you know what Its working

DONALDSON

DONALDSON

DONALDSON

EVERETT
Cool Could you see if you can track
down any of the detectives who worked
the Beachum case See if anyone ever

scene -- a kid I just need a name and
address

( ) 94
EVERETTS POV
At the other end of the room Alan is opening his office

door to look out And Bob is standing up from the city
desk ready to join the attack

DONALDSON
You got it
BACK TO SCENE
EVERETT
And Tom Could you get me a cup of

coffee

Donaldson blows him a kiss and walks away Everett picks
up the phone and punches in some numbers He gives Alan
a friendly wave Alan glances at Bob who returns the
glance Alan goes back in his office Bob sits back
down at his desk

VOICE (VO)
(on phone)

EVERETT
How do you know Arent you gonna

VOICE
(laughing)

Everybody here has memorized these files

witnesses Porterhouse Larson --

on top of that

( ) 94

EVERETT
(sighing)
Right Okay Thanks anyway

Everett hangs up the phone and looks at Donaldson
Donaldson shakes his head

EVERETT
Shit

Alans door opens again Alan steps out

EVERETT
Shit

DONALDSON
(hanging up)
That was Benning the whip on the
investigation Says it rings a bell

DONALDSON
And Ardsley who headed the
investigation hes retired Florida
somewhere

Everett sees Bob rise and head toward Alans office
Everett walks across the big room Its a long walk
INT ALANS OFFICE - DAY 95

Alan waves Everett inside and Bob comes in behind him
smiling his tight satisfied little smile

EVERETT
(to Bob)
Well you dont have to look so happy

about it

( )

95

BOB
Im not happy Why would you say that

Alan sits down and rubs his forehead

ALAN
I understand your interview at the
prison went somewhat beyond the
requirements of a human interest
sidebar

Everett grabs his cigarettes and shoots one into his
mouth

EVERETT
Okay I colored outside the lines a
little I dont think Plunkitts sore

Everett lights the cigarette and draws hard on it

BOB
No Steve He just figured you were
back on the booze And by the way
theres no smoking in this building

ALAN
Boys boys Come on I cant have
this Everett say youre sorry Bob
punch his lights out

BOB
(looking surprised)
This isnt a personal matter Alan
This was an important story I gave
Steve very specific instructions on
this The paper made promises to

Plunkitt
EVERETT
The guys innocent
BOB
(rolling his eyes)
Oh
EVERETT
(angrily)

He is Bob its not a human interest
sidebar Its a cruci-fucking-fiction
man What did you want me to say to
him hows the weather up there Mr
Christ

Everett pulls out his notebook and slaps it on the desk

( )

95 95

EVERETT
Look I got all that personal crap you
wanted He believes in God Hes going
straight to heaven Hes happy as a pig
in shit all right He cant wait to be
juiced You can use that in the
sidebar

BOB
(more in sorrow than
anger )
Thats not the point

EVERETT
You bet its not the point

ALAN
Well look Well take Everett off the
execution and put Harvey on it instead

BOB
Fine But thats still not the point
ALAN
Yeah well we all know what the point
is
BOB

(very deliberately)
The only point is that I cant work with
you anymore Steve Maybe youre a good
reporter Everyone says so But there
are other good reporters and they dont
have your attitude and they follow
instructions I cant work with you

Alan lets out a low moan Everett smokes studying the
floor Bob gazes at him righteously Then Everett
explodes

EVERETT

Why dont you just hit me Bob I
deserve it Ill fall down I1l
bleed Youll love it Itll be great
Punch me out man

(beat)
Then you can go home and hit your wife
too She likes it

Bobs head goes back a little but he retains his icy
calm

( )

95 95

BOB
I guess we cant all live in the world
of your imagination Steve Im not
going to hit anybody no matter what
they want If Patricia needs some other
kind of relationship shell have to go
find that But my marriage is none of
your business What matters is that
youre a thoughtless mentally
unbalanced man and I cant work with
you anymore

Alan moans again covering his eyes with his hand
Suddenly Everett realizes that hes losing his job He
turns to Alan

EVERETT
Alan listen Ive got the shooter

ALAN
(lowering his hand)

BOB
I dont think we should confuse two
separate issues

EVERETT

Kennedy --
ALAN
Shut up Bob How have you got him
EVERETT

ALAN
All right Who is he

Alan pinches the bridge of his nose and closes his eyes

ALAN
Youre telling me the shooter was a guy

lock of the outside door with a credit card He has just
dropped his flashlight he picks it up again and it
shines for a moment on Michelle Zieglers name on the
buzzer Everett monkeys with the credit card until he
hears a CLICK

Only it isnt really a click Its the SNAP of his
CREDIT CARD breaking in half He withdraws it and
watches the other piece fall to the ground His
flashlight jiggles on it for a moment

EVERETT
Shit

He looks guiltily over his shoulder The streets are
deserted Stealthily he reaches down and picks up an
object out of the darkness A tire iron

He rises The wooden door has a windowed top Everett
taps against it gently stealthily

The whole PANE SHATTERS with a resounding CRASH Everett
looks around again reaches in and turns the inside

tire iron into the jamb

The door swings slowly open Surprised Everett stumbles
in

Everett pulls away staggers hits a desk and fumbles
for the lamp switch He turns it on In the light he
sees an ELDERLY MAN sitting on the edge of Michelles
huge circular bed He is slumped and droopy but he is
watching Everett like a hawk

frightened patient on a gurney looking to a nurse for
reassurance To his chagrin Plunkitt finds his right
hand trembling against his pants leg He slips the hand
into his pocket and moves to a more private corner of the
room He takes a deep breath

Aid from Beachums arm and brings the IV tube with it

He throws it to the ground Blood spurts from Beachums
arm Solution spurts from the writhing IV tube on the
ground

sees Everett

GAIL
Come on Daddy Come on now

Beachum stays another moment giving Everett a long look
And Everett looks back intently a bit the way he looked
into the eyes of Porterhouse and Beachum too that day
in the prison Then slowly Beachum raises his hand
lays his finger against his eyebrow then lowers the
finger and points it at Everett in a kind of salute

Everett raises his cigarette and tilts it back at him
and Beach laughs Then Gail pulls him away and Beachum
wraps his arm around Bonnies shoulder The three of
them go off Everett smiles a deep satisfied smile

He tosses his cigarette into the gutter and walks away

FADE OUT
