A TITLE over darkness
Bel Air CA 1926
EXT RURAL ROAD - DAY

An empty country road Just sunbaked dirt and a couple freshly
planted palm trees Nothing else in sight

A truck pulls over The DRIVER gets out walks up to a YOUNG MAN
in a tux -- 20’s Mexican accented name’s MANUEL (MANNY) TORRES

TRUCK DRIVER
Ok Manuel right That’s for you
Twenty-five for the vehicle thirty
for transport of the livestock Just
put down “one horse” And your
signature there

MANNY
Did you say “one horse”

TRUCK DRIVER
Yeah It’s only one right

MANNY
Uh no It’s an elephant

TRUCK DRIVER
You mean -- like a really big horse
Do you speak English

MANNY
No I mean an elephant

TRUCK DRIVER
The call said “one horse” not a --
woah what the fuck is that

WE PAN 180 degrees -- to a giant ELEPHANT at the corner of the
road a WRANGLER (SAMI also Mexican) tending to it

TRUCK DRIVER (CONT’D)
Holy shit that’s a fucking elephant

MANNY TRUCK DRIVER (CONTD)
Look -- maybe there was a bad It’s beyond a “bad comm-
communication -- unication” this is a vehicle

for horses do I look like a
fucking Maharajah to you

MANNY
Couldn’t you just pop the roof off
He’s small for his age
TRUCK DRIVER
He’s a fucking elephant You know
what’s small A horse

The elephant starts shitting It’s overwhelming Huge alien and
gross Steam rises

TRUCK DRIVER (CONT’D)
Oh my God

MANNY
He won’t do that in your truck

TRUCK DRIVER
You’re goddamned right he won’t

MANNY
Sir -- if he’s not at Don Wallach’s
by nine the party won’t have an
elephant and I won’t have a job

TRUCK DRIVER
What the fuck does Wallach need an
elephant at his party for

MANNY
He doesn’t That’s the point

TRUCK DRIVER
--What

MANNY
He doesn’t need it No one needs an
elephant It’s the fact of having it
That’s the point
(realizing he’s not getting through)
Do you know how intelligent elephants
are Sir They mourn their dead

The elephant bellows as it continues shitting
TRUCK DRIVER
I don’t care if it recites the
Gettysburg fucking Address that thing
is not going in my goddamn truck

But before he can walk off -- Manny desperate whips out a wad of
cash Flashes it in the Drivers face

MANNY
And youre invited to the party

The Driver takes a moment Can’t believe he’s considering
EXT RURAL ROAD - AN HOUR LATER

The truck inches its way up the road led by a smaller car The
elephant’s back sticks out where the truck’s roof used to be

A rope connects the lead car to the truck’s fender The Driver is
back at the truck’s wheel pissed off -- more so every time the
elephant’s trunk swipes him

The procession reaches a hill Starts to climb up Immediately the
weight of the elephant is too great -- the truck starts SLIDING
BACKWARD Oh fuck Manny at the wheel of the lead car SLAMS on
the gas The rope goes taut Crying out to the Driver --

MANNY (CONTD) TRUCK DRIVER
More gas I’m TRYING

The SLIDE grows worse Now the elephant is SCREAMING Really
losing its shit Manny and the Wrangler leap out of the car rush
the truck start PUSHING with all their might to halt its slide
The elephant’s trunk WHACKS the Truck Driver in the head --

TRUCK DRIVER (CONTD) MANNY
Motherfucker iEMPUJAR Sami

The Wrangler starts throwing hay at the elephant Seeing this --

MANNY (IN SPANISH) (CONTD)
What the fuck are you doing
The elephant starts shitting The men straining against the
truck’s load push and push ALL SWEAT AND SCREAMS until --

EXT RURAL ROAD - ANOTHER HOUR LATER
Quiet The exhausted duo of vehicles crests the hill Then --

MANNY (CONTD)
Chinga

A COP has exited his car up ahead Manny brakes tries to quickly
slick his hair back rushes over --

MANNY (CONTD)
(muffling his accent)
Good afternoon

COP
(looks at Manny suspiciously)
Uhwhat exactly is going on here

MANNY
Well I work for Don Wallach and
were transporting the entertainment
for a party at his house
COP
Uh-huh That’s an elephant

MANNY
Yes sir that is correct

COP
Uh-huh You got a permit

MANNY
I didn’t know we needed one

COP
Can’t drive an elephant without a permit

MANNY
It’s a gift from the Griffith Park Zoo
Could we make an exception

A beat The Cop considers He’s calm jaded
COP
You work for Wallach
(Manny nods “Yes”)
How’s the guest-list for tonight

MANNY
Uh it’s impressive

COP
What kind of stars we talking about

MANNY
I’m not sure Someone said Garbo

COP
Oh yeah

MANNY
That’s what I heard I don’t know

The Cop thinks

COP
My cousin Benny jerks off to Garbo

MANNY COP (CONTD)
Yeah she’s beautiful -- I prefer opera singers
The Cop looks again at the elephant Ponders the combo

COP (CONT’D)
So we’re talking an elephant plus
Garbo plus others at Don Wallach’s
house tonight That right

MANNY
That’s right

The Cop nods A beat
COP
Benny lives with his wife and kids in
Reseda Ill see if they’re free
EXT DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - NIGHT 4

BANDLEADER (VO)

INT BEDROOM - DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - NIGHT 5

MUSIC blasts from a Victrola We’re now in an opulent bedroom
where a YOUNG WOMAN in high heels and purple satin cocktail dress
dances for a moment then SQUATS -- and starts PEEING onto the
bare chest of a hugely obese MAN lying on the carpet He GIGGLES

YOUNG WOMAN OBESE MAN
Does Piggy like that Ha ha ha it tickles

He SQUEALS as URINE flows through the rolls of fat on his belly
The Young Woman -- we’ll know her as JANE -- leans forward to
SNORT COKE from the nearest tabletop -- causing her PEE to hit the
Obese Man’s FACE He SHRIEKS with laughter helium-high voice
Well know him as ORVILLE PICKWICK

ORVILLE PICKWICK
Playtime with potty-time

Jane finishes peeing Orville wipes his face grabs a bathrobe --

ORVILLE PICKWICK
Piggy’s gonna get more King Bubbly

-- and an empty bottle in hand heads out We FOLLOW him --
INT HALLWAY - DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 6
-- as he COLLIDES into a tall Chinese-American WOMAN

ORVILLE PICKWICK
Mmm mmm

The Woman SLAPS Orville so fast he doesn’t know what hit him As
he holds his hand to his reddened cheek we FOLLOW her continuing
her walk as though nothing had happened She’s in her early 40s
She’s wearing a dress of embroidered silk her hair studded with
plum blossoms Her name is LADY FAY ZHU You do not fuck with her

As Lady Fay slips behind one door -- we see MANNY exit another

ORVILLE PICKWICK
José José
(Manny realizes he means him)
Get us some more

Orville hands Manny the bottle -- scurries back into his ROOM --
swings that door shut just as out of a third door -- BOB LEVINE
50’s Don Wallach’s fixer emerges

MANNY LEVINE
He wants more -- No Avoid him If he spots
you again tell him we ran
out

MANNY
--It’s only ten o’clock

LEVINE

That fucktard doesn’t know what day
it is

(points to a lower level)
Got another animal task for you One
of the guests brought a chicken as
their plus-one and now it’s causing
a scene Can you handle

MANNY
Sure

LEVINE
Careful I think someone fed it
mescaline

Manny processes Jesus We follow him to a GIANT CURVED STAIRCASE
As he descends we get our first wide view of --

INT BALLROOM - DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bedlam Underneath cathedral ceilings we see --

YELLOW BALLOONS -- towers of CHAMPAGNE -- overturned CHAIRS --
tux-clad MEN with their pants off -- topless WOMEN on tables The
whole place looks like a Gothic castle-meets-Gilded Age palace
descended into chaos and filled with 200 DRUNKS and COKE FIENDS

In the middle of it all -- a 15-piece JAZZ BAND all black We
land on a trumpeter -- 20’s handsome his playing as feverish as
the crowd This is SIDNEY PALMER A few feet away a 500-POUND
WOMAN is wrestling and beating the shit out of two MALE GUESTS
She BULLDOZES them into the bandstand wood-chips flying and blood
spewing -- but Sidney just keeps playing unfazed nonchalantly
stepping to the left to avoid the BRAWL casually ducking while a
CHAIR sails through the air Never misses a beat

WE WHIP PAN BACK -- to Manny eyes peeled for a CHICKEN passing a
WOMAN walking a MAN in a HORSE’S MASK on a leash a GUEST Peter-
Panning into a table a DRUNK WOMAN tumbling down the stairs as --

LADY
Oh I’m so sorry

A LADY in her 70’s has just cut off his path Half-hidden behind a
purple chiffon veil a world apart from the crowd she stares at
Manny like an eagle -- swallowing him whole in her gaze For him
this sudden apparition is almost too much to take in at once Her
name is ELINOR ST JOHN and with her milk-pale skin fire-red
hair and blue eyes so sharp and cutting they could slice through
glass she’s some strange inimitable mix of majesty and madness

ELINOR ST JOHN
Would you mind showing me to the
upstairs powder room my boy

MANNY
Uh -- sure -- it’s -- down the hall --

ELINOR ST JOHN
No Upstairs

MANNY
The stairs are pretty steep --

ELINOR ST JOHN
I can be carried

Manny looks at her And then suddenly intervening --
EMPLOYEE

Evening Madame lovely to see you
I have to steal him I’m afraid --
The EMPLOYEE -- his name’s JIMMY -- HURRIES Manny off --
JIMMY
What did you say to Elinor
MANNY
Who
JIMMY

Elinor St John

(then seeing something else

he needs to run off to --)
Look -- never speak to her If she
ever tries to talk to you again
pretend you don’t understand English

Jimmy rushes off Manny takes a second to process when --

FRANTIC GUEST
That chicken stole my fucking coke

Manny turns -- sees the CHICKEN now covered in white powder
running around like crazy It races past a TUX-CLAD MAN with blood
on his face Manny DIVES for it -- manages to GRAB it But it’s

PISSED Starts PECKING and CLAWING at him --

MANNY
AUUUGGGHHH -- PUTA --

Manny holds onto it struggling in pain as he staggers back into --
-- ELINOR ST JOHN -- now armed with a pen and notepad

ELINOR ST JOHN
So I should assume upstairs is where
Don keeps his underage girls then

Manny HURRIES away from Elinor -- makes it to the DOOR with the
drug-crazed chicken still in his grip (barely) and slips out --
just missing a flying CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE as it CRASHES against the
wall behind him and as the band’s song comes to a roaring CLOSE

EXT DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 8
Quiet Manny lowers the angry chicken to the ground It runs away
He breathes out spent Finally has a moment Lights a cigarette

Notices a little blood on his hand where he got clawed Sighs

A new song begins inside -- a ballad Manny looks back at the
house -- the rich guests The world he’s not a part of

BAM A car SMASHES into statuary behind Manny He SPINS around
The statue topples and SHATTERS -- and the driver EXITS

Short mid-20’s crazily mussed hair Jersey accent -- and
spitfire energy A dynamo with a chip on her shoulder the size of
Gibraltar and a hunger that will never let up Moving through the
wreckage of a 500-year-old statue she’s the only thing worth
watching This is NELLIE LaROY and she demands your full
attention

NELLIE
Well that came out of fuckin nowhere

SECURITY GUARD
Youll have to pay for that ma’am

NELLIE
Oh yeah And who the fuck are you

SECURITY GUARD

NELLIE

SECURITY GUARD

NELLIE

SECURITY GUARD
There’s no “Nellie LaRoy” on the list

NELLIE

SECURITY GUARD

SECURITY GUARD

NELLIE

Manny takes it in Nellie grazes her hand on a lamp

NELLIE (CONTD)

Levine exits looking for Manny We PAN -- to a car we recognize
The CONVERTIBLE In it are a WOMAN -- INA -- and her HUSBAND who
leans back in the driver’s seat sunglasses hiding his eyes a
martini in one hand and a cigarette in the other

This is JACK CONRAD 50 but ageless Think 70’s Nicholson crossed
with Mastroianni at peak cool plus a dash of Willy Wonka Despite
an air of wry bemusement at the circus around him he makes sure

to treat that circus with grace -- like a gentleman would Yet at
every instant he seems to know there’s somewhere else -- if only
in a dream -- that’s far more magical

INA JACK

Another one gone Oh well The show goes on Heads to the house --

SECURITY GUARD JACK (CONTD)

A little way’s away -- by the hill’s edge -- a SILHOUETTED FIGURE
IS CRAWLING OUT OF A BUSH It’s a WOMAN She EMERGES from the
foliage covered in twigs and leaves and dust and scratches -- has

obviously CLIMBED OVER A MILE and then HIDDEN for her moment --
and is now RUNNING LIKE THE WIND ITSELF STRAIGHT TOWARD JACK

All the way from Old Shanghai -- the

Exotic Sexation -- that Emerald of

the East -- that Ornament of the

Orient -- the Rose Petal of the

Rising Sun -- Miss Lady Fay Zhu
From behind the bandstand emerges LADY FAY ZHU -- now in FULL
TUXEDO AND TOP HAT A hush falls over the crowd Fay takes a drag
from a cigarette coyly eyes the audience -- then starts to SING

in a come-hither Chinese accent

LADY FAY ZHU
There’s one pet I like to pet
Ev’ry evening we get set
I stroke it ev’ry chance I get
It’s my girl’s pussy

The audience ERUPTS Fay’s voice stays soft calm teasing

LADY FAY ZHU (CONT’D)
Seldom plays and never purrs
And I love the thoughts it stirs
But I don’t mind because it’s hers
It’s my girl’s pussy

(more cheers)

And while often it goes out at night
It’s always back before the light
No matter what the weather’s like
We always have a ball

(MORE )

LADY FAY ZHU (CONT’D)
It’s never dirty always clean
In giving thrills it’s never mean
But it’s the best I’ve seen and I’ve
seen ‘em all

She SLINKS off the stage She moves like WATER -- ebbing and
flowing past the tables her eyes slowly roving She stops at a
COUPLE on a couch Leans over fondles the MAN’s tie -- then turns
to face the WOMAN -- slowly bends toward her face --

-- and gives her along sensuous KISS A rest in the music The
crowd holds its breath Fay leans back -- the Woman she kissed is
in a daze -- and EXHALES cigarette smoke

The MUSIC returns The crowd CHEERS Fay smiles tips her hat

starts heading back to the stage as the Woman blushing holds her
face in her hands

LADY FAY ZHU (CONT’D)
‘Cause I’1l do anything for this sweet

pet
I’1l lend a hand if it gets wet
It works me to a sweat -- and that’s

hard to do
(regains the stage)
I bring tidbits that it loves
And we spoon like turtle doves
I must first remove my gloves
(removes her gloves)
--When stroking my girl’s pussy

A WINK and she’s done Big APPLAUSE
Sidney and Fay share a look She leans over to him and whispers

LADY FAY ZHU (CONT’D)
Did I sound ok

SIDNEY
Just like a lady

They go way back We notice -- Fay’s accent is gone

CUT TO Fay now HIGH as a kite leaning back in an armchair with18
a BANDAGE on her arm

Jack sashays over to her drunker than before --

I love this song

It’s a new TUNE Nellie rushes onto the dance floor flings off
her jacket starts moving WILDLY Grabs Manny’s hand dances with
him is all over him seems ravenous for him -- but soon her
thoughts and eyes start racing elsewhere She’s got work to do

She PULLS AWAY Dances over to another MAN Drapes her arms around

him The Man gets excited leans in for a KISS -- but Nellie
skirts away from him Dances over to the COP from the road -- now
drunk off his mind Gets him salivating -- then moves on Makes

out with an ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY (the Cop’s cousin’s son can’t
believe his luck) Then a MAN IN DRAG Then a procession forming
behind her she returns to Manny -- beckoning him to join the
parade But Manny RESISTS now

Nellie moves on -- and one reveler after another follows or swarms
her A scantily-clad WOMAN tries to dance with Manny -- but he’s
not interested Watches Nellie as she mounts a TABLETOP Watches
as PEOPLE at other tables start grabbing at each other and tearing
at outfits A COUPLE their faces smeared with coke start fucking
in the open Another COUPLE collapses atop a CAKE as they go at
it The music BUILDS in intensity as the whole place starts to
look like an ORGY -- with Nellie a mad conductor presiding over it
all and Manny and a sea of drunkards utterly mesmerized by her

LEVINE (0S)
You I’ve been looking all over for you

Manny turns around startled It’s Levine -- and he’s pissed

LEVINE (CONTD)
We’ve got a serious fucking situation

INT BEDROOM - DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 19

Manny Levine and Jimmy huddle around the blood-streaked and
unconscious Jane She occasionally TREMORS

LEVINE (CONTD)
There’s no exit except down the main
staircase

MANNY
Nothing in the back

LEVINE
No you gotta go through the
ballroom Everyone will see her

MANNY
Is there a doctor

LEVINE

Manny thinks Then gets an idea

MANNY

(off the others’ confused looks --)

We bring him through the front
Everyone will look at him No one

Levine considers Checks his watch

LEVINE

It’s only two Don wanted to save the

elephant
Manny looks at him A beat
LEVINE (CONTD)
Fine Get the wrangler Jimmy you
carry the girl with me then you
drive her to the hospital

Jimmy nods Manny hurriedly EXITS Then --

JIMMY
Doubt she’1l be able to work LEVINE
tomorrow --— That’s her fucking problem
JIMMY
Uh no she’s in the bar scene in
“Maid’s Off”

Levine turns to him Suddenly pale A beat

LEVINE
Are you sure

JIMMY
(Opens Jane’s purse)
Yeah Jane Thornton That’s her
(then )
Bar shoots tomorrow doesn’t it

Levine lowers his head into his hand A beat

LEVINE
Yes

Softly --

A moment of silence Then everything exploding now --

LEVINE (CONTD)
WHO THE FUCK INVITED HER

Beat We see a FAT ARM slowly rise up behind Levine and Jimmy

ORVILLE PICKWICK
Um I did

Orville is seated on the floor Now Levine really loses it

LEVINE ORVILLE PICKWICK (CONTD)
You fucking blimp I’m sorry Bob It was her
motherfucker piece of fat first movie role she wanted
fucking shit -- to celebrate

Levine starts BEATING THE SHIT out of Orville now --

LEVINE
I’1l fucking kill you you dough-boy

Goodyear so they can add you to their
fucking zeppelin fleet

Jimmy finally manages to PULL Levine off Orville -- now a
whimpering pile of tears Levine red-faced EXITS the room --

-- BUSTS out into the HALLWAY -- toward the RAILING -- LOOKS at
the MELEE down below -- THE CAMERA SWIRLS THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
RUSHING US PAST -- a MAN going down on a WOMAN on the floor --
another WOMAN shoving a champagne bottle up a MAN’s ass -- another
MAN hopping around and shouting in a bad Irish accent --

MAN SHOUTING IN BAD IRISH ACCENT
Oy where is me pot of gold

-- AND FINALLY LANDING -- on Nellie Still perched atop a table
her dancing as crazed and sexed as ever

LEVINE

(points as Jimmy hurries over)
Whoever she is We go with her tomorrow

That’s that WE SMASH TO --

INT BALLROOM - DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 20
The front doors BURST open -- and the ELEPHANT stomps on in All
eyes turn It’s a sight to behold -- its giant frame barely
fitting through the faux-medieval doorway its trunk reaching the
ceiling as the Wrangler -- holding hay and stained in shit --

guides it into the BALLROOM

We SPOT Jack and Jen fucking in an alcove above -- in their own
world the elephant parading in the background the band playing
CIRCUS MUSIC now -- while Levine and Jimmy CARRY the unconscious

Jane down the staircase and out the back No one notices
INT BALLROOM - DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - A FEW HOURS LATER 21

The party has wound down Confetti and streamers on the floor The
musicians play a languid bittersweet tune We see

-- George Munn and Lady Fay dancing Fay holding George sweetly
tenderly George in a state of absolute bliss

-- Orville now painted up as a clown drinking and crying

-- Elinor St John in the corner watching as a HOSTESS wheels a
snack tray past On it needles and heroin A few GUESTS partake

-- Jack slumped in his seat almost comatose now a dozen empty
bottles in front of him He gazes at the BAR no longer manned A
look of wild ambition seizes him as slurring to himself --

JACK
Alright Captain Just one more
drinkfor old time’s sake
(hoists himself up -- then
falls back against his seat)

Aye Ok ok Puedes hacerlo

One last stand Like Clemenceau
(another try -- almost falls again
but steadies himself -- clicks
into position and one step at a
time --)

That’s it Caesar at Carthage

Napoleon at Austerlitz andyou at

this bar Once more unto the breach

pendejos Uno Dos Tres

He moves at a GLACIAL PACE -- like a not-great tightrope walker --
yet somehow despite his stupor he’s the image of a gentleman
Hand to waist posture perfectly upright an air of old nobility
and weathered grace as he inches his way to the bar straightening
his tie as he converses with himself in snippets of gibberish

JACK (CONTD) MANNY (0S)
All the balloons say hello Sir

WE’RE ON Levine now finally calm Manny has approached

MANNY (CONTD)

(while Jack continues in the bg)
Thank you for the work sir I wondered
if perhaps next time you or Mr Wallach
might have something for meon a set

MANNY (CONTD)

Levine thinks Sees a PARTYGOER pissing in the corner

That line hits Manny in the gut He keeps it in Turns -- and
SPOTS Nellie At a POKER TABLE with FIVE HANDSOME MEN Jimmy’s
just arrived hands Nellie some paper
JIMMY

Nellie BEAMS Drops her chips blows a KISS to the MEN --

NELLIE

The ELEPHANT’s eyes are now closed Nellie approaches it taken by
the sight Caresses it then tenderly whispers to it

NELLIE (CONTD)
«-You poor angel They shouldn’t do

Nellie kisses its trunk -- then runs out through a side door --
EXT DON WALLACH’S HOUSE - DAWN 22
NELLIE (CONT’D)

She CACKLES with laughter as Manny exiting after her approaches

slowly now It’s dawn outside -- a cool blue light settling in
MANNY NELLIE (CONTD)
Nellie Hey Josie Hey Nana Why

Angeleno hooch huh

MANNY (IN SPANISH) NELLIE (CONTD)

With that she LEAPS into her dented CAR REVS the engine --

NELLIE (CONTD)
Night honey

-- and SURGES backward CRASHING into the house Metal CRUNCHES

NELLIE (CONTD)
Don’t worry the car’s not mine

She TURNS and SPEEDS off You’ve never seen anyone drive so fast
or so violently Manny watches Is left alone Again

The car pulls into a Mediterranean-Revival-style ESTATE Manny

JACK

Manny nods Ok Suddenly -- Jack BREAKS FREE AND INTO A RUN
INT EXT JACK CONRAD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 26

A cavernous marble-floored interior BOLTING IN wide awake --

JACK (CONTD)
How ‘bout some music

-- Jack SPEEDS past Manny to a Victrola LOUD OPERA SWELLS

JACK (CONTD)

(singing along and conducting)
“Guarda il mare come 6 beeellooooo
Spira tanto sentimeeeeeeento” You
‘magine me at the opera That
would’ve made Ina’s folks happy huh

Within seconds Jack has removed his jacket and shirt

JACK (CONTD)
Now if you’1ll excuse me -- I’m gonna
go take a piss

He disappears The opera can be heard everywhere -- one speaker
per room Manny takes it in Hears Jack urinate while BELTING --

JACK (0S) (CONT’D)
“Senti come lieve saaaaaaaaaaaale”
(then )
Ina’s mom always told her “I don’t
see how you can marry a man who paints
his face -- period” See my point

A pair of shoes FLIES from the doorway Jack then re-emerges now
shoeless slipping off his pants Dramatically tosses them as
well Manny wonders for a second if Jack’s going to fully undress

JACK (CONTD)
Want some almonds

MANNY JACK (CONTD)
I think I should take you (wolfing down almonds)
to bed Mr Conrad -- Back off I’m not that easy
Jack lights a cigarette opens a drawer -- pulls out a GUN

JACK (CONTD)
Watch this Buffalo Bill gave it to me

He puts one arm over both his eyes unsteadily aims the gun --
Manny goes wide-eyed holy shit -- Jack FIRES BAM We hear glass
shatter off-screen Jack uncovers his eyes

JACK (CONTD)
Yep still got it

Slams the gun down on the table Devours more almonds then PUSHES
OPEN a pair of doors -- revealing a BALCONY overlooking the hills
28A

JACK
They’d’ve preferred me as a “legit”
you know “Legits” have class

Then -- suddenly seized with inspiration a fire in his eyes --
Jack turns around and GRABS Manny by the collar

JACK (CONT’D)
But you know what we have to do right

He steps atop a wobbly table and in boxers gesticulating with
the almonds and a cigarette half to the hills and half to Manny --

JACK (CONTD)

We have to redefine the form The man
who fills your gasoline tank goes to
the movies ‘cause he feels less alone
there Don’t we owe him more than the
same old shit You got the guys in
Europe with the twelve-tone you got
Bauhaus architecture -- know what I
mean fucking Bauhaus -- and we’re
still doing costume pictures It’s
the dinosaurs kid -- the ones who get
together for fucking meatballs and
margaritas in Beverly Hills to
reminisce about the good ol’ days when
they can’t see there is SO MUCH MORE
TO BE DONE

(stomping with emphasis now)
We need to innovate We need to
inspire We need to dream beyond these
pesky shells of flesh and bone -- map
those dreams onto celluloid -- imprint
them into history -- turn today into
tomorrow so that tomorrow’s lonely man
might look up at that flickering
screen and say for the very first
time -- “Eureka I am not alone”

At that point the table BUCKLES violently CHUCKING him left
causing him to SOMERSAULT BACKWARDS over the balcony railing and
PLUMMET through a tree and INTO THE ABYSS

MANNY (IN SPANISH)

OH MY GOD Jiiiiiiliiliiliiliiiiiiiiiil
Manny -- apoplectic he’s just witnessed the death of Jack fucking
Conrad -- RACES down an outside staircase to the body --

-- to find Jack emerging from a SWIMMING POOL totally unfazed

JACK
I’m going to bed

A few cuts on his back Jack marches into a BEDROOM by the deck
PLOPS into bed immediately PASSING OUT Manny catches his breath
Jesus Christ

A beat Manny gazes at his surroundings A vast lawn stretching
from the house Horse stables A garden with a Roman fountain The
OPERA audible everywhere speakers on poles dotting the terrain

Manny hears -- RUSHES to the BEDROOM Jack points to him

JACK (CONTD)

Manny is speechless Does that mean what he thinks it means

JACK (CONT’D)

You ever been on a movie set

Manny nods “no” Looks suddenly emotional Slowly sits down in the

nearest chair Jack closes his eyes drifts back to sleep as --
JACK

some advice You know all the young up-

for the part in my movie Who do you
suggest Why discovery Well because
the role requires real range Gloria --
a range I just don’t think any of
today’s stars is capable of sadly

(a SPEAR BURSTS through the tent

within inches of his head)

Excuse me

(yelling out through the opening)
PROPS NEED BETTER AGING GODDAMNIT WE

TALKED ABOUT THIS

Oh no I didn’t mean your range is --
youve got a lot of charm But this is
real drama we’re talking about Gloria
Shakespeare-level stuff not a light
breezy comedy No of course you can
do Shakespeare-level stuff I didn’t mean
that You’d be great in one of his

fluffier plays

Gloria youre taking

it the wrong way -- this role requires
youth -- someone who has their whole life
ahead of them Well Geez this is a
bit awkward Oh well I’m glad you’d like
to work with me I’1l let you know when a
role that suits your range comes my

way No impossible as I said it’s
gotta be a discovery we couldn’t pay
star fees even if we wanted to Oh

to the studio I’m not making any
promises but I’1l try my best Bye now

Warner Theatre

And slowly WE DISSOLVE TO

INT WARNER THEATRE - NIGHT 118

The MOVIE has already begun We don’t see what’s onscreen Manny
enters Finds a seat Someone is SINGING but Manny barely
notices He smiles He’s in love We can make out some of the
lyrics he isn’t listening to “He’s an angel Of joy”
Playing back the conversation he and Nellie just had in his head
Manny leans backthen hears LOUD APPLAUSE

He shifts in his seat Notices -- the WOMAN next to him is
CHEERING The MAN next to her as well A WAVE OF HOSANNAS rolls
over from behind Manny turns around Follows the applause with
his ears and eyes CLAMOR sweeps in from the front of the theater
now too -- hands CLAPPING everywhere a CHORUS of “Bravo”s

Finally Manny rises from his seat The entire theater packed is
ROARING A thunderous OVATION He’s never seen anything like it
He looks ahead -- and WE PAN to finally SEE what’s on the SCREEN

It’s FOOTAGE of a PACKED CLUB It’s like a mirror of the Warner
Theatre full of PEOPLE APPLAUDING And in the center -- AL JOLSON
as a SINGER waving his hands at the FANS -- and then exclaiming
out loud

AL JOLSON (ONSCREEN)
Wait a minute Wait a minute You
ain’t heard nothin yet

We PAN BACK to the AUDIENCE -- even more amazed now And to Manny
-- eyes on the screen then eyes on the audience then back on the

screen -- taking in the spell that’s being cast

AL JOLSON (ONSCREEN) (CONTD)
Wait a minute I tell ya You ain’t
heard nothin You wanna hear “Toot
Toot Tootsie” Alright hold on

Jolson launches into “Toot Toot Tootsie” The audience bob their

heads tap their feet Manny can feel it -- the electricity in the
theater

and the ground permanently shifting beneath him

He turns and HURRIES for the exit We FOLLOW him as his FAST WALK

gradually builds into a RUN -- out through the LOBBY

EXT WARNER THEATRE - NIGHT 119
and right to the PAYPHONE He speedily dials -- as our SHOT
reveals a BILLBOARD just above -- and the film’s title visible

for the first time “THE JAZZ SINGER”

MANNY
Jack It’s me again

WE SMASH CUT TO
INT SOUND BOOTH - DAY 120
BLACK Then a MICROPHONE is dipped into frame It’s big and odd
May 1928

We PAN to a trembling ACTRESS holding a sheet of paper She looks
up as though for a signal Then begins reading into the mike

ACTRESS (BOBBIE HART)
“Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep
And doesn’t know where to find them”

DON WALLACH (PRELAP )
Here’s what we’ve decided to do

EXT FIELD - KINOSCOPE PICTURES - DAY
Don Wallach is addressing a field full of CONTRACT PLAYERS

DON WALLACH (CONTD)
I know you’re busy right now A lot
of shows shooting I get it I know
sitting here discussing sound might
not seem top of the agenda But with
“Lion and the Mouse” about to open I
think it’s important to address on
the off chance the “talker” proves
more than just a fad Which I doubt
it will So here goes

INTERCUT W SOUND BOOTH MORE ACTORS READING “LITTLE BO PEEP”

ORVILLE PICKWICK
Leave them alone and they’1ll come home
Bringing their tails behind them

DON WALLACH
Every contract player here will record
a sound test This is pure formality

ACTRESS (LUPE MORALES)
(thick Spanish accent)
Little Bo Peep fell fast asleep
And dreamt she heard them bleating

DON WALLACH
Over the next week we’ll announce a
few films with speaking interludes
Not too many We don’t want to overdo
this or it’1ll cease to be a novelty

ACTOR (OLAF LUDVIGSEN)
(thick Danish accent)
But ven zee avoke zee found it a joke
For zey vere still a-fleeting

DON WALLACH
To be clear -- none of this affects
anything we are currently shooting
All current movies continue as
scheduled This is just precaution
and just while the talking fad lasts

And now were ON NELLIE in the SOUND BOOTH the paper in hand

NELLIE
Sheheaved a sigh andwiped --
wiped her eye

Her speech is hesitant halting She’s not the best reader

NELLIE (CONT’D)
And over the hillsover the hill-
ocks went ramblin

She hears PENCILS scratching Looks up -- to a group of SOUND
ENGINEERS listening to her and taking notes She feels
instantly self-conscious Feels them judging her Nerves start
spiking She begins to STAMMER

NELLIE (CONTD)
Andtr--tried what she c--could
as aShep-herd-essshould

To tack each again to its 1-lamb-kin

She’s done Scrunches her eyes “Lambkin” Then looks back up

NELLIE (CONTD)
Alright we through Yeah Good
(tosses the paper)
And “lambkin” is a retarded word

Off that --

BANDLEADER (0S)
And now Miss Lady Fay Zhu will choose
a partner

-- and a new cue begins An ERHU starts playing Sidney and the
Saxophonist regain the stage

OMIT 125

The erhu now gives way to a TANGO as Fay looking like a goddess26
glides through the crowd eyeing the guests We PAN OFF to find
-- Nellie again now on her own eyeing someone -- her dad who’s
sidling up to a GIRL even younger than she and making a move he’s
clearly practiced a lot

ROBERT BOW
Hi I’m Nellie LaRoy’s dad Rob Roy
She added the “La” What’s your name

Off Nellie her anger and disgust building we return to -- Fay
slinking like a hunter past a few MEN a few WOMEN before finally
landing on

Nellie

Fay looks at her Nellie turns and looks at Fay What A beat
Then -- Fay TAKES Nellie’s hand and -- to Nellie’s shock -- PULLS
her onto the DANCE FLOOR As the entire crowd GAPES --

-- Nellie and Lady Fay DANCE

Nellie doesn’t know what’s happening For the first time we see
her in the grip of someone else’s eroticism Fay is in control
Holds Nellie tight Moves her across the floor Runs her hand down
Nellie’s BARE BACK brings her in CLOSE -- ‘til the two can taste
each other’s BREATHS -- while outside the nearest DOOR --

-- Manny watches it all Still pissed at how Nellie treated him --
yet all the same wishing he were Lady Fay

Jack pops out of the door behind Manny -- now drenched

JACK
I need your help He’s getting aggressive

BACK TO NELLIE AND FAY Their DANCE growing more and more heated
more and more charged Hands CLASPED eyes LOCKED -- Fay
unwavering Nellie still nervous -- pulses rising sweat trickling
-- an electric current between them

Fay PULLS Nellie even CLOSER -- their faces now TOUCHING

Fay CLOSES her eyes -- LEANS in -- lips NEARING Nellie’s
Nellie’s BREATHING so fast -- what is happening

She closes her eyes as well -- the moment is here we can feel it

-- hearts pounding nerves firing they’re about to KISS when --

FOOTBALLER 2

-- ONE OF THE FOOTBALLERS CHARGES RIGHT INTO THEM DRUNK

Tries to do a cannonball into the pool but crash-lands onto the
curb instead Starts writhing in pain

Nellie STARTLED out of her reverie blinks Then -- as if having
abruptly awoken from a spell -- she DASHES away

We TURN to Fay -- visibly disappointed

even more plastered than before approaches the bandstand

The VOICES drift away We linger on Nellie The viciousness has
shocked her She finds herself trembling And for a moment TEARY

No Fuck that She wipes the tears away But they keep coming She
goes to the sink Rinses her face again -- washing the tears off

CLAMPS ITS FANGS right into her flesh

NELLIE (CONTD)
AAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH i

The revelers go APESHIT Even more so when -- THE SNAKE WON’T LET
GO Its fangs STAY in Nellie’s neck its TAIL GYRATING as Nellie
SCREAMS like a banshee and RUNS in circles

NELLIE (CONTD)

Her arms FLAIL and GRASP in vain at the won’t-let-go Snake as --

MANNY SPRINGS INTO ACTION -- pure instinct must save the day --
RUNS forward faster than he’s ever run charging like a soldier
into the fray -- LUNGES at the Snake with all his energy GRABS
its tail with all his strength --

MANNY
I got i--

-- but the tail SLIPS out of his grasp and WHIPS him across the
face with what feels like the force of a truck He immediately

DOUBLES backward and HITS the ground knocked out

ELINOR ST JOHN FOOTBALLER 3
Good God someone get help Were miles from anything
Nellie starts running FASTER -- it’s as though the snake bite has
injected ADRENALINE into her veins -- she’s a fucking hurricane
now -- BARRELING right for --

-- George who starts FLEEING and SCREAMING the toilet seat
gyrating around his neck -- he TRIPS and violently FALLS -- as
from the car freaking the fuck out --

ESTELLE

But Jack doesn’t seem to hear Estelle at all He just STANDS IN
PLACE watching the insanity as if from a remove -- as if an

audience member at a movie All the folks around him lose their
shit -- but all he does is break into a faint wistful smile

The cacophony FADES OUT replaced by the SOFT SOUND of a portable
Victrola in one of the cars An oboe soloing over a BITTERSWEET
JAZZ TUNE Jack -- completely zoned out his eyes staring off
into the vast distance -- stays still and takes it all in

We SEE what he SEES -- the herd of revelers running and screaming
-- but without sound just the music scoring them They look
somehow disembodied now -- like spirits acting out some danse
macabre in the dawn desert light

Jack casts his gaze downward as if thinking of something -- as if
experiencing a moment of sublime clarity

The smile fades Melancholy takes hold And finally -- at last
breaking through the quiet and REACHING HIM --

grasping at the Snake -- and -- CLICKING HIS BACK INTO POSITION --
JACK
Once more unto the breach dear friends

-- he RUNS toward Nellie without hesitation -- eyes on the Snake

he’s going to take it down --

JACK (CONTD)
iMUERE HIJO DE PUTA

-- WHEN HE’S SUDDENLY SIDESWIPED BY ONE OF THE CARS A frantically
FLEEING Footballer’s at the wheel Jack’s BODY SLAMS AGAINST THE
WINDSHIELD -- ROLLS ACROSS THE TOP -- BOUNCES OFF LIKE A RAG DOLL
-- LANDS WITH A VIOLENT THUD ON THE GROUND He’s out cold

ESTELLE
OH MY GOD --

Nellie starts FOAMING AT THE MOUTH while Estelle runs to Jack The
pissed-off Snake just RATTLES more and more feverishly -- Nellie’s
eyes ROLL BACK her face going pink and purple she’s on death’s
door now -- one Footballer starts WEEPING -- another just starts
VOMITING -- it’s the most hopeless of shitshows -- until finally -

LADY FAY ZHU
For fuck’s sake

-- FED UP with everything Fay -- who has somehow remained cool
through all of this -- reaches into one of the cars leans back
out with a SMALL KNIFE calmly walks up to Nellie --

-- and SLICES the Snake in HALF in one fell swoop

MEN

Blood GUSHES like a geyser The Snake’s still-gyrating TAIL falls
to the sand -- the HEAD still attached to Nellie’s neck

Nellie COLLAPSES to the ground PASSED OUT Fay SPRINGS atop her
and GRABS with her bare hands the top and bottom of the Snake’s
MOUTH -- PULLS with all her might -- PRIES open the Snake’s JAW --

RAMS it open til it SNAPS -- CHUCKS the Snake’s DECAPITATED HEAD
and leans into the BITE MARKS They’re puss-filled bubbling

Fay PRESSES her mouth to the bite marks -- and SUCKS The others
watch all of this in awe -- their eyes going wider and wider as
Fay sucks and spits sucks and spits -- sucking all the venom out
Finally Fay stops Pulls back Takes a breath A beat

It’s done

She procures a small flask of whiskey from under her dress Takes
a swig to swish out her mouth -- then DOUSES the rest of the
bottle right onto Nellie’s wound as disinfectant

Nellie SPRINGS AWAKE -- the pain from the alcohol’s sting SURGING
through her CATAPULTS up to a seated position GASPING for air
and in a total DAZE

A long beat Fay looks at Nellie Nellie’s eyes shake -- then
slowly settle onto Fay

Another beat

And then -- without blinking -- as if on autopilot -- Nellie
LUNGES FORWARD at lightning speed -- GRABS Fay’s face --

-- and DECKS her with a full hot-and-heavy FRENCH KISS

This is the answer to their dance -- the kiss Fay never got With
that Nellie FALLS back against the ground -- and passes back out

Silence

WE SMASH CUT TO BLACK

INT SOUNDSTAGE - KINOSCOPE PICTURES - DAY 141

WE FADE IN on an interior shooting stage -- or “SOUNDSTAGE” as
it’s now called The first thing we notice is the silence A card

July 1928

This is the polar opposite of the shooting environments we’ve seen

before Gone is the hustle and bustle Gone are the movies

shooting simultaneously A few CREW MEMBERS sit and wait quietly --
already hot and sweaty The rest of the stage is completely empty

Another thing we notice -- the darkness The only light here is
artificial No open air no sunlight The walls are thick and
imposing the doors black slabs A red lamp hangs over each of the
doors and “SILENCE” signs are everywhere

The single movie set is of a COLLEGE DORM ROOM Hanging over it
from the rafters above -- is a GIANT MICROPHONE In front of the
set is a BIG WOODEN BOX with a sheet of GLASS Inside pointed
through the glass is the CAMERA Finally looming above also
enclosed in glass -- is the SOUND BOOTH where a sound engineer
LLOYD (from New York) sits at the ready hands on dials Something
about the whole set-up fills us with dread

NELLIE appears -- in costume as a new college freshman RUTH
approaches her MAX by her side In Nellie’s hands is something
else we haven’t seen before a SCRIPT

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
Welcome to the wonderful world of sound

We’re on MGM’s new SOUNDSTAGE -- an MC REHEARSING while MUSIC
BLASTS

FIND Manny -- hurrying to a CUTTING ROOM -- opening the DOOR -- to
FIND Jack inside seated in the dark hunched over a Moviola
watching a movie of a WOMAN in prayer his eyes trembling

MANNY JACK
Jack they’re ready for you Come look at this

Manny sees a CANISTER on the floor “THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC”

JACK (CONTD)
The entire movie is close-ups
Never been done before This is
what I’m talking about Real
innovation Poetry Why couldn’t we
get this guy to direct

MANNY
Dreyer He was unavailable He’s
making a movie about God

JACK MANNY (CONTD)
Of course he is Here’s your outfit

It’s a RIDICULOUS-LOOKING PINK SEE-THROUGH RAIN SLICKER AND HAT
WITH STRAPS Jack takes it but keeps his gaze on the Moviola -- so
moved by the footage that he’s teary-eyed

JACK
It’s just so goddamn beautiful

Manny looks as well A tear rolls down Joan of Arc’s face And off
Dreyer’s sublime image WE SMASH TO --

INT SOUNDSTAGE - MGM STUDIOS - MOMENTS LATER 145
-- A MASS of ACTORS in SLICKERS smiling like idiots and SINGING
ACTORS
I’m singin’ in the rain
Just singin’ in the rain
PAN to Jack -- watching in horror The ACTORS twirl UMBRELLAS

under a RAIN MACHINE in front of a painted backdrop of NOAH’S ARK
while BOBBING their heads back and forth with DEMENTED GRINS

JACK
Do I have to do this

GEORGE
What do you mean It’s gonna be
great

JACK

We just stand thereand sing

GEORGE
Exactly

JACK
While it rains

GEORGE
Yeah

JACK

Andthat’s Noah’s Ark

GEORGE
Um I believe so

JACK
because it’s raining so much

GEORGE
To be honest I’m not really sure why
Noah’s Ark is there

JACK GEORGE (CONTD)
George This is not what I Norma’s here Buster Keaton’s
had in mind when I said push here it’s -- publicity And
the medium forward the song’s a hit

Jack takes it in Finally as if for his friend --

JACK
Just make sure Olga doesn’t shoot me

-- he JOINS the ACTORS IN SLICKERS on-set

ACTORS
---and I’m happy again

They stand in formation under the RAIN MACHINE as a CAMERA shoots
the whole bizarre spectacle (Among them we spot Olga Putti --
GLARING at Jack)

We PAN off set --

-- toward an ORCHESTRA behind camera accompanying the song At
its center -- is Sidney on trumpet

WE CUT TO -- Manny Standing at the crafts table at the back of

the soundstage Silently processing everything he’s seeing He
glances over at the SOUND TECHNICIANS to his side All New York

accents Then back to the set -- as the rehearsal take ends

Thirty-second break CLOSE ON Sidney as he sets down his horn He
lets his eyes roam The lights the cameras Takes it in It’s new
to him Heads to pour a coffee while the ACTORS on set practice
their HEAD-BOBBING He watches them Grimaces Manny standing
nearby looks at him Notices

MANNY
What do you think

Sidney turns Looks at Manny Surprised to have been asked

SIDNEY MANNY (CONTD)
You’re asking what I think Yeah

SIDNEY
I think you got the camera pointed in
the wrong direction

With that Sidney returns to his horn -- and a new take BEGINS

AD (SAME AS STRASSBERGER’S) ACTORS
Action -- I’m singin’ in the rain

We STAY with Manny this time -- considering We SEE what he sees
-- the Noah’s Ark set the ACTORS singing and bobbing -- and
behind CAMERA the ORCHESTRA swinging away

It’s hard to deny The actors look absurd The orchestra doesn’t

Manny thinks Turns his attention solely to the orchestra An
IDEA crystallizing in his mind We PUSH IN on the musicians

and on Sidney looking (and sounding) like an absolute star
Manny’s eyes LOCK on Sidney and only Sidney -- and we’re --

INT NEW MOVIE SET - MGM SOUNDSTAGE - DAY 146

LEVINE
You know her don’t you
(Manny isn’t sure how to respond)
Her Jersey thing doesn’t work anymore
Today’s audiences find her pornographic
She owes gambling debts all over town
And she sounds like a donkey

Manny takes it in Levine looks at him

LEVINE (CONTD)
Anyway Think about it

And with that he walks off
We linger on Manny Thinking He turns -- sees Thalberg poke his

head out of the soundstage and greet Levine At Thalberg’s side is
a BEAUTIFUL STARLET Manny keys in on the STARLET as Thalberg

introduces her to Levine -- her coiffed hair her elegant clothes
her regal poise He processes WE PUSH IN ON HIM -- and --

her parts We fix her voice Elinor St
John writes a story about her amazing
transformation We get Nellie in front
of tastemakers like Hearst We get her
invited to San Simeon With the right
endorsements and with Elinor as an
ally we can remake Miss LaRoy into an
actress of sophistication like the
ladies of MGM and re-endear her to the
public

education to go to the theater so they
went to the vaudeville houses and then
they went to the nickelodeon and you
know what There’s beauty there What
happens on the screen means something
-- maybe not for you up in your ivory
tower but down on the ground where
real people live it means something

rabbit “Hey d’you ever have problems
with the shit stickin to your fur” The
rabbit finishes shittin and says “Nope
Inever do Why” And the bear says
“Fan-fuckin-tastic” And he grabs the

rabbit by the ears and --

Nellie GRABS the RABBIT FUR SHAWL off Mildred puts it between her
own legs -- and makes as though wiping her ass with it

Silence Everyone -- Hearst Mildred Elinor every single upper-
crust guest here -- stares at Nellie Appalled No more piano You

could hear a pin drop ON MANNY All he can do is close his eyes

ELINOR ST JOHN

NELLIE

Why not Haven’t you heard what they say
about me I’m a degenerate fuckin animal
“Oh Nellie well you know Nellie -- I
mean who knows what she might do She’s
from Jersey you know”

(then eyeing another food platter )
Well here’s what a degenerate fuckin
animal from Jersey does

She grabs a MOUNTAIN of BEEF TARTARE with her BARE HANDS and CHOWS
DOWN ON IT SHOVELS PLATEFULS right into her mouth An AVALANCHE
of RAW RED MEAT smears her face and slides down her throat People
stare in horror She SWALLOWS the last remnant

NELLIE (CONT’D)
That’s what the degenerate fuckin animal
from Jersey does In the meantime y’all
can keep on fuckin your cousins and
polishin your guest lists while you ply
your underaged fuckin mistresses with
Beaujolais ‘cause you know what -- I
know all of you And all you are is a
bunch of moralizin hypocrites who’ve done
worse than I have but won’t ever be
honest about it

(MORE )

NELLIE (CONTD)
So I’m gonna go home and stick some coke
up my pussy while all you fuckers can
stick your champagne flutes up your rose-
smellin candy-tastin Snow-White fuckin
assholes

With that she MARCHES off Manny takes it in Heartbroken It’s
over

Fleetingly he catches a look across the room -- from DON WALLACH
Standing there looking right at him Pissed

WE FOLLOW NELLIE TO THE DOOR Past the Bouncer down the outside

steps -- when suddenly she STOPS We see -- she’s gone green She
grabs her stomach -- then her mouth Then makes a decision
MARCHES back up the steps -- through the door clenching every-

thing in until she’s inside --
-- AND PROJECTILE VOMITS ALL OVER THE ROOM
It’s the most intense spewing geyser of vomit we have ever seen

A piece of every hors d’oeuvre we clocked earlier now sails across
the foyer The Klik6 rug is drenched in a mudslide of puke Nellie

keeps chucking -- Hearst out-of-body rushes forward -- and so
Nellie projectile-vomits on him Douses his tux and his face in
the remnants of the tartare After that -- SHE’S FINALLY DONE

A beat Then -- Nellie TAKES A BOW And walks out for good
One more glimpse of Manny -- silent -- and we’re --

The theater is full

JACK (ON-SCREEN)
Listen Catherine I don’t care if they
find us They could strip me of my rank
and it wouldn’t change how I feel

It’s the scene we saw being edited The frame is beautiful -- like
the one we saw Jack shoot years ago on the hilltop

This time there’s no score Instead we HEAR the lines the fabric
rustling the hands moving Jack looks every bit the star

JACK (ON-SCREEN) (CONTD)

entranced earlier crowds only now with sound --

-- THE AUDIENCE ERUPTS WITH HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER

ON JACK Stunned

He looks back up at the screen -- at himself completely laid

bare professing his love passionately kissing his leading lady --

as he has done for years And then again at the audience --
convulsing with laughs

We linger in WIDE SHOT on Jack Bewildered -- and CRUSHED

He hovers in place Then -- slowly -- he turns and walks away from

mistakes on those two movies I’m

Quiet We’re in Elinor’s office She’s at her desk Card 500 PM

JACK (0S)
Hi Madame

Elinor looks up Jack has entered He looks at her She looks at
him Beat He steps forward Pulls up a chair beside her desk

JACK (CONT’D)
Let’s have a talk

ELINOR ST JOHN
I’m on a deadline darling

But Jack doesn’t reply Just sits down across from Elinor She
looks at him again Stops typing Jack leans back In control

JACK (CONTD)

When I moved to LA you know what
the signs on all the doors said “No
actors or dogs allowed” I changed
that I helped build this place The
place you call home

(he pauses)
See -- I’ve been thinking about the
past lately Maybe I’m just getting
old But I’ve never had any illusions
about us I’ve never pretended we’re
friends You use me I use you Fine
That’s our work But this

(he holds up the PHOTOPLAY )
was something else

Elinor looks at the Photoplay A beat Then --

ELINOR ST JOHN
What do you want Jack

JACK
I want to know why you wrote it

ELINOR ST JOHN
No you want to know why they laughed

Jack looks at Elinor Caught off-guard

ELINOR ST JOHN (CONT’D)
Would you like me to tell you

JACK
Why they laughed Sure Enlighten me

ELINOR ST JOHN

There is no why

(a beat then )
It wasn’t your voice It wasn’t a
conspiracy and it certainly wasn’t
anything I wrote There’s nothing you
could have done differently and
nothing you can do Your time is up
There is no why Stop questioning it

JACK
--l’ve had a dry spell

ELINOR ST JOHN
No It’s over It’s been over for a
while I’m sorry

A beat Silence Jack doesn’t have a readymade comeback Something
about Elinor’s cool calm and brutal bluntness has made him pause

ELINOR ST JOHN
Come on Jack You knew this already
You knew it the minute they laughed

Jack looks back at Elinor -- a true contempt for her now curdling

JACK
Youre a cockroach Elinor

ELINOR ST JOHN
Maybe

Then -- Jack rises to his feet Flush with anger regaining
control now --

JACK
Let me explain something This isn’t
new to me I’ve been counted out befo--

ELINOR ST JOHN
Have you ever wondered why when a
house catches fire the people die and
the cockroaches survive

Jack stops Looks at Elinor His attention in her hands she now
rises as well Meets Jack’s gaze head-on If he’s going to be on
his feet -- so will she
A moment

ELINOR ST JOHN
What happened is you thought the house
needed you But it doesn’t It doesn’t
need you any more than it needs the
roaches So the roaches knowing this
crawl into the dark lay low and make
it through See you held the
spotlight but it’s those of us in the
dark -- the ones who just watched --
who survive

Silence Jack stands there Then --

JACK
-A house fire

ELINOR ST JOHN
There’11l be a hundred more like it
too An earthquake could wipe this
town off the map and it wouldn’t make
a difference It’s the idea that
sticks There’ll be a hundred more
Jack Conrads a hundred more me’s a
hundred more conversations just like

this one -- over and over again until
God knows when
(a beat and then the sinker --)

Because it’s bigger than you

We hold on Jack He remains stoic The same composed exterior But
Elinor keeps her gaze trained on him like a hawk as she slowly
steps closer to him zeroing in Looks him in the eyes -- can
suss out the pain And then in an almost tender tone of voice --

ELINOR ST JOHN (CONT’D)
I know it hurts No one asks to be
left behind But in a hundred years
when you and I are long gone anytime
someone threads a frame of yours
through a sprocket you will be alive
again You see what that means One
day every person in every film shot
this year will be dead And one day
those films will be pulled out of
vaults and all their ghosts will dine
together adventure together go to
the jungle or to war together

(MORE )

128A

ELINOR ST JOHN (CONT’D)

A child born in fifty years will
stumble upon your image flickering on
a screen and feel he knows you like a
friend though you breathed your last
before he breathed his first Youve
been given a gift Be grateful Your
time today is through but you’1l
spend eternity with angels and ghosts

Another moment Jack processes it all
A few seconds of silence

Elinor looks at Jack Jack looks at her A swirl of emotions on
his face Seems to weigh whether he has something to say

Another beat
Then -- he nods

Buttons his jacket Eyes Elinor once more --

JACK
Thank you for your time

-- and silently walks away

That’s that We linger here on Elinor alone now in the room
After a moment she returns to her desk sits back down

Out the nearest window a BRUSH LIZARD has appeared creeping
through the garden foliage Jack sees it watches it -- zeroing in
on just this creature and zoning out all the rest The lizard
pauses Turns Jack almost smiles A moment of true calm

Then the lizard scurries away Jack seems to hear the phone now

Ok we’re going to go again what I
want to see on the next take is

But as Jack watches him Lewis’s voice just gradually fades away --
buried by the sound of the waves the wind the air Then those
noises gradually fading as well Everything dissolving into
silence -- a moment suspended

Were reminded of Jack at the snake fight -- drifting into a kind
of reverie once again Lewis approaches him now seems to give him
notes for the next take But Jack can’t hear a thing He just
stares ahead Nods manages a smile Is on a different plane

He gazes backward -- toward and past the camera at the various
sights of the film set The GRIPS laying track The SCRIPT
SUPERVISOR jotting down notes The PA’s running coffees The
EXECS in the back one flirting with an EXTRA the other asleep
The banal machine of it all Jack observes as if from an
impossible distance -- as if able to see it clearly only now

just subtly -- off He’s talking with an ASSOCIATE of his when
we arrive

WILSON

McKay seems polite friendly The Associate quietly rises and
heads off as McKay motions to the now-empty seats

JAMES McKAY

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)

INT WILSON’S CAR - NIGHT 214

Manny and the Count are seated in the back of Wilson’s car Wilson
and McKay are in the front McKay’s face now lathered in makeup
the BAG on McKay’s lap Manny turns backward -- sees the lights of
the city recede into the distance as the car winds its way up the
hill and into dark forest

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
I had some ideas for Negro pictures
too ‘cause those seemed hot but I
just read the Negro vogue is over

Manny nods Can’t even listen Too filled with terror Eyes the
BAG on McKay’s lap -- THE BAG FILLED WITH PROP MONEY Wilson
drives further and further outside LA proper deeper and deeper
into wilderness Soon all you see out the window is PITCH BLACK
Manny eyes the Count This is so bad

EXT THE BLOCKHOUSE - OUTSKIRTS OF LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 215

Wilson’s car pulls into a lot -- outside an unadorned hole in a
hill in the middle of fucking nowhere This is THE BLOCKHOUSE

THE COUNT
Um What’s this

JAMES McKAY
Youve never been It’s great for a
night-cap They do all the stuff
here I can’t get away with even in
Cal-Neva anymore

Manny and the Count take this in Not reassuring Wishing they did
not have to they follow McKay and Wilson (who holds the BAG)

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Welcome to the asshole of Los Angeles

We ENTER Inside
INT THE BLOCKHOUSE - OUTSKIRTS OF LOS ANGELES - CONTINUOUS 216

is even worse Dark-red lighting MEN banging on thudding DRUMS
while two barely-clothed WOMEN viciously FIGHT each other inside a
CAGE and drug-addled SPECTATORS cheer A sign “WILD CAT COMBAT”

The WOMEN aren’t play-fighting they’re biting and tearing at each
other with CLAWS on their nails Blood SPEWS The SPECTATORS look

terrifying as well dope addicts junkies drugged and crazed

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
He’s two floors down Follow me

Shouting over the drums McKay gestures to a CRYPT-LIKE STAIRWELL

MANNY THE COUNT
We can wait here Yeah we’re good up here

JAMES McKAY
Trust me you got to see him perform

Every instinct in their bodies screaming at them to run Manny and
the Count instead follow McKay The STAIRWELL feels medieval cold
stone steps heavy walls moisture in the cracks They reach

the FIRST BASEMENT FLOOR The walls to the right are lined with
CHAINS and what look like medieval INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE an IRON
MAIDEN a RACK a SPIKED WHEEL On the other side behind BARS
are NAKED PEOPLE a few in GIMP MASKS some with bruises and
bleeding backs They clutch at the bars Some laugh others
whimper The walls here seem to be lined with EXCREMENT

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
One more floor

Manny and the Count share a look The Count’s just as terrified as
Manny at this point McKay walks ahead heading further down the
stairs Wilson follows him Manny and the Count follow Wilson The
deep thump-thump of the drums above recedes as our characters
descend We start to hear frenzied SHOUTS and CRIES We reach

-the SECOND BASEMENT FLOOR Here CIRCUS “FREAKS” (a BEARDED
LADY an ELEPHANT MAN and others) sit in cages or on leashes as
NAKED WOMEN take them out and FUCK them in front of ONLOOKERS

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Hm Not this floor either Wilson
isn’t he on tonight

WILSON
I thought he was

Manny watches as McKay and Wilson discuss -- while behind them
the crazed CROWD chucks dollar bills at a pair of SIAMESE TWINS
who are getting fucked by two WOMEN at the same time

MANNY
Um -- sir -- we’re -- we’re running
low on time actually so perhaps --

JAMES McKAY
Bullshit you came all the way out
here I promised you a sight youre
getting a sight Let’s try one more --

He heads back down the stairs Wilson looks at Manny and the Count
and nods for them to follow They do Down another flight of
stairs we go until the group reaches -- a DOOR It’s closed shut
McKay OPENS it -- it’s heavy -- and ushers the others through

Then lets the door slowly slide shut behind them Manny looks at
the door hoping to God it’s not locked As he and the Count step
out onto this BOTTOM BASEMENT FLOOR --

-- AN ALLIGATOR LUNGES RIGHT AT THEM

THE COUNT
Holy shit

Manny and the Count SPRING BACK McKay bursts into LAUGHTER

JAMES McKAY
Oh man Your faces

The ALLIGATOR is chained to the wall It settles down Glares at
Manny and the Count -- who clutch their chests feel their hearts

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Come on boys I think he’s on the
other side It’s worth it I promise

He starts walking down a long HALLWAY Manny and the Count beyond
shaken now follow We stay CLOSE on Manny -- red-eyed breathing
heavy Looks at his surroundings There are no windows at all The
ceiling is LEAKING in multiple spots dirty WATER dripping to the
floor which is dotted with PUDDLES He looks back at the DOOR to
the STAIRS Closed and growing smaller and smaller in his view

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Ah I hear them This way

McKay turns right The walls are now lined with MEDIEVAL WEAPONS --
SPEARS and SWORDS and SCYTHES Manny looks at them as he follows
until the few lamps are replaced by -- CANDLES Ink-black shadows

flickers of ochre light more leaks -- as NOISES become audible
The sounds of RATS scurrying And human sounds as well -- WHOOPS
and HOLLERS Louder and louder as we turn another corner

and find ourselves at the EDGE OF A CROWD The people here are
holding out CASH -- and look like the most fucked-up drugged-out
wasted-beyond-belief folks we’ve yet seen What’s more -- several
of them are packing GUNS

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Yes This is it

Manny’s eyes wander What the fuck is this place McKay cuts
through the crowd clearing a path for Manny and the Count to
follow Manny makes his way past more weapons on the walls
notices all the people are craning to see something -- but what

McKay and his group reach an open spot closer to the front Here
Manny can see what everyone’s trying to look at

Standing at the end of the hall side-lit by candles is a
GIGANTIC HUGELY BUILT MASKED MAN His skin is lathered in oil
His muscles bulge his veins pop He wears only a G-STRING and a
GREEK MASK His bare chest is dotted with flecks of BLOOD

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
That’s him Incredible isn’t he

The Masked Man flexes his biceps They’re huge The crowd cheers

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Watch what he does It has to be seen
to be believed

At that moment the Masked Man leans to his side -- and reaches
into a MEDIUM-SIZED BOX The crowd start throwing cash at him as
out of the box the Man slowly pulls

a live squirming RAT by its tail

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
(beyond excited)
Watch this

The Man LIFTS his mask -- at which point we see BLOOD on both his

chin and his lips Manny’s eyes widen as the Man lifts the RAT up
opens his jaw wide and starts to lower the animal into his mouth

Manny quickly LOOKS AWAY nauseous -- as the crowd ROARS

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Holy shit this guy Isn’t he amazing

A beat Manny tries not to vomit Turns back to see the Man lick
his freshly blood-streaked teeth and put the mask back on

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
They found him living in a forest in
Oregon He’ll do anything for cash
Wilson -- quick gimme a twenty

WILSON
I don’t have any on me

JAMES McKAY
The bag

Wilson opens the BAG -- takes out one of the WADS OF FAKE CASH
Manny holds his breath as Wilson pulls off the rubber band and
slips a FAKE 20 BILL out Hands it to McKay McKay takes it
rolls it up is about to chuck it at the Masked Man Hesitates --

-- then chucks it He fell for it Manny exhales Almost had a
heart attack He looks back at the Count The Count nods Manny
nods back Maybe they’1ll make it after all

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
Gimme another

Wilson slips out another 20 BILL hands it to McKay McKay is
about to roll this one up as well -- when a DROP OF WATER from one
of the ceiling leaks HITS it

Beat Manny looks at the Count The Count looks scared

McKay wipes the bill dry -- ok nothing has happened -- then seems
to notice something ODD Manny watches heart-rate rising as
McKay angles the bill to catch the nearest light The wet area of
the bill -- is turning MAGENTA

Manny’s blood freezes -- as McKay’s eyes drop Like a scientist
conducting an experiment McKay watches the hue change then turns
the bill upward lets the water run sideward

JAMES McKAY (CONTD)
It’s fake
(turns to Manny and the Count)
I thought we were friends
He seems genuinely hurt Manny panicking tries to protest --

MANNY
No no wait -- espere --

-- but Wilson is already reaching to pull out his GUN

Manny LUNGES at the nearest weapon -- one of the MEDIEVAL SPEARS
hanging on the wall -- YANKS the spear off --

-- and SWINGS it as hard as he can against Wilson’s head Blood
SPRAYS It’s messy as fuck SCREAMS ricochet FACES turn McKay
WHIPS out his own GUN now -- as do a bunch of the other ONLOOKERS
The Count starts wildly KICKING at them -- Manny WIELDS the spear
high SWINGING it back and forth like an insane person --

MANNY (CONT’D)
Back away BACK THE FUCK AWAY

-- keeps SWINGING -- CARVING his and the Count’s way through the
CROWD -- and then soon as he can -- he starts RUNNING LIKE MAD
Guns FIRE -- bullets PINGING off walls out of control -- Manny
and the Count FLEEING stone chips FLYING -- they RACE down the
hallway -- puddles SPLASHING -- almost at the DOOR -- nearly TRIP
over --

-- the ALLIGATOR Manny swerves reaches the DOOR -- then thinks

TURNS around -- SWINGS his spear against the latch connecting the
ALLIGATOR’s chains to the wall

Once twice -- THE LATCH BREAKS -- Manny and the Count OPEN the
door and RACE up the stairwell while the now-free ALLIGATOR LUNGES
at the PURSUING CROWD --

CROWD

Manny and the Count DART up one flight after another using the
few seconds of grace they’ve bought themselves --

-- PAST the CIRCUS FLOOR -- PAST the TORTURE FLOOR -- finally
REACHING the GROUND FLOOR the “WILD CAT COMBAT” area -- CHARGING
ahead Manny whipping the SPEAR through the air SCREAMING --

MANNY
iVUELVE HIJOS DE PUTA

They RACE past the CAGED FIGHTERS and the DRUMMERS and the JUNKIES
toward the ENTRY TUNNEL -- RUN into the darkness --

EXT THE BLOCKHOUSE - OUTSKIRTS OF LOS ANGELES - CONTINUOUS 217

-- and RUSH to Wilson’s car -- DIVE in -- KEYS are inside -- we
hear more GUNSHOTS -- the back WINDSHIELD shatters -- the car
starts we PEEL OFF -- CLOSE on Manny and the Count screaming
sweating Manny DRIVING as fast as possible into the night as
finally on this moment of pure adrenalized insanity WE SMASH TO

INT HOTEL LOBBY - SANTA BARBARA - NIGHT 218

A quiet gathering in a hotel lobby Jack’s seated with a BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN on his arm -- a new girlfriend Her name’s REBECCA LEWIS is
here as well plus a few other FRIENDS MUSIC plays

REBECCA
in August And then Jack said he’d
take me to Greece

LEWIS REBECCA (CONTD)
Greece Isn’t that right honey
JACK LEWIS
That’s right Youll love it Santorini
Then -- Jack spots someone he recognizes His eyes light up
JACK
Fay

She turns Dressed to the nines the very picture of elegance --

LADY FAY ZHU
Jack

JACK
Cara mia Folks Id like to introduce

Jacks companions nod smile seem to know who she is

LADY FAY ZHU REBECCA
How do you do Hello

JACK
What’s your excuse Passing through

LADY FAY ZHU
Something like that

JACK
I’1l get you a drink

MOMENTS LATER Jack and Fay are seated one on one Rebecca and
Lewis and the others swap jokes and laughs in the background --

but between Jack and Fay the mood is quieter The two of them
share wistful smiles -- the smiles of old friends

JACK (CONTD)
Were you shooting

LADY FAY ZHU
No Just wanted some air

JACK
And what’s next

LADY FAY ZHU
Going to Europe actually

JACK

LADY FAY ZHU

Fay smiles Grateful A beat

LADY FAY ZHU

Fay almost laughs A moment Jack smiles Shrugs

JACK (CONTD)
One more giant swing at mediocrity

LADY FAY ZHU
Well The girl seems nice

JACK
Eh That’ll go the same as all the

A beat Then looking at Fay --

JACK (CONTD)
We have fun We fuck like banshees stay
up all night but I don’t know
(then )
You want her

LADY FAY ZHU
(blushes laughs)
I’m ok thanks

A shared laugh A moment
Then -- quiet again Fay looks at Jack Seems to wonder

LADY FAY ZHU (CONT’D)

Jack looks at Fay Seems almost surprised by the question
Hesitates before responding
Then --

JACK
It was the most magical place in the
world Wasn’t it

A beat Fay surprised by the reply takes this in Nods

LADY FAY ZHU
It was

Jack nods back His thoughts drifting

JACK
I’ve been thinking on what to do I was
on set the other day and I started to
wonder I started to take some stock
I thought -- well I could go on
another set after this And if I’m
lucky another set after that But

(MORE )

JACK (CONTD)
(a beat)
I don’t know

He pauses Another beat Then he looks at Fay

JACK (CONTD)
I’m tired

A moment passes Silence Then shrugging --

JACK (CONTD)
The thing is it’s ok I was the
luckiest bastard in the world And I
had a good run

LADY FAY ZHU
You sure did

Jack smiles Nods

JACK
Yeah I enjoyed that

His thoughts drift some more Slipping into memory
Fay checks the time

LADY FAY ZHU
I gotta run sweetie

JACK
It was good seeing you Fay You’re
gonna do great things in Europe

LADY FAY ZHU JACK (CONTD)
Thanks Jack I’m rooting for you You’re
one of the good ones I’ve
met enough of ‘em to know

A beat They blow each other kisses

LADY FAY ZHU JACK (CONTD)
Ciao See you in Venice See you in
Prague

Fay heads off Nears the hotel’s revolving door to go outside --
but glances backward before she exits Sees through the fronds of
a potted palm Jack seated alone lost in thought Takes in the
sight -- then turns her coat collar upward and steps out into the
night

We return to Jack His thoughts seem to slowly resolve As if
something were dawning inside
150A

He rises Ambles back toward his group Leans in and gives Rebecca
a tender kiss

JACK (CONT’D)
I’m gonna go get those cigars

She barely registers him -- stays glued to a story Lewis is busy
telling We FOLLOW Jack up the nearest flight of stairs

Reaching the second floor he sees a YOUNG BELL HOP Stops him

JACK (CONTD)
Youre doing a great job kid

The Bell Hop looks at Jack Startled Jack grabs all the cash from
his pocket and plops it right into the Bell Hop’s hand

JACK (CONTD)
It’s on you now The future’s yours

Then he pats the kid on the back and continues on We FOLLOW --
keeping our distance watching Jack head to toe as he slowly
strolls down the hallway swaying a bit to the music from down
below whistling here and there The MUSIC seems for a moment to
swell to take on symphonic colors -- like an old silent-movie
orchestral score Jack hums some more conducts a bit as he walks
He seems content At ease A little Mastroianni a little Wonka --
like the Jack we first saw all those years ago

He reaches a door Unlocks it steps in We stay outside the
doorway -- peering in at an angle We can see a small sliver of
the room Jack exits frame The music continues -- lyrical
romantic

Jack crosses back into view We see him pull a small piece of
luggage from near his bed Out of it he procures a PISTOL -- the
same gun he showed Manny back in ‘26 -- the same one Olga used on
him in ‘27 We remain at a distance

Jack takes a moment Serene Then points the gun to his temple and
SHOOTS HIMSELF IN THE HEAD Collapses dead on the floor

We linger for a moment here -- still at a distance still outside
the doorway the music still playing

A few seconds pass the music keeps playing and on that --

-- WE CUT TO BLACK

150B

COURTYARD where a BANDSTAND has been set up -- a CUBAN BAND is in
the middle of a hot and heavy TUNE -- CUSTOMERS are dancing LA

TOURISM OFFICIALS are filming the event with a second-hand BandH
EYEMO CAMERA -- and Nellie’s right there in front of the
bandstand whirling like a dervish to the music She sees Manny

NELLIE
I love this song

Manny looks at her Is about to PULL HIS FUCKING HAIR OUT And yet

-- for a moment -- SOMETHING HOLDS HIM BACK from stopping her WE
PUSH IN ON NELLIE -- surrendering completely to the music Time
seems to freeze It’s just her and the song now -- like it was at

Wallach’s party years ago She gives Manny that SMILE of hers --
at once sly and blissed-out scheming and sincere the SMILE that
makes him putty in her hands -- he stays still until -- finally
SNAPPING OUT OF IT and GRABBING hold of her THIS HAS TO STOP --

MANNY NELLIE (CONTD)
Nellie We have to leave now I’m stayin I wanna stay --
MANNY
NELLIE Why are you doing this

He lets the question ring His voice has broken He seems near
tears

Nellie looks at him Taken aback Something has registered
MANNY (CONTD)
Why You know what happens if they
find us I know you know

This seems to affect Nellie She stops moving Quieter now --

NELLIE

She’s calm Lucid And then taking Manny’s face in her hands --

NELLIE (CONTD)
You know it’s the end of the road for me

She says it with total awareness As though the drug-induced haze
has lifted Was it ever even there Refusing to accept it --

MANNY NELLIE (CONTD)
No It’s NOT -- You go to Mexico without me --

MANNY
I’m not going anywhere without you
Nellie please -- we can be happy I
promise I will make you happy you’1l

He can’t hold it in any longer Nellie looks at him Seems to see
him anew The desperate lovesick boy beneath the man’s exterior
The SONG ends Silence Finally her thoughts crystallizing --

NELLIE

Manny looks at Nellie Processing

NELLIE (CONTD)
One more song and then we’ll drive
to the border well live down south

starts moving with her She bends her head back closes her eyes
once more -- and the two of them DANCE TOGETHER

Awash in sweat holding each other close -- feeling each other’s
heat tasting each other’s breath -- letting everything else go
WE LINGER here -- the Tourism Officials grinning ‘cause they’ve
hit the jackpot Manny and Nellie sharing the blur of music and
dance and waning sunlight Soon Manny closes his eyes as well
he’s living inside a DREAM his entire being overflowing with LOVE
-- and with it for at least this instant PEACE

WE CUT BACK TO the Tourism Officials -- their hand-cranked camera
pointed at our heroes WE CUT BACK TO NELLIE AND MANNY -- leaning
in their lips about to lock WE PUSH IN -- and all of a sudden --
SOUND DROPS OUT -- AND WE SEE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGE CAPTURED

BY THE TOURISM OFFICIALS’ CAMERA

NELLIE AND MANNY KISSING It’s a kiss for the ages The final rays
of sunlight refracting behind their faces the lustrous black-and-
white frame capturing the two of them like a pair of incandescent
movie stars Like a shot from one of Jack Conrad or Nellie’s
greatest silent productions it’s the PUREST KIND OF MOVIE MAGIC

And Nellie and Manny both look as blissfully happy as can be

EXT THE COUNT’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 227

DUFFEL Takes just the handbag Checks to make sure the KEYS are
still in the car for Manny -- then steps out into the street

It’s empty Dark except for a single lamp’s pool of green light on
the asphalt Nellie saunters toward the lamp then past it Starts
softly HUMMING Then doing DANCE MOVES -- as if to keep the party
going even if only in her head WE STAY HERE watching her
dance off into the night -- further and further from the
lamplight further and further away from us

before at last she disappears completely into the pitch black
INT THE COUNT’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 228

POUNDING on a door The Count opens It’s Manny

MANNY
Sorry were late -- are you ready
THE COUNT MANNY (CONTD)
Yeah I got everything I It was hard to find gas --
didn’t know where you were -- can we go
THE COUNT
Yeah lemme just fill this up KYLE
this is my roommate Kyle -- Hey
Manny nods to KYLE -- 40s in PJ’s eating cereal Closes the
door behind him as the Count fills a JUG with water from the tap --
THE COUNT MANNY
You want anything No I’m ok

Notices a stack of HEAD SHOTS the Count’s and Kyle’s And in the
corner a STASH of DISCARDED MOVIE POSTERS Manny PICKS one up

Suddenly -- THE DOOR BURSTS BACK OPEN -- and a MAN we recognize
steps in McKay’s ASSOCIATE from the Garden of Allah Manny and
the Count SPIN around The Associate RAISES a GUN --

-- and FIRES seven rounds in the span of a second KILLING both
the Count and Kyle

Manny’s on his knees spattered with their blood But somehow he’s
still alive The bullets just missed him The Associate RELOADS --
-- RE-AIMS lightning-fast about to FIRE -- when he hesitates

Manny’s crouched there in shock -- knees shaking body trembling
pants now DRIPPING with URINE He begins to PLEAD

MANNY (CONT’D)
Please Please don’t kill me I’m
sorry I’m sorry Please

The Associate looks at him Looks at this convulsing terrified
sweat-and-pee-soaked WRECK -- kneeling in a pool of his own urine
hands clutched as though in prayer helpless as an infant with no
clear idea just how he wound up here pleading beseeching

MANNY (CONTD)
Por favor Lo siento Lo siento
Por favor

He’s almost choking on his pleas The Associate stands still for a
moment Taking in the sight Processing Thinking

Then finally --

ASSOCIATE
Give me all the cash you have

Eyes widening Manny still trembling RACES to unload his pockets
-- PULLS out any and all CASH -- RUMMAGES through the Count’s and
Kyle’s pockets -- HANDS it all over The Associate thinks Then --

ASSOCIATE (CONT’D)
Now get the fuck out of here and don’t
come back

Manny NODS In disbelief Gets up -- and BOLTS out
EXT THE COUNT’S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 229
Running to it Manny sees his car is EMPTY -- no sign of Nellie --
MANNY
Nellie
No response But this time -- he doesn’t chase after her He gets

into his car -- and just speeds the hell away

We linger here for a moment Just this empty dilapidated lower-
rungs-of-LA street And the silence

And then we hear a sound we recognize -- a trumpet It plays for
a moment -- before we find ourselves --

INT NIGHT CLUB - CENTRAL AVENUE - NIGHT 230
-- inside an understated little BAR AND CLUB In the corner -- the

EMPLOYEE we saw answer the door for Sidney And on a small stage --
a 10-piece BAND

A small crowd fills the club all black We’re a long way from the
Hollywood parties we’ve seen the vibe here is of a neighborhood
spot working-class no ostentation On the stage a CONDUCTOR
speaks over the music --

CONDUCTOR
And introducing tonight -- a new addition
to the Hart Café Band -- fresh from
pictures -- Mr Sidney Palmer on the
trumpet
(applause)

Sid you want to say a few words

-- and we PAN -- to SIDNEY Suit-clad standing with the band He
looks polished Quietly confident He steps to the mike Softly --

SIDNEY

Thanks Tom I just want to say to
everyone how happy I am to be here You
all look like a lovely audience

(a beat understated

sincere)
I’m going to play you a little something I
used to play and I do hope you enjoy it

He and the band begin to play It’s a medium-tempo number -- both
bouncy and melancholy The band has a warm full sound Sidneys
trumpet harmonizing beautifully with his fellow players

WE PUSH IN ON HIM as he begins a SOLO It’s soft at first --
gentler than we’re used to from him A sweetness to the notes
But then -- a few measures in -- the sound starts to grow bigger
Bolder Starts to round out -- amplifying as it fills the entire
room And then the notes pour out like water

Sidney’s impressed us before -- but this is the most beautiful
thing we’ve heard from him yet There’s an ease to his playing
now a tenderness and a power It’s a sound full of hope and
regret and love and even joy -- rich and wide and magnificent --
and it seems effortless Sidney opens his eyes -- commands the
stage like a deity -- and plays with pure sublime emotion

EXT LOS ANGELES - DAY 239

and we find ourselves on a quiet nondescript street

A BUS pulls into frame Its doors open A few people get out
161-161AA

Among them -- a seven-year-old GIRL and her PARENTS The girl’s
dad holds her aloft on his shoulders and waves back at the bus
his back to camera as the mom -- SILVIA 40s -- smiles Then the
dad sets his daughter down and turns to face us

It’s Manny In his 40s A card appears on-screen

We see what he’s looking at the GUARD GATE to a STUDIO LOT It’s

the old KINOSCOPE PICTURES

MANNY (IN SPANISH)
This is it

He and his family approach A GUARD walks up to them

NEW GUARD MANNY (CONTD)
Passes sir No we’re just looking

Manny kneels down by his Daughter’s side points to the gate --

MANNY (IN SPANISH) (CONTD)
That’s where I came in every morning

His Daughter looks Manny turns to the Guard Smiles

MANNY (IN SPANISH) (CONTD) NEW GUARD (IN SPANISH)

Oh yeah Are you having a good trip

Manny’s Daughter nods Shy The Guard notices a car pulling in --

GUARD (IN SPANISH) MANNY (IN SPANISH)
Nice talking to you You too

-- and heads to deal with it Manny lingers Eyes the activity
beyond the gate EXECS walking and talking HURRYING from one
bungalow to the next The hustle and bustle Just like it was

DAUGHTER
I’m bored

Manny turns Then -- notices Silvia looking at him smiling

SILVIA (IN SPANISH)
-You want to stay

MANNY (IN SPANISH) SILVIA (IN SPANISH) (CONTD)
Oh -- no I was gonna walk Ill take her You join us

Manny lifts his Daughter into the air gives her a big kiss --

MANNY (IN SPANISH) (CONTD)
You behave

-- and waves bye Blows another kiss to Silvia Heads off

EXT KINOSCOPE PICTURES - DAY 240
An hour later Manny slowly walks the studio lot perimeter

OMITTED 241
EXT CITY STREET - DAY 242

Late afternoon now Manny passes an APPLIANCE STORE selling
TELEVISION SETS Next to it a PIN-UP SHOP Images of Marilyn
Monroe Then further down the block -- a MOVIE THEATER

He stops Looks at it An Art Deco entrance A fleet of
Technicolor posters beckoning He takes it in Then continues on
We continue with him He stops at the end of the block Waits at a
crosswalk Seems hesitant Behind him we can still see -- the
theater Finally -- he turns back Looks at it again

He walks back toward it Wavers in front of it Uncertain again

TICKET CLERK
You coming in

Manny’s surprised to be addressed Then -- as though he no longer
has a choice -- he heads to the booth and buys a ticket
INT MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS 243

Manny enters the darkened theater We hear a CHORUS singing

CHORUS
All I do is dream of you
The whole night through
With the dawn I still go on
Dreamin’ of you

Manny looks around Hasn’t been in a theater for some time Finds

a seat Leans back Turns his attention to the SCREEN -- a bright
lush Technicolor image CHORINES in pink outfits singing and
dancing We may recognize a few faces -- Debbie Reynolds Gene

Kelly At this point we may even know which movie it is Manny
does not

His eyes drift -- from the screen to what else is around him It’s
a fairly packed house He’s one of the older people here A mostly
young audience -- and one that seems to be enjoying itself very

much Then he hears something --

CHARACTER IN MOVIE
“The Jazz Singer” that’s what’s the
matter “The Jazz Singer”

Manny turns back to the screen Did he just hear that right

CHARACTER IN MOVIE (CONT’D)
No no this is no joke Cosmo it’s a
sensation the public’s screaming for
more talking pictures talking pictures

Manny is taken aback The movie’s about the birth of the talkies
He takes it in struck by the sheer surreal déja vu of it all as --

A MONTAGE flits by on the screen -- newspaper headlines like
“REVOLUTION IN HOLLYWOOD” and “STUDIOS CONVERT” -- and then the
movie’s CHARACTERS scrambling to shoot their first talkie

Manny sits there amazed It’s as though he’s wandered into a
screening of his own life He sees a SOUND CHIEF in a SOUND BOOTH
shaking his head A DIRECTOR growing more and more frantic An
18TH-CENTURY SET just like the one Manny worked with Nellie on He
keeps watching as the scene descends into TOTAL COMEDY -- cables
getting tangled up the director losing his sanity There seems to
be a little of Jack Conrad in Gene Kelly’s character

GENE KELLY
“IT love you I love you I love you”

and a lot of Nellie in his costar played by Jean Hagen

DICTION COACH JEAN HAGEN
(speaking like Elinor) (nasal screeching)
“Pierre you shouldn’t have “Pierre you shouldn’t have
come” come”
The characters flail around -- as the audience in Manny’s theater
LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY Manny turns watches the people around him
convulsing eating it all up -- having the time of their lives

Manny can’t believe it How can they laugh so callously He glares

-- pissed now Looks back at the screen -- furious to see events
he feels so close to be so glibly mocked Keeps watching the
images becoming even more personal now -- the scene of a MOVIE

PREMIERE where Jean Hagen’s character dolled up like an 18th-
century MARQUISE just like Nellie was butchers lines with her
nasal screech --

JEAN HAGEN (CONTD)
“My father has me betrothed to the Baron
de Landsfield and I can’t stan’ ‘im”

The SPECTATORS on-screen roar with laughter -- as do those around
Manny Tears start to well in his eyes until finally -- he
begins to CRY It’s all too much The shock of recognition
Looking into the mirror He sits there weeps -- yet keeps hearing
the laughter Finally turns again -- watches these AUDIENCE
MEMBERS watching

Their delight hits him There’s something simply inescapable about
their joy They look giddy transported -- on cloud nine

On the screen a quieter scene begins Gene Kelly and Debbie
Reynolds kissing on a front stoop in the rain Sweet symphonic
MUSIC plays Manny watches for a beat then gazes again to his
side Off his look we PAN AWAY from him -- and start taking in
those other VIEWERS’ FACES People of different ages different
backgrounds and classes all looking up with delight at the silver
screen bathed in the Technicolor-hued glow of the projector

The MUSIC swirls as our CAMERA HOPS from one SPECTATOR to another
-- a mass of humanity -- the camera picking up speed as the music
picks up volume faster and faster the violins skipping and

flitting by until they resolve into a scatted tune we might know

GENE KELLY
Doo-dloo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-dloo-doo-doo-doo

The CAMERA RISES up high as though lifted by the music taking in
the sight of this packed theater of RAPT EVERYDAY MOVIEGOERS
caught in a spell -- and then as though completing a perfect
circle it settles back down right where it started

-on Manny His still-watery eyes turning from the audience
around him and locking once again onto the screen The anger has
gone now has turned into something else Glistening now through
the residual moisture in those eyes is some strange alchemy -- of
heartbreak joy regret pride -- and sheer incredulity at the
madness of it all

We hear Gene Kelly begin to SING that familiar refrain
GENE KELLY (CONTD)
I’m singin’ in the rain
Just singin’ in the rain
What a glorious feelin’
I’m happy again
and off Manny watching now the proverbial moviegoer

WE CUT TO BLACK

THE END
