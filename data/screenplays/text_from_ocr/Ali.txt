EXT MIAMI STREET - MOVEMENT - NIGHT in the dark Coming toward us Up and down in sync to an
INSTRUMENTAL LEAD-IN from somewhere A slip of light A
glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood
staring at us in and out of the dark as

INT THE STAGE HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - EMPTY FRAME - NIGHT

A man walks into the shot grabs a microphone slips out of
his jacket and looks at us He wants to tell us something
Hes in a lavender light This is SAM COOKE What he calls
outa throaty mixture of gospel soul and sexis Let me
hear it And WOMEN SHRIEK He says Yeah They answer
shrieking Oh yeah

EXT MIAMI STREET - HOODED MANS FACE - NIGHT

passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded
buildings He is CASSIUS CLAY He runs in construction

husk of an abandoned car a pastel storefront Were in
Overtown Miamis inner-city black neighborhood

INT THE STAGE HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB (MIAMI) - SAM COOKE

SAM COOKES AUDIENCE (0S)
Oh yeah

Cassius runs toward us Off to the side in the black-
mirrored water of Biscayne Bay leaden clouds in a black

And now Sam Cooke SINGS because you make me wanna
mooove and breaks into the first verse of Feel It
But we see Cassius eyes are FOCUSED CONCENTRATED
ELSEWHERE To where is this man running Why is his
expression so distant A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from
behind He looks over at

WIDE FROM THE FRONT CASSIUS A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR

thats slowed clocking the suspicious running black man
The driver starts to pull over to hassle Cassius Then
the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call He taps the
drivers shoulder They take off the driver laughing
Cassius looks after the white cops He is neither relieved
nor angry Hes dismissive And instead he sees
something else

INT A BOARD ROOM - GORDON DAVIDSON - DAY

and six other patrician white business-people of Louisville
in their green baize and wood-paneled Luxo boardroom They
speak soundlessly and patronizingly to Cassius Clay Sr
seated at the foot of the table It relates to the stack of
contracts in front of him He is in a suit and tie his

hair and moustache are dapper His ties a little loud He
has his hands folded deferentially in front of him

fully authorized to pay or disperse
such sums from the income or
principal as may be required
(beat)
Do you understand so far Mr Clay

CASSIUS CLAY SR
Uh yes I do
We get the impression that if he doesnt understand what
hes being told hes faking it He is conforming
delivering socially mandated deference

FRONTAL CASSIUS SR

and BEYOND HIM seated against the wall is Cassius Jr in
sport jacket and tie Right now he looks to his left and to
the right and only then do we notice the entire wall hes
against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs
this Louisville Sponsoring Group owns as well He is one
among their sporting possessions He doesnt like it He
looks at the back of his father listening

LSG BOARD MEMBER

VERY CLOSE climbs into the crush with other contenders
Victorious Liston being escorted out passes very close to
him on purpose to say

SONNY LISTON

To Cassius boxing is dangerous athletics but Listons
malevolence is straight from the street

overcome someday I tell you you
came to the wrong place

MALCOLM X is at the podium Ceiling fans We could be in
Tripoli
MALCOLM X (CONTD)
Cause your times will never get
better until yo make them better
And any of you who think you came
here to hear us tell you to turn
the other cheek to the brutality of
the white man and the established
system of injustice in this country
to beg for your place at their
lunch counter I say again You
came to the wrong place

And Cassius is there in a black shirt standing in the back
Malcolm X sees him nodsthe casualness attests their
familiarity is close and extensive

MALCOLM X (CONTD)

Cause we dont teach you to turn
the other cheek We dont teach
you to turn the other cheek in the
South We dont teach you to turn
the other cheek in the North The
Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
you instead to obey the law To
carry yourselves in a respectable
way And a proud Afro-American way
But at the same timewe teach

Dundee turns away to tear two strips of tape while Cassius
and Malcolm face into a corner Sarria throws a towel over
Cassius shoulders Arms bent head down a true believer
he silently stands in prayer bowing to the east with
Malcolm During this Dundee starts collecting his cut gear
on table

MALCOLM X

Its a crusade in modern times
And television is beaming if off
Telstar to the whole world So
Allah has brought this about for a
reason

(time to leave)
Salaam alaikum my brother

And as he goes leaving us not Cassius incomplete Cassius
returns to Dundee who ties gloves and puts tape over the
knot The Inspector signs that too

INT A CORRIDOR CASSIUS - NIGHT

A door slams open Cassius comes along the hallway his
entourage surrounding him Three large middle-aged white

officials accompany him too His face is set in stone
White towels are draped over his head onto his shoulders
Bundini chirps in his ear Dundee like a plumber carrying
the tools of his tradea bucket his swabs and Vaseline
And they seem distant to Cassius They reach the end of the
corridor and against the wall stand three or four older bad
cigar guys A curtainthe sounds from the arena drift
into the hallway Cassius is on his toes now dancing
dancing And as if being drawn by a force we cant see he
just goeshis entourage as if holding on carried along
by him

INT THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT

He comes into the hallthere are shouts some scattered
applause some booing growing and the sound moves through
the arenathe sounds of expectations ridicule potential

violence But past the faces and the press whats arrested
Cassius attention and makes him oblivious in his solitude
to all else is the bright 20-by-20-foot place he wants to be
most in all the world the ring

INT THE RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT

is struck by the brilliance Illuminated ready to go
dancingwarming up Counter to an expectation of anxiety
Cassius cant wait to get this on Other sounds
happenirrelevant to himand now the distant sound of
Liston coming into the ringhis bulked-up presence the
roar he inspires somewhere over there And all of a sudden
Cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death
Cassius rocks left and right like a tough kid on a corner
ready to rumble The hysteria act is gone so is the
boasting Instead there is only Cassius stare The
effect is enigmatic what is going on here A Referee

like a distant bird says something we dont hear

In the corner his feet float waiting Theres the BELL
for ROUND ONE

INT RING - ROUND ONE - WIDE
It starts
LISTON

right away throws a left that misses and attacks Cassius
throwing seven more that Cassius with extreme awkward
surprise

slides

caution evades

He is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to
feel Nevertheless he does his job measure Listons
range and speed Then a body shot catches him above the
heart Cassius feels the real power of Liston It could
stop your hearts beating He survives Then

CASSIUS

throws his long left jab It keeps Liston at a set distance
He has Listons range now and he dances away from Listons
charges Then halfway through the round Cassius eyes

have hunted out an opportunity and he throws his first
combination with a few hard shots that to Listons

rock Listons head back And then Cassius easily evades
LISTONS

furious big misses to the left and right

CASSIUS

keeps tagging Liston with his long left And now
infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from
Listons big misses provoking even wilder and more
inaccurate Liston assaults (Were aware that any Liston
shot could knock out Cassius if it connected) Then Cassius
soaks up a couple of body shots most flicks his jab

dances clinches circles awayUNTIL
AT THE END OF THE ROUND

Cassius launches a second combination slams a couple of big
lefts Listons way that rock his head back two times
Listons so furious he flips charging Cassius who hits
and ducks at the same time The BELL RINGS THREE TIMES
before they stop

CLAYS CORNER - CASSIUS

breathes hard Dundee works Cassius says something we
cant hear

an open mouthto the press ridiculing their accusation he
was all talk Its clear he controlled Round One to
everyones surprise

We see press with typewriters ribbon microphones note
pads massive TV cameras hang on platforms over two of the
corners Its a desultory lower-key version of Round One
And

BIRDS NEST TV CAMERA MEDIA

Coverage segues to Liston who throws and misses a few
Cassius tags him with a few rights

THE BELL CASSIUS

literally ambles into the corner

SONNYS CORNER HIS TWO TRAINERS

Listons getting a lot of strident advice THE BELL

INT RING ROUND THREE
LISTONS LEFT

comes in like a freight train Cassius merely leans away to
avoid Liston circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A
CUT UNDER SONNYS LEFT EYE Then he splits out of there

ANNOUNCER
(at ringside on radio)
Hes opened a cut on Liston
Listons never been cut

And Cassius seizing opportunity hits Liston with more
combinations If Cassius won Round One probably but not
certainly won Round Two he now demonstrates he OWNS Round
Three Its a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork
flicked jabs that confuse and then hard-hitting
combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston No
one told Sonny that Cassius could hit And at 210 pounds
he hits HARD Liston angered panicked knows hes losing
and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends
Round Three

INT CLAYS CORNER - CLAY

INT RING - ROUND FIVE - LISTON

rushes Clay He knows this is his chance Cassius tries to
tie Liston up by holding onto the back of his neck but

Liston pounds left and right hooks If anybody wondered if
Clay could take punishment this answers that WHAM-WHAM-
WHAM-WHAM-WHAMfive huge hooks

Liston is desperate to end it while Cassius is in trouble
Haymaker after haymaker some connect others are blocked
but knock Clay sideways Clay still blind keeps backing

cant wait to get out He shuffles He circles He fires
combinations In the early rounds provoked by Cassius
Listons anger caused him to abandon his fight plan Now

and runs off We catch a glimpse on the periphery of Joseph
13X Seven or eight reporters black and white and still
photographers and Bingham half with Cassius half
photographer in privileged position

A REPORTER

CASSIUS

ancestors I dont want to be
called after that slave name no

Im a member of the Nation of Islam
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my
spiritual guide Malcolm X is my
mentor

This is hard news

REPORTERS
(all at once)
You a card-carrying member Arent
Black Muslims a hate group

CASSIUS
(droll)
Card-carrying Dont need no
card You got a Christian card
750 million people believe in Islam
Im one of them

ANOTHER REPORTER (0S)
Minister Malcolmwhat about the
reports of a split between you and
Elijah Muhammad

JOSEPH 13X we read his face listening to Malcolm

MALCOLM X
This is the champs time And Im
here as a friend to celebrate his
victory So I got nothing you want

CASSIUS
Im going to be a peoples champion
But I dont have to be the way you
want me to be Im gonna be what I
want And Im free to think any
way I want

And as he goes on the crowd knows neither Cassius nor
Malcolm will ever turn their backs on them

EXT THE HOTEL THERESA - MALCOLM - NIGHT

enters into the street with his Bodyguard and looks up to a
top-floor window in which he sees a light is still on at 4

INT THE HOTEL THERESA CASSIUS ROOM - CASSIUS - BEFORE
DAWN

asleep with the television on Theres a knock on the door
Barely awake he gets up to answer it Its Malcolm Still
in his familiar hat and overcoat He hasnt slept

MALCOLM X
I was leaving saw the light
onhow come youre up
CASSIUS

(mumbles half-asleep)
-watchin a show on
termitesthey knockin down this
house here

He goes back to lay on the bed Malcolm looks out the
windowthe wet streets at night

MALCOLM X

CASSIUS
When we leaving

MALCOLM X
Next Thursday

Malcolms distracted He fingers his glasses
CASSIUS
(sees)
What is it

MALCOLM X
You ever been so angryhave you

ever been so angry that youd explode

CASSIUS
(after a beat)
Tore out a picture of Emmett Till
when I was little Couldnt take

my eyes to itcouldnt look at it

Barb-wire around his neck to a 75-
pound cotton-gin fan Took out his
eye The cruelty to itI
couldnt look at itcouldnt
throw it away

MALCOLM X
What else

CASSIUS
I thought What I do wrong to be
so low that people could do that to
people like me It made me feel
ashamed And that makes no sense
But thats what it was

MALCOLM X

when I heard about the four
girls bombed in the 16th Street
Church in Birmingham
(beat)
The prohibitions of the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad prevented me from
speaking my voice in action
Because Birmingham was part of the
civil rights movement begging for
a place at the white mans table
But dead childrenare dead
children So the anger I felt I
had to contain I locked that down
So tight my muscles seized I lost
control over the right side of my
body Leg didnt workright arm
didnt work Im having a stroke
I thought I had to hold it in
cause I wanted all I wanted was

to BREAK SOMETHING Break a
partany part of this system
Because you are so provoked as a
human being In your spirit In
your heart At the death of
children But I COULD DOnothing

Cassius is quiet

MALCOLM X (CONTD)

(putting his glasses

back on)
Everyone knows Now Im
advocating more direct political
action involvement with the
international struggle So
Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as
a Minister in the Nation of Islam
for 90 days

CASSIUS
You can fix that

MALCOLM X
I dont know I will try when we
get back Until then I will live
each day as if I am already dead

That statement surprises Cassius but he says nothing
Malcolm X stands by the window and watches the day begin in
Harlem
INT ELIJAH MUHAMMADS HOUSE CHICAGO 1964 - JOSEPH 13X -
DAY

approaches Cassius in a suit and tie and beckons him into a
living room in which sits Elijah Muhammad on a plastic-
covered white sofa Cassius is at his most deferential
awed at being in this mans presence Elijahs power is the
inverse of his size Hes short and delicate-featured He
motions for Cassius to sit beside him Joseph 13X sits
across the room with two men

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
Only after long service and high
merit in the spiritual and physical
rebirth of Afro-American peopleis
one granted an original name But
you are special A world champion
So there is a gift I wish to give
you From this day forward you
will be known as Muhammad
Aliwhich means one worthy of
praise and Ali means most high

CASSIUS
(a beat sounding it)
Muhammad Ali
(humble)
Worthy of praise

Thank you

And hes genuinely moved As Elijah Muhammad puts his small
hands in Muhammad Alis handsgiving him his blessings

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
(cautioning)
Be very careful what you sayyour
words reflect on the nation of
Islam now

CASSIUS
Yes sir

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

(after a beat)
Up until now I have entrusted your
spiritual development to Brother
Malcolm

(beat)
I do not feel this is a wise course
anymore

Extremely emotional about Malcolm tears come to Elijah
Muhammads eyes Joseph 13X observes in the background
Cassius is taken by surprise at The Messengers display

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONTD)
Malcolm has gone off into the
secular world and does not measure
his words I have decided to give
you as your guide my very own son
Herbert Muhammad

And he looks across the rooma roly-poly man wearing a bow
tieHERBERT MUHAMMAD He has a habit of nervously
straightening his shirt A seemingly mild pleasant man he
is without self-definition Below this avuncular surface

he defines himself by quietly desiring and acquiring what is
others

ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONTD)
Herbert will supervise all of your
spiritual and material needs

CASSIUS
(not a thought)
This is a great honor Messenger

Elijah gives a subtle look and Herbert retreats to where he
came from sitting back on the couch by Joseph 13x

jolts Frazier SIDEWAYS Frazier throws another hook that
misses Foreman hits him with a combination of right and
three leftstwo hooks and an uppercut that LIFTS FRAZIER

even if I die here If it kill
me no matter whatI gotta win

Concentration has taken him into the athletes zone the
state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self-
knowledge And he knows the transaction what they give
him with their adoration which he converts to power is in
exchange for what he means to them And what he means to
them is specific he represents them in defying power and
vanquishing what oppresses He validates the existence of
expectation that struggle is possibleGeorge Foreman
mute and unknowingly represents disinterested power Ali
doesnt accept his obligation he embraces it It is his
purpose revealed And he will never waver from it
