SPECIAL EFFECT - SKY FULL OF STARS

The planet Mars shows just above the spires and roof-
tops of a city on the horizon

VOICE
(Continuing)
that human affairs were being
watched keenly and closely by
intelligences greater than mans

Mars is picked out of the sky and brought to the screen
as if by some enormous telescope with an infinite field
It becomes a small ball Enlarges to a pallid disk
Comes to moon size
VOICE
No one gave a thought to the older
worlds as a source of human danger
Yet across the gulf of space on the
planet Mars

Now Mars has grown big and ruddy-colored Mysterious
canals revealed Vegetation patches shadowy One thin
polar cap shimmering

VOICE
Intellects vast and cool and unsym-
pathetic regarded our earth with envious
eyes slowly and surely drawing their
plans against us

SPECIAL EFFECT - OUR WORLD - MOVING SHOT

seen in space with its halo of atmosphere beautiful

VOICE
Few voices were ever raised in
warning as with infinite compla-
cency men went to and fro over
this globe busy about their
affairs

(Over f and g)
It did not occur to mankind that
a swift fate might be hanging over

us Or that from the blackness of
outer space we were being scrutinized

SPECIAL EFFECT - MARS

The planet as we saw it before CAMERA MOVES IN until
the planet is huge on the screen Strange and baleful

VOICE
Mars is more than one hundred and
forty million miles from the sun and
for centuries it has been in the last
stages of exhaustion Its rocks have
absorbed almost all oxygen from its
air turning them red

SPECIAL EFFECT - MARTIAN LANDSCAPE

A geometric pattern of great canals joins in the far
distance to center on a Martian metropolis High
atop a tower a light pulsates rhythmically

VOICE
Most of its water has gone At
night temperatures drop to more
than one hundred and twenty degrees
below zero even at the equator

SERIES OF DISSOLVES - SPECIAL EFFECT (MOVING SHOTS)

CAMERA FLOATS through the blackness of space pick-
ing up each succeeding spectacle

a Our solar system as seen from Mars The sun
golden Mercury ruddy and hot Venus beau-
tiful bright Saturn with its tinted rings
and moons Jupiter big cloudy with four
moons Uranus and Neptune both greenish-
yellow toxic And Pluto far away

VOICE
The inhabitants of this dying planet looked
across space with instruments and intelli-
gences of which we have scarcely dreamed

CAMERA MOVES IN on Pluto dim in outer space

VOICE (Contd)
searching for another World to which they
could migrate They could not go to Pluto
outermost of all the planets and so cold
that its atmosphere lies frozen on its
surface

CAMERA PICKS UP Neptune and Uranus clouded giants
with poison-colored atmospheres

VOICE (Contd)
They couldnt go to Neptune or Uranus - twin
worlds in eternal night and perpetual cold
Each surrounded by an unbreathable atmosphere
full of methane gas and ammonia vapor The
Martians considered Saturn

b Saturnian landscape Midnight-blue space-sky
crossed by merging rings of cosmic dust
Bright-edged full of color and marvelous to
see

VOICE
An attractive world with its many
moons and beautiful rings of cosmic
dust But its temperature is close
to two hundred and seventy degrees
below zero and ice lies fifteen
thousand miles deep on its surface
Their nearest world was giant Jupiter

Effect Pan Shot - Landscape of Jupiter

An incredible world Cliffs flaming at

the tops and spilling into fuming lakes
Everywhere the same process repeating itself

VOICE
Where there are titanic cliffs of lava
and ice with hydrogen flaming at the tops
Where the atmospheric pressure is terrible -
thousands of pounds to the square inch
On Mars it is only four pounds They
couldnt go there Nor to Venus which
has no oxygen and no water Nor could they
go to Mercury nearest planet to the sun

d Effect - Mercurian Landscape A glaring
sun is enormous in a dark sky stars visible
near it The land is heat-hazed waterless
fissured Volcanic cones and lava pools

VOICE
It has no air And the temperature at its
equator is that of molten lead Of all the
worlds that the intelligences on Mars
could see and study

e North American continent seen from a
great height showing clouds forests
glistening lakes and rivers

He gestures her to silence moves toward the wall
and the opening he had made She peers fearfully
out through the broken patio door

SYLVIA

Theyve pushed up earth or something

He snatches an axe from the woodbox by the fireplace
jabbing between fallen ceiling beams Sylvia looks
fearfully around

ments falling across the tubing and the eye pinning
it to the floor

hacking with the axe He cuts the lens clear The
rest of the mechanism is withdrawn fast snaking up

containing the eye)
This is something tangible to

SHOOTING past Clayton She comes into SCENE behind
him pulling on a loose beam to give him room using
a piece of cloth to protect her hands Behind her
is a door leading to the den It is broken sprung
from its hinges

CAMERA MOVES IN past Clayton as out of the dark cavity
behind Sylvia comes a hand that is more than a hand
on an arm that is thin lean with degenerate muscu-
lature Thick veins cross it pulsating Back of it
is a dim form The hand-shape has three fingerlike
suckers They fasten on Sylvias shoulder spreading
huge Her eyes and mouth open in horror She tries
to scream but her vocal cords are paralyzed shocked
She is drawn back drops the loose beam Then she
forces a SOUND between her lips Clayton hears and
leaps to help her sending the beam of his flash-
light at the figure behind her

FLASH - CLOSE SHOT - MARTIAN

itself crossed by protruding veins which pulsate
Dominant is a single multi-lensed eye with colored
pupils The Martian is staggered by the light He
lifts his strange suckered hands to ward it off

Clayton turns with Sylvia to escape The Martian
lunges after them Clayton turns the flashlight on
the figure again It stops staggered Clayton
flings the axe and the Martian reels back as the axe
hits An unhuman SCREAMING sounds as it disappears
back into the cavity This continues overscene as
Clayton swings Sylvia to the opening in the ceiling

then follows

EXT STREET and CHURCH - CROWD (MOVING SHOT)

Some singing Some in silent prayer Some in silent
ecstasy The young husband hugging his kids An old
woman all alone singing softly with the others eyes
turned to heaven They start to move toward the
church CAMERA PICKS UP IN CLOSE SHOT Clayton and
Sylvia She is radiant He smiles holding her gaze
as he takes off his glasses folds them and puts them
in his pocket bending to her She takes his arm
smiling up at him They move after the crowd She
starts to sing as they go

SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT STREET and CITY BEYOND

CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN into the street as the crowd
moves toward the church Almost unconsciously people
have formed a lane along which the small figures of
Clayton and Sylvia walk CAMERA PANS UP the facade

of the church to the belfry where bells begin to ring
out joining the chorus of SOUND from the VOICES and
other belfrys CAMERA PANS ACROSS burned smoking
buildings to an untouched sector of the city - CROSSING
other belfrys with their ringing BELLS A dawn sun is
rising beyond rooftops as the SINGING VOICES end in a
great AMEN

FADE OUT

THE END
