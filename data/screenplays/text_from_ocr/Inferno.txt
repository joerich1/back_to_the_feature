EXT SIXTH AVENUE DAY

Humanity teems on Sixth Avenue at rush hour Its one of those
long lens shots the kind that makes youre glad youre not
crammed onto that same sidewalk with the sweaty hordes

A Town Car pulls over in the bumper-to-bumper traffic and an
elegant woman in her mid-forties gets out carrying a leather
satchel DR ELIZABETH SINSKEY is late

The DRIVER lowers the window wait I can get you there

DR SINSKEY
Too crowded I11 do better on foot

She hurries away into the thick of the crowd
CUT TO
EXT 68TH AND PARK AVENUE DAY
Its much quieter at 68th and Park Dr Sinskey stands at the
door of a three story neoclassical building on the corner Its
a magnificent place the type that would have been home to an oil
baron in the early 1900s
Sinskey waits one hand on the ornate handle of the large doors
looking up into a video camera She forces a smile for whoevers
watching
COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS
New York City
two years ago
The door BUZZES and Dr Sinskey pulls it open
INT COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS - LOBBY DAY
Dr Sinskey approaches a RECEPTIONIST at a desk in the lobby
DR SINSKEY
Dr Elizabeth Sinskey of the World
Health Organization I have an
appointment with Dr Bertram Zobrist
INT CFR - CONFERENCE ROOM DAY
Dr Sinskey is ushered into a conference room The wooden blinds
are drawn just a few slanted rays of light piercing the air of

the grand panelled room

A large video screen sits at the end of a mahogany conference
table and a tall silhouetted figure stands in front of it
2 9-20-13

Dr Sinskey blinks her eyes adjusting The figure speaks --
BERTRAM ZOBRIST has a precise but undefinable accent Alsatian
maybe

ZOBRIST
Dr Sinskey I was at your
presentation this morning at the
UN Very impressive

DR SINSKEY
Thank you Doctor

She takes off her coat puts it over a chair and has a seat at
the conference table

DR SINSKEY (contd)
To what do I owe the pleasure of
meeting you

He hits a button on a laptop and»an image pops up on the screen --
a painting depicting a vast sea of humanity throngs of sickly
people climbing over one another in a dense tangle of bodies

DR SINSKEY (contd)
Yes I was just on Sixth Avenue

ZOBRIST
(ignoring her joke)
Dores grim interpretation of Dantes
vision of hell I hope it looks
comfortable to you Because thats
where were headed

DR SINSKEY
Im sorry may I ask what this is
about

ZOBRIST
There is only one global health issue
Doctor Overpopulation Every other
ill that ails the planet is a symptom
of that disease And your
organization has become part of the
problem

DR SINSKEY
Dr Zobrist I agreed to meet you
out of deference to your reputation
and your accomplishments in germ-
line manipulation I did not agree
to be lectured
3 9-20-13

ZOBRIST
Actually I was hoping for
enlightenment

He picks up a sheet of paper from the table and tears it in half
He puts the two pieces on top of each other and tears them again
He places the stack of four smaller pieces back on the table

ZOBRIST (contd)
The original sheet of paper was one
tenth of a millimeter thick After
two tears its four tenths of a
millimeter If I were to repeat the

process -- say fifty times -- do
you know how tall the stack would
be

DR SINSKEY
One-tenth of a millimeter times two
to the fiftieth power Its called
geometric progression And Im
calling it a day

She puts her phone in her bag closes it and starts to stand

ZOBRIST
To the sun After only fifty
doublings the stack of paper would
reach to the sun

In spite of her irritation with him that slows her down

He hits another button and the image changes to a graph A
straight line moves across the bottom of the frame nearly all
the way from left to right But just before it reaches the right
side the line turns sharply upward in a nearly straight line

ZOBRIST (contd)
It took the earths population a
hundred thousand years to reach a
billion people Then just a hundred
years to reach two billion And
only fifty years to double again to
four billion people in 1970 Were
nearly at eight billion now If you
and I live another forty years we
will see the worlds population
quadruple in our lifetime Thirty-
two billion people By any biological
gauge our species has exceeded
sustainable numbers
4 9-20-13

DR SINSKEY
The WHO takes overpopulation quite
seriously We spend tens of millions
on condom distribution every-

ZOBRIST
Youre swinging a fly swatter at an
incoming asteroid

DR SINSKEY
What exactly is it you would like us
to do Doctor

ZOBRIST
I want the WHO to take bold action
in the face of imminent human
extinction Or I will take such
action myself

She looks at him He cant be saying what she thinks hes saying

DR SINSKEY
You should choose your words more
carefully Some might interpret
that as a terrorist threat

ZOBRIST
The darkest places in hell are
reserved for those who maintain their
neutrality in times of moral crisis

DR SINSKEY
I see And what is your vision of a
sustainable future What is the
ideal population of the earth

ZOBRIST
Humankinds best chance of long-term
survival occurs with a global
population of around four billion

DR SINSKEY
Its a little late for that

He takesa step forward and now hes fully lit from above

ZOBRIST
Is it

INT DREAM SPACE NIGHT

In the dark of a dream surreal images swim before us Were
moving across a post-apocalyptic landscape under fiery skies

Writhing pairs of legs protrude upside down from the earth poor
souls whove been buried headfirst to the waist On each of the
pale thighs the letter R smeared in mud At least we hope
its mud The CRIES OF HUMAN SUFFERING can be heard all around
echoing in our ears

We keep moving toward the bank of a river up ahead its churning
waters running red with blood

A VEILED WOMAN stands on the far side of the river her arms
outstretched beckoning to us

We move closer to her across the surface of the river closer
and closer still and we can hear her barely as she tells us
something important

VEILED WOMAN
Seek and find

Hands rise up into frame our hands but as they touch the veil
to raise it the image of the woman starts to glow white hot the
veil catches on fire --

VEILED WOMAN (contd)
Seek and find

-- and she EXPLODES in a burst of white light Out of the
blinding burning light a single word swims out a title filling
nearly the entire screen
INFERNO
CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT
ROBERT LANGDONs eyes open

He stares up at ceiling tiles And fluorescent light shining
through translucent panels He speaks his voice a CROAK

LANGDON
Please dont go

He blinks Wait what

Hes disoriented doesnt know why he just said that
6 9-20-13

He tries to move feels a sharp pain in his right arm He turns
his head and sees an IV tugging at the skin of his forearm

His eyes widen his pulse quickens and the soft BEEPING sounds
weve been hearing in the background keep pace getting faster

He struggles to sit up can only manage to move a little bit up
on the pillow Hes in a hospital room Hes alone its night
He winces reaches up with his free hand and touches the back of
his head

He rubs a small matted area there where a dozen stitches are
sewn into his scalp He pulls his hand back and looks at his
fingertips They have flecks of dried blood on them

Hes confused and frightened

A MAN IN SCRUBS hurries into the room Fiftyish bearded He
goes straight to the monitors and checks them

LANGDON (contd)
Did I have an accident

The Man looks at him and smiles He holds up a finger hang on a
second and hurries out of the room

Langdon looks around On a table nearby he sees his clothes in
a plastic bag Theyre covered in blood His jacket is over the
back of the chair

He looks to the window Its dark out so he sees only his own
reflection pale and weary attached to tubes and wires surrounded
by medical equipment

VOICES approach in the hall and the Man in Scrubs reappears
accompanied by a woman DR SIENNA BROOKS is in her early
thirties blue scrubs and blond hair held back in a ponytail
She goes to Langdon and speaks in lightly accented English

SIENNA
Im Dr Sienna Brooks Dr Marconi
doesnt speak much English and he
asked me to talk with you

She shines a penlight in his eyes
SIENNA (contd)
Do you know what day of the week it

is Mr Langdon

Langdon thinks hard Too hard for such a simple question

7 9-20-13

LANGDON
Saturday

SIENNA
Close Whats the last thing you
remember

LANGDON
Walking across campus A lecture
series

He rubs his head in pain the spot behind his right ear

LANGDON (contd)
Im sorry I -- dont know whats
going on Did I fall

SIENNA
Well get to that Is there someone
we should call for you

LANGDON
No Nobody

He glances at his left wrist as) if to check the time but his

arm is bare

He rubs it confused He looks back up at Sienna

LANGDON (contd)
Was I with -- a woman

SIENNA
No You were discovered alone on
the street three hours ago with a
head wound When you were brought
to our emergency room you were
mumbling something over and over

She glances at the Man in Scrubs who holds up a digital recorder
and presses a button A recording begins to play and Langdons
groggy voice is recognizable

LANGDON (0S)
Ve sorry Ve sorry

SIENNA
Do you have any idea why youd be
saying this Are you sorry about
something

LANGDON
Did I cause a car accident Did I
hurt someone
8 9-20-13

He struggles sits up halfway His heart monitor races the
PINGING sound grows rapid and fills the room

LANGDON (contd)
My thoughts are -- cant hold on to
them

Sienna nods to the Man in Scrubs who shuts off the recorder
She puts a hand on Langdons shoulder to calm him

SIENNA
Anxiety is common with brain injuries
You need to keep your pulse rate
down No movement no excitement
Ive given you a sedative just lie
still and rest Your memory will
come back slowly

She nods again to the Man in Scrubs who leaves the room
SIENNA (contd)
If you need anything press the button
on your bedside

She turns out the light and leaves leaving Langdon alone again

He lies there for a minute his respiration returning to normal
Nearly calm he turns and looks to the window again

With the lights out in the room his own reflection has
disappeared replaced by an illuminated skyline in the distance

Amid a contour of spires and domes a single regal facade dominates
the view The building is an imposing stone fortress with a
notched parapet and a three hundred foot tower that swells at the
top bulging into a massive battlement

Langdon sits bolt upright in bed his monitors go crazy again
and he cries out in a strong solid voice

LANGDON
Im in FLORENCE

CUT TO
EXT HOSPITAL BUILDING NIGHT
In the shadow of the building Langdon saw out his window on the
Via Torregalli a BMW motorcycle glides to a halt across the

street

VAYENTHA a powerfully built woman in her mid-twenties climbs
off the bike
9 9-20-13

She has a close-cropped haircut parts of it dyed and wears
leathers The bottom edge of a tatt sleeve crawls down her arm
and out over the back of her right hand

Vayentha waits for a sedan to pass on the rain-slicked street and
looks both ways Convinced shes alone she opens a compartment
on the side of the bike and pulls something out

Its a 9 mm handgun She screws a thin tube onto the end of it
tucks it into her belt pulls her jacket around it and heads
into the building

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

In Langdons hospital room the monitors are PINGING like mad
Sienna races into the room flicks on the lights and finds Langdon
sitting straight up on the bed jamming his finger into the call
button over and over again

SIENNA
Are you okay

LANGDON
What am I doing in Italy

SIENNA
Good Youre remembering

LANGDON
No I recognize the Palazzo Vecchio

SIENNA
Mr Langdon theres no need to worry
Youre suffering from mild retrograde
amnesia but Dr Marconi confirmed
that your brain function suffered no
permanent damage

The Man in Scrubs rushes in as well having heard the call button
He checks the monitors turns the sound off on one or two of them
and he and Sienna confer in rapid Italian

Langdon rubs his head

LANGDON
What day is it

SIENNA
Monday March 18th Early morning
10 9-20-13

LANGDON
Monday Ive lost forty-eight hours

He winces and reaches up to his head feels the wound there again

LANGDON (contd)
What kind of accident was I in

From the wall the intercom system CRACKLES and a VOICE speaks in
rapid Italian Dr Marconi goes to it and replies then exchanges
more words in Italian with Sienna

Sienna looks at Langdon concerned

SIENNA
That was the front desk Someone is
here to see you

LANGDON
Thank God Who is»it

STENNA
I dont know But this is the ICU
we dont allow visitors at five in
the morning

LANGDON
I want to see whoever it is They
must know whats going on

Sienna speaks in rapid Italian to Dr Marconi who nods and goes
to the doorway

SIENNA
Before you see anyone you have a
right to hear all the facts of your
case Until now I havent wanted
to upset you

LANGDON
Too late What happened

SIENNA
Your head wound was not caused by an
accident It was caused by a gunshot

He looks at her in disbelief

SIENNA (contd)
A bullet grazed the top of your skull
and most likely gave you a concussion
(MORE )
11 9-20-13

SIENNA (contd)
An inch lower and you would not have
survived It took twelve stitches
to close the wound

LANGDON
Someone shot me

From the hallway they hear VOICES rising in argument Whoever
is here to see Langdon is not interested in waiting

Langdon leans to look out into the hallway At the far end he
sees a door burst open and Vayentha the woman from the
motorcycle steps out of the stairwell

She turns and strides down the hallway toward Langdons room

Dr Marconi takes a step forward in the doorway holding up a
hand and BARKING at her to stop in Italian

Without breaking stride Vayentha opens her jacket pulls the
handgun from her belt --

-- AND SHOOTS MARCONI IN THE CHEST

There is a staccato HISS as the shot rips from the barrel of the
gun Dr Marconi staggers backward into the room BANGS off the
door frame and falls to the floor clutching his chest

Blood flows between his fingers

Langdon looks up in horror as Vayentha keeps moving toward the
door of the room now just ten feet away --

-- she raises the gun --

-- five feet away --

-- she points it at Langdons head --

-- he flinches mother of mercy is this the end of Robert --

-- BANG

It wasnt a gunshot it was the hospital room door SLAMMING shut
Sienna who was behind it flips the deadbolt lock Langdon watches
in frozen horror as she drops to the ground distraught calling
out in Italian to Dr Marconi but he is gone dead from a bullet
wound to the chest and now theres a POUNDING on the hospital

door and its just a few moments before Vayentha figures a way
to come through and into the room
12 9-20-13

Sienna and Langdon start moving at the same time

Sienna jumps to her feet as Langdon swings his legs out of the
hospital bed he doesnt know where hes going but hes going
someplace this is a very very bad hospital and as he gets to
his feet he GROANS in pain

He looks down sees that hes torn the IV out of his vein and the
broken needle is dangling there blood now flowing down his
forearm

In the hallway two more bullets SLAM into the locked door
SPLINTERING the wood They only have seconds

Sienna throws open the door to the bathroom --

SIENNA
This way

-- and Langdon drags himself across the room staggering from the
effect of the drugs headed for the bathroom Sienna grabs
Langdons jacket off the back of the chair she races into the
bathroom just behind him --

INT HOSPITAL - BATHROOM NIGHT

-- and she SLAMS and locks that door too lLangdons eyes fix on
the door lock for a moment something about it bothers him but
from the other room they can hear a LOUD SMASH as the door to the
hospital room gives way and Vayentha closes in on them

Sienna grabs a pair of scrub pants from a shelf in the bathroom
and throws them to Langdon

SIENNA
Put these on Move

Langdon fights his way into the scrub pants as Sienna goes to
another door on the opposite side of the bathroom

INT RECOVERY ROOM NIGHT

The door to a recovery room BANGS open and Sienna leads Langdon

out of the bathroom fast supporting him by one arm as he staggers
through the room and into the hospital hallway

INT STAIRCASE NIGHT

In the hospital staircase Langdon clings to the rail half-

running half-falling down the stairs as fast as his bare feet
and diminished state will allow
13 9-20-13

His blood-soaked hand drags an angry red smear down the railing
as he goes

Sienna ahead of him throws open a door to the street at the
bottom of the stairs Langdon staggers toward it and we go

INTO LANGDONS POINT OF VIEW

where the corners of the image are blurry and fading as the head
wound the sedatives and the sudden movement take their toll

Our point of view bobs toward the light coming from the street --
EXT HOSPITAL NIGHT

-- and out into the street blackness now coming in flashes We
move down the street then its black then we see Siennas face
as she holds us up encouraging us to run faster then black
then we see a cab at the corner up ahead then black we look
back over our shoulder and see Vayentha coming out of the hospital
twenty yards behind us --

-- black --

-- the back door of the cab flies open and we fall half onto the
seat and half onto the floor of the cab the door SLAMS behind
us and SHOUTING between Sienna and the Cabbie in Italian

ON THE STREET

and out of Langdons point of view we see the side view mirror
of the car EXPLODE in a shower of glass and metal

The CABBIE shouts in anger and surprise but he punches the gas
and the car SQUEALS away from the corner leaving Vayentha behind

INT CAB NIGHT

In the back of the cab Langdon is on the floor heavy-lidded
fighting for consciousness

He looks down at his arm sees Siennas fingers probing the broken
needle in his forearm getting a grip on it

SIENNA
This will hurt

She YANKS the broken IV out of his arm Langdon passes out

CUT TO
14 9-20-13

EXT DREAM SPACE NIGHT

Were in Langdons vision again The sky is on fire the river
full of blood and the Veiled Woman is on the far side her arms
outstretched to us

We move closer to the Woman reach out to her veil This time we
get our hands on the veil and lift it to reveal her face

And we know that face Its Dr Elizabeth Sinskey the woman we
saw in the opening

But now we hear a deep ROAR from above We look up and see in
the fiery skies a colossal mask with a long beaklike nose and
two glowing green eyes which burn down at us

We look down afraid of the mask we look back to Dr Sinskeys
face she speaks again with great urgency --

DR SINSKEY
Seek and find

-- and then as before she glows white hot and EXPLODES in a
shower of blinding light and --

CUT TO
INT SIENNAS APARTMENT NIGHT
-- Langdons eyes open again He blinks He looks down He
sees his jacket the one Sienna took from the hospital room has
been tied around his bloody arm like a bandage The rest of the

jacket dangles over the edge of the chair hes sitting in

He lifts his head Hes in the living room of a modest apartment
Sienna sits opposite him Langdon finds his voice

LANGDON
Still in Florence

SIENNA
(nods )
My apartment
Langdon shrugs willing to go along

LANGDON
Okay

He looks around orienting himself Looks back at Sienna

LANGDON (contd)
Thank you You saved my life
15 9-20-13

SIENNA
That is my job

He smiles slightly

SIENNA (contd)
You were talking in your sleep

LANGDON
What did I say

SIENNA
Something about a plague mask

LANGDON
(recalls it)
The kind medieval doctors wore during
the Black Death Im having visions

SIENNA
Normal part of recovery from head
trauma What are you seeing

LANGDON
Hell

SIENNA
How unpleasant

LANGDON
Pretty lady there Feels like I
know hers That I left her -- behind
somewhere

SIENNA
Were you traveling with her

LANGDON
No

He looks around her apartment as Sienna picks up a pill bottle
and shakes a half a dozen small white tablets out in her hand

LANGDON (contd)
Dr Brooks --

SIENNA
Sienna

LANGDON
May I use your phone Id like to
call the police Or the US
Consulate Both actually
16 9-20-13

She holds the tablets and a glass of water out to Langdon

SIENNA
Take these first

LANGDON
What are they

SIENNA
Caffeine Youll want to be more
awake before you talk to anyone

He thinks for a moment decides to trust her He takes the pills
He checks the time but again his wrist is empty

LANGDON
My watch Was I wearing it when I
got to the hospital

SIENNA
I dont remember a watch

LANGDON
Its very important to me

SIENNA
Im sorry
(she gets up)
Ill be back in a few minutes Well
figure out how to get you help

LANGDON
Where are you going

SIENNA
To find you some clothes I have a
neighbor whos about your size
Hes away and Im feeding his cat

LANGDON
I want to call the police

SIENNA
Feel free But I suggest you think
very hard about why someone would
want to kill you first And why you
were saying youre sorry Theyre
the first questions the police will
ask Your situation may be more
complicated than you think and
Italian courts are not always friendly
to foreigners
17 9-20-13

Langdon nods She has made sense to him but she has certainly
not comforted him

He hears the front door of the apartment open then close softly
behind her as she leaves

He looks around the room At a desk on the far side he sees an
open laptop computer

MOMENTS LATER

Langdon is seated at the desk typing into Google He enters his
own name hits return

A string of hits come up -- lectures books by Vatican statements
regarding -- but nothing indicating anything thats happened
recently He frowns

ON THE SCREEN

he opens an e mail sign-in page and enters his screen name and
password

He studies the list of e mail as it comes up -- the subject headers
are quick question Professor oe

hey check out this video you
have a Linked-In request from all the usual junk from a busy
but fairly uneventful life

AT THE DESK

Langdon closes the computer frustrated He rubs his head
thinking

INT SIENNAS BATHROOM DAY
Langdon comes into the small bathroom in Siennas apartment He
runs the water in the sink He looks out the window to his left

where the sun is just rising over Florence

Its gorgeous but what the hell am I doing here He splashes
water on his face

In the other room he hears the door of the apartment CLOSE
Siennas voice calls out to him

SIENNA (0S)
Ill leave the clothes on the
doorknob

LANGDON
Thank you

He plunges his face into the water in the sink
18 9-20-13

INT SIENNAS BEDROOM DAY

In Siennas bedroom a pair of jeans and a blouse are tossed on
the bed Sienna still in her scrubs goes to her dresser

A mirror hangs over it She too regards her reflection She
reaches up to her hair adjusts it delicately --

-- and then removes it

The blonde hair is a wig and beneath it Sienna is bald Shes
still striking perhaps even more so than she was with hair

She holds the wig carefully and picks up a hair pick Strand by
strand she moves each bit of hair back into place taking special
care with the pony tail

INT SIENNAS BATHROOM DAY

Langdon is nearly finished washing up hes now moving on to his
bloody arm He carefully unties the sleeve of his jacket which
had been used as a bandage and reveals the wound Not quite as
bad as hed feared

He bunches up the bloody jacket and is about to toss it in the
tub when he freezes

He moves his hands on the jacket feeling something Thats odd
He lifts the jacket shakes it out He feels it again
systematically smoothing it out as he goes He gets up near the
neckline just between the shoulder blades --

-- and he feels something hard Inside the lining of the jacket

ON THE FLOOR

Langdon spreads the jacket out flat and slides his hand up the
inside of the back lining He hits the hard shape again

He slides his hand up feeling along the collar --

-- and an interior pocket comes open the fabric parting between
his fingers

Judging by the look on Langdons face it is safe to say hes
never seen this secret pocket in his own coat before in his life

He reaches down into it His fingers close around the hard object
within and pull it out

Its a polished metal cylinder about six inches long and rounded
at both ends like a miniature torpedo
19 9-20-13

Mystified Langdon turns the cylinder over in his hands As he
rotates it a symbol comes into view a simple trilateral icon
You dont have to be a symbologist to know a biohazard symbol
when you see one

Langdons eyes widen Siennas voice comes over

SIENNA (0S)
Its a biotube

CUT TO
INT SIENNAS KITCHEN DAY

The tube now sits in the middle of Siennas kitchen table Sienna
dressed in the jeans and blouse she picked out earlier sits across
from Langdon who wears her neighbors pants shirt and jacket
which fit pretty well

They are both staring at the cylindrical object

SIENNA
Used to transport dangerous
substances What are you doing with
it

LANGDON
Im tired of saying I dont know
But I dont What could be in it

SIENNA
A chemical agent A virus Anything
The first Ebola samples came back
from Africa in one of those

She picks it up and studies it

SIENNA (contd)
High end unit Lead-lined titanium
Im guessing government issue

She points to a postage stamp sized black pad flanking the
biohazard symbol

SIENNA (contd)
Thumbprint recognition Security in
case its lost or stolen Tubes
like this can only be opened by a
specified individual

She looks at him He sees what shes thinking
20 9-20-13

LANGDON
Youre out of your mind
SIENNA
Try it
LANGDON

I have never owned a tube like that
in my life

SIENNA
One way to find out

Almost rashly Langdon reaches out presses his thumb on the black
pad --

LANGDON
There is no way this is-

-- and the tube HISSES and the top CLICKS open a half an inch
Langdon yanks his hand back startled and then just as quickly
reaches out and CLICKS the tube shut again dropping it back in
the middle of the kitchen table as if it were on fire

LANGDON (contd)
Im calling the Consulate now

SIENNA

I think thats a mistake
LANGDON

I disagree
SIENNA

You dont know whats going on and
we dont know who to trust The
tube is government issue that could
mean any number of things

LANGDON
Youre suggesting Im on the run
from my own government

SIENNA
Someone shot you in the head I think
that warrants a certain degree of
suspicion dont you

He stands not willing to discuss it further Hes a little
unsteady on his feet
21 9-20-13

SIENNA (contd)
Please sit down before you fall
down Ill get you the number
IN HER LIVING ROOM A FEW MINUTES LATER

Langdon is on the couch Siennas living room phone cradled to
his ear He appears to be on hold

On the other end of the phone a DEEP VOICE picks up

VOICE (0S)
Mr Langdon

LANGDON
Yes Speaking

VOICE (0S)
Thank heavens youre alive Professor
Weve been lookingsfor you

Langdon hesitates He looks up at Sienna

LANGDON
You have

VOICE (0S)
Are you still in possession

Langdon doesnt answer He puts a hand on the phone WHISPERS to
Sienna

LANGDON
They already know

SIENNA
I understand youre American and you
inherently trust people but take my
word for it not all of them deserve
it Please think about this

Langdon rubs his forehead thinking

VOICE (0S)
Mr Langdon

LANGDON
Im still here

VOICE (0S)
Do you have the tube
22 9-20-13

LANGDON
(pause)
Yes

VOICE (0S)
Where are you located

The Voice is smooth and calm but its a forced calm and the
overall affect is unsettling Langdon is torn

VOICE (0S) (contd)
Professor we cant help you if we
cant find you

Langdon gets an idea He stands and looks out the window at the
building across the street Its a small hotel its address
visible on the front

LANGDON
A small hotel The Pensione la
Fierentina Room 39

VOICE (OS)
Dont move Stay in your room
Were sending someone now

CUT TO
EXT FLORENCE - STREET DAY

As the sun rises over Florence a black unmarked van cruises
through the wet streets The van seems unremarkable but as it
passes under us we get a look at the sophisticated battery of
microwave communication dishes and receivers on its rooftop

INT VAN DAY

The rooftop was nothing compared to the interior A combination
of a mobile laboratory and communications hub the van is staffed
with FOUR or FIVE MEN AND WOMEN in black uniforms a green SRS
logo emblazoned on the shirt pocket of each one

The acronym is spelled out over a bank of monitors along one wall
of the moving vehicle -- Surveillance and Response Support --
and its just vague enough to be seriously creepy

A TECHNICIAN looks up from a monitor leans back in his chair
holding a pair of headphones to one ear

TECHNICIAN
Sir
23 9-20-13

AGENT CHRISTOPH BRUDER turns from a monitor on the other side of
the van Hes steely-eyed emotionless unambiguously in charge

TECHNICIAN (contd)
Professor Langdon just accessed his
e mail account from an unmasked IP
address here in Florence

BRUDER
You have a street number

The Technician holds up one finger hang on coming through now

BRUDER (contd)
Do you have a street-

TECHNICIAN
126 Via Dolorosa apartment 3C

Bruder turns to the DRIVER

BRUDER
Move it

TECHNICIAN
Tracing a phone registered to that
address we see he also called the
United States Consulate six minutes
ago

BRUDER

(to the Driver)

Get there first Dont let him get
away again

DRIVER
Twelve minutes

He cranks the wheel hard
EXT STREET DAY

The van pulls a sharp U-turn in the middle of the street and heads
back in the opposite direction

Unfortunately a POLICE CAR parked in an alleyway sees the move
and doesnt like it The COPS inside pull out pursuing the van

INT VAN DAY

Agent Bruder looking out the tinted back window frowns He
turns to TWO PARAMILITARY TYPES on the other side of the van
24 9-20-13

BRUDER
How many follow cars do we have

PARAMILITARY 1
Two

Behind them the police car turns on its SIREN

BRUDER
Burn one Keep local police out of
this

PARAMILITARY 1
Roger that

He raises a radio to his lips and gives an order

EXT STREET

On the street there are two black sedans behind the police car
One of them accelerates pulls even with the police car then

passes it --

-- and swerves in front Cut off the police car SMASHES into
the side of the sedan

The COPS get out SHOUTING in anger and the DRIVER of the sedan
feigns ignorance I dont speak Italian Im a tourist Im so
sorry etc

At the end of the street the SRS van turns disappearing around
a corner

CUT TO
EXT SIENNAS APARTMENT - STREET DAY

Seen from outside Sienna and Langdon watch the street below from
a second floor window in her apartment

INT SIENNAS APARTMENT DAY
Inside Langdon looks up sharply seeing something down the street

LANGDON
There

She follows his gaze and sees a black BMW motorcycle glide down
the block It pulls to a stop in front of the hotel Langdon saw
across the street and the driver gets off

Its Vayentha the woman who tried to kill them at the hospital
She stands in the street consults an object in her hand looks
25 9-20-13

at the buildings on each side and then moves into the hotel her
hand going to the gun tucked in the front of her belt

Langdon and Sienna watch in disbelief

SIENNA
Robert -- the United States government
just sent someone to kill you

LANGDON
I guess wed better find out why

A FEW MINUTES LATER

Langdon presses his thumb on the black pad at the center of the
biotube

It HISSES and twists open Gripping both ends he twists it in
opposite directions the canister PINGS and he unscrews the tube
the rest of the way

He pulls the two halves apart and a black foam rubber object
falls onto Siennas kitchen table Langdon unwraps it --

-- revealing a carved cylindrical object about the size of a
roll of Life Savers

LANGDON
A cylinder seal

He turns the tube over in his hands

LANGDON (contd)
Ivory

SIENNA
No Its bone

The tube is ornately carved with the image of a three-headed
horned Satan who is in the process of eating three different men
at once one man in each of his three mouths

LANGDON
The three-headed man-eating Satan
Common image from the Middle Ages
Its associated with the Black Plague
The three gnashing mouths were
symbolic of how efficiently the plague
ate through the population

Langdon studies the tube more carefully Seven letters are carved
beneath the devil Sienna reads them aloud pronouncing them as
a word
26 9-20-13

SIENNA
Saligia

LANGDON
A Latin mnemonic invented by the
Vatican to remind Christians of the
seven deadly sins Superbia
avaritia luxuria invidia gula
ira and acedia

SIENNA
Pride greed lust envy gluttony
wrath and sloth

LANGDON
You know Latin

SIENNA
I grew up Catholic I know sin

She is far too attractive for that remark to be fair Langdon
glances at her then back at the tube

LANGDON
According to medieval religious
teachings the collective sins of
mankind were the reason God punished
us with the Black Death More plague
references Explains my visions
Sort of

He turns the tube upside down and there is a soft CLICKING from
inside it

Curious he turns it the other way listening carefully The
CLICKING again

SIENNA
Robert look

He turns it back to look at the end that was facing her
There is a soft white glow coming from that end of the tube
Langdon stares at it and the glow fades

They look at each other He shakes it gently once more It CLICKS
again and the glow returns then fades

He tips it once again and points the glass end of the tube at
the palm of his hand A faint reddish light appears projected
onto his skin
27 9-20-13

SIENNA (contd)
A test tube With an agitator ball

LANGDON
Nope

Without warning Langdon starts to shake the tube violently The
object inside rattles back and forth CLICKING faster and faster

SIENNA
What are you doing

Langdon goes to the kitchen light switch and flicks it off
plunging the room into half-light

LANGDON
Its a Faraday pointer

He pulls the blind in the kitchen the room goes dark and he
puts the pointer on the kitchen table aiming it at a blank space
on the wall

On Siennas kitchen wall there appears a vivid high-definition
photograph that emanates from the tube as if from a slide
projector

The scene projected from the pointer is a grim oil painting of
human suffering thousands of souls undergoing wretched tortures
in various levels of hell

LANGDON (contd)
Now that explains my visions

Sienna covers her mouth in horror and they both take a step toward
it to examine it more closely

LANGDON (contd)
Botticellis Map of Hell Painted
as an illustration of Dantes Inferno

SIENNA
La Mappa dellInferno

The pit of hell is divided into descending terraces of increasing
misery each level populated by tormented sinners of every kind

LANGDON
Dante defined our modern visions of
hell And theres no map of his
hellscape more complete and accurate
than Botticellis
28 9-20-13

He walks closer to it right up to the wall studying one
particular area of it But the image starts to fade as he looks

LANGDON (contd)
Shake it again

Sienna goes to it shakes the pointer violently and the image
returns

LANGDON (contd)
Move it back

She slides it back on the table which makes the image on the
wall larger Langdon steps up to one certain area near the bottom
of the funnel-shaped hell

Langdon squints at it Here he sees images of legs upside down
their owners bodies buried headfirst

AN IMAGE FLASHES IN HIS MIND

of the dream he had earlier on the banks of the river of blood
the legs twisting in agony And the letter R written on the
thigh of one of them

BACK IN SIENNAS KITCHEN
Langdon blinks studies the projected image

LANGDON
Thats odd
(he points)
This area The Malebolge Dantes
eighth level the word means evil
ditches There are ten of them

He moves along the wall studying the other legs in the painting
They all have letters on them different ones all on the thighs

LANGDON (contd)
These letters arent on the original
The painting has been modified

Sienna reads them aloud

SIENNA
C-A-T-R-O-V-A-C-E-R

LANGDON
Catrovacer Is that Italian

SIENNA

No Not Latin either
29 9-20-13

He turns back to the wall image moving closer still and as he
stares at it he sees an image of the original painting flashing

in his mind like a memory

LANGDON
Why would someone alter the image

He looks closer still
LANGDON (contd)
Theres something else written here

Its English

He moves closer to it squints Feels instinctively in his shirt
pocket for his reading glasses but of course theyre not there

LANGDON (contd)
The truth can be glimpsed only
through the eyes of death Zobrist

Siennas eyes widen

SIENNA
Bertram Zobrist

LANGDON
Whos that

SIENNA

Hes famous in medical circles
Infamous actually

LANGDON
Why

SIENNA
Zobrist was the worlds foremost
bioengineer when he wrote an essay
that declared the human race was on
the brink of extinction and unless
we had a catastrophic event that
precipitously decreased global
population growth our species would
not survive He said his advances
in genetic engineering would be far
more helpful to mankind if they were
used not to cure disease but rather
to create it

LANGDON
He advocated the creation of a plague
30 9-20-13

SIENNA
Rumor is he went further than that
They say he actually designed such a
plague two years ago one that would
kill off half the worlds population

Langdon horrified turns back to the wall and runs a hand over
it as if absorbing the map with his fingertips

LANGDON
And now hes re-created a map of
hell Put abundant references to
plague and death in it As a kind
of puzzle

SIENNA
To lead to what The plague itself
What kind of lunatic would do that

LANGDON
(a mutter)
It happens

Hes at the wall just inches from it studying the painting
closely

LANGDON (contd)
But why in Gods name do I have it

From the street outside Sienna hears the sound of car tires
SQUEALING She goes to the window

At the wall Langdon is just inches from the painting his mind
racing

LANGDON (contd)
The levels Theyre out of order

Running his hand over the image he mutters to himself fast
almost impossible to understand hes going so quickly

LANGDON (contd)
-- seducers whipped by demons
flatterers adrift in human excrement
thats wrong clerical profiteers
no -- thieves bitten by snakes that
goes up here counselors consumed by
fire sowers of discord down there --

At the window Sienna parts the drape carefully and peers out
into the street

OUTSIDE
31 9-20-13

she sees the black SRS van and its follow sedan as they pull
up in front of the building Armed MEN IN UNIFORM climb out and
Agent Bruder meets them giving orders
They spread out heading for Siennas building
IN THE KITCHEN

Sienna turns back to Langdon urgently

SIENNA
Robert

LANGDON
(still staring at the wall)
Its an anagram Catrovacer

SIENNA
We have to go

LANGDON
Straighten out the levels

SIENNA
We really have to go

She grabs the pointer off the table and shoves it in her pocket
The sudden disappearance of the image brings Langdon around and
he turns toward her excited

LANGDON
I know why Im in Florence

SIENNA
Tell me on the way

CUT TO
EXT SIENNAS BUILDING DAY
Vayentha is just coming out of the hotel across the street but
she freezes in the doorway seeing the SRS van and its troops
who are now entering the front of Siennas building

She hesitates leaning back in the doorway to avoid being seen

VAYENTHA
Damn
32 9-20-13

AT THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING

Agent Bruder directs his men silently with gestures Two of
them move to the right to a side entrance and the other two
follow him toward the main entrance

Bruder closes a fist and with military precision the men move
into Siennas building

We stay in the street and can hear see them through stairwell
windows as they move quickly up to the second floor --

-- we hear a SHOUT and a sharp CRACK of breaking wood as they
kick in the door of Siennas apartment --

-- we see them through the window of Siennas apartment as they
search the place weapons drawn voices raised --

-- and then we hear a ROAR down below and the camera whips down
back to street level --

-- and to the entrance of the buildings garage where a three-
wheeled motorcycle GUNS IT up the ramp tires SQUEALING as it
turns sharply into the street

Sienna drives Langdon on the seat behind her holding on tight
as she races away from the building

One of the SRS troops comes racing out the front door of the
building levels his rifle and FIRES a shot at the trike as it
races away

ON BOARD THE TRIKE

the shot SMASHES the taillight at the top of the seat just inches
below the base of Langdons spine

LANGDON
Jesus

Sienna punches the gas and the trike ROARS away She SHOUTS back
over her shoulder as they race down the street

SIENNA
Where are we going

LANGDON
The Palazzo Vecchio

She nods she knows the place and she hits the gas as they round
a corner hard
33 9-20-13

AROUND A CORNER

they almost hit a WOMAN whos hurrying across the street just
ahead of them and it forces Sienna to hit the brakes and swerve

The woman in the crosswalk freezes staring at them and Langdon
stares back at her his eyes going wide --

-- BECAUSE ITS THE WOMAN FROM HIS VISIONS
IN A VISION

Langdon sees a fleeting glimpse of Dr Sinskeys face again by
the river of blood it EXPLODES INTO WHITE LIGHT

BACK ON THE BIKE

and Sienna hits the gas again racing away into the narrow snaking
streets as Langdon looks back over his shoulder at the shrinking
image of the woman from his dreams

LANGDON
That was her

SIENNA
Who

He puts a hand to his head in pain again If only he knew
CUT TO
EXT SIENNAS APARTMENT DAY

We watch from a distance as Bruder and the other SRS agents
come out of Siennas building and head back for the van aware
now that theyve lost Langdon

But theyve picked up another presence -- LOCAL POLICE scream
around both ends of the block and SQUEAL to a halt cutting off
the van Bruder holds his hands up pulls out credentials heads
for the CARBINIERI to explain

Pulling back we find Vayentha in the foreground at the mouth of
an alley astride her motorcycle

She pulls a cell phone from her pocket takes a breath and pushes
an autodial number On the other end it rings once then a VOICE
answers

There is a series of odd CLICKS and PINGS --
CUT TO
EXT OPEN SEA DAY

-- and suddenly were flying over an emerald sea closing in on
an odd-looking gray ship at sail jon the choppy waters For the
record its a HIBIKI class ocean surveillance ship with a tall
densely-packed communications tower at the front a helipad at
the rear and a twin-hulled open center keel

The CLICKS and PINGS continue over the wide shot as we circle
down toward the ship and a row of opaque glass windows twenty
feet above the water line --

INT CRG SHIP - COMM CENTER DAY

-- and into the ship and the hub of its communications center
To describe the place as high-tech does a disservice to it Most
of its tech looks like it hasnt even been invented yet

We settle on one of the cubicles in the comm center where a
TECHNICIAN in a headset speaks with the voice from Vayenthas
phone call

TECHNICIAN
(British accent)
Mother isnt going to like that
Try to reacquire and make contact in
sixty minutes

He hits a switch disconnecting the call and gets up hurrying
down the row of cubicles to a metal staircase at the far end He
bounds up it

INT SHIPS CORRIDOR DAY

The Technician makes his way down a narrow ships corridor with a
name painted in large letters -- CONTROL RISKS GROUP LLC
35 9-20-13

He reaches a door at the far end KNOCKS once

TECHNICIAN

A VOICE calls from inside and the Technician opens the doors
INT HARRY SIMS OFFICE DAY
The Technician steps into the cabin and closes the door

TECHNICIAN

HARRY SIMS looks up from behind a desk Sims is around fifty
trim and dressed in a neatly pressed suit and tie He speaks
with a British accent that suggests Mayfair and all the right
schools

SIMS
Im sorry to hear that What
operation

TECHNICIAN

Sims winces The worst possible answer He takes off his glasses
and drops them on the desk

TECHNICIAN (contd)
One of our players seems to have

He puts his glasses back on to go back to work But the
Technician hasnt moved Sims looks up at him -- what
TECHNICIAN
Professor Langdon is -- out of frame
SIMS

And in possession of the tube

TECHNICIAN
Yes

Harry Sims sighs and looks out the window of the cabin

SIMS
I was so looking forward to closing
this account What in Gods name
has this client gotten us into

The Technician looks as if hes about to answer but Sims holds
up a hand to stop him

Rhetorical

He thinks for a moment

SIMS (contd)
When are we scheduled to release the

TECHNICIAN
Twenty-four hours

CUT TO
EXT FLORENCE - STREET DAY

Sienna maneuvers the trike through the S-shaped curves of the
Viale Niccolo Machiavelli Lushly wooded landscapes pass on both
sides as she and Langdon approach the citys upscale west bank
They pass a chapel clock that CHIMES eight am

But Sienna hits the brakes and the trike skids to a stop

LANGDON
Whats the matter

She points three hundred yards up ahead to the Porta Romana
the ancient stone gateway that is the entrance to Old Florence

The gateway has massive wooden doors propped open to let traffic
pass through But the passageway is blocked by a police barricade
and a long line of cars waits as each one is checked

LANGDON (contd)
Is that for us

SIENNA
Do you really want to find out

Behind them they hear SIRENS They look back and we whip over
in that direction to take a look ourselves More police cars are
approaching from the direction they came When we whip back to
the trike --

-- its empty Langdon and Sienna are moving away quickly headed
for a stone wall in the distance
38 9-20-13

EXT BOBOLI GARDENS DAY

Langdon and Sienna drop to the ground on the spongy earth on the
other side of the wall SIRENS are still audible from this side
but theyre out of sight of the roadblock inside a lush garden
expanse that must cover dozens of acres

SIENNA
I dont know what you did but you
pissed a lot of people off

They lean against the wall taking a moment to catch their breath

LANGDON
Why are you helping me Really

SIENNA
Because you are lost And rather
alone I know the feeling

LANGDON
That seems hard to believe
SIENNA
Why should it be
LANGDON
(matter-of-fact not a

come on)
Youre beautiful Beauty attracts a
lot of attention

SIENNA
Not always the right kind

On the other side of the wall MORE SIRENS Langdon looks at
Sienna

LANGDON
Thank you For everything But
whatever Im in the middle of
whatever Ive done that Im sorry
for -- its not your problem Just
leave me here Ill be all right

SIENNA
I cant do that Ima physician I
took an oath

LANGDON
To aid a fugitive
39 9-20-13

SIENNA
To cure the sick If Zobrists plague
is at the end of this trail we need
to get to it first

LANGDON
Who are the people chasing us

SIENNA
Governments People who would
weaponize the plague And Zobrist
had acolytes fanatics even more
committed to the cause than he is

LANGDON
Releasing a plague is hardly a cause

SIENNA
Robert the cause is saving the world

LANGDON
By killing half of it Hes insane

SIENNA
I dont know Iveystudied a fair
amount of biology Species frequently
go extinct from overpopulating their
environment But when catastrophic
events occur they permit new growth
Remember what the Black Plague
produced

LANGDON
Misery and death

SIENNA
And a leaner population that gave
birth to the Renaissance

LANGDON
Thats a bit dark for my taste

SIENNA
In his essay Zobrist asked a famous
hypothetical -- if you could throw a
switch and randomly kill half the
population of the earth would you
do it

LANGDON
Of course not
40 9-20-13

SIENNA
But if you were told that if you
didnt throw that switch the human
race would be extinct in the next
hundred years would you do it
then

LANGDON
If I could Sienna I would prevent
the death of half the species Any
other action is inhumane

She looks at him and smiles

SIENNA
Then perhaps we should keep moving

From the other side of the wall they hear SHOUTS as police find
the abandoned trike

He takes her by the arm and leads her off into the gardens
INT HOLLOW DAY

A pathway curls into an enclosed hollow with faux-bois benches
and a small fountain Langdon and Sienna look around make sure
theyre alone

LANGDON
Give me the pointer

She does He shakes it up generating light again and shines it
on the bench in front of them

LANGDON (contd)
Zobrist not only added letters but
he changed the order of the sins
Catrovacer isnt a word it doesnt
make sense But put in the proper
order the letters form two words
Cerca trova

SIENNA
Seek and find

LANGDON
Its what she kept saying The woman
in my vision

SIENNA
Then it was already in your
subconscious

(MORE )
41 9-20-13

SIENNA (contd)
You must have deciphered this before
you arrived at the hospital youve
seen this image already

LANGDON
Your hospital is across the street
from the Palazzo Vecchio In the
Palazzos Hall of Five Hundred
theres a famous mural Giorgio
Vasaris Battaglia di Marciano
Near the top of the mural is a coded
message its one of the art worlds
most famous mysteries

SIENNA
What is the message

LANGDON
Cerca trova

He looks down at the Faraday pointer in his hand A change has
come over his face

LANGDON (contd)
At the hospital When I said I was

sorry
SIENNA

Very sorry Over and over
LANGDON

I assumed Id done something terrible
But thats not what I meant I was
saying the artists name -- Vasari
Not very sorry Vasari

His relief is intense

LANGDON (contd)
It means I might not have done
anything wrong Maybe its better
if I stop running

SIENNA
Every time you stop running someone
shoots at you

He looks at her

LANGDON
Fair point
42 9-20-13

They hear a BUZZING sound from overhead and both look up to where
a shadowy shape WHIZZES in and out of the canopy of leaves that
covers the gardens

No time to stick around and see what that thing is selling
Langdon leads Sienna off across the gardens

FROM OVERHEAD

we see their images racing across the gardens as through a long
lens

The image jumps once closer twice closer still --
EXT BOBOLI GARDENS - MAIN GATE DAY

-- and a third time until it FREEZE-FRAMES a grainy overhead
image of Langdon and Sienna seen from the drone aircraft that
just took their picture

The image is on a datapad held by one of Bruders agents who
have established a command base at the main entrance to the Boboli
Gardens

Theyre now assisted by local POLICE dozens of them and the
whole area resembles a crime scene

BRUDER
Thats them

He turns to a LOCAL POLICEMAN whos spread a map of the gardens
out on the trunk of a car next to him

BRUDER (contd)
The garden is walled

POLICEMAN
On all sides
(gesturing)
The only exits are through the Palazzo
Pitti on the north end and the
visitor gates on the east and west
sides

BRUDER
No other way out

POLICEMAN
None that I know of

BRUDER
A non-traditional exit A hidden
passage
43 9-20-13

POLICEMAN
(thinks)
I suppose if you count the Vasari
gate But no one knows about that
its ancient

Bruder exchanges a look with another Agent If anybody knows
its Langdon

BRUDER
Take me there
(to the Agent)
Redirect the drone

Weapons are RACKED forces deployed into the gardens

But in the street behind Bruder the REV of a motorcycle draws
our attention As Bruder moves out into the gardens the
motorcycle glides past

Vayentha GUNS the bikes engine headed around to the other side
of the gardens

CUT TO
INT HARRY SIMS OFFICE DAY

CLOSE ON a screen where an amorphous shadowy image is displayed
We hear the sound of WATER LAPPING and make out the shape of
what appears to be an underground canyon its floor like the
surface of a lake The water is illuminated lit from within

The camera tilts down to the surface of the water and then it
moves underwater to where an undulating sphere of thin plastic
wobbles like an oversize soap bubble filled with some kind of
gelatinous yellow-brown liquid Its tethered to the underwater
floor by a short filament

Still moving down we see a plaque visible on the floor of the
lit underwater space On the plaque are these words --

IN THIS PLACE ON THIS DATE
THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER

Beneath the words a date is written but we cant quite make it
out

IN HARRY SIMS OFFICE

Sims is watching the video on a big TV mounted in an alcove on
his wall Arbogast is watching with him

ARBOGAST
That date is tomorrow

SIMS
Thank you that was not lost on me

BACK ON THE SCREEN

the image cuts abruptly still in the cavernous underground place
but now to an image of a MAN standing at the edge of the water
The man stares at the camera --

-- and hes wearing a plague mask

MAN IN MASK
There comes a moment in history when
ignorance is no longer a forgivable
offense Dantes hell is not fiction
it is prophecy

IN THE OFFICE
Sims raises an eyebrow

SIMS
Oh my

From the screen the voice of the Man in the Mask continues

MAN IN MASK (0S)
Mankind if unchecked functions
like a cancer

SIMS
Oh my

ON SCREEN

the Man takes off the mask revealing Bertram Zobrist whom we
first saw in the opening with Dr Sinskey

ZOBRIST
To do nothing is to welcome Dantes
hell cramped and starving weltering
in sin And so I have taken action
Inferno sleeps beneath me preparing
to spring from its watery womb
under the watchful eye of the chthonic
monster and all her furies

Harry Sims frowns
45 9-20-13

Chthonic Is that a word

ZOBRIST
Mathematics as relentless as the
law of gravity is nonnegotiable
The same exponential blossoming of
life that has nearly killed mankind
shall also be our deliverance The
beauty of a living organism -- be it
good or evil -- is that it will follow
the law of God with singular vision
And so I shall fight fire with fire
I will-

Harry Sims sets down the remote control

SIMS
Oh I believe Ive got the gist

Sims stands removes his jacket and hangs it over the back of
his chair

SIMS (contd)
It appears our organization has spent
the last several years in the employ
of a madman who now intends to commit
mass murder using a deadly plague of
his own creation

He sits again unbuttoning the cuff of his left shirt sleeve

SIMS (contd)
Well sort out who recommended him
to our fine firm later

He opens the top right drawer of his desk Inside there is a
leather sheath with a small carved metal handle at the top He
takes it out

CUT TO

EXT BOBOLI GARDENS DAY

Langdon leads Sienna through the gardens

SIENNA
Where are we going

LANGDON
Almost there

Langdon leads them to the left of a maze garden staying under
the shadows of overhanging trees They can hear the BUZZ of the
drone somewhere nearby

Langdon leads her past a sealed metal gate through a sculpture
garden and down a set of stairs that werent visible from a
distance
47 9-20-13

ON THE STAIRS

Sienna looks ahead but all she sees is gloom up ahead -- Langdon
is leading them directly into the mouth of a cavern a deep grotto
carved out of the rear wall

SIENNA
Its a dead end

INT BUONTALENTI GROTTO DAY

Langdon presses on unfazed into the grotto Its walls are
uneven seeming to writhe with carved figures Theyre grisly
half-buried humanoids extruding from the walls as if being consumed
by the stone

Langdon cuts sharply to the left toward a small gray door to the
left of the cavern Weathered and wooden it looks like a storage
closet or a room for landscaping supplies

Langdon rushes to the door but it has no handle Only a brass
keyhole

LANGDON
Damn it This leads to the Vasari
Corridor Id hoped-

Suddenly the PIERCING WHINE of the drone echoes off the cavern
walls around them

Langdon pulls Sienna deeper into the grotto taking cover behind
a large central fountain

They peer over its edge and see the drone as it swoops down into
the walled cul-de-sac stopping at the mouth of the cavern
hovering ten feet off the ground

Langdon and Sienna look at each other Trapped

They look back as the drone settles finally landing in the
entryway to the grotto

Behind it they now hear the THUNDER of boots on the steps the
same ones they just ran down

The Italian Policeman who spoke to Bruder earlier is in the lead
with Bruder TWO SRS TROOPS just behind them

The Policeman leads Bruder to the same doorway Langdon checked
and POUNDS on it furiously

Langdon and Sienna stay hidden barely daring to breathe as the
door is unlocked from within
48 9-20-13

A GUARD opens the door and speaks to the Policeman who questions
him in Italian The Guard answers shaking his head no

Bruder asks another question or two and then satisfied he leads
the others out of the grotto again

The little door SLAMS and locks
Langdon watches them go The second theyre gone --

LANGDON (contd)
We have exactly one shot at this

-- he darts out from behind the fountain leading Sienna by the
hand

INT GUARDS OFFICE DAY

With a KA-CHUNK the Guard who just spoke to Bruder locks a second
gate behind him and goes back tosthe little table at which he is
watching a soccer match on a tiny TV He just has his butt back
on his chair --

-- when theres ANOTHER FURIOUS KNOCKING at the back gate

The Guard gestures to the TV CURSES in Italian gets back up
goes to the first gate and unlocks it Still CURSING he goes
to the back door where the POUNDING gets even more furious He
opens that door --

-- and Sienna Brooks stands in front of him flashing her most
dazzling smile

SIENNA
Ciao

She holds out a folded piece of paper and without thinking the
Guard reaches out to accept it

As he extends his hand Sienna grabs hold of his wrist and plunges
a thumb into the bony carpal area just beneath his palm

The Guards mouth drops open hes in intense pain but no sound
comes out

Sienna moves in quickly backing the Guard up with her grip on
his wrist and Langdon follows closely behind her closing and
locking the door again

The Guard staggers trying to pull his arm free but his legs go
out and he slumps to his knees

From the TV a SHOUTED VOICE
49 9-20-13

ANNOUNCER (0S)
GOOOAAALLLLL

The Guard turns to look I mean a goal is a goal and Sienna
slides her left hand up his neck finding a spot just at the base
of his spine she pinches there --

-- and the Guards body sags unconscious
Sienna eases him to the ground She looks up at Langdon

SIENNA
Dim mak
(he looks confused)
Chinese pressure points Been around
for millennia

LANGDON
Who are you

SIENNA
I read a lot of medical texts

She pulls a set of keys off the Guards belt tosses them to
Langdon and he goes to a locked door across the room He unlocks
it revealing a staircase headed up

LANGDON
This way

She steps through --
INT STAIRWAY DAY
-- and he closes it behind them locking it from this side
LANGDON
The Vasari Corridor Locked on both
ends and it leads right over the
Ponte Vecchio Comes out at the
Palazzo
They hurry up the stairs
INTEXT VASARI CORRIDOR DAY
The stairs put out in an open arched corridor that runs along
the river But just as Sienna takes the first step out into the

open Langdon hears the BUZZ of the drone again

He reaches out grabs her arm and pulls her back hard She
ends up pressed up against him
50 9-20-13

The DRONE appears looking malevolent as it trains its optics on
the exposed corridor and starts a long slow sweep down the length
of it

Sienna looks up at Langdon who still holds her close

SIENNA
Thank you

He nods They watch the drone as it moves slowly down the length
of the Vasari Corridor

LANGDON
Were stuck here till it finishes
its sweep

She nods They wait He releases her and she takes a small step
back but theyre still closer than one would normally be hidden
here in a tiny alcove

Langdon checks his left wrist for the time but rubs it realizing
again his watch isnt there

SIENNA
You cant get used to that Who
gave it to you

He looks at her Shes holding his eyes very direct So he
tells her

LANGDON
My parents Last thing they gave me
before they died

SIENNA
Then you really have no one No
wife
Langdon winces as
AN IMAGE
flashes through his mind -- the Veiled Woman Dr Sinskey looking

up at him on a street somewhere but it barely registers and
BACK IN REALITY
he blinks it away and answers Siennas question

LANGDON
No You
51 9-20-13

SIENNA
There was a man But he was a
disappointment

LANGDON
Yeah you cant look too close at
most of us

SIENNA
Easier to be alone Not happier
maybe but simpler

LANGDON
Perfect night for me is all alone at
home with a good book and a glass of
Scotch

The drone finishes its sweep to the end and banks around coming
back at them BUZZING louder than ever They stay back pressed
against the wall

SIENNA
How old were you

He looks at her He knows what she means just doesnt talk about
it much But theres something about her

LANGDON
Nine

SIENNA
I was six

They look at each other as only two people who share that history
could No Im sorrys” just a look of understanding

SIENNA (contd)
They didnt quite know what to do
with me where I grew up My brain
It grew differently from most kids
and it caused some -- health problems
I spent a lot of time trying to figure
out what was wrong with me and in
the process I learned about
neuroscience

She looks at him just as his eyes dart back down to hers He
had inadvertently thrown a glance up to her hair

SIENNA (contd)
And yes my baldness is related to
my illness
52 9-20-13

LANGDON
Im sorry

SIENNA
Cant blame you for being observant

The drone FLASHES past the archway just beside them and is gone
headed back the way it came

Now free to move they start to walk down the corridor along
the river

LANGDON
Is that why you became a doctor
Your illness

SIENNA
I saw a lot of sick kids and I wanted
to help I had this idea to design
and build ERs insdensely populated
parts of the world I spent three
years in Africa two in Manila
Have you been there

LANGDON
(shakes his head no)
Im not so good in crowds

SIENNA
There are just -- too many to help
I gave up and came home People
always told me you cant save the
world” I started to believe them

LANGDON
You cant save the world

He thinks about it for a moment then looks at her
LANGDON (contd)
I never realized what an awful thing
that is to say to someone

She smiles He understands

They reach another staircase and climb it into the part of the
corridor that goes directly over the river

CUT TO
EXT PONTE VECCHIO DAY

Langdon and Sienna race across the Vasari Corridor
53 9-20-13

Moving down quickly to the level below them we see a bow-shaped
balcony on the bridge the kind of place all the tourists go to
take pictures with the river or city in the background

Vayentha stands in the middle of it turning amidst the crowd
She looks up and sees the Vasari Corridor overhead She knows

She takes off at a run headed across the river and into Old
Florence

CUT TO
EXT BOBOLI GARDENS - MAIN ENTRANCE DAY

Bruder and his men emerge from the Boboli Gardens and meet at the
van now surrounded by police cars But this time someone else
is waiting for them -- Dr Elizabeth Sinskey

Bruder shakes his head as he approaches her

BRUDER
Im sorry Hes an extremely
resourceful man

DR SINSKEY
Which is why I brought him into this
situation

BRUDER
At some point extreme measures may
need to be applied

DR SINSKEY
Ill decide when we reach that point

BRUDER
The object hes carrying-

DR SINSKEY
-is mine Zobrist delivered it to
me That object is my responsibility
as is the Professors life

BRUDER
His behavior is not of someone who
can be trusted

DR SINSKEY
Theres no point in speculation
lets just find him

Bruder is frustrated He tries a new tack
54 9-20-13

BRUDER
How far did he get the night before
he disappeared

DR SINSKEY
To the Hall of Five Hundred

BRUDER
Then may I suggest we stop chasing
him and start anticipating him

He starts for the vehicles but Sinskey takes him by the arm and
stops him

DR SINSKEY
His life is important to me Do you
understand

BRUDER
Not really no

He gets into the van So does she
CUT TO
EXT PALAZZO VECCHIO DAY

The sprawling Palazzo Vecchio its bell tower blossoming over the
old city

INT HALL OF FIVE HUNDRED DAY

The Hall of Five Hundred was at one time the largest room in the
world Well it was Its ceiling soars high over the crimson
stone parquet floor a twelve thousand square foot expanse High
transoms on all four sides of the room let natural light flow
over the masterpieces within -- huge tapestries and the six
massive statues that make up the Labors of Hercules

Were looking at one of the tapestries now -- fifty-five feet
long and almost three stories tall Battle of Marciano depicts a
grotesque battle scene a violent panorama of horses soldiers
and spears colliding on a hillside

Langdon and Sienna stand in front of it Langdon points to a
spot near the top

LANGDON
There The top middle just below
the two farmhouses on the hillside
theres a tiny green flag --

She squints looking more closely Her face brightens
55 9-20-13

SIENNA
Cerca trova Seek and find

LANGDON
(getting irritated)
Well we sought it and found it now
what

SIENNA
What else did the drawing say The
words that were added

LANGDON
The truth can be glimpsed only
through the eyes of death

SIENNA
The eyes of death

Langdons gaze flits around the tapestry rapidly alighting on
one suffering dying face after another

LANGDON
Death Everywhere Whose eyes

He closes his own eyes and rubs them exhaustion catching up with
him

He looks up at the mural again thinking hard and the faces from
the tapestry flick by fast too fast jump cuts one after the
other horrific images tumbling through his brain --

LANGDON (contd)
-- my head Killing me I-

IN LANGDONS MIND

suddenly there are other images mixing in with the faces images
not from the mural but from his visions and memory the upside-
down legs the plague mask the lock on the door in his hospital
room as Sienna SLAMS it into place --

-- and the VEILED WOMANS FACE close to his her gaze turned up
to meet his eyes in an almost intimate way her hand on the side
of his cheek her voice a whisper --

DR SINSKEY
Maybe there are some mysteries were
not meant to solve

IN THE HALL
56 9-20-13

Langdon breaks out of it and turns away from the mural putting a
hand over his eyes Eyestrain or emotion

SIENNA
Are you all right

He nods but doesnt look at her Theres no question its
emotion

Robert Langdon is overcome

LANGDON
In your hospital When I woke up
from the dream I came out of it
with this feeling of -- loss Worse
Desolation Something was going
away And Id never get it back

He turns and looks at Sienna plaintive

LANGDON (contd)
Those two days I lost What happened
to me

VOICE (0S)
Professor

They turn

MARTA
It is you Back so soon

A PREGNANT SMILING MUSEUM GUARD walks toward them her arms
outstretched in welcome

LANGDON
(low to Sienna)
Ive never seen that woman before in
my life

MARTA reaches them as quickly as her condition will allow

MARTA
I almost didnt recognize you in
that fashionable suit Youve been
shopping

Langdon and Sienna both just stare for a moment Langdon is the
first to speak

LANGDON
Uh huh
57 9-20-13

Hes not a great actor but hes doing his best

LANGDON (contd)
Yes Yes Im sorry this is Sienna
My -- niece

Marta takes a look at Sienna then looks back at Langdon with a
knowing smile

MARTA
Youre in Italy Professor you dont
have to say niece for Gods sake

She takes Siennas hand

MARTA (contd)
Marta Alvarez Pleasure to meet
you
(back to Langdon)
Is il Duomino with»you again

Langdon raises an eyebrow he recognizes the name

LANGDON
Il Duomino No he couldnt make it
today Im sorry to trouble you
Marta but I guess you can imagine
why Im here Again

MARTA
Really Of all the treasures in the
Palazzo
(to Sienna)
He and il Duomino spent almost an
hour up there with it last night
So morbid

LANGDON
Its -- cool

MARTA
All right come on Im headed up
that way

She starts across the hall They fall into stride with her
walking quickly

MARTA (contd)
Not so fast please Im about to
burst

She puts a hand on her ample belly
58 9-20-13

MARTA (contd)
(to Sienna)
Such a romantic date he takes you
on To see a death mask

Langdon looks sharply at Sienna Sienna turns to Marta

SIENNA
A death mask

MARTA
They were common practice in the
1500s Its essentially just a
plaster cast of someones face made
a few moments after that person dies

LANGDON
Through the eyes of death

SIENNA
And whose face was used for this
particular mask

MARTA
The poet Dante

CUT TO
INT PALAZZO - STAIRCASE DAY

Marta breathing heavily leads them up a staircase to a landing
above the Hall of Five Hundred

MARTA
It is a romantic story I suppose
Dante loved Florence as much as anyone
could ever love a city He was
prominent and powerful but the
political winds changed and he was

exiled -- thrown outside the city
walls and told he could never come
back

She leads them down a hallway arrives at a closed door and RAPS
three times

Keys RATTLE in the door and its opened by an OLDER MUSEUM GUARD
He sees Langdon and smiles delighted to see him

GUARD
Signore Welcome back
59 9-20-13

LANGDON
(getting used to it)
Thanks Great to be back

He gestures come in
INT PALAZZO GALLERY DAY

Marta leads them into a gallery empty at this early hour She
continues the story

MARTA
Some people say Dantes exile was
the reason his death mask looks so
sad But the romantics believe its
because of his great love for
Beatrice

She leads them around a corner and through another gallery

MARTA (contd)
Dante fell for her when he was young
but they had only a few stolen moments
together before life tore them apart
and Beatrice married another man
Dante was forced to live without the
woman or the city he loved

Up ahead is a small alcove

MARTA (contd)
And so when he died as a final
gesture of kindness his mask -- was
brought home to Florence

She reaches the entry to the alcove and gestures -- here we are

MARTA (contd)
Its in the display case on the wall
to your left We ask that you stay
behind the stanchions

LANGDON
Thank you

He and Sienna walk to the left and stop in front of the single
display case there lit by a light from above

They stare stunned

LANGDON (contd)
Marta --
60 9-20-13

The Guard turns from the doorway She walks over to them and
follows their gaze to the display case

She looks at it for a brief uncomprehending moment --

-- and then turns and runs from the gallery pulling a whistle
that hangs from a chain around her neck and blowing hard its
piercing SHRIEKS echoing off the walls of the gallery

Finally we get a look at the display case
Its empty

CUT TO
INT MUSEUM - SECURITY WING DAY

A card SWIPES through a card-reader a door lock BUZZES and we
shove through

Moving fast we reach a second door swipe a card there too
another door BUZZES and we go through

Were backstage at the museum in the security wing being led by
a SOMBER MAN in a gray suit whos doing all the swiping and
shoving Marta is beside him they speak in urgent Italian and
Langdon and Sienna are just behind

TWO MORE GUARDS these in uniforms are behind them
INT VIDEO ROOM DAY

In the main surveillance room of the museum the group now stands
before an array of video screens off to one side The main screen
shows a surveillance image of the gallery they were just in and
its scrubbing through the tape at high speed

MUSEUM VISITORS come and go in a blur pausing in front of the
masks display case to admire it then moving on The timestamp
on the video races forward to the end of the day

There is a lot of muttered Italian and sharp disagreements among
the Security Personnel but nobody bothers translating the
situation is too serious

Langdon and Sienna watch the screen closely as the late afternoon
sun moves across the floor of the gallery quickly Then all at
once the museum visitors disappear and the lighting shifts to
near-darkened night lighting

The VIDEO TECHNICIAN steps up the speed the timestamp clock starts
to really zip by now it gets all the way up to 10 pm and on
the screen the lights in the gallery suddenly flick back on
61 9-20-13

The Security Director gives an order in Italian and the Technician
slows the tape down to real time They watch for a moment

-- and see Robert Langdon and a heavy man in his sixties walk
into the frame Marta is leading them across the gallery to the
Dante mask

MARTA
There Thats us

SECURITY DIRECTOR
Let it play from here

LANGDON
(to Sienna)
Thats Ignazio Busoni Director of
the Museo dellOpera dell Duomo
Ive known him for years hes a
Dante scholar

SIENNA
You called him

LANGDON
I must have

They all watch the screen intently as Langdon and Ignazio move
around the display case studying the mask carefully

ON SCREEN

Langdon steps over the stanchions and gets close to the glass
case Marta (the on-screen version of her) steps forward and
admonishes him to step back

IN THE ROOM
Marta looks at Langdon

MARTA
Sorry I was so strict The masks
owner insists on the stanchions to
keep people back He wont even
permit staff to open the case without
him present

LANGDON
The owner The mask doesnt belong
to the museum

MARTA
No
(MORE )
62 9-20-13

MARTA (contd)
A private collector bought it from
us and allows us to display it in
perpetuity Its a common practice
a way of raising funds

LANGDON
Who is the collector

MARTA
Bertram Zobrist

Sienna and Langdon both react Marta notices
MARTA (contd)
Youve heard of him The Swiss

billionaire

SIENNA
Yes Ive -- heardsof him

Marta notices something on screen
MARTA
Ah there Thats when I got the
call
ON SCREEN

Marta excuses herself Now Langdon and Ignazio step freely over
the stanchions and study the mask more closely

IN THE ROOM

there is much disapproval and TSKING Langdon glances away
embarrassed at his video-self --

-- and he stops noticing something the others havent
On a cork board above a Technicians empty desk there is a white
envelope pinned there with a tack Nothing so strange about

that nothing that would ordinarily catch a persons eye

But theres a name on the front of the envelope in block letters
Just a first name

ROBERT

Langdon looks around the room Nobody is looking at the real
him theyre all too intent on the video-him

He slides a few feet to his right pulls the tack out of the board
and takes the envelope down
63 9-20-13

He opens it quietly while the others study the screen
Inside is a plain white sheet of paper on which four lines have
been written by hand Langdons eyes skim down to the bottom of
the page to where a name has been signed in a flowery hand

IGNAZIO

ON SCREEN

video-Langdon and Ignazio are huddled in urgent debate near the
case They turn and look to see if Marta is coming back

IN THE ROOM

Langdons eyes scan the note quickly He reads the first two
lines

I assume they will detain you and bring you here
For obvious reasons I must disappear for a little while
What you seek is safely hidden

Langdon looks back up to see if anybodys watching him and to
check the video screen

ON SCREEN

he watches himself reach into the pocket of his jacket and pull
something out

IN THE ROOM
he looks back down at the note quickly and finishes reading

The gates are open to you but you must hurry
Paradise Twenty-five

And then the flowery signature -- IGNAZIO

Langdon furrows his brow but before he can puzzle out the clue
he hears a GASP in the room and looks up again

ON SCREEN

he sees what he has pulled from his pocket -- its a pair of
surgical gloves

The live-Langdon watches in shock as the video-Langdon pulls on
the gloves nods to his friend Ignazio to open the back of the
case which he does --

-- AND LANGDON HIMSELF REMOVES THE DEATH MASK
64 9-20-13

IN THE ROOM

there are GASPS of shock expressions of horror at whats
transpiring on screen

Real-Langdon shoves Ignazios note in his pocket before anyone
can see it and he watches the screen as amazed as the others

ON SCREEN
he sees himself lift the mask carefully holding it up to the
light in front of his own face For a moment his eyes are
visible through the mask
IN THE ROOM
Marta stammers in disbelief

MARTA (contd)

Professor I -- I dont know what to
say I am appalled

LANGDON
Through the eyes of death
SIENNA
Youre looking for something on the

back
ON SCREEN
Langdon and Ignazio look up suddenly as if they hear someone
coming Langdon pulls out a large Ziploc bag drops the mask in
it and they hurry off completing the theft
IN THE ROOM

everyone is staring at Langdon in shock Sienna included

LANGDON
I can explain

The Security Director turns pulling a handgun from a shoulder
inside his suitcoat

SECURITY DIRECTOR
Yes I think that would be a good
idea The police will-

But before we can find out what the police will do a DEAFENING
SERIES OF ALARMS goes off in the security office

All eyes turn back to the screens
65 9-20-13

TECHNICIAN
Armed intruders From three separate
entrances

The doors on either side of the security office BANG open as MORE
PERSONNEL pour into the control room the Security Director turns
and looks back at the computer screens

ON THE LIVE SCREENS

he sees Agent Bruder and his men armed with submachine guns
racing through the entrances to the museum their weapons setting
off every alarm and metal detector in the place

IN THE ROOM

The Security Director shouts out orders in Italian and everybody
snaps into action the Director holsters his weapon and switches
to English as he turns back to Langdon --

SECURITY DIRECTOR
You will wait here for the police
until-

-- but Langdon and Sienna are gone

The Director looks up to the side exits their doors left open
by the influx of personnel

He SWEARS in Italian
CUT TO
INT MUSEUM - GALLERY DAY

Langdon and Sienna walk as quickly as they can across a gallery

in the museum They move fast but not so fast as to draw
immediate attention The SHOUTS of Bruders Agents the THUNDERING
of footsteps and the SHRIEK of museum alarms echo off the walls
all around them

Sienna holds the note that Ignazio left for Langdon in her hand
and has just finished reading it

SIENNA
Paradise Twenty-five’
mean by that

what does he

LANGDON
It must be a reference to Dantes
Divine Comedy Paradise Canto
XXV He says itll tell us where
he hid the mask
66 9-20-13

SIENNA
Canto XXV -- what does it say

LANGDON
Its fourteen thousand lines of
archaic Italian I dont happen to
remember that part

SIENNA
Just asking

LANGDON
I need to find a copy of the book

She looks at him and smiles

SIENNA
Youre quaint

Up ahead a TOURIST is just finishing a phone call She drops
her Sony Xperia Lite 4G smartphone in her purse which hangs
loosely over her shoulder

Sienna steers toward the Tourist and as they hurry past her she
dips a hand into the womans purse lifts the phone --

-- and tosses it to Langdon who catches it

SIENNA (contd)
Google it

LANGDON
You cant -- that isnt --

She grabs him by the arm and makes sure he keeps moving An
ANNOUNCEMENT comes on the PA system in Italian and most of the
TOURISTS groan in irritation

LANGDON (contd)
Whatd it say

SIENNA
The museum is being closed for a
security emergency Everyone is to
go to the nearest exit

LANGDON
Then we go this way Through Armenia

Theyve reached an intersection of hallways and he leads her
off sharply to the right
67 9-20-13

SIENNA

crowd

She enters the Palazzo
INT MAIN ENTRY DAY

There is chaos in the main entry TOURISTS are being bottlenecked
and detained at the doors Bruders Agents are checking them one

by one and Bruder stands at the center of all of it giving orders
in both Italian and English

A MUSEUM GUARD reports to Bruder

GUARD

Behind him Vayentha manages to slip past She moves deeper into
the museum

INT HALL OF GEOGRAPHICAL MAPS DAY

A six-foot tall globe the Mappa Mundi stands in the center of
the Hall of Geographical Maps Fifty-three large scale maps
hand-painted on leather hang from the walls depicting the world
as it was known in the 1550s

Langdon and Sienna burst into the room and go to the walls

LANGDON
Find Armenia Its in here somewhere
Ive been through it

They split up going to opposite walls

SIENNA
Here Armenia

He hurries across the room to where she stands before a map of
Armenia in a massive wooden frame

Langdon grabs the edge of the frame and heaves it toward him
The entire map swings into the room along with a large section
of the wall and wainscoting revealing a hidden passageway

SIENNA (contd)
(impressed)
Professor How worldly

She hurries through the opening into the dim space beyond

INT BEHIND THE MAP DAY

Langdon follows her through and pulls the wall closed behind them
Theyre in a pale stone hallway lit only by faint natural light

that filters through a series of leaded windows

The passageway descends fifty yards or so to a wooden door Sienna
starts for it --

LANGDON
Not that way

-- and he turns instead to his left where a narrow ascending
staircase is blocked by a chain and a sign that says USCITA
VIETATA

SIENNA
It says no exit
69 9-20-13

LANGDON
Im not the only one who knows about
that map
He climbs over the chain and hurries up the stairs She follows

INT SECRET STAIRCASE DAY

Langdon races up the staircase Sienna just behind him A door
at the top is marked Sala die Modelli di Architettura

He pushes it open

INT ARCHITECTURE MODELS ROOM DAY

The room is a tiny space one small window only one entrance

BEHIND THE MAP

Bruder sees the staircase leading to the door at the bottom and
races down it

He throws it open --
EXT PALAZZO TERRACE WALKWAY DAY

-- and winces from the blinding light of the outside He looks
out across the rooftops

Ahead of him is the high vaulted roof of the Hall of Five Hundred
Impossible to traverse

To the left and right are a narrow walkway He orders two Agents
to the left two others to the right and they creep carefully
along it searching
70 9-20-13

INT ARCHITECTURAL MODELS ROOM DAY

CLOSE ON a cell phone screen which displays half a dozen lines
of scrolling text

Langdon and Sienna are in the architectural models rooms and
hes reading lines of Dante off the stolen cell phone

Hes reading fast MURMURING to himself

LANGDON
If it should happen if this sacred
poem -- this work so shared by heaven

and by earth that it has made me
lean through these long years --

Sienna is at the door listening to the sounds of Bruders agents
outside She speaks in a WHISPER

SIENNA
Theyre downstairs

Langdon keeps reading concentrating Sienna hears a SOUND and
turns looks to the window --

LANGDON
By then with other voice with other
fleece

The SOUND outside gets louder Sienna moves quickly across the
room grabs hold of Langdon and pulls him down hard into a
sitting position on the floor --

-- just as the SHADOW OF A GUNMAN moves out onto the thin ledge
outside the window

LANGDON (contd)
(still reading)
I shall return as poet and put on
at my baptismal font the laurel
crown

The Gunman stops outside his silhouette visible through the
window Did he hear them

SIENNA
Keep your voice down

But Langdon only has eyes for the phone and the lines of text
He repeats in a whisper

LANGDON
at my baptismal font
71 9-20-13

The Gunman moves on Sienna breathes a sigh of relief and looks
at Langdon

SIENNA
Your powers of concentration are
impressive

LANGDON

Il Duomo The Cathedral where Dante
was baptized

He stands So does Sienna

LANGDON (contd)
And where Ignazio works Thats
where he hid the mask

SIENNA
How do we get out of here

INT HALL OF GEOGRAPHICAL MAPS DAY

Bruder and his Agents come back up the stairs and stop at the
open map door Bruder points down the stairs

BRUDER
Two agents at exterior door and two
more here Keep the door open

Two Agents step up to the open map door and take position on either
side of it

BRUDER (contd)
Lets go Where next

He nods to the remaining Agents and the Museum Guard and they
take off

INT ARCHITECTURAL MODELS ROOM DAY

CLOSE ON an overhead shot of the Palazzo itself but its tiny
and cutaway an architects model of the place

Langdon is pointing to a narrow passageway on one side of the
place

LANGDON
(quietly)
Its called the Duke of Athens
Stairway and it descends to a tiny
escape hatch on a side street
72 9-20-13

SIENNA
Its on the complete opposite side
of the palace Well never get there

Langdon crosses the exhibit room to what looks like a large
cupboard in the wall one yard square about three feet off the
floor

He grabs a handle and heaves open the door revealing a cavernous
void beyond

LANGDON
I didnt say it would be comfortable

Langdon grabs a flashlight off the wall hoists himself through
the opening and disappears into the rabbit hole Sienna smiles
and races across the room into the cupboard

INT LA SOFFITA - ATTIC SPACE DAY

A flashlight CLICKS on and pierces the darkness Langdon stands
in a cloud of musty ancient air centuries of plaster dust
swirling gently around him

Spreading out before him is a seemingly endless tunnel an attic
space crisscrossed by a wooden web of posts and beams that make
up the invisible skeleton of the vaulted ceiling of the roof of
the Hall of the Five Hundred

Sienna steadies herself on the beam beside him He swings the
flashlight down and over showing her the pathway across -- its
a series of narrow catwalks planks laid down haphazardly across
the space

LANGDON
(whispering)
Were directly above the Hall of the
Five Hundred The stairway is on
the other side

She nods He starts across shining the light at the beams beneath
them

LANGDON (contd)
Youre not afraid of heights are
you

She looks up at him She is

SIENNA
Does it matter
73 9-20-13

LANGDON
Guess not
They start across
INT HALL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED DAY

Were looking up at the spectacular ceiling of the Hall of the
Five Hundred where Vasari canvases make up its fluttering surface

Tilting down fast we see Vayentha who has come down the stairs
still searching the place

INT ATTIC SPACE DAY
Up in the attic space Langdon and Sienna make their way carefully
across the boards Langdon moves quickly but Sienna slowed by
her fear of heights places her feet more slowly
LANGDON
Its okay -- one after the other
Youre fine

She looks up at him smiles at his reassurance --

-- and puts a foot wrong She stumbles her foot sliding off the
edge of the plank she trips --

-- Langdon drops the flashlight reaching out to grab her --

-- she falls --

-- and he manages to hold on dropping himself flat on the board
Hes holding on to her by one hand and she dangles there over
the empty space

But the flashlight rolls down the plank its beam of light shining
crazily in the darkened space it drops CLATTERS on to a plank
below it drops again --

-- and THUDS into the back of one of the canvases still rolling

The piece of planking that Sienna was standing on tips off its
edge falling hard onto the planks below it CRASHING

IN THE HALL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED
Vayentha hears the CLATTER from above and looks up sharply She
sees a slight bow in one of the canvases the weight of the

flashlight pressing it down as it rolls

The flashlights beam casts a glow through the canvas
74 9-20-13

Vayenthas eyes widen Someone is up there She turns and races
up the nearest staircase

IN THE ATTIC SPACE

Langdon is straining holding onto Sienna with one hand Her
fingers slip through his and she falls again --

-- and lands on a platform ten feet below with a THUD
Langdon stands He can still see but only by the dim light coming
through the canvases from below He points to Sienna who is
below him
LANGDON
There Make your way along the ledge

and meet me on the other side

Sienna looks There is a catwalk that leads to a narrow ledge
that runs around the edge of the»room She takes off for it

ABOVE HER

Langdon starts to make his way across the rest of the catwalks
moving as fast as he can in the darkness

INT HALL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED DAY

Now Agent Bruder and his men converge in the center of the Hall
of the Five Hundred

BRUDER

Is the museum clear of tourists
AGENT

Yes sir
BRUDER

I want six men stationed here
Safeties off Fingers outside the
housing Understood

AGENT
Yes sir

Bruder looks around the room The one direction he does not look
is up

INT ATTIC SPACE DAY
Up in the attic Sienna moves as quickly as she can around the

edge of the room The ledge on which shes making her way is
narrower than the planks and she tries not to look down
75 9-20-13

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATTIC

Langdon is nearly all the way across when a BRILLIANT LIGHT from
the end of the catwalk flicks on shining in his face

He stops wincing He shields his eyes
A womans VOICE comes from behind the light
VAYENTHA

If you want to live you will do

exactly as I say
She moves the light slightly out of Langdons eyes and he sees
Vayentha standing at the end of the catwalk just in front of the
exit door

Shes holding her gun at her side

LANGDON
So you can kill me too

VAYENTHA
I can help you Everything has
changed

LANGDON
Not that much

VAYENTHA
This is the last time Ill ask

She raises her gun pointing it at his chest from just ten feet
away Langdon winces in anticipation of the shot but there is a
blur of motion from the side --

-- and SIENNA whos made it all the way around the room leaps
through the air and tackles Vayentha

The gun goes off its SHOT flying wild

INT HALL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED DAY

Bruder and the others hear the gunshot and look up at the ceiling
INT ATTIC SPACE DAY

Vayentha CRUNCHES into a low railing built around the work platform
on which she stood

The railing BREAKS Sienna lets go of her and stops her own
momentum but Vayentha driven backwards has no such option
76 9-20-13

She CRASHES through the broken railing falls twenty feet onto
the backside of one of the Vasari canvases Shes suspended there
for a second as the canvas bows she claws frantically for the

sides seeing what is about to happen --

-- and with a tremendous RIP that seems to take forever the canvas
gives way

INT HALL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED DAY

Vayentha falls for three very long seconds on her back arms
flailing dropping straight down through the cavernous Hall of
the Five Hundred until --

-- she SMACKS into the floor at Bruders feet her skull CRACKING
open on the unforgiving floor

INT ATTIC SPACE DAY

Up in the attic space Sienna stares down through the torn canvas
horrified She can see Vayentha far below a pool of blood
spreading out from her fractured skull

Sienna puts a hand to her mouth in horror

SIENNA
I didnt mean to --

LANGDON
She was about to kill me

From below they hear SHOUTS and see the heads of AGENTS start to
turn to look up at them

INT DUKE OF ATHENS STAIRWAY DAY

Seen from overhead Langdon and Sienna race down a rarely-used
stone staircase with narrow switchback stairs

They reach a tiny stone chamber at the bottom of the stairs
EXT PALAZZO VECCHIO DAY

On the back side of the Palazzo Vecchio there is a four foot
high door the kind of door you wouldnt even notice unless it
opened suddenly right in front of you

Like now The door SCRAPES open and Langdon and Sienna step
through it straightening and blinking their eyes at the sudden
daylight

They start off into the crowd blending in as best they can with
the other tourists
77 9-20-13

BUT BEHIND THEM
a TALL MAN IN SILHOUETTE sits at a cafe table Over his shoulder
we watch his head turn following Langdon and Sienna as they move

into the crowd

The Tall Man stands drops a few bills on the table and starts
down the street staying a safe distance behind them

CUT TO
INT HALL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED DAY
Vayenthas dead eyes stare up at the ceiling of the Hall of the
Five Hundred which is now teeming with LOCAL POLICE and other
OFFICIALS

A corporate jet STREAKS out of the sky and lands on a private
runway at the edge of the tarmac of Peretola Airport in Florence

MINUTES LATER

two black sedans ZIP up to the door of the plane as it is lowered
and Harry Sims glides down the steps shooting his cuffs As
before he looks impeccable

A LOCAL CRG AGENT meets him at the base of the steps and falls
into stride with Sims who never stops moving as he heads for the
rear car

EXT STREET - FLORENCE DAY

Sienna and Langdon hurry down a narrow passageway known as Via
dello Studio As they near the end of the chasmlike alleyway
they hear the THRUM of activity up ahead and the cavern on either
side of them gives way spilling them out into an enormous plaza

EXT PIAZZA DEL DUOMO DAY

The Piazza del Duomo is the ancient religious center of Florence
It bustles with tour buses and throngs of VISITORS crowding around
Florences famed Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore better known
as il Duomo

LANGDON
Il Duomo My friend Ignazio is the
director of the cathedral and all
its museums He wanted us to come
here

Sienna heads toward the cathedral but he takes her arm and steers
her gently to the side

LANGDON (contd)
This way The Baptistry of San
Giovanni
79 9-20-13

They go to a building at the right side of the plaza

LANGDON (contd)
Michelangelo famously called its
gilded bronze doors --

They join a CROWD OF TOURISTS that mills about outside the
baptistry admiring its fifteen foot tall doors each inlaid with
an intricate and breathtaking Biblical scene

LANGDON (contd)
-- the Gates of Paradise They were
commissioned as a votive offering to
God

He looks at her
LANGDON (contd)
A show of gratitude that Florence
had survived the Black Plague
CUT TO

INT BAPTISTRY OF SAN GIOVANNI DAY
Langdon and Sienna walk into the empty baptistry a stunning
high-ceilinged place naturally lit by light that pierces the dark
space through a central oculus
Langdon gazes up to a magnificent mosaic that hangs over the
altar a twenty-seven foot Jesus Christ seated in judgment over
the saved and the damned
On His left hand the sinful are stoned roasted on spikes eaten
by all manner of creatures Satan oversees the torture a horned
devil that is in the process of consuming a human being headfirst
the victims legs dangling from his mouth
Langdon blinks and has a
FLASH OF MEMORY

in which he sees the upside-down legs twisting in agony at the
edge of the river of blood and then hes

BACK IN REALITY
where he steers Sienna toward a raised platform behind a
decorative gate to a tall hexagonal plinth of carved marble

Atop its base is a polished wooden top

Langdon climbs the steps and stops in front of it
80 9-20-13

SIENNA
A baptismal font

Langdon nods He reaches out removes the cover --

-- and reveals the death mask of Dante staring up at them out of
the shadows

He lifts it gently holding it as delicately as possible by the
ears and turns it around as if to look through its eyes

There faintly carved in the top inside part of the mask are
seven letters

PPPPPPP
Sienna looks at him puzzled

SIENNA (contd)
Thats it

LANGDON

Thats enough Seven for the seven
deadlies P for peccatum Latin for
sin According to Dante the angel
who guards purgatory uses the tip of
his sword to carve the letter P into
the forehead of the sinners who climb
Mount Purgatory

SIENNA
Thats fascinating but how is it
helpful

Langdon furrows his brow noticing something He holds the mask
close to his face and SNIFFS it

LANGDON
Wet dog

Whatever that means its significant to him
NEARBY

Langdon opens a cabinet rummages around finds baptismal towels
and pulls one out

LANGDON (contd)
Acrylic gesso smells like wet dog

SIENNA
I see
(but she doesnt)
81 9-20-13

LANGDON
Its also water soluble

BACK AT THE FONT

Langdon shoves aside the hexagonal cover of the font exposing
the baptismal water below He dips the towel in the water starts
carefully wiping the back of the mask

The whitish surface of the mask wipes away neatly revealing
writing underneath Its ornate curving written in a careful
spiral pattern

Langdon starts to read as he wipes

LANGDON (contd)
O you possessed of sturdy
intellect observe the teachings
hidden here beneath the veil of
verses so obscuress

STENNA
Thats Dante

LANGDON
Very good Zobrist is challenging
us with Dantes own words

He keeps wiping keeps reading As the full spiral pattern
emerges he reads more

LANGDON (contd)
Seek the treacherous Doge of Venice
who severed the heads from horses

SIENNA
Venice

LANGDON
Kneel within the gilded museum of
holy wisdom and place thine ear to
the ground listening for the sounds
of trickling water

He looks up --
LANGDON (contd)
Venice is where Dante became infected

with the disease that killed him

-- and back down
82 9-20-13

LANGDON (contd)
Follow deep into the sunken palace
for here in the darkness the
chthonic monster waits --

SIENNA
The plague itself Underwater

LANGDON
Submerged in the blood-red waters
of the lagoon that reflects no stars

SIENNA
The blood-red waters Like in your
vision

LANGDON

How long is the train ride to Venice

SIENNA
Two hours

He starts out She stops him

SIENNA (contd)
Do you still have the phone I took

He digs in his pocket and hands it over thinking she intends to
dump it But instead she starts looking up a number

LANGDON
Who are you calling

SIENNA
Alitalia To buy us two plane tickets
to Geneva

LANGDON
You heard me say Venice right
SIENNA

INT FLORENCE AIRPORT DAY

Agent Bruder Dr Sinskey and several SRS agents hurry through
the terminal at the Venice airport The Agents have weapons drawn
and are flanked by LOCAL POLICE who SHOUT at everyone to get the
hell out of the way Theyre causing a mini-panic
83 9-20-13

They reach a gate where a terrified GATE AGENT throws her hands
in the air

DR SINSKEY
This is the flight to Geneva

GATE AGENT
Si But we just closed the doors

BRUDER
Bring the plane back to the gate at
once

A VOICE speaks up from behind him -- a very calm British voice

VOICE (0S)
That would be a waste of time

if hes been waiting here for them all along

SIMS
And we have very little of that

CUT TO
INT AIRPORT - SECURITY ROOM DAY

Sims Bruder and Sinskey sit at a table in an interrogation room
at the airport the kind of sterile place they take you if your
documents have been flagged

Sinskey is livid

SINSKEY
Youre telling me that for two years
you and your organization have been
working to thwart me at Bertram
Zobrists request

SIMS
That is correct

SINSKEY
To shield him and his research from
the World Health Organization

SIMS
Regrettably yes
84 9-20-13

SINSKEY
And that all of my attempts to prevent
him from committing mass murder on a
scale unprecedented in global history
have been unsuccessful -- because of
you

SIMS
An incisive sum-up

He checks his watch
SINSKEY

And now you have the temerity to ask
that I simply decide to trust you

SIMS
Terribly sorry dont see any other
way

SINSKEY

Why didnt you come to me sooner

SIMS
I clung to a hope that it could all
be kept quiet I wasnt aware what
was at stake until I saw the video

Bruder leans forward to Sims

BRUDER
Can you think of a single reason why
I shouldnt leave you face down in a
ditch somewhere

SIMS
It would curtail my joie de vie

SINSKEY
Who exactly does your group work
for

SIMS
We are stateless if thats what you
mean We work for our clients
Doctor we live in a complicated
world filled with shifting alliances
Why dont we behave in our mutual
best interests

SINSKEY
Why should I Why do I even need
you

CLOSE ON Robert Langdons hand as he rubs the space behind his
right ear just at the base of his skull This close in we can
see a tiny flesh-colored squaresthere just barely visible due

to its reflective metal surface So thats why his ear hurt

Langdon and Sienna are on board the train sitting across from
one another

SIENNA
The treacherous doge who can that
be

LANGDON

The doges were the kings of Venice
they were all treacherous

SIENNA
This one cut the heads off horses
Is there a famous story about that

LANGDON
I dont know

SIENNA
And the gilded museum what does
that refer to

LANGDON
St Marks maybe -- the Horses of
Constantinople -- bronze statues --
I dont know

SIENNA

Were their heads cut off
86 9-20-13

LANGDON
I dont know

Its the first time weve ever heard him snap

SIENNA
Sorry I was starting to get the
impression you knew everything
Professor

He rubs his head the strain and fatigue really getting to him

LANGDON
No Not nearly No
(to himself)
Some mysteries we werent meant to
solve

He turns looks across the aisle of the train at an ITALIAN WOMAN
in her forties

A MEMORY FLASH

and he sees a fleeting image of Dr Sinskey the woman by the
river of blood and shes reaching out to him very close now
reaching to him --

BACK IN REALITY

-- and then he blinks and the image is gone He puts his hand
over his eyes

SIENNA
Are you in pain

LANGDON
Im fine

SIENNA

I dont believe you

LANGDON
Something was And isnt anymore

He stops he wont say more She looks at him

SIENNA
When my relationship ended it was
sudden Hed been everything to me
My teacher my lover But he turned
out to have feet of clay

He rubs his head again in serious need of sleep
87 9-20-13

LANGDON
Every man is a myth Every woman a
dream

SIENNA
What is that

LANGDON
A song I cant remember None of
us live up to what others want us to
be

SIENNA
Im sorry that isnt good enough
for me

LANGDON
Then youd better get used to
disappointment

Now its her turn to shut off She looks out the window Langdon
does too

is still with them following at a discreet distance

He tips his hat down over his face and leans back in his seat

EXT VENICE - ST MARKS SQUARE DAY

A winged lion sits atop a column his paw resting proudly on a
book Moving down we see THRONGS OF TOURISTS mobbing St Marks
Square in Venice the waters of the Grand Canal visible behind
it

We come all the way down to find Langdon and Sienna standing
between the columns staring at the sea of humanity both thinking
the same thing

SIENNA
Twenty million people a year From
every corner of the globe

LANGDON
If you wanted to start a plague --

SIENNA
-- this is where Id do it
88 9-20-13

LANGDON
You know the word quarantine comes
from the Italian quaranta forty
During the Plague Venice enforced a
decree that said all ships had to
anchor in the harbor for forty days
before entering the city

She looks at him and cant help but smile
SIENNA
Nice to see you back Professor

The horses

LANGDON
Right there

He points across the square and we follow his indication to --
EXT ST MARKS BASILICA DAY

-- the top of the basilica where just below its ornate crested
peak four mammoth copper stallions glint in the afternoon sun

Langdon and Sienna rush out onto the terrace atop the Basilica
and stand beneath the massive statues looking up at them

SIENNA
Were on top of the basilica how
could we possibly hear water rushing
underneath these horses

LANGDON
These are replicas the real ones
are kept in a museum for preservation

He looks around sees a MUSEUM GUIDE speaking to a small group in
Italian Langdon turns to Sienna whos already moving forward

LANGDON (contd)

Ask him -- have the heads been cut
off these horses Is there history
behind it

She does and the Guide replies

SIENNA
He says there is such a story but
they dont like to speak of it

LANGDON
Ask harder
89 9-20-13

Sienna does The Guide replies Sienna translates while he talks

SIENNA
According to the tale the horses
were looted from Constantinople during
the Crusades But they were too
large to be loaded on board the ships
so their heads were removed and
reattached

LANGDON
By whom

She asks again The Guide replies

SIENNA
By Venices most clever and deceitful
doge The doge who tricked everyone
into the Crusades the one who took
state money to sailto Egypt but
redirected his troops and sacked
Constantinople instead A blind
man ninety years old

Langdons face pales The Guide continues talking and Sienna
continues translating but Langdon already knows where this is
going

SIENNA (contd)
The doge who lived forever Enrico --

LANGDON
(finishing with her)
-- Dandolo

Langdon staggers to the railing and grips it tightly Sienna
thanks the Guide and goes to him

SIENNA
What is it

LANGDON
Enrico Dandolo The gilded museum
of holy wisdom I made a mistake

SIENNA
Are we in the wrong basilica

He turns and looks at her

LANGDON
Were in the wrong country
90 9-20-13

Before she can react a SHOUT draws their attention from below
They peer over the railing

DOWN BELOW

an imposing group of BLACK-CLAD SOLDIERS has just entered the
church and is fanning out across the narthex blocking all the
exits

UP ABOVE

SIENNA
How did they find us

LANGDON
Doesnt matter Lets go

He turns and they run along the length of the balcony into the
setting sun which has sunk low over the western end of St Marks
Square

They rush along the front of the basilica and he leads her to the
left following the balcony around the southwest corner toward a
heavy door of wrought iron and glass They push through it

INT ST MARKS BASILICA DAY

They hurry back inside the basilica They skirt the perimeter of
the vast open space of the central nave From nearby they can
hear the SHOUTS of Soldiers

Langdon spots a fire alarm on the wall figures what the hell
yanks down hard on it --

-- and it SHATTERS in his hand Broken glass and plastic but no
alarms

LANGDON
It doesnt work

SIENNA
You are such an American

Behind them Soldiers enter the main room of the basilica Langdon
and Sienna take off again into an enclosed spiral stairway

INT STATRWELL DAY

They race down the steps of the stairwell and pause there two
floors down

Langdon turns and looks up He gets a glimpse of SOLDIERS BOOTS
on the main floor of the basilica
91 9-20-13

Sienna looks down More flights of spiral stairs leading to
darkness

LANGDON
(whispering)
Bad idea Subterranean crypt with

no exit
FOOTSTEPS start down the stairs above them

SIENNA
No choice

She starts down again Shes right so he follows

At the bottom of the stairs they pass a sign that says CRIPTA
DI SAN MARCO and continue on

INT SUBTERRANEAN SPACE DAY

They push through another door and come into a subterranean space --
not abandoned its a working chapel with an altar and folding
chairs set up in front of it But the place is dark its low

stone ceilings supported by ancient pillars and brick-vaulted
archways

SIENNA
I see natural light

She points to several small arched transoms high on the wall

LANGDON
Light wells

He races to the nearest one The light well from the plaza opens
into a deep shaft that drops down from St Marks Square above

The window glass is reinforced with interlocking iron circles
and is at shoulder height

Langdon goes to it turns a latch and opens the window He peers
up into it -- the square is ten feet above him at the top of the
shaft

He turns He has an idea

EXT ST MARKS SQUARE DAY

CLOSE ON a Venetian plague doctors mask the kind Langdon saw in
his vision Pulling back we see its one of many masks being

sold by a GYPSY WOMAN her stand in the shadow of the great
basilica in St Marks Square
92 9-20-13

She hears a SOUND near her feet and turns The sound is coming
from the bottom of the window well behind her at the base of the
wall of the chapel

She bends over staring down through the grate and into the ten
foot well

AT THE BASE OF THE WELL

she sees a chair shoved into view and then a MAN climbing on
top of it

Robert Langdon He looks up at the Gypsy Woman and puts a finger
to his lips -- Shhhhhhhh

Then he turns and gestures and Sienna climbs onto the chair and
onto his hands which he holds together to give her a boost

INSIDE THE WELL

with Langdons boost Sienna can just get her hands on the security
latch on the underside of the grate She FLICKS the latch and
pushes on the grate

IN THE SQUARE

the gate rises an inch or two but Sienna cant get it all the
way open

SIENNA
Puo darci una mano

The Gypsy Woman looks at her Then looks around Then looks
back to Sienna

GYPSY WOMAN
Cento euro

Sienna CURSES digs in her pocket and comes up with a bill She
hands it to the Gypsy Woman through the bars of the grate

INT SUBTERRANEAN SPACE DAY

led by Agent Bruder He sees Langdon across the room standing

on the chair in the window well

BRUDER

EXT ST MARKS SQUARE DAY

With a loud CLANG the Gypsy Woman tosses aside the grate and
pulls Sienna up through the opening

Sienna turns back drops to her stomach and reaches down for
Langdon to help him up

He gets hold of her hand and she pulls uses all her strength
she gets him a good foot or two off the chair

IN THE WELL

Langdons feet scrabble against the stone wall of the window well
he finds some small bit of purchase and gets even higher

Behind him the Soldiers race across the room now just a few
seconds from him

IN THE SQUARE

Langdons very close if she just helps him get a few inches
higher hell get his hands over the edge and can pull himself
out

But she is weakening and lowers him

SIENNA
I cant do it

LANGDON
You can Pull

SIENNA
Im sorry

He drops down a bit more She tries again but to no avail

SIENNA (contd)
Where do I go Robert Where is the
doge buried

Beneath Langdon Soldiers appear and SHOUT up at him He looks
at them then back up at Sienna

ROUGH HANDS grab hold of his legs and start pulling him back down
His fingers slip out of Siennas but not before he tells her one
last piece of information
94 9-20-13

LANGDON (contd)

Sienna immediately lets go of his hand she wrenches it away in
fact and Langdons eyes widen he has a sudden memory flash two
of them in fact --

IN THE BOBOLI GARDENS

Sienna looks right at Langdon

SIENNA
Robert the cause is saving the world

AND IN THE TRAIN COMPARTMENT
she sits in the seat across from him

(composing herself)
Hello Bertram
ZOBRIST
You have something of mine I would
like it back
SIENNA

to do

He makes a minute movement of his right arm revealing just the
tip of a barrel of a handgun pointed at her

ZOBRIST
That way

He gestures to a passageway nearby

She looks at the gun then up at him She complies moving around
a corner and into a little-used hallway

IN THE HALLWAY

they are alone for the moment

She looks at him He is determined and hes armed

SIENNA
I loved you very much

She reaches into her jacket pocket and pulls out an object that
looks like a small inhaler

He frowns That isnt the object he was looking for

ZOBRIST
What do you think that is going to
do
She raises it to her lips --
SIENNA

I think its going to kill you

Elizabeth Sinskey leans over him and speaks softly

DR SINSKEY

Langdon recognizes her as the Woman from his vision and all at
once the entire world seems to drop away from around Langdons
face the couch disappears the floor everything just vanishes --

LANGDON
I remember

bit by bit a memory returning

Theres a tree behind him then a building the light changes on
his face and now his face changes too its clean-shaven his
hair all in place --

EXT HARVARD QUAD DAY

-- and hes dressed in his familiar Harris Tweed jacket carrying
books and papers looking directly at someone as STUDENTS and
TEACHERS cross in the background behind him

wall where the Faraday pointer is showing the image of La Mappa
dellInferno that he saw earlier

Langdon stands close to it studying it fascinated Seeing it
of the first time Dr Sinskey is just behind him

LANGDON
Why would he send you this

SINSKEY
He wants me to see his ground zero
To bear witness to what hes done

night to a table in a darkened library

Langdon and Dr Sinskey are bent over a text of Dantes Inferno
searching for more clues Langdon is going on in a voice we
cant hear spilling information as fast as he can

Sinskey looks up interested in the man more than the message for
a moment he glances up too catches her eye and they both look
back down But it was a moment of contact The image jumps --

EXT STREET - FLORENCE NIGHT

-- and they are hurrying through the streets hands locked
together

Suddenly TWO CARS SCREECH to a halt in front of them cutting
them off Agent Bruder steps up trying to pull a weapon but
ARMED MEN SHOUT IN ITALIAN backing him off

Two of the Armed Men grab Langdon and drag him toward one of the
cars Dr Sinskey holds on for a moment --

-- but their hands are pulled apart Langdon looks back over
his shoulder he sees Dr Sinskey CALLING OUT to him --

DR SINSKEY
ROBERT
99 9-20-13

-- but hes shoved in the back of the car
INT CAR NIGHT

Langdon cranes around looks out the back window and sees Dr
Sinskey disappear into the distance

And in a swift sudden cut --
INT VENICE APARTMENT DAY

-- we go back to Langdons face in the present in the apartment
in Venice Its quiet again His memory mostly restored he
sits up looking directly at Dr Sinskey She returns his gaze
sympathy and softness in her eyes Langdon looks around the room
He sees Agent Bruder and then Harry Sims

LANGDON
(to Sims)
Who are you

SIMS
A facilitator

Sims steps forward reaches behind Langdons right ear and with
a little TEARING sound he pulls off the flesh-colored tracking
chip

Langdon looks at it surprised then up at Sims

LANGDON
I never had amnesia did I Not
truly

SIMS

No Your chemically induced memory
loss was a desperation move by me
and my organization

LANGDON
And Sienna Brooks isnt an ER
doctor She was Bertram Zobrists
lover and his student

Sims looks at the others then back at Langdon

SIMS
Highest marks Professor

LANGDON
Your turn
100 9-20-13

SIMS
For two years my organization has
prevented Dr Sinskey from locating
our client Dr Zobrist or
interfering with his research in any
way Needless to say we were unaware
of the true nature of his work
Until today

LANGDON
What about Sienna She was working
for you

SIMS

Dr Brooks approached us some time
ago She told us of a rift between
her and Zobrist that he broke off
from her when she expressed serious
concerns about his intentions She
didnt mention a phague but she

told us enough to alarm us We agreed
to work with her to find Zobrist

but had no success Then Dr Sinskey
brought you in

Dr Sinskey chimes in

SINSKEY
Robert you and I were close to
solving the puzzle Zobrist had left
and finding the location of his plague
before it was released But then --

She gestures to Sims

SIMS
Our agents kidnapped you and used
benzodiazapenes to clear your memory
so we could create a fresh scenario
whereby you would be invested in the
idea of helping us A small incision
was made to give you the impression
of a head wound Im told the scar
will be unremarkable

Langdon is aghast but Sims utterly unapologetic manner is
disarming

LANGDON
There are no door locks in hospital
rooms Its been bothering me
101 9-20-13

SIMS
As it should The room was a fake
LANGDON
What about the woman who shot Dr
Marconi
SIMS

The gun fired blanks the doctor was
an agent wearing a blood packet
Crude technique but effective enough
under the circumstances

LANGDON

Until Sienna changed your game
SIMS

Quite
LANGDON

She doesnt want to stop Zobrist

She is the dangerous zealot shes

the one even more fanatical than he

is She wants to make sure his plague

is released
Dr Sinskey sits next to him her tone urgent

DR SINSKEY
Then you must tell us at once
Professor Where are we going
CUT TO

INT PLANE DAY

On board a commercial flight Sienna makes her way down the aisle
to the bathroom at the front of the cabin

She steps inside --
INT PLANE - BATHROOM DAY
- and locks the door

She turns toward the mirror and removes her wig as she did when
we saw her take it off the first time

Again she is careful with it particularly when handling the
pony tail But this time we see why

She turns the wig over and undoes a small flap underneath the
scalp just above where the pony tail starts
102 9-20-13

There is a compartment there She slides her slender fingers
into the hollow space gets a hold of something and pulls it

out

Its a six inch tube translucent with a malevolent-looking
phosphorescent green substance inside

Sienna admires it She looks up into the mirror over the sink
Her eyes blaze

CUT TO
EXT ISTANBUL NIGHT
Night has fallen on the ancient Byzantine capital of Istanbul

Along the banks of the Sea of Marmara floodlights illuminate a
skyline of glistening mosques and slender minarets

EXT ATATURK AIRPORT NIGHT
A corporate jet taxis to a stop at a corner of the airfield

The door opens and Langdon Dr Sinskey Harry Sims and Agent
Bruder get off trailed by several SRS agents

They move quickly to several waiting cars
INT SEDAN NIGHT

Langdon and Dr Sinskey get into the back seat of one of the cars
the door SLAMS and they are moving immediately

Sinskey has an iPad open on her lap and is reading from it

LANGDON
Do you have any idea what it is
exactly I know were dealing with
a pathogen but --

SINSKEY
Harry Sims footage suggests its
biological rather than chemical
Whether its waterborne or airborne
were not sure Either is possible

LANGDON
And the underwater bag thats
containing it
103 9-20-13

SINSKEY
A substance called Solublon Designed
to dissolve in water over a period
of time and release the contents

LANGDON
How much time

SINSKEY
Less than wed like Im sure
(reading from the iPad)
It says here the Hagia Sophias lower
levels are flooded That could be
it

He nods looks out the window He thinks a moment then looks
back at her

LANGDON
The time that I lost The forty-
eight hours I was with you

SINSKEY
Well go first to Dandolos tomb

LANGDON
I have a feeling Ive lost something
I would have preferred to remember

She keeps her eyes on the iPad

SINSKEY
With luck the sound of water should
lead us from there

LANGDON
Did you hear what I-

SINSKEY
I heard

Finally she looks up at him and takes off her glasses

LANGDON
Am I right

SINSKEY
You are But Im afraid now that
moment is gone and this one is upon
us

She puts her glasses back on and goes back to her research on
the iPad
104 9-20-13

SINSKEY (contd)
You are like no one Ive ever met
Robert

And that apparently is all that will be said on the matter
CUT TO
EXT HAGIA SOPHIA NIGHT

The cars pull to a stop in front of the Hagia Sophia not so much

a building as a mountain The colossal silhouette appears to be

a city unto itself -- its massive central dome stands atop a number
of smaller domes and four towering minarets rise from the corners
of the building

The sedans SCREECH to a stop in front of the building Langdon
and Dr Sinskey get out of the first car Harry Sims and Agent
Bruder get out of the next

BRUDER
Good God were going to be
searching that

There are several more cars arriving too -- two more SRS vans
from the WHO and a number of Turkish police cars Word is
spreading and panic is on the rise

They march toward the building which only seems to get bigger as
they approach

Dr Sinskey talks to Langdon as they walk never taking her eyes
off the building

DR SINSKEY
Istanbul is where east meets west
During the Black Death they had
another name for it The hub of
the plague

They walk faster Up ahead an anxious-looking MAN IN WHITE waits
for them He strides forward to greet them holding out his
hand in great excitement

MIRSAT
Professor Langdon my name is Mirsat
I am the curator here It is an
honor to meet you

LANGDON
The honor is mine Mirsat

They dont stop walking so Mirsat falls into stride with them
105 9-20-13

DR SINSKEY
We appreciate your willingness to
take us inside after hours I can
assure you its of the utmost
importance
MIRSAT
It is not a problem for such honored
guests
INT HAGIA SOPHIA DAY
Were moving fast toward a giant bronze-plated portal -- the

Imperial Doorway Mirsat is talking excitedly as he leads them
toward the doors

MIRSAT
In Byzantine times the Imperial
Doorway was reserved for the sole
use of the emperors Tourists arent
usually allowed through it but in
honor of our special guests --

He gestures and TWO GUARDS begin to haul open the enormous doors

MIRSAT (contd)
Allow me to present --

The door opens and they step inside --
-- A COLOSSAL SANCTUARY

MIRSAT
-- the eighth wonder of the world

The room is so vast it dwarfs any cathedral we have ever seen
before Its golden dome towers 150 feet over the floor and forty
ribs radiate outward from its central point to a circular arcade
of forty arched windows

Agent Bruder is staggered

BRUDER
Jesus

MIRSAT
Yes and Allah and Muhammad too

He gestures to the main altar where a towering mosaic of Jesus
is flanked by two massive discs bearing the Arabic names of
Muhammad and Allah in ornate calligraphy
106 9-20-13

MIRSAT (contd)

May I ask is there anywhere in
particular you wish to begin your

tour

LANGDON
We want to see the tomb of Enrico
Dandolo

MIRSAT
Dandolo But his tomb is so very
plain

DR SINSKEY
It is an emergency that involves the
World Health Organization
Mirsat stops and looks at her

MIRSAT
But hes already dead

LANGDON
Mirsat Please

Mirsat gestures and leads on
INT HAGIA SOPHIA - DANDOLOS TOMB NIGHT
An inscription carved in stone

HENRICUS DANDOLO

Two palms place themselves flat on the stone and Langdons face
lowers slowly into frame He MURMURS to himself

LANGDON
Kneel within the gilded museum of
holy wisdom and place thine ear to
the ground --

He turns his head to the right and gently places his left ear to
the tomb the stone cold on his flesh

LANGDON (contd)
Listening for the sounds of trickling
water -- follow deep into the sunken
palace

He listens
107 9-20-13

LANGDON (contd)
I can hear water flowing somewhere
under the stone Where does it go

Mirsat looks at Langdon like hes crazy

MIRSAT
Its just drainage It goes to the
city cistern

Harry Sims speaks up

SIMS
Were looking for a large underground
space perhaps with columns
artificially lit from within

MIRSAT
Yes thats it The ancient cistern
Quite impressive actually it was
built in the sixth century its
called Yerebatan Sarayi

Langdon stiffens he knows enough Turkish to know those words

LANGDON
The sunken palace

BRUDER
Take us there

CUT TO
EXT STREET - ISTANBUL NIGHT

Mirsat leads Langdon and the others through a narrow street behind
the Hagia Sophia Bruder is on his cell phone talking fast

BRUDER
Im going to need schematics of all
conduits in and out of the cistern
Run full isolation and containment
protocols Well need physical and
chemical barriers along with vacuum --

They round a corner --

EXT CISTERN - ISTANBUL NIGHT

-- and come to a squat red-and-white brick building that has a
single door open revealing what looks to be a stairwell A crowd

of WELL-DRESSED PEOPLE wait in line while a DOORMAN controls the
flow of guests who are descending the stairs
108 9-20-13

Mirsat leads Langdon and the others to the entrance at a run

BRUDER
This is it The citys water supply

MIRSAT
No not anymore Its ancient
Weve modernized

LANGDON
But there is water down there

MIRSAT
Yes It just sits there and

eventually it filters down into the
earth

Dr Sinskey sees the well-dressed crowd doesnt understand

SINSKEY
What are these people doing here

MIRSAT
Its a tourist attraction

LANGDON
(with horror)
A tourist attraction

MIRSAT
I believe a concert series this week
The acoustics are excellent Rather
stuffy and humid down there but
still draws quite a crowd

Sinskey and Bruder look at each other

DR SINSKEY
He created a bioaerosol

LANGDON
Meaning

BRUDER
It can go airborne

DR SINSKEY
If its airborne its viral

Harry Sims has stopped next to a placard advertising the concert
series
109 9-20-13

SIMS
Weve found the right place

They turn and look and we move in fast on the poster Tonights
concert

Franz Liszt
THE DANTE SYMPHONY

CUT TO
INT CITY CISTERN NIGHT

Langdon and the others race down the stairs and into the cisterns
lower depths bumping against the crowd of CONCERT-GOERS who are
already streaming in ahead of them

LANGDON
Should we be wearing masks

DR SINSKEY
If its airborne the whole city may
already be infected Us included

BRUDER
And if it isnt we can stop it

They reach a series of catwalks at the bottom that crisscross and
press on arriving in the subterranean cavern itself The CONCERT
is an ongoing event and the whole place resonates with the wail
of VOICES the pinch of STRINGS and the deep roll of a TIMPANI
which thunders through the grotto

Langdon looks out over the glassy sheet of dark smooth water
that makes up the floor of the place

Rising out of the water in seemingly endless rows are hundreds of
thick Doric columns each climbing thirty feet to support the
caverns vaulted ceiling Theyre lit from below by a series of
individual red spotlights

LANGDON
Blood-red waters The lagoon that
reflects no stars

He looks to the left The concert itself is taking place against
a back wall of the cavern HUNDREDS OF SPECTATORS seated on an
expanse of platforms

BRUDER
Lights
110 9-20-13

TWO AGENTS step up with a half dozen bright halogen lights they
are passed out to the group and switched on

BRUDER (contd)
Spread out The light will reflect
off the bag in the water if you see
it

They start moving to the right at a jog each shining their lights
in the clear waters searching

The catwalks fork off in several directions and soon they have
divided up some space between them but still in shouting
distance

UP AHEAD

Langdon is studying the walls searching for some kind of clue
that will guide him in the cavernous space

His light falls across a sign on one of the walls and he stops in
his tracks looking at it It has an arrow pointing to the right
and a single word on it -- MEDUSA

LANGDON
Here This way

Bruder and the others come at a run

LANGDON (contd)
Medusa

DR SINSKEY
The Greek spirit Why

LANGDON
She was from a specific category of
Greek spirits Chthonic monsters

Thats enough for Sinskey They all take off at a run in that
direction Harry Sims is impressed

SIMS
So it is a word then

And he follows them
INT CISTERN - MEDUSA STATUE NIGHT

Up ahead a carved marble block rises out of the water -- the
head of Medusa her hair writhing with snakes
111 9-20-13

Langdon and the others arrive breathless Langdon squints through
the reddish haze that surrounds Medusas serpent-infested hair
Half of her is submerged but her eyes are revealed staring out
across the waters of the lagoon

DR SINSKEY
This is it

LANGDON
I think so

Harry Sims arrives pointing down at the water
SIMS
Its this area definitely The
color the columns its all just as

in the video

Agent Bruder slides beneath the railing and drops into the chest-
deep water

The other TWO AGENTS with him do the same and they fan out their
lights piercing the water as they search for the sunken bag

Dr Sinskey turns to Langdon and Sims

DR SINSKEY
You two spread out Use the lights

The catwalks go off in the three different directions surrounding
the Medusa and moving on beyond her so each of them goes their
own way

WITH LANGDON

he moves around the catwalk to the back side of the Medusa statue
Its darker on this side much darker and he is alone now moving

further away from the others

Langdon creeps along the distant strains of the CONCERT playing
a foreboding tune

Langdon walks carefully shining the light this way and that in
the water searching his light bouncing crazily off the floor of
the cistern --

-- and then off the walls --

-- past a figure in an alcove --

-- and then back off the surface of the water

Langdon freezes He saw something and so did we
112 9-20-13

He moves his light up off the water slowly shining it back on
the alcove

There is a figure there shrouded in dark shadows Its a person
huddled in a black burka head bowed

But as the figure feels the light on it the head starts to rise
and now two eyes materialize staring out through the narrow slit
of the burkas face covering locking intently on Langdon

Two hands reach up and push back the hood
Its Sienna

SIENNA
Youre too late Robert

LANGDON
I dont think I am What is in the
bag in the water

She takes a step forward onto the catwalk that divides them

SIENNA
Its a viral vector It will modify
the DNA of one in every three people
it infects

LANGDON
Modify it to do what

SIENNA
Its a sterility plague Robert It
will render one-third of the planet
infertile

LANGDON
Thats monstrous

SIENNA
Its cowardly But when combined
with this --

She raises one hand revealing something she holds in her right
hand - its the six inch tube we saw on the airplane the one
filled with the green phosphorescent liquid

SIENNA (contd)
-- its the solution

She holds it out over the water
113 9-20-13

LANGDON
Sienna

SIENNA
Answer the hypothetical question
Robert Would you kill half the
world in order to save it

LANGDON
Youre a physician Youve dedicated
your entire life to saving lives

SIENNA
And Ill go down in history as the
woman who saved the entire race

LANGDON
This isnt heroic Its playing
God

She takes another step forward her anger and intensity building
fanaticism in her eyes

SIENNA
In desperate times there is no
greater sin than inaction The
darkest places in hell have been
reserved for those who maintain their
neutrality in-

She suddenly GASPS and we cant imagine why until we move around
her into profile and see that --

-- Harry Sims stands behind her his right hand up at the base of
her skull

He pulls his hand back revealing the rapier-thin stiletto with
which he has just stabbed her its blade shining red with blood
in the flickering light

Sienna drops to the floorboards dead

Sims is now directly facing Langdon from just a few feet away
as he wipes the blade off on a handkerchief --

SIMS
Terribly sorry Didnt see any other
way

-- and slides it back into his wrist sheath with a satisfying
leathery SCRAPE

ON THE CATWALK
114 9-20-13

Siennas dead hand opens releasing her grip on the vile vial
The tube rolls down the catwalk headed for the water it just
tips over the edge --
-- and Langdon catches it

He looks up at Sims

SIMS (contd)
Well done you

INT CISTERN - WITH BRUDER NIGHT

Nearby in the cistern Agent Bruder is still up to his chest in
the harshly lit red waters

Hes stopped staring at something at his feet his light trained
on it

BRUDER
God in heaven

We follow his line of vision down to the surface of the water
where his light plays and we keep moving into the water --

UNDER THE WATER
and on down to where we can see the plaque on the floor of the
cistern the same plaque we saw in Zobrists video back in Harry

Sims office

The tether line rises up from the plaque and at the end of the
tether where the Solublon bag once floated --

-- there are only shreds

The shreds move as a hand closes around them raises them up out
of the water

BACK ABOVE THE SURFACE
Agent Bruder holds them up to the light staring at them aghast
He raises a cell phone to his ear

BRUDER (contd)
Containment has failed

A VOICE comes back at him over the line

VOICE (0S)
Say again
115 9-20-13

BRUDER
The virus has been released

CUT TO
EXT CISTERN NIGHT

A short time later and the street outside the city cistern is
now jammed with every kind of official vehicle and OFFICER we can
imagine There are LOCAL POLICE INTERPOL the WHO teams of
emergency responders in hazmat suits -- its a mess

The Concert-Goers are being evacuated as quickly as possible and
there is much confusion and concern

Nearby Harry Sims stands with Langdon Dr Sinskey and Agent
Bruder Dr Sinskey is talking with a LOCAL OFFICIAL through a
TRANSLATOR Bruder is on his cell phone arguing for something

LANGDON
When did the bag rupture

BRUDER
(into phone)
Yes Get him back I1l hold
(covering the phone)
A while ago Five days maybe six

Dr Sinskey turns to the others from the official shes been
speaking with

DR SINSKEY
He says the concert series has been
going on for a week Tens of
thousands of people have been through
here from all over the world

She and Langdon look around at the dispersing crowd

LANGDON
Istanbul The hub of the plague

SIMS
So the date Zobrist put on the plaque --
todays date --

DR SINSKEY
Wasnt the day he meant to release
it It was the global saturation
date A mathematical projection of
the date after which his virus will
have propagated across the world and
infected every individual
116 9-20-13

SIMS
We cant possibly know for sure that-

Bruder finishes his phone call hangs up and turns to the others

BRUDER
That was a friend of mine whos a
top virologist at the CDC in Atlanta
Hes just confirmed the presence of
an extremely contagious and never-
before-seen pathogen

DR SINSKEY
How did you get him a sample so fast

BRUDER
He tested his own blood Elizabeth
Its global

No one has a response to that They watch as two ECDC WORKERS
in hazmat suits come out of the cistern carrying Siennas
phosphorescent green tube in a pair of tongs between them

It is placed in a foam-lined crate marked with every imaginable
biohazard symbol and sealed and locked

Dr Sinskey looks back at Langdon

DR SINSKEY
It appears we have saved the world
from a deadly plague But what kind
of world is it now

CUT TO

EXT AIRFIELD DAWN

As the sun rises over Istanbul Sims Bruder Sinskey and Langdon
walk toward a pair of private jets their engines just warming up
in the distance

LANGDON
Where will you go

DR SINSKEY
Back to Geneva If Zobrists mutation
indeed works then we have to get
started on a cure immediately

LANGDON
How will you do that
117 9-20-13

DR SINSKEY
Generate another gene-mutating virus
if possible We will get the worlds
best minds to work and correct this

Harry Sims stops

SIMS
I wonder

The others stop too looking at him He doesnt want to continue

SIMS (contd)
Youll think me appalling

BRUDER
I already think it Go on

SIMS

If this is all true it means one-
third of the world can never
reproduce It also means the earths
nightmarish population problem has
been solved Even if we can put
things back the way they were --

(the tiniest shrug)
Should we

They just stare at him for a moment Only Langdon manages a
response

LANGDON
You are selling humanity short sir
We figure out our problems we solve
the puzzles life presents us with
and we do it with the greatness of
our collective mind We always have
Any other way -- is inhumane

Sims smiles and manages a tiny little bow of his head unfailingly
polite

SIMS
As I say Appalling

With a little wave he turns and heads off toward his jet alone
Agent Bruder looks at Langdon and Dr Sinskey
BRUDER
(to Langdon)

It was an honor Professor
(MORE )
118 9-20-13

BRUDER (contd)
(to Sinskey)

Doctor

He turns toward the plane clearly waiting for her The turbines
start to spin louder

Langdon and Dr Sinskey look at each other

LANGDON
Youll be in Geneva then

DR SINSKEY
Yes And youll return to Cambridge

He nods She reaches out a hand to shake He takes it

They hold on for a moment looking into each others eyes and
then she takes a step back from him slowly pulling her fingers
from his

They maintain contact as long as they possibly can --

-- and then they part She walks to the plane head down hands
deep in the pockets of her overcoat

Langdon watches her go

CUT TO
INT MUSEUM DAY
CLOSE ON the death mask of Dante Once again it resides in its
glass case in the Palazzo Vecchio Its early there arent many
people in the museum yet

NEARBY

Robert Langdon approaches a MUSEUM GUARD

LANGDON

Scusati do you speak English
GUARD

Yes
LANGDON

Have you seen Marta the guard whos
usually in this gallery

GUARD
Marta isnt here just now Shes
had her baby
119 9-20-13

LANGDON
Her baby Thats wonderful news
Im very happy for her

Langdon turns to go then turns back with a thought

LANGDON (contd)
Oh and you might also tell someone
the lights over the Dante mask need
to be turned on You can barely see
it

GUARD
Im sorry sir the Dante mask is no
longer here It was stolen

LANGDON
Really I was just looking at it

He turns and walks away leaving»it at that Behind him the
Guard looks puzzled

Staying with Langdon we see the Guard run over to the glass case
in the background He sees the mask and starts SHOUTING to anyone
who will listen BLOWING his whistle making a happy ruckus

Robert Langdon smiles
CUT TO
INT LANGDONS APARTMENT NIGHT

A cardboard box has a return address in Geneva A scissors comes
into frame and slices open the flaps

Langdon is back in his apartment in Cambridge seated in his
favorite chair There is a glass of scotch on the table beside
him and an open book on the table beside it

The box is on the ottoman in front of him Inside theres a
handwritten letter on top of some clothing

Langdon unfolds the letter Dr Sinskeys VOICE comes over as he
reads it

DR SINSKEY (VO)
Dear Robert it appears our moment
together will remain just that
Only a moment a stolen one before
life tore us apart like Dante and
Beatrice
120 9-20-13

Langdon sets aside the letter and starts going through the contents
of the box

His jacket the Harris Tweed that he loved so much is there as
are his pants and shoes He smiles How thoughtful Dr
Sinskeys voice continues

DR SINSKEY (VO) (contd)
I had long ago accustomed myself to
walking alone through this life

But there is one more thing in the box At the bottom wrapped
in bubble wrap is Langdons Mickey Mouse watch

Langdon is delighted to see it again He sets aside the box
holding onto the watch

DR SINSKEY (VO) (contd)
And in this overcrowded world perhaps
it is not such a bad thing to be
alone
Langdon straps the watch to his wrist
DR SINSKEY (VO) (contd)
I only wish you remembered our brief
time together as well as I do But
life must have its mysteries
He picks up the letter tucks it inside the book he was reading --

DR SINSKEY (VO) (contd)
Even for you Professor Langdon

-- and closes it
Hell try not to think of her again But he will fail

FADE OUT
