a Screenplay
by
James Cameron
and

William Wisher

Revised final shooting script

1 EXT CITY STREET - DAY

Downtown LA Noon on a hot summer day On an EXTREME LONG
LENS the

lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity In SLOW
MOTION

they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed
bumper to

bumper Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces The image

is
surreal dreamy and like a dream it begins very slowly to
DISSOLVE TO
2 EXT CITY RUINS - NIGHT
Same spot as the last shot but now it is a landscape in Hell
The
cars are stopped in rusted rows still bumper to bumper The
skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some
unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles
Wind blows through the desolation keening with the sound of
ten
million dead souls It scurries the ashes into drifts stark
white in the moonlight against the charred rubble
A TITLE CARD FADES IN
LOS ANGELES July 11 2029
3 ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones Beyond the

mound is a
vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete The rush hour
crowd
burned down in their tracks

4 WE DISSOLVE TO a playground where intense heat has half-
melted the

jungle gym the blast has warped the swing set the merry-go-
round

has sagged in the firestorm Small skulls look accusingly
from the

ash-drifts WE HEAR the distant echo of childrens voices
playing

and laughing in the sun A silly sing-songy rhyme as WE
TRACKS

SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of
hopscotch

lines are still visible

CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle next to
the
tiny skull of its owner HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE
speaks
VOICE
3 billion human lives ended on August 29th 1997
The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war
Judgment Day They lived only to face a new
nightmare the war against the Machines
A metal foot crushes the skull like china
TILT UP revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle
rifle
It looks like a CHROME SKELETON a high-tech Death figure
It is
the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator Its glowing red
eyes

compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain hunting

The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES Searchlights blaze down as a

formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes

overhead PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon beyond
which we

see flashes and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle
in

progress

5 EXT BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

THE BATTLE Human troops is desperate combat with the
machines for

possession of the dead Earth The humans are a ragtag
guerrilla

army Skynets weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot
gun-platforms) flying Aerial HKs four-legged gun-pods called
Centurions and the humanoid terminators in various forms

SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS

5A Explosions Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light
5B A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at
a

pursuing Aerial HK bringing it down in a fiery explosion
5C Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground
HK
5D A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator
5E endoskeletons in the ruins of a building Three terminator
5F endoskeletons advance firing rapidly Another (complete
cyborg)

with flesh ripped open and back broken gropes for a rifle on
the

ground
5G A Centurion overruns a human firing position Soldiers are
cut

down as they run Fiery explosions light the ranks of
advancing

machines
6 IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle a man
watches

the combat with night-vision binoculars He wears the uniform
ofa

guerrilla general and a black beret He is still amid
running

shouting techs and officers

CU MAN pushing slowly in as the battle rages 0S He
lowers the

binoculars He is forty-five years old Features severe
The left

side of his face is heavily scarred A patch covers that eye
An

impressive man forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war
The name

stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR We push in until
his

eyes fill frame then

DISSOLVE TO
FIRE SLOW BOILING ENORMOUS FILLING FRAME
VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)

Skynet the computer which controlled the machines
sent two terminators back through time Their
mission to destroy the leader of the human
Resistance John Connor My son

The first terminator was programmed to strike at
me in the year 1984 before John was born
It failed

The second was set to strike at John himself
when he was still a child As before the
Resistance was able to send a lone warrior A
protector for John It was just a question of
which one of them would reach him first

DISSOLVE TO
7 EXT TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT

Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel
canyon

formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS parked side by side in the
back lot

of an all-night truck stop Then

The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air and
in

the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF
ENERGY

Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP

Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly a
naked man
TERMINATOR has come through Physique massive perfect

Face

devoid of emotion Terminator stands and impassively surveys
its

surroundings
8 INT TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT

On a back route to north LA A handful of local TRUCKERS
hunch over

chili-sizes CAT hats pushed back on their heads Three
BIKERS are

playing a game of pool in the back their Miller empties

lining the
tables rail The dives owner LLOYD a fat aging biker-
type ina

soiled apron stands behind the bar Nothing much going on

Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in --
that
doesnt happen every night All eyes simultaneously swivel

toward

Terminator Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as
it

walks calmly through the room Everyone frozen not sure how
to

react
8A TERMINATOR POV A digitized electronic scan of the room
overlaid

with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human
eye

can follow In POV we move past the staring truckers past
the

owner and the awestruck WAITRESS and approach a large nasty-
looking

biker puffing on a cigar His body is outlined or
selected and
thousands of estimated measurements appear His clothing has

been
analyzed and deemed suitable
8B TERMINATOR
I need your clothes your boots and your
motorcycle
The big bikers eyes narrow He takes a long draw on this
cigar
the tip cherry-red hot
CIGAR BIKER
You forgot to say please
He grinds the cigar out on Terminators chest Which produces
not
the slight reaction of pain Terminator calmly and without
expression grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm
Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip
Terminator doesnt see Cigars friend behind him holding his
pool
cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger The heavy
send
whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back
of

Terminators head

Terminator seems not to notice Doesnt even blink Without

releasing his grip on Cigar he snaps his arm straight back
and grabs

Pool Cue by the front of his jacket Suddenly the heavyset
biker
finds himself flying through the nearest window CRAASSH

Terminator hurls Cigar all 230 pounds of him clear over the

bar

through the serving window into the kitchen where he lands on
the

big flat GRILL We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar

screams flopping jerking He rolls off in a smoking heap

The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and
slashes

at Terminators face

Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand Holding
it by

the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guys hand

Ultra-fast here He flips it Grabs the handle like youre
supposed

to hold a knife Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over
the

bar Then brings the knife whistling down pinning the
bikers

shoulder to the bar top with his own steel
9 INT KITCHEN

The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in

The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward
Cigar

who is cursing in pain on the floor

With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the 45
auto

tucked under his leather jacket But he cant even hold onto
it

Terminator takes it from him Instead of pointing it at him

Terminator carefully examines weapon analyzing its caliber
and

operating condition Terminator never threatens thats a
human

thing He just takes

Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come
back to

him He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to

Terminators

black

foot Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket
INT TRUCK STOP

Terminator strides from the kitchen fully clothed now in a
He
Without

the

Lloyd
sit

finally

door

the 45
GLIDE

Kicks

leather jacket leather riding pants and heavy clean boots
moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table
slowing his stride he jerks the knife out The guy slumps to
floor groaning behind him

Terminator continues toward the front of the diner passing
the owner At the door he comes abreast of two truckers who
frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite One of the truckers
nods

TRUCKER
Evening

Terminator impassively stares back Then moves on out the

EXT TRUCK STOP

Terminator walks out surveying the parked Harleys Sticks
in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-
He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition

over the engine It catches with a roar and he slams the

heavy iron

jacks

shifter

leg

the

into gear with a KLUNK

Lloyd appears at the diners door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE
WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN He fires into the air and

around round in fast aiming at Terminators back
LLOYD
I cant let you take the mans wheels son
Now get off or Ill put you down
Terminator turns and considers by coldly He eases the
up
into neutral Rocks the bike onto its kickstand Swings him

over and walks calmly toward the guy

Terminator strides right up to Lloyd staring straight into
shotguns muzzle Lloyd starts sweating trying to decide is
hes

going to kill a man in cold blood Hes still trying to
decide when

Terminators hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is

somehow

suddenly holding the shotgun

Lloyd gapes knowing hes screwed Then

Terminator reaches toward him Oh shit

And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyds shirt pocket Puts
them on

Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of
gravel
12 EXT FREEWAY - NIGHT

Terminator roars down the freeway heading for LA Cold neon
flares

across the chrome of the big bike The 10-gauge is jammed
through

the clutch and brake cables across the handlebars The
lights flow

over Terminators wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of
tracer

rounds

CUT TO
13 EXT OVERPASS - NIGHT
The First Street Bridge Rusting chain-link fence and

graffiti-
covered walls An LAPD BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty

street

A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the
columns

of the overpass The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his
head

around at the source of the light He pulls over quickly in
time

to see
13A The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak
between

the columns Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light

standards lighting up the night and papers swirl ina
blasting

whirlwind

13B The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades
He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he
saw the

strange light He draws his revolver and cautiously moves
into the

shadows between the rows of pillars

A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop
Nothing

special about him Certainly not built like a terminator
The flash

of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that
he

just arrived from the future His features are handsome
bordering

on severe His eyes are gray ice Penetrating Intelligent

THE COP spins at a sound Too late Mr X is already on him
The
blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand

LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck his BERETTA
9mm

AUTOMATIC clattering next to him A hand ENTERS FRAME and
picks up

this pistol

CUT TO

13C HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK SHOES rounding the rear tire of the
police

cruiser FOLLOW THE SHOES to the cruisers door then MOVE UP
as

Mr X dressed now in LAPD blue climbs behind the wheel He

looks and acts exactly like a cop Cool alert confident in
his

power his expression emotionless and judgmental

Mr X now Officer X puts the car in gear and drives into the
night

CUT TO

14 INT SUBURBAN HOUSEGARAGE - DAY

TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN CONNOR who at his moment is ten years old
and

busy reassembling the carburetor on his Honda 125 dirtbike
He has

ripped Levis and long stringy hair A sullen mouth Eyes
which

reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel The Ramones I
Wanna

Be Sedated blasts from a boom box next to him
A WOMAN JANELLA VOIGHT stands in the doorway of the garage
yelling over the music

WOMAN

clean up that pigsty of yours

Johns friend TIM a thirteen-year-old Hispanic kid watches

as John
replies by turning up the volume on the boom box

He sighs Throws down the TVs remote and heads for the
garage
16 INT GARAGE
John hops on the bike Kick-starts it Tim picks up Johns
nylon

bag then climbs on the back Todd ENTERS and shouts over the
engine which John revs louder and louder

TODD
John Get your ass inside right now and do
what your mother says

John pins Todd with a defiant glare

JOHN
Shes not my mother Todd
He revs the engine and peels out of the garage with Tim
almost
falling off the back They take off down the street

17 EXT VACANT LOTDRAINAGE CANAL

John cuts through a vacant lot to a trail running beside a
fenced-in

drainage canal He guns the bike through a hole in the
retaining

fence Tims eyes go wide as they roar down the concrete
embankment

17A IN THE DRAINAGE CANAL John zig-zags along throwing up a
roostertail of muddy water Tim shouts pretending he didnt
just
see his life flash before his eyes He slaps John on the
back
TIM
Major moves homes So where is your
real mom anyway
(John doesnt answer)
She dead or something
Its hard to read Johns expression
JOHN
She might as well be
John twists the throttle angrily and the bike lunges forward
CUT TO
18 EXT PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL - DAY
A SIGN on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire
reads

PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE Beyond it

squats an imposing four-story building Institutional brick

Barred windows About as inviting as KGB headquarters
Security

guards patrol the manicured grass

19 INT HOSPITAL - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING

Sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall
The room

is empty of all furnishings save the bed a stainless steel
sink
toilet and a dented metal mirror WE HEAR a rhythmic
grunting
small explosions of breath in perfectly-metered time

PAN TO a bedframe leaned upright against the wall legs facing

outward A pair of sweaty hands grip one leg Tendons knot
and

release as SOMEONE does pull-ups A man of tangled hair hides
the

face that comes INTO FRAME dips out comes back

WIDER A WOMAN in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging
from the
top leg of the vertical bedframe Her body is straight and

taut

Knees bent so the feet clear the ground The arms are lean
and

muscular The inmate face hidden pulls up dips pulls up
Like

a machine No change in rhythm
20 INT HOSPITALCORRIDOR

FIGURES MOVE TOWARD US down a corridor of polished tile and
two-

tone walls DR PETER SILBERMAN a smug criminal
psychologist

leads a group of young INTERNS Following laconically are
THREE

BURLY ATTENDANTS

SILBERMAN
The next patient is a 29-year old female
diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder
The usual indicators depression anxiety
violent acting-out delusions of persecution
(the interns nod judiciously)
Here we are

Silberman stops at one of the SOUNDPROOF STEEL DOORS There
is a two-

way speaker beneath a tiny window Silberman flips the
intercom

switch

21 INT CELL

Silbermans scrubbed and cheerful face at cell window HIS
VOICE
comes over the tinny speaker

SILBERMAN
Morning Sarah

REVERSE ANGLE as she turns slowly into CLOSE UP

SARAH CONNOR is not the same woman we remember from last time
Her

eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a
cornered

animal Defiant and intense but skittering around looking

for
escape at the same time Fight or flight Down one cheek is
a long
scar from just below the eye to her upper lip
Her VOICE is a low and chilling monotone
SARAH
Good morning Dr Silberman Hows the knee
22 INT CORRIDOR
Silbermans smug composure drops a second Then returns
SILBERMAN
Fine Sarah
(he switches off speaks to
the interns)
She uh stabbed me in the kneecap with a
screwdriver a few weeks ago
Sarah watches them talking about her through the glass but
cant
hear them She feels like a lab animal The interns look in
at her
through the glass as Silberman talks With her face drawn
eyes
haggard and hair wild she looks like she belongs where she
is
SILBERMAN
The delusional architecture is interesting
She believes a machine called a terminator
which looks human of course was sent back
though time to kill her And also that the
father of her child was a soldier sent to
protect her he was from the future too
(he smiles)
The year 2029 if I remember correctly
(the interns chuckle)
Lets move on shall we
As the interns walk on Silberman steps close to DOUGLAS the
head

attendant and speaks low
SILBERMAN
Douglas I dont like seeing the patients
disturbing their rooms like this See that she
takes her thorazine would you

DOUGLAS is 64 250 pounds and warm-hearted at a rattlesnake

He
nods catching Silbermans meaning and gestures for the other
attendants to hang back as Silberman moves on in his rounds
23 INT CELL
Sarah looks up as the cell door opens Douglas walks in
slowly
idly tapping his POLICE BATON against the door in a ominous
rhythm
The other two orderlies ease in behind him One of them
carries a
STUN BATON (like a sawed-off cattle prod) The other has a
tray with
cups of red liquid-thorazine
DOUGLAS
Time to take you meds Connor
Sarah faces him weight centered Feral eyes darting from one
to the
other
SARAH
You take it
Douglas grins casual --
DOUGLAS
Now you know you got to be good cause you up
for review this afternoon
SARAH
Im not taking it Now I dont want any
trouble
DOUGLAS
Aint no trouble at all --
He whips the baton in a whistling backhand which --
WHAP Takes her square in the stomach She doubles over and
drops

slams

to her knees unable to breathe Douglas tips the bed and it
from

rise

Holds

PIN
Ready-
then

his

down with a crash right new to her He takes her stun wand
the other attendant and walks forward
TIGHT ON SARAH grimacing and struggling to breathe

SARAH
You son of a AAARRGH

The stun wand hits her between shoulder blades as she tries to
It drives her to the floor pinning her like a bug Little
ELECTRIC ARCS CRACKLE as the baton makes her writhe in pain
Douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees

the cup of thorazine in front of her lips

DOUGLAS
Last call sugar

Gasping she chokes the zombie juice down

CUT TO
EXT BANK PARKING LOT - DAY
John furtively hunches before a Ready-Teller machine at the
a local bank while his friend Tim stands lookout John slips
stolen ATM card into the machine slot It is something hes
up because trailing from the card is ribbon-wire which goes
some kind of black-box electronics unit hes got in his ever-
knapsack He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a
little lap-top keyboard which is also connected to the black-
John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the
number for that account He quickly enters the number on the
Tellers keypad and asks it for 300 bucks The machine whirs
begins dispensing twenty-dollar bills Tim looks back over

He gives her a gentle smile
REESE
I know This is a dream Sarah
SARAH
Oh Yeah They make me take this stuff
He puts a finger to her lips Then silently unfastens her
restraints
They gaze into each others eyes And in the look that his
death
and the horror she has been through since hasnt touched their
love
at all
SARAH
Hold me
She melts into Reeses arms Pulls him to her
REESE

I love you I always will

Oh God Kyle I need you so much

She kisses him passionately They are locked together in a
timeless

moment PUSH IN TIGHT on Sarah as she buries her face in his

shoulder She shuts her eyes tight Stay on Sarah as Reese

30 INT CORRIDOR

Sarah staggers from her cell Reese is already impossibly a

hundred feet away striding down the dim corridor A
silhouette

in a long coat disappearing around a corner

Sarah runs after him her bare feet slapping the cold
linoleum

Her hospital gown floats out behind her as she dream-runs
along the

seemingly infinite corridor She reaches the corner slides
around

it and

30A Slams right into the arms of Douglas and his three helpers
They
grab her as she struggles and screams The Silberman is

there

smiling soothingly They force her down and she is pinned to

the floor screaming A new figure approaches one even
more

menacing

TERMINATOR walks toward her with heavy measured steps
Backlit

eyes concealed by the sunglasses it stands over her like the
angel

of death itself It reaches down and

Takes her hand Lifts her up Leads her to a door They go
through

together Emerging into
30B A BEAUTIFUL SUNLIGHT MORNING CHILDREN are playing nearby
sliding

down slides clambering through a jungle gym Sarah knows
this

dream know its is the worst of all her nightmares She
starts

to scream but no sound comes out
30C THE SKY EXPLODES into WHITE LIGHT Everything is seared by
the unholy

glare hotter than a thousand suns The children ignite like

match heads Sarah is burning screaming silently everything
silent

and overexposed Terminators flesh and clothing are burning

silently It grips her hand Virgil to her Dante in this tour
of the

nuclear-age Inferno
30D THE BLAST WAVE HITS a near-solid wall of compressed air
followed

by 250-mph winds The children charcoal statues frozen in
positions

of play explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away
SOUND

hit now with a thunderous roar Sarahs scream merges with
the

howl of the wind as the blast hits her exploding the flesh
from her

bones Beside her Terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh

becoming a smoking skeleton of steel
30E Then she wake up in her cell shackled to the bed
Sunlight hurts

her eyes She looks desperate and defeated She knows the

war is
coming It visits her every time she closes her eyes Lost
and

alone Sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for
humanity

SARAH
You said I could be transferred to the minimum
security wing and have visitors if I showed

CLOSE ON SARAH Her voice sounds hollow

SARAH
They dont exist I see that now

Silberman leans back studying her Toying with her
SILBERMAN
But youve told me on many occasions about how
you crushed one in a hydraulic press

So what do you think Doctor Ive shown a lot
of improvement havent I

SILBERMAN
You see Sarah heres the problem I know
how smart you are and I think youre just
telling me what I want to hear I dont think

We go tight on Sarahs reaction And we see that Silberman is

right
She was playing him and it didnt work And she knows shes
fucked
Her tone becomes quite pleading
SARAH
You have to let me see my son Please Its
very important Hes in danger At least let
me call him --
Silberman pins her with his sweet reptilian gaze
SILBERMAN
Im afraid not Not for a while I dont see
any choice but to recommend to the review board
that you stay here another six months

shes

lost She knows this guy is just playing with her and she --

the enemy

ICBMs deploy their MIRVs the warheads stream down its

The cop moves on down the concourse out of sight

John gets in an Afterburner simulator game

43B ON TERMINATOR walking through the crowd in slow motion
Scanning

He moves with methodical purpose knowing the target is close
We
see that he is incredibly carrying a box of LONG-STEM ROSES

Like

some hopeful guy with a hot date
43C THE COP is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out
at the

multi-cinema He walks into the maze of kids engaged in
synthesized
combat Cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise

43D JOHN is shooting down MiGs at Mach 2 His friend Tim slides
up next
to him Taps him on the shoulder trying to play it cool

TIM
Some cop is scoping for you dude

John looks around the corner of the Afterburner ride Sees
the cop

showing a picture to some of the kids The kids point his
way

John ducks just as the cop glances over He slinks out the
other side

of the ride and heads for the back of the store instinctively

retreating Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news

THE COP scans the crowded arcade Glimpses John looking back
as he
moves around a row of machines Starts toward him

JOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast Looks
back

THE COP is shoving through clots of kids One of them is
slammed to

the floor As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains

speed

John emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with
connects

to the parking garage Hes running full out when around the
corner

ahead of him comes

TERMINATOR Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries
to
brake to a stop Terminator reaches into the box of roses

SLOW MOTION The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at
the box

falls open the roses spilling to the floor TERMINATORS
BOOT

crushes the flowers as it moves forward

JOHN transfixed by terror is trapped in the narrow
featureless

shooting gallery of the corridor THE SHOTGUN COMES UP
Terminator

expressionlessly strides forward Jacks a round into the

chamber

slow and fluid

John looks behind him for a place to run Sees the cop coming
toward

him pulling his Beretta pistol Incredibly John realizes
the cop

is aiming his gun at him

John looks back at Terminator He is starting into the black
muzzle

of the 10-gauge now Aimed right at his head He realizes
hes

screwed Then something crazy happens

TERMINATOR
Get down

John instinctively ducks Terminator pulls the trigger
KABOOM

THE COP catches the SHOTGUNS BLAST square in the chest just
as he

fires the pistol The pistols shot goes wild

TERMINATOR pumps another round into him The another And
another

Advancing a step each time he fires he empties the shotgun
into the

cop blowing his backward down the corridor The sound is
DEAFENING

Then silence

THE COP lies still on his back

44n Terminator is now standing right over John They both watch
as the

cop incredibly sits up unharmed and gets to his feet
Terminator
grabs John roughly by his jacket Clutches the kid to his

chest

then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta
44B The cop who not only isnt a cop he clearly isnt even
human

pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-
pistol

ON TERMINATORS BACK as the 9mm slugs slam into it punching
bloody

holes in the motorcycle jacket

JOHN is bug-eyed with fear but completely unscratched
Terminators
body has blocked the bullets

The Beretta CLACKS empty Terminator turns at the sound

Shoves John behind a Coke machine Drops the empty shotgun
Starts

walking toward the cop

The empty magazine clatters to the floor

The cop inserts another one Snaps back the slide

Terminator still has twenty feet to go

He doesnt break his purposeful stride

The cop opens fire Bullets rake Terminators chest He
doesnt

even flinch

Ten feet to go BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM Neither the cop nor

Terminator

show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips
Terminators

wardrobe to shreds

CLACK The pistol empties again Terminator stops two feet
in front
of the cop The appraise each other for a second

We realize now that the cop is a terminator too We dont
know the
details yet but lets call him the T-1000 (since thats what

he is)

A newer model than the one weve come to know so well (the 800

Series Arnold) This guys a prototype and hes got
quite a

few surprises

T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up Terminator moves
first

He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back
with a
counter-grip After about two seconds of intense slamming
the walls

on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in
and

the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and

disappeared

JOHN totally stunned by all this remembers to move He
staggers to
his feet Stumble-runs toward the parking garage

44C THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE A plate glass window EXPLODES and
Terminator

crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid
the

screaming crowd
44D T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store
after

John accelerating slowly into a loping predatory run
44h Terminator is totally still A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously
steps

forward and takes a picture of the body Suddenly
Terminators
eyes snap open The stunned tourist backs away

He sits up and looks around Gets his bearings Rises
smoothly to
his feet All servos seem to be working fine The tourists

camera

whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself taking shot after
show

The owner isnt even looking through the eyepiece hes so
shocked
45 INT PARKING GARAGE

John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike scared

shitless and the damned thing wont start His hands are
shaking so

badly he cant find the choke He looks up to see --

The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him

John fumbles with the choke The bike catches He slams it
in gear

and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage

John looks back the T-1000 is behind him running He
twists the

throttle and guns the little bike forward Incredibly the T-

is gaining This nightmare isnt happening John races out
the exit
ramp and charges right into the street

46 EXT STREET

John shoots into the busy traffic Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW
TRUCK

The DRIVER swears Hits his air horn What the driver
doesnt see

is the cop running faster than OJ Simpson at the airport
who

emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck

460A IN THE TRUCK The driver hears a thump as something slams
against his
door then feels himself pulled right out T-1000 slides in

and

takes his place The truck is still rolling along about 25
mph

T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat It can
see him

up ahead weaving through traffic
46B Out of the garage entrance Terminator roars onto the street
on the

Harley

He accelerates after the others
47 EXT FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL

John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than hes
ever done
it before He races along the bottom of the canal turning

into a

narrower tributary which has vertical sides

He looks back No sign of pursuit
47A Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow

The Kenworth tow-truck big as a house all chrome and
roaring

diesel engine crashes through the fence and launches itself
right

into the center of the canal

It crashes down 15 feet to the ground going about 60 hits
at an

angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding
of

metal It ricochets back and forth between the walls then
bellowing
like a gunshot stegosaurus it just keep on plowing forward

gathering

speed
47B John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the
narrow

concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the
little bike
has The Kenworth is all muscle tearing along the canal like

a train

ina tunnel Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy
spray

backlit in the setting sun It looks like some kind of demon
And

its gaining
47C ABOVE THEM on the service road running parallel Terminator
is

fighting to overtake them He looks down and sees John with
the tow-

truck from Hell catching up to him It is only about twenty
feet

behind him and still gaining
47D ANGLE IN THE CANAL looking back past a desperate John at the
wall

of metal filling frame behind him
47E ABOVE Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left

leaving the

road Hitting an earth embankment just right he jumps the
bike into

the air like Steve McQueen in The Great Escape and vaults
the fence

bordering the canal It slams down at the edge of the canal
and tears

along inches from the drop-off on a dirt path accelerating
past the

truck in the canal below

47F John hits some water and slews momentarily loosing speed
The

massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his
back

fender Panicked he pulls a little ahead All this is
happening at

about sixty miles and hour Top speed for the little dirt
bike

47G SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again This time the
700-
pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal

It arcs

down between the truck and John hitting on its wheels It
bottoms

out an explosion of sparks under the frame Only the ultra-
fast

reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright Terminator
fights

for control
47H He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside
Johns tiny

Honda

Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and
swings him

onto the Harley in front of him Johns Honda weaves and
falls

smashing instantly under thundering tires

The Harley roars ahead It hits eighty Ahead is an
overpass and
supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two
channels The Harley thunders into one channel which is
essentially

a short tunnel

471 The truck cant fit on either side Neither can it stop at
that
speed Tires locked it slides on the muddy concrete and
piles into
the concrete abutment at seventy

ATT Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel looking back to
see a

fireball blasting through behind them as the trucks side-
tanks

explode

Terminator stops the Harley John peers around his body to
see the

destruction A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and
flops in

the mud Terminator revs the bike and they roar away down
the canal

disappearing around a bend

47K ANGLE ON THE FIRE as a column of black smoke rises from the
overpass

Smoke boils from the tunnel as well and inside it is a solid
wall of

flame A figure appears in the fire

Just an outline Walking slowly calmly
The figure emerges from the flames

It is human-shaped but far from human A smooth chrome man

Not a

servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath with its
complex

hydraulics and cables this thing is a featureless liquid
chrome

surface bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks
It

reminds us of mercury A mercury man Its face is simple
unformed

Unruffled by thousand-degree heat it walks toward us

With each step detail returns
First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the

liquid

chrome surface then finer details buttons facial
features

ears
47K But its still al chrome With its last step the color
returns to

everything It is the cop again handsome young face blond
hair

mustache Icy eyes It stops and looks around

It is a perfect chameleon A liquid metal robot A killing
machine

with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human
society
47L ANGLE NEARBY as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull
up

T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them More cops arrive
T-1000

blends in perfectly There are always cops at diasters and
scenes of
violence We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is

so

perfect

It walks among the other cops unnoticed

Gets into one of the squad cars Starts it and drives away
48 EXT SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Terminator with John in front of him on the Harley roars
down the

empty street John cranes his neck around to get a look at
the

personthing he is riding with The image is strangely
reminiscent
of fatherson

out for an evening ride

John is still in shock from the experience of what just
happened and

hes just a ten-year kid

but hes also John Connor who will

and we see a bit of that in him even know

Stop the bike

He leans the bike into a

Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop

someday

rise to greatness

JOHN
Whoa time out

Terminator immediately complies
turn

They head into a nearby alley
49 EXT ALLEY
John

slides off the gas tank
him John

checks him out

JOHN

Now dont take this the wrong way

Terminator impassively stares at

Tentatively speaks

but you are

a terminator right
TERMINATOR

Yes Cyberdyne Systems Model 101
JOHN

No way

John touches Terminators skin

Then the blood on his jacket

His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him

JOHN

Holy shit
whoah

(stepping back)

Youre uh

youre really real

like a machine underneath

I mean

right

but sort of alive outside

TERMINATOR

Im a cybernetic organism

a metal endoskeleton

JOHN
This in intense

out for myself

Get a grip

So whats the deal

Living tissue over

John Okay uh
I figured that part

John gives him an amazed look

JOHN
This is deep

Terminators wounds are not readily visible
and back
JOHN
So this other guy Hes a terminator

TERMINATOR

In the

John cranes his

too

Not like me A T-1000 Advanced prototype

A mimetic polyalloy

JOHN
What does that mean

TERMINATOR
Liquid metal

JOHN
Radical

TERMINATOR

You are targeted for termination The T-1000
will not stop until it complete its mission

Ever
John mulls that over

JOHN
Where we going
TERMINATOR
We have to leave the city immediately And
avoid the authorities

JOHN
Can I stop by my house

TERMINATOR
Negative The T-1000 will definitely try to
reacquire you there

JOHN
You sure
TERMINATOR
I would
CUT TO
51 EXT PAYPHONE
John is quickly going through his pockets for change He has
plenty
of bills but no quarters
JOHN
Look Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta
warn them Shit You got a quarter
Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off
the
phones cash box with the heel of his hand A shower of
change
tumbles out Terminator hands one to John John dials
52 INT VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with
her
shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large
knife

She answers sweetly

In the backyard

barking at

JANELLE
Hello

JOHN
(filtered through phone)
Janelle Its me

Johns German Shepherd is going bonkers
something

JANELLE
John Where are you honey Its late You
should come home dear Im making a casserole

AT THE PAYPHONE John listens an odd look on his face He
covers
the phones mouthpiece and turns to Terminator

JOHN
(whispering)
Somethings wrong Shes never this nice

IN THE VOIGHTS KITCHEN Todd comes through the kitchens
back door
Just home from work He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge

Grabs
a carton of milk Takes a sip Frowns at the dogs barking
TODD
What the hells the goddamn dog barking at
SHUT UP YOU MUTT
TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her
He
passes OUT OF FRAME next to her Janelle switches the phone
to her
other hand then THUNK Her free hand seems to do something
out of
frame There is a gurgling and the sound of liquid dribbling
onto
the floor (Dont go away Well find out what happened in a
moment )
AT THE PAYPHONE
JOHN
The dogs really barking Maybe its already
there What should I do
Terminator takes the phone from Johns hand Janelles voice
is
floating through the receiver
JANELLE
(filtered)
John John are you okay
Terminator speaks into the phone in a perfect imitation of
Johns

voice
TERMINATOR
(in Johns voice)
Im right here Im fine
(to John a whisper)
Whats the dogs name

JOHN
Max
Terminator nods Speaks into the phone
TERMINATOR

Hey Janelle whats wrong with Wolfy I can
hear him barking Is he okay

JANELLE
(filtered)
Wolfys fine honey Where are you

Terminator unceremoniously hangs up the phone Turns to John

TERMINATOR
Your foster parents are dead Lets go

Terminator heads for the bike John shocked stares after

him
53 INT VOIGHT HOUSEKITCHEN
Janelle hangs up the phone Her expression is neutral Calm
PAN OVER along her arm which is stretched out straight from
the

shoulder Partway along its length her arm has turned
smoothly into

something else a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-
like

spike Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by
the

spike which has punched through his milk carton through his
mouth

and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door His
eyes are
glassy and lifeless

The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT -- so rapidly Todd is
actually

standing there a second before he slumps out of sight THUMP
53A Janelle doesnt bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape

and
color transforming back into a hand and then
53B JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-
1000 The
change has liquid quality T-1000 opens the back door

54 EXT VOIGHT HOUSEBACKYARD - NIGHT

T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd which slinks away
from it

barking in fear T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP Reaches
down OUT

OF FRAME We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill
YELP

Then T-1000s hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog
collar

The tag reads MAX

T-1000 nods thoughtfully Heads back to the house
55 EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Dark Off a quiet street Terminator stands near the Harley

watching John pace before him Johns brain is calling time-
out

This is all too weird

JOHN
I need a minute here okay Youre telling me
it can imitate anything it touches

TERMINATOR
Anything it samples by physical contact

John thinks about that trying to grasp their opponents
parameters

JOHN
Like it could disguise itself as anything
a pack of cigarettes

TERMINATOR
No Only an object of equal size

Johns still reeling from meeting one terminator which now
seems
downright conventional next to the exotic new model

JOHN
Well why doesnt become a bomb or something to
get me

TERMINATOR

It cant form complex machines Guns and
explosives have chemicals moving parts It
doesnt work that way But it can form solid
metal shapes

56 INT VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT

T-1000 walks down the dark hall It passes the bathroom and
we see

the real Janelles legs through the half-open door The
shower is

running Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor

56A In Johns bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in
the
dark
Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any
clues that
could lead it to its target T-1000 finds a box of audio
cassettes

marked Messages from Mom In it are some letters and
envelopes

filled with snapshots It begins looking through some of the

photos

SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years Sarah in
olive

cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher teaching John how to
aim

Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men standing
next to

cases of Stinger missiles John and Sarah in a Contra camp
deep in

the mountains

57 EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

John is now sitting on the curb lost in stunned thought
Terminator

stands above him watching the street like a Doberman He
glances

down at John

JOHN
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua places
like that For a while she was with this crazy
ex-Green Beret guy running guns Then there
were some other guys Shed shack up with
anybody she could learn from So then she
could teach me how to be this great military
leader Then she gets busted and its like
sorry kid your moms a psycho Didnt you
know Its like everything Id been brought
up to believe was just made-up fantasy right
I hated her for that
(he looks up)
But everything she said was true
(he stands)
We gotta get her out of there

TERMINATOR
Negative The T-1000s highest probability for
success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and
wait for you to make contact with her

JOHN
Oh great And what happens to her

Terminators reply is matter-of-fact

TERMINATOR
Typically the subject being copied is
terminated

JOHN

TERMINATED Shit Why didnt you tell me
We gotta right now

TERMINATOR
Negative She is not a mission priority

JOHN
Yeah well fuck you shes a priority to me

John strides away Terminator goes after him and grabs him

arm

John struggles against the grip Which doesnt do him much
good

JOHN
Hey goddammit Whats your problem

Starts dragging John back to the bike John spots a couple of

collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and
starts

yelling to them
JOHN
Help HELP Im being kidnapped Get this
psycho off of me

The TWO JOCKS start toward him John yells in outrage to
Terminator

JOHN
Let go of me

To his surprise Terminators hand opens so fast John falls
right on

his butt

He looks up at the open hand

JOHN
Oww Whyd you do that

TERMINATOR
You told me to

John stares at him in amazement as he realizes

JOHN
You have to do what I say

TERMINATOR
That is one of my mission parameters

JOHN
Prove it stand on one foot

Terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg
John grins Hes the first on his block

JOHN
Cool My own terminator This is great

The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there
calmly

with one leg up in the air This big guy in black leather and
dark

glasses standing like a statue

FIRST JOCK
Hey kid You okay

John turns to him No longer needing to be rescued

JOHN
Take a hike bozo

FIRST JOCK
Yeah Fuck you you little dipshit

JOHN
Dipshit Did you say dipshit
(to Terminator)
Grab this guy
Terminator complies instantly hoisting him one-handed by the

collar
the guys legs are pinwheeling
JOHN
Now whos the dipshit you jock douchebag
Immediately things get out of hand The guys friend jumps
behind

Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson --

Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car --

Grabs the second by the hair whips out his 45 in a quick
blur and

aims the muzzle at the guys forehead

John grabs Terminators arm with a yell as he pulls the

trigger --

Johns weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches
The

guy flinches stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear He
stares

shocked Pissing himself John is freaking out too
He screams at Terminator

JOHN
Put the gun down NOW

Terminator sets the 45 on the sidewalk John scoops it up
fast then

turns to the shocked civilians who cant believe what just
happened

JOHN
Walk away

They do Fast John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him

toward
the bike John still holds the gun reluctant to give it
back
JOHN
Jesus you were gonna kill that guy
TERMINATOR
Of course Im a terminator
John stares at him Having your own terminator just became a
little

bit less fun to him

JOHN
Listen to me very carefully okay Youre not
a terminator any more Alright You got that
You cant just go around killing people

TERMINATOR
Why

JOHN
Whattaya mean why Cause you cant

TERMINATOR
Why

JOHN
You just cant okay Trust me on this

Terminator doesnt get it John just stares at him
Frightened at

what just almost happened He gets a glimpse of the
responsibility

59 CLOSE ON A BLACK and WHITE PHOTOGRAPH The image is a nightmare
from
the past It is a surveillance camera still-frame from the
LA

police station where the first terminator made such an
impression in

1984 We see the blurry forms of the cop frozen in the
emergency

lights of a burning corridor

A black-clad figure stands at the end of the corridor The
guy has
short-cropped hair and dark glasses An AR-80 assault rifle

in one
hand and a 12-gauge in the other -- holding them both like
toy
pistols
ANOTHER PHOTO is slapped on top of the first Another still-
frame
blow-up is placed over the last Terminator looms in CLOSEUP

station in 1984 You were there

59A INT INTERVIEW ROOMPESCADERO - NIGHT

The photos are lying on the table in front of Sarah placed
there by

DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY His partner DET MOSSBERG and Dr
Silberman

sit at the table as well Two uniformed cops plus Douglas
stand by

the door Sarah stares listlessly at the top photo Shes

withdrawn haggard drugged-looking

MOSSBERG
He killed seventeen police officers that night
Recognize him

Weathersby slaps another black-and-white eight-by-ten on the
table

A closeup of Terminator taken by the Japanese tourist at the
mall

Its the same face

MOSSBERG
This one was taken by a Japanese tourist today

Sarah doesnt react Its hard to tell shes thinking
Whether shes
up hope or is just in a drugged stupor

WEATHERSBY
Ms Connor youve been told that your sons
missing His foster parents have been murdered
and we know this guys involved Talk to us
Dont you care

Sarah stares up at him A cold and empty stare He glances
at
Silberman
Then at his partner

MOSSBERG
Were wasting out time

One of the uniformed cops opens the door and Mossberg strides

into

the hall Weathersby and the two uniforms follow him out
with

Silberman right behind

SILBERMAN
Sorry gentleman

TIGHT ON SARAH slumped under the bright lights Totally out

of it

Then we see her hand creeping along the edge of the table
toward the
stack of photos She slips off the paper clip binding the

stills

together and hides it between her fingers Douglas jerks her
up by

the arms and leads her out

60 INT SARAHS CELL

Douglas inches up the last of Sarahs restraints Then her
leans

over her looking down Even wrecked as she is we see the
beauty

in her face He bends down We think hes going to kiss her

Instead he runs his tongue across her face like a dog would
She

seems not to even see him Her dull eyes past him He cant

provoke a reaction Even here strapped down the two of them
alone

she give him no superiority He smirks and leaves We hear
the

sound of his night-stick tapping its way down the corridor
growing

fainter

Sarahs eyes snap suddenly alert There is intensity and
resolve in

them She slips the paper clip out from between her fingers
and

awkwardly spreads it open into a straight piece of wire With
slow

painful concentration she moves it toward the lock of the
restraints
that bind her wrists to the bed at her sides

utility closet across the hall is open He goes to shut it

absently flicking his light into the dark closet He notices
something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies A
s

on the floor with its handle snapped off about halfway up
other half is missing

Douglas ponders this for half a second then hears a SOUND
him

and spins around The sound he heard was Sarahs cell door
The missing two feet of MOP HANDLE fill his vision as it
viciously across the bridge of his nose

250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of
Sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back
head bouncing him off the linoleum Lights out Douglas
She drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own
Then

swaps her mop-handle for his nice heavy night-stick

Sarah moves down the dark corridor cat-stepping in her bare

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ENTRANCECORRIDOR

A long corridor ends at a reception area which is closed and

NIGHT RECEIVING DESK which is a glass window where they can
ul
in through a heavy door A NIGHT NURSE types at a desk
nearby She
looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (T-

1000)
walking toward her
T-1000
You have a Sarah Connor here
She assumes hes with the other cops Smiles
NIGHT NURSE
Running late arent you
She turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees Silberman
and the
cops coming toward the door from the other side
NIGHT NURSE
Your friends are on their way out now
When she turns back to the window T-1000s no longer there
She
goes to the counter and leans out to see if hes at the
drinking
fountain or someplace No Reception is empty And so is
the long
corridor beyond She frowns Too weird
66A Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and
Weathersby the two uniformed cops and the hospital security
guard
The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind
the
night desk Silberman faces him
SILBERMAN
Lewis see these gentleman out and them lock
up for the night
The security guard nods Silberman goes back into the secure
area of
the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the
main
doors No sign of T-1000 Mossberg and the other cops exit
and
the guard locks the door behind them
66B The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor The hall
is

dark with the light at the night desk far ahead like a
sanctuary
His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor His keys
jingle

66C ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guards feet pass through FRAME An
instant

later the floor starts to move

It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass still
retaining the

two-tone checkerboard of the tile It hunches up silently

into a

quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard
66D Up ahead we hear typing The night nurse has her back to us
working

The guard stops as the drinking fountain Bends to take a
sip

Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and
begins to

resolve rapidly into a human figure It loses the color and
texture

of the tile and becomes THE GUARD

T-1000s mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick
over

several square yards of floor The guard walked over the T-
1000 and

his structure was sampled that instant Now we see it drawing

in and

pulling up to form the figure of the guard

The T-1000Guards feet are the last to form the last of the
liquid

floor pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes The shoes
detach

with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-
1000Guard
takes its first step

66E The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see
himself

He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the
ramifications of

that Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and

inexplicably points his right index finger directly at the

real

guards face about a foot away In a split second the
finger

spears out elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out
like a

stiletto slamming into the guards eye
It punches into the corner of the eye past the eyeball like a
trans-
orbital lobotomy tool and emerges from the back of the
guards skull

Life quietly empties from the guards face He is dead

weight

hanging from the rodfinger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK
As the

guard slumps the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand
and

walks him like its carrying a suit on a hanger back toward
the

night desk The wounds are so tiny no blood drips onto the
floor
66F ON THE NIGHT NURSE glancing up as the T-1000Guard walks
past

dragging something casually which she cant see because its
below

the countertop

NIGHT NURSE
Whatcha got Lewis

T-1000GUARD
Just some trash

She nods uninterested Keeps typing T-1000 moves past
dragging

the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night

receiving station T-1000Guard removes the Browning High-
Power

pistol and the keys from the real guards belt then stuffs
the body

into the utility closet

66G INT CORRIDORNIGHT RECEIVING DESK
T-1000Guard comes back out and glances at the nurse

T-1000GUARD
All set

She glances toward it Sees the Beretta in its holster

NIGHT NURSE
Gotta check the gun first Lewis

T-1000GUARD
Yeah sorry

T-1000 opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its
body as
it mimes putting the gun in

66H CLOSE ANGLE ON T-1000S CHEST from inside the locker
Instead of
setting the gun in the locker it inserts the pistol into it
own
chest where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a
pot of
hot fudge It withdraws its hand The chest is once again a
surface
that looks like cloth buttons name-tag etc Youd ever
guess it was
really an intelligent liquid metal

T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the

button

unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK T-1000Guard goes
through

CUT TO

67 INT ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT

A small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to
prevent

violent inmates from making a run for it There are doors at
each

end The first one is barred like a jail-cell door and the
second

is a steel fire door The attendants have a video monitor
with which
they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors

The two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000Guard as it
approaches Looks briefly at a chart next to the door seeing
SARAH CONNOR is in 19

67A IN THE ISOLATION WARD the T-1000 passes a nurses station
which looks

a cage walled in by heavy metal mesh Silberman leaning in
the open

doorway is talking to an attendant in the cage He doesnt

glance

twice at Lewis the Guard passing by
68 SARAH moving like a ghost in the darkened corridor hears
footsteps

coming and quietly but quickly unlocks a cell next to her with
Douglas master key

68A She slips into the cell and waits as the footsteps pass
We glimpse the T-1000Guard pass the window
She waits as the footsteps fade away She looks over A

female

inmate strapped to a bed watches her with bird-like eyes
She puts

a finger to her lips -- SSHHH The inmate nods Sarah exits
68B POV MOVING TOWARD nurses station We hear Silbermans voice

reviewing medication with the night attendant

ON SILBERMAN yawning looking at his watch

He turns to go Sarah is there

She slams into him hurling him through the door into the cage
and

follows him in The orderly jumps up going for his stunner
but she

nails him with Douglas baton WHAP-WHAP-WHAP You can

barely see

the thing shes swinging it so fast The guys goes down

Silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard

on his
arm He cries out and grabs his wrist
She grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk
smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton
His legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the
desk
She pins him with one hand He face is full of outraged
disbelief
SILBERMAN
You broke my arm
SARAH
Theres 215 bones in the human body motherfucker
Thats one Now dont move
68B Moving rapidly she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a
syringe
They keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients
She
jams it into the orderlys butt and fires the whole shot
Still
holding the empty syringe she sees what she need next
They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the
inmates from
drinking Drano She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUMR and
slams

it down on the desk inches from Silbermans eyes

She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug
Draws back the plunger The syringe fills with blue liquid
She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into

Silbermans neck

stares

His horrified eyes rack toward it 10 ccs of blue death fill

Her thumb hovers over the plunger
She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip
then hauls him through the door
IN THE CORRIDOR outside cell 19 the T-1000 stops and looks in
window Douglas his face a bloody mess yells to be heard
DOUGLAS

Open the door The goddamn bitch is loose in

the halls
To Douglas amazement Lewis the Guard turns impassively and
away leaving him shouting soundlessly at the window

CUT TO

EXT HOSPITAL

Terminator and John are approaching the guard gate on the

They can see the guard inside looks up at the sound of the

JOHN
Now remember youre not gonna kill anyone
right

TERMINATOR
Right

John looks at him Hes not convinced

JOHN
Swear

TERMINATOR
What

JOHN

Just say I swear I wont kill anyone
John holds his hand up like hes being sworn in Terminator

at John a beat Then mimics the gesture
TERMINATOR
I swear I will not kill anyone

Terminator stops the bike and gets off
The guard sensing trouble has his gun drawn as he comes out

of the

shack Terminator walks toward him drawing his 45 smoothly
BLAM

He shoots the guard accurately in the thigh

The guy drops screaming and clutching his leg

Terminator kicks the guards gun away then smashes the phone
in the

shack with his fist He pushes the button to raise the gate
and walks
back to the bike

TERMINATOR
Hell live

Terminator climbs onto the bike They drive toward the
hospital

heading down an ambulance ramp to an underground receiving
area

71 INT ISOLATION FLOOR

The attendants at the security checkpoint look up at the
monitor as

someone enters the corridor They see Sarah holding
Silberman at

syringe-point

Sarah speaks to them through an intercom on the wall Her
voice

comes through the speaker

SARAH
Open it or hell be dead before he hits the
floor

The attendants adrenaline levels just went off the scale
The first

attendant shakes him head no The amperage here is really
high The

second attendant keys the intercom switch

2ND ATTENDANT
Theres no way Connor Let him go

Silbermans face is the color of suet

SILBERMAN
It wont work Sarah Youre no killer I dont
believe youd do it

Her voice is a deadly cold hiss

SARAH
Youre already dead Silberman Everybody here
dies You know I believe that So dont fuck
with me

SILBERMAN
Open the goddamn door

The attendants looks at one another One of them hits the
solenoid
button The far door unlocks

71A IN THE LOCKOUT CORRIDOR Sarah pushes Silberman ahead of her
The nearer barred door must be unlocked manually
One of the attendants cautiously approaches Nervously
unlocks it

SARAH
Step back

He does She faces both of them

SARAH
Down on the floor Now

They comply She comes through with Silberman giving them a

wide

berth Starts backing down the hall away from them still
holding

her hostage Shes actually pulling this off
71B ANGLE FROM BEHIND HER What we can see but she cant see it
a

third orderly waiting just around the corner Hes poised
ready to
jump her when she comes abreast of him

ON SARAH backing up She reaches the corner

The third attendant lunges grabbing her syringe-hand

Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat
with the

nightstick He loses interest fast dropping to his knees and

gagging Silberman pulls away screaming at the top of his
lungs

SILBERMAN
Get her
They scramble up as Sarah takes off like a shot around the

corner

One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound
72 IN THE ISOLATION WARD the T-1000 is looking in at a very
stoned

attendant inside the nurses station when the alarms shriek
through

the halls It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm
pistol

Heads for the security entrance
73 IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital Sarah
flies

past us her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles The
orderlies

charge after her

Shes like an animal in a maze She turns the corner
glancing off

the wall and sprints on without slowing She reaches a steel
door

Tries it Locked

Footsteps like a drum solo behind her

She fumbles with Douglas keys breathing hard Jams the
master in

The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt

Sarah gets the door open Dives through Slams it

She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the
latch

on the other side Hes too late

Sarah sees them beyond the window fumbling with their keys
73A Sarah is in another sally-port corridor A jail-cell type
barred

door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond

She sprints to the walls of bars jams her key into the door

She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the
latch of

the one she just came through being unlocked

She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the
first

orderly comes through behind her

She slams the bars shut CLANG

Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from
her

The orderly is racing at her white-lipped with rage
She reaches back through the bars turns the key and
purposefully

snaps it off in the lock An instant later the big orderly
slams

against the door grabbing through the bars for her as she
dances

back just out of reach

He lunges against the steel bars unbelievably pissed off

Sarah takes off running looking back at the frustrated
orderlies

Theyre shouting at each other unable to fit their keys into
the

lock --

The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys
in

Silberman shouts at them

SILBERMAN
Go around goddamnit Go around

The orderlies run back the way they came and along a cross-
corridor

to another set of doors

73B ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead
Now shes home-free At a full-tilt sprint shes nearly
there when
the elevator doors part

TERMINATOR steps out his head swivels to face her

Sarah reacts stricken by the image from her worst nightmares
Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward

Her bare feet slip on the slick tile She slams to the floor
staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun

She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity

Shes not even aware that she is screaming or what would be

screaming if she could get the breath to do it

In slowed-down dream-time Sarah scrambles back along the
floor like a

crab spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall

She runs like the wind like in her nightmare If she looked
back she

would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind

Terminator John however catches a glimpse of the fleeing
Sarah and

figures out instantly what happened

JOHN
Mom Wait
Sarah doesnt hear She has clicked fully into her own
nightmare
They take off running after Sarah

73C She is pelting down the long corridor back the way she came
As she

reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad
figure

blurs from that corridor The orderly hits her in a flying
tackle

She skids across the floor shrieking and struggling The
other two
orderlies leap into the fray

SARAH
No Help me Goddamnit its gonna kill us
all

She is shouting pleading trying to get them to understand
what is

coming They grab her thrashing arms and legs They dont
even look

where the out-of-control woman is pointing back along the
corridor

They have pinned her to the cold tiles a ring of faces above
her

Silberman leans down to her holding a syringe with a heavy
dose of

trank Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of

Terminator coming up behind them It is exactly her
nightmare

She screams in utter hopelessness

Terminator holding the shotgun in one hand reaches down and

grabs

one of the orderlies with his other hand He hurls the 200-
pound

guys against the far wall of the corridor SMACK He drops
to the

floor

The other two orderlies react instantly leaping onto the
intruder

Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big
guys

Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures as the
orderlies are

flung outward like they stepped on a land mine

One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught
before a
two-story fall by the outer steel bars The other crashes
through an
office door splintering it into kindling

Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah He is grabbed by a roll
of skin

at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat The doctor
feel his

feet pedaling above the ground He looks into the
expressionless

face And it hit him Sarah was right this guy isnt
human

He feels the fabric of reality crumbling

Then he feels himself flying through the air The wall smacks
him

then the floor kicks him in the face He decides to lie there
a

second

Sarah blinks staring up at the figure looming over her
John kneels next to her

JOHN
Mom are you okay

She looks from Terminator to John Back to Terminator
Is this a nightmare Or has she finally gone truly bad

Incredibly Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her
offering
to help her up The last thing she ever expected to see

TERMINATOR
Come with me if you want to live

The orderlies are stirring

JOHN
Its all right Mom Hes here to help

Sarah is a daze takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers
Terminator lifts her to her feet

73D John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away on the other side
of the

walls of bars John doesnt know what we know but he knows

somethings not right with this guy Terminator turns to
follow

Johns gaze

The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand at its side

Terminator pushes John behind him They start backing up
73E The T-1000 walks forward reaching the bars It doesnt stop
Its body divides like jello around the bars As it squeezes

itself

through like metal playdough its surface reforms perfectly on
our

side We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous
paste

forced past an obstacle

Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching
this

That faint snapping sound is his mind

There is a CLANK and we see that the guards gun has caught
against

the bars the only solid object The T-1000 turns its wrist
and

tries again slipping the gun endwise through the gap
73F Sarah is agape Not reacting Its been a heavy day for her

Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him
up onto

his back John grabs him around the neck Terminator raises
the

shotgun and starts backing up

TERMINATOR
Go Run

Sarah doesnt need to be told twice

T-1000 walks toward them opening fire with the Browning Hi-
Power

Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES

The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the
corridor is

filled with high-velocity lead One of them stupidly running
for the

cross-corridor gets hit by the T-1000

Terminator is hammered by several slugs and the T-1000 is
cratered

by two buckshots hits It staggers but comes on In the
craters

we see bright mercury before they close and reseal
disappearing ina

second
73G Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run
Ahead

Sarah is already at the elevator Terminator and John pile in
and

John slaps the button for Garage Level

The doors start to close T-1000 clears the corner
Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as
the

T-1000 charges at them rapid firing the Browning

The rounds hit the steel doors as they close

T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap
73H nside they see the backside of the doors denting with the
hits that

are punching holes in the other side
731 The Browning locks open empty T-1000 drops it without a
glance

back The doors close K-WHAM The T-1000 hits them a split
second

later The elevator hasnt moved yet SSWWIKK
73d A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors forcing
them

open Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap
Punches

the muzzle right INTO T-1000s face -- BOOM
73K We get a glimpse of the T-1000s head blown apart by the
blast It

is hurtled back The doors close The car descends

73L ON THE T-1000 outside the elevator Its head which is blown
apart

into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders reforms
quickly

There is no trace of the injury It sees the closed door and
jams its

hands between them its fingertips becoming pry-bars It
pulls the

doors apart with inhuman strength
73M and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT
t falls two floors and

74 N THE ELEVATOR Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof
Terminator reloading the shotgun looks up

Sarah grabs the 45 from his waistband and aims it at the

ceiling

BEAT

Then CLANGG a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling

and spears

down four feet into the elevator car

t is inches from Sarahs face

She opens fire BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof

Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again

slashing
Terminators jacket and missing John by inches

Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM the 12-guage opens a

fq

hole in
the ceiling
Terminator rocks out in a fury of firingcockingfiring as the

metal

shafts slash down again and again Sarah yells in pain as one
of them

slices open her upper arm
75 The doors open Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is
wide

enough

They emerge into the basement We see the Harley parked
nearby

Terminator in a rearguard action fires another blast through
the

ceiling and runs out He throws his leg over the Harley
kicks it to

life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of

the

inner pocket of his jacket He throws it to John A road
flare
76 In the elevator the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling
big

enough to

Pour itself through

A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening The mass
drops

through the hole down out of frame then comes back up into
frame

as Officer X

It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together
after

doing this king of taffy-pull with itself It opens its eyes
and

sees --
77 TERMINATOR the shot gun held in his teeth astride the
roaring

Harley twenty feet away Terminator twists the throttle and
pops the

clutch

The back tire screams on the concrete The front wheel lifts
off the

ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie

Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the
elevator

The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right
through the

back wall of the elevator

Terminator rolls to his feet

Johns strikes the flare on the concrete Tosses it

Terminator catches the life flare with one hand

Levels the shotgun with the other

With his last round he blows a big hole in the bikes gas
tank

Gas splashes everywhere covering the struggling T-1000

Terminator tosses the flare KA-VOOOM

The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet
enveloping him
in the fireball He gets up smoking and runs after John and

Sarah
toward the exit ramp
78 AT THE EXIT RAMP They are partway up when a blue-and-white
hospital
security car comes screeching down the other way
Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car It skids
toa
shrieking halt Shes in the guys face with the 45 in both
hands
SARAH
Out of the car
The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM she puts
a round
through the glass next to his head
SARAH
RIGHT NOW
The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as
Terminator arrives The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of
the way

and slides behind the wheel Sarah gets John into the back
seat and
dives into the front passenger seat as --

78A Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it lighting
up the

tires on the slick ramp

Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and
tells him

to reload John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army
jacket

and starts feeding them in

Terminator power backward up the ramp scraping along one
wall barely

in control Because

719 The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below
fq

This guy wont quit Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as

it

runs

t sprints up the ramp after the retreating car T-1000 is

gaining
80 Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the 45 She
snatches

it drops the other out and slaps in the new one Cocks the
slide

The car backs along the service driveway toward the security
gate

John hands the shot gun back to Terminator

He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer
The T-1000s face is right in the headlights

80A Terminator fires blowing a hole in its shoulder Shiny
liquid metal

visible in the hole which then closes

80B Sarah half out the passenger window opens fire

The car crashes backward through the security barricade

TERMINATOR
(calmly)
Hang on

He cuts the wheel hard The car slews into a reverse 180
swapping

ends with a screech

T-1000 is almost on them

Terminator punches it The car accelerates forward

80C T-1000 leaps Lands on the trunk

Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk
lid

Feet dragging on the pavement it slams its other hand down

punching another metal hook into the trunk lid pulling itself
up

Terminator turns to Sarah

TERMINATOR
Drive

Terminator heaves himself half out the drivers window Sarah
slaps

her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger
side
80D T-1000 fully on the car now holds on with one hook-hand
while it

slams the other into the back window sweeping away the glass
and

missing John by inches as he ducks
It draws back for another swing lunging forward as --

80E Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car
Fires point-blank
Hits the T-1000s arm just above the hand which anchors it

to the

car The 12-guage blows the arm apart severing the hook-
hand
80F T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car

John looks out the back window his eyes wide

He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running

But hes dropping way behind now Sarah has the car floored
and the

liquid-metal killer wont catch them on foot
80G John watches in awe as the crowbar hand stuck into the
trunk

right in front of him reverts to the neutral polyalloy a
kind of

think mercury The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car
and

falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob
80H The car speeds off into the night

REVERSE on the T-1000 walking now coming right up into
closeup

watching the tail lights recede It looks down
801 ANGLE ON BLACKTOP tight on the liquid metal blob Next to it
is the

T-1000s shiny cop shoe The mercury blob crawls and rejoins
the

main mass disappearing into the shoe

A GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of
moonlight
highway Headlights off the hospital security car punches a

hole in

the wind
81A INSIDE THE SPEEDING CAR the energy is still high The air is
blowing

in the shattered windows as Terminator drives the car easily
by

electronic night-vision His eyes glow faintly red

JOHN
Can you see anything
81B TERMINATORS POV A monochrome image of the highway lit

bright as
day
81C Terminator replies in a matter-of-fact tone
TERMINATOR
Everything
JOHN
Cool

Sarah looks at Terminator still not quite believing this is
happening But this is a different Sarah than the waitress of

She spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable
Then she turns to John in the back seat
SARAH
You okay
He nods She reaches for John and we think shes going to hug
him

She starts to rub her hands over him and we realize shes
checking for

injuries very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for
broken bones

He pulls away from her He hates her always checking him
treating
him like he might break like some piece of rare china

JOHN
I said I was okay

Sarah looks at him exasperated and stern

SARAH
It was stupid of you to go there

John stares at her surprised

SARAH
Goddamnit John you have to be smarter than
that Youre too important You cant risk
yourself not even for me do you understand
I can take care of myself I was doing fine
Jesus John You almost got yourself killed

We see his chin quiver Hes a tough kid but all he really
wants is
for her to love him He hasnt had enough years on the planet

yet to
be the man of steel she demands
JOHN
I had to get you out of the place Im
sorry I
His face crumples He starts to cry Sarah gives him a cold
stare
SARAH
Stop it Right now You cant cry John
Other kids can afford to cry You cant
Hes trying to be brave he really is Terminator turns and
sees the
water leaking from his eyes It doesnt make and sense to
him
TERMINATOR

What is wrong with your eyes

John turns away ashamed Sarah lets her breath out
realizing how

keyed up she is She turns to Terminator giving him a wary
once-
over
SARAH
So whats your story
CUT TO
82 EXT MENTAL HOSPITAL

The cops have shown up as they always do There are black-
and-whites

everywhere and ambulances are arriving Two cops and an
orderly are

required to subdue poor Doctor Silberman who is raving at the
top of

his lungs

SILBERMAN
it was all true and were all going to die
and the changed I saw him change

Its quite pathetic
A nurse shoots him up with a sedative They lead him away
82A T-1000 walks unperturbed among the milling cops No one
notices him
It slips into its cruiser and drives off into the night

83 INT CAR
Terminator drives steadily into the black night

SARAH
This T-1000 what happens when you shoot it

TERMINATOR
Ballistic penetration shocks it but only for a
few seconds

Sarah thinks about that Then

SARAH
Can it be destroyed

TERMINATOR
Unknown

They ride along in silence for a few seconds
Sarah sees something up ahead some lonely neon in the
blackness

SARAH
Pull in here We have to ditch this car

84 EXT SERVICE STATION - NIGHT

A rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one
around

They pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty
office A

sign in the window says CLOSED SUNDAYS They continue around

the
building to the garages back door
AT THE GARAGE DOOR Terminator breaks the lock on the roll-up
door
and raises it Sarah pulls the security car in out of sight
Terminator rolls the door down behind them

Dark Sarah switches on the single drop-light She and
Terminator

look at each other Terminator is shot-up and bleeding and
Sarah
has a vicious slash in her upper arm which was soaked her

sleeve with

blood

a bloody
rag Picks up a clean one
WIDER Sarah sits on an empty crate Terminators is beside
her
suturing her wound with some fine wire from the winding of an
alternator Using a pair of needlenose pliers he draws the
wire
through her pale skin with a delicate hand
TERMINATOR
I have detailed files on human anatomy
Sarah stares into his face inches away fighting the pain
She
doesnt like him being this close to her to begin with let
alone
carving on her
SARAH
Ill bet Makes you a more efficient killer
right
TERMINATOR
Correct
CUT TO
87 TIGHT ON TERMINATORS BACK The leather jacket is riddled

with bullet

holes Sarah and John help pull it off revealing

Terminators

broad muscular back beneath
WIDER John and Sarah stare in amazement There are at least
twenty

bullet holes in him Back Arms Legs Fortunately theyre
all

9mm The holes are small and the damage cosmetic

JOHN
Does it hurt
TERMINATOR
I sense injuries The data could be called

pain

TIGHT ON SARAH AND TERMINATOR Sarah starts washing the
bullet holes
in his broad back with alcohol

SARAH
Will these heal up

Terminator nods She reaches into the bloody wounds with
pliers and

finds the copper-jacketed bullets flattening against the
armored

endoskeleton Pulls them out They CLINK one by one into a
glass

SARAH
Thats good Because if you cant pass for
human you wont be much good to us

She concentrates on removing the slugs CLINK CLINK

JOHN
How long do you live I mean last

TERMINATOR
A hundred and twenty years on my existing
power cell

Sarah nods pulling out another slug CLINK The glass
nearly full

of flattened bullets She begins to sew the holes closed with
a few

wire sutures John watches in quiet amazement the two
warriors

calmly fixing each other

JOHN
Can you learn So you can be you know
More human Not such a dork all the time
Terminator turns towards him

TERMINATOR
My CPU is a neural-net processor a learning
computer But Skynet presets the switch to
read-only when we are sent out alone

SARAH
(cynical)
Doesnt want you thinking too much huh

TERMINATOR
No

JOHN
Can we reset the switch

CUT TO
88 ECU OF AN X-ACTO KNIFE cutting into Terminators scalp at
the base
of his skull His voice calmly directs Sarah as she spreads
the bloody

incision and locates the maintenance port for the CPU in the
chrome
skull beneath

TERMINATOR
Now open the port cover

She wipes away the blood and uses the garage-mechanics air
tools to
unscrew the port cover

88A TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED) as he watches her work in a mirror
theyve

taken from the washroom Sarah and John are standing behind
him

Her hands are covered with blood like a surgeons

Following the instructions she reaches in with a pair of
tweezers and

CUT TO
89 TIGHT ON JOHN AND SARAH looking at what she has removed A

reddish-
brown ceramic rectangle with a connector on one end About
the size

and shape of a domino On close inspection it appears to be
made up

of small cubes connected together It is identical to the
shattered

one in the vault at Cyberdyne Systems Now we know it is that
that

Miles Dyson values so highly The brain of a terminator

89A WIDER John walks around Terminator and looks at his face
Eyes open he is completely inert Dead

John lifts his huge hand The dead servos whine sullenly as
he forces

them Its like rigor mortis He releases the hand and it
stays in

the lifted position Sarah examines the CPU chip

JOHN
Can you see the pin switch

She ignores him See looks at Terminator

The back at the chip

Then she sets it on the work table and picks up a small sledge
hammer

John realizes what she is about to do Dives at her as the
sledge is

whistling down

JOHN
No

He slaps his hand down over the chip
Sarah barely stops the sledge before smashing his fingers

SARAH
Out of the way John

JOHN
No Dont kill him

SARAH
It John Not him It

JOHN
Alright it We need it

John keeps his hand right where it is

SARAH
Were better off by ourselves
JOHN
But its the only proof we have to the future
about the war and all that

SARAH
I dont trust it These things are hard to
kill John believe me I know We may never
have this opportunity again

JOHN
Look Mom if Im supposed to ever be this great
leader you should start listening to my
leadership ideas once in a while Cause if you
wont nobody else will

Smart kid Hes got her She nods reluctantly He palms
the chip
and studies it minutely

89B John takes a pin and moves the almost invisible switch to the
other

position

It is now in write mode Then he grimaces as he inserts the
wafer

back into the slot in Terminators skull
89C TERMINATOR VISION flares back to life in a burst of static

Terminator backs off the throttle slightly

TERMINATOR

JOHN
No no no You gotta listen to the way people
talk See you dont say like Affirmative or

Terminator nods filing away the information Sarah is
ignoring the
lesson lost in thought

Okay Bad example Over there look

John points at THREE TEENAGE GUYS standing at a drinking
fountain
nearby One of them has said something funny and the others

are
laughing grinning
JOHN
Like that
TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED) The real-time image continues
while a

replay of one of the guys grinning runs in a window It
expands so

that the guys mouth fills the window Replays again in slow
motion

A vector-graphic of the lips smiling appears along with an
array of

symbolic data

Terminator tries it The result is dismal A rictus-like
curling of

the lip Terminators next effort is a marginal improvement

unable to

deal with her silence goes around to where Terminator is
working

nearby
viciously squirting each other

Are so

John and Terminator watch them rolling on the ground in a
fight to the

death Sarah rounds the front of the truck and sees the
kids John

sighs solemn He looks up at the cyborg

JOHN
Were not gonna make it are we People I
mean

TERMINATOR

It is in your nature to destroy yourselves
John nods depressed

JOHN
Yeah Drag huh

SARAH
I need to know how Skynet get built Whos
responsible

TERMINATOR

The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet
Dyson Director of Special Projects at
Cyberdyne Systems Corporation

SARAH
Why him

TERMINATOR
In a few months he creates a revolutionary
type of mircoprocessor

SARAH
Then what
98B Terminator closes the hood and gets into the truck as he
speaks
TERMINATOR

In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier of military computer systems All
stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne
computers becoming fully unmanned Afterward
the fly with a perfect operational record

SARAH
(getting behind John)
Uh huh great Then those fat fucks in
Washington figure what the hell let a computer
run the whole show right

TERMINATOR

Basically

(starting the engine backing

out)
The Skynet funding bill is passed The system
goes on-line August 4th 1997 Human decisions
are removed from strategic defense Skynet
begins to learn at a geometric rate It becomes
self-aware at 214 am eastern time August 29
In a panic they try to pull the plug

SARAH
And Skynet fights back

They accelerate back onto the highway

TERMINATOR
Yes It launches its ICBMs against their
targets in Russia

SARAH
Why attack Russia

TERMINATOR

Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike
will remove its enemies here

back of his neck He smiles and turns to kiss her good

Shes still in her bathrobe holding coffee Hes been up for

She watches him work the arcane symbols moving across the

We see her frustration her inability to truly enter the magic
of his world

TARISSA
You going to work all day

DYSON
Im sorry baby This thing is just kicking my
ass I thought we had it with this one

He points to a metal box on his desk about two feet long As
assembly of small cubes It looks like a dinosaur version of
Terminators CPU

DYSON
but the output went to shit after three
seconds Im thinking now its the way Im

matrixing the command hierarchies

TARISSA
You need a break Youll see it clear when you
come back

DYSON
I cant

TARISSA
Miles its Sunday You promised to take the
kids to Raging Waters today

DYSON
Oh I cant honey Im on a roll here

He takes her hands We see a childlike excitement in his
face He

wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of
discovery

the satisfaction of creation

DYSON
Baby this thing is going to blow em all away
Its a neural-net process --

TARISSA

I know You told me Its a neural-net
processor It thinks and learns like we do
Its superconducting at room temperature
Other computer are pocket calculators by
comparison

(she pulls away from him)
But why is that so goddamn important Miles
I really need to know cause I feel like Im
going crazy here sometimes

DYSON
Im sorry honey its just that Im thiiis
close
He holds up his thumb and index finger a fraction of an
inch apart
She picks up the prototype It doesnt look like much

DYSON
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes
a mistake never gets tired never shows up to
work with a hangover

Meet the pilot

TARISSA
Why did you marry me Miles Why did we have
these two children You dont need us Your

heart and your mind are in here

in her hands)

But it doesnt love you like we do

He takes the anodized box from her hands and sets it down
Then he

puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently She
acquiesces

to his kiss

DYSON
Im sorry

Tarissa glances over his shoulder She nods her head toward
the

doorway to the study Dyson turns and sees their two kids
standing

there Danny and Blythe look rumpled and adorable in

A101 AHEAD is a pathetic oasis of humanity in the vast wasteland a
couple

of aging house-trailers surrounded by assorted junk vehicles
and

desert-style trash There is a dirt airstrip behind the

His fierce face breaks into a broad grin The shotgun drops
to his
side as he walks toward her When he reaches her he hugs her
then

steps back

Good to see you Connor I knew youd make it
back here sooner or later

Salceda rips the cap off the tequila bottle The two-year-old
toddles

to Terminator and grabs his pants sliming them with drool
Terminator looks down at the tiny kid fascinated What is

He picks up the child with one huge hand Looks at it Turns

different ways Studying it Then sets it down The kid
waddles

off a little dizzy

SALCEDA
Honey take Pacolito Thanks baby

She hands him the tequila and takes the child Salceda takes

a long

pull from the Cuervo bottle

Terminator gestures no at the proffered bottle but Sarah
grabs it

and takes a long pull She lowers it without expression Her

tractor John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its

treads
pulling some massive load A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel
plate
moves Slowly under six inches of sand

Uninterested

Terminator has found a Vietnam-era blooper M-79 grenade
launcher

A very crude but effective weapon He opens the breech and
inspects

the bore

JOHN
Are you ever afraid
Terminator pauses for a second The thought never occurred to
him
He searches him mind for the answer

TERMINATOR
No

Terminator slings the M-79 and starts looking for the
grenades

JOHN
Not even of dying

TERMINATOR
No

JOHN
You dont feel any emotion about it one way
or the other

No I have to stay functional until my mission
is complete Then it doesnt matter

John is idly spinning a Sig Saur 9mm pistol on his finger
backwards
and forwards like Bat Masteron

JOHN

Yeah I have to stay functional too

Tm too important

Terminator pulls back a canvas tarp revealing a squat heavy

weapon

with six barrels clustered in a blunt cylinder Chain-ammo is

Why do you cry

JOHN
You mean people I dont know We just cry
You know When it hurts

TERMINATOR
Pain causes it

JOHN
Uh-unh no its different Its when theres
nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway You
get it

TERMINATOR
No

Terminator gets into the Bronco and turns the ignition key and
the
engine catches with a roar

JOHN
Alriight My man

TERMINATOR
No problemo

John grins and does a victorious thumbs up

Terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly

John laughs and makes him get out of the truck to try the
move again

A108 SARAH across the compound pauses in her work to watch John
and

Terminator
A109 SARAHS POV we dont hear what John and Terminator are

saying It

is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other
gestures

to the cyborg Trying to get him to walk more casually John

walks

then Terminator tries it then John gestures wildly talking
very

fast explaining the fundamental principles of cool They
try it

again Continued ad lib as we hear

SARAH (V0O)
Watching John with the machine it was suddenly
so clear The Terminator would never stop it
would never leave him it would always be
there And it would never hurt him never shout
at him or get drunk and hit him or say it
couldnt spend time with him because it was too
busy And it would die to protect him Of all
the would-be fathers who came and went over the
years this thing this machine was the only
one who measured up In an insane world it was
the sanest choice

Sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work a
strong woman
made hard and cold by years of hard choices

A110 EXT ROAD - DAY

A police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet empty road
on the

outskirts of Los Angeles A ribbon of traffic moves steadily
by ona

freeway in the distance Nothing stirs around the cruiser
except some

pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it

Alll IN THE CRUISER The T-1000 sits inside Johns notes and
letters are
spread out on the seat beside it Sarahs voice speaks from a
cassette deck Johns tapes Her voices mixes with the
static filled
chatter of the radio that T-1000 monitors for any signs of its
targets

SARAH
if we are ever separated and cant make
contact go to Enriques airstrip Ill
rendezvous with you there

T-1000 whips around and rewinds the tape replaying the last
section
It then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier

ECU on envelope We see the postmark Charon Mesa Calif

TIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope It
glances

up at the sound of crunching gravel In the rear-view it sees
a BIKE

COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it The big KAWASAKI
1100 idles

up next to the T-1000 still seated in the cruiser
BIKE COP
Howdy I saw you pulled over here earlier
Everything okay

Sarah sits at the picnic table The weapons are cleaned and

the weight of the whole world on her shoulder

She draws her knife from its belt sheath

Idly starts to carve something on the table top the letter

A114 NOT FAR AWAY John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for
the trip
A115 ON SARAH AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving
thinking

She watches Salcedas kids playing nearby wrestling with a
mutty

dog and loving it Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler
by her

hands Backlit stylized She looks over at John Loading
guns and

supplies
A116 ANGLE ON kids playing
A117 SARAHS HEAD droops She closes her eyes

A118 TIGHT ON small children playing Different ones
Wider now to reveal a playground in a park Very idyllic A
dream

playground crowded with laughing children playing on swings
slides

and a jungle gym It could be the playground we saw melted
and frozen

in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029 But here the grass is
vibrant

green and the sun is shining

118A Sarah short-haired looking drab and paramilitary stands
outside the
playground An outsider Her fingers are hooked in a chain-

link

fence and she is staring through the fence at the young
mothers

playing with their kids A grim-faced harbinger
118B Some girls play skip-rope Their sing-song weaves through the
random

burbling laughter of the kids One of the young mothers walks
her

two-year-old son by the hands She is wearing a pink waitress

uniform She turns to us laughing

It is Sarah Beautiful Radiant Sarah from another life

uncontaminated by the dark future She glances at the strange
woman

beyond the fence
118C Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence She starts

shouting at

them in SLOW MOTION No sound comes from her mouth She
grabs the

fence in frustration shaking it Screaming soundlessly

Waitress Sarahs smile falls Then returns as her little boy
throws

some sand at her She laughs turns away as if the woman at
the

fence were a shadow a trick of light

118D-118F OMITTED

1186 THE SKY EXPLODES The children ignite like match heads
Sarah is

burning screaming silently everything silent and
overexposed

118H THE BLAST WAVE HITS devouring the cowering mothers and
children

Sarahs scream merges with the howl of the wind as the
shockwave rips

into her blasting her apart and she
119 Wakes up

All is quiet and normal The children are still playing
nearby Less

than fifteen minutes have gone by

Bathed in sweat Sarah sits hunched over the table

Every muscle is shaking She is gasping

Sarah struggles to breathe running her hand through her hair
which is

soaked with sweat She can escape from the hospital but she

cant

escape from the madness which haunts her

She looks down at the words she has carved on the table amid
the

scrawled hearts and bird-droppings They are NO FATE

Something changes in her eyes She slams her knife down in
the table

top embedding it deeply in the words Then gets up suddenly
and

we --

rifle

behind the seat of their stolen pickup jump in and start it

Never mind Okay the whole thing goes The
future is not set There is no fate but what

TERMINATOR
She intends to change the future somehow

JOHN

TERMINATOR
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war

JOHN
I dont care Theres gotta be another way
Havent you learned anything Havent you

sees him working at his terminal Danny puts a finger to his

lips

shushing Blythe His expression is mischievous
129B With the silencer in place Sarah eases back the bolt and then
slips

it forward chambering a 223 round Then she lies down on
the

embankment

He cheek pressed against the cool rifle-stock she slides one
hand

slowly forward to brace the weapon taking the weight on her
elbow

Her other hand slips knowingly to the trigger

Her expression is cold impassive She looks through the
scope at the

his head

The laser dot jiggles on the back of Dysons neck and then

rises

centering on the back of his skull

Thump It hits Dysons foot He jerks startled and looks
down

as --

POP
132B His monitor screen is BLOWN OUT spraying his with glass He
jerks

back utterly shocked and spins to see the huge hole blown
through

the window behind him This saves him as K-THUMP -- the

second shot

blows the top of his high-backed chain into an explosion of
stuffing

an inch from his head

Instinctively he dives to the carpet as --

BLAM BLAM BLAM -- rounds blast through the window tearing
into his

desk and computer blowing his keyboard into shrapnel
132C With the monitor screen blown out the room is in darkness
Sarah

cant see Dyson now down behind his desk She puts round
after round
into the heavy desk blasting one side of it into kindling

132D Dyson scared out of his mind has his face jammed against the
carpet
terrified to move He sees his kids in the hall

DYSON
Run kids Go Run

132E IN THE HALL TARISSA rounds the corner at a dead run She
sees the

kids running toward her and grabs them in her arms Down the
hall

in the dark study she sees Dyson on the floor amid the
splinters and
shrapnel of the continuing fusillade

TARISSA
Miles Oh my God

MILES
Stay back

132F ON THE FLOOR Dyson flinches as chucks of wood and shattered
computer

components shower down on him He looks desperately toward
the door

but knows hed be totally exposed Hed never make it

133 SARAHs rifle empties with a final CLACK

She throws it down and draws her 45 smoothly from a shoulder
base

She starts toward the house snapping back the slide on the
pistol

chambering a round She is in a fast purposeful walk
keeping her

eyes fixed on the target She is utterly determined to kill
this man

134 FROM UNDER THE DESK Dyson can see a sliver in the backyard
He sees

Sarahs feet as she strides toward him He tenses to make a
break for

the door

Sarah raises the pistol eyes riveted ahead controlling her

breathing Dyson springs up in a full-tilt sprint She
tracks him

He hooks a foot on the cord of a toppled disk drive

BOOM Her shot blows apart a lamp where his head was

He hits the floor hard but keeps moving scrambling forward

Crunch of glass behind his as Sarahs dark form is framed in

the

blown-out floor-to-ceiling window Dyson leaps toward the
hall

BOOM Her second shot spins him He hits the floor in the
hallway

Tarissa is screaming Dyson struggles forward stunned
There is a

-45-caliber hole clean through his left shoulder He smears
the wall

with blood as he staggers up Looking back he sees the
implacable

figure behind him coming on

He topples through a doorway as --
BOOM BOOM Shots blowing away the molding where he just

was

SARAH
Dont fucking move Dont FUCKING MOVE
(she swings the gun on
Tarissa)
Get on the floor bitch Now Fucking down
Now
Sarah is crazy-eyed now shaking with the intensity of the
moment

The kill has gone bad with screaming kids and the wife
involved

things she never figured on Tarissa drops to the knees
terrified

as she looks into the muzzle of the gun Blythe runs to Dyson
and
hugs him wailing

BLYTHE
Dont hurt my father

SARAH
(screaming)
Shut up kid Get out of the way

Dyson looks up through his pain and incomprehension Why is

this
nightmare happening The black gun muzzle is a foot from his
face
DYSON
(gasping)
Please let the kids go
SARAH
Shut up SHUT UP Motherfucker Its all
your fault TS YOUR FAULT
We see her psyching herself to pull the trigger needing now
to hate
this man she doesnt know Its a lot harder face-to-face
She is
bathed in sweat and it runs into her eyes Blinking she
wipes it
fast with one hand then gets it back on the gun The 45 is
trembling
TIGHT ON SARAH as we see the forces at war behind her eyes
She looks into the faces of Dyson Tarissa Blythe Danny
Sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms
contract
as she tenses to fire
But her finger wont do it
She lowers the gun very slowly It drops to her side in one
hand
All the breath and energy seems to go out of her
She weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture like
Stay
where you are dont move As if should they move the
fragile
balance might tip back the other way
She backs away from them slowly panting Its as if shes
backing
away in terror from what she almost did She reaches a wall
and
slumps against it Slides down to her knees The gun falls
limply
from her fingers
She rests her cheek against the wall

Terminator steps inside John grabs his sleeve and pushes

past him
He scopes out the situation in two seconds Sarah the gun

look at

JOHN
Mom You okay
SARAH
I couldnt oh God
(she seems to she him for
the first time)
You came here to stop me
JOHN
Uh huh
She reaches out and takes his shoulder suddenly surprising
him

drawing him to her She hugs him and a great sob wells up
deep inside
her from a spring she had thought long dry She hugs him

fiercely
as the sobs wrack her

John clutches her shoulders It is all he ever wanted

JOHN
ts okay Itll by okay Well figure it
out

SARAH

love you John I always have

JOHN
know Mom I know

TARISSA looks around at the bizarre tableau Terminator has
wordlessly ripped open Dysons shirt and examined the wound

TERMINATOR
Clean penetration No shattered bone
Compression should control the loss of blood

He takes Tarissas hands and presses them firmly over the

entrance and
exit wounds
TERMINATOR
Do you have bandages

DYSON
In the bathroom Danny can you get them for
us

Danny nods and runs down the hall
John disengages from Sarah She wipes her tears the instinct

to
toughen up taking over again But the healing moment has had
its
effect nevertheless
John walks toward Dyson and Terminator
DYSON
Who are you people
John draws the Bikers knife from Terminators boot Hands it
to him
JOHN
Show him
Terminator takes off his jacket to reveal bare arms
John takes Blythe by the hands and leads her down the hall
away

from what is about to happen

136B TIGHT ON TERMINATORS left forearm as the knife makes a deep
cut just
below the elbow In one smooth motion Terminator cuts all

the way

around his arm With a second cut he splits the skin of the
forearm

from elbow to wrist

TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like
a

surgeon rips off a rubber glove It comes off with a sucking
rip

leaving a bloody skeleton

But the skeleton is made of bright metal and is laced with
hydraulic

actuators The fingers are as finely crafted as watch
parts they

flex into a fist and extend Terminator holds it up palm
out in
almost the exact position of the one in the vault at
Cyberdyne

wrenching

terror This is a man ripped out of normal life into their
grim

world His voice is pleading

done yet Jesus How were we supposed to know

Sarah speaks from the shadows behind them Dyson turns to

find her

sees

what they are running from
193G The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker
It is

a strange vista of fire and ice The huge SMELTERS pour out
orange

light and fire from the sides of the huge galley while the
freezing

vapor rolls down the center

193H TIGHT ON THE WRECK A billowing gray cloud Deep inside the
shape

of the cab in visible A FIGURE emerges pulling itself out
It

drops to the floor The hissing boiling river of liquid
nitrogen
flows around its feet

194 The T-1000 staggers moving slowly painfully It has finally
been

affected by something Its feet are freezing to the ground as
it

walks
194A CLINK One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle It

stumbles
forward and --

194B Its other foot snaps off As it catches its balance on the
stump of

its other ankle
194C the whole lower leg shatters at the impact It topples
forward to its

knees

Catches itself on one hand Liquid nitrogen flows around the
hand

Now the hand is stuck to the pavement
194D The T-1000 pulls and CLINK The hand snaps off at the
wrist

It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist For the
first time

we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one

The expression is pain Agony Its mouth opens ina
soundless

scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs across its body
194E And thats the position it freezes in
It has become a statue kneeling in the frozen vapor that
surprised
look of agony frozen on its face

The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate
194F Terminator just beyond the boundary of the cold can see the
T-1000

clearly

He draws his 45 and aims

TERMINATOR
Hasta la vista baby

194G K-POW The single shot blows the T-1000 into a million
diamonds
spraying up into the air They shimmer across the ground for

twenty

feet in all directions

Terminator lowers the gun satisfied

He looks like he needs a vacation
195 JOHN AND SARAH have seen it from the pickup She is in bad
shape

Conscious but very weak He tries the door Its jammed He
kicks

it open

JOHN
Okay Mom we gotta get out now come on
Thats it

He helps her slide down from the seat of the truck Her knees
give

way John has to take a lot of her weight He reaches in and
picks

up the riot gun off the seat They hobble toward --
195A TERMINATOR On his knees he looks into the dissipating cloud
of

vapor The heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid

nitrogen
196 INSERT TIGHT ON THE FLOOR - the T-1000 shards are melting

liquefying Hundreds of drops of mercury spattered across
the floor

Orange light of the enormous black-furnaces dances on liquid
metal

197 TERMINATOR struggles to rise One arm is shattered the hand
smashed

and useless And some leg-servos are damaged He can barely
stand
John and Sarah arrive

TERMINATOR
We dont have much time

JOHN
What

Terminator points John and Sarah watch as --

198 INSERT T-1000 DROPLETS are creeping together Fusing into
larger

blobs These pools shiver and run together soon forming a
central

mass
199 ON JOHN AND SARAH realizing its not over

JOHN
Come on Lets go

Terminator gets one of Sarahs arms over his shoulder and they
go

BEHIND THEM something is moving
200 A HEAD is forming up out of a pool mercury it rises as
shoulders

form hunching up from the liquid mass Half-formed it
turns to
look straight at them

John looks back in new terror as --

The T-1000 rises to man-height It is still in mercury form

but its

features are forming rapidly It takes its first step after
them

Sarah stumbles and they pull her up
201 Terminator himself has a pronounces limp dragging one leg
with a

shattered ankle joint Johns the one pulling straining
driving

them forward They round a corner into --
202 INT AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES

It is a maze of monstrous machinery The heat is tremendous
The air shivers with a pounding roar
Sarah cries out in pain and stumbles again

JOHN
Come on Mom you can do it Come on
They drag her up and stagger on Her leg is bathed in blood

and she

is deathly pale He looks back
203 INT MAIN GALLERY

The T-1000 steps INTO FRAME Fully formed The hell-fire
light

glints on its impassive cop face It walks forward At first
it

seems unaffected by its crystallization but --
203A ANGLE ON ITS HAND as it touches a railing in passing The

railing is

covered with 0OSHA yellow-and-black safety tape

The hand turns yellow and black the color fading to normal by
about

the elbow It rips the hand from the railing with difficulty
There

is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface

203B The T-1000 looks at its yellow-and-black striped hand It
wills the
hand back to normal We see ripples of static or system

noise
moving subtly over the surface of its body Its starting to
glitch
203C TRACKING WITH THE T-1000S FEET With each step the pattern
on the
tile floor invades its lower legs Fades as the foot is
lifted

Returns as it is set down The foot is trying to meld with
the floor

The chameleonic function is out of control

The T-1000 is losing it It moves forward searching It
rounds the

corner entering the aisle between the furnaces

204 INT AISLE

Terminator sees the SILHOUETTE closing on them through the
smoky

gleam The T-1000 breaks into loping run when it sees them

Terminator turns to Sarah over John

TERMINATOR
Keep going

John shakes his head no The T-1000 is almost on them

TERMINATOR
RUN

John runs dragging half-carrying Sarah as best he can

She can barely stay conscious Half-running delirious she
stumbles

and drops to her knees John pulls but she cant rise

JOHN
(crying shouting)
Come on you gotta try please Mom Get up

John looks back to see --

204A TERMINATOR trying to load the M-79 With his shattered hand
he can

barely maneuver is last grenade into the breech

T-1000 smacks the weapon out of his hands It clatters to the
floor

The grenade spins across the floor rolling under some
machinery

Terminator lunges slamming the T-1000 against a wall with all
his

weight The battle is joined

204B JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle It is a
cul-de-

sac blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER
CRUCIBLE

They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette backlit by
the

molten sparks falling from the furnaces above The battle
which will

decide their fate

204C Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force
against

the opposite wall of the narrow alley In less time than it
would

take to turn the
204D T-1000 morphs trough itself front to back face emerging
from the

back of its head
204E It comes off the wall straight at Terminator who smashes his
good

fist into its face The pile-driver blow buries Terminators
fist

almost to the elbow
204F But the T-1000s head morphs in a split-second into a hand

which grips
Terminators wrist and the head emerges somewhere else the
geometry shifting faster than we can follow
204G The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine jamming his
arm into

the moving works A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM
smashing it

into junk at the elbow pinning him in the machine

Terminator strains against the machine pinning him We hear
his

servos whining with overload The T-1000 turns and lopes
toward Sarah

and John

Sarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines

He

falls into a maze of pipes and girders
205 INT MAZE OF MACHINES

JOHN turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap She
could

follow him but she doesnt SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward
him

John gasps as a huge steel counterweight driven by a chain 6
inches

thick slides toward him He rolls out of the way When he
looks

back he cannot see the opening

JOHN
Mom MOMMM

206 INT AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES

TERMINATOR strains to reach a 6-foot steel bar lying near him
Steel

workers use them to move the red-hot ingots around He gets
hold of

the end and uses it as a lever With titanic effort he
spreads the

massive components which are holding him and withdraws him
arm which

is severed at the elbow Dangling junk hands from the crushed

joint
207 SARAH has lost sight of John It is much of a goodbye as they
will

have

She turns as the T-1000 closes on her She is half-slumped
against

the sooty machines looking barely conscious She struggles
to load
a shell into the empty weapon At the last instant she whips

up the

RIOT GUN and FIRES
A207 T-1000s face is blown open but quickly reforms as it closes
on her

She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but --
A208 THUNK A steel needle slams through her shoulder pinning
her

The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand The index
finger

extends as a gleaming needle toward her eye --

T-1000
Call to John Now

207C WHAM SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force
that is

cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval The 6-foot
steel

bar is imbedded in its body Terminator hurls the killer off
Sarah
207D The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him
with

fury

Swinging again and again Hammering Terminator back
Terminator

falls back against the wall

Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam hanging from two
chains It

is used to lift ingots into the smelters and it runs ona
linear

track
207E The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track

Straight at

Terminator The two-ton girder smashes into his chest

crushing the

armor

The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back and then heaves it forward
again

Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder
We hear

metal crush and break inside him He sags turning to grip
the

wall

The third blow slams into his back smashing his spine and
pelvis We

hear servos ratcheting and failing He drops to his knees
crucified

on a wall of machinery
The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades
Sound of

crushing metal His skull is partially caved in

He slides to the floor

207F ON THE T-1000 emotionless as it walks forward
207G TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor He is trying to
crawl

feebly

Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine
His arm

stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself
forward His

exposed machine eye burns red with determination

We see his prize He has the M-79 with the breech still

open
cradled in the crook of his ruined arm He good hand the
exposed
steel one is reaching for the last grenade which is visible
under

the skirt of the massive smelter base His metal fingers
reach out
for it as --

207H The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs
it down

with unbelievable force It punches into Terminators back
through a

gap in the shattered armor The T-1000 levers it back and
forth

widening the hole Then is raises the pointed bar again and
slams it

down

It punches right through Emerging from Terminators chest

And into the floor He is pinioned The cyborg sags face
down and

stop moving The light goes out of his eye

CuT TO
208 INT MAZE OF MACHINERY

John scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter
Above him

vast machines churn untended He hears a voice SARAHS

Calling low and urgent to him

SARAH
John John Can you hear me Where are you
208A He crawls out of the shadows

Onto a landing next to one of the SMELTER CRUCIBLES Molten
steel

glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace Heat
shimmers

the air giving everything a hallucinatory quality

John sees Sarah nearby limping toward him She can barely
move her
leg bathed in blood He runs toward her

SARAH
(gasping)
Help me honey

TIGHT ON SARAH her stoic face as she hobbles forward
reaching out
to him Something rises behind her OUT OF FOCUS

209 ANOTHER IDENTICAL SARAH but this one has a shotgun
Aimed right at us

209A JOHN freezes Which is which He looks down The first
Sarahs

feet are melded with the floor sucking and fusing with the
tiles as

she walks They have the color and pattern of the tiles up to

the
knee
SARAH
John get out of the way
JOHN
(screaming)
SHOOT
209B John dives aside The Sarah-form spins changing into you-

know-who

Sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it BOOM It
staggers back

K-CHAK She chambers another round BOOM It staggers

again

K-CHAK BOOM And again And again
209C The T-1000 is blown back a step and Sarah advances with each
shot

The craters in the T-1000s body heal slowly Its power is
waning

She FIRES again And again Her eyes blazing with feral
intensity
She walks it back right to the edge of the pit of MOLTEN
STEEL

K-CHAK CLICK Shes empty The T-1000 is right at the
edge Ina
second it will recover its composure as its crater hits close

slowly
She has failed Now it will kill them both
Except
210 CLOSEUP TERMINATOR as the chain drive brings it into view

Half human flesh half chrome steel
His red eye gazes right at us as he --
FIRES

210A The T-1000 takes the round in the belly The grenade EXPLODES
inside
its body A huge hole is blown clean through it and it is

ripped

open and peeled back half inside-out It topples into the
molten

steel and --
211 The T-1000s head and upper body reappear above the molten
steel

It is screaming A terrifying inhuman siren of a scream

It is changing morphing transforming into anything and
everything

its ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it --

We catch a glimpse of Janelle Voight checkered with the
linoleum tile

colors Lewis the Guard with knives exploding from his face
other

faces switching at a stroboscopic rate now a face every
two frames

until they merge into one face --

The T-1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten

steel
We see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the
superheated surface until it vanishes swirling into
nothing
212 JOHN runs to Sarah She stands staring into the pit The
empty

shotgun slips from her fingers Clatters to the floor He
sees that
shes okay and he runs to the fallen Terminator

212A The crippled cyborg is trying to rise Its servos whine and
stutter
It pathetically lifts itself to a kneeling position
collapses

tries again

John lifts for all hes worth Sarah joins them helping

The help the crippled machine get on its feet It can barely
stand

TERMINATOR
I need a vacation

They walk to the edge of the pit Terminator looks down and
sees
that it is over

JOHN
(to Terminator)
Is it dead

TERMINATOR
Terminated

John unzips Sarahs backpack and takes out the hand of the
first
terminator

JOHN
Will it melt in there

TERMINATOR
Yes Throw it in

He does It sinks into the lava Vanishes

TERMINATOR
And the chip

John takes it out of his pocket Looks at it Tosses it into
the
smelter

SARAH
Its finally over

TERMINATOR
No There is another chip

He touches a metal finger to the side of his head

TERMINATOR
And it must be destroyed also

John suddenly understands what he means
Terminator looks at Sarah They both know what must be done
John shakes his head

JOHN
No
TERMINATOR
Im sorry John
JOHN
No no no Itll be okay Stay with us
TERMINATOR

I have to go away John

JOHN
Dont do it Please dont go --

Tears are streaming down his face

TIGHT CLOSEUP TERMINATOR turning toward John
The human side of his face is in shadow so we see mostly the
chrome

skull and the red eye

TERMINATOR
It must end here or I am the future

JOHN
I order you not to

Terminator puts his hand on Johns shoulder He moves
slightly and

the human side of his face comes into the light

He reaches toward Johns face His metal finger touches the
tear

trickling down his cheek

TERMINATOR

I know now why you cry But it is something I

can never do
(to both of them)

Goodbye

Sarah looks at Terminator Reaches out her hand to shake it
They lock eyes Warriors Comrades

SARAH
Are you afraid

TERMINATOR
Yes
He turns and steps off the edge

213 They watch him sink into the lava

He disappears the metal hand sinking last at the last
second it

forms into a fist with the thumb extended a final thumbs
up

Then it is gone

214 HOLD ON JOHN AND SARAH watching through the heat ripples as
we --

DISSOLVE TO

215 THE SUN PURE IN A CLOUDLESS SKY

Tilting down reveal that we are in a park very green People
are

casually dressed having fun Cycling reading children
are

playing in a playground

Beyond the line of tree we see the skyline of Washington
DC with
the Capital Building and the Washington Monument The skyline

is
subtly changed with a lot of new buildings advanced high-
rises
A CARD APPEARS
July 11 2029
WE BOOM DOWN AND TRACK LATERALLY through a playground in the
foreground Children swinging on swings Sliding down
slides
Timeless things that 4 decades of technical advancement will
not
change As we track we hear
SARAH (V0O)
August 29th 1997 came and went Nothing much
happened Michael Jackson turned forty There
was no Judgment Day People went to work as
they always do laughed complained watched
TV made love
We pass a jungle gym neither melted nor burned but full of
kids
swinging and yelling raucously Past it we drop down to see a
boy

pumping the pedals of a tricycle

SARAH (VO)
I wanted to run down the street yelling to
grab them all and say Every day form this day
is a gift Use it well Instead I got drunk

STILL TRACKING we come to rest on an elderly woman seated on a
bench

It is SARAH now 64 years old The world has aged her but
she seems

at peace in this moment She speaks into a microcassette
recorder

SARAH (V0O)
That was thirty years ago But the dark future
which never came still exists for me and it
always will like the traces of a dream lingering
in the morning light And the war against the
machines goes on Or to be more precise the
war against those who build the wrong machines

There is a man in is forties playing with two small children

nearby He turns It is John Connor Through he has the
same stern

features in adulthood there is no eye-patch no scarring He

is far
from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that
might
have been But there is still penetrating intelligence even
wisdom
in his eyes
SARAH (V0O)
John fights the war differently than it was
foretold Here on the battlefield of the
Senate the weapons are common sense and
hope
A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL runs to her to have her shoelace tied
GIRL
Tie me grandma
Grandma Sarah smiles It is the only time we have seen her
smile so
far She bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the
bench

She ties as we hear

SARAH (V0O)
The luxury of hope was given to me by the
Terminator Because if a machine can learn
the value of human life maybe we can too
Sarah ruffles the kidss hair as she runs off to play with her
dad

FADE OUT
