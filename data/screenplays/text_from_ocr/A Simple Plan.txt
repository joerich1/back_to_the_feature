INT FEED MILL - DAY

The air is thick with dust Grain is being milled a loud
steady GRINDING WE SEE the machinery moving in the shifting
light Shelves line one wall sagging with burlap sacks HANK
MITCHELL is tallying the bags on a clipboard Hes thirty years
old slim light-haired dressed in khakis and a sweater

EXT FEED MILL - DAY

A tall narrow building roofed with corrugated tin Its
separated from the feedstore by a barren snow-covered yard
The snow is dirty pockmarked with tracks We still HEAR the
grinding but its more muffled now

The mills door opens and Hank emerges clutching his
Glipboard He coughs spits into the snow then picks his way
quickly toward the feedstore slapping at his sweater and pants
as he goes leaving a cloud of dust in the air behind hin

INT HANKS OFFICE DAY

A tiny office which Hank shares with his boss TOM BUTLER The
bookshelves are crowded with files the desks are messy a
fluorescent light flickers on the ceiling Butler a heavyset
man approaching forty is talking on the phone no words just
an intermittent string of HMMMs UH-HUHs and UNH-UNHs

Hank enters plucks the top sheet of paper from his clipboard
deposits it on Butlers desk Butler scans its columns without
pausing in his conversation As Hank sits down at his own
slightly smaller desk his watch BEEPS He fumbles with it
checking the time its noon

Hank hurriedly shuts his briefcase turns off his desk lamp
When he steps to the door and pulls down his coat Butler
glances at his own watch raising his eyebrows the phone still
pressed to his ear Hank hesitates halfway into his overcoat

HANK
The cemetery

(Butlers face remains blank)
My brother and I

Butler nods suddenly remembering and waves Hank away Hank
rushes out the door It SLAMS shut then immediately pops back
open as Hank sticks his head in

RANK (contd)
Happy New Year

fig

Before Butler can respond the door shuts and Hank is gone
EXT SMALL TOWN MAIN ST - DAY

A small worn-looking town The street is lined with two-story
buildings their paint peeling gutters sagging The few people
out and about are dressed heavily against the cold Snow has
been shoveled into long piles along the sidewalks edge Wind-
tattered Christmas decorations cling to the light poles

Hank emerges from the feedstore buttoning his overcoat He
turns to the right hurrying his head ducked against the cold

MOVING

We follow Hank down the block He passes a woman carrying a
bulging grocery bag a SMALL CHILD trailing behind her
androgynous in its snow gear The womans name is LINDA
HANK
Happy New Year Linda
(to the child)
Happy New Year Marcil

The mother and daughter both RESPOND their faces too muffled by
their scarves for us to make out their words

HANK walks on passing a tavern several stores the library
all of the buildings look equally rundown Only the town hall
Stands out in any way a red-brick structure with a police truck
parked on the street before it CARL JENKINS the town
policeman a white-haired vigorous-looking old man is scraping
the trucks windshield He waves at Hank

CARL
Happy New Year Hank

As Hank waves back a little girl glides toward him down the
sidewalk perched on a sled silent almost magical Hank
steps aside to let her pass Then he turns the corner starts
down the next block He stops at--

THE MITCHELL HOUSE

--which is just a bit less dilapidated than its neighbors an
essentially rundown building with a thin facade of renovation
fresh paint clean windows a wreath on the door Christmas
lights blink on the porch railings Hank climbs the steps
vanishes inside the door SLAMMING shut behind him

END CREDITS
INT MITCHELL ENTRANCEWAY —- DAY

Hank pauses inside the door unbuttoning his coat To his right
is the dining room to his left the living room Nothings
expensive but all the furnishings have obviously been chosen
with care A poinsettia sits on a table by the front door

Hank drapes his coat over the bannister bends to remove his
shoes then stops listening WE HEAR water running and--too
faintly to make out the words--a woman singing Hank yanks off
his shoes starts quickly up the stairs

INT MITCHELL BEDROOM —- DAY

A bed night tables a pair of bureaus Photographs dot the
walls the windows look out onto the street A door cracked
open leads to a bathroom This is where the waters coming
from Hanks wife SARAH is singing in the shower We can
HEAR her words now Shes singing In the Bleak Midwinter

Hank enters moves to the bathroom door Very slowly he pushes
it open steps into--

THE MITCHELL BATHROOM

A sink toilet and tub Everything shines whitely except for
the shower curtain which is bright red Behind it Sarah
continues to SING her voice hauntingly pretty Hank stands in
the center of the room perfectly silent listening

After a few beats the singing stops and the water is turned
off Then the shower curtain is slowly pulled open revealing--

SARAH

--who like her voice is hauntingly pretty She flinches at
the sight of Hank startled hiding behind the shower curtain
It clings to her body betraying the huge dome of her belly
shes extremely pregnant After a moment she smiles and Hank
grabs a towel steps forward with it holding it out to her
Neither of them says a word

INT MITCHELL BEDROOM - DAY

Hank is knotting his tie in front of the mirror hes changed
into a dark suit Sarah stands behind him adjusting his
collar HUMMING the Christmas carol Shes wearing a bathrobe
her hair is still wet She brushes at Hanks jacket

From downstairs WE HEAR a sudden pounding Sarah steps to the
window peers out

The POUNDING resumes as Hank comes down the stairs He grabs

Jacob shrugs not looking at his brother
JACOB

I thought we could take him after
Hank looks as if hes about to protest more strongly but then

he checks himself He sighs reaches back inside for the
poinsettia then shuts the door and leads Jacob down the steps
EXT COUNTRY CEMETERY - DAY WW

A small graveyard behind a ramshackle church surrounded by open
fields Snow covers everything Jacobs truck idles in the
churchs lot His dog sits in back pressed against the rear
windshield which has been replaced with a sheet of plastic

Hank and Jacob trudge toward the center of the cemetery Hank
is carrying the poinsettia They stop before a gravestone
Jacob stoops to wipe it clear of snow revealing an inscription

Jacob Hansel Mitchell Josephine McDonnell Mitchell
June 2 1930 May 5 1933
December 31 1990 December 31 1990

Beneath this are two blank spots for Hank and Jacob The men
stand for a beat heads bowed The dog watches from the rear of
the truck ears erect

After a moment Hank kneels to place the poinsettia before the
grave He scoops out a little crevice for it in the snow

inadvertently excavating the frozen remains of a potted
chrysanthemum Hank stares at it in surprise then up at Jacob

HANK
Somebody else was here

JACOB
I brought it

Hank seems to have trouble accepting this idea

The explosive sound of FLAPPING WINGS WE SEE a chicken coop

away scampering over the wooden fence The windows of the
Pederson house are blanks no ones home

its paws throwing up a wake of snow On the horizon WE SEE a
dark mass of trees The fox is heading straight for them

Lou has managed to open the bag WE SRE him look inside with an
expression of stunned amazement He reaches in touches
whatevers there Neither Hank nor Jacob notices his reaction

Well have to lead them to the-—

Lou
Jacob
Jacob turns)
Look

He tilts the bag It’s filled with hundred dollar bills
packets held together with paper bands The three men stand in
shocked silence not even noticing when the dog reappears
wading down through the snow on the Opposite slope Finally
Lou starts to GIGGLE He bends his head into the bag kisses
the money then looks up at the other two ecstatic

LOU (cont’d)
Can you believe this

Hank steps forward to look more closely Jacob glances from him
to Lou bewildered °

JACOB
Its real

LOU
Of course it’s real Dont be stupid

He plucks out a packet tosses it to Jacob Jacob catches it
staring in wonder Lou jumps up pumped with excitement

( )

27 Hank shakes his head he finds the prospect preposterous

LOU (contd)
(with sudden venom)
Stay the hell out of it then we dont
need you It just means more money for us

HANK
I dont want to stump you with another
fancy word but does the term accomplice
mean anything to you

Jacob tries to intercede before Lou can reply

Hank is

JACOB
Why would we get caught

HANK
It’s a lot of money Jacob Someone has to
be looking for it And when they find the
plane and its not inside-

LOU
Thats bullshit That guys gotta be a
drug dealer or something As far as the
policere concerned this doesnt even
exist Nobody knows about it but us

JACOB
(nodding enthusiastically)
Like lost treasure

obviously unconvinced Lou turns to Jacob disgusted

LOU
Your fucking brother--its the American
dream and he just wants to walk away from
it

HANK
You work for the American dream Lou You
dont steal it

Lou
Then this is even better

JACOB
(jumping in insistent)
It’s drug money Hank Its not stealing

LOU
How about this
(lifting out a packet)
(MORE)

LOU (contd)
I‘ii bet you ten thousand dollars that when
they find the plane theres no mention of
the money

He holds the packet toward Hank Hank peers down at it When
he doesnt take it Lou tosses it at him It smacks Hank in the
chest he catches it as it bounces off
LOU (contd)

Why give it up before we even know if

someones looking for it
ON HANK as he stares down at the money hefting it in his palin
The other men watch him waiting Hank opens his mouth to
speak but then stops hesitating trying to make his way
through this new territory struggling to discern a path
Finally slowly as if he were merely thinking out loud

HANK
What if I was the one to keep it

JACOB
All of it

HANK
Just till spring Till someone finds the
plane

LOU
And then

HANK
If youre right and nobody mentions the
money we can split it up and move away
LOU
Why should you get to hold it
HANK
Thats the only way Ill do it Otherwise
we Can turn it in right now
Jacob gives his brother a quizzical look

JACOB
You dont trust us

Rank hesitates weighing the merits of a truthful answer Then

I guess I dont

Jacob nods He doesnt seem surprised Hank turns to Lou

( )

HANK (cont’d)
No promises If it looks like anyones
searching for the money Ill burn it and
thatll be that

Jacob and Lou stare at each other silently debating Finally
Jacob shrugs tossing his packet back into the bag

LOU
(threatening)
We count it first
Hank and Lou lock eyes for a moment Then Hank nods

HANK
Thats probably a good idea

EXT EDGE OF ROAD - DUSK
Jacobs truck is repositioned at side of the road The three
men stand behind it WE SEE the packets lined up on the
tailgate forty-four stacks of ten The three men stare down at
them mesmerized Very faintly WE HEAR a car approaching

Hank stares at his brother speechless with surprise and horror
INT JACOBS TRUCK - NIGHT - MOVING 39
Hank sits between Jacob and Lou his legs hugging the duffel
bag He keeps glancing out the torn rear window making sure
they arent being pursued
HANK
(scared and angry)
Ive seen you do a lot of stupid things
Jacob but that pretty much takes the cake

Before Jacob can respond Lou jumps to his defense

Lou
It was my idea

HANK
Well thats brilliant Lou If they find
the plane now and they realize the moneys
gone he’s gonna know right off who took
it

Jacob shakes his head grinning

JACOB
That‘s the beauty of it There’s no way
we’d have mentioned it if we were the ones
who took the money

LOU
Its not like we told him you actually saw
plane going down Just that you thought
you heard one with engine trouble I dont
really think--

HANK
(furious )
You want me to burn the money

The other two men are mite intimidated by his rage

HANK (cont’d)
Im not going to jail for this Lou If it
looks like theres even the slightest
chance of us getting caught I swear to
God its all gonna vanish You
understand

Again silence The torn plastic makes a flapping sound behind
their heads Finally Lou throws Jacob a little smirk

Lou
(whispering)

Its a pilliliineapple

He and Jacob begin to GIGGLE Hank glances from one to the

other still angry and--with no small effort--they manage to
stop laughing

and you found a bag full of money--maybe I
dont know

(he pretends to think)
Four million dollars Would you keep it

Sarah gives him a funny look half-smiling half-wary

SARAH
Of course not

The pot begins to boil over on the stove Sarah jumps to turn
it down Hank stares after her astonished

HANK
How come

Sarah resumes her stirring

SARAH
Well for starters itd be stealing

Hank shakes his head standing up growing animated this is a
reservation hes sure he can appease

HANK
Were talking about lost money here
Nobodys looking for it

SARAH
Four million dollars and no ones looking
for it

(Hank nods emphatically)

Then whose money is it

HANK
What do you mean Its yours

Sarah opens the oven bends to check on the bread

SARAH
But whose was it before

The question seems to stump Hank He has to think for a moment

HANK
A bank robbers

SARAH
Then its the banks money

33AR 33

Hank throws up his hands in impatience

HANK
All right its a drug dealers

Sarah stirs the pot considering this Its clear that shes
searching for a reason not to take a drug dealers money

SARAH
This is so silly Hank

Hank gives her a long look of disappointment which she doesnt
seem to notice Then he turns and strides from the room Sarah
continues to stir oblivious of his departure

SARAH (contd)
to the empty room)
I mean it doesnt matter where its from
I wouldnt take it
(a pause)
Its just wrong Thats all that--

Hank returns dragging the duffel bag He pours the money into
a massive pile across the table packets sliding off and
dropping to the floor Then he turns to Sarah a huge grin on
his face Shes staring open-mouthed at the money

HANK
It’s real

Sarah looks almost pained She reaches behind herself drops
the spoon onto the stove touches her hand to her forehead

HANK AND SARAH - LATER 335A

seated at the kitchen table eating dinner-spaghetti garlic
bread green beans milk The money is piled messily on the
floor beside them They keep glancing at it while they eat

HANK
If we keep it well never have to worry
about money again

SARAH
We don’t have to worry about money now
Hank You’ve got a good job We don’t
need this

Hank lets this go He stares down at the money chewing his
food thinking searching for another approach

HANK
Nobody gets hurt by our keeping it

Hank is washing the dishes while Sarah dries them and puts them
away The money is still lying on the floor but it’s been
organized into stacks now A TV is playing on the counter

HANK (contd)
That’s what makes it a crime isn’t it
People getting hurt

He turns off the water Sarah begins to dry the last pot

SARAH
(impatient)
What makes it a crime is that its against
the law It doesnt matter whether anybody
gets hurt or not You get caught and you
go to jail

HANK
But you aren’t listening to me The
money’s the only evidence that we’ve done
anything wrong We can sit on it and see
what happens-—

A COMMERCIAL is playing on the TV and both it and Hank’s
dialogue roll over into the next scene

INT HANK’S FAMILY ROOM — LATER 33C

Hank and Sarah sit on the couch in front of a larger TV
They’re sipping sparkling cider The money is back in its bag
which sits across the room now leaning up against the doorway

HANK (contd)
--if someone comes searching for it well
burn it and that‘’ll be that There’s no
risk well always be in complete control

On TV the commercial ends and a New Year’s Eve show comes on--
there are shots of Times Square frenzied crowds the gold bali
SARAH
What about Jacob and Lou
HANK
As long as were the ones holding the
money theyll do whatever we tell them to

On the TV the countdown is just starting the ball begins its
descent Hank and Sarah don’t seem to notice

33C 33c

SARAH
And your tracks in the snow They lead in
from the road right to the plane then
back out again

HANK
It’s supposed to snow tomorrow The
tracks1l be gone by tomorrow night

The New Year arrives--FIRECRACKERS COWBELLS On the TV a swing
band strikes up AULD LANG SYNE Sarah lifts her glass and Hank
returns the gesture but distractedly merely out of reflex

HANK
We can always burn the money Right up to
the very last moment It seems Silly to
just give it up now before anything’s even
gone wrong

33D BENEATH THE BED — LATER 33D
A CU of the duffel bag stuffed beneath the bed ‘The bed is

creaking a bit and WE HEAR Hank and Sarah making love We move
UPWARD until WE SEE

HANK AND SARAH

Sarah is crouched over Hank his hands are on her breasts They
both seem to be deeply involved in what theyre doing but then
suddenly Sarah freezes

SARAH
You have to go back and return some of it
A lot like five hundred thousand

It takes Hank a moment to focus in on what she’s saying

HANK
What

SARAH
That way when they find the plane they11
assume no one’s been there yet It’ll put

us beyond suspicion No one would walk
away from that much money

HANK
(still a little dazed)
We’re gonna keep the rest

kisses his cheek

SARAH

have to be from now on We have to be
thinking ahead all the time

She begins moving up and down again Hank responds accordingly
though he seems distracted his thoughts far away

INT APARTMENT LANDING DAY 33E

Hank stands at the top of a dingy dimly lit stairway pounding
on a Closed door There’s no answer Hank pounds again louder
this time

HANK
Come on Jacob Open up

He pushes at the front of his jacket There’s a definite bulge
there which he tries to shift a bit with his hand Hes still
working at it when the door opens He quickly drops his hand

Jacob blinks out at us His face is puffy his hair uncombed
He’s wearing long johns and a too-small T-shirt Behind him we
glimpse a small sparsely furnished extremely dirty studio
with a scraggly Christmas tree in the corner

Hank glances anxiously down the stairs He puts his hands in
his jacket pockets pushing out trying to hide the bulge

HANK
(whispering)
I moved the pilot We gotta go put him
back like he was

Jacob gives Hank a bleak stare then coughs raggedly dragging
something up He glances around for something to deposit it

into then just leans out the door and spits into the hall

EXT PARENTS’ FARM - DAY 66

A snow-packed road running through barren fields Hanks car
Stops behind Jacobs truck and he climbs out The ruins of a
house and barn stand on a rise above the road along with a
rusty old windmill WE SEE Jacob sitting on the edge of the
houses porch He stands up waves Hank starts toward him

looking anxious
EXT PARENTS FRONT PORCH DAY 67

Several of the houses windows are shattered the front door is
boarded up The barn’s roof is caving in Jacob is trying to
peer in through one of the windows He turns smiling when he
hears Hank CRUNCHING toward him through the snow Hank stops in
front of the porch raises his hands questioning

BANK
So
Jacob waves from the house to the surrounding fields grinning
JACOB

Im gonna buy it back I’m gonna rebuild
everything-just like it was before Mom and
Dad died

A long sad stare from Hank He SIGHS shaking his head

HANK
You know you cant do that As soon as we
Split up the money we have to leave

Preawmrinresns

Jacob eyes Hank for a beat then moves to the edge of the porch
He peers off toward the windmill when he speaks his voice has
a childish inflection lost and scared

JACOB
You want me to just drive off all alone

Hank doesnt know how to answer this He rubs tiredly at his
face steps up onto the porch beside his brother turns to stare
off across the fields

HANK
Where would you say you got your money

Jacob brightens hes obviously already thought this through

JACOB
We could tell people Sarah inherited some
Nobody around here knows anything about her
family Well say you guys bought the farm
before you left and set me up to run it
(cutting off Hanks protest)

I thought you’d be happy It’s our farm
I’m gonna bring it back

HANK
it’s so hard Jacob You don’t just buy a
farm you have to work it You have to
know about machines and seed and
fertilizers and pesticides and herbicides
and drainage and irrigation and the weather
and the government You don’t know about
any of that You’d end up just like Dad

JACOB
(sharp stepping back)
How do you think he ended up like that

HANK
He had two mortgages riding on the place
There was no way he could keep up--

JACOB
(his voice rising)
Whered the money go You think he just
spent it on the farm

HANK
What else would--

48

JACOB
Why do you think he took the second
mortgage Four years of college Didnt
you ever wonder how he paid for that

Hank seems truly shocked He struggles for some response

HANK
Jacob--

Jacob kicks at the porch railing splintering it

JACOB
I was supposed to get the farm

Hank lifts his hands toward his brother pleading

HANK
Jacob you’ve got the whole world You can
go anywhere you want

JACOB
This is where I want Right here
(he STOMPS his foot)
Home

Hank stares off at the empty fields his shoulders hunched
Then without looking he reaches out touches Jacobs arm the
first sympathetic gesture weve seen him make toward Jacob

Sarah covers the articles The old woman stands across the
room holding a book out toward Sarah Sarah smiles

SARAH
Not yet Mrs Trilling Stephen King

Mrs Trilling frowns at the book unsure Then she moves back
behind the shelves Hank and Sarah hesitate a moment before
they resume their WHISPERED discussion
HANK
I guess it changes things doesn’t it

SARAH

Mrs Trilling COUGHS from behind the shelves Hank and Sarah
freeze glancing up They wait a moment before

SARAH (contd)
I think it’s good we know where it came
from I was beginning to worry that it
might be counterfeit or marked

HANK
It might still be marked

Sarah shakes her head She points toward the articles

SARAH
It says they demanded unmarked money

Hank seems unsure Sarah gives him an impatient look
SARAH (cont’d)

Youre being paranoid Hank Its over

Youre just looking for stuff to worry

about
She shoves the articles into her bag

Lou nods as if in understanding He rubs his hands together
glances around the entranceway

LOU

HANK
The money’s not here And even if it were

Lou rears back in indignation

LOU
Just because you have it doesn’t mean it’s

She examines it with distaste then winds its key A man’s
voice begins to SING “Frere Jacques” Hank stares in surprise

Sarah holds her finger to her lips gestures toward the other
half of the room They both stare at the curtain behind which
the only sign of life is the Tv

SARAH
You and Jacob invite him out for drinks
you get him drunk take him back to his
house and then start joking about
confessing to the police You take turns
pretending to do it-you first Jacob
second Lou last--and when Lou does it you
tape him

Hank starts to LAUGH but then realizes she isn’t joking

HANK
Thats absurd There’s no way it’d work
The baby makes a MEWLING sound Sarah Smiles down at it

Claim he killed Pederson just as easily as
he could claim you did it If you make him
think that Jacob would side with you he’11

life--

Hank reaches up turns off the tape recorder in his pocket

HANK
(firm to Jacob) -
Thats enough

Lou
(shaking his head)
I wanna get to the part where you offer to
testify against us Keep asking me
questions Jake

Jacob takes a swallow of whiskey He seems spent by the whole
episode drained He Grops back on the couch as Hank takes out
the tape recorder and rewinds it Hank presses play sets it on
the table They all stare at it while it replays Lou and
Jacobs DIALOGUE Lou looks utterly bewildered

LOU (contd)
You taped us

Neither Hank nor Jacob answers him When the tape is finished
Hank reaches forward and rewinds it

LOU (contd)
What ‘re you doing Hank

HANK
Its your confession Its you saying how
you killed Dwight Pederson

Lou stares at the tape recorder for a moment realizing finally
what it’s for He sneers at Hank

( )

CONTINTJED Lou
Nobody’s gonna believe that thing It’s
obvious I’m just kidding around

HANK
If you and I both went into Carl’s tomorrow

school dropout whos proud when people call
him the town drunk Or me Ive got a

A tense moment then Lou tries to grab the tape recorder but
Hank snatches it away returns it to his shirt pocket

Lou

He rises Hank does too Lou scowls at him waves at Jacob

Lou (contd)
Come on Jake

Jacob sags deep into the couch not looking at either of them
JACOB

keep you from hurting him

LOU

JACOB
He’s not gonna use it unless you tell on
him That seems fair don’t it

Lou

Jacob finally looks up

JACOB

Lou clenches his fists his body taut with anger He glares at

Jacob until Jacob looks away then spins and strides toward the
front of the house disappearing down the hallway to the left

Hank heads toward the front door gesturing for Jacob to follow
Jacob hesitates then starts slowly after him a bit wobbly on
his feet As Hank opens the door he glances down the hall

his voice struggling to sound soothing

HANK (cont’d)

(a long pause finally Jacob

manages a nod)
They were fighting okay They were both
drunk and Lou started pushing Nancy
around When we tried to stop him he went
and grabbed his gun and Nancy ran for her
pistol We sprinted out to the truck and
got your rifle but by the time we got back
to the house it was too late Hed
already shot her He was shooting up the
whole place firing into the ceiling the
walls everything And when we stepped

into the doorway he fired at me The shot

went wide so he pumped the gun again and
aimed right at my chest And that’s when
you killed him

He makes a quieting gesture with his hands

Hank comes down another step lowering

He stares at his feet CRACKS his knuckles one after the other

HANK (cont’d)
Well I suppose I can see how it mightve
seemed that way to him

Another pause The policemen exchange a look Hank shifts in
his chair looking right through Carl straining for a solution

Because he did go to the truck alone I
mean I followed him but then when I heard
Nancy get shot I turned back toward the
house I was on the porch when Lou started
to come outside and thats when I turned
to run back down the walk again

(a pause)

Sarah grabs him as he passes before her With one hand she
holds the SCREAMING baby with the other she ‘grips Hanks wrist

SARAH
Youve got to remember how people see you
Youre just a normal guy A nice sweet
normal guy No one would ever believe that
youd be capable of doing what youve done

Hank pulls himself free walks to the window Behind him Sarah
continues to jiggle the SHRIEKING infant Hank shuts his eyes
rests his fingertips ‘against the glass pressing till they grow
white Then he spins back toward Sarah--

EXT SMALL TOWN MAIN ST - DAY

Its late afternoon snowing heavily The street is empty but
lights shine in several windows including Carls office

INT CARLS OFFICE — DAY

Hank Jacob and NEAL BAXTER sit before Carls desk Baxter is a
large crewcut man dressed in a suit and trench coat Carl is
behind his desk His office is neat and spare-a filing
cabinet a nearly empty bookshelf a gun cabinet on the wall

HANK
It was snowing pretty hard so we werent
really sure but it sounded like an engine
coughing on and off We pulled over to
listen but we didn’t hear anything more--
no crash no engine nothing

He watches Baxter write this down When Baxter finishes he
shuts his notebook then glances from brother to brother Jacob
shifts uncomfortably in his seat making it CREAK
CARL
Anything to add Jacob

JACOB
It was probably just a snowmobile

Another moment passes in silence while Baxter continues to
examine them Then he nods at Carl He rises to his feet
sliding his notebook into his jacket Carl stands up too
CARL
Well thanks for stopping by boys
Hank and Jacob both rise quickly elated to be let off so

easily Jacob even sneaks a grin at his brother as they start
to move toward the door But then just before they escape

(

BAXTER
Think you could take us out there

Hank and Jacob look apprehensively back at Baxter

JACOB
To the nature preserve

BAXTER
Have to go in the morning I guess After
the storm passes

HANK
(to Baxter)
Can you tell us what’s going on
128 INT MITCHELL KITCHEN - DUSK

Hank has just come home Hes still wearing his overcoat snow
melting on his shoulders Sarah is washing lettuce at the sink

’ SARAH
Theres no way its from an armored car
robbery ‘
HANK

This isnt a guess Sarah The guy from
the FBI told me where its from

SARAH
But it doesnt make sense The kidnapping
made sense

HANK
Hes searching for a plane full of money
You cant tell me theres more than one of
those around here

Hank pulls a bottle of beer from the refrigerator The stoves
timer BUZZES Sarah opens the oven checks inside WE SEE a
roast chicken not quite done She resets the timer

SARAH
Its hundred dollar bills Hank If it
were an armored car thered be other
denominations Thered be fifties and
twenties and tens

into the hall She waits a beat then rushes after him

MITCHELL FRONT ENTRANCEWAY - DUSK v21

Hank is hanging his overcoat in the hall closet Sarah comes
toward him from the kitchen

SARAH
Did he show you his badge

HANK
Why would he show me his badge

Sarah bolts up the stairs without answering Hank stands there
a moment exasperated then trudges slowly after her

INT MITCHELL BEDROOM - DUSK 122

Hank ENTERS Sarah is digging through her bureaus top drawer
As Hank sits on the bed and starts to remove his shoes she
turns excited the articles about the kidnapping in her hand

SARAH
Its him isnt it The older one Vernon
(she hands him the article)
Hes looking for his brother

WE SEE the kidnappers photographs he does resemble Baxter a
bit though not much Hank shakes his head

HANK
The guy I met today was skinnier He had a
crew cut and no beard

SARAH
Maybe hes lost weight Maybe he cut his
hair and shaved his beard

Hank continues to stare at the article Theyre both growing
impatient with each other their responses are quick sharp

HANK
He wouldnt be coming around like this
its too big a risk

SARAH
Youre telling me that if Jacob took off in
a plane and disappeared with all the money
you wouldnt try to find him -
(a pause)
Think what weve already done to keep it
(MORE)

122 122

SARAH (contd)
What hes doing is nothing compared to
that

Hank drops the article onto the bed

HANK
It doesnt really make a difference does
it No matter who he is I still have to
take him to the plane

SARAH

If we think its him you shouldnt go
HANK

Why not
SARAH

Hell shoot all three of you Hank As
soon as he sees the plane Thats why he
wants you to go so he can eliminate the
witnesses

HANK
But if hes really from the FBI itll look
suspicious if I dont help

As he watches Sarah search for a response WE HEAR the stoves
timer go off It goes on and on but neither of them reacts

123 INT MITCHELL KITCHEN NIGHT 123

Hank and Sarah sit at the table Sarah is serving the chicken
which is noticeably burnt She starts to eat setting aside the
burnt part Hank watches her ignoring his own food Hes
tense overwrought

SARAH

( )

HANK

No matter who this guy is we dont want
Jacob there

Hank starts to protest but Sarah jumps on him before he can

SARAH
What do you want Hank You wanna just
walk out there and get shot by this guy
Im trying to come up with a plan--

HANK
(out of control)
A plan Like the one to take the money
back to the plane and we wind up killing
Pederson Or the one to tape Lou and two
more people end up dying That the sort of
plan youre thinking of

A long strained beat of silence Then with sudden resolution

HANK (contd)
Im gonna take the money back to the plane
(a bewildered look from Sarah)
The snowll cover my tracks By the time--

SARAH
Hank-—

Hank stands up abruptly nearly knocking over his chair He
heads toward the hall leaving his food untouched behind hin

HANK
If we put it back everythingll be just
like it used to be

For a moment Sarah is too astonished to react Then she jumps
up and starts after him

SARAH
(furious)
Thats what you think you want

Butler to retire or die so you can finally

SARAH (contd)
Coming home each evening to this cheap
ugly house with the basement flooding
every spring the furnace breaking down
twice a year those disgusting yellow tiles
on the kitchen floor Is that all itll
take to make you happy

Hank reappears at the top of the stairs He starts down them
dragging the duffel bag behind him

SARAH (contd)
What about Amanda You think she’s gonna
like growing up in somebody elses hand-me-
down clothes Playing with other kids old
toys because we can never afford to buy her
anything new

Hank reaches the bottom of the stairs turns to Sarah a pained
look on his face

HANK
Sarah--

Sarah keeps going ignoring him

SARAH
And me You think I want to spend the rest
of my life stamping due dates on books
Eight hours a day with a fake smile
plastered on my face then home to cook
dinner for you the same meals over and
over casseroles and macaroni and meatloaf
whatever the weeks coupons allow only
splurging for a restaurant on birthdays or
anniversaries and even then watching what
we order skipping the appetizers waiting
till we get home for dessert You think

Hank reaches toward her sounding scared suddenly

HANK

the dead-time now just himself and his dog
all alone in that dirty apartment How

sticks it in his mouth and--

HANK
Stop it

A beat of silence Hank looks at Sarah as if shes just stabbed
him in the chest Sarah remains wrapped within her fury From
outside WE HEAR the wind buffeting the house

- SARAH
(with venomous disgust)
Sounds wonderful doesnt it Everything

out from under him and his jackets too
tight for him to regain control He shoots
tight off the road smack into a tree

Carl SMACKS the wheel and Hank jumps Hes sweating he keeps
pushing at the gun beneath his coat not listening at all

gathered When I ask what happened this
guy from Wisconsin steps forward and says
‘He was doin fine when we first showed up

Jacob stares at him vacantly Hank shakes his arm shouts

HANK (contd)

‘Jacob nods)
Well this is how you get it Right here

things through He looks up at his brother

presses it to his own temple

FREMONT (contd)
been properly trained there are many ways
to detect a liar

Theres a dark red gash across Hanks cheek but the wound has
Stopped bleeding He gives Fremont a frightened look

HANK
I dont--

FREMONT
The shifty eyes of pulp fiction have a
certain basis in fact A wooden or stilted
tone gestures that seem either slightly
robotic or unnecessarily expansive--

Renkins nods in agreement joining in

RENKINS
Details tend to be vague slippery
Sometimes the suspect will cover his mouth
with his hand as he speaks

Fremont rests his palms on the desk leans toward Hank

FREMONT
You notice anything like that from the man
you shot today

Hank still hasnt grasped what the agent is saying He glances
from Renkins to Fremont gives a nervous shake of his head

FREMONT (contd)
He was lying to you Mr Mitchell He
wasnt from the FBI

Hank lifts his hand starts to cover his mouth but then
realizes what he’s doing and quickly lowers it He struggles to
mask his relief to feign confusion

HANK
I don’t understand He said--

Fremont nods he knows what he said
FREMONT
His name was Vernon Bokovsky His brother

was in that crashed plane you found out
there today

HANK
He was looking for his brother

151 151

The words seem to suck everything out of Hank for an instant
he looks as if he might crumple The other two men dont appear
to notice Renkins leans forward opens the bag of money

RENKINS
He was looking for this

He shakes it displaying the money Hank stares unseeing

FREMONT
Bokovsky and his brother were the guys who
kidnapped that McMartin girl last November
You remember The one they shot and dumped
in the lake

RENKINS
Four point four million dollars in ransom

Hank continues to stare into the bag completely absent he
hasnt heard a word theyve said The agents smile at each
other misinterpreting his reaction Renkins reaches into the
bag pulls out a packet holds it out to Bank

RENKINS (contd)
Wanna touch it

Hank blinks up at him too dazed to answer Renkins nods
encouragingly

RENKINS (contd)
Go ahead

Hank finally realizes what the man wants of him He takes the
packet balances it for a moment in his palm then hands it back
to Renkins who returns it to the bag ‘

RENKINS (contd)
This is only part of it of course Were
still tracking down the rest

FREMONT
(confidently)
Just a question of time

The words jerk Hank back into the conversation He glances
apprehensively from Renkins to Fremont

HANK
What do you mean

FREMONT
We had the money for two hours before the
kidnappers picked it up We couldn’t mark

FREMONT (contd)
it-we were afraid they’d detect the
markings and kill the girl--so we put
together a task force of twenty agents
and they wrote down as many of the serial
humbers as they could We ended up
recording just under five thousand of them
one out of ten of the bills

Hank stares at them too shocked to speak

RENKINS
Simply a matter of waiting for the numbers
to turn up You can’t go around passing
hundred dollar bills without eventually
sticking in someone’s memory

HANK

(stunned)

The money’s marked

FREMONT
That‘s what it amounts to Marked money

Renkins leans back in his chair smiles

RENKINS

She wipes at her tears steps forward holding out her hands

SARAH
Please Hank

She touches his face then leans in hugging him kissing him
He tries to pull away but she holds on intense and for an
instant it seems as if he might submit Then he jerks free
pushes past her to the fire She grabs at him and he turns
shoving knocking her back into the pile of money She falls to
the floor

Hank crouches opens the fire screen He throws the packets
onto the logs Behind him Sarah lies weeping on the carpet
Shes on her stomach scrambling at the pile of money dragging
packets toward her trying to hide them beneath her body

Hank stares into the fire WE SEE the packets catching their
edges curling their ink going black Very faintly WE begin to
HEAR the grinding of the feed mill which carries over into
