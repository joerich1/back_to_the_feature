INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOME - DAY
Black

Then a frozen image - MILES DAVIS (DC) 29 full youthful
glory on stage on a soundstage at the mic in front of the
first great sextet 1955 beautiful The image begins to
move fast forward whirs (stock) images blurring by to a
performance many years later -

CREDITS ROLL

MILES DAVIS 53 speaks in his cool rasp You have to lean
forward to hear He really knows how to make you listen

MILES (0S)
This one Right here

The tape slows plays at regular speed DAVE BRADEN 38
speaks

DAVE BRADEN (0S)
Ok Agartha

MILES (0S)
Osaka Japan - 75

Prelude 2 Agharta plays Funky Nasty Gutbucket bass
guitar

SUPER Prelude Fades up Fades out (NOTE All SUPERS in
the script are Miles Davis songs)

ON STAGE A trumpet player stands at the center the hub of a
quintet Tilt up to reveal MILES DAVIS 48 adorned like a
psychedelic pimp-god Hunched over horn bell pointed at the
floor soaked with sweat his back to the audience
iconically Miles searching for something buried in the
music

DAVE (0S)
Funky

MILES (0S)
Yep Cut the sound down

TECHNICIAN (0S)
Couple more minutes here guys

DAVE (0S)
No other side Nick

A GEAR BELLY wipes frame -
PULL BACK FAST 70s style focus and refocus revealing Miles
Davis looking a little older but clean as grandmoms
chittlins He sits in a chair while the interview is set-up
Miles holds a RED TRUMPET a small mic attached to the bell

IN THE ROOM - He noodles on the horn intermittently playing
with the music during the conversation (Throughout the
interview the camera plays a modal phrase its attention
between Miles here and the Miles there in Japan)

IN JAPAN - Miles straightens looks out into the crowd we
see FANS grooving to the rhythm reflected in HIS SHADES HIS
POV a dark void flashbulbs shadows a crowd of unseen
fans He starts to play again but stops - for the first time
in thirty years not knowing what to say We see the moment
from multiple angles and angels From high up Miles looks
small

Miles looks to the wings searching for someone among
those standing around and beyond a face he cannot find

REVERSE ANGLE - POV of Miles from an empty void in the wings
CAMERA moves a little Alive

TWO SHOT - Miles here and in Japan Japan Miles is sitting
over ‘79 Miles’ angel shoulder but no longer playing in his
ear

DAVE (0S) (CONTD)
So Miles I know it’s always “go
forward go forward” but even if
just for context we have to get
into (explore) your earlier stuff
and modal jazz’s influence -

MILES
I dont like that word jazz

DAVE (0S)
Nope I

MILES
(helping them to “get it”)
Thats a made up word Tryin to
box somebody in
(get it)
Dont call my music jazz

DAVE (0S)
Right You refer to it as the music
of the times

MILES
Social music
DAVE (0S)
Social music Perfect

On TV Miles mashes out an atonal chord with his right hand
and cranks the volume louder and louder silencing the band
As the din of the chord reverberates recedes he
contemplates the trumpet’s bell etched with a curvaceous
scroll his name in bold flickering blue in the stage light

DAVE (0S) (CONTD)

(going quickly through the

checkpoints)
So Be-bop boom Gil the Nonet
thing Then let’s dig in a little
bit Kind of Blue So What
modality of course binary
compositions and how that applies
to life your life women and art
the boxing -

MILES
(obvious )
Right Just not “jazz”

Miles noodles

DAVE
(to techy)
We getting close
TECHY (0S)
Almost
DAVE (0S)
Cool
(to Miles)

Ok so I start In seventy-five
one of the most prolific and
influential artists in all of
music shockingly stopped playing
Went silent leaving the world -

MILES
Look you’re gonna tell it don’t
say it all corny and shit

On the TV screen a surreal moment -- just the horn and Miles
surrounded by mute musicians Freeze frame

DAVE (0S)
Well what would you say Miles
Framed as it is it looks like ‘75 Miles is waiting to hear
the answer too Long beat as Miles thinks composing in his
head Miles puts his horn to his lips

BAM-BAM-BAM - GUNSHOTS tear into the aural landscape TAKING
US TO

INTEXT MILES DAVIS GREEN(4 SEATER) JAGUAR - NIGHT

SOUNDTRACK Aghartha pumps up to full 1970s Blaxploitation
shoot em up volume

The car ROARRRRRRING across a mostly deserted LOWER MANHATTAN
street in the midst of a GUNFIGHT BAM-BAM-BAM

MILES DAVIS passenger DAVE Braden white driver a black
eye fat lip dry blood on his jacket both dressed slick
stylish cool and ducking for cover -

A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR with blacked out windows TEARING
after them - we dont see whos in there just one GUN out
the driver’s window blasting the JaguarBAM-BAM

Miles Dave crazy ADLIBING Fuck shit motherfuckers

The Towncar is ultimately no match for the ROCKETING Jaguar -
Dave wrestles the wheel stick pedals on the job training
FISHTAILING the beast AROUND THE CORNER -

Dave loses control - the Jaguar SKIDS toward the wall -

A BULLET pierces the Jaguars body - one SLAMS into MILES
THIGH - (or ricochets off the sidewalk as Walter scrambles
out of his car and into Miles’ hip there)

Miles HOWLS as the Jaguar spins almost RAMS into the WALL of
a MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE before screeching to a stop it

stalls out Dave cant start it The Towncars GUNNING right
for them -

Miles and Dave scramble out of the car Miles clutches a
BRIEFCASE hobbling Dave helps him -

Miles FIRING at the oncoming Towncar - It swerves grinding
to a halt by the Jaguar WALTER a serious looking black dude
jumps out of the car -

Miles and Dave scramble INTO AN ALLEY Miles tripping
dropping the briefcase contents spilling out

A bunch of STAFF PAPER with musical notes scrawled on them
fly away in the wind - plus A REEL TO REEL TAPE in a can
rolls out (labeled 7-9-78)
Miles lurches for the tape and at the storm of papers
blowing around him - it all means everything to him

CUT TO

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOME- DAY

LOW CRAZY ANGLE Where are we All is SILENT save for a
guttural soft scratchy scatting The CAMERA MOVES along
the floor discovering a COCKROACH moving quickly darting
in and out of pockets of light and over clutter scattered
debris discarded food wrappers searching for something
clearly not found A wad of paper crashes to the floor near
the bug sending it scurrying off for cover We TILT UP a
pair of raggedy SLIPPERS dark ashen heels stuffed into
them up rusty CALVES the back of a worn out CHAIR and up
over the slumped shoulders of a man hunched there HEADPHONES
plastered on his ears a pair of wrinkled charcoal hands
jammed tightly over them A REEL TO REEL tape machine spools
out unheard music 7-9-78 written on the label

MILES
Duh - duh - da - dee - da - Da -
dee - da -

We PAN finding Miles framed like a never before seen iconic
photo of the cool his ebony skin challenging the darkness of
his surroundings - hes a stunning sight His chiseled
features softened by shadow his lithesome form draped in
pale silks In an instant his spidery fingers run tender
circles around the perimeters of his scatting lips like a
memory of lost but not forgotten love then to a nearby PAD
of STAFF PAPER Miles scrawls jotting hieroglyphics the
encrypted language of the papers just seen blowing in the
wind

MILES (CONT’D)
Da - dada - dee - dumdum - da -

A DISTANT ANGLE Dark Steamy sunlight begs at the hems of
drawn curtains A former church Little recollection of
religion in the ghostly curves of the place Now it feels
haunted Weeks months of clothes strewn about dirty dishes
empty Heineken and cognac bottles magazines newspapers and
grime carpet the floor spiders perched in spiderwebs

Drips of errant flickering light from a TV OFF-SCREEN play
with the corners of the frame On the silent screen GRAINY
STOCK FOOTAGE of boxer JACK JOHNSON July 4 1910 the Fight
of the Century against Great White Hope JAMES J JEFFRIES
before 20000 people in Reno In the 15th round Johnson
knocks Jeffries down and the nearly all white crowd jeers
spitting rage
We gather details of a lusciously frayed once elegant
tricked out pad of animal skins Lucite and leather

PHOTOS on the wall shelves on top of the piano of Miles
with everyone whos anyone playing everywhere on the planet
The world-beater A sign says No Visitors

MILES (CONT’D)
Da - datdat - dedaw - dat - dat

Miles sits riveted eyes squeezed shut 7-9-78 coming through
the headphones as he scrawls on the pad like a physicist
trying to work out The Theory of Everything Miles’ face
contorts as a sudden pain shoots through his hip He reaches
for it his arm in the headphone cable inadvertently pulling
it from the machine and letting in an almost painful
CACOPHONY OF SOUNDS

STREET NOISES car HORNS shouting other people’s shitty
music etc

A TEA KETTLE on the KITCHEN STOVE WHISTLING for all its
worth

The PHONE RINGING and RINGING

INCESSANT KNOCKING ON THE FRONT DOOR

ON THE RADIO Miles Davis So What from Kind of Blue
Miles sits in the midst of it all for a beat

MILES (CONT’D)
--fuck

Miles takes the headphones off his concentration blown He
stuffs them into the table DRAWER the reel to reel machine
sits on The drawer sticks and Miles battles with the broken
thing frustration ultimately winning and leaves it half
shut This writing session is over

Miles eyes adjust to the light peek up like flickering
embers - stare at his TRUMPET on its stand shimmering brass
beneath the dust like a glimmer of life staring at him
challenging him to pick it up and play

MILES (CONTD)
Fuck you looking at

As to a wife in a marriage that has climbed downward from
love to war to neglect In an instant and unresolved
Miles painfully stands and we almost hear the creeks of rough
living He squints hard as he turns to go into the kitchen
pivoting on his ruined hip When Miles opens his eyes he sees-

FRANCES TAYLOR early 30s staring at him perfection in milk
chocolate uncorrupted by the decay around her with an aura
of where you want to be She glides by locking him in her
gaze an enigmatic look on her face

Miles straightens up locks into her eyes He starts to speak
but Frances almost imperceptibly shakes her head “no” and
walks on HER LEGS forever and ever as she turns and goes
up the staircase especially designed for this singular
perfect view and disappears into the BEDROOM Gone from his
sight

Miles nods picks up a half empty Heineken off the table and
tugs it back on the move navigating through shadows thrown

by the cracks of light Lays the empty beer bottle down on a
table with others

Passing ignoring the RINGING PHONE
Passing ignoring his own sounds on the RADIO
Passing ignoring the KNOCKING ON THE DOOR

Passing the TV - throwing a stiff right hook into the air in
unison with Jack Johnson who knocks Jeffries down for a
second time

INTO THE KITCHENstove on pours green tea into a cup -
sips soothes his throat lights a cigarette After a long
drag Miles focuses in on the blue flame of the stove burner
He’s captivated by the significance of the vision if only
for himself

The FRONT DOOR KNOCKING STOPS and the cessation of this sound
snaps Miles out of it He crosses back to the living room

TAPPING ON THE WINDOW now Miles ignores it through a CRACK
IN THE CURTAIN we see the face of a pissed off Dave
Braden

Finally Miles has had it and Miles picks up the RINGING
PHONE

MILES (CONTD)
(into the phone)
What
KINGSTON MACK (VO)
(thick Kingston accent)
Ah you dere huh bumbaclot You

MILES

MILES

The culmination The mountaintop

Miles looks at the stereo SPEAKER doesnt like what Schaaps
saying

Miles pulls some reading glasses out of a little drawer
filled with the things and grabs a YELLOW PAGES off the
floor He lights a cigarette rips through the book until he
finds a number THE PHONE RINGS Miles picks it up -

Miles hangs up the phone Sips more tea fleetingly butts out
his cigarette in an overflowing ashtray lights another one -

Dave Braden reappears starts KNOCKING ON THE WINDOW again

Miles ignores him goes to an EASEL with an in-process wet
OIL PAINTING of a lush mostly red and black Picasso-esque
woman in the stands of a bullfight a dark-skinned matador

He stops steps back picks up the paint brush dips it in
color adds a couple strokes to the work studies it for a
few moments

SCHAAP (VO)
This one’s for you Mr Davis
Concierto De Aranjuez (Adagio)
from Sketches of Spain

As Concierto De Aranjuez (Adagio) the romantic epic music
of battlecomes on the radio

A muffled conversation in front of his door pulls Miles
attention then - PHUMP -todays mail comes through the slot
landing on a pile of weeks of unopened mail Miles walks over
to the mail and with his bare foot sifts through todays
arrivals

Dave starts knocking again creaks open the mail slot
DAVE
Mr Davis If you could just open

the door for a moment

Miles doesnt find what hes looking for A storm cloud forms
around him

Miles walks over to the phone dials On the other end

Miles slams the phone down Dave starts knocking again as
SKETCHES OF SPAIN swells Miles crosses tears open the door
with the chain on his jaw seriously working his chewing gum -

Dave Braden stands there dressed differently than in the
opening shoot out No style tweed corduroy loosened tie
drops of red on his shirt fresh scrape on his cheek
reddening around his eye Daves wearing some kind of story
that hes in the middle of

DAVE

Miles shuts the door - Dave sticks his foot in preventing
the door from closing Miles look - are you crazy

DAVE (CONTD)

comeback story

Wrong word Miles expression changes He nods

MILES
Okay

The door closes Dave straightens up tucks in slicks back
his hair trying to appear half-way presentable

Miles flings the door open and - POW - clocks Dave in the
face Dave stumbles back -

DAVE
What the -

grabs hold of Miles shoving both of them into a crazy dosey-
doe and suddenly

Miles is OUTSIDE barefoot while Dave is INSIDE Dave slams
the door in Miles face

INTERCUT MILES OUTSIDE DAVE INSIDE - Miles pounds on the
door

MILES
Open the door

DAVE
Take it easy

MILES
Open it

Dave backs away from the door takes the opportunity to walk
up the three steps push open the saloon doors and peer into
the room

ANGLE PANS TO tape on the reel to reel painting boxing on
the TV the ruinous decadent decay evidence of empty cocaine
bindles and residue not what he was expecting Dave pulls
out a small pocket camera (Agfa Optima 535) flash flash
flash Stows that then produces a TAPE RECORDER pushes

DAVE

Inside the master’s disheveled
lair the rumors now reality

Dave stows his works comes back to the door

DAVE
Alright No more punching man

Dave opens the door and Miles charges in his hip aching
coming at Dave -

MILES

deeper into room

DAVE

INT MILES’ JAGUAREXT MILES’ MANHATTAN HOME- A MINUTE LATER

Dave is in the driver’s seat checking out the freshest
reddening “mouse” under his eye in the rearview mirror -

DAVE
Prick

The front door of the house opens - Miles peeks out gingerly
into the sun then exits now wearing a dope brocade robe
silk scarf and sunglasses looking around paranoid -

MILES
Open the damn door

- as he hobbles down the stairs to the car - Dave reaches
across the console and pops open the passenger door for
Miles who gets in Clocks Dave’s running tape recorder on
the dashboard

MILES (CONTD)
What the fuck is that

DAVE
You mind

MILES
Take that thing off my goddamned
dash or I’m gonna slap you in the
mouth with it

Dave starts to comeback on Miles but bites his tongue coming
out like something between a cough and a laugh He pockets
the thing but not before he depresses RECORD And Miles is
already scouring the cars interior for cocaine - glove
compartment map pocket finding nothing but empty BINDLES
which he crumbles up and tosses Dave clocks the behavior
Miles looks at him -

MILES (CONT’D)
Let’s go

Dave works the ignition but it’s not turning over

MILES (CONTD)
Pump it

DAVE
Yeah I know how to

The car grumbles to life - ENGINE ROARS - the 54 64 break
kinetic freedom of Splash on the SOUNDTRACK and they pull
away from the curb just as an MG with 2 people inside JANICE

INT NYC THEATREGRAND THEATRE - DAY

Miles steps into the shadows of the wings smoking a
cigarette digging the PORGY AND BESS rehearsal for him its
all about the lead dancer Frances

Standing by Miles is his close friend and arranger GIL
EVANS 40s - white rail thin a natty argyle style
contrasting Miles finely tailored Italian suit

Frances is playing Bess - lusty steamy in her moves She
inspires Miles she seems to be looking right at him dancing
just for him - its all over his face hes falling in love

His inspired eyes drift to the TRIO he ZOOMS IN ON the piano
keys the ways the musician moves collecting co-opting -
and then back to FRANCES the key to it all -- dancing a sexy
pas-de-deux with the chiseled handsome LEAD DANCER Miles
clouds over

Fran stops the music with a wave of her hand

FRANCES
Hang on Let’s do that last section
again From the diminuendo

CHOREOGRAPHER
Sure

Frances cues the pianist they begin again

Miles clocks a couple white men (producersfinanciers)
looking in Miles’ mind at Frances like he does - with
desire hes suddenly jealous knowing the men can see up her
skirt as it flies and flutters around her

Miles looks threatened angry his gut turning surprised by
his reactions all new for him this obsessive desire to
possess a woman

Frances spies Miles in the wings and locks in relishing her
power over him She purposefully pushes away from her partner
and pirouettes in Miles’ direction using him as her spot
Almost there she trips Miles grabs for Frances but
BEFORE he catches her -

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOMEDILAPIDATED CHURCH - DAY

Miles and Frances enter frame arm in arm in the cavernous
main room of the dilapidated church Dusty pews and scary
judgemental angels sun shines through the stained glass
windows Flamenco Sketches plays

Frances scans the room then slowly strides away from Miles
down the center aisle hands lightly touching the pews As
she passes pirouetting the ROOM CHANGES darkness becoming
light (This effect will be achieved with a series of PHOTOS
from a locked off camera position as the room is dressed
ala City of God)

The final PHOTO Frances reaches the end of the room and
turns back to face Miles The scene comes to life the space
transformed an elegant stairway as its centerpiece leading
straight up to heaven

They both bound up the stairs into the bedroom

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOMEBEDROOM - LATER

Miles and Frances make love Deep passionate

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOMEBEDROOM - LATER

Frances and Miles lay on the bed having a lively
conversation laughing sipping champagne Frances is
beautiful and Miles drinks her in

FRANCES
so its the same

MILES
(sly smile)
Oh its the same huh

FRANCES
Yes

She floats her hand in the air Miles reaches his up to meet
it She holds her hand in a half finished flourish -

FRANCES (CONTD)
You know what I mean When its
right thereand you hold itand
you dont breathe and they dont
breathe and youre holding
themand then -

MILES
Whoosh

In a moment of inspiration Fran hops up wearing only Miles
shirt and begins to dance

FRANCES
We fly

-Miles visage slowly changes from rapt by her to rapt by
something else

As Miles watches HER VOICE FADES out - we see hes in love
with her not only entirely but its every piece of Frances
that he adores hands her legs hair eyes etc Miles
focuses on each part breaking her down Picasso-
esquedeconstructing Chopin --

WE NOW HEAR disparate notes a chord then another in the
progression half a tone up birthing a composition based on
the nine note scale that bookends the composition Gone -
the sound-track to Frances’ dance Fran spins laughs PUSH
IN Miles eyes narrow as he focuses on whats forming in his
mind

Fran spins closes her eyes given over to the rapture she
feels When she opens them Miles is gone Fran smiles to
herself slightly high knowing where he’s headed and that
she’s the elixir he drinks to create She heads out the door
seeing Miles at the bottom of the stairs - calls -

FRANCES (CONTD)
Sweetheart

Her voice faint the chords on the SOUNDTRACK in control now
Miles keeps moving

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOMERECORDING STUDIO - MOMENTS
LATER

Miles does a warm-up run on his horn as Frances enters She
calls to him but her voice is all but a whisper now Miles
cocks his head listening more closely to the chord bringing
it forward in is mind as well as in the TRACK He plays to
it

Fran watches prideful Miles finishes a phrase half turns
and catches sight of her She puts on a little fake pout
“You left me alone” Miles playfully pouts back goes to her

MILES
Aww baby girl

Miles kisses Frances softly deeply She kisses Miles back
walks backwards with him toward the couch pulls him down He
drops down sitting next to her and after a moment draws away
looking in her eyes Miles tasting her on his lips rubs his
finger around his embouchure closes his eyes languidly
blows Frans softness into the horn

Then Miles attention is drawn to the sound of is that
Funkadelic

EXT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOMESTREET - SAME

Miles and Dave pull up to the curb Miles takes the stash of
coke and his gun out of the secret compartment seems somehow
effected by the Frances moment we’ve just witnessed Miles

tape removes it from the machine Dave notes it moves in
behind him staying close to his prey As Miles puts his tape
away Dieter rambles on

DIETER

Dieter holds out his hand for a shake Miles doesn’t even
notice

Miles gets the tape in its can stuffs it into a drawer as a
few gawkers pass here and there clocking Miles “Shit that’s

Miles struggles with the sticking drawer

DAVE

The BARTENDER leans over the bar
BARTENDER
(butting in)
Hey Miles I heard you put it down
on that new session y’all did

Miles flashes him a quick look

BARTENDER (CONT’D)
My cousin play with your man Larry
Coryell sometime

The guy gives Miles a knowing insiders wink Miles half
acknowledges it drawn by the sounds of a quintet warming up
fucking around running phrases chord changes on the Miles
composition All Blues (bootleg version) - the trumpet
player is where Miles ear goes - clear bright sounds
something The bandstand just out of sight

Comes round the bend and sees Junior on the bandstand - Miles
is stopped in his tracks the quintet is great but hes
truly captivated by the virtuosity of Junior Dave is blown
away by the kid goes to comment to Miles stops seeing him
differently now ‘Miles appreciating greatness’ something
new

The band is having a good time laughing as one or another
calls out rapid chord changes - trying to one up each other
as the players have to catch onup to the changes - but not
Junior - hes right there a monster not only keeps up but
anchors the band bringing the music back around on the soar
like Kelly Slater killing it on the wave of a Tsunami -

PIANO PLAYER
G flat -

SAX PLAYER
I can do that -

JUNIOR
Uh huh -

BASS PLAYER
C minor -

The drummer switches from 44 to 34 time

BAND
Whoa

JUNIOR
D - double flat --

PIANO PLAYER
Damn

BASS PLAYER
Ahhhh - yeah -

DRUMMER
Wait what key is this in -

Watch those speed skaters whip around the musical bend low
and lightening fast - All Blues has been de-constructed
reconstructed and turned inside out - these guys are flying -

JUNIOR
B flat -

Junior blows a bright clear solo then takes over the song
suddenly blasting the punch-line to the joke - quotes the

musical phrase Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better too
loudly non-musically and they all lose it cracking up -

ECU - Miles hand fingers they start to twitch almost
imperceptibly but its there Ghost fingering keys We hear
the - whoosh whoosh whoosh of Miles pulse as it slows His
hand flinches clinches shut as if zapped by electricity

INT VILLAGE VANGUARD - LATERNIGHT
ON STAGE Miles with his quintet - Blue in Green Miles blows through his solo meditative focused The song
sounds like an apology for an argument gone unheard We let
this great music play

Others are present but Frances is about the only thing we
clearly see - shimmering illuminated sipping a martini
silently accepting his musical mea culpa The rest of the set
falls off into near darkness a cigarette tip here the glint
of a glass there smoke throughout the room

Miles finishes his solo and Bill Evans comes in to tie a bow
on it Miles takes off the mute puts his trumpet on the
stand strolls off stage lights a cig

The audience cheers and he and Frances lock eyes for the
briefest of beats when a blonde beauty looks rich ERICA
34 steps into his line of vision blocking Frances

ERICA
Hi Miles

MILES
Erica yeah

ERICA
Would you walk me out and help me
get a cab I dont feel its safe
for a girl out there by herself

Miles looks over at the stage

MILES
Y’all play that bossa

Miles glances back to Frances half shrugs Frances’ face is
a cipher giving up nothing She casually takes a cigarette
out of a pack and gracefully holds it suspended in air for
the all too willing nearby gentleman to light

MILES (CONT’D)
C’mon

Frances takes a drag sips her drink

EXT VILLAGE VANGUARD - CONTINUOUS
Miles walks Erica across the street to catch a cab

ERICA
Oh my God When you play like
thatits as if I can hear the
words even though no ones singing
you know what I mean Its like a
transfusion of life I feel all
throughout my body

She swoons nuzzling close whispering the adorations in his
ear He doesnt reciprocate but he doesnt fight her off
either Shes welcome to touch but she cant own

Miles holds up his arm to hail a cab

Frances is at the door of the club fresh drink in hand
looking at Erica hanging off Miles

A BEAT COP 45 white across the street watches Miles and
Erica - something doesnt feel right to the cop Something he
just doesnt like

Frances turns back inside the club

A cab stops Erica puts her hand in Miles hand ever the
lady and he ever the gentleman as he helps her into the
cab she reaches into her purse and goes to hand Miles a 50
bill (the way it used to be) - shes sweet a couple years
back hed take it - he holds up his hand -

MILES
Naw baby Im good I got it

Miles takes a 20 out and hands it to the cabbie She looks
at Miles with a call-me-anytime look -

ERICA
Maybe you want to come by later

MILES
Good night Erica

Miles taps on the cab and it drives her away He lights a
smoke

The cop crosses the street Miles watches him approach What
does this motherfucker want

A white MAN in a suit down the block takes notice -

COP
No loitering Move on

MILES
I work in there man

COP
I dont care where you work Move

MILES
Im taking a smoke break Im Miles
Davis Thats me on the marquis

COP
I dont a give a shit Move your
ass off this corner now or Ill

MILES
Im on public property man I can
stand here and have a smoke

The cop takes hold of Miles Miles pulls away Then leans
into the cop like a boxer fists instinctively rising when
he thinks the cops about to hit him The cop stumbles back
while going for his cuffs and nightstick

And at that moment Miles is cracked on the back of the head
with a nightstick courtesy of the white man in the suit - who
turns out to be a PLAINCLOTHES COP

Miles stumbles - dazed weaves but doesnt go down bleeding
from the head runs down his face - Detective Plainclothes
cracks him a second time then he goes down

The cops rough him up while hes down on the sidewalk CLOSE
ON Miles as he absorbs the punishment

Mr Plainclothes cuffs Miles and yanks him up as a small
crowd (20 people) starts to form

He flashes his badge voices yelling Stop it stop it
Thats Miles Davis Fucking cops Etc

Frances and a few others rush out of the club All
happening so fast

INT COUNTY JAIL - A BIT LATERNIGHT

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOMEBATHROOM - LATERNIGHT

adorn the room flickering light (sounds of Chopin fill the
house) wine the mood set The door opens and Frances comes
in wearing a robe She drops it to the floor Whoa Frances
slides into the tub behind Miles She wets the soap and
starts washing him gently lovingly his wounds the dried

then bolts runnning through a SIDE DOOR

connecting with Daves jaw- Dave stumbles backward - drops
the gun - it goes skittering off Junior hits him again -
Dave smashes into stuff recovers lands two solid punches on
Junior stunning the kid pleasing himself Junior returns
with a combo that lays Dave out

Junior picks up the gun stands over Dave (like Miles stood
over Dave with a gun at their initial meeting at the house) -
when Miles comes up behind Junior and puts cold steel to the
back of Juniors head - his mouthpiece Junior stops cold

JUNIOR
Okay okay be cool

- Miles reaches around and takes his gun back from Junior
Junior turns to see Miles - and that he just got played with
that mouthpiece Damn Miles pushes him in his back and he
goes tumbling into some boxes in the corner out of breath
Miles closes in Dave flanks

DAVE

INT JUNIOR’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The place is a little ransacked Hear CHERYL (2 year-old
girl) crying in the bedroom Junior quickly heads into the
bedroom leaving Miles and Dave

Miles’ head cocks almost imperceptibly an inexplicable sense
of familiarity these threadbare surroundings the cacophony
of smells and sounds the chili spaghetti on the stove -
coagulated somebody didn’t make it home for supper one
empty bowl of the stuff on the table and a dirty highchair
drawn with browning flung bits of it

And a cockroach scurrying across the light into darkness

The crying kid the conversation between Junior and Irene
becoming a movement inside an unfolding composition -

ON MILES and on his POV of Junior in the doorway of his
bedroom - talking to his wife IRENE 24 All we see are her
legs sitting in a chair comforting Cheryl in her lap

JUNIOR
What happened

Irene doesn’t answer -

CARTER on double bass TONY WILLIAMS on drums and Wayne
Shorter on tenor saxophone

Miles picks up his trumpet and they play Nefertiti a
little quick They soar As Miles solos in the deepest
thrall of it the reflection of a RED LIGHT starts FLASHING
on his face - we dont get it but Miles does - its the
phone silently ringing - but that’s not what breaks his
concentration - he cuts it off band stops -

MILES
It’s too fast

Miles starts counting it off about to play when (a couple
seconds after the blinking red light went off) the angry
voice of Frances upstairs breaks through

it barely leaves his hand (with Dave all over him) bouncing

off the dumpster and back at Miles

Walter never utters a sound in the scramble calm doing his

job as if Miles can’t be heard or seen barely a flea

SIRENS heard in the distance approaching Miles can now

only watch as

hurrying back to see the fight A BLACK AND WHITE MAN in the

carrying a stand-up ashtray two security guards on his ass
He smashes his elbow into a FIRE ALARM box setting it off -

Miles goes to his work area Junior follows at a respectful
distance as Miles threads the tape and hits play Tape spools
through the heads

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOME - KITCHEN - SAME

Dave goes through the sink cabinet looking for supplies then
stops hearing the indecipherable sounds emanating from the
other room

INT MILES DAVIS MANHATTAN HOME - SAME

Dave returns with the stuff finding Miles sitting at his
station full concentration Junior behind him Dave sidles
in next to Junior They listen waiting to hear something
resembling music But its just disorganized noise so far
conversations about music stops and starts flirtations with
concepts but nothing concrete

Dave looks at Junior - Am I missing something Juniors
look - Give it a minute

Miles fast forwards the tape but even at its sped up tempo
we can tell hes not running over music He hits stop Play
Listens Its more of the same

DAVE
When do you come in

MILES
Im already in there

DAVE
I dont hear any-

MILES
I played organ

Jesus Christ Dave squints at Junior - This is it Junior
looks at his shoes crushed witnessing his hero falter He
sighs

Hearing the sound Miles snaps his head around sees Daves
shock but worse Juniors look of pity Pity Miles Achilles
heel

Miles stands up goes to his trumpet case pops it open Dave
perks up Miles Davis first notes after five years An
incredible moment about to unfold But Junior is unchanged a
horn player knows

Miles returns to his station spreads out his musical scrawl
He pulls out his mouthpiece pops it on holds open the spit
valve and blows through the dormant instrument No spit no
mist just dank air Miles licks his lips the mouthpiece
takes a deep breath and blows

Nothing The labored ragged sound of an atrophied embouchure
after a five year lay off He tries to play it off lets out
a dark chuckle

MILES (CONTD)
Damn

Miles licks his lips and blows again gets the same result
Not funny Junior looks like he might cry Miles get pissed
now tries to overpower the instrument blows hard manages
to coax out a squeak Then silence except for the musical
mish mash playing in the background

JUNIOR
Aw that aint nothing man Hit
them scales right Your chops come
back Real quick

Junior chuckles

DAVE
Yeah Its just like some
practice right

Their help neither solicited nor appreciated has the
opposite effect Miles looks at his horn nods gravely and
lays it down Theres a long uncomfortable silence as Miles
starts to walk away Junior gently puts his hand on his
shoulder

JUNIOR
Youll get it back man

Miles digs in his pocket and pulls out the last balloon of
heroin he took from Junior earlier Hands it to him

MILES
Bye bye

Miles flops down onto the couch Done Dave starts chuckling
darkly -

Junior stares at the baggie in his hand contemplating He
sits down in front of the spinning reel and the gibberish
poring out of the speakers

Miles looks over finds a half drunk bottle of booze wipes
the top of it with his sleeve and then takes it to the head
Finshing it off he let’s out a deep sigh Dave can’t believe
what he’s looking at

DAVE
This is not are you kidding me

Miles clicks on the TV Focuses on the fight playing there
Dave nods laughs a long hollow “How’d I not see this
coming” laugh

DAVE (CONTD)
(quietly to himself)
What was I thinking

DAVE (CONTD)
(to Miles)
Going back in your hole huh Guess
I should’ve expected that It’s a
good thing I came prepared You
mind

Dave pulls out his camera Snaps a shot Miles squints
finally looks back at him

DAVE (CONTD)
I gotta hunker down too Got work
to do See Im coming out with the
fuckin story you better believe
that Forget about the comeback
piece It’s dirt time And I’m
coming with it

Dave gestures sprinkling dirt on his grave Miles swigs as
Dave rolls on

DAVE (CONTD)
Rolling Stone passes so what Have
any idea how many peoplell want to
buy what I got You may be a
fucking quitter but youre still
an earner baby

He pops off a shot and Miles chucks the bottle at his head
Dave ducks it quick guffaws He pops another picture

DAVE (CONTD)
Thats it But remember you’re
Miles Davis Don’t be repetitive
Switch it up a little bit I mean
you already did the self-pitying
junkie jazz burnout asshole
thing right

Realizing it’s all falling on deaf ears -

DAVE (CONTD)
FUCK

Dave plops down into a chair sick to his stomach
Then a loud trumpet run cuts through Dave’s rant

Junior Miles trumpet in his hand looking at the scrawl
deciphering it Inspired Junior cuts off the reel to reel
and rips another musical phrase having mined some gold
Miles and Dave watch and listen in silence as Junior grabs
the treasure map ledger pages -

JUNIOR
Ima go over to the piano

Junior strides over to the piano reads plays a few
chords

MILES
What is that

JUNIOR
(squinting at the scrawl)
Thats what you have here

MILES

JUNIOR
(grinning at the scrawl)
Yes it is its the 5 sus chord

Zooming to the two Miles walks over Junior plays a chord
with his right hand

MILES
Ok -

JUNIOR
- to the 3rd f major to the
tonic minor to the flat 6 B
major

Miles puts the mute in the trumpet bell and they figure it
out together for a few bars Junior humming Miles to the
right notes also with head movement

MILES
Why dont you change that 2nd chord

Miles peeks at Dave a sec “guess so”

POV from the staircase someone or something watches the trio
working out Frances We hold on the tableau from this
vantage point for a beat

Junior nods plays another chord Miles blows too ragged
edges ever so slowly smoothing out

Dave walks up to the piano grabs a pencil from the stand
takes a sheet from the pile of staff paper flips it over
starts feverishly writing the story Stay here until too long

stand picks up the valise stuffed with staff paper the
record SMPWC tucked in behind the tape cannister and walks
off camera

MILES
(over his shoulder)
Keep rolling

Dave enters frame turns to the camera shrugs “Is he
fucking serious” Dave calls out to Miles

DAVE
Hey are you coming back

INT NYC CLUB - FEBRUARY 22 20-- NIGHT

The stage The band comes on - Gary Clark Jr Esperanza
Spaulding Wayne Shorter Herbie Hancock

Miles jumps it all off stepping up to the mic and firing a
run looking good now strong back The band locks in and
they begin to run the voodoo down no one leading everyone
following searching for all that is said and unsaid the
particles that make up the fabric of life itself

CREDITS ROLL

Miles finishes his solo and steps to the side to watch PUSH

IN on Miles you can see it up close the corners turn up
slightly -- Miles Smiles
