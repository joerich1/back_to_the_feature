EXT CROSS LAKE - NIGHT 1

Moonlit water Dinghy creaking against a rotting dock
Farmhouse just up from the shore

MAURICE (50s) bangs on the farmhouse door CLAYTON (80’s)
answers

CLAYTON
What is it

MAURICE
Found Clara

Clayton steps out onto his sagging porch

MAURICE (cont’d)
Might wanna grab your hip waders

Old man gives a puzzled look

CUT TO

EXT CROSS LAKE - MOMENTS LATER 2

Clouds of bugs Drifting mist FLASHLIGHT BEAM bouncing off
glass-smooth water

Clayton now in hip waders and battered gray fishing hat
slogs with Maurice through waist-deep water Maurice leads
panning his flashlight Clayton follows carrying a gaff on a
long wooden pole

CLAYTON
Don’t see nothin’

MAURICE
She’s out here Somewheres

CLAYTON
(cups an ear)
What

MAURICE
I said she’s out here Least she
was an hour or so ago

Maurice swings his light around Glimpses a DARK SHAPE in
the fog

MAURICE (cont’d)
Tha’d be her
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 2

They wade out deeper Progress slows

CLAYTON
The hell she doin’ way out here

As they draw nearer the form is clearly that of a DEAD COW

MAURICE
Musta fell in Or got stuck in the
mud Once they bloat up like that
they float pretty good

UNDERWATER Flashlights rake the murky water Seen from
below the dead heifer is perfectly intact legs dangling no
sign of external trauma

In the surrounding water-- nothing stirs

Beam sweeps across a CLUSTER OF FISH EGGS glowing
translucent Curled larval shapes inside

Light shines on the cow’s head Glint of TWO BLACK EYES
Dead staring A SINGLE FISH EGG slowly rolls down the
extended tongue

ABOVE WATER Maurice and Clayton wade up to the cow Almost
to their necks now Clayton extends the gaff pole Hooks
the carcass and starts to drag it toward him

CLAYTON
Make y’self useful

Maurice lends a hand

UNDERWATER The two men’s FEET scuff backwards across the
lake bed kicking up silt clouds

But nothing else stirs

ABOVE WATER Maurice and Clayton pull the huge carcass
toward shore like they’re towing a barge

MAURICE
She’s a big’un alright

CLAYTON
Took second place last year at
county Now this Damn it to hell

The half-submerged cow suddenly JOSTLES
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 3

MAURICE
You see that
(it jostles again)
Think it’s a gator

CLAYTON
A what

MAURICE
(on edge)
A gator down there tuggin’ on the
carcass

The old man bends forward shining his light into the murk
Nose brushing the water’s surface

MAURICE (cont’d)
Aw Clay you don’t wanna do that

UNDERWATER Clay’s DISTORTED FACE as seen from below His
nose like a big ripe plum

ABOVE WATER He finally straightens

CLAYTON
Nothin’ down there but feet

He grabs hold of the pole again and resumes towing the dead
cow Walking backward thru chest deep water

MAURICE
Had me concerned there for a minute

CLAYTON
Yall shoulda been there in ‘45
when the ‘napolis went down Eight
hunnert of us thrashin’ and
flailin’ in water with more sharks
than there was sailors Now that
was cause for--

Clayton suddenly JERKS DOWNWARD

MAURICE
Clay--

CLAYTON
(sputtering for air)
Hep Hep me
Maurice grabs hold of the old man and pulls

Something isn’t letting go
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 4

UNDERWATER Clay’s foot is stuck in a jagged FISSURE the
width of a fist scissoring out across the lake bed

After a few violent jerks the foot POPS FREE
ABOVE WATER The old man pops back up like a bobber

CLAYTON (contd)
Whew Praise the Lord

MAURICE
What happened

CLAYTON
Stepped in a damn rut

MAURICE
I wade in this lake a million
times never stepped in no rut
before

They get back to business as-- SOMETHING RIPPLES across the
cow’s bloated belly From the inside

CLAYTON
(pulling the cow closer)
Shine the light there-- right there
on the belly

There it is again Like something’s pushing to get out

MAURICE
She’s calving God damn

CLAYTON
She ain’t alive and she sure as
hell ain’t pregnant

MAURICE
Then what

Clay reaches out a hand Presses on the belly

CLAYTON
Damned if I know

The cow FARTS OMINOUSLY bubbles pluming from the back end
SEVERAL MORE FISH EGGS pop out the ass

CLAYTON (contd)
(recoils)
Holy flyin’ baby shit

Maurice cocks an ear
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 5

MAURICE
Hear that

CLAYTON
Hear what

MAURICE
Deaf old bastard that

A TEARING GNASHING SOUND Like a hundred gnawing rodents

The cow slowly lists to one side A LARGE SEAM RIPS OPEN
ALONG THE BELLY as--

FISH SPILL OUT Dozens of tiny flapping PIRANHAS all teeth
and spiked fins They pour into the water and scatter just
darting little flickers in the moonlight

MAURICE (cont’d)
The hell are they Fish
(jolts)
Aghh-- One a them little suckers
just up an’ bit me Sonofa-BITCH

CLAYTON
(swatting the water)
Me too They all over me

MAURICE
Let’s get outta here Now

They turn to flee Maurice is out front arms paddling for
the shallows

MAURICE (cont’d)
Hurry up old man

CLAYTON
I’m hurryin’

It’s slow going Especially for the 80-something Clayton
Like running slow-motion in a nightmare

Maurice turns back to give his elderly neighbor a hand In
an instant the water is frothing red around his waist

MAURICE
Sweet Jesus

He flails stumbles goes down A second later he breaks
the surface gasping hysterical

MAURICE (cont’d)
Hellllp Hellllllp--
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 6
CLAYTON
Hep yourself asshole
The old man plows right past him and hauls ass for shore
Maurice goes down again

Clayton flails ahead panting Feels bites all up and down
his body

CLAYTON (contd)
(gasping)
Get off me Get off

He tries to keep moving but he’s totally winded now barely
making any progress

The water CHURNS around him Glints of fins and teeth and
milky white eyes There must be HUNDREDS down there

Clayton thrashes downward until the water engulfs him

He BREACHES with A DOZEN SMALL PIRANHAS CLAMPED ONTO HIS FACE
AND NECK He rips one of those gnashing little buggers off
his cheek and glares at it eyeball to eyeball

In a last act of total bad-ass futility HE BITES OFF THE
HEAD and SPITS IT AT CAMERA

CUT TO

EXT CROSS LAKE - MOMENTS LATER 3
The night sky mirrored off the lake’s perfect stillness
Clayton’s crumpled gray fishing hat DRIFTS ACROSS THE FRAME
A moment of QUIET SERENITY before

CLAYTON’S SHREDDED SKULL-FACE SUDDENLY HEAVES UPWARD INTO A
MONSTROUS CLOSE-UP Water sheets off his face mixing with
the blood pouring from his empty eye sockets

PARTY MUSIC KICKS IN as we MATCH CUT TO--

A PAIR OF LARGE BREASTS splashing up out of a swimming pool
And yes the boobs are perfectly lined up with Clayton’s
empty eye sockets to create a SEAMLESS TRANSITION to

To those still wondering what this movie is about-- quit now
There’s no hope for you

EXT WILDERNESS WATERS - DAY 4
Sculpted sign over the entrance reads

WILDERNESS WATERS
“YOUR BEST BET IN WETTER-TAINMENT”

This water park has it all-- tubes slides wave pools faux
rivers and gaudy concessions

What it does not have -- yet -- are visitors A HUGE PLACARD
over the MAINTENANCE SHED warns

3 DAYS TILL OPENING

With so much yet to be done the PARK STAFF and MAINTENANCE
CREW -- about two dozen in all -- have responded with an all-
out PARTY RIOT

SEVERAL STAFFERS plunge fully clothed into the Wave Pool to
join the busty girl featured in the title card

Somebody jacks his iPod into the park PA SYSTEM and the
energy ramps to POUNDING AFRO-CUBAN Nearly everyone stops
what they’re doing to hit the water

The staffers all sport obligatory “WETTER IS BETTER” company
T-shirts The tight cotton shirts look really hot on the
chicks Not so much on the paunchy middle-aged grounds crew

The fun grinds to a temporary halt at the appearance of MADDY
striding up the main concourse with a duffel bag slung over
one shoulder Early 20’s and smartly sexy she stops everyone
in their tracks Not just because she’s a looker

She’s also the boss’s daughter

Surprised stares from the crew Especially BARRY the skinny
guy in the orange vest spearing litter with a garbage prong
He nearly spikes his own foot

MADDY
(smiles )
That’s right y’all the prodigal
bitch is back
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 8

INT PARK OFFICE - DAY 5

Maddy throws her bag down on the desk of CHET (50’s) the park
owner and Maddy’s father

The sound causes a pair of WALL-MOUNTED “JINGLE-JUGS” (think
Billy Bigmouth Bass-- but as a pair of large boobs) to start
JIGGLING on the wall behind Chet It plays the redneck
classic “TITTIES and BEER” by Rodney Carrington

MADDY
Nice touch You’ve really done
wonders with the place

CHET
(looks up smiling)
I’m glad you’re here

MADDY
Wish I could say the same

Smile evaporates Chet removes his glasses

CHET
I really am sorry to do this
Maddy But I can’t run this place
on my own And there’s nobody else
who knows it like you

MADDY
Without that summer internship at
Woods Hole I don’t get into grad
school Which is exactly what you
wanted so don’t look so glum

CHET
Don’t forget this park put you
through four years of college
already

MADDY
Four more years than I need to run
a water park

CHET
You owe this place You owe me

Maddy glares back but says nothing
CHET (cont’d)

(brittle smile)
Go ahead I’m all ears
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 9

MADDY

If I told you what I think right
now you’d put your fist through my
mouth So if you don’t mind

(slings bag over her

shoulder)
Ill just wait till I’m back on the
family dental plan

She turns and stalks out of the office Slams the door The
noise makes the rubber titties start jiggling and singing all
over again

VOICE FROM UNDER CHET’S DESK
That your daughter

CHET
Step daughter

VOICE FROM UNDER CHET’S DESK
Ah

EXT WILDERNESS WATERS - EVENING 6
ROCKETS streak across the night sky

The annual pre-opening STAFF PARTY is in full swing kicked
off as always by a ROMAN CANDLE WAR

DRUNK STAFFERS armed with roman candles and bottle rockets
run around shooting each other high on liquid courage

NAKED WATER-SLIDERS scream down the chutes on their stomachs
and backs others ride rubber pool animals and plastic chairs

BIG DAVE a hefty maintenance guy with a permanent leer
stands off to one side with his wiry co-worker XAVIER
sharing a joint Both stare at a TOPLESS SLIDER as she flies
out of the tube and hits the splash pool

BIG DAVE
Man I’m so horny right now I could
fuck a pinecone

Maddy sits alone on the edge of the wave pool feet dangling
in the water as flares whiz past her head

A THOROUGHLY-WASTED REVELER staggers by belting the national
anthem Just as he gets to “and the rockets red glare” he
takes a direct hit in the ass and runs off shrieking
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911

Barry sweet awkward and still harboring a mad high school

crush on Maddy walks up with two beers

MADDY

IQ higher than his age

a little lift to the gene pool

MADDY

sperm bank Mom always wanted a
banker in the family

MADDY
What about the hacking thing That
sounded promising

Hands one to Maddy

He glances over at TWO STONERS firing roman candles at each
other point blank
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911

BARRY

These days you gotta take down a
multinational and do three-to-five
years in lockup to get any serious
cred as a hacker That’s even longer

than a Master’s

MADDY

seconds Andy’s expression turns to alarm

The man his face in shadow sits with a Coke in one hand a
PROMOTIONAL FLYER for “WILDERNESS WATERS” in the other

The page folds out to a full panoramic of the water park
Several CELEBRITY FACES screen-grabbed off the internet are
included along with an invitation to “MEET THE CELEBRITY
LIFEGUARDS” Most prominent is a photo of DAVID HASSELHOFF
looking uber-hot from his Baywatch days

The man lifts his face to the light If you look beyond the
beard stubble and the squinting eyes you’ll recognize him as
DAVID HASSELHOFF circa now He raises his glass sucks the
ice dry and slams his empty down onto the end table using
the flyer as a handy coaster

From the HALLWAY the sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS and
MANIC CHATTER “The Hoff” glances out his open door just as
KIM KARDASHIAN tromps past followed by two excited desk
clerks and way too much luggage

Why the hell don’t you call

She sits with one foot tucked under her butt while the other
dangles over the side grazing the glassy surface and making
perfect little circular ripples in her reflection

CLOSE ON WATER WE SEE but she doesn’t A DORSAL FIN break

Shelby slips on earbuds brings up “ASHLEYS PLAYLIST” on her
phone Muffled TECHNO-BEAT filters out

CLOSE ON WATER Her toe absently taps the water More ripples
Again the FIN and part of a plated back Closer Then gone

SHELBY (contd)
(stifling a sob)
Ash I’m sorry I tore your head off
and threw it under the mower

Now she sees it Something LARGE moving just under the
surface A bit odd But no reason to think piranha

She tries to nudge it with her foot It splashes the surface
then circles back around

Shelby follows the fish with her big toe Unwittingly
frustrating its attempts to bite her

Now A SECOND FIN joins the first And a THIRD A1l
closing in on that single dangling foot

Shelby taps the water a few more times the fins getting
closer closer

She lifts her foot just as a GIANT PIRANHA LUNGES UP AND CHOMPS
EMPTY AIR It flops back down into the water with a big
splash This is one of the adults a solid forty-pounder

Shelby startled leans over the edge and looks down

SHELBY (cont’d)
Holy Christ

The water is beginning to CHURN MORE FINS APPEAR A FRENZY
in the making Several HUGE GNASHING JAWS break the surface

SHELBY (cont’d)
Ohmigod

She jerks her leg up and flails backward onto the dock She
lies there for a few seconds too frightened to stand

Sounds of CHURNING WATER and GRINDING TEETH below her What
the hell is going on down there

Gathering her wits Shelby scrambles to her feet as-- THUMP
Something hits one of the pilings She topples off balance

ANOTHER THUMP Even harder She lurches the other way
Drops down to a four-point crouch Eyes white with fear

Beneath her the SOUNDS OF TEETH GNAWING WOOD Chewing
through creosote and old growth pine like buzz saws
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 31
Shelby can’t see what’s happening but knows time is running
out She rises to a wobbly stand takes a nervous step as--

BANG A PLANK POUNDS INTO THE AIR It clatters down onto
the dock leaving a six inch gap inches from her feet

SHELBY SCREAMS Whatever hurled itself into that plank did
so with unimaginable force Driven by insatiable hunger

BANG ANOTHER PLANK FLIES INTO THE AIR AND ANOTHER

All the while that infernal gnawing is going on below The
fish are attacking the support pilings with purpose

Shelby Hyperventilating now Breath coming in frantic gasps

BANG BANG BANG Three more planks go flying WIDER AND
WIDER GAPS opening up along the length of the dock

A JUMBO PIRANHA LEAPS UP THROUGH THE CLOSEST GAP rips away a
MOUTHFUL OF SHIRT before crashing back into the water

Shelby staggers to her feet sporting a ragged half-tee

SHELBY (cont’d)
Oh God Oh God Oh God

She straddles the dock in a kind of splay-footed tap dance
not knowing where to set her feet next

BANG BANG More planks hammer into the air Methodically
dismantling the dock

Shelby’s only way forward is to hop between the remaining
planks One misstep and it’s over

She nearly overshoots on her first jump arms windmilling
crazily to stay upright Eyes fixed on that frothing water

topples backward Maddy grabs hold steadies her

Everything’s OK now
(the dock SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY)
No it isn’t Run

Too late-- THE WHOLE ROTTING DOCK DISINTEGRATES AROUND THEM
They both SPLASH DOWN into the infested water

Fortunately the water’s only knee-deep at this point so
they’re up and running in the next heartbeat

Maddy grabs Shelby’s hand and drags her toward shore with
everything she’s got

UNDERWATER POV We CHASE TWO PAIRS OF CYCLING LEGS from
below Closing the gap in seconds awash in a PLUME OF
BUBBLES It’s now a death-race between feet and fins

ABOVE WATER Maddy and Shelby pick up speed in the
shallowing water until they’re all-out SPRINTING

They reach the shoreline and DIVE FOR THE SAND Both roll
onto their backs chests heaving as--

A LARGE PIRANHA LEAPS CLEAR OUT OF THE WATER AND LANDS RIGHT
BETWEEN MADDY’S LEGS

Maddy SCREAMS and flings herself backward to escape the
wildly thrashing chomping predator

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 33

SHELBY
Kill it Kill it

Maddy rolls to one side palms a rock and HAMMERS IT The
piranha flops and gnashes at her with a shrieking sound like
a blown valve

Maddy slams the rock down again and again which only makes
this seemingly indestructible fish even madder

Finally Shelby reaches past Maddy and hoists a MUCH BIGGER
ROCK two-handed

SHELBY (cont’d)
AGGHHHH--

With a BANSHEE YELL she brings it SMASHING DOWN The piranha
lets out a clipped little squeak and goes still Blood oozes
out the gills as it makes little dying gasps for air

mind-blown to speak

just as much a threat to each other
as they are to their prey If one

it and rip it to shreds

BARRY
Just like high school

Maddy and Barry share a knowing look

MADDY
Speaking of which you also have
your alpha piranha He leads the
pack initiates the kills and gets
to do all the spawning The trick
would be to eliminate the alpha
before the next attack

alpha

He’s usually the one with the
biggest jaws

A CACOPHONY of barking cawing screeching and mewing

Goodman leads Maddy and Barry through a cluttered storage
room stacked floor-to-ceiling with AQUARIUMS of all sizes and
shapes Some filled with exotic fish others filled with
books and papers

MR GOODMAN
The appearance of the fish in Lake
Victoria coincided with the rupture
of a subterranean fault under the

lake

MADDY
But our river goes nowhere near
there

MR GOODMAN

The fact that they’ve appeared
beyond Lake Victoria’s watershed
suggests they’re moving through
underground waterways and not along
the surface They might come up
just to feed then slip back through
a crack or fissure and be gone
Like they were never even there

The threesome reaches the largest tank in the room

Inside a SINGLE GIANT PIRANHA swims back and forth like a
caged lion Eyes milky white but staring nonetheless

And teeth Dozens of jagged razor teeth

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
As you know piranha are like rats
with fins they’1l chew through
practically anything Pound for
pound they’re the most powerful
chewing mechanism on earth

He crosses over to a work bench and gathers up several
squares cut from different materials

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
I’ve already done a few rough
experiments on this fellow to gauge
bite strength and the results are
quite shocking If this is only a
juvenile an adult could be two
three times this size Or more

He slides the first partition into a pre-cut slot confining
the fish to just one third of the tank It snaps viciously
at the new wall but doesn’t try to get past it

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
This one is wood Solid hardwood
oak

He slides in a second partition

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
This is cement

Then a third

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
And this one is galvanized steel
Like ordinary household plumbing

He goes over to a wire cage Plucks out a LIVE MOUSE

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
Now for a bit of incentive

BARRY
Not the little mouse

MR GOODMAN
Sorry Sold out of puppies this
morning

He lifts a small circular hatch on the tank lid and drops the
mouse into the water on the opposite side of the three
partitions

The mouse paddles around in nervous circles as the piranha
catches a whiff of live prey

With a sudden flurry of gnashing teeth the piranha chews
through the wooden barrier in a few short bites
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 46

MADDY
No wonder that dock went down so
fast

MR GOODMAN
Now the cement

The piranha makes short work of the cement barrier as well

BARRY
Whoa It’s a mini-Terminator

As if sensing its imminent demise the mouse is now paddling
double-time

The piranha thrashes at the steel partition but can’t get any
purchase with its teeth

MR GOODMAN
Now this I think is quite
resourceful Watch

The piranha circles back to the far side of the tank then
RAMS the barrier with its head

The three bony spurs atop its head pound DENTS into the
smooth steel surface roughly the same triangular shape as
the piranha’s teeth

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
Now it’s got something to grab

With a solid bite-grip on the partition The predator rips
its way through the steel with its teeth

Once free of this last obstacle it rushes the doomed mouse

Barry suddenly flips the tank hatch jams his hand into the
water and SNATCHES THE MOUSE

Amazingly his hand comes out in one piece He unclenches
his fist to let the mouse scurry around in his open palm

Oh dear fuck

Well something could disrupt the
fissures through which they entered
our waters Like an explosion But
there’s an even more insidious
possibility

He taps the spacebar on his computer SUPPORTING GRAPHICS
pop onto the screen

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
If you consider the geology of their
subterranean habitat the water would
have large concentrations of sulfur
dioxide from all the geothermal activity
Which is how they’d find their way back
into those water systems

BARRY
Just follow the rotten egg smell

MR GOODMAN
Exactly Problem is sulfur dioxide
is commonly released in the treatment
of chlorinated water So it’s
entirely possible that the fish could
become confused and infiltrate city
sewer systems instead

MADDY
They could wind up in our plumbing
(off Goodman’s nod)
Have you told anybody about this

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 48

moment

BOOM BOOM BOOM THREE MORE EXPLOSIONS rip the lake in
rapid succession

steps behind with a large box of SWIMWEAR

Suspicious looks all around What did he mean by that

Stacey returns with Maddy in tow Chet shoves Maddy front

CHET (cont’d)

Maddy stands inside an aluminum Quonset hut with a clipboard

taking inventory of supplies and chemicals

DOZENS of FIVE-GALLON PLASTIC CONTAINERS line one wall

Labels read CHLORINE FOR POOL USE ONLY
Maddy looks up as Chet enters the shed

CHET
So-- you get everything straightened
out with the celebs

MADDY
Dad how come there’s only half the
chlorine supply we had yesterday

CHET
We always flush the system before
opening day with extra chlorine
You know that

MADDY
I know but--

CHET
Don’t forget between last
September and now we’ve had six
months of stagnant water It was a
bacterial soup out there

MADDY
OK but fifty times the normal
concentration of chlorine Isn’t
that a bit excessive

CHET
Xavier found three dead cats in the
Lazy River when he came in last
week to open up Read the new
health codes Maddy They’re a
bitch
(beat)
I hear Hasselhoff is a drinker

The place is all spruced up and ready for Opening Day

The crisp blue waters of the various pools sparkle in the
setting sun

Colored banners wave in the breeze

All that’s missing are the crowds

Barry stands in the middle of the spotless grounds absently
throwing his garbage prong at a nearby tree like a game of

giant darts

He fetches the spike and returns to his first position As
he winds back to throw again Maddy steps up behind him

MADDY

BARRY
Practicing for the Olympics

this bad feeling
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911

BARRY
You mean that stuff about the
chlorine by-products

MADDY
Yeah We’ve dumped a ton of it
(looks down at water)
-and it all winds up right here

She strips down to her t-shirt and panties

MADDY (cont’d)
The outflow pipes should be right
below us

BARRY
I’m sure you’ve considered how
insanely crazy this is

MADDY
Kyle and his boys cleared the lake

(slips into the water)
I hope

She swims out a few yards turns back

MADDY (cont’d)

back Just in case

BARRY

MADDY

A knowing look passes between them Maddy smiles

MADDY

She catches it one-handed
MADDY (cont’d)
It won’t take long I just need to
make sure the grates over the pipes

are still intact And then we can
all rest a bit easier

legs following as gracefully as a mermaid’s tail

Her face is pale with dark hollowed eyes A sheen of sweat
clings to her forehead

Not yet There’s still a lot of
debris from the explosions mucking up
the water down there Kyle really
did a number on the lake bottom

Be careful

MADDY
Right

She takes another deep breath and dives down again

BARRY
(imitating himself)
“Be careful”
(sighs)
I am so the chick in this
relationship

UNDERWATER It’s as black as deep space Only light comes
from Maddy’s submersible flashlight The water is so clouded
with weeds and trash something could be only a couple feet
away yet remain unseen

Maddy pinches her nostrils to equalize the pressure and dives
EVEN DEEPER

A PIRANHA SHAPE moves toward her Maddy reacts As it
drifts closer she sees that it’s just a large plastic soda
bottle half filled with sand She continues her descent

A PAIR OF OUTFLOW PIPES SLOWLY FADES INTO VIEW

As her vision clarifies Maddy sees that BOTH OF THE COVER
GRATES HAVE BEEN SHREDDED The half-inch steel slats are
CHEWED CLEAN THROUGH

Maddy’s eyes widen A few startled bubbles escape her lips
She spins around and swims for the surface

FROM BEHIND MADDY A DARK SHAPE slips from the outflow pipe
Then another

They follow Maddy’s shapely backside toward the surface
gaining steadily on her

following in a more curious fashion suddenly make their move

on Maddy One grabs onto her foot

THIRTY FEET DEEPER SEVERAL MORE PIRANHA shoot from the
outflow pipes as if alerted to an easy meal

ABOVE WATER Maddy suddenly JERKS BACKWARD Eyes go wide

He waves frantically from the shore helpless to do much else

BARRY (cont’d)
Swim C’mon
Maddy wrenches herself around in the water and HAMMERS the
nearest piranha with her flashlight Right on the snout It
releases her foot on a plume of blood

She starts swimming for shore again Slicing through the
water with perfect form

Barry wades out to grab her and haul her the rest of the way
onto dry land

They collapse into each other’s arms Barry on the bottom
Maddy on top Oddly appropriate

BARRY (cont’d)

Nothing She jiggles the handle Waits Listens

From deep inside the plumbing comes a faint SHRIEKING SOUND
Part metallic Part alien

Then a RUMBLE Coming closer Closer Then SILENCE

She puts an ear to the faucet Listening Straining to

hear if there’s anything moving in there
KOOOSH A WAD OF BLACK GUNK BLASTS OUT THE FAUCET

Her CELL PHONE propped near the tub plays CLASSICAL MUSIC

She wipes her face and body with a soapy washcloth removing the
last smudges of greasy black gunk Laying the cloth across her
pubic area she tilts her head back and closes her eyes

FROM BENEATH MADDY’S BODY
TINY FISH the size of minnows swarm up and out of the
drain They keep coming by the hundreds sweeping over her

like a cloud

The tub is now TEEMING with tiny shimmering forms totally
obscuring her body

MORE FISH pour out the faucet a seemingly endless spawning
of tiny piranha

Maddy’s knees drift apart She purses her lips Almost
enjoying the sensation of a million wiggling bodies

The phone screen has a picture of a GRINNING PIRANHA HEAD
labeled “UNKNOWN CALLER” Maddy sits up with a gasp Looks
down

GIANT RAVENING PIRANHA now fully grown are eating her from
the bottom up Below her chest there’s nothing but ribbons
of bloody flesh and stripped bone

Listen I wanted to ask one little
favor if I could

KIM KARDASHTAN
What is it

CHET
Well every year we seem to get
more kids and moms and less teenage
boys They’re saying the park
isn’t cool enough And without
teenage boys no teenage girls
know what I’m saying

KIM KARDASHIAN
I’m not sure Chet Help me out
here

CHET
I was thinking we could arrange for
a-- what do you call it--

STACEY
A wardrobe malfunction

KIM KARDASHTAN
Wardrobe malfunction

CHET

wave pool and you know

BIG DAVE
(chiming in)

CHET

Hey no problem it’s only money

palates right

KIM KARDASHTAN
Unbelievable
(stalks off)
What an asshole

Chet Stacey and Big Dave exchange glances What’s her
problem

CHET
(calling after her)
Hey it’s all good

Kim Kardashian and Charles Barkley split off in opposite
directions eager to get as far away from Chet as possible

ON HASSELHOFF He hangs back like a pro letting the crowds
come to him Stacey bounces up to him

STACEY
If I can help with anything Mr
Hasselhoff just let me know

HASSELHOFF
Don’t worry sunshine I know how
to work a crowd

He gives her a wink and climbs up onto an empty lifeguard
stand keeping just out of reach of the grabbier fans

Barry turns to Maddy with a shrug

BARRY
All seems pretty good so far
Kinda lame but good

Maddy nods still apprehensive On a sudden impulse she
pulls her phone

BARRY (cont’d)
Who’re you calling

MADDY
(into phone)
Hello Kyle

EXT WATER PARK —- LAZY RIVER - DAY 78

BATHERS on inner tubes drift slowly with the artificial
current

We DIP BELOW THE WATER to find a DRAIN COVER that appears
intact

-UNTIL WE GET CLOSER and see TINY DIMPLES bulging in the
metal surface Like something is RAMMING IT from the other

side and gnawing its way through Just like we saw in
Goodman’s aquarium

EXT WATER PARK - WATER SLIDE - DAY 79

CAMERA FOLLOWS THREE TEENS as they race down the twisting
chute laughing and spinning like break dancers

ONE-TWO-THREE-- they spit out of the tubes and into the clear
blue water of the SPLASH POOL

A SKINNY TEN-YEAR-OLD stands frozen at the top of the slide
afraid to take the plunge TWO HUGE HANDS reach down and
pluck him from the starting line

CHARLES BARKLEY
Comin’ through

Charles Barkley jumps in front and DIVES INTO THE CHUTE

FOLLOW SIR CHARLES as he whips through the turns on his
stomach flying like Superman

He BURSTS FROM THE TUBE ass-first and SPLASHES DOWN in a
spectacular cannonball

CAMERA PLUNGES UNDERWATER with him Here again we find a
PARTIALLY-CHEWED DRAIN COVER

This time a medium-sized PIRANHA squeezes out and darts off
through the rippling shadows

Charles swims back to the surface and breaches to ROUSING
CHEERS from the fans

Maddy sees Kyle’s patrol car pull up to the entrance and
walks over to greet him
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 77

Barry still in his cumbersome shark suit leans his garbage
prong against a metal trash bin and waddles after her

KYLE
(leaning against his car)
Hey Maddy Whoa--
(sees Barry in shark suit)
I’m gonna need a bigger boat

Barry quietly seethes

MADDY
Thanks so much for coming Kyle

KYLE
Sorry but I can’t stay too long
Got a mountain of paperwork to deal
with You know the drill

MADDY
I know I know Just if you
could hang around as long as you
can I’d feel a lot better

Seeing Barry cringe Kyle shows a quick change of heart

KYLE

(touches her hand)
As long as you need me

EXT LAZY RIVER — DAY 85

A FRECKLE-FACED BOY clambers out of the fake river and runs
up to his mother crying

FRECKLED BOY

Sitting on a beach chair the YOUNG MOTHER looks up from her
Kindle

YOUNG MOTHER
(clucks her tongue)
Let me see

Kid lifts his leg to show her a NONDESCRIPT CUT on his calf
Could be a bite hard to tell

YOUNG MOTHER (contd)
You just scraped it on something
Go tell the lifeguard and he’1ll get
you a Band Aid

FRECKLED BOY
It was a piranis

YOUNG MOTHER
No it was not a piranha Youve
just heard too many people talking
about piranhas Now scoot

EXT WATER PARK —- DAY 87
SERIES OF Escalating attacks

A SERIES of small yellow LANE-DIVIDER BUOYS gets pulled under
water one by one echoes of “Jaws”

A FEW RANDOM BATHERS IN THE MAIN POOL start JERKING AND
FLAILING as other bathers around them continue to enjoy
themselves splashing and swimming obliviously

SEVERAL BODY SURFERS are attacked in the WAVE POOL as the
artificial waves turn from clear to frothing pink

KIDS SHRIEK as they come off the slides and hit the SPLASH
POOL Hard to tell the happy terror from the mortal terror

FLOATERS on the LAZY RIVER are suddenly tugged through their
inner tubes screaming

LIFEGUARDS jump up in their chairs BLOWING WHISTLES to clear
the pools

All the preceding is INTERCUT WITH CLOSE-UP UNDERWATER
GLIMPSES OF GNASHING TEETH AND TEARING FLESH

And BLOOD Everywhere blood

EXT PARK ENTRANCE - SAME TIME 88

MADDY BARRY AND KYLE stiffen to the sounds of LIFEGUARD
WHISTLES and SCREAMING

MADDY
(pure dread)
Oh my God It’s happening

I warned him I warned Chet and
he didn’t listen

BARRY
What an asshole
EXT PARK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 89
Just then CHET BURSTS SCREAMING OUT OF HIS OFFICE

CHET
MY ASS MY ASS WHAT’S UP MY ASS

As Chet stumbles PAST CAMERA we see a PIRANHA TAIL flapping
between his butt cheeks

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 81

His feet get tangled in his fallen shorts tripping him up
He face-plants in front of a HORRIFIED MATRON

CHET (cont’d)
Pull it out Pull it out

The elderly woman looks down aghast With some
understandable trepidation she gingerly reaches down and
tries to get a grip on the flapping tail

CHET (cont’d)
HURRY HURRY

After a number of misses the old lady finally manages to
grab hold of the tail Starts to pull

We can only imagine what a spike-finned piranha feels like
going in reverse

CHET (cont’d)
(shrieking in pain)
NO NO NO DON’T PULL AAAGGGHHH
Chet shoves the startled woman aside clambers to his feet
and staggers off toward--

EXT MAIN POOL AREA 90

A SCENE OF TOTAL CHAOTIC INSANITY

PANICKED PARENTS run in all directions screaming
BLOODY BATHERS stumble out of the water with mangled limbs

PARK STAFFERS desperately try to help the surging number of
victims not knowing which way to turn

LIFEGUARDS frantically haul swimmers out of the pools

EXT WATER PARK - WAVE POOL - CONTINUOUS 91
ONE PARENT’S CRIES are heard above the rest

HELPLESS FATHER
Hellllp Somebody Somebody help
my daughter

CHARLES BARKLEY hears the father’s pleas Without hesitation
he jumps in the water and wades out to rescue a CRYING LITTLE
GIRL punching several large piranha that get in his way

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 82

CHARLES BARKLEY
Here I come Unstoppable baby

He grabs the little girl and hands her up to her sobbing
father

CHARLES BARKLEY (contd)
You know why that little girls
cryin’ Its ‘cause shes thinkin’
“My daddys a wussy”

KIM KARDASHIAN steps in front of a BYSTANDER whos recording
the whole bloody scene on his CAMCORDER

KIM KARDASHIAN

(ala’ reality TV)
I didn’t expect Charles to just
jump in the water like that I
have to say I’m really impressed

EXT WATER PARK — DAY 92

THE MAYHEM CONTINUES TO ESCALATE And in the eye of the
RAGING STORM we find--

DAVID HASSELHOFF-- the picture of cool perched on his
lifeguard chair like a king on his throne

He looks out across the churning waters the dead and dying
taking in the utter madness of it all

A MIDDLE-AGED HYSTERIC grabs his chair and shakes it
Moments earlier this same woman was rabidly campaigning for
an autograph

HYSTERIC
People are dying You’re a
lifeguard DO SOMETHING

The Hoff gives her an irritated look

HASSELHOFF
Two things Betty First I am not
a lifeguard never was Second
this is a problem that will resolve
itself whether I do anything or
not Once those idiots get out of
the water it’s not like the fish
are gonna follow ‘em home

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 83

The Hysteric points to the water slides A DOZEN KIDS are
still climbing up and sliding down willfully ignorant of the
dangers below

HYSTERIC
There’s still kids going down those
slides

HASSELHOFF

That my love is what natural
selection is all about

HYSTERIC
You-- you ugly ugly man
(utter disgust)
You were so heroic on TV

HASSELHOFF

It’s what we in the business
call acting

EXT WATER PARK - WATER SLIDE - CONTINUOUS 93

AT THE TOP OF THE WATER SLIDE The supply pipes that feed
water into the chute SUDDENLY CLOG

SEVERAL KIDS skid to a dry stop halfway down and immediately
start clamoring for the water to get turned back on

PLOP PLOP PLOP A DOZEN SMALL PIRANHAS spit out the pipe
opening instantly unclogging the pipe They ride down the
slide on a plume of water that joins up with the marooned kids

Together the kids and piranhas tumble freestyle down the rest
of the slide commingling through the final twists and turns

The kids blast out of the chute with piranhas attached to
faces limbs and torsoes shrieking at the top of their lungs

EXT WATER PARK - MAIN POOLS - CONTINUOUS 94

MADDY KYLE AND BARRY race up to the main cluster of pools
Kyle takes charge

KYLE
Ill take the splash pool Maddy
you take the main pool Barry--

MADDY
Barry can’t swim

Piranha 3DD —- LOCKED WHITE 32911 84
KYLE
Of course he can’t

Kyle bolts for the SPLASH POOL Dives straight into the fray
with no regard for his own safety

Maddy turns to jump into the MAIN POOL Barry grabs her arm
holding her back

BARRY
I just wanted to say -- whatever
happens -- I’ve loved you since

high school And always will
Maddy holds his gaze a beat then

MADDY
I thought you were gay
(before he can protest)
Hold that thought

Maddy gives him a quick peck on the cheek and dives into the
pool She starts grabbing stricken swimmers and hauling them
to the side where they can be reached by others perched on
the edges

ON BARRY After a few seconds of self-loathing he stirs
himself to action -- albeit less heroically -- helping to
pull the injured out of the main pool

All the while he’s watching Maddy with crushing despair

EXT WATER PARK - MAINTENANCE SHED - CONTINUOUS 95

ON XAVIER He bursts out of the storage shed brandishing his
semi-automatic Brazilian Uzi

XAVIER
(pulls up short)
Puta Madre

He takes one look at the escalating horror and does a quick
about-face Runs back behind the outbuildings

EXT WATER PARK - MAIN POOL - CONTINUOUS 96
ON MADDY She grabs for drowning victims with one hand while
punching and swiping piranha with the other Each time her
arm breaks the surface more angry slashes can be seen from

shoulder to fingertips

It’s anybody’s guess how long she can keep this up

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 85

ON KYLE He is literally CATCHING KIDS as they fly off the
slides and tossing them up onto dry ground

EXT WATER PARK -— CONTINUOUS 98

of the piranha’s tail still visible between his butt cheeks

CHET

EXT WATER PARK - WAVE POOL - CONTINUOUS 99

ON CHARLES BARKLEY He’s still plowing through the water
saving people right and left Every time he tosses a new kid
up onto the deck he shouts “You’re welcome”

He stops long enough to regard his shredded forearm chewed
halfway to the bone

CHARLES BARKLEY
You call that a bite Thats no
damn bite I been kissed harder
than that

PANICKED PARENTS AND FRIENDS jam the pool’s edge like
travelers at a baggage carousel each trying to grab for a
different loved one

As more people shove their way from the back those in the
front get PUSHED INTO THE WATER and the whole bloody cycle
repeats itself

EXT WATER PARK - MAIN POOL - CONTINUOUS 100

A CHEESY LITTLE PIRATE SHIP becomes an impromptu lifeboat for
way too many panicked bathers Those already aboard savagely
repel the newcomers With so many desperate hands grabbing
on to one side the tiny ship begins to list more and more
until it finally TOPPLES throwing everyone back into the
churning water

EXT WATER PARK - MAIN POOL - CONTINUOUS 101

ON BARRY Barry takes an elbow to the head loses his
balance almost goes in the water

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 86

Recovers then gets knocked the other way Still manages to
stay upright Barely

EXT WATER PARK - POOL SIDE - CONTINUOUS 102

ON KIM KARDASHIAN She’s down on her hands and knees
reaching out to a victim in the water Glancing up she sees
BIG DAVE leaning over the edge trying to get a snapshot down
her cleavage

She stands abruptly deliberately bumping Big Dave off balance

KIM KARDASHIAN
Whoops

Big Dave windmills for a few seconds and splashes down into the
water He is instantly set upon by ravenous piranha

EXT WATER PARK MAINTENANCE SHED - CONTINUOUS 103

ON XAVIER He bursts out of the storage shed again This
time he’s pushing a WHEELBARROW FULL OF LARGE PLASTIC
CONTAINERS On a mission But where And to do what

EXT WATER PARK - WAVE POOL - CONTINUOUS 104

ON CHARLES BARKLEY He’s now totally engulfed by piranhas
and fighting a losing battle to stay upright

CHARLES BARKLEY

or six kids

EXT WATER PARK -— CONTINUOUS 105

ON HASSELHOFF He looks down from his lofty perch high
above the fray Seems caught between conflicting impulses--
Sit here and revel in catastrophic human suffering or lift
a finger to help He suddenly notices--

THE FRECKLE-FACED KID now thrashing helplessly in the middle
of the LAZY RIVER

Hasselhoff shakes his head in disbelief
HASSELHOFF

You went back in the water
You little ginger moron

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 87

He hops down off the guard chair Grabs a RESCUE TUBE and
takes off running in SLO-MOTION toward the drowning boy

Throw in a phrase or two of BAYWATCH THEME MUSIC to brand the
moment If we must

The Hoff reaches the water’s edge dives in and comes up
swimming a perfect crawl Reaches the boy in seconds hauls
him up onto the rescue tube and paddles swiftly back to shore

In the BACKGROUND we see Chet pants around his ankles lurch
up to the Lazy River and topple face-first into the water

NEW ANGLE

The Hoff RISES UP INTO FRAME cradling the rescued boy in his
arms He is a man transformed by destiny

HASSELHOFF (contd)
(welling tears)
I saved a life today

He looks off in a heroic 34 stance (ignoring of course the
dozens of other people still dying horribly around him)

FRECKLED BOY
Can you put me down now

EXT MAIN POOL - CONTINUOUS 106

Barry paces along the edge of the main pool in his shark
suit watching Maddy fight to save the last couple of victims
flailing in the deep end

It’s clear that Maddy’s strength is on the wane and she’s
bleeding profusely With her every movement NEW PLUMES OF
BLOOD flare out from her arms and midsection

Barry brazenly RIPS OFF HIS COSTUME and starts to dive in to
help her-- but his paralytic fear of water holds him back

Maddy claws her way to the pool-side with a LITTLE GIRL in
tow Hands her up to Barry

Barry lifts the girl out of the water and hands her off to
the frantic mother Turns back to Maddy

BARRY
That’s enough Maddy Come out

MADDY

(gasping)
One more left

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 88

BARRY
You won’t make it
She shoves off from the wall and -- with her last ounce of
strength -- swims out to grab the final victim a LARGE WOMAN

WITH CURLY BROWN HAIR
Barry is beyond anxious now

BARRY (cont’d)
MADDY--

But she’s not hearing him Totally focused on her last
mission

INT PUMP HOUSE 107

Xavier uses his overloaded wheelbarrow to ram his way into
the pump room He lunges for the control panel and
immediately starts throwing levers

XAVIER
Suck on this you little beeches

The giant PUMPING MECHANISM SHUDDERS TO LIFE

EXT MAIN POOL 108
The water begins to SWIRL forming a blood-red WHIRLPOOL

UNDERWATER Water funnels down through the broken drain
cover dragging bits of shredded clothing and torn flesh down
with it Even a few of the smaller piranhas get caught in
the suction

ON MADDY She gets to within arm’s length of the last victim
-- the woman with the curly brown hair -- reaches out and
starts to sink

UNDERWATER THE SUCTION FROM BELOW is more than Maddy can

fight She’s pulled downward on swirling plumes of her own

blood

She flails a little but not enough to stop her descent

ON BARRY He gestures frantically from the pool’s edge
BARRY

Somebody help Maddy Somebody help
Maddy
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 89

Barry’s cries fall on deaf ears as everyone else seems to be
attending to their own personal horrors

And then out of the corner of his eye he sees--

KYLE running toward them Of all her possible saviors it
has to be that jackwad

BARRY (cont’d)
No
(steeling himself)
Not you
(crouching)
ANYONE BUT YOU

Just as Kyle reaches the edge of the pool and LAUNCHES
HIMSELF out over the water--

--BARRY DOES LIKEWISE going airborne like a wounded duck
Both SPLASH DOWN AT THE EXACT SAME TIME

Barry breaks the surface in a furious dog-paddle gasping
sputtering and going nowhere

He gropes for the ladder grabs hold and hauls himself back
out of the pool dripping and pathetic He whirls and runs
away the consummate loser

Kyle by contrast slices through the water like Michael
Phelps

eUNTIL THE LARGEST PIRANHA WEVE EVER SEEN chomps down on
his right arm BITING IT CLEAN OFF

Kyle CRIES OUT but keeps swimming for Maddy using a modified
side-stroke heroically undaunted

The HUGE PIRANHA circles back around and BITES OFF KYLE’S
OTHER ARM

Kyle now essentially armless is reduced to a kind of
spastic dolphin kick But still he keeps going

MORE RAVENOUS PIRANHAS attack him from all sides
Kyle finally goes down in a BLOODY FOAM

UNDERWATER Maddy is pulled toward the broken vent
powerless to fight the ever-increasing suction

Her body settles over the opening forming a tight seal that
prevents anything else from being sucked down the drain

Maddy struggles to pry herself loose from the drain but it’s
no use The last few bubbles slip from her parted lips

THE GIANT PIRANHA THAT DISMEMBERED KYLE circles Maddy once
then HOVERS in front of her face jaws gnashing hungrily

If there is indeed an “Alpha Piranha” this is clearly it
Maddy just stares back immobilized too weak to fight
BEHIND HER Kyle’s body descends through the bloody water
THE GIANT PIRANHA rears back and LUNGES FOR MADDY’S FACE--
RAMP TO SUPER SLO-MOTION AS SOMETHING LANCES DOWN THROUGH THE
WATER on a trail of bubbles COMING STRAIGHT AT US IN
GLORIOUS 3-D

It’s Barry’s GARBAGE PRONG hurled with do-or-die accuracy
ABOVE WATER - SUPER SLO-MOTION Barry completes his follow
through tipping forward on his leading foot like a javelin
thrower teetering on the edge of the pool Eyes focused

like laser beams

UNDERWATER - SUPER SLO-MOTION THE PIRANHA’S HUGE JAWS HINGE
OPEN to clamp down on Maddy’s face as--

--the SPIKE TIP BURSTS FROM ITS MILKY EYE

BARRY
He’s WALKING UNDERWATER with a heavy CINDER BLOCK tied to his

belt loop for ballast He approaches Maddy like a space
walker with slow purposeful steps

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911

He straddles her body reaches down and slides his hands
under her torso pulling her up with all his might

Inch-by-inch he pries Maddy loose from the grate

With her body cradled limp in his arms he turns and space-

walks back toward the shallow end

The pump motor spins freely again Xavier does a little

victory dance

Xavier turns to his wheelbarrow full of large plastic

--that Maddy is flat on the deck getting mouth-to-mouth from

Maddy coughs gasps and blinks back to consciousness Her

eyes focus on Barry

Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 92

BARRY
For starters you just puked in my
mouth

Maddy struggles to sit up

MADDY
That last woman -- with the curly
brown hair -- the one I was trying to

save
Barry glances back to the fast-draining pool

A BLOODY SCALP WITH CURLY BROWN HAIR SUCKS DOWN INTO THE
DRAIN with the last of the flapping piranhas

BARRY
She’s uh-- fine Doing good

Maddy smiles weakly Takes Barry’s hand in hers Squeezes

MADDY
Thank you Barry You’re the best
You and your prong

AERIAL VIEW OF THE WATER PARK (CGI-ENHANCED)

It’s like a Civil War battlefield Scores of GRIEVING
SURVIVORS crouch over the DEAD AND DYING

The pools and rivers are sucked nearly dry leaving behind
tangled clots of bodies pool toys hair and viscera

EXT WATER PARK - MAIN POOL WAVE POOL 118

CHARLES BARKLEY hauls himself upright inside the partially-
drained wave pool He’s mauled head to toe but miraculously
alive

CHARLES BARKLEY
(surveys the carnage)
It’s turrible turrible

Over this apocalyptic image we HEAR A DEEP SEISMIC
RUMBLE

MADDY sits up looks around

MADDY
What’s that

Barry pricks to the sound as well The GROUND BEGINS TO
SHAKE building in pitch and volume like an approaching
freight train

CHARLES BARKLEY still standing in the middle of the emptying
wave pool looks down at his feet puzzled as--

KA-BOOOOOOOM He’s BLOWN TO BITS

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM-- FIVE MORE DRAIN COVERS BLAST
INTO THE AIR atop FIFTY-FOOT GEYSERS OF WATER

BOOOOM A FINAL BLAST EXPLODES THE MAIN SLIDE TOWER

THE SURVIVORS can only watch in helpless horror as--

--DEAD PIRANHAS AND BARKLEY BITS rain down all around them
They smash down through table canopies food stands awnings
and car tops pelting the ground like gigantic blood bags
THE SURVIVORS scramble for what little cover they can find

getting knocked off their feet and pummeled by this biblical
onslaught from above
Piranha 3DD - LOCKED WHITE 32911 94

And then just like a spring shower it’s over An EERIE
HUSH falls across the land

KIM KARDASHIAN bends down and picks up a DEAD PIRANHA Holds
it up to her face and regards it with pure feminine revulsion

For a moment it looks like the piranha might jerk awake and
chomp down on her pretty face But no It just hangs there
like a well dead fish

KIM KARDASHTAN
Bite on this fishfuck

She winds back and FLINGS the carcass It hits a CHAISE
LOUNGE knocking it backward and releasing a SKATEBOARD that
rolls freely across the pool deck bumping into a HOT DOG
CART with just enough force to send it careening down a small
ramp toward THE LAST UPRIGHT SECTION OF

THE SLIDE TOWER

The runaway hot dog cart crashes into the base of the damaged
tower and comes to a stop The tower SHUDDERS It STARTS TO
LEAN with a GROAN OF SHEARING METAL

Kim Kardashian looks up as a GIANT SHADOW slides over her

KIM KARDASHIAN (contd)
Uh oh

The heavy structure FALLS STRAIGHT ONTO KIM KARDASHIAN
flattening her with the force of a toppling redwood

PAN THE FACES Maddy Barry and the Hoff-- reacting to this
latest shock and hoping against hope that the terror is
finally over

Maddy hears a noise and LOOKS DOWN

A PIRANHA TWITCHES its gill flaps bellowing in and out
mouth gulping It flops over several times before landing on
its stomach Then in a feat of pure Darwinian inspiration
it starts PULLING ITSELF FORWARD using its spiny front fins
as tiny grappling hooks

SEVERAL NEARBY PIRANHAS right themselves in similar fashion
and start fin-walking across the concrete

Survivors of all kinds dash frantically for--
--THEIR CELL PHONES They start feverishly recording the

historic moment on their phone cameras Knowing they’re on
the cusp of something BIG

gasping

BITES OFF THE BOY’S HEAD Kid topples over headless Mom
