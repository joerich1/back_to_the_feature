these kind of dynamics and simply folds the wallet and
puts it back into his pocket

INT 6BC BOTANICAL GARDEN - DAY 8

A lush community garden in the middle of the city
surrounded by NYC buildings Friends and family of all
ages are gathered for the ceremony standing and sitting
in a small clearing to the side The MARRIAGE OFFICIANT
a very enthusiastic man in his 40’s is standing in front
of the audience with George and Ben next to his side
smiling paying attention to every word

OFFICIANT
Welcome everybody it’s really
wonderful to have all of you here
in this oasis in the middle of
Manhattan And thank you George
and Ben for asking me to do this
And thank you two for allowing me
to do this I want you to know
that it’s an honor for me

George dries out a few drops of sweat on his forehead
with a handkerchief

( )
8

OFFICIANT
And for everybody who’s here I
would like to ask you to get rid
of everything that’s in your head
about anything else and
concentrate only on this moment
and the ceremony and these two
people who we’re about to join
together

Sitting on the chairs in the audience are Ben’s nephew
ELLIOT and his wife KATE in their 40s She reaches for
his hand

OFFICIANT (0S)
Try to stop thinking about your
jobs your marriage your
schoolwork what you have to do
tomorrow and what you forgot to do
today Let’s just focus all our
energies and all our love on
these two men here George and
Ben

A cell phone rings with a cutting edge rap song
interrupting the speech There’s laughter all around
Kate pokes her 15 year old son JOEY who immediately
silences his iPhone

OFFICIANT
Id also like to ask the audience
here to be part of this ceremony
today You are already a part of
the community that made this love
possible You have made this
moment possible

Right behind them is ROBERTO dark skin Domenican-
American early 40’s Sitting next to him is his partner
TED a good looking all American man early 30’s And
HONEY (late 50s) an old friend of the couple’s in an
elegant dress conservative but also a touch glamorous

Roberto shoots a picture with his phone while Ted fights
a yawn - maybe from a sleepless night

OFFICIANT
And so I ask all of you if you
would commit to support and honor
these two individuals in their
life and in their love and in
their marriage together

( ) 8

George raises his eyes up above as if silently thanking
God as Ben standing next to him absorbs each word with
a smile

OFFICIANT
through the bad times and the
good times through rain and
shine in sickness and in
health

There are a few other FRIENDS and COLLEAGUES and last
but not least MINDY Ben’s nervous looking older niece
who’s already crying next to her boyfriend JOHN a
friendly looking man her own age

OFFICIANT
Will you make that commitment
today

Smiles all around Honey has an enthusiastic response
while Mindy raises both arms sending good vibes Roberto
raises his iPhone registering the moment on filming
mode

ALL AUDIENCE
Yes

OFFICIANT
Now under the training that we
get there’s something I have to
ask and the answer may seem
obvious but still it is a very
important question are both of
you making this decision of your
own free will

Somebody in the audience laughs and it’s contagious
George looks at Ben both wanting to laugh

GEORGE
Yes

BEN
Yes

OFFICIANT

All right We are gathered here in
the presence of these witnesses
today with the purpose of uniting
in matrimony

George reaches for Ben and they hold each other’s hands
as they look in each other’s eyes and smile

( ) 8

OFFICIANT (0S)
-George Esteban Garea and
Benjamin Arthur Hull Let me
remind you that the contract of
marriage is not to be entered into
lightly but thoughtfully and
seriously and with a deep
realization of its obligations and
responsibilities

INT BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - DAY

The party is going PIANO MUSIC can be heard in the
background Honey walks around with a TRAY OF COOKIES

HONEY
(with a deep Texas
accent)
Please take one I made them
they’re delicious

She goes around to the grand piano where GUESTS are
gathered around George who is playing and singing BABY
YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES

GEORGE

(singing)
Well now it takes more than a
robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips for fire to
melt away the snow
Well it takes two hearts that are
cookin to make a fie grow
And baby youve got what it takes

Ben sits next to George sharing the piano seat and the
song - they sing very well together very much in tune
with each other It’s a delight to see

BEN
You know it takes alot of kissin
to make a romance sweet
Oh it takes alot of lovin to make
my life complete
Oh well it takes somebedy special
to knock me off my feet
And baby youve got what it takes

There’s laughter all around George keeps on playing and
the two sing together

( )

GEORGE and BEN
I said ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Aha ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Because it takes alot of effort to
stay away from you

And it takes more than a lifetime
to prove that Ill be true

But it takes somebody special to
make me say I do

And baby youve got what it takes

Cmon say that again honey

Youve got what it takes x5

George jazzes it up on the piano for a grand finale -
he’s a true musician The guests applaud The dogs bark
Kate starts clinking her glass

KATE
Guys guys Quiet everyone Quiet
I just wanted to say something--

ROBERTO

Ted discreetly pulls his shirt trying to shush his

partner

KATE
(in good spirits)
It is It is

KATE
When I met my husband Elliot
here

ELLIOT
Is there another one

( )

KATE
When I met Elliot you all know my
Elliot but when I met him he
was walking around with a camera
making these amazing videos with
people he met on the streets
creating scenes out of the most
ordinary situations - I’m sure
youve all seen them Anyway I
was trying to finish my first
novel and I immediately thought
wed be such a great pair two
independent spirits committed to
our art but alas he wouldn’t pay
any attention to me He had no
time for romance Actually he had
no time to eat - he was always
hungry so I started to invite him
over for left overs which was
actually food I had made specially
for him but he thought they
were leftovers One day he called
and said he was starving so I
told him to come over but this
time I had no food - just a bottle
of wine and that’s when he
finally started to pay attention
to me

Laughter Zlata and Eugenia come from the kitchen

Laughter

GEORGE
Zlata Eugenia come here get
your glasses

KATE
We started to go out and one day
he said he wanted me to meet his
Uncle Ben I asked why and Elliot
said since his mother had passed
away his uncle was his favorite
person in his family

MINDY
Thank you Elliot

KATE
Not including siblings Mindy

( )
ll

KATE
I said okay let’s meet the uncle
but I kept postponing ‘cause I
didn’t want to meet anyone I just
wanted to spend time alone with
Elliot So finally we came here
one night - you guys had just
moved into this apartment and I
met Ben and George who had made
a delicious spaghetti bolognese
for us and we drank wine and sang
and drank some more - it was just
wonderful When we left Elliot
said “I wanted you to meet them
because they’ve been together for
more than 20 years” So I
understood

Kate gets emotional tears up

KATE
Oh my God I’m gonna cry

Everybody is quiet listening Mindy starts to cry again
but Kate swallows her tears Elliot comes over and puts
his arm around his wife

KATE

I understood at that moment that
Elliot was proposing to me

(to Ben and George

raising her glass)
because you guys Your love
your dedication and your
commitment to each other are an
example to be followed May this
marriage may this love last
forever and beyond To Ben and
George

Everybody raise their glasses and toast

EVERYBODY
To Ben and George

BEN

INT ST GRACE’S SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

FATHER RAYMOND is sitting alone in the back of a large
auditorium where a choir rehearsal is taking place His
eyes are closed his head tilted down as if in prayer
In the background the voices of the chorus sing the
powerful Miserere by Allegri

Up on stage BOYS and GIRLS sing together wearing their
own casual clothes under a modern sculpture of Christ on
the cross They sing in Latin Tibi soli peccavi et
malum coram te fecci ut justificeris in sermonibus
tuis et vincas cum judicaris (Having sinned against none
other than You having done what You regard as wrong You
are just when you pass sentence on me)

It’s a very democratic group different ages races and
attitudes Each face has a story and together they give
extraordinary power to the music

In front of them George conducts with passion for the
music moving his arms mouthing some of the words that
he knows by heart

In the back of the auditorium Father Raymond continues
to pray invisible to the people on stage

INT ST GRACE’S SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY

The small administrative office of Father Raymond He is
reading from a piece of paper a computer in front of
him

FATHER RAYMOND
“All who serve in the Archdiocese
should believe in God support
belief in Jesus Christ engage in
prayer respect ecclesiastical
authority possess a basic
knowledge of the Catholic Church
not take a public position
contrary to the Catholic Church
demonstrate a public life
consistent with the teachings of
the Catholic Church--

George is sitting across his desk Both men look tense

( )

GEORGE
(interrupting)
Father You’re not going to read
me the whole Witness Statement

Father Raymond hands him the piece of paper

FATHER RAYMOND
The Christian Witness Statement
George You signed it when you
took this job

GEORGE
Father how long have we known
each other

FATHER RAYMOND
I wish I didn’t have to do this

George

GEORGE
Twelve years Twelve years
Father

FATHER RAYMOND
You must understand that

GEORGE
Understand what

FATHER RAYMOND
That day when you announced you
were getting married at the
spring semester meeting

GEORGE
You’ve all known this whole time
that Ben and I have been living
together

FATHER RAYMOND
Word got out to the Archdiocese
And then someone showed the Bishop
pictures of you and Ben in Petra -
on Facebook of all places

GEORGE
I wouldn’t have done it any
differently Father

FATHER RAYMOND
I’m not saying you should have
George But the Bishop wasn’t

happy
( )

GEORGE
What about the students I’ve
known them since they were kids I
know their parents They’ve been
to my house and played on my
piano They’ve sung with Ben and
me

FATHER RAYMOND
George you understand I signed
the same Witness Statement right
We all did it here Believe me I
wish I didn’t have to do this but
it’s not a choice for me

GEORGE
I need to talk to the students

FATHER RAYMOND
Of course I could go talk to them
with you or maybe you prefer to
go on your own It’s up to you

GEORGE
What about regionals next month

Father Raymond picks up a print out email from his desk
and reluctantly shows it to George

FATHER RAYMOND
The decision is effective
immediately

GEORGE
Oh

George takes a moment to process what’s just

Silence

FATHER RAYMOND
Let’s pray George

George stands up ready to leave

FATHER RAYMOND (CONT
It’s important that you don’t
question your faith

GEORGE
Thank you Father I believe in
Jesus Christ as my savior and
that won’t change But at this
moment I need to pray on my own

EXT ST GRACE’S SCHOOL - DAY
St Grace’s Church and Catholic school in Manhattan

The School and Church are located on a quiet street in
Chelsea lined with trees off the main avenue There’s
barely any traffic A small group of HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
in school uniform hang out outside chatting and smoking
cigarettes

The door opens and out comes George carrying a backpack
and a heavy shopping bag

He passes by the students without saying a word

It’s hot outside George walks down the street alone
sweating passing the shopping bag from one hand to
another Busy New Yorkers pass by him not noticing he
has to stop for a moment placing the heavy bag on the
ground cleaning the sweat off of his face After a
moment he picks it up again and continues on his way
disappearing down a busy avenue

INT BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT

George is pacing nervously by the piano holding a pen
He uses an old fashioned calculator that’s on top of the
piano as he scribbles something on a piece of paper

GEORGE
Let’s not forget that the real
estate agent gets a first month
commission The coop board gets
one month also and charges a 5
administration fee

MINDY
A month

Roberto Ted Honey Mindy Ben and Kate are sitting in
the living room Roberto and Ted are both in police
uniforms They drink soft drinks water and beer for
Roberto and Ted but this time it’s definitely not a
party

GEORGE
Yes

MINDY
That’s ridiculous Why do they
have to charge an administration
fee

( )

ROBERTO
They just want to discourage
rentals in the building

MINDY
I hate coop’s

HONEY
But it’s so hard to find a condo
in Manhattan

TED
Nowadays it’s not

GEORGE
Anyway I’m just trying to explain
that renting wouldn’t help us
because

George is still finishing his calculations

MINDY
Youve been to my house right
You know how much my real estate
taxes are 3000 That’s for the
whole year

BEN
It’s Poughkeepsie Mindy

GEORGE
Renting would leave us owing about
a thousand a month If we can find
a studio for 1500 dollars which
isn’t easy we’d start our month
at almost 3000 That’s including
the Cobra insurance

KATE
And you can’t afford that

GEORGE
Well between my private lessons
and Ben’s pension
George is interrupted by a knock on the door
MINDY
Why did you guys have to go on

such a fancy honeymoon

Ben gets up and walks towards the door

( )

BEN
Mindy That’s none of your
business

MINDY

Of course it is Otherwise I
wouldn’t be here

ROBERTO
Shush Mindy
MINDY
I’m just saying there’s nothing

wrong with Provincetown
Ben opens the door It’s Elliot

ELLIOT
Sorry I’m late

GEORGE (0S)
Anyway wed still have to pay one
month’s rent to the agent and one
month to the coop board right
away That’s 4600 right there out
of our pockets

BEN
Come in We’re all in here

Elliot seems surprised to see everybody there He notices
the serious mood

ELLIOT
Everything okay Uncle

BEN
Yes we just want to talk to you

George stands to greet him
GEORGE
Sit down We just want to talk to
you all We invited you all here

Elliot goes to sit next to Kate She gives him a kiss

( )

ELLIOT
Water please Are you going to
tell us you’re getting divorced
already

ROBERTO
Ha That’s what I thought also

GEORGE
No We have to sell the apartment
Weve already found a buyer so
very soon well have to move out

Ben returns with water for Elliot He and George sit
together on the piano seat with their backs to the
instrument They face their guests

GEORGE
It won’t take long for me to find
another job and for us to find an
apartment But in the meantime

BEN
It’s just for this transition
phase Probably just a week or
two

GEORGE
We need a place to stay

Elliot looks around at the Guests and at Ben and George
Nobody says anything

ELLIOT
Wait a minute Did I miss
something

BEN

The last weeks have been tough on
us Elliot Losing the job
looking for health insurance We
just need a breather

GEORGE
Believe me moving out is the last
thing we want to do

BEN
And it’s just temporary We’1l
find a new place very soon

ELLIOT

(angry)
Uncle Ben how did we get here

INT CORRIDOR OF BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT

Outside Ben and George’s apartment the guests say their
goodbye’s to the hosts

ELLIOT
I’m sorry if I was a bit rough
Uncle I’ve had a bad day

KATE
Let’s go Elliot
TED
Think positive Ben
HONEY

the week
ROBERTO

Hey buddy thanks for the beer

MINDY
Good night sweetheart

BEN AND GEORGE (0S)
Good night Good night

The door shuts The Guests walk down quietly towards the
elevator for a moment Roberto and Ted stop in front of
another apartment down the corridor

ROBERTO
We’re here

They start to say their good-byes with hugs and kisses

HONEY
I feel bad that I can’t help out
but you guys have seen my
apartment

MINDY
It’s okay They can stay with me
for as long as it’s necessary

HONEY
I just had this feeling that they
were hoping they’d stay with one
of us here in the city Didn’t
you guys see the look on their
faces

Yes they saw that look on their faces All but Mindy

( )

MINDY
What are you talking about
HONEY
I’m just saying They don’t want

to go live Upstate George and Ben
country boys all of a sudden I
can’t see that

MINDY
It’s temporary

ELLIOT
Honey is right Maybe there’s
something else we can do

MINDY
I thought we had it all figured
out already

HONEY
Shhh Mindy Quiet

MINDY
Why are we even having this
conversation I’m the only one
with the extra bedroom

ELLIOT
It’s not that Mindy It’s
Poughkeepsie

MINDY
When was the last time you were
there

ELLIOT
Doesn’t matter George has his
private students here Ben has his
galleries

ROBERTO
And they’1ll need to look for a new
apartment

HONEY
It just doesn’t make sense that
they go live 2 12 hours away

MINDY
It’s an hour and a half actually

TED
Not by bus it’s not

( )

MINDY
By car

HONEY
They don’t drive

MINDY
They can very well learn how to

HONEY
Are you really serious Mindy

MINDY
Shut the fuck up Honey You’re
not even family so you don’t get
to decide anything

They realize at this moment that they can’t let their
friends go live with crazy Mindy

TED
Pshhh Quiet They’re right
there

KATE

Elliot let’s go I still need to
do some work tonight

ROBERTO
Since we’re all here why don’t
you come inside for a minute

Roberto puts his key on the door opens it Kate holds
Elliot’s hand signaling that she wants to go

KATE
(whispers)
It’s almost 10 o’clock

ELLIOT
Honey we need to figure this out

ROBERTO
Come in please

TED
Come in

Reluctantly Kate follows her husband Elliot They all go
inside

INT BEN AND GEORGE’S APT KITCHEN - NIGHT

In the kitchen Ben is washing the drinking glasses used
by the guests He washes thoroughly slowly taking this
moment alone maybe to reflect almost meditative

George comes in quietly carrying two plates He leaves
the left over cheese on the counter and pours the left
over crackers in the trash He gives Ben a kiss on his
cheek then leaves

After Ben finishes washing the last glass he turns the
water faucet off and proceeds to wrap the leftover cheese
in plastic wrap and then puts it inside a zip lock bag
He turns the water on again and washes this last item -
the plate that carried the cheese

Ben turns the water off finally and looks around All
is clean

INT CORRIDOR OF BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT (CONT )

George leaves the door to his apartment ajar and walks
down the corridor carrying a full trash bag As he
passes by Roberto’s apartment he seems to hear voices
coming from inside He continues down towards a door at
the end of the corridor He opens it and throws the bag
down the chute On his way back he stops in front of
Roberto’s apartment for a moment He can’t make out what
people are saying but he can definitely hear voices a
woman’s voice and then a man’s voice - an argument
coming from inside the apartment He knows it’s Kate
Elliot Roberto He feels sad that it’s come to this

George goes back inside his apartment and shuts the door
behind him

The empty silent corridor with its cold light

FADE OUT

by noisily crossing the screen

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The spacious living room of this Park Slope apartment is
bright with big windows that face a tree-lined street

the trees filter the sun and cast shadows inside the
apartment in this early fall afternoon

open book lying on his chest is Ben He is shirtless
and wearing only his boxer shorts underwear His eyes are
closed his head tilted to the side - he has fallen
asleep his reading glasses dangling from his nose

The door opens and Joey comes in followed by Kate Both
take in the unexpected vision of the old man’s nearly
naked body

KATE
(whispering)
Wake him gently

( )

JOEY
You do it
KATE
(impatient)

Oh c’mon Joey

She moves gently towards the bed and gives Ben a
tentative poke He opens his heavy eye lids slowly

KATE
Uncle Ben Uncle Ben hi Sorry
to wake you Joey wants to ask you
something

JOEY
Mom

Kate steps back and gently pushes Joey closer to Ben

JOEY
Uncle Ben my friend Vlad is here
We need to do a presentation for
school and there’s nowhere for us
to study

BEN
(dazed)
Who

Vlad steps in from behind Joey curious to finally see
the old man in person

BEN
Ah Vlad it’s so good to meet
you I’ve heard a lot about you

VLAD
Hi

BEN
I’m sorry I guess I’ve fallen
asleep

He sits up but still doesn’t move to get dressed

BEN
What time is it

VLAD
205

BEN
So what is this presentation
about

( )

Ben looks at Joey who’s looking at his mother who’s
looking at him Nobody says anything

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The desk in the living room now has been taken over by
Kate and her computer Elliot is nowhere in sight Only
a few pages of notes neatly piled up next to the
computer while Kate seems concentrated writing away

BEN (0S)
Did I tell you that my gallerist
friend is a big fan of yours

It takes Kate a moment to register that someone is
talking to her

On the other side of the room Ben has created a make-
shift studio with an easel and a drawing pad He has a
few photos tacked to the wall beside him and a box of
charcoals that he is sketching with

BEN (CONTD)
Did I tell you

KATE
A fan of mine

BEN
She loves your book

KATE
That’s nice

Kate after this brief exchange is back to the computer
trying to finish that one sentence interrupted a moment
ago

Ben puts his charcoal back in its box

BEN
I need some tea Do you want some

KATE
Id love some thanks

Ben walks towards the kitchen

BEN
You remember her right

Kate types the rest of the sentence before pausing again

( )

KATE
Who

BEN
Ada My gallerist friend

Ben goes into the kitchen

KATE
When did I met her

BEN (0S)
That group show I had She’s the
owner of the gallery

KATE
In the Lower East Side Yes I met
her I think

BEN (0S)
Tall blonde
(pause)
Swedish
KATE

KATE

screamed I absolutely screamed

KATE

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT KITCHEN - DAY

Ben washes a couple of dirty dishes He cleans the
kitchen top with a paper towel He opens the top cabinet
and takes his time selecting two mugs amongst the large
selection

BEN
She had no idea you were my niece

KATE (0S)
That’s funny

( )

The kettle on the gas burner starts to steam As the
speed of the releasing steam increases the vibrations
become louder whistle and Ben turns the oven off

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kate is concentrated on her writing typing and drinking
tea

Ben is now sitting on the couch blowing invisible steam
from his cup carefully taking tiny sips of tea pensive

BEN
You know my favorite story of
yours The one about the old high
school friend who shows up at the
diner

Kate keeps on typing trying to avoid another long
interruption

BEN
She sees him but I don’t remember
why she can’t be sure it’s her
friend

Kate doesn’t take the bait She’s still typing

BEN
The worst thing about getting old
is the memory
(pause)
It only gets worse with time let
me tell you

Kate can’t let this go on much longer She stops typing
once again

KATE
She can’t see him because he’s
outside and it’s snowing

BEN
Of course He’s in the car right

KATE
She’s not really sure if it’s him

BEN
Because of the blizzard
(pause)
And then there’s that awful hit
and run at the end

( )

KATE
Right

BEN
That was shocking I really lost
my breath at that part How she
knows it’s him her old friend
even though she never really saw
him So beautiful Kate really
It’s such good writing

Ben drinks some tea and it burns his tongue

BEN
Ouch It’s hot

Kate downs her tea She glances at the computer screen
unable to actually write anything

BEN
Which is your favorite

KATE
I don’t have a favorite

BEN
That’s just like me with my
paintings I don’t have a favorite
either George does He loves that
one that hangs in our bedroom Or
used to hang in our bedroom I
gave that to him--

KATE
--on his 40th birthday I know I
love that one tooMaybe you can
start a new painting soon

BEN
That’s the hardest thing to be
honest with you Kate I brought
all my stuff but

KATE
What
BEN
Well It’s just that I can’t

really work if there’s someone
else around I can’t concentrate

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT BEDROOM - NIGHT

The door opens and Elliot comes in

( )

He is coming from work with a messenger bag and some
envelopes in hand He sees Kate in bed asleep in an
awkward position with a book on top of the covers and the
reading light on He comes to pick up the book places it
on the bedside table and turns the light off

Kate opens her eyes awake and sees Elliot going into
the bathroom

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Elliot is washing his hands in the bathroom sink He
looks at himself in the mirror for just a brief moment
and seems disappointed at his own image He looks down at
his hands again and washes them thoroughly letting
water run through them

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Elliot comes from the bathroom wearing boxer shorts and

an old T-shirt He finds Kate reading the book in bed
pencil in hand

KATE
How was it

ELLIOT
Good

KATE

And Jeremy

He gets into bed gives his wife a kiss on her cheek and
turns the other way to lie down under the covers

ELLIOT
Better than we could’ve ever
expected

KATE
See I told you

ELLIOT
I know

KATE
I called to see if you were coming
to dinner

ELLIOT
You did

( )

KATE
Left a message

ELLIOT
I didn’t even have a moment to
check my messages

KATE
That busy
ELLIOT
Yeah but we got it all in the
can
KATE
That’s great
ELLIOT

I’m exhausted

Elliot is trying to fall asleep while Kate keeps reading
next to him He turns around ends up facing her but
talks with his eyes closed afraid the light would
disturb his sleepiness

ELLIOT
Sleep baby

Kate doesn’t respond

ELLIOT (CONTD)
Sleep

Kate underlines a passage on the book Elliot finally
opens his eyes looks at her

ELLIOT (CONTD)
What’s going on Kate

KATE
Unlike you I didn’t have a very
productive day

ELLIOT
Is it Joey

KATE
Joey Joey hardly said a word to
me today but if you were around
more youd see that that’s the

norm

ELLIOT
What is it Kate The neighbor
again

( )

KATE
No Elliot It’s your uncle When
it’s loud music it’s easy to tell
them to turn it down But if it’s
Uncle Ben chatting away it’s a
lot harder to tell him to shut up

INT LAW OFFICE - DAY

A tiny hole-in-the-wall law office A LAWYER is sitting
at his desk typing on his computer

George is sitting on the chair in front of him He is

LAWYER
Your mortgage was for 480000 on
a 30 year fixed rate

holding a manila file folder with a bunch of loose papers

in it

GEORGE
Yes but we bought it for
600000

LAWYER

In 2007 is that correct

GEORGE
Yes when it went co-op

LAWYER
And we’re getting 750000 now
That’s robust

GEORGE
I thought so

LAWYER
Youre lucky things have gone up
since ‘08 Many people who bought
when you did have lost money
selling

GEORGE
But that’s why I’m trying to
understand why we are only
seeing

He opens his folder and looks through a few pages
searching for the number

GEORGE (CONTD)
Why we are only seeing 17535 in
profit

( )

LAWYER
Well to start with you have to
take into account the closing
costs which I told you about
previously

GEORGE
Can you just remind me

LAWYER
There’s the 1 New York City
transfer tax the 04 New York
State tax plus the 6 to me
that’s 60000 right there

GEORGE
I understand all that But from my
calculations

He looks down at his paperwork

GEORGE (CONTD)
that should still leave

LAWYER
Don’t forget your co-op also has
a flip tax of 25 on whatever
profit you make if you sell
before 5 years so that’s
another

GEORGE
But this is 5 years

George bangs his fist on his lap

GEORGE (CONTD)
It’s been five years We bought in
2007 and it’s 2013 now

LAWYER
But Mr Garea you didn’t actually
close until January if you
remember so that was 2008 and
they go by the calendar year so
you would actually have to sell in
2014 to avoid the flip tax

GEORGE
This is really like Kafka

( )

LAWYER
If you had been able to pay a
little more of your principle
either as a down payment or with
your mortgage As of the sale

The broker looks at his computer screen

LAWYER
-12996 is what you had paid
off of your principal Mr Garea

GEORGE
After we paid 1900 dollars every
month to the bank

LAWYER

That’s because of the amortization
schedule Your payments in the
beginning are largely going
towards the interest and only a
smaller part towards the
principal I hope someone
explained that to you previously

GEORGE
It just never sounds very fair to
me

LAWYER

Look at it this way you’ve lived
in a nice apartment for 20 years
five of that

(he catches himself

laughing awkwardly)
-or nearly five as an owner
and now you sold it at a profit
You’re getting

(looking at his

screen)
17535 dollars which is all
yours

George looks completely at a loss like a bag of heavy

stones

LAWYER
Listen I won’t charge you for
today if that is any help Well
call it a courtesy

ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT KITCHEN - NIGHT

The family is sitting at the dinner table finishing
their dinner Elliot Kate and Joey have their plates
empty while Ben still works on his meat very very

slowly

JOEY

Ours was about “mixed farming”
which is when farmers manage a mix
of different crops and animals

ELLIOT

And why is that eco-friendly

JOEY

Nobody says eco-friendly anymore

dad

KATE
It’s eco-efficient now

JOEY
No we say “sustainable”
Sustainable agriculture

ELLIOT
I see

Kate looks at Ben still cutting his
at Kate looking at Ben then at his

meat Elliot looks
own empty plate

Joey also looks at Ben’s plate then up to the ceiling

impatience starting to boil in him

ELLIOT
So why is mixed farming
sustainable

JOEY

Cause that’s when crop residues
are used to feed the animals and
the the excrements from animals
are used as nutrients for the

crop

KATE

Eewwww Your uncle is still

eating Joey

JOEY
I’m sorry

BEN
What

( )

Ben wasn’t paying attention to the conversation lost in
his thoughts while cutting the fat off his meat with an
obsessive focus

JOEY
Can I be excused I still need to
study tonight

KATE
You don’t want dessert

ELLIOT
What do we have

KATE
Strawberries and frozen yogurt

JOEY
No thanks

Joey gets up takes his plate to the kitchen sink and
leaves

Ben takes a bite Elliot looks at Kate looking at Ben
chewing slowly

INT ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Roberto and Ted’s apartment is the same size as their ex-
neighbors but a very different decor Where Ben and
George’s was thoughtfully put together with style and
art this one is simply functional Where in the other
one the piano commanded the space in the living room in
this one it’s the giant flat screen TV

The TV is on and Ted has a small control in his hand
which commands the screen He’s setting up his new Apple
TV going step by step George is sitting next to him

all your different gadgets can be
synch’ed through the wi-fi

George is not listening He’s tired He stares at his
empty bowl

GEORGE
Is there any more ice cream Ted

( )

TED

The door opens and in comes Roberto in his police
outfit with his police woman buddy DOREEN both coming
from work He carries a bag of groceries and a six pack
of beer

ROBERTO
I’m hungry

TED
Look baby I got it hooked up

up and high fives Doreen - she’s clearly one of the guys

TED
Doreen

ROBERTO

Doreen right

George stands up to shake her hand as she drowns herself
on the couch

DOREEN
Hi George

ROBERTO

TED
In two minutes

Roberto disappears into the kitchen Ted keeps playing
with the remote

George sits again and Doreen taps him on his thigh
friendly

DOREEN

treating you

GEORGE
Oh I can’t complain

DOREEN
I’ve always liked this couch I’ve
taken good naps here

( )

GEORGE

You guys

TED
I think I’1l1 have wine

GEORGE
(to Ted)
What happened to my ice cream

TED
Did you mean to ask me if I would
get you some ice cream George

GEORGE
Yes I think because you’re from
Manhasset you don’t understand
the subtlety

TED
No I understood perfectly well I
just prefer when people are
direct

A beat of silence Doreen takes the remote control from
Ted’s hands

DOREEN
Go help Roberto I’1l finish this
for you

TED

Do you even know how to
DOREEN
Show me some respect soldier
INT ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

INT ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sitting alone at the dinner table away from everybody
else for privacy George talks on the phone He looks on
as Doreen takes her boots off and drinks beer making
herself comfortably at home

GEORGE
(on the phone)
it seems like they’re just

starting dinner now () No
tomorrow I have a student in the
morning

George keeps talking on the phone and he sees Doreen
going to open the door From afar he now sees Doreen
hugging and kissing a newcomer her partner LINDA who
arrives with a BABY

( )

GEORGE (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Me I’ve eaten already () I
stopped at the diner and had some
matzo ball soup () No no

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ben is alone by the large window in the dark living room
of his nephew’s apartment All around is quiet the whole
apartment seems to be asleep - only the light from the
street outside and a quiet conversation that Ben is
having over the phone

BEN

(on the phone)
I made beef stew tonight () I
think they did They ate the whole
thing but they didn’t say
anything() No they’re very
nice but sometimes when you live
with people you know them better
than you care to - that’s all
(-)

The large empty and dark living room Silence Ben stays
by the window his profile catching the outside light

EXT ROOFTOP ELLIOT AND KATE’S BDG - DAY

Ben is behind his standing easel on this Park Slope
outdoor rooftop Around him there are only tree tops and
neighboring rooftops the sun and a nice breeze Ben
wearing his dirty painters’s apron is sketching away
with a thin paintbrush on a new canvas

He looks up and back down to the canvas

And in front of him standing proud as a statue is Vlad
wearing a tank top and holding HIS SKATEBOARD the model
of Ben’s new painting

Ben uses his fingers to blur and fix a couple of lines
redrawing details on the canvas

The noisy metal door to the rooftop opens with a CLANK
Ben raises his eyes above the canvas to see that an out
of breath and very surprised Joey is standing between him
and his subject Vlad

JOEY
What the fuck Vlad

( )
44

VLAD
I’m posing for your uncle’s new
masterpiece

JOEY
(to Vlad)
That is so gay

An awkward silence as Ben continues to paint

BEN
People have been modeling for
painters for centuries now All
kinds of people

Joey looks at Vlad one more time to see that his friend
continues to “pose” enjoying his 15 minutes of fame

VLAD
He doesn’t mean homosexual Ben
He just means stupid

BEN
Don’t worry Vlad Joey and I
understand each other

Joey walks behind Ben and looks over his shoulder at the
painting

JOEY
You’re not a good artist anyway

BEN
I know you don’t mean that Joey

JOEY
But I do If you were you
wouldn’t have to crash on a bunk
bed in your nephews house

Joey walks away A door in the distance CLANKS shut
INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - DAY
(CONTINUOUS )

Kate is writing at the desk in the living room Joey
comes in

KATE
Did you find him

JOEY
He’s on the fucking rooftop with
Uncle Ben

( )

KATE
Hey Watch your language

Joey goes into his bedroom
Kate takes a deep breath a sip from her tea and tries to

go back to her writing But soon Joey storms out of his
room

JOEY
I’m going out

KATE
And Vlad

JOEY
Uncle Ben is making him pose for a
painting

KATE
He’s what

JOEY
You heard me

KATE

Joey wait a minute I suggested
to your Uncle Ben that he take his
painting to the roof It was my
idea Don’t you see I need to
work here

JOEY
I need to go

And he leaves

INT STAIRWELL - DAY

In the dark stairwell of the building Ben is carrying
his painting box and canvas while Vlad comes from
outside helping him with all the rest easel skateboard
and the box of paintings Suddenly he stops

BEN
You okay there

The bottom of the easel got stuck on the door Vlad gives
it a little kick and the door closes with a CLANK

VLAD
We’re good

( )

Ben tries a switch on the wall but the main light

doesn’t go on

BEN
Oh well

It’s dark and Ben is careful step by step

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kate is concentrating on work typing away on her
computer when Vlad comes in loaded with Ben’s easel

painting materials and his skateboard
Kate stops writing and goes to Vlad

KATE
Vlad what were you doing up
there

VLAD
I was helping Ben with his
painting

KATE
Weren’t you supposed to be
studying biology

VLAD
It’s going to be all about this
book on seasons and migrations
and I know the book pretty well

KATE
But if you flunk the test

tomorrow what am I going to tell

your mother when she calls and

asks if you and Joey were really

studying or just playing here

VLAD
I don’t flunk

Ben arrives in his paint splashed apron carrying the

canvas with him

VLAD
Ben where should I leave this

BEN
Just leave it there I’1l take
care of it

( )

KATE
Listen Vlad when you’re here
youre my responsibility

Kate makes sure Ben is listening to this as he picks up
his easel on the floor

KATE (CONTD)
So if you have a biology test
tomorrow you should be studying
with Joey instead of taking art
lessons on the roof

VLAD
Where is Joey

KATE
He went to the library

VLAD
I guess I’1l go meet him there

KATE
I think that’s a good idea

Vlad gets his skateboard and backpack and heads to the
door

KATE
Do you want to take some food
some water or anything

VLAD
I’m okay Thank you Mrs Hull
Bye Ben I’ll see you soon

BEN
Bye Vlad

KATE
Okay Bye

Vlad leaves Kate goes back to her desk while Ben takes
the rest of his stuff into the bedroom

Kate is quietly typing away
BEN (0S)
I didn’t know they were supposed
to be studying

Kate turns and sees to her surprise Ben on the couch
with a book She keeps on typing trying to write

( )

BEN
Joey got very upset He called
Vlad “gay” in quite an offensive
fashion

KATE
Kids have broadened the meaning of
the word “gay” far beyond sexual
orientation so don’t get
offended

BEN
I didn’t really I guess it just
means ‘stupid’ now

KATE
I think you’re right

BEN
I don’t know if Joey felt left
out or what in the world was
going through his mind

Kate stops typing and closes her laptop and stands up
gathering all of her things impatient

KATE
They’re teenagers And is it
really appropriate to be using
Joey’s friend as a model

She walks towards her bedroom carrying her laptop
notebooks and pen

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT BATHROOM - NIGHT

A very steamy bathroom one can hardly see anything
inside Someone is quietly taking a very hot shower The
water gets shut off but the person still stays inside
the box for a moment as if enjoying the last drops from
the shower - a quiet meditative moment

Finally the box opens and Ben grabs a towel He starts
to dry himself off

INT MINDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A small house with bland worn out furniture and dog toys
scattered around the place It’s quite dark inside and
there are three DOGS of different breeds each lying
lazily in hisher own cushion They pretty much own the
place

( )

The phone rings Mindy enters She has a slight dazed
look on her face maybe from a nap - or a couple of
She has to get around one of the dogs to get to

martinis
the phone

and knocks her foot onto the table

MINDY
Ouch Son of bitch Ouch oh
(on the phone)
Hello () Oh hi Kate How are
you ()

As she listens she sits on the couch and grabs a

cigarette

from a pack on the coffee table

MINDY (CONT’D)

(on the phone)
Oh I’m good Everything is great -
amazing actually Yes I went to
see this chromotherapist up in
Kingston

She lights the cigarette

MINDY (CONTD)

(on the phone)
Chromotherapy () The guy talks
to you for 15 minutes then he
floats his hand all over your body
and he feels whatever type of
energy you’re lacking - physical
emotional spiritual It’s hard to
explain But he feels the energy
levels and then prescribes colored
lights to restore your balance I
was just taking a nap under a
greenish light he gave me You
wouldn’t believe it but I feel
like I’m a different person I
have much more energy and ()
Hun-hun I know And how’s Uncle
Ben () Uh-hun I know It must
be hard for him () I know I
see

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT - NIGHT

Ben in a bath robe his hair still wet is standing
outside the closed door to Kate’s bedroom For a moment
he hears her voice then knocks on the door

KATE (0S)
Come in

( )

BEN
Sorry I didn’t want to interrupt

KATE
Yes Ben

BEN
I wanted to talk about earlier

KATE
Oh no it’s fine

BEN
Are you sure

KATE
Yes I’m talking to Mindy
(a voice on the
phone)
She wants to know when you’re
going to visit her in

Poughkeepsie
BEN
Ah send her my love We can talk
tomorrow
KATE
Okay

Ben shuts the door He stands still for a moment taking
in what he’s just heard and then walks away

INT WAITING ROOM AFFORDABLE HOUSING CITY HALL - DAY

Ben and George sit in a typically bureaucratic waiting
room amongst other NEW YORKERS in search of a solution to
their housing problems The light is dim and the mood is
downcast

Ben watches an old-fashioned TV set that hangs from the
corner of the ceiling showing a day time soap opera
George is searching through the files he has in a satchel
on his lap

A door opens and a SOCIAL WORKER a woman in her 50s
enters

SOCIAL WORKER (0S)

(to both men)
Mr Garea

( )

GEORGE
That’s me This is Mr

Hull Id

like him to come with me

SOCIAL WORKER

(cool efficient)
Right this way

She motions them both to follow her

INT OFFICE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

CITY HALL - DAY

The Social Worker searches for and separates brochures
applications and other paperwork from piles on her messy

desk

SOCIAL WORKER
These apartments are city
sponsored and are currently
accepting applications Tenants
are selected by a lottery but

first you need to meet

the

criteria for the specific
development Each one has its own

She hands some paperwork in their general direction

SOCIAL WORKER
I only have one I’m sorry

BEN
We can share

SOCIAL WORKER

The city itself does not rent the
apartments If you get selected
this will be a private real estate
transaction between you and the
real estate developer understand

George is trying to Ben less so

SOCIAL WORKER
You need to contact the developer
or the marketing agent directly -
youll see the phone numbers and
other info on the list I just gave
you

GEORGE
I have a question

George pauses quite suddenly The Social Worker looks up

from her paper work expectantly

( )

GEORGE
We’re married We would be
applying together

First time he says “married” It feels funny to say that
George and Ben both look at the Social Worker searching
for a reaction and see no reaction at all she’s a NYC
Social Worker after all

SOCIAL WORKER
Okay

GEORGE (CONTD)
So for example

(reads from the list)
One bedroom in Ft
GreeneWallabout Rent 51100
Minimum income 19509 maximum
income 23240 Would that be for
both tenants

SOCIAL WORKER
Yes Both together Anything you
find interesting there check to
see if you meet the criteria and
if you do you’1l1 need to ask for
an application directly from them
Remember to include a self
addressed envelope with your
request

GEORGE
Okay

George takes a look at some of the lists she gave him A
moment of silence between them

SOCIAL WORKER
That’s all I have for now

BEN
Sounds like a good start

SOCIAL WORKER
Typically demand exceeds supply
for those apartments so we
suggest that you enter multiple
lotteries and use other means for
pursuing housing such as
classified ads online listings
brokers and word-of-mouth

GEORGE
Thank you very much

( )

SOCIAL WORKER
Use common sense and beware of
deals that sound too good to be
true

GEORGE
Thanks

The Social Worker observes Ben getting up from his chair

SOCIAL WORKER
Sir Can I ask a question

BEN

INT ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

George comes into an almost surreal scene in front of
him

( )

Ted wearing a medieval warrior hat Roberto Doreen and
Marco’s boyfriend VINNIE heavy set with a beard
wearing a heavy metal band T-shirt are sitting around
the dinner table which is covered with Dungeon and Dragons
paraphernalia the game’s navigation maze miniature
snakes monsters vampires and medieval warriors
polyhedral multicolored dices different manuals and of
course lots of beer popcorn and bags of Doritos
There’s also a bottle of Tequila

flushed from the alcohol

GEORGE

INT ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT
(CONT )

George puts a plate in the microwave and enters two
minutes on the timer

He picks up a paper towel and cleans the counter waiting
for his food as he listens to chatter coming from the
living room

jumps from his chair

You cannot because
(with excitement)

It’s a Vampire Queen

ROBERTO
(pretends a fright)
Uh What’s her challenge rating

DOREEN

DOREEN
Yes I can I’m the DM I can do

wounding

( )

DOREEN
No way

Doreen is fast and takes the baton from Roberto’s hand

ROBERTO
Give me that

Roberto grabs Doreen who hugs the baton tight so
Roberto can’t take it away from her She’s laughing but
Roberto is seriously upset

TED
Stop

Frustrated and drunk Roberto ends up pushing Doreen
and grabbing the baton and cleaning out the table
effectively messing up the whole game

TED
Oh c’mon baby

There are boos and protests from Doreen and Vinnie

They don’t even notice as in the background George
crosses the room towards the door

He opens the door and Marco is there in a camouflage
raincoat He is closing an umbrella dripping wet

MARCO
George You don’t want to go out
there my friend It’s really
coming down

George passes by him

GEORGE
Thank you I’1ll be fine

We can hear the rain falling heavily outside

ELLIOT
Do you think he’s old enough to
enjoy the Louvre

KATE
He’s obsessed with the French
Revolution

( )

ELLIOT
But he doesn’t need to go to Paris
to learn about the guillotine

It’s a group of eight boys and
girls and they need two more so
they can get the discount

shuts the water and looks at Elliot confounded by the
intrusion

cry

GEORGE
I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry

GEORGE
I talked to the Principal there at

smart He really wants to bring
back a music program

BEN
Do they have the budget for it

GEORGE
Not right now but he seems like
he might be very good at raising
money He has a very attractive
personality

BEN

GEORGE
I haven’t finished my story Can I

Asians This really cute girl
Filipino I think she was She
played Frere Jacques for me on her
flute

BEN
George why don’t you come down
here so I can hear you better

GEORGE
It’s a bunk bed

BEN
So

GEORGE
You told me Joey was already
losing his patience with you Can
you imagine if you broke his bed
trying to shag your husband

BEN
I have missed having your body
next to mine too much to have it
denied to me for reasons of bad
engineering

He

awkwardly maneuvers himself on to the ladder and down the

side

Ben is squished as far as he can be to the wall waiting

for George with the sheets pulled back

George gets into the bed with him

They take each other in for a long moment

GEORGE

Do you ever blame me for all of

this

BEN

Why would I blame you We did it

together

( )

GEORGE
But I knew what might happen I
knew more than you what we were
risking

BEN
All I know is that after 39 years
it’s hard to fall asleep without
you This situation we’ve gotten
ourselves in is really fucking
with my sleeping patterns

INT PIANO STUDENT’S HOME - DAY

A YOUNG GIRL plays at the grand Steinway piano in this
upper middle class apartment Even though the metronome
on top of the piano is giving a certain rhythm the Girl
seems to be following no one in her interpretation of
this Prelude by Chopin

George walks around the Girl and the piano listening
carefully And as soon as the Girl finishes

GEORGE
What happened

The Girl looks at him somehow surprised at his reaction

GEORGE
What was that That wasn’t what
we talked about last week

GIRL
Interpretation

GEORGE
Yes and I insist that it is
crucial to let the music take you
someplace to be surprised by it
even to allow yourself to be
overwhelmed sometimes That is as
important as knowing the
difference between a semitone and
a half-step But at the same time
you have to stay focused on the
instrument you’re playing and
listen Always - listen What is
the metronome telling you

(clap his hands)
tik - tok - tik You-ha-ve-to-
-fol-low You can’t just create
your own rhythm to Chopin Let’s
do it again

( )

The Girl is back at the Prelude George paces back and
forth for a moment listening then sits on a bench
behind her He sees when the Girl’s MOTHER shows up
quietly discreetly peeking from the corridor smiling
at George and listening

The Chopin Prelude soars The girl plays it well George
listens with attention to the music and seems moved by
it

GEORGE (VO)
Dear parents
By now you have all heard of my
joyful news and of my sad news
To be able to finally marry my
partner of almost 40 years
Benjamin Hull in a small ceremony
here at the New York City Hall was
one of the happiest moments of my
life Unfortunately later I found
out that I could no longer
continue to teach music at St
Graces

INT ST GRACE’S SCHOOLCLASSROOM (DOCUMENTARY STYLE) -
DAY

A PRIEST drawing numbers of an equation on the
blackboard teaching math to a class

At their desks the UNIFORMED STUDENTS some paying
attention some absent-mindedly looking out the window
others making notes

The Chopin Prelude continues to play over these scenes

GEORGE (VO CONT)
Most of you and everyone at the
school knew that I was gay and
that Ben was my life-long partner
I have always had nothing but
support from all of you so I
would like to thank you and also
to emphasize that I understand
that what happened is not the
fault of St Grace’s and its
leadership

INT ST GRACE’S SCHOOLHALLWAY - DAY

Students in the hallways at their lockers some running
while others confering with a teacher and with each
other

GEORGE (VO CONT)
Above all I urge you to take this
opportunity to have a conversation
with your children about whether
or not justice was served here

INT ST GRACE’S SCHOOLGYMNASIUM - DAY

A basketball court the boys sweating playing
competitive

INT ST GRACE’S SCHOOLAUDITORIUM - DAY

Students get ready for a dress rehearsal They put on
their gowns and walk up the steps of the chorus

GEORGE (VO CONT)
The last thing I want them to take
from this is that they should hide
who they are or what they think
if they believe it will get them
into trouble Life has its
obstacles but I’ve learned early
on that they will always be
lessened if faced with honesty

The students arrange themselves on the steps playfully
at first but gradually become solemn and organized as
the new CONDUCTOR seems ready to start the music

INT CORRIDOR OF BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT

George walks the same corridor of his old apartment
towards Roberto’s door

GEORGE (V0 CONTD)
I believe the world is a better
place if people arent lying
In the words of the apostle Paul
to the Corinthians “Love does not
delight in injustice but rejoices
with the truth” Yours sincerely
George Garea

The Chopin Prelude ends as George opens the door and
goes inside

sitting next to each other on his bed with some books on

saw a wonderful movie

( )

KATE
What did you see

BEN
The Gangs All Here

ELLIOT
No way

BEN

Do you remember

ELLIOT
(sings)
But the thing that led to love
was her polka dot gloves
while the band played the polka
dot polka

They laugh It helps clear the air

KATE
What is that

BEN
A Busby Berkeley musical

ELLIOT
It’s like an acid trip with Alice
Faye and Carmen Miranda The
dancers hold these huge bananas
(demonstrating)
right here on their hips like
they have huge penises

BEN
Oh not really It’s not like
that

ELLIOT

Yes it is It’s totally phallic

KATE
I know that scene

BEN
They have a wonderful new print
And I have to say Elliot I was so
happy when they came out with VHS
we could watch all those old
movies again and I’m glad I
showed them to you But watching
this in the big screen it’s
something else It’s not even the
same movie

( )

ELLIOT
Id love to see it

KATE
Let’s go tomorrow night

ELLIOT
Yes No shit I can’t tomorrow

You were worried he was too
antisocial you even took him to
see a therapist

KATE
So

BEN
Now he has a friend

( )

ELLIOT
It’s a little strange

KATE
There’s nothing strange

ELLIOT
It’s his only friend and the
guy’s a lot older

KATE

He’s 16 he just looks older
ELLIOT

They’re like Yogi Bear and Boo-

INT JOEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ben is in bed tucked under the sheets with a book only
his reading light on After a moment he believes he can
hear a faint lament coming from above He puts the book

to rest on his chest

BEN
Joey

Joey is lying on his bed above

JOEY
Huh

BEN
Are you awake

( )

JOEY
Yes

BEN
Can I ask you a question

JOEY
What

The fact that they’re not face to face in the semi
darkness makes this easier to ask

Silence

BEN

Have you ever been in love
JOEY

I’m not gay
BEN

I didn’t mean to imply that Joey

JOEY
So what do you mean

BEN
Love You know what love is

JOEY
There was this girl once
(he proceeds
cautiously)
I was 14 We were on vacation in
Saint Croix That’s in the Virgin

Islands

BEN
I remember when you guys went
there

JOEY

There was another family renting a
house on the same beach as ours
They had a daughter she was 16
and I used to watch her go
windsurfing every morning

BEN
Did you go windsurfing too

JOEY
No we had jet skis But I used to
watch her from the beach and one
day I saw her watching me too

( )

BEN
On the jet skis

JOEY
Yeah I saw her looking at me

BEN
Do you know her name

A long pause The silence is intimate between them

JOEY
No We never said hello to each
other

BEN
Oh

JOEY

But I think we’ll see each other
again They’re from New York City

BEN
And if you do would you say hello
to her this time

JOEY
I don’t know

BEN
I think you should

Ben turns his reading light off All is quiet the room
is dark

EXT ROOFTOP ELLIOT AND KATE’S BDG - DAY

On a used palette full of different colored spots some
green paint is mixed with a little brown The result is a
dark green so the brush adds a little cream and the mix
become the perfect color for the Park Slope outdoors

Ben sits on his portable stool painting the canvas on
his easel

The painter starts to fill up the contours of his picture
with green and blue

It is a breezy quiet afternoon
The Skateboarder at the center of the painting seems to

be done and the trees rooftops and sky around him start
to gain life with brush strokes of color

EXT ROOFTOP ELLIOT AND KATE’S BDG -- END OF DAY

The light has changed it’s later in the day now Ben
applies subtle brush strokes to the canvas in front of
him With his finger he rubs the fresh mix of green and
brown on the painting for effect He takes a step back
to look

Ben looks at the sky A wind blows sending dead tree
leaves flying through the air

INT STAIRWELL - END OF THE DAY

Ben opens the door from the roof to the stairwell loaded
with his painting materials carrying his canvas a box
and the easel all at once The security door to the roof
shuts and suddenly Ben can’t move The bottom of the
easel is stuck in the door

He looks down to see the stairwell of the building
looming underneath He tries to pull the easel past the
door but it doesn’t move Little drops of sweat start to
show on his forehead

He gives up trying to do everything at once and places
the canvas on the floor then he kicks the door with his
foot He is now able to get the easel past the door
which closes with a loud clank

He leaves the canvas behind and carries the easel and
the rest with him down the stairs

It’s still a lot to carry and the place is dark He
stops midway A drop of sweat rolls down Ben’s forehead
He gets nervous and takes a deep breath His eyes get
foggy he has a hard time focusing them The air gets
rarer Ben feels faint and takes a deep breath The
stairs seem to move from under his feet

First the easel drops then the box which opens and all
the painting materials roll down the stairs

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
In the waiting room of the hospital Roberto in his

policeman uniform Kate and George are crowded around the
DOCTOR all ears on each word he says

DOCTOR
The shoulder is a ball-and-socket
joint

(MORE)

( )

DOCTOR (CONTD)
the ball of the upper arm bone
fits into the socket in the
shoulder blade and is kept there
by the rotator cuff He had what
we call a full thickness tear or
a complete tear

GEORGE
Can he paint

DOCTOR
No I don’t want him to even comb
his hair for a while

GEORGE
Poor Ben

KATE
His legs are okay

DOCTOR
Legs are fine

KATE

It was so hard to get him to stand
up and move I thought he had
broken his leg he was in so much
pain

DOCTOR
He dislocated the shoulder which
means his arm came out of the
socket and that is very painful
so any action any movement with
the body makes it even worse

ROBERTO
What about surgery

DOCTOR
I wouldn’t recommend it right
away First he needs to rest
Were going to put his arm ina
sling and he should just let it
rest for a couple of months Then
well try some strengthening
exercises and physical therapy
Now George when was the last
time he had a full cardiac

checkup

GEORGE
We have our regular checkup every
year

( )

DOCTOR
You have to take him to see a
cardiologist
GEORGE
Why
DOCTOR

It’s not okay for anyone to be
having fainting spells especially
not at his age

ROBERTO
I thought he’d just fallen down
the stairs

DOCTOR
No he fainted

GEORGE
He’s felt dizzy before

DOCTOR
And shortness of breath

GEORGE
Maybe I think so Did he complain
to you Kate

KATE
No Doctor finish please

DOCTOR
A heart condition would explain
the dizziness and the fainting
spells and nowadays heart surgery
is so advanced Anyway I’m not
going to speculate here I’m an
orthopedist I’m not a
cardiologist

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ben a large band-aid above his eye his right arm on a
sling is propped up on the couch with two pillows
reading a book

Kate comes from the kitchen with a glass of water and
some medication

KATE
Here You should take this now

( )

BEN
Oh thank you

KATE
I have to leave but there’s a
plate of pasta for you in the
microwave

BEN
Thank you Kate

KATE

okay

BEN

Oh yes I’m fine

KATE
Okay then

Kate grabs her purse makes sure she has everything she
needs and walks to the door

KATE
Bye bye now

BEN
Bye

The door closes behind her Ben is alone in the
apartment With some difficulty he moves on the couch to
reach the medication and water He drinks a couple of
sips and takes a deep breath before slowly returning to
his previous position He picks up the book and starts
reading again

EXT STREETS OF BROOKLYN - DAY

Kate approaches a corner with a stop light She waits for
a couple of cars to rush by but crosses the street right
after without waiting for the light to turn She
continues to walk fast in a hurry to get somewhere on
time

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY (CONTINUOUS )

Kate crosses the street in a hurry and rushes inside the
gates of this private High School in Brooklyn - an old
big building a place that exudes tradition and solid
education

INT HIGH SCHOOL THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

A small room with books and files everywhere Kate is
sitting on the guest chair in the Principal’s office The
PRINCIPAL leans on her busy desk while talking to Kate

PRINCIPAL
I don’t want you to worry too
much it’s not a very big deal We
deal with similar problems every
day here But it is serious

KATE
I’m shocked He’s such a serious
kid and such a good student And
so is Vlad

PRINCIPAL
There’s been some rivalry between
the two senior classes It started
between two students but then it
trickled down to everything from
who’s the most popular to who’s
the smartest Maybe it’s something
related to this but I don’t
really know Did you notice
anything different

KATE
No Maybe Actually now that I
know this

PRINCIPAL
What

KATE
Last night he watched a DVD with
me It was my pick - a French
movie and Joey usually would
never sit for the whole thing He
seemed very interested and stayed
until the very end We even had a
conversation about it after That
was sort of unusual

PRINCIPAL
Vlad has confessed that he took
the books out and gave them to
Joey but your son denies having
them

KATE
Vlad seems to have great influence
on my son Joey doesn’t have that
many friends

( )

PRINCIPAL
Have you noticed any new books in
the house

KATE
I haven’t paid attention I’m
trying to finish my new book And
Elliot’s Uncle Ben is staying with
us sleeping in Joey’s room It’s
a bit of a complicated situation

PRINCIPAL
Well I don’t understand why they
would steal these books they’re
all French literature books

KATE
I have no idea

PRINCIPAL
Truth of the matter is that the
books need to be returned to the
library You can tell your son we
won’t ask any questions now But
if they’re not returned Joey will
not be able to graduate Do I make
myself clear

INT ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT LIVING ROOM - END OF THE DAY

A tense dinner at the Hull home tonight The family is
sitting around the table their plates empty after
dinner Ben is the only one still eating It’s only
pasta but having his right arm on a sling and trying to
use the left hand only doesn’t help

ELLIOT
This is the last thing I expected
from you Joey The last thing
You’re not a boy anymore you’re a
man You’re lucky this happened in
high school so the principal can
call your mother In the real
world you would’ve gone to jail

JOEY
But I didn’t steal anything

A cell phone rings It’s Elliot’s and he picks it up

ELLIOT
(on the cell)
Hello

KATE
Ben some more water

BEN
Yes please

Kate serves Ben water then herself For a long moment
there’s silence at dinner Ben is slowly eating his food
Joey plays with his fork and Kate is observing Elliot
who listens to the caller on the other end of the line

( )

ELLIOT
(on the cell)
No let’s just go with what we
have I don’t want to make changes
at this point

Still more silence

ELLIOT
Where was I

Ben looks around mouth full of pasta - nobody but him
seems to remember He chews and swallows

BEN
Jail

ELLIOT
Yes You have a father anda
mother who taught you all that is
right and wrong There’s no excuse
for this Look at your mom Look
at her Do you think your mother
deserves to be called in the
middle of the day to hear that her
son is involved in some kind of
robbery I mean what’s going to
be next carjacking

Joey doesn’t answer He’s done with dinner he’s ready to
get up But Uncle Ben’s plate is still full of pasta

ELLIOT

ELLIOT
(to Joey)
You don’t sound very sure Is he

JOEY
Not that I know of

ELLIOT
Not that you know of You’re
together all the time The only

KATE

(to Joey)
You don’t want any dessert

( )

Joey looks at Ben’s plate the only one still eating Ben
becomes self-conscious

BEN
It’s okay I’m almost done I’m
SOrry
KATE
(to Joey)

Okay then You can go
Joey gets up and leaves

ELLIOT
Unbelievable
(to Kate)
You’re too nice to him

KATE
You don’t even know

Kate gets up and starts cleaning the table taking the
dirty plates to the sink Elliot follows and looks for a
clean container for the leftover pasta

Ben stops eating and puts his fork down

BEN
I know where the books are

Elliot is rinsing dirty dishes in the sink while Kate is
dumping bits and pieces in the garbage

BEN
I said I know where the books
are

( )

Elliot and Kate stop what they’re doing and turn to Ben
who looks down at his plate not able to face them right
now

BEN
I’ve been in the house by myself
unable to work to paint or do
anything I was looking for
something to read and I found
these books under my bed so I
picked one up

KATE
Ben Why didn’t you say something

BEN
I didn’t think much of it They
were just books

ELLIOT
Are those the books

BEN
The one I picked up was Cyrano de
Bergerac My French is a little
rusty but I got most of it I
know the book so well

KATE
Frankly who cares Ben

ELLIOT
Those are the books

KATE
(angry to Ben)
Youve been listening here the
whole time you should’ve said
something

ELLIOT
Calm down Kate He didn’t know

KATE
You think I’m too nice to Joey

ELLIOT
Oh please Kate

KATE
Well let me tell you you’re too
nice to your uncle Elliot And
it’s very easy being nice when
you’re not the one who’s around
all day

( )

Kate drops the plates in the sink and walks out Elliot
follows her

Ben alone at the table can hear them knocking on Joeys
bedroom door He can hear the door opening and then a
loud BANG - the door slams shut Kate’s and Elliot’s loud
voices muffled And Joey’s shouting his voice full of
teenage emotion

The rest of the food remains untouched on Ben’s plate He
feels bad and can’t really eat anymore He can hear the
door slam open and everybody’s voices loud and clear
now

JOEY (0S)
Because were the only ones who
will ever learn French and read
those books in this stupid school
Including the dumb ass teacher

KATE (0S)
That is so arrogant

ELLIOT (0S)
Not even It’s just plain stupid

Suddenly Joey bursts in the kitchen his face red with
rage his voice trembling with anger

JOEY
What the fuck Uncle Ben

Elliot comes right after and grabs Joey by the arm
ELLIOT
Don’t talk like this to your
uncle
JOEY
You guys talk like this all the

time

ELLIOT
Say you’re sorry

Joey is almost crying Kate comes in holding some books
ELLIOT
Joey you know you won’t graduate

unless these books are returned

JOEY
I’m sorry

ELLIOT
The trip to Paris this summer
Forget about it

INT ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A party at Roberto and Ted’s The apartment is crowded
with people - men and women friends of the couple -
chatting drinking beer laughing and being social

George sits on the couch alone with a drink in his
hand observing the scene He sees in the corner of the
room TWO MEN having what seems to be a heated
conversation which quickly turns into an argument Some
people around them look on and they realize that this is
not the place nor the time to be having this
conversation They rest their case for a moment One of
them IAN attractive early 30s goes into the kitchen
The other one a MAN IN HIS 40s is clearly upset He
suddenly turns around and walks out the door George
witnesses the whole scene from the couch

Ian comes back from the kitchen with two beers and walks
around looking for his friend He looks and looks but
doesn’t find him Disappointed he ends up on the couch
next to George

IAN
Would you like a beer

George notices a countryman in Ian’s heavy British
accent

GEORGE
No thank you

IAN
I got an extra one for my friend
and now I can’t find him

GEORGE
I think he left

Ian realizes George was witness to his scene with the
guy He places one of the beers on the coffee table in
front of him and keeps the other one drinking a sip

IAN
We had an argument
(pause)
I’m Ian by the way

GEORGE
George I’m a friend of Roberto’s

( )

IAN
Who’s Roberto
GEORGE
Well I think this is his party
IAN
Oh right I don’t know anybody
here
GEORGE
That’s Ted over there The cute
one He’s Roberto’s boyfriend
IAN
Yes I met Ted Not my type
GEORGE
They’re both cops believe it or
not
IAN
Really Gay cops
GEORGE
We call them the Police Women
Ian laughs

GEORGE (CONTD)
Terrible isn’t it But they are
actually both very nice Roberto
is not here yet he’s still at
work

Pause George has a sip of his drink Ian looks on at the
people coming and going for a moment

GEORGE
Where are you from

IAN
Chippenham originally Near
Bristol

GEORGE

South London myself but moved to
New York when I was a teenager

IAN
Did you come alone

GEORGE
With my mother

( )

IAN

I mean to this party tonight
GEORGE

Ah Yes
IAN

Do you live in Chelsea also

GEORGE
For the moment yes

IAN
I live in the Village I was on my
way to have dinner with my friend
and he said let’s stop by this
party first I said sure and now
he left and well here I am

GEORGE
You must be hungry

IAN
What

GEORGE
I said you didn’t have dinner so
you must be hungry

IAN
Starving You

GEORGE
Yes Hungry as Rodolfo

IAN
Rodolfo

GEORGE
From La Boheme The opera
(pause)
Sorry I don’t mean to be
pretentious

IAN
Rodolfo the poet of course He’s
so hungry and poor that he burns
his own manuscript for fire

GEORGE
That’s right

Another pause Ian looks at George looking at the scene
in front of him

( )

IAN
Should we go eat

GEORGE
Right now

IAN
Why not I don’t have to stay
here Do you

GEORGE
Well I

IAN
Sorry you don’t even know me
It’s just that I hate to eat
alone Don’t you

GEORGE
No on the contrary I’m never
bored with myself whereas people
sometimes can drive me crazy

Ian gives no response - does that mean George wants to be
alone He takes a sip of his beer and George looks at
him

GEORGE
Don’t get me wrong I love people
It’s crowds I have a problem with
I prefer to relate one on one
than to just stand there with a
drink in your hand and a smile on
your face

IAN
I know what you mean
(pause)
Are you waiting for Roberto

GEORGE
Not really I don’t think Roberto
will miss me when he gets here

IAN
Oh you’re waiting for someone
else

GEORGE
It’s not that romantic of a
situation

IAN
So what are you waiting for

( )

GEORGE
I’m waiting for the orchestra to
play its last note so the curtain
can fall

IAN
Are you high

GEORGE
Hardly Before I started talking
to you I was about to doze off

IAN
That’s not the best place to
sleep

GEORGE

And yet you’re sitting on my bed

George looks at the people coming and going as Ian looks
at him A moment of recognition in Ian’s face

IAN
You’re homeless

GEORGE
(laughing)
Yes it’s a long story It starts
with me marrying my partner of 39
years and getting fired We’re
looking for a place we can afford
but I won’t bore you with details

IAN
Well I happen to have right here
in my pocket the key to a rent
controlled apartment on Morton
Street in the West Village soon
to be vacated

GEORGE
How come
IAN
It’s a long story Should we go

eat

George a bit reluctant looks on to see that Ted is in
the middle of a loud group drinking and laughing The
party goes on and they won’t miss him

IAN

C’mon I don’t feel like staying
here and neither do you

( )

Ian gets up and walks away

Already close to the door Ian stops and turns He sees
that George is coming after him

INT APT IN THE WEST VILLAGE - NIGHT

A small but very comfortable cozy living room of an old
apartment in the West Village The place feels well lived
in very quiet functional with personality George
looks around and Ian picks up a few items that were out
of place

IAN
My uncle used to live here before
me so after he moved back to
England I got the lease from him
That was 20 years ago and I’ve
been very happy here I love this
place

GEORGE
So why are you leaving

IAN
Because of work I got a job with
the Anthropology Museum in Mexico
City

GEORGE
That’s an amazing place

IAN
You’ve been there So you know it
doesn’t get much better than that
for an archaeologist Do you want
something to drink

GEORGE
Just water

While Ian goes away to get some water George looks at
the books and pictures on the shelves along the wall
Pictures of Ian in a Mayan city in Central America in
Paris and Ian with the older guy seen at the party ina
romantic embrace on a beach

Ian comes back with water sees George looking at the
picture

GEORGE
That’s the guy

( )

IAN
Yes John We’ve been going out
for about a year I told him about
Mexico tonight and he wasn’t
happy

GEORGE
You’re a heartbreaker

IAN
On the contrary When I first met
him I was so in love I didn’t
want to leave his side Unlike
many gay men I’ve never been
afraid to show my feelings So I
think I scared him off a little
He never wanted to commit really
and kept pushing me away It’s no
coincidence that I interviewed for
this job in Mexico Now he finds
out that I’m leaving and he
decides that I’m the man of his
dreams It’s so typical and so
disappointing frankly

George goes to the window to see the view

IAN

Do you know how much I pay here
GEORGE

No idea
IAN

I’m even embarrassed to say
Eleven hundred They can’t raise
the rent too much It’s controlled
by the city

GEORGE
Bless this city

Outside the faint light of old lamp posts illuminate a
large beautiful internal patio - one of those old-
fashioned buildings A sense of peace fills George and

he smiles

INT CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

A SINGER sings in Latin a beautiful solemn piece of
music He is accompanied by a PIANIST and a few OTHER
MUSICIANS on this elegant stage

( )

The small theatre has an intimate feeling the audience
is composed of music lovers of all ages MUSIC STUDENTS
and OLD TIMERS mixed with NOVICES who came to listen to
Durufle’s music for the first time

Amongst them are Ben and George dressed in jackets and

ties - Ben with a bow tie stylish even if his arm is in
a sling (a dark blue sling that goes with his dark blue

tie)

The music takes a romantic turn Ben looks at George - he
knows that’s his favorite part George keeps his
attention on the stage but brings his hand down to
George’s side as they discreetly hold hands

EXT CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

A small crowd of serious CONCERTGOERS come out from the
side door to the Concert Hall Ben and George are amongst
them

They walk down the street George is humming the music

BEN
So what did you think

GEORGE
Not bad though she was milking it
a little

BEN
Did you think so

GEORGE
With a piece as romantic as that
you don’t need to embellish

BEN
I don’t know I loved it I kept
thinking about him and his beloved
Isabella

GEORGE
That’s not true though That
whole he-wrote-it-to-convince-her-
parents-to-let-him-marry-her
that’s a myth you know

BEN
I’m not like you though I prefer
a little embellishment

INT JULIUS BAR - NIGHT

George and Ben are on stools at the bar George tries to
catch the BARTENDER’s attention with no success They
are a little out of place among the mostly young and hip
PATRONS

More YOUNG PEOPLE start to arrive chatting flirting
moving around

The Bartender comes to help Ben and George

GEORGE
Finally

BARTENDER
I’m sorry I’m sorry You guys
look very thirsty What can I get
you

GEORGE
Scotch on the rocks for me Vodka
tonic with half a lime and no ice
for the gentleman here
Ben smiles George knows him well

GIRLS flirt with GIRLS who dance with BOYS who flirt with
BOYS

The Bartender brings the two drinks

GEORGE
How come it’s so busy here
tonight
BARTENDER
Thank God it’s Friday
GEORGE
(to Ben)
The kids have taken over our spot
BEN
Good for them
BARTENDER
Are you guys new in the

neighborhood

( )

BEN
Are you kidding There was a
famous “sip in” that happened
right here in this bar to
challenge the New York State
regulation that prohibited bars
from serving homosexuals

BARTENDER
Sure we have a clipping from The
New York Times framed here
somewhere

Ben points the finger to himself

BEN
1966 Me and four other guys We
came here accompanied by five
reporters and when we were denied
service we denounced the State
Liquor Authority

BARTENDER
Oh my God You’re the guy

BEN
I’m one of the guys

BARTENDER
Wow This round is on me fellows

The Bartender goes to help other Patrons George and Ben
pick up their drinks and turn their backs to the bar
They try to hold it in but soon start to laugh

GEORGE
You’re such a liar

BEN
What

GEORGE
You’1l do anything for a free
drink

BEN
But I knew the guy who did the sip-
in

GEORGE
Frank

BEN

That was his claim to fame

( )

GEORGE
(raising his
eyebrows )
I thought his claim to fame was
something else

BEN
Oh that too God bless him

George raises his glass

BEN
Here’s in memory of Frank

They toast and drink up

BEN
And to Ivan

GEORGE
And who is that

BEN
The angel from Chippenham who got
us the apartment

GEORGE
It’s Ian

BEN
Ivan Ian doesn’t matter I’1l1
drink to him the handsome

stranger

GEORGE
Do I hear some jealousy in your
voice

BEN

I have wondered what you’ve been
doing with all your free nights
without me

GEORGE
That’s not for me Ben You know
that

BEN

For all these years

GEORGE
For all these years

( )

BEN
Amazing I’m sorry I can’t say the
same to you George But at least
Ive always been honest

GEORGE
Sometimes I think that ignorance
would have been a lot easier

BEN
I’m sorry George

George takes a long sip observing the young people

around them

GEORGE
(softening)
But now that I think about it
some things you couldn’t have
hidden even if you wanted to

BEN
What are you talking about
GEORGE
I’m talking about the time you got
crabs
BEN
Oh thanks for reminding me
GEORGE
And a black eye that night in
Rio
BEN

That was a crazy motherfucker
trying to rob me

They laugh George raises his glass

GEORGE
To all the strangers

BEN
Particularly the ones that bring
us a rent controlled apartment in
the Village Cheers

A toast and the party goes on

The CROWD drink and flirt swaying to the beat of
music a happy bunch

the

EXT WEST VILLAGE - NIGHT

Ben and George walk silently side by side on the quiet

streets of the West Village at night

As they’re about to cross the street Ben stops for a
moment taking a deep breath George notices it and

holds his arm

GEORGE
Are you okay

BEN
Felt a little dizzy

GEORGE
Too much to drink

BEN
Yes I’m fine now

George lets go of Ben’s arm and they cross the street

Side by side they walk on a side street towards 6th Ave

BEN
George

GEORGE
What

BEN

Remember we used to go to Castelli
and Mary Boone and you’d say that
one day we’d go there to see my
one man show

GEORGE
And we will

BEN
No we won’t George

GEORGE
How do you know Nowadays you read
about a new “hot artist” every
week

BEN
Okay maybe it will happen but not
in my lifetime

GEORGE
How do you know It’s all a matter
of taste and trends

(MORE)
( )

GEORGE (CONTD)
Some new curator might look at one
of your paintings one day and
think it’s the greatest thing

BEN
I just would like to know Is that
disappointing to you

GEORGE
Not at all I say it because I
believe it’s a real possibility
but it’s not important to me I
love your paintings and I don’t
really care what other people
think

BEN
I guess I did make a couple of
good ones didn’t I

They arrive at the Subway Station by the Waverly Diner on
6th Avenue

BEN (CONTD)
We’ve had our ups and downs
George and I know I wasn’t always
the best husband to you

GEORGE
Id rather be your husband Ben
than anyone else’s in the world
And if I had a chance to go back
in time I would live the same
life all over again I wouldn’t
change a thing

George takes Ben’s hand and they walk down the Subway
Station

INT SUBWAY STATION 6TH AVE - NIGHT

There’s minimal traffic this time of night inside the
station Even then maybe out of habit George and Ben
find a dark private corner to say goodbye next to an
empty ticket booth

It’s time for them to separate for the night They reach
out to embrace each other made only slightly awkward by
the sling on Ben’s arm

BEN
Ouch

( )

GEORGE
Sorry

BEN
Careful with my arm

A YOUNG COUPLE walks by without noticing them

They walk towards the entrance to the trains Ben passes
though the turnstile with his card

BEN
Good night George

GEORGE
Night Ben

George watches as Ben waves and disappears down the
platform

FADE OUT

EXT STREETS OF WEST VILLAGE - DAY

George walks alone on the not so crowded streets of the
West Village crossing South on 7th Avenue

EXT STREETS OF WEST VILLAGE COURTYARD BLDG - DAY

George turns the corner into a very quiet tree lined
street in the Village

He arrives at the old brick building and goes through
the gate

EXT COURTYARD BLDG - DAY

The sun reflects on the freshly watered garden which is
nicely landscaped and well taken care of The old
building surrounding this central courtyard is low only
5 stories high The place is quiet and has a sort of a
monastic feeling

As George crosses the yard towards the entrance to the
left he doesn’t notice a young man coming from the other
side

JOEY (0S)
Hey George

It is Joey carrying a shopping bag and a skateboard

( )

INT APT

GEORGE
Joey I didn’t see you

JOEY
I was waiting over there

GEORGE

Let’s go up I want you to see the
new place

IN THE WEST VILLAGE - DAY

The same apartment seen before but now with George and
Ben’s furniture spread around their books and objects on
the shelves Ben’s painting on the wall and George’s
piano occupying center space in the room

Joey is by the window looking at the courtyard below

GEORGE (0S)
Here

George brings in two glasses of ice tea

JOEY
This place is so nice

GEORGE
I know thank you I got lucky

JOEY
And really close to the river too
The new park is awesome

GEORGE
It’s changed so much When I first
moved to New York that was a no
man’s land Look at it now

Joey drinks his ice tea as George goes to sit on the
piano seat with his own tea cup

They remain in silence for a few moments an awkward
intimacy between them

JOEY
George I’m sorry I didn’t go to
the service

GEORGE
The service

JOEY
Uncle Ben’s service

( )

GEORGE
Oh it’s okay Funerals can be
strange Especially for people
your age

JOEY
I wanted to remember Uncle Ben
like I remember him now I’ve
never even been to a funeral
before and I was afraid that if
Id gone to his that would always
be what I remembered when I
thought about him

GEORGE
That makes a lot of sense to me
Joey I hope you didn’t come all
the way here just because you felt
guilty about it

JOEY
No Actually I came because I
wanted to give you something

Joey goes into the shopping bag he brought and takes out
a painting It is The Skateboarder the painting that Ben
made of Vlad

George walks closer to the window where the light is
brighter and he can see better the unfinished painting
As if holding a piece of Ben in his hands his eyes tear

up

GEORGE
Wow that’s very nice

JOEY
I picked it up at the top of the
stairs the day Uncle Ben had the
accident on the roof It was funny
because everything fell down to
the bottom of the stairs
including Uncle Ben as you know
but the canvas was neatly placed
on top as if he had had the time
to save it before coming down

GEORGE
You know that’s very possible His
paintings meant everything to him
I think that when he realized he
couldnt use his arm after the
operation he gave up The heart
was just a consequence Is that
the view from your roof

( )

JOEY
Yes it’s South

GEORGE
Is that you here

JOEY
No

GEORGE

I didn’t think so

JOEY
That’s my friend Vlad He’s a
friend who used to come over a lot
when Uncle Ben was living with us

GEORGE
You sure you don’t want to keep
this It’d be a nice memento

JOEY
No it’s his last painting it’s
unfinished You can look at it and
always imagine what he would’ve
done with the colors here

GEORGE
Nice Very nice Let me get a
hammer so you can help me hang it
on the wall

EXT COURTYARD BLDG - DAY

JOEYS GIRLFRIEND sits on a bench in the middle of the
courtyard with a skateboard by her side playing with
her smart phone She sees someone approaching and gets
up Joey comes to greet her He holds her hand and they
start to walk away each holding their own skateboard

INT APT IN THE WEST VILLAGE - DAY

George watches the young lovers from the window

After a moment he turns around and sees himself alone in
the apartment He walks to the Skateboarder painting
looks at it and tilts it a tiny bit making sure it’s
squared on the wall

EXT MORTON STREET - DAY

The quiet street is covered by an arc of trees

( )

Joeys girlfriend drops her skateboard on the asphalt
jumps on board and rolls towards the river Joey comes
surfing by and catches up to her They roll side by
side towards the setting sun
