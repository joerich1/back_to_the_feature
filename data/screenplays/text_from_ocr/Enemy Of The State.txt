EXT SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK SCENIC VIEW LOT - MORNING

Shenandoah mountains A cold dawn TWO BLACK TOWN CARS
sit side by side facing a view of a farming valley below

Two MEN in dark suits and long coats stand near the

underneath the coat of the taller of the two wed see
that he was carrying a 9mm Glock

INT BLACK TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

In the backseat of the car sit HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS

and how thou canst not bear them

them who say they are apostles and
hast found them to be liars

HAMERSLEY
What the hell does it mean

REYNOLDS
It means whos side are you on

HAMERSLEY
You didnt ask me to meet you 30
miles from my office for a Bible
study class

REYNOLDS
Its a bi-partisan issue Everyone
needs to swallow hard No one
including you wants to be fingered
as the one obstructing efforts to
crack down on terrorism and--

HAMERSLEY

REYNOLDS

HAMERSLEY

REYNOLDS

REYNOLDS

sky buildings blowing up American
buildings Americans getting bombs
in the mail What are we gonna do

HAMERSLEY

band of lunatics the keys to the
kingdom Im not gonna sit in
Congress and write a law that
allows the NSA to point a camera
and a microphone at anything they
damn well feel like And the next
time you have something to say to

in the rear-view mirror a BROWN SEDAN gains fast
Whoever the guy is hes flying Then a man with a

HAMERSLEY flies into a blind curve Tires SCREECH as he
rounds the bend to see

A PROPANE TRUCK Blocking both lanes of the road
HAMERSLEYs eyes widen He stomps the brakes SKIDS and
SLAMS into the truck The EXPLOSION engulfs everything
HAMERSLEY and the car are consumed The pursuing sedan

slows to a stop The men watch The cars an inferno

The MEN pull a U and drive away

when he was two and he was buried
in a Kansas field
(prying away DEANs heel)
My name doesnt matter

CLOSE ON DEANs HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a
miniature tracking device The MAN removes it then
returns the shoe

BRILL (CONTD)
A tracker Thousand yard range

The MAN reaches in a trash can removes a potato-chip

BRILL (CONTD)
Cmon

BRILL goes through the window DEAN eyes the window
not sure He eyes the door Same feeling

EXT LOADING DECK - MOMENT LATER

DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock
BRILL motions him to follow as he moves off into the
shadows

The sounds of the window OPENING behind them followed
by FOOTSTEPS BRILL shoves Dean behind a dumpster and
removes his gun as two men run by The STEPS FADE
BRILL looks Theyre gone

EXT FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT
Establishing A closed farmers market by the terminal
Several cars are parked Ones a cab BRILL opens the

drivers door DEAN grabs the front passenger door

BRILL
No In back like youre a customer

INT CAB - NIGHT

BRILL sits in the drivers seat eyes flickering to
all views as DEAN climbs in the back BRILL flips on
the meter and guns into traffic

BRILL
What happened

DEAN
It started with the information you
gave me on DePinto After we talked
he agreed to resign Next a phony
detective asked me about Daniel
Zavitz Then an investigator
questioned me about an extortion
scheme they claimed Zavitz was
behind The FBI started looking
into mob connections A doctored
picture in the paper Overnight
Im ruined Wife job bank
accounts everything gone

BRILL eyes the mirror A BLACK CHEVY appears several
car lengths behind

BRILL
DePintos dead

DEAN
Oh Jesus

BRILL
They found him yesterday folded
neatly in a car trunk What about
Zavitz

BRILL starts to weave in and out of traffic He looks
in the mirror - the Chevys also weaving several cars
behind

DEAN
I dont know anything about Zavitz

BRILL
You said he was behind an extortion
scheme

DEAN

They said he was behind an
extortion scheme

BRILL whips the cab around a corner accelerating

BRILL
And you were the last one to talk
to him

DEAN
Yes

BRILL

Whatd he say to you

DEAN
Nothing

BRILL
Whatd he give to you

DEAN
Nothing

BRILL
Dont bullshit me I can save your
life

DEAN

Im telling you I--

The ride from hell gets worse as BRILL screeches
another turn The car ahead stops and BRILL screeches
past on two wheels

DEAN (CONTD)
I just gave him my card
BRILL
He didnt give you an address He
didnt give you a phone number

DEAN
Nothing Two nights later I was
robbed Im pretty sure they were pros

BRILL takes an impossible left into another alley
The Chevy follows BRILLs good The guy in the
Chevys better

DEAN (CONTD)
Umwhos that

BRILL
Dont know Did you check everywhere
Maybe it was hidden in something
Maybe there was someone else--

DEAN
Someone else

BRILL
Maybe you bumped into someone who
took it and you didnt even know

The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy Their necks
snap back from the force

BRILL (CONTD)
Shit

WHAM Theyre hit again BRILL pulls out a communicator

BRILL (CONTD)
209 to anyone I need some help here

DEAN
Who are you calling

WHACK BRILL back-hands DEAN with his fist knocking
him silly as WHAM--the cabs rear-ended again

BRILL
(trying again)
This is 209 Does anyone copy

Then BRILL sees that the alley empties into a busy
street then a bakery shop

He slams the brakes Tires screech smoke but its no
use The powerful Chevy pushes the cab bumper to
bumper toward the street BRILL grips the wheel
Its all he can do as the cab rockets into cross
traffic and--
BLAM Theyre broad-sided by a delivery truck The cab
is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-
hydrant finally stopping under jetting water from the
broken main

DEAN slowly opens his eyes Water pours in everywhere
BRILL is sticking halfway through a window not
moving Seeing BRILLs pistol DEAN grabs it and
crawls from the wreckage

EXT STREET - NIGHT

DEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach

WOMAN
Look out Hes got a gun

They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks
around Off to the side he sees the Chevy waiting like

a coiled snake

DEAN limps into the crowd He rounds the corner to
ANOTHER STREET and now hes running with all hes got left

Using the extinguisher DEAN smashes the glass door to
an office and goes inside JONES starts to enter when a
shot rips into the wall convincing him otherwise He
retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS
DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked
door after locked door Finally one opens and he
rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself

No lock

He sees the MEN and they see him He slides a desk
against the door then backs away pistol ready

JONES (OS)
(disturbingly calm)

Open the door Mr Dean Theres

Seeing a phone DEAN grabs it

No tone Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatras song

greasy ground as the train screeches over him

Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric
Then its over The trains gone DEANs alive

just under the beam The windshield frame takes the
full impact The beam slices through steel and glass
decapitating the car They emerge on the other side
