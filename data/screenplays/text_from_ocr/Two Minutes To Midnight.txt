OVER DARKNESS - - ROLL SHORT CREDITS

BOBBY (VO)
Whats the measure of a man
CUT IN
INT BATHROOM - - APARTMENT - - START ON A MIRROR

And the MAN reflected in it Shirt off Exposed

BOBBY (VO)
-The sum of his parts

INT BEDROOM - - APARTMENT - - START ON A BUREAU

And the items atop it A WATCH A WALLET A BLACKBERRY

BOBBY (VO)
His job His bank account His
car

PAN UP to the MAN now in a suit placing each item on his
person a warrior girding for battle MATCH FADE TO

FACES
Brows furrowed eyes fixed Staring collectively ahead

BOBBY (0S) (CONTD)
Or are we bound by something else
Something greater

WIDER Empaneled in chairs 12 men and women in all spanning
all ages ethnicities and incomes A JURY

BOBBY (0S) (CONTD)
By our relationships To God To
country To family

We SEE a CRUCIFIX around a jurors neck with the reference
to God an American flag PIN on a jurors lapel with the
reference to country a jurors PREGNANT BELLY with the
reference to family

FAVOR ROBERT SHIRALDI the man seen at the outset standing
beside the jury Handsome Confident In command

BOBBY (CONTD)
These are the things we have to think
about when deciding the fate of Steve
Robinson

He points to the defendants table a puff pastry of a man
seated beside his equally overfed attorney
BOBBY (CONTD)
Now youve heard Mr Robinson and
his well-paid counsel ask for your
forgiveness for the forgiveness of
his emotionally abused wife

He gestures to his client a silicone PRINCESS at another
table dressed demurely(on the advice no doubt of counsel)

BOBBY (CONTD)
And you know what I think you should
give it to him
He glides back to the table Turns to face the jury
BOBBY (CONTD)
But I think you oughta let him know
that everything - even forgiveness -
has a price
FADE TO BLACK
Linger in DARKNESS until we bleed up white letters

TWO MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT

The TITLE CARD splinters down the middle DOUBLE DOORS flung
open light blinding us berthing a mob of people

EXT COURTHOUSE - - DAY - - WIDER(NO AUDIO)
Reporters descend steps microphones thrust and parried

Through the faceless mob we see THE PRINCESS donning Jackie
O sunglasses and a synthetic smile

By her side leading the charge is BOBBY Trundling down
steps pigeons scattering we RESUMEPRE-LAP SOUND with

VOICE (VO)
(filtered)
An astonishing victory for the
former Mrs Steve Robinson today
Despite being married to her oil-
magnate husband for less than a
year

WIDEN to see were watching the LOCAL NEWS on a TV in

INT LIVING ROOM - - FAVOR THE TELEVISION - - WIDER

A wall of congratulatory CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES line a tabletop
as THE CAMERA DRIFTS through the elegant confines and into - -

THE STUDY - - CONTINUOUS

Where we find BOBBY at his desk typing emails
Devoid of armor and artifice clad in ratty sweats and a
HUNTER COLLEGE t-shirt he looks surprisingly vulnerable

ANOTHER TELEVISION runs Bobby grappling for the remote
NEWSCASTER (VO)
-Robinsons attorney expressed
outrage at the verdict
Bobby stops typing eyes on THE TELEVISION
NEWSCASTER (CONTD)
Theyre expected to appeal the
verdict
Bobby sniffles a laugh Of course CLICKS the TV OFF
EXT BALCONY - - APARTMENT - - NIGHT - - TOP SHOT
A panoramic view of Manhattan from 35 flights up as
BOBBY
Steps into frame(ANOTHER ANGLE) the wind ruffling his hair
all the courtroom bravado abandoning him He leans over the

rail Looks down into the urban abyss mesmerized by it

He snaps to attention with the SOUND of the front door opening
and closing(os)

BOBBY
Out here babe

LAURA(30s) a beauty in a business suit sees her husbands
subdued state from inside their apartment

LAURA
You won you know
BOBBY
If you tell me to be happy Im

He enters the apartment watching as Laura drops her HANDBAG
on the kitchen counter along with some fresh FLOWERS

LAURA
I just want you to enjoy the moment

BOBBY
The moment No time for the moment
Partner evaluations in the morning

LAURA

LAURA (CONTD)

BOBBY
The hard stuff Apple juice
Sparkling

She dumps the contents of her purse on the counter

LAURA

Wanna help

She moves towards their bedroom Bobbys gaze going to the
emptied contents of his wifes purse

INT BEDROOM - - CONTINUOUS

Laura unbuttons her blouse as Bobby enters and remains in
the doorway dangling a SILVER CHARM BRACELET

LAURA
You going through my purse
(re the bracelet)
It broke a few weeks ago
(unbuttons her blouse)
I like to hold it
(takes bracelet back)
Reminds me of you

And she moves in for a passionate kissthat after a moment
falls flat Bobby not responding And theres a beat before
she steps back flustered Reflexively closing her blouse

BOBBY
Laura

LAURA
Its fine
(blurts out)
Are you not attracted to me anymore

BOBBY
What God no Have you seen you

She looks at him Swallows words Moves to the bathroom(os)

BOBBY (CONTD)
Laura

IN THE BATHROOM - - ON LAURA

As she slips into a nightshirt Calls back into the bedroom
LAURA
I mean what would you think Bobby

She returns to THE BEDROOM tying her hair back

LAURA (CONTD)
We used to go places do things
You used to write me notes in the
morning I just

Her voice trails off Bobby taking her hand in his Gently

BOBBY
Tell me

And shes about to speak when - THE PHONE RINGS At this
moment At this hour And they stare at each other until
Laura removes her hand from his and we

INT LIVING ROOM - - APARTMENT - - CONTINUOUS
Bobby picks up the phone on the fifth ring - -

BOBBY
(into phone)
Hello

We dont hear the voice on the other end we dont need to
We need only see the expression on Bobbys face

He hangs up UNPLUGS THE PHONE Turns to see Laura putting
the contents of her old purse into a new one

BOBBY (CONTD)
Ill have the number changed in the
morning

LAURA
This doesnt help

She picks up a New York Times Magazine from the glass table
gestures to the PICTURE of Bobby on the cover

BOBBY
Its business Laura
Itsbranding

LAURA
Branding - whatre you a cereal
Why do you need it

When he doesnt answer she proceeds into the kitchen filling
a vase with water as Bobby picks up the magazine
BOBBY
My first year of law school we had
mock court sessions a pretty big
deal right

Laura puts the flowers in a vase Looks up at Bobby

BOBBY (CONTD)

So I give my presentation doing
what I thinks a pretty good job
One of the judges - hes an appellate
court chief now - he says - in front
of everybody my whole class - that
he finds my argument persuasive
but content void They called me
void for three years None of
them expected me to be working for a
major firm or on the cover of a
magazine or a partner in anything

A beat

LAURA
What does this mean to you

INSERT - Her WEDDING RING Surprisingly modest Cheap
even Before Bobby can answer the rhetorical question - -

LAURA (CONTD)
Its the same ring you gave me when
you had three dollars to your name
Those things dont matter to me
Bobby Youre not your father
Youre not gonna end up like him

He stares back watching as Laura goes into the next room
Left behind he tosses the magazine in the garbage

INT BEDROOM - - TWO HOURS LATER

Laura sleeps Alone

INT LIVING ROOM - - APARTMENT - - LATE NIGHT

Bobby legs slung over a chair like a little boy sleeps
Legal transcripts splayed on his chest as we - - FADE TO
INT STUDY - - APARTMENT - - THE NEXT MORNING

In a dress shirt an empty Diet Coke can on his desk Bobby

writes on a legal pad CLOSER to see hes penning a note to

Laura Youre always there for me

Descending into clichés he crumples it up Tosses it

into the garbage beneath his desk(where we see several other

crumpled sheets) He notices the pen hes using
--CHEWED at the top

Flustered he chucks it into the garbage before seeing the
RED LIGHT flashing on his - -

BLACKBERRY - - An EMAIL from Seizethedaygmailcom
Bobby opens the email ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR BIG DAY

Back on Bobby perplexed He waits Stares Then Types
back WHO IS THIS Waits Gets no response

And he rises from the desk revealing that he dons only
boxers his suit on a hanger behind the door

He fumbles into his pants a negotiation nearly toppling
before righting himself and shrugging into his suit jacket

He looks back at the computer no response from the odd email

INT KITCHEN - - START ON THE MESSAGE BOARD

Magnetized to the fridge On it The Thought Of The Day
IM PROUD OF YOU EVEN IF YOURE NOT

REVERSE ON BOBBY A range of emotions he ERASES it
INT BEDROOM - - MOMENTS LATER

Bobby enters ready to bid his wife adieu only - shes not
there The bed unmade he begins to assemble it as

LAURA (0S)
What does it say about someone who
makes the bed before the maid comes

LAURA enters BRUSHING HER TEETH Bobby watches wearily

LAURA (CONTD)

She finishes brushing as he finishes making the bed

BOBBY
Eh You
LAURA
Sleeps overrated - isnt that

what you say

BOBBY
Only when Im sleeping
(re cell)
Can you fix this I cant get the

She takes his cell Easily activates the ring tone But
before she can hand the cell back we HEAR a CHIME

Laura returns the cell to Bobby Removes her cell from her
purse Her back to Bobby as she answers off caller ID

She slaps the cell OFF Returns it to her purse

BOBBY (CONTD)

part of the city

LAURA

She comes up behind him in the mirror Helps him fasten the
tie her arms looped under his her chin on his shoulder

LAURA (CONTD)

BOBBY
It embarrasses me thats why ‘Was

LAURA

So give it back
She moves into the next room(os)as Bobby loosens the tie

BOBBY
Wanna know what people hate

He follows her into THE LIVING ROOM grabbing his briefcase

BOBBY (CONTD)
More than communism racism
terrorism Rich people

Lauras in the kitchen now taking vitamins as Bobby slips
files into his battered briefcase

BOBBY (CONTD)
Soon as I start wearing slick suits
driving fast cars juries stop liking
me Which means they stop voting
for me Which means I can no longer
afford the slick suits and fast cars
I cant wear or drive

He punctuates this with a charming grin She returns it

LAURA
I like that suit

BOBBY
You should You picked it out

LAURA
-Maybe better without the sock

He looks down to see A SOCK stuck to the bottom of his pant
leg They share a laugh as we - - CUT TO

INT STARBUCKS - - MORNING(720 AM)
Bobby tells the BARISTA behind the counter
BOBBY

He steps to the bar head in his BlackBerry before noticing
the stunning BRUNETTE behind him in line when - -

- - His cell phone RINGS with the loudest most obnoxious
ring tone youve ever heard(Lauras joke)

Bobby fumbles for the cell finally sending the call to voice
mail Looking back up to see the brunette placing her
order(os) Glancing his way Issuing a shy smile

She sidles up beside him An awkward silence before - -

BARISTA (0S)
Venti vanilla latte

Before Bobby can dump two packets of Equal into his latte - -

BRUNETTE

BOBBY
Hmm Oh you know You have enough

But she retains his gaze And after a moment he tastes the
coffee BURNING his tongue Shit

Off her LAUGH we - - CUT TO

EXT STARBUCKS - - MADISON AVENUE - - MOMENTS LATER

Bobby holds the door open for the brunette And theres an
awkward moment when they realize theyre headed in the same
direction Wading through the crowd exchanging intermittent

glances and soft smiles when they both spot - -

A RASTAFARIAN MAN leaning against a building He holds a
SIGN reading NEED FOR ALCOHOL RESEARCH

Bobby hands him a few dollars Tells her

BOBBY
I like to reward honesty

BRUNETTE
(a murmur)
Odd in your line of work
BOBBY
(taken aback)

She smiles her gaze drifting down to his wedding ring A
pointed moment as he sees her looking at it Then

BRUNETTE
All of the good ones are taken

BOBBY
And a few of the bad ones

They stop at the corner traffic blurring by Awkward
tension Bobby looking straight ahead before

traffic Barely there a moment before - -

WHAAAAAAAAAAM A MUNICIPAL BUS
Plows into her over her through her - -
BOBBY

Opens his mouth to scream everything swallowed by the God-
awful sound produced when metal meets bone

THE BUS
Brakes twenty feet away belatedly realizing whats occurred

And everything speeds up and everything slows down and
everything stops SILENCE REIGNS

DOLLY IN ON BOBBY as SOUND RESUMES sirens howling people
shouting tires screeching - reaching a CRESCENDO before we - -

A different man in solitude he takes a moment Catches his

BOBBY (CONTD)

So that little bang-tail you got
waiting at home - believing in your
curriculum vitae - shes got you on
the clock Youre billing your rinky-
dink firm while shes billing you
And while your belly expands her
patience wanes Until her boredom
outweighs her indifference And
that inevitable day comes when she
flees when she outright bails That
day when you realize just how
vulnerable you really are Whena
second tier paralegal can make you
look like you club baby-seals for
sport Because she will raid the
vault And you will without proper
representation - and not for the
first time I might add - get fucked
in the ass

And then we see what these movers have done Theyve taken
everything Every piece of furniture every electronic

Before Bobby can react he hears a voice(os)in the next room
He rummages through a kitchen drawer emerging witha knife

And he stands there a moment Fight or flight Finally a

EXT BALCONY - - APARTMENT - - DAY

Bobby steps out onto the balcony in the same sullied suit

They took all my clothes
He settles in beside Nick the sprawling city before them

NICK

BOBBY
Talk about what

They trade eyes The elephant in the room Then
BOBBY (CONTD)
Its not gonna come to that

The thought of having to kill himself too daunting at the
moment he changes the subject

BOBBY (CONTD)

NICK
Now we know the worlds upside down

He ferrets through his wallet Finds three bucks

NICK (CONTD)

CLOSE ON ODOMETER A mere 39 miles on this baby

BOBBY Behind the wheel Looking odd and out of place

He adjusts the rear-view mirror studying himself and the
red-rimmed eyes that stare back

Its evident that hes never driven the car Equally evident
that hes unacquainted with the nuances of STICK-SHIFT

Bobby slams it into gear a WRENCHING SOUND produced as we - -

There are many lovely sights in and around New Yorks five

And while Bobby hails from humble origins only now does he
realize how far hes strayed from them

He locks the doors

MARTIN CASTILLO(50S)

An imperious presence when he laughsEVERYONE laughs
But at the moment everyones singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY

Bobby waits under the doorway eyes on Castillo - who kisses
his son And now we see Castillos son has DOWNS
SYNDROME a heartbreaking sight that makes Bobbys task all
the more difficult

BOBBY

Takes a breath Angles over eliciting just about every eye
in the joint But none more so than - -

A TRIO OF HEAVIES
Wiry men in boxy suits

Accelerates on sight of them Castillo turning to face
us(POV)as Bobby offers his hand and - -

BOBBY

Before Castillo can shake - -

BOBBY (CONTD)
--Your wifes attorney

Castillos hand stops

MARTIN CASTILLO
You would come here now To discuss
business

BOBBY
Not business sirnot to me

MARTIN CASTILLO
Im with my family

BOBBY
Well thats what I wanted to talk
to you about Family

POP A balloon explodes Bobby flinches
Castillo grins Looks at Bobby Tells his son

MARTIN CASTILLO
Go and open more presents Danny
si Go ahead its okay

The birthday boy recedes as a handful of heavies converge

MARTIN CASTILLO (CONTD)
Him being gone now you think thats
better or worse for you

SAME SCENE - - ONE MINUTE LATER

A corner booth Bobby sits across from Castillo the heavies
at another booth all eyes on Bobby

MARTIN CASTILLO

Family Familys everything You
can justify anything for them I
mean even my wife I love her I
love her for five minuteshate for
twenty

(a nod to his son)
But anyone ever threatened Daniel

He places a 45 pistol on the table

MARTIN CASTILLO (CONTD)
(re gun)
Amazing how that changes things
yes In my country hello and
goodbye are the same word
Similarly this is a symbol of
respect And a symbol of fear

Which for Bobby just might confirm his worst suspicions

BOBBY
I negotiate for a living Ill give
you what you want You just gotta
tell me what that is

Castillo applies balm to his lips in a sexual - and decidedly
unsettling - manner

MARTIN CASTILLO
In order for us to continue I need
to know what the fuck it is you are
talking about

BOBBY
Today Eight hours ago My wife
was kidnapped

MARTIN CASTILLO
And this is my problem how

BOBBY
Providing yourhistory

The reference triggers something in Castillo something dark
And Bobby cant help but flinch when Castillo reaches over
and grabs his crotch

MARTIN CASTILLO
The feds they like to place the
devices hereor here

His hands roam up Bobbys shirtlingering a bit longer
than your standard pat-down

-And now perhaps we understand that Castillo didnt in
fact cheat on his wife with other women

MARTIN CASTILLO (CONTD)
Accused of kidnapping But never
convicted Dyou know why - Its
a legal theory so maybe youll
understand Because in order to
convict one of kidnapping what do
you need A BODY

(a shrug)

None was ever found

He grins a confession that sends a shiver down Bobbys spine

MARTIN CASTILLO (CONTD)
My son he cant tie his own shoes
I tell you this not for pity but so
you understand My wife she takes
care of herself very well But
others - Not so well And yet
this woman - your client - youd
fight to get her custody of this boy
with so many needs So this whats
happening to you maybe its poetic
justice

Bobby tenses Cant take his eyes off that gun

MARTIN CASTILLO (CONTD)
I leave subtlety to the subtle If
I wanted to send you a message I
wouldnt use a pigeon Id use a
hammer And I wouldnt come after
your wife Id come after you

Upon sight of something OC he takes the gun off the table

MARTIN CASTILLO (CONTD)
Now youll excuse me

He goes to meet his approaching son Turns back to Bobby

MARTIN CASTILLO (CONTD)

Stumbles back managing to stay on his feet before - - another
flurry of punches tag him in the face head and neck

He tumbles downtries to get back upbut theres too
many of themand they hit too hardand he just wants it
all to end

Curled into a fetal ball he takes shelter from the blizzard
of blows as we

FADE TO BLACK
FADE BACK UP ON
BOBBY

Right where we left him Curled into that fetal ball on the
pavement Just now rousing from his beating-induced nap

Battered Not yet broken

Theres something digging into his stomach something on the
asphalt beneath him He looks to see

A 38 REVOLVER
On the ground A SINGLE BULLET beside it

Cautiously he takes the gun Then the bullet By the way
he holds it its clear hes never held a firearm before

Heavy in his hand he tucks it into his waist Slips the
bullet into his jacket pocket And he sweeps the scene
feeling eyes upon him Onlyno ones around

Dusk now(no way to tell how long hes been out) he squints
into the fleeting sunlight before checking his watch Only - -

Its broken Forever frozen at 456 pm

He collects himself Notices the torn jacket and pants of
his suit The dried blood on his knee and face

Frantic he fishes his cell phone out relieved to find it
untarnished and still functioning

And he looks to his left To his LAMBORGHINI Unscathed
Right where he left it

He limps over to it the streets deserted save an AFRICAN-
AMERICAN GIRL walking a pit-bull

BOBBY
Scuse me Dyou know what time it
is Hello

Finally the girl stops And looks at Bobby And looks at
his car And gives him the finger

Bobbys stunned watching her go before hobbling around the
side of his car to see the GRAFFITI SCRAWLED ON IT

NIGGER HATER

And Bobbys appalled And embarrassed He hustles after
the girl anything to apologize

BOBBY (CONTD)
Wait waitI didnt do
thatsomeone did thatplease
She stops Looks at Bobby her dog growling
BOBBY (CONTD)
You dont know me but I wouldnt do
thatI wouldnt
And hes so sincere almost childlike that she softens
LITTLE GIRL
Youre in the wrong neighborhood

Bobby doesnt disagree Has to know

BOBBY
Do you know what time it is

She looks at him Considers Reluctantly

YOUNG GIRL
Its six oh five

With this she resumes walking before - -

BOBBY
Hey One more thing

He digs into his jacket pocket emerging with a neatly-folded
SCRAP OF PAPER and 13 in cash

Finally his gaze goes to the busted but pricey Rolex
Submariner on his wrist

Bobby grips the wheel blinders on staring straight ahead

A predominantly black neighborhood people glare shout(os)

Bobby drives as fast as he can momentarily distracted by a
BILLBOARD for a local jeweler begging the question

WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO SHOW HER YOU LOVE HER
EXT GAS STATION - - EVENING (634 PM)

The Lamborghini sits outside the mechanics shop the freeway
and its prohibitive traffic a stones throw away

Bobbys made sure to park the car against a wall so that the
graffiti and the cars right side arent visible

INT MENS ROOM - - GAS STATION - - CONTINUOUS

Bobby splashes water on his face Beholding his reflection
as he dabs at his cut lip and busted beak

Feels his rib-cage Ouch
And its filthy in here the walls marred by graffiti

And Bobby studies himself lower lip atremble And for a
moment he seems on the cusp of crying

But hes distracted by the SONG piped-in over the radio

Time keeps on slipping slipping
slipping Into the future
Under different circumstances Bobby might even laugh

EXT MENS ROOM - - GAS STATION - - EVENING

Bobby limps out of the rest room looking up to see three
STREET PUNKS looking at the Lamborghini

He stops Sighs

By the time he lifts his headthe punks have taken notice
of him No doubt whos car this is One punk WHISTLES

PUNK 1
Nice car man

BOBBY
Thank you

Dont know that its so smart to
bring it around this neighborhood
though Lotta unsavory types around

Bobby avoids eye-contact Keeps moving towards the vehicle

PUNK 2
Something like this whats it cost

BOBBY
Too much

He forces a laugh trying to lighten the moment The punks
just stare malevolently at him Caress the wheels and spokes

Punk 1 thwarts Bobbys path Steps in front of the door

PUNK 1
Why doncha let us take it for a
ride bro Huh Come on well

(to his pals)
Right fellas

His boys chuckle affirmation

BOBBY
Guys Im in a real hurry here

Punk 2 the largest of the three drapes an arm around Bobby
Pulls him close

PUNK 2
Hang out playa Well do lunch

The punks laugh Inch closer to Bobby trouble brewing
Bobby gently unwraps punk 2s hand from his shoulder - the
punk grabs Bobbys arm twists it around shoves him against
the car a hand on his neck choking him

And Bobby cant breathe sweating panicking gasping before
he remembers the 38 on his person plugging it under punk
2s chin(notice how Bobbys hand trembles as he holds it)
Eyes wide Punk 2 relinquishes his gripsteps back

All the punks raise their hands in symbolic surrender

Not sure what else to say the gun odd in his grip

BOBBY
Get backget back

Waving the 38 around he struggles to open the car door
with his left hand

BOBBY (CONTD)
STAY THE FUCK BACK

He folds awkwardly into the car keeping the quivering gun
on the punks as he triggers the ignition

aged five years in the last five hours

Finally he notices an address Veers towards the sidewalk

story edifice at the end of the block

Trundling up the steps Bobby surveys the scene buttoning
his suit jacket before KNOCKING on the front door

Spurring ferocious BARKING from inside(os)

Bobby catches sight of his haggard bruised reflection off
the window doing his best to reassemble when the door opens

A MAN(white 40s)with a near rabid BOXER on the other side
a screen-door separating him from Bobby

Seeing Bobbys disheveled state the man stands poised to
close the door at a moments notice

This said because he closes the front door in Bobbys face
Seconds later we hear the bolt CLACK

And Bobby waits wondering if the mans calling the cops -
spinning when a car SCREECHES past behind him

Only kids joy-riding in a truck

Bobbys about to flee when - the bolt UNLOCKS The door

Several older women turn and look at him disapprovingly

Bobby slaps the cell closed Scans the area eyes going to a
BLONDE WOMAN in the LINGERIE SECTION - her back to us

Squatting down behind the lingerie counter she rifles through
several drawers oblivious as

-Bobby sidles up Waits
And the blonde rises And turns around

And we need no official introduction one look at her and
the reaction Bobby elicits and we know this is

JULIE HOLT Startled to see Bobby before she finally finds her voice
JULIE HOLT

(wry)
Well youre looking well

Bobby sniffles Self-consciously straightens his tie

BOBBY
I need to talk to you

JULIE HOLT
Im busy

She turns her back on him folding a silk negligee Her
slightly tremulous hands betray her cool veneer

BOBBY
Julie Please

She inadvertently crumples the negligee until finally

JULIE HOLT
Looking for something for your wife
today sir

BOBBY
Is this what you wanted To see me
like this

Finally she stops folding the negligee Turns to face him

JULIE HOLT
I never did anything but love you
Bobby I didnt deserve what you
did to me

And now we see the pain in her eyes a longing still there

BOBBY
Im sorry For what I did For
what I didnt do

JULIE HOLT
I left my husband for you Do you
understand that I left my life
But to you it was just a fun little
fling I guess

She dabs at her stubborn tears recomposing as best she can

when THE SECURITY GUARD glances over at her

BOBBY
We can work this out Julie

JULIE HOLT
I dont think we can

BOBBY
Listen to me Please Whatever
happened with us its got nothing
to do with Laura - -

JULIE HOLT
Its got everything to do with her
And everybody else youve hurt You
cant treat people like that the
universe wont allow it

When Julie tries to move away - Bobby instinctively grabs
her wrist Holds her in place Doesnt let go

BOBBY
Enough You made your point Tell
me where my wife is

And theres a moment of clarity as Bobby inspects her amber
eyes And sees her genuine befuddlement Then

MANS VOICE (0S)
Sir is there a problem

THE SECURITY GUARD Thick Primed for action

BOBBY
Were fine thanks

But the look on Julies face is pure damsel in distress

SECURITY GUARD
You alright Julie

She says nothing Which says everything

BOBBY
Were just having a conversation
here

SECURITY GUARD
Well you shouldnt talk so much
with your hands

Bobby realizes hes holding her wrist relinquishing his
grip as ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD approaches

SECURITY GUARD (CONTD)
Dyou know this guy Julie

And Julie looks at Bobby remembering all hes put her
through when she says

JULIE HOLT
No I dont

Bobby steps reflexively closer - the guards overreacting
reaching out grabbing hold of his elbows

He doesnt resist Just stands there looking at her
BOBBY
(to guards)
Its okayits okay

But he stays locked on her seeing the genuine pain hes
caused her Realizing that shes not responsible for this

Finally an anguished look on his face he softly says
BOBBY (CONTD)
I never mean to hurt you Im sorry

that I did

He keeps his unblinking and sincere gaze on her before
stepping back the guards unhanding him

With one last sorrowful glancehe walks away

dazed from his encounter with Julie and all the emotions it

resurrects in him

He crosses the street oblivious to the world around him

scurrying across the street

He looks down the block his Lamborghini GONE

BOBBY
(into cell)
Where are you

NICK (VO)
Look across the street

Sure enough NICK waves from his Honda across the street
INT HONDA - - STATIONARY

Bobby sits next to Nick as outside police cars ricochet past
on their way to Barneys

NICK
(re his Honda)
I know its not up to your usual
standards but
(seeing him up close)
Jesus Who did that to you

BOBBY
Hard to remember whose fist goes
with which bruise
(then)
You check on Brian

NICK
Hes out of intensive care doing
better

BOBBY

Good Let him know Im sorry I cant
be there for him

NICK
You see Julie

BOBBY
Its not her Her pain outweighs
her anger
(off Nick)
I know this girl Nick Its not
her

And that sits there a moment Bobby pensive before
BOBBY (CONTD)

Howd you find out about Castillo
and the kidnapping case

NICK
What One of the investigators I
use passed it on to me

BOBBY
When was it sent to him

NICK
Today Someone sent it
inanonymously

And slowly the realization sinks in that the information was
planted to manipulate them Then

BOBBY
You wanna know the saddest thing
Ive never loved Laura more than
today Right this moment

NICK
Well you be sure and tell her that
when you see her alright

Bobby removes the OBITUARY from his jacket

BOBBY
He left this for me

And we see Bobby holds his fathers obituary Lloyd
Shiraldi From the New York Times 1981

And he looks outside the window a wayward gaze

BOBBY (CONTD)
I remember walking home from school
seeing the ambulance practically on
our front lawn sirens flashingnot
making a sound All I kept thinking
was how upset dad was gonna be when
he got home when he saw what they
did to his yard Then I see my mom
on the porch this look on her face
Like I dunno a statue Never seen
a look like that before

(the point)

Whoevers doing thistheyve done
their research Maybe they think
‘cus my father blew his head offI
can too

NICK
Its not gonna come to that

Nick wheels the car to a curb Turns to his friend

NICK (CONTD)

Something else you should know
Peter The guy who worked with Laura
He called in sick today Today of
all days What if - and dont hate
me for this - what if Lauras with
him

(off Bobby)
Your insurance policy goes to Laura
Bobby And Ive seen the number -
its substantial

BOBBY
Wait youre saying Lauras behind
this

NICK

I dont like it anymore than you do
brother But you guys were having
problems

But Nicks theory hangs there for an eternity Then

BOBBY
No No She wouldnt do that
(wait)
For all we know this guys in bed
with a runny nose
(off Nick)
What

NICK
I pulled his credit card records
He used his American Express Card
this morning At Bergdorfs
(the kicker)
He bought jewelry Bobby

INT ELEVATOR - - TRUMP TOWER - - ASCENDING

Nick and Bobby stand at-attention Ram-rod straight And
theres tense silence as Bobby looks at the time on the
elevator TV monitor Its 919 pm

The elevator stops an elderly lady embarking even though - -

NICK
Were going up maam

As soon as the doors close the old woman grumbles clearly
wanting to go down

They ride up in daunting silence

PING Bobby exits ahead of Nick with

BOBBY
If Lauras in there I swear to God
Nicky Im gonna fucking kill this
guy

And Nick looks at the alarmed elderly woman An uneasy smile

NICK
You have a good night now

He hustles out into the
INT HALLWAY - - TWENTY-SECOND FLOOR - - CONTINUOUS

-Right on the heels of Bobby - whose hand rests discreetly
on the 38 handle protruding from his belt

NICK
Bobby lets be smart here

Bobby stops beside the door at the end of the hall lids
narrow eyes incendiary

BOBBY
Listen

FAINT SOUNDS filter from inside the apartment(OS)sounds
of SEX Moansgaspsgroans

NICK
Lets just take it easy okay

As if in response Bobby POUNDS on the door Hard

BOBBY
You should get outta here Nick
Youve done enough more than I
deserve

But Nick stays right there not about to abandon his friend
And Bobby nods in quiet appreciation before the door opens
to reveal - -

PETER(40s)

A dashing Brit with a chiseled torso he dons only a pair of
hastily chosen sweats and oddly enough a SKULL CAP This
guy you hate from the start

PETER
What in the fuck is it

BOBBY
Im Lauras husband

Peters charm kicks reflexively in

PETER
Laura Shiraldi Yes yes weve met
at some function or other havent
we Robert No No no - Richard
How are you

Peter offers his hand And Bobby stares at it And after
an awkward beat Peter clears his throat and

PETER (CONTD)
Is everything alright They tell me
Laura didnt come into work today

NICK
Who told you that

PETER
And who might you be

Bobby peeks inside the apartment looking past Peters arm
on the doorframe Able to see(POV) - -

Gift wrapping paper strewn about an empty wine bottle and
two wine glasses

Peter positions himself to further obstruct Bobbys view
And they trade eyes a standoff before - -

BOBBY
Wed like to come in

Peter looks at Nick Looks back at Bobby

PETER
Its not the best time gentlemen

BOBBY
Wasnt really a question

Bobby waits two seconds before pile-driving Peter into the
INT APARTMENT - - CONTINUOUS
--Slamming him into a wall Driving him deeper

PETER
Are you out of your fucking mind

NICK
Jesus Christ Bobby

Nick tries to intervene but Bobbys grip on Peter is non-
negotiable Seething

BOBBY
Where is she

And Peter might answer but its hard to talk with Bobbys
hand on his throat

BOBBY (CONTD)
Where the fuck is she

NICK
Bobby

Bobby catches his breath calming as he slowly relinquishes
his grip never relaxing his body Ready to strike

And Peter his sweat pants down around his ankles now reaches
to pull them up as

PETER
I dont know what youre talking
about I was trying to get some
sleep - -

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Peter

That voice From the next room The bedroom And Christ

An irate Bobby grabs Peter by the back of the neck leading
him towards the - -

A WOMAN In bed NAKED Not Laura
She grabs the comforter hurriedly covering herself up

PETER
Its alright Kellyits okay

With this he wheels on Bobby and barks

PETER (CONTD)
There better be a spectacular
explanation

THE LIVING ROOM - - MOMENTS LATER

ON THE CUT And Peters donned a Polo shirt standing across
from Bobby and Nick arms crossed Pissed

BOBBY
--You saw her last night you were
the last one to see her

PETER
--SO you come in here half-cocked
threatening me scaring the shit out

PETER (CONTD)

Bobby stares back Immune to threats

NICK
Did you and Laura leave together
last night

PETER
We did Shes a wonderful girl -
(points at Bobby)
- Something youre too stupid to
recognize

Bobby takes it Doesnt disagree

NICK
Okaylets stay focused here

BOBBY
She tells you things about us

PETER

Thats what friends do You may not
know this but you dont need to fuck

(gaining steam)
And you know what I did hit on Laura
Constantly But she wouldnt have
it wouldnt even entertain it
Because of you Because she always
told me how much she loved
yousomething that as of this moment
Im completely baffled by

Nick positions himself between Bobby and Peter expecting
Bobby to explode Bobby only stands there

NICK
Okay Pete Its Pete right Was

anything out of the ordinary
Peter looks to Bobby Looks back to Nick calming a bit

PETER
Nothing

But hes thinking and recollecting and

PETER (CONTD)
People walking Cars driving Some
city workers Nothing out of the
ordinary But you know what was
really odd

BOBBY
Whats that

PETER
Laura said she was worried about
you For your safety

He leads his uninvited guests to the door Nicks gaze fixed
on the obscure skull cap on Peters head

PETER (CONTD)
Its not a fashion statement I was
mugged last night Bastard stole my
wallet beat the shit out of me
Thats why I didnt go into work
today

Bobby and Nick trade eyes as we PRE-LAP

BOBBY (VO)

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - - SUTTON PLACE(1012 PM)

A deceptively calm night Nicks Honda idles across the street
from Bobbys residence

BOBBY (VO)
-Manipulating me from that first
phone call
INT HONDA - - STATIONARY

Bobby looks out the window Tough to tell if hes regarding
the outside world Or his reflection

BOBBY
And Im no closer to finding Laura
than I was twelve hours ago

NICK
Were gonna find her

Bobby sees Nicks black cell phone in the car ashtray its
the identical model left on his doorstep

BOBBY
I gotta think Im missing something

NICK

BOBBY

(a shaky smile)
Trust me okay I still have a couple

Bobby exits leaving Nick no choice but to watch him go
EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX - - NIGHT - - WIDE SHOT(UNKNOWN POV)

From outside the ambient glass a beleaguered Bobby ambles
through the lobby

STEVE THE DOORMAN (VO)
Mr Shiraldi

ON BOBBY - - INSIDE THE LOBBY - - CONTINUOUS
Heedless a dazed Bobby moves past before

STEVE THE DOORMAN (0S) (CONTD)
-A package came for you earlier

Bobby stops Enabling Steve to get a good look at him The
filthy suit The dried blood

STEVE THE DOORMAN (CONTD)
You alright sir

BOBBY
WHEN DID THE PACKAGE COME

STEVE THE DOORMAN
I just signed in ‘bout twenty minutes

BOBBY
Who dropped it off

STEVE THE DOORMAN

He peruses the logbook behind the desk making conversation
STEVE THE DOORMAN (CONTD)
Hows Mrs Shiraldi Havent seen
her for a while
Bobby doesnt answer Just stares back Waiting Finally
STEVE THE DOORMAN (CONTD)
Hmm Nobody signed for it
(off Bobby)
I can show you the logbook - -

BOBBY
I dont need to see the fucking
logbook

Steves taken aback surprised by Bobbys belligerence

STEVE THE DOORMAN
Yes sir

BOBBY
-eIm sorry Thank you

Bobby gathers himself Sees the way RESIDENTS regard him as
they pass through the lobby

But Bobbys beyond the point of caring No time for self-
awareness he asks the doorman

BOBBY (CONTD)
Whered you leave the package

CUT TO
A BROWN BOX

Right in front of Bobbys apartment door Moderate size
its unmarked A simple packing box

INT OUTSIDE BOBBYS APARTMENT - - HALLWAY - - WIDER

And Bobby stares at it tugging the sleeves of his jacket
down before squatting closer

Gently skittishly he nudges it like a kitten might a ball
of string Nothing happens Then

CLICK-CLACK

Bobby spins to see a NEIGHBOR exiting his door with his wife
and two kids in tow

And Bobby settles himself forced to endure the suspicious
glares of the neighbors as they move towards the elevator

He rises box under arm Unlocks the door
INT KITCHEN - - APARTMENT - - START ON BOBBY
Staring down at the box the 38 atop the kitchen counter
the apartment empty he grabs a PEN Looks down to see hes
chosen a CHEWED ONE yet another reminder of Laura

What was once annoying is now heartbreaking

And he takes a deep breath before cleaving the box open with
the chewed pen Looking in to see - -

RUFFLED NEWSPAPER

With BLOOD SPLATTER on it

And Bobby goes aghast(os)before we see whats - -

INSIDE THE BOX(BOBBY POV) A RING FINGER What we can only
assume isLauras finger A gruesome sight milky bone
poking through rotting flesh As if torn off

BACK ON BOBBY

Who suddenly violently VOMITS into the kitchen sink

Muttering to himself he hastily closes the box averting
his eyes washing his mouth out Spitting into the sink

And he stops And catches his breath Just as - -
HIS CELL PHONE RINGS

And its as if hes been zapped of energy instantly
enervated He answers without a word

And we HEAR only the FAINT BREATHING of the voice before

VOICE (VO)
Did you get it

Bobby doesnt answer Cant
VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
(excited)

Did you get it Robert

Bobby inadvertently looks at the message board Still
displaying Lauras last message to him I LOVE YOU

BOBBY
You sick fuck

VOICE (VO)
If you do what needs to be done I
wont need to send you any more of
her

Bobby catches sight of himself off the tables shiny surface
Looks like a Salvador Dali painting come to life Pleading

BOBBY
Lemme talk to my wife

VOICE (VO)
Yesterday a fourteen year-old boy
blew himself up outside a mosque in
Yemen He died for something he
believed in something he cant even
see And you you cant even bring
yourself to do it for the woman you
claim to love Do it Robert Do
whats right
CLICK The call disconnects Bobby slaps it closed

After a moment he takes note of the BLACK CELL left at his
apartment doorstep many hours ago Mind churning

CUT TO
THE CLANG OF A COFFEE CUP
As its placed on a table in ak
INT GREEK COFFEE SHOP - - WIDER (1041 PM)

A WAITRESS fills Nicks cup with coffee spilling a few drops
on the table top

WAITRESS (0S)
Sorry

Nicks distracted by the disheveled man who just walked in
BOBBY

Dazed he ambles through oblivious to the odd assortment of
PATRONS present at this hour

A student Two Hasidim A bum Some club goers
Everyone of whom look suspiciously at him
Chin tucked to his chest Bobby slides in across from Nick

Fidgeting with the silverware he doesnt say a word

NICK
How bout we get you some coffee
pal

He signals the waitress Tells her

NICK (CONTD)
Coffee for my friend Black Two
sugars

Bobby tics a glance to his left Behind the counter A
television(os) A picture of Ashlee Dunbar(the woman who
stepped in front of the bus)on it

And Bobbys on his feet hustling over shouting

BOBBY
Turn it up

Perturbed one of the cooks begrudgingly complies

CNN ANCHOR
(on tv)
Dunbar the husband of suicide
victim Ashlee Dunbar was found
alive and well today - the victim of
an as yet unexplained kidnapping

Bobby absorbs that information before staggering back to the
booth across from Nick A beat then

NICK
Whats it mean

BOBBY
That hell do itthat hell let
Laura go if I
(voice trails off
then)
You asked me before if I could do
it

NICK
Dont talk like that Bobby I need
you to stay in the game

Bobby slides THE BOX across the table BLOOD STAINS visible
on the scrap of newspaper protruding from it

Nick leans up to get a better look recoiling on sight of
the finger Emitting an inaudible yelp

Bobby takes the box back before the waitress returns with
his cup of coffee

And the old friends stare at each other waiting for the
waitress to exit When she does

NICK (CONTD)
Itsits Lauras

Bobby nods Nick looks like hes gonna be sick

BOBBY
I know how hes been doing it

NICK
Doing what

BOBBY
Playing God
(off Nick)
He knows where I am every second
Like hes watching me Tracking me

With this he removes the BLACK CELL left at his doorstep
Its broken into pieces now

BOBBY (CONTD)
Hes not tracking me anymore

Nick takes a quick hit off his inhaler about to speak when -
THE WAITRESS

Reinserts herself Wiping the coffee spill from the table
A decidedly intrusive presence Taking her sweet time
CHEWING gum wiping up every inch of the table(QUICK CUTS)

She reaches across to wipe THE MENUS off when - BOBBY SLAMS
HIS HAND ON THE TABLE

BOBBY (CONTD)
WILL YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

She recoils Nearly knocks his coffee off the table Looking
at Nick - whos embarrassed - before scurrying off

BOBBY (CONTD)
Sorryfuck

NICK
Its okay Bobby its okay

BOBBY
Im losing it manI am fucking
losing it

But he settles down a bit before glancing around the
place(POV) Then back to Nick

BOBBY (CONTD)
Is it me or is everyone looking at
me

Indeed Nick notices everyones glancing over at Bobby

BOBBY (CONTD)
You never liked that did you

NICK
What

BOBBY
Me getting all the attention Worst
of all you having to work for me
I mean we grew up together same
neighborhood same knocksbut me
I made it Thats gotta piss you
off

NICK
You got something to say Bobby

Nick starts to wheeze faintly

BOBBY
I never get calls when youre here
you know that

NICK
Im the only friend you got right
now Tread lightly Brothertread
lightly

Nick takes a quick hit off his INHALER Then

NICK (CONTD)
I got you information I got you
whatever you needed Think it
through

BOBBY
I am thinking Im thinking you got
me just enough information - and
misinformation - to keep me going

With that he clumsily removes the 38 from his belt placing
it on the table between them

BOBBY (CONTD)
And you gave me this didnt you

Nicks stunned Cant take his eyes off the gun
BOBBY (CONTD)
One bullet Poetic Ill give you
that

Nick finds his voice

NICK
--You think Id do that You think
I could do that to you to Laura
What the fucks the matter with you

BOBBY
Seems like youre getting pretty
worked up

NICK
Yeah gee must be guilty Who else
would get worked up by their best
friend accusing them of kidnapping
their wife

He stands chest heaving furious

NICK (CONTD)
You know what Bobby You still
havent learned the lesson of all
this Makes me think maybe you
deserve this

And Bobby watches Nick go a sense of regret already settling
in Somewhere between certitude and sorrow

BOBBY

Takes the 38 off the table Lets it rest on his lap as he
reaches in his pocket forTHE SINGLE BULLET

Hands trembling he cracks the 38 barrel open Slips the
bullet into it Slapping it closed just before - -

from his table when - -

Bobby reluctantly stops

WAITRESS (CONTD)
Your wallet you forgot your wallet

BOBBY
Keep it I dont need it anymore
He exits
EXT SECOND AVENUE - - 75TH STREET - - NIGHT

Still freezing out Bobbys immune to the cold Almost
oblivious to the fact that its begun to lightly SNOW

Hes mesmerized by the cars ricocheting past A never ending
parade of headlights

It takes us a moment to realize what hes contemplating

He rocks lightly back and forth summoning strength stepping
off the curb Feeling a yellow cab ZOOM by Inches away

And Christ hes gonna do it Hes gonna actually do it

60 yards ahead he finds his target A BUS Barreling closer
with inexorable momentum

This is his destiny

He closes his eyes stepping out further the bus bee-lining
for him Its HORN bellowing

WIDE SHOT Bobby stands there In its path

At the last second his eyes open and he steps reflexively
back - the bus barely missing him Close enough to kiss

And he looks around him At the other pedestrians No one
seems to notice No one seems to care Everyone consumed
by iPods cell-phones or BlackBerries

And somewhere somewhere close a CHURCH BELL goes off
signifying the hour

Its 1100 pm

The CHIME of his cell breaks his reverie resonating It
continues to bray taunting him

BOBBY
(low to himself)
Leave me alone

Finally on the sixth ring he answers it Says not a word
Only listens to - -

VOICE (VO)
I think its time Robert I think
its time to right all the wrongs in
your life

Bobby bows his head hand over his face fighting back tears
VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
Not many people are given the

opportunity to die a hero

And Bobbys about to speak before he HEARS something An
odd NOISE What sounds like electronicBARKING

(NOTE Consider a FLASH CUT here to Julie Holts old home
and the man with the boxer dog talking to Bobby)

The phone hastily and abruptly cuts out

In an instant Bobby realizes where the calls coming from
And the streets are vacant this time of night(even the
typically ubiquitous yellow cabs are nowhere to be found)as

Bobby glances around sizing up options

Finally nothing else to do he begins sprinting down the
street the snow falling peacefully around him

LONG SHOT A lone man running down a lonely street
EXT 34TH STREET - - NIGHT(1128 PM)

Calm Quiet Until we catch sight of

BOBBY

Running around the corner Rattled but resilient

And it must be close to the witching hour because despite
his evident exhaustion he outright sprints

And we recognize the neighborhood by the brownstones on the
block ITS JULIE HOLTS OLD HOME

Bobby squints into the void no lights discernible from the
outside Thick blinds over the windows

He fumbles with the 38 wiping his sweaty palms on his pants
Proceeding with caution

Glimpsing the formidable front door he shuffles towards a
side entrance a modest stairwell leading up to it

The screen door unlocked it CREAKS quietly open

Bobby slips the handgun into his belt holding the screen
door with one hand opening the main-door with the other

Finding itunlocked

INT HOUSE - - CONTINUOUS

Visibility near nil Bobby wrestles the 38 out quivering
in his grip as he wades deeper into darkness

Through the ramshackle kitchen we see pots and pans piled
in the sink the BUZZ of invisible insects

Drifting down a stark corridor the walls bare the place
barren Bobby continues toward a line of rooms

Ducking into the first to see

A pristine BEDROOM Immaculate Decidedly feminine Looks
like a Laura Ashley showroom

MOVING TO THE NEXT ROOM
Empty save a mattress and a pyramid of pizza boxes But the
walls are festooned with items Newspapers clippings

Magazine articles Photos

Each and every one regarding Bobby his career his education
his victories and defeats

BOBBY PAN POV BandW surveillance photos of Bobby with
JulieOf Bobby with Laura

And in the corner audio and video surveillance equipment
Bobby hears a sound behind him spinning to see
NOTHING

On edge the 38 RATTLES in his grip as we see his shadow
projected across a wall

And further down the hall WOMENS SHOES LAURAS shoes

And then deeper still we see LAURAS PURSE The strap
torn apart Signs of a struggle

Then ahead in the bathroom he sees something Something
horrible Moving towards it God no

ITS LAURA

In the bathroom In the shower to be precise Hanging
from a steel rod Partially tangled in the shower curtain

Finger missing her neck hangs unnaturally to the left
BROKEN Shes dead

Bobby drops the phone flopping to his knees Undone

BOBBY
No pleasepleaseplease

He wraps his arms around her flaccid body holding her close
A feeling beyond despair

He turns the body to face him to see the love of his life
only - its not Laura ITS JULIE HOLT In a brunette wig

And pinned to her chest a note REMEMBER WHERE YOU HAD
YOUR FIRST KISS

And Bobbys alternately relieved and horrified

He looks at his watch Its 1139 pm

EXT MADISON AVENUE - - MIDTOWN - - NIGHT(1155 PM)
ITS SNOWING

Bobby sprints down the quiet street angling for the building
where he used to work

Once there he finds the doors locked No wait The swivel
doors have been coerced open He slips in and into the

INT LOBBY - - OFFICE BUILDING - - CONTINUOUS

He runs to the elevator stabbing the up button over and
over again Come on come on come on Finally PING

INT 45TH FLOOR - - OFFICE BUILDING - - CONTINUOUS

The top floor Bobby spills from the elevator running towards
the stairwell marked ROOF ACCESS

INT STAIRWELL - - OFFICE BUILDING - - CONTINUOUS

He stumbles up the steps 45 embossed on the wall behind
him He grapples desperately to the top slamming a shoulder
into the door and out into the

EXT ROOFTOP - - OFFICE BUILDING - - NIGHT(1158 PM)

And now its really snowing Bobby running across the asphalt
head on a swivel No sign of Laura or anyone

He walks across the rooftop LIGHTS pulsing rhythmically
Stepping around several large satellite dishes to see

LAURA(POV)
Near the edge of the roof Sprawled on the pavement dried
blood cakes her legs and forearms Shivering from the cold

theres no need for restraints shes nearly catatonic

BOBBY
Laura - -

A knife Pressed to Bobbys throat A man weve seen before
behind it

MANS VOICE (0S)
Just in time

Bobby neednt look to know who it is

BOBBY
Youre Julies ex-husband

Indeed its the man we last saw at Julies former home He
speaks with a surprisingly soft and subdued voice It manages
to make him twice as scary

MAN
Alan My names Alan We may as
well be on a first name basis
(re the rooftop)
Does being here bring it all back
(whispers in his ear)
Are you aroused Robert

Bobby clenches his jaw Feels Holts hot breath on him

MAN (CONTD)
Give me the gun please

Bobby hands over the 38

ALAN HOLT
Glad you could join us

Bobby turns to face Holt

BOBBY
This was never about killing me was
it It was about breaking me

ALAN HOLT
It was about seeing how badly you
wanted to redeem yourself

Holt wipes at his runny nose

ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
I knew you couldnt do it Youre
not strong enough But forced
contrition is still contrition See
I used to listen to you and Julie
Her begging Begging you to leave
your wife Begging you to be with
her No wonder you didnt want
anything to do with her

(a sad laugh)

Almost made me like you

(MORE )

ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
Cept for the fact you were fucking
her of course

He wipes at tears Begging the question Whats worse than
aman with a gun A crying man with a gun

ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
You know what its like To have
the woman you love want somebody
else People like you you dont
know the damage you do The worlds
your china shop

BOBBY
Youve made your point

ALAN HOLT
Almost

And Bobbys left eye closes Due to the gun barrel plugged
into it A perfect fit

ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
I wanted you to know what its like
to lose everything in a day I wanted
you to know what its like to be
stripped to your core

BOBBY
I dont care about anything but my
wife

ALAN HOLT

Well were gonna put that to the
test arent we

Alan lowers the gun Keeps it trained on Bobby

BOBBY
I am sorry for what I - -

The CLICK of the cocked gun quiets Bobby

ALAN HOLT
(instant rage)
Im not the one youre gonna fucking

apologize to

With this he shoves Bobby towards Laura - who despite her
tattered state is overwhelmed with hope on sight of him

And its all too much for Bobby to take seeing the pain
that his actions have inflicted upon her

BOBBY
Im sorry babyI am so sorry

And oddly enough even though shes the one held captive

LAURA
Are you okay

Bobby stares back Void Vacant

LAURA (CONTD)
Why is this happening Bobby

And now that gun jabs the back of his head
ALAN HOLT (0S)
Tell her why its happening Robert
On your knees
Bobby hesitates Holt strikes
WHACK The gun SLAMS into him Sends him to his knees

Laura tries to stand her legs giving out Too weak Shes
been drugged Tears trickle down her face

And we sense theres no need for Holts coercive methods
the words spewing easily(and uneasily)from Bobbys lips

BOBBY
(like a little kid)
I messed upI messed up bad

Holt stands behind him like an executioner

Forty-six floors up the citys alive around us Its
impossibly and unexpectedlylonely

BOBBY (CONTD)
This is happening ‘cus of mecus
of something I did

And he forces himself to look into her eyes Its the most
intimate and unnerving moment in the entire film

BOBBY (CONTD)
Someone in my officea womanshe
and I we
(the hardest thing
hes ever said)
Were together

A dagger to Lauras heart Worse than any pain inflicted at
the hands of Alan Holt

BOBBY (CONTD)
II am so sorry

ALAN HOLT
The detailstell her the details

Bobby stares at his wife never taking his eyes off her
lower lip atremble eyes watery

BOBBY
We had an office party one nightup

hereand it happenedand I never
meant it to

ALAN HOLT

But it wasnt just that one time
was it Robert

Bobbys silent WHAP Holt pistol whips him Sends him
timbering forward LAURA SCREAMS

Bobby grapples back to his knees Resumes as best he can

BOBBY
It wasnt justone time
Afterwed meet in different
placeshotels
(a beat)
-Our apartment

And we see the impact these details have on Lauraand on
Holtbut no ones suffering more than Bobby

BOBBY (CONTD)
It wasnt you it was never you

Snow covers nearly the entirety of the rooftop

LAURA

BOBBY
It was a year ago

LAURA
How Long

BOBBY
Five months

Another dagger to her heart

BOBBY (CONTD)
Pleaseforgive meplease

ALAN HOLT
Even forgiveness has a price
counselor UP

He pulls him to his feet Bobby nearly slipping

ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
Do you wanna save her

BOBBY
Dont hurt her Please Kill
mekill me

Gun flexed Holt takes a step closer to Bobby producing
that sharp and serrated

BOWIE KNIFE

Bobby flinches rearing instinctively back before realizing
that Holts offering the knife to him

ALAN HOLT
You first

And Bobby looks at the knife quivering in his hands
And he looks at Laura horrified by this twisted game
ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
Do one last heroic thing in your
sad cowardly life Die so that
Laura can live
Bobby feels the heft of the blade in his hand
ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
A second of pain for a lifetime of

sin

Knife atremble Bobby lifts the blade higher feeling its
cold steel on his bare neck

THE BLADE
Presses closer to his skin against it Shattered beyond
repair tears bleed down his face There is a sense of

certainty and finality in his eyes

LAURA (0S)
Please no

BOBBYS EYES CLOSE
Squeezing tears out preparing himself

Draws blood piercing the skin a wince inducing sight even

All at once his body goes slack the knife CLATTERING to
the floor Crumbling back to his knees Its clear that

BOBBY
I cant do it

Bobby Racked with tears Coming completely undone

Disgusted Holt picks the knife up off the asphalt Brushes
snow off it Simple

ALAN HOLT
You made your choice she dies

With that resigned Holt stalks over to Laura Grabs her
by the hair Yanks her to her feet

And he smiles at her Oddly assuring when he says

ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
Our journey ends here

Bobbys incapacitated by emotion Sick with disappointment
and sorrow But he lifts his head to see

BOBBY POV Holt rears that knife back ready to plunge it
into Lauras belly and drop her off the roof

And Bobby on his knees ruined summons unseen strength
Instantly galvanized on sight of Laura in peril

And like an animal instinctive positively primal Bobby
runs at Holt A barbaric howl produced as he goes

A man possessed nothing concerns Bobby but protecting his
wife as he inserts himself between Holt and Lauraliterally
sacrificing himself for his wife

---Holt slashes out with the knife cutting Bobby across the
chest drawing blood

But Bobbys too galvanized to stop swatting the knife away
and grappling with Holt

They tumble to the icy cold asphalt Bobbys blood sullying
the once pristine snow

And Holts bigger and stronger but Bobbys a man unhinged
He fights like a beast Slamming knees and knuckles into
Holt - who rams a sharp elbow into Bobbys jawgiving him
time to

-Brandish that 38and fix it on Bobby

ALAN HOLT (CONTD)
Do you believe in justice now

Without hesitation Bobby runs fearlessly at Holt - who
squeezes off the only round in the gun -

BLAM Clips Bobby in the hip Doesnt slow him a bit
Bobby keeps going Until he reaches Holt A show of brute
strength - the kind reserved for mothers rescuing cubs
Bobby shoves Holt back Nearly picking him up
And tossing him off the edge of that building
We watch as Alan Holt drops

--Drops

--Drops

Like a snowflake
His body vanishing into the infinite abyss below
BOBBY
stands on the edge of the building the king of this mountain

Bleeding from his chest and hip hes oblivious to his wounds
Only one concern right now

LAURA

He staggers to herto his wiferemoving his
coatexhausted his legs give outhe tumbles to the
groundhis wounds instantly apparent

He reaches over Wraps her fragile form in his coat

She recoils scared of everything at the moment

And Bobby sits there beside her wanting to protect her
Wanting to have her purge him of his sins

And he extends a hand waiting for her to take it
To cleanse him
To forgive him
BOBBY
Youre the only one that can save

me

Only the SILENCE answers

Until we see something in Lauras right hand slowly unfurled
THE CHARM BRACELET BOBBY GAVE HER

She squeezes it never wanting to let go forgiveness in her
eyes as Bobby pulls her close

And here they sit holding each other snow peacefully falling
around them all of Manhattan surrounding them

CRANE SLOWLY BACK

Enabling us to see the city in all its enormity Distant
sirens sound Maybe heading here Maybe somewhere else

BOBBY (VO) (CONTD)
Whats the measure of a man The
sum of his parts

Bobby holds onto his wife her head resting on his chest as
we continue to RISE UP

BOBBY (VO) (CONTD)
Or is it something else Something
greater

RISE UP HIGHER until the island is but a mere blip the
endless lights numbing us as we slowly

FADE OUT
