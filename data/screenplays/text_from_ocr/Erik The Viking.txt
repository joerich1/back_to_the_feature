ERIK THE VIKING - Terry Jones ---------------

Blackness Flames begin to lick upwards from the bottom of the screen
Suddenly all hell breaks loose Screaming yelling Black figures
flash across the foreground with the flames still burning behind
There follows a confusion of burning raping killing and looting -
we dont clearly see whats going on Suddenly we cut to the interior
of a hut The door is in the process of being broken down The

camera pans onto the close-up face of an attractive girl who is
staring in horrified fascination at the door Her arms are white
with fresh dough and flour Suddenly the door bursts open and a wild-
looking Viking leaps into the hut He holds a sword He looks around
wildly and then his eyes come to rest on the girl This Viking Im
afraid is Erik We are about to see him in the worst possible light
so be prepared The girl whose name is Helga cowers and

looks terrified but resolute Erik glances round Then slowly he
advances on the girl forcing her back onto a chest Erik holds his
sword to Helgas throat with his right hand while his left hand
searches to find the thongs holding up his trousers He is clearly
having difficulties trying to hold his heavy sword to Helgas
throat at he same time as undoing his trousers He fumbles and lowers
his sword for a moment

HELGA

Have you done this sort of thing before

ERIK

Me Of course Ive been looting and pillaging up and down the coast

HELGA

(looking sceptical)
Looting and pillaging eh
ERIK

(on the defensive)

Yes

HELGA

What about the raping
ERIK

Shut up
HELGA

Its obvious you havent raped anyone in your life
ERIK

Sh

He covers her mouth with his free hand and looks round to make sure
no ones heard Then he carries on trying to undo his trousers but
he is now somewhat more than half-hearted about it Helga watches
suspiciously

HELGA

Do you LIKE women

Erik is clearly shocked and stung by the insinuation He stops

ERIK

Of course I like women I LOVE em

HELGA

(pointing out the obvious)

You dont love ME

ERIK
No right this is RAPE Mark you Im not saying I
couldnt get to like you in fact well to be quite

honest I prefer it when theres some sort of mutual feeling
between two people

HELGA

What - rape

ERIK

No It isnt rape then is it
HELGA

Oh get it over with

ERIK
(hesitates again)

I dont suppose no
HELGA

What

ERIK

I dont suppose you you DO like me at all

HELGA

What dyou expect You come in here burn my village kill my family
and try to rape me

This is too much for Erik We withers under the irony
ERIK

Ill kill you if you say anything about this to anyone
HELGA

(puzzled)

About raping me

ERIK

About NOT raping you

HELGA
You DONT like it do you

ERIK

Well it just seems a little bit crude thats all
HELGA

What about the killing and looting Thats just as crude isnt it

ERIK

Oh well - youve GOT to do them
HELGA

Why Why have you got to go round killing and looting

ER

To

K

pay for the next expedition of course

HELGA

But thats a circular argument If the only reason for going on an
expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the

ki

lling and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel

each other out

ER

Oh

K

Stop talking as if we were married

HELGA

We

ER

Ll you started it

K

I just said I didnt feel like raping you

HELGA

And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than

al

l the killing and looting that goes on Erik vents of his

frustration on the already shattered door

ER

K

Scream

HELGA

Ah

ER

K

Louder

HELGA

Aaagh Rape
ERIK

(hed forgotten about that)

Oh thanks

Two more Vikings burst in with eyes blazing They have the
very unfortunate names of Ernest and Jennifer but it doesnt really

matter for reasons which will become obvious very quickly They
are also slightly drunk

ERNEST

Rape

JENNIFER

Where

Jennifer the Viking sways and leans against a door post The
marauders eyes come to rest on Erik and Helga who are standing
fully clothed about six feet apart They look slightly puzzled
HELGA

He raped me standing up

There is a pause Erik looks up at Helga Why has she saved his face
by telling this lie Jennifer the Viking turns to Erik

JENNIFER

You finished then

ERIK

Oh yes I suppose so
ERNEST

Right Me first

JENNIFER

No I asked

Ernest leaps on top of Helga and pins her to the ground Jennifer
joins in Erik looks stunned for a moment Then he suddenly leaps to
Helgas defence
ERI
Leave her alone

He pulls Jennifer off but Jennifer fights back Erik forces
Jennifer back until he falls into the kneading trough They fight in
the dough for some moments until Erik runs Jennifer through

The dough is stained red and the film is rid of such an
inappropriately named Viking once and for all

Erik then turns his attention on Ernest who is still on top of
Helga Without a moments hesitation Erik runs him through the
back Ernest screams So does Helga Erik turns white and pulls out
his sword Ernest falls over into a heap with his co-misnomer and
Erik kneels beside Helga to find a bloodstain under her breast
where he has inadvertently run her through She is clearly not long
for this world

HELGA
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death
ERIK

I didnt mean to

HELGA

(gasping for breath)

Oh thats all right then its the thought that counts
Erik cradles her head and tries helplessly to staunch the blood
ERIK

You told them I raped you - why

HELGA

(dying)

I dunno you looked so so vulnerable

ERIK

Why should you care

HELGA
(dying)

Why should YOU care
ERIK

Tell me your name

Helga looks up at him but dies in his arms without ever saying
her name

ERIK

Tell me what IS it

Erik realizes she has gone He gazes at her for some time He
looks around at the two dead bodies beside them Then he listens
to the sound of raping and slaughter continuing on the outside
Screams and bloodthirsty shuts echo alongside the roar of flames and
the cries of animals The camera tracks into a big close-up on Erik

Superimpose the title ERIK THE VIKING
Second title TIM ROBBINS

Mix through to wide shot of the burning village Figures running
here and there Superimpose the rest of the opening titles By the
last of the opening titles the last of the flames are dying down

Cut to a close-up of a very loud-looking Viking screaming into
the camera as he hurls an axe This Vikings name is Thorfinn
Skull- Splitter The axe thuds into the wall a few inches away
from the face of a frightened girl Unn who is pinned to the wall
with her braids spread out The Vikings are hurling axes at her a
la Kirk Douglas in THE VIKINGS

Several Vikings sitting at ale-bench laugh in a rather unpleasant
way Erik however frowns He is sitting at a table on a dais next
to his grandfather the chief of the village His grandfather
almost chokes with merriment Eriks mother glances at him with some
hostility Meanwhile the drunken Thorfinn has just lifted the totally
legless Ivar the Boneless up off the floor and presses an axe
into his hand A tremor of nervousness ripples round the females in
the Mead Hall Ivar is clearly in no condition to throw anything
except perhaps the contents of his stomach Unn winces Finally
amidst much giggling Ivar throws wildly and the axe smashes into a
jug being carried by one of the serving girls The menfolk erupt into
drunken hysterics at this The women clearly feel that the occasion
is getting out of hand But before any of them can work up enough
courage to intervene Thorfinn Skull-Splitter has thrust an axe into
the hands of the even more plastered Sven the Berserk Now Sven
is not the Viking to let a little matter like not being able to
see straight stop him heaving the axe at a young maiden He takes the
axe and whirls it wildly over his head Even the other drunken
Vikings realize this could be dangerous and they cower behind the
table Sven lets go of the axe Unn shuts her eyes prepared for the
worst There is a dull thud and a grunt and then a whoop of mirth
Unn opens her eyes to find that the axe has come to rest in the back
of a totally stupefied Viking who merely slumps forward onto the table
he is sitting at On the opposite side sits Harald Missionary a
rather seedy cleric who has long since given up trying to convert
the pagans and found solace in their mead He thinks about
intervening but decides that its a bit late really and that he
might as well finish off his ale-cup instead GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE (his
only admirer) refills it for him At this moment however the axe-
throwers have run out of axes so as they go to retrieve the ones
theyve thrown Harald Missionary salves his conscience by lurching
across to the unfortunate Unn He pokes his dog-eared bible under her
nose

HARALD

If you were thinking of converting my dear this would be an IDEAL
opportunity

UNN

Not now

HARALD

(who is used to rebuffs)

No of course not

(he hesitates)

You might not get another chance you know
UNN

Go away

At this moment another axe thuds into the wall speeding up
Haralds desire to get back to the ale-bench

HARALD

Yes of course Ill pray for you anyway my dear
Suddenly an axe shatters a large earthware vessel

HARALD

Yes Thats what Ill do

Harald scuttles back to the ale-bench as fast as he can Erik
meanwhile stares in astonishment as for a fleeting moment he
sees Helga the girl he accidentally killed standing there with
her braids spread out in place of Unn He shakes his head and the
vision passes In the meantime however Ivars mum (perhaps the
toughest lady in the village) has decided that enough is enough
IVARS MUM

Let her go

THORFINN

Why

VIKINGS

Yes why

SVEN THE BERSERK

Why should we let er go

THORFINN

We havent hit a single braid yet

The Vikings all guffaw Ivars mum has had enough She throws the
contents of a jug of ale over Thorfinn He is shocked but after the
first shock he grins evilly because now hes been given carte
blanche to do the thing he enjoys doing most Without another
thought he throws a vicious right hook at Ivars mum and lays her
out cold Erik reacts with disgust His grandad however gives a

W

hoop of glee

GRANDAD

Whoah Heee That showed her
Meanwhile a little shrivelled old man is jumping up and down

INGEMUND THE OLD
Hey He hit my wife

Ingemund starts to go for Thorfinn but Thorhild beats him to it
She grabs one of the long-handled cooking griddles from the
fires and swings it at Thorfinn Thorfinn however ducks and the
red-hot griddle hits Sven the Berserk who is standing with his
back to Thorfinn Sven screams and goes berserk turning round and
hitting Thorfinn who is now standing upright again

NGEMUND THE OLD
Leave him alone

Ingemund hits Sven Thangbrand hits Ingemund and a general fight
breaks out Eriks grandad clearly considers this the highlights of
the evening but Erik looks at it in disgust and at his

grandad in despair Eventually he gets up and walk out of the Mead
Hall His grandad notices and frowns He knows somethings wrong
with his grandson but hasnt a clue what it could be Eriks mother
frowns and nods to his grandad Grandad gets up and fights his way
through the melee to follow Erik out of the Hall The snow lies thick
over the village as Eriks grandfather joins his grandson beside
the little quay Erik is staring broodily into the night

GRANDFATHER
Whats the matter son

Erik doesnt reply His grandfather glances back at the Mead
Hall whence the sound of the fight drift across the snow

GRANDFATHER

Were missing all the fun
ERIK

Whats it all about
GRANDFATHER

What

ERIK

We toil and labour we loot and pillage rape and kill and
yet

GRANDFATHER
You talking piffle son

ERIK

Where does it all get us Grandpa
GRANDFATHER

Who have you been talking to

ERIK

I met this girl

GRANDFATHER

Its always the women that start the trouble
ERIK

She got me thinking

GRANDFATHER

So Whatd you do to her

Erik stops in his tracks - as if brought up short by the horror of
what he has done

ERIK

I KILLED her

GRANDFATHER

Thats my boy

Eriks grandfather gives him a paternal hug Erik looks at him

and thinks about the generation gap Cut to feet running in the snow
t is day

ERI
Freya

Erik looks around him and calls out again

ERI
Freya

Erik runs into the distance - a small figure against the
dramatic wintry landscape

Cut to a remote barren mountainside Erik climbs up into shot and
continues climbing until he reaches a cave He enters it As his
eyes get used to the dark he can make out a few signs of life a
cooking pot on a fire a straw bed a pile of rune-sticks

ERIK

Freya Freya

There is a bundle of rags behind Erik A head rises from it This
is Freya

FREYA

Ah Erik Erik the Viking

It is not clear whether her words are not a little mocking
FREYA

Now what CAN you want with me Erik the Viking

ERIK

I shouldnt have come

FREYA

They will make fun of you for listening to an old womans
stories

Erik doesnt reply Freya watches him craftily

FREYA

Young men are only interested in fighting and killing

Erik looks up at her sharply It is as if she has read his mind
ERIK

But has it always been like that Freya From the beginning of time
Freya doesnt reply Instead she walks to the mouth of the cave
Erik follows her They look out at the grey desolate landscape
Nothing but arctic wastes snow and desolation Above them the
black clouds boil ceaselessly

FREYA

What do you see Erik

ERIK

see the world

FREYA

it night or day Erik

ERIK

t is day of course Freya

FREYA

s it summer or winter Erik

Erik looks round at the snowy wastes and ten back at Freya puzzled
ERIK

The winter is past thank goodness Freya It is summer
Freya puts her face close to Eriks and peers into his eyes
FREYA

Have you ever seen the sun Erik

ERIK

The sun is up beyond the clouds - where it always is

FREYA

But have you ever seen it Think back

ERIK

Of course not but when I was a child I remember a
dream it was as if the whole sky was blue
FREYA

The sky WAS blue Erik once
Erik looks at her

FREYA

The Old Stories tell of an age that would come such as this - when
Fenrir the Wolf would swallow the sun and a Great Winter would
settle upon the world It was to be an axe age a sword age a storm
age when brother would turn against brother and men would fight
each other until the world would finally be destroyed

Erik looks out across the bleak and gloomy landscape and the
black boiling clouds in the sky

ERIK

(almost to himself)

Then this is the Age of Ragnarok
Freya turns to go back into the cave
ERIK

Wait Freya

Erik re-enters the cave

ERIK

s there nothing men can do

FREYA

The Gods are asleep Erik

ERIK

will go and wake them up
Freya turns and looks at him She clearly enjoys his
earnest enthusiasm but is afraid he doesnt know what he is talking

about

ERIK
Tell me what I must do Freya

Freya thinks for some moments The she speaks

FREYA
Erik Far out in the midst of the Western Ocean there is a
land men call it Hy-Brasil There you will find a horn that is

called Resounding You must take the Horn Resounding and three
times you must blow it The first note will take you to Asgaard The
second will awaken the Gods and the third note will bring you
home But remember once you are in the spell of the Horn hatred
will destroy you

Erik turns to go and then hesitates

ER
And will the dead ever return Freya

FREYA

That I cannot tell you

Cut to a big close-up of a head being banged on the ground It
is Thorfinn Skull-Splitters The person doing the banging is an
enraged Sven the Berserk Suddenly Erik pushes his way through the

crowd and separates them There is general disgruntlement all round
and murmurs of Who does he think he is

ERIKS GRANDAD

What are you doing Erik Thorfinn just said SVENS GRANDFATHER
died of old age

INGEMUND THE OLD

They must fight to the death

THORFINN SKULL-SPLITTER

Thats right Sven must kill me

OTHERS

Yes Stay out of this Whats it to do with you

(etc)
Sven grids his teeth and struggles to get at Thorfinn but Erik
still keeps them apart

ERIK
Arent you afraid of death Thorfinn Skull-Splitter
Thorfinn shrugs

THORFINN

Not death by the sword It means I shall drink in Valhalla with the
great warriors

Cut away To Harald Missionary engaged in his usual business of
chatting up any available female

HARALD MISSIONARY
You dont still believe in all that Valhalla stuff do you
THORHILD THE FEMALE

Go away

HARALD

Fine right just checking
He moves off

ERIK

And you Sven arent you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to
Asgaard

SVEN

I will join my grandfather there
THORFINN

Hes not in Valhalla He died of old age
SVEN

You liar
They start trying to kill each other again and crash through a
fence into the pig-sty Pigs squeal and run in all directions

ERIK

Stop it

OTHERS

Leave them alone Keep out of it Erik
The others pull Erik away

GRANDAD

Theres only one way to settle it
EVERYONE

Yes

THORFINN

He MUST kill me

EVERYONE

Yes Thats right

(etc)

Sven struggles again to oblige and they both
duck pond Erik dives back to keep them apart

ERIK

There is another way
GRANDAD

Who gets killed
ERIK

Nobody gets killed
THORFINN

Oh well

topple into the
He starts attacking Sven again Erik decides there is only one way
to make his point He lets fly with his fists and lays’ both
the antagonists out for a moment

ERIK

But it will be dangerous Maybe none of us will return

SNORRI THE MISERABLE

Ah well thats much more sensible than just Thorfinn getting
killed Shall we all go and pack now

SVEN

What are you talking about Erik

ERIK

What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge

This causes a sensation amongst everyone watching on the lines of
You cant do that and so on They scoff at Erik

THORFINN
(in disbelief)

FIND the Rainbow Bridge

ERIK
Find it AND cross it
Super-sensation amongst everyone - except for Harald Missionary

who shakes his head sadly

HARALD

Look You cant find somewhere that doesnt exist
GRANDAD

(to Harald)

Shut up

Harald shrugs
SVEN

Only the dead reach Asgaard Erik

ERIK

Whats the matter Are you afraid to try
Thorfinn and Sven are put on the defensive
THORFINN

Of course were not afraid to try but
Erik rounds on Thorfinn sensing he had the advantage
ERIK

But what

THORFINN

But

ERIK

What

Thorfinns mental powers find it hard to articulate any proposition
on such a vast metaphysical concept Sven comes to his rescue

SVEN

Nobodys ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard
ERIK

Wed be the first

SNORRI

You mean wed be dead

ERIK

No Wed be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the
Gods

Pause Uncomfortable shifting
SVEN

But HOW

ERIK

I dont know - but Im not afraid to try
THORFINN

Well IM certainly not either

SVEN

Neither am I

ERIK

Then youll come

HARALD

But there isnt such a place as Look
THORFINN and SVEN

Shut up

ERIK

What dyou say

SVEN

Well Im game

THORFINN

Me too

Erik grins He has persuaded them against their will
GRANDAD

Arent you going to go on fighting

SVEN and THORFINN

No
OTHERS

Oh

There is general disappointment all around

IVAR THE BONELESS

Oh go on

GRANDAD

Just have a bit of a fight

INGEMUND THE OLD

ILL fight someone

GRANDAD

Youre too old

INGEMUND THE OLD

No I aint

Cut to an adze striking timber The Vikings ship GOLDEN DRAGON
is being repaired and fitted out for a JOURNEY Erik is there
directing operations The camera tracks through all the activity and
finally comes to rest on Keitel Blacksmith He is a magnificent
mountain of aman in an Arnold Schwarzeneggarish sort of way He
hammers a sword and sparks fly but his eyes keep returning to the
preparations for the voyage Clearly something is worrying him His
assistant Loki sidles up to him

LOKI

Wish you were going too

eitel grunts angrily and plunges the sword into cold water Steam
and bubbles

LOKI

But you CANT because youre too busy

eitel pulls the sword out of the water and tests it It slices like
as razor Loki watches
LOKI

Ooh thats a good one You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that
one

EITEL

Yes it is good But I told him ten
LOKI

You could charge him what you like

Loki takes the sword from Keitel and stacks it alongside a lot
more freshly made swords

LOKI
You just cant make enough swords and spears and knives and

daggers to satisfy the demand You could charge Halfdan twenty and
hed pay it

EITEL

(shocked)

Oh I couldnt do that The Blacksmiths Code says
LOKI

Yes yes of course the Blacksmiths Code

eitel goes back to his forge and pulls out a fresh dollop of white-
hot ore Loki comes up behind him

LOKI

f this IS the Age of Ragnarok Keitel Blacksmith it is GOOD to us

EITEL

(banging with his hammer)
Cant make enough swords
Bang Bang Bang

KEITEL
Cant make enough axe-heads

Bang Bang Bang

LOKI
But Keitel if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding if he ever
crosses Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge if he ever wakens the gods

eitel stops smiting the metal on his forge He stares into space
EITEL

They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky

LOK
he Age of Ragnarok ends

EITEL

The bottom falls out of the sword business

LOK

ts not just YOUR livelihood thats at stake but your sons and
the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths

KEITEL

(this touches a nerve in his muscular mind)
My brother blacksmiths

LOK
Thats right

EITEL

The Blacksmiths Code says I must
LOK

Honour and protect all blacksmiths

EITEL

(as if reciting his oath)
Together we stand

LOKI

You cant let Erik do THAT

Loki smiles He has Keitel playing into his hands although
eitel doesnt realize it Fade Cut to some days later The

expedition is set to leave Thorfinn Skull-Splitter taking leave of
his mum and dad

THORFINNS MUM

And youve got BOTH axes
THORFINN

Yes Mother

THORFINNS MUM
And something to sharpen them with
THORFINN

Yes Mum

THORFINNS MUM

THORFINN
(mildly)

Cut to Sven the Berserk who is also being lectured The lecture

is coming from his father - Ulf the Maddeningly Calm
SVENS FATHER

(sotto voce)

ts a tradition

SVEN

SVENS FATHER

SVEN
You went berserk

SVENS FATHER

I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald

SVEN

SVENS FATHER

SVEN

But its a responsibility
SVENS FATHER

But its a responsibility being a Berserk
SVEN

I must only let the red rage

SVENS FATHER

You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of
battle

SVEN
(losing his temper)
I KNOW IVE HEARD IT ALL I THOUSAND TIMES

A sudden silence falls as all the village turns to stare nervously
at Sven He goes berserk and demolishes a nearby hut with his head
Ulf the Maddeningly Calm shakes his head

SVENS FATHER

No no youll never make a Berserk If you let it out now youll
have nothing left for battle

IVARS MUM

Besides its dangerous

SVENS FATHER

(gloomily)

Its the end of a family tradition

In another corner of the village Leif the Lucky is standing with
his pregnant girlfriend

GIRL
Bye Leif
LEIF

Bye sorry
GIRL

Yeah well

LEIF

You will wait

GIRL

What dyou expect me to do

She takes a bracelet off her arm and gives it to Leif
GIRL

Leif looks at it

LEIF

GIRL

Cut to Harald Missionary dumping a bag on board the ship
GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE

is helping him Snorri looks at him in surprise
SNORRI

YOU coming You dont even believe in Asgaard
HARALD

I thought I might do a bit of business on the way
SNORRI

Youre wasting your time

HARALD

Listen Ive been in this dump for sixteen years and I havent made a
single convert
SNORRI

There was Thorbjorn Vifilssons wife You converted HER

HARALD

Thorbjorn Vifilssons wife became a Buddhist not a Christian

SNORRI

Same thing isnt it

HARALD

No it is NOT

Meanwhile in another part of the village Loki is strapping a
large consignment of swords onto a pony He glances round and then
sneaks surreptiously out of the village over the barren hills of
Norway under the boiling black skies of Ragnarok Back at the
quayside GOLDEN DRAGON is ready for the journey Erik addresses
the villagers

ERIK

Well well be off now

Eriks grandad waits for some time before he realizes that Erik
isnt intending to say anything else

GRANDAD

You need to say a bit more than that
ERIK

Oh er yes

The faces of the village-folk turn towards him There are many
moist eyes Eriks mother starts to cry

ERIK
Oh there Mum

(he turns and addresses everyone)
Dont be sad You all know why were going so dont grieve
Maybe untold dangers do lie ahead of us and some of you may well be
looking at the one you love for the last time

Someone bursts out sobbing Erik desperately tries to rally
their spirits

ERIK

But dont grieve Even tough the Hordes of Muspel tear us limb from
limb or the Fire Giants burn each and every one of us toa
cinder

More crying

ERIK

though we may be swallowed by the Dragon of the North Sea or fall
off the Edge of the World dont cry

More crying
ERIK
No Dont cry

By this time most of the village is blubbering profusely Cut to
Harald Missionary He has his arm round his weeping girlfriend

HARALD MISSIONARY

Sh There its all fantasy theres no Dragon of the North
Sea no Edge of the World

GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE

Thats what YOU say

ERIK

(aside to his Grandad)
Whats the matter with them
GRANDAD

Just say something cheerful

ERIK
Oh right

(He cant think of anything)

Well CHEERS everybody

Erik smiles broadly and waves The entire village stares back at
him with tears in their eyes and biting their lips Suddenly one
mother cant hold it back any more

THORFINNS MUM

Dont go

Another mother rushes out and grabs Ivar the Boneless

IVARS MUM

My son I dont want you to go

IVAR

I dont want to go either

ERIK

Oh gods Please everybody Keep calm Its not certain ALL of us are
going to die and in any case we may not die HIDEOUS deaths

More renewed sobbing Grandads eyes go heavenwards
GRANDAD

(to Erik)

I think we should go

ERIK

Right

(he turns for a last salute)

Farewell for the last time may the gods prevent
GRANDAD

No dont say anything else
Suddenly Keitel Blacksmith steps forward His muscles’ ripple
His handsome face radiates heroism and manliness

KEITEL

Wait Erik

ERIK

Keitel Blacksmith
They stop and turn
KEITEL

You cant go without me Who will repair your swords and mend your
shields

Renewed sobs from the women

WOMEN

Oh no Ah lackaday Not HIM too

ERIK

Whats the matter now

UNN

If Keitel Blacksmith goes with you

THORHILD

Well have no one to do the things he did for us
THORKATLA THE INDISCRETE

OR sharpen our knives and make our pans

An awkward silence The others all turn on her and frown - a bit

of shin-kicking goes on Its clear that Keitel is popular amongst
the womenfolk Erik doesnt notice

ERIK
You will have Keitels assistant Loki to do all that

WOMEN
Loki Eurrgh
ERIK

Whats wrong with Loki Hes become very good at blacksmithing

WOMEN
Yes but
THORKATLA

Hes so small and
The others all shush her up More shin-kicking
THORHILD

(innocently)

Oh yes weve got Loki Thats true

Cut to Loki leading his pony across a bleak landscape He
eventually stops and looks ahead There stands a gibbet with two
corpses dangling from it He is nearing his destination Cut back to
Erik and his men getting into GOLDEN DRAGON Erik notices Thorfinn and
Sven quarrelling over Leif the Lucky

ERIK

Hey you two Whats going on

SVEN

ERIK

Well what difference does it make where youre SITTING
SVEN

Sven nods towards Snorri the Miserable - an Eeyore of a Viking if
ever there were one

SNORRI

Thank you VERY much indeed
ERIK

Now stop it

SNORRI

Its SO nice to feel wanted
ERIK

Leif you sit there Even you sit there Harald youd better sit

ERIK

Shut up You there You there and you there
Ivar and Ornulf swap places Erik surveys this re-arrangement
ERIK

Thats better

SNORRI

Now youve got all the ones with beards on one side and all the
moustaches on the other

This is true Erik thinks some moments and then
ERIK
It doesnt matter

They start to haul the sail up Ropes are released The boat
rocks Suddenly a voice cuts through the crowd It is Eriks mother

ERIKS MUM
Wait Wait Wait

ERIK

What is it

(he is clearly a little embarrassed)
ERIKS MUM

Here son

She tries to hand Erik what looks unmistakably like a pillow Erik
is dumbfounded

ERIKS MUM
Your father always made sure he could rest his head at night

Erik is mortified The others snigger though not without some
sympathy for Erik Theyve ALL been embarrassed by their mums at
one time or another

ERI
I cant take THAT on a voyage

ERIKS MUM

It was your fathers

Erik will find it hard to refuse now But he hesitates
ERIKS MUM

It was the pillow HE took with him He said it once saved his life

Erik reluctantly takes the precious object His mother kisses him
Everyone has fallen silent now The relatives stand helpless on
the shore as GOLDEN DRAGON starts to drift away from them The
Vikings sit in their places hands on the oars looking back at their
loved ones Erik stands at the prow of GOLDEN DRAGON For a moment
he thinks he sees the girl he killed standing white in death
the spear-wound still fresh Erik raises his hand in a half-goodbye
We cut back to the loved ones now the girl is no longer there
They too half-raise their hands Erik suddenly turns and gives a
shout

ERIK
Huuup

The oars go up and then into the water and GOLDEN DRAGON commences
her voyage Cut back to GOLDEN DRAGON at sea Snorri is feeling queasy
and gazing gloomily at the receding coastline of Norway Thangbrand
is sitting near him and feeling equally queasy

SNORRI

Have a good look thats the last well see of old Norway

Snorri is desperately trying to control his insides

SNORRI

Goodbye home goodbye family goodbye loved ones

(he starts to throw up)

Goodbye lunch

THANGBRAND

Oh Shut up

Harald Missionary puts his arm around Snorri

HARALD

You know my son our lord said

SNORRI

YOUR lord

HARALD

Quite MY lord said The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick
SNORRI

I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord

Harald Missionary gives him a condescending smile and a weary shake
of the head He knows the Dragon of the North Sea does not exist

HARALD

Darkness and ignorance
Meanwhile Ivar the Boneless and Sven the Berserk are both
suffering from the effects of the sea

SVEN

keeping a wave of nausea down)
Its not so bad when youre rowing
THORFINN SKULL-SPLITTER

Thats right

Thorfinn gobs onto the whetstone with which he is sharpening his
axe Sven can control himself no longer He rushes for the side

SVEN THE BERSERK

I want to die

This sets off Ivar
IVAR THE BONELESS
Uh oh

He leaps up and pukes over the side Mass puking breaks out all
over the boat Keitel Blacksmith looks around at his preoccupied
shipmates and it slowly dawns upon him that this might be the
moment to try a little sabotage He goes to the ships lodestone
which is hanging from the mast Keitel glances around No one is
looking but this sort of covert behaviour goes against his normally
sunny and open disposition

KEITEL
(to himself)
The Blacksmiths Code

He steels himself takes down the lodestone snaps out the piece
of metal in the base and throws it over the side Keitel hangs it up
again on the mast

THORFINN

Are you all right

IVAR
No Im not

THORFINN

You dont need to feel bad about being sea-sick you know
VAR

How can you help feeling bad when youre sea-sick
THORFINN

mean many of the greatest sailors were

Pause

VAR

know I know

THORFINN

Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage the whole
time non-stop puke puke puke

VAR

Look I dont feel BAD about it I just feel ILL
Thorfinn pauses and waits for a wave of nausea to creep up on Ivar

THORFINN

He used to puke in his sleep

VAR

Bastard

He throws up Meanwhile Erik is in the stern gazing out behind them
ERIK

Thorfinn look over there

Thorfinn leaves Ivar and joins Erik On the horizon a sinister sail

is following them Thorfinn grins with evil pleasure He scents a
fight Erik turns to the crew
ERIK

Break out the oars

Thorfinns smile disappears and he spins round to confront Erik

THORFINN

What are you talking about

ERIK

(to his reluctant crew)

Come on move it

Most of the men are being sea-sick

MORD FIDDLE

Weve only just started cooking lunch

The crew glance at Mord Fiddle and then throw up again

ERIK

Move it

Reluctantly the crew take up their rowing positions
Thorfinn buttonholes Erik (except of course that he
have any buttonholes)

THORFINN

ts Halfdan the Black

ERIK

know Snorri Get your oar out

Snorri is sitting in position but without his oar Keitel has
meanwhile joined them He too stares at the horizon He is
puzzled by this turn of events Loki has said nothing about
coming after them

KEITEL

(uneasily)

doesnt

a little
Halfdan
Do you suppose he wants to stop us waking the Gods

Erik looks at Keitel with a certain amount of contempt Keitel is
not renowned even amongst these Vikings for his brain-power

ERIK

What do you think

KEITEL

But how could he know unless

Keitel stops in mid-sentence as he realizes it must be Lokis doing
THORFINN

(scornfully)

So are you going to run away from him Erik
Erik turns to Thorfinn

ERIK

Row Thorfinn Skull-Splitter

Thorfinn hesitates

ERIK

And you Keitel Blacksmith

KEITEL

But

Keitel shrugs and turns to take up his rowing position He is still
a little confused by this turn of events Erik confronts Thorfinn

ERIK
I gave an order Or didnt you hear

There is something about Eriks manner that carries an authority
that Thorfinn cannot argue with

ERIK
Come on Ivar

Erik manhandles Ivar over to his drum and thrusts his drumsticks
into his hands Halfdans ship is twice the size of Eriks and as
Erik is only too well aware consequently travels at twice the
speed There is no real chance of them escaping unless Erik
suddenly catches sight of a thick bank of mist in the distance and
steers his ship towards it

IVAR

(still feeling ill)

I want to die

(then suddenly catching sight of Halfdans ship behind him)

No I dont

ERIK

Row Row Row

Ivar tries to get into the new rhythm but has a bit of difficult
As Halfdans ship gains on them inexorably GOLDEN DRAGON glides into
the sea mist There is a tremendous roll of thunder very close
All the Vikings look scared Erik however grins

ERIK

Row Row Row

He doubles the speed The drum beats faster

SVENS DAD

(shouts out angrily)

We cant keep this up

Erik grins and then leans on the steering oar GOLDEN DRAGON
curves around to its left Then Erik lays his hand on Ivars drum and
silences it

ERIK

Oars up
The Vikings ship their oars and sit there in the mist listening
to beating of Halfdans drum getting closer and closer At the final
moment however Halfdan swings his ship in the opposite direction
from Eriks and the sound of his drum disappears into the mist
Eriks men breathe a sigh of relief even Keitel Blacksmith Fade
Fade up some time later GOLDEN DRAGON is still drifting in the mist
Erik has his fish-lodestone and is trying the direction but
the lodestone is just swinging round uselessly After trying a few
times Erik gives up and throws the lodestone away into the boat The
men peer into the thick mist they are lost Suddenly Erik sees
something ahead

ERI
The Gates of the World

MORD FIDDLE

What

GOLDEN DRAGON silently guides between two weird islands

ERI

We have passed through the Gates of the World

(he looks around at the other)

No we are in the Unknown

GOLDEN DRAGON drifts on and the mist gets thicker There is a crash
of thunder Then a series of flashes lights up the mist around them
The Vikings are uneasy sensing a storm brewing Suddenly Erik points

above them The others look up too They all gasp

ERIK

hardly daring to breathe)

So THAT is what the sun looks like

Above them hangs a luminous yellow globe its light just
breaking through the mist

VIKING
(to each other)

The sun Its the sun Look
SVENS DAD

(in wonderment)

I never though I should live to see the sun again

HARALD MISSIONARY

Where

The Vikings all gaze up above them in awe Harald looks from one to
the other and then tries to follow their eyelines He clearly cant
see it Magic music fills the air Suddenly the sun swoops off to
one side and starts swaying from one side to another

ERIK

Should the sun do that

HARALD MISSIONARY

What are you looking at

ERIK

Look out

VIKINGS

Ah

The Vikings scream and flatten themselves against the sides of
the boat as the sun suddenly lurches down on them out of the
sky revealing for the first time that it is NOT the sun at all
but a strange monster with a long neck that disappears off into the
mist and a glowing globe for a head and huge chomping jaws The
Vikings are understandably terrified

VIKINGS

Its not the sun Its not the sun

HARALD MISSIONARY

What is it

SNORRI

Its the Dragon of the North Sea
HARALD MISSIONARY
(knowingly)
Ah THATS why I cant see it

As the Dragon of the North Sea rises up again however its
jaw apparently drops off and falls to the deck and lands on Snorri

SNORRI

Aaah

eitel nervously picks it up and holds it up for everyone to see I
is a strand of sea-weed The Vikings are non-plussed They look
back at their now jawless monster Harald Missionary picks up the sea-
weed

HARALD

Some dragon Ooh

He tosses it back amongst his terrifies companions Suddenly there
is an incredibly loud clap of thunder and flames shoot out of the
mist

SVEN

Look out

As unbelievably a huge monstrous visage looms out of the
mist It is a creature from the nethermost depths of the
ocean and the incandescent globe is no more than a sprouting on

the end of its nose More fire shoots out from its nostrils and
sends all the Vikings (and even Harald Missionary) diving for the
deck Then the monstrous head disappears back into the mist as
quickly as it came taking its light with it The Vikings are
paralysed with fear for one brief moment

ERIK

Row ROW

They all scramble for the oars in a determined hysteria Ivar
the drummer in his panic has set a ridiculously fast rate and

nobody can keep up with it

ERIK
Slower Nobody can row at that speed
IVAR

(hoarsely)

Sorry

HARALD

Whats all the panic about

SVENS DAD

(in a panic shouting back over his shoulder)
The Dragon

Harald gives a patronising smile
HARALD

Children afraid of the dark

Suddenly there is another roar and flames shoot out of the mist
and across the deck of GOLDEN DRAGON One man Ornolf
Fishdriver who hasnt had much to say so far is set on fire
Another Bjarni Jerusalem-Farer who has and will have even less

to say then Ornolf Fishdriver leaps out of the way of the flames and
falls over the side

THORFINN

Man over board

Thorfinn starts trying to fish him out Ivar has started to panic
and is beating the drum too fast

ERIK

Slower In Out
IVAR

Sorry

SVEN

(his eyes showing their whites)
Were being attacked KILL Kill Kill
SVENS DAD

Not now Sven

SVEN

I must KILL Kill

SVENS DAD

Its no good going berserk against a dragon

Svens dad slaps him around the face There is another roar from
the monster Erik turns to Ivar

ERIK

Faster

IVAR

Make your mind up

Suddenly the Dragons head appears out of the mists above them
once again There is panic amongst the Vikings as some start to row
faster than others Screams

ERIK

Keep up the strike

The Dragons jaws open Flame licks out and down the centre of
the vessel There are screams as the Vikings leap out of the way Sven
goes berserk again

SVEN

KILL KILL

SVENS DAD

Stop it

The Dragons eyes dilate and its jaws open The men throw themselves

to the deck as if expecting more fire But instead the creatures
fangs crash into the wood of the stern of GOLDEN DRAGON
ERIK

ROW

SVEN

DEATH

SVENS DAD

Shut UP

ERIK

Row

Erik looks around at his terror-stricken crew He realizes this is
an important moment It is up to him to save the situation
Suddenly an idea occurs to him as he catches sight of the pillow
that his mother gave him

ERI
Keep rowing

Erik dashes to his sea-chest under the mast and pulls out the pillow

THORFINN

Erik Row What are you doing

ERI
(holding up the pillow)

It saved my father

Erik starts to shin up the mast

SNORRI

Barmy

Svens dad is desperately holding Sven back
SVENS DAD

HOLD it HOLD it in
SVEN

DEATH TO DRAGONS

ERIK

Row

SNORRI

Has anyone told him weve got a dragon eating our boat

Erik has reached the top of the mast and is now right up with
the incandescent globe on the end of the long stalk that grows
onto the monsters nose He grabs hold of it and swings across
onto the monsters nose At his moment Sven breaks free of his dad
and throws himself onto one of the Dragons teeth

SVEN

Red mist

He bangs his head against the monstrous denture Svens dad
looks heavenward in despair Cut to Harald Missionary who is
offering his bible to the petrifies Vikings in the prow

HARALD

Its at time like this that youll find this book MOST useful you
know

eitel takes the bible from him and hits him over the head with it

EITEL

Row You idiot

The monsters eyes dilate wildly as they try to focus on the
tiny figure of Erik on its snout Erik shoves the pillow up one
of the Dragons nostrils Snorri watches Erik incredulously He
shakes his head

SNORRI

His father went crazy too Used to take forty winks in the middle
of a battle
Thorfinn frowns - he has a glimmering of an idea of what Erik is
doing Erik now plunges his sword through the pillow in the Dragons
nostril and feathers immediately fly into the air

ERIK
Now take a deep breath

The Dragon goes cross-eyed trying to see whats going on on its
snout

ERIK
Go on Breathe in you cod-brain

Meanwhile the Dragons tongue suddenly licks out around its tooth
Sven instantly slices through it with his sword The bright blood
purts like bursting a sausage The Dragon gives an agonized roar
nd a sharp intake of breath The feathers that have leaked out from
he pillow are instantly sucked inside and the whole pillow
isappears right up the Dragons nose For a moment everyone holds
heir breath The Dragons eye dilate wildly Then it wrinkles its
nout Then it starts what is unmistakably a sneeze

ountadkoen

THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA

Ah ah ah
ERIK
Hold TIGHT

THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA
Ah ah ah

Erik leaps back across the mast
THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA
CHOO

A hurricane of wind and feathers blasts out of the Dragons
nostrils and hits all the Vikings at once Everyone is disgusted by
the Dragons breath

SNORRI

Urgh Whats it been eating
But the blast has already catapulted the boat into the sky and
it hurtles through the clouds leaving the Dragon of the North Sea
far behind They all look up at Erik and cheer Shot of Erik He
doesnt look too happy Neither does Ivar the Boneless because he
too has just noticed that they are now flying and the ocean is
several thousand feet below them Ivar screams The other all rush to
the side to look too

ERIK

No No Get back

Unfortunately they all rush to the SAME side and the boat tips
over with far more instability than when it is in the water
Leif and Thangbrand are catapulted down into the sea We watch them
descend into tiny dots and tiny unheard splashes below

THORFINN

Who was that

SNORRI

Leif the Lucky

Others are almost falling out There is renewed panic

ERIK

Get back

Poor Erik is still up the mast but has been dislodged and is
now hanging on by his hands dangling over the open sea Some of the
men - Thorfinn and Sven the Berserk amongst them - are hauling
themselves up the almost vertical slope of the deck trying to
redress the balance Meanwhile Keitel Blacksmith is dangling by one
hand

KEITEL

I cant hold on I cant hold on

Sven worms his way along the edge - at great peril to himself -
and grabs Keitels wrist just as his fingers slip

KEITEL

Aaagh
SVEN

Got you

Keitel looks up in Svens eyes He is totally at Svens mercy
What thoughts are going through his mind How is he going to betray
Sven in future if he is rescued Guilt suddenly overwhelms him
KEITEL

Let me go Sven

SVEN

What are you talking about

KEITEL

Im not worth risking your life for

SVEN

Ive got you Keitel Blacksmith If you go I go too

KEITEL

For your own sake For the others I

SVEN

Hang on

The boat begins to right itself just as Erik finally cant hold on
any more and he plummets straight into the ship and through the
bottom up to his waist His legs dangle At the same moment the prov
of the boat tips and suddenly they are plummeting down towards the
ocean They hit the water with an almighty splash Erik is thrown
clear of the hull by the force of the water now cascading up through
the hole he has made

SNORRI

First were flying - now were sinking

ERIK

Well come on
He whisks off his helmet and starts bailing All follow suit
Night falls Some time later The Vikings are still bailing out but
the water is up to their thighs

IVAR THE BONELESS

Who are we fooling Its hopeless

Ivar flings down the helmet with which hes been bailing The
others look at each other They are reconciled to the fact that they
are going to drown

HARALD MISSIONARY

(hopelessly)

Lets sing something

SNORRI

Anyone know any good drowning songs

The suggestion falls flat

ERIK

Listen Maybe we wont get to Hy-Brasil Maybe we wont find the
Horn Resounding but at least weve tried and at least we shall

have died like men

SNORRI

Like fish

SVEN

Shut up

THORFINN

(raising his sword)

Eriks right Well all meet in Valhalla
IVAR

I donT want to die

HARALD MISSIONARY
Isnt there ANYBODY whod like to be christened before we go down
Silence A distinct lack of enthusiasm

HARALD

It cant do you any HARM

SVENS DAD

What do we have to do

HARALD

Nothing I just immerse you in water

THORFINN AND OTHERS

Get lost

The ship creaks and starts to go under Erik picks his up his
sword The others follow suit

ERIK
Dont let me drown Thorfinn

Water starts to pour over the sides of the boat Erik and
Thorfinn raise their swords to each other

THORFINN
Till we meet in Valhalla
They all prepare to run each other through The boat sinks rapidly

VAR THE BONELESS

m too young Oh Odin Not me Please not me Perhaps Id rather
drown

HARALD MISSIONARY

I do WISH youd let me convert you

Then Erik pauses in his attempt to kill Thorfinn and looks around
The ship has sunk but the prow and the stern posts are still

sticking up out of the water and the Vikings themselves are
only up to their chests
ERIK

How deep IS the ocean
THORFINN

Very deep usually

The realization gradually dawns on the Vikings that theyre not
going to sink any more

ERIK

Wait Nobody kill anybody

Fade Fade up on the sun shining down from a blue sky The
Vikings have fallen asleep where we last saw them - up to their
necks in water Gradually the warmth of the sun coaxes them awake

- Thorfinn is the first to look up and see the brilliant shining orb
in the sky

THORFINN
What is it
VAR THE BONELESS

(he panics and turns)

ts the Dragon again

ERIK

No no it isnt

var has turned and is staring at something else
ERIK

Look the sky is blue

SVENS DAD

The sun Thats it

var meanwhile is recovering from the amazement that has
immobilized him He taps Erik on the shoulder Erik turns and he too
gasps
ERIK

Look

They all turn to see they are standing in the shallow waters of
a natural harbour Above nestle the white walls of a beautiful city
set in a green and pleasant land

VIKINGS

Yeaaaah

The Vikings wade ashore enchanted by the paradise they see
before them All at once Thorfinn spies something He draws his sword
and they all approach with caution to find that under a weeping willow
tree lies the most beautiful girl She is raven-haired scantily
dressed and fast asleep The Vikings approach her with trepidation
their swords and axes drawn They glance around uneasily

SNORRI

(whispers)

Shes got no clothes on

THORFINN

Its disgusting

ERIK

Get her weapons

Sven kneels quietly beside the girl She stirs Sven freezes
The others look around fearfully

SVEN

(whispers)

She hasnt got any

ERIK

(incredulous)

She MUST have a knife or something

But they look She hasnt
THORFINN
What kind of place IS this

IVAR THE BONELESS

P pperhaps theyve got weapons we havent even dreamed of

Suddenly the girl stirs again in her sleep The Vikings retreat

several paces and grip their weapons
expecting an ambush

THORFINN

Lets hack her to pieces

ERIK

No

KEITEL

Well what else do we do

ERIK

How about making friends

SVEN

(with disgust)

FRIENDS

VIKINGS

Eurrgh

ERIK

Whats wrong with making friends
THORFINN

You dont go through all the hardships

SVEN

and glance

of an ocean

around as if

We can make friends at home

This conversation has woken the girl Aud

AUD

swords and axes

ERIK

AUD

ERIK
(suspiciously)

ERIK

SVEN

AUD

Aud instantly recoils with terror

Aud with incredulity

ERIK

Cut to big close-up of King Arnulf

KING ARNULF

The wonderful blessing under which we live here on Hy-Brasil

The king beams The Vikings shift uneasily They look out of place
and extremely scruffy in the midst of the scantily dressed
courtiers of Hy-Brasil Aud sits beside her father the King

ERIK

No we dont

KING ARNULF

The Gods decreed that if ever sword spills human blood upon these
shores the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves

King Arnulf beams rapturously at the Vikings expecting them to
be overjoyed Instead they are horrified
THORFINN

Thats terrible

ERIK

You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed
KING ARNULF

Yes

(He thinks isnt it wonderful)

The Vikings look at each other feeling they havent quite understood
THORFINN

You mean you cant kill ANYBODY

KING ARNULF

Right Isnt it wonderful

The Vikings are non-plussed

THORFINN

What Not being able to kill anybody

KING ARNULF

(bemused)

Well of course

ERIK

(interested)

Well for a start er theres no killing

ERIK
Well OBVIOUSLY theres no killing
KING ARNULF

Well

THORFINN

But how dyou take revenge

EITEL

(guiltily)

IVAR

ING ARNULF

(getting a little irritated)

Aud catches Eriks eye and gives him
pause of disbelief from the Vikings

SVEN

KING ARNULF

He turns and conducts the courtiers

COURT

a dangerously slow wink

who chant in unison

A
Being nice to each other is what its all about

KING ARNULF

(rising as if to sing)

You see

They hold the note while King Arnulf looks anxiously at the Vikings
KING ARNULF

ERIK

King Arnulf claps and the court stop singing

KING ARNULF

KING ARNULF

TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM

COURT

(disappointed)

Oh

CHAMBERLAIN

KING ARNULF
(apologetically to Vikings)

It isnt the one were BEST at

CHAMBERLAIN

Couldnt we do the one that goes TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM
The rest of the court look hopeful

KING ARNULF

(whispering)

Not when weve got guests

VOICE FROM COURT

KING ARNULF

CHAMBERLAIN

CHAMBERLAIN

KING ARNULF

All right Well do the one that goes TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM-
TI-TI-TUM Ah The musicians

The musicians are huge unshaven have broken noses and tattoos
and are covered in black oil - like mechanics Their instruments are
like heavy industrial machinery pushed in large vats of black oil
that drip all over the show

KING ARNULF

Right Oh dear

(he glances across at the Vikings)

Im sure

youre not going to like this

Erik and the others smile reassuringly There is a lot of coughing
The King raises his baton and then brings it down humming to
himself as he does so There is a most awful din caterwauling
crashing and banging whining screaming The Vikings look at each
other trying to pick out some tune but its impossible Ivar the
Boneless cant stop himself bursting out into giggles and this
eventually spreads to the other Vikings King Arnulf notices and
bangs the throne for silence Gradually the din stops King Arnulf
sinks down in despair

KING ARNULF

(tragically)

Were just not a very musical nation
ERIK

No no It was very er nice

KING ARNULF

Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY totally genuinely honest with
me Did you really truly honestly like it

Erik thinks for some moments and then decides to make a clean breast
of it

ERIK

No

KING ARNULF

(goes hysterically)

They didnt like it Oh God I want to die

The whole court looks as if its about to commit mass HARA-KIRI
while the musicians look rather dangerous Erik takes the moment to
get down to business

ERIK

Your Majesty We come from a world where there IS no music
where men live and die by the axe and by the sword

KING ARNULF

Well how dyou think I feel

ERIK

The Gods are asleep King Arnulf

KING ARNULF

YOU try to be nice to people when theyre rude about your
singing

Erik feels he is making a mess of all this diplomacy
ERIK

We must find the Horn Resounding

The King glares at Erik

ERIK

Is is HERE in Hy-Brasil

King Arnulf thinks for a moment and then speaks

KING ARNULF

Ill tell you what

ERIK

Yes

King Arnulf hesitates - he bites his lip and then takes the plunge
KING ARNULF
Well do the one that goes TUM-TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM

Perhaps youll like that better

Erik gives up A lot of throat clearing Aud the Kings
daughter gives Erik another dangerously slow wink The terrible
music starts up shattering the calm of the beautiful city Fade
Fade up on GOLDEN DRAGON now afloat once more riding at anchor in
the bay Ivar is standing on guard in it Suddenly he sees something
that makes him gabe in horror We dont find out what it is
however because we immediately Cut to Erik He is deeply in love
He is also in bed with the Kings nubile daughter Aud

AUD

Have you ever felt like this about anyone else
ERIK

What you mean got into bed with them

AUD

No of course not silly - I mean FELT like this about the
ERIK

You mean you HAVE got into bed with somebody else

AUD

No I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your
life youd met somebody you could believe in with your whole
heart someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals
whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams

ERIK

HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else

AUD

What does that matter But youve youve FELT like this
before

ERIK

It was different

AUD

(just for a moment it is Helga speaking)

What was she like

ERIK

Oh oh I didnt know her very well

AUD

But you LOVED her all the same

ERIK

We never went to bed together

AUD

Why do you go on about that What does it matter
ERIK

Youve been to bed with somebody else havent you
AUD

Ive never LOVED anybody

ERIK

IVE never been to bed with anybody
Suddenly there is a banging on he door
KING ARNULF

(vo)

Open up I know youre in there

AUD

Ah Its my father

KING ARNULF (vo)

Open up I know youre in there

Suddenly the note from Ivars horn rings out across from the bay
Erik rushes to the window and looks out to see what Ivar saw
previously a black ship approaching on the horizon

ERIK

Oh no Halfdan

There is more banging on the bedroom door

KING ARNULF (vo)

Aud Youve got someone in there again havent you
Erik gives her a sharp look

AUD

Quick Throw this over you
She throws a shabby bit of cloth over Erik and at that moment the
door bursts open and King Arnulf enters

KING ARNULF

Right Where is he

AUD

Who Father

KING ARNULF

Who Who Whoever youve got in here of course

AUD

There IS no one

The King starts prowling round the chamber Erik stands there

naked and petrified with the cloak hanging over his head just
where it landed

KING ARNULF

I can SMELL one of those strangers Thats who it is isnt
it

Aud keeps mum

KING ARNULF

This is the fifth one this week

Before he can stop himself Erik blurts out

ERIK

Fifth

Aud motions him to be quiet but its too late The King spins round
to see who she is signalling to The King appears to be looking
straight at Erik Erik can hardly bear the suspense

KING ARNULF

Well where is he
AUD

Theres nobody here Father Look for yourself

King Arnulf looks around the chamber carefully He looks
straight through Erik as if he werent there Suddenly the King
strides over to Erik and Erik instinctively cowers out of the
way The King walks straight over to a very small cupboard no more
than a foot high flings the door of it open and starts throwing
clothes around the room

AUD

He wouldnt be a midget Father

The King turns on her

KING ARNULF

Ah So you admit there IS someone

AUD

Youre losing your temper

KING

(becoming instantly pleasant)

Of course Im not I never lose my temper

Ivars horn sounds again A shadow passes over King Arnulfs face
ING ARNULF

Oh dear more visitors

He strides to the window and sees Halfdans ship As he does so
Erik has to leap out of the way inadvertently knocking a chest
The King spins round and addresses the chest

ING ARNULF

Come out come out like a man I know youre in there

ing Arnulf flings the chest open revealing nothing but clothes He
is baffled He reluctantly starts to leave

AUD
(gently)

Its all in your own mind Father Its YOU who imagine that
Im always up here with some man or other

KING ARNULF

I dont know how you do it Aud I sometimes think youve got
some of your mothers magic

He suddenly spies a small trinket-box and looks in that But he
doesnt find any strange man in it

AUD

There is no magic Father My mother had no magic

KING ARNULF

She did I tell you She could blind me as easily as the night
the day

AUD

Its your fantasy

KING ARNULF

But one day Ill catch you Like I caught her

He leaves Aud closes the door Erik throws the cloak off and
starts getting dressed

AUD

The Cloak Invisible It was my mothers parting gift
ERIK

The fifth one this week

AUD

Oh for goodness sake

ERIK
And I thought you said it was something special
Aud runs to his side and puts her arms around him
AUD

Thats just what I was trying to tell you You ARE
ERIK

Five this week how many the week before

AUD

Youre as bad as my father

ERIK

And the week before that

ERIK

Erik

(she is really sincere)

I want to help you get to

Asgaard

Erik is torn He doesnt know whether to believe her or not
Ivars horn sounds for a third time Erik races to the window He
looks out Halfdans ship is even closer

ERIK

We mustnt let him land
AUD

Who

ERIK

Halfdan the Black

AUD

But Erik
But Erik is off out of the door
AUD
No Wait My father will be -

There is a thump and a yell as Erik is
two musicians

KING ARNULF

I might have known it was you
MUSICIAN 1

(pinning Eriks arms behind him)
Im not hurting you am I

ERIK

What

MUSICIAN 2

You WILL tell us if we hurt you

ERIK
Let me go

Erik struggles

ING ARNULF

(to musicians)

Careful

(to Erik)

Theyre not supposed to hurt you
ERIK

Youve got to let me go

They start to march Erik through the palace

set

upon by the Kings
MUSICIAN 2

Oh no We can hold onto you - just so long we dont squeeze too
or bump you

In the distance we hear the horn again
ERIK

Halfdan the Blacks here

They have reached a cell The musicians starts to chain Erik up

KING ARNULF

Its all part of our safety regulations You see if someone
were to get hurt they might get angry and then well
ERIK

Theyll be more than hurt if Halfdan the Black lands Ow
MUSICIAN

Ooh Im terribly sorry

KING ARNULF

Who is Halfdan the Black

ERIK

Hes trying to stop us waking the Gods

KING ARNULF

Why

ERIK

Because thats how he makes his money by war and plunder
KING ARNULF

Dont talk nonsense

ERIK

hard
He wants to kill US

KING ARNULF

Not when we explain about the Great Blessing
ERIK

You dont know Halfdan the Black

KING ARNULF

I know that the Great Blessing has kept

the

peace fora

thousand years and will keep it for the next thousand

The horn sounds again Erik is about to argue this point when

Thorfinn suddenly bursts in
THORFINN

Erik
MUSICIAN 2

Were not hurting him

MUSICIAN 1

(to Erik)

Are we

ERIK

Just let me go

THORFINN

Halfdan the Blacks here
ERIK

I know

THORFINN

(to the King)
He wants to KILL us

They both look at King Arnulf The King thinks

ERIK

You dont want him to kill us ON Hy-Brasil Do you

The King thinks some more The horn sounds once more Cut to GOLDEN
DRAGON Erik and the Vikings are scrambling into their war gear
They glance nervously over to where Halfdan the Blacks ship is
riding on the waves

THORFINN

feel strange

Erik looks at Thorfinn shocked

VAR THE BONELESS

(his throat dry)

Sort of wobbly and excited

THORFINN

Sort of

IVAR

Thats fear

SVEN

But Thorfinn doesnt know the meaning of fear
THORFINN

Is it sort of like a sinking feeling in your stomach
IVAR

Thats it

ERIK

But Youre not even afraid of DEATH Thorfinn
THORFINN

I know I know

SVENS DAD

Its magic

ERIK

What magic

SVENS DAD

Ive heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart
so you cannot fight
SVEN

(deadly serious)

Yes I can feel it
VAR THE BONELESS
(eagerly)

always feel like this

Suddenly Halfdans ship rises up out of the water and revealing
the secret of its hidden power Under the water-line is another
line of oars The Vikings are dumbfounded Ivar drops trembling to
his knees The rest go white Thorfinn draws his sword Erik realizes
his men are rapidly talking themselves into a blue funk

ERIK

Its not magic Its just a trick
THORFINN

(turning on him angrily)

Dont you FEEL it

Erik looks around at his paralysed crew He realizes he is the only
one who can save the situation
ERIK
Very well It theyre using magic - well use magic of our own

He leaps out of GOLDEN DRAGON and races up to the shore towards
the city of Hy-Brasil Erik races into the Forum and gazes up at the
high walls of the Palace Without a thought he produces two daggers
and plunges them into the stonework Then he hauls himself up the
sheer cliff of wall up to Auds bedchamber fist over fist It is
indeed a prodigious feat He arrives at Auds window exhausted Aud
who has appeared at the window looks at him curiously

AUD

Why didnt you come up by the stairs

Erik looks around and notices for the first time the
magnificent flights of stairs leading up to the top of Auds tower

ERIK

(rather miffed)

Just give me a hand

AUD

I mean you could have killed yourself
Erik clambers into Auds room

ERIK

Wheres the Cloak Invisible

AUD

Why

Erik looks around and is suddenly suspicious
ERIK

I cant see it

(Indignation suddenly seizes him)

Have you got
another man in here

Erik starts feeling the air as if expecting to find an invisible body
AUD

Its in the chest

Erik races over and grabs the cloak

AUD

No

ERIK

Ill bring it back

AUD

Erik You dont understand

ERIK

No Its YOU who doesnt understand Aud Halfdan has come to
kill and destroy We brought him here We must stop him

AUD

(pointing at the cloak)

But you dont realize

ERIK

Goodbye Aud

Erik leaps out of the window For a moment Aud is surprised and
then alarmed as she realizes hes jumped out of the window which
is some forty feet off the ground

AUD
Erik
She rushes to the window in time to see Erik parachuting down

holding the four corners of the cloak Erik lands safely and waves
with the cloak
ERIK

And thanks for the Cloak Invisible

AUD

No WAIT ERIK The Cloak The CLoak Invisible It only seems
to work on my father

But Erik cannot hear her He is already racing back to his ship Back
on GOLDEN DRAGON Thorfinn is taking Being Scared lessons from
var the Boneless

THORFINN
And a sort of slightly sick feeling
VAR

hats it AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory

THORFINN
Oh yes I hadnt noticed that

SNORR

Oh shut up you two Youre making us ALL nervous
Erik leaps into GOLDEN DRAGON brandishing the Cloak Invisible

ERIK

So Halfdan the Blacks using magic is he Well I have a magic
to match his

(he holds up the Cloak Invisible)

KEITEL

What is it

SNORRI

A magic dishcloth

ERIK
To the oars

THORFINN

Dyou think Ive got time to go behind that bush

Ivar starts to drum and the Vikings begin to row GOLDEN DRAGON
heads out of the harbour Cut to Halfdan the Black flanked by his
advisers Gisli Oddsson and Eilif the Mongul He gives a nod and Eilif
bangs his staff of office on the deck as a signal for the galley
slaves to speed up Down in the galley the slave master (a
diminutive Japanese)

stalks down the decks lashing the sweat-streaked galley slaves
and cursing them in incomprehensive Japanese Fortunately (or
perhaps unfortunately)

a translation appears in subtitles

SLAVE-DRIVER

(subtitled)

Row You incomprehensible horizontal-eyed Western
trouser-wearers Eurgh You all look the same to me How I
despise your lack of subtlety and your joined-up writing You

who have never committed ritual suicide in your lives

SLAVE

(whispering to his neighbour)

You know I dont think it would be so bad

if we knew what he was saying

SLAVE-DRIVER

SILENCE Unceremonious rice-pudding eaters How I abominate
your milk-drinking and your lack of ancestor-worship and your

failure to eat your lunch out of little boxes

Meanwhile the Vikings are growing increasingly uneasy as they
row towards Halfdan
SVENS DAD

What magic have you brought Erik

ERIK

Youll see

At this point back on the Black Ship Halfdan gives another nod
and Eilif raps out yet another command with his staff This time the
prow of the Black Ship opens up like a pair of jaws The Vikings see
it and panic

IVAR THE BONELESS

Ive done it

THORFINN

Oh yes

(he has too)

Halfdan nods again and another order is rapped out This time a
harpoon is fired from the prow It thuds into gOLDEN DRAGON
and two of Halfdans dog-soldiers start to winch the line in The
two ships are hauled closer and closer The Vikings panic even more
Erik holds up the Cloak Invisible and grins round at his men
knowing he is going to surprise them

ERI

Here Here is the magic from the Kings daughter

Eriks men watch half sceptical and half hopeful Erik enjoys
the moment of suspense The he throws the Cloak Invisible over his
head and shoulders and grins round at his men triumphantly
imagining he has vanished from their sight

ERIK
There I have become the wind

The Vikings look at him rather puzzled Only Harald seems to
be impressed

HARALD

How did he do that
SVENS DAD

Do what

HARALD

Vanish into thin air

SVENS DAD
He hasnt
HARALD

Well where is he then

arald looks around He is the only one who cant see Erik

SVENS DAD

es THERE

At this point Halfdans ship suddenly bites into the side of
GOLDEN DRAGON Erik leaps onto the side of GOLDEN DRAGON and
swings across onto Halfdans ship The Vikings react to the horror of
Halfdans ship biting into GOLDEN DRAGON and to Eriks blithe
leap onto the enemy boat Erik lands on the deck of Halfdans
ship and grins at the ferocious skull-helmeted dog-soldiers
ERIK

Ooh Scary Scary Dont we look mean

Two dog-soldiers look at each other totally non-plussed Erik
grimaces at Halfdans men and does a little pirouette to show
them all that hes invisible from every angle

ERIK

You cant see me But I can see you

He breaks into a little dance Halfdan glares at his advisers
HALFDAN

Whats going on

GISLI ODDSSON
Thats Erik
HALFDAN
Well why isnt he scared of us

Erik meanwhile approaches one of the dog-soldiers and makes
silly faces at him

ERIK

Boo

The dog-soldier topples overboard The galley slaves watch
another dog-soldier fall into the hold amongst them and lie there
stunned His sword falls onto the deck between the slaves One of the
slaves throws down his oar and picks up the dog-soldiers sword
The slave-master suddenly appears Once again he speaks immaculate
JApanese

SLAVE-MASTER

(subtitled)

Hey Whats going on Your big-breasted women give me

no pleasure with their warmed-up fish and Urgh

The slave-master strides down the ship to flay the offending slave
but another slave trips him up and in a twinkling of an eye four
others have leapt on the slave-master (despite their chains)
and are extracting his keys

HALFDAN

Whats the matter Havent you seen anyone fight before

DOG-SOLDIER 1

No

DOG-SOLDIER 2

Theyre usually too scared of us

HALFDAN

ILL him
Erik still thinking hes invisible is running amongst the
dog- soldiers having fun He runs one dog-soldier through and kicks
another overboard then he runs past a few more right up to Halfdan
himself He whisks the Cloak Invisible off his head for an instant

ERIK
(thinking hes revealing himself)

Here I am

Then he turns and is off Halfdan turns to his aides
HALFDAN
What

Back on GOLDEN DRAGON the Vikings disbelief has turned to
admiration

SVENS DAD

There THATS a true Berserk

SVEN

Im just building up to it Dad

Sven starts banging his head on the side of the boat
SNORRI

Hes gone batty

THORFINN

No The fears gone

Halfdan grabs a sword off one of his dead dog-soldiers and thrusts
it into the unwilling hands of his military adviser Eilif

HALFDAN
Fight damn you Fight

Cut back to GOLDEN DRAGON Now Sven leaps across onto Halfdans
ship followed by Ivar yelling Snorri looks back at Keitel

SNORRI
Well Come on

EITEL

eitel is thinking Maybe I should let Halfdan win but he knows
he cant let a thing like that happen now he is faced with the
reality of it The companionship of the voyage has brought them all
too close for that

EITEL
(under his breath)

Hang the Blacksmiths Code

eitel leaps to his feet and joins in the attack Erik meanwhile is
swinging across the deck from a rope

ERIK

I am the air I am the wind

Keitel and Thorfinn are now fighting side by side

THORFINN

This is life eh

Keitel grins and strikes out Ivar turns on Eilif who has
reluctantly joined the fray Maybe hes singled Ivar out as the most
harmless Ivar suddenly realizes hes only armed with drumsticks
Eilif smiles evilly

IVAR

Ooh er

Eilifs sword slices through Ivars drumsticks Ivar turns to run
but is stopped by a dog-soldier Eilif takes the opportunity to
run him through from behind

IVAR

(as he dies)

Ouch
Erik sees Ivars demise
ERI
Ivar

Erik leaps to take revenge He jumps into the galley-pit and out
again a la Douglas Fairbanks in THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD and
dispatches Eilif with a single thrust Sven and his dad are fighting
surrounded by dog- soldiers

SVENS DAD

Well go on Go berserk

SVEN

GIVE US A CHANCE Dad

Snorri appears from behind

SNORRI

(to Svens dad)

What about you Why dont YOU go berserk

SVENS DAD

I got to keep my eye on HIM

Svens dad looks uneasy He is surrounded and as a
seasoned campaigner knows they havent much chance Halfdan smiles
to himself The battle is going his way Thorfinn meanwhile is
fighting two dog- soldiers but is attacked from behind by a third
SVEN
Look out Thorfinn

But its too late Thorfinn is run through the back Sven goes
berserk and kills all three dog-soldiers Svens dad looks on proud
of his son for the first time Maybe their relationship will never
be the same again Now Snorri sees something that cheers him up
SLaves are coming up from below to join the battle They are armed
with oars and swords They join the fray knocking dog-soldiers
overboard with their oars The dog-soldier are suddenly outnumbered

Halfdans smile fades and he looks around for an escape route The
tide of battle has now turned dramatically as dog-soldier after dog-

soldier is tossed over the side or laid low by the combination of
Vikings and slaves Halfdan and Gisli slip into a lifeboat and
sneak off The rats are leaving the sinking ship Back on the deck
all the dog-soldiers are dead or overboard The slaves and
Vikings are cheering and embracing each other At the other end of
the boat Sven is cradling the dying Thorfinn in his arms All
around are jubilant slaves celebrating their freedom

SVEN

Thorfinn You cant die

THORFINN

Im not frightened of anything

SVEN

Youll see my grandfather in Valhalla

THORFINN

(dying)

No hes not not there

SVEN

Tell him Im coming

Thorfinn dies Sven holds him and a tear comes down his face
The danger has made comrades of the two rivals Erik however is
still fighting a last lone dog-soldier but just as he is about to
run him through the dog-soldier is stabbed in the back He sinks to
the floor revealing another dog-soldier Erik is outraged by this
act of treachery and turns on the assassin

DOG-SOLDIER

No No Wait Please wait Erik

The dog-soldier pulls his mask off to reveal he is in fact Loki
Erik is totally non-plussed

ERIK
LOKI Where did YOU come from

LOKI
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods so I disguised
myself to sabotage their plans

Erik has meanwhile been joined by the remaining comrades

LOK
To save YOU Erik

Erik is about to say But how can you’ see me Im wearing the
Cloak Invisible

ERI
But -

LOKI

t was my master Keitels idea

All eyes turn on Keitel who looks very uncomfortable
LOKI

Wasnt it Keitel

EITEL

Well I I thought

eitel is overcome b the power of Lokis will but he is deeply
ashamed of his complicity in Lokis deeds Snorri gazes at Keitel
with growing suspicion

ERIK

But How is it you can see me

(he looks round)

You can all

see me

LOKI

What dyou mean
SNORRI AND OTHERS

Why shouldnt we see you

HARALD

I cant see him

ERIK

Im wearing the Cloak Invisible

Erik takes it off to demonstrate

HARALD

Oh There you are

ERIK

(to the others)

You mean you could see me all the time

The Vikings look at each other mystified

SNORRI

Werent we supposed to

ERIK

Oh I feel a little oh

Eriks knees give way and he faints onto the deck Cut to Kings Hall
some time later A victory celebration is in progress It is a
little bit like a Hampstead cocktail party and the rough battle-
stained Vikings look rather out of place holding their little
canapes Suddenly the King claps for silence

KING ARNULF

We are grateful to you Erik and to your men

COURT

Yes we are

KING ARNULF
And there is only ONE way we can repay you Musicians

King arnulf claps his hands Erik rushes over to him anxious to
avoid another Hy-Brasilian concert

ERIK

(hurriedly)

Well wed love to hear you sing again but what wed really
appreciate would be if you could see your way to lending not
giving of course

(continuing) but just lending us the

um the well to be quite blunt the Horn Resounding

All the time Erik is talking the doors of the hall behind are
opening and a vast lur or horn is carried in by six bearers One or
two of the Vikings have turned to look and are now standing
speechless King Arnulf beams at Erik

KING ARNULF

Its yours

Now Erik finally turns and looks at what everyone else is looking
at Eriks jaw drops Everyone in the court beams at Erikexcept Aud
who is looking sad and disappointed

ERIK

(when he can find his voice)

Is THAT it

A cloud passes over King Arnulfs happy face

KING ARNULF

Is there something the matter with it

ERIK

Oh No No of course not its just I hadnt expected it to be
quite so big
KING ARNULF

Well its not called the Horn Resounding for nothing

(aside)

You DO know how to play the horn dont you

ERIK

Yes oh yes

KING ARNULF

Then I expect youll be leaving first thing in the morning

The King manhandles Erik away from his daughter Perhaps we have
the feeling that shes isnt going to let Erik go as easily as
thatMix through to later that night The Vikings are lying asleep
on the Great Hall beside the Horn Resounding The camera closes
in on Keitel Suddenly a voice comes from the shadows

VOICE

(whispering)

Keitel Keitel Blacksmith

Keitel opens his eyes and finds Loki close beside him

LOKI

Whats the matter Keitel Blacksmith Have you forgotten why you
came on this voyage

eitel is silent

LOKI

Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods
EITEL

How can we stops him now

Loki looks around and then opens his hand in front of Keitel In it
is the mouthpiece from the Horn Resounding

LOKI
Take this and throw it from the cliff heights Theyll never make
the Horn Resounding sound without it

Keitel frowns Then an obvious thought limps across his muscular mind
KEITEL

But why me Why dont you do it

Somebody stirs

LOK
Sh Hurry
EITEL

YOU do it

LOK
Youll be able to throw it further than I could
eitel thinks This is true

LOKI

t must go far out to sea

Loki presses the mouthpiece on Keitel Keitel takes it
but reluctantly Another Viking stirs

LOKI
Surely you havent forgotten the Blacksmiths Oath

eitel is about to reply and say hes been having second thoughts
about it but somehow he cant Loki has such power over him

EITEL

Suddenly another Viking stirs and Loki hisses at him
LOKI

Hurry
Loki pretend to go back to sleep Keitel (feeling a bit
lumbered) thinks about his task and hesitates Who knows Perhaps
he is about to stand firm but Loki plays his trump card

LOKI

(without opening his eyes)

Or I might have to tell Erik why you really came on this voyage

Keitel is caught He closes his eyes in resignation and
then reluctantly starts to make his way out of the Hall As he gets
to the doors he trips over Snorri who wakes The mouthpiece falls a
few feet away

SNORRI

Whos that

KEITEL

Its me Im just going to water the dragon
(he gives a false laugh)

SNORRI

Oh

Snorri notices the silver mouthpiece on the floor but he pretends
he hasnt

SNORRI
Oh clumsy idiot

Snorri pretends to go back to sleep but he opens one eye and
watches Keitel Blacksmith recover the mouthpiece and then follows
Keitel out Loki gets up too He follows to keep an eye on Snorri Cut
to Aud on the shore gazing moodily out to sea She is brooding in
Eriks imminent departure Suddenly a stone falls from above she
looks up and sees a figure appear on the cliff above Hurriedly she
withdraws into the shadows Keitel Blacksmith appears on the cliff-
top In his hands he holds the mouthpiece of the Horn Resounding e
examines it turning over in his mind whether he is doing the right
thing or not then he decides he must

KEITEL
(to himself)

My fellow blacksmiths
He prepares to throw it
SNORR
eitel

eitel jumps out of his skin

EITEL
What
SNORR
What are you doing Keitel Blacksmith
KEITEL

Get away Snorri

SNORR
What have you got there

Snorri advances towards Keitel Keitel backs away dangerously near
to the edge of the cliff His boot slips and he jerks himself
forward At the same time Snorri makes a grab for the mouthpiece A
scuffle ensues during which the mouthpiece of the Horn
Resounding is dropped It bounces off the cliff and falls down to
the shore below Aud steps out of the shadow and picks it up She
frowns and looks up and then screams as she sees the men fighting

AUD
No

But its too late Snorri goes white gives a hideous gasp and
sinks slowly to his knees - revealing Loki standing behind him with a
bloody knife As Keitel and Loki watch Snorri die a drop of blood
from the knife falls to the ground The moment it lands there
is a deep subterranean groan and the earth begins to tremble
violently Keitel and Loki look around in alarm

KEITEL
Oh Gods What have we done

Back in the Kings Hall Sven Svens dad and Harald are wide
awake but for the moment paralysed as bits of masonry crash around
them The cheerful figure of King Arnulf appears at the top of a
stairway He raises his hands

KING ARNULF

Stay calm This is NOT happening

The King then hurries out of a door at the top of the staircase
SVENS DAD

What did he say

ERIK

Look out

The doors of the Great Hall burst open and a wall of water
crashes through knocking the Vikings off their feet There is
little doubt that the whole of Hy-Brasil is sinking see a street go
down a statue sink and then we Cut to a close-up of King Arnulf He
is standing at the top of the Forum steps addressing a crowd of
anxious citizens They are keeping surprisingly good order
considering they are already standing ankle-deep in water and the
whole town is rapidly sinking around them

KING ARNULF

Now I know what some of you must be thinking the day has
come were all going down etc etc But lets get away from
the fantasy and look at the FACTS FACT ONE - The threat of total
destruction has kept the peace for one thousand years FACT TWO - The
chances of it failing now are therefore one in three hundred and
sixty-five thousand FACT THREE

By this time the water is up to peoples knees and several
have crowded onto the lower steps to avoid getting wet

KING ARNULF

FACT THREE - Our safety regulations are the most rigorous in the
world We are all nice to each other we never rub each other up
the wrong way or contradict each other do we

CROWD
No
Rumble The buildings sink and masonry falls
CITIZEN

We er do seem to be going down quite fast Your Majesty - not
trying to contradict you course

KING ARNULF

No of course youre not citizen But lets stick to the facts
There has NEVER been ae safer more certain way of keeping the
peace So whatevers happening you can rest assured Hy-Brasil
is NOT sinking Repeat NOT sinking

We cut to an unfortunate Hy-Brasilian who looks out of a window to
see if its raining but is immersed before he can find out The
citizens in the Forum however are reassured by the Kings words -
even though they are now up to their waists in water One of them
steps forward

ANOTHER CITIZEN

May I just make a point in support of what King Arnulfs just said
KING ARNULF

Wed be delighted - wouldnt we

CITIZENS

Yes wed certainly like to hear what one of us has got to say
Erik Sven Svens dad and Harald struggle out of the Great
Hall carrying their belongings and the Horn Resounding while the
citizen is still speaking most articulately in support of the
King They are ALMOST in a panic

ERIK

What are you all doing

CITIZEN AT THE BACK
(cheerfully)

Its all right Its not happening
ERIK

(urgently)

The place is sinking
CITIZEN AT THE BACK

Yes I thought it was too but the Kings just pointed out that
it cant be

CITIZEN
(still speaking in support of the King)

and of course we mustnt forget King Arnulfs EXCELLENT eye for
flower-arranging

There is a smattering of applause A few people pull their robes up
out of the wet Erik leaps onto a wall and shouts to the crowd

ERIK
Save yourselves Hy-Brasil is sinking
There are a lot of knowing smiles amongst the citizens
CITIZEN FROM MIDDLE

Look you dont know our safety regulations

KING ARNULF

t cant happen

ERIK

But it IS Look

KING ARNULF

(ignoring Erik)

The important thing is not to panic
CITIZENS

Quite yes we understand
KING ARNULF

Ive already appointed the Chancellor as Chairman of a committee
to find out exactly what IS going on and meantime I suggest we
have a sing-song

CITIZENS

Good idea

ANOTHER

Can we do the one that goes TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM

Erik looks around in despair Meanwhile in another street someone is
struggling in the floodwater

LOK
I cant swim I cant swim
EITEL

Relax

LOK
m drowning Help

Loki grabs Keitel round the neck

EITEL

Let go

But Keitel is pulled under He re-emerges spluttering
EITEL

Urrgh Argh Let go you idiot

LOK

Help

EITEL

Youll drown us bo
But they go under again At this point Erik Sven Svens dad
and Harald swim round the corner pushing the Horn Resounding They
see the figures disappearing under the water

EITEL

Help

LOK

Help

Erik Sven and Co swim as fast as they can to rescue the
drowning pair They struggle to overpower the panic-stricken Loki
but he puts up a manic fight Unexpectedly Harald Missionary
suddenly unleashes a vicious right hook and lays Loki out cold There
is a moments stunned silence that is no unmingled with indignation

SVEN

(with hurt surprise)

You hit him

HARALD

Well its what youre supposed to do isnt it

SVENS DAD

Look

They look up as GOLDEN DRAGON sails around a corner of the
street piloted by Aud As the Vikings scramble aboard the
sound of the sing-song reaches a particularly noisy and discordant
climax attract their attention Back in what was the Forum a crowd
of unconcerned-looking citizens is sitting on the last roof and
just coming to the end of another appalling song

CITIZENS

ERIK

CITIZEN 3

Panic-monger

The roof is now sinking rapidly
as unperturbed as ever

CITIZEN

SVEN

citizens

Yeah Leave em alone

AUD

Its sinking Hy-Brasil is sinking

KING ARNULF

Well my dear I think youll find its all a question of what you
want to believe in I have slightly more experience of these

matters than you

Unfortunately at this point the entire gathering of citizens
the King and the Forum Temple disappear below the waves

AUD

Father

(tears spring to her eyes)

Harald Missionary has put his arm around Aud in a fatherly way
HARALD MISSIONARY

There my child Its at times like this that this book can be a
great help

Erik shoos him away

HARALD MISSIONARY

(with his usual promptness)
Right

GOLDEN DRAGON spins alone in the wide ocean Fade Fade up some time
later They are all gathered in front of the Horn Resounding

ERIK
(to himself)

We must blow the first note he note that will take us to
Asgaard

SVEN

(nervously and with awe in his voice)
Over the Edge of the World

The other men look up at the Horn Resounding and begin to feel a
bit nervous

ERIK

We are going where only the dead have been before

Erik takes a deep breath and then puts his lips to the Horn
Resounding He blows There is a splutter and one or two of the
Vikings titter amongst themselves He has another go But again all
he produces is a pathetic spluttering

SVEN

(not unkindly in his manner)

Uh Here Give it to me

Sven pushes Erik aside Sven blow he becomes redder and redder
But all he produces is a splutter He gets a bit angry

SVEN

Thors blood

Svens dad looks heavenwards

SVENS DAD

Youre not using the right technique
Svens dad tries to take it over
SVEN

No Im doing it

They start to struggle

SVEN

(getting angry)

Youre always telling me TELLING me

Erik tries to separate them
ERIK

Sven

SVEN

(to his dad)

Let me do something for myself for a change
Suddenly Aud comes forward

AUD

No Dont quarrel

Sven and his dad stop fighting surprised by the vehement in her
voice

AUD
Well never get where we want to go if we fight

Aud crosses to the Horn and inserts the mouthpiece Loki glances
at Keitel He hadnt bargained for this

LOKI

Er dont blow it You never know WHAT might happen

AUD

It has not spoken for a thousand years You must bring it to life

with a kiss

She puts her lips to the mouthpiece and just touches it with
them almost a kiss then very gently she begins to blow
a soft slight note can just be heard Aud takes her mouth
away from the mouthpiece and the soft note goes on
reverberating A sweet note a magic note the Vikings stand
stock-still enchanted by the sound and the sound all the time
is getting louder and the Horn begins to vibrate with the note As
the volume increases the GOLDEN DRAGON itself begins to reverberate
with the sound Rings of ripples begin to radiate out from the
boat across the calm water The note grows louder and louder and
the Vikings who at first were laughing and cheering at Auds
success begin to get rather alarmed Louder and louder gets the
note and the Horn shakes and the boat vibrates Things start to
be shaken loose and fall onto the deck Ropes uncoil and run
loose A heavy block suddenly crashes down to the deck crowning
Harald and laying him out flat Louder and louder grows the note and
the Vikings have to stop their ears for the pain The water around
the ship becomes more and more agitated And then another sound is
heard It is the thunder of water in the distance like a million
distant waterfalls And suddenly they notice the sea is running like
a river - all in one direction sweeping the ship forward with
incredible momentum In no time they are engulfed in a mist still
travelling at a rate of knots Almost at once appointed rock looms out
of the mist ahead of them Erik flings himself at the steering oar
and everyone is thrown about as the ship veers wildly and just misses
the rock only to see another looming up ahead of them The ship

veers again as a third rock looms ahead This time Sven has grabbed
a coil of rope and as they pass the third rock he throws it like a
lasso over the rock Loki and Keitel leap to grab the rope just as
the rope goes taut and the ship comes to a lurching stop
anchored by the rope but still swaying and buffeted in the racing
waters Those on board shout to each other soaked to the skin It
is difficult to make out what they are shouting

LOKI
Help
AUD

What are you doing

What dyou think Help Somebody help us
SVEN
Shut up

LOKI

pointing at Aud)
She wants to kill us

KEITEL

She wants to take us over the Edge of the World
AUD
You want to get to Asgaard dont you

LOKI
How do we know this is the way

ERIK

(shouting)

We blew the Horn Resounding

LOKI

(screaming and pointing an accusing finger at Aud)
SHE blew the Horn

Resounding

KEITEL

(shouting)

Dont you see Erik She wants revenge

ERIK

What are you talking about

LOKI

(to Keitel)

Shut up

EITEL

She knows it was our fault

LOK

eep your mouth shut Keitel

EITEL
No Its YOU Loki I should never have listened to you

Loki looks around desperately

LOKI

Youve lost your mind
KEITEL

We came to stop you waking the Gods Erik But I didnt want anyone
to get hurt

LOKI
You fool

Suddenly Loki produces his stiletto and leaps onto Keitel stabbing
at him

LOK
I should have got rid of you long ago
KEITEL

Like you got rid of Snorri

Erik tries to separate them

AUD

No No We are in the spell of the Horn Hatred will destroy us
ERIK

Thats right

For a split second Erik is distracted He looks across at Aud and for
a moment he sees Freya standing there

FREYA
Once you are in the spell of the Horn hatred will destroy you

Then it is Aud once more But in that split second Loki has
stabbed Erik

ERI
Arrgh
Erik staggers back clutching his arm Keitel gives a roar of rage

and picks Loki up bodily and hurls him out of the boat into the
maelstrom The other Vikings look on aghast Keitel turns on them

KEITEL
He killed Snorri He caused the land of Hy-Brasil to sink SHE knew
AUD

I didnt know

KEITEL

Now she wants to send us over the Edge of the World

AUD

How else dyou think were going to get to Asgaard

The Vikings look at each other amidst the roaring waters and the
thick spray Erik holds his bleeding arm and looks at Aud Should
he trust her or not Suddenly he turns on the others

ERIK

(shouting above the din)

Do YOU know the way to Asgaard Keitel Blacksmith

Keitel shakes his head

ERIK

Do YOU know the way to Asgaard Sven

Sven shakes his head

ERIK

There is one road before us and that leads over the Edge of the
World

Harald sits up as he returns to consciousness
HARALD
There IS no Edge of the World

Svens dad bonks him again Erik takes the rope and begins paying
it out With grim faces the Vikings turn and face towards the
roaring of the waters as Erik edge the ship further into the mist
The noise is deafening It would be almost impossible to hear any
voice above it The faces of the Vikings betray their fear as
they find themselves emerging from out of the mist at the Edge of
the World They gape as they find themselves confronted by a

Waterfall of Seas - stretching on either side of them - as far as

the eye can see - water falling and plunging over the lip of the
world And in front of them - the blue sky continues on down and down
until it shades into blackness strewn with stars beneath their
feet Sven Svens dad and Keitel edge to the prow and gasp

AUD

No Dont look over the Edge

Erik lets out a little more rope until the ship is protruding over
the edge Sven his dad and Keitel peer over the side and stare down
into the abyss They gasp From above we see the prow of GOLDEN
DRAGON and the backs of the Vikings heads in plain view against a
backdrop of stars below them

ERIK

Let me see

Aud holds him back

AUD

No Dont look The abyss will suck away your strength

ERIK

I MUST look Keitel Hold this

Erik turns to see Sven and Keitel trembling They hold onto the
sides of the ship but their legs can barely support them

SVEN

There is nothing we can do
SVENS DAD

Helpless

Keitel start to laugh

KEITEL

Ha ha I believed Loki I believed I had a duty to
blacksmiths Ha ha ha
Keitel laughs a little hysterically Aud turns urgently to Erik
AUD

YOU still want to go to Asgaard

ERIK

Of course

AUD

Do you believe I love you

ERIK

I but I

AUD

You dont have to love me Just do you believe I love YOU

ERIK

Yes - I believe you do

AUD

Then let go

Erik hesitates then he decides to believe in Aud He throws the
rope away At once the ship shoots off over the Edge of the
World into space Everything seems to slow down as the longship
drops down and down the ship twists slowly as it drops
round and round The Vikings gaze about them in wonder as they find
their ship if falling in silence amongst the stars Harald comes to
once again

HARALD

Im still seeing stars

eitel looks round at him

EITEL

Were ALL seeing stars

HARALD
No I was hit on the head

The longship falls and falls through the star-strewn space until
it softly lands in a white wilderness On the deck the Vikings are
huddles up covered with rime-frost It seems as if they have been
lying there half-frozen for some time Perhaps the entire adventure
has all been a dream and they have been stuck in the Arctic pack-
ice the whole time The hallucinations of men near to death Aud
tries to wake Erik

AUD

Dont sleep wake Look

Erik opens his eyes and for an instant he sees Helga He blinks
and realizes it is Aud who is calling him back to consciousness
Suddenly coloured lights begin to play to his face

ERIK

Bi-Frost The Rainbow Bridge

Above them the Aurora Borealis stretches up magnificent and awesome
in the sky Erik makes his way through the other Vikings

ERIK
Wake up

The others slowly begin to rouse themselves from their icy slumber
and sit up awed by the sight

KEITEL

(whispering)

Are we dead

VIKINGS

The Rainbow Bridge

They all peer up at the ever-changing colours of the Aurora
Borealis hanging in the sky above them like organ-pipes But
something is happening The lights begin to fade to reveal a
magical city on a mountain The Vikings realize that this is

journeys end they have reached Asgaard the City of the Gods
The Vikings all catch their breaths and gaze in awe
ERIK

Asgaard

HARALD MISSIONARY
Where

SVENS DAD

Up there you fathead

HARALD MISSIONARY

Up WHERE

Harald look round quizzically at the others It
can see nothing

ERIK

Look Its real

Harald looks around at the others
HARALD

Hallucinations are real

Its no use Harald can see nothing The Vikings
rise to their

the sight of their fabled home of the Gods
feet Aud whispers to Erik

AUD

The second note

ERIK

The second not to wake the Gods
Erik kneels in front of the Horn
AUD

Gently

is clear that he

transfixed by

Erik blows a soft gentle note He takes his mouth away and

smiles at Aud Once again the Horn stars to

vibrate and the
note gets louder the ship starts to vibrate louder and louder

The whole landscape starts to vibrate louder and louder grows
the not until even the stars in the sky are vibrating and then a
magical thing starts to happen The note fades as one by one the
shimmering stars start to fall out of the night sky they fall
like silver snow until the ship the Vikings Asgaard the
whole landscape is covered in sparkling dust then in the ensuing
silence the first light begins to glow in the Halls of Asgaard
then another and another Erik stares as is bewitched and
slowly begins to climb out of GOLDEN DRAGON but Aud tries to pull
him back

AUD

Erik Youve done what you came to do

ERIK

Not quite

Aud looks at him

AUD

Blow the third note The note to take us home
ERIK

There is something I must ask the Gods

AUD

No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard The Gods
will never let you return

Erik looks at her for a moment But he knows he has no choice
SVEN

came to find my grandfather

ERIK

have to go

AUD

Then I shall come too
ERIK

(stares at her)

No no

AUD

I donT want to live WITHOUT you

ERIK

But Aud I I came to find someone

Aud is about to say Her but she bites the word back and looks
down at the ground

ERIK
Im sorry Aud I really am

Aud kisses Erik who then turns and climbs out of GOLDEN DRAGON and
sets off across the ice Sven follows

SVENS DAD

Wait for me Ill be dead soon anyway

KEITEL

You cant go without me

They follow Even Harald Missionary starts to follow
HARALD

Where are they all going

AUD

Arent you afraid

HARALD

Oh Theres nothing for ME to be afraid OF

Harald smiles and sets off after the others Aud follows The

stars have fallen to forma shining winding pathway up to the City
of the Gods This is what the Vikings head for Between them and the
Citadel strange huge forms rise up The Vikings approach and find
the vast skeletons of the slain giants The Vikings are but tiny
gnat-sized figures wending their way between the vast figures
They climb the stairway-path of stars up the winding road
and eventually fins themselves outside the massive doors of Asgaard
ERIK

Valhalla

Sven turns on Harald

SVEN

There Its real Its solid Now do you believe us

He pats the wall of Valhalla - the Great Hall Harald reaches out
but his hand goes right through the wall

HARALD

There isnt anything

Harald Missionary walks straight through the wall and disappears
from sight The Vikings gasp and run up to feel the point

where he disappeared The door is perfectly solid to them and they
jump pout of their skins as Harald suddenly reappears again

HARALD

Youre having me on arent you

ERIK

Its Valhalla - where the warriors slain in battle go

AUD

It doesnt exist for him

SVENS DAD

Hes just s cynic

At this moment there is a creak and the great doors mysteriously
swing open As if mesmerized the Vikings enter the Halls of
Asgaard The door slams behind them They spin round but the doors

have vanished No man has ever entered the Halls of Asgaard and left
alive Erik slowly starts to cross the vast floor looking around
him as he does so One by one the other Vikings follow After a while
Erik stops

ERIK

Listen

The Vikings listen They hear the sound of children laughing
and shouting Erik and his men follow through the columns towards a
pool of light The scene that greets their eyes is not at all what
they had been prepared for Valhalla is not full of the warriors
slain in battle quaffing mead on the ale-bench and reliving old
battles - it is instead full of children romping laughing
shouting quarrelling and playing games chess fencing dice
tag etc around a wide hearth fire Women are cooking and doing
other housewifely things weaving making bread etc It is a
thoroughly domestic scene Suddenly one of them turns at Erik It

is Helga whom Erik accidentally killed in Scene One She is once
again kneading dough She has a red stain under her breast

HELGA

Oh good Its Mr Wonderful

Erik leaps to her side

ERIK

Ive come to take you back to the land of the living
HELGA

What a stupid idea

ERIK

(mortally hurt)

Why

HELGA

Whats the point of being dead in the land of the living
ERIK

Ill ask the Gods to give you life again
Helga looks at Erik very sceptically She obviously thinks he
doesnt know what hes talking about Aud reacts Erik takes Helgas
hand - and gets covered in dough

HELGA

Have you tried to ask the God for anything

ERIK

Well no

HARALD MISSIONARY

Who is he talking to

AUD

Sh

HELGA

Odin

One of the children throwing pennies against the wall looks round
CHILD ODIN

Im busy

The Vikings are recovering from their surprise
VIKINGS

Odin

HELGA

(getting back to her kneating)

Hes busy

ERIK

Is THAT Odin

HELGA

Youll have to wait till hes finished his game
ERIK

(shouting across)

Odin

Odin leaves his game and saunters towards Erik
ERIK

We have come from the world of Midgard

The child whom Odin is playing with points his hammer at the
ground near Erik and a lightning bolt zaps into it Erik jumps

CHILD-THOR

Clear off

ODIN

No wait Thor
ERIK

You must help us
ODIN

We dont HAVE to help anybody

ERIK

Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun - men fight and kill each other
the whole time

ODIN

Why should WE care

ERIK

Because youre youre the Gods

ODIN

So
ERIK

Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and
bloodshed Harald looks around at the Vikings in increasing
desperation

HARALD

This is ridiculous

VIKINGS

Sh

HARALD

Right

The other Child-Gods have stopped playing around now and are watching
Erik and Odin

ODIN

Erik the Viking The things you seek are not in our power We dont
make men love each other or hate each other

ER

But youre the Gods

ODIN
Look Erik

Odin whistles The other children look over their shoulders From
out of the darkness of the perimeter of the Hall shadows emerge
shadows that as they shuffle and stumble into the light reveal
themselves to be the heroes that the Vikings had expected to find
in Valhalla But they are not hale and hearty giants quaffing mead
and reliving their great battles they are in fact a sorry lot
the slain-in-battle still bearing the hideous deformities of their
fatal wounds Most have a sword or an axe buried in some part of
their anatomy One has been cleft in twain The Vikings react to
this grisly gathering as more and more of them emerge from the
shadows They gasp as they notice Snorri Ivar Thorfinn Loki
and Leif the Lucky

ERIK
Snorri Ivar
HARALD
Here we are standing on a bare mountain top talking to thin air

We notice that Haralds cloak is being blown about as if he were
indeed on a bare mountain top The others cloaks are still
Svens dad is gazing across at one horribly mutilated specimen

SVENS DAD

Dad

KEITEL

(disbelievingly)

How can you tell

SVENS DAD

Ill never forget him The BASTARD

Sven reacts Svens dad starts to go berserk
SVENS DAD

He drove me mad

SVEN
Easy Dad
SVENS DAD

All his youll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper
SVEN

Dad

SVENS DAD

I hate you I hate you

Svens dad collapses against Sven and Sven comforts

him understandingly A figure emerges from the throng of dead
It is Thorfinn Sven looks up at him
THORFINN

You won Sven

LOKI

What right have YOU to try and stop men fighting Erik the
Viking There is glory in battle There are riches to be made and
won

KEITEL

Made by YOU Loki

LOKI

By YOU - Keitel Blacksmith Dont you know Erik that is why he
went with you Ragnarok was good for his business

KEITEL

Its not my business any more

Suddenly there is a howl a bitter howl that echoes above and
around the Halls of Asgaard and that gets more distant and more
distant Everyone (including the dead heroes and the Gods) freezes and
looks up listening Perhaps we cut away to the boiling sky as it
resolves itself into the shape of a wolf that snarls and slinks
away Odin turns to Erik as the howling recedes

ODIN

Fenrir the Wolf has gone Erik But will men cease fighting each
other THAT is not in our power

Odin starts to laugh All the other children start to laugh so
do the dead heroes Erik and his men look round uneasily

ERIK

I have one more request before we return

Erik turns towards Helga who is still standing at her trough of
dough with her arms up to her elbows in flour Aud watches Erik with
sadness in her heart

ODIN

Return You have set your foot in the Halls of Asgaard Erik
You cannot return

Aud looks round to see how the others react It is as she had
feared Erik pales The blood drains from the others faces Aud
whispers something to Harald Harald looks at her blankly

AUD

(whispering)

PLEASE

HARALD

But youre all imagining this whatever it is
AUD

(earnestly)

Youre the only one who can PLEASE

Harald look around at the dumbfounded Vikings Then he shrugs
and wanders off disappearing through the closed doors of Valhalla

ERIK

You mean we must stay here forever

As he says this Eriks eyes turn again towards Helga He is
clearly thinking at least there are compensations Odin however is
laughing again

ODIN

Stay HERE Ha ha This is Valhalla This is reserved for those slain-
in-battle

HORRIBLY SLAIN WARRIOR
(grinning cheerfully)

Yeah Were the LUCKY ones

A HORRIBLY SLAIN FRIEND OF HIS

Yeah Its much better than dying of old age
The ghastly and dismembered dead warriors all chortle no end at
the dismay written on the face of Erik and his men At the same time
there is a grinding winching sound All those around the hearth-
place fall back as a vast grating is winched up from out of the
flames The Vikings look at each other

ODIN
For YOU there is only the Pit of Hel

As Odin says this there is a roaring sound and the flames and smoke
are suddenly reversed and as the roaring increases the flames are
sucked down altogether to reveal the black Pit of Hel itself And now

the Pit is sucking the Vikings into it their hair blows
they try to withstand the force that is drawing them towards the
abyss The Gods look on in some amusement But some of the dead are
concerned

SVENS GRANDFATHER
Son My son
SVENS DAD

Get lost

SVEN

Dad Grandfather

Sven tries to reconcile his father and grandfather but its no use
He is sucked towards the Pit

VIKINGS

Help

ERIK

(to Helga)

I tried to save you
HELGA

Why should you care

ERIK
I dont know I just did

Erik can no longer withstand the force that is sucking him down to
the Pit of Hel Suddenly however Snorri has leapt from the ranks
of the dead He grabs Erik and tries to stop him sliding towards
the Pit of Hel But its no good

ERIK

No Let go Snorri

SNORRI

Ive got you

ERIK

Youll be sucked down too

SNORRI

No Arrgh

Meanwhile Ivar and Thorfinn and Leif the Lucky have also leapt
forward to save their comrades They put up a fantastic
struggle but remorselessly they are all sucked down

VIKINGS

Aagh

The Vikings clutch at the stone floor their fingers trace blood
as they try to cling on but to no avail The first are already
toppling into the Pit

VIKINGS

Noooh

VIKINGS

Ah

And the rest - including Aud - soon follow The mouth of the Pit of
Hel through which the Vikings are now tumbling higgledy-piggledy is
a round white disc set in the unutterable blackness of the pit
However as the Vikings free-fall slowly towards camera they are lit

up by a faint reddish glow from below They are staring wild-eyed
and screaming as they fall As they fall Erik manages to smash
his axe into the side of the Pit Thorfinn grabs his leg and holds
onto Svens foot Leif clutches at Svens belt Svens dad hangs
onto Svens foot Ivar clutches Thorfinns foot Erik clutches
Ivars leg and Aud clutches Eriks They dangle like this for some
seconds and look fearfully beneath them Then they can see the
Infernal Regions of flame and molten lava somehow suggesting
the face of a huge and sinister creature No wonder theyre scared
out of their wits Meanwhile Odin and Thor appear at the top of
the Pit and look down with mild amusement Thor casually points his
hammer and a streak of lightning zaps Eriks axe It instantly glows
red hot Erik screams Suddenly we hear a new sound - a long high
sweet note

AUD
Listen LISTEN The third note

But its no good Erik has to let go of the red-hot axe
Everyone screams as they start to plunge down towards the Pit of Hel
Cut to GOLDEN DRAGON Harald Missionary is blowing the Horn
Resounding

HARALD MISSIONARY
(to himself)
I want to go home Oooh

Suddenly GOLDEN DRAGON the Horn Resounding and Harald Missionary
shoot up into the air and disappear from sight Cut back to the Pit of
Hel The Vikings are looking down as they fall - they are still
scared but gradually start laughing laughing as they fall down
and down and down until they fall out of sight We are left witha
blackness and just the white disc of the mouth of the Pit of Hel
above until the disc changes magically into the moon There is a
series of splashes The note begins to fade and the camera slowly
pans down to reveal the Vikings all fallen into the duck pond back
at Ravensfjord They are laughing and whooping and splashing each
other

ERIK

I dont believe it Ha ha ha It brought us HOME
LEIF

But who BLEW it

IVAR
Oh Who cares Were HOME

THORFINN

Mum Dad

SVEN

Were back

Sven embraces his father and dances him around with joy
ALL

Yo hoo Were here Were

Suddenly the joy drains from their faces and they each gape in
horror What is it they see We cut to see that out of the huts’ the
women and children and old men are emerging - but they are anything
but happy In fact they are all bound and gagged Behind them emerge
the sinister figures of Halfdan the Black Gisli and maybe half a
dozen armed men Halfdan and his cronies no longer look sleek and
self-assured They are haggard and desperate Their faces are
streaked with dirt and sweat and their clothes are torn and
soiled They have clearly been going through a lean time since
Ragnarok ended and have descended on the village for revenge and for
whatever plunder they can find They have a few sackfuls of
booty with them They herd the women children and old men into a
pathetic huddle in the middle of the village Halfdan is
spitting evil and hatred

HALFDAN

Throw down your weapons - or we shoot the children first

Erik hesitates The others look at him What choice have
they Reluctantly Erik throws his weapons into the pond The others

follow suit Halfdan watches His men stand around him in a tight
group with their backs to each other

HALFDAN

Good Good Right now well just shoot the children
anyway

Erik is paralysed What can they do Half Halfdans men are
aiming their crossbows at Erik and his comrades and half are
aiming at the women and children They raise the crossbows to
shoot Their fingers tighten on the triggers Suddenly there is a
scream from above
HARALD

Look out below

Everyone looks up and amazingly out of the sky falls GOLDEN
DRAGON and lands fair and square on top of Halfdan and his gang
squashing them flat Harald Missionary staggers blearily from the
wreckage

GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE

Harald

She rushes to Harald while the Vikings rush to release their
loved ones Great celebrations all round

VAR
Look

They all turn and see the sun rising The villagers gasp in
wonder Theyve never seen the sun before Erik looks around and sees
Thorfinn and Sven with their arms round each other Aud looks up as
Erik smiles at he and holds her to him Then they all turn and
gaze at the spectacle of the sun returning to the world
