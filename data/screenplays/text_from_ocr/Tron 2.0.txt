somebody - some hacker some

competitor somebody
theyre smarter than

into X-Net is theoretically

impossible

And the world assumes weve got a
faulty product And theyd be right

We ramp up our encryption schemes -

Thicken all

PHLEGMAN

RUSH

We cant win playing defense And
its a bigger job than just swatting

an intruder

program Somewhere

theres a human mind behind this
thing We have to get to that User
and shut him - or her - down or the
game never ends

Meg listens quietly

What do you

20 guys for

Studies Rush

SINCLAIR
need Rush

RUSH
20 days -

SINCLAIR

We dont have 20 hours This problem

needs to be

gone before tomorrow

9AM Come on people this companys
future is at stake Its time to
think without a box

Minds ponder grimly
the company Archivist

Finally a lone VP rises Its RUDY

RUDY

At a time like this lets seek

inspiration

in the past We should

ask ourselves What solution would

spring from

the inspired mind of our

departed leader Flynn

( )

TRON 20 Jefferies 12

Hes got an obituary photo of FLYNN Encoms legendary
previous - and deceased - CEO

Groans around the table Execs rolls their eyes disses
Rudys idea Flynn has become a stale company joke

Rudy sheepishly sits

But Sinclair stops behind Rudy eyes fixed on the photo of
Flynn An idea takes hold He looks to Meg

SINCLAIR
Is the QF-401 is operational
MEG
Um Midway into phase one testing

Confusion among execs Nobody knows what a QF-401 is
Not even Rush

SINCLAIR
If we cant fight this intruder from
the outside then maybe we need to
fight him from the inside
Megs mind races

MEG
Im ready to do my part

SINCLAIR
This company needs a hero Who among
you is the smartest most resourceful
and courageous

Looks trade around the table Meg slowly rises indicating
her choice

MEG
Who else could it be

Shes singled out Rush

Somebody going to tell me what Ive
been volunteered for

TRON 20 Jefferies 13

SINCLAIR
Rush youre the only one I can trust
to eliminate the intruder But you
wont be doing it the way you thought
Megs been working on something down
here thats well Beyond Top
Secret

Rush drills a look at Meg but she keeps it all business

INT ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER

Out the elevator Meg leads them into a maze of ultra-tech
gear

MEG
This is where Flynn worked And
where he died

Amid sleek new equipment theres a glass cabinet housing a
CHARRED REMNANT of strange machinery

SINCLAIR
Meg has reconstructed Flynns last
project This time it works

Mega signals lab assistant DEWEY He pokes buttons A
MASSIVE TECHNICAL DEVICE unfolds and boots up

RUSH
You didnt pick this up at Circuit
City What is it

MEG
A Quantum Digitizer Prototype
only one of its kind Flynn designed
it to break down physical objects
into high resolution data Luckily
we salvaged his key components and
back-engineered the system

She opens a cage places her LAB RAT (Jo-Jo) on a target
stage Dewey boots controls presses commands Beam array
scans the rat into the computer forming a 3D rat-image on
screens dematerializing the physical rat Device revs down
Rush runs his hand over the empty target stage

RUSH
Thats Not possible

Lab rat has vanished from the physical world Its digitized
image rotates on monitors

TRON 20 Jefferies 14

MEG
Flynn was trying to take it one step
further He wanted to transport a
human being into cyberspace

RUSH
You mean the urban legends A
computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace
a long time ago

SINCLAIR
We think it happened

Meg agrees Rush gets a chill

SINCLAIR
It was a fluke But Flynn worked
for years down here trying to make
it happen again One day a test
went bad A plasma reaction destroyed
this lab Flynn was reduced to ash

Rush views the charred remains in the glass case Photos of
the destroyed lab Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene

RUSH

I was never told how he died It
was all just weird you know because
Flynns the guy who hired me But
he was strange kept to himself I
didnt know what job I was supposed
to be doing

(to Sinclair)
Then you came onboard the company
woke up we had a direction It was
kind of pathetic because by the
time Flynn died everybody was too
busy to care

SINCLAIR
He was brilliant in his way but
genius without discipline leads to
nothing His reckless habits nearly
ruined this company And for sure
got him killed

A last look at the charred remains of Flynns machine

MEG
That kind of accident cant happen
again Weve upgraded the system in
ways Flynn never could The chips
didnt exist until now

TRON 20 Jefferies

She presses commands Beams re-materialize the lab rat on
the target stage Jo-jo is as good as new

MEG
Hey Jo-Jo Have good trip

She puts the rat in on her shoulder feeds it a tidbit
Then she scrutinizes Rush

Rush considers Meg then turns to Sinclair

RUSH
You want her to send me into
cyberspace to catch that jerk who
hacked us

SINCLAIR
The future of this company depends
on it

Rush looks to Meg She offers a reassuring nod

RUSH
You can bring me back okay

MEG
Ask Jo-Jo

Lab rat is perched happily on her shoulder

SINCLAIR
Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow
Rush I know if anyone can its
you Ive had my eye on you for a
long time Score this hit and Ill
make you my full partner in this
company

Rush is awe-struck Ready willing able He shakes
Sinclairs hand sealing the deal

RUSH
I wont let you down Lets do it

Meg removes target stage swings a custom TARGET CHAIR in
place Rush lowers in place Meg buckles him in Last
chance for a private word

MEG
I promise Ill get you back safely
by 9AM tomorrow But you have to
promise me something too -

Youre a piece of work You dumped
me because you said I was too much
about the companys needs and not
enough about yours Well here we
are the company needs their best
guy and you just cant admit how
much to hurts to nominate me

MEG
This bigger than us Rush Listen
to me I dont know what youre
going to find in there but whatever
it is promise youll follow your
heart and do the right thing
Rush stares at here in shock

RUSH
Oh So you think I have a heart

Meg breaks away retreating to the controls with Sinclair
Rushs trails her with his eyes - he cant stop looking

Its YOU The intruder

Rushs body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his
feet across floor circuitry up to the plateau Energy
interacts with Trons body circuits siphoning off bits of

know the program they used to call
Tron

Plexor activates memory banks Accesses archive files of
the original low-rez Tron So harmless so many years ago
Bears little resemblance to the upgraded Tron

PLEXOR
You are in error Zero match

RUSH
Exactly Thats how hes getting
past you You dont see him for
what he is Hes one of your own

program from Encoms old days
Strictly low-rez right Archived
and forgotten But his source code
contains all the architecture of
every Encom system including X-net

This is a waste of X-Net resources

You cant doubt his instructions
right

Of course not But I am programmed

Who is this guy

Rush pulls Krod aside

RUSH
Miles - I mean Krod you flew the

hotshot lightcycle rider The red
guy Remember

KROD
Well Eh Id like to help you
but truth is I just got rebooted
from a big crash Theres nothing
left in my memory from before

Remember Krod You were watching
this lightcycle duel a red guy and
a green guy head-to-head

Krod gawks at the image but hes stumped

RUSH
The green guy faked out the red guy
but the red guy double-faked the

Bingo

KROD
Okay YES And the green guy
splattered big time It was awesome
How could I forget that

Splat happens in Rushs memory image All goes white

Where did the red guy go after that
You didnt crash right away

(to Rush)
I hired Sinclair as Encoms business
guy so I could do the dreaming
Right off he wanted to capture the
market on data transmission Had
this plan called X-Net based on
flawless efficiency hyperlock
security encryption protocol
uniformity Blah blah I was the
boss I told him to forget it I
knew it could go bad But the guy
had trouble taking no for an answer
He arranged for my lab to melt down
Sinclair took over my company and
put X-Net on a fast-track And heres
where its brought us

City descends into panic X-Takk Troops evict Programs
seize prisoners and mercilessly hunt down resistors

X-Net Construction Crews build the Optik Highway with
relentless precision blasting aside the old citys splendid

attack me doesnt he

MEGA
Yes And Rush will fight by his
side

PLEXOR
Where will they strike

MEGA
Flynn does not decide until the hour
of his attack But he trusts me
completely When he knows the place
I will know it as well

PLEXOR
Perfect They will be met with a
final thrashing Yes let them come

They pass through the gate arrive in the corridor

MEGA
Have you further instructions for
me

PLEXOR
None for now But stay close

They lock gazes Barcode data surges between them

PLEXOR
You came to me full of glitches and

created X-Net to the same standard
of flawless beauty Soon its
perfection will become all that is
and all that ever will be

Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down
his body but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN
He step away shakes off the damage retrieves his disk into
a hand

Jams hologon into its receptacle

Plexor cocks his death disk EYES FLASH ELECTRO-PSYCHOSIS -
Hologon REACTS with CENTRAL CELL -

Shockwaves RADIATE -

Energy rings go dim then dark -

Silicon shatters to ash -

X-Takks power down X-Net armor de-rezzes leaving innocent
civilian Programs They shake off the mind-control and rise
unshackled

And Plexor like all things X-Net chatters and glitches
His code erodes his bits darken the fiber of his being

erodes from inside

MEGA
Now whos obsolete

Rush executes a final leap extending his feet for the final
blow straight at Plexor - CRASH - shattering him to bits

Rush finally breathes Sees I-beem Krod Quantz Boole
