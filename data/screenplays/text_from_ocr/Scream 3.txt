BEN
Reaction to what

Ben passes under the huge pallid H in the sign What seems at first
like a

gentle raindrop beads down Bens forehead He rolls back his head
his legs

turning to jelly his eyes widening in horror

BEN
OHMYGOD NO
CHRISTINE --
Has been gutted from neck to groin She has been fastened to the
cross-bar in

the H with heavy rope Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the
Southern California wind Utterly horrified Ben staggers into the
shadows

not seeing --

THE GHOST as he rises from the void knife in hand In one quick
brutal

stab the knife is driven into Bens spine Ben screams as hes turned
around

face to face with his attacker

BEN
(screaming)
BUT IM THE KILLER IN STAB 3

THE GHOST
You just lost the role Ben
Consider this your parting gift

AND WITH that the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Bens
heart
causing a vicious eruption of crimson

ROMAN

(addressing audience)

or Tori or David not returning to complete
the STAB trilogy have no fear Roman is
here Aided with my excellent cast of
newcomers I believe were going to pull
off one of the best Stabs yet

GALE

ROMAN

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd Roman appears somewhat sinister
in this
light Gale gazes deeply into Romans eyes

GALE
Your life
ROMAN
Well if you were in my shoes dealing with
those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like
I do on a daily basis youd watch how quick
your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to
a Tobe Hooper flick

Roman smiles The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience
break into

applause Gale somewhat distracted other what not caring what this
second

rate director has to say gazes at a costumed individual at the far
corner of

the set watching from a half-open exit door Now it could be just her
imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost
appears as

if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming
blade

A LOUD BUZZING OS Gale is startled out of her skin She looks up at
a sign

hanging over the stage THE WORD COMMERCIAL BREAK is illuminated in

flashing

red light Gale sighs looks back to the exit The GHOST is gone She

turns to

Roman

Jennifer

with Brad Pitt but being single thats a pretty
good fall back

Jennifer

producers The elder sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE a towering
hefty man

with gray hair The second bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON a
creepy

fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor The two
talk

ignoring Gale the entire time Shes almost eavesdropping on their
conversation

MILTON
I can assure you that security on the set
will be at an all time high Again the
deaths are sheer tragedy

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Well Id hate to see the production shut down
(laughs)

I myself am a big STAB fan
BUDDY
Really

(smiles)
Have you ever thought about acting
Youve got just the right face

DETECTIVE KINCAID
I am kind of dedicated to my job
Although I do enjoy taking acting
classes on my weekends I grew up
around these studios anyway I know
my way around My Uncle was a screenwriter
for PARAMOUNT

MILTON
Really what was his name

Before Kincaid can finish Gale buts in

GALE
Excuse me Detective I think we have some
business to attend to

MILTON
(flabbergasted)
GALE WEATHERS What are you doing here
No press on the set
(to security)
No press no press on set
Get that woman out of here

SECURITY GAURD
(approaching)
Yes Mr Milton

DETECTIVE KINCAID
No Mr Milton Miss Weathers is with me

Milton nods his head flags down the guard He walks away

MILTON
Well then I guess Ill be leaving then

GALE
Oh come on Why the hostility

MILTON
Listen Lois Lane I love your show and
all but last month I happened to catch
your little segment on me and how my wife
left me because Im a sex addict who
enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls
It was a real eye opener my lawyers are
still thinking about bringing to your
superiors attentions

GALE
(shit-eating smile on her face)
Theyre the ones who approved it

Milton storms off camera Buddy following close behind Gale looks up
at
Kincaid

GALE
Alright Kincaid no where to

DETECTIVE KINCAID
I go to the police station and do my job
and you go back to being Gale Weathers

GALE
Oh I thought you wanted me to stick around

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Whoever it is now is taking credit
for Maureen Prescotts murder

GALE
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott
Billy Loomis and Stu Macher I mean they
even told Sidney how they did it

DETECTIVE KINCAID
Yeah but if Im not mistaken you said in
your book that Sidney got it wrong before
She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother
and he was sent away for it Maybe there is a
third killer Sidney Might know something

Kincaids eyes appear as if questioning Dewey

DEWEY
I told you I dont know where Sidney is
And even if there was a third killer
Sidney doesnt know about it

DETECTIVE KINCAID
That is for me to decide I need to talk to her Mr

Riley
she is a key element in this case I have a press
conference
in an hour and I need to explain why there are four
dead
celebrities
GALE

Four There are five

DETECTIVE KINCAID
Ben Damon Christine Perkins Sarah Darling
Tom Prinze Thats four last time I learned

Could be days before we find her that is
if shes even there

Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this He
smirks ever

so nefariously at Dewey

GALE
OK look We all know that this has something to
do with Stab 3 What we do not know is why the
killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott

WE ARE
INT TRAILER - STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney Gale Karen and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the
small
cramped trailer watching the tape

SIDNEY
Oh MY god

RANDY
Well if youre watching this tape it means
as I feared I did not survive these killings
here at Windsor College Anyway the reason
I am here is to help you so that my death
will not be in vain That my lifes work will
help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated
If this killer does come back and hes for real
there are a few things that you gotta remember
Is this simply another sequel Well if it is same
rules apply But heres the critical thing If you
find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory
and a preponderance of exposition then the sequel
rules do not apply Because you are not dealing

revealed

So

gonna be

him

can

NUMBER

off

rules

CUT TO

with a sequel you are dealing with the concluding
chapter of a trilogy

DEWEY
A trilogy

RANDY
Thats right Its a rarity in the horror field
but it does exist and its a force to be reckoned
with because true trilogies are all about going back
to the beginning and discovering something that wasnt
true from the get go Godfather Jedi all

something that we thought was true that wasnt true

if it is a trilogy you are dealing with here are some
super trilogy rules One you got a killer whos

super human Stabbing him wont work shooting him
wont work basically in the third one you gotta
cryogenically freeze his head decapitate him or blow

up Number two anyone including the main character

die This means you Sid Im sorry its the final
chapter It can be fuckin Reservoir Dogs by the
time this thing is through Number three the past
will come back to bite you in the ass Whatever you
think you know about the past forget it The past is
not at rest any sins you think were committed in

the past are about to break out and destroy you

FOURNever ever under any circumstances go running

by yourself cause if Friday the 13th has taught us
anything its that the next time were gonna see you
youre gonna have a fence post jutting out from your
back So in closing let me say good luck God Speed
and for some of you Ill see you soon cause the

say some of you aint gonna make it I didnt not
if youre watching this tape
