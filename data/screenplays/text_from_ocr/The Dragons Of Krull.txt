DAWN

EXT FOREST - JUST BEFOR

ail-clad HORSEMEN gallop headlong through the dark bent
low over their saddles A bestial scream is heard and
suddenly a saddle is empty the rider sprawled face down
in

a pool of blood

At the head of the band COLWYN a boy of twenty-two

raises

his shield to ward off an unseen assailant We hear a

horrendous tearing sound and Colwyns father TUROLD
riding beside him looks over at the boy Colwyn is

unharmed

- but his shield is deeply gouged as if by a huge claw

E CASTLE - DAY

Turold and Rowan walk down the corridor followed by
Colwyn
and the Councilor

ROWAN
I tried to reach Ynyr the old one
I led a hundred men to his place in
Granite Needle but it was
surrounded The Dark Ones guard it
by night and by day they call out
the Slayers Ynyr cannot get out and
no one can get in

TUROLD
How many did you lose

ROWAN
Sixty at the needle another thirty
in the forest Only ten of us made
it back

TUROLD
We will have to try again His
knowledge is great Without it we
cannot hope to win

INT QUEENS BEDROOM - DAY

The QUEEN is propped up in bed eyes closed head tilted
back Her crown a jeweled tiara rests in her lap She
is

attended by two GIRLS-IN-WAITING one of whom sponges her
forehead with a damp cloth The Queen opens her eyes as
the

elderly Councilor enters

COUNCILOR
Lord Turold and his son my lady

The Queen hands her tiara to one of the girls-in-waiting
who places it on her head Then she nods and the
Councilor

admits Turold and Colwyn followed by Rowan The three
kneel

QUEEN
He has turned out well

Turold stands and looks down at Colwyn with an
affectionate
smile

TUROLD
Middling well

Colwyn stands and we see that he is several inches taller
than his father

TUROLD
Though a touch too tall for my
taste

Colwyn smiles somewhat sheepishly

QUEEN
(to Colwyn)
My daughter is in the north tower
Go to her

COLWYN
(flustered)
In my armor

QUEEN

EXT GLOOMY FOREST ROAD - DAY

Two mounted SLAYERS ride along the road

Their horses and

armor are black as are their cylindrical flat-topped
helmets pierced with a T-slot for vision Their weapons

are
long-swords and maces
Two more Slayers ride out of the forest and join the
black

column At a road up ahead wait three more who swing in
behind the column as it passes

Forest noises die at the Slayers approach the only
sounds

we hear are the clink of metal and the heavy thud of the
horses hooves

INT TOWER STAIRCASE - DAY

Colwyn mounts a narrow circular staircase toward a
wooden
door

INT TOWER ROOM - INTERCUT

LYSSA the Queens seventeen-year-old daughter stares
across the circular room at the wooden door listening to
Colwyns approaching footsteps

The door swings open and Colwyn enters They stare at
each

other for several moments Colwyn dusty and disheveled
in

his armor Lyssa freshly scrubbed and glowing ina
diaphanous gown

COLWYN
(nervous)
Im Colwyn

Lyssa nods noncommittal They start to circle the room
yes fixed on each other like a pair of nervous cats

COLWYN
(plaintive)
Are you Lyssa

She gives him another noncommittal nod They resume their
tentative circling

Suddenly Lyssa turns away leaning on the sill of a
narrow

window Her shoulders begin to heave as if shes
sobbing

Colwyn is in agony he rushes across the room to her

COLWYN
I dont care what arrangements were
made by our parents You dont have
to go through with it

Lyssa continues to heave

COLWYN
They cant force you I wont let
them

Lyssa turns around and Colwyn sees that shes not
sobbing
but laughing

LYSSA
(trying to control her
laughter)
Im sorry I couldnt help it

COLWYN
(taking considerable umbrage)
I dont have to go through with it

either
LYSSA
(still laughing touches his
arm)

You dont understand Im just so
relieved I was sure youd turn out
to be short and fat and gimpy

COLWYN
Oh That
(begins to chuckle)
I know what you mean
(sits down on a bench)
I had nightmares all week

LYSSA
(sits down beside him)
Me too
COLWYN

Last night was the worst I dreamt
you had one leg shorter than the
other and walked like a penguin

LYSSA
Mine was worse I dreamt you picked
your nose in public

COLWYN
Thats worse

LYSSA
Youre really not bad looking
Almost handsome

COLWYN
Well youre beautiful

LYSSA
You might be handsome I cant tell
through all that grime Besides you
reek of sweat and horses

COLWYN
(pompously)
If youre going to marry a warrior
youd best get used to it

LYSSA
I have no intention of getting used
to it
She goes over to a small cistern and fills a wooden
bucket

LYSSA
Take off your clothes Im going to
scrub you down

COLWYN
(aghast)
What

LYSSA
Were almost married

COLWYN
Were not married yet

LYSSA
Well then you can go up to the
parapet and Ill hand the buckets up
to you

Colwyn looks at the stone stairs leading to the top of
the
tower

COLWYN
Do I have to
(looks at Lyssa sighs)
I have to

He starts up the stairs

EXT ROAD CROSSING - DAY

A column of mounted Slayers waits at the crossing for
another column to reach the intersection The first
column

falls in beside the second as it passes forming a double
column

Farther down the road waits LORD MODRED a Slayer like
the

others but distinguished by the leopard embroidered on
his

chest and by his lance which bears a pennon affixed to
its

head ermine a leopard courant sable As the double
column

reaches him he wheels and leads them down the road
lance

upright

ENS BEDROOM - DAY

INT QU

Turold and Rowan at the Queens bedsid

QUEEN
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssas
godfathers He will defend her in
the ceremony I wish that Lord
Modred were here He is a godfather
of her own blood

TUROLD
odred has treated with the Dark
Ones

ROWAN

odred Impossible

TUROLD
He leads a group of Slayers under
the leopard banner

QUEEN
For some the lure of power is
stronger than the ties of blood No
matter I had hoped to have the
wedding next spring Lord Turold
with all the nobles of the kingdom
in attendance But Fate and this war
have ordained otherwise

TUROLD

It is important to assure the
succession

QUE EN
Yes

The Queen smiles and beckons Turold closer He kneels
beside
the bed

QUEEN
I will tell you something you did
not know Turold Had it been my
choice all those years ago I would
have chosen you for my king But my
parents chose otherwise

TUROLD
I knew

QUEEN
You knew You are a rude bumpkin

TUROLD
(smiles)
That I am my lady

Turold looks out the window at the North Tower

TUROLD
And it seems so is my son

POV - NORTH TOWER - INTERCUT

Angle from the Queens bedroom window A waist-high wall
conceals the bottom half of a naked Colwyn who stands
atop

the tower hugging himself in the brisk wind

EXT TOP OF NORTH TOWER - INTERCUT

Colwyn hears Lyssa mounting the stairs and moves to the
doorway reaching around to take the bucket from her

COLWYN
(as Lyssa pushes past him)
Just hand me the bucket What are
you doing

He backs away covering himself with his hands Lyssa
advances on him tucked in her belt like a sword is a
long-handled bath brush

LYSSA
I dont trust you to wash behind
your ears

COLWYN
Never mind my ears Go away

The Queen and Turold watch the unfolding drama from their
window vantage point a great tongue of water leaps
across

the tower as Lyssa heaves the bucketful at Colwyn
Dripping

wet he retreats but is soon cornered and attacked
without

quarter Lyssa wielding brush and soap with gleeful
enthusiasm At one point Colwyn squirms free and with
his

head completely enveloped in lather tries to flee But
since he cant see he soon fetches up against a wall
and

Lyssa continues her scrubbing

RESUME - QU

ENS BEDROOM

TUROLD
A girl of some spirit your
daughter

QUEEN

A match for your son I think

TUROLD
A fine match

QUEEN
(takes his hand)
They will have the life that you and
I might have had

EXT TOP OF NORTH TOWER - DAY

Wrapped in a long blue cape a scrubbed and scowling
Colwyn

stands with arms folded across his chest Lyssa is
combing

his hair

LYSSA
(steps back)
There Now you look like someone I
might want to marry

COLWYN
(surly growl)
Maybe youd better look around for
another candidate I dont think my
skin is tough enough to survive a
lifetime of you and your brush

LYSSA
I dont have to look around Ive
found the husband I want You can
kiss me now

COLWYN
Thank you but I can wait

LYSSA
I cant

She bestows a class-A smack
COLWYN
I lied

LYSSA
About what

COLWYN
I cant wait either

They close in a passionate kiss and begin caressing each
other We see Turold standing in the doorway watching
them

TUROLD
Youll both wait At least for five
hours The wedding is at three

COLWYN
(acting offended)
It was a platonic kiss Father

TUROLD
Of course it was

Turold snorts down a laugh Colwyn and Lyssa begin to
giggle Then all three break into laughter

EXT COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY

The occupants of the castle - servants soldiers minor
nobles and retainers - stand in two parallel lines
forming

an aisle

Turold and Rowan on horseback face each other at
opposite

ends of the aisle Midway between them stand Colwyn and
Lyssa side by side Colwyn facing Rowan Lyssa facing
Turold The two fathers are not armored but they hold
longswords balanced across their pommels

Colwyn glances up toward the Queens balcony

EXT QU

ENS BALCONY - INTERCUT

The Queen lies on a couch attended by her two girls-in-
waiting She answers Colwyns look with a nod

COLWYN
(shouts to Rowan)
I am Colwyn son of Turold of the
eagles blood and I am come to take
your daughter from you

ROWAN
(shouts)
You shall not

LYSSA

(shouts to Turold)
I am Lyssa daughter of the Queen
of the leopards blood and I am
come to take your son from you

TUROLD
(shouts)
You shall not

The two men spur their horses toward the wedding couple
who
stand perfectly still as the horses thunder down on them
Turold and Rowan swing their swords directly above the
heads

of the young couple the blades striking with a clang
Then

they wheel their horses to a stop Colwyn and Lyssa
almost

obscured by the whirling dust have not moved a muscle

TUROLD
Let it be done then

He hurls his sword at the ground beside the wedding
couple

ROWAN
It is done

He hurls his sword which sticks in the ground beside
Turolds crossing it A cheer goes up from the
spectators

and the guards on the walls

As Colwyn and Lyssa kiss a crossbow bolt strikes one of
the

guards who topples thirty feet to the courtyard below
Slayers appear around the walls leaping over the parapet
and attacking the guards

TUROLD
(shouts)
Slayers To arms

Men and women arm themselves as Slayers descend th
walls

They mount a fierce counterattack against the Slayers
women

fighting beside their men Lyssa fighting beside Colwyn

But suddenly the main gate is rammed open and a dozen
Slayers on horseback led by Modred attack the defenders
from the rear In the melee Colwynn and Lyssa are
separated

EXT QU

ENS BALCONY - DAY

The Queen and her girls hear Slayers forcing the door to
her
bedroom within

QUEEN
Help me up I will die on my feet

The two girls help the Queen to stand She faces the door
defiantly as it bursts open A Slayer steps into the
bedroom

QUEEN
And I will not die alone

She hurls a knife which pierces the Slayers throat But
even as he falls thr more Slayers enter the room and
advance on the thr women who stare back defiantly

EXT COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY

Colwyn sees that his father is being pressed by several
Slayers and hacks his way to his side They dispatch
their
assailants then Colwyn looks through the courtyard for
Lyssa who has just run a Slayer through with her short
sword when she is felled from behind by Modreds mailed
fist He picks her up and lays her across his saddle

COLWYN
They have Lyssa

TUROLD
You cant reach her
(opens a door in the wall)
Through the door
(as Colwyn hesitates)
Quickly

They go through the door and are followed shortly by two
Slayers

INT CORRIDOR IN WALL OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY

Colwyn and Turold back down the dark corridor fighting
the

two Slayers They kill the Slayers but in the exchange
Turold is badly wounded He leans against the wall
holding

himself erect by force of will
TUROLD
The passage Open it

Colwyn pressed one of the rough-hewn stones and a door
swings open in the wall A staircase leads to an
underground

passage He moves to help his father through the door

TUROLD
(shaking his head)
You will go alone

COLWYN
I wont leave you here

TUROLD
You will do as I tell you You will
try to reach Ynyr the old one

COLWYN
I must follow the Slayers Theyv
taken Lyssa

TUROLD

(sharply)
You will not follow the Slayers you
will obey my command

(softer)
You have no chance alone boy You
must try to break through to Ynyr
He has great knowledge Only with
his help can you save Lyssa

They hear footsteps in the corridor

TUROLD
Go now
(as Colwyn hesitates)
Go I command you

As Colwyn enters the passage and begins swinging the
heavy
door shut Modred appears advancing on Turold with drawn
sword Turold places himself in front of the door but he
is

weak from his wound and goes down under Modreds first
blow

Modred thrusts his sword into the crack of the door
preventing it from closing Turold slumped against the
wall looks up at him with pleading eyes

TUROLD
Spare him Modred Have you never
loved anyone

MODRED
(after a pause)
If I spare him they will kill me

TUROLD
He is your godson now He and Lyssa
were married

Modred stares at him for some moments then withdraws his
sword allowing the door to close Turold flashes a look
of

gratitude then dies

EXT COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY

n

The castle is in flames the occupants slain

n

The Slayers mounted wait in a double column for
odreds

command Lyssa sits on a horse in the middle of th
column

her hands tied behind her Modred approaches her with a
skin

canteen of water which she refuses by averting her face
He

steps back and signals the column which trots out
through

the main gate

As Modred mounts his horse to follow the column the twin
suns dip below the horizon Modred rides through the main
gate disappearing in the shadows We hear an inhuman
scream amplified by the stone walls of the gate

Modreds riderless horse emerges from the other side of
the

gate A new angle shows Modred lying on the stone floor
beneath the gate tower his chest raked by deep gouges

EXT WOODS NEAR WHITE CASTLE - NIGHT

Colwyn stands beside the exit of the underground passage
tears running down his cheeks as he stares at the burning
castle in the distance

EXT FOREST NEAR GRANITE NEEDLE - DAY

The forest ends abruptly some distance from the edge of
a

steep cliff A natural stone bridge arches from the cliff
to

the Granite Needle a cylindrical formation that rises
from

the floor of the valley below

Colwyn stands at th dge of the forest looking out at a
group of Slayers posted near the stone bridge Nearby are
a

pair of black tents housing more Slayers

He hears a noise and turns to see a Slayer behind him
drawing his sword As the Slayer rushes Colwyn hurls his
knife at the T-slot in the Slayers cylindrical helmet
striking him between th yes

EXT GRANITE NEEDLE - DAY

Colwyn wearing the dead Slayers helmet and armor
approaches the group near the stone bridge The bridg
leads

to an opening in the side of

acces

Ss

the Needle which gives

to a passage which extends some ten feet into the Needle
before it takes a right-angle turn

On the floor of the passag

a

dozen Slayers

are heaped the bodi

COLWYN

2ND SLAYER
Go right ahead brother and let the
old man put you to sleep forever
(nods toward bodies)
along with them

The Slayers laugh but fall silent as Colwyn draws his

sword

and starts across the bridge

He moves across the bridge into the passageway

over

INT

bodies as he nears the right-angle turn

CAVE IN GRANITE NEEDLE - INTERCUT - DAY

stepping
Ynyr stares down the passage toward the right-angle turn
In

his hand held out before him is a silver glaive a
cross-

shaped weapon with four equal blades

When Colwyn rounds the corner into view the glaive leaps
from the old mans hand and spins down the passageway

COLWYN
(pulling off his helmet)
I am Colwyn son of Turold

The glaive stops in midair inches from Colwyns throat

Realizing theyve been tricked two Slayers start across
the

bridge to attack Colwyn But the old man projects his
glaive

past the boy where it hangs in midair spinning and
glowing The Slayers retreat

SLAYER
There is no way out He will die
there with the old man

In the cave Colwyn stands in front of Ynyr

COLWYN
The White Castle has fallen

YNYR
Does the Queen live

COLWYN
The new Queen lives

YNYR
Turolds son was to marry her

n

COLWYN
We were married Then she was taken

by the Slayers You must help me

YNYR
I have lived in this place like my
fathers before me guarding the old
knowledge I knew when I had no
son that the Great War would come
in my time and that I would be the
one to pass on the old knowledge to
a new king Come

Colwyn glances toward the entrance

YNYR
It is night The Slayers have gon
to their tents and the bridge is
guarded by Dark Ones They will not
cross for they have no power in
this place

Colwyn follows Ynyr through a passageway to

INT TRIANGULAR ROOM IN GRANITE NEEDLE - NIGHT

Colwyn and Ynyr sit beside a fire in a triangular pit in
the

floor Colwyn has shed the Slayers armor and Ynyr holds
a

black onyx box in his lap

YNYR
This is not the first time the Dark
Ones have attacked our world They
came once before a thousand years
ago A young king and queen with
extraordinary powers were given to
us then to lead the struggle My
fore-father was their Councilor as
I will be yours

COLWYN
I have no extraordinary powers
YNYR
Your powers are greater than you
know
(indicates his glaive)
Have you ever seen one of these

COLWYN
In the old books Its called a
glaive

Ynyr opens the onyx box to reveal a golden glaive

YNYR
This belonged to the young king who
fought the Dark Ones a thousand
years ago Now it is yours

Colwyn picks up the glaive turns it in his hands the
blades flashing in the firelight

YNYR
With two or three days practice
youll be able to use it as well as
I can Then well have a chance of
fighting our way out of here

COLWYN
Two or three days While Lyssa is in
their hands

YNYR
There is no other way

COLWYN
(looks at the fire)
But there is another entrance to
this place

Ynyr follows Colwyns gaze and sees that hes judging
from
the movement of the flames
YNYR
Yes

INT TUNNEL IN GRANITE NEEDLE - NIGHT

YNYR
But it opens onto the sheer wall of
the Needle Theres no way down

COLWYN
You have rope

YNYR
IT am too old to climb down a rope

COLWYN
You wont have to

EXT OPENING IN WALL OF GRANITE NEEDLE - NIGHT

Colwyn inserts his glaive in a crack beside the opening
then ties a rope to the glaive and climbs down the wall

EXT BOTTOM OF GRANITE NEEDLE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

Colwyn reaches the ground and signals Ynyr who unties
the

rope from the glaive and secures it around his waist
Then

he lowers the rope over the glaive which allows Colwyn
to

lower him down the side of the Needl

EXT NEARBY CLIFF - INTERCUT - NIGHT

A Dark One watches them from the top of the cliff its
red

eyes peering over th dge The thing moves quickly down
the

rock face with only an occasional scrape or flash of
claw

to mark its descent

At the bottom of the cliff the red eyes appear above a
rock

- only a few yards from Colwyn But before it can attack
a

trident flashes through the air and strikes the thing
square

in the face the outer prongs of the weapon piercing the
red

yes We hear a death grunt then the sound of a body
falling

Colwyn turns but sees nothing He lowers Ynyr to the
ground
and they set off across the valley floor

EXT FOREST CLEARING - JUST BEFORE DAWN

The golden glaive stands upright on Colwyns outstretched
palm Ynyr kneels beside him

YNYR
Focus on the glaive

Colwyn tenses with concentration The glaive begins to
spin
at first slowly then faster and faster until its a
golden

blur

YNYR
Reach out with your mind Reach out
to Lyssa

Colwyn furrows his brow in concentration

COLWYNS TELEPATHIC SEARCH - INTERCUT

Through a translucent image of Lyssa we s stretches of
terrain moving past bizarre forests and valleys
gargoyle
mountains rainbow lakes

COLWYN
(sweating)
There is nothing

YNYR
Reach out farther Call to her

COLWYN (OVER)
Lyssa Lyssa

EXT FORTRESS OF KRULL IN THE MOUNTAINS - JUST BEFORE
DAWN

x

A LONG SHOT SHOWS only a series of jagged peaks but as
we
MOVE IN we SEE the outlines of a gigantic fortress
designed to blend into the mountains

Lyssa walks along the parapets of the fortress a cold
wind

whipping at her light garments The occasional glint of
talon or beak the quick flash of a red eye tell us that
she is closely watched and guarded

COLWYN (OVER)
(faintly at first then

louder)
Lyssa Lyssa
LYSSA (OVER)
Colwyn

INTERCUT COLWYN AND LYSSA

COLWYN (OVER)
Have they harmed you

LYSSA (OVER)
No They watch me closely but they
havent harmed me

YNYR
(to Colwyn)
Where We must know where she is

Colwyns face is bathed in sweat his hand clenched
tight

COLWYN (OVER)
Lyssa Where are they keeping you

LYSSA (OVER)
In a great fortress in the
mountains Wait Somethings
happening

As the twin suns edge above the horizon the fortress
fades
and disappears The whistle of the wind changes to

EXT FORTRESS OF KRULL IN THE JUNGLE - DAWN

tropical bird sounds as the Fortress appears in the
midst of the jungle its walls covered with liana vines

LYSSA (OVER)
Everythings changed Now the
fortress is in the jungle

Colwyns body is shaking from the strain of maintaining
contact Ynyr grips his shoulder

YNYR
Enough boy

But Colwyn continues to concentrate

YNYR

Enough

Ynyr slaps him sharply knocking him backward The boy
lies
xhausted breathing heavily

YNYR
You must break when the strain
becomes too great or you will harm
yourself And you must concentrate
your powers for when they are needed
most What did she answer

COLWYN
She was in a great fortress first
in the mountains then in the
jungle How is that possible

YNYR
It is the Fortress of Krull I know
it only from the stories of wars on
other worlds They did not use it on
our world in the first great war
for it costs them enormous power
This time they mean to conquer at
all costs

COLWYN
The Fortress moves

YNYR
Yes Each dawn it rises ina
different land sometimes in the
mountains sometimes in the jungle
sometimes the desert sometimes the
sea Never in the same place twic

COLWYN
Then even if Lyssa tells us where
she is well never be able to reach
her for they will never allow the
Fortress to rise near us

YNYR
No They occupy the Fortress but
they cannot control its movement It
is moved by Fate And sooner or
later Fate will place it near us

COLWYN
Then we must be ready Five leagues
from here is the Eastern Tower I
know the Barons who hold it Good
men and brave They will help us

YNYR
You have not slept in two days

COLWYN
Nor will I till my bride is beside
me

hey set off through the forest

RESUME - LYSSA

LYSSA
(calling)
Colwyn Colwyn

She hears the scrape of a taloned foot behind her and
hurries along the parapet She stops and looks down at a
small clearing in the jungle outside the walls

EXT JUNGLE CLEARING - INTERCUT - DAY

A fawn grazes in the clearing unaware of a white leopard
poised on a branch above it As the leopard is about to
pounce it glances up and sees Lyssa staring down from
the

Fortress wall As if in answer to her summons it jumps
to

the ground and heads for the wall

The leopard leaps onto the walkway in front of Lyssa
then

moves obediently to her side They set off down the
walkway

together

Suddenly the leopard whirls and roars as it hears the
scrape

of a taloned foot behind But other Dark Ones are in
front

of them Lyssa is forced to descend a stone staircase
The

leopard acting as rear guard roars its defiance as it
backs down the stairs

EXT FOREST BROOK - DAY

Colwyn and Ynyr are about to cross the tiny stream when
suddenly a small white cloud materializes above th
water

bulging and gyrating affording brief glimpses of feet
and

hands as if a small man were trying to escape As Colwyn
jumps back drawing his sword the cloud vanishes with a
POP

and the small man ERGO is plopped on his seat in the
water

(which is only a few inches deep)

ERGO
Help Help Im drowning

COLWYN
I doubt it The water is only an

inch deep

ERGO

(stands)
It could have been quicksand I
might have been sucked to my death
(Jumps out of the water)
Where is this place

COLWYN
A forest near the Valley of Needles

ERGO

Blast A thousand miles off course
Well I was rushed There was a
certain difference of opinion
concerning a venison pie The
foolish man left it sitting on his
windowsill What did he expect

Perhaps h

COLWYN

xpected to eat it

ERGO

For that rudeness peasant lout I
am going to leave you hanging by

your heels when I depart Which is

right now

From the folds of his voluminous clothing Ergo produces

a

tattered spellbook He peers at a page mumbles to

himself

and pokes his head toward Colwyn - whereupon he vanishes
Colwyn glances around but the little man is nowhere to be

seen

ERGO (0OS)

Get me down from here

Colwyn turns and sees
tree

Ergo hanging upside-down from a

limb directly behind him He lifts him down

ERGO

My spells always go wrong when I am

observed Be gone

YNYR

The forest is not safe these days
Youd best travel with us

ERGO

Me Travel with you I am Ergo the
Magnificent

(flattens hand)

short in stature

(points to the sky)

tall in power

(opposes thumb and forefinger)

narrow of purpose

(shades eyes)

wide of vision And I do not
travel with peasants and beggars
Goodbye

We follow Ergo as he sets off down the forest path
heading

in the opposite direction from Colwyn and Ynyr After a
few
yards the forest seems to grow darker the sounds more
ominous Ergo glances around apprehensively Suddenly
through an opening in the leaves he sees a face with a
singl ye in the middle of it

With a yelp he turns and races back up the path after
Colwyn and Ynyr When he catches up he wedges himself
between them to get as much protection as possible

ERGO
I just remembered I have urgent
business in this direction

COLWYN
What business

ERGO
(fearful glance behind)
Staying alive

EXT FOREST CLEARING - DAY

As Colwyn Ynyr and Ergo cross the clearing Ergo steps
on
a snare-trigger and is suddenly hoisted into the air by
his

foot Colwyn draws his sword and turns to face five armed
men who step out of the forest Theyre a rag-tag bunch
garbed in various kinds of chain-mail and armed with a
bizarre variety of weapons

TORQUIL (0OS)
The lad is quick very quick

Colwyn wheels to see TORQUIL THE ROBBER leaning against a
tree his huge battle-axe resting casually across his
shoulders His cheek bulges with a wad of chewing
tobacco

TORQUIL
But also very young Six to one is
no odds boy

ERGO
(yelling as he hangs upside-
down)
Get me down from here you louts or
Tll turn you all into pigs

Torquil glances up at Ergo then spits a stream of brown
juice at the ground and steps forward to investigate his
prisoners

ERGO
(muttering as he fumbles for
his spellbook)
Theyll soon learn the price of
snaring Ergo the Magnificent

Torquil walks a circle around Colwyn and Ynyr

TORQUIL
When your enemies outnumber you
boy craft is more profitable than
courage Smile and go along and
sooner or later they will grow
careless And then
(throat-cutting gesture)
sst
Colwyn sheaths his sword

COLWYN
(little smile)
I dont think youll grow careless

TORQUIL
(grins)
Smart as well as quick Now what do
you have to give us

COLWYN
Fame

TORQUIL

Fame

(laughs)
Thank you no Fame is the burial
ground of contentment Eat it and go
hungry count it and go broke seek
it and grow mad Fame is what fools
yearn for and wise men shun

COLWYN
Fame is what you leave to your sons

TORQUIL
(taken aback)
How did you know I had sons

COLWYN
Because you would not rob if you had
no children to provide for

TORQUIL
Hah You dont know me boy

COLWYN
(fixes him with a look)
I know you
YNYR
(to Colwyn)
You choose these

COLWYN
Yes They will be more help than
high-born barons

TORQUIL
They stand at th dge of the grav
and make jokes
(shouts)
Do you know who I am sprout I am
Torquil Lord of the forest My men
follow no man but me and I follow
no man at all

COLWYN
You will follow me

TORQUIL
(shifts his axe)
And in the few seconds before I dice
you to crow-food tell me why I am
going to follow you

COLWYN
So your sons will speak of you to
your grandsons and your grandsons
to their grandsons

Torquil plunks the handle of his long battle-axe into the
then folds his hands across the top of the blade

rests his chin on his hands He stares hard at Colwyn

returns his gaze calmly

TORQUIL
And where do you lead boy
COLWYN
To the place where Death lives

TORQUIL
(grins)
It should be an interesting journey
then
COLWYN

(answering smile)
That I promise you

TORQUIL
(to his men)
I compel no man to follow me on this
journey

KEGAN
We owe you our lives Torquil If
you follow the boy so also do we

BARDOLPH OSWIN and RUHN nod their agreement The sixth
robber SWEYN back away

SWEYN
I follow the man who follows gold
He who follows glory travels without

me
TORQUIL

Go then and let greed be your

gravestone

Sweyn moves off into the forest An angry oink causes the
others to look up at the snare which holds a small pig
by

its foot as usual Ergos magic has boomeranged

TORQUIL
What have we here
(prods the pig with his axe)
Roast pork for dinner
The pig squeals his objections Torquil signals to drop
the
snare and picks the pig up under his arm

COLWYN
He needs his book

Torquil finds the open spellbook and kneels allowing the
pig to read it Pop and Torquil is holding a gyrating
cloud

under his arm replete with squeals and yells and pieces
of

pig and Ergo pop and the cloud disappears leaving Ergo
under Torquils arm

ERGO
Put me down you lout

TORQUIL
(sets him down)
You had better manners as a pig

ERGO

(haughty)

I am Ergo the Magnificent and I do
not travel with thieves and robbers

He takes two steps into the forest then glances around
anxiously

ERGO
(backing out of the forest)

Except when necessary

EXT HILL OVERLOOKING VA

LEY - SUNSET

As the band nears the crest of the hill Colwyn stumbles
Torquil reaches out to steady him

TORQUIL
When did you last sleep boy
COLWYN
(shaking off the help)
Im all right

They top the hill and look out over the valley dotted
with
plumes of smoke from burning villages

TORQUIL
They burn many villages Even walled
cities fall to them

COLWYN
(angrily)
Why do they burn the villages
heres nothing to gain

qd

YNYR
Theres terror to gain Their wealth
is fear they get it with fire they
spend it to rule

EXT FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

The band has stopped in the middle of the clearing
Colwyn
is swaying barely able to stand

TORQUIL
Well stop here to hunt Even those
who dont sleep must eat

Colwyn folds his arms across his chest tries to stand up
straight

COLWYN
(eyes drifting shut)
Im not hungry

TORQUIL
(folding his arms across his
chest)
Not sleepy either

COLWYN
(eyes almost closed swaying)
No

Torquil purses his lips and blows at Colwyn who falls
backward into the arms of Kegan who lays him gently on
the

ground fast asleep Torquil covers him with his cape
The

other robbers string their bows and prepare to hunt

ERGO
Bring me a deer No deer no supper

EXT FOREST CLEARING - AN HOUR LATER

Torquil and Ynyr talk to several PEASANTS at the edge of
the

clearing while in the center Ergo tends the cooking
fire

beside which Colwyn lies asleep Ergos face lights up
when

he sees Kegan arrive with a stag across his shoulders
and

he snick-snacks his carving knife in anticipation But
Torquil has Kegan turn over the stag to the peasants
which
nearly gives Ergo apoplexy

ERGO
(galloping across the
clearing)
What are you doing with my dear
Stop Thieves

TORQUIL
(restraining him)
Many villagers are hiding in the
forest They need food
ERGO
And do you think I live on air

TORQUIL
We have plenty of hares

ERGO
(snorts)
Food for crows

TORQUIL
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan
can make rabbit taste like venison

ERGO
I am being exploited Where are you
going

TORQUIL
(moving off with Ynyr)
I must take the old man to see some
sick children Kegan will guard
you

But Kegan spots a hare and creeps into the forest after

it

leaving Ergo and Colwyn alone in the clearing

Suddenly
dark
forest and
staring ou
and

Ergo hears ominous noises He peers into the

his jaw drops as he sees a pair of red eyes
t of the gloom He snatches up a carving knife

a frying pan and backs toward Colwyn holding the pan as

a
shield Th

trees and
knife

red-eyed thing moves toward them through the
poor Ergo is unmanned by fear he drops his

and ducks his head behind the frying pan in sheer terror

But he hears the thing stop short and raises his head to
look behind him where a CYCLOPS stands with trident
poised
to throw The little man assumes that both creatures are
trying to kill him and faints dead away But the trident
is
aimed at the red-eyed thing which has no desire to do

battle with the Cyclops The thing retreats the red eyes
fade The Cyclops comes over to Ergo and kneels to listen
to
his heart Then h nters the forest after the Dark One

EXT FOREST CLEARING - LAT

Fl

R THAT NIGHT

The band including Colwyn is gathered around Ergo who
is
telling his story

ERGO

(indicating positions)
One with red eyes the other with
one eye both trying to kill me

YNYR
The one with red eyes was a Dark
One the other was a Cyclops and it
was not you he meant to kill

ERGO
He was aiming a huge spear right at
me

YNYR

If that were so youd be dead now
He was aiming at the Dark One for
there is ancient hatred between
them Once his race had two eyes
like other men until his
forefathers bargained with the Dark
Ones they gave up one of their eyes
in return for the power to s th
future But they were cheated for
the only future they were permitted

to see was the time of their own
death

COLWYN
They know when theyre going to die

YNYR
(nods)
Everyone of his race is born knowing
the day of his death

TORQUIL
Knowledge I wouldnt want

YNYR
No They are sad solitary
creatures rarely seen

ERGO
Once is enough thank you

COLWYN
He saved our lives

TORQUIL
(glance toward fire)
But not our supper

Ergo sees smoke rising from a pot on the fire

ERGO
(running to the pot)
Oh my poor stew

TORQUIL
Oh my poor stomach

EXT FOREST CLEARING - NEAR DAWN

The band is asleep Torquil on guard As the eastern
horizon
grows light Torquil wakes Ynyr and Colwyn

EXT FOREST A FEW YARDS FROM CLEARING - DAWN

Colwyn sits against a tree brow furrowed in
concentration
the golden glaive spinning in midair in front of him

Ynyr
and Torquil look on

COLWYN
I cant reach her

YNYR
What do you see

COLWYN

Darkness Tunnels and corridors
(pause)

Wait

INT CORRIDOR IN KRULL - INTERCUT

Lyssa moves down the windowless corridor with the white
leopard at her side

Lyssa

LYSSA (OVER)

COLWYN (OVER)
Where is the Fortress

LYSSA (OVER)
I dont know Its a maze of
tunnels I cant see out

RESUME - COLWYN ET AL

COLWYN
She cant see out She cant tell us
where the Fortress is

YNYR
Yes they knew of your first
contact so they drove her below

COLWYN
She was very faint I was barely
able to reach her

YNYR
The deeper she goes the harder it
is to contact her Once she is below
the second level you will not be
able to reach her at all

COLWYN
(leaps to his feet shouts
angrily)
I will find her

He hurls his glaive at a nearby tree the weapon bores
clean

through the trunk then through two more before it imbeds
itself in a fourth But anger gives way to despair he
buries his face in his hands
RESUM

down

YNYR
(hand on his shoulder)
Well seek an Emerald Seer They
have great powers of vision

TORQUIL
Theres an Emerald Circle a few
leagues from here
(moves to Colwyn)
Well find her

COLWYN
(Looks up)
Forgive me Its childish to cry

TORQUIL
(thumbs the tears from
Colwyns cheeks)
Those are not childs tear A child
cries for himself a man cries for
those he loves

- LYSSA

She and the leopard are forced deeper in the Fortress

yet another flight of stairs

EXT

HILL OVERLOOKING STONE LAKE - DAY

Colwyn and Torquil top the hill and look down at the

lake

the surface of which looks as if it had been instantly
frozen in the midst of a great storm

TORQUIL
We can save half a day by crossing
the Stone Lake

YNYR
(coming up)

Many have perished in that maze

TORQUIL
(grin)
No maze to me my fried It is where
we take refuge when they hunt us

COLWYN
Lead us across

EXT STONE LAKE - DAY

At th dge of the lake an enormous wave is poised to
break frozen in blue stone even to the froth that caps
it

Torquil leads the band into the maze

ERGO

(walking beside Ynyr)
I wish youd tell me why that
foolish boy decided to join up with
these thieves

The little man suddenly lets out a yelp and jumps back
He

is staring into the jaws of a huge shark frozen in the
wave

(as was all the marine life in the lake including gulls
with one foot touching the water) He steers around the
jaws

and catches up to Ynyr

YNYR
He didnt join them They joined
him

ERGO
And who is he that they should join
him

YNYR

He is the King
ERGO
Well at least Im glad to see you
have a sense of humor Thats the
first smile Ive seen on that gloomy
face of yours

(Ynyr is not smiling)

isnt it It isnt Oh no Oh
dear Oh now Ive gone and done it

He scurries forward and tugs at Colwyns jacket

ERGO

Your kingship your lord high
mightiness when I called you a
s a whatever I called you I
didnt realize that you were

were

COLWYN
I was hoping I might be your friend

ERGO
(staggered)
My friend
COLWYN

I have need of friends

ERGO

(flattered nearly senseless)
No more my lord - my friend With
Ergo the Magnificent by your side
your enemies are dead men

The little man pulls out a carving knife and with a
flourish tucks it in his belt - slicing through his
outer

garment as he does so Colwyn glances down and sees red
liquid oozing from the cut Ergo follows his gaze

ERGO

(staggering)
Argh Im dying

Colwyn notices seeds oozing out with the liquid and
samples
it with his finger

COLWYN
Not yet my friend Its your tomato
thats dying

ERGO

What Oh no Better it was me There
isnt another good tomato within a
hundred leagues

He pulls out the stabbed tomato and kisses it tearfully

ERGO
Oh my poor baby

He looks up to see Ynyr smiling broadly

ERGO
(scowling)
I liked you better gloomy old man

Colwyn resumes his place beside Torquil who gives hima
sideways glance

TORQUIL
So Youre something more than a
seeker of fame

Colwyn shrugs sheepishly

TORQUIL
Well Im not impressed

COLWYN
(smiles)
I knew you would not be Thats why
I chose you

They reach th nd of the lake which is bordered by a
small

scarp Torquil hikes himself onto the scarp and reaches
down

to help Colwyn up

TORQUIL
(grin)
Im a little impressed

EXT EMERALD STONEHENGE - LATE AFTERNOON

A circle of stone dolmens emerald green in the center
of
which sits an old man blind wearing a green robe an

EMERALD SEER Sitting across from him is TITCH his ten-
year-old assistant similarly robed

A green-hued holographic image appears above the emerald
showing Colwyn and his band approaching The Seer weaves
his
fingers through the image reading it by touch

SEER
Eight come here Brother They have
traveled far Fetch bread and wine

TITCH
Yes Brother

The boy fetches a jug of wine and a round loaf of bread
and

approaches Colwyns band as they enter the stone circl
Colwyn waves Titch toward his men and moves with Ynyr and
Torquil to the Seer

YNYR
We seek the Fortress of Krull

SEER

Such a vision will be opposed Who
seeks it

YNYR
The new King

SEER
(little smile)
With an old voice

YNYR
(answering smile)
You know the voice

SEER
Yes You have left your place in the
Needle It is the time then

YNYR
It is the time

SEER
I will seek the Fortress for you

The Seer presses his fingertips against the rotating
sphere

increasing the pressure and friction until small tongues
of

flame spurt from beneath his fingertips

A holograph begins to form above the sphere the Fortress
in
mid-ocean

SEER

Can you see

YNYR
Yes It is the Western Ocean

COLWYN
There is a prisoner there
Yes

The holograph dissolves replaced by a new one which
shows a

curving Arm of the Vortex the deep central parts of the
Fortress Lyssa and the white leopard move down the Arm
pressed by an unseen pursuer

COLWYN
(leaning forward)
Lyssa

As the twin suns dip below the horizon the flames
spurting

from the Seers fingertips begin to leap and lengthen
until

the sphere is surrounded by fire its color changing from
emerald-green to crimson We hear faint hollow screams
of

rage

The holograph above the sphere begins to waver and blur
then is shattered by a holographic black claw shooting
upward from the sphere The talons of the claw are blood
red its appearance accompanied by a hollow scream

The Seer is knocked backward the claw disappears the
emerald drops to the ground

COLWYN
(kneeling by the Seer)
Are you hurt

SEER
(sitting up)
No
(grim smile)
The Dark Ones do not like curious
Seers poking into their affairs

COLWYN
Can you tell us where the Fortress
will rise tomorrow

SEER
I cannot see the future only the
present But at dawn tomorrow I can
s where the fortress has risen
that day - and every day thereafter
until Fate brings it near us

YNYR
The Dark Ones will appose you with
all their power

SEER
They will fail for during the day
the power of the Circle is greater
than theirs Only at night can they
pierce the Circl

Titch approaches Ergo with bread and wine

ERGO

(wrinkling his nose)
Bread is for peasants and wine
makes me sneeze Got any gumdrops

TITCH
No

ERGO
Sugarballs

TITCH
No

ERGO

(annoyed)
What kind of a boy are you Boys
always have candy
TITCH
I have a cinnamon bar

ERGO

You do

TITCH
(producing the bar)
You can have half

Ergo takes the bar and breaks it into unequal parts He
is

about to take the bigger piece for himself when
conscience

gets the better of him reluctantly he offers the bigger
piece to Titch But the boy takes the small piece
leaving

the delighted Ergo with the lions share

ERGO
(mouth full)
I am Ergo the Magnificent
(flattens hand)
short in stature
(points to sky)
tall in power
(opposes thumb and forefinger)
narrow of purpose
(shades eyes)
wide of vision

TITCH
(mouth full points to his
chest)

(bows from waist)
am Titch

EXT EMERALD STONEHENGE - NIGHT

While Ergo and Titch tend the cooking fire robbers leav
to

hunt and others return with small game

Sitting against one of the stone dolmens Colwyn tries to
contact Lyssa the glaive spinning in midair in front of
him Ynyr and Torquil look on

COLWYN
I cannot reach her

YNYR
She is too deep The curved tunnel
we saw is part of the Vortex the
place of The Beast

TORQUIL
The leader of the Dark Ones

YNYR
Yes
(to Colwyn)
Like you a King A King of many
worlds All enslaved

COLWYN
The first time when they attacked
long ago was The Beast here

YNYR

No Then they were led by his
underlings But I knew he had come
this time from the ferocity of
their onslaught from their use of
The Fortress They use up much of
heir strength to do these things
hey are taking great risks

qd

COLWYN

Why
YNYR
(evasive)
Im not sure
COLWYN
But you suspect

YNYR
You will know in good time

At the cooking fire Kegan arrives with a string of small
game

ERGO

(disgusted)
Rabbits and squirrels Where is my
deer

KEEGAN
We saw nothing but does and fawns
and we shoot only stags

Kegan lays down the string of game and moves off

ERGO

(grumbling)
Nothing worse than lower-class boors
with upper-class morals

CYCLOPS (0OS)
Would you settle for a boar

ERGO

(to Titch)
A boar Those incompetent louts
couldnt catch a piglet much less a
boar

He realizes that the voice has come from behind him and
turns to see the Cyclops with a huge boar slung across
his

shoulders

ERGO

You
CYCLOPS
Me
(lays down the boar)
May I eat with you tonight

ERGO
Tonight and every night my friend
for this is the second time youve
saved my life

(draws himself up)
I am Ergo the Magnificent short in
stature tall in power etcetera

etcetera

CYCLOPS
I am Quell

TITCH
Im hungry

ERGO
Smart lad

(theatrical)

Bring me my spices
Titch hands him a leather belt of spices

TITCH
I must fetch my master
(smiles at Cyclops as he
passes)
Im Titch

EXT STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE - NIGHT

The Seer kneels at waters edge washing his hands with
ritual motions He hears footsteps behind him

SEER
Is that you Brother

We see a CHANGELINGSEER standing behind him an exact
twin

except that his eyes are open and red Changeling reaches
down and places his hand on the Seers neck

CHANGELING
(hiss)
It is me Brother

His hand turns into a taloned claw which tightens around
the Seers neck throttling him He lowers the body into
the

stream then reaches into the Seers robe and extracts
the

emerald which he crushes in his claw The green
fragments

drop into the water floating downstream behind the
Seers

body

His bloody claw now reverts to human form but the
fingers

remain bloody He kneels and washes off the blood When
he

hears Titch approaching he closes his eyes

CHANGELING
(in Seers voice)
Is that you Brother

TITCH
It is me Brother

He stands and places his hand on the boys shoulder to be
led back to camp The Cyclops appears having followed
Titch

to guard him

The Cyclops glances at the Changeling but notices
nothing

unusual He takes a few steps farther down the path to
check it out - and stops just short of a point that would

show him the Seers body fetched up against a rock in the
stream He turns and follows Titch back to the campsite

EXT STONEHENGE - NIGHT

The band is seated around the fire finishing a huge
dinner

of roast boar The ChangelingSeer sits slightly apart
his

eye-lids lifting occasionally to afford a thin slit
through

which he surveys the group with red eyes

TORQUIL
(raising a joint)
Passable pimple very passable

ERGO

The greatest boon of your otherwise
worthless life blockhead is the
privilege of dining on boar roasted
by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent

TORQUIL
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than
your roast Magnificence

He glances over his shoulder at Colwyn who is leaning
against a dolmen staring gloomily into the darkness
Torquil gets up and goes to him carrying the joint

TORQUIL
Youve eaten nothing

COLWYN
(shrug pause)
We must try to get horses

TORQUIL
Yes It will double our range
(grins)
I know at least a dozen ways to get
horses All cheap

COLWYN
(little smile)
These well pay for

TORQUIL
(sigh)
Lad you have an unnatural desire to
pay for things It stunts the mind
and shrivels the imagination

COLWYN
(thumb in his ribs)
Hand over your dinner

TORQUIL
(hands it over)
A flicker of talent

Colwyns hunger comes alive as he starts to work on the
joint

TORQUIL
But I cant tell yet whether its a
talent for theft or gluttony

Ergo Titch and the Cyclops full to bursting are
stretched out together beside the fir

ERGO
If I could wish
(belch)
for anything Id wish for a
venison pie the size of a

mountain No thats too greedy
Id settle for one the size of a
house

Bardolph and Oswin stand guard

over the sleeping band

stationed at the perimeter of the Circle looking

outward

The Cyclops broods by the fire his expression troubled

EXT PATH TO STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE - NIGHT

As they move down the path the Changelings hand turns
into
a claw and he throttles Bardolph so quickly hes unable
to
utter a sound He tosses the body into the bushes and
starts
to wipe his bloody hand on the grass - but stands as he
hears Colwyn coming down the path

COLWYN
Where is Bardolph Brother

CHANGELING
He heard something and went to
investigate Brother

Colwyn starts to move past him to the stream

CHANGELING
(reaching out)
Lead me to the stream Brother

Colwyn stops and allows the Changeling to place a hand on
his shoulder A close shot of the Changelings hand shows
it

still bloody the blood running onto the cloth of
Colwyns

jacket

EXT STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

The Cyclops stands near the spot where the real Seer was
killed He moves downstream a few yards - and suddenly
sees

the Seers body floating in the water caught against the
rocks He realizes immediately that the band is in great
danger he races up the path toward the camp

As Colwn leads the Changeling down the path we see the
hand

on his shoulder turn into a claw The claw is moving
toward
his neck when suddenly the Cyclops bursts from the trees
in

front of them Colwyn stares in disbelief as the Cyclops
hurls his trident straight at him The weapon whistles
past
his ear and slices off the Changelings arm at the
shoulder

Colwyn spins sees the red eyes ducks backward as the
Changeling swipes at him with his other hand - now become
a

claw He draws his glaive as the Changeling reverts
entirely

to bestial form its hideous black body bursting the
seams

of the emerald-green robe

As the creature springs at Colwyn we see for an
instant

the horrible face teeth flashing eyes burning Then
Colwyns glaive strikes between th yes Slit by the
horizontal blades of the glaive th yes explode ina
burst
of red and the thing dies with a scream

Torquil Ynyr and others run up The body of the
creature

has already turned to ash forming the characteristic
Vortex

of the Dark Ones

CYCLOPS
(to Ynyr)
A Changeling

YNYR
Yes It chose the Seers form so it
wouldnt have to show its eyes
COLWYN
(to Cyclops)
How did you know

CYCLOPS
I found the body of the Seer in the
stream

They all look up the path at Titch who is rubbing his
eyes
sleepily Ergo goes up to him and puts an arm around his
shoulders

EXT STONEHENGE - NIGHT

The band stands beside a fresh grave outlined by stone
markers Colwyn is kneeling with his arms around Titch
whose face is buried against his chest

COLWYN
If he had not agreed to help us
they would not have killed him He
gave his life for us

TITCH
He was my only family

COLWYN
Were your family now

No We will find another way to
locate the Fortress

YNYR
There is no other way You asked me
why the Beast had come this time

COLWYN
Yes

YNYR
He has come for Lyssa

COLWYN
Lyssa Why
YNYR
Like you she has extraordinary
powers He would make her his Queen

COLWYN
Can she be forced

YNYR
No She must agree of her own free
will

COLWYN
Never

YNYR

You are young You dont understand
the attraction of great power and
you forget the pain of long waiting

COLWYN
Then we must reach her before sh
feels that pain

YNYR
Yes

On the other side of the fire Ergo lies awake watching

Titch who is asleep next to him his face tear-stained

The

Cyclops sits nearby leaning against a stone one hand on
his trident His eye is closed he appears to be asleep

Ergo sits up takes his spellbook and sneaks off behind
a
stone The Cyclops opens his eye and watches as Ergo

through the book mumbles a spell and disappears ina
gyrating white cloud When the cloud disappears Ergo has
transformed himself into a puppy The puppy trots over to
the sleeping Titch and licks his face The boy stirs
opens

his eyes and hugs the puppy to his chest

INT ARM OF VORTEX - NIGHT

Red eyes press Lyssa and the leopard down the curving
passage-way until they emerge in the center of the
vortex

INT CENTER OF VORTEX - NIGHT

The Arms open into the top of a huge bloodstone funnel
at

the bottom of which is the hole of the Beast Lyssa and
her

guardian are forced along a spiral walkway that curves

down

the walls of the funnel to the dark hole at the bottom

We hear a heavy slithering sound as of an enormous tail
being dragged across stone A pair of huge red eyes
appear

in the Beasts hole and we hear a husky whisper the
sound

is ominous but also attractive in the way that enormous
power is always attractive

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Do not be afraid You are safe here
You are protected by my power

Lyssa shrinks against the stone The white leopard roars

VOICE OF THE BEAST
IT am not one of those trivial ones
who have been guarding you They are
my Slaves They are to me as drops
to an ocean I rule here

The leopard leaps at the hole but is frozen in mid-leap
suspended in the air

VOICE OF THE BEAST

I rule all here

The leopard is suddenly flung backward hurled with
tremendous force against the stone Lyssa turns to see it
embedded in the solid rock mouth open and eyes glazed

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Nature is my slave here

A stone claw rises from the floor

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Its laws are mine to break

The claw bursts into flame and strikes at Lyssa with such
force that the rock around her is shattered yet she is
unharmed The flaming claw lifts her up and sets her
down

then shrinks to a ball of flame and drops into her hand
she

looks down to see that she is holding a rose

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Such is my power It can be yours

When she looks up the red eyes are gone She is alone

EXT STONEHENGE - EARLY MORNING

Before the camp wakes the puppy crawls out of Titchs
arms
and trots behind the stone It scans the spellbook lying
open on the ground then disappears in a gyrating white

cloud and becomes Ergo again As he sneaks back to his

own
blanket he sees the Cyclops watching him with a smile

ERGO
(grumbling)
I still say it was a foolish wish

EXT ROAD NEAR SWAMP OF BETRAYAL - DAY

The band makes its way past the Swamp heading for the
Widows Mountain visible in the distance

ERGO
(glance toward Swamp)
What is that awful looking place

CYCLOPS
The Swamp of Betrayal Be glad we
dont have to cross it

ERGO

Im glad
(glance toward Swamp)
Im very glad

EXT FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD - INTERCUT - DAY

x

Concealed at the side of the road are ten Slayers and
Sweyn

the robber who refused to go along with the band He
points

down the road at the approaching band The Chief Slayer
nods and hands him a leather purse full of gold coins
which Sweyn tucks in his jacket They mount their horses
and

start down the road

COLWYN
Slayers

CYCLOPS
We must enter the swamp

YNYR
Few have survived it

TORQUIL
(indicating Slayers)
Fewer will survive them
COLWYN
Yes its our only chance They
cant use their horses there
Quickly

EXT SWAMP OF BETRAYAL - DAY

A mangrove swamp with a lattice-work of gnarled roots
hovering above dark waters The band enters the swamp

CYCLOPS
Do not let the waters touch you

COLWYN
What will happen

YNYR
You will be devoured by your own
mind

Colwyn and Torquil help the old man Ynyr while the
Cyclops

takes care of the two little ones Ergo and Titch
sometimes

lifting one in each hand to deposit them on the next
root

The Slayers reach th dge of the Swamp and dismount
Sweyn
and the Chief Slayer lead them in

The band is halfway across the Swamp when Colwyn suddenly
slips and plunges into the water

TORQUIL
(extends a hand)
Take hold

But the waters of betrayal have begun their work

COLWYNS POV
He sees Torquil stand and embrace
behind a tree

TORQUIL
Let him drown

LYSSA
Yes Then well marry
be my king

They kiss

BACK TO SHOT

Colwyn draws his sword and swings

COLWYN
Traitor Shell marry

YNYR
(to Torquil)

Lyssa who comes

and you will

at Torquil

you in hell

He thinks you betray him with Lyssa

(to Colwyn)

Colwyn The waters deceive you

COLWYNS POV

from

He sees Ynyr stand and talk to someone behind the tree

YNYR

I have delivered him into your
hands Now pay me the price w

agreed on

A black claw appears pouring gold coins into Ynyrs

hand
BACK TO SHOT
Colwyn lunges at Ynyr

COLWYN
I will melt that gold and pour it
down your throat old man

YNYR
He sees betrayal everywhere He will
attack us so long as he is
conscious

They glance anxiously at the Slayers closing quickly
Titch

reaches into Ergos voluminous coat and pulls out a soup
ladle which he throws at Colwyn The ladle catches
Colwyn

in the forehead knocking him unconscious - but also
knocking him backward in the water out of reach

ERGO
(to Torquil)
Your axe Lay it out

Torquil tucks the heel of the axe handle under a root and
grips it with both hands Ergo tightropes out the handle
and

kneels on the axe head directly above Colwyn

TORQUIL
I cant hold the weight of both of
you

ERGO
Hush

He squinches his eyes shut and mumbles something to
himself

The gyrating white cloud appears with a pop and when it
pops off Ergo has been transformed into a snake with
its

tail wrapped around the axe handle The snakes plunges
into

the water and wraps itself around Colwyns chest Torquil
grits his teeth and pulls up on the axe lifting the
snake

and Colwyn out of the water and depositing them on a
nexus
of roots

The white cloud reappears and returns Ergo to human form
barely conscious coughing and spitting water

Meanwhile the Slayers are almost upon them The Cyclops
has

moved to the rear with Kegan Oswin and Rhu As the
Chief

Slayer comes within range the Cyclops lunges with his
trident slicing the root on which the Slayer stands and
spilling him into the dark waters Sweyn kneels to help
him

out

CHIEF SLAYER

Traitor

He stabs Sweyn in the chest slicing through the purse of
gold coins Sweyn tumbles into the water blood and gold
pouring out of the gash in his jacket The Chief Slayer
attacks the others wounding some knocking several into
the

water - and they in turn attack their fellows

The band stares in awed silence as the Slayers massacre
each

other The din of battle fades the Slayers dead to a
man

float in the water

As Colwyn regains consciousness the others gather round

COLWYN
Forgive me my friends I saw
terrible things

TORQUIL
They do not exist except in the
waters of the Swamp where they will
remain

EXT OPPOSITE EDGE OF THE SWAMP - DAY

The band emerges from the Swamp which laps at the foot
of
the Widows Mountain Ynyr faces Colwyn and Torquil

YNYR
From here I must go alone

COLWYN
You will tell me her name and w
will go together

YNYR
(with peculiar emphasis)
You must never know her name
(pause)
If more than one approaches she
will certainly kill them Alone I
may have a chance

TORQUIL
(hand on Colwyns shoulder)
Each to his fate lad

YNYR
(nods)
Each to his fate Wait for me at the
inn If I am not back by dawn you
will know my fate and you must go
on without me

He turns and starts up the mountain

At the rear of the group the Cyclops heads toward a
forest
carrying Titch on his shoulder

ERGO
Where are you going

CYCLOPS
Well meet you at the inn

ERGO

(hurt)
Cant I come too

CYCLOPS
No

The Cyclops moves off with Titch

EXT FOREST - DAY

Titch rides on the Cyclops shoulders straddling his
neck
He holds a small crossbow at the ready

CYCLOPS
(whispers and points)
Over there

Titch takes aim at a great stag bracing his arm against
the
top of the Cyclopss head

INT INN - NIGHT

Kegan Oswin and Rhun are downing flagons of sack and
dandling pretty INN-GIRLS on their knees Torquil eyes
them

enviously from the fireplace across the room but cant
bring himself to leave Colwyn who takes no comfort from
wine or women

COLWYN
Go join them

TORQUIL
What kind of friend do you think I
am
COLWYN
The best But my unhappiness is not
made lighter by adding yours to it

TORQUIL
Well it is true that if I received
a royal command I couldnt very well
disobey it could I

COLWYN
(little smile)
Go I command you

TORQUIL
(grins)
Yes my lord

He strides across the room seizes a pair of Inn-Girls by
the waist and swings them around

Ergo sitting near Colwyn stares despondently into the
fire

ERGO

Try your tricks on me and Ill turn
myself back into a snake and bite
you

COLWYN
You and I will guard the fire

ERGO
What else is left for a man without
friends

Colwyn glances out a back window and sees the body of a

stag
being carried past on someones shoulders

EXT WIDOWS MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Ynyr climbs toward the hourglass opening of the Widows
cave
above lit by an eerie light from within

INT WIDOWS CAVE - NIGHT

A gigantic web of crystal stretches across a vast domed
cavern shimmering in the luminescence from below At the
center of the web is a domed cubicle made of criss-
crossed

ribbons of mirror glass Light flashes off the mirrors in
such a way that it is impossible to see through the
openings who or what is within

The blinding effect does not occur inside the cubicle so
that a POV SHOT from inside shows th ntire web clearly
It
also shows reflected from hundreds of facets on the
inside
of the structure the face of the WIDOW the old woman
who

sits at the center a hideous crone grotesque and
distorted She sees Ynyr standing at th dge of the web

WIDOW
(Low)
Someone comes her

She picks up an hourglass containing only a handful of
sand and turns it to start the sand running out

WIDOW
This is his time

Ynyr is shouting at her from th dge of the web

YNYR
(shouting)
I am Ynyr I seek the Widow

But sound does not pierce the cubicle From inside it
one
can only see his lips moving

Ynyr steps onto the web and starts toward the center
hen

es halfway across he turns to see a giant black widow
pider made of crystal entirely translucent except for a
ed hourglass in the center of its crystal abdomen As
he

pider approaches Ynyr and prepares to attack the red
olor

xpands filling the abdomen first then spreading
hrough

he rest of the body

tt OaQntrnR vas

Ynyr holds up his glaive The spider stops begins moving
sideways the redness fades Inside the cubicle the
hourglass sand has almost run out

The spider twitches a crystal strand throwing Ynyr off
balance and causing the glaive to fly from his hand It
sticks in a crystal strand too far to reach Ynyr is
helpless The spider advances reddening

YNYR
(desperate shout)
Lyssa

This name has the power to pierce the soundproof cubicle
the Widow stands as she hears the name ECHOED by the
huge

cavern

WIDOW
(calls)
Who speaks that name

YNYR
(shouts)
Ynyr

She watches as the spider looms over Ynyr Then she
reaches
behind her and turns the hourglass just as the last

grains

of sand run out This causes the spider to back away

turning translucent again Ynyr retrieves the glaiv

makes his way to the domed cubicle

and

He enters the cubicle to find the Widow facing away from
him though he can s her hideous face reflected back by

the mirrors in front of her

WIDOW

It is fifty years since I heard that

name

YNYR
It is fifty years since I spoke it
to you

WIDOW
I was beautiful then

YNYR
The most beautiful woman in the
world

WIDOW

But you would not stay with me

YNYR

Could not Could not betray the girl

to whom I was betrothed

WIDOW
She was not as beautiful

YNYR
No she was not as beautiful

WIDOW
She bore you many children

YNYR
We had no children

WIDOW
You had a son

YNYR
(staggered)
You said nothing You told me
nothing
WIDOW
You had left me I kept silent out
of rage
YNYR

Where is he My son

WIDOW
I killed him when he was born
(pause)
This place is my punishment

The old man bends his head sadly When he looks up he
sees

in the mirrors that tears are coursing down the Widows
cheek As he watches the tears the mirrored face turns
to

that of a beautiful young girl And the Widow is stunned
to

find that she sees the reflections as he sees them th
face

of a young girl

WIDOW
Do not try your trickery on me

YNYR
It is no trickery

WIDOW
Those are reflections

When she starts

When will it

Her name is

Could I lie to you and still see
your beauty

WIDOW
(lowers her eyes)
No

YNYR
A young man seeks her A young man
about the age I was when I met you

WIDOW
Tomorrow the Fortress of Krull will
rise with the sun in the Valley of
Reeds But the knowledge is of no
use to you No man has ever escaped
the Web And soon the creature will
come for you even here

Ynyr touches his glaive

WIDOW
(shakes her head)
It will not help

YNYR
Then the other Lyssa will share your
fate She will grow old in the
Fortress as you have grown old here

The Widow takes a small gold hourglass from a mirrored
niche

WIDOW
Hold out your hand

She breaks the hourglass and pours the sand into his open
hand
Ynyr closes
his
fingers H

WIDOW
Those are the sands of my life So
long as they remain in your hand
the creature cannot harm you

I cannot stop the sand

WIDOW
You cannot stop time Go now before
it runs out

YNYR
You will come with me

WIDOW
There is sand enough for only one

life Go now save the other

Ynyr make his way across the web toward the

entrance The ANGLE is BEHIND HER and we SEE her hands

grow

gnarled and mottled her body become that of an old wom

Stymied the spider crouches and turns blood red A

scream

Ynyr reaches the safety of the entrance and looks back

blood-red spider scuttles to the center of the web and
smashes open the cubicle Ynyr looks at his hand the

As the old man makes his way sadly down the mountain

A SHOT OF THE WIDOW

Shows her encased in a web shroud and though her body is
old she retains even in death the face of a young
girl

INT INN - NIGHT

Torquil and his men dandle INN GIRLS on their knees
laughing leching and guzzling The INNKEEPER bustles
about assisted by a much-abused serving girl named
VEELA

whose beauty is concealed by kerchiefed hair frumpy
clothes and a layer of soot

Across the room Colwyn and Ergo sit in front of the
fire
staring gloomily into the flames

Titch comes in the back door and whispers to Torquil who
signals his men They get up and head for the back wall
where Cyclops is swinging open a pair of large double
doors

Ergo is too glum to notice the sudden diminution of
noise
but Colwyn sees Torquil and his men carrying in a giant
venison pie ten feet across and five feet high

TITCH
(comes up to E
Ergo

The little man hunches forward refusing to answer

TITCH
Sir Ergo My honorable Lord
Ergo

ERGO

First you desert me and now you
mock me Go back to your one-eyed
friend

Titch reaches out and presses the end of Ergos nose

ERGO
What Now you poke me in the nose as
well

TITCH

I dont think its working

ERGO
Not working This nose This nose
works day and night This nose has
never loafed an hour in its life
This nose

(sniffs)
What

(sniffs again)
Impossible This nose asleep whil
venison fills the air

(seizes Titch)
Where is it boy Tell me where it
is and I forgive you everything

TITCH
Its right behind you

Ergo turns and his eyes grow as big as the pie

ERGO
(awed whisper)
A venison pie as big as a house

CYCLOPS
A small house

ERGO

And what do you think a small person
lives in you one-eyed fool Leaving
me here to mope while you and the
boy were arranging my assassination

TITCH
We meant only to please you

ERGO

And do you think Im not going to
eat myself to death this very night
Huh

The dwarf approaches the pie worshipfully

ERGO
Look at its beauty Look at its
grace

TORQUIL

(holds out a knife)
Look at its insides

ERGO
No Not yet Let me hug it and kiss
it a little Let me run my fingers
over its lovely skin

(climbs onto the pie)
Let me climb to the top and sing to
it

He clambers up the crust and stands on top of the pie
ERGO

Henceforth I am Lord Ergo for now I
have an estate to rule

He kneels and embraces the crust

ERGO

(crooning)
Let us go then you and I my sweet
and hot and lovely pie

The crust suddenly gives way beneath him he plunges into
the pie disappearing completely The onlookers laugh and
applaud But when he doesnt reappear they grow worried

TITCH
(knocks on the crust)
Ergo Are you all right

Ergos head pops up through the crust

ERGO

Here lies Lord Ergo drowned in a
venison pie He died with a smile
and a belch goodbye goodbye

He disappears inside the pie again The others crowd
around
and begin dismembering it

INT INN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Colwyn and the Cyclops stand guard over sleeping robbers
and
inn girls Ergo floats half-awake in the gravy in the pie
shell a contented smile on his face He opens his mouth
and

allows a piece of venison to float into it Then he hears
whimpering and peers over th dge of the crust Titch is
asleep nearby in the throws of a nightmare

The serving girl Vella is still busy cleaning up As
she

passes the pie shell she hears scrabbling and splashing
and stops to see a puppy trying to clamber out

CYCLOPS
Lift him out

Vella lifts out the puppy and sets it on the floor The
puppy shakes itself then trots over to Titch The boy
hugs

the puppy to his chest

VELLA
(to Cyclops)
Its the little man called Ergo
isnt it

CYCLOPS
Yes
VELLA
He must care a lot for the boy
CYCLOPS
Yes
INNKEEPER

(coming over)
You lazy slut I dont pay you to
stand around jawing with the guests

COLWYN
Leave her be Shes worked hard all
day

INNKEEPER

Shell work till dawn if I choose

He cuffs the girl knocking her to the floor but backs

away
as Colwyn approaches

COLWYN
(an order)
Her working day is over Shell rest
now
The Innkeeper scowls then skulks off grumbling Colwyn
helps the girl up and sees that her ankle has been
twisted

by her fall He puts an arm around her and helps her
toward

the stairs

INT CENTER OF VORTEX

Lyssa moves around the walkway looking for escape but
all
the passages leading out of the Center are blocked by red
eyes

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Have you considered

She turns to see the gigantic red eyes in the Beasts
hole

LYSSA
I do not want your power It is
hideous

VOICE OF THE BEAST
You know nothing of power you
foolish girl You think power is a
mighty sword or a strong castle or
the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer
Power is none of these

The red eyes in the hole disappear Lyssa hears the voic
behind her

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Power is beauty

She turns to see a Greek Adonis standing behind her His
naked body glistens with oil he is incredibly handsome
(But his eyes are red) She retreats The Adonis vanishes

and Lyssa feels her hand clasped gently She turns to see
a

girl of her own age smiling at her (But her eyes are
red

and she speaks with the Voice of Darkness)

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Power is friendship

When Lyssa pulls her hand away the girl vanishes

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Power is joy

Lyssa sees herself (but with red eyes) as a young mother
holding a baby and laughing

Then she feels a hand on her cheek and turns to see
Colwyn

(red-eyes) smiling at her as he caresses her cheek H
speaks with the dark Voice

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Power is desire

She knows from the eyes and voice that this is not the
real Colwyn But loneliness and fear and longing are
beginning to take their toll She touches his hand
presses

it against her cheek

VELLA (OVER)
The cruelest fate is to be far from
the one you love not knowing
whether you will ever see him again

INT VELLAS ROOM - NIGHT

Vella sits dejectedly on th dge of the bed Colwyn
stands
near

VELLA

I was betrothed to a boy from my
village We were to be married this
summer but he traveled across the
sea and his ship was lost

(bows her head whispers)
They say he drowned but I know he
is alive I know he will come back
to me

Moved by her grief Colwyn sits on the bed and takes her
in
his arms to comfort her

COLWYN
I know the cruelty of such a fate

VELLA
(lifts her head)
Perhaps you think no man would
return to me

COLWYN
I dont think that

Vella stands and slips the kerchief from around her hair
which is long and lustrous It tumbles loose falling
gracefully around her shoulders She wipes the sleev
across

her face and almost magically the smudges and dirt
disappear She steps out of her ungainly shoes then
unfastens her ugly dress it falls to her feet She
stands

barefoot in her chemise stunningly beautiful

INT VORTEX - NIGHT

The red-eyed Colwyn holds Lyssas hand as he makes his
proposal

VOICE OF THE BEAST

be princes They will have the power
of my darkness and the power of your
blood They will conquer galaxies

Lyssa back away shaking her head no

VOICE OF THE BEAST
They will make you a queen A queen
of worlds uncountable

The red-eyed Colwyn waves his hand and a stone wall
cracks
open

VOICE OF THE BEAST
These are the galaxies you will
rule

Through the crack we see galaxies moving toward us
slowly

at first then faster We s not only the familiar
galactic

forms - spirals ellipses spheres - but shapes and
colors

never seen from Earth exploding galaxies of red stars
whirling galaxies of yellow and blue galaxies writhing
as

if in pain They move toward us faster and faster until
they becomes blurs of light and color Another wall
cracks

open

VOICE OF THE BEAST
These are the worlds of your empire

We see planets moving toward us Earthlike planets of
blue

and green volcanic planets spitting flame gaseous
planets

ringed planets planets with a hundred moons Another
wall

cracks open

VOICE OF THE BEAST
These are the beings who will be
your slaves

We see crowds of living creatures some humanoid others
with shapes never seen prostrating themselves in
obeisance

keening their pain and fear

LYSSA
I do not want your worlds or your
slaves

VOICE OF THE BEAST
Then look

Another wall cracks open We see Colwyn and Vella ina
close
embrace

LYSSA

VOICE OF THE BEAST
These walls do not lie He will
betray you

Colwyn and Vella in each others arms

VELLA

COLWYN
I cannot take comfort when she has
none

VELLA
Then give me comfort Sleep with me
tonight

COLWYN

I cannot betray my bride

VELLA
One night is no betrayal Have pity
on me
(begins to cry)
Please I beg you do not refuse me
You do not know the price

Her tears wash the blue dye from her eyes and we see that
her eyes are red

Colwyn is in the arms of a Dark One

COLWYN
I feel your pain but I cannot
betray her

VELLA
You will not then

COLWYN
I cannot

Vellas left hand turns into a claw She moves it toward
his

neck then stops She begins to cry blood-red tears run
down her cheeks

VELLA
My master told me make him betray
her if he will not kill him

Colwyn steps back from her

VELLA
(thrusts out her claw)
Yes he is my master

Colwyn plucks his glaive from his belt and poises it to
throw

VELLA
These talons were a heartbeat from
your throat I could have killed you
in an instant

Colwyn lowers the glaiv

VELLA

But in the hour I knew you I loved
you That love is life for you and
death for me Remember m

In the Vortex Lyssa stares defiantly at the red-eyed
Colwyn

LYSSA
It is you who are betrayed

The red-eyed Colwyn extends his left hand which turns
into

a claw the talons clutch the empty air - and in her
room

Vella gasps as she is strangled

The red-eyed Colwyn snaps his arm sideways - and Vella is
flung across her room against the wall Her body
disintegrates leaving only gray ash and an empty
chemise

COLWYN
Have faith Lyssa I will come

In the Vortex the false Colwyn has vanished The huge
red
yes have reappeared in the Beasts hole

LYSSA
He will come for me

VOICE OF THE BEAST (OVER)
He will not come You will be my
queen

The eyes recede accompanied by the heavy slithering
sound

The band watches from the edge of the marsh as the
Cyclops

stands knee-deep in water facing the charge of a dozen
fire-mares

ERGO
Theyll trample him to death

YNYR
No He will master the leader

The fire-mares charge past the Cyclops who disappears in
a

cloud of smoke and steam and spray They wheel and charge
again circling him He fixes his eyes on the lead mare

who

pulls out of the circle and comes toward him The Cyclops
places his hand on the mares muzzle and the horse stands
quietly The others follow suit forming a circle around

him

EXT MARSH - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The band is mounted except for the Cyclops Titch sits
behind Colwyn

to

speak but no words come out The Cyclops embraces him

ERGO
My heart stays here

And mine goes with you

Ergo moves off wiping his nose on his sleeve Colwyn is

(to Colwyn as they ride)
He ran a great risk helping us
today If he opposes his fate his
death will be terribly painful

COLWYN
(Looking back)
Let us wish him peace

The Cyclops is sitting cross-legged on the ground having
wound a white linen headband around his forehead Titch
sits

beside him

TORQUIL
(pointing up)
We must cover a hundred leagues
before sunrise

COLWYN
(stand in his stirrups)
At the gallop

As the mares increase their speed their sparking hooves
begin to flash until at full gallop their feet and
fetlocks are enveloped in flame They thunder down the
road

on a carpet of fire

EXT RIDGE - SUNSET

In long shot we s the fire-mares silhouetted against
the

darkening sky galloping along the spine of the ridge on
a

thin line of flame

EXT FORD - NIGHT

A GATEKEEPER comes out of his hut as he hears approaching
hoof-beats A wooden gate stretches across the road
barring

the ford

EXT LOG ROAD IN SWAMP - NIGHT

R

With hoofbeats audible in the distance half a dozen

THIEVES

huddle on the log road preparing an ambush

LEADER
To your places If they resist show

no mercy

The thieves kneel at the edge of the log road weapons at
the ready The Leader stands in the middle of the road
notches an arrow and draws his bow

LEADER

Hold or you are

dead men

His eyes turn to saucers as the fire-mares round the

curve

and bear down on him He yelps and dives into the swamp
along with the rest of his band

EXT VALLEY OF REEDS - JUST B

The fire-mares thunder
swamp-water and the log

EFOR

E DAWN

The horizon shows light gray as the fire-mares streak
across
the valley leaving a trail of blazing reeds

Two dozen Slayers ride from the Fortress to oppose them

COLWYN
(shouts to Torquil)
Its almost dawn Flank them

Torquil leads half the band to the right Colwyn leads
the

other half to the left They sweep past the Slayers on
either side surrounding them with a ring of fire The
Slayers ar nveloped by flames as the band reconverges
and

heads toward the high wall of the Fortress

But a dismounted Slayer pierces the fiery wall his
clothes

flaming and hurls a spear at Rhun at the tail of the
band

Colwyn and Torquil look back and see Rhun skewered by the
spear the point protruding from his chest Torquil
shakes

his head and they continue toward the wall

But atop the wall hidden behind the crenellated parapet
wait another dozen Slayers with cauldrons of boiling
pitch

at the ready

Colwyn reaches the bottom of the wall and swings off his
mare

COLWYN
Up the wall Quickly

The others dismount and follow him up the wall which is
canted back some twenty degrees from the vertical
allowing

them to clamber up the stone courses But suddenly a
stream
of boiling pitch pours down the wall toward them

TORQUIL
Look out

They dodge the hissing steam of pitch but a second
stream
catches Oswin who screams as hes enveloped by the
boiling
liquid

Colwyn and Torquil look up to see a cauldron of pitch
being

moved into position directly above them But Torquil
points

down the wall where

the Cyclops is galloping along the parapet th

hooves

of his fire-mare sparking against the stone Titch stands
on

the saddle behind him with a crossbow laid across his
broad

shoulder The boy looses a bolt and hits one of the

S

a

layers

t the cauldron saving Colwyn and Torquil
The Slayers loose a hail of arrows several of which
strike

the Cyclops in the chest But he keeps coming and Titch
keeps firing bolts from behind his shoulder felling
Slayers

like deer

As the twin suns are about to rise the Slayers overturn
the

great cauldron of pitch which pours down the wall
heading

straight for Colwyn

EXT ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE

The Fortress rises out of the ice and Colwyn looks up to
see

the stream of pitch frozen solid not three feet above
them

COLWYN
(shouts)
On them

He leads the band up the wall to the parapet where th
Cyclops has dismounted and is holding off several
Slayers

shielding Titch who is still firing his deadly bolts A
brief but fierce battle disposes of the Slayers

The band gathers around the fallen Cyclops A dozen
broken-

off arrow shafts protrude from his body He holds Ergos
small hand in one of his great paws

CYCLOPS

(dying smile)

A man can ask nothing more than that
his death help his friends

His hand tightens with the pain that he has brought upon
himself then his fingers open slowly Ergo stifles a sob
as
the great eye closes in death

Torquil calls Colwyns attention to yet another group of
Slayers in the distance Colwyn leads the band across an
ice

bridge to a stone door encased in ice They hack through
the

ice and swing open the door which opens onto a set of
stone

stairs leading down

TORQUIL
(glance toward Slayers)
Ill stay behind and keep them busy

YNYR
It is not necessary They will not
follow

INT STONE STAIRWAY - INTERCUT - DAY

The band moves down the stairs

Above the Slayers reach the stone door but theyre
clearly

reluctant to descend One steps forward and starts down -
but then hears th rie screams of the Dark Ones below
He

scurries back up and with the others backs away from
the

door

On the stairs below th rie screams are deafening
echoing through the stone corridors Ynyr leads the band
taking them down the stairs across a landing and down
another flight of stairs

Torquil notices mortar crumbling between the stones of
the
staircase

TORQUIL
Look

YNYR
Yes they are weakening It takes
great power to maintain the
Fortress and they hav xpended
much

INT STONE CORRIDOR

The band hurries down the corridor pursued by dozens of
red
eyes

TORQUIL
(Looking back)
Theyre gaining on us
(draws his sword)
We must slow them up with steel

They are standing beneath a Romanesque arch that supports
the wall

COLWYN
(looks up at the arch)
Better stone than steel

He draws his sword and inserts it beside the capstone of
the

arch working the blade to loosen the mortar Torquil
follows his thought and begins chopping at the mortar on
the

other side of the capstone

The red eyes are almost on them when they finally succeed
in

dislodging the capstone They jump back as the capstone
falls and the arch collapses blocking the corridor with
a

wall of stone rubble

TORQUIL
Youre resourceful my lad
(grins)
I tell you one year under my
tutelage and I could make you the
Prince of Thieves

COLWYN
Subject to the King no doubt

TORQUIL
(modest bow)
Naturally
Suddenly a black claw bursts from the stone rubble and

clutches Torquil by the neck Colwyn quickly draws his

sword
and hacks off the arm

which disintegrates into gray ash

TORQUIL

(fingering his neck)
A good thrust my friend Another
second and thered have been nothing
between my head and shoulders but
bad memories

COLWYN

I intend to keep you alive your
majesty So you can abdicate your
throne and become my Warlord

TORQUIL

Perhaps If the pay is good

Colwyn signals Ynyr who leads the group down the

corridor

and then down yet another flight of stone stairs They

emerge in

INT CAVERN OF AGE

A pillared cave pitch black We hear the rasping sound

of

labored breathing as of old men close to death

COLWYN

(calls softly)
Stay together

They move through the cave weapons at the ready A

feeble
voice calls out

Torquil

OLD TORQUIL
Torquil turns to see a wizened hollow-eyed old man
himself
at the end of his life

OLD TORQUIL
Do not let this happen Torquil

A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH steps out from behind a pillar she
is

eighteen wearing a transparent garment that shows the
stunning beauty of her young body She holds a golden
goblet

containing a rainbow-colored liquid

PRIESTESS
It need not happen Torquil Drink
the rainbow It is youth

She reaches behind the pillar and takes the hand of YOUNG
TORQUIL pulling him into view it is Torquil as he was
at

eighteen

PRIESTESS
It is your youth Torquil

YNYR
(touches Torquil)
This is the Cavern of Age Touch
nothing take nothing or the future
will be plunged into your heart

Torquil shudders as he looks at the old man he will
become

horrified by the gaping face of his own future Colwyn
takes

his arm and gently pulls him away But the Priestess of
Youth slips ahead appearing again with the Young
Torquil

this time in passionate embrace As she caresses th
youth

she holds out the goblet to Torquil

PRIESTESS
Drink the rainbow Torquil Youth is
yours I am yours Take me Torquil

COLWYN
(guiding him past)
She lies my friend

Now it is Ergos turn to confront the future He sees
himself as an old man bald and shrunken at the edge of
death

OLD ERGO
Ergo save yourself Save yourself
from this

From behind a pillar appears a FAIRY PRIESTESS OF YOUTH
golden-haired beautiful holding a gold goblet She
tilts

the goblet and pours some of the rainbow liquid into her
hand

FATRY PRIESTESS
(holds out her cupped hand)
Drink from my hand Ergo I can save
you

Ergo starts toward her but Titch grabs his arm

TITCH
(yanking him back)
Ergo

Ergo allows himself to be pulled along gazing back
wistfully

ERGO
Oh she was so beautiful - and I was
so ugly

TITCH
Would you desert your friends

ERGO
(shaking himself out of it)
No no Im with you boy

Bringing up the rear of the group is Kegan He looks to
the

side and gasps in horror as he sees himself at age
eighty

writhing on the floor wracked by the pain of a horrible
last illness

OLD KEGAN
(gasping)
Disease and pain Kegan This is
your future

A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH appears She is very young perhaps
fifteen with the kind of beauty that makes a man catch
his
breath She holds out the goblet her face full of
compassion and concern

VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS

(pleading with him)

Oh please Kegan dont let this
happen Come to me as you were

A YOUNG KEGAN steps out beside her He is sixteen a
golden
youth

VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
Come to me young Kegan

She steps forward moving very close to him

VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
(whispers)
Your youth is in the goblet come to

me in the rainbow
No mortal man could resist her She holds the goblet to
his
lips and he drinks

TORQUIL
(sees him and shouts)
Kegan
YNYR

It is too late He has drunk

The Priestess embraces Kegan As they kiss a rainbow
arches

down and envelopes them in its multi-colored light But
the

colors soon fade and the rainbow becomes an arc of white
light growing brighter and more intense In the blinding
light the Priestess begins to age turning old before
our

eyes as does Kegan himself

The others watch frozen in horror as Kegan struggles to
scape her embrace But she clutches him with bony
fingers

pressing her wrinkled mouth to his They topple to the
floor writhing in each others arms their skin turning
to

parchment The writhing stops Two skeletons lie on the
floor locked in fatal embrace the white bones
shimmering

in the arc of light

As the others continue through the cave Ergo takes
Titchs
hand and places it on his arm

ERGO
Keep a tight hold boy in case I
get any more crazy ideas

INT OUTER WALL OF VORTEX

The band approaches the curving bloodstone wall of the
Vortex Great circular openings in the wall indicate the
terminal of the Arms

YNYR
(to Colwyn)

They will hold Lyssa in the Center
of the Vortex the place of th
Beast where its power is greatest
No man can match it there Lyssa
must try to move toward us For as
Ww nter the Vortex and move closer

COLWYN
(waits then finishes the
sentence)
The Beast will kill her

YNYR
Yes To keep her from you But now
that we are inside the Fortress you
will be able to contact her

Colwyn kneels on the floor elbow on knee bending his
forehead against his hand in concentration

COLWYN (OVER)

Lyssa

INT CENTER OF VORTEX - INTERCUT

Lyssa is halfway up the spiraled wall of the Vortex
midway
between the Beasts hole below and the passage above -
all

of which are guarded by red eyes

LYSSA (OVER)

Colwyn
COLWYN (OVER)
You must move away from the Center

LYSSA (OVER)
All the passages are guarded

YNYR
(hand on Colwyns shoulder)
She must make a glaive

COLWYN (OVER)
Lyssa your bracelets Bend them
straight and cross them

Lyssa removes a pair of gold bracelets from her arm
bends

them straight and forms a cross

COLWYN (OVER)
Now grip them in your hand

She wraps her fingers around the intersection of the
cross
converting the bracelets into a kind of homemade glaive

COLWYN (OVER)
Will your power outward

LYSSA (OVER)
I dont know how

COLWYN (OVER)
You have the power Will it

As Lyssa frowns in concentration her glaive begins to
glow

LYSSA (OVER)
Yes I can do it

YNYR
(to Colwyn)
West

COLWYN (OVER)
Take the western passage

LYSSA (OVER)
All directions are the same her

YNYR
(to Colwyn)
The spiral begins in the west

COLWYN (OVER)
Where the spiral begins

Lyssa looks up to where the spiral begins

LYSSA (OVER)
Yes

COLWYN (OVER)
Move quickly We are coming for you
We are in the Fortress

LYSSA (OVER)
(as she smiles)
I knew you would come

At the outer wall the band is midway between two of the
Arms Ynyr looks from one to the other then chooses the
one

on the left

And in the Center Lyssa must make a similar choice for
the

spiral begins midway between two of the Arms She also
chooses the one on the left She holds the shining glaive
in

front of her as she moves into the Arm and we hear the
scrape of talons and the gutturals of frustration as the
red

yes are forced to retreat before it

INT FIRST ARM OF VORTEX

The band moves down the curving Arm toward the Center

INT SECOND ARM OF VORTEX

Lyssa moves out the adjacent Arm away from the Center
She

holds her glaive in front of her forcing back the red
eyes

INT CENTER OF VORTEX

The huge red eyes of the Beast rise toward the top of its
hole We hear a hideous scream of rage as the Beast
discovers Lyssa gone

We do not actually see it emerge from its hole but we
see

the reaction of the lesser Dark Ones guarding the
passages

they shrink in fear fleeing up the passages as the Beast
climbs out of its hole and up the side of the spiral
funnel

As the Beast moves into the west passage we catch a
glimpse

of one taloned foot it is so large that the mind cant
conceive of a living creature this huge It leaves behind
a

trail of black mud mixed with fragments of a bizarre
seaweed dark red with spiral leaves

INT SECOND ARM OF VORTEX

Lyssa glances back fearfully as she hears the Beast
coming
up the Arm

LYSSA
Colwyn Where are you Colwyn

INT FIRST ARM OF VORTEX

Ynyr leads the band down the Arm
YNYR
(worried)

We should have reached her by now

Colwyn stops furrows his brow in concentration

COLWYN (OVER)
Lyssa

LYSSA (OVER)
(breathing hard)
Come quickly Colwyn I can see the
eyes of the Beast

Colwyn turns toward the right-hand wall of the passage

COLWYN (OVER)
Lyssa touch the wall of your
passage

Lyssa presses her hand against the wall behind her

COLWYN
(runs to the wall)
Shes on the other side of this
wall I can feel it

YNYR
(covers his eyes)
I chose the wrong passage

COLWYN
She can s the Beast

YNYR
Use your sword
COLWYN
What use is my sword I cant reach
her

YNYR
(points to wall)
Cut Cut

Colwyn stares at him for a moment then unsheathes his
sword grips it with both hands and swings it at the
stone

wall The blade strikes the stone with a spine-shivering
clang He swings again - another clang But on his third
swing the blade bites into the rock sinking to a depth
of

several inches

On the next swing the blade penetrates deep into the
rock

and on the next it slices all the way through tearing
loose chunks of stone Colwyn swings the sword back and
forth like a scythe cutting his way through the solid
rock

spraying fragments behind him

In the other passage Lyssa presses herself against the
wall watching the Beasts eyes come closer Suddenly a
chuck of rock bursts out of the wall near her as Colwyn
cuts

through He seizes her arm and pulls her through the
hole

into the adjacent passage

Ynyr lays a hand on Colwyns shoulder as h mbraces
Lyssa

YNYR
You must move quickly The Beast
will stop at nothing now

COLWYN
Ynyr smiles

(divines his intention)
Youre coming with us

YNYR
(shakes his head no)
It is my fate to die in th
Fortress

COLWYN
No You cannot know that

YNYR
I can Because I choose it

COLWYN
(imperious)
I forbid you

indulgently Colwyn shrugs in embarrassment
COLWYN

I didnt mean it that way But you
cannot stay

Ynyr takes Colwyn and Lyssa by the arm and moves up the

YNYR
You cannot stay You must both
scape the Fortress or else this

t moves toward the hole in the passage wall

hear the Beast tearing at the stone wall enlarging

passage
world is doomed
INT OTHER ARM OF VORTEX
The Beas
RESUME - COLWYN ET AL
They
the
hole

to allow it to pass through Ynyr nudges Colwyn and
Lyssa up the passage
YNYR
Go now
(turns to Torquil)
Quell was wise He knew that a man
cannot ask more of his death than it
help his friends

TORQUIL
(sadly grips his hand)
hat is true

The wet-eyed Ergo is too choked with emotion to approach
the
old man Ynyr lays a hand on Titchs head

YNYR
(smiles)
Take care of Ergo

TITCH
Yes sir

The five move up the passage

COLWYN
Quickly or he will waste his life
for nothing

They increase their pace Ynyr watches them until they
disappear then backs slowly up the passage

A section of wall explodes inward as the Beast tears his
way

through Ynyr sees the red eyes and places a hand on his
glaive

YNYR
You and I were destined to meet my
friend

He flings his glaive which flies to a point ten feet in
front of him and hangs in midair glowing

YNYR
And I am not so old that I can be
swatted like a fly

He thrusts his hand forward - the glaive leaps toward the
Beast giving off a blinding light The Beast roars and
retreats

YNYR
No not so old as that my black
beauty

Now the red eyes narrow as the Beast focuses its power on
the glaive The weapon is pushed backwards slowly but
surely

YNYR
Yes you will have to attack me
directly to kill me I will cost you
power my dark friend Much power

He thrusts his hand out and the glaive leaps forward -
but

only a few feet this time The Beasts power stops it
then

continues to push it back toward the old man He holds
out

his clenched fist and stops the glaive about five feet in
front of him The Beasts power is so tremendous
however

that the arms of the weapon begin bending backward

Suddenly one of the horizontal arms snaps off and flies
toward Ynyr grazing his shoulder He staggers back but
manages to hold the glaive steady The other horizontal
arm

snaps off and buries itself in his chest He goes down on
one knee but continues to hold the glaive steady though
the

weapon is now reduced to its vertical axis

Finally his strength gives out He drops his arm The
vertical blade spins toward him and pierces his throat
The

beast moves past his crumpled body up the passage

INT VERY WIDE STAIRCASE

The five make their way up the staircase to a landing As
Torquil starts up the next flight Colwyn calls him back

COLWYN
We must find a smaller passage
where it cannot follow

They move down a corridor to

INT DODECAHEDRON

They look around in confusion at the doors in each of the
twelve sides of the huge room

TORQUIL
Which one

LYSSA
Where is the Fortress

COLWYN
In the Arctic ice

LYSSA
(points to door)
That way I can feel the cold

They move to the door which opens onto a long stairway
leading up At the top we can see snow blowing past the
opening

COLWYN
(pointing up)
Shes right Look
They hear the Beast coming closer and start up the long
stairway

INT LONG STAIRWAY - NIGHT

As the five make their way upward a terrible noise from
below makes them stop and look back the Beast is tearing
away the rock enlarging the passage to follow them They
quicken their pace

Along the stairs are small piles of fine powder the
mortar

between the stones is crumbling and trickling down the
walls

EXT FORTRESS - NIGHT

The five emerge from the staircase and make their way
across

the Arctic landscape toward the outer wall Colwyn looks
back and sees the Beast tearing its way out of the
Fortress

COLWYN
Make for the wall Ill catch up

TORQUIL
Colwyn dont be a fool You cant
do battle with that thing

COLWYN
Theres no way to outrun it You
know that This is what Ynyr was
preparing me for Its what he died
for

LYSSA
Youll be killed

TORQUIL
Dont worry Ill tap him on the
head with my sword hilt if I have
to

COLWYN
(quietly but with iron
authority)
Youll lead the others to the wall
as I tell you Now

Torquil bows to Colwyns authority he leads the others
toward the wall Colwyn pulls off his hauberk useless in
this battle and faces the Beast in his tunic The wind
whips the thin cloth as he advances across the ice to
where

the Beast waits obscured by the thickly falling snow

Suddenly a gigantic chunk of ice flies straight at him
He

raises his hand and the ice shatters streaking past him
harmlessly

Now he begins to concentrate focusing his power until
his

body gleams - then shimmers - then bursts into flame with
tongues of white fire leaping from his body as if it had
been doused in gasoline The flame is under his power it
doesnt harm him nor does it melt the snow he walks on
It

only harms when he wills it - as when he sees a patch of
Dark Ones approaching from the side He sweeps his arm
toward them and an arc of flames rolls across the ice
like a

wave washing over them and leaving their charred bodies
writhing in the snow

The Beast is moving back and forth in an area of ice
ridges

and hummocks dimly visible through the heavy snowfall
Near

it is a stone tower some fifty feet high The tower is
suddenly lifted from the ground and hurled at Colwyn He
makes a downward chop with his hand and the tower splits
in

the middle the two pieces flying past on either side of
him

COLWYN
I am no feeble old man for you to
crush with two blows
(moves forward grim-faced)
This is for that old man

He sweeps his arm toward the Beast and an arc of flame
rolls

across the ice As the Beast sidesteps the flaming arc
slices off the top of an ice hummock leaving the flat
surface boiling and steaming from the heat

Colwyn presses forward driven by grief and rage He
launches a second arc of flame one end of which catches
the

Beasts side The Beast roars with pain and retreats
driven

back by Colwyns power He launches a third arc and this
one strikes the Beasts head staggering it

The Beast is wounded now one of its huge eyes is swollen
half shut the skin around it badly charred Enraged the
Beast counterattacks Huge projectiles streak toward
Colwyn

first come blocks of ice then great fragments of stone
Finally the stone fragments begin to burn screaming
through the air like meteors

The projectiles shatter against Colwyns protective
shield

of flame but the force of repeated impact drives him
backward Small fragments of ice and stone actually
pierce

the shield tearing his tunic cutting his skin He is
bleeding from several flesh wounds and his forehead is
burned by a fragment of flaming rock

But the Beasts power is not infinite The hail of
projectiles slows then stops Colwyn resumes his
advance

He chops his arm downward we hear a sharp crack and an
ice
hummock EXPLODES near the Beast He chops again and an
ice
ridge EXPLODES leaving a deep crack in the ice The
Beast

hurls another projectile but Colwyn brushes it aside as
if

it were a mosquito and sweeps an arc of flame at the
Beast

to back it off

Then he resumes chopping with his arm crack followed
closely on crack as the ice around the Beast is sliced
and

shattered by Colwyns power The section of ice on which
the

Beast stands suddenly drops a foot or so The Beast hurls
a

final projectile then Colwyn cracks the ice again We
hear
a deep RUMBLE and a huge section of ice collapses
falling
into the depths of the Fortress carrying the Beast with
it

Watching from a distance Torquil sees th xhausted
Colwyn
staggering on the ice barely able to stand

TORQUIL
(to the others)
Ill get him Make for the wall

Torquil heads for Colwyn Ergo pushes Lyssa and Titch
toward
the wall

ERGO

Quickly quickly to the wall

But Ergo himself turns around and follows Torquil to
where

Colwyn is stumbling on the ice Dark Ones flit between
the

ice hummocks converging on them

As Torquil helps Colwyn toward the wall Ergo forms a
rear

guard armed with butcher knives from his voluminous
coat

As Dark Ones lunge out of the swirling snow the little
man

faces them fearlessly hurling his knives with deadly aim
to

protect his friends one creature falls with a knife
between

the eyes another with a knife in the neck a third
pierced

through the heart

They reach the parapet where Torquil and Lyssa help
Colwyn

over the wall The five clamber down the face of the wall
and Torquil is about to jump off onto the icy ground

COLWYN
(points to horizon)
Wait

The two suns are about to come up They remain on the
wall -
except for Ergo who slips on a sheet of ice and slides
toward the ground Titch reaches out and grabs his hand
holding him on the wall though Ergos legs are buried in
snow up to the knees

EXT FOREST VALLEY - SUNRISE

Clinging to the wall the five look out on a green
valley

Ergos legs are still buried to the knees but in the
ground The stones of the wall are shifting The Fortress
is

collapsing

COLWYN

(Jumps to the ground)
Away from the wall

Torquil and Colwyn haul Ergo out of the ground and move
away
from the wall

They watch the Fortress crumble

COLWYN
Its a fitting monument for Ynyr and
Quell and the others

The Fortress sinks from sight leaving a green valley in
its
place

LYSSA
Thats a better one

COLWYN
Yes

They make their way across the glen Colwyn and Lyssa
with

arms around each other Titch riding on Torquils
shoulder
and the Ergo-puppy riding on Titchs

LYSSA
(looks around)
Wheres Ergo

Titch hands her the Ergo-puppy who licks her face She
laughs and sets the puppy down It runs in front of them
frisking

EASANT FAMILIES come out of the forest and join them
hildren chase the puppy through the grass

FADE OUT
