ove black and white illustration showing a star-studded sky a rising sun a lake

palm trees a fawn and two children holding hands we hear the persuasive dulcet tones
of a womans voice

GRACE’S VOICE
Now listen carefully while I tell you a very beautiful story
It began many thousands of years ago though it ended in
only seven days Nome of the things we can see nowthe
sun the moon the stars the earth the animals and
plantsnot a single one existed Only God existed and

so only He could have made them And that’s just what he
did

The drawing dissolves into other similar ones while the credit titles are introduced The
illustrations show scenes from the film but sufficiently modified so as to suggest the
essence of the story without giving away the key facts of the plot

1 THE HOUSE FACADE EXTJDAY

c

Dawn breaks

Long distance shot of an enormous Victorian style house 4 dense wood spreads out
around it A thin wispy layer of fog covers the ground

Only the whisper of the breeze can be heard and perhaps the distant screaming of a
seagull ‘

A subtitle reads

Jersey the Channel Islands 1945

2 THE HOUSE GRACE’S BEDROOM INTDAY
Close up of GRACE letting rip a blood-curdling scream Suddenly she becomes silent
her eyes red and staring She takes several deep breaths in order to regain her

composure As the camera pulls back we see that she is in bed

Beads of sweat glisten on her forehead

’ GRACE is a very attractive woman in her early thirties of a somewhat delicate but at
the same time ‘stern appearance She sits up and anxiously rubs her heed Then she
checks the clock on her bedside cable and gets out of bed

3 THE HOUSE FACADE EXTDAY

O —

The house can now be seen more clearly in thé growing light

Three figures walk slowly towards the main door’ They are BERTHA a woman of
about sixty kind-faced and pleasantly plump Mr TUTILE an old man in his seventies
lean and with a splendid white moustache and LYDIA a young girl with a melancholy

expression and a faraway look All three are dressed in a manner that strikes us as old-
fashioned even for1945

BERTHA and TUTILE are laughing

BERTHA
Ah good old Mr Simpsonwhatever became of him I
wonder
TUTTLE

Oh I imagine he’s dead like all the rest

BERTHA
(sighing)
Ah those were the days

They stop in front of the door BERTHA who appears to be the best dressed of the
three rings the doorbell and then looks her two companions up and down as if she
were inspecting them She combs her hand through the old mans white hair

BERTHA
Mr Tuttle when are you going to learn to comb your hair
properly

TUTILE nods as he raises a hand to his head

TUTTLE
Oh my hair ay o’course my hair

The door half opens and GRACE appears

BERTHA
(smiling)
Good moming ma’am Weve come about

GRACE
Yes of course come in (She opens wide the door) I
didn’t expect you so soon

BERTHA TUTTLE and LYDIA exchange puzzled looks -

GRACE
(Rather forcefully)
Well come in then

4 THE HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL INTJDAY

©
They enter the house The hall has a rather dismal air about it boasts very little
furniture and in general seems dull and grey However its spaciousness and
architecture are impressive
GRACE
(closing the door and looking at BERTHA)
You are
- BERTHA
Bertha Gray ma’am And this is Edmund Tuttle
TUTILE
(politely shaking GRACEs hand)
Pleased to meet you ma’am
GRACE
You must be the gardener
TUTILE
“A Ay that’s right the gardenerthough I can turn my hand
to most things if needs be
GRACE
Well Im sure youll find plenty to keep you busy around
here
BERTHA

And this young lady’s called Lydia
GRACE looks the young girl up and down making her shrink away in embarrassment

GRACE
Hmm I was hoping for someone a little more experienced

BERTHA
Oh don’t let that baby face fool you ma’am She’s older
than she looks

GRACE
Have you had much experience of being in service

’ LYDIA nods

a

Can you iron
She nods again

GRACE
Whats the matter Has the cat got your tongue

OQ

The girl looks at BERTHA as if seeking her help

BERTHA
She can’t talk ma’am The poor girl’s a mute
GRACE
Mute
BERTHA

But she’s a good little worker ma’am I promise you

GRACE

Well all right The girl I had before talked too much
anyway Follow me

They cross the hall To their right is a wide uncarpeted staircase the
have been worn down by years of use

GRACE

(to BERTHA and the girl)
You two can sleep in the attic at the top of the stairs (To
TUTILE) You can use the shed round the back As you
can see there’s dust everywhere but it’s five days now
since anyone cleaned up

wooden steps

BERTHA
What happened to the servants madam

se GRACE

Last Monday they all disappeared They didn’t give me
any noticethey didn’t even collect their wages or take
their belongings with them

They reach a side door GRACE takes aura huge bunch of keys

BERTHA
Why on earth did they do that

GRACE
There are days when this house isn’t the best place to live
as youll soon discover That’s why I put the
advertisement in the newspaper asking for honest
-hardworking people as I’m sure you understand

©

BERTHA
Oh yes ma’am There’s noné more honest and
hardworking than us is there Mr Tuttle

TUTTLE
(Absentmindedly)
Oh ay we’re very honest

GRACE opens the door and enters

5 THE HOUSE KITCHEN INTDAY

the kitchen It is spacious and rather more welcoming than the rest

TUTILE
And very hardworking

GRACE gives the old man a suspicious look as she locks the door behind her

GRACE
The kitchen I have breakfast at eight and the children at
nine Lunch is at one and dinner at half past seven

BERTHA
What about the master

Silence For a second GRACE seems thrown by the question but she quickly pulls
herself together

GRACE
The master was killed in the war a year and a half ago
Which of you does the cooking

BERTHA
Im so sorry madam
GRACE
Which of you does the cooking
BERTHA
We both cook madam
GRACE
(to LYDIA)

Let’s see you can take charge of cleaning the bedrooms
every day and at least three other rooms the dining room
the kitchen and the bathroomsdo you understand

LYDIA nods vehemently

GRACE
The rooms are all very large but contain very litle

furniture so they wont give you a lot of trouble And you
can prepare lunch too

a BERTHA
What about me ma’am

6 THE HOUSE HALL - PASSAGE INTJDAY

GRACE leaves the kitchen and walks down a narrow passage towards a
door The servants follow her

GRACE

You can help her whenever she needs a hand How old are
you cos

BERTHA and MR TUTILE exchange a rather knowing look

BERTHA
Sixty-six

GRACE
(searching among the keys
oe for the right one to open the door)
I assume youve looked after children before

BERTHA

Actually they’re my speciality ma’am I adore little
Kiddies

GRACE opens the door and they go through
7 THE HOUSE MUSIC ROOM INTDAY

into the music room It is completely empty except for a grand piano Standing in the
corner

GRACE
You may not think that once youve met the twins They
aren’t like other children Have you noticed what I am
doing (She locks the door) In this house you must not
open any door without first locking the previous one It’s
vital that you remember this Bertha fom tomorrow
onwards Im leaving the keys in your charge

BERTHA
Yes maam

A
O

GRACE

This is the music room That old piano was already here
when we moved in Don’t let the children thump away on
it it sets my migraine off Silence is something we value
highly in this house That’s why we don’t have a
telephone a radio or anything else that makes a lot of
noise Let’s continue

BERTHA
Ma’am there’s no need for you to show us round the
whole house we already

GRACE
On the contrary Because half the time you never know
where you are in this house Youre quite likely to bump
into a table a sideboard a door or one of my children
playing Hide-And-Seek

BERTHA -
What do you mean

Silence

GRACE
Perhaps I’d better introduce you to the children

8 THE HOUSE HALL INTDAY

The group returns to the hall GRACE approaches a sideboard on which there is an oil
lamp

GRACE
Mr Tuttle you can go to the garden now Youll find
tools in the shed

TUTILE
Yes ma’am
The old man leaves as GRACE picks up a box of matches from beside the oil lamp
GRACE
(lighting the lamp)

You two can start closing all the curtains

BERTHA
Yes ma’am

BERTHA gestures to LYDIA to close the curtains of an enormous window to the right
while she takes care of the oneon the left

O

The hall is plunged into darkness the only light is the dim glow of the oil lamp
GRACE moves to the foot of the staircase The stairs disappear into the darimess

GRACE
Follow me upstairs

Rather apprehensively BERTHA and LYDIA begin to follow GRACE up the stairs
9 THE HOUSE 2” FLOOR LANDING INTDAY

They reach the top floor GRACE turns to the right and walks down a narrow passage

until she reaches a door The light is so faint that it is difficult to make out the
furnishings -

GRACE places the oil lamp on a small table

GRACE
I’m going to wake them Wait here (Before entering the
room she turns to the servants and whispers) Whatever
you do don’t open the curtains

BERTHA shakes her head GRACE disappears into the darkness

BERTHA and LYDIA’s eyes meet in the flickering light of the oil lamp The young girl
seems a little scared

Over the shot of their faces we hear GRACE waking her children

GRACE
(of)
Have you had a good sleep my little angeis (Kisses)
Come on time to get up I want you to say bello to
someone

ANNE’S VOICE
Are they here already

GRACE

(off)
Yes

ANNES VOICE
What are they like

GRACE
(off)

Like the rest No better no worse

ANNES VOICE
Are they going to leave as too

GRACE
(of
No one’s going to leave us Now come on hands
together
ANNE and NICHOLAS

Blessed be at light of day
Jesus to whom now I pray
Blessed be the Virgin pure
Whom I greet with faith so sure
Blessed be St Joseph too
Faithful husband good and true
Jesus Mary Spotless Rose
Keep us till the day doth close

GRACE appears in the doorway with her two children one either side ANNE and
NICHOLAS are about seven or eight years old Their faces are extremely pale almost

as white as the nightgowns they are wearing NICHOLAS rubs his eyes as if the light
of the lamp dazzled him

GRACE
They’re sdill half-asleep

BERTHA leans forward resting her hands on her knees

BERTHA
What sweef little children
GRACE
Well What do you say
NICHOLAS
Le us
ANNE
‘Lo
GRACE
No “low” is the noise cows make Now speak properly
NICHOLAS
Good moming
ANNE

Good morning
B ERTHA

are you called

L The children do not answer

C) GRACE

Don’t take all day
ANNE
Anne
NICHOLAS
Nicholas -
-- BERTHA

Anne and Nicholas What pretty names

ANNE
Are you going to be our nanny

BERTHA looks at GRACE as though waiting for her approval GRACE nods

BERTHA
Yes my dears I’m your new nanny

GRACE

It’s time for their breakfast Lydia (handing her the
bunch of keys) ga to the kitchen and close the shutters

LYDIA obeys and disappears into the darkness
GRACE takes the oil lamp and walks ahead with the children followed by BERTHA

GRACE
The doctors were never able to find a solution The
children are’ photosensitive or in other words theyre
allergic to light They musi never be exposed to light
stronger than this Otherwise in a matter of munutes
theyd break out in sores and blisters and would begin to
suffocate It would eventually be fatal

BERTHA
Good Heavens

GRACE
As I said before living in this house is not easy for
someone whos not used to it The slightest strange sound
a creak a door a gust of wind seems completely different
in the dark Are you easily scared Do you believe in
ghosts and all that nonsense oo

BERTHA
No ma’amnot so far

GRACE
Good good

10 THE HOUSE KITCHEN INTDAY

A candle lights the table in the centre of the kitchen ANNE and NICHOLAS sitring
opposite each other are both half-heartedly eating a slice of toast

BERTHA stands with her back to them in front af the cooker
- BERTHA

Your milk’s almost ready children Your mother told me
you were not to leave a crumb

ANNE
I don’t like it
BERTHA
(turning towards the girl)

NICHOLAS

(in a deliberately enigmatic tone)

NICHOLAS stops chewing his toast

NICHOLAS
(coldly)

ANNE

NICHOLAS

ANNE

GRACE
Quiet

We dont know exactly when but GRACE has entered the kitchen She walks towards

the table glaring at the children
GRACE
(with restrained anger)
What’s going on I want to see those plates empty in less
than a minute And don’t think for one moment that
anything is going to change in this house Therell be no
talking at breakfast Ever Is that clear

The children nod as they chew their food

GRACE
(with a suddenly gentle almost seductive tone)
Anne what were you saying when I came in

ANNE
(with the same smoothness)
Nothing mummy

GRACE observes her daughter in silence She seems about to scold her but at the last

minute she checks herself

GRACE
I want you dressed and ready in the study room by half
past ten Bertha come outside 2 moment I want 2 word
with you

BERTHA
Yes ma’am

11 THE HOUSE HALL INTJDAY
GRACE draws the curtains af a large window and turns to face BERTHA
GRACE
The postman comes every Wednesday dut I’ve just

checked and this week he didn’t

BERTRA
Im afraid I don’t follow

O

ie

GRACE takes a letter from the pocket of her dress

GRACE
I lef this letter in the post-box five days ago It contains
the add I intended to put in the newspaper asking for
servants to live in So how come you are here if this letter
was never delivered

BERTHA
Oh now I understand Weil you see ma’am that’s
exactly what I was about to explain to you when you
answered the door and invited us in We didn’t come in
answer to the advertisement

- GRACE
Who sent you then

BERTHA
No one madam We just came by on the off chance A
big house like this needs to be looked after by someone
who knows the ropes

GRACE
You mean youve served in a house like this one before

BERTHA
It may come as a surprise maam but we did in fact use
to work here A few years agoand if you don’t mind me

saying so they were the best years of my life That’s why

we came by because this house means a lot to us lot
Perhaps Id better show you our credentials and then you
can decide for yourself

GRACE
No Don’t bother it’s not necessary So you say you
know the house well

BERTHA
Like the back of my hand(Smiling)Well always
assuming the walls haven’t upped and moved since then

For the first time GRACE gives an almost imperceptible hint of a smile

GRACE
The only thing that moves here is the light From one side
to the otherEverything changes (She sighs and
approaches the window) Itsrather inconvenient to say
the least one might almost say unbearable And the only
way of enduring itis by keeping a cool head

BERTHA

Yes maam
GRACE
C) I don’t likefantasiesstrange ideas Do you know what
I mean

’ BERTHA
I think so madam You told me before that

GRACE
My children sometimes have strange ideas but you
mustn’t pay any attention to them Children will be
children

BERTHA
(somewhat confused)
Of course ma’am

Silence

GRACE
All right you can stay Ill write to the newspaper anyway
“ae just to clear this matter up

GRACE turns and walks off

BERTHA
Thank you very much ma’am

GRACE nods her head slightly and disappears into the shadows
12 THE HOUSE KITCHEN INT-DAY

BERTHA enters the kitchen once more and begins to clear the iable The children are
drinking from their mugs

ANNE
(taking her mug from her mouth)
It did happen

She carries on drinking

GRACE nods

GRACE

It’s ime to wake the children

BERTHA

16 THE HOUSE STUDY ROOM INTDAY

GRACE and her evo children are sitting round a small table A candle in the centre
Sheds enough light for them to read by

NICHOLAS
(reading)
“Ona certain occasion two children called Justus and
Pastor refused to worship”

C) GRACE
Just a minute Where’s the stress on Pastor
ANNE puts her hand up
ANNE
(whispering)
Me me me
- GRACE
No let him answer where’s the stress
NICHOLAS
On the “a”
GRACE

On the “a” So it’s pronounced

NICHOLAS
(after a moments hesttatton)

iim Pastor
GRACE

Pastor Not pastor Start again

NICHOLAS
“On a certain occasion two children called Justus and
Pastor refused to worship the false gods of the Romans
They said ‘We are Christians and we only worship the
true God’ The Roman governor tied to change their
minds afterwards” a

GRACE -

“To make them change their minds” Full stop “Afterwards”
NICHOLAS
“Afterwards he ordered them to be beaten But Justus and
Pastor”
GRACE

Pastor

and

NICHOLAS
“ Justus and Pastorfar from being afraid rejoiced and
showed themselves ready to die for Christ When he saw
this the Roman governor became very angry and ordered
their heads to be cut off”

ANNE lets slip a giggle GRACE glares at her Her laughter is infectious and it is not
long before NICHOLAS follows suit

GRACE
What do you find so amusing Well Anne where’s the
joke

ANNE
Well
GRACE
Well what
ANNE
Those children were really stupid
GRACE
Why
ANNE

Because they said they only believed in Jesus and then got
killed for it

s GRACE
Ah and what would you have done Deny Christ

ANNE
Well yes Inside Id have believed in him But I

wouldnt have told the Romans that

GRACE
Is thar what you think too Nicholas

NICHOLAS rather more reserved than his sister hangs his heed but eventually nods

GRACE
I see So you would have both lied to the point of
denying Christ And that way youd have avoided the
Romans cutting off your headsBut what would have
happened afterwards

ANNE
When

In the next life the one that’s waiting for us after we die
Where would you have gone

ANNE
Oh oh
GRACE
Oh ohwhere Nicholas
NICHOLAS
To the children’s Limbo
GRACE
And what is the children’s Limbo
NICHOLAS
One of the four Hells
GRACE
(to ANNE)

ANNE
(reciting)

There’s the hell where the damned go then there’s
Purgatory and Limbo or the Bosom of Abraham where
the Just go and the Limbo where children go

GRACE
At the centre of the Earth Where it’s very very hot
That’s where children go who tell lies But remember
they don’t just go there for a few days oh no They’re
damned forever till the end of eternity Think about it
Try to imagine the end of eternity Come on close your
eyes and imagine it

The children close their eyes screwing up their eyelids very rightly

ANNE
Im geting dizzy

GRACE
That’s what etemity’s likefor everpain forever Now
do you understand why Justus and Pastor told the ruth

The children nod seriously

Ven

17 THE HOUSE HALL INTJDAY

BERTHA is dusting with a feather duster

GRACE
They have to pay more attention during their lessons

BERTHA

a

GRACE
In which case he should have got in touch with me I
realise this house isn’t the easiest place to get to but he
knows full well that the children can’t go out

BERTHA
Don’t they ever play outside

GRACE
Not during the day That’s why we bought such a big
house and got rid of most of the furmitureso they could
play and run around freely in its big rooms without falling
over things and so they don’t feel as if they’re imprisoned
within these four wallsthough I’m afraid that’s
inevitable poor little dears

BERTHA
You can tell you really love them ma’am

GRACE
What else can a mother do Did you never have children

gone quiet

ask after them -

GRACE

Yes I suppose you better had I’d go myself but I still

couple of hours I don’t know what I’d do if anything
happened to the children while I was out

He said we have to leave the house

I’ve just come from the hall and there was no one there

ANNE
They must have gone upstairs Theyre viewing the house
Where are they going to sleep mummy I hope you don’t
give them our room

GRACE
(rising from the piano stool)
Thatll do Anne I’ve had quite enough of your stories
Why were you crying

ANNE
Mummy it was Victor

GRACE takes ¢ deep breath in an attempt to contain her anger

eee

GRACE
So where is he now

ANNE
He went out through there

GRACE
Do you mind telling me how that boy could get in and out
of this room if it was locked

GRACE notices that the door at the back ts ajar

GRACE
(moving towards the door)
Who opened this door Aane tell me who opened this
door

ANNE
(almost in tears)
It was Victor

32 THE HOUSE HALL INTDAY

GRACE walks up and down the room BERTHA and LYDIA stand in the centre looking
rather distressed

GRACE
I thought I made it quite clear Rule number one no door
is to be opened before the previous one has been closed
Is that so herd to understand This house is like a ship
The light has to be contained as if it were water by
opening and closing the doors The health of my children
is at stake

BERTHA
But ma’am

GRACE
But madam nothing Ill have no excuses Who was the
last person to enter that room Lydia

The girl looks down and shakes her head

BERTHA
She hasn’t got a key I already told you

GRACE
Well that leaves you then

o

BERTHA
I was in the hall the whole time Then I went into the
garden Madam you saw me with your own eyes

GRACE
hope you’re not suggesting it was me Do you think Im
capable of such an oversight of endangering the life of my
own daughter

BERTHA looks the other way lost for an answer
GRACE takes a key from the key ring and places it in BERTHA’s hand
GRACE
Right as from todayT’m holding you entirely responsible
for the music roomand ‘for anything that happens to the

children as well

BERTHA
Maam

GRACE
That’s all You may leave

the silhouette of his sister dark and unfocused

ANNE s outline leaves the bedside dnd moves towards the window

As we focus on NICHOLASs face we hear the curtains being closed The room is left

ANNE returns to the bed
Almost immediately we hear the noise of the curtains being thrown open again
ANNE tuts in annoyance

ANNE
That’s enough Victor Nicholas Nicholas Tell him to

GRACE picks the girl up from the floor and continues beating her mercilessly

ANNE’s screams mix with those of NICHOLAS who runs to his mother and pulls at her
waist

NICHOLAS
Noaoo

observes the scene from the doorway uneasily

NICHOLAS

trembling in a corner Her pale skin is covered in red patches as a result of the
- beating

ANNE is standing on the upper landing of the staircase holding a Bible An area of

bruising can still be seen on her forehead
The dim light she is reading by comes from a nearby oil lamp

“So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the
garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which
turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life”

daughter in the eye

GRACE

ANNE
Yes but when I do what then

GRACE glares daggers at her daughter as she opens the door

GRACE
You can start again

She slams the door behind her

ANNE stands for a while in silence Then she opens the Bible and starts reading
ANNE
(in an exaggeratedly loud voice)

“Cain and Abel And Adam knew Eve his wife and she
conceived and bare Cain and said (even louder) ‘I have
gotten a man from the Lord’ And she again bare his
brother Abel (A certain tearfulness begins to mingle with
her shouting) And Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain
was a tiller of the ground”

“And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said “My
father’ And he said ‘Here I am my son’ And he said
‘Behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb fora
bumt offering’ Abraham said ‘My son God will
provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering’ So they went
both of them together”

BERTHA picks up a pile of tablecloths and serviettes and leaves the kitchen
43 THE HOUSE HALL-UPPER LANDING INTJDAY

BERTHA enters the hall closing the door behind her The light comes from a gas lamp
situated on the upper landing next to ANNE who is sitting on ‘one of the stairs reading

ANNE
“And they came to the place which God had told him off
and Abreham built an altar there and laid the wood in
order and bound his son Isaac

When the girl sees BERTHA she interrupts her reading and watches the old woman
walk to the opposite door and leave

As in the kitchen the light here is very bright GRACE ts sitting in a corner
embroidering

BERTHA enters and walks towards a sideboard

BERTHA
Excuse me ma’am I’ve finished ironing the table linen

Right now you can carry on reading

ANNE

No Abraham was 2 good man

ANNE
So why did he want to kill his son

GRACE
One day youll understand Come on carry on reading
(She goes downstairs towards the door) Youll see how
in the end he didn’t kill him

Silence

ANNE
Mummy you’d never kill me would you

GRACE feels the question like a stab in the back She turns slowly towards her

daughter and gives her a look of bewilderment of terrorand also of anger The girl
quickly resumes her reading

ANNE
“And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife
a to slay his son And the angel of the Lord called unto him
out of heaven and said”

GRACE leaves the room closing the door slowly behind her
46 THE HOUSE SEWING ROOM INTJDAY
GRACE enters the room We see that BERTHA is no longer there

She crosses the room diagonally walking a little like an automaton as if sall affected
by the question her daughter had just asked her

4 noise above her head makes her look up to the ceiling Rapid steps run up and down
from one side to the other GRACE follows the path of the noise as if watching a fly

There is a sudden silence
Something falls to the floor with a crash

I don’t know I haven’t done anything

just as bad

GRACE takes her daughter by the shoulders

- GRACE
Anne Tell me if there’s anyone upstairs and ifso where

- ANNE looks at her mother in silence Then she points to behind her

GRACE turns round we see a door at the end of the passage Daylight filters through
the cracks outlining her silhouette in the darkness

ANNE
There They’re in there

GRACE walks slowly to the door Although she is courageous woman she is
obviously very nervous

She reaches the door inserts a key in the lock turns it and slowly opens

She stands for a few seconds in the doorway looking cautiously within as if she dare
not enter

ANNE

ANNE
(hiding her face behind her hand)
Youre letting the light in Make up your mindeither go
in or shut the door

GRACE swallows She goes in and closes the door behind her
49 THE HOUSE THE ROOM OF THE NOISES INTDAY

GRACE looks around her The room has more furniture than the rest of the house put ©
together as if it had been used as a storeroom
There are so many nooks thatit is difficult to form an idea of how much space there
really is and much less so to know if there is anyone lurking behind some hidden
corner

GRACE moves forward and stands in the centre Her look ts distant as if she were
paying more attention to what she can hear

We slowly approach her ear
Very vaguely mingled with the noise of the leaves in the garden we detect an amalgam
of confused whispers It is almost impossible to distinguish what they are saying

We hear a sort of supernatural moan followed by a deep breath GRACE steps back
trying to-locate the voices but though they seem to be right beside her she is unable to
pin them down

OLD WOMAN’S VOICE
‘She’s here she’s here

VICTOR’S VOICE
Mummy she says she’s here

OLD WOMAN’S VOICE
She’s watching us (The voice turns into a plaintive moan)
She’s watching usshe’s watching us

MRS MARLISH’S VOICE
Sshh

GRACE opens wide her eyes trying to see in greater detail what she has in front of her
but she can only see a couple of pieces of furniture and a wall

She sees that the door of the room is open and what ts more that it is closing slawly

The fact that there is only darkness on the other side makes it impossible to tell who is
pulling on the doorknod

She runs towards the door and into the passage
50 THE HOUSE HALL — UPPER LANDING INTDAY
GRACE walks quickly towards her daughter
GRACE
Where did they go
ANNE
They just came past here Didnt you see therm

GRACE
Which way did they go

FEY

ANNE
(pointing in various directions)
Over there and over thereand over there as well

At the end of the passage in the halj-light at least wo doors seem to shut

ANNE
They’re everywhere They say the house is theirs

GRACE runs quickly downstairs and stands in the middle of the hall looking frenziedly
in all directions

ANNE
And they said they’re-going to take down the curtains

51 THE HOUSE STUDY ROOM INTDAY

BERTHA holding NICHOLAS in her arms watches GRACE Place a notebook in front
af ANNE who is seated opposite an oil lamp

everything you know

ANNE
Wait

GRACE
Where are you going

ANNE
(reassuringly)
Wait

BERTHA
Ma’am please calm down

GRACE
L will not calm down During five whole years of German
occupation I managed to avoid a single Nazi setting foot in
this house And now there’s someone here here under my
very nose opening and closing doors

BERTHA
Maam this is an old house Old houses have their quirks
the floorboards creak the plumbing clanksYou said so
or yourself
ANNE returns to her mother’s side with her textbook and tugs‘cat her skirt

ANNE
Look mummy

GRACE
They were voices human voices A boy and two women
they were talking together

ANNE
Mummy look I did it the other day

ANNE shows her the drawing from her colouring book The members of the family have
- undergone a considerable transformation thanks to Annes infantile scribblings The

girl hes drawn long lank hair and a moustache on the father The mother now has a
shock of black curly hair on her head The boy has hardly been altered Neither has
the old lady except that in her case she has not drawn in her pupils which gives her a
somewhat inhuman look (rather like that of a zombie) The girl is scribbled out

Beside each drawing there is an arrow and an identifying label

ANNE
This is the father this is the mother this is Victor and this
is his grandmother
“ GRACE

What do these numbers stand for

ANNE

(as if stating the obvious)
That’s the number of times I’ve seen them The girl
doesnt exist that’s why I’ve crossed her out I saw the
father twice in the hall the mother as well - once in the
hall and once in the kitchen Victor five times all in

different placesandherI see her more and more
often

Next to the ald woman is written the number 14

GRACE
My God Bertha go and call Mr Tuttle and tell him we
have to search the whole house right eway before it gets
dark

Yes madam

GRACE

ANNE

52 THE HOUSE HALL INTJDAY

GRACE holding a hunting rifle is looking in a drawer for cartridges The old man
TUTTLE and LYDIA are standing behind her

GRACE
We have to open all the curtains I don’t want any dark
comers where someone could hide

TUTTLE

Yes maam

GRACE begins ta load the rifle

GRACE
You both search the right side and Ill take the lei Then
well search upstairs
The servants leave

GRACE snaps the rifle shut Then she looks at it strangely cs if recalling some
distantand unpleasant memory

C) She shakes her head and leaves the room

53 THE HOUSE ROOMS INTJDAY

We see various shots of curtains being opened by TUTTLE LYDIA and GRACE

Daylight floods into the different rooms

54 THE HOUSE FACADE EXTJDAY

Evening falls

We zoom in on one of the windows of the house and discover GRACE as the curtains
are suddenly flung open

She looks behind her holding the rifle with both hands Then she takes a lamp and
moves towards the next door

55 THE HOUSE JUNK ROOM INTJDAY

GRACE enters another room In spite of the prevailing darkness it is clear that the
room is full of junk some of it scartered over the floor

GRACE moves cautiously forward She places the lamp on a table and walks towards
one of the curtains

As she draws the curtain the light illuminates a thin-faced figure dressed in old-
fashioned clothes who seems to observe her from a corner of the room

i GRACE gives an involuntary shout and points her rifle at him

until she realises that she is standing in front of a Pre-Raphaelite style portrait
GRACE stands looking at the painting for a while

Then she inspects the room in the drightar light of day However rather than looking
for signs of people she seems to pay more attention to the objects that surround her

Among the huge number of objects she finds several portratss almost all of them
daguerreotypes and photographs

56 THE HOUSE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM INTDAY

ANNE is plaving with a doll on a corner of the bed NICHOLAS is sitting on the floor
looking bored

Cb

BERTHA is snoozing next to a table on which there is an oil lamp

ANNE
Why do we have to stay in here

BERTHA stretches

BERTHA

Because your mother is opening all the curtains Shes
looking for the intruders

NICHOLAS
What does “intruders” mean
BERTHA
“Intruders” are people who go into someone’s house
without permission

NICHOLAS
Why have they come to our house

BERTHA
Perhaps they were planning to steal something Or
perhaps they’re just looking for shelter

ANNE
I know why they’ve come They reckon the house belongs
to them and that we’re the intruders

BERTHA
Where did you get that idea

ANNE does not answer She carries on playing with her doll

NICHOLAS
(scared by his own words)
Perhaps they’re ghosts who lived in this house before and
whoand who

ANNE
Don’t be stupid I already told you that ghosts go about in
white sheets and go“tooOOQo00 And they walk
about clanking chains

BERTHA
Anne why do you make up such stories

ANNE
I dont make them up I read it in a book

ta

O

BERTHA
You shouldnt believe everything you read in books

ANNE
That’s what my mother saysshe says that when people
die their souls go to Heaven or Hell or Purgatory and
that all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish But then she
expects us to believe everything that’s written in the Bible

BERTHA
Don’t you believe it

ANNE
I believe some things But for example 1 don’t believe
that God made the world in seven daysor that Noah got
all those animals into one boat Or that the Holy Spirit is a
dove

NICHOLAS
No I don’t believe that either

ANNE
Doves are anything but holy

NICHOLAS
They crap on our windows

‘ ANNE
And I dont believe that Jesus cast out demons into a
herd of pigs and made them jump into the sea and drown
Poor pigs It wasn’t their fault

BERTHA smiles at the idea Then she becomes serious

BERTHA
Have you mentioned this to your mother

The children are quick co shake their heads as if the very thought of it scared them

ANNE
Do you believe in ghosts Bertha

BERTHA finding the question difficult takes her time in answering
BERTHA

(rather nervous)
Ofcourse not

57 THE HOUSE JUNK ROOM INTDAY

GRACE is lost in thought her eyes glued to the portrait piled up in front of her

After a few moments’ mental debate she eventually takes out af her skirt pocket the
page from Annes colouring book and places it beside the portraits as she goes through

them one by ore comparing them with her daughters drawing

From time to time she looks towards the door as if she were ajraid to be caught red-
handed

She opens a very dusty black bound album Faces from the previous century pass

before her gaze with a solemnity characteristic of old-fashioned poses They all have
something in common the subjects are all sitting or lying down with their eyes closed

BERTHA
(of)
Ma’am

GRACE stands up quickly hiding her daughters drawing in her pocket

GRACE
Yes

The door opens and BERTHA appears

BERTHA
They’ve searched everywhere There’s no one downstairs
GRACE
Good Then tell them to go upstairs Ill join them in a
minute
BERTHA
(turning to leave)
Yes ma’am
GRACE
Bertha -
BERTHA
(turning back)
Yes
GRACE

Have you any idea what this might be
GRACE goes up to the old woman and shows her the album

BERTHA
(as if stating the obvious)
It’s a photograph album madam

GRACE
Yes but everyone’s asleep look

BERTHA
They’re not asleep madam They’re dead

GRACE looks at the old woman with a mixture of surprise and terror

a

BERTHA
It’s a book of the dead

GRACE
(flipping through the pages with the tips of her fingers)
I’ve never seen anything like it

BERTHA
It was common practice during the last century They
photographed the dead in the hope that their souls would
live on in the portrait

GRACE
There are even group portraitsAnd children It’s
“macabre How could those people be so superstitious It
shouldn’t have been allowed

BERTHA
Grief over the death of a loved one can lead people to do
the strangest things

On the last page there are some faint tear marks in the form of an X as if someone had
hastily ripped out a photo GRACE gazes at the marks absenimindedly while she runs
her fingers over the torn paper

GRACE
How odd someone has ripped out the last photo

BERTHA
Maam I hope you don’t think

GRACE
Im not suggesting it was you Bertha

BERTHA
Perhaps someone took the photo years ago

Nn
n

GRACE
No the marks are recent

BERTHA
Maybemaybe it came unstuck

GRACE
(not really convinced)
Yes that must be it
58 THE HOUSE LOUNGE INTNIGHT

Through the window we can see the trees in the garden waving in the wind

GRACE is curled up in an armchair in front of the hearth staring absently into the fire

‘The rifle lies at her feet °

Behind her sitting near the door is BERTHA reading the Bible

GRACE
(without taking her eyes off the fire)
Bertha why don’t you go to bed It’s very late

BERTHA
(looking up from the Bible)
You look as if you could do with a good night’s rest
yourself ma’am

For a moment GRACE seems to betray the hint of a smile

GRACE
I employed you to take care of my children not me

BERTHA
You must rest You go and lie down Ill keep watch

GRACE
You dont know how to handle a rifle

GRACE
Tell me about when you worked here before

BERTHA
What do you want to-know

GRACE
Did you have children to look after then as well

BERTHA
No No the master and his wife didn’t have any family 1
was in charge of organising the housework

GRACE

Were there many servants

BERTHA
About fifteen But in the end there were only the three of
us left

GRACE
Why

BERTHA
My employers moved to London They came here less
and less what with it being so out of the way and all
And so the house was gradually lefi empty

GRACE
It’s the same old story Everyone ends up leaving this
damned island My family went in the summer of 1940
just before the invasion And that was the last I ever
heard of them

BERTHA
Oh

GRACE
It makes no difference don’t blame them Alls fair in

her wisgfully) sometimes you leave a place and it’s as if

BERTHA

It wason account of the tuberculosis

GRACE

Ina few years ago
Pause Burning logs crackle in the hearth

GRACE
Was that when Lydia was left dumb

From the old womans expression it is clear that she does not like talking about this
subject

BERTHA
Yes I think so (She smiles nervously) This poor old
memory of maine ts a bit rusty these days

GRACE
What happened to her

BERTRA
aan Suddenly one day she just stopped talking

GRACE
But there must have been a reason

wn

BERTHA shakes her head

BERTHA
If there was I never found out

A GRACE
But people don’t just stop talking like that for no reason
These things are always the result of some sort of
trauma(To herself) Something must have happened to
her (Pause) Were your employers good to you

BERTHA
Oh they were very pleasant indeed

- GRACE
You don’t have to lie Bertha

BERTHA
No no madam I’m serious They were always very kind

GRACE
Do you know what became of them whether they’re still

BERTHA
No to be honest I don’t Goodnight maam

GRACE
Goodnight Bertha

The old lady leaves the lounge
GRACE stares atthe fire deep in thought

NICHOLAS

ANNE

You know mother doesn’t let us leave the room

NICHOLAS

ANNE thinks for a moment Then she makes a gesture of impatience and gets out of
bed

ANNE
Face the wall

NICHOLAS as if he were already accustomed to this turns round and faces the wall
Behind him we see ANNE rummaging around in some part of the room
NICHOLAS
Hurry up I’m bursting
ANNE approaches him and hands him two keys

ANNE
This one is for here and this one for the bathroom

NICHOLAS
No I don’t want to go on my own

ANNE
(frowning with impatience)
Here we go

NICHOLAS
(a little ashamed)
Im scared What if 1 bump into the intuders
ANNE
IntrudersAll right come on
The children stealthily open the door and leave the room

60 THE HOUSE PASSAGE WITH VIRGIN INTNIGBT

The children step into the passage Moonlight shines through the windows

They proceed on tiptoe

Suddenly NICHOLAS stops dead staring towards the end of the passage

ANNE
What is it

NICHOLAS

(in an almost imperceptible whisper)
There’s someone there

ANNE
Where
NICHOLAS
(gesturing with his head)
Look

At the end of the passage there i is a-statue af the Virgin with a raised arm Next to ita
human silhouettecan be made our

ANNE stands for a few moments scrutinising the darkness Then her expression
relaxes

ANNE
It’s the shadow of the Virgin silly
NICHOLAS
No no
ANNE

Nicholas it’s the shadow of the Virgin

O

NICHOLAS
Lets go back

ANNE begins to walk to the end af the passage

ANNE
Don’t be stupid
NICHOLAS
Don’t go don’t go
ANNE

(walking)
Cowardy custard

NICHOLAS watches in horror as his sister stands next to the shadow

ANNE
(looking ar NICHOLAS

See It’s only a shad

The shadow suddenly shoots out a black arm and grasps the girl

ANNE screams NICHOLAS steps back
Moonlight shines on the silhouerte It is GRACE

GRACE
(in an angry whisper)

Do you mind telling me what you’re doing (She looks

toward the end of the passage) Nicholas come here -

The boy walks slowly towards his mother

ANNE

I was only taking him to the bathroom mummy He sai

GRACE
How did you get out of the room

ANNE
The door was open

GRACE
(tucting)
)

OO

when I see herAnd how were you thinking of getting
into the bathroom

ANNE
We were going to ask you for the key

Pause GRACE looks at NICHOLAS

GRACE
You should have gone before you went to bed Come on
then be quick
NICHOLAS
(looking very distraught)

I don’t think I need to now

The boy has an enormous stain on his pyjama bottoms

61 THE HOUSE BATHROOM INTNIGHT

GRACE is vigorously washing NICHOLAS who is standing in the bath holding up his
pyjama jacket

The boy watches his mother

NICHOLAS
Mummy
GRACE
(still annoyed)
What
NICHOLAS

Whens daddy coming home

The question upsets GRACE and she pauses momentarily Then her expression hardens
and she continues scrubbing his legs

GRACE

When the war’s over

NICHOLAS
Why did he go to warI mean nobodys done anything
bad to us

Pause GRACEs eves redden and tremble It ts obvious that she does not like talking

about the subject

Cb

GRACE
Daddy went(with slight sarcasm)Daddy went because
he’s very brave And he wasn’t prepared to let the
Germans tell him what he had to do

NICHOLAS
Why

GRACE shakes her head She seems on the point of bursting into tears
62 THE HOUSE GRACE’S BEDROOM INTJNIGHT
GRACE lying on the bed bursts into tears

“ GRACE

(groaning)
Why why

She stretches out her hand and takes a handkerchief from the bedside table She blows

her nose and tries to pull herself together
A sudden noise changes her expression She sits up and listens
The piano is playing

The gentle mysterious melody reminiscent of Satie cannot be clearly distinguished as
it echoes through the house

GRACE quickly puts her slippers on

63 THE HOUSE PASSAGE —STAIRS INTNIGHT
GRACE rushes out into the passage grasping the rifle and an oil lamp

The melody can be heard more clearly

She stops at the head of the stairs as if having second thoughes about going down

She descends the staircase slowly The wooden stairs creak

GRACE looks around her nervously as she descends although her attention is almost
totally directed towards the music room

64 THE HOUSE HALL - PASSAGE INTNIGHT

GRACE stops in front of the music room door She places the oil lamp on the floor in

order to have better control of the rifle and slowly pushes on the door handle

Almost instantaneously the music stops vanishing in a sort of melange of notes as
someone had suddenly stopped plaving but withaue releasing the sustain pedal

Cb

a)

GRACE pushes the door wide open end with the rifle raised peers around the room
there ts no one sitting at the piano although the lid is raised

GRACE takes a deep breath and enters the room
65 THE HOUSE MUSIC ROOM INTNIGHT

GRACE walks slowly towards the piano

Behind her the door slowly closes (with the inevitable squeaking of hinges needless to

say) leaving the oil lamp outside Now the only light is what filters in from the night
through the windows

GRACE stops uneasily as if unsure whether to go back and open the door again or to
continue towards the piano

She moves towards the piano

She closes the lid and locks it

She looks around without lowering the rifle there is no one in the room
She returns to the door opens it and leaves

66 THE HOUSE HALL - PASSAGE INTNIGHT

GRACE bends down to pick up the oil lamp beside the door As she does so the door
closes behind her very very slowly

Pause GRACE opens the door again
She swings it gently backwards and forwards as if checking the state of the hinges

She leaves it open for some time looking continuously to the back of the room

Absolute silence

The door slams in her face with unexpected violence The movement is so brusque that
GRACE almost falls to the floor

On the other side of the door we hear someone turn the key firmly in the lock

GRACE turns and runs up the passage

GRACE
Bertha

- 67 THE HOUSE HALL - STAIRS INTNIGHT

GRACE runs up the stairs
Ob

Noe

GRACE
Bertha

BERTHA appears on the upper lending

BERTHA

(very scared)
Whats the matter madam

GRACE
The key to the music room Give it to me

BERTHA searches quickly in the pocket of her dressing gown

GRACE
Quickly

’ BERTHA takes out her bunch of keys

BERTHA
What’s happened madam

GRACE grabs the keys and hurtles downstairs

GRACE

Come on
68 THE HOUSE HALL - PASSAGE INTNIGBT
GRACE runs towards the music room door She puts the key in the lock and turns it
69 THE HOUSE MUSIC ROOM INTNIGHT
GRACE and BERTHA burst into the room
It is empey

GRACE looks in horror towards the piano

GRACE
Oh my God

The lid of the piano has been raised again

70 THE HOUSE KITCHEN INTDAWN

BERTHA pours boiling water from the kettle into a white mug She then places the mug

and two tablets on the table where GRACE sits gazing into space with a tense
expression on her face

Ov
foly
BERTHA
Drink this and take these tablets ma’am They’ll do you good

GRACE grasps the mug firmly trying to bring her trembling hands under control

GRACE
(almost to herself
I checked that room myself It was empty And yet I felt
that someone else was there Apresencemoving
around me And it wasn’t human Those
beingswhoever they are are challenging usme and
my children

- BERTHA
You musm’t say such things ma’am You should get
some rest

GRACE

(banging her fist on the table)
I don’t want to rest I can’t And I know I’m not mad
(She-stands and walks around the table) My daughter’s
visions the whispering voices the doors that open and
close the piano (Thoughfully) That’s why that poor
girl went dumb There’s something in this house that she
saw or heardor felt Something demonic

BERTHA
(crossing herself)

Ma’amo

GRACE

(looking around her)
Something which is not at rest You don’t believe it do
you
BERTHA looks down
GRACE

I don’t blame you I had my doubts as well
BERTHA
(plucking up courage)

I do believe it madam

GRACE looks at her slightly surprised

Pause -

BERTHA
Ive always believed in those things Theyre not easy to
explainbut they happen Weve all heard stories of the
beyond now and then And I think that sometimes the

world of the deadgets mixed up with the world of the
living

GRACE
But that’s impossible The Lord would never allow such
an aberration The living and the dead will only meet at
the end of time It says so in the Bible

BERTHA
There isn’t always an answer for everything ma’am

GRACE runs out of the kitchen

BERTHA
(worried)
What are you going to do

71 TBE HOUSE HALL INTDAY

GRACE goes to a cupboard near the door and takes out an overcoat

GRACE
It’s time I went to the village and paid Father Lebrun a
visit If hewon’t come here I shall go to him And Ill
bring him back

BERTHA
But ma’am you should wait for the weather to improve

GRACE
I’ve 2 waited long enough

GRACE leaves the house BERTHA follows her

72 THE HOUSE GARDEN EXTDAY

GRACE rushes down the drive BERTHA walks behind her

BERTHA
The priest told me he would come as soon as he could

’ GRACE stops and turns to face the old woman

Im tired of hearing what he tells you I want him to tell
me personally He’s going to come today The sanctity
of this house is at stake

BERTHA
What are you going to tell him

Pause

GRACE
(pointing to the house)
I’ve searched every room in there inch by inch Now IT
want them to be blessed

GRACE walks off BERTHA watches her anxiously

73 THE HOUSE GARDEN-TREES EXTDAY

TUTILE with a wheelbarrow beside him is raking together three piles of dead leaves

GRACE approaches him through the trees

BERTHA
(of)

Ma’am please wait it’s still very early

TUTTLE
Good morming ma’am
GRACE
Turtle I want you to search the whole garden and tell me
if you come across any gravestones

TUTILE
Gravestones

BERTHA caiches up to them

GRACE
When my husband bought this house three years ago we
were told there was a little cemetery among the trees

TUTTLE
Ive not seen anything

GRACE
(beginning to walk off)
Check carefully The graves could be overgrown

(

“TUTTLE
Yes ma’am

GRACE
I want to know if there was a family buried herea family
whose father was a pianist

74 THE HOUSE GARDEN GATE -ROAD EXTJDAY

GRACE pushes open a huge wrought iron gate and comes out onto a dirt road that
disappears round both sides of the property

A thin fog blurs the distant countryside

75 THE HOUSE GARDEN - TREES EXTJDAY

BERTHA and TUTILE look towards the exit

Suddenly the old womans face usually kind and almost naive acquires a troubled °
sombre expression

BERTHA
(with complicity)
Now she’s convinced they’re ghosts

TUTTLE
(leaning on his rake)
Don’t you think it’s risky to let her go

BERTHA
(coldly)
Don’t worry The fog won’t let her get very far

TUTTLE
Oh yes the fog The fog of course

TUTILE resumes his work raking the dead leaves Suddenly he stops and leans on his
rake again

TUTTLE
(pointing to the three piles)
And whenwhen do you think we should tell her
aboutall this

BERTHA
Allin good time Mr Tuttle All in good time Oh youd
better add some more leaves to that pile

takes a handful of dried leaves from the wheelbarrow and scatters them over the tomé
hiding tt from view once more

76 ROAD EXTJDAY
GRACE walks briskly along the roadside

The fog has thickened

Even though she ts outdoors not a single bird can be heard twittering

The further GRACE walks on the thicker the fog becomes

The silence also becomes more and-jrore enveloping not a leaf rustles nor is there the
slightest hint of a breeze

There is a total stillness which amplifies the sound of her steps and her rapid
breathing

GRACE looks behind her rather uneasily the fog is now so thick that she can hardly
see anything

Only grained grey curtain stretches before her It is now impossible to detect even
the branches of the trees

GRACE stops aware that she is losing her way

Total silence

S

She stretches her arm out into the fog Her hand disappears into the mist

GRACEs breathing becomes more and more panicky Wherever she looks she can see
only whiteness Not a single shape is visible

GRACE is overcome by panic She turns to face the other way - or so it seems at least
- with the intention of backaracking

But she cannot escape the blanket of fog
GRACE seems to be running literally through nothingness

She stops once more to get her breath back”
In spite of herself she is unable to stifle the occasional moan of desperation

Suddenly a warm ray of sunlight reaches her In the distance a figure is outlined
against the light

The figure approaches slowly GRACE feels so helpless and disconcerted that she can ‘
only remain rooted to the spot
at

3
Vi

When the figure is barely a metre away GRACE lets out a groan of utter shock and
puts her hands to her mouth

The man about thirty five years of age is dressed in military uniform He carries a
knapsack on his back He is tall and slim with deep set eyes and cadaverous jaw He

has several scars and bruises on his face His expression ts sad and absent as ifhe had
lived through some terrible experience

GRACE

(almost breathless)
Charles

The man looks at her in silence without reacting as if he did not recognise her Then
his eyes widen a little

CHARLES
(stuttering)
Grace

They embrace slowly The knapsack falls to the ground

GRACE begins to cry

GRACE
(between sobs)
This can’t be true It’s not possible They told me you’d
been given up for deadthat you stepped on a mine and
were swallowed up by the earth

CHARLES takes some time to answer

CHARLES
(looking into space)
Theysay a lot of things

GRACE
(pressing herself even more closely to him)

Oh thank you Gad thank you Every night I’ve prayed
for this moment asking for the impossible begging God
to return my husband and the father of my children (She
pulls away from kim slightly and looks him in the eyes)
They don’t know anything I told them the war wasn’t
over yet and that one day you’d come back (Ske
embraces him again) And you have youre back youre
back Butwhere have you been all this time

CEARLES
Out therelooking for my house

GRACE runs her hand over his forenead ana tnrougn nis nair

GRACE
My God youre so diferent

CHARLES
Sometimes I bleed

GRACE is unable to stifle a burst of hysterical laughter They both smile looking ct
each other

Meanwhile a stiff breeze has swept the fog away among the trees making the road
visible once more

BERTHA leaves the room
CHARLES

CHARLES stops her with gesture e of his hand and moves to ‘the foot of ine siaircase
Then he begins to climb the stairs one by one like an old man of eighty

GRACE observes his slow ascent visibly moved though we do not know whether it is
out of joy or sadness at seeing him in such a lamentable state

79 THE HOUSE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM INTJDAY

ANNE and NICHOLAS are asleep

The door opens and the outline of their father appears
CHARLES
(whispering)

How are my little ones

ANNE is the first to open her eyes and see him She leaps from the bed and runs

towards him

ANNE
Daddy

CHARLES sweeps her up into his arms as she clings to his neck

ANNE
Why did you take so long

CHARLES looks at NICHOLAS The boys breathing is very staggered as if he were
Shivering with cold He stares fixedly at his father

CHARLES
Hello titch

80 THE HOUSE GRACE’S BEDROOM INTDAY

visibly moved almost in tears

GRACE
(whispering)
Forgive me Lord for ignoring your voice for not feeling

’ BERTHA opens a draw and carefully takes our a white tablecloth

BERTHA
And what aboutthat other matter

GRACE
Other matter (She stops sewing) Oh

For an instant GRACEs expression clouds over

BERTHA
(taking cutlery from a drawer)
Are you still thinking of going to see Father Lebrun

GRACE resumes her embroidery and the smile returns to her face

GRACE
You know I think just lately we’ve all let ourselves get
rather carried away This house would drive anyone mad
don’t you think so It’s so bigand so dark But now
my husband’s back things are going to change With him

BERTHA looks rather sceptical but finally agrees

GRACE goes rigid and glares at her daughter

eyes are open or closed
97 THE HOUSE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM INTDAY

ANNE has disobeyed her mother and is sitting on the floor making her two dolls dance
with each other in her hands

She is singing softly
98 THE HOUSE GRACE’S BEDROOM INTJDAY

GRACE with a sigh of resignation gives a last look at her husband lying motionless
on the bed and leaves the room

tiredness

ANNES humming
GRACE eet et ene

Humming
GRACE

Humming

GRACE stands and takes out the bunch of keys

GRACE
That girl

100THE HOUSE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM INTJDAY

GRACE enters the room

At the far side of the room by the light of an oil lamp we can make out the white form

of the girl as she sits with her back to us We can see only the dolls dancing in her
hands

GRACE
Anne what did I tell you about sitting on the floor
ANNE
But I’m on the carpet

GRACE

Tt makes no difference Youll still soil it Do you mind
telling me why you never do as you’re tol

Silence GRACE shows an expression of absolute terror

The hands which are playing with the dolls are long and bony At that moment we are

aware that the girls silhouette could be that of an older woman crouching in the

corner In fact the seams of the dress seem to be about to split Nevertheless ANNE’s
voice is unmistakable

GRACE walks slowly toward the figure

FIGURE
(with ANNE’s voice)
I didn’t know how to take it off

GRACE stands opposite the figure and for a moment seems to have been left breathless

by the shock

Benind the tulle of the veil we can just distinguish the drawn and wrinkled face of an old
woman with unseeing aves who continues singing with the girls voice

Tne old lady looks at her — or so it seems — and stops singing

OLD LADY
(with ANNEs voice) —
What’s the matter

GRACE with great difficulty manages to say something

GRACE
Where is my daughter

The old lady stares at her in silence Then she lets out a giggle
“ GRACE
What have you done with my daughter

The old lady suddenly hunches up hiding her face with her arm

OLD LADY
Don’t hit me don’t hit me(She turns her head like a
linle girl) Why are you mad I haven’t done anything
wrong

GRACE usters a ery of terror and fury and rushes at the old lady She also screams
GRACE drags her into a corner and rips the veil from her head

OLD LADY
(with a blood-curdling shout)
Mummyyyyyy
GRACE -

(beating and scratching her)
You’re not my daughter You’re not my daughter

The Communion dress is torn in several places

GRACE digs her nails into the old womans white hair and tries to tear it out

Suddenly we sze the reflection of their struggle in the mirror GRACE is horrified to
discover that it is her daughter she is grappling with She immediately releases her grip
and the girl runs into a corner

Just then BERTHA enters the room The girl throws her arms around her sobbing

BERTHA
Maam I heard shouts

GRACE says nothing She is unable to react as she tries to take in what has happened
aN

ANNE»
She wants to kill me She’s wicked (Looking at her
mother and screaming) Youre wicked Wicked

BERTHA
Anne dont say such things

ANNE
She won’t stop until she Kills us

BERTHA
Ssshhcalm down calm down

ANNE
She tried it once Sh won’t stop until she kills us

GRACE raises her hands to her mouth to stifle her crying

BERTHA takes the girl from the room

101 THE HOUSE KITCHEN INTDAY

GRACE is sitting with her arms folded

She has put the kettle on to boil The door opens and BERTHA appears

GRACE
(anxiously)
How is she

BERTHA
Ive never seen her like this before ma’am Theres no
calming her down I’ve left her with her father

GRACE gives her a surprised look
BERTHA
She insisted on talking to bim

BERTHA removes the kettle from the heat and pours some of the contents into a mug

BERTHA
What happened ma’am Why did you fight

GRACE
It wasn’t her It wasthat woman (She takes out of her
pocker the page of the colouring book which is now very
crumpled We see again the drawing of the grandmother)
The woman with the sightless eyes imitating my
daughters voice I’d swear to God that it wasn’t my

Silence

BERTHA does not reply She turns away and begins to put the pots and pans away

-daughter But all of a sudden (Ske closes her eyes and -

draws her hand across her forehead Sobbing) God help
me I don’t know whats the matter with me

BERTHA
You must get more rest madam (She places the mug and
a couple of tablets on the table in front af GRACE) You
can’t take on all the responsibility of this house Leave it

to us We know what has to be done Come now drink
this up

GRACE
Whats all this abouf-you knowing what has to be done
What did you mean by that

BERTHA
Nothing ma’am I was just suggesting that

GRACE
There’s nothing to suggest Who do you think you are
You have no idea what has to be done (Pause) Or do
you

GRACE
(almost to herself)
All this began when you people arrived

GRACE looks at the tablets beside the steaming mug

Silence

GRACE
What are these

BERTHA
(with ner back to her)
Tablets for your migraine ma’am The omes you always
take

GRACE
Go and see to the children please I need to be on my
own

Yes madam
BERTHA leavesthe kitchen

After staring for a considerable time at the tablets and the drink GRACE gets up and
washes them down the sink with the contents of the mug

C) 102THE HOUSE PASSAGE INTDAY

The door to GRACE’s bedroom opens and BERTHA and ANNE come out with the
Communion dress in tatters The girl shows signs of having been crying

GRACE watches them from the other end of the passage

BERTHA and the girl walk past her ANNE does not look at her mother

GRACE watches them walk away -

103THE HOUSE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM INTJDAY
ANNE lies on the bed clutching a pillow

NICHOLAS sits behind her

NICHOLAS
(whispering)
Anne Anne what happened

NICHOLAS looks disturbed as if some unpleasant memory had flashed into his mind

NICHOLAS

Pause

ANNE
The day she went mad

NICHOLAS lies on his bed with his back to ANNE

NICHOLAS
I don’t remember
ANNE
3 Ido She’s a liar

ANNE
Because she went mad again And she hates me

NICHOLAS
Don’t say that Mummy loves you
ANNE
She always thinks she’s right And if you disagree with

NICHOLAS turns over to face his sister

NICHOLAS
Why do you say that

ANNE
Nanny told me There are going to be changes
104THE HOUSE GRACE’S BEDROOM INTJDAY
GRACE enters and closes the door behind her

She leans back against the door

CHARLES is sitting on che bed He is wearing his soldiers uniform A faint light
filters through the closed shutters onto his back Hes looking down so we can hardly
see his face

Silence

CHARLES
Anne told me everything
GRACE looks ashamed She speaks slowly halfway between desperation and
exhaustion
GRACE
I wish I had an explanation but I havent At first I
thought there was someone else in the house even
thought there were ghosts
CHARLES
I’m not talking about the ghosts I’m talking about what
happened that day
Pause

GRACE

- TEs ae ae
Tell me it’s not tue Tell me the girlis lying -

GRACE
I don’t know what youre talking about
O
CHARLES
Tell me you didn’t do it
Long silence
GRACE knows what her husband is referring to She sobs and presses herself even
harder against the door
GRACE
(tearfully)
It happened three months agothe thought of it still keeps
me awakeAnd when I do manage to get to sleep I wake
up again in a sweat shouting (She calms down a little) I
told the servants to take the day off They never came
back I still don’t know why Have you eaten anything
Silence
rw CHARLES
XQ

Tell me what happened

ft is a while before GRACE speaks again And as she nears the moment of confession
she finds speaking more and more difficult

GRACE -

I told the children to get ready for their bath But they
didn’t take any notice There are days when they don’t
do what lask (She cries again and adopts a tone of self-
justification) I don’t know why they have so much
trouble understandingthat I give the orders around
here Because I’m their mother And you weren’t here
to help me Damn it Where were you

CHARLES does not reply He does not even move

GRACE
They laughed I threatened to take the belt to them like
you used to do But they didn’t care (Sarcasrically)
They thought ic was funny to see their mother trying to be
their fathertrying to restore order And the more I
shouted at them and hit them the more they laughedAt
me (Her legs weaken and she begins to slide down the
door tuntil she reaches the floor Her voice tremdles more

and more fading out) So put a pillow (sme)

reproduces the gesture with her hands) over their litle
headsso that theyd stop laughing

She cries bitterly for some time as if she had just received a thrashing CHARLES does
not appear to be moved

Little by little GRACE recovers her composure

GRACE
T almost dlled themMy God I almost killed them

CHARLES

(sadly)
So it’s true You did do it

GRACE
But nothing came of it It was just am accident

CHARLES

(coldly)
You did do it

GRACE -
You must forgive me Charles

CHARLES
It’s not me who must forgive you It’s the children

GRACE
T already talked to them and promised them Il never lay

a finger on them again They know I love them and that I
could never

CHARLES stands up With the light behind him his figure acquires a menacing air

GRACE
“What are you going to do

Pause

CHARLES
I came to say goodbye to my wife and children Now I
must go
GRACE
Go where
CHARLES
(abserntly)

Out there

ed

GRACE
But the wars over Youve no need to go

CHARLES

(with a psychotic look)
The war hasnt finished

GRACE
(standing up)
lutwhat the hell are you talking about Youre not

going anywhere do you hear me You left once already
(Pause) Why

GRACE goes over to the bed and slimps down staring into space

GRACE
Why did you have to go to that stupid war that had nothing
to do with us2 Why didn’t you do what the others did

CHARLES
The others surrendered

GRACE
We all surrendered There was nothing else we could do
This is a small island and it was crawling with Germans
damn it Is that so hard to accept (She slowly lies down
resting her head on the pillow) What were you trying to
prove by going to the front You were born here for
God’s sake Do you rememberdo you remember when
you told meI know a house in the middle of 2 meadow
No one will bother our children there And you brought us ©
to this cald cheerless place where I don’t even know who
‘ am because no one knows I exist And then you left
In this house we are all guilty of something

Suddenly GRA CE feels CHARLES’ ‘S lips ¢ on her neck He gently embraces her

They give each other a lang look

They kiss on the mouth and begin to undress Against all expectations GRACE shows a
sexual passion little in keeping with ner religious fervour

They make love

She stands motionless not knowing what to do

110THE HOUSE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM INTJDAY

A pale ghostly white light illuminates the children who are asleep in their beds
ANNE opens her eyes and sits up dazzled and puzzled

When she has stretched and is fully conscious of what is happening she lets out a
piercing scream her eyes glued on the window

LYDIA opens her mouth in an exaggerated way uttering a wordless gargie though we
do not know if it is out of fear or because she wants to say something

GRACE drags her toa table where there isa noteped and a pen

GRACE
Write it down Come on (She puts the pen in her hand)
Write

cleared up spontaneously How do you know they’re not
cured if you never expose them to the light

GRACE cannot believe her ears but is lost for an answer

TUTTLE
My sister-in-law used to get terrible attacks of rheumatism
in her legs and back Then one fine day(Long
pause)they disappeared

BERTHA

small and completely empty

123THE HOUSE UPPER STAIRCASE INTDAY

GRACE ts about to open yet another door when her attention is drawn by the last flight
of stairs which ts narrower than the rest

She climbs it slowly until she reaches a small door

She hunts through her bunch of keys
After a few seconds she tuts in annoyance

124THE HOUSE HALL —- STAIRCASE INTNIGHT’
GRACE still carrying the rifle runs down the stairs

BERTHA is standing there cuddling LYDIA who still shows signs of having cried The
two women and TUTILE calmly waiting downstairs appear to be expecting her

BERTHA does not seem to be intimidated She moves away from LYDIA and Looks at
TUTTLE

BERTHA

Mr Tuttle why don’t you tell the mistress what you
discovered this morning

The old man takes a few seconds to react as if he did not know what she was talking
about

TUTTLE —
Oh yes Ma’am do-you remember the graves you were
looking for Well I found them

GRACE
I don’t want to see any graves

BERTHA
You ought to see them madam Then youd see for
yourself(the tone of her voice is more sinister than
ever)that ghosts exist

GRACE
Ghosts do not exist

TUTTLE

(approaching GRACE)
Ob yes ma’am I assure you they doThey exist all

GRACE steps back For an instant she seems intimidated by her servants

GRACE

The children reach their mother who pushes them into the house

GRACE aims her rifle at the three figures

GRACE
Don’t come any closer One more step and Ill shoot

The servants keep walking

GRACE pushes the children back and grabs the sheets of paper tearing them and
throwing them into the air while the spiritualists shout in fear

Suddenly we see the same shot with the same framing but without GRACE and the

children in such a way that the sheets of paper seem to be being tarn and thrown in the
air of their own accord t

There follows a long silence The OLD WOMAN seems to come out of ‘her trance

One of the three men (Mr MARLISH) with long hair and a moustache exactly cs

ANNE had drawn him approaches the old lady

MR MARLISH

It’s quite clear that these beings don’t want us to live here

MR MARLISH
We hardly know anything about them yet

MRS MARLISH
Yes we do We know that the mother killed her two
children and then shot herself That’s quite enough

The group slowly disappears at the same time as GRACE and the children reappear
a hugging each other in a corner of the room

MRS MARLISH

importance of this phenomenon It’s not every day one is
able to make contact with a spirit

combing the house with your magnetophones and
ectoplasm gaugesbut not while we are inside

MRS MARLISH

Thank God for that I’m going to look in on Victor -
We hear the noise of chairs and (footsteps walking away
GRACE continues hugging her children

A long silence

GRACE

I tried to wake you up But you didn’t move I said to
myself It’s happened I’ve killed my own children I
put the rifle to my forehead and pressed the tigger But
nothing happened and instead of the shot I heard your
laughter in the bedroom (With a biter smile) You were
playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened And
I thanked the Lord over and over again for beimg so
merciful with our lives for giving usanother chance
But now now I don’t know what to think (sobs) Now I
don’t know what to think

BERTHA

The girl said the very same thing

GRACE and the children turn towards BERTHA standing ct the end of the passage

BERTHA
Then she went dumbforever (Pause Recovering her
servile tone) Maam shall I have breakfast prepared

GRACE and BERTHA look at each other without rencour GRACE nods

Sometimes well sense them and other times we wont
