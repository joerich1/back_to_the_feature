EXT DUTCH HARBOR - ALASKA - NIGHT

FROM ABOVE

Rugged snow-covered peaks tower over a tiny frontier town
and the largest fishery in the United Statesthe center of
crab operations for the Bering Sea - the wildest most
dangerous stretch of water in the world

CLOSER ON THE HARBOR

The 90 ships that make up the Bering Sea crab fleetmanned
by a rag tag navy of old salts ex-cons and family men
hellbent on making a fortune or dying in the process

It’s a flurry of activity as all the ships frantically gear
up for a long trip

CLOSE ON ONE OF THESE SHIPS - THE MAGGIE MAY

A BLINDING FLASH OF SPARKS cascades into ice-flecked water

REVEAL the sparks erupt from a welding torch on the deck of
the 200 FOOT CRAB FISHING SHIP

It’s an old rust-bucket that’s clearly seen better days Her
hull is an awkward patchwork of welded metal and fatigue

The Maggie May is tied to an ice-coated dock along with a
gaggle of other ships

A MASKED WELDER puts the finishing touches on the hydraulic
arm of a DECK-MOUNTED CRAB POT LAUNCHER

Beside the welder CLIFF BAYLISS (30s) the Maggie May’s
big bullish Deckboss works the controls of the ship’s CRANE
between the ship and

THE DOCK

Where a FUEL TRUCK is PUMPING DIESEL into the ship

Cliff has just picked up a pallet full of BAIT - lifting it
25 FEET OVER THE ACTIVITY

Hitching a ride on the pallet is DECKHAND PETE FRYE (late
20s wiry blond surfer-mellow)

Pete casually lights a smoke as he takes in the view

With a WHINE of hydraulics Cliff lowers the pallet to the
ship’s deck
ON THE SHIP’S DECK

Pete clambers off like a monkey unhooks the pallet beside
boxes upon boxes already on deck

Beyond the palletsA HUNDRED CRAB POTS (800l1b 6x6x2 steel
crab traps) are stacked like enormous legos loosely held
together by lengths of chain

These guys are nearing the end of a very long day prepping
the ship for battle

Pete steps onto the hook for the return trip to the dock

Cliff hits the controls has Pete ten feet over the dock
before he notices the lit cigarette

He shouts up to Pete

CLIFF
Knievel Put the smoke out

He looks pointedly at a FUEL TRUCK PUMPING DIESEL into the
ship just below Pete

PETE
Dude My last one

ON CLIFF as he smiles enigmatically -
CLIFF
(sotto)
No problem Petey
Cliff abruptly switches up on the controls -

THE CRANE ABRUPTLY CHANGES DIRECTION - sending captive Pete
back over the deck

PETE
Cliff Dude

And Pete is suddenly hanging over the icy dark water on the
other side of the ship

Cliff lowers him towards the wateronly feet belowyet
the guy is mellow as ever

CREWS OF NEARBY CRAB SHIPS CAT-CALL at Pete’s expense

PETE (CONTD)
This shit isn’t funny

Cliff chuckles to himself as Pete’s boots touch water
Pete finally gets some life as he tries to climb the cable
like a catcigarette still hanging from his mouth

VOICE (OS)
Hey We got no time for you to be
artistic bud

Reveal CAPTAIN BEN LARSEN (early 30’s) coming out of the
deckhouse A control freak with a perpetual frown - Ben leads
his men into battle with the toughest of love

He shouts to the oblivious Welder as he checks his watch

BEN
It’s nine Gotta be outta here by
midnight Where’re you at

WELDER
About done -

Ben finally looks up to the crane - follows the arm to Pete
dangling over the watersmoke still in his mouth

BEN
Cliff For chrissakes be a
Deckboss

Pete overhears the exchange puffs contentedly as Cliff
sullenly gets to work pulling him back to the ship

BEN (CONT’D)
Pete Put the fucking smoke out

Cliff flips Pete the bird as the deckhand dejectedly tosses
his smoke to the water

The Welder checks a list as Ben turns back to him

WELDER
--got your saltwater
pumpscranepropeller shaft
All that’s left is those deck
cleats

He uses his boot to tap a RUSTED FATIGUED METAL CLEAT set
into the deck beside the tall stack of potsalready
creaking under the chains

BEN
Will they last through this trip

WELDER
Sureyeah I mean -
BEN
Then we skip it Can’t load my pots
with you working on the cleats
Just invoice me okay -

WELDER
You still owe me from the last two -

BEN
You’1ll get your money

EXT DOCK - SAME

A PICKUP TRUCK pulls to a stop beside the ship

NATE LARSEN (mid 30s) gets out of the bed retrieves a
stuffed army GREEN DUFFEL Only a few years older than Ben

but could pass for an uncle The world has not been kind to
Nate

He waves to the NATIVE ALEUT DRIVER as the truck drives off
He absorbs the frenzy on the dock and the ship with a smile
He looks pointedly at a small FAMILY CREST an intricate
design built around the letter ‘L’ painted above the

wheelhouse windows

The paint is faded and cracking but it’s still there

EXT SHIP’S DECK - A MOMENT LATER
Nate climbs from the dock to the deck He watches Cliff
operate the crane for a moment before he drops his duffel to
the planks getting Cliff’s and Pete’s attention
CLIFF
Well look what the cat heaved up
Pete take over for a minute

Pete ignores Nate’s outstretched hand

PETE
When’d you get out

NATE
A while ago man -

But Pete doesn’t care he’s already turned his back as

Cliff leaves the controls moves to Nate
Nate reaches out to shake Cliff’s handCliff grabs it

NATE (CONTD)
You smell like bait -

Cliff PUNCHES Nate in the stomach - dropping him
Pete nods with approval from behind the controls
Nate doubles over as Cliff waits for a response
There’s a brief flash in Nate’s eyes but he remains Zen

NATE (CONT’D)
Good to see you too

CLIFF
Thought Ben was high when he said
youd be on this trip

CLIFF (CONTD)
I ain’t your junior no more I’m
Deckboss now You fuck around with
me I’1l throw you in the bait
chopper

NATE
Past is the past

Cliffs skeptical Ben approaches

BEN
We’re running late

NATE
Missed you at the airport -

Ben doesn’t stop moving as he checks the Welder’s work on the
pot launcher

BEN
Didn’t have the time Too many
repairs too much to take care of

Nate follows him across the deck

NATE
All you had to do was tell me

BEN
Fuck me if I’m gonna have to hear
this pity-party for a month on the
water
Nate’s thrown off by the sudden hostility

BEN (CONTD)
You got to town like every other
deckhand

(beat)
Where the fuck is Brady

CLIFF
Meeting us at the bar

Ben looks at the progress on the shipmostly done - only a
few pots left on the deck

OTHER CREWS are getting in trucks and cars heading off the
dock and back into town

BEN
Fuel topped off

CLIFF
Yep

Ben checks his watch whistles to Pete to take a break

BEN
Fuck it To the bar

EXT DOCK - A MOMENT LATER
Ben Pete Cliff and Nate approach Ben’s pick up -

CHET GRIGGS (early 20’s) earrings and goatee sits on his
army duffel bag nearby a wool beanie pulled tight over his
head He’s got the gaunt hopeful look of the starving and
desperate

BEN
I told you we’re crewed up Try the
other captains -

GRIGGS
I did

BEN
Well then you’re fucked

Pete shakes his head at the poor kid as he shuffles down the
dockobviously freezing his ass off

PETE
The less jobs there are the more
retards show up
Cliff moves to get in the truck with Pete and Ben nearly
forcing Nate into the open-air bed

BEN
Cliff Ride in back

Cliff gives Nate a look of death climbs into the bed

CUT TO

EXT BEN’S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Cliff is bundled up in the bed freezing his ass off and
grumbling to himself

INT BEN’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Tense silence as Ben drives Nate sits on the passenger side
with Pete stuck in between

PETE
You best be on your game this time
(to Ben)

And he sure as shit better not be
anywhere near the helm

He takes a drag off a cigaretteHE’S MISSING A FINGER

PETE (CONT’D)
Fingers don’t grow back asshole

He blows the smoke in Nate’s face

CUT TO

INT EAGLE’S ROOST - CONTINUOUS

T REX’S ‘CADILLAC’ BLARING from an ancient jukebox in the
seedy fisherman’s bara triple-wide trailer on blocks

The place is jammed to the flocked ceiling with rowdy drunk
crewmen blowing their hard-earned cash the night before their
month-long battle with the Bering

Linoleum fishing relics and photos prefab wood-panelling
it has the charm of an elk’s lodge circa ‘72

The only women in the bar are WAITRESSES kept busy either
slapping groping hands away or collecting huge tips as they
deftly maneuver with trays of drinks
AT THE BAR

The eye of the hurricanea GROUP OF OLDER CAPTAINS AND
DECKHANDS (40’s50’s) sit perched on the stools

Among them DANNY MONTOYA (early 30’s) He’s gaunt and
unshaven looks like he hasn’t slept or showered in weeks

The men chain-smoke watching the end of the bar with
fascinationa pile of money between them

AT THE END OF THE BAR - the main attraction

SOL HAVERSHAM (50s) wild-eyed and grizzled (and clearly
plastered) sloooowly works his ‘magic’ on BONNIE (40s) The
BARTENDER

A menthol dangles from her lips as she watches Sol struggle
to produce his lighter Drunk or sober everything Sol does

is slow and considered

Bonnie impatiently rolls her eyes towards the men down the
bar - a silent pleathey barely contain their laughter

Sol balances on his stool as he finally slowly pulls his
Zippo from a shirt pocketit’s excruciating

He winks ‘smoothly’ as he tries to spark a flame for her

BONNIE
Get it up big boy I got faith

A YOUNG DECKHAND passes by sees her dangling cigarette -
SPARKS A LIGHTER

She gives a look of warning to the kid who looks down the
polished oak TO SIX ANGRY GLARES STARING HIM DOWN

The Young Deckhand sheepishly disappears into the crowd as
Sol finally gets a SPARK

Bonnie uses her lips to angle it towards the flame - trying
to help him along

Montoya is nervously biting his nails to the quick

MONTOYA
Don’t you dare move those lips

Sol finally gets within centimetersSLOOOWWWLY closing in

Every one of the men is raptLEANING in anticipation
AND HE FINALLY CONNECTS

MONTOYA (CONTD)
GODDAMMIT SOL

GROANS from everyone except TWO MEN at the other end of the
bar - who receive the pile of crumpled cash

Bonnie takes a satisfying drag off her smoke as she winks at
Sol - moves to the winners circle hand held out

They grudgingly give her a share of the winnings
As Sol falls off his stool
ACROSS THE BAR the door opens

REVEALING Cliff Pete and Benreluctantly followed by Nate
He knows this place well and has no desire to be back

The guys get the familiar greetings from the OTHER
CREWSeven Nate who gets some surprised looks - some
people had no desire to see him back either

The group wades to the bar where Montoya slaps down every
denomination of the dollar to settle his debt

Ben signals Bonnie as he helps Sol to his feet

BEN
Three Wise Men

Cliff and Pete whoop it up

BEN (CONTD)
(to the guys)
We’re back at the dock in an hour
No bullshit
(re Sol)
Pot of coffee for the old man
Bonnie

Sol lays eyes on Nate reacts as only Tommy Chong can

soL
Oh Hey Nate

He gives Nate a sloppy hug
Montoya turns at the mention of Nate
MONTOYA

Holy shit I heard it but didn’t
believe it Welcome back man

He claps Nate on the shoulder It’s the friendliest greeting
Nate’s gotten so far

NATE
Thanks Montoya -

MONTOYA
You got ten bucks I can borrow

He indicates the pile of wadded cash on the bar and the
ANNOYED CAPTAIN waiting for Montoya

NATE
Nothing changes around here

soL
Fuck no it doesn’t

Nate reaches for his wallet

Bonnie pours a row of shots for the guysupends three
bottles into each glassBeam Daniels and Cuervo

Each man grabs his glass except Nate Cliff nudges him

CLIFF
Pick it up

NATE
I can’t Would you make mine a
Coke Bonnie —
Cliff stops Bonnie with a hand
CLIFF
Fuck the steps You don’t drink the
booze it’s bad juju
The crew stares him downincluding Ben
Nate finally picks up the glass as Ben’s CELL GOES OFF
He checks the CALLER IDsets his glass down

BEN
Just a minute

They collectively groan as Ben hustles outside

CLIFF
Chicks man

EXT THE ROOST - A MOMENT LATER

Ben paces in the freezing cold and relative quiet of the
parking lot phone pressed to ear

He speaks with patience and tendernessmuch different than
he is with the crew

BEN
(into phone)
Yeah Nate made it in
(listens)
No It’ll be fine as long he keeps
his mouth shut

He abruptly changes the subject

BEN (CONT’D)
She feeling better Temperature
gone down
(beat)
Good good

He winces as he listens - turns emotional for an instant

BEN (CONTD)
I knowI love you too You stay
warm and I’1ll see you before you
know it -

Blinding HIGH BEAMS as a truck pulls into the gravel lot

BRADY WILTON (early 20s - small wiry and scrappy) storms
from the passenger side slams the door - cutting off a
SCREAMING TIRADE from his GIRLFRIEND the driver

BRADY
Fucking twat

He reaches into the bed of the truck pulls out his duffel
and kicks the car for good measure as she POUNDS THE HORN and
fishtails away PEPPERING him and Ben with gravel

Ben calmly goes back to his conversation - he wipes the dew
from his eyes as we see him go back to ‘Coach Ben’ Can’t let
the guys see you cry

BEN
Yeah honey Brady just got here
(beat)
I love you too Bye

He hangs up as Brady walks towards him

BEN (CONTD)
You alright

BRADY
Im fucked

He shows Ben his handso swollen he can’t wear a glove
Ben instinctively grabs him around the neck
BEN

That better not be from Sue’s face
you piece of shit -

BRADY
Fuck no You know I wouldn’t do
that
(sheepish)

I punched the fucking door

Ben lets him go - mind spinning at the idea of being one man
down so close to the start time

BEN
Jesus H

BRADY
I swear I’m good to go -

BEN
Bullshit

Brady pleads
BRADY
We’1ll be out on our asses if I

don’t come back with a cut

Ben shakes his head thinking it through

INT THE ROOST - MOMENTS LATER
Ben and Brady rejoin the assembled crew at the bar

All raise their glasses as Ben and the men give the required
and oft repeated toast

BEN
As dad used to say

BEN AND CREW
Times are hard
Wages are small

(MORE)

BEN AND CREW (CONTD)
Drink more whiskey
Fuck ‘em all

The men slam their shotsand Nate’s eyes are drawn to
Brady’s swollen hand

He trades a look with Ben Ben’s eyes are clear ‘it’s not
your problem’ Ben’s in charge

CUT TO

EXT DUTCH HARBOR - NIGHT

Snow falls on the harbor as a fierce wind whips up a chop
DOZENS OF FISHING VESSELS of various sizes stream out of the
bay for the start of the season headed into the open water
of the Bering Sea - toward the crab grounds

A distant last in the long line of ships is the newly
repaired MAGGIE MAY breaking the white-caps at top speed
EXT MAIN DECK

The light snow is blown horizontal by the wind as they head
towards open waterwhere the seas are rougher as well

Nate is running the blocks of frozen bait through the BAIT
CHOPPER - a huge meat grinder while -

Pete and Cliff double check the chains securing the pots

Montoya coils and secures one of the thick ropes that had
tied the ship off to the dock

Griggs the hopeful greenhorn watches Montoya trying to
learn but is more focused on keeping his balance as the ship
crashes through the rough waters

He staggers sideways gripping the bulwark for support

Montoya smirks at Griggs who’s already sliding on
accumulating deck ice

MONTOYA
Lucky for you Brady fucked up his
hand

Montoya looks to the water ahead where a lit BUOY MARKER bobs
violently in the waves

MONTOYA (CONTD)
Bad luck for all of us if we don’t
make that buoy pronto

GRIGGS
Why

PETE
Midnight is Friday No one leaves
Dutch on a Friday Bad luck

Griggs isn’t sure if they’re fucking with him or not

GRIGGS
So we’ll just turn around right

MONTOYA
Up to the cap’n But if we do I’m
gonna kick Brady’s ass

CUT TO

INT WHEELHOUSE

Ben at the helm Brady close by - a fresh cast on his injured
handalready graffiti’d to look like a crab claw

He anxiously looks at the buoy marker in the water ahead
then back to the mounted digital clock that reads 1157

BRADY
C’mon c’mon

Ben guns the ship past the buoy marker just before
The clock marks 1200
Brady sighs raising his cast in prayer

BRADY (CONTD)
Thank Fucking God

Ben smiles doesn’t slow as he speeds away from Dutch

EXT MAGGIE MAY - MAIN DECK

The crew watches the marker buoy fly past - they all look up
to the wheelhouse

Ben gives the thumbs up through the glass

The men HOOT and HOLLER
MONTOYA

Gonna be a damn lucky trip I feel
it in my bones

EXT DUTCH HARBOR - FROM ABOVE

Instead of following the rest of the fleet north the Maggie
May makes a hard turn left cruises to the west

ON THE MAIN DECK
Nate watches the rest of the fleet moving away -

NATE
Where the fuck is Ben taking us

CLIFF
Some secret spot your Dad had

NATE
You fucking kidding That’s Russia
Only time Dad ever went out there
was on a bet

Cliff smiles

CLIFF
Virgin fishing man
NATE
Illegal fishing Cliff Those
Russians don’t screw around We’1l1
be lucky if they don’t blow our
ship out of the water on sight
CLIFF
Whatever man Captain’s decision
And you ain’t captain
Cliff whistles with glee as he walks away

CUT TO

EXT MAIN DECK - DAY
CHYRON ‘TWO WEEKS LATER’

A clear day but dark clouds approach on the horizonand
with it - turbulent water

WAVES SWELL and CRASH against the faded blue hull covering
the Maggie May in WHITE EXPLOSIONS of freezing spray

A thick crust of ice coats the rigging and bulwarks
dangling hundred pound icicles over the crew’s heads

Except for Ben and Brady all hands are on deck in orange
hooded slickers gloves and galoshes grinding through

Longer beards bags under eyes these guys haven’t bathed or
slept in days - they’re running on empty

Griggs staggers toward the side rail grips it for support
and hangs his head overboardfor the umpteenth time

Next to the pot launcher Pete coils some rope while Montoya
readies a small grappling hook attached to another line of
rope

PETE
Where’s that newbie enthusiasm
Thought you’d have sea legs by now

Griggs says nothing clings to the rail

Pete looks to the horizon where ominous dark clouds are
rolling in

PETE (CONTD)
You think this has been snotty
Last couple weeks have been a
pleasure cruise

Montoya points Griggs towards the horizon

MONTOYA
See those clouds in the distance
Aleutian Gray That means fifteen
twenty foot swells comin’ our way
(beat)
So get off my rail and get back to
the bait before it gets worse

He pulls Griggs off the rail and shoves him towards the BAIT
TROUGH under the wheelhouse

The kid fights more dry-heaves as Montoya expertly hurls the
heavy hook over the rail into -

THE FREEZING WATER

The hook snags a length of rope draped between two
FLUORESCENT BUOYS bobbing between rolling swells

Montoya swiftly uses the line to pull the hook rapidly grabs
the rope hand over hand as the ship motors past the buoys

He attaches the buoy line to a MOTOR-DRIVEN WINCH beside the
pot launcher at the rail

Rubber wheels snag the length of rope quickly reels it in
then coils the rope into a container beneath the wheels

The TWO BRIGHTLY COLORED BUOYS pop over the rail with the end
of the rope and the line GOES TAUT as a heavy CRAB POT
begins to peek from the water

BESIDE MONTOYA Sol operates the hydraulic CRANE CONTROLS He
swings the long crane arm into position above the pot

Montoya attaches a hook dangling from the crane to the pot
and Sol raises the crane arm

MONTOYA (CONTD)
Our luck’s gotta change I’m
bettin’ two-fifty Who’s in

CLIFF
You broke fuck What are you
bettin’ with Your boots

NATE
Be happy if we get a hundred All
we need is a hundred per pot for
the next two weeks and we’1ll be on
track

All watch in anticipation as the 800-pound steel pot is
slowly hoisted out of the sea and hauled over the bulwark

CLIFF
C’mon baby No whammiesno
whammies

The dripping pot is finally lifted into view

IT’S EMPTY except for a couple of crabs some trash fish
and the dangling bait bag

Montoya grunts annoyed

CLIFF (CONTD)
This ship is fucking cursed

MONTOYA
I blame Nate

Sol lowers the crane while Nate and Cliff carefully guide
the heavy pot into position on the launching platform

NATE

Blame your captain He’s the one
who’s dropped a hundred pots
illegally in Russian waters and
wont fucking leave

(shakes his head)
All our eggs in one basket even
with the ice pack knockin’ on our
door

The pot bangs heavily against the bulwark before thudding
onto a slanted launching platform rail-side

Sol flips a lever triggering hydraulic clamps on the
platform - LOCKING THE HEAVY POT TO THE PLATFORM so that it
doesn’t slip off and crush the men

Cliff swings open a gate on the bottom of the pot A half-
dozen fish fall into the sorting table in the center of the
deck The fish flopping around wildly

MONTOYA
I think Benny may also have
confused herring season with opi’s

Pete throws the fish overboard where waiting GULLS and TERNS
battle over the free lunch

Nate carries the two spindly Opilio crabs to the center of
the deck drops them through a LARGE OPEN HOLE into the WATER-
FILLED CRAB TANK

He looks up to - THE WHEELHOUSE WINDOWS - where Ben peers
through the window onto the deck just below

Nate holds up two fingers
NATE
There’s two for ya bud
INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Ben stands next to his captain’s chair in a cockpit of
COMPUTER MONITORS RADIOS and a HARDWIRED SATELLITE PHONE

mounted beside it all

His body is tense with frustration as he smokes a cigarette
down to its nub

He looks like shit Twice as bad as the crewmen

Ben grinds the smoke out in a Red Bull can overfilled with
butts

He looks out the window at Nate signalling below grabs a
radio mic connected to the main deck’s PA system

BEN
(into mic)

I can count it from here you
retarded fuck

BELOW - ON DECK Nate turns his two-finger signal into TWO
MIDDLE FINGERS

Ben marks the count in the LOG BOOK

CLOSE ON THE LOG BOOK - only single digit numbers for weeks
Theyve been struggling to find the crab

BELOW - ON DECK Cliff remains by the empty pot looking up
to Ben asking for direction with an exaggerated shrug

BEN (CONTD)

(into mic)
Stack it with the rest We’1ll
finish pulling up the pots on this
string and move on

Ben SLAMS THE MIC DOWN then turns to a monitor displaying a
topographic map of the Bering Sea

He lifts his cap and scratches his head in frustration
stares at the cryptic lines searching for inspiration
EXT MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

The men continue their work in the freezing sprayas Ben
shouts a warning from the PA system

BEN (0S)
Duck

The men pause and duck as a HUGE WALL OF WATER washes over
Griggs is too slow His legs whisk out from under him

He SKIDS across deck with the water GRABS HOLD OF THE
SORTING TABLE - saves himself from a concussionand
possibly being washed over

As the water recedesLAUGHTER ERUPTS behind him

He turns to find Cliff watching him with glee

Griggs is slow to get up

CLIFF
Suck it up Skidmark

Griggs gets up staggers back to Cliff and the pot

REVEALING SKIDMARK written in sharpie across his back - his
new nickname

CLIFF (CONTD)
Bait bag’s waiting and so are we

Griggs climbs into the open pot reaches toward the dangling
bait He moves slowly fumbles to unhook it

Cliff grows more impatient

CLIFF (CONTD)
You making out with it Let’s go

Griggs finally unhooks the bait wriggles out of the pot
CLIFF (CONTD)
You got one job right now Bait

That’s it Shouldn’t be that hard

Griggs stares back at Cliff a beat anger burning Cliff
squares off with him

CLIFF (CONTD)
Yes

Griggs backs off heads toward the bait trough as

Sol lifts the empty pot with the crane Cliff and Nate guide
it to the mostly empty stack of twenty already stacked near
the front of the ship

Griggs is visibly upset by Cliffs abuse Pete approaches

PETE
Don’t mind those assholes

Griggs’ anger subsides as he takes this in
PETE (CONTD)
Better a nickname than goin’ for a
swim

Pete winks and gets back to work clearing the sorting table

A SWELL ROCKS THE SHIP shakes the pot from Nate and Cliffs
grip

Sleep-deprived Sol is slow to react as Nate drops to the
deck ducking as the heavy pot swings loose on the crane arm
IT BANGS INTO THE STACK hard enough to squash him like a
bug

NATE
Whoa -

He looks to Sol who looks nearly as scared

soL
You okay

Nate gets up shoots Sol a dirty look

CUT TO

INT SHIP’S GALLEY - LATER

BELOW DECK a cramped kitchenette with the basic amenities of
an RV Latched wooden cabinets and shelves with braces jammed
with cans and cans of tuna

The cans of food and utensils SLIDE and CLANG behind the
braces as the ship does acrobatics in the worsening weather

Brady clumsily prepares a line of TUNA SANDWICHES his
plaster cast is covered in graffitiand SMEARED with food

It’s amazing that the guy can even prepare food as the floor
continuously drops and comes up againmuch less one-handed

Nearby Nate Cliff Sol and Montoya sit in a vinyl u-shaped
booth around a formica galley table

Everyone is fine with the motion in the ocean

Stripped of their orange weather gear they lounge in sweat-
soaked thermals and flannel casually brace their cups of
coffee as the ship rides the steep swells

They’re exhausted and ravenous

CLIFF
Let’s go Starving over here

NATE
Youre not sick of this shit yet

Brady drops the plate of sandwiches on the table

Montoya stares at the unappetizing food

MONTOYA
Hmmmthe Sue Special

BRADY
Shut your trap

MONTOYA
What man That’s what I hear Your
girlfriend’s got the best fish
tacos around

Cliff starts laughing spitting up chunks of tuna Nate
avoids the sight

BRADY
Fuck you both

Nate reaches for a sandwich sniffs it with distaste

NATE
Smells like the bait box

BRADY
Better get used to it We’re out of
everything else We’1l be eating
tuna sandwiches grilled tuna
patties tuna on toast

Montoya tries to shrug it off reaches for a sandwich
Sol indifferently takes a bite of his sandwich

soL
Nothing wrong with tuna

BRADY
Right You assholes bought the
first thing you saw so you could go
get wasted while we were prepping
to leave

Cliff is relishing his sandwich
CLIFF
Don’t see what the problem is

Were fishermen

Ben interrupts the moment as he exits the head (restroom)
shakes his head at Brady’s pile of opened tuna cans

PETE
You hungry You can have mine

Ben reaches for the coffee pot instead

BEN
I’m fine
(beat)
I’ll relieve Griggs from the helm
and then we’re back on the crab

NATE
I’m sure I’m not the only one that
could use a siesta Even a short

one -
BEN

This is a dinner break no time for

sleep

Exhausted GROANS all around
BEN (CONTD)
Storm’s moving in Gotta get the
rest of the gear up before we lose
it under the ice-pack
Montoya starts to protest but Ben is faster

BEN (CONT’D)
Eat Then back on deck

NATE
It’s been twenty hours straight -

Ben ignores him He retreats up the stairs to the wheelhouse
Nate looks to the rest of the guys who offer him no back up
Montoya grumbles
MONTOYA
Shit if that’s how it is then I’m

gonna eat slooowly

Nate scoots from the booth follows Ben upstairs

INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Griggs sits in the captain’s chair His body is rigid and
eyes wide as he keeps a white-knuckle grip on the JOG LEVER
and STEERING CONTROLS

It’s his turn on watch and he’s not comfortable with it to
say the least

Ben comes up the stairs behind him shakes his head at
Griggs’ anxiety

BEN
No need to be so fucking tense
You’re doing fine

He observes Griggs for a moment satisfied with what he sees

Griggs doesn’t take his eyes from the water Still tense as
he pushes the jog lever forward a notch bow pointed into a
large wave

BEN (CONTD)
Good Always keep her pointed into
the swells

(re the rough water)
This shit’s cake you got the easy
shift

Griggs nods gratefully as Ben resumes control

BEN (CONTD)

Get downstairs and eat before it’s
gone Need you back on deck in
five

Griggs moves to leave makes way as Nate enters
Griggs notes the tense exchange as he heads down the stairs
Nate hovers uncomfortably at the stairwell as

Ben retakes his seat at the helm SLEET and SPRAY lash the
windows as the seas worsen outside

REVEAL three computer flat-screens that Ben begins checking

ON ONE SCREEN - SONAR DATA and corresponding graphics to
indicate the vast underwater topography of the Bering Sea
fishing grounds

ONE ANOTHER SCREEN - shows the RADAR DISPLAY for miles
aroundthe comparably tiny ship in the FAR NORTHWESTvery
close to Russia

AN OVERLAID RED DOTTED LINE nearly vertical cuts through
the map just to the east of their position This is both the
International Dateline and this far north the maritime
border between Russia and the United States

Our guys are firmly in Russian waters
ON ANOTHER SCREEN - A WEATHER MAP to the north - A GIANT

MOVING MASS OF ODD-SHAPED BLOCKSlike a broken wall of
bricks
It’s the ice pack moving down from the Arctic Circle
Even more bad weather is clearly on the way

BEN (CONT’D)
What the fuck do you want Nate

NATE
We shouldn’t have dropped pots
anywhere this far west We haven’t
even seen any Russian ships out
here

Ben’s in no mood

BEN
Just thought we’d get some luck
for once -

NATE

Besides being dangerous why’d you
think Dad hadn’t been here since
ninety-one

BEN

Fine I take the blame

(beat)
Doesn’t matter anyway We still
need to pick up those pots or we’1ll
have the ice bustin’ buoys left and
right And if we lose that gear I
don’t have sixty fucking grand to
replace it Do you

Nate’s silent as Ben chain lights another smoke

NATE
We need sleep We’re worn out
getting sloppy Sol almost popped
my head like a grape -

BEN
Youve forgotten what it’s like to
pull a long shift

NATE
Bullshit It ain’t fair to drive us
hard because of your fuck up

BEN
I’m doing what I need to keep us in
business -

NATE
There’s gonna be a bad accident

BEN
I don’t need you telling me about
accidents Nathan

NATE
This won’t be your wheelhouse for
much longer -

BEN
Get out of my wheelhouse

NATE
The bank’s been sending letters to
Ma They want to repo the fucking
ship

BEN
I’ve already talked to the bank
I’ve worked it out She doesn’t
have to worry -

NATE
Really She talked to them too

BEN
I said I worked it out Back off

NATE
She doesn’t trust you She wants me
in the mix

BEN
Fuck you
(beat)
All you had to do was stay home
Wait for your checks Blow it on
booze blow - I don’t give a shit

NATE
I own as much of this business as
you and it’s dying

Ben shakes his head at him

BEN
All that garbage you put Mom and
Dad through Can’t just jump in
and be the swingin’ dick now
Nathan You lost your shot

NATE
Past is the past Ben

Ben doesn’t bother looking up from his computer screen as
Nate leaves frustrated and unheard by his younger brother

INT GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Griggs sits with the men as they shovel food in their maws -
desperate for the protein

Nate angrily bounds down the stairs doesn’t bother even
looking at the crew as he heads for the equipment room

Montoya chuckles under his breath

CLIFF
And big bro gets put in his place

GRIGGS
What’s the deal You guys all treat
Nate like shit

PETE
He’s a fuck up -

CLIFF
Just like you Griggs

Sol shakes his head at the turn of conversation

SOL
You’re a bunch of teenage girls

Cliff ignores Sol
CLIFF
Asshole fell asleep at the wheel

filling in for his daddy Rolled

GRIGGS
No shit

CLIFF

Montoya crosses himself

PETE
And my fucking finger

CLIFF
I don’t trust him

MONTOYA
Bad mojo for sure

Griggs doesn’t look too happy with the new info
SOL
Fuck you and your mojo I’ve known

the Larsen kids longer than youve
been diddling your wee peckers

Sol looks to Griggs
SOL (CONTD)
Ever a man you wanted watching your
back at sea it’s Nate Poor guy
was in the wrong place at the wrong
time Nothing more It’s fishing
It’s dangerous

The men are silent as Sol gets up from the table

INT WHEELHOUSE - SAME

OUTSIDE BEN’S WINDOW - The swells have gotten worse Freezing
rain and sleet coming down harder Bad things are brewin’

But Ben isn’t focussing on that

Instead his eyes are glued to his monitor He brings up a
new map on the screen

A RADIO SUDDENLY COMES TO LIFE WITH A ‘VHF’ BROADCAST —-

AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE (0S)
WEATHER ALERT

It’s a modulated text-to-voice weather-bot from the National
Weather Service

AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
TO-NIGHT THROUGH TO-MORROW SEVERE
STORM WARNING ICING CONDITIONS -

Ben turns the broadcast down as he gets back to steering his
ROCKING AND ROLLING ship

CUT TO

EXT BERING SEA - LATER

The storm bears down with full-force Clouds of thick snow
and spray descend on the Maggie May as it PLOWS through white
caps hunting for its last few precious and most likely empty
pots

BRIGHT ORANGE SODIUM LIGHTS attempt to create some visibility
in the near white-outcreating a surreal ORANGE CURTAIN OF
SNOW cutting across the deck

ICE covers every surface of the ship It’s like alien
terrain

BARELY VISIBLE IN THE DISTANCEthe field of broken rapidly
solidifying ice rolls slowly and ominously in the rough seas

Time’s running out

EXT SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

The crew continues the monotonous grind hauling the empty
pots from the churning water like Zombies on autopilot

Despite the conditions the exhaustion has gotten them in a
kind of rhythm as they slip and slide on their sea legs
EXT WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

No longer needed as bait boy Griggs now chops at the ice
covering the TOP OF THE WHEELHOUSE with an axegetting
perilously close to the edge - FIVE STORIES ABOVE THE WATER
Griggs slips on his ass luckily grabs the wire-railing to
steady himself

EXT MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

Cliff watches Griggs shaking his head at the greenhorn’s
perceived ineptitude

EXT WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Griggs moves closer to a THERMOS-SIZED YELLOW canister on the
edge of the roof - COATED WITH ICE

IT’S AN EPIRB Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon As
soon as it leaves its cradle it emits a signal to the Coast
Guard for rescue

Griggs swings the axe over his head to smite the ice around
the EPIRB -

EXT MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS
Cliff panics at the sight He SCREAMS up to the greenhorn

CLIFF
What the fuck are you doing

Griggs doesn’t hear himSLIPS once again on the ice -
stalling his axe strike

Cliff runs for the wheelhouse
AT THE HYDRAULICS

A cigarette hangs loosely from Sol’s mouth as he guides the
latest empty pot positioning it above

A STACK OF POTS NOW THREE-STORIES ABOVE THE ROLLING DECK
nearly obscuring the bow from view

Where Nate stands fearlessly guiding the 800 lb pot to rest
without even a life-vest or safety-linehe relies on his
legs to absorb the rolling waves CRASHING into the Maggie
May below

Nate moves away from the SWINGING POT as the SHIP DIPS into a
huge trough between thirty-foot waves

Nate goes to all fours for stability watches with excitement
as he gets a bird’s eye view of the WATER SWAMPING THE BOW

EXT WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS
Cliff appears at the top of the ladder

CLIFF
Griggs Goddammit

Griggs is surprised as Cliff pulls the axe from his hands and
points to the EPIRB

CLIFF (CONTD)
That thing leaves the roof our
Coast Guard will start trying to
search and rescue our asses and
everyone will know we’re in illegal
waters

He shoves Griggs towards the ladder

CLIFF (CONTD)
You’re done up here Move
Ben’s voice BOOMS from the PA System

BEN (0S)
Big one Watch it

Cliff and Griggs brace themselves in the face of the five
story white water

EXT STACK - CONTINUOUS

The Maggie May crests the wave like a roller coaster coming
down at a near 45 degree anglegiving Nate a momentary
panoramic view of the surrounding sea It’s both beautiful
and frightening

Nate’s eyes widen as he sees a glimpse of something

OUT IN THE OPEN WATERa glimpse of A BRIGHT ORANGE LIFE
RAFT briefly illuminated by A WEAK FLASHING BEACON

The Maggie May evens outerasing the object from sight

The pot starts moving again as Sol gets back to work with the
crane hydraulics oblivious

Nate starts waving frantically from his perch -
NATE
Man overboard Man overboard

Cliff notices that Nate isn’t assistingcan’t hear what
he’s screaming over the DIN OF ENGINES WEATHER AND WAVES

CLIFF
Awwww come on What the fuck is
wrong with him
ON THE MAIN DECK
Pete Sol and Montoya also pause to look up to Natewho
scrambles off the stack like a monkey
INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ben rips open a fresh pack of cigaretteshis hair and hat
askew - as he notices that work has halted

and looks out his window at Nate scrambling to the deck
He gets on the PA System -

BEN
(into mic)
We got buoys comin’ up What the
hell are you doing

THROUGH HIS WINDOW - Nate is POINTING into the distant water
ahead of the ship still SCREAMING

BEN (CONT’D)
For fuck’s sake

Ben opens the door steps out into the driving sleet onto
the CATWALK extending from the wheelhouse to hear Nate

EXT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Ben calls out over the wind as snow coats his face and hair

BEN
What

NATE
There’s a raft out there

Nate points into the distance as A SERIES OF WAVES HITS

The men collectively reactpanic in their eyes as the mood
switches on a dime

BEN
I need every set of eyes on the
water

Ben turns and runs back inside the wheelhouse as the crew
switches gears

CUT TO

EXT BERING SEA - MOMENTS LATER

The Maggie May carefully moves across the violent water
SPOTLIGHTS SHINE from the bow manned by Griggs and
Natethey rake the churning water with the light - briefly

illuminating the snow spray as they home in on

Brady stands beside Ben as he maneuvers the ship towards the
raftdelicately He doesn’t want to run it over

BRADY
No word on any ships going down

Pete helps Cliff as he frantically finishes zipping himself
into a RED SURVIVAL SUITa ‘dry’ suit designed specifically
for survival in cold waterit covers every part of the body
- including face
Sol assists Montoya with the gloves on his suit
BOTH MEN HAVE SAFETY LINES AROUND THEIR WAISTS
BEN (0S)
Raft’s comin’ up starboard Any
sign of life

ON THE BOW - Nate and Griggs shake their heads ‘no’

As Cliff and Montoya rush to the starboard railthey watch
the approaching raft as MORE WAVES CRASH AGAINST THE SHIP

BEN (0S) (CONTD)
Watch it

Sol hands Cliff A LENGTH OF ROPE as Cliff turns to Montoya
CLIFF
I’1l go in first and tie the raft
off

Montoya nods as Cliff takes a few deep breaths preparing
himself for the freezing turbulent water

IN THE WATER - A MOMENT LATER

The sagging raft bucks up against the side of the shipit’s
roof draped loosely over the interior compartment -

Cliff SPLASHES into the water next to the raftties it off
with Sol’s line

Cliff gives the THUMBS UP TO SOL
But then is nearly swamped by the SINKING RAFT as a WAVE
shoves it against the Maggie May pinning him between the

raft and the metal hull of the ship

THE ROAR OF THE WEATHER drowns everything out

ON THE SHIP’S DECK

Sol tosses the line now tied to the raft to Nate who
frantically runs it through the CRAB POT HAULER and HITS THE
HYDRAULICSspooling the line reeling the raft in

IN THE WATER

The raft is TUGGED CLOSE TO THE SHIP by the now taut line
Even in his drysuit Cliff nearly hyperventilates as he
struggles to get a look under the canopy of the raft

INT RAFT - CONTINUOUS

Cliff gets half his body inside the canopythe interior is
dark - only FLASHES OF ORANGE LIGHT from the Maggie May
illuminate the scene inside -

He sees TWO MEN IN SURVIVAL SUITSboth faces opaque white

They’re laying in a growing pool of icy water

CLIFF
Can you hear me

No response Cliff shakes themONE MAN SPUTTERS WEAKLY

Cliffs adrenaline spikes when he sees the vital signs

EXT SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

Montoya watches as Cliff emerges from the raft calls up -

CLIFF

lifeline

Montoya throws A LINE down to Cliff -

INT RAFT - A MOMENT LATER

Cliff TIES THE LINE UNDER THE BREATHING MAN’S ARMPITSties
it offtries to yank him out of the raft but the floor is
sinking even more rapidly from their combined weight Like
quicksand

Cliff pulls harderbut realizes MORE ROPE is tangled around
the unconscious men attached to their suitsand leading to

SMALL METAL LOCKBOXESa dozen of themthe combined weight
pulling the floor even further into the frigid water

CLIFF
Aww shit

Every second he wastes is one closer to being sucked under
water with the overladen raft
INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

begins to sinkwith Cliff and Montoya stuck inside

Pete and Sol grab Cliff and Montoya’s safety linestrying
to pull them out

THE SHIP BUCKS AGAINST A THIRTY FOOT WAVEonce again
slamming the raft against the metal hull and COVERING THE
DECK IN WHITE WATER

Every man is knocked off their feet

ON PETE as he’s washed over the side of the ship in nothing
but his weather gear He desperately tries to grab the rail
but no dice

A LOOK OF HORROR ON HIS FACE as he disappears into the sea

IN THE WHEELHOUSE

Ben anxiously watches the water recedeas the men slowly
recover from the dousingEVERYONE EXCEPT FOR PETE WHO’S
DISAPPEARED

BEN
Oh no

Ben gets on the PA immediately begins turning the ship

BEN

Get on the spotlight

Brady runs to the exterior catwalk and flips on a powerful
halogen light begins panning it across the surging water

EXT SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

Sol immediately throws flotation devices overboard as he
dashes back to the railing looking for Pete in the water

Griggs follows Sol’s lead as Nate looks to the -
CRANE ARM - HANGING ABOVE THE SCENE

Ben’s handling the new problem Nate needs to solve the first
one

Nate moves fastTIES ANOTHER LENGTH OF ROPE to the line
already holding the raft to the side of the Maggie May

HE LOOPS IT OVER A HOOK DANGLING FROM THE CRANE ARM

And moves to the crane controls -
IN THE WATER

The raft is swamped with more waves as it BEGINS TO SLOWLY
RISE OUT OF THE SEA with Cliff and Montoya trapped inside

The heavy fabric BENDING and BOWING from the weight within
IN THE DECKHOUSE

Ben watches worriedas the crane GRINDS struggling under
the load of men waterand who knows what else

Ben slows the engines as he turns the ship around

He glances up at a digital clockat the precious seconds
elapsed since Pete went overboard

Worry is etched across his face as everything slips towards
chaos

ON DECK

Nate drops the sagging raft to the pitching deck with a
CRASH

Montoya and Cliff pull themselves out of the raft
Cliff sees Griggs and Sol staring into the water -

CLIFF

For fuck’s sake

Cliff and Montoya run back to the rail followed by Sol
frantically searching the starboard side waves

BEHIND THEM
Nate runs to the tangled raft sees the two men inside
He looks for help sees Griggs -

NATE

Griggs nods as Nate joins the other men looking for Pete

The greenhorn probes at the deflated raft - can’t make his
way through the raft’s tangled entrance

Brady suddenly appears pulls him away from the entrance
Brady pulls his knife uses it to slice part of the roof away

Griggs hurriedly drags the UNCONSCIOUS MAN from the life raft
to the vinyl booth

Where Brady is already pulling the mask off his RAFT MATE
The man’s eyes are clouded by death

BRADY
This one’s gone

However the Unconscious Man is still breathingbarely
Brady nods -

BRADY (CONTD)

Griggs hesitates for a moment as

Brady opens a storage bin pulls a stack of blankets towels
and a medical kit

Griggs begins unzipping the man’s dry suit -

The weather HOWLS as Sol Montoya and Cliff stand at the
rail straining to find Pete through SNOWFALL and WHITECAPS

The barely conscious Russian begins SHIVERING INTENSELY

Ben immediately focusses on the bundled stranger

BEN

BRADY
Nada

GRIGGS

Russian prison ink

He points out specific ‘candlesticks’ on the Russian’s
stomach

GRIGGS (CONT’D)
These candlesticks don’t mean he
was a candlestick maker
(beat)
Means he’1ll snuff anyone out for a
price

They look at Griggs in surprise

BEN
How the fuck do you know

GRIGGS
Because I shared cells with guys
like these Bad dudes

Ben and Brady share a look

BRADY
We need to get these guys off our

At the rail Cliff continues to scan the turbulent
waterbut there’s close to zero visibility as the snow
comes down even harder

Montoya shrugs helplessly

NATE
We can’t see shit in this weather

CLIFF
Hope to fuck you wouldn’t give up
this quickly if it was me who went
over

NATE
Of course not

Cliffs not even listening
CLIFF
We need a fucking chopper We need
to call the fucking Coast Guard

Holy shit
INT GALLEY - SAME

A DRIPPING sound gets Ben Griggs’ and Brady’s attention

It’s coming from the DEAD RUSSIAN laying on the other side of
the vinyl u-shaped booth A DARK PUDDLE forms under his body

A SWELL ROLLS THE SHIPKNOCKING THE DEAD MAN’S HEAD FROM
THE CUSHIONS

Angling the body downwardhead under the table

ALLOWING A TORRENT OF BLOOD TO EMPTY FROM THE SUIT
SPLASHING TO THE FLOOR OF THE GALLEY

The men stare in disbelief as Brady moves to the dead man to
unzip the dry suit

BEN
Don’t -

Brady ignores himOPENS THE SUIT - just enough to expose -
Just as many tattoos as the man’s living counterpart
AND A BULLET WOUND IN THE DEAD MAN’S CHEST

GRIGGS
Oh man

Everyone continues to stare rooted in place as Nate enters -
oblivious

NATE
Ben you gotta see this -

BEN
Not now

NATE
No Seriously

Nate shoves something in Ben’s handsBen finally looks down
at it

And stops cold - staring at this objecteyes suddenly wide

BEHIND THEM

Unseen by everyone the Russian’s eyes briefly openmore
alert than we’ve seensizing up the situation

INT WHEELHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The small room is crammed with everyone

They all SWAY and compensate for the WEATHER VIOLENTLY
ROLLING THE SHIPspray lashes the windows

No one seems to mind thoughthoughts of mortality have gone
out the window - as they all stare down at

ALL OF THE OLIVE-DRAB RUSTED LOCK BOXES
They’re all open

- HALF THE BOXES FILLED WITH GOLD BARS

- THE OTHER HALF FILLED WITH DIAMONDS

A PISTOL rests atop one pile of diamonds

They’re mesmerized as it all GLITTERS under the cabin lights
Cliff observesbut remains downbeat about it all

Brady picks up the gun toys with it as he eyes the prize

BRADY

How much you think it’s worth
MONTOYA

A lot
BRADY

Were gonna split this shit right

MONTOYA
Of course man

Montoya looks to Ben their leader he’s nervous - still
focussing on piloting the ship through the weather getting
out of Russian waters

MONTOYA (CONTD)
We get more though right Cuz
we’re at full share -

GRIGGS
Bullshit you do

MONTOYA
Shut the fuck up You automatically

Ben’s focus is far from the money

BRADY

BEN
Go down and tie him up

BRADY
He’s half-dead man -

BEN
I don’t give a shit Who knows who

Brady hesitates preferring to stare at the loot
Brady sulks as he sets the found pistol down

Brady relents heads down as Montoya grabs a bar of
goldeyes a STAMP on the surface

CLOSE ON THE STAMP - Japanese characters

That’s an Imperial stamp

Everyone looks to Sol

SOL (CONTD)

MONTOYA
Still doesn’t answer my question
Where did the Russians get it -

SOL
Only two kinds of people in this
part of the world Crabbers and
scavengers
(beat)
Someone probly dug it up from some
sunken ship Maybe these Russians

took it from some treasure hunters

My Daddy told me that when Japs
controlled Attu they used to make
Arctic runs from Germany -

GRIGGS
Who gives a shit It’s ours

Griggs goes to dip his hands in a box of diamonds - and is

stopped short by Cliff
Griggs rips his hand from Cliffs

GRIGGS (CONT’D)
Don’t touch me

CLIFF

Then don’t touch shit that doesn’t

belong to you
Nate turns to Ben

NATE

We got two dead men -

CLIFF

Montoya shakes his head Cliff stares him down

NATE
One missing
(beat)
One deadand another near dead
and a load of stolen loot I’m done
doing prison time

Ben’s frantically running his hand through his hair as he
chains another smokeon the verge of panic as he
contemplates it all

NATE (CONT’D)
Ben

BEN
We can’t call any friendly help til
we get a hundred and fifty miles
east of here

He SHOVES THE THROTTLE TOGGLE all the way forward
The ship VIBRATES as the ENGINES ROAR

BEN (CONTD)
That’s five hours

CLIFF
And Pete’s body We need to at
least try and recover his body -

BEN
We report it all in five hours

Cliff reacts but Ben shuts him down

BEN (CONTD)
Cliff I loved Pete like family
and I know it’s hard to hear but
he’s dead and gone He had thirty
seconds out there no way even the
Coast Guard is going to get him
And we can’t even get them involved
out here

Cliff drops his head

CLIFF
It ain’t right

MONTOYA
What’s right is giving his family a
share of that loot

GRIGGS
You’re serious

Everyone stares at Griggsthis is non-negotiable
NATE
And the man who’s still alive
downstairs What about him
MONTOYA
If he dies he diesit’s all

ours No one else needs to know

Nate’s taken aback by the cold response He looks to the rest
of the menonly Sol looks him in the eyes

Ben listens as he stares out the window at the raging
weather

Nate looks to him but Ben reserves judgement

NATE
You’d let someone die over this

MONTOYA
Fuck him Finders keepers All I
know is that I’m not the only guy
out here who’s broke

Everyone nods except Nate Soland Ben

INT GALLEY - SAME
The Russian’s ankles are now bound with a length of rope

Brady finishes cutting another LENGTH OF ROPE his back to
the Russian

The Russian’s eyes cautiously open He takes note of the rope
and knife

He closes his eyes as Brady turns to face him

INT WHEELHOUSE - SAME

Nate turns to Ben

NATE
You can’t be agreeing with this
shit Say something

BEN
Maybe they’ve got a point

Nate’s shocked

NATE
This ain’t the way to get the ship
out of the hole

BEN
While you’ve been away for the past
five years we’ve been hauling this
rusty tub of shit Supporting half
the family
(beat)
This could be the lucky break we’ve

been waiting on
Cliff acknowledges it with a silent nod

CLIFF
Pete’s share could take care of his
kid for life

NATE
Then what’s the plan if the Russian
wakes up and wants to know where
the fuck his loot went

GRIGGS
Then we kill him

Everyone stares at Griggs for a long beat dumbstruck by his
blunt assessment
CLIFF
I thought I didn’t like you before

But now I’m sure You’re one
disturbed little fucker

GRIGGS
I’m done taking your shit -

Griggs steps up to Cliffa much bigger guy

CLIFF
No psycho You’re not

Ben breaks it up

BEN
Jesus All of you calm down We’re
not gonna murder anyone

MONTOYA
Then what do we do

Ben hesitates He doesn’t really know the answer
CLIFF
Maybe we just put them back in
their raft

Ben reluctantly nods as Nate shakes his head in disgust

INT GALLEY - SAME

Brady has moved onto the booth behind the Russian who is
still stretched out along the bench

He begins wrapping the Russian’s wristscoiling the rope
first around the left and then the right

His head hangs over the Russians reversed
The Russian’s eyes open once more -
STARING STRAIGHT INTO BRADY’S EYES

His bound hands shoot straight up wrapping the rope around
Brady’s neck before the smaller American can react

Brady has unwittingly helped the Russian create a garrotte

-Brady tries to scream but the Russian PULLS HIS WRISTS
APART with all his diminished strength

The rope SCISSORS ACROSS BRADY’S NECK as his face turns
purplehe claws helplessly at the rough line as the Russian
pull him within inches of his own face
Brady kicks helplessly searches for leverage but finds none
He reaches for his KNIFE resting on the tablehe finally
gets a finger on itBUT KNOCKS IT TO THE FLOOR
INT WHEELHOUSE - SAME

NATE

How’s putting them in a raft any
different than murder
Ben doesn’t have a response Nate has a point

soL
I don’t care who he is We need to
get him medical attention It’s the
rule of the sea Situation was
reversed we’d want the same

BEN
I hear you both

Ben taps a lockbox with his foot

BEN (CONTD)
But this is mighty tempting
There’s millions of exceptions to
the rule of the sea right there

Sol’s not swayed

BEN (CONTD)
What I’m saying is how much longer
you going to be able to work the
grounds All of us What do we got
to retire on

soL
Nothing wrong with working for a
living At least I know it’s
honest

Montoya looks between Sol and Nate

Who knows what bad juju this shit’s
got on it

MONTOYA
This is definitely not bad juju
Sol This is a sign Our luck’s
finally fucking turned

NATE
I know you guys are hard but

MONTOYA

Nate looks to each manno one on his side except for Sol
A long beat of silence before Montoya breaks the tension

MONTOYA
then let’s get on with it

NATE
Putting a bullet in his head or
putting him back on the raft is the
same thing Murder You ready for
that

Ben Cliff and Montoya look unsure
NATE (CONTD)
That’s what I thought You have no
idea what it’s like to kill

someone

GRIGGS
I do

Everyone turns their attention back to him For the first
time Cliff looks a little unsure of the pecking order

GRIGGS (CONT’D)
What about you

Nate doesn’t answer
Griggs is unflinching
GRIGGS (CONTD)
Youre forgetting that the guy’s a
killer

Griggs looks to everyone else
GRIGGS (CONTD)
It’ll be justice for everyone he’s
ever killed And then we’1ll get our
reward for it

CLIFF
That’s right Russian’s a murderer
Makes me feel better about dumping
‘em back in the raft already

soL
We’re not judge and jury

GRIGGS
Why the hell not It’s the open
sea It’s the fucking wild west out

Everyone looks expectantly at Ben What’s his decision

BEN
No

Not yet
NATE
Not yet What the fuck are you

talking about -

BEN

We don’t need to do anything about
it yet If he’s still alive in five
hours then we’ll cross that
bridge

(beat)
Until then we’ve got time to think
it over

Nate bites his tongue as Ben pushes the throttle further
forward nearly red-lining the engines

NATE
Ben -

BEN
No more discussion

He looks at Montoya Cliff and Griggs

BEN (CONT’D)
Get Brady up here

Montoya nods with a smile bounds down the stairway into

INT GALLEY - CONTINUOUS
Montoya looks across the empty galley confused

MONTOYA
Brady

Montoya sees two feet sticking out of the galley booth
He approaches the booth cautiously sees Brady’s lifeless
body slumped in the booth - his dead eyes open and empty his

neck swollen with purple abrasions from the rope

Montoya sees the ropes and blankets discarded by the Russian
looks around wildly but still no sign of the intruder

He quickly backs away from Brady’s corpse stumbling over the
dead body of other Russian

MONTOYA (CONTD)

Goddammit

Ben grabs the Russian’s gun still resting on the crates

He chambers a round puts it in his waistband as he looks to
Nate

BEN
Looks like this guy made the
decision for us

Ben turns to a console opens a wide narrow drawer that
contains a messy stack of unfurled maps and charts

He pulls out a blueprint of the ship spreads it out on top
of the console

CLOSE ON the ship’s blueprint as Ben points to the aft
sections of the ship where the wheelhouse and living
quarters are laid out

He points to it for Griggs’ benefit

BEN (CONTD)
This is where we are right now
Got it

Griggs nods as Ben points out each location

BEN (CONTD)

Solly you check the engine room
Cliff take the aft weather deck
Nate Griggs and Montoya start here
with the bunks and head -

Griggs grows impatient
GRIGGS
C’mon man it’s a goddam ship This

guy can’t have gone that far

CLIFF
Shut up and listen

BEN
This ship was a World War II Oiler
Lots of unused space below to hide

in

CLIFF
You get lost we may never fucking
find you

Ben looks at his crew as he points to the mapeveryone
starting their search at the back of the ship

BEN

him forward and corner him at the
front of the ship

Though the engines continue to dronethe darkness outside

Both Ben and Nate are suddenly captivated by a strange
PULSING RED GLOW coming from one of the boxes of diamonds

Nate digs into the diamonds
AND RETRIEVES A SMALL GPS DEVICE
The brothers pause to stare at it -

NATE

Ben barely reacts

NATE (CONTD)
He’s slowing us down so his friends

We hear a WET THUD
THE BLUE EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON

ILLUMINATES GRIGGSblocking his eyes from the bright light
with a blood covered hand as he slips and slides

The ship rolls as he attempts to stand -

INT ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The ENGINE DRONE is deafening echoing through the cavernous
space bordered by pipes tubes and hosesa strange
mechanical mazemade all the worse by the rolling seas
breaking against the hull

All is illuminated by the narrow beam of a high-powered
flashlight wielded by Sol

He cautiously moves forwardknife in one hand flashlight
in the other as he attempts to ignore the STRANGE SHADOWS and
the cubby holes where the Russian could be hiding

Sol finds himself at the end of one of the TWO LONG 16
CYLINDER ENGINE BLOCKS

The engine VIBRATES as it strainsSTEAM AND SMOKE wafting
from the cylinderssomething’s not right

UP AHEAD

His FLASHLIGHT illuminates the other end of the blocknear
a BUNDLE OF SEVERED COOLANT HOSES

LIQUID SPRAYS in silhouette against the light

Sol’s breath catches as he pauses - he draws the knife
higher switching his grip he looks more like a knife-fighter
nowolder grizzled - but still formidable

He moves slower edges closer to the other end of the engine

INT ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sol reaches for the engine shutdown lever -

AS AN AXE BLADE FLIES INTO FRAME - REMOVING FOUR OF SOL’S
FINGERS AT THE FIRST KNUCKLE

Sol stares at his hand in shock as the Russian swings the axe
againat his head

Sol dodges instinctively - cradling his stump as he
desperately lashes out with his own knife

Sol’s blade catches the Russian off-guard SLASHING A GOUGE
across the man’s forearm

The Russian reflexively drops the axe and is defenseless for
the moment

But Sol slips on the oil-slicked steel floorloses his
leverage

The Russian spins to the side deceptively agile and strong -
dodges Sol’s blade as the older man slashes at the air -

The Russian uses a combination of sticky hands and down and
dirty prison-yard brawling

He pivots Sol’s momentum almost like a bullfighter
launching the older man forward in the cramped space

Sol goes head-first with a CRUNCH against the OVERHEATING
ENGINE

Sol slowly pulls himself up braces himself on the engine
with his good hand

CLOSE ON HIS HAND as it SIZZLES AGAINST THE METAL
The Russian finds new strength

He dodges a few swipes of Sol’s knife then blocks a jab
returns a blow to Sol’s temple with the STEEL FLASHLIGHT

Sol drops his knifeas the Russian follows through with the
heel of his palm to Sol’s nose - BREAKING IT WITH A CRUNCH

Sol is knocked back onto the smoking vibrating engine block
Blood STREAMS from Sol’s facehe’s dazed
The Russian picks his ice axe from the dirty floor

He holds Sol at bay as he hisses under the noise his face
filled with rage -

RUSSIAN
(subtitled)
Golddiamonds Where the fuck is
it

Sol doesn’t understand incomprehension in his eyes
The Russian growls in frustration

soL
Fuck you

This the Russian understands

The Russian SWINGS THE FILTHY AXE into Sol’s bellyRIPS
UPWARDeye to eye with Sol

He stares into Sol’s eyes as the older man GASPS in shock

The Russian looms over him slowly withdraws the serrated
blade - ready to finish the American off when

FLASHLIGHTS AND SHOUTS from the stairway behind them

NATE (0S)
Sol

The Russian quickly backs into the shadows further into a

NARROW MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR running below the waterline the
length of the hull towards the bow

AT THE STAIRS

Ben Cliff and Montoya bound into the compartment
FLASHLIGHTS cutting through the SMOKE AND STEAM

Ben shouts over the engine noise

BEN
Solly you down there

As the three move into the compartment Cliff shines his
light on the ELECTRICAL PANEL on the nearby bulkhead

The panel’s door is open the inside WIRING SLASHED AND
SHREDDED

NATE
Shit Panel’s cooked

Ben finally pulls the SHUTDOWN LEVERshutting the damaged
motor downthe second motor struggles to pull the ship
through the storm

FURTHER IN THE ENGINE ROOM Montoya’s light finds Sol
slumped against the engine block clutching his lacerated
stomach

MONTOYA
Oh man

Montoya Ben and Cliff converge on Solthey see the blood
pouring from his facehis severed fingers

Sol looks down to his hands covering his belly seeping red -

He grits his teeth in pain moves his hands enough for Ben
and the others to see the deep wound

CLIFF
Ah Jesus

BEN
Where is he

Sol nods toward the MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR

soL
I think the fucker really wants his
gold

Sol passes out as Ben pulls the Russian’s pistol from his
waistband checks the clip as

He peers down the darkened MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR that
disappears into the bowels of the shipmore like an
insulated cave to nowhere

Cliff starts to panic

CLIFF
Were so fucked Game over man

BEN
Just shut up and focus
(beat)
He gets far enough forward he
could open the saltwater pumps
flood the ship who knows what
else

NATE
Or he could end up on deck and
double back to the wheelhouse In
which case it really is game over -

Ben turns to Montoya

BEN
Well try and trap him in between
(beat)
(MORE)

BEN (CONTD)

You take the top deck I’1ll take
the low Make sure he doesn’t move
forward and get back up top through
the hatch under the weather deck in
the bow Last thing I want is that
fucker doing something with the
pots

(beat)
He destabilizes the stack it’1ll
sink us faster than the ice

Montoya hesitates as he stares at Sol’s horrific injuries

BEN (CONTD)
What are you waiting on

Montoya looks between Nate Ben and Solunsure

BEN (CONT’D)

Youve got a gun I’ve got a gun
Ivan’s got an axe If you won’t man
up I bet the greenhorn would be
more than eager

Montoya finally snaps out of it

MONTOYA
Fuck that

He moves back up the stairs

NATE
Make sure you’ve got a clear shot
do not aim near the hull or pipes
We don’t need to help the Bering
kill us -

Montoya waves him off annoyed

Ben surveys the engine damage as Cliff checks Sol’s
vitalsslipping into panic

CLIFF
Shit man he needs a doctor -

Ben ignores him looks towards the shredded electrical box
BEN
Nate get that box rewired then
get some spare hose We get this

Cliff gets in Ben’s face officially panicking

CLIFF
What about Sol We can’t just
leave him down here

BEN
What the hell do you want from me
He’s fucked up Right now I’m
trying to make sure the rest of us

rotten crab stinkin’ up the tank

Ben grabs Cliff by the throat shoves him against the
bulkheadthe wheels have officially come off

BEN
I care as much about Sol as you do
But if we don’t get this shit
working in the next few minutes
we’re all gonna be under a sheet of

Cliff is cold and stubborn he looks to Nate

CLIFF

BEN

Cliff won’t budge
Ben finally looks to Sol
BEN (CONTD)
Take Sol to the galley Then get
down here to help Nate fix this

allow for access to the

holds anchor gear and lineand the hatch that is the only
exit from the Maintenance Corridor running the length of the

He raises the shotgun and flashlightbegins to move
cautiously across the deck towards the stack and the weather
deck behind it in the bow

Ben’s flashlight barely cuts through the inky darkness as he
slowly moves forward within the bowels of the ship

Insulated crab tanks make up the walls to both sides

The SOUND OF SLOSHING WATER permeates the claustrophobic
space as the ship ROLLSknocking him back and forth against
the walls

He mops sweat from his brow keeps the Russian’s pistol
pointed forward

The flashlight reveals nothing but more labyrinthine pipes
ahead

A DARK SHADOW suddenly darts between pipes at the end of the
corridor

The SHIP ROCKS from the storm -

Causing Ben to drop the flashlight in his rush to raise the
pistol -

Finger on trigger - he stops himselflooking to the pipes
around his headALL FULL WITH SLOSHING SEAWATER FOR THE

Russian had been only thirty minutes before

The ship GROANS as waves crash against itrocking it like a
cork in the ocean as the single remaining engine STRUGGLES
AND VIBRATES below deck

BLOOD soaks Sol’s shredded shirtDRIP DRIP DRIPPING to
the floor from the vinyl and mingling with the

PUDDLE OF BLOOD from the dead Russian still laying there in
the adjoining seat lifeless and cold

The Sol’s breathing is raggedit catches as he looks to
Brady’s dead body on the floor

Cliff grabs a towel from the kitchen presses it into Sol’s
hands still covering the axe wound

CLIFF
Keep it pressed tight we’ll get
you some help soon

Sol’s unconvinced

soL
Yeah right

INT ENGINE ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

The room is pitch black Nate uses his flashlight to
illuminate the electrical box He struggles to make sense of
the shredded wiresespecially through the acrid oil smoke

Cliff emerges from the stairs

CLIFF
You were rightabout all of it

Cliff shakes his head in shame

CLIFF (CONTD)
Id rather live and take the blame
with the rest of these assholes
than die out here

NATE
Too little too late Cliff
CLIFF

CLIFF

He nervously rapidly looks between a half-full pack on the

miss something in the darkness

ON THE DECK BELOWMontoya moves forward with his flashlight
against the snow and sleet

BEHIND GRIGGS
Cliff appears at the top of the stairs

Griggs jumps grabs his knife as Cliff approaches him

Cliff heads to the DOOR BEHIND GRIGGS TOWARDS THE EXTERIOR

CLIFF
Keep your eyes on the ice

Griggs stares Cliff down rage welling in his eyes
Cliff takes a menacing step towards him

Griggs keeps his mouth shut but doesn’t look happy about it

CLIFF (CONTD)
Eyes front fuck-face

Griggs’ looks to the stacked gold for motivation to focus on
the task at hand

His face darkens as he returns his gaze to the black surging
seas ahead

BEHIND HIM Cliff exits the wheelhouse starts to climb the
icy outside ladder to the roof

CUT TO

INT MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - SAME

Ben cautiously continues down the claustrophobic tunnel below
the waterline His flashlight and pistol are aimed forward in
the darkness

Having passed crab tanks he enters a new -

WATER TIGHT COMPARTMENT

Ahead on his right sits a tight bundle of refrigeration
compressors and pipes - all powerless and eerily
silentcasting strange shadows on the walls

Ahead on his left an open entry to a cavernous -

DRY HOLD

Ben presses his back to the bulkhead next to the open
entryway grips his light and gun readying for what lies
around the corner

With a quick motion he swings his light and gun around
frantically scanning the interior of the dry hold like a bad
TV cop

But no Russian - only ancient boxes on the shelves

Ben exhales nervous relieved for a moment

Until he shines his light into the far corner between the
shelves where his light disappears into blackness of a hole
that leads to some sealed up long-forgotten compartment
Ben cautiously crosses the dry hold to the corner where a gap
in the steel bulkheads has left an open irregular-shaped
crawlspace

Ben squats down and shines his light through the crawlspace

entrance but can’t see very far into the dark void
beyondthe guts of the ship

He gets on his stomach inches his way into the

CRAWLSPACE

A narrow pitch black duct running through the ribs of the
big ship meant for hull repairs

He’s extremely vulnerable - literally inches from the water
on the other side of the curving thin metal hull beside his
head

Ben does his best to keep his flashlight and gun pointed in
front of him while in this vulnerable position

REVERSE POV from inside the darkness Ben’s head illuminated
by his flashlight slides into view hovering eerily in a sea
of blackness

Ben’s heart races his breath quickens as the ship’s
superstructure CREAKS and MOANS against the storm surge

With every reverberating STEEL POP Ben frantically swings
his flashlight around from his prone position looking
desperately for the Russian

FOOTSTEPS pound on the metal floorseemingly all around
himbut he can’t trace the movement

Ben finally slides out of the far end of the space returns
to the service tunnel and continues forward

Ahead of him the end of the maintenance corridor is now
visiblea small angular room - the collision bulkhead and
a wider open space around a metal ladder to the upper deck

Ben inches forward -

Montoya cautiously makes his way through the weather and
across the open fishing deck as the ship continues its rough
undulations

RUSSIAN’S POV - FROM THE RECESSES OF THE CRAB-POT MAZE - we
watch Montoya make his way forwardhesitant to move within
the CREAKING pots

Montoya steps carefully across the deck’s icy surface trying
to keep both his flashlight and shotgun aimed ahead

Montoya pauses mid-deck pans his light across the looming
stack of steel pots in front of him searching for signs of
the Russian seeing nothing

SUDDENLY A METALLIC CLANG behind Montoya

Montoya whips around ready to fire

MORE BANGING and Montoya sees that it’s only the CRANE’S
BLOCK AND TACKLE - BANGING into the bulwark

Montoya shakes it off continues forward toward the stack
carefully skirting the OPEN HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE DECK
sloshing opening of the water-filled crab tank

As Montoya eyes the tank hole A SHADOW flashes through the
maze of pots ahead of him

CUT TO

Nate gives up on the electrical panel and moves further into
the engine room filled with thick acrid smoke

For the first time Nate sees the extent of the engine damage

wades into the problem

Cliff battles the wind and ice as he mounts the top of the
ladder leading to the roof of the wheelhouse

As he reaches the roof he slips on the icy surface falling
to his knees

HE SLIDES ON THE ICE towards the edge -

Griggs reacts to the THUMP on the roof above his head

EXT WHEELHOUSE ROOF - SAME

Cliff gropes for the safety cable strung across the rooftop
perimeter - the only thing between him and the icy water

Cliff pulls himself to his feet looks at the blanket of
darkness around him

HEAVY WIND AND SNOW whips his face and rain gear
We can barely make out the ghostly white shapes of ice
floating alongside the Maggie May as she rides the steep

troughs and swells

The freezing spray stings Cliff’s face as he gets his
balance looks across the rooftop sees what he came for

ON THE ROOF’S LOWER STEP next to two large plastic barrels
containing the inflatable life-rafts

THE EPIRB

Cliff grips the cable rides the roof as if it were a bronco
as he starts making his way toward the EPIRB

BEHIND CLIFF - a head appears at the top of the ladder

It’s Griggs

GRIGGS
What are you doing
CLIFF
Same to you Who’s watching the

helm
Griggs staggers toward Cliff keeps his eyes on him

GRIGGS
You aren’t touching the EPIRB

CLIFF
Get back downstairs

Griggs continues toward Cliff when suddenly -

THE ENTIRE WHEELHOUSE BUCKS SIDEWAYS

Cliff is thrown away from the railing lands hard on Griggs
as the ship SHUDDERS AND GROANS

EXT MAGGIE MAY - SAME

The starboard-side bow of the ship rakes across an ICE BERG
THE SIZE OF A TRUCK

EXT UNDERWATER - SAME

below water the ice is ten times as big It’s ragged
underside RIPS into the Maggie May’s thin hull

EXT MAGGIE MAY - CONTINUOUS

The collision doesn’t budge the berg instead the Maggie May
is lifted roughly out of the water and shunted to the side
like a toy

Everyone and everything on board is rocked violently

Montoya is knocked off his feet tumbles across the icy deck
and slides into the gaping opening of the crab tank

His flashlight and shotgun skitter across the deck as he
plunges into the frigid waters of the saltwater tank

INT CRAB TANK -— CONTINUOUS

Montoya struggles under the dark cold saltwater of the tank

His feet kick around the GRASPING CRAB piled around the
bottom of the tank

He kicks them offbubbles stream from his mouth as he
SCREAMS under water

- THE MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR

Ben is knocked out of the corridor into the dark open space
around the ladder leading up to the main deck

Caught off-guard he scrambles to aim his light and gun into
the new surroundings wary of the lurking Russian

- THE ENGINE ROOM

Nate is jolted sideways crashes hard into the overheated
engine as spare parts come crashing off the shelves

INT CRAB TANK - SAME

Montoya struggles in the freezing water

He swims upward towards the NARROW CIRCLE OF LIGHT above his
head like a hole in an icy pond

The water SLOSHES and SWAYS with the motion of the ship
frustrating his efforts

With a huge effort he finally gains a hold on the edge of
the holepulls himself up -

EXT MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

Montoya quickly surfaces gasping for breath shocked by the
temperature hands grasping for purchase on the icy deck
EXT WHEELHOUSE ROOF - SAME

Cliff disentangles himself from Griggs looks frantically
toward the bow of the ship and sees the over-sized chunk of

ice slide by in the water

Griggs gets on his feet but Cliff is on him venting his
rage

He pummels Griggs whaling on him relentlessly
CLIFF
Stupid motherfucker
EXT MAIN DECK - SAME

Montoya still struggles futilely to pull himself out of the
freezing water of the crab tank and onto to the deck

BEHIND HIM the Russian emerges from his hiding place within
the stack of pots axe in hand

The Russian sees Montoya’s vulnerable situation pauses at
the base of the stack

He abruptly lifts the axe and swings

The axe connects with one of the icy chains tethering the
stack of pots in place

The chain SNAPS and the entire port-side stack of pots
lurches CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION
OTHER BRITTLE CHAINS BREAK FREE

But the stack holdsbarely Montoya panics at the sight of
the leaning tower of pots - looming ominously over his head

MONTOYA
(sotto)
Oh shit oh shit oh shit
He struggles to pull himself out of the saltwater tank

The Russian stoically eyes the stackthis wasn’t the
intended effect

CLOSE ON THE RUSTED CLEAT BARELY WELDED TO THE DECK

A single chain is wrapped around the GROANING cleatIT
HOLDS THE ENTIRE STACK IN PLACE

With a loud PING the chain finally SNAPS - whipping across
the deck and releasing the energy stored in the two story
stack of metal

Pots tumble down like a house of cards

A VAST MAJORITY slide across the icy deck like an avalanche

Montoya only halfway out of the hole has no time to react as
the steel cages come racing toward him at high speed

Montoya lets out a scream that’s immediately silenced as a
few tons of steel crash into his exposed upper body

Still half submerged in the hole Montoya’s body is ripped
in half

His upper torso is dragged across the full length of the deck
by the careening pots leaving a red streak of blood and gore
across the white ice

INSIDE THE CRAB TANK - a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals Montoya’s
severed lower halfit bloodies the water as it slowly
settles to the bottom of the tank among the pale pink Opilio
crabsalready scrambling for bits of his flesh

EXT WHEELHOUSE ROOFTOP - SAME

The commotion below interrupts Cliff beating on Griggs He
turns sees the pots crashing across the deck

CLIFF
Holy shit

Behind him Griggs wheezes for breath coughs out a rope of
bloody saliva

Griggs rights himself then seizes the moment using the
distraction to catch Cliff off-guard

In one fluid motion Griggs grabs Cliff by the belt and
slicker from the back hauls him sideways and with a grunt
shoves him over the cable-railing

CLIFF FLAILS AND SCREAMS AS HE PLUMMETS FIVE STORIES TO THE
DARK ICY WATER BELOW

Griggs catches his breath still recovering from his
punishment and stares wide-eyed at the inky blackness below

For the briefest moment he catches sight of Cliff’s bobbing
body

And then a rolling ice-filled wave carries Cliff off into
oblivion his FRANTIC SHOUTS drowned by the ROAR of the

ocean

Griggs looks stunned for a moment watching Cliff
disappearas if he can’t believe what he just did

Griggs looks to the EPIRBstill secure in its cradle

As the ship GRINDS off the iceREVERBERATING throughout the
hull

He looks over the roof’s edge towards the MAIN DECK and the
collapsed mountain of pots

A STREAK OF BLOOD ACROSS THE ICE

He scrambles to the ladder

feet

He sprints through the water SLOSHING his way forward down

as he searches for the hull rupture

EXT MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

Seemingly impervious to the ice and snow the Russian emerges
from the fallen stack of potshe moves towards the STREAK
OF MONTOYA’S GORE

He tracks the trail towards a mountain of bent and twisted
potswhere Montoya’s mangled corpse rests somewhere inside

The Russian picks up the stray shotgun
BOOM - BOOM
BULLETS RICOCHET AROUND HIM

BEN (0S)
DIE YOU PIECE OF SHIT

The Russian turns to find Ben clambering out of the hatch in
the forward WEATHER DECKover the toppled pots and FIRES
the Russian’s pistol from the hip

The shots are surprisingly close given the rough seas Ben’s
got sea legs from years on the water

The Russian raises the shotgun to fire but he doesn’t have
Ben’s balance BOOM as his shot goes wild -

Ben fearlessly stalks towards the Russian - pushed over the
edge

BOOM

The Russian is hit in the thighhe goes down on the icy
deck grimacing in painBLOOD SPRAYING from the wound

Griggs nearly slips off the ladder as the GUNSHOTS echo

He leaps off the remaining stepscrawls through the door
into the Wheelhouse

EXT MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

Ben slips over the icy pots as A WAVE SLAMS THE SHIP
DOUSING HIM WITH FRIGID WHITE WATER

The Russian grips the shotgun uses his other hand to pull
himself across the deck and into the DECK HOUSE

Ben lets off another wild round - STRIKING THE GLASS OF THE
WHEELHOUSE

Griggs stays low as the GLASS SHATTERSTHE BULLET COMING TO
REST IN THE CAPTAIN’S CHAIR

He crawls under the dash for protection

INT DECKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

SEEPING FROM HIS WOUNDED LEG

The blood leaves a RAGGED SMEAR across the white linoleum as
he drags himself down another set of stairs towards the
galley

Ben slips and slides sprinting over the blood covered ice to
the deckhouse in pursuit of the Russian

INT DRY HOLD - CONTINUOUS

Deep below the waterline Nate struggles through the
waterSHIVERS in the cold

The ENGINE NOISE and RUSHING WATER make him oblivious to the
gunfight above

He shakes his head in frustration at the size of the hole -

The Russian pulls himself into the warmth of the galleyas

BEN APPEARS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

Ben misses by a milebut the wood paneling beside his head
EXPLODES IN SPLINTERS

He falls back with a SCREAM HIS EYES STUNG BY WOOD CHIPS

INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Above the action Griggs can’t squeeze himself any closer to
the wall trying to stay under cover

INT GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The Russian falls back behind cover with a mysterious smile
He starts SOFTLY CHUCKLING to himself

The Russian pulls himself to his feet His shotgun is loosely
trained on the corridor entrance at Ben’s hiding spot as he

looks behind him at the cold dead body of his companion

Then to Sol gasping for breath - HIS EYES LIKE DAGGERS

The Russian smiles as he moves over to SolJABS his seeping
belly wound with the shotgun

Sol GROANS IN PAIN
soL
Should’ve killed you in the

first place

Sol weakly bats the barrel awaythe Russian only smiles
condescending

Ben suddenly appears at the door - pistol aimed at the
Russian’s back

The Russian doesn’t even bother to turn as
Ben wastes no time in PULLING THE TRIGGER

The Russian slowly turns favoring his good leg

Ben pulls the trigger again out of desperation CLICK
The Russian winks indicates the useless gun in Ben’s hand

He jabs the shotgun towards Ben’s forehead

Sol watches the exchangedesperately wishing he could do

Ben just starts to dodge as - BOOOOOOM
ON THE FLOOR - Sol has slashed at the Russian’s exposed

AUDIBLY
WE WATCH AS THE LIGAMENT AND MUSCLE RETRACT UP THE MAN’S LEG
The Russian COLLAPSES to the floor beside -

Ben GROANING through his own paingingerly holding the
bloody hole that was once his right ear

Ben sees the shotgun goes for it -
He and the Russian grapple for the weapon

Each slips and slides over the slick PUDDLE OF BLOODthe
penknife still protruding from the Russian’s ankle

Ben gets the upper hand rolling on top of the Russian

Ben puts all his weight on the shotgun a bar across the
Russian’s throat

The Russian’s eyes bulge filling with blood as he loses the
fight

-THE RUSSIAN FINDS HIMSELF STARING AT BRADY’S DEAD EYES

He turns his head as he struggles to pull the KNIFE from his
own anklebut he’s slowly losing strength

The Russian GASPS and GURGLES as Ben presses harder eyes
wide SCREAMING MANIACALLY in the killer’s face

And then with a SICKENING CRUNCH the Russian STOPS
STRUGGLINGhis hand only inches from the knife still
embedded in his ankle

Ben doesn’t care he keeps strangling the man who seemed
invincible

Ben doesn’t hear him

SOL (CONTD)

Ben suddenly looks up to Sol Realizes the Russian is
finally fucking dead
He rolls off the Russian exhausted struggling to breathe
REVEALING NATEjust entering the galley

Nate looks between Ben Sol and the Russian - clearly shocked
at the aftermath

CUT TO

EXT MAGGIE MAY - PRE-DAWN

The storm is over and the clouds have started to recede
revealing a few dim stars in the sky above The sea is glass

For the first time it’s serene and beautiful out here

On the horizon a hint of clear blue daybreak illuminating
the dark silhouette of

ATTU ISLAND - Alaska’s western-most Aleutian Island
Extending out from and surrounding Attu is a frozen white
expanselike an enormous frozen desert plain dotted with

car-sized berms of ice (known as ‘boxcars’)

This is a part of the ice pack - the dreaded mass of solid
ice covering the Bering Sea in all directions

A few miles away the Maggie May slowly putters through the
ice-covered seas toward Attu and the ice pack

The ship is clearly crippledshe lists heavily on her
starboard side as she heads for a small bay

EXT BAY - FROM ABOVE

The Maggie May is closing in on the edge of the mostly solid
ice blocking access to the rest of the inlet

INT ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Half-way down the steps Nate shines a light into the now-
flooded engine compartment

The murky water level is even higher than before sloshing
perilously close to the single functioning engine block

INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ben is back at the helm the bone-chilling wind whips through
the broken glass as he navigates the ship through the ice

The shotgun rests at Ben’s side his bloodied earhole now
dressed with a makeshift bandage of gauze and duct tape

This had been a very long day for the Captain

He keeps one eye on the sea ahead one eye on

EXT MAIN DECK - SAME
Griggs labors in weather gear

He struggles to maintain his balance on the listing ship’s
slanted deck

REVEAL that he’s shoving Brady’s stiff dead body into one of
the steel crab pots

ANOTHER POT beside him already contains the dead Russians
Both pots are tied off to the high side of the deck

He eyes the starboard rail warilythe low side of the
angled deckwhere WATER LAPS dangerously

BEN (0S)
Make sure to get clear of those
pots when you cut ‘em free

REVEAL BEN shouting from the shattered wheelhouse window
above

Griggs nods doesn’t stop working

INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Nate comes up the stairwell from below watches Griggs for a
few moments doesn’t acknowledge Ben

NATE
You really think Cliff slipped off
the roof

BEN
Not for a minute

Both men seem numb as they stare at Griggs on deck

NATE
The kid’s psychotic

Ben checks that his shotgun is loaded

BEN
We’ll sort it out on land

NATE
We’re not gonna make land

Ben eyes the ice around the shipalready thickeningnot
allowing the ship to make much more forward progress

BEN
Then we walk the rest of the way to
the island

NATE

Dragging a half ton of gold
Ben nods

BEN
The ice should be thick enough
Well bury it and come back after
the thaw

Nate shakes his headnot wanting any part of it

NATE
I’1l1 launch the EPIRB get the
Guard on their way for Sol

BEN
You walk ahead take Sol to Attu
(beat)
But the EPIRB’11 go off when the
ship goes does down We need a head
start -

NATE
That’s too long

Ben’s temper rises

BEN
We lose that loot we lose
everything

Nate moves past Benheaded to the outer catwalk and the
ladder that leads to the roof of the wheelhouse

BEN (CONTD)
Do not touch the EPIRB You owe me
and the family that much

NATE
(incredulous)
What

BEN
Weve been trying to climb out of a
pit since that night you fucked
upall that motherfucking stress
you put on us
(beat)
All your bullshitit killed him

NATE
What the hell are you talking
about

BEN

Youfucking killed Dad

Nate takes a step away from the ladder - moves towards Ben
Menacing

NATE
What did you just say

BEN
You heard me

NATE
I don’t owe you or anyone else
anything And you don’t know shit
about what really happened

BEN
The fuck I don’t

Ben’s unsure as Nate turns his back moves to the ladder

Ben’s hand reflexively moves to the shotgun in a not so
subtle gesture

NATE
Shoot me

Ben can’t bring himself to put the shotgun on his brother
NATE (CONTD)

When this is all over we go our
separate ways

BEN

Nate you just don’t fucking get

it It was never just about us

This money is gonna go a long way

for the guys’ families
Nate pauses in thought his back still turned
But he’s still got Sol to think about He heads up the ladder
to release the EPIRB
EXT WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS
Nate steps up to the sloping slick roof

He moves to the EPIRB at the roof’s edge -

EXT MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

Griggs watches as Nate goes for the EPIRBUNLATCHES IT FROM
ITS CRADLE

Griggs looks up to Bennot doing anything about it
Ben shouts down to Griggs

BEN
Guard’1l be here in a few hours

Griggs gives one last shove nearly slips on his ass but gets
Brady’s body in the trap

He rights himself and grabs an AXE - swings it high

Severs the rope holding the traps and their gruesome cargo to
the angled deck

BOTH TRAPS SLIDE ACROSS THE ICY DECK AND INTO THE BERING

INT WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Ben watches the bodies sink into the blackness

CUT TO

EXT ICE PACK - LATER

The bright sunrise is surrealreflecting off a mile of
broken ice and boxcars surrounding the tiny deserted island

If it wasn’t for the crystal blue skies the scene could be
mistaken for the surface of the moon

A HOWLING wind whips across the icy deck now angled 45
degrees and deep into the waterand slipping further by the
secondthe freezing water now laps across it like an
artificial beach

Ben and Griggs STAND ON THE ICE

They’ve insulated themselves against the elements as much as
possible - layering their DECK WEAR and DOWN COATS over their
DRY SUITS

They tie on makeshift harnessesheavy duty line strapped
across their chests and attached to TWO SEPARATE MAGGIE MAY
LIFE RAFTSEACH FILLED WITH SIX JAPANESE EMBLAZONED
LOCKBOXES

The rafts are held in place and out of the water by multiple
ropes tied to the port side rail angled high in the air

Griggs tests the ropeslooks first to the treasure laden
rafts and then across the white rugged expanse to the
islandseemingly an infinity away

He looks worried as he shifts his steps on the crunching ice

GRIGGS
Why can’t we just drop this loot in
a pot with a buoycome back for
it later

BEN
Because the ice’1ll pop the buoy and
drag this shit halfway back to
Russia

Griggs nods to himselfstill worried as he looks to the
shoreline ahead

Ben points straight aheadNORTH beyond the bay to a
distant treeline past the ice-locked beach

BEN (CONTD)

That’s where we bury it
(off Griggs’ skepticism)

The ice is thicker than it looks
We already split the load so the
weight’1l be less concentrated If
we keep moving we won’t have to
worry

Griggs watches as Ben duct-tapes the shotgun to his forearm

GRIGGS
What’s that for

BEN
Just in case

Griggs isn’t convinced
AT THE DECKHOUSE

Nate suddenly appears from the door now at the top of the
angled deckSOL OVER HIS SHOULDERS in a firemans carry

He ignores Ben and Griggs as

Nate carefully picks his way down to the edge of the
deckSol perched precariously above it all

Nate pauses at the icethe surreality of the situation
seeping in

Ben watches closely as

Nate takes his first step onto the CREAKING SNOW-COVERED
ICE

He begins carefully walking NORTH straight for the shorea
mound of white in the distance

Ben moves to the ice as well followed by Griggs

Ben pulls an axe - Griggs holds his ‘harness ropes’ fearfully
as Ben readies to chop the ropes holding the half-ton life
rafts in place

If the rafts sink so do he and Ben

Ben finally CHOPS

The rafts slide down the icy deckCOME TO REST ON THE ICE
BEHIND THEM

THE ICE CREAKS UNDER THE WEIGHT

EXT ICE PACK - CONTINUOUS
Nate turns at the sound of the rafts hitting the ice

Ben and Griggs start pulling like sled dogsGriggs sticks a
little too close to Ben

BEN
Don’t bunch up we need to spread
the weight out

Nate turns away from them starts trudging towards the island
as Sol WHEEZES faintly his face only inches from Nates

THE ISLAND SEEMS TINYFAR AWAY

EXT BAY - FROM HIGH ABOVE

We watch the two parties move north on the same path from the
crippled ship

Even with Sol on his back Nate rapidly outpaces Ben and
Griggs

BLEND TO

EXT ICE PACKATTU SHORELINE - LATER
The sun is higher in the sky
Parts of the ice sheet melt under the heat of the rising sun

Making Nate’s labored steps even more treacherous as he
finally gets close to the ‘shore’

He heaves and pantswilling his legs to move across the
crackling treacherous landscape

ANGLE ON ATTU ISLAND

The island looms large aheadits frozen treeline and craggy
hills dominating the skyline now

Only a few yards to the ‘beach’and a safe place to wait
for rescue

Nate moves past a large ice ‘boxcar’

He struggles for breath as he places Sol gently on the snow
behind the berm

He shields his eyes from the glare and wind-whipped snow as
he looks over his shoulder back towards the water

ANGLE ON THE WATER IN THE DISTANCE

Ben and Griggs are tiny red figurines dragging their rafts
towards Nate and Sol

Nate looks past them towards THE MAGGIE MAY

The family ship is half-sunkleaning on the melting ice-
floeits deck exposed to the sun

Nate turns back to Sol

NATE
Sol

He eats some snow as he tries to regain some fluidsscoops
some for Sol who’s motionless

NATE (CONTD)
Sol We fucking made it

He leans down to the older man pries open his eyes -
CLOUDED AND UNBLINKINGSOL IS DEAD

Nate struggles to catch his breath as he falls back against
the boxcar Utterly defeated

He cranes his neck around the boxcar to see Griggs and Ben
still far in the distance behind him

NATE (CONT’D)
Motherfuckers
ON BEN AND GRIGGS - CONTINUOUS

The men are exhausted and sunburnedsweating profusely in
the sun

They trudge through a maze of knee-high boxcarsdragging
the heavy rafts over the icelike a white desert

THE ICE CRACKS AND SWAYS AS THEY MOVEbut neither has the
strength to worry anymore

Ben looks to Griggs who’s halted and staring in confusion at
the carcass of the Maggie May

The ICE SHIFTS

BEN
Griggs Keep moving

Griggs doesn’t move too distracted by what he’s seeing

GRIGGS
What the fuck

Ben finally follows Griggs’ gaze

ON THE MAGGIE MAY - IN THE DISTANCE

A FIGURE stands on the nearly horizontal wheelhouse
A MANdark against the blue skyGHOSTLIKE

ON NATE -

He sees the same Figure appear at the Maggie May
BACK ON GRIGGS AND BEN -

Something glints near the Figure’s ‘face’

GRIGGS (CONT’D)
Is that -

SW-FFFFFTTHUMP

A CLOUD OF BLOOD AND FEATHERS ERUPTS FROM THE BACK OF GRIGGS’
DOWN JACKET

the CRACK of the distant rifle finally catches up to its
destruction a split second later

as both Ben and Griggs stare in disbelief at a large
bloody hole in Griggs’ chest

The snow behind Griggs resembles a modern-art blood slushy
ON NATE

He reacts to the rifle’s reportECHOING ACROSS THE ICE

He watches Griggs’ body fall to its knees in the snow

ON BEN

SW-FFFFT A bullet SMACKS into the boxcar beside Ben’s head
He dives behind the barrier as TWO MORE ROUNDS hit the ice
--AND THE RAFTSPUNCTURING THEM

AIR HISSES from the heavy rafts as Ben cowers

TWENTY FEET AWAY -

FISSURES FORM IN THE ICE AROUND GRIGGS’ RAFT

Griggs still on his knees weakly tries to standblood
frothing at his lips

EXT MAGGIE MAY - CONTINUOUS

Standing on the upended port side rail of the sinking
shipA MAN in black arctic gear and mirrored sunglasses
holds a SNIPER RIFLE WITH SCOPE

Beside him a MAN IN A BASEBALL CAP uses binoculars to act as
spotter

REVEAL BEHIND HIM -—

ANOTHER SHIP has pulled in just behind the sinking Maggie
MayCyrillic name on its bow The ship is hidden from the
view of the Americans on the ice

The ship is nearly as wrecked as the Maggie Maywith the
exception that it’s still afloat The storm wasn’t kind to
the Russians either

A HALF-DOZEN EXHAUSTED ARMED MEN stand on the bow a few
chuckle as they watch ONE OF THEIR COMRADES CONTINUOUSLY
PUKING OVER THE SIDE

They all wear high-end arctic gear carry assault rifles
These guys have come loaded for bear

They make our dead Russians look like errand boys
ON THE MAGGIE MAY

The Leader cocks an eyebrow

SNIPER (CONTD)

The Leader nods Wordlessly steps onto the ice

The rest of his men follow his lead onto the ice trudging
towards Ben’s position

ON GRIGGS

He’s alive Barely His eyes widen as he hears the SOUND OF
CRACKING ICE

Griggs looks to the raft just as -

THE OVERLADEN DEFLATED RAFT PUNCHES THROUGH THE ICE AND
FALLS THROUGH INTO THE DARK WATER

BEN watches helplessly from behind cover as Griggs’ HARNESS
GOES TAUT

Griggs’ eyes go wide as a quarter ton of treasure YANKS HIM
OFF HIS KNEES and across the ice -

Griggs leaves a RED STREAK as he’s dragged towards the edge
by the sinking raft -

GRIGGS
NO -

And then Griggs is gone over the jagged lip
CLOSE ON THE ICE HOLE

We get one last glimpse of Griggs’ horrified face UNDER THE
FRIGID WATER before he disappears in the inky darkness

ON BEN

As he looks around the boxcar to see half a dozen armed men
moving across the ice towards him

He looks to his raftrapidly deflating and lopsided

THE ICE BEGINS TO CRACK from the dead weight

HE PULLS ON HIS ROPES as hard as he cantrying to pull the
quarter-ton of loot towards him away from the breaking ice
and out of the line of fire

ON NATE

He’s been watching the scene unfold from the shadow of the
island

Nate’s only a few hundred yards from warmth and safety - the
Russians seem to have no idea he’s even there

ON THE RUSSIANS
They jog in a line towards Ben’s hiding spot

LEADER
Hold your fire The ice is fragile -

A COCKY RUSSIAN UNLOADS HIS CLIP AT THE RAFT AND THE ICE
SHIELDING BEN

The Sniper and Baseball Cap shake their heads in frustration
ON BEN

He cringes as the gunfire CRACKS around him - hitting the
raft multiple times and speeding up the deflation

BEN STRAINS as he hauls on the ropesbut it’s a losing
battle as the ice cracks more -

He finally pulls the shotgun places it over the edge of the
boxcar

ON THE RUSSIANS

As the Sniper sees the barrel of the shotgun first

BOOM - BOOM

Baseball Cap is hit in the leg by the spray

The Russians scatter taking cover behind broken ice berms
ON BEN

He looks to the raft of lootEXPOSED IN THE OPEN

Ben looks back to the ice berms and boxcars where the
Russians have ducked out of sight

back to the sinking lockboxes

Ben takes a deep breath Puts the shotgun down - AND DIVES
FOR THE RAFT

ON THE RAFT

He leaps for an exposed lockbox -

ON THE RUSSIANS

The Cocky Russian peeks over his berm spots Ben
He FIRES -

STRIKING BEN IN THE SIDE

As Ben is blown backwards from the raft - STRAY DIAMONDS
SCATTER AMIDST THE SNOW AND ICEnow indistinguishable

Ben’s body strikes the ice around the raft -

WITH A TREMENDOUS CRACK - THE ICE FINALLY BREAKS FREE

The raft begins to sink into the icy water below

Ben weakly crawls behind the berm bleeding out over the
white

ON THE RUSSIANS
The Leader watches the raft falling into the water
He shakes his head at Cocky

LEADER (CONTD)
Idiot

Cocky rises up - testing to see if Ben will return fire
Nothing

COCKY
He’s down It’s ours

The rest of the men cautiously eye the cracking ice
ON BEN
Weakly dragging himself away from the raft

But the weight of the raft is sinking furtherpulling the
harness ropes into the water

And dragging Ben towards the RAPIDLY GROWING HOLE as well
Lockboxes are no longer visible SINKING BELOW THE ICE LINE

BEN
No no no no -

He tries to reach HIS KNIFE strapped to his ankle -

SUDDENLY THERE’S HANDS UNDER HIS ARMSfighting to pull him
from the raft

Ben looks up - finds Nate there

BEN (CONTD)
MY ANKLEMY ANKLE -

Nate grabs the knife starts sawing at the ropes
ON THE RUSSIANS

Cocky calmly walks towards Ben’s cover the injured man’s
legs sliding towards the hole in the ice

He smirks sadistically Unafraid full of bravado
He fires haphazardly around Ben’s exposed legs
ON NATE AND BEN

Nate ducks as gunfire peppers the ice

Ben SCREAMS IN PAIN as he’s struck in the leg
Nate sees Ben’s shotgun

ON COCKY

Moving fearlessly gun aimed at where he believes

Until Nate appears aiming at him from the top of
berm

Cocky pauses in surprise

BOOM

The cocky Russian gets both barrels in the chest
He’s blown backwards to the snow by the blast

ON THE RUSSIANS

Ben to be

No one seems to carea few chuckle to themselves

LEADER
You said there were only two

The Sniper shrugs

SNIPER
I was wrong

A few more chuckles from the group

BASEBALL CAP
Fuck him

No one disagrees

He nods his men to the right and the leftthey begin
scrambling from berm to berm - moving to flank Nate and Ben

ON NATE AND BEN

Nate peeks his head above the boxcarglimpses the Russians

moving to surround them

ROUNDS SMACK INTO THE ICE around his head

He ducks back down for cover once again

Ben bleeds out beside him finally cut free of the sinking
raft - which he still watches forlornly

He looks to Ben - whose attention is elsewhere

NATE
This count as dying at sea

Ben looks at him for a beatthen WHEEZES OUT A LAUGH
-until blood froths at his lips
Nate watches him resigned to their shared fate

BEN
Thanks for coming back

Ben smilesBLOOD STAINS HIS TEETH

NATE
Bet you feel like a douchebag

Ben stares at him for a beat

BEN
What did you mean

NATE
Huh

BEN

NATE
Forget I said it

Ben grabs him as he coughs up more blood

NATE (CONTD)
I was just helping the old man out
Never thought I’d be tossed in
jail
(beat)
Wonderful ain’t it

Ben digests it allcan’t believe the truth

BEN
And no one else knew
NATE
Well
(beat)
Sol
Ben goes quiet
ON THE RUSSIANS
They’re circling in on Ben and Nate
Baseball Cap is parallel to them limping behind cover
ON NATE AND BEN
Nate spots Baseball Cap
He racks the shotgun raises itFIRES OFF BOTH BARRELS
It hammers the ice - pushing Baseball Cap back and away
ON THE RUSSIANS
They all duck and cover behind their berms

ON BEN AND NATE

Another Russian pops up to the other side of their cover
FIRES at them

Nate FIRES OFF ONE ROUNDpushing the Russian back
Then CLICK

He pulls Ben behind more cover as the Russian unloads
Ben and Nate cower under the spray of ice

ON THE SNIPER AND THE LEADER

The Sniper angles for a head shot on Natewho bounces in
and out of the crosshairs

Whenout of the silence of the ice field
WHUMP-—WHUMP-—WHUMP-WHUMP
All eyes go to the sky

IN THE DISTANCETHE TINIEST TRACE OF A HELICOPTER MOVING
OVER OPEN OCEAN IN THEIR DIRECTION

ON NATE AND BEN
Nate’s suddenly got a light back in his eyes
NATE (CONTD)
that is the sweetest fucking
sound I’ve ever heard
Ben is HACKING UP BLOODhis face a pasty white
ON THE RUSSIANS - they all look towards their Leader

The Leader looks to the hole where the lockboxes have long
since sunken back into the Bering Sea

LEADER
Mark the spot It will still be
here after the thaw
He gets up starts moving back in the direction of his ship

However the Sniper lingersNate finally in his sights

LEADER (CONTD)
Now

The Sniper sighs in frustrationdoes as he’s told
Nate is spared

ALL OF THE RUSSIANS ABANDON THEIR POSITIONS FOLLOW THEIR
LEADER BACK TO THEIR SHIP

-As the helicopter grows loudermore defined in the sky
as it approaches

ON NATE AND BEN

Nate watches the Russians retreating He seeks out the rescue
chopper in the sky

CUT TO

INT COAST GUARD HELICOPTER - LATER
THE ENGINE AND WIND NOISE IS UNBEARABLY LOUD

The PILOT and COPILOT maneuver through the low clouds of a
newly gathering storm

TWO MEDICS hover over Benadministering first aid

Swaddled in blankets Nate observes from the corner as they
stabilize his brother
It’s rough but Ben’s going to live
Nate’s eyes fill with emotion as he reaches for Ben’s hand

Tears stream from his eyes as they fall on Ben’s clothing
stripped and laying in a pile at his feet

Something GLINTS in the fading sunlight

He slowly reaches outgrabs Ben’s jacketlooks inside a
pocket

CLOSE ON NATE’S FACEspeckled sunlight reflected back onto
his face -

REVEAL a large pile of DIAMONDS

Nate stares at them for a beat mesmerizedwhat’s he going
to do

He looks to Ben they lock eyes for a LONG BEAT
--and Nate ZIPS THE POCKET

Nate pulls the jacket closer protectively as he looks out
the window to the gathering storm

CUT TO

EXT ATTU ISLAND - DUSK

WIND AND DARK CLOUDS signal a gathering storm

CLOSE ON the last bit of the Maggie May the FADED FAMILY
CREST over the wheelhouse windowsfinally slips below the

water line

CUT TO BLACK
