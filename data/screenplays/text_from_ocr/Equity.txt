INT NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE MORNING 1

A sea of people BUZZING in excitement -- reporters
officials men in dark suits Occasional flashes of color as
women in brighter attire elbow through the crowd Screens

exchange is actually happening on a TV screen

of the crowd

cheering just now I think we had

climb to 47--

those guys didn’t you

She meets his gaze Around them chopsticks fly over colorful

Listen Doug I’ve taken 9 Silicon
Valley companies public in the last
five years You want to talk about
the one I didn’t take to the finish
line

NAOMI (CONTD)
Here’s what nobody wants to admit
Everything is a judgment call And
yes you need to trust your banker
because this is a partnership You
guys are the innovators who can
build technology the rest of us are
not even imagining But without
funding that’s just tinkering in a
garage I work for the largest
investment bank in the world And
we both know I found you guys
capital when you were a couple of
kids with a laptop and a dream So
we can talk about last year’s IPO
calendar or we can talk about how
to grow your company so you can
build technology that’s going to
transform people’s lives

trembles

RANDALL
Look Naomi I’m going to be frank
with you This doesn’t look like
your year

NAOMI
Because of Dynacorps

RANDALL
I’ve asked around about what

is that you rubbed some people
the wrong way

head the valuation the pricing

A put-

14 Green Rev Naomi Samantha and three other women face the audience

NAOMI
I guess the simplest answer is I
like money

Some people laugh nervously but the women in the audience

are loving this Sam listens

NAOMI (CONTD)
I do I mean that’s the honest
answer I like numbers I like a
challenge I love negotiation But
let’s just be clear I really like
money I like knowing I have it I
grew up without money in a house
where there was never enough I was
raised by a single mom with four
kids I took my first job on Wall
Street so I could pay for my little
brothers to go to college Remson
gave me that chance and I’ve been
there ever since

Naomi sees a woman nodding sympathetically

NAOMI (CONTD)
But I’m not going to stand here and
tell you I only do what I do so I
can take care of other people
Because it is okay to do it for
ourselves For how it makes us
feel Secure Yes Powerful When
you understand VALUE COST what we
will pay for what we will risk
and what we can build That’1l get
you up in the morning

Sam leans forward now intrigued
NAOMI (CONTD)
I’m glad it’s acceptable now for
women to talk openly about
ambition But don’t let money be a
dirty word We can like that too

A less corporate funkier conference room than those we have
seen On the wall a giant gold key made up of lines of code

The CEO ED 29 is flanked by his CFO IAN a numbers wiz
who protects Ed like a younger brother at the head of a
table crowded with casually dressed managers Ed still has
the look of a kid who plays too many video games Restless
energy pulses under his casual exterior

Teddy and Bill distribute pitch books Erin notices that the
pens say “Channing Trust” left behind by the competition
She casually flicks one into a nearby trashcan as Naomi
begins the pitch Naomi lives for this she is in her
element

NAOMI
When I was a kid if you wanted
privacy if you wanted to send a
secret message you made invisible
ink with vinegar

Teddy proudly displays a large seemingly blank piece of
poster board

NAOMI (CONTD)
And when you were ready to “go
public” you revealed your message
with grape juice

Bill takes a large paintbrush dipped in grape juice and
“paints” across the posterboard The Remson logo appears in
purple as he does this

People are nodding smiling They appreciate this touch

Naomi sees Ian and a few others opening the pitch book and
gives a silent go-ahead to Erin Numbers time

ERIN
But Cachet has certainly taken
privacy to the next level and we
are so pleased to have the chance
to foster that growth If you open
your books to page 2 youll see in
the first model that we are
predicting a valuation of 820
million at 34 to 36 a share

Ian and Ed flip through the graphs and models

20 Green Rev IAN
Well you’re certainly presenting
us with some compelling numbers

NAOMI
You guys can see we’ve done our
homework But that’s not why you’re
going to give us this deal

ED
Okay

NAOMI
I remember what you told me the
first day we met we’re not a
social media company with privacy
settings we’re a privacy company
that can build a social network An
impenetrable social network I
understood that The NEED for that
I felt it in my gut Some people
thought you guys were paranoid
investors wouldn’t go for it Now
fast forward Edward Snowden nude
photos of actresses the Sony hack
Your revenue jumps Your
competitors start rolling out But
we were ahead of the curve Because
we understood that every day it
gets harder to trust people in this
world And security is the hottest
commodity around

Others are too

Ed is nodding Ian looks impressed

into the room Naomi notices MARIN a woman with purple hair

whisper something to the CFO and hurry out of the room

Naomi takes a seat next to Ed

NAOMI
Good afternoon everyone We’d like
to start off with a preliminary
discussion of pricing--

ED
Let’s do it Where are we at

NAOMI
At this point we’re looking at a
range of 32 to 34 a share At 72
million shares that gives us a
valuation of 868 million--

IAN
Now just a minute here--

ED
We gotta have a billion valuation

NAOMI
Weve looked at the comparables
and--

ED
You said 34 to 36 in the pitch
You’re going to leave tens of
millions of dollars on the table

IAN
We can get at least 35

Naomi hesitates She needs this to go smoothly

NAOMI
(diplomatically)
Well it’s a balancing act Raising
money for the company while still
promising the investors a deal for
coming on board

A couple of men at the table exchange looks with each other
as things get more heated
36 Green Rev ED
Look you begged me for this IPO
You want me to call Channing Trust

NAOMI
Ed what we want to avoid is a down
round--

ED
We know what happened with your
last IPO

NAOMI

I don’t think that’s relevant here--
All eyes are on Naomi Erin speaks up

ERIN
Ed I believe our goal here is to
find the right number for all of
us

Ed turns to her

ED
The number is 35

Erin glances briefly at Naomi as if asking permission Naomi
nods almost imperceptibly

ERIN
Possibly But you can think of it
like a party We need to encourage
people to show up to the party
Could be the best party in the
world but if nobody shows up--

IAN
A party
NAOMI
We don’t need to--
ED
No hang on I get this A party
Go on--
ERIN

The 32 to 34 range will get
people in the door But if the
party is good enough--

People will line up around the
block

He was not expecting this

MICHAEL
Really Should I phone my lawyer
42 Green Rev SAM
I don’t think that’s necessary I
was just hoping we could have a
brief chat

MICHAEL
Sure That’s my idea of a perfect
summer evening Just a cozy chat
with a long legged woman who just
happens to be FBI

SAM
I didn’t say FBI

He waves towards the street

MICHAEL
No they hang back in the van

SAM
I’m alone And I’m not interested
in you

He leans forward

She nods

MICHAEL
Well that is too bad

SAM
I’m interested in one of your
clients Titanite Benji Akers

MICHAEL
Well I’m not sure how I can help
you My relationship with my
clients is confidential

SAM
Of course But these hedge fund
guys they’ve always got a loophole
some way of staying out of trouble
But they need a guy like you
right at a big bank And you don’t
have so many loopholes You’ve got
regulations compliance looking
over your shoulder handing me
intell So it seems to me that
if anybody’s gonna take the fall
it’s not going to be Benji Acres

MICHAEL
Take the fall for what

43 Green Rev SAM
Exactly Could be anything Could
be a merger last spring when it
seemed like certain investors got
the memo prematurely or a bunch of
trades that compliance flagged as a
irregular

Michael looks at her thoughtfully

MICHAEL
You don’t have anything on me

SAM
How do you know that

MICHAEL
Because we’d be downtown with
wires and somebody in my face This
is just a cozy chat Which I have
certainly enjoyed

He stands up
MICHAEL (CONTD)

Why don’t you call me back when
youve got some leverage

Naomi notices Marin wears a necklace made of shark teeth

MARIN (CONTD)
You guys talk to every single
employee

No You seem particularly
interested in our process In my
experience that usually means you
have something you want to tell us

MARIN
Wow You’re good

to tell us

Marin hesitates

NAOMI (CONTD)
Or you just like my shoes

Marin smiles But then glances around nervously

the thing What happens if it gets
hacked

NAOMI
It’s anonymized and encrypted at
the highest level

MARIN
You haven’t met my ex He’s already
done it once We were beta testing
so it was actually kind of helpful

We plugged the holes
(MORE )
45 Green Rev MARIN (CONTD)
But he’ll keep trying And there
might be others

NAOMI
But why

MARIN
The challenge The naked photos
Who knows

She leans forward and continues quietly

MARIN (CONTD)
It’s called a man in the middle
attack Users want to be able to
access the network on multiple
devices But that opens up the
possibility of somebody implanting
malware on the key server

She looks around the park uneasily

NAOMI
Does Ed know about this

MARIN
He thinks I’m paranoid Which is
pretty funny when a company that’s
built on paranoia thinks youre
paranoid

NAOMI
But why tell me

MARIN
I want to sell my shares You can
help me with that right If this
thing goes south

Naomi laughs

NAOMI
That’s not what I do

MARIN
I got plans I’m starting a
hackerspace

walking by with a big gold key on a necklace

nothing but something’s come up

during due diligence
(MORE)
47 Green Rev NAOMI (CONTD)
A rumor that your network
encrypted as it is might still be
vulnerable to a certain kind of
hacker

Ed smiles warily

ED
Sounds like you met Marin

NAOMI
Yes actually We were interviewing
employees and--

ED
Unfortunately our business can
attract some colorful characters

NAOMI
You need your employees to be as
much a firewall as your code

ED
Look I can promise you we’ve never
been hacked In theory there’s a
backd door to everything But we
stay one step ahead That’s the
game

NAOMI
Terrific

She and Erin smile at him He grins back

relationship

They walk

48 Green Rev NAOMI

Are you going to sleep with him
ERIN

Excuse me
NAOMI

It’s risky territory When he comes
on to you and he will at this
rate you have to let him down very
very gently That’s how you
preserve the relationship

ERIN
Yeah I know how this works

NAOMI
Okay then

in chilly silence

NAOMI (CONTD)
(Coolly) Then maybe you can find a
way to get him to sign an indemnity
clause If there is any
vulnerability for investors here
we can’t be liable

ERIN
I’1l handle it

They are approaching the hotel

NAOMI
And Erin-- keep it quiet There’s
probably nothing here and the last
thing we need is rumors starting

concrete

JOHN
And on paper--

NAOMI
Everything looks perfect Our IT
guys at Remson and they think this

seen

JOHN
So what’s the problem

She looks at him Not sure if she wants to open up But this
is why she’s come

NAOMI
There’s just this nagging
feeling

56 Green Rev JOHN
In your gut

NAOMI
You taught me to trust my gut But
I don’t want to make the wrong move
here

He nods thoughtful

JOHN
That sounds like fear Which is not
the same as instinct You know why
this is a business for the young
It’s not the physical stamina It’s
the complete lack of doubt

NAOMI
So I should keep it going

JOHN
I’m not going to tell you what to
do Naomi But if the numbers
check out then it sounds like
were talking about a rumor here
And rumors they’re the wildcard
You can’t control ‘em And once you
