KITCHEN BILLYS HOUSE AFTERNOON

BILLY a boy 11 plonks two eggs into a saucepan puts
it on the stove and rushes upstairs

BILLY’S ROOM THE SAME

Two single beds A poster of Karl Marx A poster of
Marc Bolan A tattered teddy on one bed The other
unmade BILLY rushes in

BILLY turns on the battered record player It clicks
into action and a record flops onto the turn-table The
music starts COSMIC DANCER by Marc Bolan

CUT TO an empty space on the wall In our vision are
the posters but the effect is rather abstract The
music is playing

“T was a dancer when I was twelve
I was a dancer when I was
twelve”

BILLY’s head moves up into our view in extreme slow
motion BILLY is bouncing up and down on the bed to the
music He is dancing freely we feel his joy and the
freedom of his movement

“T was a dancer when I was out I
was a dancer when I was out”

We gradually PULL OUT to reveal more of him but still
we see his intimate grace as he moves in and out of the
frame seeming to fly like a humming bird almost frozen
in flight

MUSIC
“Danced myself right out the womb
Danced myself right out the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon”

BILLY’s hands lift into an almost balletic position
The extreme slowness and close up is strangely moving
juxtaposed to the Marc Bolan song

MUSIC
“ Danced myself into the tomb Is
it wrong to understand What dwells
inside a man What it’s like to be

Running up the back lane Past the backs of the
terraces and further onto the field at the end of the

FIELD AT THE END OF THE STREET THE SAME

BILLY runs into the long grass To BILLY it is almost a
jungle The camera follows him at his own eye level
running and running as the Marc Bolan track reaches its
climax Through the long grass a figure emerges BILLY
gets closer and we realise it is GRANDMA She is
wearing her night dress and is wandering aimlessly in
the field in a daze BILLY out of breath reaches her
and clings to her side in a desperate cuddle

GRANDMA looks at him incredulously as the music comes
to an end BILLY looks up at his GRANDMA sadly The old
woman is close to tears in her confusion

BILLY looks up at GRANDMA The camera pulls out In the
distance at the brow of the hill we see a police van
with policemen pouring out in riot gear They seem to
be dark crows on the horizon an almost surreal
malevolent prescence quite at odds with the fragility
of BILLY and GRANDMA BILLY starts to lead GRANDMA back

VILLAGE HALL THE SAME

In the hall there is a makeshift boxing ring in the
centre of the room Boys are at one side warming up and
sparring with each other

Along the other side of the hall is a row of nervous
girls all in pink tutus ready to do their dancing
exams We hear the sound of a piano in the other room
GEORGE WATSON addresses the room as he steps into the
ving

GEORGE
As the school hall’s been used as a
dormitory for the pickets from
Kent I have kindly let Mrs
Wilkinson use the room next door
for her ballet exams So I want no
hanky panky Understood

BILLY is peering through the window in the door
obviously watching the girls in the side room doing
their exams He sees MRS WILKINSON She seems like
tough old war horse

GEORGE
Elliot Over here Now

EXT

BILLY goes over to the other side of the hall and
starts hitting a punchbag rather tragically DEBBIE a
plump girl with ginger hair is watching him He is
aware of her attentions and aims to hit harder but the
punchbag rebounds almost knocking him over

The piano music gives a lightness of touch to the grim
surroundings

GEORGE
OK Greaves and Elliot

BILLY goes over to the ring and climbs in He looks
over at GREAVES GREAVES is a fat lad a good few inches
taller than BILLY

GEORGE
Lets be having you
BILLY comes tentatively out of his corner There is a
determination in his face but his punches just don’t
seem to land He gets whacked GEORGE grabs his left
hand

GEORGE
Keep your gloves higher Billy

GEORGE lets them spar again BILLY dances around
lashing out but only hits GREAVES in the stomach It
seems GREAVES has enough padding to resist Mike Tyson
BILLY carries on

GEORGE
Concentrate Elliot This isnt a
bloody tea dance

The door to the side room opens and the music is louder
for a second We hear the sound of a little girl
crying BILLY glances over and catches sight of her
running out of the room in floods of tears He turns
back to GREAVES but we see a huge glove coming straight
towards his face Bang

BILLY is flat out on the ground

GEORGE
For Christsake

BILLY lies there fazed by the punch The girls giggle
BILLY looks round embarrassed DEBBIE is watching him
She smiles and turns away

PICKET LINE LATER

BILLY is with DAD he has a black eye There are a few
men huddled by a burner BILLY has his boxing gloves

BILLY looks at DAD reluctantly DAD gives him a stern
look BILLY jumps down from the pillar-box and walks by
the POLICEMEN on his way home

POLICEMAN
Look it’s Joe Bugner

A SECOND POLICEMAN bends down as if to spar
affectionately with BILLY BILLY simply stares at him
too nervous to join in the game DAD watches from
across the street

POLICEMAN TWO
You’1l not get very far with that
attitude I could have had you

BILLY just stares The POLICEMEN laugh as BILLY runs
off DAD looks on

SCHOOL ROOM MORNING

BILLY is in the class He is sitting next to MICHAEL
They are all listening to the teacher who has a
diagram of the earth on the board She is explaining
what coal is
Last revision April 13 1999

TEACHER
So gradually over hundreds of
thousands of years layer upon
layer pushed the forests down and
the pressure of all this caused the
trees and plants to change Into

coal

SANDRA
So what happened to the dinosaurs
Miss

TEACHER

They became crushed as well
Sometimes if they fell into mud
they were preserved That’s what
fossils are

MICHAEL
(to BILLY)
That must have been what happened
to her

TEACHER
If you have something to say you
can say it to the whole class

MICHAEL
Nothing miss

DICK PEVERLY
Who put the coal there again Miss

TEACHER
Ive just explained No one put the
coal there It was formed by the
forces of nature

DICK PEVERLY
Miss So the coal is just there It
didn’t belong to anyone

TEACHER
It’s just there I suppose it
belongs to whoever dug it out

DICK PEVERLY
The miners

TEACHER
No to the people who owned the
mines

A girl SUSAN stands up

SUSAN
No it didn’t Miss

TEACHER
Of course it did What do you mean
Last revision April 13 1999

SUSAN
Coal is the commonwealth of the
people Miss and its been robbed
by enemies of the working class

TEACHER
I beg your pardon

SUSAN
Weve been exploited by class
interests Miss

TEACHER
Who told you this

SUSAN
My Dad Miss

TEACHER

Well I don’t think we can really
get into that now The coal is
owned by the government

DICK PEVERLY
Miss What about God

TEACHER
What about God

DICK PEVERLY
Didnt God put the coal in the
ground and that

TEACHER
Well I suppose he did in a wider
sense

SUSAN

But God doesn’t exist Miss

TEACHER
That’s merely a matter of opinion

SUSAN
Miss My Dad says God doesn’t exist
and that he was only invented to
prevent people from realising their
own potential

The poor teacher is totally defeated and decides to
change the subject

TEACHER
Class Time is pressing on Open
your books and copy this diagram
You have five minutes

SUSAN
But it’s true Miss isn’t it that
God never really existed

trooper

and work harder

They are now moving across the room The camera is low
down moving amongst the kids to really capture the
effort of their movement We feel the concentration and
the nerves We move with BILLY through the exercise he
is trying hard ignoring the girls Who now seem to be
taking him more seriously The PIANIST is playing
passionately - a long end of ash is hanging from his
cigarette

WILKINSON
Really stretch and keep your head
straight up Look where you are
looking Good next group

He is still stony faced with concentration

And finally I want to do a little
bit of freestyle I just want you
to move to the music

The music starts and BILLY starts dancing rather
falteringly MRS WILKINSON suddenly sees something in
BILLY and focuses in on him He is clearly on to
something BILLY feels like hes getting somewhere

MRS WILKINSON
At least look like youre enjoying
it

This spurs BILLY on and he suddenly lets go and we
suddenly see his immense talent As he jetées across
the floor we see his face break out into a huge grin

I don’t really miss her as such
Its more like just feeling sad
Specially when I remember her all
of a sudden when Id forgot she was
dead and that What about your Mam
Does she not have sex

DEBBIE
No She’s unfulfilled That’s why
she does dancing

BILLY
She does dancing instead of sex

DEBBIE comes closer to BILLY He seems uneasy with her
advance

BILLY
Youre family’s weird

DEBBIE
No theyre not

BILLY
They are though Theyre mental

BILLY surprises DEBBIE by hitting her on the head with
a pillow DEBBIE scrambles for a pillow to hit BILLY
back but this just presents an opportunity for BILLY to
bash her a few more times DEBBIE retaliates and BILLY
yelps and jumps back They both end up on the bed
having a pillow fight BILLY hits her His pillow
bursts and feathers scatter everywhere DEBBIE screams
BILLY is on top of her

stares at him intently BILLY is very uneasy for a

surveys the debris DEBBIE is hurt by this moment of
rejection but is trying hard not to show it

fascinating mosaic of haplessness
