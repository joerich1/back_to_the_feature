INDIANS with torches surround the hourglass which now

BIG THUMBS
INT RICHMOND VIRGINIA SUBURBAN HOME DAY
We see CANDLES burning on a cake It is somebodys
And there are six candles on the cake
SISSY HANKSHAW is six years old
Her DADDY and a visiting UNCLE finishing their
Happy Birthday are staring down at Sissy and looking
young THUMBS WHICH ARE UNUSUALLY LARGE and twitch with
mind of their own
She manages to blow out all six candles

UNCLE
Well youre lucky that you dont
suck em

DADDY
Sissy couldnt suck em shed need
a mouth like a fish tank

Sissy is negotiating a fork full of birthday cake
dropping
it because of her thumbs

UNCLE

(agrees)
The poor little tyke might have a
hard time finding herself a hubby
But as far as getting along in the
world its a real blessing that
Sissys a girl-child Lord I reckon
this youngun would never make a
mechanic

DADDY
Nope and not a brain surgeon
neither

UNCLE
Course shed do pretty good as a
butcher She could retire in two
years on the overcharges alone

Laughing the men walk to the kitchen to fill their
glasses

Sissy is left to feel sorry for herself in front of her
cake

UNCLE (0S)
One thing that youngun would make
one hell of a hitchhiker

This startles Sissy A new word that tinkles in her
head
with a supernatural echo Sissy looks at her thumbs

UNCLE (0S)
if she was a boy I mean

INT DOCTORS OFFICE DAY
Dr Dreyfus looks over Sissys thumbs

DR DREYFUS
She is if I may speak frankly
short

phalanges and

movement

right

somewhat of a medical oddity Due to
impaired dexterity her life
activities and career potentialities
will be reduced It could be worse
Bring her back to me if there ever
is pain Meanwhile she will have to
learn to live with them

MRS HANKSHAW
That she will That she will The
Lord made them things big for a
purpose God dont never git tired
of testing our kind Its a punishment
of some sort for what I dont rightly
now

(whimpering)
Oh Doc if a young man ever shows up
here with a young man with ugly
fingers you know something similar
a similar case Doc would you
please

DR DREYFUS

Remember the words of the painter
Paul Gauguin dear lady The ugly
may be beautiful the pretty never
dont suppose that means very much
to you

MRS HANKSHAW
ts a judgement Shes gotta bear
the punishment

Sissy beams serenely like a Christ figure

Sissy runs actually sweating to its side She peers

OUTSIDE a palmists trailer is a sign with a red

of a hand

Directly under the wrist where the watch band would be
written MADAME ZOE

Madam Zoe in kimono and wig lets Sissy and her mother
door

MADAME ZOE
I am the enlightened Madame Zoe

Inside Madame Zoe begins stubbing a cigarette in one
those enlightened little ceramic ashtrays that are
like bedpans and inscribed BUTTS The trailer is

but not one knick-knack chintz curtain or chenille-
armchair seems to have come from the Beyond

MADAME ZOE
There is nothing about your past
present or future that your hands do
not know and there is nothing about
your hands that Madame Zoe does not
know There is no hocus-pocus
involved I am a scientist not a
magician I Madame Zoe chiromancer
lifelong student of the moldings and
markings of the human hand I Madame
Zoe to whom no facet of your
character or destiny is not readily
revealed I am prepared to

Then she notices the thumbs
MADAME ZOE
Jesus fucking Christ

Mrs Hankshaw and the fortune-teller turn pale and

uncertain

while Sissy recognizes with a faint smile that she is
in

command

Sissy extends the thumbs as an ailing aborigine might
extend

his swollen parts to a medical missionary Sissys mama
draws

a neatly folded five-dollar bill from her change purse
and

extends it alongside her smiling daughters
extremities

Madame Zoe returns to her senses and takes Sissy by
the

elbow to sit at a For mica-topped table of
undistinguished

design

Madam Zoe holds Sissys hands while she appears to go
into a

trance
She opens her eyes momentarily

MADAME ZOE
You have a strong will Will power
and determination are indicated by
the first phalanx The second phalanx
indicates reason and logic You
obviously have both in large supply
Whats your name dearie

SISSY
Sissy

MADAME ZOE
Hmmm Id say that you have an
intelligent kindly somewhat artistic
nature However Sissy however
there is a heavy quality to the second
phalanx- the phalanx of logic --
that indicates a capacity for foolish
or clownish behavior a refusal to
accept responsibility or to take
things seriously and bent to be
disrespectful of those who do Your
mama tells me that youre pretty
well behaved and shy but Id watch
out for signs of irrationality All
right

She pulls her thumb to her breast

MADAME ZOE
I guess the most important aspect of
your thumbs is the ahem over all
size Uh what was it do you know
that caused

Mom speaks out from the couch she is sitting on

MRS HANKSHAW
Dont know the doctors dont know

SISSY
Just lucky I guess

MADAME ZOE
Do you study history in school
Galileo Descartes Newton Lebinitz
had very large thumbs Voltaires
were enormous but heh heh just
pickles compared with yours

SISSY
What about Crazy Horse

MADAME ZOE
Crazy Horse You mean the Indian
Nobody that Ive ever heard of ever
troubled to study the paws of savages
Well I guess that about covers the
three-fifty charge

Madame Zoe lets go of Sissys thumbs and wipes her
hands on

her kimono

MRS HANKSHAW

Mrs Hankshaw withdraws a bill from her rat-skin bag

MADAME ZOE
Beg your pardon

MRS HANKSHAW

MADAME ZOE
Oh I see

Madame Zoe takes Sissys hand and gives it the old
stranger squint
MADAME ZOE

I see men in your life honey I

also see women lots of women
She raises her eyes to meet Sissys looking for an
of the tendency but there is no signal
Mrs Hankshaw does not approve

MADAME ZOE

A husband no doubt about it though

he is years away There are children

too Five maybe six but the husband

is not the father They will inherit

your characteristics
Mrs Hankshaw aghast has heard plenty and she ushers
daughter out of the trailer as if she were leading her
a burning cocktail lounge

of the ranch reads
Welcome to the Rubber Rose Ranch

(the largest all-girl ranch in the west)

Delores del Ruby arrives at the Rubber Rose Ranch

a whip at her side and batting an educated lash at the
surrounding sights

From the look of her Sissy is a very seasoned

and she turns around relatively unimpressed with the
that a car has stopped for her

saxaphones in the back seat He wears a gardenia in his

Sissy gets in
He turns up the volume of his radio and rockets north
INT LINCOLN CONTINENTAL DAY

Sissy ventures into her pocket and pulls out a slice of

cheese
and offers it to him He now gets a better look at her
unusual
thumbs They are elegant but large boned and
disproportionate They are banana shaped boats that
makes it
a little awkward to hold onto the cheese

(taking an alarming
interest in her thumbs)
Thanks

Im the best

MAN
Youre the best

SISSY
When I was younger I hitchhiked one
hundred and twenty-seven hours without
stopping without food or sleep
crossed the continent twice in six
days cooled my thumbs in both oceans
and caught rides after midnight on
unlighted highways

MAN
Whooee

SISSY
As I developed however I grew more
concerned with subtleties and nuances
of style Time in terms of MPH no
longer interested me I began to
hitchhike in something akin to
geological time slow ancient vast
When I am really moving stopping
car after car after car moving so
freely so clearly so delicately
that even the sex maniacs and the
cops can only blink and let me pass
then I embody the rhythms of the
universe I am in a state of grace

Sissy at the window picking up some mail and opening a
lavender colored letter that reeks of perfume she is
surprised to read this

Sissy Precious Being How are you my extraordinary
worry so Next time you are near Manhattan do ring me

-The Countess

Sissy looks at the envelope and return address

INT TRUCKERS CAB NIGHT

Sissy is talking to a trucker as they pass down the
road

SISSY
Right off I dont remember how old
I was when I found out I was part
Indian My mammas family a lot of
them had lived out West in the
Dakotas and one of them had married
a squaw Siwash tribe My pleasure
in Indianhood and my passion for car
travel might be incongruous if not
mutually exclusive After
all the first car that ever stopped
for me had been named in honor of
the great chief of the Ottawa
Pontiac

In the distance Sissy spies her destination NEW YORK
CITY

SISSY
NEW YORK CITY Its still a helluva
town

Sissy gets out of the truck and looks up at a large
building

decanter

THE COUNTESS
Take a load off those lovely tootsies
Yes sit right down Would you fancy
some sherry

The decanter is empty a stiff fly lies feet up on its
lip

THE COUNTESS
Shit O goodness Im all out of

He reaches into a midget refrigerator beside his desk

and
pulls out some pop wine
THE COUNTESS
You know what Red Ripple is dont
you Its Kool-Aid with a hard on
Tee Hee
Sissy manages a polite smile She looks at a heavily
finger

printed glass

THE COUNTESS

(he toasts)
To my own special Sissy Cheers And

Lake City La Conner Well I may
have a little surprise for you But

SISSY
Tired

THE COUNTESS
Thats the very first time in the
eons that Ive known you that Ive
ever heard you complain And now
youre tired poor darling

sIssy
A born freak can only go uphill

THE COUNTESS
Freak schmeek Most of us are freaks
in one way or another Try being
born a male Russian countess into a
white middle class Baptist family in
Mississippi and youll see what I
mean

SISSY
Ive always been proud of the way
nature singled me out Its the people
who have been deformed by society I
feel sorry for Ive been steady
moving for eleven years and some
months Maybe I should rest up for a
spell Im not as young as I used to
be

THE COUNTESS
Shit O goodness you wont be thirty
for another year and youre more
beautiful than ever

SISSY
Does that mean you might have an

assignment for me

The Countess taps his monocle with his cigarette

holder He

looks on his wall and on a poster advertising a
feminine

hygene product Yoni Yum Dew Spray stands Sissy
Hankshaw

her thumbs neatly hidden chopped off by the borders of
the

photograph

THE COUNTESS

You were the Yoni Yum girl from
lets see

(peruses the ad layouts

on the wall)
from nineteen sixty-eight through
nineteen seventy Youve always
smelled so nice Like a little sister
The irony has just killed me You
the Dew Girl one of the few girls
who doesnt need Dew I loath the
stink of females They are so sweet
the way God made them then they
start fooling around with men and
soon theyre stinking Like rotten
mushrooms like an excessively
chlorinated swimming pool like a
tuna fishs retirement party They
all stink From the Queen of England
to Bonanza Jellybean they stink

SISSY
Bonanza Jellybean

THE COUNTESS
What Oh yes Tee-hee Jellybean
The Countesss jaw muscles calm down his dentures ease
into
a samba

THE COUNTESS

Shes a young thing who works on my
ranch Real name is Sally Jones or
something wooden like that Shes
cute as a hot fudge taco and of
course it takes verve to change
ones name so charmingly But she
stinks like a slut just the same

SISSY
Your ranch

THE COUNTESS
Oh my dear yes I bought a little
ranch out West sort of a tribute to
the women of America who have
cooperated with me in eliminating
their odor by using my vaginal
products Dew spray mist and Yoni
Yum spray powder A tax write-off
actually

He looks out his window as a squirrel crosses Park
Avenue

THE COUNTESS
Sissy Sissy blushing bride you
can desist from wearing paths in
those forgotten highways The Countess
has arranged a job for you And what
a job

SISSY
A job for me

THE COUNTESS
I am once more about to make
advertising history And only you
the original Yoni YumDew Girl could
possibly assist me

The Countess hands Sissy an article that she reads
clenched
in her fist

SISSY
The Food and Drug Administration
said Wednesday female deodorant sprays
may cause such harmful reactions as
blisters burns and rashes Although
the FDA judges that the reported
reactions are not sufficient to
justify removal of these products
from the market they are sufficient
to warrant the proposed mandatory
label warnings

THE COUNTESS
Shit O dear thats enough to make
me asthmatic The nerve of those
twits What do they know about female
odor Dont interrupt Heres my
concept My ranch out West Its a
beauty ranch Oh its got a few
head of cattle for atmosphere and
tax purposes But its a beauty ranch
a place where unhappy women --
divorcees and widows mainly -- can
go to lose weight remove wrinkles
change their hair styles and pretty
themselves up for the next
disappointment My ranch is named
the Rubber Rose after the Rubber
Rose douche bag my own invention
and bless its little red bladder
the most popular douche bag in the
world So get this Its on the
migratory flight path of the whooping
cranes The last flock of wild
whooping cranes left in existence
Well these cranes stop off at my
little pond -- Siwash Lake its
called -- twice a year autumn and
spring and spend a few days each
time resting up eating doing
whatever whooping cranes do Ive
never seen them understand but I
hear theyre magnificent Very big
specimens -- I mean huge mothers --
and white as snow to coin a phrase
except for black tips on their wings
and tail feathers and bright red
heads Now whooping cranes in case
you didnt know it are noted for
their mating dance Its just the
wildest show in nature
Its probably the reason why
birdwatching used to be so popular
with old maids and deacons Picture
these rare beautiful gigantic birds

in full dance -- leaping six feet
off the mud arching their backs
flapping their wings strutting low
to the ground Dears its
overwhelming And picture the birds
doing their sex dance on TV Right
there on the home screen creations
most elaborate sex ritual -- yet
clean and pure enough to suit the
Pope With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in
the foreground In a white gown red
hood attached and big feathery
sleeves trimmed in black In a very
subdued imitation of the female
whooping crane she dancewalks over
to a large nest in which there sits
a can of Yoni Yum And a can of Dew
Off-camera a string quartet is
playing Debussy A sensuous voice is
reading a few poetic lines about
courtship and love Are you starting
to get it Doesnt it make the hair
on your neck stand up and applaud
My very goodness gracious Grandiose
lyrical erotic and Girl Scout-
oriented you cant top it Ive
hired a crew of experts from Walt
Disney Studios the best wildlife
cinematographers around Youre my
eternal favorite Princess Grace
herself couldnt be better not even
if she had your personality which
she doesnt Anyway dear Im out
of photography now and into water
colors Ah how circuitous conversation
is Were back at the beginning The
exact man Ive wanted you to meet is
my artist the watercolorist

Sissy dares a sip of Red Ripple

SISSY
If you dont want me to pose for
him why do you want me to meet him

THE COUNTESS
Purely personal I believe you might
enjoy one another

SISSY
But Countess
THE COUNTESS
Now now Dont get exasperated I
realize that youve always avoided
all but the most rudimentary
involvements with men and I might
add youve been wise Heterosexual
relationships seem to lead only to
marriage For men marriage is a
matter of efficient logistics The
male gets his food bed laundry
TV pussy offspring and creature
comforts all under one roof where
he doesnt have to dissipate his
psychic energy thinking about them
too much then he is free to go out
and fight the battles of life which
is what existence is all about But
for a woman marriage is surrender

The Countess refills his glass The squirrel starts

across

Park Avenue again but doesnt make it The uniformed
chauffeur

gets out of a limousine and holds the crushed animal up
where

it can be seen by an elderly woman passenger

THE COUNTESS
But here you are still a virgin --
you are virginal yet arent you

SISSY
Why yes technically Jack Kerouac
and I came awfully close but he was
afraid of me I think

THE COUNTESS
Yes well what Im getting at is
that there comes a time when it is
psychologically impossible for a
woman to lose her virginity She
cant wait too long you know Now
theres no reason why you must lose
yours I mean just ponder it a bit
thats all

SISSY

What makes you think this

the point in it but Ill try it
Just for you Its kind of silly
actually me going out with an artist
in New York City However

THE COUNTESS
Good good good youll enjoy it
youll see Julian is a gentleman

Suddenly the Countess swivels in his desk chair and

forward Lowering his wine glass he focuses directly
intensely into Sissys blue eyes His smile widens

The cowgirls frolic until as suddenly as it has come

You know asthma attacks are brought

Carla nods Everyone is piling into the taxi
RUPERT
Come on Sissy dont be afraid of

SISSY
Ive never ridden in a cab The whole
idea of paying for a ride makes my

should have become a doctor
Sometimes though I feel that pushing
books is a whole lot like pushing
medicine Think of books as pills I
have pills that cure ignorance and
pills that cure boredom I have pills
to elevate moods and pills to open
peoples eyes to the awful truth

CARLA
Too bad you dont have a pill for
bullshit

Carla smiles as if she were joking but shed said it
Rupert glares and takes a big bite of Scotch

HOWARD
(changing the subject)
Where do you live Miss Hankshaw

SISSY
Im staying with the Countess

HOWARD
I know but where do you reside when
you arent visiting New York

SISSY
I dont

HOWARD
You dont

SISSY

Well no I dont reside anywhere in
particular I just keep moving

Everyone looks a bit astonished including the recumbent
Julian

HOWARD
A traveler eh

SISSY
You might say that although I dont
think of it as traveling

CARLA
How do you think of it
SISSY
As moving
CARLA
Oh
MARIE
How unusual
HOWARD
Mmmmm

Rupert bites into his Scotch again Julian issues a
watery
wheeze Then silence

CARLA
Rupert before you get too engrossed
in your research on Scotch as a cure
Which

dart

sits

the

so

mortar

Sissy

for aging dont you think youd
better phone Elaines and cancel our
dinner reservations
Sissy leaves her chair and wanders about the apartment
is full of books and shelves
RUPERT (0S)
What would we do without you Carla
Without our little efficiency expert
Carla everything would just go to
hell Carla is thinking about running
for mayor next year arent you
Carla
CARLA (0S)
Up yours Herr Doktor Book Salesman
Will the demands of your medical
practice allow you to call Elaines
or shall I

MARIE (0S)
Oh let me do it

Sissy is intrigued by an antique here and an object
there but she knows she is in an alien environment
INT JULIANS BEDROOM NIGHT
Sissy enters a bedroom There is a covered birdcage She
upon the bed listening for a cheep from the birds
And gradually she reclines Then turning her head to
side against the bedspread
SISSY

No Indian blankets no Indian

blankets
And she blacks out And the sound drifts away in waves
there is only the whistle of a distant wind through the
of the apartment building
Until one by one we see button necks freed Soon

can feel it
Someone is undressing her In a voice webby with sleep

she
lifts her head up and sees Howard and Marie
SISSY
Where are the others
HOWARD
Oh Rupert and Carla had a little
hassle and went home
MARIE
Julian fell asleep on the couch we
covered him up
HOWARD
We thought that we should make you
comfortable too
Sissy thinks this is nice but wonders however why
they
are both in their underwear
SISSY
Yes thanks
Between the two of them they have gotten Sissy out of
her
dress in no time Sissy feels she should apologize for
not
having on a brassiere
Marie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare
bosom
close to Sissys
MARIE
Mine are fuller but yours are more
perfectly shaped
HOWARD
Highly debatable Ill wager theyre
the exact same size
Howard cups his left hand about a Marie breast and his
right
about one of Sissys He weighs them in his palms
squeezes
them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water
from a

lettuce and spreads his fingers to sample their
circumference

HOWARD
Hmm Yours are larger Marie but
Miss Hankshaws -- Sissys -- are

more firm Youd think they would
have started to droop I mean from
not wearing a bra

MARIE
Howard Watch your manners Youve
made her blush Here Sissy let me
compare

Marie seizes Sissys free breast quickly like a

monkey

picking a fruit rolling it about in her hungry little
finger

rubbing it against her chin and cheeks

sand
it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker
nostalgic tropical plums
SISSY
(in ecstasy)
This place is finer than the place I
live

Like a disc jockey from Paradise Howard flips Marie
over

and plays her B side Every now and then she reaches
for

Sissy to include her but the laws of physics insist on
being

obeyed

Over and over Marie calls Sissys name with half-closed
eyes

The Barths are really going at it Marie yowling like a
cat

The POODLE in the kitchen begins to growl
SISSY
So this is what its like so this

is what its really like

INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
Sissy bounces out of the bed and patters through the
living

room and crawls under the cover with Julian Julian
stirs

awake

JULIAN
Oh Sissy I am sorry about all the
fuss

Julian and Sissy embrace and go at it under the covers
But
suddenly Julian stops after a brief climax

JULIAN
(with downcast eyes)
I apologize

Sissy cradles Julian and comforts him

JULIAN
It is the measure of Western
Civilization that it can encompass
in harmony balance off as it were
such divergent masterworks as A
MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM and THE
AMERICAN DREAM as the dome of the
Sistine Chapel and the ceiling of
the Paris opera

Sissy sits up her eyes moping about the apartment
looking

but not seeing the macrame wallhangings the volumes of
Robert

Frost

JULIAN
Whats the matter

After a while Sissy answers

SISSY
Im cold

JULIAN
Here Ill turn down the air
conditioner

SISSY

Its not the air conditioner thats
making me cold Nothing moves in
here Not even your birds
Sissy gets out of bed and begins to dress

JULIAN
What are you doing

SISSY
Getting dressed Ive got to go

JULIAN
But I dont want you to leave Please
stay We can go to dinner I owe you
a dinner And tonight we can
really make love

SISSY
I have to go Julian

JULIAN
Why Why do you have to go

SISSY

(somewhat frantic)
My thumbs hurt Ive made a mistake
Ive been negligent I havent
exercised I have to hitchhike a
little bit every day no matter what
Its like a musician practicing his
scales When I dont practice my
timing gets off my thumbs get stiff
and sore

EXT CITY DAWN
Sissy trembles while she kisses her thumbs

SISSY
I will hitch with you out where
tall birds wade in a lake named for
my Siwash kin Out where Smokey the
Bear lay down his shovel to romp
with more playful beasts Out where
starlight has no enemies and the
badland wind no friends Out where
the boogie stops and the woogie
begins

INT TRUCK DAY
And Sissy is now traveling in a truck passing

Fourteenth
Street on her way to the Geo Washington Bridge
Jersy

West

View of that Bridge as the truck crosses it to New

View of the wilds of New Jersey as Sissy travels to the

INT COUNTESS OFFICE
The Countess is on the phone

THE COUNTESS
So she left town Well that shouldnt
surprise you Leaving town is what
Sissy is all about But tell me how
did she strike you

Julian is on the other end of the phone

JULIAN
Extraordinary

THE COUNTESS
Shes obviously that Jesus Which
would you rather have a million
dollars or one of Sissys thumbs
full of pennies

JULIAN

Oh you Im not talking about her
hands Theyre difficult to ignore
I confess but Im speaking of her
whole being Her whole being is
extraordinary The way she talks
for example Shes so articulate

THE COUNTESS

Its high time you realized honey
babe that a woman doesnt have to
give the best years of her life to
Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak
the English language

JULIAN
Countess Im really in a dither
Shes turned my head

THE COUNTESS
Ninety degrees to the left I hope
How does she feel about you

JULIAN
think shes disappointed that Im
not more ah sort of atavistic
Shes got some naive sentimental
notions about Indians Im sure she
liked me though but then she
left town

THE COUNTESS

She always leaves town you dummy
That doesnt mean anything What
about in bed How does she like it
in bed

Julian pauses for a very long moment

JULIAN
How does she like what in bed

THE COUNTESS
Like what

The Countess teeth chatter in his mouth

THE COUNTESS
What do you think

JULIAN
Well er

THE COUNTESS
Shit O dear Julian Do you mean to
tell me you didnt get it on

JULIAN
Oh we didnt get it all the way on

THE COUNTESS
Whose fault was that

JULIAN
I suppose it was mine Yes it
definitely was my fault

THE COUNTESS

What do they do to you boys in those
Ivy league schools anyway Strap
you down and pump the Nature out of
you They can even press the last
drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck
Why send a shaman or cannibal to
Yale for four years and all hed be
fit for would be a desk in the
military-industrial complex anda

seat in the third row at a Neil Simon
comedy Jesus HMS Christ If
Harvard or Princeton could get hold
of the Chink for a couple of semesters
theyd turn him into a candidate for
the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps
Oogie boogie

JULIAN
If we Ivy Leaguers arent earthy
enough to suit you hillbillies at
least we dont go around indulging
in racist terms such as Chink
Next thing I know youll be calling
me chief

THE COUNTESS
Chinks the guys name for Christs
sake

JULIAN
What guy

THE COUNTESS
Aw hes some old fart holyman who
lives in the hills out West Gives
my ranch the creeps and the willies
too But though he be old and dirty
hes alive Ill bet clear down to
his toes They dont have his juice
in a jar in New Haven Well I suppose
that Ill have to write Sissy out on
the road

EXT ROAD DAY
Sissy makes little puffs of dust as she walks

From the direction of the ranch a VW Microbus is
approaching

It is painted with mandalas lamaistic dorjes and
symbols

representing the clear light of the void

When the Microbus draws alongside Sissy it stops
Inside are

two men and a woman They are approximately twenty-four
years

old

WOMAN
about

had

SSSSSSSSSSSSS

to

has

Are you a pilgrim

SISSY
No Im more of an Indian The trio
doesnt smile

DRIVER
She means are you going to see the
Chink

SISSY

Oh I may and I may not But seeing
him is not my main objective out
here

DRIVER
Thats good Because he wont see
you We came all the way from
Minneapolis to see him and the crazy
bastard tried to stone us to death
OTHER MAN
Yeah but I no longer believe that
guys a master Hes just a dirty
uptight old mountain man Why he
pulled out his pecker and shook it
at Barbara Id stay away from there
if I were you lady
Sissy walks on leaving the people in the bus arguing
whether the Chinks rock-shower and pecker-wag actually
been intended as spiritual messages

EXT ROAD DAY

WALKING down the long dirt road Sissy stops to take a
breather and sits down on a log

Sissy thinking and looking into the clouds

Waves of grasses whisper her name Ssssssssss
Sisssy

Meadowlarks squander their songs on her as she begins
squirm on the log

A Lincoln Continental drives up suddenly Sissy barely
ina

opens

dust

time to zip up

The Cadillac stops in front of Sissy A teenaged girl
Stetson is at the wheel The rear door of the limousine
and a refined matronly voice calls from the void

MISS ADRIAN
By any chance are you Sissy Hankshaw

SISSY
Yes I am

A chic middle-aged woman leans out of the car

MISS ADRIAN
My goodness Why didnt you telephone
Someone would have driven into
Mottburg to pick you up Im Miss
Adrian From the ranch The Countess
wrote that I should expect you Get
in wont you You must be exhausted
Gloria assist Miss Hankshaw with
her luggage

Gloria nods at Sissy amicably but doesnt make a move
help her

Sissy swings her sack into the roomy vehicle Before
gets in she flashes her thumb to hitch a ride

The instant that Sissy shuts the door the cowgirl

floors the Cadillac and it lurches away in a puff of

INT CADDY DAY
Sitting up after the bothersome lurch of the car

MISS ADRIAN

Little twit

(turns to Sissy)
You really ought to have phoned We
were just in Mottburg escorting some
guests to the afternoon train

(sighs)
More guests leaving ahead of schedule
Three checked out today They decided
to transfer to Elizabeth Ardens

Maine Chance spa in Phoenix Arizona
It costs two hundred and fifty dollars
a week less at the Rubber Rose so
why are our guests leaving and going
to Elizabeth Ardens

Miss Adrian pushes a button that sends a partition
glass

between her and the cowgirl driver Gloria starts
laughing

silently on the other side of the glass

MISS ADRIAN
Ill tell you why its that plague
of cowgirls Theyve gradually
infiltrated every sector of our
program The one named Debbie
considers herself an expert on
exercising and diet With Bonanza
Jellybeans permission and against
my explicit orders shes been
coercing the guests into trying
something called kundalini yoga Do
you know what that is Its trying
to mentally force a serpent of fire
to crawl up your spinal column Miss
Hankshaw our guests cant comprehend
kundalini yoga let alone do it
Yesterday she ordered a new cookbook
by a Tibetan Negro entitled Third
Eye in the Kitchen Himalayan Soul
Food God knows what that will be
like The little barbarians are
destroying everything that Ive built
mocking all that the company stands
for And theres a new one one they
call del Ruby She has the good will
of a scorpion Ive considered it
prudent to avoid a confrontation
that might further upset the guests
But now that the season is practically
over -- we operate April through
September -- and the Countess is
finally coming

INT MAIN LODGE DAY
Sissy and Miss Adrian walk through the lodge lobby
and cowgirls are conducting a variety of activities
A BIRD EXPERT projects slides of whooping cranes on the
and is giving a lecture about the habits of the birds
In the center of the room COWGIRL DEBBIE is leading a
of cowgirls and guests in a meditative chant as they
high above their heads in a yoga exercise
Miss Adrian stops in front of the registration desk and
catches glimpses of the chaotic lobby
MISS ADRIAN

Our special guest Miss Sissy Hankshaw
is with us
The receptionist hands Miss Adrian a key to Sissys
room

A COWGIRL makes a face at Sissy as she walks by
carrying a

tray of herbal teas

A representative of the film crew is being intimidated

by a
Cowgirl who is looking though his camera lenses and
shaking
them and listening to them like you would put a shell
up to
your ear to hear the ocean
COWGIRL
Cool Were going to make a movie
Another cowgirl BIG RED is lifting a piece of
furniture
and passes it to her accomplice
BIG RED
Get rid of the furniture its
too masculine Get rid of all the
furniture and use it for kindling
Break away from these pig-like
chauvinist masculine influences
Miss Adrian looks on helplessly she grabs Sissy and
leads
her out of the lobby
EXT CORRAL DAY
Miss Adrian and Sissy walk out the back door of the
Ranch
and out near a corral to the sound of gunfire
MISS ADRIAN
O merciful Jesus Theyre murdering
the guests
One of the FILM CREW MEMBERS is hanging out in the
corral

wearing a shiny jacket with DISNEY printed on the back
Miss Adrian grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him

MISS ADRIAN
Where are the guests
MAN
Take it easy lady They went ona
short ride with the cowgirls Rode
over the hill yonder Youre Miss
Adrian arent you We need to talk
to you about the filming

MISS ADRIAN
Not now you fool not now Those
crazed bitches have led innocent
women out and are slaughtering them
at this moment Well all be killed
Oh Ohhh

Another CAMERAMAN spits out a wad of chewing gum

CAMERAMAN
Theres a slaughter going on all
right but its not the fat ladies
that are getting it Your hired hands
are killing the cattle

MISS ADRIAN
The cattle Theyre killing the cows
All of them

CAMERAMAN
(interrupted while
putting a zoom lens
on his camera)
Thats what they said Miss Adrian

A devilish young cowgirl is sitting on a fence nearby
Miss
Adrian addresses her

MISS ADRIAN
How dare you slaughter the Countesss
cattle What is a ranch without cows

COWGIRL
Were going to replace them with
goats Most of the cattle are diseased
and in pain Were just putting them
out of their misery According to
Bon-an-za Jellybean the Rubber Rose
is in-di-cat-ive of the Countesss
values He has purchased a cheap
weak strain of cow to begin with and
with improper care

A DISTANT COYOTE HOWLS AND A FEW SCATTERED GUNSHOTS
HEARD
INT RANCH COTTAGE MORNING
Sissy stirs in a nicely appointed guest cottage A maid
on the door and serves Sissy breakfast in bed

MAID
Excuse me Miss Do you care for
your breakfast now

Sissy sits up and rubs her eyes

SISSY
Yeah I feel a bit hungry

The Maid puts the tray down and the cloth that covers
food is lifted away to reveal a shocking display of
and calories

A vase of prairie asters stands over a double-meat
cheeseburger a package of Hostess Twinkies a cold can

Dr Pepper and a Three Musketeers bar
Sissy is delighted

SISSY
Road food How did you know

MAID
Well it is a change of our usual
women on

Sissy notices a card It reads
Compliments of Bonanza Jellybean

SISSY
Bonanza Jellybean

MAID
She will be up to see you directly

Sissy devours her meal Out her window she can see
exercycles women doing jumping jacks and women in
parlors
A FIST pounds on Sissys door
IN SAILS Jelly a cowgirl so cute she makes Sissy blush
to look at her She wears a tan Stetson with an aster
to it a green satin shirt embroidered with rearing
snorting orange fire from their nostrils
Her breasts bounce like dinner rolls that have gotten
on helium and between red tinged cheeks where more
fat is taking its time maturing she has a little smile
can cause minerals and plastics to remember their
animate connections
Jelly grasps Sissys elbow and sits on the side of the
JELLY

Welcome podner By God its great

to have you here Its an honor

Sorry I took so long getting to you

but weve had a mess of hard work

these past few days -- and a heap of

planning to do

SISSY

Er you seem to know who I am and
maybe even what I am Thanks for the
breakfast

JELLY
Oh I know about Sissy Hankshaw all
right Ive done a little hitchhiking
myself Ah shucks thats like telling
Annie Oakley youre a sharpshooter
because you once knocked a tomato
can off a stump with a fieldstone
Id heard tales about you from people
Id meet in jail cells and truckstops
I heard about your uh your ah
your wonderful thumbs and I heard
how you were Jack Kerouacs girl
friend

Sissy sets her tray on the bedside table

SISSY
No Im afraid that part isnt true
Jack was in awe of me and tracked me
down We spent a night talking and
hugging in a corn field but he was
hardly my lover Besides I always
travel alone

JELLY

Well that doesnt matter that part
never interested me anyway The
beatnicks were before my time and I
never got anything outta the hippies
but bad dope clichés and the clap
But the example of your life helped
me in my struggle to be a cowgirl

The guests are huffing and puffing in between the
pauses in

conversation in the background through the window in
Sissys

room

SISSY
Tell me about it

JELLY
About

SISSY
About being a cowgirl Whats it all
about When you say the word you
make it sound like it was painted in
radium on the side of a pearl
JELLY
Cowgirls exist as an image A fairly
common image The idea of cowgirls
especially for little girls prevails
in our culture Therefore it seems
to me the existence of cowgirls
should prevail Otherwise theyre
being fooled In the Rodeo Hall of
Fame in Oklahoma City there are just
two cowgirls Two And both of em
are trick-riders Trick-riding is
what cowgirls have almost always
done in rodeos Our society sure
likes to see its unconventional women
do tricks Thats what prostitutes
call it you know tricking

Jelly lays her hand atop the oval mound Sissys thumb
makes
under the covers

SISSY
Youre political then

JELLY
No maam No way Theres girls on
the Rubber Rose who are political
but I dont share their views I got
no cowgirl ideology to expound
Politics is for people who have a
passion for changing life but lack a
passion for living it

There is a moment when the two girls feel something
between
each other

JELLY
Did that last comment sound too
profound to be coming outta my mouth
Its not original Its something I
picked up from the Chink

SISSY
Really The Chink huh Ive gathered
that you sometimes speak with him
What else have you learned from the
Chink

JELLY
Learned from the Chink Oh my Ha
ha Thats hard to say We mostly
Uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy

Jelly pauses

JELLY
Oh yeah now that I think of it the
Chink taught me something about
cowgirls Did you realize that
cowgirls have been around for many
centuries Long before America In
ancient India the care of the cattle
was always left up to young women
hey called gopis Being alone with
he cows all the time the gopis got
wfully horny just like we do here
very gopi was in love with Krishna
good-looking young god who played
he flute like it was going out of
tyle When the moon was full this
rishna would play his flute by a
iver and call the gopis to him
hen he would multiply himself sixteen
housand times -- one for each gopi --
nd make love to each one the way
he most desired There they were
ixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna
n the river bank and the energy of
heir merging was so great that it
created a huge oneness a total union
of love and it was God Wow Quite
a picture huh

tonnwt Hr Hout o soca

Sissys thumb twitches Jelly swallows hard They gaze

into
each others eyes
A WHISTLE pierces the sunlight outside the window
JELLY
That couldnt be Krishna could it
A bit shrill for a flute Just our
rotten luck
Jelly walks to the window and exchanges hand signals
with

someone outside

Gotta run now Delores says Im

the

What was in the center of the circle was a goat Debbie

scratching the animals ears She was hugging it

KYM
Its cute Way cuter than a cow

DEBBIE
Goats are always testing you Theyre
like Zen masters They can tell
instantly if youre faking your
feelings So they play games with
you to keep you true People should
go to goats instead of psychiatrists

GLORIA
Its so loving

Gloria cuts in on Debbie and gives the beast a hug

HEATHER
Look at those playfully wise eyes

GLORIA
Ooo It licked me

JELLY
More and more people are discovering
that cows milk isnt fit for human
consumption Billy West says if we
can produce enough goats milk on
the ranch to make it worth his while
hell run it into Fargo regularly

She pauses and looks around the group in the circle

DELORES
Im aware that Tad Lucas rode broncs
until her ninth month but I dont
think pregnant cowgirls are going to
be any asset on this ranch I hope
you itchy clits who are sneaking
down to the lake every night are
taking precautions Its bad enough
weve got cranes coming we dont
need storks I feel that those film
makers should be removed from the
Rubber Rose as soon as possible Men
can cause nothing but trouble here
I also feel that our guest

(she nods at Sissy)

should be excused while we discuss
this matter further

Hurt Sissy leaves the group
EXT RANCH DAY

Views of Sissy in her Whooping crane outfit dancing to

Debussy

in front of the Disney film crew The documentary being

directed by an effusive Frenchman

View of the camera crew training their long telephoto
lenses

on Siwash Lake They all seem to be wearing the same
trademark

satin baseball jackets with one logo or another on
their

backs

Another view of the lake from above from the Chinks

of view and our first view of THE CHINK The Chink
spies

Sissy and Jelly coming over a ridge

We cannot hear them at first but Sissy and Jelly are
talking

JELLY
see ee Delores zonks out on peyote at
least once a week but so far her
Third Vision hasnt happened
Niwetukame the Mother Goddess has
not gotten back in touch with her
Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling
each other like a couple of crosstown
high schools Tension Cowgirl
tension What a drag

SISSY
What is Debbies position

JELLY
Debbie says that if women are to
take charge again they must do it
in the feminine way they mustnt
resort to aggressive and violent
masculine methods She says it is up
to women to show themselves better
than men to love men set good
examples for them and guide them
tenderly toward the New Age Shes a
real dreamer that Debbie-dear

SISSY
You dont agree with Debbie then

JELLY
I wouldnt say that I expect shes
right ultimately But Im with
Delores when it comes to fighting
for whats mine I cant understand
why Delores is so uptight about the
Chink he could probably teach her a
thing or two Ee That grass tickles
doesnt it God knows I love women
but nothing can take the place of a
man that fits Still this is cowgirl
territory and Ill stand with Delores
and fight any bastards who might
deny it I guess Ive always been a
scrapper Look This scar Only twelve
years old and I was felled by a silver
bullet

Jelly takes Sissys hand carefully avoiding the thumbs
and

helps her feel the depression in her belly The
depression

is a dimple like another navel

AFTER A HUNGRY STILLNESS like intermission at a wolf
rhythms are established Jelly and Sissy are socked

another now and they arch and push and corkscrew and
jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence

Everything becomes scrambled They rock each other in
of sweat and saliva until we can see nothing

Noisy breaths buck out of Sissy Jelly Jelly but she
hear Sissy because she is screaming Hysterical from
scalding hot softness of girl-love

EXT HILLTOP DAY

The Chink looks on from the hilltop above

EXT FIELD DAY

Sissy and Jelly are riding on the back of a horse

A WHOOPING CRANE is spied by Sissy as she rides on the
of Jellybeans horse back to the ranch Delores and Big
hurry to meet them

DELORES

Sure enough across the yard in the midst of the low-
barbecue in progress monocle reflecting sunlight

holder stabbing the air stands the Countess

DELORES
Look at him Perverse as a pink
pickle

BIG RED

Sick as a vice squad

DELORES
Hes in a snit He wants to see you
right after the barbecue
Jellybean chuckles sardonically and dismounts
JELLY
Get the girls Hes gonna see me

right now

Sissy confused and loyalties torn in the face of an
impending revolution leaves the corral and

you actually suppose this exhibition
of childlike melodrama is advancing

Then take it

JELLY

assured puff

Sissy looks up to the quiet mountain Pauses Then she
back to the chaos below

THE CINEMATOGRAPHERS RENTED CONVERTIBLE AND THEIR
VAN drive away

Sissy sits and wonders The sun is setting on the
mixing well with the firelight that the Rubber Rose is
off

BUT SHE is aware of something watching her Looking
she sees nothing

VIEW of an empty trail

VIEW OF a quivering bush

Sissy turns to the sound of the CHINK

CHINK
Ha ha ho ho hee hee

AND THERE HE IS Standing only ten yards away

The Chinks problem is that he looks like he rolled out
Zen scroll as if he says presto a lot knows the

of lightning and the origin of dreams He LOOKS as if
drinks dew and fucks snakes

Sissy and the Chink scrutinize one another with mutual
fascination

CHINK
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee

Sissy is just about to speak but before she does THE
whirls and scampers up the mountainside

SISSY
Wait

Warily he stops and turns poised to flee again
Sissy smiles

SHE RAISES her ripe right thumb And jerking it and

swooshing
it she hitchhikes the Chink and his mountain
THERE HE STANDS where Sissys thumbs have stopped him
The
Chink wears the wary look of a wild animal Hes not
going
to stay stopped long It is Sissys move
SISSY
Well arent you going to shake your
whanger at me
The Chink pauses for a moment then he slaps his thighs
and

giggles hysterically Ha has ho hos and hee hees

of his nose and through the gaps in his teeth

CHINK
(laughter dies a

Oh Well theres been some trouble

out of the way Its so dark now I
doubt if I could find my way back

HE puts a kettle of stew over the fire and begins to
yams
THE CHINKS FACE as the fire dances off it
A CAN OF CHUNG KING water chestnuts is opened
CUT TO Sissy and the Chink eating supper on a rough
bench
AND AS THEY FINISH the Chink goes into a cave and
with a tiny peppermint-stripped plastic transistor
switches it on and the silence is broken by The Happy
Polka
Still clutching the radio in one hand the Chink hops
the wheel of firelight and begins to dance
Sissy walks around the fire watching the old geezer

CHINK
Yip Yip Ha ha ho ho and hee hee

Arms swimming feet firecrackering he dances and

When the song ends the Chink puts the radio down as
news comes on

CHINK
Personally I prefer Stevie Wonder
but what the hell Those cowgirls
are always bitching because the only
radio station in the area plays
nothing but polkas but I say you
can dance to anything if you really
feel like dancing

The Chink dances a little to the news and then lifts

Sissy
by her shoulders and guides her onto his pock-marked
dance
floor
SISSY
But I dont know how to polka
CHINK
Neither do I ha ha ho ho hee hee
The radio strikes up the Lawrence Welk is a Hero of
the
Republic Polka and the Chink and Sissy dance arm in
arm
their shadows reel against the curves of the depression
in
the mountain
Night birds fly past with fluttering feathers A bat
flies

out of the cave

The Chink escorts Sissy to a dark side of the
depression and
sits her down upon a pile of soft stuff dried

wheatgrass
faded Indian blankets and old down pillows without
cases
SISSY
(thinking)
So this is how Jelly spends her visits
to the Chink
A twanging noise sounds from the bowels of the nearby
cave

SISSY
What was that

CHINK
Clockworks

SISSY
Clockworks

too

clockworks

The Chink pauses to decide whether he should talk any
then proceeds

CHINK
The Clockworks is one reason that I
am here on Siwash Ridge I accepted
the invitation to be initiated as a
shaman by an aged Siwash chief who
was the principle outside confederate
of the Clock People

SISSY
Siwash huh

CHINK
He was a degenerated warlock who
could turn urine into beer and the
honor that he extended me gave me
rights of occupancy in this sacred
cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge
I came to the Dakota hills to
construct a clockworks of my own

Sissy cradles her head in her arms but is startled by

louder noise from the clockworks The Chink is startled

Bonk sounds the cave and then it chimes poing
The Chink smiles at the noise coming from his

But unlike the clockworks of the
Clock People my ticks more accurately
echo the ticks of the universe

SISSY
The Clock People

INT CAVE NIGHT

The Chink leads Sissy into the cave where we see his
clockworks It is made of garbage can lids and old

and lard tins and car fenders all wired together with

wire A bat flies into it making a bong noise and the
contraption moves a little

CHINK
During the Second World War I busted
out of Tule Lake detention camp as
a Japanese-American I had been put
there and watched over I found refuge
with the Clock People who discovered
me in a snow bank near dead I had
been climbing across the Sierra Nevada
mountains

SISSY
Then if you are Japanese then why
are you called the Chink

CHINK

The Clock People mistook me for
Chinese And the name stuck In the
same way that all Indian tribes came
to be labeled Indians through the
ignorance of an Italian sailor with
a taste for oranges it is only
fitting that Indians misnamed me
The Clock People however are not a
tribe rather they are a gathering
of Indians from various tribes They
have lived together since 1906

INT THE GREAT BURROW

A gathering of the Clock People A woman is giving
birth
near the Giant timekeeping hourglass

CHINK
The pivotal function of the Clock
People is the keeping and observing
of the clockworks It is a real thing
and is kept at the center at the
soul of the Great Burrow Insofar
as it is possible all Clock People
deaths and births occur in the
presence of the clockworks Aside
from birthing or dying the reason
for the daily visits to the clockworks
is to check the time

INT SIWASH CAVE NIGHT

Sissy listens to the Chink as they walk around the
Chinks
clockworks

CHINK
These people have no other ritual
than this one Likewise they have
but one legend or cultural myth
that of a continuum they call the
Eternity of Joy It is into the
Eternity of Joy that they believe
all men will pass once the clockworks
is destroyed The destruction must
come from the outside must come by
natural means must come at the will
of this gesticulating planet whose
more acute stirrings thoughtless
people call earthquakes

The Chink holds Sissys thumbs in his hands adoringly

CHINK
The Earth is alive She burns inside
with the heat of cosmic longing She
longs to be with her husband again
She moans She turns softly in her
sleep In the Eternity of Joy
pluralized deurbanized man at ease
with his gentle technologies will
smile and sigh when the Earth begins
to shake I loved those loony
redskins but I couldnt be a party
to their utopian dreaming After a
while it occurred to me that the
Clock People waiting for the Eternity
of Joy was virtually identical to
the Christians waiting for the Second
Coming Or the Communists waiting
for the worldwide revolution Or the
Debbies waiting for the flying
saucers All the same Just more
suckers betting their share of the
present on the future banking every
misery on a happy ending to history
Well history is ending every second -
happily for some of us unhappily
for others happily one second
unhappily the next History is always
ending and always not ending ha

Then he says nothing And his silence makes Sissy weep
sit down on a grass floor illuminated by the fire
the cave
Then the Chink without hesitation grasps her thumbs
squeezes them caresses them covers them with wet
telling them how beautiful they are
Sissy is bowled over frightened stunned elated
almost to tears
Sissy bends her head back and whispers
SISSY

If this be adultery make the most

of it
And as the Chink plunges into Sissy she arches her

bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him

Their bodies glowing in the firelight they cast

humanizing device The marmoset and

are absent or reduced to a tiny
tubercle the thumbs of the potto

eighty degrees to the other digits

Looks like every time we get together
things are in a mess

SISSY
So be it It looks serious this time
though All these guns are you

actually prepared to kill and die
for whooping cranes

JELLY
Hell no the cranes are wonderful
okay but Im not in this for whooping
cranes Im in it for cowgirls If
we cowgirls give in to authority on
this crane issue then cowgirls become
just another compromise I want a
finer fate than that -- for me and
for every other cowgirl Better no
cowgirls at all than cowgirls
compromised

SISSY
How did this business get started
anyhow Why are the birds nesting
here

DEBBIE
You were aware that we were feeding
them werent you We fed them brown
rice and they stayed over a couple
of extra days Then we decided to
try something different We mixed
our brown rice with fishmeal --
whoopers love seafood and fishmeal
is cheap Then Delores suggested
another ingredient and we think
thats what did the trick

SISSY
You mean
DEBBIE AND JELLY TOGETHER
PEYOTE

SISSY
Theyre drugged

JELLY
Aw come off it Sissy What do you
mean drugged Every living thing
is a chemical composition and anything
that is added to it changes that
composition When you eat a
cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers
bar it changes your body chemistry
The kind of food you eat the kind
of air you breathe can change your
mental state Does that mean youre
drugged

Sissy frames the flock with the hole in the center of
her
cheese sandwich

SISSY
No I guess not

JELLY
Drugged is a stupid word

SISSY

But the peyote is obviously affecting
their brains Its made them break a
migratory pattern that goes back
thousands of years

DEBBIE

The way I see it is that the peyote
mellowed them out Made them less
uptight They were afraid of bad
weather and humans Thats why they
migrated and kept to themselves But
the peyote has enlightened them
Its taught them there is nothing to
fear but fear itself Now theyre
digging life and letting the bad
vibes slide on Dont worry be happy
Be here now

SISSY
Fear in wild animals is completely
different from paranoia in people
In the wilderness ecosystem fear is
natural and necessary Its merely a
mechanism for maintaining life If
the cranes hadnt had a capacity for
fear they would have disappeared
long ago and youd be having to get
loaded with common old everyday
meadowlarks and mallards

JELLY
This here discussion is destined to
become academic Because weve got
less than half a bag of peyote buttons
left and Deloress run ended up in
the Mottburg jail So any day now
well get a chance to see how the
whoopers behave when they come down
to see if the peyote experience really
changed them or not But in the

EXT PRAIRIE NIGHT
Sissy and Jelly lie under the same stars under the

same
blankets Under the same spell
JELLY
Every time I tell you that I love
you you flinch But thats your
problem

SISSY
If I flinch when you say you love

confusion becomes your confusion
Students confuse teachers patients
confuse psychiatrists lovers with
confused hearts confuse lovers with
clear hearts

EXT CAMPFIRE NIGHT

Delores and some of the other cowgirls are talking A

EXT SIWASH LAKE DAY

Delores del Ruby appears from the reeds at Siwash

Lakes

edge asleep yet awake She has sunk so deep into the
hole

in her mind that gale and dust could not follow her

AS SHE APPROACHES THE COWGIRL CAMP THEY GATHER AROUND
HER

IN A TIGHT CIRCLE
MANY ARE TRANSFIXED as they listen

DELORES
It is womans mission to destroy as
well as to give birth We will destroy
the tyranny of the dull But we cant
destroy it with guns Or whips
Violence is the dullards Breakfast
of Champions and the logical end
product of his or her misplaced pride
Violence fertilizes that which we
would starve No we will destroy
the enemy in other ways The Peyote
Mother has promised a Fourth Vision
But it wont come to me alone It
will come to each of you to every
cowgirl in the land when you have
overcome that in your own self which
is dull The Fourth Vision will come
to some men too You will recognize
them when you meet them and be their
steady sidekicks in equal and ecstatic

its

walks

anticipation

escapades of poetic behavior and
romance

Delores holds up a card The prairie moon illuminates
tattered edges It is the jack of hearts

The forewoman seems to be tiring Fumes of weariness

from her black hair Her voice is leaning against the
of her larynx when she says

DELORES
First thing you must end this
business with the government and the
cranes Its been positive and
fruitful but its gone far enough
Playfulness ceases to serve a serious
purpose when it takes itself too
seriously Sorry I wont be with you
at the conclusion As you know Ive
been sick and stupid for a long time
I have a lot to make up for a lot
to accomplish and theres someone
important that Ive got to see Now

As graceful as a ballet for cobras Delores turns and
away into the night

THROUGH the scope of an FBI rifle Jelly is drawing her

out of her holster

EXT COWGIRL CAMP DAY
A VOICE OVER THE BULLHORN directed at the cowgirls
VOICE

Youve got two minutes to come out

with you hands over your heads
RANDOM G-MEN are sniping at the cowgirls making it
to surrender
A stray bullet SENDS THE CHINK back down the hillside
robe and sandals flying
IN THE HUSH that follows in the echoes of the
fire the whooping crane flock rises in one grand
beating feathers - a lily white storm of life a gush
albino Gabriels -- swarm into the waiting sky and
the pond one time before flapping south toward Texas
they cast shadows over a dead Jellybean who is
biting the dust
Sissy lifts Jelly out of the dust and holds her Sissy
Jellys satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband

skirt Bright red blood is running out of her scar
JELLY
Right in the scar where I fell ona

An undertaker pounding five nails into a white coffin

ON

THE TOP OF THE COFFIN are engraved two crossed GOLD
SIXGUNS

There are eleven famous cowgirls enameled on the edges
and

in the middle it reads
BONANZA JELLYBEAN
1944-1973
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee
Title card
The brown paper bag
A brown paper bag is sitting on the side of the road
A VOICE
The brown paper bag is the only thing
civilized man has produced that does
not seem out of place in nature
Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles

like the fossilized brain of a dryad
its kinship to tree (to knot and
nest) unobscured by the cruel crush
of industry absorbing the elements
like any other organic entity
blending with rock and vegetation as
if it were a burrowing owls door
mat or a jack rabbits underwear a
No 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded
in the hills of Dakota and appeared
to live where it lay Once long ago
it had borne a package of buns anda
jar of mustard to a kitchenette
rendezvous with a fried hamburger
More recently the bag had
held love letters

View of a bunkhouse trunk

VOICE
As a hole in an oak hides a squirrels
family jewels the bag had hidden
love letters in the bottom of a
bunkhouse trunk

Hands lift the contents of the trunk away rope spurs
and
blanket and find the hidden sack of letters

VOICE
Then one day after work the button-
nosed little cowgirl to whom the
letters were addressed gathered bag
and contents under her arm slipped
out to the corral

We see the Cowgirl saddling her horse late in the day

VOICE
past ranch hands pitching
horseshoes and ranch hands flying
Tibetan kites saddled up and trotted
into the hills

We see the Cowgirl riding along a ridge

VOICE
A mile or so from the bunkhouse she
dismounted and built a small fire
she fed the fire letters

And this we see also the lonely Cowgirl feeding the
letters
to a fire in the dusky early night We can see the
cowgirl
is Sissy Hankshaw

VOICE
one by one the way her girl friend
had once fed her french fries

She is crying now and feeding the fire close of words
like
always and forever burning up

VOICE
As words such as sweetheart and
honey britches and forever and
always burned away the cowgirl
squirted a few tears Her eyes were
so misty she forgot to burn the bag

INT BUNKHOUSE NIGHT
Sissy is sobbing

Big Red offers a piece of homemade fudge and shows no
surprise
when Sissy refuses it

Kym kisses the lips quickly of the despondent Cowgirl
and
the bunkhouse lights go out

Delores plunks a carefree song on an old Gibson looks
up at
the moon

DELORES
You know podner you can tune a
guitar but you cant tuna fish

She plunks a few notes

DELORES
God but its good to be a cowgirl

And the bunkhouse lights are turned off There are some
giggles from the cowgirls

INT MAIN BEDROOM RANCH DAY
THE CHINK wakes up and is being cared for by Sissy He

is in
pain but winking
SISSY
Is everything getting worse

CHINK
Yes everything is getting worse
But everything is also getting better

SISSY
The Countess has come to our aid
The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially
deeded to all the cowgirls And I
have been asked to oversee the ranch
For 300 a week And as it turns
out the Countess is not going to be
the vegetable the doctors thought he
was heres a picture

Sissy shows a picture of the Countess recovering in a
hospital
bed posing next to Doctor Robbins

CHINK
I want to go back to the Clock People
I kind of miss those fool redskins
and wonder what theyre up to Whats
happened to Jelly

SISSY
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas
City

CHINK
You mean shes dead

The Chink mourns a bit

SISSY
But thats an old story now I
cant believe that you would leave
the Butte

CHINK
Easy come easy go

DELORES
Wow you sure have a way with words

The Chink looks over and sees that Delores is standing
in
the doorway
CHINK
I cant help it if I grew up in an
antipoetic culture Language will be
different when Im with the Clock
People though Theyre from an oral
tradition And Im not talking about
what you horny hop toads do in bed
every night

The Chink smiles
Delores blushes

SISSY
Well if the Clock People give you
any inside information on the end of
the world drop us a postcard

CHINK

The world isnt going to end you
dummy I hope you know that much

(he grows

uncharacteristically

serious)
But it is going to change Its going
to change drastically and probably
in your lifetime The Clock People
see calamitous earthquakes as the
agent of change and they may be
right since there are a hundred
thousand earthquakes a year and major
ones are long overdue But there are
far worse catastrophes coming
unless the human race can bring itself
to abandon the goals and values of
civilization in other words unless
it can break the consumption habit --
and we are so conditioned to consuming
as a way of life that for most of us
life would have no meaning without
the yearnings and rewards of
progressive consumption It isnt
merely that our bad habits will cause
global catastrophes but that our
operative political-economic
philosophies have us in such a blind
crab grip that they prevent us from
preparing for the natural disasters
that are not our fault So the
apocalyptic shit is going to hit the
fan all right but therell be some
of us itll miss Little pockets of

He begins
smiling

humanity Like the Clock People

Like you two honeys if you decide

to accept my offer of a lease on
Siwash Cave Theres almost no
worldwide calamity -- famine nuclear
accident plague weather warfare or
reduction of the ozone shield --

that you couldnt survive in that
cave

to caress Sissys belly His eyes are

Sissy is surprised

The Chink

CHINK
Suppose that you bear five or six
children with your characteristics
All in Siwash Cave Ina
postcatastrophe world your offspring
would of necessity intermarry forming
in time a tribe A tribe every member
of which had giant thumbs A tribe
of Big Thumbs would relate to the
environment in very special ways It
could not use weapons or produce
sophisticated tools It would have
to rely on its wits and its senses
It would have to live with animals --
and plants -- as virtual equals
Its extremely pleasant to me to
think about a tribe of physical
eccentrics living peacefully with
animals and plants learning their
languages perhaps and paying them
the respect they deserve

SISSY
How am I going to be the progenitor
of a tribe when Im living on an
isolated ridgetop with Delores

CHINK
Thats your problem

coughs

CHINK
Listen to the way Im babbling That
bullet must have loosened one of my
transistors Dont pay any attention
to me Youve got to work it out for
yourself The westbound choo-choo
leaves Mottburg at one-forty I want
to be on it Will you drive me to
the station

INT TRUCK DAY

Sissy and Delores are driving the Chink out the front
gate
of the Rubber Rose

CHINK
Schedules Ironic how I have to follow
timetables in order to get back to
the clockworks

He yells out the window of the moving vehicle

CHINK
Dont ever bet against paradox
ladies

EXT THE RUBBER ROSE GATES

We hear the Chink yelling and the Rubber Rose sign is
being
changed to one that reads El Rancho Jellybean

CHINK
if complexity doesnt beat you
then paradox will Ha ha ho ho and

And the truck disappears into the prairie land

A LONG DARK PAUSE UNTIL finally we are inside the cave
where
the Chinks Clockworks are at work poing

It is revealed that Sissy is with Delores snug in the
old

hermits living quarters She listens to the clinking
of the

Chinks Clockworks

And feels her belly

The swell of her belly has forced her to sleep on her
back

CLOSE VIEW of Sissys belly and a little foot kicks
from
inside Or is it a foot
VIEW INSIDE THE BELLY of Sissys unborn baby It is
half-
Japanese one thirty-second Siwash and all thumbs

The moving thumbs are hitchhiking you

THE END
