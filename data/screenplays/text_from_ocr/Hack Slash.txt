FADE IN

EXT MIDWEST WILDERNESS - NIGHT

SHADOWS

Bouncing in the moonlight Threatening forboding until-
70’S ROCK

Fills the soundtrack and the shadows melt into
REFLECTIONS of young bodies lounging around calm water on
a humid summer night

WIDER TO REVEAL

A keg party in the middle of the woods GMC trucks
campfires and a beautiful view of a FRESH WATER LAKE
stretching as far as the eye can see

Ordinary kids doing what ordinary kids do best Some
tell stories some make out some chug beers

TRACKING WITH A BLONDE

As she rises up from the campfire and pulls off her top
to reveal a glistening hot body underneath After some
coaxing she runs onto the dock and-

CANNONBALLS into the water

Everyone cheers Then other kids strip down to shorts
and join her in the warm water

All but one

a GIRL on a bench in t-shirt and cargo pants
watching them like it’s an alien mating ritual This is-

CASSIE HACK Her hair in an asymmetrical cyber-punk cut dyed jet-
black Beautiful if only she’d let it show

She observes the hot blonde seductively luring a JOCK
into the woods for some alone time

CASSIE
(rolling her eyes)
Keep working it slut

CUTE BOY (0C)
Let me guess You’re not a
swimmer

She looks over to see a CUTE BOY approaching
CASSIE
Don’t tell me you’re about to sell
me on a rufeed drink

CUTE BOY
That’s not how I work

CASSIE
Wow Your game’s that good

The boy gently reaches out and takes her hand He’s too
cute to resist

CUTE BOY
Come on Live a little

Cassie stares into his eyes and knows she can’t say no
She casts a nervous glance towards the woods then rises
and walks with him towards the lake On the way she
removes her blouse revealing a GORGEOUS BODY beneath
CASSIE
For the record this isn’t what I
do every Friday night

CUTE BOY
Trust me it’s obvious

Together they jump into the water
The teens laugh and play around as the rock music SWELLS

Cassie tries to enjoy herself amidst the fun but she
gets knocked backwards by an errant elbow only to be-

CAUGHT

By the cute boy who takes her by the chin about to
bring her in for a romantic kiss when suddenly-

A SCREAM

Echoes out through the woods

Everyone stops For a moment not sure if what they heard
was what it sounded like Then another FEMALE SCREAM

this one more urgent

TEENAGE BOY 1
Where’s Jenny

TEENAGE GIRL 1
She went off just a second ago-

Before anyone can react Cassie’s already out of there
sprinting into the woods like she’s on a mission The
group follows

They push through the endless evergreen branches
following the screams until they finally come to the hot
blonde aka JENNY topless and on her knees holding
the hand of the jock as his eyes go BLANK

CUTE BOY
What happened

Cassie looks down and that’s when she sees-

SHE IS STANDING ON THE BOY’S LOWER HALF A full ten feet
away He’s been sliced in two

CASSIE
Weve got to leave now

TEENAGE GIRL 1
Is he dead

And then suddenly-
A FLYING AXE

Hits the girl’s back its momentum so powerful that it
throws her into a tree pinning her there

Everyone splits in ten thousand different directions as-
A LOOMING FIGURE comes at them through the woods

A hulking terrifying SLASHER In the moonlight we can
see his face is horribly disfigured melted by first

degree burns his jaw dislocated several times over

He rips the axe out of the girl’s back as he walks by
She drops to the ground her eyes dead white

ON CASSIE sprinting in bare feet looking over her
shoulder frantically

ON THE OTHER TEENS screaming crying to themselves
running lost through the dark woods

Cassie hears BRANCHES CRACKING under the feet of the

lurking slasher behind her He’s getting closer She
makes a hard right just as-

SHE RUNS INTO THE CUTE BOY
Both of them hit the ground out of breath

CUTE BOY
Are you okay

Before Cassie can answer a HAND comes down and picks him
up tossing him sideways into a tree The boy tries to
get up but the slasher-

BRINGS DOWN THE AXE

Causing Cassie to look away in horror as fresh blood
sprays all over her half-naked body She pulls herself
to her feet and runs away

The slasher discards the boy and goes after her -
Cassie runs wildly eventually stumbling across-

A LOG CABIN

In a clearing Lights off Abandoned

Out of breath she runs for it and disappears inside
The slasher sees her go in

INT LOG CABIN - NIGHT

He runs in after her ready for a feast when-

THE DOOR SLAMS BEHIND HIM

The slasher looks back to see SEVERAL IRON LATCHES
slamming down in succession over the door frame rigged
by some kind of homemade contraption And more amazing
yet

the room is filled with HACK-ASSEMBLED WEAPONS

Crossbows cleavers anything you could buy at a pawn
shop to kill a slasher it’s all here

Cassie stands in the center holding-
A BASEBALL BAT

With the words “KISS IT” burned into the side Nails and
barbed wire protrude from the top

CASSIE
You just made the biggest mistake
of your un-dead life

The slasher tilts his head a brief moment of “what the
fuck” just as-

A LARGE SLINGSHOT CONTRAPTION

Launches a HAIL OF KITCHEN KNIVES straight towards him
They plunge into his thick flesh and throw him backwards
into a wall

The slasher recovers but Cassie comes at him with her
baseball bat and-

AN ALL-OUT FIGHT ENSUES

Cassie uses speed and smarts to out-think the powerful
but lumbering man coming at her She’s definitely not
the innocent girl we saw on the beach but she’s not
quite the hardened warrior either A mix of anger and
vulnerability

She dives around him jumping off a wall and knocking him
with her bat just as she slides sideways along the
ground rolling into a table where she grabs-

A CROSSBOW
Which she points and FIRES
TRACKING

With the arrow as it DIVES THROUGH the slasher’s chest
and lodges in the wall on the other side He tries to
come at her when he notices-

A CORD

Running through the arrow (and now his chest) connected
to Cassie’s hand on the other side She pulls at it
causing him to drop to his knees and then anchors it to
a broken fridge on the other side of the room

The slasher rises back to his feet coming towards her in
a straight line as the cord runs through him

CASSIE (CONT’D)
That’s right Walk the line

He’s about to grab her when he HITS A BARB in the cord
causing him to momentarily stop Their faces are inches
apart

Cassie smiles and points upwards That’s when the
slasher looks up and sees-

AN INVERTED BEAR TRAP

Dangling from the ceiling which suddenly CLAMPS DOWN on
top of his head as we-

CUT TO

BAT LOG CABIN - NIGHT

The surviving teenagers gathering together outside the
log cabin

PAINED SCREAMS

Echo from inside Except these aren’t a girl’s screams
These are coming from the slasher himself

They reach a powerful crescendo and then suddenly STOP
Moments later the door slams open and out walks Cassie
still in her cargo pants and a bra caked in blood with
a duffel bag over her shoulder

She stares blankly at the confused teenagers none of
whom know what the hell is going on

POLICE SIRENS
Rise in the distance And then-
A BEAT-UP SHIPPING VAN

Pulls up to a stop behind them Blue dented A sticker
on the rear window “Caution Live Animals Inside”

The side door slides open Cassie heads towards it
dropping at the feet of the teenagers-

THE SLASHER’S HEAD

One of the girls soaking wet her breasts practically
showing through her wet t-shirt steps forward

TEENAGE GIRL 2
Wait Who are you

CASSIE

Just another scared slut who
Sshould’ve kept her clothes on

And with that she jumps into the van as it DRIVES OFF

lockers all closed except for one

A BODY BAG

Lies on the floor a few feet away Headless It’s the
Slasher from earlier that night

VLAD
Some Slashers are different Some
take longer some take shorter

CASSIE
None of these honeys have ever
taken longer than three hours to
bounce back and you know it
Maybe he wasn’t a Slasher after
all

Vlad checks his digital watch which is COUNTING DOWN

VLAD
Fourteen seconds left

CASSIE
Your watch isn’t accurate
Mickey’s always on the dime-

Suddenly-

THE BODY BAG LIFTS UP

And the leather fabric tears open to reveal a HEADLESS
SLASHER thrashing about his powerful arms reaching for
anything within sight

Vlad takes the machete rises and-

SLICES

The body several times causing more blood to spray as
the slasher spins limply into the wall It tries again
to rise with renewed life but this time Vlad takes it

out with authority A few extra hits for good measure

internet search

killings Some on myths and legends some police
blotters some serial killer fan sites Cassie takes it
in like this is business as usual

up his filtration mask and places it over his mouth

Then after a beat of making sure he’s asleep she
Switches over to a bookmarked site

FACEBOOK

She logs in and scans through various pictures of young
faces People from her past All linked to one group

“CHIPPEWA FALLS CLASS OF 2010”
Cassie absorbs each image of teenagers enjoying
themselves There’s a sadness in her eyes Not quite

nostalgia More like regret

Finally she comes to her own face One year younger
Glasses Straight brown hair Not smiling one bit

Cassie tries to help Patrick up Then she catches sight
of a DARK FIGURE just inside her line of vision
standing in the alley blocking their exit

Obscured in darkness A carving knife in her left hand
dripping with blood

Cassie screams out and crawls away Her mother looms
with the hulking presence of a demon her body hidden
entirely by shadows

Her mother takes a step closer when suddenly-
PATRICK JUMPS OUT

Knocking himself into the Lunch Lady and causing her to
fall backwards the carving knife clattering to the
floor They roll over on the wet tiled floor together
struggling for dominance

The Lunch Lady has all the strength grabbing Patrick by
the throat and shoving his face into the mirrored wall-

SHATTERING IT VIOLENTLY

The Lunch Lady picks up one of the splintered glass
fragments and raises it in the air about to slice it
across Patrick’s throat when-

THE CARVING KNIFE PLUNGES INTO HER BACK

The Lunch Lady furiously whirls around Cassie raises a

locker door and SLAMS IT into the blunt end of the knife
pushing it further into her heart Her mother falls back
against the wall shuddering in shadows

Patrick sits up and watches as her legs stop gyrating
Then he looks towards Cassie-

HUDDLED IN THE CORNER

Hugging her knees to her chest hysterical not knowing

slasher

EXT DETROIT ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Cassie emerges over the parapet just in time to see Razor
leaping athletically onto an adjacent rooftop

She grabs an antenna and TEARS IT OFF its mount pulling
away the multiple prongs to use it as a weapon Then she
pursues Razor across the roof-

JUMPING

And barely clearing the gap between the buildings She
does a quick roll across the slick asphalt roof

No sign of Razor But Cassie can sense he’s not far

She creeps around the multiple chimneys and obstructions
ducking under a clothesline keeping her eyes on all
Sides as she tries to listen for sounds of the slasher

SHADOWS

Of antennae and different buildings loom on her back as
she slides sideways That’s when she notices that-

ONE OF THE SHADOWS IS MOVING

She ducks sideways just as Razor leaps down from a
landing overhead his blades wielded She manages to
avoid most of his attack but he still-

SLICES HER

Brutally across the shoulder as she lands Cassie rears

back and swings with her antenna cutting his face
Blood pours down Razor’s cheek He only smiles

He feels no pain

Cassie looks down at her bleeding shoulder She’s only
got one side to attack with

Razor comes back in again but she ducks backwards
propping her legs up and kicking him away He bounces
off the wall and recoils quickly

Cassie thinks fast seeing a cluster of ELECTRICAL WIRES
wrapped nearby which she picks up tearing at the base
exposing the crackling copper end to the rain and then-

JAMMING IT INTO RAZOR

The shock throws him around wildly his entire body
coursing with electricity as he hits each surface like a
convulsing animal Finally he goes sliding down a wet
incline and stops on the edge of the roof

He tries to sit up but Cassie is already on top of him
He brings one of his hands towards her but she quickly
grabs it and-

SHOVES THE BLADES AGAINST HIS THROAT

She holds him there hostage by his own weapon

CASSIE
(filled with rage)
Who are you

Razor only responds by sticking out his shredded
tongue

- AND THEN BITING IT OFF

Blood pours from his mouth He’s not saying anything
Cassie backs off in horror giving Razor time to right
himself and PICK HER UP holding her between his lanky
arms and then-

THROWING HER OFF THE LANDING

She slides down the slanted roof and lands with a thud on
the next landing fifteen feet below

She rolls over on the asphalt injured badly her
shoulder wound bleeding profusely when Razor emerges
above her

Cassie has no weapons No more energy to fight Her
Vision is blurring in and out of focus

Razor picks up her chin with one of his barbed fingers

Vlad steps backwards suddenly sensing-
A PRESENCE

He reaches to his belt and grips his machete Then he
spins and swings his machete slicing a CAT in half

Cassie kneels looks at its tags

Coincidence

Cassie glances over towards Darren’s dresser on which
she sees a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH

somber here

with Patrick

KYLE

end to last year once and for all

Patrick looks to Lucy puts his hand on hers

PATRICK
What do you think Lucy

LUCY
Maybe we shouldn’t do it at her
actual house

KYLE
That’s part of the charm

PATRICK
Kyle give it a rest-

KYLE
Canceling this party 1s exactly

Kyle leans towards them speaking with grim conviction

Holy shit

He gets up to confront her

KYLE
What the hell are you doing nere

Everyone at the drive-in stops to observe Cassies
arrival She can feel a hundred eyes staring straight

Patrick grabs Kyle just as ihe gets inches from Cassie’s
unflinching face

PATRICK
Leave her alone

CASSIE
I didn’t come for a fight

KYLE
Well you sure brought the body
count with you-

Patrick shoves Kyle away

PATRICK
Kyle Give it a rest

Kyle glares at him

KYLE
Right I forgot about how you were
always soft on her

PATRICK
Just because I’m not an asshole
doesn’t mean I’m taking her side

KYLE

Yeah Don’t forget whose side
you’re on Patrick

Kyle storms away taking Lucy with him as he goes She
gives Cassie a dirty look over her shoulder

Patrick waits until they are alone then tu

ms to face

Cassie There’s anger in his eyes - an anger that stems
from fear - but he’s trying to move past it

PATRICK
What do you want

CASSIE
Look I kKnow I’m the last person
anyone wants to see But I can
help

Patrick just waits for it

CASSIE (CONT’D)
Someone’s going after the
survivors of the Lunch Lady
massacre They’re finishing the
job my mother couldn’t

PATRICK
One death doesn’t make a killing
spree-

CASSIE

Megan’s dead too

Patrick stops Registers Shakes his head in disbelief

PATRICK
Then we should go to the cops

CASSIE
They’re not going to protect you
from this

PATRICK
Why not

CASSIE
You can’t arrest these people

You have to kill them Sometimes

more than once

Patrick glances back towards his friends
bereaved girlfriend

CASSIE (CONT’D)

To Lucy His

Patrick I know what she means to

you I can protect you-

PATRICK
No I don’t know what you’ve seen

VLAD
Cassie-

CASSIE

Just shut up and drive Vlad
Okay Can you do that

Vlad gets into the driver’s seat Cassie climbs in next
to him watching behind her as Patrick consoles Lucy in
the distance

Vlad starts the ignition and they peel off

INT CASSIE’S VAN - LATER

Cassie stares straight ahead her eyes swollen Vlad
glances at her sideways not knowing what to say

CASSIE
It was pointless to come here

Cassie looks down at her lap where she’s holding an old
PHOTO ALBUM -Pictures of herself and Megan during
happier times

CASSIE (CONT’D)
Megan was the only person worth
Saving Everyone else can go to
hell

VLAD
Everyone is worth saving

CASSIE
What do you know You grew up in
a basement remember

She angrily tosses the photo album into the back
Vlad finally speaks what’s on his mind

VLAD

I do not like that we meet these
people and then they die When I
lived in the basement I knew only
one person the butcher One day
he died and it was very sad But
after that I knew no one else So
at least I was not hurt again

(pauses)
Then I met you You were the only
one who didn’t hate me because of
my looks And we became friends

CASSIE
Vlad I thought you were a
slasher I tried to kill you

VLAD
Misunderstanding All forgiven

Cassie sighs and leans on the door

VLAD (CONT’D)
Sometimes I think I will lose you
Like I lost the butcher And I
will be sad again
(pauses)
But then I think about not having
anyone And this is better

Vlad looks at her earnestly

TEARS begin to form in Cassie’s eyes She knows he’s
right but she’s got a lifetime of pain to answer to

CASSIE
Vlad Promise me something If I
die if I lose it and go over the
edge someday don’t let me come
back like those things

Vlad looks at her seriously

VLAD
If that happens I will take you
down myself I promise

She reaches out and squeezes his hand

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Lucy drives cautiously through the windy back-roads
leading to the town’s residential area

She pulls out a cigarette and fumbles for the lighter
As she sits back up she suddenly sees straight ahead-

A BODY
In the road We’re not sure what or how but Lucy’s
instincts kick in and she immediately pumps the breaks

and swerves the SUV violently

It fishtails across the road and BROAD-SIDES a thick oak
tree on the passenger side

Lucy shaken in tears but not injured stumbles out of
the car and limps around to the road where she sees-

A DEAD DEER
Lying there Not exactly the body we were suspecting

LUCY
Jesus Christ

She starts to turn back for her car when she notices
something about this animal

ITS BODY HAS BEEN SLASHED UP
Violently bloody with many small razors We recognize
the MO immediately Of course Lucy doesn’t and she

creeps closer towards the carcass just as-

Suddenly blare into view An oncoming pickup truck
rushing at 70 miles per hour It HONKS at her loudly

Lucy dives out of the way as the truck sails by blasting
country music out of the side of its cab She raises her
arms and screams after it

LUCY (CONT’D)
Fucking townies

She’s about to cross the street again when suddenly-
ARMS REACH AROUND

And grab her from the darkness Lucy screams and
thrashes at the attacker pushing him away as she falls
on her back in the middle of the pavement

Emerging from the woods is RAZOR himself His hands
extended the razor blades showing

Lucy stares in horror at his awful appearance

LUCY (CONT’D)
What the hell are you

Razor slices at her body taking away shards of blood and
clothing as Lucy backs up against her SUV kicking and
screaming

She manages to prop up her feet and push him away then
crawls over the hood of the car and lies there crying
panting trying to catch her breath Suddenly-

TWO HANDS

Grab her by the hair from overhead and drag her back over
the hood landing with a thud on the ground Lucy tries
to struggle against him but he smacks her face into the
side of the car momentarily dazing her

Lucy lies on the ground as Razor walks around to the back
seat of the car and pulls out-

A SPARE GASOLINE TANK He takes the spout end of the
tank and-

JAMS IT INTO HER MOUTH
Razor holds her in place with uncanny strength staring

into her eyes as she flails about helplessly Gasoline
pours down her throat

Finally he withdraws the spout and tosses it off into the
woods Lucy bends over on her hands and knees and-

VOMITS GAS AND BLOOD

Splashing the pavement She slicks her chin and chest
with flammable liquid Dizzy Puking repeatedly

Razor stands back as she tries to crawl away leaving a
wet trail behind her

Then he calmly walks around to the driver’s side door
reaching inside and finding on the floor of the front
seat

HER CAR LIGHTER

He walks it back around again Stops where Lucy first
vomited She sees what he’s doing

LUCY (CONT’D)
No-

But he only smiles hideously flickering the lighter and
dropping it to the pavement as-

WHOOSH
The gas ignites Flames race up the long line of vomited

gas There’s nothing Lucy can do as the fire leaps up
her chest and-

DISAPPEARS INTO HER MOUTH

Now something truly awful happens Her stomach starts
GLOWING ORANGE Like ET And then it starts to bubble
And cave in

A hole has formed in her stomach exposing cooked
intestines growing larger as she’s burned from the
inside out Her melted eyes pool out of the sockets as

Kyle still sobering up comes striding towards her his
eyes wild with anger

propane flame hovering over it for warmth

relentless And nearly impossible
to bring down We’re still
working out all the rules

PATRICK
That’s what you’ve been doing for
the past year

VLAD
We’re slasher hunters

Kyle glances at Viad who still hides behind his hood and
mask

KYLE
Yeah and what are you exactly

Leave him out of this

Patrick rubs his eyes in disbelief

PATRICK
I can’t believe these things are
real

CASSIE

Believe it And they don’t stay
dead Stab ‘em shoot ‘em burn

PATRICK
Why

CASSIE
Revenge It’s usually linked to a
vendetta against a person family
group of friends Like the kind
of people who make fun of a lunch
lady’s daughter

Kyle looks at Cassie like she’s insane

Vlad nods slowly

KYLE

for you to swallow Patrick You
go on with your Honor Society
college-bound bullshit about right
and wrong and the kids who don’t
deserve to die but when you trim

the fat and get down to what this
is really about my mother was
just doing what anyone else would
have done

PATRICK
You don’t mean that

CASSIE
I do That’s the problem with
slashers sometimes they’ve got

the right idea

PATRICK
We’re all just kids We didn’t
know what we were doing-

CASSIE

Sure I’ve seen it a thousand
times A bunch of jocks tease the
unpopular girl until she falls out
a window Camp counselors go
drinking during free swim and some
kid drowns The prom queen runs
over a homeless guy and hides the
body before anyone can find out
But when the poor dead guy comes
back with an axe and a fucked up
sense of justice nobody seems to
know it was coming

Razor goes to the back of the store where a door is
labeled “SUPPLY CLOSET” He takes the handle and TWISTS

The clerk hears the noises but simply turns the page of
his comic and keeps reading

Moments later Razor emerges carrying-
A LARGE SLEDGEHAMMER

Onto the asphalt splintering it apart with each
powerful resounding blow digging it open until the rest
of the earth below-

What was once someone’s humble living room has now been
reduced to something resembling a crack house Graffiti
mars the walls A dirty mattress where daring teens must
have had sex

But now the area’s been lit and plays host to a keg
party Some teens are dangling their legs out the broken
windows while a few JOCKS

are rigging up a Molotov cocktail chain Small
bottles tied together via a soaked newspaper line
They’re getting ready to burn down the place

End of an era baby-

Cassie and Patrick walk through this taking note of what
they are doing Cassie just sighs

She goes towards a closet filled with toilet paper and
used condoms and discreetly stashes a few homemade
weapons from her backpack

PATRICK
You’re really gonna need all of
those

CASSIE

In this business you never know

They cross towards the main stairway Cassie sits on the
steps Listening to music outside

CASSIE (CONTD)
How are you holding up Patrick

PATRICK
Just trying to keep the plan
straight -

CASSIE

That’s not what I’m talking about

Patrick glances at her Understands

PATRICK
I miss her Thinking of her being
alone when she died it’s my
fault
CASSIE
If you’d been there you’d be dead
too
PATRICK

But maybe she wouldn’t
Cassie bites her lip thinking for a beat

CASSIE
I remember when we were younger
We used to be friends You were
different before you met her
Remember that

There’s no one you’ve ever felt
that way about Nobody you just
hit a connection with one time

She leans forward and tenderly KISSES THE OTHER GIRL ON

Ricky smiles and begins rolling as the girls begin to
make out dropping back on the bed

RICKY
Far out

He stands back towards the doorway to get a wider angle
when we notice-

A LOOMING FIGURE

Obscured in darkness standing behind his line of vision
blocking out all light

RICKY (CONT’D)
Come on man I’m trying to get
focus here-
He turns to see the dark figure just as we CUT AWAY and-

batteries into a chainsaw

KYLE
Sounds like a bad ass party

VLAD
Hurrm

KYLE
Not something you want to check

VLAD

Have to stay here
KYLE
What are you afraid of crowds or
something
Vlad turns away keeping his silence
KYLE (CONT’D)
Yeah I guess if I looked that way
I’d be pretty much a shut-in too

Vlad keeps working on his chainsaw We stay framed on
him sitting in front of the windshield just as-

RAZOR

Drops down into frame landing on top of the windshield
and-

SHATTERING IT

Into several pieces He reaches in and picks Vlad up
TOSSING HIM out into the street

KYLE (CONT’D)
Holy shit

Kyle pushes open the doors and jumps out the back of the
van just as-

EXT CHIPPEWA FALLS HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT

TWO HANDS

Grab him from behind spinning him around to see Razors
horrific face smiling at him in the moonlight

KYLE
What the hell are you

Razor raises his hand his blades glimmering in the
moonlight about to slice down when-

AN AXE

Slams into his back throwing him sideways as Kyle drops
to the ground

Razor cartwheels across the street the axe still lodged
in his back He can’t reach it to pull it out so
instead he simply SLAMS THE HANDLE onto the curb
knocking the blade out of his back and standing to face-
VLAD

Ready for a fight He looks down at Kyle

VLAD
This is between us

INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

One of the cute girls the one referred to as “Sam”
crawls out from the bedroom drenched in blood suffering
from severe knife lacerations all over her body
Something is chasing her Slowly and patiently

The girl reaches the top of the stairs trying to scream
for help but no one can hear her over the din of the
music

INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassie stands among the dancing bodies her eyes
surveilling nervously Waiting for something to happen

Her walkie-talkie SCREAMS OUT Kyle’s voice She covers
one ear to try to listen to it over the pounding music

CASSIE
Vlad Are you there
KYLE (0S)
(on walkie-talkie)
come he’s out

CASSIE
I can’t hear a word you’re saying
hold on

INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Sam looks down at her reveling friends so close yet so
far away She can’t get their attention

The attacker stands over her raising a HUGE MEAT CLEAVER
in the air and-

BRINGS IT DOWN

Stabbing the girl in the back again and again as blood
fills her screaming mouth She gets up with all of her
strength but then the last gasp runs out of her and she-
PALLS

Through the railing down the single story drop to the
bottom of the stairs in the foyer

Everyone below SCREAMS OUT at the sight of Sam’s body
splayed out gruesomely on her back

Kids start to sprint for the exits

except for two people standing still as bodies file
past them Cassie and Patrick

Cassie stares at Sam’s body and then turns her glare
upwards towards-

A DARK FIGURE
Moving out of the way at the top of the stairs

Cassie’s gaze focuses She knows exactly who this is
She opens up her backpack and pulls from it-

HER “KISS-IT” BAT

CASSIE
Get out of here

EXT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

The partying teens are beginning to flee outside when
they stop to see-

VLAD AND RAZOR FIGHTING

In the street near the front lawn Razor waves his
blades at Vlad’s face and neck but Vlad grabs him
picking him up into the air and-

SLAMMING HIM

Into the side of the van Razor lands on the ground a
Few feet away from where Kyle is lying He reaches for
him but Vlad grabs Razor’s legs swinging him sideways-
INTO ANOTHER CAR

The windows shatter The alarm goes off

Vlad comes over for more but this time Razor spins
around and-

DIGS HIS FINGERS INTO VLAD’S CHEST

Breaking the skin with his sharp razors and holding him
there pulling Vlad closer Vlad cringes in pain never
screaming out but instead reaching to his waist and
grabbing-

HIS MACHETE

Which he swings out and-

SLICES OFF RAZOR’S HAND

It lands and flops about a few feet away Razor holding

his forearm opens his mouth as if to emit a guttural
scream but no sound comes out

INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The music’s still pounding loudly but the revelers have
cleared out

Cassie carrying her bat timidly explores the empty
hallways stepping over the dead bodies of Ricky and the
two cute girls

INT CASSTIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cassie steps into the bedroom she grew up in The old
floorboards creak under her weight

Assortments of moth-ridden clothes in the closet Ratty
school books Stale colorless make-up Rusty stained
jewelry A life abandoned

ON THE WALL a photo of Cassie and her mother pre-
massacre

She takes a moment No sign of her mother anywhere until-
HEAVY STRAINED BREATHING

Sounds out behind her Cassie doesn’t turn She’s too
afraid Over her shoulder in the pale light of the
street lamps outside we can see a FIGURE in the corner

Cassie squeezes her bat raising it in the air and
spinning to see for the first time in full view-

DELILAH HACK THE LUNCH LADY

Or something that was once her Now she’s a rotting
hulking wraith Mouth twisted into rawboned rictus
Eyes hollowed out skin horribly burnt Body bloated
still wearing a blood-stained kitchen apron

DELILAH
(low moan)
My girl

Cassie drops at the horrifying sight She crawls
backwards as the figure slowly steps out of the
shadows

and the FLOOR GIVES OUT

Sending Cassie and her mother plunging down to the first
floor landing-

“INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

-on top of the counter and rolling to the ground

The two jocks whom we saw earlier are running through
They see Cassie lying there

JOCK 1

Cassie looks up just as the shadowed frame of her mother
rises behind the jock and-

DIGS A KITCHEN KNIFE INTO HIS BACK

So hard it thrusts out through his chest and lifts his
feet off the ground The jock’s eyes roll over The
Lunch Lady takes him by the neck and slides him off the
blade then discards his body

The other jock cowering in terror backs into a corner

JOCK 2
No stop

The Lunch Lady raises her knife in the air about to
bring it down on him when-

SHE IS SLAMMED SIDEWAYS

Hitting the wall the knife clattering to the ground and
turning to see-

CASSIE
Holding her baseball bat ready for action

CASSIE
Mom Leave them alone

Her mother’s hideous face BELLOWS OUT a deafening
monstrous cry and she moves straight towards her
knocking the jock aside and-

HITTING CASSIE IN THE CHEST

Pushing her backwards through a door into the other room

EXT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

Patrick fights through the crowds of hysterical
teenagers trying to make his way towards Vlad and Razor
fighting in the street

Vlad grabs Razor by the jaw His hand squeezes his teeth
when Razor-

BITES DOWN
Drawing blood from Vlad’s hand and causing him to recoil

Razor stands raising his one good hand slicing it
across Vlad’s face

Vlad turns over onto his stomach and begins to crawl
away Razor stands over him and kicks him in the
stomach forcing him to roll over just a Razor brings his
good hand down and-

PLUNGES IT INTO HIS EXISTING WOUND
This time going clear through to the ground pinning Vlad
in place Vlad tries to sit up but Razor slams him with

the nub of his severed arm

ON RAZOR’S EYES wild with fury

INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cassie sits up and shakes herself off throwing away the
splinters of the broken door

Her mother comes at her again when Cassie reaches into
the closet wrapping her hands around a bottle of MACE
tied to a stove lighter which she turns on and-

IGNITES A LONG FLAME

That shoots out across the room and narrowly misses the
Lunch Lady She retreats backwards but the fire reaches
the other wall where it hits-

THE TISSUE PAPERS

Lighting them on fire and setting off a chain reaction
that causes the entire room to pick up in flames

CASSIE
Brilliant Cass

The Lunch Lady comes back at Cassie but she quickly grabs
another weapon out of her bag of tricks

AN ELECTRIC DRILL

Which she switches on as she spins around and-

DIGS IT THROUGH HER MOTHER’S REACHING HAND

The Lunch Lady screams out withdrawing her hand and

yanking the drill out of Cassie’s grip Then she takes

Cassie by the neck and presses her against the wall

SLAMS CASSIE’S HEAD

Patrick gives Kyle a long look then turns and runs in

INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cassie comes to shaking off her massive headache and
looks around to see she is surrounded by flames Picking

up her “KISS IT” bat she discovers an opening and runs
through it

INT CASSIE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The whole house is beginning to burn Cassie can barely
see her way through the smoke

to see her

Above her the hole that she fell in earlier leading to

Vlad uses what strength he has left to lift himself
upwards picking up Razor with his hand still digging
into his chest and-

SLAMMING HIM SIDEWAYS INTO A LAMP POST

Razor cringes as his arm bends backwards and SNAPS Then
he withdraws his hands and-

KICKS VLAD BACKWARDS

The two stand facing off Razor reaches to his broken
arm and SNAPS IT BACK INTO PLACE Sneers again

Vlad injured looks at him wearily He just can’t bring
thisguy down Razor comes at him again when suddenly-

her sides Takes another step closer

CASSIE (CONT’D)

If you want to take anyone from
this world you better take me
I’ve got nothing left to prove
I’m not angry over things I can’t
change

(pauses)
Not like you

The Lunch Lady raises the knife just as Cassie suddenly
runs towards her and-

DIVES IN

Knocking Patrick sideways and out of harm’s way She
grabs her mother’s wrist stopping the knife and holding
it there jut inches from her own throat

CASSIE (CONT’D)
You’re not my mother You’re just
the dead part that’s left over
The Lunch Lady stares at her suddenly afraid when-
CRASH
A lumbering form leaps in through the window behind her

knocking into the Lunch Lady and slamming her into the
wall Cassie turns to see-

VLAD

Injured badly from his tussle with Razor but still with
enough juice left to give the Lunch Lady the fight of her
undead life

She’s got a lot of strength in her too shoving him aside
and flipping herself around to gain the upper hand She
knocks off his filtration mask and grabs his face
Squeezing as hard as she can cracking bone until-

CASSIE’S BAT LODGES IN HER HEAD

( )

The Lunch Lady twists around but Cassie forces her head
down by guiding the bat She plants her neck on the
ground and-

SWINGS

Multiple times beating the monster savagely until
there’‘s little left

CASSIE (CONT’D)
Vlad

He tosses her the machete which she grabs mid-air and-
CUTS DOWN

On her neck slicing off her mother’s head entirely It
goes plummeting through the gap in the floor towards the
raging fire below Cassie kicks the rest of the Lunch

Lady’s motionless body and it rolls over the ledge also

ON THE CORPSE burning in the fire until there’s nothing
left

Cassie looks down at Vlad and Patrick
CASSIE (CONT’D)
I don’t know about you but I’m
about done with this homecoming

Vlad just smiles through broken teeth

Patrick watches the flames as they rise through the hole
The whole house is coming down around them

PATRICK
Maybe this would be a good time to
make our exit

CASSIE
Right on

She extends a hand to Vlad as we-

She backs up against the opposite wall through a pile of
haystacks grabbing a PITCHFORK off a rack and clinging
to it like it’s her sole chance of survival

SOUNDS OF MOANING

All around her Grunting People banging up against the
walls of the shack Finally-

Bursts through a weak ply in the wall reaching around
and grabbing her The girl screams out as-

A mixture of sun and some chemical disfigurement snarls
