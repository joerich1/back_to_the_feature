FADE INTO

SEPIA-TONE FOOTAGE

of a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an
elephant Noahs Ark going round and round and
round

EXT GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY

Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and
fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal

JON ARCHER rising winged Pegasus On the adjacent
unicorn is his son MATTHEW Clutching a balloon
Matty waves at his dad A happy moment like so many
certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching
them THROUGH

SNIPERS RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPERS EYES

wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the
target They round the bend and disappear

MATTHEW

Loses his grip on the unicorn Archer reaches over and
pulls him into his lap They happily ride together

As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW exposing Archer

Now we see the sniper CASTOR TROY is cool efficient
aggressive sexual His finger closes around the
trigger

BOOM A BULLET RIPS into Archers back Bleeding he
drops off his horse and sinks to the deck of the
carousel His eyes desperately searching searching
searching until he sees --

Matthew lies on his back -- still Slowly Archer
reaches out and takes Matthews hand and now we see
COLOR for the first time

Blood red as bleeding father touches bleeding son
TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full
color and UP UP UP TO Matthews red balloon floating

away

HANDELS MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS

FBI BRIEFING ROOM

Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below
is Jon Archer older unshaven fatigued his
eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession

CAROUSEL HORSE

sweeps by as if marking time itself

HOLY PLACE

Smoky spiritual dominated by a gleaming golden
cross A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer The
glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS but its just a
light-reflection off the casing of a large bomb This
is no chapel but an atrium Somewhere

And as the priest rubs out his cigarette we see its
Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device

ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE

sweeps by

ARCHER

pockets his FBI badge then holsters his gun
CASTOR

sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in
front of it Totally hidden

BRIEFING ROOM - CASTORS MUGSHOT

is on a computer screen His criminal dossier scrolls by
endlessly bombings assassinations mercenary
kidnappings terrorism-for-hire

Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully Other
agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid-
maps man phones etc amid the take-out cartons and
coffee cups These people are on high alert

ARCHER
Any follow-up from LAPD
Intelligence

BUZZ
No sir nothing yet

ARCHER
Get them on the phone -- now
What about SIS and our airport
teams

WANDA

Weve had everything from psychics
to satellites on this Even if
Castor was here he must have
slipped the net by now

ARCHER
Hes here And were going to
keep looking until we find him

A silence descends on the chastised team As they go
back to work veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer
aside

TITO
Jon these people have been
working round the clock -- you
gotta cut them some slack

Archer considers his best friends advice -- then
ARCHER
Ill cut them some slack when I
cut myself some slack

Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him

INT CORRIDOR - DAY (MORNING)

Castor quietly shuts the security door behind him An
Hispanic voice startles him

JANITOR
What are you doing

CASTOR
(in perfect Spanish)
Thank goodness I feel like Icarus
in the labyrinth -- wheres the
mens room

JANITOR
(in Spanish)
This area is off limits Padre
(re security door)
How did you get in that room

Realizing the JANITOR is already too suspicious Castor

puts a priestly arm around him -- and leads him down the
hall
CASTOR
Okay I have a confession to

make but you arent gonna like
it I was planting a bomb

JANITOR
Bomb
CASTOR
You know -- boom --
(patting his

neck)
Oh never mind

The Janitor suddenly twitches his eyes rolls up in his
head As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a
stairwell Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in
Castors hand

Castor kicks the Janitors mop and bucket down the stairs
-- making everything look like an accident
INT SAME BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - DAY (MORNING)

The childrens church choir -- 200 strong -- sing Behold
the Lamb of God Clergy and lay persons listen
reverently

Father Castor strolls by the singers -- casually
heading for the exit As he passes the risers a teenage
girl drops her sheet music at his feet

Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close hes
practically licking it

CASTOR
Ive never enjoyed The Messiah
But your voice makes even a hack
like Handel seem like a genius

He pats her behind and leaves Although a little shaken
shes also drawn by Castors sexual magnetism

EXT LA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY (MORNING)

The marquee proclaims INTERNATIONAL CHURCH CHOIRS 18th-
21st AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION

Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop

INT ARCHERS OFFICE - DAY (MORNING)

The office is a monument to obsession photographs
clues newsclips totems of Castor Troy surround a pacing
Archer

ARCHER
(on phone)

I dont have time to get a
warrant from some hung-over judge
Just give me the go-ahead Victor
and I promise -- as soon as this
is over -- you can brand my butt
with the Fourth Amendment

The instant Archer hangs up -- the INTERCOM BUZZES
KIM (VO)

Sir your wifes on line one
SIS on two
ARCHER
Tell her to hang on --

As Archer punches up line two -- Tito bursts in

TITO
A jet was chartered at Anderson
Airfield Guess who just showed
up to pay for it Pollux Troy

ARCHER
Scramble the Reaction Team --
were moving out And get one of
our people on that plane

TITO
But theres still no sign of
Castor

ARCHER

Where one brother goes the
others sure to follow

They rush our the hold button on line 1 still
blinking

EXT PRIVATE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A sleek Cadillac pulls in stopping next to a Land
Rover

LARS MUELLER -- a muscular crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets
out of the Caddy An instant later -- LUNT MUELLER --

emerges from the Rover They are identical twins
The men scan the airport carefully then open the rear
doors of their respective vehicles Castor emerges from

the Caddy -- Armani clad

Exiting the Rover is Castors younger brother POLLUX TROY

-- skittish brilliant paranoid -- a human hummingbird
POLLUX
Youre 26 minutes late The
casing didnt fit -- right I

knew that cheap-shit Dietrich
would rip us off

CASTOR
Oh God --
POLLUX

What
CASTOR
I forgot to turn the damn thing
on
POLLUX

Youre kidding right
(to the twins)
Hes kidding
(grabs Castor
by throat)
are you fucking kidding

Castor hugs Pollux lovingly Pollux squirms like a kid

CASTOR
Bro -- everything went fine

POLLUX
I hate when you call me bro

Pollux heads for the jet Castor hands Lunt a wad of
cash

CASTOR
Thanks for babysitting

LUNT
Anything else

CASTOR
Ill contact you when we get the
rest of the money
(turns to leave)
Oh and stat away from downtown
The inversion layers going to be
pretty thick around the 18th

The twins nod then take off Castor heads for the
jet

INT JET - DAY

Castor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT

CASTOR
Lets go lets go
As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE Castor sinks into his
seat A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him
a Scotch He downs it looking her over salaciously

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Would you like anything else

CASTOR
Hell yes
(pulls her into lap)
Its the only way to fly
She smiles not minding until the jet suddenly slows its

taxi down the runway

COCKPIT

Castor yanks open the door

CASTOR
Whats wrong
AT END OF RUNWAY
A squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway

EXTINT HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

Behind the wheel is Jon Archer Beside him is Tito

BACK TO ARCHER

CASTOR
Its Archer
(gun to Pilots
head)
Go dammit

Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castors hand he turns
around to see the Flight Attendant behind them --
holding a smoking pistol This is Agent WINTERS

WINTERS
FBI Throttle down captain

But Castor elbows the throttle up The jet lurches
forward throwing Winters off balance Pollux tackles
her as the jet picks up speed
INT HUMVEE - DAY
Archer slams the vehicle into gear

ARCHER
Get out

TITO
Youre not playing chicken with

two tons of aluminum

ARCHER
Get out

Tito obeys as Archer peels out The HUMMER ROARS at the
jet

The jet picks up speed trying to get aloft

The humvee is aimed right at it Archers eyes narrow

COLLISION COURSE

as two hunks of metal bear down The machines are
seconds apart when --

Archer looks up to see

Winters face pressed up against the cockpit window
Castor holding a gun to her head

Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet The
Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but
too late Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a

swirl of dust

As the jet picks up speed the hatch opens Castor
blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the
tarmac

INSIDE

Castor smiles at Pollux sensing freedom until

KA-CHUNK Something POUNDS the jet -- from above
Castor leans out the hatch and sees

The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls
Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men
Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch

The choppers left windscreen spiderwebs Archer jerks
and weaves -- dodging the BULLETS The chopper pulls

away

The jet finally lifts off when

The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail
TARMAC
Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a

deadly game of leap-frog with the jet
The end of the runway is coming up fast

Archer crushes the jets horizontal elevator flap

JET PILOT

cant budge the jets jammed yoke Thwarted he powers
back the throttle Thrust reverse

CASTOR
What are you doing

PILOT
The horizontal elevators smashed
We cant lift off

CASTOR

SHOOTS the Pilot -- then takes the controls He
struggles to maneuver the jet Suddenly

A biplane descends right at them -- about to land

ARCHER

pulls up just as the JET swerves radically to avoid the
biplane and SLAMS into the hangar
plows through the GLASS DOOR the NOSE-WHEEL SNAPS off
The PLANE SKIDS right into the hangar -- finally stopping
at the wings

FBI CHOPPER

lands Archer steps out calmly -- like a cop about to
write a traffic ticket He hurries to join more FBI
agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him

INT HANGAR - DAY

The jet hatch pops open -- Castor leaps from it FIRING
Two FBI agents drop -- riddled
Pollux appears at the hatch -- an FBI sharpshooter FIRES

grazing Polluxs shoulder Staggered Pollux falls --

Castor catches him before he hits the floor --
simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter

Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar
Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents his
anger building He signals Tito and the others to spread
out

DEEP IN HANGAR

A maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery Led by
Archer the FBI agents pick their way through it

ROOKIE LOOMIS snaps alert -- did he see something
Advancing carefully he comes up on

Castor -- staunching Polluxs shoulder wound Pollux
sees the agent -- and FIRES
Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded

Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux

Tito is at the wheel Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to
dive off The forklift careens on -- driving apart the
brothers

The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning
Pollux Castor tries to free his trapped brother

POLLUX
Forget it -- Go Go

He slaps his Glock into Polluxs hand

CASTOR
Wherever they put you Ill finda
way to get you out

Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs
through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar

Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Polluxs
head As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand

TITO
-- not unless you want that 200
IQ splattered all over the
floor
(as Archer
approaches)
We got him now Jon

ARCHER
Thats what you always say Seal
it off Im going in

Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel

MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse
dance

Sensing Archer Castor pauses by an old landing gear He
draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on

Archer pauses at the landing gear his own stealthy
movements mirroring Castors

Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums his gaze
trying to penetrate the darkness He SNAPS his fingers
The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in

Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering
the challenge As the deadly beat between them

continues --

BLAM BLAM BLAM Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS
FIRE from the gloom one step ahead

INTERCUT as necessary
CASTOR
Jon Im getting a little annoyed
by your obsessive need to spoil my
fun

ARCHER
And how much will your fun net
you this time

BOOM BOOM BOOM Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning
A moment later Archer pursues SNAP He fits a new
CLIP into his pistol

CASTOR
Whats it to you I declare it
Here I am back in the States for
less than a week --

ARCHER
Youre under arrest Incredibly
you still have the right to remain

silent --

CASTOR
Ive got something going down on
the eighteenth its gonna be

worse than anything God ever
dumped on the Pharaoh Ill give

it up -- but my brother and I have
to walk

ARCHER
No discussion -- no deals

CASTOR

Whatre you gonna do with me
locked up Youll drive your wife
and kid nuts I bet your daughter
is just about ripe by now Whats
her name Janie

Enraged Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw
his enemy out Silence -- then Archer senses

Castor is behind him He FIRES -- Archer dives away
The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two
huge turbine engines As Archer reloads he stares at
the control panel switches

Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP-
SNAP Except it isnt a finger snap its two
switches

VRRRROOOM The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on Unable to fight
the churning tornado-force wind Castors blasted
across the hangar slamming hard into the far wall

The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito

TITO
Tell me he didnt get away
again

Then Tito follows Archers gaze to Castors lifeless
body Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile
survives

EXT AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET

Heavily-manacled an extremely agitated Pollux is herded
into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda

POLLUX
Wheres my brother I want to
see my brother

The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man
flanked by two bodyguards Bullying through the media
Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the
devastation

Approaching Archer he watches as Castors body is loaded
on the ambulance A sheet covers Castors lifeless face

LAZARRO
The oversight committee wouldve
roasted us for this one -- thank

God it paid off Damn fine work

ARCHER
Real fine Victor Especially the
casualties

Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three
bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked
Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the
bodies

Instinctively the two men close ranks Archer grabs the
Nikon ejects the film then shoves the camera back

LAZARRO
Classified information No
photographs

Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archers shoulder and
leads him away from the media and the carnage

LAZARRO
You okay Jon
(off Archers nod)
Then go home Tell Eve

EXT ARCHERS HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET
A renovated Craftsman Sipping a carton of milk Archer

pulls into the driveway He sits gathering his
thoughts

INT ARCHERS HOME - NIGHT

Archer enters and sees his wife EVE Handsome
intelligent

ARCHER
Hi
(no response)
Whats wrong
She nods toward the KITCHEN JAMIE is there -- a sullen

and hard fifteen-year-old There are cigarette cartons
on the table

EVE
She complimented for her F in
history with an A in
shoplifting

Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of
Marlboros Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee

ARCHER
Nice stunt Jamie You break the
law and Im expected to ignore it

JAMIE
Thats right -- its all about
you Dont even ask me what

happened

Archer looks to Eve for help Eve shakes her head --
nope
ARCHER
Okay What happened

JAMIE
Like youd ever fucking believe
me
She bolts In anticipation Eve calmly opens the door as

Jamie rushes out then closes it behind her

EVE
Well you tried You failed
miserably but you tried

ARCHER
Why wont she even talk to me

EVE
Maybe because you taught her never
to speak to strangers

(immediately
regrets it)
Im sorry that wasnt fair
Eve kisses his cheek -- then gathers up her doctor gear
EVE
Ive got patients waiting Try
again Jon She hates you -- but

she needs you

ARCHER
Eve

Something in Archers expression makes her stop

EVE
Jon -- what is it
But hes too overcome He starts to speak -- but cant
EVE
Is it -- him Its its over

Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks
up Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them
both

ARCHER
Im going to make everything up to
you and Jamie Ill put in fora
desk job Well go away get
counseling -- anything you want
This time I mean it

INT ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

Freshly dressed Archer heads down the hall He pauses
at the door to Jamies room when he sees -- Jamie

Fully clothed shes fast asleep on her bed cluttered
with clothes and assorted girl-stuff Her face peaceful

Archer looks around her room sees the stuffed animals
collecting dust replaced by makeup jewelry beefcake
Calvin Klein ads and band posters etc

Archers startled to see a lacey bustier his little
girl is growing up fast And hes missing it

He pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out
The instant he leaves Jamie kicks the blankets off

INT FBI BUILDING - DAY

Dominated by the FBI seal Archer steps to the check
point

SECURITY GUARD
Print please

Archer presses his thumb to a scan-pad -- and is cleared

INT BULL PEN - DAY

Efficient as a beehive -- agents cryptologists support
staff buzz at their routines Archer strides through --
drawing congratulatory nods and thumbs up signs

OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE

Archers team is there Applauding Proud Uneasy with
plaudits he disperses the disappointed agents

ARCHER
Much appreciated Now lets get
back to work okay

WANDA
(to Buzz)
Is that stick ever gonna fall out
of his ass

Archers well-built secretary -- KIM BREWSTER -- hands

him his messages

Perignon

He enters

KIMBERLY
The CIA sent this over What
should I do with it

ARCHER
Send it back and tell them to stop
wasting the taxpayers money
Anything else Miss Brewster

KIMBERLY
No sir

Shes holding a bottle of Dom

his office Kimberly sighs and turns to Wanda

KIMBERLY
Four years -- and he still calls
me Miss Brewster

INT ARCHERS OFFICE - DAY

Sitting at his computer -- Archer scrolls through
Castors file He grimly contemplates face-after-face of
Troys victims -- finally pausing on a photo of his son
Matthew

Burying his feeling

comes in

ARCHER
Hows Loomis

TITO
He needs some surgery but hes
going to be okay Thats the good
news

ARCHER
Go on

TITO
Brodie and Miller from Special
Ops need to see you

he types CASE CLOSED over
Castors image Archer starts to press enter

when Tito
ARCHER
I dont have time for those cloak
and dagger guys

Big NED BRODIE and athletic female HOLLIS MILLER stroll
in

BRODIE
You better make time Jon
(hefts a disc)
We found this in the jet wreckage
-- among Pollux Troys effects

Archer accedes as Miller pops in the disk The computer
screen displays a CAD schematic of the bomb Archer

studies it carefully -- unease growing
ARCHER
Porcelain casing Thermal

cloak Undetectable payload

MILLER
Powerful enough to flatten ten
city blocks

ARCHER
‘Worse than anything God ever
dumped on the Pharaohs
(to Tito)
Get Pollux Troy Now

DISSOLVE TO

INTERROGATION FOOTAGE

Wired to a complex machine -- Pollux seems to have his
frustrated interrogators on the run

INT ARCHERS OFFICE - DAY

Archer Lazarro Tito Brodie Miller and other FBI
officials watch the monitor Pollux remains implacable

POLLUX (VO)
(on screen)
That bomb was just a crossword
puzzle to me a mental exercise
I never built it
Lazarro shuts down the monitor turns to Archer

ARCHER
Hes lying

LAZARRO
Hes hooked up to a full-spectrum
polygraph

ARCHER
Pollux is a manipulative
psychopath He can control his
heartbeat his sweat glands his
blood pressure

LAZARRO
Jon I trust your instincts I
always have But DC wants more
evidence And frankly so do I

ARCHER
Youll get all the evidence you
need when ten thousand people die

LAZARRO
Well get a team right on it But
we cant evacuate the city on what
amounts to a hunch

Archer looks at the gathered brass He knows its
hopeless

ARCHER
That bomb has been built its out
there somewhere and its going to
detonate

EXT FBI BUILDING - INTELLIGENCE MEMORIAL - DAY
Words etched in the granite wall read

IN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS
OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES
IN THE LINE OF DUTY

Archer watches as a workman engraves the last of the
three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring
the dead

BRODIE
Didnt Castor give any clue where
the bomb might be

ARCHER
Only one person knows -- his
brother Pollux And hell keep
his mouth shut until it blows

BRODIE
We could plant an agent in his
cell -- get him to spill the
location

ARCHER

Pollux is way too paranoid The
only person hed talk to about
that bomb is Castor himself And
dead men cant talk

Brodie and Miller exchange a knowing look
BRODIE

There might be a way around
that

FULL SCREEN - CASTORS BODY

Tubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice

INT ICU ROOM - DAY

Archer stares at the body he cant believe it

ARCHER
Why are you keeping him alive
(gets no answer)
As long as hes breathing hes
dangerous

MILLER
Relax hes a turnip

Miller grinds out her cigarette on Castors leg
course Castor just lies there like a vegetable

BRODIE
We can arrange for you to enter
Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy

ARCHER

Of
What are you talking about
Archer turns as DR MALCOLM HOAG (50s) enters the room

HOAG
think Id better answer that
question
(offers hand)
Malcolm Hoag I run the
Physiological Camouflage Unit for
Special Ops

ARCHER
know who you are

MILLER

But you dont know what he can do
Physical augmentation enhancement
surgery

BRODIE
He can disguise a compromised
agent or alter the likeness --
even the voice -- of a government
witness

HOAG
Let me show you how its done
(leading him out)
I think youll recognize our
patient

INT HOAGS SURGICAL BAY - DAY

Loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away
charred flesh around his burned ear The doctor turns to
a--

STEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE

Laser-beams attack an organic soup with incredible
precision The light forces a chemical reaction -- and
out of the soup -- an ear begins to form It rises from
the liquid now fully-formed The surgeon takes the ear
and fits it in place on Loomiss head He starts
suturing

OBSERVATION BOOTH - ABOVE
Archer Hoag Brodie and Miller watch the operation --
video-enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls

HOAG

With our new generation of anti-
inflammatories healing is
accelerated from weeks to days
By his next paycheck he wont
even remember which ear he lost

(a beat)
Your situation however would be
a little less permanent

BRODIE
-- and a lot more classified

Hoag holds up a face-sized organic shell made up of
yellow cartilage pieces and tendons etc Archer pulls
it over his face -- like a gauze mask A tendon falls
off

ARCHER
This1ll fool Pollux

HOAG
That is a state-of-the-art morpho-
genetic template The inside can
be built to match the exact shape
of your skull the outside --
exactly like Castors Then we
fit his face right on top --

MILLER
-- and you become him

ARCHER
Youre talking about removing the
guys face

BRODIE
Borrowing Jon The procedures
completely reversible

MILLER
One way or the other -- the
mission ends on the eighteenth

Archer turns the shell over and over and over in his
hands

BRODIE
You know Castor better than
anyone Youve lived and breathed
him for years -- hell you even
look a little like him

Archer shoves the template back at Hoag

ARCHER
Find yourself another lab-rat

MILLER
If you dont do this -- Castor
will beat us again Hell beat
you again

Archer pushes his way past them -- and marches out

HOAG
I dont think that went very well

BRODIE
Trust us Doc
MILLER
hell jerk around Then hell

be back

INT INTERROGATION BOOTHS - DAY

Archer enters sizes up DIETRICH HASSLER His stylish
garb doesnt completely hide his criminal roots Archer
sits down calmly He looks at his watch

ARCHER
Im in a hurry Dietrich So
youve only got ten seconds to go
through your usual litany of lies
empty threats and moronic
denials Then Im coming over
there --

DIETRICH
If youre in such a fucking hurry
-- why are you wasting your time
with me Im just an art dealer

ARCHER
Youre a dealer all right
technical secrets munitions
explosives

DIETRICH
Youve never proven any of that
And when my bitchy never-been-
laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here
shes going to

ARCHER
Times up

Archer topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the
top Brandishing it -- he stalks the startled thug

HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Lazarro blanches as an obsessed Archer repeatedly slams
the table leg against the wall -- above Dietrichs head

LAZARRO
The only ticking bomb I see is
inside his head Hes getting
worse Tito

TITO
Dont worry sir Its all an
act
But as Lazarro leaves -- we see Titos worried too

BACK INSIDE BOOTH

Archer has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner

DIETRICH
Okay Castor called me but I
blew him off I swear I never

saw him And I dont know
anything about any bomb
INT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION BOOTHS - SAME TIME
Archer emerges eyes blazing
ARCHER
Let him go but I want him

watched Whos next

TITO
Just Dietrichs sister

In another booth a careworn but striking woman sits with
a little boy on her lap She gently helps him Crayola a
book This is SASHA HASSLER and her son ADAM INT INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

Archer hovers over Sasha -- her maternal warmth replaced
by an icy hatred Tito and the child are gone

ARCHER
When was the last time you saw
Castor Troy

SASHA
Who cares Hes dead

ARCHER
Answer the question

SASHA
Look Im clean I teach kids
now --

ARCHER
Sasha -- you are a felon on

probation for harboring Castor
Troy So its in your best
interest to cooperate

(as shes silent)
Would you like your son put ina
foster home

Sashas eyes flash her body coils -- but she keeps
control

SASHA
No but Im sure youd love it --
you sick bastard

ARCHER
(unmoved)
When was the last time you saw
Castor Troy

She stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred
SASHA

I havent seen him for years

INT CORRIDOR - DAY
Archer watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into

Sashas arms She hugs him protectively Adam sees
Archer watching them -- and smiles Archer doesnt smile
back

FULL SCREEN - CASTORS REAL FACE

PULL BACK TO

INT ICU - NIGHT

Archer slowly circles Castors muscular hairy tattooed
body Although on life support -- his signature smirk
remains

ARCHER
What about Lazarro

BRODIE
No way -- the red tape alone would
take a month This is a black-bag
operation -- completely off the
books

MILLER

If you need him Tito can help you
prepare But you know the drill

You cant tell anyone -- not the
Director not your wife nobody
Archers face shows he doesnt like it -- then he nods
ARCHER
Im in

EXT ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

Archer slowly gets out of his car Trudging toward the
front door he picks up a basketball and takes a shot
His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Archer passes Jamies room Loud MUSIC POUNDS from
within He pauses to knock thinks again then heads
down the hall
INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eve is in bed Archer comes in quietly and sits beside
her -- studying her peaceful sleeping face She stirs

EVE
I was dreaming

ARCHER
Something good

EVE
Im not sure you were flying
this weird old stunt plane
doing flips walking on the
wings I was watching from the
ground -- when you fell You had
a parachute but you wouldnt open
it

ARCHER
Did you catch me

EVE
No

ARCHER
How come

EVE

I dont know

(nuzzles him)
Maybe because youve never needed
my help

ARCHER
Come on you made that up didnt
you

EVE
Maybe I did
(teasing)
maybe I didnt

They kiss affectionately Passion building Eve runs her

hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round
scar on his chest Archer freezes -- mid-caress
EVE

Its all right Jon

ARCHER
After all these years I still
cant get it out of my head -- an
inch to the left Matty would
still be alive

EVE
And you wouldnt be

No response The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve

EVE
Things will get better now that
youre home Everything will be
better -- now that that man is
finally out of our lives

ARCHER
Eve

He starts to say the words He wants needs to share the
truth with her But he cant Instead --

ARCHER
If I had to do something to
find some closure I should do
it shouldnt I No matter how
crazy

EVE
Oh God -- youre going on
assignment again

ARCHER
One last time And while Im
gone I want you and Jamie to go
to your mothers Its
important

EVE
You said youd be here You
promised What could be more
important than that

ARCHER
I cant tell you except only I
can do it

EVE

You want me to tell you its okay
to leave Okay go on Go

Fury erupting Eve pushes Archer out of the bed
INT ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Archer enters a childs room -- neat and tidy like a
museum exhibit A starfield of glow-letters twinkles

INT EXT 56 BUICKMOUNTAIN ROAD - MOVING - DAY
Tito drives into the Hoag compound

Archers beside him juggling Castors dossier
documents photos etc

TITO
Jon this is goddam insane You
cant do it

Archer says nothing its too late for debate Tito
parks The men get out and head for the lab

TITO
You havent got a chance in hell
of fooling Pollux Castor drinks
smokes and walks around with a 24-
hour hard-on Hes nothing like
you --

ARCHER
Dont worry If Hoag can do half
what he claims Ill get Pollux to
talk

Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him
TITO

Its not that simple Jon
Becoming another person --
especially him -- nobody can come
all the way back from that not
even you

Archer considers his friends words He toys with then
removes his wedding bang

ARCHER
Keep this for me

As Tito takes the ring -- a caring but concerned look
passes between the two friends

INT SURGICAL BAY - DAY

Two huge video screens are dominated by the CG-images of
Archer and Castor As Hoag briefs the team the CG-
images glow to reflect the physical characteristic Hoag
refers to

HOAG
Lets walk through it Jon Your
blood types are different but we
cant do anything about that
Otherwise nature is cooperating
nicely The height difference is
negligible -- within 12 an inch
Eye color -- almost a perfect
match Penis size flaccid
essentially the same --
Substantial

From the observation booth above -- Miller (flanked by
Tito and Brodie) raises his eyebrow

On the video screens the images morph to signify the
physical augmentations

HOAG
Hairline will be adjusted with
laser-shears micro-plugs for

the body hair the teeth will be
bonded to match Castors

Hoag eyes Castors inert tight body -- then turns to
Archer -- prodding his love handles like a livestock
inspector

HOAG

How about an abdominoplasty
ARCHER
Abdomino -- what

HOAG
A tummy tuck On the house

ARCHER
Do it

TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE

(INTERCUT huge video screen enlargements of Archer and
Castors body parts as necessary)

Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archers
obliques At the same time

Hoag recreates the Great Sphinx tattoo on Archers
thigh We PUSH IN ON his leg then PULL BACK to
reveal

Archer and Tito The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL
SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself
Tito demonstrated the proper Castor gait dangerously
casual like a panther

Hoag reproduces Castors fingerprints then layers them
over Archers fingers

Archer practices Castors icy killer glare Tito hands
him a lit cigarette Archer brings the cigarette to his
lips -- then coughs harshly But he keeps trying

Castor smiles then smirks and laughs PULL BACK to
reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on
a monitor-screen -- mimicking him

Archer fusses with his new hair trying to cover the thin
spots Giving up he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting
the zipper caught in his new chest hair

EXT HOAG INSTITUTE - GROUNDS - DAY

Tito tosses a pistol Archer catches it with his right
hand But to Archers surprise Tito frowns

TITO
Nice catch But you used the
wrong hand
He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archers left
hand Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly

TITO
Shoot me
(as Archer
doesnt move)
Shoot me

Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead

TITO
You want to be Castor Troy If
you hesitate for a breath youre
finished Now -- shoot me Kill
me

Archer holds the gun unsteadily Tito is disgusted
TITO
You cant do it because Castor
is tougher than you
BOOM The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Titos
head Shocked he touches his left ear making sure its

still there

Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination

EXT HOAGS FACILITY - NIGHT

Clear and calm Gods night Someones God anyway

INT ICU ROOM - NIGHT
Hoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror

HOAG
Lets see if I missed anything
before I get my hands really dirty

Archer removes the robe Hes amazed to see
His own head on Castors body a flat stomach hairy
chest tattoos thinning hair etc Hoag touches

Archers scar

HOAG
You realize this has to be
removed

(as Archer

slowly nods)
Then here we go Commander
Through the Looking Glass

INT SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

Unconscious Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay
Castor beside him Hoag turns to the video technician

HOAG
Make sure you get everything --
Ill need to study the tape before
the reverse surgery

Hoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archers face
Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma-

Induction-Device (DID) attaches via suction

Hoag sights through the optical memory squeezes the

trigger A cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly
slicing it Then Hoag lifts Archers face -- off of his
skull

Brodie and Miller watch from above Tito stumbles into
the nearby bathroom to throw up

Hoag inspects Archers face then turns to his nurse

HOAG
Vault it

Hoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor

Castors consistent EEG reading suddenly spikes

radically -- for a moment it almost seems to stabilize
Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have
disappeared

But the CAMERA CLOSES IN ON Castors ear -- and we sense

that somehow his auditory nerves might be functioning

DISSOLVE TO

INT RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

A head swathed in gauze The bandages start to fall
away
Tito Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze
The patient looks into a mirror

Jon Archer has become Castor Troy

he touches his new face Archer stares the cold
reality chilling his blood

Archer buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what hes
done to himself For a moment he seems to teeter on
madness

TITO
Jon -- are you all right
Archer cant respond hes somewhere the others cant
comprehend Finally he emerges shaken but in

control

TITO enters Instinctively he grabs for his holster

ARCHER

Okay Im okay
(realizes)

But my voice I still sound like
me

HOAG
I implanted a micro-chip onto your
larynx

Hoag SWITCHES ON an AUDIO TAPE Archer repeats Castors
words as Hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box

CASTOR (VO) ARCHER
Okay Ive gota Okay Ive gota
confession to make but confession to make but
you arent gonna like you arent gonna like
it (etc) it (etc)

After a few repetitions Archers voice matches
perfectly

Archer yawns squints and furrows his brow -- testing
every muscle He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes
of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes Archer slowly
turns to

Castor Motionless swathed dead to the world -- but
something about Castors smile -- that mocking smile

ARCHER
Now what

TITO
Were down to 72 hours Lets
call Lazarro Castor Troy just
came out of his coma

EXT FBI HELIPORT - DAY

Armed agents take their positions around a helipad A
jet-black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry
wasp

EXT HELIPAD - DAY

As Lazarro watches -- Tito escorts out a heavily-manacled
Castor Two armed agents leap from the chopper and
take charge of Castor He follows them pliantly
until --
TITO

Watch this hard-case -- hell bite

your nuts off if he gets the

chance

Archer gets the message He starts to resist the agents
and must be muscled into the chopper Hes manacled
down

Eye contact between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this
very real point of departure The CHOPPER DOOR SLAMS
SHUT It lifts off like a twister and SCREAMS away

EXT HELIPORT - STAGING AREA - DAY

The watching team breaks up wanders back to work

LOOMIS
What a week for Archer to go ona

disappear over the horizon So far so good
INT CHOPPER - FLYING - DAY
The agent re-checks Archers chains
ARCHER

Dont forget -- I ordered a kosher

meal
The agent smashes his elbow into Archers gut The
second agent presses an INJECTOR against Archers leg
PSSSST Archer spasms against the drug -- then sags
unconscious
INT EREWHON PRISON - DELOUSING CUBICLE
Archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him

A guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate

Archer lies gasping on the steel floor protecting his

face The spray stops -- when head guard RED WALTON
enters
WALTON
You are now an Erewhon inmate -- a
citizen of nowhere Human rights

zealots the Geneva convention and
the PC police have no authority
here You have no right

(slaps on latex gloves)
When I say your ass belongs to me
-- I mean it Bend over

Archers face reflects the degradation as he bends over
and exposes all to the cavity-searching Guard

Satisfied Walton lets Archer dress Another guard
places a pair of odd-looking steel boots before Archer

WALTON
Step into them

Archer inspects the lock-down boots Hinged steel
collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle The
soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts

WALTON
Dont sniff em you perv Just
step into them
Archer obeys A guard squats down and locks the steel
collars over Archers shoes He tries to move -- but
cant

ARCHER
Theyre too tight

WALTON

Sos a noose Now keep your mouth
shut

Walton JOLTS Archer with his HIGH-VOLTAGE SHOCK-STICK

WALTON

field The boots1ll tell us where
you are -- every second of the
day

Walton presses his thumb into a standard FBI scan-pad
It forms a print -- positively identifying the guard
The heavy blast-door automatically opens

WALTON
Ive got fifty bucks says youre
dead by dinner Dont disappoint
me

Walton prods Archer toward the door To Archers
surprise -- he can now move

INT GENERAL POPULATION - DAY

The inmates eat Silence descends as Archer enters --
intensifying the constant HUMMING of the MAGNETIC FIELD

Huge Dubov does a slow burn on seeing Castor

Scanning the room for Pollux -- Archer takes a seat next
to a LITTLE GOATEED MAN with a French accent

LITTLE MAN

Hey Castor -- remember me
ARCHER
Fabrice Voisine sure I --

(catches himself)
-- I believe Jon Archer busted you
for poisoning five members of the
the Canadian parliament
VOISINE (LITTLE MAN)
Those scumbags should never have
voted against the Quebecois
(a beat)
We heard you got wasted

Archer sees the other inmates sizing him up

ARCHER
Do I look wasted -- asshole
Voisine shakes his head no -- then his eyes widen as

WHAM Dubov leaps onto Archer and starts pummeling him
They slide across the table -- spilling everyones lunch

GUARD
(into comm-unit)
Central I have a disturbance in
population Go to lock down --

WALTON
(into comm-unit)

Hold that lock down

Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room

Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling
inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed
Especially his brother Pollux -- who watches
uncertainly
Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready He grabs
Dubovs fist -- just before it hits his face
ARCHER
Never -- in -- the -- face

Holding Dubovs fist firmly Archer kicks Dubov
repeatedly in the groin Metal boot meeting soft flesh

Dubov staggers back -- hurt Archer moves in for the
kill savoring it

Walton looks skyward

WALTON
Lock em down

INTERCUT WITH
UP ABOVE - CENTRAL SECURITY

The prisons nerve center -- with video-feeds and
monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a
minimum

The two deputies react to Waltons call Identifying
Archer and Dubovs signature-blips -- they throw the
appropriate switches and

ZAP The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor
Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archers just out of
reach

Crack Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm

ARCHER
What He started it

Walton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor

ARCHER
When I get out of here --

WALTON
Youll what

ARCHER
Im going to have you fired

His statement is so ludicrous Walton laughs Everyone
does From the inmates reactions Archer knows hes
been accepted

WALTON
(to Dubov)
Thats two strikes Dubov One
more and you know where youre

going
(to the others)

Back to your suites -- or no

dinner
As Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux
waiting for him Girding himself for this first
encounter -- hes got a plan

POLLUX
Hey bro

ARCHER
-- Pollux

POLLUX
Of course its Pollux what the
fucks wrong with you

Archer stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods
him forward Pollux watches his brother go -- very
concerned

Archer lies on his cot -- staring at the ceiling

Isolated lonely he realizes how easy it would be to go
insane here

EXT HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT

An insanely starry night Van Goghs night The night
he cut off his ear anyway

INT SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

Castors body lies inert His life-support MACHINES

BLIPPING away Until the EEG spikes Once -- twice --
three times Brain wave activity increases -- and
stabilizes

Castors fingers twitch Then his fist clenches -- hard

Castors head is swathed in gauze But his eyes pop
open

Reflexively Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out
the tubes and wires that tether him to life support He
goes down -- in agony -- groaning

He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab --
until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in
the window He quickly unwraps the gauze

The discarded bandages fall at his feet we dont see
what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN then CHOKE
then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his
cool

Finally composing himself -- Castors hand grips the
phone and he dials

CASTOR
Lars okay Lunt then
(rifling desk
documents)
Something really fucked-up
happened Im in trouble so
listen very carefully

Hoag sees his terrified assistants -- bound with duct
tape
HOAG
Whats this about What do you
want
Lars shoves Hoag into a towering figure we ZOOM IN ON

Hoags glasses And THROUGH the REFLECTION we see

MAN WITHOUT FACE

Hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle cartilage and
bone The man lifts a cigarette to his lips then
exhales

CASTOR
What do you think I want

INT PRISON - POPULATION - DAY

A huge wall-screen plays gentle nature scenes Below --
the inmates engage in their exercise hour

Voisine stares at the screen -- while Pollux carefully
watches his brother play basketball Archer tosses up
an air-ball to the jeers of other inmates

POLLUX
You realize of course that
magnetic humming is designed to
drive us insane If we all dont
get brain tumors first

VOISINE
And that same cloying Bambi tape
-- over and over

POLLUX
Its like theyre begging us to
riot Where the fuck are we

anyway
(the game ends)
Gotta go
Pollux trots over to Archer -- passes him his cigarette
He studies Archer as he takes a drag -- and nearly gags

POLLUX
Im worried about you

ARCHER
Why

POLLUX
Your jumpshot has no arc You
used to swagger now you swish

Youre gumming that butt like a
Catholic school girl

(notices)
And why do you keep picking at
your finger

Pollux has caught Archer reflexively tugging at his
phantom wedding ring Archer immediately stops He
takes a drag and holds it -- then exhales right in
Polluxs face

ARCHER
I was in a coma

Pollux sticks his finger under Archers eye and pulls
down like a vet examining a sick dog Archer pushes him
off

ARCHER
My reflexes my senses my
memory everythings jumbled I

cant even tell you why Dubov
jumped me yesterday

POLLUX
You Pollinated his wife the day he
was arrested How could forget

that

ARCHER

Ive forgotten plenty Look
around -- weve screwed over half
the freaks in here Whats gonna

happen to us if they think
lost it

Ive

Pollux contemplates the other inmates -- circling sizing

up the brothers like hungry sharks

Instinctively

Pollux moves closer to Archer for protection

ARCHER

I need you to play big brother for

once -- till I can fill in

a few

blanks Think you can handle

that

Pollux nods grimly -- then Archer pulls up his sleeve

exposing the pyramid tattoo

ARCHER

I know I got this on my tenth
birthday I just cant remember

why

POLLUX

Man -- that was the worst day of

our lives

Archer feigns a struggle with his memory He lights a
new butt with the old -- chain-style then remembers

ARCHER

Oh God -- Mom O-Dd at County

General

POLLUX

Retching and convulsing while
those bastards didnt even try to
save her sorry ass You gave her
mouth to mouth -- man -- even then

you had some constitution
(a beat)

Remember what you swore to me at

the funeral

ARCHER

Uh -- to kill the doctors
POLLUX
After that You promised youd
always take care of me

ARCHER
And I bet I kept that promise

POLLUX
Only one youve never broken

Pollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort Archer
puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the
trap

ARCHER

Screw the past Weve got the
future to look forward to

(a beat)
We still have tomorrow

POLLUX
No shit five million bucks
now those Red Militia crackpots
get to keep it

ARCHER
Thats not the worst part

POLLUX
Whats worse than losing five
million bucks

ARCHER
Being stuck in this rat-hole when
it blows What you built was a
work of art It belongs in the
Smithsonian

Pollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word

POLLUX
Yeah -- well the LA
Convention Center will have to
do

ARCHER

POLLUX
Thanks I guess they really did
fuck you up
Then Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer Without knowing
exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux

Archer paces impatiently as the door rolls open
Walton is looking at him with cool respect

WALTON

Archer smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodies
timeliness

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Archers boots lock down -- as the guillotine door rises
But his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror
Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of --

Jon Archer This man has Archers face -- his real face

IMPOSTOR
Whats the matter Dont you like
the new me

Archer studies the image of his former self -- trying to
understand Then he recognizes the smirk on the face
the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he
cannot say

ARCHER
-- Castor
CASTOR
Not anymore
ARCHER
It cant be ts impossible
CASTOR
I believe the phrase Dr Hoag used
was titanically remote Who

knows Maybe the trauma of having

my face cut off pulled me out Or

maybe God really is on my side

after all
(starts pacing)

By the way I know you dont get

the papers in here

Continuing to circle he displays the current LA Times

INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead
CASTOR
Terrible tragedy
Hoag was such a genius -- but

selfish with his artistry I
actually had to torture his
assistants to convince him to
perform the same surgery on me

You killed them

CASTOR
Of course I killed them you dumb
fuck Hoag his staff

FLASH ON Hoags body -- on the floor of the burning lab
Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoags

Archers wedding band off the counter

A moment later it backs up and parks

and gets out She doesnt smile back

he reads

What a loser
Castor hears a voice Glancing across the hall he
sees

As she walks back and forth in her room talking on the

Castor steps closer -- enjoying the view
CASTOR

The plot thickens

Castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow
He gazes seductively -- unnerving Jamie as he steps
toward her

CASTOR
I dont think you heard me
Jamie You have something I
want
He reaches for her -- and right past her He picks up a

pack of cigarettes from the desk

JAMIE
Clarissa left those here

lights up)

that somebody would get rich
And I suppose the nation would
be pretty pissed-off

Imagine where that guy could land

Waiting he picks up a handbook You and the FBI A
Primer for New Employees Then

CASTOR
Mr President what an honor

Castor pumps a whacking off gesture with his hand

EXT ARCHERS HOME - DAY

Castor carrying grocery bags comes into the back yard
where Jamie practices free throws He watches her miss

CASTOR
How about a game of horse

JAMIE
Dont make me beat your butt
again Dad Its harmful to my
developing psyche
CASTOR
Afraid youll lose

Castor crisply sinks a free-throw Jamie glares takes
the ball -- and tosses an air-ball

CASTOR
‘AO

Jamie sneers at him He buries another one

CASTOR
Try putting a higher arc on the
ball and square your shoulders
to the basket

Begrudgingly she listens -- and sinks a clean shot
Pleased she nods HONK A BMW pulls into the driveway

JAMIE
Gotta go Karls here

Jamie trots over to greet KARL -- a clean-cut
preppie Opening the car door dor her Karl waves
smiling at Castor Castor studies Karl carefully not
liking what he sees

INT ARCHERS HOME - NIGHT
A tired Eve opens the door Its pitch black inside As
she fumbles for the light switch
MATCH
flares as Castor lights a candle The dining room table
is set for a candlelight dinner He smiles warmly at her
confusion
CASTOR

Dont tell me you forgot Eve --

its date night
DINING ROOM - LATER
Eve looks up from her pasta After an awkward silence

EVE
Why do I feel like Im on a blind
date

CASTOR
Its important to keep some
mystery so things stay

unpredictable

Eve studies him as he pours her more wine Her smile
slowly fades as she realizes whats going on

EVE
Unpredictable Youre about as
unpredictable as the tide

(detached)
How long are you going to be gone
this time

CASTOR
Gone

EVE
snt that what all this is about
The wine cooking me dinner --

CASTOR

EVE
You always say that -- then you

CASTOR

Archer is the most inattentive
sexless spouse on Earth

EVE
Jon thats not true --

CASTOR
Of course its true but Im
trying to change Im here
because I want to be alone with
you I want to see the candle-
light dance in your beautiful --

Uh-oh Castor cant tell the color of Eves eyes He
leans in romantically -- but we know the real reason

CASTOR
-- brown eyes
He smells her hair then her shoulders her skin

aroused but wary So Castor goes in for the kill

CASTOR
I wanted it all to be just
right when I told you about my
promotion

EVE

CASTOR
Well I dont have it yet But
Lazarros getting old -- he wont
be around forever And Im
getting the itch to move up

EVE
Jon thats wonderful

CASTOR
So you see Im not going
anywhere Unless its upstairs
with you

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Castor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the

water
He rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to
carrion As they drop to the floor of the stall --
filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and
whispers

CASTOR

Dirty water runs down a floor drain PULL BACK to

INT EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT
Desolate Archer mops down the rec area
ARCHER

Dont they ever let us take off

VOISINE
Not unless youre sent to the
Clinic

ARCHER
You mean if I get sick

VOISINE
They dont give two fucks about
your health The Clinics where
they send the real hard-cases for
attitude adjustment Dubov just

got sent down -- and look at
Wainwright --
Voisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby -- WAINWRIGHT
-- who sits in a corner -- gnawing at his knuckles
VOISINE

Toughest bastard I ever saw --
after you of course Now hes a
fucking drool case

ARCHER
What did he do

VOISINE
He hit a guard

Archer sees Walton hovering nearby Archer heads for
him

WALTON
Looking for trouble Castor

ARCHER
As a matter of fact -- yes

Crack Archer decks Walton

INT PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT

Walton and a guard herd Archer toward a steel door

INT CLINIC - NIGHT

Archer is dumped on the floor He sees hes lying ina
puddle of something He looks up -- and recoils

ARCHERS POV - DUBOV
is strapped to a vertical gurney -- post-procedure His
limbs are stiff his eyes blank as a mako sharks But

his feet are bare -- bootless
MED-TECH
Wheres the mop he puked all over
the place

An assistant unstraps Dubov and drops him on a gurney

MED-TECH
(mopping up)
-- next time bring them in before
dinner
Archer cases the place Above is a catwalk leading

out

BACK TO SCENE

Walton muscles Archer into the gurney The Med-Tech
smirks

MED-TECH
Oh happy day -- Castor Troy

The Med-Tech wheels the ECT head-gear cart into place
twin needle-like BOLTS ready to fit into ARCHERS ears
A single blue static spark jumps from the bolts

Walton roughly wedges Archers head into the head gear
shoving the chewed-up bite strap into Archers mouth

WALTON
Bite hard scumbag cause youll
be gumming baby food from here on
out

MED-TECH
Get his boots Sergeant

Walton unlocks Archers first boot and pulls it off As
the Med-Tech starts to fasten Archers arm -- Walton
unlocks and pulls off the second boot

Archers feet are free Crack He yanks his foot up
hard -- Walton reels back stunned

One arm still restrained Archer backrolls in the gurney
and kicks the head-gear cart away -- knocking it into the
Med-Tech who collapses onto it hitting Test --

ZAP The HEAD-BOLTS FIRE catching the Med-Tech through
the shoulder -- he drops to the floor his synapses shot

Seeing that Archer is still restrained by the arm -- the
assistant darts out of the room

As Archer pulls free -- Walton looms over him -- gun
poised
Then -- wham Dubov wallops Walton -- using his boots as

brass knuckles The head guard collapses

Dubov smiles dumbly at Archer -- all trace of vendetta
now obliterated Archer nods gratefully -- theyre on
the same team at least for now

Suddenly the ALARM BLARES

Archer sees guards charging the room He tries closing

the door -- but the guards arrive Dubov lumbers over
and puts his massive weight into it -- and slams the door
shut

OS guards POUND at the now-locked door

Archer quickly frisks Walton -- coming up with a
cigarette lighter he pockets it

Scanning around -- Archer leaps onto a mounted hinged
lamp it swings against the wall Archer uses it to
reach the catwalk above

ARCHER
Dubov -- come on

Dubov obeys and follows Archer up onto the catwalk

A groggy Walton muscles open the door from inside
Guards pour in Walton grabs an AUTO-RIFLE and opens
FIRE

SLUGS chase Archer and Dubov as they flee through the
catwalk door

INT CENTRAL SECURITY CONTROL

Two guards watch Archer and Dubov disappear off the

clinics monitor They grab their shock-sticks and rush
for the door
The door opens -- revealing Dubov and Archer Perfectly
in synch -- they double cold-cock the startled guards
Archer grabs a shock-stick -- and fuses the door shut

He yanks out wires and shatters the computers Dubov
mimics the behavior -- ripping out an entire console --
and revealing a narrow cable duct

Flames explode -- shorting the circuitry -- the DRONING
HUM RISES -- the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous
surge

AROUND PRISON

Chaos Guards scatter as the huge diamond-vision SCREEN
EXPLODES and inmates are flung like rag-dolls by their
short-circuiting boots Anything metallic flies into the
magnetic domes

SECURITY CENTRAL

As the men back through the cable duct -- Archer
struggles to replace the heavy console

The DOOR is BLOWN open Walton enters to find no one
Then his eyes light on the console -- slightly askew
INT CABLE CORRIDOR

Archer and Dubov rush down the tight corridor -- and
around the bend The corridor ends in a
STORAGEMAINTENANCE AREA

Lined with tools toilets sinks a rack of old lock-down
boots They race through the far door

INT CENTRAL TOWER ROOM

Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level
labyrinth A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with

catwalks staircases and high walls

ECHOES resound -- SHOUTING FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER --
they seem to be coming from all around them
Over the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and
other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall He pulls one

screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized

wall

Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came
SMASH CUT

SHEER WALL

Archer and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal

boots They climb higher and higher as

Guards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and
around them -- oblivious

Archer and Dubov almost reach the next level when

WALTON
There

BULLETS SMACK the wall around them -- just as Archer and
Dubov reach the next catwalk

Archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far
end But four guards descend on them -- and block their
way

Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking
guards Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more
guards Dubov drops another over the catwalk

They continue their desperate race for the door --
reaching the landing As BULLETS PING around them --
hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel He uses it as a
shield as Archer sparks up Waltons lighter

As SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the
flame to his thumb and peels off the skin mold

He presses his thumb to the doors keypad To his
horror its LED reads print unreadable

Walton and guards movie in FIRING at closer and closer
range

Dubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS The
shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly
disintegrating
Archer licks his thumb tries again Finally it reads

Clearance Confirmed the door slides open
ARCHER
Lets go
Dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but
as he turns to follow Walton BLOWS him away

Archer reaches to pull Dubov through but the riddled
inmate ignores the helping hand Pulling the door shut
he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily

INT HIGH CATWALK TOWER

Archer hesitates for a moment but thats all he has
he keeps going up the winding staircase-catwalk --
higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing
guards

As BULLETS CLANG around him -- Archer reaches the top
He ignores a sign which reads

EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY
SAFETY LINES REQUIRED

He charges straight up a ladder and plows right
through --

SMASH CUT
EXT PRISON - DAWN
Archers blinded -- its daytime in the real world
A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the

bird
PULL WAY WAY BACK to reveal

The prisons in the middle of the goddamn ocean in what
appears to be just an abandoned rusty oil rig platform

Archer rushes over to a transport chopper

INSIDE COCKPIT

Archer searches for the keys No go He throws
switches Nothing works
Guards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING Archer leaps
from the chopper and jumps over the side to the
platforms --

LOWER LEVEL

He lands hard on the slanted corrugated shed roof and
rolls to the ground He grabs a high-pressure hose --
and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards
close in

Archer BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON --
knocking Walton and others into the sea Archer upends a
stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards
Archer spots

TUGBOAT

pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea

Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail --
where the end of a cranes hook is tagged back Under
FIRE -- Archer frees the hook which swings away from the
platform

Hanging on to the hook it swings him out over the ocean
At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into
CHOPPY SEA

He pulls himself into the ZODIAC and frees it from the

tug It ROARS off

EXT ZODIAC - MOVING - DAY

The nylon craft zips through the waves -- approaching San
Pedro Harbor The ENGINE SPUTTERS low on gas
ARCHER
Come on come on
Archer senses something He looks up and
Whoosh Something swoops down -- but its just a
pelican

He FIDDLES with the ENGINE -- which finally DIES Archer
grabs the oars -- about to start rowing when --
Another swoop This time its the prison chopper

Archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor An
idea

WIDE SHOT
The chopper settles over the Zodiac

Wind and water swirl around Archer

CHOPPER

Walton drenched but obviously rescued has archer in his

sights He starts to FIRE his MACHINE GUNS
ZODIAC
BULLETS RAIN down on the boat -- destroying it -- as

Archer dives into the rolling swells

INSIDE CHOPPER

Walton RAKES the debris -- shredding it

The chopper does a final circle of the wreckage then
moves off its ROTOR WASH THRASHING the buoy

UNDER BUOY

Archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy -- sucking
air

EVE

He turns his beeper off then touches her lips with his
finger Without knowing exactly why Eve tenses up

EVE

place

Castor looks around in surprise because he sees shes
driving into --

They drive through the gates -- passing a church marked
ST MARYS-BY-THE-SEA Nearby the OCEAN ROARS

EXT ST MARYS CEMETERY - DAY

Its beautiful here striking and sad Now on foot
Castor follows Eve up a bluff through a phalanx of
graves -- with no idea where shes leading him

Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone Castor
joins her and reads the etched marble stone

Matthew Archer Age 5
Beloved Son and Brother
We Cherish You Always

Stunned Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker

EVE
Happy birthday Matty

She places a few childs toys on the marker a shark
a little bulldozer a spaceship Overwhelmed with
grief she collapses into Castor

EVE
He took our baby Jon He took
our little boy

FULL SCREEN - CASTORS FACE

He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy
whose mother is weeping into his chest

The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly
returns Eves embrace -- maybe just maybe feeling the
victims pain

to puke

She drags him onto the glass floor Cindee puts on some
MUSIC as Archers head begins to spin The girls start

dancing grinding Archer between their taut bodies He
tries to avoid it but Livia kisses him -- hot moist
LIVIA

Remember the Chargers game Caz

Archers eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings

The twisted renderings make his head spin worse as he
starts to hallucinate surrounded by enemies -- he
struggles to regain control of his battered psyche

LIVIA

Archers emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his
big hands dwarfing the little boys body

SASHA
Youre not holding him right
Caz

Archer isnt hearing Sasha Hes lost in his own
memory the sound of a CAROUSEL a KIDS LAUGHTER
a GUNSHOT

Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled
It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something
strong He regains control dumping the child into
Sashas arms

ARCHER
Hes not my son

SASHA
Yes he is --

Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting
shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest

second

Her wail of fear freezes Archer He looks back -- and
sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm
Archers face betrays his conflict A child -- but his
worst enemys child

BULLETS SHRED the WALL around Adam Getting closer
Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam
Just then -- a SWAT agent rappels in through one of the

shattered windows his weapon poised Archer kicks him
hard pitching him back through the window

Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body Thinking
fast he soaks his discarded T-shirt into a toppled
flower vase -- then places it over Adams face

Protecting him

He rushes to Sasha Together they barrel through the
soft paper wall and tear out an escape route

Still grappling Archer rips off the agents gas-mask

in the front door

EXPLODES up He rolls through a shower of glass -- but
comes up with Adam safely

Agents and thugs FIRE blindly upward and downward through

Livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out --

INT ROTUNDA - NIGHT

MAC-10 poised Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer

through the deserted rotunda -- BOOM BOOM His escorts
drop

Castor rushes down the staircase -- BLASTING at Archer
Unarmed Archer instantly disappears behind one of the
eight columns The columns are separated by mirrored-
panels

Cat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column
and mirror He spots Archer dead-ahead and BLASTS away

CRASH The MIRROR SHATTERS into a thousand pieces

ARCHER (0S)
Thats about a thousand years bad
luck

Castor whirls spots Archer again and FIRES Another
MIRROR Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and
FIRES again -- this time BLASTING away his OWN
REFLECTION

Then Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and
onto Castor They battle for control of the pistol

CASTOR
Its too late Jon Your kid
loves me And your wifes an
animal Even I cant keep up with
her

Theyre so close Castors whispering right in Archers
ear

CASTOR
Tonight Im going to make her come
like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate

your death

Castor licks Archers ear salaciously Enraged Archer
tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor

Hes got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly BULLETS SHRED
the world around him Archer staggers away as --

Loomis enters -- FIRING his M-16 as Archer dives for a
doorway Loomis FIRES the M-16s grenade launcher

BOOM The GRENADE EXPLODES -- the doorway bursts into
flames -- but Archer has made it through
Loomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off

angrily Castor cant follow through the flames

EXT ROOF - NIGHT

Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS
force him to take cover behind the cupola

Pollux FIRES at him from the other side
Archer RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back Stand-off

POLLUX
Remember me Your baby brother

Trying to get the drop Pollux carefully crawls onto the
top of the cupola

POLLUX
You tricked me into telling you
things I never told anyone

Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the
crown

POLLUX
Now take it to your grave

Archer FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and
SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Polluxs feet The cupola
disintegrates beneath his weight He plunges down

into --

ROTUNDA

Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the
floor at his feet

CASTOR
Pollux

Pollux is almost gone Castor looks up and sees --

ARCHER
Peering down into the rotunda

CASTOR

OPENS FIRE --

ARCHER

Ducks the bullets as he disappears

Castor desperately holds Pollux -- to no avail Pollux
slips away and dies He turns to Loomis
CASTOR
Get a medic -- now
LOOMIS
Forget him sir Its only Pollux
Troy

Castor snaps Without hesitation he jerks up his GUN
and PUTS a BULLET right in the middle of Loomiss
forehead

Castor looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated
as -- Buzz and Wanda arrive on the scene and see Loomiss
body

WANDA

CASTOR
What the fuck do you think

After Buzz and Wanda take off -- Castor gathers Pollux up
in his arms -- totally devastated

Authentic American Hero

He just pushes by her and goes into his office

INT FBI - ARCHERS OFFICE - DAY

Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and
Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred

Fury rising he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in
his clenching grip He hurls it into other Archer family
memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs

Only then does Castor notice Lazarro standing in the
doorway For how long -- he cant be sure

CASTOR
What is it

Lazarro shuts the door behind him

LAZARRO

We were friends once Jon so I
feel I owe it to you -- to tell
you face-to-face

(a beat)
I dont care how much hype youre
getting -- youre through After
that massacre last night Im
ordering a full inquiry into your

recent erratic -- and deeply
suspect -- behavior

CASTOR
Me -- erratic Victor what are

you talking about
Castor casually closes the blinds between the offices

LAZARRO

You start meeting with Brodie and
Miller Then they die
mysteriously Your best friend is
murdered -- and you dont seem to
give a shit
Suddenly youre smoking drinking
acting like a man with something
to hide

(beat)
Maybe youve been bought -- maybe
youve lost your mind But I

promise Im going to find out
Eye to eye Castor knows he cant finesse this one
CASTOR

Okay Vic I have a confession to
make But you arent gonna like
it

(wraps arm

around neck)
Im Castor Troy

LAZARRO
-- I dont understand

Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarros chest He
pleads for mercy as Castor pounds and pounds away at his
heart -- until it finally seizes up

Lazarro twitches in a death throe then slumps to the
ground

CASTOR
Now you understand

He punches up the intercom button

CASTOR
Cancel my four oclock
(beat)
And send for the paramedics
Victor Lazarros having a heart
attack

Castor fixes himself a shot of mescal He checks his

watch -- as if counting -- then kneels beside Lazarros
body

The door flies open -- and two medics rush in They see
Castor vigorously pumping Lazarros chest -- applying
CPR

The medics gently nudge Castor aside One medic takes
Lazarros pulse then shakes his head

Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store
He swings the trash can SMASH The stores WINDOW

Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned Then
several youths leap into the window and start pulling
merchandise out of the store

Mayhem as others join in clerks rush out to do battle

An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb A cop leaps
out and chases as the looters scatter

The driver stands at his door radio in hand Sensing
something he turns just as Archer grabs the canister
of Comply-Gas from the cops belt

Archer sprays him in the face The cop gags and sags
Archer quickly slips behind the wheel

Inside Archer hits a switch -- the cars tinted windows
darken automatically obscuring him from the outside He
HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away

RUNNING WATER

Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing
the bed He stops On top of the rumpled covers Eves
nightgown and a pair of Castors black briefs

Overwhelmed he sits down -- not noticing the water has
stopped Eve steps in from the bathroom

ARCHER
Eve
The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality
She runs but Archer grabs her She struggles --
fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her
mouth covered

ARCHER
Im not going to hurt you Just
dont scream okay
(no response)

Okay
Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her
EVE
I know you -- youre the one who

called Youre Castor Troy You

Archer holds onto her as she struggles again

federal prison as Castor Troy

Eve is startled by this intimate information but she
reveals nothing SIRENS approach the house the cops are
returning She keeps an eye on the door Playing for
time

EVE
How did he expect to do that

ARCHER
An FB1I surgeon gave me Castors
face He handled the transplant
the vocal implant everything
But somehow Castor came out of his
coma -- and killed everyone who
knew about the mission But not
before he was transformed into me
The back DOOR CLICKS open A voice booms out

COP (0S)
Dr Archer are you okay

ARCHER
If you need hard evidence get it
Your husbands blood type is O
negative Castors is AB

Archer glances at the balcony -- as FOOTSTEPS CLOMP up

the stairs Eve is about to answer -- or scream But
then
ARCHER
Remember the parachute dream Im

The blood drains from her face as Archer slips over

the balcony and disappears

Eve is at the computer -- dazed and disoriented She
snaps alert on hearing the front DOOR OPEN -- Castor is

tenses as he starts massaging her back

CASTOR
Youre all in knots Maybe

He studies Eve then grasps her firmly by the shoulders

CASTOR
You think Ive been acting
strange Like a completely
different person

EVE
-- Yes

CASTOR
Okay I have a confession to make
But you arent going to like it

Castor wraps his hands around her slender neck

CASTOR (contd)
I read your diary Ive been

trying to change -- trying to be

be

Eve reacts to the explanation There is a logic to it

CASTOR
And to prove it Im taking you
and Jamie away on a trip -- right

EVE

seizure right in my office It

ARCHER
I took a date out for chicken

her tooth on a pebble that got
into her three-bean salad
Somehow she and I had fun driving
around looking for an all-night
dentist

EXT BOATHOUSE YARD - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats
Silently checking his clip he discards the empty gun

Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths
Hearing a NOISE behind him --

BOOM Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair
hull He advances toward the boat gun ready when
Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step two
steps -- until --

Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps

The men collapse hard Castors pistol clatters across
the yard toward the docked boat

Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging
their fingers deep into their throats They throttle
each other so hard Archers larynx vocal chip is
dislodged

His VOICE CHANGES ECHOING with garbled STATIC
ARCHER
Give up Castor People are going

to find out

CASTOR
Not if I kill you first

They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from
the docked boat and picks it up Archer and Castor stop
dead in their tracks because --

Jamie appears holding the pistol

CASTOR
Give it here Jamie

ARCHER
No Jamie Dont do it

Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now
Both speaking in Archers true voice
And nobody is more confused than Jamie

ARCHER

CASTOR

Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled
CASTOR

chin

with sunbathers and yachters

pulling a barge

Castor forces Archer into its path At the last
moment

Archer leaps onto the bow of Castors boat as --
KA-BOOM Archers boat crashes into the BARGE which
EXPLODES

CASTOR

swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off

Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip
But the boat hits a wave

Castor loses the gun -- which skids away Archer slips
his head hanging over the side Castor tries to ram
Archer but he pulls himself up just in time

Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it WHUNK It sinks
into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around
his neck

CASTOR
You wont shoot me Jon Im

ARCHER
Okay I have a confession to
make but you arent gonna like

BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest He jerks and
reels -- dropping to his knees He looks at Archer in
total disbelief Then he sinks to the ground and lies
still

Exhausted Archer lets the empty gun drop Then he turns
and sees an FBI chopper heading his way Relieved he

turns back to Castor but -- Castors body is gone

Castor is crawling toward the flipped boats spinning

stabilizing screw Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the
leg He buckles but keeps going
Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to

bury his face on the spinning blade

CASTOR
Itll never be over Jon every
time you look in the mirror
youll see my face

They struggle as the propeller blade gets closer
closer -- slicing into Archers cheek At the last
instant

Archer reaches the anchor-chain He wraps it around the
screw -- stopping the whirling blades

Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer
moves

Archer takes Castors hand -- trying to tug off his
wedding ring Just when he almost has it off -- Castor
suddenly grabs Archers wrist and holds it tight

Eye contact between the two men Castor smirks his
grasp slackening as he finally fades away Archer
lets Castors hand drop then slides the ring on his own
finger

ANOTHER ANGLE

at the dining room table catching up on medical reports

Sensing something she looks up and sees a silhouette at
the front screen door -- a mans silhouette

ARCHER (0S)
Hello Eve

Pulse pounding Eve frantically pushes open the door to
glimpse the face of the man with Archers voice
Its Jon Archer Eve stares -- then touches his face
carefully tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar
Then she pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life

JAMIE (0S)
Dad

Jamie is there Archer smiles -- gently almost sadly --
with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could

never feel could never fake

She rushes to him The whole family hangs on hugging

and kissing -- for the first time ever really together
JAMIE
Im sorry I shot you Dad Am I
grounded

Archer smiles and holds her tighter But as they draw
Archer inside he hesitates

ARCHER
I have something to ask you -- to
ask both of you

He steps aside -- revealing Castors son
ARCHER
This is Adam He needs a place to
live just for a little while
Eve looks at Archer -- she sees what this means to him

and what the hell theres plenty of time now to talk

bathroom mirror Eve chokes back a scream

Archer turns and faces her -- with his true face He
sees her terrified expression turns back to the mirror
-- and sees his own face looking at him But he
understands

He embraces Eve holds her tight She responds happy
to have him home again We STAY ON his familiar smile

and

FADE OUT
