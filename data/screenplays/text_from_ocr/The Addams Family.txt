April 11 1991

THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11690

FADE IN

EXT ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE

A GROUP OF CAROLERS their eager faces upturned SINGS an
endless and cloying roundelay of Little Drummer Boy
They sing with self-righteous good cheer As they
pompously begin their umpteenth verse

THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past

the black wreath on the front door past broken windows
weather-beaten shingles a creaking shutter

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF

where the Addams Family members GOMEZ MORTICIA GRANNY
PUGSLEY WEDNESDAY and LURCH their faithful butler
gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING STEAMING PITCH
over the edge

AS THE CAULDRON TIPS THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE THE
BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN TITLES BEGIN

DISSOLVE TO

INT DIM HALLWAY - SEVEN OCLOCK AM

CU AN OVER-SIZED CUCKOO CLOCK --

The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY
HOUSE down to the creaking shutter It chimes the hour
In ONE WINDOW a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a
MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until shes almost off her feet
and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage
One two three mechanical kisses counting toward

seven oclock

IN ANOTHER WINDOW A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a
MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows up and
down

Meanwhile little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop
where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine
The front door of the house pops open and a MECHANICAL
LURCH appears and begins sweeping

Just then THING the disembodied hand with the
full-bodied personality CLIMBS into view over the back
of the clock

Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall

INT FESTERS ROOM A2

Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas
Even at this early hour he puffs on his trademark cigar
Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair At the moment

he radiates unfathomable woe

GOMEZ

Think of it Thing Hes been gone

for twenty-five years For twenty-

five years weve attempted to

contact Fester in the great

beyond
The room is a dusty cobweb-filled long-unoccupied shrine
to Gomezs lost brother Fester Gomez drifts in from the
doorway
The room has remained untouched since Festers
disappearance as a teenager The thick coating of dust
and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallions youth
- a football pennant from Alcatraz headless sports
trophies a high school photo with all the other students
keeping as much distance from Fester as possible
As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room

GOMEZ

And for twenty-five years
nothing Not a whisper not a
clue Im beginning to think my
my brother truly is lost

Gomez sighs Thing TUGS at his cuff pulling him towards
the

GOMEZ

(gazing at Morticia)

Look at her -- I would die for her
I would kill for her Either way
-- what bliss

Low-voiced incisive and subtle with Morticia smiles
are rare The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is
offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair
is spread like a diabolic halo A dark Garbo sultry
and remote shes a ruined beauty

Morticia OPENS HER EYES

GOMEZ

(adoringly)
Unhappy darling

MORTICIA

(passionately)
Oh yes yes Completely

Pugsley crouches on the floor playing with his kid-sized
chemistry set

The walls of his room are covered with road signs hes
collected -- Bridge Out Detour Excavation Ahead
Dangerous Undertow Keep Clear High Voltage
SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS still on their poles are stacked
in the corner

In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING

FISH TANK FILLED WITH PIRANHA

This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has
every chance of growing up to be the public monster his
parents would be proud of

He MIXES chemicals in a beaker The brew steams Grin-
ning wickedly Pugsley SWALLOWS it down

He contorts undergoing the beginnings of a transforma-
tion then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse Laughing he
crawls out of his human-size pajamas
