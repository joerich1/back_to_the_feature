“Be not afeard the isle is full of noises
Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not”

SLOW FADE IN

WARNER BROTHERS LOGO

comes into focus clouds drifting slowly behind it After a
moment the ‘WB’ disappears into the haze and WE SEE

EXT CITY SCAPE - MORNING
Manhattan the center of New York City Way way below US

An isle of regimented brick concrete and steel broken only
by a patch of lush green here and there Cars moving in tiny
rows down below For a moment there is nothing but surreal
beauty bliss and silence

And then WE drop

Hurtling down hundreds of feet per second toward the ground
just missing birds that SCREECH to get out of the way Tall
buildings passing now rushing glass And only as WE reach
ground level do WE come to a stop as the SOUND and movement
of the city overtakes US A city that for the moment is
being battered by rain

A YOUNG WOMAN moves past Fairly cute a touch heavy a mass
of dark curls This is ANNA GRAHAM 30s would-be actress
professional photocopy attendant and part-time ear piercer
pushing her way uptown through THE CROWD and fighting to stay
dry She is losing

ANNA
-oh damn I hate weather

She bobs along for a moment with a soaked copy of “Backstage”
held over her head then disappears into a building In her
hurry Anna doesn’t even notice the faint rainbow over the
Chrysler Building

INT ‘ALWAYS COPIES’ COPY CENTER - DAY

A sterile stretch of copy machines enlargers cheap computer
monitors etc AN AFTERNOON CROWD milling about

Anna hair still damp and sporting a multi-colored apron
stands at a cash register counting copies and punching
numbers A FEMALE STUDENT stands across from her watching

ANNA
(Scottish Dialect)
-SO sorry (TO STUDENT) It’s just
this bloody machine
STUDENT
(Scottish Dialect)
Not a problem Take your time

The student glances around then leans in toward Anna

STUDENT (cont‘d)

ANNA
‘Scuse me (TENSE) What

STUDENT

She holds a moment waiting to see if Anna can call up the
memory A LINE is forming

ANNA

ANNA

ANNA

The student glares at her then turns to the crowd

STUDENT
That’s fineI just want to know

She stares Anna down one last time then hurries off The
folks in line watch her go then slowly turn to Anna

ANNA
(normal voice)

Next

AN OLD WOMAN in line leans over to HER HUSBAND and WHISPERS
OLDER WOMAN
--actress
INT ‘ALWAYS COPIES’ COPY CENTER - BACK ROOM - LATER

A sort of employee’s loungestorage room A few chairs from a
previous decade and a battered counter top An ashtray

Anna with her feet up sipping a Coke and eating from a hag
of Doritos She is reading Miss Julie and CRYING softly

LARRY a pimply Assistant Manager of maybe 30 wanders past

LARRY
-that dude hates womenyou know

ANNA

EYES) Im doing a scene from it

LARRY

scene partner you gimme a jingle

ANNA

Thanks

EXT MANHATTAN - AFTERNOON - VARIOUS SHOTS

The city after lunch Taxis pounding down avenues PEOPLE
staggering back to work Puddles in the crosswalks

Anna wanders through a mid-town crowd heading south She

carries two big tote bags an empty birdcage on her back

She BUMPS into A BUSINESSWOMAN who gives her a dirty look
she stares her down with a silent “What” and a shrug

INT THEATER SPACE - SAME TIME

A small playing space at one end of a room Makeshift curtain
and a tangle of hanging lights A few rows of seats at the
other end A GROUP OF SPECTATORS watching some take notes

CLOSE ON the cage with a stuffed bird inside It rests in the
hands of Anna dressed in a 19th Century gown and heavily
made up She is performing her scene with A YOUNG MAN playing
‘Jean’ He wears a fake moustache and carries a stick

MISS JULIE
---no I wont leave it in strange
hands Id rather have you kill it
JEAN
Give the little beast here then and
Ill wring its neck

MISS JULIE
Dear little Serena (TO THE BIRD)
Must you die and leave me

JEAN
Don’t make a scene Come on now

‘Jean’ snatches the bird from the cage and accidentally drops
it A FEW SNICKERS from the class Anna is horrified by this

JEAN (cont’d)
You--(shit)--you should learn how
to kill chickens then you wouldnt
faint at a drop of blood

MISS JULIE
Kill me too Kill me Oh how can
you butcher an innocent creature
without so much as a quiver How
I loathe you I curse the hour I
first saw you I curse the hour I
was conceived in my mother’s womb

Anna has ended in a heap at the feet of her classmate After
a dramatic moment she stands and they hold hands A solemn
bow A SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE from the class

INT THEATER SPACE - AARONS OFFICE - LATER

A cramped office space in the back of the theatre Jammed
with memorabilia photos etc Mostly of A MAN smiling
broadly in a variety of roles Back when he had hair

The man is AARON SMITH handsome late 40s Now balding He
smiles across a desk at Anna--face still made up as ‘Julie’

AARON
---listen Im going to be blunt

ANNA
Okay umm

AARON
I don’t care what your peers said
It wasgood Honestly

ANNA
Thanks (BEAT) but
AARON
Look Anna you know what I’m going
to say You were you You weren’t
some poor Scandinavian aristocrat

good Anna Graham but still

ANNA
Oh (SIGHS) I see Again

AARON
Yes Anna I’m advising you to
switch career paths and Ill tell
you why

ANNA
»ahh alright

AARON
-you have a sweet face but by no
means ravishing And your body
look you could never be a leading
lady

ANNA
did I forget to make my payment
this month or something

AARON
Anna listen to me This is for
your own good and the good of the
group too People don’t like to
see other people fail

ANNA
I‘m not failing

AARON
Yes you are

ANNA
Its an acting seminar A seminar
You don‘t fail those

AARON
If anyone can its youyour
personality is too strong and you
seem unable to adopt a different
one Or even a variety of emotions
You are simply too much yourself

ANNA
ImI mimic people where I work
All the time nowI take on their
voice and mannerisms and stuff I
think it’s helping
AARON
Anna please hear what I’m saying
I like you you’re a nice person
Weve slept together I want you to
succeed But you wont you never
will Not at-actingI’ve taught
many people like you and they all
end up the same way

ANNA
Whatkilling themselves after
your pep talk

AARON
No in television and I don’t want
to see that happen to you

ANNA
I‘d love to do TV are you kidding
me

AARON
Yes I was actually

ANNA
Oh

AARON
I dont know what to tell you
Anna You would have to do things
I mean things SOQ radicalso
humiliating reallyto even start
to break away from who you are

ANNA
T could do that tf think be
radical Sure

AARON
Anna please This is not for you
it was time to tell you It was
You are genuine and true to a fault
--and that is precisely what works
against you in your acting

ANNA
--you mean I’m not a good enough
liar Is that it

AARON
Basically yes
INT THEATER SPACE - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - LATER

A musty elevator from another century essentially a wooden
cage that raises and lowers on a cable

Aaron and Anna riding downstairs together not speaking He
finally glances over at her Looks her up and down

AARON
--why are you still wearing that
get-up

ANNA

I’m humiliating myself (DEFENSIVE)
Whadda you care

Aaron is about to respond but stops Clears his throat

AARON
Listen not to seem insensitive
but there is one other matter that
Id like to discuss with you

ANNA
Okay

AARON
One of my students-you don’t know
her she’s in Mondays group-has
an unfortunate name It’s ethnic
I was wondering if you would mind
if I told her to change her name
to yours for career purposes

ANNA
What

AARON
Your name would be an amazing one
for an actress’Anna Graham’

Anna turns abruptly confronting Aaron

ANNA
I can’t believe thisI can’t
believe I keep coming here

AARON
It would really help her out
she’s a major talent

ANNA
You’re an ass you know that
AARON
Come on there’s no need for
that

ANNA

Yeah there is because you should
know it You are an asshole Aaron

The elevator lands Anna near tears yanks the gate up and
starts off Suddenly she turns around and walks up to Aaron
SMACKING him hard with one of her tote bags She then runs
off the birdcage CLANGING wildly about

AARON
(calling after her)
You do understand that she can take
it if she wants to since you don’t
have a SAG card I just thought as
a courtesy I would ask you first

EXT ‘EARS TO YOU’ JEWELRY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

Anna looking in the window of a pretty standard boutique for
jewelry ear piercing and accessories

Anna has been crying She glances at herself in the darkened
window of the business next door trying’ to smile--she looks
like Giulietta Masina at the end of Nights of Cabiria

ANNA
to herself)
“humiliating” huh Okay Fine

INT ‘EARS TO YOU’ JEWELRY STORE SAME TIME

Business as usual A GROUP OF WOMEN sit around waiting to be
waited on EMPLOYEES hard at work piercing putting out
stock etc

The bell at the front door JINGLES and people turn In walks
Anna still dressed from head to toe in her make-up and
costume but with a few flourishes The birdcage is tied to
her waist the bird itself rides like a plume in her fancy
piled-high hairdo and she staggers about using ‘Jean’s
stick as a cane And make-up-a lot of make-up

ANNA
sorry I’m late ladies (To
THE CUSTOMERS) Okay who’s next

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - 14TH STREET - NIGHT

A lonely section of grubby concrete offset by benches and
garbage cans TWO OR THREE PEOPLE down the way Floodlights
glaring down The only sign of life is a flutter of fabric in
the distance

The fabric belongs to Anna’s ill-fitting dress She is seated
on a bench near the stairs head in hand and feeling sorry
for herself After a moment TWO BUSINESS GUYS wander down
the stairs full of liquor and wanting a train Pronto It
doesn’t take them long to notice Anna

BUSINESS GUY
-hey look (LAUGHS) It’s that
one chick

BUSINESS GUY 2
Who

BUSINESS GUY
You idiot From Gunsmokethat bar-
tender lady

ANNA

BUSINESS GUY

BUSINESS GUY 2

ANNA

‘Miss Kitty’ actually

BUSINESS GUY 2

ANNA
Yea well talk to Marshall Dillon

BUSINESS GUY 2
What the hell’s with that outfit
anyway

BUSINESS GUY
The freak probably lives in the
tunnels down here

ANNA
I’m an actress asswipe

BUSINESS GUY
Oh God not that (CLUTCHING HIS
HEART) Anything but that

Anna starts to stand up to defend herself when a CRY FOR HELP
rings out

In the distance the flurry of A MAN being pulled off the
platform and into the tunnel by TWO HULKING FIGURES Another
SCREAM Anna and the business dudes look at one another

ANNA
Somebodys being attacked

BUSINESS GUY
Hey man you got your cell Call
the cops

BUSINESS GUY 2
Hold onI wanna see what happens

Anna doesn’t really think so much as leap into action She
rummages in her purse and produces a small bottle Pepper
spray She clutches this in one hand and her cane in the
other as she rises up and waddles off down the platform
Anna springs onto the tracks below

BUSINESS GUY 2 (contd)
Kitty get back here (TO HIS Co-
WORKER) Dude go help her

BUSINESS GUY
Screw her She’s the one with the
stick

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - SAME TIME

A MAN is huddled on his knees weathering kicks fists and
abuse from two tormentors WE can’t see his face

DAMON
O damn

Anna emerges from the shadows and CLEARS her throat Twice
Surprised the two male attackers look up and turn Only now
do WE fully see the man on his knees This is DAMON WETLEY
Indiscriminate age Clothes the color of pale skin

Anna looks at him taken aback by his beautiful haunted eyes
and strangely calm manner--especially in view of present
circumstances She CLEARS her throat again and speaks

ANNA
(softly to Damon)
Goshyou have wonderful eyes

DAMON
Thank you

One of the brutes smiles at this and looks down at Damon He
SMASHES Damon in the face after this comment Anna holds up
her spray

ANNA
Okay ummthis isn’t Mace It’s
worse It’s pepper juice and it
hurts

THUG 2
You want ‘er or should I

THUG
Uh-uh she’s mine

The first thug makes a lunge at Anna who brings her can of
pepper spray forward in a fluid move A jet of hot juice
jumps out and the man drops clutching at his eyes and
SCREAMING Anna stands over him as the second thug starts
toward her Damon reaches up and clutches at him which
catches Anna‘s attention enough to turn her around

She sprays wildly at him which causes the liquid to splash
on both the attacker and Damon Both men reach up to their
eyes and stagger back The assailant on the ground is now
grabbing blindly at Anna and manages to get a bit of her
dress in his hands Anna turns and uses her cane like a foil
WHACKING the man squarely several times until he falls back

The stick breaks during this last flourish but it is enough
The two men limp off down the tunnel CURSING and stumbling
away Anna turns immediately to Damon

ANNA
God Im soare you alright

DAMON
No no thank you I’m very
(TRIES TO STAND) I’m going to be
sick

He flashes a gorgeous smile up at her then vomits all over

the tracks Anna tries to be a good sport even when he does
1t a second time

ANNA
That’s okay that’s fineeeewww

INT ‘SUDS FOR DUDS’ LAUNDROMAT - LATER
A low-rent joint full of washers and dryers Harshly lit

CLOSE ON a bottle as Anna quickly works on getting the top
off She fights it even using her teeth Finally it comes
free and she moves to Damon who is curled up on a bench His
clothing is dirty and torn in places

ANNA
-here you go Try this (LAUGHS)
I feel a little like Jane Eyre

She splashes some water on his eyes and Damon immediately
lashes out WAILING at the pain

ANNA (cont’d)
Whats wrong (PULLING BACK) Hey
I tried to do a nice thing here
it’s just water

DAMON
Yes it’s just water I’m sorry
but I’m very sensitive to every
aspect of it and I need something
else With a better pH to it
ANNA
A what

DAMON
The pH balancewhat’ve you got
there I can’t see it but it must
beEvian

ANNA
Yeah I bought you the good kind
Its the most expensive

DAMON
Yes but the pH is very high It’s
toxic to someone like me

ANNA
Which raises a pretty good question
right therewho the hell are you

DAMON
Sorry rightDamon Wetley Nice
to meet you

ANNA
(British dialect)
Anna Graham Charmed I’m sure

She and Damon share a moment rather he reaches out touches

her breast by accident then finds her arm and pats it

DAMON
Sorry I wasare you English

ANNA
Yes I’mactually no I‘m not
It’s just a thing I do I sometimes
copy people it’s for my work Im

DAMON

(quietly)
-oh I see That

ANNA

DAMON
(nonplussed)
What accent

ANNA
Youre British right I mean

DAMON
No I just speak properly

Oh (STOPS HERSELF) It’s okay One
of those nights I guess

DAMON
Look could you get me something
with less alkalinity nothing over

ANNA
Right sorry your eyesyeah
Ill run back to the store

Anna grabs up her purse and move toward the door She stops

herself and heads back to her own pile of bags
ANNA (cont’d)
What’m I thinking Geez this is so
crazylook I have my own

Anna reaches into her large tote and produces a half-full
bottle of Volyic water She also pulls out a fencing epee

ANNA (cont‘d)
Here (SHOWING IT OFF) I forgot
I had a weapon See

(MORE )
ANNA (contd)
I do a little bit of fencing but
when I saw you I didn’t think I
just ran over (POINTS TO DRESS) I
Mean ‘hopped’

DAMON
‘Fencing’ (SMILING) Well that
helps explain the swordsmanship

Anna moves to Damon and gently sits scooping his head into

her lap She pours the water onto his eyes

DAMON (contd)
Ahhhhthat’s nice Thank you

ANNA
Did you know those guys

DAMON
Who The gentlemen in the subway

ANNA
Im not sure about the ‘gentlemen’
part but yeah them

DAMON
No afraid not I was just sitting

there on a bench and they came up
and grabbed me (REACHES HIS HAND

TO HERS) you’re dribbling

Anna has been studying the thin material of Damon’s clothing

Mostly the area around his crotch The material is very thin

She suddenly looks up embarrassed at being caught out

ANNA
Oh sorry (ADJUSTS WATER) Anyway
good thing I came along

DAMON
Yes It was quite good indeed
your saving me Thank you

ANNA
No problem Youd’ve done the same
for meright (WAITS) maybe

DAMON
Honestly I’m not sure (TOUCHING
HER ARM) What you did was quite
extraordinary Really it was

Anna smiles at him one of her patented ‘Anna’ smiles

And

when she smiles everything gets just a little brighter

EXT CITY STREET - LATER
At a corner down in Union Square Pretty quiet for New York

Damon and Anna stand under a street lamp not knowing what to
say Anna hands Damon a damp piece of paper the tears pour
down Damons cheeks He dabs at them from time to time

ANNA
You poor thingshould we go to an
emergency room Or the police

DAMON
I dont think so I’d like to go
home actuallyif you could just

Anna nods and walks to the street WHISTLES like a Teamster
A cab pulls up almost instantly

DAMON (cont ‘d)

giving me your phone number so I
can thank you properly

ANNA

No
DAMON

Oh Well thenI guess Ill
ANNA

I mean yesno I don’t mind

She pulls a marker out of her purse and looks for a stray
slip of paper Nothing She turns to Damon who shrugs Anna
suddenly reaches over and writes her number in fat numerals
across the taxi window The driver looks over annoyed

ANNA (cont’d)
Oh mind your own business

Damon climbs into the taxi then abruptly gets back out and
kisses Anna lightly on both cheeks

DAMON
(explaining)
sorry for my beldness but I
didn’t think I shouid shake your
hand in case I’m still contaminated
with your spray

ANNA
-that’s thoughtful

As an afterthought Damon adjusts the bird in Anna’s hair He
then slips back into the cab but rolls down the window

DAMON
Anna Grahamtell me something
before I go What is your greatest
wish That one above all others
that would make you happiest

ANNA
Umm well I’dhuh Lemme think
Ahh I need to be a better actor
It’s all I wish for in life Thats

Damon nods and SIGHS heavily He sits back and motions to THE
DRIVER Anna watches the cab leave and touches her cheek

CLOSE-UP - A YOUNG MAN

staring at US He is 30s sandy haired Well built He is
handsome in a way but carries great sadness in his eyes He
is earnestly talking with A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN His name
is STEM and only after a moment does it become obvious that
he is in a wheelchair

GO WIDER to see that he is on television part of a popular
medical drama Think ER in New York City

INT ‘GENTLE ARMS’ RETIREMENT HOME - LOBBY — MORNING

A spacious if somewhat antiquated apartment building for
seniors Thick pillars to the ceiling Overhead chandeliers

Anna enters from the street and into a vast room that makes

up the lounge Anna‘s parents run this place and Anna herself
is a familiar figure to the pensioners She moves past A FEW
OLDER PEOPLE who sit in tight little groups watching the TV

ANNA
-morning good morninghey

Anna smiles as she is nearly sideswiped by a FLASHING blade
That’s what I said the flashing blade of a sword Anna looks
over barely changing expressions

ANNA (contd)
Mom

B Backed up againWhoahh almost

Like a female Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone they go up the
stairs and down around a couch and between pillars Cutting
and parrying their way back to where they started

Suddenly Mrs Graham feints right moves left and Anna’s

foil shoots into the air CLATTERING LOUDLY on the ground
A SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE from the residents as Anna stands
pinned to an ornate glass wall by her mother’s blade

ANNA
Okay Mom you win Mom

MRS GRAHAM

nearby and staring out the window Drifting

EXT CENTRAL PARK - TIGER CAGE -— THE NEXT DAY

A blast of foliage in the heart of the city A zoo tucked
away from the angry throb of cars and noise The tiger cage
at lunchtime TOURISTS and EMPLOYEES lolling about

Anna stands patiently watching the big cats from a safe
distance She notices that the animals study her every move
now--mostly because of the sandwich she is eating She spots
the “Do Not Feed The Animals” sign but after looking around
throws a section of hoagie through the bars anyway

DAMON

that glitters Just like Dorothy’s slippers A note attached

A monkey CHATTERS nearby stopping Anna from replying

catches herself and walks off a bit Damon follows

over at the monkey cage and makes a face Damon smiles again

monkeys It’s cozy isn’t it I

DAMON
Yes Very (HANDS OVER A NOTE)

Anna smiles at him and walks over to watch the monkeys After

moment Damon follows From a distance they almost look
like a couple Almost

EXT CENTRAL PARK — LATER

A wooded corner of the park Anna can stand it no longer she
moves off the path and looks at her present Reads the note

DAMON
(voiceover)
Dear Anna Graham This is what you
must do to your old selfUse your
name to understand me(4 letter
word) Yours Damon

Anna is a bit confused she turns the ruby-colored box over
then opens it Empty

ANNA

Anagram (TO HERSELF) This is nuts
Let‘s see’red’ No ‘Scarlet’
uh-uh How about ‘ruby’ R-U-B-Y
B-u-r-y ‘Bury’ my old self

GO CLOSE to see inside the box Nothing Well just a sort of
hazy air Then slowly the tiniest of clouds--like a cotton
ball--rises up and out of the box It bobs gently in front of
Anna GO WIDER to see a dawning amazement on Anna’s face

INT “CUMULUS” RESTAURANT - THE NEXT NIGHT

A blaze of white various shades Tables chairs walls
Pretty upscale and teeming with CUSTOMERS

A WAITER is standing at a table in one corner He waits as
Damon intently studies two bottles of water

DAMON
-this should do nicely

Damon chooses one and the waiter leaves drawing a small blue
curtain closed with a flourish for complete privacy Anna has
been watching Damon clearly amused

ANNA
By the way I absolutely love my
gift I do And the puzzle was fun

DAMON
Well thank you

ANNA
Butwhat is it I mean it’s a

He pours some aqua into his glass holds it up to the light
for Anna to look at

DAMON (cont’d)
In fact the greatest actor in the
world is right here in front of us
You should watch ityou’1ll learn
a lot about your craft

ANNA
How is water the greatest actor

DAMON
It has the ability through its
influence for pronounced but
reversible change without ever
ceasing to be itself

ANNA
Oh Huh (BEAT) My acting teacher
says I’m too much myself

DAMON
Nonsense An actors secret weapon
is him or herselfand there’s no
one else like you Anna of that Im
certain

ANNA
--thanks (GRINS) Well maybe you
can give him a call then Explain
my elusive charms

DAMON
Happily Anyway I’m doing a lot
with it out at my house--water I
mean--experiments and such A few

Anna looks at Damon not sure whether this is the scientific
equivalent of ‘come up and see my etchings’ or not Damon
smiles but seems quite serious

ANNA
That’s umm you knowwhen

Well I know you’re busy So at
your convenience

ANNA
Okay AhhI mean I have next

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - ANNA‘S APARTMENT - LATER

GO WIDER to see Mr Graham stand and stretch as he throws a
screwdriver back into his tool box As he does he notices
a little ruby box on Anna’s counter

Mr Graham opens it and looks inside perplexed He pokes it
smells it Even licks it Appears to enjoy the taste After a
moment he reaches in and grabs the cloud popping it into
his mouth Swallows

Sound of KEYS in the lock Feeling guilty Mr Graham quickly
puts the lid on the box and goes back to cleaning up Anna
enters a moment later just getting back from her date

MR GRAHAM
-good evening sweetie
ANNA
Dadwhat’re you doing here It’s

MR GRAHAM
You asked me The oven

ANNA
Oh right right yes Ummm

MR GRAHAM

shrugs sheepishly

MR GRAHAM
---what can I do The woman hardly
- let’s me out of her sight

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - ANNA’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna yanks open the door to find Mrs Graham reading pill
bottles and generally searching through the medicine cabinet
Caught red-handed she doesn’t seem to mind

ANNA
---mom

Mrs Graham’s eyes narrow as she holds up a diaphragm

MRS GRAHAM
(whispering)
-and so what’s this then

ANNA
That is called a sensible womans
survival kit Or in my case a
museum relic Please get out

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS ANNA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Mr Graham is holding his stomach obviously the cloud has
not settled well with him Without warning the sound of a
FART Loud and throaty Anna sticks her head out the door

ANNA
»umm Dad can you save that for
the boiler room

MR GRAHAM
Sorry honeyit’s the pop-tarts

Anna pulls her head back inside to deal with her mother

The tiny cloud looking a bit worse for wear slowly floats
UP INTO FRAME Mr Graham mortified scoops it up and
returns it to the box just as his wife and daughter enter

Mr Graham snatches up his tools and grabs his wifes arm
before she can protest

MR GRAHAM (contd)
Ill get that piece and bring it
over another time honey Come on
mother time to go

They are gone Anna stands there unsure what just happened
After a moment she SNIFFS the air Goes to the sink and
grabs up some Glade aerosol Sprays

INT ‘LIQUID ANGEL’ DANCE CLUB - WEDNESDAY NIGRT

A riot of color and SOUND MUSIC BLARING from another place
PEOPLE moving in and out of this velvet room Off to one
side Damon and Anna standing at a small table Damon is
locked on her listening Anna SPEAKING over the MUSIC

ANNA
«So that’s why I want to act Not
really for the fame or the glamour
but for more noble and worthwhile
reasons (BEAT) Is that ok You’re
looking at me like I’m

DAMON
No of course Yes Such as

ANNA
Oh you knowmy fascination with

DAMON
‘Neat’

ANNA

Damon but it doesn’t speak to me
Doesn’t move me It’s not art

DAMON
Anna of course it is

ANNA
Sciehce can’t be art That would be
a contradiction in terms

DAMON
Yes well (FRUSTRATED) then
if it isn’t art it’s greater than
art

Damon burns a hole through Anna with his eyes Finally she
looks away

DAMON (contd)
--you sure you don’t act just so
people will notice you Hmm

ANNA
So is that what you do when you
lose an argument Insult people

DAMON

Answer the question please
ANNA

No I‘m net gonna (BEAT) Yeah

Damon nods and looks off into the crowd his head moving
slightly to the POUNDING MUSIC He looks back at Anna who
sips on her drink Fingers crawling toward her purse

DAMON
You don’t have to go yet do you

ANNA
No it’s okay But I do need to

INT ‘LIQUID ANGEL’ DANCE CLUB - LATER

An EXPLOSION of sound and movement PEOPLE dancing I mean
really going at it And at the center of it all Damon and
Anna

Anna is trying to keep up and she’s not bad but Damon rules
the floor Men women young old they are no match for this
cat He seems to float between them defying gravity moving
this way and that almost simultaneously After a while Anna
simply stops and watches Damon keeps darting in seemingly
about to kiss her hovering in front of her mouth Just as
Anna reaches out however he whisks himself away

Suddenly Anna has lost sight of him--in the throbbing crowd
she is starting to feel a bit claustrophobic And then like
a vision he appears Scoops her into his arms Moving hard
to the beat She tries to keep up but has to stop again He
SCREAMS at her to be heard above the music

DAMON
--SO

ANNA
What

DAMON
Am I an artist or not Well

ANNA
Yes you are Yes But I

DAMON
Yes what

ANNA
I needI think I should go It’s

No I canyou stay if you want

DAMON
But you‘re still coming out to my
home Please say ‘yes’

ANNA
--yes Yes Id love to

DAMON
Alright Thank you Sorry but I
find this noise very cleansing

Anna smiles and nods moving off She looks back once able
to catch only a glimpse of Damon as he bobs and weaves along

EXT CITY STREETS - LATE NIGHT - VARIOUS SHOTS

Anna walking back to work She moves along the main avenues
for the most part but she knows the city well enough to use
a few shortcuts Pretty light FOOT TRAFFIC due to the hour

Anna cuts down a dark street when she notices TWO FIGURES
standing near a construction site Anna doesn’t like the look
of this--their shadowy outlines against the light--and stops
for a second She is about to double back when one calls out

FIGURE
-hey Hold it a second

Anna despite herself swings around for a moment The two
men continue to move toward her in the dark Anna starts to
back away as they advance She turns and runs but is quickly
caught Rough hands bring her to the ground face down Her
skirt being pulled off Bag rummaged through

Anna tries to scream but rough fingers slip around her mouth
Pulling her back into the dirty work area through ribbons of
‘Caution’ tape CLOSE ON her face as her eyes widen trying
to focus

Suddenly she spots A MAN just crossing the other end of the
street The sound of HARD SHOES moving fast on pavement

MAN
Hey Hey you two

Anna bites into a thumb and rolls hard to one side as her
attacker falls over CURSING her She jumps up and runs smack
into the arms of NATHANIEL POWERS 30s dark hair clever
eyes Anna grabs him and SHOUTS

ANNA
Help me Please

NATHANIEL
Of course sure (PUSHING HER
AWAY) You go Hurryi

Anna breathing hard staggers toward the building opposite
Nathaniel’s eyes narrow as he disappears behind strips of
flapping plastic Anna leans against a brick wall watching
as a shadowy fight rages behind the translucent sheeting
Then

NATHANIEL (cont ‘d)
(offscreen)
Come here Yeah that’s right
you better run

CLOSE ON Anna as she waits nervously outside After a moment
the sound of FOOTSTEPS She looks timidly into the gloom to
see Nathaniel walking quickly back towards her He waves

ANNA
Are you alright

NATHANIEL
More thanI think it’s okay now

He reaches her a bit winded A bleeding lip He leans one
arm on Anna for support and hands over her purse

ANNA
Did you

NATHANIEL
Yes I hit one but they ran off I
think my menacing presence scared
them
37

Nathaniel smiles allowing Anna to catch the irony She does
but she seems a bit out of it She wanders around with her
skirt in her hands trying unsuccessfully to get it back on

ANNA
Thank God That’s the second time
this week that I’ve been

NATHANIEL
What (NOTICES) Can I help you with
that

Nathaniel bends down quite gentlemanly and holds the skirt
open so that Anna can step into it

ANNA
Oh thanks Umm I wasactually

those ‘crazy New Yorker’ stories

NATHANIEL
Thats fine I usually like those

ANNA
Hello Hi I’m Anna Graham

NATHANIEL

ready to go back that way Nathaniel smiles and points toward
the lighted avenue

nightgown and her diaphragm And her ruby-colored box
EXTINT DAMONS CAR NIGHT -— VARIOUS SHOTS

A Volvo 1800E cruises through Manhattan traffic darting
between other cars

Anna sits in the passenger seat stealing glances at Damon
He is dressed smartly in another version of his translucent
clothing this time with driving cap and gloves He SIGHS
DAMON
-I‘mso glad you could make it

And my clouds of course Trying
to alter their density

ANNA
Really Geez that’s interesting

DAMON
I can’t really Say any more than

Damon smiles that sad smile again and suddenly cuts sideways
through traffic SCREECHING tires and BLARING horns

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - EVENING

Hidden gates near a wooded road Hanging mist The thin blast
of lights coming as the gates begin to open Moments later
the Volvo darts through the opening the gates CLANG shut

EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - FRONT LAWN - SAME TIME

CLOSE ON Anna’s face as she steps out of the car Her eyes
move back and forth looking at something PULL BACK to see
that she is studying the sleek modern walls of Damons home

The entire place seems shrouded in a kind of beautiful misty
cloud bank Oh and snow Pure white snow Everywhere It is
a bit overpowering

ANNA
-umm did we drive to the Arctic

DAMON
(obviously pleased)
No of course not It’s all hand-
made (POINTS) I did it

ANNA
Yeah but it’s fake right I mean

A wall slides silently shut as Damon and Anna enter Damon
CLAPS his hands and several fluffy clouds slowly drop into
place and hover above the furniture No I’m serious Real
clouds Anna wanders around the room

Straight out of the last scene in 200i--or maybe a Magritte

painting The very modern mixed with the very baroque Huge

fireplace suits of armor Lots of marble and glass An out-
of-place blue vinyl couch

ANNA
--Sso Scientists make pretty good
money I guess

DAMON

No it isn‘t mine I mean it is
but I didn’t earn it It was my
inheritanceor what I bought

my parents died in a plane crash
Which may account for some of my
interest in keeping things aloft

ANNA
--I’m sorry (TRYING TO LIGHTEN
THINGS UP) Well Id love to see

Damon clears his throat at this looking away

DAMON
We didn’t ummit was just me

DAMON
Longer than that

ANNA
Okay Some other time then

DAMON
Yes Maybe so (CHANGING TOPICS)
Ahhhshall I show you around the
place or would you like to dig in
Ive had a nice buffet arranged for
us in the dining hall

Anna LAUGHS at this Damon doesn’t get it

ANNA
Great

DAMON
Did I say something funny

ANNA
No no not reallyI mean funny
to me but no I said something to
my mother about a ‘buffet’ tonight
and then lo and behold

DAMON
It should be quite good

ANNA
It’s not that it’sshe thinks I
eat too much Or something

DAMON
I see And do you

ANNA
WellI dunno What do you think

She twirls around in her Audrey Hepburn-knockoff dress and
Sweater and hopes for the best

DAMON
I think you look perfectlynice
Very substantial

ANNA
Oh Well thanks

DAMON
Sorry Im not too good atwhy
don’t I show you the place Well
get a bit of exercise so that your
mother’1ll be pleased and then we
can eat almost guilt-free

ANNA -
Sounds great

Anna walks over to Damon slipping an arm through his Damon
leads her toward a set of doors across the room snatching up
a translucent parka (with fur collar) off a nearby rack and
pulling it around Anna’s shoulders

Damon calls out “Open” and the doors magically do Just like
in the movies
EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE COURT YARD CONTINUOUS

Inside a massive compound with high walls Detailed topiary
fountains and the like All covered in a blanket of snow

Damon and Anna at the edge of a man-made pond whose water
isn’t frozen Swans nearby Light dancing off the surface

DAMON
-beautiful isn’t it

ANNA
Very Really Damon it’sso
but why winter I mean

DAMON
No that’s just it you seeit’s
not winter It’s just snow That’s
the beauty of it No windchill no
storms It’s got all of the wonder
none of the fuss

ANNA
But it feels like winter

DAMON
Yes but only here I can leave it
in an instant by driving outside my
gates So best of both worlds
(BEAT) Plus I think snow gets a
bad rap It’s simply misunderstood

Their eyes lock for a moment and thus begins the particular
silence that surrounds a first kiss Anna leans toward him
but Damon turns away

DAMON (cont‘d)
Let’s not spoil itnot yet

ANNA
Oh Umm I wasn’t trying toyou
know ‘spoil’ anything I just

DAMON
I know I understand

ANNA
-okay Whatever that means

Before it can get any more awkward the swans arrive-and
hover Just out of reach

DAMON
(pointing)
Would you like to be out there
wander amongst them

ANNA
I guess Yes theyre lovely

DAMON
Come on then Don’t be afraid

Damon steps cut onto the water and starts moving toward them
Uh-huh just what it says “onto” the water He walks across
the pond like Jesus in the middle of a parable

DAMON (cont’d)
Come on
ANNA
But theDamon you can’t do that
Its water

DAMON
No it’s not It just looks like
water But it’s better

ANNA
No it’sand why isn’t it frozen

DAMON
I made it It’s mine and Im
telling you that it’s alright
Trust me

Anna looks skeptically at him but decides to give it a try
She slips out of her high heels and barefooted is about to
walk out onto the pond At the last moment she chickens out

ANNA
How did you everI mean how is
it even possible to

DAMON
the trick is knowing where the
stones are

ANNA
Oh Ohh (BEAT) Wait is that true
or not

DAMON

if that makes it easier for you
to believe then it’s true

Anna is about to ask another question when Damon walks back
to her putting a finger softly to her lips With his other
hand he gently touches her face Anna smiles as Damon takes

her hand leading her back toward his house

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - GRAND DINING ROOM LATER

Damon sits on one side of a table Anna on the other They
are both scooping up dessert from their plates and stealing

glances at one another A glass grandfather clock chimes

‘midnight’ Clouds hang low overhead Roaring fire

ANNA
--hmmm If I were Cinderella I’d
have to leave now

DAMON
True enough And then Id have to
chase after you I suppose

ANNA
Hey don’t sound so excited

DAMON
No I just meantin the story

ANNA
Uh-uh that came later I think
The next day or something

DAMON
Really Didn’t the prince go and
find the slipper that night After
shed run off I mean

ANNA
Oh yeah rightforgot about that
part I guess he did do that

DAMON
See the men always get blamed for
thingseven when were trying to
save you damsels

ANNA
Yep Just your lot in life I
guess

DAMON

I suppose so (SERIOUS) II want
to help you Anna I really do

ANNA
Well you knowthat’s nice

She is about to continue when she notices a small PLOP that
lands in her custard Several more follow forcing her to put
a hand over her bowl

ANNA (cont’d)
-I think your cloud is dripping

DAMON
Sprinkling actually I assume it’s
the heat from the fire

ANNA
Right ‘Sprinkling’ (LOOKING UP)
And these are all foradmiring

DAMON
Yes Although they’re prototypes
for another thing Im creating

ANNA
And whats that (GUESSES) Is it
for the military or something

DAMON
Oh no I mean theyve given me a
grant but Im just leading them
on No this iswell just know
that it’s very important To me

ANNA
Huh Youre always so mysterious

DAMON
Not really No most of this is
just for funthe clouds snow
water All of it

Damon reaches up and gently pushes the cloud away It drifts
across Anna’s face completely obscuring her for a moment
then moves out into the vast emptiness of the room

DAMON (contd)
‘Mysterious’ is what I have going
on upstairswanna peek

ANNA
Ummm okaysure Why not

INT COUNTRY ESTATE — UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS - VARIOUS SHOTS

Damon leading Anna into various rooms down long corridors
etc WE SEE bedrooms sitting rooms a sewing room even a
glimpse of a laboratory of some kind

Damon and Anna hold hands as he leads her ever higher into
the reaches of his towering estate

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - UPPERMOST HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

A pale blue doorway stands at the end of a long passage
Damon steps aside and offers the honor to Anna She smiles
and pulls open the door

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna stands in the doorway staring at the rest of the room
Damon puts a hand on her shoulder and leads her forward Her
mouth falls open just a bit

PULL BACK to reveal Damon and Anna standing in front of an
exact replica of the monkey cage from the New York City Zoo
except that it has been built inside this room

It has the tree a tire swing a rope climb Everything The
sand has been replaced by beige carpeting but all else is
exact Large windows at one end reveal what again seems to be
the outside The gate to this strange ‘exhibit’ stands open

ANNA
-is this like a joke or what

Anna moves slowly away from Damon and goes to the entrance
looking cautiously around A huge grin on her face She looks
back at him then cranes her neck to look inside She is
about to step in when Damon charges her pushing her from
behind Instead of propelling her forward however she falls
to her knees and Damon tumbles over her Without a word Anna
suddenly gets the picture--this is for her--and struggles to
her feet She heads for the door but is slammed into it by a
quick-moving Damon He grabs her around the waist and pulls
her back toward the cage

Anna gives as good as she gets but Damon is just ultimately
stronger Finally he gets her to the doorway and tosses her
flailing body inside The door SLAMS shut just before she can
get to her feet Anna instantly throws herself against the
thick bars but it is no use She is trapped

ANNA (cont‘d)
--no No What’re you doing
No God Damon NO

Damon seems to instantly regret what he’s done--he hangs his
head and steps back Anna reaches out pleading with both of
her hands Damon looks at her sadly touches her fingers

Damon points toward a note pinned to the tree and silently
excuses himself Anna SCREAMS again but she is alone

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - UPPERMOST HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Damon leans against the pale blue door panting heavily He
takes a breath or two fighting to regain control The sound
of Anna SCREAMING can be faintly heard from behind the wall

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna chest still heaving looks madly about the cage She
goes toward the note but notices a bend at the back of the
space She hurries to it and looks cautiously around to her
surprise it reveals another thin passageway complete with
nightstand alarm clock steel mirror sink toilet and bed
A set cf handmade garments on the pillow Matching shoes
mittens hat scarf The works

There is also a bank of video monitors on one wall--old
black and white--that show various other rooms in the house
Anna quickly looks about but sees no cameras pointing at her

INSERT - VIDEO MONITORS

WE SEE a shadowy image of Damon cross to a TV Picks up a
tape and shoves it in the VCR Damon still shaking settles
himself down on a big bed and watches closely

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna watches Damon for a moment then goes back to the tree
and studies the note GO CLOSE to reveal Damon’s spidery
handwriting as WE HEAR

DAMON

(voice-over)
“Dear Anna Here are a hammer and a
bowling ball for your convenience
should you want to smash windows
I should warn you however that
they are both sound and bullet-
proof and that trying to break
them will only limit your enjoyment
of the view from then on”

Anna looks down at her feet and indeed there is a blue
bowling ball and a carpenters hammer She takes the hammer
and begins THRASHING it against the glass As promised it
only turns white in the places she makes contact Anna
returns and grabs up the bowling ball

She heaves it at the windows but it too only makes a variety
of smudge marks as it DROPS to the floor Over and over

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - DAMON’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Another odd cavernous room Dali by way of science geek
Damon still watching TV but becoming racked with fits and
tears it is too much He turns away crosses to a desk
Pulls a box out of a drawer Pen postcards Damon selects
one with a sunny picture of California turns it over Still
crying whenever he looks up he begins to scribble

®

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna bowling ball in hand has stopped and is listening to
the sound of WEEPING Uncertain she moves over to the bank
of video monitors and studies one in particular It is now

obvious to her that Damon is crying but she can’t make out
why FAMILIAR TV THEME MUSIC playing in the background

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

Anna sitting in the tire swing moving slowly back and forth
Her eyes never leave the pale blue door As if by magic or
sheer determination it slowly opens with a LOW CREAK

DAMON
it’s me

Damon steps quietly inside holding a tray of food Anna and
Damon are silent for a bit staring at one another

ANNA
(quietly)
Thank God

DAMON
Oh I thought you’d be angry

ANNA
Well don’t worry I am I am very
angry but I figured you were going
to come in with some sort of John
Wayne Gacy clown outfit on and I
was really gonna be in trouble

DAMON
That’s not very funny

ANNA
It is from where Im sittingnow
let me out of here Please

Damon tries a smile but it fades He starts to move forward
with the tray but thinks better of it he studies Anna

DAMON
I’1l make a deal with yougive me
the hammer and you can have food

Anna doesn’t move but one hand involuntarily shifts toward
her sweater She glances around

DAMON (cont’d)
No you’‘re not being videotaped
I just know you’re hiding it to
use on me Id do the same But
take the food it’s more important
You’11 still have the bowling ball

Anna bites her lip then reaches behind her back and removes
the hammer She tosses it through the bars Damon visibly
brightens and crosses to the cage placing the food on the
ground Anna scrambles to it and gobbles up the healthy
Sandwich fruit and water Damon sits and observes

DAMON (cont ‘d)
I thought making you wait to eat
might help you be moreopen
to my proposition

Anna looks up from slurping the juice out of the fruit bowl
That didn’t sound so good “proposition” Her eyes narrow

ANNA
what’s that mean

DAMON
Therewasn’t that tasty So
then weve already started

ANNA
‘Started’

DAMON
Weve begun My gift to youit’s
under way

ANNA
Damon look I don’tjust let me
go Let me out of here and Ill

DAMON
No I can’t- No Let’s not waste
time with that I’m resolute I
must do this For you

ANNA
What DO WHAT

DAMON
This (GESTURES) Do everything in
my power to make your wishes come
true Help youtransform

ANNA
But I’m a prisoner

DAMON
No you’re a chrysalis

ANNA
Damon I’m not a scientist What
the hell does that mean

DAMON
Its a butterfly Or at least
something turning into a butterfly
I’m repaying you by making you find
yourwingsas it were

ANNA
“Wings”

DAMON
Yes In a manner of speaking

ANNA
Yeah butaren’t you one of those
kids who grew up tearing the wings
off things

DAMON
Only sometimes And only so I could
see how those things worked

Damon nonchalantly gets to his feet stretching He crosses
to the tray and picks it up Anna suddenly jumps forward and
grabs hold of his leg and holds on for dear life

ANNA
Damon please don’t do this

He quickly pulls himself free and backs away

DAMON
Stop itnow you stop that
Listen to me this is what you
wanted and you’re going to have
it I am going to sacrifice my
happiness for yours

ANNA
What What did I want

DAMON
THIS I’m going to make you a great
actressno matter what (QUIETLY)
-I promise not to fail you Anna
No matter how I feel about you or
what it costs me personally

ANNA
Oh wellthat’s comforting

Damon opens the thick door and moves into the hallway He
stands in the shadows and CALLS back to her

DAMON
We start training tomorrow
INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - DAY
Anna in her new sweats seated on the tan carpet and staring

grimly ahead Damon sits on a chair across from her (inside
the cage) and rummaging through a clear plastic bag

ANNA
DamonI don’t understand I
thought you liked me

DAMON
I do like you That’s why I’m going
to make you happy

ANNA
Well I am not happy At all Im
disgusted I want you to let me out
of here right now

DAMON
No But I will give you a gift

A
How about some chocolate I need
sweets or Or some

DAMON
Uh-uh No sugar nothing unhealthy
No my gift to you is to take away
your freedom of choice for a while
Instead you’ll have freedom from
choice

ANNA
And the TV monitors Why those

DAMON
--I thought you’d be less lonely

Suddenly like some wild animal Anna flings herself on Damon
and tears at him Pulling his hair and clawing at his face
Damon pushes her away and reaches into his bag producing a
gun GO CLOSE to see that it resembles an orange plastic toy
but Damon trains it on Anna with determination

ANNA
(giggling)
Oooohhhhe’s got a gun

DAMON
Yes A water gun

Anna shudders and makes a mock-frightened face Without
warning Damon shoots her in the arm A half-inch sliver of
ice protrudes from her track suit

ANNA
Awww That stings

DAMON
I warned you

ANNA
No you didn’t

DAMON
Well I waved the thing at you
showed it to you That’s a warning

ANNA
Damon I’m hurt help me I’ve got
to go to a hospital

Damon doesn’t move to her but instead reaches in his bag and
tosses her cotton balls and a bottle of peroxide Bandages

DAMON
No you don’t Disinfect it and put
a band-aid on it

ANNA
You said it was a water gun you
liar

DAMON

Ice ig water (SHOOTS AGAIN) It
also has a ‘boiling’ feature

ANNA
Oww You deceitful asshole

DAMON
I was hoping I wouldnt have to use
it That’s why it was in the bag

He reaches into the case again this time pulling out a
translucent swimsuit

ANNA
What’s that

DAMON
For swimming After dinner And I
need to see your bodyto get a
picture of how much work it needs

ANNA
Its see-through

DAMON
No it isn’t It’s translucent

ANNA
I’m not a piece of meat

DAMON
Look youre the one who wants to
be an actor Bodies matter

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - POOL -— NIGHT

A lovely indoor pool with huge windows all around Like a
greenhouse but with water Clouds above of course Inside
Snow falling on the glass ceiling high overhead

Damon stands on the diving board (dressed in muscle-t swim
trunks and hat--all translucent) pointing his gun at Anna
She stands in her swimsuit slowly turning circles

DAMON
-okaythat’s enough

ANNA
What’s enough

DAMON
Turning We have to work on the
legswe could tone the arms a
little more Stomach’s in good
shape Comparatively speaking

ANNA
-thank you

DAMON
Buttocks need firming but that’ll
happen with the legs When you
stand straight your breasts look
as young as their age You’re lucky
as they should still be quite nice
after all this

Anna turns slowly toward Damon This has a bad ring to it

ANNA
“After” what

DAMON
After you do things Eat better
Exercise Become a more positive
person (SIGNALS WITH GUN) Okay
jump in

Anna is skeptical but does what she’s asked She drops into
the water and disappears to the bottom For a long time
Damon starts to worry kneeling down and peering in

Suddenly Anna erupts to the surface near his face waving

her arms madly It hasn’t been a trick she is drowning

ANNA
What the hell is going on What’s
wrong with this water

DAMON
It’s excellent exercisegreat for
your

ANNA

I CAN’T swim in it something’s the
matter with it

DAMON
It’s the opposite of my swan pond
This is highly diluted With air

ANNA
What’re you talking aboutwater
can’t be diluted

DAMON
Fine then call it aeration It’s
drenched with air thereby offering
less support to swimmers More work
is better exercise I call it my
‘Watair’

ANNA
Pleasehelp me

DAMON
Look youll feel better if you
accept the fact that you’re here
until we reach our goal

Anna struggles over to the far side of the pool paddling
madly like a dog’s first swim She clings to the lip

DAMON (contd)
Nowwhat other kinds of exercise
do you like

ANNA

None (THINKS) horseback riding
DAMON

Hmmm
ANNA

Dirt biking Snow skiing Any sort
of swift outdoor transportation
that takes me quickly away from
you

DAMON
Sorry

ANNA
And fencing You know that
DAMON
Yes but that’s risky Youd finish
me off in a second I saw you in
the subwayyou’re dangerous

Damon paces back and forth above Anna pointing a finger

DAMON (contd)
Keep treading water Oh I rented
us La Femme Nikita to watch later
I thought it might inspire you
it’s about a woman who gets trained
and improved

ANNA
yeah to kill people

DAMON
Still there are similarities

ANNA
Why didn’t you just rent My Fair
Lady That would satisfy all your
Pygmalion leanings

DAMON
Not a bad idea but Nikita’s more
modern A better role model -

ANNA
You’re crazy

DAMON
I am honestly doing this for you TI
like you a lot and yet I’m going
through with this in spite of it
(SHOOTS AGAIN) Now swim please

Anna swims away from the side and fights to keep herself

afloat She dips under a few times Damon wanders along the

edge keeping his gun pointed at Anna’s trembling body

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Anna curled up on the bed picking at healthy snacks Damon
sits away from her on the floor water gun in hand They are
both staring at a TV screen where La Femme Nikita is playing

At the moment Anne Parillaud is kicking the shit out of

Tcheky Karyo Anna glances cver at Damon who notices this

and scoots a bit further away In spite of herself Anna

smiles inwardly at this

After a moment Damon and Anna glance over at one another

again--they both look quickly away

INT ‘ALWAYS COPIES’ - EVEN LATER

Larry looks down at the card turning it over CLOSE ON the
card to see Nathaniel’s name on the blank line it reads a
friend” Larry looks up but he now stands alone Nathaniel
has disappeared

INT COUNTRY ESTATE THE ROOM —- DAYS LATER

Morning light spills in the bruised windows Anna tired and
hostile sitting up in the tree Damon leans against the door
with the gun in his pocket Both holding typewritten pages

ANNA
-this is idiotic I’m not going
to do this

DAMON
Yes you will Anna Yes

His hand slowly moves to his ‘water’ pistol

DAMON (cont ’‘d)
or else

ANNA
Butthe writing’s horrible No
offense but it’s melodramatic
crap Worse This makes Trauma
Central look like a masterpiece

DAMON
---why would you mention that Hmm

ANNA
Because I know you watch itIve
seen you on the monitors You even
watch the re-runs

DAMON
So And

ANNA
And it makes you cry Which is so
pathetic And baffling

DAMON
Dont you worry about that Just
read

ANNA

But this is

DAMON

Look I’ve studied a lot of acting
books for this different theories
and I have decided that we wont
follow anybody else’s notions
we’ll strike out on our own And
that’s why Ill write the scenes
for us Scenes for you to memorize
and perform Soshall we

Anna looks down at the paper scanning it She LAUGHS

ANNA
This is (CRIES OUT) Damon you
are wasting your time by keeping me
here You will never be able to
improve my acting I’m either going
to fail or succeed as an actress
it has NOTHING to do with you

DAMON
If I hadn’t come along ten years
from now you’d still be struggling

ANNA
Yeah well if I hadnt come along
you might be dead

DAMON
True But what’s more important is
that you would be a failure And
unhappy

ANNA
Oh yeah (LIKE A CHILD) Says you

Damon as if suddenly coming out of a trance stands and
looks around Then back to Anna

DAMON
“My Godhoney do you know who
that was that just walked by”

CLOSE ON Anna who stares at Damon like he’s possessed Then
slowly she realizes this is the beginning of the scene

ANNA
“ who”
DAMON
“Anna Graham”

ANNA
“The actress Are you sure”

DAMON
Yes she looked right at me”

ANNA
“Oh Wellwas she pretty”

DAMON
“Yes”

ANNA
“More than me”

DAMON
“Maybe slightlybut it’s not her
looks that make her so appealing as
an actress”

ANNA
“Right right it’s her amazing
personality Would you sleep with
her if you could”

DAMON
“I don’t know It depends on how
you feel about it”

ANNA
“You would want to sleep with
someone else I can’t believe it”

DAMON
“She’s not just someone else Shes
a great actress”

ANNA

“Which makes it more okay is that
what you think More excusable So
what I should be proud to have a

’ boyfriend who slept with Ms Anna
Graham What am I supposed to say
‘He was good enough for her so he
must be a good catch He must be
pretty damn great’ Is THAT it”

DAMON
“T don’t think things are working
out between us” (PAUSES FOR A

MOMENT) I’d say that was a very
good beginning

ANNA
That was the stupidest scene I’ve
ever heard Even porno movies dont
have dialogue that bad

DAMON
Yes truebut you were good

ANNA
I mean it was so ignorant and
the (STOPS THINKS) hey
I was good wasn’t I

CLOSE ON a tiny begrudging smile that Spreads across Anna’s
face It disappears quickly but it was there I promise

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Anna and Damon watching the monitors again--Anna sitting up
and forward as she studies Falconetti in Dryer’s version of
Joan D’Arc Anna is crying as she watches one fabulous close-—
up after another A nearby Damon silently holds up a tissue
for Anna who accepts it without looking away

INT ‘GENTLE ARMS’ RETIREMENT HOME - APARTMENT — LATER

THUNDEROUS POUNDING on the front door Mr Graham is watching
Trauma Central and eating a sandwich from a plate balanced on
his knees He has no intention of answering as Stem (on TV)
is having a crying jag sitting in his Porsche

Mrs Graham storms in from the hallway in a glorious paisley
housecoat

MRS GRAHAM
no thats alright you stay
there on your assI’ll get it

Mrs Graham pulls open the door and looks directly into the
eyes of a smiling Nathaniel Powers He bows slightly

NATHANIEL
The lovely Mrs Graham I imagine
MRS GRAHAM
You have imagined correctly And
you are
NATHANIEL

Im ahha friend of Anna’s

MRS GRAHAM
You don’t say

NATHANIEL

Actually I just did

Mr Graham looks up suspiciously and cranes his neck He
rises out of his chair

MR GRAHAM
Hey-you’re not Damien are you
NATHANIEL
“Damien”
MR GRAHAM

You heard me

NATHANIEL
No sir the name’s Nathaniel
Nathaniel Powers I’m a friend
and more

One of his cards appears from nowhere Mrs Graham APPLAUDS
the display of magic Mr Graham takes it and examines it

MR GRAHAM
Youre a detective

NATHANIEL
After a matter of speaking

MR GRAHAM
Whats that mean

NATHANIEL
It means I’m not a paid employee of
this city but I’m looking for your
daughter nonetheless

MRS GRAHAM
Ohhhhyou must be the other one

A smile spreads on Nathaniel’s face A kind of smile anyway

NATHANIEL
That’s right I’m the other one

MRS GRAHAM
Good for you Or should I say
good for her (MOVES OFF) I’1l get
you the postcards she’s sent us
Have a look

MR GRAHAM
Honey those are private

MRS GRAHAM
Oh hush up and watch your show

Mrs Graham moves into a kitchen area and starts removing
cards from the side of a fridge Mr Graham eyes Nathaniel
then turns back to watch the show Nathaniel follows his gaze
and locks on the TV As if hypnotized he steps forward

MR GRAHAM

You enjoy Trauma Central
NATHANIEL

Oh yes Very muchvery much

indeed

Nathaniel stares at the screen although his eyes drift to a
place above the television--several pictures of a young Anna
grace an overstuffed shelf GO CLOSE to see her smiling face

MONTAGE BEGINS

EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE COURT YARD - ANOTHER DAY

In the center of the courtyard is Anna trudging in endless
circles through waist-deep snow--she is wearing a harness
that is tethered to a metal pole A cloud follows after her
pouring down snow on only her as she MUTTERS her way through
a series of vocal exercises

- ANNA
Brum-mummum brum-mum-mum ha-
humbrum-mum-mumha-hum Ha-ha-
hum

During her many rotations Anna notices something very
interesting in the distance The SOUND of cars passing

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - SLEEPING ANNEX -— NIGHT

Anna yawning as she works to decode another one of Damon’s
anagrams She studies a bowl of strawberries and the little
pink note A stack of similar pink notes in a nearby bowl

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE LAB - ANOTHER DAY

Damon is busying himself in his lab which is a mix of high
tech and deep Gothic Frank Gehry meets Victor Frankenstein

Damon like a caring father moves it to a glass storage unit
and coaxes a nice thick cloud out into the room It is about
twice the size of a man Damon holds it in place then walks
up a short step ladder

Damon dives into the middle of the thing and miraculously
doesn’t fall through Instead the cloud swallows him up like
a pair of misty hip waders

He floats about the room for a bit bumping into shelves and
dodging around pipes Suddenly he pulls a syringe from his
pocket and raises it above his head Like mighty Ahab he
plunges in his tiny harpoon and extracts some ooze the cloud
reacts and begins bucking like a rodeo animal

INSERT - VIDEO MONITOR

A hazy image of Damon floating around on his cloud hanging
on for dear life He passes near the camera

EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - POOL - ANOTHER DAY

Anna standing frozen on the diving board--eyes wide open and
staring straight ahead WE SEE that she is more fit now and
quite able to manoeuver effectively Damon watches from a
nearby lifeguard chair SHOUTING orders with a bullhorn Each
time Damon does Anna instantly stops and adopts an emotional
pose--a kind of acting exercise that recalls ‘freeze tag’

DAMON
--do ‘content’ Do ‘stoic’ Now do
‘pensive’ Come on really do it
sell it Do ‘tragic’ Do ‘bold’

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - SLEEPING ANNEX - NIGHT

Damon and Anna lying next to one another on the bed Not
talking not touching Just together He has the gun by his
side but it is not threatening They are even sharing a plate
of carrot sticks CLOSE ON fingers touching Lingering

On each of the video screens VARIOUS FILMS are being played
simultaneously All scenes of strong women acting their
little hearts out All About Eve Sophie’s Choice Klute
Diary of a Chambermaid My Fair Lady Damon and Anna watch
the pictures in silence eyes jumping back and forth between
each screen--Anna mouthing the dialogue quietly to herself
skipping back and forth from scene to scene

MONTAGE ENDS

INT WAIST WATCHERS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

A small old-fashioned auditorium--maybe six rows of seats

inspirational speech Large charts dangling behind him A
RAPT AUDIENCE (mostiy women) fill the seats

(DOES A LITTLE TWIRL) If you like
what you see then give us a chance
to bring you back to the land of

Nathaniel does a little bow to the OVERWHELMING APPLAUSE
Many of the listeners make their way down to SEVERAL SALES
ASSOCIATES who wait for them at a nearby table

Nathaniel starts off toward a side door when a hand falls on
his arm-he turns to find Mrs Graham smiling over at him

NATHANIEL (cont‘d)
Well hello there

MRS GRAHAM
Good evening I must say that was
very impressive Quite impassioned

NATHANIEL

MRS GRAHAM

She pulls a postcard out of her clutch purse GO CLOSE to see
that it says “WELCOME TO SUNNY CALIFORNIA” A picture of the
sun wearing Ray-Bans and smiling down on a sandy beach

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - DAMON’S BEDROOM - ANOTHER EVENING

CLOSE ON Damon tears flowing sure enough WE SEE that he is
indeed watching Trauma Central After a moment he reaches
over to a night table and picks up a syringe He rolls up one
sleeve and sinks the needle into a vein Almost instantly
Damon appears to float a few inches above the mattress
That’s right ‘above’ It’s true Damon then reaches down
injects some more He rises up maybe a foot this time

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE ROOM - SAME TIME

Snow drifting down outside It’s getting late in the day
Anna is lying on her bed staring over at a huge bouquet of
roses and studying a little pink note GO CLOSE to reveal

DAMON

(voice-over)
Dear Anna Graham I hope that these
are not too unbearableI’m sorry to
be giving them to youBut with them

name to understand me(5-letter
word)Yours Damon

She looks at the flowers again then back at the note

ANNA
Another one of thesewell okay

SUPERTITLE THREE MONTHS LATER

INT COUNTRY ESTATE THE ROOM - NIGHT

Anna enraged throwing a handful of the little pink notes at
Damon They flutter to the ground

ANNA
-I have had it with this SHIT

DAMON

‘ puzzles Sick of it You HEAR me

DAMON

DAMON
Stop that just stop yelling I

(MORE )

DAMON (contd)
(POINTS WITH GUN) Go look at

yourself Anna do it look in the
mirror

She is ready to attack but turns on her heel and disappears

CLOSE ON the metal mirror Anna leans forward really trying
to take herself in Turns around looks over her shoulder
Looks again After a moment she returns

ANNA
Yeahso

DAMON
Your face Your figureI mean
the clothes I gave you are almost
hanging off you

ANNA
So

DAMON
So It’s working You’re becoming
a better ‘you’

ANNA
I don’t wanna be me remember

- DAMON
The more you like yourself the less
youll need to be someone else

ANNA
This is bullshitall that was my
problem to begin with ©

DAMON
You know what I mean And you are a
much finer actress now you know
that You do

Anna throws herself down on the carpet Damon CLAPS twice
and instinctively Anna starts doing lady push-ups

ANNA
‘II don’t think it’s going to be
enough to just escape any more No
I need to kill you Make you suffer
first but actually kill you

DAMON
Don’t talk like that Please Anna
I really deeply care for you

ANNA
If you cared for me youd release
me Simple as that

DAMON
No it’s not It isn’t because

ANNA
Remember the poem “If you love
something set it free” or what-
ever You’d do that if I meant so
damn much to you

DAMON
Thats not a po-em it’s a song
by that fellow from The Police

ANNA
Sting Jesus his name is Sting
And where do you think he got the
idea huh From the poem Po-em

DAMON
Quit talking and exercise

ANNA
Yeah well all I know is that if
you love something you see to its
needs first

DAMON
---who says I love you

ANNA
Oh come on you know you do

DAMON
No I don’t

ANNA
Yes you doyou totally do

DAMON
You probably love meyou have
Stockholm syndrome or something

ANNA

ANNA
Yes you do you do too

DAMON
No no NO

ANNA
-uh-huhlove-love-love”Love
soft as an easy chair love fresh
as the morning air”

DAMON
STOP STOP IT

Damon has now SCREAMED louder than ever before and it scares
both of them Complete silence THEME MUSIC from Trauma
Central comes in over the video speakers in the next room

ANNA
uh-oh it’s time for your little
showtime for Damon to have his
itsy bitsy cry Waaah WAAAHHH

Damon shoots Anna squarely in the shoulder She falls back
and clutches her arm He stands up unlocks the cell door and
walks out He turns back suddenly Abruptly

DAMON
And if I did love you Anna so
what What business would that be
of yours

Damon SLAMS out of the room The pale blue door SHUDDERS on
its hinges Anna is so stunned by this revelation that it
takes her a good minute or two to realize Damon has left the
cell door wide open I mean WIDE open As in unlocked

Like a death row inmate Anna creeps forward Looking around
She can’t believe it She tiptoes out of the cage and into
the rest of the room The wound is completely forgotten

Anna tests the door and it swings open CREAKS a bit Without
any more hesitation she takes off down the hall like a track
star on steroids Lots of steroids BOOM

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS - VARIOUS SHOTS

Anna THUNDERING along corridors getting lost doubling back
moving down staircases She’s not sure where she’s going but
she sure’as hell is not turning back

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - DAMON’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Damon lounging on his bed about to inject himself with a
Syringe and watching TV (Stem SPEAKS passicnately to a TEAM
OF DOCTORS) The tears have already started when Damon looks
up cocking an ear to one side A SOUND begins to build
outside crescendos then passes Like a herd of bison on
holiday CLOSE ON Damons face as he thinks Realizes

Damon drops the syringe and is up and running He is barefoot
and his shirt is open but he moves like a man possessed He
probably is actually At least a bit

INT COUNTRY ESTATE - GRAND HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Anna running about the room clawing at the walls and trying
to find a way out Clouds overhead They start to THUNDER and
flash lightening when a CLAPPING sound is heard Rain falls

Anna turns to see the source It is Damon standing in the
hall He is serious and getting drenched So is she

DAMON

--Annacome back upstairs Now
ANNA

Never
DAMON

Anna I said (RAISES HIS HAND)
I said ‘now’

ANNA
You forgot your gun

DAMON
So I didso I did

ANNA
Well well

DAMON
Choose your weapon then

Anna looks frantically around as Damon starts to advance on
her CLOSE ON a suit of armor in a far corner Anna jumps
over the vinyl couch and makes for it but Damon cuts her off

She doubles back and grabs up a long metal candlestick holder
as Damon reaches her

Anna LASHES out at Damons head He barely ducks in time

ANNA
Damon Im leaving this house Now

DAMON
I can’t let you do that

ANNA
Then stop me

Damon’s eyes narrow and he grabs down an axe froma nearby
wall The combatants square off Lightening and THUNDER Rain
pours down making the polished marble floor treacherous
79

Damon makes the first move but it is the attack of a zealous
untrained amateur He moves too quickly and slips swinging
his weapon wildly Anna easily sidesteps the attack and
catches Damon across the neck with her weapon Blood appears

DAMON
oO damn

Anna smiles and backs slowly away She keeps one eye on her
foe and one on the lookout for an escape route Damon
approaches again this time running at her and hacking madly
in several directions Anna meets him easily defending
herself The weapons CLANG loudly throughout the room The
rain falls Flashes of lightening THUNDER Damon swings
Anna parries Anna cuts Damon he retreats Again and again

ANNA
Enough

DAMON
-never

The battle is nearing its climax Anna moving slower now but
still grimly determined to fight her way out of here Damon
looks the worse for wear he is cut and bruised in a variety
of places but he struggles to hold on

Anna is feeling the wall with one hand looking for a latch
or spring lock Finally beneath a picture frame she finds
one The wall slides open with a POP Damon really nervous
now makes a last ditch attack

Damon jumps over the vinyl couch and comes down fighting
He catches Anna’s outfit and slices a hole in it but she
parries quickly and knocks Damons axe from his hand They
stare at one another Anna is breathing heavily Damon
fighting for air Huge gulps

Damon smiles sadly at Anna--a frozen moment--then dives for
the floor Anna brings her candlestick holder down quickly
smacking Damon across the back of the head Damon drops to

his knees then passes out Anna starts to move to him but

turns and runs off instead out through the front doors

EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

Anna dashes down the front steps past the Volvo and down the
gravel path In her desperation she loses one clear shoe but
doesn’t go back for it Anna disappears into the woods at the
front of the property never letting go of her weapon

The SOUNDS of nature for a moment Quiet Serene Only the
tracks she has left in the snow betray Anna’s escape

EXT NEW YORK SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

The dawn is mounting its push over the buildings and canyons
of the city The NYC equivalent of a rooster crowing--the
sound of TRAFFIC HORNS and HELICOPTERS overhead

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - ANNAS APARTMENT - MORNING

The front door CREAKS open Out of habit Anna replaces her
extra key in its hiding place and then enters the room

She falls down on her bed and listens to herself breathe In
and out Anna then picks up her phone GO CLOSE to see her
dial 911 then abruptly hang up She dials again Slowly

DAMON

(offscreen)
-hello Hello Is any one there
(BEAT) Anna Anna is that you

Anna quickly hangs up DIAL TONE Anna replaces the receiver
and falls back on her pillow She is trying to keep from
becoming hysterical It takes some work

INT ‘GENTLE ARMS’ RETIREMENT HOME - APARTMENT - DAY

-are you happy Anna

Anna is frozen doesn’t know what to think A flood of

along toward home Wandering A car pulls up slows Anna

Anna glances around frozen in her tracks She can’t decide
whether to scream again call the police or climb inside

ANNA
I hate you I think

DAMON
Yes well there was always the
danger of that

ANNA
Right

DAMON
I fell in love and you fell in

They stare at one another unsure what to say A CAR HORN
from behind forces them to act

in With me

ANNA
And be your prisoner again Fat

EXT CENTRAL PARK - CASTLE ON THE HILL -— NIGHT

Overlooking the park Nothing but trees with buildings in
the distance The moon out and shining down

Damon and Anna sitting on the wall of the castle looking
down toward the Delacourt Theatre Damon dangles his feet
over the edge--he is wearing a pair of over-size leather

and metal boots Imagine early astrconaut Very early

DAMON
-Il swear to God it’s true

Anna staring at him incredulous She doesn’t know what to
say but that rarely stops her

ANNA
He wasmaimed Maimed

DAMON
Yes By his business partner Ben
A brilliant surgeon but hopelessly
insane A God-complex times nine

ANNA
And he what I’m a little lost

DAMON
They had a clinic together Every-
thing seemed normal on the surface
but Phillip found out that Ben was
doing experiments on his own at
night Perfecting his techniques on
people whom he was kidnapping off
the streets

ANNA
You’re joking

DAMON
Nosnatching them right out of
their neighborhoods like something
from that movie M

Anna shudders at this Damon cautiously puts an arm around
her but she shakes it off

ANNA
Dont do thatonly reason I can
even be near you is because we’re
in public Outside

DAMON
I understand

She scoots further away and reaches into her purse pulling
out the water gun Points it at Damon He smiles sadly Nods

DAMON (contd)
--hmm I wondered where that was

ANNA
Then what happened To Phillip

DAMON
I turned Ben in Phillip made him
promise to stop but when he told me
about it what this man was doing--
I mean attacking innocent people
bastardizing science--well I had
to do something Unfortunately he
thought Phillip was the informer

ANNA
--and he paralyzed him

DAMON
Yes After killing Phillip’s wife
In front of him (BEAT) He told my
brother that taking those things
which are most precious to a person
are the cruelest cut of alland
therefore what he enjoyed most

ANNA
My God

DAMON

No God was nowhere to be found I
found Phillip in his home almost
dead and his legs rendered useless
but you know He never let on that
it was mehe didn’t The police
tried to find Ben but he was gone
Vanished

ANNA
-that’s unbelievable

DAMON
Yes like something off his show
“Ripped from tomorrows headlines’

ANNA
Exactly Theyd probably reject it
too fantastical

DAMON
- I suppose And yet it all happened
You can ask Phillip if you like

ANNA
--no No I think I believe you

Anna scoots over and allows Damon to put an arm around her
Even puts the gun away

ANNA (contd)
Do you two ever speak I know you
watch the show but

DAMON

Never Itd be too painful for him
that’s what he told me No the
only way he could live with it was
to forget Forget about me about
himselfto lose himself In his
acting (BEAT) And I learned to
lose myself in guilt And regret

ANNA
God I mean that’s so

DAMON
--yes (STARTS TO CRY) Ialways
thought that if perhaps somehow
through my work I could help him
get out of that chair then maybe
he mightforgive me

ANNA
I see And me
DAMON
YouAnna just happened Out of

the blue

EXT CENTRAL PARK - SOFTBALL FIELDS - LATER

Damon and Anna walking along holding hands Actually she
walks and he CLOMPS Anna glances down at Damon’s boots

ANNA
hey what’s up with those Are
they for exercise

DAMON
(elusive)
No theyre fornothing My work
It’s complicated

Damon is about to let it go when he realizes this tactic no
longer works with Anna she is visibly cooled by his remarks

DAMON (contd)
--wait no youre right Yes
Anna I want to show you something

ANNA
What

DAMON
This

He reaches down and begins to unfasten the rather elaborate
contraptions on his feet
DAMON (cont’d)
Clouds were easybut this this
was tricky

After a moment Damon is free of his footwear and almost
instantly he floats up from them and slowly OUT OF FRAME
Anna looks up incredulous

DAMON (cont’d)
(offscreen)
I worked from the outside in
found out what makes a cloud tick
Then put that inside the body

ANNA
(looking around)
Damoncome down here

DAMON
I cant I mean not so easily
it takes a while I’m still working
on getting the dosage just right
It’s incredibly complicated since
it reacts differently with every
personmili parts per thousand
and all that

Almost like swimming Damon cuts through the air around Anna
moving this way and that Like a ballet dancer in jello He
reaches into a coat pocket and produces a thin syringe GO
CLOSE to see it filled with a bubbling white serum

DAMON (contd)
Try it with me Anna please

ANNA
Whatre you crazy I’m not gonna
let you shoot me up with some

DAMON
Anna it’s amazing

ANNA
Fine it’s amazing Great

DAMON
Ccome onpleasebe with me

Anna starts to speak looks around then holds out her arm
ANNA

»oh go on then Before I wake
up and come to my senses

Damon smiles and ‘swims’ down to her He holds on to her arm
and draws the syringe near CLOSE to see the needle prick
Anna’s skin

It takes a moment Still nothing Then suddenly Anna also
rises up OUT OF FRAME Her face lights up as she lifts off
GO WIDER to see she and Damon arm in arm floating off above
the trees of Central Park lit only by moonlight Soaring
along now they begin to kiss I mean really kiss Like
something out of a Brassai photograph Only lighter

EXT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - ANNAS APARTMENT - LATER

GO CLOSE to see a trail of clothing leading to Anna’s bed
Follow it along to find rumpled sheets but no one in it
Instead WE SEE that the blankets are hanging down from
above Yes that’s right

A naked Anna and Damon hidden by a comforter that dangles
down are lying in each other’s arms Content Post coital
And floating high above the floor

DAMON
(whispering)
we have to be careful Too much
and we’ll stop being clouds Well
justrainuntil we die

ANNA
(whispering)
-thanks for warning me

After a moment they begin to make love again and WE LEAVE
THEM to look out Anna’s window at the glorious skyline of
Manhattan with the moon shining down Still one of the best
sights on the planet

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - ANNA’S APARTMENT - DAWN

The sun is just starting to peek in the window Anna and
Damon lying together in the bed Both asleep TV still on
Wyler’s The Collector is playing

A GENTLE KNOCK at the door No answer ANOTHER then the
RATTLING of keys in the lock The door swings open

MR GRAHAM
-Anna I got that thermostat and
thought I’d get a jump onHoney

Damon looks up first meeting Mr Graham’s gaze Damon tries
to wake and smile at the same time Waves at him

DAMON
Umm good morningMr Graham I
presume I’m DamonAnna’s friend

MR GRAHAM
(whispering)
DamienDa-mi-en

Mr Graham drops his toolbox with a CRASH and runs off
SCREAMING Damon’s name down the hall Anna sits up

ANNA
-what was that

DAMON
I think I met your father

Anna clears her head and jumps up thinking She gathers her
clothing and motions to a befuddled Damon

ANNA

We gotta get out of here Now
DAMON

But
ANNA

Damon youre my kidnapper -That’11
be a little hard to explain to my
folks

Damon nods and gets to his feet swiftly slipping on his
translucent pants over his translucent boxers
EXT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - FRONT STEPS - CONTINUOUS

Anna and Damon in a hurry moving down a flight of steps
They are almost in the clear when

MRS GRAHAM
-hold it right there missy

Anna looks up to see her mother outfitted in full fencing
gear standing on the sidewalk Blocking their way

ANNA
Mom I don’t wanna fight you but I
will

DAMON

Mrs Graham we can explain

MRS GRAHAM
Shut up you Just shut itmy own
daughter harboring a criminal

ANNA
Mother we are leaving right now

MRS GRAHAM
You can’t take me girl and you

called and so has your boyfriend
All I need to do is detain you

DAMON
Anna maybe we should just

ANNA
No Damon No This has been coming
for a long time

Anna throws her overnight bag down withdrawing her foil from
it as it drops She squares off with her mom the two women
slowly circling one another Mrs Graham drops her visor

MRS GRAHAM
Youve never done what youre told
Never And now youre gonna pay

ANNA
Says you

Mr Graham approaches from further up the street and spots
Damon both men seem to know to stay out of the way This is
going to be a cat fight

CLANG The ladies meet head on running toward each other and
slicing the air Cut and thrust parry and jab Across the
Sidewalk over trash cans up and down the block When they
are close together elbows and knees are used Hair is
pulled A head butt or two It isn’t pretty

MRS GRAHAM
Youre soft you’ve always been
soft A disappointment

ANNA
You are a hard hard woman You
never loved me

Mrs Graham pins Anna against a wall but she manages to dive
out of the way roll across the cement and scoop up her
blade Off they go again Slowly the sound of SIRENS
Mrs Graham smiles Only minutes left now She lunges at
Anna who blocks her move and thrusts at her mother with all
her might Bingo A direct hit one that slashes the purple
arm of her pantsuit Mrs Graham SCREAMS with rage and then
charges forward grabbing Anna and tearing at her Anna
smacks her mother across the head with the hand guard on her
foil knocking the older woman back over a car fender She
rolls to a stop at the feet of her husband

Anna looks over at her father shrugs Turns to her mother

ANNA (contd)
Mom I’m sorry but wellyou had
it coming

Mrs Graham studies her daughter for a moment a look of
curiosity on her face She reaches out a hand toward her
Anna cautiously takes it and pulls Mrs Graham to her feet
She responds by giving Anna a deep hug

MRS GRAHAM
I know baby I know I just didn’t
think anyone would ever give it to
me (BEAT) Now go Just get out of
here

Anna gathers up her things and grabs Damon’s hand They dash
down the street as Mr Graham goes to the aid of his wife
She loses her balance a bit Mr Graham holds her firmly

MRS GRAHAM (cont’d)
And don’t you go getting any ideas

MR GRAHAM
Oh loosen up will ya

Mr Graham looks around then SMACKS his wife affectionately
on the ass--she goes wide-eyed Then the thinnest of smiles
EXT CITY STREET CONTINUOUS - VARIOUS SHOTS

Anna and Damon running crouching down when A POLICE CAR zips
past They sneak down an alley and then cut across an avenue
WE LOSE THEM as they blend into the early morning rush of
PEDESTRIANS

INT BROADWAY THEATER DRESSING ROOM - LATER

Annas homey touches in all corners Flowers Throw pillows

into the smiling Nathaniel

By now Anna has pulled away from Nathaniel’s hold and is
slowly backing toward the door

She glances at the closet door then starts to gather her
coat Hat Purse At a slow steady pace Nathaniel follows

ANNA
I don’twhat’s the matter
NATHANIEL

ANNA

Okay right then maybe we should

NATHANTEL

Anna has run out of space She finds herself up against the
door Nathaniel looms closer Suddenly a KNOCK Thankful
Anna wheels around and pulls it open Nathaniel turns away

In the hallway beaming with pride is Phillip

ANNA
---Phillip hi I didn’t know that
anyone else was still here

PHILLIP
Sorry I waited outside for you

Anna self-conscious now turns to Nathaniel then back to
Phillip
ANNA (contd)
I’m sorry Im being rude I should

Nathaniel this is Phillip

Phillip rolls forward extending a hand

PHILLIP
No no my fault Hello (HAND OUT)
I’m Phillip Tweely

Nathaniel turns and moves toward him Smile on his face

NATHANIEL
-we’ve met actually

Phillip’s face slowly goes stark white Like he’s seen a
ghost In a way I guess he has

PHILLIP
(whispers)
-ohmyGod Your face

A PUNCH from Nathaniel knocks Phillip straight back and out
of his chair The actor slumps to the ground unconscious
This has all happened too fast Anna can’t process She looks
over at Nathaniel who moves quickly toward her

ANNA
What the hell is (REALIZING)
---you‘re ‘Ben’

NATHANIEL
Well I prefer ‘Benjamin’ but

Nathaniel BACKHANDS Anna knocking her against the closet
door she slides down it to the floor A BANGING SOUND from
behind it

Anna clears her head and crawls toward the exit Nathaniel
moves past her He SMASHES through the closet door and pulls
out a struggling Damon

NATHANIEL (cont‘d)
-wéll hello stranger ‘Member
me

He SMACKS Damon several times Damon slumps to the ground

Nathaniel is about to hit Damon again when he realizes that
Anna has gotten to her feet He jumps up throwing himself on
her His hands close around her throat Anna’s eyes go wide
Lids fluttering He lets go and Anna drops to the floor
COUGHING LOUDLY Nathaniel towers over her
ANNA
---I knowI know about you

NATHANIEL
You sound disappointed Anna It’s
hard being used I’m sure

ANNA
“Used”

NATHANIEL
You were my cCarrotI’m not sure
I would’ve gotten ‘em without you

Nathaniel reaches down and pulls the dazed Anna to her feet

NATHANIEL (contd)
By the by thanks for making it so
simple to find him Locking him in
your closet was a big help

ANNA
This isn’t happeningit’s not

Anna tries to kick Nathaniel but he blocks it--he shakes his
head and PUSHES her back against the dressing room door It
EXPLODES open dropping her hard to the stage floor The edge
of a Victorian setting can be seen just beyond -

NATHANTEL
Oh it isit totally is (BEAT )
See I knew how Phillip ended up
and I enjoyed watching him every
day as he blundered about in his
chair Pathetic But then I found
out the truth

Nathaniel scoops her up again kisses her on the forehead He
smiles then grips both sides of her face

NATHANIEL (cont‘d)
He’s the one who sold me out Ol’
Damon the weirdo brother

Suddenly’ Nathaniel stops stepping back and looking down
Damon is now at his feet holding on for dear life GO CLOSE
to see two syringes sticking out of Nathaniel’s right calf

A SCREAM rises up in Nathaniel’s throat he SLAMS Damon back
with a KICK then falls down and starts pulling the needles
out of his leg

Anna staggers to her feet and disappears out onto the stage
Nathaniel scowls tnen gets up and follows Limping now He
is about to give chase when his cell phone RINGS He answers

NATHANIEL (cont‘d)
Hello Oh yes Sure’The Power
of Positive Eating’ pep rallies are
on Tuesday nights At the ‘Y’ of
course Quite alright

INT BROADWAY THEATER - ACT I ‘CONSULTING ROOM’ — LATER

No one around The stage has been reset for Act I and the
work lights are on They shine down on a beautifully realized
doctors office complete with table and instrumentation
It’s fake but no one seems to be complaining

Nathaniel is moving slowly about in the shadows checking
behind corners and pieces of furniture

NATHANIEL
isn’t this fun Anna Hide-and-
Seek

Anna is wedged into a space behind the set trying to hide
Looking around desperately for an avenue of escape She is
trying to unfasten a hook from the set sound of CREAKING
FOOTSTEPS coming closer

ANNA
(taking a chance)
Nathaniel listen to me

NATHANIEL
It’s Benjamin Please don’t make
that mistake again

ANNA
-Benjaminyouve got to believe
me Damon didn’t do

NATHANIEL
Anna don’t Please do not take me
for anything other than clever
Because I am Very That’s how I’ve
lasted this long okay Now I made
a mistake the first timeI don’t
‘plan to do it again

ANNA
But he didn’t He

NATHANTEL
Didnt what Turn me in Of course
he did I shouldve seen it before
but Phillip there played the hero
and messed it all up His only
mistake was becoming so popular
Suddenly Nathaniel pulls open a ‘door’ near her and jumps
through He moves quickly forward

NATHANIEL (contd)
Boo

Anna is ready though and swings the heavy hook around and
catches Nathaniel square in the head He drops to the floor

Anna runs past the bleeding Nathaniel who tries to grab her
She darts in and out of the set pieces Eventually she finds
herself against the brick wall of the theater and backed into
a corner A ladder next to her She begins climbing

As she goes higher she feels the rungs shudder--Nathaniel is
crawling up slowly beneath her

NATHANIEL (cont’d)
TV Guide did a big piece on Phillip
this year and the writer did a hell
of a job getting the real story I
mean from the cops and everything

Anna is near the catwalk now she reaches out for it as a
hand falls on her ankle Anna tries to shake it off but
can’t Nathaniel isn’t letting go

NATHANIEL (cont‘d) -
Quite honestly Damon was a bitch
to track down Hard as hell I had
some guys on it full time--you met
them actually In the subwayand
then in the street that one night

Anna’s eyes widen it’s all been a trick with Nathaniel All
of it He smiles nodding as he reaches for her leg Just
misses it

NATHANIEL (contd)
Yepeven that was a set-up Isn’t
that naughty

Desperate she makes a jump off the ladder toward the walkwa

in front of her Anna catches it and pulls herself up onto it-
-her physical training is coming in handy now isn’t it

Nathaniel APPLAUDS this move and then pulls himself up onto
the rickety ledge They are both fifty feet above the ground
on a swinging wooden bridge Running out of space

NATHANTEL (cont‘’d)
(enjoying the game)
---this 1s really the best part of
all Killing somebody in front of
their loved ones I live for it

Anna is up against it--nearly to the other side Desperate
she reaches into her purse and withdraws the plastic water
gun Points it down at Nathaniel who smiles at this

NATHANTEL (cont‘d)
e omy My Scary

ANNA
Don’t do thisyou can still
I mean

NATHANIEL

‘Still’ what Get ‘help’ Jesus
Anna pleasethink-before-you-
speak I do not want help I want
to perform surgery I want to do my
job what I was born to do And
what these two took away from me

Nathaniel is about to lunge at her she SHOOTS at him

The ice bullet hits Nathaniel in the neck and he staggers
back and off the side of the catwalk Instead of plunging
down however he remains suspended in mid-air

The force of his fall jars the walkway though and Anna is
flipped off the structure she reaches out as she falls and
-Just catches the lip of the Act IV ‘studio’ set She swings
wildly back and forth bumping into the bobbing Nathaniel

NATHANIEL (contd)
What the hell What’s happening to
me Help me help ME

Nathaniel is beginning to float higher He drifts up through
the various suspended set pieces settling there and YELLING
his head off Anna watches him but is slowly losing her grip

DAMON
(from below)
-hold on Anna Hold on

Damon is at the fly rail desperately trying to figure out
how to work the complicated mess of ropes and handles GO
CLOSE as ‘a hand falls on his leg He looks down--Phillip is
at his feet having pulled himself across the stage

PHILLIP
Need a hand brother (SMILES) Help
me up quick

Damon lifts Phillip to his feet Phillip looks up identifies
the correct pulley and unlatches the rigging With his upper-
body strength he has no problem guiding the set piece safely
to the ground Anna jumps the last bit to the floor
Damon rushes to her and hugs her tightly They kiss Deeply

DAMON
-oh Anna Graham I love you

ANNA
See I told you so

They smile and kiss again as Phillip crawls over and joins
them Damon turns to Phillip and the two brothers hug for the
first time in a very long time

Tears from both as Damon holds Phillip’s face in his hands
Anna leans back against the stage exhausted

DAMON
---it’s been so long So so long
PHILLIP
I know Forgive me
DAMON
Of course of course
PHILLIP
How did all this happen
DAMON °
Long story
PHILLIP
Well we’ve got the rest of our
lives
DAMON

longer than that (GLANCES AT
ANNA) Much longer

The siblings hug again and then almost in unison look up at
a CRASHING sound Nathaniel is thrashing about hopelessly
tangled in the overhead machinery of the cavernous fly space

PHILLIP
Should we call someone The police

DAMON
If you like He’s had an overdose
though I’m afraid There’s nothing
we can do for himhe’s a goner

GC CLOSE to see a handful of personalized cards fall out of
Nathaniel’s pocket and to the ground Moments later water

begins to sprinkle down onto them from above Nathaniel is

raining The ink on his name begins to run
The three survivors glance up then look at one another It’s
been decided not a word about this will be spoken They sit
back exhausted silent Tearful

Sound of APPLAUSE begins to play over GETTING LOUDER

INT BROADWAY THEATER - ACT V ‘GALLERY’ SET - DAY

The theater is packed with PATRONS all on their feet and
APPLAUDING madly Shouts of “Bravo” fill the air THE CAST
of The Doctors Dilemma are taking their bows Suddenly they
part as Anna and Phillip enter Anna moves forward next to
Phillip in his wheelchair

She smiles at the audience then motions toward her co-star
who slowly does the unthinkable he stands Yes you read it
correctly ‘stands’ Actually he is floating (thanks to
Damon’s serum) but the audience doesn’t know it He bobs a
little but overall it is pretty remarkable to behold

APPLAUSE becomes wilder as WE PAN around the room picking
out a few of the patrons There are Trina and Larry Nearby
a few women from the boutique All dressed up A somewhat
humbled Aaron Smith claps from the cheap seats A few rows
down sits Mr Horvath and a few others from the ’Gentle
Arms’

MR HORVATH
-what did I say what did I say
I told you he would walk again

Mr Graham stands down front CLAPPING LOUDLY Next to him
Mrs Graham who is still seated Slowly she rises to her
feet and joins in the THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE Another smile

Mr Graham elbows the person next to him It happens to be
Damon who is standing and smiling sadly Only now do WE
realize that he is dressed in ordinary clothes--a tuxedo He
is perspiring and pulls absently at the tie around his neck

From the stage Anna flashes Damon a smile then she is swept
back into the moment by the appreciation radiating from this
opening night crowd She executes a letter-perfect curtsey

INT “CUMULUS” RESTAURANT - LATER THAT NIGHT

The sleek white restaurant is hosting a premiere party LOTS
OF PEOPLE milling about Most of them congratulating Phillip
(who bobs just slightly above them all) and Anna who wanders
around with a drink and is looking for something Or someone

Anna spots a booth with its blue curtain drawn and moves to
it slipping inside She finds Damon sitting in the near
dark huddled in one corner and nearly undressed
ANNA
-honey whats wrong

DAMON
Dunno I just know something is

ANNA
What ‘wrong

DAMON
Yes I mean me here in these
clothes Surroundings I can’t do
it

ANNA
So lets go then that’s fine

DAMON
No Anna not just these normal
clothes It’s something elseI
think it’s the fact that I’m trying
so hard to go against it Nature
that is

ANNA
What does that mean

DAMON -
It means that most things--my work
your art our love--these things
are ephemeral they’re intangible
and that’s what’s so horrible about
them And wonderful too Now you
see them now you don’t

ANNA
What‘re you talking about People
love each other then they’re with
each other I don’t see where

DAMON
Yes right the love will always be
therebut we move on Just like
clouds It’s natural

ANNA
What ‘re you Sayingyou don’t love
me orI don’t understand Damon

DAMON
Shh shhit’s alright I’m saying
just the opposite I love you so
completely Annaand that love
has made me realize how much I
still have to do

Anna moves closer to him kisses him Damon responds

ANNA
Look its a big night and youre
probablylet’s go home I bet
youre just tired

DAMON
Alright yes Maybe that’s it

Damon smiles at her then pulls Anna toward him--they embrace
in one of those old-time movie clenches Deep and endless

EXT CITY STREET - BROADWAY THEATER - A DIFFERENT DAY

On the sidewalk near the ‘stage door’ of a glamorous old
Broadway theater FANS crowd around after the show waiting
Suddenly a radiant Anna emerges from doorway carrying a few
bundles of flowers She is mobbed ever gracious Anna stops
and signs a few autographs

After a moment she nods and smiles then dashes out toward
a passing taxi She catches it and heads uptown CRANE UP to
see the yellow cab in traffic Nearby is the blinking sign
for Shaws The Doctor’s Dilemma

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS ANNA’S APARTMENT — STILL LATER

The door swings open Anna bounds in She seems finally at
ease Almost happy She kicks off her shoes sets down the
bouquets and looks around for Damon Doesn’t see him Spots
chat the bathroom door is closed A pile of clothing on the
floor

ANNA
- honey are you home Hello I

DAMON
(offscreen)

She goes to the door and SPEAKS through it

ANNA
-»-plus I’ve got a surprise Guess

DAMON
(offscreen)

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - ANNA’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna looks in but it is empty The shower curtain drawn

ANNA

Damon peeks out from behind the curtain Looks into her eyes

DAMON

happening faster than I thought

ANNA
What is Damon

DAMON
We don’t have much time Please

been trying to hide it but

ANNA
Whats going on Tell me (SHE
STUDIES HIM) Why are you crying

DAMON
Theyre not-tears Im afraid

Worried now Anna crosses quickly to the curtain and pulls it

back

She isn’t ready for what she sees

Damon is seated clutching the sides of the tub and up to his
waist in water More specifically that’s all that’s left of
him now everything from the waist up The rest of him is
simply gone Anna covers her mouth and sits next to him

DAMON (contd)
-Im turning into vapor and I
don’t want to leave just yet

Anna nods catching herself Starts to tear up Damon tries

to shift a bit clinging to the side of the bathtub

ANNA
-did you (REALIZING) You did

it didn’t you An overdose

DAMON
Mmmmm—hmmmm ‘Fraid so

ANNA
Oh Damon whywhy

DAMON

ANNA
Because WHY

DAMON
Because I needed to know Know what
was too much so that Phillip can
always

ANNA
--noNO

DAMON
Yes You see after the run-in with
Benjamin I worried that my serum
wasn’t working It took so long to
take hold So I began to up the
dosage to experiment on myself

ANNA
But I thought you were happyI
am I am so happy now why would
you do this to me To US

DAMON
I didn’t AnnaI did it to me
And for someone else Both of you

Anna starts to cry not understanding Damon struggles to
move his hand over and pull her closer to him

DAMON (cont’d)
Remember I said we had to be honest
with one another so

ANNA
Damon I can’t do this I can’t
Yes I’m stronger now and thinner
and a better actress but it only
holds together if youre with me

DAMON
No no now listen

ANNA
“No you listen I-need-you You are
it for me You gave me all this
lifebut what the hell good is it
if I don’t have anyone to share it
with Then it’s nothing I wanted a
career so that everyone would love
me You were right That’s what I
used to want But in the end that
everyone is you Just you (CRIES)
Damon I love you
DAMON
I know you do I know and I love
you Annabut it’s not enough It
isn’t I have tried to fit in I
have to wear cotton trousers and
think normal thoughts but I can’t
I cannot

ANNA
Yes you can I’ll help you

DAMON
Ever since weve been here--even
before the whole ‘Benjamin’ thing--
I’ve wanted you back Back in the
cage and locked up where I could
keep you away from everyone else
Only mine Its wrong and bad but
I cannot help myself I want it I
lay there in our bed at night and
imagine ways to do it again and I
know sooner or later I would I
will And be happy doing it Anna
Even if it kills you (BEAT)so I
had to kill me first

ANNA
No no no Damonoh God we’ve
got to get you to the

Anna starts to pull on Damon but he fights it With one hand
he gestures toward the tub full of liquid that he’s becoming

DAMON
Dont you’1l spill me I want you
to keep thisme when I’m gone
(BEAT) My whole life has been about
pushing on boundaries against the
scientific envelope as it were
that’s all I knew how to do Until
you taught me something morethe
human factor

He smiles at her reaching again for her hand She takes his

DAMON (cont‘d)
Spread a little of me around the
estate for posterity When you
need more serum for Phillip the
formula is locked in my labalong
with all my data Show it to the
world when you think theyre ready

ANNA

Anna reaches over and pulls Damon tightly to her
DAMON
Easy darlingI’m starting to go
now

She shifts a bit and holds him gently After a moment they
kiss Long and full and forever A final hug So tight

DAMON (contd)
(whispers)
»O damn

INT EAST SIDE APARTMENTS - ANNAS BATHROOM — EVENING

The studio apartment standing empty Everything is quiet
with a little moonlight spilling in through the window

From the bathroom comes the SOUND of splashing WE MOVE IN
to see Anna still in her clothes lying in the massive tub
Only her face out of the water Submerged in the water that
was once Damon She takes a little in one hand and lets the
clear liquid trickle over her face Remembering

EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE GREAT LAWN - A DIFFERENT DAY

A perfect day Clouds in the sky Damon’s clouds in fact
hanging low and covering the property House in the distance

Damon’s Volvo slowly ambles up the driveway After a moment
Anna gets out and looks around

Anna wanders about toward the front door Silent Tranquil
A jug of water hanging loose in one hand The word “Damon”
clearly legible on its side in magic marker

EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - THE COURT YARD - SAME TIME

The place seems dormant Still as a painting WE SEE Anna
now staring out at the shimmering surface of Damon‘s pond

ANNA
-there aren’t really any stones
are there No That’s the point

Suddenly Anna is walking purposefully across the surface of
the pond no longer afraid Of anything Past the swans and
out toward the center of this miraculous stretch of liquid

After a while Anna stops and looks around SOUNDS of nature
She uncaps the jug and begins to pour ‘Damon’ out The water
from the gallon container mixes with the water of the pond
at the same instant snow begins to fall

A blanket of white slowly appears covering everything in
sight Anna stands where she is eyes closed arms and face
stretched upward she is content a smile creeping across her
face She opens her eyes slowly looking up at the falling
flakes She follows them down to the water where they begin
to disappear All except a handful

GO CLOSE to see etched in snowflakes that dance and shimmer
the words “O DAMN” on the water It may just be a trick of
the light but for a moment they are there

WE LIFT OFF now soaring high above the property Up up up
as Westchester County and indeed New York itself begins to
disappear Until we are floating through only clouds Nothing
but glorious white A shadow passes by perhaps the outline
of a man Lying back At peace

Perhaps But Ill never tell

SLOW FADE OUT
