INT OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY

The lobby of an architectural firm AMANDA COLE 28 the
uber office manager books it toward an elevator Every hair
in place she could be out of a J Crew catalogue

She somehow downloads an iPhone app listens on her
bluetooth and highlights a stack of papers at the same
time Totally in control - the queen of the office

She eyes a COWORKER walking ahead of her and speeds up
beating him to the elevator button

INT AMANDA’S OFFICE

Amanda swings the door open - it’s small but meticulously
organized Maybe color coordinated

NICK PATEL 30 Indian not bad looking but more of the
perpetual best friend type sits with his feet up at her
desk
AMANDA
What are you doing here Noodle And the
feet

She motions for him to take his feet down

NICK
Just thought I’d bring my Amoodle lunch

We now see a napkin has been covering her desk He whips it
away - an OFFICE PICNIC

AMANDA
This is so perfect

NICK
You’re so perfect

Barf Except these two love this kind of conversation

Amanda rummages through the basket of food
AMANDA
No salad You know I’m dieting for the
water games this weekend

NICK
Hmmm it’s not in there

He picks up her phone

NICK (CONTD)
Howie could you bring in the “salad”

AMANDA
Why does Howie --

HOWIE a gawky assistant hands Nick a box Not a salad box

Nick drops rose petals on the ground in a shape that
somewhat resembles a heart A couple office workers have
gathered to watch Nick gets down on one knee

NICK
Amanda Elizabeth Cole will you marry me

Amanda bursts into tears and nods enthusiastically Nick
bear hugs her and spins her around and around

The office erupts in applause Amanda curtsies to them - she
couldn’t be more pleased that they’re watching

INT ADOPTION AGENCY - OFFICE

ERIN COLE 33 the former class everything all grown up
still rocking the jeans and sneakers look sits next to
GLENN BECKER 35 her male counterpart except for his rule-
following tendencies They both wear hopeful smiles

Behind a desk an OFFICE LADY shuffles through files

OFFICE LADY
I’m sorry

Not the news they were expecting

GLENN
I don’t understand I have a great job
Erin runs her own business --

ERIN
-- and we’ve been living together six
years
OFFICE LADY
Right It’s just honestly the
problem is that you’re not legally bound

A stunned moment

ERIN
Really that’s the problem In this
city six years is longer than it takes a
normal couple to move in get a ring
realize that meeting at a club should not
lead to marriage and get divorced

OFFICE LADY
Agreed but it’s not up to me Most of
these girls come from broken homes All
they want is for their baby to go toa
stable married couple
An idea pops into Erin’s head

ERIN
Be right back

She rushes out Glenn smiles uneasily at the office lady

mini-spaceship She tosses it aside Another quarter - a

EXT BROOKLYN - DAY

A beautiful summer day Erin and Glenn walk down a sidewalk
lined with cute brownstones and shops

She eyes a KID as they get to a corner and speeds up to get
to the CROSSWALK BUTTON before him Presses it victoriously

Glenn takes hand sanitizer out of his pocket and squirts
some in her hands

He takes a couple side glances at his now fiance
GLENN

How are you just casually walking down
the street
ERIN
Hmmm I think I’m just putting one foot
in front of the other Like so --

He stops her

ERIN (CONTD)
Whoa End of casual walking

GLENN
Are we really doing this

He holds up the toy ring

ERIN
Yeah why not

She puts out her hand as he “rings” her

GLENN
Sounds familiar since I’ve been asking
you that for the past five years

She shrugs

GLENN (CONTD)
Really Come on Think about all those
years spent convincing every single
person you know that yes you’re-- were
totally happy never getting married

ERIN
Nah I’1l still be having those
arguments I stand by the fact that
marriage is a pointless institution

GLENN
Erin I’m serious You know I want this
but I’m completely content being the envy
of my married friends

ERIN
I know And that’s why I love you But
apparently if we wanna have a family we
have to be married This is gonna be fun
She kisses him

ERIN (CONTD)
Spice things up a bit

Glenn raises his eyebrows - what needs spicing They

stop

in front of a cute TRAVEL BOOKSHOP Erin unlocks the door
ERIN (CONTD)
Plus there’s the honeymoon We finally
have an excuse to take a trip and

ERIN
He was thanking me for being both hot and
sarcastic Deadly combo

MIA
Remember me The single one (beat)
And we’re out celebrating your
engagement

Erin hangs her head

ERIN
I don’t know why I need so much attention
when I drink

MIA
I do since every time you drink you
complain that you and Glenn never have
“Petey-sex”

ERIN
I say that

MIA
Uh huh Every time you drink

ERIN
Ugh I don’t think you can have Petey-sex
with anyone but Petey

MIA
Sucks that you were ruined by your first
boyfriend

Erin thinks for a long beat Probably remembering something
very specific

ERIN
Were working on it So I’ma little
bored That’s normal right

MIA
Is it normal that I’ve had sixteen
boyfriends since you’ve been with Glenn

ERIN
Normal’s apparently subjective

She raises her martini

ERIN (CONTD)
To my engagement to an amazing man who I
love with all my heart

MIA
Who you’re totally okay never having
earth shattering sex with

ERIN
Never say never It’s a work in progress

way more important things in life
A SUPER HOT guy grabs the face of a GIRL and kisses her
passionately Erin and Mia both sigh

True love’s true love no matter when you
find it

AMANDA
So I was thinking this color for the
saris

She points to her bright blue sari

AMANDA (CONTD)
But I’m open to suggestions if they’re
good

ERIN
It’s a tad bright

HAYLIE
Do we get to wear saris too Cuz I can
stitch a mean sequin

AMANDA
Uh huh But that’s just for the Indian
wedding We’re having two weddings

SUSAN
Wow Sounds pricey Can’t you just
combine the two ceremonies

AMANDA
Yeah but this way I can do the white
dress and the red sari Otherwise I’1l
feel gypped

SUSAN
Geesh Nick’s grief counseling must be
going well

AMANDA

Mmm it’s okay We could use a few more
deaths in the county But he got a
partner (whispering) A sex therapist

HAYLIE
Uh-oh bet that freaks you out

AMANDA
Haylie your hair’s blue

life together instead

AMANDA
We are saving for our life together --

HAYLIE
-- Jakey and I were thinking destination

SUSAN

The three of them turn and stare at their mom Amanda has a

phase not a real relationship You don’t
deserve the wedding money

ERIN

been with my fiance the longest

HAYLIE

Amanda) And you got braces I don’t get

looks down at her now ruined white dress

AMANDA (CONTD)

She covers her mouth - did she just say C-Word

HAYLIE
You even think about telling Jake I was
married for a second and I will gladly
have a convo with Nick and his entire
family about your fun night with the
whole football team

Amanda screams and CLOBBERS Haylie

AMANDA
It was just the starters you mother
effer And you know that was before I

Erin pulls them apart Haylie makes a run for it Amanda
chases after her

AMANDA (CONTD)

Erin chases after them both Susan at her heels They run
screaming down the hallway and into the living room Amanda
STOPS SHORT when she realizes that Nick is staring at her
in shock She smooths her hair back into a tight ponytail
and takes a deep breath Like dominos Haylie Erin and
Susan all run into her and TUMBLE TO THE GROUND

Jake is frozen jaw dropped He whispers to Glenn

JAKE

HARRY

Susan grabs the trophy Erin grabs it out of her hands
before she can speak again

ERIN
You wanna use the games to decide who
gets the wedding

No one answers She realizes she has to hand the stick over
Ugh Jake’s hand is raised

JAKE

ERIN
You wanna use the games to decide who

Harry nods and mouths “can’t speak”

ERIN (CONTD)

Susan shoots Harry a look - “told ya so”
HARRY

They pass the trophy back and forth during the convo

Wedding Fund was a horrible lie

Erin grabs the trophy

ERIN

Records that I don’t think this is ideal
But I’1ll play in honor of the Luke Perry
pillow that should’ve been mine And also

An ICE CREAM truck pulls up in front of them blaring the
typical tune The driver jumps out and takes a cooler into
town hall Amanda eyes him and eyes the truck which still
plays the music

AMANDA
You still have that pen

Nick looks at her like she’s nuts

AMANDA (CONTD)
I cannot have a town hall wedding Plus
you wanna make your mom happy right

Nick scribbles a note

AMANDA (CONTD)
Tell him we’ll bring him candy later

NICK
It’s an ice cream truck

AMANDA
Tell him we’1l bring him Hustler later

NICK
Youre sure you want to do this Consider
how you’ll feel later when ---

AMANDA
Stop counseling me

He flinches She takes a deep breath And pulls her hair
back into a tight ponytail

AMANDA (CONTD)
Come on sweetheart We’re going to camp

EXT CAMP HIAWATHA

Amanda and Nick pull the ice cream truck to a screeching
stop at the entrance to a picturesque camp All camp
activity - painting riding horses playing tag - comes to a
dead halt

Right on cue hundreds of SCREAMING KIDS storm the truck

AMANDA
Oh how cute

Nick’s face says the opposite They try to leave

SCREAMING BOY
Can I get a rocket pop

SCREAMING GIRL
Klondike bar please

SCREAMING BOY 2
Flying sauuuuucer

AMANDA
Okay getting a bit less cute We have to
find the clue

Nick looks out at the sea of kids rocking their truck
They’re being blocked in

NICK
Oh my God I’m so glad we have another
five to ten years of quiet

Amanda freezes

AMANDA
What’s that supposed to mean

NICK
They’re just so loud --

AMANDA
No What do you mean five to ten years

NICK
Ummm five years When my practice is set
and we have kids

Uh oh

AMANDA

(calmly )
Noodle we’re having kids in two years
Like I’ve always said I’ve always said
my whole life that I will have a child
before I turn thirty That’s just the
normal progression of a couple

The kids keep on yelling for ice cream

NICK
Okay Amoodle I just assumed that we’d be
married for awhile before we started a
family

She starts to lose it a little now Plus a TINY CAMPER
climbs in the truck and throws ice cream out to his friends

AMANDA
Hey get outta here

The kid sticks his tongue out

AMANDA (CONTD)
Color me an idiot for thinking that when
you proposed you were agreeing to the
things I wanted I’m having kids soon

NICK
Alright it’s just my mom said that she
was glad --

AMANDA

-- I don’t care what your mom said And
while we’re at itI’m sorry if your mom
wants a huge Indian wedding but I’m
getting married in a beautiful church and
wearing a beautiful white dress like all
my friends

NICK
Amood-

AMANDA
And don’t call me Amoodle when I’m angry

She pushes through the kids and climbs out

NICK

(to the kid in truck)
She’s not usually like this

EXT STREET
Erin’s on the side of the road - hitchhiker thumb out

GLENN

Do you know the statistics on hitch
hiking
ERIN
No could you google them for me

A car slows down - Erin pulls her shirt off one shoulder

Car doesn’t

stop

GLENN
I’m a little confused you didn’t even
want to do this whole game thing in the
first place Now you’re prostituting for
a ride

ERIN
Strippers are not prostitutes And what
I can’t change my mind You’re the one
that always wanted to get married I
thought you’d be happy that I’m actually
into it

Glenn brings her hitch hiking hand down

Erin sighs

GLENN
I’m sorry I didn’t let you cake me Do
you want me to smash my blackberry into
my face in solidarity

ERIN
No I just need you to work on what we
talked about

GLENN
I know Sometimes I forget you think
were boring Because I don’t think we’re
boring Is this a boring conversation

She gives him a look Brings her thumb back up

ERIN
You don’t bore me Us after five years
bores me I’m just afraid of turning into
one of those couples Like the ones that
go out to dinner and order fancy food but
then don’t even talk to each other and
just stare at their caramelized baby
carrots all night --

Glenn smiles finally and puts his thumb out too

GLENN
Erin I love you I’1l work on it
He jumps up and does a weird dance move Just as a truck

pulls over next to them

ERIN
Yes

They climb in

NICK

AMANDA
I’m freaking out about freaking out

Everyone probably think I’m psycho

NICK
It’s okay to “freak out” sometimes You
can’t always be perfect You’re kinda
cute when you yell Of course I’d prefer
if it wasn’t directed at me but I’m
proud of you for losing your cool It’s
sexy And it doesn’t matter what
“everyone” thinks cuz you’re not psycho

Which is almost as broken as this ring

Susan hugs her

fish
He takes them out of the box

GLENN (CONTD)
Good idea right

She doesn’t look at him
Harry and Susan blow their whistles in unison

HARRY
Alright gang It’s the morning of the big

seeing who’s got what it takes in the
water As always the first team to get
to the other side of the lake wins
Follow the signs along the way

Harry takes WEDDING VEILS out of a bag

But there’s a new twist this year If you

canoe in a flash Glenn struggles with his aqua socks He
can’t quite figure them out Tries to put his sneakers back
on but now he can only find one

ERIN
Just go barefoot

He looks at her like she’s nuts

GLENN
I have sensitive feet Are you gonna let

Erin shakes her head super frustrated She glances over to
Amanda and Nick

Amanda is just as frustrated trying to get Nick into his
life jacket He doesn’t get it He somehow has hooked his
jacket so that one of his arms is stuck

Amanda grabs him and tugs it out She drags him and the
boat to the water

She holds the canoe and waits for Nick

NICK
I can’t go in front

AMANDA
You also just said you can’t steer I

He shakily steps in The canoe rocks

NICK
How do I do it

Just get in

He steadies himself with great effort squats and crawls to
the front Turns around and gives a thumbs up to the crowd
They cheer They take off slowly with Amanda doing most
of the work

AMANDA (CONTD)
Wow this rowing is almost as hard as
knowing you only proposed so it’d be
easier to tell your parents about me

Nick’s caught off guard

NICK
That’s not--

AMANDA
--Just row

EXT LAKE

Haylie and Jake paddle up to the other side of the lake
None of the other couples are even close They high five
A neon sign points to a few makeshift swim lanes leading
through a narrow part of the lake

JAKE
Never thought I’d say this but I’d rather
take that stick-in-my-pee-hole STD test
than play another game

HAYLIE
Youre not having fun I love this crap

They drag the boat up on the sand and take their clothes
off bathing suits underneath

JAKE
You’re funny

HAYLIE
What do you mean Though thank you

They both put on goggles - ridiculous looking

JAKE
Nothing just you’re so competitive with
your sisters and so sure of what you
want when you’re with them

HAYLIE
What’s funny about that

JAKE
I’m just saying

HAYLIE
Is this the decision thing again

He shrugs She runs into the water splashes him

HAYLIE (CONTD)
I will be better at making decisions I
promise

JAKE
Swear

HAYLIE

He runs in after her goes in for a romantic kiss and
dunks her under instead

She puts a soaking veil back on her head

They take off swimming in perfect form down the makeshift
lanes just as --

Amanda and Nick’s canoe is head to head with Erin and
Glenn’s They both paddle furiously continuously glancing
over at each other

Erin and Glenn are barely in the lead Amanda dips her oar
in the lake and splashes water at Erin trying to slow her

ERIN
Hey

She splashes back Amanda’s face is doused

AMANDA
I’m wearing contacts you b-word

She tries to splash Erin back but can’t see anything and
douses Nick instead Nick stops rowing and takes a deep
breath

NICK
One two three

Erin and Glenn reach the shore strip down to their suits
and jump back in the water

ERIN
Too bad you were too big for swim team

AMANDA

Too bad you’re a horrible sister
(to Nick)
What are you doing come on They’re
beating us and she just called me fat
Nick steps out and drags the boat in

NICK
Amoodle you’re kind of scaring me right
now

She puts the goggles on his head and pulls his t-shirt off

AMANDA
Do you want to marry me or not

Nick nods frightened

AMANDA (CONTD)
Then they can’t win - we’1ll all be tied

She dives in expertly Nick steps in the water hesitantly
She’s already halfway to Erin and Glenn Nick doggie
paddles to her

NICK
You know I’m not the best swimmer

She groans and puts his arms around her

AMANDA
Hold on

She swims with him on her back It’s torture

Hey GET OFF MY JET SKI

AMANDA
I have a whiny fiance and a wedding to
win
She revs the engine and speeds away leaving the teen

bobbing in the wake behind them Nick screams and holds on
for dear life

EXT LAKE

Erin and Glenn still swim starting to get tired Erin
stops for a breath as Amanda whirs past them on the jet ski
speeding to the dock where the next sign is

ERIN
Aarrrghhhh

EXT WOODS
Jake and Haylie look up from making out

JAKE
Jimmy

Jimmy pokes his head out from behind the next tree

JAKE (CONTD)
I hear people

JIMMY
Ooops Forgot to stall them

JAKE
Come on dude

Jimmy shrugs apologetically

JIMMY
Sorry boobs

Jake and Haylie quickly try to compose themselves - but his
bow tie is tangled in her bathing suit straps

They struggle to get apart as they watch the other couples
gain on them

HAYLIE
Noooooo

EXT DOCK

Three boats with WATER SKIS are tied to a dock

A neon sign reads - WATER SKI TO FINISH LINE

Amanda expertly pulls the jet ski to the dock and jumps out

AMANDA
D’you think you can drive the boat

Nick shakes his head - noooo way

AMANDA (CONTD)
Have you ever been on water skis

He shakes his head - noooo way

AMANDA (CONTD)
First time for everything

EXT LAKE

Amanda zooms through water Nick’s face is a picture of
horror as he hangs on for dear life He swallows about half
the lake

NICK
OH MY KRIIIISSHNA

AMANDA
YOU’RE DOING GREAT

EXT DOCK

Erin Glenn Haylie and Jake make it to the water skis at
the same time

The girls stare each other down as they get in

HAYLIE

(to Jake)
I know this lake like I know the freckles
on your butt I’m driving

ERIN
(to Glenn)
Don’t even think about it I’m the better
driver

Haylie and Jake are off first

Glenn’s taking awhile getting his aqua socks off so he can
fit into the skis

ERIN (CONTD)
Why would you ever buy those goddamn
things They’re for twelve-year-olds at
camp

GLENN
I told you my feet are really ---

ERIN
--- Rhetorical question Glenn

And they’re off

EXT LAKE
Amanda’s boat still has the lead Until

Nick loses his balance and FALLS Amanda stops the boat

AMANDA
GET UP

NICK
I CANT

AMANDA

WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN’T STAND BACK UP
ON THOSE SKIS RIGHT NOW

She revs the engine and takes off again Nick stands His
bathing suit is gone - he’s NAKED except for the bow tie
Like a CHIPPENDALE

Amanda’s drives the boat doesn’t realize she’s towing a
naked Nick behind her

The other two boats gain speed - closing in behind them
Amanda glances back
AMANDA (CONTD)
AAAAGGGHHH THE WHOLE LAKE CAN SEE YOUR
PRIVATES

Haylie pulls up next to Amanda

HAYLIE
HOLD ON JAKE

She turns the boat - spraying Nick even more

HAYLIE (CONTD)
Oooops My bad

She revs the boat and takes off
Erin narrows her eyes and focuses ahead

GLENN
SLOOOOOW DOOOOWN

He looks like the rest of the guys - ready to barf
Erin just goes faster She’s right behind Amanda now

They race neck to neck Amanda turns to check on the
flailing Nick and doesn’t notice what Erin does

A RAMP in the middle of the lake Erin smiles and turns to
avoid it at the last second leaving Amanda and Nick to

FLY OVER IT

Nick screams bloody murder

EXT FINISH LINE

The crowd including Susan and Harry watch the three
couples come zooming in

Nick goes flying off the ramp His feet slide out of his
skis and he is completely airborne He flies NAKED through
the air - arms flailing wildly

SUSAN
Oh my God he’s nude

AMANDA

It’s just the other two left now Erin gains on Haylie
People cheer wildly - nothing like a water race with nudity

SPECTATOR
Come on Erin

Nick finally CRASHES into the water right in Haylie’s path

HAYLIE
OHHHH SHIIIT
She swerves heading straight into the path of Erin and
Glenn
GLENN
JUUUUUMP

Erin and Glenn both jump into the water as Haylie’s boat
slams into theirs Jake goes flying backwards

ERIN
We can still win if we swim

They take off swimming

Crowd goes wild as Glenn and Erin swim to the finish line -
boats and other players floating in the water

Harry marks the giant tally board All players tied
Harry grabs the MEGAPHONE
HARRY
Ladies and Gents of the neighborhood - we
have a three way tie Since we have our
big anniversary shindig tonight the tie
breaker will have to be played tomorrow

Couples bobbing in water do not look happy about this

INT BEDROOM

Amanda rushes around her room trying to get ready She looks
like she’s about to have a freak out

Nick holds up two ties - they’re both a bit tacky

NICK
Amoodle

AMANDA
Neither People will think you’re a
weirdo if you wear those

NICK
Okay I know it’s just the loss of the
game that’s causing you --
He leaves

Erin passes

Erin sticks

AMANDA
-- I’m not in grief (beat)
Can I just have a second alone

Nick in the hallway

NICK
Good luck

her head in the door

ERIN
Hey Manda I meant to tell you this
morning I’m really sorry about your
ring

AMANDA
Jeez that took you long enough

ERIN
Are you okay

AMANDA
I’m fine Fine A little stressed that’s
all (beat) I just really need to have
this wedding I know you don’t
understand You’re so perfect and
together and I don’t know cool

ERIN
I’m not perf --

AMANDA
-- Yeah you’re like “oh I’m so modern
and chill about relationships” I mean
you come on you never wanted to get
married I’m not like that okay I NEED
his parents to like me

ERIN
And the wedding is gonna help that

AMANDA
Yeah A big nice respectable wedding

ERIN
I’m not so chill about relationships you
know Just because I’m not into the
typical picture perfect life doesn’t mean
I don’t care I need to win this too

AMANDA
Right so you can have one more perfect
thing in your collection of “Erin’s
awesome” collectables

ERIN
No I don’t even know honestly I
need the wedding for us (beat) I mean
Glenn and I have kinda been in a rut
lately The only thing I’m actually
excited about these days is the wedding --

A CRASH from outside Amanda pulls back the curtain Jake
and Haylie on top of rakes they’ve knocked over making out

ERIN (CONTD)
Barf New love

AMANDA
I don’t think Nick and I have had sex
since ugh who knows

ERIN

Of course they’re the only ones not
fighting And having sex

They both stare at their little sister

AMANDA
We can’t let them win It’s only fair
weve put so much more time into our
relationships

Amanda thinks for a moment and then

AMANDA (CONTD)
There is one thing we have that they
don’t

ERIN
Saddlebags

AMANDA
Yes But I was thinking more like the
fact that our fiances know our secrets
Nothing like a little lovers quarrel to
throw them off track

Erin thinks on this

ERIN
No I said I was gonna be the mature one

Another crash

ERIN (CONTD)
Eff it She stole my car She deserves
it

She pokes her head out the window
ERIN (CONTD)
Ohhhh Jaa-aaake
INT CAR - NIGHT
The minivan is packed to the brim with people
SUSAN
Harry you’re driving like a grandma We
want to get there before our guests
HARRY
I’m carrying precious cargo woman My
bride of forty years
They stop at a red light and kiss The rest of the car is
visibly in a different mood than these two
EXT CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT
A community clubhouse on the WATER is decorated for a party
A DECK area is covered with lights and a banner that reads

SUSAN AND HARRY - HAPPY 40 YEARS

Photos of the couple through the years are blown up and
placed around the deck

Friends and relatives fill the place

Haylie dressed in what could only be her own design pours
a glass of champagne and turns to toast Jake She’s beaming

HAYLIE
To us having a bash like this someday

JAKE
Gosh Haylie it sounds like youve said
that before

HAYLIE
What do you mean

JAKE
It just didn’t sound like you really
meant that Like maybe youve said that
before to someone else

Haylie’s face falls

JAKE (CONTD)
Is there something you wanna tell me

She’s silent Jake walks off

EXT PARTY —- BUFFET

Nick and Glenn stand in front of a pretty serious buffet
table A Shepherds Pie stares back at them

NICK
Why does the dessert smell like beef

Amanda taps him on the shoulder

AMANDA
Because it is You’ve never heard of
Shepherds Pie silly

NICK
No Amanda I’ve never heard of Shepherds
Pie I won’t tell anyone though I mean
what will people think that I don’t know
what Shepherds Pie is

AMANDA
That’s not what I meant

Glenn shoots Nick a look - good luck with that And leaves

NICK
I know what you meant Amanda You meant
that shepherds pie and and mini

toast things are more important than
tandoori and naan

AMANDA
Well I’m not the one who decided that
telling his parents that I exist in his
life meant that we had to get married

Nick’s the one left stunned this time

EXT PARTY — DIFFERENT AREA

Erin and Glenn stare at blown up photo of Harry and Susan on
their wedding day They’re dancing and throwing their heads
back in laughter Pretty much the opposite of how Erin and
Glenn look right now

GLENN
Huh
ERIN
Huh
GLENN
No I was just saying huh About the
photo
ERIN
Right
GLENN

I’m boring you again

Erin closes her eyes instead of doing what she wants to -
scream

ERIN
I don’t know what to do Glenn It’s not
like I’m thrilled that we’ve been
fighting all weekend It’s just --

She thinks of the right thing to say The only thing that
she can think of

ERIN (CONTD)
Didn’t it ever occur to you that I might
want a real ring

GLENN
You’ve never wanted to get married Now
you want me to be a psychic and mind read
that you actually did want the physical
embodiment of “a pointless institution”

ERIN
It’s not about that It’s about being
romantic for a change Being I don’t
know a guy that I can fall in love with
again

Again Glenn’s shock is cut off by --
Haylie grabs Erin’s arm

HAYLIE
Did you tell Jake about me being married
before

ERIN

Okay calm down --

HAYLIE
I’M NOT GONNA CALM DOWN

Way too loud Lost of people listening now

HAYLIE (CONTD)
Excuse us

Harry is on a stage as a VIDEO SCREEN comes down

HARRY
Thank you all for being here tonight Our
daughters have made us a little surprise
video that we’d love to share with you --

Haylie grabs Erin and drags her somewhere private under

the cake table
ERIN
Are you kidding me right now
EXT PARTY - UNDER THE CAKE TABLE
They’re on their knees
HAYLIE
How could you do that I told you he
didn’t know

ERIN
Calm down you’re acting like Amanda

AMANDA (0S)
I can hear you you b-word What’s that
supposed to mean

Amanda pulls up the tablecloth and crawls under
ERIN

If you want to call me a bitch just call
me a bitch

AMANDA
Fine What’s that supposed to mean
bitch

ERIN

Thank you You’ve just been a little not
yourself this weekend

AMANDA
Oh just say what you mean Ms Perfect
You mean crazy

ERIN
Hey You were the one that agreed with me
that they don’t deserve to win

HAYLIE
You both think that

AMANDA
Thanks Erin

ERIN
You said it first

EXT PARTY

The party is silent now except for the video playing - it’s
a HOME VIDEO of the girls talking about what great role
models their parents are Sweet and poignant

Harry and Susan stare at their cake table - screaming voices
coming out from under it

HAYLIE (0S)
He’s not a phase He’s the man I’m going
to marry

AMANDA (0S)
You guys think I’m so crazy This whole
family should be in an effing loony bin
A collective gasp from the party
Susan and Harry slink down
SUSAN
(sotto)
Heard that

Glenn motions to the other guys The three of them casually
walk towards the table

GLENN
(to party guests)
Carry on please

EXT PARTY - UNDER THE CAKE TABLE

The girls are crouched looking like they’re about to attack
each other

A hand pulls up the tablecloth

GLENN
Get out of there Everyone can hear you
guys

ERIN

She started it
They each point at someone else and the war is on

The girls lunge at each other Table topples and CAKE GOES
FLYING

Charlie the neighbor gets the brunt of it on his face
Each guy goes for his fiance Nick tries to contain Amanda
but looks more like he’s getting a piggy back ride Jake
holds Haylie by the waist but her arms still flail wildly
Glenn has Erin’s hands but she kicks with all her might

The three couples are now on top of each other - the guys
only adding to the mess

HARRY
Girls It’s our anniversary Get
yourselves together

Erin’s feet make contact with Jake who falls on Haylie

Haylie makes a dash at Erin but gets Glenn instead He lets
go

Erin and Haylie wrestle way too close to the water

With a LOUD SCREAM Amanda breaks free of Nick and joins her
sisters on the ground

Girls wrestle straight into a photo of their parents - it
goes tumbling

Erin reaches for it but in the process trips over the mess
they’ve made She goes flying INTO THE WATER

Not to be outdone Amanda and Haylie follow and continue
their brawl in the water

In the background of the party their video still plays

CUT TO

EXT PARTY - LATER
The girls are soaking
Harry storms to the car with Susan close behind
HARRY
I’ve never been so mortified of my family
in my entire life
SUSAN
We thought you’d learn a lesson from
these games not go back in time ten
years
Car door slams
Amanda cries Nick wipes a tear away
NICK

I think maybe you were right about what
you said before

AMANDA
What
NICK
I wasn’t ready to propose to you yet I’m
sorry
Shes really crying now
Jake stands with Haylie
JAKE

I thought we told each other the truth
How am I supposed to know who the real
Haylie is now

He leaves her stunned

Glenn looks at the car and then back to Erin

GLENN
Is this the family you want to raise with
me Erin You’re all totally out of
control

She looks at her shaken sisters
ERIN
You know what (beat) I don’t know if I
even want to raise a family with you at
this point Because I don’t mind being a
little out of control
She wrings out her hair
ERIN (CONTD)
We got a lot out of control tonight But
were not a bad family Glenn

Glenn shakes his head and follows the rest of the guys

Erin Amanda and Haylie look at the car Harry rolls down
the window

HARRY
Girls I think you need time to think
about this

He drives off

EXT BAR - MOMENTS LATER

The car pulls up to the curb in front of a bar - The guys
reluctant to get out

HARRY
It takes two to tango Do some thinking
gentlemen

Glenn Nick and Jake all pile out Looking somber

EXT STREET

The girls wet trudge home

INT HAYLIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

Haylie sits on her bed alone Takes a stack of photos from
her night stand - she looks totally different in each photo
Goth punk preppy hippy

From under her bed she pulls an old box Inside is her FIRST
WEDDING PHOTO She’s super young and super drunk

She’s about to tear it up but instead sets it on her
night stand
INT AMANDA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Amanda dressed in her sari lays on the floor She stares
up at the ceiling

Takes a deep breath and opens a box of stuff All of the
personalized wedding goods

She flips through it all - the napkins buttons pens
stickers Everything looks cheap and unimportant

AMANDA
I don’t even like buttons

Puts it all back in the box and throws it out

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Erin sits in front of her laptop She scrolls through a huge
iPhoto display of her and Glenn

Photo after photo of posed happiness Nothing candid fun
or out of the ordinary

Erin looks down at her candy ring Takes it off and throws
it away

INT BAR -— LATER

The guys look miserable A few empties sit on the table

JAKE
She could’ve just told me you know

NICK
You wouldn’t have been mad

JAKE
Nah People understand things better than
you think I mean if you love them you
love them

This hits Nick

NICK

I should’ve told my parents about her
GLENN

Wait Your parents don’t know about

Amanda
Nick shakes his head Glenn’s face looks pretty judgmental

NICK
I know what everyone thinks It’s just-
it’s hard for them and I thought I
just thought it’d be easier for them to
deal with if they knew it was the real
deal

It’s all clicking
NICK (CONTD)
But I’ve always known it was They

would’ve understood

Nick looks a little more content Glenn on the other hand
looks like a mac truck just hit him with the truth

GLENN
I don’t know if we’re the real deal
INT AMANDA’S BEDROOM
Amanda paces her room on her cell On hold Finally
AMANDA
Hello No thanks I’m already a Delta
frequent flier Are you in India
She smiles
AMANDA (CONTD)
Yes there is something you can help me
with
INT HAYLIE’S BEDROOM
Haylie takes out a folder - FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
An ACCEPTANCE LETTER is inside She takes a deep breath and

checks “Will be attending” Seals the envelope and puts it
on top of her old wedding photo

EXT HOUSE

Four bedroom lights are on next to each other Three flick
off in a row One remains on

INT MASTER BEDROOM

Susan and Harry do their nightly routine Even if we didn’t
know them wed be able to figure out that they’ve been
together a long time They move and flow in sync with each
other - Susan hands Harry his floss while he hands her a
brush They hug silently

HARRY
They’1l figure it out

SUSAN
I still had a wonderful anniversary

They kiss

HARRY
Me too You’re not mad I told them to
play those crazy games

SUSAN
You know what Our daughters are adults
I think they probably learned a thing or
two from this weekend

HARRY

Hopefully they learned to be a little
more like their mother

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM
Erin lays in the dark Tosses and turns Gets up and tip
toes out of her room

INT KITCHEN

Erin flicks the lights on and grabs a bunch of stuff from
the fridge

Goes to town baking cookies

A floorboard creaks Haylie stands in the doorway

HAYLIE
I never got why baking made you feel
better

ERIN

The repetitive motion of the wooden spoon
is soothing to me And cookie dough is
killer Wanna help

Haylie nods and throws in chocolate chips

ERIN (CONTD)
I’m sorry Hayl I got so caught up in
these dumb games that I thought if I
could just get you guys to have a little
tiny fight then maybe you’d lose the next
one Which now that I say it out loud
is the dumbest idea in the world

Haylie looks up from stirring

HAYLIE
Thanks Sorry about the car thing

More creaky floorboards Amanda’s in the doorway

AMANDA
And maybe I was a little jealous that
you have this new guy who obviously is
totally in love with you and doesn’t ever
want to fight with you

HAYLIE
Nick doesn’t want to fight with you He’s
obsessed with you I mean he wore that
shirt with the picture of you guys on it

AMANDA
You noticed

Haylie nods as Erin pours chips into the bowl that Haylie
holds Amanda grabs a spoon and stirs

AMANDA (CONTD)
I know I got a little crazy

ERIN
We all got crazy

Beat
HAYLIE
I know I’m young to get married You know
that right It’s not like I planned to do
this now But I met him and I know he’s
the one

(beat)
I was just scared to tell him who I used
to be You guys are so sure of yourselves
all the time it’s harder for me

ERIN
Oh wow I thought I couldn’t feel worse
about what I did

HAYLIE
It’s fine We all have our things

AMANDA
This’ll make you feel better I kind of
understand why Nick doesn’t want to be
around me I mean I basically tricked
him into getting married

They line up cookie dough on a tray

AMANDA (CONTD)
And if that weren’t bridezilla enough for
you I didn’t even notice that it wasn’t
actually his idea

ERIN
You like things to be perfect It’s not
the worst quality

(beat)
I think I’ve got the kicker I’m gonna
call off my engagement

Her sisters’ jaws drop

AMANDA
Well that’s fine right I mean you guys
didn’t want to get married in the first
place

ERIN
No I didn’t want to get married He did
But watching you guys this weekend and
thinking about having a wedding for
myself I realized that maybe I did
always want to get married Just not to
Glenn

The truth shocks Erin a little

Amanda hugs her as Haylie slides the tray into the oven
Amanda takes out milk and pours a tall glass

Erin grabs a pen and writes a note Dear Mom and Dad We’ve
been really bad daughters this weekend Please accept our
apology and cookies Love Erin Amanda and Haylie Cole

ERIN (CONTD)
Word to the wise - we’re never playing
those atrocious games again

AMANDA
Agreed

HAYLIE
Burn the trophy case

INT MASTER BEDROOM

Harry and Susan sleep A KNOCK at the door Erin comes in
and climbs in between her parents

ERIN
Hello You up

She nudges her mom - Susan’s eyes open

SUSAN
Is everything okay

ERIN
Sorry we ruined your anniversary

Harry’s awake now too

SUSAN
Were sorry we never realized that making
you guys fight for something every year
wasn’t the best idea

HARRY
You didn’t ruin our anniversary It was a
just a party What we’re celebrating is
what matters Our family is what matters
we don’t need a party to know that

Erin thinks about this for a minute

ERIN
Will you come tuck me in
HARRY
I’1l never get tired of hearing that
question

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
Erin’s sound asleep Glenn watches her from a chair
She stirs and opens her eyes groggily

GLENN

Hi I didn’t wanna wake you I just
couldnt sleep

ERIN
Do you hate me
GLENN
The opposite
(beat)

But I think
He doesn’t know how to say it

ERIN
I know

Erin starts to cry

ERIN (CONTD)
I’m so sorry Glenn I don’t know how this
happened It’s not your fault I think
maybe I’ve always known deep down that
we weren’t right for me Maybe that’s why
I was okay with never getting married
And part of me thought that having a baby
with you would change things make
everything better

GLENN
I know I’ve always somewhere sort of
known that I’m sorry I pretended it was
okay And I’1l never hate you Er

He hugs her She rests her head on his shoulder

INT LIVING ROOM

Amanda’s asleep on the couch Nick nudges her

NICK
Amoodle

Amanda makes a sound

NICK (CONTD)
Babe wake up

She opens one eye

AMANDA
Where am I Why am I on the couch

A dial tone from the phone that’s pressed to her cheek

AMANDA (CONTD)
Oh yeah I have something --

NICK
No don’t say anything I have something
to say

AMANDA

So do I Okay I fell asleep
practicing so it might not be perfect

She catches herself
AMANDA (CONTD)
Which is okay it’s okay not to be
perfect
He nods smiling
AMANDA (CONTD)

Nick May thumhe pyaar kartha hoo (I
love you I’m sorry for being so crazy)

NICK
How’d you --
AMANDA
I had some help from a very friendly lady
at Delta
He’s grinning
NICK

Well what I was gonna tell you was that I
should’ve told my parents and I’m sorry
Really sorry I never thought about how
it made you feel

She nods in agreement He looks down nervously

NICK (CONTD)
But I also think we took things a little
faster than we should have --

AMANDA
-- I didn’t mean you had to propose to
me I just wanted to be part of your
whole life

NICK
Really I want that too I want nothing
more then to marry you but first

He gets off the couch and down on one knee holds her hand
Amanda is totally confused

NICK (CONTD)
Amanda Elizabeth Cole Will you move in
with me

AMANDA
Yes I’d love to

They kiss He comes back to the couch and cuddles with her

AMANDA (CONTD)
You want the ring back

NICK
Nope You can tell everyone it’s the most
expensive promise ring ever

INT HAYLIE’S BEDROOM

Haylie pulls her covers over herself Jake holds the wedding
photo He laughs

HAYLIE
I didn’t think it’d get that reaction
JAKE
You look silly Well silly and drunk
HAYLIE
I was wasted I’m sorry I didn’t tell
you
JAKE

You know I --

HAYLIE
No Let me say this I need to

He nods pleased

HAYLIE (CONTD)
I’ve never really known who I was People
like my sisters and you you guys
know who you are It comes easy to you
It’s taken me a little longer and I was
embarrassed of that You were so serious
about me figuring it out that I didn’t
want you to find out about my past and
give you any more reasons to doubt me --

JAKE
-- But --

HAYLIE
--I’m not done But what I realized this
weekend is that the reason you’re so
pushy about me making up my mind is
because you believe in me So you
wouldn’t have minded that I made a huge
mistake and got married for 24 hours
You wouldn’t have doubted me Like I
sometimes doubt myself

JAKE

I had no idea I was marrying a genius
HAYLIE

This being assertive thing is kinda

badass
He smiles and climbs in with her They spoon
JAKE
Now that you’re so into making decisions
will you help me with a big one

She turns towards him

JAKE (CONTD)
Will you still marry me But soon

She nods yes tears flowing

He pulls her in to him

PETEY

HARRY
So since the wedding fund is rendered
obsolete

They bring elaborate masquerade masks to their faces
