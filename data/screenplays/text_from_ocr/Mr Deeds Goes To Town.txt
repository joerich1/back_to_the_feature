the taxes it amounts to something in

him to fire Arthur

COBB

Arthur

LONGFELLOW

He was the last baby my father delivered
Arthur was

CEDAR

I think you ought to give this matter
some thought Mr Deeds

LONGFELLOW
Huh
CEDAR

I mean about the Power of Attorney

LONGFELLOW
Oh yes Yes I will

Cobb has stalled long enough to hear
Longfellows decision before he goes
out of the room

LONGFELLOW

Ill give it a lot of thought There

was a fellow named Winslow here a little
while ago wanted to handle my affairs
for nothing too It puzzles me why these
people all want to work for nothing

It isnt natural So I guess Id better
think about it some more

51 MEDIUM SHOT

Longfellow Cedar and the two tailors

TAILOR
Thats that

LONGFELLOW

You go to an awful lot of work to keep
a fellow warm dont you

TAILOR

a claim against the estate

(to butler)
Tell him to see me at my office
LONGFELLOW

Well if he has a claim wed better

(to butler)

Send him in

The butler disappears
CEDAR

Hes capable of causing you a lot of
trouble Mr Deeds

LONGFELLOW

How can he make any trouble for me
I havent done anything

The butler reappears followed by Hallor
The minute he appears Cedar speaks

up belligerently

CEDAR

I thought I told you to take up this
matter with me Hallor

52 MED CLOSE GROUP SHOT
HALLOR
Ima little tired of being pushed around

by you Mr Cedar - I dont care how

LONGFELLOW
(eyebrows raised)
Mrs Semple
HALLOR

Yes Your uncles common-law wife She
has a legal claim on the estate

CEDAR

Well let the courts decide what her
legal position is

HALLOR

You wouldnt dare go into court with

a case like this - and you know it

He turns to Longfellow who has listened
to them studyingly

HALLOR

I leave it to you Mr Deeds Can you
conceive of any court not being in sympathy
with any woman who gave up the best

years of her life for an old man like

your uncle

LONGFELLOW

What kind of wife did you say she was

HALLOR

Common-law wife On top of that theres
a child

LONGFELLOW
A child My uncles
HALLOR

Yes sir

LONGFELLOW

Thats awful The poor woman should
be taken care of immediately

HALLOR
(pleased)

Im glad to see youre willing to be
reasonable Mr Deeds

LONGFELLOW
If she was his wife she should have
all the money Thats only fair I dont

want a penny of it

He yanks his trousers off and hands
them to the tailor

CEDAR
Dont make any rash promises—

As the tailors exit Cobb returns

COBB

opera mob is about to break into the
Mad Song from Lucia2

INT BOARD ROOM
54 FULL SHOT

A group of eight distinguished-looking
men sit around a long table awaiting
Longfellows arrival At the head of
the table is a Mr Douglas
DOUGLAS

From what Im led to believe the young
mans quite childish I dont think
well have any difficulty in getting
him to put up the entire amount After
all its only a matter of 180000
CHORUS OF VOICES

A drop in the bucket for him

An excellent idea

Why not

DOUGLAS

(slyly)

You know gentlemen were really very
fortunate the young man is so sympathetic
toward music

(winking)

He plays the tuba in the town band

MAN

(who has been watching at door)
Here he comes

DOUGLAS

Good

There is a shuffle of preparation

INT DIRECTORS ROOM

55 SAME SCENE
With Longfellow and Cobb present Longfellow
looks around completely awed

DOUGLAS

Now gentlemen the first order of business
will be the election of a new Chairman
of the Board

A MAN

(rising)

As a sentimental gesture toward the
best friend opera ever had the late
Mr Semple I think it only fitting
that his nephew Mr Longfellow Deeds
should be made our next Chairman I
therefore nominate him

A VOICE

Second

DOUGLAS

All those in favor

EVERYBODY

DOUGLAS

58 MED CLOSE SHOT

Featuring Longfellow as he interrupts

LONGFELLOW

Wait a minute What does the Chairman
do

DOUGLAS

Why the Chairman presides at the meetings

LONGFELLOW

Thats what I thought If you dont
mind Im rather interested in the

report Id like to hear it
There is an uncomfortable shuffle For

a few minutes no one speaks From the
rear a tall man rises
362

59 CLOSE SHOT
Featuring treasurer
TREASURER

The treasurer reports a deficit of 180000
for the current year

60 CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW
He is stunned
LONGFELLOW

A deficit You mean weve lost that
much

61 WIDER ANGLE
To include all at table
DOUGLAS

You see Mr Deeds the opera is not
conducted for profit

LONGFELLOW

It isnt What is it conducted for

DOUGLAS

Why its an artistic institution—

LONGFELLOW

We own an opera house dont we
A VOICE

We do

LONGFELLOW

And we give shows
DOUGLAS
We provide opera
LONGFELLOW

But you charge I mean you sell tickets

VOICE

Of course
LONGFELLOW

And it doesnt pay
DOUGLAS

Thats impossible The opera has never
paid

LONGFELLOW
(conclusively)

Well then we must give the wrong kind
of shows

Cobb smiles The directors are stumped

62 MED CLOSE SHOT

Featuring Douglas and Longfellow

DOUGLAS

The wrong kind There isnt any wrong
or right kind Opera is opera

363
LONGFELLOW

I guess it is But I personally wouldnt
care to be head of a business that kept
losing money That wouldnt be common
sense Incidentally where is the 180000
coming from

DOUGLAS
Well we were rather expecting it to
come from you

LONGFELLOW
Me
DOUGLAS
Naturally
LONGFELLOW

Excuse me gentlemen theres nothing
natural about that

He is suddenly startled His ears prick
up

63 SHOT OF DIRECTORS

They all stare at Longfellow Over scene
comes the low wailing cry of a siren
which increases in volume as it gets
closer to the building

64 MEDIUM SHOT

Longfellow jumps up

LONGFELLOW

Hey a fire engine

He rushes to the window and peers out
The others stare unbelievably The shriek
of the siren finally dies down Longfellow
turns back

LONGFELLOW

(admiringly)

Gee that was a pip 4

(as he goes back to his seat)

We expect were going to have one like

that in Mandrake Falls pretty soon -
with a siren too
merchandise

There is a pause while he gets seated

LONGFELLOW

Now where were we

65 MED CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE
DOUGLAS

You see Mr Deeds the opera is not
conducted like any ordinary business

LONGFELLOW
Why not
DOUGLAS

Because it just isnt a business thats
all

364
LONGFELLOW

Well maybe it isnt to you but it
certainly is a business to me if I

have to make up a loss of 180000

If its losing that much money there
must be something wrong Maybe you charge
too much Maybe youre selling bad

Maybe lots of things I dont know
You see I expect to do a lot of good
with that money And I cant afford
to put it into anything that I dont
look into Thats my decision for the
time being gentlemen Goodbye and
thank you for making me Chairman

66 MED SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

He exits followed by Cobb whose eyes
shriek his admiration The directors
watch them leave flabbergasted Cobbs
head reappears in doorway

HALLOR
No I mean - about my client
LONGFELLOW

Oh - well have to do something about

Longfellows valet Walter enters and
holds up a full dress suit

WALTER

LONGFELLOW

wore one of those things in my life
WALTER

Hallor smiles feebly - his impatience
growing

HALLOR

Mrs Semple is entitled by law to one-third
of the estate

LONGFELLOW
(to Walter)

And dont ever get down on your knees
again understand

366

WALTER
No sir

LONGFELLOW

(to Hallor)

Excuse me What did you say
HALLOR

Mrs Semple is entitled to one-third
of the estate

LONGFELLOW

One-third Thats about 7000000 isnt
it

HALLOR

(quietly)

Well we didnt expect that much Im
sure I can get her to settle quietly

for one million

CEDAR

If theres any talk of settlement Hallor
take it up with me at the office

HALLOR

Ill do no such thing—

LONGFELLOW
Thats right Dont you go to his office

Theres only one place youre going
and thats out the door

Hallor looks up surprised
HALLOR

Youre making a mistake Mr Deeds

LONGFELLOW
Oh no Im not I dont like your face
Besides theres something fishy about
a person who would settle for a million
dollars when they can get seven million
Im surprised that Mr Cedar whos
supposed to be a smart man couldnt
see through that

HALLOR
Now wait a minute buddy—
69 MED SHOT

Longfellow crosses to bell cord and
pulls it

LONGFELLOW

Theres one nice thing about being rich
- you ring a bell and things happen
When the servant comes in Mr Hallor
Im going to ask him to show you to

it is

HALLOR

No use in getting tough Thatll get
you nowhere Mr Deeds

You know weve got letters

BUTLER
Yes sir
70 CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR

As Hallor gets to it Longfellow grabs
him by the shirt front and half lifts
him off the floor

LONGFELLOW
And listen there isnt any wife - there

arent any letters - and I think youre
a crook So you better watch your step

He shoves Hallor violently and he stumbles
out of scene Cobb enters to Longfellow
his hand extended

COBB

I cant hold out on you any longer
Lamb bites wolf

(shakes his head)

Beautiful

LONGFELLOW

Only common sense

71 MED SHOT

Cedar has been most uncomfortable through
the scene but now suavely assumes an
admiring attitude

CEDAR

(a forced smile)

I cant hold out any longer either
Mr Deeds

(holds out his hand)

Being an attorney for you will be a
very simple affair

LONGFELLOW

Youre not my attorney yet Mr Cedar
Not till I find out whats on your mind
Suppose you get the books straightened
out quick so I can have a look at them
CEDAR

Yes of course if you wish But you
must be prepared This sort of thing
will be daily routine

(picks up his hat)

If it becomes annoying you let me know

Goodbye Mr Deeds Goodbye sir

Longfellow shakes his hand Cedar exits
Longfellow stares after him disgustedly
wiping his hands with his handkerchief
LONGFELLOW

Even his hands are oily

Walter has entered and holds up a coat
for Longfellow

(to Brookfield)

I think your poems are swell Mr Brookfield
but Im disappointed in you I know

if you went to Mandrake Falls youd

look just as funny to us Only nobody

would laugh at you and make you feel
ridiculous - cause that wouldnt be

good manners

97 CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW
As he rises continuing
LONGFELLOW

a person whose incompetency and abnormality
we shall prove beyond any reasonable

doubt

269 PANNING SHOT OF SPECTATORS
CEDARS VOICE

I have before me a series of articles
written by a newspaper woman who was

an eye-witness to his conduct ever since
he came to New York

CAMERA STOPS on Babe and Mac Cedars
voice goes on

CEDAR

She tells how in the midst of a normal
conversation he would suddenly begin
playing his tuba She tells of his attacks
upon several of our eminent writers

- for no apparent reason In fact there
are many instances not recorded in these
articles in which Mr Deeds satisfied

an unnatural desire to smash people
up without provocation

270 MED SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM

CEDAR

I myself unable to keep pace with

his mental quirks and constantly fearful
of assault turned down an opportunity

to represent him as his attorney This
newspaper woman whom we have subpoenaed
to testify tells how he tied up traffic
for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor
horse And by his own statement waiting
for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee

438

There is laughter in the courtroom -
which quickly subsides when the Judge
pounds his gavel

CEDAR

We have photographs to substantiate

this little episode and other photographs
showing Mr Deeds jumping upon a fire
engine This scarcely sounds like the
action of a man in whom the disposition

of twenty million dollars may safely

be entrusted This writer of these articles
- a woman whose intelligence and integrity
in the newspaper world is unquestioned

- held him in such contempt that she

quite aptly named him The Cinderella
Man

271 CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW
CEDARS VOICE

We have witnesses here from Mandrake
Falls his own home town who will tell
of his conduct throughout his lifetime
proving that his derangement is neither
recent nor a temporary one

Longfellows interest is only slightly
aroused He lifts his eyes in a casual
glance around him
incapacitated

272 MED CLOSE SHOT
Featuring Cedar
CEDAR

We have others who will tell of his
unusual behavior when he invited the
great leaders of the musical world to
his home and then proceeded to forcibly
eject them Only recently when he was

in the County Hospital for observation
he not only refused to be examined by
these gentlemen the state psychiatrists
but he actually made a violent attack
upon them

273 CLOSE SHOT - THE JUDGE

As Cedar continues talking CAMERA PULLS
BACK to WIDER SHOT

CEDAR
In these times with the country

by economic ailments and endangered

with an undercurrent of social unrest
the promulgation of such a weird fantastic
and impractical plan as contemplated

by the defendant is capable of fomenting
a disturbance from which the country

may not soon recover It is our duty

to stop it Our government is fully

aware of its difficulties and can pull
itself out of its economic rut without
the assistance of Mr Deeds or any

other crackpot

274 MED PANNING SHOT

be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted

Thank you thats fine Do you see him

The two old ladies have their whispered
conference again

JANE

AMY

JUDGE

(irascibly)

Must we have the echo

CEDAR

Suppose you just answer Miss Jane

at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds

CEDAR

JANE

Pixilated
AMY

Uh-huh

CEDAR

(patiently)

Now thats a rather strange word to
use Miss Jane Can you tell the court

exactly what it means

While the two ladies go into a huddle

293 CLOSE SHOT - PSYCHIATRISTS

As one of them speaks up

PSYCHIATRIST

Perhaps I can explain Your Honor The
word pixilated is an early American
expression - derived from the word pixies
meaning elves They would say The
pixies had got him as we nowadays
would say a man is balmy

294 MEDIUM SHOT

The Judge nods his understanding The
Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement
Cedar sighs victoriously

CEDAR

Is that correct

JANE

Uh-huh

AMY

Uh-huh

JUDGE

Now tell me why does everyone think

hes - uh - pixilated Does he do peculiar
things
295 MED SHOT TOWARD WITNESS STAND

JANE
(after conferring with Amy)

He walks in the rain without his hat
and talks to himself

AMY

Sometimes he whistles
JANE

And sings

CEDAR

Anything else

JANE

Recently he gave Chuck Dillon a thumping

AMY

Blacked his eye

446

CEDAR

And why

JANE

For no reason I guess He always does
it We always run into the house when
we see him coming

AMY

Never can tell what hes going to do

JANE

He sure is pixilated
AMY

Oh yes - hes pixilated all right

CEDAR

And now Your Honor if the court pleases

- probably the greatest authority on

the subject in the world At present

he is in this country on a lecture tour

and has graciously volunteered his services
Dr Von Holler

While he is still speaking

DISSOLVE TO

302 WIDER ANGLE

As the clerk finishes swearing Dr Von
Holler in

CLERK

Do you solemnly swear the testimony
you are about to give in the cause now
pending before this court shall be the
truth the whole truth and nothing but
the truth so help you God State your
right name please

VON HOLLER

(a slight Austrian accent)

Emil Von Holler

CLERK

Take the stand

303 MED CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND

On Von Holler and Cedar

CEDAR

Now Dr Von Holler will you kindly

tell the court what your opinion is

on this case

VON HOLLER

This is purely a case of manic depression

In cases of this kind patients sometimes
go on for years before being detected

He turns to one of the psychiatrists
sitting with the Judge
VON HOLLER

You remember Dr Fosdick in my last
book there are some very fine examples

DR FOSDICK

(nodding)
Uh-huh
VON HOLLER

Especially the one of the young nobleman
you remember

DR FOSDICK

Oh yes Yes of course Dr Von Holler
Very interesting

VON HOLLER

It reminds me very much of this one
Nicht wahr

DR FOSDICK

Ja

VON HOLLER

It takes so long to detect them—

(to Judge)

—because their mood changes so often
and so quickly Now Your Honor may

I show you May I use the chart

449

JUDGE

By all means

He moves to a blackboard There are
chalk marks on it A straight line runs
diagonally across the center Other
lines run zig-zag over and below this
center line

VON HOLLER

(indicating chart)

Below here they are extremely depressed
melancholy impossible to live with

and often become violent

(cunning a line up)
From this mood the manic depressive
might gradually change until they reach
this state

(he reaches the center line)

Here is lucidity Here they are perfectly
normal As normal as you or I-

(smiling)

—assuming of course that we are normal

(he starts up with chalk)

Then the mood changes again until—

(chalk reaches top)
—they reach this state a state of highest
exaltation Here everything is fine

Here the world is beautiful Here they
are so elated - how do you express it

(quickly as it comes to him)

—they would give you the shirt off their
backs

CEDAR

Dr Von Holler how would you say that
applied to Mr Deedss case

VON HOLLER

The symptoms are obvious

(points to top line)

When he was here on top of the wave

he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth
toward his fellow-men He wanted them
around him So he decided he would give

a big reception But in the meantime

his mood has changed

(chalk goes down)
He is now at the bottom of the wave

- depressed - melancholy So when his
guests arrive he throws them out They
are now his imaginary enemies

304 CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW

As Von Hollers voice continues

VON HOLLERS VOICE

Other instances of high elation are
when he plays his tuba when he writes
his poetry when he chases fire engines
in his desire to help humanity This

is contrasted with his present mood
which is so low that even the instinct
for self-preservation is lacking

305 MED SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM
Von Holler still continues

VON HOLLER

Oh the man is verrukt Your Honor
this is decidedly a case of a manic
depressive

450

CEDAR

Thank you Dr Von Holler

Dr Von Holler returns to his seat

CEDAR

Your Honor we rest

306 FULL SHOT - COURTROOM

Longfellow is slumped in his seat head

COBB

(to the two experts)

You both concur

451

EXPERTS

(ad-lib)

Oh positively

The Judge emerges from his consultation
with his experts and addresses Longfellow
JUDGE

Mr Deeds in view of the extensive
testimony and your continued silence
and upon recommendation of the doctors
the Court considers it advisable for
your own safety that you be committed

to an institution as prescribed by law
You need medical attention Mr Deeds

(shrugs)
Perhaps in a little while—

Suddenly the air is rent with the shrill
voice of Babe

BABE
No No No Wait a minute

All are startled and look up Babe runs
right to the Judge

BABE

You cant do it Youve got to make
him talk

CEDARS VOICE
Your Honor I object

She turns directly to Longfellow - leaning
over close to him

315 CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW

BABE

Oh darling please I know everything

He must be made to defend himself before

JUDGE
Very well Take the stand

Babe goes up to the witness stand and
sits down

BABE

Oh thank you
452

CEDAR
(shouting)

Your Honor what she is saying has no
bearing on the case I object

JUDGE
Let her speak
BABE

That has a bearing on the case hasnt
it Hes been hurt Hes been hurt by
everybodys he met since he came here
principally by me Hes been the victim
of every conniving crook in town The
newspapers pounced on him - made him

a target for their feeble humor

fq

317 CLOSE SHOT - BABE
BABE

I was smarter than the rest of them

I got closer to him so I could laugh
louder Why shouldnt he keep quiet

Every time he said anything it was twisted

As she continues

BABE

He can thank me for it I handed the
gang a grand laugh This is a fitting
climax to my sense of humor

319 WIDER ANGLE

As Cedar protests

CEDAR

But Your Honor - this is preposterous

The Judge waves him down with a dismissing
gesture of his hand

BABE

Certainly I wrote those articles I

was going to get a raise - and a months
vacation But I stopped writing them
when I found out what he was all about
When I realized how real he was

320 CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW

As Babes voice continues

BABES VOICE

He could never fit in with our distorted
viewpoint because hes honest and sincere

- and good If that man is crazy Your

Cedar jumps up
CEDAR

Your Honor this is absurd The womans

BABE

Well you are in love with him arent
you

BABE

(shouting back)

Whats that got to do with it
CEDAR

(louder)

BABE

(just as loud)

322 CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW

To be intercut during her speech At
first he merely glances up at her

Finally he begins to show some interest

323 MED SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM
Cedar turns to the Judge
CEDAR

Your Honor her testimony is of no value
Why shouldnt she defend him Its a
tribute to American womanhood - the
instinct to protect the weak Im not
saying that nobody likes the boy I
cherish a fond affection for him myself
But that doesnt mean to say—
In the middle of his speech Mac - the
editor - appears at his elbow

MAC

When the windbag here gets through
Your Honor Id like to verify what
Miss Bennett said Im her editor When
she quit her job she told me what a
swell fellow this man was And anything
Babe Bennett says is okay with me

JUDGE

If you have anything to say you will
take the stand

MAC

Ive already said it Your Honor I
just thought Id like to get my two
cents in

As he starts to go CAMERA PANNING WITH
HIM he passes Longfellow He nudges
him

MAC

Dont be a sucker pal Stand up and
speak your piece

He disappears to his seat

finishes a dozen others are on their

CROWD

(ad-lib)

Yes What about us Mr Deeds

Youre not going to leave us out in

Theyre trying to frame you Mr Deeds
The turmoil is general with bailiffs
running to quiet them The Judge pounding

BAILIFFS VOICE

(when quiet reigns)

In the interest of Mr Deeds I have

329 CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND
Longfellow continues
LONGFELLOW

bout my playing the tuba Seems like

nto it cause there are a lot of tuba
layers running around loose Of course
dont see any harm in it I play mine

330 WIDER ANGLE
Front of courtroom
JUDGE

A what

LONGFELLOW

An O-filler You fill in all the spaces
in the Os with your pencil

(points to desk)
I was watching you

The Judge looks down at a paper in front
of him

INSERT OF A PRINTED DOCUMENT

Of some sort All the Os and Ps and
Rs have the white spaces pencilled
in

331 CLOSEUP - JUDGE
As he looks up from the document He

is a trifle self-conscious Laughter
comes from the courtroom
LONGFELLOWS VOICE

That may make you look a little crazy
Your Honor just sitting around filling
in Os - but I dont see anything wrong
cause that helps you to think Other
people are doodlers

JUDGE
Doodlers
456

332 MED SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM

LONGFELLOW

Thats a name we made up back home for
people who make foolish designs on paper
when theyre thinking Its called doodling
Almost everybodys a doodler Did you

ever see a scratch pad in a telephone
booth People draw the most idiotic

pictures when theyre thinking Dr

Von Holler here could probably think

up a long name for it because he doodles
all the time

Dr Von Holler who is in the middle
of some doodling flinches A roar of
laughter comes from the spectators
Longfellow reaches over to where Dr
Von Holler sits and picks up a piece
of paper

LONGFELLOW

(to Dr Von Holler)
Thank you

(returning to the stand)

This is a piece of paper he was scribbling
on

(scrutinizes it)

I cant figure it out One minute it
looks like a chimpanzee - and the next
twitcher

minute it looks like a picture of Mr
Cedar

(hands it to him)
You look at it Judge

The Judge with a serious mien takes
the paper

INSERT OF PAPER
It is a doodle face
BACK TO SCENE

Dr Von Holler is somewhat uncomfortable

LONGFELLOW

Exhibit A - for the defense

(after a pause)

Looks kind of stupid doesnt it Your
Honor But I guess thats all right

if Dr Von Holler has to doodle to help
him think Thats his business Everybody
does something different Some people
are—

(demonstrates)

ear-pullers - some are nail-biters—

(pointing)

That Mr Semple over there is a nose-

333 CLOSE SHOT - SEMPLE AND HIS WIFE

He looks up startled his nose twitching
more violently than ever The courtroom
rocks with laughter

His wife in her nervousness pulls
at her fingers
cracker

LONGFELLOWS VOICE

And the lady next to him is a knuckle-

Mrs Semple quickly drops her hands

in her lap as the courtroom again fills
with laughter

457

334 CLOSE SHOT - COBB

He swings a key-ring around his forefinger
Suddenly he realizes Longfellow might

get to him and he hastily palms the
keys and shoves them in his pocket

335 MED CLOSE SHOT - NEWSPAPER REPORTERS

One is leaning forward listening intently
- biting the end of his pencil The

one next to him nudges him and silently
points to the pencil in his mouth The
reporter gets the idea and smiling
sheepishly yanks it out of his mouth

336 MED CLOSE SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM

LONGFELLOW

So you see everybody does silly things
to help them think

(in conclusion)

Well I play the tuba
337 CLOSE SHOT - MAC

JUDGE

Mr Deeds do you recall forcibly ejecting
people from your home

LONGFELLOW

Oh yes Yes About my throwing those
people out of my house Mrs Pomponi
told the truth I did throw them out
because I didnt want the party in the
first place I didnt invite anybody
Mrs Pomponi did all that They just
came to see what kind of a freak the
Cinderella Man was I dont know how
people like that are supposed to act
Your Honor but if that Pomponi woman
is an example Ill stick to simple
folks She just came in talked my ear
off and took charge of everything

If I were a friend of hers Id have
her examined

342 MED SHOT OF COURTROOM

Featuring Longfellow Cedar who cannot
stand it any longer jumps to his feet
458
CEDAR

Your Honor this is becoming farcical
I demand that Mr Deeds dispense with
side remarks and confine himself to
facts Let him explain his wanderings
around the streets in underclothes
his feeding doughnuts to horses

JUDGES VOICE
Proceed
LONGFELLOW

Mr Cedars right Those things do look
kind of bad dont they But to tell

the truth Your Honor I dont remember
them I guess they happened all right
because I dont think a policeman would
lie about a thing like that but I was
drunk It was the first time I was ever
drunk in my life Its probably happened
to you some time I mean when you

were younger of course

The Judge clears his throat in embarrassment
Several women giggle The Judge sternly
pounds his gavel

343 CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW
LONGFELLOW

Its likely to happen to anybody Just
the other morning I read in the paper
about Mr Cedars own son - about how
he got drunk and insisted on driving

a taxi-cab while the driver sat inside
Isnt that so Mr Cedar Isnt that

so Mr Cedar

(after the usual conference)

Thats fine I guess maybe I am

(seriously)
Now tell me something Jane Who else
in Mandrake Falls is pixilated

is apparently a difficult thing to figure
out Finally they come out of it

JANE

Why everybody in Mandrake Falls in
pixilated - except us

AMY

352 CLOSE SHOT - BABE

She can scarcely conceal her elation

353 MED SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM

JUDGE

Mr Deeds you havent yet touched upon
a most important thing This rather
fantastic idea of yours to want to give
away your entire fortune It is to

say the least most uncommon

LONGFELLOW

Oh yes I was getting to that Your
Honor

CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSER SHOT featuring
Longfellow and Judge as former continues

LONGFELLOW

Suppose you were living in a small town
and getting along fine and suddenly
somebody dropped 20000000 in your
lap Supposing you discovered that all
that money was messing up your life
was bringing a lot of vultures around
your neck and making you lose faith

in everybody Youd be a little worried
wouldnt you Youd feel that you had

a hot potato in your hand and youd
want to drop it I guess Dr Von Holler
would say you were riding on—

(points to chart)

—those bottom waves cause you wanted
to drop something that was burning your
fingers

354 MEDIUM SHOT

Cedar springs to his feet

CEDAR

(shouting)

If this man is permitted to carry out

that will rock the foundations of our

entire governmental system

LONGFELLOWS VOICE

Its like the road out in front of my

house Its on a steep hill Every day
I watch the cars climbing up Some go

lickety-split up that hill on high—
357 FULL SHOT

LONGFELLOW

—some have to shift into second - and
some sputter and shake and slip back
to the bottom again Same cars - same
gasoline - yet some make it and some
dont And I say the fellows who can
make the hill on high should stop once
in a while and help those who cant
358 MEDIUM SHOT

LONGFELLOW

(making his point)

Thats all Im trying to do with this
money Help the fellows who cant make
the hill on high

359 CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW
LONGFELLOW

with it Give it to him - and a lot

See all those fellows Theyre the ones
Im trying to help They need it

(pointing)

Mr Cedar and that Mr Semple dont

need anything Theyve got plenty Its
like Im out in a big boat and I see

one fellow in a rowboat whos tired

of rowing and wants a free ride - and
another fellow whos drowning Who would
you expect me to rescue Mr Cedar

who just got tired of rowing and wants

a free ride Or those men out there

who are drowning Any ten-year-old child
will give you the answer to that

(to farmers etc in courtroom)

All right fellows Thank you Sit down

362 MEDIUM SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM

LONGFELLOW

Now my plan is very simple I was going
to give each family ten acres - a horse
a cow and some seed And if they work
the farm for three years its theirs
Now if thats crazy maybe I ought

to be sent to an institution But I
dont think it is And whats more

Mr Cedar doesnt either

(vehemently)

Just before the hearing started he
offered to call the whole thing off

if I made a settlement with him So
you see he wouldnt think I was crazy
if he got paid off
363 CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR

He jumps to his feet highly incensed

CEDAR

stupid in my life

Longfellows eyes narrow resentfully
