THE BODYGUARD

Written by LAWRENCE KASDAN

Clean Shooting Draft

February 1992

FOR EDUCATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY

SCREEN IS BLACK

In the darkness we hear dripping water the echoing
approach of two sets of footsteps There is the sound of
a sudden quick scuffle a heavy fall of bodies

THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS Two from one gun one from
another So fast and close theyre barely distinguish-
able The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete
walls and dies away Silence

SLOW SLOW FADE IN

1 INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT

FRANK FARMERS FACE -
mid to late 30s peers intently over a smoking gun He
is The Bodyguard
ANGLE - HIT MAN
dead on his feet leans against a car A gun drops
heavily from his hand His life ebbs as he slides slowly
down the car door to his knees then falls forward face
down on the cement floor
A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of
KLINGMAN Protectively pressed body to body on the
filthy cement floor of the garage Klingman a handsome
50-year-old arbitrageur gasps in barely controlled fear
as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil There
is no movement
The two men are lying near the right front fender of a
black limousine Blood spreads from the body of the hit
man a few yards away Klingman starts to raise himself
up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor still
alert for any further threat
MAIN TITLES BEGIN
A beat and VOICES are heard OS Farmer wheels snub-
nosed 357 aimed at them

FRANK

Freeze
2A

ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE

A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks Farmer
lowers his weapon and speaks
FRANK
(calm but an order)
Call 911

CAMERA has CRANED UP TO a high almost-frozen WIDE SHOT of
the scene It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness

EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom
Inside behind the reflections of the city lights all
the TV sets are showing the same picture the glittering
image of a woman singing (We will recognize the woman
as Rachel Marron) We cut tighter and tighter on the
image until it is almost broken up into its scanning
lines Through the city noise comes the sound of her
song I have Nothing

INT DANS APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT

A battered old desk Scattered across the top -- a pile
of blank white paper a jar of glue a stack of
magazines a pair of scissors a TV remote control
softly in the bg a TV is playing the same image we saw
in the store window the same song

Hands appear Male hands They open a drawer and remove

a pair of translucent rubber gloves Carefully they put the
gloves on The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound
The hands pick a magazine off the stack Screen Stars
They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors A
headline on the cover reads RACHEL MARRONS GREATEST
TRIUMPH The scissors start to cut Meticulously they
excise the name RACHEL MARRON from the page With the
care of a surgeon

EXT HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE - NIGHT

A tumultuous crash of screaming pushing bodies Arms
stretch out cameras flash sunguns flare microphones
are thrust forward A deafening cacophony of Rachel
Rachel Rachel Over here Over here This way

Rachel Rachel Rachel We cannot see the object of
this frenzy We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive
well-dressed young woman (NICKI) exiting with the other
celebrities as she is pushed and casually jostled aside
by the mass of surging fans and media Her face is calm

2A
and impassive as she watches from the sidelines

INT KLINGMANS OFFICE DEN - NIGHT 5
In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint-
ings that reflect Klingmans success as an arbitrageur

he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer

KLINGMAN

Your hands ever shake Frank

FRANK

Sometimes Its just adrenaline

KLINGMAN
How did you know

FRANK

I saw him washing the car
KLINGMAN

I saw him
FRANK

They dont wash cars on the
parking levels
He hands a glass of brandy to Frank who looks at it
KLINGMAN
You know Id like you to stay on
He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank
FRANK
Im not good in permanent
positions my feet go to sleep
The two men smile at each other They raise their glasses
in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks Frank doesnt

INT DARKENED ROOM - DESK TOP - NIGHT 6
The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word TIME onto
a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom
note Each word has been cut from a different page and
is in a different typeface The note is being assembled
with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance
and is quite easy to read It reads
MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
I HAVE NOTHING THE TIME TO DIE IS

EXT CHARITY CONCERT - EVENING 7
A blur of hands and faces Excited fans Pieces of paper
autograph books notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA
Again a mass chanting Rachel Rachel Rachel

Hands of Rachels entourage accept some of the proffered
items

In CLOSEUP we see Rachels hands signing Best wishes

Rachel Marron on an out-stretched open palm In the
midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper a be-
ribboned black doll is thrust forward bearing the legend
RACHEL WE LOVE YOU

EXT FRANK FARMERS HOUSE - EVENING

SLAM of a CAR DOOR Frank gets out of a cab with two
suitcases His house is a modest stucco affair ona
small lot He goes up the walk and puts down his suit-
cases He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass
Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep He picks up a
few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket A
curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain As the
door opens we are aware of a further pile of mail
inside Franks feet push the letters aside and go
inside The door shuts

INT FARMERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table
in a breakfast nook A bottle of red wine is open with a
glass beside it

At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and
reads a Time magazine He adds a splash of wine He
lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat
At the table he looks at the place setting and absently
eats another piece of meat Finally he sets the pot on
the plate and eats from it directly while glancing
through the magazine

INT DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE
Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room
Theres a loud buzz of excited chatter Hands are stack-
ing flowers good luck messages cards and cables by the
mirror Through the blur and bustle we glimpse the doll
with its embroidered ribbon message RACHEL WE LOVE YOU
Hands casually move it to one side among the flowers
resting on the small portable TV set On the screen is
an image of Rachel performing on stage acknowledging
applause bowing

The doll EXPLODES SHATTERING the TV the MIRROR and the
LIGHT BULBS

The SCREEN GOES BLACK amid SHOUTS SCREAMS and
CONFUSION

TITLES END

EXT FRANK FARMERS HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree sun-
glasses on a glass of iced tea by his side Strains of
DONT WALK AWAY RENEE come from a beat-up transistor
RADIO

An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back
and forth over the freshly cut grass Throwing knives
lay scattered nearby A wooden post is sticking out of
the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard
BILL DEVANEY fiftyish a distinguished-looking black
gentleman stands nearby trying to engage Frank ina
conversation that up to this point hasnt been going well
Hes Rachels personal manager
DEVANEY
So you wont protect Rachel Marron
just because shes in show business
FRANK
I dont do celebrities
DEVANEY

But the biggest moneys in show

business people
Frank says nothing His eyes are closed behind the sun-
glasses Devaney picks up one of the throwing knives
He holds it carefully by the blade and throws it It
misses the post by three feet and clatters against the
fence
Frank opens his eyes sees whats going on and closes his
eyes again

DEVANEY
(picking up another
knife)
Do you really do these things
FRANK
Isnt she the one who collects
dolls
This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing
DEVANEY
(exasperated)

Farmer Rachel Marron is one of the
most famous people in America Shes
won every music award invented Shes
got the number one song in the country
right now and shell probably be
nominated for an Oscar in her very

first picture And you want to know
Isnt she the one Christ
man whereve you been

FRANK
You mean she doesnt collect dolls

DEVANEY
(defeated)
Yes She collects dolls
FRANK
I thought I knew who she was
Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or
not Franks face betrays nothing Devaney gestures with
a knife
DEVANEY
Youre probably deadly with these
things arent you

FRANK
Deadly
DEVANEY
Show me
Frank doesnt move
DEVANEY

Why are you resisting this job
2000 bucks a week
(no response)
2500
FRANK
There are several good men
available for that kind of money
Have you talked to Fitzgerald or
Racine Portman
DEVANEY
Yeah Portman was interested
He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what
he takes to be the first serious talk
DEVANEY
but were told youre the best
FRANK
Theres no such thing
DEVANEY
Farmer were talking about a
very frightened lady With a

seven-year old son Believe me
I wouldnt be here if I didnt
think this was for real
(long pause)
Farmer she begged me to get you
Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time
He picks up five throwing knives and stands up
FRANK
All right Ill come and Ill look
the situation over If I take it
its three thousand a week
(w

Okay You

for three

Frank is now about

DEVANEY
histles)
must be very deadly
grand a week

twenty feet from the wooden post He

throws one of the knives It misses the post and
clatters against the fence
FRANK
Shit
Devaneys face drops Frank examines the next knife
FRANK
(mumbling)

I know its something like
The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc
and disappears into some bushes about three feet from
Devaney Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind
Frank

FRANK

Sorry
Frank raises his hand to throw again
motions Devaney off to the side

FRANK

Better not stand right behind me
Devaney smiles weakly Frank lets the third knife go
with one smooth motion
The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post THUMP
Franks hand arching again Throwing the remaining knives
Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical
line with the first one

then stops and

13 EXT MARRON ESTATE - WAVERLY LANE (BEL AIR) - DAY

Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street
from the closed unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron
driveway

FRANKS POV

as he looks over the gate the wall
and the rising grounds beyond
(NOTE The use of the term FRANKS POV is not to be
taken simply as a camera direction Rather it re-
presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in
the special way Frank sees Frank lives by constant
vigilance heightened awareness It is his genius and
his burden The audience must be put in the position of
looking searching scanning with him)
He has a curious sense of being watched a kind of prick-
ling on the back of his neck As he looks around a

black Toyota 4X4 parked some way down the road drives
rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look He watches

the heavy vegetation

it go
Frank pulls up to the gate and gets out of his car He
grabs a bar of the gate and pulls The whole gate
rattles Frank gets back in his car and pushes a button
on the intercom box at the side of the gate A MANS
VOICE CRACKLES out of the BOX Transmission is terrible
MANS VOICE (VO)
Yes
FRANK
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron
MANS VOICE (VO)

What

FRANK
Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss
Marron

MANS VOICE (VO)
(obviously has not heard)
Have you got an appointment
FRANK
The atomic number of zinc is 30
MANS VOICE (VO)
All right
There is a LOUD BUZZING and the gate swings arthritically
open

EXT MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

FRANKS POV

as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land-
scaped grounds Plenty of potential hiding places The
mansion is at the top of the hill The grounds behind
the mansion fall away

EXT MANSION - CIRCULAR DRIVEENTRANCE AREA - DAY
The mansion is huge On and on it goes Frank drives
PAST the garage area where HENRY the chauffeur is
polishing the mascot on the limousine One of his arms
is bandaged Henry peers at Frank puts down his cloth
and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking
Frank gets out looks around A painters truck is
parked nearby two painters unloading equipment from it
HENRY
Can I help you
FRANK
Are you the man on the intercom
HENRY
No Can I help you
FRANK
My name is Edison I have an

appointment with Miss Marron

HENRY
Oh And that was arranged by
FRANK
(impressed)
Mr Devaney
HENRY
Go right ahead Mr Edison
FRANK
What happened to your arm
HENRY

(looking at his arm)
A doll
He goes back to the limousine
Frank RINGS the DOORBELL although the door is not shut
EMMA a fiftyish housekeeper appears A man in cover-
alls comes out past her carrying a length of timber

FRANK

Henry Ford to see Mr Devaney
EMMA

Come in please

INT MARRON MANSION - DAY
Frank steps into the foyer with Emma She is a warm
matronly woman who does a fine job running the house
without standing on custom
EMMA

Ill tell you quite honestly

Mr Ford I dont know where

Mr Devaney is Did he say hed

be here
FRANK
Yes
EMMA
Then he probably is Let me look

She leads Frank into a large unused formal parlor There
are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being
repainted On a number of TV screens scattered around
Rachels latest video (the one we saw in the opening
titles) is continuously playing The sound of the song
itself -- I HAVE NOTHING -- comes softly from concealed
speakers
EMMA

Please make yourself at home Can

I get you anything
Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer
Frank watches her go then moves off into the house in

the opposite direction Its obviously undergoing a
major redecoration Painters decorators and designers
come and go oblivious to Franks presence

INT MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY
The deeper Frank walks into the house the warmer and
more lived-in rooms appear

INT MARRON MANSION - SUN ROOM - DAY
Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool
area One wall is all glass On the opposite wall are

shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marrons career

A Tony award three Grammys gold and platinum records
other statuettes and plaques Among the framed photo-
graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc is one of her and

her small son FLETCHER dressed in a tuxedo Both are
goofing off for the camera with obvious affection Frank
looks down at the pool

FRANKS POV

Dwarfed by the pool the only person in sight is seven-
year old Fletcher the little boy from the photograph
dark-haired and fragile He is crouched at the side of
the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long
speedboat which is cutting across the water A nanny
sits some way off embroidering

Franks attention is distracted A heavier BASS MUSICAL
BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house another
Rachel Marron number but this time up-tempo and bouncy
Frank follows the sound

INT FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is
coming from

It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating a
bar a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth It

is packed with people props and video equipment There
is lots of activity a general air of barely-organized
chaos MUSIC BLARES out

A group of six dancers is rehearsing an energetic dance
number for a music video directed by their choreographer
RORY Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the
glass wall at the end of the room A video cameraman
circles them taping the rehearsal which appears on a
large-screen TV behind them

In one corner a pretty black girl is being pinned into a
proposed costume for the video Several people are stand-
ing around tending to the video and playback gear All
the chairs face the far end of the room and it isnt

immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among
the big cushions

As Frank sits on the barstool at the back a large swivel
chair turns to reveal Devaney He waves to Frank and

makes his way over to him

On the other side of the room a brawny heavyset man in his
late thirties rises to look at Frank He has a twenty inch
neck Devaney signals to him that everything is all right
The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more then sits down
Frank looks around the room A shelf laden with vitamins
Guitars of various makes A flute A gold record being

used as a coaster People smoking and chatting through

the rehearsal

In one of the chairs a pretty woman in her mid-thirties
(NICKI the woman we saw at the premiere) is knitting
She glances occasionally at the dancers A man sits next
to a phone busily discussing a contract with someone at
the other end of the line

The music climaxes and abruptly stops The dancers hold
their dramatic final poses for a second then relax again
APPLAUSE The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest
Then LAUGHTER

From elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO
DIRECTOR

DIRECTOR (0S)
Playback everybody
Rachels voice comes from the sofa
RACHEL (0S)
Come here Rory
The choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from
sight Sound of kissing laughter
The video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather
round it expectantly
RACHEL (0S)
Sugar thats gonna be great I
love the ending
Devaney moves to the front of the room The PLAYBACK
STARTS behind him There are several overlapping
conversations going on
DEVANEY
Rachel
RACHEL (0S)
Nicki howd you like the number
You like the end routine
DIRECTOR (0S)
Rachel You wanna see it back

ending
NICKI responds to Rachels question
NICKI
It was just great Rory
But Rachel is already replying to the video director

RACHEL (0S)
I wanna see it all Tony Ill
bet Tony loved it
The brawny man Tony shrugs and stands to look at Frank
as he speaks

TONY
Ehh
RACHEL (0S)
Dont worry Rory Tony doesnt
appreciate great art
The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachels
approval elbowing Devaney a little to one side

DRESS DESIGNER
(showing the costume)

DEVANEY

RACHEL (0S)

DEVANEY

Devaney is now facing the unseen Rachel

DEVANEY

Devaney nods in Franks direction Nicki looks at Frank

RACHEL (0S)

DEVANEY
Frank Farmer
(getting no response)
The bodyguard
RACHEL (0S)
I think Rory should be my
bodyguard
(to dress designer)
Lets see the back again
DEVANEY
Rachel raise your butt out of
there and meet this man
RACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa Its a bit of

a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old
A young woman Not beautiful not ugly Unique only in
that she is immediately interesting A Superstar
RACHEL
Well Im up

Rachel and Frank look across the room at each other
Frank comes forward

DEVANEY
Frank Farmer Rachel Marron
Rachel offers her hand and they shake Rachel looks him
up and down
RACHEL
You dont look like a bodyguard
FRANK
What did you expect
RACHEL
I dont know Tough guy maybe
FRANK

RACHEL
(smiling)
Well his timings good
DEVANEY

This is Nicki Rachels sister
and personal secretary
NICKI
Nice to meet you Mr Farmer
DEVANEY
(indicating)
Tony Scibelli
Tony nods but makes no move to shake hands
Rachel dismisses the Dress Designer
RACHEL
(to designer)
The backs still not right
SPECTOR still on the phone offers a perfunctory wave
DEVANEY
Sy Spector Rachels publicist

RACHEL
Can we get you a drink
FRANK
Orange juice
RACHEL
Straight Nicki

Nicki goes to the bar Rachel sits and motions for
Frank to sit opposite her
RACHEL
Rory Ill be with you in a second
Rory gets up and goes over to his dancers at the big
screen video

RACHEL
Listen this whole thing is Bills
idea This sudden obsession with

protecting me Tony has always
handled my security and weve done
just fine

SPECTOR (0S)

(into the phone)

Yes Ill hold but not long

RORY (0S)
Rachel you want to run through
your steps before we go again

RACHEL
Ill be with you in a second
Nicki hands Frank his orange juice She looks at Frank as
she speaks
NICKI

I think Bills right Rachel Its
time you took more precautions
Spector enters the conversation
SPECTOR
(one hand covers
the phone)
Nicki Im sure Mr Farmer would
tell you the number of nuts
writing fan letters jumps every
time Rachel is on the cover of
a magazine
DEVANEY
Not like this

An ASSISTANT hands Rachel a small sheaf of phone messages
some papers for signature and a pen Rachel checks
through them and signs as she talks
RACHEL
Relax guys I said Id do it You
see what Im dealing with here
Im willing to go along as long
as we all understand each other
Im not going to let this alter
my life one little bit
(to assistant)
Who was this
ASSISTANT

(overlapping Devaney)
Oh That was Clives office
They called three times
DEVANEY
Honey thats not going to be a
problem
DEVANEY (CONTD)
(to Frank)
Rachel runs a very informal
household were all ona first
name basis
Spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in
SPECTOR
-And Im sure youll blend in
just fine You can select whatever
alarm systems you want for the
house Some kind of improved
security for the gate What else
Rachel
Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and
the dancers
Frank looks at Devaney Devaney doesnt like the tone
this is taking
RACHEL
I think Im safe when Im here at
the house so I guess the main thing
will be when I go out Tony will
be able to fill you in on all that
You two will have to work something
out I dont want both of you
falling all over me everywhere I
go The most important thing is
this -- I will not allow Fletcher
to be affected by this thing

Rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her

starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion

SPECTOR
(punching phone)
I was just going to cover that
Well have to tell the child you
have some other function

RACHEL
I dont want him to think hes in
prison So the house and grounds

must not be altered in any way
He shouldnt be aware that youre
here Is that clear

Frank looks at her a long time glancing up at Devaney

once

FRANK
Miss Marron

RACHEL
Rachel

FRANK

Theres been a mistake A
misunderstanding If youll show
me the quickest way out well
save each other a lot of trouble

Franks on his way Someone brings a silver headpiece on
a stand to Rachel She ignores it still looking at Frank

TONY

You can go past the pool
DEVANEY

Shut up Tony
FARMER

Nice meeting you
DEVANEY

Farmer will you wait a minute
SPECTOR

Bill I dont think we should be
begging this guy for his services
DEVANEY

Sy Im handling this

Rachel looks on coolly as Frank slides open the glass door

DEVANEY
Farmer will you wait a minute

EXT MARRON GROUNDS - BACK LAWN - DAY
Frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall down
the slope Devaney is scurrying to keep up

DEVANEY
Farmer will you wait a minute I
should have told you more Im
sorry but I was afraid she wouldnt
go through with it I thought Id
let the two of you work it out
come to an understanding

FRANK
We did
Frank starts to walk off Devaney is grasping at straws
DEVANEY

Shes not a bad person and whether
she knows it or not she needs you
(a beat)

Youve come this far Would you
just wait here for one minute I
want to show you something Please
Farmer

Devaney runs back to the house

21 EXT POOL AREA - DAY

Fletcher happy to have someone to talk to walks up to
Frank with his remote-control speed boat Frank would
like to walk away but Fletcher blocks his way Frank

looks at Fletchers frail little nut-brown figure The

watching nanny continues her embroidering some way off

FLETCHER

Hi
FRANK

(continuing to walk)

Hi
FLETCHER

How are you today
FRANK

(wants to keep walking)
All right How bout yourself
FLETCHER
Oh Im fine Do you like boats

Frank gives up Hes not going to get out of here
stops
FRANK
No I dont like boats
FLETCHER
You dont Why not
FRANK
Oh I dont know
FLETCHER
Sure you do but you dont want
to tell me

Frank considers him then slips out of his sport coat
He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher
FRANK
Youre a smart kid
Fletcher nods
FRANK
Ill tell you One time I was
stuck on a boat with some people
for four months
FLETCHER
A lifeboat
FRANK
Nope A big white yacht Do you

He
know what a yacht is

FLETCHER
(thinks about this)
Yeah My mom rented this huge
yacht once and we took a trip
It was great Everyone threw up
except me I love ‘em
FRANK

(standing to leave)
Well nobodys perfect

Fletcher squints up at him the sun in his eyes

FLETCHER
Youre the bodyguard arent you

Frank is surprised

FRANK
What do you know about it

FLETCHER
Ive got ears
FRANK
Ill remember that
Devaney trots into the pool area out of breath He is
holding a bulging manila file As he sees Fletcher he
holds the file casually at his side
Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file
DEVANEY
How are you Fletch
(to Frank)
Im glad you waited Lets go
over here
FRANK
(to Fletcher)
Nice meeting you
Fletcher looks after them silently

EXT PATIO - DAY
Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank open-
ing it Inside are letters of every size and condition
Repeatedly throughout this scene Franks gaze is drawn to
Fletcher who has started his boat again
DEVANEY
This is just in the last six months
FRANK
(looks at the pile)
Have you ever tried having these
professionally assessed
Devaney shakes his head no
Frank begins to look through the letters flipping them by
the corner of the page From many different sources some

are scrawled some typed some assembled from cutouts
Many are soiled and torn others immaculate Occasionally
one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it
Spector enters sucking on a popsicle He comes to stand
over Franks shoulder peering nonchalantly at the piles
of letters
SPECTOR

Devaney says you were in the Secret

Service
Frank nods

Frank goes through them quickly with an expert eye He
sometimes pauses to read one more carefully A few he
removes from the stack and places in the center of the

table
SPECTOR
Ever guard the main man
FRANK
I was two years with Carter and
four years with Reagan
Frank sets another letter in the center pile He stops

smiling at it

FRANK
This is a little old lady in
Akron Shes written to
everybody Ive ever worked for

He continues to turn until something stops him Several
letters are paper-clipped together They are the pasted-
up type we saw being assembled on the desk top

SPECTOR
Reagan got shot

His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank

FRANK
Not on my shift

Spector emits a gratuitous laugh acknowledges the joke

SPECTOR
Thats good

Frank goes back to his letters He taps the stack in
the center of the table

FRANK
At first glance these dont
bother me But keep them You
never know

He separates one letter from the others

FRANK
This could be something

Devaney searches Franks face

DEVANEY

You think it could be the same
guy The one who rigged the doll

FRANK
I dont know Did you tell Miss
Marron about it Does she know
about the doll
Devaney and Spector exchange looks This is evidently a
sore point between them

SPECTOR
We said thered been some electrical
problem while she was on stage
Short circuit Look she doesnt
need that kind of worry right now
It would upset her
FRANK
What about the police
SPECTOR
There was no reason for the police
No one got hurt
FRANK
What about the chauffeur

SPECTOR
It was nothing It was just our
people there

Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool Devaneys
eyes are still on Franks face
DEVANEY
Sy I think we should show him
the room

INT ROOM - DAY

Frank follows Spector and Devaney into the room He

glances around taking in the murals the decor the
kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from
the pages of a tabloid layout

FRANK
Is this her bedroom

SPECTOR
Yes

DEVANEY

No She sleeps in a room next to

Fletchers down the hall Sy had

this done for a magazine layout
SPECTOR

Superstars in their Boudoirs

Did you see it
FRANK
No
DEVANEY

Rachel never liked it

SPECTOR
She didnt have to like it
Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed
DEVANEY
We found the letter here

FRANK
Somebody was in here
DEVANEY
Somebody broke in and
masturbated on the bed
FRANK
And she doesnt know about this
either
Devaney shakes his head
SPECTOR
Are you kidding This would really
freak her out
DEVANEY
What do you think
FRANK
Someone penetrates the house gets
upstairs and jerks off on the bed
Id say that qualifies as a

problem
DEVANEY
What kind of problem
SPECTOR
(agitated)
Of fuck we dont need this now
FRANK
This house is wide open
SPECTOR
Excuse me
FRANK

I said this house is wide open

and you people have no clue what
real security is or what it takes

to achieve it
DEVANEY

(does a quick read

on Frank)
Frank I totally respect what
youre telling me Tell me how
you want to work and Ill
accommodate you

FRANK

Look I cant protect her I wont
be responsible for her safety if
she doesnt know whats going on

DEVANEY
Ill talk to her Ill make her
understand I can do that
SPECTOR
No Ill talk to her
Spector exits the room in a huff

EXT MARRON HOUSE FRONT - DAY
Frank emerges with Devaney and crosses toward his car
DEVANEY
She wont give you any static
Frank youve got my word on that
Frank is still focused on Fletcher
FRANK
Sure she will
DEVANEY
So what jobs perfect Youre
a bodyguard arent you
Slowly Frank faces him

FRANK
(quietly)
Yeah
As they reach the car Devaney is relieved He dares a
perfect smile
FRANK

Devaney if you ever lie to me
again Ill take you apart

INT MARRON MANSION - FRANKS ROOM - DAY

As she speaks some workmen test the remote control on a
window shutter It descends in front of Rachels face
She is not amused Fletcher passes Frank on his way to

WOMAN Frank stands nearby with Nicki The Woman says
something to Rachel who turns and looks at Frank
Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both
laugh They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance

WOMAN
(an afterthought
phony)
Goodbye Nicki So great to see you
Nicki waves and follows Rachel Frank stays very close
without seeming to walk with Rachel

A little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel
Rachel glances at Frank who has stopped with her then
she signs an autograph for the girl The girls mother
close behind her hands a small camera casually to Nicki
to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with
Rachel Frank watches Nicki quietly comply
Rachel Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance
together and Frank slips out first glancing around
Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him
RACHEL

street Tony stares at him uncomprehending
TONY
(impatiently)
Hey lets go
Frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat
next to Tony
FRANK
(across Tony)
OK Henry lets go
Tony looks at Frank eyes narrowing
From across the street we see the limo pull away As
the shot clears the dark shape of another vehicle
appears Slowly moving into frame over the top of the
camera

INT FRONT SEAT OF LIMO - DAY
Frank sits beside Tony next to the door Tony speaks
to him in a near whisper
TONY
Let me set you straight on a few
things For starters I love this

While Tony speaks Franks eyes dart to the side mirror

The car slows
ANGLE - SPECTOR AND RACHEL IN BACK

SCREECHING left turn disappearing behind them

EXT MARRON ESTATE - DAY 41

large fence

and work area

ANGLE - TONY RACHEL AND SPECTOR

As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across
the property

TONY
Whats with him

EXT MARRON ESTATE - DAY 43
As Frank comes through some bushes he suddenly catches a
glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees It starts to
accelerate
As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license
number) he breaks into a full run toward the other end
of the property
Leaping hedges Frank crashes through tropical vegetation
CRASHING through a bamboo forest he scurries down a
steep wooded slope toward the road below The 4 X 4 can
be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off

A retaining wall about 14 feet high rises from the road
to the slope Without a pause as the car speeds beneath
Frank leaps and drops the full distance to the road The
4 X 4 ROARS PAST just missing him and turns a corner
Hitting hard Frank allows his knees to take the force of
the fall deliberately rolling once before he springs

into a crouched upright position

But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone

INT MARRON ESTATE - DAY 44
The fortification continues as workmen tighten screws
install electrical wiring test alarms As Frank watches
over the work we see him show Henry how to wear a SURV
KIT communications system

expectantly

EXT MARRON ESTATE POOLSIDE - DAY 45
Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the

hill Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where

Walkman

There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from
the direction of the house Rachel jumps up and yells
toward the house

RACHEL

Shut up you assholes

INT RACHELS BEDROOM - DAY 46
A mild-looking OLD LOCKSMITH is working on Rachels
window Rachel walks in from the pool starting to
peel off the swimsuit She stops startled as she sees
him This is the last straw She blows up
RACHEL
(clutching the
swimsuit)
You You Out Out Now Out

Terrified the Old Locksmith drops his tools and begins

backing out of the room
OLD LOCKSMITH
Yes maam Thank you Ima real
fan of yours Miss Marron
Still angry but disarmed Rachel makes a face
RACHEL
Then you can take your tools with you
She turns to the window in what she imagines is
Franks general direction and like a little girl
suddenly sticks out her tongue

EXT MARRON ESTATE - GATEGUARD HOUSE - DAY

In a BIG CLOSEUP ON a black and white TV screen we see
Devaneys immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it
roars up the drive Frank Henry and Fletcher watch in
the newly-erected guard house The area is greatly
changed There is a uniformed guard with an impressive
array of switches lights and phones at his command
There are several TV screens one of them shows a series
of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of

the grounds On the other the Mercedes kicks up dust
from the last few curves in the drive Fletcher shakes
his head Hes seen it all before
HENRY

FLETCHER
(to Frank)

hurries inside

Rory sniggers into the back of Rachels hair fighting
off a laugh Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight
face too Spector glares at them as Frank enters from
the sliding door
SPECTOR

Rachel turns ON the BLENDER drowning out Nickis voice
Frank looks at Rachel coolly She stares at him
petulantly then turns OFF the BLENDER

RACHEL
Do you know hes got the phones
bugged

SPECTOR
Oh Jesus Bill

RACHEL

DEVANEY

(interrupting)

Rachel turns ON the BLENDER and stares at Frank

EXT THRIFT SHOP - VALLEY - DAY 48a
Rachels limousine is parked opposite the shop Its

a decidedly downscale area A little way off a group

of unemployed youths hang around eyeing the limo with
interest Henry sits at the wheel Tony stands by the

open window leaning against the car

HENRY
(looking at the
youths)
I wish Rachel didnt keep coming

Rachel is shopping for bargains moving along racks of
discarded clothing

RACHEL
Louise youve got too much great
stuff

OWNER

(from the back of
the shop laughing)
Take it all darlin’
Frank leans casually against a wall not watching Rachel
but watching the shop watching the street outside
Rachel finds something she likes
RACHEL
Wooo Let me try this on
She flicks a glance to Frank hes not looking at her
She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing
booth then stops dramatically

RACHEL
(to Frank indicating
the open booth)

Farmer do you want to come in

here with me Just to be safe
Frank glances at her then resumes his surveillance of
the shop Rachels head bobs up and down above the
curtain as she changes

RACHEL

You probably wont believe this

but I have a reputation for being

a bitch
Frank says nothing He gazes outside through the store-
front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next
to the limo A few small boys stand around the car One
of them is climbing onto the hood
RACHEL

I didnt used to be But you get

known for being a certain way --

a way people think you are -- and

pretty soon you get like that

Cant help it
Frank smiles knowingly Rachel notices

RACHEL
You dont think so Youre such
an expert on famous people

FRANK
Ive seen a few
RACHEL
And you disagree
FRANK
(very flat)

You can be as you choose to be

Its an act of discipline

sometimes but it can be done
Rachel stops in her tracks then opens the curtains and
looks at herself in the mirror Also reflected in the
mirror is Frank

RACHEL

That why you never stay with one

of your clients They too

undisciplined for you Or is it

youre afraid youll start to

care about them

FRANK
(without interest)
Thats right
Rachel turns to Frank
RACHEL
Cant you answer straight just
once Why dont you talk to

me Im not such a bad lady
FRANK

Youre too clever for me I cant
keep up

Frank continues to search the shop and street with his
gaze Rachel steps closer to him

RACHEL
Look at me Farmer

Frank turns and looks at her

RACHEL
You dont approve of me do you
FRANK
Disapprovals a luxury I cant
afford Gets in the way
RACHEL
Dont like emotions getting to you
huh Never mix business with
pleasure
FRANK
Thats right

Its a stand-off After a moment Rachel motions to
an outfit on a rack just behind him

RACHEL
Grab that would you
Frank takes a beat Looks out the window
FRANK
Im here to keep you alive not

to help you shop

Fuming Rachel sizes things up then grabs it herself
whipping the curtain shut behind her
A smile plays across Franks face

INT DARKENED ROOM - CLOSEUP - NIGHT

We see a mans hands remove a video cassette from its
sleeve The cover reads RACHEL MARRON - THE 1 HITS
The CASSETTE is gently eased into the slot of the video
player

Rachels image appears on the screen singing softly
intensely passionately into the camera WE TRACK INTO
the image as if a little hypnotized by it

ANGLE FRANK

Frank sits alone in his room lit by the glow of the TV
dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie Hes
watching Rachels videos Scattered around the video
player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CDs
tapes and videos Frank has been noting down lyrics on
the yellow legal pad on his lap Some of the phrases
are circled

As he watches we see a subtle change in his expression
It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first
time here watching her sing For a second she seems to
be singing to him alone passionate and vulnerable

He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian
Orthodox-type cross He fastens the clasp checking that
it holds then looks back to the screen

EXT MARRON ESTATE - NIGHT 51
Rachels SONG PLAYS OVER the moonlit estate

INT RACHELS BEDROOM - NIGHT 52

apart from Rachels collection of old and faded dolls

on the shelves and on the bed Rachel is getting dressed

for the evening A hairdresser stands behind her

fussing with her hair Rachel hears the MUSIC coming

from outside and moves to the window (The hairdresser

moves with her still busy with the brush) Gazing

across the garden she sees the light in Franks room

and hears her own voice singing out from there too

EXT MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT 53

separated just press it and Ill

Rachel doesnt know how to respond Shes stuck for
words Spector pokes his head out impatiently

club off the sidewalk and into the street

TONY
Fuckin a
Spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of
the limo Frank stares ahead in disbelief The NOISE
of the CROWD can be heard as they pull up front

EXT THE MAYAN - NIGHT 55

The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which
turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage
Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel
Many are grotesquely painted Some go into a wild frenzy
as Rachels limo pulls up There is a punch-up and a man
is beaten back Someone has a video camera Its quartz
light shines in through the limo windows Everybody
squints at the glare

EXT BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 56
As Rachels car pulls up the beaten man dances weirdly
at the curb with blood streaming from his nose

A pair of security guards try to hold them back As her
limo stops a chant begins
CROWD

Rachel Rachel We want Rachel

Others join in as the mob presses forward

The instant she exits the car her expression goes public
-- a wide show-biz smile Sandwiched between Spector and
Devaney with Tony in front and Frank at the rear Rachel
makes her entrance

A young man breaks the barrier moving toward Rachel
Frank grabs him by one of his belt loops gracefully
guides him all the way across and slips him under the
opposite cordon into the arms of a security guard

INT BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 62

is a combination of fear and humiliation When they have

The crowd roars its approval
Frank nervously scans the room Rachel smiles and moves
along the stage MUSIC starts in the bg Masking
obvious fear she starts to sing
As she takes one hand from the microphone her fingers
tremble She clasps it again to hide her anxiety

INT MAYAN - NIGHT

Rachel approaches the end of her song her voice coming
ever stronger Spector comes up to Frank in the wings
positioning himself combatively between Frank and his
view of Rachel

SPECTOR
Are we having a communications problem
here

FRANK
What

Spectors presence is a distraction Frank steps to one
side for a better view of Rachel Spector moves too
SPECTOR
Apparently I didnt make it clear
to you how things go around here
FRANK
You told me you were going to
tell her And you didnt
SPECTOR
I didnt think she could handle it
FRANK
But she handled it fine
Frank continues to peer past Spectors shoulder his
vigilance undiminished Soothed and nurtured by the
obvious admiration of her audience Rachels fear is
beginning to vanish The song is taking over Spector
changes tack becoming confidential man-to-man

SPECTOR
Look Frank I know what youre

Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a
wall of curtain ropes
FRANK
One word
SPECTOR
It could clinch her the nomination
FRANK
One word in print about any of
this
Spector nods half-gasping Frank tightens his grip
Franks attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the
crowd
SPECTOR
Trouble with you is you dont
understand the sympathy vote

INT STAGE - NIGHT
Rachel scans the crowd spread before her like a surreal
mural
Camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare
The thundering adoration is like a stimulant She darts
a look to Frank and gives him a fierce naughty girl
smile
RACHEL
(turning back to
crowd)
You like that Would like to
hear another Billy

From the wings Billy Thomas gives her the nod to go for
it It seems to be alright with everyone The band
starts playing a dance beat
RACHEL
(on the prowl)
I think my feet are trying to
tell me something wanna see a
new video
The crowd explodes They know what song is coming
They start to move with Rachel
RACHEL
(dancing talking)
I want to dance
She skitters to the other side of the stage baiting her

fans Her new video explodes across the video wall
behind her The crowd surges forward

Two security guards nervously tense up watching the
crowd When one fan tries to climb onstage Frank
reaches out and unbalances him so that the man falls
back into the audience Another man climbs the stage on
the other side One of the guards darts out like a
ballboy at a tennis match pushes the fan back and
scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance The
crowd is getting even more excited pressing closer
trying to touch Rachel

The security guards move in but Rachel gestures for
them to back off

ANGLE - FRANK

Franks task has suddenly become impossible A forest of
hands and faces start to engulf Rachel Anyone could be
the killer Franks eyes dart over them all his gaze
intense as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower
RACHELS POV

Looking offstage at Frank His frustration is almost
intoxicating to her She struts over the lip of the
stage A man leaps up from audience to join her Frank
starts forward Rachel gestures to him to hold back
waving him off

INT WINGS - NIGHT 65
Spector stands well out of Franks reach staring at Rachel
onstage He catches Franks attention yelling back
defiantly

SPECTOR
Look at her fucking great

INT ONSTAGE - NIGHT 66
Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and
grinding sinking to her knees The crowd roars

approval

Frank quickly sizes up the scene He speaks into a SURV
KIT microphone in his sleeve Across the room we see
Henry listening pushing an earpiece to his ear Henry
quickly scurries to an exit Frank starts moving toward
the stage At that moment the lucky man Rachels
dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her
gleefully like the dance partner she has been pretending
to be One of security guards rushes forward to extri-
cate her The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard
into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel

She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of
the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans

The audience goes wild This is the kind of thing
Rachel was famous for when she was starting out The
scene resembles a rugby scrum with Rachel the ball

Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans --
deeper into the audience Her dress is ripped and torn
apart The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears
into the crowd

CLOSE ON RACHEL

Fear fills her face Shes gone over the edge literally
and figuratively Shes lost control Tony and the
security guards are fighting to get to her slamming
bodies out of the way In the bg the video continues
on its serene uninterrupted way

FRANKS POV

He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings

BACK TO SCENE

Frank grabs it and heads to center stage He aims the
extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage
The chemical foam does its job scattering fans

Frank leaps onto the floor kicking a wild-eyed young
blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel
taking her in his arms Tony runs ahead of Frank knocks
a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow

FRANK
Tony not there
TONY
Ill take care of this
He heads for the door

TONY
Just follow me
He turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull

EXT THE MAYAN - NIGHT

Tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a
swath through the crowd Rain beats down
TONY

Make way here Outta the way
A burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes
back hard The crowd immediately sides with him yells
encouragement But Tony is the better man and sends him
sprawling The rest of the way to the curb opens up
At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and
turns in bewilderment to Rachel But she is not there
A couple of people laugh

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT 68
Rachel and Frank emerge from the darkness between two
garbage bins and get into the limo Henry has waiting there
The car moves out with a SCREECH of tires narrowly missing
Spector as he staggers out of the building
SPECTOR

Hey What the fuck Farmer

Farmer Come back here
The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the

street leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and
speechless

INT LIMO - NIGHT 69
Frank turns and looks at Rachel She is diminutive

doll-like alone in the center of the large limousine
seat Her hands rise to her face and her body begins to
shake with sobs as she sits there alone in the tattered
remains of her dress

Frank turns away to avoid staring at her but he feels

uncomfortable Henry senses what is going on and
speaks softly
HENRY
Never done that before
FRANK

Its been a long night

INT THE MAYAN - NIGHT 70
The crowd is thinning out A dim worklight is burning
somewhere backstage The auditorium is a mess the

cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the

riot FOOTSTEPS APPROACH walking pausing as if looking

for something

Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small fragment

of Rachels dress The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it A hand

picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME We hear the

sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath The feet
move on
INT MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT 71

Fletcher is asleep in his bed Frank waits as Rachel
glances in Then she moves away Opening the door to
her room she steps back allowing him to enter ahead

INT RACHELS ROOM - NIGHT 72
Frank moves quickly into the room checking the window

and French door Rachel waits silently by the door

All is clear He steps back to the door As he

approaches her she begins to tremble

He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms Slowly
holding her he leads her to bed moving aside some of
Rachels dolls laid out on the pillows

Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are
shaking so badly she cannot undo it Frank gently does
it for her She willingly allows him to undress her and
not a word is spoken between them As she sits naked
still trembling he pulls down the covers and guides her
gently into bed

As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of
his hand He looks down stroking her forehead like a
childs

RACHEL
Arent you going to ask me why I
behave like that

I know why
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen care-
fully cutting and eating a peach The door at the other
end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in soaking
wet He has just made his way home from the MAYAN and he
is boiling He sights on Frank and moves toward him fast
Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him As
Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt Frank spins
low out of his seat Tonys legs are knocked out from
under him He lands hard on his back and finds himself
looking up at Frank who holds him down with the chair he
was sitting on like a lion tamer a leg strut pressed
against Tonys throat Frank looks down at him question-
ingly as if to ask Had enough
Tony scowls and nods Frank lifts the chair away Tony
stands up and faces him Frank turns away and Tony

throws a punch at his head barely catching him as Frank
ducks and moves in under it He hits Tony twice and
throws him against a cabinet Tony gets up slowly looks
around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall
He holds it in front of him threateningly

Frank shakes his head Hes getting irritated He picks
up the knife hes been using on the peach and flips it in
his hand so hes holding it by the blade With the same
fluid motion weve seen earlier he throws it at Tony

It sticks in the wall an inch from Tonys ear Tony

does a slow take and then lowers his blade Frank picks
up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink He glances

at Tony

FRANK
I dont want to talk about this
again
74 EXT MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAWN 74

Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate
house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man-
sion

The grounds are quiet beautiful misty

We see him from behind some foliage as if hes being
covertly observed stalked A twig snaps and he turns
sharply Its Rachel Shes dressed in a soft jumpsuit
and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him

The suit softens her appearance she looks lovely Her
manner too has altered she is charming -- friendly and
very girlish
RACHEL
Hey Gotcha didnt I

FRANK

Frank shakes his head
RACHEL
Whats the matter Fraid Ill

suit
FRANK
No Im afraid Ill have to jog

They both smile
RACHEL
Great I guess I cant do it

Rachel stops pumping gasps for air and for one moment
rests a hand on Franks arm to support herself She
removes it quickly
RACHEL
Will you walk with me a little
Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds
RACHEL
(hard for her)
I know this is kinda late but

They walk in silence for few moments When Rachel
she sounds genuinely unsure of herself
Its very appealing And if its an act

finally speaks

DAY

The SOUND is DEAFENING A wet car comes out of the
tunnel of machinery In the distance glimpsed through
the spinning brushes Henry talks to a couple of workers
as he waits for the limo to be cleaned

Hands appear with a large chamois cloth moving easily
and fast over the hood and windshield A black in his
early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car
A second pair of hands appear White hands in rubber
gloves They open the drivers door and push a vacuum
suction hose inside The hands switch ON the car RADIO
loud Loud enough to hear over the din outside the car
The hose works its way over the front seats
DJ (VO)
And heres another biggie

from a lady very much in the news

these days Miss Rachel Marron
We see the owner of the hands It is the young blond
man Frank kicked aside at the MAYAN His name is DAN
His face is impassive

DJ (VO)
the hit song from the movie
Queen Of The Night I Have

Nothing
The song begins and Rachels voice fights the din In
the back of the car Dans hose probes around nosing
into all the crevices of the upholstery It sucks up a
crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap
beside the rear seat The hose is switched off and the
gloved hands retrieve the picture

INT LOCKER ROOM - WASH-A-RAMA - DAY

Tight shabby facilities Dan opens the combination
padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo
inside
As the hands remove the rubber gloves the inside of the
locker is revealed Pasted over every inch of the locker
are pictures of Rachel Marron One tabloid shot of her
dancing with the word whore scrawled across it Taped
to a single sheet of white paper in the center like a
holy relic is the torn scrap of Rachels dress from the

MAYAN The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to

it

84 INT FBI LABORATORY - DAY 84
Special Agent Court is seated next to a white-coated
technician The technician is leaning over one of the
neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier

message He sets it on a white sheet then brings the
blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on
the letter

scarf and tinted glasses The combination goes a long
way toward disguising her They pause at one of the dis-
play windows Inside is a poster for the movie Yojimbo
a large picture of Toshiro Mifune looking scruffy and
fierce

RACHEL

Well he didnt look like he
wanted to die to me
FRANK
Theres a big difference between
wanting to die and having no fear
of death
They walk down the sidewalk
RACHEL
And because he had no fear of
death he was invincible

FRANK

Well he sure creamed em all in

of conditioning and discipline

RACHEL
Oh my god Thats it isnt it

Rachel hums softly picking up the words to the song As
we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head
RACHEL
You like this
FRANK

A beat then Rachel bursts out laughing
FRANK
(reddening)

RACHEL
(trying to compose
herself)
Im sorry Its just that

Its so depressing
Now theyre both laughing

FRANK
(grinning)
It is isnt it
Suddenly a dish drops to the floor Frank still dancing
makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between
Rachel and the noise His head turns to locate the source
of the noise

RACHEL
Dont worry Ill protect you
They drift back into the music Rachel singing Frank
watching

Franks car is parked in the driveway A light goes on
in a basement window

INT FRANKS HOUSE - BASEMENT
Frank hangs back drink in hand as Rachel explores the

basement Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym
target rangeweapons workshop The place has a kind of
unfussy order about it a simplicity
RACHEL
(almost to herself)
Its very quiet here
She walks to some shelves -- a random selection of
books football and karate trophies framed citations
and other memorabilia She glances at a dusty framed
photo of a football team
RACHEL

God look at you
She looks at Frank quizzically
RACHEL
Whatd you play

FRANK

RACHEL
Were you tough
FRANK
No Fast

Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai
sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall She
looks at it peering closely

RACHEL
You some kind of a samurai too

Frank smiles

RACHEL
They said you were in the Secret
Service What made you get out

Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall

FRANK
Money

Rachel looks around at Franks modest home

RACHEL
I can see your tastes are
extravagant

She looks at Frank and then back at the sword She
reaches out to touch it

RACHEL
May I

Frank nods Rachel takes it off its mount carefully
unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off

FRANK
Watch yourself

Rachel slides the scabbard off The naked blade is
breathtaking Rachel holds the sword out before her
She walks toward Frank then stops and looks over the
blade at him
RACHEL

Youre a hard one to figure Frank

Farmer
He stares at her She steps closer so the blade is only
about a foot from his face

RACHEL
It seems to me a bodyguard must
know little peace
Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only
about an inch from his chest He reaches out over the
blade to Rachels neck and unties the silk scarf she is
wearing there One hand draws the scarf away The other
hand lingers for a moment on her neck then lifts away
FRANK
Watch this
He has raised the scarf over his head in the space
between them With two hands he spreads it out and then
lets it go Slowly billowing the scarf floats down
over the blade and is cut in two These two pieces float
slowly to the floor
Frank takes Rachels wrist and moves the sword away to
the side They are both holding it as Rachel presses her
body against Franks and they begin to kiss

holster

FRANK
You can live with that or you can
fire me

RACHEL
But I cant fuck you

Frank turns and looks at her This is hard for him too

RACHEL
I dont believe this

She stops suddenly and with a roar of combined frus-
tration humiliation and rage she lurches from the bed
in search of her clothes Frank shuts his eyes in morti-
fication and pain

EXT MARRON ESTATE - POOLSIDE - EARLY MORNING
A nanny sits in the early morning mist embroidering

Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool Hes
putting new batteries into Fletchers boat Fletcher
watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the
batteries much preoccupied
FLETCHER
(watching him)
Shes real mad at you isnt she
Frank stops what hes doing and just looks blankly at the
batteries in his hands Theres a beat of silence
FLETCHER
She told me she doesnt understand
why youre so shitty to her
Franks shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible
sigh He gently resumes fitting the batteries still
not looking at Fletcher In the quiet of early morning
its almost like a confessional
FRANK
Ive spent a lot of time learning
not to react to things like other
people do Its my job But it
doesnt always work Fletcher
it doesnt always work
FLETCHER
I dont think I understand
FRANK
(looks at him)
Im an old man compared to you
pal and I dont understand either
And Im starting to get the
feeling I never will
Theres a crunch of footsteps behind him He looks
around
With a big flourish a copy of Daily Variety is put down
in front of us front page upwards
NICKI (0S)
Ta Da

Frank takes in that its Nicki then glances at Variety
lying on the concrete beside him Splashed across the
top the headlines announce the days news of the
Academy Award nominations Rachels name is among the
Best Actress nominees The Hollywood Reporter follows
Frank picks up Variety and stares at it Nicki stands
beside him with the mornings mail under her arm

NICKI
(looking at him)
Thought youd like to know
Everyone said she was a sure thing

Of course you know all about that
She raises an eyebrow gives him a look Frank looks
steadily back at her She drops a small pile of mail

beside the magazines several letters and a small
packet Shes embarrassed by Franks gaze
NICKI
Im sorry That was out of line
Its none of my business Heres

todays question marks for you
She turns and walks briskly back to the house Frank
watches her go then looks slowly down to the pile
From across the pool Fletcher watches silently then
pushes his boat out into the deep water

INT SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - JANITORS ROOM - DAY 94
Frank is investigating the small packet with a surgeons
precision checking it with a stethoscope and a metal
detector sniffing at it
It has been addressed in the normal way except that
Rachels name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted
above the address He begins carefully slicing away the
wrapping Inside is a cardboard box The contents are
still hidden by packing paper He picks it away with
tweezers Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box
and movement in the paper Frank drops the box into a
bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags
The movement slows and stops Frank extracts the item --
it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted
sign hung around its neck

112 EXT POOL AREA - DAY 112
This place is crowded with hundreds of guests basking on
chaise lounges A sea of sun-baked faces virtually as
far as the eye can see The sight of the crowd and the

presence of the news crew seems to push Rachel to a
whole new adrenaline level
Rachel walks among them moving swiftly evaluating the
bodies displayed before her in words and expressions
playing to the camera
RACHEL

Oh my God Look what theyre

wearing Mother hide your eyes
Heads turn to look

RACHEL
I couldnt wear that suit Honey
youre naked Of course if I

had a body like that
There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests
She pauses to shake a hand and now all the guests
throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is
among them
People stand on chairs scramble for pens and paper

to get a closer look Lounges collapse drink GLASSES are
BROKEN flower tubs are trampled A lot of pushing and
shoving starts - too much for the video crew who abandon
the filming attempt
SPECTOR

Great babe They got what they

needed Lets get back inside
Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachels side gently
easing a path for her Schiller scurries behind in
Franks wake
Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard
appears in the throng She eyes him appreciatively

RACHEL

(to lifeguard)
You look like a man of good taste
to me Come to my party tonight
(to Schiller)

Ben make sure this boy gets to

my party
Schiller nods Rachel glances at Frank making sure he
gets the point and then shes off again The throng
gets tighter Franks having to work harder steering
her towards the door back into the hotel The familiar
chant starts up Rachel Rachel Its starting to
resemble the frenzy of the opening scene This time
amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces a few
bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved
forward A child starts crying lost in the mess of legs
and Bermuda shorts A distraught mother tries to reach
him Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd
surges again
Amid the chaos whistles and scattered applause Rachel
drinks it all in

RACHEL
(over her shoulder)
Thank you Thank you Come
tonight and give till it hurts
With a final surge Frank makes it to the door with his
party The door closes shut behind them A mass of
distorted faces pushes onto the glass The party walks
on briskly
RACHEL
(to Spector)
Im beginning to wonder about your
judgement Sy Why do I have to
keep paying my dues if Ive
already arrived

run

SPECTOR
(very fast)
Kick me beat me whatever makes
you feel good But lets not
pretend you dont like it Were
too close for that Whipping
people into a frenzy is why you
got into it in the first place
Rachels eyes lock with Spectors -- theres a real connec-
tion and understanding here that she spends a lot of time
denying Frank sees it as clearly as Spector whose tone
becomes almost soothing --
SPECTOR
And its nothing to be ashamed of
either not for a second Its a

gift and only a handful are
given it Many call but few are
answered

SPECTOR (CONTD)
Dont fool with the blessing
Rachel The magic is sustained
through its use

RACHEL
Now youre going to tell me about

is no longer in his grasp Instead incredibly Frank
seems to have passed through the mans body and flicked
him into the corner of the stairwell
The Cuban hits the wall hard Jarred but not lost he

comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a
baseball bat

Frank steps in and under the mans long arms and hits him
four times around the chest and jaw Each of Franks
hands lands twice their movement is barely visible

the Cubans ears simultaneously with cupped hands

Rachel waves this off

HERB
You must be very successful to

Rachel smiles and looks out of the window
RACHEL

HERB
Frank came back and stayed six
months after the Reagan thing
Rachels questioning look encourages Herb
HERB
Frank wasnt there the day he was
shot He never got over that
(a long pause)
We buried Katherine that day
Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat

EXT ON LAKE - SUNSET 151
Fletcher Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden
water in the skiff Fletcher sits at the back operating

the outboard controlling the movements of the boat He

wears a life vest Rachel watches him proudly Fletcher

locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it

for a laughing moment with a Look Mom no hands

gesture
Rachel looks to Frank and smiles the wind blowing her
hair
WIDE ON LAKE - DUSK

CAMERA is DOWN at water level by the lakes edge In the
distance the small boat skims across the surface A
light mist is coming up

EXT BOATHOUSE - DUSK 152
Henry helps Fletcher tie up the boat for the night It
is much foggier now and almost dark
FRANK

I dont want anyone going out in

it until youve checked it over

Henry nods

HENRY

FRANK

Every time
In the distance Rachel and Fletcher have just reached
the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him
round and round in a circle She hugs him close and
kisses his hair After a few moments Fletcher squirms
free and runs to catch up with Rachel

INT HALLWAY - LATER
Rachel munching on a raw carrot browses a row of family
photographs The sounds of dinner being prepared come
from the kitchen
We see the history of the family in the pictures Frank
as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb
Herb as Police Chief of Bend Oregon being given a civic
award Frank as a college football wide receiver Herb
and Katherine Farmer all dressed up and being introduced
to Jimmy Carter by Frank the picture-perfect family home
in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers
Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger
talking to some female reporters There standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with him are Frank and Portman
Portmans also smiling at the women flirting Frank is
in a familiar pose alert unsmiling vigilant Rachel
looks at the two of them for a second
Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice anda
drink for Rachel in his hand He watches her for a
moment as she studies the photo
She turns and sees him They lock eyes for several
seconds She smiles as he hands her the drink
FRANK
(inclining his head
toward the photo)

Portman sometimes had trouble

remembering what his job was

Suppers ready
We can see from Rachels face that she feels embarrassed
about her behavior in Miami

INT DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The meal has been enthusiastically consumed Fletchers
manhandling a chicken leg his face covered with crumbs
and drippings Rachel shakes her head laughing

HERB

cabinet and walks it over to the table A half-finished

game He leans over and blows on the pieces -- sending
a small cloud of dust into the air
HERB

Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from
the kitchen a bowl of popcorn in his hand Frank takes
a place across from his dad by the fire The others
gather round

Frank studies the board Rachel lowers her head into a
cupped hand fascinated
RACHEL

FRANK

beside Fletcher Fletcher peers intently at the board
as he chews on a handful

fishing rod as he comes out At that instant the sound
of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air Franks
head snaps toward the boathouse Henry in the distance

The move fitfully through the eerie beautiful scene
In and out of the fog Stop listen wait go Two
wary interchangeable animals Frank disappears into
the fog When the figure reappears Frank is moving
faster closing the gap

The figure seen in CLOSEUP for the first time is wear-
ing a dark-colored ski mask His breath billows out of
the mouth hole whitening in the cool March air He
hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the
direction of the FOOTSTEPS He does not fire SILENCE
Frank stops and rests on his haunches Listening he
hears the intruder move The sounds have stopped up
ahead Close

The figure peers into the fog gun up Hes ready
confident He waits Nothing

Frank from his crouch does something brand-new He
raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip ready
to fire He holds it easily And then he does something
really strange Frank closes his eyes After a beat we
hear MOVEMENT Frank eyes still closed swings his gun
15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS

The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered
six inches from his shoulder His eyes are wild behind
his ski mask Frightened he suddenly crashes away in
the opposite direction We FOLLOW There is ANOTHER
SHOT from Frank very close to the man

pretty far gone He shakes his head no He realizes
that that kind of fear had never occurred to him and
recognizing that fact sets him back into his thoughts

FLETCHER

of
Frank doesnt have the will to resist anymore He lets
his hand drop away from Fletcher

Frank silhouetted moves toward the stairway to the main
level There is light up there

186 INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT
Frank begins climbing the stairs When he has gone a
quarter of the way up Rachel appears at the top and
begins walking down

At first she doesnt see Frank when she does she
hesitates a moment then continues down They meet and
try to sidestep each other but twice they go in the
same direction unable to get around Rachel already
emotionally ravaged cracks She begins slapping Frank
hard about the face and torso One of the first blows

the wall He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt
to protect himself from the onslaught She cries as she

hits him
RACHEL
(hysterical)
You you you You brought this
pain into my house Now youre

here Where were you then Why
didnt you save her It was your
job to protect me and she died
doing it It was me they were
after And you let them kill her
(she gasps for air)
She never did anything to anyone
As she loses the strength and the will to hit him her
blows become sloppy weak She sinks to the steps
sitting on them sobbing
RACHEL
She never hurt anyone She was
good
(she looks at him
entreats him)
You saw her She never wished
anyone any harm Did she Did
she
Frank looks at her shakes his head no Rachel puts
her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments
her crying slows
RACHEL
(finally quietly)
She never hurt a soul
(long pause)
I didnt love her well enough
I didnt take care of her
(a beat)
She gave me only love

nocks the GLASS from his hand it SMASHES loudly against

for a long moment then softly continues on his way

EXT POOL AREA - MARRON ESTATE - DAY 186A
Its bright sunshine Fletcher is splashing noisily in

the pool with a few other kids His nanny waits

patiently at the side towels at the ready

At one side of the pool Rachel sits lost in thought
mourning her sister

At the other side sits Frank also thoughtful He too

is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears

some of the responsibility

The SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue

EXT MARRON ESTATE - GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 187
The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi-
nated in the distance The guard patrols at his station
nside the TV screens flicker and glow

Perched on the top of a slight hill Frank sits alone and
motionless under a big tree He gazes down at the gate-
house his face lit softly by the glow from its lamps
All around him the rest of the estate is quiet and
tranquil in the moonlight

After a moment another silhouetted figure slowly ap-
proaches and stands beside him Its Rachel

RACHEL
I guess youve heard whats
happening
Frank nods
RACHEL

Mind if I sit down
Frank shakes his head They sit side by side for awhile
both lost in thought Rachel seems very calm
RACHEL
t isnt over yet is it
Frank shakes his head
FRANK
He knows he still hasnt got you
RACHEL
So hell come again

FRANK
Its possible

RACHEL
The Oscars

FRANK

Maybe
Rachel takes this philosophically She tugs at the
grass thinking
RACHEL
When I was back in Squirrel Hill
I started betting my friends
fifty bucks each that someday Id
win an Oscar You can understand
how important it is that they see
me up there if I win
She looks at him and smiles
RACHEL
If everyone of those pikers comes
through it could add up to a lot

of money
FRANK

I think its very dangerous
RACHEL

I know But I cant stay up here
on my hill forever

They are silent for awhile Rachel lies back on the
grass stares at the sky
RACHEL

I didnt get to this place in my
life by doing the smart thing
every time
(as Frank nods)
How ‘bout you Frank Farmer Out
there on the edge did you ever
do something that didnt make too
much sense except maybe inside
you In your stomach somewhere
Something that wasnt smart
(looks at him)
Ill bet you have plenty Ill
bet you do Nobody gets really
good without it And youre good
I know that
She sits up beside him

RACHEL
I dont know why all this has
happened to me
(a beat)
but I do know that none of
its your fault I hope you can
hear me because this is how I say
Im sorry
Frank accepts

RACHEL
(relieved)
So Im going to go see if I win
an Oscar And I wont worry about
it at all Because Ive got you
to protect me
Frank almost smiles
FRANK
Thats right

fast enough for Rachel
She jumps the last six feet staggering slightly as the

planes jet wash hits her whipping her clothes and hair

Without pausing she runs to Frank who takes her in his
arms They embrace and kiss They kiss again and again
Finally slowly Rachel draws back her eyes are filled
with tears

to reveal the little enamel cross

INT CLERMONT HOTEL (IOWA CITY) - NIGHT

It is a Rotary Dinner

The CAMERA TRACKS ALONG the front of the head table which
runs from one side of the room to the other

ROTARY PRESIDENT (0S)
Our speaker this evening the
honorable congressman from the
fifth district Galen Windsor has
been a lone courageous voice

he alone has challenged those who
have linked organized crime with
legitimate business throughout our
state

STILL TRACKING we see the Rotary President as he nods to
a distinguished-looking gentleman one seat to his right
On the wall a sign identifying the hotel and a club
banner which reads -- THE ROTARY CLUB OF IOWA CITY

The CAMERA CONTINUES to TRACK and the Rotary President

goes OUT

OF FRAME

ROTARY PRESIDENT (0S)
But first our benediction will be
delivered by Reverend Phillip
Hardy of the First Presbyterian Church

STILL TRACKING we see the Reverend get up as the men
around him bow their heads

REVEREND HARDY
Heavenly Father please bless us
today as we meet in friendship and duty
STILL TRACKING as we REACH the end of the table
REVEREND HARDY (0S)
And Lord whatever dangerous
endeavors those among us may take
let them never be without your
sanctuary
The CAMERA STOPS Standing against the wall behind the
table is Frank As the Reverends prayer goes on all
heads are bowed to receive the benediction All heads
but Franks The CAMERA MOVES IN TIGHT ON his face
REVEREND HARDY
For all we know in our hearts
that even though we may walk
through the valley of the shadow
of death you are with us
guiding and protecting us Amen
The Reverends final words segue into Rachels song
Franks searching gaze around the room is arrested for
a moment as though reacting to Rachels voice

INT CONCERT - NIGHT 229
Rachel ends a phrase She dabs at the corner of her eye
as she continues the song that still binds them together

INT ROTARY CLUB DINNER - NIGHT 230
VERY CLOSE ON FRANK
His expression so intense in the opening scene of the
film is softer now Rachels voice continues as Frank
carefully scans the room
FADE OUT
