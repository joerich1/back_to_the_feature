EXT UPSTATE NEW YORK - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

FROM THE AIR we look down ona beautiful and tranquil
setting An old well maintained elegant estate surrounded
by woods From this view there is no movement Appears that
NO ONE is on the grounds

SUPER HYDE PARK UPSTATE NEW YORK
ESTATE OF PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT
AUGUST 13 1943

Cur shot BANKS and the whine of a small plane becomes
prevalent We realize that our view is someones POV from
inside a small plane

EXT HYDE PARK - DAY

Seated in a wheelchair by the back door of the estate isa
small man with glasses A blanket draped over his immobile
legs Hardly a figure that would be considered the most
powerful and important’ man on the face of the earth this late
summer day Hes watching the small plane circling to land

PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT begins to wheel the chair
inside A butler appears immediately from the house to help
As they go inside Roosevelt takes a quick glance back at the
small plane preparing to land

EXT LANDING STRIP DAY

The small plane touches down and taxis to a stop near a LARGE
BLACK SEDAN

As the door to the plane drops several military vehicles
emerge from seemingly out of nowhere Weve hardly noticed
but now there are dozens of armed military personnel around
the airfield

WINSTON CHURCHILL hauls his heavy frame down the steps of the
small plane Hes followed by three aides The ranking
military officer salutes Churchill returns it then climbs
into the back of the car with his aides The car drives away
military vehicles in front and behind
INT HYDE PARK - DAY

Roosevelt is seated on a sofa No sign of the wheelchair two
men sit opposite One is dressed in military uniform He is
ANDREW MORGAN secretary of Defense The other is well
dressedRoosevelts most trusted advisor HAROLD
CARMICHAEL They are in the middle of a conversation

ROOSEVELT
He requested the meeting two days
ago flew from London to New York
yesterday and he plans to leave
tomorrow morning A rather quick
trip even by Mr Churchills
standards

CARMICHAEL
Weve run all the diplomatic back
channels No one has any idea what
this is about

GENERAL MORGAN
Still no change in military
operations Everything is status
quo as far as were concerned

ROOSEVELT
Well despite Winstons rather
sensitive nature I doubt hes come
all this way in such a short time
to inquire about my health

CARMICHAEL
Mr President I think we should be
very cautious

An aide entering the room interrupts
AIDE
Mr President Mr Churchill has
arrived

Before the aide is finished Churchill strides into the roon
Allbusiness He looks at the two men opposite Roosevelt

CHURCHILL
General Morgan Mr Carmichael

They stand Nod greetings Churchill doesnt give them time
to make small talk

CHURCHILL
Mr President its such a lovely
day Perhaps we could go for a
stroll

Morgan and Carmichael are shocked Churchill KNOWS Roosevelt
cant walk Off their expressions

EXT HYDE PARK DAY

Churchill pushes Roosevelts wheel chair down a wooded path

CHURCHILL
Our intelligence has suspected for
months that Hitler would step up
research on a bomb powerful enough
to end the war

ROOSEVELT
As has ours

CHURCHILL
Last week we were able to confirm
that hes formalized plans for
accelerated research We havent
been able to nail down much in the
way of details but we do know he
intends to bring together a group
ef the top minds in Germany and
isolate them for a period of
months He fully expects them to
succeed before we do

ROOSEVELT
Hitler expects many things

CHURCHILL
Hes becoming desperate I believe
we must assume that he will do
whatever is necessary for their
research to be successful

They stroll a few seconds in silence

CHURCHILL
May I ask how your research efforts
aregoing

Roosevelt looks back over his shoulder A direct question to
a rather sensitive and complicated question

ROOSEVELT
Im told we are making good
progress
CHURCHILL
Anything more specific you coulda
share Our allies will be
quitenervousto hear of this
latest development with the
Germans

An even more direct question Roosevelt ponders These two
are the most powerful allies in the world at this moment and
yet even they are alittle guarded with each other Its
that time in history After a moment Roosevelt raises his
hand for Churchill to stop Churchill moves around in front
of the wheelchair They now face each other

ROOSEVELT
Were at least six months away
Probably a little more

CHURCHILL
Our Intelligence believes the
Germans could be as close as three
months if Hitler is able to marshal
the Germans best minds

ROOSEVELT
If he can marshal their best minds

CHURCHILL
Not everyone will be volunteering
Many in the academic community are
skepticalof the Nazis

ROOSEVELT
Hitler has never been one to suffer
skepticisn

CHURCHILL

No But perhaps some of his
volunteers will be less productive
than others

ROOSEVELT
Do we know how or when he will
bring these scientists together

CHURCHILL
Not yet We hope to have more
details within the week
Unfortunately I think we must
begin to move before we have all
the information
ROOSEVELT
Paratroopers

Churchill shakes his head no

CHURCHILL
Almost impossible for us to get
enough men behind enemy lines for
an attack on such short notice

Roosevelt digests this as he stares into the woods A tong
beat

ROOSEVELT
You know Mr Churchill these
woods are alive with animals Deer
raccoons rabbitseven mountain
lions and wolves We seldom see
them but they always see us They
always know when were in their
woods yet they leave us alone
Because they dont perceive us as a
-threat We seem passive

CHURCHILL
And you believe such a strategy
would be wise with thé Nazi wolves
in the German forest

Roosevelt offers a broad smile at his friends quick grasp

ROOSEVELT
We do have a group of seemingly
passive predators in place do we
not

CHURCHILL
It would probably mean the end of
their operationin success or
failure Not to mention
considerable personal risk to each
of those men

ROOSEVELT
They all knew the dangers when they
went into the woods My guess is
this is the mission each of then
hoped for when they volunteered

A long knowing stare between two men who in their own way
are as desperate as Hitler
EXT GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

Pitch black Theres no moon tonight You can barely make out
trees along a dirt road The landscape appears deserted

SUPER GERMANY AUGUST 16 1943

HEAR the low squelch of a walkie talkie By God there is
someone out here

POV through binocularslong shot of some sort of compound
The ‘place is dimly lit

NEWKIRK (05S)
(English accent)
All quiet on the Western front Any
sign of the target

Still the binocular POV Whatever this place’is the Germans
dont want it seen from the air Heavily armed German guards
patrol the perimeter of a fence barbed wired at the top

LEBEAU (0S)
(French accent filtered
through the walkie
talkie)
We can hear them but we cant see
them yet

ANGLE Col HOGAN and NEWKIRK Hogan is American Confident
attitude and a twinkle in his eye Newkirk is a British Air
Force Officer That dry English wit fully engaged

They are hidden behind a large rock near the side of the
road In black jump suits their faces painted with black
camouflage paint Hogan lowers the binoculars Hes been
listening as he watched the compound

HOGAN
Were go

Newkirk punches the talk button

NEWKIRK
Its a go

Find LeBEAU at another hiding spot about a mile down the road
from Hogan and Newkirk (away from the compound) Hes dressed
identical to the others LeBeau is small in stature but big
of heart Hes French intelligence He smiles signals with
his hand across the road

Directly across the road from LeBeau is CARTER Hes also in
black Hes American An engineer by training a munitions
expert by experience He nods acknowledgment As LeBeau rises
slightly out of his crouch and peers down the road

HOGAN (OS)
(filtered through
LeBeaus walkie talkie)
Let us know when the package is
delivered then get back to the
‘barracks Well wait here to
confirm the delivery safely inside

“LeBeau makes a larger motion with his hand signaling someone

up the road toward Hogan

ANGLE KINCHLOW (Kinch) Hes stationed up the road about 100
yards from LeBeau and Carter Same jump suit but no paint
Hes African-American Infantry man originally but soon
proved invaluable as a communications expert He cradles a
bomb in his hands He signals back Everyone set and ready’

As LeBeau moves back in place we can just make out a LARGE
GERMAN supply truck lumbering up the road toward LeBeau and
Carter No headlights

As the truck moves closer LeBeau and Carter both pull on a
thin wire that runs across the road between them The wire
tightens and three sharp thin metal spikes barely visible
pop up across the road The spikes are spaced about two feet
apart It would be pretty hard to miss these on the narrow
road Carter and LeBeau release the wire and the spikes fall
back into the dirt

The truck is within 20 yards Two armed German soldiers
standing in the back of the truck watching the road behind
them The truck moves closer to the spikes Sweat on the
brows of Carter and LeBeau

The front wheels of the truck now even with our men Just
after the front tires have passed over the spot where the
spikes are hidden Carter and LeBeau pull the wire tight The
spikes pop up into the path of the rear tires

INT GERMAN TRUCK - NIGHT

The German driver drops a cigarette ash into his lap He
squirms to knock the burning ash away from his crotch
jerking the steering wheel hard right in the process
EXT TRUCK - NIGHT

The truck lurches toward the edge of the roadvery near
LeBeau The left rear tire misses the spikes entirely The

right tire catches a spike but its the edge of the tire
near the metal rim

INT TRUCK - NIGHT

The driver spins the wheel to bring the truck back on the
road
’ A

EXT TRUCK - NIGHT

The spike lodges harmlessly between the tire and the rim The
force of the truck moving forward and pulling back left
breaks the spike off its wire base As the truck rolls
away

LEBEAU
(whispering across the
road to Carter)
Its so damn hard to find good
materials during wartime

A frustrated Carter nods agreement LeBeau picks up the
walkie talkie

ANGLE Hogan and Newkirk waiting anxiously LeBeaus voice
over the walkie talkie

LEBEAU
(filtered)
Problem at stage one Colonelthe
package was not delivered

HOGAN
(into walkie talkie)
Wave Kinch off Well take it from
here

Hogan pulls a bundle of explosives from his jump suit A LONG
fuse attached

ANGLE Kinch He sees that the truck is not slowing down No
flat tire Kinch thinks Hes feeling like a hero

ANGLE Hogan andNewkirk They quickly pull a large tree ©
branch’ across the road Too big for the truck to drive over

The truck moves closer to where Kinch was hiding Hes not
there FIND him lying flat on his back at the edge of the
road He cradles the bomb delicately on his chest Its dark
enough that he might get away with thisif he doesnt get
run over by the truck As the front wheels of the truck pass
within inches of his head Kinch rolls hard underneath the
truck He ends up on his back with the truck passing over
him He quickly reaches up and grabs the frame of the truck
with one hand With the other hand he gently wedges the
bomb onto the trucks cross beam Its taking all of his
strength to hold on as hes drug along the road

CLOSE ON Kinchs hand as his fingers reach for the timer on
the bomb Just as hes about to activate the timerthe
truck swerves again knocking him loose The timer NOT set

Kinch lies dead still in the middle of the road as the truck
Moves over him If the two guards in the back look down hes
a dead man But the guards have been thrown off balance by
the drivers latest maneuver Theyre not looking out the
back of the truck theyre looking forward hollering insults
(in German) at the driver By the time they turn back
laughing at their own clever insults the truck has moved far
enough away for Kinch to be safe

CLOSE ON Kinch still lying face up dead still

KINCH
(to himself)
First time Ive been thankful to be
a black man in Germany

ANGLE Hogan and Newkirk as they see the truck coming into
view

NEWKIRK
Want me to handle this Colonel

HOGAN
(smiles)
Ill take it Cover me from the
front If they move my way fire
toward the munitions compound to
divert their attention

Newkirk moves up the road just beyond the tree branch

The truck stops in front of the branch The guards
immediately jump to the ground guns at the ready

DRIVER
‘(hollering in German)
Come move this tree you lazy

bastards

The guards move to the front of the truck and start pulling
the branch to the side of the road

As they work Hogan steps from the side of the road and walks
calmly to the back of the truck Like a Sunday stroll in the
park He carefully places the explosives on the frame under
the truck and lights the fuse (the truck is so loud the
Germans will never hear a burning fuse)

Hogan takes a peek down the side of the truck The Germans
are still working to move the tree limb

-Hogan looks inside of the back of the truck Mostly food
supplies but one box catches his attention Its marked with
the image of a parachutist Hogan quickly climbs on the back
bumper of the truck and rips open the box Inside are NOT
parachutes but stacks of PANTY HOSE (paratroopers used these
to cuff their pants so they wouldnt snag trees and to help
keep warm during winter jumps) He grabs several pair and
hurries into the brush just ahead of the returning Germans

The guards hop aboard and the truck continues on its way to
the munitions camp As the truck pulls out of sight Newkirk
joins Col Hogan

NEWKIRK
a touch sarcastic)
That went well

HOGAN
Oh yeah Were starting to act
like prisoners of war

Hogan begins removing his jump suit Underneath he is wearing
a GERMAN OFFICERS UNIFORM Newkirk is surprised Hogan
hands Newkirk the jump suit and the panty hose

HOGAN
Take these to the barracks with
you Ill be back before Schultz
surprise 11 oclock bed check

NEWKIRK
Where are you going

HOGAN
Ive been invited into town by a
beautiful fraulein

Just then the compound (framed behind them) erupts in an
enormous explosion The place is going to go up in flames

HOGAN
And Im feeling lucky

INT GERMAN HOFBRAU - NIGHT

The place is packed with high-ranking German officers A few

Gestapo agents at tables around the room Lots of beerlots
of singinglots of fun OLGA an attractive woman in her
late 20s is onstage singing a German bar standard

FIND Col Hogan in the far corner of the bar Hes alone
observing Maybe his date stood him up

Olgas song ends and she takes a bow to hearty applause She
moves offstage and directly to Hogans table She sits
without being invited Hogans smile tells us shes his date

OLGA
(in German)
Buy me a drink soldier

HOGAN’
(in German hollers to a
passing waiter)
A beer for the lady

Olga leans in close They shift to English Although their
conversation is light their eyes are constantly watching the
room especially the Gestapo agents

HOGAN
You must have wanted to see me
awfully bad to bring me in here
with so many officers and Gestapo
around

OLGA
You are aware that General
Burkhalters daughter is getting
married this weekend

HOGAN

Ive been meaning to talk to Klink
about that I cant believe I
wasnt invited

The waiter places the beer in front of Olga Hogan quickly
pays him Olga waits until the waiter is away

OLGA
It would be better for you if there
was no wedding

Hogan reactsnot sure where shes going with this

OLGA
Miss Burkhalters groom is trouble

HOGAN
How so

OLGA
His name is Herbert Kleimper Word
is he made a deal with Burkhalter
to marry his daughter in exchange
for being transferred off the
Russian front and to Stalag 13 as
Commandant Klinks aide-de-camp
You do not want this man at Stalag
13 Colonel Hell carve Klink up
like a Christmas goose

She has Hogans attention

HOGAN
Can you find out anything about
him Background military
record anything we might be able
to use

OLGA
Hans is trying He thinks Kleimper
may have grown up not far from
here

HOGAN
Sabotaging a wedding might be a
nice change of pace Seems like all
weve done lately is blow up
munitions dumps

She leans in close flirting Sexy smile

OLGA
Ahh but you are so very good at
explosions Colonel

Hogan pulls Olgas head to him kissing her on the lips Olga
immediately slips onto his lap

OLGA
If you wanted me on your lap
Colonel all you had to do was ask-

Hogan gently moves Olgas head as if using it as a shield We
now realize that this isnt about getting her in his lap
Hogans gaze has locked onto something across the roon

HOGAN
Major Hochstetter just came in
13

ANGLE Gestapo MAJOR HOCHSTETTER A wiry man of 6-4 One lock
tells you this is a man that has no conscious Hes flanked

by two black suited Gestapo agents The noise dims a little

as Hochstetter walks down the center of the room toward the

bar His two henchmen move down either side

Hogan keeps Olga in his lap using her head to stay out of
Hochstetters line of sight He keeps his eyes on the room
even as he kisses and talks

OLGA
The Gestapos been watching this
place for months Theyre convinced
were harboring the resistance

HOGAN
You are

OLGA
They dont know for sure

Hochstetter and his men now have the bar surrounded The
bartender is doing his best to remain calm but hes sweating
bullets Suddenly Hochstetters arm shoots across the bar
grabbing the bartender by the collar Hochstetter pulls the
man across the bar twisting his collar tight as he does The
bar falls silent

HOGAN
(whispering)
They seem pretty certain

Olga sneaks a glance Unmistakable fear in her eyes

HOCHSTETTER

(loudly so everyone in

the room can hear)
Please everyone go back to what
you were doing We only came by to
have a little conversation with
Herr Schmidt about his resistance
activities

Hochstetter yanks Schmidt across the bar and onto the floor
at his feet The’Gestapo agents from either end of the bar
move quickly to stand over him All eyes still trained on
Hochstetter A panicked Schmidt tries to stand

SCHMIDT
(pleading)
Please Major I am only

The two agents BOTH viciously kick him their shiny black

boots digging deep into his ribs on either side He cries out
in agony as ribs break

HOCHSTETTER
You will address an officer of the
Gestapo only when you are told to
You resistance ‘swine are always so
ill mannered

One of the agents pulls a WOODEN BILLY-CLUB like weapon and
STRIKES Schmidt wickedly on the back of the head He
collapses unconscious As they grab Schmidt by-his arms
Hochstetter turns back to the room

HOCHSTETTER
Start the music

The small band hurriedly begins playinga little out of
sync Hochstetter looks around the roomspots Olga Stares
at her for a long moment Hogan stays behind her the best he
can without beingtoo obvious Does Hochstetter recognize
him After a beat Hochstetter SMILES at Olga

HOCHSTETTER
(with subtext)
Please fraulein entertain then
Without Herr Schmidt here Im
afraid the burden falls to you

Does he mean the burden of entertaining or the burden of the
resistance She stands careful to stay between Hogan and
Hochstetter as long as she can Hogan turns away from
Hochstetter to watch her walk to the stage

Once Olga is moving toward the stage Hochstetter leads his
men (dragging Schmidt) out the door The moment they are
gone the callused military crowd begins talking again
almost as if nothing happened

After a beat Hogan stands and starts toward the exit He
glances over his shoulder at Olgadoesnt see a VERY DRUNK
GENERAL OTTOMEYER enter and cross in front of him Hogan
collides with Ottomeyer causing the drink the general
carries to spill down the front of his uniform The general
is pissed

HOGAN
Sorry

OTTOMEYER
You clumsy ass Why dont you watch
where you are going

14
Hogan does net want to get into an argument with a General
but this guy isnt going to let it go

HOGAN
Im very sorry General

OTTOMEYER
What is your name you clumsy ass
Who is your superior officer

Hogan takes a breath He™s trying to keep this low-key but
knows it could escalate very fast Just as he is about to
launch into his explanation

OLGA
(sexily over the
microphone from the
stage)
There you are General Ottomeyer
Where have you been hiding tonight

The crowd cheers for Ottomeyer Olga teasingly wags her
finger for the general to come her way

OLGA
Ive been looking all over for you

The Generals mood shiftshe no longer has any interest in
Hogan As the general moves toward Olga Hogan slips out

EXT HYDE PARK NEW YORK ESTATE - EVENING

President Roosevelt sits on the verandah where we first saw
him Hes in his wheelchair the blanket over his legs
Alone watching the sun beginning to set A PHONE RINGS from
inside the house Roosevelt continues to stare at the sky
deep in thought

An aide steps out the back door
AIDE
Mr PresidentMr Curchill is on
the line

Roosevelt looks at his watch Its late in London He starts
to turn his chair toward the door The aide moves to assist

INT HYDE PARK ESTATE - EVENING
Roosevelt wheels to a phone at a desk

ROOSEVELT
Winston

we
wi
Roosevelt listens

ROOSEVELT
Is there any way to confirm it

INT CHURCHILLS OFFICE - NIGHT

Churchill stands at his desk looking out at the London
skyline Phone to his ear

CHURCHILL
Intelligence is still pretty fuzzy
on some of the details but we know
that at least some of the
scientists already have started to
move It looks like they are taking
them somewhere in the north Were
using every means possible to watch
the train stations in that area

INT ROOSEVELTS LIBRARY —- EVENING
The beautiful sunset framed in the window

ROOSEVELT
At least theyre coming to us If
the Germans are moving that
quickly we have little choice but
to take the chance Let our men
know the delivery is coming All
other instructions should arrive
with the package

Roosevelt listenssmiles wryly but then a little annoyance
in his voice

ROOSEVELT
No You were completely right to go
forward

INT CHURCHILLS OFFICE - NIGHT

Churchill smiles at Roosevelts annoyance
CHURCHILL
Thank you for understanding Time
is of the essence The plane left
within the hour We are trying to
contact Colonel Hogan now

Churchill listens

CHURCHILL

And to you Mr President
A concerned Churchill hangs up
EXT GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE NIGHT

Hogan moves through the woods He comes to a TREE STUMP
bends and easily lifts the stump Its a fake covering an
entrance to a tunnel Hogan crawls into the tunnel the tree
stump pulled back into place as he disappears

EXT STALAG 13 - GERMAN PRISONER OF WAR CAMP - NIGHT
Establishing
INT BARRACKS - STALAG 13 - NIGHT

Onlya-small light on in this sparsely furnished prisoner of
war barrack Bunk beds along two walls a small table in the
middle of the room

The men are in their skivvies ready for bed A couple of
- them pacing Tension in the room Carter peeks through the
boards on the window

NEWKIRK
The Colonel said hed be back
before 11
(to Kinch)
How late can we call London

KINCH
They said to make contact as soon
as Colonel Hogan returned No
matter what time

LEBEAU
Cant blame him for being late
really Have you seen that little
fraulein he visits in town

NEWKIRK
RS Is sex the only bloody thing you
French ever think about

LEBEAU
(a little defensive)
Dont take your petty British
repression out on me Newkirk Just
because we French know how to have
a little fun and you Brits

NEWKIRK
answer the question LeBeau Do
you ever think about anything but
sex

LeBeau contemplates a beat
ae
LEBEAU
You make it sound like a bad thing
We have been in this place for more
than a year

NEWKIRK
So thats your answer You only
think about sex

LEBEAU
And food and wine

NEWKIRK
Sex food and wine

LEBEAU
(little smile)
The three basic necessities of
life

CARTER
(peeking out the window)
Schultz is headed this way

KINCH
Where should we say Colonel Hogan
is tonight

CARTER
Hey lets fuck with Schultz and
tell him the truth

KINCH
That the Colonel had a date in
town

CARTER
Why not Hes not going to believe
anything we tell hin

The bottom bunk against one wall flies up the mattress
lifting like a door A COLLAPSABLE LADDER FOLDS DOWN Hogan
still dressed in the German officers uniform climbs the
ladder into the room The bed folds down behind hin

Before the men can say anything the door of the barracks
burst open and SGT SCHULTZ heaves himself into the room
Schultz is a HUGE BARREL of a man Tall and broad Hes not
the brightest light on the tree Though he tries to play the
tough German prison guard he really wants nothing more than
for the war to be over and to go home to his wife and wife
kids

SCHULTZ
(heavy accent)
Surprise bed check

The men scramble to stand at attention in front of Hogan
‘Theyre doing their best to hide that hes in German uniform

Schuitz double takes Stares at the assembled men Theyre
blocking his view of Hoganexcept for his clearly visible
German hat Schultz stares at the hat Everyone in the room
knows that he sees the hat

HOGAN
(to Schultz)
Dont ask

Schultz thinks a beat then

SCHULTZ
I know nothing

He wheels and exits the barracks Hogan begins peeling off
the uniform As he undresses

NEWKIRK
Londons been trying to reach us
Sounds important They wanted to
wait for you

HOGAN
Get them on the line

The men start down the tunnel As Hogan slips into his
regular clothes we HEAR the SQUAWK of a RADIO coming to life

EXT STALAG 13 - NIGHT

CLOSE ON the flay pole for Stalag 13 The German flag is
flying From the top of the pole emerges a radio antennae As
the antennae goes up the radio reception gets clearer

INT RADIO ROOM (IN THE ‘TUNNEL) - NIGHT

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

An open field Another dark night Find Hogan and his men
crawling face down in the field They are dressed in black
camouflage again Hogan stops looks at his watch

INSERT It reads 155

HOGAN
(to Newkirk)
What time do you have

Newkirk checks his watch

NEWKIRK
Five after two

Hogan shakes his wrist

HOGAN
Ive got to get a new watch This
thing gets slower and slower

CARTER
I can probably pick you one up from
one of the guards Ive been
kicking their ass in poker lately

LEBEAU
Youve been playing poker with the
guards and havent let us in on it

CARTER
Heh they dont have that much good
stuff to take

The others shake their heads in irritation at Carter
HOGAN
Anyone hear anything above the din
of your arguing

Nothing at first then the very FAINT drone of a plane

KINCH
Sounds like theyre right on
course

NEWKIRK

You cant tell that just by
listening
KINCH
Wanna bet
NEWKIRK
Yea Ill bet you 20 quid you
cant

HOGAN

Boys Lets not miss him arguing

They all roll over on their backs and begin scanning the sky
above

CARTER
Not much chance of missing him The
guys they send us can land ona
dime

HOGAN
(to Kinch)
Timing
Kinch is looking at his watch
KINCH
He should be visible in 10-9-8-7-6-
§-4-3-2-1
All eyes scan the skynothing

HOGAN
Good work Kinch

Carter and Newkirk chuckle at the little rebuff Kinch gets
to his knees points off in the distance

KINCH
There he is

The others look off toward the west Drifting down but a
good quarter mile off course is the dark figure of a
parachutist Hes drifting toward the dim lights of a farn

CARTER
Whete the hell is he going

HOGAN
These guys can land on a dime huh

Our heroes stagger to their feet and begin running across the
field bent over at the waist
EXT FARM - NIGHT

Hogan and-his men approach the farm cautiously Though there
is one light on no one appears to be home

Hogan circles around toward the livestock pehs in back
There we find our man Hes covered head to toe in mud from
landing in a pig sty And hes having a hell of a time
getting out of there because of the mud clinging to his
parachute Two LARGE PIGS are starting to push him with their
snouts Hes about 10 seconds away from full-scale panic

Hogan climbs up on the fence and reaches part of the
parachute without stepping off into the mud The others join
in and pull EARHART MENDELSON to safety

EXT FARM - NIGHT (LATER)

Earhart has been cleaned up and given a jump suitthat
hangs‘off him Hes TINY No more than 5-5maybe 110
pounds He has unruly curly hair and a heavy German accent

EARHART
My God that was horrible

HOGAN
Those pigs werent going to hurt
you They were just curious

EARHART
I meant the jump

HOGAN
Youve never parachuted before
What the hell are they sending you
in here for

EARHART
The most important mission of the
war

The men exchange amused glances This little pip-squeak has
arrived for the most important mission of the war Off their
looks ”

s

INT WOODS - NIGHT

The men including Earhart move stealthily through the
darkened woods Everyone anxious for Earharts explanation

EARHART
Our intelligence believes the Nazis
are bringing together some of their
top scientists to build a bomb
capable of ending the war Hitler
has been so paranoid that until now
hes kept the best minds in Germany
pretty much isolated from each
other Now hes afraid that the
allies aré getting close to an
atomic bomb If they are successful
before he is then the war is over
If intelligence is right the
scientists are being brought to a
location in this area within the
next few days

HOGAN
That still doesnt explain what
London is doing dropping you in
here

EARHART
Im an atomic scientist Colonel
Hogan A German atomic scientist

- who left before the war And I am

told that I bear an uncanny
resemblance to my cousin Kiaus
whose nuclear fission research has
undoubtedly caught the attention of
Hitler

A beat Then Hogan begins to laugh Earhart puzzled by his
reaction

HOGAN
They dont really expect us to
switch you for your cousin right
under the Gestapos nose

EARHART
After you find out where they are
taking Klaus and when

Hogans smile fades Earhart tries to be upbeat

EARHART
The’ good news is that Klaus and I
really do look a lot alike

All of the men shake their heads in disbelief Earhart a
little nervous about their reaction Hes just now realizing
that the parachute jump in was the easy part of the trip

EARHART
(nervously)

London will contact us as soon as
they have an idea of where Klaus
will be arriving

off the mens looks of amazement

EXT STALAG 13 - DAY

Early morning

SUPER August 17 1943

-Through the gates rolls a large black German staff car The

car pulls up in front of Colonel Klinks office
INT BARRACKS - DAY

Newkirk is at the window watching Hogan and the others
including Earhart are around a table with maps of some kind
spread out in front of them Hogan points to a spot on the
map

HOGAN
This is the only station in the
area that makes sense for them to
come to

Newkirk POV GENERAL BUREKHALTER heaves himself out of the
back of the car and moves toward the entrance Hes fat and
baldas far from the master race prototype as you can get

NEWKIRK
Burkhalter

HOGAN
Right on schedule

Hogan stands and moves toward his bunk
HOGAN
While we wait on word from London
we still have a wedding to
sabotage

He ‘pulls something from under his mattress (we cant see
what) and marches out the barracks door

EXT STALAG 13 - DAY

Hogan strides across the yard toward Klinks office
Burkhalter already is inside

INT KLINKS OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Hogan winks at HELGA Klinks buxom and beautiful blonde
secretary Without a word he reaches for Klinks door Helga
stops him with a stern voice

HELGA
Colonel Hogan

He stops in his tracks Smiles as he turns and moves back to
her Hogan plants a kiss on the beautiful frauleins lips
Its not the first kiss for these two Helga smiles

HELGA
You are beginning to take me for
granted

HOGAN

Helga how can you say that I
think of nothing but you

HELGA
I amnot a fan of that woman in
town who calls herself a singer

Hogans smile fades just a little Hes been busted From his
pocket he pulls a pair of the nylons he stole from the
German supply truck Lays them on the desk in front of Helga

HOGAN
I was able to get my hands on one
pairfor you When it comes to
matters of the heart I am very
loyal

HELGA
The only part of your anatomy you
are loyal to Colonel Hogan resides
well below your heart

HOGAN
Fortunately thats your favorite
part of me

Helga giggles Indeed it is her favorite part Hogan starts
toward the door again

HELGA
You cant go in there Hes with
General Burkhalter

HOGAN
Thats who I came to see
27
And Hogan bursts through the door without knocking
INT KLINKS OFFICE - DAY

An obviously nervous COLONEL KLINK sits at his desk Klink is
S0ish balding A nervous incompetent man Hes trying to
ride out the war as Commandant of Stalag 13a place where
his prisoners actually seem to be on his side sometimes
Hell do anything to stay away from combat Hogan and his men
occasionally have to step in and help make sure that Klink
stays as Commandant They’ want no part of a real German
officer running the camp

Burkhalter is standing across the room Klink grows even more
nervous with Hogans arrival

KLINK
(voice rising)
Colonel Hogan this is not a good
time

HOGAN
Im sure it isnt No time is a
good time for your superior officer
to find out that you are violating
the Geneva Convention regarding the
rights of me and my men

Klink stands up From nervous to desperate

KLINK
(to Burkhalter)
I can assure you General that
there is no truth to this
slanderous accusation

HOGAN

(interrupting Klinks

sniveling)
Forcing us to assist with the
preparations for the generals
daughters wedding is outrageous
Just because LeBeau is a master
chef and Newkirk a renowned
tailor The Geneva Convention
specifically prohibits using the
labor of prisoners of war
for your personal benefit

KLINK
(almost pleading)
I did not ask your men to lift

BURKHALTER
(smiling)
Colonel Klink that is an excellent
idea
KLINK

‘ (finishing his sentence)
--anything that would be too heavy
for one man to carry

BURKHALTER
The first good idea you have had in
guite some time You should have
told me sooner so that we can get
maximum use of these mens talents

KLINK
Herr General I was going to
HOGAN
I think he was planning it as a
surprise
KLINK

And now youve ruined the surprise
Colonel Hogan

BURKHALTER
Have these men brought to my estate
this afternoon Under heavy guard
We dont want anyone getting any
ideas about escaping

KLINK
(overly prideful)
No one has ever escaped from Stalag
13 General

BURKHALTER
One of the great mysteries of the
world Klink

Burkhalter moves past Hogan toward the door
HOGAN
(to Burkhalter)
Im looking forward to meeting your
lovely daughter

BURKHALTER
Dont kiss up to me Colonel Hogan
My aughter is not lovely and you
know it
at
ed

(to Klink)
Herbert will report to you tomorrow
afternoon You are to give him
every courtesy ‘

KLINK
Ya vul

Burkhalter exits with a sneer leaving Klink and Hogan alone
The moment Burkhalter is gone Klink collapses into his
chair Depressed and distressed Head face down on the desk

HOGAN
Whos Herbert

KLINK
My worst nightmare

Off Hogans reaction
EXT BURKHALTER- ESTATE - DAY

HERBERT KLEIMPER strides across the grounds toward the front
of the house Hes tall blond handsome A perfect Aryan
specimen And a man you immediately dislike He climbs the
steps with purpose and enters the house

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - DAY

Kleimper enters Looks around Lots of activity in the house
As he looks Hogan and Newkirk enter the foyer from the back
of the house They are carrying several boxes each Kleimper
moves toward them

KLEIMPER
(curt) —
Which of you is Colonel Hogan

Hogan sets his boxes down on a table

HOGAN

Im Colonel Robert Hogan United
States Air Force

- KLEIMPER
You and your men are confined to
the first floor of this house
Except for the negro He will work
in the stables If any of you are
caught outside of your assigned
area you will be shot

HOGAN
And you are

KLEIMPER
Lieutenant Herbert Kleimper

HOGAN
Ahh the lucky groom

KLEIMPER
You will address me only when
ordered to

HOGAN
We were given our orders by Colonel
Klink the commanding officer of
Stalag 13 Are you countermanding
the orders of a superior officer

KLEIMPER
For the moment Colonel Klink is a
higher ranking officer But he is
in no way superior And yes I am
countermanding his order Make sure
your men are aware of their
restrictions There will be no
exceptions

Kleimper exits the house without a look back
Off Hogans look of contempt
INT BURKHALTER KITCHEN DAY

LeBeau is covered in flour Several fat German women bustle
around trying to understand what he is saying to them Hes
frustrated A delivery truck is at the kitchens exterior
door A middle-aged unloading supplies from the truck into
the kitchen

Hogan and Newkirk enter LeBeau looks up

LEBEAU
Colonel Hogan this is impossible
The stuff they have in this kitchen
is not fit to eat

Hogan takes a quick look around Hes not really that
interested in LeBeaus problems as a chef He makes eye
contact with the delivery man a signal between them The man
is HANS MITLER Hogan moves to him

HOGAN
Need some help

HANS
Danke

As they move toward the back of the truck

HANS
-Olga needs to see you Tonight at
the usual spot She says its
important

As they take boxes and move back into the kitchen Hogan nods
affirmative

The door from house suddenly BURSTS open and in steps a VERY
LARGE VERY MEAN woman ELSA BURKHALTER (perhaps the same
actor will play both the general and his daughter) She has a
mustache Stalin would kill for Shes wearing a riding
outfit She looks around the kitchen disgustedly

ELSA
Clean this mess up immediately
The German women immediately begin scurrying to clean the
kitchen Theyve obviously felt this womans wrath before

LEBEAU
General Burkhalter ordered a
special dinner prepared for guests
tonight

Elsa moves VERY CLOSE to LeBeau Her size and demeanor both
intimidating

ELSA
I give the orders in this house
And I want this kitchen spotless
before I return from my ride

LEBEAU
But Miss Burkhalter

Elsa leans in closerright in LeBeaus face

ELSA
Dont argue with me you
insubordinate little rodent Do
what I tell you or I will scrunch
you under my boot like a French
cockroach
co She exits in a huff LeBeau looks to Hogan stunned They
both look out the window where Elsa has met up with Herbert
He puts his arm around her as they walk
LEBEAU
I guess beauty is in the eye of the
beholder
HOGAN
Yeah but we all agree about ugly
He means them both Over his look
NEWKIRK (0S)
Colonel its too dangerous to go
tonight You heard Kleimper He
means business
INT HOGANS BARRACK - NIGHT
Everyone there including E Earhart Hogan is changing into
farmers clothes
HOGAN
She wouldnt ask if it wasnt
o important Maybe that drunk General
P
spilled more than his drink last
night
CARTER

Colonel is it possible you are
putting too much trust in this
woman You said yourself the
Gestapo has turned up the heat on
the local resistance For all we
know theyve turned her

KINCH
Or she was one of them from the
beginning

HOGAN

Shes never done anything to cause
us “suspicion

CARTER
She drug you into a bar filled with
Gestapo last night

HOGAN
eo To tip us off about Herbert
Kleimper From what Newkirk and I
saw today it was a good tip

- 32
CARTER
Colonel we all understand if this
is personal for you In France you
would be a god for juggling two
women from inside a prison camp

KINCH
Damned impressive for a white guy

Hogans not smiling

HOGAN
Being held in such high esteem is
deeply flattering But if Olga says
she needs to see me its because
she has something important And
thats the only reason

Hogan disappears down the tunnel
EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Where we saw Hogan enter the tunnel last night All quiet A
dog sniffs through the woods The dog stops at the tree stump
and raises his leg to relieve himself Just then a CRUDE
PERISCOPE rises from the stump and begins surveying the area
The dog jumps and barks furiously at the periscope always
staying just out of the periscope’s view

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT

Hogan looking through the periscopeconfused He can HEAR
the barking but

HOGAN POV Through the periscope He makes a 360 degree turn
but still cant see anything

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

The dog is still jumping and barking but hes jumping over
and behind the periscope as it moves Always just out of
sight

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT

Hogan stops turning the periscope Pushes his eye close to
the eyepiece Hes straining to make something out Takes his
hat off so he can get an even better look through the
periscope

Hogan POV Coming right into the lens is the dog finally
relieving himself in the perfect spotthe periscope
Hogan jumps back a little startled Then chuckles to himself
as he climbs out the tunnel

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Hogan scrambles out of the tunnel gently pats the dog Looks
around No sign of anyone else Hogan knows this dog

HOGAN
Heh Gunnert Good boy You alone

Hogan carefully checks the woods again Nothing

HOGAN
You gave me a good scare

Hogan stands and starts to walk through the woods The dog
follows Hogan stops

HOGAN
Sorry buddy this is a solo
mission Maybe next time

Hogan picks up a stick waves it in front of the dog then
throws it into the woods The dog bounds off after it The
dog eagerly picks up the stick and turns to return it
Degs POV Hogan is gone Hes disappeared without a trace
The dog looks confused then drops the stick disappointed
EXT ABANDONED FARM - NIGHT

An old farmhouse and barnboth in danger of falling down
Deserted from all appearances

INT BARN - NIGHT

Olga sits on an old barrel in the corner She looks at her
watch nervously Hogan is late

A NOISE from INSIDE the barn Olga quickly ducks down behind
the barrel On guard Tense She peeks outcant see
anything Starts to relax just a little Suddenly a hand
reaches into frame from behind her and covers her mouth She
struggles but someone has a firm grip The arm pulls her
down into a small pile of old hay

ANGLE to reveal Hogan He whispers in her ear

HOGAN
Youre getting careless
He takes his hand away from Olgas mouth and releases her
arms She hits him hard

OLGA
I knew it was you

Olga pushes him away but shesnot really mad

OLGA
I dont know what I ever saw in
you

HOGAN

“Good times warm nights and hard
to-get smuggled in goodies

Hogan takes a pair of the stolen nylons from his pocket and
hands them to Olga Shes pleased

OLGA
Other than that

HOGAN
Its wartime you have to take what
you can get This was the only pair 3
I could get my hands on

Olga takes the nylons pleased

OLGA
Thank you I may have something to
repay your generosity The Gestapo
hasnt suddenly shown up around
here just to pay their respects to
General Burkhalters daughter

HOGAN
(smile)
I knew they didnt respect him that
much
OLGA

General Ottomeyer agrees with you

- ‘ HOGAN
The drunken General from the bar
last night He looked about one
arink away from telling a beautiful
woman his life story

OLGA
Hes says hes a very important
man Important enough to know about
a group of special guests the
Gestapo is bringing to the wedding
But not important enough to know
exactly who they are or why they
will be staying at Burkhalters
past the wedding

She has Hogans attention He turns all business

HOGAN
When

OLGA
The first group will arrive at
Hammelburg on the-morning train
Another group on the afternoon
train

HOGAN
That doesnt give us much time

OLGA
For what Does this mean something

Hogan purposely doesnt tell all he knows Maybe Carters
suspicions about Olga are weighing on ‘him a little

HOGAN
Im not sure Maybe I need to get
back
Hogan stands to leave
HOGAN

Any word on what the Gestapo did
with Schmidt last night

OLGA
Nothing yet Every contact we have
is trying to find out but the
Gestapo is putting enormous
pressure on us A number of our
people have been arrested or
frightened underground

HOGAN
How muchdoes he know

OLGA
Enough to cause us all problems

HOGAN
Let me know if you get any
information

OLGA
And youll let me knowwhen
youre ready to let me know

She smiles Hogan smiles back Unspoken words about trust
passing between them

OLGA
Are all Americans as horrible as
you
HOGAN
I like to think Im in a class by
myself

Off Olgas smile
EXT STALAG 13 - NIGHT

The antennae on the flag pole goes up Accompanied by a LOUD
burst of static from the radio

INT RADIO ROOM - NIGHT

The men are huddled around the table Kinch has the
microphone

KINCH
Its no use Colonel Were not

a lot of jamming going on

Hogan picks up a photograph from the table in front of hin
Looks at it

HOGAN
(to Earhart)
How old is this

EARHART
Twomaybe three years My aunt

(hopeful but
frightened)
We do look a lot alike

Hogan takes a closer look at the picture

INSERT The man in the picture does look a lot like Earhart
except his hair is straight and he has a thin mustache

- 38

Hogan hands the picture to Newkirk

HOGAN
Lets see what you can do with him
Youve got until sunrise

Off the mens expressions
INT INTERRAGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Small dank roomdimly lit Two bare bulbs hanging from the
ceiling

Strapped to a chair is Herr Schmidt the bartender who was
drug away last night He is unconscious his head sagging
forward on his chest He has been beaten badly dried blood
from his mouth and nose

A leather-gloved hand SMACKS his jaw almost tipping the chair
ever No reaction from Schmidthe feels nothing now i

ANGLE to find Major Hochstetter watching as one of his
henchmen delivers the blow

HOCHSTETTER
Thats enough

The henchman steps aside as Hochstetter bends to take a
closer look at Schmidt He feels the neck for a pulse
Schmidt is dead

HOCHSTETTER
Dispose of the body Then let it be
known that Herr Schmidt is still
alive and being questioned Perhaps
we can find out more from him dead
than we did alive

The henchmen begins dragging Schmidts lifeless body from the
chair”

EXT STALAG 13 - DAY
SUPER August 18 1943

Early morning The big German staff car rolls through the
gates Burkhalter must be making another visit

INT STALAG 13 - DAY
A tired looking Hogan watches out the window Hes not

surprised to see that its Herbert who steps out of the back
of the staff caralone Herbert marches into Klinks
office Hogan stares deep in thought
EXT STALAG 13 - DAY

Hogan moves through a group of prisoners in the yard Sees
Schultz leaning against the back of the mess hall sneaking a
cigarette Thats who he was looking for

HOGAN
Does your wife know youre smoking
again Schultz

A startled Schultz throws the cigarette to the ground He
didnt see Hogan coming

SCHULTZ
Colonel Hogan you scared me

Schultz picks the cigarette up and takes a BIG hit to calm
his nerves

SCHULTZ
That monster Herbert Kleimper is
driving me to smoke
(whispers
conspiratorially)
He is trouble you know

HOGAN
Thats what I wanted to talk to you
about There may be a way we can
help you get rid of this guy

Schuitz takes a big hitinterested

SCHULTZ
Kill him

HOGAN
For now I just mean get rid of hin

Schultz wants to be a part but hes struggling with saying

yes to Hogan
SCHULTZ

Colonel Hogan I have a

responsibility as an officer of

Stalag 13 My loyalty is to the

German army

HOGAN
Schultz were the good guys
SCHULTZ
Yes but sometimes I have to be on
our side

Hogan casually takes a chocolate bar from his jacket and
hands it to Schultz Schultz takes it and begins unwrapping
and eating as Hogan moves in for the close

HOGAN
Do you really think the German arny
is loyal to you Schultz The
minute Kleimper gets Burkhalters
daughter pregnant hell have
complete control of this camp and
you and Kiink will be on the first
train to the Russian front

SCHULTZ
(incredulous)
He actually plans to sleep with
her
HOGAN

Herbert makes Burkhalter a
grandfather and he gets promoted to
commandant of Stalag 13

SCHULTZ
How do you know that
HOGAN
Have I ever given you wrong

information

Schultz gives him the raised eyebrow look As a matter of
fact Hogan has given him the wrong information before

HOGAN

OK A couple of times But not
this time We dont want that guy
running Stalag 13 anymore than you
do

i” SCHULTZ
Colonel Hogan in the past whats
been good for you has not been good
for the German arny

HOGAN
Were on the same team on this one
Schultzand we need your help

Schultz thinks This is a tough situation for him Schultz
takes a bite of the chocolate bar His face glowing with
pleasure from the fresh chocolate

HOGAN
All you have to do is cover for me
this morning

When Schultz doesnt object Hogan leans in to give Schultz
his instructions

INT GERMAN TRAIN STATION —- DAY

Crowded A train pulling into the station MOVE THROUGH the
crowd and find Hogan and Earhart against a wall where they
can see the passengers exit the train Hogan is wearing a
GESTAPO UNIFORM Earharts hair has been straightened and a
thin mustache added He does look remarkably like the picture
of his cousin They watch intently as people begin to climb
off the train Soldiers women and children a few Gestapo
officers dressed in suits

EARHART
How do we know that Klaus will be
on this train

HOGAN
We dont But there are only two
trains arriving today If our
information is right hell be on
one of them

Hogans eyes never leave the train as he talks

EARHART
What if ghey re all traveling
together

HOGAN

Im counting on German paranoia

EARHART
But what if they are

’ HOGAN
Theh were fucked

Hegan motions toward the train

HOGAN
Thats gotta be one

A Gestapo agent exits the train with a nerdy looking man in
his wake The nerd is carefully carrying a small wooden box
Hogan sees another Gestapo agent leave the
rail-thin man This scientist also carries a wooden box
Identical to the first one

with a handle on top He’s handling it like its gold

HOGAN
Its not Klaus but at least we
know they are bringing them in
What do you think is in that box

EARHART
Probably deuterium oxideheavy
water The Nazis have been using it
to act as a decelerate in creating
atomic reactions

Hogan doesnt know what the hell Earharts talking about
thats not the immediate concern

HOGAN
(urgent)
Will they all be carrying it

EARHART
I have no idea Colonel Hogan

HOGAN
If Klaus steps off that train
carrying a box like that we cant
make the switch Youre the expert
What do you think

Earhart is growing more ruffled by the second

EARHART
I think Im not cut out for
espionage

HOGAN

Too late When they pushed you out
of the back of that airplane you
bought a no-turning back ticket
Theres another one

HOGAN
Goddamnit Hes got one too
Whats heavy water look like

EARHART
Like regular water You cant tell
the difference with the naked eye

but

train with a tall

HOGAN
Then if hes not on this train we
can make a box

Hogan looks around the station checking out his contacts
They are all dressed in DIFFERENT SPORT COATS
EARHART
(panicked)
But then theyll expect me to have
deuterium oxide inside When ny
water doesnt react properly
theyll know Im an impostor

Hogans still checking his agents

HOGAN
Lets cross one bridge at a tine

Not the response Earhart wanted to hear

EARHART
There he is

Earhart motion toward the back of the train Sure enough
stepping down from the last car is Klaus a burly Gestapo
agent leading the way And hes NOT carrying a box

HOGAN
No box but wrong wardrobe and no
mustache

Klaus is wearing a sport coat that is DRAMATICALLY different
than the one Earhart has on And the mustache has been
shaved Hogan quickly spins Earhart toward the wall Hogan
keeps his eye on Klaus and the Gestapo agent as he yanks
Earharts mustache off (its a damn good fake one)

EARHART
(too loudly)
Ow That hurt

A few people around take notice Hogan stares them down
Remember hes ‘in a Gestapo uniforn

HOGAN
(in German)
Mind your own business

The people scramble away not wanting any part of a pissed
eff Gestapo agent

ANGLE one of Hogans resistance men Hes wearing a COAT very

similar to Klaus Hes quickly pulling it off

Klaus and the agent pick up bags and move off the platform
coming our way

Suddenly a man brushes past Hogan Its Hans the delivery
man He discretely hands Hogan the sport coat that our man
was pulling off Hogan takes the coat and starts rushing
Earhart out of his coat and into the matching one

HOGAN
Once youre inside no contact
EARHART
How will I know when its time to
get out
HOGAN

Well come for you

EARHART
And if you dont show up

HOGAN
Dont let them make that bomb

Klaus and his escort move toward the middle of the lobby

HOGAN
Show time

Hogan steers him out into the crowd They now trail Klaus and
the agent They move quickly to get right on their heels

Hans has swung around the lobby and is now walking
perpendicular to Klaus Hes on a collision course with the
agent Just as the man bumps the agent Hogan taps Klaus on
the ‘shoulder (Hogan is over Klaus right shoulder Earhart to
his left) Klaus turns around just as the agent begins
berating our man Hogan flashes a Gestapo ID and motions
Klaus to come a step closer Earhart steps into the space
vacated by Klaus The man who bumped into the agent moves
quickly away and the agent takes a few steps to follow
Earhart now right with him Just like switching matching
briefcases By the time Klaus turns back the agent has
disappeared into the crowd with Earhart

HOGAN
(in German)
You are to come with me

Klaus takes a quick look around His original Gestapo agent
is gonelost in the crowd Something about this doesnt
45

seem right but this is the Gestapo And Hogan has a definite
air of authority Hogan leads him away toward an exit

EXT FOREST - DAY

‘Hogan (still in Gestapo uniform) leads Klaus through the
forest

KLAUS
(in German)
I was told that we would be taken
by car to a private residence

Hogan pulls his pistol and points it at the German

HOGAN
And you believe everything the
Gestapo tells you

off Klaus’ look
EXT STALAG 13 - DAY

Herbert Kleimper strides across the grounds towards Hogans
barracks Hes pissed He marches to the barrack and enters
unannounced

INT TUNNEL - DAY

A small room next to the radio room lit by a gas lantern A
round table in the center of the room A portable chalkboard
on one wall A cot on another Next to the cot is a manacle
chained to the wall On one side of the room is the door to
the radio room Klaus head pops out of the crawl tunnel He
wriggles out into the room Hogan follows his gun still
trained on Klaus They stand

KLAUS
Who are you

HOGAN
Colonel Robert Hogan United States
Air Force And you are now
officially a prisoner of war

Hogan motions Klaus toward the far wall and attaches the
manacle to Klaus ankle Klaus is no dummy

KLAUS
So youve managed to kidnap a
German scientist By now theyve
surely discovered Im missing
HOGAN
Not if cousin Earhart is doing his
job properly

KLAUS
Earhart Hes alive

ROGAN
And well You didnt know

KLAUS
I havent heard from him since
Hitler came to power If your plan
is for Earhart to impersonate ne
Colonel Hogan then you are doomed
to failure

Hogan meets his gaze Very interested now

KLAUS

(arrogant)
Earhart may be well meaning in his
misguided beliefs But hes no
scientist He could not work as a
lab assistant for me
Hogan studies him carefully Not certain whether to believe
him or not Finally

HOGAN
Maybe we can find a use for a’
scientist of your stature Theres
a little project Ive been needing
done

KLAUS
I will die first

HOGAN
That will be your decision

Off Klaus uncertain expression

INT HOGANS BARRACK - DAY

Kleimper paces angrily Checks his watch then exits

Just as the door is closing behind him the bed covering the
entrance to the tunnel starts up Hogan SEEING THE DOOR
CLOSING quickly lowers the bed and waits a beat An instant
earlier and Hogan would have been discovered

Hogan emerges quickly from the tunnel and begins changing

into his camp clothes
EXT STALAG 13 - DAY

Kleimper is coming back across the yard toward Hogans
barrackthis time with two armed guards He talks to the
guards as they walk

HERBERT
One of you will be posted outside
the door at all times The other
will begin searching the camp
immediately I want him found

As if on cue Hogan steps from between two buildings right
into their path Hogan is carrying a couple of rolled up
magazines in one hand

HERBERT
Colonel Hogan I have warned you
that I would not tolerate your
antics You were confined to
barracks due to illness At Stalag
13 confined to quarters means that
you are not to leave

HOGAN
Ive been telling Klink for months
hes gotta move that latrine
closer

HERBERT
You expect me to believe that you
have been in the latrine for more
than 30 minutes

Hogan holds up the magazines

HOGAN
We just got a new shipment of
magazines in from the Red Cross
LIFE says you guys are having some
big problems in Africa

” HERBERT
Our problems in Africa are not the
issue Colonel Your insubor-
dination is

HOGAN
Klink 0Kd my confinement to
quarters

HERBERT
A decision that I will discuss
directly with Colonel Klink
(to the guards)
Escort him to his barrack and see
that he remains there

Herbert wheels away Off Hogans look of hatred for this man

INT BARRACKS - NIGHT

Everyone except Kinch seated around the table They are in
the middle of a conversation

CARTER
Kleimper has guards everywhere
Colonel We cant get off the first
floor to look around even for a few
minutes

HOGAN
Wehave to find a way If Kleinper
keeps us from getting in the middle
of this wedding we cant get rid
of him And if we dont get rid of
him well never be able to get
Earhart out of there

LEBEAU
Assuming they havent already
figured out that hes an impostor

NEWKIRK
Maybe there is a way to get us
upstairs
They all look to him
NEWKIRK

Whos the one person in that house
who even Kleimper takes orders
from

The light goes on for Hogan

HOGAN
Elsa

NEWKIRK
Her wedding dress was delivered
this afternoon My guess is shes
going to need the help of an expert
tailor to make herself presentable
All we have to do is let her know
where one is

off the chuckles around the table

Newkirk is in front of a sewing dummy A beautiful very
small white dress clings to the dummy Carter is walking
around the dummy as Newkirk stares trying to figure this
out

CARTER
Impossible

Newkirk keeps walking around the dummy

NEWKIRK
A challenge Definitely a
challenge But not impossible

INT BURKHALTERS HOUSE - DAY

A large basement room has been converted to a laboratory No
windows On one wall we see the stairs leading up It has the
feel of dungeon Gathered around a work table are the eight
Germanscientists including Earhart plus Hochstetter and
another Gestapo agent The scientists listen intently

HOCHSTETTER

For the next three months you will
not leave these premises Day and
night you have only one objective
»to successfully complete the

INT BURKHALITERS HOUSE - DAY

Newkirk and Carter move through the upstairs halls two armed
guards following closely They look in several open doorways
as they walk The first couple of rooms evidently dont have
what they are looking for because they dont even bother to
go in Just a quick glance in and then keep walking

CARTER
This is never going to work
NEWKIRK
It will work
CARTER
Newkirk not even you can pull this
off
NEWKIRK

(wry smile)
Want to bet

CARTER
Its going to look ridiculous

NEWKIRK
Carter Im not going to just throw
it together It will be delicately
incerporated into the original
They look in another door Newkirk stops Smiles

NEWKIRK
Perfect

Carter stares in disbelief

Newkirk POV Tall windows on the far side of the room And
they are covered with beautiful long WHITE DRAPES

INT TUNNEL - DAY
Klaus is alone Hes taken the cot turned it on its side

and is using the leg to chip away the wall around the bolt
holding the manacle in place Hes making some progress
EXT BURKHALTERS STABLES - DAY

Kinch is shoveling manure into a gunny sack when he HEARS the
sounds of a horse running (and breathing very LOUDLY) He
looks upto find Elsa riding toward the barn astride a HUGE
horse Size doesnt helpthdé horse is COVERED in SWEAT
Youve NEVER seen a horse this tired and sweaty ‘His tongue
is hanging outhes foaming at the mouth More sweat than
Albert Brooks in Broadcast News

She pulls the horse to a ‘stop in the barn door

ELSA
Get over here and help me down

Kinch moves over and reaches up to help her down

ELSA
Not like that you idiot Get down
on your hands and knees

KINCH
I beg your pardon

ELSA
Get down on your hands and knees
Here by the horse

Kinch hesitates Elsa slaps the riding crop against her boot
She looks pretty damned ridiculous

ELSA
Now

Kinch looks around Doesnt appear to be any way out of this
Kinch reluctantly gets down on all fours beside the horse
Elsa throws her right leg over the back of the saddle Shes
balanced on her stomach on the saddle Her feet are still
several inches above Kinchs back Shes bending her ankle to
reach for him but cant quite make it

ELSA
Up a little
7 KINCH
What
ELSA

Arch your back up a little

Kinch looks over his shoulder at her He arches his back The
toes of Elsas boot are about to find his back Hes looking
at herno doubt that if she drops down on his back its

52

going to hurt like hell Her boots are almost there

Just as her weight is about to land on his back Kinch
discretely moves one hand and PINCHES the horses leg The
horse BOLTS Elsa hanging precariously The horse charges out
the open barn door Elsa SCREAMING for help

Kinch slowly rises smiles as he watches the run-away horse
carry Elsa away

KINCH
Tell me to get down on my hands and
knees you fat Nazi bitch

Kinch goes back to shoveling manure into the sack
INT BURKHALTERS HOUSE BASEMENT LABORATORY - DAY

The eight scientists still around the table Hochstetter is
just finishing his speech to then

HOCHSTETTER
Each of you has been assigned a
room in the main house Your tine
hereall of your timewill be
spent either here working on your
research Or in your room Working -
on your research

He looks around the room

HOCHSTETTER
Any questions Good

He didnt give them time to ask any Hochstetter and the
other Gestapo agent leave The door closing behind them A
beat after they are gone then MICHAEL BISCHOF the
scientist across from Earhart speaks

BISHOFF
Well gentlemen it appears the only
way any of us is leaving this place
is to create the bomb they want

SCIENTIST 2
(whispers)
Not so loudly

BISCHOF
I think whoever is listening
already knows that were not
leaving unless our research
succeeds
Co

KLAUS EARHART
(a little too anxious)
Have any of you made progress

Bischoff stares at Earhart Maybe a little suspicious

BISCHOFF
Why dont you tell us what progress
youve made Klaus

Did he emphasize Klaus just a little too much EarhartKlaus
is afraid that he did

EARHART KLAUS
Ive been able to create small
scale reactions in the lab But Im
afraid my reactions are too small
and the steps necessary to get the
reactions too cumbersome to be of
much use militarily

BISCHOFF

Ive had some success with lab
reactions Perhaps we should start
by sharing our results

EARHART KLAUS
Of course

A beat The two men measuring each other

BISCHOFF
Why dont we allow the others to
get started here You can join me
in my room

Bischof rises Earhart doesnt have much choice As they
exit

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Newkirk and Carter are busy taking down the white drapes A
guard stands by the window lighting a cigarette Hes not
paying much attention The door to the room is open to the
hallway As Carter tries to fold one of the drapes Earhart
and Bischoff pass in the hall Carter has to think fast

CARTER
(to guard)
I have to go to the bathroom

The guard isnt pleased Its a fresh cigarette Carter
senses his hesitation

uw

CARTER
I know where its at Ill be right
back

GUARD

(firm)
If you are not back in three
minutes I will find you and shoot
you

CARTER
Ill be back

Newkirk and Carter exchange a glance as Carter exits
INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carter quickly moves down the hall in the direction Earhart
and Bischoff went Just as he rounds a corner he sees them
entering a reom talking As they disappear Bischoff puts
his hand on Earharts shoulder From Carters POV it appears
to be a very friendly gesture

A puzzled Carter checks his watch He doesnt have time to
take this any further He heads back to the sewing room

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - BISHOFFS ROOM - DAY

Earhart is seated in a straight chair Bishoff paces the
room They are in the middle of a conversation

EARHART
Impossible Its too costly and
time consuming to manufacture
enough heavy water to create the
size of reaction necessary

BISHOFF
Havent you asked yourself why we
are hereat this estate in the
middie of nowherenear a prisoner
of war camp

EARHART
I assumed it was to avoid allied
bombing
BISHOFF

Thats what the Gestapo wants us to
believe The reality is that were
here because the heavy water is
here

55
Earharts expression says he doesnt get it

BISHOFF

Theres a hydroelectric plant 20
kilometers east Last month it was
converted from producing electrical
power to the full-time production
of deuterium oxide Hitler has
given us three months to complete
- our research because in three
months that plant will have
produced enough heavy water to
accommodate a reaction large’ enough
te build a bomb bigger than anyone
has ever imagined

Off Earharts reaction to that information
INT HOFBRAU - NIGHT

The bar we saw earlier Its crowded tonight but not quite
as packed as the earlier scene A singer not Olga is on
stage We FIND Olga at a corner table nuzzling with General
Ottomeyer They look pretty cozy

A male waiter arrives at their table As he serves drinks he
discretely nods to Olga A signal After he moves away Olga
whispers in the generals ear

OLGA
Ill be right back I need to
freshen up in the little girls
room °

OTTOMEYER
(pretty drunk)
Not too long
OLGA
How could I stay away from you for
long
She moves away with a sexy smile
INT HOFBRAU KITCHEN - NIGHT
Olga pass through the kitchen on her way out the back A
couple of rats scurry unimpeded across the kitchen floor as
food is prepared
EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

She slips out into the dark alley and looks around Nothing
Its pretty spooky back here Shes cautious Maybe a little
frightened Similar to the scene in the barn

OLGA
(voice low)
Are you out here

No response

OLGA
I only have a few minutes

Still no response She looks behind several boxes Nothing
She walks a few steps down the alley Hogan inches out of the
shadows and pulls her back against the wall Shes very
frightened until she realizes its Hogan

OLGA
Goddamn youyou scared me

HOGAN
‘I needed to make sure you werent
followed The place is crawling
with Gestapo Even the Germans are
nervous Anymore news from the
general

OLGA
Nothing yet but hes drinking
again tonight Maybe I can get
something out of him later
(coy smile)
That may require a bit of
unfaithfulness though

HOGAN
War is hell

OLGA
Never more true than when speaking
of a night with General Ottomeyer

HOGAN
What about Schmidt

OLGA
Ottomeyer thinks the Gestapo is

holding him here in town Theyre
convinced he can provide them

important information about the
Resistance
HOGAN
He can

OLGA
But he wont
‘

HOGAN

Someone once told me that in times
like these anything is possible

OLGA
Not that Schmidt will not break
Any word from London

HOGAN
We havent been able to get
through The Germans have stepped
up their jamming

OLGA
When are you going to tell me
whats going on

HOGAN
(deliberately evasive)
As-soon as I figure it out

Olga hesitates It bothers her that Hogan isnt completely
trusting her As she starts to go

OLGA
Dont worry about Schmidt Well
find him and get him

HOGAN
Its too dangerous right now

Olga smiles Pleased at his concern But before she can
respond

OTTOMEYER (0S)
va (drunken slur)
Olga Are you out here my little
treat

Hogan hugs the wall in the shadows as Olga quickly steps out
and moves toward the back door of the bar Ottomeyer is
looking around for her

OLGA
(German)

Im right here darling Just
needed to get a bit of fresh air

As she steers Ottomeyer back inside Olga-glances to the
shadows hiding Hogan She offers him a reassuring snile
before disappearing inside

PUSH in CLOSE on Hogan in the shadows Obviously CONCERNED
INT FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

-Hans sleeps next to his wife in a small bedroom A HAND darts
into frame and covers his mouth Hans is immediately awake
Alert Hogan bends next to his ear

HOGAN
(whispering)
We have to talk

Quietly so as not to wake his wife Hans slips out of bed
He slips on his pants and follows Hogan out

EXT FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
Hogan and Hans stand in the shadows of the barn

HOGAN
I have to get back to camp before
one of Kleimpers hew guards does a
bed check but I need you to talk
to Olga tonight I dont want her
playing hero and trying to get
Schmidt out on her own Its too

dangerous
HANS
She will not listen to me
HOGAN
Tell her the order came from ne
HANS
(wry smile)

Colonel Hogan Olga only listens to
you when she agrees with you

HOGAN
Then follow her Do whatever you
have to do Just dont let the
Gestapo get their hands on her

Hans nods Takes a bicycle leaning against the side of the ©
barn and pedals away Hogan watches a beat then moves away in
“59
the opposite direction
INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - EARHARTKLAUS ROOM - NIGHT

Its a small cramped room One dim light -burning in the
corner The bed is madeit hasnt been slept in Find
Earhart sitting at a small desk carefully studying a map He
makes several notations then takes a small sheet of Paper
and begins writing

INT TUNNEL ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON the chalkboard Its filled with complicated
formulas and diagrams Frustrated chalk scratches through
part of the formula and reworks it This stuff makes the
Goodwill Hunting” formulas look like elementary algebra

HOGAN (0S)
All that deep thinking make you
hungry

ANGLE WIDE to find Klaus doing research work He was so
engrossed that he didnt hear Hogan enter from the tunnel (or
so it seems) The cot has been pushed down slightly so that
it covers the area of the wall that Klaus was digging at

Hogan hands him a plate of food Hogan begins to quickly
change out of the farmers clothes he wore into town

KLAUS
This is outrageous

HOGAN
The food or your assignment

Klaus lifts the cover on the plate and looks at the food

KLAUS
Both

HOGAN
Ours is worse I got this froma
local farmer
(motioning to the chalk
board)
Making any progress

KLAUS
Its laughable You capture one of
the most brilliant minds in the
world and this is what you force me
“to do
HOGAN
Its a lot more important to the
success of me and my men than you
might think Make a list of the
things you need Well get them for
you

Hogan moves up the ladder to the barrack

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - LIBRARY NIGHT

General Burkhalter and Herbert sit in front of a fire sipping
cognac

HEBERT
I dont think you should have
allowed Hogans men onto the second
floor to work on the dress

BURKHALTER
I didnt allow them Elsa did
Perhaps you would like to tell her
its a bad idea

Burkhalter smiles Herbert isnt going to tell Elsa anything
right now and they both know it

HERBERT
Youre not worried they might see
our scientific friends wandering
around and grow suspicious

BURKHALTER
Of what They would have no idea
who the scientists are And even if
they suspected something who would
they tell

HERBERT
There should be a guard with them
at all times

a - BURKHALTER
There has been

HERBERT
Good
(devious smile)
If you are confident that our
security here is impenetrable
maybe we should allow them a little
more access And have Klink assign

a guard from Stalag 13 to accompany
them while they are here

Burkhalter gives a hard look He suspects Herberts motives
for this suggestion but hes not certain who is being set

up Herbert recognizes his uncertainty

HERBERT
It would be an interesting test of
Klink and his men

BURKHALTER
We have never had a problem’ at
Stalag 13

HERBERT

(intended subtext)
An oddity for which there must be
an explanation

Burkhalter ponders the idea

HERBERT
If a spotlight were shone on
Klinks incompetence it would make
naming me Commandant that much
easier I suspicion sending Klink
to the Russian front would give you
a certain degree of pleasure

Burkhalters still not quite convinced
HERBERT
And I must confess I already
despise Colonel Hogan
Wicked Burkhalter smile of agreement

BURKHALTER
Il talk to Klink in the morning

Exactly the answer Herbert wanted
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Find Olga in bed beside General Ottomeyer The General is
snoring loudly but Olga is wide awake Initially we might
think that the Generals snoring is keeping her awake But
after a beat she slips out of bed and into her clothes draped
across a nearby chair She takes a last look to make sure
Ottomeyer is sleeping soundly then slips out the door

As soon as the door closes behind her Ottomeyers snoring

stops He sits up in bed and stares at the door Hes wide
awakeand not the slightest bit drunk

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - NIGHT

Earhart creeps down a darkened hallway Hes near the end of
the hall when he HEARS footsteps coming from around the
corner He looks aroundpanicked He sees a half opened
door a few feet away Theres no other choice He ducks into
the door just as several armed guards round the corner

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT

Earhart slides into the room closing the door quietly behind
him He gaspsfrightened Swallows the gasp so he wont he
heard but for just a second whatever he sees in that room
has put the scare of his life into him Slowly the fear goes
out of his eyes

Earharts POV The sewing dummy that Newkirk was using Only
now it has been expanded to three times its original size by
taping pillows to it The almost completed WEDDING DRESS
hangs on it It too has been greatly expanded by sewing

-pieces from the white drapes into the sides Back lit by the

moon it looks like a hellish monster about to pounce

Earhart breathes a sigh of relief As the footsteps pass he
Slips back out of the room and moves DOWN the stairs

EXT ALLEY NIGHT

Olga moves stealthily down the alley She knows exactly where
she is going HOLD A beat after she passes Hans creeps down
the alley FOLLOWING her

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Earhart slips into the darkened kitchen He looks around He

spots LeBeaus oversized apron hanging on the back of a door
Takes the paper he was writing on upstairs and quickly slips
it into one of the pockets on the front of the apron

Just as he turns away from the apron the door to the kitchen
swings open Standing in the doorway is Herbert Both men are
surprisedther Herbert smiles

HERBERT
Aw Herr Kloiber Cant sleep

Earhart calms his nerves Hes surprisingly effective Having
your life depend on it can make you a good liar

EARHART
Just rummaging for a little
midnight snack

Herbert goes to the cupboard Takes some food out

HERBERT
Me too Would you like to join me
I would love to hear your thoughts
on our research

Earhart doesnt have much choice They move to the table and
sit down together

EXT ANOTHER ALLEY NIGHT

Olga looks across down the alley to where twoarmed soldiers
stand guard in front of a door She slips between two
buildings and moves around toward the side of the building
they are guarding

Hans watches from the shadows across the street Hes about
to move across to cut her off when he notices the two guards
EXCHANGE A LOOK Theres no doubt the guards have seen Olga
but have done nothing Hans pulls up short confusedand
concerned

ANGLE Olga as she reaches the side of the building in the
alley out of Hans sight She peers through a boarded up
window

Olga Pov She can just make out the figure of a man slumped
forward in a chair in the corner of the raom The same chair
and spot where we saw Schmidt earlier Theres no one else in
the room

Olga begins quickly and quietly pulling boards away from the
opening

EXT STREET - NIGHT

General Ottomeyer exits the building and steps into a waiting
staff car Hes back in uniform

crawl through the window

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

guards outside)
Get in here

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

From across the street Hans watches as the guards RUSH

inside the building He has not been able to make out what
was said from inside As he watches Ottomeyers car pulls to
the door in the alley

The guards drag Olga out as Ottomeyer steps from the car
Ottomeyer SLAPS Olga HARD across the face

OTTOMEYER
(to Olga loudly)
Did you really think I would be so
easy to deceive you pathetic
Little slut

Hans has moved close enough to hear this exchange

The guards drag Olga into the back of the car As the car
speeds away Hochstetter steps up next to Ottomeyer Their
conversation to low for Hans to’hear though he is ‘trying to

HOCHSTETTER
The Gestapo thanks you General

OTTOMEYER
I dont care what Herbert Kleimper
does to Klink or even toa
Burkhalter But if you turn him on
me you will find that I am not so
easy an enemy

The two men lock eyestwo despicable men engaging in an
uneasy truce Over their look we HEAR the STATIC of a
radio
INT RADIO ROOM NIGHT

The men are gathered at the table The radio in the center A
plate of homemade cookies sets near the radio The men take

and eat cookies throughout the scene Just static and
squelching coming from the radio

KINCH
No luck Colonel We just dont

have enough juice to break through
the Germans frequency jamming

HOGAN
We have to find a way to boost the
power

NEWKIRK

With all those Gestapo agents at
Burhalters theres got to be a
high-powered radio we can lift

HOGAN
That doesnt help us tonight

CARTER
I dont think we have much tine
Colonel I didnt like the looks of
Earhart and that German scientist
together today They were awfully
chummy

NEWKIRK
What did you expect him to be
Carter Earhart has to make then
believe hes one of them

CARTER
It was more than that Newkirk
Those two guys knew each
otherfor more than a day

HOGAN
London wouldnt have sent Earhart
if they werent certain of him
Carter Hes one of us

CARTER
Im not so certain youd feel that
way if you saw what I saw

HOGAN
For now we have to assume
Eatharts just doing what he was
assigned to do Well get a radio
tomorrow and get some answers from
London

off their looks of concern
EXT STALAG 13 - EARLY MORNING

Our guys are sound asleep They havent had much sleep
lately Herbert and the quards burst into the room LOUD

GUARD
Attention

Hogan and the men are startled What the hell is this

HERBERT
Everyone up Morning roll call

The men stagger to their feet Hogan exchanges a discrete
roll of the eyes with Schultz then looks out the window

HOGAN
I dont see any sign of morning

HERBERT
Were going to be starting the day
a little earlier from now on You
have 15 minutes to report to the
yard Breakfast will be served in

Help

Hogan offers a determined nod as Schultz exits

KINCH
Can you believe that son of a
bitch
CARTER
Its 530
LEBEAU

EXT STALAG-13 - EARLY MORNING

Still dark Men are lined up in the yard Herbert paces as he
addresses then

HERBERT
Roll call will be 545 every
morning Lights out will be nine
oclock

A collective groan from the men

HERBERT
(snaps) -
There will be no talking in
formation Ever You are prisoners
of war and you are going to be
treated as such

Just then Colonel Klinks door flies open Klink emerges
Hes dressed in a night shirt (that goes to his ankles) Hes
disheveled What hair he has is at wild angles Monocle
dangling from his neck Hes obviously just crawled out of
bed Klink will hate the new earlier mornings more than
anyone He bolts across the yard in his bare feet Without
the monocle to his eye he really cant see very well

KLINK
What is the meaning of this Why
are you men out of your barracks in
the middle of the night

Herbert steps in front of Klink Impossible to miss him now
Klink is startledand a little afraid He puts the monocle
to one eye as hé steps back a few paces

‘ HERBERT
I ordered them out And it is not
the middie of the night Colonel
Klink Its 545 Time for everyone
in this camp to be up and working

Herberts eyes wonder over Klinks garish bed clothes Even
Klink gets the inference

Co eneeeticat ie es

KLINK

Of course Captain Kleimper I was
just writing reports to
headquarters

(firm voice to the

assembled men)
What are you looking at You should
be at the mess hall DISMISSED

The prisoners break formation and amble toward the mess hall

HERBERT
Colonel Hogan

Hogan turns back

HERBERT
Your men will report to General
Burhalters in one hour Sergeant
Schultz will be accompanying you as
your guard

Klink and Hogan are both surprised by this new information

KLINK
Sergeant Schultz
KLEIMPER
Do you have a problem with that
Colonel
KLINK
Nono
KLEIMPER

(with subtext)
Is that a problem for you Colonel
Hogan

HOGAN
None Schultz will be a valuable
addition to your wedding security

Hogan and Klempér hold stares for a beat Neither backing
down Klink oblivious to the meaning of the exchange between
Hogan and Kleimper

HERBERT
(to Klink)
Perhaps you should get dressed
before’ joining us at the mess hall
Coionel Klink
Herbert walks away without letting Klink respond Flustered
Klinks monocle falls away from his eye Hes all flying hair
and nightgown as he tries to catch the misplaced eyepiece

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - LABORATORY - MORNING

The scientists are gathered around the table They dre in the
middle of a discussion During Earharts speech he makes eye
contact with Bischoff several times

SCIENTIST 1
What about graphite

EARHART
There are reports that the allies
are experimenting using graphite
rather deuterium oxide to
facilitate the atomic reaction I
have done detailed calculations
trying to substantiate the process
but can find no evidence that this
would work

BISCHOFF
Do you believe its worth exploring
further

EARHART

Nothing in my research suggests
that it would be Especially since
we have only three months

(slight hesitation)
But Im willing to try if you think
we should pursue it

Eye contact between them We have no idea what is passing
between these twobut something is

The door to the laboratory opens and in steps Major
Hochstetter Hes accompanied by another Gestapo agent All
conversation stops when the Gestapo enters

HOCHSTETTER
(slightly ominous)
Gentlemen Sorry to interrupt your
work We need to speak privately
with Herr Bishoff and Herr Kloiber

Tension fills the room Private meetings with the Gestapo are
not considered good news Bishoff and Earhart stand

HOCHSTETTER
Herr Bisoff if you will come with
me Herr Kloiber you will go with
my associate

Bisoff follows Hochstetter out Earhart goes with the other
Gestapo agent The other scientists exchange fearful glances

INT BURKHALTER KITCHEN MORNING

LeBeau enters Heads straight for his apron and puts it on
We want him to reach into that pocketit feels like hes
going to but just then Elsa enters Shes just gotten
‘upstill in her bathrobe Make no mistake you wouldnt
want to wake up next to this woman

ELSA
Make me breakfast immediately
Eggs bacon and hot cakes And none
of those little French portions
Im famished this morning Herbert
slipped into my room last night
The man is an animal

LEBEAU
No arguing that

Elsa doesnt catch the sarcasm
ELSA
Ill be back in 15 minutes Have
the food on the table
She exits
INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - DAY

Hochstetter enters Bishoff on his heels As soon as the door
closes both mens demeanor changes No fear from Bischoff

HOCHSTETTER
What do you think

BISHOFF
Hes an accomplished scientist He
will be of great help to us here

HOCHSTETTER
But is he Klaus Kloiber

BISCHOFF
Without question

HOCHSTETTER
(a little

70
confrontational)
Youre sure

BISCHOFF
We havent seen each other in 20
years but hes changed very

Little

HOCHSTETTER
Our intelligence in London feels
that the allies were planning a
switch Kloiber is the only
possible candidate His cousin
Earhart defected years ago We have
nothing on him since but they
looked very much alike when they
were younger

BISCHOFF
Either our intelligence is wrong
or the allies failed The man
working in our lab is Klaus
Kloiber Id bet my life on it

HOCHSTETTER
You have

Hochstetter stares a hole through Bischoff looking for any
doubt There isnt any

INT BURKHALTER HOUSE - DAY

Hogan and Schultz start UP the stairs toward the second

Colonel Hogan I really think I
should be guarding LeBeau in the
kitchen

HOGAN
Hell save something special for
you This morning Newkirk and
Carter need guarding upstairs

SCHULTZ
But Colonel Hogan those cookies
LeBeau is baking smell so good

Hogan suddenly stops Raises his hand for Schultz to be
quiet Something out the window has caught his attention
HOGAN
(to Schultz)
Wait here

Hogan moves to the window and Slowly opens it an inch or so

Hogans POV Standing outside 20 feet away from the window
are Major Hochstetter and Herbert They are engaged in what
appears to be friendly conversation From all appearances
these two know each other well Herbert LAUGHS at something
Hochstetter says

Hogan bends to the cracked window to try and listen Cant
make out anything Irritated and troubled by the sight of
Hochstetter and Herbert together he closes the window and
goes back to Schultz

HOGAN
Lets go

SCHULTZ
What were you doing

Hogan shoots him a look

SCHULTZ
I “know nothing

EXT BURKHALTER ESTATE - BARN - DAY

of the bag then looks around discretely He tucks the bag
into a hiding place in the corner of the barn

INT SEWING ROOM DAY

CLOSE ON a needle being PULLED THROUGH the heavy drape
fabric Its slow going pulling the needle through this
fabric Carters hands come into frame trying to help him
hold the drape in place as its sewn

As they work the needle BOOM UP the sewing dummy to find
that the pillows have now been replaced by Schultz The huge
white dressdrape fits him pretty damn good Hes looking
down watching them work Embarrassed and frustrated

SCHULTZ
How much longer

CARTER
Dont be so anxious to get out of

Colonel Im glad youre here

LeBeau reaches into his apron and pulls out the paper that
Earhart left Hands it to Hogan

LEBEAU
I found this in my apron

Hogan reads Intrigued

HOGAN
It wasnt in there yesterday

LEBEAU
No

Hogan reads the paper again

HOGAN
Get this up to the sewing room to
Carter If its a code of some kind
maybe he can figure it out

LeBeau takes the paper and exits
INT TUNNEL - DAY

CLOSE ON the equations on the chalkboard We HEAR the
scratching sound of Klaus digging as we pan over to find that
hes made considerable progress He tugs on the bolt
Nothing He tugs again using his feet to brace against the
wall After several attempts the bolt breaks free Klaus is
thrown to the floor but hes giddy at having succeeded

Klaus stands Looks toward the entrance to the radio room
then back toward the entrance where Hogan brought him in He
has no idea whats up the ladder But he knows the German
countryside awaits at the other end of the tunnel

Klaus takes the sure bet He crawls into the tunnel leading
out

EXT BURKHALTER ESTATE - BARN - DAY

Several German jeeps have been pulled into the barn Kinch is

HOGAN
Not far from here Get the maps
Lets see if we can figure out
whats there

Carter moves to the bunk and exits below

You put that in there didnt you

CARTER
Dont start with me Newkirk No

expect

HOGAN
He must have gone out through the
tunnel and not up Otherwise there
would have been a firing squad
waiting for us when we came back

Where are you going

HOGAN
To‘ see HansI think Olga may be in
some trouble If you dont find him

questioning Olga

HOGAN
Find out where she is Hans As
soon as the Gestapo realizes she
wont talk theyll kill her

been outside this camp without
guard for even a moment since the
day he arrived here more than a
year ago

KLAUS
He kidnapped me at the train
station in Hamburg three days ago
He and his men have been holding me
captive while my cousin
impersonates me at a meeting of top
German scientists called by the
Fuerher

KLINK
If there was a special meeting
taking place in this area thé
Fuerher would have insisted that I
be informed

Klaus knows that Klink is a pompous incompetent ass But he
also knows that he needs Klink to get out of here

KLAUS
I cannot explain the Fuerhers
oversight But I can assure you
that Colonel Hogan has been holding
me captive Hes been forcing me to
build a hot water heater so that he

immediately

He expressed some concern about the
timing There is a lot of Nazi
activity in the area right now
-Weve even had trouble making radio
contact with Stalag 13 He said
that if they ha not terminated the

they would not be able to carry out

Germans will have significant anti-
aircraft support there To have any
hope of success from the air well

need to send two squadrons of
bombers to try and overwhelm their

question I asked Can we be
prepared to try and take out that
Plant tonight

slightly

Whats the latest we can hit the
target and still get our planes
back before daylight

nodded

Between two and two-thirty am

still standing when they get there
tell them to drop everything they
have Maybe well get lucky and one
of those bombs will actually hit
something

Hogan moves the gun to the base of Herberts skull

HOGAN
(close in Herberts ear)
Dont even breath

The guard moves closer then passes in the opposite
direction Hogan’ turns Herbertslightly so that he can keep
the guard in sight and still focus on Herbert Once the guard
has moved away Hogan checks his watch

Hogan turns Herbert back in the direction they were going
They move off

EXT POWER PLANT GENERATORCAR - NIGHT

The guard from the gate has spotted the empty staff car He
approaches with caution Looks inside the car confused that
it is empty

GUARD
Major Kleimper
The lack of response makes the guard even more suspicious He
starts toward a building 50 yards away
EXT POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Hogan and Herbert are crouched down behind several LARGE FUEL
TANKS They are pretty well hidden Hogans eyes constantly
sweep the areaon full alert

Suddenly LIGHTS START COMING ON at various points around the
plant Several guards can be seen in the distance running
toward the area where Hogan left the car Over the roar of
the plant German voices can now be heard hollering
instructions

Herbert smiles a confident smile

HERBERT
Complications perhaps

Hogan checks his watch 214
EXT POWER PLANT - GENERATORCAR- NIGHT

Guard 1 has been joined by several other armed guards now
They have the car surrounded but they dont really know why

An irritated officer joins then
102

OFFICER
(challenging)
What is the meaning of this

“GUARD 1
A Gestapo Major entered the plant
about 20 minutes ago in this car

OFFICER
Where is he now

GUARD 1
I dont know I alerted you as soon
as I realized he was not with the

car

OFFICER
Did he state the reason for his
arrival

GUARD 1

Only that he was on orders from the

Fuerher His identification was in

order
The officer is conflicted Something doesnt seem right here
yet if he moves too fast and interferes with a Gestapo
operation it could be his head

OFFICER
Alert perimeter security I will
wait here for him to return

GUARD 1
Yes sir

The guard scurries away The officer begins pacing along the
back of the car Within inches of the ticking bomb

EXT POWER PLANT NIGHT

Hogan and Herbert are still crouched down by the tank No
sign of guards and no voices now Everyone is over by the
car out of Hogans view Hogan checks his watch 218

HOGAN
Time to move

He nudges Herbert up and toward the front gate Careful to
keep in the shadows

EXT POWER PLANT - GENERATORCAR NIGHT

The officer takes a package of cigarettes from his pocket as
he paces As he pulls one from the pack he drops it on the
ground right below the trunk He bends to pick up the
cigarette Stops SNIFFS SMELLING SOMETHING COMING FROM THE
TRUNK It obviously doesnt smell good

He looks around really curious now Only a couple of guards
who have remained with him A beat then he presses the latch
on the trunk and opens the lid The MANURE SMELL is released
by opening the trunk lid and the officer takes a half step
back getting away from the first wave of odor

He collects himself and step back to look into the trunk

Officers POV The sacks of manure and fertilizer bound
together with a time and a detonator The timer is at THREE
SECONDS and counting

Just enough time for the officer to realize what has happened
before A HUGE EXPLOSION ENDS HIS LIFE BLOWS THE STAFF CAR
APART AND BEGINS ENOUGH DESTRUCTION OF THE POWER PLANT TO
KEEP ANYTHING from being produced there for awhile

fire in the distance below is getting bigger

EXT POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Hogan and Herbert watch the explosion from a spot near the
front gate Its quite a fireworks show It takes a beat
then CHAOS breaks out Guards and plant personnel begin
streaming out of buildings Fire fighting crews leap into
action Seemingly every live body at the ‘plant is running
towards the explosion

HOGAN ‘
Time to take our leave

Hogan motions Herbert toward the front gate They reach the
gate and slip out

HOGAN
That way

Hogan points to the woods about 20 yards from the perimeter
fence Just as they start to move that direction Guard 2
who was left behind steps from his booth

GUARD 2
Halt
Herbert wheels toward the guard and throws himself to the
side As he does

HERBERT
(hollering to be heard)
Sabotage He is an American

In one motion Hogan raises his run and SHOOTS the guard
through the chest

The first explosion is starting to trigger other
explosionsthe whole plant is going up

Herbert uses Hogans attention being pulled away to lunge at
him Hogan turns back and fires a shot hitting Herbert in
the leg at close range Herbert falls to the ground Hogan
stands over hin

HERBERT
Go ahead Kill me
HOGAN
If I had wanted you dead you would

be

Hogan pulls Herbert to his feet Herbert has to lean against
him to stand
105

HOGAN
Youre going back to London and
have a nice long chat with Allied
intelligence about goings on at the
Gestapo

HERBERT
I can force you to kill me

HOGAN
Id rather leave you here for the
Gestapo to find But thats not
such a good option for you Ina
couple of days some anonymous
source would reveal your heritage
and youd be on a train to one of
those death camps we keep hearing
about Trust me Herbert a British
POW camp is a far better option
that being a Jew in Germany

Herberts expression acknowledges that truth

HOGAN
We have a lot of ground to cover
and’ not much time

With Herbert leaning against Hogan they move off into the
woods The fires from the explosion still RAGING OUT OF
CONTROL behind them

They take only a few steps when the FIRST BOMB HITS It hits
about 50 yards in front of themnowhere near the plant but
close enough to Hogan and Herbert to throw them through the
air

Its tough to tell if either of them has been hurt badly As
they lie on the ground bombs continue to fallgetting
progressively farther from the plant Not a single bomb
hitting within a 100 yards of the target

to Bischoff)
Most of the bombs that fell missed
the power plant entirely but the
explosion inside did considerable
damage It will be months before we
have it operating again

BISCHOFF
And you believe the sabotage and
Kleimpers disappearance are

related
HOCHSTETTER
(sarcastic)
Very good

Bischoff delivers a little sarcasm himself

BISCHOFF
It would appear your man Kleimper
has been busy

Hochstetter stops

HOCHSTETTER
That is how it would appear isnt
it Herr Bischoff

BISCHOFF
You have doubts

HOCHSTETTER
Its too obvious The woman escapes
--Kleimper disappearsand our
hydroelectric plant is blown up
from the inside Things are seldom
as simple as they first appear are
they

Hochstetter looks to Ottomeyer and Bischoff Neither says
anything Not a question they wish to be answering right now

the scientists immediately If the
allies knew about the hydroelectric
plant they may know that we are
keeping them here Notify them to

entered He sees them climbing the stairs to the second
floor Still carrying the food he follows them up the
stairs

Kleiner first

Bischoff steers Ottomeyer toward Earharts room

INT EARHARTS ROOM - DAY

Earhart is dressed A small bag packed at the end of his bed
There is a HARD RAP on the door followed by Bischoff and

Ottomeyer entering the room without being invited

OTTOMEYER
Lets have a look at what youve
packed

Ottomeyers POV Inside the bag are two shirts Ottomeyer

papers

Ottomeyer lifts several papers out Complicated formulas and
research hand written on the pagers

OTTOMEYER
(to Earhart)
How did you know to pack Herr
Kleiner We just received the order
ourselves

Bischoff has moved to the side of the room away from Earhart

BISCHOFF (0S)
He was leaving anyway

Ottomeyer turns to Bischoff Shocked to find Bischoff
pointing a pistol with a silencer screwed to the end at hin

Bischoff FIRES THE GUN SHOOTING OTTOMEYER in the chest
Ottomeyers expression is of stunned disbelief as he falls to
the floor dead

Bischoff hands the gun to Earhart as they begin to pull
Ottomeyers body into the closet

BISCHOFF
Take this

EARHART
I dont know how to use it

BISCHOFF
If they capture you just point it
at yourself and pull the trigger
It will be the better alternative

Earhart looks hard at Bischoff then takes the gun and sticks
it in the back of his waistband

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Hogan ear near the door has heard the MUFFLED SILENCER
SOUND Damn hes too late

He moves back down the hall in the direction he came Hes
about 10 strides away when Earharts door opens Hogan looks
back surprised to see Earhart and Bishoff exit Bischoff
carries the bag as they quickly move toward Hogan Hogan
slows allowing them to catch him

When they are a stride behind him Hogan quickly wheels
dropping the tray ONTO a startled Bischoff While Bischoff is
knocked off balance Hogan PULLS a pistol and levels it at
him Hes going to shoot Bischoff

EARHART
No

Hogan is shocked Earhart picks up ‘the bag that Bischoff
dropped

EARHART ‘
Hes with me

Bischoff leaps to his feet startsputting the food back on
the tray

HOGAN
What the hell is going on

EARHART
Michael and I went to school
together many years ago Hes been
protecting me since the first day
Hes leaving with me

HOGAN
We cant take five Theres no

Tv
His research can change the war
Im not going without him

No doubt that Earhart means it

HOGAN
Well bump a passenger Lets go

Bischoff hands the tray toward Hogan

BISCHOFF
(to Hogan)
Take this and give me your gun

Hogan looks at him like hes crazy

BISCHOFF
Theres too much activity on the
first floor If they catch a worker
with a gun even one they think is
German theyll shoot you without
asking questions

Big decision for Hogan whether to trust Bischoff or not Hes
skeptical

EARHART
Give it to hin

Hogans and Earharts eyes meet Hogan believes in him Hands

the gun to Bischoff
HOGAN

stay about 10 feet in front of me

Were going to the kitchen I can

get you out from there

They move out Down the stairs
INT FIRST FLOOR - DAY

Bischoff and Earhart reach the bottom of the stairs then
turn toward the dining room Two guards pass by but they do
not pay particular interest to Earhart and Bischoff Looks
like they are going to get to the kitchen without incident

Hogan is still on the stairs when

HOCHSTETTER (0S)
Herr Bischoff you are going the
wrong way

ANGLE to find Hochstetter in the library doorway Hes been
watching the activity He waited to speak until he was
certain that Bischoff was leading Earhart the wrong way

BISCHOFF
I was just going to get a drink of
water before we came in

Hogan has stopped on the stairs watching From this position
Bischoff and Earhart can see Hogan but Hochstetter can not

HOCHSTETTER
I have water here Please come in

Hogan watches as Bischoff and Earhart move toward the
library

Hogan sets the tray down on the stairs taking a LARGE
SERVING SPOON from the tray as he does He motions for
Bischoff to get Hochstetter out of the library

Bischoff stops near the bottom of the stairs sets the bag
down opposite the stairs

BISCHOFF
(to Hochstetter)
Before we begin perhaps you should
take a look at this

ANGLE Hochstetter Hes suspicious But hes also arrogant
Bischoff is baiting him and he knows jit but hes not about
to appear weak Hochstetter moves to the bag bends to open
it

As he bends Hogan comes down the stairs and sticks the
handle end of the spoon in the small of Hochstetters back
Feels like a gun

HOGAN
Theres been a slight change of
plan Major
(to Earhart)
Wheres the lab

EARHART

Hochstetter)

Hochstetters kidney

have nothing left to lose

Hochstetter glances at him Knows he means it Bischoff and
Earhart push Hochstetter toward the back stairs Hogan heads
for the kitchen

protected by the Geneva Convention
This will be better than being shot
or hung Youll be dying for a good
causeours

(to Newkirk)
Get him out of those clothes and
tie him up But dont make it too
obvious ‘

Newkirk starts pulling Herberts uniform coat off Hogan
checks his watch Smiles and shakes his head as he realizes
that its probably not accurate anyway

HOGAN
(to Earhart and
Bischoff)
No rushyou have five minutes

‘ EARHART
More than enough time

Everything seems back on track Suddenly Herbert swings
wildlylanding a BLOW to Newkirks jaw Newkirk falls over
a table and Herbert LURCHES FOR THE STAIRS in his underwear
His wounded leg keeps him from moving very fast but he has
enough of a head start that he might make it to the top
before they can catch hin
Herberts foot hits the third step up when we HEAR a PFFFTTT
SOUND Herbert falls backwards down the stairs shot in the
back DEAD

ANGLE to find Earhart holding the gun with the silencer
Everyone is shocked that it was Earhart that fired the shot

HOGAN
I thought you said youd never
‘fired a gun

EARHART

In matters of espionage Colonel
Hogan it is wise to hold a little
of the truth only for yourself

HOGAN
(sly smile back)
Ill remember that
