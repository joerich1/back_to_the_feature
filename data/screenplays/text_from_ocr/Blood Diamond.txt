THESE WORDS APPEAR
SIERRA LEONE 1999
INT - A HUT - BEFORE DAWN
A MANS HAND hardworking rough lights twigs under a kettle

Predawn light trickles through the tin walls onto well worn
farming tools-hoe pick axe a yoke for an ox Animist
totems and charms hang We are in a typical Mende FARMERS
HUT Except for the ENGLISH SCHOOLBOOKS on a shelf

The HAND that lit the kettle takes the books off the shelf
and gently nudges a 14-year-old BOY awake with them The
boy DIA is his name groans in sleepy protest

SOLOMON VANDY smiles down at his son

SOLOMON
(in Mende subtitled)
Dont want to be late

The boy sits up half asleep Sleepily pulls a shirt over
his head His English is more schooled than his fathers

DIA
(in Mende subtitled)
English boys go to school every day

Solomon fills a tin cup of powdered milk He is a man marked
by quiet patience in the worn trousers and white cotton
shirt of a Mende farmer He hands the cup to the boy

SOLOMON
in Mende subtitled)
Yes they do

DIA
(in Mende subtitled)
Not every day

SOLOMON
(in Mende subtitled)
Every day Just like you So you
can become a doctor Not walk behind
an ox like your father

The boy catches his MOTHERs eye as she breast-feeds his
INFANT BROTHER His twelve-year old sister NYANDA snuggles
with them She sticks her tongue out at her brother

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Dont worry She will be joining
you next year

JASSIE sends both her men a kiss as they head out
JASSIE
(in Mende subtitled)
Be careful on the road

Solomon gives his wife an I know look
EXT HUT - VILLAGE CONTINUOUS

Solomon and Dia emerge into the early light Their hut is
in a hamlet amidst cassava patches eeked out of the jungle

DIA
Dont want to be a doctor
(of£ Solomons look)
I want to be President

Solomon puts his arm around him They head into the fields
CREDITS OVER

SOLOMON AS HE WORKS IN THE FIELDS IT IS A TIMELESS
PICTURE ONE OF PASTORAL BEAUTY AND SIMPLICITY

AT NOONTIME JASSTE AND NYANDA GRING LUNCH THEY SIT IN
THE SHADE OF A HUGE BEOBOB TREE

DIA RETURNS HOME CARRYING HIS SCHOOLBOOKS NOW HE WORKS
BESIDE HIS FATHER

THE SUN IS ALREADY LOW AS THEY RETURN TO THE VILLAGE
CREDITS END

Solomon stands stock still sensing something A few
chickens flit away without crowing The oxen are skittish

SOLOMON
Go back inside NOW

Dia is confused Solomon pushes him into the hut as grinning
TEENAGE REBELS appear One wears a Tupac t-shirt He rakes
everything with AK-47 FIRE Huts Animals People

Solomon dives to the ground VILLAGERS run screaming
Chickens squawk oxen bray A rumble Two mud-splattered
PICK-UP TRUCKS with sawed-off roofs crash through the brush
full of RUF REBELS who quickly jump off -- shouting
wielding machetes and automatic rifles BANDOLIERS OF AMMO
criss-crossed on their bare chests GRENADES on their belts

Solomon cowers amidst the gunfire looks around frantically
Men and boys are being rounded up Huts set on fire
Suddenly he is yanked up as two REBELS pull him away--

Jassie exits their hut infant in her arms mad with fear --
JASSIE
Solomon

He shouts back Only one word

SOLOMON
Run

She doesnt She just stands there screaming his name Now
Solomons son and daughter come out of the hut

DIA
PAPA

Solomon the rifle choking him as hes dragged away

SOLOMON
RUN

Jassie grabs her sons arm He resists staring in anguish

at his father But she tugs at him And with the two younger
children in tow they join others Running

Solomon watches them disappear into the bush

IN THE NEXT MOMENT

hes rounded up with the OTHER MALES Only a few able-bodied
among them Most are old skinny men and terrified boys

REBELS prod them with rifles making them form a line All
under the watchful sunglasses of an RUF COLONEL

The FIRST VILLAGER is shoved to his knees in front of a tree
stump A muscle-bound SHIRTLESS REBEL with a gleaming AXE
struts over his eyes glazed from palm wine and marijuana

A second rebel grabs the village mans HAND and places it on
the stump The man pulls his hand away Tupac t-shirt puts
the Ak-47 to his head

The choice is clear Your head or your hands

The villager tries to scramble away RAT-A-TAT Bullet
through his head The choice is made for him

The next man in line is made to kneel at the stump

TUPAC T-SHIRT
Long sleeve or short sleeve

The other stoned rebels find this hilarious

ON SOLOMON witnessing his mutilation as terrified WAILS
rise around him The discarded limb is thrown into a bag

The next in line A STRONG YOUNG MAN is pushed to the stump

RUF COLONEL
Not him He can work

The STRONG YOUNG MAN is herded into a waiting truck Next
comes AN OLD MAN Shaking he offers his withered hand

ON SOLOMON The “crunch of the axe bores into his soul

The old man is lifted to his feet in clinical shock Both
his forearms end in bloody stumps

RUF COLONEL (CONTD)
You are the messenger Spread the
word Guvment say da future is in
your hands We say RUF is da
future Revolution is at hand

Solomon is next He closes his eyes as his hand is placed
on the tree stump slick with blood The Colonel looks him
over Motions the henchmen to stop

RU F COLONEL
You will need your hands

Solomon is herded into the truck
EXT SIERRA LEONE -- (SEEN FROM ABOVE) 8

A seaplane soars above the bush At the stick DANNY ARCHER
He has seen more in his thirty years than most people have
seen in a lifetime of watching bad television

He scans the landscape then dips toward the estuary of a
broad river eventually splashing to a stop

NEARBY ON THE SANDY BANK 9

Sitting in a lawn chair is COMMANDER RAMBO a twenty year-
old RUF fighter with a goatee wrap-around sunglasses
and a Bob Marley t-shirt Arrayed behind him several
BODYGUARDS cradle automatic weapons while eating mandms A
huge BOOM BOX throbs out Tupacs If I Die 2Nite”

INT COCKPIT 10

FAWAZ a thin Lebanese man sits beside Archer and eyes the
rebels waiting on the riverbank Murmurs a prayer in Arabic

ARCHER
Say one for me my friend

Archer closes his eyes for a moment then checks the clip on
his 9mm Sig-Sauer before tucking it into his belt and pulling
his shirt-tails over it Takes a deep breath

EXT ON SHORE 11

Archer wades in and approaches the group Imagine teenagers
on a corner in Bed-Sty carrying AK-47s Their menace is
palpable even as they laugh and pass around a big spliff

ARCHER
You are Colonel Zero

COMMANDER RAMBO
I am Commander Rambo

ARCHER
What happened to Colonel Zero

No response A few of the rebels giggle

COMMANDER RAMBO
He was not committed to the
revolution You are here to help us
in our struggle against the oppressor

ARCHER
Im here to do business

They eye each other in silence

ARCHER (CONTD)
You have something for me

COMMANDER RAMBO
First you will show me what you have
brought

ARCHER
No First you will pay for them

Rambo looks at him with dead eyes Archer looks back with
eyes equally dead A nasty stand-off Until Rambo hands
him a small filthy cloth SACK Archer tips a few rough
diamonds into his hand

ARCHER (CONTD)
(in Krio subtitled)
This is not what was agreed

COMANDER RAMBO
(in Krio subtitled)
Maybe I will take the weapons and
give you nothing

Archer closes his eyes again looks back at the seaplane
The cargo door SLIDES OPEN revealing the muzzle of a M-130
Assault Weapon Fawaz racks its slide

In response the Rebels slide the bolts on their weapons
11A

ARCHER
(in Krio subtitled)
Maybe Ill just do my business with
the government At least the
oppressor pays his bills

He turns and starts back toward the plane

COMMANDER RAMBO
Wait Wait

Rambo smiles as if it has all been a joke He reaches into

a rusty coffee can and pulls out a huge handful of diamonds

COMMANDER RAMBO (CONTD)

This is what you want Here So
many I dont know what to do with
them all

He gestures for Archer to hold out his hands and pours him a
handful

COMMANDER
You bring a satellite dish next time
yah I want to watch NYPD Blue

MOMENTS LATER 11A

As the seaplane takes off we see the rebels unloading crates
of RPGs with Ukranian markings

INT PLANE 12
Fawaz gleefully examines their haul

FAWAZ
I‘tm buying an electronics store
Sit on my ass all day drink sweet
tea and watch dvds How about it
Danny

Archer closes his eyes for a moment He is free

ARCHER
Fly the plane

EXT DIAMOND FIELD - SIERRA LEONE - DAY 13

An open pit alluvial mine carved beside a jungle river Men
and boys toil knee deep in muddy water They dig with their
hands shoveling silt into wooden troughs All under the
watchful eyes and guns of RUF REBELS who stand on the
banks passing a fat joint rolled in newspaper

Meanwhile their leader - CAPTAIN POISON -- spouts twisted
revolutionary dogma to the diggers
CAPTAIN POISON
The Freetown guv-a-ment and their
white masters have raped your land
to feed their greed We have freed
you No more slave and master here
We are all brothers

Solomon his back straining under the weight of a circular
sieve pauses to wipe sweat from his eyes Hes prodded
with a rifle looks up into the fierce FACE of Captain Poison

CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
Back to work Your work is your
liberation Work harder Dig harder

Solomon turns back to his sieve ANOTHER DIGGER peers into
his sieve plucks something out holds it up in his hand

DIGGER
Kunaa

All work stops A rebel comes over The digger hands him
the tiny milky crystal A diamond Without a word the
Commander wraps the stone in a piece of paper

As work resumes Solomon watches the piece of paper handed

off to a RUNNER who runs it over to the SAME COMMANDER who
sits under the shade of a palm frond umbrella reading a
Hustler magazine He stuffs the diamond into his shirt pocket
without even looking at it

Across from Solomon a 3RD DIGGER glances around Furtively
picks a stone from the sieve and slips it into his mouth

He meets Solomons eyes Solomon looks away keeps working
When he becomes aware of Captain Poisons eyes on him
Solomon tries to shake off the eyes by shaking the sieve

Captain Poison remains staring at him intently Then calmly
walks over to the 3rd digger with the diamond in his mouth
AND SHOOTS HIM at point blank range

Everything stops Poison turns back to Solomon

CAPTAIN POISON
You Bring him out

Solomon puts down his sieve Looks at the BODY floating
next to him turning the muddy water red

SOLOMON (V0)
Dear Jassie I cannot write well
enough to put ina letter all the
thoughts in my head

EXT RUF DIAMOND CAMP - SUNSET 14

Solomon devours a meager portion of rice gruel in a tin cup
Others sleep in their fetid clothes on the ground

SOLOMON (V0O)
Even if I could my guards would not
let me send it

EXT DIAMOND CAMP - NIGHT 15

Solomon sits shivering looking out at the guards on watch
Beyond a lit TENT where rebels drink and shout back at a
satellite TV playing Who Wants To Be a Millionaire”

SOLOMON (VO)
I do not know where you are I do
not even know where I am

EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE BINTUMANI FOOTHILLS 16

Jassie and the children are among a group of homeless Mende
Dia carries the infant Hearing trucks coming they scatter
into the bush An RUF convoy roars past After a moment
they return to the road

SOLOMON (V0O)
I only know that my thoughts fly
over the mountains to you

EXT BED OF GRASS NIGHT 17
Solomon lays there Eyes open in a living nightmare
SOLOMON (V0)

I will find you Jassie If it takes

my whole life We will be together
EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY 18
A high pass Misty peaks in the distance A BRILLIANT RED
SHAPE comes into view - the bright headdress of a HAUSA
SHEPHERD He carries a spear as he leads a herd of GOATS
bells clinking around their necks

Picking up the rear is Archer checking a handheld GPS His
SATELLITE PHONE buzzes
ARCHER
Were two clicks from the strip
Whatve you got
EXTINT TWIN ENGINE TURBO PROP - FLYING SAME 19

Piloted by Fawaz He speaks into his SAT phone worriedly
looking down on the dense jungle canopy

FAWAZ
-Company

EXT MOUNTAINS - SAME 20

Sure enough over the hill comes an armed patrol of ECOMOG
SOLDIERS The TROOP LEADER approaches Archer

TROOP LEADER
Papers

Archer fishes out identification Hands it over

ARCHER
Elliot Smith National Geographic

TROOP LEADER
You are crossing into Liberia

ARCHER

I have a letter from the Minister of
Interior and a Liberian visa as well

(as the Captain studies

the papers)
Doing a story on the Hausa who as
you know are allowed to cross the
border to get to grazing grounds

Up above the tiny plane drones past The troop leader
glances up then at Archer who courteously offers an unopened
pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket

ARCHER (CONTD)
Ever read National Geographic

The troop leader ignores him walks over to a goat and runs
his hands down the goats back under its chin His hands
part a tuft of hair -- revealing a surgically straight line
of STITCHES in the goats skin

Archer feels the shape of the 9mm under his shirt looks
around at the rifles Too Many of them

The troop leader takes out KNIFE and cuts into the stitches
The goat squeals a little and kicks angrily From under the
goats skin he takes a dozen small rough DIAMONDS

The troop leader draws his -45 on Archer

TROOP LEADER
You are under arrest for smuggling

ARCHER
Now you listen here my man I ama
good friend of Minister Somora He
will not be pleased you have
interfered with his business

Clearly the name of Minister Somora carries some weight

ARCHER (CONTD)
You know who I am dont you What
Ioam I dont think you want to
mess with me Or my friends eh
(changes his tack)
How about I just look the other way
and you pocket one or two of those
stones Buy something nice for the
wife Or maybe the mistress eh
(re the shepherds)
Whos going to tell Them

The shepherds look uncertain from Archer to the soldier

TROOP LEADER
No

The troop leader FIRES One of the shepherds falls dead

The other is cut down as he tries to flee The leader frowns

at Archer whose world has suddenly turned upside down

TROOP LEADER (CONTD)
We will go back to Freetown and ask
Minister Somora how he wishes to
thank his business associate

INT AN ANONYMOUS ROOM -- DAY

Archer is handcuffed to a chair A large rotund FIGURE
enters silhouetted against the bright windows

ARCHER
Mr Minister there seems to have
been a terrible misunderst--

SOMORA BACKHANDS him Archers head rocks backwards

MINISTER SOMORA
I thought we were friends

ARCHER
Youre right youre right I
took a little initiative but--

Another SLAP

MINISTER SOMORA
Have I not been good to you

ARCHER
(licks his split lip)
Absolutely And I was planning to
cut you in Havent I always been--

li

This SLAP knocks Archers chair backwards to the cement He
lies there for a moment Somora looms over him

ARCHER (CONTD)
Look if you wanted to kill me
you wouldve done it already So
what is it you want me to do

Somora smiles One of his teeth has a tiny diamond
INT THE UNITED NATIONS - NEW YORK - DAY
The SECRETARY GENERAL of the UN addresses a a full ASSEMBLY

SECRETARY GENERAL
We propose then to prohibit the direct
or indirect import of all rough
diamonds from conflict zones to the
territory of Member States

He looks at the front row where TWO MEN IN SAVILLE ROW SUITS
sit among the Representatives One is sandy-haired 40 his
name is SIMMONS He serves a distinguished-looking older
man 60 with a shock of white hair His name is DE WENTE

SECRETARY GENERAL (CONTD)
As we know these stones are only a
small percentage of the legitimate
diamond industry -- whose trade is
crucial to the economies of several
emerging nations and I applaud their
support of such a ban

The well-dressed diamond industry reps smile back

LATER - CHAMPAGNE IS SERVED

in a reception hall The Diamond industry REPS and WIVES
mingle with UN MEMBERS and other DIGNITARIES US AMBASSADOR
WALKER approaches De Wente holds out his hand

AMBASSADOR WALKER

Mister De Wente Judd Walker--
DE WENTE

Ambassador Good to finally meet

you

AMBASSADOR WALKER
You dont spend much time this side
of the Atlantic

DE WENTE
Im hoping to change that Perhaps
with your help

AMBASSADOR WALKER
Mr De Wente Im afraid I dont
have much faith in any industrys
ability to police itself

DE WENTE
I assure you sir we both want the
same thing These conflict stones
put the legitimacy of our entire
business at risk

De Wentes young blonde WIFE appears at his side Its hard
to decide which is more beautiful the woman or the two-
million-dollar DIAMOND NECKLACE shes wearing

DE WENTE (CONTD)
Darling This is Ambassador Walker

DE WENTES WIFE
How nice to meet you

DE WENTE
(his arm around her)
Its my belief Ambassador that
diamonds should be associated with
romance and beauty Not warfare
Dont you agree

How can the Ambassador not be dazzled From the glittering
diamonds we cut to

EXT DIAMOND FIELD - PIT - DAY

Solomon works in the muddy water his eyes transfixed by the
sparkling reflections of the river and the swaying trees
that seem so unaffected by the brutality beneath

SOLOMON (V0)
Dear Jassie How can it be that one
stone is worth more than another

Solomon wills himself back to the soul-killing work

Suddenly a WATER PUMP BREAKS -- gushing like a fire hose --
knocking over Solomon and several diggers Solomons sieve
is swept down river He swims after the SIEVE Grabs it
sloshing his way back when he stops

There underwater by the riverbank is something SHINY ENOUGH
to reflect the sun As the silt washes away the object
remains underwater A ROCK of a startling pink color

Solomon blinks down at it The DIAMOND sparkles up at him

SOLOMON (V0) (CONTD)
And how can a thing that comes from
our mother the earth be so beautiful
as to make people want to kill

Solomon locks around Rebel guards are fixing the pump
shouting at diggers to get back to work

Solomon scoops the diamond into his sieve covers it with
silt His heart is pounding as he wades back to the bank

REBEL GUARD
You daydreaming Get back to work

Solomon nods Quickly submerges his silt-heaped sieve
EXT UNDERNEATH THE MUDDY WATER - CONTINUOUS

Solomon overturns the sieve His BARE FOOT catches the
diamond

EXT ABOVE THE WATER - SAME

Solomon raises his hand to get the guards attention He
clutches his abdomen painfully

SOLOMON
I must go badly
(pleading)
Cant hold it in boss

The guard motions him out Solomon climbs out sliding his
second foot carefully He shuffles to the edge of the jungle

CAPTAIN POISON
Stop

Solomon freezes Poison searches Solomon Starting with
his hair his ears nose Squeezing his cheeks to see into
his mouth Frisking his pants unrolling his cuffs

CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
Lift your foot

Solomon lifts his right foot They check between his toes

CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
The other

Solomon looking into Poisons eyes lifts his left foot
Poison checks between the toes Satisfied

CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
Make it quick

CLOSE ON SOLOMONS FOOT as he lowers it The toes curl
into the soft muddy earth obviously retrieving something

EXT EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER 27

As Solomon squats behind a fallen tree he eyes the guards
through the broad leaves

Quickly his toes release the muddy gob under his foot He
rubs the mud off it Its raw beauty is almost unnatural

He glances back to make sure he is unobserved and then rips
the cuff off his pants

A CLICK at his head
Solomon slowly looks up into the BARREL OF A COLT 45

CAPTAIN POISON
Give it to me

Solomon doesnt move What difference does it make He
awaits the crack of the gun when

A MORTAR ROUND COMES SCREAMING OUT OF THE JUNGLE

THE EXPLOSION knocks Solomon to the ground

MORE MORTARS ECOMOG government troops appear firing
automatic weapons Solomon scrambles over to Poisons bleeding
body removes the MACHETE from the belt

As shrapnel shreds the greenery he furiously digs with the
machete Wraps the DIAMOND in his TORN GREEN CUFF and plants
it in the hole

When he is STRUCK IN THE HEAD BY A RIFLE BUTT

He falls ECOMOG SOLDIERS are shouting at him in Mende
Solomon realizes he still holds the machete lets it drop

SOLOMON
Dont shoot I am not RUF

Around him ECOMOG soldiers beat the rebel prisoners with
sticks -- in the distance others are EXECUTED at random

EXT FREETOWN - DAY 28
A convoy of MILITARY TRUCKS rolls through teeming streets

Women walk with baskets on their heads tribal bells jingling
around their ankles Businessmen in white suits sip Coca-
Colas outside a hotel A UN helicopter circles overhead

EXT BACK OF A MILITARY TRUCK - SAME 29

Solomon sits chained to other rebel prisoners Hes never
been to a city never seen so many people Its overwhelming

is

He stares at the BEGGARS who run alongside War orphans
the same age as his own son He searches every face

INT FREETOWN PRISON (PADEMBA ROAD) -- DAY

Archer looks up from a game of solitaire as REBEL PRISONERS
are marched past his dank cell

REBEL 1
RUF is coming Operation Chop
Hands Get ready my brothers

Archer turns his attention back to his game as the cell door
next to his is opened and Solomon is thrown in

SOLOMON

I am not RUF My name is Solomon

Vandy I ama farmer
Archer assesses him Solomon gives him a hard stare
MORE PRISONERS are brought in one carried on a stretcher
A bandage covers half his face But when he turns his head
we see that its Captain Poison Solomon turns away
Poison lifts his head squinting through the CELL BARS

CAPTAIN POISON
What did you do with it

Solomon doesnt acknowledge Poison
CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
Im talking to you You hear me
Where is the diamond

Archer pricks up his ears but goes on playing solitaire

CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
A pink diamond I saw you take it

Archers hand flipping over a card stops Listening
intently now but careful not to show it

SOLOMON
You are mad I do not know you

CAPTAIN POISON
I saw it with my own eyes

Poison reaches into his sweat stained shirt an IVORY CHARM
from around his neck Holds it up for all to see

CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
This big Biggest I have ever seen

Solomon just shakes his head absurdly

BUT ARCHERS EYESare on the ivory charm even as he keeps
playing solitaire Poison calls to the guards

CAPTAIN POISON (CONTD)
I will give a thousand dollars to
the man who cuts it out of him

These words do something to Solomon He stands and rips off
his shirt Then his torn pants Everything Until he stands
completely naked facing Captain Poison through the bars

SOLOMON
Where is a diamond Do you see a
diamond You devils have taken my
family My home Everything Here
Look What is left What is left
If there is a diamond then you are
the one who has taken it

Poison lifts his upper body from the stretcher

CAPTAIN POISON
Liar Hes a LIAR

The army guards have had enough They silence Poison with a
rifle butt to the face As they drag him away they give
Solomon a “got my eye on you too glare

Archer lays out a new hand of solitaire His eyes move to
Solomon then away Hes heard all he has to

Solomon begins putting his clothes back on The fury still
in his eyes Through the bars he gives Archer a final glare
Archer turns away just keeps playing cards
But then ever so carefully he picks out the ACE OF
DIAMONDS Folds it in half He gets up and goes to his
cell door Waits until a PRISON GUARD passes by
ARCHER
Excuse me brother Think you could
get a message to Minister Somora

The prison guard sees the PACK OF CIGARETTES - and the folded
card - that Archer holds through the bars

EXT PRISON GATE - NEXT DAY 31
Archer walks out into the street blinks in the sunlight
ACROSS THE STREET THE SAME SCENE

is observed in the REARVIEW MIRROR of a parked car by a man
with a reddish crewcut His name is JOOST

FAWAZ appears and hands Archer his hat

FAWAZ
How on earth did you get them to let
you go

ARCHER

Theres a farmer in there He
mightve found a pink

FAWAZ
And what You told Somora youd get
hold of it

ARCHER
I need to contact our friends in
London

FAWAZ

I thought we were working for Somora

ARCHER
Who needs Somora if the pink is real

Archer can tell that Fawaz is holding something back

ARCHER (CONTD)

What

FAWAZ
London wants nothing more to do with
you

Fawaz hands him a newspaper clipping

ARCHER

(reads)
The arrest in Sierra Leone on June
One of Daniel Archer former mercenary
and smuggler with ties to the De
Wente diamond cartel highlights the
trafficking problem blah blah blah

(crumples it)
Fucking hell

He starts off down the street calling over his shoulder
ARCHER (CONTD)
His name is Solomon something
Mortgage the plane if you have to --
just get him out
32 INT A SHABBY ROOM IN AN APARTMENT HOTEL -- DAY

Dripping wet from a shower Archer is working the phone

ARCHER
(on the phone)
sees Well can you tell Mr De Wente
Danny Archer calledArcher
AR
JUMP CUT - LATER - ANOTHER CALL
Archer smokes his tenth cigarette
ARCHER (CONTD)
(on the phone)

Archer pounds his fist into a wall
ARCHER (CONTD)
Yes he definitely knows what this

In frustration he throws the phone across the room
EXT FREETOWN STREET -- DAY

Archer leaves the shabby hotel having changed clothes He

is mobbed by the inevitable swarm of beggars who call him by

nameArrr-cherrr Arrr-cherr

ARCHER
Piss off

He pushes his way past without a trace of compassion
MEANWHILE -- THE DOOR TO ARCHERS HOTEL ROOM IS KICKED OPEN

JOOST the man we saw surveilling Archer enters and begins

to SEARCH the room He is professional and brutal -- ripping

apart bedding smashing the phone machine even slitting the
carpet into thin strips with a razor blade

It is clear he is looking for something quite small
EXT BEACH BAR -- DAY

Every war zone has a place like this Soldiers smugglers
opportunists of every stripe stand shoulder to shoulder at a
bamboo bar Bad guys and dogooders UN workers and eco-
backpackers drink overpriced watered-down liquor trade
gossip and hook up for desperate expatriate sex Sierra
Afrique blends African drums and electric bass

Every now and then in the distant hills the muted SOUND OF
AN EXPLOSION and a rising COLUMN OF SMOKE No one pays any
attention There is serious drinking to be done

As Archer shoulders his way past we OVERHEAR brief snippets
of conversation A Nigerian peacekeeper hits on a tipsy
blond Red Cross Worker

PEACEKEEPER
This place is nothing but hustlers
and dopers I will take you back to
Nigeria Show you the real Africa

RED CROSS WORKER
Is that so

He whispers in her ear and she giggles Next to them two
SUITS from the Chemical Bank

SUIT 1
- Fifty thousand in cash And thats
just to get a meeting with him

SUIT 2
The only difference between the crooks
who run the country and the RUF--

The AFRICAN BARTENDER (MED) serves their drinks

AFRICAN BARTENDER (MED)
--is fifty miles Word on de street
dey took Marampa yesterday

He points up into the hills where another explosion rises

AFRICAN BARTENDER (MED) (CONTD)
Time to reconfirm dose flight
reservations maybe

Archer approaches the bar His arrival is cause for several
whispered remarks among those in the know

AFRICAN BARTENDER (MED) (CONTD)
How de body Mr Archer

ARCHER
Every day above ground Med
(looks to the hills)
Your rebel friends planning to visit
us one of these days

AFRICAN BARTENDER (MED)
Oh I magine dey come do some
shopping verrry soon

He laughs darkly Archer salutes him with his drink Nearby
an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN taps her swizzle stick on the bar as
Oasis Party Like Its 99 ends

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
This is the Voice of America Another
good day on Wall Street the Dow
Jones up twenty-five points the
Nasdaq up forty In the White House
President Clinton again defended his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky--

The woman near Archer speaks up

WOMAN
Are you listening to this The
worlds falling apart and all we
hear about is Blowjobgate

Archer turns to MADDY BOWEN Maddys a handful whose beauty
belies the kind of fierce intelligence that sends most men
running for the door Archer likes what he sees

ARCHER
Whens the last time the world wasnt
falling apart

MADDY
Oh A realist Been there done

ARCHER
Danny Archer

MADDY
Maddy Bowen

Maddy raises an eyebrow He plays rough She likes it

MADDY
Ouch

ARCHER

MADDY

Archer smiles Its been a long time since he was interested

ARCHER

See that guy Government minister

money Bad move know why Wasnt
giving a big enough cut to his boss

(points nearby)
That one Sells AK-47s to the
rebels and waits for a cease-fire to

the fighting starts again sells
them back at a profit

MADDY
And your point is

ARCHER
The point is its Africa There is

Archer catches Meds eye -- who nods approvingly at Maddy

ARCHER

Med Same again
MADDY

ARCHER
(offering nothing)

Archer just smiles

MADDY (CONTD)

ARCHER

MADDY
Diamonds

ARCEER

MADDY
(laughs)
For De Wente

ARCHER
Its not just rude to ask those kind

MADDY

(leans closer)
So tell me about blood diamonds

And then suddenly Archer gets it His face turns to stone

ARCHER
Youre a journalist

MADDY
Thats right

Archer stands up from his stool

ARCHER
Piss off

He throws some money onto the bar Maddy follows him out
EXT BEACH BAR -- CONTINUOUS

MADDY
De Wente Diamonds closed its buying
offices here to avoid UN sanctions
But theyre using cut-outs to buy
stones from the rebels on the cheap
That way nobody accuses them of
profiting from the war --which they
clearly are

ARCHER

INT ARCHERS HOTEL ROOM -- AFTERNOON (MUSIC OVER)

Archer walks in and sees the

wreckage of his life

IN THE BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER (MUSIC OVER)

Archer stares at himself in

the remains of his mirror He

opens a bottle of vodka and chugs it

A FLASH CUT -- GRAINY BLACK and WHITE

South African Security Forces BREAK DOWN a door and roust a
sleeping middle-aged ANC supporter from his bed His wife

SCREAMS as Archer puts a bag

BACK TO THE BATHROOM

over the mans head

Archer takes a long pull of vodka and tosses the bottle
With a pliers he grips a false crown atop A BACK TOOTH

ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- GRAINY BLACK and WHITE

The Black prisoner is naked
what is being done to him
as he watches

tied to a chair We do not see
Instead we study Archers face

BACK TO THE BATHROOM

Bright drops of blood drip into the sink Ignoring the
incredible pain Archer rips out the crown

Into his palm he taps a bloody ROUGH DIAMOND

leans in to light Archers cigarette--

ARCHER GRABS HIS HEAD AND SMASHES IT DOWN ONTO HIS UP-THRUST
KNEE LOW-PUNCHES HIM IN THE GROIN SWEEPS HIS LEGS OUT FROM

Simmons adjusts the trousers of his bespoke suit Hed rather
talk about anything but business but if Archer insists

SIMMONS

A month ago officers of this company
sat in front of the United Nations
and pledged to uphold a ban on

We are no longer accepting the stones

Archer looks around Realizes

ARCHER

ARCHER (CONTD)
Youre losing your hold on the global
market Big finds in Russia Canada
You need me more than ever

Simmons glances at his watch

SIMMONS
You dont plan to lecture me on the

ARCHER
The trade Oh that has such a nicer
ring to it than “cartel” Cartel
is for Columbian drug dealers and
oil sheiks Its so unbecoming

Archer stands and walks to a FRAMED WALL PHOTO of the
distinguished older MAN whom we last saw at the UN

ARCHER
(continuing over him)
--Which is why it would be a shame
if say another company got all the
press not the mention the profits
from the largest pink ever to find
its way to market-

This pulls Simmons up short

SIMMONS
Youre bluffing

ARCHER
Probably But if Im not youre
going to be the one having to explain
to Mr De Wente how it happened

He stands and starts out
ARCHER (CONTD)

Nice talking to you Reg Love the

An abandoned school Men women with babies swaddled in
tribal cloth They are impatient unruly

Solomon sees the line snaking around the block He walks
casually toward the front acting as if he knows someone

SOLOMON
Hello my brother Hows de body

REFUGEE 1
Do I know you

Solomon insinuates himself beside him in line
SOLOMON
Sure sure We met at your cousins
wedding Dont you remember

Another refugee farther back in line calls out angrily

REFUGEE 2
Back in line

Other refugees join in calling “end of the line etc
Solomon ignores them focusing on the man beside him

SOLOMON
--and how is the happy couple

The angry refugee GRABS Solomon by the arm

REFUGEE 2
Hey mon who you think you are

Solomon turns on him with quiet menace

SOLOMON
If you dont let go I will break
your arm Then I will break your
head

The wild look in Solomons eye is truly terrifying The man
recoils in fear The other refugees stop their grumbling

INSIDE THE OFFICE
Hundreds of NAMES posted on reams of paper cover the walls

Solomon searches the list methodically Even as hes shoved
and pushed he holds his ground The names he seeks are not
there

SOLOMON (V0)
Dear Jassie Can it be that no one
in our country has a home

He looks around for someone in authority Hears an African
SOLDIER speaking Mende

SOLOMON (CONTD)
(in Mende subtitled)
Please I must talk to someone My
familys name is not on the list

The soldier who is being yelled at by five other people
simultaneously replies angrily in subtitled Mende

MENDE SOLDIER
Go to Kambe there is another list

SOLOMON
I have been to Kambe and Mombolo
and Tibili and--

MENDE SOLDIER
Talk to the whites

He points to a harried RED CROSS OFFICIAL who fields an
onslaught of questions Solomon pushes his way to him

SOLOMON
Excuse me sir my name is--

RED CROSS OFFICIAL
--Check the list

SOLOMON
I have checked the lists

The Brit shouts to be heard over the tumult

Two square-jawed MERCENARIES emerge from the Mercedes the
outline of handguns obvious beneath the tails of their shirts

Archer smiles darkly

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
They want us to take back the diamond
mines and I need someone who knows
his way around up there

Archer just takes another sip The Colonel studies him

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
According to our Minister Somora
youve got something in the works
Somethingpink

ARCHER

The fantasy of some Mende farmer

THE COLONEL
There is the small matter of payment
on some RPGs You havent forgotten
who arranged that shipment from our
Ukranian friends

ARCHER
But who is it I wonder who tipped
off the ECOMOG to the goat routine

The Colonels tone loses some of its warmth

Half of its SIGN has been blown away A filthy red carpet
leads to a colonial facade

Solomon in a red vest that serves as a uniform carries a
businessmans bags As the businessman gets into a cab a
pack of Marlboro 100s falls out of the mans pocket

SOLOMON (V0)

pockets the cigarettes

EXT FREETOWN STREET -- DAY 62

the cassava crop

INT HOSPITAL - DAY 63
Solomon bribes a UNICEF OFFICIAL with the currency

He walks past rows of civilian casualties many of them
children He forces himself to smile at each face he passes

EXT SQUATTERS CAMP -- NIGHT 64

Places like this define every city in the third world
Solomon has taken residence in the rusted hull of an old
car It is bare except for an extra shirt folded neatly

SOLOMON (VO)
Most of all I miss our family all
together in the hut at night the
sound of the childrens’ breathing
and your warmth beside me

He lights a candle before a wooden animist statue

SOLOMON (VO) (CONTD)
Whenever I feel myself losing hope
I think of these things and I know
it will be all right

Dia is held down by two rebels as a cut is opened in his arm
and an unidentified powdery drug is poured into the cut

Archer gets out of a cab carrying his bag His face is
swollen and sunglasses cover a black eye

A MILITARY JEEP is parked in front of his hotel Several
ECOMOG troops loiter perhaps waiting for him perhaps not

Not taking any chances Archer turns away

He turns away

Fawaz approaches He is a nervous wreck

FAWAZ
Oh my God are you all right

ARCHER
Wheres the farmer

FAWAZ
He found a job at a hotel Spends
all his time at the refugee offices
Not exactly the behavior of a man in
possession of a priceless stone

Another EXPLOSION in the distant hills Fawaz flinches

FAWAZ (CONTD)
The main road to Masiaka is cut in
three places The governments gonna
fall any second and Im following
some delusional farmer

Archer sees Maddy through the crowd Shes standing apart
looking somewhat dazed as she moves slowly to the music

FAWAZ (CONTD)
The man was a digger The odds of
him getting away with even a small
stone is zero They slit you open
alive just for sweating

ARCHER
I think Somora is looking for me

FAWAZ
(really worried now)
Allah forfend

ARCHER
(moving away)
Just stay on the farmer

FAWAZ
But--

Archer has already begun heading toward Maddy She sees him
coming and watches him walk toward her They meet in the
middle of a crowded dance floor All around them sweaty
bodies are swaying to the African beat

MADDY
Am I supposed to kiss you or fuck
you I cant remember

ARCHER
How about you dance with me
MADDY
Should I ask what happened to your

face
He takes her hand and leads her into the surging crowd

MADDY (CONTD)
I guess not

They dance as best they can in the crush
MADDY (CONTD)

This is insane Im drunk in an
African bar dancing with a mercenary

ARCHER

What would they say in Ohio
MADDY

Chicago
ARCHER

You can tell a lot about someone
by the way they dance

MADDY
Then you can probably tell right
away that I cant dance

They look at each other

MADDY (CONTD)
In Mozambique you were part of a
search-and-destroy unit targeting
ANC leaders Then in Angola you
hooked up with De Wente and started
trading guns for diamonds

ARCKER
Is this on the record

MADDY
But you blew it all getting greedy
and trying to go it alone Why

He doesnt answer They are looking at each other The
music is pounding Sweat is pouring off both of them but
neither bothers to wipe it away

They keep

MADDY (CONTD)
So youre what a Nihilist
Opportunist Scumbag

ARCHER
Maybe I just wasnt breast-fed in
childhood

MADDY
You think Ive never met people like
you

ARCHER
I think you get off on people like
me

MADDY
Fuck you

ARCHER
That too

dancing their faces very close

MADDY
What Illnever understand is
howyou cancompartmentalize
human suffering

He stops dancing Looks at her

ARCHER
Thanks for the dance

He walks away

OUTSIDE THE BAR 72

He lights a cigarette She appears and stands quietly beside
him Together they watch the distant explosions

MADDY
I didnt actually hurt your feelings

He takes a long drag Exhales

ARCHER
How long you been in Africa
MADDY
Four months Before that Kosovo
ARCHER
Okay How many Blacks do you know
back in the States -- besides the

girl who cleans your house and the
man who picks up your garbage

MADDY
Whats that got to do with it

ARCHER
I know Blacks Grew up with ‘em
fought with ‘em Behind the calm
eyes and the gentle smile theyre
burning with hate for what weve
done to em They hate you hate me
hate each other and hate themselves
And your bleeding heart isnt gonna
stop ‘em butchering each other
Half the continent is starving and
the rest is dying of AIDS while their
leaders sell medicine to build palaces
and drive Mercedes

MADDY
That doesnt make it right

ARCHER
No it doesnt But apart from a few
do-gooders who show up for a week
with their flak jackets their
laptops and their little bottles of
hand sanitizer the White world doesnt
give a fuck about the Black world
Look at Sudan Look at Rwanda
Your country loses thirty-four marines
in Somalia and then does nothing as
a million people die Except put
pictures of starving children on TV
to flagellate their guilty conscience
(MORE)

ARCHER (CONTD)
(shakes his head)
So someones got to do the dirty
work-- you think America doesn’t
sell arms or hire professionals
You call them ‘contractors’ I sell
guns If I dont somebody else will

MADDY
The law of the jungle
(sighs)
If only I had a nickel for every
piece-of-shit who uses it to justify
his existence

He turns to look at her her face radiant with sweat

ARCHER
I like your smell

MADDY
Well that makes me weak at the knees

ARCHER
Its all gonna blow any minute You
should get out

MADDY
An ECOMOG relief column leaves in
the morning What about you

ARCHER
Business to finish up

MADDY
What could possibly be worth staying
and getting yourself killed over

He looks at her offers a grim smile

MADDY (CONTD)
Oh Right

He indicates the bare “wedding ring finger of her left hand

ARCHER
Tell me you never dreamt of having a
sparkly diamond of your very own

Peace

EXT SQUATTER CAMP -- NEXT DAY
Solomon emerges from his rusted hulk to find Archer waiting

Archer looks as if hes been up all night avoiding the
Ministers troops -- which in fact he has

ARCHER
What did you do bury it

Solomon instinctively looks to see if anyone is listening

ARCHER (CONTD)
I would have buried it

SOLOMON
(heart racing)
What are you talking about

Archer removes his sunglasses looks Solomon in the eye

ARCHER
What am I talking about

SOLOMON
I must go to work

Archer follows as Solomon walks through the shantytown

ARCHER
My friend Fawaz paid an awfully large
bribe to get you out of jail

SOLOMON
I will pay Mister Fawaz back He
has my word And now you have my
word And we have finished speaking

Solomon runs for a crowded bus Archer watches him disappear
74 INT EXECUTIVE HOTEL -- LATER THAT DAY 74

Solomon is carrying bags for Western businessmen frantic to
get out of Freetown before its too late

Depositing their bags in a taxi he walks back into the lobby
to find Archer leaning against a post smoking a cigarette

ARCHER
Why would that RUF captain with
the bandaged eye make up such a story

Solomon again tries to ignore him

ARCHER (CONTD)
What are you going to do sell it
yourself To who For how much
You need help friend whether you
want it or not

Another porter is eavesdropping Solomon escapes into the
alley beside the hotel turns on Archer

75 EXT ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

SOLOMON
I know who you are And what you
are Men like you have turned my
country into a land of thieves and
killers I do not need your help

ARCHER
What if I could help find your family

At these words something feral appears in Solomons eyes

SOLOMON
What do you know of my family

ARCHER
The relief agencies are useless the
hospitals are overwhelmed There
are other ways

SOLOMON
Liar

ARCHER
I know people White people

Solomon LUNGES -- pinning Archer against the wall Archer
could fight He doesnt

ARCHER (CONTD)
Therightstone--

Solomon wants nothing more than to strangle him but he also
intuits Archer might be his only hope He relaxes his grip

ARCHER (CONTD)
-can buy anything Information
Safety Even freedom But a big
stone doesnt stay secret The minute
you show it your life is worthless
Im guessing the only reason youre
still alive is because you havent
told anyone where it is Right

Archers pitch -- fueled by desperation -- is mesmerizing

ARCHER (CONTD)
The last pink to come out of Africa
fetched ten million dollars I know
because I carried it out You know
what I got for it

He opens his shirt A HUGE SCAR crosses his chest

ARCHER (CONTD)
I was lucky I learned that a man
will do anything for a diamond

SOLOMON
You would say anything How can I
trust you--

NEARBY THE CRUMP OF AN EXPLOSION FOLLOWED BY THE CHATTER
OF AUTOMATIC WEAPONSFROM A BLOCK OR TWO AWAY

ARCHER
Hear that Its started They
mustve snuck into the city overnight
(looks at Solomon)
Whats it gonna be friend
A BLOCK AWAY

Three cut-down trucks of Rebels SQUEAL into view and begin
spraying everything with automatic weapons

ARCHER (CONTD)
Yes or no

A whole life can change with a single syllable

SOLOMON
Yes

A TRUCK COMES CAREENING AROUND THE CORNER Archer pushes
Solomon as the wall behind them is stitched with bullets

ARCHER
Go GO

They begin to run

THEY RUN THROUGH THE CITY

Their fates suddenly joined by the need to stay alive

And death lurks at every corner

Bands of teenagers roam the streets FIRING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS
at anything that moves Signs store windows cars Urban

Rap dopplers past as trucks with boom boxes speed by

At an intersection an impromptu ROADBLOCK People are pulled
out of cars and beaten while their cars are set on fire

Archer and Solomon double back and sprint past the Executive
hotel where a gang of Rebels are entering From inside comes
the sound of SCREAMING and more GUNFIRE

People are being taken -- black and white alike -- and forced
into trucks MINISTER SOMORA is led away at gunpoint

44

Women are dragged by the hair into alleyways A man is thrown
out of a fourth-story window

In fact it was much worse than anything we can ever show
Archer and Solomon continue to run for their lives

Storefronts are looted Its impossible to tell the rebels
from the civilians Adults carry televisions Two men carry
a barca-lounger Teenage boys wear womens wigs and throw
molotov cocktails made from Swedish vodka Rebel teenagers
are sacking The Beach Bar -- drinking everything in sight
Med lies dead splayed across the bar

Archer and Solomon run through the darkening streets as
rockets light up the sky

Agun battle between retreating government soldiers and
advancing rebels traps them in a crossfire

They dive into a restaurant doorway taking refuge with others
huddled terrified on the floor Windows are shot out as
rounds rip in and plaster rains down on their heads

After a deafening moment -- quiet Archer watches through a
crack in the door as ECOMOG troops are lined up against a
wall and executed

HOURS LATER - DARK AT LAST 77

Archer and Solomon set off again

They do their best to stay in shadows hugging the walls of
pock-marked buildings as they try to sneak past the roving
patrols and trucks filled with men and out of the city

SOLOMON
Howmuchfarther
ARCHER
Soonerorlaterwell be in
the bush
AN HALF-HOUR LATER 78

They are still running
Both men are exhausted filthy with soot and sweat their

chests heaving But neither even considers Stopping Around
them the houses are becoming fewer

UP AHEAD - AN OPEN FIELD 719

And then another Nothing beyond except a tangle of banana
trees ruined cassava groves and the densely-covered hills

ARCHER
There--

With renewed energy they pick themselves up and run

THE SOUND OF VOICES -- CLOSE AT HAND

Sends them DIVING into a ditch

Three RUF soldiers are setting up a machine gun Solomon
looks around wildly There is nowhere to go If they are
still there by daybreak they will be discovered If they
try to run they will be shot

A look of resolve steals over Archers face as he reaches

into his boot for his knife Without a backward glance he
slithers out of the ditch

THE KILLING OF THE THREE SOLDIERS 80
Is a deadly ballet Ones throat is slit the second is

gutted But his weapon FIRES -- alerting the third soldier

who whirls -- just in time for his body to be stitched by

rounds from the dead mans AK-47 -- which Archer now holds

It has all happened in a matter of seconds But the gunfire
has alerted more soldiers from nearby

ARCHER
COME ON

Archer and Solomon take off into the field -- as TRACERS
soon begin to streak past

AT LAST THEY BREAK INTO THE BRUSH 81

Vines whipping against their faces thorns ripping their
hands and clothes - until long after the gunfire has stopped

Atlast they stop
Bent over double Gasping for breath in the humid night

Alive

The two men look at one another They could never articulate
it but both intuitively know this will be the defining
journey of their lives

EXT MAKENI ROAD -- DAWN (FROM HIGH ABOVE) 82

In Cambodia in El Salvador in Sudan as in Sierra Leone
the image of a downtrodden dispossessed multitude traveling
on foot toward an uncertain end has become the signature
image of our time It is the Age of the Refugee

Archer and Solomon trudge amidst the throng Ox-drawn carts
and thousands of shuffling feet churn up a sea of dust

SOLOMON
Where are we going

ARCHER
Theres a relief camp in Port Loki
Journalists will have access toa
SAT-phone Ill have Fawaz meet us
with the plane

SOLOMON
I have agreed to nothing

Archer looks straight ahead as he walks

ARCHER
You will

LATER -- 84

Archer and Solomon are broiling under a relentless sun
Solomon searches every passing face Archer dozes

MADDY (0S)
You got out

ARCHER
Hello Maddy This is Solomon Vandy

MADDY
How do you do
(to Archer all
business)
Im on deadline and Ive been waiting
four hours to use a SAT-phone What
do you want to tell me

Archer moves her out of Solomons earshot

ARCHER
An outfit named Star Mines is buying
blood diamonds

MADDY
And

ARCHER
De Wente has no visible ties to Star --
but through a maze of crossholdings
and offshore banks they own it In
violation of the very trade embargo
they pledged to uphold

MADDY
You have proof of this
(he nods)
And youll go on record

He looks at her

ARCHER
If you help me out
MADDY
I knew it
ARCHER
Before you say anything -- the man

is a Mende farmer His village was
burned to the ground He was forced
to work the mines but his family
fled -- wife and three children
Hes been trying to find them but
hes drowning in red tape

Maddy looks again at Solomon

MADDY
How do you even know this man

ARCHER
I know him

Maddy looks back at Archer

MADDY
Youre using me

ARCHER

And youre using me Isnt that how
it works

(leaning in)
You want to make a difference Maddy
Start with this man Youve got
access to UN databases you know
all the NG0Os

MADDY
Look around Archer What difference
does helping one man make
He looks at her

MADDY (CONTD)
Jesus Did I really say that

Maddys eyes remain on his conflicted as we HEAR the BEATING
OF HELICOPTER BLADES

EXTINT UNHCR HELICOPTER - DAY 85

LOOKING DOWN on a sweep of grassland on which a sea of
flapping white tents suddenly appearsthousands of them

MADDY (V0O)
There it is

INT HELICOPTER - SAME 86

Solomon Archer and Maddy have hitched a ride on a UN
chopper Solomons never been up in one He stares down at
the sprawling tent city below

MADDY
At the moment the second largest
refugee camp in Africa

SOLOMON
My wife is here In Guinea

Maddy reads from the computer manifest in her hand

MADDY
Jassie Vandy Kono District Crossed
into Guinea six weeks ago

SOLOMON
Six weeks And my children

Maddy hesitates folds the manifest then just nods

MADDY
You would have found them Sometimes
it takes a year before new manifests
reach the field offices
(glances at Archer)
I was lucky to get access to the
UNHCR database

SOLOMON
I do not know how to thank you

What can Maddy say She nods
EXT REFUGEE CAMP - DAY 87

Archer Solomon and Maddy step off the chopper to find-- A
SEA OF HUMANITY behind a CHAIN FENCE stretching for miles

WORKERS with World Food Program armbands unload supplies as
REFUGEES rush the fence pressing forward shouting

MADDY
This is what a million people look
like
Solomon stares These are his people

CLOSE ON ARCHER taking it all in Hes seen pretty much
everything there is to see in life But no one is unaffected

MADDY (CONTD)
You might catch a minute of this on
CNN somewhere between weather and
sports

As they approach the fence Solomon sees that many of the
refugees are AMPUTEES Some reaching through the chain link
with stumps of arms Solomons heart is pounding

MADDY (CONTD)
It says theyre in Sector Two

Solomon follows as Maddy shows her BADGE to a UN GUARD who
reads her slip of paper and points out the right direction

Archer stares through the fence at two KIDS each with one
leg yet managing to kick a plastic jug back and forth

Other amputees stare sullenly A sign reads “NO PHOTOS FOR
JOURNALISTS WITHOUT

A WRINKLED OLD MAN blows his lips at Archer through the fence
Archer walks on The old man shadows him Until Archer
realizes the fellow is gesturing to the cigarettes in his
shirt pocket Archer takes out a cigarette is about to

Slip one through the fence --

When he sees the man has no hands

Grimly Archer sticks the cigarette in the mans mouth
Then moves on

EXT REFUGEE CAMP - SECTOR TWO GATE - LATER
A FRENCH UN GUARD relays the paper to an AFRICAN WFP MONITOR

FRENCH GUARD
Stay at the fence Quarantine

Solomon grips the fence watching the WFP monitor as he
disappears into the teeming mass

Archer has rejoined them He notices Maddys expression

ARCHER
Whats wrong

Maddy shakes her head But Archer can tell shes keeping
something from him

Solomon catches sight of the WFP monitor He has a woman
with him A woman carrying a little boy and a young girl

SOLOMON
Jassie
(and then hes sure)
Jassie JASSIE

Jassie hears her name looks up through the hordes of people

JASSIE
Solo SOLO

SOLOMON
JASSIE

Solomons face morphs from disbelief to joy as Jassie runs
through a crush of bodies to him --

Their fingers GRASP each others through the fence They run
their hands over each others faces unable to speak

Solomon looks at the one-year-old in her arms an infant
when last he saw him He touches him through the fence
The girl silent offers a weak smile Shes seen too much

Then Solomon looks around puzzled
SOLOMON (CONTD)
Dia
(to Jassie in Mende)
Where is Dia
The boy is nowhere in sight

SCLOMON (CONTD)
Where is my son

Watching this Archer turns to Maddy

ARCHER
He has a son who goes to school
reads English

MADDY
There were only two children listed
on the manifest

ARCHER
--What

Maddy turns away her eyes brimming
AT THE FENCE Solomon reads Jassies eyes

SOLOMON
Where is he

She rubs her cheek against his hand her body trembling

JASSIE
Theytook him

Solomon looks at her incomprehensibly And the words come
out in a flood of Mende - that breaks into a WAIL of grief

Solomon drops to the ground as if every muscle in his body
had been cut He struggles for breath

Archer cannot watch their grief yet cannot turn away

ARCHER
Fuck this

A GUARD tries to pry Solomons hands from the fence but he
wont let go Sensing trouble the guard calls ANOTHER GUARD
over Both of them try to pull Solomon from the fence

SOLOMON
Let them out

Jassie doesnt let go of her husbands hands

JASSIE
Solo Solo

Solomon starts shaking the fence

SOLOMON
Let them out

The guards begin to beat his hands with their rifle butts
But Solomon keeps shaking the fence as if to uproot the steel
posts

SOLOMON (CONTD)
LET THEM OUT

Archer puts himself between Solomon and the guards

ARCHER
Get off him

A guard points his rifle and shouts in an unknown dialect

ARCHER (CONTD)
Fine Just get off him

INT HELICOPTER - LATER 89

Archer and Maddy ride in silence Solomon stares out the
chopper window His knuckles bandaged Devoid of emotion

MADDY
Theyre afraid some of the refugees
might be rebels They wont be
released until theres a cease-fire
Im sorry

Solomon stares out at the distant fog-shrouded mountains

SOLOMON
What you want Mister Archer is
beyond those hills That is where I
buried it

Archers heart skips a beat What was only spoken of is now

real

Maddy looks at Solomon his face knotted in grief And then
back at Archer She is putting the pieces together

EXT ECOMOG STAGING AREA - MASTIAKA - EVENING 30
Maddy marches away from the helicopter

ARCHER
Maddy wait

He grabs her arm She wrenches free of his grip
ARCHER (CONTD)

I didnt take his son Dont pin
that on me

MADDY
I pin it on all of us Especially
you

ARCHER

Yah we fucked the black man My
father did and my grandfather before
him Now the black man fucks himself
Tell me something I dont know

Tired furious done with sparring she walks off
EXT ECOMOG STAGING AREA -- MASIAKA -- NIGHT 91

Solomon and Archer huddle beside a fire Around them are
hundreds of fires each with huddled figures silhouetted

Solomons sharpens the blade of a MACHETE with a whetstone
Archer pores over a MAP with a flashlight

ARCHER
You say the mine is near the Moa
River Where exactly on this map
Solomon’s eyes remain on the machete blade

SOLOMON
I do not need a map

ARCHER
Well I do

We follow his finger ON THE MAP as he talks

ARCHER (CONTD)
Were here The press convoy is
going to Kailahun Diamond mines
are here Where did you bury it

He looks over and sees that Solomon is CUTTING a line up one
arm with the machete drawing blood

ARCHER (CONTD)
You understand when we get to
Kailahun were gonna have to go
overland You better damn well be
able to find it

Solomon is lost in a world of ritual

SOLOMON
(almost to himself)
My son is a very good student He
walks five miles to the Sisters
school every morning to study English
He is going to be a doctor one day

The pain of self-injury is an attempt to inure himself to
the pain of loss He turns away to stare into the fire

Archer has to walk away

NEARBY - AN ABANDONED BUILDING

houses the paltry assortment of journalists Archer walks
past the guards with a wave of the finger They assume --
because he is white -- that he belongs there

MADDY is hunched over a portable typewriter typing with two
fingers Archer leans over her shoulder to read

ARCHER
in the ninety degree heat farmer
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees
against the chain-link fence--

Maddy whirls around Archer finishes the sentence

ARCHER (CONTD)
--rattling the wire with his powerful

hands”
MADDY
(defensive)
- What
ARCHER
Nothing
MADDY

You think Im exploiting his grief

Archer just looks at her She loses it

MADDY (CONTD)

You think I like being here Do you
have any idea what I could make back
in the states writing garbage about
movie stars--

(righteous fury)
All anybody sees here are victims
Not people With faces And lives
They deserve a voice

(shaking her head)
And the world deserves to know where
the things they buy come from And
how much they really cost

turns away)
So get out of my face and let me
work

Archer watches her work for a moment Rubs his eyes

ARCHER

Solomon thinks his son is going
to be a doctor one day

(she looks up)
Whats the life expectancy for infants
in a camp like this Whats going
to happen to a twelve year-old girl
That diamond is the only chance hes
got of getting his family out

MADDY
You expect me to believe you give a
rats ass about his family

ARCHER
No Im just exploiting his grief

She glares at him then looks away There are inherent
contradictions in both their intentions

ARCHER (CONTD)
I need to get to Kailahun The only
way now is with a UN convoy Ima
TV journalist and hes our cameraman

Maddys shaking her head She wont do it

MADDY
No

ARCHER
I sewed RUF diamonds into the
skins of goats I was smuggling
them across the border into Liberia

Maddy is taken by surprise Shes wary but ready to listen

ARCHER (CONTD)
The stones go to a middleman in
Monrovia

FLASH CUT - THE BACK ROOM OF A SEEDY SHOP 93
Fawaz spills a bag of rough diamonds onto the counter

ARCHER (V0O)

-who pays off a customs official
who certifies the diamonds were mined
in Liberiaso they can be
legitimately exported

FLASH CUT -- A CUSTOMS DESK 94

signed stamped and affixed to a WOODEN BOX NAILED SHUT

ARCHER (VO)
Once they reach London or the Antwerp

FLASH CUTS -- IN THE BOWELS OF THE DTC - LONDON 95

A SORTER discards the certificate of origin - spills the
DIAMONDS onto a SORTING TABLE mixes them with OTHER DIAMONDS

ARCHER (V0)
They become like any other diamond

FLASH CUT -- WIDER 96

There are many sorting tables each with PILES OF DIAMONDS
Electronic surveillance cameras observe it all

MADDY (VO0)
And De Wente knows about all this

ARCHER (V0)
Supply and demand Maddy Control
the supply and you keep demand high

FLASH CUT -- THE UN 97

DeWente and Simmons sit before the General Assembly piously
accepting the congratulations for their righteous stand

ARCHER
When African rebels flood the market
with a billion dollars worth of rough
De Wente cant afford to ignore it
Technically speaking hes not
promoting the war Hes just giving
them the means to do it

BACK IN THE ABANDONED BUILDING -- NIGHT 98

Maddys staring at Archer Hes giving her the biggest story
of her career

MADDY
Youll go on the record

Archer gives her a long look Nods yes

ARCHER
And if I come out with this stone
Danny Archer -- such as he is --

disappears from the face of the earth
INT PRESS BUS - MORNING 99

Someone is using strips of tape to write TV on the side of
the bus Aboard the bus a Spanish reporter speaks into a
digital recorder A CNN reporter chats with a French radio
type A BBC crew plays cards across the seats

Solomon stands outside the bus awkwardly holding a video-
camera a laminated PRESS ID around his neck

SOLOMON

ARCHER
Why not

SOLOMON

I am not a journalist

ARCHER
Of course youre not

SOLOMON
Then how can I say I am

ARCHER
Because you do because thats how

Archer and Solomon make their way down the aisle Archer
smiling to all like he belongs there Solomon massively
uncomfortable They nod to Maddy Solomon takes a seat
beside a Spanish reporter

SOLOMON

The UNICEF convoy winds its way through the Kanagari hills
Solomon stares out at the passing landscape

SOLOMON (VO)
Dia Yesterday I rode ina
helicopter Oh my God You would
not believe how big and beautiful is
this land of ours

A MUDDY JUNGLE TRAIL 101

A platoon of child soldiers trudges along singing a
revolutionary song The people will benefit from the riches
of their land RUF is the savior we need A nineteen
yearold leader prods Dia to sing louder

BACK TO THE BUS 102
where Solomon is talking quietly to Maddy

SOLOMON (V0O)
I have been living in the white
peoples world Computers video-
cameras and satellite phones You

AN RUF ENCAMPMENT 103

The child soldiers prepare for battle Under the watchful
eye of their older commanders some field-strip weapons and
paint their faces while others sniff amphetamines ‘Two
strong men hold Dias arm and inject him

SOLOMON (V0O)
I hope you are able to keep up with
your schoolwork You must study
hard if you truly hope to be a doctor

A FIREFIGHT IN THE JUNGLE 104

A platoon of RUF is ATTACKING a small hamlet Older
fighters walk behind the child soldiers threatening to shoot
them unless they advance

Dia fires his AK-47 indiscriminately He kills an ox and
then a man who tries to flee Tears stream down his face

SOLOMON (V0O)
Your mother and sisters are alive
Dia You must keep yourself alive
too Until I can find you And
bring you home

THE BUS COMES TO A SUDDEN CREAKING STOP 105

Everyone looks out the window Up ahead the road is blocked
by shouting VILLAGERS ECOMOG soldiers try to keep order

IRISH JOURNALIST
Whats going on

A RED CROSS TRUCK lies overturned on the road Charred A
hole in its side from the RPG that hit it

IRISH JOURNALIST (CONTD)
Christ Must have been an RPG

The word RPG has a special resonance for Archer Cameramen

rush to grab their gear Time to go to work

ARCHER
Wait No

The journalists push past him

ARCHER (CONTD)
The RUF is out there just waiting

for another target Its dangerous
MADDY
(gives him a look)
Duh

She pushes past him down the aisle

OUTSIDE THE BUS 106
Maddy and Solomon navigate the confusion of solders and
villagers Journalists speak into recorders “ these

people having come only to help have now become targets

A SOLDIER eyes Solomon suspiciously Why isnt he using the
camera Archer lifts it to Solomons eye and turns it on

THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER (VIDEO IMAGE)

Solomon PANS the tragic scene -- coming to rest on a MOTHER
begging for someone to help her wounded son

The sound of gunfire ECOMOG troops have seen something in
the tree-line and have begun exchanging fire

ARCHER
Hurry it up folks Unless you want
to end up the same way
Solomon cant move just stares at the boy and mother

ARCHER (CONTD)
Solomon--- lets go

Solomon puts down the camera and approaches the boy

ARCHER (CONTD)
What are you doing

Solomon picks up the boy and begins carrying him to the bus

ARCHER (CONTD)

LATER -- ARCHER SOLOMON AND MADDY 108

now ride in the Land Cruiser A loquacious COCKNEY JOURNALIST
is driving Ahead the bus belches black diesel

COCKNEY JOURNALIST
--Like the fookin M-4 Just what
this place needs bit of environmental
blight on top of the rest of it

From the passenger seat Archer looks back and sees Maddy
nodding off in the back her head resting against the window

COCKNEY JOURNALIST (CONTD)
--Diesel fumes toxic chemicals
pesticides maybe a nuclear reactor
or two to melt down
A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION AHEAD

The lead mini-bus has HIT A LAND MINE A fireball rises
into a chimney of black smoke

AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE FROM THE BUSH

RUF fighters are emerging from the treeline
JUST AHEAD

The bus is RAKED with fire IT SKIDS TO A STOP blocking
their way Rebels armed with Ak-47s close in

ARCHER
GET OFF THE ROAD

But the Cockney falls against Archer SHOT in the head The
car KEEPS MOVING as Archer tries to reach past the dead man
and grab the wheel Before he can gain control

THE LAND CRUISER CAREENS off the shoulder of the road
SMASHING into a tree

GUNFIRE shatters their windows as Solomon THROWS HIMSELF on
top of Maddy pushing her down to the floor of the vehicle

ARCHER manages to push the dead journalist out the door and
throw the Land Cruiser into reverse

RUF FIGHTERS -- who have been running toward the car --
are forced to scatter or else be run over

As Archer rams the shifter into first a REBEL runs up to

the car from behind his weapon held above his head preparing
to shoot down into the back seat Just as he FIRES the car
lurches forward and his bullets stitch the cargo hatch

THE LAND CRUISER

Swerves away taking off the front bumper of the lead truck
A rebel raises an RPG to his shoulder takes aim Fires

ARCHER swerves at the last moment The RPG passes by its
exhaust trail the only evidence of the near-miss

They crashe headlong into the brush Its a bone-Jjarring
ride jagged branches loom and penetrate the windows the
chassis groans as tires pound over roots and hidden boulders
BACK ON THE ROAD

Journalists are rousted at gunpoint toward an uncertain fate
EXT DIRT ROAD -- AN HOUR LATER -- AT DUSK

The Land Cruiser emerges from the bush Its a wreck The
wheels grind against the wells two tires are flat smashed
windshield bullet holes along its length

Archer stops and has to force the door open to get out He
peers under the bonnet Bullet holes Its hopeless

They have

ARCHER
Grab your things

no choice but to set off on foot

LATER - THE NIGHT SKY IS SPECTACULAR

As they trudge along under a bright canopy of stars One
might even think of diamonds Archer uses dead reckoning

They walk

Up ahead

ARCHER
The Southern Cross Long as we head
North well hit the main road

in silence for a moment

MADDY
What do you think happened to the
people on the bus

ARCHER
You really want to think about it

Solomon stares up at a particularly bright star

SOLOMON
Kya kwayera taarigq
MADDY
We call it Venus
SOLOMON
We say the moons wife
(pointing)

She follows him through the sky
Two days before the new moon she
comes out alone looking for him
The moon and his wife are never
separated for very long

He is thinking of Jassie Maddy is moved

AT FIRST LIGHT - A BURNT-OUT CHURCH

Looms out

of the jungle as they walk a narrow track

Pornographic GRAFFITI has been spraypainted on the church

and West

Side Niggaz HEADLESS BODIES hang from the trees

SUDDENLY - OUT OF THE JUNGLE

Come a scary-looking band of semi-primitive natives adorned
with colorful amulets shells and talismans They carry a
miscellany of handguns machetes and spears

SOLOMON
Be very still
(MORE)

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Do not look them in the eye
(to Archer)
They are Kamajor

The HEADSMAN gestures angrily at Archer Solomon lowers his

eyes and responds deferentially Archer whispers to Maddy
ARCHER
Local militia Protecting their
homes

The Headsman gestures with his machete Several of his men
prod Archer forward with an old double-barreled shotgun

113 LATER - THEY WALK A JUNGLE PATH

Archer looks around for any means of escape There is none

114 EXT MENDE VILLAGE -- DAY

They emerge from the bush to discover a cluster of buildings

untouched by the ravages of war Flowering gardens and neatly-

raked paths After all they have seen it seems dreamlike
A GROUP OF CHILDREN
Emerge from the building and race toward them

MENDE CHILDREN
Where are you from Have you come
from America Do you have CDs

A GENTLE VOICE calls out

GENTLE VOICE
Dont be bothering the people now
Let them come in

The children instantly obey BENJAMIN KAPANAY appears in
doorway He is a tall sixty-five year-old distinguished-
looking Mende with a trim white beard

BENJAMIN
(in Mende subtitles)
Thank you Ubani You can leave
them here I take responsibility

KAMAJOR HEADMAN
(in Mende subtitles)
Good Now they are your problem

The Kamajors back away vanishing into the forest
BENJAMIN

What should I make of your companions

Solomon doesnt know how to answer He lies badly

SOLOMON
(in Mende subtitles)
They are journalists
BENJAMIN

(in Mende subtitles)
Ah And I suppose you are too

Solomon looks away ashamed Benjamin turns to Maddy

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Might I interest you in a glass of

lemonade

BENJAMIN

MADDY
Excuse me
BENJAMIN

By way of James McGrath a young

Peace Corps volunteer from Winnetka --
who found a semi-literate Mende boy
and was foolish enough to believe he
could benefit from higher education

ARCHER

How long were you in the States
BENJAMIN

Which time I ended up getting my

Masters at Stanford -- better climate
MADDY

But you came back

BENJAMIN
To show my people the way Hah

They are served a platter of vegetables by a well-mannered
ten year-old boy Benjamins son UCHENNA

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Thank you Uchenna

SOLOMON
You built this school

BENJAMIN
Starting in 1967 Children from all
over the district find their way
here Over five hundred graduates

MADDY
Thats remarkable Would you mind

BENJAMIN
Ill make you a deal Miss Bowen --
I give you an interview and you teach
at my school for a month

MADDY
(laughs)
Id like that
BENJAMIN
But you wont do it
MADDY
No
BENJAMIN

An honest journalist how refeshing
The truth is I have done well to
keep a low profile This is a very
dangerous part of the country with
the diamond mines so close by

Solomon meanwhile hasnt been able to take his eyes off of
Benjamins young son The boy smiles back at him

SOLOMON
My son wants to be a doctor

BENJAMIN
Very good Where is he now

A silence

ARCHER
We dont know

BENJAMIN
I understand

A SERIES OF IMAGES 116

Benjamin gives them a tour a group of eight year-olds crowd
around a single computer a ten year-old girl is being taught
to use an artificial limb twelve year-old boys play cricket

BENJAMIN
Many of these children were taken by
the RUF We have taken them back
(looks at Solomon)
Some of them have been made to do
horrible things We are trying to
bring them back to life

Solomon turns away to hide the surge of emotion

LATER -- AT SUNSET 117

They sit drinking wine The African sunset is inimitable
BENJAMIN

-- it was all very clear in 1964
(MORE)

BENJAMIN (CONTD)

Political freedom plus economic
development equals happiness But
sometimes revolution leads to chaos
and economic opportunity doesnt
necessarily bring out the best in
people Certain personality types
realized freedom could be another
name for greed

(raises his glass)
And here we are

MADDY
But look what youve accomplished
BENJAMIN
And look what good it has done my
country
MADDY

There is no easy walk to freedom
We can only do the best we can

BENJAMIN
Mandela His best is a bit better
than mine

He takes a long look at his children

ARCHER
Had many attacks in the area

BENJAMIN
Ive known most of the young people
in this district since they were
born The local commander is still
afraid Ill come after him with my
ruler

ARCHER
You think because your intentions
are good theyll spare you

Benjamin takes the question in stride

BENJAMIN
My heart always told me that people
are inherently good My experience
suggests otherwise Which to believe

Benjamin turns his penetrating gaze on Archer

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
What about you Mr Archer In your
long career as ajournalist
Would you say people are mostly good

Archer stares back The SOUND of A CHILDRENS CHOIR
118 IN THE CENTER OF THE VILLAGE -- THAT NIGHT 118

The children are singing High We Exult Thee Realm of the
Free the national anthem of Sierra Leone Solomon and
Maddy sit with Benjamin and his family

Maddy sees Archer get up and walk away
119 AT THE EDGE OF THE COMPOUND 113

Archer stands alone He takes a long pull from a plastic
jug Maddy steps out from the shadows

ARCHER
Palm wine Sap comes right out of
the tree

He offers to her and she takes a swig Makes a face

ARCHER (CONTD)
You get used to it

He takes another long drink Hes pretty drunk

ARCHER (CONTD)
Drank this as a boy

MADDY
Rhodesia
(off his look)
I take notes

Indeed her little spiral notebook is already in hand He
looks at her -- considering -- then what the hell

ARCHER
I got sent to South Africa when the
muntz overran the farm in 76

MADDY
--After you lost your parents

ARCHER
(dark laugh)
Thats a polite way of putting it
Mum was raped Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn

MADDY
You were what ten years old

ARCHER
Nine Boo-hoo

MADDY
Then at eighteen you joined the
army
Archer peers at her
ARCHER

Want to hear about the first time I
banged a journalist

She just looks at him He takes another long drink Relents
ARCHER (CONTD)

Yah yah First they had us doing
dirty little jobs in the townships

MADDY
With the Security services
ARCHER
You think you know about the Security

services

(another dark laugh)
You dont know shite That was a
picnic compared to what we did on
the Moz border Sometimes I think
‘God will forgive us for what we
did Then I look around and I
wonderwhat would God want with a
place like this

He takes another drink but the jug is empty He tosses it

ARCHER (CONTD)
By 94 Im a ten years vet Then
poof No more apartheid no more
army Thanks very much see ya later
Truth and reconciliation Kumbaya

He raises his middle finger in a universal gesture

ARCHER (CONTD)

They told us we were fighting
Communism Protecting our ‘way of
life’

(a rueful laugh)
Its about who gets what Oil
Coltan Diamonds So one day I
decided fuck it now I want mine

MADDY
Are you going to steal his diamond

ARCHER
We have no chance in hell of getting
the diamond

MADDY
Doesnt answer the question

ARCHER
That diamond -- whether I steal it
or just take the commission -- is my

ticket out of here

MADDY
To go where

Archer hasnt gotten that far in his thinking
EXT HILL COUNTRY - NEXT MORNING (SEEN FROM ABOVE) 120

Benjamin drives them down roads that are little more than
animal tracks Bush pigs scamper Chimpanzees chatter above

Solomon looks up into the canopy of forest as the sun darts
in and out of view

SOLOMON (V0O)
Dear Dia I have found a place for
your studies once you return home

Benjamin shows Maddy the hippos splashing in the river

BENJAMIN
Do not be fooled by the movie where
they wear pink skirts and dance on
their toes They are extremely
dangerous easily angered and very
fast

Benjamins love of all that he sees is infectious As he
plays tour guide they forget for a moment their dire
circumstances and surrender to the joys of the natural world

SOLOMON (V0)
There is a man I want you to meet
He is a teacher You will like him

Benjamin turns a wry eye to Archer

BENJAMIN
What story will you be covering when
I drop you in Kailahun Mr Archer

ARCHER
Thank you for your help Mr Kapanay
I wont forget it

BENJAMIN
I hope the story will end the way
you want it to

UP AHEAD - A TEMPORARY ROADBLOCK 121

guarded by TWO TWELVE YEAR-OLD CHILD SOLDIERS

ARCHER
Keep going

BENJAMIN
What--

ARCHER

Drive right at them Theyll panic
Instead Benjamin slows the car

BENJAMIN
Do you know where the word ‘infantry
comes from It means child soldier
They are just children

THE TWO RUF SOLDIERS

are indeed children One wears a Michael Jordan jersey the
other has skateboard stickers on his Ingram submachine gun
But their eyes are glazed and deadened

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Hello little brothers What are
your names

CHILD SOLDIER 1
I am Dead Body Who dis mothafuckah

BENJAMIN
We are teachers on our way to
Kailahun

CHILD SOLDIER 2
Only RUF on da road

BENJAMIN
I understand but we have to--

CHILD SOLDIER 2
ONLY RUF

BENJAMIN
Now listen here I am--

The boy FIRES HIS WEAPON without warning Benjamin is hit
in the chest

ARCHER
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST

He leans over and STOMPS ON THE GAS PEDAL The car LURCHES
FORWARD knocking aside the other boy Archer has to
practically straddle the wounded man to speed away

IN THE CAR (TRAVELING) 122
Benjamin tries to speak Blood bubbles from his lips

ARCHER
Do NOT try to talk If youre not
dead its only because youre hit
in the lung not the heart

Solomon is leaning over the seat opening Benjamins shirt

ARCHER (CONTD)
(to Solomon)
Dont worry about the entry wound
Lean him forward theres going to
be a big hole in his back Press
your hand against it Keep it there
(to Maddy)
If theres any wine left in that
jug pour it all over everything
to Benjamin)
How far to Kailahun

BENJAMIN
(weakly)
Yousaidnot to talk

ARCHER
A fucking comedian

He pushes the old cars accelerator to its limit
IN THE CAR (TRAVELING) -- DUSK 123
Benjamin is slumped unconscious against the passenger door

ARCHER
Hows his pulse

MADDY
Its a pulse

ROUNDING A BEND 124

They are suddenly confronted by two ARMORED CARS and a platoon
of white mercenaries carrying Uzis The soldiers all wear
maroon berets with the initials E0o

MOMENTS LATER - TWO MEDICS ATTACH AN IV TO BENJAMIN 125

Archer and Solomon help place him on a litter He is
conscious again

ARCHER
Youll be all right
BENJAMIN
(looks him in the eye)

Will you
He is hurried away as--
AN ATTACK HELICOPTER TAKES OFF NEARBY
Raising a cloud of dust Joost appears out of the confusion

JOOsT
Archerwhat the fuck--

ARCHER
Good to see you too Joost

Maddy is furiously scribbling notes of all she sees

Joost
Were evacuating all non-military
personnel Relief workers
journalists
(to Archer)
Shite-bags

ARCHER
How fars the front line

JOOST
There is no front line Little
buggers are everywhere
(starts off)
Colonels this way

126 THE COLONELS HQ 126

A large tent The Colonel pores over a map while talking on
a SAT-phone Archer and Joost enter

THE COLONEL

(on the phone)
-but if we block their escape by
cutting the bridge--

(sees Archer)
Wait One

(covers the mouthpiece)
Archer Dont want to say I told
you so--

ARCHER
But you will

THE COLONEL
The Sierra Leone government has hired
us to recapture the diamond mines

ARCHER
In return for a mining concession or
two no doubt

THE COLONEL

(a modest nod)
Ive got a C-130 touching down at
1400 Everybody not prepared to get
dirty is on it

(checks his watch)
Youve got thirty minutes to make up
your mind Youre either with us or
out of here

He turns back to his conversation Archer is dismissed
127 EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE CAMP -- NIGHT 127
Maddy is waiting as Archer walks back

ARCHER
How is he

MADDY
They say hell live

ARCHER
Youre on a plane for Ghana in half
an hour
(looks at her)
Do me one last favor

Maddy just looks at him Archer indicates a young MERCENARY
standing guard in front of a large supply tent

ARCHER (CONTD)
Go tell that guard you want to put
his face on the cover of Soldier of
Fortune magazine

MADDY

Youre going in
(Archer nods)

You and Solomon

Archer nods again She shakes her head

MADDY (CONTD)
Now
(another nod)
Youre an idiot

ARCHER
Help me or not

Maddy shakes her head sadly She turns away pushing the
hair out of her face as she approaches the YOUNG MERCENARY

MADDY
Hi there Maddy Bowen Vanity Fair
You mind if I ask you a few questions

YOUNG MERCENARY
Depends what they are--

MADDY
Oh so youre familiar with our
devious ways are you

She flashes a devastating smile And while his back is
turned we SEE Archer edge past toward the back of the tent

128 INSIDE THE SUPPLY TENT 128

Archer forages for whatever he can lay his hands on Into
his pack he stuffs K-rations a GPS first-aid kit

He desperately looks for one more thing And there it is
A SAT-phone He stuffs it in Outside the SOUND of a plane

129 EXT AIRSTRIP -- MOMENTS LATER 129
A giant C-130 Hercules touches down
THE SWARM OF JOURNALISTS
Aid workers and refugees surge onto the tarmac Carrying
her bag Maddy moves against the tide looking around

Solomon appears beside her subtly taking her arm

SOLOMON
This way

ARCHER is waiting behind a tent the pack already on his
shoulders She turns to Solomon

MADDY
Good luck to you Solomon Bo

Solomon takes her hand in both of his

SOLOMON

Thank you for all youve done
MADDY

I hope you find what youre looking

for

She turns to Archer They look at each other

ARCHER
Yeah Thanks

MADDY
--Just keeping my end of the deal

A moment of silence She can be as tough as he can

ARCHER
Listen--

MADDY
No you listen--

And they just stare at each other

ARCHER
In another life maybe

MADDY
Sure Okay

ARCHER
Find yourself a good man Maddy
You deserve to be happy

She considers him -- wishing she were less affected by him

MADDY

I have three sisters All married
to “good men” Long as their
prescriptions are filled theyre
happy No thanks I prefer my life

(hands him her card)
Office phone home phone cell phone
Im used to being pursued but what
the hell

He smiles

MADDY (CONTD)
Its a world phone by the way

ARCHER
You should get on the plane

MADDY
So should you

He smiles and turns away

MADDY (CONTD)
Are you going to call me

ARCHER
Soon aS Im near a phone

MADDY
Yeah right

She turns toward the plane They head the opposite way

IN THE BUSH 130
Archer and Solomon begin to jog

BACK AT THE AIRSTRIP 131
Maddy is about to board the plane when Joost waylays her

JOOST
Where is he

MADDY
Where is who

She continues up the steps to the plane Joost looks around
No sign of Archer The wheels begin to turn in his head

ARCHER AND SOLOMON TREK 132

into the bush They move quickly putting distance between
themselves and the EOcamp As they run THE CAMERA rises
up higher and higher until their tiny figures have

disappeared and the FRAME IS FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT GREEN

We sense of the immensity of the challenge that lies ahead
EXT THE BUSH -- LATER 133

Archer and Solomon have stopped to catch their breath Archer
digs out the SAT-phone fires it up and punches in a number

ARCHER
(on the phone)
-Fawaz 1 know No time now
Thats rightTwo days to get in
one to get out I11 call when were
headed for the strip Right ‘Bye

He looks up to see if Solomon has been listening But Solomon
is staring off into the jungle

SOLOMON (V0)
Dear Dia I am coming With every
step I am closer I can feel you
are nearby I am coming soon

EXT A JUNGLE TRAIL -- ELSEWHERE 134
A column of RUF guerrillas walk a jungle trail We can

SEE by the gouges of earth that they are in diamond country
Dia looking much older carries an AK-47

“78

BACK TO ARCHER AND SOLOMON 135

as he stuffs the SAT-phone into his back He sets off without
a word knowing Solomon will follow

THEY TRAVEL BY NIGHT 136
On narrow dirt roads lit only by the moon
HEADLIGHTS APPROACH 137

Archer and Solomon take cover as TRUCKS pass filled with
RUF teenagers laughing smoking ganja music blasting

Solomon studies each passing face Almost involuntarily he
rises to his feet trying to get a better look Suddenly
he thinks he sees a familiar face could it be Dia He
moves closer - but the truck is moving away

SOLOMON
Dia

Heads turn in the passing truck Its not Dia

Suddenly Solomon is grabbed from behind and thrown to the
ground Archer looms over him

ARCHER
What the fuck are you doing

SOLOMON
GET OFF ME

Meanwhile on the road the trucks have slowed Suddenly--
THE BRUSH EXPLODES WITH GUNFIRE

Red and Green TRACERS shred the dense foliage around them
Bullets WHIZ by their heads RICOCHET off ancient trees

They scramble to their feet and race blindly back into the
bush Behind them the SOUND of their pursuers

Soon the brush grows more dense In the pitch darkness they
are literally fighting their way forward flailing with both
arms to rip holes through the thick foliage Their hands
and faces are soon cut and bleeding

THEY RUN 138
Until they can run no further Archer stumbles and falls
Solomon crumples to the ground beside him As they lie there
winded they HEAR VOICES

They can see the GLOW OF CIGARETTES through the foliage only
a few yards away as RUF soldiers approach

79

ON SOLOMON AND ARCHER

as the soldiers boots pass within inches of their hiding
place They bury their faces deeper in the mud

DAYBREAK
finds them still hiding Cautiously they emerge -- stiff
wet and miserable from a night spent on the jungle floor
ARCHER
(furious)

Next time you pull something like
that I will shoot you myself

SOLOMON
(equally furious)
Shoot me now It is what you are
planning anyway

ARCHER
What are you talking about

SOLOMON
You think I do not know the kind of
man you are You buy diamonds from
the same people who took my son

ARCHER
--Maddy told you

SOLOMON
Is this true

Archer looks at him

ARCHER
Yes It is true
SOLOMON
And all you have said How the

diamond will free my family This
too is a lie Is it not

ARCHER
I dont know Maybe
(looks at him)
But Im not the only one who tells
lies am I

SOLOMON
I do not lie

ARCHER
No You dont give a fuck about
finding the diamond

(MORE)

ARCHER (CONTD)
Youre out here looking for your
son And youd cut my heart out in
a second if it means a chance to get
him back

Solomon is shocked into silence Archer is right

SOLOMON
Yes It is true

The two men stare at each other

ARCHER
Long as we understand each other

He sets off into the brush limping heavily

SOLOMON
You are hurt

ARCHER
(without looking back)
Im fine

Solomon reaches to take the heavy pack from Archers shoulder
Archer grabs his hand They lock eyes for a moment

SOLOMON
You think Im going to steal it

Archer turns and walks away Solomon looks down to see BRIGHT
DROPS OF BLOOD from Archers boot staining the ground

140 LATER - THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND OF APPROACHING HELICOPTERS 140

forces them to take cover Two EO gunships streak past
Are the choppers looking for them or is it a coincidence

141 LATER THAT DAY - THE SUN HAS REACHED ITS ZENITH 141
as they trudge onward Archers limp is more pronounced
He tips back his canteen and finds it empty Solomon notices
He passes his canteen to Archer who hesitates for a moment
then laughs and puts his mouth to a black mans canteen
142 LATER THEY TRAVERSE A HIGH RIDGE 142

In the distance we see the receding peaks Archer begins a
conversation as much out of boredom as anything else

ARCHER
So youre a farmer

Solomon looks at him warily Nods

ARCHER (CONTD)
What do you grow

SOLOMON

ARCHER
I grew up on a farn
(remembering)
Hated every minute of it
End of conversation They walk on in silence
STILL LATER - DEEP PITS IN THE EARTH 143

Begin to appear as Archer and Solomon climb through a hilly
landscape Solomon stares at the diamond mines

SOLOMON
It is like they are eating the earth

He walks on Archer labors to keep up with Solomons pace
ABANDONED HOUSES 144
caved-in and listing line a street where deep pits have

been dug beneath their foundations Impoverished SQUATTERS
follow them with listless hungry eyes as they pass

Archer is jittery to be observed But in Africa people are
everywhere Blood squishes in his boot as he walks

BY SUNSET 145
They have been walking for twelve hours Archer has to sit

ARCHER
How much farther--

SOLOMON
One day more

He kneels before Archer

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Let me see your leg

ARCHER
Its fine

Solomon touches it and Archer GRUNTS in pain
ARCHER (CONTD)
Its infected From lying there all
fucking night

Solomon lifts Archers pant leg Examines it

SOLOMON
Give me your knife

ARCHER
In the other boot

Solomon takes the K-Bar Archer grits his teeth We cannot
see what Solomon does -- but from the expression on Archers
face we can only imagine

Solomon stands Archer tries to but the pain is overwhelming

SOLOMON
I will be back

Archer pulls his Sig-Sauer 9mm from his belt

ARCHER
No--

Solomon starts walking away COCKS the weapon

ARCHER (CONTD)
You think I wont shoot you

SOLOMON
Shoot me then And try to find the
diamond yourself
(keeps walking)
I will be back
LATER THAT NIGHT A SMALL VILLAGE

has been taken over by CHILD SOLDIERS They sit throwing
bullets into a barrel fire and LAUGHING as they explode

Solomon creeps to the edge of a hut -- peering at the faces
No Dia

Six more teenagers are loading the spoils of the village
onto a truck One of them could be Dia He isnt

HOURS LATER - THE MOON HAS RISEN

Archer awakens to see Solomon walking toward him out of the
bush He carries a poultice made of leaves and mud

He kneels and begins to apply it to Archers wound
SOLOMON
I thought about not coming back
(looks at him)
I talked to my son about it

Archer looks at him What the hell is he talking about

SOLOMON (CONTD)
I talk to him all the time
(works on the leg)
He says I must forgive what you have
done in the past And trust that
you will help get my family back

‘Archer doesnt know how to respond to this simple absolution

ARCHER
Youre fucking crazy

Solomon finishes wrapping the poultice

SOLOMON
I will go and find us water

He stands again and walks away

Archer cant bear feeling powerless Fighting the pain he
stands and tries to walk Its excruciating still he
continues hobbling -- until finally he sits on the ground

CAPE TOWN AIRPORT TERMINAL -- NIGHT 148

Maddy de-planes with a contingent of journalists Like
everyone else who gets off a plane these days she turns on
her cell phone to check for messages There are none

Archer hasnt called
DAWN IN THE JUNGLE 149

is soft and full of promise Low clouds hang just above the
treetops as first light touches the moist greenery

Archers face is at peace as he wakes Solomon sleeps nearby

Archer reaches to scratch his nose and realizes he is covered
with BLACK ANTS Scrambling to his knees he frantically
brushes them off They are in his ears inside his shirt
Solomon awakens and begins to laugh at Archers frenzy

ARCHER
I HATE FUCKING ANTS

SOLOMON
I think you are feeling better

And then Solomon realizes that he too is infested He
reaches into his pants and begins to hop around Now its
Archers turn to laugh

Soon they are both sitting on the ground LAUGHING for no
reason -- except of course as a release from all that has
befallen them

THE ENDLESS HILLS

glow pink in the dawn as they walk A herd of antelope burst
from the brush and bound majestically away

SOLOMON
--You are how old

ARCHER
Me Thirty One

SOLOMON
And you have no wife

ARCHER
No

SOLOMON
No children

ARCHER
No

Solomon shakes his head After a moment Archer cant resist

ARCHER (CONTD)

--What

SOLOMON
Truly I do not understand white
people

ARCHER

That makes two of us
AS THEY CREST A HILL

Solomon suddenly stops He looks around Then he falls to
his knees Archer climbs to where he is and looks around--

A MASS GRAVE

has been fashioned from an abandoned diamond pit BODIES
piled high -- men women children None ef them soldiers

ARCHER (CONTD)
Animals

SOLOMON
No animal would ever do such a thing
It makes no sense

Solomon forces himself to walk among the corpses praying
that his son is not among them Tears stream down his cheeks

SOLOMON (CONTD)
My people value life The Mende
find it hard even to take the life
of a chicken God gives life only
he may take it back
a strangled cry)
How can they do this

Archer has no answer Just looks at him
SOLOMON (CONTD)
(numbly)
Why is there so much evil here
What is wrong with us
151 HOURS LATER
Archer uses a tree branch as a cane
ARCHER
(feeling his forehead)
Ive stopped sweating Weve got to
find water

SOLOMON
Then we must move faster

Archer nods and pushes himself past the pain in his leg
152 HOURS LATER - THE SUN IS SCORCHING AT MID-DAY

Archer stumbles Solomon offers a hand to lift him to his
feet Archer ignores it Ahead is a CLEARING and in it

A BULL ELEPHANT

stands tall and menacing Beside him on the ground is his
mate -- grievously wounded and BELLOWING piteously

For a moment Archer and Solomon are too stunned to speak

ARCHER
Back away And watch where you step

Solomon freezes

SOLOMON
Is it--

ARCHER
A minefield Yes

They stare at the MAGNIFICENT CREATURE who refuses to leave
his fallen mate Slowly they retrace their steps

No sooner have they turned their backs than AN EXPLOSION
shakes the ground and A FLOCK OF BIRDS rises over the field

They know what it means Grimly they keep moving
THE JUNGLE AT NIGHT 153

is a freaky place at the best of times with strange shapes
shadows and noises everywhere In their state it feels
like a bad acid trip Solomon hears the WHISPERED VOICE of
his son He carries on an imagined conversation

SOLOMON
--Why The cows will do fine in
the upper pasture

ARCHER
Hey

SOLOMON
(in a kind of trance)
-- Yes And next year we will plant
coffee--

ARCHER
HEY
(Solomon is startled)
Youre hallucinating

SOLOMON
No I am not

HOURS LATER - ARCHER 154

Archer is half-asleep as they trudge through deep jungle
He stops suddenly A SNAKE hangs menacingly from a tree

ARCHER
Do you see that

SOLOMON
What

ARCHER
The snake

SOLOMON
No

ARCHER
Good

Archer now sees that it is only a tree branch
THEY WALK ON FOR A MOMENT

This time it is Solomon who stops short

SOLOMON
Wait
(listening)
Can you hear it

Archer listens hard A weird croaking sound Frogs

ARCHER
Frogs

SOLOMON
YES

Frogs mean water They stumble forward to discover--
A SMALL STREAM BED
They fling themselves onto their bellies and begin to drink

ARCHER
What ifthis wateris bad

SOLOMON
You can wait for beer

Good point Archer drinks his fill
155 THE NEXT MORNING 155
Finds them sitting by the stream Archer studies his map
ARCHER
This must be the Meli It runs from
the North The Moa runs from the
East Where the rivers meet is where
the mine is right

Solomon says nothing

ARCHER (CONTD)
Right

Solomon just glares at him

ARCHER (CONTD)
You get that diamond you can hire a
team of people to find him You can
buy the whole damn government
(leaning in)
What are you gonna do spend the
rest of your life searching the bush

Solomon looks at him Yes If necessary
156 HOURS LATER - THEY FOLLOW THE STREAM 156

now grown into a broad river

HOURS LATER - THEY CLIMB A STEEP RAVINE 157
Archer is struggling Once again Solomon offers a hand to
help him over a boulder This time Archer grudgingly accepts
the hand The moment is underplayed but deeply significant

Cresting a hill Solomon looks down on the confluence of the
two rivers A familiar gorge

SOLOMONS POV - THE DIAMOND MINING CAMP

is spread out below HOLES and PITS pock the landscape
Archer joins him at the overlook

ARCHER
Thats it isnt it

Solomons face is clouded with memory Its a place from his
nightmares A place he hoped never to see again

A LARGE CONTINGENT OF RUF TROOPS

is encamped near the mines Archer can see dozens of tiny
fires with troops huddled beside them

ARCHER (CONTD)

Christ
He kneels -- trying to figure out their next move
ARCHER (CONTD)
Okay

He digs into his pack for the SAT-phone

ARCHER (CONTD)
The EO would want to know about a
force this size If I call Joost
hell send in an air strike
(the plan unfolds)
We use it as a diversion

Below them TEENAGE REBELS play soccer in a ragged field
Is Dia among them It is too far away to know

SOLOMON
No air strike

ARCHER
How do we get in there without some
kind of diversion

SOLOMON
Noairstrike

ARCHER
He isnt down there

SOLOMON
How do you know

ARCHER
(coldly)
Im calling it in
(turns on SAT-phone)
They’11 come in at first light
Low Over that ridge Thats how
Much time youve got

Solomon turns and starts down the hill

ARCHER (CONTD)
Hold up there boy--

Solomon reacts to Archers instinctive use of boy

ARCHER (CONTD)
Im not letting you get yourself
killed until I have that fucking
stone We wait for dark

A LIST OF CALL NUMBERS is taped to the inside of the SAT-
phones case Archer punches in a number

ARCHER (CONTD)
(on the SAT-phone)
Get me Joost ArcherHell
know-- Ask if hes interested in the
location of a major RUF camp

LATER -- THE DIAMOND CAMP -- NIGHT 158

is just as we remember it Muddy and exhausted SLAVE WORKERS
try to keep out of A DRIVING RAIN squatting under corrugated
tin roofs while eating their tiny portion of rice gruel

Rebel soldiers -- adults and teenagers alike -- eat Red Cross
rations while trying to keep warm and dry

ARCHER AND SOLOMON
have crawled forward to the edge of the camp

ARCHER

I cant walk in there You stay in
my line of sight and Ill cover you
If hes not there we move around
the perimeter The air strike happens
at 0600

(racks the slide of

his Sig-Sauer)
You do exactly as I say And dont
mistake me for your friend You
fuck with me and Ill surely kill
you

A SENTRY
huddles miserably in the rain
Archer SPRINGS out of the shadows and choke-holds him --
then drags him back into the bushes where Solomon is hiding

Archer takes his weapon - an HandK assault rifle

Solomon stands up and walks into the camp as inconspicuously
as possible Archer watches under cover of the brush as

SOLOMON

insinuates himself among the miserable workers moving from
hut to hut -- trying to see if Dia is among them

He isnt Solomon moves deeper into the village
ARCHER

curses aS Solomon walks out of his line of sight
IN THE CAMP

Solomon is about to give up hope when--

HE SEES DIA Solomon blinks back his disbelief

Dias with TWO OLDER REBELS who are watching him take a hit
from a big spliff laughing as he chokes on the smoke

Solomon tries to will Dia to turn in his direction

ARCHER

Scuttles through the bush -- trying to get a line of sight
EXT TWO SENTRIES

appear nearby -- carrying food for the sentry Archer has
killed Unable to find him they begin to CALL out for him

IN THE CAMP

Dia and the other soldiers separate Solomon moves out from
the shadows

SOLOMON
(whispering)
Dia--
Dia turns -- uncomprehending

Solomon takes his arm

DIA
(suddenly fearful)
NO

SOLOMON
Dia its me
Three months of horror of depravation of trauma of
unspeakable acts have taken root in the soul of this young
boy His face contorts in struggle Then--

DIA
GET AWAY FROM ME GET AWAY
(screaming)
FARMER TRAITOR

He tries to break free of Solomons grasp A few other
soldiers HEAR him cry out They turn to look

ARCHER 164

hears it as well He steps from his hiding place -- trying
to see what is happening

AN RUF SOLDIER 165

sees Solomon holding Dia by the arm He HITS HIM IN THE
BACK with his rifle butt Solomon crumples to the ground

ARCHER 166
aims the assault rifle but the GUARDS have picked up Solomon
and -- at sixty yards at night in the driving rain --

theres no way Archer can get off a clean shot Then--

The SOUND of a SLIDE being racked The barrel of an AK-47
is placed against Archers head

EXT THE REBEL CAMP -- NEXT MORNING 167

Solomons arms have been TIED behind his back -- the rope
looped over a tree branch and re-tied He looks up to see--

DIA standing with several guards His face is hard and
withdrawn He turns away from Solomons gaze

A SHOVEL is thrown at Solomons feet

VOICE
I knew you would come back

Solomon looks up into the disfigured face of CAPTAIN POISON
A brutal scar only adds to the malice in his eyes

Poison motions to the dozens of HOLES that pock the landscape --
giant scars of diamond fields that have been mined out

POISON
See how I have dug I have found
nothing
(to Solomon)
You will dig again for me You will
dig up what you have come back for

SOLOMON
No

POISON
No Do you think the white man will
rescue you

He turns Solomons head violently to the left where
ARCHER

Has been made to kneel arms tied behind his back head to
the ground with a gun held to the back of his skull

POISON (CONTD)
This white man is the cause of your
suffering This white man his
masters abroad -- and his black
puppets in the government

Poison whips out a dog-eared manifesto from his army jacket
POISON (CONTD)
Foday Sankoh say -- resist and

overthrow those who would exploit
you Shed their blood

He slaps Solomons head with the book
POISON (CONTD)
Maybe some more digging will help
you learn this lesson

The rope holding Solomon is cut He falls to the ground and
is prodded to his feet by several SOLDIERS holding Ak-47s

Solomon looks down at the shovel But doesnt move
Surreptitiously Archer glances at his watch It is 559

POISON (CONTD)
Pick it up

SOLOMON
Why You are going to kill me anyway

With a sigh Poison whispers in Solomons ear

POISON
I do not need to kill you Solomon
Vandy Because now you have a name
And a family If you do not give me
this diamond I will find this family --
just as I have found your son

He goes to Dia and puts his arm around him

POISON (CONTD)
I will rape your wife in front of
you then slit her throat
(smiles)
And I will keep your daughters for
myself

It is the first time we have seen the light go out of
Solomons eyes -- in part because of Poisons words but
mostly because of Dias look of indifference
POISON (CONTD)
You think I am a devil But only
because I have lived in hell I
want to get out You will help me

Curiously enough these words could have been Archers when
first we met him He watches as

Solomon takes the shovel All his hopes and dreams end here
He is must dig the earth one last time to save his family

He looks out at the jungle Nothing looks familiar -- the
trees SWIRLINGmaking him dizzy

SOLOMON
I dont remember

Archer head to the ground watches Solomon closely Sneaks
another peek at his watch 0600 hours No air strike

POISON
Find it Or your family will die

As if sleep-walking Solomon begins to walk toward the pits
Poison and several armed rebels follow close behind

THE FIRST ROCKET EXPLODES 168

in the middle of the camp -- sending a corrugated hut sky
high Everyone is knocked to the ground

An E0O HELICOPTER GUNSHIP streaks by overhead THE SECOND
ROCKET hits a truck -- instantly turning it into a fireball

THE GUNSHIPS GATLING GUNS

fire 800 ROUNDS PER SECOND chew up everything in its path

ARCHERS GUARD

is almost cut in half by the devastating firepower Archer
rolls behind a tree -- CHUNKS FLY from its base

SOLOMON CAPTAIN POISON AND AN RUF GUARD

have been knocked into a muddy DIAMOND PIT Solomon hugs
the ground as the jet SCREAMS over -- stitching the ground

ARCHER gets to his feet and sprints toward Dia -- ignoring
the EXPLOSIONS all around him Since his hands are still
tied behind his back --he hurtles a BODYCHECK into the back
of the SOLDIER guarding the boy

He THROWS HIMSELF on top of the boy -- as the gunships make
another pass -- KILLING RUF soldiers who try to escape

EXT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DIAMOND PIT 169

Solomon turns over the body of a dead guard and finds A
MACHETE in his belt Captain Poison looks up from the muck
and reaches for his 9mm -- only it isnt in his holster
Frantically he digs in the mud Its nowhere to be found

Solomon meanwhile gets to his feet and moves toward Poison --
who frantically tries to climb out of the pit --

The sides are high and slick The closer Solomon gets the
more frantically Poison tries to claw his way out But the
walls are just too slippery

He FALLS back -- sliding down -- at last finding his gun
He raises it but its too late -- Solomon RAISES THE MACHETE

All we can see is the lip of the pit but we can HEAR Poisons
SCREAMS as Solomons powerful arm RISES and FALLS

Solomons face is contorted -- as the rage that has been

buried for so long finds its expression He brings the

machete down again - and again with all his might Blood
spattering him Until he stops

With disbelief and horror at what hes done

TWO ARMORED VEHICLES 170

appear with 50 caliber machine guns FIRING from their mounts
Behind them MERCENARIES wearing the red beret of the EO

Joost organizes blocking positions around the perimeter of
the village -- cutting down anyone who tries to escape

It is all over in a matter of minutes

171 A SILENCE 171

As the SMOKE and DUST clears hardly a soul is moving THE
COLONEL strides into camp followed by TWO BODYGUARDS

ARCHER squints into the sun as the Colonel looms above him

THE COLONEL
Thank you for calling in the location

ARCHER
Youre welcome

THE COLONEL
Then again you had an ulterior
motive

SOLOMON emerges from the pit covered in blood He isa
terrifying sight -- this gentle man transformed into some
kind of monster

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
This must be the famous Mr Vandy
(to Archer)
Introduce us

ARCHER
This is Colonel Coetsee He wants
the diamond

THE COLONEL
No more than you

Archer nods True enough

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
(calls out)
Joost

Joost appears holding a 9mm to Dias head Dia is shocked
by his fathers appearance

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
(calls out)
Lt Gans

A mercenary LIEUTENANT appears

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
You will organize the withdrawal
We move out in thirty minutes
(turns to Solomon)
Lets take a walk shall we

The Colonels two bodyguards follow

MOMENTS LATER - ARCHER AND SOLOMON 172

are led at gunpoint into the diamond fields by the Colonels
BODYGUARDS The Colonel and Joost follow behind with Dia

JOOST
How much farther

Solomon doesnt answer They pass one pit after another

A SAT-phone RINGS in the pack carried by one of the Colonels
bodyguards The guard answers it and hands it to The Colonel

THE COLONEL
(on the SAT-phone)

eee eee NoNo transport for

prisoners Shoot them thats

what they pay us for
He hands the phone back to the bodyguard
HALF A MILE ON - IN A GROVE BY THE RIVERSIDE 173
Solomon stops The others react expectant

Looming out of the thick growth is THE RUBBER TREE Vines
have covered its base but its definitely the same tree

Solomon measures the distance Takes another few steps

He is about to raise the shovel Then stops dead the muscles
of his arm tensing Inches from his foot unmistakable --

is the TRIGGER of a land mine -- partially covered by vines

Solomon glances back to Joost who stands several yards away
He doesnt see it

Solomon looks back at the trigger -- an idea forming He
turns in Archers direction

SOLOMON
(looking around)
An elephant graveyard

JOOST
What Keep digging

Archer knows Solomon is trying him something -- in code

Solomon carefully takes a step sideways Sinks the shovel
into the earth Swallows Hes still in one piece

He sinks the shovel in again And again Digging

The Colonel watches intently

Solomon throws the shovel aside Gets down on his knees
digging with his hands now Faster Scooping out dirt and
rocks and sand Until there is nothing left to scrape out
He stares into the empty hole confounded

He looks to Joost then Archer then back into the hole
Grabs the shovel again starts digging the hole larger wider

SOLOMON
It is not here it is not here

THE COLONEL
What do you mean

SOLOMON
This is where I buried the stone
In this place But it is not here

beside himself)

Someone has taken it Come see for
yourself

The Colonel motions Joost over to Solomon Joost leaves Dia
by the Colonels side

As the mercenary ventures over --

Solomon glances at Archer his eyes convey something Archer
reads the look Out of the corner of his eye he sees

The TRIGGER It lies between Solomons hole and Joost

Solomon tries desperately not to look at the trigger as Joost
comes closer Closer

Joosts boot HITS the TRIGGER CLICK A millisecond of
realization on the stunned mercenarys face before--

THE EXPLOSION blows him to bits

Solomon is already DIVING behind a tree stump as--

Dia is thrown to the ground

Archer seizes the moment -- sending an OPEN-HAND STRIKE to
the throat of his would-be executioner then grabbing the AK-
47 and shooting him before ripping the gun out of his hands

ARCHER
STAY DOWN

SOLOMON remains flattened behind the tree stump head down

Archer sprays GUNFIRE at the mercenaries -- hitting the
Colonel and the guards He expends the entire clip

And no one is left standing

He looks back at the rebel camp -- knowing that other
mercenaries have heard the GUNFIRE

ARCHER (CONTD)
Lets go

Solomon gets up orients himself and begins to count steps
Spears the shovel into the earth Digs

ARCHER (CONTD)
(admiringly)
You lying bastard
Solomon throws the shovel down

THERE IN THE HOLE -- peeking out of the dirt -- is the torn
green cuff of a pantleg Solomon digs it out with his hands

FAR OFF VOICES

can be heard -- coming their way Armed EO mercenaries

Archer rams a fresh clip into the machine gun and reaches

into the dead bodyguards pack for his SAT-phone But as he
looks up he sees --

DIA

holding The Colonels 9mm Aimed at him

SOLOMON
Dia--

Dias eyes flicker from Archer to Solomon and then back

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Dia look at me

Dia looks into Solomons eyes

SOLOMON (CONTD)

(in Mende)
You are Dia Vandy Of the proud Mende
Your mother loves you - and she

waits by the fire making plaintains
and red palm stew with your sister
Nyanda and the new baby
moves closer)
The cows wait for you And Babu the
wild dog who minds no one but you
(moves closer still)
And I am your father who loves you
And you will go home with me and be
my son

He walks right up to him ignoring the gun and wraps his
arms around him

Dia goes limp the gun hangs loosely at his side -- as he
allows himself to be held

BEHIND THEM THE JUNGLE ERUPTS WITH GUNFIRE

Solomon throws Dia to the ground Archer takes cover

FOUR MERCENARIES ARE ADVANCING

across the river -- firing as they come

Archer RETURNS FIRE hitting two The others hit the ground

ARCHER
MOVE MOVE MOVE

He SHOVES Solomon and Dia to their feet
ANOTHER SPRAY OF GUNFIRE pins them down
ARCHER (CONTD)
When I start firing You run
stands up)
NOW

He lays down COVERING FIRE -- as Solomon and Dia head for
the brush Archer waits until they are safe then--

Its his turn to make a run He takes off
Its only thirty yards or so but they seem an eternity
He is almost into the brush when---

He is HIT in the back He grunts and doubles over

ARCHER (CONTD)
Fuck

He fights the shock and the pain -- adrenaline kicking in --
and stumbles into the dense cover

UP AHEAD - IN THE BUSH

He finds Solomon waiting Solomon has no notion that Archer
has been wounded

SOLOMON
How far

ARCHER
through gritted teeth)
Theresa stripon a ridge
fifteen kilometerssouth Fawaz
will meet us GO

They take off in that direction

IN THE JUNGLE MINUTES LATER 175
An eerie quiet broken only by the calls of exotic birds

Archer leads them -- paying for every step The entry wound
in his back is small almost unnoticeable

He stops and pulls out the SaAT-phone Dials
ARCHER

(on the SAT-phone)
tee eee Where are you Were twelve

clicks out Two hours at most
FAWAZ (0S)
--You have it
ARCHER
(on the SAT-phone)
Roger that
FAWAZ (0S)

Carrying a lot of fuel Dont know
if I can handle three more onboard

Archer looks up ahead to where Solomon and Dia are waiting
ARCHER
on the SAT-phone)
Ill get it sorted
He punches the button and starts off again
THREE KILOMETERS LATER 176

Solomon is STARING at the bloody exit wound below Archers
arm pit -- the stain spreading

Archer sees him see it Looks at him

SOLOMON
You must sit

ARCHER
Yeah lets just have tea

He starts moving again
THREE KILOMETERS LATER 177

Archer has to stop His breathing is labored He wipes his
mouth Looks at his hand No blood

ARCHER
Missedthe lungbut its
stillcollapsed Could
beworseI guess

SOLOMON
Rest now They will not find us

Archer looks around As if sensing their pursuit
ARCHER
Theyre good
(struggles to his
feet)
Lets go
He wills himself onward
THREE MORE KILOMETERS 178

have taken their toll Archer is stumbling now Solomon
says something to Dia in Mende

SOLOMON
We will carry you

ARCHER
No

SOLOMON
Yes

They each take one of Archers arms over their shoulders
Yoked together they struggle on

TWO KILOMETERS MORE 179

And they have reached the base of a rocky ridge Archer
takes out the binoculars and sees--

BINOCULAR POV -- OFF IN THE DISTANCE

TWO EO ARMORED VEHICLES churn up dust as they approach
Behind them come a squad of infantry on foot

IN THE SKY ABOVE
The Cessna appears circling
THE RIDGE ABOVE THEM IS VERY STEEP

with dense brush blocking their way In order to make it to
the landing strip they will have to climb it

It would be difficult enough to climb on ones own but to

carry another man -- as Solomon tries as he hoists Archer
over his shoulder -- is beyond imagining
ARCHER

ee Walt

SOLOMON
No--

One step Another step And then another

Solomons strength is tremendous They make progress Hand
over hand Rock by rock

Solomons face contorts with the effort His legs tremble
but still he keeps going The top of the ravine appears
far away but tantalizingly in sight

For a moment we might even believe they will make it -- but
then Solomon loses his footing He stumbles

Archer is slammed to the ground grunting in pain Solomon
reaches to pick him up again

ARCHER
STOP DAMNT

Archers shirt-front is SOAKED in BLOOD He is pale and
gasping for breath Solomon goes to pick him up again

ARCHER (CONTD)
No Let mesee it

SOLOMON
Mr Archer-
ARCHER
Youwant it allfor yourself

Solomon shakes his head smiles ruefully This is the moment
he realizes Archer is not going to make it

He hands Archer the wrapped stone Archer peels it open

Even wrapped in a dirty cloth it takes the breath away -
like something from the Gods

ARCHER (CONTD)
Its real

He holds it up to the warm afternoon light

ARCHER (CONTD)
Sobeautiful

Archer looks up to see Solomon staring at him He wraps it
back in the cloth

ARCHER (CONTD)
Take it

SOLOMON
I thought you would steal it from
me

ARCHER

It occurred to me
Solomon smiles

SOLOMON
To me as well

180 UP ABOVE 180
The plane touches down

181 DOWN BELOW 181
The Armored Cars are getting closer

182 ARCHER 182

Looks over at Solomon -- who has his arm protectively around
Dia

IN THE BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON LIGHT
The boy looks like the same innocent child he once was

ARCHER
Take yourboyhome

Solomon looks back at him tears in his eyes
He nods In deep and simple gratitude
Archer nods back Then--

ARCHER (CONTD)
Help me

He struggles to pick up the machine gun Solomon puts it
into his hands

ARCHER (CONTD)
Put the strapover my shoulder

Solomon helps secure it in place
50 CALIBER ROUNDS FROM THE ARMORED CAR
Begin to land -- short -- but getting closer
183 ARCHER FIRES A BURST FROM HIS MACHINE GUN 183

Momentarily stopping their progress

ARCHER
GO NOW

SOLOMON
GoodbyeDanny

Archers eyes flicker for a moment Smiles
ARCHER
Tell Fawaz if he tries to cheat you
Ill be waiting for him in Hell
Solomon nods once more

Dia meets Archers eyes for the first time then looks away

Solomon leads his son up the ridge

ARCHER
settles himself -- as comfortably as he is able -- among the
rocks He FIRES another burst -- to distract them from

Solomon and Dia as they climb the ridge

DOWN BELOW

The attacking mercenaries scramble for cover
ABOVE - ON THE LANDING STRIP

We SEE Solomon and Dia run for the plane We CANNOT HEAR
what is said above the ROAR OF THE PROP

BACK TO ARCHER

He has taken the SATphone from the pack In his hand is
Maddys card He dials

EXT CAPE TOWN - AN OUTDOOR CAFE -- INTERCUT
Maddy sits with a group of journalists Her cell phone RINGS

MADDY
Maddy Bowen

ARCHER
Told you I would call

Maddy is shocked to hear his voice She immediately gets up
and walks away from the table

MADDY
And Im so glad you did When am I
going to see you

ARCHER
Little problem there

MADDY
What do you mean--

Above on the ridge Archer HEARS the plane taking off

ARCHER
ListenMaddyI want youto do

By now Maddy can hear the weakness in his voice the labored
breathing Then the SOUND of gunfire from below

MADDY
Archer are you all right

ARCHER

ARCHER

Maddys eyes are welling up

MADDY
Archer---

ARCHER
Goodbye Maddy

MADDY
Archer--

The connection has been lost Archer has hung up

ARCHER 189

pushes away the phone and sits back against a mossy rock
his face in repose He looks up at the shafts of sunlight
made visible by the dust and haze

In the quiet birds flit insects buzz the leafy branches
of trees hundreds of years old sway in the breeze

It reminds us of how Solomon experienced the natural world
when first he found the diamond

He looks down -- a half-smile on his face as DROPS OF HIS
BLOOD mix with the red dirt of Africa

He looks up into the sky -- where THE CESSNA grows smaller
and smaller as it flies out of view

ARMED EO MERCENARIES 190

swarm up the hillside toward Archer We expect him to return
FIRE but he doesnt

As the first soldier reaches his position we SEE that Archer

is dead He sits with his back against the mossy rock --

eyes closed At peace at last

EXT LONDON (TO ESTABLISH) -- DAY 191
From pastoral tranquility to the chaos of urban life Solomon
stands transfixed by the noise the traffic the crowded
sidewalks of the City of London

He stands at a street corner uncomfortable in a suit two
sizes too small and stiff new leather shoes

Maddy is there by his side She gently touches his arm

MADDY
Come on Were almost there

THEY REACH THE EMBANKMENT 192
Maddy stops beside the Hungerford footbridge

MADDY
Just walk to the middle

SOLOMON
Youre not coming

MADDY
Im not here

Solomon collects himself He has survived hostile jungle
mercenaries and the RUF Yet this seems as daunting

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE 193
Solomon waits A man approaches Its Simmons

SIMMONS
You are Solomon Vandy

‘Solomon nods Several paces behind Simmons are two BODYGUARDS

SOLOMON
And you are

SIMMONS
I am the end of your journey

Simmons motions for a briefcase One of the men brings it
forward unlocks the combination opens it

Maddy is behind a wall taking pictures with a telephoto
EXT THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 135

SIMMONS
You must understand Mister Vandy
that your diamond could have ended

Solomon stares at the neat rows of POUND NOTES

SIMMONS (CONTD)

Solomon looks from the money to Simmons

SOLOMON
It is not enough

SIMMONS
I assure you two million pounds is
more than anyone will offer you for
that stone under the circumstances

SOLOMON
I want what was promised to me by
Mister Archer

SIMMONS
(swallowing irritation)
What was promised to you

SOLOMON
My family

SIMMONS
Your family

SOLOMON
They are in a refugee camp When
they are here you will get the stone
Simmons takes a moment to digest this

SOLOMON (CONTD)
I will take the money too

Simmons sees that Solomon is serious

SIMMONS
May I see what Im buying

SOLOMON
You will get the stone once my family
is here

SIMMONS

How do I even know you have it

SOLOMON
You have my word

He looks from Simmons to the other men back to Simmons
SOLOMON (CONTD)
Mister Archer told me this business
is based on a persons word Anda
deal is made with a handshake
With a cordial smile he extends his hand to Simmons
196 INT SMALL LONDON HOTEL ROOM - EVENING (MUSIC OVER)

Solomon sits on the edge of the BED waiting The little
room is littered with empty boxes of take-out

Solomon stares at a DIAMOND NECKLACE the window Hes never

seen a polished stone let alone forty in a dazzling setting

WOMANS VOICE (ENGLISH ACCENT)

He looks up to find an attractive ENGLISH WOMAN black 30s

SOLOMON

She offers her hand

JASSIE
Sola

She runs to him Solomons daughter approaches more
tentatively Solomon kneels down scoops her in his arms

Nearby Dia stands awkwardly something damaged in his eyes
Slowly he allows himself to be drawn into his father’s arms

Maddy is crying as well

The family remains in an embrace as the world moves around
them unaware of the moments significance

EXT WATERLOO BRIDGE -- DAY 201
Solomon and Simmons meet again A Bentley idles nearby

SIMMONS

Solomon nods starts to reach into his pocket

SIMMONS (CONTD)
Not here

He climbs into the waiting car Solomon warily follows

IN THE CAR 202
Simmons ASSOCIATE hands over the briefcase Simmons takes

the dirty torn-off pantleg with some distaste but when he

opens it his expression changes to wonder

SIMMONS
Extraordinary

The two associates stare at the stone in disbelief

SIMMONS (CONTD)
May I drop you somewhere Mr Vandy

SOLOMON
No Thank you

Solomon opens the door uses a phrase we have heard before

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Always a pleasure doing business
