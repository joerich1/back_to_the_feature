HicH ScHOOL MUSICAL

Authors’ Notes

As you venture into the hallowed halls of High School Musical the most
important thing to remember is to have as much fun as you possibly
can When we sat down to adapt the immensely popular Disney -
Channel movie for the stage the first thing we did was sing the music
from our high school days at the top of our lungs Godspell Elton John
Jesus Christ Superstar Billy Joel Sweeney Todd Meatloaf (yes were
dating ourselves) Two hours and two sore throats later we were back
in high school And that’s what you can do for the audience bring
them back to the days of high school - even if some havent even been
to high school yet

The characters of High School Musical may seem exaggerated on the
surface but there is something very real and recognizable in each of
them Ms Darbus is kooky eccentric and in search of her own personal
spotlight at the same time she is deeply devoted to her students and
encourages them to risk in order to grow Ryan invests a lot in being
slick and flashy but when he gets an opportunity to step out from his
sister’s shadow he learns a valuable lesson Jack Scott a new character
created to move the story along from scene to scene is shy and insecure
in front of the rest of the kids but in front of the PA mic he is smooth
confident and articulate (he has to be so we know whats going on)
Weve done our best to craft these characters on the page through
speech action and song - now it’s your job to show the audience what
makes them tick And youll do that best by bringing your own
experience to the table finding your own way into the characters and
bringing them to fresh new life on stage There is no “one right way”
to do a part design a set or stage a number so commit to your choices
keep your passion alive and have a blast

We join the rest of the development team at Disney Theatrical
Productions in dedicating our stage adaptation of Disneys High School
Musical to all the drama teachers in the world who have inspired
cajoled and launched us into the theatre providing a wide-open ocean
of possibilities and a lifeboat to keep us afloat Hip-hop hooray

SCENE 2 MS DARBUS’S HOMEROOM — MONDAY 800 AM

(Troy and Gabriella are among the last to sit just catching the end of the morning
announcements He catches a quick glimpse of her but can’t believe his eyes She sits
in the back of the class Before Troy cavi také another look MS DARBUS the school
drama teacher enters her homeroom with a grand flourish She is eccentric to say the
least but her eccentricity is fueled by a genuine love of theatre and of teaching A

small hand-held gong sits on her desk)
MS DARBUS
(with simple clarity)
“But soft What light through yonder window breaks It is the east and Juliet is

the sun Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale
y with grief That thou her maid art fap meretSF ier Seon

Hiegw ScHOooL MUSICAL

(MS DARBUS)
Neilson Kelsi stand up and take a bow

(Kelsi sinks lower in her chair and hides her head behind a book One hand rises

tentatively to accept the very tepid applause from the class)

It’s a delicious neo-feminist adaptation of Shakespeares classic tragedy of
star-crossed lovers with three — count ‘em three — tap numbers By thinking
outside the box Kelsi has brilliantly swapped out a tragic ending with a happy
ending in which the two lovers both live and move to Albuquerque It’s simply
bursting with sword fights meddling parents and teenagers caught in the grip of
forbidden love If you kids can’t relate to that Ill eat my gong Now therell be
single auditions for the supporting roles and chorus as well as pairs auditions for
our two leads

(At the mention of the musical Chad leads the Jocks in a round of dry raspberries)
Mr Danforth this is a place of learning not a football court Save your bilabial
fricatives for someone of your own primitive esthetic

’ (Troy slips his cell phone from his pocket and dials)
This year as always the Drama Club faces a dearth of male participants so please
come in and audition I’m offering you the chance to spread your wings into bold
new horizons I’m offering you the timeless allure of the greasepaint the magical
power of the Klieg light All right— I’m offering you extra credit

5 - Gabriella’s Phone

(A cell phone starts a wild musical ring At the first ring Ryan and Sharpay pull out
their cell phones)
Ah the dreaded cell phone symphony returns to our crucible of learning Sharpay
and Ryan Evans your phones please and Ill see you in detention
(Ms Darbus lifts a plastic bucket that is labeled CELL BLOCK D But the musical
ringing continues Ms Darbus searches the room Gabriella digs her phone from the
bottom of the backpack By now Ms Darbus looms over her)
We have zero tolerance for cell phones during class So well get to know each other
at detention Phone please and welcome to East High Miss Montez

(notices Troy’s phone)

Mr Bolton I see your phone is involved Splendid Well see you in detention as
well

(Ms Darbus extends the bucket for Troy’s phone Chad practically leaps out of his
chair)

CHAD
Thats not even a possibility Ms Darbus— your honor sir because we have
basketball practice after school and Troy is—

HicguH ScHooLt Musicat

MS DARBUS
Thats thirty minutes for you too Mr Danforth count ‘em
TAYLOR

That could be tough for Chad since he probably can’t count that high
MS DARBUS
Taylor McKessie thirty-five minutes
TAYLOR
But I’ve never had detention in my life
MS DARBUS
Well then Happy New Year
(Ms Darbus whirls around suddenly Cerberus the snarling three-headed watchdog of
Hades)
This ain’t my first time at the rodeo kiddies ‘Shall the carnage continue

and board are invisible placed out over the audience by the focus of the Students) q

MS TENNY (VO)
You have two minutes to solve this “Relationship between Energy and Principal
Quantum Number” equation Class give it your best shot

HiesH ScHOoOL MuSsIcaL

(Gabriella works through her equation Sharpay slithers in next to her Taylor sits at
the next table)

SHARPAY
So it seemed like you knew Troy Bolton

GABRIELLA

(distracted checking the work on her pad)
Not really I just asked him for directions
SHARPAY
Troy doesn’t usually interact with new students
GABRIELLA
Why not
(Gabriella looks at her calculation not the same as Ms Tenny’s Shes reluctant to say
anything)
SHARPAY

It’s pretty much basketball 247 with him Plus he’s such a bully always picking on
the smaller kids

(Taylor overhears Sharpay painting a fictional portrait of Troy )
GABRIELLA

(absorbed in her equation)
Thats nice
SHARPAY

He hates math And chemistry don’t get him started on chemistry I don’t think
he’s opened a book since Sally Dick and Jane — says he didn’t “get it” Typical jock
right

GABRIELLA

(still absorbed)

Cool
SHARPAY

Me And he’s a meat eater with a flatulence problem Ask anybody

(Watching Ms Tenny complete the equation Gabriella re-checks her own calculation
She raises her hand)

Oh Im sorry I was just— I mean I think it should be 10 to the negative 18th

MS TENNY (VO)
10 to the negative 18th power Thats quite impossible

(We hear the sound of Ms Tenny clicking her calculator Taylor works her calculator
as well as do most of the other Students in class)

Well Ms Montez stand corrected I’m very impressed And welcome aboard
(Taylor excitedly takes a seat next to Gabriella Sharpay tries to grab back the
conversation)

SHARPAY
Did you know Troy spent a year in juvenile hall Something to do with cats and
lawn mowers

TAYLOR
(ala Glinda from The Wizard of Oz)
Be gone You have no power here
SHARPAY

Whatever

won it before but with you on our side we might stand a chance

GABRIELLA

both looking at the list There’s something freaky about her Did you Google her

RYAN

Yeah it’s like she has an extra brain or something So why is she interested in our

SHARPAY

Shes interested in Troy barfboy Ineed you to plant those printouts in Taylors

RYAN
No problemo boss But why am I doing that

him a look of encouragement He transforms back into his squirrel and scampers away
across the stage Miffed Sharpay walks away like an angry ostrich The other Students
tentatively join the thespic twins in the exercise becoming monkeys birds etc

JAMES an enthusiastic but mostly talent-free Thespian becomes an earthworm
Gabriella works on a self-conscious canary Taylor runs in late takes in the room and
adapts immediately Becoming a horse she gallops over to Gabriella looking like she
just won the lottery She holds Web printouts)

GABRIELLA

(still reluctant)
Well okay I guess I can do it
TAYLOR
(hugging Gabriella)
Yay
GABRIELLA
Okay so like quid pro quo what do you know about Troy Bolton
TAYLOR

Troy I wouldn’t consider myself an expert on that particular sub-species unless
you speak cheerleader as in

(in cheerleader-ese)

“Isn’t Troy Bolton just the hottie super bomb”
GABRIELLA

I guess I don’t speak cheerleader
TAYLOR
Which is why we exist in an alternative universe to Troy the Basketball Boy
GABRIELLA
Have you tried to get to know him
TAYLOR

He has his clique I have mine Watch how it works in the cafeteria when you have
lunch with us Youll see

(On the other side of the stage Chad and Troy act like monkeys)
TROY
I mean you don’t think being in the musical could be fun like even a little
CHAD
You’re a hoops dude not a musical singer person

TROY

- “MS DARBUS OS BUNS
Lovely work all of you aed Thad no idea an earthworm could have such depth

such pain Now gather ina circle for our last little exposure to the magic that is
theatre A
(The Students circle around her)
This is called the Ball of Noise The idea is to pass around an invisible ball while
making’some kind of sound to go with it Once passed to the next person the ball
can land in any part of the body You are limited only by your own imaginations
YH start
(Ms Darbus holds her hand up which is suddenly shaking wildly She makes a funny
sound to go with it Then she “tosses” the ball of sound to Taylor who comes center
and finds-her own unique gesture and sound The ball passes to Gabriella Sharpay
Ryan Chad and finally to Troy’ He freezes holding the “ball” not sure what to do)
Do whatever you feel Troy There are no wrong answers Remember youre only
limited by your own imagination Now go
(Troy takes the center of the circle The ball of noise becomes a basketball and he
performs a wild Harlem Globetrotters routine with it At the end he holds it over his
head but it “grows” and gets heavier He struggles to keep the ball up)
Wonderful Troy Everyone else help him before the ball crushes him under its weight

(The other Students close in to help Troy They all hold up what is now a boulder of an
invisible ball and raise their voices to lift it up Coach Bolton storms into the theater)

COACH BOLTON

(spots Ms Darbus)
Where’s my team Darbus
(sees the ball of noise activity)
And what the heck are they doing here

the bucket as they fly out the door)

MS DARBUS

Detention is over for today Youve all done wonderfully It was an honor and a
privilege watching you risk risk risk I expect to see some of you tomorrow afternoon at
the auditions Please remember to be on time Scoot now You may collect your phones 7

¥ co Chad and Troy are my two star players you can’t have them acting like idiots
when they should be at practice
MS DARBUS
They were not acting like idiots they were acting like actors If Troy and Chad were
ys theatre performers instead of athletes would you seek preferential treatment for
a them I think not

their accompaniment They are working their butts off Suddenly Ryan throws in his
signature “jazz square” and stomps on Sharpay’s foot)

SHARPAY
You idiot
(Ryan turns off the boom box)
What did I tell you about those stupid jazz squares
RYAN
Everybody loves a good jazz square — it’s a classic And why do we always have to
do what you say
SHARPAY
Maybe because I know what I’m doing Just do what I tell you I’m not taking any
chances understand That role is mine I was born to play it
Lo RYAN -
Somebody in this room ought to chill out sister And it ain’t me Well get the roles
we want we always do
SHARPAY

Star — that’s my role And if they take it away from me who am I
RYAN
