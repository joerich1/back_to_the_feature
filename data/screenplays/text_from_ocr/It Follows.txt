EXT SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 1
ANNIE stumbles out the front door of her parents

lakeside home Shes in her pajamas - wearing red pumps She
moves with urgency and a primal fear

She looks back as she runs turning onto the street

We hear the screen door open and close again

Annie slows down a few houses down She stops and turns
towards her home standing in the center of the street

Street lamps and oak trees line the block

Its quiet Annie stares ahead - seeing something - she
starts to back up

One step Then another Click of heels on concrete

Slowly tracking backwards Annie remains focused on something
- fearful We see nothing

Nearby a young couple pulling groceries from their car
notice Annie walking in the street The WOMAN steps towards
the sidewalk - concerned

WOMAN
Hey are you ok

Annie nods to the woman but remains focused on something
else

WOMAN
You need some help

ANNIE
No

The woman shrugs to her husband and turns away

Annie turns - aware of something closing in She continues
stepping backwards

A door opens ANNIES FATHER steps onto his front porch
frazzled He looks around and sees Annie in the street

ANNIES FATHER
Annie What are you doing

Annie looks to her dad then back to the street - continuing
to move away

ANNIE
Im fine dad

( )

ANNIES FATHER
Where are you going

ANNIE
Nowhere

Annie looks back to her dad and the open door She sprints
forward rounding her imagined chaser

Annie races across the lawn towards her father

ANNIES FATHER
What the hell Annie

She hops onto the porch flashes a smile to her dad and runs
into the house Confused her father follows her

Its quiet again outside The couple carry their groceries
inside

Moments later Annie runs out the front door keys in hand - a
purse over her shoulder

She sidesteps across the porch and climbs into her car
Starting the engine Annie speeds away as her father runs
outside once more

INT ANNIES CAR - NIGHT 2
Annie drives down a dark street - with wild abandon

The radio is on

Her cell phone rings from inside her purse on the passenger
seat

EXT LAKE ST CLAIRE - NIGHT 3

Annies car is parked at the edge of a beach The drivers
side door is open The headlights are on

Near the water Annie sits alone in the wet sand facing the
car

A ring tone chimes - muffled through the cloth of her purse
She stares Focused Terrified

Annie looks ahead at the shadow-filled horizon of sand Late
night mist flows across the beams of her car headlights

Reaching into her bag Annie grabs her cell phone and presses

a button Shes nearly crying as she holds the phone to her
ear

ANNIE
Dad Hi I love you

She listens - watching her surroundings The water continues
to splash lightly behind her

ANNIE
I know I know I just wanted you
and mom to know how much I love you

Annie stares ahead We see her point-of-view - headlights
beaming down across the sand illuminating her footprints The
dark trees shift and sway

We hold on this frame even as Annie continues to speak

ANNIE
Im sorry I can be such a shit to you
sometimes I dont know why I do
that Just know that I love you ok
I just really love you both

EXT LAKE ST CLAIRE - MORNING 3A
A hard-cut reveals

Harsh morning sunlight on the sand and lake Peaceful sounds
Annie is laying along the shore Her body is pale and still

Shes dead Her jaw hangs open - head slumped to the side
Blue lips and face - covered with bug bites Her leg is
twisted back - violently rotated in its socket - a piece of
bone visible near the knee’s twisted skin Her red pump
dangles from her foot over her chest Legs open Something
awful and provocative

Water or something viscous has soaked her pajama bottoms
creating a small wet circle in the sand near her waist

A seagull pulls at a piece of skin near her toes

Cutting back to the now familiar POV shot facing the car and
the trees we see two young kids looking at the body A sister
and her younger brother They stand looking down - almost
frozen by the sight The little boy holds a kite in his hands

In the sunlight it might be possible to distinguish Annie’s
footsteps leading down from her open car door the children’s
footsteps leading up to their current position and a third
set of footprints at the far left of frame This third set
leads up to Annie and then recedes back into the treeline

The waves continue to roll
EXT JAYS BACKYARD - DAY 4

JAIME JAY HEIGHT a pretty 19 year old girl relaxes in her
hot tub - sipping a cola Droplets of sweat dot her cheeks and
forehead

A breeze pushes a swarm of white dandelion seeds through the
air swirling past the young womans face

Jay stares up at a couple of birds hopping along the telephone
wire overhead She smiles as they hop and peck - sharing some
food

A squirrel races along the wire causing the birds to fly away

Jay looks down - stretching her arms out in the hot water
She looks at her hands and legs immersed in bubbles The
bright sun reflects against the surface

Something irritates her shoulder Jay turns her head and looks
at her upper arm just above the water She sees a tiny red ant
moving toward her elbow

She watches it closely for a moment then lowers her arm into
the water dispelling the tiny insect in a swirl

The glass door slides open - KELLY Jays 17-year-old sister
leans out from the doorway in her summer clothes - it’s an
Indian Summer

KELLY
Hey Jay

JAY
Whats up

KELLY

Nothing Paul and Yara are here
Were gonna watch a movie if you feel
like it

JAY
Thanks Im going out actually

KELLY
That guy

JAY
Yeah

Kelly swings a bit - hanging onto the door handle She flips
her hair up with a goofy smile and looks to her sister

KELLY
I like him

( )
4

JAY
Yeah me too

Kelly steps inside and slides the door half-shut

Across the backyard fence Jay notices movement in the
neighboring yard

Looking closely she sees two pairs of eyes peeking out from a
pile of lumber The NEIGHBOR BOYS spy on her through the chain-
link fence A couple dumb little kids - ages 8 and 11

Jay gives them a dirty look and points

JAY
I see you

The boys duck down out of view
JAY
Dont you have a video game to play or

an animal to torture

Jay slides deeper into the tub She holds her mouth just
above the surface of the water

INT JAYS HOUSE - DAY 5
Jay walks inside wrapped in a towel her hair wet

In the adjoining living room Kelly sits with her friends
watching a bad comedy Theyre sprawled across the furniture

On tv a man talks with his English-speaking dog about the
woman he loves The dog offers bad romantic advice

PAUL 17 eats cheese curls on the lounge chair

YARA 17 is slumped into the couch cushions with her legs
across the coffee table a pair or glasses on her nose She
reads an ebook on her pink-shell-compact smartphone still
managing to laugh at the television

Jay stops alongside Kelly and watches a moment of the movie

Jay smiles and waves to Yara who glances up just long enough
to see whos around

JAY
What are you reading

YARA
The Idiot

( )

JAY
Is it good

YARA
I dont know yet Its about Paul

Paul makes a face toward Yara - irritated

Jay leans over the couch letting water drip onto her sisters
face Kelly swats her away

PAUL
Hey Jay
JAY
(smiling at the bunch)
Hey Paul

MRS HEIGHT Jays mom drinks wine and smokes in the dining
room - chatting on the telephone Laughing

MRS HEIGHT
(into phone)
Oh no Id love to That sounds fun
I could come over and cook for you if
youd like I make a really delicious
quiche Do you like quiche

The woman continues to flirt and smile through the telephone
receiver For a mother she is awkward and shy

Without looking up Yara mumbles a statement over the hokey
music of the movie

YARA
Hey I have an idea

PAUL
What

Yara casually farts staring down at her telephone screen

YARA
Oh it got away

Kelly and Paul laugh and grimace as Yara grins like a child
She scrolls and swipes reading the novel on her phone

Jay raises her brow and heads for the hallway

Paul turns and glances at Jay as she walks away - eyeing the
older girl

Yara and Kelly notice him staring at Jay They smile to each
other - aware that hes love-struck and hopeless
INT JAYS BEDROOM - DAY 6

Jay adjusts her blouse in the mirror She looks at herself -
admiring and critiquing

Leaning close to her reflection she puts on her make-up

A polaroid on the mirror shows her drinking a beer with Paul
at a dark indoor swimming pool - much younger

Dirty clothes hang from chairs or sit in piles along the
floor Old dolls boxed in a corner A scuffed and dirty
yearbook Things covered in dust - all bathed in the green and
orange haze of summer light through curtains and a nearly
imperceptible post-adolescent mist

Jay moves a lock of hair across her forehead - finessing its
placement - being picky

She laughs at herself and blows a gust of air up - causing her
bangs to flip

From across the room we watch the rest of the scene

Jay walks to her dresser and grabs a pill bottle from atop it
She opens the plastic container pops out a pill and swallows
it No water necessary

Jay sets the bottle down and re-examines her outfit and shoes
in the mirror

A pose - how does my ass look Ok

A coy glance at herself A funny bug-eyed face A raspberry
from buzzed lips and exhaled air

We hear a deep rumbling as the camera pushes in towards the
mirror moving tightly on Jays lips as she covers them in
dark pink lipstick

EXT MOVIE THEATER - DAY 7

Jay stands alongside her date HUGH waiting in a long
line to buy tickets They stand under the marquee looking
out at the street and the passing crowds

Hugh has a look of contentment on his face The couple kiss
A woman behind them glares and makes a face - jealous and
irritated by their public affection They dont notice - only
us

JAY
You ever play the trade game

( )

HUGH
No What is it

JAY
Its a people watching game My
sister and I used to play it when we
were bored

HUGH
(teasing)
Youre bored right now

Jay smiles and shakes her head in playful frustration

JAY
(stern but loving)
No Shut up Let me finish

HUGH
Alright how do we play

JAY
OK You start by watching the crowd -
casually scope out the people around
us

Hugh turns and looks at the people at the rear of the line -
then toward a group near the lobby

HUGH
Ok

JAY
Now without telling me pick one
person that youd like to trade places
with It could be anybody For
whatever reason

Hugh nods and scans the crowd Jay does the same

Jay looks around the crowds of people on the street

HUGH
Ok I got one

JAY
So now I get 2 guesses to figure out
who you picked and why you want to
trade places with ‘em

HUGH
Alright Good luck

zeroes in on a very large man with a long beard

She

( )

Him

Jay giggles and points casually at the big man Hugh looks
and laughs shaking his head

HUGH
No

JAY
You could pick up cars and throw them
if you were that guy

HUGH
Yeah but hes not my pick

7A INT MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - DAY TA
Waiting in line for popcorn with Hugh Jay looks around the
elegant lobby She notices a well dressed good looking guy

talking to a hot blonde in a short dress

JAY
That guy

Hugh shakes his head - no

JAY
I figured youd wanna sleep with the
hot blonde

HUGH
Nope Shes not even cute

Jay rolls her eyes Hugh is clearly lying about the womans
attractiveness

JAY
Ok Who was your trade

Hugh looks over at a couple standing by the stairs with their
little boy - feeding him movie theater junk food

HUGH
Him

JAY
The dad

HUGH

No The son How cool would it be to
have your whole life ahead of you

Jay shrugs - thinking about it

Jay shakes her head and smiles

INT MOVIE THEATER - DAY 7B
With popcorn and drinks in hand Jay and Hugh take their

seats Jay starts to scope out the theater and nearby patrons

The organist plays an overture

JAY
Ok My turn

Jay looks around turning back to see the rear of the theater

JAY
I got mine

Hugh smiles as he eyes the surrounding crowd - enjoying the
game Jay watches with anticipation

HUGH
How about the girl in the yellow
dress
JAY

HUGH
There
JAY
Uh I dont see her
HUGH

Right there

( )
7B

7B

Jay stares - confused - she sees no one - same as the
audience Hugh points at an empty space near the curtained
entrance

There is NO girl in a yellow dress - anywhere

JAY
Are you teasing me

Hugh looks at his date and begins to realize shes not
kidding His face changes He stares back at the walkway -
focused on something or someone unseen by us

JAY
Hugh Im sorry I just dont know who
youre talking about but thats not
who I picked

Jays smile starts to fade

HUGH
Im sorry

JAY
No Whats wrong

Hugh glances back quickly starting to stand up

HUGH
I dont think I feel like watching a
movie

JAY

Why Whats going on

Hugh sets his drink down Jay stares at him looking for an
explanation

HUGH
I dont feel good all of a sudden

Hugh is fidgeting - sweaty
JAY
Oh Well we dont have to watch the

movie You need to go home

Hugh turns his head and looks to the back of the theater He
stares Jay notices but doesnt say anything

HUGH
Um lets just go to the car

JAY
Ok

( )
7B 7B

Hugh takes Jay’s hand and leads her to the side exit
shuffling past movie-goers as they step into the sunlight

EXT CITY STREET - DUSK 8

Jay walks with Hugh towards the parking lot She notices him
glancing back - looking for something His demeanor has
changed Something is wrong

JAY
Did you see somebody that made you
wanna leave

Hugh shakes his head

JAY
Like an ex-girlfriend or something
You said there was a girl in a yellow
dress Was it someone you knew

HUGH
No I just felt sick I feel better
being outside

INT 67 FORD GALAXY - DUSK 9

Jay sits next to Hugh He drives the car down the highway -
silent

Jay turns from Hugh and stares ahead She buckles her seat
belt and watches the road - unsettled

INT RESTAURANT - EVENING 10

Jay sits across from Hugh in a cozy booth looking out at the
street through a large window

Theyre eating Italian food

Jay smiles and leans forward cat-like stealing a sip from
Hugh’s wide glass of beer

Hugh glances outside Jay touches his hand A moment of
flirting

Through a slow zoom we move past the couple focusing on the
distant intersection of pedestrians outside the window Tiny
but visible a poor working class family walk together along
the sidewalk The kids have ice cream The parents smoke
heavily A tall and very thin man crosses the road moving
toward the restaurant - he coughs and hacks into his forearm

INT 67 FORD GALAXY - NIGHT 11

Hughs car is parked on the street near Jays house The pair
are making out passionately

Mid-kiss Hugh peeks out the window looking into the dark
night

Jay pulls away from the kiss and reaches for Hughs pants
zipper He gently guides her away

HUGH
I want to but

Jay looks at Hugh - worried that she did something wrong

HUGH
My stomach still

Jay gets it She smiles and nods

JAY
Ok

HUGH
Ill see you soon

JAY
Yeah

HUGH
Bye

JAY
Bye

Jay climbs out and jogs up to her front porch pulling out her
keys Hugh drives off with a wave

INT JAYS CAR - MORNING 12

Jay drives her car along the crowded I-75 expressway - into
the city Detroit is grey and flat

A radio DJ comments on the Indian Summer
EXT WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MORNING 13
With backpack over shoulder Jay walks along the half empty

path Campus buildings loom Old architecture resting on
broken sidewalks

INT STUDENT CENTER - DAY 14

Jay eats fast food alone at a table She watches other
students pass through the large modern corridor

Jay chews and looks down at her drink A paper cup A
plastic lid A straw

The chatter mixes together into a blur of voices

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET —- DAY 15
A LITTLE GIRL on a distant porch covers her eyes and counts to
10 Her friends run and scatter behind bushes and garbage

cans

LITTLE GIRL
78910 here I come

A bunch of LITTLE KIDS are playing FREEZE TAG on a distant
front lawn They scream and laugh as they run from each other
Once tagged they stand frozen until someone else crawls
under their legs and frees them

Jay walks with Kelly down the sidewalk drinking Slurpees -
They pass by the childrens game in progress

Kelly pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights one She
takes a drag

KELLY
Thanks for walking with me

The two girls step leisurely down the block

JAY
Mom knows you smoke

KELLY
Yeah but shell cry if she actually
sees it happening

JAY
Or shell steal your cigarettes

Kelly shakes her head

Jay takes a sip from her drink She looks out at the green
lawns and clean suburban stretch ahead of her

KELLY
Hows it going with Hugh

( )

JAY
Good Mostly He was acting kind of
weird last night

KELLY
Why

JAY
I dont know He said he wasnt
feeling good but it seemed like
something was on his mind

Kelly exhales - stepping down the street

Jay looks at

Kelly starts

An old woman
animal as it

KELLY
Have you um
her sister
JAY
No I know he wants to but last
night he seemed different

to laugh at her sister

KELLY
(teasing dryly)
Maybe hes a virgin

JAY
Hes not I mean I dont know for a
fact but no

KELLY

So whats the problem

JAY
I dont know

approaches walking her dog The girls pet the
passes

OLD WOMAN
(looking at her dog)
She loves the attention

JAY
Yeah

The woman walks on and the girls resume their journey home

JAY
Youre still

( ) 15
KELLY

Jay nods
JAY
You havent

Kelly looks at Jay - then finally understands what shes
getting at

KELLY
I havent slept with anybody Not for
any real big reason or anything I
will eventually Maybe soon Any
minute now

JAY
Whenever

KELLY
Yeah

JAY

What about Paul

KELLY
Ehhh We kissed once and it didnt
feel right Hes more like a
brother although hes kind of in
love with you So I dont know what
that means

Jay smiles and thinks about it for a moment

JAY
Itd be like fucking my step-brother

Kelly starts to laugh

KELLY
Gross

The two sisters smile and share a laugh

They pass before a modest house with a pristine lawn A
fighting couple - possibly a girl mid-tantrum - can be heard
inside We see Jays POV as she stares at the brick ranch
home passing it slowly She shakes it off and continues down
the suburban block The yelling fades

Kelly takes a final drag then tosses her cigarette into the
street

( )

15 15

KELLY
Do I smell bad

Jay leans over and smells her younger sister

JAY
You smell like cherry coke banana
nicotine

KELLY

Thats my favorite flavor

JAY
Moms gonna love it

Kelly slurps her drink - making a funny sound through the
straw Jay smiles - walking through her sunny neighborhood -
looking around at the street she grew up on

JAY
Its weird still being here It’s
like everybody else went away to

school but me

KELLY
Dad said hed pay for you to go away

JAY
Im not sure I even want to Its all
kind of useless isnt it I mean
degrees dont get people jobs At
least not good ones Look at mom

KELLY
Then why are you even taking classes
dumb-ass

Nearing their own house Jay notices a very HANDSOME young man
washing his car in a driveway across the street GREG
HANNIGAN 21 sees them He waves casually - without a smile

JAY
She wont let me stay here if I dont

Kelly waves back Jay simply nods to him - walking along -
avoiding too much eye contact

KELLY
When I graduate Im getting the hell
outta here I wanna go to college
somewhere that doesnt have shitty
weather

JAY
Ok Ill visit

( ) 15

Greg resumes his car washing watching Jay as she nears her
front porch He seems very focused on the young woman

EXT WOODS - NIGHT 16
Hugh holds Jays hand leading her down a dark path into the
woods A six pack dangles from his thumb Still visible the
car headlights shine through the trees Moonlight casts a

soft glow over the area

Hugh carries a small bag over his shoulder

JAY
Where are you leading me

Hugh turns and shushes her nicely - a finger to his lips
Jay smiles and keeps walking sticking close to her date

They move deeper and deeper into the dark and foreboding
forest

A bird calls from a craggy and deadened tree Jay peers into
the dark as something scampers by

Hugh looks around as he walks - always turning and watching
EXT WOODS AND LAKE - NIGHT 17

Towels hang from an old log near a small lake - black and calm
in the night - surrounded by trees

Hugh kicks off his boxers and wades into the water gulping
his beer He smiles looking back at Jay She steps to the
edge of the lake happy and excited though shyly covering her
chest as she takes off her clothes

Jay grabs her beer from the mud and walks into the water
joining Hugh She laughs as she steps deeper

JAY
The bottom feels gross

HUGH
Its better over here

Jay reaches Hugh and he pulls her closer kissing her

Hugh watches the woods while making out with the girl His
eyes are focused

HUGH
Maybe we shouldnt

( )

17

JAY
I want to

HUGH
Me too I just

JAY
You like me

HUGH
I do

Jay kisses him harder pressing closer - its getting heavy

Hugh pulls back and looks around watching the trees and the
clearing

JAY
What Nobodys here

Hugh nods Shes right but he keeps scanning the woods
Peeking around Jay watches him - puzzled and ready - she
raises her brow

JAY
Lets go to the car

More kissing

HUGH
Yeah

JAY
Yeah

Hugh nods as he rubs his hands over Jays back She moves
with him - their energy and tension increasing

INT 67 FORD GALAXY - NIGHT 18

Jay has a bead of sweat along her forehead She holds her
arms tightly around Hugh in the back seat of the car

Jay breathes heavily her body pulsing from very recent semi-
aerobic activity Their clothes sit in a pile along the floor
of the car

A tiny smile crosses her face as she sits resting on Hughs
lap They breath in unison Rising and falling together
Jay grins as she kisses Hughs ear

Hugh looks ahead with cold and frightened eyes Something is
on his mind Something isnt right He hides his face
amongst Jays post-coital affection

EXT DARK LOT - NIGHT 19

The old Ford sits at the back of a dark dirt lot Woods and
an old factory surround the car We watch from a distance as
faint silhouettes move within the vehicle

One of the back doors opens and Hugh climbs out pulling up
his boxers He walks around the car and opens the trunk
Partially obscured we wait as he attends to something at the
back of the car

The clinking of bottles and junk The sound of a beer can
opening

JAY
Its funny I used to daydream about
being old enough to go on dates and
drive around with friends in their
cars

Some viewers might notice the absence of a license plate
INT 67 FORD GALAXY - NIGHT 20

Jay lays across the length of the back seat resting on her
stomach She kicks her heels up playfully as she pokes her
head out the open door

We hear the trunk close The sound of footsteps

JAY
I had this image of myself holding
hands with a really cute guy
listening to music on the radio and
driving along a pretty road maybe
somewhere up north after the trees
started to change color

Opening the opposite rear door Hugh crawls inside the car
laying across Jay He kisses the back of her neck Caresses
the side of her bare waist

Jay grins as Hugh kisses her She rests her cheek on the
leather seat Deep and slow breaths

JAY
It was never about going anywhere
just having some kind of freedom I
guess Now were old enough but where
the hell do we go right

Then with force and quickness -

( )

20
Hugh pushes a small cloth over Jays mouth She tries to move
away but he holds her head down until her eyes close She
stops struggling

Jay rests quietly again - a cheek on the leather seat A half
open mouth A drop of drool A long and deep breath

Darkness

The sound of wood being dragged across a concrete floor

A metal door closes

Footsteps Breathing

Jay slowly opens her eyes

INT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT 21
Jay looks around the old factory floor A giant open space

lit dimly by moonlight and distant street-lamps Several

stories up treetops line the windows

Hugh walks along the far edge of the space waving a
flashlight out windows and down long running hallways

Jay half-focuses her eyes She takes a few deep breaths

The girl is drowsy - still under the chemical spell of an
inhaled narcotic

Looking down Jay sees her arms and legs tied tightly toa
wheelchair She squirms and pulls but she cant move Her
body isnt fully responsive

Hugh looks back from across the warehouse floor

HUGH
Jay Are you awake

Jay stares across the darkness at Hugh as he slowly walks
over She tugs lightly against the rope and cloth bonds Her
eyes sag within their sockets

Hugh stops in front of her He leans down and looks at her
face He looks frightened His eyes are watery His face is
red - like hes been crying

HUGH
Im sorry

Jay tries to talk Drool edges out the crease of her mouth

JAY
Whuuuttt aarrhhh youuhhh doingggggg

( )

21

HUGH
Im not gonna hurt you Dont worry

Jay stares at him with deep fear

Hugh turns and shines his flashlight into the darkness He
scans the room Jay watches

She opens her mouth as if to yell but its nothing but a
hollow gasp - a mimic of a dry heave

Hugh shushes her with a gesture and continues waving the beam
of light around the warehouse

HUGH
You wont believe me but I need you
to remember what Im saying

Jay stares in fright

HUGH
OK

Jay nods her head - ok

HUGH
This thing

Hugh looks around the room slowly

HUGH
---Its gonna follow you

Jay eyes Hugh with growing concern This is getting worse
Hugh points his light towards a distant doorway Its empty
Jay pulls against her ties - trying to get free

JAY

(with a gasp)
Hellllppppppp

Hugh turns and looks at Jays pretty face

HUGH
Somebody gave it to me I passed it
to you back in the car

Jays eyes widen - terrified

HUGH
It can look like people you know or
it can be a stranger in a crowd
whatever helps it get close to you
(MORE )
( ) 21
HUGH (contd)
Sometimes I think it looks like people
you love just to hurt you scare
you make fun of you

Hugh stands up and rushes to a nearby window He aims his
light outside towards the ground

HUGH
I see it

Jay cranes her neck up trying to look out the far-off window
She sees nothing

Hugh runs over and wheels Jays chair towards the window Jay
looks out and down towards the adjacent field Its dark but
she catches a glimpse of a middle-aged naked woman slowly
walking around the corner of the building

Jays eyes show fear and shock

JAY
Whhhoooo isss

Hugh wheels Jay back to the center of the room
HUGH
You can get rid of it Sleep with
someone else as soon as you can Just
pass it on If it gets you itll come
after me you understand

JAY
No

Jay starts to cry

Hugh shushes her

The room is quiet

Hugh looks around - listening
They wait - longer still

We see Jays eyes in close-up as she watches We see her
point-of-view empty halls and dark doorways

Nothing still
Then

Theres a shuffling sound from a distant hallway Hugh points
his light into the darkness

( ) 21

Jay cries in silence looking towards the beam of light at the
far end of the warehouse

Finally

A naked middle-aged woman emerges from the very distant
shadows - slowly walking

Jay watches - puzzled and scared

JAY
Whooo isszzz atttehh

The naked woman still far away creeps along staring at Jay

JAY
Whudddda fucckk dyouu wannnttt

The woman contorts the muscles in her mouth - oddly -
revealing teeth and tongue She continues walking forward
Jay cringes and looks to Hugh

HUGH
Jay Im doing this to help you so
you know its real

Hugh points his flashlight at the woman as he circles closer
to her

Hugh stands along the edge of the womans path waving
slightly in her direction She doesnt look at him - only at
Jay

Jay shakes in her chair pulling at her restraints She
stares up at the naked woman - still over 50 feet away

JAY
Ehhhhh Noooo

The middle-aged woman opens her mouth again straining the
muscles in her throat

JAY
Huuughhhhh

Another step closer And another
Hugh runs across the room and spins the wheelchair around He
pushes Jay down the darkened hall as the nude woman follows

behind

Jay stares ahead in shock - passing rotting walls and rusted
industrial equipment

( ) 21

HUGH
Never go anywhere that doesnt have
more than one way out Its very
slow but its not dumb

Jay looks down at her bare legs and the passing floor Her
eyes are heavy

EXT DARK LOT - NIGHT 22
Tires kick up dirt

From a distance we watch as the old Ford swerves around the
corner and drives off down the road - racing away from the
abandoned building

EXT JAYS HOUSE - NIGHT 23
Kelly sits on the stoop of her front porch with her
neighborhood friends Theyre playing ‘Old Maid Paul pours
liquor from his flask into a Coke can Yara reads from her

pink-shell-compact cell phone while sorting her hand of cards

KELLY
Can I have some

PAUL
Yeah

Paul hands Kelly the can of pop She takes a sip and cringes
from the taste Gross

Kelly shakes off the sting of cheap booze and examines her
cards She holds the old maid card - unfortunately

She tries to maintain her poker face while looking back at
Paul

YARA
(reading from her cell
phone)
Listen to this “I think that if one

is faced by inevitable destruction --
if a house is falling upon you for
instance -- one must feel a great
longing to sit down close ones eyes
and wait come what may ”

KELLY
Thats why were drinking on the
porch

Paul grins and looks over at Kelly Yara mutters a fake laugh

( )

23

PAUL
Your mom asleep already

KELLY
Almost for sure Yeah She wakes up
at 515 I think that would kill me

We push in slowly towards Kellys hand of cards - centered on
the Old Maid - an ugly caricature of a spinster

PAUL
Yeah thats rough

YARA
I never wanna have a job

Yaras eyes dart excitedly over her cell phone screen She
smiles and nods to herself - enjoying some undisclosed prose

KELLY
I wish I didnt

PAUL
You love serving hot dogs and ice
cream to weird old people and crying
children

KELLY
Ok Thats true It brings me joy

Yara rolls her eyes at Kellys goofiness

YARA
Wheres Jay at

KELLY
Oh On a date

This bit of information seems to sting Paul He covers it as
much as possible Kelly looks to him holding up her hand of
cards

KELLY
Your turn

YARA
Who is he

KELLY

Somebody new

PAUL
Of course

( ) 23

Kelly gives Paul a dirty look as he grabs a card - the old
maid remains in her hand

YARA
Your sister is so pretty Its
annoying

KELLY

It is annoying

PAUL
At least shes nice

Yara gives Paul a dirty look He smirks back and she kicks
him in the leg

The old Ford Galaxy races up the street and stops in front of
the house Kelly and her friends turn and watch as Hugh runs
out and opens the back door on the far side of the car The
engine is still running

Kelly and her friends watch as Hugh pulls something from the
backseat Kelly begins to stand

KELLY
Is everything ok

Hugh closes the rear door stepping over something as he runs
back toward the drivers seat

HUGH
(pointing back at the
ground)
Dont let it touch you
Slamming his door shut Hugh drives off revealing Jay in the
middle of the road Still tied and bound in her underwear she
crawls toward the curb - trying to walk

KELLY
Jay

Kelly drops her cards and jumps from the porch - confused

Jay tries to stand up and move closer to the outer sidewalk -
she fails - falling in the grass

Kelly rushes across the front lawn toward her sister Paul
and Yara follow behind

INT HANNIGANS KITCHEN - NIGHT 24

GREG Jays handsome neighbor pulls a beer from the fridge
and rounds the hallway

( )

24

Wearing sweat pants and a ragged t-shirt he takes a sip as he
approaches the front door His hair is a mess - styled by
pillow

His mother MRS HANNIGAN peeks through the screen door -
flashing police lights shine through the front curtains of her
home Greg joins her looking out at the street scene a
series of police cars an ambulance and an assortment of
people

Jay sits on her porch covered in a blanket surrounded by
emergency workers Her mother in a robe talks with a police
officer near the garage

The other kids mill about the property as neighbors peek and
pass by Theres a mist in the night air covering the
suburban lawn

Greg and his mother watch The young man sips his beer
Through the screen Greg sees Jay talking with the cops

GREG
What happened

MRS HANNIGAN
I dont know

Greg watches the scene - the glare of ambulance lights His
face shows concern

MRS HANNIGAN
Those people are such a mess

Greg stares ahead - ignoring his mother
EXT JAYS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 25

Jay is mid-conversation with a police officer She sits
covered in her blanket looking across at the man

POLICE OFFICER
It was consentual

Jay nods her head

JAY
Yeah

Jay looks back at the policeman - her eyes are tired and sad

POLICE OFFICER
And youd never seen the woman before

( )

25

JAY
No

Jay shakes her head and touches her legs - focusing on her
fingers stretched across her bare knees - losing herself in
thought

POLICE OFFICER
Ok Have you ever been to his home

JAY
Not inside but I know where it is I
waited in the car for him once He
didnt want me to come in He said he
was embarrassed about where he lived

The cop nods as he writes in his notebook

INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT 26
Jay is in an emergency room partition

A doctor examines her - performing a test for STDs

Jay lays there - sad and still Her breathing is loud and deep
- each inhalation shown in labored slow-motion Pronounced
anxiety through Jays eyes

The camera begins to shake as it pushes towards the bed A
hollow rumble fills the soundscape

INT JAYS DINING ROOM - MORNING 27

Mrs Hannigan drinks coffee at the table across from Jays
mom Mrs Height takes her time pouring some sugar into her
own coffee She mixes in some Irish liquor and takes a sip
Theres a long sigh after the drink

MRS HANNIGAN
She didnt catch anything did she

MRS HEIGHT
They dont think so

MRS HANNIGAN
Poor Jaime

MRS HEIGHT
Apparently he used a fake name to rent
a house in the city The police
searched the place but they cant
find him

MRS HANNIGAN
My god

( )

27

MRS HEIGHT

It breaks my heart The things he

said to her So weird and sick
Mrs Hannigan shakes her head in sadness as she drinks more
coffee - looking around the room at the wall of family photos
Jay and Kelly smile brightly in front of wooded backdrops in
childhood portraits
In one faded picture young Jay smiles awkwardly leaning on
her grandfathers shoulder - peaking at camera The old red-
haired man grins alongside Jays mother and father
EXT JAYS HOUSE - MORNING 28
The storm door is open The wind rustles the trees

EXT JAYS SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING 29

EXT JAYS HOUSE - DUSK 34

The sky is a dark purple The house is closed up and quiet
The trees sway

INT JAYS BEDROOM - DUSK 35

Jay rests in her bed The wind blows steadily against the
window

( )

35

A glass of juice and a plate of untouched food sit on her side
table - a pickle Doritos and a white bread crust-cut
sandwich Theres a pill in the center of the napkin

INT JAYS BATHROOM - MORNING 36

Jay stares at her body in the mirror - looking down as she
lifts the top edge of her underwear She inspects herself

Did I catch something

Shallow breathing - from fear Examining under the bright
light

A terrible rumbling begins The bass and reverberations fill
the room Jay looks down

Dirty clothes hang from chairs and shower bars

The sun shines through the bathroom window A large patch of
negative space sits between Jay and the glass

Is something outside

The open bathroom door looks into the bedroom Mirrors
suggest empty space and shadows - things out of view

We wait for something to emerge
Smash

Jay jumps from fear as a ball thumps against the bathroom
window

Taking a moment she walks slowly towards the window

Jay peeks outside and sees a ball sitting in the grass below
No one is visible outside

EXT JAYS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 37
We see a reverse shot of the neighbor boy hiding beneath the
window sill He peeks back inside - covertly staring at Jay as
she walks to the sink and drinks straight from the faucet

Shes stooped and shaken lapping at the water

The rumbling resumes - growing and doubling - feeding back on
itself

EXT WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MORNING 38

Jay walks along the main path with her backpack - staring at
the edges for something unknown

( )

38

Her POV tracking forward - a half-barren campus
Jay steps ahead Nervous and cautious

The old buildings cast shadows overhead A homeless man lays
quietly on the ground - peeking at the pretty girl

Jay sees a woman walking towards her on the path Slow -
possibly handicapped or a survivor of a stroke

Jay watches her out of the corner of her eye - the female
student passes

INT COLLEGE CLASSROOM - MORNING 39

A man lectures at the front of the class Chalk marks fill
the board along with the printed notation of Fall Semester
Sociology

20 or so young adults sit throughout the room at desks and
chairs - shorts and t-shirts fail to fend off the humidity
Jay writes notes by pencil at the far edge of the classroom
The large windows to her right show the adjacent square

Jay bites on the edge of her pencil as she stares out at the
campus The heat is visible

Sweat forms on her skin She fans herself with a book
Greg sits on the opposite side of the classroom - near the
back He glances over at Jay - watching her with concern and

curiosity

Students walk lazily along the pathways near the square Jay
watches them walk The teachers voice fades from her ears

A few people relax on blankets in the grass - sharing food and
talking

Jay sees an OLD WOMAN IN PAJAMAS walking very slowly -
emerging from behind a row of trees She focuses on the woman
as she hobbles along

The old lady steps directly across the blankets of studying
students passing between couples without notice She stares
with her mouth open looking directly at Jay

Jay takes a breath and watches with frightened eyes

The old woman walks closer and closer to the building moving
past some shrubs - approaching the windows

Jay tenses up She stands awkwardly grabs her bag and walks
out of the classroom

( )

39

TEACHER
Uh Jay are you

Jay closes the door without a word Greg looks out to the
hallway with concern

TEACHER
OK Well

INT MAIN COLLEGE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 40
The heavy door opens a crack Jay peeks out - just an eye

She sees a few college students chatting together near the end
of the hall An administrator pushes an AV cart out of a
nearby classroom

Jay opens the door the rest of the way and steps into the

hall She looks around as she makes her way down the long
passage

She eyes classes in session

Jay runs her hand along the wall A few more steps onward

Far off - at the opposite end of the hall - Jay sees the old
woman walk very slowly into view

Jay swallows hard as her breathing quickens She watches with
curiosity and fear as the old woman stares ahead and moves
closer

Jay stops and waits

The CHATTING STUDENTS a few girls laughing and gossiping in
the middle of the hall fail to notice as the old woman walks

straight through their semi-circle

Jay stares puzzled over the lack of attention to the old
woman in pajamas

Though still far off the old woman keeps coming closer

JAY
Hello

The old woman doesnt respond

One of the chatting girls turns back and looks at Jay - giving
her a funny look Do I know you

CHATTING GIRL
Hello

Jay says nothing in reply She fixates on the old woman

( )

42h

40

The chatting girl shrugs and laughs turning back to her
friends

The old woman moves closer with crippled steps - mouth agape
Scared Jay turns and runs out the nearby exit doors

INT JAYS CAR - MORNING 41
Jay drives her tiny economy car through levels of the parking
structure Descending the camera reveals row after row of
cars - students with backpacks - empty spaces - shadows

Jay appears tense and on-guard as she steers

EXT DETROIT ZOO - DAY 42
Jay walks past the Rackham Bear Fountain - kids throw

pennies into the copper water We follow behind her She
appears nervous - keeping her distance from others - scanning
the crowds

To her right lions sprawl across the floor of their den

Giraffes step through the Egyptian exhibit as Jay crosses the
nearby walkway

EXT CONCESSION STAND - DAY 42A

Jay walks up to a large concession stand where Kelly and Paul
are working

In uniform Kelly serves cups of cola and hotdogs to zoo-
goers Near the counter with supplies in hand Paul notices
Jay and stops

PAUL
Hey what are you doing here

JAY
I need to talk to my sister

Paul rests the food package against the counter He sees the
look of anxiety on Jays face

PAUL
You ok

JAY
Uh huh

Jay nods but she doesnt convince him

( )

42A

PAUL
Were both taking a break in a few
minutes If you want to sit down and
wait

Kelly works feverishly in the background

JAY
Ok

Jay looks around at the passers-by Her neck and eyes betray
her nervous energy and bird-like jitters

Paul pulls his damp uniform away from his chest in an attempt
to feel some sort of breeze

PAUL
So hot out isnt it

JAY
Yeah

Jay has sweat on her forehead and arms but she seems
unaffected

PAUL
Want some ice cream

Jay looks back at the young man and nods She really would

JAY
Thank you

INT POLAR BEAR AQUARIUM - DAY 43
Sitting in the underwater tunnel Jay leans against the glass
rubs her temples and holds her face as she tries to relax

Paul and Kelly watch alongside her

KELLY
Jay whats going on

JAY
There was an old woman at school
today She was staring at me it

seemed like she was following me

Jay stares down the tunnel at a group of strangers Eyeing
them carefully

Kelly tries to hide her worried face
PAUL

Did you know her

( )

43

JAY
No but she freaked me out I didnt
even go back to class

A few children in silhouette stare through the glass at the
swimming polar bears They shuffle along in awe

KELLY
Did she say something to you

Jay shakes her head She looks down at the ice cream in her
lap She nibbles on the dessert as her sister and friend watch
with quiet concern They exchange a look between one another

JAY
Hugh told me that he passed it onto
me That something was gonna follow
me
The light from the water adds a pulsing shimmer to her face

KELLY
Thats all bullshit Jaime

Jay looks up at her sister and stares back with wide eyes

JAY
Yeah I know

An enormous polar bear swims overhead - a passing shadow
PAUL
What exactly is supposed to be
following you

Kelly glares at Paul - dont encourage this

JAY
I dont know

KELLY
You should tell mom what you saw

JAY
No

KELLY
Well Jay Im worried about you

Jay focuses on her ice cream Small delicate bites Kelly
watches her older sister pick at the dessert with a spoon
like a young child - shoulders pointing inward

We see the trio together from outside the tunnel through the
blue icy water

( ) 43
The surface is visible just above with pristine white glacial
walls behind them Jays figure appears stretched and
distorted through the calm water

For this moment we hear only the pulsing of water within a
reverberating tank

KELLY
We gotta get back

Paul nods and Jay begins to rise from her stooped and
sheltered position

PAUL
I could stay over tonight if it would
make you feel better
Jay and Kelly simultaneously glance in Pauls direction
JAY and KELLY
(together )
No

Paul shrugs

PAUL
Like on the couch or something

KELLY
No

Jay considers for a moment

JAY
Maybe on the couch

Kelly rolls her eyes as Paul grins from a minor victory
KELLY
You should be more worried about
waking up and finding Paul humping
your leg

JAY
Thats true

PAUL
Um

The girls laugh
PAUL

Im choosing to ignore these insults
to my character

( ) 43

KELLY
(to Jay)
Just keep your door locked

Jay nods finishing her ice cream with a small grin

PAUL
I will stay up all night and keep an
eye out for anything weird Nothings
gonna happen OK

Jay looks up at Paul and her sister - exhaling a light breath
INT JAYS BATHROOM - NIGHT 44

Yara sits on the toilet in her pajamas clipping her toenails
while chewing on a red vine She appears focused

Jay and Kelly brush their teeth in front of the sink laughing
to each other in the mirror Kelly wears her old and tattered
Amanda B’s Dance Team shirt

With toothpaste filled mouths

KELLY
Mom just went to bed

JAY
Did she say anything

KELLY
No She saw Paul on the couch I
dont think she cared She had her
bottle of merlot

Jay nods - understanding the subtext More tooth-brushing

JAY
I keep thinking that something must be
wrong with me Even right now it
feels like Im ten feet away from
myself The walls seem far away I
dont even like looking across the
room I feel overwhelmed

Yara continues clipping tapping her nail-tool against the rim
of a tiny waste basket

YARA
(matter of fact)
Its probably anxiety
JAY
Will it go away

( )

44

Yara nods - chewing more licorice
KELLY
But it can really fuck with you if you
let it So dont
Jay spits into the sink
EXT JAYS HOUSE - NIGHT 45
The night is quiet A few lights remain on inside the house

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 46

An empty and dark street No cars pass Most households are
asleep

Static shots of dark alleys sickly oak trees backyards
illuminated by security lights

Rusted chain link fences

A dirty above-ground pool Water sloshes gently through an
intermittent filter

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 47
On the television a monster roars and a woman screams

Paul sits on the couch watching a black and white horror film
Blankets and pillows cover the couch He eats popcorn and

candy in the dim room

Theres tinny gunfire from the television Alien sounds
reverberate

Paul tosses some more popcorn in his mouth as the on-screen
hero embraces the damsel in distress

The woman on the tv cries and kisses the hero Paul slumps
into his pillow with a sigh

INT KELLYS ROOM - NIGHT 48

Kelly sleeps soundly in her bed Yara is awake in her sleeping
bag reading Dostoyevsky via cell phone

The monster movie can be heard faintly
Through Kellys window we see the outer yard Its mostly

dark and very still We hold on the window - moving closer to
it - watching - waiting

INT MRS HEIGHTS BEDROOM - NIGHT 49

Jays mom is asleep on her bed Shes sprawled across the
crumpled comforter in her night robe

A bottle of wine and empty glass sit on the dresser
INT JAYS ROOM - NIGHT 50
Changing into bedtime clothes Jay glances out her window

Across the alley she sees the 11 year old neighbor boy spying
on her from his bedroom window

Jay jumps out of surprise She covers herself and pulls the
blinds down as the neighbor boy hides behind his own curtains

Bothered and momentarily frightened Jay sits on the floor

next to the window listening to the television echo from the
hallway

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 51

We follow behind Jay as she carries her blanket and pillow
down the hallway into the living room

Still awake and watching a midnight movie Paul sits up and
fixes his hair as the pretty girl plops down on the smaller
love-seat across from him

JAY
I cant sleep - not in there

PAUL
Thats ok Sleep here

Jay smiles and pulls the covers over herself
They sit together - quiet - watching the television

PAUL
You really ok

Jay pauses - then looks at Paul She shrugs her shoulders

PAUL
Everythings gonna be cool

Jay nods her head On the television several soldiers lure a
giant monster into an electrical trap

PAUL

Its funny I havent spent the night
over here since we were kids

( )

51

JAY
Theres a reason for that

The pair crack smiles

PAUL
Shut up Im serious Its cool to
spend time with you

JAY
Yeah

PAUL
We used to hang out all the time
Remember

Jay nods

PAUL
At some point it mustve been weird
for you having a guy friend that was
younger than you

JAY
I dont know I think we just grew
apart right Or you and Kelly got
close Its not a big deal is it

PAUL
No Not a big deal

On the tv a soldier flips a switch and sends a giant arc of
electricity into the towering monster

JAY
You were my first kiss you know

PAUL
I know

JAY
Was I not yours

PAUL
No You were

JAY
And you kissed Kelly She told me
You kissed two sisters thats kind

of gross
Paul grins

The monster in the movie shrinks and disappears under the
electrical charge

( )

51 51
PAUL
Do you remember that time we found all
the porno magazines in the alley by
Barrys Pizza

JAY
Yes

Jay shakes her head with a smile - silly memories

PAUL
We were such stupid kids

JAY
Ridiculous

PAUL
Were all sitting on Gregs front lawn
with a dozen dirty magazines sprawled
everywhere and were laughing
Jay chuckles at the memory

JAY
We had no idea how terrible it was

Paul starts to laugh
PAUL
And Gregs mom Remember her face
when she came outside and saw us all
sitting around reading that shit
Jay laughs along with Paul
JAY
She scooped them up so fast Called
my mom too Me and Kelly got a sex ed
lecture the next day

PAUL
I got one too

Jay and Paul smile to each other from across the room
They hear the sound of glass breaking

PAUL
What the fuck

Paul stares at Jay - worried

JAY
Go look

( )

51 51

Paul hesitates He jumps up and steps to the edge of the room
- trying to determine where it came from

Jay watches scared behind the covers on the love-seat
Paul turns the corner exiting the living room
Jay waits

Heroic and celebratory music pours from the tv as the credits
roll

Jay scans the room - the windows

A moment later Paul returns He stands at the corner of the
large room

PAUL
Theres a broken window in the
kitchen but nobodys there

JAY
Are you sure You looked around

PAUL
Yes

Jay doesnt appear comforted

PAUL
Whoever broke it ran away

JAY
We should call the police

PAUL
Im gonna wake up your sister She
should probably call

JAY
OK

Paul steps out of view - heading for Kellys room
PAUL
(0S)
Im surprised they slept through that
JAY
(speaking to no one)
Yeah
Jay sits alone on the couch She pulls the blanket from her

legs - adjusting on the small couch

( ) 51

Silence

Jay stands up and walks slowly towards the edge of the room
She rounds the corner - stepping closer and closer to the
kitchen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 52
Jay hesitantly peeks inside the kitchen doorway

A HALF-NAKED YOUNG WOMAN with a slight resemblance to Jay
walks very slowly towards her Small steps

Shes missing her two front teeth while urinating through her
brown suede skirt

Dark circles around her eyes A tube sock on one foot The
other bare Immodest and vulgar

Jay chokes on a scream and backs away

She knocks over some household nick-knacks as she crosses the
dining room

Rushing towards the stairwell - Jay runs up to the homes
second floor A mad dash

INT JAYS UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 53
Jay reaches the top landing and races towards the large rec
room Inside she slams the door shut locks it and backs up
towards the far wall
She breathes and listens
Footsteps
A knock on the door

JAY
Its in the kitchen

PAUL
(behind door)

Jay doesnt move
PAUL
(behind door)
Theres nothing here

Jay gets up and slowly walks to the door She reaches for the
handle and turns it

Peeking out she sees Paul and Kelly standing alone

JAY
Get in here

Jay waves them into the room Once inside she closes and re-
locks the door

Kelly stands with arms crossed while Paul sits on the edge of
a chair

KELLY
Jay why dont you sit down

Jay paces and looks from the door to the second-story window
She crumbles down onto the floor

Kelly and Paul are silent

( ) 53
JAY
I need water Oh my god I need some
water
KELLY

Ill get you some

JAY
No Stay here

Jay shivers and holds herself

JAY
Is something wrong with me

PAUL
Somebody broke the window That
really happened

JAY
Yeah but I saw a girl in the kitchen

Jay pushes herself against the wall - almost in shock Kelly
comes over and rubs her shoulder

KELLY
I love you Youre ok Its gonna be
alright

JAY

You dont believe me

KELLY
Not all of it no But some of it

Theres a tapping sound at the door All three kids turn and
stare The doorknob shakes a bit Almost turns - but stops

KELLY
Mom

Knock Knock Knock Three soft taps on the door

Jay crawls across the floor towards the window shushing her
sister with a panicked gesture

Worried Paul picks up a broom from the corner of the room and
stands near the door - wooden stick raised

KELLY
Mom is that you

Jay shakes her head

( ) 53
YARA
(behind door)
No Its me

KELLY
Yara

YARA
Yup

Kelly stands and approaches the door She unlocks it grabs
the doorknob and turns

JAY
Dont open the door

Kelly opens the door revealing
Yara sleepy-eyed and bored stands in the doorway holding
her glasses She rubs the sleep from her eyes while chewing

on a red vine dangling from her mouth

KELLY
See Everythings ok

Suddenly -
A VERY LARGE MAN peeks out from behind Yaras shoulder -
bending his head down into the door frame like some kind of

giant He stares at Jay

Jay screams as the large man follows Yara into the room -
remaining just inches behind the petite young woman

Paul looks at Jay - confused No one but Jay sees the long-
limbed giant moving closer

Jay rushes to the back window opens it pushes out the screen
and crawls through

Kelly Paul and Yara run towards her trying to hold her arms

KELLY
Jay be careful

PAUL
Hey wait

EXT JAYS ROOF - CONTINUOUS 54

Jay pulls her arm away and steps onto the edge of the roof
She stands looking down

( )

54
The large man walks very slowly towards her visible through
the frame of the window - over Paul Yara and Kellys
shoulders

Jay turns and steps along the edge of the roof towards the
side of the house

Kelly looks out the window as Jay moves from view

KELLY
Jay What are you doing

PAUL
(to Kelly)
Ill get her
Paul runs into the hallway - disappearing down the stairwell

Jay lowers herself to the fence and hops into the alleyway

A boys bicycle leans against the neighbors house Jay grabs
it jumps on and rides off into the street

INT GREGS GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 55

Greg sits with a pretty girl in his open garage smoking a
joint Theyre flirting - his hand on her leg

Greg notices Jay pedaling the kids bike into the street He
watches puzzled as she rides off Paul emerges from the
front door

EXT PARK - NIGHT 56

Jay rides the bike into the middle of the park She stops in
an open area near the swings and an old spider-web jungle gym

Rusted cartoon faces hover over the play area on the tops of
the gyms posts

The chains of the swings rattle in the wind

Jay steps off the bike and lays it down on the sandy ground
She looks around at the open park Large elm trees and dirt
paths spread out around the grassy patches of the block

Jay watches for movement Its quiet and still

She walks across the lot towards the swings and sits down -
nearly in shock - trying to calm herself - looking for
something grounded and real

She starts to swing - very lightly A young woman in pajamas -

alone in the night

( )

56

Her feet slide across the sand and she holds them higher

Jay watches the park Swinging

Forward Back A dog barks in the distance Crickets chirp
The dog stops barking Its quiet again

The swing creaks quietly - the sound echoes across the trees

Jay sees a figure approaching through the trees - partially
hidden by the darkness

She stops the swing and watches - afraid - ready to run

PAUL
Jay

Kelly Paul and Yara emerge from the darkness of the park
Meeting in the open lot Kelly runs up to Jay

KELLY
You couldve hurt yourself What are
you doing

The sisters hug Amid their embrace they whisper

JAY
(whispers )

KELLY
(whispers )
Me too but well figure it out

JAY
(whispers )
You cant tell mom Shell freak out

KELLY
(whispers )

Jay sees something A silhouette moves through the street All
eyes turn towards the approaching shape

JAY
Do you see that

( )

56 56
KELLY
I do
YARA
Its a person

Stepping into the light from nearby street lamps - Greg
emerges from the darkness

JAY
Greg

GREG
What the hells going on

Jay struggles to find a response

GREG
Are you ok

Jay nods Paul glares at Greg - unnoticed

PAUL
Somebody broke into their house

GREG
Shit Did you call the police

Jay shakes her head no

JAY
I dont want to go home

GREG
Where do you wanna go

Jay exhales - looking up at Kelly

JAY
I need to find him
GREG
The person who broke into your house
JAY
No
KELLY
Hugh

Jay nods Its a small and meek response from a normally
strong young woman

GREG
What did he really do to you

( ) 56

Jay shakes her head and shrugs looking down at the ground -
rubbing her eyes with her hand

Kelly offers Greg a look - let Jay be

GREG
(quiet)
Ok

The gang stands around in silence - amidst the quiet park

Greg turns and starts to walk away Jay notices him walking
off

JAY
Are you leaving

GREG
No Im getting my car Somebodys
gotta drive right

Greg jogs off Kelly and Jay sit down on the edge of the
merry-go-round looking out at the shadowy park The sky has
nearly achieved its pre-dawn blue

INT GREGS CAR - DAWN 57

Jay sits in the passenger seat while Greg drives Paul Yara
and Kelly sit in the back Yara snacks on a large donut while
reading from her phone Chocolate on her fingers

The car drives into the inner city The neighborhoods become
poorer - more decayed and urban

Jay sees a pair of middle-aged women walking carts down the
street A third and older woman trails behind them Jay
notices her watching their car as they pass The sound of
Gregs engine grows louder - feeding back on itself
unnaturally

Further on Jay sees a homeless man standing behind a

telephone pole on the side of the road The man is perfectly
divided by and almost hiding behind the pole

They pass him and continue on

EXT HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 58
Gregs car pulls up and stops in front of an old inner-city
house It sits alongside an overgrown field with a distant
view of the towering Renaissance Center

Early morning fog drifts across the face of the brick

building

( )

58

A patch of police tape is strung across the front door A sign
on the lawn reads FOR RENT

EXT BACKYARD OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 59
Paul stands on the gas meter pulling a window open Jay Greg
Kelly and Yara stand along the back wall of the house looking

around at the weed-filled lawn and adjoining backyards

As Paul crawls inside we hear the jingle of clinking cans and
a bell rattle

A dog begins to bark loudly from a distant yard

Jay notices an old woman peeking out from behind a neighboring
house The woman stares suspiciously then disappears

Paul opens the back door gesturing for the gang to enter

INT LIVINGDINING ROOM OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 60
The camera pushes forward through a dark hall

Tiny beams of morning light shine through the covered windows
Large swathes of shadow obscure the details of the dim space

A dusty mist fills the air

Piles of debris rest on the coffee table Couch cushions are
flipped The television is face down on the floor

Jay and Greg walk cautiously into the dark living room

Moving to the curtain-covered bay window Jay stares at an odd
collection of cans bottles and bells that hang from string
across the entire length She runs her hand over the
primitive alarm

Clink Clink jingle jingle

Greg discovers a similar string of cans and bells across the
smaller side window

INT BATHROOM OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 61
Kelly rifles through drawers and checks the medicine cabinet
She finds several bottles of pills The labels have been torn
off

Bits of daylight shine through a tiny window above the shower

Kelly sees a bloody razor blade on the floor near a stack of
towels

INT KITCHEN OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 62

Yara opens the fridge and makes a funny face at the sight of
open leftovers and rotten fruit

YARA
I dont think he spent a lot of time
here
INT BATHROOM OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 63

Kelly notices a crack in the wall of the bathroom She runs
her hand along the split in the dry-wall Kelly applies some
pressure and a large piece of wall falls away - revealing a
hole leading to the adjoining room

Jay peeks through the hole to her sister
JAY
He told me never to go into a room
that didnt have more than one way
out

Kelly shakes her head - surprised by the oddness of the
situation

INT BEDROOM OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 64
Paul enters the upstairs bedroom Water-stains line the wall
An old mattress sits on the floor Debris and clothes boxes
fill the space

Paul digs carefully through the cardboard boxes - sorting
through a few remaining articles of clothes A couple pairs of
socks Some underwear

INT KITCHEN OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 65
Standing on the counter Yara digs through the upper cabinets
using her cell phone to illuminate the junk inside Greg stops

nearby looking up at her legs Admiring

Yara peeks into the cabinet Pushing aside a dusty row of
mugs

A cockroach runs out and scampers across her hand

YARA
Ehhh Fuck

Yara shakes her hand in disgust Greg chuckles

INT BASEMENT OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 66

Kelly walks alone through the garbage filled cellar The
camera pushes slowly through the dusty shadows toward a ground
level window Theres tension as we near the sun-misted glass

Nothing passes
INT BEDROOM OF HUGHS DETROIT HOME - DAWN 67

Under some crumpled and stained tissue paper Paul discovers a
small stack of porn magazines

He lifts them and sits on the edge of the bed sifting through
the various covers

He selects one and casually flips through the magazine -
perusing a nude womans pictorial

Jay enters the bedroom and sees him She shakes her head and
moves to the bedrooms far window Its taped over with
newspapers and comic book pages A few tears allow some
morning light into Hughs grim-looking sleep quarters

Jay peeks through a hole in the comic book page looking down
at the nearby field She sees a homeless man walking through
the tall grass He disappears behind a tree Jay backs away
quickly bumping the string of cans with her arm

Paul turns another page and finds a loose photo wedged inside
He pulls the picture out and examines it

PAUL
Hey look at this

JAY
What

PAUL

Is this him

Jay moves to the bed and looks down at the photo in Pauls
hand She sees a younger teenage-version of Hugh with some
old girlfriend They both have bad haircuts The girl a
cheerleader is wearing a boys oversized high school
letterman jacket It reads Lawson Vikings

PAUL
Do you recognize the letterman jacket

JAY
Lawson High School

Paul nods in agreement

PAUL
Somebodys gonna know his real name

Jay looks closely at Hughs smiling face
INT LAWSON HIGH SCHOOL HALL —- DAY 68

Down a long locker-filled hallway Greg and Jay walk together
towards the main office

A few kids pass them walking to class - dodging work

INT LAWSON HIGH SCHOOL HALL —- DAY 69
Through a medium-sized window in the hall we see a couple

high school kids making out behind a tree - only pieces of the
action from a distance A teen boy in ugly clothes walks by

eating an apple

The camera pans crossing the hall and focusing on the nearby
main office

INT LAWSON HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY 70
Through the glass we watch as Jay and Greg speak with a couple
of school employees The photo sits on the counter between
them

One woman grabs a large book from a shelf opens it and flips
through pages as a man types slowly on his old computer Greg

watches

Jay stops and turns looking out past us and the camera
scanning the area - she is constantly on guard

Jay turns back and listens as the woman talks
The camera pans again back towards the window
Outside the couple are still kissing behind the tree

A YOUNG WOMAN WITH RED HAIR is walking towards the building
carrying a backpack

A few teen girlfriends cross the window laughing and
chatting

INT GREGS CAR - DAY 71
Paul and Kelly sit in the back seat of the car like kids
waiting for their parents Yara sleeps on Kellys shoulder

Greg and Jay open their doors and hop into the front

The high school building is visible through the front window

PAUL
Did they know
GREG
Yup
JAY

His real names Jeff

In the distance the young redhead with a backpack is visible
walking towards the car Shes quite far away No one sees
her

PAUL
Not Hugh

GREG
(shaking his head)
Jeff Redmond

KELLY
Do we tell the police

Greg starts the car The radio comes on - quiet A seat-belt
alarm dings repeatedly Greg buckles up - Jay doesnt

JAY
No

The redhead walks closer as Greg backs the car up and pulls
out of the school lot No one sees her except us (and
probably only some of us)

Paul sees Jay and Greg share a moment of eye contact Greg
rubs Jays shoulder for comfort

Paul makes a face - slightly irritated

72 EXT HILLY SUBURBAN ROAD - DAY 72
Gregs car pulls up in front of a large upper-middle-class
house on the more rural edge of the county Well manicured
lawns enhance the neighborhoods stature

Jay climbs out of the car and walks up to the front door Her
friends pile out of the car and stand around it like a ragged

gang from a B-picture version of West Side Story

Jay rings the bell and waits She looks down the street -
watching the empty road

The door opens and a friendly middle-aged woman in a rumpled t-

shirt and mom jeans greets Jay MRS REDMOND smiles and
looks to her

( )

72

MRS REDMOND
Hello

Jay stares at the woman - taken aback Mrs Redmond is a dead-
ringer for the naked woman seen earlier at the abandoned
warehouse

JAY
Hi Um Is Jeff here

MRS REDMOND

Yeah He is Um Do you wanna come
in

JAY
Yeah

Mrs Redmond glances back at Jays friends by the car

MRS REDMOND
Your friends

JAY
Thatd be great

Jay waves her sister and friends over
INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 73

Mrs Redmond leads Jay and her friends down a long hallway to
the back of the house

They reach a doorway Mrs Redmond knocks

MRS REDMOND
Hey Jeff you got friends here

Silence

MRS REDMOND
Jeff

JEFF
Yeah mom Im coming

The door unlocks and opens Jeff looks out past his mom to
Jay and her gang His face reveals the awkwardness and stress
of the moment He tries to hide it from his mother

JEFF
Hey

Jay looks back at him - waiting for something

( )

73

JAY
Hey

MRS REDMOND
Well Ill leave you kids alone

Mrs Redmond walks back down the hall Jeff looks at Jay
She stares him down

No one notices but on Jeffs left wrist the edge of a
bandage peeks out from under his long sleeve shirt

JEFF
You wanna come in

Jay shrugs and steps into Jeffs bedroom Paul Kelly Yara
and Greg follow Jeff appears uneasy

Jay looks around the room Its a very typical boys bedroom -
probably too immature for Jeff

Tired Yara lays across the bed and watches the scene unfold

Greg closes the door blocking Jeff in He hovers near the
young man as though hes about to punch him

Seeing that hes trapped Jeff looks over at Jay

JEFF
Im sorry

Jay ignores him - looking at a small candid photograph on
Jeffs dresser

In the photo-booth strip Jeff smiles alongside a laughing and
happy young woman Annie

JEFF
You dont know how horrible I feel

Greg smacks Jeff in the face

GREG
Fuck you

Jeff does nothing in return He has tears in his eyes

JEFF
Are you gonna call the police

JAY
Im not sure yet

( ) 73

JEFF
(his voice is weepy and
weak )
Please dont tell my family Ok

JAY
I just want to know whats going on

JEFF
Ok but can we talk outside Its not
safe in here Its really not safe

EXT JEFFS BACKYARD - DAY 74

Jeff sits before an open expanse of lawns and landscaped
backyards There are no fences here

On the grass at the edge of the patio Jay and her friends sit
around the host - like a teenage mob Theyre drinking soda
pop from straws

Mrs Redmond steps outside - smiling She sets out a tray of
baked snacks for the group

MRS REDMOND
Ok I hope you like puffed crispy
treats

PAUL
Thank you

Yara grabs a crispy treat and begins to eat

MRS REDMOND
Of course Youre welcome

The kids nod awkwardly as they sip their cola beverages The
mother smiles and walks inside carefully sliding the glass
door closed

Once gone all expressions change Jeff maintains a low
whisper trying to conceal the situation from his mother His
eyes are red from crying

JEFF
(looking at Jay)
Even though its following you I can
still see it its not done with me
either It just wants you first Like
I told you all you can do pass it to
someone else

Jay picks at the ground pulling up a blade of grass and
tearing it into smaller strips placing them on her leg

( )

74

KELLY
What the fuck are you talking about

Further down the block a TEENAGE GIRL IN A SOCCER JERSEY
appears cutting across the neighbors back lawns on her way
home For now she appears as a dot on the horizon - too
distant to be seen by anyone

JEFF
She can do the same thing I did It
should be easier for her Shes a
girl

Jeff turns and looks straight at Jay

JEFF
Any guy would be with you Just sleep
with somebody and tell them to do the
same Maybe itll never come back

Paul stares longingly at Jay from behind his can of soda We
see the figure of the soccer girl begin to take shape in the
distance A casual stroll - a backpack slung over shoulder

PAUL
Is that really possible

GREG
Bullshit Total fucking bullshit

Jay pulls apart the blades of grass within her palm - fixating
on the tiny details of the plant

KELLY
(looking at Jeff)
You should take it back

Jeff looks at Kelly - making a face
KELLY
(to Jeff)

You know what I mean

JEFF
It doesnt work that way

JAY
(almost to herself)
I would never sleep with him again

Greg exhales - growing frustrated with the nature of the
conversation

( ) 74

GREG
This isnt real I promise you the
whole thing is some fucked up game

Jeff looks at Jay - her melancholy profile - down-turned Over
her shoulder he finally notices the teenage soccer girl
walking in his direction - still far away The camera zooms in
on the girl Jeff is clearly distracted and frightened

JEFF
Im not safe either OK We shouldnt
be in the same place You need to get
the fuck out of here

GREG
Watch it

Jeff glances back to the soccer girl She strolls lazily
across the lawns A bit closer

JEFF
(getting nervous)
If it kills you it comes back to me
and then all the way down the line to
whoever the hell started it

Jay stares down at her hand - losing herself in the slight
movement of her flesh and fingers - something grounded and
real Paul watches her with sadness and longing

JEFF
(nervous and quick)
Jay Im sorry I wasnt trying to
hurt you Somebody did this to me too
ya know

Greg is sweating now He steals another look at the soccer
girl She looks back at him - then looks down

KELLY
Who did it to you

JEFF
(nervous )
I met a girl at a bar it was a one
night stand I dont even know her
name I think thats where it came
from

Greg rolls his eyes in frustration

GREG
Jeff I dont believe you

( )

TIA 74

Jeff focuses completely on the approaching girl Hes
fidgeting - ready to stand and run

GREG
She might but I think youre a liar
This is some fucked up shit youre -
(doing to her)

Jeff interrupts -

JEFF
Do you guys see that girl right
there

Jeff points and stares in the direction of the passing soccer
girl Everyone turns around and looks at the shy teenager
bobbing her head to the music She notices and makes a worried
face shifting her path away from Jeff and the group

KELLY PAUL JAY GREG YARA
(simultaneous ) (nodding)
Yes Yeah Uh huh

Jeff regains his composure He tries to adjust

JEFF
Ok Good Um listen Jay

Jeff faces Jay directly

JEFF
Wherever you are it’s somewhere
walking straight for you but it is

walking If you drive far enough you
can buy yourself some time to think
decide if you wanna give it to someone
else

Jay glances down at the ground as Greg and Paul sit silently

Paul steals a look toward Jay

luggage

KELLY
(to Greg)
Um Greg

GREG

KELLY

Kelly nods and smiles leaning closer to Jay
KELLY
(whispering)
Have you thought about what he said
Jay takes a pill from her purse
JAY
(whispering)
What
KELLY
(whispering)
Maybe passing it on
Jay shakes her head as she swallows the pill with some water
JAY
(whispering)
I don’t know

Kelly shrugs a bit Paul peeks at Jay out of the corner of his
eye - under the cover of sleep

Highway signs pass by

fields

Beyond the house is a medium-sized lake

The gang start to climb out stretching in the morning sun
Greg unlocks the door and steps inside

INT LAKE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING 84

Jay and Paul string bells and bottles over the windows and
doors Sitting on the floor - threading old soup cans with
string Jay speaks into an old 70’s-style phone receiver

JAY

(into phone)
Hello yes um this is Mrs Height

daughter Kelly is sick with the flu
and she’s gonna be out for a few days -
uh maybe longer

(beat )
Uh huh Yeah I know It’s the season
change I guess

(beat )
Ok well thank you Bye

Kelly fries bacon at the stove while making pancakes for the
group She watches her sister from across the room

A radio on the counter plays an old AM rock tune

Yara dances by herself to the music snacking on bacon as she
reads her ebook Swaying and stepping - her moves are
intentionally silly

Greg drinks a beer on the couch staring at Yaras ass

whenever possible

Family photos of Greg and his parents line the walls Old
remnants of joyful times litter the room

Hanging up the phone Jay stands at the edge of the kitchen
looking out the window She watches the empty field driveway
and lake

Birds chirp happily in the distance

EXT OLD SHED - MORNING 85

Greg unlocks the door to a shed behind the house He pulls a
metal case from the dusty shelf

Inside he finds a small HANDGUN and some bullets
Greg closes the case and tucks it under his arm
EXT FIELD - DAY 86

Greg stands next to Jay as she fires the handgun at a far-off
row of canned goods and mini cereal boxes

He helps to adjust her aim

Kelly and Paul watch from the distant grass - as shots ring
out and echo Yara reads from her phone

Paul seems irritated

GREG
It sucks sticking around after
everyones gone huh

JAY
Its a bit lonely

GREG
Im right across the street you know

JAY
I remember

BANG A full size box of Fruity Fun Cereal is hit causing a
trickle of colorful rice to pour from the bullet hole

EXT BOAT and LAKE - DAY 87

The boat is anchored in the center of the lake The water is
calm

The breeze passes like a whisper across Jays bangs She

turns onto her back and lays out across the front of the boat -
feeling the warm sun

Greg dives into the water while Paul cannonballs in
Kelly sits near her sister while Yara dips a toe in the lake
from the safety of the rear ladder - sipping a beer and eating

snack chips

JAY
I feel safe out here

KELLY
Well stay as long as we can Mom
doesnt care

JAY
I wonder how long itll take before it
gets here

KELLY
Jay theres nothing coming ok

Jay looks back towards the shore and watches the tree-line and
the open field She stares deeply at the land Nothing
moves

EXT BOAT and LAKE - DAY 88

Yara dives underwater kicking her feet above the surface
Loud splashes

Kelly holds on to the anchor-rope floating calmly on her
back

We notice Greg glancing over at Kelly treading water with
beer in hand

Jay swims alone

Drying his face with a towel Paul watches her from the boat

A bell rings Jay turns and sees Paul step through her
doorway He closes the door with a final rattle and ring

Jay stares up at him from her bed Rain pours against the
window

JAY
Hey
PAUL
Hi How are you
JAY
Um I dont know
PAUL

Yeah

Paul sits down on the side of her bed He looks over and eyes
her She glances back

Theres a silence in the room Jay shifts under her covers
Paul reaches over and holds Jays hand They sit in silence
Jay stares down at their hands - intertwined She appears a

bit uneasy

Paul leans down and tries to kiss Jay She pulls her head
away

JAY
No Paul

PAUL
What

Jay doesnt know what to say

PAUL
I know you feel kind of alone and I
just wanted to tell you that Im

here for you

JAY
I know

( )

93

Paul takes a breath Its getting awkward

PAUL
No I mean Im here for you

Paul places his hand on Jays leg Finally understanding what
hes saying she politely moves his hand away

JAY
Oh um Paul I

Paul swallows hard as Kelly knocks on the door The bell
rings as she walks into the room

Shes in a towel Seeing Paul she rolls her eyes and gives
him a shake of her head

KELLY
Out

Jay smirks as Paul leaves the bedroom

EXT LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT 94
Rain pours from the gutters on the ground

Drops ping off the side of the awning

The lake dances with volatile drops of water

Rain falls across the windows of the lake house

EXT FIELD - MORNING 95
A grey mist has settled over the area

Jay relaxes on one of the lawn chairs in the center of the
field - near the lake A breeze tussles her hair She appears

calm but sad

Kelly Greg and Paul lounge around her - some on the wet grass
- others in chairs

Paul stares lovingly at Jay She watches the horizon

Behind Jay - over her shoulder - we watch as Yara steps from
the forest into view - far off - by the dirt road

Yara walks closer Paul looks off - into her direction
Greg notices Kellys leg - stretched across the grass She

sees him checking her out His warm eyes cause her to look
away - more from shyness than anything else

( )

95

Greg gulps and finishes his beer as he stands - dropping the
can into the grass He walks off - trudging towards the
distant trees

Paul looks up at the sky - raising his hand up to feel the
sun Behind him we see Yara in her bathing suit floating
across the shallow edge of the lake on a circular inner-tube
She floats lazily by - a small but visible shape in the
background

There are clearly two Yaras One is in the water One is
approaching behind Jay

Paul looks back to Jay She turns to her side and looks back
towards the lake house Behind her Yara is now much closer -
continuing to approach

YARA
You should get in the water

From her inner-tube Yara looks back to her friends Kelly
glances over to her sister Jay yawns and stretches

KELLY
You want to

JAY
No You go ahead

We see Greg - very far away - step into the trees drop his
shorts and start to pee

KELLY
Come on

JAY
Eh

KELLY

Get up Itll be nice

Kelly starts to get up We see the group lounging together in
the field

JAY
Maybe in a little bit

KELLY
Don’t be so lazy

As Jay sits in her chair her long hair rises into the air -

without cause or explanation - like a Michaél Borremans’
painting

( ) 95

Kelly and Paul see this occur Jay immediately realizes
something is behind her She jumps from her chair screams and
steps backwards The chair topples An invisible force pulls
her head down and prevents her from moving more than a few
feet She pulls backwards - a tug of war - her hair is the
rope

JAY
Help me

Kelly takes a step closer - tentative with confusion

KELLY
Jay What is it

Paul jumps up and grabs the fallen chair He swings it down
into the air

We watch as the chair smashes into an invisible object -
cracking - hurting Pauls hand

Jay’s hair is released - dropping back to her shoulders She
tumbles away tripping over a cooler and falling to the
ground Kelly rushes to help her

Paul steps closer - suddenly he’s pushed violently across the
grass - landing on his shoulder

Jay crawls and stumbles away from the advancing thing The
fake Yara follows her - bloodied but unfazed

In the distance Greg quickly pulls up his shorts and starts
to walk back - a cautious hyper-aware gait

GREG
Will you guys tell me whats goin
on

The real Yara rushes through the shallow water and helps Jay
up She pulls her towards the lake house as Paul manages to
stand backing away from the center of the field - terrified
and unsure how to help

Kelly runs after her sister Jay keeps moving - glancing back
and pointing

Yara or something that looks like her follows The gap
widens but the thing keeps coming Slowly of course

Jays friends and sister pass right by the thing as they rush
to her aid They see nothing

Greg is still far off - approaching along the edge of the

Jay is backing away - screaming pointing and staring at
nothingness

INT LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 96
Jay picks up the hand gun and runs to the door

KELLY
Whatre you doing

Jay raises the gun up She aims at the thing Yara stares
back at her Mouth open

Paul is almost hyper-ventilating at the edge of the room He
sees nothing but a frightened and hurt young woman aiming a
gun into the air He hides behind the couch

Jay waits until it gets near She aims at its face - Jay
pulls the trigger

Bang
Greg dives down - taking cover in the grass

PAUL
Fuck

The bullet slices through Yara’s forehead and ricochets out
her temple Blood pours from her skull as she slumps to the
ground

GREG
(in distance)
Stop shooting

Greg jumps up arms in the air He starts to come closer

KELLY
Jay please

The bloody Yara rises and continues walking towards Jay as
though nothing happened

As Greg moves toward Jay with his arms in the air she raises
her pistol once again She fires several times - the bullets

Jay steps back and pulls the front door closed

INT LAKE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 96B
Jay locks the front door and slumps onto the ground She
starts to cry Kelly tries to hold her but she cant be
consoled

Paul lifts his shirt and sees a swollen red welt across his

abdomen

Jay peeks up toward the front window She sees a large man
looking in through the glass He shuffles slowly to the side -
out of sight

Smash

Theres a loud pounding from the front door The wood shakes
It hits again The banging gets louder

A foot breaks through the bottom of the door

The women scream Paul jumps in fear

Yara watches as wood splinters from the center - seemingly
without cause

Jay watches as the foot kicks out a medium chunk of paneling
from the bottom of the door The foot retracts and
disappears

Silence - except for the soft crying within the room

The friends and siblings look to the door - waiting

Slowly we push in closer on the hole

Greg appears looking in through the broken door - his head
tilted at an angle

GREG

disappears from view

What the fuck son-of-a Was it you

Silence

We hear only Jay Kelly Yara and Paul breathing deeply
Frightened and labored breaths

Outside its quiet
JAY
Greg
He doesnt respond
JAY

Greg are you ok
Jay leans closer to the door peeking into the hole
Suddenly
A very LITTLE BOY WITH A STRANGE FACE pokes his head into the
opening Jay screams and jumps as the little kid crawls

through the hole in the door

KELLY
Jay what do you see

The innocent looking boy stares at Jay and screams loudly -
like an elderly woman

Jay flinches and covers her ears She pulls herself up and
scrambles away grabbing the car keys from the table

Theres a pounding from the other side of the house

Jay runs toward the rear door

Now inside the little boy steps across the room

Paul follows Jay as she unlocks the back door revealing Greg -
pounding on it

GREG
What is going on

Jay pushes past him moving outside

PAUL
I dont know

Greg stares into the lake house with anger and confusion - we
dont see anything other than hysterical teenagers

GREG
(muttering to himself)
What the fuck

Yara is crying on the floor while Kelly stands shaking - in
shock Greg marches past them

Jay runs to the car fumbling with the key fob unlocking the
door

As Jay climbs into the drivers seat Greg emerges from the
front door of the lake house He inspects the crack in the
door

INT GREGS CAR - CONTINUOUS 98

Starting the car Jay sees a young woman Annie walk past
Greg and the others - staring at her from a distance

Greg is shouting - trying to calm everyone down

Jay continues to cry - not loudly - just streams of
involuntary tears She throws the car into gear

Kelly runs from the side of the house spotting her sister in
the car

KELLY

We back up at a mad speed turning and racing up the dirt road
towards the highway

The engine roars - and whines
Kelly Yara Paul and Greg watch as Jay drives off

Where are you going Thats my

The house the friends and Annie recede into the background

Jay stares ahead in shock Her hands are shaking on the
steering wheel

The teenage girl presses down on the gas She steers wide -
turning a corner in the road

Jay looks back over her shoulder Panicked

Up ahead a pickup truck begins to pull out from the
intersection Protected by a stop sign - nothing more

Jay is going too fast Unable to stop The truck tries to
swerve

She pulls at the wheel hitting the brake and cutting left
Losing control

She crashes hard into a bank of trees

INT HOSPITAL - DAY 99
Jay opens her eyes Her head is slightly bandaged around her
forehead A small circle of dried blood rests on the cotton

wrap - an IV in her left arm

Her right arm is covered in a cast - extending from her
fingers to her bicep

Jay sees the foot of her hospital bed A monitor and the open
doorway leading to a hallway

She stares into the hall An empty waiting room is visible
beyond another door

A NOSY WOMAN passes by - peeking over at Jay
An unseen MAN screams in pain from a distant room
OLD MAN
(OS)
Somebody come and help me I need some
helppp Somebody please I just need
some helppp

Jay watches the door - she begins to frighten herself Her
breathing grows shallow

She looks down and presses the call button It rings but no
one responds

The hallway appears empty The mans cries are silenced The
call button beeps intermittently

JAY
Hello

Jay stares into the doorway

JAY
Helloooo

The camera moves closer and closer to the open space

Kelly steps into frame walking from the waiting room around
the corner She crosses the hall - an expression of sadness on
her face

Jay sees her coming She stares - fearful and suspicious Her
breathing is heavy

JAY
Kelly

Kelly simply nods and smiles reassuringly shrugging her
shoulders Of course its her

Jay doesnt believe it

JAY
(still afraid)
Is it really you

KELLY
(nodding once again)
Yeah Its me

JAY
(relieved)
Ok

Jay tries to stop herself from crying She sobs as her sister
comes closer and holds her - leaning down over the bed

JAY
Does mom know

KELLY
Yeah She came earlier

JAY
How long am I gonna be here

KELLY
I dont know

( )

JAY

KELLY

JAY

How far are we from the lake house

KELLY
Far

Kelly sits up and yawns pulling away from the hug She leans
back revealing -

An OLD NURSE staring down at Jay a tray of food in her hands

Jay sees the pale woman and is startled She immediately
freaks out pulling away and kicking her food tray to the
floor

JAY
No Get her away from me Can you see
her Shes right there

Jay points at the nurse Kelly tries to calm her sister
grabbing her arms

KELLY
I see her Its just a nurse Shes
bringing you food
(looking to the nurse)
Im so sorry shes really scared

Jay turns her face toward the pillow She takes deep breaths
NURSE
Well get her something to help her
relax
JAY
(mumbling)
I dont want anything

Jay gasps for air

Everything goes dark the noises of the hospital warp and
distort

We hear the sound of Jay breathing

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK 100
Jay opens her eyes again

She sees her mother sitting in a nearby chair The door is
closed

Paul Greg Kelly and Yara lay around the room - scattered in
odd places chairs the end of the bed the window sill

The television is on but no one is watching it Its nothing
but a half-muted light source in an otherwise dim room

We hear voices - whispering around us Nothing sounds right
MRS HEIGHT
(muted)

Was she taking her medicine

KELLY
(muted)
I dont know I think so

Jay begins to cry

Mrs Height moves close holding her hand against her
daughters forehead

MRS HEIGHT
Jay you ok

Jays face shows exhaustion and fear Her crying intensifies

The young woman sobs and wails like a hurt child Her mother
holds her while Kelly wipes tears away from her cheek

JAY
(whispers )
I dont wanna die

MRS HEIGHT

Youre not gonna die Youre ok It

was a bad accident Thats all

Youll be home in a few days

Jay continues to cry Greg stares from his seat
JAY
(whispers )
Its gonna catch me

Jay sees Greg She looks to him for help

JAY
(whispers )
Itll be here soon

Jay lays against her pillow sobbing lightly staring at Greg
EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT 101
We watch from outside
The camera tracks along the exterior of the hospital windows -
past the sleeping and the sick A man on his deathbed A
women hobbling to the bathroom A family laughing silently
behind glass A child eating over a tray

We settle on Jays hospital room - looking in - through the
window from a distance

Greg leans over the bed as Jay whispers something into his
ear A private moment He nods and says something in reply

We slowly move closer A tiny creeping dolly forward

They are alone The rooms door is closed

Greg takes her left hand and holds it

He kisses her and moves closer Greg undoes his pants and
pulls them down Jay lifts the blanket up and pulls her
underwear off

Greg climbs into the bed with her touching her body She
pulls his boxers off and holds him with one arm - keeping her

cast off to the side

Greg moves on top of Jay She looks up at him as he positions
himself inside her Greg stares down at Jays beautiful face

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 102

Jay looks over Gregs shoulder to the closed door She
watches - waiting - as Greg makes love to her

Her head and face shake - rising and falling as the young man
moves faster - fucking her harder

Jay stays focused on the closed door - holding Greg in her
arms

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 103

Jay sits alone in her hospital bed The room is very quiet
She stares out - lost in thought

Is it gone

( )

103
We sit with Jay for a few moments as she takes a sip of water
and then looks down at her hospital gown Her legs The cast
on her arm

Jay waits for something to happen She watches the empty
doorway

INT COLLEGE FOOD COURT - DAY 104

Greg eats a sandwich fries and coke while chatting with some
girls at a table Many people cross by

Greg laughs with his mouth half-full

INT HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM —- DAY 105
Kelly rests on a small couch - magazines on her lap

Paul sits in a chair - watching across the hallway - looking
into Jays room He watches Greg smile and chat with her -
casually eating applesauce from Jays food tray

Jays face is partially hidden by the edge of the doorway

Paul stares with obvious envy

INT JAYS HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 106

Flowers line the window sill - the sun shines brightly inside

JAY
You havent seen it

GREG
Nothing

Greg takes another bite of applesauce

JAY
Really
GREG
(eating)

Jay nods her head - unsure

GREG
I dont think its coming

Jay rests in her hospital bed

( )

106

JAY
You believe me right Youre not just
playing along

GREG
No I believe you
Jay nods
GREG
I just dont think its following

Jay stares at Greg Worried

GREG
Isnt that good

JAY
Yeah

Jays face doesnt seem relaxed She takes no comfort in
Gregs words

JAY
Im sorry about your car

GREG
Its just a car

He smiles and takes one more bite of applesauce - licking the
spoon

EXT JAYS BACKYARD - DAY 107

Jay sits in the hot tub with her cast hanging over the side -
looking out at the neighboring yards A dullness in her eyes

The back door is half-open
A small television rests on the deck - playing the local news

On the tv Bodies are carried from a collapsed building The
news announcer chatters away about the incident

Jay stares out at her backyard lawn - and the lawns of her
neighbor’s - yards stretching into infinity

INT JAYS HOUSE - DAY 108
Jay steps inside her house - drying off with a towel
Its quiet

She walks slowly down the hallway to her room

INT JAYS ROOM - DAY 109

Opening the bedroom door Jay notices that her dresser drawer
is open The underwear drawer

Looking across the room she sees her bra underwear and a
pair of socks laid out across her bed - as though mimicking a
body

Fear crosses her face

JAY
Kelly Mom

No one answers Jay looks around for an intruder

Walking towards the bed Jay passes a dresser a mirror and
various posters on the wall

She reaches the bed and picks up her bra She leans down and
peers out the window

Nothing

Standing up Jay sees a BOY reflected in the mirror Startled
she screams - spinning around - falling back against the bed

Its the 11 year old neighbor boy - hiding against the wall -
panties in his hand He takes a step forward - arm extending -
worry on his face

NEIGHBOR BOY
I just wanted to see you Im sorry

JAY
Get out of here

The boy drops her underwear on the floor and runs out of the
room - into the hallway

Jay sits there Catching her breath

EXT JAYS HOUSE - DUSK 110
Kelly and Paul sit on the porch talking drinking and

listening to music Near the garage - Yara is chatting with

someone on her pink cell phone

Greg walks out from his front door He crosses the street and
approaches the gang on the porch

GREG
How are you guys

( )

110

KELLY
OK

Paul nods - choosing not to speak

Yara closes her phone and joins her friends - sitting down
near Paul

GREG
Hows Jay

Greg looks in the direction of the house - where Jay is Kelly
shrugs her shoulders

KELLY
Not great

PAUL
Have you seen anything

Paul stares Greg down - letting him know that he knows
Yara covers her tiny grin - theyre all in on it

Greg silently shakes his head Nope

The group is quiet for a moment as they consider this

GREG
Is it cool if I go in

KELLY
I dont think so She doesnt want to
open her door Shes just hiding in
there

GREG
I thought shed be doing better

Greg looks towards the closed doorway Kelly stares at him -
waiting for something back

KELLY
I can have her call you later

GREG
Yeah ok

Paul watches silently - a brooding stare from the corner of
the porch

YARA
You really havent seen anything

( )

110 110

GREG
Nope

PAUL
She didnt make it up

GREG
Well know sooner or later right

Greg looks around - thinking about the possibility He scans
the empty street and the rows of manicured lawns extending
into infinity

PAUL
That chair cracked in mid-air
something knocked me over and the

door it didnt break on its own
GREG
Something happened but its not

what she thinks

KELLY
What do you think it was then

Greg shrugs his shoulders and steps off the porch

GREG
Ill see you guys

KELLY
Bye Greg

YARA
Bye

Greg walks across the street Paul watches him go - happy to
see him leave

111 EXT SUBURBAN PARK - NIGHT 111
The dark trees of the park sway in the night breeze
112 EXT SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 112

A dog barks from behind a fence The houses sleep The
street is quiet

113 EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 113
We see the full neighborhood from above

Scattered house lights and street-lamps form pools of
illumination across the flat Michigan suburbs

INT JAYS ROOM - NIGHT 114

Jay sits by her window in pajamas watching the dark
neighborhood

Empty yards

A car passes

Jay yawns - a hand over her mouth
Near silence Some crickets

Jay sees Greg walking slowly down the sidewalk He turns and
heads up the path to his house

Jay knocks on her window trying to get his attention
Greg reaches the front door but it wont open for him
Jay watches - a bit confused

Greg picks up a large stone and walks towards the front window
of his house

Jay realizes something is wrong She grabs her 80’s handset
phone and dials Gregs number It goes straight to voice-
mail

Greg breaks the glass and begins to crawl into his home
through the opening

Jay leaps up and stumbles out her bedroom door
EXT GREGS HOUSE - NIGHT 115

Sprinting to Gregs front yard Jay pounds on the door - pulls
at the handle

JAY
Greg Open the door Greg

Theres no sound from within Jay looks to the broken front
window - she runs to it and begins to crawl through

INT GREGS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 116
Falling to the carpet Jay clutches her cast-covered arm and
looks around the dark room She stands up and moves through
the house

JAY

(running)
Greg Its in the house

( )

116A

116

We hear a soft and distant tapping from above A clock chimes

GREG
(OS - distant)
Jesus mom Im sleeping

Jay runs through a dark hallway reaching the base of the
stairs She goes up

INT GREG’S HOUSE UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 116A

Running up the stairs Jay hears the sound of knocking -
louder A tap tap tap on wood

JAY
Greg Watch out

Reaching the top of the stairwell Jay stops Ahead of her
at Gregs door is his mother Mrs Hannigan

Mrs Hannigan is knocking on the door She looks over at Jay
as she continues to knock

Jay stares - suddenly understanding whats happening

GREG
(from inside - groggy)
What the fuck is going on Fucking son-
of-a

JAY
Greg its outside your

Greg opens his bedroom door - wearing only boxers He sees
his mother standing before him in her open bathrobe - breasts
half-exposed

GREG

(groggy )
What the fuck mom

Mrs Hannigan puts her arms around Greg Her legs climb up -
feet clawing - wrapping herself around him He falls backwards
disappearing into the bedroom

Jay circles the doorway looking in She sees the woman
straddling Greg holding tightly as he convulses - his eyes
rolled back - revealing white and veins A fallen lamp
flickers and strobes The room appears to shake

The mother pushes herself against Greg - bare legs - a loose

robe - indecent His hand struggles against hers - their
fingers intertwined

( )

116A 116A

A heavy rush of fluid pours down onto Greg’s boxers - soaking
the carpet

The young man stops moving Hes dead and pale - his tongue
edging out the side of his mouth

The thing looks back at Jay and stands It begins to follow
her as she backs up along the hall landing - down the stairs

Jay runs to the front door - fleeing the house
INT JAYS CAR - NIGHT 117

Jay pulls out of her driveway wildly She drives down the
street as Greg walks out of his front door - staring at her

INT JAYS CAR - NIGHT 118

Jay cruises along the expressway She tries to slow her
breathing She wipes some tears from her face

INT JAYS CAR - NIGHT 119
The radio is on A beautiful pop song plays from the

speakers Jay is tired as she steers along the near empty
expressway

INT JAYS CAR - NIGHT 120

Quiet now Heading down a rural highway

Jay pulls her car into a long dirt drive She follows the
tree-lined path deeper

EXT WOODS - NIGHT 121
Jay parks and gets out of her car along the edge of some light
woods She moves around the car and climbs over the front
fender sitting on the hood

Jay lays back and stares up at the night sky She turns her
head and watches the empty road - illuminated by a lone street
lamp She waits

EXT WOODS - DAWN 122

Jay sits on the roof of her car facing the road She stares
out at the empty path

She hears something A sputtering engine Voices in the
distance

Jay climbs down and follows the sound through the trees -
toward the rising sun

EXT CLEARING AT LAKE - DAWN 123
Stepping out of the woods Jay finds herself along the edge of
Lake St Claire She looks out at the deep waters as a
motorboat slows in the distance

A few shirtless YOUNG MEN drink beer in the boat as it rocks
and sways Listening to music they dont notice the young
woman on shore

Jay focuses on the men A thought crosses her eyes

Jay takes off her pants and shirt as she steps into the lake
She moves out bracing herself against the cold - letting her
cast drop carelessly into the water

She swims further The boat is ahead The young men grow
closer and closer

Jay slows and stops Shes near the boat now The music and
laughter is louder She looks up at the figures of men -
considering She starts to call out but stops Her eyes
show melancholy as she paddles in place

I cant do this

Jay exhales and drops down into the water

Shes gone

We sit on the surface of the lake watching the young men on
the boat drink and laugh Eventually they start the engine
and cruise off along the horizon

A flock of birds fly overhead

The water is still

Jay pops up several yards away - nearly out of frame - gasping
for air She fights to swim back

EXT JAYS HOUSE - MORNING 124
Jay drives the car down her street - her hair still damp - the
cast soaking wet As she pulls into her driveway she sees
Kelly and Yara sitting on the porch - haggard and sad

INT JAYS BEDROOM - DAY 125
Jay is resting on the floor of the darkened room A towel is
wrapped around her cast Some light peeks in through the half-
drawn shades Kelly and Yara are sleeping on the bed - passed
out - a space of mourning

Yara snores a little

( )

125

The old sandwich sits untouched on its plate The bread has
grown moldy The pickle is dry The Doritos remain orange and
unchanged

The television is on Old commercials sell products

Theres a knock at the door Jay opens her eyes

JAY
Who is it

PAUL
Paul

JAY
Hang on

Jay gets up and pulls the chair away from the door she
cautiously opens it peeking out into the hallway She sees
Paul - alone

He steps into the room Jay quickly closes the door and
barricades it

Paul sits down on the floor next to Jays nest of blankets and
clothes She sits alongside him pulling her t-shirt down as
she stretches her legs across the blanket with little regard
for modesty Her focus is singular - a melancholy has settled
in her eyes

They sit in silence together for a moment Yaras snoring
quietly rattles from the mattress

JAY
Its gonna be here sooner or later

Paul takes a breath - hes thought about it He speaks in
whispers

PAUL
You could pass it on

Jay shakes her head She wont Not again

PAUL
You did once

JAY
I shouldnt have

Jay looks ahead at the black dress slung over her chair

PAUL
I could

( ) 125

Jay looks at Paul - direct eye contact

JAY
No

A moment passes Paul stares at Jays profile She watches
the window

PAUL
I liked you too ya know

Jay takes a breath fidgeting with her t-shirt She knows

PAUL
Why did you pick Greg

Jay looks down at her legs She pulls them closer to her
chest - she taps her knee lightly

JAY
I thought he would be ok
(beat )
He wasnt scared

Paul listens
JAY
We slept together in high school It

wasnt a big deal

Paul nods - not agreeing but feeling the need to respond
somehow

He leans in and starts to kiss Jay She pulls away
immediately

Paul reaches over and touches Jay’s fingers - extended just
beyond the edge of the damp cast She maintains her gaze on
the window - with a soft sigh - exhaling tension

PAUL
I wanna help you

Paul caresses Jays hand She stares off - disconnected from
his touch

JAY
Do you

PAUL
Yeah I do

Jay pulls her hand away slowly

( ) 125

Paul takes a deep breath He looks around the dim room Its
messy now Clothes are scattered

A dirty and tangled shirt hangs from the hamper A bra sits
on the floor - half covered by a dirty tennis shoe

Kellys hand hangs from the edge of the bed

Jay crawls over to the window and peeks out She watches the
street through the low hanging branches of the trees as they
sway A kid rides past the house on his bike

Gregs front window is covered with plywood There’s a police
car parked in his driveway Jay begins to cry - she’s given

up

Paul watches her - crouched and scared at the windows edge
He notices her underwear at the bottom of her taut shirt

The young man looks away in frustration A deep exhale He
holds his gaze against the far wall - noticing an old photo
taped to the mirror

It’s a picture of he and Jay - younger - standing together
with wet hair and bathing suits by an old indoor pool Smiling
- beers in hand

PAUL
Jay

JAY
(still staring out the
window)
Yeah

PAUL
Do you trust me

Jay nods and turns to Paul - ready to hear
PAUL

Well do you remember where we were

the first time we kissed
Jay nods yes
INT JAYS CAR - LATE DAY 126
Jay climbs into the passenger seat - behind her we see Yara
and Kelly getting into the back and putting on their seat
belts Paul closes the trunk and climbs into the driver’s

seat

Outside the neighbor boys are playing ball in the front yard
They steal glances towards the car and Jay

( )

126

KELLY
You know where to go

PAUL
I know how to get there Mostly
KELLY
Alright
YARA
I havent been to the pool since I was

PAUL

Who brought you
Yara kicks Paul’s seat - not smiling

PAUL
Ok

Paul starts the car and begins to back up He throws his arm
over the passenger seat and guides the car backwards Music
plays from the radio

As the car reverses we see more and more of Jays house - the
roof is revealed Jay is looking the opposite way

An OLD NAKED MAN is standing on the roof - looking down at
Jay No one sees him

KELLY
Thats where I had my first beer I
threw up that whole night

YARA
Into the pool

KELLY
No Outside the car

PAUL
And in the car

YARA
Ewwww

Paul backs up to the edge of the driveway - waiting for cars
to pass

KELLY
Paul used to pee in it

YARA
Disgusting

( ) 126

PAUL

Not really Whatever Theres

chlorine
Jay glances back towards her house
On the roof she sees the naked wrinkled man with red hair
standing on the edge - staring at her Hes fully upright
shoulders out standing on the roof He doesnt move He
just watches her
Jay holds her breath in fear

Paul pulls into the street and puts the car in drive

Jays view shifts as the car lurches around - rides the bump
of the soft curb

Paul accelerates and guides the car down the street
Jay turns away and stares ahead - tears in her eyes
EXT JAYS CAR - DAY 127

We speed along Interstate 75 - going south We see only the
road racing towards us - scenery changing

The hum of the car engine
Deeper and deeper into the city we drive

Passing exit signs for mile roads Ducking under rotting
overpasses

Broken buildings wave from the edge of the expressway Gutted
plants momentarily block out the harsh sun

Dangerous streets and alleyways loom along their path

The camera slowly rotates around pointing back through the
front windshield - revealing Paul behind the wheel Jay sits
in the passenger seat Kelly and Yara are in the back The
kids are solemn and quiet The hum of the road is hypnotizing
- tiring

They sit in silence as they drive on

EXT DETROIT STREET - DUSK 128

Storefronts boarded houses rotting factories and empty lots
fill the frame

Jays car is parked along a fence near a boarded store-front
We move through the poor neighborhood - slowly

( )

128

Jay and the girls follow Paul - looking out at the half empty
neighborhood

Paul carries a large duffle bag over his shoulder - a small
television in hand The girls have backpacks Yara lugs an old
boom-box

YARA
When I was a little girl my parents
told me I wasnt allowed to go south
of 8 mile I didnt even understand
what that meant It wasnt until I
got a little older that I realized
that was where the city started and
the suburbs ended I started thinking
how weird and shitty that was I had
to ask permission to go to the state
fair with my best friend and her
parents just because it was a few
blocks past the border

JAY
My parents said the same thing to me

Everything is bare - revealed in the fading sunlight A few
young men hang-out on the street They watch the kids as they
pass

A homeless man shuffles closer

EXT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 129
Small figures in the darkness Jay and her friends walk up to
a large stone structure at the edge of an inner-city
neighborhood

Paul pulls open a loose window and begins to crawl inside

INT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 130
The gang steps into a large indoor pool room An enormous and
ornate ceiling frames the giant swimming pool spanning the
length of the building It’s dark except for a few dim pool
lights and the glow from the upper story windows

Water reflections cross Jay’s face as she steps to the

poolside - kneeling down along the tile in her shorts and t-

shirt - bedclothes for a warm night

PAUL
How long do you think it will be

Jay shakes her head

( )

132A

130

JAY
I dont know Hours I bet

Jay dips her hand into the water and looks deeply through the
walls of the room - beyond the water and the brick

PAUL
Its been a long time since we were
here together

Jay nods her head splashing the water gently

PAUL
You kissed me right over there I
think

JAY

Is that how you remember it

PAUL
Uh huh

Jay raises her brow - a sad smile on her face

Across the way Kelly and Yara stretch out in the shifting
shadows of the pool

EXT CITY - NIGHT 131

Rain clouds fill the skyline changing the nature of the
moonlit city

INT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 132

Paul pulls household irons curlers and a radio from his
duffle bag - rolls of extensions cords

Jay empties her backpack onto the ground Yara places a small
television near the edge of the pool

The girls string electrical cords across doorways and under
chairs toward the water

Plugging in tattered cords to dusty outlets

Along the edge of the room Paul digs through a utility closet
- unearthing an old space heater

INT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 132A
Extension cords stretch and snake across the tile floor - all
leading to various small appliances placed precariously along

the edges of the pool Irons curlers radios and a tv - all
turned on Quiet static and heat

( )
132A

132B

133A

132A

Jay sits scanning the area waiting for it Eyes steady on
the entrance

Yara stands further back - arms crossed - scuffing her shoes
nervously along the ground She looks over at Jay with
sympathetic eyes

Paul sits quietly Kelly paces near the windows

Jay stares down at the ground moving her fingers across the
grout and the tile

They wait
OMITTED 132B
EXT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 133

We see the old building Static Quiet
Thunder rumbles in the distance

Lightning strikes beyond the tree-line - small wiry lines of
light in the ink-washed sky

A few drops of rain begin to fall Gentle on the concrete
Calm like the sound of waves

INT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 133A
Now wearing her bathing suit - Jay climbs slowly down the
ladder into the pool Adjusting to the feel of water in

darkness

Alone in this large body of water Her friends watching from
the edges

The sound of rainfall on windows - mixed with the gentle slosh
and tapping of pool water

Lightning strikes in the distance A faint flash inside

Jay stands alone in the center of the pool looking around at
the flickering shadows along the walls Vulnerable

EXT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 134
We see rain drops falling in an off-rhythm pattern against the
metal fence The doors to the building are visible in the

background

The rain begins to pour Picking up pace Rattling softly
into the wild grass along the edge of the building

We see various angles of increasing rainfall

134A OMITTED 134A
135 OMITTED 135
136 INT OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT 136

Jay waits alone in the pool - focused on the main entrance
Everyone is silent She listens to the sounds of rain and
the soft clatter of unseen machinery Air ducts and pool pumps
reverberate

Jay scans the doorways - turning lightly within the water
Watching Tense

Shadows flicker along the walls The reflections of water
against stone

The camera pans across the giant space The teenagers pose
like figures within a grander painting Positions have
shifted minimally

Kelly sits near the pool’s edge - leaning back on her hands -
palms flat against the cold and wet tile

Rain falls against one of the high windows - through which
outside light enters - creating descending drops of shadow
across the room

Paul leans against the side wall - watching - rubbing his
injured side casually over his t-shirt

Across the way Yara rests in one of the metal folding chairs
chewing on licorice - a foot tucked under a leg

Kelly looks to her sister alone in the pool as she turns and
pivots Seeing her older sister - afraid in this dark room -
Kelly tries to hold in her sadness

Positioned behind Kelly we watch Jay from a distance as she
stares into the emptiness - waiting for something to enter

JAY
(quietly)
Oh my God

Jay looks like shes about to cry She sees something
terrible although the area appears empty

JAY
It just walked into the room Its
right there

Jay points over to the entrance We see nothing

( )

136 136

PAUL
Its here

JAY
Right there

Jay points again Her voice pitches awkwardly She starts to
cry

Holding still we watch the scene from behind Kellys
shoulder

KELLY
Jay what do you see

Jay just stares ahead seeing something we do not

JAY
I don’t wanna tell you

PAUL
Jay I need you to point at it Keep
your finger aimed at it so we can see
where it is

In a single wide shot - Jay lifts her left hand and aims it
across the room - tracking the thing

PAUL
Is it getting into the water
JAY
No It’s just standing there - looking

at me
Kelly looks to Paul - concerned

PAUL
Ok um

JAY
It’s moving

Jay turns slowly her arm stretched out pointing at the

invisible thing - tracking with it around the far corner of
the pool
YARA
(frightened)

What’s it doing

JAY
Walking Walking closer

( ) 136

Jay continues to pivot in the water stepping back from the
edge nearest her invisible pursuer Creating distance

As Jay points along the pool’s side Yara steps back
cautiously bumping into some chairs - moving away from IT’s
path

JAY
Paul I wanna get out

PAUL
Just wait Give it a minute

JAY
No I don’t wanna do this I just
wanna get out of the water

Suddenly a metal folding-chair rises six feet in the air It
moves back and then flies into the pool with force - straight
at Jay

Splash

KELLY
Jay

Jay jumps to the side avoiding the chair as it sinks to the
bottom

Water swirls around us as we surface Jay splashes and lifts
her head for air She sees a NEARLY-NAKED MIDDLE-AGED MAN WITH
SALT AND PEPPER HAIR walking along the perimeter of the pool
He’s staring at her wearing nothing but underwear

The man grabs another chair and throws it at Jay She dives to
the side and dodges it Falling deeper into the water
Coughing and gasping

JAY

Help
Paul Kelly and Yara circle the pool reaching out for Jay -
waving for her to swim in their direction Screaming -
shouting
Jay rushes toward the edge It throws another chair at her -
striking her in the shoulder - causing her to fall below the
water

KELLY
No

Jay surfaces holding herself in pain

( ) 136
She sees the man pick up a small television - still connected
to the outlet by an extension cord He prepares to throw it -
offering her an odd smile

Jay braces herself for a shock covering her face from the
projectile The tv flies through the air - hurled recklessly

KELLY
Jayil

The tv misses Jay but splashes down nearby - pulling with it
the slack from the orange extension cord

The outside lights flicker but there are no sparks No smoke
Jay is ok

She looks back realizing she’s still alive and breathing

KELLY
You OK

JAY
Yeah

YARA

(smiling with relief)
It didn’t work

KELLY
Thank Godddd

PAUL
(to Jay))
Just keep pointing at it
Jay paddles pointing at the man while crying - trying to
catch her breath Yara and Kelly hover in the background
screaming and shouting for information

KELLY
Where is it

Paul clumsily pulls the pistol from his bag and runs in the
direction that Jay’s pointing He aims the gun along the edge
of the pool walkway We see no monsters No strange men

An old set of pink electric curlers fly into the water -
kicked by something unseen

SPLASH

Paul fires in the general direction of the curlers - taking a
guess

BANG

( ) 136

JAY
You missed it

PAUL
Where is it

For an instant we see IT from Jays POV The man stares at
her but swings his hand out at Paul reaching for him with a
violent shake and tremor

JAY
Watch out Dont get too close

The man throws another old appliance into the water straight
at Jay It misses her as the cord drops below the surface

Yara circles keeping her distance from the approaching IT
Paul moves back and tries to aim Once more we see things
from his POV Jay madly pointing her finger from within the

water

JAY
Its there

Paul fires again Across the pool the bullet slices into
Yaras leg

YARA
Ahhh

Yara falls onto the ground - unnoticed by everyone

JAY
No It missed

PAUL
Where Here Here

JAY
No Right there

Jay swings her hand trying to direct the weapon by proxy
Paul tries to slowly adjust the direction of his gun

The man grabs a household iron from the edge of the pool
Paul fires Yara screams in fright

BANG

Jay sees the shot connect with the man’s left thumb and index

finger - severing them The flesh flies off and drops into the
pool Blood spouts

( ) 136

Kelly pulls an old bed-sheet from her backpack Gaudy colors
swirling roses and a few large stains

She unfolds the sheet whipping it across the air As it
drifts down a stain is visible across the center

With his right hand the man hurls the iron into the water -
hitting Jay’s side below the surface She crumples

Paul tries to find a target

PAUL
Where is it

Moving along the pool’s edge Kelly flags the sheet outward
letting it drift It catches on something She lets go and
drops it down The sheet collects over the moving figure of a
man - revealing the thing walking amongst them A person under
an old worn sheet

Yara gasps at the sight of it - shuffling past her

Paul tries to steady his aim He fires at IT

BANG

Jay watches as a shot slices through the man’s head - covered
by the old sheet The bullet emerges from the other side
Blood sprays like vapor - constant and strong

The impact causes the man to stumble forward The geyser of
blood from his head tips with him He falls into the pool - no
emotion - no pain

SPLASH

The sheet spreads along the surface dropping down at the
edges - waterlogged

Jay quickly wades through the water toward Paul Kelly and
Yara - hands outstretched at the side of the pool

Almost there something pulls Jay below the surface

Underwater - a hand is grasped tightly around Jay’s ankle She
kicks and fights

Gasping for air there’s only water Jay thrashes and
struggles

Snaking extension cords - orange white and brown - lead down
into the depths of the water - anchored by small domestic
appliances - a toaster a television irons curlers and metal
chairs - dotting the bottom - littering the pool

( ) 136

Kelly and Paul’s POV - they watch as Jay is pulled deeper
underwater - kicking and fighting against nothing

Yara wails loudly nearby

Paul raises the gun toward the water

Jays POV - Jay continues to struggle underwater The man
holds her tightly by the ankle We watch from a distance the

debris of appliances and wires framing their fight

A bullet trail forms through the water zipping past Jay and
the man

Then another

A third trail strikes the man in the back releasing a large
swirl of blood He let’s go of Jay and she swims upward

Paul and Kelly pull Jay from the water dragging her onto the
ground Coughing and choking she crawls further along the
tile - in terrible pain

Her ankle is covered in a red rash

Jay sits soaking wet on the floor clutching her ankle - her
cast hangs limp to her side

A moment of silence Coughing and crying
Kelly holds tightly to Yaras bleeding leg
We hear the rain on the windows and some thunder claps above
Paul looks down into the clear pool water - seeing only the
extension cords and household objects We don’t see the IT nor
its blood
PAUL

Jay do you see it Is it still down

there
Jay peers over the edge
We watch from above as Jay stares down into the pool Instead
of water we see only deep red blood Everything below the
surface is obscured by the dense liquid
A pool of blood
As Jay stares in horror we hear a cacophony of sounds -

screeches and sirens - laughter and grunting - a birthing
scream - children yelling - her mother’s laughter

INT PAULS BASEMENT REC ROOM - NIGHT 140
A chair is propped against the door

Jay and Paul are laying on the couch - an old blanket covering
their bodies

Jay looks into his eyes and waits for a sign He nods his head
with love and anticipation

Jay moves on top of him - sitting up pulling the blanket over
herself They fumble underneath and begin to make love

Paul nervously touches her face Staring up lovingly
She kisses him - holding her cast to her side

They stare into each others eyes For the first time they are
thinking only of each other

A moment of connection through the physical Rain against the
basement window

They move slowly with pleasure

JAY
I feel like I’m hurting you

Paul looks up at her

PAUL
You’re not

Jay nods and continues

She pushes harder against him - exhaling - smiling down at
him

Paul stares at Jay’s face

We watch from across the room now The quiet basement A
thunderstorm outside The young lovers on an old couch

INT PAUL’S BASEMENT REC ROOM - NIGHT 140A

Wrapped in the blanket holding each other Jay and Paul rest
Faces close together Whispering

PAUL
Do you feel any different

Jay shakes her head No

JAY
Do you

PAUL
No

Jay kisses Paul
INT JAYS BEDROOM - NIGHT 137

Jay lays under her sheets - a cartoon bandaid across her
temple - a new cast on her arm Mrs Height sits on the edge
of the bed rubbing her back Softly

On the dresser we see a glass of wine and an old family
portrait Jay is a young girl Kelly is a baby Their
mother young and pretty smiles alongside Jays father a
middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair He grins happily
into the camera His smile is identical to the one he offered
Jay at the pool

INT PAULS CAR - DUSK 142

Paul drives through a run-down neighborhood within the inner
city He stares at a row of prostitutes Tight skirts
Revealing tops

They eye him Paul watches them as he passes The women
appear to move in slow motion

INT HOSPITAL - DAY 138

Jay sits across from Paul in Yara’s hospital room He lays
back in a chair - eyes closed and napping

Yara is eating in bed as she reads something from her phone

YARA

(reading with food in

her mouth)
When there is torture there is pain
and wounds physical agony and all
this distracts the mind from mental
suffering so that one is tormented
only by the wounds until the moment of
death

Yara pauses to take a sip of milk through a straw - noisily
she slurps

( )

YARA

(taking a bite of food)
The most terrible agony may not be in
the wounds themselves but in knowing
for certain that within an hour then
within ten minutes then within half a
minute now at this very instant -
your soul will leave your body and you
will no longer be a person and that
this is certain the worst thing is
that it is certain

Jay looks at Pauls handsome face She tilts her head a bit -
watching the young man at rest

Yara takes another large bite of food

INT OLD POOL BUILDING - DAY 141A

Several groups of inner-city children laugh and play in the
clean water of the old pool The rumble of the sound-track
suggests something ominous

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN 143
Beyond the barren trees of the middle-class suburban
neighborhood the concrete towers of a nuclear power plant are
visible in the distance Smoke rises

EXT PARK - NIGHT 144

Blue light from distant lamps shines a cold glow over the
empty park The trees are now barren

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 145

Dead but colorful leaves cover the ground We move forward
along the sidewalk

Up ahead a man rakes his front yard A few children build a
fort out of the fallen leaves Lines of red and orange across
the grass

Jay and Paul hold hands as they walk together through the
neighborhood The cast is gone

Far behind them a teenager in a coat marches slowly along the
edge of the road

Jay smiles to Paul and he smiles back They stare out at the
autumnal suburbia - pretty and clean
