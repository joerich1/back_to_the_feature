(There is) One God eternal—true
his name creative his personage
fearless with malice towards none
form beyond time and death unborn
self-emanated (can be realised by)
Guru’ grace Meditate (on Him)
Before time (started ticking) He was
“The Truth’ (Everlasting)

When (cycle of) Ages started He was
“The Truth Even now He is “The
Truth True O Nanak He Will
Ever Be (One) cannot achieve purity
(and hence piety of mind by simply)
washing (body) clean even hundred
thousand times By remaining mute
(ever moving mind) stills not
(even if body seemingly) poses deep
concentration Hunger (lust and
greed) of the hungry ceases not even
if loads of world’s (choicest gifts) are
tied to us and piled (around him)
In fact with meeting demands of
mind its craving goes on increasing
(One) may have a thousand nay a
kindred thousand worldly wisdoms
not even one will be of any avail (to
him in the divine court) How then
to become ‘Truthful’ and how veil of
falsehood torn (The answer is) by
submitting O Nanak to the Pre-
ordained Written Command of the
Lord of Will—God

Crowds throng the Ramlila ground where the triumph of good over evil the
triumph of Lord Rama over Demon Ravana are being celebrated There are
huge 100-feet effigies of the Demon Ravana his brother Kumbhakaran and
son Meghnad As faces young and old look up in wonder policemen led
by a British officer pretend to be tourists and await BANWARILALS signal

In the crowd disguised as a police officer CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD
checks the bullets in his Mauser pistol Then he spots BANWARILAL with

head is falling towards BANWARI The crowd breaks into a mighty roar and
moves back There is a wave in the sea of people which crashes into the police

Finding the perfect diversion AZAD dives into the crowd just before the
burning effigy falls on him The British officers chase him through the fields

AZAD manages to whisk away one of the motorcycles of the police The

I’m insane only about two things in
my life—Sonia and flying

DJ

(sings a Hindi film song drunkenly)
What is a mere heart Take my
life instead

ASLAM
Youre lucky to feel so passionately
about something

AJAY
You have your poetry

ASLAM
(sarcastically)
Just like DJ has his singing

AJAY
Everyone has
something they just have to find
this ‘thing’

passion for

SUE

Just like our revolutionaries Their
passion for freedom was greater
than their love for their own lives

KARAN

There’s nothing in this world worth
giving your life for Do you hear

So bright it could consume the sun
Cause Im face to face with the light

Whether I leave my mark

Whether I stay the path

Like a torch Im burning bright
Why must be keep bearing
