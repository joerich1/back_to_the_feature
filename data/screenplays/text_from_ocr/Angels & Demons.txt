INT HARVARD COLLEGE - NATATORIUM DAWN

The bottom of a swimming pool A lithe figure SLASHES
knife through the water doing laps

The swimmer is the only one in the pool but still pushes
hes got someone to beat His strokes echo off vacant
in an oldish college natatorium

As he reaches the end of the pool he sees a murky figure
the water The swimmer stops pulls off his goggles
ROBERT LANGDON is fiftyish but looks ten years younger
something to do with two hundred laps at dawn every day
CLAUDIO VINCENZO is heavier dressed in a sport jacket and
looks exhausted He speaks with an Italian accent

VINCENZO

LANGDON
Swim might help your jet lag

VINCENZO

Langdon gets out and pulls a towel off a nearby bench

another letter
(Vincenzo looks confused)
My request for access to the Archives

Vincenzo has no idea what hes talking about

LANGDON (contd)
Shouldnt you be in Rome Busy time
for you guys

VINCENZO
In fact I was in New York on
vacation I got a call in the
middle of the night --- find Robert
Langdon A matter of great urgency

LANGDON
Urgent Vatican business involving me
I doubt that

He heads for the locker room Vincenzo calls after

VINCENZO
They said to show you this
Langdon turns back Vincenzos holding a single sheet of
paper in

his right hand Langdon curious makes his way back to him

Takes the paper ---

--- and it is safe to say feels the earth give way beneath

his
feet He looks up eyes wide and mutters a single word
LANGDON
llluminati

EXT HARVARD CAMPUS DAWN

As the sun comes up Langdon and Vincenzo leave the
natatorium

VINCENZO
Yes of course but it couldnt be
the llluminati as we knew them they
disappeared a hundred years ago

LANGDON
Did they Look at the paper
VINCENZO
Ive seen it
LANGDON

Look again

Vincenzo looks at it The word llluminati is written in

ornate
script Vincenzo looks back up --- so
LANGDON (contd)
Turn it upside down
Vincenzo does Incredibly the word reads exactly the same
way

upside down

LANGDON (contd)
Its called an ambigram the same
backwards and forwards Thats common
in a symbol like a Jewish star or
yin-yang or a swastika but this is a
word People have searched for the
llluminati ambigrammatic symbol for
four centuries modern symbologists
even tried to create it but nobody
could pull it off not even by
computer Most had concluded it was a
myth I wrote a book about it
(REALIZING)
Which is why youre here isnt it

VINCENZO
The Art of the llluminati by Robert
Langdon
CUT TO
INT LANGDONS APARTMENT DAY
A hand skims along a bookcase and stops at that very title
a
heavy academic tome Langdon pulls it out and drops it on
the
desk in his apartment with a THUD
(The apartment is cluttered with esoterica the home of a
man
whose taste in furnishings was very fashionable about four
hundred

years ago A single man -- no kid stuff no cats)

Langdon flips the book open to an illustrated section in the

middle filled with renderings of previous attempts to
create the

symbol he now holds in his hand

LANGDON
Incredible Either someone just
figured out how to make this or they
found it Recently Which would

mean the llluminati have returned
(looks at Vincenzo)

An ancient brotherhood enemies of the

church surfacing just after the death

of a Pope Id pull you off

vacation too
VINCENZO
Its worse than just that Four
cardinals were kidnapped from their
quarters inside the Vatican some time
between three and five am this
morning Shortly afterward the Office
of the Swiss Guard received that
document along with the threat that
the Cardinals will be publicly
executed one per hour starting at
seven pm tonight in Rome

LANGDON
(mind racing ahead)
Conclave

VINCENZO
Was to begin today We have
postponed its start for a few hours a
story of illness there are no
suspicions Yet

LANGDON
What do you want from me

VINCENZO
The perpetrators of this heinous act
sent that -- ambigram you say -- as a
provocation a taunt But it may
also be their undoing If you can
help us learn their identity perhaps
we can stop them

LANGDON
Why me
VINCENZO
Your expertise Your erudition And

your involvement with recent Church --
shall we say mysteries

LANGDON
I wasnt under the impression that
episode had endeared me to the
Vatican

VINCENZO
amazed

Formidable Formidable A plane
is standing by twenty minutes from
here Will you come with me

Langdon doesnt move just stares at the ambigram still

VINCENZO (contd)

Professor Langdon you have spent ten
years of your academic life searching
for the very symbol you now hold in
your hand And the madman who
created it or who knows the secrets
of its origin-- that person is in Rome

How much longer must we pretend you
have not already decided to come

LANGDON (contd)

The llluminati didnt become violent
anti-Papists until the 17th century
Initially they were physicists
mathematicians astronomers Their
name means the Enlightened Ones In
the 1500s they started meeting
secretly to share their concerns about
the churchs inaccurate teachings

They were dedicated to the quest for

scientific truth And for that the
church -- to use your words -- hunted
them down and killed them Drove

them underground

Langdon turns and looks out the front window of the

Cardinal Mortati the Dean of the College who led the Popes

- STREET DAY
On the ground now and behind Vatican walls Langdon and
Vincenzo

walk briskly around a corner and are met by ERNESTO
OLIVETTI a

solidly-built man in his late thirties

OLIVETTI
Professor Langdon welcome to Vatican
City Ernesto Olivetti Inspector

Generale of the Vatican Police Force

He takes Langdon by the arm and gestures down a narrow
passageway

OLIVETTI (contd)
This way please well meet in the
headquarters of the Swiss Guard

LANGDON
I assumed you were Swiss Guard

OLIVETTI
No The Gendarmerie is responsible
for everything inside the Vatican
walls with the exception of the
security of His Holiness and the
Apostolic Palace That is Swiss
Guard The Commandante Generale of
the Roman Carbinieri has joined us as
well in an advisory capacity and
the Guarda Nacionale have sent a
representative

LANGDON
(CONFUSED)
So jurisdictionally this is-

OLIVETTI
A God damn nightmare

They turn a corner and approach a squat stone building

labeled
Offizia della Guarda Suiza
TWO SWISS GUARDSMEN are standing outside the entrance to the
building Theyre somewhat comically dressed in puffy
tunics

vertically striped in brilliant blue and gold with matching
pantaloons and spats topped by a black beret

Langdon cant completely hide a smile Olivetti notices
The

Guards raise their eight-foot swords allowing the three of
them

to enter the building

INT SWISS GUARD OFFICES - CORRIDOR DAY

The interior of the Swiss Guard offices is ornate and filled
with

artwork like every other Vatican building As they walk

Langdon studies the row of statues of male nudes that lines
both

sides of the hallway all wearing fig leaves

LANGDON
The Great Castration

OLIVETTI
I beg your pardon

LANGDON
1857 Pius IX felt the male form might
inspire lust so he got a hammer and
chisel and unmanned two hundred
statues These plaster fig leaves
were added later

Olivetti stops abruptly outside a heavy steel door with a
security keyguard beside it

OLIVETTI
Are you anti-Catholic Professor
Langdon

LANGDON

Me No Im anti-vandalism

OLIVETTI
I urge you to guard your tone in there
The Swiss Guard is a calling not a
profession and it encourages a certain
-- zealotry Commander Rocher the
head of the Guard is a deeply
spiritual man and he was close to the
late Pope Understood

LANGDON
(SINCERE)
I just hope I can help

OLIVETTI
So do I You were my idea

He enters a five-digit number on the keypad and the steel
doors
slide open

INT SWISS GUARD HEADQUARTERS DAY

The headquarters of the Swiss Guard is in a lushly adorned

Renaissance library crammed with sophisticated
communications and

surveillance equipment Its crowded Swiss Guard (in
suits and

ties the pantaloons are more for show) uniformed
Carbinieri and

Vatican Police crammed around different stations some
working

together others arguing mostly in Italian

OLIVETTI
Wait here

He crosses the room to a tall fair-haired man around sixty
weathered like steel -- maybe tempered is the better word

While they confer Langdon notices a woman to his left
We
recognize Vittoria Vetra the physicist we saw at CERN

She catches Langdons eye forces a grim smile recognizes
theyre

both strangers here Olivetti comes back with COMMANDER
ROCHER

the tall man very much in charge He speaks with a
FrenchSwiss

ACCENT -

ROCHER
(to Vittoria)
Ms Vetra Im Commander Rocher
Commandante Principale of the Swiss
Guard Thank you for coming And
Professor Langdon

LANGDON
Thats right Rocher looks him up and
down so youre Langdon

ROCHER
Thank God the symbologist is here
Ms Vetra this way please

He leads Vittoria across the room to a surveillance

monitor
Langdon puzzled by the cold shoulder looks at Olivetti
who
leans in
OLIVETTI
Theres been a development We
received another threat from the
kidnapper

Across the room they hear Vittoria GASP Olivetti goes to
join
them nodding to Langdon to follow
AT THE MONITOR
Langdon and Olivetti join Rocher and Vittoria and stare at
the

image on a video monitor -- its a familiar-looking
canister in
which a metallic drop of liquid shimmers in the middle

suspended
The acronym CERN is stenciled up its side On its base
is an
LED display counting down from about six hours
At the top of the monitor flashes superimposed text -- LIVE
FEED
CAMERA 86
VITTORIA
(CONTINUING)
-- canister was stolen from our lab
around midnight last night The

intruder killed my research partner
Leonardo Bentivoglio and mutilated
him in order to bypass security

They look at her dont quite see the connection

VITTORIA (contd)
We use retinal scanners
(they still dont get it)
They cut out his eyes

They cringe

VITTORIA (contd)
That canister contains an extremely
combustible substance called
antimatter We need to locate it
immediately or evacuate Vatican City

ROCHER
Im quite familiar with incendiaries
Ms Vetra I havent heard of
antimatter

VITTORIA

Its new energy research technology
It uses a reverse polarity vacuum to
filter out anti-matter positrons
generated in particle accelerations in
the Large Hadron Collider at CERN

They look at her blankly She points at the screen

VITTORIA (contd)
The anti-matter is suspended there
in an airtight nanocomposite shell
with electromagnets at each end But
if it were to fall out of suspension
and come into contact with matter --
say the bottom of the canister -- the
two opposing forces will annihilate
one another Violently

ROCHER
And what might cause it to fall out of
suspension

VITTORIA
The battery going dead Which it
will

(looks at the screen)
In six hours and eleven minutes

Silence for a moment

OLIVETTI

That could be anywhere inside the
Vatican walls

VITTORIA
Youve got to find it

ROCHER
Were a bit preoccupied with four
missing cardinals at the moment

VITTORIA
You dont understand An
annihilation is a cataclysmic event
It would be a blinding explosion
equivalent to about five megatons
The blast radius alone would be --

peaks up from behind her

LANGDON
Vatican City will be consumed by
light

still They turn and look at him

ROCHER
Those are the exact words the
kidnapper used

OFFICE DAY

er theyre crowded around the

s desk where a dimly-lit video recording

computer screen (The office is behind

side of the headquarters)

recording are of FOUR OLDER MEN some in
sixties the others in their seventies filmed in dim light

behind

bars in a dank dungeon-like space

A lightly accented VOICE speaks from behind the camera

Rocher does

VOICE (0S)
We will destroy your four pillars
brand your preferiti and sacrifice
them on the altars of science and
then bring your church down upon you
Vatican City will be consumed by
light

LANGDON
Its an ancient llluminati threat
(Rocher pauses the recording)
The destruction of Vatican City

through light The four pillars --
he probably means the kidnapped
cardinals You didnt mention they

were the preferiti

(to Vittoria)
The favorites to be chosen as the new
Pope Play it again

VOICE (0S)
We will destroy your four pillars
brand your preferiti and sacrifice
them on the altars of science

LANGDON
Stop it there

LANGDON (contd)
Brand them another llluminati
legend this one says there are a set
of five brands each one an ambigram
(MORE)

LANGDON (contd)
The first four are the fundamental

elements of science -- earth air
fire water The fifth -- isa
mystery Maybe its this

He pulls the llluminati ambigram from his pocket

ROCHER
away

there is

He said theyd be killed publicly In
churches

LANGDON
(nods not surprised)
Revenge for La Purga

ROCHER
La Purga
LANGDON
Dont you guys read your own history
1668 The church kidnapped four

llluminati scientists and branded
their chests with the symbol of the
cross To purge their sins
Murdered them and left their bodies in
the street as a warning to others to
stop questioning church rulings on

scientific matters It was after La
Purga that a darker more violent
llluminati emerged This sounds

like retribution
(to Rocher)
Is there any more

Rocher hits play again
VOICE (0S)
and then bring your church down
upon you Vatican City will be
consumed by light

While listening this time Langdon notices a darkened video
monitor inlaid at an angle on Rochers desk It faces

from the outer office and instead of an onoff switch
an oddly-shaped keyhole
VOICE (0S) (contd)
A shining star at the end of the Path
of Illumination

Langdon looks up sharply

LANGDON
The Path of Illumination
Rocher stops the video

LANGDON (contd)
I need to get into the Vatican
Archives

Rocher shakes his head looks at Olivetti harshly is
embarrassed

OLIVETTI
Professor this is not the appropriate
moment to-

ROCHER
Your petition has been denied seven
times Mr Langdon

LANGDON

This has nothing to do with that

(FAST)
The Path of Illumination is an ancient
trail through Rome that leads to the
Church of the Illumination a secret
place where llluminati members could
meet in safety If I can find the
Segno the sign that marks the start
of the Path Im willing to bet the
four churches along it are where he
intends to murder your cardinals If
we can get to one of them before he
does we can stop it But to find
the start of the path I need to get
into the Archives

ROCHER
Even if I wanted to help you access
is only by written decree of the
curator and the Board of Vatican
Librarians

LANGDON
Or by papal mandate

ROCHER
Yes But as youve no doubt heard
the Holy Father is-

LANGDON
What about Il Camerlengo Let me
talk to him

ROCHER
The Camerlengo Hes just a priest
here the former Popes Chamberlain

LANGDON

Doesnt the power of the Holy See rest
with him during tempe sede vacante

They just stare at him Shit this guys good Langdon
checks his
watch getting irritated
LANGDON (contd)
Hey fellas --- you called me

CUT TO

INT PAPAL OFFICES DAY

A spectacular view of St Peters Square through the
windows of

the Papal offices Moving down we find a figure dressed
ina
simple black cassock his back to us staring out at the
crowd
FATHER SEBASTIAN GUTTIEREZ the Camerlengo speaks with a
soft
Spanish accent
CAMERLENGO
His Holiness once told me that a Pope
is a man torn between two worlds
the real world and the divine
Assembled in the grand office are Langdon Rocher Olivetti
and

Vittoria The Camerlengos back is still turned

CAMERLENGO (contd)
He warned that any church that ignored
reality would not survive to enjoy the
divine

He turns around Hes younger than we thought in his
mid-
thirties deep dark eyes The kind of priest who often
inspires before the years of dogma catch up with him

CAMERLENGO (contd)

It seems the real world is upon us
tonight

(to Langdon)
Im familiar with llluminati lore and
the legend of the brandings La
Purga is a dark stain on the churchs
history Im not surprised this ghost
has come back to haunt us

He sits behind the massive desk and if he seemed young
before he

seems like a child now overcome by the position hes in
But

when he speaks to Rocher hes in command

CAMERLENGO (contd)
Commandante have you begun a search
for this explosive device

ROCHER
Of course but it could be anywhere
and the safety of the cardinals is my
primary concern at the moment

CAMERLENGO
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress as
long as the cardinals are in conclave
your security concerns are at a
minimum Devote as much of your
resources as possible to a search for-

ROCHER
Signore if youre about to suggest
we make a naked-eye search of all of
Vatican City I must-

CAMERLENGO
(SHARPLY)
Commander Though I am not His
Holiness when you address me you are
addressing this office Do you
understand

ROCHER
damn good

face her

his

Yes Padre

CAMERLENGO
Good Now -- you said the image on
screen was illuminated by artificial
light May I suggest methodically
cutting the power to various sections
of the City When the image on your

screen goes dark youll have a more
specific idea of the devices
location

Rocher looks at Olivetti -- gotta admit thats a pretty
idea

CAMERLENGO (contd)
Ms Vetra Besides yourself and
your research partner who knew about
your antimatter project

VITTORIA
Only the director of CERN But
Leonardo kept detailed journals if he
told anyone else about what we were
doing he would have made a note of
it

CAMERLENGO
(PAUSE)
Do you have these journals

VITTORIA
I can have them flown here from Geneva
in an hour

He pauses thinking then turns the phone on his desk to
While she picks it up to dial the Camerlengo comes around
desk to speak privately to Langdon
CAMERLENGO
Mr Langdon Youre correct that I

may grant you access to the Archives

LANGDON
Thank you Padre
good

in

CAMERLENGO
I said youre correct that I may not
that I will Christianitys most
sacred codices are in that archive
Given your recent entanglement with
the church -- I need to ask you a
question first

Langdon looks at him -- fire away

The Camerlengo loo

The Camerlengo loo

answer He puts

CAMERLENGO (contd)
Do you believe in God sir

LANGDON
(DELICATELY)
Father I simply believe that
religions can often-

CAMERLENGO
I didnt ask if you believe what man
says about God I asked if you believe
in God

LANGDON
Im an academic My mind tells me I
will never understand God

CAMERLENGO
And your heart

LANGDON
Tells me Im not meant to

s at him -- thats not quite good enough

LANGDON (contd)
believe that faith is a gift which
have not been fortunate enough to
receive

CAMERLENGO
Be delicate with our treasures

EXT APOSTOLIC PALACE DAY

The back doors of the Apostolic Palace BANG open and Langdon
is

ushered out (fast) by Olivetti the head of the Vatican
Police

OLIVETTI
The archives are this way

They turn down a narrow passageway A VOICE calls from
behind
them

VITTORIA (0S)
Professor Langdon

Vittoria catches up to them

VITTORIA (contd)
If this path really leads to the
Church of Illumination that may be
where theyve hidden the antimatter

LANGDON
A shining star at the end of the
Path My thoughts exactly

OLIVETTI
(to Vittoria)
If we find this bomb can you
deactivate it

VITTORIA
No but I can change its battery as
long as it has more than five minutes
of life That would give us another
twenty-four hours to get it back to
CERN

Olivetti nods to her come on along They walk again holds
a hand
out to Langdon
VITTORIA (contd)
Vittoria Vetra Are you really a
symbologist or was he mocking you

LANGDON
Both Youre a physicist

VITTORIA
(NODS)
Bio-entanglement physics
Interconnectivity of life systems

LANGDON
Okay

VITTORIA
What are we looking for in the
archives

LANGDON
A little book written by Galileo

VITTORIA
Galileo was llluminati

LANGDON

And a devout Catholic He thought
science and religion werent enemies
but two different languages telling
the same story He wanted like
minds to be able to find the Church of
Illumination but he couldnt exactly
advertise its location so he created
a coded path An unknown llluminati
master sculpted four statues each a
tribute to one of the four fundamental

elements -- earth air fire water --
and put them out in public in
churches throughout Rome Each

statue held a clue pointing to the
next And at the end of the trail was
the Church of Illumination

Vicenzo leading them turns up Via Sentinel and starts up
the
hill toward the Archives They follow quickly

OLIVETTI
What makes you think hes going to
murder the cardinals in the churches

LANGDON
The llluminati called those four
churches by a special name -- LAltare
di scienza The altars of science
VITTORIA
(making the
CONNECTION)
Sacrifice them on the altars of
science he said
Langdon stops in his tracks
LANGDON

Oh Oh wow

Hes staring up at the impressive facade of the Vatican
Archives

He takes a deep breath then steps forward to enter But

Vincenzo doesnt follow Langdon looks at him

LANGDON (contd)
We go in alone

OLIVETTI
Vatican Police arent allowed access
to the archives only Swiss Guard Lt
Chartrand will meet you inside Ill
be here when youre done

Langdon turns back to the Archives with a look of deep
contentment
-- hes wanted in here for a long long time

And steps through the double doors

CuT TO
INT APOSTOLIC PALACE DAY

The Camerlengo walks briskly through the hallways of the
Apostolic

Palace deep in thought He reaches the top of the Royal

Staircase and can hear the RUMBLING of activity in the
Sistine

Chapel below

Looking down the stairs he sees the doorway open and the
gathering of cardinals inside As he reaches the base of
the

stairs Cardinal Mortati who has been summoned steps
outside to

meet him flanked by his aide Father Simeon

Vincenzo leading them turns up Via Sentinel and starts up
the
hill toward the Archives They follow quickly

They speak in English their common language

CAMERLENGO
Youve been informed of the new
situation

MORTATI
(NODS)
May Gods mercy be upon us

CAMERLENGO
And the other cardinals

MORTATI
Await your word

The Camerlengo thinks feels the weight of this decision on
his
young shoulders

CAMERLENGO
May I ask your guidance Padre

MORTATI
My belief is we should proceed with
the sealing of conclave

CAMERLENGO
At this hour That would be highly
unorthodox

MORTATI
And yet within church law Its in
my power Ive been chosen Great
Elector

CAMERLENGO
The cruelest honor in Christendom
MORTATI
The only ambitions I have are for my

church St Peters church which
is under attack at its most vulnerable
moment This is not a coincidence

Is it possible our enemies hope to
distract us from our sacred task

CAMERLENGO
The church will not fall in a day We
may be wise to consider evacuation

MORTATI
That is exactly what they want
publicity and panic We must not

give them oxygen for the media fire

CAMERLENGO
What of the safety of the cardinals

MORTATI
Surely there is not an elector present
who values his physical being more
than the unbroken leadership of the
Holy See

CAMERLENGO
And the people in St Peters Square

MORTATI
They care as deeply about their church
as we do Their faith will sustain
them

CAMERLENGO

But if their faith does not protect
them from an explosion

MORTATI
Were all bound for heaven eventually
are we not

CAMERLENGO
Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
blessings of a long and full life

Mortati bristles at the thinly-veiled insult
MORTATI
Signore do not confuse the power of
the office you temporarily hold with
your true place here in the Vatican
You were a favorite of His Holiness
but His Holiness is with his Father
now

CAMERLENGO
Mea culpa

Satisfied Mortati looks back over his shoulder at the

anxious

faces in the Chapel Then turns back to the Camerlengo

MORTATI
Seal the doors

With a heavy THUD the huge doors close and bolts SLAM into
place

An ancient key GRINDS in an ornate lock two heavy chains
RATTLE

doors

and at that very moment --

INT VATICAN ARCHIVES DAY

-- two huge modern glass doors WHOOSH open revealing what
looks

like a 23rd century library Its a massive underground
space

like a darkened airplane hangar with a dozen glass boxes
evenly

spaced throughout Theyre lit up from within each
containing

row upon row of bookshelves neatly filled with books
papers and
arcana

LT CHARTRAND a twenty-five year old member of the Swiss
Guard

(in a suit and earpiece not the traditional garb) leads
Langdon

and Vittoria toward the glass enclosures

CHARTRAND
(Swiss accent)
The chambers are hermetic vaults
oxygen is kept at lowest possible
levels Its a partial vacuum
inside More than ten minutes in the
vault is not recommended without
breathing apparatus

He stops at one particular chamber and gestures to the sign
on its

door -- Il Processo Galileano

CHARTRAND (contd)
Ill be just outside the door

Langdon starts toward the entrance to the vault but
Chartrand
puts a hand on his chest stopping him

CHARTRAND (contd)
Watching you Mr Langdon

Langdon looks at him Hes not popular around here

INT GALILEO VAULT DAY

The electronic revolving door spins and admits Langdon to

the

interior of the vault He takes a deep breath holds it and
lets

it out

Vittoria follows shortly behind him and shes unprepared --
the

lack of oxygen hits her hard she dizzies

LANGDON
Take a moment If you feel double
vision double over

VITTORIA
(bends over)
Feels like Im scuba diving with
the wrong mixture

LANGDON
Plenty of time
He checks his watch Its 707

LANGDON (contd)

Uh actually I take that back

INT A DARK SPACE DAY

In a dark space a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a
cup of

hot water An elegant man in his forties dressed ina
casual

suit no tie HUMS softly to himself as he steeps his tea
No

idea of his name but his suit is gray so how about MR
GRAY

The tea is on an old wooden table being heated by a small
can of

sterno While Mr Gray bobs the tea bag he stares at
something

to his right

Money A lot of it in a number of different
denominations

neatly segmented in a briefcase And three passports all

different colors (and nationalities) neatly placed on top
of it

Satisfied Mr Gray CLICKS the briefcase shut and slides it
under

the table tucking it up against the wall He removes the
cup

from the heat still bobbing the tea bag

He walks lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on
strange

walls He heads down a very dark hallway past a row of

stonewalled cells and within each is the dimly lit figure
of the

older men we saw on the videotape earlier -- the kidnapped

cardinals

He stops at the last cell where the man CARDINAL LAMASSE
looks

up at him from the wooden bench hes sitting on

MR GRAY
You have no idea what youre missing
LAMASSE
Conclave will go on without us The
voice of God will not be silenced

MR GRAY
I was referring to my tea Last
chance Id be happy to make you a
cup

LAMASSE
May God forgive you for what youve
done

MR GRAY
Father if God has issues they wont
be with what Ive done --
(seems genuinely saddened)
-- but with what Im about to do

A MOMENT LATER

Mr Grays hand takes the burning tin of sterno and tosses

it into

a fireplace where the liquid fire consumes a pile of dry

kindling He picks up something else and places it in the
heart

of the flames

A long-handled iron rod

I realized what was in it

The number 503 I kept seeing it over
and over in llluminati letters scribbled
in the margins or sometimes just signed
that way 503 Its a numerical
clue but to what Five of course is

Langdon now wearing white cotton gloves sets the tiny
manuscript
on a viewing stand

LANGDON

VITTORIA
Langdon

There are

I know about Dialogo and Discorsi --
Galileo laid out his theories about
the earth revolving around the sun
and the church forced him to recant
But what was this

LANGDON
This is where he got the word out The
truth not what the Vatican forced him
to write Smuggled out of Rome and
printed in Holland on sedge papyrus
That way any scientists caught with a
copy could simply drop it in water and
the booklet would dissolve

Carefully he turns the first page

LANGDON (contd)
Between its delicate nature and the
Vatican burnings its said this is
the only copy that remains
(turns the second page)

revealed

But who is Santi

LANGDON

VITTORIA
Raphael The sculptor

LANGDON
Santi was his last name

VITTORIA
So the path starts at Raphaels tomb

LANGDON
(not entirely
CONVINCED)
Yeah

OLIVETTI
Raphael is buried at the Pantheon

VITTORIA
Is the Pantheon even a church

OLIVETTI

RADIO)
Oldest Catholic church in Rome

Langdon has fallen silent but it all makes perfect sense

so he

says nothing as Olivetti cranks the wheel hard --

opposite

direction headed for the Pantheon
CUT TO

EXT PANTHEON - SIDE STREET DAY

The police car pulls to a stop as quietly as possible
across an
open plaza from the Pantheon
Two black Alfa-Romeos with tinted windows glide to a stop
on

either side of them As Langdon and the others get out

Commander Rocher and THREE MORE SWISS GUARD all in black
suits

surround them Rocher goes straight to Langdon highly
skeptical

ROCHER
Ive just pulled a dozen of my best
men from Vatican City during conclave
and left the search for the antimatter
device in the hands of secondary
officers Youd better be right

LANGDON
I believe I am

ROCHER
The Pantheon is one of the busiest
tourist spots in Rome how could he
hope to get away with it Its
impossible

LANGDON
As impossible as kidnapping four
cardinals from Vatican City The
poem is precise

Olivetti catches eyes with Langdon whos still clutching
the page

pulled from the Diagramma He slips it quietly into his
jacket

pocket

ROCHER
The poem Unbelievable Im
basing this operation on an Americans
interpretation of a four hundred year
old poem

VITTORIA
The information we have clearly refers
to Raphaels tomb and Raphaels tomb
is inside that building

She points to the Pantheon its edifice shimmering in the
early
to

evening light

LANGDON
The Pantheon is your one chance to
catch this guy

ROCHER
One I thought you said four A
pathway four markers Well have
four chances to catch him

LANGDON
You would have a hundred years ago
The Vatican had all the pagan statues
in the Pantheon removed and destroyed

in the late 1800s

Whatever marker

was there to lead us to the next

church is gone now

The path is

dead This is your chance

Rocher looks at him for a long moment

UNIFORMED OFFICER

then turns abruptly

ROCHER
Separate approaches Cars to Piazza
della Rotunda Via degli Orfani
Piazza SantIgnazio and
SantlEustachio No closer than two
blocks no uniforms three minutes

The Officer salutes and they snap into action

ROCHER (contd)
And I need a set of eyes inside

Two BEEFY GUARDSMEN in black suits step forward

VITTORIA
Wait a minute youll scare him off

ROCHER
Theyre not in uniform

VITTORIA
Im sorry two weightlifters in
matching black suits and earpieces
theyre hardly disguised

ROCHER
Theres no time to get undercover men
here

Fine Ill go

ROCHER

Im not sending a wom-
Her arched eyebrow stops his sentence in its tracks

ROCHER (contd)
-- a civilian into this situation You
have no communications and you cant
carry a walkie-talkie its too
conspicuous

VITTORIA
Tourists have cell phones dont they
(pulls out her own and
holds it to her ear)
Hi honey Im at the Pantheon you
should see this place

Rocher seems to be thinking about it Langdon
looks at her his
protective instincts aroused
LANGDON

You cant send her in there alone

ROCHER
I dont intend to

EXT PANTHEON - TWO MINUTES LATER

CLOSE ON a pair of hands linked Vittoria and Langdon
holding

hands like lovers walk slowly toward the entrance to the

Pantheon A COUPLE DOZEN TOURISTS blissfully unaware mill
about

the square while up on the rooftops SNIPERS have them in
view
Langdon looks around this wasnt what he had in mind
Vittoria

glances at him amused

VITTORIA
Youre crushing my hand

LANGDON
Im sorry

VITTORIA

unsupported span even larger than the cupola of St Peters

are a DOZEN TOURISTS scattered around and a TOUR GROUP on
side hearing a lecture from a MUSEUM DOCENT
Langdon looks up at the hole in the ceiling through which a
shaft of light is shining
LANGDON

The oculus That could be the

demons hole in the poem
Looking around Vittoria sees several sarcophagi scattered
the room all pointing obliquely in a certain direction As

move stealthily through the crowd they speak in low tones

VITTORIA
Why are the tombs at an angle

LANGDON
To face east Sun worship

VITTORIA
But this is a Christian church

LANGDON

(SHRUGS)
New religions often adopt existing
holidays to make conversion less
shocking December 25th was the pagan
holiday of the Unconquered Sun Made
it a handy choice for Christs
birthday

VITTORIA
Youre saying Christianity is
repackaged sun worship

LANGDON
Where do you think halos came from
Not just sun worship though the
Catholics borrowed Communion from the
Aztecs canonization from Euphemerus
the cruciform from the Egyptians ---

VITTORIA
No wonder they dont like you around
here

LANGDON
Just trying to keep the conversation
lively
(POINTS)
Check the recesses Ill go left
See you in a hundred eighty degrees

He starts to the left she goes to the right walking in the
shadowy recesses behind the pillars at the edges of the

room

Langdon walks slowly checking out faces Tourists
Couples

Teenagers More tourists

Around every column there are shadows and in those shadows

--- nothing

He looks at his watch Five minutes to eight And
then --

--- a SHRIEK from the other side of the room He

whirls sees
Vittoria backing away from something

LANGDON (contd)

He races across the room reaches her at the far side Her

ashen Shes pointing at something aghast

VITTORIA
Raphaels tomb But --

Langdon rushes forward to the crypt There doesnt seem to
anything out of the ordinary except ---

VITTORIA (contd)
--- its the wrong one

LANGDON
What are you talking about

He leans down looks at the plaque on it

VITTORIA
He was moved here in 1759 A century
after Diagramma was published

LANGDON
Thats not possible the poem said-

VITTORIA
Where was he originally buried

LANGDON
I dont know Urbino I think
(thinking like crazy)
Santis earthly tomb what else
could it possibly Santi s tomb

His eyes flit around the room from one ornate sarcophagus
another And then it hits him

LANGDON (contd)
Damn it Santis tomb must mean
one of the chapels he built Hes
not buried in it he designed it Rich
people commissioned burial chapels in
churches all over Rome in his day
(looks up)
And the demons hole it isnt the
oculus its an undercroft a crypt
common sixteenth century term

At that very moment the tour group is passing them and the
elderly Docent asks his group the perfunctory wrap-up

DOCENT
Does anyone have any questions

Langdon busts in on the group

LANGDON
Yes Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary annex and
angel figure commissioned by the
Catholic Church

The Docent blinks Wasnt expecting quite so esoteric a
question

LANGDON (contd)

Well

DOCENT
Im sorry I I can only think of
one

Langdon suppresses the urge to grab him by the lapels and

shake it

out of him

They scurry away as Langdon comes around the front and we
back to see what he sees
Its Cardinal Lamasse
Hes been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his

his jaw broken his mouth crammed full of dirt

But thats not the worst of it Langdon GAGS as he sees

blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of

Cardinals chest Its an ambigram like weve seen

but

this time it says --

Cardinal Mortati sits regally at the main altar at the front

and

I call as my witness Christ the Lord

who will be my judge that my vote is

given to the one who before God I

The African Cardinal stands holds his ballot over his head
lowers the ballot to the altar where a plate sits atop a
chalice

He places the ballot on the plate then picks up the plate

uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice He then

replaces the

votes He shakes it chooses one---
MORTATI

Eligo in summum pontificem --
-- and reads an unfamiliar name
He makes a note in a ledger then raises a threaded needle

pierces the ballot through the word Eligo sliding the
the thread
A SHORT TIME LATER ANOTHER DISSOLVE

and there are a hundred and sixty-one ballots on the thread
Mortati looks up from his ledger and speaks to the room

MORTATI
The first ballot has failed

He takes He thread carrying all the ballots and ties the

A DOOR OPENS
on a small incinerator The ring of ballots is hurled inside
bursts immediately into flame

A dark brackish smoke billows up from the burning ballots
follow the smoke up up into the chimney --

EXT ST PETERS SQUARE DUSK

--- and to the roof of the Sistine Chapel where the black
puffs out into the early evening sky

Below a CROWD OF THOUSANDS GROANS in disappointment as the
message is sent --- no new pope yet

But while they are all watching the smoke we turn our

to the opposite direction to the east across Rome to

EXT PIAZZA DEL POPOLO DUSK

--- those black Alfa Romeos four this time glide silently
halt outside the church where Langdon just found the corpse
Guard in black suits pour out of the vehicles and hurry into
church trying to attract as little attention as possible
INT SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO DUSK

The inside of the church is being sealed off as a crime
Rocher just arriving takes charge as the plastic is RIPPED

ROCHER
Get that body out of there and search
the rest of the building

Swiss Guardsmen drop into the demons hole to remove the
body

ROCHER (contd)
(to another Guardsman)
Outside -- a perimeter Secure but
invisible No lights no guns no
one knows Understood

Langdon lost in thought drifts through the small chapel
studying
the intricate carvings and other artwork

LANGDON
Earthly symbology everywhere

Rocher passes through his field of vision livid

ROCHER
Why the hell didnt you figure this
out in the first place

It was more a rhetorical question but Langdon answers
honestly
still lost in thought his voice soft

LANGDON
I made a mistake

He drifts toward a statue of the highest quality white
marble

resting in a niche on the far side out of the way of the
mayhem

Vittoria joins him

VITTORIA
Is it Raphael
LANGDON
The chapel is But the sculptures
are Bernini
(STUNNED)

The unknown Illuminati master was
Bernini
VITTORIA
Didnt he work for the Church

LANGDON
Almost exclusively It means the
Tlluminati even infiltrated the
Vatican They hid in plain sight

He steps closer to the statue Its of two life-size
human

figures intertwined one a regal bearded man the other a

cherub floating overhead

LANGDON (contd)
Habakkuk and the Angel

VITTORIA
Habakkuk

LANGDON

The prophet who predicted the
annihilation of the earth This is
the first marker

He steps closer studying it carefully

LANGDON (contd)
Let angels guide you on your lofty
quest

His eyes move slowly over the statue and ours do too from
the

angels innocent face down his arm and to his right hand

is outstretched one finger extended --

Langdon dashes down the stairs outside the church and into

LANGDON
Southwest it points southwest

He gets his bearings looks to the southwest sees nothing
buildings in the way
He runs back up the church steps where Vittoria and Rocher
just coming outside Langdons mind is racing
LANGDON (contd)

Earth-air-fire-water were looking

for a Bernini sculpture having

something to do with air

(to Rocher)
And the next church is southwest of

here

ROCHER
Youre sure this time

LANGDON
I need a map One that shows all
the churches in Rome

Rocher just stares at him studying him

LANGDON (contd)
I could use it now

Rocher starts down the steps toward his car

LANGDON (contd)
And a compass

He looks around sees the rickety scaffolding outside the
and ---

A MOMENT LATER
--- he climbs into our view now on the scaffolding
Hes moving

upward fast toward ---

EXT CHURCH ROOF DUSK

--- the roof of the old church also undergoing renovation

The

view of Rome is spectacular from up here and Langdon rushes
to

the western wall looking intently off in that direction

He sees something that makes him suck in his breath hears a
voice

from behind him ---

VITTORIA (OS)
Robert

--- and turns as Vittoria tosses something small and black
up to

him

A compass He catches it holds it steady and walks
toward the

edge of the roof as the compass needle swivels and settles
on SW

Langdon looks up following the line of the needle up over
the

rooftops of Rome to a massive structure in the distance
exactly

in line with the compass needle

square from
atop the oval colonnades

SHARPSHOOTERS scurry among the statuary setting themselves
up

They move through the crowd pushing people aside causing a
of a ruckus as they try to uncover the elaborate carvings in
stone of the square
(IF WE ARE EAGLE-EYED at this point we will see TWO ROBED
one helping the other who carries a cross as they pass
the crowd behind Langdon)

Remembering something Langdon rushes forward toward the

of the square uncharacteristically brusque with the crowd
shoving his way through now

He draws close to one carving in particular slows to a

INT PAPAL OFFICE NIGHT

-- the papal office where the Camerlengo Rocher Olivetti
and

Vittoria are gathered again as are HALF A DOZEN other
security

officers Its crowded busy little knots of
jurisdictional

arguments and competing theories around the room

The Camerlengo at his desk is stunned speaking to
Olivetti

Langdon edges close enough to hear but not too close

CAMERLENGO
When did this call come in

OLIVETTI
Three four minutes ago The same
voice as on the tape Were

analyzing the accent now Alsatian is
our best guess at the moment

CAMERLENGO
And he actually claimed responsibility
for the death of His Holiness

OLIVETTI
Not personally but he said it was the
Illuminati He said they murdered
him

CAMERLENGO
Thats ridiculous the Holy Father
died of a stroke Did he say how
they claim to have done it

OLIVETTI
The Popes own medication A drug
known as Heparin

There is silence for a moment Rocher looks up
Looks away

VITTORIA
The Pope took Heparin

CAMERLENGO
He had thrombophlebitis He took an
injection once a day But no one
knew that
OLIVETTI
Someone knew

ROCHER

His Holiness had health concerns he
was subject to seizures as well But
he took steps to make sure he was --
watched For safety Thats all
he wished to be made public and
thats all we should discuss
VITTORIA

(ignoring him)
Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage
An overdose would cause massive
internal bleeding and brain
hemorrhages At first it might look
like a stroke but in a few days his
body would show signs we could easily-

Rocher spins on her livid

ROCHER
Ms Vetra in case youre unaware
papal autopsies are prohibited by
Vatican Law We are not about to
defile His Holinesss body just
because his enemies claim to-

CAMERLENGO
Of course were not Well make a
public announcement refuting this
absurd claim

Father Simeon Cardinal Mortatis aide steps forward

FR SIMEON
Im afraid thats out of the question
Cardinal Mortati has insisted this
entire matter be kept internal

CAMERLENGO
Cardinal Mortati shouldnt even be
aware of this hes locked in
conclave

FR SIMEON
His final instructions before sealing
the doors were very clear -- no outside
communications unless absolutely
necessary

CAMERLENGO
Cardinal Mortati will remember that he
is Dean of the College of Cardinals
not His Holiness himself

FR SIMEON
As you say Yet technically now that
Conclave has begun it is his
privilege and duty to control public
announcements Ive drafted a short
release about the incident in the
square but any other statements are
specifically prohibited For that the
Cardinal has asked me to remind you --
we have a chimney

The Camerlengo just stares at him a power struggle Which
he is
going to lose

CAMERLENGO
As you say
(turns away)
Commander Rocher the search for the
device

ROCHER
Weve turned the power off and on to
about twenty percent of Vatican City
Nothing on the video yet

CAMERLENGO
Mr Langdon youve been right so far
if belatedly about the Path Its now
nine fifteen how quickly can you find
the next church

Langdon refers to a map spread out on the desk

LANGDON
The line of the breath in the carving
points due east directly away from
Vatican City but there are five
lines so theres room for error

While he talks an AIDE in a business suit is ushered
quietly in

the door by a Swiss Guardsman Hes carrying a satchel

Vittoria recognizes him and he goes to her

LANGDON (contd)
There are about twenty churches that
intersect it None of their names
invoke fire but there must be a
Bernini sculpture inside one of them
that does Im going to need to get
back into the Archives to find it

CAMERLENGO
(to Olivetti)
Escort him

Langdon looks to Vittoria -- you coming She looks up from a
table

where shes opened the satchel brought in by the Aide She
holds

two leather-bound books in her hand

VITTORIA
The journals I asked for Id like
to stay here and study them If
Leonardo told anyone else about our
project that could be the killer

CAMERLENGO
Fine

The group starts to break up half of them headed for the
doors

As Langdon rolls up the map on the desk the Camerlengo
notices

his black clothes for the first time

CAMERLENGO (contd)
Professor would it surprise you to
find those clothes suit you

Langdon manages a sliver of a smile starting to like this
guy

LANGDON
It would surprise the hell out of me

Langdon blinks his vision becoming seriously impaired He

his eyes closed for a moment opens them its not much

Langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the
vault Then
at the row of bookcases Gets an idea

He goes to the last bookcase which is about six feet from

the

glass wall He hoists himself up on the shelf of the
bookcase

opposite it wedges himself in

And pushes with one leg The giant bookcase teeters
but just

barely

Langdon hoists himself further up gets both legs up against
the

bookshelf

Pushes again -- more movement this time

Now he puts everything he has into it straining like hell
The

bookcase starts to tip goes just past the point of no
return

starts to fall gloriously headed straight for the glass
wall

which it SLAMS into with enormous power and --

the trigger Nothing happens Trigger doesnt even

After a moment of oxygen-poor thinking he figures out how

CLICK off the safety Tries again

(Pow )

The sound of the shot is barely audible to Langdon His
going fast

If he was hoping to bring the whole wall down he failed
theres a faint HISSING sound coming from the bullethole
goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside
He stands back his brain clearing momentarily

Seized by an idea he looks up at the wall at its four

and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he
made in the center

He raises the gun again and fires off FOUR SHOTS in quick
succession Theyre in an odd pattern-- upper left

upper
right not quite as high lower middle-left and the very

right corner
Now there are four new holes each HISSING slightly and the
first
hole in the center

Shaking his head once more to clear it Langdon steps
forward to

the glass wall but instead of barreling against it or
throwing a

chair he simply raises one hand places it flat over the
first

hole he made the one in the center of the glass wall ---

-- and presses gently

Almost immediately a SHARP SOUND comes from the hole
beneath his

hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole
shooting up

to connect with the hole in the upper left corner

He presses just a touch harder and a SECOND CRACK starts

shooting down to the lower right Then a third anda
fourth

the glass is cracking like ice in springtime all four
extremities

connecting with the central hole and with a huge GROANING

I ask your forgiveness for putting you
in this position Vatican laws are
established to protect the church But
it is in that very spirit that I
command you to break them now

And step to the tomb Bracing their hands against the
marble
covering near the head of the tomb they plant their feet
and
push
It doesnt move
They push harder
Vittoria and the Camerlengo join them
With an almost primal GROWL of stone on stone the lid

Langdon and Chartrand stagger down the front steps of the

EXT PIAZZA NAVONA NIGHT

Piazza Navona is lightly peopled on this soft summer night
much attention directed toward the Vatican

The hood of a car glides into view nearly silent on the

of the fountain Langdon and the two Roman Cops step out
survey the area

Langdon looks to the fountain Its central core is twenty
tall a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes

which water churns Atop it stands an obelisk that climbs
another forty feet
LANGDON
(eyes searching)
Let angels guide you

But theres no angel anywhere He turns to the first
Roman Cop

LANGDON (contd)
Isnt there an angel on this fountain

ROMAN COP
Not anymore

LANGDON
The markers no good without an angel
pointing to the final-

ROMAN COP
Blame Mussolini He wanted it for
his summer-

But the Cop stops mid-sentence as he notices the black van
parked

on the far side of the fountain

Silently the Cops gesture to each other to go opposite ways
around the fountain and to Langdon to stay where he is

Langdon frustrated but no action hero watches them as they
slowly encircle the van

AT THE DRIVERS SIDE

the First Cop approaches the Drivers Window sees Mr Gray
sitting implacably behind the wheel He taps lightly with

knuckle his drawn gun at his side just out of view

Mr Gray opens the window

MR GRAY
Si

The Roman Cop looks down ever so briefly at a small
spreading
bloodstain on Mr Grays shirt When he looks back up --
-- there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him

PHOOM

He takes a bullet in the forehead slumps forward against
the

window and --

FROM A DISTANCE

we see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the
drivers

window Whole thing took about three seconds DINERS
at an

outdoor cafe dont even notice

FROM LANGDONS POINT OF VIEW

on the other side of the fountain the van rocks slightly
but he

cant see anything out of the ordinary

He turns looks to the Second Cop who is just now
approaching

from the rear of the van

WITH THE SECOND COP

this ones got his gun in front of him hes ready for

anything
We creep around the back of the van with him and just as he
comes
around to where he can see the drivers side --
-- the barrel of the silencer presses into his forehead
A

quick exchange in Italian

SECOND COP
Per favore

MR GRAY
Non posso

PHOOM
Another bullet another slumping Cop and
FROM LANGDONS POINT OF VIEW

the van rocks again but he cant see anything more detailed
than
that All he knows is the two cops arent coming out from

the

other side of the van something is going on --

-- and the bell in the clock tower starts to BONG

EVEN UNARMED LANGDON STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD JUST AS

-- the sliding door on the fountain side of the van SLAMS
open

-- revealing the figure of the FOURTH CARDINAL wrapped in

chains

and with manacled hands and feet He thrashes against the
iron

links but the chains are too heavy One of the links
bisects

his mouth like a horses bit stifling his cries for help
Mr

Gray hovers over him

Langdon GASPS --

-- and Mr Gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the
van

The Cardinal rolls falling into the fountain with an
enormous

SPLASH His weighted body sinks immediately to the
bottom

But with the new position his eyes fall on something behind
cardinal -- a plastic tube six inches across streaming
into the fountain
He goes back --

up to the surface just above the tube Air

Several PASSERS-BY notice the commotion in the fountain as
dives back under the water

Langdon drags the body of the Cardinal a few feet across the
bottom of the fountain and RIPS the tube free from its

pulling it to the Cardinals mouth
He clamps it down over the mans lips and the Cardinal

few greedy breaths from it Enough to keep him alive

Langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his
digs his hands back underneath the Cardinal to lift him but
time --

-- SIX MORE HANDS come in from all sides

Several Passers-by have jumped into the fountain to help
they all strain together --

He gestures to the nearby Cops who are already on it and
all head into the darkened tunnel

Police flashlights switch on and their beams bounce crazily
off
the walls of the tunnel

Footsteps CRUNCH as they all press in Langdon and Vittoria
content to let men with guns lead the way

It gets darker as they descend and then by the echo of
their
footfalls they can tell theyve entered --

A LARGE CHAMBER

More lights are switched on illuminating the space which
terminates in three stone walls

Its a dead end

But the Police attention is focused on the black van parked
in the

find the cannister
Langdon nods but hes fascinated by the place
In the center of the room there is an open fireplace its
still smoking The four Illuminati brands their faces
clean have been placed back in a molded velvet case
Langdon fascinated spots an empty slot in the very center
case surrounded by the four used brands

But this ones missing

As if to answer his own question he picks up the briefcase
from
the floor beside him Then studies Langdon for a moment

MR GRAY
Youre not one of them

LANGDON
Neither are you I was expecting a
fanatic

MR GRAY
When they call me -- and they all
call me -- it is so important to

trying to say something holding out a hand
Everyone else in the room is focused on the Camerlengo so
Langdon

bends down takes the dying mans hand

Rocher looks up at him desperation in his eyes trying to
communicate something but too weak to say more than

And his eyes close

Langdon withdraws his hand from Rochers and finds the
dying man
has pressed something into his palm

Langdon looks at it and it gives him a thought He turns

looks

at the Camerlengo whose chest is exposed

The crossed keys are indeed branded there -- but
theyre upside

Langdon and Vittoria on a bench in the office of the Swiss

are having superficial wounds treated The buzz in the

intense just as excited as in the square and the Sistine

Langdon looks over at Vittoria

LANGDON
Are you okay

She looks back at him nods Smiles He reaches over
interlaces
his fingers with hers and takes her hand

LANGDON (contd)
Thank God

She smiles turns his hand noticing the glass on his
wristwatch
is broken He notices seems distressed
VITTORIA
Do we have time for that story now

LANGDON
Do I have someone to tell it to

She smiles and kisses the back of his hand -- yes
A ROAR

comes from outside and we see --

EXT st PETERS SQUARE NIGHT

-- the crowd in St Peters Square in rapture There is

SINGING

theres CHANTING of the Camerlengos name Its exactly

midnight

INT SISTINE CHAPEL NIGHT

In the Sistine Chapel Cardinal Mortati is in hushed urgent
conversation with a group of seven or eight Cardinals

MORTATI
Signores you are no doubt aware
that by Holy Law the man is ineligible
for election to the papacy He is
not a cardinal he is a priest a
chamberlain And there is the
matter of his inadequate age Im
sorry the protocols of conclave are
not subject to modification I will

not call a ballot on this matter
The African Cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up
AFRICAN CARDINAL
But Signore you would not call the
ballot Surely you remember -- you
gave up your post as Great Elector

Mortati looks at him Boxed into a corner

Outside the crowd in St Peters can be heard singing
joyously

A SECOND CARDINAL steps forward

SECOND CARDINAL
They are singing in St Peters
Square What happened here tonight
transcends our laws

MORTATI
Does it Is it Gods will that we
abandon reason and give ourselves over
to frenzy Discard the rules of the
church

A THIRD CARDINAL now a peacemaker

THIRD CARDINAL
Perhaps they need not be discarded

They all look at him

THIRD CARDINAL (cont d)
I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici
Eligendo Numero 63

Most of the Cardinals look puzzled -- but Mortatis face
darkens

THIRD CARDINAL (contd)
Balloting is not the only method by
which a Pope can be elected There
is another more divine method

MORTATI
Acclimation by Adoration

THIRD CARDINAL
Si signore

The Second Cardinal sparks to this idea

SECOND CARDINAL

Of course

(answering those around

him who look confused)
Election by Adoration occurs when
all the cardinals as if by
inspiration of the Holy Spirit
freely and spontaneously
unanimously and aloud proclaim one
individuals name
THIRD CARDINAL
And the law states that Adoration
supersedes all other eligibility

requirements The candidate need
only be an ordained member of the
clergy

(DRAMATICALLY )
BuT

(they listen)
He must be present in the Sistine
Chapel at the moment of election

Many cries now of Bring the Camerlengo to us

Mortati looks deeply troubled

INT ROCHERS OFFICE NIGHT
Bandaged now Langdon and Vittoria are ushered into Rochers
office by a Swiss Guardsman
SWISS GUARDSMAN
Please wait here while we arrange your
transportation May I get you
anything

They shake their heads no thanks Settle into chairs
to the
side of Rochers desk
They look uncomfortable -- its weird to be in a dead
mans
office
Vittoria looks at his desk Thinks of something
She gets up and goes to it running her hand lightly over
it

LANGDON
What are you doing

VITTORIA
Leonardos journals I want them
back

She feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square

outline

of the inlaid panel where Rocher hid the journals She
tries

prying it open but that doesnt work she tries pushing
down on

the front of it --

-- and the panel slowly rotates open The journals
which were
laid on top of the television monitor slide out and onto

the
desk
Vittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel
again
when --
LANGDON
Wait a minute
He looks down at the monitor Thinking
At its odd key-shaped onoff switch
He pulls something from his pocket -- the key Rocher
gave him
just as he died
IN LANGDONS MIND
he sees Rochers face looking up at him dying
ROCHER

ROCHER

Rochers voice continues over but Langdon mouths the words

remembers them

ROCHERS VOICE (0S)
MADE SURE HE WAS WATCHED

IN LANGDONS MIND
Rocher is back in the office again finishing his sentence

ROCHER

IN ROCHERS OFFICE
Langdon holds the key up repeating those last words

LANGDON
For safety

He lowers the key to the monitor extending it toward the

-- and its a perfect fit He twists it
And with a Z2ZZ2ZT of power the monitor winks to life An
comes into focus

VITTORIA
Wheres that

LANGDON
Thatis the papal office

are two dead bodies on the floor covered with sheets and

LANGDON
The Pope spent a lot of time in
contemplation alone If he was

worried about seizures he must have
asked Rocher to install a camera

without telling anyone To keep an
eye on him For safety And
maybe --

He reaches down to the screen toward a touch panel at the

You dont have to be a symbologist to understand these
play pause fast forward

And rewind Langdon touches it

ON THE MONITOR

the image ZIPS backwards rapidly to the shooting and the

the way back to when Rocher and the Camerlengo were alone
together Rocher stands just behind him the Camerlengo

kneels before the fireplace

As the image starts to play forward in real time we go in
on the monitor and come out --

INT POPES OFFICE NIGHT

-- in the papal office to watch the scene in person

CAMERLENGO
The scientist kept journals So

ROCHER
You figure prominently in them
The Camerlengo turns his eyes back to the flames stirring
the

embers with a poker

CAMERLENGO
Really

ROCHER
Leonardo wasnt just a physicist he
was a Catholic priest Deeply
conflicted about the implications of
his work and in need of spiritual
guidance About a month ago he
requested an audience with the Pope
But youd know that because you
granted the audience and were present
during it

The Camerlengo twists the poker in the fire Speaks
softly

CAMERLENGO
The fool thought he had duplicated the
moment of creation

ROCHER
And the Holy Father urged him to go
public His Holiness thought the
discovery might actually prove the
existence of a divine power -- begin
to bridge the gap between religion and
science

CAMERLENGO
Science The new God Ignore the
weapons and chaos and madness

The Camerlengo looks up at him and his expression is
different

than weve ever seen it Contemptuous Angry
Violent

CAMERLENGO (contd)
His work was not religious it was
sacrilegious

ROCHER
But you saw the Popes position as a
softening of church law An old
mans weakness Your fathers
weakness

CAMERLENGO

He raised me to protect the church
Even from within

ROCHER
So you brought an old enemy back from
the dead to frighten people

CAMERLENGO
Nothing unites hearts like the
presence of evil

ROCHER
It didnt work Father

CAMERLENGO
It isnt finished

ROCHER
Ive informed Father Simeon of what I
learned and hell get word to the
Cardinals the moment conclave opens

The Camerlengo looks at him calmly for a moment --

CAMERLENGO
I was planning on doing this alone

-- and then removes the poker from the fire But it isnt a
poker its a long-handled brand with a cross of some kind
at the
end

Rocher pulls his gun holds it at his side

ROCHER
Put that down

The Camerlengo rips open his cassock with his free hand

INT PAPAL APARTMENT DAY
Inside the papal apartments Robert Langdon sits stiffly on

straight-backed chair in a hallway Couldnt look more
uncomfortable if he tried

A Swiss Guardsman stands on either side of him

The door to his right suddenly opens another Guardsman nods
him and Langdon gets to his feet straightening his jacket
INT OFFICE OF THE POPE DAY

Langdon is shown into the office where a robed figure is
dressed by two VATICAN ATTENDANTS -- the clothes he dons are
unmistakably papal vestments The figure his back to us

gestures to a nearby table

One of the Swiss Guardsmen goes to the table and picks up an
envelope hands it to Langdon

SWISS GUARDSMAN
A token of thanks from His Holiness

Langdon puzzled opens the envelope and lets the contents

into his hand

Its a thin volume but a familiar one -- the only surviving
of Galileos Diagramma Langdon nearly GASPS
The figure in the papal robes turn around It is of

Cardinal Mortati
MORTATI
This should help you complete your

scholarly work Professor

Langdon is too stunned to speak
MORTATI (contd)
I ask only that in your last will and
testament you ensure it finds its way
home

LANGDON
I -- yes I -- of course

Mortati takes a few steps forward studying Langdon

MORTATI
When you write of us -- and you will
write of us -- may I ask one thing

Langdon looks at him questioningly

MORTATI (contd)
Do so gently
LANGDON
Ill try
MORTATI

Religion is flawed Mr Langdon but
only because man is flawed
Including this one

He touches his chest lightly
The Aides now pick up the miter the spade-shaped papal hat

stands still while they place it on his head completing his
attire

LANGDON
hear youve chosen the name Luke
here have been Marks and Johns but
never a Luke

fq

MORTATI
ts said he was a doctor

LANGDON
s that a message Science and
faith all in one

MORTATI
The world is in need of both

fq
Science can heal or science can kill
It depends on the soul of the man
using the science

Langdon looks at him Likes the sound of that

LANGDON
Youll lead wisely

MORTATI
Im an old man Ill lead briefly

Mortati comes closer to Langdon raises his right hand and
makes
a gentle sign of the cross over him murmuring softly

MORTATI (contd)
Thanks be to God for sending someone
to protect His church

LANGDON
I -- dont believe He sent me
Father
MORTATI
Oh my son

He smiles

MORTATI (contd)
Of course He did

He turns and his Aides part the billowing silk curtains
that lead
to the papal balcony

We move forward with him as he steps out over St Peters
Square
and a great ROAR rises up from below

Cardinal Mortati Pope Luke I holds his arms out to his
sides an
embrace to take in the world --

-- and behind him hidden in the shadows of the papal
apartment

just behind the billowing curtains Robert Langdon folds his
hand
in front of him --

-- and bows his head
