PROLOGUE

An ornate storybook opens upon an illustration of a beautiful white shining castle which looks
down upon a green lush countryside “Once Upon a Time there lived a spoiled self-centered little
boy who would one day grow up to rule a kingdom

In FULL ANIMATION we meet the eleven year-old child as he is being dressed and fussed
over by a slew of harried servants But the boy is making it impossible for them Hes sick and tired
of getting all dressed upsick and tired of being politesick and tired of boring old ceremonies His
two regents try to explain that a Wise Woman respected throughout the landis coming to pay him a
visit The Wise Woman used to give advice to his parent and some say she has magical powers I
dont care Its my castle and Im only going to do what J want The boy pushes the servants away
Just try and stop me

The boy runs into the courtyard where he collides with what looks to be an old beggar woman
Shes coming up the walkway carrying a basket of flowers He knocks her to the ground The
courtiers gasp Servants run to help her to her feet The old woman levels her gaze at the boy Shes a
craggy old crone but with the wisdom of the ages in her eyes “Im waiting for an apology” she says
The boy seems surprised He laughs You can wait all day Youre not going to apologize He
crosses his arms stubbornly I dont have to She smiles patiently Ill give you one more chance
The boys temper flares Why should I say Im sorry to some old beggar woman I dont care about
you He angrily kicks her basket scattering flowers inthe din “ “

Fierce power emanates from her eyes as the Wise Woman gazes deep into his soul “I can see
thatyou care for nothingyou love no one but yourself Why should I the boy answers
arrogantly She shakes her head Then you are no better than a beast

The Wise Woman raises her arms She glows with power and magic The boy gasps His
eyes go wide and he bolts back into the castle

He flees past the regents who apologize to the Wise Woman on his behalf Forgive him hes
just a child” “A child in need of a lesson” she answers Please we cant let you harm him” I
warn you not to interfere Heedless of her warning the regents block the way She waves an arm at
them and they are transformed into objects a mantleclock and a candelabra She continues after the
fleeing boy transforming any and all her get in her way

The frightened boy runs through the castle looking over his shoulder He dashes into the
safety of his own room shoves furniture in front of the door and hides in a corner Moments later the
Wise Woman appears in front of him He cowers behind a chair

“Since you are no better than a beast than you deserve to look like one”

She waves her arm and the boy is transformed into a monstrous creature half-boy half-beast

“And you will remain a prisoner in this enchanted place with no human company

She takes a single red rose from her basket It begins to glow with enchantment

This Rose will bloom until your twenty-first birthday If you can learn to love another and
earn their love in return by the time the Rose withersthen the spell will be broken If not you will be
doomed to remain a beast forever

She places the enchanted Rose in an empty vase on the table

T leave you with thatand a gift”

She reaches into the basket again and emerges with an ornate golden Mirror She places it on
the table next to the Rose

This enchanted Mirror will show you any part of the wide world you wish to see Look
wellfor its a world you can no longer be part of

And in a flash of mystical light the old Wise Woman is gone

The beastchild races desperately through the castleup to the highest tower He looks down
to see her disappear into a deep enchanted mist which has surrounded the castle Im sorry” he
cries “Pleasecome back Im sorry And as the beastchild peers desperately out through the
bars we pull back to

FADE IN

EXT THE VILLAGE - A BRISK MORNING IN LATE FALL

We OPEN on a charming provincial French village winding cobblestone streets poplar trees with a
few leaves clinging to the branches sparkling fountain in the town-square stone cottages with
thatched roofs crumbling Medieval steepled church outdoor cafe tables autumn flowers in the green
shuttered windows and colorful signs above the quaint shops We follow the cobblestone street over a
small rise and find

EXT BELLES COTTAGE

It is small and maybe just a little shabbier than the rest But it has a warm rustic charm flower pots
line the steps leading to the front door a stone thatched-roofed well in the yard chickens and goats
wandering freely a vegetable garden and a weathered barn The door opens and BELLE trots down
the steps carrying a book Even dressed in poor provincial clothes she’s a stunning sight At
eighteen she already has a classically beautiful face and her eyes shine with intelligence Unlike other
beauties Belle seems entirely unaware of her looks This is no ordinary girl She tops the rise leading
into town and sings

BELLE
(singing)

LITTLE TOWN ITS A QUIET VILLAGE
EVERY DAY LIKE THE ONE BEFORE

THE VILLAGE

Autumn leaves skitter across the cobblestones as Belle eagerly starts into townand the villagers begin
to bustle about their daily business The colorful open air marketplace comes alive with flower
vendors bakers blacksmiths fruit sellers potters milkmaids merchants harried mothers elderly
ladies in the windows laughing children clip-clopping horses and gabby young girls

carriagesShe jumps over a mud puddie sidesteps a fat man and pats a little girl on the headall
without looking up

in his eye as if the whole world is his prey

Belle comes around a corner on the opposite side of the square head buried in the book Gaston stops

A group of group of twittering local girls come out of a shop and spot Gaston They giggle and
whispertrying to get his attention Gaston ignores themcyes still glued on Belle

She raises up on her tiptoes to watch them as long as she can

BELLE
Good-bye Papa Good luck

MAURICE
Goodbye Belle Take care while Im gone

Once theyre out of sight she slumps with exhaustion and blows a dangling wisp of hair out of her
eyes

EXT COUNTRY ROAD

The late afternoon sun throws long shadows on the road as Maurice and Philippe trot along Philippes
hooves crunch on the dry leaves A cold wind whips up sending ripples across the river They pass
wine caves clop across the bridge

THAT NIGHT

Theyre still not there Philippes head hangs low as he plods along

MAURICE
We should be there by now Maybe we missed the
turn
Further on
MAURICE (cont)

Now well never make it to the Faire Belle

They come to the crossroads Philippe turns aut jatically but Maurice jerks the reins

MA CE (cont)
No no Philippe this is the right road

Philippe whinnies and shakes his head

MAURICE (cont)
(insistent)
Im sure now come along

He jerks the reins Philippe snorts All right but well get lost And he reluctantly turns down the
road that leads into the wild forested region

They enter a dense gloomy ominous forest the trees withered and tangled Philippe doesnt like the
looks of this He whinnies nervously The forest grows thicker more dense blotting out the
remaining light

MAURICE (cont)
This cant be right Where have you taken us Philippe

ye Acold wind whistles through The trees creak and rustlebare branches seem to reach for them like
long brittle fingers

MAURICE (cont)
Wed better turn around

Shadows creep along the ground Knotholes in the wizened trees stare sightlessly A few wisps of
mist swirl ominously around Philippe’s hooves Water drips from a tree branch Something rustles
through the thick crackling underbrush Philippe skitters nervously

MAURICE (cont)
Whoa Whoa boy

Up ahead a shroud of mist hangs down from the trees making them looking like weird ghostly
apparitions

They press on and the mist envelops them Philippes ears twitch at every sound In the distance
they hear the bone-chilling howl of a wolf Philippe whinnies fearfullyhe skittersMaurice
struggles to hold him

MAURICE (cont)
Steady Philippe steady

Theres another howl Philippe panics

o MAURICE (cont)
Whoa Philippe

Maurice loses his grip and tumbles to the ground The wolves howl again closer now Panicked and
terrified Philippe thunders offwith the sound of the wolves on his tailSilence descends Maurice
climbs to his feet The mist drops down around him like a cloak

He stumbles backwards and turnsrunning blindly through the thick mist Theres a snarl then the
sound of padded steps and steady panting on his trail Maurice can hear the wolf tracking him He
catches a glimpse of something dark pacing him through the trees Another one

MAURICE (cont)
(terrified)
Nono
He muns headiongstumbles over a knotted rootfailsstruggles to his feet and keeps running He
yw looks back over his shoulder The wolves are only grey shapes in the mist But he can hear
themslavering hungrilyand he can see their eyes burning with hunger

Maurice looks up He sees a light that seems to float way off in distance

61490
PAGE 14 —

MAURICE (cont)
Whats that
(calling desperately)
Help Can you hear me Help

He scrabbles through the underbrush fighting his way toward the light But the trees are thick and
gnariedimpossible to get through Sharp branches tear at his clothesalmost as if theyre trying to
keep him away He glances over his shoulderyellow eyes at his heels

He turns back and almost runs into a tall orate ironwork gate tarnished and overgrown with age and
disuse It creaks open Maurice leaps through and heaves it closedjust as the wolves leap for his
throat They throw themselves violently at the barssnapping and growling desperate to get at him

Maurice backs awaytrembling The wolves finally give up They howl in defeat and slink away
EXT BEASTS CASTLE

Maurice tums around and looks up He gasps For therelooming ominously over himcloaked in
mista huge dark forboding castle It glowers lonely and sullen as if its been brooding all these
years over its solitude

Maurice cautiously moves across a bridge leading to the entrance of the castle The surrounding
grounds have grown wild with neglect Omate marble statues are barely visible beneath tangled
creeper vines

He approaches the entrance to the castle and stops short The front door stands openas if someone
is expecting him A flickering light beckons from within He moves up the steps and peers inside

INT THE BEASTS CASTLE

The interior is huge and awe-inspiring filled with tapestries statues vast corridors rich carpets and
ancient painted tapestries But it appears hollow lifeless and empty like a deserted cathedral

MAURICE
Hello

His voice echoes through the vast vacant corridors He steps inside The halls are dim Theres a
heavy musty stillness in the air Maurice looks around and notices a silver candelabra and a fancy
wooden mantleclock sitting on the carpet in front of the door

MAURICE (cont)

uptight officious English major domomuch like Basil Fawlty His pendulum swings at a rapid
pace like his heart-rate Someone wound him up way too tight and hes never wound down

MANTLECLOCK (cont)
And up there

He points up to the CANDELABRA in his hand Maurice glances sideways Two bulging eyes peer
out him His hand covers Candelabras mouth He makes muffled choking sounds Maurice releases
his hand Candelabra gasps for air as he falls to the floor

CANDELABRA
-AAHHH

Maurice quickly replaces him on the floor and looks around the castle with a renewed sense of
wonder

CANDELABRA
For shame Cogsworth Is that any way to treat our guest

MANTLECLOCK

While they argue Maurice wanders over to table and discovers a music box He pokes it to see if its
alive too Music Box giggles in reply

MUSIC BOX

Will you play me a tune little fella

We follow the echo of his voice as it travels through as until we find ourselves in a dark

CANDELABRA-

great favor by allowing us to serve you dinner

Its a formal dining hall with a bare table that stretches the length of the room During the following a
Coat Rack removes Maurices cape and bag A formal Dining Chair jumps up scoots underneath him
and slides him up to the table Candelabra hops up onto the table

CANDELABRA
Esteemed Monsieur it is with deepest pride and
greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight
And now we invite you to relax pull up a chair
as the Dining Room proudly presents

serves as Master of Ceremonies and the Serving Pieces sing and dance as they set the table and

Lefou finally realizes somethings wrong He waves his hands STOP STOP The band winds down
on a sour note Lefou approaches Gaston

She turned ya down huh

Gaston rises up covered in mud and smoldering The cronies stare at him with disbelief He grabs
the baton out of Lefous hand breaks it over his knee and shoves a tuba over Lefous head
He strides over to the wedding cake grabs the porcelain bride-and-groom off the top and crushed them

arched with fierce determination and makes a public vow

Everything is ready The Objects are all looking toward the door in anticipation of Belles arrival They

come downstairs

Beast growls and SLAMS his fist angrily onto the table Objects go flying Mantleclock looks around
frantically and jumps into an open drawer

Food and Objects have been flung everywhere Chip the teacup clings to the edge of the table his
little feet scrabbling in the air He looses his grip and falls

Candelabra leans down over the Beasts shoulder

CANDELABRA
Master have you thought that perhaps this girl
could be the one to break the spell

TEAPOT

You must learn to love another and eam their love
in return”

The Objects all lean in listening eagerly for the answer The Beast looks upand they immediately
busy themselves For a brief moment the pain is gone and his eyes fill with hope

BEAST
Do you think theres a chance she might

But then he catches a glimpse of his huge hulking shadow in the flickering candlelight Its the
shadow of a monster

BEAST (cont)
(a bitter laugh)
What am I saying A girl like that could never
learn to care for me

CANDELABRA
Look at youdefeated before youve begun
Where is your daringyour sense of adventure

The Objects nod eagerly

BEAST
(a painful bellow)
But I feel like a fool

Teapot freezes mid-pour The Objects start to ease away

CANDELABRA
(going outon alimb)
Ahso it seems the girl has more courage than
the beast

Mantleclock winces and throws his hands over his eyes
BEAST
(a low growl)
How dare you
The Objects make a break for it They leap off the table into any-ayailable hiding place Candelabra

leans back He holds his breathBut then the Beast sees the manipulation His growl turns into a
chuckle a

Touche

Objects peer out hopefully from hiding places Mantleclock peeks between his hands

(giving in)
Well cant let a girl make me look like a coward

forgets himself He jumps up and down --tossing dignity to the wind

Candelabra groans Mantleclock covers his face with his hands

We are CLOSE on the Rose that the Wise Woman gave to the Beast which has been placed in a bell jar

Footstool finally makes it to the top without spilling the tray

CANDELABRA
(praising him indulgently)
Such a good boy you are

Footstool yaps happily and slurps Candelabra in the face causing the tray to slide off his cushion
Mantleclock only barely manages to catch it in time With a glare at Candelabra he pushes the tray
back up and they continue down the hall coaxing Footstool along toward Belles door

AT BELLES DOOR

TEAPOT
The poor child must be starved by now

They put the tray on the floor in front of her door Mantleclock knocks on the door brisklybut
instead of a little knockits a large resounding‘BANG BANG BANG Mantleclock looks at his little
fisthowd I do that He looks upto Rad the Beast looming over him at the door Hes giving it a
second try

EXT BEASTS CASTLE - LATE THAT NIGHT
INT OUTSIDE BELLES DOOR
The door creaks open and Belle peers out The castle is silent She sneaks out the door and down the
hall On the way she awakens litle Music Box whos sleeping on a table One look at Belle and hes
smitten

MUSIC BOX
(A lovesick sigh)

He hops off the table and tags along behind

Belle proceeds down the stairs but she hears a tinkling sound behind her She listens for a moment
then shakes her head and continues onpast Footstool whos sleeping at the foot of the stairs Music
Box attempts to tiptoe past but he doesnt make it Footstool is instantly on his feet padding along
behind

Down the hall Candelabra and Featherduster are having a secret late-night tryst

CANDELABRA
Ahmy little fluffthe light of my life

FEATHERDUSTER
(pushing him away)

She pushes him away and flits off just as Belle passes byfollowed by Music Box and Footstool

CANDELABRA

He hops over to Mantleclock whos sleeping in an overstuffed chair

CANDELABRA (cont)
Cogsworth wake up The girl has emerged

Mantleclock jerks awake
MANTLECLOCK
Well its about time
They take off after the others

Belle knows perfectly well shes being followed because theyre making enough noise the patter of
tiny wooden footsteps the tinklingthe thump thump of Candelabras hopping She whirls around
suddenly WHOOSH They duck away She studies the empty corridor -Smiles to herself and
continues on

wow

The Objects reappear and continue to follow her
INT THE KITCHEN

Belle sneaks into the dark kitchen and tiptoes over to the Stove She opens the lid of a pot STOVE
the temperamental chef wakes up

STOVE
Til thank you to keep your nose out of my pots

Surprised Belle drops the lid CLANG

TEAPOT
Shhh Youll wake the children
Belle turns to see Teapot perched like a mother hen surrounded by her brood of sleeping cup children
BELLE

up and my fires gone out

Belle sees a croissant in a serving dish She picks it up

BELLE
This will be fine Thank you
(to Teapot)
I hope you dont mind my askingbut have
you always been a teapot —

Mantleclock suddenly bursts in the door

MANTLECLOCK
Dont answer that

BELLE
(a knowing smile)
I thought I heard someone following me
(to the door)
The rest of you might as well come out too

Candelabra Footstool and Music Box sidle in Candelabra bows graciously

CANDELABRA

circumstancesbut very happy to have such a lovely
guest ye

This is my first time in an enchanted castle and Im

MANTLECLOCK
Enchanted Who said anything about the castle

(waving an accusing finger at Stove)
It was you wasnt it Youre the one who spilled
the beans

Stove SLAMS his door angrily and huffs and puffs indignantly
BELLE
I figured it out on my own But why is the
castle deserted Where have all the people gone

The Objects look at each other wistfully Mantleclock wags his finger at them

NEAR THE WEST WING

Belle approaches the staircase leading to the forbidden West Wing Hurrying along behind the
Objects begin to get worried

MUSIC BOX
(Uh oh)

CANDELABRA
We must stop her

Its filled with broadswords and crossbows and fifty standing suits of armor Belle passes by the open

61490
PAGE 53
WEST WING STAIRCASE

She gazes up the darkened staircase Gargoyles watch her from abovecasting long forbidding
shadows in the gloom She takes a hesitant step

MANTLECLOCK
I wouldnt do that if I were you

She gasps and whirls around to find the Objects behind her Theyre clearly nervous to be in this close
proximity to the forbidden West Wing

TEAPOT
(a nervous whisper)
Come away from there

BELLE
Why

CANDELABRA
It is forbidden

BELLE
The Beast said I was free to go anywhere

MANTLECLOCK
Except the West Wing

Belle turns to gaze back up into the gloomy stairs

BELLE
(intriqued)
So thats where Ill find the secret to all this mystery

She gathers her courageand starts to climb the stairs The Objects gasp
eer
Wait Stop We cant go up therg
B

(over her shoulder)
Maybe you cantbut I can

And she keeps going without a backwards glance The Objects watch with helpless horror Candelabra
throws up his hands

CANDELABRA
Sacre Bleu

INT WEST WING CORRIDOR

Belle gazes down the long gloomy corridor Its too dark for her to see what lies at the end She begins
to move cautiously down the hallready to bolt at the slightest sound The eyes in the ancient portraits
on the wall shift to track her Belle slowsshe can feel someone watching She stopsthinks for a
minute andsmiles with relief It must be the Objects again Hands on her hips she turns
aroundbut the long corridor is dark still and utterly silent Her smiles fades She turns around
unsteadily and keeps going

61490
PAGE 54

As she nears the end of the halla heavy forboding door materializes out of the shadows She
approaches cautiously What dark secret lies on the other side Belle glances upthe gargoyles seem
to scream at her Keep away Keep away

Belle reaches out toward the ornate doorknobtakes a deep breath for courage and tums
it CREAAAK

INT THE BEASTS LAIR

Belles eyes go wide as she takes in the sight that lies before her Its the Beasts lair
darkdankfilthy strewn with broken furniture cracked mirrors torn tilted portraits doors torn
from their hinges wall sconces encrusted with old wax shredded curtains gnawed bones a matted
pile of bed coverings and ripped clothing Dusty winter light filters in through an open window where

gnarled tree vines have grown inside They creep along the filthy carpet and spread their fingers up the
wails

Its an horrific sight a violent uncivilized place where the Beast has lived with his own filth and self-
recrimination Belle shivers with equal parts disgust and trepidation She glances up at a small portrait
that has been raked by razor-sharp claws It appears to be the portrait of a young boy She looks
closer Theres something about the eyes

SLAM Belle jumps She jerks around

its only a shutter loosened by a sudden blast of cold wind But then she sees something sparkling
out of the corner of her eye The Rose sits under bell jar on a pedestal in front of the open window It
shimmers with enchantment

BELLE
A rose

She approaches the Rose with wide-eyed wonder Its sparkling delicacy seems very much out of place
in this filthy room Belle grows closer The Rose is drooping Two more petals have fallen to the
bottom of the jar

Theres a creak outside the window But Belle is entranced by the Rose and she doesnt hear it
Fascinated she reaches out toward the jar

as a huge clawed hand grips the sill of the open window
Belle carefully lifts the jar
as the Beast climbs up over the edge He stopsshocked at the sight of her there
Belle gazes with awe at the shimmering Rose She reaches out
The Beasts eyes fill with fear
Her fingers are extended out to touch one soft velvet petal
BEAST

(an urgent bellow)
NO

61490
PAGE 55

Belle drops the bell jar CRASH The Beast throws himself over the window to check on the safety of
the Rose

BEAST (cont)
(panicking)
What are you doing Did you touch it
BELLE

No

As he sees that the Rose is undamaged his fear begins to abate and fury rises up in its place He
glowers at hercyes burning with rage

BEAST
I thought I told you never to come here

He advances on hersnarling with fury She backs away from him fearfully
BELLE
(trembling with fear)
I just wantedto find out

BEAST
iness

BELLE
(holding out a hand defensively)
- Pleasestop

But he keeps cominga huge monstrous snarling enraged creature He swipes at a table which
stands in his way It crashes into the wall

BEAST
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
(an enraged howl)
NO RIGHT

Terrified Belle turns and flees for her life He howls again lost in his rage

THE STAIRCASE ae

The terrified Belle flies down the steps past Mantleclock Candelabra Teapot Footstool and Music
Box Theres one last ROAR and a resounding SLAM from the West Wing The Objects share a
horrified look and WHOOSH1theyre gone

INT BELLES ROOM

Belle runs through the doorfrightened and shakingbut with a determined expression She goes
straight to the Wardrobe and flings her doors open

WARDROBE -
(alarmed)
What is it What are you doing

Belle furiously searches for her cloak

61490

BELLE
Looking for my cloak

WARDROBE
Please my dear dont do anything rash There are so
many things about the Master that you do not understand
She finds the cloak and pulls it out
B

for me to stay here another minute
She throws the cloak over her shoulder and runs from the room
INTCORRIDOR
Belle flies out of her roomruns down the stepsthrough the foyer and out the front door
EXT CASTLE - NIGHT
Belle runs across the castle grounds toward the stables
INT STABLE
The door creaks open

She hears a joyful whinny from a stall She rushes to him and fling her arms around his neck He
nuzzles her happily

BELLE (cont)
Were getting out of here yO
THE CASTLE BRIDGE oN

Belle leads Philippe quickly across the bridge toward the gate The sound of his hooves are cushioned
by a layer of snow Belle glances back only onceThe castle looms behind her She opens the gate
for Philippe and they slip through to freedom

EXT THE MISTY FOREST
Belle leaps astride

BELLE
Fly Philippe

He whinnies and they thunder away into the night with Belle’s cloak flapping behind As they gallop
rough the forest the thick mist drops around them Belle can hardly see a few feet ahead She reins
ippe in

BELLE (cont)
Slow up

61490
PAGE 57

They cautiously pick their way through the dark misty woods A sharp dry hanging branch snags
Belles cloak She tugs at ittrying to pull free Philippes nostril flare He smells something
closetoo close He snorts and shakes the reins

BELLE (cont)
What is it

She stares into the floating misty blackness Then she sees the eyescold menacing yellow eyes The
mist Clears to reveal three hungry slavering wolves standing on a rise gazing at them silently Belle
gasps with horror

BELLE (cont)
Run Run

Philippe breaks into a frenzied gallop The wolves howl treacherously and leap after them Belle is
heedless to the branches that rip and tear at her as she clings to Philippes neck He races desperately
to save their lives mouth flecked with foam eyes wild with panic Belle glances backtheyre right
behind A wolf leaps forward to nip at Philippes heels He whinnies with pain and terror Another
wolf leaps at his flanks with vicious snapping jaws Philippe stumbles and almost goes down He
struggles to his feet and keeps running The wolves leap for them again Belle screams Philippe
rears suddenly throwing her to the ground He turnsplacing himself between the wolves and Belle
The wolves growl and snaphe flails at them with sharp hooves Belle looks around desperately for
some kind of weapon She grabs a long sharp branch and nuns at the wolves

BELLE (cont)
Get away

The wolves turneasier prey They advance snarlingBelle backs upprodding at them with the
branch as they stalk her hungrily

BELLE (cont)
Back Stay back

Belle stumbles over a rootand goes down They have her now The wolf is at her throat

Suddenly the wolf is torn off of her from behind Its the Beast Belle watchesfrozen with shock
and horror as he grapples with the snarling snapping wolves They swarm on him The creatures
growl rip tear and how in a flurry of flying claws fur and fangs

Belle pulls herself to her feet and runs to Philippesside But the wolves are no match for the powerful
Beast With a ferocious howl he flings them away from him A wolf slams into a tree and lies still
Three others see its a losing battle They whine piteously and make for the safety of the trees

But suddenly the largest wolf looms up from behind the Beast Belle gasps

BELLE (cont)
Look out

The wolf lands on the Beasts back and sinks its fangs into his shoulder The Beast howls in agony
He reaches up and tears the wolf away He holds it in his powerful handsit scrabbles piteously to
escape The Beasts eyes go red with savage rage

Belle gasps with horror at what hes about to do

CRACK We see the reflection of the beast in Belles eyes as he breaks the wolfs neck

Beast drops the animal in the snow

Belles hand fly to her mouthovercome with shock and revulsion

The Beast glances back at Bellesurprised to see her horrified expression

BEAST
(confused)
Are you all right
BELLE

You didnt have to

He looks at her without comprehension and follows her eyes to the limp wolf lying in the snow It
takes him a moment to understand

BEAST
His life was mine I took it

BELLE
(softly)
But theres something calledmercy

The Beast grimaces with pain He staggers forward and falls to his knees

BELLE (cont)
Youre wounded

Belle looks aroundwhat can she do to help him She quickly unties Philippe and leads him toward
the Beast Philippe snorts fearfully

BELLE (cont)
(to Philippe)
Its all right

She leads Philippe to the Beast He pulls himself up and leans against the horse as they limp back
through the snow toward the castle 7

How do you know if you dont even try

He doesnt have an answer for that They glare at each other in a silent battle of wills But the close
proximity grows uncomfortable and they both drop their eyes Belle turns to squeeze the rag out She

We see the Beasts clawed hand push open a door covered in dust and cobwebs He stands to the
side for Belle to enter She gives him a curious look before stepping inside Its a long abandoned
library filled floor-to-ceiling with books Belle gasps with joyful surprise and gives the Beast a big
thankful smile He shrugs it off

INT THE MORNING ROOM

During an ORCHESTRAL section Belle and the Beast are having breakfast together in a cheery corner
room Beast is hunched up in a chair much to small for him His knees bump the tablethe Objects
hang on Teapot totters and attempts to pour tea for him but she realizes Chip isnt in his saucer She
glances aroundand spots him talking to Salt Shaker She glowers Chip quickly scoots over to his
saucer

Belle picks up her spoon and begins to eat her porridge Beast watches her curiously for a moment
He shrugs and buries his head in the cereal bowl He siurps it up and leans back full and happy
with porridge dripping from his muzzle He wipes it off with the back of his hand and glances over at
Belle

She has an appalled and disgusted look on her face Candelabra picks up a spoon hides it behind his
back and saunters nonchalantly over to the Beast With a big smile to Belle Candelabra slips the
spoon to him Beast picks up the spoon in his big clumsy paw and attempts to scoop up some cereal
It spills out Chip giggles Teapot gives him a stern glare Beast tries again but he-cant get porridge
anywhere near his mouth

To save him further embarrassment Belle lifts her bow with both hands She holds it up for all to
see and tips it to her mouth Beast gives her a grateful smile He picks up his bowl with both hands

and toasts her with it
DISSOLVE TO
THE WEST WING HALLWAY
