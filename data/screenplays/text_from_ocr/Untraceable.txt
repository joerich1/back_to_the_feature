FADE IN
INT SUBURBAN BASEMENT -- RAINY NIGHT

VIDEO CAMERA POV held at hip level jerking with each step
we move in dim light past boxes of junka dormant furnace
a rusty bicycleshelves of Christmas decorationsand
bundles of Ethernet cable running beside flashing state-of-
the-art computersaround a corner into--

A WOOD-PANELED ROOM Rain rattles the ground-level windows
whose panes are covered with black soundproofing panels A
folded-up Ping-Pong table leans against a wall Ugly shag
carpeting has been stripped back from the cement floor

A small muted TV set sitting on a cardboard box plays a
prime-time hour-long drama Thunder rumbles outside

The CAMERA shakes as it is screwed into a tripod and pointed
to the cement floor At the top corner of the frame the TV
is visible

Footsteps Liquid pours A MALE HAND long and slender
lowers a saucer of milk to the floor

More footsteps A package is torn open A glue rat-trap is
slapped to the floor a few feet from the milk

A canvas bag is unzipped A tiny meow then the tinkling of
a little bell A man’s torso passes by momentarily blotting
out our view

A moment later the CAMERA zooms tighter on the milk and the
trap More meowing as a KITTEN enters the frame bounding
clumsily adorably It wears a handcrafted pink collar with
a bell

It steps into the trap It freezes pulls and pulls the bell
tinkling urgently but it cannot free its paw

Klieg lights flash on
The kitty freezes blinded
EXT SUBURBAN PARKING LOT -- RAINY NIGHT

Headlights blind us as an SUV wipers working drives up to
a guard booth

CAR RADIO DJ (0S)
--then once he’s raised a million
bucks in donations he’s gonna
shoot himself in the ass live on
the Internet
Laughter from the radio The YOUNG GUARD nods smiles and
waves the driver through

INT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER -- RAINY NIGHT

The driver whose face we cannot see pulls into a parking
spot in the barely-filled lot

CAR RADIO DJ
And guess what his website’s
called I am not making this up
Gonnashootmyselfintheasscom
Seriously

Manic laughter from the radio until the driver kills the
engine As the driver unfastens the seat belt we glimpse a
9mm Glock on the driver’s hip

The driver reaches over and grabs a black umbrella which lies
next to a half-clad Barbie doll

EXT SUBURBAN PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS -- RAINY NIGHT

Emerging from the car opening her umbrella is JENNIFER
MARSH early 30s beautiful and fierce no make-up wearing
a windbreaker

FOLLOW MARSH walking alone across the dark rainy lot toward
a bland FOUR-STORY OFFICE BUILDING

The closer she gets to the entrance the higher the CAMERA
CRANES By the time she enters the CAMERA has reached the
roof which is crowded with massive satellite dishes and
towering antennae

INT OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY -- SAME -- RAINY NIGHT

RAY 65 a security guard smiles almost paternally at Marsh
as she jams her photo ID in and out of the electronic
reader

INT OFFICE ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER -- RAINY NIGHT

As the car ascends Marsh stares at herself in the silver
doors Her hair is wet disheveled She primps at it a bit
then stops What’s the point Why bother

INT DIAL-UP ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER -- RAINY NIGHT

Marsh walks down a row of beige cubicles under fluorescent
lights In each carrel a MALE WORKER clicks away at a
desktop computer
Over the workers’ shoulders we catch glimpses of their
screens Mundane stuff mostly chat rooms newsgroups
myspacecom e-mails etc

But then a flash of hard-core pornography And on the next
monitor something worse Are those naked children on the
screen We’re moving too fast to know

Marsh stops at a large desk equipped with four large
monitors and two keyboards She removes her Glock from its
holster slips it into a drawer and locks it

EXT OFFICE BUILDING -- LATER -- RAINY NIGHT

Behind the rainy window pane we see Marsh typing quickly
navigating the web her screens flashing as pages open and
close

INT MARSHS WORK STATION -- SAME -- RAINY NIGHT

Seated closest to Marsh is GRIFFIN DOWD 30 funny-looking
bright amiable typing into a chat room Despite the
intensity of their concentration they manage to converse--

GRIFFIN
I’m serious It was the best first
date ever She was amazing She
looked exactly like her picture

MARSH

You’ll never see her again
GRIFFIN

How do you know
MARSH

Because you look nothing like

yours

Griffin laughs Marsh freezes types something hits a key
On one of her monitors a website appears She reacts to the
little victory Curious Griffin wheels his chair over and
reads the screen--

GRIFFIN
Tunethiefcom

MARSH
For the next few hours anyway
Tomorrow it’1ll have a new name
It’s taken me a week to isolate the
creep
She hits Enter and a nasty gangsta rap song blares from her
speakers Other workers look over startled and amused
Marsh lowers the volume

MARSH (contd)
He offers free downloads of pirated
music Watch what happens to my
dummy drive when I accept his offer

Marsh clicks on the download button On one of the screens
at lightning speed we see a digital representation of files
being madly copied

MARSH (cont’d)
He stole all my financial dataall
my passwordswhich I just happened
to have conveniently gathered ina
file called “Passwords” I also
threw in a keystroke recorder so I
can follow him He’s run up a half-
million bucks in fraud in the past
three weeks

GRIFFIN
What’s he into

MARSH
High-end tech and low-end porn

GRIFFIN
Are you sure it’s a guy If it’s a
woman she could be my soulmate

Ping A sixteen-digit number appears on the screen

MARSH
My dummy Am Ex Let’s hope he uses
it

The screen changes to ebaycom

MARSH (cont’d)
Huh I’m surprised he has the
patience

The screen changes to the item page of a CONSERVATIVE GOLD
SWISS WATCH

MARSH (contd)
Okay it’s a “Buy It Now” item
Fine buy it now asshole
(ping)
Thanks
Marsh starts working her keys at a furious pace her hands a
blur Even Griffin who’s used to it watches in wonder He
glances over and sees other workers glancing out of their
cubicles watching as well

MARSH (contd)
I’ve got his IP address Now I’ll
get his physical one

Phone directories appear Marsh typing with one hand and
not even looking at the screen begins typing on her second
keyboard

MARSH (contd)
There it is

A profile pop up SANDRA HOBBS 221 BAYSHORE BOULEVARD

GRIFFIN
So it is a woman

MARSH
Fifty-six years old

GRIFFIN

MARSH
An ER nurse Lived there her whole
life No priors And no history
of on-line purchases

GRIFFIN
It’s not her

MARSH
It’s gotta be a neighbor coming in
through her wireless router

Marsh’s hands are a blur again On one of her monitors we
see a SATELLITE VIEW OF TAMPA The shot tightens and
tightens moving closer to Earth With her mouse Marsh
circles a house seen from a 100 feet above

MARSH (contd)
Okay Sandra Hobbs lives here

Continuing to work both keyboards Marsh looks back and forth
among the screens She circles another house
MARSH (cont’d)
Sam Barrow age 39 Computer
programmer for the school district
Moved in six weeks ago A renter

GRIFFIN
That’s your guy

Griffin wheels his chair back to his station Marsh types
quickly A mostly-filled-in application for a search warrant
fills a screen She types in Barrow’s name and address

On the other monitor she brings up a list of Assistant US
Attorneys She points and clicks We hear a dial tone
Ringing

WOMAN (0S)

Stiles speaking

Marsh slips on a headphone and mutes the speaker

MARSH

Marsh nods takes it It reads wwwkillwithmecom Before
Marsh can react Sally speaks which sets Marsh typing--

MARSH

Gray nods The two agents use the ram splintering the door

The agents point their guns and shine their lights in In
the criss-cross of the beams we catch barred windows a wall
of merchandise still in its boxes and a huge plasma TV
showing a frozen image from a terribly violent video game

A SHADOWY MALE FIGURE clutching a hard drive still connected
by a couple of cords to the computer sinks to the floor
Gray steps in with his flashlight

GRIFFIN
What the hell is this
MARSH

Marsh types opening windows until she’s got the cable news
playing live She drags it over to killwithme and lines it
up next to the site’s TV set The two broadcasts are

identical in perfect sync Griffin shakes his head--

GRIFFIN
Just when you think you’ve seen it

MARSH
Look -- a message from our sponsor

A banner of red text crawls across the bottom of the screen

STELLA
Shit you scared me

MARSH

STELLA
(delighted)
Hey that’s what I used to say to
you when you were little

MARSH
I know Mom that’s why I said it

STELLA

sitting nearby--

MARSH
There was a crash on the I-50
Everybody just had to line up for a
look

happily

EXT MARSH’S HOUSE -- LATER -- MORNING

DISTANT POV The door opens and Annie comes running out
being chased by Marsh Marsh scoops her up and carries her
to a Volvo parked in the driveway Stella sits behind the
wheel

CLOSE ON THE CAR Marsh lowers Annie into the back seat and
fastens her seat belt

MARSH
Come on nice and tight

Annie comically pretends that it’s so tight that she can’t
breathe Marsh laughs and shuts the door As Stella backs
out Marsh turns and looks at the unruly front lawn Stella
stops and lowers the window

STELLA
Don’t even think about it
MARSH
But--
STELLA

Sweetheart Get some sleep
Please Good sleep

Marsh smiles at her mother’s worries As the car drives
away Marsh walks back to the house She stops and studies
the lawn Her mom’s right She shouldn’t

INT MARSH’S GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER -- MORNING

Marsh hoists the power lawn mower off a hook on the wall

fades as she remembers something She jerks to her feet

INT MARSH’S BEDROOM -- MINUTE LATER -- DAY

Still in her underwear Marsh sits at her computer The
kitten is still there but now all four of its paws as well
as its stomach tail and bell are stuck in the glue Only
its slow-blinking eyes tell us that it is even alive The
text crawl reads LABATYDLABATYDLABATYD

Marsh stares then whispers to herself--

MARSH
Life’s A Bitch And Then You Die

She starts to type

MARSH (contd)
No kidding

She types several commands into a unix shell Trace routing
algorithms begin to run A different screen shows possible
IP addresses The list begins growing from ten to hundreds
to thousands Marsh shakes her head at the futility

INT CYBER DIVISION HEADQUARTERS -- LATER -- EVENING

INT DIAL-UP ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER -- EVENING

Brooks walks down the aisle of cubicles to where Marsh
Griffin and Wilks stand around Marsh’s desk

BROOKS
All right Jennifer show me this
tortured kitty of yours

He and Marsh lock eyes They have a thorny subtext Marsh
doesn’t respect him and he knows it Brooks is attracted to
her and she couldn’t care less

MARSH
The torture’s over

She steps aside revealing her monitor where the kitten lies
broken and flat face down dead in the glue

BROOKS
I should say so

A respectful beat then Griffin murmurs--

GRIFFIN
Poor Lulu

Everyone looks at him strangely

GRIFFIN (cont‘d)

What That’s her name

(reading)
The ownerScotty Hickman26
from Columbiasays she was
snatched a few days ago from his
front lawn during a yard sale He
recognized the fancy collar

BROOKS
Not Columbia Maryland

GRIFFIN
That’s right

BROOKS

So this site which could have
originated anywhere from Oslo to
Timbuktu--

GRIFFIN
--is streaming locally Yes sir

BROOKS
The odds of that are--

MARSH
A billion to one if it were a
coincidence But it’s not

Brooks glances at her Pause A tiny stand-off

BROOKS
Care to explain

MARSH
Id be happy to We only found out
about the site because within
minutes of it going up it was
tipped to the County Sheriff and
the Baltimore PD Both tips came
from an Inner Harbor pay phone
Whoever’s behind the site lives in
the area and wants attention

On the screen a text banner appears GYETSMTCGYETS
---MTCGYETS MTC

BROOKS
What’s that
MARSH
Chat-room shorthand “Glad You

Enjoyed The Show More To Come”

The emoticon comes strutting across the screen It stops and
laughs mockingly at its audience Brooks smirks--

BROOKS
Cocky little bugger

MARSH
He can afford to be His site’s
incredibly sophisticated Every
frame of the video’s hidden and
relayed among all of its viewers
Lots of viewerslots of relays
like a mosaicand it’s impossible
to tell where it originated It’s
almost like he’s built his own peer-
to-peer serving network for every
frame

(beat)

(MORE )

MARSH(contd)
Let’s alert STAD and see if it’s a
new distributed serving technology
they recognize Meanwhile Id
like to pull Griffin off Innocent
Images and--

GRIFFIN
(to Brooks)
I really could use the break sir

MARSH
Working together we might be able
to--

BROOKS

I’ve got a better idea Call the
Humane Society

Brooks casually walks away

MARSH
Wynn I really think--

Brooks stops and turns back with a patronizing air--

BROOKS
Now I know how you single women
love your felines but given the
state of the world don’t you think
there are more important things for
you to worry about Maybe some-
thing under our jurisdiction

MARSH
(firmly )
This is our jurisdiction It’s
obscenity
BROOKS

(eyes narrowing)
Shocks your conscience does it
Well it’s a good thing you never
met my Granny Brooks ‘cause she
used to drown ’em by the litter
(to everyone else)
Back to work gentlemen

Brooks raps his knuckles on a desk and walks on Marsh is
pissed

Marsh snapping to gives him only the faintest smile back
She glances at her laptop computer sitting nearby She
can’t help herself She flips it open and starts to type

We hear the music of killwithmecom When the next window
opens Marsh sees something she did not expect Her face
changes terribly

Marsh nearly jumps out of her skin Stella carrying a
grocery bag stands at her closed window pointing to the
parking meter

STELLA

EXT CYBER DIVISION HEADQUARTERS -- LATER -- DAY
Marsh strides quickly across the parking lot

MALE VOICE (0C)
Hold it right there copper

Marsh smiles when she sees Griffin disheveled and unshaven
climbing out of his used sports car

MARSH
Sorry about the timing

GRIFFIN

(hurrying to join her)
Hey it’s not your fault I had
nothing to do anyway Except sit
around trying to figure out why I
couldn’t get to first base last
night with a date who was both
promiscuous and unattractive

MARSH
Maybe if you went out with women
youve actually met

GRIFFIN
There’s a prescription for lone-
liness I work nights Who do I
meet

Marsh laughs and puts a consoling arm around him
INT MARSH’S WORK STATION -- MOMENTS LATER -- DAY

Marsh settling into her chair is already urgently typing
into her keyboard--

MARSH
For the past two weeks it hasn’t
changed a saucer of curdled milk
a dead kitten a pile of maggots
Then Friday night around eleven
the site was down Gone I hoped
forever But then an hour ago--

She hits Enter What Griffin sees on the screen makes his
face unhinge He looks closer He can’t believe his eyes

REVERSE ANGLE It’s Herbert Miller the man from the Orioles
game in the same basement room as the kitten bound and
gagged cemented upright at the waist into the floor

Bare-chested Miller is surrounded on three sides by A DOZEN
INFRARED HEAT LAMPS Just two are turned on glowing red

Miller drips with sweat defiant struggling yelling into
the gag In the background the TV still sitting on the
box shows a NASCAR race

Griffin leans down types hits keys then using Marsh’s
mouse drags a live network NASCAR broadcast across the
screen and places it beneath the race on the website

GRIFFIN
Still streaming live

Marsh points with her cursor to the top left corner of the
screen where a digital counter marked ETOD counts down the
time 234632

MARSH
Estimated Time of Death

On the right side of the screen Marsh points to a counter
marked NOV with a rapidly increasing number 27108

MARSH (contd)
Number of Viewers

She points to the text crawl at the bottom of the screen

MARSH (contd)
This is what connects them

The text reads The more that watch the faster he cooks
--The more that watch the faster he cooksThe more that
watch the faster he cooks

Griffin is horrified but then he realizes

GRIFFIN
Wait it’s bullshit right It’s
fake It’s gotta be The guy’s an
actor

WILKS (0S)
He’s a helicopter pilot

They turn There’s Wilks holding up a Baltimore Police
Department missing person’s report bearing a color photo of
Miller surrounded by his happy wife and three smiling
daughters

INT CYBER-DIVISION HEADQUARTERS HALLWAY -- LATER

Marsh and Griffin stride quickly Griffin says under his
breath--

GRIFFIN
You know just because you were
right and he was wrong doesn’t
mean you have to rub his nose in
it

Marsh’s smile does not reassure
INT BROOKSS OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER -- DAY

Brooks leans back in his desk chair frowning skeptically at
his computer screen which shows Herbert Miller trapped in
the cement Marsh and Griffin sit across from him Griffin
reads aloud summarizing from the report--

GRIFFIN
Herbert Miller 54 A pilot for
Liberty Executive Charter Lives
in Bramford ten minutes from here
Friday after work he called his
wife and said he had a great ticket
for the O’s game that he got from
an ad he placed on Craig’s List
She never heard from him again

BROOKS
Does he have any priors

GRIFFIN
(confused)
Miller II--

MARSH
How is that relevant

Brooks looks out the window thinks

BROOK
Remember the snuff film that was
sent into the LA office last
year Teenage geisha cut right in
two Six weeks later they found
her safe and sound waiting tables
in Little Tokyo Maybe Millers
involved somehow maybe--

Marsh can’t believe what he is saying but before she can
respond Wilks appears at the open door--

WILKS
(pale shaken)
Sir killwithme it’s-- Well-- I
think you should take a look--

Brooks exasperated hits his keyboard awakening the screen
Marsh and Griffin walk around the desk for a look

Miller is slumped over breathing hard pouring sweat The
Viewer counter spinning much faster now hits 1120000
The Estimated Time Of Death has spun below 23 hours

MARSH
If those viewer numbers are real
it’s a rate of increase that--

BROOKS
It’s because they know it’s fake
MARSH
Or because they hope it isn’t
(pointing)
That’s how he controls the time of

death

A third heat lamp has begun to glow orange Miller violently
bucks crying out into his gag

GRIFFIN
What’s driving up the numbers like
that It can’t just be word of
mouth

EXT MILLERS’ BRAMFORD HOME -- AFTERNOON

Come on I’1ll read you a story

They exit
INT DIAL-UP ROOM -- NIGHT

THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN the row of agents and we see what they
are working on exactly what they were working on in the
film’s opening and at the same measured pace Nothing has
changed until

WE STOP ON MARSH driven exhausted typing fast a finished
Chinese meal at her side One small corner of her central
monitor shows Miller lying motionless soaked breathing
hard Nine of the twelve lamps are blaze now

The Viewer counter has climbed to 6975000 and the
Estimated Time Of Death had moved below 5 hours

MARSH
Interesting The site blocks all
foreign users Only US-based IP
addresses can get on

GRIFFIN
How patriotic

(beat)
The e-mail offering Miller the
Orioles ticket and the tips coming
into the TV stations were all sent
from different mail servers and
they were all shut down ten seconds
after the messages were sent

MARSH
No surprise

Griffin wheels his chair over He pulls the egg roll out and
reads from a note pad--

GRIFFIN
I searched every newsgroup and found
the very first post that mentioned
killwithme It appeared about thirty
seconds after the site went up

(reading)
“A cat caught in a mouse trap How’s
that for irony It’s streaming live
on killwithmecom It’s awesome
Check it out”

(beat)
(MORE )

GRIFFIN(cont d)
I traced it to a Georgetown
sophomore named Andrew Kinross
But then I looked closer and saw
the post didn’t actually originate
from his computer

MARSH
Our guy got into his machine and
posted it from there

GRIFFIN
That would be my guess

MARSH
So let’s go after the originating
computer’s IP

GRIFFIN
It’s worth a shot

Griffin wheels back to his desk He is struck by the sight
of Miller on the screen staring straight at him

GRIFFIN (contd)
Too bad he wasn’t a Boy Scout He
could blink Morse Code and tell us
where he is

Marsh smiles and shakes her head at Griffin’s odd mind then
begins to type

INT BASEMENT -- NIGHT

Miller cemented into the floor is slouched over his skin
burned violet his lips and eyelids crusted facing the video
camera The air shimmies with the fierce heat

Miller’s lifeless eyes slowly lift Ten feet away along the
dirty wall lies the dead kitten -- a maggoty patch of dried
fur set in glue

CLOSE ON A DIGITAL READOUT When the Viewer counter goes
over 8000000 a hard drive flashes and the tenth lamp whirs
to life Miller’s eyes widen and he moans helplessly

INT DIAL-UP ROOM -- SAME -- NIGHT

Marsh and Griffin have fallen into a fast efficient rhythm
together--

MARSH
I’m trying to find a footprint on
Kinross’s box

GRIFFIN
I think I see it

MARSH
Right

GRIFFIN
Got it

MARSH

I have it too

GRIFFIN
Running trace-route Well get it
Its been bounced through a relay--

MARSH
Except it isnt just masked -- its
encrypted

GRIFFIN

»-using a DOD encryption program
Interesting Not a problem

As Griffin types his screens flash with graphics and data
streams The two work and relay information in perfect sync

GRIFFIN (contd)
Okay I’ve unencrypted the orig-
inating IP A couple of duplexers
a firewall A major firewall as
good as ours

MARSH
I just burned it down
GRIFFIN
Maybe he’s not as smart as we
thought
MARSH
Maybe
GRIFFIN

I’m in his hard drive I’ve got his
root directory

MARSH
Check out the recent activity
Whats he been up to

GRIFFIN
Reading about his own site I’m
sorry but that’s just tacky

MARSH
Let’s ID him Any commercial
transactions

GRIFFIN

Got the four-by-four digits of a
credit card First digit is a 5

MARSH
Mastercard I see it Cross-
referenced with an on-line receipt
fromChang’s Three Rivers

She glances at the Chang’s Three Rivers bag right next to
her Her expression changes Griffin is oblivious

GRIFFIN
He’s got good taste

MARSH
Orange Chicken brown rice and
four egg rolls -- that’s exactly
what we ordered Except we got two

egg rolls

This gets Griffin’s attention He looks at Marsh and
without breaking eye contact slides open a desk drawer to
reveal two more egg rolls Marsh sits back pissed

MARSH (cont’d)
He routed us right back to our own
computer Shit

GRIFFIN
So he’s not as smart as we thought
He’s smarter

They sit for a moment breathing hard a bit spooked

GRIFFIN (cont‘d)
He’s in our network you know

MARSH
Not for long Internal Ops will--

An alert on her screen starts to flash red

MARSH (contd)
There He’s purged

Marsh’s Treo vibrates She looks down hits a key On the
screen the text message is nothing but a field of random
numbers

Before Marsh can react she notices Brooks striding down the
hall with Detective John Box Brooks holds open a conference
room door and gestures for Marsh to join them

GRIFFIN
Maybe that’s the profiler you asked
for

MARSH

(getting up)
Not unless Quantico’s changed its
dress code

INT DIAL-UP CONFERENCE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT

Marsh enters a bit warily Detective Box stands exhausted
looking out the window sipping coffee

BROOKS
Jennifer Marsh -- Detective John
Box Baltimore PD’s got him on the
Miller abduction

Box turns to face her A charged moment Some chemistry
Maybe even a flicker of recognition They shake hands

MARSH
A pleasure

He smiles Slightly awkward beat

MARSH (cont’d)
So you’re on the team You’1l be
joining the task force

BOX
No team just me

BROOKS
And we won’t be using the task
force until we have a better idea
of what we’ve got here

Marsh stares him down for a beat

MARSH
Well that’s idiotic

BROOKS
(amused to Box)
What’d I tell you

BOX
(with a smile)
It’s a wonder the State Department
hasn’t come calling

MARSH
If you’1l excuse me--

BROOKS
No I will not Get back in here

Marsh reluctantly obeys

BROOKS (cont‘d)
It’s past John’s bedtime -- give him
what you’ve got and he’1l do the
same for you then you can both go

home
MARSH
Now I still have--
BROOKS
Im switching you to days
MARSH
(sharply)

Why I’m on this schedule because
of my daughter so--

BROOKS
You play nice now

Brooks exits shutting the door behind him Tense silence
Marsh exhales heavily and sits resigned--

MARSH
You first

BOX

We found Miller’s car parked three
blocks from Camden Yards No
prints but his own The stadium
cameras caught nothing We’re
asking the public for their help

(beat)
What else Oh yeah I talked to
his wife

Still holding his coffee cup Box uses his other hand to flip
open his notebook

BOX (cont’d)
Patty She’s a wreck Doesn’t
know why anyone would do this to
him

He flips the notebook shut That’s it Marsh can’t help but
smile

MARSH
Thorough

BOX
What can I say Miller’s a good
guy A veteran Coaches Little
League Church every Sunday

MARSH
Then why’d the subject pick him
BOX
“Subject” What is this science
class
MARSH

What would you prefer

BOX
How about the “piece of shit”

MARSH
Why’d he pick Miller

BOX
I don’t know Maybe it was random

Marsh thinks for a few beats

MARSH
What about the guy who owned the
kitten You talk to him

BOX
Hickman Yeah he’s a jackass

Box slaps down a Baltimore Sun with a picture of a spike-
haired chubby malcontent in an orange-and-yellow uniform

BOX (cont’d)
He just wants the collar back
It cost him twelve bucks on ebay
That’s a lot when you’re an
assistant manager at Burger King

Marsh settles into thought Box is intrigued by her
intensity

BOX (cont’d)
What’ve you got for me

She looks at him assessing Then speaks softly--

MARSH
There’s no such thing as an
untraceable websitebut now I’m
not so sure Killwithme is like
nothing I’ve ever seen or imagined
As long as the prime-upload site is
a ghost this guy can kill Miller
-or anyone else he wantshe can
invite the whole world to watch and
join inand there’s not a thing
we can do to stop it

BOX
On your end
MARSH
That’s right
BOX

Guess I have some work to do
Box rises from his chair She watches him go
INT DIAL-UP ROOM HALLWAY -- MINUTE LATER -- EVENING

Emerging from the room Box goes one way and moments later
Marsh goes another Marsh walks back to her desk begins
packing up her stuff She speaks to Griffin--

MARSH
Wynn’s switching me to days

When she doesn’t get a response she looks over and sees
Griffin sitting motionless She walks over Looks

A terrible sight All twelve of the lamps glow red Miller
lies dead his skin a deep purple cracking and peeling his
hair smoking

The Viewer counter is spinning like a slot machine moving
above 11056000 and the Estimated Time Of Death has stopped
at 000000

GRIFFIN

There was time but then the
numbersthey just exploded

The text banner appears ROTFLTYFAYSMTCROTFL
TYFAYSMTCROTFLTYFTAYSMTC Marsh reads
thinks then translates--

MARSH
Rolling On The Floor Laughing

Angry but stoical she goes back to her desk She unlocks
her drawer and jams her Glock back in her holster She grabs
her jacket On her way out she murmurs--

Well see about that

Annie munches cereal She looks over notices something and
smiles--

Mommys sleepy

Stella seated next to Annie pouring herself coffee looks
over--

STELLA
You know I think she is

ANGLE ON MARSH looking dead tired

MARSH
Why do you say that

She pretends to nod off snoring into her oatmeal Annie
giggles Stella pours Marsh some more coffee

STELLA
It’s a big deal you know turning
your schedule upside down It’s
crazy-making Or in your case
crazy increasing

MARSH
Shouldn’t you be getting senile
soon

STELLA

But there is an upside A normal
schedule might lead to other normal
activities

MARSH

(wryly)
You mean d-a-t-i-n-g

ANNIE
No spelling

Annie blows a whistle on a cord around her neck Marsh jumps
out of her skin

MARSH
Oh baby Too early

STELLA
Did you see the pretty lanyard she
made at day camp

Marsh’s cell phone rings Annoyed she opens it and looks at
the caller ID She answers immediately--

MARSH
What’s up

As she listens she rises from her chair shocked her face
growing more and more alarmed Annie makes a face at her
grandmother

ANNIE
Uh-oh

EXT DC RESIDENTIAL STREET -- MORNING

HELICOPTER SHOT the Colonial house has been cordoned off
with yellow evidence tape behind which stand DOZENS OF
ONLOOKERS visibly excited taking photos with their cell
phones

A Forensic Science Unit Van is parked outside along with
several police cars TWO CORONER TECHNICIANS carry Millers
remains in a zippered bag to their white van

As we hover overhead we notice DETECTIVES and UNIFORMED
OFFICERS at different doorways questioning NEIGHBORS

And in the midst of all of this -- John Box striding across
the lawn in a hurry He jumps into his car

EXT BALTIMORE CITY HALL -- DAY
Marsh hurries up the marble steps of the historic building
EXT BALTIMORE CITY HALL CORRIDOR -- LATER -- DAY

Marsh walks down the hall swarming with activity and stops
at the Press Room door where she flashes her badge

INT CITY HALL PRESS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

Marsh enters the bright cluttered room which is packed with
network and cable TV crews reporters and photographers in
the middle of a press briefing

At the microphone stands MICHAEL BECKETT Chief of the
Baltimore Police 60’s silver-haired red-cheeked reading
from prepared notes

Behind him stands John Box as well as representatives from
the Secret Service the District Attorney’s office and the
local Sheriffs office

BECKETT
--at which time Trey Restom the son
of California Congressman Joseph
Restom discovered the partial
remains of Mr Miller inside the
vehicle He immediately phoned local
authorities who responded--

INT BALTIMORE CITY HALL -- LATER -- DAY

Marsh and Box stride quickly down the hall--

BOX
Miller was a god-damn chopper
pilot What’s his connection to a
US Congressman

MARSH
The killer had to dump the body
somewhere Why not on a national
stage

Box stops dead

BOX
Youre saying there is no connec-
tion He did it for a bullshit
press conference

MARSH
Maybe
BOX
What to build up his fan base
MARSH
They’re not fans They’re

accomplices

Box takes a beat then disgusted pushes through the ornate
door

EXT CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY
Box lights a cigarette as Marsh emerges behind him

BOX
But why’d he pick Restom when he
had 434 other dishonest yellow-
tied douche bags to choose from

MARSH
Good question

Box throws her a smile unused to the compliment

MARSH (cont’d)

I know because I asked it myself
(beat)

The Director testified before him
once Restom sits on the House
Judiciary Committee He’s a huge
supporter of Net Neutrality All
traffic treated equally No
restriction on content

BOX
You’d think the piece of shit would
be for that

MARSH
Yeah you would

They both think for a beat then start to descend the steps

MARSH (contd)
What’d you find on scene

BOX
A neighbor saw some a van drive by
around four am Another heard a
car door slam a minute later They
assumed it was the Post being
delivered They were wrong As
for Restom’s car no sign of forced
entry So it looks like our guy’s
a god-damn locksmith too

(beat)
Today my men’re gonna work the tech
angle computer companieson-line
electronics storesthose freaks who
build their own computers

MARSH
Power Users I’m one

He smiles checks his watch and descends faster She
struggles a bit to keep up

MARSH (contd)
What’s the hurry

BOX

(slowing down)
A house call Arthur James Elmer
An engineer at a place called
DynoTech Solutions He was fired
six months ago for installing a
wireless web cam in the men’s room
His landlady says ever since the
kitty bit the glue hes been
talkin’ about the site non-stop

They reach his car

BOX (cont’d)
Get in we’ll go together

MARSH
No thanks

BOX
What’s wrong

MARSH
I don’t do field work

BOX
But that’s where our guy lives

MARSH
I’m better behind a desk Anyway
Brooks mobilized the task force so
I really should

His eyes meet hers He flips his cigarette and gets into his
car

BOX
I’1l keep you posted

Marsh anxious watches him drive off

Box enters glances around the kitchen taking it in then
his eyes rest on ARTHUR JAMES ELMER 30 skinny brainy

wearing khakis and a stained T-shirt

ELMER
You’re Box

BOX
That’s right

ELMER
Unusual name

BOX
Wasn’t up to me

ELMER
You really think I baked that guy

BOX
Maybe

ELMER
I’m flattered I found it highly
entertaining Especially at the
end The way the viewership
increased geometrically Like some
sort of epidemic You know AIDS
took twenty years to reach a
million hits Killwithme did it in
less than two hours You know what
they oughta do Sell ad space

Box stares then slaps the warrant onto his chest An
officer moves Elmer away from his door The other officer
lays his hand on his weapon and leads the way downstairs

INT ELMERS BASEMENT APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS -- SAME

Box walks down creaking wooden steps past a swinging light
bulb into a dim dirty basement apartment

Every inch of the walls and ceilings is covered with a photo
collage of YOUNG MALE MODELS cut from magazines every inch
covered in heavy shellack

Box walks over to a large work table covered with garbage
and bearing a massive amount of computer equipment A big
monitor shows the killwithme screen -- black

Box spots a bucket next to the chair Picks it up When the
odor of urine hits him he turns his head The officer
points to a bank of monitors--

OFFICER
Guy’s got enemies

Box looks The monitors show live web cam images of
different views from around the house--

BOX
No he just thinks he does

Elmer is led into the room by the other Officer Box sees
stacks of DVDs everywhere all bearing handwritten labels

BOX (cont’d)
You like movies huh

ELMER
Who doesn’t

BOX
Me You burn your own huh

Box pops a DVD in a player and hits play

BOX (contd)
That’s illegal

Elmer smirks Box hits pause freezing the FBI WARNING about
illegal copying He throws Elmer a dead-serious glance

BOX (cont’d)
You can’t say we didn’t warn you

INT MARSH’S WORK STATION -- LATER -- DAY

Marsh walks quickly down the hall checking a message on her

her side beaming

MARSH

Marsh smiles at the happy surprise
INT TASK FORCE MEETING ROOM -- LATER -- DAY

Seated in the room are a DOZEN MEN and a COUPLE OF WOMEN
representing the County Sheriff the FBI and the Baltimore

BROOKS
Since we’ve got a few new members

ourselves

CLOSE ON MARSH as the introductions quickly proceed She
hears a vibration Checks her Treo An e-mail from Annie
She opens it Annie writes “Hi Momy Grandma is helping
me wthi the cpmter I love you”

Marsh starts to write back Griffin gives her a gentle jab
with his elbow She looks at him doesn’t understand His
eyes bulge She realizes that it’s her turn

MARSH
Sorry Jennifer Marsh I’ma

GRIFFIN
Griffin Dowd I work here too
In Innocent Images Which is just
a poetic way of saying internet

The last few people introduce themselves and Wynn takes over
again--

BROOKS
Before we discuss a game plan you
should know that we do have a
suspect A search warrant has been
issued for an Arthur James--

MARSH
Elmer’s not our guy

All eyes turn to Marsh Brooks smiles--

BROOKS
Ms Marsh hasn’t left her desk all
day and yet somehow she feels the
confidence to declare--

MARSH

Friday starting at 1 pm Elmer
was logged on to a chat room for
twelve consecutive hours At the
time Miller disappeared Elmer was
busy trying to arrange a private
chat with the first tenor of the
Gay Men’s Chorus of Greater Tacoma

Brooks frowns then notices Box standing at the open door

BROOKS
You hear that John
BOX
She’s right He’s not our guy

But it still felt good arresting
him
A few chuckles Box falls into a seat next to Marsh

MARSH
Does it really matter Who said it

Annie nods emphatically This triggers an idea in Marsh

She reflects for a few beats

MARSH (contd)
Would you excuse me for a second

Okay but only one

Marsh gets up and leaves the room
ANNIE (contd)

MARSH

There are 13 billion internet users

(starting to type)
And there goes my holiday weekend

They hang up All business now she begins to type her face
taking on a fierce expression that carries over into--

EXT MARSH’S BEDROOM WINDOW -- LATER -- NIGHT

FROM ACROSS THE STREET Framed in the glass Marsh works at
her desk under a bright lamp

INT MARSH’S BEDROOM -- DAYNIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS OF MARSH HARD AT WORK her computer screen
flashing with data on Kinross chat rooms pages news group
postings She’s clearly not finding what she’s looking for

At one point Annie interrupts pulling Marsh from the desk
by her hand

At another Marsh dead on her feet watches from her window
as Stella and Annie play catch in the front yard

INT ANNIE’S BEDROOM -- LATER -- DAWN

In bed Annie lies sound asleep sprawled amid paste
scissors construction paper and a stack of red-white-and-
blue decorations

Marsh sits down next to her smiling tenderly at the mess
She clears some of it away then pulls Annie’s blanket up
higher

She kisses Annie’s cheek then slowly lays her head down As
Marsh’s eyes flutter shut the CAMERA DRIFTS TO THE WINDOW
where the sun rises and birds sing

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET -- MORNING

Birds also sing on a charming neighborhood of generous middle-
class homes set back amid thick foliage American flags hang
from many of them A big black BMW glides down the block

INT BMW -- SAME -- MORNING

JERRY CARVER 40’s handsome tanned well-coiffed drives
slowly looking between a slip of paper in his hand and the
passing addresses

Finally he pulls into the secluded driveway of a middle-
class home and parks behind a big gold Cadillac

EXT MIDDLE-CLASS HOME -- MOMENTS LATER -- MORNING

Carver admiring the house walks up to the front door He
pushes the doorbell While he waits he looks around
admiring the garden the oak tree the fence

Right next to Carver at a side window a curtain parts anda
YOUNG MAN looks out Carver doesn’t notice

MEET OWEN 30 his skin unwholesome his eyes devoid of
light He studies Carver for a few long beats then he
disappears

Moments later just as Carver is about to press the bell
again Owen opens the door His smile is bright but stiff
as though his face might crack

Carver tries to hide his surprise at the young man’s
disturbing appearance

OWEN
Youre right on time

CARVER
Yeah it’s a curse I’ve spent
half my life waiting for people

Carver flashes a warm smile and extends a manicured hand

CARVER (contd)
Jerry Carver

Owen looks at the hand as though he has never seen one
before Then he smiles and shakes it without force

CARVER (contd)
Great address by the way Eights
bring prosperity

OWEN
I didn’t know that

CARVER
Love the Caddy too

As Carver moves past him and disappears inside Owen looks
out at the car

OWEN
It had a dent but I got it fixed

EXT MARSH’S BACKYARD -- DAY

Griffin stands on a picnic table threading a garland of
Annie’s decorations into the branches of a tree

GRIFFIN
You made ‘em all by yourself

ANNIE
Grandma helped a little My mom
couldnt ‘cause she was working on
the computer

GRIFFIN
She works hard huh

Annie nods emphatically

GRIFFIN (cont‘d)
How’s that

Annie grins up at her handiwork

INT MIDDLE-CLASS HOME -- LATER -- MORNING

Owen stands in the living room his face impassive while
Carver admires the decor which is in a contemporary Asian

style

CARVER
You like Asia I guess

OWEN
Just Korea

Awkward beat

CARVER (0S)
Well you make it work

OWEN
Thank you

Another awkward silence

CARVER
Soyou gonna let me see ‘em

OWEN
Of course

FOLLOW OWEN leading Carver through the spotless house All
of the rooms are decorated in the rosewood teak and
porcelain Carver chatters uneasily--

CARVER
I gotta tell ya a 710 Pullman and a
712 Observation Car When I read
your e-mail I almost passed out
If they’re really in mint condition--

OWEN
Dad and I used to play with them
And we played Ping-Pong And we
built things Toys Contraptions
We had quite a workshop

Owen stops and fixes Carver with a dead stare

OWEN (contd)
He passed away last year

CARVER
Oh I’m sorry to hear that

Owen nods slowly then opens a small door revealing a dark
narrow staircase descending into pitch blackness He hits
the light smiles and gestures for Carver to go first

Carver obeys a bit reluctantly As he passes by Owen
touches a Taser to the back of Carver’s neck 50000 volts
Carver drops like a sack of potatoes down the stairs which
blends with--

EXT MARSH’S BACKYARD -- DAY

Griffin dumps charcoal into the grill Marsh arranging
beverages in a cooler of ice--

MARSH
So how was your date

GRIFFIN
Not bad But I think today’s will
be better She’s a social worker
Shell be hear any minute

MARSH
(amused )
Youre kidding

GRIFFIN
No -- so behave

(beat)
How was your weekend

MARSH
I only made it through a few months
of Kinross’s posts It’s insane
The kid was on line sixteen hours a
daypushing websites sharing
links uploading videos

GRIFFIN
Was Not anymore

MARSH

Not since he died

(off Griffin’s shock)
A month ago Of something called
diabetic ketoacidosis It happens
when you skip your insulin for a
few days Within a few hours of
his body being discovered the site
went up and his recommendation
appeared

GRIFFIN
You think our guy killed him

MARSH
I don’t know The coroner called
it accidental

(beat)
What’d you find on Miller

GRIFFIN
Not much His company caters mostly
to corporate attorneys and bankers
who need to get in and out of DC in
a hurry No serious ties to politics
or high tech

Griffin tosses in a match and the coals burst into flame

INT OWEN’S BASEMENT -- DAY

Naked but for boxers and black socks Jerry Carver lies
unconscious bruised gagged slumped against the folded-up
picnic table

His torso is snaked with patriotic bunting An IV tube is
buried in his clavicle and taped in place

A few feet away we see the rotting shape embedded in the
cement floor of where Herbert Miller was cut in two

Suddenly one of Jerry Carver’s lifeless arms jerks to life
like a marionette’s Then the other one does They both
snap up and bang back against the Ping-Pong table

We realize that his arms are being controlled by Ethernet
cables tied to both wrists and connected to a crank As the
cable is stretched tighter Carver’s body rises and his arms
spread wider and wider

Coming to Carver begins to moan turning his head from side
to side Owen walks out from behind the table He kneels
opens a tool box and removes a metal tool meant to scrape
paint from window panes

From a tiny cardboard sheath Owen slips out a double-edged
razor blade and slips it into the tool

EXT MARSHS BACKYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON

A PACK OF CHILDREN swarm and scatter laughing and screaming
with delight spraying each other with SQUIRT GUNS

At a PICNIC TABLE PARENTS chat eating hotdogs and burgers
sipping beers Marsh holding a beer stands alone watching
as the sun bleeds below the tree line

She turns and sees Annie happily squealing backed against a
flower bed drenched by her friends Marsh looks over and
sees Griffin manning the grill

Griffin glances at Marsh and their eyes click like billiard
balls They share a smile It’s interrupted by--

BOX (0C)
Hey there

Box stands there looking a bit self-conscious overdressed
holding a bouquet of flowers A dab of bloody Kleenex is
stuck to his neck

MARSH
You made it

BOX
Barely

MARSH
(re the flowers)
You gonna give me those or make me
pry ‘em out of your cold dead
hands

BOX

(dryly)
Surprise

She takes them She sees Griffin looking over watching
Stella too Great Then as Marsh reflexively inhales the
flowers Annie runs over--

ANNIE
Mommy can I smell them too

MARSH
Sure Bug

She scoops her up onto the bench Annie inhales them

MARSH (contd)
John this is my daughter Annie

BOX
Hi Annie

ANNIE
Hello John

As before a subtle look of recognition comes over Box He
smiles warmly at her

BOX
You must be aboutummmsix and
three quarters I’1l bet

ANNIE
(delighted)
How did you know that

Marsh is curious too and a bit uneasy but before Box can
answer her Treo vibrates She checks it Her face changes
She and Box meet eyes She answers it--

MARSH
Marsh

As she listens she stands up her eyes filling with alarm

She quickly looks over at Griffin He’s noticed the moment
He quickly crosses over and whispers in Stella’s ear She
takes immediate action--

STELLA
Annie honey Come here We’re
gonna play a game

MARSH
Honey go to Grandma

Annie starts to run to her but then no fool Annie stops
dead and whips around just in time to see her mother Box
and Griffin rushing away--

ANNIE
You could at least say good-bye

Marsh whips around--

MARSH
I am so sorry baby I11 make it
up to you I promise

They hurry on but then at the gate run right into MELANIE
30 a lovely young woman carrying a bottle of wine--

MELANIE

I’m looking for Griffin He said--
(beat)

Wait that’s you Hi

Griffin grabs her by the elbow--

GRIFFIN
I am so sorry Gotta run

He races away with Marsh and Box Melanie is bewildered
She sees Annie looking up at her

ANNIE
You get used to it

INT BOX’S SPEEDING CAR -- LATER -- AFTERNOON

Box speeds along the highway with his siren attached to the
roof wailing Marsh works her laptop in the passenger seat
Griffin sits in back looking at Marsh’s screen waiting
When the image comes up Marsh and Griffin react

Box looks over as best he can while he drives On the
screen he sees Jerry Carver tied to the upright Ping-Pong
table wrestling and screaming into his gag

Into his torso killwithmecom has been cut with a razor
The delicate letters trickle blood

BOX
Sick fuckin’ bastard

MARSH
“The more that watch the faster he
drains”

INT TEENAGE BOY’S BACKYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON
A TEENAGE BOY smoking a joint lies on his hammock with an

OPEN LAPTOP COMPUTER on his lap On the other side of a
nearby fence a barbecue is in progress

The teen laughs sputtering watching a home video clip of a
kid getting hit in the bare chest by a Roman candle The
moment when the firework knocks the kid off his feet plays
over and over again in slow motion

Ping The teenager gets an Instant message Dude KWM --
back up Excited the teenager takes a hit off his joint
and clicks on the little red heart of his Favorite Places
Killwithmecom loads

When he sees Jerry Carver strapped to the table he laughs so
hard that he chokes on his smoke but then he abruptly
notices something unbelievable He puts his nose right up to
the screen to be sure No way He flies out of the hammock
almost dropping his laptop and rushes over to the fence--

INT TASK FORCE COMMAND CENTER -- RIVERTON -- LATER

her laptop

BOX

PETERSON 30’s a DEPUTY SHERIFF enters a bit winded--

PETERSON (0S)
Jerry Carver

GRIFFIN
Right A reporter

Peterson hands over a headshot from the C-Span website

PETERSON
Until last year when he moved to
DC to host a show for C-Span He
visited his mother this morning in
Silver Springs Then he was
supposed to take a look at an
antique train set he wanted to buy
and be home by noon for a family
cookout He never showed At half
past one the neighbor’s kid called
and said Jerry was being and I
quote “crucified on a Ping-Pong
table”

Brooks enters starting to unwind a bit He walks over to
the screen

BROOKS
Now how on earth is he going to
control this man’s time of death
He’s threatening to drain him
How Those are no deeper than
paper cuts

Marsh swings her chair away from her computer screen

MARSH
It’s not the cuts It’s his blood

She screen-captures the IV bag hanging above Carvers head
as well as a small metal box through which its contents pass
on their way to Carver’s chest

MARSH (cont’d)
This box regulates the amount of
the solution flowing into Carver
See the cable
(MORE )

MARSH(contd)
It’s connected to his computer

Which means he has complete control
over the dosage

BROOKS
Dosage of what

She screen-captures Carver’s agonized features and magnifies
them

MARSH
His nose is starting to bleed I’m
guessing the bag contains some sort
of anti-coagulant

BOX
(eyes on the screen)
So the more people who visit the
site the more drug is released
and the faster Carver bleeds

MARSH
Yup
BROOKS
Wonderful
PETERSON

(studying the counter)
The numbers of viewers is moving
slower than last time Is there
any chance people are losing

interest
BOX
No they’re just more interested in
fireworks
MARSH
For now
BROOKS

Well it’s high time we talked some
sense to them

Marsh throws an alarmed look at Brooks as he picks up a
telephone

INT BALTIMORE CITY HALL CORRIDOR -- EARLY EVENING

The Task Force hurries down the hall Marsh has managed to
get up alongside Brooks--

MARSH
But this is exactly what he wants
Anything we say any publicity
helps him

BROOKS
Well see about that

Before she can protest Brooks bursts through doors into--
INT BALTIMORE CITY HALL PRESS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Marsh tries to regain his attention--

MARSH
Please just hear me out

Too late Brooks is greeted by colleagues and associates
The rest of the Task Force enters around her

INT BALTIMORE CITY HALL PRESS ROOM -- LATER -- AFTERNOON

Under the glaring lights of media cameras Chief of Police
Beckett speaks at a lectern to a room packed with national
press--

CHIEF BECKETT
We’re gathered here to share some
information in regard to criminal
conduct that has originated in the
Baltimore metropolitan area but
which has far-reaching implica-
tions

ANGLE ON BOX AND BROOKS standing at Beckett’s side They
hear clicking They look over and sees Marsh seated click-
ing away at her laptop

CHIEF BECKETT (contd)
Because of the uniqueness of the
crimes and because the FBI is able
to provide resources critical to
this investigation I have asked
them to lead the inter-agency task
force assigned to the case

BACK TO MARSH who studies killwithmecom The Viewer
counter is still fairly low -- 5406000 The Estimated Time
Of Death is still at over 11 hours

The blood from the letters cut in Carver’s chest and from his
nose runs faster He still struggles to free himself

Marsh screen-captures and magnifies a detail off the site
It’s the killer’s muted TV showing Beckett’s face live at
the press conference perfectly in sync with the words we are
hearing in the background

CHIEF BECKETT (0S) (contd)
Now let me turn it over to Special
Agent in Charge of the FBIS
Cybercrime Division -- Wynn Brooks

BACK TO SCENE as Marsh goes back to her full screen and
Brooks grim-faced steps to the microphone

BROOKS
Thanks Chief

(beat)
Two weeks ago a man was killed in
cold blood on the Internet This
sadistic murder streamed live was
facilitated by individuals who
visited the killer’s website
believing no doubt that what they
were watching was a mere stunt

(beat)
I can assure you that it wasn’t

ANGLE ON MARSH staring at her computer screen Her eyes
react as the Viewer counter begins to fly upward at a much
faster rate

BROOKS (0S) (contd)
Now today a second individual has
been taken hostage and his life
too is in jeopardy

The counter moves even faster Marsh looks over at Box her
eyes urgent Box sees the screen looks over at Brooks
Decides whether to intervene With every word Brooks says
the Viewer counter spins faster--

BROOKS (contd)
Mr Carver is known to many of you
But he is more than a distinguished
reporter he is also a doting
father to two sons Eric and
Jessea loving husband to his
wife Louisea devoted son to his
mother Beatrice This is not a
hoax Not a video game It’s
real All-too-real Any visit to
this siteto this criminal
enterprisewill hasten the demise
of Mr Carver something that none
of us could possibly wish for

Brooks clearly feels that he has accomplished something He
looks down and sees Marsh’s screen His face twists with
disbelief

The Viewer counter spins wildly Blood pours down from the
letters on Carver’s chest Carver screams as the swelling
and pain builds Brooks shaken looks at Marsh then back
at the press then at the camera--

BROOKS (contd)
Your government is asking you to
say away from this website And to
spread the word to your family
friends and neighbors

Marsh watches in horror as on the screen IN SLOW MOTION
Carver arches his back and screams into his gag Blood
squirts from his eyes and runs down his cheeks

REAL-TIME Marsh gasps Brooks looks sees the nightmare
and is at a complete loss

Seeing the look on his face the Press begins to murmur and
grow uneasy Box unable to help himself leans down to the
microphone--

BOX
If you visit the siteyou’re an
accessory to murder You may not
believe it but it’s the truth
You’re his murder weapon

Marsh stares in horror as ON THE SCREEN Carver looks as
though he will explode He is in absolute agony flopping
like a fish on a line

Blood pours down his chest and from his ears eyes mouth
nose He arches his back and lets out a final muted scream

Abruptly it explodes into GUT-WRENCHING SOUND which we can
only hear because now we are in--

INT OWEN’S BASEMENT -- SAME -- EVENING

Suddenly Carver slumps too weak even to lift his head His
bleary bloody eyes slowly rise and stare at us

An accusation
Suddenly a lightning-fast MONTAGE starts flashing around

the country from COMPUTER TO COMPUTER showing the vast
spectrum of people watching Carver

It includes people from every walk of life of every age
class and race some are tearful some morbidly fascinated
some disgusted others laugh

FINALLY WE LAND ON ANOTHER ANGLE and we see that Carver
isn’t staring at us He’s staring at Owen who moving behind
the blinking camera calmly adjusts one of his lights

Carvers bloody gag slips a few inches Surprised seeing a
glimmer of hope Carver works his tongue trying to make it
fall farther But then a fresh wave of pain hits him and his
pants are suddenly drenched with blood

INT CITY HALL CONFERENCE ROOM -- LATER

The Task Force surrounds Marsh who sits at a City Hall desk
with her laptop

BECKETT
Good God

GRIFFIN
His lips are moving

Marsh screen-captures and magnifies Carver’s mouth The gag
has fallen farther We can see his lips Marsh barks at
Griffin--

MARSH
Get Tim on the phone Tim Wilks

(to all)

His gag slipped He’s trying to
tell us something

Griffin hands Marsh the phone--
MARSH (contd)
(into the phone)

mother’s nursing home

WILKS (0S)

He’s trying again

Everyone turns to look at Carver on the screen but almost
immediately he vomits what looks like coffee grounds all
over himself and then a moment later like a giant spider
a hand appears over the lens holding a lens cap and the
screen goes black

MARSH
Shit

BECKETT
Let’s get him

As everyone rushes out of frame HOLD ON THE SCREEN

The Viewer counter reads 7610000 The Estimated Time Of
Death is over 5 hours 25 minutes

INT MIDDLE-CLASS HOME -- MOMENTS LATER -- DUSK

in weapons drawn They see no one They race through the

It took less than six hours

BOX
Twice as fast as Miller

GRIFFIN
And that’s on a holiday

MARSH
(half to herself)
And none of the people who killed
him think they did anything wrong

They just visited a website like

Or watch a skateboarder break his
arm A pedestrian get run over

innocent journalist get beheaded

Box shakes his head appalled--

BOX
When did the world go fuckin’
insane I use my computer to send
mail and get sports scores

Marsh smiles at Griffin--

MARSH
He’s been hiding in the field too
long

Griffin looks meaningfully at Box and points to the laptop--

GRIFFIN
It’s a jungle in there

The point lands Then slowly Marsh looks around thinking
piecing it together--

MARSH
Carver gave us this address because
this is where he was captured He
was moved later but he didn’t know
it

EXT MIDDLE-CLASS HOME -- MINUTES LATER -- NIGHT

Box strides across the yard covering his cell phone and
muttering to ONE OF HIS MEN as it’s being cordoned off with
yellow evidence tape

BOX
I want this place scrubbed I don’t
care if it’s fucking soy sauce I
want every drop every fibre ID’ed
And find his god-damn car

The cop nods and walks off Box returns to his phone call--

FIND MARSH standing on the perimeter of the activity at the
sidewalk thinking looking up and down the block

Gradually she sees something that catches her attention
Across the street sits a Volkswagen bus She frowns and
starts to walk over to it

FOLLOW MARSH getting closer and closer to it when--

BOX (0S) (contd)
Jennifer

She turns There’s Box pocketing his phone and approaching
with his notebook She meets him half way

In the background we see NEIGHBORS held back by police tape
Among them is Owen chatting quietly with neighbors his eyes
never leaving Marsh

When Marsh reaches Box--

BOX (cont’d)
Carvers wife says he was contacted
about the train set through the C-
Span website In his bio he
mentions he’s a collector She’s
trying to find the e-mail

MARSH
It’ll trace to a dead server Who
owns the house

BOX

now he’s visiting his mother for
her birthday In South Korea

MARSH
Who would know that

BOX
Only a few thousand people Park
owns a local market He closes it
down for two weeks every July so he
can make the trip

MARSH
Our guy must be a customer
BOX
Well see what Park can tell us
Meanwhile we’ll conduct a “neigh-

Box leans against the building smoking sipping coffee
reading The Washington Post She walks over He shows her
the article he’s reading It bears a handsome professional
headshot of Carver

BOX
They condemn the site refuse to
publish its name then they mention
that it’s all over the Web and that
an eight year old could find it

Box flips his cigarette and moves

As he and Marsh enter the building he drops the newspaper in
the trash

OFF THE NEWSPAPER headshot of Jerry Carver--
DISSOLVE TO THE REAL JERRY CARVER hanging dead from the Ping-
Pong table crusted black with dried blood Flies swarm in

celebration

Behind him the Viewer counter flies past 31000000

THE CAMERA MOVES OVER to reveal Owen oblivious to the
horror sitting at a work table hunched over his computer

CLOSE ON HIS COMPUTER SCREEN filled with mundane folders
His cursor moves from folder to folder deciding which one to
open It stops on “Photos”

Click A long list JPEG FILES opens The cursor moves to
one marked “Drunk Me” Click

A COLOR PHOTO OF MARSH opens showing her years ago laughing
at a bar with her pals from Quantico

Owen closes it Moves his cursor down the list Stops on
one marked “Mom” A photo opens of Stella beaming with
happiness feeding Annie as a two-year-old

Owen closes it Moves his cursor Stops on another photo
and clicks A photo of Annie opens as we know her today
grinning and adorable on a playground swing

Owen stares at it for a long long time

INT ASCENDING ELEVATOR -- MINUTE LATER -- MORNING

Marsh and Box are alone in the elevator Their eyes meet in

separating their reflections

INT TASK FORCE COMMAND CENTER -- LATER -- MORNING

The room is crowded with LOCAL AGENTS setting up a more
complex command center A huge map of the area covers one
wall More computers have been brought in

On one large plasma screen we see Carver’s dead body with
the Viewer counter spinning past 38000000 Box and Marsh
enter and look around at all the activity Griffin walks
over excited speaking under his breath-

GRIFFIN
Brooks finally made it a special
and he brought in the profiler you
asked for Two in fact

MARSH
It’s about time

BOX
What’s a special

GRIFFIN
When we transfer agents from other
divisions to cover our regular
cases so our agents who know the
area can join the task force

MARSH
What woke him up

GRIFFIN
A phone call from the Director
Who got one from the Secretary of
Homeland Security Whose niece
used to date Jerry Carver’s son

Marsh has to smile at the absurdity

MARSH
I guess all politics is local

INT TASK FORCE COMMAND CENTER -- LATER -- DAYS LATER

Marsh Box and Griffin sit with TWO DOZEN OTHER OFFICERS
some uniformed some not from a variety of agencies
listening to FBI profiler HANK DAIGLE 55 burly crusty
genial--

DAIGLE
Well the son of a bitch knows his
way around a computer He knows
something about medicine too Is
he a psychopath To some extent
sure No conscience Sees other
people as articlesobjectsto
be controlled with violence He’s
probably on the younger side too
Might already have served some jail
time

His partner MIKE INMAN late 30’s a straighter arrow joins
in--

INMAN
But in real life mental disorders
dont come in tidy packages They
overlap sometimes which is what I
think we’re looking at here The
lack of a sexual component for
example -- that’s abnormal for
psychopaths So is his mastery of
computers Psychopaths lack the
focus to excel at much of anything
So my guess is the subject’s got
paranoid tendencies as well
Which would make him a less social
individual more likely to withdraw
into cyberspace and--

BOX
What do you think the piece of
shit’s trying to say with these
killings

People are surprised by the interruption and some are
confused by the question Not Marsh

DAIGLE
Sounds like you’ve got a theory

Box takes a beat to order his thoughts As he speaks Marsh
becomes increasingly interested in and impressed by what he
has to say

BOX

There’re plenty of ways to kill
Our guy invites the public to join
in The American public No
foreigners allowed And he invites
them to kill who Fellow
Americans Good citizens That
plus the cartoon the music -- if
you ask me it shows contempt not
just for the victim but for every-
one who watchesall his helpers
He reminds me of the Unabombera
paranoid with delusions of grandeur
using violence to critique
society In other words a fuckin’
terrorist Except what this one’s
trying to say I’m not sure Guess
Ill have to wait and read his
manifesto

(beat)
That make any sense

INMAN
It does and I’1l answer with a
question Society’s been around a
long time Why did the subject
start attacking it now Start
killing now I’d be on the lookout
for an inciting event something
personal in a suspect’s life that
might have set him off

Marsh takes this in
INT CYBER DIVISION HALLWAY -- LATER -- DAY

As the meeting adjourns Task Force members fill the hallway

gamedumps his body in a

probably choke to death with apple
pie

Menacing rock accompanies a fast grisly one-minute montage
of car accidents police shootings street fights

Before the man pulls the trigger Marsh grabs Griffin’s mouse
and stops the movie

MARSH

the cat is in the window

Annie not sure how this could be climbs up on the chair and
turns the monitor toward the window

Then she walks over to the window pushes aside the cat and
waves her hand She looks over at the monitor and sees
herself waving on the screen

Delighted she walks to the open bathroom door Over her
shoulder we see the outline in the plastic curtain of Marsh
showering

Suddenly a noise from behind her The front door knob being

As she gets closer the knob continues to jiggle Stella

for her to get back and be silent

Marsh chest heaving grabs the door knob Marsh swings the

On the verge of tears chin trembling she says--

Annie a little forlorn waving good-bye from the back of a
black Bureau car as it drives away

BOX
What are you waiting for Go with

(off her look)
No one would blame you

MARSH
I might Keeping my family safe
while the Carvers are pouring Jerry
into the ground

BOX
You’ve sacrificed enough

She throws him a curious look She isn’t sure what he means
He’s tired of pretending--

BOX (cont’d)
I told you I remembered you from
Rick’s funeral Well when I saw
Annie it didn’t take me long to
figure out who her father was

Marsh stares at him revealing nothing

BOX (cont’d)
I don’t blame you for working
behind a desk Losing one parent
is enough for any kid And now
that the piece of shit’s camping
out on your front lawn Id say
it’s time for you to get lost and
stay lost till we’ve got him

GRIFFIN

MARSH
Yeah

GRIFFIN

So you wanna hear my theory about

Because there is a connection
between him and Kinross and
somehow he knows you’re onto it
and he wants to drive you off the

case

even threw in the house where the cat

was stolen Here’s a 3-D image of
what we call the “jeopardy surface”

Marsh takes a look at his screen--

He hits a computer key The screen fills with the 3-D image
of a high mountain The top is wide flat and red The
slope descends into different colors

It’s the best we can do for now
Id concentrate my resources there

Pretty big area

BOX (0S)
Make it four

They turn Box stands in the doorway staring at the large
plasma screen They look too Every agent in the room
slowly converges on the screen

It’s not a film -- yet Just a series of FLASHING STILLS
disjointed images of a man naked but for boxers bound and
gagged wrapped in Ethernet cable He is tied to a folded
ironing board and fastened to pipes running along the
ceiling

BOX (cont’d)
Why’s it doing that

MARSH
It just started streaming There
aren’t enough viewers yet to make a
continuous image The mosaic’s still
forming

They watch as the flashing stills begin to integrate and form
a continuous moving image and when it does everyone reacts
with horror

The victim is Griffin surrounded by a three-sided aluminum
pen His FBI BADGE is pinned right through the skin of his
bare chest

The Viewer counter is only at 12400 and the ETOD is at just
under 24 hours but both counters spin with blinding speed

A text crawl appears The more that watch the faster he’s
strippedThe more that watch the faster he’s stripped
The more that watch the faster he’s stripped

BOX
Stripped What does that mean

Marsh lunges at the keyboard She screen-captures a detail
and magnifies it It’s Griffin’s leg and there are three
tiny specks crawling up his calf Her face unhinges She
can hardly breathe

INT TASK FORCE COMMAND CENTER -- MINUTES LATER -- DAY

Brooks Box Wilks Peterson and the other agents sit
watching helplessly as Griffin writhes and screams into his
gag Marsh works her computer like a madwoman

Finally she hits a button and a clinical specimen of a RED
FIRE ANT fills a screen She spins her chair and talks to
the group--

MARSH
It’s a Brazilian fire antfound
in the southFloridaGeorgia
Very aggressive A few research
labs sell them but only to buyers
with academic credentials

INT OWEN’S BASEMENT -- AFTERNOON

FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF ANTS across the cement floor and up
Griffin’s leg stomach chest as they bite and chew their
way

Finally as the trail grows more sparse we reach Griffins
face His eyes and veins bulge as he writhes in pain
screaming and moaning

Right in front of him the VIDEO CAMERA sits on a metal box
(the contraption we saw Owen tinkering with earlier)
attached by cables to his computers

Owen stands behind the box speaking matter-of-factly
ignoring the screams Behind him we see the Viewer counter
spinning wildly past 3000000

OWEN

If no one was watching right now
there wouldn’t be any ants We’d
just be talking But people enjoy
the suffering of others They
really do In the old days they
watched gladiators kill each other
And later people were hanged in
public Or had their heads cut
off All of it was enormously
popular

(MORE )

OWEN (contd)
Then for some reason people started
to think that we’d evolved Become
civilized But it’s not true I
know

As the Viewer counter flies past 4000000 a door on the box
starts to lift

OWEN (contd)
See See how excited they are to
see you die

FIRE ANTS come crawling out joining the exodus leading to
Griffin He screams louder bucking and writhing After a
few long seconds the door lowers cutting off the ants

OWEN (contd)
I like you Griffin Jennifer too
Youre both really intelligent
Especially Jenniferno offense So
it’s not personal I’m only doing to
you what your friends will do to me
when they catch me Only they’1ll use
Potassium Chloride and they won’t
let very many people watch Even
though almost everybody will want to

(beat)

Oh wow

As the Viewer counter flies past 4500000 the door starts
to lift Griffin screams into his gag Owen shakes his
head

OWEN (contd)
So much faster this time Word of
mouth I guess
(beat)
Or maybe it’s because you’re wearing
your badge

INT TASK FORCE COMMAND CENTER -- LATER -- DAY

The Task Force sits and stands paralyzed before the
monitors The counters spin so quickly that action is
impossible

Among the group Marsh sits watching in agony helpless as
Griffin screams and writhes his limbs and torso thick with
ants She can’t take it an instant longer She jumps up and
races out of the room

INT CYBER DIVISION HALLWAY -- LATER -- DAY

Marsh runs down the hall as though being pursued
INT CYBER DIVISION BATHROOM -- LATER -- DAY

The door bangs open Marsh enters sucking wind She leans
down on the sink breathing hard looking as though she might

puke

Gradually her breathing slows She starts to cry But stops

herself She turns on the tap Splashes her face with

water She looks up into the mirror directly into her own

anguished eyes

Suddenly they ignite with an idea

INT TASK FORCE COMMAND CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER
Marsh explodes into the room--

a madwoman--

US Coast Guard retired Miss
Marsh
She leads quickly him to a chair
MARSH
Griffin is telling us something

With his eyes What’s he saying

Ray is absolutely horrified by the sight of Griffin He

stares slack-jawed Marsh practically jams him into his

chair then slams a legal pad and pen down in front of him

MARSH (cont’d)
Hurry

The Viewer counter spins past 7750000 The ants reach
Griffin’s mouth He presses his lips shut marshaling his
will to continue his blinking

Ray trembles can’t focus or speak Realizing it’s too much
for him Marsh screen-captures Griffin’s eyes and magnifies
them hugely They take up the whole screen now

MARSH (contd)
Do it

Everyone waits as Ray squints--

GUARD
The right eye is dotsthe left is
dashes

He slowly writes out the dashes and dots across the piece of
paper

Marsh hits a keyboard at her side and on a smaller side
monitor brings up the full image of Griffin The Viewer
counter has gone berserk flying past 9000000

Suddenly on the huge plasma screen an ant appears crawling
into one of Griffin’s eyes At this level of magnification
it is colossal

Griffin tries to keep blinking but soon another ant appears
then another digging in their pincers The lid closes but
they continue biting chewing

On the smaller monitor Griffin covered from head to toe
flails in his chair in his last frantic death throes The
counter flies toward 10000000

The emoticon begins to strut across the bottom of the screen

MARSH
Turn it off
(screaming)
TURN IT OFF

The agents obey One by one the monitors go black No one
knows what to say or do The silence is broken by the
vibration of Marsh’s Treo

Marsh grabs it and is about to shut if off when she notices
something chilling She hits some buttons

The screen reads AWGTHTDTAOAAWGTHTDTAOAAWGTHTDTAOA
-AWGTHTDTAOA And beneath it the killer’s emoticon
moving back and forth

MARSH (contd)
It’s fromfrom him

Everyone reacts with fear and bewilderment

MARSH
Are We Going To Have To Do This All
Over Again

Silence Marsh walks to the door She turns back to Ray

MARSH (contd)
What was he trying to tell us

The Guard turns his legal pad around and shows it to Marsh
He has written I-C-I-D-E-S-U A pause as people try to
understand

MARSH (contd)
“Suicide”

He was saying it again when

Marsh nods then exits Box looks over at Brooks Everyone
is speechless

INT MOTEL ROOM -- SAME -- NIGHT

Marsh sits on the bed absolutely motionless Outside we
hear the white noise of distant traffic On the other bed
her cat sits on the pillow staring at her

A KNOCK on the door Marsh’s head turns slowly toward it
She rises slowly Walks to her dresser where her weapon
sits She picks it up

MARSH
Who is it

BOX (0C)
Me

Marsh’s eyes fall to her reflection in the dresser mirror
She’s a mess She sets down her weapon and walks to the
door Opens it

MARSH
What do you--

Marsh stares numbly as he eases her aside and walks right
past her He carries a bag of take-out food

BOX
Get in the shower

For a moment her eyes flicker with defiance then they go
dull again and she obediently drifts into the bathroom

Box enters grabs a clean towel and pulls aside the shower
curtain Obscured by steam Marsh sits huddled holding
herself on the shower floor

Box shuts off the water pulls her to her feet wraps her in
the towel then pulls her into his arms The dam breaks
She weeps in his arms her body convulsing He leans back
against the door holding her letting her cry and cry

INT MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT

Marsh wearing boxers and a T-shirt sits up cross-legged
with her back against the headboard eating dinner She is a
bit restored but only a shadow of her former self

Box stands at the open door smoking a cigarette blowing the
smoke outside

BOX

We found Griffin’s car parked on
the I-50 overpass His skeleton
was in the trunk

(beat)
The ants we traced to a research
lab at Marshall Junior College
The thief knew his way around and
didn’t leave a print

(beat)
Looks like Griffin was baited with
a phone call

(MORE )

BOX (cont d)
But we can’t trace it because it

was made with aa spoof card I
guess it’s called

MARSH
Private investigators use them for
pretext calls It’s really just a
phone card costs about twenty
bucks an hour It lets you program
any caller ID you want

BOX
It still doesn’t explain how he got
him to--
MARSH

Spoof cards also let you change the
gender of your voice It comes
with the service He knew where
Griffin was vulnerable He baited
him as an internet date

BOX
Howd he know anything about him
How did he even get his phone
number

MARSH
The same way he got mine And my
home address The night Miller
died we were trying to trace him
and he routed us back to our own
network He followed us in A few
seconds later I got a text
message

She picks up her Treo and scrolls back

MARSH (contd)
A bunch of random numbers

She hands it to him He looks at the field of random
numbers

MARSH (cont’d)
Or so I thought
(beat)
Turn it over

Box does In the middle of the field the upsidedown numbers
spell out “Hello Hello Hello”

BOX
How’d he do it

MARSH
Before Internal Ops purged him he
had a few seconds to access my
personal devices Griffin’s too
For weeks he’s had access to every
one of our keystrokes

A somber silence

BOX
Has he contacted you again

MARSH
He has no reason to He wants me
off the case I’m off the case

Box flicks his cigarette and closes the door

BOX
Any idea why Griffin was blinking
“suicide” A few of us have ideas
but

MARSH
John II’m finished Tomorrow
I’m gonna pick up my mom and Annie
and justI’1ll take themwe’ll
disappeartill it’s over

Their eyes meet Hold Marsh looks away

MARSH (contd)

Ill be fine You can go home now
BOX
Nope
MARSH

(finding a smile)
Never

He just stares She lowers her eyes and speaks almost
inaudibly--

MARSH (cont’d)
I’m good at a lot of things but
not losing people I’m bad at
losing people

A tear trickles down her cheek He leans over gently wipes
it away Her smile is sweet grateful

INT MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- DAWN

Under the covers bathed in slanting light from the blinds
Box lies on his side sound asleep holding Marsh naked in
his arms

ANOTHER ANGLE Marsh is awake Feeling protected she is
calmer now Her eyes drift over to the laptop computer
sitting on the other bed

Her mind starts to work

She gently removes Box’s arm from around her and slips out
She throws on a T-shirt then walks over sits on the bed
and opens her computer

For a moment she just stares at the screen Then she pulls
from a pouch in her computer case the Kinross disc that
Griffin gave her She inserts it into her machine

After it loads she clicks open a long list of titled video
clip files Into a search box she types the word “Suicide”

She clicks on the first found item “Suicide Jump” A video
clip plays of a young woman perched atop the roof of an
apartment building Marsh lowers the volume

Rescuers reach out to the young woman Frightened she pulls
away Slips and falls She tumbles out of frame to her
death

Marsh closes the file She clicks opens the next one marked
“Kurt Suicide” It’s an old news clip of Kurt Cobain
discussing suicide

She closes it and clicks opens the next one “Suicide Mayor”
A small-town mayor addresses a press conference Without
warning he lifts a revolver to his mouth pulls the trigger
and falls his head spouting blood

A beat then Marsh open the next file “Rush-Hour Suicide”
As it plays

ANGLE ON BOX lying on his side in bed petting Marsh’s cat
watching Marsh work She’s beautiful in the early morning
light

We hear the scratchy sound of a TRAFFIC HELICOPTER REPORTER
coming from Marsh’s computer but Box cannot see what she is
watching--

Every suicide is a tragedy for the
survivors but this was far worse
because it was broadcast live on
the 5 o’clock news Kids home from
school saw it Outraged parents

apologized Except channel 9
Theyd been having trouble in the
ratingsbut not that afternoon
The numbers were sky-high

MARSH (cont’d)

Five years ago that would have
been the end of it But the
world’s changed Within a few
minutes of Channel 9 airing the
footage for the last time Andrew
Kinross had pulled it off his TiVo
and posted it on five different
shock-video sites From there
Cleary’s suicide was public domain
The worst pain a family can endure
had become something for a billion
strangers to feed on laugh at
turn away from gossip about

(beat)
But Cleary didn’t have much family
Just a son that he and his wife had
rescued out of foster care Owen
was a brilliant kid good with
mechanicselectronics
computers But he was troubled
frail withdrawn He worked as a
freelance programmer Out of his
basement

(beat)
Owen adored his father To be
confronted with his terrible death
again and again was more than his
psyche could withstand

MARSH(contd)
He began hacking into sites that
offered the clip and leaving
violent threats lashing out at
the uncaring mob that had turned
his personal loss into a sideshow
attraction He was eventually
hospitalized Put on suicide watch
himself

(beat)

Six months ago Owen was released
He lives alone now in his
father’s house in Silver Springs

Click A photo of Owen fills the screen
MARSH (cont’d)

minutes
Marsh glances at Box

Here’s what I want you to do
Nothing Relax Take some time

emotion--

MARSH

people had watched the ants clean
his bones than fought in World War
II The next victim will die in
the blink of an eye And you want
me to go lie on a fucking beach

BROOKS

I don’t care if it’s a beach or a

But don’t you worry When you get

Where’s the sound coming from The bathroom She walks
over quickly kicks open the door Nothing in sight She
reaches in and throws aside the shower curtain Nothing

She relaxes but then she hears the sound again She turns
around tensed and realizes it’s coming from the closet
She walks over crouches and quickly yanks the folding door

Her cat bounds out Marsh chest heaving catches her
breath snaps shut her holster

Tired of the classical music she hits buttons until she

--six long days since the murder of
Federal Agent Griffin Dowd and
still no suspect in custody Some
wonder who this madman will seize
next Not I I wonder when we’1l
stop this diabolical collaboration
not with the killer but with the
alternate universe that he
inhabits The one inside our
computers A world without
compassion or conscience Without
laws morality or shame Why do
we love this world so Why did we
create it

There are commotion and distress in Marsh eyes

RADIO EDITORIAL (contd)
Does it reflect who we are as a
species What we have become
What must our Creator think of us

Marsh sees the sign saying “Welcome to Pennsylvania” She
can’t do it She yanks the wheel and roars onto exit

She zooms up the exit ramp and at the top pulls a hard left
and roars along the overpass

She reaches a red light sees that the coast is clear and
runs the red light yanking another left

She roars down an entrance ramp
EXT HIGHWAY -- MOMENTS LATER -- RAINY NIGHT

Marsh’s SUV streaks past the sign saying “Welcome to

INT MARSH’S SUV -- LATER -- RAINY NIGHT

Marsh listens to music again The rain is falling harder
now A flash of lightning and then a roar of thunder Her
cat meows mournfully She looks over and opens the cage
door It sticks its head out and she scratches it

MARSH
I know baby I know -- that’s a
lotta water

Suddenly the music stops dead Odd Marsh adjusts the
radio Hits buttons Nothing

Then suddenly the wipers stop She reacts skids a bit hits
the brakes The cat leaps out of its cage Cars honk

Madly working the wiper controls she struggles to see
through the windshield

Suddenly the headlights go out and her car lurches
violently The engine is dead Cars barrel past her
honking their horns She jams the car in neutral and
wrestles with the stiff power steering

A TRACTOR TRAILER blaring its horn bears down on her and
swerves skids nearly plowing into her

Finally Marsh wrenches the car to a stop in the gravel of
the shoulder

Chest heaving gasping to catch her breath she sits there in
the dark grateful to be alive Her cat sits cowering in
the foot-well of the passenger seat

Abruptly she snaps to reaching for her Treo hits her speed-
dial The Treo beeps She looks at the screen “Service
denied”

Spooked she looks out and through the rain spots an
illuminated CALL BOX about fifty yards away She pulls the
door handle but the doors are locked Won’t unlock

OWEN (0S)
Hello Jennifer

With a gasp Marsh yanks out her weapon and points it into
the back Nothing No one The cat makes a sound

Slowly very slowly heart pounding she inches her eyes up
to the NorthStar speaker above her head

For a moment just the sound of two people breathing in the
dark And the sounds of the storm

OWEN (contd)

I can hear you You’re not dead

Look out the passenger window

(she doesn’t)
Under that streetlight that’s
where my dad’s body landed after he
killed himself Some websites show
the whole thing in slow-motion
because it’s so much better that
way One archives it in a section
called “Whoa” That’s all Just
“Whoa”

The breathing stops

tries the door Locked Fuck it She has no choice

Shaking her head at their stupidity she walks on then stops
dead Her car’s headlights are on She starts to run

Marsh freezes looks up slowly ever so slowly at the
Northstar

Then from the shadows of the back seat Owen rises up
sopping wet and touches his Taser to her cheek Marsh
screams and spasms and falls

DARKNESS

FLASH Marsh hands and feet bound with Ethernet cable and
her mouth gagged is being dragged by her hair across a
cement floor

As she is brutally dragged up two stairs she sees the spot
on the wall where a lawn mower hangs -- its dirty outline
visible on the wall -- but it’s not there

Abruptly she realizes that it’s her own garage She screams
into her gag kicking wriggling resisting with all her
might

Owen drops her to the floor Her head cracks against the
cement Blood drips from her scalp Owen’s shadow lengthens
across her body Her eyes beg him not to hurt her He
touches the Taser to her face

DARKNESS
FLASH
INT MARSH’S BASEMENT -- LATER -- RAINY NIGHT

Marsh’s eyes open to pure horror as she tumbles down the
steps with Owen descending behind her She hits the cement
bottom bloody and unconscious

DARKNESS
FLASH

Marsh’s eyes open Bleeding from the mouth and head she
sees sound-proofing panels on the windows

Marsh tries to free herself Owen ten feet away toting
something regards her with his dull eyes

He sets down what he’s carrying then removes his Taser from
his belt and shoots her Twin probes bearing fish hooks
fly out of the gun and hit her squarely in the chest

DARKNESS
FLASH

Marsh’s eyes open The cable around her ankles is connected
to a long chain that Owen has tossed over a sewage pipe
running along the ceiling

She follows the longer chain with her eyes It travels down
from the pipe and connects to the rusty iron spool of a
garden hose Owen has fastened a crank to the spool He
turns it with great effort Lying on the floor at his side
is her Glock

Marsh dazed doesn’t understand why but then slowly her
feet begin to rise off the cement floor

Frantic as she rises higher upside down she looks and sees
flashing computer equipment everywhere In the other
direction her eyes bulge when she sees a video camera

She wrestles violently shaking the chains making the pipe
overhead pull on its supports Owen doesn’t like the look of
those supports

He stops his work and presses the trigger of his Taser She
spasms screams and stops struggling

DARKNESS

A distant sputter then a muted roar then the roar grows
louder and louder until it explodes into hideous life

FLASH

Marsh’s eyes open She is hanging upside down staring
straight down into the whirring blades of her own lawn mower
which has been rigged onto its back and attached to a fuel
pump and gas can A plastic tube attached to the engine
carries the exhaust into the open door of the dormant boiler

Eyes bugging Marsh looks over and sees the camera pointed at
her Then suddenly to her horror its red light pops on

Wilks turns around sees nothing Goes back to his work

faster and faster until the mosaic of viewers kicks in and
it becomes a continuous moving image

As the Viewer counter shoots above 9000000 the top of

Her hair whips madly

Growling with determination she pulls herself up and down --
a swinging vertical sit-up trying to loosen the pipe
support More dust falls from the ceiling

Owen lifts the Taser to blast her one last time Suddenly
the lawn mower belches falters sputters Owen concerned
hurries over to investigate

The blades pick up speed again Owen relaxes but before he
can hit the Taser Marsh swings into the frame banging into
him not enough to hurt him but enough to knock him away
Angry he hits the Taser again

As the counter reaches 10000000 Marsh spasms wildly and is
swung past the mower The pipe-support breaks sending Marsh
crashing to the floor in a shower of debris just a foot from
the blades The debris hits the blade and flies everywhere

Owen backs away shielding his eyes He hits the Taser
again but the probes have ripped from Marsh’s clothing

Owen jams a new cartridge into his Taser and shoots Marsh
ducks and the barbed probes hit the wall

She turns her head sees her Glock lying on the floor She
makes a dash Owen chases her with his Taser which because
its probes have been thrown must be touched to her body

Marsh falls to the floor and the gun slides away from her
grasp

She lunges for it just as Owen drives the Taser into the
back of her neck She spasms incapacitated but somehow
manages to roll onto her back

Owen looks down at her Frowns Her paralyzed hands hold
the Glock She whimpers unable even to pull the trigger

He smiles and reaches down for the gun In a burst of
agonized will and determination she screams and shoots him
in the chest

Owen staggers back shocked more than anything else In
terrible pain she manages to pull the gag from her mouth--

MARSH
Down on the floor Get down

Owen recovers a bit then lunges forward Marsh shoots him
over and over again driving him back across the basement

Owen trips over Marsh’s cat spins around and lands belly
down with his full weight on the lawn mower blades He
flops as the blades chew him up flinging pieces of him in
every direction

points her gun but it’s Box racing down the steps

He freezes for a beat when he sees the entrails splattered
everywhere then he runs to her

She whimpers evades him crawls to her feet staggers over
and stops in front of Owen’s blinking camera

Wrists still bound she grabs her FBI badge and holds it up
