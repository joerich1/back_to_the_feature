A text crawl sets the stage for an epic tale to unfold

WEST AFRICA 1823

The African Kingdom of Dahomey is
at a crossroads A new king Ghezo
has taken power just as his enemy
the powerful Oyo Empire begins to
kidnap and sell his people to the
European slave ships The Oyo army
is large and powerful but the
young king has his own fearsome
weapon an elite force of female
soldiers the Agojie led by a
general Nanisca Now they are all
that stand between the Oyo and
their annihilation

INT HUT - NIGHT 1

A TEENAGE GIRL Her sweet face frozen with fear This is
FUMBE

WOMEN AND CHILDREN crammed into the small hut some with
haunted looks clothing bloody and torn Fumbe turns to a
WOUNDED WOMAN shivering her thin cloth garment wet with
fresh blood Her halting breaths whisper --

FUMBE
Mother

Her mother can barely open her eyes

MOTHER
Fumbe When the men come do not
look at them

Fumbe stares terrified at the hut’s entrance covered with
a thin fabric curtain Beyond it firelight flickers Men are
heard talking laughing

EXT HUT - SAME TIME 2

SIX MEN sit around a small fire drinking and oiling their
weapons knives hatchets machetes Behind them a small
village maybe thirty huts perch like sitting ducks on the
African plain

ONE OF THE MEN hears something His head whips to look He
gestures for silence and stands hand gripping his machete
The other men peer out at the GRASSLANDS

The bright full moon shines down The grasslands stretch off
in every direction They seem to be waving in the breeze An
IMPALA leaps up from the grass spooked disappears into the
darkness

The men make fun of their skittish comrade Return to their
drinking and laughter

A BIRD CALL ON THE MEN hearing this exchanging glances
and then AGOJIE TROOPS RISE FROM THE GRASS THIRTY
soldiers ALL WOMEN And at the forefront NANISCA A
General eyes steely her CHISELED body SCARRED from endless
battles She wears a necklace of shark’s teeth jagged and
sharp

Standing beside her her right hand AMENZA long and lithe
taut with adrenaline To her left IZOGIE a young
lieutenant with the swagger of an elite athlete her eyes
unblinking

The Guard looks at his compatriots -- they are in deep shit

NANISCA WHIPS UP HER MACHETE The female soldiers start
screaming undulating their voices in a terrifying battle
cry Eh-le-leh-m’elele THEY CHARGE

Nanisca Amenza and Izogie quickly overwhelm the Guards
swinging their machetes with more skill more speed

IN THE MAHI VILLAGE MEN half dressed rush out of their
huts with axes and picks to find they are overrun by the
Agojie tearing down doors and walls routing the occupants
These women soldiers have no fear dispatching challengers
no matter their size Ferocious unrelenting they CUT DOWN
this one slice that one The VILLAGE WOMEN huddle in terror
but are not touched by the Agojie

INT PRISONER HUT - SAME TIME 3

Fumbe hears the fighting The captive women are fearful

EXT ENEMY VILLAGE - SAME TIME 4

NANISCA grapples with a man He is strong BUT SHE AND HER
SOLDIERS OIL THEIR SKIN FOR BATTLE Nanisca’s arms and legs
are glowing slick he cannot hold her She spins away gets
behind him holds her machete to his neck
NANISCA
You challenge the King of Dahomey

VILLAGE LEADER
No We are farmers we did nothing

NANISCA
Where have you taken our people

VILLAGE LEADER
We took nothing

AMENZA
(calling Nanisca by her
title of General)
Miganon

Amenza yanks down the fabric door of the prisoner hut THE
DAHOMEY CAPTIVES stare back in fear including Fumbe holding
her mother

Nanisca’s eyes grow cold She turns back to the village
leader and SLITS HIS THROAT dropping him to the ground

EXT ENEMY VILLAGE - DAWN 5

Smoke from dying fires drifts over the grasslands Nanisca
blood smeared on her battle gear walks with Amenza through
the battered village post-battle She spots a discarded arc
of metal on the ground A CRUDE HORSESHOE which she hooks and
raises with her machete showing Amenza

NANISCA
Horses That can only be Oyo
soldiers

She frowns looking out at the casualties her warriors and
others

HER POV An Agojie warrior TARA kneels at the dead body of
one of her comrades She takes a tiny metal charm from a
small leather pouch attached to her belt She lays the charm
on the dead warrior’s forehead

Nearby the girl Fumbe hangs over her dead mother crying
A shadow falls over her NANISCA stands there weary fierce

NANISCA (CONTD)
Who is she

FUMBE
My mother
NANISCA
We will take you back to your
village Perhaps your father

FUMBE
They killed him And my brothers
They killed them all

Nanisca glowers The low sun red in the smoke rises behind
her She takes in the sight of the rescued Dahomey women
brutalized by their captors their eyes haunted and empty

Izogie walks over to Nanisca and Amenza

IZOGIE
Miganon The prisoners are ready to
march

Nanisca glares at the three surviving Guards bloodied their
hands tied with rope Behind them MAHI MEN AND WOMEN now
captives of the Agojie

NANISCA’s face is cold practical eyes falling across the
dead Agojie To Amenza and Izogie --

NANISCA
Bring me stronger warriors

EXT FARMHOUSE - EARLY MORNING 6

Out of a mud house comes a young woman NAWI -- 19 Small
skinny toughened by a life of neglect Her fingers are
working braiding her own hair She pauses in the shadows
sitting on a small stool to finish braiding before she
performs a long list of chores

AT A WELL she hoists a heavy bucket of water

She piles a cord of wood from a larger stack Wraps it ina
blanket Lifts it ONTO HER BACK Walks back to the house with
the heavy load There is no joy in her movements muscle
memory from years of hardship

She hefts a long stick in her hand throws it up into a tree
knocking its high-hanging fruit to the ground Gathers it

Takes meat from bread fruit feeds the goats

She tosses corn to the chickens enclosed in a pen

INT FARMHOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER 7

In the cooking area Nawi lights the stove fire Boils the
water Cooks porridge from the seeds Corrals two children a
girl and a boy -- LIDA AND BOTHI

EXT FARMHOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER 7A

Nawi feeds the children breakfast A plump lumbering woman
walks out from the farmhouse the children call her “Mama”
This is YDANDE

The children embrace her loving her girth She pushes a
large empty basket into Nawi’s hands regarding her coldly

YDANDE
Go to the market Nawi

EXT CITY OF ABOMEY - LATE MORNING 8

The Dahomey capital A thriving CITY with broad dirt avenues
and mud-walled buildings humming with various industry
BLACKSMITHS all men pound molten metal An open-air
REFINERY -- women boiling nuts to make palm oil Large
weaving LOOMS employ men producing fabrics there’s a POTTERY
STUDIO a BATHHOUSE a BROTHEL

EXT CITY OF ABOMEY - OPEN MARKET - SAME TIME 9

Merchants sell vegetables oils cloth chickens baskets
metal statues and fetishes beads dolls

NAWI shopping with her friend DAYO softer than she As
they pay a merchant with the local currency cowrie shells a
SHOPKEEPER calls out --

SHOPKEEPER
Nawi tell your mother to see me
for the dress

NAWI
What dress

SHOPKEEPER
Your wedding dress I will make you
beautiful Tell her

Nawi frowns as Dayo gives her a wide-eyed smile

DAYO
They have made you another match

NAWI
I don’t know what she’s talking
about

Then they hear THE SONOROUS CALL OF A CONCH SHELL Nawi
brightens for the first time

NAWI (CONTD)
They’re coming

She grabs Dayo’s hand and leads her in a run

EXT BOULEVARD IN FRONT OF THE PALACE - SHORT TIME LATER 10

Citizens of Abomey gather CHEERING SINGING across from the
Abomey palace which is surrounded by a HIGH WALL stretching
the length of the town The wall is topped with forbidding
HORNS and SKULLS grimacing at all who enter

Nawi and Dayo are in the front watching the freed Dahomey
women returning from their fight Relatives cry with joy and
RUN INTO THE ROAD hugging their mothers and daughters who
have been returned One of the female Mahi captives ODE
bound behind them watches

ON FUMBEalone in the midst of the tearful reunions There
is no family for her

Low gonging BELLS ring out A group of EUNUCHS stand at the
gates solemn tolling rustic hand bells calling

EUNUCHS
Ago Ago

Nawi cranes her neck to see but Dayo hits her arm all
around them people LOOK DOWN averting their eyes A MOTHER
tugs at her CURIOUS CHILD

CURIOUS CHILD
I want to see

MOTHER
(whispers --)
The King does not allow us to look
upon the Agojie

The AGOJIE TROOPS march toward the towering wooden gates of
the palace The women have majesty and swagger their weapons
clang and swing from their hips Their skin shines NAWI
LIFTS HER EYES to get one glance at them fascinated by their
confidence their power
Nanisca and Amenza walk together Nanisca’s face is dark
pensive Amenza tries to cheer her

AMENZA
Nanisca it is a victory they
cheer for you

NANISCA
They do not know an evil is coming

AMENZA
They know you will protect them

Amenza gestures at the refugees Nanisca sees A MOTHER RE-
UNITED WITH HER BABY DAUGHTERS WITH THEIR FATHERS WIVES
WITH THEIR HUSBANDS holding them weeping

Some kind of determination comes into her face As she passes
through the open gates of the palace she turns to the HEAD
EUNUCH TANONU bald in feminine make-up and a purple robe

NANISCA
I wish to speak to the King

TANONU
He is only seeing wives today

NANISCA
Tell him I will wait

11 EXT FARM ROADS OUTSIDE ABOMEY - DAY 11

Nawi and Dayo wander home carrying their full baskets

NAWI
What do you think it’s like In the
palace

DAYO

All the King’s wives wear opals and
rubies and dresses of silk from
the foreign ships They drink from
golden cups as delicate as a leaf

NAWI
Not the Agojie They drink from the
skulls of the men they have killed

DAYO
No

Nawi grabs up a broken branch brandishes it like a machete
Slices the top off of a tall TERMITE MOUND Termites scatter

NAWI
(morbid fun --)
Yes They cut off their heads and
melt off the skin in boiling hot
cauldrons They make necklaces out
of their teeth

Dayo makes a face Nawi laughs They reach Nawi’s farm The
children run to greet her

CHILDREN
Nawi Come see Nawi

LIDA
We have a visitor A rich man from
Cana

Dayo looks at Nawi whispers --

DAYO
Maybe he is handsome

Nawi’s father MORU rushes to her Eager

MORU
Where have you been You are late

NAWI
Mother didn’t tell me

He takes her basket

EXT FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 12
Moru brings Nawi to an outdoor area with a table drinks
poured -- Ydande fawns over the SUITOR his back to us Nawi
sees the man watches him turn HER FACE FALLS He is in

his 50’s an old man in her world She presses down her
revulsion as he comes toward her in his cloth caftan and
cowrie-strand necklaces signifying wealth

MORU
This is Master Abade His wife has
died He seeks a new bride who is
strong enough to bear him new
children
(to Abade)
As you can see she is healthy

Abade walks around Nawi examining her physique He lifts her
arm coldly judging
ABADE
Skinny

MORU
If she is not with child by the
rains bring her back

Abade notices another flaw a bumpy white SCAR on the flesh
of her back upper arm Thumbs it

ABADE
What is this

MORU
She was an active child

ABADE
A disobedient child

There’s a certain relish in the way he says this

ABADE (CONTD)
Leave us alone for a moment

Moru escorts Ydande away into the house leaving Nawi alone
She swallows fearful Abade steps closer

ABADE (CONTD)
I own three fields of palm trees
You will work

She doesn’t answer

ABADE (CONTD)
You do not talk to your husband

He SLAPS her across the face Nawi shocked YELPS in pain

ABADE (CONTD)
In my house you will learn to obey

He GRABS HER ARM She SHOVES HIM a reflex action He SHOUTS
falling back into the table knocking things over A pitcher
of juice spills on his caftan Her eyes widen

Moru and Ydande rush out from the house shocked by the
scene Moru quickly goes to Abade who slaps Moru’s hand away
as he rises GLARING

ABADE (CONTD)
The whispers were right this girl
is worthless I will let it be
known No one will pay for this
wife

He leaves the yard Moru turns to Nawi fury in his eyes

EXT ABOMEY STREETS - SHORT TIME LATER 13

Moru DRAGS NAWI his hand gripping her arm The children run
after him crying

LIDA
No Papa She’s sorry Papa

Ydande breathless hastens after them realizing where Moru
is going

They are at THE PALACE WALLS Moru marches up to the WOODEN
GATES Nawi in his grasp Pounds on it Calls --

MORU
I wish to give my daughter to the
King

THE GATES OPEN and an Agojie IZOGIE who we saw at the
rescue looks down at Nawi

IZOGIE
What is she good for

MORU
A soldier a slave I do not care
She brings shame on our family No
husband will have her

NAWI
I will not marry an old man who
beats me

Izogie raises a brow Maybe they can use this girl

MORU
Go to war then You will understand
what pain is

Nawi steals a look at Izogie then looks down remembering
the rule that they must not look at the Agojie Izogie sees
this gesture of respect She opens the door holding it

IZOGIE
Enter

Nawi looks at Ydande and Moru hurt in her eyes She turns
and walks inside THE GATES CLOSE

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 14
Nawi lifts her eyes looks around her heart racing

IZOGIE
Come

Nawi follows She is agog at everything around her the life
of the mysterious palace she has always wondered about

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Close your mouth You look like a
fish

Nawi claps her mouth shut as they walk through THE VAST
space

In one area A LARGE GROUP OF AGOJIE WOMEN practice fighting
with machetes led by TARA The heavy weapons ring out with
each hit Another LARGE GROUP in a drill lunging spinning
shouting with spears lead by a young muscular soldier named
ESI And ANOTHER GROUP working on their hand-to-hand combat
led by a strong Agojie named CINDRA

At the opposite end of the grounds a LARGE GROUP OF MALE
SOLDIERS move through grappling drills

Further along LARGE WOODEN VATS fires lit beneath them
Older women use long wooden paddles to stir as STEAM RISES

NAWI
What’s in there

IZOGIE
Indigo dye

NAWI
Oh

The women lift out pantaloons

IZOGIE
What did you think it was

NAWI
-Heads

IZOGIE
(scoffing)
No

They walk on

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Those are the heads

She points to a low-burning fire sending black smoke upward
to three skulls impaled on tall bamboo poles

IZOGIE (CONTD)
The men who raided our village
They disrespect King Ghezo They
pay a steep price

Nawi glances at a group of MEN in robes in discussion in
front of the group of MALE MAHI CAPTIVES still bound They
drop their eyes as they pass

IZOGIE (CONTD)
The rest will be sold In Ouidah

A long wall of pillars and dried PALM FRONDS woven together
separates the private quarters from the public space
stretching across the end of the parade ground

IZOGIE (CONTD)
No men but the eunuchs are allowed
in the palace after dark Beyond
this wall this is a palace of
women

Nawi can see people moving the music of WOMEN’S VOICES
Izogie leads them into

EXT PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS 15

It is different here more inviting A small marketplace
where WOMEN are cooking food -- balls of akasa and fried yam
cakes Selling handicrafts There are women potters others
sew others string cowrie shells There are CHILDREN
giggling chasing each other with abandon

Izogie moves through another pass way Nawi follows

INT PALACE - AGOJIE BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS 16

A low open building with a large grassy courtyard at its
center The Agojies’ private quarters Some are here
relaxing braiding hair tending to wounds Nawi sees the
bond of their sisterhood

Izogie points to an area of mats lined up close together A
GROUP OF THIRTY WOMEN are there -- among them Dahomey
rescues like Fumbe and Mahi captives like Ode from the
village

IZOGIE
Trainees sleep there Find yourself
a space

Izogie calls out to the group --

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Bathe yourselves Add your clothes
to the fire You will no longer
need them

Izogie walks away Nawi looks around still anxious

INT PALACE - KING’S PRIVATE CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 17

A LINE OF WOMEN sit in an assortment of gilt European chairs
They are different ages all beautiful and adorned in
colorful jewelry coral and cowries weaved into their hair

At the end of this line of chairs we find NANISCA standing
still in her blood-smeared clothing

KING GHEZO -- 28 enters the room accompanied by Tanonu
Ghezo is handsome youthful at the beginning of his reign
He wears a long robe embroidered with crocodiles The only
ornament a small gold chain of European manufacture He
walks as if the earth were honored by its burden

All the women get on their knees and touch their heads to the
ground Nanisca too From her vantage point on the ground
she sees the KING’S FEET the only feet we have yet seen
wearing SANDALS a royal affectation He stops before her

GHEZO
Nanisca Come with me

The other women’s eyes follow them out A beautiful wife
SHANTE speaks to Tanonu

SHANTE
Why does he favor her She shows no
respect Comes here filthy

TANONU
She fought for him during the coup
Put him on the throne What did you
do Locked yourself in a cupboard

Shante watches Nanisca disappear down the hall jealous

18 INT PALACE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 18
Nanisca falls in step with the young king

GHEZO
Why do you wait with the wives

NANISCA

I need to speak to you before the
council convenes

(then --)
The Mahi tribe did not raid our
village alone They had help

(shows him the horseshoe)
From the Oyo

He takes the horseshoe

NANISCA (CONTD)
They attack our people in alliance
with the Mahi They have broken the
treaty

GHEZO
(angry)
It is not my treaty My brother
bowed to them Paid them their
blood money

NANISCA
They are testing the new King

GHEZO
So we will do as they do Raid the
Oyo villages sell their people

A subtle fury flickers on Nanisca’s face
NANISCA

And who does that help The white
traders not us

GHEZO
It shows them we are no longer
afraid

NANISCA

You know of the changes at our port
in Ouidah The English are gone
They will no longer trade in
captives

GHEZO
Empty words Americans Portuguese
Dutch they will never stop the
trade

NANISCA
And this is why the Oyo wish to
conquer us

GHEZO
(disbelief)
Conquer us

NANISCA
They test you to see if we will
fight back And if we do not they
will mount a larger attack perhaps
even here on our capital

This hits Ghezo hard

NANISCA (CONTD)
We must end the Oyo and end the
trade For all of us

Ghezo reacts This is a radical shift

NANISCA (CONTD)
I fought for you against your
brother because I knew you cared
for our people

GHEZO
And now you counsel me to take them
to war

NANISCA

Some things are worth fighting for

A moment between them

INT PALACE - THRONE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER 19

The ministers notice that Nanisca and Ghezo have entered
together She takes her seat among Dahomey’s ministers -- MEN
AND WOMEN Nanisca called the Miganon (General) with her
male counterpart the MIGAN an old male religious leader
AJAHE and his counterpart Nanisca’s lieutenant Amenza the
male head of logistics for the palace the MEU the female
head the MEUNON and so on

Sitting just behind the King is his favored wife Shante
there to attend to him

Ghezo takes his seat on an ornately carved wooden throne The
eunuchs try to serve him English tea in a cup and saucer but
he waves them off He TOSSES THE HORSESHOE It lands with a
thud

GHEZO
The Oyo have entered our lands
They have broken the peace When
they come for the tribute we will
not pay it

The council reacts The male general the Migan glances
harshly at Nanisca -- what the hell has she said to him

MIGAN
That would mean war

GHEZO
We have been under the foot of the
Oyo since before my father’s time
Because we feared their might But
who are we as a people if we allow
fear to control us

MIGAN
My king I agree But we are not
ready for such a war They are a
nation twice our size with horses
and more muskets We need time to
plan and prepare our armies

NANISCA
The Agojie are ready

MIGAN
How many did you lose in this last
battle Against the lowly Mahi

Nanisca sees Ghezo listening to him

MEUNON
Dahomey has prospered in the peace
and the Oyo as well

NANISCA
The slave trade is the reason we
prosper But at what price It is a
poison slowly killing us And the
Europeans know it They come to our
lands for their human cargo

MEUNON
They come to trade We sell them
what they want
AMENZA
But why do we sell our captives
For muskets To capture more
people to sell for more muskets
It is a circle with no end A
spiral leading into darkness This
is not the way Fa seeks light

NANISCA
We have other things to sell Gold
Palm oil They need it for lamps
their cookfires for their pulleys
and machines We can double our
harvest This is our advantage over
the Oyo and their desert lands

Shante scoffs at this

SHANTE
She wants to make us a nation of
peasants

NANISCA
I want Dahomey to survive

Shante lays her feminine bejeweled hand on Ghezo’s arm

SHANTE
The Gods have brought us a new
king A King to be feared
(to Nanisca)
No one fears a farmer

MIGAN
She is right And even if we could
defeat the Oyo there will be
losses and that leaves us
vulnerable

AMENZA
The ancestors will protect us A
defeat of the Oyo will please them

MEU
We have already started to gather
the tribute Perhaps we pay to buy
us time

Ghezo feels the pressure Long beat then --

GHEZO
I promise it will be our last
(beat)
(MORE)

GHEZO (CONTD)
As for the palm oil show me
Nanisca Show me how much you can
produce And we will see

He leaves with Shante The Migan turns to Nanisca in anger

MIGAN
You speak in secret to the King
You seek to cut me out

NANISCA
If the King respects me it is
because I have earned it

Nanisca walks away

EXT ENEMY VILLAGE - DUSK 20

Across the grasses thundering hoofs of THIRTY OYO WARRIORS
arriving at the ruins of the Mahi village Their leader OBA
ABUA riding in the lead pulls up his horse and HOLDS UP HIS
ARM

They come to a stop Oba in long red cloth robes and English
boots swings off his horse and strides into the near empty
village A protective scarf covers all but his piercing eyes
He is followed by his second-in-command BOMA

He comes to the corpse of an Agojie uses his foot to kick
her face-up He turns to his assembled warriors enraged

OBA
Do you see this Your comrades
murdered By women
He turns to Boma
OBA (CONTD)
The Dahomey grow too bold under

their new King

BOMA
No more peace

OBA
Peace is for the weak
EXT PALACE - AGOJIE COURTYARD - DUSK 21

THE AGOJIE eat a meal sitting in small groups on the ground
their weapons piled against the walls

The Recruits including Fumbe now dressed in a simple
uniform sit together The MAHI CAPTIVES WHISPER to each
other anxiously One of them ODE is athletic steely Takes
in their surroundings Her eyes fall on

Nawi sitting alone still in the clothes she arrived in
She’s entranced by the Agojie their weapons the thick metal
jewelry on their arms and wrists the easy way they laugh and
chat Izogie and Tara among them

She creeps over to the pile of spears touches one spike

ESI (0C)
Do not touch another soldiers
weapon

A young muscular woman ESI glares at her Nawi quickly
pulls her hand away Izogie walks up

IZOGIE
Especially that one It is cursed
Esi couldn’t hit an elephant ina
stampede

She laughs Esi grins back

ESI
Turn your back and see how true my
aim is

She walks away Izogie picks up her own machete holds it
out Nawi touches it it CUTS HER FINGER Izogie smiles

IZOGIE
Spent all my liberties walking the
river till I found the perfect
whetstone shaped smooth by a
waterfall Sharpens to a thorn

Izogie sees Nawi staring at her FINGERNAILS Izogie has
sharpened them to points like talons She jabs two fingers
forward

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Pop out their eyeballs fight is
over
Izogie makes an eyeball sucking sound Nawi grins
IZOGIE (CONTD)
They are also useful in keeping the

trainees in line

Nawi’s grin fades

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Why are you not in uniform

NAWI
I let the others bathe first

IZOGIE
The first rule of training Always
obey Izogie

Nawi nods Doesn’t move Izogie looks at her Taps her
fingernails on her spear

IZOGIE (CONTD)
I am Izogie

Nawi gets it quickly walks out

INT PALACE - BATHS - SHORT TIME LATER 22

Nawi moves down the stairs into the dimly lit underground
cavern where natural springs create pools of water A fire
burns hot in a clay oven She removes her dress Puts it into
the oven watches it catch fire She steps into one of the
baths feeling the heat of the water sink into her bones

WATER AND MOVEMENT Nawi is startled ANOTHER WOMAN is there
at the far end Through the steam we recognize NANISCA Nawi
starts to get out

NAWI
I’m sorry

NANISCA
You may stay

Nawi sinks back down in the water modest Nanisca cleans her
arms her head She still wears the shark tooth necklace
Nawi takes in her taut physicality her scars Enamored

NAWI
Are you a soldier

NANISCA
(curt)
What do you think

A beat Nawi begins to wash too
NANISCA (CONTD)

You are one of the captives we
freed

NAWI
No My father brought me As a gift
to the King

NANISCA
(disdainful --)
Is your father rich
(before she answers --)
He must be If he were poor he
would have sold you to a rich
husband

NAWI
He tried I don’t want a husband I
want to be a soldier An Agojie

NANISCA
And what does that mean to you

NAWI
It means you are admired You are
unafraid You are somebody

NANISCA
Some of those things are true
(beat)
How old are you

NAWI
I have nineteen years

NANISCA
That is old for a recruit

NAWI
I will work hard Harder than
anyone

NANISCA
Many obstinate daughters are dumped
at the palace They usually fail

Nawi’s rebellious nature awakens She eyes Nanisca

NAWI
All our lives they tell stories of
the Agojie That you have magic
But you look like a regular old
woman to me

NANISCA
Fighting is not magic It is skill
We will see if you have any

She gets out of the bath Amused

EXT PALACE - AGOJIE COURTYARD - NIGHT 23

Torches light the area DRUMS PLAY Nawi Fumbe Ode and the
other recruits watch as the AGOJIE sing and dance in a
victory celebration They see Izogie Amenza also TARA from
the opening battle and CINDRA The warriors dance in unison
the footwork kickass perfectly matched as they move Strong
Joyful Izogie and Amenza lead as two by two they go to the
center -- dance together laughing forehead to forehead

Nawi watches firelight illuminating her smile This joy is a
feeling so foreign to her A DRUM HIT STOPS THE MUSIC

Nawi notices the LEADER of the Agojie walking through the
ranks regal in her shark’s tooth necklace and a breastplate
made of hundreds of cowrie shells Nawi realizes it is

NANISCA the woman Nawi was rude to in the baths Nanisca
turns LOOKS AT NAWI as she passes Nawi is mortified
Nanisca steps up to a raised platform Amenza STAMPS A SPEAR

AMENZA
Gbhoje

The Agojie in unison turn toward her hands behind their
backs Amenza calls out to the Recruits

AMENZA (CONTD)
I am Amenza You come to the palace
of Ghezo the ninth monarch of the
Dahomey people descendants of the
leopard Agasu Beloved of the twin
gods Mawu and his sister Leesa

Nanisca steps forward looking out over the women their
faces in conflict fearful of what awaits them

NANISCA
You are called to join the Agojie
We claim victory or we claim
death

The women react
NANISCA (CONTD)
Our scars are our pride They tell
our story Of how we were stronger

Of how we survived

ON NAWI taking this in

NANISCA (CONTD)
We fight For Dahomey for our
sisters For our great king You
will be revered You will be paid
for your work Your opinion will be
heard No tribe or kingdom in all
of Africa shares this privilege
Women toiling in the fields
nursing children sleeping in their
husbands beds will know of your
battles and sing your praise and
wish they could be you

ON NAWI -- these words affecting her

NANISCA (CONTD)

For this honor we live out our
lives in these palace walls We
will take no husband We will bear
no children

(then --)
I offer you a choice Any woman who
does not wish to stay may leave No
harm will come to you

The Recruits glance at each other The Mahi captives look at
Ode She looks back After a moment a few start to walk out
of the courtyard Then a few more They look back at her Ode
remains

NANISCA looks at Nawi Their EYES MEET Nanisca expecting
Nawi to walk away NAWI plants her feet Stands like the
Agojie hands behind her back chest high You couldn’t pry
her away

Fumbe looks at the young women leaving thinking Then she
sees Nawi and decides to stay Nanisca looks out over the
remaining women

NANISCA (CONTD)
Show me you are worthy

INT PALACE - AGOJIE BARRACKS - LATE NIGHT 24
Nawi picks up a mat looks around for a spot She sees Ode
making a space for herself alone She sees Fumbe sitting on

her mat weeping Nawi lays her mat down next to her

NAWI
What’s your name

FUMBE
Fumbe

NAWI
Why do you cry

FUMBE
I am not a soldier

NAWI
Then why did you stay

FUMBE
I have nowhere else to go

Nawi sits down next to her

NAWI
So we are the same

Ode has been listening Nawi looks over

NAWI (CONTD)
You are Mahi Why did you stay

ODE
Here I will be the hunter not

prey

Nawi lays down The three girls stare up wondering what lies
in store

EXT ROAD OF REEDS - EARLY MORNING 25

A road carved through a sea of six foot tall reeds The
trainees in their matching uniforms RUN barefoot in the
deep red dirt Nawi sprints ahead determined to be first
but burns herself out and starts to drag Ode catches her
first Passes her Then the rest Nawi struggles to keep up
Izogie appears running alongside

IZOGIE
Too slow The Oyo will catch you
Hang you up by your feet to cut
your throat

Nawi tries to run faster She THROWS UP

EXT DRY RIVERBED —- DAY 26

The exhausted trainees are lined up pulling sacks filled
with heavy stones up a rocky incline Nawi is dripping with
sweat as she struggles to lift her sack She notices they are
monitored by the high brass Nanisca and Amenza

The trainees trudge forward strain under the weight
Barefoot hitting rocks and sharp twigs Izogie confronts a
tearful Ode whose feet are bloody and cut

IZOGIE
We are feared because we do not
fear pain The more you welcome it
the less you will feel

Ode struggles back to her feet Izogie shadows Nawi who is
losing ground

IZOGIE (CONTD)
You move like a sloth

She does a funny impression of a sloth in slow motion Nawi
grits her teeth Uses her firewood trick Shifts the bag onto
her back like a backpack She can run now gaining speed

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Yes Yes

Nawi passes Ode reaches the top She smiles But her smile
fades as she sees FUMBE far behind tears in her eyes
TRUDGING one slow painful step at a time

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - DAY 27

The trainees are given their ammo belts They are excited
fastening them around their waists Nanisca paces

NANISCA
Today you receive your first
weapon

Each is given A COIL OF ROPE Nawi frowns She holds it
up letting it fall limply

LATER They practice tying KNOTS Nanisca comes along
pulling to see if they come undone Fumbe’s holds fast
Nanisca nods in approval and Fumbe flushes pleased Nanisca
yanks Nawi’s knot and it PULLS LOOSE

NANISCA (CONTD)
(already walking away)
Again
NAWI
(under her breath --)
A rope is not a weapon

Nanisca turns

NANISCA
You wish for a different weapon

Nawi reacts -- “shit” Nanisca takes her own machete out of
her belt Hands it to Nawi Gestures to the TWIG DUMMIES set
up in a row twenty feet away

NANISCA (CONTD)
Go Attack the soldier Take his
head

Nawi is embarrassed Everyone is watching her The machete is
much heavier than she realized She has to back down

NAWI
I apologize

NANISCA
Do not apologize Do it

Nawi meets Nanisca’s eyes Then she draws herself tall
raises the machete and rushes at the dummy swinging at its
neck with a HUGE SWIPE The blade gets STUCK barely one
inch deep into the neck

She hears LAUGHTER from the assembled group Nawi tries to
free the machete She cannot NANISCA comes forward and
easily frees her machete Then she step-turns and with
little effort SLICES OFF THE HEAD It rolls on the ground
She looks at Nawi

NANISCA (CONTD)
I would work on that rope

She walks away Nawi almost growls as she ties the shit out
of the damned rope

EXT PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT 33

The trainees wait in line for their rations Ode takes hers
and moves to eat alone Nawi takes hers as Izogie approaches

IZOGIE
Hey Tse-tse

NAWI
Who is Tse-tse

IZOGIE
You Little fly always buzzing
around full-speed But you don’t
know where you’re going

(MORE )

IZOGIE (CONTD)
We need smart warriors The dumb
ones die quickly

NAWI
I am not dumb

IZOGIE
Then show me You have to train
different The drills are a game
It is play Like when you were a
child

NAWI
I was never allowed to play I was
made to work

IZOGIE
I was born in a brothel When I had
fourteen years my mother put a
sign out to sell my virginity

Izogie looks at her There’s a coolness a distance

IZOGIE (CONTD)
The first man came and I cried for
my mother But she didn’t come The
second man came and complained of
my tears My mother whipped me The
third man came and I burned him
with an ember I plucked from the
fire with my bare hand

She shows Nawi a scar on her palm

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Your father was cruel As was my
mother It is enough to make you
cry But it is better to laugh
yes You have a new family now

As Nawi thinks a Dahomey song begins under the images

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - DAY

Izogie smoothes oil from a bowl onto her skin as she faces
Nawi in a wrestling circle Ode Fumbe and the other trainees
look on Nawi tries to get a grip on Izogie but can’t her

head drops as she struggles with the taller woman

IZOGIE
Eyes up

Nawi looks at Izogie

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Never look away

Nawi’s eyes bore into Izogie’s and then IZOGIE grins
slightly slips around her and FLIPS her to the ground Nawi
grows frustrated Grabs one of the bowls of oil and POURS IT
OVER HER HEAD drenching herself Izogie laughs as Nawi faces
her oil dripping down her face and chest This time Izogie
is the one who cannot get a hold on Nawi’s glistening limbs
Soon both are laughing

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - DAY 35

With new MACHETES in hand Nawi Ode Fumbe and the rest of
the trainees stand behind Izogie The trainees follow her
movements as she slices through a machete drill Nawi is
focused but the machete is unwieldy Izogie comes to her

IZOGIE
Do not hold the sword Be the
Sword

Nawi flows with the machete using strength from her thighs
her middle to become the sword

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - LATE NIGHT 36

The grounds are empty Save for two women at the line of
training dummies Nanisca grips her machete charges down the
line in a dance of brutal efficiency as she spins slices
stabs cuts down dummy after dummy Her athleticism her
intensity is a sight to behold Izogie charges down the line
following Nanisca’s rhythm beat for vicious beat In the
shadows Nawi watches studies their relentless practice

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - DAY 37

Drills Esi leads the staff training Spinning her spear with
incredible skill and speed The trainees dive to the ground
jump back up runs forward to where the SPEARS stand pitted
into the dirt They pick them up and HURL THEM FORWARD
Most of the spears fall to the ground but Nawi’s HITS the
target

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - DAY 38
The trainees fight in pairs as Izogie watches Nawi fights

with Ode Nawi struggles to force Ode out of the circle but
Ode is strong

She gets a grip on Nawi is about to pull her out Suddenly
Nawi uses Izogie’s move to slip around her and SLAM her to
the ground Ode and Izogie are shocked

EXT SHOOTING RANGE IN THE RED DESERT - DAY 39

MALE SOLDIERS shoot at clay pot targets against the blood red
mountains of red earth A LARGE MOUND OF GUN POWDER sits atop
an open wagon

The female trainees in a line load and fire rusty old
muskets A MALE SOLDIER guides them It’s a lengthy set of
steps tear open a small fabric pouch of gun powder with
their teeth pour powder in the mizzen Stuff a musket ball
down the shaft with a wand Raise it to their shoulders
FIRE

ON NAWI THE KICK IS STRONG It pushes her back into the
arms of the male soldier guiding her She laughs a little
surprised There’s a an undeniable moment of flirtation as he
helps her regain her footing Picks up the musket and puts it
in her hands He touches her hips and shows her how to find
strength in her body as she fires the powerful weapon
NANISCA watching the drill sees this

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - DAY 40

Two LARGE CROWDS of Agojie warriors and male soldiers face
off The energy is aggressive boastful vocal They yell out
competing chants

MALE SOLDIERS
Men of Dahomey feel no pain We
take a bullet and shoot again

AGOJIE WOMEN
Men of Dahomey run away Agojie
women stand and fight We pluck out
hearts Show Ghezo’s might

In the middle of the warring factions Izogie stands opposite
a LARGE MALE SOLDIER A short double edged spear separates
them THE BLADES BURIED INTO EACH OTHER’S SHOULDERS They
stare at each other daring the other to break Izogie stares
blankly the only sign of the excruciating pain is the
wetness in her eyes The Male Soldier grimaces but holds his
ground

NANISCA and the MIGAN stand together watching their troops
each rooting for their fighter to win

Nawi Fumbe Ode and the trainees look on in awe and
excitement And then Izogie TAKES A STEP FORWARD burying
the blades even deeper The Male Soldier stares backthen
steps back in defeat Izogie snatches the blade from her
bleeding shoulder pounds her chest with a PRIMAL YELL

The Agojie go nuts Even Nanisca applauds Nawi Fumbe Ode
and the trainees jump up and down joining in the exuberant
CHANT

EXT ROAD TO DAHOMEY - SUNSET 41

The trainees walk together talking and laughing starting to
be a unit Silhouetted against the sun Nawi drapes an arm
over Fumbe’s shoulder

NAWI
Show me how to tie the rope

FUMBE
Never It is the only thing I can
do better than you

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - LATE NIGHT 42

All is quiet Everyone is asleep Nawi leads Fumbe and other
trainees SNEAKING OUT Ode sees them Nawi meets her eyes
She nods her head “Come on” Ode hesitates then follows
They dash across the grounds

AT THE STAND OF DUMMIES they pause Nawi hands out little
gunpowder sachets Each trainee sets about coating the necks
of the dummies with the gunpowder They laugh quietly

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - MORNING 43

Izogie and Tara are going to demonstrate the proper head-
chopping technique to the trainees WATCHING AT THE SIDE
Nawi Fumbe and Ode share an excited glance

Izogie and Tara run at the dummies As their swords hit the
necks sparking the gunpowder THE HEADS EXPLODE off the
bodies Izogie and Tara stumble back The trainees stifle
their laughter Nanisca peers at Nawi

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - SHORT TIME LATER 44

Nawi Fumbe Ode and four other trainees stand before
Nanisca Izogie and Tara watch
NANISCA
Which of you designed this trick

None of the girls speak up

NANISCA (CONTD)
Then you will all be punished

NAWI
I did it

Her friends start to object

FUMBE
We all did it --

NAWI
No It was me
(beat)
I apologize

NANISCA
Once again

Nanisca gestures to Fumbe Ode and the others

NANISCA (CONTD)
Go back to the barracks

They leave as fast as they can Izogie and Tara
is alone now in front of the General

NANISCA (CONTD)
How did you make this explosion

NAWI
You don’t need a gun to use
gunpowder You just need a spark

NANISCA
But you like the guns You enjoy
practicing with the young men in
the infantry I see you flirting

NAWI
This is not allowed

NANISCA
You know it is not

NAWI
The men who are soldiers have
wives children But the Agojie
cannot It doesn’t seem fair

follow

Nawi

Nanisca is consistently surprised by Nawi

NANISCA
Were you this arrogant with your
family No wonder they gave you
away

This cuts Nawi She lashes back

NAWI
I think it is you who are arrogant

NANISCA
I am a General I have earned it
(done with her)
I should put you out --

NAWI
No please

NANISCA
I have watched soldiers die because
they were not disciplined Their
easy life did not prepare them --

NAWI
I did not have an easy life
(tears form in her eyes)
I want to be here With my sisters
I want to fight for my King

Nanisca doesn’t do well with emotion

NANISCA
Your tears mean nothing To be a
warrior you must kill your tears

Nawi’s eyes burn with prideshe bites back her emotion
Nanisca gestures for her to leave When Nawi is gone Nanisca
breathes deeply sighing It is hard to have “killed her
tears” for an entire life

EXT PALACE - AGOJIE COURTYARD - NIGHT 45

The Agojie eat Ode goes to sit near a group of Agojie
including the fierce Tara who blocks her from sitting

TARA
You are a Mahi prisoner and that
is all you will ever be

Wounded Ode turns to go but Amenza who has overheard the
exchange steps in

AMENZA
What did you say

TARA
She should be my slave not a
warrior

CINDRA
Dahomey women are the true Agojie

AMENZA
I also came here a captive Do you
think yourself better than me

TARA
(beat then --)
No Ajahi
AMENZA

If you make it through the final
test you are one of us No matter
where you come from

Tara walks away Ode stares down This has been hard for her

AMENZA (CONTD)
I was once enslaved I served the
Miganon And now I sit at the
King’s council You are what you
believe you are

Ode nods She marches into the barracks

INT PALACE - AGOJIE BARRACKS - SAME TIME 46

NAWI sits on her mat alone when Ode comes and takes her
bedding up moving it to another place

NAWI
Where are you going

ODE
You are trouble and I already have
enough of that

As Ode goes off Nawi notices Izogie pulling on her weapons
belt Attaches a knife She sees Nawi

IZOGIE
Eat up Tse-tse Nanisca favors the
strong

Nawi doesn’t move

IZOGIE (CONTD)
What is the first rule of training

NAWI
(beat then --)
Always obey Izogie

She stands Reluctantly Izogie looks at her then --

IZOGIE
Come with me

EXT PALACE WALLS - SHORT TIME LATER 47

Izogie and Nawi exit a secretive door in the Agojie compound
taking them to the street They walk toward the city lights
of Abomey ahead Izogie pulls a flask from her belt Takes a
drink Holds it out to Nawi

IZOGIE
Drink

NAWI
What is it

IZOGIE
The only thing the white men bring
worth having They call it
“whiskey”

Nawi tries it Chokes It tastes awful to her Izogie laughs

IZOGIE (CONTD)
There We finally found a way to
quiet you Your tongue will get you
kicked back to your village Why do
you challenge the Miganon

NAWI
(beat then --)
If I’m quiet she won’t see me

IZOGIE
Do you think she has time to think
about you She’s thinking about
the world She may one day be the
Kpojito

NAWI
The Woman King But we have not had
one for so many years

People in the street drop their eyes or turn away at the
sight of Izogie

IZOGIE
His brother did not honor it but
King Ghezo believes in tradition
In the twin Gods Mawu and Leesa
Man and woman Male soldiers and
female Ghezo will name a Woman
King For the Gods And the people

NAWI
Is that what Nanisca wants

IZOGIE
I cannot say But in the palace
she is a legend She was captured
as a young soldier Given up for
dead But she returned with the
Oyo bastards kofes hanging from her
belt

Nawi takes this in

INT PALACE - NANISCA’S CHAMBERS - LATE NIGHT 50

Nanisca lies on her mat in fitful sleep She wakes up
shouting covered in sweat In a moment AMENZA steps into
her chamber Nanisca pants still breathless from the dream

Amenza takes a European-style silver flask from her pocket
pours spirits into a cup -- mixes in herbs from a leather
pouch around her waist

NANISCA
Uch Menza you know I hate that
drink

AMENZA
The King drinks anything I give
him

NANISCA

The King is young He brings that
silly wife to the council

AMENZA
Shante She is ambitious She wants
to be the first among the King’s
women Maybe even the Kpojito

NANISCA
The Kpojito must have a vision

Amenza sits on the bed with her

AMENZA
Tell me the dream It dispels its
magic if you say the words

Nanisca locks eyes with her for a long moment

NANISCA
I am in the jungle And something
is out there in the darkness a
beast angry I try to hide but
it finds me

AMENZA
Perhaps the dream is a warning Let
us throw a chain

Amenza picks up a cloth bag that rattles with palm nots
clacking together

NANISCA
Not the nuts
AMENZA
Do not call them “nuts” they are

sacred

Amenza places a circular tray on the floor The tray has
carved symbols all around it and is covered with white sand
in the middle She shakes ONE PALM NUT out of the bag and
onto the sand -- draws a circle around it

Nanisca picks up the cup of sleeping medicine and drinks it
NANISCA

With any luck I’1l be asleep on the
third toss

MINUTES LATER

THE TRAY now has sixteen palm nuts thrown with circles
around them to connect a CHAIN Amenza points to a section

AMENZA
You have enemies gathering

NANISCA
I could have told you that

AMENZA
I see fire Fire and smoke
something or someone from your
past

Nanisca’s hand suddenly shoots out and messes the board --
the chain of circles disappears and the palm nuts roll

AMENZA (CONTD)
So impatient

NANISCA
It’s nonsense And your medicine
too I’m not even tired

AMENZA
Go to the altar Leave gifts for
the dead If you do not respect the
chain respect your own dream

EXT PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - SHORT TIME LATER 51

Nanisca walks the empty courtyard carrying a cloth bag
SHE HEARS SOMETHING the panting breath of someone moving
the whipping sound of a machete slicing sharply THROUGH AIR
She looks through the open palm curtain seeing

NAWI While the other women sleep she practices her moves
like she watched Nanisca and Izogie do Two hands one hand
jabs forward She has no idea she is being watched

ON NANISCA watching

AND WORKERS buzz around the tribute The MEU and MEUNON count
the items There’s a basket of brass-plated figures Baskets
of polished coral Farmers bring SACKS OF GRAIN and urns of
palm oil Muskets are stacked in a pile

KING GHEZO Shante and other wives are on the raised
platform shielded from the sun by large colorful UMBRELLAS
Amenza and the other Council Members are there Nearby a
group of male VIP’s among them the owner of the brothel
AGIDIGBI He glares at the WOMEN who left his charge and now
stand with the trainees

Nanisca motions for Izogie to step out of formation Izogie
moves to her

IZOGIE
Yes Miganon

Nanisca speaks quietly

NANISCA
You went into the city last night

IZOGIE
Yes Miganon To recruit

NANISCA
Agidigbi is a friend of the court
You know he is protected

IZOGIE
And who protects the women

Nanisca stares at her then --

NANISCA
You are my best soldier But when
you anger the King even I cannot
protect you

Beat then chastised Izogie simply nods She stands tall
moves back in formation

THE SOUND OF MUSKETS FIRING

THE MEN AND WOMEN SOLDIERS hit their chests and SHOUT OUT
COMPETITIVE CHANTS AS A SALUTE TO GHEZO He smiles at the
adoration Then his attention is drawn to

THE OYO CONTINGENT arriving in the palace There are twenty
men on horseback and in the lead two we recognize

OBA and his lieutenant BOMA Galloping in they make a
formidable entrance reining in their horses and dismounting
Oba walks forward most of his face covered by the scarf
Boma slightly behind him Ghezo with Nanisca and the Migan
just behind him meets them in the center of the Parade
Ground in a traditional ritual the gathered army and palace
royalty watching

OBA
I am General Oba Ade My
lieutenant Boma I bring King
Ghezo the esteemed regard of the
Alafin of Oyo

Oba says the words but his lack of respect is evident He
unwraps his scarf revealing his face

fierce marked by tattooed lines on his cheeks in a wave-like
pattern his earlobe elongated by a RAVEN’S BEAK pierced into
it

CLOSE ON NANISCA her eyes CHANGE as she looks at his face
She knows this man ON NANISCA frozen We SMASH CUT TO

FLASHBACK - INT DARKENED TENT - NIGHT 53

Nanisca’s POV Oba’s face over hers grunting He RAPES HER
the Raven’s beak in his ear open and taunting her Her legs
are shackled

SMASH BACK TO

NANISCA Still as a post stunned and shook as the King
finishes his words

KING GHEZO
gifts for the Alafin as is
tradition My general Nanisca will
accompany us

But Nanisca is frozen eyes glued to Oba unable to speak
His eyes fall on her and his lips curl in a belittling
smile They walk toward the collection of goods Nanisca does
not move

KING GHEZO (CONTD)
(under )
Nanisca

Nanisca straightens and follows on her guard Amenza
watches concerned having clocked the moment

Each Oyo officer examines a gift Oba picks up a musket and
examines it Boma notes to his superior

BOMA
Old and broken

MEU
This is what the traders bring us

OBA
This is less than ever before Did
you think we would not see

GHEZO
Did you think we would not see your
hand in the raid on our village

Oba smiles coolly

OBA
To make up for your shortcomings I
will accept an addition to your
tribute

He points atTHE AGOJIE WARRIORS
OBA (CONTD)

Forty Agojie Not too old We will
march them to Ouidah

ON NANISCA she finds her voice
NANISCA
For what purpose
OBA
We will use them as guards

Nanisca holds in the desire to bury her dagger in his gut
Ghezo remains calm political

GHEZO
And if I refuse

OBA
You may no longer use the port in
Ouidah for your trade

GHEZO
The port belongs to Dahomey

OBA
We have taken control It is our
port now

Ghezo is trapped Feels the eyes of his people on him Then --

GHEZO
I’m surprised you bring your horses
here to the plateau If they are
bitten by the flies they will die
of sleeping sickness Sometimes a
mouse can bring down the elephant

OBA
Do you threaten the Oyo Little
King

(MORE )

OBA (CONTD)
Your brother was weak enough for
you to kill but we are an Empire

MIGAN
(anger flaring)
You will respect the King

He goes to draw his machete but Oba’s TWO GUARDS ever at
his side step forward Ghezo holds up a hand

GHEZO
Migan This “general” attempts to
bate us But we will not jump at
his foolishness

Ghezo draws Nanisca and the Migan away They confer in
private SHANTE on the dais watches unable to hear

ANGLE ON NAWI FUMBE the other Agojie wait Ghezo and his
generals return to Oba

GHEZO (CONTD)

Twenty Agojie Of our choosing We
will march them to Ouidah and
surrender them And the port
remains open to us for our trade

Amenza is completely taken aback Nanisca has agreed

OBA
We have a deal I will leave Boma
to enjoy the feast you have
prepared

One of Oba’s soldiers brings him his horse which he mounts

OBA (CONTD)
In Ouidah I will be waiting

He turns and rides away Ten soldiers on horseback follow
while others load the tribute onto their horses

Nanisca walks to her assembled Agojie begins to hand-pick
the women she will send to Ouidah With a wave of her hand
each one is separated off from the larger group

ON NAWI her eyes widen as Nanisca looks at Izogie for a
moment then waves her hand Izogie glances toward Agidigbi in
the VIP section then marches to the discard group showing
no emotion

Nanisca moves to the trainees She sees Fumbe but passes her
by Nanisca eyes Ode Ode is resigned to be chosen

But then Nanisca’s eyes move on to Nawi Nawi holds her
breath Nanisca waves her hand Nawi must go Her face
falls

Nanisca returns to Ghezo He turns to Boma and the three
other officers

GHEZO
Now we feast

SERVANTS bring out platters piled high with food and drink
Boma and the Oyo officers move to the dais Nanisca follows
her face full of anger

EXT RITUAL GARDEN - NIGHT 55

In a secluded fenced area a large tree creates a canopy
over an altar Brass and wooden figures faces of the gods
called Vodun decorate the space This word Vodun will
someday transform into the English word -- Voodoo Nanisca
walks in The garden is empty candles are lit She kneels
bows to the statues

NANISCA
Ghosts of the dead Help us
Help me

Her eyes close and when they open again we see EMOTION
TEARS BRIMMING She pushes it back Rises defiantly Then a
voice startles her

AMENZA (VO)

other both emotional at this parting they embrace

EST SHOT - BAY OF OUIDAH - DAY 57

The waters of the huge bay are choppy and inhospitable
European tall ships anchor outside the bay Long ROWBOATS
overcome the waves to take cargo to and from the ships
piloted by KRUMEN -- Dahomey men who work the port

EXT BAY OF OUDIAH - SAME TIME 58

A ROWBOAT is rowed by FOUR KRUMEN Their passengers from the
tall ship are TWO YOUNG MEN in their mid-twenties dressed in
European fashion white pants tucked into tall boots high-
collared shirts and jackets One is a ship’s captain SANTO
FERREIRA a Brazilian of European decent empowered by his
stature The other is a light-skinned Black man MALIK
DIALLO They speak in PORTUGUESE --

FERREIRA
(subtitled --)
Hang on You don’t want to fall in

Ferreira Malik and the Krumen splash into the surf as their
boat is pulled onto the sand Other boats are also pulled
ashore their cargo unloaded by long assembly lines of men
throwing boxes

Malik steps firmly with his boots onto dry ground He takes a
long look around Speaks in Portuguese --

MALIK
(subtitled --)
I can’t believe it I’m really
here

Ferreira claps his old friend on the back

FERREIRA
It is a savage place I’m afraid
you will not find it to your liking
after the comforts of your
upbringing

MALIK
I can say the same for your ship

Ferreira feels his friend’s judgment

FERREIRA
Slave ships are the only kind that
come to these shores This is my
first crossing as Captain but I
intend to run the ship as my father
ran it You of all people
understand those ties are not
easily slipped

Ferreira and Malik grew up together but now they are men
with a wedge between them

FERREIRA (CONTD)
Come I’ll show you the city

Malik follows him

EXT STREETS OF OUIDAH - SHORT TIME LATER 59

Ouidah town is dominated by a LARGE FORT At high tide the
sea washes right up to the walls The port is crowded dirty
smelling of fish and sewage Goods are carried in large
baskets on the heads of Africans baskets full of squirming
fish sacks of grain tobacco --

WHITE MEN -- sailors and slave traders hairy dirty greet
each other in the open-air entrances to bars and brothels
There is a palpable air of immorality MANY LANGUAGES are
spoken English Portuguese French Dutch

We find Malik and Ferreira walking here They enter

EXT TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 60

A gathering area full of people rimmed by balconies of the
rooming houses the white fort LOOMING behind it its arched
entrance on the square A spiked portcullis gate hovers like
daggers above the fort entrance

ON MALIK taking it all in his eyes drawn to

The SLAVE MARKET and the BARRACOONS open pen-like prisons
full of AFRICAN MEN AND WOMEN There’s misery in every eye he
meets WHITE TRADERS examine the captives and barter

Ferreira sees Malik’s face his shock and dismay
FERREIRA
You have seen the same markets in
Brazil
Malik now notices on the other side of the Barracoons A

LINE OF WOMEN THE TWENTY HAND-PICKED AGOJIE WARRIORS
straight and proud marching into the square led by Nanisca
and Amenza Two of the Agojie carry a LARGE BASKET Malik
watches them mesmerized and then he sees

NAWI whose eyes are glued to the miserable barracoons She
has his same look of shock and horror on her face and then
SHE SEES MALIK He looks ridiculous an African man all
buttoned-up in the heat As for Malik he is utterly
fascinated by the Agojie their pride their swagger

MALIK
Are they

FERREIRA
The Dahomey Amazons Virgin
soldiers Bloodiest bitches in
Africa

Nawi turns away as her comrades pass A SMALL GROUP OF OYO
WARRIORS on horses watching the AGOJIE with leers

The Agojie line up across the square in one long row twenty
women stretching almost to the fort’s gate The scores of
people in the square can’t help but watch the events unfold

Nanisca and Amenza step forward The Agojies place the basket
in front of them step back into the line

An OLDER MAN an Oyo Bureaucrat in robes approaches

NANISCA
We bring tribute from King Ghezo

ON NAWI near to the fort’s gate one of the last in the
line She has fear in her eyes as she scans the courtyard In
various alcoves she sees traders and bureaucrats money
changing hands parchments being signed with quill pens Sees
all the men’s eyes crawling over her and her comrades

The Oyo Bureaucrat gestures and Nanisca follows his arm to
see A GROUP OF SIX OYO SOLDIERS walking toward them Leading
them is OBA

There’s a feeling of a standoff the basket stands alone in
the space between Nanisca and Oba who sneers at the Agojie

OBA
Dahomey has no soldiers man enough
They have to arm their women
Little girls playing soldier I’m
sure my men will find plenty of use
for them

He laughs It pierces Nanisca

ON NAWI she hears a rumble of movement Closest to the
fort’s entrance she sees some distance away but coming --
TWO COLUMNS OF OYO SOLDIERS

OBA (CONTD)
(ordering soldiers)
Disarm the women

ON NAWI looking at Izogie trying to gain her attention
Izogie turns and sees the danger too

ON NANISCA -- eyes boring into Oba’s

NANISCA
These soldiers are not your
tribute This is your tribute

She lifts her foot KICKING OVER THE BASKET FOUR HUMAN HEADS
roll out Their death grimaces still visible frozen in rigor
mortis The four Oyo officers left in Abomey they never rode
out alive

ON OBA he knows one of these heads his comrade BOMA
He looks in red anger at NANISCA Knows he has been set up

NANISCA (CONTD)
You disrespect our King in his own
house now we will kill you in
yours

In the square there is shouting the Bureaucrat calling for
soldiers

NANISCA (CONTD)
(yells to her soldiers --)
Eh-dabo

The Agojie take off sprinting for an alcove led by Izogie
Nawi follows NAWI glances back is shocked to see Nanisca
DRAW HER WEAPON Oba draws as well Their eyes are alight
with fury squaring off to fight Nawi looks back at the
Agojie who disappear up a stairwell

Then she turns races back to the FORT ENTRANCE The Oyo
soldiers have almost reached the gate as

Nawi draws her machete and CUTS THE ROPE that suspends the
spiked portcullis gate THE IRON GATE FALLS spikes

plummeting trapping them inside The soldiers swarm the
gate get their hands on the bars -- strain to LIFT IT
ON NANISCA AND OBA their blades clashing Nanisca intends

to kill this man But her rage rather than her skill is
driving her movements making her sloppy

NAWI (0C)
Miganon

Nanisca turns to see NAWI who points at the fort entrance
where the soldiers have lifted the gate and are POURING
THROUGH Distracted Oba pounces KNOCKING HER MACHETE OUT
OF HER HAND

Oba SMILES Nanisca will surely be captured ON NANISCA
furious but resigned motions to Nawi

NANISCA
Go

The two Agojie plunge into the crowd fighting their way to
the alcove OBA and his soldiers PURSUE

MALIK sees this looks at Nawi and Nanisca wishing them
escape

Nanisca and Nawi sprint into the shadowy alcove

CAMERA STAYS WITH THEM as they follow the stairs to the high
wall that edges the cliffsThey can HEAR the thunder of
footsteps behind them They scramble up the wall and LEAP

EXT OCEAN - CONTINUOUS 61

Nanisca and Nawi drop from the DIZZYING HEIGHT crash into
the ocean below pop to the surface FOUR CANOES are held
steady in the water by FOUR MALE DAHOMEY WARRIORS with long
poles The boats are filled with the other Agojie Izogie and
Amenza stand on a nearby canoe Amenza pulls Nanisca in

Nawi struggles against the waves IZOGIE flings out a rope

IZOGIE
Grab on

Nawi lunges to catch the rope Grips it gritting her teeth
as Izogie pulls NANISCA stands in a canoe

Above Oba and his soldiers can only watch They raise their
muskets FIRE Bullets splash the water around them

NANISCA
Push off

Nawi breathless holds on

EXT SECLUDED SHORELINE - LATE DAY 62

The canoes are pulled onto shore by the male soldiers The
exhausted but exhilarated Agojie slosh through the surf
fall onto the sand

NAWI is bent over breathless and then NANISCA steps
before her

NANISCA
Why did you not follow the plan
You were to go to the boats

NAWI
The soldiers were coming If I did
not move when I did --

NANISCA
So you are the hero You can act on
your own without orders

NAWI
You would never have escaped

Izogie shoots her a look

IZOGIE
Nawi

A beat between them Nanisca fights off a stab of feeling

NANISCA
We are Agojie We do not act alone
We move together With one purpose
Alone you are vulnerable Alone
you are killed or worse It is you
who faced capture by disobeying my
orders

Nawi looks down Amenza hears this knows Nanisca is
speaking of her own past Nanisca speaks to all the soldiers

NANISCA (CONTD)
Now you have seen the barracoons A
captured Agojie is a slave

(MORE)

NANISCA (CONTD)
Used by men Sold to a ship where
human beings are piled up like
fish To rot It is better to die
To cut your own throat

Nanisca walks away Nawi swallows overwhelmed Amenza
follows after Nanisca Speaks softly

AMENZA
I will never question you in front
of others But it is you who did
not follow the plan

Nanisca silences her with a wave of her hand and strides
away Swallows back the emotion the memories

CUT TO

PRESENT - EXT PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT 65

The Agojie have returned and are home on the other side of
the palm curtain greeting their comrades Fumbe embraces
Nawi helps her with her weapons thrilled her friend is home
again Nawi smiles but her eyes follow Nanisca as she
enters alone

INT PALACE - KING’S CHAMBERS - SHORT TIME LATER 66

CAMERA tracks Nanisca as she walks down the hall She passes
an open archway where she looks in to see

THE KING’S WIVES AND CHILDREN Shante is with the other young
wives lounging One of them INIYA NURSES A BABY a young
prince on her breast Nanisca is drawn to the mother and
child Shante catches her eye and gestures her inside

SHANTE
I hear you have had a victory

NANISCA
A small victory in a large war

SHANTE
Nanisca I think we have started
on a wrong foot I wish to be your
friend I can help you I have the
King’s ear We should work
together to serve our king to
ensure he grows only more
powerful

NANISCA
It is you who wants to be powerful
To stay safe and rich in your fine
palace

SHANTE
Too much change can be dangerous I
have said this much to my husband

NANISCA
Then we will soon understand who
truly has his ear

Nanisca leaves the chamber Shante watches after her

EXT OUIDAH - TOWN SQUARE - MORNING 67

Oba and his advisors stand outside the barracoons talking
with a few ship captains among them Ferreira Malik stands
nearby listening in Oba speaks to the Captains a man
translates his words into Portuguese murmuring behind him

OBA
Dahomey is an abomination with an
army of whores We will march to
their city And we will take it

FERREIRA
(in Portugese subtitled)
Tell him I know Ghezo He will
fight to the end for his people

The interpreter starts to tell Oba but Oba waves him off

OBA
I know what he said Ghezo is a
usurper He stole the crown The
Mahi the Egbo they will join us
Dahomey is the only tribe in Africa
with women soldiers and women in
the council room It is against the
gods We will put the women of
Dahomey in their place

ON MALIK overhearing this Oba smiles at the slave ship
captains

OBA (CONTD)
More cargo for your ships The
Agojie sell high at the markets
(to his interpreter)
Tell them Ouidah is open for
business

Oba leaves heading for the entrance to the fort with his
retinue Ferreira turns to Malik In Portuguese --

FERREIRA
You wish to see Abomey Then we
must go now With gifts for the
King Before it is no more

EXT JUNGLE TRAIL - LATE DAY 68

Miles of lush jungle We spot the travelers slowly picking
their way through it

A LINE OF PORTERS carry a strange assortment of GIFTS on
their heads a gilt end table a long bolt of deep pink silk
A crate of whiskey and rum A large ornate clock

Malik and Ferreira bring up the rear slogging in the heat

EXT PALM FOREST - LATE DAY 69

ROWS AND ROWS OF PALMS the fields full of WORKERS men high
in the trees picking the nuts Women on the ground carrying
baskets full of nuts on their heads toward

AN AREA WITH LARGE CALDRONS fires lit beneath them The
nuts are loaded from the wheelbarrows into the vats The oil
is separated off the top of the cauldrons by large metal
ladles WOMEN do the hot work of ladling the oil into CLAY
POTS

Nanisca shows Ghezo the operation

NANISCA
The oil must cool in the ground for
several days and then it will be
ready for transport

WOMEN carry the pots to a cleared area dotted with HOLES dug
in the ground round pools rimmed with dirt The women POUR
THE OIL in the holes Steam rises up Then they lay large
palm fronds over the holes Further away MEN dig more pools
as the operation WIDENS

NANISCA (CONTD)
This field alone produces hundreds
of barrels If we harvest many
fields each year we will have a
continuous supply to trade

Ghezo is impressed

GHEZO
I did not see a path before
Nanisca But now I do

NANISCA
Vision is seeing what others do
not

Ghezo takes this in Then --

GHEZO
I see our greatness We will
conquer the Oyo and then expand
our territory We will be the
greatest empire in Africa

NANISCA
Yes my king But let us not be an
empire who sells its people Let us
be an empire who loves its people

GHEZO
My brother sold our own I would
never do that

NANISCA

Even if they are not Dahomey they
are still our people

(then --)
The white man has brought
immorality here They will not stop
until the whole of Africa is theirs
to enslave

EXT PALACE - AGOJIE COURTYARD - NIGHT 70

The Agojie eat in small groups around fires Nawi’s
attention is drawn to two of the soldiers who sit together
In the shadows of the firelight there’s a subtle intimacy

Nawi takes this in as Fumbe Ode and the other recruits
start to go into the barracks They are stopped by an order

IZOGIE
Trainees A final test is being
prepared You will be pitted
against each other to perform your
battle skills before the King
Those who pass the test will become
Agojie And those fail will leave
the palace never to return

Nawi and Fumbe exchange glances This is it They will be
in or out

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Look to your weapons Tomorrow is
the day

INT PALACE - AGOJIE BARRACKS - LATE NIGHT 71

Nawi sits on her bed roll her dagger and machete laid out
and shining But it is the rope knot she carefully practices

NAWI
(under )
Over Under Around Down

She looks over at ODE who sharpens her machete with a
leather strap Ode tests the blade Does a few moves
handling her machete with ease Her eyes meet Nawi’s Game
face on Nawi feels her own weapon it is dull

EXT ABOMEY PALACE - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN 72

Nawi sneaks through the secret door Izogie showed her

EXT JUNGLE - EARLY MORNING 73

Nawi jogs in the jungle she HEARS something in the brush
a majestic cheetah strolls past Nawi watches then resumes
her jog

EXT JUNGLE - WATERFALL - SHORT TIME LATER 74

Nawi finds a waterfall She bends to pick out black stones
from the water’s edge Finds one smooth as silk She uses the
whetstone to sharpen her machete scraping it along the
blade then she hears

VOICES Male voices Speaking in Portuguese She takes the
stone and her machete and DISAPPEARS into the foliage

MALIK appears just awakening from their night camp his
breaches and shirt open barefoot He goes to the water’s
edge Splashes his face fills his canteen

Malik looks out at the shimmering water Then he TAKES OFF
ALL HIS CLOTHES shirt breeches he is soon naked He
immerses himself swimming out into the center He lays back
takes in the beauty surrounding him

LATER

Malik’s wet feet step over stones to reach the place where he
left his clothes and -- THEY’RE GONE He starts muttering in
Portuguese Peering into the trees sensing a rat

MALIK
(in Portuguese --)
Santo This isn’t funny

And then HE SEES NAWI stepping out near the tree line
dagger in hand He quickly covers himself with his hands

MALIK (CONTD)
(subtitled)
Do you speak Portuguese

Nawi glares at him
NAWI
Go back to Ouidah Slaver Naked
like the people you sell

Malik surprises her by answering her in Fonbe

MALIK
I am not a slaver

NAWI
You understand me

MALIK
My mother was Dahomey

NAWI
Where is she now

MALIK
(beat then --)
She is gone

Nawi is taking all this in her curiosity peaked

NAWI
You do not look like Dahomey

MALIK
My father is white

NAWI
So you are Dahomey but not
And white man but not

MALIK
Yes

They stare at each other Then --

MALIK (CONTD)
Do you think I could have my pants
now

Nawi still wary tucks her blade back into her belt tosses
the clothes to Malik He pulls them on

NAWI
(still wary)
I saw you in Ouidah Why are you
here In the jungle

MALIK
My name is Malik I am going to
Abomey The place my mother told me
so much about
(beat)
Perhaps I will see you too

NAWI
If you are allowed into the palace

She sees a crucifix on his bare chest Reaches for it then
pulls her hand back He takes it off and hands it to her She
examines it

NAWI (CONTD)
One of the King’s wives worships
this Vodun I believe in Legba

MALIK
Who is Legba

NAWI
He is the trickster My life has
been full of tricks so I believe
in him

THEY HEAR VOICES -- men approaching She drops the crucifix

MALIK
Wait

She disappears as Ferreira appears
FERREIRA

(in Portuguese)
There you are

They go to fill their canteens Malik collects his chain

EXT STREETS OF ABOMEY - DAY 75

Malik Ferreira and their party make their way up the crowded
streets Malik takes it all in He has never seen a thriving
city of African people artisans farmers music trade The
people happy and prosperous FREE It thrills him

Malik Ferreira and the women bearing the gifts lead the way
toward THE PALACE the huge double gates opened by a coterie
of brightly clad Eunuchs

Malik is welcomed by the Dahomey people -- smiling accepting
him It feels like a homecoming as he passes through to

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 76

A riot of color Umbrellas waving and flags flying Ghezo
sits on a large dais surrounded by AGOJIE GUARDS The
porters bearing gifts are swarmed by his wives also on the
dais they argue over the pink silk

Malik hangs back with Ferreira In Portuguese --

MALIK
(subtitled --)
You say it is savage But it is
magnificent

FERREIRA
You see it through rose-colored
glasses Why do you think the
King’s Guards are all women
Because he trusts no man

Malik looks at Ghezo who turns his attention to NAWI and the
other trainees armed and ready oiled for battle their skin
shining

Ghezo addresses the trainees This is the closest they have
ever been to their charismatic and handsome King

GHEZO
There will be one last test A war
game We will see which of you are
fit to be called Agojie

He gestures to an obstacle course set up a wall of HUGE
BRAMBLES the size of cars A FENCE OF THORNS and behind it
a mud pit -- rising out of that A WALL of soil and stone
fifteen feet high

ON NAWI her heart stopping She has to do that

Malik watches Izogie and Tara lead the trainees off and now
it is Ferreira’s turn to present to the King Ghezo embraces
his old friend They speak in Portuguese --

GHEZO (CONTD)
Too long Santo You hide yourself

FERREIRA
Your Portuguese is flawless Your
Majesty You have been practicing

Nanisca and the Migan Amenza and her male counterpart the
AJAHE -- all watch this reunion of Ferreira and Ghezo The
Migan leans in to Nanisca

MIGAN
I do not like this Captain Puffed
up like a banty rooster

NANISCA
Finally we agree

The generals share a look as Ferreira makes a showy bow and
offers HIS SPYGLASS as a gift to the King Malik bows as well
-- offers an ORNATE ENGLISH SWORD

FERREIRA
This is Malik His mother was taken
from Dahomey as a captive and
enslaved in my country

Ghezo is stricken by this He speaks to Malik in Fonbe

GHEZO
My mother was also taken Sold away
by my own brother I have men in
your country searching for her
They will bring her back Perhaps
they can bring your mother too

MALIK
My mother is dead
(this affects Ghezo)
It was her dying wish that I come
here to her home The only place
that she was ever free

GHEZO
(sobered)
Then it is also your home We
welcome you

MALIK
Your majesty we have seen the Oyo
overrun the port at Ouidah

GHEZO
We know what kind of men the Oyo
are But they cannot defeat my
Agojie We show you today

He gestures for the men to sit down on pillows that have been
laid out A chorus of DRUMBEATS begins

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - SHORT TIME LATER 77

A HUSH falls over the crowd as drums play an ominous beat
THE AGOJIE TRAINEES including Nawi Fumbe and Ode march to
the start of the obstacle course machetes on their belts

ON THE DAIS Malik spots Nawi He leans forward

ON THE PARADE GROUND Fumbe swallows nervously Nawi glances
at her foe Ode who refuses to look at her Izogie stands
before her trainees Slowly removes her own magnificent
machete

IZOGIE
Relentlessly we will fight

Nawi meets her eyes Izogie winks Nawi raises her chin
stares at the obstacle course as she takes her place at the
starting line Her eyes are drawn to the dais where she sees
MALIK with Nanisca and the King watching her Malik raises
a hand to herIZOGIE SEES THIS Looks out at Nawi

AT THE STARTING LINE Nawi is hit with a rush of adrenaline
and nerves Izogie raises her machete and BRINGS IT DOWN

Drums BANG A MUSKET SHOOTS OFF The race begins The
trainees sprint toward the obstacle course Nawi Ode and
three other girls are in the lead -- they LAUNCH THEMSELVES
ONTO THE BRAMBLES climbing through but THORNS tear at their
flesh and sink into their skin They ignore the pain
scrambling over and into

THE OOZING MUD They struggle to push through slipping and
falling

MALIK is blown away by Nawi’s athleticism She is light on
her feet and stays upright Nanisca watches the display with
critical eyes

Nawi reaches the wall first tries to climb but her feet
slip She takes her rope the knot pre-tied and THROWS IT UP
LOOPING IT ONTO A SPIKE AT THE TOP OF THE WALL

She yanks it tight and starts climb it up leaving Ode and
the other’s in the mud behind but as she looks down she
sees

FUMBE tries to copy her Fumbe throws her rope but HER KNOT
SLIPS FREE and she falls back into the mud

NAWI near the top of the wall sees her friend
ON IZOGIE watching from the sideline

IZOGIE (CONTD)
(mutters --)
No no

ON NAWI She wants to win so badly but she calls out to
Fumbe motions to her to throw her rope Fumbe does Nawi
LEANS OUT FINGERS BARELY CATCHING IT She quickly ties the
knot and loops it around a spike as Ode reaches the top

ON THE DAISNanisca sees her do this Sees fumbe now
climning up

Nawi turns to continue her own raceODE IS NOW AHEAD
clamoring down the wall Nawi ignores her rope LEAPS down
crashing to the ground hard Stunned she lays there Ode
lands safely takes off running Nawi scrambles up RACES
through an open area where male soldiers pretend to be enemy
soldiers and PELT THE TRAINEES with rocks They both take the
hits but Nawi has caught up THEY ARE NECK AND NECK

Nawi and Ode face one more task at the end of the clearing
Nawi’s old nemesis THE ROW OF DUMMIES with their stick
heads

Nawi finds another level of speed sprinting hard taking the
lead over Ode She draws her machete she spins the
machete in her two hands as she SLICES OFF THE HEAD Cleanly
It goes FLYING through the air rolls in the dirt

Nawi stalks over lifts the dummy head and HOLDS IT UP TO THE
CROWD NAWI WINS THE RACE

THE WATCHING CROWD of Agojie townsfolk and male soldiers
CHEER Malik is dumbstruck Completely taken by this young
woman so different from what he has ever known

ON NAWI the victor She stands still breathless sweat
glistening on her skin She glances back

AT THE WALL two trainees who failed the test are weeping as
Esi escorts them away

Nawi turns back as the handsome Ghezo walk down the steps
from the dais crossing to her She gulps She has never been
this close to the young king who she and her people adore

NAWI
(bows )
My King

GHEZO
Tell me your name

NAWI
(such a moment)
I am Nawi

ANGLE ON MALIK hearing her name

GHEZO
You are as beautiful as you are
fierce If you were not so skilled
at warfare I would have made you a
wife

Some laughter from the assembled dignitaries He gestures and
Tanonu steps forward He has a machete on a fabric cushion
Ghezo takes it in two hands presents it to Nawi It has a
beautifully carved handle

GHEZO (CONTD)
To the victor

She takes the weapon honored and catches eyes with
NANISCA who nods her approval A CONNECTION Nawi feels a
surge of happiness of acceptance as she turns to walk away
allowing a huge smile to bloom on her face

GHEZO (CONTD)
(to all the trainees --)
You have done well All of you

ON ODE watching with jealousy still breathless Nawi sees
her She goes to her and they EMBRACE honoring each other

INT PALACE - AGOJIE BARRACKS - LATE DAY 78
The trainees are helped by servants and comrades who tend to

their wounds Nawi lays on a mat as Izogie tries to dig out
a thorn Nawi winces and moves her foot

IZOGIE
Be still

Nawi grits her teeth Izogie pulls out the thorn LONG AND
SHARP

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Why did you return to help Fumbe
You could have lost

NAWI
Fumbe is my friend I want her to
stay To stay she must pass the
test

Nanisca and Amenza appearing behind Izogie

NANISCA
To be useful she must stand on her
own

NAWI

(nodding toward Amenza)
You would not help your friend
Miganon

NANISCA
Amenza I would step on her head to
win a foot race

Amenza laughs a little but then wonders Nanisca crouches in
front of Nawi She picks up her arm examining the cuts

NANISCA (CONTD)
Your first scars The mark of a
warrior

She holds out her own arm matching it to Nawi’s

NANISCA (CONTD)
You see You will have many more

Nawi drinks in the closeness like oxygen Amenza watches
surprised by Nanisca’s attention Nanisca shows Nawi’s cuts
to Izogie

NANISCA (CONTD)
Make sure all the thorns come out
Here and here

She turns the arm and then stops She sees something She
holds Nawi’s arm stretched out

NANISCA (CONTD)
What is this

ON THE SIDE OF NAWI’S ARM HER SCAR We’ve seen it before
Mr Abade touched it when he examined her to be his bride

NAWI
My father called it the devil’s
mark It was there when he chose me
in the orphanage

Nanisca looks at Nawi’s face Searching it now as if it’s
the first time she’s really looked at her

NANISCA
You are an orphan But your
father

NAWI
Took me in I guess I didn’t turn
out to be the daughter they wanted

Nanisca drops Nawi’s arm Nawi touches the scar not noticing
that Nanisca has left walking out of the barracks Past
servants wives eunuchs but she sees none of them

PRESENT - INT NANISCA’S CHAMBERS - SHORT TIME LATER 80

Nanisca bursts into her room With a shaking hand she pours

herself some water but doesn’t drink Amenza joins her
AMENZA

Nanisca the festival continues
the King requests your presence

Nanisca looks at her Amenza can see something is very wrong

NANISCA
What did you do with it
Amenza is frozen for a moment and then she knows
AMENZA

You told me never to tell you

NANISCA
I am asking

AMENZA
You said you would ask and you
made me swear never to tell you

Nanisca pounds her fist on the table Amenza raises her chin

AMENZA

saw them We passed them on the
road when we were marching

NANISCA
Which way were they going

AMENZA
I don’t remember I did what you
asked you told me to take the
child and I chose to give her away

Nanisca sits on the bed

AMENZA (CONTD)
Why do you ask these questions

FERREIRA
(in Portuguese)

What is this talk of stopping the
slave trade

GHEZO
Speak my language when you are in
my palace You have the words

Ferreira is on his heels Not so confident in the language

FERREIRA
Your wife said you seek an end to
slaving

GHEZO

She does not speak for me And she
will be punished for thinking she
does

FERREIRA
Your Agojie general wishes this

GHEZO
My generals obey my wishes

FERREIRA
So you wish to sell palm oil

GHEZO
I want my people to prosper as
those in your lands do

FERREIRA
(forgetting himself)
But the slave trade makes you rich
As rich as the King of England If
you stop the tradethe money
goes The captains will take their
business to another king

GHEZO
Their business of selling Africans

FERREIRA
Not all the white captains are your
friend You will be unprotected

Ghezo hears this A small hard smile appears on his face

GHEZO
I am under no illusions that you
see us as anything but commerce
But I am a king This is my land
And if you do not come to my shores
to trade what I wish to trade it
is you who are unprotected

Ferreira quickly backs off realizing that to anger Ghezo in
this palace could mean imminent death

stand behind him She carefully lays her hands on his
shoulders begins to knead his muscles carefully uses her
delicate fingers to find the relief he seeks

see you as a savior from the ills
of your brother From the Oyo
murderers They want to see Oyo
suffer to see every Oyo bound and
chained on a slave ship That is

will make Dahomey richer and more
feared than any king before you We

adds HER OWN BLOOD her forearm scarred with dozens of nicks

Nanisca stands before them Nawi looks at her expecting to
see in her eyes what she saw before a connection the
favorite But she is surprised to see NANISCA’S EYES ARE
EMPTY She simply studies Nawi as she gives the oath

NANISCA
Do you dedicate your life to your
King and to your Agojie sisters

I do

NANISCA
Will you lay down your life for the
people of Abomey foreswearing all
others children family the
company of men

Nawi’s eyes search waiting for Nanisca to meet them but
Nanisca’s eyes do not return to her

Amenza pours a clear-colored spirit from a pottery pitcher
into the bowl Sprinkles a powder inside it Mixes the
liquid The women all stand together each in turn SIPPING
FROM THE BOWL The new Agojie chant with Amenza

AMENZA
Blood of our sisters

RECRUITS
Blood of our sisters

AMENZA
Make us invincible

RECRUITS
Make us invincible

AMENZA
You live for me and I for you

NANISCA says the words but her eyes are distant NAWI is
upset confused

INT PALACE - AGOJIE BARRACKS - NIGHT 85

The Agojie women prepare for bed laughing feeling good
Fumbe and Ode sit together comparing their new scars Nawi
sits on her mat Izogie sits behind her braiding her hair

IZOGIE
You are now my sister my equal I
will be proud to fight with you

NAWI
I want you to teach me as Nanisca
teaches you I want to be great
IZOGIE
You must focus There can be no
distractions

NAWI

IZOGIE

IZOGIE
And you like him

NAWI
I have no way to know if I like him
or not

Beat

NAWI (CONTD)
Why can we not love and be
soldiers too

IZOGIE
It makes us weak

NAWI
Have you not felt love

IZOGIE
I do not think about love I think
about greatness I want to be
Miganon one day

NAWI
And that is enough

IZOGIE
It is a hard life we have chosen
We survive in our own way You must
find yours

Nawi takes in her words

EXT PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - LATE NIGHT 86

Nawi walks along the wall shadowed from the moonlight She
comes to the door Izogie once led her through sneaking
out

EXT WATERFALL - SHORT TIME LATER 87
Malik and Nawi walk near the waterfall talking

MALIK
As a boy my mother told me about
Africa About this place And the
women warriors

NAWI
What did she say about us

MALIK
That you were proud and strong And
feared I thought they were just
stories

NAWI
I grew up with those stories too
It made me dream that one day I
could matter

MALIK
My mother was a slave That is all
I knew of African people I never
dreamed that we were warriors and
kings Now I see the majesty
The beauty

He looks at Nawi She feels his gaze

NAWI
You did not see the beauty in her

He looks away Ashamed
MALIK

My father’s blood gave me my
freedom Made me feel that I was

different But I am my mother’s
child That is who I am Who I want
to be

NAWI

I think you are a good man You
must not ally yourself with slavers
like Ferreira
MALIK
We grew up together

NAWI
Does he see our beauty as you do

Malik takes this in Quiet for a moment Then --

MALIK
Nawi The Oyo are coming

NAWI
We are ready

MALIK
Not just the Oyo Other tribes
too I heard their general

This makes her grow solemn

She rises

She looks

She opens

NAWI
I must tell the Miganon We must go
back
to go He catches her hand

MALIK
Wait Tomorrow we will be gone

at his hand on her skin

NAWI
You will return

MALIK
I want to

the little leather bag at her waist and takes

a small charm

NAWI
This is Ogou he is courage and
strength Perhaps he will bring you
back to us

MALIK
I have nothing for you

out

Beat then she puts her hand on his hip and relieves him
of A DAGGER IN A SHEATH on his belt

He smiles

feeling a

a little She smiles back She leans in and kisses
him on the lips Surprising them both She looks down

surge of attraction that makes her heart ache

She’s shy again He holds out his hand to her to help her on
the slippery rocks

MALIK (CONTD)
Ill take you back

This gentlemanly gesture is foreign to her She smiles and
walks over the rocks with ease herself He follows

INT PALACE - BATHS - SHORT TIME LATER 89

Moonlight shines off the water Nawi comes in looking for
Nanisca She sees her sitting at the edge legs immersed

Nawi moves next to her The water soothes her aching feet

NAWI
Miganon I have heard something
The man with Ferreira His name is
Malik He heard the Oyo General
speak of a plan to grow his army
with other tribes

Nanisca knows who this must be

NANISCA
The Mahi and Egbo The Oyo have
given them courage

Beat then --

NANISCA (CONTD)
Malik You sneak out on the night
you take your blood oath to meet
with a slaver

NAWI
He is not a slaver

NANISCA
You defend him

NAWI
His mother was Dahomey

NANISCA
Come here

Nawi steps into the water
NANISCA (CONTD)

You do not understand the dangers
you face you disobey the rules

NAWI
What do you want from me I have
beaten them all I showed I am the
best

NANISCA
It is not enough to be the best

NAWI
Why Because you were captured
That will never be me

A pause

NANISCA
I was raped Many times each night
I knew nothing of the ways of men
When they would come I wished only
to die

Nawi listens moved

NANISCA (CONTD)

And when I escaped I was with
child The child of those men I
took a drink a potion that
takes the child away But the drink
did not work I did not want to
leave the palace -- I hid my belly
I bathed alone I asked for distant

missions and one day the baby
came
FLASHBACK - EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT 92

In the jungle Young Nanisca gives birth squatting holding
onto a thick low tree branch Amenza is with her She has a
flask with liquor she cleans a dagger

Young Nanisca pushes bearing down Fights her SCREAM The
baby slips out bloody crying

NANISCA (VO)
It was a girl I told Amenza to
take it away

Young Amenza severs the cord between her and the baby

NANISCA
But the blood it kept coming She
left me alone with the baby and
went in search of something to stop
the bleeding

FLASHBACK - EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT 94

Young Nanisca looks at the little creature a baby born of
violence and pain The baby opens her toothless mouth to CRY
her little face scrunched and then her eyes open

She looks right into Nanisca’s eyes Nanisca feels a pull
her body her mind drawn to this child

NANISCA (VO)
And in that moment I did
something I made a mark A cut On
the left arm

Nanisca sees AMENZA’S DAGGER lying near She picks it up
brings the knife to the baby’s skin and makes a small CUT on
the side of the infant’s upper arm

THE BABY CRIES Young Nanisca drops the knife Her hand
trembling reaches to her shark’s tooth necklace

She YANKS OFF A SMALL TOOTH PRESSES IT into the cut and
under the skin The baby shrieks Nanisca scoops up a fistful
of mud and PATS IT ON THE ARM pressing it stopping the
blood

NANISCA (VO)
Into the flesh I pressed a tooth A
shark’s tooth

PRESENT - INT BATHS - LATE NIGHT 95
Nawi’s eyes go to Naniscato the NECKLACE SHE WEARS

NANISCA
She had to know That someday if
she met a girl a girl who had
this scar she could cut the flesh
and see if the tooth is inside

ON NAWI Almost unconsciously her hand goes to her arm --
And then with a rustle of water she moves to go Nanisca
stops her GRABS HER WRIST

Nawi’s arm stretches between them their eyes are glued
NAWI
(whispers )

It isn’t me

Nawi now sees Nanisca’s dagger on the stone edge of the
bath it has been lying there all this time

Nanisca picks it up Nawi swallows She relaxes ever so
slightly She does want to know She grits her teeth as
Nanisca presses the dagger to the white mark of the scar and
slices it open

Nanisca presses her fingers INTO THE CUT and Nawi yelps
WRENCHES HER ARM AWAY

Nawi sits on the edge of the bath and with a growl SQUEEZES
HER ARM Blood pours from the wound dripping out in huge
droplets onto the wet stone rim as the blood mixes with
the thin film of water they see it lying theresomething
WHITE glinting swimming in the red

Nanisca stares down at the TOOTH mesmerized Nawi does too
Then she looks up at Nanisca Nanisca looks back at her THE
TRUTH PALPABLE BETWEEN THEM Nawi struggles to find her
words And then --

Nawi leaves She stumbles out of the baths overcome with
emotions and even fear at this impossible truth

NANISCA is spent She holds the shark’s tooth guilt and
conflict in her eyes

EXT PALACE SQUARE - LATE NIGHT 96

Nawi in her wet shift walks across the empty courtyard the
bravado she summoned leaving her like a breath as tears
come Alone now she lets the true feelings hit her She is
lost Broken A RAINDROP Splashes off her hand Another
splats on her head Then she sees the rain all around huge
drops pock the dusty ground

Nawi looks back at her home the palace A long beat and
then she sinks to the ground Burying her head in her
arms as the rain turns the dust around her to mud

EXT PALACE COURTYARD - DAWN 97

Nawi awakens lying on the ground by the palace gates For a
moment peace And then the truth rushes back to her She
stands Her hair and face crusted with mud She walks toward
the inner courtyard feeling empty abandoned

EXT PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - SHORT TIME LATER 98

Nawi comes through the palm curtain There is no one outside
As she passes under the thatched awning NANISCA IS
THERE standing some distance away Their eyes meet and
thenNAWI feels anger She has to turn away going within

Camera holds on Nanisca swallowing back any feeling

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY 99

A scouting party Nanisca with Amenza and Izogie as well as
the Migan and TWO OF HIS MEN hide in the rocks at the tip of
a slope peering out to the valley below The Migan uses
Captain Ferreira’s spyglass to look out over the fields

SPYGLASS POV IT’S MISTY hard to make out details

NANISCA
What do you see

MIGAN
A field of men

SPYGLASS POV In his glass men marching on foot and on
horseback Enslaved men pulling cannons It’s a huge
invading army

Nanisca takes the glass from him and looks herself

NANISCA
They will set up camp at the foot
of the plateau It is the only
place for such an enormous army
with marsh surrounding us

MIGAN
We are greatly outnumbered

NANISCA
Their size makes them arrogant And
slow Clumsy like their weapons
the guns don’t work at all if the
powder is wet

The Migan looks at herstarting to see

MIGAN
We drive them back to the marsh
yes but how

Nanisca bends squatting to a NEARBY TERMITE MOUND She
fingers the red powder thinks of Nawi

NANISCA
You don’t need a gun to use
gunpowder

EXT OPEN FIELDS AT FOOT OF PLATEAU - DAY 102

IN A DARKER PLACE QUIET Someone prepares for battle
CLOSE SHOTS

A HAND with thickened nails being lifted from a bowl of
brine The nails are FILED with a crude metal file to SHARP
POINTS like talons

TWO CUFFS clasp onto both wrists

HANDS smear oil from a pottery bowl onto dark skin arms
belly legs feet

A small cloth bag filled with fetishes and charms is tied
to the belt

A BEAUTIFULLY CARVED MACHETE tested by fingers for
sharpness slides into a BELT at the waist next to MALIK’S
DAGGER We finally reveal this warrior’s face

IT’S NAWI She looks fierce and coldly confident

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - NIGHT 105

The FULL ARMY OF AGOJIE stand in formation Nanisca stands on

NANISCA
For ninety years Dahomey has lived
under the thumb of the Oyo

CAMERA PANS THE FACES OF THE AGOJIE Finds Nawi eyes dark as
steel her face blank as stone painted with dried mud

NANISCA (CONTD)
Will we allow our nation to die in
the hull of ships bound for distant
shores Or will we rise up And
stride into battle screaming to
those who would enslave usNo
more We fight now for those who
will come after us For the future
of our kingdom We are the sword of
victory We are the blade of
freedom We are Dahomey

The Agojie raise their weapons and cheer shout and holler
Except Nawi She stands in cold silence Drums begin to play
the PALACE GATES are pulled open by the Eunuchs

Ghezo stands before Nanisca his hand clasps her shoulder

GHEZO
You are my champion

begins a TROT on foot out of the castle Amenza Izogie
Tara Nawi Fumbe Ode and all their comrades follow feet
pounding the dirt The men FALL IN BEHIND

The Oyo have indeed made a massive encampment at the foot of
the plateau Tents are everywhere and dotted throughout
something these tribes are used to seeing everywhere TERMITE
MOUNDS

The army is just beginning to stir A few Oyo soldiers carry
pales of oats and water toward THE HORSES kept in a
makeshift pen standing together scores of them

NAWI and IZOGIE creep amongst the horses who seem to sense
them They stamp breath steaming from their nostrils Izogie
gets the gate of the pen open Nawi shoos the horses out
making them run TOWARD THE TREELINE

THE GROOMSMEN CALL AN ALARM -- but their voices are drowned
in the drum of the HOOF BEATS THE HORSES ARE POURING OUT
Nawi and Izogie run with them dodging the LARGE TERMITE
MOUNDS THAT DOT THE OPEN FIELD

Soldiers rush from their tents People shout a guard fires a
MUSKET which only scares the horses more They RUN AWAY into
the dawn

Izogie and Nawi run into the bank of trees where they find

THE FOREST IS FULL OF DAHOMEY TROOPS waiting

THEIR COMRADES HIDING THERE Hundreds There are both
Agojie troops led by Nanisca and behind them the male
soldiers the Migan leading them in his own leather armor
Nanisca stands there watching the Oyo encampment mustering

EXT ENCAMPMENT —- SAME TIME 107

The massive army starts forward toward the tree line

EXT BOTTOM OF THE PLATEAU - SAME TIME 108
NANISCA is handed a torch It illuminates her face for a
brief moment and then she touches it to the ground where
a small pool of palm oil sits The OIL IGNITES A WOOSH OF

FLAME Oil trails have been set the fire follows the fuel
racing in trails to

EXT OYO ENCAMPMENT - SAME TIME 109

The TERMITE MOUNDS Which have been planted with gunpowder
When the fire hits these they IGNITE AND EXPLODE like bombs

The mustering Oyo and Mahi forces SHOUT in terror Their

chaotic melee

OBA
To the marsh

The Oyo race toward safety coughing from the oily black
smoke They leave behind crates of ammunition which begin to
EXPLODE from the heat and sparks MEN ARE SENT FLYING

EXT MARSH - MOMENTS LATER 110
The Oyo forces break through the tree-line a huge loud mass
of men scrambling into the mud and water of the marsh
struggling their weapons dripping in the water

EXT TREELINE - SAME TIME 111
Amenza Nawi and the others wait

THEIR POV

Across the marsh they see NANISCA appear raising her
machete

NANISCA
Eh-lele m’eh-le-le

Her Agojie warriors answer in a roar of women’s voices

AGOJIE WARRIORS
Eh-lele m’eh-le-le

The whole AGOJIE army CHARGES INTO THE MARSH They ATTACK the
gasping Oyo The Migan and the MALE DAHOMEY WARRIORS appear
behind them

In the wet marsh MUDDY FROM THE PREVIOUS RAIN the Oyo’s
muskets are rendered useless And the fire has cut off any
escape The marsh becomes a sea of humanity men and woman
FIGHTING TO THE DEATH in hand to hand combat

ANGLE ON OBA

In the middle of the fray seeing his men are in trouble He
starts SLICING THROUGH BODIES

IN THE FIELD

Nanisca and Amenza battle men behind and in front of them
both covered with mud and blood

THROUGH SMOKE that fills the wet air we see the MIGAN
fighting alongside his male soldiers swinging his machete
with ferocity

Oyo soldiers savage in their desperation KEEP COMING AT
THEM hurling themselves

OBA is a mountain of fury swinging his sword at the Agojie
in his path He cuts down TWO WARRIORS when ESI raises her
spear against him He swings at her and she blocks the
blade counters and cuts him Enraged he catches her spear
as she swings again breaks it across his knee She rushes at
himand catches his blade in her chest She drops to her
knees dying Not satisfied he raises his machete to sever
her from her life for good

ANOTHER AREA

FUMBE fighting for her life An Oyo soldier overpowers
her knocking away her machete As the man is about to STRIKE
HER DOWN Fumbe finds within her the fight She ducks the
machete and RUSHES the man knocking him down With her BARE
HANDS she shoves his FACE DOWN INTO THE MUDDY MARSH holding
it there with all her strength He twitches and struggles

ANOTHER OYO soldier is BEHIND HER he raises his axe to slice
her wide open whena BLADE suddenly punches through the
front of his chest BLOOD SPURTS FROM HIS MOUTH and he FALLS

IZOGIE is there She pulls her machete from the man’s back
takes the deadman’s axe and throws it to Fumbe who has to
turn immediately to block a blow from a new foe

FIND NAWI slicing the men in her way with a RAGE and
FEARLESSNESS SMALL AND FAST Seemingly untouchable

And then she is grabbed from behind by a HUGE OYO SOLDIER
lifted into the air and slammed to the ground Her head RINGS
from the impact

HER POV The Huge Oyo warrior heads toward her

Nawi stays low as he nears She suddenly WHIPS HER MACHETE
across his legs and he stumbles bringing him to his knees
she slices through his chest and he FALLS pinning her under
his girth She grunts using her arms to push STRUGGLING to
get free BUT WHEN OYO SOLDIERS APPROACH she stops FEIGNS
DEATH closing her eyes stilling her breath

Oyo feet stomp around her Then one pair of feet slows An
OYO SOLDIER CROUCHES looking down at her He takes out his
dagger to slit her throat when

Nawi’s eyes SNAP OPEN His eyes go wide with fright and in
that frozen instant Nawi JABS TWO SHARP FINGERNAILS INTO HIS
EYES He grabs his face blinded Drops his dagger She
catches it SLITS HIS THROAT He slumps and dies in the mud

Nawi resumes her attempt to get free digging with her hands
at the mud

EXT A ROCKY OUTCROPPING - SAME TIME 112

A few Oyo soldiers have found a hiding place that gives them
time and space to load and fire MUSKETS but we see just as
Nanisca has always said how unwieldy the weapons are how
SLOW the men are to reload As they fumble and shout at each
other they see emerging through the smoke of the oil
fires A LONE WARRIOR machete in hand NANISCA

One of the Oyo finishes loading a weapon gets it to his
shoulder tries to aim his shot but the KICKBACK is
tremendous

Nanisca with reflexes honed from many battles ducks as THE
MUSKET BALL whizzes past her head THE SHOOTER CAN’T BELIEVE
IT he sees her RISING AGAIN She starts to run toward
them The shooter YELLS at the others to load

ON A SOLDIER gun jamming from the moisture of the marsh
In other words HE’S FUCKED

Nanisca is ON THEM KICKING the gun out of one soldier’s hand
while SLICING OFF THE HEAD of another The third one drops
his gun and tries to run NANISCA THROWS HER DAGGER and
lodges it between his shoulder blades

She picks up the muskets and TOSSES THEM to male Dahomey
soldiers approaching behind her Together they continue their
drive TOWARD THE BURNING ENCAMPMENT

ODE comes upon a CANNON unmanned She struggles to move the
heavy beast TURN IT AROUND point it at a group of
approaching OYO SOLDIERS The men FIRE ON HER Ode takes a
BULLET to the SHOULDER just as Tara and a group of Agojie
run forward in danger from the row of Oyo snipers Ode
cranks the cannon in their direction and LIGHTS IT

Just as the Oyo raise their guns THE CANNON EXPLODES The
Oyo soldiers are BLOWN INTO THE AIR Tara sees what Ode’s
done and raises a fist to her

TARA
Yes

She raises her machete leads her soldiers after the
retreating Oyo Ode charges with them but no one sees HER
SUDDENLY STUMBLE FALL TO HER KNEES TRYING TO BREATHE the
fight chaotic all around her

soldiers with cowrie breastplates standing over the foe

ELSEWHERE we follow NANISCA on a mission She grabs
wounded Oyo soldiers brings them to her face

look of triumph

The brave Dahomey soldiers men and women begin to CHEER
with relief and triumph Nanisca allows herself some pride in
this moment

EXT CORNER OF THE MARSH —- DAY 115

Nawi hears the distant cheers She FREES HERSELF from under
the dead Oyo She can barely stand finding herself in a SEA
OF THE DEAD She draws her machete begins to move hearing
the cheers of her comrades Then she hears a sound like a
woman’s voice muffled

She tries to place it the sound is not too far off she
turns toward a dark stand of trees where she thinks the
sound is coming from It comes again

Nawi moves toward the TREES Her eyes scanning enters the
area eerily quiet She hearsA GUN COCKING

Several Oyo men step out from behind the trees Among them
OBA The men grab Nawi who starts kicking and screaming

As she fights biting getting hit a foot smashes against
her back and PRESSES HER TO THE GROUND Nawi FINDS STRENGTH
to still FIGHT until THEY SMASH HER HEAD with the butt of a
musket Everything goes BLACK

EXT PLAINS - LATE DAY 116
SOUNDS a rattling the thumping of horse’s hoovesNAWI

as her eyes OPEN her face is cut and her eyes swollen She
turns her head to see

A DEAD AGOJIE her glassy eyes staring Nawi lies ina
SHALLOW WAGON with six other Agojie feet bound and hands
bound to each other Nawi tries to LIFT HER HEAD to see

HER POV Two horses pull the flatbed wagon An Oyo soldier
drives the carriage whipping the horses Beyond the carriage
she can make out another flatbed wagon and FOUR MORE OYO
SOLDIERS on horseback galloping ahead

NAWI tries to shift her body She stifles a gasp as A HAND
dangling a rope comes across the dead body to touch her She
hears a whispered voice --

FUMBE (0C)
Nawi

The hand pats her Fumbe’s FACE appears peering over the
dead woman to see Nawi The two stare at each other THE
WAGON RATTLES ON The girls speak in the quietest way almost
reading each other’s lips

FUMBE (CONTD)
I failed

NAWI
No You stayed alive

Nawi though her face is swollen and bloody is able to give
her an encouraging smile Then she sees the dangling rope on
Fumbe’s arm

NAWI (CONTD)
You are not tied to anyone

Fumbe shakes her head

NAWI (CONTD)
What is behind you

Fumbe shakes her head she can’t hear

NAWI (CONTD)
The edge Are you at the edge

Fumbe looks behind her She is at the edge of the wagon
against a wooden lip about six inches She turns back to
Nawi and nods The wagon RUMBLES over rocks causing it to
JUMP before settling again Nawi and Fumbe’s eyes are glued

NAWI (CONTD)
Go over the side

Fumbe realizes what she’s saying She shakes her head no

NAWI (CONTD)
You want to live

The wagon rattles

NAWI (CONTD)
Do it When I say

Fumbe breathes scared They HIT ANOTHER BUMP joggle

NAWI (CONTD)
(emphatic whisper --)
Now

Fumbe’s eyes go wide and she ROLLS TO HER LEFT violently
shoving herself OFF of the wagon with all her strength

AS THE WAGON bounces back down with a rattle Nawi’s eyes
stare toward the muddy rocky road She sees FUMBE lying in
the road Her form RECEDES as the WAGON hurtles away Nawi
rests her head back breathing with relief

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - NIGHT 117

The Agojie soldiers bloody but victorious return through
the huge open doors of the palace Ghezo stands in the center
of the parade ground in magnificent kingly robes awaiting
their return beaming with pride Shante nearby He sees

NANISCA entering the palace He strides to her Puts his
hands on her shoulders

GHEZO
You have brought Dahomey a victory
for the ages Your name will be
remembered songs will be sung

She bows her head accepts his praise as he moves past her
to embrace the Migan

Wounded Agojie and male soldiers are everywhere having their
wounds tended by the Eunuchs and the palace doctors

NANISCA walks through the throng of soldiers her eyes
scanning the faces of the injured Agojie warriors

HER POV Tara is kneeling at the corpse of Ode She takes a
fetish from her bag and lays it on the forehead of this young
soldier who saved her life

Nanisca watches Ode being honored when Amenza approaches

AMENZA
The mighty Oyo have run away in
defeat

Nanisca is not celebrating Amenza notes her general’s eyes
searching

shirks off the tender touch and walks away

Oba peers at the bounty of his otherwise lost battle Even
bloody and tired the Agojie muscular and proud stand out
amongst the other people in the crowded barracoon He points
to the group

OBA (CONTD)

blend in with the other captives

EXT BARRACOONS - LATE NIGHT 120
Torches lit A NEW GROUP OF CAPTIVES are pushed into the

overcrowded pens already filled with men and women They are
SPLASHED with buckets of water

BUCKETS OF YAM are set along the open rails of the pen The
captives RUSH at it their hands reaching through the bars
scrambling for the food

NAWI lets the people rush around her and away from her She
doesn’t care to eat She realizes there is one other person
like her in the pen just standing there not caring -- the
person is far down at the other end Their heads turn to
look at each other

IT IS IZOGIE

Nawi walks toward her Izgogie is wounded her arm BROKEN and
hanging at a strange angle Nawi embraces her Izogie winces
from the pain

Nawi leans Izogie against the fence She leaves for a moment
then comes back with a piece of yam Izogie refuses it The
light seems to have gone from her eyes

NAWI
Eat We need our strength if we’re
going to escape

A dry bark of laughter escapes Izogie’s throat

IZOGIE
I know what I must do What the
Miganon said We will slit our
throats

NAWI
(firm)
You will do no such thing

Izogie hears a deep reserve of toughness in Nawi
NAWI (CONTD)
We are Agojie Relentlessly we will

fight

NAWI (CONTD)
-my arm is broken

NAWI (CONTD)
We do not give up

Izogie looks at her Long beat then --

IZOGIE
Take my arm

Nawi stretches it out Izogie winces then she feels for the
ends of the broken bone She motions for Nawi to take over

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Push it back together

Nawi finds the ends Pushes them back into realignment
Izogie CHOKES BACK A SCREAM OF PAIN She falls back The arm
looks straighter undamaged

IZOGIE (CONTD)
Youre strong for a little bug

A slight laugh They’re both overwhelmed by the moment the
necessity the bind they are in

NAWI
Now what

Izogie looks all around them taking everything in The SLAVE
MARKET beyond the pens It is an open dirt square

EXT ROAD TO ABOMEY - EARLY MORNING 121

A cock crows somewhere A SHEPHERD herds a few long horn
cattle down the mostly empty streets when he peers seeing
something a site that almost scares him

A FIGURE is stumbling down the road plastered in mud A
FILTHY ROPE still attached to her arm

IT’S FUMBE We see her face determined she opens her mouth
to call to the man but her voice comes out in a croak She
falls on her knees The Shepherd runs to help her

INT PALACE - AGOJIE BARRACKS - MORNING 122

Fumbe lies on her mat medicine women applying poultices to
her wounds Amenza oversees laying a cloth on her forehead
Agojie peering at Fumbe suddenly part making way for
Nanisca who comes to the mat looking down at Fumbe

NANISCA
You were taken captive

FUMBE
By Oyo men One was a general

NANISCA
Oba

FUMBE
Yes That is the name

NANISCA
How many others

FUMBE
Six or seven Nawi said to throw
myself off the wagon

NANISCA
Nawi

FUMBE
They were taking us to the
barracoons

This hits Nanisca hard Her eyes meet Amenza’s Before she
can speak Tanonu appears

TANONU
Miganon The King requests you

123 INT PALACE - THRONE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER 123

Nanisca enters surprised to see ALL THE KING’S WIVES
sitting waiting Shante is the only one who turns to look at
Nanisca

After a moment Ghezo appears attended by servants and
Tanonu who carries a three-legged stool a portable throne
that he sets down for Ghezo

GHEZO
The women in this room are the best
Dahomey has to offer The women the
King has chosen to hold close to
his heart I have brought you here
because tomorrow I am going to make
an announcement

(a beat)

I have chosen my reign mate the
Kpojito

Shante smiles to herself

GHEZO (CONTD)
The Kpojito is beloved of the
people She must be deserving of
their admiration their trust And
we must share a vision for our
future A bold vision For this
reason I have chosen Nanisca

ON NANISCA quietly struck her eyes meeting Ghezo’s He
smiles at her But Shante is livid She rises

SHANTE
She is a common soldier

GHEZO
Wife You will sit down

She stamps out of the room The other wives exchange glances

GHEZO (CONTD)

(to Tanonu)
Go to her

(to the wives)
Kelu Iniya you will aid Nanisca
Make her robes We will put ona
great feast Invite the city into
the palace In three days time we
will announce it And announce an
end to the trade

The other wives go out leaving only Ghezo and Nanisca A
beat

NANISCA
My king It is a great honor But
perhaps it is too soon When we
have lost so many soldiers and the
people are grieving

GHEZO
Grieving No one is grieving We
have won we have thrown off the
yoke We must declare it far and
wide we must let the people know

NANISCA
My king I wish to seek our lost
Agojie Some were taken captive

GHEZO
How many

NANISCA
Six or seven

Ghezo looks at her surprised
GHEZO
If they were captured they are
weak

He sees the hesitation in her eyes

NANISCA
They will be sold Used by the men

GHEZO
Nanisca The moment you seek is
upon us The few have been
sacrificed for the many We must
now move forward --

NANISCA
I can go alone Let me try

Ghezo’s eyes grow hard

GHEZO
Do not mistake my admiration for
weakness I am the King You will
not seek these captives You will
stay by my side and take the honor
I bestow you

She meets his eyes Nanisca bows and leaves the chamber

EXT PALACE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 124
Amenza is waiting She’s been eavesdropping

AMENZA
You are the Kpojito

She hugs Nanisca to her But we see in Nanisca’s eyes she
isn’t able to feel the accomplishment

EXT THE BARRACOONS - DAY 125

Men with muskets guard the pens always vigilant Oba comes
in to choose the next group to be lead to the block Nawi
and Izogie stand watching him

IZOGIE (VO)
We will be marched out of the
barracoon in small groups

Oba walks through the crowded barracoon touching the arms of
the ones he wants taken to the block He touches the shoulder
of Izogie His men grab her roughly and take her out She
grits her teeth trying not to show any pain as they yank her
about

IZOGIE (VO)
We must stay together We cannot be
separated

Oba looks further walking RIGHT PAST Nawi not choosing her -
- perhaps the plan will be foiled at the outset -- then he
passes Nawi again SHE LOOKS HIM IN THE EYE Could this man

be her father Her flesh and blood He feels her eyes burning
into him He taps her shoulder Nawi’s eyes never leave Oba

as the men take her away

EXT MARKET AREA - SHORT TIME LATER 126

The chosen captives now stand in a line against a wall Men
come along and rip their tops off NOTE There will be no
frontal nudity

IZOGIE (VO)

From this moment on we will have
our legs We will not be tied or
chained

Guards kneel and UNTIE THEIR LEGS Then their hands

Both men and women are ordered to WASH THEMSELVES with
buckets of water and tallow soap guns held on them Nawi and
Izogie are not shy or humiliated They wash their wounds
their faces Their eyes surreptitiously take in the scene

IZOGIE (VO)
We must have patience

Enslaved women approach with their uniforms Dress them

EXT MARKET AREA —- LATER 127

At the blocks the slave ship captains three Europeans
among them FERREIRA poke and prod the captives who now wear
simple sleeveless frocks They lift their lips to look at
their teeth test their muscles IZOGIE takes her place on
the block looking proud in her battle uniform

IZOGIE (VO)
We must not let them see my arm is
broken

The three captains are impressed by Izogie’s athletic body
The fierceness of her gaze Ferreira lifts one arm over her
head then takes the BROKEN ARM and lifts it over her head

ON NAWI holding her breath She sees Izogie’s jaw clench
pushing down the pain Showing no flinch to the white men He
puts down her arm Squeezes her breast

Ferreira and a French captain both want to buy Izogie In an
animated discussion they one-up each other on price Oba
smiles at this Just as he thought the Agojie are valuable

IZOGIE (VO)
You will make a distraction That
will be the moment We will each
disarm a guard and run Don’t stop
until you reach the lagoon

Nawi and Izogie trade glances Ferreira makes the final bid
for Izogie and wins As they come to take Izogie Nawi gets
ready to launch into her distraction

MALIK
Nawi

The slavers turn -- MALIK strides into the market area Yells
at Ferreira in Portuguese --

MALIK (CONTD)
(subtitled --)
What the hell are you doing

FERREIRA
What I came here to do

MALIK
You call them savages It is you
who is savage

FERREIRA
Stay out of this Count yourself
lucky you are not on the block

This comment from Ferreira shocks Malik

ON IZOGIE realizing the whole plan is about to falter She
bashes an ELBOW TO THE FACE of the white slaver to her right
She rips off his musket all around her other captives
take advantage of the shouting and chaos Izogie RUNS out of
the market musket on her back

Nawi runs after her when FERREIRA GRABS HER

NAWI
Let go Let go

ON IZOGIE she’s made it out of the market she’s home

free but hearing Nawi shout she hesitates Not following
her own rule she TURNS BACK She shoves people out of the
way to get back to Nawi Nawi sees her shakes her head NO

Malik pulls Ferreira off Nawi Nawi gets up is about to run
to Izogie when A SHOT RINGS OUT THEN TWO MORE

ON IZOGIE blood blooms across her chestshe CRUMPLES TO
THE GROUND

NAWI (CONTD)
No

Nawi RUNS to her kneeling at her body

NAWI (CONTD)
Izogie

Izogie struggles to rise but her body slumps She coughs up
blood

IZOGIE
Tse-tse You run like a sloth

NAWI
(tears springing)
Please

Izogie grips her hand trying to rise

IZOGIE
Be the sword

Nawi nods throat choked as Izogie’s grip loosens She can’t

go on She dies Nawi weeps the commotion now elsewhere as

guards chase down the other runaways in the dissipating smoke
from the muskets

Malik comes to Nawi Ferreira is not far behind Nawi yells
at them anger and grief in her eyes

NAWI
Get away Get away from her

She covers Izogie’s body with hers Oba looks at Malik

OBA
You want this one It’s one hundred

Nanisca sheaths her machete opens her small fetish bag and
places her charms inside This time adding a new one NAWI’S
SHARK TOOTH

She ties the fetish bag on her belt And then Amenza appears
in the doorway She’s shocked to see Nanisca in battle
gear

AMENZA
What are you doing

NANISCA
Move aside

AMENZA
If you leave you are defying your
king He will expel you Or worse

Nanisca looks at her friend Tries to make her understand

NANISCA
Amenza I know what it is in the
dream -- the thing I’m so
frightened of

(beat)
It is me It is the girl who was
silenced in those shackles by
those men I have hidden her away
I have denied her pain but I am
going to hear her now

(swallowing emotion)
I have to try to save her

Nanisca moves past Amenza and goes out

EXT PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - SHORT TIME LATER 131
Nanisca walks toward the secret door

Through an opening of the palm curtain the Migan sees her
Knows what she is about to do Is he going to stop her Sound
the alarm She disappears from his sight

EXT OUTSIDE THE PALACE WALLS - CONTINUOUS 132
The secret door closes Nanisca stands there a moment
completely alone hearing the air move in the trees She
starts her run even strong heading to the coast

EXT JUNGLE TRAIL - DAWN 133
CLOSE ON NANISCA as the early sun starts its rise still

she runs determined free And then she hears OTHER FEET
pounding the dirt

She turns to see behind her cresting over a hillAMENZA
and a SQUAD OF TWENTY AGOJIE among them FUMBE AND TARA run
toward her And behind them the MIGAN They catch up and
join her running with her Nanisca allows herself a feeling
of relief She runs with her fellow warriors to battle

NAWI
Do you own me now

MALIK
Nawi

NAWI
Get out

MALIK

I’m trying to protect you

NAWI
By locking me in

MALIK
Do you know what these Oyo would do
to you I have to lock you in

He takes her hand and LAYS THE DOOR KEY inside it

MALIK (CONTD)
There You have the key now You
can choose when the lock is turned

Her bloodied fingers close around it She stares at it Beat
then Malik reaches for the washing bowl He pours water from
a pitcher gently washes the blood from her hands with his
As she watches their hands she slowly softens

life where we don’t have to

NAWI
Such a place does not exist

MALIK

Legba’s that you and I in all the
vastness of the world should find
each other

NAWI

loveAfter a moment her mouth finds his

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - DAY 136

The celebration is being prepared -- the dais is built for
the King and his wives The King’s throne is carried out

As Ghezo oversees this Shante and Tanonu appear walking to
him He frowns as Shante bows low

SHANTE
Husband Please accept my deepest
apologies for questioning your
will

GHEZO
(wary )
What do you want

SHANTE
The wives are whispering I came to
Tanonu to tell him what they say
And he has asked me to tell it to
you

GHEZO
(to Tanonu)
I don’t want you discussing my
business with the Tasi

TANONU
My lord Forgive me but it is too
important Nanisca has gone to
Ouidah

TANONU (CONTD)
With the Migan and a number of her
soldiers

Ghezo seethes with fury

GHEZO
We must postpone the feast

Tanonu and shante exchange glances

SHANTE
No The people gossip and share
rumors You cannot postpone it
without looking weak That may be
Nanisca’s intent

GHEZO
What are you saying

SHANTE
My only thought is for you Perhaps
she is looking for more than
Kpojito She led a coup for you
The Agojie will do whatever she
says Can she truly be trusted

Ghezo stares at Shante with both rage and suspicion she
keeps her head down eyes low

EXT OUIDAH - TOWN SQUARE - THE BARRACOONS - NIGHT 137

The square is alive with DRUNKEN SAILORS and general mayhem
MEN from different countries boisterously arguing laughing

IN THE BARRACOONS the captives try to sleep some coughing
a few weeping A TEENAGE GIRL alone in the pen holding her
knees to her chest unable to sleep

MORE GUARDS are posted since the escape attempt of Izogie and
Nawi Both Oyo and White Slavers Two men with blunderbusses
at each of the barracoons and two more in the center market

The men watch the revelry in the lit-up saloons jealous One
of the guards lights a hand-rolled cigarette

SLAP -- a hand comes over his mouth and his THROAT IS SLIT
before he utters a sound His partner meets the same fate
They slump to the ground dead eyes staring through the bars
of the barracoon at THE TEENAGE GIRL Shocked she looks

up

NANISCA puts a finger to her mouth -- motioning the girl to
be quiet

ANOTHER BARRACOON One of the guards is HIT WITH A SPEAR in
his chest He clutches his heart his fellow guard shocked
starts to scream getting out HALF OF A YELL before HE IS
SMASHED IN THE FACE with the butt of AMENZA’S spear

The remaining TWO GUARDS now shout and raise their weapons
but they are too late The MIGAN and TARA STAND from their
hiding place and FIRE THEIR MUSKETS The guards crumple dead
on impact

EXT OUIDAH - TOWN SQUARE - STABLES - SAME TIME 138

Oba and a few of his men eating and drinking outside the
horse stables Oba hears what sounds like musket fire

OBA
What is that

OYO SECRETARY
Just drunken sailors blowing off
steam It happens every night

But Oba rises

EXT OUIDAH - TOWN SQUARE - THE BARRACOONS - SAME TIME 139

The AGOJIE SOLDIERS work quickly knowing the gunfire will
bring more men The captive Agojie bow their heads in
deference and thanks to Nanisca They are handed weapons
They free the rest of the captives -- the stronger men and
women are handed the muskets and other weapons of the fallen
guards Nanisca searches their faces

NANISCA
Where are the others

CAPTIVE AGOJIE
Izogie was killed Miganon Nawi
has not returned

A flicker of emotion in her eyes and then NANISCA hardens
She and three others pull unlit TORCHES and set them into the
dying fire of the guards THEY BURST TO LIFE

IN THE SQUARE the WHITE SAILORS and SLAVE DEALERS see the
approaching hoard of former captives led by Nanisca and the
Agojie who set aflame anything they pass barrels hay
bales piles of wood PEOPLE run shouting frightened Men
start to battle them But their panicked aggression is no
match for the balletic brutality of the Agojie Nanisca and
Amenza cut down man after man before they can even raise
their muskets

ON THE ROOF of the buildings around the square are OYO
SHOOTERS gunshots RING OUT

Several people are killed Nanisca points to the Oyo Shooters
and freed captives rush toward them

AT THE FORT ENTRANCE the thunder of horse’s hooves can be
heard Oba has gathered his last Oyo troops and they RIDE
INTO THE MELEE

INT BOARDING HOUSE - BED CHAMBER - SAME TIME 140

Malik and Nawi lay in bed Malik jumps up waking from the
commotion

MALIK
Stay here

But Nawi rises hearing the shouts rushes onto the BALCONY
overlooking the square

HER POV She sees Agojie warriors battling the slave dealers
She sees Oba and his men on horseback unable to move amidst
the crush of savage fighting

ON NAWI’S FACE she can’t believe it Her sisters have come
to the rescue Shaking with emotion and relief she rushes
back into the room She looks around Lying on the bed is a
DRESS in European style She picks it up She sees the white
lace pantaloons and camisole that are meant to go underneath
She pulls on the pantaloons and the white camisole

She sees Malik’s pistol in a leather belt draped over a
chair She takes it and buckles it around her waist
INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BED CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 141

Ferreira half-dressed and terrified rushes to Malik

FERREIRA
(Portuguese --)
We must go To the ship Forget the
cargo they’ll kill us all

Ferreira hears the cocking of a pistol He turns NAWI POINTS
THE PISTOL AT THEM

NAWI
Move

MALIK
Do not go Nawi you’1ll be killed

Ferreira pulls Malik back and Nawi moves past down the
stairs

MALIK (CONTD)
Nawi

She keeps going

EXT OUIDAH - TOWN SQUARE - SAME TIME 142

The savagery of the battle is the most intense we have seen
The freed captives’ anger propels them onto the sailors and
slavers No one is safe As soon as they kill they grab the
dead man’s weapon and toss it to another fighter

ON OBA his horse afraid of the flames starting to climb up
the walls of the boarding house and customs buildings

Oba takes a whip from his belt and SLAPS HIS HORSE on the
flank the horse surges forward

ON NANISCA killing a shooter Through the smoke through
the scrum of fighting bodies and screaming men she HEARS the
pounding of HORSE’S HOOVES

HER POV Oba has turned his horse and is trying to retreat to
the safety of the fort

NANISCA RUNS TOWARD THE FORT’S GATE

OBA ON HORSEBACK about to gain his freedom when he sees
NANISCA STEPPING UP TO BLOCK the entrance to the fort her
machete drawn

Oba smiles DIGS INTO THE FLANKS OF THE HORSE He’s
galloping DIRECTLY TOWARD HER He intends to run her over
with the terrified beast

ON NANISCA she holds holds the hoofbeats thumping At
the last possible moment she does her spin move and SLICES

THE CHEST OF THE HORSE with the machete before SLIDING AWAY

ON HER KNEES just avoiding being trampled

THE WOUNDED HORSE REARS UP BUCKING OFF OBA He flies off
hitting the ground with a crunch of broken bones The HORSE
runs away crazed

Nanisca stalks to Oba who is on all fours struggling to
crawl away He sees a KNIFE on the ground near him reaches
for it

NANISCA GRABS HIM by his leather coat and TURNS HIM AROUND
HE HAS THE KNIFE He attacks STABBING IT INTO HER SHOULDER
all the way up to the hilt

She stands there He smiles The knife is just below her
shoulder in the chest Did he hit a fatal blow Blood starts
to trickle down her cowrie breast plate

But Nanisca’s face registers nothing No pain no fear She
uses her fist to grab the knife and YANK IT FROM HER FLESH
then she takes one step and PLUNGES IT INTO OBA’S GUT

They stand there like that close together their blood co-
mingling She grits her teeth

NANISCA
You do not remember me

Oba shakes his head no

NANISCA (CONTD)
Now you will never forget

She stabs him again he grunts in pain She KICKS HIM AWAY
He falls backward to the ground eyes staring up DEAD

Nanisca stands breathless looking down at the still body of
her tormentor Then she hears the click of a musket She
turns AN OYO SOLDIER stands before her A MUSKET at his hip
He raises his weapon to shoot Nanisca and then

A SHOT A bullet explodes out of his chest as he falls face
down revealing NAWI her rescuer lowering the pistol
Nawi for the first time sees that Nanisca her mother has
come to rescue her This time NANISCA DOESN’T LOOK AWAY So
much passes between them but before they can say even one
word to each other

WHITE SLAVERS APPROACH running toward them on either side
The two Agojie warriors mother and daughter turn and fight
back to back dispatching them with almost balletic grace

As the men fall they exchange a look Nawi tosses Nanisca a
blunderbuss from one of the dead men Nanisca looks at it
The source of so much horror She tosses it with disdain
Grips her machete Calls to her warriors

NANISCA (CONTD)
Eh-dabo Agojie

EXT OUIDAH SHORELINE - DAWN 143

The shore is chaos the town square in flames A Portuguese
sailor from the ship frantically waves Ferreira and Malik
onto his rowboat as they march with their enslaved captives

Malik stares at the bound men and women Then he rises knife
in hand and cuts the rope that binds them The Krumen as well
as the now-freed Africans pour back toward shore pulling the
Slavers into the water with them FERREIRA TRIES TO ESCAPE
THEY SHOUT AND GRAB HIS ARMS HIS LEGS

FERREIRA
No Malik

Malik turns away Splashes into the water toward a long boat
bobbing there Two Krumen are suddenly beside him He thinks
they are going to drag him back but they get into the boat

AFRICAN KRUMEN
Come brother You cannot stay here

Malik gets in as Ferreira is swallowed up into the violent
crowd screaming

EXT BAY - CONTINUOUS 144

Malik rows with the Krumen He sees NAWI some distance away
with Nanisca and other Agojie women standing on the rocks

THEIR EYES MEET They do not know what the future holds but
for now they must follow their own paths Nawi nods to him
He nods back HIS POV He sees Nawi turn to escape the town
running with her Agojie sisters

EXT HILLS ABOVE OUIDAH - MORNING 145

The Agojie and the Migan lead the escaped captives on a
march At the head of the ragtag group Nawi and Nanisca
walk side by side Amenza is behind them looking at their
body language how similar they are as they walk in front of
her

Nawi looks out to sea A SHIP FLYING THE FLAG OF SPAIN sails
billowing catches the trade winds that will carry it away
from the slave coast

The Agojie veer away from the freed captives who march in
another direction heading for their homes As the Agojie
fall in together THE TEENAGE GIRL from the Barracoons runs
to them to Nawi

TEENAGE GIRL
Take me with you I want to be an
Agojie

Nawi allows her to fall in step with her bringing her along
with this tribe of fierce women

EXT STREETS OF ABOMEY - DAY 146

The small wounded band of Agojie and the Migan As they
trudge down toward the palace all around them the Dahomey
people gather A cheer begins to ripple through the crowd
started by village women but picked up by all

PEOPLE OF ABOMEY
Miganon Miganon

In the crowd Nawi sees some familiar faces her friend
Dayo full of pride Her adoptive parents Moru and Ydande
amazed at her transformation

ON NAWI feeling pride and a sense of belonging that no one
can take away from her She sees ABADE the man who would be
her husband in the crowd She raises her chin in triumph He
sees her then casts his eyes down as is the custom She
smiles

ON NANISCA AND AMENZA they notice the gates to the palace
are open they notice flags flying They move inside
followed by the Agojie women in the rescue party

EXT PALACE - PALACE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 147

They see lines of Agojie warriors male warriors assembled
The dais is occupied with the wives of the King SHANTE IS
THERE ARRAYED MAGNIFICENTLY IN THE PINK SILK ROBE HER HAIR
PILED HIGH And then she hears the commotion of Nanisca and
the band of rescuers entering the courtyard

ON GHEZO in his throne frowning to see Nanisca’s return

He is surprised to hear the people cheering as they flow into
the courtyard behind the Agojie chanting Na-nis-ca Na-nis-
ca” And more significantly “Kpo-ji-to”

ON THE DAIS Ghezo stands with his wives with all of his
ministers from the cabinet He looks around the cheering for
Nanisca echoing in his ears Shante stares daggers at the
crowd She is ready for her own cheers but they do not come

The Migan takes his place among the assembled male warriors

Nanisca walks forward She takes off her machete and lays it
on the ground She bows to King Ghezo laying her head down

into the dirt Ghezo walks down the steps and comes to stand
in front of her He speaks to her -- only her

GHEZO
You disobeyed your king

NANISCA
I will resign my command

A beat He reaches down and picks up her machete It is heavy
in his hands

ON NAWI concerned not sure what will happen ALL
AROUND THE PEOPLE TAKE UP THEIR CHANT AGAIN Na-nis-ca

Ghezo rises to the dais He turns toward the assembled troops
and palace retinue EVERY SOLDIER IN THE PARADE GROUND drops
to a knee and bow their heads

We have ended the rule of the Oyo
Empire

A chant begins low and rhythmic in the male corps

GHEZO
Many never thought it possible But
others had a vision
Ghezo looks at Nanisca
GHEZO (CONTD)
That is what makes a great leader

Seeing what others do not

Nanisca reacts

GHEZO (CONTD)
What the Europeans and the
Americans have seen is that to hold
a people in chains one must first
convince them they are meant to be
bound We have joined them in
becoming our own oppressors No
more No more

Murmurs throughout the crowd His council look at each other

GHEZO (CONTD)
We are a warrior people There is
power in our minds our culture
our unity We are limitless if we
understand our power I will lead
with this vision A vision that is
shared

Ghezo looks at Nanisca

GHEZO (CONTD)
Heroes of Dahomey Behold the
bravest of the brave chosen of

The crowd CHEERS He holds out his hand Nanisca rises and
walks up the steps to the dais She stands with Ghezo who
LIFTS HER ARM Louder CHEERS erupt Music plays Shante sinks
to seated disappointed but unable to deny the will of the
people

ON NANISCA’S FACE there is weariness pride She
acknowledges the King the people She sees Nawi disappearing
out of the crowd

Lays out an offering of food Behind her someone enters
the chamber comes to kneel beside her It is Nanisca They
stay there together in silence

NAWI
An offering For Izogie

NANISCA
She does not want that fruit She
wants this

Nanisca puts a bottle of whiskey on the altar Nawi stares at
the whiskey feeling the loss of her friend and much more

NAWI
In my blood is the blood of a
killer A man who brought great
pain to you

NANISCA
You are an Agojie

It is not your fault What happened
to me You are not the thing that
hurt me

NANISCA (CONTD)

You survived because you are meant
to be here You are Nawi My
daughter But I do not have the
right to claim that

Nanisca smiles relieved And then Nawi breaks free from the
dance Agojie chant Mi-ga-non Mi-ga-non Nawi comes to
Nanisca She leans in whispers in her ear --

NAWI

Nanisca feels Nawi’s gesture of acceptance and forgiveness
