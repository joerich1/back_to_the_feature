NARRATOR
In May 1980 Fidel Castro -- in an
effort to normalize relations with
the Carter Administration -- opened

the harbor at Mariel Cuba with the
apparent intention of letting some

of his people join their relatives

for Cuba In the next few weeks it
became evident that Castro was forcing
the boat owners to carry back with
them not only their relatives but the
dregs of his jail population By the
time the port was closed 125000
‘Marielitos had landed in Florida

An estimated 25000 had criminal
records This is the story of that
minority -- those they call ‘Los
Bandidos

stilleto and in the empty black void we

muscle tissue brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment inflict or receive either one
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes his shoes broken
cardboard his hair unkempt his complexion sallow from

finishes the number he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl about thirteen years old dark tiny fiery
standing together with a dog and Tony early twenties in
shadow the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling Tony stares at it his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony

expression alters to uncertainty

somebody in another phone booth and goes over

Toad completing the body search rips out the stiletto
taped to the small of Tonys back As he mutters something
in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
into the bathroom producing strands of thick rope

Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now

On his wrist is aflashy gold ID bracelet with Alex
written in diamonds and on the other wrist agold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe 30000 His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money

Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadowathin intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties he has the
look of deathin an unsmiling face Heis always in
proximity to his Jefe usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa-- in asort of garotte

position his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him He is acontinual source of tension
underplaying the scenes particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab past four coal-fired stoves each with massive iron
kettles bubbling with coca pasteacross to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge e rey del rey as he
passes as proud of his factory as a vine grower his
vineyard

SOSA
»-Sso this and my other factory I can
can guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the
year Problem is I have no steady
market Some months I cant get rid
of fifty keys other months I have to
do 2 to 300 keys its crazy hunh
Nobody can run a business that way ---

OMAR
I know what you mean MrSosa we got
the same problems up in Miami the
demand varies for us too month to
month

Sosa looks at him like thats obvious and moveson In his
skinny suit with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers Omars not quite in his league with Sosa

Tony awed by the scope of it all follows along stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke

The Shadow stops eyeballs him

Tony eyeballs him back playing a game with him then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose Pause His
expression says I like it He moves on

The Shadow moveswith him

SOSA
(meanwhile)
-Basically what Im looking for is
somebody to share the risks with me
somebody in the States who might
guarantee me something likesay

assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles amused by his
brashness starting to be intrigued by this animal

Interrupted Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly

appears at the door apparently with a message Sosa waves
him in

The black aide The Skull -- is a slim tall imposing man
with academic ‘horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
on a huge and impressive skull He combines the physical
qualities of an animal with an intellectual As he
approaches he glances down the table his eyes falling

briefly on Omar who doesnt connect fhe Skull falters --

just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosawith the
same stony loyal expression

Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information

Then he nods dismissing the Skull who heads out the room
Sosa glances at his gold Rolex

jungle and theres nothing youll

ever see like him I present with
great pride ‘from Caracas Venezuela
-- Octavio

Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter

He is dressed asan enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck
With a red bulb for a nose he gyrates grotesquely to the
sleek song once the mood of laughter has been established
the music suddenly shifts upbeat to Saturday Night Fever
and the clown like a butterfly from a worm starts
shedding the stuffing from his clothes his big eyes
staring out at us in theatrical melancholy

Tony watches sitting alone distracted by the clown

More laughter more clothes coming off building a tempo
When the head mask comes off we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience

Tony is hooked by the image looks on

The clown is down to his leotards thin as a stick and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him
bouncing around like yo-yos Everybody is laughing
everybody is merry

00766 95

except Tony and the clown weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close a haunting figure of mockery

Tony absorbed by his thoughts is lucky this time His
antennae warn him Out of the side of his eye he sees

The two hitters moving on him

He sprawls Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery
smashing the mirrors

Screams crowd diving for cover

Tony hit in the shoulder rolls gets his Baretta out of
his ankle firing

Hits one of the gunmen in the chest the man staggers
across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and
ceilings

Tony moving under the tables towards the door firing

The second hitter is pinned firing back breaking more
mirrors and more screaming

Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door his clothes ripped with blood andglass

The clown Octavio lies dead on the silent dance floor

CUT TO
EXT THE BABYLON CLUB » NIGHT

Tony runs out crouched to his red Jaguar

Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking
lot he runs out of ammunition

He jumps into the Jaguar his windows being blown out

The second hitter wounded running out of the club
towards him

The third hitter advancing carhops scattering

Tony reaching under his seat gets a hold of his own Ingram
machine pistol cocks it and lays down a field of fire

Carhops scattering the hitters seeking cover

Hitter two already wounded is hit again his head
exploding like squashed watermelon

00766 96

Tony now pops a button Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows

He guns the Jaguar out into the lot bullets careening off
the armor plating whining against the shutters

Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse

In an instant his warmobile accelerates in reverse
climbing to top speed

As hitter three realizes its too late tries to get out of
there but is overtaken and crushed by the car

we can solve the drug problem is the

Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
chairs one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene
Seidelbaums a small fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
rings on his fingers and sharp porky eyes

The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban is long lean and
smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes He drinks
coffee smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who

look the part

Its a tedious process counting a million five in twenties
it takes fourfive hours and throughout the desultory
dialogue Tony absorbed by the money and Nick never stop
the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the
amounts At all times all four men thoroughly aware of
the large stacks onthe table move and talk gingerly

although they appear casual and bored They drink a lot of
coffee

LUIS

Gutierrez is a young charismatic man very well dressed and

enormous passion

GUTIERREZ

More than 10000 of our people are
being tortured and held without trial
In the past two years another 6000
have simply disappeared And your

Ive heard whispers Doctor Gutierrez
about the financial support your gove
ment receives from the drug industry

GUTIERREZ
The irony of course is that this
money -- which is in the billions
Jim -- is coming from your country
You are the major purchaser of our
national product -- which of course
is cocaine

So what youre saying Doctor Gutierrez

is the United States Government is
spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs into our
streets and at the same time is

doing business with the very same
government that floods those’ streets
with cocainethats a bit like
robbing Peter to pay Paul isnt it

(passionate)

The United States Government has to
stop supporting these facist gang-

that is what your country has to
do You have to set a strong example
by calling for the observation of

her sex methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic

distance between them She sees him scurrying turns an
expression like a demented angel

Advancing on him firing The furniture tearing up the chair

spilling television sets and computer toys shattering Tony

A young Columbian punk nOmore than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there reacting to the broken window

He doesnt hesitate turning his machine gun on Gina

Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room spine severed and dead before she hits the floor

Tony sees it yells something in the same instant
swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside
The punk is taken by surprise not having seen Tony and
Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
him over the balustrade

The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony

Tony from above grabs up the punks machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the
pool below

Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool spots
Tony yells up ---

ERNIE

Tony theyre everywhere Get outta
here

Ernie suddenly wheels hit in the face by a burst of
silencer bullets

We catch a brief glimpse of Sosas black aide the Skull
moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands

Tony tossing the empty machine gun aside wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns crosses to Gina corpse
It takes him by surprise He comes to a dead stop kneels
looking questioningly in her face

the corpse of Chi-Chi motioning to-each other laying a
grenade at the base of the door to blow it out
Tony loading his rocket ihtends to beat them to the punch
talking to himself
TONY
So you wanna play hunh say hello (X

to my little friend here

Karroooomph

The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian
punks off the landing into the foyer It sounds like

Armageddon one of the hitters screaming smoke billowing
wildly

Tony at the height of his mad glory steps out at the apex
of the stairs firing his machine gun and yelling

02154 166-A
Rev 122182

TONY

Whores Cowards You think you (X)

A hitter tumbles down the left-hand stair

Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair

TONY
Who you think I am I kill all you
fuckin assholes I take you all to
fuckin hell

Left Right

Another hitter drops screaming off the stairs into the
pool below

A grenade goes off Tony is hit again but keeps on firing
away Laughing like a madman
TONY
You need an army you hear An army
to kill me

Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go
up in a burst of wind whipping around the office in auras
of white It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears
the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards

Tonys back with a sawed-off shotgun ‘

TONY
Ha ha ha ha ha You whores you
scum I piss in your faces
ha ha ha ha

The Skull now inches from Tonys back pulls the trigger
and blows Tonys spine out his belly

Tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior
swimming pool below

He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters

As the titles begin their crawl up the music theme is
expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety

The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the
lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters It says

THE WORLD IS YOURS
And so for the brief moment it was

Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool
panning past the dream villa past the shambles and the
wealth past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
that obscene word Chivato in blood on the outside walls
past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like
leaves in autumn with the looters running after it across
the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut
Grove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay
