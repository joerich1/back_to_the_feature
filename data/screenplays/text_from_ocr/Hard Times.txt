ROADHOUSE NIGHT

A pool game in progress

JUKEBOX PLAYING

Pettibon watches the game while talking to a blonde woman
The Man with the revolver is belly up to the bar

With startling impact a spanner wrench comes TEARING
through the front plate glass window

All voices stop all eyes to the front of the bar
Chaney comes through the back door

He hits the Man with the pistol in the kidney flattens
him with the punch

Chaney rolls him over pulls out the revolver

He walks toward Pettibon carrying the pistol loosely
at his side

One of the pool players swings at Chaney with his cue
Chaney twists out of the way as the cue shatters across
the pool table

He puts the pistol in his pocket then hammers the pool
player with three punches dropping him like a lead weight

CHANEY
Anybody else

No takers
Chaney faces the Cajun fighter takes the pistol out again

CHANEY
What about you

The Cajun fighter shakes his head
Chaney has moved near Pettibon

Speed and Poe have opened the front door of the bar they
Stand blocking the entrance

CHANEY
I got the gun this time

PETTIBON
Guess you do But Im not sure
you want to use it

Chaney swings the pistol in a tight circle popping him
on the side of the neck sending Pettibon to the floor

CHANEY

Thats one way Want to see
another

Pettibon hesitates then throws his wallet to Chaney

Chaney removes the money puts it in his pocket tosses
the wallet aside

Chaney looks at the pistol in his hand

He walks slowly over near the entrance Poe and Speed
have moved back outside

CHANEY
This your place Pettibon

49 Chaney turns back to the room
He again looks at the gun then to Pettibon

Chaney suddenly BLASTS out the glasses over the mantle
Everyone in the roadhouse hits the floor

Chaney looks at Pettibon

Chaney BLASTS out the bar mirror
Chaney BLASTS an overhead light
Chaney BLASTS the jukebox
Chaney BLASTS the wall phone
Sudden silence

Chaney sees himself in a portion of the shattered bar
mirror

Chaney BLASTS his own image Then looks at Speed and Poe

Raining blows

Trip-hammer concussion

Street grabs Chaneys left
Slowly pulls him close

Smashing with his own right
Chaney blocking punches

Still caught in the grip
Suddenly all blows cease

They test each others strength
The moment of decision

Chaney twists free

Again they stand facing one another
Street moves with his right
Chaney steps around it

Left to the head

Chaney now the artist

Slides hits slides again
Chaneys blows are coming fast in combinations
A flurry

Street falls back

Not a result of one blow

All of them

He continues to stagger backwards
Moving on his heels

Further backward

Chaney watching

Gandil nudges Jim Henry

Jim Henry throws two palmers out to Street

They clatter on the cement floor

Street looks down at the shining pieces of metal
Gandil takes a step toward his hitter

GANDIL

Kicks the palmers away

Moves back toward the center

Head body body head

Hook cross hook again Straight right

Street falls

Tries to rise

On his feet moves forward
Falls again

Sprawled against a truck wheel
His eyes are vacant

Chaney goes to him

Looks down then turns away
Walks to Speed

Puts on his coat and hat
Nobody else moves

Chaney crosses to Gandil

CHANEY
You owe me money

Gandil hands him the roll
Poe and Speed come up next to Chaney

GANDIL
