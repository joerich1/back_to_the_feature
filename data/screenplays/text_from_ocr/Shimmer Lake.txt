EXT HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

The unassuming house sits right smack in the middle of
some crappy town youve never heard of that sits on the
outskirts of some crappy town you have heard of This is
Winfield Kansas or Rittman Ohio

INT BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM

ANDY SIKES eyes closed lies flat on his back on the
floor of the unfinished room He has a gun in one hand
while the other clutches the shoulder-strap of a large
green duffle bag Andy is middle-aged with a flabby
physique and a balding pate He looks like a CPA except
that hes caked in dried blood

Its unclear if hes alive or dead until he wakes with a
start sucking in a massive breath

CUT TO BLACK

Andys shirt is now off and he is at the sink

duffle bag He turns off the faucet and listens He
hears MUFFLED VOICES directly above him Picking up the
gun he opens the double-doors that lead to the Rec Room

INT BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM

Andy looks to his left and right and sees that hes in
the same room as the cereal He hears the PITTER-PATTER
of LITTLE FEET and turns toward the double-doors which
open to reveal SALLY a fresh-faced three-year-old girl
with pigtails Andy immediately slaps a hand over her
mouth just as shes about to let loose with a scream

ANDY
Hi sweetie Surprised to see me

She nods his hand still covering her now grinning mouth

ANDY (CONTD)
Did you want some Fruit Loops

Sally nods Andys hand moving with her head He hands
her a box and puts a finger to his lips

ANDY (CONTD)

INT SIKES HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Sally walks over and seats herself at a round table
joining MARTHA SIKES a rotund housewife with rapidly
fading 2nd-Place-in-a-beauty-contest looks and ZEKE
SIKES a handsome and physically fit man whos left arm
is in a sling Zeke is not a man who smiles easily and
even when hes cracking a joke its more to make a point
than get a laugh

MARTHA
(handing Sally a new bowl)
Here you go sugarplum

SALLY
Thank you Mommy

ZEKE
Sally who were you talking to in the
basement

SALLY

The PHONE RINGS and Martha leaps for it

MARTHA
Hello
(disappointed)
Oh hi Reed Any word Hang on

She hands the phone to Zeke who has risen from the table
Standing we see hes a police officer with a badge
clipped to his belt as well as a holster and gun
Meanwhile Sally pours herself a bowl of Fruit Loops and
Martha leans against the sink making no bones about
listening to Zekes conversation

ZEKE
Whats happening And hes not
answering his phone Better tell the
Feds to meet us over there

zekes focus shifts from his conversation with Reed to
Sally who is in the process of heading downstairs with a
full bowl of Fruit Loops

MARTHA
Sally Ann where do you think youre
going

Still on the phone Zeke raises a hand to Martha
indicating that hell deal with it

ZEKE
You bet See you in a few

Zeke hangs up the phone and follows Sally downstairs

Staying a few steps behind Sally Zeke follows her as she
crosses the room spilling milk and Fruit Loops all over
the carpet She arrives at the laundry room doors puts
the bowl down and knocks Zekes hand moves
instinctively for his gun Not getting any reply Sally
reaches out and opens both doors revealing an empty
room
EXT STREET - ESTABLISHING —- MORNING

A thoroughly beat-up Chevy Lumina drives down the road

INT CHEVY LUMINA - MORNING

Andy is at the wheel Hes now wearing a grey size-
fatso track suit that fits him perfectly On the back
seat sits the big green duffle bag

INT SIKES HOUSE - BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

With Sally nowhere in sight Zeke pokes around the
laundry room His nostrils flare a few times as he tries
to pick up a scent of something Then his eyes go toa
towel draped over the edge of the sink and the suds
ringing the drain Feeling the damp towel he curses
under his breath then races upstairs

EXT SIKES HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MORNING

Zeke exits the front door and stands at the edge of the
porch scanning the neighborhood His gaze stops on the
next-door neighbor HARRIS whos standing frozen in
place facing his empty driveway holding a cup of coffee
and a newspaper

ZEKE
Morning Harris

HARRIS
(turning to see Zeke)
Ezekiel Its the damnedest thing I
think someone stole my car

ZEKE
You dont say

HARRIS
It sounds crazy I mean who would want an
‘87 Lumina but --

ZEKE
But the cars not here And you are
ipso facto

HARRIS
You dont seem very surprised
ZEKE
Surprise is for the ill-prepared
(beat)
Cmon Ill give you a ride to work

HARRIS
Awful kind of you Ezekiel

Martha emerges in her dressing gown carrying a thermos

MARTHA
Fixed you some coffee Morning Harris

Martha hands Zeke the thermos and scurries back into the
house Zeke gets in the car with Harris and drives off

INT CHEVY LUMINA - MORNING

Andy drives down a back road flanked by acres of cows
grazing on either side of him He flips open a cell
phone and punches in a number

ANDY
I fucking got it It doesnt matter
lets just get the hell out of here
When can you get away Shimmer Lake
Perfect Ill wait for you there

He snaps the phone shut and tosses it on the passenger
seat Then ducks down low as he passes a man riding a
tractor along the side of the road

EXT ETHINGTON HOUSE - LATE MORNING

Zekes police car pulls up to the curb in front of a
small house REED ETHINGTON a man with narrow shoulders
and a tree-trunk ass makes his way from his front steps
to Zekes police car Reed is a nice guy but one look
at him tells you his typical investigation involves
figuring out what stained the belly of his uniform He
meanders around to the passenger door and sees Harris
sitting in his seat Reed bites his lip and shakes his
head Then suddenly pitches a fit stomping his foot and
twisting in a circle while cursing under his breath

When hes done he hops in the back seat pleasant as a
spring morning
INT ZEKES POLICE CAR

REED
Hey there Harris

Reed pulls the door shut and the car pulls off

HARRIS

REED

EXT STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

We follow the police car as it makes its way into town

INT ZEKES POLICE CAR

HARRIS
(to Zeke)
Hows the shoulder
ZEKE
It hurts
HARRIS

Ask a stupid question right

ZEKE
Actually when it happened it didnt
hurt as much as youd think It felt
more like someone gave me a real strong
shove

The car pulls over and stops outside the Post Office
HARRIS
Thanks for the ride

ZEKE
Dont mention it and dont worry about
your car Ill make sure whoever made
off with it gets whats coming to him

HARRIS
Much obliged

Harris starts to get out of the car but Zeke starts
talking again

ZEKE
Without law and order justice and
punishment where are we Out in the
woods clawing each others eyes out over
a bunch of berries thats where

HARRIS
Right well Id just like to get my
car back

ZEKE

Sure Like I said Ill take care of it

Harris steps out of the car and Reed eyes the handleless
back door of the police car with disgust

REED
When I get out of here Im going to kill
you

ZEKE
Then I guess I better not let you out of
there

EXT STREET - THE NEXT MOMENT
Zeke pulls the car away from the curb
REED (0S)

shes trying in vain to cover up
The room is run down full of furniture no one would be
proud of Across the room we see an open closet one
side of which is bare while the other side remains full
of womens clothes

INT ZEKES POLICE CAR - LATE MORNING

Zeke is parked on the street when a tan sedan pulls
alongside with two dishevelled looking men sitting
inside They are KYLE WALKER and KURT BILTMORE two
young clean-cut FBI Agents who by virtue of their being
there clearly havent made it too far up the FBI pecking
order Reed meanwhile remains trapped in Zekes back
seat

KYLE
Whatd he do this time

ZEKE
(deadpan)
I got him for impersonating a police
officer

REED
Hardy har har

The Feds ease their car in front of Zekes and pull over
The two men step out of the car and stretch their legs
zeke gets out of his car and releases Reed from the back
seat without a word of apology

EXT STREET

ZEKE
(to the Feds)
See anything over at the Burtons last
night

KURT
Nothing but phantom naked school boys

KYLE
I swear to God I saw a naked kid come
trotting from one backyard to another
holding a bundle of clothes in one hand
and a crack pipe in the other

KURT
Riiight Other than that nada Nobody
showed up and she never left

(MORE)

the curb The rest follow behind him

KYLE (CONTD)

KURT

EXT HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - SECONDS LATER

The four men arrive at the front door and Zeke RINGS the
BELL No answer He RINGS again Nothing

ZEKE
(to Reed)
You spoke to his wife

REED
She said he was supposed to have arrived
early this morning

KURT
Why do we care that this Dawkins guy has
gone AWOL

ZEKE

The bank that was robbed on Tuesday
Dawkins owns it

KURT
So they robbed the bank then came back
and stole the banker

ZEKE
Maybe the banker was involved in the
robbery

KURT
Why would a guy who owns a bank need
money

ZEKE

Thats an excellent question Did they
teach you that at Quantico

KYLE
(to Kurt)
Dude hes ripping on you

Zeke RINGS again and pounds on the door
ZEKE
Judge Dawkins Its Zeke Sikes Can you

open the door please

Still nothing Zeke takes it upon himself to walk around
to the back of the house trailed by Reed and the Feds

EXT DAWKINS HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
They arrive at the back door and find it wide open Two
sets of bloody footprints lead away from the door in

opposite directions

ZEKE
Better get ‘em out

All four men draw their guns Zeke leans over and takes
a look at the side of Kyles weapon

ZEKE (CONTD)
Just making sure the safetys off

KYLE
Fuck off

The four men step cautiously into the house

INT DAWKINS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Zeke leads the way and we FOLLOW them THROUGH the
kitchen UP the staircase and then LEFT as they follow
the trails of footprints

INT DAWKINS HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

zeke steps into the room and immediately encounters the
body of JUDGE BRAD DAWKINS Dawkins is in his fifties
with a graying coif and a barrel chest Trouble is
theres a rather large hole in the barrel Dawkins wears
nothing but a robe and his body is sprawled awkwardly
across the hardwood floor in a pool of semi-dried blood

The three other law men arrive right behind him

REED
Oh lord

Reed averts his gaze looking like hes about to puke

KYLE
Whoa

Zekes PHONE RINGS and he picks it up

ZEKE
Sikes Martha its really not the
best ti -- I promise Ill let you

He hangs up
ZEKE (CONTD)
(to Reed)
Marthas making meat loaf tonight

REED

KURT

Zeke turns his attention to the two FBI men who are
standing over Dawkins body looking perplexed

ZEKE

KYLE
This ones cock is missing

Zeke looks

KURT
Looks like he Silence of the Lambsd it

KYLE
(beat)
Yesterdays guy has his cock out todays

Zeke opens his mouth to say something smart but realizes
he has no idea what to say Even Reed takes a look The
four of them huddle over Dawkins body racking their
brains for an explanation

EXT CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Stephanie holds a bouquet and stands in front of a small
headstone Three fresh bouquets lean against the stone
The inscription reads Ed Burton Jr Mar 15 2001 -
Jun 16 2005

She lays the flowers next to the others and wipes a tear
from her eye
EXT DAWKINS HOUSE - FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

Zeke Reed Kurt and Kyle stand on the lawn while CRIME
SCENE PEOPLE traipse in and out of the house

KYLE
So you think this is connected to the
robbery

ZEKE
Reed how many murders did we have in
this town last year

REED
Zero

ZEKE
And the year before that

REED
Zero Well one if you count Ed Jr
although that wasnt technically a mur --

ZEKE
Point is its highly unlikely this is
unrelated

REED

Highly unlikely

KURT
So it looks like were back to my
Quantico question

ZEKE
Right Why would the guy who owns the
bank want it knocked off

KYLE
And whats up with the all the penis
shenanigans

EXT SHIMMER LAKE - SHORE —- AFTERNOON

On a deserted patch of dirt in an overgrown ramble of
weeds and shrubs Andy pulls the Chevy Lumina up to the
edge of a small body of water Near the shore is an
ancient looking sign that reads Shimmer Lake Andy
gets out and heads around to the back seat where he
retrieves the huge green duffel bag It appears to weigh
about exactly as much as he can handle lifting He drags
the bag off into the brush then returns to the car and
takes a seat on top of the trunk

INT GUN STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

Steph wearing sunglasses walks in the front door of a
large gun store She proceeds directly to the seedy
PROPRIETOR behind the counter

PROPRIETOR
Hello nurse

STEPH
I called earlier You said you hada
Smith and Wesson Model 27

PROPRIETOR
The lovely lady knows what she wants

STEPH
Do you have it or not

PROPRIETOR
Sure I have it

The man retrieves a black-handled gun from a case at the
far end of the counter Steph looks it over thoroughly
and puts it back on the counter

STEPH
This is a 28

PROPRIETOR
Lady you hit Mr Rapist in the chest
with either a 27 or 28 and trust me he
aint gonna know the difference

Steph shakes her head and turns for the door

STEPH
Im not worried about Mr Rapist Im
worried about Mr Forensics

EXT GUN STORE - PARKING LOT - A MINUTE LATER

The Proprietor exits the store and heads over to Steph
whos in the front seat of her car preparing to pull out
He taps on her window and she rolls it down Shes no
longer wearing her sunglasses and her bruises are
evident

PROPRIETOR
Im assuming this is going to be a cash
transaction

Steph flashes the man a wad of bills

PROPRIETOR (CONTD)
Truth is if ballistics runs a test on
your bullets theyre gonna know if it was
the same gun that fired em whether
theyre both 27s or not But both the 27
and 28 take 357 magnum ammunition and
if they find two sets of smashed up 357s
they aint gonna run no ballistics

Steph thinks about it for a moment and then trades the
cash for the Model 28

PROPRIETOR (CONTD)
This for him who marked your face

Steph nods

PROPRIETOR (CONTD)
Give him hell

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Kurt Kyle Reed and Zeke sit in the main room of the
station A SECRETARY puts the final touches on a flyer
displaying a picture of Ed Burton and Andy Sikes both
men are described as armed and dangerous

ZEKE
I dont know how many times I have to
keep saying this but Eds the man youre
looking for Eds the one whos armed
and dangerous Eds the killer Andys
just a patsy

KURT
Listen Zeke we understand youve got
strong feelings on the matter

ZEKE
Strong feelings That son of a bitch
looked me in the eye and shot me Thats
not feeling its fact

KURT
Cmon now Zeke Were we not humble
Were we not respectful of the local
nature of the crime But things have
changed now This is where Kyle and I
can use the resources of the Bureau to
catch these guys before they vanish into
thin air

(MORE)

KURT (CONTD)
Were widening the net to a ten-state
radius weve got APBs out to every
government agency in the country Weve
got checkpoints all over the map on every
major highway in every direction for 300
miles

ZEKE
What if theyre still here

KURT
Why would they still be here Its all
wrapped up Ed Burton tells his wife
theres one more thing he needs to take
care of and that was Dawkins Thats
that

ZEKE
What about Andy

KURT
Andys with Ed We found two sets of
bloody footprints heading out of Dawkins

house

ZEKE
But the footprints went off in different
directions

KURT

So what Maybe they chopped the money
then and there and went their separate
ways Maybe they left two trails to
confuse us I dont see how it matters

ZEKE
Youll see it matters when we find Andys
body you stupid asshole

Zeke storms off

KYLE
You know your partners being real pig-
headed about this

REED
My partner My partner is the smartest
guy in the room and if you two havent
figured that out by now then youre twice
as dumb as you look

Reed shakes his head at the two FBI men and then follows
after Zeke
KYLE
Twice as dumb as we look How dumb does
that make us

Kurt flips his hands over and uses his thumb and pointer
fingers to form a pair of glasses

KURT
I dont know Pretty dumb I suppose

EXT POLICE STATION - FRONT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

Reed whistles after Zeke from the front steps of the
police station then catches up with him as Zeke starts

his car

Zeke leans out of the open window

ZEKE

REED
Nah Ill catch a ride with Lenny and
Squiggy
(beat)
You alright there partner

ZEKE
Im fine Im just fed up with the whole
thing

REED

ZEKE
Im gonna swing by the Burton place just
to see if Ed thinks twice about leaving
Steph behind Plus maybe if I stay there
long enough I can avoid eating any of
Marthas meatloaf

REED
You want some company

ZEKE
Definitely But Id prefer it if you
kept an eye on the Feds They seem like
decent guys but if Andy does turn up Id
rather hear about it before he gets
gunned down

REED
You really think hes still here

ZEKE
Reed he was at the house last night

REED
You saw him Why didnt you sa --

ZEKE
I didnt see him I just I dont

slows and comes to a halt about twenty yards past her
front door Without getting up Steph flicks off the
lamp

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Reed Kyle and Kurt sit in the main room of the police
station A POLICE SCANNER HUMS at low volume in the
background and a speaker phone sits on the table
directly in front of Kyle

KYLE

REED
I dont think its appropriate for me to
bet on whether our towns first murderers
in ten years get caught or not

KYLE
Of course its not appropriate thats
why its fun I say its 10 to 1 they
get picked up in the next 24 hours

REED

KYLE
Jeez Reed lighten up

The three men sit quietly for a moment listening to the
STATIC pouring out of the RADIO

KYLE (CONTD)

woman and she looks exactly like
Stephanie Burton but shes only three
feet tall

The SPEAKER BURSTS into sound interrupting Kurt
FBI COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER

the handset and puts it to his ear

KURT

suspects are white

EXT SHIMMER LAKE - SHORE - NIGHT

Andy sits on the trunk of the Lumina leaning against the
back window staring at the stars

A pair of headlights approach momentarily blinding him
but then the angle changes slightly and we see its a
beat-up looking white Ford Taurus The car pulls to a
stop and the driver cuts the engine Without the benefit
of the headlights the surroundings are suddenly very
dark but when the drivers side window rolls down we can
make out that its Steph behind the wheel

STEPH
Hey babe

ANDY
Pop the trunk

Andy goes back to the bushes and retrieves the duffel
bag

ANDY (CONTD)
What took you so long

STEPH
Zeke He parked outside the house for
hours I had to wait til he took off

ANDY

He hoists the bag onto a knee and then from there
topples it into the trunk

ANDY (CONTD)
I dont know about you babe but Im
starving

He slams the trunk shut and heads around to the passenger
side and pulls open the door

ANDY (CONTD)
Lets hit a --

Andy stops himself as he sees theres someone in the
passenger seat of the car All we see of the passenger
is their arm and hand which holds a gun a black-handled
Smith and Wesson Model 28 revolver to be precise Andy
sinks to his knees his hands clasped in front of him

ANDY (CONTD)
No please dont --
ARM AND HAND HOLDING GUN
The GUN FIRES Once twice three times With each shot
we MOVE IN TIGHTER on the arm of the shooter and in the

repeated muzzle flash were able to discern a tattoo on
the shooters forearm It reads 95 State Champs

Sally giggles not really understanding and out the
front door of the house ambles Reed who makes his way
around to the passenger seat and finds Sally sitting
inside flicking the lights on and off The tension is
visible in Reeds face and neck as he removes his hat and
scratches his chin He does a shorter less elaborate
version of the dance of despair he did on Friday

REED

INT DAWKINS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE MORNING

Dawkins attention is still focused on the TV which is
now airing footage of a crime-scene

NEWS ANCHOR
Police arent saying much about this
latest killing and what the victim
Chris Morrow was doing at the Carriage
House Inn at the time of his death They
have however identified the two
remaining suspects in the First Mackey
Bank robbery Ed Burton and Andrew Sikes
as the chief suspects in the Morrow
murder

While the news anchor talks Dawkins picks up his phone
punches in a number and puts the phone to his ear

The news sends a chill down your spine
as we can now see in the most graphic way
possible that Tuesdays dramatic shoot-
out at the FMB is anything but over
As for the vict --

Dawkins mutes the set

DAWKINS
Listen hombre youve got to come get
this bag faster than pronto Youve got
to get this bag out of here give me that
tape and then get lost to wherever the
hell youre planning to get lost to and
dont tell me where that is because I
dont want to know Just get over here

Dawkins flips the phone closed and immediately reaches

for another cigarette forgetting the lit one that
dangles from his mouth

INT ZEKES POLICE CAR - EARLY AFTERNOON

Zeke is closing his cell phone Reed is still in the
back seat

REED
Martha

ZEKE

REED

ZEKE
Fat chance Honestly I dont know how
you people do it

REED
You people

The cruiser pulls off the road and into the parking lot
of a seedy motel They pull up to the yellow-taped
perimeter of a full blown crime scene and are
immediately met by Kyle and Kurt They take one look at
Reed in the back seat and start chortling

KURT
Imagine that the bad guy was a cop

KYLE
Thats why they always send in the Feds
You just cant trust the locals

REED
Hardy har har

ZEKE
What do you think fellas should we give
him a fair trial or just shoot him and
dump him in the lake

KURT
Shoot him

KYLE
Definitely

Reed flashes them the finger as Zeke pulls the car into
a spot and gets out releasing Reed a moment later

INT BURTON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY AFTERNOON

Stephanie stands in front of the slightly ajar door
between the kitchen and living room Balancing on the
door above her head is the iron pointy-end facing
towards the door frame Steph takes a deep breath then
looks up as she kicks the door closed The iron is
forced from its perch and collides violently with Stephs
face before tumbling to the floor She howls in pain

EXT MOTEL —- PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Zeke steps under the yellow police tape followed closely
by Reed Kyle and Kurt

ZEKE
Whats the story

KURT
Cleaning lady found him this morning
Looks like our bank bandits had a dispute
over how to split the proceeds

KYLE
Or never planned to split ‘em with this

guy-

zeke heads for the room stopping briefly to exchange
greetings with a few of the LOCAL OFFICERS who were first
on the scene Kurt and Kyle follow behind him as does
Reed looking more than a little overwhelmed

INT MOTEL ROOM

The room is dingy a typical roadside motel that hasnt
been renovated since the 80s There are a couple of
queen-sized beds a table and chairs a TV etc At the
back of the room is a sink in front of a mirrored wall
to the left of which is the door to the toilet and
shower Stopping at the front door Zeke takes a quick
glance at the bolt and latch from inside the room

ZEKE
No sign of forced entry

KURT
Nah Whoever it was knew this guy

They step further into the room and see CHRIS MORROW
lying on the floor in a pool of blood Morrow is in his
early thirties slim and very dead Hes wearing boots
a pair of slacks and a sweatshirt Reed takes one look
at the body and turns around and heads back out the door

KURT (CONTD)
Your partner doesnt seem too comfortable
around bodies

ZEKE
Yeah well we knew the guy
KYLE
You seem alright though

ZEKE
Yeah well I knew the guy

KURT
Meaning

ZEKE
Meaning I cant say Im too surprised
The kid was a little slow Got his brain
fried in a Meth lab explosion a few years
back

KURT
This the same blow-up that landed Ed
Burton in the pen

ZEKE
Thats the one

KURT
So that ties them together But what
about --

ZEKE
My brother

KURT
Yeah You said he knew the other two
well

ZEKE

Like I said everybody knows everybody
well We all went to the same high
school and played on the same football
team Shit a few of us even dated the
same girls

(beat)
But theres something else Andy was the
prosecutor in the case against Ed and
Chris

KURT
Your brother is the fucking prosecutor

ZEKE
He was There was a pretty good scandal
after Eds trial on account of him
getting such a light sentence

(MORE)

ZEKE (CONTD)
Nobody ever proved anything but a rumor
went around that Ed paid Andy to drop the
reckless manslaughter charge

KURT
Who got manslaughtered The file said he
only got rung up on Meth charges

ZEKE
When the lab exploded Eds son was
killed in the blast

KURT
Jesus

ZEKE
Anyway come the next election my
brother got less than 10 of the vote

KURT

You think your brother took the money
ZEKE

I --
KYLE

(leaning over the body)
What the focaccia Is that what I think
it is
The three men huddle over Burtons corpse

ZEKE
Sure looks like it

KURT
What the hell is that about

Reed steps into the room and stands facing the far wall
his eyes as far away from Chris body as possible

REED
I just got a call from Steph Burton

KURT
Ed Burtons wife

REED
She says Ed just came and went

ZEKE
Shit

Everyone but Kyle immediately heads for the door

KYLE
Really Nobody else is curious why this
guys got his cock out

INT BURTON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Zeke and Reed sit on a cheap couch opposite Steph The
two FBI men nose around the dilapidated house listening
to the conversation but allowing Zeke to take the lead
There is a huge welt forming below Stephs right eye to
which shes applying an ice pack

ZEKE
He didnt say where he was heading
STEPH
No
ZEKE
He just came back here to get his
clothes
STEPH
He wanted me to go with him
ZEKE
And you said no
STEPH
I said no
ZEKE

(beat)
You expect us to believe that Ed showed
up here with three million dollars in
cash and you told him to get lost

STEPH
Have you seen my face I called you
remember

Zeke shrugs as if to say fair point

ZEKE
Steph listen I know youre cooperating
with us here I just need to make
something clear If theres anything
youre not telling us anything at all
you can wind up getting dragged into all
this as an accessory after the fact

(MORE)

ZEKE (CONTD)
And because you got both state and
federal officers involved it means
everything gets multiplied by two

STEPH
I dont understand

ZEKE
You see youve got state crimes and
youve got federal crimes Instead of
one count accessory after the fact you
get two Instead of one count
obstruction of justice you get two

STEPH
But I didnt do anything

ZEKE
I know it doesnt seem fair but thats
how it goes Weve got a dead body ina
county that doesnt get dead bodies
Weve got a cop with a bullet lodged in
his shoulder This is a big deal If it
turns out youre lying or even if it
turns out you were simply hiding
something no matter what Reed or I think
is just youre gonna end up doing time

STEPH
How much time

KYLE
(sensing the moment is right
for some bad cop)
Long enough so you come out a different
person maybe lose some of those girlish
good looks Maybe come out an old lady
Maybe not come out at all

STEPH
(to Zeke)
Is he for real

Zeke shoots Kyle a withering look

ZEKE
Steph listen --

STEPH
No you listen hell kill me

ZEKE
Nobodys killing anybody
STEPH
Tell that to Chris Morrow

ZEKE
Let me rephrase that The best way for
nobody else to get killed is for you to
tell us everything you know

STEPH
Youre not gonna leave me out here by
myself again are you

ZEKE
No That was my fault and I apologize
It wont happen again

STEPH
(long beat and a deep breath)
Hes going to Mexico Hes got a friend
down in Zihuatanejo who said hed put him
up
ZEKE
Youre sure about this

STEPH
Positive Hes leaving tomorrow

ZEKE
Why tomorrow

STEPH
He said he had one more thing to take
care of but dont ask me what because I
dont know Ed isnt much into
discussing business with me

EXT BURTON HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - AFTERNOON

The four men are gathered on the front lawn

KURT

KURT

ZEKE (CONTD)

REED

Ed still havent split town

REED

The two men turn and head for the patrol car
REED (CONTD)

Stephanie emerges from the house wearing a large pair of
sunglasses that somewhat obscures her swollen face

REED
Something we can do for you Steph

STEPH
Would it be too much trouble for you boys
to accompany me to the cemetery Id
like to bring Ed Jr some fresh flowers

ZEKE
No trouble at all

REED

attention to Reed who looks less than thrilled about
returning to the backseat

INT ZEKES POLICE CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

STEPH
Thanks for the lift

ZEKE
(unbuckling his seat belt)

REED
What about --

ZEKE
I said it could wait

Zeke lets himself out of the car and walks around the
hood to where Steph is waiting for him Reed slides over
to that side of the car expecting to be released then
watches helplessly as Zeke offers Steph his elbow and
escorts her to her sons unseen grave

INT DAWKINS HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING

Dawkins sits on his plush four-poster bed He holds the
phone in his hand but looks unsure what to do with it
He puts it back on the cradle and then immediately
retrieves it and dials a number

INT SIKES HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

zeke sits at the kitchen table along with Sally as they
await the serving of Marthas home fried chicken She
plunks a few pieces of deep-fried bird onto Zekes plate
and he offers up a mangled attempt at enthusiasm

He gets to work cutting through the tough meat and after
finally breaking through the tendon or cartilage or
something similarly horrible he makes a show of popping a
piece into his mouth

ZEKE
Its very good

MARTHA
Well thank you Ezekiel Thats awful
kind of you to say Isnt that nice of
him to say Sally

When she turns to Sally Zeke disgustedly spits the food
from his mouth into the sling holding his wounded arm in
place Sally laughs

MARTHA (CONTD)
Whats so funny little miss giggles

Zeke tips his plate and shovels another fork-load into
his sling Sally giggles some more

MARTHA (CONTD)
I tell you sometimes I just dont know
what to do with this one

SALLY
Are you going to be my new daddy

This comment nearly makes Martha spit up her food but
Zeke isnt the slightest bit rattled

ZEKE
Listen here Sally your daddy is going
to be home safe and sound before you know
it dont you worry

SALLY
If you say so

ZEKE
I do say so Now eat your chicken so you
can grow up to be big and strong like

uncle Zeke okay

SALLY

MARTHA

A long beat Zeke looks downright wistful

ZEKE
As a matter of fact I had a child --

As Zeke is answering Sally takes a fistful of chicken
and throws it down her shirt

MARTHA
Sally Ann Sikes what in Gods name do

While Martha yells at Sally Zeke dumps more food into
his sling which sets Sally off laughing and throwing
more food down her own shirt

MARTHA (CONTD)
On second thought consider yourself
lucky

EXT DAWKINS HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Andy comes up through the back hedges of the neighbor
directly behind Dawkins sprawling grounds He stays
close to the bushes along the side of the house before
darting over to the back door Once there he raises the
butt of a handgun to smash one of the panes of the door
then hesitates He tries the knob and it opens

(under his breath)
Unbelievable

He lets himself in and shuts the door quietly behind him

and sees Naked Boy shitting his brains out

Dawkins clobbers Andy over the head with a lamp and then
leaps on top of him While Naked Boy looks on from the
thrown the two men roll around struggling until a
MUFFLED SHOT goes off between the two men Andy gets to
his feet and Dawkins lies mortally wounded on the floor

back and grabs the remaining Meth off of Dawkins serving
tray

Naked Boy flutters out the door and Andy hoists the bag
over his shoulder Hes momentarily taken aback by its
weight and then heads out of the bedroom

started from and kills the engine He turns his
attention to Andy

INT ZEKES HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

zeke sits at a small round table in a Spartan kitchen
There are no photos on the fridge no pictures on the
walls Nothing to indicate this is the place he calls
home Through the doorway to the living room we see a
treadmill a set of weights and a bench Beside the
exercise equipment are a few piles of books

zeke is reading the local paper the front page of which
reads Three Men Rob First Mackey Bank Sheriff Wounded
in Gun Battle

ZEKE
(with a snort)
Gun battle

While he reads the paper Zeke meticulously cleans a pair
of disassembled police-issue Glock 22 pistols He scrubs
one of the barrels with cleaning fluid and a toothbrush
and winces at a sharp report of pain in his shoulder He
gets up and walks over to the kitchen counter where he
retrieves a needle and a bottle

Zeke draws the liquid into the needle and injects it into
his arm The bottle reads Lidocaine

Zeke removes the needle and flexes his shoulder this
time without much of a reaction
EXT ETHINGTON HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -—- MORNING

Reed stands on his front porch scanning the streets and
checking his watch

He sees the Sheriffs patrol car approaching and puts his
arms up as if to say Where ya been Reed lumbers down
the steps and approaches the passenger door only to find
it occupied by Steph Burton Reed smiles rolls his eyes
and shakes his head ever so slightly Out of both
Stephs sight he shoots Zeke the finger and then hops in
back

ZEKE
Sorry Im late I saw Steph on her way
to the cemetery and figured I might as
well offer her a lift rather than go sit
in front of an empty house

REED
No worries Morning Steph How you
holding up

STEPH
Like the idiot wife of an ex-con who just
shot a cop and split town
(as insincerely as possible)
Howre you doin

REED
(mimicking her insincerity)
Im doin fine thanks for askin

INT BURTON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE MORNING

Steph sits on a couch talking to Reed Zeke stands in
the hallway staring out the front windows of the house

STEPH
All he said was he was gonna be home

REED
And you didnt ask why

STEPH
Sure I asked Lot of good that did

REED
Had you noticed him acting different
lately

STEPH

Different how Like did I see him with a
bunch of his scum bag friends sitting
around the kitchen table going over the
blueprints of the local bank talking
about how they were gonna rob it

REED
Yeah like that

STEPH
No

Zeke sees a tan sedan pull up slowly in front of the
house

ZEKE
Be back in a sec

EXT BURTON HOUSE - FRONT PORCH

Zeke watches from the porch as Kyle and Kurt step out of
the sedan straighten their pants realign their
sunglasses

ZEKE

KURT
By all means

KYLE
Have at it

ZEKE
Fellas this heres a local matter Its
a local crime committed by locals
against locals Shit as Im sure you
already know one of the guys involved is
my goddamn brother In high school we
all played on the same football team We
all know each other So I assure you
nobody is going to be better equipped to
catch these guys then my partner Reed and
I And nobody is going to be better
equipped to catch these guys without
further bloodshed than Reed and I

As if to emphasize his local copness Zeke turns his head
and spits a loogie in the dirt

That said this is a local matter
Nobody here is gunning for headlines or
promotions or anything like that When
it comes time to make arrests you guys
can feel free to take every ounce of
credit Hell Id prefer it Trust me
I dont want to have anything to do with
arresting my own brother So if you guys
are willing to take a bit of a back seat
on this investigation Reed and Ill
gladly paint you the heroes

(beat)
Hows that sound

KURT
Our turn

ZEKE
You bet

KURT

(to Kyle)

way okay

(MORE)
KURT (CONTD)

(beat)
Now I know what happened last night is a
very big deal around these parts but as
far as the Bureaus concerned this aint
exactly 911 Part-two Thats why they
sent the new guys If it wasnt for the
fact that the bank was federally insured
theres no way in hell wed be down here
messing around in your affairs

(beat)
So if you were expecting a couple of
grizzled FBI bad-asses to come charging
in here and giving you the high hat
well I suppose youre gonna be happily
mistaken And if I may be so bold as to
speak for my partner who Ive only
gotten to know on the drive down from HQ
I think your arrangement sounds just
about perfect

KYLE
Amen

ZEKE
Well then Sounds like we all ought to
get along just fine

Reed comes out the front door and makes his way over

ZEKE (CONTD)
Reed Ethington Id like you to meet the
two gentlemen our government has sent

need Kyle Walker and Kurt Biltmore

Reed shakes the two mens hands

REED

thinks hes bigger than right and
wrong Well then God help him

(beat)
(MORE)

ZEKE (CONTD)
Alright Lets see what we can dig up at
Chris place

Zeke pulls the car up to the most dishevelled trailer in
the park It lacks even the amenities that are standard
on the other low-rent trailers and it looks like one
strong breeze would be enough to knock down the walls
Parked next to the trailer is a shiny red Porsche The
Feds park right behind Zekes cruiser and step out

KYLE
(whistling at the Porsche)
Whats a nice girl like you doing ina
place like this

ZEKE
Thats my brothers car

KYLE
Your brother the bank robber drives a
Porsche

ZEKE
That would be a good example of where the
local knowledge I was just talking about
might come in handy

REED
Ill say

KURT
Care to elaborate

ZEKE
Its complicated First lets see what
we find inside Morrows place

KYLE
Mice I suspect A raccoon or two
Maybe a sheep

Zeke steps up the two stairs to the front door of the
trailer and gives it a healthy rap with his fist

ZEKE
You in there Chris

Theres no response Zeke gives the door a couple more
raps then gingerly twists the doorknob and swings the
door open One by one they all step inside

CHRIS (PRE-LAP)

INT BARN - AFTERNOON

Chris sits Indian-style in the corner of the barn In
front of Chris legs sits an elaborate menagerie of farm
animals constructed from hay and straw Chris is
currently manipulating one of the animals in the
direction of another animal

CHRIS

Chris barnyard dispute is interrupted by the ASCENDING
JINGLE of a cheap CELL PHONE It takes him a few RINGS
to realize its coming from his pocket He retrieves the
phone and stares at it for another two RINGS unsure what
to do then opens the phone and puts it to his ear

EXT MOTEL - PARKING LOT - NINE OCLOCK

A truck pulls into the parking lot and Chris jumps out
He steps over to the open passenger window

CHRIS
Gracias amigo

The truck pulls away and Chris heads for the motel He
stops when realizes he doesnt know the room number

We hear a WHISTLE and Chris puts his hand over his eyes
as if to shield them from the sun

STEPH
(sotto voce)
Chris

CHRIS
Yeah

STEPH
Over here

CHRIS

Who is it Steph Is that you

STEPH
Shut up and get over here

Chris nervously approaches the sound of Stephs voice
When he finally sees her he breaks into a relieved grin

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Steph ushers Chris into the room and releases the door
which butts up against the security bar leaving it
slightly ajar On one of the beds is an open suitcase
full of mens clothes a newspaper and the green duffel
bag bulging at the seams

CHRIS
Whats with the door

STEPH
Ed stepped out to get some food and
didnt take the key in case he got
nabbed He didnt want to lead them
right to us

CHRIS
That was smart

STEPH
Eds a smart guy

Steph gives Chris a hug and a kiss

STEPH (CONTD)
Im so glad youre okay

CHRIS
You are

STEPH
Sure I am I was worried about you

CHRIS
I thought maybe you hated me on account
of what happened to Ed Jr

STEPH
It was an accident right

CHRIS
Yes A really terrible accident
(noticing the duffel bag)
Is that what I think it is

STEPH
You bet your ass

He unzips the bag and pulls out two bricks of hundred
dollar bills

CHRIS
How much -- How much is it

STEPH
A little over three million

Now its Chris turn to hug Steph He squeezes her and
lifts her off her feet

STEPH (CONTD)
Not so tight huh

CHRIS
Sorry Im just excited Do you think --
Do you think I could buy a new trailer
with my share

STEPH
I think you could buy three

Chris moves to pick Steph up again but she pushes him
away

STEPH (CONTD)
Chris hon have you changed your clothes
since the robbery

CHRIS
No Why do I smell

She shows him the newspaper the cover of which is
dominated by stories about the crime

STEPH
You might want to skip to the part about
what the suspects were last seen wearing

CHRIS
Oh

STEPH
How did you get here

CHRIS
I hitched a ride

STEPH
Jesus Chris

CHRIS
No its okay they were Spics

STEPH
Spics dont read newspapers

CHRIS
Theyre Spics They cant read English

STEPH
I apologize I hadnt thought it all the
way through Here put on something of
Eds

She grabs him a shirt and a pair of pants from the open
suitcase and Chris takes off his jeans jacket Theres
a gun tucked into his waistband He moves to throw it on
the bed and then thinks better of it

STEPH (CONTD)
Its okay Chris youre with friends

He shrugs and tosses the gun then changes into a pair of
Eds pants and a sweatshirt

STEPH (CONTD)
Wheres Andy

CHRIS
I dont know He went to talk to his
brother I told him that was a stupid
thing to do Zeke being a cop and
everything

STEPH
(beat)
Listen do you mind if I hop in the
shower

CHRIS
You want to take a shower

STEPH
Yes

CHRIS
Um okay

Steph smiles and promptly pulls off her top Chris
nearly shits himself then whips his head around to face
the other way She steps into the bathroom and turns on
the shower then walks over to where Chris is standing

STEPH
Its okay Chris

She unbuttons her jeans and putting a hand on Chris
shoulder wriggles out of them Chris turns his head
slightly and looks at her Steph steps backward toward
the bathroom unclasps her bra and lets it fall to the
floor By this point Chris is downright glacial hes so
focused on her body She slips out of her panties
sticks a hand under the water and then steps into the
shower neglecting to close either the bathroom door or
the shower curtain

CHRIS
When um When did you say Ed was
coming back

STEPH
(soaping her naked body)
At least half an hour You literally
just missed him

Chris knees buckle slightly as the blood abandons his
damaged brain His hand moves to his crotch Steph
smiles and he unzips his fly and pulls out his dick

Steph plays into Chris fantasy her hands moving
sensually over her body As Chris excitement level
gradually increases we see a figure appear in the large
mirror behind the sinks Its Dawkins

We watch as Dawkins switches from confusion to fear
Spotting Chris gun on the bedspread he slowly moves
toward the weapon Just as he gets the gun in his hand
Chris sees him

DAWKINS
Now dont do anything stupid son

CHRIS
You calling me stupid

DAWKINS
What No Im -—-

CHRIS
Cause I aint stupid

DAWKINS
Relax I was only --

CHRIS
Im not stupid man Im not

Chris slowly walks towards Dawkins Its unclear what
his intentions are

CHRIS (CONTD)
You people are always calling me names
but you dont know me

Dawkins backs away the gun pointed right at Chris

DAWKINS
Please stay back Dont make me do
this

CHRIS

You dont know me I was smart once
Chris has Dawkins cornered behind one of the beds

DAWKINS
Please Im begging you dont do this

Chris reaches for the gun and actually gets hold of the
side of it before Dawkins finally pulls the trigger
Theres a BLAST and a hole appears in Chris chest but
he continues to reach for the GUN Dawkins pulls the
trigger TWICE more and Chris collapses at his feet

Steph turns off the shower and steps into the main room
where she quickly begins towelling herself off Her
naked body has no effect on Dawkins whos gone pale as a
ghost

DAWKINS (CONTD)
My god what have I done

STEPH
Boy oh boy you sure picked the wrong guy
to ask not to do anything stupid

DAWKINS
What have I done

STEPH
You killed him Judge
DAWKINS
What was he doing here

STEPH
Your guess is as good as mine He must
have followed me

DAWKINS
Wheres Ed Where the fuck is Ed

Steph hurriedly gets back into her clothes

STEPH
Ed went underground He cant risk being
seen

DAWKINS
Oh God help me

STEPH
Look save your moral quandaries for
later Even in flea bags like this you
cant just shoot people without
attracting some attention

DAWKINS
What about the tape

STEPH
Well give it to you when we come pick up
the bag

DAWKINS
What do you mean pick up the bag

STEPH
We need you to hold onto the money for a
day or two until things cool off a bit

DAWKINS
No no no no no Just give me the
tape Just give me the tape and leave me
out of this

STEPH
Its just a day or two and then this
will all be over

DAWKINS
No This has gone too far

STEPH
Maybe Judge but unless you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison I
suggest you grab the bag and get the hell
out of here

DAWKINS
(pointing the gun at Steph)
Fuck you
STEPH

And make sure your wife and kids arent
around for a few days We want to keep
this thing nice and simple right

DAWKINS
(dropping the gun to his hip)
Fuck you
STEPH
Now go

Steph snaps the suitcase closed and walks out the door
Dawkins finally snaps into self-preservation mode He
makes a failed attempt at picking up the bag braces
himself and then manages to hoist the it off the bed
At the door he flings back the security bar flicks off
the light and exits The DOOR swings SHUT behind him

EXT RUDYS JUNKYARD - ELEVEN OCLOCK

Zeke offers Ed a tip of his cap and Ed turns and heads
into the plant Reed then instinctively tugs on the
inoperable door handle in the back of the cruiser

REED

Zeke ignores Reed and puts the car in gear

REED (CONTD)

EXT MEAT PROCESSING PLANT
The cruiser pulls away from the curb and down the street

Ed comes out of a locker room dressed in what looks like
a plastic hospital gown shower-cap and gloves As he
heads down the hall towards the slaughterhouse floor hes
stopped by a SUPERVISOR with a clipboard

SUPERVISOR
Hey Burton Got a message for you

The supervisor sticks a post-it note on the chest of Eds
plastic gown Rather than punch the middle-manager in
the face Ed simply smiles

EDWARD
(glancing at the note)
Loan me a quarter eh boss

The supervisor retrieves one from his pocket

EDWARD (CONTD)
How about a pen

Reluctantly the supervisor hands over the Bic pen stuck
into the top of the clipboard

SUPERVISOR
Dont think Im not taking this out of
your next pay-stub

Ed ignores him walks over to a nearby pay-phone and
dials

himself a cup of coffee from a cheap Mr Coffee machine

INT BURTON HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

Steph does the dishes while Ed Andy and Chris sit around
the kitchen table going over the blueprints of the local

bank

Chris pours himself a shot of bourbon froma

bottle on the table drawing a nasty look from Andy

CHRIS
What One shot isnt gonna kill anybody

ANDY
Chris we need every brain cell you have
left tonight okay

CHRIS

EDWARD
Chris everythings gonna be fine Isnt

ANDY
Sure Five minutes were in were out
You dont even have to get out of your
car

CHRIS
Yeah why are we taking my car anyway
EDWARD
Because everyone knows I drive a bitchin
Camaro and Andy drives a faggy Porsche
Nobody has the slightest clue what you
drive

ANDY
They probably dont even think you know
how to drive

CHRIS
Of course I know how to fucking drive
thats why Im the driver

EDWARD
And Andys the lookout and Im the safe
cracker Look if we all just stick to
our jobs everything will go perfectly
smooth

ANDY
Hes right Chris theres nothing to
worry about My brother doesnt even
lock the door He figures the fact that
everybody knows hes therell keep any
would-be robbers away And I know
exactly how to kill the camera because
hes shown me about ten times
Seriously he could be the worst cop in
the history of the police force

CHRIS
You shouldnt say that about your own
brother

STEPH
(to Ed)
Can I have a word with you for a second

Ed nods and while Andy continues his conversation with
Chris he follows Steph into the living room

ANDY
Im not saying I dont love the guy but
cmon Hes a total loser The guys
like the best looking dude in town and
hasnt gotten laid

INT BURTON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Steph leads Ed over to the front windows of the house

EDWARD
Whats up

STEPH
I just wanted to apologize for what I
said this morning

EDWARD
Oh yeah Thats a new one

STEPH
Listen Ive been thinking about what you
said about how you thought youd left
this life behind Did you mean that

EDWARD
Of course I meant it

STEPH
Ed Im serious If you really meant it
then I want you to call this whole thing
off

Ed stops and looks at his wife seriously It seems like
its been a long time since hes looked at her this
closely Theres a long quiet moment as Ed looks at
her and seems to truly be contemplating what shes
saying But the moment is too quiet and Ed turns his
head and notices that both Andy and Chris are staring in
at them from the kitchen Seeing them snaps him out of
whatever that moment was and back into his captain-of-
the-football-team persona

EDWARD
Dont go soft on me now girl In
exactly four hours youre going to be a
very rich woman

He gently slaps both hands around her face and plants a
kiss on her lips then drops her and heads back towards
the kitchen

EDWARD (CONTD)
Where were we boys

Steph stares icily out the front window while Ed retakes
his seat at the kitchen table

ANDY
We were telling Chris what a piece of
cake this was gonna be

EDWARD
Right right Chris by the time you
figure out that were robbing the bank
the bank will already by robbed

CHRIS
How do you mean

EXT FIRST MACKEY BANK - PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

Zeke pulls the cruiser into the lot and parks it out
front He steps out of the car with a wrinkled brown
paper bag and makes his way to the front door

INT FIRST MACKEY BANK - FRONT ROOM - SECONDS LATER

The front of the bank is deserted and Zeke makes his way
past the teller windows and into the back room

INT FIRST MACKEY BANK - BACK ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Zeke arrives in the back room where there are a few
desks and a large old vault with its door wide open A
pair of ARMORED CAR MEN stack bundles of bills on the
shelves of the vault while Judge Dawkins looks on
intently

ZEKE
Evening fellas

ARMORED CAR MAN 1
Evening officer

DAWKINS
(seeming slightly drunk)
Sheriff Sikes my good man I cant tell
you how grateful I am that youre going
to all this trouble for us once again

ZEKE
Really its no trouble at all

DAWKINS
Same procedure as usual The cash will
spend the night here then first thing
tomorrow morning well divvy it up
between the other branches to be paid out
when the farmers come to cash their
checks in the next few days

ZEKE
Reedll be handling tomorrows escorts
Im just here to mind the vault

The Armored Car Men finish unloading the money and hand
Dawkins a clipboard and pen

ARMORED CAR MAN 2
If you could just give me your John
Hancock here

Dawkins signs the top sheet

ARMORED CAR MAN 2

And once more here

He signs again

And thats all for us

ARMORED CAR MAN 1
Sheriff Mr Dawkins

DAWKINS
(holding open the back door
to the bank)
Gentlemen

The Armored Car Men leave through the door and Dawkins
locks it behind them He then struts confidently over to
the massive vault door and pulls it shut He spins the
dials on the LOCK and slowly turns the three-armed handle
until it locks into position with an impressive THUNK

DAWKINS (CONTD)
Now if theres nothing else Ill be
heading home Wendy pitches an absolute
fit if Im not home the moment dinners
ready

ZEKE
Better run along then

Dawkins heads for the door but then stops

DAWKINS
Sheriff just as a matter of curiosity
what happens if somebody were to try to
rob the bank tonight

ZEKE
What happens

DAWKINS
You would shoot them right

ZEKE
That sort of depends on the situation
Ideally Id be able to arrest them
without resorting to violence

DAWKINS
Well shoot first and ask questions later
I say No sense putting yourself in
danger just to save the life of a bank
robber Know what I mean

ZEKE
Not really no

DAWKINS
Just know that if anything like that ever
happened Id have your back 100 no
matter what the circumstances

ZEKE
Thats awful nice of you to say Judge
but hopefully itll be just your typical
quiet night at the bank

DAWKINS
of course of course Well good night
then

ZEKE

Night Sheriff

Dawkins walks briskly to the front of the bank leaving
Zeke alone in the back room He tosses the BROWN BAG
onto one of the desks where it lands with a metallic
THUD and then sits down and puts his feet up The clock
on the wall reads 605

tucked beneath her holding a picture of Ed Jr With one
dreamy finger shes tracing the outline of his face The
clock on the wall reads 900

INT FIRST MACKEY BANK - BACK ROOM - EVENING

zeke sits in Dawkins chair reading Different Seasons by
Stephen King and eating a salad out of a plastic
container

We hear a NOISE from the front of the bank and Zeke puts
his fork down He tilts his head like a dog but hears
nothing Just as he picks up his fork once more Ed
wearing a ski-mask enters the back room with a rolled up
green duffel bag in one hand and white-handled gun in the
other He points the gun at Zekes face

EDWARD
(disguising his voice with a
Schwarzenegger accent)
You move one mossle and Ill blow yaw
focking brain all ova da wall

Zeke stays perfectly still but for the fact that he
continues to CRUNCH the FOOD in his mouth Ed walks
slowly over to Zeke and carefully removes the sheriffs
gun from his holster one of the Glock 22s we saw him
cleaning earlier and tucks it into the waistband of his
pants He then turns back and waves out to the front of
the bank

Andy enters also wearing a mask and armed with only a
crow bar While Ed keeps his gun trained on Zeke Andy
heads for a locked cabinet that he pries open with the
bar He glances up towards the security camera above his
head

SECURITY CAMERAS POV

Ed points his gun at Zeke while Andy sets to clumsily
destroying a bank of electronic components After a few
moments the screen goes blank

BACK TO SCENE

Andy calmly exits the room while Ed begins unfolding the
duffel bag He lays the bag down at his feet and
retrieves a folded up post-it-note from his pocket

ZEKE
Lemme guess ‘Step 2 Unlock Vault

(as Schwarzenegger)
You be quiet awe I shoot you in da face

ZEKE
In da face

Ed ignores him and turns the first dial three times to
the right

Zeke reaches into his bag and pulls out a banana and a

cup of yogurt

EDWARD

Ed tears back to the vault and frantically spins the
dials as Zeke reaches into his bag and retrieves a can
of Fresca A few seconds later we hear a familiar THUNK
as the LOCK of the vault pops open

EXT FIRST MACKEY BANK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Chris and Andy havent changed positions since last time
we saw them

CHRIS

I know you didnt want me involved in

lonely out there in that trailer
INT FIRST MACKEY BANK - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

Ed is about halfway through stuffing the money into the
duffel bag and hes chatting with Zeke whos polished
off the yogurt and is getting started on his banana

EDWARD

But thats what Im saying Each
decision we make cuts off about a
thousand alternate choices you might have
made Millions probably if you string
it out far enough Point is Im sorry
that the lousy decisions Ive made have
kept us from remaining friends I miss
the old Ed and Zeke show You and I had
some pretty good times back in the day

ZEKE
Absolutely

EDWARD
And now because of tonight Ill probably
never see you again

ZEKE
I guess that means youre not planning to
shoot me

EDWARD

Shoot you Jesus Z you really think
Im capable of a thing like that

ZEKE
I dont know you killed Ed Jr pretty
good

now a very full duffel bag Zeke remains seated by the
desk digging around in his bag for more food

EDWARD
Do you want me to shoot you Is that it

ZEKE
Other way around

EDWARD
What do you --
Theres a MUFFLED POP as a BULLET whizzes through the
bottom of Zekes brown food bag and into Eds stomach
Ed drops his gun and stumbles backward onto his butt
Zeke removes his hand from the bag holding the other
Glock 22

EDWARD (CONTD)
You shot me

ZEKE
Yes

Zeke retrieves both guns from the stricken Ed whos
kicking his legs and moaning on account of the pain

EDWARD
What the hells going on

ZEKE
Whats going on Youre robbing the
bank Pretty soon youre going to shoot
me and race out the back door with the
money

EDWARD
What are you talking about

ZEKE
Youll kill Chris first Or maybe
Dawkins But probably Chris then
Dawkins And after those two are dead
youll kill Andy

EDWARD
Sure I will

ZEKE
Then after youve tied up all the loose
ends youll disappear with the money
never to be seen or heard from again

EDWARD
That part sounds good

ZEKE
But of course youre not going to do any
such thing because Im gonna kill you
and bury you in a hole out by Shimmer
Lake

EDWARD
Why are you doing this
Zeke turns around and proceeds to the back door of the
bank He unlocks the door and in walks Steph

husband because I thought I owed you
that and because I hoped maybe Ed Jr
could have saved you could have saved
us Then you fucking killed him

EDWARD
It was an accident

STEPH
Fuck you and your accident

Zeke raises his gun and points it at Eds chest

EDWARD (CONTD)

Zeke pulls the trigger -- BANG -- burying a bullet right
between Eds eyes
EXT FIRST MACKEY BANK - PARKING LOT - THE NEXT MOMENT

Chris is out of the car and Andy is still by the door of
the bank

CHRIS

That one was definitely a gun
ANDY

I dont know
CHRIS

That didnt sound like a gunshot

ANDY
I said I didnt know

Chris moves toward the front steps of the bank

CHRIS
Im going in there

ANDY
The fuck you are
CHRIS

ANDY
Chris youre the fucking driver okay
Stay behind the wheel For all we know
that was just him blowing the safe

Blowing it with what

ANDY
I dont fucking know okay
(beat)
How longs it been

CHRIS
Fifteen minutes

ANDY
Fifteen minutes Thats a long time

CHRIS
Thats what Im saying

But that means nobody tripped any alarms

(beat)
I think were fine He was probably just
firing a warning shot or something

INT FIRST MACKEY BANK - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

Steph stands over Eds dead body Zeke walks over and
retrieves Eds white-handled gun from the top of the
desk

STEPH
This is really happening isnt it

ZEKE
(handing her the gun)
Listen babe we dont really have time
for contemplation Just follow the plan
and a few years from now we can sort it
all out on the couch of some shrink

STEPH
Okay
Zeke nods at her then unbuttons his shirt and eases his
right arm out of the sleeve On his forearm we see a
tattoo that reads 95 State Champs He reaches into his
pocket and pulls out a needle and the vial of lidocaine

STEPH (CONTD)
You thought of everything huh

ZEKE
Everything

Zeke rolls up his undershirt to expose his bare shoulder
then injects himself with the painkiller He quickly
begins rubbing his shoulder to get the blood flowing

STEPH
You ready

He punches himself in the shoulder a few times and nods

ZEKE
Ready

Steph raises the weapon and points it at Zekes shoulder
from about two feet away

ZEKE (CONTD)
Back up a little

STEPH
I dont want to miss

ZEKE
You wont miss Just breath easy aim
the gun and pull the trigger

She backs up another few feet

ZEKE (CONTD)
Good Do it

The GUN FIRES and Zeke whips around and topples over one
of the desk chairs Steph shrieks but a moment later
Zeke is on his feet

STEPH
Are you alright

Hes a little unsteady on his feet and blood begins to
slowly ooze from the wound in his shoulder He takes the
gun from Steph and tucks it into his pants

ZEKE
Hows it look

STEPH
It looks like a hole

ZEKE
I mean how much is it bleeding

STEPH
Less than youd expect Its just like
a hole

ZEKE

That means you didnt hit an artery

STEPH
Does it hurt

Zeke flexes the hand of the wounded arm and blinks his
eyes a few times

ZEKE
I cant feel a goddamn thing
(beat)
Better get started on the tarp

STEPH
Okay

Zeke heads for the front of the bank

EXT FIRST MACKEY BANK - FRONT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

From outside the bank we see Zeke walk calmly but quickly
towards the front door of the bank with his gun drawn
Andy is halfway down the stairs already his mask half
over his face but twisted so that he cant see anything
He struggles to get to the door of Chris car as Chris
repeatedly turns the key in the ignition even though the
car is already running producing a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE
from the STARTER Zeke calmly watches this unfold He
waits until Andy is safely in the car and the pair are
halfway out of the parking lot before sending a few
VOLLEYS from his GUN up into the air

As soon as theyre gone Zeke heads back into the bank

INT FIRST MACKEY BANK - FRONT ROOM

Zeke makes his way to the back room of the bank
INT FIRST MACKEY BANK —- BACK ROOM —- SAME TIME

Zeke arrives to find that Steph has opened the tarp and
laid it beside Eds body Together they push the body
onto the tarp then roll it up and tie it shut Zeke
attempts to lift it off the ground but cant because of
his shoulder

ZEKE
I cant

Steph steps over and together they drag both the duffel
bag and the body out the back door

EXT FIRST MACKEY BANK - BACK ALLEY

They drag the body down the back stairs and over to a
black Camaro with the license plate BITCHIN Together
they hoist both the duffel bag and the rolled up tarp
into the trunk They shut the trunk and Steph gets
behind the wheel of the car and closes the door She
opens the window and leans out

STEPH
What are we gonna do with all the money

ZEKE
We can burn it for all I care

STEPH
I was thinking we should do something
with it that Ed Jr would be proud of

ZEKE
I like that idea But theres still a
lot of work to do

He reaches into his belt and pulls out Eds white-handled
gun

ZEKE (CONTD)
Youll need to find a decent match for
Eds gun Looks like a model 27 Smith
and Wesson

STEPH
Okay

ZEKE
Now go
He steps away from the car and she drives off As soon
as shes gone he heads back into the bank

(Reed is bent over at the
waist struggling for air)
Oh my god thats a lot of blood

EXT SHIMMER LAKE - SHORE - NIGHT

Eds Camaro turns onto the same dusty road by the shore
of the lake that we saw at the end of Friday night
Parked there is the same beat-up looking white Ford
Taurus we saw Steph pull up in on Friday The Camaro
slows down and then turns abruptly left into the brush

HUGE PIT

has been dug about ten yards into the brush and the car
drives straight down the slope and into the pit The car
fits completely inside the hole but the fit is tight
enough that Steph has to climb out of the drivers side
window to get out

STEPH

scales the slope and opens the trunk The car is at an
awkward angle and it takes all of Stephs effort to
retrieve the bag from inside the trunk and drag it out of
the pit and onto solid land

ADJACENT TO HOLE

A massive mound of unearthed dirt sits with a shovel
sticking out of it Without hesitating Steph grabs the
shovel and begins heaving the soil back into the hole

Zeke sits in a chair while a pair of EMT MEN clean the
wound in his shoulder Reed and the two State Troopers
huddle together on the other side of the room

EMT MAN 2

the bullet and make the wound worse

lifts the duffel onto the back bumper of her Taurus and
then topples it inside She takes a deep breath exhales
slowly and then gets in and drives off
