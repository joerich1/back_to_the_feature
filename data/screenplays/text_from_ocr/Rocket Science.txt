INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - BALCONY - NIGHT

Wide shot of the auditorium balcony area where unseen by
anyone a TEENAGE COUPLE make out

TITLE CARD “SPRING”

DEBATE OFFICIAL (0S)
The Affirmative will please begin

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

A BOY and a GIRL in matching prep-school jackets sit hunched
over a work table on one side of a big stage A card on the
table reads “NEGATIVE Townsend Prep”

On the other side of the stage a boy and a girl in gray and
blue business attire sit at their own work table Their card
reads “AFFIRMATIVE Plainsboro High” The girl from
Plainsboro is GINNY RYERSON the boy BEN WEKSELBAUM Ben
rises to the podium

In the audience we see COACH LUMBLY Plainsboro’s debate
teacher watching intently

Ben appears stately as if from an old photograph black
hair bow-tie and white boutonniere a serious and handsome
sixteen year-old But if his look is yesteryear his oration
is thoroughly modern Ben gasps and then sprints through his
delivery as fast as the fastest auctioneer and with the same
crisp attention to his syllables This pattern of gasping
sprinting and shouting certain key words is the way of all
great high school policy debaters

BEN
(at light-speed)

It will come as no surprise to the
judges our esteemed opponents from
Townsend Prep nor really to anyone
at all in the audience that we the
Affirmative from Plainsboro High do
hereby support this year’s national
policy debate resolution which I am
supposed to recite now as if
after an entire school year it
could still somehow be unknown to
any of us That is ridiculous
Therefore instead of senselessly
repeating it I will offer up a
moment of silence during which I’d
like every one of you to say the
resolution aloud

(MORE)
BEN (contd)
It will be a final communal act
for all of us the high school
policy debaters of New Jersey
Ready set go

AUDIENCE (0S)
Resolved that the federal
government should--

BEN
For those of you who aren’t done I
apologize but there’s a reason why
I’m up here and you’re down there
and if you please right now
we’re gonna go at my pace Hang
on if you can (Some kids in the
audience CHEER Ben inhales
sharply and literally doubles his
pace) Our plan today is succinct
only by becoming a fully socialist
regime will the United States
government ever emerge as the true
moral leader of the free world and
thus create a lasting peace
Therefore we support amending the
Constitution of the United States
to outlaw all political parties
that do not embrace socialism as
their core philosophy

The team from Townsend Prep--RAM AGGARWAL and RAM’S PARTNER--
type furiously into laptops while Ben rattles off his points
Ram’s Partner looks very conservative and very nervous Ram
on the other hand has semi-punk hair and is as cool a
customer as you can be at fifteen

Ram’s partner shakes his head exasperated It’s grim for
them and they both know it

The VO begins This is an omniscient commentator a rich and
wise and flawless voice

NARRATOR (VO)
On the stage of the New Jersey
State High School Policy Debate
Championships that spring night
stood Ben Wekselbaum of Plainsboro
High To anyone who ever heard Ben
debate there was one thing that was
undeniable he had a voice Even
then on that May night a real
voice

We cut to a close-up of Ben
BEN
(keeping up his pace)

You’re all wondering when on earth
is he going to get to farming
subsidies At long last as
promised the link to farming which
is no doubt obvious by now
Agricultural societies collapse
under capitalism and thrive under
socialism Therefore socialism is
the best form of subsidies I
refer you to the following three
terrific quotes in support of that
contention

Back at the affirmative table sits Ginny Ryerson She’s not
pretty in the classic bullshit American sense but still
she’s so full of herself so pure in her anger and strength
there’s something hugely persuasive about her She looks up
at Ben full of admiration

NARRATOR (VO)

As Ben Wekselbaum set out the
complexities of their plan his
partner was biding her time
picturing how it would look up
there the only trophy missing from
her crowded gleaming shelf

We PUSH-IN on the trophy table backstage toward the big one
in the center the real prize she wants and deserves

At the Townsend Prep table Ram types furiously into his
laptop while Ram’s partner flips through notebooks pulling
out pages of paper and highlighting quotes

NARRATOR (VO)

One team on the affirmative arguing
for the resolution The other on
the negative tearing it down

LATER-—
Ram at the podium

RAM
(fast)
This year’s national resolution is
specifically about farming
subsidies Not socialism
(MORE)
RAM (contd)
By overstepping the resolution they
haven’t met their prima facie
burden to defend said resolution
and the should be considered
untopical

LATER-—
Ginny at the podium

GINNY RYERSON

(fast)
“Subsidies are at their heart an
extension of socialism” That’s

from Gutierrez ‘03 That the
negative team has no legitimate
arguments against socialism isn’t
our fault They didn’t penetrate
the subject as deeply as they
should have

LATER-—
Ram’s Partner at the podium

RAM’S PARTNER

(fast)
To suggest that we haven’t refuted
the very basis of socialism is
fallacious and specious I refer
you again to the delicious quotes
my partner read regarding the
nature of communism

In the front row of the audience THREE JUDGES jot notes on
yellow legal pads

NARRATOR (VO)
And so it goes the high school
debate like the war that rips
through your city and ravages
everything in its path Kids
wielding words like weapons and
brandishing ideas like axes It
was that war that in its final
battle of the school year that
night And 46 miles away Hal
Hefner was at home like nothing or
none of New Jersey was burning
around him
EXT PLAINSBORO STREET- NIGHT

We track down the empty street it’s just the sleepy suburbs
at night nothing more

INT JULIET’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Hal Hefner sits in the living room rubbing the belly of his
dog Charlotte He’s occupying himself as best he can
trying not to listen to the fight going on upstairs

Hal seems as unexceptional as unexceptional can be a real
kid yes but an inconsequential one too Ordinary to the
Nth so much so that sitting in a crowded classroom he might
completely vanish

We see a few PHOTOS of the Hefner family

Somewhere in Juliet’s house upstairs from Hal a door SLAMS
and PITCHED VOICES follow

JULIET (0S)
What do you want me to say

DOYLE (0S)
Cut the shouting I don’t want
anything in that tone

NARRATOR (VO)
That night Hal Hefner had hardly a
voice at all

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
Back to the stage Ben still reading at light-speed

NARRATOR (VO)
Back on the stage of the State
championships the night at last
revealed itself as not just any
night but as the night The night
when it all began Ben Wekselbaum
the best voice to ever debate for
PHS Plainsboro high according to
anyone who ever heard him that Ben
Wekselbaum he just went quiet

Pushing in on Ben at the podium
BEN

(blazingly fast)
»our next Advantage basically
says that human relations can only
thrive in an atmosphere of total
equality That human relations can
only exist-- I’m sorry I just
said that Or no-- I mean ina
space where the playing field is
level-- a place of total equality
Wait wait

He stops and looks out into the darkness
Ginny looks up what’s going on

Ram and Ram’s Partner catch up with their typing shake out
their cramped hands and look up

Were very tight on Ben as an unusual semi-smile blooms on
his face

GINNY RYERSON
Ben

INT JULIET’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Hal’s into full wrestle mode with Charlotte

EARL HEFNER 17 comes in brushing his teeth absentmindedly
Earl’s a strange bird a hyper-organized kid but also one
weirdly full of troubling behavior We see this blend in his
well-orchestrated clothing ensemble and the beginnings of a
horrible moustache too close to a Hitler for comfort

DOYLE HEFNER walks downstairs with a big suitcase in hand and
pulling a small awkward carry-on bag

DOYLE
Hal Earl I have these I’m not
going to be living here anymore
And that’s why I have these
suitcases

JULIET (0S)
They’re a set Doyle Leave the
big bag with the rest of it Lord
that’s so you

Doyle in anger opens up the small carry-on bag grabs his
clothes out of there and throws the empty bag up the stairs
as best he can which isn’t very good
He has no intention of leaving the big bag Insanely he
SCREAMS toward the upstairs Then tries to compose himself
for his sons

DOYLE
You’re going to be fine and I’11
see you sometime soon I’m not
sure what else to say I can’t put
it into words

Doyle exits lugging the big suitcase random clothes tucked
under his arms

NARRATOR (VO)
46 miles apart at the very same
moment the arguments stopped So
there was this bridge of silence
across Jersey No shouting from
Hal’s parents no debating no
voice no one’s voice at all

We hear just CHARLOTTE’S PANTING

FAST MONTAGE--

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Ram and Ram’s Partner hold a giant trophy and settle on a

grin for a PHOTOGRAPHER

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - AUDITORIUM - GIRL’S ROOM - NIGHT

Ginny sits in a stall crying hysterically With one hand
she takes a long drag from a cigarette With the other she
grips handfuls of her hair

EXT MONMOUTH STREET - NIGHT

We’re outside tracking with a taxi cab that holds Ben
Wekselbaum inside He’s got his head up against the window
and he’s crying and grinning like a madman A total and
glorious breakdown and yet somehow his bow-tie is still
perfectly cinched

NARRATOR (VO)
That year’s national debate topic
was farming subsidies

(MORE)
NARRATOR (VO) (contd)
And if you don’t know how farming
subsidies could inspire all this
commotion then you don’t know life
and there’s nothing to be said
about it Suitcases end marriages
and farming subsidies launch
cataclysms

INT JULIET’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Hal and Earl at the living room window
ANGLE OUT THE WINDOW--

They watch Doyle load the big suitcase and his free clothes
into a sedan

He gets in and the car pulls away backing into a garbage
container toppling it over onto the sidewalk Doyle
corrects and as the car circles around and drives off it
leaves behind a GHOSTED IMAGE OF ITSELF

NARRATOR (VO)
Can a voice or the spirit of a
voice travel from one person to
another like yawning or laughter or
mono Sure it can that’s our
position That the will to speak
traveled that night across the dark
NJ highways not even stopping at
the rest areas along the turnpike
but kept going until it arrived on
this very block where it would take
up residence or try to in someone
new

Tight on Hal as he lingers at the window staring out at the
translucent car rumbling in the dark driveway

A CLOSER ANGLE--

The GHOSTED IMAGE OF DOYLE sitting at wheel

EXT PLAINSBORO HOUSE - DAY

Earl races out of the house a simple book bag thrown over
his shoulder

Calling back to the house--

EARL
Gladys let’s go Timeliness is an
important part of it

Earl arrives at the school bus at the same moment that
HESTON the boy from next door walks down his front lawn and
up to the bus Heston looks oddly neat and prim and
generally walks like he should be carrying a kite string in
his hand

EARL
Heston

HESTON
Earl

Heston jumps onto the bus and Earl after him It lets loose
a moaning HORN

Hal (the “Gladys” in question) emerges from the house
tugging behind him the small carry-on bag his father left
behind It has one wheel that keeps jamming up

INT SCHOOL BUS - DAY

Toward the back Hal sits alone the carry-on suitcase
hoisted up beside him

HAL
(quietly rehearsing)

Hal turns around to look at Heston smiling

HESTON
Sounds delicious

Hal faces forward and shuts up

EXT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
ENGLISH TEACHER stands in front

ENGLISH TEACHER
What kind of name is ‘O Henry’

The class is silent We push in on Hal He writes down “nom
de plume” in his loose-leaf notebook The notebook is jammed
full of words that have been crossed out

No one answers

ENGLISH TEACHER
Not ‘pseudonym’ which we all know
but how about ‘nom de plume’ Does
‘nom de plume’ sound right It
does to me It was toward the end
in the reading that no one seems to
have completed

Hal crosses it out in his notebook Just another word that
will never be spoken
INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Hal in line moving in lock step with other kids As he
moves he mouths “Just the pizza slice of the pizza”

It’s his turn He steps up Stares hard at the LUNCH LADY
in front of him Doesn’t say anything

LUNCH LADY
Fish or pizza

Hal shuts his eyes and breathes deeply

LUNCH LADY (CONTD)
Pizzas plain or pep Fish’s not

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Hal walks into the main eating area and through it to his
table

Several seats away is Heston

They eat in silence

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - COUNSELING ROOM - DAY

Hal sitting across a desk from LEWINSKY the school’s all-
purpose therapist In the room sitting in the corner doing
math problems is HONORIA She’s either young or small or
both Her hair and clothes are simple She remains
generally unconnected in the corner staring up or down
writing furiously something minorly autistic about her

Hal inhales and exhales purposefully Lewinsky inhales and
exhales with him

LEWINSKY
Do you want to keep on trying with
the breathing exercises or
something new

HAL
I have is it alright if I have no
opinion

LEWINSKY (CONT’D)
Let’s try this (Lewinsky starts
to whisper) I read in this
journal Clinical Pathways of
Speech Pathology that it’s hard to
be anything but fluent when you
whisper or sing I’ve sent away
for a video tape of some people
trying that out Not a solution
obviously but want to give ita
shot

HAL
(whispering)
That’s too stupid clearly I
cant do this Isn’t this too
stupid Honoria Even for Honoria
that’s too stupid I can just feel
it

She doesn’t react

LEWINSKY
I explained this Hal that it’s
not my speciality I’m sorry I’m
trying It’s really a shame you’re
not hyperactive because that I know
well That I can work miracles
with Hyperactivity But this is
something else

He goes back to breathing exercises As do Hal and Honoria

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

There’s an assembly in progress with a couple adults dressed
as ABRAHAM LINCOLN and STEPHEN DOUGLAS Cheery COACH LUMBLY
“moderates” this debate She’s in her normal school attire
but strangely wears a pilgrim’s hat

Hal sits between FLEMMING (a Pete Rose type full of anger
and determination) and Heston Earl sits in the back no one
around him

COACH LUMBLY
It was 1858 and while Senator
Stephen Douglas set out his case
that states ought to choose whether
to allow slavery Abraham Lincoln
consulted with the smart citizens
of Illinois to plot his answer

The Woman Dressed as Abraham Lincoln turns to the audience

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
Let me find now a citizen to assist
me in coming up with arguments
against Senator Douglas Where can
I find such a citizen-helper

A handful of hands shoot up Most kids can’t believe how
awful this is

FLEMMING
Put your hand down Heston This
is all me

The Woman Dressed as Lincoln points to Hal who conspicuously
does not have his hand up

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
The commoner in the striped plum-
colored shirt We need you sir
Rise to your duty

FLEMMING
The he-she means you Hef Get up
We’1ll watch the bag

But Hal stays rooted to his seat suitcase beside him

Earl from the back--

EARL
Striped Plum passes thanks Pick
again

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
Come now Senator Douglas has laid
out a formidable argument and I am
but an unknown congressman Bring
up a loose-leaf notebook and let’s
make some notes

Everyone waits

A few kids start to halfheartedly CHANT Striped-plum
Striped-plum Plummy-shirt

Hal opens his suitcase and we see inside a completely
chaotic space with text books notebooks and free papers

Hal takes out a notebook and slowly full of dread walks up
to the stage Lincoln takes his hand and shakes it
vigorously

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
My assistant has come to offer me
arguments in my debate against the
Senator

STEPHEN DOUGLAS
(very arch)
Now I’m quaking

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
What cannot a house divided against
itself do It is this argument
that will lead me to victory What
cannot it do

She hands a microphone to Hal
He shuts his eyes and breathes heavily into it
STEPHEN DOUGLAS
Hold that further away from your
mouth

Hal stares at Stephen Douglas with burning hatred

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
What cannot a house divided do

STEPHEN DOUGLAS
Is it Sit Smell Sally-forth

Two kids in the audience shout out No

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
Tell us then lad

HAL
It can’t well a house divided it
can’t you know A house divided
can not It just can not Mrs
President it just cannot just

Hal stops cold Looks out into the crowd Some kids watch
Many have stopped paying attention Still it’s awfully
quiet and it’s horrible

ANGLE ON GINNY RYERSON --

She’s engrossed in the spectacle on stage Sitting around
her are some other members of the DEBATE TEAM including
PHILIP and CRYSTAL HAMISH-STEINBERG They are utterly bored
ANGLE ON STAGE --

WOMAN DRESSED AS LINCOLN
Some help from the citizenry

A small wave from the audience breaks on Hal
A BUNCH OF KIDS
‘Stand’ Can’t ‘stand’
(One jerk calls out) Oh I thought
it was ‘Shit Itself’

Hal hands the mic off to Coach Lumbly and steps off stage and
goes back to his seat

ANGLE ON--

Hal back in his seat Flemming stares at him a mixture of
pity and disgust

HESTON
You look taller on stage

Hal has no reply but to look straight ahead at the stage

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - JANITOR’S CLOSET - DAY

Hal stands in an empty janitor’s closet hyperventilating
It’s very dark and Hal seems stricken His breathing is

horrible and dramatic He looks like he might cry at any
moment

Suddenly the door opens A JANITOR looks at Hal Doesn’t
say a word He rolls his mop and mop bucket inside and then
closes the door

INT SCHOOL BUS - DAY

Hal traumatized by the afternoon leans against his
suitcase On the aisle sitting beside him is Earl

Hal stares out the window--
Plainsboro rushes by
On the bus--

Heston sits behind them and on the bench seat next to Heston
is Ginny Ryerson She stares at Hal

EARL
Want to hear your problem

Hal doesn’t answer

EARL (CONT’D)
Agnes

HAL
I’m trying you know not to
listen distinctly not to but
youre one foot away

EARL
You’ve no agenda Strictly head in
the ground material Look at me I
wake up every morning and what do I
do

Hal gives him a withering “who the fuck cares” look

EARL (CONTD)
I create an agenda for the day
which is a sub-agenda for the month
which is itself a pie-slice of my
agenda for life You want to know
today’s purpose

HAL
I I I no I can promise you
that no no Absolutely I do not

EARL
Youd probably call the cops on me

anyway
From behind them Ginny Ryerson leans in
GINNY RYERSON
(To Earl) You Adolph switch with

me upsy-daisy

EARL
This is my seat

GINNY RYERSON
Like all seats on this vehicle
yours has been paid for with
taxpayer money which means that I
or anyone else has as much right to
it as do you In fact given the
distinction between what your
family surely pays in taxes and
mine I think it’s safe to say that
the seat is substantially more mine
than yours Do you see now I’11
be taking just a minute to talk to
the little man and then you can go
on borrowing my seat for as long as
youd like until I want it again
right

She grins a smug one Though he’s not happy about it Earl’s
no match for Ginny He rises up slides in where she had
been sitting Ginny sits next to Hal

GINNY RYERSON (CONT’D)
Coach Lumbly with the pilgrim hat
she teaches Patterns of Adult
Living On her third husband name
of Wallace Lumbly Wallace the
third That’s a particular pattern
she doesn’t lecture us on in class
Well she came up to me after a
presentation on egalitarianism and
said that although my argumentative
skills were at the fetal stage she
sensed somehow she intuited my
potential and invited me onto the
team and so two years later here
I am doing the same with you
Recruiting Ferreting out the
debating talent from the masses
That’s you I’ve ferreted you

HAL
Public speaking in public that
seems like a very bad a very
very like a very (He takes a
heavy BEAT) You see where I’m
going with this

GINNY RYERSON
Resolved That the Federal
Government should support the
teaching of abstinence in public
schools From sex

(MORE )

GINNY RYERSON (contd)
Itd a big step up from farming
that was last year’s resolution

HAL
Yeah no

GINNY RYERSON
Suit yourself But deformed people
are the best Maybe it’s because
they have a deep resource of anger
that serves them well

HAL
I’1ll I’ll but uh no

ANGLE ON--
Earl in Ginny’s seat He casually unzips the front pocket of
her backpack and slips his hand inside His face gives away
nothing
BACK ON GINNY AND HAL--
There’s a beat of silence
GINNY RYERSON

Are you about to say something

I thought you might be stuck trying

to say “Thank you” Were you

trying to say “Thank you”

Hal is again speechless

The bus slows and comes to a stop beside a sign “Entering
Grover’s Mill”

Ginny leans in very close to Hal
GINNY RYERSON (CONT’D)
(whispering)

You’re welcome

She stands reaches back over Earl to grab her backpack
slings it over her shoulder and exits

ANGLE ON--

Through the windows of the bus as it pulls away Hal watches
Ginny stride up the path to her house

Without turning around she adjusts her jeans and then lifts
a long arm into the air and waves dramatically for Hal’s
benefit

Hal twists to watch her go inside and keep on watching until
after the Ryerson house is long gone

Earl slides in again next to Hal
EARL
Tomorrow’s agenda is to glue her
locker shut

They eat quietly

JUDGE PETE

JULIET

swear I’m more nervous than anyone

JUDGE PETE
Honestly Jules I’m a small claims
judge It’s lucky I’m not dating
someone from Trenton

No one knows what to make of this Judge Pete gives himself
a HUGE LAUGH

JULIET
(changing the subject)
Is this a traditional Korean dish
Because it has a very exotic odor

JUDGE PETE

Again no one knows what to make of it The table returns to
silence

INT JULIET’S HOUSE - HAL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hal puts the pillow over his face

INT JULIET’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Hal plays with his dog Heston sits on the sofa looking at a
picture calendar

HESTON
My dad hasn’t dated anyone before
your mom for six years

HAL
OK can we not you know just not
talk about that

There’s a BEAT OF SILENCE

HESTON
I found this by a tree stump in the
park

Heston holds up his calendar It’s a classic beefcake job
with shirtless men in cowboy hats and jeans

HESTON (cont’d)
Look at this month

It’s a good one Hal doesn’t know what to make of it He
ignores the strangeness of Heston’s calender and goes back to
wrestling with his dog

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY

Hal Flemming and Heston stand together part of a bigger
line of kids shooting arrows into hay-stuffed targets on the
other side of the gym

NARRATOR (VO)
But then on a Thursday It could
have been any day but it wasnt
It was Thursday And for no good
reason something happened and it
was like a little wave breaking
over him A ocean wave

(MORE)
NARRATOR (VO) (contd)
And it said the name G-I-N-N-Y
Ginny Over and over Ginny
Ginny Ginny

Hal draws his arm back aims at the target in front of him

and as he lifts his fingers
INSERT--

Ginny through the school bus

her arm in the air

THE GYM--

The arrow drops to the floor

exactly nowhere

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

Hal walks through an emptying hallway

through the door

Hal’s POV--

Ginny stands in front of the classroom debating

It the midst of the spreading the shot of her goes into

motion

she walks to the door opens it and steps out into the

hallway

GINNY
The etymology of the word
‘spreading’ is unclear but we
believe that it’s the lumping
together of speed and reading
spreading all it is is jamming as
Many arguments into your time your
8 minute constructive or your 4
minute rebuttal as possible (She
begins spreading) Consider
Contention 1 Early Sexual
Relations Are Harmful Radzinger
‘03 ‘The effects of early sexual
relations include transmission of
diseases out of wedlock pregnancy
and a host of potential illnesses
including depression and low self-
esteem”

to set the arrow free--

at Hal’s feet having moved

window her back to Hal waving

He stops and peers

slo-

She spots Hal outside She continues spreading as

The speed ramps back to normal

GINNY
‘participation in the program
was 53 more likely to yield
positive results and strengthen
anti-sexual impulses among teens--’
(She stops spreading to Hal) You
know the other thing I meant to say
is that you look like this guy I
used to debate with--in a shorter
goofier kind of way--and why would
you be here looking enough like
him if I squinted or if it was
darker if it wasn’t for me to
discover you and those talents that
are hidden within Destiny

HAL
Hi

Ginny consider him for a flirtatious beat allows herself a
smile

GINNY
Hi

Hal is smitten doesn’t know what to say Here’s what he
comes up with

GINNY
Resolved that Hal Hefner should
really stop letting the world tell
him what’s possible and try to find
out for himself Maybe that’s just
a life’s philosophy suited only to
some of us those who cherish
winning So maybe it’s not for
you But I think it is (Back to
spreading) ‘The quality of life
among teens who refrain (aka
TWR) is anecdotally higher than
teens who indulge (aka TWI)
When given the choice who wouldn’t
want to be among TWR” That’s
from Bonofsky ‘04 If you’re
paying attention you’re noting
grounds to argue against the case
based largely on effects
topicality There’s even more
coming up in Contention 2

Shuts door

EXT RYERSON HOUSE - DAY

Hal rides a bicycle past the “Entering Grover’s Mill” sign as
part of his circling in front of the Ryerson’s house He
coasts onto the sidewalk turns around and coasts back onto
the quiet street rides up to the sidewalk across the street

NARRATOR (VO)

Before this there was the
nothingness of Plainsboro New
Jersey But now Hal Hefner no
longer thought of this and that
and the parts of his brain that had
once been turned over to mulling
those things suddenly had only one
thought And it felt like all his
life his brain had been waiting for
this thought so comfortably now
did it fit in and take up all the
room there was

LEWIS GARRLES 11 wanders down from his house across the
street from the Ryerson’s

LEWIS
You’re on my street

Hal glides down to the street

LEWIS (cont’d)
You’re still on my street

HAL
This is this right here is you

puts it on over his shirt

HAL

WALKING AND TALKING THROUGH THE HALLWAY--

HAL (CONTD)
I just talked to Coach to you
know to Mrs or Ms which is it
anyway to her to Lumbly and
tomorrow I’m going to actually come
inside during debate prep So I’m
on the team just like you wanted

GINNY RYERSON
Someone took something of mine
that’s invaluable for anti-
sentimental reasons though
whatever the reasons are are no
one’s business but my own

HAL
I just said did you hear I said
I said I thanks to you I joined
the team

GINNY RYERSON
I had a locket a silver Deco
locket with two pictures inside
Ringing any bells One was of me
and the other was of someone else
a boy of sorts

HAL
What’s a Deco

GINNY RYERSON
My mother believes one of her
pseudo-friends stole it because he
or even she is secretly a pedophile
and wanted my locket to stare into
or suck on or utilize for other
specific erotic purposes but I told
her that I have this hunch this
sinister hunch that it was taken
out of my backpack by someone at
PHS It’s like I sensed it leaving
my presence just an ounce but a
burning ounce as it left my
person

HAL
I doubt if the if the pedophile
things could be could be true
That seems it seems but then I
don’t know too much about that to
be honest But but but you
know I can’t believe anyone would
think of you like that

GINNY RYERSON
Like what

HAL
Sex sex Sexually I mean

GINNY RYERSON
That’s the worst thing anyone’s
ever said to me Why would you say
that

Hal goes into speechless hyperventilation
GINNY RYERSON (CONT’D)

I never should have asked you to

join the team Lord knows what I

was only thinking

HAL
Uh yeah --

GINNY
His name’s Ben Wekselbaum and we
debated together before he freaked
out in the final round at States
and left me with a lousy second-
place trophy I’ve never felt
anything like that Have you ever
felt like you could burn the world
down

HAL
Every day

a beat with it

GINNY
He dropped out of high school and
though he never did have the
decency to call I heard through the
grapevine that his grandmother got
him a job at the world-renowned
Luis Dry Cleaners in Trenton

HAL
I I don’t think I’ve ever heard of

it

GINNY
Anyway ultimately it’s a good
thing that the spirit of
cowardliness overtook Ben
Wekselbaum because it has left
my partner arrangement free this

year and allowed me
someone I can mold into

to find
the kind of

bare-knuckles debater that I want

to debate with
debaters are the ones wi
something to prove I
rise above the fiasco of
at States You trying
the world that you’re no

The very best

th

trying to
last year
to prove to
t as

retarded as you sometimes sound

Which is why I want you

to overlook

the embarrassment that comes with
having taken my locket and join up
with the team after all

GINNYS MOTHER (0S)
You’re on dishes tonight
Virginia

GINNY RYERSON

I am Joanie yes and it’s a good
thing I am--

HAL

Hal jumps up lunges to his door to open it but Earl’s
holding it shut from the other side

EARL (0S)

girlfriend before me it will haunt
you to your grave Don’t do it
little shit don’t do it
Earl releases the door and Hal falls backwards into the room

Hal jumps up and slams his door shut

EXT PLAINSBORO STREET - DAY

Hal nods enters

INT RYERSON HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY

Hal walks through the entryway up the stairs It’s a whole
new world and he takes it in

At top of the stairs he sees Ginny’s bedroom door open and
just a sliver of her inside He pauses to study her

He does

INT RYERSON HOUSE - GINNY’S ROOM - DAY

Hal sits on her bed Ginny sits by the window smoking a
cigarette and blowing the smoke outside They are each
reading debate briefs Ginny gives a sound of appreciation
for something she’s just read (Um-hm” or the like) and Hal
secretly sneaking a look at her tries out one of his own
She looks up at him he smiles are her

HAL
So yeah what do you believe in
when it comes to abstinence

GINNY RYERSON
Top debaters we never really
believe in anything It gets in the
way of arguing both sides

HAL
But what about for yourself in
your own life
He thinks

GINNY RYERSON
Debate is life You shouldn’t
think about it in any other
context

HAL
Because in my mind it’s nota
good thing abstinence isn’t I
don’t think Not for kids in New
Jersey

GINNY RYERSON
That’s enough tangential bullshit
Write down these template arguments
against abstinence supporting
it violates the barrier between
church and state its an
enforcement of a dated sexist
agenda sexual freedom is the
basis of human freedom abstinence separates us from other
Western cultures Europe in
particular when we should be
drawing closer to our international
allies psychologists say that
repressed sexual functions creates
adult neuroses abstinence
programs actually increase risky
sexual behavior among teens it
creates barriers between free-love
generation parents and their more
conservative children and
finally we oppose abstinence
because the world might end and
then the tragedy is that everyone
we know basically dies a virgin

HAL
Wow yes all that when you think
about it

GINNY RYERSON
Now argue it from the other side
In preparation for our first
official debate exercise next week
show me that you can argue in favor
of it

it over
HAL

I think I’d be better at arguing
the other side of this

GINNY RYERSON
Hal

HAL
I thought the only one I can come
up with so far is that it makes the
thing the thing being love it
makes it more special when you do
find it

GINNY RYERSON
The ‘special love’ case Probably
that stinks but I’11 think about it
some more and we’ll see

She flips through a book of evidence Hal can’t take his eyes
from her

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH - LIBRARY - DAY

Hal sits at a table in the library One table away sits a
JUNIOR PHILOSOPHER He’s reading a book and he chortles over
something

JUNIOR PHILOSOPHER

Hey would you be interested in
joining my club of Junior
Philosophers

HAL
I I my plate is kind of full

JUNIOR PHILOSOPHER

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - LUMBLY’S CLASSROOM - DAY

Coach Lumbly in front At desks beside her are Ginny Hal

PHILIP and CRYSTAL HAMISH-STEINBERG
including Flemming sits in back

COACH LUMBLY

The rest of the TEAM

Once I was your age just as quiet
on the inside as most of you novice
debaters are Quiet as a mouse or
a stone or a bowl of pudding And
then I saw my first debate and the
pudding was no more None of you

novices understands me now

You

will Until then the thing to
remember is that however thrilling
it is to speak up to argue to
wake up that brain for the first
time there are rules that must be
followed That’s debate and that’s
life Our exercise today is an
accelerated run-through of a
complete debate round to teach you

those rules

FLEMMING

Why is the Hal Hefner bowl of
pudding allowed to demonstrate to

us

COACH LUMBLY

He’s a first-year that’s true but
Ms Ryerson has assured me that
he’s a quick study and a rare
talent and that he’1l be able to
instruct and enlighten us today
Our debate begins with Ginny the
First Affirmative delivering an 8
minute opening speech For our
purposes Ginny will synopsize that

down to ten seconds

GINNY RYERSON--

GINNY RYERSON
(spreading)

Good afternoon ladies and germs

(MORE )
CRYSTAL-—

PHILIP-—

GINNY RYERSON (contd)
Our affirmative case today in
effect states that increased
teenage pregnancies will eventually
bankrupt social security destroy
our economy and result in the third
world war Therefore we will
quadruple the federal spending
given only to schools that teach
abstinence to their students
Thank you

COACH LUMBLY
That was lucid thank you Now
there’s a two minute cross-
examination Second Negative to
First Affirmative Crystal Hamish-
Steinberg is the Second Negative
Crystal Hamish-Steinberg give us
an exemplary question that you
would ask

CRYSTAL HAMISH-STEINBERG
Have you ever heard of Bangladesh

COACH LUMBLY
The perfect tease You women may
sit while the First Negative rises
to respond to Ginny Philip

PHILIP

(spreading)
Rather than attack the affirmative
case Crystal Hamish-Steinberg and
I propose the following negative
counterplan we grant all the harms
claimed by the affirmative but
state that the better way to combat
teenage pregnancy is by pouring
money into a huge rock concert that
well dub the ‘Concert for
Sexlessness’ We believe this will
be a more effective than teaching
abstinence in public schools where
no one pays attention to their
teachers anyway present teacher
excepted

COACH LUMBLY
Thank you Instead of arguing
against the harms caused by teen
promiscuity the negative has
interestingly granted all that but
offered up their own plan that they
claim is better Now First
Affirmative cross-examines First
Negative

Ginny stands beside Philip

GINNY RYERSON
Do you have statistics on how many
rock stars practice abstinence

PHILIP
How many rock stars who performed
at the historic ‘Concert for
Bangladesh’ were Bangladeshi

GINNY RYERSON
I’ll ask the questions here
Philip

COACH LUMBLY
The combatants sit Now Hal Hefner
wows us with his Second
Affirmative another 8 minute
speech boiled down here to ten
seconds

Hal finishes writing out a sentence on his legal pad and
underlining it He rises He breathes dramatically in and
out

NARRATOR (VO)
Three were three immediate lines of
argumentation that came to mind but
the best one went like this the
plans are not mutually exclusive
increased funding for school
programs doesn’t preclude the
negative team’s badly-named
‘Concert for Sexlessness’ We can
and should do them both

Not a word comes out of Hal’s mouth
On his pad he’s written Not Mutually Exclusive

There’s Coach Lumbly
Another GROUP OF KIDS

Flemming who raises his arms what’s up

Hal keeps breathing deeply

Hal purses his lips hard

NARRATOR (VO)
Hal Hefner visualized himself in
that moment as the kind of kid who
comes up with three arguments and
says them all The kind of kid who
can state ‘The plans are not
mutually exclusive’ whenever he
wants to say so ‘The plans are
not mutually exclusive’ ‘The
plans are not no they aren’t not
mutually exclusive’

Then Ginny rises into shot

GINNY RYERSON

(spreading)
Ill be handling Hal Hefner’s cross-—
x and rebuttal speech until the
first actual debate tournament at
Hazlet against other actual
schools Until then he will be my
silent partner Hal Hefner sit
down

Instead of sitting Hal bursts out of the room

HAL (0S)
I don’t I’m not sure who that is

GINNY RYERSON
You start out slovenly and then you
get better Not Bob Dole but
pretty much anybody else

A total and awful speech block

EARL
I’m glad you came to me because
this is exactly the sort of
question that mom and dad would
royally screw up See it’s all
about having an agenda which they
would never tell you When you’ve
got a plan like today I’m going
to get a blowjob then it helps you
realize that It’s all very
scientific

HAL
I doubt I’m just a doubter that
giving me a BJ is high on Ginny’s
list

EARL
Youre her partner right So you
wait until the moment’s right
after you crack a good a really
good joke like the one I tell about
the Queen of England and then ask
You never know and it’s worth the
risk Believe me It is worth the
risk It’s like walking through a
brick wall

HAL
Ginny says that I won’t be a real
partner for months and that until
then I’m like the mascot the
dysfluent mascot the dyfluent
mascot not getting a BJ

LEWINSKY
My ex-girlfriend the PhD at
Annenberg she used to say that her
brother never stuttered if he spoke
in an accent You could try
something subtle the accent you
know best and maybe that would
help Anyway I wouldn’t count on
it Mina’s advice was about as far-
fetched as she was Open
relationships just don’t work
Hal

HAL
What

LEWINSKY
I’m advising that you try to do an
accent OK That’s what I’m
telling you to do

Mine was cheerleading I was the
one boy on the cheerleading squad
Imagine that Gimme an H Gimme an
A Gimme an L What’s that spell
HAL

HAL
That image that’s not helping

LEWINSKY
Just because debate was a wipe-out
I mean a colossal wipe-out
doesn’t mean you’re a failure It
was the activity that failed you
There’s nothing to say you couldn’t
try for say the Spanish club
You could become Spanish club vice
president in no time

HONORIA
Kyle Filiwitz es el vice
presidente

LEWINSKY
My point Hal is that you have to
get out of your own way here Go
back to the way you were living
before you tried to exceed your
limitations It’s very dharmic
You don’t need to be anybody but
natural yourself and you don’t need
to prove anything to anybody

INT PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Hal seems in a disconnected state as if in a dream

Hal walks suitcaseless through the main hall
through the sloshy floor to get to class on time But Hal
somehow looks around as if he’s walked into school for the
first time

Kids hurry

A snowball explodes in the hallway near him but he doesn’t

flinch

The camera begins to pull back from him as all the kids
around him duck into their classes

Hal is the last one left standing stoically in the middle of

the hallway

NARRATOR (VO)
Hal Hefner floated above his life
saw the world around him as if he
were just a ghost floating through
Don’t pity the boy ghost Nothing
could harm him now nothing could
move him or pain him or make him
love again He was that kind of
ghost the kind that couldn’t love
again

EXT PLAINSBORO MUNICIPAL PARK - DAY

Hal walks through the park
neat and tidy everything in its place

of snow and slush

NARRATOR (VO)
As a boy ghost Hal Hefner surveyed
the world as he knew it And in
everything he saw was evidence that
life goes on with or without love
He had stopped thinking about the
girl had stopped dreaming about
her Or even if that wasn’t
entirely true had stopped dreaming
a certain kind of dream about her
Well maybe most of the time

Hal keeps walking

He stops at a park bench Sits on the bench

It’s classic community park
Covered in a blanket

The park Great oaks covered in snow Nothing special
Everything around him

WALKING AND TALKING DOWN THE STREET--

BEN
Man it’s a blessing to be squarely
and dearly out of the goddamn
suburbs They’1ll suck the marrow
right from you the suburbs will
and it takes years in the Big City
to inject the life back into you
literal years

HAL
Do you mean that this is that is
this is this the Big City do you
mean Trenton

BEN
That’s right Trenton

HAL
Oh

They walk for a BEAT

design to get me back to school--

to look him straightaway

looks around no bus) That’1l be

what you

leave behind on your way

I want is I want what I need is
just your help That’s all

BEN
supposedly drove a Chevy

Nova into the cafeteria in 1986

There’s
a water

a plaque somewhere next to
fountain in his honor

HAL
Why would he why would anyone
Anyway no your legend is better
than a wrecked Chevy Nova

BEN
Big bang Hal Anyone who doesn’t
shop at the Gap is basically a
legend in Plainsboro

They walk in silence while Hal mulls over what to say next

HAL
I’m going to be the next legend of
PHS Or if not a legend then not a
nobody And that’s not going to
happen for me any other way than to
win to win at States

Ben stops Hal stops too

BEN
Youre going to win States

HAL
Yes well we are yes

BEN
It’s all so pointless That’s the
realization I came to at States
last year Life is nothing but
repetition the same thing over and
over Somebody might give you a
trophy and that’s supposed to mean
youre making progress but there’s
no such thing The fights you
fight today and the fights you
fight your whole life

HAL
Be that as it may

BEN
Sure be that as it may

They’re in the middle of the street and Hal stops in his
tracks Ben stops with him

HAL
You’re not listening to me This
isn’t it’s not I’1ll tell you what
it’s not it’s not not not
college application bullshit that
is that is like that is the
driving force here or any bullshit

BEN
I’m sure

The light changes and traffic starts HONKING as it winds
around them

HAL
No I’1l tell you what it is

BEN
Yes What it is is

HAL
I’1l tell you what it is WHAT IT
IS What it is is is love Kind
of a special love (A BEAT) Or
if not that then the need for
revenge when love goes bad One of
those two Love or revenge One
of them I think made me throw a
cello through somebodys window
So you figure it out

BEN
An actual cello

HAL
I mean yeah symphony-sized as far
as I know

Ben starts to laugh

BEN
That’s sharp in my book as far as
reasons go

HAL
It does I’ll grant you it does
have a certain appeal

Hal joins in Ben’s laughter

Ben comes to a tenement building and pushes inside He holds
open the door for Hal

INT BEN’S APARTMENT - DAY

The door opens Ben enters Hal behind him taking it all
in

It’s an empty tenement apartment A bit of old furniture an
easel with a terrible painting on it and an old banjo in the
corner

Hal stops to consider the painting He has no idea what it
is

BEN
This goes against my better
judgement it does But what we’1l
need is one affirmative case
that’s all And one all-purpose
negative counterplan We can’t do
a year’s worth of work in one month
so we’ll concentrate on those two
lines of attack You’1l have to
arrange with your parents--do you
have parents

HAL
My mom’s at home And I see my dad
on some weekends

BEN
Youll have to come to some
arrangement with them or else let
go of trying to so that you can
spend evenings and weekends here
Well register as a home-school
team my grandmother will sign
whatever official paperwork is
required But all such
considerations wait on our
priority That’s finding you your
voice

What it is is one of those rare
instances where one of us having an
advanced college degree might
actually help

HAL
I will not whisper That’s a trick
but it’s a crap trick And I won’t
do an accent However good I may
be at them And that leaves
singing singing my speeches and

my ashes scattered over the

Ben thinks on it Hal watches him

INT BEN’S APARTMENT - DAY

Ben sits in his apartment tuning his banjo Hal stands by
looking dubious

Ben starts playing the Battle Hymn of the Republic on the
banjo

HAL
I don’t see I’ve thought about
this and I don’t think I can do
the song-thing

BEN
This is the Battle Hymn of the
Republic We might prefer
something more modern I realize
but this is the only piece I can
play all the way through What
youre going to do is just learn
the song well enough to keep it in
your head to let it flow through
you as you speak-sing your
speeches We’1ll write to fit the
rhyme

Ben starts singing

BEN
Mine eyes have seen the glory of
the coming of the Lord He is
trampling out the vintage where the
grapes of wrath are stored He has
loosed the fateful lightening of
His terrible swift sword His truth
is marching on Glory Glory
Hallelujah Glory Glory
Hallelujah Glory Glory
Hallelujah His truth is marching
on I have seen Him in the watch
fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded Him an altar in
the evening dews and damps
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps
His day is marching on Glory
Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory
Hallelujah Glory Glory
Hallelujah His day is marching on

Plainsboro Team Coach Lumbly Flemming Heston the others

They cut through a row to place themselves directly in front
of the Townsend Prep Team

Hal turns around to see Ginny She’s stunned to see him
there Then Ben turns They exchange a potent look

Ram whispers something in her ear Ginny doesn’t respond
she’s consumed by the sight of Ben

The GIRL FROM GLEN ROCK “E” comes up to Ben

GLEN ROCK GIRL
(whispering)
Would you sign this It’s my
favorite brief of the year It
says that abstinence leads to a
global crisis in mental health

Ben signs

GLEN ROCK GIRL (CONTD)
(To Hal) Aren’t you that Chinese
boy

HAL
Korean yes and just so you know
that’s actually pretty ignorant to
lump us all into one category

He looks back Ginny’s gone now Ram points to Hal we’re
coming for you

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - HALLWAY - DAY

Hal and Ben standing outside their first room They exchange
a meaningful look a look of resolve

Ben starts humming the Battle Hymn

Hal picks up on it

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - CLASSROOM A - DAY

Hal and Ben in the room across from the BOY AND GIRL from
NUTLEY

As Hal rises in front ready to deliver the opening speech
He looks at his opponents at the JUDGE and TIME-KEEPER at
Ben

Hal nods to the time keeper to begin and starts quietly

HAL
(speaking approximately to
the music)
You think our case will state that
sex is bound to be explored
That adding funds for abstinence is
what I will’ve roared
(MORE)

HAL (contd)
But such a case has been heard so
much that we are bored
Our plan is thus not that

Hal checks out the Judge who is jotting a note As are his
opponents He increases his volume

HAL
Our government can best support
teaching abstinence
By refraining from their common and
ugly arrogance
Instead of telling us we should
never do the dance
They should adopt this plan
Amend the constitution so that no
over twenty
Can serve in government there’11
be only kids aplenty
Well write the laws and fix sex ed
and it won’t cost a penny
That’s our basic plan

Hal starts shouting with greater fluency now He’s thrilled
and he lets himself get into it with real gusto

Hal stops singing He starts spreading

HAL
By see by what we’ll do is
increase responsibility and work
load and the sex drive will falter
We solve sex not by telling kids no
but by giving them something to do
that destroys the impulse Join
government As we’1ll argue below
In the rest of my song

Hal smiles hugely Ben too is elated

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - HALLWAY - NEXT

Coach Lumbly and a DEBATE OFFICIAL stand outside the room
watching Hal’s speech through the window built into the door

OFFICIAL
Theyve already started

COACH LUMBLY
Let’s get this over with

She opens the door

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - CLASSROOM - NEXT
They enter the room Hal in mid-speech

HAL

Now go to here’s what we’ll call
Contention 2 of our plan This
one’s harder to kind of get the
rhyme scheme because of all the
quotes that have the word
‘sexologist’ in them which doesn’t
rhyme with too much but it
basically goes like this--

It stops everyone

COACH LUMBLY
Gentlemen come with me

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - HALLWAY - NEXT

The four of them--Ben Hal Lumbly the Official--in the
otherwise empty hallway

COACH LUMBLY

BEN

boutonniere Yes sir it stirs the
pot a little

BEN
For me too Coach

COACH LUMBLY
No don’t do that

Hal senses a moment between them and jumps in to break it up

HAL
Excuse me I’m about a minute into
my opening Coach and so far so
far so far Well I’m killing
in there (Into the classroom )
Am I aren’t I killing

STATES JUDGE (0S)
I’ve heard worse

HAL
She’s heard worse

COACH LUMBLY
There was an objection raised to
your entering here today and the
New Jersey league officials have
already voted on it and it doesn’t
feel altogether great to have to
tell you this

OFFICIAL
You’re not home-schooled Mr
Hefner and that working most days
at a dry cleaners Mr Wekselbaum
means that you’re not either
You’ve been barred from the
competition

HAL
Who raised the objection

BEN
Ginny has no status to raise a
formal objection

COACH LUMBLY
I raised the objection There are
ground rules in life boys Ben
you and Ginny think you’re not
bound by them that you can do as
you please when you please I know
better It was my obligation to my
team and to you to stop all this

HAL
What about me

COACH LUMBLY
You caught me on a bad turn Maybe
let’s try again next year and we’1ll
see what we can do

EXT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - PARKING LOT - DAY

Hal and Ben walk back to his car
HAL
We might have actually won the
whole thing

BEN
Probably not if you really apply
powers of reason to it

HAL
That’s it

BEN
If I get back in time there’s an
afternoon shift at the cleaners
that’s got my name on it You can
come with me if you want
otherwise your day and your life
are hereby returned to you

Ben gets into his car

HAL

This is not the way this it’s not

the way it ends

BEN
Come visit me sometime if you want
and we’ll reminisce about this and
what it means

He drives off

Left alone Hal leaves his suitcase outside in the lot and

runs back inside

INT MONMOUTH COLLEGE - HALLWAY - DAY

Hal runs down the hallway looking into open
throwing up closed door

AT ONE DOOR--
He peers inside and rushes past
HE THROWS OPEN A SECOND DOOR--

Keeps going

He peers into a THIRD DOOR keeps going

AT THE FOURTH DOOR he comes to sliding stop
for a BEAT and then opens the door

doors and

gathers himself

HAL
Today was not my day But someday
maybe will be And on well on
that day you’ll you’1ll be alone
and you’ll think to yourself all
alone I knew him when Him being
me

He gives her the finger and starts to walk away
Ginny comes out of the classroom spreading as she does

GINNY RYERSON
(Back into the room) Anarchy is
not only the best system in which
to encourage adult maturation it is
the best system in which to teach
sexual liberation--(To Hal) While
I see that you don’t recognize this
at the moment you actually have me
to thank in part--modesty forces me
to acknowledge--but in large part
for your newfound zest of
competition and gamesmanship That
was very clever to find Ben
surprisingly clever And very
painful Which means I upped your
game little man

Without turning around Hal waves her off her gesture
returned to her

GINNY RYERSON (CONT’D)
You’re welcome (Back to the
room) Liberation breeds
liberation ie sexual freedom
inspires political freedom
According to Sandoval ‘01 “At the
heart of all liberty is the liberty
to engage in personal relations of
one’s own choosing”

She slams the door behind her as she goes back into the room

it

He tosses himself down into it then stands runs some more

hope not A A slice Justa
slice of Well you know What

serve The pizza

The Server hands over a slice of pizza like it’s nothing at
all

Hal stares at the slice for a long BEAT OF TRIUMPH

HAL (CONTD)

We look inside

Hal at a booth finishes his pizza while the Server stacks
chairs in front

NARRATOR (VO)
Eventually all of this would pass
and Hal Hefner would be left with
just the story to tell again and
again until it was hard for Hal
Hefner to remember what he was
really like back then when he
carried in his head the sound of a
made-up perfect voice A voice
that could speak its heart Until
the day Hal Hefner stopped wishing
he sounded like anyone else and
just started talking as he was

EXT MONMOUTH SEASHORE BOARDWALK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Hal waits in the empty parlor parking lot his father’s big

DOYLE
You OK

Hal and Doyle sit for a beat in silence

HAL (CONTD)
Yeah But what would you say are
your thoughts on love

DOYLE
It’s so late Hal and I couldn’t
find the off-ramp and had to circle
back three times and now I’m not
even sure I know how to get you
back to Plainsboro

HAL
I guess you know Well it’s
nothing I was just thinking

DOYLE
Maybe you shouldn’t think so much
about everything

HAL
I mean it’s not it shouldn’t be
rocket rocket it shouldn’t be
rocket It shouldn’t be that
but it feels like sometimes it
just feels you know I guess what
I just want to know when at what
point you see does all this
begin or really start to make
sense

DOYLE
All what

HAL
Everything all of it

DOYLE
I guess at some point see you
reach a certain age and you’re in
Jersey or someplace just like it
and you stop trying to figure it
all out It’s kind of like that
(MORE)

DOYLE (contd)
You just are glad for what you
have

HAL
And that happens to everybody

DOYLE
Pretty much but you let me know if
it turns out different for you

way to do that some good way to

let you know how it all turns out
