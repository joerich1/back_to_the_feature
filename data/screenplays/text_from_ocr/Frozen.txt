OPEN ON ICE

Were underwater looking up at it A saw cuts through
heading right for us

EXT SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

ICE HARVESTERS dressed in traditional Sami clothing score a
frozen lake They SING

The Frozen Heart (Ice Workers Song)

ICE HARVESTERS
BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING
THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING

The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water

ICE HARVESTERS (CONTD)
CUT THROUGH THE HEART COLD AND CLEAR
STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR

SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER
SPLIT THE ICE APART

AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART

Hup Ho Watch your step Let it go

A young Sami boy KRISTOFF and his reindeer calf SVEN
share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men

ICE HARVESTERS (CONTD)
Hup Ho Watch your step Let it go
Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
water He fails ends up soaked Sven licks his wet cheek

ICE HARVESTERS (CONTD)
BEAUTIFUL POWERFUL DANGEROUS COLD
ICE HAS A MAGIC CANT BE CONTROLLED

A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers threateningly They
fight it back

ICE HARVESTERS (CONTD)
STRONGER THAN ONE STRONGER THAN TEN
STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN

Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows

FROZEN - J Lee

ICE HARVESTERS (CONTD)
BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR

In the dark Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
block of ice out of the water

ICE HARVESTERS (CONTD)
STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR
THERES BEAUTY AND THERES DANGER HERE
SPLIT THE ICE APART
BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART

The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
pulls away

Left behind Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
dinky little sled then head off

We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
skythen move across the mountainsbeneath the
snowlineand descend upon

Elsa shoves Anna off the bed
Anna lands butt to floor sighs defeated But then she gets
an idea She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsas
eyelids
YOUNG ANNA
(mischievously)

Do you want to build a snowman

Elsas eyes both pop open She smiles

INT CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

Anna now wearing snow boots pulls Elsa by the hand
YOUNG ANNA

Elsa tries to shush her but Annas too excited

INT BALLROOM -- NIGHT
The girls sneak into the ballroom Elsa shuts the door

YOUNG ANNA
Do the magic Do the magic

Elsa laughs and waves her hands together Snowflakes suddenly
burst forth and dance between her palms forming a snowball
Elsa throws the snowball high into the air Snow bursts out
and flurries around the room Anna dances about catching
flakes in her palms and mouth

YOUNG ANNA (CONTD)
This is amazing

YOUNG ELSA
Watch this

Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
suddenly coats the floor forming a giant ice rink Anna

slides off laughing

FROZEN - J Lee

PLAY MONTAGE

-Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
together Elsa moves his stick arms around

-Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing REVEAL Elsa is actually
propelling them across the ice floor with her magic

-The girls slide down snowbanks together
-Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air

YOUNG ANNA (CONTD)
Catch me

Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna

YOUNG ELSA
Gotcha

Anna keeps jumping Elsa keeps casting magic
YOUNG ANNA
(jumping faster)

Again Again

YOUNG ELSA
(struggling to keep up)
Slow down

Elsa suddenly slips

Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head Anna tumbles
down a snowbank and lands unconscious

YOUNG ELSA (CONTD)
ANNA

Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms A streak of
Annas hair where struck turns white

YOUNG ELSA (CONTD)
MAMA PAPA

The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes

FROZEN - J Lee

The parents burst through the frozen door GASP at the sight
of the room

KING

Anna
The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms

ELSA

SLAM CUT TO

INT DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
inscribed with Old Norse runes He opens the book scrambles
to a page with an ancient map

EXT ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

Carrying the girls the King and Queen ride their horses out
of the kingdom Snow streams from Elsas hands leaving a
trail of ice behind them

EXT FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT

A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark
woods All of a sudden the King and Queen race by with the
girls leaving the wake of ice

KRISTOFF
Ice

SLAM CUT TO

FROZEN - J Lee

EXT BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT
Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice

YOUNG KRISTOFF
Faster Sven
EXT THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT

Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley They
hide behind a rock and peek out

Down below the King holds a frightened Elsa The Queen holds
the still unconscious Anna

KING
Please help My daughter

Suddenly a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
them It looks as though theyll be crushed

But luckily the rocks stop at their feet The rocks then
unfold revealing bright faces

YOUNG KRISTOFF
Trolls

The rock in front of Kristoff wakes up Meet BULDA

BULDA
Shush Im trying to listen

She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
close Sven licks her face and she eyes them both

BULDA (CONTD)
Cuties Im gonna keep you

Back below the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth
They call him GRAND PABBIE He approaches arthritically but
determined He nods respectfully to the king

GRAND PABBIE
Your Majesty
(referring to Elsa)
Born with the powers or cursed

KING
Born And theyre getting stronger

Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him She
does He examines her

FROZEN - J Lee

GRAND PABBIE
(about Anna)
You are lucky it wasnt her heart
The heart is not so easily changed
but the head can be persuaded

KING
Do what you must

GRAND PABBIE
I recommend we remove all magic
even memories of magic to be
safe But dont worry Ill
leave the fun

Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Annas
head We see her memories floating right above her Grand
Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
girls in winter gear He puts the ordinary memories back in
her head

GRAND PABBIE (CONTD)
She will be okay

YOUNG ELSA
But she wont remember I have
powers

KING

Its for the best

PABBIE
Listen to me Elsa your power will
only grow

As he speaks he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes

PABBIE (CONTD)
There is beauty in your magic
But also great danger

The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes

PABBIE (0S) (CONTD)
You must learn to control it

In the Northern Lights display the sharp spikes cause human
figures to panic and attack Elsa

PABBIE (CONTD)
Fear will be your enemy

FROZEN - J Lee

Elsa gasps and buries her face in the Kings chest The King
wraps his arms around Elsa protectively

KING
No Well protect her She can
learn to control it Im sure

Over the Kings words we

A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in
his bunad jacket

They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
chatting with his reindeer We recognize them as Kristoff and
Sven all grown up Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
nuzzles Kristoffs chest

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONTD)
Give me a snack

shoes to enhance his presence Two THUG guards follow close
behind him

DUKE
Ah Arendelle our most mysterious
trade partner Open those gates so

exploit your riches
(catching himself)

Kristoff goes flying off behind them still on the sled
Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge

Kristoffs sled loses momentum Its not going to make it He
leaps off He flaps his arms claws at the air

He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff Hanging by his
hands he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below
and burst into flames

FROZEN - J Lee

blizzard taking over the room

ELSA

Annas voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out

ELSA
I CANT

Elsas fear so strong sucks the blizzard back into her and
then it bursts out unwittingly like a sharp snowflake

Anna is STRUCK right in the heart She grasps her chest in
pain and stumbles back She falls to her knees

Elsa gasps when she sees Anna Just then Olaf and Kristoff
rush into the room to Annas side

KRISTOFF
Anna Are you okay

Anna gets to her feet determined to hide the pain

ELSA
(scared)

ELSA
(desperate)

How What power do you have to stop

creeping down the walls Puts a protective arm around Anna

KRISTOFF
Anna I think we should go

ANNA
(close to tears)

ELSA
(heartbroken but decisive)

Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant menacing snowman
Well call him MARSHMALLOW

Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their
necks in one hand and Olaf in the other

ANNA

Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps

to the ice railing
OLAF (0S)

throws it at Marshmallow

The tiny little ball hits Marshmallows back not making even
the slightest dent But its enough to infuriate him He
ROARS Spikes shoot out of his joints

KRISTOFF
Uh-oh Now you made him mad

OLAF

Kristoff pushes Anna along Sven runs off in the opposite
direction Olafs belly and butt fall and follow Sven

OLAF (CONTD)
No no not you guys

FROZEN - J Lee

Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olafs
head falls and lands face down in snow

OLAF (CONTD)
(muffled)
This just got a whole lot harder

Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope They

tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard
right behind them

Theyre off againthrough a maze of conifers that sag under
the weight of the snow Marshmallow hot on their trail

KRISTOFF
This way

Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of
the snow The tree snaps upright knocking Marshmallow back

KRISTOFF (CONTD)

(impressed)
Ho-ho-ho
ANNA

Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost
run right off a cliff They stop short toes on the edge
KRISTOFF
Whoa stop

ANNA
Its a hundred foot drop

KRISTOFF

Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight

ANNA
Ow

He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the
snow with a pick axe

ANNA (CONTD)

FROZEN - J Lee

ANNA
(not trusting)

Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her They
hang upside down over the cliff by the rope The rope catches
their fall

KRISTOFF
Whoa That happened

Back up top Olaf emerges from the woods Hes a complete
mess all his body parts are in the wrong places He huffs
and puffs struggling to run

OLAF

OLAF (CONTD)
(happily)

Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoffs snow anchor

OLAF (CONTD)
NO

Olaf jumps onto Marshmallows leg trying to stop him but not
making much of a difference

OLAF (CONTD)

This is not making much of a
difference

Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff

OLAF (CONTD)
WHOA

Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff

ANNA

OLAF

Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Annas rope up

ANNA

ANNA

FROZEN - J Lee

Marshmallow pulls them up He roars and breathes snow all
over them

MARSHMALLOW

breath)
Ugh We wont
Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope Kristoff comes to
just as they fall They both SCREAM

SLAM

REVEAL Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her
shoulders in the soft thick snow She laughs

ANNA (CONTD)
Hey you were right Just like a
pillow

She looks up to see Olafs upper half hanging onto Kristoffs
boots which are sticking out of the snow

OLAF
(shaking the boots)
I cant feel my legs I cant feel
my legs

Suddenly Kristoffs head pops up He spits out snow

KRISTOFF
Those are my legs

Olafs bottom goes running by

OLAF
(to Kristoff)
Ooh Hey do me a favor grab my

Kristoff grabs Olafs head and puts it on his body

OLAF (CONTD)

Sven walks up and sniffs Olafs nose

OLAF (CONTD)

his nose -- and misses

Elsa lifts her arms and the ground shakes and cracks The
ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air

Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws

The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves

The villagers come out to see the warmth returning

In one final wave Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant
snowflake in the sky then waves it away leaving only a warm

summer day

toward him prepared for a fight But Anna puts up a hand and

stops him
