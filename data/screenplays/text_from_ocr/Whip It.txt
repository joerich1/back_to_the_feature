INT BEAUTY PAGEANT DRESSING ROOM —- DAY

CLOSE on a giant can of hair spray A manicured finger
presses the nozzle and PSSHHT our camera lens is covered

We PUSH IN through the fog so thick we think we’re in
“Apocalypse Now” until we see

--Well OK so it’s not exactly Vietnam but it is war -

A flock of TEENAGE GIRLS fight for space in front of a
backstage mirror Welcome to the world of beauty pageants -
Texas style

In this high stakes do or die pageant prep-a-thon zits are
concealed hairis teased and lips are glossed

CORBI BOOTH 16 primping in front of a mirror oozes the
kind of jjust-add-water perfection that makes pageant judges
weak in the knees A plunging gown sets off her ample chest

AMBER YORK 16 earnest to a fault stares longingly at
Corbi’s boobs as she tries to make the most of her A-cups in
a gown that was clearly made for a girl packin’ C-cup heat

Corbi rolls her eyes

CORBI
Jesus Amber Staring at mine
aren’ t gonna make yours grow

AMBER

Sorry Corbi It’s just that your
inner light is brighter than ever

A CRETE CONTESTANT rolls her eyes
CATTY CONTESTANT
It’ S called Zoloft

corbi throws hex a ‘I hope you die’ look

WALTER 40 the chipper coordinatoremcee rushes in waving
his clipboard The man’s been in the closet so long he
smells like mothballs

Bliss is flirting with rebellion

Pash It’s not washing out

PASH AMINI 16 Bliss’ best friend a fearless Arab-American
bombshell whose look can only be described as “punk rock
meets 1950’s pin-up” is busy spying on the pageant wannabes
from the door

PASH
Dude Some girl just started
crying because she left her ‘lucky
lip gloss’ at home
(Turning back to Bliss)

And were the freaks Hilarious

A panicked Bliss stands ‘up from the sink -her wet hair is
BRIGHT BLUE

BLISS
It’s only hilarious because it’s
not happening to you

face “Jesus what would you do”

Then it’s Corbi’s turn She smiles with perfection

There is a pause Bliss slowly steps out with her blue hair
The crowd gasps in horror Brooke looks appalled

Bliss forces a smile and makes her way to the mic She takes
a breath and starts to deliver her prepared answer

BLISS
If I could have dinner with
anyone )

IN THE AUDIENCE

Brooke mouths along with Bliss’ well-rehearsed answer
Never mind the shocking blue hair Brooke wants to win

BLISS (CONTD)
-»--it would be Oprah Winfrey
because she has created something
- important and special out of being
true to herself

BACK ON STAGE

Bliss stops thinking about what she just said An epiphany
comes over her And then --

a BLISS (CONTD)
-- Although if I were really being
true to myself I’d have to say
music is the most important thing
to me

Bliss rattles on unable to censor her genuine thoughts

BLISS (CONTD)

And I’d totally freak if I got to

have dinner with Joe Strummer from

The Clash because every time I hear
London Calling it makes me feel

like it was written just for me

today not 30 years ago by some

punk dudes in England y’know

--Bliss looks up and suddenly sees a slack-jawed crowd
staring back at her

Front and center is Brooke simmering with a quiet rage
© Bliss forces a pageant smile and quickly tries to cover

BLISS (CONTD)
Uh -—- and that is why I would like
to have dinner with Oprah Winfrey

WALTER
(covering the awkwardness)
— OK thank you Bliss Cavendar
