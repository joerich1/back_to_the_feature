INT HENRYS APARTMENT VIENNA - DAY

HENRY PELHAM (mid-40s disheveled) closes a small carry-
on suitcase on a chair and locks it From a shelf he
takes and pockets an old phone

He pauses by his window to take a final look at the
expanse of Vienna the fog coming in

PRELAP CHILDREN CRYING --
He grabs his suitcase and heads out
SULEIMAN (VO)
We are Da’irat Al-Salihoon
INT FLIGHT 127 - DAY (2012 - EIGHT YEARS AGO)
CELL PHONE CAMERA SHOT CLOSE ON a swarthy thin face --

SULEIMAN WAHED Saudi He’s INTENSE EDGY but
smiling rejoicing speaking to his phone as he paces

SULEIMAN
We are here because of your
country’s arrogant foreign policy
towards our brothers in
Afghanistan Iraq Chechnya and
Somalia We are here because of
your evil alliance with the
Americans and their insistence on
continuous bombings and killings
despite our serious warnings

The plane around him looks empty but as he turns we find
NINE CHILDREN (5-12) in business-class seats Terrified

SULEIMAN
We want you to back off and leave
our people alone We are fighting
for the prestige of Islam For our
brothers and sisters mothers and
fathers

Behind him OMAR SAMATAR ALI RUSHES by on his way to
coach gripping a pistol

SULEIMAN
-For the fallen -- First General
Emir Osama Bin Laden peace be
upon him

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 1A

He turns to smile at the children Most aren’t even
looking at him Three CRY out loud The others are
paralyzed

PULL BACK to find we’re watching this on a flat-screen TV
in
INT US EMBASSY VIENNA VICKS OFFICE - MORNING

the modern clean office of CIA Station Chief VICTOR
(VICK) WALLINGER (late 40s)

Vick’s not looking at the TV -- he’s looking dead
serious at his people -- SIX CIA EMPLOYEES sitting and
standing watching in shellshocked silence

SULEIMAN (V0O)
--For those tortured by the
brothers of Satan in Egypt Jordan
and Saudi Arabia

ERNST PUL (40s) stands by the door arms crossed over
his chest staring hard

LEILA MALOOF (30s) an otherwise tough woman sits with
her hands on her knees head down WEEPING openly

BILL COMPTON (50s) a Cold War veteran rubs his temples
a headache coming on

SULEIMAN (V0O)
--For the martyrs For the
Caliphate We have broken into the
infidel’s house to save our
brothers And we will burn down
this house when our honor demands
it

In a chair OWEN LASSITER (30s) a glum-looking man
covers his mouth with a hand beneath his bleak eyes

Our two primaries stand on opposite sides of the room --
CELIA HARRISON (30s) and Henry Pelham (30s)

Celia face gloomy and eyes swollen from too little
sleep is unable to tear her gaze from the TV

Henry unlike the others doesn’t look like an office
drone because he’s not He works the street chasing
down sources

SULEIMAN (V0O)
(from television)
We are the soldiers of Islam and
this is our war on terror Allahu
Akbar

Henry looks from the TV to Celia He tries to catch her
eye but she’s transfixed painfully by the video

Then she leaves the room without a word

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA CIA STATION - CONTINUOUS

Celia walks briskly through the embassy’s CIA station a
hub of cubicles and computers and CIA EMPLOYEES at quiet
work She grabs her coat and heads straight to the
elevators

EXT US EMBASSY VIENNA - MOMENTS LATER

She exits the neoclassical building on Boltzmanngasse
almost breaking into a run as she makes her way down the
pavement away from the embassy She passes
VIENNESEheads for the next street

Henry BURSTS from the embassy running after her --
confused He spots her disappearing around the corner

HENRY
Celia

He reaches the corner then STOPS HUFFING VIENNESE
FACES but not hers The city has swallowed her

ON HENRY He looks LOST

INT UNITED AIRLINES JUMBO JET - NIGHT

Henry’s in a business class window seat -- darkness
outside the window lights low as the plane traverses
the Atlantic Around him PASSENGERS doze chin-deep in
blankets but Henry can’t sleep

A UNITED AIRLINES STEWARDESS noticing him leans close
and whispers

UNITED AIRLINES STEWARDESS
Can I get you anything

Henry shakes his head Smiles
She nods at that and as she walks away

HENRY (VO)
It’s been eight years Vick
Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 4

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA VICKS OFFICE - DAY (WEEKS AGO)

Henry in an office chair upset by what he’s just heard

HENRY
No one wants to open that can of
worms

VICK

Headquarters feels differently

HENRY
We did this already What went
wrong What could we have done
better We’ve been blaming
ourselves ever since

Vick looks at Henry for a long beat Both men pained by
the memory of that terrible past

VICK
They caught Ilyas Shishani

Henry stiffens

HENRY
What When

VICK
Afghanistan 3 weeks ago
(beat)
He said we were compromised back
then The hijackers had help from
inside our station Here in
Vienna

HENRY
(incredulous )
And we believe him

VICK
Langley believes him That’s the
only thing that matters

Henry unwilling to believe --

HENRY
Send me If anyone can get the
truth out of Ilyas --

VICK
(raises hand)
He’s dead Henry
(MORE )

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 4

VICK (CONTD)
Wasn’t in any shape to be
interrogated -- someone made a
mistake

Blue Rev (27 Nov 2020) 5

Henry’s taken aback by this

HENRY

Did they at least get a name out
of him

Vick shakes his head Henry reflects on this and what it
means

VICK
We need to close the books on
flight one twenty seven once and

for all get headquarters off
our case

(beat)
Id like you to wrap this up

HENRY
Why me

Vick sighs and opens a folder on his desk Passes over a
sheet of paper -- embassy phone logs from December 6
2012 One call at “2103” to a number beginning “9821”
is circled with marker Henry finds “EXTENSION 4952” and
“COMPTON WILLIAM” Henry furrows his brow

HENRY
That’s a Tehran number isn’t it

VICK
(nod)
And Bill wasn’t the only one to
use the extension You know that

Henry looks back at the paper takes it all in

HENRY
Okay I’ll do it

VICK
(hesitates)
And if it’s her
(off Henry)
You still holding a torch for
Celia Harrison

HENRY
It’s Celia Favreau now A husband
and two kids

INT SAFEWAY CARMEL CA - DAY (PRESENT)

We’re UP HIGH LOOKING DOWN on the frozen food section of
Carmel’s huge upscale grocery store Celia walks slowly
distracted as if there’s nothing here for her

HENRY (VO)
Besides no torch burns eight
years Not without oxygen

A YOUNG MAN with long hipster sideburns opens a freezer
This is FREDDY He speaks to her without looking at her
then drops a pint of ice cream into his basket Walks
away

VICK (VO)

You think she’1ll even talk to you
We could send Mack to California

EXT CROSSROADS SHOPPING CENTER CARMEL - CONTINUOUS
She leaves Safeway and crosses the parking lot toward
other stores It’s a genteel manicured shopping plaza
full of overpriced cars and SUVs and the aging RETIRED
HENRY (VO)

He wont be able to tell if she’s

lying
FOLLOW Celia past storefronts to a bench outside where
sits KARL STEIN Genial-looking he eats from a bag
of nuts In the background Freddy arrives carrying a
plastic bag with his ice cream He takes his place
watching over the meeting

VICK (V0O)
Will you

Karl smiles as Celia approaches

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA VICKS OFFICE - DAY (WEEKS AGO)
Henry gives Vick a pointed look

HENRY
Isn’t that why you’re sending me

Vick holds Henry’s look A silent acknowledgement

HENRY
Bill’s in London now right

10 10
VICK
Correct
HENRY
I’1l talk to him first
(beat)

Then I’1l see about California
Henry pushes the phone log back to Vick

HENRY
You almost sound like you want
someone to be guilty

VICK
What I want is to chalk up flight
one twenty seven to bad luck What
I need is to know that the man I
send can do what’s necessary

HENRY
And if this turns out to be true
what are your orders

Vick looks pained as if the weight of the world’s on his
shoulders

VICK
We can’t afford the embarrassment
of a prosecution Not these days

Henry tries to lock eyes but Vick’s evasive

HENRY
You gonna say it

Feeling as if he’s being pushed into a corner Vick
straightens and looks Henry straight in the eyes

VICK
No Henry I’m not

Off Henry --

Up ahead he spots the turn-off for Carmel-by-the-Sea on
the right He passes a golf course with a scenic view of
the ocean On the left a high school with backed-up
traffic sports cars helmed by insolent TEENS

He takes the exit for Carmel and slows down A speed-
limit SIGN “20 MPH”

More trees lush with cottages peeking through
Eventually he reaches the pretty little downtown English-
village themed Older RICH PEOPLE walking past art

Through the windows Henry watches Bill find a booth

Bill looks NERVOUS

INT LONDON PUB - MOMENTS LATER 16

Bill’s sitting at his window table clutching a pint of

Henry parks his convertible in a small lot just outside
of town He gets out and walks a narrow trail toward a
restaurant

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 11

INT VIN DE VIE - LATE AFTERNOON

He enters the sleek restaurant Modern to a fault
Origami ceiling lamps white tables and apple-green
chairs A minimalist bar of pounded iron -- no shelves
behind it -- with a BARTENDER (30s) texting

There’s one OLD COUPLE here eating slowly in silence
The beach and ocean fill the windows late afternoon
light burning shafts into the restaurant

A tall pretty WAITRESS (20s) in black approaches
smiling clutching an iPad She’s wearing her hair in a
ponytail atop her skull

WAITRESS

She watches him cross the restaurant and climb onto a
stool The Bartender sidles over He too is in black
It’s their uniform George Michael-style beard as if
it’s been painted on

HENRY
Vodka martini You got Tito’s

BARTENDER
Sorry We only have wine

HENRY
Really

The Bartender smiles and hands him a laminated pamphlet
an epic list of regional national and foreign wines

BARTENDER
Wine country you know

Henry shuts the menu

HENRY
Let’s try something very cold

BARTENDER
White or rosé

HENRY
Dry

As the Bartender crouches to search a hidden
refrigerator there’s a COUGHING HACKING Henry turns to
see the Old Couple at their table The OLD MAN is
COUGHING The OLD WOMAN eats steadily seemingly unaware
of his presence

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA BILLS OFFICE - EVENING Celia and Henry are alone he’s sitting in a chair she’s
leaning against Bill’s desk There’s something deep and
sad between them -- they’ve just come out of a heavy
conversation that’s left both of them mute

She comes over and squats in front of him Celia’s face
is full of not just sympathy for Henry’s pain whatever
it is

From outside the office someone COUGHS

HENRY
I’ve been thinking

CELIA
(warning smile)
You know how I feel about
thinking

He holds her look He wants to make sure she understands
the gravity of what he is going to ask her

CELIA is a different person than in 2012 a suburban
mother But of course she’s not only that she could
never be just that Not to Henry

CELIA
It’s been a while
HENRY
Too long
He leans in to kiss her cheeks She accepts him with her
hands on his shoulders Almost a lover’s embrace Almost
She too seems stunned by his presence When they

separate her hand’s still on his shoulder Glassy smile

looks around the mostly empty restaurant

HENRY
This is a nice spot

CELIA

Weekends with the tourists you
can’t get a table Middle of the
week it’s dependably dead

HENRY
And Carmel-by-the-Sea
(beat)
Indulging your love of the
elderly

She arches a brow

HENRY
How’s Drew

CELIA
Don’t do that

They both take a beat looking into each other’s eyes
both touching on a shared memory

HENRY
Youve really done it
(off her raised
eyebrow)
Youve left everything behind

She thinks about this serious

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 16 22

CELIA
That stuff -- Vienna the Agency
the things we did there -- that’s
not here It’s an entirely
different universe

HENRY
I’ve noticed

She smiles at him enigmatically
CELIA
And then here you are
INT HENRY’S APARTMENT VIENNA - MORNING 23
THROUGH A WINDOW we see a bright winter sky

Celia’s waking looking out the window then her gaze
DRAWS BACK to Henry dozing beside her

For a while she STARES at his features -- he’s vulnerable
now the most vulnerable he’ll ever be She feels good
looking at this man
Then he OPENS his eyes
CELIA
Hey

They kiss then she wraps herself in one of Henry’s
shirts and walks to the kitchen a little chilly and
fills a coffee pot with water Pours it into the machine
Adds grounds

INT HENRY’S APARTMENT VIENNA - MOMENTS LATER 24

She returns to the bedroom with two cups and hands him
one as he sits up using pillows to support himself

HENRY

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 18

CELIA
(shakes head)
You can do better than that

HENRY
(thinks then)
To old lovers

CELIA
Old

But she smiles approving and drinks --

Henry FOCUSES ON Celia’s sensual first sip the way she
purses her lips and moves her tongue around her mouth
spreading the wine over her buds

A GLANCE -- she SEES him noticing She seems to like it
And he of course notices this

CELIA
How’s the office

HENRY
Vick runs it like a fiefdom
Nothing changes

CELIA
You’re still on the street

HENRY
Entirely air-conditioned now

Celia looks at him surprised

Celia frowns

HENRY
Now there’s an analyst at
Headquarters who wants to ride the
lie until it bears fruit Thinks
we have some soul-searching to do

Celia thinks long and hard

CELIA
Id say we did some pretty serious
soul-searching back then

HENRY
He’s looking for inconsistencies

CELIA
History is full of
inconsistencies

Henry nods acknowledging the truth of this

HENRY
Here’s the plan Cee I write a
fat report a rococo analysis of
failures and successes Full of
perspectives Make the fucker’s

That should get him off our back

So this is an interview

HENRY
I was in Santa Clara Driving down

open hands A coy smile

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 21

Celia smiles at that

The Waitress approaches to take their orders

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 25

INT VIN DE VIE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Henry is at a urinal and SIGHS as the LOUD STREAM exits
his body

ON HIS FACE Eyes damp thinking hard
Finishes and FLUSHES

As he washes his hands he looks into the mirror Heavy
lids bloodshot eyes

Then he reaches into his pocket and takes out the phone
he used to talk to “Treble”

Starts a recording app with a meter that JUMPS as he
speaks

HENRY

Eighteen thirty-six Pacific time

Leaving the recording app running he pockets the phone

INT VIN DE VIE - MOMENTS LATER

Henry falls in behind the Waitress who’s carrying a tray
of appetizers She realizes he’s behind her and moves to
the side so he can get by

Celia watches him sit his game face on as the Waitress
delivers their appetizers

WAITRESS

with bitter leaves miso ginger
and pumpkin puree and pickled
candy beets

Fields of bacon running free

The waitress smiles

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 26

WAITRESS
It’s a beautiful sight More wine

HENRY
Please

Celia nods

Henry watches the Waitress depart He notices a new
customer at the bar an odd-looking MAN -- late 50s
heavy sandpaper scalp -- who angrily wipes at his nose
as he reads the wine menu

CELIA
Yes she’s very pretty How long
were you planning to stay

Henry’s gaze flicks away from the Man to the Waitress’s
rather beautiful legs

HENRY
(smiles)
You are the only girl in town for
me

She smiles Henry drinks in that smile

CELIA
Your bacon smells divine

He spears some burrata and bacon and holds it out She
thinks about it as if it really requires thought

HENRY
Live a little

She lives a little taking it into her mouth and once
her tongue touches the bacon her eyes close lips purse
and she sucks everything off the fork

Henry’s HYPNOTIZED

Celia nods
CELIA

You haven’t been home in a while

HENRY
Been a few years

Celia thinks for a second

CELIA
It’s not easy coming home

HENRY
But are you happy here

CELIA
I stay busy Ask anyone with kids

Henry takes that as a “no”

CELIA
People tend to misinterpret the
pursuit of happiness as the right
to be happyat least in this
part of the world

She gestures at “California” outside the restaurant

HENRY
Keeps a lot of pharmaceuticals in
business

CELIA
Just after we moved I saw the
doctor He asked me if I’d been
upset Of course I got married
(off Henry’s half-
grin)

writing on his pad Then he rips
it off and hands me a prescription
for Xanax

Of course they worked I went off
of them for both
pregnanciesworst eighteen
months of my life

HENRY
Really

CELIA
I’m exaggerating We do that here
We also use the word “love” for
things we’re only fond of
(whisper)
Welcome to California Don’t take
any of us at face-value

The Waitress appears with two wine bottles They lean
back She refills both glasses

WAITRESS
Everything to your liking

Both nod and GRUNT their pleasure

CELIA
I shouldnt keep drinking The
kids’ll probably still be up

HENRY
Can’t Drew take care of it

CELIA

thing

SINGLE SHOT We SEE each of the people she describes as
they do their work talking on phones joking reading
papers conferencing with subordinates etc These are

the faces we saw in the opening scenes

Vick walks with papers in hand

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 31

CELIA (VO)
Chief of station then as now was
Victor Wallinger He’d survived
three administrations with
excellent marks but I think his
greatest talent was knowing who to
bring on to the team

HENRY (VO)
Take me through the team

Leila laughs at someone’s joke turns and smiles at
Celia who’s entering the station and heading to her
desk

CELIA (VO)
LEILA MAROOF collection

last thirty years Scarred by old
skirmishes in Southeast Asia but
he probably suffered more at the
hands of his wife Sally

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 31A

HENRY (VO)
Probably That’s generous

As they speak Ernst exuding arrogance leans into the
doorway saying something to Bill and Celia

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 32

CELIA (VO)
The other was ERNST PUL who
worked liaison with Austrian
intelligence

HENRY (VO)
Captain Uptight

analysts Only lasted a couple of
months before he found himself a
pistol from the storeroom and
smuggled it home

PUSH IN A sad-looking Viennese living room An old comfy
chair and on the wall behind it a splash of blood and
brains In front of the chair half covered by a small
table lies Owen’s dead body
INT VIN DE VIE - EARLY EVENING (PRESENT)
Henry nods remembering

CELIA

Henry frowns curious

CELIA
Henry Pelham

Morning guests having coffee and croissants before work

CELIA (VO)
clandestine case officer

We find Henry across from a BANKER (40s) with a leather
satchel by his chair Espressos in front of them

CELIA (VO)
As the brightest talent out of the

directly to Moscow

Henry gets a phone call It’s from VICK He excuses

walks back out the restaurant

We hear
HENRY

HENRY (VO)
Okay You painted your picture

CELIA (VO)
You witnessed the Nord-Ost
siege

Henry doesn’t answer

CELIA (VO)
Chechen militants took over the
Dubrovka Theater during a
performance of the musical “Nord-
Ost” The Russians pumped gas into
the theater and went in Killed
nearly all the terrorists Well
over a hundred hostages too

INT VIN DE VIE - EVENING (PRESENT) 47
CLOSE ON HENRY She’s touching a still-raw nerve even

after two decades Henry moves his fork on the now empty
plate recovering

CELIA
That kind of thing never leaves
you does it

HENRY
Moscow was brutal but I loved my
job

Celia recognizes the truth in that

HENRY
How about you Did you like it

CELIA
The job

Henry nods

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 35

CELIA
It was a high
(beat)
We collected secretssometimes
from the top echelons of
government

HENRY
So you were happy there

CELIA
It was my dream job I knew I was
making a differenceI had a boss
I adoredand I had you

Celia looks him in the eye

HENRY
And then you left

Celia stares a beat then nods slowly

CELIA
Then flight “one twenty seven”
happened

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA VICKS OFFICE - MORNING (NOTE Continues scenes above Celia entering embassy )

Celia’s sitting in Vick’s office with the other major
players Ernst Bill Leila Owen Not Henry

CELIA (VO)
It started with a cable from

You were out in the streets

We GLIMPSE the page she’s reading a copy of a TOP SECRET

Langley

VICK

She finishes and looks up

Yellow Rev (18 Dec 2020)

CELIA
Al-Da’irat -- didn’t they split
from Al-Shabaab a couple years
ago

BILL

(mild sarcasm)
Shabaab wasn’t devout enough for
them

Celia grins at this

LEILA
(sharp)
It had nothing to do with
devotion Power That’s all it
ever is

VICK
Somali terrorists in our backyard
What’s our take

ERNST

(with confidence)
Not here Germany maybe But not
Austria

(beat)
What do they want Troops out of
Afghanistan The Austrians only
have a handful The Germans have
the third-largest presence in
NATO’s Security Force

(beat)
Maybe they want to free some
comrades from jail Again
Germany’s the one holding more
than its fair share

CELIA

Were talking EU You pick the
softest target They don’t need to
land in Frankfurt or Berlin to
speak to the Germans

Vick nods agreeing Ernst shrugs unwilling to admit

that Celia’s right

VICK
What about money

LEILA
Not with Tehran bankrolling them

Celia looks around the table

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 37 48

HENRY (VO)
Did the team consider it solid

INT VIN DE VIE - EVENING (PRESENT) 49

Celia and Henry across from each other empty plates in
front of them

CELIA
You know how it is Intelligence
comes and goes a lot of it’s just
smoke But then we got the message
from Europol about Ilyas
Shishani One of his aliases had
arrived in Barcelona two days
earlier from Tehran

A moment of silence as the waitress clears out their
empty plates from the starters

HENRY
What did you know about Ilyas at
this point

CELIA

He was a Chechen extremist You
ran him as a source in Moscow

(beat)
Then he’d joined a group in Iran
that was already working with Al-
Da’irat It wasn’t much of a leap
to wonder if Ilyas had arrived for
TRIPWIRE’s “airline-related
event”

HENRY
But you didn’t know for sure

CELIA
None of us knew anything It could
have just been bad intel But then
we were called back from lunch

GENE WILCOX (40s mustached) hands Vick a file as Vick
continues on

VICK

Owen Leila and Ernst are waiting Ernst whispering into
his phone

Vick enters with Celia and Bill still conversing

CELIA
Who’s talking to them
ERNST
No one

They issued their demands by
calling a local TV station closed
the blinds and cut off all

CELIA
That’s smart
LEILA
It’s inhuman
Bill’s rubbing his face
BILL

So much for the Arab spring

Ernst stares at an open folder in his lap then raises

his head but says nothing

BILL
What are their demands

VICK
(reading from paper)
Five prisoner releases -- two in
Austria three in Germany In
twenty-four hours

CELIA
Twenty-four Jesus

BILL
Likelihood that the Germans and
Austrians will give in

VICK
We’re still waiting to hear from
Merkel’s people but the
assessment is that she’ll fold
The Austrians are a different
story The right’s been beating
Fischer for being weak on
immigration and this will play
into their hands

Pink Rev (30 Nov 2020)

BILL
Which means we don’t know
(scornful)
Politicians

LEILA
What we do know is that Ilyas
Shishani is in Europe and may be
coordinating this

VICK
Henry’s sniffing leads as we
speak

CELIA

The Austrians are in the loop

ERNST
They will be

A moment of silence Vick goes into delegation mode

VICK
Let’s shake up our networks Bill

it’s time to pull in favors with
the Austrians Owen Talk to our
geeks in the Middle East Comb
through the chatter Tell us who
were dealing with and what
they’re planning next And

kidnap their relatives Turn the
fucking tables

INT ARAB CAFE VIENNA - DAY

Were in a dark claustrophobic tea house and ina

corner Henry is talking to QAMAR AYAD a source We can
tell from Henry’s face that he’s feeling the pressure of
the clock He’s impatient They speak in Austrian German

QAMAR
I told you I don’t know anything
about it

Pink Rev (30 Nov 2020) 40A

HENRY
Never said you did I just want to
find out what the community’s
thinking right now

Qamar looks around uncomfortable

Yellow Rev (18 Dec 2020)

QAMAR
We tell people until we’re blue
that Islam is a religion of
peacethen something like this
happens We’re back to square one

HENRY
Conversation at the mosque

QAMAR
You want to hear that people are
taking sides Of course they are
But mostly they’re afraid

EXT ARAB CAFE VIENNA - MOMENTS LATER

Henry leaves the cafe irritation all over his

Henry is with a another source of Somali descent Yasir

YASIR

So Al-Da’irat is talking to people
here in Vienna

YASIR
(Austrian German)
Directly I don’t know But some
people think they are an
inspiration
HENRY
(Austrian German)
Can you give me names

YASIR looks at Henry of course he can’t

Yellow Rev (18 Dec 2020) 41A

Henry is frustrated He takes an envelope of money from
his jacket and offers it to Yasir He accepts but shakes
his head

It’s too dangerous

Henry is getting nowhere

Henry’s sitting in his car and in the passenger seat
another source female this time TAHAR Both look out
over the dark basement

HENRY
(Austrian German)
Your family is connected What are
they saying Is there another cell
operating right now Can we expect
more hijackings What are their
capabilities

TAHAR
(Austrian German)
I don’t have the answers you’re
looking for

Henry takes out a photo of Ilyas Shishani

HENRY
(Austrian German)
His name is Ilyas Shishani

TAHAR
(Austrian German)
I don’t know this man

We think he might be here in

HENRY
(Austrian German)
Is there anyone else I can talk
to

TAHAR
(Austrian German)
I’m sorry

Henry sighs Tahar gets out of the car as Henry gets a
text He looks down frowns Doesn’t know who sent it
Then he drives off

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA CIA STATION - DAY 56

Looking defeated Henry steps out of the elevator into
the station Vick bent over a cubicle conferring with
CIA EMPLOYEES notices him and comes over

VICK
What’s the word

HENRY
I’m getting nothing They’re
slamming doors shut in my face

VICK
Any leads on Ilyas Shishani

HENRY

Either they don’t know or they’re
not telling me

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 43

VICK
Maybe we should ask the Austrians
to break down some doors

HENRY
We gotta do something

Vick heads back to his office but Henry stays by the
elevator looking at a TV on the station wall Flight 127
sitting on the tarmac

His roaming eyes find Celia working at her desk in the
bullpen head down

As if sensing him she raises her head to see him weave
around desks toward her She smiles wearily

Reaching her desk his impulse is to kiss her and she
feels the same But they’re exposed to the rest of the
station

CELIA
How are you

HENRY
Better now

CELIA
Any luck

HENRY

I’ve talked to eight people in the
last three hours No one’s telling
me anything

CELIA
They don’t know who to trust

HENRY
People seem scared Even my
regulars aren’t talking

Celia acknowledges this

CELIA
I’m in touch with the Muslim
Women’s Foundation downtown I’1l1
see where that leads

Henry smiles at her leans in

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 43A

HENRY
(whispers )

How do you manage to stay so

pretty when the world’s falling

apart
They look up and see Bill approaching from his office
Excited He waves for them to follow him to the SCIF
room gestures at Owen too while we see Ernst and Leila
making their way through the office as well

BILL
We have contact with the plane

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA SCIF - MOMENTS LATER

It’s the same crew Ernst Leila Owen Bill and Celia
enter the SCIF room Now though Henry is with them

Pink Rev (30 Nov 2020) 44

They know something serious is up because they’ve been
called to the SCIF -- a soundproof secure room with a
single monitor on the wall playing muted Austrian news

Vick enters closes the door behind him and starts
distributing files

VICK
Ten minutes ago Headquarters got a
message on the emergency line from
AHMED NAJJAR one of our Middle
Eastern couriers He’s on the

plane

Everyone’s stunned by this incredible coincidence Leila
hands out manila folders with Ahmed’s file

CELIA
We have an agent on Flight one-
twenty-seven

VICK

He’s one of the passengers
ERNST

Weve verified his identity
VICK

Headquarters did the vetting

(beat)
He sent this message “Four
attackers two guns Children in
first class Rest in econ -
Muslims starboard rest opposite
Am with Muslims aft Two women
critical No power equals no
cameras Suggest rear-
undercarriage attack”

Everyone’s still processing this unexpected turn of luck

OWEN
Id say we have the upper hand

CELIA

(reading the file)
Don’t be too sure For the last
six years Ahmed hasn’t done more
than spike dead drops He’s fifty-
eight working the clock to
retirement and he’s not trained
in any counterinsurgency

Yellow Rev (18 Dec 2020) 44a
57 57

ERNST
It’s too dangerous to storm the
plane We have to negotiate

Henry raises an eyebrow This is not normally his place
to speak but he does it

HENRY

Negotiate Have you read Al-
Da’irat’s manifesto

Yellow Rev (18 Dec 2020) 45
57 57

Uncomfortable silence -- no one has read their manifesto -
except of course Leila

LEILA
I have March 2006 Lays out
everything they will and will not
do They will never accept
anything less than their demands

HENRY
Never They will kill themselves
before negotiating They did that
in Kinshasa Remember Burned
everyone alive inside the central
police station including
themselves These guys do what
they say and they never go back
on their word

VICK
Almost sounds like you admire
them Henry

HENRY
(shrugs defiant)
They don’t suffer from ambiguity
I sometimes wish we could say that
about ourselves

Brief silence

BILL
(to Vick)
What did the Germans say

VICK
That they’1l ship their prisoners
to Vienna as a show of goodwill
but Merkel won’t let them go
Thinks it’s political suicide

BILL
(to Ernst)
And the Austrians

ERNST
(apologetic)
They are gonna play tough
Particularly now that the Germans
aren’t bending

Silence as all absorb this information

Yellow Rev (18 Dec 2020) 45A

OWEN
So if the Germans and Austrians
don’t want to bow to the demands
our only option is to storm the
plane

BILL
We’re not storming anything This
isn’t American soil All we can do
is sit back and advise the
Austrians Hope that they’1ll get
their fucking act together

OWEN
(looks at Vick)
How do we advise to the Austrians
that this be accomplished

VICK
(to Leila)
What do you think

LEILA
If we don’t get inside that plane
in the next 20 hours it’s going
to be a bloodbath

VICK
Henry you have field experience
with these people What’s your
take on this

HENRY
The undercarriage Just like Ahmed
suggested It’s been done before
Some passengers will be killed
but that’s better than all of them
dying

Everyone is trying to come to terms with the bleakness of
the situation

CELIA
Youre forgetting something

Everyone looks at her

CELIA
(nods at TV screen)
They didn’t call the media on a
lark -- they wanted eyes on the
outside of the plane

Yellow Rev (18 Dec 2020)
57 HENRY
So the Austrians will cordon them
off Get the broadcasters to play
a loop

45B

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 46

CELIA

(shakes head)
The major broadcasters might play
along but that plane’s sitting at
the end of a runway surrounded by
open field Someone with a
telephoto lens is probably live-
streaming on YouTube right now We
have no idea what they’re watching
in there

A beat as everyone realizes that she is right

Celia checks the wall clock She gets to her feet

CELIA
I’m terribly sorry I’ve got an
important meet

Vick’s question is on his face

CELIA
Muslim Women’s Association maybe
there’s a lead

VICK
(to everyone)
Let’s keep this quiet I don’t
want anyone knowing about our
friend Ahmed
(re busy bullpen)
Not even our people out there

Everyone nods

INT VIN DE VIE EVENING

A moment of silence as the Waitress arrives with more
wine Celia leans back watching Henry reflecting

The old couple having paid their cheque is getting up to

leave The
notice

man coughs again The woman seems to not even

HENRY
Why here
(off Celia)
Carmel I’m guessing you could
have moved anywhere

CELIA
Good schools

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 460A

Henry frowns not buying this

HENRY
Drew’s idea
CELIA
It was as far from the Agency as I
could get
Henry nods -- this is a reason he can understand

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 47 58

HENRY
You got out clean

CELIA
No one got out clean after one
twenty seven

Henry recognizes that his comment was insensitive

HENRY
No You’re right

Celia looks at him a moment then decides to tell him
something

CELIA
Two weeks after arriving here I
get a visit from a guy named Karl
With a K Actually it was at this
restaurant

INT VIN DE VIE - DAY 59

Same restaurant but FULL OF PEOPLE and WAIT STAFF Note
that the staff are all different from tonight’s crew

Celia’s with a genial-looking older man KARL STEIN who’s talking with quiet intensity Celia looks ANGRY

CELIA (V0O)
He tells me that Billmy Bill
the one I’ve devoted a chunk of my
life to has been selling secrets
to the highest bidder Not to
France not to China or Russia
but to the Islamist extremists

Celia gets up to leave Karl rises too

CELIA (VO)
Karl wants me to help bring him
down He wants me to fly to Vienna
and entrap him One-twenty-seven
he tells me is still very fresh
for the Austrians and they’re
demanding answers

Karl writes on a business card and hands it over Just a
phone number and he’s written “KARL STEIN” above it

Henry blinks -- this is news to him
HENRY

Any evidence
Celia shakes her head

CELIA
They were looking for a scapegoat

HENRY
What did you do

CELIA
I told him to go fuck himself

Henry nods in approval She takes a beat

CELIA
My point though is that Karl
ruined me After his visit I
started feeling like a ghost
and the nightmares That’s when
I saw the doctor

HENRY
You seem better now

CELIA
Evan cured me When I had him my
life wasn’t just about me anymore

HENRY
Maybe I should have a kid

CELIA
It’s not for the faint of heart

HENRY
You think I’m too selfish

CELIA
Definitely

Henry doesn’t quite know what to make of this
HENRY
I remember you left the station to

meet someonefrom the Muslim
Women’s Foundation

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 49
60

CELIA
It turned out to be useless

HENRY
Who did you meet

CELIA
One of my regular contacts
Sabina She couldn’t stay though -
- because of the hijacking they
were deluged by women scared that
Austrian boys would attack them on
the street But Sabina had brought
a friend -- TAHAR

CLOSE ON HENRY He’s there He needs to know

HENRY
Go on

CELIA
It was a bust Really Amateur
hour This woman Tahar said she
could introduce me to someone who
could answer my questions

EXT VIENNA STREET 2 - DUSK 61

Celia’s following a small hijabed woman -- TAHAR (NOTE
THIS IS THE SAME WOMAN THAT HENRY TALKED TO PREVIOUSLY IN

They’re in a poor immigrant neighborhood nothing like
the pristine tourist center of Vienna

They stop in front of a run-down building Tahar talks to
her serious holding out her hand

CELIA (VO)
She insisted I give her my phone
because whoever we were meeting

it’s pass-code locked

I should’ve taken that as a
warning But I was cocky back

Celia hands over the phone Tahar pockets it and leads
her inside

INT RUN-DOWN BUILDING VIENNA - CONTINUOUS

Dark lit by a weak bulb up on the second floor They
climb narrow stairs to reach a soiled door

Tahar pauses at the door KNOCKS Distantly a MUMBLE
She opens the door and they enter a dilapidated water-
damaged room A single chair and small card table sit in
the center On the table cigarettes and a half-full
ashtray Tahar closes the door

TAHAR
(in German)
Wait
Celia doesn’t like this She checks the exits -- a high

window door to the stairwell and a cracked door leading
to another room

She sits

Tahar disappears through the cracked door which CREAKS
We focus on Celia waiting listening

- MUTED CONVERSATION from the other room man and woman

- BEGINNING OF A CELL PHONE HUM that’s cut short (This
is Celia’s phone but neither she nor we can be sure of
it)

-— MURMUR OF MALE VOICE
The door CREAKS and large tough-looking MOHAMMED
DUDAYEV steps through He’s dressed casually -- jeans

sweater beard Head shaved bald His voice is THICK WITH
ACCENT (Chechen)

MOHAMMED
Celia Harrison As-salamu alaykum
CELIA
Who are you
MOHAMMED
(Pause)
Can I offer you some tea A
cigarette
CELIA

I don’t have time

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021)

MOHAMMED
I see

He walks casually around her Not threatening just

wandering

She turns her head to keep track of

CELIA
I was told you had information
About Flight one-twenty-seven

MOHAMMED
(Pause)
What we need to settle first is
the question of compensation

CELIA
Youre asking to be paid

MOHAMMED
We need power Power comes from
money If a man cannot get money-
power then he will reach for
violent power You agree

CELIA
Do you have any information or
not

MOHAMMED
(mock surprise)
You do not trust me

CELIA
That depends

MOHAMMED
As a representative of the least
trusted nation on Earth you
should recognize sincerity when it
stands before you

Celia blinks not sure what to make of this

CELIA
I meant no offence

him

Celia hesitates finally recognizing how vulnerable she

is

The door CREAKS again Mohammed looks up to see Tahar
standing there just looking at him

MOHAMMED
(to Celia)
Moment please

He heads into the other room while Tahar remains in the
doorway silent watching Celia

Then Mohammed returns shaking his head holding Celia’s
phone He’s removed the battery and hands both parts
over
MOHAMMED
You are right -- do not trust me
You can find your way out

Unsure she nods then stands pocketing the pieces of
phone

He opens the door for her

MOHAMMED
Go then As-salamu alaykum

Celia looks at him then at the impenetrable Tahar and
leaves She RUSHES down the stairs

more than it means to her

by her experience with Mohammed Dudayev

She heads toward her desk but before she reaches it
she’s blindsided by Henry All decorum gone he embraces
her and kisses her fully on the lips Passionate

A few CIA EMPLOYEES look up from their desks grinning

embarrassed)

Are you alright

He looks closely as if examining her for damage Relief
swells in him

deeply But not about them

Look it means something or it
doesn’t

Ilyas was your source in Moscow
You wanna tell us what happened I
heard you got transferred out back

He’d escaped Grozny in the
nineties and eventually put
together his own shop in Moscow

Were in the office of Moscow’s STATION CHIEF -- their
Vick He’s an efficient little bureaucrat talking calmly
from behind his desk Rationally Patiently Explaining
how the world works

HENRY (VO)
Putin had dressed up the Nord-Ost
siege as the Russian 911
Extremism wasn’t only our problem
anymore And that’s when they told
us they had compelling evidence of
an imminent attack on our embassy
in Tblisi But they wouldn’t give
it to us without a trade-off My
c0S walked me through it -- the
brass wasn’t happy but giving up
a source was our only play They
landed on Ilyas -- low level
enough not to be damaging

Henry standing takes the news badly This feels very
wrong

We’re wasting our time We need to
get inside that plane or give them
what they want

Bill gets up to leave and heads for the door

don’t want them to lose their

with the politics of the situation

There’s a process Let me find out
where the fucking politicians are

He leaves

Celia and Henry are left alone Henry’s story still
reverberating in the room

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 56A

HENRY
None of this matters

Celia’s question is on her face

HENRY

A hundred and twenty people on a
plane A hundred and thirty-one in
a theater They’re people and
people have intrinsic value but
to us to you and me they have to
stay numbers It’s the only way we
survive

face is full of appreciation for the pain Henry must have
gone through

You know how I feel about
thinking

He holds her look He wants to make sure she understands
the gravity of what he is going to ask her

HENRY
Move in with me

Celia’s a little stunned Then she leans closer smiling
HENRY
I know what kind of people we are
We hold off We’re careful We
wall ourselves off But I can’t
lose this I won’t lose this

asked her hand in marriage

from Ahmedand it’s not
upbeat

(reads from computer

“Cancel the attack plan They have
a camera on the undercarriage I
do not know how but it is clear
they know what they are doing
Very serious I suggest we give
them what they are asking for or
everyone will end up dead”

Henry wipes his mouth He looks a little off

CELIA
How did they get a camera on the
outside of the plane

OWEN
They could have done it in
Istanbul All it takes is a
baggage loader to attach it to the
hull

LEILA
I’ve been suspicious about Atatiirk
Airport for a while

BILL
Has anyone seen this camera The
Austrians have had eyes on the

plane all day long -- and no one
noticed anything out of the
ordinary

ERNST

Just because we don’t see it
doesn’t mean it’s not there

CELIA
Have we shared this last message
with the Austrians

Ernst shakes his head ashamed There’s a noticeable
hesitation in the room

VICK
The Austrians don’t know about
Ahmed Were trying to keep it
quiet

Pink Rev (30 Nov 2020)

The SURPRISE is etched into Celia’s face

CELIA

There’s an airplane full of people
whose lives are at risk on that
runwayand we haven’t told the
Austrians about Ahmed Maybe it’s
time to start sharing if we want
to get anyone out of that plane
alive

VICK
It’s Headquarters’ call They’re
not sure we can trust the Interior
Ministry

Celia glares at Vick then at Ernst who’s chewing the
inside of his cheek They all know that this is pure
idiocy and there’s no time for idiocy

CELIA
Ernst

ERNST
You know how it is We didn’t vet
the Austrians

In the silence Henry crosses to the door and exits
Celia watches him go

Celia is right We have to start
sharing our intel We’ve taken
this as far as we can on our own

as Celia takes a bite of her fish

He tastes Approves

He pops the beef in his mouth He’s going to say
something but then the Waitress returns with the bottle
of Henry’s wine He leans back and smiles at her but she
won’t meet his gaze staring only at his glass

Despite her focus the wine GLUG-GLUGS spilling a few

drops on the tablecloth She colors -- seemingly
horrified

glances back at her making a face

Celia looks as if she wants to say something but then
she pauses for a second changing the subject

I remember Bill left the office
that evening shortly after we got
Ahmed’s third message Do you know
why

As he speaks with her he puts a comforting hand on her
shoulder -- he’s asking how she’s holding up giving her
words of support But we HEAR

Sally had come down with one of
her passive-aggressive illnesses

HENRY (VO)
Sally was always his perfect
excuse

FOLLOW Bill He nods to CIA EMPLOYEES on his way to the

work Ernst and Leila were talking
to their contacts Vick was
briefing Washington --

She passes mustached Gene Wilcox who’s going through

scouring media coverage for
anything that might help

He gives her a lascivious glance as she balancing her
coffee opens the door to Bill’s office and enters

CELIA
There was a weird disconnect
remember

I was out trying to get a lead on

Celia takes that in
CELIA
I’ve sometimes wondered if he

chose Vienna because of you

HENRY
Why would he do that

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 66

CELIA
I don’t know To goad you To try
and get your help Maybe to give
himself up to you

Henry grins

HENRY
I don’t think he chose Vienna out
of a personal vendetta

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA BILLS OFFICE - NIGHT

Celia sets down her mug and drops the files onto Bill’s
desk then settles into his comfy chair

She arranges files on the large empty desktop
SIGHING she opens and begins to read
We SEE

- A file on ILYAS SHISHANI -- with pictures of daughter
ASET (age 6) and wife ELMIRA - a file on AHMED NAJJAR courier

- and print-outs of the TWO TEXT MESSAGES from Ahmed
Celia looks at Aset Shishani -- notes an entry under her
picture “DECEASED -- February 2004 -- Haemophilia” She
sighs then puts the file away

FOCUS ON THE MESSAGES FROM AHMED We READ them with her
In fact we HEAR HER READING ALOUD but in a WHISPER and
only FRAGMENTS

“4 attackers 2 guns Children in lst cl Rest in econ -
Muslims starboard rest opposite Am with Muslims aft

2 women critical No powerno cameras Suggest rear

“Lead hijacker on phone Speaks Russian Don’t know to

know what they are doing Very serious I suggest we give
them what they are asking for or everyone will end up

Goes through the notes again With her finger touches
fragments

“don’t”

Then “do not”

“No powerno cameras”

Then “I suggest we give them what they are asking
for”

Something very wrong

BILL
Of course we noticed the
difference between Ahmed’s second
message and the first one
Complete sentences As if he
suddenly had all the time in the
world for good grammar We all
noticed -- we just knew better
than to say it aloud

HENRY
No one did anything

Pink Rev (30 Nov 2020) 68

BILL
Before I left that night Vick
called me in to discuss the
elephant in the room

HENRY
Just you

BILL

Yes We had to deal with the
possibility that it wasn’t Ahmed
talking to us anymore And if he’d
been discovered who blew his
cover We’d kept his identity
under lock and key Not even the
Austrians knew he was in there

(beat)
Of course there was the
possibility that we were wrong
Maybe this was Ahmed alive and
well and he’d just decided to
waste a lot of time with articles
and prepositions Or maybe it
wasn’t Ahmed but he’d simply
given himself away -- stupidity
and bad luck run international
affairs as much as anything else

(beat)
We didn’t know anything not
really We were clutching at
straws

HENRY
Did you discuss this with Celia

Bill shakes his head

Bill grows

BILL
She had to be considered a
suspect Everyone was I’m not
sure why Vick decided to trust me -
- Maybe he was trying to gauge my
reaction Maybe he wanted to see
what I was going to do next For
all I know he sat down with others
for the same conversation

HENRY
Afterward when Headquarters sent
those guys from the counter
espionage group how did you
explain all of it to them

started shouting about a mole it
would’ve been the end of all of

you wouldn’t have done the same

82 INT VIN DE VIE - EVENING (PRESENT)

Henry leans in close as if he is onto something
important

CELIA
There was an anomoly Ahmed told
us the layout of the hostages and
suggested an attack plan Then
suddenly his tone changed He was
telling us to cooperate

HENRY
Maybe he realized his attack plan
wasn’t going to work

CELIA
But it wasn’t just that Why did
he suddenly sound like a different
person

A long pause as they both refuse to answer the question
Celia sips her wine and watches him coolly

HENRY
Youre saying he was discovered
earlier than we thought

CELIA
It’s obvious

82

HENRY
Is it

Again silence She stares him down

HENRY
Did you suspect that someone in
our station had betrayed Ahmed

CELIA
Well the Austrians couldn’t have -
- they didn’t know he existed

Beat

HENRY
Is this why you asked for the
phone logs

Celia tilts her head slight surprise but she holds
Henry’s look for a beat knows where this is coming from

CELIA
You talked to Gene
(acidic)
How is he these days

HENRY
Making a fortune with military
contractors in Dallas

CELIA
Good for him

HENRY
So it seemed reasonable to you
that this traitor would use an
embassy phone to call the
terrorists and blow Ahmed’s cover

CELIA
Intuition isn’t always reasonable

Seen through Suleiman’s Camera (Beslan is holding it)

Sleiman’s got a good grip on Ahmed’s shirt while
pointing his pistol right into the side of Ahmed’s face
There’s a bruise on Ahmed’s right cheekbone from where he
has probably been pistol whipped

Suleiman talks directly to the camera
SULEIMAN
You have not listened to our

When he points the camera back up we see that Suleiman
has marched Ahmed into the latch pointing his gun to the
back of his head

Then he shoots and Ahmed drops from the plane like a

INT US EMBASSY VIENNA CIA STATION - NIGHT The elevator doors OPEN and Celia walks in stunned by
the call she just made Her hair’s damp

Gene Wilcox looks at her over the rim of his computer

GENE
Did you see it

CELIA
See what

He motions her over with a concerned look and shows her
his computer It’s a video from ORF the German news
channel Flight 127 sitting on the runway lit up by
spotlights

GENE
They killed a passenger

In the side of the plane we SEE movement a dark hole
appears The hatch opens

A FIGURE hazy and unclear but male is PUSHED INTO the
open doorway by one of the terrorists

He stands there terrified then POP

He’s shot in the back of the head His body tumbles out
The CAMERA JERKS DOWN to find the corpse crumpled on the
tarmac Then it MOVES UP to where Suleiman stands

shouting out at the camera

SULEIMAN
TAKE AWAY YOUR SPY

He PULLS the hatch SHUT

ON CELIA She’s about to BREAK

INT VIN DE VIE - NIGHT (PRESENT)
Henry and Celia locked into the memory of Ahmed’s death

Henry takes a sip of his wine Celia looks at him with a
sad expression while A NEW WAITER dressed in black
arrives with two bottles of wine -- a young man with
hipster sideburns named FREDDY (Eagle-eyed viewers may
recognise him from outside the UPS STORE)

As he refills their glasses

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021)

HENRY
Is the waitress alright

FREDDY
Sir

HENRY
She seemedI don’t know
Distraught

FREDDY

Oh she’s fine Actually
(lowers voice)

--she’s two months pregnant

Morning sickness all day long

Shes heading home early But I’1l

take care of you from here

HENRY
Wish her well then

FREDDY
I’1l do that

Freddy withdraws and Henry and Celia watch each other in

silence a moment

CELIA
Why don’t you pin it on Owen
Lassiter
(beat)

He killed himself after all

Three months later No one ever

explained it not really
(MORE )

CELIA (CONTD)
There was a love affair gone bad
but it went bad after One-twenty-
seven
(beat)
Guilt destroys his relationship
then guilt and loneliness destroy
him It’s a perfect little
narrative and he’s not around to
defend himself

Henry nods -- this isn’t a new idea

HENRY
His uncle sits on the Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs
Committee I’1l need more than a
perfect little narrative to make
that stick

CELIA
How about Ernst

HENRY
(reDeputy Director
for Operations)
Ernst is advising the DDO Beyond
my reach

Celia smiles a small sad smile

CELIA
There’s an easier patsy

They share a look

CELIA
She was a regular at the mosque

Henry smirks
HENRY
Leila’s a White House liaison --

harder to get at than Ernst

CELIA
She cried so much at the end

Remember I think it was harder on

her than anyone else

Both reflect on Leila’s tears a moment -

CELIA

dying quickly in the corridor Suleiman crouches beside
her

CELIA (VO)

Hijacker BESLAN ABDULAYEV (Chechen) rangy and wild

appears by Celia pointing a gun at her demanding the
children

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 77

CELIA (VO)
I sit there I grasp at the
hope that if I do what they say
everything will turn out all
right

Ginny’s RIGID with fear Evan shakes his head no

Celia nods at Abdulayev She unbuckles their belts She
tells Ginny and Evan to go with him

Abdulayev leans down to grab Ginny She’s crying as he
pulls her into the aisle Celia eyes wet looks at Evan -
- somberly he follows Ginny

CELIA (VO)
I’m too scared to do anything
I just cling on to that hope

The kids stand in the aisle their backs to Celia Behind
them Abdulayev looks back at Celia smiling raising his
pistol to the backs of their heads

No She tries to launch at him but --

ANGLE ON Her seatbelt -- she’s trying to undo it to get
out to reach them But there’s no buckle to unlatch

INT VIN DE VIE - NIGHT

small and deflated

HENRY

about that night

moment tears in her eyes frozen in her tracks

HENRY
(confused)
What is it

She can’t say it any of it He takes her head in his
hands looks in her eyes questioning But she can’t take
gentleness now and she attacks him trying to consume
him with her kiss to be consumed

They stumble deeper into his bachelor pad pulling at
each other’s clothes passion growing desperately
kissing as if they can’t get enough

INT HENRY’S APARTMENT VIENNA - MOMENTS LATER 94

They’re in bed naked fucking

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 79

Celia’s out of it hardly there trying to screw the
suspicion out of her head Her boss’s phone was used to
call a terrorist and maybe by calling the same number
herself she got Ahmed killed
(NOTE We pick up Scene 21 here)
CLOSER we SEE that she’s crying Henry sees this too
and begins to pull away but she pulls him in again He
cradles her as they’re making love

The next morning you left me
INT VIN DE VIE - NIGHT (PRESENT)
Henry looks at Celia She’s saddened by the memory

CELIA
I got scared

Henry takes her in This woman he’s dreamed about ever
since she walked out of his life

HENRY
I was scared too

He waits looking for a reflection of his feelingsbut
finds only sadness in her

HENRY

We were real weren’t we
CELIA

I thought so
HENRY

Why did you run
She looks at him A deep sadness in her eyes
CELIA
I think I preferred this being an
interrogation

Henry can’t hide his disappointment

Celia shakes her head slowly

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 80

CELIA
What have you been doing Henry
for these past eight years while
the rest of us have been trying to
go on living our lives

Henry withdraws in his seat feeling her rejection

HENRY
Well you’ve convinced me
CELIA
About what
HENRY

That you are very convincing
Henry starts rubbing his temples He let’s out a small
COUGH He is not feeling well Too distraught by the
whole thing He needs a break It’s not heading in the
direction he’d hoped

CELIA

He gets up maybe a little too fast Swoons Pats the air

HENRY

Treble shuts off the faucet

You suspected Ahmed had been
betrayed You found a suspicious
phone call Why didn’t you tell

Do you really have to ask that
question
HENRY
Yes I do

Two people had access to Bill’s
phone

moment of truth

She holds his eyes A deep defiant sadness in her look

CELIA
You know what I thought when I
found it in the logs I thought
Bill had been selling us out I
didn’t understand why or how he’d
ended up roped into this mess
Then Ahmed was killed and I ran --
straight to you

CELIA
We both know that Bill didn’t make
that call

think it makes a difference

out

But for a couple seconds the display remains lit It
says

“MISSED CALL 9821”

Tears streak down Celia’s cheeks

Outside KARL approaches the restaurant’s front door with
a set of keys He NOISILY UNLOCKS the door but doesn’t
come in

HENRY
Who is that

CELIA
It doesn’t matter

Henry has already put it together

HENRY
Karl with a K

He looks down at the blood

Freddy stands near the entrance to the kitchen observing
them Bartender and Waitress are long gone

Again Henry looks over to Freddy by the kitchen door
Then he turns back to her a smear of blood on his upper
lip

CELIA
Henry listen to me They’1ll say
it was suicide
(beat)
You don’t have much longer

Tears streak down Celia’s cheeks Henry’s face is a mess
of conflicting emotions

He drops back into his chair Closes eyes Opens them
Trying to focus

Goldenrod Rev (15 Jan 2021) 102

She looks at him covering her mouth with her hands
barely holding it together

HENRY
Don’t go

She reaches out to hold his hand Shaking with tears

CELIA
They already had your name Henry
Ilyas told them I was just
confirmation

He lets out a shivering exhale Shakes his head

HENRY
I really thought I had a chance

He smiles an ironic smile to himself

HENRY
That maybe we had a chance

Celia doesn’t know what to do She still holds onto him
tenderly There’s nothing she can say

HENRY
All these yearsRunning toward
youI’m so tired

He looks around the dark restaurant then again at her A

kind of peace has come upon him

HENRY
It’s okay

He looks at her with wet eyes A long beat Closes his
eyes opens them Nods

HENRY
It’s okay You should go

Celis is nailed to the chair unable to move

HENRY
You have to go now

Slowly she stands steadying herself with a hand on the
table Then she turns and leaves

Green Rev (08 Jan 2021) 102A

EXT VIN DE VIE - CONTINUOUS 121
As she gets out the door she takes a couple steps until

her legs start to give out Steadying herself against the
wall she convulses

In the darkness we hear WAVES CRASH against the beach

She stands like that for a moment until she realizes Karl
is standing next to her

He offers her a supporting arm but she shies away

CELIA
Don’t touch me

Karl understanding withdraws

Celia turns and walks away

In the background through the windows of the restaurant
Henry is still sitting there

INT VIN DE VIE - NIGHT

Henry closes his red-veined eyes and opens them again He
tries to get Freddy in focus who either sickened or
bored goes into the kitchen and leaves him to die Henry

TWITCHES -- a small spasm

With his bloodstained hand he places his secret phone on
the table It’s STILL RECORDING

He WHEEZES as breathing becomes more difficult
SOUND PHONE VIBRATING

He opens his eyes and sees the phone trembling on the
tabletop Picks it up Puts it to his ear
