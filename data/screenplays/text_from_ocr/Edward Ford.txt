CUT

EDWARD FORD
THE EARLY SIXTIES
EXT A MOVIE THEATRE - LOS ANGELES - EVENING

The marquee says in flaked black letters BIG TRIPLE F TURf
The sky is still light Edward Ford waits for the man in
front of him to purchase his ticket then steps forward to
put down his own money

INT MOVIE THEATRE —- NIGHT

What was once a grand old theatre is now a shit pile The
audience is comprised mostly of sleeping bums though a few
are still awake Smoke drifts up into the foul air froma
number of cigarettes their lit tips glowing here and there
like stars in the dark On the screen a bad print of a Wild
Bill Elliot western is being shown Edward Ford is sitting in
a seat He looks just about the same his hair is simply a
little darker and slightly more plentiful On the screen an
actor makes his entrance Edward Ford takes a small notebook
and ballpoint pen from his shirt pocket and writes the
actors name down An altercation begins between two bums
somewhere at the back Edward Ford keeps watching the movie
A bottle rolls past him down the aisle

A LITTLE LATER

The western ends Edward Ford watches with interest nodding
to himself unconsciously and almost imperceptibly A curtain
closes over the screen squeakily and jerkily The theatre
gets a tiny bit less dim Edward Ford leaves his seat to go
to the Mens Room The Mens Room is located down at the
front so he has to walk all the way down the aisle and
across the theatre under the screen to get to it The other
members of the audience make catcalls at him and one or two
cigarette butts sail in his direction Edward Ford pushes
open the door he needs to go through

INT DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A man more prone to changing the expression on his face than
Edward Ford would probably be demonstrating some form of
distaste at this point but the fact that this corridor has
undoubtedly been taken for the Mens Room by patrons
unwilling or unable to walk its length is a fact Edward Ford
is apparently by now hardened against He goes through
another door this one indeed bearing the legend MENS R OM

INT MENS ROOM - NIGHT
Pitch black The figure of Edward Ford can just barely be

made out His hand gropes for a light switch but cant find
one He MUMBLES a little to himself
He starts to shuffle his way over to where he senses the
urinals might be The SOUND of a ZIP is heard followed by
the SOUND of what would logically follow -- for some
considerable time -- finally dwindling Then the zip again
Edward Ford starts to leave But now a low drunken grumbling
comes forth

GRUMBLE
»» goddamn sonuvabitch took a
piss on me

And a shadowy figure looms up and shoves past a startled
Edward Ford

INT COZY THEATRE — NIGHT

Back in his seat Edward Ford looks around nervously before
the next picture commences

CUT
INT FACTORY - DAY

Toaster components moving along a conveyor belt Various
hands engaged in the kind of utterly mindless menial work
that will culminate in the construction of the final product
Somewhere along the line sits Edward Ford He looks across
the conveyor belt A woman is working opposite him (MITZI)
She is a cross between a badly-preserved child performer of
long ago and something you might find in a primeval swamp
Edward Ford smiles at her

CUT
INT MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
A more respectable theatre this time Edward Ford and Mitzi
appear Edward Ford starts walking down the aisle as usual

but Mitzi stays where she is Edward Ford goes back to her

MITZI
I like to sit in the back row

EDWARD FORD
Oh Well Okay

He follows her as she leads the way to two seats Hes
obviously displeased at having to sit this far away from the
screen

A LITTLE LATER

Edward Ford marks down a name in his notebook as the
projector beam streaks above him
MITZI
(turning to see what hes
doing)
Whadaya doin

CUT
EXT HOLLYWOOD —- NIGHT

The two of them walk Edward Ford is a good deal taller than
Mitzi

EDWARD FORD
See I write down the actors names in my
little book there cause sometimes they
aint always credited

MITZI
You wrote down when Richard Egan came on -
- he was the star of the movie

EDWARD FORD
Well I wanna get ‘em in order of
appearance too

MITZI
What for I mean who cares

EDWARD FORD
Well yknow I keep file cards at home
and I type out cards on all the players

in and what theatres I saw ‘em at

MITZI
Thats a weird hobby

EDWARD FORD
It keeps me busy

MITZI
How many movies have you seen

EDWARD FORD
Oh gee -- I wouldnt wanna guess I

MITZI

MITZI

EDWARD FORD

MITZI

EDWARD FORDS FACE

As they walk the next half block without anything more to say
to each other

THE PAIR OF THEM
Arrive at the stoop of her crappy apartment building

MITZI
Well

EDWARD FORD
Maybe youd like to go to the show with
me again
MITZI
(noncommittal shrug)
Ill see you at work anyhow

EDWARD FORD
Oh yeah

MITZI

EDWARD FORD

next week Ill have my own place
CUT
EXT EDWARD FORDS APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

Another cheap building

INT EDWARD FORDS APARTMENT - DAY

An extremely cheap place A basic old couch table and chair
Edward Ford appears carrying a few small filing cabinets
over to a corner where he stacks them on some others already
there Then he stands back to look at them

A LITTLE LATER

In a corner Edward Ford sits at a small roll-top desk
hunched over an ancient typewriter He taps out letters with
one finger as he works on an index card The card is Richard
Egans The title Esther and the King has just been added
to his list Edward Ford removes that card inserts a new one
of a different color and begins typing the full cast of the
film His small work lamp the only light in the otherwise
dark apartment the figure in the corner continues to peck
slowly at the keys

CUT
EXT A SMALL CHURCH - DAY

Typical Spanish mission style in the heart of old Hollywood
SINGING is heard from within

INT CHURCH — DAY

The congregation sits down hymn finished At the front the
MINISTER gestures to Edward Ford whos sitting in the first
row to join him Edward Ford stands somewhat sheepishly

MINISTER
I want you all to meet Edward Ford
Edward is joining out church today Hes
come to us from a town called Coventry in
the state of Delaware

The congregation claps Edward Ford nods hello at them

MINISTER (CONTD)
Edward has come here to be an actor in
the movies Im sure we wish him all the
best
(hands him a document)
Here is your certificate Edward Welcome
to our church

EDWARD FORD
(shakes hands)
Thank you

MINISTER
Go in peace

CUT
EXT A SMALL THEATRE —- DAY
At the stage door a paper is posted that says AUDITIONS
Next to it stands a young actor Next to him stands another
And another And another
The line goes halfway around the block Some of the expectant
faces are mouthing the monologues theyve prepared All the
faces seem quite typical of the trade Then Edward Fords
face is reached He waits patiently smoking a cigarette
INT THEATRE - DAY
An ACTOR speaks from the stage
ACTOR
-- Ive prepared a reading from Gorkys
Lower Depths
EXT THEATRE - DAY
The line moves slowly as only a few at a time are ushered in
Edward Ford waits quietly and not nervously A GIRL next to
him murmurs her lines to the sky then stops stymied has to
look down at her paperback Strindberg The little sidewalk
bakes as the day grows hotter
Edward Ford is stopped at the door as the few ahead of him
are allowed in The actor behind him gives Edward Ford a
cursory look
INT THEATRE
Edward Ford has made it to the stage

EDWARD FORD
My name is Edward Ford

In the darkness of the theatre two weary men sit watching

DIRECTOR
What are you going to do for us

EDWARD FORD

When confronted by strange authority speaks in a rather
obsequious way

EDWARD FORD
Im gonna do a scene from Son of
Frankenstein

Silence

DIRECTORS VOICE
Im sorry from what

EDWARD FORD
From Son of Frankenstein the 1939
motion picture starring Basil Rathbone
Boris Karloff --

DIRECTORS VOICE
Okay -- go ahead

Edward Ford gets himself in character Which doesnt get him
very far

EDWARD FORD

This is the classic speech given by
Lionel Atwill

(begins)
It is the most vivid recollection of my
life I was but a child at the time
About the age of your own son Her(sic)
Baron The monster had escaped and was
ravaging the countryside Maiming
Terrorizing One night he

A man alone in the limelight Milking it for all it is worth
The voice he puts on -- not a Lionel Atwill imitation -- is
his acting voice The expression he now puts on is his
acti expression Both are considerably exaggerated in the
manner of B-movie bad-guy conventions circa 1949 This is not
a parody however The performance is delivered with utmost
seriousness Edward Ford also has a particular stock-in-
trade he is fond of twitching psychotically a device of
characterization he uses not exactly sparingly but somehow
selectively his own way perhaps of filling in the pauses
while he catches his breath

EDWARD FORD (CONTD)
burst into our house My father took
a gun and fired at him But the savage
brute sent him crashing to a corner Then
-- he grabbed me by the arm One
doesnt easily forget Her Baron An arm
torn out by the roots

At least it is hard to take ones eyes off him

THE DIRECTOR AND COLLEAGUE
They cant
EDWARD FORD

His own eyes malevolently wide teeth gritted spitting the
final words out

EDWARD FORD

(shaking his head)
No I my lifelong ambition was to
have been a soldier But for this I
who command seven gendarmes in a little
mountain village might have been a
General

Pause And then he is himself again He waits

DIRECTORS VOICE
We have your number do we

EDWARD FORD
Oh yeah Yes you do

DIRECTORS VOICE
Thank you very much

Edward Ford peers into the gloom with a nod and goes
starting to walk the wrong way before turning to walk the
other

THE DIRECTOR AND COLLEAGUE

Still staring at the stage after hes gone

DIRECTOR
Where do they get their ideas

The other man shrugs shaking his head

CUT
EDWARD FORD —- DAY
Sitting quietly on a bench PULLING BACK the bench is
revealed to be in a long LAUNDROMAT Edward Ford sits and

watches his underwear spinning in the dryer

CUT

INT SUPERMARKET — DAY

Edward Ford methodically pushes his cart along consulting a
shopping list and checking coupons in his hand At the
refrigerated meats section he selects a packet of cheap
hamburger At the frozen section he stacks up a pile of
exactly six TV dinners He goes right past the fresh fruit
and vegetable section without stopping once disappearing
around the corner of the aisle

CUT
INT EDWARD FORDS APARTMENT - DAY

A file cabinet drawer is pulled open Edward Fords fingers
run through the cards

EDWARD FORD
Okay now these are the cards on
players

He takes one out shows it to Mitzi

EDWARD FORD (CONTD)
See now for instance heres Walter
Slezaks card -- theres Walter

Points to a small photo of Walter Slezak cut out from
somewhere and cellotaped onto the card in the top right hand
corner

EDWARD FORD (CONTD)
And these are the pictures I seen him in
listed by theatre

Mitzi looks around the apartment in a bored way as Edward
Ford concentrates on the card

EDWARD FORD (CONTD)
And theyre typed in red if he played a
bad guy and they got a little star by
them if he got killed in it

MITZI
How dya know what the movies are

EDWARD FORD
Well I do But if you want a list of the
movies I seen him in you go to the
corresponding card in here --

MITZI
This is a really weird hobby

EDWARD FORD
-- and thatll give ya the individual
titles

He opens another drawer starts going through the cards The
cards in each different section are of different colors

EDWARD FORD (CONTD)
And these here are the theatre cards
(takes a clump out)
These are all the movies I seen at the
Miracle Theatre in South Carolina when I
was in the Army

Mitzi isnt even listening Shes fingering the cards in the
previously-opened drawer

MITZI
They arent even in alphabetical order

Edward Ford turns to see her fiddling -- becomes nervous
moves back there himself finds a card to take out

EDWARD FORD
No -- theyre in the order I last used
‘em Like I aint seen Minna Gombell in
a picture since July 15th 1950 so her
card is near the back But I know where
they all are

MITZI

to play a bad guy that gets killed ina
motion picture -- sos I can type it in
red with a little star by it

INT ANOTHER SLEAZY APARTMENT - DAY

LESTER ADAMS a man not far from the old actors alcoholic
death home reclines on his broken-down sofa watching TV A
rotten T-shirt delineates his pot belly Sitting next to him
is JED DOBIE another veteran of the time when men were men
and women were Vera Hruba Ralston While Lester is rather
lean and mean-looking there is something jovial about Jed
Dobie and his big ole white beard and grizzly voice
JED
Then there was that thing we did over at
Monogram that time

JED
Youd say that of course

LESTER

INT HAROLD BLAKES HOUSE (BATHROOM) - NIGHT

HAROLD BLAKE is a rather dapper man though slightly pudgy
with a babyish sort of face He is in the unclean bathroom of
his little house taking off his shirt revealing a lacy
black negligee underneath the bottom half of it tucked into
his trousers Needle and cotton and other items laid out next
to him he sits down to prepare his arm for an injection of
heroin

INT MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

A party in progress Rarely has such a collection of genuine
human oddities been gathered in one place Everyone here is
strictly grade-Z They represent the true underbelly of
Hollywood society which doesnt speak well of their position
in the world at large The best-looking women here are some
sort of secondary porn actresses the worst the most horrific
type of hangers-on to lost dreams women whose make-up
exceeds the weight of their mock jewelry and whose wardrobe
seems to have come straight from Transylvania A man fatter
than some whales reads the palm of a deranged-looking boy
clutching it in his own sweaty mitt Some cheap bit players
sit around kvetching and boozing A Satanic diabolist lights
up a dubious cigarette An aged crone does a little dance An
albino laughs This looks like a wedding reception for Tod
Browning and Diane Arbus

Edward Ford now enters this melange holding the hand of his
wife Lester Adams leads the way ahead already shaking hands
with friends

Elsewhere Harold Blake comes down a sagging staircase from
upstairs looking rather breezy now jacket and tie back on
over his negligee He smiles at his guests inquiring after
the good time he hopes theyre having He is certainly
capable of exuding charm however perverse a variety it may
be

Lester Adams introduces the Edward Fords to folks

LESTER
Harrys wife Patty --

Not an unattractive woman actually

In a doorway a drunken man has his hand up the dress of an
underage black girl

A LITTLE LATER

Edward Ford sits stiffly with a drink in his hand next to
Harold Blake

BLAKE
Lester tells me you like westerns

EDWARD FORD
Well -- I am an avid B-western fan but I
like most all kinds of motion pictures
especially old ones

BLAKE
Oh Ive directed two or three westerns --
Lester starred in ‘em

EDWARD FORD
Ive seen two of them

BLAKE
But you know Im concentrating on
contemporary subjects now You waste so
much time with those damn horses

EDWARD FORD
Are you making a movie now

BLAKE
Well Im trying to raise the finance

EDWARD FORD
Uh-huh

A strange-looking woman sits down next to Edward Ford on the
armrest of the couch

WOMAN
Hi Harry

BLAKE
Hey Johnny

WOMAN
Joanie

Edward Fords head swivels between the two of them

BLAKE
Hey show ‘em your tits John

WOMAN

WOMAN
All right is everybody watching this

Everybody answers in the affirmative

WOMAN (CONTD)

She lifts her blouse to show her new knockers People cheer
and clap and laugh Shes so proud Someones hand reaches
into view to feel one of them
WOMAN (CONTD)
Arent they great And they feel so
natural

Harry Blake laughs Mitzi Ford laughs

Edward Ford has his quintessential expression on his face
tempered only by slight queasiness

A LITTLE LATER

Boozy people dance to scratchy records Edward Fords wife
dances with someone who looks like a magician

In the doorway the same drunken man now has the transsexual
pinned and has his hand up her dress

Edward Ford stands in a corner talking to actor LAIRD BREEN

BREEN
Its tough thats all Im not gonna
paint you a rosy picture You cant get
in the Guild till you get a job and its
hard to get a job unless youre in the
Guild Ive been in the acting game for
ten years now and its hard Its hard

Edward Ford nods seriously

Mitzi Ford is now dancing with the albino The weird old
crone dances past them all by herself

Lester Adams and Harold Blake laugh boisterously drinking
from a shared bottle

Edward Ford continues to submit to the expert

BREEN (CONTD)
But I wish you all the best and when you
get that first line of dialogue youre
welcome to give me a call and Ill put
you onto some people

EDWARD FORD
Well I would really appreciate that
That would be swell

He thinks the thing to do is formally offer his hand Laird
Breen accepts it and Edward Ford shakes solemnly

EXT HAROLD BLAKES HOUSE - NIGHT

Its a bizarre kind of shack perched on a hillside ina
cramped

section of the eccentric old Los Feliz district Twinkling

lights in the city below Edward Ford and Mitzi are on their
way out shaking hands with Patty Blake

PATTY

MITZI
Thank you for having us

a Bible He is portraying Temptation and hes decided this
calls far his best bad-guy voice He opens the book to show
the woman

EDWARD FORD
- Drugs Would you like some more

He smiles at the poor wretch with what he takes to be Satanic
glee The woman looks between him and the other serious man
with what she takes to be anguish

people here are a far cry from the people were used to
seeing in Edward Ford land Luke early twenties sits
talking to BEVERLY HILLS WIFE

WIFE
But why doesnt he take acting classes or
something

LUKE
Because hes a nutcase He didnt even
come here to become an actor he came to
be a bad guy in B-Westerns You
understand what B-Westerns were -- it
doesnt mean a poor Gary Cooper movie

WIFE
Sure -- Gene Autry --

LUKE
Yeah like that -- appalling things It
was an entire subculture -- and for him

its like the planet Krypton blowing up
cause they just barely made the last
three while he was still on the bus

WIFE
So hes just been an extra all these
years

LUKE
Hes never managed to be an extra -- hes

a waiver When a film has its quota of
extras they hire people who waive all
rights to minimum day wages and
recognition as a human being

WIFE
Waiver -- Ive never heard that term

LUKE
In a biblical movie the people you see
huddled around on the grass listening
attentively to Christ those are the
extras The tiny dots on that hilltop
fifteen miles to the north -- waivers

Art Linson walks by

A LITTLE LATER
William Sackheim walks by

LUKE
He actually befriended a couple of the
old cowboy character actors hed always
literally looked up to -- and they were
like old bums by the time he showed up

WIFE
Youd think he couldve found some way at
least of utilizing all his movie
knowledge

LUKE
No -- its not even -- its not exactly
an expertise Its not like he knows
movies just cast lists yknow -- its a
form of madness

WIFE
Does he like girls

LUKE
Well I dont know that girls have ever
been introduced into his life I mean
uh certain types of demented she-goat --

WIFE
(laughs)
When can we meet this person

LUKE
Well next time my father visits hes
thinking of putting all his LA friends
in one room together to see what happens
The naked and the dead

WIFE
And you see a lot of this fellow

LUKE
Oh sure -- hes my best friend here

CUT
INT PATTY BLAKES APARTMENT - DAY

Luke is looking at what Harold Blake married Shes sitting
across the room chatting with Edward Ford but for Luke its
like theyre just back-projection or something their
conversation muted Patty Blake is a destroyed old hag
crutches leaning near her She looks twenty years older than
her actual age whatever it is by now and she squints and
strains to hear what Edward Ford is saying to her Her room
is the bottom of the barrel The floor is covered with old
magazines and yellowed newspapers and other bits of
miscellaneous garbage And dog shit The motheaten creature
responsible for this prowls listlessly around A black-and-
white fuzzy TV broadcasts midday soap opera Luke watches the
dust swimming in the sunlight rays that somehow manage to
filter through the slime on the window next to him The dirt-
caked fly screen is torn in places and partly hangs out of
its frame

A LITTLE LATER
Patty Blake supporting herself on her crutches shows her
visitors out Edward Ford steps back after kissing her
goodbye She looks at Luke
PATTY
(indicating Edward Ford)
This is a good guy

LUKE
Yeah

Edward Ford and Luke walk away over the shabby carpeting in
the bleak brown light They go down some warped and creaking
stairs

CUT
INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Luke has a hamburger Edward Ford a sandwich In another

booth sits a black man with a white girl who has a big
bandage across half her head

At the counter sits a strange-looking short man with a thin
greased moustache wearing funny trousers and a loud cowboy
shirt About to enter is a big-boned crazed young woman who
wont be able to stop chattering weirdly to the waitress The
waitress is an older woman once probably rather pretty
trying to hold onto her dignity Luke whos still thinking
of Patty Blake and the foul smell of her building watches
the nut for a while

LUKE
Would you go to bed with that for your
SAG card

EDWARD FORD
Uh -- negative No I would not

LUKE
You used to do things like that

EDWARD FORD
Well those were in my younger days I
just wanna meet a nice girl If I hada
nice girl I wouldnt go round lookin at
whores no more Just a nice girl and some
bad guy parts thats all I want

LUKE
You wouldnt appear in a hardcore
homosexual fist movie for your SAG card

EDWARD FORD
That is correct I would not No way

LUKE
How about for a million dollars

EDWARD FORD
No

LUKE
Who would you rather sleep with Maria
Ouspenskaya or Beulha Bondi

EDWARD FORD

Luke glances at CAMERA and gestures at Edward Ford as if
requesting corroboration for the mans eccentricity

table sell to incoming people About half the folding chairs
are filled Everyone else here is black Waiting for the show
to start

BEN
- He must have gotten something from
the sale of his parents house dont you
think

Unless they accumulated a lot of medical
bills at the end maybe Or unless his
brother got it

LUKE
Well the cab company went bust more than
a year ago but he goes down every
Wednesday and still gets forty dollars

strike benefit -- so something keeps him
afloat Working as an extra here and
there

BEN

Its strange to think of Edward Ford as a
man of leisure now Maybe itll make him
even more bizarre In some vegetating

way
LUKE
I dont know I think hes -- content I
mean he has other associations -- people
from his church -- plays cards with
people
BEN

Yes Ordinary American types

LUKE
Right Morons

BEN
Its amazing hes found a little niche in

Luke is a little embarrassed to be standing in line here with
Edward Ford Everyone else is from the world of the hip
Trendy young couples college students talking film
Nearer the entrance are people dressed as characters from the
most famous Harold Blake production “Invaders From Planet
Ten T-shirts and buttons are being sold A TV news magazine
crew is on hand interviewing people as they go in And Laird
Breen a guest speaker at the festival is here too

EDWARD FORD

No No I dont have to

CUT

INT MOVIE THEATRE

Absolutely packed The crowd is loud and boisterous Edward

Ford and Luke have just come in wondering where theyre

going to sit

EDWARD FORD
Oh gee

They start walking down the aisle looking for seats Edward
Ford sees one in the third row on the side aisle

EDWARD FORD (CONTD)
Well I guess I better take that one

LUKE
Yeah Ill go back to the uh back

He does that somewhat relieved that it worked out this way
He finds a seat way at the back by the wall getting past
people to slouch into it

UP FRONT

Two bearded types wearing glasses and Invaders T-shirts
take the microphone

1ST BEARD
Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to the
Harold Blake movie marathon

The audience yells cheers jeers laughs as they will
continue to do with near religious hysteria throughout

1ST BEARD (CONTD)
For those of you unfamiliar with Mr
Blakes unique oeuvre suffice it to say
youre in for a very special film
experience today For those of you
already used to staying up until two
oclock in the morning to catch these on
your local zombie station what can I
say -- great cocaine demands an encore
right

The audience goes out of their heads
Edward Ford sits through this nonsense impatiently He tries

to look disapproving as they make a mockery of his late
friend

2ND BEARD
Were starting off the programme with
Blakes own 82 -- the frankly
autobiographical The She-Male -- made

in 1956 when Blake was at the height of
his creative powers

Luke is likewise not participating in the audience
participation considering this crowd every bit as creepy as
the Harry BlakeEdward Ford world they find so hilarious

2ND BEARD (CONTD)
a crowning achievement of art povera
a film like Abel Gances Napoleon in
which one mans personal auteurist vision
at once refines and revolutionizes the
whole concept of cinema

(FLASHBACK) INT HAROLD BLAKES APARTMENT - DAY

Harold Blake sitting in a tatty chair in his decrepit
apartment at the end of his life wearing just a dirty pair
of trousers and a brassiere smoking a cigarette unshaven a
bottle next to him on a side table The SOUND of the movie
marathon continues

1ST BEARDS VOICE
Notice if you will in the dialogue
scenes of this film the startling use of
nonsequitur -- as well as the sense of
heightened reality created by the
constant repetition of Blakes favorite
word such -- as in the memorable line
Such do the sands of time tell us what
we have to know of the unknown

We HEAR the audience HOWL with laughter -- as Harold Blake
watches a few flies buzzing around him

(PRESENT) INT MOVIE THEATRE

Darkened now the first film showing The audience are all
swaying and clapping in unison to the rhythm of the films
music soundtrack a ludicrous scene obviously in progress

Moving along a row of people all together now the tempo of
the music leading everyone to yell Yeah every few chords
we come to Edward Ford whos simply trying to watch the
film

Luke is seriously trying to watch it too but in disbelief a
great grin on his face as he joins in the communal mirth in
spirit if not action

(FLASHBACK) INT HAROLD BLAKES APARTMENT

Patty Blake also tanked up enters carrying a couple of
plates of baked beans She sets them down on the table and
starts to take a cracker out of an old box already there She
is at this time not quite as eerie-looking as she will
become but still well on the way to her ultimate destiny of
degradation

1ST BEARDS VOICE
Then in 1958 Blake produced his
masterpiece -- Invaders From Planet
Ten
(audience SCREAMS)

A true marriage of idiosyncratic casting
and plotting and genuine directorial
ineptitude -- the film that most clearly
stands today as the highest perfection of
Blakes mise en scene

Blake has joined his wife at the table brought his bottle
with him They start in on the baked beans

2ND BEARDS VOICE
Pay particular attention to the now
famous menagerie scene in which there are
more mistakes than in any other single
sequence in the history of cinema No
series of images in Blakes canon answers
more cogently to the total incoherency of
his visual style

Patty reaches for the bottle but Harry pulls it back and
yells at her She tries to grab it again but he keeps it at
arms length

1ST BEARDS VOICE
For instance youll see the chemist pick
up a phone and start talking -- without
any preceding ringing or dialing And
when he gets attacked by the giant
python notice how he has to wrap it
around himself because Blake couldnt
afford an actual working model

Patty finally in fury flings her plate of baked beans at her
husband As they drip down his chest and over his bra he
comes after her She gets surprisingly quickly to her feet
too keeping the table in the middle as he tries to get hold
of her chasing her around it has fingers snatching at the
air between them As an extension he picks up his bottle and
starts swinging it at her as he chases whatever drink is
left in it spilling as he does -- but Pattys still moving
around the table stumbling from time to time but still
faster than him finally it occurs to Harry Blake to knock
the damn table aside He corners his wife swings the bottle
at her again and this time it catches her chin knocking her

to the floor
(PRESENT) INT MOVIE THEATRE

On the screen in black-and-white flying saucers swoop
down from the skies on strings Then in a cut that doesnt
match at all a citizen played by Laird Breen points at the
sky though he is clearly in a cheap studio set

CITIZEN
The Saucermen are coming

Cut back to the flying saucers an exact duplicate of the
previous shot of them

Luke watches this travesty never in his life seen production
values so shoddy

THE GIRL NEXT TO LUKE
Hubcaps Theyre hubcaps

As a corporal approaches a General on the screen the
audience tenses to speak the dialogue in sync with the
actors

CORPORAL AND AUDIENCE
The SuperAtom Missile is ready Sir

GENERAL AND AUDIENCE
Thank you for telling me Sergeant

Edward Ford is straining to hear the actors not the people
around him

(FLASHBACK) INT HAROLD BLAKES APARTMENT

Harrys in his tiny kitchen now rummaging through the
garbage SOUND is with him now He tips the garbage out onto
the floor some cockroaches scurrying away He finds an old
bottle Puts it to his lips but whatever might have been
left in it has evaporated by now

In the other room Patty Blake staggers to her feet her chin
starting to swell up

In the kitchen at the tap Harry Blake puts some water in
the old bottle swirls it around a bit then drinks it Patty
comes in

PATTY
(doesnt sound at all well)
You shithead

He shoves past her she hits him feebly
EXT HAROLD BLAKES APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Harry Blake comes out of his apartment and the SOUND that
follows him now is a continuation of the climax of Invaders
From Planet Ten a mass of explosions whizzing saucer
effects snatches of burlesque dialogue crashing cars
sirens shrieking Harry knocks on the door of a neighboring
apartment It opens a touch but when its ratty resident sees
Harry Blake standing there in his bra pleadingly displaying
his empty bottle the door with difficulty is shut

Harry starts down the steps into the awful little courtyard
of this filthy apartment dwelling He starts to walk through
it but halfway across suddenly clutches his stomach then
wrapping both arms tightly around himself he keels over into
the leaves on the ground Blood starts coming out of him from
everywhere

LAIRD BREEN
1ST BEARDS VOICE

Laird Breen was a charter member of the

Harold Blake stock company
Laird is REVEALED in the same courtyard giving positive
identification to a police officer before Harrys body on a
stretcher is covered up by ambulance men Two other policemen
in the background try to talk to a still raving-drunk Patty
Blake
The present-day audience is HEARD CLAPPING
(PRESENT) INT MOVIE THEATRE

Laird Breen talks to the audience

BREEN
Well we all knew they were kinda
cheapies -- but Harry had this kinda

knack for gettin everybody together and
gettin these damn films made And he was
proud of what he did -- proud of just
getting the effect -- no matter how
crappy it looked

(FLASHBACK) EXT HAROLD BLAKES COURTYARD

The ambulance men carry the stretcher to their waiting
vehicle Patty Blake is still screaming foully at the cops
They keep their heads up to protect against sudden movements
on her part Neighbors watch from a safe distance

1ST BEARDS VOICE
Believe me youre not hallucinating --
when you see the Bride of the Crocodile
trip over the cardboard tombstone and it
falls over Blake cuts to a reverse angle
and suddenly its daylight This is
because he was going to take the film to
the lab to have the sky darkened in day-
for-night scenes but then forgot

Patty Blake falls over backwards

Laird Breen alone on the pot-holed sidewalk watches the
stretcher go into the ambulance and the doors close after it

2ND BEARDS VOICE
And when the police car arrives -- which
is just an ordinary car with a lamp stuck
on its hood -- and it turns a corner --
when it comes round the other side --
completely different car

As the ambulance carries away the dead Harold Blake the
SOUND of the LAUGHTER of the present-day crowd grows and
grows

My reaction was spontaneous (sic) I spit
and kicked him in the head at the same
time And when I left I could heard --
hear him in the next cubicle crying and
whimpering

(leans close to mike with

extreme bad-guy voice)
But the little bastard had it comin to
‘im

EXT LUKES APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
The odd voice from the lit top floor apartment talks on

EDWARD FORDS VOICE
Another time

(cough)
we were drivin in Joshua Tree National
Monument -- out in the desert there --
LUKE

-- Talk in your real voice --

EDWARD FORD
(doesnt)
-- and uh my author friend I went to
high school with --

LUKE
-- I wont play this for anyone its
just notes -- come on --

EDWARD FORD
-- he shit in his pants And he just took
his underwear and threw it off behind a
boulder somewhere --
(Luke cant help laughing now)

And the smell was so raunchous I got out
of the car I just could not stay in that
car

He takes a sip from his glass of orange juice

LUKE
Has anyone ever told you what a fertile
mind you have

A LITTLE LATER

Edward Ford continues going over the big incidents in his
life The walls of Lukes apartment are covered with movie
posters The Sand Pebbles Django Kill Get Carter
Ulzanas Raid a Michael Powell at Dartmouth College
poster a couple of Lukes fathers exhibition posters a
Kafka exhibition poster

EDWARD FORDS VOICE
(imitating a skid row bum)
Goddamn sonuvabitch took a piss
on me And I could feel a dark shape
grope past me and shuffle out of the can

Edward Ford smokes a cigarette while he talks into the tape
recorder Luke listens numbly

EDWARD FORD
See I figured over in the corner thats

where the pisser would be yknow -- the
Urinals

(says your-eye-nals)
Cause it was pitch black -- pitch black -

- and I was in a hurry to take a great
piss So I just took out my thing yknow
-- and also I didnt want to miss uh
the second feature

LUKE
That was your favorite theatre the Cosy

EDWARD FORD
(leans forward to mike)
Yes -- like the little fella here says --
the Cosy was my favorite theatre In my
early days in Los Angeles I went to the
closing night show And I was sad

EXT LUKES APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Down below in the alley at the large garbage containers a
gone-to-seed hippie searches for items of interest

LUKES VOICE
You remember what was playing

INT LUKES APARTMENT

EDWARD FORD
Yes I do The Killers was the first
picture with Edmond OBrien and Burt
Lancaster and one of my alltime favorite
actors Noel Cravat played Lou Tingle
And the second picture was West of Pinto
Basin with Max Alibi Terhune Ray
Crash Corrigan John Dusty King and
Tristram Coffin -- and Bud Osborne had a
good part Damn good part

SPLIT SCREEN

Edward Ford remains on the left continuing to talk Luke
feeding him questions while on the right he goes about his
life as usual

LUKES VOICE
Isnt he on your Big Six

Edward Ford sits in the very same LAUNDROMAT hes been
frequenting all these years watching his underwear going
round and round

EDWARD FORD
Uh no not he Tristram Coffin used to
be but he got bumped by Robert J Wilke

LUKES VOICE
Now hes actually been in some good
movies

In his little dusty APARTMENT working on file cards

EDWARD FORD
Sure he has

Later he sits alone watching TV
LUKES VOICE
Was he one of the guys waiting for the

train in High Noon

Exactly six TV dinners are removed from the SUPERMARKET
frozen food section by Edward Ford

EDWARD FORD
Youre darn tootin

LUKES VOICE
Of course his moment of glory came when
James Coburn stuck a knife in him

And he pushes his cart along the entire Fresh Produce aisle
without pausing once

EDWARD FORD
(starting to slip into his real
voice)
Yeah The Magnificent Seven

LUKES VOICE
Did you type him in red for that

Back in his APARTMENT he studies the movie section of the
newspaper making little pencil check marks against possible
choices

EDWARD FORD
Nah -- he wasnt really a bad guy -- just
a loudmouth

From the FREEWAY OFF RAMP he can see the white golfball-like
domes of the cinema complex hes visiting one early evening

LUKES VOICE
You ought to have a point system to
determine badness I mean you put Paul
Newman and Robert Redford in The Sting
in the same category as Brian Donlevy in
Beau Geste or Widmark in Kiss of
Death

On WILCOX AVENUE one day he picks up a slovenly young hooker
hitchhiker

EDWARD FORD
A bad guy is a bad guy

Back in his APARTMENT as the hooker leaves he gargles with
mouthwash

LUKES VOICE
Yeah but by your reasoning Captain Bligh
is the good guy and Clark Gable is the
bad guy ‘cause hes a mutineer Youd
make Fredric March the bad guy for
stealing a loaf of bread --

An impoverished black theatre group in a WORKSHOP venue put
on their revisionist production of West Side Story The
only white member of the cast in a cops uniform grimaces
maniacally as with excessively overwrought gestures
rivalling those found in Expressionist and Revolutionary
cinema of the Twenties he terrorizes rebellious black youth
into submission

EDWARD FORD
No now thats different

LUKES VOICE
How is it diff --

In CHURCH Edward Ford sings along

EDWARD FORD
Newman and Redford were on the wrong side
of the law -- they were scoundrels

OUTSIDE THE CHURCH Edward Ford socializes An absurd-looking
ninety-nine year old Hollywood OLD LADY with elaborately-dyed
hair countless cosmetic operations and possibly a hunchback
to boot waves a frail wrinkled hand at Edward Ford as she
totters away

OLD LADY
Watch for me on Fantasy Island

INT LUKES APARTMENT - DAY

Luke sits at his desk making notes as the recorder plays next
to him

EDWARD FORDS VOICE
Thats one reason I like old movies
yknow -- it was always real clear They
had great casts and who youre supposed
to root for was always real clear

LUKES VOICE
Who are the Big Six

We SEE them Their black-and-white publicity photos FILL THE
SCREEN one after the other

EDWARD FORDS VOICE
Well Lester and Jed of course Edmund
Cobb Tom London James Flavin -- hes
the only non-western actor on the Big
Six And Fred Graham Emmett Vogan is
pretty high up
Eddie Parker is gettin up there I seen
him in ninety-eight films

RESUME SCENE
Luke rolls a sheet of paper into his typewriter
LUKES VOICE
Would you make my character a bad guy for

writing a script about you

EDWARD FORDS VOICE
Probably

INT XEROX SHOP — DAY

Luke waits at the counter He notices some woman waiting

CUT

nearby clutching her own screenplay Luke almost smiles to
himself one look at her enough to confirm her loser status

He notices on his other side some talentless-looking fool

being given copies of his pathetic screenplay Then one of
the CHINAMEN behind the counter brings Luke his copies Luke
flips through one to check it out He looks at the last page

THE LAST PAGE OF THE SCRIPT
It reads PETES VOICE
Im gonna make a million
