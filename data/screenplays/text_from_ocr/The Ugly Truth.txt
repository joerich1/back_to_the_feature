your ass And they stick around
because of what youre willing to
do with them You want to win a man

MIKE
Well youre describing a woman

THE UGLY TRUTH - Numbered Script - 2142008

ABBY

MIKE
Where is this guy I will give you
one hundred dollars of my own money

JOSH

THE UGLY TRUTH - Numbered Script - 2142008
22 STUART
His name is Mike Alexander

ABBY
And hes a quintessential
misogynist uber-moron who

represents everything wrong with

television and society at large

DORI
I get crap every time I suggest we

and now youre gonna put this
douchebag on the air

STUART
Hes got a point of view We dont
have to like him were news

ABBY
What are you talking about
Albuquerque is 45 Latino

MIKE
Yeah and as you can tell by all
the screaming rugrats in this town
Latino guys like to have a lot of

hot chicks than hear about why they
cant bring grandma across the
border

A KNOCK Then the door opens and Mike appears

MIKE
Hey no hard feelings right

ABBY
You dont even knock

MIKE

ABBY

negated by your complete lack of
adherence to the social etiquette
of what follows a knock

THE UGLY TRUTH - Numbered Script - 2142008

MIKE
Wow You are wound like a fuckin
top
Abby glares at him
ABBY

ABBY
There is no way Mike Alexander is
going to stay on my show I want
you to skewer him Make him look
like a complete idiot Not that it
will be hard The man is a moron of
unseen proportions

GEORGIA
(re Larry)
Thats just what we need on this
show
LARRY

Does anyone think my highlights are
too shiny

ABBY
Larry listen to me I want Mike
Alexander to go down in flames I
want Mike Alexander to be nothing
but a pile of ash on the seat next
to you I want the janitor to come
in with his Dustbuster and vacuum
up the ashes of Mike Alexander and
then when he throws the ashes into
the dumpster outside I want the
rats to vomit and then defecate on
the ashes of Mike Alexander

She strides off Larry looks at Georgia

LARRY
And I thought you were angry and
bitter

GEORGIA
Uh no that would be my untouched
vagina

Cameras roll as Larry and Georgia sit at the anchor desk

THE UGLY TRUTH - Numbered Script - 2142008

GEORGIA
For years there have been concerns
about lowering television
standards But many believe that
this man and his local public
access show The Ugly Truth have
brought things to a new low With
that we welcome Mike Alexander

Mike gives a cocky wave

MIKE
How ya doing guys

LARRY
Mike how do you respond to those
who say your show is offensive

MIKE
It is but then again so is the
truth
GEORGIA
The truth about what Mr
Alexander
MIKE

What relationships are really like

26 INT KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

pressure and taxes Its not about
love and we should stop pretending

ABBY
Cmon Georgia let him have it

GEORGIA
Sounds to me like no ones ever
loved you and youre taking it out
on the female population

In the control room Abby smirks

THE UGLY TRUTH - Numbered Script - 2142008

ABBY
Ooh good one

MIKE

Cliff

ABBY

Cliff shrugs Abby is pissed

ABBY

CLIFF

On the set Mike continues his vivisection of Larry and
Georgia

MIKE
I mean come on Larry I grew up
watching you on TV You used to be
this cool confident cat Georgias
no dumb bunny She knew the only
way she was getting off the weekend
shift was by hooking up with you
But then lo and behold she became
more popular than you and ended up
with twice your salary

ABBY
Cmon Larry Take him down

She starts twisting her straw into shapes as --

THE UGLY TRUTH - Numbered Script - 2142008

LARRY
Im proud of my wifes success

MIKE
Bullllloney you are You hate her
success You feel emasculated by
her and that screws with your head
which inevitably screws with your
manhood

GEORGIA
Whats your point Mr Alexander

ABBY
Good girl Georgia Take control

MIKE
My point My point is that your
husband hasnt had sex with you
inIm gonna say three
months

LARRY
Thats not my fault

MIKE
I know its her fault

GEORGIA
Why is it my fault

In the control room Abby looks like shes going to pass out

ABBY
Oh dear God

GEORGIA
Well what am I supposed to do
give up the money so he can get an
erection

MIKE
I agree Youve economically
emasculated your husband to such a
point that hes afraid to desire
you Sure you can dump his ass
but honey have you seen the
eligible men in Albuquerque Its
slim pickings out there for a woman
in her forties Youre not going to
do any better than Larry You just
have to let him be a man LET HIM
