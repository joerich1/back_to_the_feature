OVER BLACK

We listen to the immortal music of Mozarts Adagio of the
Clarinet Concerto in A

FADE

EXT THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Space infinite and empty

But then slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move
into frame and align

The last of them is the giant burning sphere of the sun
Just as the sun enters frame a solar storm of gigantic
proportion unfolds The eruptions shoot thousands of miles

into the blackness of space

EXT COUNTRY SIDEINDIA - SUNSET

Mozarts concerto filters from a jeeps stereo fighting the

drumming sounds of the monsoon rain PROF FREDERIC WEST
66

listens to the music

An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
ship across a puddle

The Professor turns to his driver pointing to the boy

PROF WEST
Watch out

But its too late The jeep drives straight through the
puddle at full speed sinking the boys toy ship

In the background the jeep stops in front of a building
The

driver jumps out leading the Professor towards its
entrance

The sign at the door reads “Institute for Astrophysics -
University of New Delhi

INT NAGA-DENG MINEINDIA - SUNSET

An endless mine shaft An old elevator cage comes to a
grinding halt When Prof West steps out we see that he is
accompanied now by a nervous DR SATNAM TSURUTANI 32

PROF WEST
How deep are we

SATNAM
8200 feet Used to be an old copper
mine Professor sir

As Prof West follows Satnam he takes in the unusual
setting
for this science lab

PROF WEST
Helmsley told me that the neutrino
count doubled during the last sun
eruptions
TO

SATNAM
Correct sir But that is not what
worries me

They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings A small
group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers which all
show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier

SATNAM (CONTD)
There was a new solar storm so strong
that the physical reaction got even
more severe

PROF WEST
How can that be

SATNAM
We dont know Professor sir

Satnam walks over into another room There he opens a hatch
on the floor and hot steam rises

SATNAM (CONTD)
The neutrinos suddenly act like
microwaves

Prof West slowly steps closer When he discovers that the
water in the tank below is boiling his face goes pale

EXT LARGE TERRACEWASHINGTON DC - EVENING

A major fund raising party is under way The setting is
spectacular A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and

ADRIAN HELMSLEY 32 stands with a group of young POLITICAL
AIDES He is the only African-American among them

One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER 58 White House Chief
of Staff working the crowd

POLITICAL AID 1

ADRIAN

him of all people to run the White
House

with his toy ship

INT HALLWAYWHITE HOUSE - DAY

Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White
House

ADRIAN
Sir the President needs to know this

ANHEUSER
Helmsley how long have you been on the
job as science advisor

ADRIAN
Four months this week

ANHEUSER
I would say thats enough time to learn
that we have rules here Youll just
have to wait until the quarterly
science briefing

ADRIAN
If this is about what I said last
night I am truly sorry sir

ANHEUSER
So you didnt like my speech

Exasperated Adrian holds out the papers to him

ADRIAN
Can you please have a look at this
sir Its really important

Finally Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and
starts
to walk away reading

Suddenly he slows down

ANHEUSER
Who wrote this

ADRIAN
An Indian astrophysicist I graduated
with from Harvard and Prof West the
preeminent geologist in the US

ANHEUSER
Who else knows about it

ADRIAN
No one sir

ANHEUSER
Lets keep it that way Helmsley

In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event
will unfold Caused by an alignment of
the planets in our solar system that
only happens every 640000 years
Just imagine the earth as an Orange

Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange

CHARLIES VOICE (CONTD)
our sun will begin to emit such
extreme amounts of radiation that the
core of the earth will melt - thats
the inside part of the Orange leaving
the crust of our planet free to shift

On screen the middle of the orange shrinks now the skin
moves freely around it

CHARLIE FROST
and Albert Einstein endorsed it

The infamous photo of Einstein sticking out his tongue

CHARLIE FROST (CONTD)
The forces of mother nature will be so
devastating it will bring an end to
this world on winter solstice 12-21-12

water

Then the economy boom The dollar
boom And then the people in the

Boom boom Pandemonium revolution
war They would never tell us Beer

Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever The plane
almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them
gives way

They hover for a moment almost caught in mid-air as the

bowels of the earth Gordon fights to maintain control but
they begin to be pulled down

The daylight vanishes Debris and mud smashes into the plane
from all sides The canyon walls erupt

Taking desperate measures Gordon nearly rips the control

stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out

the abyss

are

flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los

plane through the tumbling high rises

They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK

crumble beneath them Kate covers Lillys eyes

himself

snow the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers

The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the

cars out of the back cargo hold They barrel past the

like skittles narrowly missing it as they fly off in

causing the aircraft to break apart

hoots towards the ledge in the Antonov plunging into the
deep
