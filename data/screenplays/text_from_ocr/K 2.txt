FADE IN

i INT SEATTLE BAR ROOM NIGHT iit

IN THE BACKGROUND a MAN and WOMAN dance dirty while a hot SAX
blows a long blue note VOICES and LAUGHTER OVER Meanwhile

IN THE FOREGROUND a plain MAN’S WEDDING RING suspended on a
long double strand of blonde HAIR describes a counter—clockwise
circle in the air above a DRINKS TABLE The improvised pendulum
is held by a strong MAN’S HAND And then we hear a strong MANS
VOICE

TAYLOR VO
Youre lying

Stay on the PENDULUM as its motion increases A woman GIGGLES

TAYLOR VO
What did I tell you Lisa
There’s no point lying to
me I got a million ways
of knowing

TAYLOR’S RIGHT HAND drops the ring and then goes under the table
and into LISA’S LAP where it finds and grasps her left hand Her
hand tries to escape but Taylor’s holds it firmly

TAYLOR VO
Your palm’s sweating -—-—

We see LISA for the first time thirtysomething long blonde
hair bubbly but not particularly bright a good-looking good-
time party girl who has just recently digested the statistic that
a woman of her age and background has as much chance of getting
married as she has of being kidnapped and murdered by terrorists

TAYLOR V0
You’re blushing ---

On cue LISA BLUSHES Her darker younger more bewitching friend
TRACY who sits on her right leans across and challenges TAYLOR

TRACY
Back off Killer I bet
you’re not exactly twenty-—
one yourself

TAYLOR
Close Im forty-two

TAYLOR is taut dark and handsome and doesn’t need to lie about
his age The look in his black extrovert adventurer’s eyes
alternates between piercingcompulsive and farawayinscrutable

On Taylor’s left sits HAROLD Younger than his friend he is also
more detached more intellectual Unable to take so readily what
he wants from life Harold watches analyses weighs before he
acts Where Taylor’s first impulse is to seize and confront — or
te search and destroy Harold’s is to observe and confirm

HAROLD watches TRACY as he puts back on his WEDDING RING Despite
his marital status he is severely attracted to her Harold can
tell that despite or because of the confrontation that Taylor
has triggered these two girls have already decided to fuck them

TRACY
Bullshit

TAYLOR
Ill take that as a compliment

TRACY
Take it any way you want

LISA
What do you guys do anyway

TAYLOR
Me I’m an explorer

TRACY
In a suit like that You’re an
accountant or a lawyer or some
thing I’ve seen you around

TAYLOR
Im an accountant Feel this

TAYLOR guides LISA’S HAND up his right arm to his bicep

TAYLOR
Since when do accountants
have biceps like that Huh

TRACY
Anybody can do weights

TAYLOR
T’m an explorer - and so is my
quiet friend here — kind of
You ever kissed a gynecologist

Spiderwoman

TRACY
Gimme a break I saw that
movie

TAYLOR

Oh right And you’re one
of those mutant women

Now TRACY who happens to have unusually large breasts flushes

TAYLOR
Never mind he’s got just
the piece of equipment to
deal with you

HAROLD
Look I’m sorry about my
friend Hes the mutant

TAYLOR
Shut up H and go and sit
over there next to -—

TRACY
Tracy

HAROLD is uncomfortable for several reasons and makes no move to
obey orders After a few moments of inaction

TAYLOR
No Okay Tracy you go and
sit next to Harold Go on

TRACY smiles ruefully stands up nevertheless and while

UNDER THE TABLE TAYLOR’S adventurous RIGHT HAND explores the
darkest depths of LISA’S bikini zone

TRACY very slowly moves around behind TAYLOR and LISA until she is
standing beside HAROLD As he stands to her she sits They smile
obliquely at each other and he sits again He is very self-
conscious next to her Tracy is not only sexy but she is sending
out some very complex signals And how Harold would love to have
the time to spend decoding them

While beside them the intrepid TAYLOR already has his tongue
deep down LISA’S throat TRACY takes shy HAROLD’S LEFT HAND and
studies his WEDDING RING They both wonder where - or if - to
start

TRACY
You still in love with your wife
HAROLD
Yes
2iINTEXT TAYLOR’S PORSCHE - SEATTLE STREETS NIGHT i2

LISA sits up front with TAYLOR while TRACY and HAROLD sit squashed
together in the cramped rear CHATTING AND LAUGHING together

LISA
This is it

3 EXT TRACY and LISAS APARTMENT BUILDING NIGHT 13

TAYLOR pulls up in front of a modern six-story brick APARTMENT
BUILDING everybody gets out TRACY and LISA hurry ahead towards
the building’s entrance while TAYLOR and HAROLD fall in behind

HAROLD
(WHISPERING)
You’ll have to handle both
of them I’m going home

TAYLOR
What

HAROLD
I can’t do it I’m not
going in there

As they reach the door TAYLOR and HAROLD hang back

TAYLOR
You cannot be serious

LISA
You boys coming in or what

TAYLOR
Yeah Go on up and do what
you gotta do We’ll be right
with you What number is it

TRACY
Sixty-eight

TAYLOR
Sixty-eight Check

The TWO GIRLS go through the door which closes behind them
TAYLOR smiles until the GIRLS are out of sight then he pounces
on the hapless HAROLD
TAYLOR
Whats the matter with you
I let you have the best one
That girl is heaven on a stick

HAROLD is already pulling away and heading home

HAROLD
That’s why I’m not going in

TAYLOR
(GOING AFTER HIM)
Come back here Don’t I
look after you on all
our adventures together
HAROLD
This is one type of adventure
I don’t do You know that

TAYLOR
Fuck the rules H

HAROLD
Fuck the rules

TAYLOR
You gotta take risks in this
life You stop taking risks
you’re dead

HAROLD
I start screwing around I’m dead

A WINDOW OPENS on the sixth (top) floor and LISA and TRACY lean
out of it Tainted Love PARTY MUSIC pumps out into the night

LISA
What the hell’s going on
down there

TAYLOR
Cool it We’re coming

LISA slips back inside but TRACY remains in the window staring
down HAROLD looks up at her she waves (hello goodbye) before
she too slips back inside the apartment

HAROLD
You’re coming I’m going Home
TAYLOR
Man we’ve got the Sex Magick
Sisters begging to fall on our
swords and you’re going home

HAROLD
I’11 call you tomorrow to run
through the equipment inventory

TAYLOR shakes his head and gives up trying to persuade Harold
to compromise himself He shrugs and turns towards the building

TAYLOR
A candycolored clown they
call the sandman --
HAROLD is walking away when he looks back one last time

And sees that instead of going in through the front door TAYLOR
is about to try to climb up the outside of the building

TAYLOR looks straight up the sheer brick facade to the GIRLS’
WINDOW the window frames are almost flush and neither are there
any pipes or other features on which to get an obvious purchase
the only possibility for a solo ascent is that the pointing on
the brickwork is recessed

TAYLOR reaches up sinks his finger- tips into a crack at the
extent of his reach and using the hard edges of his shoe soles
begins to haul his way up

Back on the sidewalk HAROLD still watching as TAYLOR has made it
past the half-way mark is approached by a plump sweaty JOGGER
out on a midnight run Seeing Harold staring upwards the JOGGER
pauses to see what he’s looking at - and stops in his tracks

JOGGER
What’s that guy doing

HAROLD
He’s feeding the rat

JOGGER
Hes doin’ what

Just then TAYLOR’S foot slips as he passes a WINDOW and he
accidentally kicks the glass He is already on his way above the
window when the curtains fly back and the WINDOW OPENS

TAYLORS POV below him an OLD LADY sticks her head out looks
around without looking up and is about to close the window when

TAYLOR VO
Boo

The OLD LADYS head jerks around and up - and she SCREAMS

HAROLDS POV as several other WINDOWS OPEN including that of a
belligerent MIDDLEAGED MAN on the floor below the girls’ window

TONY
- Hey Spiderman Whats the
big fucking idea

TAYLOR
Just visiting some friends

TONY
Why don’t you just jump back
down there and go through the
front door like everybody else

TAYLOR
Jump Down there

TONY
You heard me
TAYLOR
Fuck you man That’s a fifty
foot drop
TONY

Yeah well maybe you shoulda
thought of that before you
climbed up here

The crazed TONY disappears momentarily

JOGGER
That guy a friend of yours

HAROLD nods his head distractedly

JOGGER
He ever do this kind of
thing before

TONY reappears at the window - now toting a major HANDGUN

TONY
Now you want to jump like
a good boy or you want me
to blow your fucking head off

TAYLOR
(SHOUTING)
LISA TRACY

HAROLD
(NODDING)
Every Friday night

LISA and TRACYS WINDOW flies open and a bewildered TRACY sticks
her head out TAYLOR meantime continues to climb up towards her

TRACY
Taylor What the ---

TONY
You know this guy

TAYLOR
I’m her accountant One
two buckle my shoe --

TRACY
It’s okay Tony

TAYLOR
Three four open the door

As TAYLOR passes him on his way up TONY pulls his head in and
slams his window MUTTERING
TONY
Crazy fucking girls

Now LISA who has changed into a sexy dressing gown is at the
window too and together she and TRACY haul TAYLOR through into
their apartment

HAROLD and the JOGGER continue to watch as TAYLOR pulls both girls
to him before waving Harold goodbye - and shutting the curtains

JOGGER
What’s he do on Saturday
nights

As HAROLD CHUCKLES enigmatically
FADE TO BLACK

Then HAROLDS LAUGHTER SEQUES into the sound of a BABY CRYING-—

5iINTi HAROLDS KITCHENFAMILY ROOM DAY tt 5
Early one workday morning HAROLD sits distractedly on a sofa
holding his CRYING one year-old son ERIC who has distinctly
Asian features Summoned from the bathroom by the sound of her
baby’s distress Harold’s wife CINDY bustles into the modestly-
furnished room CINDY a feisty and wildly-attractive Japanese
American nurse Jaimie Lee Curtis in a kimono snatches ERIC up
to comfort him Floating her fingers in Harold’s face

CINDY
Hello Anyone home

HAROLD
Huh

CINDY

Baby’s crying daddy

HAROLD
Sorry I was thinking

CINDY
I don’t understand how you
can sit there with your son
screaming right in your ear
and not even notice

HAROLD
I said sorry ---

CINDY
Don’t apologize to me
HAROLD
I’m sorry Eric

CINDY
What is there so goddammed
important to think about

HAROLD
I had a flash about my work
okay I just realized something
incredibly obvious that I’ve
missed and -—

CINDY
Eric and I have been waiting
about a year for you to have
a flash about the joys of
parenthood

Picking up on the continuing tension ERIC is still erying

HAROLD
Don’t start this Cindy

CINDY
We get one hour a day of your
valuable time professor — if
we’re lucky I’m only asking
you for one hour a day - TO
THINK ABOUT US

HAROLD
Cindy

CINDY
Yes

HAROLD

My trip’s been brought

forward by a week That
— means I’11 be going the

weekend after next

ERIC is quieter now CINDY and HAROLD stare at each other for a
long pregnant moment

CINDY
Okay Harold --- I want to make
a deal with you You can be a
fuck-up as a father for ten
more days but when you get
back from this trip I want
you to promise to concentrate
on us - the three of us — for
-- for six months Okay

HAROLD
Okay - Cindy - fine --

CINDY
For six months you’re gonna
Be Here Now right No goofing
off no trips no -—-

HAROLD
But Cindy I’ve ---

CINDY
Promise me Harold I’m serious
Unless we can start acting like
a family I’m gonna have to --

HAROLD
Okay okay I promise

CINDY
You got your fingers crossed

HAROLD
My toes

CINDY comes over and kisses him and then when she’s lulled him
into a sense of false security she slips ERIC back onto his lap

CINDY
Fine Now hold Eric for five
more minutes ‘til I’m ready

6 i INT TAYLOR’S SEATTLE LAW OFFICE DAY 16

CU TAYLOR - strapped into a NAUTILUS MACHINE pouring sweat as
he pushes his body to its considerable limits It is only when
his new pa PAM KNOCKS and enters the room that we realize the
machine is set up in a corner of Taylor’s office - which commands
a stunning VIEW OF PUGET SOUND PAM is a pert pretty puritan
her immaculately coiffed hair hangs just low enough to brush the
string of pearls that glows against her cashmere sweater Pam is
not Taylor’s type and for just this reason a major challenge

PAM
Oh I’m sorry ---

Slowing his pace without altogether stopping

TAYLOR
No problem Come in

PAM
I wondered what that thing was
lL

TAYLOR
Tones the tits up a treat
You wanna try it

PAM
(PURSING HER LIPS)
Mr Glicker called Hell be
here in fifteen minutes

TAYLOR
Have we got his sworn state-
ment yet

PAM
(CHECKING A FILE)
Yes - its here

TAYLOR
What about his son’s

PAM
That’s what he wants to
talk to you about

TAYLOR nods and increases his tempo again aware that PAM is
staring at him both repelled and - despite herself - somehow
attracted Beauty and the Beast Then PAM snaps out of her
little fairy tale moment and turns to leave

TAYLOR
Pam

PAM
Uh huh

TAYLOR
Dinner tonight

PAM
What about it

TAYLOR
Have it with me

PAM
No

TAYLOR
Oh come on

PAM
I’m --- I already have a date

TAYLOR

Break it Overtime

PAM
Look Mr Tarantino ---
TAYLOR
Taylor
PAM

Thanks - Mr Tarantino but
T never shit where I eat

TAYLOR clenches at this cliched defence and jumps up two gears
As PAM is turning on her heel TAYLOR is pumping to the max

TAYLOR
I wasn’t aware - Ms Perkins -
that you shat at all

TAYLOR watches PAM’S perfect posterior exiting his office and
then the PHONE RINGS He whacks a button with his knee and
without breaking rhythm BARKS into the SPEAKERPHONE

TAYLOR
Yeah

ECU the PUPIL of an EYE rapidly opening and closing

A wider shot reveals it to be a turtle’s eyeball and optic nerve
lying in a petri dish wires running to it Beside it HAROLD
sits at an ELECTRON MICROSCOPE a KEYBOARD in his lap and a VDU
on his left Staring into the eyepiece and MUTTERING to himself

HAROLD
As was indeed expected --

He punches some data into the computer and while he waits for
the correlated information to come up on the VDU screen he hears
a VOICE in the corridor

SHERMAN V0O
Calling Dr Spike Calling
Dr Spike

SHERMAN another researcher who resembles a shorter Portnoy
sticks his head around Harolds door

SHERMAN
Dr Spike Emergency ego
otomy in the courtyard

HAROLD
Hasselbad mouthing off again

SHERMAN
You got it

HAROLD
Just one more minute here

HAROLD continues to work SHERMAN enters the room properly and
comes to look over his shoulder at what he is doing

SHERMAN
I thought you were through
fuckin’ with turtles’ eyes

HAROLD
Trenton announced he won’t put
my new grant proposal forward
until I document verifications
on everything I’ve done

SHERMAN
But -— you’re not some ditzoid
postgrad That’s gotta be --

HAROLD
Buuuuullsssssshit I know
but Trenton says it’s tight
right now

SHERMAN
It is tight - tight an’ juicy
for old Trenton

HAROLD
What do you mean

And then the PHONE RINGS - and HAROLD picks it up He cradles
the receiver between chin and shoulder and continues working

HAROLD
Yeah

CUT BETWEEN HAROLD continuing to stimulate the turtle’s eyeball
and TAYLOR still straining for pectoral perfection in his office

TAYLOR
This is your leader

HAROLD listens with interest to TAYLOR’S LABORED BREATHING
giving SHERMAN a listen too

HAROLD
Where the hell are you

TAYLOR
In my office

HAROLD
We all know you’re Mr Animal
Magnetism Taylor but do you
have to call me while you’re
screwing your secretary

TAYLOR
Nah She’s more your type H

HAROLD
I can guess What ARE you doing

TAYLOR
Im checking up on you You
done your workout yet

ANOTHER RESEARCHER now sticks his head around the door and SHOUTS
DAVE

Hey cmon you guys They’11
win by a default

HAROLD
I’m just on my way to do it
SHERMAN
We’re coming
TAYLOR

I need you fit boy

HAROLD
Yeah yeah I’m fit
(HE HANGS UP and SIGHS)
Fit enough anyway

Cheerleader SHERMAN is already leading the way out of the lab

SHERMAN
Make way for Dr Spike

DAVE has come up behind HAROLD and tweaks his nipples playfully
DAVE

Guess whos captain of the
other team

8 EXT COURTYARD OF UNIVERSITY DAY 18

SHERMAN springs into the air and pops a VOLLEY BALL off his
fingertips - making the perfect set-up for HAROLD who leaps even
higher and hammers the ball over the net for a point While
HAROLD and SHERMAN do a bit of victory hand jive OTHER SCIENTISTS
sit at lunch tables dotted around the grassy courtyard

As the game continues HAROLD finds himself across the net from
the opposing captain a striking statuesque REDHEAD whose legs
go all the way to heaven There is an attraction between them
which her flirtatiousness fosters Apart from anything else this
scene establishes Harold as a believable athlete the dialogue is
pursued in breathless snatches as the game continues punctuated
by ORDERS barked by tall blonde vain CAPTAIN HASSELBAD

HAROLD
Miss Mammogram is looking
healthy these days

SHERMAN
Must be all the exercise
she’s getting

HAROLD
What What do you know

SHERMAN
Same as everybody else -
except you I guess

HAROLD
Can’t you ever just come
straight out with it

SHERMAN
Just watch out for the
politics boy

HAROLD
I don’t want deep here
Sherman I just want to know
who she’s humpin’

SHERMAN
Trenton fool -- Trenton

HAROLD
i No shit The old bugger

SHERMAN
No shit - and Trenton only has
so many grants to go around

HAROLD
But - Trenton’s head of
research He’d never compromise
his professional integrity just
to score a little nookie

SHERMAN
Like I keep tellin’ ya Jamison
you are totally beautiful

HAROLD
You mean dumb don’t you

SHERMAN
Lesser despots than Trenton have
gone to great great lengths to
possess the charms of a perfect
10 You are vulnerable Harold
Watch your back

MISS MAMMOGRAM leaps high and thrashes one past HAROLD for a big
point Her wide white laugh swallows Harold’s hopes whole

HAROLD smiles with a new kind of fearful respect at her And if
she knows she is being talked about she revels in it

9i INT HAROLD and CINDYS BEDROOM NIGHT 9

Very late that night an exhausted HAROLD tiptoes into his
bedroom dumps his bulging briefcase on the floor and starts to
strip off his clothes Just then ERIC starts to CRY in the next
room and CINDY stirs

HAROLD
Its okay - I got him Cind

CINDY
Ohhh -- thanks darlin’

As CINDY rolls over and sinks back into slumber HAROLD smiles
wearily and goes through to Eric’s room next door

10 INT ERIC’S BEDROOM NIGHT 10

HAROLD gently lifts ERIC out of his cot and takes him on his knee
on a rocking chair ERIC immediately quietens as his father
begins to tell him a story

HAROLD
Once upon a time there was
a great castle that -- uh --
rose up like like a mighty
white tower above the land
You heard this one Me neither
So anyway this tower was an
inspiration to all the creatures
- a symbol of ---- of what it
feels like when you can just
jump past all the bullshit that
gets dumped on you in this life
You know what I’m saying Eric

11 EXT MOOSE’S TOOTH - ALASKA AFTERNOON rid

TAYLOR and HAROLD dressed in stateof-theart climbing gear stand
on a short narrow ledge a big almost sheer rock wall stretches
up and away to their left below and beyond which is an awesome
vista of glacier and distant peaks They organize their ropes
TAYLOR is going to lead on this pitch

HAROLD
Remember two pitons or
less to take the record

TAYLOR
I told ya H this is now a
zero piton wall Im gonna
dyno the whole pitch which
will make it forever mine

HAROLD
What I love about you is you’re
too dumb to let reality stand
in the way of success

TAYLOR
(SEEING SOMETHING)
Gimme your glasses

HAROLD hands him BINOCULARS and TAYLOR looks up to where

At the furthest extent of its upward sweep the wall curves out
to form a dramatic overhang under which SIX BRIGHTLYDRESSED
CLIMBERS hang in nightslings which sway slightly in the wind

TAYLOR
(HANDING BACK THE GLASSES)
You believe this

HAROLD
What are they doing

i TAYLOR
Must be some kind of ninja
cult Ready

HAROLD nods and TAYLOR unsnaps himself and moves out onto the
face Like a spider his arms and legs stretched at bizarre
angles digging his fingers into small eracks gripping the
tiniest protrusions he moves slowly out and up across the big
wall Several times he has to “dyno — leap off the wall to grab
another hold farther up - hanging by one hand until he can find
points of purchase for his other hand and for his feet

While HAROLD waits on the ledge maintaining a rather academic
belay TAYLOR climbs steadily up towards the watching CLIMBERS
whose faces are smeared with zine oxide

Closest to Taylor is Japanese-American TAKANE SHIMUZU his broad
Samurai face burnt black Next to him is PHILLIP CLAYBORN the
oldest member and leader of the party And beside him the four
others the blue—blooded DALLAS WOOLF doughty JACK METCALFE and
finally the twin brothers and youngest members MIKE and TODD
WILSON They all sit holding steaming tin mugs while next to
TAKANE a polished METAL ORB like some futuristic kitchen device
seems to be growing right out of the wall This too is steaming

TAKANE
Hi

TAYLOR

(TAKING IT ALL IN)

Hi

TAKANE
Coffee

TAYLOR

Oh I figured sake
At this point CLAYBORN removes his glare goggles and smiles

CLAYBORN
Hello Tarantino Nice moves

TAYLOR
Clayborn
(EYEING THE ORB)
Well I always figured if
someone was gonna invent the
personal nuclear reactor it
was gonna have to be you

TAYLOR has by now moved across and below the six hanging climbers
to the end of the pitch which is a narrow vertical crack that
runs fifty feet up to the next area of horizontal purchase While
CLAYBORN does the introductions TAYLOR deftly climbs the crack
until he is at the same height as the other climbers and only
ten or fifteen feet along from them While he then prepares to
drive in a CHOKSTONE in order to belay HAROLD for his move across
the face TAKANE passes a strange-looking hi-tech PITON along the
line to TODD who tosses it to TAYLOR

TAYLOR
What’s this

CLAYBORN
We’re testing some new
equipment

TAKANE

It’s a gas powered self-
driving piton Saves a lot
of energy at high altitude

TAYLOR
(EXAMINING IT)
I hate to tell you but were
only ten thousand feet here

CLAYBORN
Like I said - this is just a
test run

TAYLOR shrugs positions the PITON and pulls the grenade-like
ring There is an EXPLOSION of dust and the piton drives itself
solidly home into the rock TAYLOR nods impressed and clips the
rope linking him to Harold onto the piton He tugs it twice asa
signal then takes the tension for his climbing partner

FAR BELOW HAROLD sets out on his upward traverse

TAYLOR
Test run for what

CLAYBORN
Id rather not say until
we’ve got the permissions

TAKANE
You going to the top

TAYLOR
Yeah well we got a little
rehearsal going ourselves here
We’re coming back in a month to
shoot for the record on McKinley

DALLAS
The summit speed record

TAYLOR nods nonchalantly as he pays attention to HAROLDS
progress

CLAYBORN
You think you can beat
three and a half days
Who else you taking

DALLAS
Superman

TAYLOR
Just Harold and me --—

The SIX CLIMBERS look at each other doubtfully
TAYLOR

plus a couple of our
favorite hookers

Everyone LAUGHS - except the aloof patrician DALLAS who seems
to have conceived an immediate and violent antipathy to Taylor

DALLAS
Harold who

TAYLOR
Harold Jamison

DALLAS
Never heard of him

TAYLOR
Here he comes we can ask

him he’s ever heard of you

TAKANE
You going on up tonight

TAYLOR
(CHECKS HIS WATCH)
Nah think we’ll save it
for tomorrow

CLAYBORN
We’re going to make camp just
above us here Perhaps you’d
like to join us for the night

TAYLOR watches HAROLD making good progress below him
TAYLOR

Why not What time do you

chopper in the sushi

At this moment HAROLD who is almost directly below TAYLOR now
tries one last dyno - and misses his mark Taylor’s efficient
belay means that he merely swings across the vertical in a harm—
less arc until he can find enough purchase to stop his momentum
TAYLOR notices that DALLAS snorts derisively at this mistake

12 EXT MOOSE’S TOOTH BASE CAMP LATE AFTERNOON 312

The EIGHT CLIMBERS make their way around a bluff on the ICE LEDGE
above the rock wall The TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN covered in deep
snow towers steeply right above them As they round the bluff
they come to a narrow acceptably-level area on the steep ice and
snow slope
CLAYBORN
This is about the angle of
ice they need to function on

TAKANE
Right

The SIX MAN EXPEDITION immediately drop their packs and begin to
strip out TWO TENTS one large one small - which they clearly
intend to pitch just here

TAYLOR and HAROLD look up at the mountain and then at each other

HAROLD
Er ---

TAYLOR
You guys arent stopping
here are you

DALLAS
I’m stopping here

CLAYBORN
We need to test these tents
on some steep ice

TAYLOR
I heard you - but this is
really a col we’re in here

Some irritated looks are exchanged

DALLAS
Catch me I think I’m gonna
faint

CLAYBORN

(HELPING WITH A TENT)
It’s almost July Im sure
everything that’s gonna come
down has already done it

JACK
See all those choppy formations
There was an avalanche here just
a week or two ago party’s
already over

HAROLD
Yeah but -— we heard they had
pretty heavy snow here this year

There is an uncomfortable silence during which DALLAS pointedly
continues his work on one of the tents

TAYLOR
I think Harold’s just suggesting
we get out of a slide area

The short-fused DALLAS instantly surrenders to a sudden and
irrational rage

DALLAS
Listen why don’t you two just
go down past that ridge on the
right and make your camp there
Well see you in the morning
How’s that sound

TAYLOR and HAROLD look at each other for a long moment

HAROLD
Yeah that’s probably the best
idea See you in the morning

TAYLOR
‘Course if you guys decide to
go for a real early start dont
forget to give us a shout

DALLAS HOWLS like a wolf the OTHERS MUTTER goodnight - and
CLAYBORN makes a little conciliatory hand signal

As TAYLOR and HAROLD turn and trudge away

HAROLD
Old friend

TAYLOR
(SHAKING HIS HEAD)
New enemy One of my
particular talents

HAROLD
What about Clayborn

TAYLOR
Real estate tycoon He’s the
Donald Trump of the North West

HAROLD
You climbed with him

TAYLOR
(SHAKING HIS HEAD AGAIN)
Weve done some work for
him I see him in the
Club in Seattle sometimes

HAROLD
Seems like a nice guy

TAYLOR
Nice How many billionaires
do you know H

13 INT HAROLD and TAYLORS TENT NIGHT i413

As they lie back in their SLEEPING BAGS the GAS LAMP still
burning listening to the big country silence around them

TAYLOR
Ready for a big one tomorrow

HAROLD
Yeah - I’m feeling real good

TAYLOR
Youll feel even better when
we’ve knocked off McKinley
Then youll be ready for your
first eight-thousander

HAROLD
Er — Taylor

TAYLOR
Y-e-e-e-s

HAROLD

I got a little problem about
this McKinley trip

TAYLOR
Oh lemme guess It’s about
5’4 straight black hair ---

HAROLD
I been working too hard see
and I promised her — she made
me promise her - that Id ---

TAYLOR
I only need to borrow you for
ten days for chrissakes

HAROLD
TI really don’t think I can
make another trip this year

TAYLOR
T’1ll go talk to her

HAROLD
Thatll only make it worse

TAYLOR
(HIS OLD MAN’ VOICE)
Remember those conversations we
used to have in the olden days
about The Way of the Warrior

HAROLD
The Way of the Warrior — lemme
tell you O Innocent One — does
not stand a chance against the
Way of the Wife

As TAYLOR LAUGHS we hear outside a large snowslide WHOOMPING
down somewhere not a million miles away

TAYLOR
Wanna have a little side bet
on some serious white dumping
on those fuckers tonight

HAROLD
Pass Sounds karmically uncool

TAYLOR
Bullshit We gave them a shot
at sanity They blew it

HAROLD freezes for a moment as though listening to an inner
voice

Then he suddenly starts getting out of his sleeping bag and
finding his clothes

TAYLOR
Where are you going

HAROLD
Little walk Go to sleep

TAYLOR
Let’s see now - High

altitude euphoria No Protein
deficiency I don’t think so
Not yet Hereditary insanity

HAROLD
7 Just - go to sleep okay

HAROLD drags on his overclothes and leaves the tent

14 EXT MOOSE’S TOOTH NIGHT 114

HAROLD picks up a long COIL OF ROPE ties one end securely toa
loop on their tent and heads back up the stark moonlit ridge
towards the other tents Paying out rope as he goes

The first tent he reaches is the LARGE ONE the light is off but
there are still muffled VOICES coming from inside Very quietly
HAROLD knots the end of his rope through a tie loop on the tent

Then HAROLD looks across towards the SMALLER TENT in which a
LIGHT still burns He wonders what to do since he only brought
one length of rope He approaches the tent and sees a coil of
rope resting against the front flap Very gently he reaches down
and begins to ease the rope away from the tent when suddenly
the tent flap unzips and whips back and HAROLD is eyeball to
eyeball with the suspicious TODD WILSON

TODD
You What the fuck are you
doing

HAROLD
I’m --- I was going to -

attach your tent to the big
one See I -—

Now MIKE is staring out at HAROLD too both twins clearly think
their visitor is completely cracked

MIKE
Did Clayborn put you up to
this

HAROLD
No

The TWINS look at each other TODD snatches the coil of rope out
of Harold’s hand and zips the tent back up in his face

HAROLD
I was just worried -- about
an avalanche

TODD V0

Sure you were ‘Night dad

The LIGHT in the twins’ tent goes out and HAROLD now feeling a
complete fool shrugs and heads slowly back to his tent

15 EXT MOOSE’S TOOTH SKYSCAPE DAWN 115

High above the mountain in the brilliant early sky a MILITARY
JET FIGHTER crashes the sound barrier Moments later we hear the
SONIC BOOM and a second after that a section of the summit snow
cap breaks away and starts an AVALANCHE

A RUMBLING ECHO in the distance as the avalanche gains momentum
The AVALANCHE sweeps down burying Clayborn’s TWO TENTS and

sweeping them further down the mountain towards the precipice
above the rock wall The ROPE linking the two tents snaps taut

20 INT SNOW CAVE DAY 20

TWENTY MINUTES LATER HAROLD and TAYLOR have tunnelled a number of
yards into the mound of snow when they come to the first sight of
the BIG TENT HAROLD clears away more snow with his hands then
uses his ice axe to rip a hole in the tent which incredibly has
retained some of its structure

INSIDE THE TENT we see a jumble of BODIES HAROLD grabs the
nearest head TAKANE’S whose eyes register shock and relief

HAROLD
Hey

TAKANE
Hey Thanks God --

HAROLD shines a PENLIGHT into the pile of bodies

HAROLD
Everybody else okay

After weak ACKNOWLEDGMENTS HAROLD and TAYLOR help all FOUR MEN
struggle out of the tent and down the tunnel towards the light

The four rescued CLIMBERS stand beyond the avalanche site
exercising life back into cramped limbs CLAYBORN in his shock is
grasping a piece of his hi-tech EQUIPMENT as a kind of talisman

CLAYBORN
How did you find us

TAYLOR picks up the ROPE which leads from his and Harold’s tent
into the snow cave

CLAYBORN
Your idea
TAYLOR
Harold’s
CLAYBORN

What about the other tent

(TAYLOR SHAKES HIS HEAD)
We better start digging
Mark Jack

Meanwhile HAROLD is standing on the edge of the precipice
looking down the thousand foot drop to the glacier below

HAROLD
Hey Look

HAROLD’S POV some of the avalanche has gone over the edge and
dashed itself to powder on the moraine at the foot of the rock
wall Just visible amidst the windblown debris is a fluttering
rag of the bright RED FABRIC that was the twins’ tent

HAROLD turns away from the edge distraught just as TAYLOR and
CLAYBORN rush up to look over for themselves While CLAYBORN
throws the useless piece of equipment over the edge

TAYLOR goes to comfort HAROLD who is close to tears

22 INT ALPINE CLUB - SEATTLE DAY 22

In the LOUNGE of the ALPINE CLUB with its atmosphere of the
tradition of pioneering in this prime wilderness region of the
USA PHOTOGRAPHS of intrepid climbers line the woodpanelled
walls In the doorway we see two grizzled summit VETERANS greet
each other with some arcane privatejoke hand signal then they
immediately fall to reminiscing about some high altitude epic

Meanwhile TAYLOR sits with CLAYBORN over a drink While the older
man looks very business-like in his rather severe suit TAYLOR
dresses as usual more flamboyantly

TAYLOR
I guess it leaves kind
of a hole in your team

CLAYBORN deflects this challenge with his best poker face

TAYLOR
Got anyone in mind to fill it

CLAYBORN
You’re volunteering huh

TAYLOR
Depends on where youre going

CLAYBORN
Could be just about anywhere

TAYLOR
Waiting for permission means
the Himalayas

CLAYBORN
Not necessarily We might be
going ski trekking in the Urals

TAYLOR
Oh come on Clayborn it’s one
of the big ones You wouldnt
be in it otherwise

CLAYBORN gazes noncommittally out the window at one of his
mirror-glass SCRAPERS that towers above them

CLAYBORN
I never talk about a deal
until it’s signed

TAYLOR
Is it Everest
(NO REACTION)
The Karakoram

CLAYBORN
(TAYLOR IS VERY WARM)
What concern is it of yours

TAYLOR
I’m the best climber I know
who’s never been over 8000m

CLAYBORN
So whats stopping you

TAYLOR
The big ones take time Ive
never given myself that time
But Im not getting any younger
here and this just seems right

CLAYBORN
You haven’t told me WHY I should
take you and --— and your friend
TAYLOR

His name’s Harold Jamison and
he saved your life goddammit

CLAYBORN
That’s not a reason to take
him Or you

TAYLOR
I’ve climbed with Harold fifteen
years We’re good together and
were hungry You need two guys
Why NOT take us

CLAYBORN
Maybe I just don’t like having
my decisions made for me

TAYLOR
When are you leaving

CLAYBORN
Three weeks

TAYLOR
For how long

CLAYBORN
For as long as it takes

TAYLOR
Maybe this decision is making
itself Who else is on the list

CLAYBORN
(BEAT)
What’s your problem with Dallas
Woolf
TAYLOR

Ask him what’s his with me

CLAYBORN
I already did I just don’t
need to be responsible for the
first murder at 28000 feet

TAYLOR
It’s K2 isn’t it

Touche CLAYBORN tries to brazen it out but now TAYLOR knows
this is the destination

TAYLOR
Isn’t it

CLAYBORN
T’1l put it to the other
members of the team

TAYLOR
It’s your team You can make
the decision right here

CLAYBORN
(STANDING)
The only decision I’m prepared
to make right here is no

TAYLOR finally drops his case for an instant verdict and stands

TAYLOR
I want to climb K2 more than
anything in the world It’s been
my dream for ever Phillip

CLAYBORN
Mine too Taylor
(SHAKING HANDS)
I’11l cail you

23 INT i ANTECHAMBER CORRIDOR IN SEATTLE COURTHOUSE DAY 23

While his young assistant WALKER shuffles papers TAYLOR paces
around the GLICKERS SENIOR and JUNIOR who sit at a cheap table in
a small bare room with a glass door panel - through which we see
COURT OFFICIALS LAWYERS WITNESSES etc bustling about OUTSIDE

An angry TAYLOR waves a piece of PAPER in the air as the two
frightened men shift awkwardly in their seats These wouldbe
mafiosi have the air of over-ambitious losers who have been
burned at both ends in some sordid underworld embroglio

TAYLOR

How come this is the first
I know about this

(SNR GLARES AT JNR)
What’d I say when you jerkoff
snuff-junkies begged me to take
the case Huh I said you gotta

GLICKER SNR

TAYLOR
How dumb are you This is
proof you had the guy offed

GLICKER JNR
That was just like - a joke

TAYLOR

a guy mean writing it down and
fucking signing it

GLICKER JNR

chrissakes

GLICKER SNR

GLICKER SNR

TAYLOR looks at WALKER smiles shakes his head and spins the
piece of paper onto the table in front of the sweating hoods

TAYLOR

GLICKER SNR

it to TAYLOR who listens his smile broadening

TAYLOR

TAYLOR excitedly hands the phone back to WALKER and gestures to
him that they’re out of there WALKER shrugs and starts stuffing
papers back into a briefcase

GLICKER SNR

GLICKER SNR

TAYLOR and WALKER are half-way out the door now the irate older
GLICKER following them into the CORRIDOR

TAYLOR
The amount of money youd need
to keep me in this room I
haven’t heard about

OUT IN THE CORRIDOR now watched by COURT VISITORS the desperate
GLICKER grabs TAYLOR by the throat

GLICKER SNR
You’re my attorney goddammit
You can’t dump me in it like
this You crazy

TAYLOR impassively looks down at GLICKER’S hands around his
throat then glances up at a concerned POLICE OFFICER coming
down the corridor towards him

OFFICER
Okay Taylor

TAYLOR
Take this boy to Court Four
will you Barney Excitement
seems to be getting to him

BARNEY grabs GLICKER SNR and starts to haul him off down the
corridor GLICKER SCREAMS after the departing TAYLOR

GLICKER SNR
I’1l find you you fuck I’11

my fucking pit bulls

GLICKER is trying to pull away from BARNEY who is now helped by
TWO OTHER COPS in trying to subdue the crazed gangster --- while
TAYLOR makes his exit

HAROLD

Just as the exasperated HAROLD is chasing TAYLOR out of the room
SHERMAN enters looking for his colleague

SHERMAN
Who’s this guy

HAROLD
My bete noir

TAYLOR

I’m the best fucking friend
you ever had H and one day
I’m going to hear it from you

25 INT OUTSIDE TRENTON’S OFFICE DAY 125

TAYLOR is about to barge straight through Trenton’s door which
also has a glass panel in it when HAROLD grabs his arm

HAROLD
Wait Look

IN TRENTON’S OFFICE TRENTON sits at his desk while our favorite
femme fatale lays out a series of large format MAGNETIC RESONANCE
IMAGES high-definition color x-rays - on a LIGHTBOX

TAYLOR
(WHISPERING)
Who is that

HAROLD
Miss Mammogram I told you -

TAYLOR
Shes looking for a grant
How much does she need
Ill give it to her

HAROLD

it to her

Then before HAROLD can restrain TAYLOR he KNOCKS on Trenton’s
door and enters the office HAROLD following him in an attempt
at damage limitation TRENTON and the REDHEAD look up in surprise

TRENTON
Harold What Who is this
TAYLOR
Taylor Tarantino I’m Harold’s
attorney
HAROLD
Taylor
TRENTON
Yes
TAYLOR

Sorry to barge in Professor
My idea We need an answer
on Harold’s grant

TRENTON looks daggers at HAROLD then
TRENTON

Will you excuse us Ms Kurstow
This wont take a minute

The REDHEAD smiles and leaves the room TAYLOR’S eyes following
her When she has gone

TRENTON
Now what the hell is this
all about

TAYLOR
I need Harold’s participation
in something very important on
the twenty-third I figure you’ve
already decided about his grant so
is he going to get it or not

TRENTON
How did you get past my secretary

TAYLOR
Same way I get past all bullshit
I jump over it Now come on —- we’re
talking about Harolds future here
What’s it going to be

TRENTON is standing now He picks up a copy of HAROLD’S THESIS
CU HAROLD’S NAME on the cover flicks through it and dumps it
wistfully back on the desk

Now TAYLOR picks it up and examines it

TRENTON
This is a good piece of work
Harold A very good piece of
work Better than the study
that clinched my professorship
I should say -— what we call
pure research Mr Tarantino

TAYLOR looks at HAROLD significantly

TRENTON
But that was twenty years ago
When there was such a thing
as a free lunch in these dumps

Now TRENTON is handling some of the Redhead’s MR IMAGES

TRENTON
These Magnetic Resonance
Images of Ms Kurstow’s are
examples of applied research
The university is negotiating
an R and D contract for this
technology with -- a large
company worth up to a hundred
million dollars to us over the
next ten years

HAROLD
So the answer’s no

TRENTON
Very reluctantly I have no
choice Harold

HAROLD
But without pure research
youve got nothing to apply

TRENTON
This is a small faculty We
are not well endowed We have
to be realistic

HAROLD
I call it short-sighted You
want me to do an appendix on
future applications of my work

TRENTON
You came in here demanding an
immediate answer You’ve got it
(INTO INTERCOM)
Ms Kurstow may come back in now
(TO HAROLD )
You’re one of the best research
scientists I know Harold Ill
give you all the help I can to
find another posting Im sorry

MS KURSTOW reenters the office She smiles at HAROLD with a sad
serene inevitability - like a scientist looking at a beautiful-
but-doomed dinosaur She offers hima no hard feelings hand-
shake but TAYLOR grabs HAROLD’S arm and pulls him to the door

TAYLOR

Come on H we’re out of here
Thanks Trenton

26 INTEXT SEATTLE STREETS EVENING 26

THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN OF TAYLORS PORSCHE we see TAYLOR and
HAROLD talking mute as they drive down quiet suburban streets
past MEN watering lawns after work KIDS playing basketball
against garage doors WOMEN cooking dinner in brightly-lit
kitchens with the TV on for company Then

HAROLD
It’s a matter of perception

TAYLOR
It’s a matter of evolution

As they enter HAROLDS STREET

TAYLOR
Look out here -- you see people
happy at home with their families
- I see people who’ve given up
fighting for existence Thats
what I call living dangerously

27 INTEXT TAYLORS PORSCHE OUTSIDE HAROLD’S HOUSE EVENING 27

As TAYLOR pulls up outside HAROLD’S HOUSE

TAYLOR

HAROLD looks at the lighted windows of his home

HAROLD
One thing Im still capable

TAYLOR
So I can call Clayborn

HAROLD
(BEAT) Yeah Call him

TAYLOR
You sure you don’t want me to
wait Til you’ve talked it over

HAROLD
Get out of here

They do their blood brothers handshake HAROLD gets out of the
car and treads heavily up the path to his front door

28 INT HAROLD and CINDY’S LIVING ROOM NIGHT 28

HAROLD enters the living room to see a delighted ERIC crawling
quickly across the floor towards him and CINDY still in her
uniform just beginning to prepare dinner

HAROLD
Hi Eric Hi Cind

He picks ERIC up and then goes to kiss CINDY She seems relaxed
happy and very pleased to see him

CINDY
Hello darling Good day

HAROLD
Er - fine You started on

CINDY
Oh Really Sure - that’d be
neat Ill go change

HAROLD

CINDY winks at him and leads the way into their bedroom

29 INT HAROLD and CINDY’S BEDROOM NIGHT 129

CINDY wearing only bra and panties stands making herself up in
the big mirror that faces the foot of their double bed on which
she can see HAROLD playing rough and tumble with ERIC

CINDY
Where we gonna go

HAROLD
Your choice

CINDY

How about the Vietnamese
They’re great with Eric

HAROLD
Vietnamese Fine

CINDY has just started applying her lipstick when she happens to
glance at her husband and there is something about the wistful
expression on his face as he plays with his son that stops her in
midstroke

- CINDY
What is it H
HAROLD
Huh
CINDY

Something’s wrong

HAROLD
Nothing’s wrong

CINDY pauses another moment before going back to her makeup

30 INT HAROLD and CINDY’S BEDROOM NIGHT 30

MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT HAROLD and CINDY are lying naked under a
sheet in the dark when ERIC makes a small NOISE from his cot in
the adjoining room CINDY is asleep but HAROLD is wide awake and
is about to get out of bed when ERIC quietens again

HAROLD lies on his back with his eyes open now clearly tense He
turns away from CINDY onto his side and is about to slip out of
bed when CINDY stirs

CINDY
What is it H

HAROLD
Can’t sleep

CINDY
Why not

HAROLD
Dunno

CINDY

raging naked around the room in the near
the bed on Harold’s side is a BOOKSHELF

on

which are a number of books mostly about mountain climbing She

grabs several of them up cracks them open rips pages out

CINDY
I’ve looked at these books H
“Savage Mountain -— Killer

HAROLD
Cindy shut up and listen
CINDY
You want to blow five years

The grain of truth in this stings HAROLD hard and he bangs his
raging woman against the wall stunning her momentarily

HAROLD

this mountain for ME

CINDY
ME-MEME-ME--MEME-ME-ME-ME—ME
HAROLD

having pounded her HAROLD wants the punishment

HAROLD
Everythings falling apart

CINDY is SCREAMING HAROLD chases her round the room and grabs

they fight then they fuck

IN THE NEXT ROOM ERIC listens to the new SOUNDS with interest

31 EXT SEATTLE AIRPORT DAY i 31

CU ERIC’S little face through the back-window of his parents’
car as he watches

ERIC’S POV the line of MEN’S FACES lining the curved DEPARTURE
RAMP as the car is about to pull away Beside his father is
TAYLOR His mother who is driving the car stares at TAYLOR as
she starts the car a look that says something passed between
these two people once that had nothing to do with Harold

As the CAR PULLS AWAY HAROLD watches ERIC’S uncomprehending face
vanishing

32 INT FIRST CLASS SECTION OF 747 NIGHT 132

CU HAROLDS FACE reflected on the inside of a PLANE WINDOW as he
looks out at the high altitude CLOUDS

HAROLD looks back across the aisle TAKANE lies back listening to
a Dwight Yokum tape on his WALKMAN Beside him JACK METCALFE
painstakingly checks through lists of expedition equipment In
the window seat in front of JACK sits CLAYBORN in his half-—frame
glasses reading some weighty historical tome which he annotates
with an expensive propelling pencil

A little further forward TAYLOR stands in the aisle chatting up
JODI the STEWARDESS he already has her GIGGLING

TAYLOR
Really - the point of all
this is for the six of us to
join the five mile high club
(JODI GIGGLES AGAIN)
You a member

JODI
No
TAYLOR
Come on — you can tell me
JODI
I did I’m not
TAYLOR
Well — wanna do something

about it
Now JODI is a brave girl but not that brave

JODI
Youre too much you know

TAYLOR
No - come on This is first
class isn’t it Help me out
here

CLAYBORN is watching now thin lipped when DALLAS comes back
down the aisle from the toilets and sees the repulsively rampant
TAYLOR on the make A disapproving look immediately clouds his
face and as he passes TAYLOR he purposely bumps him hard

DALLAS
Sorry if our mascot is giving
you a hard time Miss

JODI
No problem

DALLAS
He gets altitude sickness see
and he just can’t help himself

While TAYLOR mimes vomiting over DALLAS and the two men relapse
into an angry standoff JODI takes the chance to slip away

CLAYBORN
Dallas

TAYLOR
Thanks buddy owe you one

DALLAS
Don’t mention it

As DALLAS goes to slip back into his seat beside CLAYBORN TAYLOR
passes behind him and knocks him so hard that he falls clumsily
across their leader who drops his book on the floor

CLAYBORN
Will you two knock it off

TAYLOR turns and makes a flamboyantly innocent “Who me gesture
before collapsing in the aisle seat beside HAROLD

HAROLD
I thought you were already
a member

TAYLOR
You get addicted you know

33 EXT 3 K2 MOTEL - SKARDU NORTHERN PAKISTAN DAY 33

The TONS AND TONS OF EQUIPMENT are laid out in brightlycolored
piles in front of the billboardsigned K2 MOTEL

While some of the expedition TEAM MEMBERS work at packing the
mountain of gear into porter-sized loads and JACK directs a
group of PAKISTANIS who load a number of finished packs onto FOUR
heavily-decorated TRUCKS CLAYBORN counts out sackfuls of low-
denominationrupee notes

Around them CROWDS of curious PAKISTANIS mill the women in
bright saris HAROLD hands out handfuls of BIROS to the gaggle of
SHRIEKING filthy CHILDREN

We also notice the expedition’s army-attache Liaison Officer
MALIK negotiating with the shifty IBRAHIM the head porter and
Urdu-Balti translator (sirdar)

Beyond this hectic scene the long valley entirely ringed by the
outlying whitecapped peaks of the Karakoram is also white but
it is the whiteness of sand not snow The effect is very eerie
and very beautiful

34 EXTINT KARAKORAM HIGHWAY DAY 34

TWO MINI-BUSES and FOUR garishly-painted TRUCKS top-heavy with
their loads of freight groan s--lo-w-ly up a very bad road in a
beautiful mountain valley

Blaring Pakistani POP MUSIC the convoy passes a SIGN which says
KARAKORAM HIGHWAY

IN THE CABIN OF ONE OF THE BUSES HAROLD trying to hold his
CAMERA steady is squashed between MALIK and the DRIVER who chain-
smokes filthy K2 cigarettes As they plough through another bone-
shaking pothole HAROLD looks out the window to see a large
roadside BILLBOARD advertising Coca Cola It says Have a Cock

35i INTEXT i KARAKORAM HIGHWAY EVENING 135

The convoy makes its way carefully over a wooden SUSPENSION
BRIDGE Far below a rock-strewn RIVER

TAYLOR rides for a change on top of one of the lorry loads along
with several PAKISTANI HITCHHIKERS who pass around a chillum

As his lorry passes over the bridge and turns up yet another

steep incline it passes another BILLBOARD stating The Icy
Finger of Death Points at the Speed King”

36 INTEXT DASSO VILLAGE LATE AFTERNOON 36

Ringed by very high snow-capped peaks DASSO is the end of the
road literally as far as the vehicles can go As the CONVOY
enters the picturesque but desperately poor village made of mud-
brick and thatch all the VILLAGERS gap-toothed barefoot men
veiled women and filthy naked children - turn out to line the
road and stare at the strangers The village is surrounded by
vivid green agricultural terraces ploughed by Yaks and won from
the harsh terrain by generations of skilled hard labor

The CONVOY lurches towards a large flat area just beyond the
village where hundreds of local MEN and BOYS gather around many
small open FIRES They look up expectantly as the vehicles stop a
hundred yards away

IN THE CABIN OF THE LEAD BUS

HAROLD
Jesus

MALIK
Our porters

MALIK SHOUTS something to the driver and points

The SIX EXPEDITION VEHICLES form a circle wagon-train style on
a flat area of ground near the porters’ camp

37 EXT DASSO CAMP SUNSET 137

The climbers’ camp established CLAYBORN MALIK and IBRAHIM conduct
a noisy negotiation with representatives of the PORTERS the rest
of whom take the opportunity to pray hundreds of them kneel in
the dust facing Mecca

TAYLOR finds a FRISBEE in his pack and tosses it to HAROLD He
in turn tosses it to TAKANE who tries an ambitious blind whip to
DALLAS This eludes him arcing around to hit one of the praying
PORTERS on the bottom the astonished man leaps up in alarm as
though Allah himself had kicked his ass Other porters hoot with
LAUGHTER one of them grabs the fluorescent disk and soon there
is a full-on EastWest frisbee freefor—all in the dusty camp

Meanwhile CLAYBORN is still negotiating He speaks to MALIK
about their sirdar IBRAHIM who cannot understand English

CLAYBORN
Ask him if this deal is
going to stick

MALIK and IBRAHIM have a brief exchange in URDU

MALIK
Yes yes — he says no problem

CLAYBORN
Tell him there better not be

MALIK MUTTERS something

CLAYBORN
Tell him if there’s a strike
he will not get paid
a (MALIK HESITATES)
Go on tell him

MALIK MUTITERS again unconvincingly and then IBRAHIM nods and
withdraws

CLAYBORN
He’s the best sirdar you could
find

MALIK
Yes sir

CLAYBORN

IT dont trust him

MALIK
He is very well respected by
the men here

CLAYBORN
Just as long as he understands
that he’s working for us and
not them

38 EXT DASSO-ASKOLE TRAIL MONTAGE DAY and NIGHT 38

MONTAGE of the three day march between DASSO and ASKOLE - the last
inhabited place before the mountain We see the whole procession
of two hundred men strung out along precarious mountain paths
fording raging streams hiking through driving rain and passing
through everpoorer and smaller villages

In one VILLAGE we see HAROLD acting as team doctor inspecting
and dispensing colored pills to a long queue of poorly-nourished
and even deformed VILLAGERS We also see a bitter mute argument
between CLAYBORN MALIK IBRAHIM and a number of the PORTERS

On one long ascent we get a hint of competitiveness between
DALLAS and TAYLOR about their respective hiking speeds these two
clearly see themselves as the two lead climbers of the party

39 i EXT APPROACHING ASKOLE EVENING 39

The last majestic slope up into ASKOLE another timeless MUD
VILLAGE surrounded by emerald terraces and soaring white peaks

THE TWO HUNDRED PORTERS make a long weary line as they hurry
towards the evening’s camp

TAYLOR slips past the shattered HAROLD on the trail their PACKS
towering over their heads

’

TAYLOR
How you feeling H

HAROLD
I’1l sleep tonight man
I’1l tell you that

TAYLOR
Acclimatizing okay

HAROLD
Is it good news or bad news
when you bleed from the ears

Up ahead ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ASKOLE the lead PORTERS stop
either side of the trail to watch another descending EXPEDITION

We hear CLINKING of karabiners and crampons as HAROLD and TAYLOR
push their way to the front of the SILENT CROWD

The DESCENDING EXPEDITION is a SIXMAN GERMAN CLIMBING PARTY
They are accompanied by a small group of BALTI PORTERS four of
whom carry a STRING BED on which is the body of ANOTHER MAN
Bringing up the rear is a pretty distracted-looking young
ITALIAN WOMAN They all look like theyve been through hell

While the AMERICANS break through the crowd and collect around
the strangers the PORTERS put the BED down in the middle of the
trail and the YOUNG WOMAN immediately sits on it and strokes the
sick man’s forehead

STEINER

Helmut Steiner -- were just
from Mustagh Tower — the
weather was too bad We had
to come down very quickly

(SMILING WEAKLY)
Do you have any food you
could spare

While CLAYBORN nods ‘of course’ HAROLD looks at the sick man
moves forward and squats down to check on his condition He
checks the man’s pulse eyes etc and while the woman continues
to MURMUR to her husband in Italian withdraws to the main group

HAROLD
He’s dead

STEINER
Her brother too but she wont
believe it They were climbing
on Paiyu We try to bury him
but she doesn’t agree

They all watch the young widow grieving in her own way as the
last LIGHT FADES from the surrounding snowcaps

40 INT LAMBARDARS HOUSE - ASKOLE EVENING 40

The village headman’s house is larger but by no means more
luxurious than the other mud and thatch hovels in Askole The
MEMBERS OF BOTH CLIMBING PARTIES plus MALIK and IBRAHIM are
gathered in the main room where they play nervously with special
guest-sized cups of oily yak-butter tea

HAROLD almost at the back of the group looks down a huge HOLE
in the middle of the floor through which thick SMOKE billows

In the sulphurous gloom below them HAROLD is amazed to see
WOMEN CHILDREN and ANIMALS moving around a cooking fire

Behind HAROLD next to the main entrance TAYLOR chats quietly
and respectfully - in ITALIAN with the teary young WOMAN

Back in the main group the diplomatic DALLAS is doing best of
all with the revolting yak-butter cocktails when he spots TAYLOR
apparently woolfing the widow and subtly draws CLAYBORNS
attention to it He then makes a derogatory comment to TAKANE

TAYLOR notices this bait but continues to talk to the WOMAN in
exactly the same manner even going so far as to touch her sleeve
in a gesture of sympathy

DALLAS takes a step forward and makes another comment still
inaudible TAYLOR continues to ignore him now the grieving WIDOW
is swooning provocatively on his shoulder

CLAYBORN watches the prelude to the shootout nervously but the
LAMBARDAR has him well and truly boxed in he only gets to hold a
party once a year and he intends to make the most of it

Then DALLAS - who affects the code of conduct of a Southern
Gentleman circa Scarlett O’Hara and thinks he knows a cad when he
sees one can stand it no longer
DALLAS
Taylor

TAYLOR nods a moment please -— in fact he has been conducting
himself with perfect Etruscan decorum excuses himself further
with a soft familiar PHRASE and goes to meet his match

TAYLOR
Yeah

DALLAS
What the hell do you think
you’re doing

TAYLOR
I’m talking to Signora Giustetta

DALLAS
You’re scum

TAYLOR looks back at the WOMAN and remembers his best behavior

TAYLOR
My mother comes from her city

DALLAS
(STEPPING CLOSER)
You are a twisted low-life
pervert

TAYLOR
I take that as a compliment

DALLAS
What’s five mile high club
in Italian

TAYLOR
What is this Harvard Trivial
Pursuits

DALLAS
She’s pregnant right That’s
your thing - pregnant widows

TAYLOR looks again at SIGNORA GIUSTETTA then politely beckons
DALLAS over as if to talk to her When DALLAS buys it and steps
up TAYLOR instead grabs him and pulls him straight through the
open doorway and into the village street

CLAYBORN notices all this and signals diplomatic alarm TAKANE
intercepts the signal and is the first to move

41 EXT LAMBARDAR’S HOUSEASKOLE STREET NIGHT 2 41
TAYLOR and DALLAS wrestling seriously Now Dallas is no pushover
he has the physical pedigree of a well-bred Ivy League quarter-
back and is almost as strong as Taylor

Nevertheless TAYLOR had the element of surprise and is soon
mooshing his enemy’s face into the dust He hisses into his ear

TAYLOR

I’1ll tell you what my thing

is Woolf My thing is to

climb this fucking mountain

If you’re on my rope while

Im doing it I’ll fight for

your life But I hope one day

you’re not on my rope and you

fall off the fucking mountain
‘Cos when you do I’11l be there

Woolf and my thing at that point

will be absolutely for fuckun’

definite to piss on your grave

Now TAKANE is at hand hauling TAYLOR off CLAYBORN arrives too

CLAYBORN
You idiots

The LAMBARDAR and the BALTI VILLAGERS look on at this fascinating
floorshow and wonder what these strange visitors will get up to
next

The OTHER CLIMBERS gather too and while TAKANE continues to hold
the TWO panting MEN apart CLAYBORN reads them the riot act

CLAYBORN
One more of those and you’l1l
both spend the rest of the
trip packhorsing If you can’t
behave like men I’11 treat you
like animals We’re here - this
is it From now on we’re a team
we’ve got to be Anybody not in
the team is a danger to it

42 3 EXT BALTORO GLACIER MORNING 42

CRUNCH A cramponned CLIMBING BOOT stomps on the thin crusty snow
that covers a CREVASSE on the glacier As the icy surface layer
shatters we see the black hole of the chasm yawning below

TAKANE
Jesus Big one here

TAKANE turns around to warn the rest of the men on his rope In
an ever-vaster landscape of snow and rock the expedition - roped
together in teams of five or ten for safety - snakes its way up
the frozen river of ice towards its goal

Each of the climbers leads one of the roped groups We see
CLAYBORN first among equals - striding out in front of his
party urging them to make more than their natural pace Near
him TAKANE and DALLAS seem to be in competition everyone is keen
to impress with his fitness and determination in order to
maximize his chances of being chosen for the summit team Perhaps
even MALIK harbors summit ambitions

TAYLOR and HAROLD urge their respective teams along in parallel
ignoring MUMBLES of protest from the PORTERS struggling along
behind

Suddenly one of HAROLDS TEAM stumbles and falls causing his
crocodile to grind to a confused halt TAYLOR ignores the break-
down and presses on relentlessly

HAROLD

Hey What’s the big hurry
TAYLOR

Devil takes the hindmost boyo
HAROLD

Wait
TAYLOR

Catch up

TAYLOR sees DALLAS turn to check on their relative positions in
the pecking order and SHOUTS at his men to go even faster

HAROLD
Christ

HAROLD bullies his team to pull themselves together takes a deep
breath and finally sets off in pursuit

43EXT CAMPSITE ON THE BALTORO NIGHT 43

As COOKING FIRES glow on the moonlit glacier the AMERICANS take
the chance to chat by their fire or write in their journals
TAKANE who has brought small SPEAKERS for his Professional WALK-
MAN explains the words of a favorite C and W song to MALIK while
CLAYBORN watches TAYLOR pass a cup of coffee to DALLAS the two
rivals now maintain an icy detachment from each other JACK is
recounting some epic alpine adventure to no one in particular

While the STARS twinkle in the brilliant sky above everyone
looks exhausted but happy Life is good this is what it’s all
about TAYLOR looks at HAROLD who grins before jotting
something else in his journal HAROLD is left-handed his WEDDING
RING flashes in the firelight while he writes

44 EXT GLACIER MARCH MONTAGE DAY
ANOTHER MONTAGE as the expedition slowly wends its way towards
the upper reaches of the Baltoro glacier past minor KARAKORAM
PEAKS PAIYU TRAGO ET AL the landscape becomes ever vaster
bleaker and more inhospitable

As evening approaches a STORM is brewing CLAYBORN listens on
the RADIO for the WEATHER REPORT from Dasso the news doesn’t
sound good and visibility is becoming poor - none of the
mountains can be seen

CLAYBORN
How far to Concordia
MALIK
Two hours
CLAYBORN

Think we’ll make it before
this storm hits

MALIK
This is not a good place to
camp I think

TAYLOR
Come on let’s go for it

TAKANE and HAROLD nod their agreement while the contrary DALLAS
sulks CLAYBORN considers --— and then tugs his protesting gaggle
of PORTERS forward into the gathering storm

45 EXT CONCORDIA CAMP EVENING 1 45

The party struggles to erect their tents in the teeth of a fierce
gale Visibility is close to zero they could be anywhere

The utterly exhausted PORTERS drop their loads in piles and fight
to arrange their more rudimentary shelters

HAROLD and TAYLOR finally get their tent to work and stumble into
it zipping it up immediately after them

46 INT HAROLD and TAYLOR’S TENT CONCORDIA NIGHT 46

As they struggle in the confined space to organize their packs
light the GASLAMP extract their sleeping bags get the STOVE
going for something hot to drink they have to SHOUT to be heard
over the storm They are both whacked

LATER they sit snug in their sleeping bags reading We HEAR the
STORM continuing outside HAROLD notices that TAYLOR is reading
The Art of War by Sun Tzu Confucius meets Machiavelli

HAROLD
I never read that

TAYLOR
(HOLDING UP THE BOOK)
It’s good on strategy When you
will survive if you fight quickly
and perish if you do not this is
called ‘dying ground’

TAYLOR passes the book to HAROLD who scans it READING
HAROLD
People on dying ground are as
it were sitting in a leaking
boat lying in a burning house

HAROLD listens to the fierce WIND roaring across the tent fabric

TAYLOR
You got your strategy figured
out H

HAROLD
I dunno What do you mean

(HANDING THE BOOK BACK)
What’s your strategy

TAYLOR
Mine is mine Question is --
what’s yours No one else can
climb the mountain for you H

HAROLD
I know that What are you
trying to say It’s every man
for himself from here on in

TAYLOR
If it comes to that youve got
to be able to deal with it sure

HAROLD
Any rules at all Would you draw
the line at say eating human

Flesh Mine for instance

TAYLOR
Anything can happen up here H
You can’t rely on anybody but
yourself That’s all I’m trying
to say

HAROLD looks thoughtful even a little troubled as he turns away
from TAYLOR and listens to the gale FADE TO BLACK

47i INT i HAROLD and TAYLORS TENT - CONCORDIA DAWN oi 47
TAYLOR opens his eyes The storm has died and the terrible sound
of the wind is replaced with total silence Then he notices
that the tent is buried by a snowdrift the ceiling sags down
and the light is diminished

TAYLOR
H We’re snowed in

But HAROLD’s sleeping bag is empty TAYLOR drags off his bag and
starts to find his outer clothes boots etc

When he’s dressed TAYLOR is about to start burrowing his way out
through the snowdrift when HAROLD sticks his head into the snow
tunnel we

HAROLD
Taylor

TAYLOR
What’s the matter

HAROLD
Nothing’s the matter Close
your eyes

TAYLOR
Huh

HAROLD
Close your eyes

48 EXT CONCORDIA CAMP DAWN 48

TAYLOR stumbles out of their buried tent into the deep powder
snow and a sparkling bright blue dawn HAROLD points him ina
particular direction

HAROLD
Okay open your eyes

CU TAYLOR’S FACE as he opens his eyes - to be confronted by the
most impressive collection of mountains anywhere on earth This
camp at Concordia is at the confluence of two mighty glaciers
these two monstrous rivers of ice are effortlessly dominated at
this point by Broad Peak Mitre Peak Mustagh Tower plus the
four Gasherbrums and their satellites

Now TAYLOR turns to the left and looks up the Godwin Austen
GLACIER where he sees a new mountain of truly appalling height
Its beautifully proportioned pyramid fills the whole end of the
valley and even at this most spectacular place on earth there
is simply nothing else to look at

HAROLD
K2

TAYLOR
Fuck me

The others stamp around pointing out the glistening peaks to each
other They all know unequivocally in this instant why they are
here This is Real Life and everything else pales in comparison

CLAYBORN
Everybody feeling all right
(EVERYBODY IS)
Good - because there’s no
reason why we shouldn’t
make Base Camp tonight
No good reason that is

Some of them-LAUGH but just now there are restive SHOUTS from
the PORTERS’ CAMP in the background and as MALIK comes running
up the LAUGHTER instantly dies away

MALIK

Mr Clayborn Mr Clayborn
CLAYBORN

What now
MALIK

The porters will not walk
on the glacier It is too
dangerous They say they

TAYLOR makes to stand up CLAYBORN orders him to sit again

CLAYBORN
the trip with us will get an
extra twenty rupees per day
for this part of the glacier
Is that clear This section
only We leave in ten minutes

TAYLOR
Those fuckers

CLAYBORN
Come on everybody Last day
Then we’re on the mountain

The AMERICANS struggle into their packs for the last stage of the
walk-in TAYLOR claps HAROLD on the back and quietly points out
CLAYBORN taking a sustaining hit of oxygen WHISPERING

TAYLOR
How long’s he gonna STAY on
the mountain he’s sucking
on the 0-2 already

The expedition is strung out in a long line with the AMERICANS at
the front Suddenly the BALTIS start to knot up and slow down
and IBRAHIM - who as usual is the only one not carrying anything
at all - runs forward to find MALIK And then MALIK struggles
back up the line to find CLAYBORN The Liaison Officer’s grim
expression says it all

CLAYBORN
Don’t tell me

MALIK
They want to rest

CLAYBORN
For how long

MALIK
For --- the rest of the day

CLAYBORN
WHAT

MALIK

They want to make camp here

CLAYBORN
We’ve only been going two hours

MALIK
They say it’s too dangerous
Deep snow many crevasses —
DALLAS

What will camping here prove

TAYLOR
Itll prove that they get an
extra day’s pay

CLAYBORN
We’re going on to Base Camp to
night Otherwise no one gets paid

MALIK
They will not move Sahib

CLAYBORN
Well see about that

CLAYBORN followed by TAYLOR DALLAS and MALIK move down the line
to have it out with the ringleaders

They are confronted by an angry menacing MOB who wave sticks
and seem in no way intimidated by the white mens’ status as their
employers After much pushing shoving and SHOUTING a lot of
which is done by TAYLOR one of the BALTIS actually throws a
punch which momentarily decks TAYLOR

DALLAS
The ego has landed

Stung as much by this comment as by the blow TAYLOR leaps to his
feet and fights his way back to the particular PACK where their
stash of RUPEES is hidden

Returning to the fray TAYLOR grabs out a fistful of the low
denomination BANKNOTES and right under the horrified noses of
the BALTI RINGLEADERS sets fire to the money

MALIK
Stop

TAYLOR
Tell them they don’t want the
money we’ve already agreed on
I’il burn the fucking lot Tell
them that

MALIK
Stop You must not do this

But it’s too late and the SHRIEKING BALTIS shrink back from this
appalling act which cleariy establishes TAYLOR as a dangerous
lunatic

TAYLOR
Ten bucks worth big deal

MALIK
Ten dollars will feed one of
their families for six months

TAYLOR
That’s what I call cost-effective

MALIK
You do not negotiate with them by
destroying what they do not have

TAYLOR
You know a better way So far
I haven’t seen it

TAYLOR holds the BAG OF MONEY high for all to see and forges to
the front of the line

TAYLOR
Come and get it before it’s
too late

The expressions on the faces tell us that TAYLOR has won the
round but not the fight We also see that MALIK remains as
appalled and insulted as the Baltis at what Taylor has done

30 EXT ICE FALL GODWIN AUSTEN GLACIER DAY i590

On this last and most dangerous section of the glacier everybody
is roped in smaller groups than usual HAROLD’S GROUP has just
followed DALLAS’ GROUP across an ICE BRIDGE over a huge CREVASSE
in the glacier when HAROLD looks back to the NEXT GROUP This is
led by MALIK who makes the mistake of looking into the abyss and
freezes in the middle of the bridge Calling forward to DALLAS
HAROLD
WOOLF
(DALLAS TURNS AROUND)

I’m gonna tie onto the

Malik’s group Take mine

on will you

DALLAS
Yeah - okay

HAROLD detaches himself from his group of PORTERS and attaches
them to the end of DALLAS’ group before turning back to help the

stranded group MALIK is still paralysed by fear the crevasse
appears to be hundreds of feet deep when there is suddenly a
great splintering SOUND --— and the BRIDGE begins to collapse

MALIK miraculously finds his feet again ---

MALIK runs towards HAROLDS side of the bridge leaps the last
few feet lands on his belly and slams his AXE into the ice in a
classic safety moments before the PORTERS on the other end
of the rope disappear SCREAMING into the crevasse

We see the incredible strain on MALIK’S face - and we also see
the strain on the AXE with the weight of the others on it as it
begins to cut a path through the ice

While HAROLD is sprinting back towards MALIK DALLAS TAYLOR and
TAKANE are untying from their groups and running back too

Fractions of a second before MALIK slips over the edge to his
certain death HAROLD reaches him slams the heels of his
crampons into the ice grabs the top of MALIK’S AXE and sits
back in a seated belay He manages to postpone the tragedy but
then the AXE starts to cut through the ice again Moments before
both of them are pulled over the edge

DALLAS clips a rope through MALIKS HARNESS then SCREAMS at
TAYLOR and TAKANE who are bringing up the rear

DALLAS
SAFETY

TAYLOR and TAKANE immediately loop the rope around their axes
drive them into the ice and fall on them in the safety
position DALLAS races back from the edge and does the same

DALLAS
(TO HAROLD)
LET GO

HAROLD releases the axe and MALIK SCREAMS as he drops over the
edge of the crevasse The rope held by DALLAS TAYLOR and TAKANE
snaps taught and holds

MALIKS POV the OTHER PORTERS dangling SCREAMING below him in
the black bottomless crevasse

As CLAYBORN JACK and groups of the other PORTERS arrive they
help haul the line of PORTERS out of the abyss into which many
of the other BALTIS stare mesmerized Finally all the men stand
safely back on firm ice very glad to be alive Everyone else
gathers around to slap the hard-breathing HAROLD on the back
they all share a moment of elation Harold has done it again

DALLAS
Deja vu huh

TAYLOR
Yeah he’s becoming a regular
Saint fuckun’ Christopher

HAROLD
It’s nothing - forget it

MALIK
My wife and son will not
forget it You will be their
hero - always

TAKANE
Did you see the way the axe was
just slicing through the ice

Groups of PORTERS are already filing away and standing round in
whispering groups making no sign of reshouldering their loads

TAYLOR
We camping here or what

CLAYBORN surveys the PORTERS actions and mood and decides that
maybe they have all had enough for one day after all

CLAYBORN
Yes we camp here

The CLIMBERS look frustrated at yet another annoying delay

DALLAS
Congratulations Tarantino
After this is over I’ll nominate
you as US Ambassador to Pakistan

TAYLOR
You wanna go down that crevasse too

CLAYBORN
(MOVING IN QUICKLY)
Stop it or you’ll both go down
the crevasse Now get the tents up

51 INT HAROLD and TAYLORS TENT NIGHT 51

Late at night reading TAYLOR is still with The Art of War

TAYLOR
So whats it feel like being
the big hero

HAROLD
It feels good - it feels -- God
That moment was worth my whole
lifetime I did something real for
once something powerful you know
I Harold Jamison had a measurable

effect on human lives I feel in
control like I can do anything I
want I feel - (JOKE) like I think

you must feel all the time Taylor

TAYLOR
Nothing like a little catastrophe
to start the heart huh

TAYLOR smiles at his friend and reads from the book

TAYLOR
Confront them with annihilation
and they will then survive plunge
them into a deadly situation and
they will then live When people
fall into danger they are then
able to strive for victory

HAROLD
Victory

HAROLD shoots out his right hand and they do their handshake

TAYLOR
Victory

TAYLOR turns off the GAS LAMP and we watch the MANTLE die from
white to black

The SUN climbs over the peaks on the Eastern edge of the valley
and paints the immense snowscape pink

TAYLOR emerges from his tent and looks away over towards the
edge of the glacier to where TAKANE is digging a hole in the
thin ice He walks over as TAKANE strips off

TAYLOR
Whats this

TAKANE
Just my little Samurai number
Last day before the mountain

TAYLOR watches astonished as the naked TAKANE lowers himself chin
deep into the freezing water

TAYLOR
How long you stay in there

TAKANE
(THROUGH WILDLY CHATTERING TEETH)
As long as I can stand it

Constitutionally unable to resist a challenge now TAYLOR starts
to strip off then plunges naked and SCREAMING his warcry - into
the water beside the strong-willed Japanese

Now DALLAS emerges from his tent and stares at this curious
competitive spectacle TAYLOR stares back at his enemy daring
him to join them

TAYLOR
Coming in Woolf

DALLAS continues to stare - but then he turns away as if
listening to some disturbing SOUND

TAYLOR and TAKANE continue to stare at each other each desperately
willing himself to survive the longer in the freezing water Then
they hear CLAYBORN SHOUTING

BACK AT THE TENT HAROLD is just emerging when he hears the
SHOUTING too and hurries towards the voices

HAROLD looks back down the glacier towards Concordia to see
large groups of PORTERS many of them carrying their packs of
FOOD heading for home While MALIK dogs the heels of one group
SHOUTING IBRAHIM is running around ARGUING too and looking very
worried Meanwhile more and more PORTERS are dumping their loads
and moving off

HAROLD pursues the leaders passing CLAYBORN —- who looks lost
distracted and even defeated

HAROLD
Hey Where are you going
Come back
(CATCHING UP TO MALIK)
What’s happening Where are
they going

MALIK
Home They will not go on

HAROLD
But they have to We’re only
four hours from Base Camp
MALIK just shrugs and darts ahead to try to sway another of the
leaders Meanwhile HAROLD spots one of the men he saved from the
crevasse Seizing his arm

HAROLD
What’s the matter Just a few
more hours and we’re there

There is a hint of recognition and even regret in the PORTER’S
EYES - but he nevertheless pulls away and keeps walking HAROLD
tugs at his sleeve and keeps TALKING to him - the porter doesn’t
understand a word of English — but the Plea has no effect whatso-
ever and HAROLD is reduced to standing on the glacier watching
the disgruntled deserting men streaming all around him

BACK IN THE ICE-WATER BATH Even in this emergency TAYLOR’s
pride forces him to wait for TAKANE to get out first

And then the TWO PINKFLUSHED NAKED MEN race across the glacier
to find out what’s going on but they are too late

They arrive to see that the dispirited HAROLD MALIK and IBRAHIM
are already returning to CAMP - without the porters About
ninety-five percent of the Baltis have left leaving PACKS strewn
in piles all over the ice TAKANE and TAYLOR are still naked and
shivering a sight that DALLAS finds extremely distasteful

TAKANE
What are we going to do

TAYLOR
Fuck it We take it up ourselves

DALLAS
Fourteen tons of it Is this
before or after you get dressed

TAYLOR
What’s the matter cowboy I
thought you ate bobcats for
breakfast

DALLAS
I’m talking about time asshole
It’1ll take us maybe two weeks

CLAYBORN
He’s right We’ll be cutting
it close with the weather
this late in the season

TAYLOR
So We take less Cut down

DALLAS
7” What are you talking about
We need everything that’s
why we brought it

TAYLOR
People have climbed this baby
with a whole lot less than
fourteen tons of gear you know

JACK and TAKANE
But -

TAYLOR
Aw well then - hey fellas —
why don’t we just quit huh
(EVERYONE HANGS THEIR HEADS)

TAYLOR
C’mon They’re doing us a favor
We don’t need all this crap
(PLEADING)
All we need is to be a TEAM
right

Hes right CLAYBORN finally nods

CLAYBORN

Taylor and Takane - you come
with me and Jack to break up
the gear Dallas — you strike
camp Harold you organize
the porters who are still
here Any questions

(THERE ARE NONE)
Right Let’s do it

53 EXT BASE CAMP SET-UP MONTAGE DAY 1 53

During the next two or three days in variable weather the
CLIMBERS and remaining PORTERS - even the lazy IBRAHIM carries
light loads - struggle to transport the reduced equipment haul
from the glacier to the foot of the mistblown mountain

BASE CAMP is finally established at the foot of K2 - a scatter of
colorful TENTS dotted about on the glacier just beyond the
avalanche zone - and in the process we see the climbers begin to
work as a real team for the first time

54 3 EXT GILKEY MEMORIAL BASE OF K2 DAY 34

HAROLD takes a PHOTOGRAPH of the memorial to the many climbers
who have died on K2 a stone CAIRN festooned with saucepan and
tin box lids with inscriptions beaten into them

TAYLOR VO
Coming H

HAROLD hurries across to where the rest of the party are packed
up and making ready to move up the mountain JACK and MALIK are
listening to the weather report from Dasso on the radio

JACK
They give us two days of
clear weather

CLAYBORN points to a basic DIAGRAM of the mountain spread out on
the snow He traces a line up the center the magic line route
then he takes another hit of oxygen once again HAROLD exchanges
a look with TAYLOR

CLAYBORN
All right I want to have Camp
One stocked by then and ropes
laid to Camp Two ---

TAYLOR
(POINTING ON THE MAP)
You still favor fixed ropes
all the way to Camp Four

CLAYBORN
I favor fixed ropes all the
way to the summit but we’ll
see how we go with the weather

WHOOMP A huge AVALANCHE crashes down onto the glacier close to
where they stand The few remaining PORTERS shift uneasily

MALIK

The mountain is waking up
TAYLOR

Take off your wedding ring H
HAROLD

Why
DALLAS

Because if you get frostbite
your fingers’11 swell and
it’1ll give you gangrene

TAYLOR
Love kills baby

HAROLD takes off his gloves strings his WEDDING RING around his
neck and puts his gloves back on

CLAYBORN
You take lead on the first
rope Dallas Taylor you take
the second Questions

HAROLD is looking up at THE SUMMIT looming straight above them
The faceted sheer walls of ice and granite glint in the sunlight

TAYLOR
Yeah We all get an equal
shot at the summit right

CLAYBORN
Based on fitness -— right

DALLAS
Do you get yours before or
after you piss on my grave

TAKANE
Come on fellas Team
CLAYBORN
Let’s go
55 EXT ASCENT TO CAMP ONE DAY 1 55

We see the various ROPED PAIRS of climbers negotiating the
Negretto Col on the South South West Ridge DALLAS and TAKANE in
the lead team set the ice screws TAYLOR and HAROLD come behind
laying the fixed ropes and behind them CLAYBORN JACK MALIK and
the OTHER PORTERS ferry loads

We watch them pass us at a certain point so far they all seem to
be working well although already the altitude (20000’) is
making every movement an effort

56 i EXT CAMP ONE DAY 256

DALLAS and TAKANE reach an area of Flattened ridge look at each
other nod perfect and dump their PACKS While they look at
the astonishing view - from here they can see all the way back
down the glacier to the CONCORDIA CAMP - the next pairing of
TAYLOR and HAROLD heave themselves up the last slope to Camp One

TAKANE
We’ll make this Camp One

DALLAS
Okay by you guys

TAYLOR
Jesus Fine by me

HAROLD nods agreement then looks back down the rope to where
CLAYBORN and JACK struggle up towards them

HAROLD
Clayborn’s struggling a bit

TAKANE
He always takes a few days to
acclimatize Hell be okay

TAKANE is already putting on the STOVE to melt some snow for hot
drinks

And by the time CLAYBORN and JACK haul themselves up to the camp
the drinks are ready TAKANE passes them around but HAROLD
refuses his Everybody turns on him in unison

EVERYBODY
Drink

TAKANE
Dehydration’s the real killer
over 20000’ Harold

HAROLD
(TAKING THE DRINK)
We’re at 20000 already

DALLAS
Welcome to the Death Zone

CLAYBORN is resting with his head on his pack he looks wasted
Meanwhile JACK is on the RADIO

CLAYBORN
Weve made good time

JACK
Weather’s holding

CLAYBORN
We’ll all go down now for
another load

HAROLD
Why don’t you rest here

CLAYBORN
I’m all right goddammit I
can pull my weight

37 EXT CAMP ONE NIGHT 1 57

On a still black night the TENTS glow as tiny insignificant RED
and GREEN dots on the vast dark mass of the mountain

58 EXT CAMP ONE DAWN 58

Leaving the tents erect the CLIMBERS have finished breakfast and
are about to set off on the day’s haulage work While CLAYBORN
JACK and MALIK prepare to descend for more gear the OTHERS are
heading higher to lay ropes to Camp Two and beyond

CLAYBORN
We’ll meet at Camp Two for supper

HAROLD
We could come back down here if -—

CLAYBORN
No need Camp Two Good luck

CLAYBORN JACK ET AL turn and using the fixed ropes lower
themselves over the edge for the downward journey Meanwhile the
OTHER FOUR prepare to head up

DALLAS
(TO TAKANE)
You want to lead today

TAYLOR
I want to lead today

DALLAS looks at TAYLOR then at TAKANE and then up the mountain
Immediately above them a vertical ICE CHIMNEY stretches several

hundred feet after which it appears to plateau out Checking
that CLAYBORN is out of sight

DALLAS
First one to the top leads
today
TAYLOR grins HAROLD gulps and before anyone has more time to

think about it they are all four of them hacking up the chimney
in a frenzy of axes crampons and flying ice

59 EXT TOP OF ICE CHIMNEY DAY i159

Before we can see the climbers we can HEAR their approach

Finally an ice axe and ice hammer stab into the lip of the ledge
followed immediately by two more sets of axes and hammers The
climber belonging to the first set pops his head over the lip It
is TAYLOR While he hauls himself over the lip DALLAS and TAKANEs
heads appear and moments later HAROLDS

TAYLOR absolutely shattered by his effort lies out full stretch
on his back on the ice while the others clamber up behind him
equally exhausted HAROLD collapses beside him

60 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 60

While the OTHERS prepare the next upward LOADS CLAYBORN is
collapsed in a chair gasping oxygen JACK looks concerned but
when CLAYBORN catches the look he puts the BREATHING APPARATUS
away and rejoins the work

61 EXT CAMP TWO DAY 61

With TAYLOR leading the FOUR CLIMBERS arrive at the slightly
less than sheer incline that will-be Camp Two The VIEW is ever
more extraordinary although only TAYLOR has eyes for it the
others are too wrecked TAYLOR breaks out the TWO-WAY RADIO

TAYLOR
Camp Two to Base Come in
Base -- you read me
62 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 62

JACK hears the SQUELCH on the RADIO and picks it up

JACK
Hey Taylor Base reading you

TAYLOR V0
We’re ready for you here
Everything okay

JACK
Roger we’re just setting off

63 EXT CAMP TWO DAY 63

TAYLOR standing the OTHERS lying

TAYLOR
We’re going to push on up to
Camp Three (GROANS FROM THE
OTHER THREE) See you back
here for supper Over

JACK V0O
Roger Good luck

HAROLD
Jesus What are you trying
to do to us

TAYLOR
Whatsamatter guys

HAROLD
I think I just fucking died
that’s what’s the matter

TAKANE
I KNOW I did

TAYLOR
You guys stay here and rest
I’1ll lay the ropes to Three
by myself

DALLAS
I’m coming with you But we
gotta have a drink first

TAYLOR looks at DALLAS he looks as wasted as the other two but
he is not about to let TAYLOR get the idea that he is top dog

A WHILE LATER DALLAS and TAYLOR put down their cups and rope up
together DALLAS is about to move off in the lead coils of rope
over both shoulders when TAYLOR lightheartedly pulls him back

TAYLOR
Thought I was climbing
lead today

DALLAS shrugs oh yeah forgot and steps aside to let TAYLOR
make the first move across a difficult face of icy granite

By the time TAYLOR and DALLAS make their way back down to Camp Two
TAKANE and HAROLD have set up camp on the narrow ledge and the
weather is closing in TAKANE hands the two climbers hot drinks

TAKANE
Storm coming in Otherwise
we’re in great shape

DALLAS
Heard from the others

HAROLD
Theyll be here any minute
TAYLOR looks over the edge to where Five hundred feet below Camp
Two the heavilyladen CLAYBORN JACK and MALIK are hauling them-
selves very slowly up the rope Then CLOUDS blow across the
mountain obliterating the climbers

HAROLD
Everything go okay

TAYLOR turns and nods nonchalantly but DALLAS doesn’t respond
HAROLD cannot tell whether it is from exhaustion or disdain and
wonders what passed between the two men when they were alone on
the mountain The wind is getting stronger every moment

65 EXT CAMP TWO NIGHT 65

The LIGHTS from the three tiny tents squeezed onto the inadequate
ledge are barely visible through the stormdriven cloud and snow

66 INT HAROLD and TAYLOR’S TENT NIGHT 166

While the LAMP splutters and the tent heaves in the wind HAROLD
and TAYLOR talk before going to sleep

HAROLD
How did you go with Dallas
today

TAYLOR
Fine

HAROLD
Come on what happened

TAYLOR
Nothing

HAROLD

Something must have I mean

TAYLOR
We laid rope I led most of
the day He didn’t say a word

HAROLD
Not one

TAYLOR
(SHAKES HIS HEAD)
He’s quite strong ---

HAROLD
What do you think about
when youre climbing

TAYLOR
Sex

HAROLD
Sex you’ve had or sex youre
going to have

TAYLOR
Sex I didn’t have I think
about the ones that got away

HAROLD
You mean there were some

TAYLOR
Cindy I never had Cindy

HAROLD
Thanks very much

TAYLOR
No there was a moment there
when you first met her she

HAROLD
She what You mean you jerk
yourself off on mountains
thinking about my wife

TAYLOR
Never mind You asked me

HAROLD
You’re fucking serious aren’t
you You get me up here --—

But this fascinating conversation is interrupted by TAKANE who
unzips and bursts into their tent a furious flurry of SNOW
blowing in with him As he frantically re-zips the tent

TAYLOR
Whats up

TAKANE
Clayborn’s sick Think it’s edema

67i INTEXT CLAYBORN’S TENT NIGHT 167

HAROLD TAYLOR TAKANE MALIK and JACK squeeze into the tiny tent
where CLAYBORN lies in his sleeping bag looking dreadful His
lips are blue his breathing weak and ragged JACK is taking his
pulse

7 CLAYBORN
Don’t feel --- too good
TAYLOR
You dont look too good
I mean -- er --
JACK

We’ve got to get you down

CLAYBORN
The storm’1l be over soon

JACK
Screw the storm Weve got
to get you down now Tonight

TAKANE
Tonight

JACK
We gotta get him as low as
possible as soon as possible

TAYLOR
Who’s gonna go with him

JACK
(BEAT)
I’ll go

MALIK
I will go also

JACK
The rest of you wait out
the storm here Let’s do it

JACK is administering oxygen but CLAYBORN is almost too listless
to breath it in While all hands urgently strip off their
leader’s sleeping bag and help pack the necessary gear

OUTSIDE THE TENT DALLAS stands aloof in the storm waiting for
the reins of power to fall into his hands

68 EXT CAMP TWO NIGHT 68

The storm is slightly easier when JACK and MALIK clip CLAYBORN onto
the fixed DOWN-ROPE - they all wear LAMPS on their helmets and
ease him over the edge JACK and TAKANE test their RADIOS then
TAYLOR HAROLD TAKANE and DALLAS stand and watch the THREE OTHERS
disappear before scurrying back to their respective tents

69 INT HAROLD and TAYLORS TENT NIGHT 69

Back in their sleeping bags there is the first Sign of real
tension between the two friends HAROLD stares heatedly at
TAYLOR who is about to extinguish the LAMP

TAYLOR
IT usually just take what I
want and fuck the consequences
H I didnt take Cindy okay

HAROLD
Who says she’d have wanted you

TAYLOR just smiles and turns off the LIGHT The WIND rages harder
again outside

TAYLOR V0
Think theyll make it

HAROLD V0
You’re a shit Taylor

TAYLOR VO

Yeah but at least I don’t mind
telling the truth about it

7O EXT CAMP TWO DAY 70

The STORM is much easier now and the FOUR CLIMBERS stand about
ready to set off back up to Camp Three DALLAS is on the RADIO to
Base Camp

DALLAS
But he’s okay

JACK V0
He’s not great but he’s
stable Malik’s gone back
to the dump for more oxygen

DALLAS
What about the weather

JACK V0
Patchy Tomorrow should be
better

DALLAS

Roger Were heading up now
We’1l1 call you from Three

JACK VO
Take it easy Over

The FOUR OF THEM zip up the TENTS don their extraheavy PACKS
and set off up the rope

71 EXT ON THE MOUNTAIN DAY 71

The FOUR CLIMBERS haul themselves up the rope between Camps Two
and Three first TAKANE then DALLAS HAROLD and TAYLOR brings
up the rear

TAYLOR pauses for a moment and looks up towards the summit

A gap in the CLOUDS appears and the SUMMIT is briefly visible
like an Indian arrow head against the troubled sky

72 EXT CAMP THREE DAY 172

The FOUR CLIMBERS pause at the end of the FIXED ROPES the site
for CAMP THREE While the weather looks a little clearer TAKANE
brews drinks and DALLAS talks to Base

DALLAS
Camp Three to Base Can
you read me over

JACK V0O
Clear as a bell boy How
you all doing

DALLAS
Were all fine Hows Clayborn

JACK V0
He’s a little better He’s
sleeping most of the time

DALLAS
How’s the weather

JACK V0
Reasonable

DALLAS

Were going to keep on going
up to Four

The OTHER THREE look at each other DALLAS has taken an executive
decision without consulting them

JACK VO
Whats the big hurry

DALLAS looks back at the others but despite a few significant
looks none of them choose to dispute the call

- DALLAS
We’11 call you from Four Over

DALLAS switches off the RADIO stows it in his pack and accepts
a HOT DRINK from TAKANE

TAYLOR
Hell - why not We can be on
the summit for breakfast

DALLAS looks shifty while HAROLD strips off a glove to inspect
for frostbite TAYLOR touches his hot metal mug to one of
HAROLDS bare white FINGERS

TAYLOR
Can you feel that

HAROLD
No

TAYLOR looks at TAKANE and minutes later

HAROLD squats soaking his two bare hands in hot water in the
COOKING POT Meanwhile DALLAS is surveying the next pitch

DALLAS
Well take that ridge there
then traverse that wall -—

TAYLOR
You can traverse it if you
like It looks rotten to me

DALLAS
How can you tell from here

TAYLOR
Like I said you can go that
way you want Ill take what
ever’s in back of the ridge

DALLAS
A team sticks together

TAYLOR looks around for support but both of the others avoid his
gaze TAYLOR shrugs mockdemocratically and looks back up at the
big wall facing them

TAYLOR
Hope you remember that when
the shit hits the fan

73 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 73

JACK stares at the mountain through a powerful TELESCOPE on a
tripod while CLAYBORN dozes beside him in a deckchair wrapped
in his sleeping bag an OXYGEN CYLINDER on the snow beside him

JACK turns to say something but realizes that CLAYBORN is out of
it then stands back to allow MALIK to look through the telescope

74 EXT ROCK and ICE WALL ABOVE CAMP THREE DAY 74

TAYLOR climbs across the extremely dangerous wall of blue ice
over granite He looks down at the OTHER THREE CLIMBERS waiting
on the ledge below then drives in another ICE SCREW clips onto
it and allows it to take his weight It doesn’t A huge chunk of
rotten ice gives way ail round where the screw went in and
TAYLOR drops into space

TAYLOR
FALLING

The OTHERS take precautionary tension on the rope as TAYLOR’S
momentum rips out three other screws before the fourth — and last
holds TAYLOR ends up dangling limply in space not far above
the others’ heads He looks down at them — and smiles ironically

TAYLOR
Hey fellas Guess what Theres
some rotten ice up here

TAYLOR’S axe and hammer hang from their wrist straps He spins on
the rope slams the point of his axe into the ice and pulls
himself back onto the wall

75 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 275

CLAYBORN is awake now and looking slightly better But he is
still weak and can barely stand JACK is still looking through
the telescope

CLAYBORN
Where are they

JACK
There Just below the Mushroom
They’re making real good time

CLAYBORN
How’s the weather

MALIK
(TAKING OFF RADIO HEADPHONES)
Clear for twenty-four hours

JACK
And then

MALIK
Then bad

CLAYBORN

(LOOKS AT JACK)
What do you think

76 EXT CAMP FOUR DAY 76

While TAYLOR and a very tired TAKANE struggle with the SECOND TENT
DALLAS talks on the RADIO to Base through the open flap of the
FIRST TENT we see HAROLD stretched out resting

DALLAS
I say we go for it

CLAYBORN VO
Youve put in three of four
pretty solid days You sure
you can get to the summit and
back in twenty-four hours

DALLAS
No problem

TAYLOR drops what he’s doing and crawls into his tent

INT

HAROLDS and TAYLOR’S TENT -— CAMP FOUR DAY

HAROLD is wrapped in his sleeping bag dozing

TAYLOR
H Wake up Woolf wants to
go for the summit

HAROLD
Now Oh man I’m fucked

TAYLOR
We’re all fucked but we only got

a twenty-four hour weather window

HAROLD
Ohhh -- okay -- okay I’m ready

TAYLOR
You sure now

HAROLD initiates the special HANDSHAKE he hurriedly de-bags and
the two men scramble out of the tent

EXT

i CAMP FOUR DAY

TAYLOR and HAROLD reemerge from the tent to see DALLAS staring at

them

DALLAS
Take it easy No hurry

TAYLOR
I thought you said

DALLAS
I said we are going for the
summit No one said we meant
all of us

HAROLD

So what DOES we mean
DALLAS

It means me -- and Takane
TAYLOR

Now wait a minute If it’s
only two to the top you’ve
got to take the best two

DALLAS
Yes

TAYLOR
You - and me

TAKANE and HAROLD
Now you wait a minute

TAYLOR
I’m sorry Tak but were talking
about going now Dallas and I are
the only two who’ve got a shot
You stay

HAROLD cannot believe his own ears as his supremely opportunist
best friend betrays their us two as a team trust

HAROLD
Fuck you Taylor What is this

DALLAS
Takane and I are the summit team
Been that way since before you

TAYLOR
But you’ve got to take me
I’m the best climber And I’m
the fittest of any of us

DALLAS
I’m not taking you That’s that

HAROLD
Why the hell can’t we all go

TAYLOR
Give me that radio

TAYLOR is surprised when DALLAS hands the RADIO over without
question

TAYLOR
Clayborn Taylor We got a
little - diplomatic problem

here

CLAYBORN VO
Well whatever it is Dallas
will have to sort it out

TAYLOR
No listen We had a deal
We all get an equal shot at
the summit based on fitness

CLAYBORN V0O
Yes

TAYLOR
We got four guys here We all
want to go

CLAYBORN VO
Impossible Two have got to
stay back in reserve

TAYLOR
But --—

CLAYBORN VO -
Two stay That’s an order

TAYLOR
Okay - okay -- so now the
question is which two right

CLAYBORN V0O
Dallas will have to decide

TAYLOR
WHAT

CLAYBORN VO
I can’t decide who goes from
down here Taylor Dallas has my
full authority to act for me while
I’m out of action

TAYLOR switches off the RADIO in disgust and drops it on the snow

TAYLOR
You are so fuckun’ dumb Woolf

DALLAS
We’1ll see about that

TAYLOR avoids HAROLD’S glare and turns to look over the precipice
while DALLAS and TAKANE hastily prepare for their summit attempt

79 EXT BASE CAMP EVENING 179

MALIK looks through the TELESCOPE while JACK works the RADIO

MALIK’S POV he scans the top of the mountain until he picks up
the TWO CLIMBERS moving slowly and still far below the summit

MALIK
They won’t make it tonight

JACK
Weather update

CLAYBORN
What is it

JACK
I hate it

80 INT HAROLDS and TAYLORS TENT - CAMP FOUR NIGHT 80

HAROLD is still angry with Taylor for having wanted to sacrifice
their friendship pact to satisfy his summit ambitions Outside
the wind HOWLS

TAYLOR
Oh come on man speak to me

HAROLD
I just can’t believe you
would have gone without me

TAYLOR
What if Woolf had chosen you
instead of Takane You’d have
gone without me

HAROLD
No way

TAYLOR
Maybe that’s your problem

HAROLD
Oh I get it Were on ‘dying
ground’ now and anything goes
Whats next on the secret agenda

TAYLOR
(LISTENS TO THE WIND)
Well get our crack at it

HAROLD
I don’t trust you any more

The WIND is getting stronger all the time

TAYLOR
Okay okay I am a shit I
am a shit A hundred times
IT am a 100 total shit
(HAROLD SMILES A LITTLE)
Why do you think I want
to be around you H Huh

HAROLD
At this point I really
wouldn’t know

TAYLOR
Because you’re not a shit
HAROLD
I’m learning
TAYLOR

What’s that supposed to mean

HAROLD
Goodnight

HAROLD turns his back on TAYLOR TAYLOR does the same and they
end the scene ignoring each other like a feuding married couple

81 EXT i HAROLD’S and TAYLOR’S TENT THE MOUNTAIN NIGHT 81

The TINY TENT on the side of the huge mountain The LIGHT goes
out in the tent which then becomes quite invisible The mountain
CREAKS and GROANS and we get the feeling of the utter desolation
of being up there in these conditions

Somewhere on a steep SNOW SLOPE A MAN’S BODY cartwheels down

desperately clutching at a trailing unsecured ROPE The HEAD
LAMP is on as the body spins on down the mountain

82 INTEXT HAROLD’S and TAYLOR’S TENT - CAMP FOUR NIGHT 82

In the dark
HAROLD V0
What was that

TAYLOR VO
Huh What

HAROLD V0
Dunno I thought I heard
something a voice

And just then both TAYLOR and HAROLD SHOUT OUT in alarm as a
BODY crashes into the tent

When they sort themselves out they discover that the surprise
visitor is TAKANE - delirious and frozen almost to death They
light the LAMP re-pitch the tent and lay TAKANE out inside it

Then while TAYLOR gets the stove going for hot drinks HAROLD
does what he can for his fingers black with frostbite Finally
TAKANE has his eyes open and manages to take some liquid

TAYLOR
(SHAKING HIM)
Did you make the summit

TAKANE shakes his head From the look in his eyes we can tell
his spirit has been broken The mountain has told him to die

HAROLD
What happened to Dallas

TAKANE
Wouldn’t come down ---

HAROLD
You mean he was still
alive when you left him

TAKANE
(NODS HEAD)
Storm hit -- he wanted to
wait it out -- he --

HAROLD
But you didn’t have a tent
TAKANE
He wanted the mountain so bad
HAROLD
And you
TAKANE

It was very bad up there -
dark I cant feel my legs

TAYLOR
Has he still got the radio

TAKANE shrugs and TAYLOR grabs their RADIO up again

TAYLOR
Dallas Come in you dumb shit
(SQUELCH )
Answer me goddammit Dallas
Where the hell are you man

TAYLOR puts down the radio and looks at TAKANE who has dropped

off to sleep in HAROLD’S arms Outside the STORM rages harder
than ever TAYLOR looks at HAROLD who shakes his head

83 INTEXT HAROLD’S and TAYLORS TENT - CAMP FOUR DAWN 183

HAROLD wakes first and listens the storm has died away He
looks across to TAYLOR who is still asleep Between them lies
TAKANE covered with every piece of spare clothing they could
find HAROLD sits up an checks TAKANE’s pulse then his eyelids

HAROLD
Taylor
TAYLOR
Huh
HAROLD
WAKE UP
(TAYLOR OPENS HIS EYES)
Taks dead
TAYLOR
But he was --- oh fuck

Suddenly TAYLOR is out of his sleeping bag and after a cursory
almost superstitious glance at the corpse he is unzipping the
tent OUTSIDE there is a miraculous clear still blue dawn

HAROLD
Jesus Taylor What do we DO

TAYLOR
I don’t know

TAYLOR picks up the RADIO toys with it then looks at HAROLD he
really doesn’t know

HAROLD
- We gotta go look for Dallas
right
TAYLOR
Yeah Dallas --- right You
up for that
HAROLD
I’m up for it Are you up

for it

TAYLOR who seems uncharacteristically confused by this tragedy
nods vaguely and tosses the RADIO to HAROLD

TAYLOR
Here - you talk to them

84 EXT HAROLDS and TAYLORS TENT - CAMP FOUR DAWN 184

TAYLOR and HAROLD stand heads bowed for a moment’s silence by the
snow grave they have dug for TAKANE

85 EXT THE UPPER MOUNTAIN DAY 85

In clear weather TAYLOR and HAROLD search the accessible part of
the upper mountain But without any real clues as to where Dallas
might be their chances of finding him - dead or alive - are
slim Taylor is back in his single minded warrior mode

They climb free-style - no safety rope - up a reasonable ice
chimney until they reach a small Plateau above it from where
they can see fairly far around them No sign of Dallas anywhere

TAYLOR
DALLAS (BEAT) DALLAAAS
He could be anywhere up here

HAROLD
(INTO RADIO)
Hey Dallas You reading us
Where the hell are you

TAYLOR
Oh man this is pointless

HAROLD
You think he’s dead

TAYLOR
Yeah - I think he’s dead
Gotta be Don’t you think

HAROLD
Jack Phillip Anyone awake
down there

JACK V0O
Reading you Harold Over

HAROLD
There’s no sign of him up
here You heard anything

JACK V0
No Listen Phillip’s getting
worse again We’ve got to get
him down quick

HAROLD
How the hell you gonna do that

JACK V0
Malik’s trying to get an army
chopper to come up for us

HAROLD
Where does that leave us
JACK V0O
A long way from home unless you

get your asses down here real quick
The weather’s gonna hold today but
after that I don’t like it

HAROLD
(TO TAYLOR)
What do you think

HAROLD looks above them - to where the SUMMIT glints crystalline
white in the early morning sun

TAYLOR
We didn’t come up here for
nothing Screw the chopper
We walked in we can walk out
(GRABBING THE RADIO)
Jack -- Wish us luck Were
going for it

JACK V0O
But -

TAYLOR kills the radio and slips it into the pack They both
stare at the summit again

TAYLOR
We leave everything here — tent
bags travel light we can

be back here by tonight

HAROLD
Right Then bit of luck - we’re
back at Base by tomorrow night -

TAYLOR
And I bet you the goddam chopper
hasnt even arrived by then

HAROLD
We’re going to do it Taylor

TAYLOR
Yeah Except I thought you said
you didn’t trust me any more

HAROLD
That’s right

TAYLOR
So

HAROLD
Im working on it

TAYLOR smiles they do their Victory handshake then start
stripping TENTS ETC out of their packs

CAMP FIVE established HAROLD and TAYLOR carrying only the bare
minimum equipment necessary for a days climbing set off up

86 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 86

While MALIK SHOUTS into the RADIO in Pakistani in the background
JACK looks through the TELESCOPE and CLAYBORN takes up his usual
position in the chair He is looking alert but very ill

CLAYBORN
Well

JACK
Yeah I can see them

CLAYBORN
How close are they

JACK
Close enough Theyve got
a shot at it

CLAYBORN suddenly starts COUGHING desperately — he sees a speck
of BLOOD on his white glove while MALIK SHOUTS even louder

CLAYBORN
I’m sorry The chopper comes
we’re not waiting It’s their
risk That’s it

87 EXT TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN DAY 87

HAROLD’S FACE shows his sheer exhaustion as he drags himself up a
steep but negotiable ICE SLOPE At this airless altitude every
slightest movement is a tremendous act of will and the whole
exercise at this point is reduced to brute animal effort Just
ahead of him TAYLOR rests waiting for his buddy to catch up He
looks at his WATCH then he looks up at the SUMMIT which doesn’t
look so very far away now HAROLD collapses beside him

TAYLOR
Come on Another coupla hours

HAROLD
Oooo have mercy brother

TAYLOR
We left the mercy behind with
the gas-powered pitons H Ain’t
no mercy in the Death Zone

HAROLD
I HAVE GOT TO REST

TAYLOR
We rest on the summit

HAROLD
Right Rest on the summit

HAROLD rams his face into the’ snow gathering the strength to
carry on But first he lets out a desperate defiant HOWL

We watch the TWO COLORED FIGURES dragging themselves over yet
another dangerous ICE CORNICE at somewhere around 28000 feet
and somehow sense the almost surreal quality of this ridiculous
endeavour we get the idea of two guys locked into some insane
self-imposed ritual where a single false move will kill them
where the best they can hope for is just to survive

A mere few hundred feet above them the pristine white SUMMIT
dazzles in the clear strong sunlight the final slog up to
the summit is not technically difficult but it definitely
presents a challenge to the will Both men are now at the end of
their reserves of strength and trudge slow motion up the steep
slope as though they wear lead shoes in some dream

HAROLD pauses and looks at the incredible VIEW he imagines he
can see the whole Himalaya laid out around him Then he looks up
at the SUMMIT just above them and he knows for the first time
with certainty that they are going to make it Just ahead of him
TAYLOR falls to his knees for a moment’s respite HAROLD slowly
catches up to him

HAROLD
Taylor Were gonna do it
TAYLOR
Yeah I know
HAROLD

Come on Ten feet more

TAYLOR looks at the supreme sense of accomplishment on HAROLD’S
face and knows that this is Harold’s Big Moment on the mountain
Harold has transcended himself

TAYLOR
You go on I just —

HAROLD
No We rest on the summit

88 EXT THE SUMMIT DAY 88

TAYLOR allows HAROLD to haul him to his knees and they stagger
the last few feet to the SUMMIT glove in glove together They
embrace in exhausted ecstacy and collapse to the ground

HAROLD
Oh man we did it We fucking
did it

TAYLOR

You did it H You did it -
and no one can ever take it
away from you

They stand and turn slowly around looking at the VIEW It is
later in the day than perhaps they had hoped for the sun is
already setting behind ANGRY CLOUDS on the Western horizon and
the windchill factor is high

HAROLD takes out his CAMERA and takes some pictures then he gets
TAYLOR to take several of him mugging at the exact highest point
of the mountain Then they prop up the camera on a pack frame
set the timer release and take a picture of themselves together

While HAROLD still breathing heavily continues to be lost in
wonder TAYLOR gets out the TWO-WAY RADIO

TAYLOR
Hey Summit party to Base
You still with us Jack

The RADIO WHINES and splutters Finally

JACK V0O
Taylor Harold Where are you

TAYLOR
On top of the fucking world
That was the idea wasnt it
Except -- we forgot the flag

JACK V0
Congratulations Hang on ---

89 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 89

JACK passes the RADIO to CLAYBORN still swathed in quilting and
seated in his deckchair He COUGHS as he takes the radio

CLAYBORN
Taylor Phillip here
Congratulations

TAYLOR V0
Yeah It’s a top spot - view
is kinda like the one from
your office How you feeling

CLAYBORN
I feel like shit I got to
get off this mountain

TAYLOR V0O
I know what you mean We
heard about the chopper

CLAYBORN
Were hoping tomorrowday
after Can you be down by
tomorrow night

TAYLOR V0
We’1ll wait here -- send the
chopper up for us

CLAYBORN
Taylor - I have to tell you
I’m dying If you’re not here
it will leave without you

TAYLOR V0O
Whatever Here - speak to Harold
CLAYBORN
Harold
HAROLD VO
Phillip Wish you were here
CLAYBORN
If I was ten years younger
I would be
HAROLD V0
No -- it can happen to anyone
CLAYBORN

Especially grandfathers Well
done Harold Get your ass down
here Move it

He hands the RADIO back to JACK

JACK
And watch the weather you guys
You’re going to have a rough
night up there We’ll keep the
line open you need us

90 EXT THE SUMMIT EVENING 90

The moody SUNSET is rapidly becoming obscured by black clouds as
TAYLOR and HAROLD toast themselves with a hot brew They seem very
nonchalant and not in any hurry - they are possibly suffering a
little from high altitude “everything is fabulous euphoria

HAROLD
Thinking about the next girl

TAYLOR
I’m thinking about the next
mountain

HAROLD

Let’s get off this one first
What’s the strategy

As they pack up the STOVE etc and make ready for their descent
TAYLOR
The climb down is always the

hardest part you know

After one last look at the summit they turn and head on down the
mountain Somehow they both know that this will be the hard part

91 EXT THE MOUNTAIN NIGHT i91

TAYLOR and HAROLD are slipping down an ICE SLOPE in the dark when
BLACK CLOUDS swallow the FULL MOON - and seconds later the SNOW
STORM hits In seconds visibility is drastically reduced and so
TAYLOR gestures to HAROLD that they should rope up In their
determination to travel light they have only brought one short
length of rope between them

When ready they SHOUT something to each other - the wind blows
it away - and then they continue down The storm only gets worse

They fight their way along a narrow ridge but the weather is
beating them and it is time to find shelter Down there

A hundred feet further down after a life-saving belay by HAROLD
TAYLOR finds a protected bank of snow big enough to allow an ice
cave They move to the face away from the worst of the wind and
dig into the soft snow frantically with their hands

92 INT ICE CAVE DURING STORM NIGHT 192

Sheltered by TAYLOR the STOVE CATCHES ALIGHT HAROLD slams snow
into their pot and sets it over the fire to meit the flames
reveal the fear in their faces HAROLD’S HANDS are shaking

TAYLOR
Climb her while she sleeps

HAROLD
Uh huh and this one’s woken
up for a midnight snack Food

TAYLOR rummages in the pack but all he comes up with are four
Trail Mix bars and one pack of dried chicken soup

HAROLD
Great I love to travel light

TAYLOR
This is a picnic I lost
twenty pounds one trip

HAROLD
You know - I’m a bit worried

TAYLOR flicks a look at him as he stirs the snowsoup

TAYLOR
Yeah -- maybe it is shaping
up into a bit of an epic

HAROLD grabs the RADIO SHOUTS into it but they get nothing
but STATIC

HAROLD
An epic It’s already a Near
Death Experience

TAYLOR
This the worst jam you ever
been in
HAROLD
Yeah
TAYLOR
Nothing’s happened yet
HAROLD
Two guys are dead and --- and

were circling at ten thousand

feet over Base Camp in a white-
out with one packet of chicken

soup and no landing gear Want

me to go on

TAYLOR
Everythings cool We’ll make it

HAROLD
You’re just as scared as I am

TAYLOR
If I was I wouldn’t tell you

HAROLD
You dont have to tell me

TAYLOR
Fear is bullshit H Choke you to
death Ignore it We’re going to
get out of this This storm’1i
be over in a day or two —-—

HAROLD
Weve got nothing to eat
TAYLOR
Don’t need it
The STOVE SPLUTTERS and dies
HAROLD

Or drink There’s no more fuel

TAYLOR simply huddles himself up nearest the hole and stares out
into the storm

93 INT ICE CAVE DURING STORM DAY 93

TAYLOR looks at his WATCH 937 AM Twelve hours have passed and
the TWO MEN have barely moved The STORM continues unabated

HAROLD looks at his WATCH 446 PM The wind has died right down
and although visibility is still poor weather conditions are
altogether better

HAROLD
Lets go

TAYLOR gestufes okay and reaches for the RADIO to call Base

TAYLOR
Hey Base Jack — Fuck
HAROLD
What’s up
TAYLOR

Fucking BATTERIES

TAYLOR hurls the now useless RADIO through the mouth of the cave
and then without a further word TAYLOR zips up the PACK and
they’re out of there

94 EXT GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN EVENING 194

The weather is only reasonable and it is already almost dark
when they come to the top of an ICE CLIFF HAROLD is the more
anxious and exhausted of the two and as soon as they stop
moving his teeth start CHATTERING

TAYLOR
What do you think You
want to bivouac here

HAROLD
No Let’s do it

TAYLOR
Rope up

HAROLD

What’s the point Never
get a belay in this ice

TAYLOR
You feeling all right

HAROLD
Come on Taylor Let’s just
do it all right

TAYLOR shrugs and moves to take the lead down the dangerous ice

Crampons and axes digging desperately into the flaky ice HAROLD
Follows down just after TAYLOR who is climbing faster and more
confidently HAROLD closes his eyes breathes hard and puts one
foot in front of the other Each step each movement is agony

Half-way down HAROLD looks below to where TAYLOR is even
further ahead of him than before Fifty feet below TAYLOR there
is a marrow snow-covered ledge and below that another yawning
drop The height makes HAROLD momentarily dizzy

TAYLOR looks “up

TAYLOR
Okay H

HAROLD
OKAY

TAYLOR

Bad ice here Keep right

HAROLD yanks out his axe and stretches to his right looking for
purchase in order to change the angle of his descent His first
attempt is too weak to penetrate the ice the second seems to
hold He tests his weight on the axe pulls out his right crampon
and stretches it across

Pinned to the wall by his left boot and his right hand HAROLD
has got himself stranded his free right boot cannot find
purchase and he starts to flail with it

TAYLOR looks up alerted by the shower of ICE CHIPS from above
And just then HAROLD starts to panic

HAROLD
TAYLOR

TAYLOR
Hang on Coming up

TAYLOR begins to get organized to go back up when the point of
HAROLDS AXE starts to pull out of the ice and --—

HAROLD FALLS Grazing down the sheer wall of ice he passes the
appalled TAYLOR in a blur and plummets to the SNOW LEDGE below
Miraculously HAROLD sticks on the ledge without going over it
but then he lies ominously still one leg at a crazy angle

TAYLOR crampons down the ice wall as fast as he possibly can

TAYLOR turns his friend’s head around --- and finds a new and
overwhelming fear in HAROLD’S EYES He also immediately senses
the extent of Harolds injuries and fails in the first moment
that their eyes meet to disguise his certainty that Harold is
now doomed to die on the mountain

TAYLOR
What is it You okay

HAROLD
Leg

TAYLOR

(TOUCHING H’S RIGHT LEG)
This one

(HAROLD SCREAMS)
Can you bend it

TAYLOR shifts HAROLD’S LEG very slightly HAROLD SCREAMS again

TAYLOR
Broken huh

HAROLD nods his head through the shattering waves of pain Very
gently TAYLOR opens the sidezip on H’s mountain suit and care
fully examines the leg even through the thermal underwear we
can tell that the leg is a complete shambles HAROLD SCREAMS some
more during this operation tears streaming down his face then
he goes all calm

TAYLOR
Don’t think the bone has
come through the skin

HAROLD
Oh Cindy -- Cindy

TAYLOR
H It’s me I’m here

HAROLD
I don’t want to die

TAYLOR
Who said anything about that
This is going to mend fine
bone heals a whole lot better
if the skin isn’t broken see

HAROLD
You can make it You can still
make it but you gotta go now

TAYLOR
What are you talking about

HAROLD
I’m going to die Taylor

TAYLOR
Youre not going to die

HAROLD
I can’t walk You can’t carry
me We havent got enough rope
to work anything with

TAYLOR

I’1l go down and get some
HAROLD

Taylor nobody’s ever got a

stretcher case off this mountain
from so high up Never Not even
with a whole team

TAYLOR
Thats what I’1l1 do - I’11 go
down and get the other guys

HAROLD
Jack and Malik They’d never
make it They did I’d be dead
by the time they got here anyway

HAROLD fumbles inside his jacket - and pulls out his WEDDING
RING He snaps the cord and hands the ring to TAYLOR

TAYLOR
What are you doing

HAROLD
Give this to Cindy Tell her
- God I dunno - tell her I

loved her And I’m sorry

TAYLOR
Tell her yourself

HAROLD
Taylor I am dead meat I cannot
move Now get out of here

TAYLOR
I’m not going to do that

HAROLD
You just going to sit here
and die with me Bullshit

TAYLOR
You know what youre asking me
to do Is that your twisted
fuckun’ idea of revenge

HAROLD
No no no no

TAYLOR
Yes yes yes yes Every lousy minute
of every stinking day I gotta be
the selfish rat fuck who left his
noble buddy to die Well forget it
Not guilty

HAROLD
You never had a problem with
being selfish before Taylor -
it’s practically your religion
Why the hell do you have to make
such a big deal out of it now

TAYLOR

WHY Why do you think I do mountains
Huh You got the wife and the kid and
the nice job in medical research -
that’s great but what have I got
My whole life is about ME my work is
all about saving assholes from jail -
so I come to places like this with
you - to try and find a little grace
you know I don’t want to be selfish
all my life Baddahhh Meet the flip
side of Taylor Tarantino I want some
nobility god damn it - and you - my
very very best friend - want to take
that possibility away from me for ever

HAROLD
You want nobility You want grace
Go back

TAYLOR
I AM NOT GOING BACK TO SPEND FIFTY
YEARS WITH THE FACT THAT I LEFT MY
BUDDY TO DIE ON SOME GODDAM MOUNTAIN

Now HAROLD fumbles in the PACK and produces his CAMERA

HAROLD
You’re really my friend Taylor
that’s exactly what you’ve got
to do I want you to look after
my son I want you to give him
these tell him I made it - tell
him what a big fucking hero I was
Tell him how I died and tell him
how much I loved him that’s
what I want and then I’1ll have it
all We can both have it all Taylor
if you just - go back Please -

Their eyes meet for a moment of truth and then TAYLORS EYES are
straying down the mountain After a long and silent conversation

TAYLOR
Youre a prince H

HAROLD turns his head away smiling to himself mysteriously

TAYLOR
What

HAROLD
Nothing

TAYLOR
WHAT

HAROLD

Fuck Prince You’re the born
survivor Taylor That’s what
I always admired about you

TAYLOR
Because Im a ruthless shit
you admired me

HAROLD
There’s some destiny thing about
single-minded people that us
born losers find very compelling

TAYLOR
You are not a loser

HAROLD
I got everything I wanted but
I had to give up everything to
get it Is that winning

Meanwhile TAYLOR is stripping every superfluous thing he doesn’t
need off his body to reduce the weight he leaves the PACK with
HAROLD and even takes off his WATCH - we see it says 647 PM
He offers it to HAROLD who refuses it

HAROLD
How long have I got

TAYLOR sniffs the weather and shrugs

TAYLOR
How long have I got

HAROLD takes off his own WATCH and throws it into the storm It
lands not far along the ledge TAYLOR does the same with his
WATCH and then they embrace

TAYLOR
I love you H

HAROLD
I know And teach Eric to
climb good will ya

TAYLOR drives one of his last PITONS into some healthy ice

TAYLOR

Ill take good care of Eric
HAROLD

Eric - and Cindy

- TAYLOR

Oh Jesus Will you stop it
HAROLD

Yeah guess I better Ill

tell you the rest in heaven

TAYLOR
You’11 have to write me a
letter ‘cos I’1l be in hell

They stares into each others’ eyes for a long last farewell
moment Their eyes mirror each others pain but also each
other’s souls they have at last shared some deep primal under
standing And then TAYLOR drops over the ledge and is gone

HAROLD lies back down and watches TAYLORS ROPE tense and twang
as he abseils down the face below Moments later once TAYLOR has
reached bottom he releases and pulls the rope down after him

CU the end of the rope as it zips through the piton and silently
disappears over the ledge

HAROLD is now totally utterly alone

95 INT CLAYBORNS TENT AT BASE CAMP NIGHT 195

JACK enters CLAYBORN’S TENT the sick man stirs in his sleeping
bag we see his FROSTY BREATH as thin spindrifts of steam

JACK
Phillip You awake

CLAYBORN
Uh What is it

JACK
Chopper11l be here tomorrow

CLAYBORN
Thank God What about Taylor

JACK
Haven’t heard anything for over
twenty-four hours

CLAYBORN
Nothing

JACK
Doesn’t look good Im afraid

CLAYBORN absorbs this new blow and simply turns his head away

96 EXT i TAYLORS DESCENT NIGHT 1 96

Although a cruel wind whips TAYLOR’S FACE the sky is at least
partly clear and a FULL MOON mocks his efforts to find the best
line of descent Starving and totally exhausted he trips falls
and SWEARS violently as he tumbles down a SNOW SLOPE

TAYLOR comes to rest and lies still for a moment staring up at
the MOON Then his eyes close it would be so much easier to
forget the whole thing and just go to sleep SNOW blows
across his face flakes already settling in the hollows

97 EXT HAROLD’S LEDGE NIGHT 1 97

HAROLD lies back staring at the MOON SINGING to himself to take
his mind off his pain and the hovering prospect of his grim
death He stares too at the WATCH just out of reach along the
ledge which ticks off the remaining minutes of his existence

98 EXT TAYLORS DESCENT NIGHT 98

TAYLOR’S EYES pop open he SHOUTS something to himself hauls
himself to his feet and starts slamming one boot in front of the
other front-pointing down yet another moonlight-drenched ice
face with alarming bravado TALKING as if to a woman

TAYLOR
Come on baby You let me climb
up you -- let me climb off ya
That’s it -- that’s my girl -
I wanted you so bad baby too
bad you know - and youre the

best I ever had - so let’s not
spoil it now huh Oooooo I can
smell yooooou you evil fuckun’
bitch - I can’t see you but
I can sure as hell smell you

99 3 EXT ON THE MOUNTAIN NIGHT 99

SNOW blows off a luminous WATCHFACE which is ona MAN’S WRIST
The time is 112 AM

100 EXT HAROLDS LEDGE NIGHT t 100

HAROLD’S frosted eyes are closed as he lies still He is still
SINGING but--only just as his teeth are chattering too hard
Nearby the WATCH continues to count the seconds

101 EXT TAYLORS DESCENT NIGHT 1101

A beard of CLOUD blows across the FULL MOON as TAYLOR slithers
down an iced granite face His face is bleeding his knees
bruised He lands on an apparent ridge of snow turns and moves
towards the edge to inspect the drop

The crust gives way without warning as TAYLOR approaches the edge
and he slides over it slowly at first as though in a controlled
glide But then he does gather speed and he has no control
whatsoever At one moment he is falling freely through space

And then his fall is abruptly broken He lies very still on soft
snow his eyes closed A SNOWFLAKE staunches the fresh BLOOD on
his face

TAYLOR’S HAND grips the ROPE that broke his fall His fingers
move his eyes open He pulls the rope which zips out of the new
snow towards the other end of the ledge TAYLOR staggers up and
hauls himself along the rope at the other end of which is

A partly snow-covered DALLAS WOOLF deceased His LEFT HAND is
frozen in the grip of death around the other end of the ROPE And
on his wrist the luminous-face WATCHFACE (SCENE 99) says 123AM

TAYLOR
Been looking for you Snowman

DALLAS’ EXPRESSION is a frozen moment of illuminated outrage that
he too should be subject to the laws of nature TAYLOR’S FINGER
prods the brittle arc of his proud blue patrician nose TAYLOR

switches on DALLAS’ HEAD LAMP - it blinds him He LAUGHS
TAYLOR
No offence - I would piss on

your grave but I’d for sure
freeze my dick off doing it
know what I mean

DALLAS is frozen upright against the wall so that TAYLOR has to
RIP him off the ice like a strip of velcro in order to get at the
COILS OF ROPE on the dead man’s shoulders

TAYLOR
Yes Virginia there is a
Santa Claus —

Now TAYLOR can also reach DALLAS’ PACK HARNESS He manages with
difficulty to remove the PACK from the frozen corpse now lying
on the ground then starts inspecting the CONTENTS ’

TAYLOR
And this year he’s brought
you - an oxygen cylinder

Just what I needed
(HE TAKES A HIT)
Meat Bars You shouldn’t have
(HE TAKES A BITE)
A Rocket Flare For the boy
who has everything

TAYLOR STUFFS the FLARE and a number of other useful items back
into the PACK Still rummaging

TAYLOR
Wheres the goddam radio Jesus
The one thing I actually ASKED
for Always thought Santa sucked

Finished packing TAYLOR stares down again at DALLAS’ frozen face

TAYLOR
I don’t exactly know why I
hated you so much but I sure
as hell did Snowman Probably
‘cos you didn’t trust me

Finally TAYLOR removes DALLAS’ ICE AXE which is still attached
to DALLAS’ RIGHT HAND He studies it for a moment

TAYLOR
You think I’m a lowlife huh
I leave Harold to die so’s I can
go back to knock off his widow
Except you don’t even believe I
can get off this mountain do you

TAYLOR wearing DALLAS’ HEAD-LAMPED HELMET has by now donned the
PACK and makes ready to go He looks again at the second ICE AXE
in his hand decides he doesn’t need it and buries the handle in
the snow near DALLAS’ HEAD to form a crude crucifix

TAYLOR
News flash Woolf Im going to
have it all See you in hell

TAYLOR turns away and looks out over the edge of the ledge---
down the slippery white moon—lit slopes to safety below

102 EXT HAROLD’S LEDGE DAWN 1102

CU HAROLDS WATCH ticking off the seconds

By now HAROLD is almost delirious — and almost frozen to his
ledge the only movement we see is in his rapidly flickering EYES

Then he HEARS it - a VOICE - a distant urgent voice - and it’s
talking to him - hes suddenly sure of it

HAROLDS POV standing before him on the ledge a large blurred
SHAPE - almost like the shape of a man — and it has something
like an AXE in its hand raised aloft as if to strike him

HAROLD
No

TAYLOR
No This is Santa Claus baby
Tell you what -- I’11 give you
Miss Mammogram for Xmas - if
you just fuckun’ snap out of
it and talk to me man

HAROLD
Taylor Is that you

TAYLOR
(RIPPING HIS GOGGLES OFF)
Sorry to disappoint you
Virginia

HAROLD
Whats happening

TAYLOR kneels to supply HAROLD with LIQUID and comfort

TAYLOR
New plan Altered situation
assessment

HAROLD
Actually -- I am kinda glad
you showed up

TAYLOR
Yeah Why’s that

HAROLD
I had just absolutely definitely
decided that I do not want to die

up here
TAYLOR

Thats what I wanted to hear
HAROLD

Yeah -- see I thought there’s

two billion guys on the planet -
and any one of them’d take better
care of Cindy than you would

Meanwhile TAYLOR is applying OXYGEN more LIQUID and MEAT BARS to
HAROLD’S FACE as well as uncoiling ROPES repacking the other
PACK and ‘Stripping down the frame of the new one to make a
basket-brace for HAROLDS LEG which TAYLOR now prods

TAYLOR
Feel anything

HAROLD
Not really What’s that mean

Now TAYLOR theatrically produces a big KNIFE JOKINGLY

TAYLOR
Means gangrene and I’ve gotta
cut it off Now Save us both
a lot of trouble later dig

HAROLD
I think Cindy is kind of into
the idea of her husband coming
home with two legs you know

They do their Victory handshake and then TAYLOR clips a ROPE
through HAROLDS HARNESS While he straps the dead leg into its
BRACE and HAROLD winces in newly revived pain TAYLOR produces a
beautifully thin FLASK

TAYLOR
Drink ‘Cos this is gonna
hurt like hell

HAROLD
What is it

TAYLOR
Xmas Present from Dallas
Morphine base

HAROLD
This isn’t -- ouch like
you Taylor Pain mitigation

TAYLOR

Must be going all new-fangled
in my old age You should see
some of the other tricks I got
in here Now - listen up we
got rope for a three hundred
foot lower What we’re gonna
do is --

103 EXTINT CLAYBORN’S TENT DAWN i 103

While MALIK KNEELS OUTSIDE performing his dawn prayers JACK
stalks around him and bursts into the alert CLAYBORN’S TENT

JACK
Chopper’s on its way up

CLAYBORN
Any word from Taylor

JACK
Nothing It’s been two days

now
CLAYBORN ponders this provocative news
CLAYBORN

Well give him two more hours
Two hours Understood

104 EXT TAYLOR LOWERING HAROLD DAWN 104

The roped HAROLD - an ICE AXE strapped to each wrist - bounces
down an iced rock face at a controlled but harrowing pace Every
time his damaged leg makes contact with rock ie often — pain
cracks through his synapses like high country lightning

The pace slows then stops HAROLD grimly hobbles himself onto a
firm footing and tugs the rope to signal that he is in position
CU the exhausted but hopeful HAROLD

AT THE TOP OF THE ROPE TAYLOR breaks the belay and rapidly solos
down after it The WIND is stronger again

TAYLOR arrives above the waiting HAROLD then manoeuvres himself
down beside him RED SKY in the Morning HAROLD’S warning

TAYLOR
(FURIOUSLY RECOILING ROPE)
OKAY
HAROLD
Okay It’s holding
TAYLOR
Wish we had some radios
HAROLD
(NODDING and POINTING)
Weather
TAYLOR
(SHRUGS )

Ready to go again
HAROLD immediately - and bravely - readies himself
TAYLOR takes out a GAS-POWERED PITON and fires it into the rock

TAYLOR
(CLIPPING ONTO THE PITON)
Last one What the hell
(HE TAKES THE STRAIN)
Go

HAROLD falls into space and we watch nylon ROPE burn hot through
TAYLOR’S clenched GLOVES

Before all the rope has run out HAROLD is lowered over a HANGING
PRECIPICE Dangling on the rope he cannot touch the ice slope
which is just out of reach to get any purchase

BELOW HIM the slope runs steeply away for some distance after
which it abruptly disappears into a GIANT CREVASSE

HAROLD
(SCREAMING INTO THE WIND)
TAYLOR PULL ME BACK

AT THE TOP OF THE ROPE TAYLOR hangs desperately onto the belay
SHOUTING hopelessly

TAYLOR
What the hells happening H
Can you hear me You stuck

BELOW HAROLD continues to twist in the wind SHOUTING vainly--

TAYLOR is finding it hard to maintain his foothold and keep a
grip of the rope at the same time

TAYLOR
HAROLD Jesus -- I can’t
hold -- I’m losing it

HAROLD hangs desperately on flailing with his good leg to try to
swing himself across to the slope Even at the greatest extent of
his arc he is missing by at least a foot

TAYLOR meanwhile is about to fall he simply cannot maintain his
position and take the pressure on the rope any longer He is
working on the rope with the KNIFE

TAYLOR
H man -—- you’re there -
believe me -— there’s no
other way I’m gonna cut
the rope -— have to ---

BELOW The ROPE TWANGS and HAROLD suddenly drops like a stone
onto the ICE SLOPE ten feet below him

Sliding faster and faster HAROLD SCREAMS both arms furiously
flailing AXES

ABOVE HIM TAYLOR breathes a huge sigh of relief as his immediate
fate is secured He braces himself and starts coiling up the
rope methodically counting for length as he does so

TAYLOR shins down the slope counting distance as he goes

TAYLOR arrives somewhere above the CREVASSE and stares at it in
disbelief

TAYLOR
Jesus no

He moves as close as he dares to the edge and SHOUTS into it

TAYLOR
HAROLD HAROLD JAMISON

The wind alone makes it hopeless And then a MINIATURE AVALANCHE
trickles past TAYLOR on his right and this makes him look up for
more trouble Instead suspended above him he sees

Inert HAROLD crucified on the slope arms hanging from his two
axes which he has miraculously managed to drive into the snow

TAYLOR
Jesus yes HAROLD

TAYLOR races up the slope to reach HAROLD

When TAYLOR reaches HAROLD he finds him virtually unconscious
TAYLOR produces OXYGEN and applies the MASK to HAROLD’S FACE
Then TAYLOR unhooks the dazed HAROLD makes him secure on the
slope and forces him to drink

TAYLOR
Open your eyes

HAROLD
(VERY FAINTLY)
What happened

TAYLOR
I cut the rope Had to Tell you
later Now - first - STAY AWAKE

HAROLD
Huh

TAYLOR
WAKE UP TALK TO ME -

HAROLD
I’m cold Can’t feel my legs

TAYLOR
(LYING)
Good That’s a good sign H Now
Different move okay Around the
crevasse -— there - short pitches
- I lead Ready Now

TAYLOR is already ten feet away luring HAROLD to follow him down
TAYLOR

That’s right - good man
Now the other one --

105 INTEXT JACK and MALIK’S TENTGLACIER DAY 105

The tent is empty because JACK and MALIK are OUTSIDE watching the
HELICOPTER LANDING -—-
Lil

106 EXT HAROLD and TAYLORS DESCENT DAY i106

HAROLD goes first again on another long lower It proceeds
quickly and smoothly but this is more due to the easier terrain
than to his state he is delirious and seems almost not to know
where he is

Finally HAROLD comes to rest on a softsnowed ledge and almost
unconsciously signals by tugging on the rope He now collapses
onto his good side to rest and his eyes have closed even before
his head has touched the pillow

TAYLOR reaches him but can barely get HAROLD to open his eyes
He reaches into the PACK for a secret weapon a SYRINGE full of
adrenaline

TAYLOR
Not now H Were nearly there
It can’t be too far now -- I
mean — I dunno exactly where
the hell we are but - H Hey

TAYLOR injects the adrenaline into his friend’s neck and HAROLD
immediately opens his eyes wide He looks both astonished and as
though he doesn’t know where he is

HAROLD
Hey

TAYLOR
Hey

HAROLD weakly does the Victory handshake and then oh-so-wearily

prepares himself for another excruciating lower while TAYLOR
just as wearily braces himself to take the weight

107 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 107

MALIK stands beside the HELICOPTER SHOUTING something in to the
MILITARY PILOT Also shouting over the windblast

JACK
Come on We going or not

JACK looks at CLAYBORN slumped ready for takeoff in his chair
Now MALIK is SHOUTING again to the PILOT and the PILOT REPLIES

JACK
WELL

MALIK
I just ask him how much fuel
we have to look for Taylor
and Harold

JACK
What You’re out of your mind
Phillip’s almost unconscious
here We’re leaving now

MALIK
We must make just one pass

JACK
Negative You want us all to
get killed

MALIK
But they might still be alive
JACK
Not where we can get to them
Now come on give me a hand
108 EXT HAROLD and TAYLOR’S DESCENT DAY 2108

They are on an easier slope now one covered by fairly deep snow
HAROLD crawls on his hands and knees while TAYLOR sometimes does
the same sometimes manages to stagger on his feet They are
roped together again now although the effect is more symbolic
than practical Sometimes TAYLOR leads dragging HAROLD along
and sometimes the other way round

But HAROLDS injury means that inevitably he is the weaker and
he is showing definite signs of losing the fight

Eventually TAYLOR starts throwing some things out of his PACK
stuffing others into zip-flaps of his mountain suit Then he
begins to fashion a kind of SLEDGE out of the larger PACK FRAME
to which he lashes HAROLD’S body

109 EXT BASE CAMP DAY 109

MALIK is still arguing with JACK who is feeding CLAYBORN oxygen
The HELICOPTER waits but the PILOT is looking very impatient

JACK
We CANT wait The weathers
closing in -- chopper doesn’t

leave now it never will

MALIK
Then we fly one pass — just up
there One only We must just
have a look I owe that man my
life My God will never forgive
me if I do not try to save his

JACK
If they were within reach we could
see them from here If they’re
still alive - IF they’ve probably
come down on the other side of the
mountain Which is in China

MALIK
The pilot is good He will make
the attempt

JACK
Yes He will make the attempt to
get the three of us out of here
while we’ve still got a chance

MALIK
Ten minutes only

JACK
No It’s too dangerous

CLAYBORN opens his eyes he understands what is going on

MALIK
Mr Clayborn They climbed the
mountain for you You can’t leave
them to die without one look

CLAYBORN COUGHS but declines to add his weight to Malik’s cause

MALIK
Do you want to live with
FOUR deaths on your account

JACK
Help me get him into the chopper
Or else you’11 have one on yours

MALIK SHOUTS something further to the PILOT then

MALIK
I will make an official report
This will be the last American
party to K2 Ever

JACK
(TRYING TO MOVE CLAYBORN HIMSELF)
For God’s sake help me

MALIK
Help them first We must

JACK throws a desperate look at the MOUNTAIN wisps of DARK CLOUD
are already beginning to bury it then JACK looks at the
HELICOPTER PILOT who jumps down to help with the STRETCHER

As CLAYBORN is being loaded INTO THE CHOPPER

MALIK
MR CLAYBORN

JACK
Get out of the way

CLAYBORN
(CROAKILY)
Malik please Face it
Theyre dead

CU THE PILOT presses the ignition button and the ENGINE FIRES

L10 EXT HAROLD and TAYLOR’S DESCENT DAY 110

Below them there is an easier sweep of crusted snow As a new
front of ominous CLOUD begins to dirty the sky TAYLOR begins to
laboriously drag HAROLDS SLEDGE down across the brilliant slope

TAYLOR tugs HAROLD along ever more slowly His feet sink deeper
now into the snow and the black CLOUDS are racing closer

AERIAL SHOT TAYLOR and HAROLD are tiny insignificant figures on
the great white expanse of the lower reaches of the mountain

TAYLOR is still bravely hauling the sledge but his movements are
jerky now his speech slurred

ON THE SLEDGE HAROLD is unconscious or possibly even dead At
one point TAYLOR stops turns and trudges back to check on him

TAYLOR

H CMON We’re nearly there
I can feel it Know what I
think We’ve come down on the

Chinese side - yeah well
come around this next corner
-- therell be some nice old
monastery -- Taoist monks --
or NUNS Yeah Hundreds - of
crazed young Tantric Priestesses
They’11 suck your dick ‘til your
ears bleed you still got one

HAROLD’S POV Everything is blurred brilliant milky whiteness
TAYLOR’S VOICE ECHOES at once intimate and distant close and
receding

TAYLOR V0
Still here H Just give me a
sign willya I have to know
you’re still here --— HEY

li EXT HELICOPTER IN FLIGHT DAY rill

The HELICOPTER moves off down the glacier away from the mountain

112 INTEXT HELICOPTER IN FLIGHT DAY i 112

MALIK sits smoldering beside the PILOT while JACK administers
OXYGEN to CLAYBORN MALIK sticks his head out the window to see

K2 being left behind in the distance

MALIK now stares at the PILOT and at the PISTOL hanging from
his belt Without further warning MALIK snatches the PISTOL
waves it at the PILOTS HEAD and SHOUTS something in Urdu

CU CLAYBORN’S furious expression as he starts to COUGH again

113 EXT HAROLD and TAYLORS DESCENT DAY 113

TAYLOR kneels over HAROLD who remains totally inert He listens
for signs of his buddy’s breath but the wind makes it impossible
to hear anything Then TAYLOR looks up

The CLOUDS are just threatening to engulf them completely when

TAYLOR
(LISTENING KEENLY)
H Listen What’s that noise

TAYLOR strains to see through the gathering mist something some
-where is making a mysterious background THROBBING NOISE

TAYLOR
H Whatd I tell ya Huh
Wake up for chrissakes

He dives into the PACK —- produces the ROCKET FLARE and FIRES
it Immediately a PINK FLUORESCENT FLASH illuminates the slope

And then around the crest of the RIDGE just to their right the
HELICOPTER suddenly looms into view engine SCREAMING at its
absolute altitude limit

HELICOPTER POV TAYLOR dancing and pointing and waving like a man
possessed HAROLD lies still eyes closed no reaction

MALIK V0
THERE THERE TAYLOR
HAROLD

TAYLOR is blown over as the CHOPPER moves directly overhead the
dirty air driving great clouds of snow away from the two figures

ON BOARD THE CHOPPER MALIK makes ready to lower a SLING

TAYLOR
Hi Come on We fuckun’ DID it
We can have it all H - we can
REALLY TRULY BOTH have it all
- if you stop being so goddam
stubborn for one moment COME
ON H - all I’m asking for is
one — little - heart -- beat

CU HAROLD as the windblast batters his face blowing frost from
his eyebrows his eyelashes TAYLOR SCREAMING right into his ear

AND HAROLD OPENS HIS EYES

TAYLOR WHOOPS unlashes HAROLD from the SLEDGE and drags him to
his feet Supporting HAROLD with one arm TAYLOR uses his other to
grab Harold’s and raises it in a two-handed victory salute

The TWO TINY COLORED FIGURES just manage to stand upright in the
enormous windlashed white landscape
