COLD OPEN

EXT NEW YORK CITY - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

An UPBEAT SONG (eg David Bowie’s “Queen Bitch” or Vampire
Weekend’s “A-Punk”) sets the mood A SERIES OF SHOTS of New
York on a perfect morning the skyline bustling sidewalks
traffic on Fifth Avenue etc

INT THE GUYS’ APARTMENT - SETH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sun streams in through the windows A YOUNG MAN climbs out of
bed looks in the mirror and smiles It’s gonna be a good
day This is SETH PITTIFORD 28 He’s a handsome white dude
smart ambitious well-liked He’s everyone’s best friend

Seth gets ready for work A SERIES OF SHOTS He brushes his
teeth shaves combs his hair He puts on a tie and pulls a
jacket from the closet His ensemble is complete perfectly
tailored black suit white shirt black tie

INT THE GUYS’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Seth enters and finds his roommates RILEY TYTHMANN
(pronounced Tit-man) and JOHN “JUICE” CARVER both 28 Riley
is a sarcastic gay Jewish guy he’d be called lazy if he
were a member of any previous generation but since he’s not
he’s just “laid back” Juice is a handsome ambitious
athletic black guy with a fear of being seen as a stereotype

Seth does a model spin seeking their approval of his outfit
The MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY and the guys burst out LAUGHING

RILEY
Nice suit Now is that the actual
one Diane Keaton wore in “Annie
Hall” or is it just a replica

SETH
What’s wrong with the suit

JUICE

That’s a wedding suit dude Or a
funeral suit

(thinking)

The dress code for those two events
really should not be the same

SETH
It’s my first day I wanna make a
good impression
RILEY
I’m sure the other Reservoir Dogs
will love you

JUICE
It’s a tech startup dude You’1ll
be the best-dressed person there
and they’1l all think youre a
goon Is that the impression you
wanna make A goon

SETH

mother out

RILEY

It’s over

JUICE
Trust me Seth I’m black We have
excellent fashion sense

SETH
OK first of all You once referred
to white people as “we” You’re
Carlton black And second You’re
wearing jeans and plaid Not
exactly haute couture

JUICE
Everyone there’1ll be wearing this

SETH
It’s a professional office not a
lumber mill People aren’t gonna be
dressed like the Brawny man

RILEY
OK if you’re not gonna listen to
Uncle To--

Juice shoots him a look Even though they’re best friends
that’s still not an OK phrase to use Riley tries to salvage

RILEY (CONT’D)

Remus Uncle Ben Why are all the
famous uncles horrible black
stereotypes

SETH
Uncle Buck
RILEY
If you’re not gonna listen to Uncle
Buck listen to me If there’s one
thing the gays know it’s fashion
And art And restaurants And
quality premium-cable programming
And penises OK we pretty much
know everything about everything

SETH
What’s the capital of Iowa

RILEY

He eats some cereal BURPS and wipes his mouth on his shirt
which btw says “Doo-Doo Occurs” in big brown letters

SETH

(then)

I’m going with the suit
RILEY

All right fine It’s your funeral

INT THE GUYS’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

This is where we’re introduced to Barry Pittiford the 35-
year-old well-intentioned idiot He’s the opposite of his
younger brother Seth dim-witted lazy overweight sloppy
The disparity is obvious as they stand next to each other
Seth in a suit and Barry in a too-small T-shirt with a
picture of a fat sheep that says “Ewes Not Fat Ewes Fluffy”

BARRY

SETH
(reluctantly)

BARRY
(laughing)
Tit man
RILEY

BARRY
But you’re the one who’s--

Instead of saying “gay” Barry tilts his left hand side to
side the idiotic yet all-too-common gesture for “gay”

RILEY
I am indeed left-handed

BARRY
Come here ya big gay southpaw

Barry grabs Riley and gives him his signature bear hug

JUICE
(quietly to Seth)
Dude from your stories I totally
thought he was mentally challenged

SETH
Why did everyone think that

armpit He makes a disgusted face then smells again anyway

I gotta move on I guess I could
give it to the Salvation Army

Aviva LAUGHS at a text she receives Valerie notices that she
isn’t paying any attention to her and decides to test her

VALERIE (CONTD)
Or I could light the bag and myself
on fire in some sort of ritualistic
protest of the breakup Thoughts

AVIVA
Totally

Valerie playfully throws a shirt at her

VALERIE
You’re not listening to me

AVIVA
Of course I am sweetie You said
you can’t keep his stuff forever
However you feel bad throwing it
away so you’re considering
donating it to charity or barring
that self-immolating in protest

Valerie is dumbfounded Aviva reads a text and LAUGHS WILDLY

Seth Riley and Juice sit on the couch Barry stands before
them On the coffee table is a large sheet-covered box

BARRY
I wanted to get you guys something
as a thank you For the whole
apartment So while you were out I
poked around to see what you didn’t
already have By the way Juice
your keyboard was already covered
in syrup when I found it

JUICE
God dammit

BARRY
But I couldn’t think of anything to
get you And then it hit me

He pulls off the sheet revealing a cage with a FERRET in it
Juice SCREAMS at the top of his lungs terrified

RILEY SETH
No no no no no Absolutely not We do not
need a phallic rat in the
apartment

BARRY (CONT’D)
I haven’t told you the best part
His name--

(a long dramatic beat)
--is Ferrets Bueller

He looks at the guys expectantly At first there’s no
reaction Just blank stares After a LONG BEAT

RILEY
OK that’s pretty awesome

SETH
Yeah it is So I guess we have a
pet ferret now Well done Bar

Juice still terrified slowly climbs over the back of the
couch and backs away keeping his eye on Ferrets Bueller the
whole time
