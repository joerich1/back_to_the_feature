He pulls himself up and studies the beached float

NORMAN

(continuing)
Remember Chelsea trying to be on
the diving team at school Ha

his hands)
She was about this wide

He climbs up on the diving board He may take a jump
or two while they talk

ETHEL
Tsk She wasnt any such thing
She had a few fat years thats
all

NORMAN
I should say so Its no wonder
she could never do a back flip
No center of gravity

ETHEL
Wellshe tried She only did it
to please you anyway

NORMAN
I know

ETHEL
Oh Norman Wouldnt it be nice

He hesitates but finally begins to climb in The
canoe rocks and Norman stumbles

NORMAN

ETHEL

Ive thought about it

climbs aboard and theyre off
EXT LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON

getically in the bow He is faking it in the stern
The canoe consequently is veering crookedly

ON GOLDEN POND - Rev 62880 16
29 NORMAN
I dont think I1l be doing any
fishing this time around

ETHEL
All right Norman

NORMAN
No point in wasting the money
Youd think theyd give the
license free to an old case like
me Its not as though Id come
out here and deplete the entire
bass population or anything

ETHEL

You always catch your share You
always have

NORMAN
Well thats all behind me now

ETHEL

They paddle without speaking for a moment Suddenly

I had that big flashlight and I
shone it on Norman when he was
standing on the diving board all
naked Then he started screaming
at me that I was a spy and he sent
me to my room for the rest of

the year or something It took
me a long time to get over that

ETHEL
It took Norman a long time before
hed go skinny-dipping again
I remember He wouldnt get out
of the water until I went up and
made sure you were asleep I was
so mad at him for yelling at you
I let him float down here for an
hour or so
