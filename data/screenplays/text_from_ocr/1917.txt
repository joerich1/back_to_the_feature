NOTE
The following script takes place in real time and - with the
exception of one moment - is written and designed to be one single
continuous shot
EXT MEADOW - DAY APRIL 6TH 1917
A rolling landscape The rustling of leaves and birdsong
Thunder rumbles in the distance There is no rain

A figure lies against a tree eyes closed - this is
SCHOFIELD early-20s Soft features

A man is sleeping next to him on the grass - BLAKE 19
youthful strapping

SERGEANT SANDERS (0S)
Blake

Blake doesn’t stir

SERGEANT SANDERS (0S) (CONTD)
Blake

Blake wakes He’s in uniform damp and crumpled - Lance
Corporal chevrons adorn it

BLAKE
(sleepily)
Sorry Sarge

SERGEANT SANDERS
Pick a man bring your kit

BLAKE
Yes Sarge

Blake stands stiff limbs coming back to life

Schofield’s eyes are still shut Blake holds out his hand to
Schofield Schofield opens his eyes - they are gentle wise
Schofield grudgingly raises his hand for a lift

Blake heaves him to his feet - his uniform is identical to
Blake’s same rank the only difference is the brass wound
stripe on Schofield’s left sleeve

They trudge towards Sanders fastening their webbing A
smattering of SOLDIERS - same regiment - same state of
fatigue and filth lie around them Stealing sleep

SERGEANT SANDERS (0S)
Don’t dawdle

BLAKE
No Sarge

After a few paces the long grass begins to give way to well
trodden earth Washing lines appears on either side of them

Blake and Schofield move past them After a while -

BLAKE (CONTD)
Did they feed us

Schofield shakes his head he hands an envelope to Blake

SCHOFIELD
No just mail

Blake’s eyes light up at the sight of the envelope he tears
it open reads it as he walks Eyes scanning quickly his
face filling with warmth

BLAKE
(reading)
Myrtle’s having puppies

Blake finishes the note and slips it into a pocket

BLAKE (CONTD)
You get anything

SCHOFIELD
No

Schofield doesn’t seem to mind

The mess tents are now alongside Fires are stoked cooking
is underway More soldiers mill about

BLAKE
I’m bloody starving aren’t you I
thought we might get some decent
grub out here - only reason I
decided against the priesthood

Schofield lets out a laugh Blake looks on hungrily as they
pass by the mess tents

Schofield rummages in his pockets finds what he’s looking
for - a handkerchief with some food wrapped in it Blake’s
eyes fall on it hungrily

BLAKE (CONTD)
What you got there

SCHOFIELD
Ham and bread

BLAKE
Where did you find that

SCHOFIELD
I have my uses

Schofield breaks the bread in half As he does this they

move down a slope and begin to descend down into the earth
into--

EXT COMMS TRENCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS

A narrow Comms trench

SCHOFIELD
Here-

The bread is stale practically cardboard Blake’s teeth
struggle to get through it

BLAKE
(mouth full of food)
Tastes like old shoe
SCHOFIELD
Cheer up This time next week it’1l
be chicken dinner
The trench drops deeper into the earth

BLAKE
Not me Leave got cancelled

SCHOFIELD
They say why

BLAKE
No idea

A beat The world above has now disappeared

SCHOFIELD
It’s easier not to go back at all

Blake registers this - looks at him
The wider Rear Trench crosses their path Chains of soldiers

move past them - shifting crates ammunition cooking and
medical supplies

BLAKE
(looking at the soldiers)
Something’s up

Expectation is growing in Blake But Schofield looks
concerned They cut a route through the bustle

BLAKE (CONTD)
Did you hear anything

SCHOFIELD
No

BLAKE
Has to be the push right

Men carrying things push past them Blake watches

BLAKE (CONTD)
Ten bob says we’re going up

SCHOFIELD
I’m not taking that bet

BLAKE
Why ‘Cos you know I’m right

SCHOFIELD
No ‘Cos you haven’t got ten bob

Blake laughs

They follow Sanders into-

EXT SECOND TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
They turn into a wider second line trench

SERGEANT SANDERS
In your own time gentlemen

Up ahead Sanders waits
Blake and Schofield put on speed catch Sanders

BLAKE
Is there news Sarge

SERGEANT SANDERS
News of what

BLAKE
The big push It was supposed to
happen weeks ago They told us wed
be home by Christmas

SERGEANT SANDERS
(mild sarcasm)
Yes well sorry to disrupt your
crowded schedule Blake but the
Brass Hats didn’t fancy it in the
snow

BLAKE
More’s the pity Sarge I could have
done with some turkey

SERGEANT SANDERS
Well I’1l make sure to relay your
displeasure to command

Ahead and above them is a web of telegraph wires - stretching
overhead and along the trench THREE ROYAL ENGINEERS are
working on them tagging and testing They duck around them

SCHOFIELD
So what’s on the cards then
Sergeant

SERGEANT SANDERS
The Hun are up to something

SCHOFIELD
Any idea what

SERGEANT SANDERS
No - but it’s bound to ruin our
weekend

Sanders turns a corner and comes to a stop Just beyond him
is the dark yawning mouth of a Dugout

SERGEANT SANDERS (CONTD)
Now listen Erinmore is inside so
tidy yourselves up

They are suddenly alert

SERGEANT SANDERS (CONTD)
You never know - might be mentions
in dispatches for this one if you
don’t bugger it up

Sanders gives them a look and disappears inside the dugout

Schofield quickly buttons up his tunic hiding any sins there
may be underneath

Blake nervously tidies himself leans in to Schofield
BLAKE
Must be something big if the

General’s here

They enter

INT DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS

Lit by paraffin lamps it takes Schofield a moment for his
eyes to adjust to the half-light He and Blake hand their
rifles to the ORDERLIES salute and stand at attention

There is a simmering sense of unease in this place
In the centre of the room there are two tables On one table

lie several maps on the other are a number of large aerial
reconnaissance photographs

GENERAL ERINMORE (50s) LIEUTENANT GORDON (40s) and a CAPTAIN
are gathered around the far table looking down at the
aerials talking in hushed tones

Other men watch from the shadows - TWO NCOs and ANOTHER
ORDERLY

SERGEANT SANDERS
Lance Corporals Blake and
Schofield Sir

General Erinmore turns around Looks at Blake and Schofield

GENERAL ERINMORE
Which one of you is Blake

BLAKE
Sir

ERINMORE
You have a brother a Lieutenant in
the 2nd Devons

BLAKE
Yes sir Joseph Blake Is he-

ERINMORE
Alive as far as I know And with
your help I’d like to keep it that
way

Blake stares at Erinmore he would do anything

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Sanders tells me you’re good with
maps That true

BLAKE
Good enough Sir

ERINMORE
So

Erinmore turns the map to face Blake The British lines are
marked in blue the German lines in red

ERINMORE (CONTD)
We are here The 2nd Devons are
advancing here

He points out a cross on the map at Croisilles Wood

ERINMORE (CONTD)
How long will it take you to get
there

Blake hesitantly studies it Croisilles Wood sits in the
centre of a huge area of land which is scored as occupied
territory

BLAKE
I don’t understand Sir

SCHOFIELD
Sir that land is held by the
Germans

ERINMORE
Germans have gone

Shock plays on their faces

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Don’t get your hopes up It appears
to be a strategic withdrawal They
seem to have created a new line
nine miles back here by the looks
of it

Erinmore runs his finger along the massed red lines of the
German trenches and fortifications newly drawn on the map

The new German Line - what came to be known as the Hindenburg
Line - is huge and cuts its way across the paper almost
intersecting with Croisilles Wood

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Colonel Mackenzie is in command of
the 2nd He sent word yesterday
morning that he was going after the
retreating Germans He is convinced
he has them on the run - that if he
can break their lines now he will
turn the tide He is wrong

Schofield watches Blake as he begins to register what this
might mean

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Colonel Mackenzie has not seen
these aerials of the enemy’s new
line

Erinmore turns to the other table

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Come round here Gentlemen

Blake and Schofield move to the next table They look down at
the large aerial photographs

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Three miles deep Field
fortifications defences and
artillery the like of which we’ve
never seen before

Beat

ERINMORE (CONTD)
The 2nd are due to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow They
have no idea what they are in for
And we can’t warn them - as a
parting gift the enemy cut all our
telephone lines

Blake and Schofield are silent while they take this in

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Your orders are to get to the 2nd
at Croisilles Wood one mile south
east of the town of Ecoust

Erinmore hands over an envelope to Blake We see the
distinctive red stamp of Army Command

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Deliver this to Colonel Mackenzie
It is a direct order to call off
tomorrow morning’s attack

Erinmore speaks slowly desperate to impress upon Blake and
Schofield the gravity of this situation Nothing can be
misunderstood

ERINMORE (CONTD)
If you don’t it will be a
massacre We would lose two
battalions Sixteen hundred men
your brother among them

Schofield hides his shock But Blake looks at Erinmore
determination etched in his face understood

ERINMORE (CONTD)
Do you think you can get there in
time

BLAKE
Yes Sir

ERINMORE
Any questions

BLAKE
No Sir

Schofield eyes flick to Blake No questions Blake purposely
doesn’t catch Schofield’s eye

ERINMORE
Good Over to you Lieutenant

The men salute Erinmore Lieutenant Gordon stands to one
side

LIEUTENANT GORDON
Supplies Gentlemen

Lt Gordon nods them over to a table Various items are laid
out on it

LIEUTENANT GORDON (CONTD)
Map torches grenades and a
couple of little treats

They look A folded map two electric torches two grenades
and two small packs of Huntley and Palmer biscuits lie on the
table They take them and start hastily putting them into
their webbing While they do

LIEUTENANT GORDON (CONTD)
Leave immediately take this trench
west up on Sauchiehall Street
then north west on Paradise Alley
at the front Continue along the
front line until you find the
Yorks

Gordon slides a note into Blake’s top pocket

LIEUTENANT GORDON (CONTD)
Give this note to Major Stevenson
He’s holding the line at the
shortest span of No Man’s Land
Youll cross there

Both men turn at the mention of No Man’s Land
SCHOFIELD
It will be daylight Sir They’1ll
see us
ERINMORE (0C)
No need to be concerned You should
meet no resistance
An Orderly hands them back their rifles

Blake moves towards the doorway Schofield turns to Erinmore

SCHOFIELD
Sir is it just us

Erinmore looks up

ERINMORE
“Down to Gehenna or up to the
Throne

(MORE )

ERINMORE (CONTD)
He travels the fastest who travels
alone
Wouldn’t you say Lieutenant

LIEUTENANT GORDON
Yes Sir I would

The General looks at them levelly

ERINMORE
Good luck

Blake and Schofield turn and head through the door-

EXT SECOND LINE TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

Schofield’s eyes wince in the daylight A small curved branch
leads from the rear of the dugout back to the Second Line

SCHOFIELD
Blake - let’s talk about this for a
minute

BLAKE
Why

Blake is already off moving fast

Schofield moves after him trying to fill and fasten his
webbing as he goes

SCHOFIELD
Blake

Blake begins to move faster setting a punishing pace Boots
clattering over the wooden boards

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
We just need to think about it-

BLAKE
-There’s nothing to think about
It’s my big brother

Schofield runs to catch up he falls in behind Blake
breathing heavy

SCHOFIELD

We should at least wait till it’s
dark-

BLAKE
Erinmore said to leave immediately

SCHOFIELD
Erinmore’s never seen No Mans
Land We won’t make it ten yards
If we just wait-

BLAKE
You heard him He said the Boche
have gone

SCHOFIELD
Is that why he gave us grenades

The Second line runs through a small row of derelict railway
cottages Braziers have been lit men mill around queueing to
collect their rations

Schofield and Blake push themselves to the edge of the trench
to get around the crush

Blake is through and clear but Schofield bumps into a
Sergeant

SERGEANT
Watch where you’re going

SCHOFIELD
Sorry

Blake keeps pace Schofield jogs to catch him

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
All I’m saying is that we wait

BLAKE
Yes you would say that because
it’s not your brother is it

Schofield moves alongside Blake again grabs his arm

SCHOFIELD
Look the last time I was told the
Germans were gone it didn’t end
well

Blake shakes him off and pushes his way forward squeezing

in and out of the lines of traffic - His shoulder and pack
battering against MEN as he passes them

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
You don’t know Blake you weren’t
there

Ahead a group of men are bunched up collecting mail and
parcels from the post bag Gumming up the trench

BLAKE
Excuse me Excuse me

Blake and Schofield squeeze past them

Another junction A painted sign “SAUCHIEHALL STREET” points
to a smaller branching comms line Blake turns up it
Schofield follows-

EXT SAUCHIEHALL LINE (COMMS “DOWN” TRENCH)- CONTINUOUS

Much narrower Blake pushes onwards going against the
direction of the traffic Schofield follows after him single
file increasingly frustrated Soldiers buffet against them

A Sergeant snarls at them

SERGEANT MILLER
Youre going up a down trench you
bloody idiots

BLAKE
Orders of the General Sir

Schofield follows catching the ire from the men Blake has
just passed He checks his watch

SCHOFIELD
Alright say the Boche have gone
Nine miles will take us what six
hours Eight at the very most So
weve got time to wait until the
sun sets Otherwise we’ll be wide
open-

BLAKE
-It’s enemy territory we’ve got no
idea what we’re walking into-

SCHOFIELD
-Blake if we’re not clever about
this no one will get to your
brother

BLAKE
I will

Blake’s tone indicates that this is the end of the
conversation

They are approaching a junction They slow down A flicker of
fear on both of their faces

SCHOFIELD
We’re here This is the front line
EXT PARADISE (FRONT LINE) TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
The Front Line
A sign hangs on the junction wall PARADISE ALLEY Just
visible above the trench wall to the front is an endless line

of wire

BLAKE
Now we need to find the Yorks

There is an eeriness here a sudden smothering silence

Blake looks around Trying to work out which way is North
West

Blake heads in that direction moving fast again Schofield
follows alongside him

The trench stretches away from them in a long line
Duckboards slick with mud mark out a path

There are many men here and many pairs of eyes watch from
the shadows of dugouts

Crudely painted signs are strung up along the walls dire
warnings We catch glimpses as Blake and Schofield pass

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN IN DAYLIGHT ENEMY SNIPERS AT PLAY

They walk single file down the Front Line

TWO STRETCHER BEARERS are heading towards them A MAN carried
between them Schofield drops back looks down The man is
unconscious his face bandaged - two red bloodstains in place

of eyes

Fear is rooting itself in Schofield He fights it

Schofield looks up he’s briefly lost sight of Blake round
the next bend He moves to catch up He hears voices

PRIVATE STOKES (0S)
Here watch who you’re shoving

BLAKE (0S)
Get out of the way then

Schofield’s puts on speed quickly pushes aside the soldier
in front of him

He makes his way to Blake three SOLDIERS have surrounded
him One PRIVATE STOKES - a large red-haired bruiser with
tattoos on his forearms - is gripping Blake’s tunic Blake
has him by the collar Both are angry Blake is on the verge
of tears

BLAKE (CONTD)
Let go

PRIVATE STOKES
Fuck you think you are pushing
wounded men around

Schofield is quickly into the fray putting himself in
between Blake and the Private

BLAKE
Let go of me

SCHOFIELD
Stop

PRIVATE STOKES
Arsehole knocked our Sergeant down
the man’s fucking wounded-

Beside them an NCO with a sling on is being helped out of
the mud

BLAKE
Alright I’m sorry alright I’m
sorry
Blake struggles to get free tears of frustration well in his
eyes Schofield sees this realises Blake is on the verge of
losing control

The Private’s hand balls into a fist his anger simmering

Schofield gets between them

SCHOFIELD
We’re on commission Orders from
the General

BLAKE
Let me through

Stokes stops
SCHOFIELD
(levelly)
Get out of the way

PRIVATE STOKES
Right Just watch where you’re
going

The other men move aside to give them a passage through

They keep moving Schofield is a step behind Blake he steals
glances at him concerned

The two men walk on the silence heavier After a while -

SCHOFIELD
It’s bloody quiet

A beat Blake looks at Schofield

BLAKE
Was it like this before Thiepval

The name does something to Schofield Fear clings to him He
pushes it away

SCHOFIELD
I don’t remember

BLAKE
You don’t remember the Somme

SCHOFIELD
Not really

BLAKE

Well you did alright out of it At
least wear your ribbon

Beat

SCHOFIELD
Don’t have it anymore

They push on round the next bend

BLAKE
What You lost your medal

Before he can answer the trench suddenly expands - the back
wall has been blown out into a large crater Debris and
sandbags are strewn around A small team of DIGGERS work on
it with picks and shovels breaking up the earth pulling out
body parts from the mud putting them in empty sandbags

SCHOFIELD
Stay low

Schofield climbs over the rubble and sandbags crushing his
body to keep his head below the front parapet

Blake follows One of the diggers turns to Schofield his
voice a harsh whisper

NCO HARVEY
Gods sake Careful there you’re
stepping on the dead

Schofield looks at the sandbag 15 inches by 25 Red is
rusting through it

NCO HARVEY (CONTD)
That’s our Sergeant -

Schofield quickly moves off the bag

NCO HARVEY (CONTD)
Be better washing them out of this
dugout with a bloody hose

BLAKE
Do you know where the Yorks are

NCO HARVEY
The next bend you’ll be standing on
top of half of them Shot to hell
two nights ago

Blake and Schofield continue They slip round a bend and into
a small bay

They stop by two men - one is burning the lice from his

clothes with a lighter Another BUCHANAN sits against the
back wall a small dog on his lap

SCHOFIELD
Yorks

Buchanan nods

PRIVATE BUCHANAN
Yes Corp

BLAKE
Where’s Major Stevenson

PRIVATE BUCHANAN
Killed a couple of nights ago
Corporal Lieutenant Leslie has
command

BLAKE
Where can we find him

Buchanan nods down the line

PRIVATE BUCHANAN
Next dug-out
They round the bend and spot the dugout It has been badly
shelled but patched and re-built A fire is lit in a brazier
just outside the door Inside a provisions bag and a few
other wooden items hang from a rafter out of reach of the
rats

SCHOFIELD
Here

LT LESLIE is asleep on a small camp bed his arm over his
eyes A couple of ORDERLIES sit or lie nearby

They approach the sleeping Leslie

BLAKE
Sir

He doesn’t stir Blake speaks louder

BLAKE (CONTD)
Lieutenant Leslie Sir

Leslie stirs a little he doesn’t move his arm from his eyes

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
What is it

BLAKE
We have a message from General
Erinmore

Leslie looks up his face shines with sweat his voice is
croaky full of flu a little delirious

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Are you our relief

Schofield shakes his head

SCHOFIELD
No Sir

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Then when the fucking hell are they
due

BLAKE
We don’t know Sir But we’ve got
orders to cross here

Blake offers the letter
Leslie sits up Looks at them queerly

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
That is the German front line

BLAKE
We know Sir If you’ll just take
the letter-

Blake hands over Erinmore’s letter Leslie sighs tears it
open and reads quickly

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
(as he reads)
Settle a bet what day is it

SCHOFIELD
Friday

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Friday Well well well None of
us was right This idiot thought it
was Tuesday

(off the letter)

Are they out of their fucking
minds

(MORE)

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
One slow night and the brass think
the Hun have just gone home

SCHOFIELD
(looking at Blake)
Do you think they’re wrong Sir

LIEUTENANT LESLIE

We lost an officer and three men
two nights ago They were shot to
bits patching up wire We dragged
two of them back here Needn’t have

bothered

Blake is determined to press on

BLAKE
Sir the General is sure the enemy
have withdrawn There are aerials
of the new line-

Leslie gets to his feet

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Shut up We’ve fought and died over
every inch of this fucking place
now they suddenly give us miles

Schofield turns and stares at Blake

Blake won’t meet his eye

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
It’s a trap

Leslie leans in to Schofield

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
But chin up There’s a medal in it
for sure Nothing like a scrap of
ribbon to cheer up a widow
Schofield stares at him like he would lift him out of his
boots with one punch
LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
Alright

Leslie walks out of the dugout As he walks-—

BLAKE
Where’s the nearest way through
Sir

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Our wire’s a mess But there is a
path through Of sorts

He leads them a few paces to a small dead-end lookout trench
half earth half corrugated steel At the end of it is a
rudimentary periscope

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
(to the soldier)
Rushworth Let him look

The soldier manning it steps away to allow them to look
Blake presses his eye to the lens

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
Straight ahead to the left past
the dead horses-

Blake squints moves the periscope While Blake does this
Leslie lights a cigarette his hands shaking

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
There’s a gap directly behind them
Useful because if it’s dark you
follow the stench When you get to
the second wire look out for the
bowing chap There’s small break
just beside him

As Blake scans the terrain with the periscope Schofield
methodically prepares himself

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
The German line is a hundred and
fifty odd yards after that Watch
out for the craters They’re deeper
than they look You fall in
there’s no getting out

Leslie indicates for them to follow

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
This way

Leslie kicks at a sleeping PRIVATE KILGOUR as he walks

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
Wake up Kilgour
(to himself)
Bloody waste of space

SCHOFIELD
Any cover Sir Anywhere to jump
off from

Leslie leads them to a wide ladder leaning against the trench
wall

LIEUTENANT LESLIE
No The sap trench was blown to
hell weeks ago It’s full of bodies
anyway Your best bet is to pop
over here

Blake and Schofield stop by the ladder ready themselves
checking and loading their rifles fixing their bayonets

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
If you do get shot try to make it
back to the wire We won’t come
after you not until it’s dark
And if by some fucking miracle you
do make it send up a flare

SCHOFIELD
Don’t have any Sir

Leslie gestures impatiently to a nearby PRIVATE KILGOUR
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
Well get him one Kilgour Make

yourself useful

PRIVATE KILGOUR
Yes Sir

Kilgour goes to fetch the flare gun Leslie amuses himself
LIEUTENANT LESLIE
(sprinkling whisky on the men)
“Through this holy unction may the
Lord pardon thee whatever sins or
faults thou hast committed”

Leslie laughs mirthlessly Schofield and Blake try to stay
focused

Kilgour hands Leslie a flare pistol and two cartridges

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
I do hate losing these to the Hun
So when they start shooting at you
could you be so kind as to throw it
back there’s a good chap

Blake tucks the flare and cartridges into his pack

LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONTD)
Cheerio

Leslie steps back A crowd of MEN have now gathered behind
him to watch Blake and Schofield their faces a combination
of shock and fascination

Blake and Schofield climb onto the firing step

Schofield looks at Blake speaks quietly to him

SCHOFIELD
You sure

Blake isn’t But he nods

BLAKE
Yes

Blake goes to climb over Schofield stops him

SCHOFIELD
Age before beauty

Schofield takes a deep breath and goes first He puts one
hand over the parapet Then the other

Slowly he advances up his head inching over the protection
of the trench His hand is shaking he drives it into the
mud grasping for purchase

Everyone is still breathless listening for the enemy to
fire

Schofield drags his body up and over into -

EXT NO MANS LAND - CONTINUOUS

Vast almost unbearably open after the close quarters of the
trench

A light mist hangs low over the land

The ground is treacle-like Schofield’s hands and knees sink
into it as he pulls himself forward his eyes are trained
through the British wire towards the German lines

The whole world is lunar and empty Earth pounded to atoms
all mounds and holes

Nothing moves Nothing lives

The only sound is Blake’s breathing as he heaves himself out
of the trench beside Schofield

Both men are still for a beat Hunched down low on their
knees two nocturnal animals caught in the daylight

British wire runs in loops ahead of them tangled and
haphazardly strung A mess to navigate through

They get to their feet and move forwards over the slick
earth towards the putrid remains of the horses Breathing
through their mouths trying to deal with the stench

A layer of black fur covers the animals as Schofield and
Blake close in on them they see the fur is actually flies
hundreds of them

Schofield moves past the remains and through the first break
in the wire The path is pocked with craters and puddles
shrapnel litters everything

Blake follows Schofield through the channel - ahead on the
second wire is “the bowing chap” - a GERMAN SOLDIER dead
bent double over the wire one arm outstretched in a courtly
manner as if bowing

Schofield doesn’t linger on the dead German doesn’t look at
his face He focuses on the task at hand To the side of the
man is a small gap in the razor wire easy to miss without
the landmark Schofield struggles to further pull apart the
dense tangle of wire He indicates for Blake to pass through

As he does so Schofield slips in the mud His hand
instinctively closes around the wire It slices into his
palm hooking into his flesh

Bright red seeps along his hand he wrenches it back tearing
the skin to free himself A heavy breath hisses out of him
He balls his hand into a fist to stem the bleeding

BLAKE (0C)
You alright

Blake looks at him with concern Schofield nods that he’s
fine

SCHOFIELD
Look for cover

Everything after here is unnatural land Craters are gouged
out of the earth There is a rise and fall to this stretch
but no flow or reason to it

About a hundred yards from them in the distance is an
artificial horizon something grey mesh-like stretching the
entire length of the land - The German Wire Occasional dead
trees dot the land beyond

Blake goes into the closest crater He looks to Schofield
some silent communication Schofield’s eyes pull out a path
where there isn’t one

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Sap trench

Schofield goes first crouching low moving faster now
picking his way towards a hole in the earth

And then jumps directly into the old sap trench

Blown out and neglected it is now little more than a ditch
but it offers a stretch of cover

Schofield checks his wounded hand It pulses blood He feels
as if he is being watched He looks around

Next to him is the body of a German soldier face down in the
mud rats are on the corpse feasting

Blake jumps into the sap just next to Schofield He lands
right next to A DEAD MAN looking straight at them He is
sitting up his lips and eyes have been chewed off by rats
White teeth grin in a pale face

Blake reflexively scrambles back in horror knocking into
Schofield Schofield slips reaches out to steady himself
and grabs at the first thing he finds - the BODY OF THE
GERMAN

Schofield’s wounded hand lands on the man’s back and sinks -
right through

Schofield’s cut hand goes into the putrid flesh

Beside him Blake is frozen Panicking

Schofield gestures to him - ‘stay calm’ Blake tries to
steady himself

They move further along the side of the sap trench Schofield
peers out About eighty yards now to the German wire

They gather themselves Schofield takes the lead He pulls
himself out of the sap Blake follows

They move crouched low Watching Waiting for guns to open
on them

Silence
The land is flatter here There is an eerie feeling of
emptiness and silence Schofield and Blake keep moving

forwards trying to stay focused Crouching to keep low

The mud is like oil but some things are solid underfoot
Outlines of guns shrapnel unexploded shells bodies

Suddenly a loud sound approaching
TWO PLANES
Blake and Schofield both move quickly to the nearest shell-
hole They throw themselves in and freeze Keeping the brims
of their helmets low hiding their faces from the planes
above Blending in to the landscape around them
SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
(Sotto)
Stay still

The engines grow louder The planes fly close overhead and
then begin to recede into the distance

Both men now turn their heads to look at them
SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
(Sotto)
They’re ours
Blake nods
SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
(Sotto)
Keep going We’re half way

They move back out into the open expanse

Large shell holes appear on either side of them They pick
their way through them balancing carefully along the ridges

They climb to the top of a small hillock and suddenly on the
other-side - vertigo The ground falls away steeply in a mine
crater stories deep

They look down into it

BLAKE
There’s a gap in the wire

We can see the base of the crater The nearest line of German
wire has been split by the blast and hangs limply down the
side wall of the crater the other half of it disappears into
a huge pool of water at its base

They meet each other’s gaze An obvious way through the wire
It’s clear they need to go down into the crater

They slide carefully down the steep bank

At the base of the crater the water is fathomless - the

colour of mucus and the same consistency A DEAD GERMAN
£

loats in it bloated

Blake follows in Schofield’s exact footsteps walking around
the edge of the pool

Blake looks into the pool Things float in it Bodies The
pages of a letter a cigarette tin a water canteen

Ahead of them halfway up the far bank another line of German
wire - the main one - is suspended across the crater There
is a gap beneath the wire

They climb up the far bank towards the gap Blake is
struggling

BLAKE (CONTD)
Sco

Schofield helps him up the slope

The main German wire is a huge thicket of razor wire denser
than a hedgerow Using their hands they dig into the muddy
sides of the crater and pull themselves upwards through the
German wire

Schofield looks - close to him caught on the wire a small
clump of human hair blows in the breeze

Hands and bayonets digging deep into the muddy bank they
haul themselves out of the crater Ahead of them is the

German Front Line

BLAKE (CONTD)
There That’s the front line

They lift their rifles and aim them towards the German line

Blake moves first He quickly approaches the German trench
Schofield is next to him

Both men suck in a breath and stand tall leaning over the
German sandbags

Their rifles sweep in unison down the length of the trench
Empty Schofield turns to Blake

BLAKE (CONTD)
Fuck me They really have gone

They look around in awe - this trench is massive
fortified and seemingly abandoned Intermittent shell
holes have levelled large sections

Blake and Schofield drop down into the trench

EXT GERMAN FRONT LINE TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

This trench is better crafted than the British trench Deeper
and well reinforced and eerily empty They are alone

To one side the trench is smashed in A mountain of earth and
debris Blocked

Schofield crouches attends to his bleeding hand Blood oozes
out of it

BLAKE
Your hand alright

SCHOFIELD
Put it through an effing German

Schofield has taken out his canteen he pours water on his
sliced up palm Blake keeps watch

BLAKE

Patch it up You’1l be wanking
again in no time

SCHOFIELD
Wrong hand

Blake laughs

Blake moves off rifle ready Schofield follows wrapping a
bandage round his hand as they move He tightens the dressing
with his teeth Red seeps through the white gauze

Ahead of them is a brazier full of spent white coal dust
Blake kicks it over the white dust crumbles red embers glow
- wisps of smoke Still smouldering

Schofield turns to Blake his eyes are on the embers too

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
They’re not long gone

Blake hands tighten on his rifle he pushes off heading east
down-
EXT GERMAN COMMS TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

Blake leads them into the deep narrow trench Creeping
forward quickly eyes darting ahead looking for any enemy

The comms trench opens out into-

EXT GERMAN SECOND LINE TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

Blake hovers by the mouth of the comms trench peeking out
Another dead end

BLAKE
No good

Schofield is at his back Their eyes scan the empty second
line trench

They push on in silence

Their footsteps click and echo over the duckboards They
move bayonets pointed forward

The trench takes a sharp turn Schofield and Blake inch
round rifles up checking

Ahead of them the trench is destroyed A direct hit Earth

sandbags and huge splinters of timber jut out of the pile of
dirt

SCHOFIELD
Blocked

It is impassable

Next to them is the mouth of a dugout A doorway
Blake peers into the darkness

Timber stairs descend two storeys down into the earth

BLAKE
This might be a way through

They click on their torches and move down the stairs
Whole tree trunks have been used to reinforce the walls They
share a look The sophistication of the Germans amazes them

At the foot of the steps Blake turns the corner

BLAKE (0S) (CONTD)
Jesus

Schofield follows him quickly the timber creaks under him as
he rounds into the mouth of-

INT GERMAN DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS
He turns the corner and sees Blake torch in hand

BLAKE
Look at this It’s massive

The dugout is huge - an entire barracks carved out of the
chalky earth It’s ghostly in the torch light

Timber struts run along walls and ceilings Rows of bunk beds
run along the length of the huge room stacked up to the
ceiling

BLAKE (CONTD)
They built all this

Blake and Schofield move through it their torchlights
slicing through the darkness It is palatial compared with
what we have seen on the British lines

Schofield’s eyes land on something - a photograph someone’s

wife and child pinned to a bed frame Schofield stares at it
for a beat

Blake noses through some of the detritus left behind by the
Germans then moves through into

The Officer’s Quarters Iron bed frames an arm chair a
desk In one corner are the remains of a cooking area some
boxes of supplies lie abandoned

Next to one of the beds a tunnel stretches away from him into
the darkness

SCHOFIELD
Here’s our way through

BLAKE (0C)
Sco - how about this

Schofield turns to see Blake sitting on one of the officers’
beds bouncing gently The springs squeak loudly in the
silence he grins Then movement catches his eye A massive
rat gnaws on a canvass sack suspended form the roof beams

BLAKE (CONTD)
Bloody hell Even their rats are
bigger than ours

By the light of their torches they can see a large bloated
rat moving quickly along one of the roof beams

Their torches follow the rat as it scampers along the beam
The light catches more canvas sacks all suspended from a the
ceiling Grease is pooling at the base of them turning them
translucent - bags of food or at least an approximation of
it Other frayed and empty canvas sacks lie around

BLAKE (CONTD)
What do you think’s in the bags

SCHOFIELD
You cannot be that hungry

Blake thinks for a beat
The rat makes a leap for one dropping from the rafter to the
canvas The bag swings violently under the rat’s weight a

pendulum in the middle of the room

BLAKE
Look at him Cocky little bastard

Something has caught Schofield’s eye A crate full of food

tins has been left in the corner Schofield walks over and
grabs one

SCHOFIELD
You could eat this though

He turns to read the writing in Blake’s torch light
“Fleischkonserve”

BLAKE
What is it

Schofield tosses a tin across the room to him Blake catches
it reads the label

SCHOFIELD
Boche dog meat

BLAKE
What’s in the other boxes

Schofield goes for the other crate and freezes

BLAKE (CONTD)
What’s wrong

SCHOFIELD
Trip wire

Blake stands stock still

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Don’t move

The two men are frozen

BLAKE
Where is it

SCHOFIELD
Goes from here to the door

Blake’s breath quickens as he scans the room trying to pick
out the wire in the torchlight The door is about ten feet
away

Suddenly -

BAM

Both men jump - The rat and the canvas bag are on the floor

BLAKE
Jesus

The rat is dragging the canvas bag towards the door to the
next room desperate to keep its treasure from the two men

BLAKE (CONTD)
Nono —-

Blake’s eyes go wide he starts forward for the rat-

The rat lets go of the bag and flees - into the wire A flash
of blinding light then almost simultaneously-

BOOM

Impossibly loud The blast is reflected back in off the solid
walls a section of roof drops Dirt and chalk dust blast
outward

Blake is flung backwards against the wall with a thud

White chalk dust swirls in the room bright in the
torchlight Blake’s torch lands on the floor beam pointing
upwards at the ceiling

For a second there is silence

Blake begins to pant The wind is knocked out of him He
catches his breath

He feels his head reaches for his torch His eyes scan the
room

His torchlight slices through the dust and smoke The world
has been turned over Some parts are buried And where
Schofield was standing - a pile of rubble

Panic streaks across his face

Then there is a sound Muffled from deep in the white dirt
Screaming

Schofield is buried

Blake is on his feet staggering towards the mound of chalk
and dust Moving over it ears to the dirt listening

Schofield’s screams slip through it
Blake frantically begins to dig

BLAKE (CONTD)
Sco

Ripping earth away from one spot then listening to
Schofield’s muffled screams and moving to another

Desperation on his face

BLAKE (CONTD)
sco

The screams are getting weaker Disappearing beneath the
sounds of the timber creaking and groaning

Blake swims through the earth sweeping it away-
Schofield’s screams stop
Blake thrashes in the chalk - at last unearths -

Lips Schofield’s mouth wide open filled with pale grey
dirt Still

BLAKE (CONTD)
sco sco

Blake tears the chalk away from his mouth and nose and
suddenly Schofield heaves into life retches coughing up
dirt sawing in breaths

Blake uncovers Schofield’s face his eyes are packed with
dirt and chalk Blake keeps digging frees Schofield’s arm
chest Schofield thrashes in the debris trying to free
himself He can’t It’s too tightly packed

BLAKE (CONTD)
Sco Wake up Wake up Sco

Blake grabs at Schofield’s arm and with all his might
wrenches him out of the dirt

BLAKE (CONTD)
Sco Stand up Stand up Up UP

Schofield is in shock - numb Caked in the pale white earth
His heaves and retches fill the tiny space His body shaking
and contorting with shock

BLAKE (CONTD)
STAND UP

The timber is groaning all around them now Blake looks up at
it

BLAKE (CONTD)
The whole thing’s coming down

As Blake looks the chalk dust swirls in the air drawn
towards the tunnel entrance sucked out by the backdraft
Their way out
Blake stands half-drags Schofield to his feet Schofield can
hardly see out of his dust-filled eyes Blake pulls him over

to the tunnel entrance

BLAKE (CONTD)
You keep hold of me
INT GERMAN TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
Carved through the chalk bedrock Seven feet high and
reinforced with timber some of which have already split in
the blast The tunnel slopes gently down deeper into the
earth White walls reflect Blake’s torch

The earth around them groans silt and dust piss from the
ceiling

Schofield coughs and convulses grasping on to Blake towed
along in his wake

The tunnel splits one fork has been destroyed Blake pulls
them forward the only way they can go

BLAKE
We need to keep moving Come on

SCHOFIELD
I can’t see - I can’t see

Blake stops suddenly

BLAKE
Stop Stop

He has kicked a bucket that sits on the lip of a mineshaft
The bucket drops into the hole pulleys spinning ferociously

BLAKE (CONTD)
Stop It’s a mineshaft

Blake looks for a way round it It has been blown by the
Germans

BLAKE (CONTD)
Well have to jump Come on

Blake jumps across it Schofield is frozen

BLAKE (CONTD)
Youre going to have to jump Just
jump

SCHOFIELD
I can’t- I can’t see

Blake wheels around and shines his light on Schofield

Schofield’s eyes stream with tears and debris he’s
paralyzed blinded

Between them is nothing but a gaping hole in the floor
fathomless blackness

The walls around them groan under the strain The place is
coming down

BLAKE
You need to trust me Jump

Schofield tears in a breath then leaps forwards towards
Blake

Schofield takes off jumps across the hole and lands hard
His back foot slips down the side of the mineshaft but Blake
grabs him and heaves him up

Blake pushes forward Schofield clings to him

BLAKE (CONTD)
Don’t let go of me Don’t let go

The sound of earth collapsing suddenly fills the tunnel The
dugout behind them has collapsed in

Ahead there is a fork in the tunnel Blake spots something to
his right - a blue haze

Daylight
He pulls Schofield towards it

BLAKE (CONTD)
Light There’s light

They scramble forwards Light begins to flood the passage
way They reach the end of the tunnel and stumble out into
the light

EXT REAR GERMAN TRENCHES - CONTINUOUS

Blake scrambles down a small incline scanning for enemy
They are in a large sunken ditch

Schofield stands bent double at the mouth of the tunnel
trying to catch his breath Both of them are covered with
chalk dust They look like pale ghosts

SCHOFIELD
Stop stop Justjust let me
stand

BLAKE

Dirty bastards
Schofield gathers himself and drops down beside Blake

Blake pushes on climbing up a small rise rifle ready
Schofield goes after him shakily

BLAKE (CONTD)
Careful they may have left other
traps

Blake crests the small berm and looks

Curving away from him - a quarry A huge desolate
amphitheatre

The quarry is several storeys high Holes and entrances are
carved all over it like rabbit warrens

Scattered around is the detritus of war Several huge German
guns and some small artillery lie damaged and abandoned
Small mountains of brass - thousands of spent shell casings

BLAKE (CONTD)
Jesus

Blake sweeps his rifle around searching for any threat This
place is abandoned

Schofield makes it to the top of the berm and drops down to
the ground trying to clean out his eyes

SCHOFIELD
Dust so much dust in my eyes

He empties the remaining water from his canteen onto his
face

Blake approaches Schofield hands him his canteen Schofield
washes the chalk off of his face

BLAKE
Here Have some of mine

Blake crouches beside him He watches him concerned

BLAKE (CONTD)
I wish I’d shot that rat now

Schofield turns on him sharp

SCHOFIELD
And I wish you’d picked some other
bloody idiot

BLAKE
What

SCHOFIELD
Why in God’s name did you have to
choose me

Schofield checks his pockets - takes out small tobacco tin
Checks inside it His hands are shaking badly

BLAKE
I didn’t know what I was picking
you for

SCHOFIELD

No you didn’t You never know
That’s your problem

Blake is stung
BLAKE
Alright then go back Nothing’s
stopping you You can go all the
way bloody home if you want
At the mention of home Schofield turns on him sharply

SCHOFIELD
Don’t

A beat Schofield puts the tobacco tin back in his pocket

BLAKE

(calmer now)
Look I didn’t know what I was
picking you for I thought they
were going to send us back up the
line or for food or something I
thought it was going to be
something easy alright I never
thought it would be this

A beat

BLAKE (CONTD)
So do you want to go back

Schofield looks at him softening

SCHOFIELD
Just fire the fucking flare

He loads and lifts the flare and looks back towards the
British lines

BLAKE
(under his breath)
Up yours Lieutenant

He fires it straight up The light streaks through the sky
He watches it drop

Blake tosses the flare gun lowers his hand to Schofield and
helps him up

Schofield stands unsteadily Blake studies his compass
getting his bearing

SCHOFIELD
Do you know where we are

BLAKE
Ecoust is directly south east If
we keep that bearing we should
make it

He looks in the direction Blake is facing - the land rolls
gently down a trampled road leads out of the quarry a
shattered copse of trees juts out of the earth Charred and
black

Schofield nods Blake stows the compass Raises his rifle

BLAKE (CONTD)
Come on then

They begin to walk

Blankets ammunition guns bayonets shells All have been
abandoned in this place They pass the remains of artillery -
the gun barrels have been blown out

BLAKE (CONTD)
Look at that They destroyed their
own guns

SCHOFIELD
They destroyed their own trenches
too

BLAKE

What do you mean
SCHOFIELD
I think they wanted us to go that
way They wanted to bury us
They walk

A noise startles them both They turn to the source ready to
fire -

A large rat scuttles over A DEAD GERMAN Blake kicks a rock
at it It scatters

BLAKE
Bastard rats

Blake looks across at Schofield He is still shaking
slightly

They walk watchful Eventually
BLAKE (CONTD)
Hey - did you hear that story about
Wilko How he lost his ear
SCHOFIELD
I’m not in the mood Keep your eyes
on the trees top of the ridge
Blake watches the top of the slope They walk

BLAKE
Bet he told you it was shrapnel

Beat

SCHOFIELD
What was it then

BLAKE
Well you know his girl’s a
hairdresser right And he was
moaning about the lack of bathing
facilities when he wrote to her -
remember those rancid jakes at
Arras

Schofield nods - they were disgusting

BLAKE (CONTD)
Anyway she sends him over this
‘hair oil’ Smells sweet like
Golden Syrup Wilko loves the
smell but he doesn’t want to cart
it around in his pack so-

They continue into the-

EXT SHATTERED COPSE - CONTINUOUS

They tread carefully over the battered earth It’s littered
with casings and flecks of metal

BLAKE
He slathers it all over his barnet
goes to sleep and in the middle of
the night he wakes up and a rat is
sitting on his shoulder licking the
oil off of his head

Schofield begins to laugh despite himself

BLAKE (CONTD)
Wilko panics and he jumps up and
when he does - the rat bites clean
through his fucking ear and runs
off with it

They are both laughing quietly
BLAKE (CONTD)

Oh he made a hell of a fuss
yelling screaming

The ground sweeps gently downward out of the burnt copse
Living things return to the world in small patches

BLAKE (CONTD)
Best of it was he put so much
bloody oil on himself that he
couldn’t wash it off He was like a
magnet Rats left us alone but
they couldn’t get enough of him
Poor bastard

They emerge from the copse scanning the surroundings They
appear to be alone

Above far in the distance the same two British planes seem
to hover in the sky arcing back towards British lines
Schofield looks up at them

SCHOFIELD
Heading back home
(beat)
I wonder what they saw

Schofield pulls his eyes away from the planes The two men
briefly scan the land around them

BLAKE
Watch the ridge lines

They move off again Blake’s eyes stick to the left
Schofield’s scan the right After a beat

SCHOFIELD
Well that’s your medal sorted then

BLAKE
What do you mean

They continue walking

SCHOFIELD
“Lance Corporal Blake showed
unusual valour in rescuing a
comrade from certain death” blah
blah blah

BLAKE
You reckon

SCHOFIELD
I do

Blake is pleased
BLAKE
Well that’d be nice Since you
lost yours

A beat

SCHOFIELD
I didn’t lose mine

Schofield keeps walking

BLAKE
What happened to it then

SCHOFIELD
Why do you care

BLAKE
Why do you not

Beat

SCHOFIELD

I swapped it with a French captain
BLAKE

Swapped it For what
SCHOFIELD

Bottle of wine
BLAKE

What did you do that for
SCHOFIELD

I was thirsty
BLAKE

What a waste

(beat)
You should have taken it home with
you you should have given it to
your family
Schofield doesn’t respond

BLAKE (CONTD)
Men have died for that

No response

BLAKE (CONTD)
If I got a medal I’d take it back
home why didn’t you just take it
home-

SCHOFIELD
Look it’s just a bit of bloody tin
It doesn’t make you special it
doesn’t make any difference to
anyone

BLAKE
Yes it does

Beat

BLAKE (CONTD)
And it’s not just a bit of tin
(then)
It’s got a ribbon on it

Schofield laughs exasperated
Then he turns to Blake looks at him
SCHOFIELD
I hated going home I hated it
When I knew I couldn’t stay When I
knew I had to leave them and they

might never see me-

He chokes up Fights with himself for a moment Then he turns
and walks ahead

Blake watches him feeling guilty Then he follows
Up ahead Schofield is approaching the remains of a walled
orchard He stops at the gate
EXT WALLED ORCHARD - CONTINUOUS
The near wall has partially collapsed in a mound of rubble
Beyond it cherry trees litter the ground All have been cut
down felled in the wanton destruction of the German retreat
Pale blossoms swim all around ruffled by the wind
Schofield looks at it all

SCHOFIELD

(to himself)
Jesus They chopped them all down

Blake has followed him a little guiltily Wanting to
apologise but unsure how He takes in the orchard

BLAKE
Cherries

Blake looks at one of the trees He reaches down picks a
blossom holds it up

BLAKE (CONTD)
Lamberts

They begin to walk through the felled trees

BLAKE (CONTD)
They might be Dukes hard to tell
when they aren’t in fruit

SCHOFIELD
What’s the difference

Blake is a little wry sensing Schofield softening

BLAKE
Well people think there’s one type
but there’s lots of them -
Cuthberts Queen Annes
Montmorencys Sweet ones sour
ones

SCHOFIELD
Why on earth would you know this

BLAKE
Mum’s got an orchard back home
Only a few trees This time of year
it looks like it’s been snowing
blossom everywhere And then in
May we have to pick them Me and
Joe Takes the whole day

A pang of homesickness creeps into Blake as he and Schofield
clamber over a downed tree They are now alongside each
other

Schofield registers this

SCHOFIELD
So these ones all gonners

BLAKE
Oh no they’11 grow again when the
stones rot You’1l end up with more
trees than before

A large wall borders the lower end of the orchard still
intact Schofield arrives at the gate

Ahead of them visible through the gate is a small valley In
the valley lie the remains of a French farmhouse abandoned
It is utterly derelict now - the roof is just a skeleton of
beams Next to it is a clapboard barn ragged with shell
holes

Schofield and Blake peer through the gate at the small
collection of buildings below Everything is still

Schofield looks anxiously at the farmhouse

BLAKE (CONTD)
It looks abandoned

SCHOFIELD
Let’s hope so

BLAKE
We have to make sure

Schofield leads the way he moves through the gate
cautiously rifle raised Blake follows

They slip down the hill They are in an old pigsty
surrounded by a broken fence which runs down to the murky
water of a pond

Carefully as he walks Schofield scans the buildings ahead

The wind rustles the long grass An ominous atmosphere
pervades this place

They approach the farmhouse
SCHOFIELD
(sotto)
Ill take front you take back

They split Blake disappears round the back Schofield moves
towards the front door

A DEAD DOG lies by the path

Schofield looks at it for a beat His hands tighten on his
rifle as he braces himself for what might be inside

Schofield quickly walks up the small front path through the
open door
INT FRENCH FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He is still for a moment on the threshold breath held
listening for any sounds of life in the house

The silence burns

Schofield enters The only sounds now are the floor boards
creaking under his boots

This place has been trashed by the soldiers who were here

Schofield turns right into -

INT FRENCH FARMHOUSE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Schofield moves through the bedroom Empty He moves back
into-

INT FRENCH FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Schofield crosses the hallway He spots Blake through the
window

BLAKE
Anything

SCHOFIELD
Nothing

Schofield moves forward towards the kitchen Something
catches his eye

A child’s doll sits on the floor Cigarette burns on its
eyes

Schofield looks at it for a beat Then moves into the
kitchen

INT FRENCH FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Low dusty light streaks in from the smashed windows
Schofield takes in the room Blake enters through the back
door

BLAKE
Did you find any food
SCHOFIELD
No
(beat)
I don’t like this place

He moves out through the back door-

EXT REAR FRENCH FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Schofield moves across the barren yard to a dilapidated barn

INT BARN - CONTINUOUS
Remnants and debris are scattered around
The low sounds of a cow echo from the fields beyond

Schofield looks - a single COW stands in the field Two or
three other dead cows lie near it

Schofield turns scanning the barn floor He peers into a
milk urn it’s empty

Close by there is a bucket lid half on
He tips the lid off with his foot -
Milk
He kneels and smells it then lowers in a hand and lifts some
to his mouth It’s been months since he tasted anything as
good
Behind him Blake exits the farmhouse
BLAKE
Map says we get over that ridge and

it’s a straight shot to Ecoust

SCHOFIELD
Good

He takes out his empty canteen and pours milk into it fills
it to the brim

The huge door at back of the barn is open to the fields

The drone of plane engines through the doorway catches
Schofield’s attention

Schofield spots planes through the barn door He moves
towards them to get a better look Entranced

He moves outside to watch

EXT REAR FRENCH FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Schofield wanders out away from the barn He looks up into
the grey sky

Three planes - a dogfight Tiny at this distance insect-
like

Schofield’s eyes follow them keenly Two British fighters
against one German

The violence is so far removed from him that it looks
balletic Beautiful even He moves towards them to get a
better look

The planes twist and circle in the air engines droning and
whining as the planes dip and rise

BLAKE (0S)
Is that our friends again

SCHOFIELD
Looks like it Dogfight

BLAKE
Who’s winning

SCHOFIELD
Us I think Two on one

The two of them stand looking up at the majesty of it

Then in the distance the German plane begins to trail black
smoke

The hum of the German engine fails The two British planes

follow it hammering away on their guns until it is clear
that there is no hope for the German

BLAKE
They got him

The German plane coasts silently towards the earth

Blake and Schofield watch as it gets closer and closer
Hypnotised

From the bend of wings you can tell the PILOT is trying to
glide Trying and failing

The plane drops like a leaf catching updrafts only to
suddenly dip again - aiming for the fields some distance
ahead of them

The plane dips Wobbles Fighting to stay up It banks left
and drops below the horizon

Schofield walks forwards to have a better look Then
suddenly the plane reappears over the horizon flying very
low It is heading straight at them

Schofield realises they are in the path of the plane He
begins backing away retreating towards the house

The plane is much closer now behind them as they run They
can’t make it back to the house

Schofield and Blake throw themselves down on the ground
pressing themselves into the earth as the plane screams in
their direction smashing into the barn directly behind them

Black smoke pours from the plane and the shattered skeleton
of the barn

The fire is quick licking along the old wood

INT BARN - CONTINUOUS
Smoke billows from the plane Inside it someone is screaming

Blake moves first he runs into the barn Schofield tailing
him

Tongues of fire whip out from the engine the pilot is
inside Burning

Flames lick at his mangled legs and torso his gloved hands
cover his face

Blake grabs at the man the back of his hand touches the yoke
as he tries to free the pilot - he cries out as the metal
sears his skin
Schofield tears open the pilot’s strap and together they
wrench him free dragging him from the remains of the

cockpit and pulling his body through the smoke

The Pilot’s legs are on fire

PILOT PILOT
Meine beine Meine beine My legs My legs Help me
Hilf mir Hilf mir Help me

EXT REAR FRENCH FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Schofield and Blake drag the pilot by his shoulders - the
true extent of his injuries laid bare in the daylight

The flames have done bad damage His trousers have been
partially burnt off blood streaks down his legs

The Pilot’s blue eyes dart at them in agony He shivers
violently with shock his lips form words his voice is a
harsh whisper

(NB None of the German dialogue will be subtitled We
should understand only what Blake and Schofield understand)

PILOT PILOT
Lazarett Kamerad Bitte Military hospital comrade
Bitte Wasser Water Please Please Water Water

They look down at the Pilot shocked unsure of what to do
Schofield turns to Blake

SCHOFIELD
(sotto to Blake)
We should put him out of his
misery

Schofield and Blake share a look
BLAKE
No Get him some water He needs

water

Blake kneels beside the pilot gently cradles his head on his
knees The pilot struggles terrified and in pain

Schofield moves to the water pump his back to Blake and the
Pilot

BLAKE (0S) (CONTD)
It’s alright you’re alright Stay
still Stay still
PILOT PILOT
Bitte tdte mich nicht Ich Please help me I dont want
mdchte leben to die

Schofield works the pump the levers screeching as the
mechanism creaks back to life

Creak- creak-
Orange water cascades out slapping into the metal trough

Schofield keeps cranking the squeaking handle it almost
drowns out the voices behind him

Creak- creak-

Schofield collects the water in his helmet

Creak- creak-

Then suddenly - shouting

From behind him piercing through the other sounds

BLAKE
StopStop

Schofield turns starts forward

Blake screams in agony Schofield moves towards him
confusion on his face until he sees-

A bloody knife in the pilot’s hand pulled out of Blake’s
abdomen

SCHOFIELD
No no no

Schofield grabs his rifle-
He fires two shots into the pilot killing him outright

Blake is looking down at his own bloody hands

BLAKE
Bastard bloody bastard

Blake gets to his feet breathing heavy Clutching his
abdomen he staggers away from the pilot’s body

BLAKE (CONTD)
Oh God no Oh God no

Schofield watches him scared

Blake goes for his dressings he clumsily pulls them out of
his pocket they unspool in his shaking hands

Blood is seeping through Blake’s tunic He drops to his
knees He looks down at his own blood and sobs

BLAKE (CONTD)
Jesus Jesus no

Schofield moves forward grabs the dressing just as Blake
drops down to the ground

SCHOFIELD
We have to stop the bleeding

Schofield wads the dressing he moves Blake’s hand and pushes
the white bandage hard against Blake’s tunic trying to stem
the blood

Blake shouts in pain

BLAKE
Stop it Stop it

Schofield tries to calm him
SCHOFIELD
It’s alright it’s going to be
alright We’re going to stand up

Schofield wraps his hands around Blake’s webbing

BLAKE
Yes Yes

Blake sets his feet Schofield wrenches him up Blake screams
in agony

BLAKE (CONTD)
No I can’t I can’t

54

They drop back down

Blake is pale blood is pumping out of him his lips are
already grey

SCHOFIELD

We have to get to an Aid Post
BLAKE

I can’t
SCHOFIELD

I’ll carry you It isn’t very far

BLAKE
Just bring a doctor here

Schofield looks around for help there isn’t any They are
alone

SCHOFIELD
We can’t we have to go together-

Schofield looks at Blake desperation in his eyes
SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Were going to get up We’re going
to get up
Schofield moves behind Blake grabs him under his arms He
lifts Blake but Blake cannot support his own weight his
legs buckle

BLAKE
Stop please Stop

Schofield holds him up Begins to drag him

Schofield keeps trying to drag Blake The more Blake
struggles the more blood pisses out of his wound

Blake is suddenly wild he screams like an animal flailing
savagely clawing at Schofield’s chest and neck spitting
blood struggling against him
BLAKE (CONTD)
Put me down Put me down you
bastard please Put me down
They fall backwards

Schofield moves to face Blake

Blake’s whole face is colourless now

Schofield looks down His eyes land on Blake’s dressing It
is scarlet now sopping wet with blood He swaps it for a
fresh dressing Panic swarms him

SCHOFIELD
You have to try to keep moving

Blake is weakening

BLAKE
Let’s just sit let me sit

SCHOFIELD
We can’t We have to find the 2nd
Remember Your brother We have to
go now

Schofield stares down at Blake he’s not lucid anymore His
eyes are already glazing

BLAKE
You can start on without me I’1l1
catch up

SCHOFIELD
You can’t stay here We have to
move alright We have to move
A beat
SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Come on Come on That’s it Come
on come on
Schofield wraps one arm around Blake’s back the other round
his legs he gets to his feet and with all his might he
heaves Blake upward Blake howls in pain

Schofield screams with the effort giving it all he’s got
But Blake is a dead weight He can’t lift him

They drop Schofield looks at him desperate
SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Your brother We have to find your

brother

Blake’s breathing is coming in short bursts

BLAKE
You’1l recognise him Looks like
mea bit older

Schofield holds Blake’s head up He looks impotently around
for help

Behind them the barn is crumbling in on itself scarlet
embers drift across the sky carried on the breeze Blake
stares up at them confused

BLAKE (CONTD)
What are they Are we being

shelled

SCHOFIELD
They’re embers the barn is on
fire

Blake looks bewildered Then some pain creeps into his eyes
some awful knowledge

BLAKE
I’ve been hit What was it

Schofield looks down at him unsure how to answer

SCHOFIELD
You were stabbed

Blake looks surprised His hand feels dumbly for his wound
It lands on Schofield’s - he’s holding down the tunic
stemming what blood he can

There is blood on Blake’s lips His breathing is becoming
laboured

BLAKE
Am I dying

A beat

SCHOFIELD
Yes I think you are

An “Oh” forms on Blake’s lips Profound sadness follows the
shock

Blake reaches up slowly and taps his tunic pocket Schofield
guesses his meaning - goes to the pocket pulls out a wallet

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
This

BLAKE
Inside

Schofield opens the cover inside are a bunch of letters and
a photograph - Blake his mother and his brother Joe
Schofield holds it up for Blake to see yes thats what I
want

Schofield puts the photograph in Blake’s hand he presses it
to his breast

BLAKE (CONTD)
Will you write to my mum for me

SCHOFIELD
I will

BLAKE
Tell her I wasn’t scared

Schofield nods

A long beat Schofield lets go of the pressure on Blake’s
wound He holds his hand

SCHOFIELD
Anything else

Blake is slipping away tears well and roll down his cheeks
BLAKE
I love themI wish that
I wish
It’s half strangled by sadness A long beat Schofield holds
him Death is close stiffening Blake’s body it’s already in

his eyes

BLAKE (CONTD)
Talk to me

Schofield looks at Blake he has no idea what to say

BLAKE (CONTD)
Tell me you know the way

SCHOFIELD

I know the way I’m going to head
south east until I hit Ecoust

Blake listens

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
I’1ll pass through the town and out
to the east all the way to
Croisilles Wood

BLAKE
(faint)
It’ll be dark by then

SCHOFIELD
That won’t bother me I’11 find
the 2nd I’1l give them the
message and then I’11 find your
brother Just like you a little
older

He stops Blake is no longer breathing

Without the lines of worry or agony on his face Blake looks
very young

Schofield is still for a moment cradling the head of Blake

A long beat Behind Schofield the barn is collapsing in on
itself

The smoke has risen several stories into the sky
Schofield looks at Blake Desperate

Then he snaps out of it With sudden determination he
rummages through the pockets of Blake’s tunic - takes the
message for the 2nd blood from his hands smudges on the
envelope

He stows it safely in his top pocket He pulls out the map
from Blake’s tunic It is saturated in blood Illegible
Schofield throws it away

He takes Blake’s rings from his lifeless hands then opens
his tunic and goes for Blake’s identity disc tearing it off
of the twine

He pries the photograph from Blake’s dead hand looks at it
then leaves it face down over his heart inside his tunic

Schofield looks around them beside the pond is a patch of
long grass

Schofield heaves Blake’s torso up - the endeavour entirely
different now Blake is dead

Nothing is heavier than the dead body of someone you loved

PRIVATE PARRY (0S)
You alright mate

Schofield looks up shocked to see TWO BRITISH PRIVATES -
PARRY and ATKINS

PRIVATE ATKINS
It’s alright it’s okay

PRIVATE PARRY
Come on help him

Parry and Atkins move forward and take Blake’s legs Together
the three of them move Blake to the long grass As they move
him

PRIVATE ATKINS
Jesus what happened to him

Schofield doesn’t answer

PRIVATE PARRY
Was it the plane We saw the smoke

Schofield nods
SCHOFIELD
(sotto)
Yes
They lower Blake down Schofield kneels by his head Lost

A gentle voice off camera

CAPTAIN SMITH (0S)
Go fetch his things

PRIVATE PARRY PRIVATE ATKINS
Sir Yes Sir

Parry and Atkins go to collect Schofield’s helmet and rifle
CAPTAIN SMITH
(quietly)

A friend

Schofield nods He kneels beside Blake’s body Impotent

A beat

CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)
What are you doing here

SCHOFIELD
I have an urgent message for the
2nd Devons Orders to stop tomorrow
morning’s attack

CAPTAIN SMITH
Where are they stationed

SCHOFIELD
Just beyond Ecoust

CAPTAIN SMITH
Come with me

Smith heads back towards the farmhouse Schofield doesn’t
move He can’t look away from Blake

Smith stops turns back
CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)
Come with me Corporal That’s an
order
Schofield looks up at him
CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)
Were passing through Ecoust We

can take you some of the way

SCHOFIELD
Sir

Using the grass he wipes Blake’s blood from off his hands
He stands drags his eyes away from Blake’s body and then
moves after Smith

He collects his rifle and helmet from Parry then follows
Smith through the farmhouse and back out into-

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

A small convoy of four trucks idle on the road all caked in

mud and battered from their journey Soldiers mill smoking
pissing stretching their legs

At the head of the small convoy is an Officer’s car Exhaust
fumes swirl in the still air

COLONEL COLLINS (0S)
Oh come on Sergeant Put more men
at the base At the trunk It’1l be
heavier there

The trucks are filled to the brim with SOLDIERS - a mixture
of seasoned fighters and fresh recruits All are covered in
the mud of No Man’s Land

CAPTAIN SMITH
Might be a tight squeeze

They move towards the Officer’s car Mud hardens on the
undercarriage and the wheel arches

COLONEL COLLINS
No You’re not going to be able to
just lift it Pivot the front end
to the left-

At the front of the convoy a large tree trunk blocks the
road like the cherry blossoms felled on purpose trunk
neatly chopped Several PRIVATES and an NCO are gathered
around trying to lift it

A Colonel COLLINS (corpulent sweating) barks orders from
the front seat of the car

Smith and Schofield approach the car

COLONEL COLLINS (CONTD)
(to the driver)
Jesus They don’t make things easy
do they They could at least have
retreated with a bit of grace
Bastards

CAPTAIN SMITH
Sir-

Collins turns and looks down on Smith and Schofield his face
registering confusion

COLONEL COLLINS
(registering Schofield)
You’re not one of mine

SCHOFIELD
No Sir

Collins looks at Smith for explanation

CAPTAIN SMITH
He’s got an urgent message to
deliver to the 2nd Devons Sir

Collins’ attention is drawn back to the tree the men have
managed to shift it a few feet to the left

COLONEL COLLINS
(To the driver)
Can you get past it

SERGEANT HARROP (0S)
No Sir

COLONEL COLLINS
Oh for God’s sake
(Loudly to the men)
Just move it

CAPTAIN SMITH
There’s room in the casuals truck
sir He has orders-—

COLONEL COLLINS
Yes yes alright
(to Harrop)
Come on now You can get through
there sideways

The car begins to roll forward

Smith moves off as the Colonel’s car begins to manoeuvre its
way around the felled tree

Smith and Schofield walk past the row of trucks all packed
with soldiers Schofield takes it in

SCHOFIELD
How did you get here Sir

CAPTAIN SMITH
Crossed No Man’s Land just outside
Bapaume Took us the whole night
Bumped into a couple of Hun
stragglers on the way who made a
nuisance of themselves

SCHOFIELD
You going up to the new line

CAPTAIN SMITH
Attempting to The Newfoundlands
have pushed forwards and requested
reinforcements

They approach the last truck Smith looks at him

CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)
I’m sorry about your friend

Schofield nods

CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)
May I tell you something that you
probably already know

They stop Schofield looks to him

CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)
It doesn’t do to dwell on it

SCHOFIELD
No Sir

They have reached the rear of the fourth and final truck TWO
or THREE PRIVATES mill by the rear step smoking They stand
to attention when the see the Captain

CAPTAIN SMITH
(to Schofield)
Hop on

Smith speaks to the soldiers
CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)
Make some space there Come on

in you get

A bit of grumbling as the soldiers try to make space for him
A couple of the men help him up and into-

INT ARMY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Twenty men an amalgamation of companies - some SCOTS some
SIKHS are crammed in here Schofield makes space for himself
on the fringe The men don’t look at Schofield don’t much

care about the hitch-hiker

They are quiet for a beat until Smith’s footsteps die away
and the sound of the engine rumbles

Schofield sits silently

PRIVATE COOKE
Alright Here we go again boys

PRIVATE ROSSI
Welcome aboard the night bus to
fuck-knows-where

PRIVATE COOKE
Is that a dead dog

No one answers him

Schofield looks out of the back watching the road and the
farmhouse disappear behind him

PRIVATE BUTLER
(To Rossi)
You got a fag

Rossi hands one over

PRIVATE ROSSI
Yeah there you go

They light their cigarettes

PRIVATE COOKE
(sotto)
Butler Oy Carry on with that
story

PRIVATE BUTLER

(sotto)
Oh yeah Right So When we get off
the train Beaufoy comes up to us
and he’s having a right go -

(He attempts a posh

accent complete with

lisp)
“Lance Corporal Whatever one does
one never lets standards slip”
Then Scott comes out of the
latrine he wipes his hand on the
back of Beaufoy’s jacket Shit all
down his back

Laughter

PRIVATE COOKE
Was that meant to be Captain
Beaufoy

PRIVATE BUTLER
Oh piss off you You can’t do any
better

Schofield pulls his bloody tunic tight around himself
watches He almost disappears into the noise of the men

PRIVATE COOKE
(Impersonating the lisp)
“MEN Your rifle stocks are an
embarrassment to the entire
expeditionary force”

SEPOY JONDALAR
You’re both bloody awful

PRIVATE COOKE
You don’t know you barely even
speak the bloody language

PRIVATE MALKY
He’s got a better grasp of it than
you Cooke

PRIVATE COOKE
Go on then Jondalar give it a go
let’s see it

The men are getting rowdier We watch Schofield as they grate
on his quiet grief

PRIVATE ROSSI
Let’s hear it then Jonny

The men noisily encourage him

SEPOY JONDALAR
(Much the best
impersonation - perfect
lisp gestures)
“Rossi Never in my two hundred
years as a soldier have I seen such
a sorry excuse for a latrine pit-”

The men are all laughing enjoying it

PRIVATE COOKE
Shite That is total shit

Cooke gets shouted down by the men Someone chucks a canteen
at Cooke misses

PRIVATE COOKE (CONTD)
Oy You could have taken my teeth
out with that

PRIVATE ROSSI
You could do with a new set

Schofield is still The laughter settles
After a beat Schofield checks his wristwatch BUTLER sees it

PRIVATE BUTLER
You got somewhere you need to be

The men all look at him
Suddenly the truck lurches violently Schofield bumps into a
man near him The engine groans under them The sounds of

tyres spinning

PRIVATE ROSSI
Oh no

A spatter of mud is thrown up The engine revs but the truck
sinks deeper

Schofield stands leans out of the canvas

PRIVATE COOKE
Arsehole needs driving lessons

A few men groan in agreement

Schofield jumps out into-

EXT ROADSIDE DITCH - CONTINUOUS

Schofield looks at the stuck wheel The truck has driven off
the road trying to get round another fallen tree Its rear
wheel is sinking into a muddy ditch

Ahead the convoy is stopped waiting on them

Schofield speaks to one of the Privates Cooke as he stares
at the wheel

SCHOFIELD
He should reverse

PRIVATE COOKE
Yeah

Cooke does nothing Schofield moves to the Driver’s side of
the truck

SCHOFIELD
(Loudly to the driver)
Try it in reverse REVERSE

A crunch of gears as the driver puts it in reverse The
engine revs again Schofield bends down to look The wheel is
still spinning The truck is slipping deeper

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
No Stop STOP

After a beat the sound of revving dies out and the engine
idles

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Everyone needs to get out

Some of the men climb to their feet and drop out Others
don’t move

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
All out

The men aren’t moving fast enough

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Come on

PRIVATE BUTLER
Alright alright Keep your bloody
hair on

Begrudgingly a few fall in behind and beside the truck and
ready themselves

SCHOFIELD
Right One Two Three

The tyre spins on the spot mud flies up Schofield and the
men push Heaving together-

The truck isn’t moving

But Schofield wont stop he pushes and pushes groaning
under the effort Desperation etched all over his face

PRIVATE COOKE
We need to get some wood put it
under the wheels
The other men drop back away from the truck frame

Schofield doesn’t

SCHOFIELD
No We haven’t got the time

He puts everything he has into shifting the truck

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
We all need to push

His whole body shakes with the effort

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Come on COME ON

He begins to yell Pushing screaming in desperation

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
COME OOOON

The men look at him

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Please I have to go now Please

The men see Schofield’s desperation Recognise it
They fall back in beside him

PRIVATE BUTLER
Alight come on lads Come on

Together the twenty of them push all at once all stretched
to the very limits of their strength

PRIVATE ROSSI
Come on boys

SCHOFIELD
One Two Three

Schofield screams in desperation

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
AAAAAAAHHHHH

PRIVATE ROSSI
Come on boys One last push Yes

One Two Three

Suddenly the truck moves the wheel catches some grass and
WHOMPH-

It lurches forwards out of the ditch Schofield falls
forward into the mud

He struggles to his knees trying to get his emotions back
under control struggling not to cry

Jondalar lifts him to his feet

SCHOFIELD
Back in Get back in Go

The other men are looking at him they see his emotion They
start to load back in

Jondalar puts his hand on Schofield’s arm A fleeting moment
of solace

SEPOY JONDALAR
Are you alright

Schofield nods

TWO SOLDIERS stand on the rear step helping to pull the
others up and in As they do-

PRIVATE COOKE(0OS)
Here Driver how about you try to
keep it on the bloody road for a
change

DRIVER (0S)
Oh piss off

The men are almost all loaded in Schofield brings up the
rear
INT ARMY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Schofield takes the arm of the soldier helping men up and is
pulled inside

The convoy moves off Rattling over the land

Around Schofield the men are quiet their eyes on him

After a while-

SEPOY JONDALAR
So where are you going

SCHOFIELD
I have to get to the 2nd Devons
Just past Ecoust

SEPOY JONDALAR
Why

SCHOFIELD
Theyre attacking at dawn I have
orders to stop them

PRIVATE MALKY
How come

SCHOFIELD
They’re walking into a trap

PRIVATE COOKE
How many

SCHOFIELD
Sixteen hundred

This stops them all

PRIVATE COOKE
Jesus

PRIVATE BUTLER
Why did they send you on your own

SCHOFIELD
They didn’t There were two of us

A beat The men understand what this means

PRIVATE ROSSI
So now it’s down to you

SCHOFIELD
Yes

PRIVATE COOKE
You’11 never make it

Beat Schofield turns to Cooke Looks at him

SCHOFIELD
Yes I will

Butler offers Schofield some of his whisky He takes a drink

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Thank you

Now all the men are looking out the back watching the
distance drop away

The truck is sweeping past a small hamlet or at least the
remains of one houses have been reduced to skeletons the
destruction is fresh embers still smoulder Anything of

value built on this land has been systematically destroyed

Dead cattle lie in the fields

PRIVATE ROSSI
Look at it Fucking look at it
Three years fighting over this We
should have just let the bastards
keep it I mean who machine guns
cows

PRIVATE MALKY
Huns with extra bullets

PRIVATE ROSSI
Bastards

While they talk Schofield checks that the letter is still in
his pocket

He carefully puts it in his tobacco tin
SEPOY JONDALAR
Clever They know if they don’t
shoot the cow you will eat it

Rossi nods fair point

PRIVATE ROSSI
Still bastards

PRIVATE MALKY
Yeah it’s not even our bloody
country

Brakes creak as the truck slows a little Schofield reacts

PRIVATE BUTLER
How long gone d’you reckon they
are

SEPOY JONDALAR
Why Worried we’ll catch up with
them

PRIVATE BUTLER
Yeah right Be a bloody miracle at
this rate

PRIVATE COOKE
They are probably right around the
next corner

PRIVATE ROSSI
Piss off no they’re not

PRIVATE COOKE
Why don’t they just bloody well
give up Eh Don’t they want to go
home

PRIVATE ROSSI
They hate their wives and
mothers and Germany must be a
shit hole

PRIVATE COOKE
They’re retreating they’re miles
back We’ve got them on the ropes
at least

SEPOY JONDALAR
No We don’t

The truck slows down It is juddering as if navigating
cobbles

Schofield’s eyes dart to the back worried

Suddenly the truck grinds to a halt A few ready themselves
to jump out

PRIVATE BUTLER
Oh bollocks What’s up now

PRIVATE COOKE
Not another bloody tree

The driver calls through the canvas

DRIVER (0S)
Bridge is down

PRIVATE COOKE
(sarcastic - sotto)
Oh That’s a shame
Schofield looks out the back of the truck
SCHOFIELD
Looks like I’1ll be getting out
here Good luck
PRIVATE ROSSI
Keep some of that luck for yourself
pal Think you’ll be needing it

PRIVATE BUTLER
Good luck mate

PRIVATE MALKY
Good luck

Drops out onto-

EXT CANAL SIDE - CONTINUOUS
Schofield jumps down into a new landscape

The land is sliced through by a huge straight industrial
canal The sun is now below the horizon

The men from the truck watch him go

PRIVATE COOKE PRIVATE SINGER
Good luck guv Good luck

PRIVATE COOKE (CONTD)
Don’t balls it up

SEPOY JONDALAR
I hope you get there

SCHOFIELD
Thank you

Captain Smith approaches
CAPTAIN SMITH

SCHOFIELD

Smith offers

Schofield his hand He takes it

CAPTAIN SMITH (CONTD)

Best of luck

SCHOFIELD

Thank you Sir

Smith goes to leave stops

CAPTAIN SMITH

Corporal If you do manage to get

there are witnesses

Beat

SCHOFIELD

They are direct orders Sir

I

CAPTAIN SMITH

fight

SCHOFIELD

Thank you Sir

Captain Smith calls out to the driver at the head of the

convoy

CAPTAIN SMITH

Driver Move off

Schofield wa
swirl in its

He turns his
bridge shat

tches as the small convoy drives away Fumes
wake

attention to the new obstacle - the remains of a
tered and half blown - now little more than

twisted metal dropping into the water

The town of Ecoust is a jagged silhouette visible about two
hundred yards the other side of the canal Smoke drifts The
town is still on fire

The canal is large and industrial - about 90 feet wide stone
sides once deep wood and detritus float on the surface of
the water

On the opposite bank are the remains of a lock house Two
storeys Windows blown in roof half collapsed Beyond that
the remains of some small buildings all abandoned and then
the jagged remains of Ecoust

Schofield surveys it Looks around All seems quiet Eerie
Schofield looks around for a way across The blown bridge is
his best bet Both sides of the metal bridge have collapsed
and slant down into the dark water

Schofield starts along the broken bridge then climbs up onto
the slim metal balustrade and starts inching downwards
towards the waterline It takes all his effort not to lose
his balance and fall into the water below

Finally he reaches the base of the slope and looks across at
the remaining half of the bridge About eight feet of water
between him and the other side

He prepares himself to jump across and-

CRACK-

A gunshot slaps the water just in front of him Birds fly up

Instinctively he leaps-

He lands heavily on the other side of the bridge His foot
slips into the water and he hauls himself up with his hands

He clings to the metal latticework scrambling forward

CRACK- another shot rings out hitting the water behind
CRACK- a bullet hits the metal near his hand He quickly
climbs across the torn carcass of the bridge towards the far
bank

Another bullet rings out as he drops down throwing himself
into-

EXT CANAL - CONTINUOUS

The cover of the far bank wall He rips in breaths as he
presses his body into the stone bank He stays low inching

along the side until he can get a sense of where the shots
are coming from

He looks Now he can register the direction of the shots A
SHOOTER in the lock house On the upper floor A single high
window

Schofield slides along the bank until he hits a small
stairwell set into the wall of the canal bank Barely enough
cover but his only option

CRACK Another bullet sings against the stone as he darts to
the other side of the stairs

Schofield readies his rifle his hands are ice and injured
and slow to work They shake violently as he tries to check
and load the weapon

Panting he tries to still his trembling body as he creeps up
to the top of the stairs he peers over the top step to line
up his shot

CRACK- a bullet sings off the stone next to his head

He sucks in a deep breath and holds it He exhales as he
leans into the shadow of the wall and readies his rifle

Schofield lifts his body above the wall and fires once
CRACK

Quickly the shooter fires back

Schofield aims again CRACK

The shooting stops

Silence

Schofield is still for a moment Breathing heavy Shaking
from the cold and from adrenalin

He spins and fires another two shots through the window of
the lock house

CRACK CRACK Wood splinters He waits
Again silence
He steadies himself and stands carefully rifle ready and

quickly advances to the lock house He pushes open the doors
and moves inside

INT LOCK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
No movement on the ground floor

The staircase is ahead of him His ears burn listening for
any sounds any hint of movement

He holds his breath the wood creaks under him as he backs
against the wall rifle pointing to the top of the staircase

Staying low and against the wall he moves upwards Parts of
the upstairs come into view -

He can now see the door to the upper room

Slowly he moves along the short corridor With his foot
Schofield pushes at the door It swings open agonisingly
slowly creaking on its hinges

Revealing-—

A GERMAN SOLDIER slumped against the far wall wounded - but
with his gun raised

A split second to react Schofield raises his rifle and
BOOM-BOOM

Both guns go off at the same time

The German’s bullet hits Schofield on the helmet ripping his
neck and upper body backwards almost lifting him off his
feet

Schofield stumbles backwards and falls-

Down the stairs

BAM - he hits the stone at the foot of the stairs and

Black

INT LOCK HOUSE - NIGHT
Still black
In the darkness the sound of a single drip

Out of the darkness Schofield’s face

The drip comes from a hole in the ceiling and falls on
Schofield’s forehead He opens his eyes

Schofield starts to move gingerly He lifts his hand with
difficulty runs it along the back of his head Looks at it -
slick with black blood

He sits up begins to focus His face and hair are wet His
legs are sprawled on the stairs above him He looks around
dumbly Unsure of what is up and what is down

He looks at his watch - smashed in the fall No idea what
time it is

Panic begins to claw at him He has somewhere to be If only
he could remember it

He looks around for his rifle He spots it above him at the
top of the stairs He crawls towards it

Reaches it

Suddenly the room fills with light Outside a flare streaks
across the sky As the light swings across the room
Schofield now sees the German soldier lying dead slumped
against the wall

Schofield stands and gradually descends the staircase

EXT ECOUST CANAL SIDE - CONTINUOUS
Darkness

Then another flare hisses across the black sky light bursts
from it

It falls slowly to earth the magnesium light blinding

As the light falls the whole world undulates before him Not
clear to him if he is awake or dreaming

The falling flare is playing with reality shapes and shadows
warp across the land

There has been a rainstorm The outlines of destroyed
buildings contract and expands ahead of him

He begins to stagger forwards through Ecoust Struggling to
pick his way through shifting spots of darkness unable to
tell what is shadow and what is a ditch The puddles reflect
the Verey light glowing as it falls stinging his eyes

CRACK - A gunshot Somewhere in the darkness there is another
sniper

A brief moment of confusion as he looks around for the
source of the gunshot

CRACK Another gunshot Distant shouts Schofield begins to
run

He runs at full pelt As he does the flare light dies Now
he is careening through shapeless darkness

We are running blind with Schofield The sound of his
footfalls his breathing

He crashes through a puddle the noise draws shots The
bullets buzz around him in the darkness Then -

HISS - another flare bursts above him

He flings himself down in the rubble

Shots clip the ground around him Schofield lies motionless
breathing heavily trying to disappear into the rubble around

him waiting for the light to die

He looks up trying to memorize his next path as the light
moves the ground ahead of him The light dies

Schofield is up and clattering in darkness across cobbles

Another flare goes up into the night sky but this time
Schofield doesn’t stop He keeps running

It sweeps directly over him he darts into the bombed out
remains of a shop As the light from the flare dies above
him he turns the corner into -

EXT ALLEY WAY ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

Narrow dark

He starts to move along the alley Feeling safe in the
blackness heading towards the flickering light at the end of
the alley -

EXT MAIN STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

Schofield looks both ways A broad main market street
stretches away in both directions

All windows are smashed buildings have been shelled and
collapsed in on themselves Some have vanished altogether

Schofield cautiously peers out along the wide street To his
left at the far end of the street is a Main Square framed
by a colonnade

Beyond just out of sight something large is burning

Schofield checks both ways then begins to walk down the
ruins of the empty street towards the square Wary

Large medieval colonnades flank the entrance to the square
some have crumbled Schofield slips through them and into -
EXT ECOUST MAIN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

Schofield stops under the columns The destruction here is
staggering -

Colonnades run around most of the square massive sections of
it are pitted with gaps Whole buildings are gone like
missing teeth - blackness yawns in them Entire storeys have
fallen away revealing empty rooms

At the centre of the square the remains of a fountain

In the far corner of the square the Church is on fire The
firelight reflects off the wet cobblestones and puddles
Schofield stares at it Awed

Then he spots something-

In front of the bright flames A MAN’S SILHOUETTE

Schofield sees him The Man stops lowers his weapon Starts
to walk towards him

Schofield cannot make out if he is a German or British
soldier and begins to move towards him

Suddenly the Man lifts his gun and starts to run heading
straight towards Schofield It’s A GERMAN SOLDIER

Schofield responds quickly He takes off running heading
through the colonnade The Soldier raises hie rifles and
fires after him

Schofield doesn’t stop heading out of the square and into -

EXT SIDE STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

He can hear the shouts of the Soldier coming after him
Schofield runs full tilt He turns a corner Ahead to his
left at about knee height is a low cellar window

He heads towards it grabs at it It’s locked
He can hear the footsteps of the soldier getting closer

Beside the window is a coal chute In a flash Schofield is
on his hands and knees through the dark opening scrambling
into -

INT COAL CELLAR - CONTINUOUS
Pitch black while his eyes adjust

He clutches his rifle steps back into the shadows His
breath saws in and out he listens to the slap of running
footsteps getting closer

Schofield slides down into the darkness as a pair of German
boots run by the low window

He stays crouched in the darkness for a time listening to
the footsteps receding His eyes finally leave the window and
look around him

He is in a low-ceilinged coal cellar Sections of the roof
above have collapsed letting in drips of rain and some faint
light The room is empty Then something catches his eye

At the far end of the room a small doorway Heavy fabric has
been hung across it His eyes catch the flicker of flame
escaping through material

Schofield readies his rifle He points it at the curtain
ready to fire gun cocked-

Carefully he advances into the small room Pushes the fabric
aside with his rifle

In the centre of the room a furnace presumably used to heat
the house A small makeshift fire has been lit in it Around
the fire a couple of blankets some firewood empty cans
crusts of stale bread

As Schofield’s eyes adjust to the light he sees movement in
the shadows Instinctively he lifts his rifle

There is a woman crouched in the corner LAURI late teens
frail and hollow-eyed

Her eyes fill with fear when she sees Schofield enter her
hiding place She doesn’t move to flee - there is nowhere to
go

LAURI LAURI
(subtitles pleading) (subtitles)
Il ny rien ici Nous navons There is nothing here We
rien pour vous Sil vous have nothing for you Please

Schofield sets his rifle down holds his hands up as if to
say I am not a threat

SCHOFIELD

She calms a little He looks around
SCHOFIELD (CONTD)

Schofield looks relieved

He suddenly begins to feel the pain in his head He sways a
little

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)

Assiez-toi Sit down

She motions for Schofield to sit pointing at a chair near
the fire He sways but doesn’t move

LAURI (CONTD) LAURI (CONTD)
Asseyez vous Monsieur Sit down Sir

He understands enough to obey her Swaying slightly he drops
into the chair

Still holding his hand to his head he closes his eyes and
feels the warmth of the fire on his face It makes him almost
delirious

Lauri watches him She slowly moves over to Schofield and
places her hand on his He jumps at her touch Tenderness
foreign to him

LAURI (CONTD)
Shhh Shhh

Her kindness translates

She inspects the wound She carefully parts his damp hair
finds the jagged wound He flinches

She is very close to him he can feel her breath on his neck
She reaches down takes out a handkerchief holds it against
the wound

He closes his eyes relaxes against her touch

Lauri looks at Schofield his eyes closed his uniform caked
in blood and mud

At last he turns back to face her They lock eyes A beat

SCHOFIELD
(quietly)
Thank you

Then from behind her comes a sound Something soft small A
BABY stirring Schofield starts

Lauri moves to the corner of the room An old mattress lies
on the floor Next to it a drawer from an old chest has been
lined with cloth She reaches in lifts the child cradles it
protectively

LAURI LAURI
(subtitles) (subtitles)
Ma petite My little one

Schofield stares at the baby as it settles in her arms It
can’t be more than five months old

SCHOFIELD
A girl

She nods her head

LAURI

(subtitles)
Qui Une fille

Schofield smiles A long beat

LAURI

The baby is waking she begins to cry Lauri soothes her
Schofield kneels down bedside them

The baby is soothed she settles

SCHOFIELD

What is her name

Lauri looks to Schofield desolate

LAURI

(subtitles)
Jne sais pas

SCHOFIELD

Who is her mother

LAURI

(subtitles)
Jne sais pas

The sadness nearly drowns them both A long beat

Schofield opens his pack and rummages -

SCHOFIELD

You can have them - here take them
all for you and the child Here

LAURI
(subtitles)

LAURI

Shakes her head

He empties his rations onto the mattress a bounty in this
barren place Lauri looks at them aching with hopelessness
Schofield doesn’t understand

LAURI LAURI
(subtitles) (subtitles)
Elle ne peut pas manger ga She can not eat that She

Schofield blinks

Milk

the word in English-
at her in disbelief

SCHOFIELD

Lauri nods
Schofield’s cold fingers pry the canteen from his belt He
opens it and hands it to her She looks at him in wonder She

smells the canteen Milk

Lauri looks up at him amazement and gratitude etched onto
her tired features

LAURI
Merci

The baby is fussing
Schofield moves closer gently talking to the child

SCHOFIELD
Bonjour

The baby’s bright eyes latch on to his

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Bonjour

The baby looks at him Begins to settle

LAURI LAURI
(subtitles) (subtitles)

He doesn’t answer He watches the baby

SCHOFIELD
Shhhh It’s alright
LAURI LAURI
(subtitles) (subtitles)
Elle vous aime Continuez She likes you Continue
continuez a parler keep talking

Schofield looks at the child searching for something to say
He says the first thing that comes into his head

He speaks softly like he’s done it before

SCHOFIELD
“They went to sea in a Sieve they
did

(MORE )

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
In a Sieve they went to sea
In spite of all their friends could

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)

“Far and few far and few

Are the lands where the Jumblies

live

Their heads are green and their

hands are blue

And they went to sea in a Sieve”
A beat The baby has settled hypnotised by the sound
They are still for a moment in the firelight

Suddenly the distant church bell tolls The noise rolls
through the quiet cellar Schofield starts at the sound

He counts the clock strikes in his head as they happen
TWO THREE

He keeps looking down at the baby but his eyes are filling
with fear

FOURFIVE His heart is sinking
SIX He holds his breath
Silence

He stands Goes for his pack Lauri watches him confused

Schofield takes his rifle and moves to the doorway

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
I’m sorry

He leaves

INT HOUSE ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

He pushes through the doorway Damaged wooden stairs lead up
Schofield slips over the rubble over the remains of the
house

He peers along the empty street

EXT SIDE STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

Schofield stays in the shadows and begins to work his way
along the street in the direction Lauri pointed him

The town is silent He looks up at the sky to see if the sun
is rising No light

He reaches a crossroads - small alleyways branch off He
looks around Lost He turns to his right - a wide alleyway

He moves along it quickly quietly

BANG - ahead of him a door flies open warm light spills out
onto the street followed by a German soldier PRIVATE
MULLER 30s blind drunk

Muller stumbles a few steps and then vomits Moaning and
muttering to himself

Schofield ducks into the darkness of a doorway

Muller moans and pukes again Schofield backs inside the
doorway and into-

INT SCHOOL HOUSE ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

A small school assembly hall and a couple of other rooms have
been blown together into one large space Metal beams where
there once was a roof A few school desks tipped onto their
sides

To one side of the room wide arched windows let in shafts of
light from the burning church outside They streak across the
inky darkness

At the far end of the room is the door Private Muller just

exited A small fire burns on the floor by it Smoke hangs in
the room A couple of empty bottles lie around

Schofield stays in the shadows Silently scanning the
darkness listening to the pathetic moans of Muller outside

He looks around searching for another way out a way past
Muller

Out of the shadows steps a man - ANOTHER GERMAN SOLDIER -
BAUMER late teens He is doing up his flies

They lock eyes three feet apart

A beat - shock on both their faces then horror Neither of
them want this

Baumer opens his mouth to scream

Schofield closes the three feet and is on him - pushing
Baumer hard against a pillar

Schofield holds Baumer there his hand clamped over the young
soldiers mouth They lock eyes Schofield holds his finger to
his lips Stay quiet

Baumer nods

Schofield slowly drops his hand from Baumer’s mouth Wary

Baumer sucks in a breath and shouts out

BAUMER BAUMER
Englander English

Schofield reacts quickly ramming his palm into Baumer’s
mouth gagging him as they both fall onto the hard ground -
the sound echoes loudly though the school house

Baumer bites down on Schofield’s hand still bound with its
bandage

Schofield gasps out gritting his teeth against the pain He
forces his hand further into Baumer’s mouth his other hand
goes to the boys throat - squeezing with all his strength

Baumer has a knife Schofield wrestles it out of his hand

Baumer thrashes and kicks under Schofield rolling the two of
them to the side

They are two feral creatures - both know this is to the
death

A shadow at the far end of the room Muller is coming back

PRIVATE MULLER PRIVATE MULLER
Mein Gott Baumer Das war Christ Baumer This was a
ein Fehler Wir sollten heute mistake We should go back
Abend zurtick gehen tonight maybe no one will
Vielleicht hat niemand notice weve gone

gemerkt dass wir weg waren

Muller staggers his way over to a spot by the fire slumps
down Rummages among the empty bottles

Baumer tears a breath in through his nostrils tries to
scream -

Schofield squeezes harder on the boy’s neck pushing the
boys head down into the ground Crushing him into the broken
glass and debris

PRIVATE MULLER (CONTD) PRIVATE MULLER (CONTD)
Wo ist der Brandy Du kleiner Wheres the brandy You
Scheisser wehe du bist little shit you better not

Desperately Baumer beats his hands against Schofield’s
chest Muller hears the noise

Muller turns and peers towards them He can’t see them in the
shadows

PRIVATE MULLER (CONTD) PRIVATE MULLER (CONTD)
Baumer Wo ist Baumer Baumer Where is Baumer

But Schofield can see him and his focus briefly shifts
In that moment Baumer fights back - Kicking clawing
punching But he is weaker now Schofield redoubles his

efforts His hands and arms ache Acid stings in his muscles

Schofield is desperate His eyes flick between Muller and
Baumer

Baumer’s feet scratch and scrape frantically on the stone

PRIVATE MULLER (CONTD) PRIVATE MULLER (CONTD)
Baumer Baumer

Muller stands teeters towards them
Then - Baumer’s arms fall limp

Schofield snaps up leaving his rifle behind him and leaps
out of the shadows

He barges straight past Muller heading for the door at the
far end of the room Muller staggers back -

EXT SIDE STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

Schofield is out of the door running hands free breath
sawing in his ears The sound of Muller behind him-

PRIVATE MULLER (0S) PRIVATE MULLER (0S)
ENGLANDER ENGLANDER ENGLISH ENGLISH

Muller’s howl chases Schofield along the street The sound of
the door swinging open echoes after him

Schofield doesn’t stop Behind him is the sound of Muller
giving chase then-

CRACK-

A bullet sings off the wall opposite

EXT SMALL STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

Schofield sprints looking over his shoulder

He turns and fifty yards in front him -

Another German Soldier The same man who chased him across
the square The soldier breaks into a run reaches for his
rifle

The soldier shoots but Schofield breaks left across the
street and into -

EXT TINY STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

A narrow alley

Schofield darts down it looking for some escape

Muller and the other German race into the alley behind him
Shots burst on the wall next to Schofield

To his left is another corner Schofield sprints for it Flat
out into -

EXT CURVED STAIRS STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS

Ahead of Schofield is a flight of stone steps

He leaps down Taking them three or four at a time

He slams against the wall leaps down another flight

His breath burns in his lungs At the bottom of the stairs
is a long straight street about 100 yards Leading to a
Bridge

Schofield runs towards it

EXT BRIDGE STREET ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
His heartbeat thunders as he sprints flat out

The street slopes downhill Yards fall under him We can now
see the burning Town receding behind him

The sound of the Two Germans battering down the stairs echoes
after him

They hit the flat street 30 yards behind him

They open fire

Bullets crack off the cobbles just in front of him

He is 50 yards from the bridge running full tilt

Shots ring out

Schofield reaches the bridge Bullets ring off the rubble
He keeps sprinting

And suddenly with no warning Schofield veers across the
street puts one hand on the stone wall of the bridge

and vaults clean over it -

EXT RIVER ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
Schofield drops forty feet and smashes into the water

We are under the dark water

Schofield resurfaces gasping for air Numb panicking he
thrashes and kicks fighting the weight the cold the fear

He struggles to slip off his webbing It tangles up in his
arms pulling him down

Finally he gets it off it is swallowed up in the white water
which churns all around him

Losing the weight of the webbing he manages to stay above
the water

The bridge and the German soldiers are long gone The water
is fast flowing after the rain rapids sweep him along

A felled tree lies across the river Schofield grabs hold of
its branches tries to pull himself up But the torrent is
too strong to fight It rips his hands away and pulls him
under again

He surfaces Coughs and splutters on the water line

The rapids continue to pull him through the water at speed
Schofield goes with it Letting the water carry him

He scans the river banks ahead They tower up steeply He
looks for a way out Around him rocks jut out from the water
dangerously They churn the river into a whirlpool spinning
him around

He is now traveling backwards downstream

Behind him a large rock rises up out of the water He is
approaching it fast He doesn’t see it

The water drives him hard into the rock His back and head
are slammed against it

Schofield is winded disorientated barely staying afloat
Ahead there is a sound

A deep rumbling

He fights to keep his ears above the water to hear it
The rapids are getting faster more turbulent

Schofield realizes what the sound is - the roar of water

Panic flashes on his face He thrashes tries to swim to a
bank

But it’s too late
A waterfall lies ahead

He braces himself and then the waterfall is on him ina
flash

Schofield goes over it

He is pulled down into the plunge pool

We lose sight of him And then nothing He is gone
For a few moments just the roar of the falls

Then suddenly Schofield resurfaces gasping for air

The churning water pushes him free of the falls He manages
to turn onto his back

The river has got wider deeper He grabs hold of a branch

The current carries him The world around him has turned blue
in the pre-dawn light

The river sweeps him forward He is still gasping for breath

Now the tumbling river gradually begins to smooth out into a
cool apron of water

Schofield is almost unconscious He is slipping down his
mouth just above the waterline

His eyes flutter and open he spits out water

Grey mistrals roll through a pale world Unearthly They
hover above the river ahead

The river slowly pulls him Occasional trees line the bank

This place is untouched by war Spared Clean and cool and
filled with some life

Schofield is fighting it but ready to accept that this is
the end He knows too well there are worse places worse
ways

Inch by inch he starts to slip down

His ears fall under the waterline The sound is sucked from
the world His eyes stare upwards Lips just above the water

Schofield seems so peaceful just floating on the water The
sound of the falls recedes

We are aware of birds the wind in the leaves

Then the water around him turns flat The current begins to
slow

White Petals float on it a patchwork blanket
Cherry Blossom
Schofield is swept through the white petals

Schofield raises an arm from the water and sees the petals
clinging to him

Blake

A long beat

Life seeps back into him breaks through the icy numbness
Schofield’s limbs struggle to work in the cold

He fights willing movement

He swims towards the bank

Ahead there are the sounds of a dam a gentle fountain of
water

The sun is rising somewhere - the pre-dawn light is beginning
to illuminate the world around him

He has reached the dam - a fallen tree He begins to haul
himself out He looks down

BODIES
Twelve bodies give or take
SOLDIERS - British German And CIVILIANS Men and women

They have caught and gathered blocked by the tree from
floating downstream They have formed a kind of dam

He takes the only option He pulls himself up and climbs
across the bodies His way out

He makes it to the river bank and stumbles up onto the
slope
EXT RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS

He drags himself across the grass and collapses to his
knees

He cries

Big racking sobs - for the river for life for Blake for
the baby

The morning is forming

Far off in the distance something foreign or long
forgotten

Music Singing

Schofield listens Then slowly gets up walks shaking
towards the sound He stumbles but doesn’t fall His frozen
limbs are forced dragged back to life

Schofield moves up the steep rise He stops and looks at the
woods that now lie ahead of him

EXT PINE WOOD - CONTINUOUS

Shafts of morning light stream through the pine trees

Schofield walks towards the music Uncertain if it is real

The music is in the air a canopy almost directionless He
can now make out a voice And words

VOICE (0S)

there is no sickness toil nor
dangerIn that bright land to which
I go

Schofield picks his way through the thin trees and
suddenly the music has a source

A YOUNG SOLDIER stands in a small clearing

A British COMPANY - about two hundred men - are gathered
around listening

The young soldier’s voice is pure untrained He sings the
old folk song - “I Am A Poor Wayfaring Stranger”

YOUNG SOLDIER (0S)
I’m going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who’ve gone
on

Schofield stops on the edge of the clearing Unsettled by the
world before him Unsure if these men are living or dead

If he is one of these ghosts

He leans against a tree and slumps down on the outskirts of
the group The music washes over him

Dawn is breaking
He closes his eyes Done
YOUNG SOLDIER (CONTD)
I’m only going over Jordan
I’m only going over home

The song finishes A smattering of applause

CAPTAIN (0OS)
D Company MOVE OUT

The men stand up and begin to move Then a voice

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
You alright pal

Schofield opens his eyes A pair of legs before him

PRIVATE SEYMOUR (CONTD)
Where are you from

Another pair of legs

PRIVATE GREY
He’s probably got the wind up

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
Well he’s not one of ours

PRIVATE BULLEN
He’s bloody soaked

PRIVATE GREY
Fuck it let’s just pick him up and
take him with us

SCHOFIELD
(very faintly)
Have to find the Devons

PRIVATE GREY
What’s he saying

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
What’s that mate

SCHOFIELD
The Devons I have to find the
Devons

A pause while the soldiers share a look

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
We’re the Devons

Schofield looks up at them disbelief on his face

SCHOFIELD
You’re the Devons

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
Yes Corp

SCHOFIELD
Why haven’t you gone over

PRIVATE BULLEN
We’re the second wave

PRIVATE WILLOCK
They don’t send us all at once

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
We’re D Company we spent the night

digging in We go last

Schofield staggers to his feet His hand goes to his tunic
pocket to the envelope

PRIVATE SEYMOUR (CONTD)
Are you all right

SCHOFIELD
Mackenzie Where’s Colonel
Mackenzie

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
He’s down at the line

SCHOFIELD
Which way

PRIVATE SEYMOUR
This way We’re headed up there
now

Schofield takes off down the line of men shoving and pushing
his way as the queue of them winds out of the woods

We hear Seymour behind him
PRIVATE SEYMOUR (0S) (CONTD)
Oy Steady on mate Where you

going

Schofield reaches the edge of the wood From the break in the
trees he can see the land stretching ahead of him

The one-day-old British trench is perhaps forty yards away
and beyond it far in the distance on the higher ground is a
black ribbon across the land The German trenches From here
you can just begin to sense the scale of it

A comms trench leads to the front line Schofield staggers
down into it

EXT 2ND COMMS TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

Schofield begins to run along the comms trench stumbling
weaving in and out of the advancing line of soldiers

SCHOFIELD
Move

We catch glimpses of the men as Schofield passes -

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Let me by - Move Let me through

He grabs the first Corporal he sees by the shoulder

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Where’s your commanding officer

LANCE CORPORAL DUFF
He’s in the holding pen

Schofield sprints in that direction - shoving and barging
now

As he approaches the Holding Area we can see THRONGS of
SOLDIERS - The 2nd A and B Companies

EXT HOLDING PEN - CONTINUOUS
The holding area is packed with men

LIEUTENANT HUTTON(OS)
B Company stand to Now listen
and listen well

Schofield spots the commanding voice pushes through towards
the Lieutenant-

LIEUTENANT HUTTON (CONTD)
On the first mark A Company will
advance B Company will then move
to the front line

SCHOFIELD
Sir I have a message from General
Erinmore

LIEUTENANT HUTTON
Who the fuck are you

SCHOFIELD
The attack has been called off
General Erinmore has called off the
attack

The Lieutenant stares at Schofield incredulous

LIEUTENANT HUTTON
Balls man We’re about to go over
We’ve got them on the run

SCHOFIELD
(frantic)
You don’t Please Don’t send your
men over

LIEUTENANT HUTTON
Get out of the way Corporal -

SCHOFIELD
These are direct orders from Army
command Where is the Colonel
Mackenzie

Schofield brandishes his letter Still wet from the river
but legible He looks like a madman Hutton grabs him by the
lapels

LIEUTENANT HUTTON
(furious)
Jesus Christ man Go and see the
Captain

Hutton shoves him away Schofield staggers on pushing out of
the holding area As he goes we hear Hutton bellowing to his
men-
LIEUTENANT HUTTON (CONTD)
Now I want us up there quickly you
understand Do you understand

Hutton’s men respond ‘Yes Sir’ etc

Schofield rushes through them and into -

EXT 2ND FRONT LINE TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
The narrow trench is packed with more men

This trench is hastily dug Little more than a temporary
berm perhaps five feet high Hundreds of men crouch just
inside the trench wall waiting preparing

He pushes past more men And still more

SERGEANT WRIGHT
Sections 9 and 10 at the ready We
will advance on the first whistle
blast

Schofield pushes forwards
SERGEANT GARDNER
You must not slow down If the man
next to you falls keep moving
Your orders are to break the lines -

SCHOFIELD
Where is the Captain

Gardner nods to CAPTAIN IVINS rocking back and forth head
bowed

SERGEANT GARDNER
He’s over there

Schofield gets to Ivins

SCHOFIELD
Sir Sir

Ivins looks up at Schofield he’s crying muttering to
himself terrified Tears roll down his face

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Captain I have a message This
attack is called off You have to
stop you have to stop -

Before he can say more the air vibrates An impossibly loud
sound -

GERMAN ARTILLERY
Shells scream overhead and then - a wall of noise
The air seems to tremble

SOLDIERS press themselves into the walls of the trench take
cover wherever they can

The earth groans as the shells land Pounding the earth all
around Not yet zeroed in on the British Line

CAPTAIN IVINS
(Soundlessly)
No No No

Schofield grabs Ivins

SCHOFIELD
(Shouting soundless)
Where is Colonel Mackenzie

Men cover their ears and squeeze their skulls but the sound
still drowns them Captain Ivins has his hands over his ears
Schofield tries to wrestle his arms away so he can be heard

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)

(Again soundless)
Where is Mackenzie

No response The noise is too much

Some men push their heads against the front wall of the
trench scream into the mud all voices are lost Others
cower into the earth

The noise is unbearable

Schofield leaves Ivins moving faster through the line now as
men crouch and contort themselves low

Schofield pushes forwards

Then twenty yards behind Schofield - a direct hit

The concussion of the blast ripples along the narrow trench
The walls literally bleed earth and chalk

In an instant IVINS his men the entire section of trench
they were in has vanished They simply disappear -

Schofield is thrown forward into a huddle of stunned men

Sound creeps back into the world raspy screams over the
thunder of explosions We can hear a voice in the distance

SERGEANT GARDNER(OS)
Bearers Stretcher bearers

Schofield drags himself to his feet keeps moving along the
trench

German shells whistle through the air all around
Schofield pushes his way along

Fountains of mud and iron burst in No Man’s Land towering
into the sky showering dirt and shrapnel onto the line

Schofield doesn’t stop running pushing through A and B
Companies

The trench gets thinner tapering in-

Schofield fights through the men now running out of space
running out of time

The trench narrows until Schofield can’t get through the men

The PLATOONS have lost their form here there are no gaps
between them everyone is packed together in the chaos

The German artillery is increasing now Every moment is
rocked with noise There is no space no silence

Ahead of him 100 yards down the trench takes another direct
hit But Schofield keeps moving towards it

MEN flow away from the damage Pushing their way towards
Schofield Completely blocking the trench

Schofield pushes forward until the trench becomes impassable
A wall of men with nowhere to go
A burly Sergeant is ahead of him brandishing a pistol
yelling commands trying to regain some sort of order but
his words are lost in the roar of the shells
SERGEANT GUTHRIE

GET BACK Return to your sectors

GET BACK BACK Hold fast
Schofield pushes past him and finds the nearest CO -
LIEUTENANT RICHARDS His eyes are on his men revolver in
hand

LIEUTENANT RICHARDS

Schofield grabs at him screams-
SCHOFIELD

Where is Colonel Mackenzie

LIEUTENANT RICHARDS
He’s further up the line

SCHOFIELD
How far

LIEUTENANT RICHARDS

Three hundred yards He’s in a cut
and cover

Both of them look around
LIEUTENANT RICHARDS (CONTD)
Youll have to wait until the first

wave goes over

SCHOFIELD
No No I can’t

Schofield turns and looks More shells hit the trench Chaos
The way to Mackenzie is impassable Panic mingles with
despair

Richards turns back to his men

LIEUTENANT RICHARDS
7 PLATOON THIRTY SECONDS

Suddenly Schofield climbs up onto the firing step
Richards turns and sees him
LIEUTENANT RICHARDS (CONTD)
You can’t possibly make it that way

man are you bloody insane

300 yards Open ground utterly without cover It may as well
be on the moon

Everything slows Something in Schofield snaps
LIEUTENANT RICHARDS (CONTD)
What the hell are you doing Lance
Corporal
Schofield is on the top step

He stands

LIEUTENANT RICHARDS (CONTD)
NO NO NO NO

Richards and his men watch on in disbelief as an unarmed
Schofield staggers out and into-
EXT NO MANS LAND - CONTINUOUS

Schofield stumbles forwards Shocked that he is now out in
the open

Then he starts to run picking up speed

Now Schofield is sprinting full pelt parallel to the trench-
His breath burns in and out sawing in his ears

Schofield doesn’t stop

His legs thump over the earth

We hear the screech of the whistle Three short blasts

The roar of hundreds of men follows-

Schofield keeps sprinting to the western trench as now SIX
HUNDRED SOLDIERS pour out of the British front line-

Running out into No Man’s Land and crossing in front and
behind Schofield

Hundreds of soldiers heading towards the German lines as he
keeps sprinting to the western trench

The German guns now erupt again
Men fall in their dozens
Hundreds more pour over the top

Schofield is only half way He stumbles falls But picks
himself up and keeps on running

The whole world shakes on its axis as the shells land

The air thunders around him The ground itself bursts and
rolls

A Company are still pouring out into No Man’s Land
Schofield is running running

Through the hail of bullets and shells

Still running

His lungs burn his breath grates in his throat as he runs
Behind him men continue to pour over the top

Schofield sprints the final few feet and -

He jumps desperately into -
EXT 2ND COMMAND TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

He tumbles and lands amongst the waiting men of B Company
now in the breech

Schofield careens through them and hits the ground hard

Men look down at him in horror He brandishes his message as
a Captain SANDBACH closes in on him-

SCHOFIELD
(Breathless)
Colonel Mackenzie

The Captain helps Schofield to his feet and pushes him in the
direction of a dugout-

CAPTAIN SANDBACH
He’s in there
(he turns to his men)
B Company two minutes

There is a lull in the shelling the earth still rumbles
above them with the sounds of distant machine guns but the
blasts have stopped

Schofield runs half limping cutting through the men who are
about to be sent over the top and pushes his way to the
entrance of a dugout

SCHOFIELD
Let me through

ORDERLY DIXON
Hey hey

SCHOFIELD
Let me through

Schofield drops down a few steps a second orderly BYRNE
grabs him Schofield tries to get past

I have to get through I have to
see Colonel Mackenzie

ORDERLY DIXON
What are you doing

SCHOFIELD
I have to stop this attack-

He pushes past Dixon and into-

INT MACKENZIE’S DUGOUT ANTE-ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The two Orderlies have Schofield by the arms now He has no
strength left to fight them

His voice is lost in melee as CAPTAIN RYLANDS sweeps past
him and in-

CAPTAIN RYLANDS
Colonel weve seen flares the men
on the left flank have made it to
the German Line-

SCHOFIELD
Colonel

ORDERLY DIXON
Hold him

SCHOFIELD
Colonel

The Orderlies haul him out of the dugout

EXT 2ND COMMAND TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

Schofield struggles wildly against the orderlies they have
him pinned against the trench wall

SCHOFIELD
Listen to me listen to me I have
a letter I need to see Colonel
MacKenzie

The Orderlies yell over him
ORDERLY BYRNE
There’s no bloody way you’re

getting in there mate

Captain Rylands exits the dugout and bellows down the sector
to two Sergeants

CAPTAIN RYLANDS
Sergeant Send the next wave

The Sergeants yell back in the affirmative from further down
the line

SCHOFIELD
NO

With the last of his strength Schofield throws his elbow
into the stomach of one of the orderlies He breaks away from
them and into-

INT MACKENZIES DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS

Schofield careens into the room A huddle of OFFICERS are
inside their backs to him A commanding voice emanates from
among them

COLONEL MACKENZIE (0S)
Tell Ivins and Murphy to direct
their men to the left flank
Concentrate everything there

SCHOFIELD
COLONEL MACKENZIE

The officers turn on Schofield parting as they do In the
centre staring straight at him is COLONEL MACKENZIE 40s

Mackenzie stands ramrod straight and is immaculately turned
out despite the chaos surrounding him He has a small scar
across his left eye

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
(in a rush)
Sir this attack is not to go
ahead You’ve been ordered to stop
You have to stop

COLONEL MACKENZIE
Who the hell are you

SCHOFIELD
Lance Corporal Schofield Sir 8th
I have orders from General Erinmore
to call off this attack

Schofield offers up the letter The other Officers all react
But Mackenzie doesn’t take it

COLONEL MACKENZIE
You’re too late Lance Corporal

SCHOFIELD
Sir these orders are from Army
Command You have to read them

He holds out the letter to Mackenzie A damp scrap of paper
A Major HEPBURN is listening closely

MAJOR HEPBURN
Shall we hold back the second wave
Sir

COLONEL MACKENZIE
No Major Hesitate now and we
lose Victory is five hundred yards
away

Mackenzie is resolute

SCHOFIELD
SirSir Please read the letter

COLONEL MACKENZIE
I have heard it all before
I’m not going to wait until dusk
or for fog I’m not calling back my
men only to send them out there
again tomorrow Not when we’ve got
the bastards on the run This is
their last stand

SCHOFIELD
The German’s planned this Sir
Theyve been planning it for
months They want you to attack
Read the letter

This catches MacKenzie’s attention He nods to Major Hepburn
get the letter

Hepburn takes the letter from Schofield hands it to Colonel
MacKenzie

MacKenzie opens it Reads
His face utterly impassive Inscrutable

Schofield waits

COLONEL MACKENZIE
Major

MAJOR HEPBURN
Yes Sir

A horrible moment of silence Everything hangs on this

COLONEL MACKENZIE
Stand them down

MAJOR HEPBURN
Yes Sir

Schofield closes his eyes Relief floods his body

The Major runs from the dugout a blast of whistles from the
outside - a signal to stop

Mackenzie addresses his other officers
COLONEL MACKENZIE
Call up the orderlies Tend the
wounded Hold the line in case they
counter

OFFICERS
Yes Sir

The Officers empty out of the dugout Noises of orders being
shouted and whistles being blown seep in from outside

A long beat Schofield senses Mackenzie moving closer to him
They are now alone

Mackenzie speaks quietly
COLONEL MACKENZIE
I hoped today might be a good day
Hope is a dangerous thing
Schofield stands stock still
COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONTD)
That’s it for now Then next week
Command will send a different

message Attack at dawn

Mackenzie looks him in the eye

COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONTD)
There is only one way this war
ends Last man standing

Mackenzie looks him up and down

COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONTD)
Have someone see to your wounds

Schofield is frozen

COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONTD)
Now fuck off Lance Corporal

Schofield leaves the main dugout Major Hepburn stands just
outside the door He grabs Schofield’s arm as he passes
Schofield turns

MAJOR HEPBURN
(heartfelt)
Well done lad

SCHOFIELD
Thank you Sir

Beat

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
Do you know where Lieutenant Blake
is Sir

MAJOR HEPBURN
Blake

SCHOFIELD
There were two of us I was sent
here with his brother

He looks at him The Major understands

MAJOR HEPBURN
Ah

Beat
MAJOR HEPBURN (CONTD)
Well knowing Lieutenant Blake he
would have gone over with his men

He was in the first wave

SCHOFIELD
How could I find him Sir

MAJOR HEPBURN
You can try the casualty clearing
station behind the line
Otherwise

Beat

SCHOFIELD
Thank you Sir

CORPORAL CAIRNS (0S)
Major Hepburn Sir

He leaves A beat while Schofield orientates himself Then he
turns and walks out into -
EXT 2ND TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

The sounds of the wounded and the dying as they pass The
German guns have stopped for now A brief pause

Schofield walks along the line

The B C and D Companies are gathered pulling in the
survivors carrying dying and wounded men along the trench
Lifting them by hand where they have no stretchers

Schofield continues along Searching for officers for
Lieutenant Blake No one looks at him No one sees him He
slips past them a ghost

EXT SHATTERED COMMS TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

Schofield turns the corner and pushes his way along the zig-
zag length of the trench

STRETCHER BEARERS push past him pressing him against the
back wall as they pass with the wounded

SCHOFIELD
Sergeant I have to find Lieutenant
Blake Do you know where he is

SERGEANT
No

Schofield follows them up a slope and emerging out into-
EXT MEADOW - CONTINUOUS

An impromptu field station where several overwhelmed MEDICAL
OFFICERS CHAPLAINS and ORDERLIES from the RAMC tend to the
wounded

Schofield moves to the tent

SCHOFIELD
Sir is Lieutenant Blake here

MEDICAL OFFICER
No idea
(beat)
Move along Corporal

Schofield walks through the tent scanning the wounded
Looking at the faces the bodies

MEDICAL OFFCIER
If you can walk move to the triage
area

None of the men are officers none could be Blake’s brother

SCHOFIELD
Lieutenant Blake Blake Has
anyone seen Lieutenant Blake

He moves through a tent of gravely wounded men The terrible
sounds of the dying None are Blake’s brother

Schofield moves outside He finally stands still hopeless
Sick with his failure

LIEUTENANT (0S)
Now come on boys He’s taken one in
the leg He’s lost a lot of blood

Schofield turns to see an Officer He is following a
stretcher bearer into the field station from the opposite
direction

Schofield stares at the man’s back The sound of his voice
Just an instinct

SCHOFIELD
Lieutenant Blake

The Officer stops and turns to him His similarity to his
brother takes Schofield’s breath away

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
Yes

Schofield is shaky on his feet He sways a bit staring at
him

LIEUTENANT BLAKE (CONTD)
Do you need medical assistance

SCHOFIELD
No Sir I’m from the 8th

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
What the hell are you doing here

SCHOFIELD
I was sent here to deliver a
message--

Recognition plays on Blake’s face he smiles at the mention
of his brother’s brigade moves towards Schofield

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
The 8th You must know my brother

SCHOFIELD
I was sent here with him

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
Tom’s here Where is he

Schofield looks at him Blake’s smile slowly drops A pause

SCHOFIELD
It was very quick

Blake takes it in

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
I’m sorry

Blake nods wordless Schofield goes into his tunic pocket
pulls out Blake’s possessions There is blood on them The

elder Blake’s face is ashen as he takes them His eyes fill
with tears

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
What’s your name

SCHOFIELD
Schofield Sir

Blake nods He looks down at his brother’s possessions in his
hands

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
I’m sorry what

SCHOFIELD
It’s Schofield Sir William
Schofield Will
LIEUTENANT BLAKE
Well you need some food Get
yourself to the mess tent
Beat Schofield turns to leave Then -
SCHOFIELD
If I may I’d like to write to your
mother Tell her that Tom wasn’t
alone

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
Of course

Schofield searches for something to say
SCHOFIELD
He washe was a good man Always
telling funny stories
Blake nods It doesn’t seem enough

Then Schofield finds the right words

SCHOFIELD (CONTD)
He saved my life

Schofield reaches out to shake his hand Blake takes it They
are still for a second

LIEUTENANT BLAKE
I am glad you were with him
(Then)
Thank you Will
Schofield nods He turns and walks away

He is like a sleepwalker Unsure of where to go

He moves away from the makeshift Aid Post and into the meadow
beyond

The grass sways in the breeze This place is beginning to
turn gold in the morning sun Schofield drifts through it

The noise of the horror behind him gradually fades

Ahead on the plain an oak tree towers Untouched On the
high branches leaves dance in the wind

Schofield walks towards it He sits on the far side of it
his back to the trunk The land stretches out ahead of him in
the early light

He listens to the wind in the leaves Birdsong

He undoes his breast pocket He pulls out the small tobacco
tin He stares at it

He takes a deep breath and opens it Two photographs
Schofield lifts them out looks at them

TWO YOUNG GIRLS his daughters They smile at the camera
He looks at the other - his WIFE

He turns the photo over

On the back her handwriting

“Come back to us”

He stares at it for a long beat

The pain on his face ebbs into longing Love

He closes his eyes and feels the sun on his face
