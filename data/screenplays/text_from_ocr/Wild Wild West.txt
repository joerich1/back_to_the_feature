THE WILD WILD WEST

FADE IN

EXT ALFALFA FIELD - NIGHT

A slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop

The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound
SUPERIMPOSE 1868 - ST TAMMANY PARISH LOUISIANA

But suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER --
BZZZ2Z -- until we realize its not the cicadas but
a--

SWOOOSH A lethal razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the
horizon swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME

The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away
chasing a man THADDEUS MORTON wearing a strange
metallic collar -- exhausted horrified about to die

Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees a desperate
attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc But the
ruse is futile The disc goes straight through the
trees slicing a path straight as the crow flies
NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON
dilapidated broken down weathering away in the field
Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES
straight through the sideboards Wood shavings spit
everywhere Theres no stopping this thing

incomprehensibly mumbling pleading for his life

INT FAT-CAN CANDYS - NIGHT

This two-story Victorian building across town is a
gentlemens sporting house in name only Drunken
roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul
the rouged-up tarts

AT BAR - WOMAN

shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry The Toulouse
Lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and
makeup identifying her as a SOILED DOVE A whore -- not
to put too fine a point on it Shes trying not to make
eye contact with two men seated at a table across the
parlor

SOILED DOVES POV - GEN McGRATH AND HUDSON

HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored
suit Long black braids descend incongruously from under
a homburg hat As for his companion

McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus Six foot sweating
like a Devonshire hog with his tattered undersized
Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top
His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to
be a miniature leather Victrola horn McGrath smiles at
our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999

ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE

Eyes widened in revulsion What evil abides in this
Godforsaken place Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB

licks Doras ear then whispers something in it
Something unspeakably vile by Doras expression

DORA
Im sorry That wont be
possible I have tonsillitis

EXT WAREHOUSE - WESTS POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT

The Rebs load the boxes onto the wagon We see the wheel
of the wagon up against the rotted leg of the water
tower

BIG REB
Packer up good Virgil Next stop

INT WATER TOWER - NIGHT

West is unaware that shes watching him not watching
her

SALOON GIRL
(admonishing)
Jim

WEST
Ah this hole is a safety issue
Im thinking what if it starts to
rain and the water level goes up
It could suck you right up Im
protecting you (variations)

Saloon Girl frustrated has grabbed Wests boxer shorts
(with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with
them

SALOON GIRL
Problem solved

WEST
Belle you dont just ram a mans

underbritches into a knothole
You wanna plug the hole you ram
your own britches in there

West is at a loss She moves in for another kiss

The tower starts to topple

WEST
Hand me my gun

It CRASHES

EXT WAREHOUSE SKYLIGHT - NIGHT 11

West crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes The
only people more shocked than he is are the guards and
the Rebs he just dropped in on West picks himself up

smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws

WEST
Okay who just made a wish
Was it you

He looks up at the freaked-out Saloon Girl still in the
tank She hangs on with one hand the other hand
clutches his clothes

WEST
I could sure use those clothes

now

She responds by Frisbee-ing his hat down West picks it

up with a look uses it to cover his genitals

BIG REB

Well we got us a shy nig

But he never gets that word out Bang West lashes a
lightning martial arts kick to the Rebs jaw

WEST
Fought five long years with the
Union Army not to hear that word
again And you boys lost
remember

As the other Reb comes at him he spins still holding
the hat in front of him and whap Down that one goes

West looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman

WEST
How bout some pants

As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap

INT FAT-CANS - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 12
General McGrath checks a pocket watch looks up

impatiently at the Indian Hudson His eyes drift

upwards to the balcony where

ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS

have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk

McGRATH

Im still waiting on my guns and
ammo but I see my men have
brought your merchandise

McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for
Hudson to confirm Hudson nods

McGRATH
I had expected to be delivering it
personally to Mr

Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name
The Indian speaks in a very precise Kings English

HUDSON
My employer here in a brothel
(a small ironic

smile)
That would be quite redundant
EXT STREET - ON CARRIAGE - NIGHT 13

MOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large
very striking woman in livery

As the carriage passes under the gas lamp we can make
out the top-hatted silhouette of McGraths employer
DR ARLISS LOVELESS Clustered around him inside the cab
are three more beautiful women As he strokes the cheek
of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a
cat

INT FAT-CANS - McGRATH AND HUDSON - NIGHT 14

HUDSON
Youll meet him when the time --
and place -- are appropriate
Now

(stands)
shall we go upstairs to check
the merchandise

14

McGRATH
Frankly Mr Hudson I wasnt

planning to walk those oaken
stairs with you Direct me to the
poot sir Something young and
creamy A gamer that takes to the
crop and spur

McGrath looks to the singer (Rita) who beats a hasty
retreat from him after her song So once again McGrath
lays his rheumy eyes on

ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE

Shes oblivious more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the
balcony with the trunk As she starts for the stairs
a mans hand grabs her Its the Eye-Crossed Reb again

EYE-CROSSED REB
You drive a hard bargain lady
All right fifty cents to take
them big juicy lips and

DORA
Still not interested

She tries to pull away But the Reb wont let go

EYE-CROSSED REB
But you gotta be interested
Youre a whore

Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage
The falsetto becomes a baritone growl

DORA
(baritone)
That doesnt mean a girl cant
have high standards

Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice wham
corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw
Rebs eyes roll back and he slumps to the ground

Whooa hoss the Soiled Dove is a man Hes ARTEMUS
GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us
shortly But now as heshe stashes the unconscious Reb
behind the bar straightens bosom and wig

INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

West is trying to get dressed

The

15

As he pulls on one leg of his pants a guard lunges at
him with a knife West hops up on one leg smacks the
guy with a mule kick

Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve When the
hand emerges out of the cuff its balled in a fist --
which coldcocks the other guard

WEST
Could I have a little privacy
here

As if in response the water tower still hovering above
now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents

WEST
Thank you

He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling naked
screaming Saloon Girl in his arms

WEST
Youll have to excuse me
darlin but my evidence is

getting away

West gallantly puts her down jumps up grabs the
overhead block and tackle system and slides through the
warehouse As the HORSE TEAM which has spooked
THUNDERS past

CLOSEUP - WEST
sails onto the runaway wagon As he pulls himself into
the back he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his
hat -- now on his head

WEST

Sorry about there not being any
towels

INT FAT-CANS - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 16
General McGrath leers down a line-up of Fat-Cans girls
Just as he gets to the beautiful singer who looks sick

at the thought suddenly Gordon intrudes Heshe blocks
out the singer poses coquettishly -- sucking a
lollypop

McGRATH

Whats your name missy

16

GORDONDORA
(demurely back to
his falsetto)
Dora Would you like to go
upstairs

McGRATH
Oh indeedy I would

GordonDora starts to go as the Eye-Crossed Reb wakes up
He grabs himher very pissed

EYE-CROSSED REB

Hey cmere Who the hell are you
anyway

McGRATH
Shes mine

Blam McGrath emphasizes his claim by gut-shooting the
Reb The shot makes DoraGordon jump and the room go
quiet As the Reb crumples McGrath turns back to
GordonDora oddly inspired

McGRATH
I feel like a ditty

GORDONDORA

A ditty But General
(trying to be
coquettish again)
my talents really lay
elsewhere

McGRATH
Nothing stokes the fire in my

loins like a ditty
McGrath hauls himher over to the piano player
McGRATH
Youve got some pretty fair lungs
on ya girl now use ‘em
He punctuates with a slap to GordonDoras rump The
other singer (Rita) watches too

INT FAT-CANS - NIGHT

GordonDora is sweating Reluctantly heshe whispers
something to the piano player He clears his throat and
begins singing

( )

GORDONDORA
(weakly)

Buy a drink for the boys

In the backroom for me
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT
West spots the contents of an open box Eyes widen

CLOSE - BOX - DOZEN GLASS VIALS

stuck in sand But clinking together ominously as the
wagon races over the cobblestones

WEST
Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon
full of nitro

West tries to steady the glass vials with his hands
but its no use He quickly climbs over the boxes onto
the buckboard seat But the reins are dragging on the
ground beneath the frothing horses

West leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the
street He pulls himself over the first ones neck
onto the next horse And as he tries for the lead horse
he falls between them

INT FAT-CANS - NIGHT
GordonDora singing Heshe struggles through the song
in a very tough room
GORDONDORA
And tell them I tried
And tell them I cried
Just when it looks like the stone-faced rowdies might rip

himher apart McGrath starts tapping a mud-caked toe
Encouraged GordonDora belts out the next verses OVER

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT

Wests custom boots drag in the dirt as hes about to be
trampled under the hooves of the freaked-out horses And
if he hasnt got enough problems the lynch pin attaching
the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out
CLOSE - BACK OF WAGON - NITRO VIALS

20

CLANKING together like chimes

CLOSE - WEST

Straining with every ounce of strength in his body he
pulls himself up by the harness onto

CLOSE - WILD-EYED LEAD HORSE

West grabs for the halter

WEST

Whoa now

But it doesnt whoa The wagon goes around a corner up
on two wheels Its about to tilt over when West grabs
both the horses ears yanks them back -- screaming into
them

WEST
I said whoa

This approach seems to work

EXT RISE ABOVE FAT-CANS - NIGHT 21

The team comes to an abrupt stop and with it the wagon
hanging over the edge of a steep drop

Jim carefully climbs off He slaps the dust on his
jacket straightens the crease in his trousers When he
looks up a bitter smile

WEST
Well well this is workin out to
be a perfect day My man

HIS POV - VICTORIAN BUILDING - ACROSS STREET

The tasteful sign under the red light reads FAT-CAN
CANDYS And framed in the window General McGrath with
his singing soiled dove

General Bloodbath McGrath

INT FAT-CANS - CLOSE - McGRATH 22

McGrath is clapping with the crowd of misfits who are now
singing along with GordonDora Heshes won over the room

GORDON CROWD
(rousing finish)
And tell them I tried just the
same

Heshe curtsies to rousing applause McGrath beams like
aman with the fire in his loins roaring He grabs his
little songbird and up the stairs they go

Out the WINDOWS we see West tracking them Simul-

taneously going up outside steps

INT FAT-CANS - UPSTAIRS - GORDONDORA 23
leads the sweating leering General down the hall

Heshe quickly opens and closes boudoir doors --

ostensibly to find a free room for their assignation

The real agenda is to find the mysterious trunk

ANGLE ON DOORWAY 1

Quick peek Heshe registers a mild reaction of shock

Closes that door and moves on to

ANGLE ON DOORWAY 2

Quick peek The two rebs sitting on the trunk At their
feet is a wriggling burlap sack The merchandise is alive

GordonDora giggles like a schoolgirl

GORDONDORA
Well thats a new one

McGrath slams the door drags GordonDora roughly

INT BOUDOIR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 24
Our soiled dove has her back to the door as if steeling
herself for the task at hand McGrath beckons her over
to the bed
McGRATH

Dont let the ear scare you I

lost it at Chickamauga
GordonDora squints at the jerry-rigged ear

( )

GORDONDORA
Oh really One can hardly
notice
(fiddles with her
belt buckle)

Would you mind I I
cant seem to release the clasp of
my belt

Say no more McGrath is on her like a flash fidgeting
with it But it pops open revealing a spiraling screen
courtesy of Dr Mesmer His eyes lock onto it

McGRATH
Wha whats this

GORDONDORA
Its a deep deep pool Maybe
your old swimmin hole Getting
sleepy General

McGRATH
(ga-ga)
Yes Im sleepy

McGrath sits on the floor Gordon smiles this is

McGrath reach for his boot knife Just as the deranged
generals about to plunge it into GordonDora

the WINDOW EXPLODES Jim West comes tumbling into
the room kicks the knife out of McGraths hand in one
smooth move West rolls to his feet fixes a gallant
smile on GordonDora

WEST
Didnt mean to startle you maam
Looked like you could use some
help

It takes Gordon a moment to recover He stares at this
black Samaritan obviously having no clue who he is

GORDON
(clears throat to
recover falsetto)
Looks can be deceivin dark
stranger I am perfectly fine

West quickly pats McGrath down removes a revolver and
his bag of gold coins

WEST

I can see that darlin Woman of

your caliber probably gets top

dollar too So here you go
(flips her McGraths

coin bag)
You can run along Ill take care
of McGrath

As West sticks the barrel of his gun in McGraths
gramophone ear Gordons eyes pop

GORDONDORA
No I need him
WEST

Cmon lady You got the money
Have a little dignity

Gordon jerks Wests gun hand away from McGraths head
just as the dog-soldier comes around McGrath suddenly
lunges at him

McGRATH
(bellows ferociously)

He drives his full weight into Jims back pushing him out
into

INT FAT-CANS - UPSTAIRS HALL

McGraths rebel yell brings help from all directions

the perfume bottle on him like its a Colt 45 Now Gordon

LOCK snapping it open Hes accessorized with custom
handcuffs

GORDON
Lets go Hudson hands

Hudson gives a sick little smile reaches for his gun
when WSSSSHT

Gordon starts to snap the cuffs on the perfectly
presented wrists when

escape down the stairs He uncorks a lethal kick sending

a thug flying through the doorway and into the back of
Gordon

Gordon staggers drops the perfumemace BOTTLE which

fist into Gordons mascaraed face pile-driving him back
into the hall While Hudson and his men make their
escape down the back stairs with the scientist sack

The lip-reading is interrupted by the arrival of

ANGLE - TOP OF INCLINE - HUDSON AND HIS HENCHMEN
who come racing up with the scientist-in-the-sack

HUDSON
Federal agents inside sir

LOVELESS
So Miss Lippenreider informs me
(sighs)
Still I believe good manners
dictate we should send out

His cane telescopes out and Loveless pokes the lynch pin
out of the harness on the nitro wagon Then he gives the

wagon the slightest push

LOVELESS
the welcome wagon

Once started the wagon rolls downhill toward the back
door of Fat-Can Candys picking up speed

Then as his female coterie pulls the burlap sack into
the carriage Loveless steps in behind And theyre off

The titles are the familiar animated freeze frames from

the TV show In the two corners are our heroes -- Upper

the other pointed across toward West

EXT WASHINGTON DC - DAY West rides his magnificent black stallion down
Pennsylvania Avenue

Besides horse-drawn carriages West shares the dusty road
with people on bicycles -- the latest craze He finally
pulls his steed up at his destination

EXT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

West dismounts ties his horse to a hitching post and
winces as he puts his weight on a sore leg

INT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

West limps past black floor scrubbers They stop working
to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom
cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place

But not everybodys so impressed As West heads toward
the Oval Office four self-important house detectives
block his way

HOUSE DETECTIVE

Whoa there pardner

(as West stops)
Winning the war may have got you
forty acres and a mule but you
cant just traipse into the
Presidents office Now gimme
that gun

He nods at the six gun on Wests hip West coolly flexes
his hand above it like hes about to draw

WEST
This gun

Then like lightning with his other hand he whips out a
sawed-off shotgun hidden by his jacket He pokes the
12-gauge barrels up against Pinkertons surprised crotch

WEST
Or this one

A voice stops the situation from escalating further

PRESIDENT GRANT (0S)
Gentlemen

The detectives head swivels around to see

ANGLE - OVAL OFFICE DOOR - PRESIDENT GRANT
stands in the doorway

PRESIDENT GRANT
Dont make Captain West any later
for his appointment than he
already is

The detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as
fast as they can West reholsters the gun and
continues

INT WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE

President Grant goes over to his desk lights a cigar
Backlit in the haze the portly bearded figure lives up
to the myth

PRESIDENT GRANT
Been a lot of death threats lately
Cabinet made me hire some damn
detectives
(by way of apology)
Drink cigar

WEST
Thank you sir

West limps across the room to the bar pours himself a
glass of whiskey takes a cigar out of the humidor

PRESIDENT GRANT
I hear you let General McGrath
get away

Now Wests blood is up

WEST
Sir I had him right in my hands
when some half-a-sissy wearin a
dress ruined

PRESIDENT GRANT
(cuts him off)
Artemus Gordon

WEST
You know him

PRESIDENT GRANT

Of course I know him hes the
best marshal Ive got Hes a
genius

(off Wests

incredulous look)
Gordon has proven himself time and
again as a very cunning operator
with a rapacious intellect
Nothing will stop him from
completing a mission for his
President except the impulsive
actions of a headstrong cowboy

West just looks at him soberly Draws his gun and
places it against the Presidents head Grants eyes
widen

WEST
Who are you
PRESIDENT GRANT
I am the President of the United
States

West points the GUN to the ceiling and pulls the trigger

BLAM As Grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down
WEST
Wrong answer Who are you

PRESIDENT GRANT
I am the President of

PRESIDENT GRANT - DAY

(the real one) stands in the doorway hands on hips
surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn
West nudges the fake Grant in the fake belly with his gun
barrel -- go ahead Sheepishly Gordon starts peeling

off his primitive but effective facial prosthetics

GORDON
Sir in perilous times like these
I was simply illustrating how
someone impersonating you could
actually walk right into the very
bowels of the White House

Just as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion West takes

a ceremonial bayonet off Grants desk and pokes a hole in
the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch The AIR
HISSES out finishes deflating with a flatulent R-R-RIP
(Hey the first whoopee cushion)

Gordon scowls at him

PRESIDENT GRANT
Youre clever Gordon One day
itll get you killed

West smirks as Grant looks up at the bullet hole in the
ceiling then fixes West with a disapproving eye

PRESIDENT GRANT

And you West -- not every
situation calls for your patented
approach of shoot first shoot
later shoot again -- then when
theyre all dead try to aska
question or two

(shakes his head)

Working together will be good for
both of you

The place is a buzzing intelligence operations center --
state-of-the-art for the 1860s Maps of the US and
the world are on the wall Various staff and military

Grant stops at a display of daguerreotype photos all

depicting distinguished bewhiskered men

PRESIDENT GRANT
Ten of our countrys best
scientists all kidnapped in the
last year By General McGrath it
now seems

(turns to them)

The fact is gentlemen youve
both been working on the same
case all along Why did it take
you so long to realize it

WEST
Well sir one of us was still
trying to figure out if he was a
man or a woman

The detectives snicker over that one Grants had

enough

PRESIDENT GRANT
I dont have time for this
bickering One week if were to
believe this

Grant holds out a letter to Gordon and West
snatches it reads

Gordon takes the box hurries to catch up with West

38 EXT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

West and Gordon walking toward the hitching post West

is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage
stud He glowers at Gordon who goes over to where

ANGLE - STRANGE-LOOKING BICYCLE

Is parked on the other side of a bush It has the
customary big wheel in the front little wheel in the
back (Hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire
Dual manifolds that sling under the riders legs)

West shakes his head in disgust

WEST
Figures

GORDON
I call it the Bi-axle Nitro-
Combust

WEST

Save it Ive gotta train to
catch

West swings into the saddle He looks at the SNORTING
wild HORSE under him then down at Gordon attaching the
box onto the seat of his Nitro-whatever

WEST
(snaps off a smug
salute)
Yee-haaa

West spurs his horse and leaves Gordon in the proverbial
cloud of dust

Although Wests intentions are clear for some reason
Gordons in no particular hurry He sighs climbs on the
bike takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles
Then finally ready

GORDON
Avant

VROOOM An ENGINE KICKS IN and Gordon rockets forward
(Yep Artemus has invented the first motorcycle) Fiery
exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels
him down the street at about 60 mph right past

ANGLE ON WEST AND HIS STALLION

who both look over in wide-eyed shock The horse rears
as Gordon SCREAMS by -- leaving them in a cloud of
internal combustion

EXT C STREET TRAIN STATION - TRAIN ENGINE - DAY

From in front as it CHUGS TOWARDS us Sitting up in the
spanking new steam engine (No 5) is a white-haired
Coleman The Wanderer is his pride and joy Coleman
pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST
us followed by a tender and two gleaming passenger
cars

Then comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to
catch up

ANGLE - WITH WEST

riding like hell Getting the last ounce of speed out of
his well-lathered steed he finally pulls alongside the
rear passenger car He looks up In the window we see
Gordon engrossed in what hes doing which appears to
be sewing

WEST
Stop this train You hear me

If Gordon hears him he pretends not to He just
casually makes the next stitch

Wests horse has had it Theyre losing ground to the
train At the last second West leans over at full
gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train He
swings out of the saddle hanging on for dear life
blowing in the breeze like laundry

Finally his boot finds a small metal plate to put its
weight on Just as West stands safely on it whoosh
He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding
partition in the roof

INT WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY

The car is like a classy Victorian mens club Bar
stocked with crystal decanters a pool table decorative
pistols on the wall books etc Gordon seated in a
club chair looks over as West falls from the ceiling
into a seat Hes hot dusty and very pissed off He
glowers at Gordon murderously

GORDON
(calmly)
Thanks for dropping in

WEST
Forget the bikes the beards the
fake boobies Put down the
needlepoint and lets settle
this like men

He takes off jacket starts rolling up his sleeves
Gordon remains remarkably cool continues sewing

GORDON
As a matter of clarification this
isnt needlepoint This is

He shows him some real needlepoint

GORDON
Right now Im putting the final
touches on a new invention of my
creation I call it The
Impermeable Its a vest that
when worn under the clothing can
stop any modern bullet fired even
at close range

West draws his gun aims it at Gordons stomach and cocks
the trigger

WEST
Really

Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach

GORDON

But it hasnt been really
tested empirically yet

WEST
Get up

West takes off his guns and puts them on the table

GORDON
(yawn yawn)
Guns I find them so primitive
and unnecessary if one has done
ones proper planning

WEST
Yeah How do you feel about a
fist

Gordon puts down The Impermeable stands with a weary
sigh

GORDON
I must tell you Mr West Ive
always felt that allowing a
situation to degenerate into
physical violence is a failure on

my part

WEST
Well then Mr Gordon you
failed

Whap West unleashes a lightning punch that drives
Gordon across the train car He dabs at his bloody lip 40

GORDON
Im sorry Mr West you brought
this on yourself

Then to Wests utter amazement Gordon puts his hands
together as if praying while at the same time crooking
his right leg stork-like Is this some kind of martial
art Then he bends at the waist and like a ballet
dancer extends his leg out to the wall and flips a
switch

It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down
from the ceiling It whacks West on the side of the
head and sends him spinning back onto the pool table

ANGLE ON POOL TABLE - WEST

shakes it off and is about to attack again Gordon
calmly pokes a hidden button Suddenly the pool table
revolves West is gone

GORDON
I love this train

EXT UNDERNEATH WANDERER - DAY 41

West eyes wide is clinging on for dear life staring at
the ties racing by inches from his face

INT WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - GORDON 42
Gordon pours a fine Bordeaux speaks loudly toward floor

GORDON
The President asked for my
suggestions on how to make the
Wanderer both comfortable and
functional

As he swishes the wine in his mouth

EXT UNDER WANDERER - DAY (SAME TIME) 43

West reaches up to get a handhold in the myriad of tubes
and wires on the underside of the car As he rips one
tube out of the undercarriage

INT WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY 44

Gordon has just settled into the club chair puts his wine
down on the table

GORDON
And while youre down there
you may want to avail yourself
of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail
Egressor

Suddenly SHACKLES SNAP out of the arms of the chair
pinning Gordons wrists Before he knows what hit him
the floor opens and the club chair disappears

EXT UNDER WANDERER - DAY 45

Gordon appears upside down in the chair chagrined at
his predicament West looks from the escape trolley
Gordon was talking about back to his partner

WEST
Only one doin any egressin
is gonna be you

GORDON

(wide-eyed)
Perhaps the President was right
about us putting aside our petty
differences

(recites above the

CLATTER)
The opposite is beneficial from
things that differ comes the
fairest attunement Aristotle

Suddenly they flip OUT OF FRAME and back into the car
shocked to find themselves facing

suit Hes got a fire in his eye brown spittle in the
corner of his mouth where a cigarette butt lives
permanently and a large copper pot in his hand

West looks from the head to the open box

WEST
Thats a mans head

Gordon holds up a strange circular metallic object

GORDON
And this magnetic collar was
around it when his body was
discovered Havent figured that
one out yet

But West is still staring in disbelief at the head

WEST
Thats a mans head

Gordon starts fiddling with a lantern positioned behind
the head

GORDON
According to the Retinal Terminus
Theory a dying persons last

conscious image is burned into the
back of the eyeball like a
photograph Perhaps theres a
clue there

Excited Gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back
of his head Beams of light are coming through his
eyeballs creating a blurry color image on the wall

GORDON
Mortons last image

WEST
Thats a mans head

West turns his head sideways to try to view the inverted
image projected on the wall Gordon realizes the
problem

GORDON
Ah The refraction of the lenses
causes the image to appear upside
down We simply

He turns Mortons head in the vise Its right side up
but still blurry
ANGLE ON WALL - FUZZY IMAGE

appears Its a man who has a tiny Victrola horn for an
ear Hes holding a bloody metal boomerang

Gordon sees something in McGraths pocket

He seems to have something in his

Gordon drums his fingers on his great frontal lobe

West takes the bifocals out of the box casually puts them
on Mortons nose West now gestures to the wall

and fills the cow bladder West squeezes the cow bladder
shut and holds it up to his chest

wearing costumes) wrangle a beautiful and defiant Latina
into the room When she turns we recognize shes the
singer from Fat-Cans Rita is in her early 20s wearing
a 19th-Century camisole so scanty it makes it hard to
concentrate on what shes saying

It stops with a CLUNK Suddenly

bursts open and Abraham Lincoln in a mini-float appears
Its decked out like Lincolns box at Fords theater On
its own power it moves past the laughing party-goers in

Dont you just hate that song

The Southern crowd gasps at Lovelesss dramatic appearance

Why yall look like youve seen a
ghost Its me dear friends
alive and kicking Well alive
anyway

As he giggles the distaff corps surround him and remove
the Lincoln paraphernalia Then step aside revealing

is half a man Literally Cut off at the waist and
mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an
engine he is a man bereft of tuchus kishkes and
everything else in that vicinity that makes life
interesting LOVELESS
(chuckles)
We mayve lost the war but heaven
knows we havent lost our sense

of humor

Dr Loveless looks down at himself smoothes half of his
Fritz Lang Metropolis-style suit His face turns dark as
he surveys the crowd

LOVELESS

Not even when weve lost a lung
a spleen a bladder two
legs thirty-five feet of small
intestine and our ability to
reproduce

(like a preacher)
All in the name of the South

(then quietly)

do we lose our sense of humor

You can hear a pin drop Loveless turns to the foreign
dignitaries

LOVELESS
I owe a deep debt of gratitude to
my friends across the sea for
their comfort and succor

He suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that
surround him Then abruptly manically

LOVELESS
So Mi casa es su casa Ma
maison est a vous Let the party

begin

Loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing Miss
East leans down and whispers in his ear Loveless looks

in Wests direction

Now Loveless wheels over to West West isnt hiding
Hes cocky in the face of rolling danger

LOVELESS
Mr West how nice of you to join
us tonight and add color to

these monochromatic proceedings

West keeps a lid on his temper Two can play at this
game WEST

Well when a man comes back from
the dead its an occasion to
stand and be counted

Loveless smiles slightly

LOVELESS
Miss East informs me that you were
expecting to meet General McGrath
here I knew him years ago but
havent seen him in a coons age

WEST
I bet a man like yourself would
find it difficult to keep in touch
with even half the people you
know

Danger flickers in Lovelesss eyes He looks to Miss
East

LOVELESS
Perhaps the lovely Miss East will
keep you from being a slave to
your disappointment

WEST
Well you know beautiful women
they encourage you one second cut
the legs out from under you the
next

Lovelesss face drops He is no longer amused Miss
East winks at West then accompanies Loveless in the
direction of the study where

champagnes off a passing tray guzzles them then
wipes his mouth on Dolly Madisons bustle As his
eyes sweep the room

He ducks behind a mountain man carrying the French
tricolor When Loveless and General McGrath disappear
into the study and close the door West eases after
them He pauses as he passes the Soiled Dove leans
into her big bouffant He regards a stained-glass window
patterned with a spider over her shoulder

57

WEST
Hey honey I see a big ole
spider up on the wall Hope it
doesnt drop down your pretty
dress

As the Soiled Dove jumps a little West continues over to

the scaredconfused expression Maybe its because she

is not Artemus

portraits of various Loveless relatives The one behind
the desk is in the style of Gainsborough A Loveless
uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor two English
setters by his side a Holland and Holland double held in
the crook of his arm

West turns his attention to the desk blotter Theres a
faint imprint where Loveless drew the map West takes
his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into
the depressions Hes just about to do a rubbing on a
piece of paper when someone swipes it out of his hand

ANGLE ON MISS EAST
Hands on hips she gives him a naughty naughty look

MISS EAST
I said to meet me in the foyer

WEST
Oh the foy-aay Sorry Ive
never been much good at French

But instead of scolding him further Miss East plants an
over-heated kiss on him Tongues are involved As they
break she gives a little nod of approval

MISS EAST
Au contraire

She pushes him down into Dr Lovelesss chair
MISS EAST
So lets see Mr West are you
a dangerous spy of some sort Or

just a handsome cowboy who likes

lock it behind them Hmmm Whats in there As he
starts upstairs Amazonia appears blocking his way

Howdy there big sturdy gal
Yer dance card full

in a foreign language that makes Gordons eyes widen
He understands what she said and its not flattering

position her nearly-naked rear end over the graphite
powder Very carefully he stands pushing her buttocks
onto the desk and then rolling her off The imprint on
her left cheek is perfect But unfortunately its
backwards

CLOSE - WEST
Damn He lets Miss East concentrate on what shes doing
which from the SOUNDS 0S doesnt appear to be a
demonstration of the correct way to butter corn

West spies a mirror on the other side of the room and
raises her ass up into position so he can see the
corrected reflection

ANGLE ON MIRROR - MAP

be Malheureux Point northeast of New Orleans But the
mirror reflects something else of interest

pointing it at the back of Wests head

suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an EXPLOSION
rips the back of the chair where his head would have
been

He draws and SHOOTS the would-be assassin who falls out

of foreigners out a side exit

So you enjoy the party Im gonna
go save the Republic

The Soiled Dove look-alike is speechless Before he
goes West leans in smirks

WEST
But I will say good work on your
bladders tonight theyre damn
perky

And just to dig the grave deeper West lays hands on them
and gives them a little squeeze This immediately

elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the
bejesus out of the black cowboy And hes not the only
one

ANGLE ON CROWD

And with that Gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal

uninterested in Wests imminent hanging In the hubbub

quickly gains entrance to the door

To Ritas amazement Gordon opens his jacket and
unbuttons his vest to reveal a complete miniature tool
shop Quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it
to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots

RITA
Im Rita I was hired here as an
entertainer Not that Im
complaining but what are you
doin in here

GORDON
(looking up miles
of leg)
Looking for some missing
scientists not that Im
complaining

Gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe It becomes a pedal
that operates the wheels rotation Now he removes a bit
and handle from his vest and attaches the cable Starts
to pump his foot Its a foot-powered drill

GORDON
Im a special US Marshal on
assignment from the President

RITA

(almost impressed)
If youre so special how come
youre lookin up here when
Loveless has em all workin down
in the dungeon

(rattles bars

impatiently)
Get me out of here and Ill take
you down there

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999 47 GORDON
Too late The dungeon is
cleaned out It was the first
place I checked right after I
sampled the gumbo Bit heavy on
the okra

But Rita isnt listening to the food review Her minds
racing Finally the LOCK CLICKS and the cage door
swings open Gordon takes the distressed damsel in his
arms lifts her out

RITA
(suddenly a coquettish
smile)
Thank you Artemus was it
GORDON

One doesnt forget a smile like
that Now where in the world was
it Have you ever played the
Empire Room the Bijou Cafe

EXT LOVELESS MANSION - COURTYARD - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

West is lifted onto the back of a wagon With the noose
dangling in front of his nose West addresses the crowd

WEST
Can I have everyones attention
please I think weve hada
series of major misunderstandings
and Id like to take a moment to
clear them up First the whole
drumming on the boobies thing
In my native land Africa my
ancestors used drums to
communicate between villages Im
sure yall can see that this young
girl here can communicate all the
way down to Baton Rouge Hell on
a clear day we might even get
Galveston All I was saying was
Howre you doing My names Jim
Hows your mama

(MORE)

(Al)

WEST (CONTD)

Second misunderstanding That
redneck comment Im getting the
sense that some of you took that
negatively You know some of my
best friends are whiskey-guzzling
pot-bellied rednecks just like
yall here

(then)
That slavery thing I dont see
what the big deal was Hell who
wouldnt want somebody to run
around for them doing chores Are
you going to get your big fat
lazy ass out of bed every morning
and pick your own damn cotton
I dont think so

(then)
Lets head on inside and knock back
some shine Come on back inside

Hang him

The rope catches and stretches

As they slowly touch the ground

Nobody is more confused than West

ANGLE ON CROWD

How the fuck did that happen But before anybody can
figure out Gordons trick rope speak of the devil

GORDON (0S)
Hey-yaa

The crowd turns with alarm to see

ANGLE ON TEAM OF CHARGING HORSES

Nostrils flared and wild-eyed are having their rumps
snapped by Gordons reins Rita holds on for dear life

as the mad Mountain Man drives the carriage at full speed
right into the crowd -- scattering them

ANGLE ON WEST

He sees his opportunity for rescue puts a foot into the
back of George Washington grabs his gun and somersaults
into the air

ANGLE ON GORDON AND CARRIAGE - WEST

lands squarely in the back And just as the rope starts

to stretch around his neck again Gordon whirls around
with a Bowie knife and cuts it

Suddenly theres a VOLLEY of SHOTS from some cracker
sharpshooters West responds with an amazing display of
RAPID-FIRE marksmanship picking off half a dozen of

Lovelesss shooters even while the carriage bumps wildly
on its getaway BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM

WEST
(still pissed
to Gordon)
Hangm

GORDON
(to Rita)
Meet my trigger-happy partner
James West who doesnt seem to

realize that my carefully planned
diversion gave me the opportunity
to search for the missing
scientists

Now West notices the half-dressed bombshell in the
carriage

WEST
Scientist huh

GORDON
This is Rita I found her locked
in a cage in Lovelesss bedroom
Shes an entertainer

RITA
Um maybe I havent been quite
honest about that My name is

Rita Escobar I came to find
Guillermo Escobar the scientist
my father

Gordons eyes pop

GORDON
Professor Escobar He was the
one I almost rescued that night

when
(lightbulb)
Thats where I know you from
Fat-Can Candys you sang before
I did
RITA

Excuse me

THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev 61598 50

GORDON
That was me Burgundy dress with
the bustle
Gordon starts singing the song West rolls his eyes
cuts off the chit-chat
WEST

Look Rita Im sorry you had the
wrong agent working on your case
When I find your father I promise
Ill send him back safely

And with that West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands
on the back of one of the horses He grabs a handful of
mane leans over and unclips the harness And with a
kick in the ribs West is off at a gallop -- leaving
Gordon one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to
chew his dust

RITA
Hes impulsive James

EXT OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT

Dr Loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are
sipping champagne One of them is holding a little DOG
in his arms BARKING at something in the dark General
McGrath stands at the railing uncharacteristically
pensive Loveless rolls over hands him a glass of
champagne

LOVELESS
Well General its been a long
journey from New Liberty

McGrath visibly winces at the sound of it

McGRATH
Sir there isnt a day that passes
that I dont contemplate it

LOVELESS
Yes and so do I So do I
(reflexively reaches
for missing legs)
If Id only had the scientific
understanding of gunpowder and
primers that I have today

McGRATH
Thats not what I meant

Loveless looks at him puzzled then gets it

LOVELESS
Oh you mean the stomach-churning
carnage that earned you your
unfortunate nom de guerre

Loveless speaks for the benefit of the others

LOVELESS
What was that nickname again

McGRATH
(reluctantly)
Bloodbath McGrath the Butcher
of New Liberty

70 EXT MALHEUREUX POINT - MARSH - NIGHT 70

A reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down
to marsh Beyond that is the Gulf of Mexico We

recognize one of the REBS from the cathouse He opens
his pocket watch

REB 1
They oughta be here by now

REB 2
Maybe were in the wrong place

REB 1
(rechecks map)

No were supposed to wait xactly
on this here spot

Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from
the marsh They ready their arms and get in defensive
positions What they cant see through the fog is

ANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK

amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds
passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the
center of the field The contraption has a large cannon
and Gatling guns bristling from several ports The Rebs
cheer their new weapon

THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev 7198 52

EXT MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

Now a MORTAR appears through the turret and FIRES a
ROCKET that EXPLODES over the Reb soldiers illuminating
the field As soldiers shield their eyes from the
blinding light

ANGLE - AERIAL SHOT - LOOKING DOWN ON FIELD

Unbeknownst to the Rebs Loveless has mowed and stained
the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart
board appearance

Suddenly the TANK TURRET OPENS FIRE on them Once over
their initial shock the Rebs FIRE BACK with their
Springfield RIFLES But the BULLETS PING off the tanks
impenetrable skin like goober peas

EXT OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT

Lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large
binoculars on a stand

General McGrath turns from the rail and faces Loveless
outraged

McGRATH
Why you sawed-off sadistic
bastard Youve betrayed us

Loveless turns to him cocks his head

LOVELESS
My dear General after donating
half my physical being creating a
weapon capable of doing this
how did you and General Lee repay
my loyalty You surrendered at
Appomattox So who betrayed whom

Loveless turns to Munitia holding a steno pad

LOVELESS
Munitia make note Turret speed
needs to be accelerated

MUNITIA
(to Amazonia)
Change gear ratio from 22 to 28

Amazonia pushes a sick dignitary away from the rail so
she can get a sight line to the tank with her lantern
semaphore She begins flashing the new gear ratio

AMAZONIA
A bucket for the minister please

Now in the bg we hear the GATLINGS OPEN UP
Lippenreider is reading the lips of the tanks victims

LIPPENREIDER
Scream Scream My head Im
dying Scream Moan Scream

McGRATH
Loveless I demand you give the
order to stop this slaughter now

LOVELESS
(ignores him)
Were going to need more
loading drills Im hearing too
much time between screams

As Munitia scribbles dutifully McGrath shoves her aside
He pulls his pistol

McGRATH
For the last time give them the
order to desist

Loveless his back to him is seemingly unconcerned at
having a gun barrel pressed against his skull

LOVELESS
General I understand your
distress But believe me those
men are not dying senselessly It
is for a far greater cause than
you can imagine

As Lovelesss right index finger finds a black button on
the arm of his wheelchair

CLOSE ANGLE - LOVELESSS WHEELCHAIR ARM

The steel tubes that comprise the armrests are actually

shotgun barrels facing fore and aft McGraths finger
tightens on the trigger

WIDER
McGRATH
Go straight to hell sir

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999 54

LOVELESS
After you sir
BOOOM McGrath has a very startled expression as he

looks down at the aftereffects of DOUBLE-OUGHT BUCKSHOT
As he crumples to the deck Loveless sniffs

LOVELESS
Bloodbath McGrath indeed

The dignitarys DOG starts BARKING jumps to the deck
It sits next to the fallen Generals gramophone ear and

cocks his head With the RCA logo invented we MOVE BACK
TO

ANGLE ON LOVELESS

He sighs at his pale guests They dont seem to
appreciate the efficiency of his slaughter

LOVELESS

Well that concludes the
festivities Ladies feed him to
the crabs

Munitia and Amazonia unceremoniously dump McGraths BODY
overboard SPLOOSH Loveless addresses the
dignitaries

LOVELESS
But my friends that tank is just
a little ol toy compared to what
this countrys greatest scientists
are cooking up for me next So if
Ive piqued your interest bring
1000 kilograms of your countrys

gold to Spider Canyon four days
from now

(starts to roll

off boat)
Now if youll excuse me Ive got
a tank to catch

Cut TO

EXT TRAIN SIDING (NEAR MALHEUREUX POINT) - NIGHT

A black waits ominously on the tracks Its less a

traditional train car than a riveted armored turreted fortress
on wheels Also it currently lacks an engine

Loveless over his shoulder to the foreign contingent

LOVELESS
My destination is both the
future and the past Forget

Paul Revere this will be the most
revolutionary ride in the history
of America

He looks dotingly at the TANK which CLATTERS up from the
battlefield on its treads then drives onto the tracks
Wheels drop down out of the chassis the treads retract
up and the TANK BACKS INTO the rest of the TRAIN

CLANK Its a neat modular fit Black death on rails

The foreigners watch with awe as

ANGLE - LOVELESS

wheels up onto the tanktrain He drops the
expansiveness fixes them with a vipers eye

LOVELESS

If you dont want to miss the
ride have the last payment of
1000 kilograms of your countrys
gold in my hands no later than

Now a rider ENTERS FRAME

EXT MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

West slowly dismounts transfixed by the slaughter on the
pre-fab battlefield Theres something hauntingly familiar

about all this for him -- the mangled bodies the tread marks

But well find out about that later
West draws his weapon and begins walking through the
victims The pace of his search quickens when he isnt
finding what hes looking for -- General McGrath

NEW ANGLE - GORDON AND RITA

have arrived in the one-horse carriage Gordon is trying
to recreate the crime scene Rita trails behind him his
coat thrown over her shoulders trying not to gag as she
passes the mangled corpses

GORDON

It came up out of the lake
from the way these corpses are
positioned laid down a 360-degree
pattern of cannon fire then
disappeared in moments

(puts a foot on a body

scratches his chin)
My God what kind of weapon is it

Rita cant handle Gordons clinical posturing

RITA
Excuse me I think Im going to be
sick

As she walks quickly away West comes over a haunted
look on his face

WEST
It just rolls on and on Makes a
screeching sound -- like a wounded
animal Got a cabin on top with
a cannon swivels round like an
eagles head

GORDON
You saw it

WEST

Heard about it Thought it was
crazy survivors stories

GORDON
What survivors There arent any
here

WEST

slave town just over the border
Just one week before the War ended
in 65 I was in the 9th Cavalry
that discovered it Old men
women children they used them
for target practice

THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev 61598 57 75

Gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts
up Wests grim reverie is interrupted by MOANING coming
from the shoreline They all follow the sound to find

EXT MALHEUREUX POINT - MARSH - NIGHT 76

General McGrath washed up on the shore West looks down
at him Now Rita still looking green around the gills
rejoins the party

WEST
Thats when I vowed to follow
McGrath to the end of the earth

As grey as four-day-old mullet McGrath manages a smile
for his relentless pursuer

McGRATH
(barely audible)
Whats the matter West Thought
youd be happy to find me like
this

WEST
I was hoping to kill you myself

RITA

Thats a nice way to talk to

people
McGRATH

Youll have to live with it As

Ive lived with the blame for New

Liberty

McGrath fades out West grabs him and shakes him

WEST

What do you mean

McGRATH
(opens eyes)
It was Loveless his plan He

operated the killing machine
there Smarter now left it to
others here

With the meaning of it all sinking in West grabs McGrath
by the collar and pulls him toward him

WEST
Where is he Where did he go

THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev 61598 58

The General tries to speak West puts his ear to the
Generals mouth But before he can say it McGrath
closes his eyes for the last time

Possibly perilous

place myself in Lovelesss
shoes

WEST
Good luck on that one

GORDON
(weakly)
Ha ha ha You know I cant
imagine what Loveless -- a man

without any reproductive organs

could possibly want with Rita

Suddenly theres a WHOOSH and Rita falls through the
ceiling and plops in the chair just like West did
earlier He instinctively pulls his gun Puts it
away as Gordon muses about her anatomy

GORDON (0S)
(not realizing shes
there)
Not that Rita doesnt have a
figure that would inspire a
Botticelli or a Raphael

Rita raises an eyebrow looks to the galley as Gordon
comes out with a platter of food He still doesnt
see her there

GORDON
especially her breasts Did
you notice the way one of them
(cups his hands)
Both of them actually to say
nothing of her buttocks

Gordon turns and looks into the car Finally sees her
Changes gears without missing a beat

GORDON
and the group of foreign
ministers at Lovelesss party
What were they doing there

Gordon gestures for West to join him at the pool table
Rita immediately goes for the food 82

How long has she been here

She uses the time to get another bite into her mouth
RITA

This is fantastic You can cut it

with a fork Howd you cook it

(someone appreciates

him)
Well in a daubiere a clay pot
A French method which

West cuts off the chit-chat

What about the foreign guys

They were mad about something
you know Something about a
real bad deal in Louisiana on
purpose

GORDON
The Louisiana Purchase

RITA
And Queen somebody-somebody of
France got swindled

That gets the man of action where he lives

going to happen when we catch up
to Loveless with you on the
train

She grabs Wests hand
RITA

I know youd never let him take me
back Ive seen you shoot

West kinda melts a little This girl does have her
charms Gordon a little jealous puffs his chest out

GORDON
I assure you Rita an attack by
Loveless would be an exercise in
futility
(stands for tour)
Allow me to demonstrate how my
design suggestions have made the
Wanderer impervious to attack

West draws his guns twirls them and reholsters

WEST
Im the impervious part

85 GORDON
Hardly Completely armor-
plated

Artemus raps his knuckles on the wall making a METALLIC
sound Then he smugly demonstrates that the light
fixture is actually a Gatling gun

GORDON
An attacker would find the
lighting inside extremely
unflattering

Finally he moves to the billiard table while Rita nods
and keeps eating

GORDON
And if by some inconceivable
fluke they did manage to gain
entrance
(rolls billiard ball
into bumper)
An innocent billiard ball this
way

presses the number)
But depress the number a

So rest assured Rita you are

completely safe within these

I dont know about you maam but
I know Ill be sleeping a whole
lot better tonight

until he knocks his boot heels together CLICK his

Summoning his last ounce of strength he mule-kicks
sinking the blade into Hudsons leg West grabs him and
shoves him head first into the smokestack The big
Indian plugs it up like a cork in a bottle

Loveless has only a moment to gloat over his marksmanship

one another as the Wanderer skids to a stop

As they pick themselves up Gordon looks to Rita whos
shaken up and scared Now FOOTSTEPS coming up the
stairs

RITA
I wont let Loveless take me
again Id rather be dead

GORDON
(recalling Wests
words)
Thats not a good one to wish for

To defend herself Rita grabs one of the sleeping-gas
pool balls rolling around on the ground Gordon leads
her into the stateroom to lock her in but she grabs his
hand
RITA
Please Artemus dont leave me
alone

Rita closes the door behind him and locks it

standing in the doorway He rubs a raw welt on his neck
from the garrote smirks when he sees Gordon on the bed
with Rita But his smirk drops when he sees the pool

West props himself up looks over at Gordon who has just
regained consciousness

WEST
(mimicking him)
An innocent billiard ball this

West shakes his head disparagingly and stands He feels
the metal band around his neck and surveys the 18-inch
wire fence which has been laid around them in a circle
West is about to step over it Gordon grabs his leg

GORDON

in a monotone)

Listen to me Loveless collared
us with the same metal device we
found on Morton

Loveless turns to Munitia who is loading two 36-inch-
diameter metal discs into what looks like a CD
changerclay-pigeon-thrower

Oh Munitia I hope were not
going to leave evidence behind

in the stateroom

(looks toward bedroom)
Quite lovely isnt she Who
knows I might even become
familiar with her myself

Gordon takes a step West stops him

WEST
And that would become one more
reason why Im going to kill you

LOVELESS
Yes Mr West Im sure a well-
endowed blackamoor like yourself
must find it absolutely
impossible that a freak like me
could fully enjoy the pleasure of
a woman But having witnessed my
use of mechinology so far
wouldnt you think I could provide
myself with something for the

hard-pumping and indefatigably
steely

reads

Gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it But
its too late West has jumped over the fence Then he
hops back inside it He holds his hands out to Gordon
WEST
See Nothing happened

West grabs Gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him
over the fence Now they hear a slight BUZZING in the
air and its not a bee

NEW ANGLE - DISC

comes whipping over the corn straight for Wests head
In a split second he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of

Oh Oh I see Now Im the master

to five minutes ago when I was trying

out a way to get us out of these

Gordon starts moving towards West who is forced to back
up -- looking a tad nervous for the first time in the
movie

GORDON
-- That wouldnt have been any
fun for a certain somebody and I
wont mention any names -- Jim
West -- who decided to take me on
a bracing romp through a cornfield
and play a fanciful game of hide
and seek with serrated spinning
death discs while our only mode
of transportation is in the hands
of a sadistic madman with weapons
of mass destruction who kidnapped
Rita and is on his way to kill

dislodges and instantly sticks to Gordons magnetic

of healing for the wrongs that
have been done to us all

Framed by a large flag featuring the spider emblem he
looks out from center stage of a Greek theater at the
crowd of foreign dignitaries seated around him

LOVELESS
Oh how long have we waited

row of haggard bearded scientists and the manacled
prisoners Gordon (sans disguise) Rita Grant and

LOVELESS

Most expensive cup o tea in
history

As the Englishman dignitary nods soberly

EXT PROMONTORY POINT - DUSK

Wests body hasnt moved The only change is that now

a line of ants crawls across his face We watch hoping
for a twitch something But there is none The ants
march over lifeless eyes swarm onto the bloody cut on

finally Wests eyelids flutter open
WESTS POV - NAVAJO SHAMAN

As West sits up groggily feels his head Hey its

okay As he makes a mental note to always be kind to
animals

Remember the Alamo indeed
(humbly to crowd)

Today Im proud to be able to sit

before you and tell you the wrongs

will be righted the past made

To thunderous applause Loveless signals for the flag to
be pulled down revealing

ANGLE ON MAP OF THE DE-UNITED STATES

There have been some significant internal changes which
Loveless now describes The delegation from each country
stands when they hear their name

LOVELESS

Great Britain gets back the
thirteen original colonies
minus Manhattan

go back to Spain

stumbles in and looks around discouraged

The place has been ransacked The gun cabinets are
empty the Gatling lamp removed All thats left is
Gordons Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses

he finds Gordons belt bucklederringer He opens the
breech Only one dinky bullet He throws down the belt
in disgust

Loveless unrolls a document signs his half of it

LOVELESS
My partner nations insist that we
make this as legal as possible
Personally I like the symmetry of
it After all wasnt it you who
made us sign a surrender at
Appomattox

Loveless snaps his fingers Amazonia drags Grant out of
his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands

PRESIDENT GRANT
Never will I sign that paper
never will the United States ever
surrender

LOVELESS
Well sir were at loggerheads
then arent we And I suppose
the threat of death to someone
with your valorous war record
would mean nothing
Grant sets his jaw intractably Hes right about that
LOVELESS
so if you still refuse to
sign this surrender well start

by shooting your man Gordon

Loveless whirls nods to Amazonia who drags the President
back to his seat pulls Gordon out of his Rita cant
help her outburst

RITA
Artemus

Artemus smiles at her extremely brave under the
circumstances He whispers to Rita and the President

GORDON
(tugs at his vest)
Dont worry Im wearing the
Impermeable

Rita turns to Grant What the hell is that Gordon has
no time to explain as Amazonia hauls him up on the stage

As Munitia aims her rifle Gordon holds up a finger
GORDON
If I may have one request its
that she aim at my heart which
has loved this great country so
much
LOVELESS

(considers for a moment)
Shoot him in the head

GORDON
Great

Munitia cocks her rifle then just as Loveless holds his

hands up for the signal to fire the lights dim

A candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and

illuminates a deep-throated bluesy black CHANTEUSE

who starts singing the popular cathouse song Hangtown
Gals

CHANTEUSE
(singing)
Ohhh Hangtown gals are plump
and rosy

Loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and
forgets Gordons execution instantly And why not

Shes young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way About
six feet tall wearing the blue sequined number Gordon
had in his dressing room

Accessorized with black mesh stockings big feather boa
silver-buckled belt lots of frilly petticoats for those
can-can moves

CHANTEUSE
(singing)
Hair in ringlets mighty cozy

She winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out

her derriere to the crowd They stare mouths agape at
this piece of ass worthy of Othello

CLOSE - LOVELESS

Intrigued Well maybe more than intrigued
LOVELESS
A new girl What a nice surprise

He motions to hold up Gordons execution rolls to her

CHANTEUSE
Painted cheeks and frilly
corsets
(bends over showing
her undergarment)
Touch them

Loveless hears this as an invitation reaches out with
his hand and whap She slaps him right in the face

CHANTEUSE
And theyll sting like
hornets

177

Theres a hush in the crowd Loveless a red handprint
on his face is a little nonplussed Amazonia moves in
threateningly but Loveless stops her starts to laugh

LOVELESS
(making her name up
on the spot)
Ebonia Why are you so cruel to
me

Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet But she
probably shouldnt be teasing a man whos having ghost
aches in certain amputated places

ANGLE - GORDON

waiting to be executed Somethings not quite kosher
about her for Gordon

GORDON
(musing to himself)
I have a dress like that

ANGLE - CHANTEUSE

Now with the crowd singing along she pulls out all the
stops Her gestures and dance moves become more
exaggerated shes in the thrall of her audience

CHANTEUSE
(singing)
Hangtown gals are lovely
creatures
Think theyll marry Mormon
preachers

She sashays over to the French dignitary pulls his
monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it
steaming it up As she pops it back on his face

CHANTEUSE
(singing)
Heads thrown back to show their
features

Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their
relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider

Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia
hands Coleman the keys to the cuffs Coleman looks from
the keys to Ebonia He just caught on COLEMAN
Go Ebonia go

Then Ebonia prances on stage to Gordon cuddles up to
him Gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with
a mixture of amusement and relief Of course its his
Id rather be dead partner Jim West

WEST
(singing)
Ha Ha Hangtown girls

GORDON
Not to sound ungrateful but youre
a little over the top

hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand Gordon looks
worried Whats he going to do with a gun As he tucks

it up his sleeve

Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like

Maybe he shouldve listened about the dress He turns to
Gordon questioningly and inadvertently incinerates one of
Lovelesss goons He howls in pain runs panicked

right into Rita

RITA
Serves you right for staring at
them
As she relieves the charred goon of his keys Loveless

turns to the rest of his goons

LOVELESS

Finally getting it they rush Ebonia Even his 4th of

reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of
Gordons billiard balls He depresses the number and
rolls it at the guards

Mmm-hmm

Gordon grabs West and Rita pulls them behind the bar

Both West and Gordon look after her with yearning as
three goons charge them Coleman amazed at their
torpor quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon
and OPENS FIRE BLAM BLAM BLAM

Three goons drop Gordon and West exchange looks
Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer

COLEMAN

Speaking of the President hes grabbed a dead goons

EXT NEAR SPIDER CANYON - WANDERER - STOPPED - DUSK

PANNING an expanse of canvas comprising a 20-foot wing
span In the bg we hear Gordon SCRIBBLING

GORDON (0S)
Now Bernoullis Principle states
that the air flowing over a birds
wings is moving at a lower
pressure than the pressure below
the wing thats called lift
Course its just a theory its
never been tested

It depicts a wing cutting through the air Arrows
indicating airflow Circular lines indicating life
Only one problem its upside down Gordon remedies
that Looks sheepishly to West who like him is wearing
a leather flight jacket and goggles

WEST
Youre not makin me feel any
better
Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is

connected to the Nitro-cycle

Coleman his ever-present cigarette dangling from his
mouth readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and
Gordons design They look like Flash Gordons

spaceship He passes them out

COLEMAN
Heres a coupla bon voyage
presents

GORDON

Coleman Must you smoke when
handling explosives

Gordon grabs them away from him and sits in the saddle of
the Nitro-cycle West looks at Coleman apologetically as
he stuffs the bombs into his jacket

WEST
Hes just a little nervous cause
no ones ever flown before

West is barely on the back when Gordon kicks it over and
they BLAST OUT OF FRAME

West gives him an encouraging pat

But their speed is not enough to get them airborne

We need more speed

Then in an uncharacteristic move by Gordon he turns the
machine around and heads for the cliff

WEST
Hey uh thats the cliff over
there you know

He guns the accelerator

GORDON
Yes I do know

And with that the Nitro-cycle goes off the cliff It
disappears for the count of five Then suddenly it
swoops up and PAST CAMERA Theyre flying

rather see what happens when I
stuff your ass into that cannon

would suffice

up beneath West He goes crashing down a story

There out of the shadows steps

KNIFE GUY

Hes a mess no hands just brass collars where they

used to be They lock eyes

WEST
So I guess youre the one whos
gonna give me my whoopin

They square off A beat Then a long steely blade
shoots out from where his left hand used to be

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999 109A

WEST
Pfft I got one a those

West reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in
his boot Knife Guy responds by producing another
blade from his other cuff

WEST
But youve got two of those
(beat)
Okay lemme talk to Gordon Ill
see if he can

No time for talk Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of
moves The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding
speed West unimpressed retorts with a lame shake of
his stiletto and boot

And the fight begins

Knife Guy attacks West narrowly escapes each thrust of

the knife and attempts a kick to the groin but comes
up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades
and snaps like a carrot His only weapon gone
WEST
Damn

West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack Sparks
fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but
misses each time hitting the metal railing instead

West rolls to the floor sucking air Knife Guy lands
a kick to Wests ribs And to make matters worse

WRENCH GUY

just showed up He swings his wrench at Wests head
West ducks but gets kicked in the back He sails across
the room lands flat on his back Now

SHOVEL GUY

makes an appearance He hammers his shovel at Wests
groin over and over (West is in a crab position and
backs up to avoid this) West finally gets a kick in
-- it does a moderate amount of damage

Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at Wests
head West escapes it barely

Knife Guy thrusts a side-kick at Wests chest but West
catches his foot holds on for dear life

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999 109B Wrench Guy is inbound with wrench in hand He swings

on West but West blocks it with Knife Guys leg OUCH
West punches both of them Wrench Guy tumbles OUT OF
FRAME

West stands Looking for a way out but no luck
Shovel Guy attacks West ducks and the shovel connects
squarely with Knife Guys blades West crouches and
throws two simultaneous punches each connecting with a
set of jewels

West stands follows it up with a right cross and left
hook and these two jokers wind up OUT OF FRAME

Now the Wrench Guy is on his feet and hes pissed
He attacks West lands a solid kick to the chest and
West flies backward toward a

HANGING CHAIN

which he grabs He scales the gears gets a solid grip
then swings a huge arc across the room gaining momentum
and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time Off

their feet they go slamming onto the metal floor

West lands Knife Guy attacks West uses the chain to
block the blades which are flying at him left and right
Sparks fly West manages to wrap the chain around one of
the knives locks it down and heaves it into the gears
the blade snaps

WEST
No more Mister Knife guy

West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife
Guy wobbles his legs a bit But before West can follow

up

ANOTHER BLADE SHOOTS OUT

to replace the broken one It stops about a half-an-inch
from Wests nose

A struggle ensues but West manages to wrap the chain
around Knife Guys neck and string him up

West throws a kick to his back Knife Guy hanging by
his neck flies through the belly (the chain is on a
track) and out of the mouth of the beast down into

the abyss chain and all

Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West West
grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession

Wrench Guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the
action But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing-
ing wrench sparks fly

West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks
Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME West spins just in time to
land a crippling blow to Wrench Guys back

Shovel Guy grabs the shovel He and West tug-o-war again
West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with
him West elbows him in the ribs He responds by putting
West in a choke hold West swings the shovel wildly but
hits his target -- shovel Guys head

West steps back gets his footing and for good measure
whacks him in the back

Wrench Guy attacks West defends himself with the shovel
and lands a stiff kick to his stomach Wrench Guy goes
down

West turns hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel
and he goes down

Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at
his head West on instinct lifts the shovel and blocks
the deadly blow at the last second

West has now found his rhythm

He swings and shovel and connects with first the
foot then the chin and last but not least the head --
BOINK West drops the shovel and World Wrestling

Federation style picks him up and hurls him into the
space between the gears We wont see him anymore

West pivots and WHACK Shovel Guy plants a neat
little roundhouse kick squarely on Wests jaw West
backs up and catches another in the stomach Then

Shovel Guy really shows what hes made of

He does a series of jump-kicks round-houses and fan-
kicks into the air All perfectly timed all deadly

SHOVEL GUY
I learned that from a Chinaman

West without missing a beat steps on the shovel which
flips into his hand and -- WHACK -- lands a clean one
right on the top of Shovel Guys melon

plate Extending downward encircling his eyes West
soaks him in sighs

ning back-fist to Metal Heads jaw PING That one
really hurt Wests hand that is Metal Head isnt
fazed a bit West throws another shot this time to

up by his lapels and flings him across the room West
tumbles and lands right next to

WRENCH

He picks it up and starts swinging A shot to the body

PING Then another PING Then another PINGGGG
Metal Head lurches forward absorbing each blow with not
so much as a twitch of the eye West furries PING
PING PING PING nothing He goes for the head

backed up as far as he can go His heels are dangling
over the mouth of the beast a thousand feet above the

I believe you gentlemen are the
polar opposites of a moral
dilemma and Im stuck in the
middle On one end we have

Mr West a man of primitive
vigours uncomplicated by
intellect And on the other
theres Mr Gordon A man of
ideas but unlike myself lacks
the passion to kill for them
Hed like to be able to act his
way out of it And for some
reason when hes actin someone
always seems to get killed

Loveless puts more pressure on Wests head he groans
Gordon aims

WEST

(gasps)
Shoot him Gordon

LOVELESS
Im right about you arent I
Gordon And thats why Im
gonna kill your friend here
Then Im going to kill you

POP The SHOT startles Loveless West and even Gordon
But when Loveless realizes that hes not hit he laughs

LOVELESS
After all that you missed

GORDON

Not exactly

He gestures down Lovelesss legs to a punctured metal
tube thats spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over
the deck -- rendering the foot on Wests head powerless
West gets out from under rubs his neck to regain
circulation

WEST
Better than a fountain pen dont
you think
(nods behind Gordon)
By the way your chivalrys about
to be tested

Gordon turns to see

THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev 7198 113 ANGLE - AMAZONIA AND LIPPENREIDER

Charging him They smash into him driving him to the
rail As they pummel him trying to throw him over
Gordon realizes this is no time for passivity He
retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would
make West proud Over the rail goes Lippenreider In
that split-second before she drops Gordon mouths
bye-bye

Before he can savor the moment further Amazonia clubs
him from behind Gordon whirls and hits her so hard it
surprises them both Over the railing she goes As
Amazonia hovers there President Grant gives her the
kick in the pants she needs to go sailing

PRESIDENT GRANT
(to Gordon impressed)

Well be joining them in a moment
if you cant stop that thing

EXT TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK

Gordon turns to see Grant gesturing at the horizon His
eyes widen when he sees the flat mesa they are travelling
comes to a sudden halt at a 1000 foot cliff

Gordon frantically starts pulling this lever and that
Meanwhile

PRESIDENT GRANT
Lets see how clever you really
are

INT TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK

West approaches Loveless

payback

WEST
For almost four long years Ive
been trackin the animal
responsible for the Massacre at
New Liberty And I hear thats you

Theres going to be some

But with the hydraulic fluid the fight has gone out of
Loveless His mechanical legs shrivel before our eyes
and Loveless sinks helplessly to the deck like the

Wicked Witch

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999

Whimpering pathetically he uncouples his body from the
useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair

thats stuck against the railing

LOVELESS

Please West show a little mercy
to a poor defenseless cripple

WEST
(imitating his accent)
Now now Doctor lets not cloud

this otherwise sunny day with that
poor-ol-me-cripple-talk Just
buck up and say to yourself I am
indefatigably hard-pumpin and

steely
Loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it

LOVELESS
After I kill ya I swear Im gonna
boil you down to axle grease

WEST
Now thats the ol doctor I know

But the smile fades from Wests face when he sees Lovelesss
shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist

West has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the
I-beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers
on both BARRELS BOOM BOOM

The SHOTS almost blow the heels off Wests boots They
PUNCTURE a PIPE behind him Steam spews out This is
going to have an effect on something

EXT TARANTULA BRIDGE - DUSK

Gordon and Grant are trying different combinations to
stop the thing Finally Gordon throws up his hands
He doesnt know what else to try when suddenly the
Tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack
and tilts forward

EXT CLIFF - EDGE - DUSK

The Tarantula lurches forward drastically and teeter-

totters on the brink

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999 114A
INT TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK

The sudden stopping jerks Loveless wheelchair free

Despite his frantic efforts hes rolling toward the

opposite railing When the wheelchair hits a pool of
hydraulic fluid on the deck it spins him around 180

degrees

West jumps up grabs a girder The wheelchair spins
under Wests legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into

the railing and wedges there

EXT CLIFF EDGE - DUSK

The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward inches
away from toppling over

INT TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK

The jolt shoots West off the girder He free-falls
through the belly and out into the open air Thinking
quickly he grabs onto the back of Loveless wheel-
chair His arms nearly torn from their sockets His
weight causes the wheelchair to shift now leaving it
hanging on by a thread West reaches out grabs the
wheel of the chair and hangs there

LOVELESS
Well Ill be a monkeys uncle
How did we arrive in this dark

situation
WEST
I dont know Guess Im stumped
LOVELESS

And Im so cotton-pickin afraid
of heights They just give me the
spooks

WEST
Ah dont be afraid Loveless
With this being the last leg of
our journey and all you should
soak in the view youre really
missing something

LOVELESS
Mister West Im gonna cut this
conversation short

WEST
Good one Loveless I didnt think
of that one

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4999 114B

He moves the

LOVELESS

(furious)
Mister West I am faced with a
difficult decision here On one
hand there is the overwhelming
love that I have for myself and
on the other the raw seething
hatred I have for you Now I
could kill you very easily just
by pulling this lever

joystick The chair jerks back

LOVELESS

But of course I would die along
with you I guess the only thing
that I can take comfort in is the
hope that you would hit those
rocks a second before me and I
could enjoy immeasurable bliss
before I vanish

(moving joystick

back and forth)
What to do what to do

West grabs the joystick

WEST
Allow me to make that decision
easy on you Loveless Because
I want to see you dead a hell of
a lot more than I want to live

LOVELESS
Why is it that I have a sneaking
suspicion that although you are
as black as the night on the
outside inside you are yellow

They lock eyes A beat

LOVELESS
You dont have it in you do you
boy

WEST
You were right Lets cut this
conversation short

West yanks the joystick back

WILD WILD WEST - Rev 4997 114c

ANGLE - LOVELESS

his eyes widen The wheels spin for a second finally
catch and in a flash Loveless and West free-fall into
space

LOVELESS
Weeeeeeeeecest

A beat then
ANGLE - CHAIN
which is dangling from the belly of the beast At
the bottom of the chain is the Knife Guy from the fight
scene West is hanging on to his ankles enjoying a
vindictive belly laugh
WEST
(downward)
Now that looked like it hurt

EXT PROMONTORY POINT - CLOSE ON GOLDEN SPIKE - DAY

Its driven finally into place to a rousing cheer PULL
BACK to reveal that President Grant his sleeves rolled
up has delivered the blow

Hats in the air handshakes pictures The specter of
Loveless and his evil plot a fading memory

Grant turns to West and Gordon

PRESIDENT GRANT
Gentlemen I now strongly believe
the United States is going to be
truly united Not because of this
railroad but because of you

THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev 7198 115A

216

Grant scans the crowd every race seems present at this
momentous event He reaches into his pocket takes out
two silver shields

PRESIDENT GRANT

Ive signed into law the creation
of an agency whose sole duty is to
protect the President and the
country from lunatics like
Loveless

(pins badges on

their vests)
Welcome to the Secret Service
Agents No 1 and No 2

216

The President shakes both their hands Gordon resists
looking down

GORDON
Uh just out of curiosity sir
whos Agent No 1

Grant just shakes his head some things never change

PRESIDENT GRANT

I dont think that matters very
much do you Gordon Besides
youll have plenty of time to
discuss it on your new assignment

(hands them piece

of paper)
See you back in Washington
He snaps off a salute starts to go as they read it
Gordon looks up very troubled

GORDON
But sir what about our train

PRESIDENT GRANT
(over shoulder)
Well Im taking it of course
Hell you let Loveless blow up
mine

As they look at one another in dismay

RITA (0S)
Jim Arte

They turn to see Rita approaching them from a crowd of
scientists Shes looking extraordinarily fetching
in a print dress and parasol

West and Gordon sit up like dogs

WEST
Rita You look great

GORDON
Ravishing a vision

She hugs West she hugs Gordon Whos it gonna be

RITA
I just wanted to thank you for
everything youve done for me
before I went back home to Texas

216 WEST
Texas Whyre you going back
there Why dont you come with me
back to Washington

GORDON
Or better still come with me to
Washington I could introduce you
to people I still know in the

theater

WEST
Shes not really an entertainer
remember

RITA
(intercedes)
I cant go with either of you

She looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other

RITA
Its not that you both dont have
your attributes
(to Gordon)
Youre so sophisticated and such a
wonderful cook

(to West)
Jim youre good with a gun and
have great legs

(to both)

And youre both so brave But
Im afraid I havent been
completely honest with you

WEST AND GORDON
Uh-oh

RITA
Professor Escobars not my father
Hes my husband

She gestures to a handsome goateed Latino waiting for

her Shaved and cleaned up

thought

WEST
Rita why didnt you just tell
us that in the first place

RITA
Well I was going to but would
you have really brought me along

hes not the old man we

if I said I was married
Honestly

Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say

RITA
I didnt think so

She turns and starts to walk away Stops and smiles
RITA
At least you still have each
other

As West and Gordon look at one another

217 EXT MONUMENT VALLEY - SUNSET

We gaze out over one of those achingly beautiful John
Ford vistas as we hear our heroes voices

WEST (0S)
You know Arte

GORDON (0S)
Whats that Jim

WEST (0S)
Maybe Ritas right

Suddenly intruding into the fg is a huge metal leg

Then another LEG CLOMPS down and the Tarantula comes
INTO FULL VIEW As our heroes ride slowly into the
sunset
WEST
Besides theres a lot of

other women in the world
GORDON
Thats easy for you to say She

didnt walk off with your best
dress

FADE OUT

THE END
