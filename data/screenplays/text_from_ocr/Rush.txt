December 6th
EXT CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY
Dark clouds passing overhead
The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains (in

Germany) the past three days is on its way out

AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY

A pupil dilates and contracts in the light The eye stares
Blinks Thinks Making evaluations

EXT CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY

The first rays of sunshine break through The voices of
international TV commentators in different languages

COMMENTATORS
in places the track is still
dangerously wet but following a
drivers meeting the decision has been
taken The race is going ahead

INT FERRARI - DAY

LS)

The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
wearing a fireproof balaclava

Highly intelligent he also happens to be World Champion His
name is painted on the side of his Ferrari NIKI LAUDA

NIKI (V0)
My grandfather always said history is
cruel and reductive and no matter how
long we live or how much we achieve -
we are remembered for very little So
make sure its the right things

NIKI stares up at the clouds His eyelids flicker Thinking
Agonizing Wrestling with an all important decision

Is it going to carry on raining Or become dry Should he be
using slicks or wets

EXT STARTING GRID - DAY

We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major
Grand Prix All around us

Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars An
OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign One
Minute

Deafening angry thunder as engines rev impatiently

NIKI
This is bullshit We have no control
over our legacy We cannot choose what
we are remembered for

A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI and shouts in Italian
above the noise (we see sub-titles)

MECHANIC
Mass usa slicks Le vuoi cambiare

anche tu
(Mass is going on slicks You
want to change)

NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren white
helmet number 12 several rows behind him A team of
MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres

NIKI
Otherwise I wouldnt be remembered for
my rivalry with this asshole And the
1976 season

NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him
Another McLaren but with number 11 and a Union Jack

NIKI
What about Hunt Has he changed

MECHANIC
No hes going on wets

The car in pole position JAMES HUNT surrounded by TV crews
mechanics girlfriends hangers-on

The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferraris but
HUNT makes up for this with magnetism The rock star of Fl

NIKIs face a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rivals
glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava
flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS

NIKI
I dont know why it became such a big
thing We were just drivers Busting
each others balls To me this is
perfectly normal But other people saw
it differently

(MORE)

NIKI (contid)
That whatever it was between us went
deeper And changed us both somehow
Forever
NIKI stares then

NIKI
Be allora usiamo anche noi quells da
bagnato
(Then we go on wets too)

The ten-second board is held up

NIKI pulls down his visoras he and HUNTs eyes meet for a
split-second eyes staring

NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
engine The dashboard needle climbs through 8000 9000 10000
RPM

NIKI
Maybe that explains the state of mind
I was in And why it happened The
other thing Im remembered for
(a beat)
On August lst that same year

CAPTION AUGUST lst 1976
The STARTER waves the flag NIKIs foot hits the floor - his
engine screams that deafening stomach rearranging high-pitch

scream drowning out the roar of the 180000 crowd

NIKIs car is catapaulted forward violently the wheel-spin
leaving livid black scars on the asphalt

NIKI gets away first A good start But within seconds theres
a McLaren car right behind him breathing down his neck

His arch-rival HUNT

But as the McLaren roars past NIKI sees a white helmet
Number 12 Its not Hunt Its MASS On his bald slick tyres

NIKI curses under his breath He screwed up Made the wrong
decision Should have gone on slicks He urgently needs to
change tyres

NIKI swerves angrily into the pits Ferraris pit is right at
one end

INT PITS - DAY

Commentary from all the worlds TV stations explaining the
crazy panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the
pits to change to dry tyres

Its chaos A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars

The Ferrari team frantically work Changing NIKIs tyres Four
men with air guns two men with rapid-duty jacks The same
Italian MECHANIC appears “plugs in his headset to the car

MECHANIC
Hair visto Ti aveto detto di usare le
slicks
(See I told you to go on
slicks)

NIKI
Bullshit Wheres Hunt

MECHANIC
There

NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black
helmet roar out of the pits ahead with new tyres on

NIKI

NIKI screams at the MECHANICS who are struggling The airguns
make a high-pitched noisesomethings not right

NIKI
Whats GOING ON

Thump new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac engines scream and

NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT But the delay has cost
him dear

EXT NUBURGRING - DAY

Archive TV commentary from the worlds race COMMENTATORS
stations informs us of the positions

MASS leading HUNT in 3rd LAUDA in 20th
ou

INT NIKIS CAR - DAY

NIKI gives it everything hes got Tearing through the gears
trying to catch JAMES HUNT breaking as late as he can engine
screaming

He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
Swallowtail - passes one car after another Into 13th place
now Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres

NIKIs POV the world flies past in a blur The steering
wheel shakes The car is right on the edge Cannot be driven
any harder

NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
the courseturns left at the Bergwerk corner Crazy speed
And tight Too tight A mistake

Thump his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
inside NIKI tries to counter-steer but is travelling at 155
mph The car jerks horribly to the right

Crunch hits the embankment then Bang hits the barrier
and is thrown across the track

Fire breaks out in the engine NIKIs eyes widen in horror
with another car bearing down upon him

NIKI
No

The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car Crash a
sickening terrifying impact

The car explodes Seventy litres of burning high-octane
gasoline with NIKI strapped inside unable to undo his
seatbelt Locked in a blast furnace

NIKI screams as the flames engulf him 800 degrees
temperature Trapped inside his car

Burning smoke fills his helmet scarring his lungs
oy

oo

Pandemonium commentary in different languages as panicked TV
commentators helplessly describe whats happening

NIKIs POV he can just make out the barely recognizable
figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI

Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
to undo NIKIs seatbelt

Fire extinguishers blast at the car Dry powder extinguishers
Covering NIKIs helmet Blurring his vision as he cries out

in agony inhaling the powder

Screaming voices Panicked reactions On the side of the car
the painted name “Niki Lauda blisters and melts

Then sound fades As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness

FADE TO BLACK

Over this the sound of a ringing phone

INT HOSPITAL AandE UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY

Were in a busy hospital AandE unit Noise Crowds A regular
Saturday late afternoon The phone continues to ring

Finally an attractive station NURSE in her 20s run-off-her-
feet breathlessly picks up the phone

NURSE
Emergency

She covers her ears straining to hear listening to what is
being said Then her expression changes

NURSE
Okaystanding by

The NURSE hangs upthen calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR
colleagues

NURSE
That was the race-track Theres
been an accident A drivers been

injured and is on his way in

Instantly the atmosphere changes A hive of activity as
DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma

All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way

The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
consultant surgeons telling them to stand by

CAPTION EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER

Swing doors open and a pair of shoeless BARE FEET walks
through and into the accident and emergency unit

Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
overallsto reveal a tall good-looking driver JAMES HUNT
(mid 20s) tanned athletic surfer long blonde hair

A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to
describe an Englishman SEXY

Blood trickles from his nose there is bruising to his lip and

the formation (already) of a nasty black eye but make no
mistake He rocks Drop-dead gorgeous

JAMES
I think the racetrack telephoned ahead
that I was coming Hunt James Hunt

JAMES notices all the NURSES staring
JAMES
Whats the matter No one seen a spot

of blood before

NURSE
Are you all right
JAMES
Absolutely fine

10 INT AandE UNIT - DAY

The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES opening his overalls
checking for wounds cuts and bruises

NURSE
We all thought youd been in an
accident

JAMES

disagreement with another driver an
accident

NURSE
What did you disagree about

JAMES
None of your business Ouch

NURSE

JAMES

His wife

NURSE

The NURSE notices bruising on JAMESs chest

NURSE

JAMES looks up Their eyes meet

JAMES
Be happy to show you if you like

INT JAMESS APARTMENT - NIGHT

“Crash the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble
through mid-embrace tearing at one anothers clothes

The apartment is basic Cramped Messy Like that of a poor
student Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints Empty beer
cans A toaster A kettle A stereo A cage containing two
budgerigars

A mattress on the floor

Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike Englands
crumbling economy Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition
leaving behind its strong imperial past

JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall still half-
dressed but already passionately making love

JAMES (VO)
I have a theory why women like racing
drivers Its not because they respect
what we dodriving round and round
in circles Mostly they think thats
pathetic And theyre probably right
(a beat)
Its our closeness to death

JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily tirelessly making love
in the shower

JAMES (VO)

The closer you are to death the more
alive you FEELthe more alive you
ARE And they can see that in you
FEEL that in you The way you live
Willing to risk everything

(MORE )

11

JAMES (VO) (contid)
With no thought for tomorrowas if
each day is your last Its a
wonderful way to liveand the ONLY
way to drive The only way to get that
tenth of a second on everyone else

The lovemaking becomes more intense
JAMES (VO)

To dare to be one step bolderone
step faster

JAMES is covered in perspiration out on the edge

JAMES (VO)
Sure one step closer to death

JAMES and the NURSE both screaming as they approach orgasm

JAMES (VO)
But one step closer to victory too

JAMES and the NURSE both climax togetherand collapse on the
bed Exhausted

EXT CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - DAY

A grotty old race track in South London

JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his
battered old mini They get out She looks up seeing the
mechanics the racing teams the cars

NURSE

before
JAMES
You still havent This is Formula 3

NURSE

JAMES
A lower division Where people like me

sponsors or being talent-spotted to
race in Formula 1

JAMES leads the NURSE into

The NURSE meanwhile drifts over to look at the car where
BUBBLES is making last minute checks

NURSE
Thats the car

BUBBLES
Thats her The Dastle Mk 9with the
Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine
Shes no beauty But goes like the
clappers

An odd-looking car A bit like a giant Go-kart blue with
yellow strips along the side and Jamess name in small
letters It looks small dangerously fragile

JAMES
Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh
The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound
She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck

HESKETH
Nothing to be worried about Does it
before every race Good sign

14 EXT PADDOCK - SAME TIME

JAMES continues vomiting

JAMES (VO)
Theres a lie that all drivers tell
themselves Death is something that
happens to other people Thats how
you find the courage to get in the car
in the first place

JAMES emerges wiping his mouth

HESKETH
All right Superstar

JAMES
Never better Patron

JAMES (VO)
Because bad things only happen to
others right

HESKETH
Have a gargle with this

14 14

JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagnegargles then
swallows puts on his balaclava

JAMES (VO)
Problem is deep down you know thats a
lie That it could happen to you at
any moment
HESKETH
Quick toke of this

HESKETH passes over a joint which JAMES inhales taking a
huge lungful from

JAMES (VO)
So how do you make that terror go
away Well booze is good for that
And wacky baccy But better than
everything else issex

JAMES goes to the NURSEand kisses her full on the lips
then puts on his helmet and athletically vaults into the car

JAMES hits the ignition and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM
as the engine starts

HESKETH
Ahhhh What music They could never
have predicted it those pioneers that
invented the automobile that it would
possess us like this in our
imaginations our dreams Nursie men
love womenbut even more than that
men love CARS

15 EXT PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

JAMES looks over On the side of the car painted markings in
the form of a signature Niki Lauda

JAMES
All bloody Goosesteppers

EXT RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI They go into a corner

NIKI gets there first Up ahead though approaching the second
bendJAMES sees the tiniest slimmest crack to overtake No
right-minded driver would risk it Only a suicidal maniac

Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly

JAMES goes for it Daringly Brilliantly And forces NIKI to
slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash

EXT PITS - SAME TIME

HESKETH BUBBLES DOC and the NURSE watch from the
sidelines

BUBBLES
That move was suicide

HESKETH

It was also quite brilliant God hes
got balls

EXT RACE TRACK - DAY

JAMES carries on driving Flat out

But on the flat NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere As if his
car has 50 bhp more

And overtakes JAMES NIKI begins to pull away And has the
Englishman beaten

JAMES sees red mistand in an act of do-or-die vengeful
madness JAMES goes into a corner far too fast

yanks his steering wheel And outrageously shunts NIKIs
car An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness

NIKI and JAMESs cars both veer offgo into wild lethal
spinsbut luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right
way

and despite being badly shaken dizzy JAMES is able to
change gears and continue driving

NIKIs car by contrast has stalledand now ends up facing
THE WRONG WAY on the track

NIKIs eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow
like a herd of Wildebeest heading towards him

NIKI
Umgotteswillen

NIKI rips open his seat-belt is about to get out of his car
when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car

NIKI ducks then bravely leaps for cover as

SMASH one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car (it
would have killed him instantly)

WHAM another car narrowly misses him
CRASH another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive
Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues

NIKI battered shaken has had an unbelievably close escape
He rips off his helmet furious

And now we see NIKI LAUDAs face for the first time Sharp-
featured Intelligent eyes Dark hair Protruding teeth

Something unmistakably rat-like about him

EXT CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - LATE AFTERNOON

JAMES is on the podium having won Hes with the NURSE and
HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team spraying them with
champagne

NIKI walks past the podium holding his blue helmet and
shouts out still incandescent

NIKI
Heyasshole That was my line I had
that corner

JAMES
You mean the one you spun out of And
finished facing the other way I think
that corner had you

Laughter

19

NIKI
That move was total suicide What if I
hadnt braked Wed have crashed

JAMES

impeccable survival instincts

JAMES makes chicken noises

NIKI
Fuck you Whats your name

HESKETH

Laughter NIKI gives JAMES the finger Screw you asshole

22 INT LAUDA GRANDFATHER HOUSE - NIGHT

A large forbidding dining room NIKIs FATHER and terrifying

GRANDFATHER
Never Racing is for playboys and

footballers and skiers If you want

me into my business

NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER

NIKI (V0)
Its in moments like this that you
discover who you really are

and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for
ever NIKI gets to his feet

NIKI
Fine Keep your money Dont invest in
me But when Im World Champion and I
have the trophy and my name is not
just on the back pages but on the
front too you will regret it

NIKI walks out the old mans insults ringing in his ears

NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen He looks up

NIKI
Why would I defer to him if I am
paying his wages

NIKI writes the cheque STANLEYs smile fades

NIKI ignores

STANLEY
Because hes a proven winner at the

who quite frankly could teach you a
thing or two

NIKI
OK There is one clause missing

STANLEY

The one about mechanics exclusivity

A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss)
providing skeptical commentary about Heskeths debut

hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh
and his team of upper class
enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the
racing community or just comedy

They walk around in their own branded clothing Alexanders
jacket reads Le Patron He speaks to MOSS

Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise
curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals

STIRLING MOSS
Its certainly the first time I can
remember seeing a butler serving
caviar and oysters in the pits

Suddenly pandemonium breaks out Screams Something has
happened A bad accident on the track During testing

STIRLING MOSS
(holding ear-piece)
reports are reaching me of a
serious accident that has just taken
place in qualifying

All smiles fade The party atmosphere changes in a flash
Panic breaks out

The sound of sirens Ambulances rushing to the scene of the
accident All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off too

HESKETH BUBBLES and JAMES look at one another put down their

champagne glasses and follow

two weeks before that race in Spain
we put 20-inch rims on the rear
wheels We get an extra half second
speed on each lap But the Old Man

Thank you I called this meeting
because as all drivers know the
Nurburgring is a race track from the
Stone Ages The most stupid barbaric
outdated dangerous track in the
world Youve all seen the rain which
has been falling this morning Those
of you with experience know the Ring
needs perfect conditions to be even
remotely acceptable in terms of risk
As you can see today is anything BUT
perfect so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race

There would be no change to the
situation as far as points is
concerned The race would simply be
cancelled

get our race fees

Silence No hand goes up No one has the courage to own up

NIKI

Yes I am frightened Always a little
bit when I race I accept every time I
get in my car there is 20 chance that
I could die But not one per cent
more And today with the rain the
risk IS more How dare you accuse me
of lack of courage Let me remind you
I have the track record here I am the
only person in history to do the Ring

in under 7 minutes So actually its
to my ADVANTAGE to race here today
Because Im quicker than all of you

Sure I had a skin graft operation

one unexpected advantage is its
impossible to perspire through a skin
graft so sweat will never run in my
eyes again - which is good for a
driver

CAPTION THREE MONTHS LATER
A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac

A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN rowdy
FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo

They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet
passing other jets when JAMES stops

Hes seen something that has caught his eye

JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet and
walks over to a small private jet (a Learjet 35)

JAMES
I heard you were spending more and
more time in one of these

A hunched PILOT doing final checks The figure turns Its
NIKI His wounds have healed a little but its still a
painful sight

NIKI
Do you fly
JAMES
No

NIKI
You should try it If something goes
wrong up there youre on the edge
but have to stay within the rules
Stick to regulations Suppress the
ego Its good discipline for the
racing

JAMES
And there I was thinking you were
about to wax lyrical about the romance
of flight I should have known better

NIKI
What brings you here

204 204

JAMES indicates his rowdy cool-looking friends

JAMES
A friends wedding At least I think
it was a wedding Might have been a
birthday All a bit of a blur How
about you Been at Fiorano

NIKI
Pre-season testing

JAMES
Already In February Youre
relentless

NIKI
Thank you

JAMES
Im not sure I meant it asa
compliment

NIKI
But it is one Relentlessness is good
Means youre a fighter That you never
give up Behind my back I know some of
you guys call me ‘The Rat Because I
look like one Its meant as an
insult But I dont mind it Rats are
ugly sure And no one likes them But
theyre intelligent With a strong
survival instinct

JAMES cant help smiling Thats NIKI

NIKI
So when do you start testing Next
week

JAMES
Are you mad I didnt just win the
biggest thing of my life so I could
get right back to work

NIKI
Why You need to To prove to all the
people who will always say you only
won it because

JAMES
Because what Because of your
accident Is that other people Niki
Or you I won On the all important
day when it came down to it we raced
on equal terms in equally good cars
(MORE)

JAMES (contid)
You bottled and I had the guts to see
it through

NIKI
Its true You won that race And
believe me if I had to lose that title
to anyone Im happy it was you But
that doesnt change the fact you have
to win again

JAMES
Why

NIKI
Because thats what it means to be a
winner no Its a permanent
condition Never stops or goes away
It stays with you always

JAMES
Thats winning Sounds like losing to
me Some of life needs to be for
pleasure Niki Whats the use of
having a million cups and medals if
you never have any fun How is that
winning

The plane load of JAMESs friends call outCmon

NIKI
Youre right I could learn from you
In hospital the toughest part of my
treatment was the vacuum Pumping the
shit out of my lungs It was agony
While doing it I was watching
televisionyou winning all those
racesand I was cursing you That
bastard Hunt I would shout I hate
that guy one day the doctor said
Mr Lauda may I offer one piece of
advice Stop thinking of it as a curse
to have been given an enemy in life
It can be a blessing too I said
Who are you Confucius He said A
wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends And you
know hes right Look at us We were
a pair of kids when we first met
Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3 Headed
nowhere Now were both Champions of
the world Not bad

JAMES
No not bad

James

NIKI
So dont let me down now I need you
busting my balls Get back to work

JAMES
I will Niki But I intend to enjoy
myself first And so should you You
think you can

NIKI stares A blank look

JAMES
See you on race day Champ

NIKI
You will Champ

JAMES goes NIKI watches him pulled into his plane by his
laughing cool FRIENDS An unmistakable flicker of envy in his
eyes

Then NIKI turns alone and resumes his safety checks
