EXT COMMERCIAL SUBURBAN STREET - COLD FOGGY MORNING

No cars Swirls of newspapers blow across the street
Suddenly a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS BECOMES VISIBLE rising over a
hill As it gets nearer we feel the ROAR of the engine
The bus is a monster As it rumbles by us we SEE SUNNY
MEADOWS HIGH SCHOOL inscribed on the side

INSIDE THE SCHOOL BUS

Grimy Run down School Bus Hell Oppressed grey-faced
HIGH SCHOOLERS sit round-shouldered looking out into nowhere
land

WE DOLLY SLOWLY ALONG the floor TO REVEAL all the students
ankles SHACKLED and CHAINED to their seats The faint rhythm
of a FILE RUBBING AGAINST STEEL becomes louder and louder
until the CAMERA STOPS ON a students hands Seconds away
from filing through the lock on his shackle FREEDOM

The CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL LES ANDERSON sixteen maybe
seventeen Hes the only kid on the bus with a spark of life
left in him

As the bus stops at a RED LIGHT something catches Les eye
LES POV - THROUGH A GREASY WINDOW - A RED BLUR

He wipes the window revealing a RED FERRARI 308 GTB parked
beside the bus outside a CORNER GROCERY STORE The T-ROOF
is off and all we CAN SEE are the LONGEST MOST BEAUTIFUL
LEGS lounging in the passenger seat A GUY walks away from
the car into the store

LES

looks to the back of the bus to the REAR DOOR clearly
marked FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY He teeters on the edge of
his seat about to make a move He looks to the front of the
bus at the

BUS DRIVER

A maniac mid-40s lousy toupee Hes been watching Les in
his rearview mirror the entire time They stare at each
other eye to eye Les holds his ground The driver thrusts
the bus in gear and begins to pull away away from the
Ferrari

Les explodes from his seat charging for the emergency
door The kids come to life watching and screaming with
excitement Les kicks at the door

A RED WARNING LIGHT on the Drivers dash flashes An ALARM
sounds The Driver looks back angrily Then pushes a
button

A STEEL BOLT slams across the door Les slams through the 7
back window -- diving out of the bus onto the street Les
bounces out of a COMMANDO ROLL and runs up the street to the
Ferrari

The bus does a spectacular BOOTLEGGERS turn Its coming
back

LES LOOKS INTO THE FERRARI

Keys dangle from the ignition In the passenger seat is the
LEGGIEST BLONDE GIRL youve ever seen The approaching bus
builds speed Les jumps into the car

She smiles seductively He smiles back Theyre in love

The bus screams towards them Les turns the ignition pops
the clutch then squeals into a right turn slicing onto a

QUIET TREE-LINED SUBURBAN STREET

The bus roars after them barely making the turn balancing
on two wheels

LES RACES DOWN THE STREET

Looks at his speedometer 70 75 80 85 Maple trees
whip by like hes in a rocket ship AWESOME He looks up at
his rearview mirror Its all yellow Miraculously the bus
is right on his tail Suddenly

A LITTLE BOY DELIVERING PAPERS

Hops the curb and bicycles across the street Les about to
hit him yanks the wheel left practically tearing it off its
column The bus bombs by slicing the front tire off the
bike The LITTLE BOY is left there on his seat spinning
around acrobatically on his back tire

THE FERRARI

still trying to lose the bus streaks down a street then
screeches into

NARROW BACK ALLEY

So narrow they spell it with one 1 The bus slams in
rocking and rebounding off the alleys walls Dragging power
cords and live wires sparks shoot out from the bus sides

Les jams on his brakes cuts and slides right onto a

WIDE COMMERCIAL STREET

Les guns it A laser beam With one hand he downshifts to
accelerate with the other he starts to light the girls
cigarette She pulls his hand closer to her looking into
his eyes

But WAIT Up ahead by a GAS STATION theres a HUGE PUDDLE
OF WATER But its not water Its GAS A tank pumps gas
into a tanker fuel truck GAS spews from a ruptured hose
Suddenly we hear a BORING MONOTONE voice

VOICE OVER
Remember Be prepared and look
ahead The driver must see the BIG
PICTURE

CUT TO

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

A dark classroom The sound of a projector Flickering
light An instructional film is being shown to a class of
DRIVERS ED STUDENTS The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the room and
stops in back where we FIND Les Anderson head on his desk
fast asleep resting on his DRIVERS ED BOOKS

VOICE OVER
--In heavier rain your tires may
begin to hydroplane ride on the
water rather than the pavement
Dont panic And especially dont
jam on the brakes Ease your foot
off the gas pedal

INT FERRARI - DAY

High speed Theres no avoiding the puddle Les EASES HIS
FOOT off the gas pedal The Ferrari remains steady as a 15-
foot spray of gas erupts on either side of the car He
finishes lighting the girls cigarette then casually tosses
the match out the window

INSIDE THE BUS

The driver shifts gears with reckless abandon charging for
the puddle Suddenly the puddle ignites Theres a HUGE
EXPLOSION The bus driver JAMMMMS on his brakes Headed
straight for it

INSIDE THE FERRARI

Les and the girl hear the explosion and turn around
simultaneously Theres no bus just a huge WALL OF FLAME
They smile at each other Theyve made it Les leans over
to kiss her but suddenly shes not smiling Her mouth is
open in shock Theres terror in her eyes We hear the ROAR
OF AN ENGINE Les looks back at the road

THE BUS IS HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM

about to smash into them WE HEAR a LOUD HORN which becomes
a SCHOOL BELL

INSERT - SCHOOL BELL

INT CLASSROOM - CLOSE ON LES - DAY

He wakes up startled He has sleep marks on one side of his
face He looks around embarrassed The bell stops

Standing in front of him is the DRIVERS ED TEACHER MR
GASKET the bus driver from the dream The class is getting
up from their desks leaving He motions for Les not to
move

Leaving the class A VERY CUTE GIRL turns to Les twin
sister NATALIE -- shes conservative bookish

CUTE GIRL
(low voice)

something He slept through the
entire course

NATALIE
No hes just brain dead

MR GASKET
(dead serious)

Mr Anderson
(MORE)

MR GASKET (contd)
Its punks like you the paramedics
end up scraping off the roads at
four in the morning

to see

A nut case on a ten speed stop his thirty foot skid a hair
away from Les sneaker This is DEAN Les best friend He
has charm and mischief with a capital M written all over his
face

They both look back at the Ferrari

LES

INT KITCHEN DINING AREA - NIGHT

Dad Les Natalie and Rudy sit at the table Rudy is the
cute ten year old brother you can only find in the movies
As they munch away at their dinner one by one they look up
in awe

THEIR POV - MOM

Looking more like nine years pregnant rather than nine
months she carries the most humongous plate of mashed
potatoes spotted with mini-pickles chocolate chips and
potato chips Instead of putting it in the center of the
table she plops it down in front of her table setting

With the family still looking on disgustedly she picks up
the ketchup bottle and starts squirting it out on her food
(HAPPY FACE)

MOM
For your information this is
exactly what I ate when I was
pregnant with all of you

She downs her first bite It scares them back to their
meals

LES
Dad

DAD
Unh unh

LES

Did you get a chance to look at
those brochures

DAD
(pulling a crumpled
brochure from his back
pocket)
Sure did
LES

Well What do you think

DAD
(flipping through it)
A twenty-three thousand dollar BMW
for a sixteen year old kid whos
never had a job in his life I
think its a great idea

Les is humiliated

DAD
Les you only completed your
drivers ed course two hours ago
You dont even have a license yet

LES
But Dad it wouldnt be just for
me It would be for Natalie too

NATALIE
Dont include me in your obsession

LES
Excuse me Miss Mature Is there
anything wrong with being American

NATALIE
A BMW at sixteen Its more like
spoiled Karl says

Everyone stops what theyre doing ala E F Hutton

NATALIE

Can you people please be serious
for once in your life

(beat)
Karl says that in America the
people are misled to believe that a
car represents freedom and
individuality when in essence it
is more oppressive than anything
else burdening the individual with
materialistic costs such as
insurance gas and repairs

LES
Who cares what your Commie
boyfriend thinks I think wed all
prefer to be burdened with the cost
of an automobile than with bread
lines and two year waiting lists
for a washing machine

RUDY
I agree

Mother starts to boil

NATALIE
You two are so simple its
frightening

LES
Why are you even getting your
license

NATALIE
(upset and getting up from
the table)
Im not hungry

MOM
Natalie if you prefer to eat
standing up thats fine with me
But nobody leaves the table until
we finish eating

NATALIE
This is the most oppressive
environment a child could be
subjected to

Natalie sits down We hear a loud HONK-HONK Les stands up

LES
(wiping his mouth)
Thats for me

MOM
You heard me Les Whoever it is
will have to wait a few minutes

LES

(still standing)
But Maaa

MOM

glasses and isnt ashamed of being dropped off by his mother
He waves to Dean and Les They turn into the party ignoring
him

EXT MANSION - NIGHT

Les Dean and Charles sip fruit punch They sit alone on
the front steps gawking at the hoards of cute girls
surrounding the guys and their cars Impressive but
sickening

DEAN

Charles

(beat)
Why am I so alone here Im good
looking Ive got a great sense of
humor and yet theres not one
single female within twenty yards

Les eyes glitter Hes in a trance

DEAN
You can say good-bye to the
humiliation of public
transportation and not being able
to date someone who isnt
conveniently close to a bus stop
Youre going to be free Les One
of them

(beat)

And on Saturday night when we pull
into Archies Atomic in your moms
Audi 5000 TURBO all this is going
to be at our fingertips In fact
Archies makes this place look like
Sesame Street

CHARLES
To you Archies makes the Playboy
Channel look like Sesame Street

DEAN

Archies is the joint I swear it
My brother used to go there every
weekend He says the ratio of
girls to guys is five to one And
were not talkin dogs were
talkin bunnies The place is a
paradise

(beat)
Im telling you Les The secret
to your happiness and ultimately
our happiness as long as we live
in this country is a drivers
license

CHARLES
You cant possibly believe that
bullshit can you

DEAN
(looking around at all the
cars girls and
happiness)
Charles Seeing is believing

You gotta believe him

LES
Ive bumped into her a million

Mercedes heads for them arguing with her older looking
boyfriend PAOLO He looks very out of place

MERCEDES
You dont own me I can do whatever
I like Women have rights in this
country Not like Chile or
Argentina where they worship their
men

They barge through the boys as if they were a string of

beads Les quivers beside Mercedes as she pours herself
some punch

PAOLO
It has nothing to do with worship
it has to do with going to parties
with with kids

MERCEDES
I happen to go to school with these
kids I have friends here

PAOLO
Friends These children can do
nothing for you

MERCEDES
(cold)
Can we just stop this discussion

will never agree on

PAOLO

Are you coming

Through the walls the classical music builds in intensity

CHARLES

blind pedestrian to whom you must
yield the right of way

DEAN

LES
By their white cane or guard dog

DEAN

This is a complete waste of time
You know your stuff Les Youve

INT NATALIES ROOM - NIGHT

Tchaikovsky Bookish Natalie sits at her desk studying her
Drivers Ed manual taking notes trying to memorize As she
studies her body responds to the music with great intensity
And then relaxes when the music becomes quiet Suddenly
from an INTERCOM above her desk we hear Deans obnoxious
voice

DEAN

(voice over)
Hey Naaaatalie If you were ina
car traveling at the speed of fifty-
five miles per hour and you
collided with a runaway train
would that create any improvements
in your face

Her pencil snaps A total disruption of concentration
Silence And now we hear the loudest and most disgusting
BURP of all time And then wails of laughter And then
Dean again

DEAN
(voice over)
Good luck on your exam tomorrow
Einstein

Paolo stands stunned

INSIDE EL RAY’S

Mercedes storms away On the way out of the club she grabs
the guys MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE from the bucket of ice

OUTSIDE EL RAYS

Les waits for Mercedes She stomps by him back to the car
swigging the near-full bottle of champagne Les turns to
see

THE TOW TRUCK about to pull away with the Caddie Blindly
Les runs across the street Cars screech and swerve He
stands in front of the truck The DRIVER is an overweight
REDNECK covered in grease

REDNECK DRIVER

Mercedes cant believe it

EXT TOW TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Les count out his money in front of the driver The driver
snatches the money and walks around to the side of the
truck

LES
Be gentle Please

REDNECK DRIVER
For eighty dollars

He hits a switch The Cadillac CRASHES DOWN Les is
mortified The redneck driver jumps into his truck
laughing As he drives away Mercedes approaches a
distraught Les After another huge swig from the magnum she
offers him some champagne

MERCEDES
This might help

LES
(harking back to his Dads
champagne toast)
No thanks I already had some

MERCEDES

like it was all my fault

LES
Nah I shouldve given the car to

Mercedes laughs It really isnt funny

MERCEDES
I know a quiet spot with plenty of
free parking

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

A dense forest Cadillac Brougham hell We can barely SEE
the beams of the Cadillacs headlights

INT CADILLAC - NIGHT

The car bounces along on a steep narrow dirt mountain road
more suited for a horse or a 4x4

Whatever it is its not good for the car Mercedes has
moved beside Les The radio is off Les concentrates
Quiet We hear the pounding of the shocks and the occasional
branch scraping the car And then a Mercedes HICCUP anda
giggly “excuse me”

THEIR POV - STRAIGHT AHEAD

Bit by bit the trees vanish Theres nothing but stars
The entire city sits below us glowing like an expensive
broach Its a glorious sight Les stops the car

They get out Mercedes clutching her now three quarters
empty bottle of champagne stares up at the stars Mercedes
is more than light headed Shes drunk Les checks the
condition of the car It looks fine

Les gapes at Mercedes and the surroundings Its a fantasy
come true An awkward silence

LES

This is unbelievable up here How
did you find this place

MERCEDES

Someone I know used to take me
here

(Les is shattered)
Not a boyfriend My father used to
bring me here to show me how pretty
the world could be if you could
step away and see it froma
distance

Les doesnt know what to say

MERCEDES
(Contd)
I havent been here in a long time

Shes about to sit in front of the car

LES
(diving between her)
Wait wait one second I have a
blanket Itll be more
comfortable

MERCEDES
You sure come prepared

LES
(under his breath)
Like a Boy Scout
Les leans into the car and releases the trunk lock

THE TRUNK FLIPS OPEN

revealing an expensive set of GOLF CLUBS Les searches the
bag and pulls out a BLANKET

He races to the front of the car and spreads it out on the
front hood
MERCEDES
(in between swigs)
All were missing is some soft
romantic music

Les grins and whips into the car

INSIDE THE CADDIE

He flips over his MERCEDES tape to the SLOW side He
waits for it to begin Its the perfect song for the perfect
Moment He smiles and adjusts the volume

BUT just as hes about to slide out the sound garbles and

dies He ejects the tape Its destroyed He flips on the
radio The reception sucks HE shuts it off and looks out

at Mercedes filling her glass up He needs music He opens
the GLOVE COMPARTMENT

LES POV —- A ROW OF CASSETTES

Grandfathers top ten Como Bennett Torme Sinatra and
Humperdinck He grabs Greatest Hits of the 40s and loads
it into the deck Strangers in the Night

Nestled in the woods above the city its beautiful I wish
it were me Mercedes deep in thought and alcohol gulps
away An awkward moment for Les He looks out at the
spectacular view

SINATRA
Strangers in the night exchanging
glances wondering in the night
what were the chances wed be
sharing love before the night was
through

MERCEDES
Do you want to dance

LES
To this Where

MERCEDES
(getting up on the hood
with her stiletto heels)
Right up here You couldnt pray
for a more romantic setting

Her heels on the hood are killing him but he doesnt want to
upset the momentum He hops up They get close Shes
taller Its awkward

SINATRA
‘Love was just a glance away a
warm embracing dance away

MERCEDES
Maybe I should take my shoes off

Les looks to the sky as if to say Thank you God They
resume dancing As Frankie sings on they get closer and
closer until Mercedes attaches her mouth to Les Within
moments theyve eased themselves down onto the hood and now
theyre really going at it Passion

SINATRA
‘It turned out so right for
strangers in the night

As Frankie gets into his doobee doobee doos the song fades
and we hear a THUMP

CLOSE ON LES
His eves dart open ANOTHER THUMP Its the hood of the

Cadillac caving in He cant even kiss her now ANOTHER
THUMP He pulls himself away panicked

LES
Get up Get off the hood
MERCEDES
Whats the matter
LES
The hood is caving in Quick get

SINATRA

(the next song)
‘That’s life that’s what people
say’

Les is destroyed Theres a huge deep dent in the hood

LES

(packing up to go)
We have to get this fixed

MERCEDES
(plastered -- drink in
hand)
Whats the rush Les I love this
song
LES

(more to himself)

grandfather

Les leaps into the car Mercedes falls in He tries
ejecting the cassette but its jammed He tries to get it
out Forget it He lowers the volume She wont let him
start the car shes all over him She starts kissing his
neck unbuttoning his shirt kissing his chest

MERCEDES

(sexy)
You have such baby soft skin

He cant resist her He begins to smile Suddenly her head
drops into his lap He winces and then we hear some
SNORING He looks down Shes fast asleep

INT DEANS PARENTS GARAGE - NIGHT

Cluttered with spare parts bikes tools you name it The

dead battery

Les is depressed Deans rolling

DEAN

Les glances at it
CHARLES

How do you know its any good

Dean grabs the mallet and walks over to the hood He lifts
the mallet high into the air assuming the executioners
position

DEAN
Fine But as precise and delicate
a task as it may have appeared

easily put them all back

LES
(nowhere to go)
This place better be worth it

DEAN
The drive alone will be worth it

car Charles staggers out of the car moving as if all his
bones are broken Dean bounces out

DEAN

in grime and dirt it looks okay

walks to the bar like the towns new sheriff The
floorboards creak beneath his white Reeboks The dropouts
stay back cautiously Les may as well be tarred and
feathered

TWO BEASTS with their DEBUTANTE GIRLFRIENDS make room for
Les at the bar THE BARTENDER a cross between Ivan the
Terrible and Ivan the Worst leans over nose to nose with
Les

BARTENDER
(rough sadistic voice)
We just ran out of Kool-Aid

Les chuckles confidently trying not to look intimidated

LES
(dead serious)
Bourbon Straight up

Les turns around to look at all his dead relatives Nobody
in the bar has flinched or said a word We SEE Dean and
Charles looking in from outside Les turns back to the bar
The SHOT GLASS is there overflowing with bourbon

This is a kid whos never had a drink in his life He picks
it up checks it against the light then downs it It may
as well have been Drano He cant swallow He SPITS IT
OUT across the bar trying to look macho Before there can
be any reactions from the peanut gallery

He leans over an inch from the Bartender

LES
(imitating the Bartenders
voice)
I thought you said you ran out of

Kool-Aid

The Bartenders confused Everyones confused Whats up

LES
How bout something with a little
body something with some heat on

it

Challenged the Bartender reaches under the bar and pulls up
a three quarters full bottle of the Devils mouth wash
Theres no label on it only a FIVE-INCH WORM rests on the
bottom The Bartender pours hima glass Everyone gathers
around him the dropouts as well

Beads of sweat dot Les forehead Sixteen years all coming
down to this moment Coolly he pushes the glass aside
CONFUSION He grabs the bottle The crowd GASPS Oddly he
pours the alcohol into his hand through his fingers It
spills onto the bar until hes left holding THE WORM in the
palm of his hand

He takes the worm between his thumb and index finger tilts
his head back and in one motion drops it into his mouth and
swallows INSTANT RESPECT A ROAR OF APPROVAL Within
seconds the music is back on and the place returns to
normal

Proudly Les spins to look out at all his new friends only
to see the DROPOUTS menacingly surround him

THE DRIVER
Step outside worm weve got a job
to finish

Les looks around for help Forget it Ina joint like this
you have to do more than swallow a worm He grabs THE
BEASTS beer from the bar behind him

LES
(shoving The Driver)
Back off man Dont crowd me

DRIVER
(stepping towards him to
kill him)
Why you

But before the driver can do anything Les whips the beer
over his own shoulder drenching the Beast behind him And
then he tosses the empty glass at the driver who of course
catches it Les steps aside The Beast whirls around and
who does he see holding the glass The driver with his two
buddies on either side of him

The Beast winds up and nails the driver sending the three
dropouts flying onto a table full of beers As a MACK TRUCK
at the table is about to hit one of the dropouts A DEVILISH
BAR GUY POPS UP IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA screaming

BAR GUY
(excited -- a la John
Belushi in Animal

From out of nowhere the biggest fist youve ever seen
punches through the Bar Guy like a drill press KNOCK OUT

Dad looks at Mom then Les Eye to eye to eye to eye

LES
(from the heart)
I know I let you down Dad And
Im as sorry as I can ever be that
I disappointed you but as hard as
you try you cant imagine what
Ive learned tonight
(beat)
Please let me drive Dad I can do
it
Dad thinks about it He hands Les the keys gripping his
hand tight

DAD
(right up to his face)
All right but try and drive like
you have a license

Dad lets go of Les hand and jumps in the back with Mom
Rudy rides shotgun Les buckles in

THE MANGLED CADDIE

backs out of the garage stops on the street then squeals
away

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Mom is in pain Dad holds her Les grins

INT ANDERSON HOUSE - DAY

The phone RINGS AND RINGS

INT POLICE PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Natalie on the phone Curious she hangs up Karl stands
beside her full of life He doesnt care about her
problems

KARL
Dont you feel invigorated This
is just the beginning There are
many wars still to wage You and
I Natascha Together we will
bring the running dog imperialists
to their knees

NATALIE
(blunter than blunt)
Screw off Karl And by the way
the name is Natalie not Natascha

She walks away leaving a stunned and at last speechless
Karl

EXT STREET - DAY

Full speed ahead NOT A SINGLE CAR IN SIGHT The light
turns yellow then a quick red The Caddies wheels lock A
lonnnnnng skid Burnt rubber as it screeches to a stop

INSIDE THE CADDIE
Rudy Mom and Dad REBOUND from the sudden stop

DAD
(pissed off)
Les What the hell are you doing
Theres not a damn car in sight

LES
Its a red light

DAD
Les Were rushing your mother to
the hospital not a bridge game
Go through it Just get us there

Les smiles looks both ways then tries to take off Only
one problem the engine is revving but the Caddies not
moving

DAD
What happened

LES
I dont know Im pressing on the
gas but it wont go anywhere

DAD
It sounds like the transmission
(frustrated)
Try the other gears

Les tries them all Nothing Shifting into park the car
JOLTS BACKWARDS as he passes REVERSE

LES
(looking at Dad)
Only reverse works

Dad doesnt like it Mom is in more pain She winces and
groans Dad feels for her

DAD
Alright alright But take it
easy

Les loves it He shifts into reverse turns to look through
the back window braces his arm behind the seat and takes
off

OUTSIDE THE CADDIE

Popeye Doyle screeches the car around and peels away

EXT STREETS - DAY

The Caddie in reverse bombs down the street its right turn
signal on In the left lane is a long WEDDING PROCESSION

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Mom is in great pain Les has to make the turn He zips up
to the front of the line then makes a sweeping left turn
from the middle lane and because an OLD BLIND WOMAN is
shuffling across the street Les is forced to go up ons

THE SIDEWALK

Boxed in by parked cars the Caddie bombs through Sunday
papers and Sunday morning brunch tables A WAITER putting a
RED tablecloth down on a table dives out of the way like a
Matador teasing a bull The Caddie flies through the
tablecloth

A MOTORCYCLE COP ACROSS THE STREET

writing out a parking ticket drops his pencil when he sees
the Caddie crash down off the sidewalk onto the street
joining the traffic The Cop jumps on his motorcycle
switches on his siren and rockets away

WITH THE CADDIE

weaving in and out of traffic left turns right turns its

incredible We hear the SIREN The Cop pulls up beside Les
waving for him to pull over

Dad tries to signal to the Cop that Moms pregnant The Cop
realizes whats going on He waves for Les to follow him
but he hasnt been looking ahead Suddenly his front tire
hits the back bumper of an ANTIQUE CONVERTIBLE The Cop
somersaults over his handle bars into the cars front seat

The DRIVER a red-nosed Irishman does a double-take takes a
look at the flask hes been nipping on smiles and takes
another swig

BACK WITH THE CADDIE

bulleting down the street The hospital is in sight Les
has to catch a yellow light A WATER MAIN has burst
Theres a HUGE PUDDLE IN REVERSE Les rockets through the
light Here comes the puddle Has he learned his lesson

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Les eases his foot off the brake and coasts through Spray
shoots out on either side and SPLASHES through the back
window soaking Mom and Dad Rudy loves it Dad alternates
between caring for Mom and fearing for his life

EXT POLICE STATION - DAY

Down the street from the hospital Natalie leaves the
precinct She does a triple-take when she sees her family
flash by backwards She runs after them

SUDDENLY

A HUGE TRUCK backs out of a SKYSCRAPER CONSTRUCTION SITE A
TOWERING CRANE attempts to lift a HEAVY LOAD OF STEEL GIRDERS
from the trucks flatbed The girders hang out onto the
street

The Caddies headed straight for them We hear a SCREECH

EXT CADILLAC - CLOSE ON THEIR FACES IN THE BACK WINDOW

Horror as theres nothing they can do except pray ten
feet five feet a foot Les swoops the car safely around
the girders and then screeches to a stop in a tow zone in
front of the hospital The emergency driveway is clogged
Natalie runs to the car

TWO ORDERLIES dash out to the car with a WHEELCHAIR Dad
helps Mom out Rudy and Natalie watch Les stays in the
car They rush Mom up the walk into the hospital Dad looks
back Les is standing by the destroyed Caddie ashamed

DAD
(stern)
Come here Les

Les looks down

DAD
Les Come here

Les sheepishly makes his way over Dad puts his arm around
him

DAD
Where did you learn to drive like
that

LES
(relieved)
I dont know Dad I guess last
night

DAD
It must have been some crash
course

Les laughs Dad squeezes him affectionately The CAMERA
CRANES UP TO a birds-eye view high above the scene Dad
with his arm around his son disappears into the hospital

DAD
(voice over)
Maybe we can fix the car before
Grandfather gets home Hell never
notice

Suddenly CONSTRUCTION WORKERS begin shouting and then
running for cover scattering like ants From the sky

THE WHOLE BUNCH OF GIRDERS
CRASH down on Grandfathers Cadillac DEMOLISHING it
As the dust settles the CAMERA CRAWLS its way into the heap
of junk until we CAN BARELY MAKE OUT the radio-tape deck We
hear a click-click The tape starts to play Sinatra
Thats Life

FADE OUT

THE END
