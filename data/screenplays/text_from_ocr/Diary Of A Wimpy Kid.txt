OPENING CREDITS

Tight On a closed book The cover reads ‘Diary’ Pull back
to reveal GREG HEFFLEY is holding the book and directly
addressing the camera Behind him is a WHITE BACKGROUND

Greg is a grown-up trapped in a kid’s body He has a very
matter of fact casual manner about him -- a worldly
confident attitude Even so he remains a likeable boy
because we know his bravura just masks normal insecurity
He’s Bill Murray as a kid

GREG

Okay first of all let me get
something straight this is a
JOURNAL not a diary

(beat)
Right I know what it says on the
cover but when mom went out to buy
this thing I TOLD her not to get mea
book that said “diary” on it This
just proves Mom doesn’t know anything
If I walk into my first day of middle
school carrying this book around I
might as well be wearing a sign that
says “punch me”

INSERT SHOT The cartoon drawing FROM THE BOOK of THE BULLY
DISCOVERING GREG’S DIARY The drawing becomes animated the
Bully punches Greg sending him and the “diary” flying

BULLY
Wimp

BACK ON GREG addressing the camera

GREG
The only reason I agreed to write in
this thing is because one day when I’m
rich and famous I’1l have better
things to do than answer peoples’
stupid questions all day long and
this book is gonna come in handy

INSERT SHOT The cartoon drawing FROM THE BOOK of Greg at the
press conference The drawing becomes animated as reporters
shout questions at Greg

MALE REPORTER
Gregory Tell us about your
childhood

FEMALE REPORTER
Were you always so smart and handsome

Greg waves his journal at them

GREG
Here’s my journal Now shoo shoo
BACK TO GREG addressing the camera
GREG
I actually should have started keeping
a diary -- I mean journal -- years

ago Now there’s gonna be this big
gap from birth to middle school
(beat)
Anyway I think future generations
will be glad I kept a record of this
time in my life but the truth is when
they make a movie or a TV mini-series
about me they’ll probably just skip
over the middle school years and go
right to the part where I’m famous
(beat)
Seriously who’s gonna want to see a
movie about a guy who’s stuck in
middle school with a bunch of half-
grown morons

He tosses the book on a nearby side table ZOOM IN TIGHT ON
THE BOOK AND HOLD

EXT WHITMORE MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING 17

It’s quiet as Greg nears the large metal front door The
school looks idyllic and nonthreatening Next to the door is
a cartoon poster of a character named “Wacky Dawg” welcoming
new students

GREG (VO)
Everybody’s always saying how middle
school is such a big deal But to be
honest with you I wasn’t really
sweating it all that much

He opens the door and is BLASTED BY A WALL OF NOISE
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 18

Greg stands in the hallway All around him is mayhem it’s
loud and packed with kids roughhousing and jostling and
shrieking Greg begins to walk down the hall

GREG (V0O)
Okay so I admit middle school was way
different than what I was expecting
I mean you got kids like me who
haven’t hit their growth spurt yet
mixed in with these gorillas who need
to shave twice a day

recognize them

SMASH CUT TO
A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS 19

Side by side we see before and after photos of several of
Greg’s schoolmates The “befores” are normal cute grade
school students The “afters” look like bizarre hormone
experiments The first photo is of Preston in which his
clear grade school complexion becomes riddled with acne In
the ones that follow full shiny hair becomes lank and
greasy others are stuck in weird awkward phases of their
growth spurts In the last “before and after” A SMALL
NORMAL-LOOKING KID HASN’T CHANGED AT ALL

looking people like me but trust me
we were in the minority

visible at this point

GREG
(calls)
Hey Rowley

GREG (VO) (CONT’D)
Rowley Jefferson is my best friend

The two other kids part and we get our first good look at
Rowley The word for Rowley is “thick” His head neck
torso and legs sit atop one another like a stack of blocks
He has a heartbreakingly open honest sweet face HE IS
ALSO WEARING A BRIGHTLY COLORED SERAPE Greg cringes when
sees Rowley’s nerdy outerwear

GREG (VO) (CONT’D)
But that’s definitely subject to
change

Rowley sees Greg and becomes excited waving frantically
ROWLEY

(way too loud)
Greg Greg Greg

As Rowley heads over to Greg Greg notices some of the other
kids snickering at Rowley

GREG
What are you wearing

ROWLEY
We just got back from Guatemala
(with a flourish)
It’s my serape

Greg slouches in his seat as Rowley spins to show it off
EXT SPORT COURT - DAY

COACH MALONE
Today you’re going to learn how to
play dodgeball right First off no
aiming for the head

MUSCLED KID
(raises his hand)
What happens to us if we hit somebody
in the head

COACH MALONE
Nothing Okay now listen up when I
blow the whistle that means

Coach Malone continues to talk as

GREG (VO)

Don’t ask me what genius came up with
the idea of dodgeball My parents
spent a lot of money on my braces so
I’m pretty sure they didn’t want me to
get my teeth rearranged by some moron
chucking a rubber ball at ninety miles
an hour

Greg go and raises his hand

ROWLEY

COACH MALONE
Do you have an inhaler

( )

ROWLEY

What

COACH MALONE
An inhaler

ROWLEY

Huh

COACH MALONE
Where’s your inhaler

ROWLEY

Where

COACH MALONE
(sighs )
Go sit next to the other guy

Rowley runs off and catches up to Greg As they walk

GREG
The people running this place are
trying to kill us Maybe this is how
they’re gonna fix overcrowding in
schools

ROWLEY
I gotta get my hands on an inhaler
(points to dodgeball)
‘Cause that’s scary

GREG
I’m not scared I’m walking away to
make a point This is just barbaric

ANGIE (0S)
Like the Roman gladiators

Greg and Rowley notice that ANGIE STEADMAN an intense girl
dressed all in black has fallen in next to them

ANGIE (CONTD)

Gladiators were actually slaves that
were forced to fight to the death just
for people’s entertainment

ROWLEY

Really

Greg shoots Rowley a look that says “don’t engage”

ANGIE
I’m glad somebody around here finally
sees the parallel
(then)
I’m Angie This is my second year
and I’m telling you middle school is
nothing but a bad joke

Through the following Greg gets increasingly annoyed by
Rowley’s attention to Angie

ANGIE (CONTD)
And the crazy thing is all the adults
know it but they keep it to
themselves I mean you hear them
talk all the time about how fun high
school was and how cute they were in
elementary school But you never
ever hear them saying they wish they
could be back in middle school They
never mention it at all

ROWLEY
(locked in)
That’s true

Greg pulls Rowley away

GREG
(to Angie)
I think the girls are supposed to be
over there

As they move off

GREG (CONTD)

Rowley you gotta stay away from the
nutsos We’re projecting an image
here it’s a very delicate time

They continue toward an empty spot on the blacktop looking
over their shoulders at the dodgeball game They watch
CHIRAG GUPTA a little Indian boy get nailed by four balls
at once Greg turns away just in time to see AN OLD GROSS
SLICE OF CHEESE right in front of them

GREG (CONTD)
Whoa Check it out

ROWLEY

Greg squats down next to it It’s a slice of cheddar deli-
cut He reaches out with his finger and is about to touch
it --

CHIRAG (0OS)
Stop

Alarmed Greg and Rowley turn to see Chirag run up battle-
wounded and out of breath

GREG
What Chirag

CHIRAG
You almost got the Cheese Touch

GREG
The what

Chirag takes a deep breath and then begins speaking almost
mystically

CHIRAG
A long time ago -- no one knows how
long -- that cheese just appeared on

the blacktop No one ever threw it
away and so there it sat growing
more foul by the day Then one day a
kid -- some say his name was Bernard --
made the biggest mistake of his life

FLASHBACK TO
25 EXT SPORT COURT - DAY 25

BERNARD a curious kid squats over the cheese and innocently
touches it with his finger

Another kid (KID 1) sees him do it and points

KID 1
Bernard touched the cheese Bernard
touched the cheese

A crowd of kids runs over pointing and screaming as if they
see a zombie

CHIRAG (VO)
From that day on Bernard had the
Cheese Touch

END FLASHBACK

EXT SPORT COURT - CONTINUOUS 26
Chirag continues his tale

CHIRAG
No one would go near Bernard because
if they touched him they would get
the Cheese Touch Bernard became an
outcast Until that is he was able
to pass the Cheese Touch onto an
unsuspecting foreign exchange student

FLASHBACK TO
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 27
DIETER a happy looking German foreign exchange student
talks to a group of kids Bernard sneaks up to the edge of
the circle and touches Dieter on the shoulder The other

kids recoil from a confused Dieter

DIETER
Was soll das

One kid (KID 2) points at him in horror

KID 2
Cheese touch

CHIRAG (VO)
And so it went from student to
student from year to year

As Chirag speaks we see a ROGUE’S GALLERY OF CHEESE TOUCH
VICTIMS through the years Most are boys but some are
unhappy looking girls
END FLASHBACK

As Greg and Rowley listen to Chirag

END FLASHBACK

Chirag looks at them dolefully
CHIRAG
And so today the cheese sits
patiently waiting for a new victim
GREG ROWLEY

(blown away)
Wow

CHIRAG
This is a terrible place

Greg and Rowley look at the cheese When they look up
CHIRAG IS GONE Coach Malone blows his whistle signalling
the end of PE

ROWLEY
Maybe we should just throw it away
Rowley starts to reach for the cheese -- Greg quickly holds
him back
GREG

Geez Rowley
INT CAFETERIA - DAY 31

The cafeteria is just as loud and untamed as the rest of the
school -- there’s yelling pushing maybe some food flying in
places Greg and Rowley move through the lunch line pushing
their trays

GREG
By the way second floor bathroom No
stall doors I learned that the hard
way

ROWLEY
What If there’s no doors people can
see you And all your business

GREG
Yeah well worse than them seeing you
is you seeing them Trust me you
don’t want to lock eyes with some
strange guy sitting on a toilet It’s
a weird feeling

Rowley shudders The lunch lady hands Greg a plate of
yellow lumpy goop (chicken a la king) He and Rowley head
toward the table area

They see a few empty seats at a table of kids Greg starts
to put his tray down

LUNCH KID
That seat’s saved
GREG
For who
LUNCH KID

It’s saved
Greg moves toward another empty seat at the table

LUNCH KID
That seat’s saved

Greg moves to the last empty seat He looks at the kid who

just shakes his head Greg looks around at the others at the
table they ignore him and Rowley as if they don’t exist

INT CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER 32
Greg decides to try his luck with some shaggy looking

skateboard kids He crosses to their table but they take

one look at him and Rowley

Greg and Rowley have found a couple of lonely chairs in the
corner and awkwardly try to eat with their lunch trays on
their laps FREGLEY a thin hyper kid who breathes through
his teeth in a way that often makes a whistling sound
approaches with a lunch tray

FREGLEY
Hey Greg Heffley Want to see my
secret freckle

GREG
No thanks Fregley

Fregley sits down on the floor next to them Greg tries to
cut his chicken but without a table it’s hard to do and the
chicken goes flying off of his plate and plops on the floor
near Fregley They all look at it

FREGLEY
Are you going to finish that

35 EXT WHITMORE MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY 35

Kids stream out at the end of the school day Greg and
Rowley are mid-pack

Quentin’s two buddies ARTHUR and JOE approach

QUENTIN
This guy says to that guy want to

Greg grimaces at Quentin and his friends’ scornful
expressions

GREG (VO)
This was hard to take because in
twenty years all these mouth-breathers
would be working for me

It’s Greg the same actor but with a mustache and wearing a
short sleeve dress shirt with a tie He holds a clipboard
and watches Quentin Joe and Arthur (also with mustaches)
struggle mightily to put a heavy crate on a high shelf

GREG
Thanks a lot Rowley

ROWLEY

GREG
We’re in middle school now Nobody

ROWLEY
What’s the difference

GREG
The difference is we can’t act like

Oh Okay got it

ROWLEY NONCHALANTLY GRABS HIS BIG WHEEL which is parked next
to a bunch of bikes Greg looks at the Big Wheel in horror

GREG

distracted

GREG (VO)
When we got home I tried to unwind
but I couldn’t stop thinking about
school And I’m worried about Rowley
He’1l never be able to figure out how
to make it through that place He
lacks nuance I mean you can beat
him at a video game just by naming
your car something ridiculous

On the TV Greg’s car passes Rowley’s

ROBOT VIDEO GAME VOICE
Bad Fart ahead

ROWLEY
(falls over laughing)
Bwaahahaha

In imitation Manny laughs and falls off his potty

ROWLEY (CONT’D)
Let’s race again

Greg switches off the game Rowley looks at him
questioningly Manny mimics Rowley and also looks at Greg
questioningly
GREG
Rowley you need to focus Our first
day sucked

ROWLEY

It did
Greg looks at Rowley like “Is anybody home”

GREG
We’re nobodies at school I don’t
know about you but I never envisioned
myself as the guy who has to eat lunch
off his lap That is okay for Fregley
but not me

ROWLEY
My mom told me to just be myself and
people would like me

That would be good advice if you were
somebody else

RODRICK
(in agony)
I’m sorry women

Rodrick’s bandmates burst into applause He’s mortified

SUSAN
You’re grounded For two weeks

Rodrick shoots a glance at his bandmates They look back at
him like “Are you going to take that” In a last ditch
attempt to save face

RODRICK
Okay settle down I think one week
is plenty
Greg can’t believe Rodrick said that -- this is going better

than he ever dreamed
SUSAN
Make it four weeks And I’m going to
need the keys to your van

All the blood drains from Rodrick’s face

RODRICK
(a mortal blow)
My van
SUSAN

Do you have anymore smart comments
Silence from Rodrick

SUSAN (CONTD)
Okay practice is over Rodrick you
can go to your room

Rodrick can’t even look his bandmates in the eye as they file
out Susan grabs Manny from Greg and marches up the stairs
behind them As Rodrick sullenly heads out he glances at
Greg who looks back at him perhaps a little too innocently
Rodrick mouths the words “YOU’RE SO DEAD” at Greg as he
passes

Greg watches him exit elated He throws his fists into the
air in victory

GREG
Yes

He looks around but realizes there’s no one there to share
the moment His face falls his arms slowly drop to his
sides He’s all alone

INT SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT 188

The gym is dark lit only by a disco ball It’s about half
full of parents and kids There is a DJ spinning records but
nobody dances In fact everybody seems pretty uncomfortable
and awkward Greg and Susan enter Greg looks grim dressed
in a suit jacket and slacks Susan is dressed up seems
excited Greg looks around and sees lots of kids from his
class He passes Archie Kelly who is being hassled by
Quentin and his friend ARTHUR

QUENTIN
Hey Bubby

ARTHUR
Where’s your bubby now Bubby

They laugh Greg nervously puts some distance between him
and Archie

SUSAN
Look at this place Wow it’s like a
real disco Want to dance

GREG
(aghast)
God no

Just then Rowley and Collin enter with THEIR MOMS They
look like they’re having a great time Susan watches Greg
who watches Rowley

SUSAN

when somebody’s worth it you just
have to put yourself out there

SUSAN

But she’s really pleased Greg is taking her advice Greg
sees Rowley is at the refreshments table getting punch He
takes a deep breath and crosses to him

GREG

to get a better look

MUSIC CUE “Groove Is In The Heart” by Deee-lite

ROWLEY LEADS HIS MOM ONTO THE EMPTY DANCE FLOOR AND THEY
START TO DANCE But they don’t just dance They doa
routine that they have clearly practised many times -- it’s
right out of “Dancing With The Stars” The crowd watches
mouths agape Greg is horrified

GREG (V0O)
I couldn’t believe what I was seeing
This is just the kind of thing I could
have saved Rowley from doing if we
were still friends But now this fool
was about to get himself killed

BUT THE CROWD STARTS TO GET INTO IT A group of people
surrounds Rowley and his mom clapping and cheering them on
Other people start streaming onto the dance floor and
dancing The party is kicked into high gear

Rowley is now part of a whole group of kids including
Shelly Marley and Collin who are trying to learn his dance
Greg does not know a curse word bad enough to express what
he’s feeling

EXT SPORT COURT - DAY

Greg is on the sport court Rowley crosses to him He has a
somewhat conciliatory air about him

ROWLEY

Hey
Greg senses a thaw in Rowley’s attitude

GREG
Hey

house and I’m having a sleepover so I
need it back

GREG

GREG
You wouldn’t even have that game if I
hadn’t told you about it You
wouldn’t have half the stuff you have
without me

ROWLEY
Yeah like a broken hand

GREG
That was a million years ago

Greg and Rowley are now shouting at each other A CROWD
INCLUDING PATTY FARRELL STARTS TO GATHER AROUND THEM Greg
and Rowley don’t notice

ROWLEY
It clicks now
(bending wrist)
Hear that Click click click click
And it’s all your fault

GREG

who is nearby on the grass reading a book

shouting kids

It’s clear neither has the faintest idea how to fight Angie
joins the crowd as Greg and Rowley start to half-heartedly
circle each other

Just then there is a loud SQUEAL OF BRAKES

THE TEENS’ PICKUP TRUCK HAS PULLED UP AT THE CURB Pete
Chris Carter and Wade hop out and head toward Greg and
Rowley

THE CROWD SCATTERS AND RUNS BACK INTO THE SCHOOL Angie
finds a spot behind a tree and looks on

Greg and Rowley start to run but the teens are too fast and
grab them

EXT SPORT COURT - DAY 190

Greg and Rowley are being held by Wade and Carter as Pete
paces in front of them

PETE
I waited a long time for this

CHRIS
Youre so freakin’ dead

Greg doesn’t love what they’re saying But he’s really
freaked out by the fact that THE CHEESE IS ONLY A FEW FEET
AWAY In fact as Pete paces he’s walking right by it

PETE
You have no idea what we’re going to
do to you

CHRIS
Oh yeah

Rowley following Greg’s eye line now sees the cheese and
visibly blanches Neither Greg nor Rowley can keep their
eyes off it

Chris pulls Pete aside

CHRIS (CONTD)

PETE (CONTD)

ROWLEY

But --

PETE

Rowley reluctantly picks up the cheese He holds it by the
tips of his fingers totally grossed out

PETE
Now eat it

Rowley’s eyes widen in horror He starts to bring the cheese
closer to his mouth

CLOSE ON GREG Greg winces closing his eyes to block out
the horror of what he is seeing

GREG (VO)
I don’t even want to say exactly what
happened because if Rowley ever tries
to run for President and someone finds
out what these guys made him do he
won’t have a chance So I’ll just put
it this way They made Rowley BLANK
the cheese

Angie covers her eyes aghast
Pete looks over at Greg

PETE
Now you

Wade hustles Greg toward the cheese Greg fights him the
whole way

COACH MALONE (0S)
Hey What are you doing on school
property

The teens Greg and Rowley turn to see Coach Malone running
toward the sport court Behind him the kids from before
trickle out of the school and cautiously begin to follow

Greg turns quickly to Rowley who is so traumatized by eating
the cheese he seems to be having an out-of-body experience

COACH MALONE (CONTD)
Pete Hosey is that you

THE TEENS RUN TO THEIR TRUCK JUMP IN AND PEEL OUT With a
satisfied nod Coach Malone hitches up his shorts and heads
back inside The rest of the kids regather around Greg and
Rowley including Angie

MARLEY
What happened

BRYCE
What’d they want

SHELLY
What’d they do to you

Greg looks at Rowley who seems to be recovering slightly
Patty is near Rowley She looks down at the place where the
cheese used to be and sees that it’s gone THERE IS A FADED
OUTLINE OF WHERE THE CHEESE WAS She looks around and sees
the cheese at Rowley’s feet WITH A BIT OUT OF IT

PATTY
Oh My God

Everyone falls silent As one they all look down at the
cheese Then they all look at Rowley Rowley locks eyes
with Greg It’s all too much for him his eyes well up with
tears

PATTY
(to crowd)

At that moment Greg steps forward and picks up the cheese
THE CROWD GASPS

people I just did you all a huge

Greg holds the cheese high gathering steam

I ate the cheese to show everyone how
stupid this whole school is The
wrong friends the wrong lunch table
the wrong butt it’s all meaningless
just like this cheese Anyone else

join me

Greg surveys the crowd confidently

gives Greg an approving look
