CUT TO
Scene 1 reprise
EXT SUMMER MEADOW - DAY

A young girl runs through a summer meadow with a pair
of
Russian Army field binoculars around her neck

YURI (VO)
I would run around with them taking
pictures of things I liked with my
mind If I saw something beautiful I
would take a picture

With the binoculars pressed to her face she spies

butterflies birds a rabbit She stops running and
aims the

binoculars up up into the sun

INT JOHNS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Yuri translates

YURI
The day before I left Russia my father
gave me the old binoculars He said
that when I saw you I was to stand
far away and look at you with these
and to examine your face closely
And if you were a bad person I could
run away
Nadia looks at the table

YURI
She says she took a picture

John watches Nadia looking at the table She glances up

once

and catches his eye

Alexei suddenly slams his hand down on the table He
raises

his palm There is an ant squashed there He shows
Yuri

EXT JOHNS GARDEN - NIGHT

The small party has moved outside to the patio where
they

sit around a low wooden table in the mellow
candlelight A

huge late Summer moon hangs over the fields Alexei
tinkles

beautifully on his guitar

He stops asks a question in Russian

JOHN
What was that

YURI
Oh nothing

JOHN
Tell me

YURI

No It is too judgmental

JOHN
Tell me what he said

YURI
He says why did you send to Russia

for a wife

Silence John suddenly looks sick
YURI
You are not ashamed of it Its no
surprise to want to love

JOHN
No Its not that

YURI
Do you believe in love

JOHN

terms
YURI

ts very strange How many people
are truly themselves with their love
t is the greatest human disaster
and it is never in the newspapers
There are no Marches Against
Heartache no Ministries Against
Loneliness no Concerts Against
Disappointment We look away And
still we know in secret that nothing
is more important to us The one
thing we all share but dont say
Look John I will show you something

He takes a plate and starts reaching for the food

YURI
Here look something beautiful from
Russia Here is Life there take
it

John accepts the plate

YURI
Here is bread Khylep This is work
We all need this here eat

John eats
