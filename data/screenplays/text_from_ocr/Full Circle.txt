Asian-style elevator music plays on a radio near the cook

inside

Tom tears into his Sushi

enjoying the food

TOSHIRO
I haven’t savored food in over
fourteen hundred years

TOM
You can taste this as I eat it

Toshiro opens his eyes

TOSHIRO
I see what you see Feel what you
feel I know your memories Your
thoughts if I choose

TOM
Okay prove it Tell me something
about myself Something no one
else knows

TOSHIRO

As a child your parents forced you

to paint to make them rich

Toshiro’s eyes are closed

TOM
Okay I believe you

TOSHIRO
But as you grew older you began to
resent them for denying you the
same freedoms others allowed their
children And after a while you
felt that every time they asked you
to paint they were taking a little
piece of your soul

TOM
That’s enough I asked for
something Not an AandE Biography

TOSHIRO
So when you told your parents you
would no longer use your gift for
their profit they betrayed you
shut you out and kept everything
you ever earned for themselves

Tom furious trembles

TOM
Did you hear me I said enough

TOSHIRO
You demanded proof

TOM
Yeah well I changed my mind

The Japanese Chef and the Dishwasher see Tom talking to
himself and give each other a suspicious look

CHEF
(in Japanese)
I think this guy’s talking to his
imaginary friend

The Chef and Dishwasher laugh Tom faces them aggravated
TOM
(in Japanese)

TOM

I’m killing anyone you Iza crazy

Tom hurries across the street Toshiro follows paying no
mind as cars PASS THROUGH him

TOSHIRO
The spirit of a dangerous man was
also imprisoned in that stone along
with me We must not allow him to
escape as I did

TOM
That’s not my problem

TOSHIRO
If Izanagi is freed the loss of
life would be catastrophic We
have to retrieve the stone

TOM
That would require going back to
the warehouse And since I was
fired I could get in a lot of
trouble

TOSHIRO
Your concerns are trivial by
comparison

TOM
But they’re my concerns And it’s
my ass on the line So why don’t
you just go bother someone else

TOSHIRO
I could make you do it

Tom stops in his tracks faces Toshiro

TOM
Then do it Make me

Japanese believed that certain
stones and amulets were capable of
various powers Like resurrecting
the dead or imprisoning souls

CHARLES
I’ve never heard that before

GEMMA
Ive had it since I was eight It
was the last thing my parents sent
me before they went missing

CHARLES
What happened if you don’t mind me
asking

GEMMA
It’s okay Feels like a lifetime
ago They were treasure hunters
Very dangerous work On a dig in
the Koga Mountains and they
vanished Never heard from again
Since then my Uncle raised me He
told me about how my parents always
wanted to show the world some of
our lost culture I guess that’s
why I’ve been putting this exhibit
together for so long I suppose
in a way it makes me feel closer
to them At the very least they
died doing what they loved

CHARLES
Some risks are worth taking

it now
