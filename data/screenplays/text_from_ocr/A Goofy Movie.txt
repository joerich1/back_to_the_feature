TITLE SCREEN

A Movie appears in a formal typeface while a bold fanfare
plays in the background suddenly the characteristic red
polygon logo appears and the letters GOOFY fly on the screen
knocking the formal title askew and accompanied by the
trademark Goofy scream The orchestra responds with a soft
condescending chord

EXT WHEAT FIELD

The movie logo scrolls upward off the blue background and
soft clouds follow - smoothing the transition The camera
continues to pan downward until it comes to rest on a vast
golden wheat field The wheat is blowing gently in a wind
The orchestra continues with soft majestic music that fits
the wheat field scenery

ROXANNE (V0O)
Ma-ax

MAX pops into view very close to the camera looking
disoriented

MAX
Huh

ROXANNE
Ma-ax

The calls continue and Max looks into the screen squinting
Roxanne appears in the distance sitting on a pillar Max
begins pushing his way through the wheat making his way to
Roxanne

Finally he emerges in a clearing beneath the pedestal Roxanne
is sitting on

MAX
Roxanne

She turns to him and blows on the dandelion she is holding
and they brush against Maxs face Max chuckles She jumps
off the pedestal and floats gracefully down toward Max He
reaches out to catch her but loses his balance and both
tumble lightly to the ground They lie on the ground briefly
watching the clouds and laughing Then turning to each other
they exchange meaningful glances Slowly as the music builds
to a climax they draw closer to kiss but just as they are
about to Roxanne recoils in fear The background changes
from a pristine wheat field to a nightmarish tangle of thorns
and the music changes accordingly
MAX
(surprised)
What

Max looks down to find that his two front teeth have become
huge Max stiffens and watches in horror as his feet grow
equally huge bursting through his shoes Roxanne backs away
terrified Standing Maxs hands burst through his gloves
finger by finger growing large and exaggerated Maxs entire
body grows dwarfing Roxanne and the surrounding landscape
His face changes stretching and flattening similar to
Goofys Finally the music builds and the camera pulls back
to reveal Max now looking exactly like Goofy standing in
the remains of his torn clothing Max grabs his throat but
is unable to stifle a harsh terrible Goofy-laugh as the
music peaks

INT MAXS BEDROOM

The music ends abruptly as Max wakes up screaming and sits
up straight in bed He gasps repeatedly but slowly calms
down He feels his teeth with his fingers then sighs in
relief Just as he starts to relax the phone rings loudly -
startling him He grabs the phone and fumbles it dropping
the receiver to the floor He dives after it and answers it
at floor level

MAX
Hello
(clearing throat and
repeating)

Hello
PJ
Max Where the heck are you man
MAX
PJ
PJ
You should have been here an hour
ago
MAX

What Hold on
(whacks clock which
reveals actual time)
Oh no

Max leaps from bed leaving the receiver on the nightstand
He grabs his pants from the back of a chair and attempts to
put them on quickly
PJ
(from receiver on
nightstand)
Look maybe we should just call the
whole thing off

Max struggles with his pants and grabs the receiver

MAX
No way man Its now or neverwhoa

PJ
Well youd better get a move onI1l
meet you at my locker

Max hangs up the phone and his pants fall to the floor
Suddenly Goofy bursts in the door wrapped in a towel with
another on his head

GOOFY
Mornin son
MAX

(embarrassed)
Dad

Max reaches down and pulls his pants up in a huff

GOOFY
Oops SorryI forgot

Goofy backs out of the room and closes the door behind him
Immediately he knocks on the door and without waiting for an
answer opens it again and repeats

GOOFY
Mornin soncame to see if you
had anydirtyclothes

Max is running around the room trying to gather his things
as quickly as possible The room is cluttered with clothes
and various items scattered everywhere

MAX
Ohthere they are help yourself

GOOFY
(looking disdainfully
at the mess)
Max I thought we talked about this

MAX
Look Im sorry Dad Ill take care
of it later
GOOFY
Whats the big rush

MAX
Im running late

GOOFY
Well I can drop you off on the way
to work

MAX
Thats okay Dad II need the
exercise

Max pulls his shirt over his head and continues grabbing
his things Goofy begins vacuuming the floor of Maxs room
sucking up clothes and everything else in his path Max is
about to leave when Goofy accidentally sucks up the head of
Maxs life-size cardboard Powerline cutout Max screams
grabs the figure by its feet and attempts to pull it out
Finally after wrestling with it for a moment Max stomps
the power switch with his foot and the vacuum shuts off -
releasing the figure He stands it up and sees that its head

is bent and its nose is twisted into a curl

MAX
(sadly)
Dad You ruined it

GOOFY
Sorry about thatwho was he
anyway

MAX
(sarcastically)
Its only Powerline Dadthe biggest
rock star on the planet

GOOFY
Ohnot bigger than Xavier Cougat
the mambo king

Goofy grabs Max and starts dancing around the room with Max

flailing to escape

GOOFY
Everybody mambo Mambo mambo
mambo

MAX
DadCome on theres no time for

thisWhat if the neighbors see
us
EXT GOOFYS FRONT YARD

Max escapes and heads out the door leaving Goofy to his big
finish Once outside Goofy clad in his towels catches Max
and hands him a brown paper bag

GOOFY
Maxie wait up You forgot your
lunchhave a good day

To Maxs chagrin Goofy kisses him on the cheek - just as a
group of his classmates skateboard by They laugh at him

Max waves back embarrassed and stomps toward the gate to
leave As he leaves an electric guitar riff begins the After
Today song

MAX
Theyve been laughing since I can
remember but theyre not gonna laugh
anymore No more Maxie the Geek no
more Goof of the week like before

Max gets to the gate at the end of his yard and pushes it
but it wont open

After another unsuccessful attempt he backs up to get a
running start and jumps over the gate Once on the sidewalk
he slips on marbles which some children were playing with
GIRL No more algebra tests till September

Max slipping on the marbles bumps into the girl and her
boyfriend

BOYFRIEND No more lookin at losers like him
Her boyfriend grabs Max and tosses him aside

KID1

at each other and passersby one of them hits Max in the

on skateboards follow them up the street as they walk away

ALL

MAX

Max pops up behind several ladies on bus stop bench startling
them

MAX

TWIN GIRLS

Then down with the textbooks

NERDY KIDS
And up with the comics

Max runs through a flock of pigeons scaring them away
MAX

Just think of all the time Ive been
losin finding the right thing to
MAX

way after today

Max in front of the music store stops and waves at Roxanne
passing by She doesnt see him and continues on Max looks
turns away sadly and looks into the music store and sees
Stacey and another girl looking starstruck at the Powerline
display

MAX
She looked right through me and who
could blame her I need a new me
plus some positive proof that Im
not just a goof and

A school bus passes by with filled with students including
Bobby and some cheerleaders

CHORUS
After today Im gonna be cruisin’

GRUNGE GIRLS
No more pep rallies to cut - bleah

CHORUS
After today my brains will be
snoozin

BUS DRIVER

Im gonna sit on my butt

Everyone piles out of the bus the cheerleaders bouncing all
the way and the grunge girls looking equally disgusted with
the proceeding Max running to class slides down a banister
and bumps into Principal Mazur knocking his toupee askew

MAX
Ive got less than an hour and when
this is ended Ill either be
famous

MAZUR
Or youll be suspended

EXT STADIUM

Max runs into the stadium and onto the track flips over a
hurdle and continues past a group of heavy girls doing
exercises and looking exhausted

ALL
Just think of all the time Ive been
losing waiting until I could say
The graduates in caps and gowns toss their caps in the
air Several kids jump out of cars one of them slamming the
door on the puckered lips of their mother The band and
cheerleaders are practicing formations in the field The
drum major tosses her baton in the air and catches it in her
teeth

ALL
Gonna be on my own kiss the parents
good-bye gonna party from now to
the end of July things will be going
my way after today

Max runs up to the top of the bleachers and enjoys feeling
the wind blowing in his face The school bell rings
attracting everyones attention - the band and cheerleaders
the jockstrap flinging kids Chad and his girlfriend who
were kissing and Max

MAX
I wish that this was the dayafter
today

Just after finishing the line Max starts down the bleachers
and trips He falls flailing and screaming to the bottom

of the bleachers and lands on his face A group of students
including Chad and his girlfriend gather around him laughing
as he reaches to pick up his books The crowd disperses and
Roxanne approaches to help him pick up his books When Max
sees who she is he stands up flabbergasted

ROXANNE
Are you all right

MAX
Yeahyeah Im okay I just -

Max babbles incoherently and Roxanne gives him an
understanding smile Then both start to giggle

MAX
(babbling)
Uhumwell Iah
(chuckles)
-umh-yuk
(Goofy laugh)

Max absolutely mortified with the silly laugh covers his
mouth gasping and starts to back away Roxanne gives him a
curious glance and he turns and runs away Part of the way
to the stadium exit he runs into some garbage cans and trips
Recovering he runs out the exit screaming - leaving Roxanne
standing by herself
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

Now inside the school Max berates himself while walking
down the hall

MAX
I cant believe I did that Arrgh
She finally says hi to me and
what do I do I joke H-yukShe
probably thinks Im a big spazz

Max approaches PJ who is digging through his locker

PJ
Where have you been buddy

MAX
Hi Peejdid you get the camera

PJ Looking very nervous pulls a camcorder out of his locker

PJ
(nervously)
Look Maxif my Dad catches me
with this hell kill me Are you
sure you gotta do this

MAX
Roxanne doesnt even notice mebut
after today

A bright light suddenly envelops them Squinting they look
toward the source and see a cart full of audiovideo
equipment A 1950s style guitar riff plays Bobby standing
beside it is drinking from a fountain through a straw

MAX
Bobby

Max and PJ approach the cart and join Bobby in the room

MAX
Wow This is all for us

BOBBY
(finishing his drink)
Mmmmmslurpage

MAX
Oh this is gonna be great man

Max starts to pull the cart out of the room but Bobby stops
him

BOBBY
Dudeneed fundage bro
MAX
Oh your feeyeah yeahright

Max hands Bobby a brown paper bag which Bobby opens
anxiously

BOBBY
Cheddar Owww
(howling like a wolf)
Cheddar whizzie

Bobby shakes the can up and holding it in the air squirts a
bunch of it into his mouth Max and PJ react with nauseous
looks Bobby stops spraying and starts licking it off of his
lips He coughs and thumps his chest coughing some of the
cheese onto Max and PJ

BOBBY
MmmSprey scumshus Its pretty
scrumptious

Bobby suddenly appearing behind Max and PJ who are trying
to wipe the cheese off of their clothes grabs them both
around the shoulders forcing Max and PJ to smile

BOBBY
Lets do it ladies

INT SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

Stacey stands behind the podium in an auditorium packed with
rowdy students giving them the standard end-of-school
retrospective speech

STACEY
As student body president I just
want to say like yay to all of us
for a really neat year

NERDY KID
(mocking chant)
Yo Stacey Talk to me talk to me
talk to me baby

Stacey shoots the kid a disdainful look

STACEY
And finally I hope you can all attend
my totally amazing end-of-school
party next Saturday to watch the

STACEY
Powerline concert live on pay-per-
view

Everyone cheers loudly

STACEY
Thank you thank you very muchand
now without further adieu Principal
Mazur

The cheering continues as Principal Mazur offstage is fixing
his tie and putting on his biggest smile He walks into the
spotlight which follows him toward the podium Immediately
all the cheering ceases leaving only the sound of crickets
chirping He reaches the podium and begins his speech

MAZUR

Thank you Staceyand Gmorning
boys and girls You know every year
on the last day of school I have
several youngsters approach me and
say Principal Mazur what can we
do to not waste our summer vacation
We dont want to waste our free time
sleeping or visiting friends

Everyone looks at each other and yawns Chad leans forward
in his seat to talk to Roxanne

CHAD
Say uh Roxanneabout Staceys
party

The camera zip-zooms to Max who is backstage and dressed in
a Powerline costume He is poking his head out from behind
the curtain and he sees Chad talking to Roxanne Closing
the curtain he zips up his costume and turns toward Bobby
and PJ

MAX
Are youuhhow are you doin
down there Bobby

Bobby wearing a welders helmet is using an acetylene torch
to connect piles of cables and equipment A video monitor
beside him is flashing a variety of images He lifts the
helmet and shoots Max and PJ a half sarcastic half joking
glance

BOBBY
Dont give me that attitude
guysIm doing it all for you

He puts the helmet back on and continues The scene shifts
to PJ who is walking while looking into the camcorders
viewfinder

PJ
(nervously)
This is nuts I dont Know why I let
you guys talk me into this If my
dad finds out hes gonna nuke my
entire existenceaahh

PJ isnt watching where he is going and he trips on some
cables that are lying on the stage He falls alluding to
things to come and briefly appears behind Mazur before the
curtain settles back into position Max grabs him and helps
him up

MAX
I hope this works

On stage Mazur continues his speech The spotlight suddenly
goes out leaving him surprised and in the dark

MAZUR
How about science slumber
parties -- huh

Backstage Max dons his Powerline visor and gives the others
a thumbs up

Bobby at the control panel gives a thumbs up PJ turning
on the camcorder gives a nervous thumbs up Bobby presses a
button and a fast pop-rock beat begins playing The curtain
begins to rise revealing a large video projection screen
Mazur starts to speak but Bobby presses a button backstage -
dropping him through a trapdoor

MAZUR
WhatHeyIm not gonna just -
aaaaaaahhhhhhh

Max in a Powerline pose appears on the screen with an
animated atom behind him and scan lines zipping up and down
the screen The audience gasps and looks pleasantly surprised
Bobby laughs heartily The video display changes colors and
images dynamically as Stand Out begins

The action is still occurring on the video monitor as special
effects footage of Max with PJ running the camera

MAX
(lLip-synching Powerline)
Some people settle for the typical
things living all their lives waiting
in the wings It aint a question of

MAX
if just a matter of time before I
move to the front of the line Once
youre watching every move that I
make youre gonna believe that I
got what it takes to stand out above
the crowd even if I gotta shout out
loud Til mine is the only face
youll see gonna stand out till you
notice me

The scene changes to reveal the audiences positive reactions
including Roxannes The camera angle rotates around PJ and
through his legs as he continues to film Max Max gets caught
in the cables lying on the floor and trips He falls
screaming and rips through the screen rolling out onto the
stage and leaving the monitor displaying static He stands

up and is motionless for a moment as he looks at the crowd

in the auditorium The image of the crowd is reflected off

of his visor as he looks nervously around the room He looks
at PJ and Bobby who are standing offstage they laugh and
give him the thumbs-up Max looks back toward the crowd

and the reflection on his visor pans from the image of Bobby
and PJ to Roxanne - who is shyly smiling at the unknown
performer Reassured Max heads straight for her

Bobby offstage decides to provide some visual flair by
spraying a foggy mist onto the stage

BOBBY
A little smok-age Owww
(howling like a wolf)

Max strides across the stage moonwalking

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)

POWERLINE
(spoken)
If I could make you stop and take a
look at me instead of just

POWERLINE WITH CHORUS
Walkin by

He Lip-synchs the following lines directly to Roxanne Her
face reflects off Maxs visor

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)

POWERLINE
(spoken)
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do
if it was getting you to notice

POWERLINE WITH CHORUS
Im alive

PJ crawls onstage hidden by the smoke and hooks Max onto a
cable

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)
All I need is every chance a second
thought a second glance to prove I
got whatever it takes
(spoken)
Its a piece of cake

Bobby and PJ lift Max off the stage and he flies around the
auditorium during the following chorus much to everyones
excitement

CHADS GIRLFRIEND
Whos that guy

He grabs a basketball from a tall kid and dunks it in the
basket as he flies by

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)
To stand out above the crowd even
if I gotta shout out loud Til mine
is the only face youll see gonna
stand out

Max flies toward Roxanne who is waiting with an outstretched
hand They almost touch but the cable hes on stops short
pulling him backwards into spin as the music slows down and
stops He swings toward a disgruntled Principal Mazur who
stops him and takes off his visor

OFFSCREEN KID
Its the Goof boy

ALL
(gasps)
Everyone looks in shock at Max except
Roxanne who smiles appreciatively

Bobby (with PJ in sort of a headlock) still offstage realize
their fate

BOBBY
Were bust-ed

INT PHOTO CENTER IN DEPARTMENT STORE

The scene changes with a camera flash to a close up of Goofy
making a funny face and squeezing a rubber ducky The angle
changes and we see a small bald baby on the verge of tears
She is being photographed by Goofy who is attempting to get
her to smile

GOOFY

Goofy squeezes a rubber ducky making the typical squeaky
noise in an attempt to get her to smile As he squeezes it
the squeaker pops out of the toy and into his mouth - getting
caught in his throat Gasping Goofy makes the squeaky noise
repeatedly This amuses the little girl and she begins laugh-
ing Seeing his chance Goofy steps behind the camera and
takes the picture of the little girl - with the red-eye glow
intact As he continues Pete enters the scene Goofy makes
the squeaky sound which annoys Pete Goofy looks at him and
makes an inquisitive-sounding squeak

PETE
Stop goofin around

Pete slaps Goofy on the back of the head dislodging the
squeaker Finished Goofy picks up the little girl and returns
her to her mother - continually making baby noises to amuse
the child

roughly

INT PRINCIPAL MAZURS OFFICE

With a loud crash reminiscent of a jail door slamming the
scene shifts to an overhead view of Max and Bobby waiting in
the Principals office Miss Maples the secretary sits
across the room from them typing and humming the Hungarian
death march Max is looking terrified and Bobby is slouching
across the chairs - facing the wall

MAX
Im a failure a complete losermy
one chance to impress Roxanne and I
blew it

After a few moments Bobby mumbles and turns to Max holding
a small sculpture made of squeeze cheese

BOBBY
HmmMax lookits the leaning
tower of cheese-a

He squishes the entire creation into his mouth messily and
eats it After a moment PJ emerges looking shell-shocked

PJ

Bobby hands Max the can of squeeze cheese and pushes a
cartload of audio video equipment into Mazurs office while
his signature guitar music plays in the background

BOBBY
(confidently)
Hey Ma-za-ur Whats up bro

Bobby begins talking to Mazur and shuts the door Max puts
his head in his hands and sits motionlessly Roxanne and
Stacey enter the room with Stacey chattering at a fast pace
They approach the desk to get some papers

STACEY

Roxanne notices Max sitting on the chair and she gazes at

She pushes Roxanne toward Max

ROXANNE

Roxanne walks over toward Max but with his head down he
doesnt notice her

She clears her throat several times but to no avail

ROXANNE
Ahem Ahem

She turns back to Stacey and gives her a “now what glance
Stacey motions her to continue

STACEY
Tap him

Roxanne approaches Max and taps him on the shoulder

Startled Max quickly sits upright and knocks Roxannes books
to the floor Realizing what hes done he begins apologizing
as she begins to gather them

MAX
Gosh Im sorry

ROXANNE

He bends down to help her and they simultaneously reach for
the same book and touch each others hands accidentally Max
pulls his away embarrassed

Roxanne backs away slowly shyly and backs into the wall
beside the office door After leaving she walks down the
hall with Stacey

Back in the principals office Max waves shyly at Roxanne
as she leaves then jumps up in the air and begins yelling

Max begins dancing around the room out of sheer joy with
mambo music playing in the background

After several moments he grabs Miss Maples and involves her

smiles and encourages Max

Goofy sits shellshocked in the chair for a moment Suddenly
a bright blue light illuminates him and pans across the room -
accompanied by an announcement on the PA system

Goofy rises slowly and walks toward the rotating blue beam
of light It crosses his face repeatedly and scans across
the room Goofy approaches the sale table On the table is
an assortment of small childrens toys that look like a boy

Goofys face brightens as he gets an idea

EXT FRONT OF SCHOOL

Everything is absolutely still in a wide shot of the schools
front doors Suddenly the school bell rings and the doors
explode open and crowds of students pile out at high speed
Among them is Bobby and a number of recurring characters

the focus is on Max as he walks away from the school A number
of people approach him including some who had ridiculed him
earlier

KID 1

Max incredulous continues to take it all in Chads
girlfriend approaches him but Stacey quickly shoves her

Max strains against the load as PJ compliments him on the

till mine is the only face youll
see gonna stand out so youll notice
me

Max moonwalks past the bus stop ladies seen in After Today
spins around the bus stop sign and jumps - slapping the leaves
in a nearby tree En route home he runs through a number of
yards Max runs under kids on a swingset then swings from
their tire He flies over a sunbather and bounces off her
diving board landing on a Slip “n Slide and grabbing a
skateboard He skateboards over over a fence then through a
construction site doing loops inside a large pipe He exits
the pipe and Lands on a truck labeled Starving House Pets
Moving and Storage He skates off the truck under the sofa
being moved and directly into the houses kitchen He zips

by a baby and grabs its fork He dismounts the skateboard

and somersaults across the street to his house as the music
fades and finishes He enters the gate to his yard and passes
Goofy - who is packing the car for a trip

EXT GOOFYS FRONT YARD

MAX

month drop me a line

GOOFY
But Max this isnt just MY
vacationits a vacation with me

MAX
Oh Donald Duck

GOOFY
No silly With you

The camera does a zip-zoom toward Max centering on his
shocked face He collapses falling backwards Fading from
black we see an upward-looking view of Goofy coming into
focus He slaps Maxs face lightly to rouse him

GOOFY
Are you okay Maxie

MAX
Wha-what did you say

GOOFY
Thats right A vacation son Well

Goofy picks him up and hugs him

MAX
I think Im gonna be sick

GOOFY
Hey got a present for ya

MAX
NoDadStopWhat are you-

Goofy grabs Max After a flurry of hands flying clothes

and protests from Max Goofy steps back to reveal Max dressed
in an fishing hat hip waders and an inflatable vest After

a beat Goofys hand appears and pulls the string on the
vest As the camera pulls back quickly the vest inflates
rapidly - puffing up to full size - leaving Max looking like
a large balloon Goofy looks at him pleased with the gifts

GOOFY
You look just like I did at your
age

MAX
(exasperated)
Please dont say that Dad

GOOFY
Wait I saved the best for last

Goofy produces a dusty old rectangular box He blows clouds
of dust off the surface

GOOFY
Its been handed down from goof to
goof to goof and nowits yours
son

Goofy opens the box to reveal an old fishing rod inside

MAX
A stick

GOOFY
No silly a fishin pole

Goofy twirls the line in the air

MAX
Fishing Were going FISHING

GOOFY
Yep just like my Dad and me didtwo
best buddies fishing on Lake
Destinyaway from it all

Goofy walks toward the car

MAX
I dont wanna be “away from it all
DadI LIKE it all

GOOFY

Hey look Maxiewere usin the
Same map me and my Dad used Well
take the same route make the same
stops see the same sights

Enchanted majestic-sounding music begins playing as Goofy
opens an old dusty map and spreads it across the hood of

the car Max still puffed up waddles over The map has a
tangle of criss-crossing looping wild lines drawn on
iteventually leading to Lake Destiny Idaho At the bottom
is a list of names ending with Walter Goofy and Benjamin
Goofy which are both crossed out and beneath them is
scrawled All Goofs Max is shocked

MAX
Agh But that trip would take WEEKS
Dad

GOOFY
Exactly Gettin theres half the
fun

Max pushes the map aside

MAX
Put the map away Dadits not
gonna happen

GOOFY
Careful son Youll wrinkle my
pastand our future
(mysteriously)
What the map says Max we will
follow

MAX
Thats verymystical and

GOOFY

Awwthere will be plenty of time
for parties when youre older
Maxiewhy when I was your age
Id never even been invited to a
party and look at me now

Goofy strikes a proud pose

MAX
(sarcastically)
Great Dad

Goofy opens the car door in hopes of persuading Max to get
in

GOOFY
Hop in Maxie

Max shuts the door

MAX
No

Goofy is uncertain how to proceed He thinks a moment and
his face brightens with an idea He then frowns sadly and
proceeds to try to make Max feel guilty

GOOFY
Oh all right thenguess Ill
just have to go - all alone thats
alljust sit in the boat - all
aloneand talk to myself - all

alone
MAX
(unmoved)
I guess so
GOOFY

Oh come on Hop in

Goofy opens the car door again hoping to persuade him Max
refuses repeatedly and shuts the door each time Goofy opens
it

MAX
No Dad

GOOFY

Just hop right in there
MAX

No
GOOFY

Come on Maxiego for it

At this point Goofy is out of ideas completely frustrated
He grabs Max who is still immobile in the inflatable vest
and shoves them into the car He ties him down with the
seatbelt accompanied by a barrage of protests from Max

GOOFY
Were ready for takeoff

Goofy shuts Max in as he struggles with the restraints runs
around the car and gets in the drivers side He gets ready
to start the car

GOOFY
Set for adventure Maxie

MAX
(exasperated)
Why are you DOING this to me Dad

GOOFY
(frightened)
‘Cause I dont want you to end up in
the electric chair

MAX
Electric chair What are you-

GOOFY

sontogether were gonna work this
out

MAX
Work this out But Dad

GOOFY
No buts about it Maxie boyyour
old pop knows best

MAX
But

Max is speechless As Goofy starts the car to leave he
resigns himself to the situation He looks gloomily at the
fishing pole

EXT SUBURBAN STREET

Goofy backs out of the driveway and runs over part of his
fence crushing it

GOOFY
Gbye housegbye mailboxgbye
pile of broken wood

They head down the road and are only several blocks from
their house when Max remembers his date with Roxanne

MAX
Good-bye hopes good-bye dreams
good-bye RoxanneRoxanne
(agitated)
Dad Ive got to stop somewhere first
I have to talk to someone

GOOFY
Well

Max grabs the wheel of the car turning it to the right The
car careens around the turn leaning sideways Bouncing off

of other vehicles and severing a fire hydrant the car finally
pulls to the side of the road Max gets out and heads up the
walkway in Roxannes front yard

EXT ROXANNES PORCH

GOOFY
Now make it quick Maxie boyweve
got to put some road behind us

Max mutters to himself frustrated

MAX
You get to cancel your first date in
less than an hourmust be some
kind of lLame-o record

Max arrives at the front door and rings the bell After a
short pause a large hulking man appears in the door in an
undershirt and boxer shorts He grunts Frightened Max takes
a step backwards

MAX
(nervously)
H-hiIs Roxanne home My name is
Max

The large man grunts angrily at Max
MAX
Does Roxanne live hereDoes she
even live on this block

Max starts to leave when Roxanne appears in the door beside
the man

ROXANNE
Wait Its okay Daddy Max is a
friend from school Go on go

(embarrassed)
Hey Max

Roxanne looks embarrassed and ushers her father back into
the house

MAX
(incoherent)
He-uhhuh

ROXANNE
(nervously)
Do you uh want to have a seat

Max and Roxanne walk to the other side of the porch to talk
Once there Max lifts Roxanne onto the banister by her hips

Her father watching through the mail slot grunts angrily
at them This startles Max and he quickly puts his hands
behind his back and grins innocently Roxanne chides her
father

ROXANNE
(angrily)
Daddy

Once he leaves Max hops onto the banister beside Roxanne
and they continue their conversation

ROXANNE
I promise hell be better behaved
when you pick me up for the party

MAX
Yeah thats uh sorta why I came
by
ROXANNE

MAX

ROXANNE

MAX
(shocked)

ROXANNE

Roxanne begins walking toward her front door to go inside
She is almost to the door and Max panics He doesnt want
Roxanne to go to the party with someone else so he blurts
out a lie

MAX
UmuhRoxannemy Dad

(interrupting)

Powerline for the final number

ROXANNE

MAX
Well I wouldnt miss our date for
anything that wasnt incredible
Roxanne

Roxanne kisses Max on the cheek He stumbles backward then
starts to walk toward the car

ROXANNE
Have a great time at the concert
Max

Max mumbles something still dazed and stumbles slowly toward
the car He is almost there when Roxanne shouts from here
porch

ROXANNE
Ill see you on TV

The gravity of his situation hits him and he quickly sobers
up

MAX
(to himself)
Im in deep sludge

Max gets in the car and hangs his head out the window Goofy
starts the car and drives away

EXT HIGHWAY

The heavy music of the previous scene segues to a cheerful
bouncy tune and we see Goofys car zipping along a highway
among other cars Then the view changes to that of a camcorder
viewfinder jerkily panning around the interior of the car

and toward Max as Goofy begins his vacation video

GOOFY
Day One Well here we are out on
the open road retracing the steps
of my boyhoodand heeeeeres
MaxieA-hyukSay hi Max

Goofy pans the camera toward Max who is looking sadly out
the window When prompted Max looks briefly at the camera
then quickly turns away

GOOFY
Well how about a wave

Max puts his hand over the lens but Goofy remains undaunted

MAX
(irritated)
Not now Dad

GOOFY

Goofy looks at Max thoughtfully and begins to get frustrated
when he comes up with an idea He checks his pockets and
finds a hastily scrawled list of games that he had played
with his father as a child Some of the items include story
telling road bingo twenty questions and simon says He
begins to read the list and excitedly asks Max to play when
he picks one

GOOFY
Fun games I used to play with my
Dadroad bingotwenty que- oh
Hey Maxie uh lets play a game
You think of a name and Ill try to
guess who it is Uh man or woman

MAX
(unenthusiastically)
Man

GOOFY
Man Hmmmthats a toughieWalt
Disney

MAX
Right

GOOFY

Ooh Im good at thisnow uh
Ill think of onehmmm

Goofys thought is interrupted but loud and raucous rock
guitar music

Surprised he looks at Max who is busy playing air guitar
with his hands and listening to the music

GOOFY
(shouting over the
music)
Oh You want to sing a song huh Me
and my Dad used to sing this one all
the time

Goofy grabs an eight-track cassette from his rack puts it
in the cars tape deck starts it playing and sings (poorly)
along with it Max looks at Goofy in disbelief

RECORDED MUSIC AND GOOFY
(song High Hopes)
High hopes hes got high hopes
hes got high apple pie in the sky
hopes -

Max having heard enough turns back to the radio and
continues his air guitar playing - interrupting Goofys song
After several moments Goofy turns the tape back on and
continues singingangering Max

RECORDED MUSIC AND GOOFY
oops there goes another rubber tree -

Max turns his music back on followed by Goofy playing his
Their conflict escalates and they switch songs faster and
faster both getting continually angrier

RECORDED MUSIC AND GOOFY
00ps there goes ano-oops there
goes-00psoops

Finally they both jam their buttons simultaneously and the
stereo mangles the tape then blows up in a puff of smoke

MAX
(angrily)
Oh great Dadnow we dont have
ANY music
GOOFY

Oh Maxieits not so bad Well
just have to entertain ourselves

Max sighs and resumes looking out the window Goofy begins

to get frustrated as they sit in silence with cars passing
quietly He looks around for something to do then notices
the car keys rattling against his Disney logo keychain in an
interesting rhythm He looks in the side-view mirror and

sees that the tailpipe has joined in - puffing and backfiring
in time Some rattling pots and pans in their luggage
contribute and Goofy begins whistling

Max looks at him bored as they merge onto the highway -
passing a sign labeled Open Road - and Goofy begins the
Open Road song

Trying to liven him up Goofy playfully pokes at Max musses
up his hair and grabs him in a hug-like hold - but he doesnt
pay attention to where hes going and the car swerves wildly

GOOFY
Do you need a break from modern
livin Do you long to shed your
weary load If your nerves are raw
and your brain is fried just grab a
friend and take a ride together upon
the open road

Max pries Goofys arms off his neck and returns to his
original position exasperated

MAX
All in all Id rather have detention
All in all Id rather eat a toad

GOOFY
Yuck

Goofy nearly hits a tractor-trailer then zips across lanes
of traffic He hits the guard rail sending out a shower of
sparks and setting the car on two wheels While partially
airborne Maxs side of the car passes over a motorcycle
with sidecar They then get back on course as they pass rows
of smoking factories

MAX
And the old man drives like such a
klutz that Im about to hurl my
guts directly upon the open road

GOOFY
Theres nothin can upset me cause
now were on our way Our trusty map
will guide us straight and true

Now passing oil rigs Goofy begins reading the map and
steering with his feet Max looks into the clouds and imagines
one is Roxanne His vision is interrupted as Goofy begins
running over construction cones and head straight for a
construction scaffold Max screams and covers his eyes as

they plow into the lower rungs of the scaffold and knock it
over Goofy doesnt notice anything He puts the map away

and continues driving

MAX
Roxanne please dont forget me I
will return someday though I may be
in traction when I do

GOOFY
Me and Max relaxing like the old
days
MAX
This is worse than dragon breath and
acne
GOOFY
In a buddy-buddy kind of mode
MAX
Im so mad I think I may explode
GOOFY
When I see that highway I could
cry
MAX

Yknow thats funny - so could I

GOOFY AND MAX
Just being out on the open road

As they pass a pickup truck Goofy notices that it is carrying
aman playing a piano Three country singers pop out of the
piano and sing

COUNTRY SINGERS
Howdy boys is this the way to
Nashville

Goofy waves to the singers but nearly hits a tow truck The
driver blows the horn at him

TOW TRUCK DRIVER
Watch it Mack or youll be gettin
towed

A prison transport carrying a prisoner in stripes and chains
Goofy looks worried and imagines Max in the same outfit He
quickly accelerates to pass the transport

PRISONER
Im in no hurry to arrive cause
Ill be turning sixty-five the next
time I see the open road

Goofy and Max approach a small convertible with a small driver
and his huge wife

MAN

Just a week of rest and relaxation
WIFE

Yeah
MAN

And the odd romantic episode

MAX
Very odd

Off to the side of the road we see Mickey Mouse and Donald
Duck with backpacks and luggage Donald looks angry

MICKEY MOUSE
And its Californ-i-a or bust

An old lady driving in a brightly painted sports car full of
cats begins driving wildly past Goofy and Max swerving
through lanes of traffic

OLD WOMAN
Look out you dirt bags eat my
dustfrom now on Im on the open

road

GOOFY
Its me and little Maxie my pipsqueak
pioneer

A woody station wagon full of nuns passes

NUNS
Theyre partners forever westward ho -
YEE HAW

On the other side a Limousine passes with a glitter-gloved
hand poking out the moonroof

MAX
Could someone call a taxi and get me
out of hereto Beverly Hills 90210

A variety of vehicles surround them Some include a fire

truck covered with firemen a convertible driven by a bride
while the groom parachutes in a zoo transport wagon a flower
truck a balloon truck a gangster car with a person tied up
in the trunk a hearse with a singing corpse coming out of

the coffin in the back

ALL
Everyday another new adventure
every mile another new zip codeand
the cares we had

CORPSE
Are gone for good

MAX
And Id go with them if I could

The other cars are joined by a motorcycle a tractor trailer
and others Many of the riders are now dancing on the roofs
of their vehicles including the corpse the nuns the

firemen and several wingwalkers on a biplane that flies by

ALL
Ive got no strings on me Im feeling
fancy free how wonderful to beon
the open road

Goofys car now alone zips under a bridge and Knocks off
some of its luggage as they disappear into the sunset The
scene changes to the next day They are still driving ona
rural interstate Goofy is again reading the map while
driving and he slowly edges into the oncoming lane Max
not paying attention suddenly realizes what is happening
when he hears a horn blaring

At first he is too petrified to speak or move but at the
last minute he screams and grabs the wheel swerving the car
into its own lane - and barely avoiding a collision with a
tractor-trailer

GOOFY
a break from modern livindoo
doo dum dumgrab a friend

MAX
AAHHDad Youre gonna get us

KILLED (gasp) (pant)Why dont

GOOFY
Oh no thanks sonnavigatins a
big responsibility

Max gives him a dirty look

GOOFY
Besides you wouldnt want to spoil
the big surprise Im taking you
someplace pretty special

EXT LESTERS POSSUM PARK PARKING LOT

Twangy country music plays as Goofy pulls into the parking
lot of Lesters Possum Park a run-down tourist trap The
entrance is shaped like a huge possum head with an open mouth
and big teeth A mother is dragging a terrified little girl
into it Max is mortified at the sight of it

GOOFY
Gawrsh its even better than I
remembered

LITTLE GIRL
No Mommy I dont wanna go Wahhhhhh

MAX
Yeah funtell you what Im just
gonna wait right here in the car

GOOFY
A-hyuk Ya party pooper Come on
This is gonna be fun

Goofy grabs Max and drags him out of the car
INT LESTERS POSSUM PARK THEATER

An old man in front of the worn stage curtain introduces the
show to the audience - who are sitting on a variety of broken
benches and other objects

EMCEE
(in an old voice)
Well howdy-there folksLesters
is proud to present the Possum Posse
Jamboreehere it is

The audience applauds enthusiastically Goofy dashes in with
Max moping behind him

GOOFY
Just in time

The curtain opens to reveal a cheaply designed and painted
set and an extraordinarily unimpressive mechanical Lester
which performs the musical number

LESTER
Howdy folks Whos your favorite
possum

AUDIENCE

Lester Lester Lester

Goofy runs back to Max who was lagging behind and grabs
him

GOOFY
Got us a seat right up front

The Lester character introduces the others each of which
pops out of their own hole The Mordicai character fizzles
and sparks before working correctly

LESTER
Let me introduce you to the posse
Heres Beauford Beulah and Mordicai

MORDICAI
Hey Lesterready for yodelin

LESTER
Sure am Beauford

Country music begins playing and the mechanical posse begins
bouncing up and down and playing their instruments

LESTER
Now gather ‘round my possum

“n howl “n holler from the hearth

MAX
This is pathetic

LESTER
And every chicken pig and goatll
help by yelpin out a yodel here at
Lesters Possum Park

ALL
(yodeling)

Max looks down the bench hes on and sees the little girl
that was dragged in earlier She smiles a big toothless
smile at him and he grins sheepishly back
GOOFY
Yodelay-heeyodel-odel-ode-lay

LESTER
Lesters Possum Park

The yodeling continues and the little girls laughs more and
gives Max still bigger toothless smiles Max finds all this

very unnerving He rolls his eyes at Goofy and resigns himself

to pouting

LESTER
Dont you wanna be a hangin from a
tree were mighty glad to see you
and the parkins always free - here
at Lesters po-po-po

The machine gets stuck and the emcee whacks it with his fist
making it finish the show Max puts his head in his hands in
resignation

EXT OUTSIDE POSSUM THEATER

As soon as the show ends the whole crowd explodes out of
the theater Trailing them is Goofy fumbling with his
camcorder He gets it working and points it at the door
ready to film Max He turns around and sees the souvenir
stand He decides to get something for him Max approaches
slowly

GOOFY
Hey Thats the ticketI1l be
right back my Little possum pal

Goofy walks away toward the stand Max is left alone to
mope when a big costume-character approaches

MAX
(sigh)
My lifes a living-

LESTER
Hello Little buddyWhos your
favorite possum

Max doesnt want to be bothered and is not happy to see
him He begins to walk away when the character becomes more
insistent

MAX
(angrily)
Dont TOUCH me

LESTER
Awwwwwhy such a long
faceyoure so sadboo-hooI
know You need a big hug from Lester

Max knows what hes going to do and starts to warn him -
but its too late

Lester grabs him picks him off the ground and squeezes him
tightly This infuriates Max

MAX
Dont even think about -
(grunt)
unhugh

LESTER
Seenow you feel all good inside

Max slaps the character in the face and its head spins around
and faces the wrong way Disoriented he stumbles off into

the background where a group of little kids tackles him to
the ground and drags him away in a swarm

MAX
Beat it doofus

Max watches contentedly smiling to himself as the kids

drag Lester off He turns around to see Goofy coming toward
him with a hat shaped like a road-killed possum Max protests
but Goofy puts the hat on him anyway After this Goofy spies
the photograph stand - which is offering guests pictures
posing beside live possums The little girl seen earlier is
having hers taken and crying loudly

MAX
Oh no no Dad not that Please
GOOFY
Here you go sportWhat say we
get our picture taken
MAX
You have GOT to be kidding
GOOFY
Oh all rightbut youre missing

out

Goofy walks toward the stand to have his picture taken Max
begins to turn away when he hears loud laughter He looks
back in shock

MAX
Ugh

MAX

(sigh)
Huh

Goofy is hanging upside-down with the possums to have his
picture taken much to the amusement of the crowd Much to
Maxs chagrin Goofy yells to him

GOOFY
Hi-ya son

An obnoxious kid standing near Max points at and mocks Goofy

OBNOXIOUS KID
Hey everyone check out the dork

The photographer prepares to take the picture while Goofy
continues to hang

PHOTOGRAPHER
Say sassafrass

GOOFY
Sass-ee-frass

Goofy and the possums pose and smile The photographer takes
the picture but just after the flash fades the branch they
were hanging on falls - catapult- ing one of the possums
through the air Goofy lands on his head while the possum
smacks into Maxs face After looking directly at Max for a
moment the possum decides to hide - in Maxs shirt Max
starts jumping around wildly trying to get rid of the possum
The band takes this as their cue to play dance music and
begins to do so Goofy also thinks Max is dancing and rushes
to join him

MAX
AahhUnhGet outoofGet
it out

GOOFY
Thats the spirit Maxie

Max resolves the situation by pulling his pants down and
extricating the possum Just as he pulls his pants up again
Goofy grabs him by the arm and begins spinning and dancing
him around in a comical country-style dance All Max sees is
a flurry of laughing faces

MAX
DadNoDadDADThis is
embarrassing

The music ends and Goofy props Max up on his knee as a
finale The crowd applauds loudly still laughing Max glares
furiously at all of them

GOOFY
Ta-da A-hyuk

The obnoxious kid pops out of the crowd to make fun of them

OBNOXIOUS KID
Its dork and dork junior Ha ha ha

The crowd continues to laugh loudly Max walks away form
Goofy looks angrily at the people and throws the possum
hat down on the ground in disgust He shoves his way out of
the crowd knocking a laughing kid to the ground in the
process He stomps out of the park and returns to their car

EXT OUTSIDE LESTERS POSSUM PARK

Max attempts to open the cars door but it is locked He
hits the window in frustration Rain begins to fall as he
walks out of the parking lot Goofy emerges from the park
entrance and sees Max leaving Standing along the roadside
and trying to hitchhike a ride a car passes and soaks Max
when it hits a puddle He shakes the water off angrily Goofy
runs toward him

MAX
Aargh

GOOFY
Max Hey what the heckre you tryin
to do

Goofy puts his hand on Maxs shoulder but Max jerks away

MAX
(angrily)
Trying to get away from you

GOOFY
(surprised)
Me W-what did I do

MAX
Forget it

Max walks back toward the car and Goofy follows him
GOOFY

I thought we was havin funWhats
the matter

MAX
(angrily)
Nothing Lets just goCome on

Goofy walks up and unlocks the car door for Max then heads
around to the drivers side Max gets in and shuts the door
Goofy joins him after a moment Sadly he hands Max the possum
hat

GOOFY
Oh you dropped your hat

The sight of the hat pushes Max over the edge He screams
and in a fit of rage he tears at the hat and throws it
against the window and windshield

MAX

(furiously)
Aahh This is the STUPIDEST
vacationYou DRAG me from home
you jam me in this DUMB car then
drive a MILLION miles away to see
some stupid RAT showCall me when
the trips over

Max rolls down the window and throws out the possum hat that
Goofy had bought him Goofy hangs his head crushed He starts
the car and backs out accidentally running over the hat He
looks back briefly then pulls out into the stormy night As
they drive away the camera pans down to show a close up of
the battered hat accompanied by mournful music

EXT PINE FOREST

The scene opens with an overhead view of Goofy pitching a
tent in a makeshift campsite The camera pans left to show
Max sitting on a rock at the edge of a creek absent-mindedly
stirring the water with a stick and watching some fish He
swirls the water and in his imagination Roxannes face
appears in the ripples He smiles halfheartedly Suddenly
Goofy approaches in the water and his feet destroy the
illusion Max looks up at him

GOOFY
(carefully)
Hey Maxyou wanna get in some
fishin practice Just a couple a
days “til we get to Lake Destiny

Max gets up and begins to walk away - leaving a line in the
dirt as he drags his stick

MAX
Maybe later

Goofy turns away depressed and leaves the creekside Max
throws his stick into the water

EXT GOOFYS CAMPSITE

Goofy is putting some materials in the tent and his head is
inside when the ground begins to rumble and shake Suddenly
the dark shadow of a large machine passes over him The
vehicle straddles Goofy and the tent Several large clamping
feet jam into the ground viciously around the tent A large
spinning blade on a long arm fells rows of trees A satellite
dish pops out of the machines roof scanning the sky A
large platform flips down from its side revealing a patio
table and chair set A spa and miniature basketball court

pop out A swimming pool complete with water and a bowling
lane with balls also emerge before the noise ceases A wide
shot reveals that the contraption is a huge RV Max comes

out of the woods to see what is going on and is awed by the
sight

MAX
Whoa Now THATs camping

Goofy pulls his head out of the tent - still not noticing
the RV that is now situated over him

GOOFY
Did you say something Max

Just as he finishes his phrase the big metal door wings
down and lands on his head with a resounding clang A thick
mist billows out surrounding a shadowy but familiar figure

GOOFY
OwPete

PETE
(surprised)
Goofy Oh well what a serendipity-
doo-dahWhod a thunk it huh

Max brightens up with the prospect of seeing his best friend

MAX
Is PJ here

PETE
Oh yeah Im sure hes loafin around
here somewhere

INT PETES RV
Stand Out is playing loudly inside the RV while PJ is

cleaning He is singing and dancing around the room as he
buffs the floor and dusts

Max pokes his head in the RV door and after a bit of surprise
initially he smiles at PJs silly routine

MAX
(to himself)
What a goob

Max enters the RV and approaches the mammoth stereo straining
against the volume of the sound He shuts the music off but
PJ doesnt noticeand continues his song for a bit before

he notices Max

PJ

PJ

swims away in a cloud of ink

the RV

EXT BOWLING LANE ON ROOF OF RV

Goofy watches as Pete bowls on his rooftop lane as they talk

PETE

Oh I dont know whats wrongJust

PETE

up in the gutter

Pete rolls his ball down the lane as he finishes the phrase
The ball strikes the pins and knocks them all down - except
one Pete looks surprised

GOOFY
Too bad Petealmost
Pete looks angrily at Goofy and decides to prove his point
He bellows at PJ

PETE
Almost Ha Watch thisPJ

PJ rushes to Pete and stands at attention - as if in the
military

PJ
(frantically)
Yes sir Coming sir Yes sir

Pete points down the lane at the remaining pin PJ Knows
what hes supposed to do He runs down and kicks the pin
over He looks back at Pete pleased with himself Pete

immediately begins to celebrate his victory by dancing
around and chanting

PETE
Woo-hoo Strike-o-la Hee-hee ha-ha
Thank you thank you Yes And the
crowd goes wild

Goofy and Max stand speechless in amazement at the spectacle
As PJ rushes back toward Pete Pete fakes a high-five with
him and laughs cruelly PJ looks dejected

PETE
High-five sonPsyche Ha ha ha
Say Goofwhy dont you two stay
for dinner

PJs face brightens and Max smiles

MAX
Cool

GOOFY
Oh no thanks Peteuh Max and I

Goofy puts his hand on Maxs shoulder and musses his hair as
he says this Max gets angry and flings Goofys hands aside

MAX
(angrily)
Aw Dad We can do it tomorrowso
uh what are we havin

GOOFY
(surprised)
But Max I thought-

Pete elbows Goofy and quietly gives him advice

PETE

(quietly)
Ahem Under your thumb Goof

Goofy thinks for a moment and his face hardens He sets his
jaw and confronts Max

GOOFY
(sternly)
Maximillian

MAX
(surprised and annoyed)

GOOFY
(sternly)
Get your gear little man Were

Max frowns and sets his jaw challenging Goofy Goofy responds
with authority

GOOFY
(loudly)
And I mean NOW
Max turns away and leaves defeated
MAX
(to himself)
Argh

Goofy looks triumphantly at Pete and they wink and exchange
thumbs-ups

Goofy strides off
EXT WOODLAND LAKE

The water of a quiet stream is disturbed when Goofy pushes
an unwilling Max out into the stream - both of them in waders

MAX
Dad I dont even know how to fish
GOOFY
Oh come on That never stopped
meLet me show you a little family

secret - handed down through about
twelve or thirteen Goof generations
The Perfect Cast

MAX
(sarcastically)
The Perfect what

GOOFY
The Perfect Cast My Dad taught it
to me when I was about your
ageokay nowwatch carefully

Max watches unimpressed as Goofy shakes his body around to
loosen up and demonstrates the cast

GOOFY
You gotta be loooooose
relaaaaxedyou put your feet apart
thenten oclock two oclock
quarter to three touchate twist
over pot-o-dew Ima little tea
pot and the wind up

Goofy swings the pole backward to wind up for the cast and
he inadvertently hooks a steak on Petes nearby barbecue
grill He makes the cast and snatches it away Pete who was
looking the other way looks back to his steak and is
surprised to find it gone

GOOFY
AND LET “ER FLY

Goofy swings the pole and sends the steak flying He looks
proudly at Max who is still frowning imperiously

GOOFY
The Perfect Cast

The steak overshoots the water and lands on the opposite
side After a moment a shadow covers it followed by an
approaching pair of large feet

The camera pans upward to show Bigfoot eating a tree branch
He smells the steak looks down and spies it Goofy doesnt
realize what is going on and he continues his demonstration

GOOFY
and now we reel ‘er in

Bigfoot looks at the branch the steak and back again He
decides the steak looks better and throws the stick away

He prepares to eat the steak when a tug from the line sends

it hopping a bit After recoiling in fear he gets angry and
attempts to catch the treat - which is now speeding away as
Goofy reels in his line Bigfoot roaring makes several
unsuccessful attempts to catch the steak and is eventually
dragged underwater Goofy is still fighting the line thinking
hes caught a fish

GOOFY
Whoa Quick get the camera

Max retrieves the camera and hands it to Goofy who begins
filming - thinking hes going to film a large fish hes
caught

GOOFY
Must be over three pounds I dont
want to miss this

Goofy pans the camcorder upwards and sees Bigfoot through

the viewfinder who is holding a fish in his mouth Goofy
looks at him in amazement Max however realizes the trouble
theyre in

GOOFY
(incredulously)
Look Max
MAX

(screaming)
Uhda-da-Dad ITS BIGFOOOOOT

GOOFY
Could you back up a bit Mr Foot
Youre out of focus

Bigfoot roars angrily and Goofy and Max flee and Goofy

swings the pole in the process The steak on the end of the
line is yanked out of Bigfoots mouth and flies through the
air It hits Pete in the face and he pulls it off angrily

PETE
Whats the idea - BIGFOOT

He Looks in their direction and sees Bigfoot chasing them
toward him Pete grabs the grill and runs back toward the RV
in fear He tosses the grill inside and slams the door behind
him All the RVs attachments and appendages are jerked inside
quickly and it zooms away leaving behind Goofy and Maxs
tent and a few puddles of water from the pool Goofy is
still taping Bigfoot watching him through the viewfinder as
he runs Tripping over the tent he drops the camera It
continues to film them as they attempt to get into the car

GOOFY
Behold the legendary Bigfootfabled
but seldom - aaahhhhhhhh
Owowoofow

MAX
Dad Quick Hes coming

The car is locked so they both get into the car through the
sunroof Goofy frantically tries to close it behind them

and succeeds just before Bigfoot reaches them Frustrated
Bigfoot jumps onto the cars roof and rocks it back and forth
a few times He sees their camping equipment and decides to
investigate leaving them alone Max and Goofy watch from

the car laying low

MAX
I cant believe it Bigfoot

GOOFY
And I got the only video

MAX
Were gonna be famous

As Max finishes his statement Bigfoot finds the camera and
gleefully pulls the videocassette apart

MAX
(disgusted)
Lets just get outta here

Goofy checks his pockets for the car keys Coming up empty
handed they look at Bigfoot - who is holding the keys
smiling He tosses them away into the forest Goofy gets
discouraged and Max gets angrier still Bigfoot continues to
dig through their baggage wearing a pair of Maxs underwear
on his head Some time later Max and Goofy are still in
the car - waiting

MAX
Is he gone yet

Suddenly two sock-wearing hands appear in front of the
windshield Bigfoot performs a primitive puppet show then
laughs riotously at the performance

BIGFOOT
Me-me-me-megrrrrrgrumbleme-
me-meha ha ha ha

Goofy responds to Maxs question

GOOFY
Nopestill here

Bigfoot runs back to the baggage sending a shower of clothes
and other items across the cars hood while Goofy and Max
talk A grumbling noise is heard

GOOFY
Gee Maxis that Bigfoot or your
stomach

MAX
Man Im starving

A can of soup lands on their hood and lands on end right in
front of them

GOOFY
A-hyuk Alphabet soup comin up

Goofy rolls down the window to reach the soup In the process
he makes a small noise which Bigfoot hears Looking up
alarmed Bigfoot is crushing a can of whipped cream in his
mouth When he sees that Goofy and Max are vulnerable he
begins running toward them roaring Terrified they try to
get their can of soup inside even faster

MAX
DadDADstop playing around
hes coming

Just before he reaches them Goofy manages to roll the window
up and Bigfoot bounces off the car - landing on his back

As he sits up a headphone radio that had been sent flying
lands on his head Disco music begins playing and Bigfoot
reacts with fear After a few moments he begins to enjoy

the music Laughing and moving with the beat

INT GOOFYS CAR

The cigarette lighter in Goofys apartment pops and he
removes it He balances the can of soup on top of the lighter

GOOFY
Wellits nice to know this things
good for somethin

Waiting for the soup to finish Goofy and Max sit looking
away from one another without speaking Suddenly Bigfoot
appears in the window behind them in the distance He dances
to Stayin Alive behind their heads but they dont notice
him After hes gone silence returns Max and Goofy look at
one another simultaneously the they both look away
embarrassed More uncomfor- table silent moments pass when
Goofy begins chuckling without warning

GOOFY
Hmm-hmm-hmmha-ha-ha-ha MAX Whats
so funny

Goofy points to the can of soup warming on the dashboard

GOOFY
Hi Dad Soup

MAX
(curious)
Huh

GOOFY
Oh dont tell me you dont remember
Hi Dad Soup

Max Looks at him with a blank look

GOOFY
Oh come on Sure you do You used
to spell things out using the letters
Like uh Hi Dad or Maxie or -

MAX
(jokingly)
Ambidextrous

GOOFY
Yeah thats - huh Nawlittle
words like uh

MAX
Hasta la vista

GOOFY
Like Bye-bye

MAX
or I pledge allegiance

GOOFY
or I love you-

Goofy stops himself short and looks surprised at what hes
said A soft sad oboe piece begins Max looks equally sad
and they both turn away from one another Max trying to
fill the silence inquires about their meal

MAX
Uhhhis it s-soup yet

GOOFY
Oh almost forgot

Goofy picks up the can and opens it by puncturing the lid
with his big front teeth

MAX
Whoa Whered you learn to do that

Max picks up a Styrofoam cup and Goofy fills it with soup

GOOFY
Your granddad taught me that when
we went to Yosemite

MAX
You two did a lot together huh

GOOFY
(sadly)
Yup

Max looks sadly into his soup Both of them begin at speak
at once but neither hears the other and they both cut
themselves off

MAXGOOFY
(simultaneously)
DadMax
GOOFY
Ummuhhhows the soup

Max drinks some of the soup and answers him He wipes his
mouth but some of the soup remains on his face

MAX
Not badI mean uh (ahem)

Goofy sees the soup and smiles

MAX
What
GOOFY
(shaking his head)
Nothin’

The silence is interrupted by grunts from Bigfoot as the car
lurches back and forth Bigfoot climbs onto the roof and
lays down to sleep

GOOFY
Well we might as well get some
shuteyeI dont think were goin
anywhere tonight

Goofy lays down on the seat and curls up to sleep Max wipes
the soup off his mouth and looks down into the cup
inquisitively swirling the soup around

After a few moments Goofy is roused by a tap to his shoulder
and Max hands him the cup of soup Goofy looks down into the
cup in which the letters now spell Hi Dad Deeply moved

he looks back at Max who is lying down nearly asleep

GOOFY
(whispering)
Hi Maxie

After a brief establishing shot of the exterior of the car
with Bigfoot on top to indicate the passage of time Goofy

is seen sitting upright in the front seat of the car - snoring
loudly Bigfoot is also snoring loudly on the roof Max
however is staring into space with bloodshot eyes unable to
sleep He sits up in the seat and fumbles through the bag
beside him Pulling out a postcard from Lesters Possum Park
he finds a pencil and decides to write to Roxanne

MAX
(voice over of writing)
Dear Roxannecouldnt sleep -

His thought is interrupted by a particularly loud snore by
Goofy and Bigfoot together

MAX
(voice over of writing)
So I thought Id drop you a line
Dad and I are having a great time
Were only days away from LA and I
can hardly wait for thebig
concertugh

He begins to rethink his letter when Goofy yawns and talks
in his sleep

GOOFY
Hi dad
(yawn)
Soup please

Max smiles touchedand decides to do the right thing

MAX
(voice over of writing)
(sigh)
Dear Roxanne sorry I liedIm not
really going to the Powerline concert
You may never want to see me again

Realizing what hes saying Max stops

MAX
Oh man Im dead no matter what I
do

Frustrated he sits back in the seat and kicks the dashboard
The glove compartment pops open and Goofys map springs out
into Maxs lap

He looks at Goofy to be sure hes still asleep then begins
tracing the path on the map with his finger He notices that
their course meets a junction that leads to Los Angeles A
pencil rolls out onto the map stopping in front of him Max
picks up the pencil and debates what to do He nervously
begins erasing the part of the line that leads to Lake
Destiny Idahowatching Goofy to see if hes waking up He
begins drawing a new course on the map when the pencil breaks
The soft sound seems deafening to Max in the silence Goofy
begins to stir Frantic Max grabs the broken point and
continues to draw Goofy begins to wake up as Max quickly
completes the line and returns the map to the glove
compartment He sits back in his seat innocently as Goofy
rouses and looks at Max sleepily

GOOFY
(sleepily)
How many cups of sugar does it take
to get to the moon

MAX
(nervously)
Uhhthree and a half

Having not actually been awake Goofy flops back into the
seat and begins snoring again Max sinks into his seat
relieved He looks at the postcard he had written and tears
jt up Holding the pieces out the window he lets the wind
carry them away From a distance we see the pieces flying
one lands in a tree near the camera - it clearly reads I
lied

EXT TRUCK STOP

A landscape covered with tractor trailer rigs is distinguished
only by a set of small buildings with large signs reading
Diner and Eat and Get Gas

Soft country music plays to set the atmosphere

INT TRUCK STOP

In the truck stop the first view is a reflection of the
diners interior on a bell In the reflection some of the
patrons including Elvis can be seen

The image is disturbed when the cook rings the bell

COOK
Pick up

WAITRESS
Hold your horses

The view pans back as the waitress collects the meals and
heads out through the crowded diner full of chattering people
She arrives at Goofy and Maxs table with their food

WAITRESS
Short stack

GOOFY
Right here

WAITRESS

Here you go hon

She turns to Max to hand him his food but he is preoccupied
and doesnt hear her

WAITRESS
EggseggsEGGS

MAX
Oh Oh yeah yeah right
heresorry

WAITRESS
Here you go cutie

The waitress sits his food in front of him and he looks down
at it The eggs and bacon are forming a smiley face Goofy
begins eating his pancakes when he notices Max absently
picking at his food He thinks for a moment then looks at
the map - and decides what to do

GOOFY
Max I think we need to talk about
this

Max thinking hes been caught in the act stutters nervously

MAX
Huh

GOOFY
Seems to me you need to start takin
some responsibility around here

Goofy stands up at his seat taps his water glass and draws
everyones attention Max shrinks into his seat embarrassed

GOOFY
Excuse me uh can I have your
attention please I Goofy hereby
dub my son Maximillian official
navigator and head which-way-er of
this here road trip

Goofy hands Max the map ceremoniously The other people in
the diner applaud and cheer loudly

MAX
(incredulous)
Seriously

GOOFY
Im not even lookin at the map
anymore As a matter of fact you
can pick all the stops from here to
Lake Destiny I trust you
wholeheartedly son

Max looks back at Goofy sheepishly Goofy raises his mug of
coffee for a toast and Max joins him with his water
glassgingerly

GOOFY
To the open road

MAX
To theopenroad

A piano slide leads into a jazzpop tune that provides the
background music for a music montage They clink their cups
together then the car is seen leaving the diner

MUSIC MONTAGE (descriptions of segments)

An overhead view of the creased map shows Goofys car driving
around on it surrealistically with clouds overhead casting
shadows on the map as they head toward their destination

Goofy attempts to ride a jet ski plunging into the water

and shooting out again He loses control and runs it aground
Proceeding up the beach he slides past people sunbathing
and through a row of cabanas He emerges on the other side
dressed in a variety of womens clothing

A close up of the cars front wheel follows and the wheel
blows out Max and Goofy attempt to change the tire ina
series of segments that are intersper- sed through the
montage Here they both reach for the spare tire simult-
aneously and hit their heads together Recoiling Max rubs
his head and Goofy gets the tire

Max and Goofy ride a roller coaster side by side Max enjoys
himself immensely but Goofy gets sick Emerging from the
restroom (labeled with a symbol that looks like him) holding
his stomach gingerly Goofy is greeted by Max who cheerfully
offers him a tray of junk foods - hot dogs french fries
nachos and soft drinks Upon seeing the food Goofy grabs

his mouth and races back into the restroom to throw up again

A monster truck crushes the roofs of a row of small cars
while Max and Goofy look on at a monster truck rally Max
swinging a giant foam number one finger notices that Goofy
is holding his head in an attempt to block out the noise

Another driving across the USA map sequence shows them
getting closer to their destination

Max uncovers Goofys eyes in order to surprise him with
their current stop Goofy opens his eyes to see the Worlds
Largest House of Yarn Excited he yells Oh Boy grabs
Max by the arm and drags him along to see the house

Max and Goofy are watching a mime on a street corner The
mime is performing the standard pulling on a rope routine
appearing to pull on an overhead rope Goofy nudges Max and
winks at him He approaches the mime pretending hes
following an imaginary wall He makes a scissors motion with
his fingers and the mime gestures as if hes holding his
rope out to be cut Goofy smiles and makes a cutting motion
where the rope would be and the mime smiles back for a moment
before a piano falls and lands on him Goofy and Max turn
around and begin whistling innocently as they slip away

Another map sequence establishes them as being closer still
to Lake Destiny

Returning to the tire changing sequence Goofy is in the
background pumping air into the new tire while Max struggles
trying to remove the blown tire

He slips and the tire wrench flies through the air like a
boomerang Goofy ducks and it just misses his head
Returning the wrench hits the jack supporting the car The
car falls propelling the old tire off at high speed

It hits Goofy in the chest just as hes lifting the new tire
He sends the new tire flying and it lands on the cars axle -
just as the car is on its way down from a bounce Max and
Goofy exchange pleased glances

Goofy is holding a camera at arms length in an attempt to
take a picture of himself and Max standing in a cave He is
oblivious to the many eyes behind him watching He takes

the picture and the flash disturbs the bats They fly toward
them Goofy and Max run out the opening to the cave the

sign above it reads Carls Butt Caverns

A batter at a baseball game the Goofy and Max are attending
hits the ball It heads for them and Max readies himself
and his glove in hopes of catching it He stands up to catch
the ball but fumbles it Goofy makes a dive to catch it and
he ends up going over the edge of the balcony
He falls but manages to catch himself on a string of
streamers As the streamers stretch he falls right through
the dugout roof where he is suspended momentarily He hands
the ball to the player sitting there on the bench and he
signs it The streamers spring back flinging Goofy back to
his seat - Max catches him and they exchange pleased glances

A close up of the cars wheel shows the new tire is almost
completely in place Max and Goofy are alternately turning
the wrench When they finish they slap hands in a high five

The music comes to a close when the car is seen driving off
into the sunset but instead it turns into the parking lot
of the Neptune Inn

INT GOOFY AND MAXS HOTEL ROOM

After a brief establishing shot of Goofy and Max carrying
their luggage through the door they emerge in their room
It is lit in an eerie green light that befits the nautical
theme The waterbeds are transparent with fish swimming
inside and the rest of the decor is similar

GOOFY
Gawrsh

Max sees the waterbed and jumps on it The water sloshes him
back and forth Goofy looks at and feels the material the
furniture is made of

MAX
Who-ho-hoa Check out the bed

GOOFY
Check out the dressercoral

On the wall there is a night light shaped like Ariel which
both Goofy and Max admire

MAX
Nice lamp

GOOFY
Classy choice there navigator

The quiet is broken by a loud pounding at the door followed

by yelling Goofy and Max begin to approach the door gingerly

PETE
This is the Police Weve got the
place surrounded see You Goofs
come out with your hands up

Pete breaks the door open and pretends to fire a machine gun
at them he Knocks Goofy and Max backwards onto the floor

PETE
B-b-b-b-b-bang Ha ha ha You
shouldve seen the look on your face

Goofy looks at Max and tries to pretend that he wasnt
frightened but Max doesnt believe it

GOOFY
Ah-hyuk You really had him fooled
Pete

MAX

Me You jumped out of your skin

Goofy and Max begin shoving and punching each other playfully

GOOFY
Nuh-uh Is just pretending for your
sake
MAX
Oh right sure
GOOFY
Did too
MAX
Did not

Goofy grabs Max and begins mussing up his hair both laugh

PETE
Oh ho aint this sweet

Pete tries to wise Goofy up by making him distrust Max He
grabs Goofy by the arm and quietly gives him advice

PETE
(quietly)
Dont Let him fool you with that
buddy-buddy act nowunder your
thumb

He releases Goofy who is looking more and more concerned

PETE
So Since were all bein palsy-
walsy here how about lettin me
hook up the RV

Pete grabs Goofy around the shoulders again
GOOFY

(reluctantly)
Well

PETE
Oh its just a tiny little extension
cord youll hardly even notice it

Goofy relents so Pete calls PJ to bring the hookup

GOOFY
Oh okay

PETE
GreatPJ

PJ appears in the doorway straining under the weight of a
huge multipart tube Pete points him toward the room
instructing him to hook it up Goofy and Max stand speechless
and wide-eyed at the sight

PETE
Hey Goofwhy dont you order us a
pizza this might take a while

INT GOOFY AND MAXS HOTEL ROOM

The scene switches to an exterior shot of the inn to indicate
the passage of time The we see the interior of the room
again Max and PJ are sitting on the bed and the floor
respectively talking Goofy enters in a swimsuit and carrying
a pizza for them to eat

PJ
No you ma-
(gasp)

GOOFY
Here you go kidsIm gonna go

PJ
Oh okay sir

MAX
Alright

Goofy leaves the room as Max and PJ start eating

PJ
I cant believe you man Whatever
made you think your Dad would fall
for a stupid idea like that

MAX
It wasnt stupid

While they are talking Pete begins to enter the room to
talk to them He hears what theyre talking about and decides
to stay outside and eavesdrop on their conversation

PJ
Come on it was really stupid
Changing the map

MAX
I-I didnt know what I was doing
alright I-I-I wasI was PANICKED
I

EXT HOT TUB

The hot tub is surrounded by a high fence topped with flaming
torches and various plants Goofy eases himself into the
steamy water A soft green glow similar to the one in the
room shines from in the water He begins to relax and sinks
under the surface of the water After a few moments a large
figure appears above him He sits up and sees Pete standing
over him in a small tight pink swimsuit

PETE
Takin a break from the MTV
generation huh Heh hehI cant
blame ya

Pete gets in the water and much of it splashes out over the
edges

PETE
People are always puttin too much
water in these thingsso ummyou

along just hunky-dorey huh

GOOFY
Yeah Its been great You know
its funny but none of your
techniques worked for me The harder
I tried the worse it got Once I
eased up things just clicked

Goofy gets up and moves toward Pete He sits on the stairs
near the handrail and begins to relax sinking back into the
water

PETE
Oh thats swellso uh no problems
then huh

GOOFY

Not a one
Goofy begins to relax again but Pete grabs his attention by

telling him about the map

PETE
(sigh)
I just hate to be the bearer of bad
news butuh

Goofy sits back up again nervously

Goofy gets out of the hot tub and begins heading toward the

room

GOOFY
(curious)
What is it Pete
PETE

GOOFY
(nervously)

PETE
(angrily)
Heymy son RESPECTS me

GOOFY
(quietly)

PETE

INT GOOFYS CAR

Goofy walks away from the hot tub slowly He approaches the
car and their room and gets in the car As he opens the
door the green glow momentarily succumbs to the bright
white Light from the cars dome light He shuts it again and
the green glow returns He sits in the drivers seat and
begins reaching for the glove compartment to check the map
He decides not to do it and hits the steering wheel in
frustration As he does this the glove compartment pops
open revealing the map

INT GOOFY AND MAXS HOTEL ROOM

After a brief shot of the exterior of the Neptune Inn we
see Max and PJ still watching TV when Goofy walks in looking
shell-shocked Max turns around and greets him cheerfully
and unknowingly

MAX
Hi Dad

The only sound to be heard is the voice of Powerline on TV

POWERLINE
even if I gotta shout out loud

Unnerved Max tries to improve the situation
MAX
Sorry about the messI-I1ll clean
jt up

Max looks at PJ and shrugs confused Goofy is still silent
as he turns the lights off and lays down in bed

PJ
I think Id better go

MAX
See ya Peej

PJ
Dont forgetPowerline

MAX
Shhhhhhhh

INT GOOFYS CAR

Goofy and Max are driving down the road in silence Goofy
still has the same shocked expression on his face Goofy
decides to give Max a chance to make the right choice and
hopes to avoid a confrontation They exchange uncomfortable
looks

GOOFY
Well here you go navigatorjust
follow my route on the map son

MAX
Okay uh ummuh

Max looks nervously at the map then up at the signs
indicating the upcoming junction which are zipping overhead

GOOFY
Here comes our junction

Max still mumbles undecided as they careen toward the center
divider on the highway

GOOFY
Okay Maxnow this is it left or
right

MAX
Ummuhh

GOOFY
Come on Max
AaaaaahhhhhLEFT

Goofy lurches the car to the left and hits the center divider
in the process

MAX
Oh

MAX
(sigh)
Uh how bout a song Dad

Goofy sinks lower and lower - getting angrier and angrier -
as Max continues to try to pretend nothings happening

MAX
Uh a game A game Yeah Yeah a
game Okay uhman or woman Man
Manokay uhWalt Disney

Finally Goofy snaps He veers off the road into a scenic
lookout point and stops the car He opens the door and
struggles to get out while wearing a seat belt He releases
it and storms away and begins looking out over the edge
Max decides to try to make amends and approaches Goofy

MAX
(sigh)
Dad uh listenabout my
directions

Goofy turns away twice refusing to acknowledge him

MAX
Can you listen to me I gotta tell
you something Dad

GOOFY
(angrily)
Why bother Im probably too stupid
to understand anyway right

MAX
(disgusted)
Forget it

Max walks back to the car kicks the tire angrily then leans
against the rear bumper After a moment the car rolls out
from behind him and he falls to the ground with a thud He
looks back to see what happened and realizes that the car is
rolling away

MAX
(surprised)
OofH-h-hey The car

GOOFY
(angrily)
What Now you wanna drive too

MAX
No Dad The car Look

GOOFY
The car

Both of them begin running after the car frantically

GOOFY
Whatd you do now Max
MAX
I didnt do anything Dad I only

touched it

The car passes under a low-hanging rock formation and all
their luggage is knocked off of the roof A skateboard flies
off and lands on the road in front of Goofy - who
inadvertently steps on it Max jumps on the back of the board
and rides with him They zip back and forth trying to get
around the side of the car

GOOFY
Oh ohhhhwhoa You locked it

Goofy grabs onto the drivers side of the car and tries to
open the door but its locked

MAX
I locked it Its your door you
locked it

Max leaves Goofy hanging on and manages to get to the
passenger side door He opens it and gets in the car He
unlocks the drivers side door and it opens swinging Goofy
out over the canyon Max pulls the door shut again and opens
the window for Goofy to get through

GOOFY
Well you distracted mewhoa

Max pulls Goofy into the car up to his waist and he loses
his pants

MAX
You shouldve put the brake on

GOOFY
Why dont you just put it on yourself

Goofy grabs the brake lever and pulls it to stop the car
but it breaks off in his hand

MAX
See You ruin everything

The car slides out on the guide rail and hangs over the
canyon
GOOFY
Well you ruined the vacation

MAX
I ruined it

The guide rail lets loose and the car gets launched into the
air It bounces off of several rock formations while Max
continues to argue with Goofy bouncing them both around the
cars interior

MAX
I neverwanted to goon this
stupid vacatioooo00000000n

The car bounces off the last rock formation then plummets a
long way before landing in the river below

EXT CAR IN CHURNING RIVER

MAX

(gasp)
Now look where you got us Dad

GOOFY
Where I got us

They both struggle to get back on the car Goofy boosts Max
up onto its roof

MAX
You shouldve let me stay at home

Max helps pull Goofy onto the roof

GOOFY
Why So youd end up in prison

MAX
Prison What are you talking about

The car bounces and spins wildly through a series of rapids

GOOFY
Your principal called me You even
lied to me

MAX

GOOFY
I was only tryin to take my boy
fishin okay

The car slides over a small waterfall into calm water
car stops bobbing and the sun begins shining on them

Goofy and Max sit with their backs to each other in silence

MAX
Im NOT your little boy anymore
Ive grown up Ive got my own life
now

GOOFY
I KNOW that I just wanted to be
part of it

GOOFY
Youre my son Maxno matter how
big you get youll always be my

The

as the car continues to float gently through the canyon
Birds fly overhead and soft music begins Max breaks the

silence

MAX
There are times you drive me shall
we say bananasand your mind is
missing no offense a screw

GOOFY
None taken

The car floats into a cavern with blue ripples reflecting
onto its ceiling from the water

MAX
Still whatever mess I land in who
is always understandin Nobody else
but you

GOOFY
Oh your moodiness is now and then
bewilderinand your values may
be so to speak askew

MAX

GOOFY

face each catastrophe Nobody else
but you

The car exits the cavern into a slow wide part of the river

GOOFY and MAX
Nobody else but you its just our
luck were stuck together Nobody
else but you its crazy enough to
believe well come through

They both take off their shoes and splash the water with
their feet

MAX
So your jokes are all lets face
it prehistoric

GOOFY
And your music sounds like monkeys
in a zoo

GOOFY and MAX

But when Life become distressin
who will I be SOSn

A small fish grabs Maxs toe and he lifts it out of the water
momentarily Goofy lifts up his foot to find that a huge
ugly fish has swallowed it He quickly shakes it off and
sends it flying

MAX
If youre having trouble guessing
heres a clueThough he seems
intoxicated hes just highly
animatedand hes nobody else but

The car drifts into a whirlpool and they get drawn under as
they sing

GOOFY and MAX
Nobody else but you weve turned
into a true blue duo Hard times
weve had a fewlLike were thrown
in the drink like were tossed out
of town but when I start to sink

The car resurfaces with a splash and bobs up and down

GOOFY and MAX
With nobody else but Y-O-U

GOOFY
(smooch)

MAX

GOOFY
Well whaddya knowmy Maxie in

The water around the car becomes increasingly choppy and the
light fades

GOOFY
Wellp I think the only thing for us
to do now is to get you up onstage
with this Powerline feller

MAX
Hehuh how are we gonna do that

GOOFY
Now you just leave that up to me

MAX
No Dad reallyI-I think we should
you Know just forget it

GOOFY
Now how come you always think Im

calamity

Max looks downstream and does a doubletake The water is
vanishing over a waterfall and the car is heading directly
for it

MAX
Uh uh D-D-Dad

GOOFY
Whats wrong now

MAX
Look

GOOFY

Hyuk A waterfallWATERFALL

EXT CAR IN RAPIDS

The car spins and sloshes and Goofy falls off Max continues
to hold on

GOOFY and MAX
(frightened)
AAAHHHH

Max is quickly carried downstream on the car leaving Goofy
behind

MAX
Daaaaaaad

GOOFY
Max

The current slams Goofy against a rock and he grabs onto it
Some of their luggage floats by including the fishing rods
case which hits him in the back of the head Goofy gets the
fishing rod out and runs downstream on the rocks He runs
out on a log in hopes of being able to get Max with the
pole

GOOFY
Grab a hold Max

Goofy holds out the end of the pole Max dives for it but
misses Landing back in the water with the car Goofy stands
helplessly as Max continues to float toward the falls

MAX
Aahwhoa

(gasp)
aaahhh

Goofy casts the line and snags the front bumper on the car
The weight of the car pulls Goofy in He flies downstream
and hits some rocks which he uses for leverage Finally the
weight of the car overpowers him and it goes over the falls
Max gets caught in a tarp and falls with it Suddenly the
tarp unfolds and begins supporting Max in the air using the
updraft from the falls

MAX
(terrified)
Dad

Goofy still in the water is unable to stop himself As he
goes over the falls he extends the pole toward Max Max

grabs the pole and they both swing downward - still supported
by the updraft on the tarp They smile at each other
momentarily Suddenly the cork handgrip on the fishing pole
slides off and Goofy plummets into the mist below
GOOFY
(falling)
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH

Max looks at the end of the pole and thinks about The Perfect

Cast Without hesitation he attempts to perform it

MAX
(hurriedly)
Ten oclock two oclock quarter to
three touchate twist Im a little
tea pot and FLY

Max sends the line flying after Goofy

GOOFY
(falling)
AAHHHH

The line is still loose and continuing to drop Maxs face
falls when he realizes it hasnt caught Suddenly the line
becomes taut and Max gets pulled downward with the added
weight He begins to reel it in furiously Goofy emerges
from the mist suspended by the hook

MAX
Aahaaahh
(grunt)
Haha

GOOFY
(sentimentally)
The Perfect Cast

Max and Goofy grab one another firmly and hug Both have
tears in their eyes

As they embrace Goofys map lands on his head He lifts it
up and looks at it

MAX
Boy this has been one crazy
vacation

He tosses the map away and it is carried off into the wind

GOOFY
And its not over yet

the concert is being held Their care searchlights beaming
all around and a blimp circling
People are crowding in past the turnstiles and filling the

Yeah yeah

Two attractive dancers walk in front of Max and he has a
change of heart He watches them walk by and loses sight of
Goofy

MAX

Onstage the lights dim as a giant sphere is lifted up
Electricity arcs all around the sphere and it explodes
leaving only Powerline in its place He stands up and begins
the song

POWERLINE

youll understand To set the world
in motion by reaching out for each
others hand Maybe well discover
what we should have Known all along
One way or another togethers where

Still backstage Max is looking for Goofy when he sees
Powerline and the dancers performing onstage and stops to
watch A guard spies him and tries to catch him but Max
dives through the guards legs and runs away

MAX
Dad

GUARD

dressing room of a very heavy background singer She screams
and punches him back out the door He falls backwards into
some of the stage equipment and gets tangled

words

INT BACKSTAGE

The guard in pursuit of Max makes a lunge and misses Max
grabs onto a lighting scaffold that is being lifted into
position Goofy trapped inside another of the pyrotechnic
spheres is being lifted onto the stage The sphere arcs and
explodes Like Powerlines and Goofy is sent flying onto the

stage He Lands onstage beside Powerline with the tip of his
hair still flaming Powerline gives him a curious look

GOOFY
Excuse meMax Ooh Aaaaahhh

Max is mortified but has a brainstorm

MAX
Hey Dad Dad Do the Perfect Cast

Goofy hears him and begins performing the motions of The
Perfect Cast much to the amazement of Powerline and the
audience Powerline continues the song and Goofy dances with
him

POWERLINE
If youre ever lonely - stop you
dont have to be after all its
only a beat away from you to me

SINGERS
Take a look inside and see

The guard climbs on the scaffolding to catch Max Max bumps
one of the lights and the beam gets in the guards eyes He
falls backwards and his weight is too much for it The
scaffolding breaks loose Max grabs a rope the guard grabs
Max by the legs and they both swing downward

MAX
Whoa Whoaaaaahhhh

The guard flies into one of the large monitors smashing it
in a wild shower of sparks and light Max swings back and
ends up sliding onto the stage He comes to rest directly
between Goofy and Powerline They both look surprised
momentarily then Max begins to dance and they join him

POWERLINE
